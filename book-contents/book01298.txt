NOW THAT 
WE'RE MONTHLY- 



N OW that IF has gone monthly, 
we start what we sincerely hope 
— and believe — will be the finest 
•equence of serials, novelettes, com- 
plete short novels and short stories 
the magazine has ever known! 

To begin with, take a look at this^ 
issue’s contents page. A brand-new 
Robert A. Heinlein and a complete 
A. E. Van Vogt — there’s a lineup 
you haven’t seen anywhere for a 
good many years. Next on the heels 
of . the Heinlein serial, we have a 
Keith Laumer, The Hounds of Hell. 
And after that another three-part 
serial, this one Doc Smith’s final, 
mightiest Skylark story. Skylark 
DuQuesne. And in between and all 
around them, the greatest collection 
of shorts and novelettes and features 
we can find. 

We haven’t spent much time in 
these pages in telling you what we 
were trying to do with IF — figuring 
you could See for yourself what we 
were doing, after all. But by now we 
hop6 it has become clear that IF is 
fifling the gap in the science-fiction 
q>ectrum that has unaccountably 
been vacated for the past dozen-odd 
years. Adventure. Excitement. 
Drama. Color. Not hack pulp-writing 



or gory comic-strip blood and thun- 
der, but the sort of story that at- 
tracted most of us to science fiction 
in the first place. 

In order to do this, we have had 
to go after all the old-time masters 
and try to lure them back into the 
fold . and, at the same time, try 
to develop new ones. As you have 
seen, in every issue for the past 
couple of years we have made it a 
point to publish at least one story 
by a brand-new, never-before-in- 
print writer. (This issue, for example, 
we bring you a wild and wonderful 
mathematical delight by Norman 
Kagan, a graduate student in one 
of New York’s universities.) 

We think this is beginning to pay 
off for all of us — and hope you 
feel the same! 

O ne last thing: In order to get 
the present big chunk of fic- 
tion in this issue, we had to scrimp 
on the pages for features — which 
meant eliminating our letter column. 
Hue and Cry. But it will be back 
. and don’t let its temporary ab- 
sence keep you from sending in your 
letters of comment. We need them!

iiTt’s not a hearing aid,” Hubert 

X Farnham explained. “It’s a 
radio, tuned to the emergency fre- 
quency.” 

Barbara Wells stopped with a bite 
halfway to her mouth. “Mr. Farn- 
ham! You think they are going to 
attack?” 

Her host shrugged. “The Kremlin 
doesn’t let me in on its secrets.” 



His son said, “Dad, quit scaring 
the ladies. Mrs. Wells — ” 

“Call me ‘Barbara.’ I’m going to 
ask the court to let me drop the 
‘Mrs.’ ” 

“You don’t need permission.” 
“Watch it. Barb,” his sister Karen 
said. “Free advice is expensive.” 
“Shaddap. Barbara, with all re- 
spect to my worthy father, he sees 
spooks. There is not going to be a 
war.”

“I hope you’re right,” Barbara 
Wells said soberly. “Why do you 
think so?” 

“Because the communists are 
realists. They never risk a war that 
would hurt them, even if they could 
win. So they won’t risk one they 
can’t win.” 

“Then I wish,” his mother said, 
“that they would stop having these 
dreadful crises. Cuba. All that fuss 
about Berlin — as if anybody cared! 
And now this. It makes a person 
nervous. Joseph!” 

“Yes, ma’am?” 

“You fetch me coffee. And 
brandy. Cafe royale.” 

“Yes, ma’am.” The houseboy, a 
young Negro, removed her plate, 
barely touched. 

Young Farnham said, “Dad, it’s 
not these phony crises that has 
Mother upset; it’s the panicky way 
you behave. You must stop it.” 
“No.” 

“You must! Mother didn’t eat 
her dinner . and all because of 
that silly button in your ear. You 
can’t — ” 

“Drop it, Duke.” 

“Sir?” 

“When you moved into your own 
apartment, we agreed to live as 
friends. As my friend your opinions 
are welcome. But that does not make 
you free to interfere between your 
mother — my wife — and myself.” 
His wife said, “Now, Hubert.” 
“Sorry, Grace.” 

“You’re too harsh on the boy. It 
does make me nervous.” 

“Duke is not a boy. And I’ve done 
nothing to make you nervous.” 



“I’m sorry, too. Mother. But if 
Dad regards it as interference, 
well — ” Duke forced a grin — 
“I’ll have to find a wife of my own 
to annoy. Barbara, will you marry 
me?” 

“No, Duke. Anyway, I agree with 
your father. Every car in our family 
has a survival kit. My father’s idea. 
If anything happened. Pops would 
expect me to head up into the moun- 
tains.” 

“You won’t need to.” 

“Sir?” 

“Dad means,” explained Karen, 
“that you are welcome in our panic 
hole.” 

B arbara showed a questioning look. 

Her host said, “Our bomb shel- 
ter. ‘Farnham’s Folly’ my son calls 
it. I think you would be safer there 
than you would be running for the 
hills — despite the fact that we are 
only ten miles from a MAMMA 
Base. If an alarm comes, we’ll duck 
into it. Right, Joseph?” 

“Yes, sir! That way I stay on your 
payroll.” 

“The hell you do. You’re fired the 
instant the sirens sound — and I 
start charging you rent.” 

“Do I pay rent, too?” asked Bar- 
bara. 

“You wash dishes. Everybody 
does. Even Duke.” 

“Count me out,” Duke said grim- 

ly- 

“Eh? Not that many dishes. Son.” 
“Fm not joking. Dad; Khrushchev 
said he would bury us — and you’re 
making it come true. I’m not going 
to crawl into a hole in the ground!”

IF 




“As you wish, sir.“ 

“Sonny boy!” His mother put 
down her cup. “If an attack comes, 
of course you’re going into the shel- 
ter!” She blinked back tears. “Prom- 
ise Mother.” 

Young Farnham looked stubborn, 
then sighed. “All right. If an attack 
comes — If an alarm sounds, I mean; 
there isn’t going to be an attack — 
in go into your panic hole. But, 
Dad, this is just to soothe Mother’s 
nerves.” 

“Nevertheless you are welcome.” 

“Okay. Let’s go into the living 
room and break out the cards — with 
a firm understanding that we drop 
the subject.” 

Barbara played as Farnham’s part- 
ner, and the father and son had a 
private wager of a cent a point. The 
stakes made her tense, even though 
it was not her money. Her nervous- 
ness was increased by suspicion that 
her partner was a match player with 
a lot of experience. 

Her nerves relaxed, though not 
her care, as it began to appear that 
Mr. Farnham found her bidding 
satisfactory. But she welcomed the 
rest that came from being dummy. 
She spent these vacations studying 
Hubert Farnham. 

She decided that she liked him, 
for the way he handled his family 
and for the way he played bridge — 
quietly, thoughtfully, exact in bid- 
ding, precise and sometimes brilliant 
in play. She admired the way he 
squeezed out the last trick, of a con- 
tract in which she had forced them 
too high, by having the boldness to 
sluff an ace. 



T_T ubert Farnham looked up from 
A the last trick. “Three spades, 
game and rubber. Well bid, part- 
ner.” 

She flushed again. “Well played, 
you mean. I invited too much.” 

“Not at all. At worst we would 
have been down one. If you don’t 
bet, you can’t win. Karen, has 
Joseph gone to bed?” 




“Studying. He’s got a quiz.” 

“I thought we might invite him to 
cut in. Barbara, Joseph is the best 
player in this house — always a^i- 
dacity at the right time. Plus the 
fact that he is studying to be an ac- 
countant and never forgets a card. 
Karen, can you find us something 
without disturbing Joseph?” 

Spect ah kin. Boss. Vodka and 
tonic for you?” 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD

“And muching food.” 

“Come on, Barbara. Let’s buttle.” 
Hubert Farnham watched them 
fo, while thinking it was shame that 
so nice a child as Mrs. Wells should 
have had a sour marriage. A sound 
fame of bridge and a good disposi- 
tion. Gangly and horsefaced, per- 
haps. But a nice smile and a mind of 
her own. If Duke had any gump- 
tion — 

But Duke didn’t have any. Farn- 
ham went to where his wife was nod- 
ding by the television receiver, and 
said, “Grace? Grace darling, ready 
for bed?” — then helped her into her 
bedroom. 

Karen came in carrying drinks, 
followed by Barbara. “Hi! Barb got 
a look at our kitchen and decided to 
Make crepes Suzettes.” 

“Fine. If you will snap the tele- 
wion on, we might get part of the 
Im o’clock roundup.” 

" — agreed in principal to three 
mti of four of the Presidents major 
points and has agreed to meet again 
$o discuss the fourth point, the pre- 
aence of their nuclear submarines in 
our coastal waters. It may now be 
oafely stated that the crisis, the most 
acute in post-World-War-Two years, 
does seem to he tapering off to a 
mutual accommodation that both 
countries can live with. We pause 
to bring you exciting news from Gen- 
eral Motors followed by an analysis 
in depth — ” 

Karen turned it down. Duke said, 
“Just as I said. Dad. You can take 
that cork out of your ear.” 

“Later. Fm busy with crepes 
Suzettes. Barbara, I’ll expect these 



for breakfast every morning.” 

“Dad, quit trying to seduce her 
and cut the cards. I want to win 
back what I’ve lost.” 

“That’ll be a long night.” Mr. 
Farnham finished eating, stood up to 
put his plate aside; the doorbell rang. 
“I’ll answer it.” 

He went to the door, returned 
shortly. Karen said, “Who was it, 
Daddy? I cut for you. You and I 
are partners. Look pleased.” 

“I’m delighted. But remember 
that a count of eleven is not an 
opening bid. Somebody got lost, I 
guess. Possibly a nut.” 

“My date. You scared him off.” 
“Possibly. A bald-headed old coot, 
very weather-beaten and ragged.” 
“My date,” Karen confirmed. 
“President of the Dekes. Go get 
him. Daddy.” 

“Too late. He took one look at 
me and fled. Whose bid is it?” 
Barbara continued to try to play 
like a machine. But it seemed to her 
that Duke was overbidding; she 
found herself thereby bidding timid- 
ly and had to force herself to over- 
come it. They went set several times 
in a long, dreary rubber which they 
“won” but lost on points. 

I t was a pleasure to lose the next 
rubber with Karen as her part- 
ner. They shifted and again she was 
Mr. Farnham’s partner. He smiled at 
her. “This time we clobber them!” 
“I’ll try.” 

“Just play as you did. By the 
book. Duke will supply the mis- 
takes.” 

“Put your money where your 



10 



IF 




mouth is, Dad. Want a side bet of 
a hundred dollars on this rubber?” 
•‘A hundred it is.” 

Barbara thought about seventeen 
lonely dollars in her purse and got 
nervous. She was still more ner- 
vous when the first hand ended at 
five clubs, bid and made — by 
Duke — and realized that he had 
overbid and would have been down 
one had she covered his finesse. 

Duke said, “Care to double that 
bet. Governor? 

“Okay. Deal.” 

Her morale was bolstered by the 
second hand: her contract at four 
spades and made possible by voids; 
she was able to ruff before cleaning 
out trumps. Her partner’s smile was 
reward enough. But it left her shaky. 

Duke said, “Both teams vulner- 
able, no part score. How’s your 




blood pressure, Daddy-o? Double 
again?” 

“Planning on firing your secre- 
tary?” 

“Speak up, or accept a white 
feather.” 

“Four hundred. You can sell your 
car.” 

Mr. Farnham dealt. Barbara pick- 
ed up her hand and frowned. The 
count was not bad — t^o queens, a 
couple of jacks, an ace, a king — but 
no biddable suit and the king was 
unguarded. It was a strength and dis- 
tribution which she had long tag- 
ged as “just good enough to go set 
on.” She hoped that it would be 
one of those sigh-of-relief hands in 
which everyone passes. 

Her partner picked up his hand 
and glanced at it. “Three no trump.” 

Barbara repressed a gasp, Karen 
did gasp. “Daddy, are you feverish?” 

“Bid.” 

“Pass!” 

Barbara said to herself, “ ‘Dod oh 
dod, what I do now?’ ” 

Her partner’s bid promised 
twenty-five points — and invited 
slam. She held thirteen points. 
Thirty-eight points in the two hands 

— Grand slam. 

That’s what the book said! Bar- 
bara girl, “three no trump” is 25, 
26, or 27 points — add thirteen and 
it reads “Grand Slam.” 

But was Mr. Farnham playing 
by the book? Or was he bidding a 
shut-out to grab the rubber and nail 
down that preposterous bet? 

If she passed, then game and 
rubber — and four hundred dollars 

— was certain. But grand slam (if 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



11 



they made it) was, uh, around fifteen 
dollars at the stakes Duke and his 
father were playing. Risk four hun* 
dred dollars of her partner’s money 
igainst a chance of fifteen? Ridicu- 
ous! 

(But her partner had said, “Play 
by the book.”) 

“Seven no trump,” she said firm- 

:y- 

Duke whistled. “Thanks, Barbara. 
We’re ganging up on you, Dad. 
Double.” 

“Pass.” 

“Pass,” Karen echoed. 

Barbara again counted her hand. 
That singleton king looked awfully 
naked. But . either the home 
earn had thirty-eight points — or 
;t didn’t. “Redouble.” 

Duke grinned. “Thanks, sweetie 
pie. Your lead. Karen.” 

M r, Farnham put down his hand 
and abruptly left the table, 
rlis son said, “Hey! Come back and 
:ake your medicine!” 

Mr. Farnham snapped on the tele- 
vision, moved on and switched on 
:he radio, changed its setting. “Red 
niert!” he snapped. “Somebody tell 
Joseph!” He ran out of the room. 

“Come back! You can’t duck this 
with that kind of stunt!” 

“Shut up, Duke!” Karen snapped. 
The television screen flickered 
!nto life: “ — closing down. Tune at 
once to your emergency station. 
Good luck, good-by, and God bless 
you alir 

As the screen went blank the radio 
-ut in: “ — not a drill. This is not 
a drill. Take shelter. Emergency 



personnel report to their stations. 
Do not go out on the street. If you 
have no shelter, stay in the best pro- 
tected room of your home. This is 
not a drill. Unidentified ballistic ob- 
jects have been radar-sighted by our 
early-warning screens and it must be 
assumed that they are missiles. Take 
shelter. Emergency personnel report 
to their — ” 

“He means it,” Karen said in 
an awed voice. “Duke, show Barb 
where to go. I’ll wake Joseph.” She 
ran out of the room. 

Duke said, “I don’t believe it.” 

“Duke, how do we get into the 
shelter?” 

“I’ll show you.” He stood up un- 
hurriedly, picked up the hands put 
each in a separate pocket. “Mine and 
Sis’s in my trousers, yours and Dad’s 
in my coat. Come on. Want your 
suitcase?” 

“No!” 

II 

D uke led her through the kitchen 
to basement stairs. Mr. Farn- 
ham was halfway down, his wife in 
his arms. She seemed asleep. Duke 
snapped out of his attitude. “Hold 
it, Dad! I’ll take her.” 

“Get on down and open the door!” 
The door was steel set into the 
wall of the basement. Seconds were 
lost because Duke did not know how 
to handle its latch. At last Mr. Farn- 
ham passed his wife over to his son, 
opened it himself. Beyond, stairs led 
farther down. They managed it by 
carrying Mrs. Farnham, hands and 
feet, a limp doll, and took her 



12 



IF 




through a second door into a room 
beyond. Its floor was six feet lower 
than the basement and under, Bar- 
bara decided, their back garden. She 
hung back while Mrs. Farnham was 
carried inside. 

Mr. Farnham reappeared. “Bar- 
bara! Get in here! Where’s Joseph? 
Where’s Karen?” 

Those two came rushing down 
the basement, stairs as he spoke. 
Karen was flushed and seemed ex- 
cited and happy. Joseph was look- 
ing wild-eyed and was dressed in 
undershirt and trousers, his feet 
bare. 

He stopped short. “Mr. Farnham! 
Are they going to hit us?” 

“I’m afraid so. Get inside.” 

The young Negro turned and yell- 
ed, ''Doctor Livingstone I presumed 
He dashed back up the stairs. 

Mr. Farnham said, “Oh, GodV* 
and pressed his fists against his 
temples. He added in his usual 
voice, “Get inside, girls. Karen, bolt 
the door but listen for me. I’ll wait 
as long as I can.” He glanced at 
his watch. “Five minutes.” 

The girls went in. Barbara whisp- 
ered, “What happened to Joseph? 
Flipped?” 

“Well, sort of. Dr.-Livingstone- 
1-Presume is our cat. Loves Joseph, 
tolerates us.” Karen started bolting 
the inner door, heavy steel, and 
secured with ten inch-thick bolts. 

She stopped. “Fm damned if I’ll 
bolt this all the way while Daddy 
is outside! 

“Don’t bolt it at all.” 

Karen shook her head. “I’ll use a 
couple, so he can hear me draw 



them. That cat may be a mile away.* 
Barbara looked around. It was an 
L-shaped room; they had entered the 
end of one arm. Two bunks were oa 
the righthand wall; Grace Farnham 
was in the lower and still asleep. 
The left wall was solid with packed 
shelves; the passage was hardly 
wider than the door. The ceiling was 
low and arched and bf corrugated 
steel. She could see the ends of two 
more bunks at the bend. Duke was 
not in sight but he quickly appeared 
from around the bend, started setting 
up a card table in the space there. 
She watched in amazement as he 
got out the cards he had picked up 
— how long ago? It seemed an hour. 
Probably less than five minutes. 

Duke saw her, grinned, and placed 
folding chairs around the table. 

T here came a clanging at the 
door. Karen unbolted it; Joseph 
tumbled in, followed by Mr. Fam- 
ham. A lordly red Persian cat jump- 
ed out of Joseph’s arms, started an 
inspection. Karen and her father 
bolted the door. He glanced at his 
wife, then said, “Joseph! Help me 
crank.” 

“Yes, sir!” 

Duke came over. “Got her nut- 
toned up, Skipper?” 

“All but the sliding door. It has 
to be cranked.” 

“Then come take your licking.” 
Duke waved at the table. 

His father stared. “Duke, are vou 
seriously proposing to finish a card 
game while we’re being attacked?” 
“I’m four hundred dollars sen- 
ous. And another hundred says we 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



13 




aren't being attacked. In a half hour 
they’ll call it off and tomorrow’s 
papers will say the northern lights 
fouled up the radar. Play the hand? 
Or default?” 

‘‘-Mmm. My partner will play it; 
I’m busy.” 

“You stand behind the way she 
plays it?” 

“Of course.” 

Barbara found herself sitting down 
at the table with a feeling that she 
had wandered into a dream. She 
picked up her partner’s hand, 
studied it. “Lead, Karen.” 

Karen said, “Oh, hell!” and led 
the trey of clubs. Duke picked up 
the dummy, laid it out in suits. 
“What do you want on it?” he ask- 
ed. 

“Doesn’t matter. I’ll play both 
hands face up.” 

“Better not.” 

“It’s solid.” She exposed the cards. 

Duke studied them. “I see,” he 
admitted. “Leave the hands; Dad 
will want to see this.” He did some 
figuring. “Call it twenty-four hun- 
dred points Dad!” 

“Yes, Son?” 

“I’m writing a check for four 
hundred and ninety-two dollars — 
and let that be a lesson to me.” 

“You don’t need to — ” 

All lights went out, the floor 
slammed against their feet. Barbara 
felt frightening pressure on her chest, 
tried to stand up and was knocked 
over. All around was a noise of 
giant subway trains, and the floor 
heaved like a ship in a cross sea. 

“Dad!” 

“Yes Duke! Are you hurt?” 



“I don’t know. But mako duH 
five hundred and mnoty-two dol- 
lars!” 

The subterranean rumbling weal 
on. Through this roar Barbara heard 
Mr. Farnham chuckle. “Forget it!" 
he called out. “The dollar just de- 
preciated.” 

Mrs. Farnham started to screanL 
“Hubert! Hubert, where are you? 
Hubert! Make it stop! Please make 
it stop!” 

“Coming, dear!” A pencil of light 
cut the blackness, moved toward 
the bunks near the door. Barbara 
raised her head, made out that it 
was her host, on hands and knees 
with a flashlight in his teeth. He 
reached the bunk, succeeded in 
quieting Grace; her screams ceased. 
“Karen?” 

“Yes, Daddy.” 

“Are you all right?” 

“Yes. Just bruised. My chair went

“All right. Get the emergency 
lighting on in this bay. Don’t stand 
up. Crawl, ril light you from here. 
Then get the hypo kit and — Ow!

“Yes, sir.” 

“You in one piece?” 

“I’m okay. Boss.”

“He’s just friendly, Mr. Farn-

“Yes, yes. But I don’t want him

Call him.” 

“Sure thing. Here, Doc! Doc, 
Doc, Doc! Fish, Doc!”

IF 




S ome minutes later the rumbling 
had died out, the floor was 
steady, Mrs. Farnham had been 
knocked out by injected drug, two 
tiny lights were glowing in the first 
bay, and Mr. Farnham was inspect- 
ing. 

Damage was slight. Despite guard 
rails, cans had popped off shelves; a 
fifth of rum was broken. But liquor 
was almost the only thing stored in 
glass. The worst casualty was the 
shelter’s battery-driven radio, torn 
loose from the wall and smashed. 

Mr. Farnham was on his knees, re- 
trieving bits of it. His son looked 
down. “Don’t bother. Dad. Sweep it 
up and throw it away.” 

“Some parts can be salvaged.” 
“What do you know about 
radios?” 

“Nothing,” his father admitted. 
“But I have books.” 

“A book won’t fix that. You 
should have stocked a spare.” 

“I have a spare.” 

“Then for God’s sake get it! I 
want to know what’s happened.” 

His father got up slowly and look- 
at Duke. “I would like to know, too. 
I can’t hear anything over this radio 
I’m wearing. Not surprising, it’s short 
range. But the spare is packed in 
foam and probably wasn’t hurt.” 
“Then- get it hooked up.” 
“Later.” 

“Later, hell. Where is it?” 

Mr. Farnham breathed hard. “I’ve 
had all the yap I’m going to take. 
Fm going to wait until I’m sure the 
attack is over. If you’re itching to 
know what’s happening outside, you 
can leave. If that’s what you want 



I’ll unbolt this door, crank back 
the armor door, and you can open 
the upper door yourself.” 

“Eh? Don’t be silly.” 

“But close it after you. I don’t 
want it open — both for blast and 
radioactivity.” 

“That’s another thing. Don’t you 
have any way to measure radio- 
activity? We ought take -steps to — ” 

''SHUT UPr 

“What? Dad, I don’t appreciate 
being bawled out in the presence of 
others.” 

“Then keep your voice down.” 
They were in the first bay near the 
door. Mrs. Farnham was snoring by 
them; the others had retreated 
around the bend, unwilling to wit- 
ness. “Are you ready to listen 
to me now?” 

“Very well, sir,” Duke said stiffly. 

“Good. Son, I was not joking. 
Either leave ... or do exactly as 1 
tell you. That includes keeping your 
mouth shut when I tell you to. 
Which will it be? Absolute obedi- 
ence, prompt and cheerful? Or will 
you leave?” 

“Aren’t you being rather high- 
handed?” 

“I intend to be. This shelter is 
a lifeboat and I am boat officer. 
For the safety of all I shall main- 
tain discipline. Even if it means 
tossing somebody, even my own son, 
overboard.” 

“That’s a far-fetched simile. Dad, 
it’s a shame you were in the Navy. 
It gives you romantic ideas.” 

“/ think it’s a shame, Duke, that 
you never had service. You’re not 
realistic. Well, which is it?”

“Uh, ril be cooperative. But 
tliis absolute dictatorship — Dad, 
tonight you made quite a point of 
the fact that you are a free man. 
Well, so am I. I’ll cooperate. But 
I won’t take unreasonable orders 
and, as for keeping my mouth shut, 
ril try to be diplomatic. But when I 
think it’s necessary, I’ll voice my 
opinion. Free speech. Fair enough?” 

H is father sighed. “Not nearly 
good enough, Duke. Stand 
aside. I want to unbolt the door.” 
“Don’t push a joke too far, Dad.” 
“I’m not joking. I’m putting you 
out.” 

“Dad ... I hate to say this . 
but I don’t think you are man 
enough. I’m bigger than you are 
and a lot younger.” 

“Duke, please! I built this shelter. 
Not two hours ago you were sneer- 
ing at it, telling me that it was a 
‘sick* thing to do. Now you want to 
use it, since it turned out you were 
wrong. Can’t you admit that?” 

“Oh, certainly. You’ve made your 
point.” 

“Yet you are telling me how to 
run it. Telling me that / should have 
provided a spare radio. When you 
hadn’t provided anything. Can’t you 
be a man, give in, and do as I 
tell you? When your life depends 
on my hospitality?” 

“Cripes! I told you I would co- 
operate.” 

“But you haven’t been doing so. 
You’ve been making silly remarks, 
getting in my way, giving me lip, 
wasting my time when I have urgent 
things to do. Duke, I don’t want 



your cooperation, on your termi^ 
according to your judgment. Whfli 
we are in this shelter I want yoor 
absolute obedience.” 

Duke shook his head. “Get M 
through your head that Fm no longer 
a child. Dad. My cooperation, yet. 
But I won’t promise the other.” 

Mr. Farnham shook his head sor- 
rowfully and turned away, “Josephl* 
“Yes, sir?” 

“It’s condition seven.” 

“Condition seven, sir?” 

“Yes, and getting worse. Be care- 
ful with the instruments and don*t 
waste time.” 

“Right away, sir!” 

“Thank you.” He turned to hii 
son. “Duke, if you really want to co- 
operate, you could pick up the pieces 
of this radio. It’s the same model 
as the one in reserve. There may be 
pieces we can use to repair the other 
one, if it becomes necessary. Will 
you do that?*' 

“Sure, sure. I told you I would 
cooperate.” Duke got on his knees, 
started to complete the task he had 
interrupted. 

“Thank you.” His father turned 
away. 

“Mr. Duke! Get your hands up I” 
Duke looked over his shoulder, 
saw Joseph by the card table, aiming 
a Thompson submachine gun at him. 
He jumped to his feet. “What tht 
hell!” 

“Stay there!” Joseph said. “I’ll 
shoot.” 

“Yes,” agreed Duke’s father, “he 
doesn’t have the compunctions you 
thought I had. Joseph, if he moves, 
shoot him.”

‘‘Daddy! What’s going on?” 

Mr. Farnham turned to face his 
daughter. “Get back!” 

“But, Daddy — ” 

“Shut up. Both of you get into 
that lower bunk. Karen on the in- 
side. Mover 

K aren moved. Barbara looked 
wide-eyed at the- automatic her 
host now held in his hand and got 
quickly into the lower bunk of the 
other bay. “Arms around each 
other,” he said briskly. “Don’t eith- 
er of you let the other one move.” 
He went back to the first bay. 
“Duke.” 

“Yes?” 

“Lower your hands slowly and un- 
fasten your trousers. Let them fall 
but don’t step out of them. Then 
turn slowly and face the door. Un- 
fasten the bolts.” 

“Dad — ” 

“Shut up. Joseph, if he does any- 
thing but exactly what I told him to, 
shoot. Try for his legs, but hit him.” 
Face white, expression dazed, 
Duke did as he was told: let his 
trousers fall until he was hobbled, 
turned and started unbolting the 
door. His father let him continue 
until half the bolts were drawn. 
“Duke. Stop. The next few seconds 
determine whether you go — or stay. 
You know the terms.” 

Duke barely hesitated. “I accept.” 
“I must elaborate. You will not 
only obey me, you will obey Joseph.” 
^Joseph?^^ 

“My second-in-command. I have 
to have one, Duke; I can’t stay 
awake all the time. I would gladly

have had you as deputy — but you 
would have nothing to do with it. 
So I trained Joseph. He knows where 
everything is, how it works, how to 
repair it. So he^s my deputy. Well? 
Will you obey him just as cheerfully? 
No back talk?” 

Duke said slowly, “I promise.” 

‘‘Good. But a promise made under 
duress isn’t binding. There is anoth- 
er commitment always given under 
duress and nevertheless binding, a 
point which as a lawyer you will ap- 
preoiate. I want your parole as a 
prisoner. Will you give me your 
parole to abide by the conditions 
until we leave the shelter? A straight 
quid-pro-quo; your parole in ex- 
change for not being forced out- 
side?” 

‘‘You have my parole.” 

“Thank you. Throw the bolts and 
fasten your trousers. Joseph, stow the 
Tommy gun.” 

“Okay, Boss.” 

Duke secured the door, secured 
his pants. As he turned around his 
father offered him the automatic, 
butt first. “What’s this for?” Duke 
asked. 

“Suit yourself. If your parole 
isn’t good, I would rather find it 
out now.” 

Duke took the gun, removed the 
clip, worked the slide and caught the 
cartridge from the chamber, put it 
back int6 the clip and reloaded the 
gun — handed it back. “My parole 
is good. Here.” 

“Keep it. You were always a 
headstrong boy, Duke, but you were 
never a Kar.” 

“Okay , , . Boss.” His son put 



the pistol in a pocket. “Hot in here.” 
“And going to get hotter.” 

“Eh? How much radiation do you 
think we’re getting?” 

“I don’t mean radiation. Fire 
storm.” He walked into the space 
where the bays joined, looked at a 
thermometer, then at his wrist 
“Eighty-four and only twenty-three 
minutes since we were hit. It’ll get 
worse.” 

“How much worse?” 

“How would I know, Duke? 1 
don’t know how far away the hit 
was, how many megatons, how wide- 
spread the fire. I don’t even know 
whether the house is burning over- 
head, or was blasted away. Normal 
temperature in here is about fifty 
degrees. That doesn’t look good. But 
there is nothing to do about it. Yes, 
there’s one thing. Strip down t0 
shorts. I shall.” 

H e went into the other bay. Tha 
girls were still in the lower 
bunk, arms around each other, keep- 
ing quiet. Joseph was on the floor 
with his back to the wall, the cat 
in his lap. Karen looked round-eyed 
as her father approached but she 
said nothing. 

“You kids can get up.” 
“Thanks,” said Karen. “Pretty 
warm for snuggling.” Barbara back- 
ed out and Karen sat up. 

“So it is. Did you hear what jmt 
happened?” 

“Some sort of argument,” Karen 
said cautiously. 

“Yes. And it’s the last one. I’m 
boss and Joseph is my deputy. Un- 
derstood?”

“Yes, Daddy, ”said Karen. 

“Mrs. Wells?” 

“Me? Why, of course! It’s your 
shelter. Pm grateful to be in it — 
Pm grateful to be alive! And please 
call me Barbara, Mr. Farnham.” 

“Sorry, Hmm. Call me ‘Hugh,* I 
prefer it to ‘Hubert.’ Duke, every- 
body — first names from now on. 
Don’t call me ‘Dad,’ call me ‘Hugh.' 
Joe, knock off the ‘Mister’ and the 
‘Miss.’ Catch?” 

“Okay, Boss, if you say so.” 

“Make that ‘Okay, Hugh.* Now 
you girls peel down, panties and bra 
or such, then get Grace peeled to 
her skin and turn the light out there. 
It’s hot, it’s going to get hotter. Joe, 
strip to your shorts.*' Mr. Farnham 
took his packet off, started unbutton- 
ing his shirt. 

Joseph said, “Uh, Pm comforta- 
ble.” 

“I wasn’t asking, I was telling 
you.” 

“Uh . Boss, Vm not wearing 
shorts!** 

“He’s not,” Karen confirmed. “I 
rushed him.” 

“So?” Hugh looked at his ex- 
houseboy and chuckled. “Joe, you’re 
a sissy. I should have made Karen 
straw boss.” 

“Suits me.” 

“Get a pair out of stores and you 
can change in the toilet space. While 
you’re about it, show Duke where 
it is. Karen, the same for Barbara. 
Then we’ll gather for a powwow.” 

The powwow started five minutes 
later. Hugh Farnham was at the 
table, dealing out bridge hands, as- 



sessing them. When they were seat^ 
ed he said, “Anybody for bridge?” 

“Daddy, you’re joking.” 

“My name is ‘Hugh.’ I was not 
joking, a rubber of bridge might 
quiet your nerves. Put away that 
cigarette, Duke.” 

“Uh . sorry.” 

“You can smoke tomorrow, 1 
think. Tonight I’ve got pure oxygen 
cracked pretty wide and we are tak- 
ing in no air. You saw the bottles 
in the toilet space?” The space be- 
tween the bays was filled by pres- 
sure bottles, a water tank, a camp 
toilet, stores, and a small area where 
a person might manage a stand-up 
bath. Air intakes and exhausts, cap- 
ped off, were there, plus a hand-or- 
power blower, and scavengers for 
carbon dioxide and water vapor. 
This space was reached by an arch- 
way between the tiers of bunks. 

“Oxygen in those? I thought it 
was air.” 

“Couldn’t afford the space penal- 
ty. So we can’t risk fire, even a 
cigarette. I opened one inlet for a 
check. Very hot — heat ‘hot’ as 
well as making a Geiger counter 
chatter. Folks, I don’t know how 
long we’ll be on bottled breathing.’ 
I figured thirty-six hours for four! 
people, so it’s nominally twenty-fourj 
hours for six, but that’s not the 
pinch. I’m sweating — and so are 
you. We can take it to about a 
hundred and twenty. Above that, 
we’ll have to use oxygen just to cool 
the place. It might end in a fine 
balance between heat and suffoca- 
tion. Or worse.”

going to be baked alive?’’ 

“You won't be, Karen. I won’t 
let you be.” 

“Well ... I prefer a bullet.” 
“Nor will you be shot. I have 
enough sleeping pills to let twenty 
people die painlessly. But we aren’t 
here to die. We’ve had vast luck; 
with a little more we’ll make it. 
So don’t be morbid.” 

4 4 T T ow about the radioactivity?” 
asked Hugh. 

“Can you read an integrating 
counter?” 

“No.” 

“Take my word for it that wc 
are in no danger yet. Now about 
sleeping. This side, where Grace is, 
is the girls’ dorm; this other side 
is ours Only four bunks but that’s 
okay; one person has to monitor air 
and heat, and the other one without 
a bed can keep him awake. How- 
ever I’m taking the watch tonight 
and won’t need company; I’ve taken 
dexedrine.” 

“I’ll stand watch.” — “I’ll stay up 
with you.” — “I’m not sleepy let 
me stay here — ” 

“Slow down!” Hugh said. “Joe, 
you can’t stand watch now because 
you have to relieve me when I’m 
tuckered out. You and I will alter- 
nate until we‘ are sure Aat the situ- 
ation is safe.” 

Joe shrugged and kept quiet. Duke 
said, “Then it’s my privilege.” 

“Can’t either of you add? Two 
bunks for women, two for men. 
What’s left over? We’ll fold this 
table and the gal left over can sprawl 



on the floor here. Joe, break out 
blankets and put a couple here and 
a couple in the tank space for me.’* 
“Right away, Hugh!” 

Both girls insisted on standing 
watch. Hugh shut them off. “Cut 
for it.” 

“But — ” 

“Pipe down, Barbara. Ace low, 
and low girl sleeps on a bunk, the 
other here on the floor. Duke, do you 
want a sleeping pill?” 

“That’s one habit I don’t have.” 
“Don’t be an iron man.” 

“Well — A rain check?” 

“Surely. Joe? Seconal?” 

“Well, I’m so relieved that I don’t 
have to take that quiz tomor- 
row . .” 

“Glad somebody is happy. All 
right.” 

“I was going to add that I’m pret- 
ty keyed up. You’re sure you won’t 
need me?” 

“I’m sure. Karen, get one for Joe. 
You know where?” 

“Yes and I’m going to get one for 
me, since I won the cut. I’m no iron 
man! And a Miltown on top of it.” 
“Do that. Sorry, Barbara, you 
can’t have one; I might have to wake 
you and have you keep me awake. 
You can have Miltown. You’ll prob- 
ably sleep from it.” 

“I don’t need it.” 

“As you wish. Bed, everybody. 
It’s midnight and two of you are go- 
ing on watch in eight hours.” 

In a few minutes all were in bed 
with Barbara where the table had 
been, all lights out save one in the 
tank space. Hugh squatted on blan- 
kets there, playing solitaire — badly.

. r 4 gain the floor heaved, again 
came that terrifying rumble. Kar- 
en screamed. 

Hugh was up at once. This one 
was not as violent; he was able to 
•tay on his feet. He hurried into the 
girls’ dorm. ‘‘Baby! Where are you?" 
He fumbled, found the light switch. 

“Up here, Daddy. Oh, Fm scared! 
I was just dropping off and it al- 
most threw me out. Help me down." 

He did so; she clung to him, sob- 
bing. “There, there,” he said, pat- 
ting her. “You’ve been a brave girl, 
don’t let it throw you.” 

“I’m not brave. Fve been scared 
silly all along. I just didn’t want it 
to show.” 

“Well . Fm scared too. So let’s 
not show it, huh? Better have an- 
other pill. And a stiff drink.” 

“All right. Both. Fm not going to 
sleep in that bunk. It’s too hot up 
there, as well as scary when it 
shakes.” 

“All right. I’ll pull the mattress 
down.” 

Duke and Barbara were sitting 
on the blanket she had been nap- 
ping on ; they were looking very 
solemn. Hugh said, “Where’s Joe? 
He wasn’t hurt, was he?” 

Duke gave a short laugh. “Want 
to see ‘Sleeping Innocence’? That 
bottom bunk.” 

Hugh found his second-in-com- 
mand sprawled on his back, snoring, 
as deeply unconscious as Grace 
Far oh am . Dr . -Livingstone-I-Presume 
was curled up on his chest. Hugh 
came back. “Well, that blast was 
farther away. Fm glad Joe could 
deep.” 



“It was too damned close to suit 
me! When are they going to run out 
of those things?” 

“Soon, I hope. Folks, Karen and 
I have just formed the ‘Fm-scared- 
too’ club and are about to celebrate 
with a drink. Any* candidates?” 

“Fm a charter member!” 

“So am I,” agreed Barbara. “Yes!" 
Hugh fetched papef cups, and 
bottles — Scotch, seconal, and Mil- 
town. “Water, anyone?” 

Duke said, “I don’t want anything 
interfering with the liquor.” 

“Water, please,” Barbara an- 
swered. “It’s so hot.” 

“How hot is it, Daddy?” 

“Duke, I put the thermometer in 
the tank room. Go see, will you?” 
“Sure. And may I use that rain 
check?” 

“Certainly.” Hugh gave Karen an- 
other seconal capsule, another Mil- 
town pill, and told Barbara that she 
must take a Miltown — then took 
one himself, having decided that dex- 
edrine had made him edgy. Duke re- 
turned. 

“One hundred and four degrees,” 
he announced. “I opened the valve 
another quarter turn. All right?” 
“Have to open it still wider soon. 
Here are your pills, Duke.” 

“Thanks.” Duke swallowed them, 
chased them with whisky. “Fm go- 
ing to sleep on the floor, too. Coolest 
place in the house.” 

“Smart of you. All right, leFs 
settle down. Give the pills a chance." 

H ugh sat with Karen after she 
bedded down, then gently ex- 
tracted his hand from hers and re-

turned to the tank room. The tem- 
perature was up two degrees. He 
opened the valve on the working 
tank still wider, listened to it sigh 
to emptiness, shook his head, got a 
wrench and shifted the gauge to a 
full tank. Before he opened it, he 
attached a hose, led it out into the 
main room. Then he went back to 
pretending to play solitaire. 

A few minutes later Barbara ap- 
peared in the doorway. “Fm not 
sleepy,” she said. ‘‘Could you use 
some company?” 

“You’ve been crying.” 

“Does it show? Fm sorry.” 
“Come sit down. Want to play 
cards?” 

“If you want to. All I want is 
company.” 

“We’ll talk. Would you like an- 
other drink?” 

“Oh, would I! Can you spare it?” 
“I stocked plenty. Barbara, can 
you think of a better night to have 
a drink? But both of us will have 
to see to it that the other one doesn’t 
go to sleep.” 

“All right. I’ll keep you awake.” 
They shared a cup, Scotch with 
water from the tank. It poured out as 
sweat faster than they drank it. Hugh 
increased the gas flow again and 
found that the ceiling was unpleas- 
antly hot. “Barbara, the house must 
have burned over us. There is 
thirty inches of concrete above us 
and then two feet of dirt.” 

“How hot do you suppose it is 
outside?” 

“Couldn’t guess. We must have 
been close to the fireball.” He felt 
the ceiling again. “I beefed this thing 



up — roof, walls, and floor are all 
one steel-reinforced box. It was none 
too much. We may have trouble get- 
ting the doors open. All this heat — 
And probably warped by concus- 
sion.” 

She said quietly, “Are we 
trapped?” 

“No, no. Under these bottles is 
a hatch to a tunnel. Thirty-inch cul- 
vert with concrete around it. Leads 
to the gully back of the garden. We 
can break out — crowbars and a 
hydraulic jack — even if the end is 
crushed in and covered with crater 
glass. Fm not worried about that; 
I’m worried about how long we can 
stay inside . and whether it will 
be safe when we leave.” 

“How bad is the radioactivity?” 

He hesitated. “Barbara, would it 
mean anything to you? Know any- 
thing about radiation?” 

“Enough. Fm majoring — I was 
majoring — in botany; I’ve used 
isotopes in genetics experiments. I 
can stand bad news, Hugh, but not 
knowing — well, that’s why I was 
crying.” 

“Mmm. The situation is worse 
than I told Duke.” He jerked his 
thumb over his shoulder. “Integrat- 
ing counter back of the bottles. Go 
look.” 

She went to it, stayed several min- 
utes. When she came back, she sat 
down without speaking. “Well?” he 
asked. 

“Could I have another drink?” 

“Certainly.” He mixed it. 

She sipped it, then said quietly, 
“If the slope doesn’t change, we’ll 
hit the red line by morning.” she

frowned. *^But that marks a con- 
servative limit. If I remember the 
figures, we probably won’t start 
vomiting for at least another day.” 

And the curve should 
I level off soon. That’s why 
heat worries me more than radia- 
tion.” He looked at the thermom- 
eter, cracked the valve still wider. 
“I’ve been running the water-vapor 
getter on battery; I don’t think we 
should crank the blower in this heat. 
I’m not going to worry about Cee- 
Oh-Two until we start to pant.” 
“Seems reasonable.” 

“Let’s forget the hazards. Any- 
tiling you’d like to talk about? Your- 
self?” 

“Little to tell, Hugh. Female, 
white, twenty-five years old. Back in 
school, or was, after a bad marriage. 
A brother in the Air Force — so pos- 
sibly he’s all right. My parents were 
in Acapulco, so perhaps they are, 
too. No pets, thank God — and I 
was so pleased that Joe saved his 
cat. No regrets, Hugh, and not 
afraid . not really. Just . sad.” 
She sniffed. “It was a pretty nice 
world, even if 1 did crumb up my 
marriage.” 

“Don’t cry.” 

“I’m not crying; Those drops are 
sweat.” 

“Yes. Surely.” 

“They are. It’s terribly hot.” Sud- 
denly she reached both hands be- 
hind her ribs. “Do you mind? If I 
take this off? It’s smothering me.” 
“Go ahead. Child, if you can get 
comfortable — or less uncomfort- 
able — do so. Skin doesn’t shock 



me.” He stood up, went behind the 
oxygen bottles, and looked at the 
record of radiation. Having done 
so, he checked the thermometer and 
increased the flow of oxygen. 

As he sat down he remarked, “I 
might as well have stored air instead 
of oxygen, then we could smoke. 
But I did not expect to use it for 
cooling.” He ignored .the fact that 
she had accepted his invitation to 
be comfortable. He added, “I was 
worried about heating the place. I 
tried to design a stove to use con- 
taminated air safely. Possible. But 
difficult.” 

“I think you did amazingly well. 
This is the only shelter I’ve ever 
heard of with stored air. You’re a 
scientist. Aren’t you?” 

“Me? Heavens, no. High school 
only. What little I know I picked 
up here and there. Some in the 
Navy, metal work and correspond- 
ence courses. Then I worked for a 
public futility and learned something 
about construction and pipe lines. 
Then I became a contractor.” He 
smiled. “No Barbara, I’m a ‘general 
specialist’. The Elephant ChilcPs 
’satiable curiosity.’ Like Dr.-Living- 
stone-I-Presume.” 

“How did a cat get a name like 
that?” 

“Karen. Because he’s a great ex- 
plorer. That cat can get into any- 
thing. Do you like cats?” 

“I don’t know much about them.

“So he is but I like all cats. You 
don’t own a cat, he is a free citizen. 
Take dogs; dogs are friendly and fun 
and loyal. But slaves. Not their

fault, they’ve been bred for it. But 
slavery makes me queasy, even in 
animals.” 

He frowned. “Barbara, I’m not as 
sad over what has happened as you 
are. It might be good for us. I don’t 
mean us six; I mean our country.” 

S he looked very startled. “How?” 
“Well — It’s hard to take the 
long view when you are crouching 
m a shelter and wondering how long 
you can hold out. But — Barbara, 
I’ve wonied for years about our 
country. It seems to me that we have 
been breeding slaves — and I believe 
in freedom. This war may have turn- 
ed the tide. This may be the first 
war in history which kills the stupid 
rather than the bright and able — 
where is makes any distinction.” 
“How do you figure that, Hugh?” 
“Well, wars have always been 
hardest on the best young men. This 
time the boys in service are as safe 
or safer than civilians. And of civ- 
ilians those who used their heads 
and made preparations stand a far 
better chance. Not every case, but 
on the average, and that will im- 
prove the breed. When it’s over, 
things will be tough, and that wifl 
improve the breed still more. For 
years the surest way of surviving 
has been to be utterly worthless and 
breed a lot of worthless kids. All 
standard genetics. But it seems 
that will change.” 

She nodded. “That’s cruel.” 

“It is cruel. But no government 
yet has been able to repeal natural 
laws, though they keep trying.” 

She shivered in spite of the heat. 
“1 suppose you’re right. No, 1 know 



you’re right. But I could face it more 
cheerfully if I thought there was go- 
ing to be any country left. Killing 
the poorest third is good genetics 
. but there is nothing good about 
killing them all.” 

“Mmm, yes. I hate to think about 
it. But I did think about it. Barbara, 
I didn’t stockpile oxygen just against 
radiation and fire storm. I had in 
mind worse things.” 

“Worse? How?” 

“All the talk about the horrors 
of World War Three has been about 
atomic weapons — fallout, hun- 
dred megaton bombs, neutron 
bombs. The disarmament talks and 
the pacifist parades have all been 
about the Bomb, the Bomb, the 
Bomb — as if A-weapons were the 
only thing that could kill. This may 
not be just an A-weapon war; more 

likely it is an ABC war atomic, 

biological, and chemical.” He hooked 
a thumb at the tanks. “That’s why I 
stocked that bottled breathing. 
Against nerve gas. Aerosols. Viruses. 
God knows what. The communists 
won’t smash this country if they 
can kill us without destroying our 
wealth. I wouldn’t be surprised to 
learn that bombs had been used only 
OQ military targets like the anti- 
missile base here, but that New York 
and Detroit and such received nerve 
gas. Or a 24-hour plague with 80% 
mortality. The horrid possibilities 
are endless. The air outside could be 
loaded with death that a counter 
won’t detect and a filter can’t stop.” 
He smiled grimly. “Sorry. You had 
better go back to bed.” 

“I’m miserable anyway and don’t 
Wiot to be alone. May 1 stay?”

IF 




“Certainly. I’m happier with you 
present no matter how gloomy I 
sound.” 

“What you’ve been saying isn’t 
nearly as gloomy as the thoughts I 
have alone. I wish we knew what 
was going on outside!” She added, 
“I wish we had a periscope.” 

“We do have,” 

“Huh? WhereT 

“Did have. Sorry. That pipe over 
there. I tried to raise it but it won’t 
budge. However — Barbie, I tromped 
on Duke for demanding that I break 
out our spare radio before the at- 
tack was over. But maybe it’s over. 
What do you think?” 

“Me? How would I know?” 
“You know as much as I do. That 
first missile was intended to take out 
the MAMMA base; they wouldn’t 
bother with us otherwise. If they 
are spotting from orbiting space- 
ships, then that second one was an- 
other try at the same target. The 
timing fits, time of flight from Kam- 
chatka is about half an hour and the 
second hit about forty-five minutes 
after the first. That one was prob- 
ably a bull’s-eye — and they know 
it, because more than an hour has 
passed and no third missile. That 
means they are through with us; 
Logical?” ■ 

“Sounds logical to me.” 

“It’s crumby logic, my dear. Not 
enough data. Perhaps both missiles 
failed to knock out MAMMA, and 
MAMMA is now knocking out any- 
thing they throw. Perhaps the Rus- 
skis have run out of missiles. Per- 
haps the third round will be deliv- 
ered by bomber. We don’t know. 
But Fm itching to find out.” 



44T would certainly like to hear 
A some news.” 

“We’ll try. If it’s good news, we’ll 
wake the others.” Hugh Farnham 
dug into the corner, came out with 
a box, unpacked a radio. “Doesn’t 
have a scratch. Let’s try it without 
an antenna. 

“Nothing but static,” he announ- 
ced shortly. “Not surprised. Al- 
though its mate could pull in local 
stations without an aerial. Now 
we’ll hook to the fixed antenna. 
Wait here.” 

He returned shortly. “No soap. 
Stands to reason that there isn’t any- 
thing left of the fixed antenna. ^ 
we’ll try the emergency one.” 

Hugh took a wrench and removed 
a cap from an inch pipe that stuck 
down through the ceiling. He tested 
the opening with a radiation counter. 
“A little more count.” He got two 
steel rods, each five feet long; with 
one he probed the pipe. “Doesn’t 
go up as far as it should. The tc\p 
of this pipe was buried just below 
ground. Trouble.” He screwed the 
second rod into the first. 

“Now comes the touchy part. 
Stand back, there may be debris — 
hot both ways — spilling down.” 
“It’ll get on you.” 

“On my hands, maybe. I’ll scrub 
afterwards. You can go over me with 
a Geiger counter.” He tapped with a 
sledge on the bottom of the joined 
rods. Up they went about eighteen 
inches. “Something solid. I’ll have 
to bang it.” 

Many blows later the rod was 
seated into the pipe. “It felt,” he 
said, as he stopped to scrub his 
hands, “as if we passed into open

air the last foot or so. But it should 
have stuck out five feet above 
ground. Rubble, I suppose. What’s 
left of our home. Want to use the 
counter on me?” 

“Hugh, you say that as casually 
as ‘What’s left of yesterday’s milk.’ ” 
He shrugged. “Barbie girl, I was 
broke when 1 joined the Navy, Pve 
been flat busted since; I will not 
waste tears over a roof and some 
plumbing. Get any count?” 

“You’re clean.” 

“Check the floor under the pipe.” 
There were hot spots on the floor; 
Hugh wiped them with damp 
Kleenex, disposed of it in a metal 
waste can. She checked his hands 
afterwards, and the spots on the 
floor. 

“Well, that used up a gallon of 
water; this radio had better work.” 
He clipped the antenna lead to the 
rod, switched it on. 

Ten minutes later they admitted 
fliat they were getting nothing. 
Noise — static all over the dial — 
but no signal. He sighed. “I’m not 
surprised. I don’t know what ioniza- 
tion does to radio waves, but that 
must be a sorcerer’s brew of hot 
botopes over our heads: I had hoped 
wc could get Salt Lake City.” 

“Not Denver?” 

“No. Denver had an ICBM base. 
rH leave the gain up; maybe we’ll 
bear something.^’ 

“Don’t you want to save the bat- 
tery?” 

“Not really. Let’s sit down and re- 
cite limericks.” He looked at the 
Integrating counter, whistled softly 
then checked the thermometer. “I’ll 
five our sleeping beauties a little 



more relief from the beat. How well 
are you standing it. Barbie?” 

“Truthfully, I had forgotten it. 
The sweat pours off and that’s that.” 
“Me, too.” 

“Well, don’t use more oxygen on 
my account. How many bottles are 
left?” 

“Not many.” 

“How many?” 

“Less than half. Don’t fret. I’ll 
bet you five hundred thousand dol- 
lars — fifty cents in the new cur- 
rency — that you can’t recite a lim- 
erick I don’t know.” 

“Clean, or dirty?” 

“Are there clean ones?” 

“Okay. ‘A playful young fellow 
named Scott — ’ ” 

T he limerick session was a flop. 

Hugh accused her of having a 
clean mind. She answered, “Not 
really, Hugh. But my mind isn’t 
working.” 

“I’m not at my sharpest. Another 
drink?” 

“Yes. With water, please, I sweat 
so; I’m dry. Hugh?” 

“Yes, Barbie?” 

“We’re going to die. Aren’t we?” 
“Yes.” 

“I thought so. Before morning?” 
“Oh, no! I feel sure we can live 
till noon. If we want to.” 

“I see. Hugh, would you mind if 
I moved over by you? Would you 
put your arm around me? Or is it 
too hot?” 

“Any time I’m too hot to put my 
arm around a girl I’ll know I’m 
dead and in hell.” 

“Thanks.” 

“Room enough?**

**Plenty,” said Barbara, smiling. 
“You’re a little girl.” 

“I weigh a hundred and thirty- 
two pounds and I’m five feet eight 
and that’s not little.” 

“You’re a little girl. Put the cup 
aside. Tilt your face up.” 

“Mmmm — Again. Please, again.” 
“A greedy little girl.” 

“Yes. Very greedy. Thank you, 
Hugh.” 

“All right?” 

“Wonderfully all right. And kiss 
me, too. Please?” 

“Barbara, Barbara!” 

“Hugh darling! I love you. Oh!” 
“I love you, Barbara.” 

“Yes. Yes! Oh, please! NowV* 
Some minutes later, the biggest 
slam of all hit them. 

Ill 

T he light went out, Grace Farn- 
ham screamed, and Dr. Livings- 
tone-I-Presume wailed. Barbara was 
knocked silly and came to heaped 
over a steel bottle and disoriented 
by blackne.ss and no floors or walls. 

She groped around, found a leg, 
found Hugh attached to it. He was 
limp. She felt for his heart beat, 
could not find’ it. 

She shouted: “Hello! Hello! Any- 
body!” 

Duke answered,- “Barbara?” 

“Yes, yes!” 

“Are you all right?” 

“I’m all right, Hugh is hurt. I 
think he’s dead.” 

“Take it easy. When I find my 
trousers. I’ll light a match — if I can 
get off my shoulders. I’m standing 
on them.” 



“Hubert! Hubertr 
“Yes, Mother! Wait.” Grace con- 
tinued to scream; Duke alternated 
reassurances and cursing the dark- 
ness. Barbara felt around, slipped on 
loose oxygen bottles, hurt her shiii« 
and found a flat surface. She could 
not tell what it was; it was canted 
steeply. 

Duke called out, “Got ’em!” A 
match flared up, torch bright in oxy- 
gen-rich air. 

Joe’s voice said, “Better put that 
out. Fire hazard.” A flashlight beam 
cut the gloom. 

Barbara called out, “Joe! Help me 
with Hugh!” 

“Got to see about lights.” 

“He may be dying.” 

“Can’t do a thing without light.” 
Barbara shut up, tried again to find 
heart beat — found it and clutched 
Hugh’s head, sobbing. 

Lights came on in the men’s bay; 
enough trickled in that Barbara 
could make out her surroundings. 
The floor sloped about thirty de- 
grees; she, Hugh, steel bottles, water 
tank, and other gear were jumbled 
in the lower corner. The tank had 
sprung a leak and was flooding the 
toilet space. She saw that, had the 
tilt been the other way, she and 
Hugh would have been buried under 
steel and water. 

Minutes later Duke and Joe 
joined her, letting themselves down 
through the door. Joe carried a 
camp lamp. Duke said to Joe, “How 
are we going to move him?” 

“We don’t. It might be his spine.” 
“Still have to move him.” 

“We don’t move him,” Joe said 
firmly. “Barbara, have you moved 
him?” 



FARMUAM'S FREEHOLD

“I took his head in my lap.” 
“Well, don’t move him any more.” 
Joe looked his patient over, touch- 
ing him gently. “I can’t see any gross 
injuries,” he decided. “Barbara, if 
you can stay put, we’ll wait until he 
comes to. Then I can check his eyes 
for concussion, see if he can wiggle 
his toes, things like that.” 

“I’ll hold still. Anybody else hurt?” 
“Not to speak of,” Duke assured 
her. “Joe thinks he’s cracked some 
ribs and I wrenched a shoulder. 
Mother just got rolled into the cor- 
ner of her bunk. Sis is soothing her. 
Sis is okay — a lump on her head 
where a can konked her. Are you 
all right?” 

“Just bruises. Hugh and I were 
playing double solitaire and trying to 
keep cool when it hit.” She wondered 
how long the lie would stand up. 
Duke had no more on than she did 
and didn’t seem troubled by it; Joe 
was dressed in underwear shorts. 
She added, “The cat? Is he all right?” 
“Dr.-Livingstone-I-Presume,” Joe 
answered seriously, “escaped injury. 
But he is vexed that his sand box was 
dumped over. He’s cleaning himself 
and criticizing.” 

“Fm.^lad he wasn’t hurt.” 

“Nofice anything about this 
blast?” 

“What, Joe? It was the hardest of 
the three. Much the hardest.” 

“Yes. But no rumbling. Just one 
great, big, grand slam, then . noth- 
ing.”. 

“What does that indicate?” 

“I don’t know. Barbara, can you 
stay here and not move? I want to 
get more lights on, check the dam- 
age, and see what to do about it.” 
“I won’t move.” Hugh seemed to 



be breathing easily. In the silenoi 
she could hear his heart beat. She 
had nothing to be unhappy about 

K aren joined her, carrying a 
flashlight and moving careful- 
ly on the slant. “How’s Daddy?” 
“No change.” 

“Knocked cold, I guess. So was I. 
You okay?” She played the flash 
light over Barbara. 

“Not hurt.” 

“Well! I’m glad you’re in uniform, 
too. I can’t find my pants. Joe ig- 
nores it so carefully, it’s painful. Is 
that boy square!” 

“I don’t know where my clothes 
are.” 

“Joe has the only pants among us. 
What happened to you? Were you 
asleep?” 

“No. I was here. We were talk- 
ing.” 

“Hmn — Further deponent say- 
eth not. I’ll keep your grisly secret. 
Mother won’t know; I gave her an- 
other hypo.” 

“Aren’t you jumping at conclu- 
sions?” 

“My favorite exercise. I hope 
my nasty suspicions are correct. I 
wish I had had something better to 
do than sleep last night. Since it’s 
probably our last night.” She leaned 
over and kissed Barbara. “I like 
you.” 

“Thanks, Karen. Me, too. You.” 
Let’s hold a funeral and preach 
about what nice guys we are. You 
made my Daddy happy when you 
had the guts to bid that slam. If you 
made him happier still, I’m in favor 
of it.” She straightened up. “ ’Bye. 
I’ll go sort groceries. If Daddy 
wakes up, yell.” She left.

“Barbara,” said Hugh softly. 
“Yes, Hugh? Yes!” 

“Keep your voice down. I heard 
what my daughter said.” 

“You did?” 

“Yes. She’s a gentleman. Barbara 
I love you. I may not have another 
chance to say so.” 

“I love you.” 

“Darling.” 

“Shall I call the others? 

“Shortly. Are you comfortable?” 
“Oh, very!” 

“Then let me rest a bit. I feel 
woozy.” 

“As long as you like. Uh, can you 
wiggle your toes? Do you hurt any 
place?” 

“I hurt lots of places, but not too 
much. Let me see — Yes, 1 can 
move everything. All right, call Joe.” 
“No hurry.” 

“Better call him. Work to do.” 
Shortly Mr. Farnham was back in 
charge. Joe required him to move 
himself — a mass of bruises but no 
break, sprain, nor concussion. It 
seemed to Barbara that Hugh had 
landed on the bottles and that she 
had landed on him. She did not dis- 
cuss her theory. 

Hugh’s first act was to bind Joe’s 
ribs with elastic bandage. Joe gasped 
as it tightened but seemed more 
comfortable with it. The lump on 
Karen’s head was inspected; Hugh 
decided that there was something he 
could do for it. 

“Will somebody fetch the ther- 
mometer?” he asked. “Duke?” 

“It’s busted.” 

“It’s a bimetal job. Shockproof.” 
“I looked for it,” Duke explained, 
“while you were doctoring. Seems 
cooler to me. While it may be shock- 



proof, it couldn’t stand being mashed 
between two tanks:” 

“Oh. Well, it’s no big loss.” 
“Dad? Wouldn’t this be a good 
time to try the spare radio?” 

“I suppose so, but — I hate to tell 
you, Duke, but you’ll probably find 
it smashed, too. We tried it earlier. 
No results.” He glanced at his wrist. 
“An hour and a half ago. At two 
a.m. Has anyone else the time?” 
Duke’s watch agreed. 

“We seem to be in fair shape,” 
Hugh decided, “except for water. 
There are some plastic jugs of water 
but we need to salvage the tank wa- 
ter; we may have to drink it. With 
Halazone tablets. Joe, we need uten- 
sils of any sort, and everybody bail. 
Keep it as clean as you can.” He 
added. “When Joe can spare you, 
Karen, scrounge some breakfast. 
We’ve got to eat, even if this is 
Armageddon.” 

“And Armageddon sick of it,” 
Karen offered. 

H er father winced. “Baby girl, 
you will write on the black- 
board one thousand times: T will not 
make bad puns before breakfast. ’ ” 
“I thought it was pretty good, 
Hugh.” 

“Don’t encourage her, Barbara. 
All right, get with it.” 

Karen returned shortly, carrying 
Dr. Livingstone. “I wasn’t much 
help,” she announced, “Because 
somebody has to hang onto this 
damn cat. He wants to help.”

“You did so! Fm going to entice

“Yes. That sounds very good.” 
“What you’ll get k Spam and 
crackers.” 

“All right. How’s the bailing go- 
ing?” 

“Daddy, I won’t drink that water 
even with Halazone.” She made a 
face. “You know where it wound 
•p. 

“We may have to drink it.” 
“Well ... if you cut it with whis- 
ky — ” 

“Mmm. Every case of liquor is 
leaking. The two I’ve opened each 
have one fifth, unbroken.” 

“Daddy, you’ve ruined breakfast.” 
“The question is, do I ration it 
evenly? Or save it all for Grace?” 
“Oh.” Karen’s features screwed up 
m painful decision. “She can have 
my share. But the others shouldn’t 
be deprived just because Gracie has 
a yen.” 

“Karen, at this stage it’s not a yen. 
ki a way, for her it’s medicine.” 
“Yeah, sure. And diamond brace- 
lets and sable coats are medicine for 

me. 

“Baby, there’s no point in blam- 
ing her. When you get to be my 

age — ” 

“Daddy, I don’t expect to get to 
be your age — and we both know it. 
If we’ve got even two fifths of li- 
quor, it’s probably enough. Why 
don’t you just serve it to whoever 
needs it?” 

The lines in his face got deeper. 
“Karen, I haven’t given up. It’s dis- 
tinctly cooler. We may get out of 
this yet.” 

“Well — I guess that’s the proper 
attitude. Give me a kiss, Daddy.” 

He did. “Now pipe down and get 
to work.” 



F ive of diem gathered for 
breakfast, sitting on the floor 
as chairs would not stand up. Mii. 
Famham was still lethargic frmn 
heavy sedation. The others shared 
canned meat, crackers, cold Nes- 
cafe, canned peaches and warm 
comradeship. They were dressed, the 
men in shorts, Karen in shorts and 
halter, and Barbara in a muu muu 
belonging to Karen. Her underwear 
had been salvaged but was soaked 
and the air was too moist to dry it 
Hugh announced. “Time for a 
conference. Suggestions are wd- 
come.” He looked at his son. 

“One item, Dad — Hugh,” Duke 
answered. “The backhouse took a 
beating. I patched it and rigged a 
platform out of boards that had se- 
cured the air bottles. It’s shaky.” 
“Good job, Duke. But with six of 
us I think we should rig a second 
one. Can we manage that, Joe?” 
“Yes, we could. But . .” 

“But what?” 

“Do you know how much oxy is 
left?” 

“I do. We must shift to blower 
and filter soon. And there is not a 
working radiation counter left. So 
we won’t know what we’ll be letting 
in. However we’ve got to breathe.” 
“But did you look at the blow- 
er?” 

“It looked all right.” 

“It’s not. I don’t think I can re- 
pair it.” 

Mr. Farnham sighed. “I’ve had a 
spare on order for six months. Well, 
rU look at it, too. And you, Duke; 
maybe one of us can fix it.” 
“Okay.” 

“Let’s assume we can’t repair it 
Then we use the oxygen as sparing-

ly as possible. After that we can get 
along, for a while, on the air inside. 
But there will come a time when we 
have to open the door.” 

Nobody said anything. “Smile, 
Bomebody!” Hugh went on. “We 
aren’t licked. We’ll rig dust filters out 
of sheets in the door — better than 
nothing. We still have one radio — 
the one you mistook for a hearing 
aid, Barbara. I wrapped it and put 
it away; it wasn’t hurt. Til go outside 
and put up an antenna and we can 
listen to it down here; it could save 
us. We’ll rig a flagpole, from the 
sides of a bunk perhaps, and fly a 
flag. A hunting shirt. No, the Amer- 
ican flag; I’ve got one. If we don’t 
make it, we’ll go down with our 
colors flying!” 

Karen started clapping. “Don’t 
scoff, Karen.” 

“I’m not scoffing. Daddy! I’m cry 
ing. The rockets red glare — the 
bombs bursting in air — gave proof 
through the night — that our flag 
was still — ’ ” Her voice broke and 
she buried her face in her hands. 

B arbara put an arm around 
her. Hugh Farnham went on 
as if nothing had happened. “But we 
won’t go down. Soon they will 
search this area for survivors. 
They’ll see our flag and take us 
out — helicopter, probably. 

“So our business is to be alive 
when they come.” He stopped to 
think. “No unnecessary work, no ex- 
ercise. Sleeping pills for everybody 
and try to sleep twelve hours a day 
and lie down all the time; it will 
make the air last as long as possible. 
The only work is to repair that blow- 
er and we’ll knock that off if we 



can’t fix it. Let’s see — Water must 
be rationed. Duke, you are water 
marshal. See how much pure water 
there is; work out a schedule to 
stretch it. There is a one ounce glass 
with the medicines; use it to dispense 
water. That’s all, I guess: Repair the 
blower, minimum exercise, max- 
imum sleep, rationed water, Oh, yes! 
Sweat is wasteful. It’s still hot and 
Barbara, you’ve sweat right through 
that sack. Take it off.” 

“May I leave the room?” 
“Certainly.” She left, walking care- 
fully on the steep floor, went into 
the tank room, and returned wear- 
ing her soaked underwear. “That’s 
better,” he approved. “Now — ” 
“Hubert! Hubert! Where are you? 
I’m thirsty.” 

“Duke, give her one ounce. 
Charge it to her.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Don’t forget that the cat has to 
have water. 

“The dirty water, maybe?” 
“Humm. We won’t die through 
playing fair with our guest. Let’s 
keep our pride.” 

“He's been drinking the dirty wa- 
ter.” 

“Well — You boss it. Sugges- 
tions, anyone? Joe does it suit you?” 
“Well — No, sir.” 

“So?” 

“No exercise, least oxygen used, 
makes sense. But when it comes 
time to open the door, where are 
we?” 

“We take our chances.” 

“I mean, can we? Short on air, 
panting, thirsty, maybe sick — I’d 
like to be certain that anyone, Kar- 
en, say, with a broken arm, can get 
that door open.”

“I see,” said Hugh, nodding. 

“I’d like to try all three doors. Fd 
like to leave the armor door open. 
A girl can’t handle that crank. I vol- 
unteer to try the upper door.” 

“Sorry, it’s my privilege. I go 
along with the rest. That’s why I 
asked for suggestions. I’m tired, Joe; 
my mind is fuzzy.” 

“And if the doors are blocked? 
Probably rubble against the upper 
door — ” 

“We have the jack.” 

“Well, if we can’t use the doors, 
we should make sure of the escape 
tunnel. Duke’s shoulder isn’t so good. 
My ribs are sore but I can work — 
today. Tomorrow Duke and I will be 
stiff and twice as sore. There are 
those steel bottles cluttering the 
hatch and plunder stored in the hole. 
Takes work. Boss, I say we’ve got 
to be sure of our escape — while 
we’re still in pretty good shape.” 

“I hate to order heavy work. But 
you’ve convinced me.” Hugh stood 
up, suppressing a groan. “Let’s get 
busy.” 

“Fve got one more suggestion.” 
“So?” 

“You ought to sack in. You 
haven’t been to bed at all and you 
got banged up pretty hard.” 

“Fm okay. Duke has a bad shoul- 
der, you’ve got cracked ribs. And 
there’s heavy work to be done.” 

“I plan to use block and tackle to 
skid those bottles aside. Barbara can 
help. She’s husky, for a girl.” 

“Certainly I can,” agreed Barbara. 
“I’m bigger than Joe is. Excuse me, 
Joe.” 

“No argument. Boss. Hugh. I 
don’t like to emphasize it but / 
thought of this. You admit you’re 



tired. Not surprising, you’ve been on 
the go twenty-four hours. Do you 
mind my saying that I would feel 
more confident you could get us 
through if you would rest?” 

Hugh grinned. “Ganging up on 
me. All right, I’ll take a nap.” 

A few minutes later he was in the 
bottom bunk in the men’s dormitory, 
his feet braced against the foot 
board. He closed his eyes and was 
asleep before he could get his wor- 
ries organized. 

D uke and Joe found that five 
of the bolts of the inned door 
were stuck. “We’ll let them be,” Joe 
decided. “We can always drift them 
back with a sledge hammer. Let’s 
crank back the armor door.” 

The armor door, beyond the bolt- 
ed door, was intended to withstand 
as much blast as the walls. It was 
cranked into place, or out, by a rack 
and gear driven, by a long crank. 

Joe could not budge it. Duke, 
heavier by forty pounds, put his 
weight on it — no results. Then they 
leaned on it together. 

“Frozen.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Joe you mentioned a sledge ham- 
mer.” 

The young Negro frowned. 
“Duke, I would rather your father 
tried that. We could break the crank. 
Or a tooth on the rack.” 

“The trouble is, we’re trying to 
crang a ton or so of door up hill 
when it was meant to move on the 
level.” 

“Yes. But this door always has 
been pesky.” 

“What do we do?” 

“We get at the escape tunnel.”

IF 




A block and tackle was fastened 
to a hook in the ceiling; the giant 
bottles were hauled out of the jum- 
ble and stacked, with Barbara and 
Karen heaving on the line and the 
men guiding them and then bracing 
them so that the stack could not roll. 
When the middle of the floor was 
clear they were able to get at the 
manhole cover to the tunnel. It was 
the massive, heavey-traffic sort and 
the hook in the celling 




It came up, creaking. It swung 
suddenly because of the 30° out-of- 
plumb of everything, taking a nick 
out of Duke’s shin and an oath out 
of Duke. 

The hole was packed with provis- 
ions. The girls dug them out, Karen, 
being smaller, going down inside as 
they got deeper and Barbara stock- 
ing the stuff. 



Karen stuck her head up. “Hey! 
Water boss! There’s canned water 
here.” 

“WeU, goody for me!” 

Joe said, ‘T had forgotten that 
This hatch hasn’t been opened since 
the shelter was stocked.” 

‘Toe shall I knock out the 
braces?” ^ 

‘T’U get ’em. You clear out the 
supplies. Duke, this isn’t armored the 
way the door is. Those braces hold 
a piece of boiled plate against the 
opening, with the supplies behind it 
and the manhole cover holding it all 
down. Inside the tunnel, at ten-foot 
intervals, are walls of sand bags, and 
the mouth has dirt over it. Your fa- 
ther said the idea was to cofferdam 
a blast. Let it in, slow it down, a 
piece at a time.” 

“We’ll find those sand bags 
jammed against that boiler plate.” 
“If so, we’ll dig ’em out.” 

“Why didn’t he use real armor?” 
“He thought this was safer. You 
saw what happened to the doors. I 
would hate to have to pry loose a 
steel barrier in that tunnel.” 

“I see. Joe, I’m sorry I ever called 
this place a ‘hole in the ground.’ ” 
“Well, it isn’t. It’s a machine — a 
survival machine.” 

“I’m through,” Karen announced. 
“Some gentleman help me up. Or 
you, Duke.” 

“I’ll put the lid on with you un- 
der it.” Duke helped his sister to 
climb out. 

J oe climbed down, flinching at 
the strain on his ribs. Dr. Liv- 
ingstone had been superintending. 
Now he followed his friend into the

ihole, using Joe’s shoulders as a land- 
ing. 

“Duke, if you’ll hand me that 
sledge — Slay out of the way, Doc. 
Get your tail down.” 

“Want me to take him?” asked 
Karen. 

“No, he likes to be in on things. 
Somebody hold the light.” The 
braces were removed and piled on 
the floor above. 

“Duke, I need the tackle now. I 
don’t want to hoist the plate. Just 
take its weight so I can swing it 
back. It’s heavy.” 

“Here it comes.” 

“That’s good. Doc! Darn you. 
Doc! Get out from under my feet! 
Just a steady strain, Duke. Some 
body hand me the flashlight. I’ll 
swing her back and have a look.” 
“And get a face full of isotopes.” 
“Have to chance it. A touch more 
— That’s got her, she’s swinging 
free.” 

Then Joe didn’t say anything. At 
last Duke said, “What do you see?” 
“I’m not sure. Let me swing it 
back, and hand me one brace.” 
“Right over your head. Joe, what 
do you see?” 

The Negro was swinging the plate 
back when suddenly he grunted. 
“Doc! Doc, come back here! That 
little scamp! Between my legs and 
into the tunnel. Doc.'” 

“He can’t get far.” 

“Well — Karen, will you go wake 
your father?” 

“Damn it, Joe! What do you see?*' 
“Duke, I don’t know. That’s why 
I need Hugh.” 

“I’m coming down.” 

“There isn’t room. I’m coming up, 
so Hugh can go down.” 



Hugh arrived as Joe scrambled 
out. “Joe, what do you have?” 
“Hugh, look for yourself.” 

“Well — I should have built a lad- 
der for this. Give me a hand.” Hugh 
went down, removed the brace, 
swung back the plate. 

He stared even longer than Joe 
had, then called up. “Duke! Let’s 
heave this plate out.” 

“What is it. Dad?” 

“Get the plate out, then you can 
come down.” It was hoisted out; fa- 
ther and son exchanged places. Duke 
stared down the tunnel. “That’s 
enough, Duke. Here’s a hand,” said 
Hugh extending his arm. 

Duke rejoined them; his father 
said, “What do you think?” 

“I don’t believe it.” 

“Daddy,” Karen said tensely, 
“somebody is going to talk, or I’m 
going to wrap this sledge hammer 
right around somebody’s thick 
skuU.” 

“Yes, baby. Uh, there’s room for 
you girls to go down together.” 
Barbara was handed down by 
Duke and Hugh, she helped Karen 
down over her. Both girls scrunched 
down and looked. 

Karen said softly. “I’ll be gol- 
damed!” She started crawling into 
the tunnel. 

Hugh called out, “Baby! Come 
back!” Karen did not answer. He 
added, “Barbara, tell me what you 
see.” 

“I see,” Barbara said slowly, “a 
beautiful wooded hillside, green 
trees, bushes, and a lovely sunny 
day.” 

“That’s what we saw.” 

“But it’s impossible,” 

“Yes.”

H ugh turned to his deputy 
“Joe, Pm going out. Get me a 
forty-five and a belt. I shouldn't 
have let those girls go out unarmed.” 
He eased himself down the hole. 
“You two guard the place.” 

His son said, “Against what? 
There’s nothing to guard in here.” 
His father hesitated. “I don’t 
know. Just a spooky feeling. All 
right, cpme along. But arm yourself. 
Joe!” 

“Coming!” 

“Joe, arm Duke and yourself. 
Then wait until we get outside. If 
we don’t come back right away, use 
your judgment This situation I 
hadn’t anticipated. It just can't be,** 
“But it is.” 

“So it is, Duke.” Hugh buckled on 
the pistol, dropped to his knees. 
Framed in the tunnel’s mouth was 



still the vision of lush greenness 
where there should have been blast- 
ed countryside and crater glass. He 
started to crawl. 

He stood up and moved away 
from the mouth, then looked 
around. 

“Daddy! Isn’t this lovely!** 

Karen was below him oh a slope 
that ran down to a stream across it 
the land rose and Was covered with 
trees. On this side was a semi-clear- 
ing. The sky was blue, sunlight warm 
and bright, and there was no sign of 
war’s devastation, nor any sign of 
man — not a building, a road, a 
path, no contrails in the sky. It was 
wilderness, and there was nothing 
that he recognized. 

“Daddy. I’m going down to the 
creek.” 

“Come here! Where’s Barbara?” 

“Up here, Hugh.” He turned and 
saw her up the slope, above the shel- 
ter. “I’m trying to figure out what 
happened. What do you think?” 

The shelter sat cocked on the 
slope, a huge square monolith. Dirt 
clung to it save where the tunnel 
had cracked off and a jagged place 
where the stair well had been. The 
armor door was exposed just above 
him. 

“I don’t think,” he admitted. 

Duke emerged, dragging a rifle. 
He stood up, looked around, and 
said nothing. 

Barbra and Karen joined them. 
Dr. - Livingston - I - Presume came 
bounding up to tag Hugh on the 
ankle and dash away. Obviously the 
Persian gave the place full approval; 
it was just right for cats. 

Duke said, ‘T give up. Tell me.” 

Hugh did not answer. Karen said,

‘•Daddy, why can’t I go down to the 
creek? I’m going to take a bath. I 
stink.” 

“It won’t hurt you to stink. I’m 
confused, I don’t want to be con- 
fused still more by worrying about 
your drowning — ” 

“It’s shallow.” 

“ — or eaten by a bear or falling 
in quicksand. You girls go inside, 
arm yourselves, and then come out 
if you want to. But stick close and 
keep your eyes peeled. Tell Joe to 
come out.” 

“Yes, sir.” The girls went. 

“What do you think, Duke?” 
“Well'. I reserve my opinion.” 
“If you have one, it’s more than 
I have. Duke, I’m stonkered. I 
planned for all sorts of things. This 
wasn’t on the list. If you have opin- 
ions, for God’s sake spill them.” 
“Well — This looks like mountain 
oountry in Central America. Of 
course that’s impossible.” 

“No point in worrying about 
whether it’s possible. Suppose it was 
Central America. What would you 
watch for?” 

“Let me see. Might be cougars. 
Snakes certainly, Tarantulas and 
•corpions. Malaria mosquitoes. You 
mentioned bears.” 

“I meant bears as a symbol. We’re 
firing to have to watch everything, 
every minute, until we know what 
we’re up against.” 

oe came out carrying a rifle. 

He kept quiet and looked 
•round. Duke said, “We won’t 
itarve. Off to the left down by the 
■Iream.” 

Hugh looked. A dappled fawn, 
hardly waist high, was staring at 

96 



them, apparently unafraid. Duke 
said, “Sh^ 1 drop it?” He raised the 
rifle. 

“No. Unless you are dead set on 
fresh meat.” 

“All right. Pretty thing, isn’t it?” 
“Very. But it’s no North Ameri- 
can deer I ever saw. Duke? Where 
are we? And how did we get here?” 
Duke gave a lopsided grin. “Dad, 
you appointed yourself Fuehrer. 
I’m not supposed to think.” 

“Oh, rats!” 

“Anyhow, I don’t know. Maybe 
the Russkis developed a hallucin- 
ation bomb.” 

“But would we all see the same 
thing?” 

“No opinion. But if I had shot 
that deer. I’ll bet we could have eat- 
en it.” 

“I think so, too. Joe? Ideas, opin- 
ions, suggestions?” 

Joe scratched his head. “Mighty 
pretty country. But I’m a city boy.” 
“One thing you can do, Hugh.” 
“What, Duke?” 

“Your little radio. Try it.” 

“Good idea.” Hugh crawled in- 
side, caught Karen about to climb 
down, sent her baciv ^Dr it. While 
he waited, he wondered what he had 
that was suitable for a ladder? 
Chinning themselves in a six-foot 
manhole was tedious. 

The radio picked up static but 
nothing else. Hugh switched it off. 
“We’ll try it tonight. I’ve gotten 
Mexico with it at night, even Can- 
ada.” He frowned. “Something 
ought to be on the air. Unless they 
smeared us completely.” 

“Dad, you aren’t thinking 
straight.” 

“How, Duke?” 




IF 




“This area did not get smeared.** 
“That’s why I can’t understand a 
radio silence.” 

“Yet Mountain Springs really 
caught it. Ergo, we aren’t in Moun- 
tain Springs.” 

“Who said we were?” Karen an- 
swered. “There’s nothing like this in 
Mountain Springs. Nor the whole 
state.” 

Hugh frowned. “I guess that’s ob- 
vious.” He looked at the shelter, 
gross, huge, massive. “But where 
are we?” 

“Don’t you read comic books. 
Daddy? We’re on another planet.” 
“Don’t joke, baby girl. I’m wor- 
ried.” 

“1 wasn’t joking. There is nothing 
like this within a thousand miles of 
home — yet here we are. Might as 
well be another planet. The one we 
had was getting used up.** 

“Hugh,” Joe said, “it sounds silly. 
But I agree with Karen.” 

“Why, Joe?” 

“Well, we’re someplace, .What 
happens when an H-bomb explodes 
dead on you?” 

“You’re vaporized.” 

“I don’t feel vaporized. And I 
can’t see that big hunk of concrete 
sailing a thousand miles or so, and 
crashing down with nothing to show 
for it but cracked ribs and a hurt 
shoulder. But Karen’s idea — ” He 
shrugged. “Call it the fourth dimen- 
sion. That last big one nudged us 
through the fourth dimension.” 
Barbara said, “Karen, I don’t see 
how this can be anything but Earth.” 
“Why? Spoilsport.” 

“Well — ” Barbara chucked a peb- 
ble at a tree. “That’s a eucalyptus, 
and an acacia beyond it. Not at all 



like Mountain Springs but a normal 
grouping of tropical and subtropical 
flora. Unless your ‘new planet* 
evolved plants just like Earth, this 
has to be Earth.” 

“Hubert! Hubert! Where are you? 
I can’t find you!” Grace Fmham’t 
voice echoed out the Uumd. 

Hugh ducked into the tunnel. 
“Coming!” 

T hey ate lunch under a tree a 
little distance from the shelter. 
Hugh decided that the tunnel had 
been buried so deeply that the 
chance of its mouth being more ra- 
dioactive than the interior was neg- 
ligible. As for the roof, he was not 
certain. So he placed a dosimeter 
(the only sort of radiation instru- 
ment that had come through the 
pummeling) on top of the shelter to 
compare it later with one inside. He 
was relieved to see that the dosime- 
ters agreed that they had suffered 
less than lethal dosage — although 
large — and that they checked each 
other. 

The only other precaution he 
took was for them to keep guns by 
them — all but his wife. Grace 
Farnham “couldn’t stand guns,” and 
resented having to eat with guns in 
sight. 

But she ate with good appetite. 
Duke had built a fire and they were 
blessed with hot coffee, hot canned 
beef, hot peas, hot canned sweet po- 
tatoes, and canned fruit salad — 
and cigarettes with no worry about 
air or fire. 

“That was lovely,” Grace admit- 
ted. “Hubert dear? Do you know 
what it would take to make it just 
perfect? You don’t approve of

drinking in the middle of the day 
but these are special circumstances 
and my nerves are still a teensy bit 
on edge — so, Joseph, if you will 
fust run back inside and fetch a bot- 
tle of that Spanish brandy — ” 
‘‘Grace.” 

“What dear? — then all of us 
could celebrate our miraculous es- 
cape. You were saying?” 

“Most of the liquor was broken. 
That brings up something else. 
Duke, you are out of a job as water 
boss. I’d like you to take over as 
bartender. There arc at least two 
unbroken fifths. Whatever you find, 
split it six ways and make it share 
and share alike, whether it’s several 
bottles each, or just a part of a bot- 
tle.” 

M rs. Farnham looked blank 
Duke looked uneasy. Karen 
•aid hastily, “Daddy, you know what 
I said.” 

“Oh, yes. Duke, your sister is on 
the wagon. So hold her share as a 
medicinal reserve. Unless she 
changes her mind.” 

“I don’t want the job,” said Duke. 
“We have to divide up the chores, 
Duke. Oh yes, do the same with ciga- 
rettes. When they are gone, they’re 
gone, whereas I have hopes that we 
can distill liquor later.” He turned 
to his wife. “Why not have a Mil- 
town, dear?” 

“Drugs! Hubert Farnham, are you 
telling me that I can't have a drink?” 
“Not at all. At least two fifths 
came through. Your share would be 
about a half pint. If you want a 
drink, go ahead.” 

“Well! Joseph, run inside and 
fetch me a bottle of brandy.” 



“No!” her husband countermand- 
ed. “If you want it, Grace, fetch it 
yourself.” 

“Oh, shucks, Hugh, I don’t mind.” 
“I do. Grace, Joe’s ribs are 
cracked. It hurts him to climb. You 
can manage the climb with those 
boxes as steps — and you’re the 
only one who wasn’t hurt.” 

“That’s not true!” 

“Not a scratch. Everybody else 
was bruised or worse. Now about 
jobs. I want you to take over as 
cook. Karen will be your assistant 
Okay, Karen?” 

“Certainly, Daddy.” 

“It will keep you both busy. Wc^ll 
build a grill and dutch oven, but it 
will be cook over a campfire and 
wash dishes in the creek for a 
while.” 

“So? And will you please tell me 
Mr. Farnham, what Joseph is going 
to do in the meantime? To earn his 
wages?” 

“Will you please tell me, how 
we’ll pay wages? Dear, dear — can’t 
you see that things have changed?” 
“Don’t be preposterous! Joseph 
will get every cent coming to him 
and he knows it — just as soon as 
this mess is straightened out. After 
all, we’ve saved his life. And we’ve 
always been good to him, he won’t 
mind waiting. Will you, Joseph?” 
“Grace! Quiet down and listen. 
Joe is no longer our servant. He is 
our partner in adversity. We’ll nev- 
er pay him wages again. Quit acting 
like a child and face the facts. We re 
broke. We’re never going to have 
any money again. Our house is gone. 
My business is gone. The Mountain 
Exchange Bank is gone. We’re

•tored in the ^her. But we are 
kicky. We’re alive and by some mir- 
acle have a chance of scratching a 
Mving out of the ground. Lucky. Do 
you understand?” 

*'Oh!” She burst into tears and fled 
into the shelter. 

Her behind was disappearing 
when Duke got up to follow. His 
father stopped him. ‘‘Duke!” 

“Yes.” 

“One word and you can join your 
mother. I’m going exploring, I want 
you to go with me.” 

Duke hesitated. “All right.” 

“We’ll start shortly. I think your 
job should be ‘hunter.’ You’re a bet- 
ter shot than I am and Joe has nev- 
er hunted. What do you think?” 
“Uh — All right.” 

“Good. Well, go soothe her down 
and, Duke, see if you can make her 
see the facts.” 

“Maybe. But I agree with Moth- 
er. You were bullying her.” 

“As may be. Go ahead.” 

D uke turned abruptly and then 
left. Karen said quietly, “I 
Aink so, too. Daddy. You were 
bullying . .” 

“I intended to. I judged it called 
for bullying. Karen, if I hadn’t 
tromped on it, she would do no 
work. and would order Joe 
around, treat him as a hired cook.” 
“Shucks, Hugh, I don’t mind 
cooking. It was a pleasure to rustle 
lunch.” 

“She’s a better cook than you arc, 
Joe, and she’s going to cook. Don’t 
let me catch you fetching and car- 
rying for her.” 

The younger man grinned. “You 
won’t catch me.” 



“Better not. Or I’ll skin you and 
nail it to the barn. Barbara, what 
do you know about farming?” 
“Very little.” 

“You’re a botanist.” 

“No, I simply might have been 
one, some day.” 

“Which makes you eight times as 
much of a farmer as the rest of us. 
I can barely tell a rose from a dan- 
delion; Duke knows even less and 
Karen thinks you dig potatoes out 
of gravy. You heard Joe say he was 
a city boy. But we have seeds and 
a small supply of fertilizers. Also 
garden tools and books about farm- 
ing. Look over what we’ve got and 
find a spot for a garden. Joe and I 
will do the spading and such. But y%u 
will have to boss.” 

Hugh and his son left a half hour 
later. “Joe,” Hugh cautioned, “we 
plan to be back before dark but if 
we get caught, we’ll keep a fire go- 
ing all night and come back tomor- 
row. If you do have to search for 
us, don’t go alone; take one of the 
girls. No, take Karen; Barbara has 
no shoes, just some spike-heeled 
sandals. Damn. Moccasins — we’ll 
have to make. Got it?” 

“Sure.” 

“We’ll head for that hill — that 
one. I want to get high enough to 
get the lay of the land and may- 
be spot signs of civilization.” They 
set out — rifles, canteens, hand ax, 
machete, matches, iron rations, 
compasses, binoculars, mountain 
boots, coveralls. Coveralls and boots 
fitted Duke as well as Hugh; Duke 
found that his father had stocked 
clothes for him. 

They took turns, with the men 
following blazing trail and counting 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 




paces, the leader keeping lookout, 
compass direction, and record. 

The high hill Hugh had picked 
was across the stream. They ex- 
plored its bank and found a place 
to wade. Everywhere they flushed 
game. The miniature deer were 
abundant and apparently had never 
been hunted. By man, at least — 
Duke saw a mountain lion and twice 
they saw bears. 

I t seemed to be about three o^clock 
local time as they approached the 
fummit. The climb was steep, clut- 
tered with under growth and neither 
man was in training. When they 
reached the flattish summit Hugh 
wanted to lay on the ground. 

Instead he looked around. To the 
east the ground dropped off. Ho 
•tared out over miles of prairie. 

He could see no sign of human 
life. 

He adjusted his binoculars and 
•tarted searching. He saw moving 
figures, decided that they were ante- 
lope — or cattle; he made mental 
note that these herds must he 
watched. Later, later — 

“Hugh?” 

He lowered his binoculars. “Yes, 
Duke?” 

“See that peak? It's fourteen 
tiiousand one hundred and ten feet 
high.” 

“I won’t argue.” 

“That’s Mount James. Dad, wc*re 
home!” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Look southwest. Those three 
gendarmes on that profile. The mid- 
dle one is where I broke my leg 
when 1 was thirteen. That pointed 
mountain between there and Mount 

. 40 



James — Hunter’s Hcurn. Can’t you 
see? The skyline is as distinctive as 
a finger print. This is Mountain 
Springsl” 

Hugh stared. This skyline ho 
knew. His bedroom window was 
planned to let him see It at dawn; 
many sunsets he had watched it 
from his roof. 

“Yes.” 

“Yes,” Duke agreed. “Damned if 
I know how. But as I figure it — ” 
he stomped the ground — “we’re on 
the high reservoir. Where it ought to 
be.” His brow wrinkled. “And as 
near as I can tell, our shelter i^ 
smack on our lot. 

Hugh took out the notebook in 
which was recorded paces and com- 
passes courses, did some arithmetic. 
“Yes. Within the limits of error.” 

“Well? How do you figure it?” 

Hugh looked at the skyline. “I 
don’t. Duke how much daylight do 
we have?” 

“Well . three hours. The sun 
will be behind the mountains in two.” 

“It took two hours to get here; 
we should make it back in less. Do 
you have any cigarettes?” 

“Yes.” 

“May I have one? Charged 
against me, of course. I would like 
to rest about one cigarette, then 
start back.” He looked around. “It’s 
open up here. 1 don't think a bear 
would approach us.” He placed his 
rifle and belt on the ground, settled 
down. 

Duke offered a cigarette to his 
father, look one himself. “Dad, 
you’re a cold fish. Nothing excites 
you.” 

“So? I’m so excitable that I had 
to karn never to give into it.” 



IF 




“Doesn’t seem that way to other 
people.” TTiey smoked in silence, 
Duke seated, Hugh sprawled out. 
He was close to exhaustion and 
wished that he did not have to hike 
back. 

Presently Duke added, “Besides 
that, you enjoy bullying.” 

His father answered, “I suppose 
so, if you class what I do as bully- 
ing. No one ever does anything but 
what he wants to do — ‘enjoys’ — 
within the possibilities open to him. 
If I change a tire, it’s because I en- 
joy it more than being stranded.” 
“Don’t get fancy. You enjoy bul- 
lying Mother. You enjoyed spanking 
me as a kid . until Mother put her 
foot down and made you stop.” 

His father said, “We had better 
start back.” 

“Just a second. I want to show 
you something. Never mind your 
gear, this won’t take a moment.” 
Hugh stood up. “What is it?” 
“Just this. Your Captain Bligh act 
is finished.” He clouted his father. 
“That’s for bullying Mother!” He 
clouted him from the other side and 
harder, knocking his father off his 
feet. “And that’s for having that nig- 
ger pull a gun on me!” 

H ugh Farnham lay where he had 
fallen. “Not ‘nigger,’ Duke. 
Negro.” 

“He’s a Negro as long as he be- 
haves himself. Pulling a gun on me 
makes him a goddam nigger. You 
can get up. I won’t hit you again.” 
Hugh Farnham got to his feet. 
“Let’s start back.” 

“Is that all you’ve got to say? Go 
ahead. Hit me. I won’t hit back.” 
“No.” 



“I didn’t break my parole. I wait- 
ed until we left the shelter.” 

“Conceded. Shall I lead? Better, 
perhaps.” 

“Do you think I’m afraid you 
might shoot me in the back? Look, 
Dad, I had to do it!” 

“Did you?” 

“Hell, yes. For my own self 
respect.” 

“Very well.” Hugh. buckled on his 
belt, picked up his gun, and headed 
for the last blaze. 

They hiked in silence. At last 
Duke said, “Dad?” 

“Yes, Duke?” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“Forget it.” 

They went on, found where they 
had forded the stream, crossed it. 
Hugh hurried as it was growing 
darker. Duke closed up again. “Just 
one thing. Dad? Why didn’t you as- 
sign Barbara as cook? She’s the 
freeloader. Why pick on Mother?” 
Hugh took his time in answering. 
“Barbara is no more a freeloader 
than you are, Duke, and cooking is 
the only thing Grace knows. Or were 
you suggesting that she loaf while 
the rest of us work?” 

“No. Oh, we all have to pitch in 
— granted. But no more bullying, 
no more bawling Mother out in pub- 
lic. Understand me?” 

“Duke.” 

“Yeah?” 

“I’ve been studying karate three 
afternoons ... week ... the past year.” 
“So?” 

“Don’t try it again. Shooting me 
in the back is safer.” 

“I hear you.” 

“Until you decide to shoot me, it 
would be well to accept my leader-

ship. Or do you wish to the 

responsibility?” 

“Are you offering it?** 

“I am not in a postdon to. Per- 
haps the group w<nikl accept you. 
Your mother would. Possibly yow 
sister would prefer you. Concerning 
Barbara and Joe I offer no opinion.** 
“How about you, Dad?*’ 

“I won’t answer that; I owe you 
nothing. But until you decide to 
make a bid for leadership, I expect 
the same willing discipline you 
showed under parole.” 

“ ‘Willing discipline’ indeed!” 

“In the long run there is no other 
sort. I can’t quell a mutiny every 
few hours — and I’ve had two from 
you plus an utter lack of discipline 
from your mother. No leader can 
function on those terms. So I will 
‘assume your willing discipline. That 
Includes no interference should I de- 
cide again to use what you call 
•bullying.’ ” 

“Now see here, I told you I would 
sot stand for — ” 

“Quiet! Unless you make up your 
asind to that, your safest choice is 
in shoot me in the back. Don’t come 
at me with bare hands nor risk giv- 
ing me a chance to shoot first. At 
4be next sign of trouble, Duke, I will 
kfll you. If possible. One of us will 
surely be killed.” 

They trudged along in silence, 
Mr. Farnham never looking back. At 
last Duke said, “Dad, for Christ’s 
sake, why can’t you run things demo- 
cratically? I don’t want to boss 
Ihings, I simply want you to be fair 
about it.” 

“Mmm, you don’t want to boss. 
You want to be a backseat driver — 
with a veto over the driver.” 



"Notsf I simply want tilings run 
democratically.” 

“You do? Shall we vote on 
idiether Grace k to work like die 
rest of us? Whether she shall hog 
the liquor? Shall we use Robert’s 
Rules of Order? Should she with- 
draw while we debate it? Or should 
she stay and defend herself against 
charges of indolence and drunken- 
ness? Do you wish to submit your 
mother to such ignominy?” 

“Don’t be silly!” 

“I am trying to find out what you 
mean by ‘democratically.’ If you 
mean putting every decision to a 
vote, I am willing — if you will bind 
yourself to abide by every majority 
decision. You’re welcome to run for 
chairman. I’m sick of the responsi- 
bility and I know that Joe does not 
like being my deputy.” 

“That’s another thing. Why 
should Joe have any voice in these 
matters?” 

“I thought you wanted to do it 
‘democratically’?” 

‘'Yes, but he is — ” 

“What, Duke? A ‘nigger’? Or a 
servant?” 

“You’ve got a nasty way of put- 
ting things.” 

“You’ve got nasty ideas. We’ll try 
formal democracy — rules of order, 
debate, secret ballot, everything — 
any time you want to try such fool- 
ishness. Especially any time you 
want to mutiny and move a vote 
of no confidence and take over the 
leadership . and I’m so bitter 
as to hope that you succeed. In the 
meantime we do have a good demo- 
cracy.” 

“How do you figure?” 

“I’m serving by consent of the ma- 

ir 



42 




jority — four to two, I think. But 
that doesn't suit me; I want it to be 
unanimous, I can’t put up indef- 
initely with wrangling from the mi- 
nority. You and your mother, I 
mean. I want it to be five to one 
before we get back, with your as- 
surance that you will not interfere 
in my efforts to persuade, or cajole, 
or bully, your mother into accept- 
ing her share of the load — until 
you care to risk a vote of no con- 
fidence.” 

“You’re asking me to agree to 

thatr 

“No, Tm telling you. Willing dis- 
cipline on your part ... or at the 
next clash one of us will be killed, I 
won’t give you the slightest warning. 
That’s why your safest course is to 
shoot me in the back.” 

“Quit talking nonsense! You know 
I won’t shoot you in the back.” 

“So? I will shoot you in the back 
or anywhere at the next hint of 
trouble. Duke, I can see only one 
alternative. If you find it impossible 
to give willing disciplined consent, if 
you don’t think you can displace me, 
if you can’t bring yourself to kill 
me, if you don’t care to risk a clash 
in which one of us will be killed, 
then there is still a peaceful solu- 
tion.” 

“What is it?” 

“Any time you wish, you can 
leave. I’ll give you a rifle, ammuni- 
tion, salt, matches, a knife, what- 
ever you find needful. You don’t de- 
serve them but I won’t turn you out 
with nothing.” 

Duke gave a bitter laugh. “Send- 
ing me out to play Robinson Crusoe 
. and leaving all the women with 
you!” 



“Oh, no! Any who wish arc fret' 
to go. With a fair share of anything 
and some to boot. All three womei 
if you can sell the idea.” 

“I’ll think about it.” 

“Do. And do a little politicking 
and size up your chances of winning 
a vote against me ‘democraticall/ 
— while being extraordinarily care- 
ful not to cross wills .with me and 
thereby bring on a showdown soon- 
er than you wish. I warn you, I’m 
feeling very short-tempered; you 
loosened one of my teeth.” 

“I didn’t mean to.” 

“That wasn’t the way it felt 
There’s the shelter; you can start 
that ‘willing discipline’ by pretend- 
ing that we’ve had a lovely after- 
noon.” 

“Look, Dad, if you won’t men- 
tion — ” 

“Shut up. I’m sick of you.” 

A s they neared the shelter Karen 
saw them and yoohooed; Joe 
and Barbara came crawling out the 
tunnel. Karen waved her shovel. 
“Come see what I’ve done!” 

She had dug privies, on each side 
of the shelter. Saplings formed 
frameworks which had been 
screened by tacking cardboard from 
liquor cases. Seats had been built of 
lumber remnants from the tank 
room. “Well?” demanded Karen. 
Aren’t they gorgeousT^ 

“Yes,” agreed Hugh. “Much more 
lavish than I had expected.” He re- 
frained from saying that they had 
cost most of the lumber. 

“I didn’t do it all. Barbara did the 
carpentry. You should hear her 
swear when she hits her thumb.” 
“You hurt your thumb, Barbara?” 



PARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



43 




“It’ll get welL Come try the lad- 
der.” 

“Sure thing.” He started inside, 
Joe stopped him. 

“Hugh, while we’ve still got light, 
how about seeing something?” 

“All right. What?” 

“The shelter. You’ve been talking 
about building a cabin. Suppose we 
do: What do we have? A mud floor 
and a roof that leaks, no glass for 
windows and no doors. Seems to me 
the shelter is better.” 

“Well, perhaps,” agreed Hugh. “I 
had thought we could use it while 
pioneering, if we had to.” 

“I don’t think it’s too radioactive, 
Hugh. That dosimeter should have 
gone sky high if the roof is really 
hot.’ It hasn’t.” 

“That’s good news. But, Joe, look 
at it. A slant of thirty degrees is un- 
comfortable. We need a house with 
a level floor.” 

“That’s what I mean. Hugh, that 
hydraulic jack — it’s rated at thirty 
tons. How much does the shelter 
weigh?” 

“Oh. Let me think how many 
yards of mix we used and how much 
steel.” Hugh pondered it, got out his 
notebook. “Call it two hundred fifty 
tons.” 

“Well, it was an idea.” 

“Maybe it’s a good idea.” Hugh 
prowled around the shelter, a block 
twenty feet square and twelve high, 
iizing up angles, estimating yard- 
iges. 

“It can be done,” Hugh decided. 
“We dig under on the uphill side, to 
.he center line, cutting out enough 
o let that side settle down level. 
3amn, I wish we had power tools.” 

“How long will it take?” 



**Two men oond do it in a week 
if they didn’t run into solid rock. 
With no dynamite a boulder can be 
a problem.” 

“Too much of a problem?” 

“Always some way to cope. Let’s 
pray we don’t run into solid rock. 
As we get it dug out, we brace it 
with logs. At the end we snag the 
logs out with block and tackle. Then 
we put the jack under the downhill 
side and tilt it into place, shore it 
up and fill with what we’ve re- 
moved. Lots of sweat.” 

“I’ll start bright and early tomor- 
row.” 

“You will like hell. Not until your 
ribs have healed. I will start tomor- 
row, with two husky girls. Plus 
Duke, if his shoulder isn’t sore, after 
he shoots us a deer; we’ve got to 
conserve canned goods. Reminds me 
— what was done with the dirty 
cans?” 

“Buried ’em.” 

“Dig them up and wash them. A 
tin can is more valuable than gold; 
we’ll use them for all sorts of things. 
Let’s go in. I’ve still to admire the 
ladder.” 

T he ladder was two trimmed 
saplings, with treads cut from 
boards and notched and nailed. 
Hugh reflected again that lumber 
had been used too lavishly; treads 
should have been fashioned from 
things that could no longer be or- 
dered by picking up a telephone. 

“Thaft a beautiful ladder, Bar- 
bma!” 

She looked very pleased. “Joe did 
tile hard parts.” 

•1 did not,” Joe denied. “I just 

IF

gave advice and touched up with 
the chisel.” 

“Well, whoever did it, it’s lovely. 
Now we’ll see if it will take my 
weight.” 

“Oh, it will!” Barbara said proud- 
ly* 

The shelter had all lights burning. 
Have to caution them about batter- 
ies, too. Must tell the girls to look 
up how to make candles. “Where’^ 
Grace, Karen?” 

“Mother isn’t well. She’s lying 
down.” 

“So? You had better start dinner.” 
Hugh went into the women’s bay, 
saw what sort of not-well his wife 
suffered. She was sleeping heavily, 
mouth open, snoring, and was fully 
dressed. He reached down, peeled 
back an eyelid; she did not stir. 
“Duke.” 

“Yes?” 

“Come here. Everybody else out- 
side.” 

Duke joined him. Hugh said, 
“After lunch, did you give Grace a 
drink?” 

“Huh? You didn’t say not to.” 

“I wasn’t criticizing. How much?” 

“Just a highball. An ounce and a 
half of Scotch, with water.” 

“Does that look like one high- 
ball? Try to rouse her.” 

Duke tried, then straightened up. 
“Dad, I know you think I’m a fool. 
But I gave her just one drink. D amn 
it. I’m more opposed to her drink- 
ing than you are!” 

“Take it easy, Duke. I assume 
that she got at the bottle after you 
left.” 

“Well, maybe.” Duke frowned. 
“As soon as I found an unbroken 



bottle I gave Mother that drink. 
Then I took inventory. I think I 
found it all, unless you have some 
hidden away — ” 

“No, the cases were together.” 
“Right. I found thirteen unbroken 
bottles, twelve fifths and a quart of 
bourbon. I remember thinking that 
was two fifths each and the quart I 
would keep in reserve. I had opened 
one bottle of King’s Ransom. I 
made a pencil mark on it. We’ll 
know if she found it.” 

“You hid the liquor?” 

“I stashed it in the upper bunk on 
the other side; I figured it would be 
hard for her to climb up there. I’m 
not a complete fool, Dad. She 
couldn’t see me, she was in her 
bunk. But maybe she guessed.” 
“Let’s check.” 

T hirteen bottles were between 
springs and mattress; twelve 
nearly full. Duke held it up. “See? 
Right to the line. But there was 
another bottle we had a snort from, 
after that second bombing. What 
happened to it?” 

“Barbara and I had some after 
you went to sleep, Duke. There was 
some left. I never saw it again. It 
was in the tank room.” 

“Oh! I did, while we were bailing. 
Busted. I give up — where did she 
get it?” 

“She didn’t, Duke.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“It wasn’t liquor.” Hugh went to 
the medicines drawer, got a bottle 
with a broken seal. “Count these 
seconal capsules. You had two last 
night.” 

“Yeah.” 



PARNHAM^S FREEHOLD

“Karen had one at bedtime, one 
later; Joe had one. Neither Barbara 
nor 1 had any, nor Grace. Five.” 
“Hold it, Vm counting.” 

His father began to count as 
Duke pushed them aside. 

“Ninety-one,” Duke announced. 
“Check.” Hugh put the capsules 
back. “So she took four.” 

“What do we do, Dad? Stomach 
pump? Emetic?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Why, you heartless — She tried 
lo kill herself!” 

“Slow down, Duke. She did noth- 
ing of the sort. Four capsules, six 
grains, simply produces stupor in a 
healthy person — and she’s healthy 
as a horse; she had a physical a 
month ago. No, she snitched those 
pills to get drunk on.” Hugh scowled. 
“An alcohol drunk is bad enough. 
But people kill themselves without 
meaning to with sleeping pills.” 
“Dad, what do you mean, ‘she 
look them to get drunk on’?” 

“You don’t use them?” 

“I never had one in my life untO 
those two last night.” 

“Do you remember how you felt 
just before you went to sleep? Warm 
and happy and woozy?” 

“No. I just lay down and konked 
out. Next thing I knew I was against 
Ihe wall on my shoulders.” 

“You haven’t developed tolerance 
for them. Grace knows what they 
can do. A very hap^y drunk. I’ve 
known her to take more than one 
but she’s never been chopped off 
from liquor before. When a person 
eats sleeping pills because he can’t 
get liquor, he’s in a bad way — a 
very bad way.” 



“Dad, you should have kept liquor 
away from her long ago!” 

“How, Duke? Tell her she 
couldn’t have a drink? Take them 
away from her at parties? Quarrel 
with her in public? Fight with her in 
front of Joe? Not let her have cash, 
close out her bank account, see that 
she had no credit? Would that have 
stopped her from pawning furs?” 
“Mother would never have done 
that"* 

“It’s typical behavior in such 
cases. Duke, it is impossible to keep 
liquor away from any adult who is 
determined to have it. The United 
States government wasn’t that pow- 
erful. I’ll go further. It is impossible 
for anyone to be responsible for an- 
other person’s behavior.” 

“Uh . that’s beside the point. 
What do we do now?” 

“So it is, counselor. Well, we 
keep these pills away from her.” 
“And I’m damned well going to 
chop off the liquor completely!” 
“Oh, I wouldn’t.” 

“You wouldn’t, em? Did I hear 
correctly when you said I was liquor 
boss?” 

“The decision is up to you. I 
simply said that I wouldn’t. I think 
it’s a mistake.” 

“Well, I don’t. Dad, I won’t go 
into the matter of whether you 
could, or should, have stopped 
Mother from getting the way she is. 
But I intend to stop it.” 

V ery well, Duke. Mmm, she’s go- 
ing to be cut off anyhow in a 
matter of days. It might be easier to 
taper her off. It you decide to, Pll 
contribute a bottle from my share. 



46 



IF 




Hell, you can have both of mine. I 
like a snort as well as the next man. 
But Grace needs it.” 

“That won’t be necessary,” his son 
said crisply. “I’m not going to let 
her have any. Get it over with, she’ll 
be well that much sooner.” 

“Your decision. May I offer a sug- 
gestion?” 

“What?” 

“In the morning, be up before she 

is. Move the liquor out and bury it, 
someplace known only to you. Then 
have open one bottle at a time and 
dispense it by the ounce. Tell the 
others to drink where she can’t see 

it. You had better ditch the open 
bottle outdoors, too.” 

“Sounds reasonable.” 

“But that makes it all the more 
urgent to keep sleeping pills away 
from her.” 

“Bury them?” 

“No. We need them inside, and 
it’s not just sleeping pills. Demerol. 
Hypodermic needles. Several drugs, 
some poisonous and some addictive 
and all irreplaceable. If she can’t 
find seconal — five bottles of a hun- 
dred each, it’s bulky — there’s no 
telling what she might get into. 
We’ll use the vault.” 

“Eh?” 

“A little safe set into concrete 
back of that cupboard. Nothing in it 
but birth certificates and such, and 
some reserve ammo, and two thou- 
sand silver dollars. Toss the money 
in with the hardware, we’ll use it as 
metal. The combo is ‘July 4th, 
1776’ — ‘74-17-76.’ Better change 
it, Grace may know it.” 

“At once!” 

“No rush, she won’t wake up. ‘Re-

“Good God! Got any more dirty 
jobs?” 

“Lots of them. Duke, I’m trying 
to make it each according to his ta- 
lents. Joe is too diffident — and ha 
missed obvious economies today. 
Karen doesn’t think ahead. Barbara 
feels like a freeloader even though 
she’s not, she wouldn’t crack down. 
I would, but I’m swamped. You are 
a natural for it; you don’t hesitate 
to assert yourself. And you have 
foresight when you take the trouble 
to use it.” 

“Thank you too much. All right.” 
“The hardest thing to drill into 
them will be saving every scrap of 
metal and paper and cloth and lum- 
ber, things Americans have wasted 
for years. Fish hooks. Groceries 
aren’t as important; we’ll replace 
them, you by hunting, Barbara by 
gardening. Nevertheless better note 
what can’t be replaced. Salt. You 
must ration salt especially.” 

“Salt?” 

“Unless you run across a salt lick 
in hunting. Salt — Damn it, we’re go- 
ing to have to tan leather. All I used 
to do with a hide was rub it with 
salt and give it to the taxidermist. Im 
salt necessary?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“I’ll look it up. Damnation, we’re 
going to find that I failed to stock 
endless things we’ll be miserable 
without.”

“Dad," Duke admitted, “I think 
you’ve done mighty well." 

“So? That’s pleasant to hear. 
We’ll manage to — ” 

“Yes?" Hugh went to the tank 
room. Karen’s head stuck up out of 
the manhole. 

“Daddy, can we please come in? 
It’s dark and scary and something 
big chased Doc in. Joe won’t let us 
until you say." 

4 4Qorry Baby. Everybody come 
O in. And we’ll put the lid on." 

“Yes, sir. But Daddy, you ought 
to look outside. Stars. The Milky 
Way like a neon sign! And the Big 
Dipper — so maybe this isn’t anoth- 
er planet? Or would we still see the 
Big Dipper?" 

“I’m not certain." He recalled that 
the discovery that they were still in 
James County, Mountain Spring 
area, had not been shared. But Duke 
must tell k; it was his deduction. 
“Duke, want to take a look before 
we close up?" 

“Thanks, I’ve seen a star." 

“As you wish.” Hugh went outside 
waited while his eyes adjusted, saw 
that Karen was right: Never before 
bad he seen the heavens on a clear 
mountain night with no other light, 
nor trace of smog, to dim its glory. 

“Beautiful!" 

Karen slipped her hand into his. 
"Yes," she agreed. “But I could use 
•ome street lights. There are things 
out there. And we heard coyotes." 

“There are bears and Duke saw a 
mountain lion. Joe, better keep the 
cat in at night, and try to keep him 
close in the daytime.” 

“He won’t go far, he’s timid. And 
something just taught him a lesson." 



“And me, too!" announced Karen 
“Bears! Come, Barbie, let’s go ul 
D addy, if the Moon comes up, thk 
must be Earth — and I’ll never 
trust a comic book again." 

“Go ask your brother." 

Duke’s discovery was the main 
subject at dinner. Karen’s disap- 
pointment was offset by her interest 
in how they had mislaid Mountain 
Spfings. “Duke, are you sure you 
saw what you thought you saw?" 

“No possible mistalce," Hugh an- 
swered for him. “If it weren’t for the 
trees, you could have spotted it. We 
had to climb Reservoir Hill to get a 
clear view." 

“You were gone all that time just 
to Reservoir Hill? Why, that’s only 
five minutes away!" 

“Duke, explain to your sister 
about automobiles." 

“I think the bomb did it,” Bar- 
bara said suddenly. 

“Why, certainly. Barb. The ques- 
tion is howT^ 

“I mean the enormous H-bomb 
the Russians claimed to have in or- 
bit. The one they called the ‘Cos- 
mic Bomb.’ I think it hit us." 

44/^0 on, Barbara." 

Vj'“Well, the first bomb was aw- 
ful and the second one was bad; they 
almost burned us up. But the third 
one just hit us whammy! and then 
no noise, no heat, no rumbling, and 
the radioactivity got less instead of 
worse. Here’s my notion: You’ve 
heard of parallel worlds? A million 
worlds side by side, almost alike but 
not quite? Worlds where Elizabeth 
married Essex and Mark Anthony 
hntid redheads? And Ben Franklin

fot electrocuted with his kite? Well, 
this is one.” 

“First automobiles and now Ben- 
jamin Franklin. 1*11 go watch Ben 
Casey.** 

“Like this, Karen. The Cosmic 
Bomb hits us, dead on — and kicks 
us into the next world. One exactly 
like the one we were in, except that 
it never had men in it.** 

“I’m not sure I like a world with 
no men. I’d rather have a strange 
planet, with warlords riding thoats. 
Or is it zitidars?” 

“What do you think of my theory, 
Hugh?” 

“I’m keeping an open mind. I’ll go 
thi» far: We should not coui>t on 
finding other human beings.” 

“I go for your theory, Barbara,” 
Duke offered. “It accounts for the 
facts. Squeezed out like a melon 
seed. Pht!” 

“And we landed here.” 

Duke shrugged. “Let it be known 
as the Barbara Wells Theory of Cos- 
mic Transportation and stand adopt- 
ed. Here we are. We’re stuck with it 
— and I’m going to bed. Who sleeps 
where, Hugh?” 

“Just a second. Folks, meet the 
Rationing Officer. Take a bow, 
Duke.” Hugh explained the austerity 
program.' “Duke will work it out but 
that’s the idea. For example, I no- 
ticed a bent nail on the ground in 
the powder room. That calls for be- 
ing spreadeagled and flogged. For a 
serious offense, such as wasting a 
match, it’s keelhauling. Second of- 
fence — hang him at the yardarm I” 
“Gee! Do we get to watch?” 
“Shut up, Karen. No punishments, 
just the miserable knowledge that 



you have deprived the rest of some- 
thing necessary to life, health, or 
comfort. So don’t give Duke any 
backtalk. I want to make another 
assignment. Baby, you know short- 
hand.” 

“That’s putting it strongly. Mr. 
Gregg wouldn’t think so.” 

“Hugh, I take shorthand. What do 
you want?” 

“Okay, Barbara, you are historian. 
Today is Day One. Or start with 
the calendar we are used to, but we 
may adjust it; those were winter 
stars. Every night jot down the

As soon as possible, you really will 
be Keeper of the Flame; we will 
have to light a fire, then bank it ev- 
ery night. Sorry to have held you 
up, Duke.” 

T hey got ready for bed. Hugh 
was pleased to see that Joe un- 
dressed completely and got into the 
lower bunk, as he had been told to. 
Duke stretched out on the floor, 
bare. The room was hot; the mass 
cooled slowly and air no longer cir- 
culated with the manhole cover in 
place, despite the vents in the tank 
room. Hugh made note that he 
must devise a bearproof — and cat- 
proof — gried in place of the cover. 
Later, later — 

He took the camp lamp into the 
tank room. 

Someone had put the books back 
on shelves but some were open to 
dry; he fluffed these, hoped for the 
best. 

The last books in the world — 

So it seemed.

He felt sudden grief that abstract 
knowledge of deaths of millions had 
not given him. Somehow, the burn- 
ing of millions of books felt more 
brutally obscene than the killing of 
people. All men must die, it was 
their single common heritage. But a 
book need never die and should not 
be killed; books were the immortal 
part of man. Book burners — To 
rape a defenseless friendly book. 

Books had always been his best 
friends. In a hundred public librar- 
ies they had taught him. From a 
thousand newsstands they had 
warmed his loneliness. He suddenly 
felt that, if he had not been able to 
save some books, it would hardly be 
worthwhile to live. 

Most of his collection was func- 
tional: The Encyclopedia Britannica 
— Grace had thought the space 
should be used for a television re- 
ceiver ‘‘because they might be hard 
to buy afterwards.’* He had grudged 
its business too, but it was the most 
compact assemblage of knowledge 
on the market. “Che” Guevera’s War 
of the Guerrillas — thank God he 
wasn’t going to need that! Nor those 
next to it: “Yank” Levy’s manual on 
resistance fighting, Griffith’s Trans-

Why had he come in here? Some-

Better yet, have Barbara find them; 
it would make her feel useful. Find 
something that only Joe could do, 
too; make the poor little bastard 
feel appreciated. Loved. Remember 
to — 

He stumbled back into the main 
room, looked at the upper bunk and 
knew that he couldn’t make it. He 
lay down on the edge of Duke’s 
blanket and fell instantly asleep. 

V 

G race did not get up for break- 
fast. The girls quietly fed them, 
then stayed in to clean up. Duke 
went hunting, carrying a forty-five, 
and a hunting bow. It was his 
choice; arrows could be recovered 
or replaced, bullets were gone for- 
ever. Duke tried a few flights and 
decided that his shoulder was okay. 

He checked watches and set out, 
with an understanding that a smoky 
fire would be built to home on if he 
was not back by three. 

Hugh told the girls to take out- 
doors any book not bone dry, then 
broke out quick the shovel and start- 
ed leveling their house. Joe tried to 
join him; Hugh vetoed it. 

‘Took, Joe, there are a thousand 
things to do. Do them. But no 
heavy work.” 

“Such as what, Hugh?” 

“Uh, correct the inventories. Give 
Duke a hand by starring everything 
that can’t be replaced. In the course 
of that you’ll think of things; write 
them down. Look up how to make 
soap and candles. Check both dosi- 
meters. Strap on a gun and keep 



your eyes open — and see that those 
girls don’t go outside without guns. 
Hell, figure out a way to get plumb- 
ing and running water, with no pipe 
and no lead and no water closets 
and no portland cement.” 

“How in the world could you do 
that?” 

“Somebody did it the first time. 
And tell this bush-tailed sidewalk 
superintendent that I need no help.” 

“Okay. Come here. Doc! Come, 
come, come!” 

“And Joe. Speaking of bathrooms, 
you might offer to stand guard for 
the girls while they bathe. You don’t 
have to look.” 

“All right. I’ll offer. But I’U teU 
them you suggested it. I don’t want 
them to think — ” 

“Look, Joe. They are a couple of 
clean, wholesome, evil-minded 
American girls. Say what you please, 
they will still believe you are 
sneaking a peek. It’s part of their 
credo that they are so fatally irre- 
sistible that a man just has to. So 
don’t be too convincing; you’ll hurt 
their feelings.” 

“I get it. I guess.” Joe went away, 
Hugh started digging, while reflect- 
ing that he had never missed a 
chance, given opportunity without 
loss of face — but that incorrigible 
Sunday School lad probably would 
not sneak a peek at Lady Godiva. A 
good lad — no imagination but ut- 
terly dependable. 

Very quickly Hugh knew what his 
worst oversight had been: no wheel- 
barrow. 

He had dug only a little before 
reaching this new appreciation. Dig- 
ging by muscle power was bad but 



PARNHAM^S FREEHOLD

carrying it away in buckets was an 
affront to good sense. 

So he carried and thought about 
how to build a wheel — with no 
metal, no heating tools, no machine 
shop, no foundry, no — 

Now wait! He had steel bottles. 
There was strap iron in the bunks 
and soft iron in the periscope hous- 
ing. Charcoal he could make and a 
bellows was simply an animal skin 
and some branches. Whittle a noz- 
zle. Any dam fool who couldn’t own 
a wheel with all that was at his dis- 
posal deserved to lift and carry. 

He had ten thousand trees, didn’t 
he? Finland didn’t have a damn 
thing but trees. Yet Finland was the 
finest little country in the world. 

“Doc, get out from under my 
feet!” If Finland was still there. 
Wherever the world was. 

Maybe the girls would like a 
Finnish bath. Down where they 
could plunge in afterwards and 
squeal and feel good. Poor kids, 
they would never see a beauty par- 
lor; maybe a sauna would be a 
“moral equivalent.” Grace might like 
it. Sweat off that blubber, get her 
slender again. What a beauty she 
had been! 

Barbara showed up, with a shov- 
el. “Where did you get that? And 
what do you think you’re doing?” 
“It’s the one Duke was using. I’m 
going to dig.” • 

“In bare feet? You’re era — Hey, 
you’re wearing shoes!” 

“Joe’s. The jeans are his, too. The 
shirt is Karen’s. Where shall I dig?” 
“Just beyond me, here. Any boul- 
der over five hundred pounds, ask 
for help. Where’s Karen?” 



“Bathing. I decided to stink worst 
and bathe lat«-.” 

“When you like. Don’t try to stick 
on this job all day. You can’t.” 

“I like working with you, Hugh. 
Almost as much as — ” She let it 
hang. 

“As playing bridge?” 

“Yes, you could mention that 
too.” 

“Barbie girl.” 

He found that just digging was 
fun. Gave the mind a rest and the 
muscles a workout. Happy making. 
Hadn’t tried it for much too long. 

B arbara had been digging an 
hour when Mrs. Farn- 
ham came around a corner. Bar- 
bara said, “Good morning,” added a 
shovelful to a bucket, picked both 
up half filled, and disappeared 
around the other corner. 

Grace Farnham said, “Well! I 
wondered where you were hiding. I 
was left quite alone. Do you realize 
that?” She was in the clothes she had 
slept in. Her features looked puffy. 

“You were allowed to sleep, 
dear.” 

“It isn’t pleasant to wake up in a 
strange place alone. I’m not accus- 
tomed to it.” 

“Grace, you weren’t being slight- 
ed. You were being pampered.” 

“Is that what you call it? Then 
we’ll say no more about it, do you 
mind?” 

“Not at all.” 

“Really?” She seemed to brace 
herself, tihen said bleakly, “Perhaps 
you can stop long enough to tell me 
where you have hidden my liquor. 
My liquor. My share. 1 wouldn’t

way you’ve treated me! In front of

“Grace, you must sec Duke.” 
^What do you mtanV* 

“Duke is in charge of liquor. I 
don’t know where he put it.” 
**You*re lyingr 

“Grace, I haven’t lied to you in 
twenty-seven years.” 

"'Oh! You brutal, brutal man!” 
“Perhaps. But I’m not lying and 
the next time you say I am, it will 
go hard with you.” 

"Where's Duke? He won’t let you 
talk to me that wayl He told me so, 
he promised me!” 

“Duke has gone hunting. He 
hopes to be back by three.” 

She stared, then rushed back 
around the comer. Barbara reap- 
peared, picked up her shovel. They 
went on working. 

Hugh said, “I’m sorry you were 
exposed to that.” 

“To what?” 

“Unless you were at least a hun- 
dred yards away, you know what” 
“Hugh, it’s none of my business.” 
“Under these conditions, anything 
is everybody’s business. You have 
formed a bad opinion of Grace.” 
“Hugh, I would not dream of be- 
ing critical of your wife.” 

“You have opinions. But I want 
you to have one in depth. Visualize 
her as she was, oh, twenty-five 
years ago. Think of Karen.” 

“She would have looked like 
Karen.” 

“Yes. But Karen has never had 
responsibility. Grace had and took it 
well. I was an enlisted man; I wasn’t 
commissioned until after Pearl Har- 



bor. Her people were what is known 
as ‘good family.’ Not anxious to 
have their daughter marry a penni- 
less enlisted man.” 

“I suppose not.” 

“Nevertheless she did. Barbara, 
have you any notion what it was to 
be the wife of a junior enlisted man 
in those days? With no money? 
Grace’s parents wanted her to come 
home — but would not send her a 
cent as long as she stuck with me. 
She stuck.” 

“Good for Grace.” 

“Yes. She had no preparation for 
living in one room and sharing a 
bath down the hall, nor for waiting 
in Navy out-patient clinics. For 
making a dollar go twice as far as 
it should. For staying alone while I 
was at sea. Young and pretty and in 
Norfolk, she could have found ex- 
citement. She found a job instead — 
in a laundry, sorting dirty clothes. 
And whenever I was home she was 
bright and cheerful and un- 
complaining. Alexander was born 
the next year — ” 

“ ‘Alexander’?” 

44T^uke. Named for his mater- 
-L/ nal grandpappy; I didn’t get 
a vote. Her parents were anxious to 
make up once they had a grandson; 
they were even willing to accept me. 
Grace stayed cool and never ac- 
cepted a cent — back to work with 
our landlady minding the baby in 
weeks. 

“Those years were the roughest. 
I went up fast and money wasn’t 
such a problem. The war came and 
I was bucked from chief to j.g. and 
ended as a lieutenant commander in 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD

Seabees. In 1946 I had to choose 
between going back to chief or be- 
coming a civilian. With Grace’s 
backing, I got out. So I was on the 
beach with no job, a wife, a son in 
grammar school, a three-year-oki 
daughter, living in a trailer, prices 
high and going higher. We had some 
war bonds and a little that we had 
managed to put in the bank. 

‘‘That was the second rough p»- 
k>d. I took a stab at contracting, 
lost our savings, went to work for a 
water company. We didn’t starve 
but scraped icebox and dishrag soup 
were on the menu. Barbara, she 
•tood it like a trouper — a hard- 
working den mother, a pillar of the 
FTA, and always cheerful. 

“I was a construction boss before 
long and presently I tried contract- 
ing again. This time it clicked. I 
built a house on spec and a shoe 
string, sold it before it was finished 
end built two more at once. We’ve 
never been broke since,” he paused 
••until now.” 

Hugh Farnham looked puzzled. 
“That was when she started to slip. 
When she started having help. When 
we kept liquor in the house. We 
didn’t quarrel — we never did, save 
over the fact that I tried to raise 
Duke fairly strictly and Grace 
couldn’t bear to have the boy 
touched. 

“But that was when it started, 
when I started making money. She 
isn’t built to stand prosperity. Grace 
has always stood up to adversity 
magnificently. This is the first time 
•he hasn’t. I still think she will.” 

“Of course she will, Hugh.” 

“I hope so.” 



“I’m glad to know more about 
her, Hugh. I’ll try to be consider- 
ate.” 

“Damn it, I’m not asking that. I 
just want you to know that fat and 
foolish and self-centered isn’t all 
there is to Grace. Nor was her 
slipping entirely her fault. Fm not 
easy to live with, Barbara.” 

“So?” 

“So! When we were able to slow 
down, I didn’t. I let business keep 
me away evenings. When a woman 
is left alone, it’s easy to slip out for 
another beer when the commercial 
comes on and to nibble all evening 
along with the beer. If I was home, 
I was more likely to read than to 
visit, anyhow. And I didn’t just let 
business keep me away; I joined 
the local duplicate club. She joined 
but she dropped out. She plays a 
good social game — but I like to 
fight for every point. No criticism 
of her, there’s no virtue in playing 
as if it were life or death. Grace’s 
way is better — had I been willing 
to take it easy, too . well, she 
wouldn’t be the way she is.” 

“Nonsense!” said Barbara, sudden- 
ly flaring up. 

“Pardon me?” 

“Hugh Farnham, what a person is 
can never be somebody eise’s fault, 
/ think. I am what I am because 
Barbie herself did it. And so did 
Grace. And so did you.” She added 
in a low voice, “I love you. And 
that’s not your fault, nor is anything 
we did your fault. I won’t listen to 
you beating your breast and sobb- 
ing, ‘Mea culpa!’ You don’t take 
credit for Grace’s virtues. Why take 
blame for her faults?”

He blinked and smiled. “Seven no 
trump.” 

“That’s better.” 

“I love you. Consider yourself 
kissed.” 

“Kiss back. Grand slam. But 
watch it,” she said out of the comer 
of her mouth. “Here come the cops.” 
It was Karen, clean, shining, hair 
brushed, fresh lipstick, and smiling. 
“What an inspiring sight!” she said. 
“Would you poor slaves like a crust 
of bread and a pannikin of water?” 
“Shortly,” her father agreed. “In 
the meantime don’t carry these 
buckets too heavily loaded.” 

Karen backed away. “1 wasn’t 
volunteering!” 

“That’s all right. We aren't 
formal.” 

“But, Daddy, I’m cleanf” 

“Has the creek gone dry?” 
“Daddy! I’ve got lunch ready. Out 
front. You’re too filthy to come into 
my lovely clean house.” 

“Yes, baby. Come along, Bar- 
bara.” He picked up the buckets. 

M rs. Farnham did not appear 
for lunch. Karen stated that 
Mother had decided to eat inside; 
Hugh let it go at that — there 
would be enough hell when Duke 
got back. 

Joe said, “Hugh? About that no- 
tion of plumbing — ” 

“Got it figured out?” 

“Maybe I see a way to have run- 
ning water.” 

“If we get running water, I guar- 
antee to provide plumbing fixtures.” 
“Really, Daddy? I know what I 
want. In colored tile. Lavender, I 
think. And with a dressing — ^ 



“Shut up, infant. Yes, Joe?” 
“Well, you know those Roman 
aqueducts. This stream runs uphill 
that way. I mean it’s higher up that 
way, so someplace it’s higher than 
the shelter. As I understand it, Ro- 
man aqueducts weren’t pipe, they 
were open.” 

“I see.” Faraham considered it. 
There was a waterfall a hundred 
yards upstream. Perhaps above it 
was high enough. “But that would 
mean a lot of masonry, whether 
dry-stone, or mud mortar. And each 
arch requires a frame while it’s be- 
ing built.” 

“Couldn’t we just split logs and 
hollow them out? And support 
them on other logs?” 

“We could.” Hugh thought about 
it. “There’s an easier way, and one 
(hat would kill two birds. Barbara, 
what sort of country is this?” 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“You said that this area is at least 
semi-tropical. Can you tell what 
season it is? And what the rest of 
the year is likely to bring? What I’m 
driving at is this: Are you going to 
need irrigation?” 

“Good heavens, Hugh, I can’t 
answer that!” 

“You can try?” 

“Well — ” She looked around. “I 
doubt if it ever freezes here. If we 
had water, we might have crops all 
year. This is not a tropical rain 
forest, or the undergrowth would be 
much more dense. It looks like a 
place with a rainy season and a dry 
season.” 

“Our creek doesn’t go dry; it has 
lots of fish. Where were you think- 
ing of having your garden?” 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD

“How about this stretch down- 
stream to the south? Several trees 
should come out, though, and a lot 
of bushes.” 

“Trees and bushes are no prob- 
lem. Mmm — Joe, let’s take a walk, 
ril carry a rifle, you strap on your 
forty-five. Girls, don’t dig so much 
that it topples down on you. We 
would miss you.” 

“Daddy, I was thinking of taking 
a nap.” 

“Good. Think about it while 
you’re digging.” 

Hugh and Joe worked their way 
upstream. “What are you figuring 
on, Hugh?” 

“A contour-line ditch. We need to 
lead water to an air vent on the 
roof. If we can do that, we’ve got 
it made. A sanitary toilet. Running 
water for cooking and washing. And 
for gardening, coming in high 
enough to channel it wherever Bar- 
bara wants it. But the luxury that 
will mean most to our womenfolk 
is a bath and kitchen. We’ll clear 
the tank room and install both, using 
partitions.” 

“Hugh, I see how you might get 
water with a ditch. But what about 
fixtures? You can’t just let water 
splash, any which way, down through 
die roof.” 

“I don’t know yet, but we’ll build 
them. Not a flush toilet, it’s too 
complex. But a constant-flow toil^, 
a sort that used to be common 
aboard warships. It’s a trough with 
seats. Water runs into one end, out 
the other. We’ll bail it down the 
manhole, out the tunnel, and away 
from the house. Have you seen any 
clay?” 



ii'^here is a clay bank at the 
A stream below the house. Kar- 
en complained about how sticky it 
was. She went upstream to bathe, a 
sandy spot.” 

“I’ll look at it. If we can bake 
clay, we can make all sorts of things. 
A toilet. A sink. Dishes. Tile pipe. 
Build a kiln out of unbaked clay, 
use the kiln to bake anything. But 
clay just makes it easier. Water is 
the real gold; all civilizations were 
built on water. Joe, we are about 
high enough.” 

“Maybe a little higher? It would 
be embarrassing to dig a ditch a 
couple of hundred yards long — ” 

“Longer.” 

“ — or longer, and find that it’s 
too low and no way to get it up to 
the roof.” 

“Oh, we’ll survey it first.” 

**Survey it? Hugh, maybe you 
didn’t notice but we don’t even 
have a spirit level. That big smash 
broke its glasses. And there isn’t 
even a tripod, much less a transit 
and all those things.” 

“The Egyptians invented survey- 
ing with less, Joe. Losing the spirit 
level doesn’t matter. We’ll build an 
unspirit level.” 

“Are you making fun of me, 
Hugh?” 

“Not at all. Mechanics were 
building level and square centuries 
before you could buy instruments. 
We’ll build a plumb-bob level. That’s 
an upside down T, and a string with 
a weight to mark the vertical. You 
can build it about six feet long and 
six high to give us a long sighting 
arm — minimize the errors. Have to 
take apart one of the bunks for

boards. It’s light, fussy work you can 
do while your ribs heal. While the 
girls do the heavy, unfussy excava- 
ting.” 

“You draw it, I’ll build it.” 

“When we get the building leveled 
we’ll mount it on the roof and sight 
upstream. Have to cut a tree or two 
but we won’t have any trouble run- 
ning a base line. Intercepts we run 
with a smaller level. Duck soup, 
Joe.” 

“No sweat, huh.” 

“Mostly sweat. But twenty feet a 
day of shallow ditch and we’ll have 
irrigation water when the dry sea- 
son hits. The bathroom can wait — 
the gals will be cheered just by the 
fact that there will be one, some- 
day. Joe, it would suit me if our base 
line cuts the stream about here. 
See anything?” 

“What should I see?” 

“We fell those two trees and they 
dam the creek. Then chuck in 
branches, mud, and some brush and 
still more mud and rocks and the 
stream backs up in a pond.” Hugh 
added, “Have to devise a gate, and 
that I do not see, with what we have 
to work with. Every problem leads 
straight to another. Damn.” 

“Hugh, you’re counting your 
chickens before the cows come 
home.” 

“I suppose so. Well, let’s go see 
how much the girls have dug while 
we loafed.” 

T he girls had dug little; Duke 
had returned with a miniature 
four-point buck. Barbara and 
Karen had it strung up against a tree 
and were trying to butcher it. Karen 



teemed to have as much blood on 
her as there was on the ground. 

They stopped as the men ap- 
proached. Barbara wiped her fore- 
head, leaving a red trail. “I hadn't 
realized they were so complicated 
inside.” 

“Or so messy!” sighed Karen. 

“With that size it’s easier on the 
ground.” 

“Now he tells us. Show us, Dad- 
dy. We’ll watch.” 

“Me? I’m a gentleman sportsman; 
the guide did the dirty work. But — 
Joe, can you lay hands on that little 
hatchet?” 

“Sure. It’s sharp; I touched it up 
yesterday.” 

Hugh split the breast bone and 
pelvic girdle and spread the carcass, 
then peeled out viscera and lungs 
and spilled them, while silently con- 
gratulating the girls on not having 
pierced the intestines. “All yours, 
girls. Barbara, if you can get that 
hide off, you might be wearing it 
soon. Have you noticed any oaks?” 

“There are scrub forms. And su- 
mach, too. You’re thinking of tan- 
ning?” 

“Yes.” 

“I know how to extract it.” 

“Then you know more about tan- 
ning than I do. I’ll bow out. There 
are books.” 

“I know, I was looking it up. 
Doc! Don’t sniff at that boy.” 

“He won’t eat it,” Joe assured her, 
“unless it’s good for him. Cats are 
fussy.” 

While butchering was going on 
Duke and his mother crawled out 
and joined them. Mrs. Farnham 
seemed cheerful but did not greet

“It sassed me and I got mad.” 
“It’s a pretty piece of venison, 
Duke,” Hugh said. “Good eating.” 
His wife glanced at him. “Perhaps 
you’ll eat it; I couldn’t bear to.” 
Karen said, “Have you turned 
vegetarian. Mother?” 

“It’s not the same thir^g. I’m go- 
ii^ in, I don’t want that on me. 
Karen, don’t you dare come inside 
util you’ve washed; I won’t have 
you tracking blood in after I’ve 
rtaved away getting the place spot-

ter. “Come inside, Duke.” 

“In a moment, Mother.” Karen 
ftve the carcass an unnecessarily 
vicious cut. 

“Where did you nail it?” Hugh 

asked. 

“Other side of the ridge. I should 
ksve been back sooner.” 

“Why?” 

“Missed an easy shot and splin- 
tered an arrow on a boulder. Buck 
faver. It has been years since I used 
a ‘bow season’ license.” 

“One lost arrow, one carcass, is 
good hunting. You saved the arrow- 
head?” 

“Of course. Do I look foolish?” 
Karen answered, “No, but I do. 
Buddy, I cleaned house. If Mother 
4ld any cleaning, it was a mess she 
BMide herself.” 

“I realized that.” 

“And I’ll bet when she smells 
Biese steaks, she won’t want Spam!” 
Hugh moved away, agnal- 
iag Duke to follow.

Duke looked sheepish. “Well — 
As you pointed out, it’s rough, 
chopping it off completely.” He add- 
ed, “But I rationed her. I gave her 
one drink and told her she could 
have one more before dinner.” 
“That’s doing quite well.” 

“I had better go inside. The bot- 
tle is there.” 

“Perhaps you had.” 

“Oh, it’s all right. I put her on her 
honor. You don’t know how to han- 
dle her. Dad.” 

“That’s true. I don’t”

From the Journal of Barbara 
Wells: 

I am hobbled by a twisted ankle, 
so I am lying down and adding to 
this. I’ve taken notes every night — 
but in shorthand. I haven’t tran- 
scribed very much. 

The longhand version goes in the 
fly leaves of the Britannica. There 
are ten blank pages in each volume, 
twenty-four volumes, and I’ll 
squeeze a thousand words to a page. 
240,000 words. Enough to record 
our doings until we reclaim the art 
of making paper — especially as the 
longhand version will be censored. 

Because I can’t let my hair down 
to anyone — and sometimes a gal 
needs to! This shorthand record is a 
diary which no one can read but 
me, as Karen is as poor at Gregg as 
she claimed. 

Or perhaps Joe knows Gregg. 



IF 




Isn’t it requked in business colleges? 
But Joe is a gentleman and would 
not read this without invitation. I 
am fond of Joseph; his goodness is 
not a sham. I am sure he is keeping 
his lip buttoned on many unhappy 
thoughts; his position is as anoma- 
lous as mine and more difficult. 

Grace has quit ordering him 
around — save that she orders all 
of us. Hugh gives orders, but for the 
welfare of all. Nor does he give 
many; we are settled in a routine. 
Tm the farmer, and plan my own 
work; Duke keeps meat on the table 
and gives me a hand when he 
doesn’t hunt; Hugh hasn’t told 
either of us what to do for a long 
time, and Karen has a free hand 
with the house. Hugh has about two 
centuries of mechanical work 
planned out and Joe helps him. 

But^ Grace’s orders are for her 
own comfort. We usually carry 
them out; it’s easier. She gets her 
own way and more than her share, 
simply by being difficult. 

She got the lion’s share of liquor. 
Liquor doesn’t matter to me; I rare- 
ly “need” a drink. But I enjoy a glow 
in company and had to remind my- 
self that it was not my liquor, it was 
Farnham liquor. 

Grace finished her share in three 
days. Duke’s was next to go. And so 
on. At last all was gone save one 
quart of bourbon earmarked “me- 
dicinal.” Grace spotted where Duke 
had it and dug it up. When Duke 
came home, she was passed out and 
the bottle was dead. 

The next three days were hor- 
rors. She screamed. She wept. She 
threatened suicide. Hugh and Duke 



teamed up and one of them was al- 
ways with her. Hugh acquired a 
black eye, Duke got scratches dowB 
his handsome face. I understand 
they put a lot of B-1 into her and 
force-fed her. 

On the fourth day she stayed in 
her bunk; the next day she got up 
and seemed almost normal. 

But during lunch she asserted, ai 
something “everybody knows,” that 
the Russians had attacked because 
Hugh insisted on building a shelttf. 

D uke says we must be patient 
I should not criticize Duke; ha 
is probably going to be my husband, 
I mean, who else is there? In this 
vicinity he is quite a catch. 

(Polygamy? Of course I wouldl 
Even with Grace as senior wife. But 
I haven’t been asked.) 

The trouble is, while I like Duke, 
no spark jumps. So I am putting it 
off and avoiding circumstances 
where he might pat me on the fan- 
ny. It would be a hell of a note if I 
married him and there came a night 
when I was so irritated at his moth- 
er and so vexed with him for in- 
dulging her that I would tell him 
coldly that he is not half the man 
his father is. 

No, that must not happen. Duke 
does not deserve it. 

Joe? My admiration for him is 
unqualified. 

Joe is the first Negro I’ve had a 
chance to know well — and I think 
most well of him. He plays better 
contract than I do; I suppose he’s 
smarter than I am. The trouble with 
Joe is the same as with Duke: No 
spark jumps.

But J am fond of him — as a 
younger brother. He is never too 
busy to be accommodating. He is 
usually bear guard for Karen and 
me when we bathe and it’s a com- 
fort to know that Joe is alert — 
— Duke has killed five bears and 
Joe killed one while he was actually 
guarding us. It took three shots and 
dropped dead almost in Joe’s lap. He 
stood his ground. 

We adjourned without worrying 
about modesty, which upset Joe 
more than bears do. 

Or wolves, or coyotes, mountain 
lions, or a cat which Duke says is a 
mutated leopard and especially 
dangerous because it attacks by 
dropping out of a tree. We don’t 
bathe under trees and don’t venture 
out of our clearing without an 
man. It is as dangerous as crossing 
Wilshire against the lights. 

I t took three weeks to excavate 
under the house. Boulders! 
This area is a wide, flat saucer- 
shaped valley, with boulders most 
anywhere. Whenever we hit a big 
one, we dug around it and the men 
would worry it out with crowbar 
and block and tackle. 

Mostly the men could get boul- 
ders out. But Karen found one that 
seemed to go down to China. Hugh 
looked it over and said, “Fine. Now 
dig a hole just north of it and deep- 
er.” 

Karen just looked at him. 

So we dug. And hit another big 
boulder. “Good,” said Hugh. “Dig 
another hole north of that one.” 

We hit a third oversize boulder. 
But in three days the last one had 



been tumbled into a hole next to iU 
the middle one had been worried 
into a hole where the last one had 
been, and the one that started the 
trouble was buried where the mid- 
dle one had been. 

As fast as any spot had been cut 
deeply enough Hugh propped it up 
with pieces of log; he was worried 
lest the shelter shift and crush some- 
one. So when we finished the shel- 
ter had a forest of posts under it 
Hugh then set two very heavy 
posts under the uphill corners and 
smarted removing the inner ones, us- 
ing block and tackle. Sometimes 
they had to be dug under. Hugh was 
nervous during this and did ??} the 
rigging and digging himself. 

At last the uphill half was sup- 
ported on these two big chunks. 
They would not budge. 

There was so much weight on 
those timbers that they sneered at 
our efforts. I said, “What do we do 
now, Hugh?” 

“Try the next-to-the-last resort.” 
“What’s the last resort?” 

“Burn them. But it would take 
roaring fires and we would have to 
clear grass and bushes and trees for 
quite a distance. Karen, you know 
where the ammonia is. And the io- 
dine. I want both.” 

I had wondered why Hugh had 
stocked so much ammonia. But he 
had, in used plastic Clorox bottles; 
the stuff had ridden through the 
shocks. I hadn’t known that iodine 
was stocked in quantity, too; I don’t 
handle the drugs. 

Soon he had sort of a chemistry 
lab. “What are you making, Hugh?” 
1 asked. 



60 



IF 




“Ersatz ‘dynamite.’ And I don’t 
need company,” he said. “The stuff 
is so touchy it explodes at a harsh 
look.” 

“Sorry,” I said, backing away. 

He looked up and smiled. “It’s 
safe until it dries. I had it in mind 
in case I ever found myself in an 
underground. Occupying troops 
take a sour view of natives having 
explosives, but there is nothing sus- 
picious about ammonia or iodine. 
The stuff is safe until you put it to- 
gether and does not require a prim- 
er. But I never expected to use k 
for construction; it’s too treacher- 
ous.” 

“Hugh, I just remembered I don’t 
care whether a floor is level or not.” 

“If it makes you nervous, take a 
walk.” 

Making it was simple; he com- 
bined tincture of iodine and ordin- 
ary household ammonia; a precipi- 
tate settled out. This he filtered 
through Kleenex, the result was a 
paste. 

Joe drilled holes into those stub- 
born posts; Hugh wrapped this mess 
in two batches, in paper, and packed 
a bundle into each hole, tamping 
with his finger. “Now we wait for it 
to dry.” 

Everything that he used he 
flushed down with water, then took 
a bath with his clothes on, removed 
them in the water and left them, 
weighted down with rocks. That was 
all that day 

O ur armament includes two 
lovely ladies’ guns, .22 magnum 
rimfires with telescopic sights. Hugh 
had Duke and Joe sight them in. 

FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



The sighting-in was done with sand- 
bag rest — heaped up dirt, that vl 
Hugh had them expend five bulleli 
each, so I knew he was serious. “One 
bullet, one bear” is his motto. 

When the explosive was dry, ev- 
erything breakable was removed 
from the shelter. We women were 
chased far back. Karen was charged 
with hanging onto Dr. Livingstone, 
and I had Duke’s bear rifle. 

Duke and Joe were on their bel- 
lies a measured hundred feet from 
the posts. Hugh stood between 
them. “Ready for count?” 

“Ready, Hugh.” — “Ready, Dad." 

“Deep breath. Let part of it out 
Hold it, steady on target, take up 
the slack. Five . four . three . 
two . one . ftreV* 

A sound like a giant slammed 
door and the middle of each post 
disintegrated. The shelter stuck out 
like a shelf, then tilted ponderously 
down, touched, and was level. 

Karen and I cheered; Grace start- 
ed to clap; Dr. Livingstone jumped 
down to investigate. Hugh turned bis 
head and grinned. 

And the shelter tilted back the 
other way as the ridge crumbled; k 
started to slide. It pivoted on the 
tunnel protuberance, picked up 
speed and tobogganned down the 
slope. I thought it was going to end 
up in the creek. 

But the slope leveled off; k 
ground to a stop, with the tunnel 
choked with dirt and the whole thing 
farther out of plumb than before! 

Hugh picked up the shovel he had 
used to heap up shooting supports, 
walked down to the shovel, began 
to dig. 

41 





He was correct. The shelter wai 
level in a week, and this time he 
triggered the end posts with cross 
pieces; blasting was not needed. Best 
of all, the armor door cranked back 
without a murmur and we had air 



I ran down, tears bursting from 
my eyes. Joe was there first. Hugh 
!ooked up and said, “Joe, dig out 
the tunnel. I want to know if any- 
thing is damaged and the girls will 
Vint to get lunch.” 



“Boss — ” Joe choked out. “Boss! 
Oh, gosh!” 

Hugh said, in a tone you use to 
Thild, “Why are you upset, Joe 
This has saved us work.” 

I thought he had flipped. Joe said, 

^Huhr 

“Certainly,” Hugh assured him. 
“See how much lower the roof is? 
Every foot it dropped saves at least 
a hundred feet of aqueduct. And 
leveling will be simple here; the 
ground is loam and boulders are 
few. A week, with everybody pitch- 
ing in. Then we bring water to the 
house and garden two weeks early.” 



and sunlight inside — it had been 
stuffy and candles made it pretty 
rank. Joe and Hugh started the ditch 
the same day. In anticipation of the 
glorious day Karen sketched on the 
walls of the tank room lifesize pic- 
tures of a wash stand, a bath tub, a 
pot. 

Truthfully, we are comfortable. 
Two mattress covers Karen filled 
with dried grass; sleeping on the 
floor is no worse than the bunks. We 
sit in chairs and play our evening 
rubber at the table. It is amazing 
what a difference level floors make 
and how much better it is to have a

door than to climb down a ladder 
and crawl out a hole. 

Wc had to cook over a campfire 
a while as our grill and Dutch oven 
were smashed. Karen and I have 
thrown together a make-do because, 
as soon as water is led to the house, 
Hugh intends to start on ceramics, 
not only for a toilet and a sink but 
also for a stove vented out through 
the periscope hole. Luxury! 

My corn is coming up beautiful- 
ly. 1 wonder what I can use to grind 
corn? The thought of hot corn 
bread makes me drool.

K aren and Barbara were washing 
themselves, the day’s dishes, 
and the week’s laundry. Above 
them, Joe kept watch. Bushes and 
then trees had been cut away around 
the stretch they used for bathing; a 
predator could not approach with- 
out Joe having a clear shot at it. 
His eyes swung constantly, checking 
approaches. He wasted no seconds 
on the Elysian tableau he guarded. 

Karen said, “Barbie, this sheet 
won’t stand another laundering.” 
“We need rags.” 

“But what will we use for sheets? 
It’s this soap.” Karen scooped a 
handful from a bowl on the bank. 
It was soft and gray and harsh and 
looked like oatmeal mush. “The stuff 
eats holes.” 

“I’m not fretted about sheets but 
I dread the day when we are down 
to our last towel.” 

“Which will belong to mother.” 
Karen stated. “Our rationing officer 
will have some excellent reason.” 



“Nasty, nasty. Karen, Duke has 
done a wonderful job.” 

“I wasn’t bitching. Duke can’t 
help it. It’s his friend Eddie.” 
“‘Eddie?” 

“Edipus Rex, dear.” 

Barbara turned away and began 
rinsing a pair of ragged blue jeans. 
Karen said, “You dig me?” . 

“We all have faults.” 

“Sure, everybody but me. Even 
Daddy has a shortcoming. His neck 
pains him.” 

Barbara looked up. “Is Hugh hav- 
ing trouble with his neck? Perhaps 
it would help if we massaged it.” 
Karen giggled. “Your weakness, 
sister mine, is that you wouldn’t 
know a joke if it bit you. Daddy is 
stiff-necked and nothing will cure it. 
He doesn’t have weaknesses and 
and that’s his weakness. Don’t 
frown. I love Daddy. I admire him. 
But I’m glad I’m not like him. I’ll 
take this load up to the thorn bush- 
es. Damn it, why didn’t Daddy 
stock clothes pins? Those thorns are 
as bad as the soap.” 

“Clothes pins we can do without. 
Hugh did an incredible job. Every- 
thing from an eight-day clock — ” 
“Which got busted, right off.” 

“ — to tools and seeds and books 
and I don’t know what. Karen! 
Don’t climb out naked!” 

Karen stopped, one foot on the 
bank. “Nonsense. Old Stone Face 
won’t look. Humiliating, that’s what 
it is. I think I’ll yoo-hoo at him.” 
“You’ll do no such thing. Joe is 
being a gentleman under trying cir- 
cumstances. Karen, Joe is sweet. I 
wish you had heard him explain 
about Doc.” 



FARKHAM'S FREEHOLD

“Explain what?” Karen asked. 

“Well, Doc is beginning to accept 
me. I was holding Doc yesterday 
and noticed something and said, 
•Joe, Doc is getting terribly fat. Or 
was he always?’ 

“That was a time when he 
blushed. But he answered with sweet 
seriousness, ‘Barbara, Dr. Living- 
stone isn’t as much of a boy cat as 
he thinks he is. Old Doc is more a 
girl-type cat. That isn’t fat. Uh, you 
see — Doc is going to have babies.’ 
He blurted it out.” 

Karen looked puzzled. “Come to 
think of it, I haven’t picked him up 
lately. Just petted him and tried to 
keep him out of things. Lately it 
hasn’t been safe to open a drawer; 
he’s into it. Looking for a place to 
have kittens of course. I should have 
twigged.” 

“Karen, why do you keep saying 
•he’ and ‘him’?” 

“‘Why?’ Joe told you. Doc thinks 
he is a boy cat — and who am I to 
argue? Mmm — Calendar girl, how 
long have we been here?” 

“Sixty-two days. I’ve looked it up; 
it’s sixty days with a normal range 
to seventy.” 

“So it’s any time now. I’ll bet you 
two back rubs that we are up all 
night tonight. Cats never have kit- 
tens at a convenient hours.” Karen 
abruptly began on the dishes. 

P resently she said in a low voice, 
“Barbie, Doc won’t hand this 
household half the surprise I’m go- 
ing to.” 

“How, hon?” 

“I’m pregnant.” 

“Hm/i?” 



**Ton beard me. Pregnant I had 
a tesC the froggie winked at me. 
HeO, Fm four months gone.” Karea 
direw herself into the arms of the 
older girl “And Fm scared!'" 

Barbara hugged her. “Thwe, 
there, dear. It’s going to be all 
right.” 

“The hell it is,” Karen blubbered. 
“Mother’s going to raise hell . and 
there aren’t any hospitals . nor 
doctors. Oh, why didn’t Duke study 
medicine? Barbie, I’m going to die. 
I know I am.” 

“Karen, that’s silly. More babies 
have been born without doctors and 
hospitals than ever were wheeled 
into a delivery room. You’re not 
scared of dying, you’re scared of tell- 
ing your parents.” 

“Well, that, too.” Karen wiped at 
her eyes and sniffed. I was going to. 
But the attack hit . and then 
Mother went to pieces . and Dad- 
dy has been loaded down with wor- 
ries and there’s never been the right 
time.” 

“Karen, you aren’t scared to tell 
your father, just your mother.” 

“Well . .Mother mostly. But 
Daddy, too. Besides being shocked 
and hurt — he’ll think it was silly of 
me to get caught.” 

“While he’s certain to be sur- 
prised, I doubt the other.” Barbara 
hesitated. “Karen, you needn’t take 
this alone. I can share it.” 

“That’s what I had hoped. That’s 
why I asked you to come home with 
me. I told you.” 

“I mean really share it. I’m preg- 
nant, too.” 

^^What?" 

“Yes. We can tell them together.”

“Good Lord, Barbara! How 
did it happen?” 

Barbara shrugged. “Careless. 
How did it happen to you?” 

Karen suddenly grinned. “How? 
A bee sprinkled pollen on me; how 
else? ‘Who’ you mean.” 

“‘Who’ I don’t care about. Your 
business. Well, dear? Shall we go 
tell them? I’ll do the talking.’’ 
“Wait a minute. You hadn’t 
planned to tell anybody? Or had 
you?” 

“Why no,” Barbara answered 
truthfully, “I was going to wait until 
it showed.” 

Karen looked at Barbara’s waist- 
line. “You don’t look it. And I do; 
I’ve been careful not to undress 
around Mother. Since you don’t, 
let’s hold that back and use it as a 
whammy if things get sticky.” 

“If you like. Karen, tell Hugh 
first. Then let him tell your mother. 
And quit worrying. We’ll have our 
babies and won’t have any trouble 
and we’ll raise them together and 
it’ll be fun. We’ll be happy.” 
Karen’s eyes lit up. “And you’ll 
have a girl and Fll have a boy and 
we’ll marry them and be grand- 
mothers together!” 

“That sounds more like Karen.” 
Barbara kissed her. “Run tell Hugh.” 

K aren found Hugh bricking up 
the kiln; she told him that she 
would like a private talk. 

“All right,” he agreed. “Let me 
tell Joe to get this fired up. I should 
inspect the ditch. Come along and 
talk?” 

He gave her a shovel, carried a 
rifle. “Now what’s on your mind.” 



“Let’s get farther away.” They 
walked a meandering distance. 
Hugh stopped, exchanged rifle for 
shovel, and built up a stretch of wall. 

“Daddy? Perhaps you’ve noticed 
a shortage of men?” 

“No. Three men and three wom- 
en. The usual division.” 

“Perhaps I should say ‘eligible 
bachelors.’ ” 

“Then say it.” 

“All right, I’ve said it. I need 
advice.” 

He placed another shovelful, 
tamped it. “Say what you want, 
baby. Perhaps I can help.” 

“Hardly. I’m pregnant, Daddy.” 
He dropped the shovel, took her 
in both arms. “Oh, wonderful!” 
Presently she said, “Daddy ... I 
can’t shoot a bear with you hugging 
me. 

He put her down, grabbed the 
rifle. *^Wherer 

“Nowhere. But you’re always 
warning us.” 

“Oh. All right, I’ll take over guard 
duty. Who’s the father. Karen? 
Duke? Oh Joe?” 

“Neither. Earlier, at school.” 
“Oh. Still better!” 

“How? Damn it. Daddy, this isn’t 
going the way it’s supposed to. A 
girl comes home ruined, her father 
is supposed to raise hell. All you say 
is, ‘Just dandy!’ You’ve got me con- 
fused.” 

“Sorry. Under other circum- 
stances, I might feel that you had 
been careless. But don’t you see^ 
dear? You have almost doubled the 
chances of this colony surviving.” 
-He smiled. “I don’t feel like work- 
ing. Let’s go spread the good news.”

H ugh leaned on his shovel. “That 
just about does it, Joe.” 

"Let me tidy up around the gate.” 
They were at the upper end of their 
ditch where the stream had been 
dammed against the dry season. It 
Ihad been on them for weeks; the 
forest was sear, the heat oppressive. 
They were extremely caroful about 
fire. 

But no longer so careful about 
bears. It was still standard practice 
to be armed, but Duke had killed 
so many carnivores, ursine and fe- 
line, they seldom saw one. 

The water spilling over the dam 
was only a trickle but there was wa- 
ter for irrigation and for household 
needs. Without the ditch they would 
have lost their garden. 

It was necessary every day or so 
to adjust the flow. Hugh had not 
built a water gate; paucity of tools, 
scarcity of metal, and a total lack 
of lumber had baffled him. Instead 
he had devised an expedient, 'fhe 
point where water was taken from 
the pond had been faced with brick 
and a spillway set of halfround tile. 
To increase the flow this was taken 
out, the spill cut deeper, bricks ad- 
justed, and tiles replaced. It was 
clumsy, it worked. 

The bottom of the ditch was tiled 
all the way to house and garden; a 
minimum of water was lost. Their 
kiln had worked day and night; 
most of their capital gain had come 
out of the clay bank below the 
house and it was becoming difficult 
to dig good clay. 

This did not worry Hugh; they 



had almost everything they needed. 

Their bathroom was no longer a 
joke. Water flowed in a two-stall 
trough toilet, partitioned with deer 
hide; tile drain pipe “leaded” with 
clay ran down the manhole, out the 
tunnel, and to a cesspool. 

Forming drain pipe Hugh found 
very difficult. After many failures he 
had whittled a male form in three 
parts — in parts because it was nec- 
essary to shape the clay over it, let 
it dry enough to take out the form 
before it cracked from shrinking 
over the form. 

With practice he cut his failures 
to about 25% in forming, 25% in 
firing. 

The damaged water tank he had 
cut painfully, mallet and chisel, 
lengthwise into tubs, a bath tub in- 
doors and a wash tub outdoors. The 
seams he had caulked with shaved 
hide. The tubs did not leak — much. 

A brick fireplace-oven filled one 
corner of the bath-kitchen. It was 
not in use; days were long and hot; 
they cooked outdoors and ate under 
an awning of empty bears — but it 
was ready against next rainy season. 

Their house now had two stories. 
Hugh had concluded that an addi- 
tion strong enough to stop bears 
and tight enough to discourage 
snakes would have to be of stone, 
and solidly roofed. That he could 
do — but how about windows and 
doors? Glass he would make some 
day if he solved the problems of 
soda and lime. But not soon. A stout 
door and tight shutters he could 
manage but it would be stuffy. 

So they had built a shed on the 
roof, a grass shack. Wth the laddw

Bp, a bear faced a twelve-foot wall. 
Unsure that a wall would stop all 
their neighbors, Hugh had arranged 
trip lines around the edge so that 
disturbing them would cause an oxy- 
gen bottle to fall over. Their alarm 
was tripped the first week, scaring 
off the intruder. It had also, Hugh 
admitted, scared the bejasus out of 
him. 

Anything that could not be hurt 
by weather had been moved out 
and the main room was rearranged 
into a women’s dormitory and nur- 
sery. 

H ugh stared downstream while 
Joe finished fussing. He could 
make out the roof of his penthouse. 
Good enough, he mused. Every- 
thing was in fair shape and next 
year would be better. So much bet- 
ter that they might take time to ex- 
plore — even Duke had not been as 
much as twenty miles away. Nothing 
but feet for travel and too busy 
scratching to live — 

Next year would be soon enough. 
man*s reach should exceed his 
grasp, or whafs a heaven for?** 
They had started with neither pot 
nor window. This year a pot. Next 
year a window? No hurry. Things 
were going well. Even Grace 
seemed contented, after one hor- 
rible day-long rant. He felt c^ain 
the would settle down and be a 
happy grandmother. Grace liked 
babies — how well he remembered. 

Not long now. Karen was fuzzily 
vague but her guesses seemed to 
show that D-day was about two 
weeks off, and her condition 
matched her guess. 



The sooner, the better! Hugh had 
studied everything in his library on 
pregnancy and childbirth; he made 
every preparation he could. His pa- 
tients seemed to be in perfect 
health, both had satisfactory pelvic 
measurements, both seemed una- 
fraid, and they helped each other 
not to gain too much weight, with 
friendly nagging. With Barbara to 
hold Karen’s hand, with Karen to 
hold Barbara’s hand, with Grace’s 
motherly experience to bolster 
them, Hugh could see no trouble 
ahead. 

It would be wonderful to have 
babies in the house. 

With a warm wave of euphoria 
Hugh Famham realized that he had 
never been so happy in his life. 

44'^l^hat’s it, Hugh. Let’s catch 
A those tiles on the way back.” 

“Okay. Take the rifle. I’ll car- 
ry the tools.” 

“I think,” Joe said, “we ought 
to—” 

His words chopped off at a gun- 
shot; they froze. It was followed by 
two more. 

They ran. 

Barbara was in the door. She held 
up a gun and waved, went inside. 
She came out before they reached 
the house, stepping carefully down 
off the stoop and moving slowly; she 
was very gravid. Her belly bulged 
huge in shorts made from worn-out 
jeans that had belonged to Duke; 
she wore a man’s shirt altered to 
support her breasts. She was bare- 
footed and no longer carried the 
gun. 

Joe outdistanced Hugh, met her 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 




near the house. “Karen?” he de- 
manded. 

“Yes. She’s started. Grace is with 
her. But she wants you.” 

“Let me catch my breath.” Hugh 
wiped his face, tried to control his 
trembling. He took a deep breath, 
held it, let it out slowly. He went 
inside, Barbara following. 

The bunks near the door had been 
taken down. A bed stuck out into 
the doorway but space cleared by 
removing shelves left passage. One 
bunk was not a cot in the living cor- 
ner. The bed was padded with a 
grass mattress and a bear rug; a 
calico cat, one of Doc’s litter, was 
on it. 

Hugh squeezed past, felt another 
cat brush his ankles. He went into 
the other bay. The bunks there had 
been rebuilt into a bed across the 
end; Karen was in bed, Grace was 
seated, fanning her, and Joe stood 
by with an air of grave concern. 

Hugh smiled at his daughter. “Hi, 
Fatty!” He stooped and kissed her. 
“How are you? Hurting?” 

“Not now. But I’m glad you’re 
here.” 

“We hurried.” 

A cat jumped up, landing on Kar- 
en. “Unh! Damn you, Maggie!” 

“Joe,” said Hugh, “round up the 
cats and put them in Coventry.” The 
tunnel mouth had been bricked up, 
but with air holes, and a cat door 
which could be filled with a large 
brick. The cats had a low opinion of 
this but it had been built after Hap- 
py New Year had become missing 
and presumed dead. 

Karen said, “Daddy, 1 want Mag- 
gie with me!” 



“Joe, make that all but Maggie. 
When we get busy, grab Maggie an4 
shut up her, too.” 

“Daddy, you should have been a 
doctor.” 

“1 am a doctor. The best doctor 
in the world.” 

As he left the house he encoun- 
tered Duke, soaked from a long run. 
“I heard three shots. Sis?” 

“Yes. No hurry, labor has just 
started. I’m about to take a bath. 
Want to join me?” 

“I want to say hello to Sis first.** 
“Hurry up; they’re about to bathe 
her. And grab Joe; he’s incarcerat- 
ing cats. They’ll want us out of the 
way.” 

“Shouldn’t we be boiling water?” 
“Do so, if it will calm you. Duke, 
my O. B. kit, such as it is, has been 
ready for a month. There are six 
jars of boiled water, for this and 
that. Go kiss your sister and don’t 
let her see that you’re worried.” 
“You’re a cold fish. Dad.” 

“Son, I’m scared silly. I can list 
thirteen major complications — 
and I’m not prepared to cope with 
any of them. Mostly I pat her hand 
and tell her that everything is dandy 
— and that’s what she needs. I ex- 
amine her, solemn as a judge, and 
don’t know what to look for. It’s just 
to reassure her . and I’ll thank 
you to help out. 

Duke said soberly, “I will, sir. I’ll 
kid her along.” 

“Don’t overdo it. Just let her see 
that you share her confidence in old 
Doc Farnham.” 

“I will.” 

“If Joe gets the jitters, get him 
out. He’s the worst. Grace is doing

fine. Hurry up or they won’t let you 
in.” 

A ll that hot and weary day the 
woman brought to bed fought 
to void herself of her burden, white- 
faced and shrieking, belly hardening 
with each attempt, muscles in arms 
and neck standing out as she strained 
— then fell back limp as the con- 
traction died away, tired and trem- 
bling, not speaking, uninterested in 
anything but the ordeal. 

It got steadily worse. Contrac- 
tion became three minutes apart; 
each one longer and seemed to hurt 
more. 

At nine that night there was 
bleeding. Grace became frantic; she 
had heard many stories of the dan- 
gers of hemorrhage. Hugh assured 
her that it was normal and showed 
that the baby would arrive soon. He 
believed it, as it was not massive 
and did not continue — and it did 
not seem possible that birth could be 
far away. 

Grace looked angry and got up; 
Barbara slipped into the chair she 
vacated. Hugh hoped that Grace 
would rest — the women had been 
taking turns. 

But Grace returned a few minutes 
later. “Hubert,” she said in a high, 
brittle voice. “Herbert, Fm going to 
call a doctor. 

“Do that,” he agreed, his eyes on 
Karen. 

“You listen to me, Hubert Farn- 
ham. You should have called a doc- 
tor at once. You’re killing her, you 
hear me? Fm going to call a doctor 
— and you are not going to stop 
me.” 



"Yes, Grace. The telephone is m 
there.” He pointed into the other 
wing. Grace looked puzzled, then 
turned suddenly and went away. 
‘^Duker 

His son hurried in. “Yes, Dad?” 

Hugh said forcefully, “Duke, your 
mother has decided to telephone for 
a doctor. You go help her. Do you 
understand?^^ 

Duke’s eyes widened. “Where are 
the needles?” 

“In the smaller bundle on the 
table. Don’t touch the large bundle; 
it’s sterile.” 

“Got it. What dosage?” 

“Two c.c. Don’t let her see the 
needle, or she’ll jerk” Hugh’s head 
jerked; he realized that he was grog- 
gy. “Make that three c.c.; I want her 
to go out like a light and sleep until 
morning. She can tolerate it.” 

“Right away.” Duke left. 

Karen had been lying quiet be- 
tween contractions, apparently in 
semi-coma. Now she whispered, 
“Poor Daddy. Your women give you 
a lot of grief.” 

“Rest, dear.” 

“I — Oh, God, here it comes 
again!” 

A round down — it seemed to 
Hugh that the torture had been 
going on for weeks but his watch 
showed that Karen had been in labor 
eighteen hours — Barbara said ur- 
gently, “Hugh, she can’t take any 
more.” 

“I know,” he admitted, looking 
at his daughter. She was at the peak 
of a pain, face gray and contorted, 
mouth squared in agony, high sob- 
bing moans filling the room.

•*Well? We have to do something.” 
“I suppose she should have had 
a Caesarean But I’m no surgeon.” 
“I wonder.” 

“I don’t. I’m not.” 

‘^You know more about it than 
the first man who ever did one! 
You know how to keep it sterile. 
We have sulfa drugs and you can 
load her up with demerol.” She did 
not try to keep Karen from hear- 
ing; their patient was beyond car- 
ing. 

“No.” 

“Hugh, you must. She’s dying.” 

“I know.” He sighed. “But it’s too 
late for a Caesarean, even if I knew 
how. To save Karen with one, I 
mean. We might save her baby.” 
He blinked and swayed. “Only it 
would not. Who*s to wet-nurse? You 
can’t, not yet. And cows we don’t 
have.” 

He took a deep breath, tried to 
get a grip on himself. “Only one 
thing left. Try to get it out Eskimo 
style.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Get her up and let gravity help. 
Maybe it’ll work. Call the boys, 
we’ll need them. I’ve got to scrub 
again; I might have to do an episi- 
otomy. Oh, God.” 

Five minutes and two contrac- 
tions later they were ready to try it. 
When Karen lay back exhausted 
after the second one, Hugh tried 
to explain what they were going to 
do. It was hard to get her attention. 

At last she nodded slightly and 
whispered, “I don’t care.” 

Hugh went to the table where his 
equipment was now opened out, and 
got his one scalpel, took the camp 



lamp in his other hand. ‘*AI1 right, 
boys. As soon as she starts, pick 
her up.” 

They had only seconds to wait. 
Hugh saw the contraction start, nod- 
ded to Duke. “Nowl” 

“With me, Joe.” They started to 
lift her, each with an arm under 
her back, a hand under a thigh. 

Karen screamed and fought them 
off. “No, no! Don’t touch me — 
/ can*t stand it! Daddy, make them 
stop! DaddyV* 

They stopped. Duke said, “Dad?” 
“Lift her up! Now!” 

They got her high in a squatting 
position, thighs pulled open. Bar- 
bara got behind Karen, arms around 
her, and pressed down on the girl’s 
tortured belly. Karen screamed and 
struggled; they held her fast. 

Hugh barely had time to get to the 
floor before he had both hands full 
of wet, slippery, bloody baby. He 
knew there was something else he 
should do now but all he could 
think of was to get it by both feet in 
his left hand, lift it and slap its 
tiny bottom. 

It let out a choked wail. 

“Get her on the bed, boys — but 
easy! It’s still fastened by the cord.” 
They made it, Hugh on his knees 
and burdened with a feebly wiggling 
load. Once they had Karen down, 
Hugh started to put her baby in 
her arms — but saw that Karen was 
not up to it. She seemed to be awake. 
Her eyes were open. But she was in 
total collapse. 

H ugh was close to collapse. He 
looked dazedly around, handed 
the baby to Barbara. “Stay close.”

IF 




“Dad?” said Duke. “Aren’t you 
supposed to cut the cord?” 

“Not yet.” Where was that knife? 
He found it, rubbed it quickly with 
iodine — hoped that it was sterile. 
Placed it by two boiled lengths of 
cotton string — turned and felt the 
cord to see if it was pulsing. 

“He’s beautiful,” Joe said softly. 
“She,” Hugh corrected. “The baby 
is a girl. Now, Barbara, if you — ” 
He broke off. Suddenly every- 
thing happened too fast. The baby 
started to choke; Hugh grabbed it, 
turned it upside down, dug into its 
mouth, scooped out a plug of mucus, 
handed the baby back, started again 
to check the cord — saw that Karen 
was in trouble. 

With a nightmare feeling that he 
needed to be twins he got one of the 
strings, tied a square knot around 
the cord near the baby’s belly, trying 
to control his trembling so as not to 
tie it too hard — started to tie the 
second, saw that it was not needed; 

FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



Karen suddenly delivered the pla 
centa and was hemorrhaging. She 
moaned. 

With one slash Hugh cut the cord 
snapped at Barbara, “Get a bell> 
band on it!” — turned to take care 
of the mother. 

She was flowing like a river; her 
face was gray and she seemed lui' 
conscious. Too late to attempt tc 
take stitches. This flood was from in- 
side. He tried to stop it by packing 
her with their last roll of gauze while 
shouting to Joe and to Duke to ge 
a belly band compress on Karen 
himself to put pressure on her uter 
us. 

Some agonized time later tfu 
belly compress was in place. Hugh 
raised his eyes and looked at Karen’s 
face — then in sudden panic tric( 
to find her pulse. 

Karen had survived the birth 
her daughter by less than sever 
minutes. The child lingered for a 
few hours, then joined her.

T hey went on. Duke hunted, 
Duke and Joe farmed, Hugh 
worked harder than ever. Grace 
worked, too, and her cooking im- 
proved — and her eating; she got 
fatter. She never mentioned her con- 
viction that her husband had been 
responsible for the death of their 
daughter. 

She did not speak to him at all. 
When a problem had to be discussed 
she spoke to Duke. She quit attend- 
ing even their church services. 

In the last month of Barbara’s 
pregnancy Duke sought out nis fa- 
ther, privately. “Dad, you told me 
that any time I wanted to leave — 
or any of us — we could.” 

Hugh was startled. “Yes.” 

“A pro-rata share, you said. Am- 
mo, tools, and so forth.” 

“Better than that; we’re a going 
concern. Duke, you are leaving?” 
“Yes — but not just myself. Moth- 
er wants to. She’s the one who’s 
dead set on it. I’ve got reasons, but 
Mother’s wishes are the deciding 
factor.” 

“Mmm. Let’s talk about your rea- 
sons. Are you dissatisfied with the 
way I’m running things? I will glad- 
ly step aside. I feel sure that I can 
get Joe and Barbara to go along, so 



that you will have unanimous sup- 
port.” He sighed. “I am anxious to 
turn over the burden.” 

Duke shook his head. “That’s not 
it, Dad. I don’t want to be boss and 
you’ve done a good job. Oh, I won’t 
say I liked the high-handed way you 
started in. But results count and you 
got results. I’d rather not discuss my 
reasons except to say that they don’t 
have to do with you — and wouldn’t 
be enough to make me leave if 
Mother weren’t hipped on it. She 
wants to leave. She’s going to leave. 
I can’t let her leave alone.” 

Hugh pondered it. “Duke, if that’s 
how your mother feels, I won’t try 
to persuade her; I’ve long since lost 
my influence over her. But I have 
two ideas. You may find one of 
them practical.” 

“I doubt it.” 

“Hear me. You know we have 
copper tubing; we used some in the 
kitchen. We have everything for a 
still; I stocked the items to build 
one if a war came along — not just 
for us but because liquor is money 
in any primitive society. 

“I haven’t built it for reasons we 
both know. But I could and I know 
how to make liquor.” He smiled 
slightly. “Not book knowledge. 
While I was in the South Pacific, I 
bossed a still, with the shut-eye con- 
nivance of my C. O. I learned how 
to turn corn or potatoes or most 
anything into vodka, or fruit into 
brandy. Duke your mother might be 
happy if she had liquor. 

“She would drink herself to 
death!” 

“Duke, Duke! If she is happy do- 
ing it, who are we to stop her? 



72 



IF 




What does she have to live for? She 
loved television, she enjoyed parties, 
she could spend a happy day at the 
hairdresser’s, followed by a movie, 
then drinks with one of her friends. 
That was her life, Duke. Now where 
is it? Gone, gone! There is just this 
we can give her to make up for 
what she has lost. Who are you to 
decide that your mother must not 
drink herself to death?” 

“Dad, that’s not the situation!” 
“So?” 

“You know I don’t — didn’t — 
approve of Mother’s excessive 
drinking. But I might go along with 
letting her drink all she wants now. 
If you build that still, we might be 
customers. But we would still leave. 
Because that won’t solve Mother’s 
problem.” 

“Well, Duke, that leaves only my 
other idea. I’ll get out instead. 
Only — ” Hugh frowned. “Duke, tell 
her that I will leave as soon as Bar- 
bara has her baby. I can’t walk out 
on my patient. You can give Grace 
my assur — ” 

“Dad, that won’t solve a thing!” 
“I don’t understand.” 

4 4/^h, Christ, I might as well 
vy spill it. It’s Barbara, She’s — 
Well, hell. Mother is nuts on the 
subject. Can’t stand her. Ever since 
Karen died.” 

“Good Lord!” 

“Yeah. I tried to reason with her. 
I told her that Barbara couldn’t 
leave. So she decided to leave. I 
can’t stall her any longer. She’s leav- 
ing. I’m going with her, to take care 
of her.” 

His father rubbed his temples, “I 



guess there is no situation so bad but 
what it can get worse. Duke, even 
with you, she hasn’t anywhere to 
go.” 

“Not quite. Dad.” 

“Eh?” 

“I can swing it, with your help. 
Do you remember that cave up Col- 
lins Canyon, the one they tried to 
make a tourist attraction? It’s stifl 
there. Or its twin, I mean. I was 
hunting up that way that first week. 
The canyon looked so familiar that 
I climbed up and looked for the 
cave. Found it. And Dad, it’s hab- 
itable and defensible.” 

“The door? The mouth?” 

“No problem. If you can spare 
that steel plate that blocked off the 
tunnel.” 

“Certainly.” 

“The cave has a vent, higher up. 
No smoke problem. It has a spring 
that hasn’t failed all this dry weath- 
er. Dad, it’s as comfortable as the 
shelter; all it needs is outfitting.” 

“I capitulate. You can take almost 
anything now. Beds, of course. Uten- 
sils. Your pick of the canned goods. 
Matches, ammunition, guns. Make a 
list. I’ll help you move.” 

Duke colored under his tan. “Dad, 
a few things are up there already.” 
“So? Did you think I would be 
pinchpenny?” 

“Uh ... I don’t mean the past few 
days. I moved some things up the 
first days we were here. You see . 
well, you and I had that row — and 
then you made me rationing officer. 
That gave me the idea, and for a 
week or more I always left here 
loaded, leaving when no one was 
watching.”

^Stealing," said Hugh tightly. 

“I didn’t figure it so. 1 never took 
as much as one sixth of anything. 
and just stuff I would have to have 
in a pinch. Matches. Ammo. That 
rifle you couldn’t find. One blanket. 
A knife. A little food. Some candles. 
You see . well, look at it from my 
side. There was aways the chance 
that I woud get you sore and either 
have to fight — one of us killed is 
the way you put it — or run and 
not be able to stop for anything. I 
decided not to fight. So I made 
preparations. But I didn’t steal it; 
you said I could have it. Say the 
word and I’ll fetch it all back.” 

Hugh Farnham peeled a callus, 
then looked up. “One man’s stealing 
is another man’s survival, I suppose. 
Just one thing — Duke, in that food 
you took: Were there any cans of 
milk?” 

‘‘Not one. Dad, don’t you think,* 
if there had been, I would have 
beaten all records getting up there 
and back when Karen died?” 

“Yes. I’m sorry I asked.” 

“I was sorry I hadn’t snitched a 
few cans; then they wouldn’t have 
been used up.” 

“The baby didn’t last out the milk 
we had, Duke. All right, it calls for 
quick surgery — but don’t forget 
that you can come back, any time. 
Duke, women sometimes get un- 
reasonable at about your mother’s 
age . then get over it and are nice 
old ladies. Maybe we’ll have the 
family together again. I hope we’ll 
see you occasionally. You’re wel- 
come to all the vegetables you can 
eat, of course.” 

“I was going to mention that. I 



can’t farm up there. Suppose I st9 
hunt for all of us . .and when I 
bring in a load of meat I take away 
a load of green stuff.” 

His father smiled. “We have rein- 
stituted commerce. And we can sup- 
ply you with pottery and there’s n# 
need to do your own tanning. Duke, 
I suggest you sort out what you 
want, and tomorrow you and I and 
Joe will start packing it to your cave. 
Be lavish. Just one thing — ” 
“What?” 

“The books are mine! Anything 
you want to look up, you’ll have to 
come here. This is not a circulating 
library.” 

“Fair enough.” 

“I mean it. You can have my 
razor, you can have my best knife. 
But snitch one book and I’ll skin 
you alive and bind that book in hu- 
man skin. There are limits. All right, 
I’ll tell Joe, and get Barbara out of 
the house and we’ll stay away until 
dark. Good luck, and tell Grace no 
hard feelings. There are, but tell her 
that. But I’m not too groused. It 
takes two to create a heaven . 
but hell can be accomplished by 
one. I can’t say that I’ve been happy 
lately and Grace may be smarter 
than we think.” 

A bout nine the next morning, 
they all were outside where 
chattels for the new household were 
piled. 

Hugh looked over his ex-wife’s se- 
lections with wry amusement. Grace 
had taken literally the invitation to 
“take almost anything;” she had gut- 
ted the place — the best blankets, 
almost all utensils including the tea

IF 




kettle and the one skillet, three of 
four foam-rubber mattresses, nearly 
all the remaining canned goods, all 
the sugar, the lion’s share of other 
irreplaceables, all the plastic dishes. 

Hugh made only one objection: 
salt. When he noted that Grace had 
grabbed all the salt he insisted on a 
division. Duke agreed and asked if 
there was anything else Hugh ob- 
jected to? 

Hugh shook his head. Barbara 
would not mind making-do. ^'Better 
is a dinner of herbs where love 
is — ” 

Duke had shown restraint, taking 
one shovel, one axe, a hammer, less 
than half the nails, and no tool not 
stocked in duplicate. Instead Duke 
remarked that he might want to bor- 
row tools someday. Hugh agreed 
and offered his services on any two- 
man job. Duke thanked him. Both 
men found the situation embarrass- 
ing, both were unusually polite. 

A delay in starting was caused by 
the steel plate for the cave door. Its 
weight was not too great for a man 
as husky as Duke, but it was awk- 
ward. A pack had to be devised, 
rugged enough for the trek, com- 
fortable in padding and straps, and 
so rigged that Duke could fire a 
rifle. 

This resulted in sacrificing the 
one intact bear hide, the covering of 
the bed Karen had died in. Hugh 
minded only the loss of time. It 
would take six trips by three men to 
move the plunder Grace had picked; 
Duke thought that two trips a day 
would be maximum. If they did not 
start soon, only one trip could be 
made that day. 



At last they got it on Duke’s back 
with a fur pad protecting his spine. 
“Feels right,” Duke decided. “Letli 
get packs on you two and get go- 
ing.” 

“In a jiffy,” Hugh agreed and bent 
over to pick up his load. 

“My God!” 

“Trouble, Duke?” 

“Look!” 

A shape had appeared over the 
eastern rise. It slanted through the 
air on a course that would have 
missed Ijiem, but, as it neared the 
point of closest approach, it stopped 
dead, turned and headed for them. 

K passed majestically overhead. 
Hugh was unable to guess its size at 
first; there was nothing to which to 
relate it — a dark shape propw- 
tioned like a domino tile. But, as it 
passed about five hundred feet up, 
k seemed to him that it was around 
a hundred feet wide and three timet 
that in length. He could make out 
no features. It moved swiftly but 
made no noise. 

It swept past, turned, circled — 
stopped, turned again and came to- 
ward them at lower altitude. 

H ugh found that he had an 
arm around Barbara. When the 
object had appeared, she had been 
some distance away, putting clothet 
to soak in the outside tub. Now sho 
was circled by his left arm and he 
could feel her trembling. 

“Hugh, what is it?” 

“People.” 

The thing hovered above thefr 
flag. Now they could see people; 
heads showed above Its sides. 

A comer detached itself, splitting

fi 




off sharply. It dove, stopped by the 
peak of the flag pole. Hugh saw that 
it was a car about nine feet long and 
three wide, with one passenger. No 
details could he see, no clue to mo- 
tive power; the car enclosed the 
man’s lower body; his trunk pro- 
jected above. 

The man removed the flag, re- 
joined the main craft. His vehicle 
blended back in. 

The rectangle disintegrated. 

It broke into units like that which 
had filched their flag. Most cars re- 
mained in the air; some dozen land- 
ed, three in a triangle around the 
colonists. Duke yelled, “Watch it!” 
and dived for his gun. 

He never made it. He leaned for- 
ward at an extreme angle, pawed 
the air with a look of amazement, 
and was slowly pulled back to ver- 
tical. 

Barbara gasped in Hugh’s ear. 
“Hugh, what is it?” 

“I don’t know.” He did not need 
to ask what she meant; he had felt, 
the instant his son was stopped, that 
he seemed to be waist deep in quick- 
sand. “Don’t fight it.” 

“I wasn’t going to.” 

Grace shrilled, “Hubert! Hubert, 
do some — ” Her cries cut off. She 



seemed to faint but did not fall. 

Four cars were about eight feet in 
the air, lined up abreast, and were 
cruising over Barbara’s farm. V.^ere 
^ey passed, everything underneath, 
corn stalks, tomato plants, beans, 
squash, lettuce, potato hills, every- 
thing including branching ditches 
was pressed fat into a macadam. 

The raw end of -he main ditch 
spilled water over this pavement. 
One car whipped around, ran a new 
ditch around the raped area in a 
wide sweep which allowed the water 
to cirde the destroyed garden and 
reach the stream at a lower point. 

O ut of the pavilion strode a man. 

He seemed seven feet tall 
but some of this was a helmet, 
plumed and burnished. He wore a 
flowing skirt of red embroidered in 
gold and was bare to the waist save 
that an end of the skirt thrown 
across one shoulder covered part of 
his broad chest. He had an air of 
good-natured arrogance and his eyes 
were bright and merry. His forehead 
was high, his skull massive; he 
looked intelligent and alert. Hugh 
could not place his race. His skin 
was dark brown and shiny. But his 
mouth was only slightly Negroid;

Ms nose, though broad, was arched, 
and his black hair was wavy. 

He carried a small crop. 

He strode up to them, stopped 
abruptly when he reached Joseph. 
He gave a curt order to their near- 
est captor. 

Joe stretched and bent his legs. 
“Thanks.” 

The man spoke to Joe. Joe an- 
swered, “Sorry, I don’t understand.” 

The man spoke again. Joe 
shrugged helplessly. The man 
grinned and patted him on the shoul- 
der, turned away, picked up Duke’s 
rifle. He handled it clumsily, making 
Hugh flinch. 

Nevertheless he seemed to under- 
stand guns. He worked the bolt, 
ejecting one cartridge, then put it to 
his shoulder, aimed and fired. 

The blast was deafening, he had 
fired past Hugh’s ear. He grinned 



bioadly, tossed the rifle to a subor- 
itinate, walked up to Hugh and Bar- 
bara, reached out to touch Barbara’s 
diild-swollen belly. 

Hugh knocked his hand away. 
With a gesture almost negligent, 
certainly without anger, the big man 
brushed Hugh’s hand aside with the 
crop he carried. It was not a blow, 
it would not have swatted a fly. 

Hugh gasped in agony. His hand 
burned like fire and his arm was 
numb to the armpit. “Oh, God!” 
Barbara said urgently, “Don’t, 
Hugh. He isn’t hurting me.” 

Nor was he. With a manner of 
impersonal interest such as a veter- 
inarian might take in feeling a preg- 
nant mare or bitch, the big man felt 
out the shape of the child she car- 
ried — while Hugh writhed in that 
special humiliation of a man unable 
to protect his woman.

IF • Short St^ 



WEETL 



BY JACK SHARKEY 



His purposes were pure. 
His method was correct. 
His end was appaUing! 



G regory Swenn’^ basic problem 
was the manner of his rearing. 
Brought up by doting parents who 
— as a business — spent most of 
their time upon soapboxes on street 
corners exhorting passersby to “Re- 
pent before.it is too late!”, young 
Gregory’s view of life was apt to 
become a bit “slanted” as he grew 
up, a situation which his proud pa- 
rents might have foretold had they 
realized the significance of his first 
spoken word, at the age of eight 
months. Some children began their 
communicative careers with “ma- 
ma”, others with “dada”, and a few 



scions whose ancestry could be 
traced directly to certain promin- 
ent brokerage firms began their 
primal conversation by murmurring 
“money”; but young Gregory 
Swenn’s first word was “Shame!” 

By the age of three, his vocabu- 
lary had improved to the extent of 
including innumerable cautionary 
expressions of the “Beware!”, “Look 
out!” and “Consider!” genre, so that 
an hour spent in his urgently lisping 
company could reduce a steel-nerved 
stevedore to a whimpering jelly. 

By age five, Gregory had pro- 
gressed far enough in intelligence to 

78 



karn what this vocabulary referred 
to. It was then that he made his 
historic decision to devote his life 
to the same goals toward which his 
parents aimed. 

Gregory, however, decided upon 
a more direct route. 

After a reasonably normal ap- 
prenticeship in elementary and high 
schools (during the course of which 
Gregory spent most of his free time 
patrolling the streets with his pock- 
ets full of blackboard erasers and 
soap, to undo the damages wrought 
by other young men his age who 
wandered about practicing their 
calligraphy with colored chalk up- 
on fences, sidewalks, and the walls 
of public washrooms), it came time 
to enter a university, a luxury Greg- 
ory could well afford, since — when 
his parents and himself were en- 
gaged in passing the hat after a 
lecture — he employed a ten-gallon 
Stetson with a false bottom. His 
doting parents asked him whether 
he would major in Basic Apologet- 
ics, or simply strive for a D. D. 
Gregory shocked these humble pur- 
veyors of righteousness by announc- 
ing, ‘‘I could learn, in either pro- 
gram, nothing which I already do 
not know. Therefore I intend to 
pursue a strict, concentrated major 
— without electives or minors, 
hence not terminating in a degree, 
but that is a small matter — in the 
relatively untapped field of En- 
cephalic Phonology!” 

His parents, though quite poor, 
were quite illiterate also. Assuming 
his statement to be a sophisticated 
utilization of foul language, they 
disowned him on the spot and 



hacked his soapbox into kindling. 
Undaunted, Gregory entered tlM 
university and began to learn for 
all he was worth. 

At the end of four years Greg- 
ory, now a pinch-faced, purse-lipped 
man of twenty-two years, had learnt 
all he needed to know on the sub- 
ject. Quietly removing himself from 
the campus one night, he moved 
into a city apartment and began th« 
construction of his famous Enceph- 
alophonolabialternater, a sort ol 
rfiortwave radio transmitter attuned 
to the frequencies of the humaa 
brain in the neuronic area con- 
trolling the use of lips, larynx, 
tongue, teeth and diaphragm. 

I n short, Gregory now could 
— ^by the simple adjustment of a 
dial — control the speech habits ol 
aU the people in the entire world. 

However, his scheme had ono 
flaw. Whereas he had hoped to en- 
tirely eliminate all profanity, vu^ 
garity, swearing, cursing and asso- 
ciated coarsenesses from humaa 
speech, leaving in their place a rest- 
ful silence, he found that nature — 
as usual abhorring a vacuum — 
compromised to the extent of a 
substitute sound. This was a breathy 
vocalization quite close to a burbly 
whistle (such as those used by traf- 
fic policemen and camp counselors), 
which emerged from the lips of tha 
speaker in syllables that seemed ta 
say ‘‘weetl”. 

‘‘Well,” sighed Gregory, “it is bai- 
ter than nothing, I guess. At least 
the words of the world will ba 
cleansed of decadent degradations." 
So saying, he plugged his ma- 



WEETL 



ff 




chine into the wall outlet, set the 
dial and turned it on. Then, lock- 
ing up the apartment, he set forth 
to stroll the streets of the city and 
see his tongue-tied utopia begin to 
bloom. 

Rounding a corner, Gregory 
chanced to collide with a gorilla- 
like male who was three days un- 
shaven, and wearing workman’s 
clothing and a sour expression. “I 
beg your pardon,” said Gregory, 
who was always extra-polite to peo- 
ple greater in size than himself. 

‘‘Wyncha watch where the weetl 
you’re goin’I” the man demanded, 
before shuffling off down the street. 
To his shift in speech mannerism 
he apparently paid no heed. Greg- 
ory stared after the man, bemused. 

‘Tt may be,” he said to himself, 
‘‘that people have become so inured 
to the use of profanity that the 
words have quite lost meaning for 
them.” This bothered him terribly. 

“Little good it does,” he pon- 
dered, “to eliminate the actual 
words, when the ‘weetle’ sound 
serves them as well!” He turned 
about and began hurrying back to- 
ward his apartment. There he dis- 
covered that he could not admit 
himself onto the premises, having 
unaccountably lost his wallet, his 
keys and one slightly used hanker- 
chief. Then he recalled his encoun- 
ter with the gorilla-like man, and 
the hasty manner in which the man 
had departed after the collision, 
not pausing to remonstrate nor re- 
sort to fisticuffs. “But,” Gregory 
thought miserably, “I thought pick- 
pockets were all small weasel-faced 
men who performed their art dur- 



ing parade and subway crushes!^ 
Disillusioned at this betrayal from 
a fellow man, Gregory began to 
thrust his inadequate shoulder 
against the door of his apartment, 
but it would not move. However, 
his efforts made sufficient commo- 
tion to incur the attentions of the 
building superintendent, who came 
upstairs on the run. 

“Weetl-o, Mr. Swenn,” said the 
man, seeing him there in the corri- 
dor. “Can I be of some weetl p?” 
“Dear me!” gasped Gregory. 
“Even the innocent words are suf- 
fering. I thought my machine had 
more sense!” He clutched the super- 
intendent by the suspenders. “You 
must unlock my door with your 
passkey,” he pled, “lest it turn out 
that my efforts have done naught 
but supply the world with an all- 
purpose cuss-word!” 

“Why is your brow so weetlp with 
sweat?” inquired the man, prying 
Gregory’s fingers from their elas- 
tic supports. “I’d expect such hys- 
teria in a woman, but not in a per- 
son of the opposite weetl.” 

“Open the door!” Gregory 
begged, weeping. “The machine is 
gaining on us! I had set the dial 
merely to block out the word 
‘weetl’, but now it has advanced to 
the blockade of ‘weetl’ and ‘weed’, 
besides!” 

The superintendent stared blank- 
ly. “Maybe you’d better weetl down, 
Mr. Swenn,” he suggested. “I mean 
it most weetlcerely,” he added. 

G regory staggered back horrified 
at the progress his machine 
was making. Soon, he realized, it 



80 



IF 




could be beyond the efforts of a 
person to order a weetinamon bun 
with his morning coffee! He stag- 
gered back even further as he re- 
alized that his very mind had been 
invaded by the onslaught of the 
machine. He could not so much as 
think of words like “weetr* any 
more, let alone terms like “weetl” 
or ‘Veetl”! Maddened he raced 
downstairs and into the street. 

He sprang into his car, stepped 
on the weed (the machine was 
against mention of intimate alimen- 
tary disorders), and let out the 
weed (against physical violations, 
also), then drove out toward the 
weed, whose stored-up reservoir 
provided the hydroelectric power 
that was even now running his ma- 
chine. Not waiting for the green, 
he drove right through a weed 



weed at the intersection, and soon 
had a trail of angry motorcycle 
policemen following close weed 
him. But he arrived at the weed 
before they did, and raced for the 
entrance. But a spillage of water 
had weetlpened the weed, and 
Gregory, weetlpless to stop, fell 
weetlter-skelter off the front of the 
weetl into the turbines and was 
crushed to a pulp. 

By the time the untended ma- 
chine had burnt itself out, the word 
‘Veetr’ remained in the language as 
a verbal monument to its inventor, 
Gregory Swenn, who had by his 
efforts supplied the speaking world 
with a term used to reto to things 
so debased and unspeakable they 
had hitherto been even beyond the 
frank discussion of determined de- 
generates. END

Yet it would be unfair to say that his book is 
no more than a collection of topological recre-

The 

Mathenaufs 



IF • N9Mi0t$0 



BY NORMAN KAGAN 

lUUSTRATED BY MODEL 



I 

I t happened on my fifth trip in- 
to the spaces, and the first ever 
made under the private enterprise 
acts. It took a long time to get the 
P.E.A. through Congress for mathe- 
nautics, but the precedents went all 
the .way back to the Telstar satel- 
lite a hundred years ago, and most 
of the concepts are in books anyone 
can buy, though not so readily un- 
derstand. Besides, it didn’t matter if 
BC-flight was made public or not. 



They sailed the star lanes In a 
mathematical abstraction^and 
reached an unbelievable goal! 



All mathenauts are crazy. Every- 
body knows that. 

Take our crew. Johnny Pearl took 
a pin along whenever he went baby- 
sitting for the grad students at 
Berkeley, and three months later the 
mothers invariably found out they 
were pregnant again. And Pearl was 
our physcist. 

Then there was Goldwasser. Ed 
Goldwasser always sits in those 
pan-on-a-post cigarette holders when 
we’re in New York, and if you ask 
him, he grumbles; “Well, its an ash- 



82 



iniy, ain*t k?” A punster aM 
a pataphysicist. I would never halve 
chosen him to go, except tfaH he 
and I got the idea together, so I 
couldn’t say no. 

Ted Anderson was our meta- 
mathematician. He’s about half a 
nanosecond behind Ephriam Cohen 
(the co-inventor of BC-flight) and 
has about six nervous breakdowns a 
month trying to pass him. But he’s 
got the best practical knowledge of 
the BC-drive outside Princeton, if 
practical knowledge means anything 
with respect to a pure mathematical 
abstraction. 

And me — topologist. A topolo- 
gist is a man who can’t tell a dough- 
nut from a cup of coffee. (I’ll ex- 
plain that some other time.) Serious- 
ly, I specialize in some of the more 
abstruse properties of geometric 
structures. “Did Galois discover that 
theorem before or after he died?” 
is a sample of my conversation. 

Sure, mathenauts are mathenuts. 
But as we found out, not quite 
mathenutty enough. 

The ship, the Abrecht Dold, was 
a twelve googol scout that Ed Gold- 
wasser and I’d picked up cheap 
from the N.Y.U. Courant Mathe- 
matical Sciences Institute. She 
wasn’t the Princeton I.A.S. Von- 
Neumann, with googolplex coils and 
a chapter of the D.A.R., and she 
wasn’t one of those new toys you’ve 
been seeing for a rich man and his 
grandmother. Her coils were DNA 
molecules, and the psychosomatics 
were straight from the Brill Institute 
at Harvard. A sweet ship. For psy- 
chic ecology we’d gotten a bunch of 
kids from the Bronx College of the 



New York City University, com- 
monsense types — business majors, 
engineers, pre-meds. But kids. 

I was looking over Ephraim Co- 
hen’s latest paper. Nymphomaniac 
Nested Complexes With Rossian Ir- 
revelancies (old Ice Cream Cohen 
loves sexy titles), when the trouble 
started. We’d abstracted, and Gold- 
wasser and Pearl had signalled me 
from the lab that they were ready 
for the first tests. I made the Dold 
invariant, and shoved off through 
one of the passages that linked the 
isomorphomechanism and the lab. 
(We kept the ship in free fall for 
convenience). I was about half way 
along the tube when the immy failed 
and the walls began to close in. 

S omeone (probably me) had 

scavenged the grablines to cut 
up for extra connectivity. I spread 
my legs and braked against the walls 
of the tube, believing with all my 
might. On second thought I let the 
walls sink in and braked with my 
palms. It would’ve been no trick to 
hold the walls for awhile. Without 
the immy my own imagination 
would hold them, this far from the 
B.C.N.Y. kids. But that might’ve 
brought more trouble — I’d prob- 
ably made some silly mistake, and 
the kids, who might not notice a 
simple contraction or shear, would 
crack up under some weirdomor- 
phism. And if we lost the kids . 

So anyway I just dug my feet in 
against the mirage and tried to slow 
up, on a surface that no one’d both- 
ered to think any friction into. Of 
course, if you’ve read some of the 
popular accounts of math-sailing. 



THE MATHENAUTS

you*d think Td fust duck back 
through a hcikt m the fiftieth dimen- 
sion to the immy. But it doesn’t 
work out that way. A ship in BC- 
flight is a very precarious structure 
in a philosophical sense. That’s why 
we carry a psychic ecology, and 
that’s why Brill conditioning takes 
six years, plus with a Ph.D. in pure 
math, to absorb. As it was, there 
weren’t a hundred mathenauts yet, 
and we’d been lucky to get Pearl 
and Anderson, despite their person- 
alities. An)Tway, a mathenaut should 
never forget his postulates, or he’ll 
find himself floating in 27-space, 
with nary a notion to be named. 

Then the walls really did vanish 
— NO! — and I found myself at the 
junction of two passages. The other 
had a grabline. I caught it and re- 
bounded, then swarmed back along 
the tube to the control room. 

About then the walls really did 
begin to cave in, till after ten sec- 
onds I was climbing down into a 
funnel. I caught my breath, swal- 
lowed some Dramamine, and burst 
into the control room. 

The heart of the ship was pulsing 
and throbbing. For a moment I 
thought I was back in Hawaii with 
my aqualung, an invader in a shift- 
ing, shimmering world of sea fronds 
and barracuda. But it was no immy, 
no immy — a rubber room without 
the notion of distance that we take 
for granted (technically, a room 
with topological properties but no 
metric ones). To my eyes, it was as 
if everything had been transmuted 
to the finest, most pliable rubber, 
and chose to shift or swell as my 
gaze met it. Instrument racks and 



diairs and books sbnuik aad bd> 

looned and twisted, and floor and 
ceiling vibrated with my breath. Ik 
was as if 1 had to keep thinking 
about everything for it to remain 
still. 

It was horrible. 

Ted Anderson was hanging in 
front of the immy, the isomorpho- 
mechanism, but he was in no shape 
to do anything. In fact, he was in no 
shape at all. His body was pulsing 
and throbbing and shaking, so his 
hands were too big or too small to 
manipulate the controls, or his eyes 
shrank or blossomed. Poor Ted’s 
nerves had gone again. 

I shoved against the wall and bul- 
leted toward him, a fish in a weav- 
ing, shifting undersea landscape, 
concentrating desperately on my 
body and the old structure of the 
room. (This is why physical training 
is so important). For an instant I 
was choking and screaming in a 
hairy blackness, a nightmare inside- 
out total inversion; then I was back 
in the control room, and had shoved 
Ted away from the instruments, 
cursing when nothing happened, 
then bracing against the wall panels 
and shoving again. He drifted away. 

The immy was all right. The 
twiddles circuits between the 
B.C.N.Y kids and the rest of the 
Dold had been cut out. I set up an 
orthonormal system and punched 
the immy. 

Across the shuddering, shifting 
room Ted tried to speak, but found 
it too difficult. Great Gauss, he was 
lucky his aorta hadn’t contracted to 
a straw and given him a coronary! 
I clamped down on my own circu- 



84 



IF 




latory system viciously, while he 
struggled to speak. Finally 
he kicked off and came tumbling to- 
ward me, mouthing and flailing his 
notebook. 

I hit the circuit. The room shifted 
about and for an instant Ted An- 
derson hung, ghostly, amid the iso- 
morphomechanism’s one - to - ones. 
He disappeared! 

II 

T he invention of BC-flight was 
the culmination of a century of 
work in algebraic topology and ex- 
perimental psychology. For thou- 
sands of years men had speculated 
as to the nature of the world. For 
the past five hundred, physics and 
the physical sciences had held sway. 
Then Thomas Brill and Ephraim 
Cohen peeled away another layer 
of the reality onion, and the spaces- 
sciences came into being. 

If you insist on an analogy — 
well, a scientist touches and probes 
the real universe, and abstracts an 
idealization into his head. Mathe- 
nautics allows him to grab himself 
by the scruff of the neck and pull 
himself up into the idealization. See 
— I told you. 

Okay, we’ll try it slowly. Science 
assumes the universe to be ordered, 
and investigates the nature of the 
ordering. In the “hard” sciences, 
mathematics is the basis of the or- 
dering the scientist puts' on nature. 
By the twentieth century, a large 
portion of the physical processes 
and materials in the universe were 
found to submit to such an ordering 
(e.g.: analytic mechanics and the 



motions of the planets). Some sci- 
entists were even applying mathe- 
matical structures to aggregates of 
living things, and to living processes. 

Cohen and Brill asked (in ways 
far apart), “If order and organiza- 
tion seem to be a natural part of 
the universe, why can’t we remove 
these qualities from coarse matter 
and space, and study them separ- 
ately?” The answer was BC-flight. 

Through certain purely mathe- 
matical “mechanisms” and special 
psychological training, selected sci- 
entists (the term “mathenaut” came 
later, slang from the faddy “astro- 
nautics” that was current at the 
time), could be shifted into the ab- 
stract. 

The first mathenautical ships 
were crewed with young scientists 
and mathematicians who’d received 
Tom Brill’s treatments and Ephraim 
Cohen’s skullcracking sessions on 
the BC-field. The ships went into 
BC-flight and vanished. 

By the theory, the ships didn’t go 
anywhere. But the effect was some- 
how real. Just as a materialist might 
see organic machines instead of peo- 
ple, so, multiplied a millionfold, the 
mathenauts saw the raw mathemat- 
ical structure of space — Riemann 
space, Hausdorf space, vector space 
— without matter. A crowd of peo- 
ple existed as an immensely compli- 
cated something in vector space. 
The study of these somethings wae 
yielding immense amounts of 
knowledge. Pataphysics, pataso- 
ciology, patapsychology were wild, 
baffling new fields of knowledge. 

But the math universes were 
strange, alien. How could you learn

to live in Flatland? The wildcat 
Blinds of the first crews were too 
creative. They become disoriented. 
Hence the immies (short for iso- 
morphomechanisms) and their pow-

SayCows, DaughtAmRevs, the 
B.C.N.Y. kids — fatheads, stuffed 
Airts, personality types that clung to 
commonsense where there was 
none, and preserved (locally) a 
riiip’s psychic ecology. Inside the 
BC-field, normalcy. Outside, raw 
knagination. 

Johnny, Ted, Goldy and I had 
ckosen vector spaces with certain 
loplogical properties to test Goldy’s 
commercial concept. Outside the 
BC-field there was dimension but no 
distance, structure but no shape. In- 
fide — 

iiT^y Riemann’s tensorsP Pearl 

-D cried. 

He was at the iris of one of the 
tobes. A moment later Ed Goldwas- 
8er joined him. ‘‘What happened to 
Ted?” 

“I — I donH know. No — yes I 
do!” 

I released the controls I had on 
my body, and stopped thinking 
about the room. The immy was 
working again. “He was doing some- 
thing with the controls when the 
twiddles circuits failed. When I got 
diem working again and the room 
mapped back into shape, he hap- 
pened to be where the immy had 
been. The commonsense circuits re- 
jected him.” 

“So where did he go?” asked 
Pearl. 

“I don’t know." 



I was sweating. I wai diiakhig of 
all the things that could’ve happened 
when we lost the isomorphomech- 
anism. Some subconscious twitch 
and you’re rotated half a dozen di- 
mensions out of phase, so you’re 
floating in the raw stuff of thought, 
with maybe a hair-thin line around 
you to tell you where the ship has 
been, or maybe two polar dots. Or 
the ship takes the notion to shrink 
pea-size, so you’re squeezed through 
all the tubes and compartments and 
smashed to jelly when we orthonor- 
malize. Galois! We’d been lucky. 

The last thought gave me a no- 
tion “Could we have shrunk so we’re 
inside his body? Or he grown so 
we’re floating in his liver?” 

“No,” said Goldy. “Topology is 
preserved. But I don’t — or, hell — 
I really don’t know. If he grew so 
big he was outside the psychic ecol- 
ogy, he might just have faded 
away ...” 

The big pataphvsicist wrinkled up 
his face inside his beard. Alice 
should be required reading for 
matbenauts,” he muttered re- 
flectively. “The real trouble is no 
one has ever been outside the psy- 
chic ecology when a ship is in BC- 
flight, and been back to tell about 
it. The animal experiments and the 
Norherf Wiener just never returned. 
And there were people, like Wilbur 
on the Paul R. Halmos. He just dis- 
appeared.” 

“But you work outside the field,” 
said Pearl, in a high, desperate 
voice. The psychist looked pale. 

“No,” said Goldy. “I use, well — • 
‘instruments’, powered from the 
immy.”

**Who knows wfcat couldVc hap- 
pened?” I said, growing nervous my- 
self. “You know you can map the 
volume of a sphere into the whole 
universe using the ratio: Ir: R equals 
R: Or where Ir and Or are the in- 
side and outside distances for the 
points. Maybe that’s what happened 
to Ted. Maybe he’s just outside the 
ship, filling all space with his meta- 
math and his acne?” 

“Down boy,” said Goldwasser. 
‘T’ve got a simpler suggestion. Let’s 
check over the ship, compartment 
by compartment. Maybe he’^ in it 
somewhere, unconscious.” 

ut he wasn’t on the ship. 

We went over it twice, every 
tube, every compartment. (In real- 
ity, a mathenautic ship looks like a 
radio, ripped out of its case and 
flying through the air. We ended

darkness in the middle of nothing. 
The B.C.N.Y. kids were all there — 
Freddi Urbont clucking happily 
away to her boy friend, chubby and 
smily and an education major; By- 
ron and Burbitt, electronics engi- 
neers, ecstatic over the latest copy 
of C‘Quantum; Stephen Seidmann, 
a number theory major, quiet- 
ly proving that since Harvard is the 
best school* in the world, and 
B.C.N.Y. is better than Harvard, 
that B.C.N.Y. is the best school in 
the world; two citizens with nose 
jobs and names I’d forgotten, en- 
gaged in a filthy discussion' of glands 
and organs and meat. The walls 
were firm, the straw seats scratchy 



and uncomfortable. The projecton 
shewed we were just entering the 
72nd Street stop. How real, how 
comforting! I slid the door open to 
rejoin Johnny and Ed. The subway 
riders saw me slip into freefall, and 
glimpsed the emptiness of vector 
space. 

Hell broke loose! 

The far side of the car bulged in- 
ward, the glass smashing and the 
metal groaning. The poor CUNYs 
had no compensation training! 

Freddi Urbont burst into tears. 
Byron and Burbitt sqawcked and 
yelled as the bubble in the floor 
swallowed them. The wall next to 
the nose jobs sprouted a dozen 
phallic symbols, while the seal bub- 
bled with breasts. The walls began 
to melt. Seidmann began to yell 
about the special status of N. Y. 
City University Honors Pro- 
gram students. All was in confusion, 
and my chest froze as I realized the 
psychic ecology was about to col- 
lapse. 

P earl acted with a speed and a 
surety I’d never have imagined. 
He shoved me out of the way and 
launched himself furiously at the 
other end of the car, now in free 
fall. There he pivoted, smiled hor- 
ribly and at the top of his lungs be- 
gan singing The Purple and the 
Black. 

Goldy and I had enough presence 
of mind to join him. Concentrating 
desperately on the shape and form 
of the car, we blasted the air with 
our devotion to Sheppard Hall, our 
love of Convent Avenue and our 
eternal devotion to Lewissohn Sta-

dium. Somehow it saved us. The 
room rumbled and twisted and re- 
formed, and soon the eight of us 
were back in the tired old subway 
car that bi ought its daily catch of 
Beavers to 139th Street. 

The equilibrium was still precar- 
ious. I heard Goldvvasser telling the 
nosejobs his terrible monologue 
about the “Volvo I want to buy. 1 
can be the first to break the door 
membranes, and when I get my 
hands on that big, fat steering wheel, 
ohh!, it’ll be a week before I climb 
out of it!” 

Pearl was cooing to Urbont how 
wonderful she was as the valedictor- 
ian at her Junior High, how great 
the teaching profession was, and 
how useful, and how interesting. 

As for me; “Well, I guess you’re 
right, Steve. I should have gone to 
B.C.N.Y. instead of Berkeley.” 
"That’s right, Jimmy. After all, 
B.C.N.Y. has some of the best num- 
ber theory people in the world. It’s 
great to be a number theory major 
at B.C.N.Y. It’s great to mumble 
and shout about infinite congru- 
ences and relative primes and know 
no one understands you, and 
wouldn’t be interested if they did." 
"I guess you’re right, Steve.” 
"That’s right, Jimmy. B.C.N.Y. 
has some of the greatest educators 
in the world. Like Dean Cashew, 
who started the Privileged Student 
Program. It sure is wonderful. At 
Berkeley you’re just another student, 
but at B.C.N.Y. you can look down 
and laugh at all the people not in 
fb^ Privileged Student Program.” 

“I guess you’re right, Steve.” 
"That's right, Jimmy. At B.C.N.Y. 



we have people that’ve turned dowi' 
full scholarships to Chicago anc 
M.I.T. Of course, I had to chop oft 
— I mean they’re quadruple ampu 
tees, but they love every minute 
down at the clinic.” 

— and so on. 

When the scrap paper and the 
gum wrappers were up to our knees 
and there were four false pan han 
dlers in the car, Johnny called i 
halt. The little psychist smiled anc 
nodded as he walked the three o: 
us carefully out the door. 

“Standard technique,” he mur- 
mured to no one in particular. “Do- 
ing something immediately rather 
than the best thing a while later 
Their morale was shot, so I — ” He 
trailed off. 

“Are they really that sensitive?' 
Goldwasser asked. “I thought thei 
training was better than that.” 

“You act like they were compo 
nents in an electronics rig,” sai. 
Pearl jerkily. “You know that re 
medial sensory perception, the abil 
ity to percieve the dull routine tha' 
normal people ignore, is a very deli 
cate talent. Don’t you realize wc 
mustn’t interrupt their concentra 
with orthodox things, and especially 
now with the extraordinary!” 

Pearl was well launched. “In the 
dark ages such people were called 
dullards and subnormals. Only now 
in our enlightened age, do we realize 
their true ability to know things out- 
side the ordinary senses — a talent 
vital for BC-flight.” 

The tedium and meaninglessness 
of life which we rationalize away — 
“A ship is more mind than mat- 
ter, and if you upset that mind —

Amm. I could hypnotize them. I 
could, but it fogs the. sense of reality. 
The sense of reality is very impor- 
tant to — ” 

He paled suddenly, and the corri- 
dor walls began to stutter. ‘T, I 
think Fd better stay with them,” he 
said quickly. “I know how to coach 
them, and it’s better — ” 

He flung open the door and went 
back into the coach. Goldwasser 
and I looked at each other. Pearl 
was a trained mathenaut, and he’d 
acted bravely when the CUNYs had 
panicked. But his specialty was peo- 
ple, not paramath. Well, let him 
stay where he was most effective, 
check the lab,” I muttered. 

Neither of us spoke as we moved 
toward the lab — slap a wall, pull 
yourself forward, twist round some 
instrumentation — the “reaction 
swim” of a man in free fail. The 
walls began to quiver again, and I 
could see Goldy clamp down on his 
body and memories of this part of 
the ship. We were nearing the limits 
of the BC-field. The lab itself, and 
the experimental apparatus, stuck 
out into vector space. 

“Let’s make our tests and go 
home,” I told Goldy. “This trip has 
too much of the stink of failure 
about it.” 

Neither of us mentioned Ted as 
we entered the lab. 

Ill 

R emember this was a commer- 
cial project. We weren’t pata- 
sociologists studying abstract groups, 
or super-purists looking for the first 
point. We wanted money. 



Goldy thought he had a quick 
moneymaking scheme for us, but 
Goldy hasn’t been normal since he 
took Polykarp Kusch’s “Kusch of 
Death” at Columbia, “Electrodimen- 
sions and Magnespace.” He was go- 
ing to build four-dimensional mole- 
cules. 

Go back to Flatland. Imagine a 
hollow paper pyramid on the sur- 
face of that two-dimensional world. 
To a Flatlander, it is a triangle. Flop 
down the sides — four triangles. 
Now put a molecule in each face — 
one molecule, four molecules. Neat! 
And recall that you have infinite di- 
mensions available. Think of the 
storage possibilities alone. All the 
books of the world in a viewer, all 
the food in the world in your pack. 
A television the size of a piece of 
paper; circuits looped through dim- 
19. Loop an entire industrial plant 
through hyperspace, and get one the 
size and shape of a billboard. Shove 
raw materials in one side — pull 
finished products out the other! 

But how do you make 4-dim 
molecules? Goldy thought he had a 
way, and Ted Anderson had 
checked over the math and pro- 
nounced it workable. The notion 
rested in the middle of the lab: a 
queer, half-understood machine of 
mind and matter called a Grahm- 
Schmidt generator. 

CC Teez, Ed! This lab looks like 

J your old room back in Diego 
Borough.” 

“Yeah,” said Goldwasser. “Johnny 
said it would be a good idea. Orien- 
tation against that/* 

That was the outside of the lab.

raw topological space, without ener- 
gy or matter or time. It was the 
shape and color of what you see in 
the back of your head. 

I looked away. 

Goldwasser’s room was a dupli- 
cate of his old home — the metal 
desk, the electronics rigs, the im- 
mense bookshelves, half-filled with 
with physics and half with religious 
works. I picked up a copy of Stack’s 
Time and Eternity and thumbed 
through it, then put it down, embar- 
rassed. 

“Good reading for a place like 
this.” Goldwasser smiled. 

He sat down at the desk and be- 
gan to check out his “instruments” 
from the locked drawer where he’d 
kept them. Once he reached across 
the desk and turned on a tape of 
Gene Gerard’s Excelsior! The flat 
midwestern voice murmured in the 
background. 

“First, I need some hands,” said 
Ed. “So—” 

Out in the nothingness two pairs 
of lines met at right angles. For an 
instant, all space was filled with 
them, jammed together every which 
way. Then it just setted down to 
two. 

“Oooppps,,” said Goldwasser. 
“Have to remember that they are 
just representatives of their equiva- 
lence classes. I don’t want to fill up 
all space with my fumblings. Be- 
sides, that would twist everything 
one dimension, and then we’d be 
back where we started.” 

The lab was in darkness, so in the 
dimness Goldwasser’s big form 
seemed to crouch menacing over 
the controls. He wore his engineer’s 



boots and his hair long, and a beard 
as well. He might have been some 
medieval monk, or primitive witch- 
doctor, mumbling spells and setting 
incantations. He touched a knob 
and set a widget, and checked in hit 
copy of Birkhoff and MacLane. 

“Now,” he said, and played witb 
his instruments. Two new vectctti 
rose out of the intersections. “Cross- 
products. Now I’ve a right and a 
left-handed system.” 

All the while Gene Gerard was 
mumbing in the background: 

“The Count and Igor his v*jervant 
took the beautiful maiden down to 
the crypt. ‘Ah, now, my pretty/ 
snarled the Count. ‘Come to my 
bedchamber, or I’ll leave you to 
Igor’s mercies.’ The misshapen 
dwarf cackled and rubbed his paws. 
‘Decide, decide!’ cried the count 
His voice was a scream. ‘Decide, my 
dear. SEX — ELSE, IGOR!” 
“Augh,” said Goldwasser, and shut 
it off. “Now,” he said, “I’ve got somo 
plasma in the next compartment 
I’m going to release it, and shift tho 
ions one dimension. His hands 
poised over the G. S. generator. 
“Holy Halmos,” I whispered. 

Ted Anderson stood beside tha 
generator. He looked thinner and 
paler than ever. The metamathema- 
tician’s acne stood out plainly and I 
remembered Pearl’s remark that ha 
didn’t know if he should call Ted a 
Whitehead or a Blackhead. 

T ed smiled, and went into top- 
ological convulsions. I looked 
away, and presently he came back 
in to shape. “Hard getting used ta 
real space again,” he whispered.

“I haven’t got long,” he said, as 
that was how he’d planned to start, 
“so here it is. You know I was work- 
ing on Ephraim’s theories, looking 
for a flaw. You know the popular 
explanations of mathenautics. Brill’s 
hypnotherapy and Ephraim’s math 
allow the consciousness to become 
aware of the abstract structure it 
put on the universe.” 

I winced, and he smiled painfully 
at me. “That’s for the kiddies,” he 
said, and I saw that Pearl was stand- 
ing in the iris of the tube. Johnny 
was stronger than I’d thought! 

“There isn’t any flaw,” he said. 
As he did he seemed to grow thin. 
“Ted, you’re rotating,” I cautioned. 
He steadied, and continued. 
“There’s no flaw. But the theory 
is wrong. It’s backwards. This is the 
real universe” he said, and gestured.

Beyond the lab topological space re- 
mained as always, a blank, the color 
of the back of your head through 
your own eyes. 

“Now listen to me, Goldy and 
Johnny and Kidder. What is the na- 
ture of intelligence? I guess it’s the 
power to abstract, to conceptualize. 
I don’t know what to say beyond 
that — and I doubt if 1 ever will. I 
don’t know what it is. But I know 
where it came from! Here! In the 
math spaces — they’re alive with 
thought, flashing with mind! 

“When the twiddles circuits failed 
I cracked. I fell apart, lost faith in it 
all. For I had just found what I 
though was a basic error in theory. 
I died, I vanished .

mad — but I think I passed a thres- 
hold of knowledge. I understand . 

“People think that math and sci- 
ence people are cranks — fellows 
that can only get passionate about a 
differential equation, like that Seid- 
mann fellow. But it isn’t like that at 
all. Math and science are beautiful 
and mysterious arts. The theory of 
infinity — 

“They’re out there. The things we 
thought we’d invented ourselves. 
The concepts and the notions and 
the pure structures — if you could 
see them ...” 

He looked around the room, des- 
perately. Pearl was rigid against the 
iris of the tube. Goldy looked at Ted 
for a moment, then his head darted 
from side to side. His hands whit- 
ened on the controls . 

“Jimmy,” Ted said. 

I didn’t know. I moved towards 
him, across the lab to the edge of 
topological space, and beyond the 
psychic ecology .

“But how can I say it? How 
many people can stay awake over a 
book of modern algebra, and how 
many of those can understand? 

— I saw a set bubbling and whirl- 
ing, then take purpose and structure 
to itself and become a group, gen- 
erate a second unity element, mount 
itself and become a group, generate 
a second unity element, mount itself 
and become a field, ringed by rings. 
Near it, a mature field, shot through 
with ideals, threw off a splitting field 
in a passion of growth, and became 
complex. 

— saw the life of the matrices; 



the young ones sporting, adding an4 
multiplying by a constant, the ma- 
ture ones mating by composition: 
male and female make male, femaln 
and male make female — sex 
through anticommutivity! I saw 
them grow old, meeting false iden- 
tities and loosing rows and columne 
into nullity. 

— I saw a race of vectors, losing 
their universe to a newer race ol 
tensors that conqured and hum- 
bled them. 

— I watched the tyranny of the 
Well Ordering Principle, as a fren 
set was lashed and whipped intn 
structure. I saw a partially ordered 
set, free and happy, broken before 
the Axioms of Zemelo. 

— I saw the point sets, with their 
clicks and clubs, infinite numbers of 
sycophants clustering round a Bol- 
zano — Weirstrauss aristocrat — 
the great compact medieval cover- 
ings of infinity with denumerable 
shires — the conflicts as closed sets 
created open ones, and the other 
way round. 

— I saw the rigid castes of a so- 
ciety of transformations, orthogonal 
royalty, inner product gentry, de- 
generates — where intercomposition 
set the caste of the lower on the 
product. 

— I saw the proud old cyclic 
groups, father and son and grand- 
son, generating the generations, 
rebel and blacksheep and hero, fol- 
lowing each other endlessly. Close 
by were the permutation groups, 
frolicking in a way that seemed like 
the way you sometimes repeat a sen- 
tence endlessly, stressing a different 
word each time. 



THE MATHENAUTS 



n 




There was much I saw that 1 did 
not understand, for mathematics is 
a deep, and even a mathenaut must 
choose his wedge of specialty. But 
that world of abstractions flamed 
with a beauty and meaning that 
chilled the works and worlds of 
men, so I wept in futility. 

Presently we found ourselves back 
in the lab. I sat beside Ted An- 
derson and leaned on him, and I did 
not speak for fear my voice would 
break . 

A nderson talked to Johnny and 
Ed. 

‘‘There was a — a race, here, that 
grew prideful. It knew the Riemann 
^ace, and the vector space, the al- 
gebras and the topologies, and yet 
it was unfulfilled. In some way — 
oddly like this craft, he murmured, 
gesturing — “they wove the worlds 
together, creating the real universe 
you knew in ycur youth. 

“Yet still it was unsatisfied. Some- 
how the race yearned so for new- 
ness that it surpassed itself, conceiv- 
ing matter and energy and entropy 
and creating them. 

“And there were laws and proper- 
ties for these: inertia, speed, poten- 
tial, quantumization. Perhaps life 
was an accident. It was not noticed 
for a long time, and proceeded 
apace. For the proud race had come 
to know itself, and saw that the 
new concepts were . flawed.” An- 
derson smiled faintly, and turned to 
Ed. 

“Goldy, remember when we had 
Berkowitz for algebra,” he asked. 
“Remember what he said the first 
day?” 



Goldwasser smiled. “Any math 
majors? 

“Hmm, that’s good. 

“Any physics majors? 

“Physics majors! You" guys are 
just super engineers! 

“Any chemistry majors? 

“Chemistry major! You’d be bet- 
ter off as a cook!” 

Ted finished, “And so on, down 
to the, ahem, baloney majors.” 

“He was number happy,” said Ed. 
smiling. 

“No. He was right, in a way.” Ted 
continued. “The race had found its 
new notions were crudities, simple 
copies of algebras and geometries 
past. What it thought was vigor was 
really sloth and decay. 

“It knew how to add and multiply, 
but it had forgotten what a field 
was, and what commutivity was. If 
entropy and time wreaked harm on 
matter, they did worse by this race. 
It wasn’t interested in expeditions 
though the fiber bundles; rather it 
wanted to count apples. 

“There was conflict and argu- 
ment, but it was too late to turn 
back. The race had already degen- 
erated too far to turn back. Then 
life was discovered. 

“The majority of the race took 
matter for a bride. It’s esthetic and 
creative powers ruined, it wallowed 
in passion and pain. Only remnants 
of reason remained. 

“For the rest, return to abstrac- 
tion was impossible. Time, entropy, 
had robbed them of their knowl- 
edge, their heritage. Yet they still 
hoped and expended themselves to 
leave, well, call it a ‘seed’ of softs.” 

“Mathematics?” cried Pearl. 



94 



IF 




•^It explains some things,” mused 
Goldwasser softly. “Why abstract 
mathematics, developed in the mind, 
turns out fifty years or a century 
later to accurately describe the phy- 
sical universe. Tensor calculus and 
relativity, for example. If you look 
at it this way, the math was there 
first.” 

“Yes, yes, yes. Mathematicians 
talked about their subject as an art 
form. One system is more ‘elegant’ 
than another if its logical structure 
is more austere. But Occam’s Razor, 
the law of simplest hypothesis, isn’t 
logical. 

“Many of the great mathemati- 
cians did their greatest work as 
children and youths before they were 
dissipated by the sensual world. In 
a trivial sense, scientist and mathe- 
maticians most of all are described 
as ‘unworldly’ . 

Anderson hobbled his head in the 
old familiar way. “You have almost 
returned,” he said quietly. “This ship 
is really a heuristic device, an aid to 
perception. You are on the thresh- 
hold. You have come all the way 
back.” 

The metamathematician took his 
notebook, and seemed to set all his 
will upon it. “See Ephriam gets 
this,” he murmured. “He, you, I . 
the oneness — ” 

Abruptly he disappeared. The 
notebook fell to the floor. 

I took it up. Neither Ed nor John- 
ny Pearl met my eyes. We may have 
sat and stood there for several 
hours, numbed, silent. Presently the 
two began setting up the isomorpho- 
mechanism for realization. I joined 
them.

''T^he National Mathenautics and 
A Hyperspace Administration had 
jurisdiction over civilian flights then, 
even as it Joes today. Ted was pretty 
important it seemed. Our prelimin- 
ary debriefing won us a maximum 
security session with their research 
chief. 

Perhaps, as I’d thought passion- 
ately for an instant, I’d have dona 
better to smash the immy, rupture 
the psychic ecology, let the eggshell 
be shattered at last. But that’s not 
the way of it. For all of our prog- 
ress, some rules of scientific investi- 
gation don’t change. Our first duty 
was to report back. Better heads 
than ours would decide what to do 
next. 

They did. Ephraim Cohen didn’t 
say anything after he heard us out 
and looked at Ted’s notebook. Old 
Ice Cream sat there, a big teddy- 
bear-shaped genius with thick black 
hair and a dumb smile, and grinned 
at us. It was in Institute code. 

The B.C.N.Y. kids hadn’t sees 
anything, of course. So nobody 
talked. 

Johnny Pearl married a giii 
named Judy Shatz and they had 
fifteen kids. I guess that showed 
Johnny’s views on the matter of 
matter. 

Ed Goldwasser got religion. Zeo- 
Judaism is pretty orthodox these 
days, yet somehow he found it suit- 
ed him. But he didn’t forget what 
had happened back out in space. His 
book. The Cosmic Mind, came out 
last month, and it’s a good summa- 
tion of Ted’s ideas, with a minimum

Myself. Well, a mathematician, 
especially a topologist, is useless aft- 
er thirty, the way progress is going 
along these days. But Dim-Dustries 
is a commercial enterprise, and I 
guess Tm good for twenty years 
more as a business man. 

Goldwasser’s Grahm - Schmidt 
generator worked, but that was just 
the beginning. Dimensional exten- 
sion’s made Earth a paradise, with 
housing hidden in the probabilities 
and automated industries tucked 
away in the dimensions. 

The biggest boon was something 
no one anticipated. A space of in- 
finite dimensions solves all the basic 
problems of modern computer cir- 
cuit design. Now all components can 
be linked with short electron paths, 
no matter how big and complex the 
device. 

There have been any number of 
other benefits. The space hospitals,

wounds — and topological psychia- 
try the most baffling syndromes. 
(Four years of math is required for 
pre-meds these days.) Pata-psycho- 
logy and pata-sociology finally made 
some progress, so that political and 
economic woes have declined — 
thanks too to the spaces, which have 
drained off a good deal of poor 
Earth’s over-population. There are 
even spaces resorts, or so I’m told 
— I don’t get away much. 

I ’ve struck it lucky. Fantastically 
so. 

The Private Enterprise Acts had 
just been passed, you’ll recall, and I 
had decided I didn’t want to go 
spacing again. With the training re- 
quired for the subject, I guess I was 
the only qualified man who had a 
peddler’s pack too. Jaffee, one of 
my friends down at Securities and 
Exchange, went so far as to say that 
Dim-Dustries was a hyperspherical 
trust (math is required for pre-laws 
too.) But I placated him and I got 
some of my mathemateers to realign 
the Street on a moebius strip, so he 
had to side with me. 

Me, I’ll stick to the Earth. The 
“real” planet is a garden spot now, 
and the girls are very lovely. 

Ted Anderson was recorded lost 
in topological space. He wasn’t the 
first, and he was far from the last. 
Twiddles circuits have burned out, 
Naught- Am-Revs have gone mad, 
and no doubt there have been some 
believers who have sought out the 
Great Race.

TESTAMENT 

BY JEROME BIXBY 



Spacemen don't interfere with 
primitive worlds. Of course, 
one little act can't matter — 



I t was about the size of a grape- 
fruit, and about the color of 
one. From its top sprouted a clus- 
ter of thin, ribbonish tentacles — 
translucent, filled with shifting 
shades of violet and chartreuse, far 
tougher than they looked. Four ped- 
al extremities, oddly like thumbs 
with long claws, stuck out from the 
bottom. It had two flat, pink eyes, 
set very close together. 

It squealed as Ray Caradac car- 
ried it at arm’s length into the con- 
trol room of the Manta. 

“Look what w« have here,” 1 m 
said grimly. 



Mary Caradac — small, brunette, 
snapping-eyed, the other half of Ex- 
traterrestrial Explor-ation Team 2- 
861 — looked up from the bitch- 
board, where she had been dialing 
their course away from Sirius IV. 
“What on Earth — ”she gasped. 
“On SiriuSy' Ray corrected. “O® 
good old Sirius IV, which we seeni 
not to have escaped quite as com- 
pletely as we thought we had.” 

“A baby Sirian!” 

“That’s my guess, from thi 
glimpses we got of the natives.” 
Mary stood up, spilling Benton's 
Astrocharts from her lap, and reach- 



f7 




cd for the creature. Ray relinquished 
it, looking disgusted. While Mary 
cradled it in both hands, he moved 
three steps across the narrow, in- 
strument-cluttered control room to 
snap on the rear screen. He fo- 
cused the screen with one hand, rub- 
bed his home-made crew-cut with 
the other. 

Behind him, the Sirian infant 
squealed, a sound like a viola har- 
monic. “Where’d you find it?” Mary 
asked. 

“Under my bed, of all places. I 
went to shove my suit-boots under 
it and change into sneakers, and the 
critter let out a squeal and damned 
near scared me out through the side 
of the ship.” 

“What was it doing thereT^ 

“Ask i7.” Ray stared glumly out 
at the dull green globe of Sirius 
IV, already thirty thousand miles 
away and retreating at ninety m.p.s. 
“Maybe it wanted to see the Uni- 
verse, or just get the hell off its 
planet. I can understand that, after 
two hours on the godforsaken ice 
ball.” 

“It probably likes minus thirty 
just fine. It’s probably roasting right 
now, poor thing.” 

R ay turned from the gazer. Mary 
was cuddling the Sirian infant 
to her breast and fanning it with 
one hand. 

“Look out,” he said dryly. “It 
might bite.” 

“So do human babies. Besides, 
it hasn’t got any teeth.” 

Ray looked at the tiny pink mouth, 
opening and closing horizantally un- 
der the eyes like sliding doors. He’d 



•seen enough cockeyed life-forms not 
to shudder. 

“Why, look, it couldn't have wan- 
dered in,” Mary said, twiddling one 
of the stubby legs. She set it on the 
chart file, where it immediately 
went plop on its rounded bottom, 
legs sticking out like a newborn 
kitten’s. “It can’t even stand up.” 
She flashed a hand in front of the 
pink eyes, and filmy eyelids blinked. 
The tentacles waved. “I’m no judge 
of Sirian agp, but I’ll bpt it’s darned 
young.” 

She looked wise and extended a 
finger and two tentacles curled 
around it, tugging it gently toward 
the mouth. 

“Uh, uh,” she said. “Not a nip- 
ple, son. There, Ray — ^you see?” 
She picked it up again. Another 
squeal. 

“I wasn’t arguing,” he said ab- 
sently. Then, plaintively: “Just what 
the devil are we supposed to do 
with a Sirian infant? And how did 
it get here, if it can’t walk under 
its own steam?” 

“Under someone else’s, obvious- 
ly,” Mary said practically. Then she 
paused and cocked her head. Her 
eyes widened. “Good God! I won- 
der . come on Ray, let’s go look 
where you found it. I have a per- 
fectly wonderfully preposterous 
hunch!” 

They went single-file down the 
narrow corridor that led to sleeping 
quarters, Mary carrying the infant. 
There she waited for Ray to open 
the door — as she would have done 
even if she hadn’t had her hands 
full. The Caradacs had decided long 
ago that such little niceties should be

carefully and lovingly observed 
aboard the Manta^ ten billion miles 
from nowhere. Things like love and 
sex can get awfully pedestrian in a 
sixty-foot spacer, if you don’t care 
for them right. 

Inside, Mary put the Sirian on 
Joe’s bed and said, “Hold it there.” 

Ray sat down beside the creature 
and put one hand on its back — the 
surface 180° from eyes and mouth 
— and pressed gingerly. Squeal. 

“I wonder what it eats,” he said 
sourly. 

Mary was head and shoulders un- 
der the bed. She said, “Ah, hah!” 
and emerged with a handful of dried, 
crinkly-looking leaves. They smelled 
faintly like cinnamon. The Sirian’s 
tentacles went zing! and it squealed 
an octave above any previous effort. 

“Feed it,” Mary said, going un- 
der the bed again. 

Ray put a pinch of the leaves on 
the blanket, and released the crea- 
ture, keeping one hand poised to see 
that it didn’t roll off the bed. It dug 
the claws of its front feet into the 
blanket, hiked itself toward the 
leaves, opened its mouth and crunch- 
ed away. Ray watched, eyes a little 
glazed. “What—?” 

Mary’s head appeared again. In 
one hand she held more dried 
leaves; in the other a crude basket 
about a foot square, high sided, wov- 
en of some broad, reddish fiber. 

She squatted there, holding the 
basket, and looked at Ray, 

It took Ray about six seconds to 
get it. He looked down at the crea- 
ture, happily chewing leaves, up 
again at Mary’s face. His jaw drop- 
ped. She was beginning to grin. 



Ray clapped a hand unbelievingly 
to the side of his head, so hard his 
ears rang. “God in Heaven,” he 
said. “A foundling!” 

“Basket and all,” Mary said. 
“Only the pathetic note from the 
mother is lacking.” 

44/^h, no, it’s crazy!” 

“Crazy or not, it’s here.” 
Mary touched a hand to the ten- 
tacles, and there was a squeal — a 
happy-sounding squeal. 

“But why?” Ray gasped. “Why 
should a Sirian mother — dressed is 
a threadbare Sirian shawl, no doubt 
— abandon her baby in our ship?” 
“Why do mothers in threadbare 
shawls usually abandon babies?” 
“M’m. Because they can’t sup- 
port them. Or because they’re ille- 
gitimate, or something.” 

“In this case it’s probably just 
something. I don’t think it could be 
a matter of supporting it. A B-4 
culture’s too darned primitive for 
that. They live right off the soil. 
This stuff — ”Mary pinched a hand- 
ful of leaves she’d put on the blan- 
ket — “was everywhere we walked. 
As for legitimacy, that’s never an 
issue in the pre-M series — ” 

“Tut,” said Ray, academically 
aroused. “You’re assuming, honey. 
You need ten decimals after B-4, 
or anything else to really classify. 
Forbidden fruits all over the place. 
Besides, maybe our little friend here 
isn’t a waif at all. Maybe we were 
taken for gods, and it’s a sacrifice.” 
*Tn a basket? Brought right into 
this big old terrifying ship?” 

“Oh, hell, 7 don’t know. Motive 
X, for alien. That B-4 status drove

“Not a nipple,” Mary said, dis- 
engaging her finger again. “You 
know, Ray, 1 think it’s thirsty.” 

Ray glowered at the creature. “I 
wonder what i: drinks?” 

“Try water — but be careful.” 

Ray filled a glass of water from 
the tiny basin in the corner and held 
it close to the verticle pink mouth. 
The mouth wrinkled. The little Sir- 
ian scrabbled backward and press- 
ed into the pillow. 

“So water’s out,” Ray grunted. He 
put the glass on the low table be- 
tween the beds knocking over two 
pawns and the black queen. “So 
now what? My God, didn’t whoever 
or whatever left the critter here have 
sense enough to realize that hand- 
ful of leaves wouldn’t last forever? 
That we might not have whatever 
they drink for water?” 

C4/^f course not,” Mary said pla- 
cidly. “Now who’s assuming? 
What can you expect of a B-4 . 
a cosmology? Food and water, or 
their equivalents, have always been 
around: therefore food and water 
are everywhere. A B-4 couldn’t have 
the slightest idea of what this ship 
is, or what we are, or where we’re 
from or going and how and why — ” 
“Then why was the food left?” 
“Maybe to keep our friend happy 
until we found it. Oh, I don’t know 
either! I’m just as puzzled as you are. 
But I do know what we’ve got to do 
now.” 



“What?” 

“Take it back. It’ll die if we don’t.” 

Ray sat down on the other bed 
and glared at the two who sat on 
his Mary and the Sirian infant, which 
had ceased eating and was now 
cleaning the waxy skin around its 
mouth with a tentacle. 

“Sure,” he said. “Take it back. 
Violate every damned rule in the 
book. Take a chance on Influencing, 
by letting them see us again. One 
time is bad enough — but the B 
series have short memories. * Most 
of it gets corrupted by legend, and 
after a couple of centuries the leg- 
ends are obliterated by more recent 
events and interpretations. But a 
second time? That’s the time that 
clicks.” 

“We have to, anyway. Maybe 
you’re wrong. Maybe it isn’t a 
B— ” 

“Honey, 1 studied forty years not 
to be wrong. I can look at three arti- 
facts, two flora, the dials on my 
spy-eye, and write a history.” 

Mary looked stubborn. “We take 
it back. This isn’t in the books.” 

“Maybe they’ll tear it to pieces 
if we do,” Ray argued. “Maybe it’s 
a freak — a sport. Maybe that’s why 
it landed up with us. We might be 
killing it.” 

“Well we’ll certainly be killing it 
if we don’t, so you get right on up 
to the board and get us back to that 
planet. Look how thirsty it is . 
hey, not a nipple, damn it!” 

The infant squealed, eyeing the 
finger. 

“Nobody’ll ever know, Ray. We 
can’t let the poor thing die.” 

Ray sighed and raised his brows.

Then he lowered one and winked at 
her. ‘What do I get?” 

“A lot of nothing if you don’t.” 
Mary grinned at his back. 

M y mate dead. She die having 
little one. I sorry. She best 
mate. But I sorrier for little one. 
Soon they kill him. Why kill little 
ones when mother die having them? 
Priest say because they kill mother 
and now no mother to drink from. 
So they die anyway. But they not 
kill mother. That what I think. Not 
their fault. And other mothers with 
dead little ones. No little ones to 
drink them. Why not . why not 
... do for each other? But priest 
say no. He say they bad. Must die 
because kill mother. He say he must 
drink from mothers with dead little 
ones to keep magic power. He get 
fat. This go on for long long time. 
Many thousand suns. But I wonder 
if he really have magic power or 
just want to stay fat. Soon priest 
come to take little one away and 
kill him. I sorry. Then I think of 
shiny thing that come down by 
village out of sky. Everybody afraid. 
Priest tell us to stay away. Tell us 
gods angry. Tell us to stay in huts. 
Things come out of shiny thing. Tall 
and different. They walk through 
village. Everybody afraid. I afraid 
too. But they don’t hurt. Don’t kill. 
Don’t break huts and eat like ani- 
mals. T more sorry for little one 
than afraid. I no let priest kill him. 
While tall different things walk in 
village I go out with little one. No- 
body see. Everybody afraid to look 
out. I take little one to shiny thing. 
Cave in side. I afraid but nothing 



happen. I take little one into cave 
and hide him. Leave food so he not 
cry and priest hear. I think maybe 
tall different things kill him when 
find him. But they no hurt when 
walk in village. And priest take long 
long time to kill little one if find 
him. So I hope tall different things 
treat little one good. I go back to 
village. Tall different things coming, 
I hide. They pass. I go into village. 
Everybody coming out. We see shiny 
thing go into sky. Everybody afraid. 
Priest most afraid. He say tall dif- 
ferent things bad gods. They angry. 
Must sacrifice. He want little one 
to sacrifice. I afraid. I make up 
story. I say tall different things good 
gods. I say they take little one away 
to village in sky because killing little 
ones wrong. They come to save him. 
Priest say I lie. I say he lie. I say 
good gods kill him if he kill more 
little ones when mothers die. Every- 
body listen. They say tall different 
ones didn’t hurt. Didn’t kill. Maybe 
I right. Maybe tall different ones 
really good gods. Priest say not 
true. He make up story. He say bad 
gods come because he call them to 
come take little one away and eat 
him. He say he call gods to take 
little one! But I know he lie because 
they no take. I put little one in shiny 
thing. But I don't say or they kM 
kill me for lying. I stick to stOTy. 
I tell everybody tall different ones 
good gods. Come to save little one. 
Priest say they bad gods. Come to 
take little one and eat him. Come to 
take us and eat us if we not believe 
priest. Everybody say wait for sign. 
Priest say kill me but everybody 
say wait. Lots of fathers like me.

They no like priest killing little ones 
for long time. But they afraid. Priest 
say it right. He say gods tell him 
to. We wonder. Maybe priest just 
want to be priest. Everybody afraid 
of priest. Give him best food and 
best mates. We wait. I cry that night.

didn’t leave it out in the brush as 
I’d planned. Afraid an animal would 
get it. I waited until dark and then 
went to the village. They pull in 
their sidewalks early — not a soul 
stirring. I snuck in quiet as I could, 
and right in the middle of it the 
damned critter started squealing its 
fool head off. Familiar smells or 
something, 1 suppose. So I just set 
it down and walked dignifiedly out 
of the place. Don’t know whether 
anybody saw me, but I suspect they 
did. Damn — after all the trouble we 
went to landing way out here. I 
looked back at the edge of the brush, 
and there was a crowd around the 
kid." He stepped out of the suit 
and turned to rack it by the airlock, 
wearing only the standard padded 
diaper affair. ‘‘Funny thing ... I 
thought I saw a light flashing. A 
white light. But, hell, that’s impos- 
sible — unless they have wood that 
burns white on this clod. Maybe I 
was seeing things." 

“Well, I certainly hope it’s all 
right," Mary said. “Shame if they 
did kill it, poor little thing." 

Ray stood a moment at the gazer, 
looking out at the moons-lit brush. “I 
hope so too, honey. Well — " he 
turned to the board— “let’s get out of 
here, and fast! Before Article 12, 
Section 9 fights its way right out 
of the book and jumps down our 
throats." He paused as the A. G. 
unit caught, hummed loudly, then 
softly and steadily as they rose 
from Sirius IV. “I wonder if it 
will affect them?’* 

It wasn’t until next planetfall, 
eight months later, that Ray noticed

that his pencil-flash was missing 
from his spacesuit breast-pocket. 

He asked Mary about it and 
Mary thought startledly; **Not a 
nippier and said not believing it, 
“Oh, it’ll turn up, one place or an- 
other.” 

N ext darkness we hear noise. We 
see tall different one go away. 
The good gods bring my little one 
back! Priest come out. Everybody 
say you wrong. You lie. Gods not 
eat little one! 

Priest afraid. He say they bad 
gods. Bring little one back for sacri- 
fice. They good gods. Little one 
has cold fire in hand. He throw 
cold fire at priest. This a new 
strange thing. God thing. It is a 
sign! We kill priest. Take him out 
for the animals to eat. I happy. 
Everybody like little one. He friend 
of good gods. Other mothers take 
care of him. Let him drink. Let 
other little ones drink. Do for each 
other, I happy because good gods 
bring him back 

to His people, and 
the First Night did ring with re- 
joicing; for He had returned from 
the Land Beyond the Sky and He 
said unto those who waited They 
are Good Gods, and I am Their 
Messenger, and lo! They have given 
to me a fragment of the Sun that 
I may shed light over darkness and 
open your eyes to good and gentle 
ways. And the false Priests said un- 
to Him, Prove that you speak 
Truth; and in wrath He smote the 
Priests with the great light He car- 
ried, and lo! the false Priests were 
unmasked, and fled into the wilder- 



ness where they were devoured by 
wild beasts. Then the people cried, 
Welcome, and bade Him lead tn^, 
and He said. Care for me, my Chil- 
dren, until I am able. So He was 
anointed, and fed, and in two suns 
had grown to manhood; and then 
He led His People from the valley 
and taught them to love . • 



“Always,” mused the young Galac 
Federation student. “Always they 
come to fill a need. But where dc

closed the Sirian Bible and put it 
aside, and picked up another.

He wcfs no longer human, yet he must 
battle on humanity's side against 
the deadly creature from the stars! 



I 

N at Cemp, a class C SiUde, 
awakened in his selective fash- 
ion, and perceived with the recep- 
tors that had been asleep that he 
was now quite close to the ship which 
he had first sensed approaching an 
hour before. 

Momentarily, he softened the oth- 
erwise steel-hard chitinous structure 
of his outer skin, so that the area 
became sensitive to light waves in 
the visual spectrum. These he now 
recorded through a lens arrange- 



ment that utilized a portion of the 
chitin for distance viewing. 

There was a sudden pressure in 
his body as it adjusted to the weak- 
ening of the barrier between it and 
the vacuum of space. He experi- 
enced the peculiar sensation of the 
stored oxygen in the chitin being 
used up at an excessive rate — vis- 
ion was always extremely demand- 
ing of oxygen. And then, having 
taken a series of visual measure- 
ments, he hardened the chitin again. 
Instantly, oxygen consumption re- 
turned to normal. 



104 




What he had seen with his tele- 
scopic vision system upset him. It 
was a V ship. 

Now the V^s, as Cemp knew, did 
not normally attack a full-grown 
Silkie. But there had been reports 
recently of unusual V activity. Sev- 
eral Silkies had been psychological- 
ly harassed. This group might con- 
ceivably discover where he was 
heading and use all their energy to 
prevent him. 

Even as he pondered whether to 
avoid them or to board them — as 
Silkies often did — he sensed that 
the ship was shifting its course ever 
so slightly in his direction. The de- 
cision was made for him. The Ws 
wanted contact. 

In terms of space orientation, the 
ship was neither up nor down in re- 
lation to him. But he sensed the 
ship’s own artificial gravity and 
adopted it as a frame of reference. 
By that standard its approach was 
somewhat below him. 

As Cemp watched it with upper 
range perception that registered in 
his brain like very sharp radar blips, 
the ship slowed, made a wide turn 
and presently was moving in the 
same direction as he but at a slight- 
ly slower speed. If he kept going as 
he was, he would catch up with it 
in a few minutes. 

C emp did not veer away. In the 
blackness of space ahead and 
below, the V ship grew large. He 
had measured it as being about a 
mile wide, half a mile thick and 
three miles in length. 

Having no breathing apparatus, 
obtaining his oxygen as he did en- 



tirely by electrolytic interchange, 
Cemp could not sigh. But he felt an 
equivalent resignation, a sadness at 
the bad luck that had brought him 
into contact with such a large group 
of V’s at so inopportune a time. 

As he came level with it, the ship 
lifted gently until it was only yards 
away. In the darkness on the deck 
below. Cemp saw that several doz- 
en V’s were waiting for him. Like 
himself, they wore no spacesuits, for 
they were for the time being com- 
pletely adjusted to the vacuum of 
space. In the near background. 
Camp could see a lock that led into 
the interior of the ship. The outer 
chamber was open. Through its 
transparent wall he sensed the water 
that was inside. 

A basic longing in Cemp twinged 
with anticipatory pleasure. He re- 
acted with a startled shudder, then 
thought in dismay: “Am I that close 
to the change?” 

Cemp, in the Silkie stage entire- 
ly a creature of space, settled awk- 
wardly on the deck. The special 
bone structures that had once been 
legs were sensitive to molecular ac- 
tivity within solid masses; and so it 
was through energy interchanges 
within the bone itself that he felt 
himself touch the metal. 

In a sense, then, he stood there. 
But he balanced himself with energy 
flows, and not by any muscular con- 
tractions and expansions. There 
were no muscles. And it was with 
magnetic force that he attached 
himself to the deck, and with inter- 
nal control that he moved, one after 
the other, the virtually solid blocks 
of highly differentiated bone. 



THE SILKIE 



105 




He walked forward like a two- 
legged being, feeling the stretch of 
the elasiicized bone of his legs. 
Walking was an intricate procedure 
for him. It meant softening the 
tough bone each time, then rehard- 
ening. Although he had learned long 
ago how to walk, still he was slow. 
He who could streak through space 
at 50 G’s acceleration walked on the 
deck ©f the V liner at a mile an 
hour, and was happy that he could 
show a semblance of movement in 
such an environment. 

He walked to where the V’s stood, 
pausing a few feet from the nearest 
chunky figure. 

At first look, a V seemed to be a 
slightly smaller Silkie, but Cemp 
knew that these bitter creatures 
were Variants. V for Variant. It was 
always difficult to determine which 
type of V one was looking at. The 
differences were internal and not 
readily detectable. 

And so he had his first purpose: 
to establish the identity of the V’s 
on this ship. 

H e utilized that function in his 
brain which, before it was un- 
derstood had been labeled telepa- 
thy. to communicate his message. 
There was a pause, and then a V — 
who stood well back in the group — 
replied with the same communica- 
tion method: 

“We have a reason, sir, for not 
identifying ourselves. And so we ask 
you to please bear with us until you 
understand our problems.” 

“Secrecy is illegal,” Cemp replied 
curtly. 

The answer was surprisingly free 



of the usual V hostility. ue not 
trying to be difficult,” the V sakL 
“My name is Ralden, and we want 
you to see something.” 

“What?” 

“A boy, now nine years old. He’i 
the V child of a Silkie and a breath- 
er, and he recently showed extreme 
variant qualities. We want permis- 
sion to destroy him.” 

“Oh!” said Cemp. 

He was instantly disturbed. He 
had a fleeting awareness that his 
son, from his own first mating per- 
iod, would now be nine. 

Relationship, of course, didn’t 
matter. Silkies never saw their chil- 
dren. His training required him to 
put all Silkie offspring on the same 
footing. But it was one of the night- 
mares of the uneasy peace that 
reigned among the ordinary hu- 
mans, the Special People, and the 
two surviving classes of Silkies, that 
a high-ability V would show up some 
day in the unstable world of Var- 
iants. 

The fear had proved unfounded. 
From time to time. Silkies who 
boarded the V ships learned that 
some promising boy had been exe- 
cuted by the V’s themselves. Far 
from welcoming a superior child, 
the V’s seemed to fear that if al- 
low'ed to become full-grown he 
would be a natural leader, and would 
threaten their freedom. 

The extermination of promis- 
ing boys now required the permis- 
sion of a Silkie, which explained the 
secrecy. If they didn’t obtain per- 
mission, they might still kill the 
youngster, trusting that the murder 
shin would never be identified. 



106 



IF 





THE SILKIE 



107 



“Is that the reason?” Cemp de- 
manded. 

It was. 

C emp hesitated. He sensed 
within himself all that remark- 
able complex of sensations that 
meant that he was about to change. 
This was no time for him to spend 
a day or so aboard a V ship. 

Yet if he didn’t stay, it would be 
tantamount to granting permission 
for the execution, sight unseen. And 
that, he realized, could not be per- 
mitted. 

“You have done well,” he commu- 
nicated gravely. “I shall come 
aboard.” 

The entire group of V’s moved 
along with him to the lock, huddling 
together as the great steel door 
rolted shut behind them, closing 
them away from the vacuum of 
space. The water came in silently. 
Cemp could see it exploding intogas 
as it poured into the utter emptiness 
in the lock, but presently, as the 
narrow space filled up, it began to 
hold its liquor form, and it roiled 
and rushed around everybody’s low- 
er extremities. 

The feel of it was exquisitely 
pleasurable. Cemp’s bones kept soft- 
ening automatically, and he had to 
fight to hold them hard. But when 
the water closed over the upper part 
of his body, Gemp let the living bar- 
rier that made up his outer skin 
grow soft. Because the feel of the 
water excited him, now that the 
change was so near, he had to exer- 
cise a conscious restraint. He want- 
ed to suck the warm delightful li- 
quid with visible enjoyment through 



the gills that were now being ex- 
posed. But it seemed to him that 
such a display of exuberance might 
give away his condition to the more 
experienced V’s. 

Around him, the V’s were going 
through the transformation from 
their space forms to their normal gill 
state. The inner lock opened, and 
the entire group swam through with 
a casual ease. Behind them, the in- 
ner lock door slid shut — and they 
were inside the ship itself, or rather 
in the first of the many big tanks 
that made up the interior. 

Cemp, using his vision now, 
looked around for identifying ob- 
jects. But it was the usual dim wa- 
tery world with transplanted sea life. 
Sea weeds swayed in the strong cur- 
rents that — Cemp knew — were 
kept in motion by a powerful pump- 
ing system. He could feel the surge 
of the water at each impulse from 
the pumps. As always, he began to 
brace himself for that surge, ac- 
cepting it, letting it become one of 
the rhythms of his life. 

II 

C emp had no problems in this 
environment. Water was a na- 
tural element for him, and in the 
transformation from Silkie to hu- 
man fish he had lost only a few of 
his Silkie abilities. All that Silkie 
inner world of innumerable sensa- 
tions remained. There were nerve 
centers which, both separately and 
in combination, tuned in on differ- 
ent energy flows. In early days, they 
would have been called senses. But 
instead of the five to which, for so 



^08 



IF 




many centuries, human beings had 
limited their awareness, the Silkie 
could record 184 different kinds of 
sense-impressions over a wide range 
of intensity. 

The amount was on immense 
amount of internal “noise”. Inces- 
santly stimulation poured in upon 
him. From his earliest days, control 
of what his sense receptors record- 
ed had been the principal objective 
of his training and education. 

The water flowed rhythmically 
through his gills. Cemp swam with 
the others through a watery fairy- 
land. It was a warm, tropical sea. 
As he looked ahead, he saw that the 
water universe was changing be- 
cause of their approach. The coral 
was a new, creamier color. Ten 
thousand sea worms had withdrawn 
their bright heads into their tiny 
holes. Presently, as the group 
passed, they began to come out 
again. The coral turned orange, then 
purple and orange, then other 
shades of colors and combinations. 
It was one tiny segment of the sub- 
marine landscape. 

A dozen fishes in blues and 
greens and purples darted up the 
canyon. Their wild beauty was ap- 
pealing. They were an old life form, 
Nature-evolved, untouched by the 
magic 'of scientific knowledge that 
had finally solved so many of the 
mysteries of life. Cemp reached with 
webbed fingers for a fish that dart- 
ed close to him. It whirled away in 
a flurry of momentarily whitened 
waters. Cemp grinned happily, and 
the warm water washed into his 
open mouth — ao far had he soft- 
ened. 



He was already smaller. There 
had been a natural shrinkage from 
the tense, bony Silkie body. The 
new forming muscles were contract- 
ed. The now - internalized bone 
structure was down to a length of 
seven feet from a space-maximum 
of ten. 

Of the thirtymine V’s. who had 
come out to help persuade Cemp to 
board the ship, ■ thirty-one — he 
learned by inquiry — were among 
the common variant types. The eas- 
iest state for them to be in was the 
fish condition in which they lived. 
They could be humans for brief per- 
iods, and they could be Silkies for 
periods that varied with these par- 
ticular persons from a few hours to 
a week or so. All thirty-one had 
some control of energy in limited 
amounts. 

Of the remaining eight, three 
were capable of controlling very 
considerable energy, one could put 
up barriers to energy, and four 
could be breathers for extended per- 
iods of time. 

They were all intelligent beings, 
as such things were judged. But 
Cemp, who could detect on one or 
the other of his numerous receptor 
systems subtle body odors and tem- 
peratures in water and out, and read 
meaning into the set of bone and 
muscle, sensed from each of them 
a strong emotional mixture of dis- 
content, anger, petulance and some- 
thing even more intense: hatred. As 
he nearly always did with V’s, Cemp 
swam close to the nearest. Then, 
using a particularly resistant mag- 
netic force line as a carrier — it 
held its message undistorted for a 

W 



THE SILKIB 




few feet only — he superimposed 

the question: 

“What’s your secret?” 

T he V was momentarily star- 
tled. The reflex that was tcjg- 
gered into picking up the message 
was so on the ready that it put the 
answer onto a similar force line 
which, at that instant of time, was 
passing through its head in Cemp’s 
direction. 

And Cemp had the secret. 

Cemp grinned at the effectiveness 
that he could now force a conversa- 
tion. He communicated: “No one 
threatens V’s individually or collec- 
tively. So why do you hate?” 

“I feel threatened!” was the sullen 
reply. 

“Since I know you have a wife — 
from« your secret — do you also 
have children?” 

“Yes.” 

“Work?” 

“Yes.” 

“News, drama. TV? . 

“Yes ” 

“Sport?” 

“I watch it. I don’t participate.” 
They were passing through an un- 
derwater jungle. Huge, waving 
fronds coral piled high, an octopus 
peering at them from the shadows 
of a cave^ an eel hissing and then 
darting away and fish by the dozen 
— it was still the wild part of the 
ship, where the tropical conditions 
of an earth ocean were duplicated. 
To Cemp, who had been nearly a 
month in space without a break, 
merely swimming here seemed like 
great sport indeed. 

But all he said was, “Well, friend. 



that’s all there is for anyone. A 
quiet enjoyable existence is the 
most that life has to offer. If you’re 
envying me my police duties, don’t! 
I’m inured to it, but 1 only have a 
mating period every nine and a half 
years. Would you care for that?” 

The implication in his statement, 
that Silkies could only have sex at 
intervals of nine years or so, was 
not true. But it was a myth that 
Silkies and their closest human al- 
lies, the Special People, had found 
it worthwhile to foster. Normal hu- 
man beings particularly seemed to 
find great satisfaction in what they 
conceived to be a major defect in 
the otherwise enviable Silkie. 

After Cemp completed his reas- 
suring communication, the dark 
emotion that had been radiat- 
ing from the V took on added hos- 
tility. “You’re treating me like a 
child,” he said in a grim manner. “I 
know something of the logic of lev- 
els. So don’t give me any of these 
sophistries.” 

“It’s still mostly speculation,” 
Cemp answered gently. He added, 
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell your wife 
that you’re unfaithful to her.” 

“Damn you!” said the V, and 
swam off. 

Cemp turned to another of his 
companions and had a very similar 
discussion with him. This one’s se- 
cret was that he had twice in the 
past year fallen asleep while on duty 
at one of the locks connecting the 
big ship with outer space. 

T he third person to whom 
Cemp addressed himself was a 
female. Her secret, surprisingly. 



no 



IF 




was that she thou^t herself insane. 
As soon as she realized that her 
thought had come through to him, 
the substance of her communication 
became hysterical. 

She was a graceful being, one of 
the breathers — but completely un- 
nerved now. “Don’t tell them!” she 
telepathed in terror. “They’ll kill 
me.” 

Before Cemp could more than 
consider what an unexpected ally he 
had found for himself, let alone de- 
cide what made her feel she was in- 
sane, the female communicated 
frantically: “They’re going to lure 
you into one of the shark tanks — ” 
Her almost human face contorted, 
as she realized what she had re- 
vealed. 

Cemp asked quickly, “What is 
their overall purpose?” 

“I don’t know. But it’s not what 
they said . oh, please?” She was 
threshing in the water now, physi- 
cally disorganized. In a moment it 
would look odd. 

Cemp said hastily, “Don’t worry 
— I’ll help you. You have my 
word.” 

Her name, he discovered, was 
Mensa. She said she was very beau- 
tiful in her breather form. 

Cemp had already decided that 
since she might be useful, he would 
have to let himself be drawn into 
the shark tank. 

It was not obvious when it hap- 
pened. One of the V’s who was 
capable of energy output swam up 
beside him. Simultaneously but 
casually the others fell back. 

“This way,” said his guide. 

Cemp followed. But it was several 



moments before he realized that he . 
and his guide were on one side of a 
transparent wall, and the rest of the 
group were on the other. 

He looked around for his com- 
panion. The V had dived down, and 
was sliding into a cavern between 
two rock formations. 

Abruptly the water around Cemp 
was plunged into pitch darkness. 

He grew aware that the V’s were 
hovering beyond the transpar- 
ent walls. Cemp saw movement in 
the swaying weeds: shadows, shapes, 
the glint of an eye, and the play of 
light on a grayish body . Cemp 
switched to another level of percep- 
tion, based on shadow pictures . 
and grew alert for battle. 

I n his fish stage, Cemp could 
normally fight like a super- 
electric eel — except that the dis- 
charge was a beam. No contact was 
required for what he could send 
forth. The beam had the bright flash 
of chain lightning, and was strong 
enough to kill a dozen sea monsters. 
It was formed outside his body, a 
confluence of two streams of oppo- 
sitely charged particles. 

But this was not a normal time. 
The change in him was too immin- 
ent. Any fight with a denizen of this 
sea in space would have to be with 
levels of logic, not with energy. That 
he dared not waste. 

Even as he made the decision, a 
shark swam lazily out of the jungle 
of waving fronds and as lazily, or 
so it seemed came toward him, 
turned on its side and, mouth open, 
teeth showing, slashed at him with 
its enormous jaws. 



THE SILKIE 



111 




Cemp impressed a pattm on an 
energy wave that was passing 
through his brain going toward the 
beast. It was a pattern that stimulat- 
ed an extremely primitive mechan- 
ism in the shark: the mechanism by 
which pictures were created in the 
brain. 

The shark had no defense against 
controlled over-stimulation of its 
picture making ability. In .a flash it 
visualized its teeth closing on its vic- 
tim, imagined a bloody struggle, fol- 
lowed by a feast. And then, sated, 
stomach full, it imagined itself swim- 
ming back into the shadows, into 
the underwater forest in this tiny 
segment of a huge spaceship cruis- 
ing near Jupiter. 

As the overstimulation continued, 
its pictures ceased to connect with 
body movements at all. It drifted for- 
ward and finally bumped, unnotic- 
ing, into a coral embankment. There 
it hung, dreaming that it was in mo- 
tion. It was being attacked through 
a logic related to its structure, a 
level that by-passed its own gigantic 
attack equipment. 

. Levels of logic. Long ago, 
now, men had titillated themselves 
by opening up the older parts of the 
human brain, where suggested pic- 
tures and sounds were as real as ac- 
tual ones. It was the beast level of 
logic . not human at all. For an 
animal like a shark, reality was an 
on-off phenomenon, a series of 
mechanical conditionings. Now 
stimulation. Now not. Movement al- 
ways, restless motion always — 
the endless need for more oxygen 
than was available in any one loca- 
tion 



^aught as it was in a suggested 

world of fantasy, the motion- 
less shark body grew numb from in- 
sufficient oxygen, and started to be- 
come unconscious. Before it could 
really do so, Cemp communicated 
to the watchers: “Do you want me 
to kill this game fish?” 

Silently, the beings beyond the 
transparent wall indicated where he 
could escape from the shark tank. 

Cemp gave the monster control of 
itself again. But he knew it would 
be twenty or more minutes before 
the shock would wear off. 

As he emerged from the shark 
tank a few minutes later and re- 
joined the V’s, he realized at once 
that their mood had changed. They 
were derisive of him. It was a puz- 
zling attitude on their part, for so 
far as they knew they were com- 
pletely at his mercy. 

Someone in this group must know 
why. So — 

He saw that they were now in a 
tank of very deep water — the bot- 
tom was not visible. Small schools 
of brightly colored fish skittered by 
in the green depths, and the water 
seemed slightly colder, more brac- 
ing: still delightful but no longer 
tropical. Cemp swam over to one of 
the V’s who was capable of putting 
out energy. As before, he asked: 
“What’s your secret?” 

The male V^s name was Cell, and 
his secret was that he had several 
times used his energy to kill rivals 
for the favors of certain females. He 
was instantly terrified that his mur- 
ders would be found out. But he had 
no information, except that the ad- 
ministrative officer of the ship, Ri- 



112 



IF 




bcr, had sent them to meet Cemp. 

The name was important informa- 
tion. 

But even more vital was Cemp’s 
disturbing intuition that this task of 
duty on which he was embarked was 
much more important than the evi- 
dence had so far established. He 
divined that the shark attack was a 
test. But for what? 

Ill 

A head, suddenly, Cemp could see 
the city. 

The water at this point was crys- 
tal clear. Here were none of those 
millions of impurities that rendered 
the oceans of earth so often murky. 
Through that liquid, almost as trans- 
parent as glass, the city spread be- 
fore him. 

Domed buildings. Duplicates of 
the domed undersea cities on earth, 
where real water pressure made the 
shape necessary. Here, with artifi- 
cial gravity only, water was held in 
by the metal walls and had only 
what weight the ship’s officers elect- 
ed to give it. Buildings could be any 
reasonable size, delicately molded 
and even misshaped. They could be 
beautiful for their own sake and 
need not merely have the sometimes 
sever© beauty of utility. 

The building to which Cemp was 
taken was a soaring dome with min- 
arets. He was guided to a lock, 
where only two of the breathers, 
Mensa and a male named Grig, 
stayed with him. 

The water level began to drop. 
Air hissed in. Cemp trails- , 
formed quickly to his human shape 



and stepped out of the airlock into 
the corridor of a modern, air-con- 
ditioned building. They were all 
three in the nude. The man said to 
the woman, “Take him to your 
apartment. Give him the clothes. As 
soon as I call, bring him to Apart- 
ment One upstairs.” 

Grig was walking off, when 
Cemp stopped him. “Where did you 
get that information?” he demanded. 

The V hesitated, visibly fright- 
ened at being challenged by a Silkie. 
The expression on his face changed. 
He seemed to be listening. 

Instantly, Cemp activated the 
waking centers of a portion of the 
sensory equipment that he had let 
sleep and waited for a response on 
one or more. Much as a man who 
smells a strong odor of sulphur 
wrinkles his nose, or as someone 
who touched a red-hot object jerks 
involuntarily away, he expected a 
sensation from one of the numerous 
senses that were now on the ready. 
He got nothing. 

It was true that, in his human 
state, he was not so sensitive as when 
he was in the Silkie state. But such 
a totally negative result was outside 
hii experience. 

Grig said, “He says ... as soon as 
you’re dressed . come.” 

“Who says?” 

Grig was surprised. “The boy,” he 
replied. His manner indicated: who 
ehe? 

A s he dried himself, and put 
on the clothes Mensa handed 
him, Cemp found himself wonder- 
ing why she believed herself insane. 
He asked cautiously, “Why do V’s 



THE SILKIE

have a poor opinioa of themselves?** 
“Because there's something better 
•—Silkies.” Her tone was angry, but 
there were tears of frustration in her 
eyes. She went on wearily, “I can’t 
explain it, but I’ve felt shattered 
since I was a child. Right now, I 
have an irrational hope that you will 
want to take me over and possess 
me. I wish to be your slave.” 
Half-dressed though she was, her 
jet black hair still caked and wet, 
she had told the truth about her ap- 
pearance. Her olive white skin was 
formed, her body slim and with 
graceful curve. As a breather, she 
was beautiful. 

Cemp had no alternative. Within 
the next hour, he might need what 
help she could give. He said quietly, 
“I accept you as my slave.” 

Her response was violent. In a 
single convulsion of n^ovement, she 
ran over to him, writhing out of her 
upper garments until they draped 
low on her hips. “Take me!” she 
him. “Take me as a woman!” 

Cemp, who was married to a 
young woman of the Special People, 
released himself. “Slaves don’t de- 
mand,” he said in a firm tone. “Slaves 
are used at the will of their master. 
Askd my first demand as your mas- 
ter is: open your mind to me.” 

The woman drew away from him, 
trembling. “I can’t,” she whispered, 
“The boy forbids it,” 

Cemp asked; “What in you makes 
you feel insane?” 

She shook her head. “Something 
. connected with the boy,” she 
laid. “I don’t know what.” 

“Then you’re his slave, not mine,” 
said Cemp coldly. 



Her eyes begged him. “Free met” 

the whispered. “I can’t do it myself.” 
“Where’s Apartment One?” Cemp 
said. 

She told him. “You can take the 
stairway or the elevator,” she said. 

Cemp went by the stairway. He 
needed a few minutes, just a few, 
to determine his course of action. 
He decided — 

See the boy! Determine his fate. 
Talk to Riber, the administrative of- 
ficer of the ship. Punish Riber! Or- 
der this ship to a check-in point! 

These decisions were hardened in 
his mind as he reached the upper- 
level and pressed the button beside 
the door of apartment one. 

The door swung open noiselessly. 
Cemp walked in — and there was 
the boy. 

H e was slightly under five feet 
tall, as fine looking a human 
child as Cemp had ever seen. The 
youngster was watching a TV screen 
set into one wall of the big room. 
When Cemp entered, the boy turned 
lazily and said, “I was interested to 
see what you would do with that 
shark, in view of your condition.” 
He knew! 

The realization hit Cemp hard. 
He braced himself and agreed with- 
in himself to die; make no bargains 
to avoid exposure; come to his final 
decision with even greater care. 

The boy said, “You couldn’t pos- 
sibly do anything else.” 

Cemp was recovering, but cur- 
ious. He had set up a complete no- 
signal condition within himself. Yet 
the boy was reading detailed signals. 
How was it done?” 



114 



IF 




Smiling faintly, the boy shook his 
bead. 

Cemp said, “If you dare not tell, 
dien it isn’t much of a method. I 
deduce that if I find it out, I can 
defeat it.” 

The boy laughed, made a dismiss- 
al gesture, changed the subject. “Do 
you believe I should be killed?” 

Cemp looked into those bright, 
gray eyes that regarded him with a 
boyish mischievousness, and felt a 
qualm. He was being played with by 
someone who regarded himself as 
untouchable. Question was, was the 
boy fooling himself, or was it real? 

“It’s real,” said the youngster. 

And if it was real — Cemp’s 
analysis continued — were there 
built in restraining factors such as 
kept Silkies under control? 

The boy said curtly, “That I will 
not answer.” 

“Very well.” Cemp turned away. 
“If you persist in that decision, then 
my judgment is that you are outside 
the law. No person who cannot be 
controlled will ever be permitted to 
live in the solar system. But I’m go- 
ing to give you a little while to 
change your mind. My advice: de- 
cide to be a law-abiding citizen.” 

He turned, and left the apartment. 
And at least ,one important reality 
was that he was allowed to do so. 

IV 

G rig was waiting on the hall- 
way outside. He seemed eager 
to please. Cemp, who wanted to 
meet Riber, asked if Riber was a 
breather. Riber was not; so Cenqp 
and Grig took to the water. 



Cemp was guided to an enormous 
depth, to where several domes wer# 
fixed to the inner hull of the ship. 
There, in a water-filled labyrinth of 
metal and plastic, he found Riber. 
The administrative leader of the 
ship turned out to be a long, strong 
fish being, with the peculiar, pro- 
truding eyes of the fish state. He Vvas 
floating beside a message receiving 
machine. In one hand he held the 
transmitter for the machine. He 
looked at Cemp and turned the 
machine on. 

He said aloud in the underwater 
language: “I think our conversation 
should be recorded. I don’t think I 
can trust a Silkie to make a fair re- 
port on this special situation.” 

Cemp acquiesced without an ar- 
gument. The interchange began with 
Riber making what seemed to be a 
completely frank statement. He 
said, “This ship and all aboard are 
controlled by that remarkable boy. 
He is not always here, and so for 
the most part we do as we always 
have. But those people who went out 
to meet you had no way of resisting 
his commands. If you can deal with 
him, then obviously we shall be free 
again. But if you can’t, then we are 
his servants like it or not.” 

Cemp said, “There has to be some 
vulnerable level. Why, for example, 
do you do as he wants?” 

Riber said, “I laughed when he 
first told me what he wanted. But 
when I came to, hours later, I re- 
alized that I had done everything he 
desired while I was unconscious. Ae 
a result, I now do it consciously. 
This has been going on for about a 
year, earth time.” 



THE SILKIE 



Ilf 





Cemp questioned Riber closely. 
That he had continued physical 
functioning when he was under the 
boy’s control indicated that a shut- 
off of normal outside perception was 
the principal method of inducing 
unconsciousness. 

Considering that, Cemp remem- 
bered the V whose secret was that 
he had fallen asleep while tending 
one of the outer locks. At Cemp’s 
request, lock attendants were as- 
sembled. He interviewed each one 
privately with the question: ‘‘What’s 
your secret?” 

Seven of the twenty revealed, in 
this unwitting fashion, that they had 
slept while on duty. It turned out to 
be that simple. The boy had arrived 
at the lock entrance, blanked out 
the mind of the attendant, and en- 
tered the ship. 



It seemed to Cemp he need ex- 
amine no further. 

There was a frame, logic. The 
problem, which for a time had 
seemed to involve some new and in- 
tricate kind of telekinetic control, 
was beginning to look much more 
mundane. 

He returned to the woman’s 
apartment and put on clothes again. 
Mensa went with him to the door. 
She whispered, “Don’t you dare 
leave this ship without making love 
to me. I need to feel that I belong 
to you.” 

Basically, that was not so, Cemp 
knew. She lived by reversals. She 
would always want what she did not 
have, despise or reject what she had. 
But he reassured her that he meant 
well by her — and went up again to 
Apartment One. 



116 



IP 




I t seemed to Cemp as he 
walked in that the boy’s face 
was flushed and that the eyes that 
had been so bright were duller. 
Cemp said softly, “If I can figure it 
out, so can any Silkie. You went to 
a lot of trouble. Which tells me you 
do have limitations.” 

Silkies could approach a vessel, 
undetected, if they were prepared 
to manipulate energy waves. But the 
method wa^ involved, requiring 
training. 

Cemp said, “Well, you know my 
thoughts. Which one is correct?” 
Silence. 

“Your problem,” said Cemp em- 
phatically, “is that the Special People 
take no chances with dangerous de- 
viates.” 

He hoped the boy understood 
how ultimately determined the Spe- 



cial People were. 

Abruptly, the boy sighed. “I 
might as well admit it. I am Tern, 
your son. When I realized it was you 
approaching the ship, I thought I’d 
have a look at my father. The truth 
is I became frightened that those 
abilities which you found so unusual 
would be detected. So I’ve been out 
here in space setting up an operat- 
ing base to which I could retreat for 
my own protection. But I realize I 
need help. I think some changes 
should be made in our relationship 
with human beings. Other than that, 
I’m willing to conform and be re- 
educated.” 

For Cemp, it was the decisive 
clarification. Then and there he 
made up his mind. There would be 
no execution. 

Hastily — for Cemp was a man 



THE SiLKIE 



117 




in a hurry — they discussed the sit- 
uation. Cemp would have to tell of 
this meeting when he got back to 
Earth. There was no way by which 
a Silkie could conceal the facts from 
the perceptive Special People. And 
foi many months, while he was in 
his mating stage, he would have no 
control of energy. During that per- 
iod the boy would be at the mercy 
of a highly prejudiced law. 

Tern was disdainful. “Don’t wor- 
ry about me. I’m ready for them.” 
It was rebel talk, dangerous and 
unfortunate. But this was not the 
moment to point that out. Such 
matters could be left until they got 
home. 

“You’d better start now,” said the 
boy, “but as you’ll see I’ll get to 
Earth before you do.” 

Cemp did not pause to find out 
how he would achieve such a mir- 
acle of speed. That also would have 
to wait. 

A s Cemp removed his clothes 
in Mensa’s apartment, he said 
to her with considerable pride, “The 
boy is my son.” 

Her eyes widened. “Your son!” 
she said. “But — ” She stopped. 
“What’s the matter?” Cemp asked. 
“Nothing.” She spoke mechanical- 
ly. “I was surprised, that’s all.” 
Cemp finished dressing, then 
went over to her, and kissed her 
lightly on the forehead. He said, “I 
sense that you are involved in a love 
relationship.” 

She shook her head. “Not now. 
Not since — ” She paused. She 
seemed bewildered. 

It was no time to check on a 



woman*s love life. If ever a maa was 
in a hurry it was he. 

When Cemp had gone, the boy 
came in. “You almost gave m ' 
away,” he said in a tone that was 
wholly unchildlike. 

She cringed. “Tm only a V,” she 
pleaded. 

He began to change, to grow. 
Presently, a fully adult human male 
stood before her. He directed to- 
ward her energy wave that must 
have exerted an enormous attrac- 
tion to her, for in spite of the deep- 
ening expression of distaste on her 
face she swayed toward him. When 
she was within a foot of him, he cut 
off the wave. She drew back imme- 
diately. The man laughed. 

But he turned away from her, and 
for a few moments then he opened 
a communication line to someone 
on the planet of a distant star. He 
said in a silent interchange: 

“I have finally risked confronta- 
tion with a Silkie, one of the power- 
ful inhabitants of this system. He is 
guided by an idea called Levels of 
Logic. I discovered that his had to 
do with his only offspring, a boy he 
has never seen. I distorted his in- 
terest in this child in a subtle way. 
I think I can now land safely on the 
principal planet, which is called 
Earth.” 

“To distort it, you must have had 
to use him as a channel.” 

“Yes. It was the one risk I took 
with him.” 

“What about the other channels 
you have used, Di-isarill?” 

The man glanced at Mensa. “With 
one possible exception, they would 
resist any attempt of a Silkie to ex- 



118 



IF 




plore their minds. They’re a rebel 
group called V’s, and are suspicious 
of and hostile to the other peoples 
in this system. The exception is a 
V woman who is completely under 
my control.” 

“Why not annihilate her?” 

“These people have some kind of 
a sensitive telepathic connection, 
which they seem to be able to ma- 
nipulate but which I have not whol- 
ly solved. If she died I think the 
others would know instantly. There- 
fore I cannot do what I normally 
would.” 

“What about the Silkie?” 

“He is heading to Earth in a state 
of delusion. Equally important, he 
is due to suffer a physiological 
change which will strip him of all 
hrs present offensive and defensive 
powers. I intend to let this physical 
process run its course — and then 
kill him.” 

V 

C emp had relayed the story 
through Satellite-Five-R to his 
contact, Charley Baxter, at the 
Silkie Authority. When he reached 
the satellite, and transformed to hu- 
man, he found a radiogram from 
Charley waiting* for him. It said: 

HAVE PICKED UP BOY. AU- 
THORITY FORBIDS YOU TO 
LAND UNTIL THIS IS ALL SET- 
TLED. 

“Till you’ve done away with him, 
you mean!” Cemp thought angrily, 
the official action surprised hini: 
an unexpected obstacle. 



The commander of the satellite, a 
normal intelligent human being, 
who had handed him the message, 
said, “Mr. Cemp, I have received in- 
structions not to let you on any ferry 
to Earth until further notice. Thii 
is very unusual.” 

“Unusual” was an understatement. 
Silkies ordinarily moved freely to 
and from Earth. 

Cemp made up his minS. “I’m 
going out into space again,” he said 
in a matter-of-fact tone. 

“Aren’t you due for the change?” 
The officer seemed doubtful about 
letting him go. 

Cemp smiled wryly and told the 
Silkie joke about such things, about 
how Silkies were like some mothers- 
to-be who kept having false labor 
pains. Off to the hospital they went. 
Lay there in bed. At last returned 
home. And so, after several false 
alarms, baby finally was born in a 
taxicab. 

“Well, sir,” said the man unhappi- 
ly. “You do as you please. But there 
aren’t any taxicabs in space.” 

“It’s not that instantaneous; you 
can fight it off for hours,” said 
Cemp, who had been fighting it off 
for hours. 

Before he left, Cemp sent a radio- 
gram to his wife: 

DEAR JOANNE: DELAYED 

BY DISPUTE. WILL ADVISE 
WHEN TO MEET, BUT SOON. 
CALL CHARLEY. HE’LL FILL 
YOU IN. ALL MY LOVE. NAT. 

The coded message would upset 
her, he knew. But he did not doubt 
that she would met him at their 
pre-arranged rendevous, as he 
wanted. She would come if only to 



THE SILKIE 



Ilf 




find out on behalf of the Special 
People what he was 'jp to 

Once out in space. Cemp headed 
for a point over the Snmh Pok. and 
then he began his entry 

He came in fast A:.:ording to 
theory, that was the only way an un- 
protected approach should he made. 
The pole<^ were relativclv free of 
radiation There where the mag- 
netic field of the planetary hodv was 
bent inward right down to the 
ground, the potent Van Allen radia- 
tion belt was a minimum threat 
Nonetheless, there were two per- 
iods of severe bombardment, one of 
high energy stripped nuclei, the oth- 
er Jt X-rays. The X-rays did him 
nc narm, and, for the most part, the 
stripped nuclei passed right through 
his body as if it were a hard vac- 
uum. Those nuclei that hit, how- 
ever left a small wake of radioac- 
tivity. Hastily, Cemp expelled the 
more seriously damaged cells, with 
that special ability Silkies had of 
eliminating damaged parts of their 
bodies. 

As he entered the atmosphere, 
Cemp gradually activated the plan- 
et’s magnetic force lines behind him. 
Even as they began to glow brightly, 
he felt the radar beams from below 
bouncing from him. But they were 
not a problem now. Radar would 
register the movement of his body 
and the pyrotechnic display to his 
rear as one • phenomenon. The out- 
ward appearance was of a meteorite 
shooting toward the ground. 

H is entrance being slantwise in 
the direction of Earth’s rota- 
tion, his speed of entry was within 



his capacity to absorb, or radiate 
from him, the heat of his passage 
through the air. At ten miles up, he 
slowed even more and came down in 
the sea north of Antarctica about a 
thousand miles from the lower tip 
of South America. The cold waters 
quickly washed from his Silkie body 
the radioactive debris that still clung 
to the outer bone. He darted along 
about five hundred feet up, using 
the water as a coolant by slowing 
and diving into it whenever he got 
too hot. It was a fine balancing of 
extremely rapid acceleration and de- 
celeration. But he made it to near 
where he lived at the lower tip of 
Florida in slightly more than forty 
minutes, the last five of which were 
wholly underwater. 

As he surfaced within sight of 
the beach, he transformed to his fish 
stage, and then — two hundred feet 
from shore — to human He had al- 
ready seen Joanne’s car parked on 
the road behind a sand dune. He did 
the overhand crawl to get to shal- 
low water, and ran against the surg- 
ing waves up the embankment to 
where she lay on a blanket, watch- 
ing him. 

She stood up, a slender, very 
pretty woman, blonde and blue- 
eyed. Her classically even features 
were white and set now; but she 
handed him a towel. Cemp dried 
himself, and climbed into the clothes 
she had brought. A few minutes 
later they were in the car; and at 
this i^)oint she accepted his kiss. But 
she still withheld her thoughts, and 
her body was rigid with disapproval. 

When she finally communicated, 
it was verbally and not by direct eo- 



120 



IF 




crgy. She said, ^Do you realize that 

if you persist in this you will be the 
first Silkie in a hundred years to get 
himself punished or executed?” 

That she spoke out loud con- 
firmed Cemp’s suspicion. He was 
now certain that she had reported 
his illegal entry to the Silkie Author- 
ity, and that people were listening 
in to this conversation. He felt no 
blame of Joanne. He even surmised 
that all the Special People were pre- 
pared to help him through this try- 
ing period. They were probably also 
speeding up the investigation of 

Tern, so that the execution would 

be quickly over with. 

“What are you going to do, Nat?” 
She sounded anxious now, rather 

than angry. There was color m her 
face for the first time. 

At some depth within, Cemp felt 
vaguely surprised at how deter- 

mined he was. But the awareness did 
not trigger any question in him. He 
said coolly: “If they kill that boy, Fll 
know the reason why.” 

She said softly, “I never realized 
that a Silkie could have so much 
feeling for his child, whom he has 
not seen since birth.” 

Cemp was irritated. “It’s not per- 
sonal,” he said curtly. 

She said with sudden emotion: 
“Then you know the reason very 
well. This boy evidently has a meth- 
od of concealing his thoughts, and 
of reading minds — according to 
your own account — that even you 
could not penetrate. With such a 
person, the Special People will not 
have their historic protection. It be- 
comes a matter of policy.” 

“In making my report,” said 



Cemp, “I advised a five year studv 
and re-education program for th : 
boy. That’s the way it’s going to be. ' 

S he seemed not to hear. She sai i 
as if thinking out loud: “Silk 
ies were mutated by humans, on th: 
basis of the great biological disco\- 
eries of the last half of the twent - 
eth century. When the basic lil : 
chemical unit, DNP, was isolated, 
major advances in life forms, othe:- 
than those naturally spawned in Na 
ture, became possible. Because th 
first transformations were to the fis’ 
stage, the new beings were callev' 
Silkies — after an old song. 

“But it had to be done carefully 
The Silkie could not be permitted ti 
breed as he pleased. So his genes, 
which endow him with so many 
marvellous senses and abilities, alsc 
contain certain limitations. He car. 
be a man, a fish, a Silkie at will 
So long as he does it by body con 
trol, he has nearly all his Silkie abil 
ities in any of these forms. But ev- 
ery nine and a half years he has t( 
become a human being again, in or 
der to mate. It’s built into him. 
where he can’t interfere with ii. 
Silkies who long ago tried to elim 
inate this phase of the cycle were 
executed. At the time of such r. 
compulsive change to human form, 
he loses all his Silkie abilities, ane 
becomes fallibly human. That’s th: 
great hold we have over him. Thei'. 
we can punish him for anything il 
legal he did as a Silkie. Another 
hold is that there are no female 
Silkies. If the issue of a Silkie mat- 
ing with a woman of the Special 
People is a girl, she is not a Silkie 



THE SILKIE 



121 




That, too, is built into his genes — ” 
She broke off: “The Special Peo- 
ple are a tiny, tiny portion of the 
main human stream who — it was 
discovered — had a spontaneous 
ability to read the minds of Silkies. 
They used this to establish adminis- 
trative ascendancy while there were 
still only a few Silkies, and thus they 
protected themselves and the human 
race from beings who would other- 
wise have overwhelmed them.” 

She finished in a puzzled tone: 
“You’ve always agreed that such 
protection was necessary, for hu- 
man beings to survive. Have you 
changed your mind?” When Cemp 
did not reply, she urged: “Why don’t 
you go to the Silkie Authority and 
talk to Charley Baxter? A single 
conversation with him will get you 
further than any rebelli«n.” She add- 
ed quickly. “Tern is there. So you’ll 
have to go there anyway. Please, 
Nat.” 

It wasn’t so much, then, that 
Cemp agreed with what she said. 
He thought of her suggestion very 
distinctly as offering a way of get- 
ting inside the building — But he 
was not too surprised as his helijet 
came down on the roof to see Char- 
ley Baxter waiting for him, tall, ra- 
ther goodlooking, thin, unusually 
pale. 

A s they rode down in an ele- 
vator, Cemp felt himself pass 
through in energy screen — which 
instantly sealed off the pulsations 
from the outside world. And that 
was normal enough except for the 
force that was driving the screen. 
He sensed that the power backing it 



was enormous enough to protect a 
city, or even a part of the planet 
Cemp glanced questioningly at 
Baxter, and met a pair of sober, ser- 
ious eyes. The man said seriously, 
“At this point, you may read me.” 
What he read in Baxter’s mind 
was that his own radiogram about 
Tern had caused a hasty examina- 
tion of Tern’s record. Result: they 
decided the boy was normal, and 
that something very serious had 
happened to Cemp. 

“At no time,” said Baxter, “has 
your son been in danger. Now, take 
a look at that TV picture. Which 
one is Tern? One is.” 

They had walked from the eleva- 
tor into a large room. On the TV 
screen on one wall was a street 
scene. Several boys were approach- 
ing what must have been a hidden 
camera, for they showed no aware- 
ness of its presence. 

Cemp’s gaze flicked across the 
strange faces. “Never saw them be- 
fore,” he said. 

“The boy to your right is your 
son,” said Baxter. 

Cemp looked, then turned and 
stared at Baxter. And because his 
brain had energy relationships that 
by-passed mere neuron connections, 
he got the whole picture in a single- 
flash of understanding. That instan- 
taneous comprehension included an- 
alytical awareness of how his duty to 
protect all Silkie children had been 
skillfully twisted by his pseudo son. 
It leaped on to a lightning examin- 
ation of the energy level that had 
signaled to him. Almost immediately, 
he realized that the signal was the 
only direct contact that had been 



122 



IF 




made by the boy on the V ship. In 
every other way, the fraudulent Tern 
had merely been a recipient of sig- 
nals. 

He grew conscious of Baxter’s 
bright eyes watching him. The man 
asked breathlessly: “Think we can do 
anything?” 

It was too soon to answer that. 
Cemp was gratefully realizing how 
skillfully he had been protected by 
the Special People. It seemed to him 
that if he had suspected the truth 
at any moment before being taken 
behind the energy screen that now 
guarded him — the false Tern would 
probably have tried to annihilate 
him. 

Baxter was speaking again. “You 
sit down here, and let’s see what the 
computer makes of the one signal 
you received.” 

The computer extrapolated three 
structural frames that might fit the 
false Tern. Cemp and Baxter stud- 
ied the coded messages with amaze- 
ment, for they had not actually con- 
sidered anything beyond an unusual 
V frame. 

All three formulated structures 
were alien. 

A quick analysis established that 
two of the three did not require se- 
crecy on the part of so powerful a 
being as the invader undoubtedly 
was. Therefore the third frame, in- 
volving a gruesome form of esoteric 
sex climaxed by the ritual murder 
of one partner by the other, spider- 
like, was the most likely. 

Baxter’s voice had in it a desire 
not to believe. “That picture of their 
needing a lot of love objects — 
could that be real?” He finished in 




THE SILKIE 



m 



a subdued tone: “I’ll alert all Silkies, 

mobilize our other forces — but can 
you do anything at once?” 

Cemp who had already adjusted 
his sensory system to include all 
three alien frame was tense and 
afraid. He said aloud, “1 ask myself 
where he would go and of course it 
would be to my home. Do you think 
Joanne would have gotten there 
yet? Was she supposed to head some- 
where else?” 

He saw that Baxter was shaking 
his head . 

Cemp hurried through a door that 
led to a wide balcony, transformed 
to Silkie, did a partial cut-off of 
gravity combined with control of 
magnetic force lines ... a man in 
a far greater hurry than he had ever 
been in before. 

H e entered the large house by the 
sea in his human form, the bet- 
ter to run the last few yards and 
maneuver in corridors. And because 
he had adjusted to the alien sensory 
structure his arrival was only part- 
ly signaled. 

He found Joanne in the master 
bedroom, half-undressed. 

She had never seemed so attrac- 
tive. Her smile, warm, inviting, 
friendly, drew him. Some state of 
excitement she was in communicat- 
ed to him, stirring an impulse so 
basic that it was as if a fine trans- 
lucent sheath ‘ dropped over his 
senses, blurring his view of reality. 
The woman, almost luminescent in 
a fleshly radiance, lay on the pink 
bed and his whole being focused on 
her. For a long moment, nothing 
else existed. They were two people 



intensely in love. 

Breathless, astounded by that in- 
stant, hideous power, Cemp put his 
thought on the possible fate of the 
real Joanne, put his attention on 
fear for her — and broke the spell. 

The rage, hate and violence that 
had been building up in him broke 
through. 

But the magnetically controlled 
radiation that Cemp launched at the 
creature crackled harmlessly against 
a magnetically controlled energy 
screen . Frothing, he plunged at 
the being, grabbed at him with his 
bare hands. 

For seconds they grappled, the 
almost nude woman and the wholly 
naked Cemp. Then Cemp was flung 
back by muscles that were ten times 
as strong as his own. 

He bounded to his feet, but he 
was sobered, thinking again. 

He began to consider the entire 
problem of Earth in relation to this 
creature and the threat it represen- 
ted. 

The duplicate of Joanne was 
changing. The body in front of 
Cemp became that of a man with 
the frilly clothes of a woman’s un- 
derdress still draped on the lower 
part of his body. But there was 
nothing feminine in his manner. Eyes 
blazing with the infinite violence 
potential of the male, the entity 
locked gazes with Cemp. 

Cemp was feeling a desperate 
anxiety for the real Joanne. But it 
did not even occur to him to ask 
this creature about her. He said, in- 
stead, ‘T want you to leave. We’ll 
communicate when you’re a million 
miles out in space.**

IF 




The handsome human face of the 
other broke into a disdainful smile. 

go. But I sense in you a plan 
to learn from me where I come 
from. That will never happen.” 
Cemp replied in a level tone: 
“We’ll see what two thousand Silk- 
ies can get out of you.” 

The being’s skin glistened with 
health, shone with confidence and 
power. He said: “Perhaps I should 
remind you that we Kibmadine 
have achieved a total control of all 
the forces that Silkies control only 
partially.” 

Cemp said, “Many rigidities can 
envelop one flexibility.” 

The other said in an uncompro- 
mising voice, “Don’t attack me. The 
price is too high.” 

He started to turn away. And 
there was a moment, then, when 
Cemp had another thought, anorher 
feeling: a reluctance to let this being 
go without some attempt to reach 
across the abyss that separated 
them. Because this was man’s first 
contact with an alien intelligence. 
For a few fleeting seconds Cemp re- 
membered the thousand dreams 
that human beings had had for such 
a meeting. His hesitation came to its 
inevitable end. The infinitely hostile 
reality moved in to fill the endless 
void between' them. 

Instants later the alien was out on 
the patio, dissolving, changing — and 
was gone. 

C emp contacted Baxter and 
said, “Line me up with another 
Silkie so that he can take over. I’m 
really awfully close to my change.” 
He was lined up through the 
Silkie communications hub with a 



SKlkie named Jedd. Meanwhile, Bax- 
ter said, “I’m on my way over. I 
have been given a lot of governmen- 
tal power.” 

Cemp found Joanne in one of the 
spare bedrooms. She lay on the bed, 
fully dressed, breathing slowly and 
deeply. He sent a quick flow of en- 
ergy through her brain. The reflexes 
that were stirred reassured him that 
she was merely sleeping*. He also 
picked up some of the alien energy 
that was still in her cells. They told 
a story that made it instantly ob- 
vious why she was still alive: The 
Kibmadine had used her living body 
as a model for his duplication of 
her. 

On this occasion at least the crea- 
ture had been after bigger game: a 
Silkie. 

Cemp did not try to rouse the 
sleeping woman. But he was great- 
ly relieved as he went out onto the 
patio, which overlooked a white, 
sandy beach and the timeless blue 
ocean beyond. He sat there until 
Baxter presently joined him. 

They had already communicated 
mentally, and now Baxter said, “I 
sense a doubt in you.” 

Cemp nodded. 

Baxter asked gently, “What do 
you fear?” 

^^DeathV^ 

It was a feeling deep inside him. 

Sitting there, he made up his 
mind — for the second time since 
he had become involved with the 
alien — to die if necessary. And 
with that decision, he began to turn 
on his receptors, all of them except 
that to start, he tuned out local 
Earth noise. TV, radio, innumerable 
energies from machines — these 



THE SILKIE 



125 




had to be shut away from him. 
Swiftly, then, he began to ‘‘hear” the 
signals from the plenum. 

Long before Silkies it had been 
known that space was alive with 
messages; the entire sidereal uni- 
verse pulsed with an incredible num- 
ber of vibrations. Hour on hour and 
year by year, Silkies, lived with that 
ceaseless “noise”, and most of their 
early training was entirely and ex- 
clusively directed to the development 
of selective sleep and rest and wake- 
fulness mechanisms for each recep- 
tor. 

Now — those that were asleep 
awakerred. Those that were at rest 
alerted. 

His brain came to peak aware- 
ness. 

He began to sense the near stars, 
the distant stars the clusters the 
galaxies. Every star had its only 
complex signal. Nowhere was there 
a duplication or even a close sim 
ilarity. 

The universe that he tuned in up- 
on was composed entirely of indi- 
viduals. Cemp appraised the dis- 
tance of each star, the uniqueness of 
each signal. Friendly space world! 
Every star being exactly and pre- 
cisely what it was and where it was 
gave meaning to the immense stel- 
lar universe. There was no chaos. 
He experienced his own location in 
space and time,- and it gave him a 
certainty of the basic rightness of 
things. 

VII 

H e came back from his far- 
flung ranging to about a mil- 
lion mdes from Earth. There he 



paused to let the signals come in 
from all of the space between 

Without opening his eyes, he said 
to Baxter, “I don’t read him. He 
must have gone around the planet 
and put the mass of Earth between 
him and me. Are the reflectors 
ready?” 

Baxter talked on a phone line 
that had been kept open for him. 
Previously alerted Telstar and astro- 
nomical satellites were placed at 
Cemp’s disposition. Through one of 
the reflectors, he focused on the in- 
vading entity. 

Cemp said to the alien, “Above 
everything else we want informa- 
tion.” 

The other said, “Perhaps I should 
tell you our history.” 

And so Cemp was given the story 
of the eternal lovers, more than a 
million beings who moved from one 
planetary system to another, and 
each time altered themselves to the 
form of the inhabitants and estab- 
lished a love relationship with them 
— a love relationship that meant 
death and pain for their love- 
objects. Only twice had the lovers 
met beings of sufficient power to 
make them draw back. In each in- 
stance, they had destroyed the en- 
tire system. 

Di-isarill finished: “No additional 
information is available no matter 
what you do.” 

Cemp broke contact. A shaken 
Baxter said, “Do you think that was 
true information?” 

Cemp answered that the thought 
it was. 

He finished with finality: “Our job 
is to find out one thing: Where does 



126 



IF 




ke come from? And then destroy 

him” 

*^But how do you propose to do 
this?” 

I t was a good question. His 
single clash with the creature 
had brought him up hard against a 
wall of power. 

Cemp sank lower into his settee 
and with closed eyes considered the 
problem of a race of beings who 
had complete control of body 
change. Many times in those long 
duty watches out in space, he had 
pondered such possibilities; for the 
cell could grow and ungrow, divide, 
split off, fall away and re-form, all 
within a few seconds. In the twilight 
varus, the bacteria and the cell had 
their complex being, the enormous 
speed of change had made possible 
the almost instantaneous orderly al- 
tering of human to Silkie and back 
again. 

The invader apparently could 
change to an infinite number of 
forms with equal rapidity, assuming 
any body shape at will. 

But the logic of levels applied to 
the Kibmadine’s every action. 

From somewhere behind Cemp, 
Baxter said, “Are you sure?” His 
voice sounded incredulous. 

Cemp had two reactions to the 
question: Extreme joy at the hope 
that his analysis brought. and the 
stronger conviction. He said aloud, 
“Yes, logic applies. But for him 
we’ll need the closest contact of the 
energies involved. Inches would be 
better than feet, feet better than 
yards. So FU have to get out there 
in person.” 



“Out where?” Baxter asked, al- 
most incredulous. 

“To his ship.” 

“Do you think he has a ship?” 

“Of course he has one. Anything 
else would be impractical for his 
operations. 

Cemp was patient as he made his 
explanation. He had observed that 
even the Special People had exag- 
gerated ideas on such matters. They 
tended to accept that Silkies were 
more capable than they were. But 
the logic of it was simple: coming 
in toward a sun, one could utilize 
its full gravitational pull to get up 
speed. Right now the Kibmadine 
would be “climbing the ladder” of 
the planets, cutting off the sun’s 
gravity from behind, opening up to 
the pull of Jupiter and the outer 
planets. 

No sensible being would try to 
bridge the distances between stars by 
such a method. So there was a ship. 
There had to be. 

Cemp said, “Order a spaceship for 
me, complete with a tank of water 
that can be moved.” 

“You expect to change before you 
get there?” 

“It’ll happen any minute.” 

Baxter said, amazed, “You intend 
to confront the most powerful being 
that we can imagine without a single 
bit of energy of your own avail- 
able?” 

“Yes,” said Cemp. “It’s the only 
way we’ll get him within inches of 
the energy source I want installed 
in the tank. For heaven’s sake, man, 
get started.” 

Reluctantly, Baxter reached for 
the phone. 



THE SILKIC

A s Cemp expected, he began 
his change en route. By the 
time he was put aboard the Kibma- 
dine ship, he was already in a tank 
of water in his first compulsive 
change, which was to the fish state. 

He would be a class B Silkie for 
slightly more than two months. 

As Di-isarill came finally to the 
tiny ship in its remote orbit beyond 
Pluto, he noticed at once that the 
entrance mechanism had been tam- 
pered with, and he sensed the pres- 
ence of Cemp aboard. 

In the course of countless millen- 
nia his fear reflexes had fallen into 
disuse. So he had no anxiety. But he 
recognized that here was all the ap- 
pearance of a trap. 

In a flash, he checked to insure 
that there was no source of ener- 
gy aboard that could destroy him. 
There was none; no relay; nothing. 

A faint energy emanated from the 
tank. But it had no purpose that Di- 
isarill could detect. 

He wondered scathingly if these 
human beings expected somehow to 
work a bluff whereby he would be 
impelled by uncertainty to stay away 
from his own ship. 

With that thought, he activated 
the entrance mechanism, entered, 
transformed to human, walked over 
to the tank that stood in the center 
of the tiny ‘ cabin — and looked 
down at Cemp, who lay at the bot- 
tom. 

Di-isarill said, ‘Tf it’s a bluff, I 
couldn’t possibly yield to it because 
I have nowhere else that I can go.” 
In his fish state, Cemp could hear 



and understand human words but 
could not speak them. 

Di-isarill persisted: “It’s interest- 
ing that the one Silkie whom I can- 
not read has taken the enormous 
risk of coming aboard. Perhaps you 
were more affected by the desire I 
attempted to rouse in your home 
than appeared at the time. Perhaps 
you long for the ecstasy and the an- 
guish that I offered.” 

Cemp was thinking tensely: “It’s 
working. He doesn’t notiee how he 
got onto that subject.” 

The logic of levels was beginning 
to take effect. 

I t was a strange world, the 
world of logic. For nearly all 
of his long history, man had been 
moved by unsuspected mechanisms 
in his brain and nervous system. A 
sleep center put him to sleep. A 
waking center woke him up. A rage 
mechanism mobilized him for at- 
tack. A fear complex propelled him 
to flight. There were a hundred or 
more other mechanisms, each with 
its special task for him, each in it- 
self a marvel of perfect functioning 
but degraded by his uncomprehend- 
ing obedience to a chance triggering 
of one or another. 

During this period, all civilization 
consisted of codes of honor and 
conduct and of attempts noble and 
ignoble to rationalize the unknown 
simplicities underneath. Finally, 
came a developing comprehension 
and control of the neural mechan- 
isms, one, then another, then many. 
The real age of reason began. 

On the basis of that reason Cemp 
asked himself: Was the Kibmadine

level lower, or higher, than for 
example the shark? 

It was lower, he decided. The 
comparison would be, if man had 
brought cannibalism into civilization 
with him. A lower level of logic ap- 
plied to that. 

The shark was relatively pure 
within his frame. He lived by the 
feedback system, in a pretty good 
balance. He did not age, as humans 
did. He grew older — and longer. 

It was a savagely simple system. 
Keep in motion: that was the law 
of it. What poetry that motion was, 
in the wide, deep sea that had 
spawned him! But it was — feel 
need of oxygen, get excited, swim 
faster; enough oxygen, slow, cruise, 
even stop. But not for long. Mov- 
ment continuous — life. 

Eating, of itself, was lower, more 
basic, went farther back into the an- 
tiquity of the cell. 

And so, the mighty Kibmadine 
had brought into their innumerable 
forms one pattern that was vulner- 
able. one they wouldn’t give up, no 
matter how much they controlled 
the other basic mechanisms of their 
bodies . 

D i-isarill was calm as he sped 
through space. He sensed that 
he had subtly managed to influence 
Cemp to the fear of intolerable re- 
taliation. Unfortunate that the 
Silkie had analyzed the Kibmadine 
structure so accurately. It made di- 
rect reading of Cemp’s feelings and 
thoughts difficult. 

Not that it mattered. Under other 
circumstances. Earth might well 
have been a planet to be destroyed. 



But there was no chance at all of 
enough Silkies being produced in 
time to save the system from being 
conquered. 

And so another race would, one 
at a time, experience the ecstasy of 
being eaten as the culmination of the 
act of love. 

. What a joy it was to receive 
from tens of millions of cells! First 
resistance, terror, shrinking;, and 
then the inversion: every part of the 
being craving to be eaten, longing, 
begging, demanding — 

Di-isarill’s calmness yielded to ex- 
citement, as the pictures and the 
feelings re-formed in his mind, from 
ten thousand remembered feasts of 
love-objects. 

“I really loved them all,” he 
thought sadly. 

Too bad they were not brought 
up to appreciate in advance the ul- 
timate delight of the all-consuming 
end of the sex orgy. 

It had always bothered Di-isarill 
that the preliminaries had to be se- 
cret, particularly with beings who 
had the ability to transmit thoughts 
to others of their kind and thus warn 
them. The greatest pleasure alwayi 
came when the ending was known, 
when part of the love play consist- 
ed of reassuring the troubled, trein- 
bling being, quieting the pounding 
heart. 

“Some day,” he told thousands of 
love partners, “I shall meet someone 
who will eat me. And when that 
happens — ” 

Always he had tried to persuade 
them that he would rejoice as he 
was being devoured. 

The inversion involved was e

phenomenon of the life condition: 
first, resistance, terror, shrinking; 
then every part of the being craving 
to be eaten, longing, begging, de- 
manding. The urge to succumb 
could be as powerful as the urge to 
survive. 

Standing there in front of the 
tank, looking down at Cemp, Di- 
isarill felt a quickening of emotion 
as the conjuration of himself being 
eaten flitted like a fantasy through 
his brain. He had had such pictures 
before but never before so strong. 

He did not notice that he had 
passed the point of no return. 

W ithout thinking, he turned 
away from the tank. Cemp 
forgotten, he transformed quickly 
into a remembered form, long- 
necked, with smooth dappled skin 
and powerful teeth. He remembered 
the form well and lovingly. The 
members of the race had been love 
objects for the Kibmadine not too 
long ago. Their bodies had a par- 
ticularly excruciating pleasure nerve 
system. 

Di-isarill could scarcely wait. 

Even as he became the form, his 
long neck twisted. A moment later 
the teeth, impelled by the merciless 
Kibmadine biting drive, cut off an 
entire thigh. 

The pain was so hideous he 
screamed. But in his enchanted brain 
the scream was only an echo 
of the countless screams that his bite 
had evoked in the past. Now, as 
then, the sound excited him almost 
beyond endurance. He bit deeper. 



champed harder, at faster. 

He devoured nearly one half of 
his own body before the imminence 
of death brought a baby fear from 
his own true past. Whimpering, 
blindly longing for home, he opened 
a line to his contact on the planet 
of the far sun where his kind now 
dwelt. 

At that instant an outside force 
surged past him and overwhelmed 
his personal communication. As one, 
a dozen Silkies loaded an electric 
charge on that line, all they believed 
it could carry. 

The charge that struck the distant 
Kibmadine totalled more than 80- 
000 volts and over 140,000 am- 
peres of electricity. It was so power- 
ful it smashed all his reflex defenses 
and burnt him in a single puff of 
flame and smoke. 

As quickly as it had opened, the 
line ceased to exist. The Sol system 
was now only an anonymous, distant 
star. 

T 'he tank with Cemp in it was 
carried to the ocean. He crawled 
out into the sea, breasted the incom- 
ing tide. 

The bubbling fresh liquid poured 
through his gills. As he reached the 
deeper water, he submerged. Soon 
the thunder of the surf was behind 
him. Ahead was a blue sea and the 
great underwater shelf where a col- 
ony of class B Silkies lived their fish- 
like existence. 

He would dwell in their domed 
cities with them ... for a time.
