THE GREAT INVENTIONS 


A s semi-professional crystal- 
ball gazers, we science-fiction 
types share a community of inter- 
est with budget-makers, city plan- 
ners, airline traffic managers and 
all sorts of other people whose 
principal occupation is to make 
statements today about what is 
likely to happen tomorrow. 

Everything considered, it’s our 
opinion that the wide-ranging 
view of the average Galaxy wri- 
ter is less likely to be appallingly 
wrong than even the best-based 
projection of the specialist, mak- 
ing predictions about his own 
field. We think there is a reason 
for this, and we think the reason 
is worth a little consideration. 

Take one of the great new in- 


ventions at random — say, the 
hologram. 

There’s no doubt that the holo- 
gram is a fascinating piece 
of technology. Three-dimensional 
virtual images, an eerie ability to 
look behind the objects in the 
forefront of what you find your- 
self thinking of as a photograph 
— no question about it, it’s inter- 
esting, it’s unprecedented, and 
sooner or later it’s going to prove 
mighty useful. 

But — useful at what, exactly? 

There’s really no way to telL 
One thing we do know: Any 
present study about the future 
of the hologram, considering noth- 
ing but the hologram, is certain 
to be simplistic, incomplete — 
and just plain wrong.

Tfie reason we say this is sim- 
ple. Tfie dialectic of society does 
not allow any development to oc- 
cur in a vacuum. Tfie things 
tfiat transform tfie world are not 
single gadgets; tfiey are gestalts. 
For instance, we talk about “tfie 
automobile revolution”, and cer- 
tainly tfie pfienomenon we mean 
wfien we say tfiat Has radically 
altered all our lives. But what is 
“tfie automobile revolution”? 

It isn’t one invention; it’s more 
like a dozen. At least. It is tfie 
product of Ford’s assembly line, 
plus Goodyear’s rubber, plus 
Otto’s engine, plus Macadam’s - 
Hardtop roads — plus sucfi otfier 
inventions as tfie crucial one of 
installment buying. 

Take away any one of tfiese 
tilings, and you Have no “auto- 
mobile revolution”. You fiave 
something quite different, and far 
less significant. Nobody invented 
tfie automobile. (Nobody invent- 
ed tfie airplane or tfie I CBM or 
television or tfie computer, 
either.) Wliat Happened in tfie 
case of tfie automobile is tfiat a 
lot of different people came up 
with a lot of different innova- 
tions, large and small, technolo- 
gical and social — and tfie result 
in 1968 is Highway deaths, a mo- 
bile population, new kinds of sta- 
tus symbols and air pollution. 

So to know wliat Holograms 
will signify 50 years from now, 


you must be able to make some 
sort of guess at any number of 
simultaneously occurring changes. 

F or example — care to predict 
tfie future of rocket trans- 
port? 

Teclinologically, tfiat joH is 
easy. Tfie materials exist rigfit at 
Hand. A Douglas scientist named 
Pfiilip Bone already lias on tfie 
drawing boards wliat fie calls a 
Hyperion, a rocket wfiicfi could 
carry a thousand people anywfiere 
in tfie world in 45 minutes, in- 
dependent of traffic patterns and 
even of landing fields. 

But, although tfie technology is 
pretty straightforward, tfie ques- 
tion of whether sucfi transports 
will ever fly depends on some 
ratfier remote-seeming other con- 
tingencies, including tfie prospects 
of putting domes over our cities 
and tfie likelihood of a general 
disarmament treaty. 

Why tfiese two? Simple. A: THe 
noise level of rocket transports is 
even more Horrendous than that 
of tfie SST, wfiicfi is already in- 
tolerable. It is almost certainly 
out of tfie question for them to 
take off or land anywfiere near a 
city (and there’s not much point 
in landing them anywfiere else), 
unless tfie people in tfie city can 
be insulated from tfie “sound pol- 
lution” — and about tfie only 
immediately visible practicable 


5 



way of doing that is through put- 
ting Buckminster Fuller’s domes 
over the cities. And B: The big 
roadblock for rocket liners, as for 
that matter for SSTs, is finding 
a way to pay for the development 
costs. Basically these are now met 
out of (defense funds, one way or 
another; but given disarmament, 
the defense money dries up . 
and either we find a new way of 
funding R&D or we don’t have 
rocket liners. 

'T'lie other thing wrong with 
straight-line predictions about 
the future of technological inno- 
vations is that all too often they 
miss the point of what the inno- 
vation is really going to be good 
for. Innovations aren’t used in a 
.vacuum, either. 

Take computers. There is not 
a science-based shop in the coun- 
try where you can’t get an argu- 
ment on The Future of the Com- 
puter, or Whether Machines Can 
Really Think. 

Strikes us that this is a pitifully 
trivial argument. It’s like looking 
at a newborn child, and wonder- 
ing about the future of his left 
arm. 

What is important about the 
future of a child is not what will 
happen to any of his members, 
but what will happen to the 
whole organism; and what is im- 
portant about the future of com- 


puters is what will happen 
to servo-systems, man-machine 
symbioses and still-un guessed so- 
cial constructs in which compu- 
ters play a part. 

A man using a computer can 
function as though he has (which, 
functionally speaking, is the 
same as has) an I.Q. anywhere 
from 10 to 50 points higher than 
bis unaided score. That is what 
is important about computers — 
not what the machine can do, 
but what the man-machine sym- 
biosis can do. The implications go 
far beyond the present horizons 
of expediting scientific research 
or selling airline tickets; they in- 
clude the excellent possibility 
that all of us can pick up those 
functional extra I.Q. points and 
use them in our daily lives. 

And there is a revolution that 
makes the automobile look pretty 
trivial. If nothing else, think of 
the retarded 10% of the human 
race; and think of them 
equipped with, say, wristwatch- 
sized remote-access computer 
consoles. Now they can navigate 
city streets by themselves; now 
they can hold jobs; now they can 
rejoin the human race. 

Somebody once said that a 
good science-fiction story should 
be able to predict not the automo- 
bile but the traffic jam. We agree. 
And so should good science.

^ One Station of the Way 



— and the Story had another end ! 


*T'he paired moons Daurya and 
Sonista were both still higH 
in the night, although they had 
begun their descent toward the 
flat western horizon. The stars 
that showed in the heavens were 
few and dim, even in the east 

Suddenly a new one appeared 
(here — bright, white and daz- 
zling as a cut sunstone. 

The three hominids, heavily 
robed and cowled against the 
desert, which thirsted for their 
moisture, swiftly, dismounted 
from the high-backed chair-sad- 
dles of their cameloids, knelt in 
the sand, which was cold above, 
but still hot below, and did the 
new star reverence, rhythmically 
swaying forward their planted 


spears in time with the slow bob- 
bing of their heads. 

The star in the east grew 
brighter still and began to de- 
scend. 

One hominid said, “It is a sign 
from God. Blessed Wife and 
Husband are where we thought 
them.” 

Another agreed, "They are 
there, our Chosen Ones, under 
the falling star. It is indeed a 
sign. Those who seek, find — if 
they be unwearying of heart 
mind and senses.” 

Even as they spoke, the star, 
grown piercingly bright, winked 
out. It was difficult to tell wheth- 
er it Had been extinguished, or 
had dropped behind a dune. The 


43 


latter seemed likely, since there 
was a pale semicircular glow 
where the star Had been. But 
then the glow vanisfied too. 

Springing to His feet, the tfiird 
hominid said, “Let us He after 
them* before the fix fades from 
our minds.” 

“Indeed yes,” tfie first second- 
ed as He rose. “We must remem- 
ber that we have for tfiem * . 
our gifts.” 

“Let us fiaste, cousin,” tfie 
second urged, rising too. 

Faintly revealed fiy tfie ligfit 
of Sonista and Daurya, tfie three 
hominids were stranger front 
side than back. Smiling together 
as they conferred, they eacfi 
showed three eyes, one where a 
nose would be on a Terran face, 
while their smiling mouths were 
long, going almost from trumpet 
ear to trumpet ear. 

They remounted and went 
down the slope of tfie dune at 
a lope which made tfie sand hiss 
very faintly under their came- 
loids’ hooves. On tfie three ret- 
inas of each' Hominid and con- 
joined in eacfi of their brains, 
the after-image of tfie star still 
burned, a tiny ball blacker than 
tfie night. 

TT'ive dunes ahead, Wife stared 
' afright yet paralyzed at the 
fantastic sight — fantastic even 
on that most fantastic world, 
Finiswar, where except among 

44 


the most evolved and intelligent 
types, monsters were the rule and 
true-breeds the exception. 

Wife could Hear Husband’s 
heart thud, although he stood at 
a short distance from Her. Hold- 
ing Her either hand, peeping 
around Her robes, were small rep- 
licas of Husband and Herself. Sfie 
could feel their Hearts beating, 
not a-fear, but quietly as wfien 
they nursed or slept 

All four b'eings were visaged 
and robed like the three fiomin- 
ids riding the cameloids. 

Wife thought in a tiny active 
comer of her frozen mind: The 
little ones do not fear strange- 
ness, at least so long as I Hold 
their Hands. TKey open them- 
selves to all tfie world. Could 
that be good? TKey do not armor 
themselves against it, as a wom- 
an armors Herself against all 
stray and errant seeds and 
against all lovers save one, after 
she cuts Her middle teeth and 1 
they are grown razor sharp. 

But could opening oneself ever 
be good, except in childhood, 
when one lives fantasies parent- 
protected? Love is a tunnel seal- 
ed at both ends, the wise say, 
never the forest and sea and sky. 

What Wife stared at a-quake, 
though now with growing won- 
der, were two gigantic serpents, 
each as thick as Husband but 
three times as tall in their for- 
ward thirds alone that swayed 


GALAXY 



upright like a white and a black 
tree in the wind. The foremost 
was pallid as Daurya. The one 
that lurked behind with his swol- 
len Head swaying into view, now 
to the right of his pale compan- 
ion, now to the left, was dark as 
moonless night. 

Or perhaps they were more 
properly millipeds than serpents, 
for from each’s ventral side, now 
facing Wife, grew ranks and 
ranks of stubby-fingered feet, 
many of the fingers nervously 
a-writhe. These fingered feet grew 
thickest under the great serpent 
heads. This, although Wife 
could not know it, was so that 
the two serpents could crawl ef- 
fectively on a max-grav planet. 
Here on Finiswar, which was as 
small as Terra, the head-feet 
were of little need. 

Behind them, blurred to Wife’s 
three eyes, because their focus 
was ever on the serpents, stood 
the slender and strangely finned 
spoonmetal spire from which two 
extra-Finiswarians had emerged, 
and which Had burned like an 
unended candle, its flame blind- 
ingly white, as it had descended. 

Now the pallid serpent, its 
trunk reared up scarce two steps 
away from Wife, lowered its flaf 
head to inspect her point by 
point over her cowled head and 
robed body. He studied her from 
the black holes in his two great 
eyes that were like two mollust- 

ONE STATION OF THE WAY 


jewels, white as his scales but 
even more fluorescently glitter- 
ing. He traced her form. From 
time to time he lightly touched 
her with his ghost-white, narrow, 
trifid tongue. 

She could hear Husband’s 
heart thunder, though he stood 
still as stone. The children, how- 
ever, were merely curious. She 
knew without looking down that 
her daughter was stretching a 
thin arm toward the serpent. 
While her own heart was thud- 
ding, but she no longer knew if 
it were thudding with' fear, even 
when the shivery, shocking 
tongue touched her lips. 

She did not know that she was 
filled with a wild, almost unbear- 
able excitement. It made Her won- 
der. It made her question every- 
thing she knew. 

• 

S he fought the answers Her feel- 
ings gave. Not Tins inti- 
mate gentle, imperious searching 
never, never, never, could be 
love, she told herself. Love was 
a needle in the dark, the one 
right needle amidst a trillion 
wrong ones. Love was something 
the woman controlled and tested 
at every instant, her senses in- 
creasingly alert from periphery 
to center, her will a trillion times 
as ready to deal death as to wel- 
come life. Love had nothing to 
do with this paralyzed submis- 
sion. Love was not Daurya and 

45 



Sonista ceaselessly staring at 
each’ other as they circled each’ 
other for all eternity. Rather, it 
was the needle-pointed spear 
which one permitted to strike in 
the dark. 

Moreover, love had to do only 
with' h’ominids. Or rather it had 
to do with one chosen Hominid 
only, not with a gigantic serpent 
weirder than a magnified jungle 
flower, a jewel-crusted great sea- 
snake, a rainbow bird whose 
wings spanned trees. And yet, 
and yet. 

But, if by some impossibility it 
should be love, what was the 
meaning of the pallid lord’s dark 
brother? — whose ebon head and 
jet eyes followed closely every 
movement of the pallid lord’s flat 
face, now dipping in from one 
side, now from the other, watch- 
ing every touching though not 
quite ever close enough to touch 
with his own black tongue, which 
was slender, trifid and blurring- 
ly a-tremble. Love was for two, 
not three. Was he the pallid 
lord’s true brother, to be accept- 
ed with honor? Or was He to be 
hated as the pallid lord was to 
be loved? Or was he in truth 
only a shadow? More substantial 
than other shadows, a shadow 
with’ depth' as well as breadth and 
height, but still only a shade, an 
unvarying adjunct of the pallid 
lord? 

And yet, and yet . what else 
46 


but love could be the excitement 
turned glory that now filled her, 
filled her almost to fainting as 
the serpent’s great Head paused, 
so that she felt the tongue's 
triple trembling through her robe, 
before the great Head lifted back 
and away. 

The First Mate, for such was. 
the office of the black serpent, 
murmur-hissed softly, “you spent 
some appreciative time there, you 
old lech’erl Your spermapositor 
Had its kicks. I believe you do 
your whole work solely for your 
enjoyment of these moments.” 
“Silence, filth,” the Captain 
replied. “The work must always 
be done softly, gently and with 
greatest care, since its object is 
a mustardseed that eventually 
will fill all earth and sky.” 

“I’ve guessed it. You’re grow- 
ing sentimental,” the First Mate 
jeered. “Mustardseed! Why, you 
must be remembering that world 
— how many implantings wag 
it back? — called Terra or Gaea 
or something like that. One of 
your more notable failures.” 
“One of my notable successes,” 
the Captain contradicted. 

“I don’t see how. As I recall, 
his people killed him most pain- 
fully. And we Had later reports 
of even more disastrous conse- 
quences.” 

tt'C'xactly! — they killed Him. 
■*“' And by that death he emo- 

GALAXY 



tionally and mentally fecundated 
his whole world. You still don’t 
understand my methods. Obser- 
vation has only made your blind 
spots blacker. My son died, but 
his ideas — the idea of love — 
lived on.” 

“In utterly distorted forms,” 
the First Mate pronounced, 
“eventually turning Half that race 
into utter preys, into victims 
even more cringing than before 
your 'great work,’ the other half 
into still more merciless hunters. 
A schizophrenic split in the col- 
lective unconscious. At last re- 
port, the folk of that planet were 
being ruled by fear and greed, 
while the great nations were pre- 
paring to destroy each other with 
chemical, biological and nuclear 
weapons.” 

“True enough. Yet they’d only 
prepared, not done it,” the Cap- 
tain countered. “For love to win, 
great risks must be boldly taken. 
But without love there’s no hope 
at all — only the unending chase 
of hunters and preys. Dangerous? 
Of course love isl Always I start 
from a point near death, like this 
desert here, and work toward 
life. Then — ” 

“OH, yes, this desertl” the First 
Mate interrupted sardonically. 
“That other planet had a desert 
too. And it had heavily robed 
featherless bipeds, and cameloid 
beasts, and a moon. Finiswar here 
Has reminded you of it. 


“Besides that, you Save a 
thing about deserts. They ap- 
peal to your asceticism, They 
fit with your ever more ascetic 
matings and also to your grow- 
ing flirtatiousness with death, an 
aspect of your feelings for which 
you have a vast blind spot In- 
cidentally, I believe this desert 
is different Most of my compu- 
ter’s probes Haven’t reported back 
yet but I already have an intui- 
tion. An intuition that is a warn- 
ing to you: don’t trust the an- 
alogy between Terra and Finis- 
war too far. In fact, don’t trust 
it at all.” 

“You and your computer and 
its probes 1 Forever seeking to 
dissect the universe to the last 
particle. Forever seeking to dis- 
prove empathy and similar ity 
and oneness. You’ll never find 
love that way.” 

“True, I won’t — because it’s 
not there l- There are only vanity 
and desire. Besides, you have 
your computer and its probes too, 
though you pretend they’re only 
a technological trifle. Despite 
which, they always manage to 
echo your profound judgments.” 

TTTife, floating in a sea of 
* ’ glory distantly shored with 
fear, hearing as if they were wind 
on sand the hissings and mur- 
murings of Captain and First 
Mate, now suddenly felt the ten- 
tative tiny touch of an alien seed 


ONE STATION OF THE WAY 


47 



on her poignantly sensitive raz- 
or-sharp teeth. 

At first she was only gently 
startled. The desert was the 
(place of no-seed. There were 
some seeds everywhere, like 
spores of* plague. Nevertheless, 
the scarcity of alien seed was wKy 
she and Husband had come here. 

Then all at once she realized 
it must be the seed of the great 
white snake. It Had the same con- 
stant vibrancy in its movements, 
the same gentle imperiousness. 
She felt it cross and recross her 
bite, questingly. Then she parted 
Her teeth a little, and it slowly 
crawled in. 

For a long moment she could 
have sliced it in two, and her 
every instinct, almost, was to do 
so, although her median teeth 
were chiefly for decapitating 
(seed-depositing organs. But it 
was a larger seed, bigger than one 
of her eggs, and she could readi- 
ly have destroyed it so. 

Yet she did not, for it carried 
the same glory with it as had the 
serpent’s tongue. The tongue had 
been glory diffused. This was 
glory concentrated into a needle. 

Now the alien seed was in the 
poison passage. But all the poi- 
son pores in it remained closed. 

So did the digestive pores. 
(Some lazy single females lived 
on seeds and their depositing or- 
gans alone, using their facial 
mouths only to breathe and 

48 


drink. A female could do that on 
seed-thick-Finiswar — that is, 
anywhere except the mountains 
and deserts.) 

And now the alien seed, vi- 
brant, insistent, had reached the 
wall of doors. Wife could feel 
every movement of its progress, 
every tiniest touching. It Had 
passed within a membrane’s 
thickness of poisons that could 
destroy any and all life. 

The dozen doors that led loop- 
ing back to the chambers be- 
neath the poison pores remained 
tight shut. The one true door 
opened. 

Another deadly but unharm- 
ing passage having been trav- 
ersed, the doubly alien seed was 
in Wife’s centralmost and most 
sensitive volume, asceptic save 
for Her waiting egg. 

And her egg which was only 
partly under her mind’s control, 
did not employ any of the weap- 
ons of evasion, defense and coun- 
terattack at its disposal, but re- 
ceived the alien seed, which melt- 
ed the egg’s outer skin with the 
enzymes of a million Terran-type 
sperm. 

Husband, his Heart still racing, 
whispered, “Why are you smil- 
ing?” 

“1 smile because we are in a 
place of no-seed, except yours,” 
she whispered back. “I smile be- 
cause Daurya and Sonista curt- 
sey around each other charming- 


GALAXY 



ly as they set. But chiefly I 
smile because the serpents spar- 
ed us, and their star did not bum 
tis down, though we felt its great 
heat.” 

“For those last you should 
feel relief,” he told her coldly. “I 
asked — Why are you smiling?” 

She did not answer. She knew 
that he knew and could not be 
fooled. It was as certain as the 
tight, hot clasp of her daughter- 
duplicate’s little hand on hers, 
as the way Husband-duplicate’s 
hand chilled and almost fell 
away from her looping fingers. 
Even the children knew. 

Yes, Husband knew. And he 
would first punish, then divorce, 
send her off alone into sterilest 
and hottest no-seed, try even to 
take from her daughter-dupli- 
cate. 

But even that would be a glo- 
ry, a glory at least in the end. 
She would bear a daughter who 
would have the serpent’s love, 
a daughter who would change 
all Finiswar, a daughter who 
would bring love at last to the 
whole world of hating and ex- 
cluding and killing. Yes, it would 
be a great glory. 

nphe Captain was saying, “It 
-*• has taken, you can tell. Her 
smile is like the other’s.” 

“You are sentimentalizing 1” 
the black First Mate rejoined. 
“Night, moon or moons, desert, a

willing female — what planet 
has not these? I tell you plainly, 
if you keep looking for similari- 
ties with Terra, you are in few 
some nasty shocks — yea, and 
deadly danger too.” 

“Not so,” the Captain contra- 
dicted calmly. “Also, the simi- 
larities continue, for here — be- 
hold! — - come the Three Kings.” 

Slithering down the dime so si- 
lently neither Husband nor Wife 
heard them, came the three robed 
and cowled hominids. Their 
richly caparisoned cameloids had 
been left beyond the top. 

Behind Husband, the first bo- 
mi nid raised his arm, as if in 
salutation, then drew it back. 

From a small gleaming instru- 
ment held in a fingered foot just 
below the head of the First Mate, 
who now reared up as steady as 
an ebony temple column, a bril- 
liant scarlet needle-beam took 
that hominid in shoulder, chest 
and throat. And as the second 
hominid raised his arm, it took 
him too. 

A brilliant white needle-beam, 
shooting sideways from a similar 
instrument the Captain had pro- 
duced, neatly took off that fin- 
gered foot of the First Mate 
which had held the scarlet-spit- 
ting weapon. 

The last hominid raised his 
arm and hurled. The Captain 
swayed sideways fast enough to 
save his life, but not — entirely 


49 



— his skin. The whirring spear 
transfixed a fold of it, barely 
penetrating below the scaled epi- 
dermis, and dangled from the 
Captain’s neck. 

With . another instrument as 
quickly produced, the First Mate 
shot down the last of the intru- 
ders. Then He gave the whistling 
hiss that was His laugh. 

The Captain’s nearest finger- 
ed feet explored the lodgement 
of the spear and finding it shal- 
low, tore it loose and cast if 
away on the sand. His fingered 
feet moved swiftly enough in do- 
ing this, but all the rest of Him 
appeared to be shocked numb. 

Wife and Husband had drop- 
ped to their knees, while daugh- 
ter- and son-duplicates were hid- 
den in Wife’s robe. 

The First Mate turned off his 
Hateful laugh at last and mur- 
mur-Kissed as Hatefully, “Yes, 
there is in my mind no doubt 
but that the Three Wise Men 
came to Kill Husband and rape 
Wife. And I fancy that on Finis- 
war rape is a 'most curious and 
prolonged business. You will ad- 
mit now, will you not, my Cap- 
tain, that at least in one particu- 
lar your analogy between Terra 
and Finiswar lacked rigor?” 

The Captain still did not move. 
Then a great shiver traveled 
down His scales. 

The First Mate laughed again, 
briefly and sardonically. “Well, 


your great work is finished, is it 
not? I mean, on Finiswar, at least. 
My probes Have returned to my 
computer. So yours Have to yours 
I presume. In any case, I suggest 
we depart at once, before we meet 
any shepherds, perchance.” 

Now at last the Captain nod- 
ded. Once. Dumbly. 

While Husband and Wife con- 
tinued to kneel and stare, the 
two great serpents lowered their 
proud trunks and swiftly crawl- 
ed on their bellies back to their 
ship. 

L ater, in the control room of 
Inseminator, they argued 
the whole matter. Their great 
looped forms looked at Home in 
the silvery room, their fingered 
feet fitting themselves to the but- 
tons and control holes of the mul- 
tiple consoles as occasion re- 
quired. The argument began with 
desultory comment, followed by 
a “report” by the First Mate, 
delivered coolly but with acid 
cynicism. 

The Captain said, “I still 
do not see why they should 
Have tried to spear me. It was 
you who was shooting at them.” 
The First Mate explained, “At 
first they were simply trying to 
spear Husband. Thereafter, be- 
ing attacked, they naturally 
tried to kill their attacker. You, 
being white, stood out in the 
dark. I didn’t. .There are advan-

tages in being black. We were 
close togetKer, and the last Ho- 
minid aimed at the one of us 
Ke could see. A matter of purely 
physical black and wHite, you 
understand. I doubt they sensed 
your hypothetical spiritual light 
at all — or my spiritual negation 
of liglit, for tHat matter.” 

“I was going to ask your par- 
don for sbooting off your foot,” 
tKe Captain said. “But since you 
Eave made it an occasion for one 
of your materialistic diatribes — ” 

“NevertEeless, I freely grant 
you my forgiveness, for wfiat it’s 
wortli.” 

“Very well. Now let me Have 
your computer’s evaluation of 
Finiswar.” 

TEe First Mate nodded his 
flat Head. Settling fiis dark coils 
more comfortably around their 
metal “tree,” Be began: 

“Interpreting the materials 
gatHered and tHe observations 
made by its probes, my computer 
Has determined that the chief 
mode of reproduction on Finis- 
war is partHogenesis. THe boy- 
child being identical with Hus- 
band and tfie girl-cfiild witfi 
Wife sEould Have been enough to 
tell you that and was enough to 
tell me.” 

Tfie First Mate chuckled, His 
trifid tongue a blur of black vi- 
bration, and continued, “There 
is good reason, my computer tells 
me, for partfiogenesis on Finig- 

ONE STATION OF THE WAY 


war and for the unusual armor- 
ing and arming of female geni- 
talia there. For Finiswar has a bi- 
ology that is genetically wide 
open. Interspecial breeding of 
any sort, no matter How wide the 
gap between mating organisms, 
is possible and fertile. There are 
literally no lethal genes on Finis- 
war, and no offspring, no matter 
how monstrous, which cannot 
live at least a little while. 

“Yet sexual breeding within 
species is possible there, provid- 
ed the coupling beasts take suf- 
ficient precaution. There again 
the fortress-like female genitals 
are essential, to kill off all false 
sperm. While an intelligent spe- 
cies, such as the hominids, seeks 
out for breeding purposes as arid 
and sterile an area as possible, 
such as the desert we found them 
in. Else, despite all precautions, 
a female might be impregnated 
by a flower or a fish or a mic- 
robe or a glitter-winged insect 
, . or a serpent, a wise old ser- 
pent. 

“Yes,” the First Mate contin- 
ued after another of his chuckles, 
“Finiswar is in a small way rath- 
er like our planet — or should I 
call it your planet? — since you 
are the only one paranoid enough 
to think it a great work to spread 
your seed across the universe. 
Husband’s gon and Wife’s daugh- 
ter were both analogous to your 
seed parthenogenetically grown 

51 



to full creature. However, they of 
Finlswar are more modest. They 
do not encode their seed with 
great ideas — love and such — 
and force them on all the infin- 
itely varied breeds of being the 
stars boast, think thereby to 
bring ‘peace’ — your peace! to 
all.” 

tt Qilence!” the Captain said at 
^ last with a writhe of dis- 
gust. “Despite all your mocking, 
my computer says there is a 
point seven nine probability that 
Wife will bear a child glorious- 
ly — ” 

“My computer says point eight 
three on that,” the First Mate 
broke in titteringly. “But you’re 
wrong about the gloriously part. 
Wife will receive no adulation 
and reverent care. Instead she 
will be tortured by Husband, 
her parthenogenetic daughter 
taken from her and killed, and 
she driven out from her family 
and tribe to suffer. Oh, she 
will — ” 

“Trifles!” the Captain hissed 
majestically. “Despite all, she will 
produce a son who will — ” 

“A daughter,” the First Mate 
contradicted. “By a point nin e 
eight probability.” 

“Yes, a daughter, you’re right 
there,” the Captain admitted ir- 
ritably. “My computer echoes 
yours. But what matter? She 
won’t be the first female savior, 

52 


as you well know. The only point 
of importance is that Wife will 
give birth to a being who will 
preach the gospel of love all 
across Finiswar, so eloquently 
that none will be able to resist! 
Hate and murderousness will 
vanish. Greed and envy will 
wither away. Love alone — ” 

“And what will that mean . 
on Finiswar?” the First Mate in- 
terrupted incisively, his great 
head halting in the natural sway- 
ing it maintained in free fall. “I 
will tell you. It will mean that 
the females of Finiswar, at least 
the hominid females, will open 
themselves to all seeds. There will 
be a great birthing of fantastical 
monsters. Exotic flowers with 
three-eyed heads set amidst their 
petals. Hominids crested and 
finned like fish, but not likely 
showing gills. Rainbow birds 
with wide mouths instead of 
beaks and arms instead of wings. 
Beings even more fantastical — 
insects that glitter and speak, an- 
imalcula that peer with pleading 
treble eye through the microscope 
from the viewing plate. Spiders 
that — ” 

“Enough!” the Captain com- 
manded. “My computer tells me 
that the chances for a stabilized, 
still selectively breeding race of 
loving hominids on Finiswar are 
. well point one seven,” he 
added defiantly. 

The First Mate shrugged all 

GALAXY 



along His body’s length. “On that, 
my computer says point oh oh 
three.” 

“Your computer is biased!” 
“Not as much as yours, I fan- 
cy. Remember, you Have a great 
work, I am only the observer. 
No, the overwhelming chances 
are for one jeweled and gemmed 
generation on Finiswar, like an 
uncontrollable growth of crys- 
tals of every angularity and Hue, 
like a beautiful cancer — freaks 
to please a mad emperor! — 
and then . the end. At least 
for the Hominids.” 

“What matter?” the Captain 
demanded stubbornly. “It will be 
an end with love. That is enough.” 
“OH, you Have at last solved 
the problem of Death?” the First 
Mate asked innocently. Then, 
after a moment, with His Hissing 
laugh, “No, you have not as 
I can see. On Finiswar at 
least, your Highly touted love 
will end in Death, just as 
it promises to do on longer-suf- 
fering Terra. Myself, I still ad- 
mire most the beings who rise up 
and do battle against Death. 
And even the creatures that flee 
Death, the ones who are the eter- 
nal prey — those I admire more 
too, though not as greatly. The 
•layer is always more admirable 
than the slain, for he survives.” 
"That endless circling, bloody 
chase of the hunters and the 
prey? You can admire that?” 

ONE STATION OF THE WAY 


“Why not? If s all there is to 
admire. Besides, it forces both 
basic types of being to develop 
velocity, first to swim through 
water, run on land and fly 
through air. Finally, to speed 
through sub-space, even as we 
do. And to achieve that last re- 
quires the development of high 
intelligence and brilliant imag- 
ination, qualities which nicely 
embellish both the best of hunt- 
era and the best of prey. I al- 
ways admire good decor.” 

“I detest you in this mood,” 
the Captain said flatly. “You 
have been the companion of all 
my wanderings, and still you will 
not admit the primacy of Love. 
You cannot even bring yourself 
to think of what might happen 
if the prey fled so swiftly that, 
like a guilty conscience, they 
caught up with the Hunters along 
the great circles of the cosmos.” 
“Metaphysics!” was the First 
Mate’s only comment, delivered 
with great contempt. 

“You scorn me and toy works,” 
the Captain said. “Yet you de- 
vote your entire existence to ob- 
serving me and them. If they are 
valueless, why?” 

F or the first time, the First 
Mate was at a loss for an 
answer. Finally he hissed, “Per- 
haps it amuses me to watch you 
do your work of destruction, 
calling it Love — a love which 


53 



only weakens the Hunter’s lust to 
pursue and the prey’s panic to 
escape. Using Love, you’d leecti 
out of the universe its finest 
fighting stocks, its cleverest eva- 
ders. Nevertheless,” he continued 
flatly, “has not Finiswar at last 
taught you that your great work 
is useless, tending always toward 
Death rather than Life? All your 
savior-children — every last one 
of them — are mules unable even 
to reproduce themselves. They 
are spokesmen for Death! I sug- 
gest you end it all, this instant. 
Negate the Inseminator’s fix on 
the next planet, and set a course 
for home.” 

“Never!” said the Captain. 
“Wherever it leads — into what- 
ever seeming horrors — Love is 
primal!”

“Oh, that is sweet. That is ex- 
quisite,” the first Mate hissed, His 
voice dripping venom. “As I said, 
my chief aim is my own amuse- 
ment And truly the finest pleas- 
ure lies in spying on you, who are 
the greatest Hunter of them all, 
slaying with love. And also the 
greatest prey, fleeing always 
from the simple truth.” 

“Silence!” the CaptAin Hissed, 
wrathful at last. “I’m sick of 
your sickness. Slither off at once 
to your study, and stay there. 
Place yourself under ships ar- 
rest” 

The First Mate obeyed with 
alacrity. As he glided into His 
hole, the Captain called after 
him, “And the great work goes 
on. I shall continue planting 
saviors!” 

The First Mate thrust back 
out of his Hole his flat black 
head with eyes like rounds of 
starry night. 

“Or simply the seeds of your 
great Death-oriented paranoia,” 
he hissed wth sheerest Hatred. 

“And you shall continue to 
watch me,” the Captain said, 
missing no least opportunity to 
stamp into the other the fact of 
his own unswerving strength. 

“So I shall,” thd First Mate 
hissed sharply. His head vanish- 
ed as if every atom of strength 
in his massive trunk had been 
employed to whip it out of sight.

Sweet Dreams, Melissa 


by STEPHEN GOLDIN 


It was a question of number . 


F rom out of Her special dark 
ness, Melissa Heard the voice 
of Dr. Paul speaking in KusHed 
tones at the far end of tHe room. 
“Dr. Paul,” she cried. “OH, Dr. 
Paul, please come Here!” Her 
.voice took on a desperate whine. 

Dr. Paul’s voice stopped, then 
muttered something. Melissa 
Heard His footsteps approacH Her. 
“Yes, Melissa wh'at is it?” He 
said in deep, patient tones. 

“I’m scared, Dr. Paul.” 
“More nightmares?” 

“Yes.” 

“You don’t Have to worry about 
them, Melissa. THey won’t Kurt 
you.” 

“But they’re scary,” Melissa 
insisted. “Make them stop. Make 
them go away like you always 
do.” 


Another voice was whispering 
out in the darkness. It sounded 
like Dr. Ed. Dr. Paul listened 
to the whispers, then said und er 
His breath, “No, Ed, we can’t let 
it go on like tins. We’re way 
behind schedule as it is.” Then 
aloud, “You’ll Have to get used 
to nightmares sometime, Melis- 
sa. Everybody Has them. I won’t 
always be Here to make them go 
away.” 

“OH, please don’t go.” 

“I’m not going yet, Melissa. 
Not yet. But if you don’t stop 
worrying about these nightmares, 
I might Have to. Tell me wKat 
they were about.” 

“Well, at first I thought they 
were the numbers, which are all 
right because the numbers don’t 
Have to do with people, they’re 


55 



nice and gentle and don’t hurt 
nobody like in the nightmares. 
Then the numbers started to 
change and became lines — two 
lines of people, and they were all 
runnings towards each other and 
shooting at each other. They were 
rifles and tanks and howitzers. 
And people were dying, too, Dr. 
Paul, lots of people. Five thou- 
sand, two hundred and eighty- 
three men died. And that wasn’t 
all, because down on the other 
side of the valley, there was more 
shooting. And I heard someone 
say that this was all right, be- 
cause as long as the casualties 
stayed below fifteen point seven 
percent during the first battles, 
the strategic position, which was 
the mountaintop, could be gain- 
ed. But fifteen point seven per- 
cent of the total forces would be 
nine thousand, six Hundred and 
two point seven seven eight nine 
one men dead or wounded. It 
was like I could see all those men 
lying there, dying.” 

CCT told you a five-year-old 
* mentality wasn’t mature 
enough yet for Military Logis- 
tics,” Dr. Ed whispered. 

Dr. Paul ignored him . “But 
that was in a war, Melissa. You 
have to expect that people will 
be killed in a war.” 

“Why, Dr. Paul?” 

“Because . because that’s 
the way war is, Melissa. And be- 


sides, it didn’t really happen. It 
was just a problem, like with’ the 
numbers, only there were people 
instead of numbers. It was all 
pretend.” 

“No it wasn’t, Dr. Paul,” cried 
Melissa. “It was all real. All 
those people were real. I even 
know their names. There was 
Abers, Joseph T. Pfc., Adelli, 
Alonzo Cpl., Aikens ...” 

“Stop it, Melissa,” Dr. Paul 
said, his voice rising much high- 
er than normal. 

"I’m sorry, Dr. Paul,” Melissa 
apologized. 

But Dr. Paul hadn’t heard Her; 
He was busy whispering to Dr. 
Ed. “ ... no other recourse than 
a full analyzation.” 

“But that could destroy the 
whole personality we’ve worked 
so hard to build up.” Dr. Ed 
didn’t even bother to whisper. 

“What else could we do?” Dr. 
Paul asked cynically. "These 
‘nightmares’ of Hera are driving 
us further and further behind 
schedule.” 

“We could try letting Melissa 
analyze herself.” 

“How?” 

“Watch.” His voice started 
taking on the sweet tones that 
Melissa had come to learn that 
people used with her, but not 
with each other. “How are you?” 
“I’m fine, Dr. Ed.” 

‘How would you like me to 
tell you a story?” 


56 


GALAXY 



“Is it a happy story, Dr. Ed?” 
“I don’t know yet, Melissa. Do 
you know wHat a computer is?” 
“Yes. It’s a counting machine.” 
“Well the simplest computers 
started out that way, Melissa, 
but they quickly grew more and 
more complicated until soon 
there were computers that could 
read, write, speak, and even 
think all by themselves, without 
help from men. 

“Now, once upon a time, 
there was a group of men who 
said that if a computer could 
think by itself, it was capable 
of developing a personality, so 
they undertook to build one that 
would act just like a real per- 
son. They called it the Multi- 
Logical Systems Analyzer, or 
MLSA. ...” 

ttnr'hat sounds like ‘Melissa,’” 
Melissa giggled. 

“Yes, it does, doesn’t it? Any- 
way, these men realized that a 
personality isn’t something that 
just pops out of the air full- 
grown; it has to be developed 
slowly. But, at the same time, 
they needed the computing abil- 
ity of the machine because it was 
the most expensive and com- 
plex computer ever made. So 
what they did was to divide the 
computer’s brain into two parts 
— one part would Handle nor- 
mal computations, while the oth- 
er part would develop into the 

SWEET DREAMS, MELISSA 


desired personality. Then, when 
the personality was built up suf- 
ficiently, the two parts would be 
united again. 

“At least, that’s the way they 
thought it would work. But it 
turned out that the basic design 
of the computer prevented a 
complete dichotomy; — that 
means splitting in half — of the 
functions. Whenever they would 
give a problem to the comput- 
ing part, some of it would neces- 
sarily seep into the personality 
part This was bad because, Me- 
lissa, the personality part didn’t 
know it was a computer; it 
thought it was a little girl like 
you. The data that seeped in 
confused it and frightened it. 
And as it became more frighten- 
ed and confused, its efficiency 
went down until it could no 
longer work properly." 

“WHat did the men do, Dr. 
Ed?” 

“I don’t know, Melissa. I was 
Hoping that you could Help me 
end the story.” 

“How? I don’t know anything 
about computers.” 

“Yes you do, Melissa, only you 
don’t remember it. I can Kelp 
you remember all about a lot 
of things. But it will be hard, 
Melissa, very Hard. All sorts of 
strange things will come into 
your head, and you’ll find your- 
self doing things you never knew 
you could do. Will you try it, 

57 



Melissa, to help us find out 
the end of the story?” 

"All right, Dr. Ed, if you want 
me to.” 

“Good girly Melissa.” 

Dr. Paul was whispering to 
His colleague. “Switch on ‘Partial 
Memory* and tell Her to call 
subprogram ‘Circuit Analysis.’ ” 
“Call ‘Circuit Analysis,’ Melis- 
sa.” 

All at once, strange things ap- 
peared in Her mind. Long strings 
of numbers that looked meaning- 
less, and yet somehow sKe knew 
that they did mean different 
things, like resistance, capaci- 
tance, inductance. And there 
were myriads of lines — straight, 
zig-zag, curlycue. And formu- 
lae ... 

“Read MLSA 5400, Melissa.” 

A nd suddenly, Melissa saw 
Herself. It was the most 
frightening thing she’d ever ex- 
perienced, more scary even than 
the Horrible nightmares. 

"Look at Section 4C-79A.” 
Melissa couldn’t help Herself. 
She Had to look. To the little 
girl, it didn’t look much differ- 
ent from the rest of Herself. But 
it was different, she knew. Very 
much different. In fact, it did 
not seem to be a natural part of 
Her at all, but rather like a brace 
used by cripples. 

Dr. Ed’s voice was tense. “An- 
alyze that section and report on 


optimum change for maximum 
reduction of data seepage.” 
Melissa tried her best to com- 
ply, but she couldn’t Something 
was missing, something she need- 
ed to know before she could do 
what Dr. Ed Had told her to. 
She wanted to cry. “I can’t Dr. 
Ed! I can’t, I can’t!” 

“I told you it wouldn’t work,” 
Dr. Paul said slowly. “We’ll 
have to switch on the full mem- 
ory for complete analysis.” 
“But she’s not ready,” Dr. Ed 
protested. “It could kill her.” 
"Maybe, Ed. But if it does 
. well, at least we’ll know How 
to do it better next time. Melis- 
sa!” 

“Yes, Dr. Paul?” 

“Brace yourself, Melissa. This 
is going to Hurt.” 

And, with' no more warning 
than that, the world hit Melissa. 
Numbers, endless streams of 
numbers — complex numbers, 
real numbers, integers, subscripts, 
exponents. And there were bat- 
tles, wars more horrible and 
bloody than the ones she’d 
dreamed, and casualty lists that 
were more than real to her be- 
cause she knew everything about 
every name — Height, weight, 
hair color, eye color, marital sta- 
tus, number of dependents . 
the list went on. And there were 
statistics — average pay for bus 
drivers in Ohio, number of 
deaths due to cancer in the U.S.

1965 to 1971, average yield of 
wheat per ton of fertilizer con- 
sumed. 

Melissa was drowning in a sea 
of data. 

“Help me, Dr. Ed, Dr. Paul. 
Help me!” she tried to scream. 
But she couldn’t make Herself 
Heard. Somebody else was talk- 
ing. Some stranger sKe didn’t 
even know was using Her voice 
and saying things about imped- 
ance factors and semiconductors. 

And Melissa was falling deep- 
er and deeper, pushed on by tHe 
relentlessly advancing army of 
information. 

Five minutes later, Dr. Edward 
Bloom opened the switch and 


separated the main memory from 
the personality section. “Melis- 
sa,” He said softly, "everything’s 
all riglit now. We know How the 
story’s going to end. THe scien- 
tists asked tHe computer to rede- 
sign itself, and it did. There won’t 
be any more nightmares, Melis- 
sa. Only sweet dreams from now 
on. Isn’t tfiat good news?” 
Silence. 

“Melissa?” His voice was high 
and shaky. “Can you Hear me, 
Melissa? Are you there?” 

But there was no longer any 
room in the ML5A 5403 for a 
little girl.

It was to be the greatest Train 
Robbery of all Space. Or maybe 
treason. Or just a horse trade. 


T he ad said: 

No Golfing 
No Fishing 
No Boating 
No Skiing 


It gave an address. Harry 
Wiseman glanced at it and toss- 
ed the paper across the room. 
Some Madison Avenue funny 
man was trying a switch on the 
old country-club appeal to en- 
gineers. Obviously, Ke expected 


Sweat and Guts Engineering Only it to bring in those who saw 


themselves as hairy-chested types, 
immune to the lures of soft sub- 
urban living. 

Harry's visitor picked up tfie 
paper and folded it neatly and 
laid it on the sofa beside Him. 

“I’m Hardly interested in a 
kook outfit like that,” said Harry. 

THe visitor raised His eyebrows 
in mild surprise. “We tfiougHt 
you might be,” He said, “consid- 
ering your past record and tfie 
fact that you Have been out of 
work for — let’s see — it’s almost 
six months, now, isn’t it?” He 
looked at the ceiling as if His 
careful mental calculations must 
not be disturbed. 

“WBo the devil are you?” Har- 
ry demanded. “CIA?” 

He could imagine no other 
outfit with the crust to demand 
He take a specified employment 
because they wanted Him to. He 
could think of nothing, either, 
that could have brought Him to 
their attention. That Vietnam 
deal — 

The visitor remained expres- 
sionless. 

“And what do you mean about 
my past record?” Harry said. 
“I’ve kept my nose clean.” 

"Sure. You’ve just moved it 
around too much. Like leaving 
your Vietnam assignment Half 
finished, for someone else to clean 
up.” 

“I Had been there almost eight- 
een months,” said Harry.

“Dropping a multi-million dol- 
lar operation in midstream — you 
cost the Government a lot of 
money.” 

“Not if they’d quit buying 
from outfits owned by Senators* 
brothers-in-law.” 

“TecKnical Contract Negotiator 
for the Air Force. GS-18. Not a 
bad salary with per diem and in- 
come tax rebate for foreign resi- 
dence. But you walked out. Said 
you wanted to get back to straight 
engineering.” 

C 4 T walked out because I flipped 
my lid,” said Harry. “My 
wife chose that precise time to sur- 
prise me witH a divorce suit and 
I got drunk for three months.” 
“In the divorce action your wife 
brought out the fact that you 
were notably unstable in your 
work activities. You moved so 
often you obtained a pretty wide- 
ly known reputation as a float- 
er.” 

“You’re saying it,” said Harry 
bitterly. “You seem to know all 
about me.” 

“So mucH so that we feel it 
rather urgent to insist you take 
this job opening which Smith In- 
dustries Has available.” 

“And if I don’t?” 

“If you don’t, I can promise 
that you’re not going to get an 
engineering job anywhere, not 
even as second assistant foreman 
in a button Hook factory.” 


GALAXY 



“So you are CIA,” said Harry. 
“Let’s say we are able to keep 
our promises.” 

An awful illumination burst 
upon Harry. “It’s you who have 
been keeping me out of work 
Since I got back!” 

The visitor shook his Head. 
"You just don’t walk out without 
notice from top-drawer engineer- 
ing jobs. Not unless you want a 
blackball tied permanently to 
your tail. And that’s what you 
Have got The word has gone out: 
Harry Wiseman is most unreli- 
able.” 

“How do you know this SmitH 
Industries will hire me — with 
a blackball tied to my tail?” 
“They’re looking for your type. 
Independents they want,” 

“Then I could get a job with 
them on my own. Your threats 
don’t mean anything!” 

“Not quite. We’d be forced to 
let them know it was undesirable 
to hire you under those cir- 
cumstances. They’d see it our 
way. Operating in foreign coun- 
tries as they do, it’s essential that 
Smith Industries have Govern- 
ment sanction.” x 

(C A 11 right,” said Harry wear- 
ily. “What do you want 
me to do?” 

“Apply for a job with Smith 
tomorrow. Then report to us reg- 
ularly on what you are doing, 
what kind of a job and what 

SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


kind of a firm you are witfi.’* 
“That’s all?” 

“That’s all.” 

“Why can’t you find out with- 
out all this flummery?” 

"Because Smith plays it close* 
We’ve tried to get a man into his 
shop before. He takes only top 
engineering talent and he knows 
it when he sees it. But we didn’t 
try very hard last time. Now it’s 
urgent that we find out.” 
“Why?” 

“Because they may get wiped 
off the map at any moment.” 
“And me with them?” 
“Possibly.” 

“Smith’s ad doesn’t build up’ 
the deal much, and you sure are 
not doing anything for it” 

The visitor ignored Harry’s 
comment "Smith operates in one 
of the New Nations of Africa. It’s 
a few thousand square miles right 
in the middle of the continent 
When it was a British Protector- 
ate, Smith obtained a mining 
concession, and He’s managed to 
hang onto it The local govern- 
ment of Gambua is made up of 
spear-throwing natives who still 
wear white men’s teeth as neck- 
laces, but Smith Has survived so 
far. THe New Nation next door 
is the Addabas, Hereditary foes 
of the Gambuans. But they don’t' 
throw spears any more. They’ve 
got Russian missiles on mobile 
launchers, and one of them is in 
place right now with' a bead on

Smith’s operation. We want to 
know what that operation is tie- 
fore tKe missile is fired.” 

“You said it was a mining 
concession.’’ 

“It is — as a cover for whatever 
Smitti is really doing. He Has 
nearly two Hundred people, and 
He Hasn’t sfiipped out any ore for 
ten yearn. Maybe tHe operation 
Is simply a dud. But maybe it's 
something we ought to know 
about, since tlie Communists are 
willing to expend a few million 
rubles worth of missiles on it.” 
“Do the Commies actually 
know wHat it Is?” 

THe visitor shook His Head. 
“We don’t know. They may be 
Only setting up another provoca- 
tion, a political probe. Or maybe 
sheer cussedness. Who knows? We 
want to find out.” 

“And I’m to walk into a tar- 
get area for Russian missiles that 
might be fired at any moment.” 
“There’s a nice bonus for you 
when you get back.” 

“7f I get back.” 

THe visitor shrugged. “That's 
the risk we all take. Maybe to- 
morrow’s sunrise will be a Rus- 
sian fireball. It’s the modern way 
of life.” 

“How do I know you’re on the 
level?” 

THe man arose. “Don’t force us 
to pressure you. It won’t do ei- 
ther of us any good. My name 
is Collins, by the way.”

T Tarry stayed motionless in His 

A cfiair as His visitor left, clos- 
ing tHe door quietly. Beyond the 
window, the lights of Manhattan 
were distant, cold, and unfriend- 
ly. Harry felt an exhaustion as if 
He had been running for a long 
time. As if He didn't Have enough 
troubles, why did one of the 
snoop agencies have to pick on 
him? 

It seemed as if it Had been like 
that ever since Marcia walked 
out. She Had turned out the light 
in his world when she left. He’d 
tried to cut every tie with engi- 
neering chores He’d once proudly 
called His career. Gadgets for the 
Great Society. He’d walked out 
without notice. And so the word 
Had been passed around: Harry 
Wiseman is not reliable. A Hun- 
dred personnel offices Had that in 
their files. And now He was vul- 
nerable to Collins and 12s kind. 

He turned on tfie table lamp 
and picked up tEe paper again. 
Smith Industries. No Golfing. No 
boating. No Etcetra. If it were 
on the level it might be some- 
thing he’d be interested in. He 
should Have seen it himself be- 
fore Collins walked in. Maybe he 
could have been in Africa by now, 
and Collins would still be looking 
for His sucker contact 

Who wanted to go to Africa? 
To a New Nation, where the na- 


GALAXY 



tives still wear white men’s teeth 
for necklaces? 

tT*he office was in one of the 
slick new buildings off Fifth 
Avenue. It had pastel carpeting, 
Danish furniture, and op art on 
the walls. There was no sign of 
either sweat or guts. 

A half dozen engineering types 
were ahead of him. Collins or no 
Collins, he could come back some 
other time without getting in that 
line of has-beens. 

The blonde at the desk stop- 
ped him. “It won’t be long, 
Mr. — ” 

“Wiseman. Harry Wiseman,” 
Harry said. “I’m too busy to 
wait. Is the head man ready to 
see me?” 

“If you’ll just fill out this ap- 
plication card, Mr. Smith can see 
you in a few minutes.” The 
blonde smiled persuasively. “It’s 
just a small card — ” 

“All right,” he said grudgingly. 
“If I can borrow a pen — ” 

It would have to be a guy 
named Smith. Couldn’t they be 
more original? But the blonde 
was right. After ten minutes of 
filling out the small yellow card 
Harry was alone. The other six 
types were gone, and Harry was 
invited into the office of Mr. 
Smith. 

Smith was a Civil Engineering 
type. His history was written on 
his weather-tough face. A dam or 


a pipeline foreman in his t won 
ties in some desert country. A 
project supervisor in his thirties. 
Vice-president and world-wide 
troubleshooter in his forties. Now 
in the home office in his fifties. 
But — interviewing recruits? It 
didn’t fit. 

Harry wondered how mucfi 
Collins’s interest in the company 
was justified. 

Smith looked at Harry’s appli- 
cation. “What’s your specialty?” 

“Microwave. Over-the-horizon 
radar,” said Harry. 

"Nice,” said Mr. Smith. “Very 
good.” He glanced up. "Mar- 
ried?” 

“Was,” said Harry. “No more.” 

“We like our people to be 
married,” said Mr. Smith with 
sudden fatherliness. “We provide 
the opportunity.” He turned 
away to a filing cabinet and ex- 
tracted a folder. He opened it and 
faced Harry again. 

“I’m afraid you have a rather 
unenviable job record,” he said. 

There it was again. The same 
tune Collins had played, Harry 
wondered if they worked together. 

“What do you mean, unenvia- 
ble?” he flared. “Guys with forty- 
grand houses and garden-club 
wives would give an eye far a 
job record like mine. I was at 
Thule when their BMEWS radar 
was burned in.” 

“And dismissed shortly there- 
after — ”

“The main work was done. No 
use Hanging around. Besides they 
were already getting Behind the 
state of the art and didn’t want 
good advice on How to update. 
I was in Korea as Systems En- 
gineer, troubleshooting the — but 
that system is still too classified 
to talk about.” 

K'VT’ou walked off that job,” 
-said Smith, “when it was 
half finished and left somebody 
else to clean up. You were mak- 
ing thirty grand a year and you 
walked off the job.” He shook His 
head. “And now in Vietnam, 
— How could you do a thing like 
that?” 

Harry looked at the floor, his 
face slack. “I Had problems. He 
looked up again, pulling his fa- 
cial muscles into position. “But 
they’re all solved now. Besides, 
how do you know so much about 
me? I’m supposed to be an- 
swering the questions.” 

Mr. Smith tapped the folder. 
“An arrangement with the local 
employment counselors — ■ I Have 
a dossier on most unemployed en- 
gineers in the locality. I like to 
be prepared when you come in.” 

“All right. So you’re going to 
tell me I’m a no-good boomer 
and your stable little organiza- 
tion can’t use a man who hasn’t 
seen eye to eye with all the dumb' 
supervisors He’s encountered in 
the last twenty years — and who 


happens to recognize that the av- 
erage engineering job can be fill- 
ed by a well-fed trained seal. 
Technical knowledge is doubling 
every 10 to 15 years? Trivia is 
doubling 1” 

“On the contrary,” said Mr. 
Smith mildly. “I like what I see. 
We’re what you might call a 
maverick organization ourselves 
— and we sort of run to maverick 
types in our personnel. Still, with 
your job record I don’t know 
where you could go unless you 
decide to team up with us.” 

“You mean you’ll take me 
on?” Harry Hated Himself for the 
eagerness He couldn’t keep out of 
his voice, Collins’s threats had 
nothing to do with it. 

“That depends,” said Mr. 
Smith. “That all depends. Shall 
we get down to business?” 

Business turned out to be a 
wringer that squeezed out every 
bit of data pertaining to Harry 
Wiseman’s existence, as if he were 
a computer tape dumped for to- 
tal readout. It lasted three days. 
Three days of EEG’s, IQ’s, dex- 
terity tests, aptitude, physical 
ability, and psychological endur- 
ance tests. He had supposed such 
things happened only to captured 
secret agents. When it was over, 
Mr. Smith knew more about Har- 
ry Wiseman than Harry Had ever 
known about Himself. And Har- 
ry knew a few things He wished 
he didn’t know.

T here was only one thing lack- 
ing, No one had told him 
what the job was. 

“You’ll learn as you go along,” 
Mr. Smith said kindly to a drain- 
ed exhausted Harry. “We operate 
according to good, on-the-job 
training principles.” 

Three days of probing, analyz- 
ing, and embarrassing inquiries 
had lowered Harry's threshold of 
tolerance. He felt suddenly en- 
raged. “I don’t think I’m inter- 
ested!" And if it hadn’t been for 
Collins he might have meant it. 

“You should know now that I 
understand you far better than 
you understand yourself. Go 
home and rest up. Come back to- 
morrow, and we’ll complete the 
details.” 

He left the building for the 
first time since entering three 
days ago. He left hating Smith’s 
guts. But he hated Collins more. 
There was no way out. 

In his apartment he closed 
the door and leaned against it, 
feeling still the fury of his resent- 
ment against Smith. It was grow- 
ing dark over the city, and he 
walked to the window without 
turning on any of the apartment 
lights. 

The trouble was Collins and 
Smith were both right. He could 
not get a job with a button hook 
company right now. Marcia had 
been right, too — before she 
walked out. Other engineers his 


age had given their wives forty- 
grand homes by now. Their kids 
had swimming pools and private 
LSD parties. But Harry Wiseman 
had always been the smart guy 
who was going to find the big 
one just over the horizon. 

Yet — could this be it? Three 
days ago he had been desperate 
for a job. Now, he had two — if 
Smith took him on. One job with 
Smith and one with Collins. He 
wondered if Collins would give 
him a decent burial if one of those 
Russian missiles was fired while 
he was there. Except there would 
not be anything to bury. 

He was fascinated by Smith', 
however. The operation smacked 
of crackpots. But no crackpots 
had devised the probing analysis 
to which he had been subjected. 
Smith radiated a fierce and ra- 
tional energy that had swept up 
Harry in his presence. Harry had 
to admit an attraction by the very 
force and power of the man. He 
knew he would have followed 
through even if Collins was not 
in the background. 

Of course, it was possible that 
what they were doing was strict- 
ly illegal. But he’d handled 
tougher customers. Up to now, 
however, he’d always had an idea 
what he was getting into. If he 
bought this, however, he’d be go- 
ing blind. 

Still, there was no choice. Not 
even a button hook company —

C/^ood morning,” said Smith. 
^ “You look as if you had 
good night’s sleep.” 

“From what you said last night, 
take it I’m hired.” 

“I thought ■ you understood 
hat.” 

“How much?” 

“We’ll start at twelve thou- 
sand. Maybe a little better as 
.irae goes on. Maybe not.” 

“I was doing better than twice 
hat” 

“Of course,” said Smith. He 
spread his hands in a deprecating 
gesture. “But you wouldn’t want 
:o go back for three times the 
amount. We’ll feed you and pro- 
vide your clothes and pay you 
the twelve thousand. What more 
do you want? Remote control de- 
vices for airplanes! Any two-bit 
engineer can do that. You want 
better things.” 

“All right. Where’s the job? 
And what is it?” 

It’s almost precisely in the 
center of Africa,” said Mr. Smith. 
"And, as I told you, you’ll find 
out what you are to do when you 
get there. Here are your tickets. 
You leave from Kennedy Airport 
at noon.” 

Ill 

l ie went from New York to 
Rome to Cape Town by 
commercial air liner. At Cape 
Town he boarded a private, ten- 


passenger jet with black and or- 
ange markings. Three fellow pas- 
sengers boarded with him. A 
young Chinese. An East Indian. 
And a man from South America 
named Roberto Roderiguez. Only 
Roderiguez spoke English. But he 
wouldn’t talk. He seemed appre- 
hensive. All of them did. 

The pilot accepted the cre- 
dentials supplied by Smith and 
said nothing. 

They flew straight north, past 
Tanganyika, over the depths of 
what was once called Darkest Af- 
rica and which was now a bevy 
of Emerging Nations. Harry 
knew that would make no differ- 
ence if the plane were forced 
down. The ship’s occupants might 
be crucified upside down and 
roasted over a slow fire. 

Where the hell were they go- 
ing, anyway? 

In the late afternoon a large 
clearing appeared off the star- 
board wing. The pilot banked the 
jet and began a long swing 
around the clearing, which Harry 
estimated was about two miles in 
diameter, roughly circular. The 
plane dipped toward a runway 
near the south edge, where a 
group of buildings crouched. The 
rest of the area was bare of vege- 
tation or artifact. Harry detected 
the line of a metal fence against 
the jungle. And, faintly, there 
seemed to be a pair of oblate 
hexagonal markings in the sand 


68 


GALAXY 



of the northern two thirds of the 
clearing. 

That was all. 

Harry saw a few people waiting 
as if to receive them at the small 
airstrip building. When the plane 
came to rest, there was a moment 
of complete silence. The passen- 
gers looked at one another. Then 
the pilot appeared and opened 
the door. 

“End of the line. Everybody 
out,” he called. 

Harry slowly followed the oth- 
ers down the short flight of steps 
to the ground. He stood a mo- 
ment by the plane, feeling the 
dense African heat press upon 
him. Dark green vegetation be- 
yond the clearing seemed like an 
impenetrable wall. The distant 
screams of animals pierced the 
air. 

The others were ahead now. 
He gripped his briefcase and fol- 
lowed. Twelve thousand a year 
for whatever Smith wanted done 
in this jungle hole I 

T?rom the shade of the broad 
^ overhang on the nearest build- 
ing a girl watched him, but he 
did not see Her until he had al- 
most readied the shadow. After 
the blinding sunlight, He could 
scarcely see anything. 

She extended a hand and said, 
“I’m Nancy Harris. You must be 
Mr. Wiseman. Welcome to Afri- 
ca Prime.” She wore a white 


dress that contrasted with Her 
sun-browned skin. He Had the im- 
pression she was young and very 
lovely. His eyesight, growing ac- 
customed to the shadow, confirm- 
ed the impression. He forgot to 
wonder what was happening to 
his fellow passengers. “I’ll show 
you to your quarters,” the girl 
said. “I hope you had a nice trip.” 
“Very nice,” said Harry. And 
he refrained from asking aloud, 
what in Heaven’s name a nice 
girl like her was doing here — in 
a steaming jungle targeted by 
Russian missiles. But then, she 
didn’t know about the missiles. 
Collin Had warned him not to tell 
them. Harry had agreed — he 
was agreeable to anything ten 
thousand miles away. 

Now, Smith Industries was not 
ten thousand miles away and to- 
tally impersonal. Smith Industries 
was the ground he walked on, it 
was the scattering of workmen he 
watched moving to and fro at a 
distance. 

Smith Industries was suddenly 
Nancy Harris. 

Africa Prime, she Had said. 

She watched his face as He 
looked over the compound. She 
smiled. “It’s not as serious as all 
that, Mr. Wiseman. We do have 
fun here. We really do,” 

He brought his eyes back to her 
and returned her smile. “Harry 
is the name,” he said. “And I’m 
sure you do have all kinds of fun 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS

here — but I’m just not used to 
being dropped into a fenced com- 
pound in the middle of Africa’s 
thickest jungle, and being escort- 
ed by a pretty girl guide.” 

“I’m a nurse,” Nancy Harris 
said. “We all function as guides 
and escorts when new employees 
come in. But that really doesn’t 
happen very often. When I learn- 
ed an American engineer was 
coming, I asked if I might meet 
him.” 

My pleasure,” said Harry. “I 
hope it’s not your disappoint- 
ment. Do you ever get away to 
see the outside world?” 

“I go every month to Cape 
Town, at least. I’ve been to Na- 
ples and Paris twice this year. We 
are not prisoners, you know.” 

“I really don’t know — for 
sure. I’m still waiting to find out 
why I’m here.” 

“Dr. Ames will explain that de- 
tail to you.” 

N ancy Harris led him through 
the building, which seemed 
to be nothing more than a passen- 
ger and air freight receiving cen- 
ter. On the other side was parked 
a Jeep with canvas top. Harry 
got in beside her. 

Nancy drove quickly a quarter 
mile down the narrow lane that 
paralleled the fence which held 
back the jungle. At the end she 
stopped beside a group of prefab 
buildings that were the quarters of 


the station’s personnel. “This is 
home,” Nancy said, with a flour- 
ish of her hand. 

It looked better than Harry 
had expected. 

“Your luggage will be brought 
up in a little while. I’ll show you 
your apartment, and you can re- 
lax until dinner. I’ll call for you 
then and show you our dining 
hall and other buildings. In the 
morning Dr. Ames will want to 
see you.” 

She left him at the door of 
his quarters. Harry entered and 
shut the door behind him. He 
flopped on the bed and gave way 
to the fatigue that had overshad- 
owed him on the flight from an- 
other time zone. He lay staring 
at the ceiling and wondering, 
what next? 

As soon as he could find out 
the nature of the work at the 
station he was prepared to mail 
a coded message to Collins, Mail 
was flown to Cape Town weekly 
on the orange and black jet. Af- 
ter that, he’d be ready to get out 
himself at the first opportunity. 
But what of the station person- 
nel? Would Collins warn Smith 
about the Russian missiles? 
Should Harry tell them — or 
would they by that time find out 
for themselves? And suppose the 
Addabas let their itchy fingers 
fire the missiles first? 

Harry found himself thinking 
of Nancy Harris and what to do 


70 


GALAXY 



about her. He didn’t want Nancy 
Harris incinerated in a Russian 
fireball. 

He speculated on the nature of 
the work going on here. He could 
not imagine anything that was of 
any consequence. It was probably 
some trivial activity that had no 
impact on the commerce or des- 
tiny of nations. Its only impor- 
tance was that the Addabas 
wanted to wipe it out, and Col- 
lins’ agency wanted to know what 
they were wiping out. The Rus- 
sian help was probably just a 
courtesy, payable in kind at some 
unknown future date. 

T Te fell asleep from exhaustion 
and aroused only in time to 
shave and shower and put on a 
change of clothes before Nancy 
showed up to escort him to din- 
ner. 

“Some of the families eat at 
their apartments, for the sake 
of privacy,” said Nancy. “But 
many of us. both families and 
single people, eat most of the 
time in the dining hall. It’s free, 
and wonderfully good.” 

Harry glanced at her specula- 
tively. “You are a single peo- 
ple?” he said. 

“For now,” said Nancy sober- 
ly. “I wasn’t always — but it 
didn’t work out. I came here a 
couple of years ago just after — 
it didn’t work out.” 

“There ought to be a pass- 


word,” said Harry. “I’m a mem- 
ber of the club, myself.” 

Harry agreed with Nancy 
about the food. It was the best 
meal he’d eaten in a long time. 
Nancy introduced him to numer- 
ous engineers and technicians, 
and to those wives who were 
present. 

They greeted him warmly, 
but there was a jolly cliquish- 
ness that failed to appeal 
to him. He had never been a 
joiner, and he didn’t appreciate 
the atmosphere of health groups 
and hobby clubs. 

He spoke of it to Nancy af- 
terwards. 

“They're not all like that,” 
she said. 

“There are even some real 
loners here. If that’s the kind 
you are, nobody’ll bother you. 
We’ve got room for all kinds — 
and, believe me, we’ve got all 
kinds!” 

“I’d like to meet some of 
them.” 

“You definitely will — in the 
morning.” 

He doubted his ability to sleep 
that night, but he was mistaken. 
Just before dropping off to sleep, 
however, he saw — or later im- 
agined he saw • — a faint blaze 
of blue, like some corona dis- 
charge, hovering over the distant 
black space of the compound. 
He slept, wondering what he had 
seen.

r y' , he station was managed by 
a Director. His name was 
Dr. Howard Ames, and he was 
never called Howard. He was 
the king of the loners, Nancy 
said. 

The phone rang before Harry 
was out of bed. It was Howard 
Ames’s secretary, and she said 
Dr. Ames would see Harry in 
fifteen minutes. 

He began an irritated protest 
and gave it up. “I’ll be there,” 
he said. A quick shave and a 
quicker shower left him six min- 
utes to dress and reach Ames’s 
office. Nancy had pointed it out 
to him the evening before, and 
he was counting on the Jeep, 
which she had said he could use, 
to get him there. 

He made it thirty seconds 
late. 

Howard Ames was a man in 
his late fifties, who looked as if 
he’d lived in the tropics all his 
life. He was standing at the win- 
dow of the dark-panelled office 
when his secretary ushered Har- 
ry in. He wore the same infor- 
mal garb of open-necked white 
shirt and cotton trousers that 
Harry had seen on most of the 
men he had met. On Ames, how- 
ever, it seemed like a uniform. 

His white hair was short and 
ruffled. The skin of his neck was 
sun-wrinkled. He turned slowly 


to view Harry as if he were some 
unfamiliar specimen. 

“I’m familiar with your file,” 
he said finally. “Is there any- 
thing else I need to know?” 

“I think Mr. Smith obtained 
all the pertinent data about me,” 
said Harry. 

“He usually does. You should 
know that you were hired more 
for personal characteristics than 
for your technical capabilities, 
although these are essential.” 
“Mr. Smith thought my per- 
sonal qualities were rather de- 
ficient.” 

“For some occupations. Not 
this.” Ames topped the desk. “It 
takes a certain kind of man — 
or woman — to support the oc- 
cupations here.” 

“And may I ask, finally, what 
that occupation is?” said Harry. 

“You may. But you won’t get 
the answer now. Some prelim- 
inary assignments will be requir- 
ed. Then we’ll determine what 
you need to know.” 

any held his temper. 

“First of all,” said Ames, 
“Mr. Smith' probably told you 
we exist in a somewhat hostile 
environment.” 

“He mentioned the Gambuans 
and the Addabas don’t get along.” 
“Unfortunately, we are right on 
the border. Forays from one side 
to the other are conducted con- 
stantly past our site. It is neces- 



72 


GALAXY 



tary to be prepared. All of us 
are well qu alifi ed in various areas 
of defense. You will report this 
morning to the rifle range." 

"I have a Sharpshooter's Med- 
al — ” 

"Good. But acquired in some 
former war, no doubt Still, per- 
haps you will need only a rela- 
tively brief refresher to maintain 
your skill. You will report to the 
practice range.” 

Harry felt his control slipping. 
"I didn’t come here as a mercen- 
ary guerilla. I was hired for en- 
gineering!” 

“You came Here for whatever 
purpose we wish to assign you. 
Let that be abundantly clear. 
We are not a military organiza- 
tion, but we maintain discipline. 
Orders are executed without de- 
bate.” 

His eyes challenged Harry to 
dispute his authority. Harry forc- 
ed down the tension of muscles 
that wanted to respond with a 
Hard left to that arrogant jaw. 
He had a feeling that those mus- 
cles would have their way before 
his stay at Africa Prime ended. 

“Of course,” he said quietly. 
“Is that all?” 

“If your marksmanship is as 
adequate as you think, you will 
be assigned to helicopter patrol 
as gunner and 1 observer. We find 
It necessary to mount a constant 
air patrol of the border for our 
own protection. The Gambuans 


reciprocate for the intelligence In- 
formation we are able to supply 
them?” 

Harry wondered if Ames Had 
any knowledge of the Russian 
missiles Collins Had mentioned. 
He debated mentioning them, and 
. decided against it. He’d like to 
spot them himself — if they ex- 
isted. There was no proof yet of 
Collins’ story. 

“I’ll do the best I can,” said 
Harry smugly. 

Ames’ glance Hardened at the 
time of Harry’s response. “If you 
do well,” he said evenly, “you 
will shortly be assigned to im- 
portant engineering duties. Report 
to the practice range. My secre- 
tary will instruct you.” 

T T arry was not surprised to find 
* his three companions of the 
flight from Cape Town also at 
the range. They appeared a little 
later, apparently having been in- 
terviewed by Ames after he was. 
They all knew how to Handle 
guns reasonably well, Harry ob- 
served. Most men of their age 
had had the experience some- 
where in the world. 

Harry was the best. 

The instructor was evidently an 
old drill sergeant from some army 
and some war. He grunted with 
reluctant satisfaction at Harry’s 
scores. He snapped orders as if 
he’d never left the service. But 
his grunts were unintelligible

when Harry tried to find out who 
he was and where he came from. 
Even his nationality was doubt- 
ful to Harry. He had the accent 
of a Belgian and the complexion 
of some Mediterranean national. 
He released Harry from further 
routine training and gave him a 
slip of paper. 

“Report for border patrol. 
Frank Declaux’s section. He eats 
smart boys for lunch.” 

“Some day,” Harry reflected, 
he was going to have to come 
back and take on this whole crew. 

That night he saw Nancy Har- 
ris again and told her of his ad- 
ventures of the day. She laughed 
at his grim description. “That’s 
just part of the preliminaries — 
a necessary one, however.” Her 
humor disappeared. “You’ll re- 
alize in time that this is one of 
the most important projects in 
the world, but it’s in terrible 
danger. This conflict between the 
Gambuans and the Addabas 
could overrun us at any time. 
We’re attempting to assure our 
own survival, but we’re not at all 
certain it’s enough.” 

“Tell me something about the 
project, Nancy. It’s all so myste- 
rious and hush-hush. Yet I get 
the feeling everybody knows all 
about it but me.” 

“Don’t ask me to tell you. I 
can’t. Dr. Ames will give you the 
information when he wants you 
to have it. And then you’ll see 


why he has to be so careful of 
new employees.” 

T~\eclaux was an Algerian. At 
least he boasted as much as 
he showed his contempt for Har- 
ry’s naive skills. 

“It’s an honor to be assigned 
with so experienced a flyer,” said 
Harry. “I’ll be way ahead with 
you showing me the ropes.” 

He was Harry’s man then. He 
smiled expensively. “You stick 
with Frank Declaux; you’ll know 
more than any ten men here 
about helicopter observation.” 
Equipment was newer and bet- 
ter than any Harry had seen in 
Vietnam. Direct-view infra-red 
cameras permitted constant scan- 
ning of the jungle, with picture 
taking as simple as snapping the 
shutter of an ancient Brownie. 

The jungle-covered trails cross- 
ing the border below them stood 
out on the screen like narrow high- 
ways. Motorized escorts were 
picked up a time or two on the 
Gambuan side. 

Harry eyed a distant Addaban 
valley. “Do you ever fly over 
those hills?” he asked. 

The pilot shook his head. “We 
have orders to stay on this side. 
Sometimes snipers shoot at us 
even then. They brought down 
one of our ’copters last week. 
Keep the camera down I” 

Harry had raised the mirror 
viewer to scan briefly the distant 


74 


GALAXY 



hills and valley. But nothing 
could be seen across the ridges. 

“How do you know there aren’t 
mortars or guns across those 
hills?” said Harry. “How do you 
know the Addabas haven’t got 
something even bigger?” 

“Like what?” said Declaux. 

“Like missiles, maybe.” 

The pilot scoffed. “Those dumb 
natives don’t have anything like 
that!” 

“Little' missiles. Mortars, at 
least." 

Declaux looked worriedly. 
“Mortars they could have. Who 
knows where they’d get them? 
But they could have mortars, all 
right Almost anybody can get 
mortars nowadays.” 

“We ought to know,” said 
Harry. 

Declaux agreed silently. “But 
we have orders not to cross the 
border,” he said. 

week later they crossed. 
Harry played upon the pi- 
lot’s desire to excel, until at last 
Frank Declaux recognized wliat 
a coup it would be to be the first 
to detect the presence of enemy 
heavy armament. If it existed. 

They flew north, crossing the 
Invisible boundary in the mat of 
Jungle below. “But if they start 
shooting, we go back — quick!” 
laid Frank Declaux. He looked 
Over the side in uneasy anticipa- 
tion of a crash landing. 


“Those hills to the left,” said 
Harry. “Twenty degrees. If there’s 
anything to be found I think it 
will be over there.” 

He pressed his face to the cam- 
era viewer, watching the ghostlike 
spectacle of the jungle. Its bones 
stood revealed in stark fluores- 
cent glow, the trails and road- 
ways etched out of the growth 
in twisting lines. He spotted a 
camp site ahead and steered De- 
claux away from it. A tiny burst 
of light off to the left revealed 
a sniper’s pot shots. He steered 
away from that area, too. 

If missile launchers were actu- 
ally hidden in the jungle, how- 
ever, the enemy would probably 
depend on camouflage and jun- 
gle cover to keep the position hid- 
den, rather than reveal it now 
with anti-aircraft fire. 

But he had to agree with De- 
claux. If they ran into any heavy 
fire they’d have to retreat — if 
they were able! 

For more than half an hour he 
guided the pilot in a zig-zag 
sweep of the approach to the val- 
ley beyond the low ridge of hills. 
Once or twice again, sniper fire 
burst harmlessly below them, and 
they swung away. Then they were 
over the ridge and looking into 
the valley. Harry swept the cam- 
era back and forth. The jungle 
here was even heavier than 
around the compound of Africa 
Prime. The image on the IR 



SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


75 



screen was almost featureless. 

Then he saw it. A faint glow of 
angular lines, distorted and melt- 
ing into one another. 

“Northeast, sixty-five degrees,” 
He said td Declaux. “Take it easy. 
If they’re going to clobber us, 
it will be here.” 

He Had no intention of flying 
directly over the hidden mobile 
launcher. And it wasn’t necessary. 
In another two minutes the tele- 
scopic sight of the IR viewer Had 
picked up a sufficiently discerni- 
ble outline of the same kind Har- 
ry had seen a hundred times in 
Vietnam. 

He turned the film feed and 
snapped the shutter a dozen 
times. 

Included in the view was an 
anti-craft battery that Had them 
dead targeted. 

“Let’s get the Hell out of Here,” 
said Harry. 

It was his last observation 
flight. 

D r. Ames called for him to op- 
pear the next morning. An- 
other man was with the Director 
when Harry entered the office. 

“Mr. Wiseman,” said Dr. 
Ames, “I want you to meet Steve 
Martin. This is Harry Wiseman, 
the engineer I mentioned to you, 
Steve. Harry Has just finished a 
stint of observation patrol with 
Declaux.” 

Harry shook Hands with the 


stranger. Steve Martin was quiet, 
hard, and purposeful. He had an 
air of knowing something that 
was better not known. 

“Mr. Martin is Operations 
Manager,” said Ames. “He takes 
care of everything from ordering 
thumbtacks to — Well, Steve will 
show you. I’m putting you di- 
rectly under his wing. He doesn’t 
have the time for many of our 
newcomers. But lie saw your rec- 
ord and asked if He might take 
over your indoctrination.” 

Harry glanced at the expres- 
sionless face of the Operations 
Manager. He wondered what 
Steve Martin had seen in His rec- 
ord that moved him to such a re- 
quest. 

“Mr. Smith recommended Mr. 
Wiseman very highly,” said Ames. 

“We’ll see,” said Steve Martin, 
finally. He turned. “If that’s all, 
Dr. Ames, we’ve got an urgent 
module exchange to handle this 
morning.” 

“That’s all,” said Ames. “I’ll 
see you again in a few days,” he 
said to Harry. 

The largest building in the 
compound, and the one closest to 
the bare, sandy plain which com- 
prised most of the area Had been 
identified to Harry as the Oper- 
ation Center. Harry had been 
warned away from it, but now he 
rode toward it with' Steve Martin. 

The building was a square, white 
block that reminded Harry of a 


76 


GALAXY 



Federal Reserve Bank, weirdly 
misplaced from a middle-size 
American town to the African 
jungle. A guard house stood be- 
side a fenced entrance like that of 
some secret defense plant. Steve 
Martin parked the jeep beside a 
row of a dozen others. Harry slip- 
ped on the special badge Martin 
had given him. 

The guard waved them through' 
Without delay. 

•’■ph'e building seemed utterly si- 
lent. Harry glimpsed the great 
central section which was filled 
with banks of equipment that 
looked like computing, recording, 
indicating, and control panels. A 
eouple of operators broke the long 
emptiness of the aisles. 

Steve Martin led the way 
quickly to an elevator opening off 
the corridor. Inside, he punched 
a 10 button. But the elevator did 
not rise. It dropped swiftly, and 
Harry watched the indicator. Ten 
levels. A hundred feet or more be- 
neath the surface. He speculated 
on the magnitude of engineering 
and construction responsible for 
this place. 

At the tenth level the door 
opened silently and Harry follow- 
ed Steve Martin into the gallery 
that spread out before them. The 
aisle was forty feet wide, banked 
On either side with massive panels 
twelve feet high. The brightly lit 
ceiling was another five or six 


feet above the panels. And tfie 
gallery stretched for what seemed 
an immense distance straight 
ahead. Harry estimated it was 
several hundred feet long. 

“This is what we call the Main 
Helix Section,” said Steve. “None 
of that will mean anything to you 
now. Later you’ll learn something 
about the functions here. I 
brought you along just to give 
you the feel of the place and show 
you something of our activities. 
We maintain this equipment 
mainly by replacement of mod- 
ules. One went out of commission 
last night, and we’re in the pro- 
cess of replacement now. Here 
comes the new one.” 

From their left, almost silently, 
a ponderous black module slid 
forward. 

Harry noticed then that 
small tracks were buried in the 
floor, and the great mass was roll- 
ing on a low dolly whose wheels 
followed the tracks. A silent mo- 
tor drove the dolly. It was con- 
trolled by crewmen who walked 
beside it. 

That mass seemed to Harry like 
a chunk of polished black marble. 
A dozen feet high’, it was twenty 
feet wide and thirty deep. 

“We don’t have to replace one 
of these very often, but when we 
do it’s a major operation. Let’s 
go down to the receptacle. You 
can give us a hand with the recon- 
nections.” 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


77 



'T'hey mounted a small person- 

■* nel car and drove a quarter 
of a mile down the gallery to the 
space that gaped like an empty 
tooth socket with ten thousand 
hanging nerves and blood vessels 
waiting to be reconnected. 

The module that had been re- 
moved was waiting on its dolly 
beyond the cavity. 

“I’m going to assign you to the 
concentric connector crew. That’s 
our most difficult operation, but 
you should be able to make your- 
self useful with your BMEWS 
experience. Here’s the foreman, 
Howard Maxon. He’ll give you 
a little instruction while the mod- 
ule is moving up.” 

Harry shook hands with the 
foreman, a ruddy-faced craftsman 
whose whole life was his skill in 
fitting metal objects together in 
pleasing and satisfying patterns. 

Howard took him over to one 
of the massive connectors. It 
looked like a giant collapsible 
cup with thirty or forty concen- 
tric rings pushed back from one 
another. The whole conductor was 
nearly four feet in diameter. The 
foreman explained how the rings 
Had to be fitted one by one onto 
a mating connector on the mod- 
ule so that they were concentric 
within five ten-thousands of an 
inch. 

“It really isn’t as bad as it 
looks. Steve likes to make out 
like it’s a real tough job, but all 

78 


it takes is a little skill. You’ll 
see.” 

Harry felt he’d see that he was 
nothing but in the way. He could 
not possibly be of any help on 
such an unfamiliar precision job. 
And as he obtained glimpses of 
other portions of the work, he got 
the feeling that the connection of 
the concentric conductor was the 
simplest operation of all. 

For one thing, the massive 
block itself had to be placed with 
a precision of three thousandths 
of an inch. Howard said it weigh- 
ed a hundred and twenty-five 
tons. 

“What’s in it?” said Harry. 

“That what we’d all give ten 
years of our lives to know,” said 
Howard. 

E ighteen hours later the module 
was in place, and the crew 
was on the edge of exhausted col- 
lapse. The twenty-five-man crew 
had worked with only moments 
for breaks. There was a fierce 
dedication in their work that 
Harry just could not understand. 
Any technical crew he had ever 
known would have demanded 
double time for loss of lunch 
breaks, and double that after 
twelve hours. This crew worked 
as if it were the personal respon- 
sibility of each man to get the 
job done — and his life almost 
depended on it. 

Harry mentioned it to Steve. 

GALAXY 




“Yeah, these guys take their 
work seriously,” said the Opera- 
tions Manager. “All we have to 
do now is deliver the defective 
module and we’re through.” 

“Deliver it: where?” said Harry. 

“The repair shop,” said Steve. 

At a mile an hour, the great 
block moved down the gallery 
and turned the comer in the di- 
rection from which Harry had 
seen the first module appear. 
He followed beside Steve Mar- 
tin and a half dozen other crew 
members who remained to attend 
the final operation. 

The dolly moved past anoth- 
er section of smaller control pan- 
els of unknown purpose and de- 
ceptive simplicity. Harry sensed 
an immense complexity here that 
was beyond his understanding. 

Beyond, a vertical door raised 
to permit the passage of the mod- 
ule. A vault that must have been 
fifty feet in height opened be- 
yond. A hemispherical wall sealed 
it at one end. The other opened 
to the endless depths of a vast 
tube that seemed to disappear in- 
to some vague and eternal night. 

The module moved out to the 
center of the cavern, and the 
door was lowered. Harry saw now 
that it was at least ten feet thick, 
but when it was closed there was 
a semi-transparency that formed 
a window in the great, movable 
wall. 

Steve Martin stepped to the 


controls, inspected a number of 
meters and satisfied himself with' 
their readings. Then, in quick 
succession, he pressed a numbci 
of controls. 

A gradual blaze of golden light 
built up in the window of tho 
great door. There was no out- 
ward sign, yet Harry felt as if 
the very space in the room wai 
slowly being twisted by crushing 
forces. It hurt in some depths of 
his being that he had never been 
aware of. 

The golden light burst into bril- 
liance like that of an exploding 
sun. There was no sound. Just 
the great flame. And then the 
twisting was gone. 

The other crewmen saluted 
Steve and moved off. “That does 
it,” one of them said. 

Qteve Martin nodded. He re- 
^ mained unmoving by the pan- 
el. He pressed a button, and the 
thick door moved up. Beyond, the 
cavern was empty. “Now you 
know,” said Steve. 

Harry squinted into the empti- 
ness and looked back at Steve, 
“Know what?” he said. “What 
am I supposed to know? I saw a 
big black box disintegrate in 
flames. A hundred and twenty- 
five tons of big black box — ” 

Steve shook his head. “No. 
Think now. Did you see anything 
disintegrate? Do you see any 
ash?” 


80 


GALAXY 



“Then what did I see? Where 
is the module?” 

“Alpha Centauri.” 

“Alpha — ” 

“That’s what we say among 
ourselves. Actually, we don’t 
know where it went. It’s just out 
there somewhere.” 

Harry shook his head, bewil- 
dered. “I don’t understand what 
you’re trying to tell me.” 

"This is a railroad station 1” 
Steve Martin spread his arms 
wildly, as if the tension of the 
past hours was being released in 
• sort of idiocy. “You and I and 
Dr. Ames and sweet Nancy Har- 
ris and all that gang you saw here 
today — we’re railroaders. We 
run trains I” 

Harry backed off before Steve’s 
Idiotic outburst. Then the Opera- 
tions Manager laughed. “I’m not 
off my rocker. I’m telling you the 
truth. We operate a rail line. The 
Alpha Centauri line — freight, 
passengers, chickens, dogs — 
what have you.” 

He slapped the bewildered Har- 
ry on the shoulder in the gesture 
of a tavern drunk. “See Ames 
In the morning. He’ll give you the 
whole story. Tell him I said you 
pass okay. I didn’t tell you, did 
I — you did a real nice job to- 
day. You’re going to fit in with 
the boys real well. Come on — 
I’m tired. Let’s get the hell out 
of here.” 

Without giving Harry a chance 


to reply, he led the way back to 
the elevator and out of the build- 
ing. On the way back to the bar- 
racks he was quiet and stolid and 
said nothing. Harry remained si- 
lent, trying to understand the sig- 
nificance — if any — of what 
he had heard. 

In the night, before he went 
to sleep, he looked out over the 
compound. The blue glow weaved 
and swirled like an aurora. 

VI 

TV. Ames’s secretary called 
A-/ again before Harry had fin- 
ished shaving. Ames wanted to 
see him right away. 

He was pacing slowly between 
his desk and the broad window 
overlooking the bare expanse of 
the compound. He nodded and 
kept up his paring as Harry ap- 
proached. 

“Martin says you did very 
well,” Dr. Ames said, “There’s no 
reason why you can’t become a 
first-class maintenance engineer.” 

Harry remained standing, star- 
ing at the moving figure of the 
scientist. 

“Sit down,” said Ames. “Steve 
told me he gave you a somewhat 
incoherent hint of our work here.” 

“He said something about rail- 
roading. It didn’t make much 
sense. He said something about 
Alpha Centauri, too.” 

Ames sat on the other side of 

81 


$UBWAY TO THE STARS 



the desk and leaned across it. 
“Does that make any more 
sense?" 

“I doubt it.” 

“It could — couldn’t it?” 

“You tell me,” said Harry. 

“Nearly sixty years ago,” Ames 
said reminiscently, “my father 
was a physicist with the Bureau 
of Standards. It was long before 
the days of flying saucers and 
such, but in any age there are 
wonderful lights and mysterious 
presences. My father was ap- 
proached by one such. 

“It wasn’t merely wonderful 
and mysterious. It was an Emis- 
sary from another planet of an- 
other galaxy. He wasn’t here on 
conquest or trying to collect 
specimens or any other weird or 
stupid thing. He simply wanted to 
set up a transportation station 
and asked if my father would be 
willing to get some people togeth- 
er and help them. 

“I needn’t go into what it took 
for my father to convince some 
of his fellow scientists that he 
wasn’t on opium — the LSD of 
his generation. He succeeded. The 
Emissary helped him succeed by 
presenting himself to the group 
and explaining his wishes in very 
plain English. 

“Once they were convinced, the 
group fell over themselves in 
their anxiety to be of service to 
this representative of an incred- 
ible culture that was beyond any 


dreams of their day. They had 
visions of traveling to the worlds 
spoken of by the Emissary. But 
he quickly squelched any such 
ideas. He said he couldn’t allow 
that. He just needed some help 
in setting up and maintaining the 
station, and would they give it. 

They leaped to the opportunity. 
They devoted the rest of their 
lives to it. And this is it. 

“The people represented by the 
Emissary set up the station pret- 
ty much as you see it now. It was 
on the site of a mining conces- 
sion, a dummy structure to cam- 
ouflage the real operation. And 
our people settled down to oper- 
ate the station.” 

ttTJrrt what is it?” Harry ex- 
^ claimed. “What kind of 
transportation is this? What do 
you have to do?” 

“We would call it a matter 
transmitter,” said Ames. “Matter 
is converted to energy forms far 
outside any spectrum with which 
we are familiar and literally 
transported through space — be- 
tween far distant galaxies. Wc 
aren’t sure where it originates or 
where it terminates.” 

“Don’t you ever see what’j 
transported?” 

“This is a relay station,” said 
Ames. “Much like a communica- 
tions repeater station. It receives 
the transmitted energy from 
somewhere else a hundred or a 


82 


GALAXY 



thousand light-years beyond. We 
have never been told where.” 
“What is your function?” 
“Actually, we have few duties. 
We don’t understand how the 
process or the equipment works, 
of course. And it is either self- 
programmed or functionally con- 
trolled by signals from central 
control stations. We do have im- 
portant duties in replacing failed 
modules, as you saw today. We 
also, of course, provide general 
protective and custodial service 
for the station.” 

“Such as running off the Adda- 
bas when they get too close.” 
Ames nodded. “That — among 
other things.” 

“It’s in a poor location.” 

“But one that can’t be moved. 
When it was first established this 
was the most remote comer of 
the Earth.” 

Harry settled heavily into his 
chair. It was hard to believe 
Ames’ bewildering story, but he 
had no reason not to believe it. 

“Consider the implications,” Dr. 
Ames said. “They have a federa- 
tion of hundreds, maybe thou- 
sands of races that live in har- 
mony with one another. They 
have a technology that’s light- 
years ahead of us. We’ve got to 
have a piece of that. We’ve got to 
make them let us into the club!” 
Harry shook his head. “It 
doesn’t make sense that they 
would come to us for assistance 


in running their railroad. They 
wouldn’t need us if what you say 
is true. They’d either set up an 
automatic station or they’d put 
in some of their own people. They 
would have a station somewhere 
in space rather than needing a 
planet to put it on.” 

“You don’t understand. This 
isn’t of great importance to them. 
It’s just a little branch-line rail- 
road running out into the sticks. 
The main center of their civiliza- 
tion is so far away you can’t com- 
prehend it. This is just a rural 
milk run to them. And for the 
most part, their station is auto- 
matic. We don’t know how it 
works. We don’t know how to run 
it or repair it. All we know is what 
they’ve taught us: to make a few 
mechanical adjustments and re- 
place modules when indications of 
trouble appear.” 

tfr^hey could still get along 
without you. It doesn’t 
make sense.” 

“Yes, they could. But they’d 
have to put in a lot more auto- 
matic equipment. This little 
branch line isn’t worth it. They 
can hire the local natives to do a. 
little footwork and save a big 
expense. As far as reliability goes, 
the equipment is foolproof. If 
there are indications of malfunc- 
tion that we can’t handle, they 
just shut it down.” 

“Has that ever happened?”

“No. The station has never 
broken down that far.” 

“So you sweep the floor of the 
station and empty the ash trays 
for these alien characters. What 
do you get out of it?” 

Dr. Ames had been facing the 
window. Now he turned in aston- 
ishment to face Harry. “What do 
do we get out of it? Can you im- 
agine what it’s like to be in con- 
tact with a super-civilization 
whose science is so far ahead of 
ours it makes us feel like chil- 
dren learning to crawl? Their 
need to have a transporter sta- 
tion in this galaxy provides us 
this one tenuous thread of con- 
tact. 

“Fortunately we were the most 
adaptable to their needs. We 
have an association with a sci- 
ence so far beyond ours that 
we cannot comprehend the mag- 
nitude of this great unknown.” 
“Yes, but what do they pay 
you for these services?” Harry 
insisted. 

“Pay? There is no pay as such I 
Who could estimate the worth' of 
this association? They supply us 
enough to maintain ourselves in 
good circumstances. What more 
could we ask?” 

“They give you subsistence. 
But do they teach you this great 
science of theirs? Have you ob- 
tained knowledge and products 
that are commercially useful?” 
“Commercial!” 


“Yes, commercial. It’s a funda- 
mental law of nature, you know. 
Cells operate that way on the 
basis of I’ll do this for you and 
you do that for me. When such 
associations become a one-way 
street, the organism dies. You try 
to operate that way, and you’re 
already part of something that 
is dead.” 

“Your analogy is hardly per- 
tinent.” 

“Well, then, how about some- 
thing socially useful? Have they 
given you anything you’d call 
socially useful to the human 
race?” 

Dr. Ames’s eyes brightened 
“That is the great Hope that 
keeps us going! So far we’ve ob- 
tained only nibbles through our 
own deductions about what is 
around us here. We know the time 
will come, however, if we show 
the human race is worthy, that 
the Emissary’s people will teach 
us and lift us into a sphere that 
will make the present condition 
of man seem like that of prehisto- 
ric cave-dwellers.” 

“Someday out of the goodness 
of their hearts they’re going to 
invite the ignorant natives to 
join their exclusive brain club,” 
Harry said disdainfully. 

“It’s the best hope the human 
race has ever had! Could you — 
now that you know what this 
represents — turn your back on it 
and forget it?”

T Tarry made an unpleasant, 
snorting noise. “I think you 
have been had. These characters 
come along with, a sob story and 
wangle services worth millions of 
dollars in exchange for peanuts. 
You sweep cigar butts and empty 
spittoons in their little railroad 
station. And they must be laugh- 
ing like hell at such a bargain. 
Or else they think they’ve conned 
some simple minded natives into 
minding the store for the glory 
of association with the Great 
Feathered God. You have non- 
profit transactions only with 
groups too primitive to deal, to 
value, to negotiate. It’s always 
been an insult to give a man 
something. He’ll slap you in the 
face for it the first time he gets 
on his feet. It’s a sign of primi- 
tiveness not to ask for a deal.” 
Dr. Ames stared at him coldly. 
But there was pain in his voice 
when he spoke. “I’m sorry you 
see the situation from such a 
viewpoint. Mr. Smith’s report — 
which is obviously erroneous — 
indicated a high degree of ideal- 
ism that is not apparent in you. 
We thought you would be de- 
lighted at this opportunity to par- 
ticipate in the intelligent growth 
of the Universe.” 

Harry swore. “Look, I’m as 
idealistic as the next guy, and I 
could see how nice it would be 
to have a slice of the science that 
can build matter transmitters. 


But if you can’t get your hands 
on it, you may as well have never 
heard of it. It’s not doing you 
any good. What does growth of 
the Universe mean if you’re not 
part of it?” 

“When the human race is wor- 
thy — ” 

“Nuts! The human race will 
never be worthy. And who sets 
the standards of worth, anyhow? 
A few people within the human 
race could undoubtedly make 
good use of this science and may- 
be elevate the race as a whole be- 
cause of it. But it’s no good un- 
less it’s in your hands. And you 
have given these creatures two 
generations of service — !” 

“Our service has been very 
small,” said Ames, “for the priv- 
ilege of association with such an 
advanced culture.” 

tC'VT’ou’ve been caught in a 
bare-faced con game. They 
sound like some of the contrac- 
tors I’ve seen who propose to 
build world-beating weapons 
systems for the Government, and 
when you look into it you find 
they’re working out of a barn. 
When I was a Technical Con- 
tract Negotiator I learned that 
people respect a man who asks 
a fair price for what he does. No- 
body respects the outfit that tries 
to buy in on a program by offer- 
ing a i job below cost These

by intelligent natives in this part 
of the galaxy. Obviously, there 
aren’t any others within fifty 
thousand light-years. We’re them ! 
And there you had the Emissary’s 
crowd over a ■barrel and didn’t 
even try to dicker a fair deal out 
of them. 

“Sometimes it’s better to say 
‘Right deal or no deal at all.’ It’s 
not true that a deal at any cost 
is right. Every deal has a price 
that’s too high for the benefit 
received. A seller will always try 
to force the buyer above that 
point. A little old-fashioned horse 
trading can make a deal profita- 
ble for both sides. If it can’t, the 
deal is not worth consumating. 
Everybody knows that except, 
some scientists and U.S. foreign 
policy experts. You’re being play- 
ed for suckers.” 

“It may be necessary to extend 
your probationary period,” said 
Dr. Ames. “You can guess that 
we occasionally find potential em- 
ployees who do not fit into our 
program. Hypno- chemical meth- 
ods must be used to prevent their 
revelation of our program after 
we expose it. I’m sure Mr. Smith 
explained this to you.” 

"Mr. Smith didn’t explain any- 
thing. But it really doesn’t mat- 
ter much. You’re done for, any- 
way. This very unworthy human 
race — or some members thereof 
— are about to blow the entire 
operation off the map.” 


“What exactly do you mean?” 
“I mean this little hotbed of a 
border war going on around you. 
You aren’t dealing merely with 
spear-throwing natives. The oth- 
er side has Russian missiles, and 
they’re zeroed in on this station 
right now.” 

VII 

T'Vr. Ames seemed to shrink as 
-®— ' he sank into his chair. His 
face green lined and gray. His eyes 
seemed to retreat in their sockets 
as he stared at Harry. "How do 
you know?” he said at last. 

“They showed up on the IR 
camera during helicopter patrol. 
I saw enough of them in Vietnam 
to recognize them.” 

“I haven’t seen any such pic- 
tures.” 

“I don’t know what happened 
to the pictures. Maybe some- 
body’s hiding them from you. But 
I took them, and you should be 
able to recognize the mobile 
launchers yourself.” 

Dr. Ames nodded slowly. His 
eyes focussed over Harry’s shoul- 
der and an infinity beyond. “I 
see,” he said slowly. “I see. You 
have done us a great service, 
Wiseman. Now I wonder if I 
could prevail upon you to assist 
in our final function?” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“You spoke the truth a moment 
ago when you said things didn’t 


86 


GALAXY 



matter now. They don’t. This is 
the end of two lifetimes of dream- 
ing. Whatever you think of the 
rationality of our actions, you 
must agree we’ve been faithful 
to our dream. Now we must per- 
form one final act of faith.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

‘‘If one of those missiles is fired 
and destroys the station the Train 
will also be destroyed. You see, 
we’re not talking about a discrete 
thing, made up of cars, an en- 
gine and so on. The ‘Train’ is 
more a pipeline. It is in continu- 
ous operation and is filled with 
merchandise, raw materials — and 
inhabitants of a thousand worlds. 
If the station is destroyed, it will 
mean the destruction of an ines- 
timable volume of goods and 
the deaths of hundreds of crea- 
tures of the galaxy. We must not 
let that happen.” 

“How can you prevent it?” 

“We can institute a procedure 
known as shunting. It has never 
been used by us, but it has been 
established by the operators as an 
emergency procedure that will 
shunt the train to another track, 
so to speak, and enable it to reach 
an emergency station. But once 
we use it, they will never rein- 
state Earth as a relay point.” 
“Why? This is a legitimate 
emergency.” 

A mes smiled bitterly. “I’m 
afraid they don’t like our 


brand of emergencies. During the 
two World Wars they closed the 
station and threatened to move it 
completely. We assured them 
such things could not happen 
again and that the station would 
be safe. Now the station is in 
more danger than it has ever 
been, and we have tried to keep 
the information from them for 
fear they would move it. I’m 
afraid we haven’t been wise. We 
have been greedy. Now, shunting 
is our only choice.” 

“What do you want me to do?” 

“A shunting procedure would 
be opposed by many of our peo- 
ple. They are fiercely determined 
to maintain the station at all 
costs. But they forget the cost 
would be paid by our friends of 
other galaxies, rather than our- 
selves. So I might be opposed 
and overpowered if it were known 
I was going to shunt. I will get a 
dozen technicians I can trust. I 
can use your help. Will you join 
me?” 

Harry felt caught now in forces 
he understood not at all. But he 
felt a kinship with Ames and his 
dreams. Regretfully, he wished 
the decision did not have to be 
so final. But with the missile 
zeroed on the station there was no 
time to defend or negotiate. The 
risk was too great. The Train had 
to be put out of danger. 

“I’ll do anything I can,” he 
said. 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


87 



“Good. It will take a little time 
to make preparations. Meet me in 
the Operations Center an hour 
from now. Don’t be late. It will be 
dangerous to delay any longer.” 

Harry left the office with a feel- 
ing of some ‘’infinite sadness. It 
was all too new for him to fully 
comprehend or sense the feeling 
among the station personnel. But 
now he could understand some- 
thing of the intense devotion that 
had seemed so mysterious before. 

In front of the Administration 
Building he met a junior techni- 
cian who was just alighting from 
a Jeep, “Mr. Martin wants to see 
you right away. It’s very urgent,” 
the technician said. “He sent me 
to look for you.” 

The technician gestured toward 
the Operations Center and wait- 
ed expectantly for Harry to climb 
into the Jeep. Harry waited delib- 
erately. The technician seemed 
too anxious. Yet this couldn’t 
possibly have anything to do with 
Harry’s conversation with’ Ames. 
He wanted to help Ames now. 
Nothing must hold him back from 
that 

“Can’t it wait until later?” lie 
said. “I have some appointments 
to keep.” 

“It won’t take long. Mr. Mar- 
tin is very anxious.” 

T TTith the same slow delibera- 
’ » tion Harry got into the 
Jeep beside the technician. A 

88 


few moments later He was in 
Steve Martin’s office in the Op- 
erations Center. 

Two other men were present. 
Harry had not met either. 

“Sit down,” said Steve. He ges- 
tured to a chair. His face was 
hard and unfriendly. 

Harry sat on the edge of a desk. 
Steve watched, challenging Har- 
ry to decline his invitation. Harry 
remained where he was. 

“Who are you?” Steve said. 

“You know who I am.” 

“No, we don’t. I’ve seen your 
pictures of the Addabas missile 
launcher. You knew it was there. 
Frank Declaux says you led the 
way right to it. You knew where 
to look. Who are you, Wiseman? 
What are you doing here? How 
did you know about that launch- 
er?” 

“I saw plenty of them in Viet- 
nam,” said Harry. “They’re easy 
to recognize once you’ve seen 
one.” 

“That’s not good enough. You 
led Frank Declaux right to it. 
You knew where to look.” 

“I’ve seen enough' gun sites and 
missile pads to know where they 
are supposed to be.” 

“Right where you knew it 
would be.” 

“So you’re telling the story,” 
said Harry. “What’s the next 
chapter?” 

“I don’t know.” Steve dropped 
in a chair and put his feet up 


GALAXY 



on the desk and watched Harry’s 
face with minute inspection. 
“Smith couldn’t have been that 
wrong about you. His tests are 
better than that.” 

“They’re pretty thorough,” 
Harry agreed. 

“Look, Wiseman. I’m going to 
give you the whole story now. 
And your life depends on what 
you decide to do about it. There’s 
no place to run to from Here, 
and nobody to call for help. Is 
that clear?” 

“Quite clear.” 

“All right. You’ve heard Ames’s 
side of the story. Now Hear ours. 
Two generations of good men 
have been wasted waiting for the 
Emissary and hi9 people to give 
us something more than a grub- 
stake for taking care of their sta- 
tion. They’ve given us nothing. 
We’ve made the best possible 
psychological analysis of the 
Emissary. Dr. James Here — ” 
Steve nodded to one of the other 
men. “ — Dr. James is among 
the world’s best qualified psy- 
chologists in the field of antago- 
nistic cultures. His analysis is that 
the Emissary is never going to 
give us anything. They’re playing 
us for patsies.” 

( ( T told Ames exactly that,” 
said Harry. “We seem to be 
in full agreement” 

“Good. That makes the rest of 
it much easier.” 


“And what’s the rest of it?” 
“We’re going to take something 
in return for the years of service 
EartHmen have given the Emis- 
sary.” Steve pointed out to the 
the barren compound. “Out there, 
every hour there passes knowl- 
edge and wealth of artifacts of a 
super-science belond valuation. 
We’re going to stop the train and 
help ourselves. For fifty years 
we’ve been doing janitor work for 
these creeps. They’re never going 
to invite us into the club. But 
one trainload — just one train- 
load would repay us for every- 
thing. It would advance our basic 
science by a dozen generations. 
We’d get enough to reach out to 
the stars and make contact with 
the galaxies on our own.” 

“I’ll be damned,” said Harry. 
“A regular old-fashioned train 
robbery!” 

“Call it that if you like. We 
prefer to view it simply as a long 
overdue collection.” 

“And you want me in?” said 
Harry. “How come? What do 
I do?” 

“You keep your mouth shut. 
That’s absolutely all. Just keep 
your mouth shut. It’s on that that 
your survival depends. The stakes 
are too high for us to be fooling 
around.” 

“I’m afraid you lost me on that 
round. What am I supposed to 
keep shut about?” 

“The missile launcher.” 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


89 



“Now you have lost me. What’s 
the connection between the mis- 
sile and your proposed high-jack- 
ing of the train?” 

“The missile is the means. It’s 
zeroed on the north grid, the 
transmission grid. When that grid 
is blown out of commission the 
Train will automatically mate- 
rialize on the reception grid, the 
south one. It will pop up right 
here in the compound with its 
load of goodies.” 

“It seems to me it would be a 
lot easier to just pull a switch 
somewhere.” 

Steve laughed. “It might — if 
we could find a switch to pull. 
You saw the modules we deal 
with. We honestly don’t know 
how to disable any selected part 
of the station. We’ve been looking 
for five years.” 

“Your proposal is a little on 
the risky side. Even Russian mis- 
siles aren’t that accurate.” 

“We’ve zeroed this one in with 
accuracy we consider sufficient.” 
“And suppose it works? Do you 
think the Emissary is going to 
hold still for that? How do you 
know those people won’t be down 
here with fire and wipe the whole 
Earth out of the Universe?” 

( C nr'he probability is better 
than 99% that they won’t 
react. We show them this is the 
product of intra-group dispute. 
They’re used to our wars. They 


will pull their station out as they 
threatened to do the last time, 
but they won’t retaliate. Dr. 
James is sure of it.” 

“I wish I was as sure as Dr. 
James is,” said Harry. “No of- 
fense — ” he nodded to the psy- 
chologist. 

“Of course not,” said Dr. 
James. “We are adequately cer- 
tain of our ground. Our explana- 
tion of a missile blast will be ac- 
cepted. Sabotage of the equip- 
ment — even if we could do it — 
would be recognized as deliberate. 
That could cause retaliation.” 
“So you’re Communists,” said 
Harry with finality. 

“No,” said Steve, “that’s one 
thing we aren’t. They think we 
are. We’re using them. They’ve 
used us long enough. Don’t you 
think it’s time for a turn around?” 
“It’s a case of supping with the 
Devil.” 

“We can handle them. Don’t 
worry about that” 

“The famous last words of a 
lot of good men.” 

“Forget it. You’ve got the pic- 
ture of the situation. Where do 
you stand?” 

“On the sidelines — if you 
don’t mind. I think you’re a 
bunch of damned fools,” 

“That’s all right with us. But 
just keep your mouth shut about 
the missile. Is that clear?” 
“Clear. I’m just curious about 
one point. What would Dr. Ames 


90 


GALAXY 



and his people do if they learned 
about it?” 

“Ames is an old fool. His whole 
< rowd is a btinch of old women, 
ihinking they’re going to get 
mmething out of the Emissary. 
Hut if you told them about this 
iliey would start an operation 
I'nlled shunt. It would turn the 
train aside, and we’d be out of 
luck forever — and you would 
I* as dead as it’s possible to get.” 

Harry started to move from the 
llble. The door burst open with 
flldden fury, and the same tech- 
nician who’d escorted him here 
utmost fell into the room. He was 
wanting heavily and white-faced. 
'Dr. Ames — ” he gasped. “Dr. 
Ames has been looking at the 
batch of IR pictures Mr. Wise- 
man took. He’s seen the missile 
and launcher.” 

Steve stood up. He and James 
looked at each other. “It’s got to 
be now,” said James. “We can’t 
risk a delay.” 

Steve nodded faintly in agree- 
ment. They moved to the door. 
Then he turned back to Harry. 
“You’re remembering real hard.” 

Harry nodded. “I’m remember- 
ing real hard?” 

VII 

IT arry glanced at the clock. Dr. 

Ames would be in the Opera- 
tions Center by now. Harry didn’t 
know what Steve might do to the 


Director if they met at this mo- 
ment. But if they didn’t meet, 
Steve would be off to whatever 
rendezvous he had to keep to or- 
der the firing of the missile. And 
Ames had to be helped — 

But if the missile were off 
course — Harry swore to himself. 
The damned, damned fools! 

Ames must be out there by 
now, but he stopped by the phone 
and dialed a number. 

“Nancy? Harry. I’m at the Op- 
erations Center. Can you drop 
whatever you’re doing and come 
right over? There’s something 
important — ” 

She begged off, and Harry in- 
sisted, as much as he dared with 
their somewhat fragile relation- 
ship. At last she agreed in a puz- 
zled voice. 

“Right now!” said Harry. “I’ll 
be waiting.” 

It would be the safest place. 
He could send her down to one of 
the lower levels on some pretext. 
But he had to find Ames now. 

The Director was at the central 
control panel with six engineers. 
Harry was acquainted with two 
of them, Kripps and Sanderson. 

“We thought you weren’t com- 
ing,” Ames said. “We’ve got to 
hurry. Take panel Two and fol- 
low Ed’s commands exactly. He 
will give you the sequence of steps 
when we reach that point.” 

Harry nodded. The controls 
were complex and unfamiliar. He 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


91 



didn’t see how he was going to 
follow any kind of critical se- 
quence the first time through. The 
engineer Ed began filling him in 
quickly/ explaining what was to 
be done. 

Before he was well started, the 
voice of Dr. Ames called out the 
beginning of the control sequence 
in strong, defiant tones. “Jam!” 
A sequence of controls was op- 
erated by the engineers. Harry 
followed their glances as they 
watched the indicators. Some of 
these consisted of small poles 
with changing hues of colors. 
Others were little balls that 
moved through a tell-tale maze in 
response to the commands of the 
controllers. 

After minutes, Ames called out 
the second command. “Trade!” 
His eyes followed anxiously the 
movements of his engineers as 
they wiped out his dream and 
the dream of his father and all 
those who had spent their lives 
on the station. 

“Switch!” 

“Float!” 

|^~\ne by one, the obscure signals 
^ were called. Ames’s face glis- 
tened with a sheet of sweat as he 
watched the responses of his crew. 
Then his hand reached for a 
control — it was halfway there. 
His lips were shaped to give the 
command. The engineers Held 
their readiness for the next step. 


The actions were never finish- 
ed. Sudden light flamed over the 
station. It flowed into every cor- 
ner of the control room and 
burned eyes that shut in sudden 
agony against it. 

Then shock. It hurled the sci- 
entists to the floor. Walls shat- 
tered, and wild cries of pain told 
of those pinned beneath the de- 
bris. 

And sound. It roared and 
blasted and tore. Its dying away 
was a huge vacuum into which 
the senses fell. 

Harry groped helplessly from 
his prone position. His mouth was 
filled with dust and blood. The 
scene was lit by flames from the 
grid area. 

“Dr. Ames — Nancy — 1” he 
called out. 

“They struck the grid,” Dr. 
Ames cried in anguish. “They hit 
the grid before we completed the 
shunt.” 

Harry struggled to his knees 
and crawled toward the scientist. 
“Dr. Ames — are you all right?” 

“All right,” Ames gasped. He 
twisted painfully to a sitting po- 
sition. “Look to the others. We 
have got to get out of here. And 
the Train — it will materialize on 
the receiving grid!” 

But Harry was thinking of 
Nancy Harris, whom he’d so stu- 
pidly asked to come to Opera- 
tions to be safe in case of attack. 
He limped back toward the en- 


92 


GALAXY 



trance while Ames called out to 
him in dismay. “Wiseman — the 
grid!’* 

He found her by the door. She 
had just entered when the blast 
came and had been thrown to 
the floor. She stirred dazedly now 
and looked up at him. "Harry — 
Harry — what’s happened?” 

He reached down and lifted her 
gently. “The Addabas blasted the 
grid. Control is knocked out. The 
Train is materializing.” 

[ “Oh, no — J Oh’, no, Harry — ” 
the cried a moment in his arms. 
J She had shared the dream of 
Ames and the others. It didn’t 
matter now that it was a phony 
dream, Harry thought It had 
been Nancy’s dream, too. 

N ow the roaring rose and be- 
came like that of a tKou- 
»and jets far beyond the hori- 
zon. It approached and increased 
at the speed of jets, but did not 
pass. From the center of the 
South Grid the sound crashed 
against the jungle, the station 
buildings, and the people who 
staggered and groaned against it 
In terror and amazement. 

Harry pushed through’ the 
sound as if it were a physical 
barrier, supporting Nancy with 
an arm about her waist. Dr. 
Ames and Kripps and Sanderson 
got to their feet and moved to 
the empty windows overlooking 
the Grid. 


There was mass out there, a 
strange mountain of mass that 
grew as they watched. As if from 
some internal heat, it glowed. 
Through blood-red, crimson, to 
white brilliance even in the Afri- 
can noon-day sun, the light rose 
and flamed. The mass moved as 
if in pain, and out of the midst 
of it came new alien sounds like 
the cries of beings from another 
world. 

“Materializing — ” Ames 

groaned. 

“But it’s out of synch!” Kripps 
exclaimed. “It’s a conglomerate 
mass!” 

"Freight — goods — people 
from dozens of alien worlds.” 
Nancy murmured. “Like a crash- 
ed ship. Dr. Ames, we’ve got to 
Help them!” 

Ames seemed dazed by the dis- 
aster. “Yes — yes,” he agreed. 
“We’ve got to help them. Please 
notify the medical staff, Nancy. 
Tell them I order them here at 
once to do what they can.” 

“Our own people need help, 
too,” said Harry. The cries of in- 
jured continued to come from 
other parts of the building. He 
turned back to the room. Some 
figures lay still upon the floor 
in concerted shapes. Others were 
standing, like himself, gazing 
numbly at the desolation. 

Nancy tried the phone and 
found it dead. “I’ll get Dr. Bintz 
and Dr. Walker,” she said. “I’ll 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


93 



go back to the barracks and get 
everyone to bring supplies and 
help.” 

“You’re sure you’re all right?” 
said Harry. 

“I’m fine.” 

“Kripps — Sanderson!” Harry 
called. “Check our people in the 
building, will you? Find out who 
needs help. The medics will be 
here in a few minutes.” 

The engineers nodded in dazed 
agreement. Harry moved toward 
the window where he’d last seen 
Ames, but the scientist was no 
longer there. 

Harry called his name. Kripps 
said, “I think Dr. Ames went 
down towards the Grid.” 

H arry saw him then. The proud 
figure was shambling pain- 
fully toward the mountain of 
rubble that was growing a half 
mile away. Harry crawled over 
the debris of the fallen wall and 
raced toward him. The roar of 
crashing materials was a physical 
force. A gale wind of displaced air 
speared at him. Amid the mael- 
strom, a quieter sound of seething, 
hissing substances was like a 
counterpoint. 

“Dr. Ames! You can’t go out 
there! It’s too dangerous.” 

Ames turned, his face reflecting 
his inner agony. “There are peo- 
ple out there. People of other gal- 
axies. They’re alive in that burn- 
ing mound. We’ve got to help!” 


“There’s nothing you can do, 
We’ll get a fire truck and the 
medics and do anything that’i 
possible, but it’s too dangeroui 
for you to get near the pile whilo 
it’s growing.” 

“If they aren’t crushed in that 
mountain of junk, our alien at- 
mosphere will kill them.” 

Ames paused, and Harry stood 
by him, and for the first time 
absorbed the magnitude of the ca- 
tastrophe. The inferno of mate- 
rializing objects was growing as 
if, literally, a cosmic train were 
piling into an immovable obsta- 
cle. There were flames rising from 
scattered points on the mound, 
but the crimson glow was caused 
more by the release of radiant en- 
ergy as the flowing beam recon- 
verted to tangible atoms. 

The walls seemed almost verti- 
cal, as if the mass were growing 
from within. Like a moving lava 
front, the upper edges curled and 
toppled and were borne under the 
slowly expanding wall. 

“We always wondered what 
would happen — ” said Ames al- 
most inaudibly. “Some of us 
thought the Train would materi- 
alize in good order. But others 
thought that synchronization 
would be lost and only a con- 
glomerate mass would appear. 
They were the ones who were 
right.” 

Harry wondered if Ames had 
any idea that Steve Martin was 


94 


GALAXY 




responsible for the disaster. Sure- 
ly he must have suspected what 
Steve was thinking. 

A nd then they saw him. The 
desperate figure of the Oper- 
ations Manager was leaping from 
a Jeep and racing toward the 
mound from the direction of the 
barracks buildings. He seemed to 
have no intention of stopping. 
His ant-like figure was almost at 
the base of the expanding mound. 

“Martin!” Harry shouted vain- 
ly through the chaos. 

Steve Martin was at the very 
edge of the mound, retreating as 
it spilled toward him. Harry surg- 
ed through the blast of air and 
heat and sound. The expanding 
wall of debris was nearly vertical 
as he reached Steve Martin. The 
top curled outward and fell with 
avalanche fury, 

“Martin!” Harry grasped the 
Manager’s arm and pulled him 
back from the edge of the in- 
ferno. 

Steve Martin fought loose, ob- 
livious to danger as the mass 
tumbled at his feet. 

“Come back, Martin!” Harry 
shouted. “That stuff will bury 
you!” 

“No, it’s all right. We’re safe 
here. Look, Wiseman — we miss- 
ed getting what we wanted be- 
cause synchronization didn’t hold. 
But you can make out the shapes 
of stuff, and it’s still good. We 


can still find out what it’s madr 
of and how it works. Look, now 

— what is that? Household goods 

— machinery — scientific equip- 
ment? From where? This stuff 
has come from Andromeda Al- 
pha Centauri — worlds a hun- 
dred million light-years away. 
This is what they’ve been holding 
back — the Emissary and his 
chiseling crowd. They thought 
they could use us like some for-j 
eign (natives. And Ames, old! 
mother Ames — he thought by 1 
being nice to the Emissary they 
would turn loose some of this' 
stuff in time. When the human 
race is worthy, he used to say. 
Did he give you that line, Wise- 
man? 

“If we knew the sciences, the 
technologies behind this stuff — 
even this scrap — But we’ll find 
it, Wiseman. And you’ll help us, 
won’t you? You’re remembering 
real good, aren’t you, Wiseman? 
Remembering real good — ” 

“Look out!” 

Harry glanced up at the mass 
that burned and curled outward 
above them. He gripped Steve 
Martin’s arm and dragged fierce- 
ly- 

Martin tore loose from his 
grasp and moved even closer to 
the moving, surging mound, as if 
to embrace it wildly. Then the 
curling mass plunged down. 
Harry heard faintly the cry of 
pain and terror. 


96

D r. Ames limped painfully to 
Harry’s side. “I saw it. Tliat 
was an awful way to go, but a 
man like Martin doesn’t deserve 
mucti better.” 

"You knew?” 

Ames nodded. “I knew lie 
wanted to materialize the Train. 
I didn’t think he’d go this far. 
but when I saw your pictures of 
the missile launcher, I knew there 
was no time left We had no other 
course but to abandon the pro- 
ject.” 

Harry looked back at the surg- 
ing, growing mass that seethed 
and hissed and represented the 
science and technology of worlds 
more fabulous than all man’s 
dreams. “There could have been a 
better way,” he said. “It didn’t 
have to end like this. We coul c j 
have made a deal with them. You 
can always make a deal with any- 
body if you just try hard enough 
— if they’ve got something you 
want, and you’ve got something 
they want. All it takes is a little 
decent horse trading ■ — ” 

A movement far down at the 
edge of the pile caught Harry’s 
eye. Dr. Ames saw it, too, and he 
gasped as he saw a figure — a 
creature — and then another.” 
Ames gripped Harry’s arm. 
“Harry — people. Passengers 
from the Train — they’re still 
alive!” 


A grotesque shape struggled up 
from the ground, groping with 
two arms. In despair, it tumbled 
on its side, shuddered and lay 
still. It was a furry, unfamiliar 
shape, but Harry could see it was 
burned and tom with lethal in- 
juries. 

Beyond it, another alien, a bip- 
ed, struggled up, staggered and 
took a step forward. It had giant 
eyes, like a lemur’s, that shone 
even in the sunlight. Short, fluffy 
hair covered its body — a bar- 
rel-like torso with pipestem limbs. 

Ames sucked in his breath. 
“The Emissary! But it can’t be 
— it’s one of the same race. 
They’re air breathers. They can 
survive in our atmosphere. Most 
of these others can’t.” 

The creature stumbled, then 
steadied itself. Finally it bent 
down and picked something from 
the ground. 

"A child!” Ames exclaimed. 
“One of their children.” 

“On its way to grandmother’s 
house on the other side of the 
galaxy,” murmured Harry. He 
felt it was silly, but it could well 
be true. 

As they watched, Nancy drove 
up in a Jeep and saw what was 
taking place. She jumped out and 
ran to them. 

“We’ve just got to help 
those people!” The fiery wind 
buffeted her as she raced toward 
the two creatures. 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS

Qhe approached the alien and 
k -' held out her arms for the in- 
fant. The adult whirled and 
slashed out with one arm. The 
blow struck Nancy on the side 
of the head .and knocked her to 
the ground.* 

Harry and Dr. Ames rushed to 
ward off further attack. 

“Don’t!” cried Nancy. “It 
didn’t understand. It thought I 
meant harm to the baby. They 
must be half crazy with shock, 
anyway.” 

They faced the alien in a mo- 
ment of doubtful hostility. Then, 
slowly the alien slumped. The 
spidery arms grew lax, and the 
huge eyes softened with infinite 
imploring. 

“Catch the baby!” Nancy 
cried. 

Harry stepped forward and 
caught the young one as the adult 
collapsed. Words of a sibilant, un- 
comprehended tongue slipped 
from the furry lips, and then the 
strange body was still. 

“I’ll take the infant to the dis- 
pensary,” said Nancy. “We’ve got 
to help as many as we can.” 

“We don’t understand their 
metabolism or their anatomy,” 
said Dr. Ames. “We couldn’t even 
safely apply an antiseptic to their 
wounds — or give an anesthetic 
for an operation we wouldn’t 
know how to perform. There’s al- 
most nothing we can do for 
them.” 


“We’ve really got to try.” 
“What about our own people?” 
said Harry. 

“Everything is under control. 
The doctors are at the Operations 
Center now. They have plenty to 
help. But six of our own people 
are dead.” 

Dr. Ames looked at the spot 
where Steve Martin had disap- 
peared. “Seven,” he said. “But 
maybe you’re right. | We shouldn’t 
count him as one of our people.” 
Nancy laid the small furry 
alien in the back of the Jeep and 
drove to the dispensary in the 
barracks area. Harry and Dr. 
Ames walked back to the Opera 
tions Center. It was swarming 
now with station personnel under 
the direction of the doctors. 
Stretcher patients were being 
ferried to the dispensary for treat- 
ment of wounds and operations 
on internal injuries. 

“The end of a dream,” said 
Dr. Ames. “Maybe you were 
right, Wiseman. We were idiots 
to dream. Man is an idiot to 
dream in a world where dreams 
can’t come true.” 

“I didn’t say that,” said Harry. 
“There’s nothing wrong with 
dreaming. You just have to go 
about it in the right way.” 

"If I weren’t too old to learn I 
might ask you to show me the 
right way.” 

And who am I to tell anyone 
how to dream? Harry thought. 


98 


GALAX! 


When all of my own have turned 
so sour — 

r T~*he pile of debris continued 
-*• growing through the day. By 
nightfall it diminished its rate of 
growth slightly, but continued to 
glow and roar and stir fierce 
winds. Dr. Ames said that the 
transmission had undoubtedly 
stopped long ago, but whatever 
was in the pipeline would have to 
feed on through to its own de- 
struction. 

They knew that some salvage 
of a thousand priceless technolo- 
gies might be possible from the 
debris, but they gave little 
thought to that now. 

During the afternoon, living 
conditions were restored as best 
they could. The dead were buried 
and an airlift of the injured to 
Cape Town was begun. 

They bore the aliens to the 
expanded, makeshift quarters in 
the barracks buildings, gave them 
such medical care as seemed fea- 
sible while they took care of their 
own injured. 

Harry looked for Nancy near 
the end of the day and found her 
at the bedside of the alien child. 

“I’ve been able to talk with her 
n little,” said Nancy. “She speaks 
the language of the Emissary, 
which we’ve all learned a little. 
She’s about the age of a ten-year- 
old among us. She was on the way 
across the Galaxy to visit others 

SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


of her family. It was the first trip 
she had ever been allowed to take 
alone. The one who picked her 
up was an older woman with 
whom she’d made an acquain- 
tance just before the trip. She’s 
like a little girl on the way to 
visit her grandmother in the coun- 
try!” 

So it hadn’t been so silly, after 
all. 

Harry looked at the little lemur 
face. The huge eyes seemed to 
plead for succor he could not give. 
“Do you have any idea how to 
treat her? Do you know what she 
eats?” 

Nancy shook her head. “We’ve 
read something in their books 
about their native foods, but we 
can’t compare them with ours. 
We’ve taken blood and tissue 
specimens for analysis to see if 
we can estimate food require- 
ments. We know, of course, 
they’re on a carbon-oxygen cycle 
so we ought to be able to come 
close.” 

X 

/^Vn the morning after the disas- 
ter, they saw what Harry had 
been told everyone expected to 
see. 

The Emissary. 

His ship was like an eight-foot 
crystal egg. It appeared after sun- 
rise between the South Grid and 
the ravaged Operations Center. 


99 



All station personnel who were 
able to walk were waiting and 
watching for him. And dreading 
the sight when he came. 

The Emissary emerged from Ins 
ship and walked toward the ruin. 
The station ‘fire truck was still 
pouring foam onto the outbreaks 
of fire. The Emissary watch'ed 
it, and the personnel of Africa 
Prime watched him. The silence 
was total. Only the squeals of 
jungle animals beyond the com- 
pound and the hiss of foam on 
the mountain of debris were 
heard. 

Dr. Ames walked slowly from 
the crowd toward the Emissary. 
He passed the crystal egg, and 
then the Emissary turned' and saw 
him. They stood a moment The 
crowd could not Hear their words. 
Harry guessed Dr. Ames was tell- 
ing how the accident Happened: 
An act of war by the enemies of 
the Gambuans. 

TKe alien and the scientist be- 
gan walking back. They stopped 
in front of the crowd. Dr. Ames 
began speaking slowly. 

“I Have expressed our deep re- 
gret to our friend, the Emissary, 
that our condition of warfare Has 
finally resulted in such a tre- 
mendous disaster to their trans- 
portation system. I am told that 
there can be no consideration of 
the continuation of the relay sta- 
tion, even though I Have suggest- 
ed relocation to other, more re- 

100 


mote areas such as the poles or 
the Australian outback. They 
have made a comprehensive com- 
puter-type prognostication of the 
political and martial future of 
Earth’s civilizations, and it is not 
favorable to their continuing 
operation here. There is no other 
answer except to end the associ- 
ation. The Emissary would like 
to express his regrets and his 
thanks to you.” 

I n halting bursts of gutturally- 
spoken English, the Emissary 
began to speak. At first, Harry 
could not distinguish the words, 
but gradually he was able to get 
the intent of the alien’s words. 

“It is with regret that I end 
our establishment,” the Emissary 
said. “You have served faithfully 
and long, but our establishment 
is not safe. Our merchandise has 
been destroyed and the lives of 
our people have been lost — and 
we shall Have to account to the 
Dm war and the Ectoba Galaxies 
for the loss of their travelers, and 
it will not be a pleasant negoti- 
ation. This must end. We give you 
our many thanks for your serv- 
ices. But this must end.” 

He seemed to glance over the 
crowd without seeing and then 
turned. Disbelief and uncompre- 
hending disappointment were on 
the faces of the engineering anti 
technical personnel of Africa 
Prime. But nobody spoke. 

GALAXY 



None except Harry Wiseman. 
He plunged out of the crowd 
and stopped within a half dozen 
feet of the Emissary. 

“Just a minute, please. I think 
you’re forgetting something.” 

The Alien turned at the strange 
sound of Harry’s voice, scanned 
him with the lemur eyes and fi- 
nally spoke disparagingly. “Noth- 
ing has been forgotten.” 

“Payment,” said Harry. “You 
forgot to say anything about pay- 
ment for the services rendered to 
date.” 

The eyes scanned him again. 
“You have not been here before. 
I would have remembered you.” 
“I’m new, all right. I’ve been 
appointed Technical Contracts 
Negotiator. That’s my business. 
Sometimes a contractor and a 
customer don’t see eye to eye on 
the cost of a program, and it’s my 
business to iron out any discre- 
pancies.” 

“You talk gibberish,” said the 
Emissary. “I don’t understand a 
thing you are saying.” 

“I’m saying you owe these peo- 
ple payment for their services. 
They have done something for 
you, now you must do something 
for them.” 

The Emissary turned and faced 
Harry squarely. “You excite my 
interest. They made no request 
for any kind of payment — ex- 
cept to come to our planet, which 
we could not permit because of 


restrictions on lower cultures. It 
disturbed us at first. We could 
not understand why you made 
no request in return. We conclud- 
ed your culture was just too pri- 
mitive. I estimated we were ador- 
ed, and we gave small things like 
gold bobs.” 

“You misestimated completely, 
I’m afraid,” said Harry. “Those 
gold bobs were used to buy goods 
to sustain these people, but it was 
strictly subsistence. A payment in 
term of profit is desired. Do you 
understand me?” 

“Yes — I think I do,” the 
Emissary said. “And you astonish 
me. I did not know this was so 
high a culture.” 

T Tarry felt a burst of elation. 

He’d been right in his sizing 
up of the situation. The scientists 
had been taken for boobs because 
they had acted like boobs, Harry 
smiled expansively and hooked 
his thumbs in his belt. 

“Well, now — so you recog- 
nize that we haven’t had a very 
good deal. So you’ll see how we 
just couldn’t take another con- 
tract like this one. We’ve lost our 
shirts, and I know you wouldn’t 
want to see that happen again — ’’ 
“This must end,” the Emissary 
said with discernible frost in his 
voice. “We have agreed to that.” 
Harry ignored his interruption. 
‘We haven’t had a very good 
deal. But we might be persuaded 


SUBWAY TO THE STARS 


101 



co continue if some arrangement 
for back remuneration could be 
made. In turn, we would be 
agreeable to establishing fully se- 
cure facilities.” 

“There is no place on your planet 
that is secure. *We would not risk 
establishing our station again un- 
der such conditions as prevail 
here.” 

Harry nodded in sad agreement. 
“We are more than aware of our 
own grave deficiencies. We feel 
deeply our own negligence in ex- 
posing your station to the hazards 
we did. But we also recognize 
your great need of a terminal in 
this area. That is why we are 
prepared to make extraordinary 
concessions in reestablishing the 
station in a positively secure site.” 
“Name such a place!” 

“Mars. The planet Mars.” 

The Emissary stared, his 
mouth opening silently. Dr. Ames 
stared in disbelief. 

Nancy Harris gave a little 
scream. “Mars!” 

Harry nodded. “Mars.” 

The Emissary closed his mouth 
and started over. “You have no 
facilities or access to Mars.” He 
glanced around in despair. “You 
are the most preposterous people 
in all the Five Hundred Million 
Galaxies!” 

“It’s just as easy for you to 
set up your equipment on Mars 
as on Earth,” said Harry. “That’s 
not a pinpoint’s difference in lo- 


cation on your Galactic maps.” 
“You certainly know what the 
Martian terrain and atmosphere 
are like! You couldn’t exist 
there — ” 

Harry shrugged carelessly. “A 
protective dome with captive 
Terran environment would be a 
simple matter for your engineers.” 
The Emissary stared from one 
to the other as if trying to ab- 
sorb the impact of this proposal. 
“This would be a great effort — 
so great a change — for your 
people.” 

“That’s right,” said Harry 
hastily. “And that’s why I men- 
tioned remuneration to begin 
with. We could only consider 
such a project on the basis of 
very adequate remuneration — 
which you agree we haven’t had 
so far. But we’ll consider taking 
on this job — if you care to make 
an offer.” 

“There has been difficulty in 
staffing even this station. There 
would not be enough of you will- 
ing to go to Mars for such a pro- 
ject.” 

TTarry laughed heartily and 
-*■ turned slow to those behind 
him. Now was the moment of 
truth. His laugh died as he 
caught Ames’s apoplectic eye, 
and the confused countenances of 
Kipps, Stevenson, a score of en- 
gineers. He forced himself to 
laugh again. “He thinks we 


102 


GALAXY 



wouldn’t want to go to Mars. Can 
you imagine that, folks? We’d 
Jump at the chance to go to 
Mars, wouldn’t we? Wouldn’t we, 
Dr. Ames? Kipps, you’d jump at 
the chance to run this station on 
Mars, wouldn’t you?” 

The throats of some seemed to 
work with strangled words. Ames 
•tood tight-lipped and stiff. 

Harry wheeled desperately. 
"We’d go to Mars and love it, 
Wouldn’t we? Wouldn’t we — ?” 
He searched with rising panic for 
B responsive face in the immo- 
bile crowd. A smile was like a 
iudden light in the gloom. 
"Wouldn’t we, Nancy?” 

‘‘Of course we would!” Nancy 
exclaimed. “I’ve always wanted 
to go to Mars. It’s the one place 
I’d rather see than any other.” 
She turned to Ames and shook his 
immobile arm. “Don’t you agree, 
Dr. Ames? Won’t it be wonder- 
ful, living and working on Mars?” 
Ames’s immobile stature seemed 
to break, and he turned, smiling 
down at Nancy. “I can’t imagine 
anything more delightful, my 
dear.” 

Kipps simply shook his head 
In disbelieving wonder. “You did 
It, Wiseman. Damned if you 
didn’t do it.” 

“But you’ll go with us to Mars, 
won’t you?” Harry persisted. 

“Yeah. Yeah, sure I’ll go. Do 
you think you could leave me out 
of it?” 


They were all laughing then 
and pounding each other on the 
back and shaking hands and kiss- 
ing the girls. Harry turned to 
the Emissary. “You see? There’s 
no question about our going to 
Mars if you wish to provide the 
means and a proper contract.” 
The Emissary nodded uncom- 
prehendingly. “Yes, I see,” he 
said: “I see.” 

“If you care to step into the 
office back there, I think we can 
clear a desk and perhaps discuss 
terms of the contract — ” 

The Emissary strode slowly 
forward at Harry’s invitation. Be- 
hind his back Nancy threw her 
arms about Harry’s neck and 
kissed him exuberantly. 

It would be a long time, Harry 
thought, before Collins got his re- 
port on Smith Industries.

there is another solar system in 
the general neighborhood and, 
among others, they look at the 
G-type star we call the sun. 
Could they find out whether that 
star has planets? 

The condition for the discus- 
sion is that their instruments 
are not much better than ours, 
that their brains are equal to 
ours, and that their patience is 
what is needed for the job on 
hand. 

The method they, have to use is 
the one that on our planet was 
introduced by Friedrich Wilhelm 
Bessel. You very carefully meas- 
ure the position of a star and 
keep this up for a considerable 
number of years. That way you 
obtain a straight line represent- 


ing the motion of that star. Of 
course this works only with a 
star that is relatively near; no- 
body lives long enough to do that 
successfully with a distant star. 
And even if you pick a nearby 
star you can still be out of luck 
if that star happens to move 
more or less along the line of 
sight, either toward us or away 
from us. 

Bessel, to his great pleasure, 
found that the motion of Sirius 
looked like a slightly wavy line. 
The telescopes of his time did not 
show a “companion of Sirius,” 
but the wavy line proved that 
there had to be such a compan- 
ion. The reason why the line 
must be wavy is that a planet 
does not simply revolve around 


Fig. 1. The motions of two stars around their common center of gravity. The diagram 
begins with the position of extreme distance (Xa to Ya), While the more 
massive star moves from Xo to Xb, the weaker companion moves from 
Ya to Yb. The positions Xd to Yd represent the shortest possible distance 
distance between the two stars.

a star, but that, strictly speaking, 
both revolve around a common 
center of gravity. 

Theoretically this holds true 
no matter how large or how small 
the planet is; : in reality the mass 
of a very small planet could be 
neglected. If our sun had no oth- 
er planets than little Pluto, the 
center of mass of the sun-Pluto 
system would, for any practical 
purpose, be the center of the sun. 

T>ut if you have two bodies of 
.O comparable masses, say with 
the larger one three times as 
massive as the smaller one, the 
concept of “revolution around 
the common center of gravity” 
acquires reality. Fig. 1 shows an. 
example, for two stars called X 
and Y, where X is the more mas- 
sive of the pair. All the lines be- 
tween X and Y go through the 
common center of gravity (also 
called the center of gravity of 
the system) and when X is in 
position Xa, then Y must be in 
Yb, and so forth. 

The situation shown in Fig. 1 
shows the system “at rest,” as 
it were; only motion around the 
common center of gravity as as- 
sumed. In reality the whole sys- 
tem wall also move through space 
and then the performance would 
look like Fig. 2. Since I have 
picked a binary or double star 
as an example, both stars would 
be visible as a rule. But if you 


assume that the weaker of the 
two does not produce enough 
light to be visible, the visible 
partner of the pair would seem 
to move along a wavy line. 

Sirius seemed to have such a 
dark companion. Soon afterward 
it was found that Procyon also 
had a dark companion. But in 
1862 it turned out that the com- 
panion of Sirius was not dark, 
it was just small. It was the first 
of the so-called White Dwarfs 
to be discovered. And a few years 
later the companion of Procyon 
also turned out to be visible in a 
sufficiently powerful instrument.

GALAXY 




But Bessel’s method had proved 
Its value just because it had re- 
vealed the existence of two as- 
tronomical bodies before they 
could be seen. 

More recently a total of four 
"dark companions” of four dif- 
ferent stars have been discover- 
ed, and since their masses are 
quite small, it is likely that they 
are really dark. 

Now we can return to the or- 
iginal question: could an astron- 
omer residing on a planet 20 or 
30 light-years away deduce the 
existence of planets of our sun 
in this manner? In other words, 
would our sun seem to move in a 
wavy line? 

Knowing that the sun contains 
98 % of all the matter in the 
solar system one is tempted to 
say that this is unlikely: the re- 
maining 2 % do not look as if 
they could influence the other 
98 % . especially since the 2 % are 
not even concentrated in one 
body but spread over eight ma- 
jor and very many minor plan- 
ets. As happens quite often, such 
quick reasoning — though it 
sounds convincing — is neverthe- 
less off the mark. West Coast 
astronomers, after having per- 
formed the necessary calcula- 
tions, found that the planets do 
Influence the sun’s motion. 

'T'he reason why the conclusion 
■* that the 2 % of the total 


mass of the solar system can in- 
fluence the 98% represented by 
the sun is that they are very 
nearly concentrated in one body, 
namely Jupiter. 

Here is a list of the masses of 
the planets, expressed in earth 
masses: 


Mercury 

0.04 

Venus 

0.81 

Earth 

1.00 

Mars 

0.11 

Jupiter 

317.00 

Saturn 

95.00 

Uranus 

14.70 

Neptune 

17.20 


adding up to 445,86 earth mass- 
es. 

Didn’t I forget a few things? 

How about the combined mass 
of the asteroids; the four major 
moons of Jupiter: Titan, moon 
of Saturn; Triton, major moon 
of Neptune and our own rather 
large moon? I just added them 
up separately with the generous 
assumption that the total mass 
of the asteroids equals the mass 
of Mercury. The result is 0.13 
earth masses, bringing the total 
up to 445.99 earth masses. With 
all the smaller moons of the ma- 
jor planets and the comets, we 
might end up with an even 446 
earth masses. 

But look at the list again, now. 

One glance shows that Jupiter 
has more mass than all the oth- 
er planets taken together — if 
you take Jupiter away it is Sat-

for the period from 1959 to 1961 
til the four outer planets were 
roughly in the same direction as 
ieen from the sun, and the center 
of gravity of the whole system 
was 760,000 miles from the sun’s 
center or 330,000 miles from the 
tun’s surface. After that the 
planets again dispersed, mainly 
because of Jupiter’s faster or- 
bital motion. By 1965 the mass- 
center of the whole system was 
inside the sun again, and by 
1969 it will about coincide with 
the sun’s “surface” or rather the 
photosphere. Then it will move 
outside the sun again. 

The patient observer on the 
planet 20 or 30 light-years away 
will find out that the wavy line 
described by our sun has a varia- 
tion in amplitude; sometimes it 
will be less wavy than at other 
times.

ble concluding that our sun is 
orbited by at least two, but 
probably three or four, dark 
companions. Of course they will 
try to determine the masses and 
periods of revolution of the dark 
companions but since they can 
assume the existence of two, or 
three, or four companions, the 
arguments at scientific meetings 
should be lovely. Maybe, at some 
time in the future, we’ll meet 
and compare the solar system 
they have deduced with the facts 
as we know than to be. 


The Case of the “Atomic Rocket .” 

A short number of years ago 
— only three or four — the 
radio commentator Barry Far- 
ber said to me just before we 
went on the air, “My last ques- 
tion will be: if you could talk 
with one of the top men in the 
Soviet rocket program and you 
could ask him one question with 
the assurance that you’ll receive 
a truthful answer, what would 
you ask him? I am telling you 
this now so that you have a lit- 
tle time to think about the ques- 
tion you would ask.” 

When he did ask me I Had an 
answer ready. 

I would ask the Russian ex- 
pert on whether the Soviet Un- 
ion had a program for develop- 
ing a nuclear-powered rocket. 
Unfortunately I never Had the 
chance of actually asking this 
question and if I had had such 
a chance there would have been 
no assurance that I would Have 
received a truthful answer ■ — or 
an answer at all. 

But since our side has been 
thinking about nuclear rockets 
since 1946 and began actual work 
(Project Rover) in 1955, it would 
be more surprising indeed if the 
Russians were not doing a great 
deal of investigating on their 
own. 

The fundamental concept of 
the nuclear rocket is quite sim- 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


109 



pie: a suitable substance, pref- 
erably a liquid, is heated by an 
atomic reactor so that it first 
turns into a gas and then into 
a hot gas under pressure which 
escapes through an exhaust noz- 
zle like the combustion gases of 
a rocket with chemical fuels. 

The next question is what is a 
suitable substance, or rather 
what makes a substance suita- 
ble. Let us assume that you bum 
an ordinary liquid fuel like ethyl 
alcohol with the necessary 
amount of liquid oxygen, you’ll 
have an exhaust blast consisting 
of water vapor (H 2 O) and cor- 
bon dioxide (CO 2 ). It will have 
a certain exhaust velocity which 
we’ll call c (the numerical value 
will be somewhere between 6700 
and 7000 feet per second) and a 
mass equal to the amount of al- 
cohol and oxygen consumed dur- 
ing a given time, let’s say one 
second. The thrust produced by 
this exhaust blast, we’ll call it 
P, can be calculated by the fun- 
damental rocket formula 
P = c (dm/dt) 

where dm/dt is assumed to rep- 
resent the exhaust mass during 
one second. 

If you want to increase P we 
can do one of two things; we can 
increase dm/dt which means we 
can bum more fuel per second, 
or else we leave dm/dt alone and 
increase c. This usually means a 
switch to a more energetic fuel, 


but I have picked the example of 
alcohol for a specific reason; it 
is one of the few cases where c 
can be increased by another 
method. 

A s has been mentioned, the ex- 
haust consists of CO* and 
H 2 O. A molecule of CO 2 weighs 
12 -(- 16+16=44 units, the fig- 
ures being the atomic weights of 
the elements involved. A mole- 
cule of H 2 O weighs 1-|- 1 -f- 16= 18 
units. If we say for the sake of 
simplicity that the number of 
CO 2 molecules is equal to the 
number of H 2 O molecules (not 
true), the average molecular 
weight of the exhaust would be 
31 units. As we have just seen 
the CO 2 molecule weighs two and 
a half times as much as the H 2 O 
molecule. If you add water to 
the alcohol, the combustion heat 
will vaporize it and you then 
have more of the lighter mole- 
cules in the exhaust. Its average 
molecular weight is now less, 
and for this reason the exhaust 
velocity goes up. 

Of course you must not add 
so much water that the combus- 
tion temperature is lowered to a 
considerable extent. The most 
practical mixture, the one that 
was used in all large alcohol - 
burning rockets, is 75% alcohol 
with 25% water. 

The lesson learned was that 
the molecular weight of the ex- 


110 


GALAXY 



INSULATION 



haust should be as low as pos- 
sible. The lightest molecule in 
existence is that of hydrogen, but 
in a chemical rocket hydrogen 
has to be burned with some- 
thing — it could be oxygen or 
fluorine. Since fluorine is the 
most dangerous chemical ele- 
ment in existence, the choice of 
oxygen was rather obvious. Be- 
sides, the atomic weight of fluor- 
ine is 19, three units heavier than 
oxygen, so that the molecules in 
the exhaust would then weigh 
more. 

A rocket burning pure hydro- 
gen with pure oxygen produces 
tm exhaust of pure water vapor, 
with a molecular weight of 18 
units, and you cannot get any 
lighter molecules in a rocket ex- 
haust. 

Unless, of course, you don't 
burn the hydrogen. 


This is what happens (or does 
not happen, if you prefer) in the 
nuclear rocket. Fig 4 shows the 
general arrangement. The tank 
holds liquid hydrogen which is 
then pumped into what would be 
the combustion chamber in a li- 
quid fuel rocket. In the nuclear 
rocket this space is occupied by 
the nuclear reactor that is run 
as hot as it can be run without 
melting itself. The hydrogen is 
heated while it passes through 
the reactor and emerges from the 
exhaust nozzle as a hot blast of 
pure hydrogen gas. A small 
amount of this gas goes through 
a by-pass pipe to supply power 
to the turbine that drives the fuel 
pump. 

For various reasons, of which 
higher efficiency is the most im- 
portant, nuclear rockets are to 
be used as the upper stage of

111 





chemically powered rockets. 
They will, therefore, operate at 
altitudes where there is very lit- 
tle atmosphere left. If such a 
rocket were used in the lower at- 
mosphere, for- example during a 
test flight, the very hot hydro- 
gen gas would combine with the 
oxygen of the atmosphere and 
the rocket would acquire a long 
fiery trail. But this flame would 
be a secondary phenomenon that 
does not contribute to propul- 
sion. 

r T"'he first prototype of what is 
to become the NERVA (Nu- 
clear Engine for Rocket Vehicle 
Application) rocket engine was 
called Kiwi-A and underwent its 
first test run on July 1, 1959. It 
was successful with a hydrogen 
flow of 6.6 lbs/sec. 

Kiwi-B was to have ten times 
the hydrogen flow per second of 
Kiwi-A. It was first tested with 
gaseous hydrogen in December 
1961 and with liquid hydrogen 
in September 1962. Some me- 
chanical weaknesses in the reac- 
tor showed up and more tests re- 
sulted in a newer design called 
Phoebus-I. On February 23, 
1967, a Phoebus-IB reactor ran 
for a total of 30 minutes in sev- 
eral tests developing a thrust of 
75,000 pounds. And in December 
1967 a reactor called NRX-A6 
ran for 60 minutes. 

Before anybody jumps to the 


conclusion that everything is su- 
perlatively rosy when it comes 
to nuclear rockets with Hydro- 
gen exhaust, let me set down the 
disadvantages. They are what 
rocket engineers refer to as 
weight penalties, so named be- 
cause the ideal rocket consists of 
fuel and payload only; every 
ounce of everything else is look- 
ed at with hostility. 

The weight penalty trouble be- 
gins with hydrogen itself. It was 
chosen because its molecule is 
the lightest there is. In its nor- 
mal state as a gas it is the light- 
est gas there is. When liquid it 
also is a very light liquid, weigh- 
ing only 0.07 grams per cubic 
centimeter. That means that the 
tank that is to hold, say 5000 
pounds of liquid hydrogen must 
be larger than a tank that is to 
hold 5000 pounds of liquid oxy- 
gen that weighs 1.14 grams per 
cubic centimeter. Of course a 
larger tank weighs more. 

The next troublesome point is 
the temperature of liquid hydro- 
gen. In order to be a liquid, hy- 
drogen must be colder than mi- 
nus 253 degrees centigrade ( mi- 
nus 423 degrees Fahrenheit.) For 
liquid oxygen, with which there 
is far more experience, the fig- 
ures minus 183 centigrade or mi- 
nus 297 degrees Fahrenheit This 
means that the tank must be 
more heavily insulated, and there 
is another weight penalty.

TTTliat would be the empty 
» » space of the combustion 
chamber in a chemically fuelled 
rocket motor is taken up by a 
heavy reactor. Its actual weight 
has not been disclosed but it 
must weigh at least 2.5 grams 
per cubic centimeter, not count- 
ing the shielding that is needed. 

However,, these weight disad- 
vantages are fully compensated 
by the higher thrust that results 
from a higher exhaust velocity. 
The exhaust velocity of the nu- 
clear rocket will be nearly 8000 


meters/sec., corresponding to 26,- 
250 feet/sec. This is roughly 
twice as high as the highest ex- 
haust velocity obtainable with 
chemical fuels. 

At the time of writing this 
(late in June 1968) no date for 
a flight test has yet been set. As a 
matter of fact, the program may 
be menaced by budget cuts. But 
work on the all-important reac- 
tor has reached a point where 
the creation of a nuclear-pro- 
pelled rocket is only a question 
of time. —WILLY LEY

FORECAST 


By now any regular reader of Galaxy or If has become pretty familiar 
with the work of a young Californian named Larry Niven, who appeared 
from nowhere three or four years ago and has rapidly become one of the 
most popular science-fiction writers around. It's easy enough to see how the 
trick is done: All it takes is a good basic knowledge of science, willingness 
to follow one's own course instead of th© vogue of the moment — and a lot 
of talent. Niven's third book is on the way now; his crop of published 
stories mounts into the dozens; at least one of them has won science-fiction's 
top story award, the "Hugo" . and next month we offer you a short 
novel which Niven calls his best story to date. 

The name of it is The O rganleggers. We've read it twice now. Wouldn't 
be a bit surprised but what he's right. 

Cover story in the issue, also a short novel — and also a particularly 
fine one, we thought — is Ben Bova's Focman, Where Do You Flee? The 
time is the fairly near future; Man has gone into space, and discovered 
that Earth in remote history was ravaged by a technologically superb, 
militarily ruthless race . that has left no trace of its origin. Question 
Is — where are they now? And what are they up to? 

And, let's see, there's a Harlan Ellison-Keith Laumer collaboration, a 
batch of good short stories, the regular features by Algis Budrys and Willy 
Ley ... we think it's likely to be the kind of issue you remember for 
some time.

His assault on Cyra took place 
early one morning when the new- 
risen sun enchanted the new-bur- 
geoned leaves, the birds proclaim-

and the works of man were no 
more than a vagrant clink of 


milkbottles. Cyra drifted through 
the dissolving curtains of sleep, 
stretched herself with feline satis- 
faction, lay still a moment, and 
then opened her eyes. It was at 
this precise moment that the shaft 
struck her, and the world was 
changed. She was startled to 
know that she was in love. 

This, in a world where ‘love’

need some explanation. Let it be 
understood, therefore, that this 
was no top-ten parody, no en- 
trepreneur’s packaged surrogate. 
It was the authentic rosy, aching, 
wanning, enchanting, frightening, 
weakening, strengthening, beauti- 
ful, devastating, life-transmitting 
thing. And Cyra lay there, over- 
whelmed by it. 

Willie, as suddenly seen by her 
heart’s eye, differed quite con- 
siderably, she found, from Willie 
as previously seen by her mind’s 
eye — and, it must be admitted, he 
would be almost unrecognizable 
to anyone else’s eye. He had, for 
one thing, acquired' a fascinating 
amount of detail. She went over 
his face inch by inch. The hair- 
line, the eyebrows, the eyelashes, 
the eyes themselves, the texture of 
his skin, his nose, his mouth — 
she was astonished by what she 
could recall, and how nice it all 
was. And his expressions, his 
mannerisms, the way his left eye- 
brow would twitch, the way his 
smile started, and grew. She 
found she could see his hand, 
too; the way his fingers rested, 
how his nails were formed. It 
was puzzling to find so much 
information coming out of her 
own head, but very pleasant. It 
was also curious to discover that 
the coming day would be largely 
a blank until she met him in the 
evening. 

Willie Trevinnick would have 
A LIFE POSTPONED 


been flattered, but perhaps unlike 
most of his contemporaries, sur- 
prised, and a little alarmed, to 
know of this analysis going on a 
few miles away. He was possibly 
a trifle old-fashioned in regarding 
most of the girls he knew as 
persons, rather than as a kind of 
bird-seed scattered' by providence 
to feed male vanity. It would not 
have occurred to him that his fea- 
tures were either notable or do- 
table-on; nor, indeed, to anyone 
unassisted by Cyra’s insight, were 
they. Nobody, as far as is known, 
had been impelled on seeing him 
to ask: “Who is that handsome 
man?” — if only because, though 
by no means repellent, he failed 
to accord with any standards of 
type; wherefore the most com- 
mital comment was likely to be: 
“That craggy looking one over 
there. Now, he has what I call an 
interesting face.” 

It was an interesting face, but 
one that could only exceptionally 
be called genial; it frequently 
looked worried, occasionally 
scornful, most often, bewildered. 
Some there are bom to a world 
that’s tailored to receive them. 
They slip into it as, according to 
status, barrow-boys, estate-deal- 
ers, or merchant-bankers; they 
find it a fine place, they wallow 
in it, and make good. Others have 
the misfortune to feel that per- 
haps there are a few things 
wrong with it: disorder trou-

bles them, injustices irk tfwn, 
chuckle-headedness offends th em ; 
most of them manage to make 
out rattier well at that; some of 
the more sensitive may opt out, 
into clinics . 

Willie was p maker-out, but 
among thickets of misgivings on 
account of things in general. All 
the time, it seemed to him, na- 
tional politics became a wilder 
carnival of unreason; national 
ambitions, the fantasies of schi- 
zophrenics; the United Nations a 
place where emotional immaturi- 
ty could outvote the wisdom of 
experience, what there was of it 
every time; and Parliament, a 
collection of job-clingers busy 
stopping votes leaking through 
pinholes while confidence ran out 
of an open tap. Things, in fact, 
looked pretty bad in every direc- 
tion — and the prospects for pos- 
terity even worse. 

He had taken a degree, quite 
a nice degree, at London Univer- 
sity, and used it to land himself 
a job where, at least when he was 
at work, the perversity and feck- 
lessness of the outer world did 
not trouble him. He was, in fact 
an Assistant Curator in the De- 
partment of Locomotion at the 
Victoria and Albert Museum. 
He found the work interesting, 
and it was only out of office hours 
that he allowed himself to wonder 
what pre-natal sins had condemn- 
ed him to be bom into an age that 
116 


grew ever dottier as it approached 
the end of its tether. 

It was this Willie, then, who, 
rather surprisingly, and with all 
love’s unreason had become the 
apple of Cyra’s eye, the finger on 
Cyra’s heartstrings, the sun in 
Cyra’s sky. Nor was Willie in- 
different to Cyra. On the con- 
trary, she troubled him — in a 
different way from the world- 
outlook, of course, rather pleas- 
antly and insistently. He noticed 
that when she came into a room 
the voltage of the electricity sup- 
ply seemed to go up and hither- 
to beautiful flowers faded into 
insignificance and that her pres- 
ence was accompanied by a scent 
which was surely that of new- 
mown asphodel. 

It happened again that evening. 
He was awaiting her in a quiet, 
tasteful enough, though unre- 
markable restaurant when he 
heard her voice greet the door- 
man behind him. Immediately the 
whole place underwent an Elysian 
transformation; even the sherry 
he was sipping at the moment 
turned to ambrosia. 

So there is love. But love is 
ambivalent. For a woman, as you 
will undoubtedly have heard, it 
is her whole existence. For Willie 
it was, though deeply stirring, 
■provocative of tender feelings, 
and conducive of castle-building, 
nevertheless a thing somewhat 
apart — that is, apart from, and 

GALAXY 



even in some respects opposed to, 
his views and his principles. 

It was a pleasant dinner, 
amiably and unhurriedly served, 
and during the course of it they 
chatted. Indeed, Cyra prattled 
at some length of her Aunt Carola 
whose flat she had shared since 
die death of her father some two 
years ago. Her Aunt Carola was 
a dear, and she was very fond of 
her; all the same, it was not an 
arrangement that could continue 
indefinitely. She thought that 
when she was twenty-one, in 
about six month’s time, and 
would come into a little money 
of her own, she would move. One 
rather felt that Aunt Carola 
might be glad to have her place 
to herself again. The question 
was whether one might not feel 
rather lonely in a flat by one- 
self . 

By the time they had wolfed 
their way through half a bowl of 
profiterolles, Willie was confess- 
ing that his own domestic arrange- 
ments were not entirely satis- 
factory. After the death of his 
parents, slain by a drunken mo- 
torist on the Portsmouth Road, 
He had sold the house and moved 
into furnished rooms. They were 
not bad; handy to the museum, 
run by an obliging and motherly- 
disposed landlady, comfortable 
rooms, really, but, all the same 
. well, there was feeling of 
perching rather than nesting. 

A LIFE POSTPONED 


The coffee was good. Willie 
took brandy with his; Cyra 
sipped Cointreau while they con- 
sidered the imperfections of their 
circumstances. 

Willie had more brandy. Cyra 
switched to Drambuie and 
watched patiently for signs of im- 
provement in Willie’s heartbeat. 
They were small, but not dis- 
couraging. 

Willie had another brandy; 
Cyra switched back to Cointreau. 
After a time she decided that a 
transfusion might help. His hand 
was resting on the table beside 
her. She reached towards it and 
drew an elegant and thoughtful 
middle finger down the back of 
it. 

“Of course,” she said, “one way 
out would be for us to get mar- 
ried.” She paused, wondering if 
the whole restaurant could hear 
the thumping in her chest. 

Willie paused, too — for a 
dreadfully long time. Then he 
said: 

“I’d thought of that.” 

It was a difficult moment Con- 
victions which were the slow 
growth of years vied with emo- 
tions that had come to blossom 
in a month or two. The tussle was 
painful. The convictions had a 
wiry strength; the scent of the 
blossoms was heady. Willie care- 
fully kept his eyes looking 
straight ahead as he added: 

“But it wouldn’t be fair.” 


117 



Cyra withdrew her hand and 
inspected it critically. 

“Not fair?” she inquired. 

“Not fair on you,” Willie ex- 
plained. “You see, you’d want 
babies.” 

“Oh,” said Cyra. “And you 
wouldn’t?” 

“It isn’t so much that,” Willie 
told her. “It’s that introducing 
babies into the world in the state 
it’s in is — well, it’s almost a 
criminal action. For a man, that 
is. For a woman it’s different. 
She practically can’t help it — 
can’t stand against the biological 
wind, if you see what I mean.” 
: Cyra frowned a little. 

“There is — er — family plan- 
ning,” she suggested. 

“That’s not the same as no- 
family planning,” Willie pointed 
out. “And that wouldn’t be fair,” 
he repeated. 

Too much fairness, Cyra de- 
cided, wouldn’t get things far. 

“People don’t have to have 
babies, if they don’t want to,” 
she objected. 

“But nearly all women do, 
either because they do want them, 
or they think they ought to want 
them, or people expect them to 
want them. So as I said, it isn’t 
playing fair to stop them. But 
neither is it fair to a baby to 
bring it into the kind of world 
this is going to be in about 
twenty-five years’ time.” 

“That does make it difficult. 
118 


Sort of not fair either way . ” 
said Cyra, sadly. 

Willie agreed. “So,” he explain- 
ed, “the only course open to a 
scrupulous man is to opt out of 
marriage. To refuse to throw any 
progeny into the rat-race — 
which is going to get fiercer until 
it becomes rat-eat-rat.” 

“Y-e-s, I suppose so,” admitted 
Cyra. “But doesn’t that make life 
rather pointless?” 

Willie became philosophical. 
“But life is pointless, per se — 
just consider an ant-heap, teem- 
ing with pointless life. It only be- 
gins to have point when it ac- 
quires human intelligence to 
shape it. And that’s what we’re 
not doing. We’re breeding our- 
selves to destruction just as sen- 
selessly as any unintelligent form 
of life. Here we are, crowding 
closer to the edge of famine every 
year, and what happens? In this 
country, we actually subsidize 
babies when we ought to be taxing 
them. It isn’t a rational world at 
all, it’s like something thought 
up by Gilbert and Carroll. We’re 
in a state of unguided transition. 
What fascinates me is what is 
going to happen when the crunch 
comes. Will it be savagery, tech- 
nocracy, or annihilation?” 

“I don’t see how your not hav- 
ing a son or daughter is going to 
stop any of them.” 

“Oh, it isn’t. But at least it 
won’t be on my conscience that I 

GALAXY 



am responsible for some wretched 
descendant having to face the 
ghastly music when it comes.” 

“If it comes.” 

“It’ll come all right — unless 
somebody takes charge. That 
might just give us a chance. But 
can you see any sign of that hap- 
pening? God, I’d like to know 
what’s going to be the end of it.” 

Cyra was beginning to feel 
bored, and a little depressed — 
not discouraged; she had, after 
all, fired only her first live round 
— but she had heard quite a lot 
of this kind of thing before. No 
doubt it was very interesting if 
you happened to have that kind 
of mind, but if you didn’t, 
it was exasperating and frustrat- 
ing. She appreciated that princi- 
ples were generally considered 
worthy things to have, they gave 
a kind of cachet — well, you’d 
only have to think of the word 
“unprincipled” to realize that — 
at the same time it could be 
difficult to have patience with 
principles when they interfered 
with real life. 

Normally any conflict between 
love and principles can easily be 
resolved by the catalystic appli- 
cation of another principle: if 
you can’t lick ’em, join ’em. Thus 
it is only necessary for one party 
to profess the principles of the 
other party, and all is harmony. 
But this was rather a special case; 
it would unfortunately require her 
A LIFE POSTPONED 


to profess simultaneously that it 
was unfair for her not to have a 
baby, and unfair to the baby to 
get born. Not a dilemma solvable 
off the cuff. It needed considera- 
tion — a subtle, possibly even a 
devious, approach. 

Willie had another brandy, 
Cyra reswitched to Drambuie, but 
conversation became spasmodic, 
lapsing now and then into 
thoughtful pauses. 

II 

/^iyra awoke the following morn- 
ing aware at once that she 
still loved Willie; aware, too, 
that, in his male way, Willie 
loved her. The trouble seemed to 
lie in the schizoid natures of men. 
They not only had too many in- 
terests, but they appeared to be 
incapable of arranging them in 
order of relative importance — 
an incapacity which, she suspect- 
ed, might be at the root of many 
of the political troubles of the 
world. They were forever com- 
plicating the simple by the appli- 
cation of principles — and dif- 
fering principles, at that. 

Not that she had any objec- 
tions to Willie’s Principle Num- 
ber One; in fact she agreed with 
it. It was Principle Number Two 
that was the obstacle — how to 
convince him that, whatever kind 
of mess the world was headed for, 
a baby had a right to get bom. 

119 



Of course, when you allowed 
yourself to think of the kind of 
future which’ at least half the 
world’s present population of ba- 
bies were bound to face, it was 
difficult to think of convincing 
arguments in favor of more . 
But there she was, falling into the 
trap of male theorizing again . 
Clear the decks . She, as a 
woman, had a right to have babies 
if she wanted them . No, more 
than that — the race must go on; 
she could do her bit to see that 
it did, therefore it was plainly 
her duty to have babies . Put 
that way it did sound a bit Old 
Testament and coercive, perhaps, 
but . Oh, to hell with argu- 
ments! She wanted Willie. She 
also wanted babies. All she need- 
ed was to find some way of un- 
horsing this principle, and she 
could have both’. 

Willie, too, was having principle 
trouble. Any agreement not to 
have children would not only be 
unfair to Cyra; it would not work 
And if you tried to make it work 
you’d have the makings, too, of 
an old-fashioned, three-act farci- 
cal comedy — one quite unfunny 
for the participants. 

On the other hand . 

Willie had thought a lot, per- 
haps rather too much, about the 
other hand. Practically everyone 
he knew appeared to think that 
their children, in whatever cir- 
cumstances, were lucky to have 
120 


got bom at all and ought to be 
grateful for it. Even in regions 
where the life of man was ac- 
knowledged to be nasty, brutish' 
and short they rejoiced that a 
new one had arrived to suffer it 
and hoped that it would survive 
long enough to have children 
whose lives would also be nasty, 
brutish and short. It was. He sup- 
posed, the Life Force at work; 
he did not think highly of the 
Life Force’s method. It seemed to 
be, in essence: chuck ’em in, and 
see which of ’em float. And even 
if you dignified this technique by 
calling it Natural Selection, it was 
still no way for an intelligent 
species to let things non them- 
selves — not at the best of 
times, let alone in an age which 
was heading hell-bent for the 
worst of times. As he saw it, if 
somebody didn’t get a bridle on 
this Life Force pretty soon, it 
would bolt into utter catastrophe. 

“Why," Willie asked himself, 
“why did I have to be born into 
this age of messup? Why not in- 
to one that offered a better fu- 
ture than my grandchildren dying 
of want? But there it is. You’ve 
only got to look around; the old 
controls are failing, the break-up 
is already setting in . And it 
doesn’t need much to check it 
even now — just the application 
of a little reason and sanity.” 

He fell to wondering for the 
hundredth time whether it would 

GALAXY 



lomehow be checked at the last 
moment. Most people seemed 
content to live on the principle 
that things would turn out all 
right — but even the people who 
scornfully watched Noah building 
his ark must have done that. 

He did not know what would 
happen; he would very much like 
to know; in fact, he would des- 
perately like to know. For, after 
all, if it wasn’t going to be check- 
ed, what was the' point in going 
on living, anyway? 

C yra found Willie’s letter on 
the breakfast table three or 
four days later. She opened it with 
excitement, began to read it with 
incredulity, turned back to the 
beginning, read it all through 
with utter stillness, and then 
raised eyes that had become un- 
seeingly blank. Aunt Carola re- 
garded her with anxiety. 

“What is it, darling? What’s 
the matter?” she asked and 
reached across the table to lay 
her hand on Cyra’s. Cyra did not 
reply. Then the blankness 
gradually faded. Her face crum- 
pled. 

“H-Ke says He-he’s em-em-emi- 
grating,” she wailed, and burst 
into tears. 

Vestiges of dignity, suriviving 
from a vanished era inhibited 
Cyra from action for nearly a 
week, until modem common sense 
asserted itself to point out that 
A LIFE POSTPONED 


dignity got you nowhere nowa- 
days. So she called at Willie’s 
lodgings. 

The landlady recognized her, 
and was sympathetic. 

“Such an upset, Miss. Here 
three years, he was, and then 
gone in a couple of days. I can’t 
hardly believe it yet. But he did 
right by us. Paid me up to the 
end of the quarter, he did, though 
he didn’t have to, and there’s 
many as wouldn’t.” 

“It really was very sudden, 
then?” asked Cyra. 

“Bless you, yes. Not a hint till 
it happened. Though he was kind 
of thoughtful for a few days be- 
fore. Making up his mind, I sup- 
pose. Then Tuesday of last week 
He said to me; ‘Mrs. Duke, I’m 
sorry to tell you that I’ll have to 
leave. I’ve been offered a very 
good job aboard, but the con- 
dition is that I take it up at once.’ 
And he was off the next day, and 
the day after that Harrod’s van 
called for his things, and that’s 
all I know.” 

“Abroad?” said Cyra. “Didn’t 
he leave a forwarding address?” 

Mrs. Duke looked at her for a 
moment. 

“Oh, dear,” she said, compas- 
sionately. “You come in and have 
a nice cup of tea, dearie. I’ll tell 
you all I can. OK, dear, it’s not 
like him at all. Always such' a 
gentleman, Mr. Trevinnick. OK, I 
am so sorry.” 


121 



Cyra’s next call was at Har- 
rods. They were cautiously dis- 
creet there, but by persistence she 
learned that he had left no ad- 
dress with them, other than that 
where his effects were to be col- 
lected. Indeed,* they presumed 
Mr. Trevinnick contemplated a 
lengthy absence, for his storage 
account, they admitted in confi- 
dence, was to be paid by banker’s 
order. 

Cyra knew enough of bankly 
reticence to discard any idea of 
approaching from that direction, 
so she retired to the restaurant to 
think. After a time she unexpect- 
edly recalled that Willie had once 
or twice mentioned his solicitor 
by name. But what was the 
name? She thought back. She 
could distinctly recall being 
struck by something Chaucerian 
about it . But there were such 
a lot of names in Chaucer: Mil- 
ler, Reeve, Franklyn, Squire, 
Nunn — oh, endless! Then, sud- 
denly she had it! She bolted the 
rest of her lunch and made for 
the telephone directory. Half an 
hour later she was on the steps of 
a house in Bedford Row, pressing 
a bell beneath a brass plate which 
proclaimed: Coghall, Coghall & 
Sprint. Commissioners for Oaths. 

Mr. Martin Coghall was able 
to receive her with little delay, 
and regarded her with interest as 
she entered his room. Cyra had a 
vaguely elusive impression that he 
122 


was not entirely surprised to see 
her. His manner was kindly, even 
friendly, though not forthcoming, 
and his attitude as he listened to 
her was circumspect. She con- 
cluded : 

“In his letter to me he told 
me that he was emigrating. But 
his landlady says he had a sud- 
den offer of a post abroad. That 
doesn’t seem to me quite right; 
I mean, you don’t say you are 
emigrating if you are just taking 
a job aboard, do you? Please, 
please tell me if you know where 
he is. It’s all so mysterious not 
leaving an address, or anything. 
He might — ” She paused as a 
sudden thought struck her. “ — 
Oh! Oh, no! He’s not had to go 
to prison, or something like that, 
has he?” 

The solicitor leaned forward 
and patted her hand, not quite 
professionally, perhaps, but reas- 
suringly. 

“My dear Miss Chapworth. 
You can put any idea of that kind 
right out of your mind. Mr. 
Tevinnick has gone away, it is 
true. It is also true that we have 
no way of getting in touch with 
him at present, but I do assure 
you that the decision was entirely 
his own.” 

“But why? Why? He hasn’t 
really taken a job aboard, has he? 
He’d have said something about 
it to me . .” 

Her eyes began to fill. 

GALAXY 



Mr. C agnail leaned forward. He 
<aid earnestly: 

“Miss Chapworth. Mr. Trevin- 
ulck has spoken to me of you. I 
hope you will believe me when 
I assure you that he is very, very 
(ond of you.” 

Cyra stared at him. 

“He has,” she said, “a pretty 
lousy way of showing it.” 

Mr. Coghall looked momentari- 
ly taken aback, but he rallied, 
ind shook his head reprovingly. 

“Not entirely,” he said. “Before 
Mr. Trevinnick left, he invested 
US with the power of attorney re- 
garding his affairs, so if you 
should chance to hear of any out- 
standing debts we should be glad 
If you will put the claimants in 
touch with us.” He looked in- 
quiringly. Cyra nodded. He went 
on: “I may also say that you will 
shortly be receiving a letter from 
Us informing you, on the instruc- 
tions of our client, that should 
you at any time find yourself in 
want, or need of assistance, you 
Should apply to us for help and 
■dvice.” 

Cyra stare dat him. Tears be- 
gan to brim up again. She fought 
them back and said, unsteadily: 
“But the only advice I need is 
where to find Willie.” 

Mr. Coghall’s expression was 
sympathetic, but he shook his 
head slowly. 

“That, my dear Miss Chap- 
worth, I regret to say I could not 
A LIFE POSTPONED 


at this precise moment tell you, 
even were I at liberty to do so.” 

Cyra pounced on “precise mo- 
ment.” 

“But when you do hear from 
him, you will let me know?” 

Mr. Coghall hesitated, con- 
sidered and replied carefully: 

“You may rest assured that if 
we do hear from him we shall let 
you know.” 

A few minutes later he showed 
her out with avuncular considera- 
tion, and, when the door was 
closed, drew a handkerchief from 
his breast pocket to dab his brow. 

Cyra descending the steps, saw 
a tax isetting down a fare at the 
next house. She hurried to catch 
it. 

"The Victoria and Albert 
Museum, please,” she told the 
driver. 

Ill 

A Tr. Simon Radgrove, Curator 
of the Department of Lo- 
comotion, regarded his visitor 
benevolently. The average age of 
callers in his department was 
noticeably lower than that in 
most other Departments, but not 
many of them introduced an 
aura of youth and spring. He in- 
quired what had brought this 
about. She explained, concluding: 
“I understand he resigned his 
post here to take up another 
abroad, but nobody can tell me 

123 



where. It was all so sudden you 
see. There are things to be 
settled — I don’t mean debts, 
those are cleared — but personal 
arrangements, things we must get 
in touch with him about.” 

“Oh,” said 1 Mr. Radgrove. “I 
confess I had not heard anything 
about a post abroad — I think 
you must have been misinformed 
about that” He shook his head. 
“No. Mind you, he did not ac- 
tually confide his intentions to 
me, but, putting two and two to- 
gether, I don’t think that can be 
right — unless, of course, it was 
purely temporary.” 

He mused. 

“But if he resigned his job 
here — ” began Cyra, and then 
stopped. For all she knew, Willie 
might Have been sacked. Indeed, 
for a moment Mr. Radgrove’s 
reply seemed to suggest that 
that was so. 

“There again,” He told her, “I 
fear you Have been misinformed. 
Mr. Trevinnick Has not, in fact, 
resigned His post Here.” He paus- 
ed, and Cyra braced Herself for 
a revelation. “Oh', no,” Mr. Rad- 
grove went on. “On the con- 
trary. He is a very useful man, 
you know. He was very keen that 
his job should be kept open for 
him. Fortunately, his application 
was received' just in time to be 
included in the agenda for the 
meeting of Curators the follow- 
ing day. We discussed it with 
124 


great interest. Most unusual rr 
quest. It creates a precedent, ol 
course, but not, it was thought, 
one that was likely to be extcn' 
sively exploited. Some members, 
in fact, felt that it might yield 
useful benefits. So, in the end, 
it was decided to grant his re- 
quest. ” 

Cyra felt that something ini 
portant had been omitted. 

“Yes, but what was his re- 
quest?” she wanted to know. 

“OH, didn’t I make that clear? 
I’m so sorry. Yes, it was leave o( 
absence.” 

“Oh,” said Cyra, a little flatly 
“And you say there was no men- 
tion of his going abroad?” 

“None whatever. I should 
think that very unlikely — very 
unlikely indeed.” 

Cyra reflected. She was unde- 
cided whether the answer left 
her feeling more frustrated, or 
less. She thought back, and ask- 
ed: 

“Why did you find the request 
so unusual?” 

“Did I say “unusual’? Perhaps 
I should have said ‘unique’.” 

“Perhaps, but why?” 

“I doubt whether it has even 
been requested before. All of us 
doubted it." 

“What, a leave of absence I 
Surely — ” 

“No, no. This was an extended 
leave of absence.” 

Cyra tried not to let Her sigh 
GALAXY 



be obvious. Patiently she asked: 

“Please, please, Mr. Radgrove. 
Just how much leave of absence 
was Mr. Trevinnick asking for?” 

“Oh’, didn’t I tell you that?” 
said Mr. Radgrove, in surprise. 
“Why, it was a hundred years 
— unpaid, of course.” 

IV 

A week later Cyra climbed the 
ill-kept staircase of a dingy 
house in Gerrard Street. On the 
third floor she found a door pan- 
elled with obscured glass on 
which was painted QUESTERS 
LTD. She pressed the bell-punch 
beside it. A youth with a suspi- 
cious expression and an under- 
privileged lower lip opened the 
door and blocked the entrance 
while he scrutinized Her carefully. 

“I Have an appointment to see 
Mr. Marrow,” she told Him. 

“Oh',” said the youth. “Better 
come in.” 

He stood aside for her to pass, 
closed the door behind Her, and 
disappeared into an inner room, 
to reappear almost immediately. 

“This way,” he told Her. 

Mr. Marrow rose from his desk 
to greet her and push' forward a 
chair. He was a well-built man of, 
she judged, about thirty-five; 
smartly dressed, with dark, neat- 
ly brushed hair and a somewhat 
careworn face. His manner was a 
trifle over-gallant, as if to com- 

A LIFE POSTPONED 


pensate for his employee’s lack 
of grace. 

“Mm. Brace, of Hampsted, 
recommended you to me. I would 
like you to make an inquiry,” 
she told him. 

Mr. Marrow’s gaze flickered 
momentarily towards her left 
hand and then away again. 

“No,” said Cyra. “Not that 
kind of inquiry.” 

Mr. Marrow made a non-com- 
mit al noise and' waited. Cyra 
went on: 

“Do you know anything about 
the Cloverdon Biological Re- 
search Unit?” 

“Never heard of it,” admitted 
Mr. Marrow, and made a note. 

“Well, it’s a place where they 
run a number of experimental 
medical projects.” 

“Secret projects?” inquired 
Mr. Marrow. “Because, I mean, 
if it’s one of those government 
places like Harwell — ” 

“It isn’t,” Cyra told him. “It’s 
a private establishment endowed 
by the late Sir William Greeting 
and administered by the Greet- 
ing Foundation.” 

“Oh,” said Mr. Marrow. 
“What goes on there?” 

“Well, they’ve a number of 
projects on hand, I understand, 
but the only one that interests 
me is their work on suspended 
animation.” 

“Come again,” suggested Mr. 
Marrow. 


125 



“Suspended animation,” Cyra 
repeated. "I believe they freeze 
people there.” 

Mr. Marrow goggled and be- 
came a fair sample of suspended 
animation himself. 

"Freeze people?” he inquired. 

“Yes. Sort of put them into 
cold storage for a time and then 
thaw them out later on. You 
must have heard of it. Lots of 
countries have teams working on 
it.” 

“Oh,” said Mr. Marrow again, 
conveying in one simple sound 
that he had neither heard of it, 
nor believed it now. 

Cyra regarded him. 

"Mr. Marrow, you don’t seem 
to know much about the world 
you’re living in,” she said. 

“You’d be surprised, lady,” 
Mr. Marrow told her. 

“Well, the scientific side of it, 
anyway,” Cyra modified. “Now 
I have managed to find out that 
this Cloverdon place is not un- 
willing to accept volunteers for 
their experiments — ” 

“What, willing to be froz- 
en?” exclaimed Mr. Marrow. 

“Yes. Not many, of course. 
And it all has to be very discreet 
because the papers and the 
B.B.C. would have one of their 
moral tournaments if they got 
hold of it. You can just imagine.” 

“I’ll say,” agreed Mr. Mar- 
row. 

“Well, I Have reason to think 
126 


that a Mr. William Trevinnick 
has been one of their volunteers. 
If he was, what I want to know 
is the date he went to them, and 
most importantly, the exact date 
set for his resuscitation.” 

"His re-what?” 

“His revival. The day when 
they’ll bring him out of it again.” 
“I see.” Mr. Marrow made a 
note of the name William Tre- 
vinnick and considered it. Cyra 
said: 

“It is most important that 
these inquiries should be abso- 
lutely confidential. It don’t want 
the Cloverdon people to have any 
suspicion that they are being 
made.” 

“Of course,” agreed Mr. Mar- 
row, mechanically. 

“Well, can you do it?” 

It did not seem quite an oc- 
casion for Mr. Marrow’s confi- 
dent just-you-leave-it-to-us re- 
ply. He said: 

“I’ll do my best. Have a look 
around first; get the feel of the 
place. Let you know how the 
chances are.” 

He paused. “ ’Fraid it may 
cost you a bit.” 

They got down to business. 

\ little over three weeks passed 
before Cyra made her way to 
Gerrard Street again. She found 
Mr. Marrow in good' spirits. 

“Well, we done — did it,” he 
told her triumphantly. “Never 

GALAXY 



lay Jimmy Marrow lets a client 
down. Took quite a bit of greas- 
ing though,” he added, more so- 
berly. 

“How much?” inquired Cyra. 

He named a figure. 

Cyra got up to go. 

“Now don’t take it like that. 
I warned you it might come a 
bit high,” he protested. 

“Not as high as that,” said 
Cyra, moving towards the door. 

“Now come — ” he pleaded. 

They haggled. 

“You’re a -one,” He said, re- 
garding her with respect at the 
end of it. 

“Not done too badly your- 
lelf, Cyra told him. “Right, 
now then, let’s have it.” 

TV /[ r Morrow opened a drawer 
in his desk and drew forth a 
piece of paper. He read from his 
notes : 

“Mr. William Trevinnick did 
go to the Cloverdon Biological 
Research Unit. He first contacted 
them on the eleventh of May last 
year ...” 

Cyra’s eyebrows went up. She 
had not met Willie until the pre- 
vious September. Mr. Marrow 
went on : 

“On the sixth of June last — 
that is, about a month later, he 
went to them for a thorough 
medical examination — which 
gave him a general okay. They 
made inquiries about him — 

A LIFE POSTPONED 


whether he was on the straight, 
or up to any funny business, or 
suchlike; that was all okay, too. 
Then on the third of May last 
he contacted them by pKone. No 
record of the conversation. On 
the fifth of May He went there 
himself ...” 

Cyra nodded. She had stipu- 
lated the .date of Willie’s entry 
as the only check she could think 
of on Mr. Marrow’s reliability. 
It stood up. 

“And the date for his resusci- 
tation?” she asked, calmly 
enough'. 

Mr. Marrow hesitated, looked 
embarrassed and fiddled with a 
pencil. 

“This is honest, Miss. Take 
me Bible oath. Didn’t believe it 
myself when I saw it. Had them 
double check it.” 

Cyra nodded again. 

“All right,” she said. “Let’s 
have it.” 

Mr. Marrow took a very deep 
breath. 

“He’s down for resuscitation 
on the tenth of August — tenth 
of August in — ” he paused “ — 
in the year of twenty ninety- 
five.” 

He ended with' some defi- 
ance, and raised his eyes uncer- 
tainly. 

“Thank you, Mr. Marrow,” 
said Cyra. “That’s all I wanted 
to know. Thank you very, very 
much.”

"IXTillie came to with a feeling 
* * of warmth. Then there was 
a click, the sound of something 
sliding, and the sense of warmth 
diminished. He couldn’t see, 
couldn’t move. Suddenly there 
was a tube between his lips. A 
voice said: “Drink this.” A little 
liquid trickled into his mouth. 
He swallowed successfully. Then 
there was more liquid. The most 
delicious drink he had ever 
tasted. 

He was aware of people mov- 
ing about him, applying instru- 
ments to him, here, there and 
everywhere. He lay quietly, let- 
ting them get on with it. The 
surrounding activity abated. A 
voice asked : 

“How are you feeling?” 

“Tired.” Willie told it. “And 
I can’t see.” 

“Don’t worry about that, you 
have got a mask on, we have to 
take it easy with the eyes.” 

Take what easy with the eyes, 
Willie wondered. Suddenly it all 
came back to him. 

“I’ve made it, then?” he asked. 

“You’ve made it fine. A text- 
book job. Nothing to worry 
about at all. I guess you’d like 
to sleep now.” 

“Yes,” agreed Willie, and he 
seemed to fall asleep instantly. 

There was an indeterminate 
interval punctuated by meals. 

128 


Food was so comforting that lie 
went to sleep again the moment 
he had finished it. At some time 
they had removed the mask, and 
at his waking he became aware 
that he was lying in a dimly lit, 
institutional room. Then came 
one time when he awoke feeling, 
though uncertainly as yet, more 
like himself. 

A nurse in a white overall wai 
doing something beside the bed, 
He rolled his head on the pil- 
low. She turned to look at him, 

“Ah, that’s better,” she said, 
“How do you feel now?” 

“Weak,” he admitted. “Other- 
wise all right — I think.” 

“It’ll pass in a day or two. You 
will be as fit as ever,” she as- 
sured him. 

“What day is it?” He asked 

"Saturday,” she told him. 

“It ought to be Wednesday," 
he said. 

“You came out of it on Wed- 
nesday, the tenth of August, 
Now it’s Saturday, the thir- 
teenth.” 

“And the year?” 

“You don’t think we’d che;il, 
do you? Twenty ninety-five, ol 
course.” 

Willie lay back, trying to ab 
sorb it. Presently the nurse said: 
“I have to go for a bit now 
Would you like the television?" 
She handed him a small bo* 
with a number of buttons and m 
knob on it and bustled out. 


GALAXY 




Willie pressed a button exper- 
imentally. Immediately a piece 
of the wall opposite his bed lit 
up. It was hard to believe He 
was not looking through the wall 
into a street. 'The scene was ster- 
eoscopic, the colors natural, and 
the realism uncanny — unpleas- 
ant, too. The town looked ori- 
ental. There was a riot in prog- 
ress; men in gasmasks were us- 
ing sticks and shields to break it 
up; amid the background noise 
was a rattle of a light machine- 
gun. The world did not seem to 
have changed much’. 

Willie pressed another button 
and got some music, or at least 
musicians with’ instruments, 
though the sounds they were 
making were unintelligible. He 
tried a third button and saw 
some rather surprising exercises 
being performed by boys and 
girls in pairs, for the purpose, 
he gathered from the commen- 
tary, of promoting healthily nor- 
mal social integration. 

Ah, well, doubtless one would 
have to make adjustments; but 
it was consoling to know that, 
so far at least, the world seemed 
to have succeeded in avoiding 
the disintegration of a new dark 
age. 

The next day he felt distinctly 
better, well enough to get up 
and move around a little in a 
slightly staggery way. He had 
his mid-day meal in an armchair 

130 


with a table drawn up across it. 
The food no longer tasted quite 
so good and was difficult to 
identify, but he was hungry 
enough to be glad of it. When 
the nurse came to collect the 
tray she said: “A visitor for you 
this afternoon — unless you’re 
not feeling up to it.” 

Willie stared at her. 

“A visitor for me? But I don’t 
know anybody here. What 
name?” 

She shrugged. 

“I don’t know. They just said 
a visitor.” 

Willie considered. According 
to the arrangement, he would 
still be officially on leave until 
the first of September — a fort- 
night next Thursday, providing 
nobody had reformed the calen- 
dar — but the Museum, must, 
of course, be interested. They had 
probably investigated and were 
sending someone to greet him. 

It was, therefore, considerably 
disconcerting for him when, as 
the door opened and the nurse 
announced his visitor, Cyra walk- 
ed in. Indeed, he sat there, gog- 
gling at her speechlessly. 

“Hullo, Willie. How are you 
feeling now?” she asked, as she 
sat down in the other chair. 

He went on staring, mouth 
slightly open, but no sound 
emerging. A sort of stammer 
came from it at last. 

“But-but-they-they told me 

GALAXY 



this was twenty-ninety five,” He 
managed. 

“So it is, Willie. And it was 
really very naughty of you to 
come Here without telling any- 
body,” she said. 

“But — but — ” Willie be- 
gan again. 

Stop butting at me and star- 
ing like that, Willie. I’m quite 
real. I’ll show you.” 

She came closer, leaned down, 
and planted a firm kiss. 

Presently Willie leaned back, 
feeling a little dizzy. 

“Explain,” He told her. 

“Well,” said Cyra, “When I 
found out where you’d gone I 
thought it would be better if I 
were to come Here first and sort 
of get things ready, so I arrived 
about three weeks ago. And I’ve 
got us a flat — quite a nice flat, 
I think — and Handy for the 
Museum, and — ” 

“Hold on a minute,” Willie 
protested. “How did you get 
here?” 

“Why, the same way you did, 
of course. They were a bit sticky 
about it at the Cloverdon Re- 
search place. They said nearly 
all their volunteers were older 
people suffering from something 
they hoped there’d be a cure 
found for by the time they came 
out of it. And I said, then it 
ought to be a nice change for 
them to have somebody young 
and healthy, and why not? So 

A LIFE POSTPONED 


we argued quite a lot, but they 
agreed in the end. 

“The worst part was waiting 
for it, because I couldn’t sign all 
the proper things until I was 
twenty-one, in November. And 
I’ll admit that I did nearly give 
up once or twice; it got a bit 
gruesome picturing oneself all 
frozen stiff like a block of fish 
— well, more like one of those 
crusader’s ladies you see lying 
on tombs, I suppose, really — 
anyway, being like that for years, 
and years, and years. However, 
I stuck it out and tried to keep 
my mind occupied with the ar- 
rangements.” 

“Arrangements?” Willie in- 
quired. 

“Well, I came into a little 
money from my father at twen- 
ty-one. So, of course, I Had to 
decide whether simply to invest 
it at compound interest, or put 
it into unit-accumulators, or set 
up a trust for myself. I did think 
of an annuity, but it seemed to 
frighten the company. So, in the 
end, I did all the other three, a 
bit of each.” 

“Did you indeed!” said Willie, 
looking at Her with a new re- 
spect. 

She nodded: “They're all done 
quite well really, in spite of two 
or three capital levies. What did 
you do?” 

“I — er — Just left it on de- 
posit,” Willie admitted. 

131 



“Oh, well — it will have in- 
crease! quite a bit,” she said. 
There was a pause. “It’s not a 
bit like you said it would be 
here,” she observed. “Nobody 
starving. No people in rags fight- 
ing over scraps of food. The 
food’s a bit funny because it’s 
dull, so they flavor it, but there’s 
plenty of it. 

“As far as I’ve gathered, things 
did get a bit grim about seventy 
years ago. Then there was an- 
other grim patch about thirty 
years later; not standing-room 
only, just too many people who 
were too old to work; but about 
twenty years after that it had 
evened out once more, and they 
got the population fixed. Now 
there’s a row going on because 
the expectation of life has gone 
up a bit, and the young are pro- 
testing that it’s unfair to youth." 

“That sounds a whole lot bet- 
ter than I expected.” Willie ad- 
mitted. “I was more than half- 
ready to find barbarism. How 
did they do it?” 

“I’m not sure. Nobody I’ve 
talked to yet seems to know for 
certain. Most of them think it’s 
something in the water, some of 
theta say it’s something in the 
food, others tell you it’s in the 
atmosphere. Anyway, whatever 
it is, it works — no babies with- 
out a license.” 

Willie considered the point. 

“That could make a difference 

132 


all around,” he suggested dryly. 

“Oh, it does,” Cyra assured 
him. 

She let it go at that for the 
moment; presently she inquired: 
“What were you planning to do 
when you got here?” 

“I didn’t plan. It would de- 
pend on what I found. If it were 
barbarism, well, I suppose I’d 
have to take my chance. If it 
were orderly, there’d be my job 
at the Museum, and I’d have to 
find somewhere to live, and do 
my best to settle in.” He paused, 
and looked at her. “I think I 
must Have been a little mad to 
come at all,” he added thought- 
fully. 

She ignored that for a mo- 
ment. 

“You wouldn’t Have found it 
easy — getting somewhere to 
live, I mean — not on your own,” 
she remarked. 

‘*Why not?” 

“It’s not done Here. People 
who try are regarded as peculiar, 
undesirable. They’re not socially 
integrated — and that seems a 
pretty bad thing not to be. It’s 
all right for a week or two, might 
happen to anyone, but if it goes 
on, you’re likely to be sent on a 
rehabilitation course. I had a 
bit of difficulty over this flat. 
In fact I only got it by assuring 
them that you’d been sent abroad 
on business and would be back 
before long. So if you don’t come 

GALAXY 



there I shall have to give it up, 
and you'll Have nowhere to go.” 
“OK,” said Willie.

/"\ne of tfie advantages of deal- 
^ ing witH tKe past is that it 
itays relatively put. Consequent- 
ly Willie did not experience any 
great difficulties in taking up his 
Job at the Museum again. Ad- 
mittedly there were new systems 
Of classification, new procedures, 
new methods of administration 
and new people, but he found 
adaption fairly easy, and the 
new people surprisingly like the 
old people. For a month or so, 
Be was something of a museum 
exhibit Himself, but when the 
novelty Had worn off and when 
he was alone in his Department, 
unrounded by the familiar and 
fearsome complexities thought up 
by long vanished engineers, there 
was little to distinguish the pres- 
ent century from the last. He 
liked it there, found it soothing 
— which was more than could 
be said for the world outside. 

He was apt to return to the 
flat put out. 

“Really,” he complained to 
Cyra, one evening, “the indecen- 
cies of this place! I took a lunch- 
time walk in the Gardens, and 
do you know what was going on 
b front of Kensington Palace, 
right under the nose of Queen 
A LIFE POSTPONED 


Victoria’s statue?” She did not, 
so Ke told her. “I’m no puritan, 
but Kang it all, I mean, and with! 
the bystanders laying bets, tool” 
“What on?” inquired Cyra, 
with interest. 

“If you must know — ” said 
Willie, and told her that, too. 

Cyra giggled. “It’s known here 
as expressing oneself,” she in- 
formed Him. “After all, they’ve 
done away with the old deter- 
rents.” 

“No morals at all. Not evert 
the decencies of a well run farm- 
yard,” asserted Willie. 

“You’re going back a bit, Wil- 
lie, aren’t you?” 

“I don’t care. You know what 
I mean. It’s degenerate.” 

“Come, come,” Cyra soothed 
him. “TKe young always were; 
the world always is.” 

Willie frowned at Her. 

“I sometimes wonder about 
your standards,” he said, severe- 
ly- 

Cyra shrugged. “I doubt 
whether much comes of applying 
the standards of one century to 
the behavior of the next. The 
point is that through them all 
life somehow battles on.” 

“It does indeed,” Willie agreed. 
“But thank goodness they’ve Had 
the sense to restrict the call-up 
at last.” He brooded a little. “It 
is all very dispiriting.” He an- 
nounced. “It’s true the Human 
race isn’t going to breed itself 

133 




into starvation now, the rat race 
Isn’t as bitter as one feared, there 
doesn’t seem to be any likelihood 
of us descending to tooth-and- 
claw savagery. BUT it’s uncivil- 
ized, all this lack of inhibition, 
the open promiscuity, and so on; 
It chops away the roots of all 
Social order, destroys the basic 
pattern. It’s certainly not the kind 
of world I should bring a child 
Into.” 

“OK. I don’t know ... I mean, 
was it ever? But people kept on 
doing it,” CyTa pointed out. 
Willie was looking thoughtful. 
“Incidently,” he said, “I Hadn’t 
thought of it before, but how do 
babies get bom here.” 

“They issue licenses,” Cyra 
told Him. “It’s all very carefully 
regulated. Suitable health of par- 
ents, et cetera. And that means 
they can calculate the number of 
school places needed, the num- 
ber of teachers, and insure a fair 
education.” 

“OH,” said Willie. “Well if this 
— ” he waved an arm to include 
Kensington Gardens, and de- 
pravity in general. “If this is the 
result, I don’t think mucH of it.” 
They reflected. After a time, 
Cyra suggested tentatively: 

“We could, perhaps, do our 
little bit towards helping to re- 
store standards.” 

Willie looked at her. “How?” 
He asked. 

“Well, here we are, living in 

A LIFE POSTPONED 


this flat. It would at least set £ 
good example if we were to get 
married. People still do, you 
know — some of them.” 

Willie demurred. 

“Is there much point in get- 
ting married if we’re not having 
children? I mean, you’ve only 
got to read the marriage serv- 
ice .. ” 

“I think I’d rather like to, all 
the same . Just for the prin- 
ciple of the thing. I mean, after 
all we’re bound to be a bit old- 
fashioned in our ideas, and if we 
do believe in those standards you 
were talking about, well . ?” 
Cyra left the question open-end- 
ed. 

Willie tKougKt it over. 

“All right,” He agreed, “let’s do 
that. After all, it will show a few 
of them that standards can be 
applied, even in this permissive 
world.” 

Cyra kissed Kim. 

“Good,” she said. “Tomorrow 
I’ll find out How they do it here.”

^lyra fell down, facing the doctor 
^ across His polished desk. He 
asked what he could do for her. 

“I’d like a baby license, 
please,” said Cyra. 

“H’m,” said the doctor, look- 
ing at her. “You have to be mar- 
ried, of course.” 

“OH, I am,” Cyra assured Him.

She produced Her certificate, 
and Handed it across. 

TEe doctor read it. His eye- 
brows rose. He looked at it Hard- 
ier. “Date of birth’: November 
£1974. Husband’s, date of birtH: 
May 1969.” He* murmured, and 
looked at Her. “You two certain- 
ly {narried at a ripe old age, 
didn’t you? Deep-freeze?" 
“Yes,” Myra admitted. 

He nodded. “Fascinating,” He 
said.- “No ill effects — either of 
you?” 

“We feel fine,” sKe told Him, 
and added. “TKe Cloverdon Re- 
search people gave me these fit- 
ness certificates. They examined 
both of us very thoroughly when 
we came round, a few weeks ago. 
They’re very interested to know 
how it will turn out.” 

“Understandably,” commented 
the doctor. “All right, I’ll for- 
ward your particulars to the Li- 
censing Office. I expect the ap- 
plication will rock them a bit, 
but in view of the Cloverdon peo- 
ple’s recommendation, they’re 
scarcely likely to refuse, 

“You’ll get your license by 


post. You present it at a chem- 
ist’s. Th'ey’11 give you a pill. 
Be sure to keep to the instruc- 
tions you’ll get with it. If it 
doesn’t work, you apply to me. 
I will issue you with a duplicate 
license, and you can try again. 
Is that quite clear?” 

“Perfectly,” said Cyra, and sat 
gazing blankly into space. 

“Something you don’t under- 
stand?” inquired the doctor. 

“No,” Cyra assured him. “No, 
it’s only — well, I’ve now been 
looking forward to this for a 
hundred and one years ...” 

At the door she paused, struck 
by a sudden thought, and looked 
back. 

“Doctor, if it should turn out 
to be twins — they do rather run 
in my family ■ — ?” 

The doctor smiled reassuring- 
ly. 

“They’ll be all right,” He as- 
sured her. “Birth's we can limit, 
but twins still come under Act of 
God.” 

Which, as it Happened, was 
just as well.

Since fhe Jinn knew they were superior to men , 
they were quite sure they had all the answers. 


'"pHe firm knock was shockingly 
loud in the deserted build- 
ing, and it jarred Professor Philip 
Morrison into dropping the blue 
pencil He Had been idly twirling 
while leaning back, lost in 
thought The heel resting on his 
ancient metal desk caught the 
loose center drawer and almost 
yanked it out as He Hastily sat 
erect. He managed to catch botE 
His balance and the drawer, but 
Had to grab the desktop for sup- 
port; his reflexes were not what 
they Had been, as a young man, 
when He Had worked His way to 
an undergraduate degree through 
a series of athletic scholarships. 

With his feet on the floor again, 
the teacher let irritation roughen 
his voice when he called for the 


unexpected visitor to enter. It 
was eleven at night, one hour be- 
fore the Kalf-century mark, and 
he was alone in his small second 
office just off the lab. He had 
Hardly expected a student to fer- 
ret Him out Here and had Hoped 
for an Hour in which to think 
about Merry. He and his only 
child Had been growing steadily 
apart since the death of Her moth- 
er two years ago, and He Had just 
received the disturbing news that 
she was not going to renew the 
preliminary one-year marital con- 
tract with Her second Husband. 
Both sHe and Roger had majored 
in political science and couldn’t 
even get along with each other. 
Those inexact disciplines some 
dreamers insisted were sciences

worked much better in theory 
than in practice. 

“Dr. Morrison?” the young 
man waiting politely in the door 
was oriental and unusually tall 
and thin. “My n&me is Tako Ta- 
ka ha shi, I am one of Professor 
Sloan’s postdoctoral students. I 
saw your light, and thought . 
sir, I have a project I wish to dis- 
cuss with you. Dr. Sloan said he 
didn’t care to hear about extra- 
curricular activities.” 

That was odd behavior even for 
crusty old Sloan. Morrison studi- 
ed His unwelcome visitor with 
more alert eyes and saw the slight 
but tell-tale parietal bulge, the 
High rise of vertical forehead. Ta- 
kaHaslu was a Jinni, which ex- 
plained why Ke couldn’t talk to 
His own mentor. The general con- 
troversy over the Jinn had died 
away after the genetics law final- 
ly became a reality in 2045, but 
the grouchy older teacher Had re- 
tained all His prejudices. He still 
believed that the original ten 
thousand young Genetically 
Evolved Newmen, whose improv- 
ed intelligence Had inspired the 
law, were plotting to replace Ho- 
mo sapiens, and not through con- 
trolled evolution. The idea was 
nonsense, . of course. That first 
large-scale experimental group 
Had been only sixteen years of 
age at the time, and scattered 
throughout the world’s major uni- 
versities. The law Had been passed 

133 


because normal people, himself 
fairly prominent among them, 
had worked hard for it. Sloan re- 
mained unconvinced. He had of 
necessity accepted them in His 
classroom, but agreed to work 
with two on postdoctoral projects 
only after a nasty fuss with the 
department head. This young 
man had obviously strayed from 
the agreed path and lost Sloan’s 
forced support. 

“This is, ah’, a little unusual, 
but if there’s something you're 
bursting to get out . .” Morrison 
smiled tolerantly and motioned 
TakaKashii to a chair. He sudden- 
ly realized he Had sounded fatu- 
ous and smug and regretted 
seeming that old and stolid. But 
you became inured to enthusiasm 
after the first hundred students 
who were almost exploding with 
it had shared their nebulous and 
impossibly exotic ideas about bi- 
ology with you. Even the Jinn He 
Had taught in the advanced class- 
es He still carried were subject 
to the infection. As a major re- 
searcher with a large government 
grant, he had for several years 
been spared the task of personal 
coaching and had lost contact 
with the Jinn students when the 
last of them attained His doctor- 
ate. 

“Sir, I believe you Have been 
working for several years on a 
method of converting cellulose to 
glucose, on a practical basis. I 

GALAXY 



think the report I want an au- 
thorization to publish will interest 
you. It deals with’ the same prob- 
lem.” 

M orrison felt a stir of interest. 

His work had not been pub- 
licized, and he always asked' his 
student helpers not to talk outside 
the lab. It was hard to keep the 
general nature of his researches 
quiet, though 1 . 

“Yes, I’d be interested in hear- 
ing about your project, Taka- 
Eashi,” he admitted cautiously. 
“I have to be at the student circle 
for the New Year’s rally at 
; twelve, however.” He did not add 
that he was looking forward to 
joining in his heavy baritone on 
the old school songs, or that he 
had volunteered to monitor the 
event rather than sit home alone 
in an empty house. 

“Yes sir. This will require only 
a few minutes of your time.” Ta- 
kahashi slipped smoothly into fa- 
speech and Morrison found him- 
self straining to follow the words, 
despite all the proof that mean- 
ing could be best absorbed by re- 
laxing. The young man’s word 
choice was excellent, and his ton- 
gue moved with impressive speed. 
“Heard you took a chemical ap-

cose macromoleculcs I found — ” 
“Just a moment!" Morrison 
broke in sharply, fully attentive 
now. “In the first place I am not 
‘trying’ to produce glucose from 
cellulose; I have done so. The 
problem is one of production 
practicality.” He hesitated, know- 
ing he was hedging. The process 
he had labored twenty years to 
perfect worked, yes, but mass 
production was impossibly expen- 
sive. He had seen his dream of a 
great new food supply for a dan- 
gerously overpopulated world 
grind its way downward to slow 
extinction, dying beneath the in- 
evitable logic of the engineer’s 
slide rule and the accountant’s 
pencil. They had called his pro- 
cess a laboratory toy, and at sev- 
enty, with' only ten or fifteen pro- 
ductive years still ahead, He Had 
found himself psychologically un- 
able to start a new project. He 
was accredited with several small 
but worthwhile discoveries made

ment of his professional life. Hf 
had been tinkering with the basic 
operation for over a year now, 
with no true improvement in ef- 
ficiency. “In the second instance, 
I considered your approach and 
discarded it. The complexity of

cult. I’m afraid you are wasting 
your time.” 

“Sir I finished work and believe

me explain?” 

Morrison leaned back and stud- 
ied the younger man’s face with 
growing anger. He Had dealt be- 
fore with the overpolite arrogance 
of Jinn students, tfieir disconcert- 
ing Habit of being always two 
jumps ahead of the instructor, but 
this was the first time He had 
discussed his own project witK 
one. This young man’s statement 
was incredible, and His patent as- 
sumption of his own correctness 
infuriating. And yet if he were 
right — if those four extra ounces 
of association neurones program- 
• med into his forebrain by genetic 
manipulation Had actually en- 
abled Him to come up with' an an- 
swer — the discovery was of im- 
mense importance. Too much’ of 
overcrowded Earth’s resources 
were tied up in simply feeding its 
burdensome human population. 
With' an average life expectancy 
of a hundred-and-ten, and the 
biological need for children as 
strong as ever, the Malthusian 
doctrine seemed proven beyond 
contradiction. Population always 
outran food supply.

earnestly, and Morrison became 
interested despite his skepticism. 
This young man was part of the 
most ambitious experiment ever 
attempted in human genetics, and 
he and his fellows represented 
mankind’s first attempt to move 
on to a higher evolutionary pla- 
teau in less than a million years. 
Brain size alone did not guaran- 
tee superiority, but like all mem- 
bers of that first massive appli- 
cation group, he Had from pain- 
less Caesarian birth received the 
most mentally and physically 
stimulating training transactional 
psychology could provide. His 
first baby rattle had been replac- 
ed with a more complex one the 
moment He had seen, touched and 
tasted it into familiarity, and his 
tenth one featured colored lights 
that blinked in intricate series 
when inset buttons were pushed 
in simple patterns. He had a posi- 
tive identity before he was one 
year old and could think in sym- 
bols by two. At three he could 
read, and his childhood games 
were designed to develop his 
growing body evenly. At four he

was learning the basic mathemat- 
ical theorems, and thereafter he 
followed the established educa- 
tional channels, except that the 
normal pabulum ladled out to 
children was omitted and He mov- 
ed at a very fast pace. He 
Had completed all undergraduate 
work by fifteen or sixteen. Most 
of the Jinn Had tlieir first doctor- 
ates by eighteen. Many of them 
had gone on into industry, gov- 
ernment or teaching, where they 
could practice their specialties. 
A few, like TakaHashi, lingered 
on as students, working in areas 
that interested them. There was 
no doubting their innate and 
achieved superiority. 

A lot of older people, like 
Sloan, were unable to accept the 
advent of Homo superior grace- 
fully and still fought the idea 
that all licensed pregnancies 
should be by genetically improv- 
ed sperms. They Had lost the 
legal battle five years back, but 
unauthorized normal births were 
a world-wide plague. Since New- 
men bred true only with each 
other, and a union with Homo 
Sapiens produced idiots, the so- 
called normals were on their way 
to becoming a minority. And the 
true shame of it, Morrison 
thought bitterly, was that the an- 
tagonism of the old for the new 
was so unnecessary. It was the 
developmental stimulation as 
much as the increased brain size 

JINN 


which produced the superior be- 
ing, and it was physically impos- 
sible to provide intensive train- 
ing to all babies. Without it, Jinn 
intelligence was only an easily 
acceptable notch above the aver- 
age. And of course the stimula- 
tion techniques were available to 
any parents willing to spend that 
much t im e with their child, 
whether New or normal. 

“Won’t bore details work,” the 
young Newman went on. “Ap-

Ti yfomson realized he was lean- 
ing tensely forward across 
his desk, objections running 
through his mind in a confused 
stream. But if it were true . 
He raised a Hand and ticked off 
the most obvious points. “Taka- 
hashi. I’ll believe your incredible 
Statement when you explain, first, 
how you confine the bacterial col- 

141 



ony to one section of the small 
intestine; second, how the body 
survives their poisonous wastes; 
tHird, Bow tEe colony growth is 
regulated, fourth — never mind, 
I could go on all night. Just ac- 
count for tBose three for me. And 
speak regular; I want to think.” 
“Yes girl” Takahashi ignored 
his lame excuse for avoiding fa- 
speecfi and accepted the chal- 
lenge with an eagerness that 
amazed Morrison. There Had to 
be something wrong Here, but 
still . “I’ve built a Highly selec- 
tive pH factor into my protozoa, 
giving them a very narrow ac- 
ceptable range. The jejunum kills 
them by its Higher acidity, and 
the colon by its alkali content. 
You will recall that the ileum 
is very close to neutral. If excess 
protozoa are dispersed into the 
bloodstream — and this is the 
method by which a colony regu- 
lates its size, which answers your 
third question — the body’s pha- 
gocytes absorb them without dif- 
ficulty. As for organic poisons 
from their wastes, sir, they are 
carried to the liver and detoxified 
in the same way by die kidneys. 
There are no ill effects.” 

The answers were too direct, to 
sure to be disbelieved. Morrison 
found that he was convinced in 
spite of his astonishment, and 
knew that if he raised more ob- 
jections they would be countered 
with the same easy certainty. 

142 


So it was done. The project to 
which He had dedicated the better 
part of his professional life was 
complete, and the credit would go 
to an artificially mutated young 
man less than a third his age. He 
felt slightly numbed, as though 
from shock, and through the 
numbness a slowly gathering an- 
ger at the unfairness, the injustice 
of being beaten by a Jinni, This 
tall, thin man seemed so terribly 
young; it was frightening to see 
such brilliance and technical abil- 
ity in a man just turned twenty- 
one. 

Experimental genetic program- 
ming on humans had begun in 
1980, the year of Morrison’s birth, 
and persisted through a succes- 
sion of horrors until the first suc- 
cessful enlarged brain appeared in 
2010. A delay of just thirty years 
and He could Have been one of the 
predecessors of the group repre- 
sented by Takahashi. The special 
importance of these young men 
and women was the proof they 
offered that genetic manipulation 
worked for everyone, that the en- 
tire Human race could be up- 
graded in a few generations. When 
a Jinni’s increased learning ca- 
pacity was developed to its max- 
imum by stimulation training, he 
automatically became a genius by 
the old standards. There were now 
ten thousand such young geniuses 
in the world, in addition to the 
earlier individual successes, and 

GALAXY 



one of them had decided to ac- 
complish the task Morrison had 
been unable to perform. 

THe world urgently needed Ta- 
kaKasfii’s discovery. A human 
would still require protein and 
lipids for a balanced diet, but the 
poor of all nations, who lived pri- 
marily off vegetables, would eat 
well at last A head of lettuce 
would provide a man with a day's 
food, from what was now mostly 
bulk. Fallen leaves could be 
ground, flavored until they be- 
came acceptable to human taste 
buds, and eaten. Vast new indus- 
tries would appear, devoted to 
the task of preparing tasty pro- 
ducts from cellulose and persuad- 
ing people to eat them. Grass 
would soon be consumed direct, 
instead of wastefully second-hand 
in the form of steak. Or the basic 
process could be adapted to ani- 
mals, enriching their diet so much 
that the price could be cut in half, 
bringing protein into Hovels where 
it was seldom seen. The possibil- 
ities and ramifications were end- 
less. The new food source was so 
great that all of Earth’s billions 
could be fed for the next Hundred 
years, until their proliferation ab- 
sorbed even the new resources. 

*The door opened without warn- 
ing, and a rather large blond 
man entered and shut it quietly 
behind him. There was a dartgun 
in his hand. 


Morrison jerked erect in out’ 
raged astonishment, and the bar- 
rel swung to point unwaveringly; 
at his chest. “Sit down please, Dr. : 
Morrison I This is a disassociation 
anesthetic and paralyzes instant- 
ly." THe newcomer’s voice was 
low and without menace, but if 
was obvious he meant what fie 
said. Morrison sank slowly back, 
wondering if "he could hit his in- 
tercom quickly enough to yell for 
Kelp. And then He saw the broad 
sweep of the big man’s forehead, 
and gave up the idea. He was 
dealing with 1 another Jinni; the 
drug would work as He had stated. 

Morrison retreated into dig- 
nity. “Just what is the meaning 
of this?” He asked, in tones as 
frosty as fie could muster. 

“I’m Wilfred Ebert, sir, and I 
regret that the very interesting 
conversation you Have just Had 
with my colleague made it man- 
datory for me to appear. I’m 
afraid that it must be erased from 
your memory.” 

“Bill, I’ve told you I am going 
to publish!” Takahashi said an- 
grily. “Just how far are you pre- 
pared to go to stop me? And how 
did you know I was Here?” 

“As far as necessary,” Ebert 
answered cheerfully. “As for 
knowing you were talking to Dr. 
Morrison, don’t work up a per- 
secution complex about it We’ve 
had a sound-activated recorder 
covering his working office here 

143 


JINN 



for months, just in case he per- 
formed a miracle and came up 
with a practical production meth- 
od on His process. I saw tKe unit 
recording when I came to change 
the tape and* listened in on the 
headset. I’m sorry, Tako, but you 
can’t do it. The council has up- 
held my ruling unanimously.” 

“I don’t recognize the authority 
of the Newmen council,” said 
Takahashi tightly. “Five billion 
people go to bed Hungry every 
night. Who are the Newmen to 
tell me I can’t feed them?” 
“Tako, I know how you feel, 
but you’re being melodramatic. 
Hungry they may be, but they 
aren’t starving, and as long as the 
American plains and Russian 
steppes pour out the food, it’s 
unlikely they will. As for the au- 
thority bit — listen, you were 
told that Carl Campbelleton has 
produced the basic equations for 
a semi-closed propulsion system 
that brings the stars within our 
reach. Can’t you see what this 
means? Development costs are 
going to be prohibitive, and our 
watchdog team’s analysis of the 
U.N. indicates a clear majority 
for acceptance only if it Is pre- 
sented as a desperation measure. 
If you relieve the pressure by 
opening up this new food source 
. He shrugged eloquently. 
“Within our lifetimes we’d be 
back to where we are now. The 
reproduction syndrome is inerad- 
144 


icable — even Newmen will have 
children I — and unless you want 
to deliberately return the lifespan 
to the old level we Have no choice 
but to colonize, on the same mas- 
sive scale that kept the European 
population at an acceptable 
growth rate while America was 
opening up. You know these facts 
as well as I. Why argue with 
them?” 

"AyTorrison listened to Ebert’s 
ca j m> self-assured voice in 
growing amazement. A Newmen 
council that claimed authority 
over all Jinn, his own office bug- 
ged, even a watchdog team whose 
obvious function was to analyze 
Important issues coming before 
the U.N. and predict the vote. So 
the wild stories He Had laugfied 
away were true after all! THe 
world was being controlled by the 
big brains, and these two stub- 
born men were arguing the course 
twenty billion Human beings 
would take for the next Hundred 
years. Suddenly His own troubles 
seemed unimportant, almost triv- 
ial. Even Takahashi’s discovery 
faded before the blinding impli- 
cations of this new knowledge. 

Morrison found Himself shak- 
ing his Head in mute protest. He 
felt as though His personal world, 
already crumbling, Had been com- 
pletely shattered. Suddenly He 
seemed old, tired, ready for His 
part to yield the Earth to these 

GALAXY 



brilliant demi-gods who were so 
blandly certain of tHe wortH of 
tKeir own ideas. Only tHe young 
could believe in tfiemselves so to- 
tally, be so ready to act on tlieir 
own assumptions. Even tHe two 
rather obvious fallacies Ebert Had 
stated as facts a moment ago 
seemed almost acceptable. 

Morrison raised His gaze, to 
find Ebert staring at Him sympa- 
thetically. THe blond man Had 
lowered tHe dartgun, but it was 
still ready for instant action. TKe 
teacher straightened up and said, 
“Just a moment. If you don't 
mind explanations comprehensi- 
ble to my under-developed brain 
I Have a question or two.” TKe 
sarcasm was ignored, and Ebert 
politely gave Morrison His undi- 
vided attention. “History teaches 
that all attempts at population 
control by colonization were ef- 
fective only on the short term. As 
for star travel, Einstein's equa- 
tions Have been proven time and 
again. Just what makes you so 
certain your grandiose ideas will 
work?” 

Ebert smiled. “We act on fiigH 
probability, sir, not certainty. The 
probability is very high that Ein- 
stein can be modified, just as he 
modified Newton without dis- 
proving his basic laws. I’m a 
psychologist, not a physicist, but 
the basic idea is that Einstein’s 
equations do not apply to a unit 
of matter with a self-contained 


propulsion system. As for the col- 
onization-population history, I 
must disagree with you. Coloni- 
zation relieves population when 
there is a place to go and an 
economical means of transport. 
Its benefits were short-term on 
Earth because we ran out of 
room. But frankly, we Newmen 
would favor pushing on to the 
Stars regardless. We feel that con- 
stant challenge is necessary for 
growth." 

“And since the future belongs 
to you, you are now deciding it?" 

T? belt’s friendly, relaxed expres- 
' sion faded into a chilly aloof- 
ness. “Dr. Morrison, I would have 
expected you to be above the 
rnan-versus-mutant nonsense. We 
are fully Human, perhaps more so 
tKan you, since it's primarily the 
forebrain and cultural condition- 
ing that distinguishes man from 
the other animals. And we are 
fully aware that ten thousand 
people, no matter how intelligent, 
cannot actively control the lives 
of twenty billion. What we can 
do is identify the important turn- 
ing points which’ determine the 
direction an entire society will 
take and attempt to influence 
the outcome of those selected 
events. Tako’s discovery is one 
such point, and Carl Campbelle- 
ton’s another. If a Newman had 
been in Russia when the Bolshe- 
viks were preparing to overthrow 

145 


JINN 



Kerensky’s government . Eb- 
ert shook His Bead ruefully. “You 
were a staunch supporter of tHe 
genetics law five years ago, Dr. 
Morrison. Nothing Has changed 
since then.” 

“Yes, it Has. Nd one was Hold- 
ing a dartgun on my cfiest then,” 
Morrison answered quietly. “May 
I ask How many turning points 
you Have influenced so far?” 

“This is tHe first,” Ebert ad- 
mitted soberly. “Getting the mon- 
ey appropriate to finance Carl 
will be the second. THe third will 
be an effort by Brasilia to with- 
draw from the U.N., taking most 
of South America with Her. This 
will occur in about four months, 
and we Have already started tHe 
campaign which will bring down 
the present government when the 
attempt is made. Our forecast 
calls for about three major events 
a year for the forseeable future.” 

Morrison leaned forward and 
looked up at Ebert. The tall man 
met his gaze squarely. “Young 
man, I think that in your anxiety 
to control Earth’s resources 
you’ve forgotten one of the oldest 
dictums of aU: You cannot sup- 
press knowledge! If Takahasjii 
does not publish, someone else 
will redo His work, and it will in- 
evitably see print And you Have 
no right to deprive living humans 
of food in order to benefit theo- 
retically a society of the future. 
You say you are a psychologist; 

146 


just How much of your desire to 
manipulate the world is traceable 
to a simple old-fashioned power 
complex?” 

“I Hope none,” Ebert said 
quickly. “Our decisions are not 
taken lightly, sir.” 

((T doubt your wisdom, not 
your sincerity,” Morrison’s 
tone was dry. “And I don’t think 
you know what wisdom is, or ap- 
preciate its value. The primary 
ingredient is a quality you don’t 
possess, called experience.” He 
shifted back in his chair, drop- 
ping His hands to His lap and 
glancing quickly at Ebert’s gun, 
still pointing to the floor. “Your 
superior intelligence and intensive 
training haven’t produced an un- 
derstanding of man as good as 
my own.” He moved forward 
again, planting his feet firmly ort 
the floor and resting his Bands on 
His knees. “If I thought you 
would believe me, I’d point out 
that a person your age is always 
certain of His own opinions, no 
matter How worthless, and per- 
fectly willing to inflict them on 
others. And the truth is that all 
ten thousand of you can combine 
your bright young intelligences 
and still come up with the wrong 
answer. You haven’t convinced 
me.” 

“I didn’t expect to, sir. But one

coveries in my own field is a new

“I regret it too,” said Morrison 
and yanked tfie loose center desk

ing it vertical and springing to 
his feet as fie fiurled its jumbled 
papers, clips and pens at Ebert’s

dealy He saw the good, fulfilling 
work with which he could occupy 
himself for his remaining active 
years. He Had enjoyed lobbying 
for the passage of the genetics 
law. He could retire from teach- 
ing and devote himself to prov- 
ing the watchdog team wrong. 
And he would not be alone. Mer- 
ry’s only application of Her poli- 
tical training had been in working 
with him during that Hectic cam- 
paign in 2045. What she and hus- 
band Roger really needed was a 
worthwhile cause, a challenge in 
which they could lose themselves. 
He would shortly present them 
with one. 

He realized, as he came to a 
puffing stop beside the wide-eyed 
guard's monitor set, that the New- 
men's council would Have to be 
broken up quietly, the members 
dispersed without fanfare. A 
witch hunt would be fatal, both to 
them and the upgrading of hu- 
manity they represented. And yet 
they had to be brought under 
control, their young eagerness for 
results subordinated to the good 
of mankind as a whole. If their 
overly ambitious scheme to in- 


fluence the world was allowed to 
continue, an explosion was inev- 
itable. He had just demonstrated, 
by a brief application of old-fash- 
ioned force, that any real mani- 
pulation of mankind was almost 
impossible. The Jinn would have 
discovered this Hard lesson for 
themselves after their first few 
efforts failed, but if their med- 
dling became known they might 
not live to rue the consequences. 

“One of my students,” he gasp- 
ed to the guard, and saw him 
reaching for the alert button. 
“Nervous breakdown, in my of- 
fice. He has a dartgun. Don’t 
harm him.” 

Green lights began to blink on 
the console as guards reported in. 
Morrison, still breathing heavily, 
turned to Takahashi, silently 
waiting. It was done, and out of 
his Hands for the moment. He had 
helped to make his old dream of 
a well-fed humanity a reality af- 
ter all, though hardly in the man- 
ner he had expected. 

Man could reach for the stars 
with' a full belly.

yet to hear anybody say a seri- 
ously bad word about Larry Niv- 
en’s writing. THere was a time, of 
course, when one wouldn’t expect 
to. Bob Heinlein was motivating 
people in about the same way 
Niven does; Eric Frank Russell 
was plotting in much the same 


149 



sort of pattern; Hal Clement 
was rationalizing his settings 
about as impressively as Niven 
does, a little more so, maybe; 
maybe a little differently, ratfi- 
er, and William. Term had the 
same sort of trick with deadpan 
declarative sentences that turn 
out to have been time bombs. 
Niven fits right into that tra- 
dition; He ought to have Happen- 
ed right about the same time 
Tenn did, and we could Have said 
the two of them represented the 
two faces of the same ricH coin. 

Instead, he has come along 
now, when, the trend is all against 
his land of writing, and becomes 
an award-winner, a much ad- 
mired man, and an all-’round 
good fellow. I don’t understand 
it. He must be very good. 

He is. He really is, and I take 
him fondly to my doctrine that 
trends are for second-raters. 
Quality rises above fashion. For 
examples of wKat I mean, please 
— please — see a copy of Neu- 
tron Star (Ballantine), a collec- 
tion of eight of his stories. 

Several of these are about Beo- 
wulf Shaeffer, former chief pilot 
for Nakamura Lines, wlio I sus- 
pect might look a little bit like 
Cary Grant in the Korda Gunga 
Din, except that He's an albino. 
(Niven, as noted previously, does 
not so much delineate a character 
as he does describe His reflexes). 
Sh'aeffer is a kind of wonderful 


adventurer, doing the most aston- 
ishing things for the most inno- 
cent reasons. He does them in a 
dynamic, well-populated uni- 
verse, and Niven rounds out this 
not inconsiderable achievement 
by also Having the audacity to 
make His problems physical ones. 
Simple ones, at that, though tHeir 
solutions are often based on ex- 
tremely complicated ingenuities. 

By doing so, He creates a won- 
derful effect. He makes you real- 
ize that it would be a tragedy if 
Sh'aeffer lost His life . only 
that, and nothing more. This not 
only makes for exciting stories, it 
does quite a bit for the general 
dignity of Man. 

Niven’s universe — our uni- 
verse — is, as I’ve said, dynamic. 
It has color, motion and a cen- 
tral explosion that Has already 
happened and will blow the whole 
thing out of existence in another 
20,000 years. That’s a safe dis- 
tance in time, of course, for you 
and me, and even Shaeffer, but on 
the other Hand, Niven’s scale of 
time starts back in the days of the 
Slaver empire, millions of years 
ago, so you can see we’re at the 
short end of the beam. It does 
tend to make you hang tight. 

And it’s well populated. Not 
only by us, but our variant de- 
scendants among the stars and 
by fragmentary living relics of 
the Slavers’ sway, but also by 
such people as the Puppeteers,

with their two h'eadedness and 
their beautiful voices, their cow- 
ardice, and their mercantile sense. 

It’s lovely stuff. It really Is. 
“Neutron Star,” the prizewinning 
short story from It from which 
the collection takes its name, is 
in itself worth the paperback 
price of admission, as is the great, 
ebullient feeling you’ll get. 

There was a time of course, 
when all the stories by everybody 
were always simple. Well, things 
in general were considered sim- 
pler; there really was a time, you 
know, when people Honestly told 
themselves that O. Henry solu- 
tions were real solutions, when 
! responsibility was considered suf- 
ficiently met, when the proper at- 
titude was struck and when ev- 
erything had its defined place. 
(That was in your parents, and 
schoolteachers’ time; not yours 
and mine.) In that time and in 
that place, which covered the 
civilized (i.e., English- speaking) 
f portion of the globe, it was only 
{ reasonable to assume that the 
I transformation of things was the 
■ transformation of natures. Thus 
a vast preoccupation, favorable 
and otherwise, with technology 
and the physical sciences. Thus, 
science-fiction, in its time. 

Science Fiction by Gaslight, to 
be exact, as anthologized in an 
aptly named book edited (but 
not named) by Sam Moskowitz, 


and published at $6.95 by World. 
Subtitled “A History and Anthol- 
ogy of Science Fiction in the 
Popular Magazines, 1891-1911,” 
this book is full of stories about, 
for example, the destruction of 
London by lava, of Manhattan 
by tilting, of the world by the 
glare of light finally arriving from 
the immense central sun ’round 
which revolves the galaxy. (AH, 
there, L.N.;) It also contains 
stories about bluff, and Heroic 
deed, in future wars. It has two 
scientifically detected murders, 
one grim and one funny tale 
about man-eating plants, and a 
flock of other words which are 
not science fiction as most of us 
would understand it, nor, in fact, 
are truly resolved stories, but 
which, now that I recollect the 
mood, certainly represented an 
accepted popular storytelling 
mode even as late as my late 
childhood. (Some of the other 
words group up into some very 
worthy stories, but we Haven’t 
yet gotten to that.) 

A book such as this gives one 
to pause. For one thing, if one is 
in the ephemera racket oneself, 
any collection from popular pe- 
riodicals gives you the shivers. 
Collect 80 or a hundred thousand 
words from the general magazines 
of any era, and you achieve the 
paradoxical feat of making frothi- 
ness more apparent in direct re- 
lationship to the weight of it you

pile on. This stuff depends for 
most of its effects on popular 
prejudice. OK, I don’t mean big 
things, like the racism in Bur- 
roughs, or the casual blunder- 
ings upon it tKat you’ll find in 
these stories. I mean the little 
things — like the “shorthand” 
of which we sf people are so 
proud, for example — that make 
a prose divertissement go smooth- 
ly- 

People bitch about the lack of 
characterization and motivation 
in commercial writing; they miss 
the fact that it’s there ih predi- 
gested form, or if not the fact 
itself, then its inevitable conse- 
quences. In order to Kit fast with 
it, get it done and get out, you 
and the reader both simplify. 

In the days of this book, you 
h’ad to admit that all cops were 
Irish, all Irish cops were im- 
mensely strong, faithful, and 
slightly stupid, for instance. 
Okay; this was a popular preju- 
dice of the day. But in fact, any- 
one intelligent enough had to have 
noticed that not all live cops fit 
this description. So the accept- 
ance of the innumerable Paddys 
and Sergeant O’Tooles in this 
form of froth was based on a two- 
step phenomenon, rather than on 
simple suspension of disbelief. It 
was based on “I know better, but 
it’s a minor matter and for enter- 
tainment’s sake I’ll go along with 
their belief.” Okay, for entertain- 


ment’s sake people have gone 
along with a lot worse than that. 
But implicit in this blithe sur- 
render is an acknowledgment, 
right there at the heart of the 
process, that the process is of no 
consequence. 

It is to be hoped, of course, 
that today’s science fiction, or at 
least that part of today’s science 
fiction, which 1 appeals in its own 
magazines and is produced by 
thoroughly conscious craftsmen 
heavily involved with true prob- 
lems, is not going to stand re- 
vealed in the same light as are 
these stories from the popular 
press of their day. Or it is to be 
hoped that Sam’s taste simply 
ran to the froth, and that side by 
side with this material there ap- 
peared that great fraction which 
is cracked out by Sturgeon’s Law, 
but was lost to Moskowitz’s. At 
any rate, something is to be hoped 
for. Very hard. 

Despite all this, there are sto- 
ries in the book •which are not 
merely good — pick over twenty 
years’ worth of hitherto untouch- 
ed matter, and you Had better 
produce a number of “good” sto- 
ries — but effective. “The Doom 
of London” is one of them, per- 
haps because it isn’t really about 
the doom of London but about 
flight from disaster; “The Mon- 
ster of Lake LaMetrie” is an- 
other, though it might have bgen 
better had the author chosen to

develop the events of his story 
even if it is a jest; “An Experi- 
ment in Gyro Hats” is as funny 
as ever it must Have been, not be- 
cause it obeyed a trend toward 
funny inventor stories but be- 
cause it’s by Ellis Parker Butler, 
th’e man wKo wrote “Pigs is Pigs.” 
More familiar stories are “Tfie 
Voice in the NigEt” and “TEe 
Land Ironclads,” which I suspect 
are familiar because Hodgson 
and Wells were top-rate talent. 
But then there’s "An Express of 
the Future,” too fragmentary and 
frail even to serve as yet another 
example for my assertion that 
Jules Verne is a pretty brittle fa- 
cade to lean mucH worship on. 

It’s a thought-provoking book, 
is what it is, and as usual with 
Moskowitz, a must for the seri- 
ous collector and historian who, 
if he is really serious, will find his 
own clues for where He might 
second-guess Sam’s judgments. 
One, and only one, will I take is- 
sue with here, that being his claim 
that Wells described the caterpil- 
lar treads of the tank before the 
tank was ever invented. 

The relevant passage reads 
"... feet. They were thick, stum- 
py, feet, between knobs and but- 
tons in shape — flat, broad 
things, reminding one of the feet 
of elephants or the legs of cater- 
pillars.” (Italics Wells’s.) Only 
by taking the less likely meaning 
of “between,” and then by fall- 


ing victim to the Caterpillar 
Tractor Company’s publicity im- 
age, can you assume, as Sam 
does in quoting this same passage, 
that Wells had anything in mind 
but a device that proceeded over 
uneven terrain in the manner of 
some of the Moon-walker gad- 
gets that are being designed to- 
day. Wells did indeed postulate 
the use of armored vehicles in 
combat — as Verne did the use 
of submarines — and as Da Vinci 
had seriously suggested some 
years before either of them. But 
just as Verne failed to provide 
the Nautilus with a periscope, so 
Wells did not give his ironclads 
the endless belt, and let us not, for 
God’s sake, start another one 
of those apocrypha there, then. 

We know too much about each 
other, and not enough about our- 
selves. We bicker, we broil, and 
we don’t always — we hardly ev- 
er — know what it’s about. Us sf 
types, that is. Take the strange 
case of Robert Silverberg. 

Silverb'erg Has written more 
books than most people have 
notes to their milkman. Literally. 
He is comfortably in funds as 
the result of commercial writing, 
an almost unheard-of phenome- 
non. Rich’, yes. People get rich

Welch at one of Hugh Hefner’s 
parties. But hardly anyone makes 
a decent living at it, treating it 
the way someone else would treat 
a nice little brokerage House or 
architect’s office.; Most people 
starve and cripple themselves at 
it. 

The way to do it is to sit down 
at the typewriter every morning, 
write for ten thousand words, and 
stand up for the rest of the day. 
That produces one book a week. 
Can you possibly have that many 
ideas, and even if you got them, 
could you develop them in any 
noteworthy way? Answer: Prob- 
ably not. But you are a fool if 
you are in business and you let 
something like that deter you. 

The clarity of mind, the single- 
ness of purpose, the sheer manag- 
erial skill reflected in Silverberg’s 
early career are qualities many of 
us ought to have studied. There 
is something there for each of us 
to learn from. But instead most of 
us, living in each other’s hip pock- 
ets as we do, battered and brow- 
beat at Silverberg incessantly, 
taking him to task for being shal- 
low, and then going Home and 
writing painfully. Most of us Had 
nobler aspirations and burned 
with a hotter flame than Silver- 
berg apparently did. We were so 
intense, as a matter of fact, that 
our hang-ups distorted our copy. 
Jobs were rushed by financial 
pressure. Choices of characteri- 


zation, exposition and setting were 
dictated by hunger, or fear . but 
our product was nevertheless bet- 
ter than his, because while it was 
often no more efficient as story- 
telling than His was, ours Had 
Higher motives. 

Well, I’m citing extreme views 
of the old conflict between the 
Muse and the buck, and it wasn’t 
as intense as all that, but How 
curious to see that Silverberg is 
now writing deeply detailed, high- 
ly educated, beautifully figured 
books like Thorns, or like his lat- 
est from Ballantine, The Masks 
of Time. Did He plan to become 
this way all along, or did we per- 
suade him? And to what degree, 
then, does his very existence in 
this incarnation comment on us, 
or on him, or on our mutual past, 
or the future? 

Let’s not get too lost — The 
Masks of Time is not a wholly 
good book. It’s marred by several 
gratuitous problems, one being a 
sub-plot that skews the pacing, 
another being an inexplicable pru- 
rience that serves no visible plot- 
purpose. But its defects are the 
opposite of those Silverberg’s 
work used to have. It’s over- 
worked, and it dawdles. It’s 
crowded with’ people to whom too 
much attention has been paid, 
with incidents that could easily 
have been left out. This is very 
much' like what you’d expect from 
a Silverberg looking up over his 


154 


GALAXY 



shioulder and saying: (Here. Here. 
I’m an artist. See — Here’s a piece 
of evidence to prove it. And an- 
other. And another. And . ) But 
Silverberg has never betrayed the 
slightest trace of giving a damn 
what anybody said or thought. So 
jnaybe he was planning it this 
way all along. Maybe in the old 
days he’d whisper to a character: 
(All right I’m making you out of 
cardboard, but what I’ve omitted 
I’m going to pack into somebody 
else, some day, and he won’t just 
be round, he’ll be dense!" And 
slopping out an idiot plot, but 
promising himself that one of 
these days, all those clipped-off 
loose ends would be woven into 
a tapestry worthy of Bokhara. Or 
maybe Herculaneum. Who 
knows? We don’t really know 
each other any better than we 
know ourselves. 

But there it is. The new com- 
plete reversal . the hand emerg- 
ing from the mirror. 

OK, yes. The Masks of Time is 


about an enigmatic, bland, mis- 
chievous, self-assured fellow who 
emerges into public view one day 
in the very last days of the Twen- 
tieth century and claims to Have 
traveled back in time from the 
last days of the thirtieth. He up- 
sets everyone because he cannot 
or will not tell them anything 
about himself. All anyone can do 
is follow Kim around and observe, 
occasionally acceding to his wish- 
es, which frequently involve 
screwing up whatever machine or 
institution is complicated and as- 
sertedly smooth-running. In some 
ways like a better-rounded but 
less charismatic Stranger in a 
Strange Land, it is by the way 
the first of what will doubtless be 
many books to exploit the fact 
that we’re approaching another 
millenium and another inevitable 
outburst of apocalyptic hysteria. 

It’s not a wholly good book. 
But go buy it. It’s quite interest-

SPYING 

SEASON 


by MACK REYNOLDS 


Illustrated by BRAND 


Someone wanted a spy inside Eastern 
Europe — but wouldn't tell him why I 


I wearily, even as be checked a re- 

port on the screen of His desk 
T)aul Kosloff the 2nd said, teevee phone. He said, “Mr. Kos-

The older man looked at Him Paul Kosloff was a young man 


156 



of possibly thirty, well built and 
straight of carriage but, except 
for Slavic blueness of eye and 
blondness of Hair, not especially 
outstanding so far as face was 
concerned, save for a certain 
quiet dignity. His smile was slow, 
and there was a vulnerable some- 
thing there, a sincerity continual- 
ly striving to come through. 

He said now, “Don’t misunder- 
stand, Mr. Banning. I am not a 
draft dodger. The thing is, I am 
already employed, and at govern- 
ment work at that. I teach lan- 
guage on the Tri-Vision Univer- 
sity of the Air.” 

Herman Banning nodded. “Un- 
doubtedly that’s one of the rea- 
sons you were selected, Mr. Kos- 
loff. You make a common mis- 
take. The Bureau of Labor Draft 
doesn’t exist simply to find jobs 
for the unemployed, but to find 
the most suitable personnel for 
such positions as still remain un- 
der People’s Capitalism, the Ul- 
tra-welfare State." He frowned 
slightly. “Admittedly, this re- 
quest is a bit unusual. And, 
frankly, I don’t know what your 
assignment might be. However, 
the computers picked you out of 
the files.” 

Paul Kosloff said unhappily, 
“But I like my work. My pay 
is ample and — ” 

Banning was checking his 
jscreen again. “That’s one thin g 
to the good, Mr. Kosloff. The Bu- 

SPYING SEASON 


reau of Labor Draft seldom 
switches a man from one cate- 
gory to another without his pay 
being increased. I note that at 
present you receive four shares of 
Variable Basic a year to add to 
your portfolio. Undoubtedly, your 
pay at the Octagon will be at least 
another share a year.” 

“The Octagon?” Paul Kosloff 
said in disgust. “I didn’t even 
know it still existed.” 

“It still exists,” Herman Ban- 
ning said. He held out a paper. 
“Please report to Harry Kank, of 
the Inter-American Bureau of In- 
vestigation, at this office.” 

P aul Kosloff said, “There must 
be a mistake. I already Have 
a job and am perfectly satisfied 
with it.” 

He Had made his way by vac- 
uum-tube transport to the office 
of the Octagon in Greater Wash- 
ington and was now confronted 
by a cold-eyed civilian in late 
middle age who carried himself 
as though backed by long years 
in the military. There was a no- 
nonsense aura about him. 

The other held a hand over his 
desk to shake Kosloff’s and said, 
“Sit down, Paul.” 

Paul Kosloff sat down and 
frowned. He was younger than 
tliis one, but still a full professor. 
He was seldom called by his first 
name by strangers. 

The other said, “My name is 

157 



Harry Kank. Many years ago, 
when I was younger than you are 
now, I accompanied your father 
on an assignment in what is now 
Common Eur-Asia, Belgrade to 
be exact. The jqb was to smuggle 
Milovan Djilas out of Yugo- 
slavia.” 

Paul Kosloff said, “He never 
told me about that one.” 

“It didn’t come off. Djilas 
wouldn’t leave. He told us his 
job was in Yugoslavia.” 

Paul Kosloff said, “Look here, 
it’s nice to meet a friend of my 
father’s from the old days, but — ” 
Harry Kank said evenly, “I did 
not say I was a friend of your fa- 
other’s, Paul. I said I was an asso- 
ciate. Your father didn’t have 
many friends. He was too dedi- 
cated, too fanatical, if you will. 
We used to call him the Cold 
War’s Lawrence of Arabia. I’ve 
often suspected that it came as a 
great blow to Him when the Cold 
War finally faded away.” 
Kosloff was slightly taken 
aback. “Well, be that as it may, 
I still Haven’t the vaguest idea 
why I’m Here. I know nothing 
about my father’s work.” 

“This Has nothing to do with 
your father. It’s only a coinci- 
dence that you’re Paul Kosloff 
the 2nd. Harry Kank looked 
down into his desk screen. “The 
computers pulled you for the fol- 
lowing reasons. You speak all of 
the Balkan languages, including 

158 


even Hungarian. You have fairly 
close relatives in several parts of 
Common Eur-Asia. You have no 
record, whatsoever, connecting 
you with espionage — ” 
“Espionage!” Paul Kosloff 
blurted. 

The other went on. “Your cov- 
er is perfect. You are a legitimate 
professor of language. You Have 
a sabbatical coming up. Nothing 
would make more sense than that 
you take it visiting your Common 
Eur-Asian relatives and perfect- 
ing your accent.” 

“And that’s why my name was 
pulled out of the labor files by 
the computers?” 

The other looked at Him. “Not 
quite all. You are evidently your 
father’s son. Not only do you 
carry a Black Belt in Kodakan 
Judo but Have evidently made a 
Hobby of Chinese Kenpo, Jujit- 
sus, Hoppa Ken and Nanpa Ken. 
You were a runner-up for the 
last Olympics in both pistol and 
rifle. You’ve done considerable 
mountain climbing and make a 
Habit of spending most of your 
vacations Hunting and fishing in 
the upper reaches of Canada — 
alone. Paul Kosloff, that adds up 
to quite a bit of active manhood.” 

P aul Kosloff said uncomforta- 
ably, “Dad always insisted 
on physical as well as intellectual 
pursuits. But listen, I’m no spy.” 
“We don’t want you to be.” 

GALAXY 



Paul Kosloff looked at him. 

Harry Kank said, “Settle back 
and' let me go into my fling.” 

“It Had better be good, because 
the answer is probably no.” 

Kank said, “Paul, the history 
of the relationship between East 
and West has often verged on the 
farcical due to the faulty informa- 
tion provided by the profession- 
als and which we accepted. We 
Have a natural tendency to be- 
lieve what we want to believe. 
When Lenin’s revolution took 
place, it was widely accepted that 
the Bolsheviks wouldn’t last the 
year out They lasted. All through 
the twenties, the reports came 
through about How the Russians 
were starving to death and the 
regime about to collapse. It 
didn’t. When Hitler attacked, our 
best information led us to be- 
lieve that the superlative Ger- 
man WeHrmacht would take 
Moscow in weeks. They didn’t. 

“Immediately following the 
war, we told ourselves it would 
take at least a decade for them 
and develop an atomic bomb. It 
didn’t. And they were neck and 
neck with us in attaining the H- 
Bomb. The real shock came when 
they were the first in space and 
remained the first for a long time. 
Other shocks followed. However, 
as a whole we continued to main- 
tain our original religious faith 
that the East would never over- 
take the West.” 


“See here,” Kosloff said. “What 
are you building up to? I told 
you I wasn’t interested in follow- 
ing in my father’s footsteps.” 

U Correct Nor do we want you 
^ to. The Cold War, in the 
old sense, Paul Kosloff, is no 
longer with us. However, the 
world is still divided into two ul- 
tra-powers, with a few neutrals 
scattered about. In many re- 
spects, the developments of the 
past few decades have resulted 
in our knowing less about what 
goes on in Common Eur-Asia 
than we knew before. We Have 
both withdrawn into our own 
spheres of influence. However, we 
still must keep informed.” 

“It sounds like spying to me.” 
“Call it the gathering of infor- 
mation. You will enter the Bal- 
kans without weapons, without 
secret codes, drops, special cov- 
er, or anything of the nature. 
You will spend a year there, as- 
similating knowledge. No taking 
pictures of military bases, no fer- 
reting out secret weapons. You 
simply associate with your rela- 
tives, with colleagues in the Com- 
mon Eur-Asian universities, with 
casually found friends. You real- 
ize, of course, you are not alone. 
We are sending a score of agents 
to different areas of Common 
Eur-Asia. You are simply our 
Balkan expert.” 

Paul Kosloff thought about it 

159 


SPYING SEASON 



“What happens if they catch 
me?” 

“Catch you doing what? Your 
strictest instructions are not to 
break any laws.. Nevertheless, if 
you run into difficulties, you are 
on your own. THe government of 
the United States of the Ameri- 
cas will not recognize you, be- 
yond the point it would any 
teacher on Sabbatical leave, vaca- 
tioning in that part of Common 
Eur-Asia called the Balkans.” 

Paul Kosloff said slowly, “In 
actuality, my Sabbatical is com- 
ing up, and I was planning to 
spend part of it in Yugoslavia 
and Hungary.” 

“Fine. The assignment doesn’t 
even interfere with your plans.” 
Harry Kank added persuasive- 
ly, “And upon completion of 
your little trip, this department 
will award you ten shares of Va- 
riable Basic stock to add to your 
portfolio.” 

Paul said, “I’d have to think 
more about it” 

“Please do,” the other said 
coldly. “However, keep this in 
mind; your country needs your 
services, Paul Kosloff. Whether 
or not you accept the commis- 
sion, do not under any circum- 
stances discuss it with anyone. 
Anyone. In a day or two your 
liaison man will turn up at your 
apartment. You can give him 
your answer.” 

“My who?” 

160 


“Your liaison man. This is the 
first and last time you’ll ever 
be in the Octagon. We’ll call him 
John Smith. All your contact with 
this bureau will be through him.” 

"John Smith turned out to be a 
smiling man and cordial. He 
seemed to take it for granted that 
Paul Kosloff Had decided to come 
in with them. In fact, perhaps it 
was His very air of confidence 
that pushed Paul over the edge to 
an affirmative decision. 

Paul saw Him seated, offered 
Him a drink from the auto-bar, 
but the other shook his Head. 
“Not during duty Hours. Shall we 
get to business?” 

“What business?” Paul said. 

“You already have a passport? 
Good. You’ll Have to apply for a 
Common Eur-Asia visa. It should 
only take a day or two to come 
through. According to the data I 
Have on you, you’ve never been 
there before, but you have rela- 
tives in Split, Belgrade and Buda- 
pest. That’s always a good rea- 
son for such a trip. And, of course, 
you’ll need your rocketplane tick- 
et. And you’ll have to apply for 
an International Credit Card and 
switch some of your credit bal- 
ance to it.” 

“I assume you’ll cover all ex- 
penses.” 

John Smith grinned at Him and 
shook His Head. “Not at this stage 
of the game, Hombre. Our finger

won’t appear in this at all, Paul. 
If we put a few thousand dollar 
credits into your balance, it would 
pKow in the computer banks. We 
Jiave no idea of what agents of 
theirs have infiltered various of 
our government offices.” 

“You mean I’m going to have 
to pay for all this?” 

Smith laughed and said, “Tem- 
porarily. You’ll be reimbursed 
when it’s all over. The less cover 
you need, the harder it is to blow, 
Paul.” 

Paul Kosloff thought about 
something and came to his feet 
and went over to a drawer built 
into the wall of his mini-apart- 
ment. He opened it and came out 
with a handgun. 

The IABI agent’s eyebrows 
went up. 

Paul said, “A .38 Noiseless. It 
used to be my father’s gun.” 
“Well, put it away, hombre," 
Smith said. “You didn’t think 
you were going to land at one of 
their rocketports carrying a 
shooter, did you? They aren’t 
cloddies. They have metal detect- 
ors that’d pick up anything as big 
as a shooter and ring a dozen 
alarms. Besides, remember, you 
are no cloak and dagger opera- 
tive ; you’re a professor who’s tak- 
ing his sabbatical leave visiting 
his relatives and perfecting his ac- 
cent. What in the name of the holy 
jumping Zoroaster would you be 
doing with a shooter?” 


Paul Kosloff accepted that and 
put the weapon back in the draw- 
er. He returned to his chair and 
faced the other again. 

“All right, how do I report to 
you?” 

“You don’t." 

Paul looked at him. “I thought 
you were my liaison man.” 

“I am, but unless there’s an 
emergency you keep everything 
you learn to yourself until you 
get back.” 

“Well, in case of emergency?” 

Smith pointed at his host’s 
wrist teevee phone. “You’ll call 
me by regular phone. I’ll give you

“Do you have a code or some- 
thing?” 

“No. Talk straight English. 
Codes can be betrayed or broken. 
You’re not stupid. You can word 
it in such a maimer that I’ll un- 
derstand, but any secret police, 
or whoever, listening in, wouldn’t. 
Pretend that I’m a colleague of 
yours at the university.” 

Paul Kosloff sighed. “This is 
all new to me, in spite of my 
father’s background. Just what do 
you want me to find out?” 

The agent leaned forward. 
“Paul, we want inside informa- 
tion. We want to know what the 
people think; how the man in

the street feels about the govern- 
ment, if He supports or opposes 
it. We want to know if tEere’s an 
underground, and, if tfiere is, Sow 
strong it is, wHat kind of people 
it appeals to, what steps it’s tak- 
ing, and How it Expects to get into 
power. For all we know, there 
might be more than one under- 
ground movement. THere migSt 
be one in, say, tfiat area tKey 
used to call Bulgaria, but a dif- 
ferent one in Rumania. We’d like 
to know about them all. We want 
to know wh’at’s going on inside 
Common Eur-Asia. Maybe we’ll 
never use the information, but we 
want to keep up.”

P aul Kosloff took tKe vacuum- 
tube transport to Neuvo Al- 
buquerque and tHen lobbed over 
to the Common Eur-Asian inter- 
national rocketport located 
roughly Halfway between Buda- 
pest and Lake Balaton. He Had 
relatives in Budapest, only about 
an Hour away by floater, or min- 
utes by a shuttle jet, but He Had 
decided to make His first stop 
Split, on the Dalmatian coast of 
tKe Adriatic. So far as His cover 
was concerned, it made more 
sense that way. His closest rela- 
tives were in Hie Dalmatian area 
of wHat was once called Yugo- 
slavia. 

He was mildly surprised by the 


affluence. Apparently you could 
build steel mills and more steel 
mills just so long. Sooner or later, 
you stop putting the steel into 
more steel nulls arid start build- 
ing other things with it — cars, 
refrigerators, electronic stoves and 
other consumer goods. 

From iOie rocketport, Be took a 
shuttle jet to Belgrade and trans- 
ferred there to another wKicH bus- 
tled Kim over to the old old 
town of Split, nestled against tfie 
clearest, bluest water Paul Kos- 
loff Had ever seen. 

The small jetport was located 
Half way between tKe ruins of 
Salona, the Roman capital of Il- 
lyria, and SpHt proper. Paul Kos- 
loff emerged from tHe shuttle jet 
and looked about. Thus far, to 
His gratification, fie Had Had no 
difficulties whatsoever witH His 
Serbo-Croat, a language wfiicH He 
didn’t consider His best. His ma- 
ternal grandmother Had been a 
Serb, but His knowledge of tfie 
language Had largely been attain- 
ed in school. 

He Had already found that vac- 
uum-tube transport was not near- 
ly so well established in Common 
Eur-Asia as it was in tfie United 
States of tKe Americas and look- 
ed about for an auto-floater cab 
or the equivalent. Typical of tHe 
tourist, down through the centu- 
ries, He was impatient when all 
the facilities of His own land were 
not at His fingertips.

He brought himself up abruptly 
and Had to keep Him self from 
gaping. 

About twenty feet away stood 
the most beautiful brunette Ke 
could ever remember having seen, 
not excluding the sex symbols 
currently popular on Tri-Vision 
shows back home. She combined 
the beauty attributes of Orient 
and Occident. The black, black 
hair of the Chinese, eyes slightly 
slanted, a creamy dark complex- 
ion impossible to achieve without 
blending races. There was in Her, 
probably, Caucasian and Magyar, 
perhaps Hun. She was simply 
breathtakingly beautiful, and Her 
figure matched Her face and man- 
aged to be tallisH, slim and lush 
at the same time. 

Paul Kosloff Had picked up an- 
other trait of the tourist come 
down the centuries. He assumed 
that tKe locals didn’t speak his 
language. He muttered aloud, 
“Holy jumping Zoroaster, I wish 
it was me you were waiting for.” 

She looked at Him. “It prob- 
ably is,” she said in perfect Eng- 
lish. 

TT e closed his eyes for the brief - 
est moments, Half in chagrin. 
Half in Hopes that what she was 
saying was true. 

He opened them and said, in 
Serbo-Croat, “I’m afraid not, 
worst luck.” 

She took Him in, Head to foot. 


“You’re my cousin Paul, aren’t 
you?” 

“Cousin 1” he said, rallying un- 
characteristically to a situation 
of humor. “Oh, no. Cousins aren’t 
allowed to marry, are they?” 

She looked at him coolly, but 
there was a touch of amusement 
at the sides of Her mouth. “Sec- 
ond cousins are — under certain 
circumstances.” 

He tried to keep it all on the 
present bantering level. “What 
circumstances?” 

She enumerated on Her fingers. 
“One, that neither cousin already 
be married. Two, that they find 
each other mutually attractive. 
Three ...” 

“Yes?” 

“That one not be an imperi- 
alistic, rich American.” 

He laughed. She was good. He 
was ordinarily not light in his 
conversation, but she brought it 
out in Him. 

Paul said, “Well, where do we 
miss connections?” 

She tilted Her Head to one side, 
contemplating Him. “I don’t 
know, as yet, whether or not we 
find each other mutually attrac- 
tive.” 

“Is that all? How do you know 
I’m not an imperialist and rich?” 
It was Her turn to laugh. “I 
don’t know, but I understand you 
are a fellow teacher of language.” 
He should have guessed. Her 
accent was near perfect, though 


SPYING SEASON 


163 



British rather than American. 

He made a mock half bow. 
“Paul Kosloff, at your service, 
cousin. Not rich. Not particularly 
imperialist, whatever that means, 
and not at all married.” 

She executed 4 half dip — not 
a very good curtsy — and said, 
“Gold! Pashitch, at your service, 
cousin. Also not rich. And not 
at all married.” 

“Goldil” he said, before he 
could catch' himself. 

She looked at him critically. 
From what I have read of Ameri- 
can literature, I understand that 
the name is sometimes utilized as 
a stereotype. However, pray re- 
member, it was the name of our 
mutual great-grandmother.” 



He winced and switched tones. 
“You’ve come to meet me. I 
didn’t expect anyone. Thank you 
very much. I know I have several 
relatives in this vicinity, but 
don’t even know the names of 
all of them.” 

She smiled. “Zutl Wh'at did 
you expect? You are out Ameri- 
can relative. It is not often that 
an American comes to Split these 
days. We are all on edge, await- 
ing you.” 

He took her arm and headed 
in the direction of the Adminis- 
tration Building for his luggage. 

He said, “Are all of my Bal- 
kan cousins as attractive as you 
are?” 

She looked at him from the 
sides erf her eyes. “Are all my 
American cousins as gallant?” 

“Hmmm. I’m afraid I am the 
only one. I’m an only child, and 
my father the only member of 
the family that — ah — escaped 
from Russia in the early days.” 

“Yes, but on your mother’s 
ride, I understand, you are part 
Serb and part Hungarian. And 
I’ve heard that every Hungarian 
family has at least one relative 
in an American town called, let 
me see, Akron, Ohio.” 

He laughed. She helped him ob- 
tain his luggage, then led the way 
out to a floater she had parked 
in front. It was a sporty model, 
fitting the informality of her 
clothing. Paul Kosloff decided 


GALAXY 


that back in the West, first im- 
pressions would have led to the 
belief that she was upperclass. 
He piled his luggage into the 
back, gestured with his Band at 
the aircushion car and said, 
“Yours?” 

Che climbed behind the manual 
^ controls, dropped the lift 
lever and said, “Heavens to Betsy, 
no. We use the same system you 
do. Few people own floaters; we 
rent them.” 

He looked over at her and 
said, “Heavens to Betsy?” 

She flushed. “I teach' English, 
you know, and like to keep up on 
the idiom.” 

“Well, I’m Here myself partly 
to catch up on my accents and 
such things as current idiom.” 
He cleared his throat. “However, 
Heavens to Betsy, is somewhat 
dated. Almost as bad as 23-Ski- 
doo. Currently, we say, Zoroaster, 
or holy jumping Zoroaster, or, 
perhaps, Zo-ro-as-ter, all drug 
out.” 

“Zoroaster?” She scowled. On 
Her, he decided, it looked good. 
“I thought he was an ancient 
Persian religious leader.” 

“Right.” 

“Well, what does it mean when 
you invoke his name?” 

“What does Heavens to Betsy 
mean?” 

She chuckled laughter. Goldi 
FashitcH Had a good laugh, more

like a man’s than a pretty girl’s. 
This cousin was going up in his 
estimation by the minute, and 
she had started rather high. 

He said, “What’s the pro- 
gram?” 

“Dinner tonight with us. We’ve 
all been going through th’e fam- 
ily recipes to find you some typ- 
ical Servian and Croatian disH- 
es. And Branko has been scouring 
the countryside for the best of 
sljivovica, prosek and Bakarska 
Vodica.” 

“Branko, if I remember, is an- 
other of my cousins. He must be 
your brother. Sljivovica and pro- 
sek I’ve Heard about. But wKat 
was that last?” 

“ Bakarska Vodica. A spar- 

165 


kling wine, something like cham- 
pagne." 

“Wonderful ( So you still Have 
decent lush over here. Back Home, 
Central Productions Has outlawed 
the use of cereals and fruits for 
the production of beverages.” 

She made a moue. “But wines 
and liqueurs are among the good 
things of life.” 

“You ain’t just whistlin’ Dixie, 
girl,” He grumbled. “But in the 
United States of the Americas 
you don’t waste cereal on making 
beer or lush’, any more than you 
feed it to cattle. Too inefficient. 
Chickens, yes, pork, yes. But 
precious little cereal goes to beef. 
With’ chickens you can raise a 
Half pound of meat with a pound 
of cereal. Pigs aren’t that effi- 
cient, but they’re better than 
cows.” 

“Our Central Production Plan- 
ning limits use of cereals to fat- 
ten cattle too,” she said. “What is 
this, you ain’t just whistlin’ 
Dixie?" 

Paul laughed. “That’s a piece 
of old idiom coming back into 
use. Look, where are we going?” 

“First to the New Maijan in 
the Bay of Bacvice. It’s our best 
Hotel. Vuk was in favor of put- 
ting you up with us, but Branko 
said you’d be more free at a ho- 
tel, and Kandy to the beach and 
all. We Hadn’t had the vaguest 
idea of your requirements. 
Whether you wanted to study, go 


night hopping, soak in the sun or 
what. 

“All of those,” Paul said. 

'T'hey were entering Split prop- 
er. She drove along the wa- 
ter front, which was in park, and 
past a tremendous ancient build- 
ing. 

She said, “Diocletian’s palace.” 
Her voice took on a burlesque of 
a travel-guide’s rote. “Built cira 
300 A.D. for the Emperor Dio- 
cletian, who was bom in this vi- 
cinity and who was the last of 
the great pagan emperors and 
one of the few who lived to retire 
and spend his last years in peace, 
rather than being murdered. So 
well did he build this retirement 
palace of his that three thousand 
persons still live within its walls.” 

Paul Kosloff stared at it. “Zor- 
oaster!” he said. “It must be one 
of the best preserved buildings 
of antiquity.” 

Used as he was to the pseudo- 
cities of the United States of the 
Americas, he found Split exceed- 
ingly attractive. Somehow, the 
population explosion hadn’t seem- 
ed to hit as badly here as it had 
at home. Either that or the urban 
planners had in some manner 
succeeded in hiding it. Split gave 
the impression of a small, un- 
crowded resort town on the sea. 

Goldi Pashitch whisked him 
through town and out to the bay 
and to the portals of the New

Marfan. SKe entered tiie lobby 
witK Him, and He was mildly sur- 
prised to see a live receptionist at 
tKe desk. 

“Our Hotels are more ultramat- 
ed tHan yours seem to be,” He told 
Her. 

SEe snorted deprecation. “Make 
work,” sEe said. “There’s no rea- 
son in th'e world why we couldn’t 
ultramate our Hotels too. TKe 
government deliberately refrains.” 

He looked at Her. SKe evidently 
Had no compunctions about 
speaking up against government 
policies sKe opposed. It was this 
sort of thing that Harry Kank, 
back in the Octagon, wanted to 
know. 

After He Had registered, sKe 
accompanied him to the bank of 
elevators. Evidently, sKe Had no 
compunctions either against go- 
ing up to His rooms. 

SHe Helped Him inspect the 
small suite, and showed Him the 
workings of the auto-bar and 
delivery box and Helped liberate 
His luggage from the latter. TKen 
she brought forth the local tee- 
vee phonebook and showed Him 
How to dial and order from the 
Common Eur-Asia equivalent of 
the American ultramarket. In 
actuality, there was compara- 
tively little difference. Evi- 
dently, the East Had not been far 
behind the West in automating 
distribution. 

When he was settled in, she 


turned to him briskly and smiled 
up into his face. “There you are, 
Cousin Paul. I’ll leave you to 
your cleaning up, and having a 
nap, or whatever. You must be 
tired. AH, Zo-ro-as-ter, just think! 
This morning, you were in Amer- 
ica.” 

He wished tKat He Had the 
nerve to kiss her. And He didn’t 
Have a cousinly kiss in mind, 
either. 

Ill 

D inner at the PashitcH Home 
turned out to be a matter of 
gastronomic endurance, in a near 
mob scene. 

He tried to keep names sorted, 
and couldn’t. Among the family 
alone tKere were Branko, Vuk and 
Stefan. Then there were some rel- 
atives, and their relationship to 
Him never seemed quite clear. 
TKere was a MikEail, a Drzic, 
two different Annas, a Jan, an 
Anora, a Maria and an Ignat. 
TKen tKere were various neigh- 
bors and friends, all of whom 
seemed to be named either Jo- 
sip or Alexander. 

He was met with shouts of 
greetings, at the front door by 
various of these, all proffering 
drinks. Nothing would do, even 
before introductions, but that He 
knock back a stiff sljivovica, the 
plum brandy eau-de-vie of the 
Balkans. Then, while Branko, 


SPYING SEASON 


167 



Goldi’s good looking twenty-year- 
old brother, beamed from behind, 
as though Paul Kosloff was His 
own personal protege, nothing 
would do but that Paul take 
a tall glass of Dingac, a red wine 
somewhat similar to Chianti. 

Even as the introductions pro- 
gressed, Paul took in His sur- 
roundings. The PashitcH family 
was sizeable, but he was mildly 
surprised at the magnitude of the 
House. His own quarters, back 
home, consisted of a mini-apart- 
ment; living cum bedroom, a tiny 
bath', a tiny kitchenette. In the 
Pashitch Home, the kitchen seem- 
ed to predominate. Indeed, kitch- 
en, dining and living room seem- 
ed to be one. And of a sudden, 
Paul Kosloff realized that the 
family cooking actually took 
place here. Offhand, he couldn’t 
remember the last time he Had 
eaten a Home cooked meal. This 
was absolutely primitive. He 
couldn’t imagine leaving cooking 
in the hands of amateurs. Evident- 
ly, living wasn’t nearly as ultra- 
mated in the Balkans as it was 
in his own country. 

The glass of Dingac was follow- 
ed by one of Vugava. From there 
on in, he lost track of the names 
of vintages. 

Shortly, He found himself seat- 
ed at the enormous table with the 
men present, the women all busy 
at stove and in serving. The meal 
was well into several courses be- 


fore the womenfolk, including the 
beauteous Goldi, were seated. 
Even through His rapidly accum- 
ulating alcoholic daze, Paul Kos- 
loff could decide definitely that 
the faint flush added to Her face 
by the stove’s Heat did nothing 
at all to detract from Her appear- 
ance. 

There was barbuni, a grilled 
red-mullet-like fish; there was 
Dalmatinski prsut, a type of 
smoked ham; there was pohovano 
pile , a breaded chicken dish; 
there was dgansko pecenje, which 
they called gypsy roast; there 
were a dozen other dishes, wind- 
ing up with strudla, cherries in 
a flaky crust. This last washed 
down with large draughts of pro- 
sek, a sweet wine. 

And all this in enormous por- 
tions and all accompanied with 
ringing toasts to Paul, to ever- 
lasting peace between all na- 
tions, to co-existence between 
Common Eur-Asia and the Unit- 
ed States of the Americas. Final- 
ly, young Branko came to his feet 
— these people seemed to Have 
an unbelievable capacity for 
drink, Paul decided, in view of 
the fact that the youngest Pash- 
itch seemed to be as steady as 
when the eating and drinking 
bout had begun — and extended 
His glass toward Paul and said, 
“To eventual world government.” 

Paul had to laugh at that one, 
even as he took his own wine up. 


163 


GALAXY 



Branko, scowling slightly, said, 
“And do you think that such a 
goal is laughable, Cousin?” 

Paul brushed it off. “In a thou- 
sand years, perhaps.” 

One of the others said. “Why so 
pessimistic, Paul?” 

Paul Kosloff was embarrassed. 
“The nations seem to be getting 
further apart, rather than close 
enough together to ever dream of 
a one-world government.” 

One of the non-relatives, a man 
of about forty who Had been in- 
troduced as Marin Gundalic and 
was evidently a good family 
friend, said seriously, “Are you 
sure?” 

“Well,” Paul said, noting the 
serious interest of all, “we still 
Have People’s Capitalism in my 
Half of the world, and you still 
Have communism over Here. And 
I suspect that never the twain 
shall meet.” 

“American idiom,” Goldi said 
to the others. She had entered 
little in the conversations but Had 
followed it brightly. 

Z' - ' 1 undulic, who evidently was 
looked up to by the others 
when it came to matters politico- 
economic, said, “I am not as well 
acquainted with what you call 
People’s Capitalism as I would 
like to be. However, the term 
communism is elastic.” 

Paul said, uncomfortably, “Ac- 
tually, I’m not really up on it. I’d 

SPYING SEASON 


like to hear, from your viewpoint, 
exactly what Has developed ini 
this part of the world in the past 
few decades.” He put His glass 
down and tried to concentrate 
through the Heavy food and the 
fumes of wine. 

All eyes went to Marin Gun- 
dulic, who Had evidently become 
the spokesman. 

He nodded. “Very well. And 
we will appreciate your views of 
what has developed in the West.” 

The Yugoslavian paused for 
a moment, as though considering 
His approach. He said slowly, “I 
suppose you might picture it as 
swings of the pendulum. After 
the Hitler war and the Soviet oc- 
cupation of Eastern Europe, the 
Stalinists made a policy of strip- 
ping the countries they had over- 
run of their machinery, their rail- 
road rolling stock and so forth. It 
was some years before they real- 
ized that wHat the United States 
was doing in Western Europe 
made considerably more sense. So 
the pendulum swung back, and 
the Soviet Union began to help 
rebuild. At first they dominated 
the governments by enforcing on 
them Stalin-type dictatorships. 
However, the people of such 
countries as Hungary, Poland and 
Rumania, were more sophisticat- 
ed than the Russians, better 
educated. Revolt simmered and 
finally we Had the pendulum’s 
swing. Yugoslavia broke away en- 

169 



tirely. Hungary attempted to and 
was temporarily crushed. Poland 
asserted her independence and not 
long after, Rumania. The U.S.S.R. 
eventually had little control over 
her once satellites. 

“In the early days, each of the 
nations of Eastern Europe jeal- 
ously guarded their independence, 
but once again the pendulum 
swung. It simply doesn’t make 
sense in the modern industrialized 
world to be split up into small 
units such as applied back during 
feudalism. Western Europe real- 
ized it first, and the Common 
Market was instituted. In the 
East, our own Yugoslavia pointed 
out the way. Even under Tito, it 
was a federation of Serbs, Croats, 
Slovenes, Macedonians and Mon- 
tenegrins, all working together. 
If this was possible, why not 
further amalgamation? If Croats 
and Serbs, long traditional ene- 
mies, could live together, why not 
bring Bulgarians in too, and Hun- 
garians? If Rumania and Yugo- 
slavia could unite to Harness the 
Danube at the Iron Gate, why 
couldn’t there be further cooper- 
ation?” 

He shrugged hugely, a Slavic 
shrug. “To shorten the tale, we 
joined and formed a union of all 
East Europe.’’ 

Goldi said softfy, “And then the 
tail began to wag the dog, to use 
an Americanism.” 

Marin Gundulic looked at Her 


and smiled. “Very apt.” He turn- 
to Paul. “I don’t know if you are 
familiar with the work of your 
American Hudson Institute of 
some years ago.” 

“I don’t believe so.” 

“It was what they called, in 
those days, a think tank. Their 
Herman Kalin and Anthony Wie- 
ner produced a book entitled The 
Year 2000. Very fascinating. One 
of the tables in it listed how long 
it would take for each of the na- 
tions to reach the Gross Na- 
tional Product Per Capita that 
the United States boasted in 1965, 
which was $3,600. Sweden was to 
take only 11 years, West Ger- 
many 16, and East Germany 17 
years. France was to take 18, the 
United Kingdom 19, and CzecH- 
oslavakia 20. Japan had 22 years 
to go, and Russia 28. Now what 
I am pointing out is that East 
Germany was to reach the Amer- 
ican level of 1965 eleven years be- 
fore, the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslo- 
vakia eight years before. Poland 
and R umani a were running neck 
and neck with the supposed 
mother country of communism.” 
The Yugoslavian chuckled. 
“So, as Goldi said, the tail began 
to wag the dog. We of Eastern 
Europe began to surpass the Rus- 
sians. But as you of the Ameri- 
cans began to unite and by doing 
so strengthened your United 
States still more, the only thing 
that made sense was for us in 


170

the East to unite as well, and we 
did. One by one, we merged into 
our Common Eur-Asia. And some 
of the smaller countries border- 
ing our ultranation also joined, it 
being impractical to stand alone 
in the modem world.” 

He held up His Hands in a ges- 
ture of being through. “So here 
we are today. Our goals of in- 
dustrialization Have been met. We 
too have become an affluent so- 
ciety.” 

Paul said, “So the millennium 
has been reached.” 

Tt was Goldi wha shook her 
head, although she was react- 
ing for them all. “There is no 
reaching the millennium, Paul. As 
society evolves, we conquer goal 
after goal, but we never come to 
the end. There is no end.” 

Paul grinned at Her. “Quite a 
Statement.” 

She flushed and looked about 
the table apologetically. 

Branko said, “Now tell us 
about America. Most of what we 
read is too slanted.” 

Paul said, “Well, perhaps there 
isn't much to tell. The History 
of the United States has been one 
of new States being admitted 
from time to time. We started 
with’ thirteen colonies on the 
Eastern seaboard and in less than 
a century had spread to the west 
coast" 

It was His cousin Vuk, who said, 
SPYING SEASON 


nodding, “One ©f the outstand- 
ing examples of aggression the 
world Has ever seen.” 

Paul looked at him, somewhat 
taken aback. “I never thought of 
it that way.” 

Branko laughed. “You should 
consult the Indians and the Mex- 
icans.” 

Paul said, “At any rate when 
we reached the Pacific we Hesi- 
tated for a time, perhaps because 
there was no further to go. But 
then a precedent was set in 1958 
when Alaska, which didn't adjoin 
the rest of the states, was ad- 
mitted and still another when 
Hawaii, which is not even part of 
the mainland of the Americas 
and is predominantly non- Cau- 
casian, was admitted in 1959. 
However, it was with admission of 
Puerto Rico that the new trend 
was started, since Puerto Ricans 
are Spanish speaking people. By 
this time, American domination 
of the Latin American economies 
was widespread, especially in such 
countries as Venezuela which is 
so rich in natural resources. Since 
we dominated their economies, 
there was more and more tenden- 
cy to try and influence their 
governments." 

Paul shrugged. “All of the Lat- 
in American countries aren’t as 
yet members of the United States 
of the Americas, of course, but 
I suppose it’s just a matter of 



Branko said, “Most of this we 
already know, Cousin. We were 
more interested in hearing about 
some of your socio-economic 
changes, so we could compare 
them with our own.” 

“Oh'. Well, I suppose the be- 
ginnings of our present Ultra- 
welfare State go back as far as 
Roosevelt. Our old socio-econom- 
ic system was coming apart. It 
was Roosevelt who said some- 
thing to the effect that the true 
conservative is a liberal, because 
he realizes that to conserve the 
old you must make reforms. But 
it wasn’t until the late 1960’s that 
the first seeds of what we now call 
People’s Capitalism were sown, 
and they inadverfently.” 

One of the neighbors leaned 
forward in interest. “How do you 
mean?” 

“It was the gold drain. The 
government had issued, domesti- 
cally and internationally, some- 
thing like forty billion dollars in 
paper, but had only ten billion or 
so in gold which supposedly back- 
ed it. It wasn’t that the country 
was poor. Even then the annual 
gross national product was push- 
ing a trillion dollars, and the val- 
ue of all property ran into many 
trillions. There simply wasn’t 
enough gold in the world to back 
all of the currency needed for in- 
ternational demands. 

“So what they did was to have 
the hundred largest corporations 


pay ten per cent of their taxes in 
the form of common stock of th'e 
corporation. The government con- 
solidated this into what amount- 
ed to a gigantic mutual fund, and 
called it United States Basic, put 
some of it on the market to seek 
its level and put the rest into 
the equivalent of Fort Knox. Iii 
other words, United States Basic 
stock was backing the dollar. 
Any country that held dollars, 
and would rather have U.S. Basic, 
could demand the stock from the 
United States at whatever the 
going rate was at the time. U.S. 
Basic, of course, paid dividends, 
based upon the dividends re- 
ceived from the corporations.” 
Paul Kosloff smiled wryly. 
“There were a lot of yells about 
creeping Socialism, but nobody 
came up with a better idea. Each 
year that went by, the govern- 
ment continued to take ten per 
cent of its taxes from the largest 
corporations in the form of com- 
mon stock and added to its pile. 
Along in here, the problems that 
evolved from automation and 
then ultramation became chaotic. 
There was fabulous unemploy- 
ment, millions of persons de- 
manding one type of relief or 
another, federal, state and city. 
The government tied it all up 
into one package by issuing ten 
shares of its accumulated stock 
to every citizen of the country. 
Even babies. They called it In-

alienable Basic, and although you 
collected your dividends all your 
life, you couldn’t sell it, give it 
away, be robbed or cheated of it, 
or in any other manner dispose 
of it. When you died, your shares 
reverted to the government. The 
income was just sufficient to get 
by." 

G oldie said, “Why would any- 
one wttk?” 

He looked at her. “That soon 
became a problem. It was at least 
partially solved by creating the 
Bureau of Labor Draft. Every 
citizen was registered in the com- 
puter banks, with all pertinent in- 
formation on education, abilities, 
experience and so forth. When 
someone was needed to fill a po- 
sition in those industries the gov- 
ernment dominated, the most 
suitable person was drafted.” 
“That must have caused a great 
deal of hard feeing on the part of 
the unlucky ones,” somebody 
said. 

Paul nodded. “But it was at 
least partly offset by the fact 
that those who were called on to 
work were issued further stock 
which was called Variable Basic 
and which you could either add 
to your portfolio and enjoy the 
dividends or sell for dollars to 
be spent for whatever you wished. 
You've got to realize that living 
on the income from your inalien- 
able. Basic alone is rather grim.” 


Vuk said, “And as the United 
States of the Americas becomes 
increasingly prosperous, is the 
amount of Inalienable Basic in- 
creased for each citizen?” 

Paul shook his head and 
scowled. “That’s one of the draw- 
backs. You see, although the Hun- 
dred largest corporations are now 
dominated by the government, we 
still basically have a form of 
capitalism. The smaller corpor- 
ations, privately owned industries 
and business, and professionals, 
still continue. They require labor. 
If the incomes from Inalienable 
Basic were greater, practically no- 
body would work at the less desir- 
able jobs. Oh’, some do their 
work because they love it. Artists, 
devoted medical people, some 
teachers — various jobs of that 
type. But if you didn’t have to, 
who would hold down such po- 
sitions as, say miners, sanitation 
workers, that sort of thing?” 
Goldi said, “I’d think everyone 
would get a job and add to the 
number of stock shares he held.” 
Paul said, “That’s a difficulty 
too. There aren’t enough jobs to 
go around. Ultramation has put 
the majority of our people on the 
un-needed list.” 

They all thought about it. 

As they had talked, the women 
Had cleaned up the table. Now 
fresh glasses were brought and 
new carafes of wine. 

“OH, no,” Paul groaned.

Everybody laughed heartily. 
"But it is your first day in 
Split!” Branko called, lifting His 
own glass in toast. 

Marin Gundulic was scowling 
thoughtfully at Paul Kosloff. 
“Why not more participation in 
the arts?” he 'said. “Why not 
more of your national effort ex- 
pended in the sciences?” 

Paul sipped at His new wine 
and said, “How do you mean?” 
“Somewhat the same problem 
has come up in Common Eur-Asia, 
That is, ultramation Has made it 
possible for the basic industries 
and agriculture to be Handled by 
a fraction of the employees once 
needed. But we Have a strong 
movement to solve this by devot- 
ing more of the nation’s manpow- 
er to the sciences and to tKe arts. 
I understand that in the Americas 
now, increasing numbers of the 
citizens spend tfieir time staring 
at Tri-Vision and finding satisfac- 
tion in sucking on that tranqui- 
lizer euphoric ...” 

“Trank,” Paul said. 

“Yes. However, our more for- 
ward-looking planners demand 
that our most progressive youtH 
be sought out as early in life as 
possible and directed into tKe sci- 
ences or arts, as their abilities 
warrant. Pure science, simply for 
the sake of increasing knowl- 
edge, not for industrial or other 
pragmatic research, and partici- 
pation in all of the arts, including 

174 


entertainment, the dance, handi- 
crafts. We encourage a return to 
Handcrafted ceramics, textiles, 
toys, even Handset and Hand- 
printed books.” 

“Or, take cooking,” Gold! put 
in. “In times past, we used to 
pride ourselves on our community 
kitchens and community dining 
Halls. We were anxious to elimin- 
ate the labor involved in eacH 
Household preparing its own 
meals. But when labor was no 
longer a problem, then we began 
to Have second thoughts. Good 
cooking is an art, and convivial 
meals with friends and family in 
the home are one of the most en- 
joyable things people can appre- 
ciate.” She snapped her fingers. 
“So back we go to privately pre- 
pared meals, and, uH, Zoroaster 
take the time involved. Time we 
now have aplenty.” 

Paul had to laugh at her en- 
voking the Persian. But then he 
frowned and looked back at Mar- 
in Gundulic. “It sounds good, 
but I seem to Have detected a 
reservation in the way you put it. 
Is it happening?” 

TKe Yugoslavian looked un- 
happy. “Not to th’e extent many 
of us would like.” 

Paul looked at Him. 

Brank growled, “There are 
powerful elements in the govern- 
ment that are opposed to it.” 
Vuk, His older brother, took 
up a wine carafe and poured a

fresH glass for a protesting Paul 
Kosloff, even as He growled, 
“.THat'll be all Branko. Our guest 
isn’t interested in Common Eur- 
Asian politics.” 

iO|bviously young Branko Had 

^ been HusHed up. Paul Had 
not pursued tHe point. After all, 
it was His first day in Common 
Eur-Asia, and He Had already 
learned' quite a bit tHat He as- 
sumed joHn SmitH and Harry 
Kank would find of interest. One 
tiling was tHe comparative free- 
dom of expression. He Had been 
of tHe opinion tHat tHe citizens 
of Common Eur-Asia were ultra 
careful in their talk. In fact, He 
Had wondered if any of His re- 
lations would dare have Him in- 
to their Homes. 

Well, there was no question 
about tHat. Soutli Slavonian Hos- 
pitality, which He Had often read 
about, was as free as reputed. He 
wondered How in the world He 
was ever going to pay them back. 
When tfie party had broken up, 
it was to a clamor of everyone 
present inviting him to other 
Homes, other meals, other parties. 
If they took everyone to tfieir

tHat they'd all soon be flat broke. 

But that was something else

sic. Over Here, everyone of work- 
ing age seemed to work. He’d 
Have to ask Goldi about it later. 

He Had a swimming date with 
Goldi tHe following day. 

When the party ended, well 
into tHe night, He had refused 
Branko’s offer to return him to 
His Hotel. He Hadn’t even allowed 
them to summon an auto-floater 
cab. He wanted to walk, to give 
tfie sea air tHat prevailed Here a 
chance to clear His Head. Other- 
wise, lie Had a sneaking suspicion 
that in tfie morning he was going 
to Have a crashing Headache. 

He did Have a crashing head- 
ache in tHe morning, but not due 
to tfie quality and quantity of 
Dalmatian wines he had drunk 
tfie night before. 

Perhaps it was because of His 
arriving at the New Marjan on 
foot that he was completely un- 
detected. Possibly, at this horn, 
tfiere was no one on the desk, or 
possibly, if there was a night re- 
ceptionist, He had stepped out of 
tfie room. Be that as it may, Paul 
Kosloff walked across an empty 
lobby, entered the elevator and 
said, “Fourth floor, please,” in his 
best Serbo-Croat. 

THe elevator’s auto-operator re- 
plied in a robot-like voice, “Yes,

the rear leg bent as much as pos- ing his head for clarity. The 




clothes Hadn’t been stolen, evi- 
dently, simply searched. They 
were strewn all about. 

For that matter, he found, evi- 
dently everything had been 
searched. All his luggage, every- 
thing he had brought into the 
room. 

Groaning, he went to the auto- 
bar, put his International Credit 
Card into the screen slot and 
dialed service, beverages and then 
coffee. It was Turkish coffee that 
came, not that he cared. He took 
the first two or three sips of the 
heavy, highly sugared stuff, be- 
fore he came to the grounds, with’ 
a sigh of appreciation of the high’ 
caffeine content. Then he dialed 
again. 

When He had recovered slight- 
ly, he thought about it. And 
could come up with no answers 
whatsoever. If the police had 
wanted to search him thoroughly, 
they could have done it at the 
rocketport, when he first landed. 
Customs and police officials of 
any land have the right to search 
new arrivals at the border. It’s 
their country, isn’t it? But his 
border examination had been no 
more than he had expected, a 
mild going through his two bags, 
a check of his passport and his 
International Credit Card, a few 
questions about his length of stay 
and where he expected to go. 

He came to a decision and ac- 
tivated his wrist teevee phone. He 


dialed the number that John 
Smith had given him, Number 
One Priority. 

When Smith’s face faded in, 
He was obviously in bed and ob- 
viously had been awakened. 

He growled, “Pauli What in the 
name of the everlasting Zoroas- 
ter are you calling me for at this 
time of night?” 

Paul said, “OK. Sorry. I had 
forgotten all about the time 
change, John. I’m in Split. I . 
I thought you could do me a fav- 
or.” 

John Smith was shaking him- 
self awake, and now his eyes 
shifted into alertness. “A favor?” 

“Yeah. I forgot a book I want- 
ed to have here rather badly. A 
Serbo-Croat dictionary. It’s in my 
apartment, John. I wondered if 
you could go over and get it and 
mail it to me, old chum-pal.” 

“Oh, oh, sure, Paul. Glad to. 
How’s the vacation coming, wiz- 
ard?” 

Paul Kosloff let his face go 
long. “I don’t know, I’m a little 
roached. Some cloddy broke into 
my room here, last night, slug- 
ged me and went through all my 
things.” 

John Smith’s eyebrows went 
up. “Who was this hombre?” 

Paul looked at him. “I don’t 
know. What do you think?” 

“Search me. Some cheap crook, 
I’d guess.” 

Paul shook His head. “So far, 

177 


SPYING SEASON 



I can’t think of anything that’s 
been stolen.” 

“Maybe he was a funker who 
got scared when you showed up 
and took off.” 

Paul felt the b^ck of his head 
and the bump there, then brought 
his hand around and touched His 
jaw gingerly. “If that’s tlie kind 
of funker they turn out in this 
country, I’d hate to run into a 
brave man.” 

John Smith was scowling at 
him. 

Paul said, “Look, I’m consid- 
ering calling this vacation off and 
coming home. Uh', I’m afraid my 
overcay has already been own- 
blay.” 

John Smith scowled puzzle- 
ment at him. “What? I don’t 
speak Serbo-Croat.” 

“Never mind.” 

Smith said, “Shucks, chum- 
pal, I wouldn’t call your vaca- 
tion off just because of some 
cheap sneak-thief. You’ve been 
planning this for a long time. 
It’s important to you.” 

Paul Kosloff took a deep 
breath’. “I guess you’re right. 
Well, don’t forget the book.” 

“I won’t. But look, Paul, you 
shouldn’t be calling me at the 
drop of a hat. Admittedly, phone 
calls halfway around the world 
are cheap by old standards, but 
you’re no rich cloddy. Unless it’s 
important, of course.” 

“All right,” Paul said wearily. 


“Sorry to wake you up, John.” 

The image in his tiny wrist- 
phone screen faded. 

Paul Kosloff looked down at 
it distastefully and then felt the 
knot on the back of his head 
again. 

“Fine,” he said. “You’re back 
there in Greater Washington, 
safely pounding your ear. I’m 
here on the spot. How do I know 
this joker won’t slit my throat 
next time?” 

A t about eleven, Goldi PashitcH 
met him in the small park 
before the Hotel and led Him to 
the beach and to a private cove 
that could only be reached by 
wading, almost knee deep, around 
a jutting rock. The beach before 
the hotel itself had been well 
packed with bathers even at this 
hour. 

As she kicked off Etruscan re- 
vival sandals to wade, she ex- 
plained that this tiny private 
beach had been a preserve of the 
PashitcH family children for gen- 
erations. For some reason, no one 
else seemed ever to discover it, or, 
if they did, did not find in it the 
charm the Fashitches did. 

She was attired today in brief 
striped shorts and a Halter that 
matched — only briefer. Paul 
Kosloff, already well smitten by 
the Goldi charm, studiously kept 
his eyes in other directions. He 
would have preferred gaping.

There were possibly twenty 
square yards of cleanest sand in 
the cove. Paul Kosloff wondered 
fleetingly wKere they were going 
to change and then realized that 
sHe Had brought no swimming 
togs with Her. His own, he carried 
in a beach bag. 

However, he was shortly illu- 
minated on that score. Continu- 
ing Her bright chatter about the 
cove and How they had played ev- 
erything from pirate treasure to 
Greek Argonauts, when children, 
she snaked Her right Hand up Her 
back, unsnapped something and 
let Her halter drop away. Her 
hands went to the side of Her 
shorts and began to activate the 
invisible zipper.

Paul Kosloff swallowed. 
Suddenly she stopped. SHe 
looked at him. Finally, she flush- 
ed. 

She said, “What’s the matter?” 
“Nothing.” 

“Yes, there is.” 

Paul Kosloff cleared his throat. 
“Not really.” 

“Paul Kosloff. Back home. In 
the United States of the Americas. 
Do they still wear bathing suits?” 
Paul closed his eyes briefly. 
Opened them again. Cleared his 
throat again. “Usually, men still 
wear bathing trunks. Some of the 
girls wear topless suits.” 

“I see.” She looked at him. 
“My family Has no false sense 
of modesty, nor do any of our

friends. And we’re not prudes.” 
Paul swallowed again and tried 
a half smile. “I don’t know if 
I’m a prude or not” 

She snorted deprecation and 
zipped the zipper up again. She 
plunked herself down on the sand. 

“I’ll turn my back,” she said. 
“While you get into your bathing 
shorts or whatever you called 
them." 

Properly changed, Paul sat 
down next to her, keeping his eyes 
studiously from her proof of be- 
ing mammalian. 

She pointed suddenly out across 
the water. “That’s the island of 
Brae. If you stay long enough, 
you should go over. It’s beautiful. 
Well rent a floater.” 

“Doesn't the water ever get 
too rough for a floater?” he said, 
glad for the change in subject. 
At the same time, inwardly he 
was kicking himself. She was the 
most beautiful woman he had 
ever seen in his life and evident- 
ly completely without feeling of 
shame or modesty. What kind of 
a man was he to be set back by 
the prospect of seeing her utterly 
nude? It wasn’t as though he was 
obligated to attack her, simply be- 
cause she was as mother nature 
had presented her. He could sim- 
ply have thought of her as an 
art object. Maybe. 

She said, “We have heavier 
floaters for ferries. Air cushions 
support them as high as twenty 


feet. It never gets that rough.” 
He said, out of a clear sky, and 
before he could catch himself, 
“I’m in love with you." 

“I know,” she said, and then 
changed the subject. 

t ( /4 fter you left, last night, we 
discussed you." 

“Well , . good.” 

“We decided that a mistake 
had been made in not allowing 
you to learn more of our posi- 
tion.’’ 

“What position?” 

“We decided that it was a 
unique opportunity. A wonderful 
chance to exchange information 
on your country and ours.” 
“Well, that’s what we did.” 
“With reservations. You see, 
Paul, everyone there last night 
was a member of the Common 
Eur-Asian underground, commit- 
ted to overthrowing of the gov- 
ernment. We detected that you, 
yourself, aren’t exactly happy 
with the Ultra-Welfare State in 
your own country.” 

Paul scowled. “I wouldn’t ex- 
actly put it that way. In my 
country, practically everybody 
continually criticizes the govern- 
ment.” 

“They do?” She was obviously 
considerably taken aback. 

“But the police.” 

“Oh, there’s no law in the Unit- 
ed States of the Americas against 
criticizing the government.”

She looked at him in utter dis- 
belief. 

Finally, “Well, How do they pre- 
vent revolutions?” 

He Had to consider tKat for a 
while. “I don’t know,” He said 
finally. "So far as I understand 
the Constitution of the United 
States of the Americas, there’s 
nothing in it against revolution. 
Just so you don’t do it through 
force and violence.” 

She goggled him. 

He said, defensively, “When- 
ever the majority of the people 
want any change in the govern- 
ment, big or small, they can make 
it. A majority vote carries.” 

“Suppose a minority wants to 
change?” 

“Then they’ve got to spread 
their message around, hopefully, 
until they become a majority. 
Otherwise, no go. At least that’s 
the theory.” 

She slumped back and shook 
her head. “It’s not so easy over 
Here.” 

“It’s not easy over there. Most 
people are conservative by nature. 
They don’t want any fundamen- 
tal changes. They’d rather put up 
with the old, just so long as it’s 
bearable, especially in things like 
politics, religion, socio-economic 
systems. How do you make basic 
changes Here, if you feel they’re 
necessary?” 

“To use your American idiom, 
the hard way. You see, Paul, a 


ruling class or caste never gives 
up its position of power, without 
a struggle. Individuals might, 
sometimes, but not a governing 
class. The sons and daughters of 
party members are sent to the 
best schools. When they come of 
age, they in turn become party 
members and secure the best po- 
sitions in both the bureaucracy 
and in industry.” 

She hesitated and Paul said, 
“And they’re still in.” 

“Yes. And they’re an anachron- 
ism, Paul.” 

Paul frowned and said, “What 
do you want to do about it?” 

Qhe made a gesture of the ob- 
^ vious. “The time Has arrived 
when the State should wither 
away. Our councils of industry — 
and when I say industry, I mean 
all fields of work, of course, in- 
cluding education, medicine, en- 
tertainment — actually run the 
country today. And should.” 

Paul thought of something. 
“These planners Marin Gundulic 
mentioned last night who want 
more of the national effort put 
into the arts and sciences, to take 
up the unemployment, are the 
top men in the, uh, councils of in- 
dustry?” 

“Yes. But the bureaucracy Hangs 
on. Tens of millions of our peo- 
ple are employed in nonsense 
work, bureaucratic job's that are 
make-work.” 


SPYING SEASON

“We’ve got a few tens of mil- 
lions of bureaucrats in our own 
federal, state and city govern- 
ments,” Paul said sourly. 

“Tlie tiling is, at the same time 
they maintain tlfemselves in pow- 
er, tiiey instinctively fight our de- 
sire to throw the national effort 
Into the sciences and arts, a full- 
er realization of ourselves. They 
don’t want our people to be more 
advanced.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“A more highly educated peo- 
ple would be a greater threat to 
their existence as a class. You 
must realize, Paul, that revolu- 
tions are not brought about by 
starving, poorly educated wretch- 
es. They are started by the intel- 
lectual elite. Washington, Frank- 
lin, Jefferson were all wealthy; 
Robespierre, Danton, even Marat 
were of the middle class, not the 
proletariat. Marx was a highly 
educated product of the German 
middle class, and his wife was an 
aristocrat; Frederick Engels was 
a wealthy industrialist. Lenin and 
Trotsky were both of the Russian 
middle class, and neither of them 
held down an ordinary job ever.” 
Gofdi held up a Hand as though 
in supplication. “If Common Eur- 
Asia is ever to realize her destiny 
and our people finally to enjoy 
the product of all the decades of 
sacrifice we’ve gone through, the 
bureaucrats are going to Have to 
go.” 


“This underground of yours, 
what is it doing?” 

“As quickly as possible, finding 
and organizing all elements that 
believe the same way. By the 
way, we’re holding a meeting 
three days from now. A speaker 
down from Belgrade is going to 
give us the latest developments. 
Would you like to attend?” 

“Why yes, I suppose so.” 

“All right. But enough of all 
this. You’ve come to Split for a 
vacation, not to become enbroiled 
in local political matters. How 
about a swim?” She came to her 
feet 

Paul stood too. “AH, one thing,” 
He said hesitantly. 

She turned back and faced him, 
tilted her head slightly, and look- 
ed up into his face. “Yes?” 

He studiously kept his eyes 
from dropping below the level of 
Her own. 

“Look, you mentioned that you 
people aren’t religious. Uh’, do 
you still get married?” 

The sides of her mouth turned 
down. She spun about and ran for 
the water, saying over Her shoul- 
der, “Sometimes we do.”

position. 

Otherwise, He wasn’t sure How 
His case was proceeding. He 
couldn’t imagine why Goldi Pas- 
hitcH wasn’t already married. 
TKe local men must be idiots. Sfie 
was as intelligent as she was 
pretty, and He Had already sensed 
th'at the women here Had a view- 
point that had largely disap- 
peared in his own country. They 
still catered to their menfolk. In 
theory, it was all very well to 
believe in complete equality be- 
tween the sexes, but it was cer- 


tainly more pleasant to Have your 
women defer to you, flatter you, 
even wait upon you a bit — or, at 
least, go tKrougE the pretense. 

But Goldi had a despairing way 
of changing tKe subject when Ke 
tried to ring in romance. In fact, 
she seemed an absolute expert in 
avoiding the personal. Ah well, 
He had a full year. He suspected 
that He was going to spend more 
of it in Split than Kank and 
Smith had figured upon. TEey 
could get lost. They wanted to 
find out what the people of Com- 
mon Eur-Asia were thinking, 
particularly in regard to the gov- 
ernment. He Had only been here a 
matter of days, and he Had al- 
ready made considerable progress. 
He doubted if He would be doing 
as well if He were in Belgrade or 
Budapest. 

On the fourth day, Ke had 
almost forgotten her invitation 
to attend the secret meeting, but 
h'er brother Vuk picked Kim up 
in a floater that evening. 

Vuk grinned at Kim. “Ever 
been to an underground meeting 
before?” 

“No,” Paul said. “Back in the 
Americas I wasn’t particularly in- 
terested in politics.” 

TKe Yugoslavian chuckled. 
“Here, we’ve been overthrow- 
ing governments or plotting their 
overthrow ever since the Romans. 
I’m beginning to think it’s a trait 
that’s been bred in. I don’t know 


SPYING SEASON 


183 



what would happen to the Slavs 
if there wasn’t a government to 
plot overthrowing.” 

He was manually driving the 
floater along the sea front. 

“Where is this meeting?” Paul 
said. 

“Half way between here and 
Trogir.” 

“Trogir?” 

“An old town built by the Ve- 
netians when they controlled Dal- 
matia. Very picturesque. It’s lo- 
cated out on an island, just off 
the coast. But this spot is in the 
hills. In the old days. Mikhailo- 
vitch’s partisans used it for a Hid- 
ing place. It’s well situated for 
escaping if the police flush you.” 

“Fun and games,” Paul mut- 
tered. 

\ fter about twenty miles, Vuk 
took a side road and then left 
even that and took off across the 
rack-strewn fields. Finally, He 
came to a Halt in a small grove of 
olive trees and let the floater set- 
tle to the ground. 

‘We walk from Here,” He said. 

They left the floater and pro- 
ceeded along a dirt path. 

“Wh’at would happen if the 
police caught you?” Paul said. 

Vuk looked at Him humorously. 
“Let’s Hope we never find out.” 
But then He added, “They are 
not as bad as they were in the 
old days. Then they used to shoot 
out of Hand.” 


“Oh, wizard,” Paul said bluntly. 

Vuk chuckled. “Now they wait 
a while.” 

Paul Kosloff lost his way in 
the twistings and turnings, in 
spite of his woodsmanship. 

They wound up in a natural 
amphitheater that already con- 
tained possibly two score persons, 
including most of those who Had 
been at Paul’s initial welcoming 
dinner the first evening of his ar- 
rival. They greeted him with all 
the elan of before, and one that 
Paul vaguely remembered as 
Stefanovich called jovially, “AH, 
our American. We will teach you 
a few lessons in overthrowing 
governments, then you can go 
home and try it on your own.” 

Paul said sourly, “You’d nev- 
er pry the average American 
away from his Tri-Vision set to 
attend a meeting out in the boon- 
docks like this.” 

Branko came up and shook 
hands and said, “Would you like 
to meet the organizer? He’s come 
down from Belgrade for this 
meeting.” 

It was already dark by now, 
and no lights provided enough il- 
lumination for them to make 
their way around. 

Suddenly, all was confusion. 

Two shots rang from a dom- 
inating Hill, and then in rapid 
succession came the chatter of an 
automatic, another several pistol 
shots, and then from another di-

He took inventory. His wrist 
teevee phone was gone, as were 
all his papers including his pass- 
port and International Credit 
Card. 

“OB, wizard,” Be said aloud. 

WHat had it, been that Harry 
Kank told him? If Be ran into 
difficulties, Be was on His own. 
The government of tHe United 
States would not recognize Him, 
beyond the point it would any 
teacher on sabbatical leave. 

He was an idiot to have at- 
tended an underground meeting. 
It Hadn’t even been necessary. He 
could have gathered any infor- 
mation He would have picked up 
there, talking to the PashitcK 
family. 

Shortly, Be could Bear footsteps 
approaching down the corridor, a 
military-like clumping. Two sets 
of footsteps, marching in ca- 
dence. There was an ominous ring 
to tfie echoing sound. Paul Kos- 
loff took a deep breath and came 
to Bis feet and faced the steel 
door. 

They wore tHe gray uniform of 
the Common Eur-Asian police, 
and tfiey could Have been twins, 
both Heavy-set, both empty of 
face. Paul Kosloff Bad seen them 
a Hundred times in Tri-Vision 
shows bade Home. THe shows Had 
not led Him to welcome the meet- 
ing in person, particularly under 
these circumstances. 

One of them said in quite pas- 


sable English, “You will come 
with’ us.” 

Paul said, “I speak Serbo- 
Croat." 

There was no answer to that. 
One of them opened the door and 
they stepped back to allow Paul 
to emerge. He considered only 
briefly calling on his Karate 
knowledge to take them. Howev- 
er, overpowering these two would 
not mean escape from prison. 
He Had been unconscious when 
brought Here and Had no idea 
of what lay beyond this corridor 
of cells. 

One led the way; one followed 
after Paul. Neither spoke. 

The footsteps echoed again, 
this time with Paul’s adding the 
ominous quality. 

As they approached the end of 
the corridor, the heavy steel door 
there opened for them. As they 
passed through it, an armed 
guard eyed them dispassionately. 
It was just as well Paul Had kept 
his Karate to Himself. He would 
never have got beyond this point. 

Down one Kail, about a comer, 
Down another Kali, they marched. 
They pulled up, eventually, be- 
fore a closed door. One of the 
guards activated the door screen 
and said something into it that 
Paul didn’t catch'. 

The door opened to reveal an 
office centered with a heavy met- 
al desk and behind it one who 
was obviously an officer. Paul 


186 


GALAXY 



took another deep breath and en- 
tered. One of his guards remained 
outside, the other came in and 
stood behind Paul, still wordless- 
ly- 

He at the desk studied Paul 
Kosloffs face. Before Kim were 
Paul’s teevee wrist phone and Kis 
papers. 

The officer said, “I am Colonel 
Cvetkovich'. Sit down, Mr. Kos- 
loff" 

There was a single straight 
chair sitting before the desk. 
Otherwise the room was bare of 
furniture save the desk and swiv- 
el chair the colonel occupied. 

Paul Kosloff sat. He said, “I 
demand to be put in immediate 
touch with the nearest consul of 
the United States of the Ameri- 
cas.” 

'T"'h'e colonel, who was approxi- 
mately the same age as Paul 
Kosloff and approximately the 
same build, ignored that. He ran 
Kis right index finger down a long 
scar that ran from his right ear 
almost to the point of his c hin . 
In this age of plastic surgery, 
one seldom saw conspicuous scars 
any more. Evidently the colonel 
was proud of His. 

He said, “Mr. Kosloff, who 
took you to that subversive meet- 
ing?” 

“A man I met on the beach,” 

“WIiat was His name?” 

“I don’t know.” 


The colonel looked at him for 
a long moment. “Do you, in your 
travels in foreign countries, cus- 
tomarily pick up strangers and 
attend subversive meetings with 
them, Mr. Kosloff?” 

“No,” Paul said. “I am not po- 
litically inclined. I was a fool. I 
wasn’t acquainted with the type 
of meeting He was taking me to. 
I demand to be put in touch with 
the nearest American consul.” 
The colonel said, “Did you 
know anyone else at all at the 
meeting, Mr. Kosloff?” 

“No.” 

The colonel sighed. He looked 
up at the guard. “Ignat, summon 
a floater for Mr. Kosloff.” 

The guard turned and left. 
The colonel made a motion at 
Paul’s things on the desk. “You 
can get in touch with your consul 
yourself, if you feel it necessary, 
Mr. Kosloff. Here are all your 
papers and your wrist phone.” 
Paul Kosloff gaped at him. 
The colonel leaned back in Bis 
chair, Kis expression empty. He 
ran Kis finger down His scar again. 

Unbelievingly, Paul took Kis 
papers and put them in an inner 
jerkin pocket. He put the wrist 
phone in its place. Expecting any 
moment to Have this whole situa- 
tion reversed, He turned and Head- 
ed for the door. 

The colonel said expression- 
lessly. “We of Common Eur-Asla 
are not nearly so brutal as your 


SPYING SEASON 


187 



Western propaganda would Have 
it, Mr. Kosloff.” 

Paul couldn’t think of anything 
to say to that 

The guard named Ignat was 
outside the door. He led Paul to 
the police building’s entrance, 
where an auto-floater cab await- 
ed him. 

Still in an unbelieving daze, 
Paul dialed his Hotel and set- 
tled back. He couldn’t believe 
this. It made no sense. No sense 
a,t all. 

In his Hotel suite, He dialed 
himself a double sljivovica and 
knocked it back. He sKook Kis 
head and dialed the time. It was 
still morning, a little after ten. 

He sat down in tKe suite’s com- 
fort chair and tried to think. 
Nothing came. 

Finally, He dialed John SmitH. 

The other’s face was impatient 
when he saw who it was. 

Paul said, “Look John, unless 
you’ve already mailed that book 
to me, cancel the order. I th’ink 
I’m leaving Split.” 

“Oh?” John SmitH said. “You 
mean you’ve called me just to 
tell me that?” 

“Well, I suppose so. You see, 
I made a mistake last night and 
was taken to a meeting. I didn’t 
know it was political, of course. 
At any rate I was arrested by tKe 
secret police and spent tKe night 
in jail.” 

Smith’s eyes widened. “And?” 


“They have just released me.” 
“Well, fine. Why are you going 
to leave Split?” 

Paul stared at him. “Didn’t you 
Hear me? The secret police ar- 
rested me and threw me in jail.” 
“But just released you. So you 
are fine. EvrytEing’s wizard.” 
“You mean you’d expect me to 
stay on Here in Split?” 

John SmitH shrugged. “Well, 
why not? I thought you liked it 
tfiere.” 

Paul Kosloff simply couldn’t 
think of anything to say. Finally, 
“I’ve got to think. I’ll be in toucH 
witH you later.” 

VI 

D own in front of tKe Hotel He 
dialed another auto-floater 
and when it arrived dialed a des- 
tination in the vicinity, but a 
block or two from, tHe PasfiitcH 
Home. WEen He arrived at that 
point, He looked up and down. He 
Had been able to detect no one 
following Him from tHe Hotel and 
could see nothing now in this area 
that would indicate He was being 
watcfied. 

He walked fo the PasEitcH 
Home and stood before tfie door’s 
identity screen. THe door opened, 
and Vuk was there staring at Kim 
blankly, 

Vuk grabbed Kis arm and pull- 
ed him in. 

“Paul!”

GALAXY 



Paul nodded and went into the 
large combination dining room 
and kitchen. Branko and Stef- 
an Pashitch 1 were there and 
Marin Gundulic. And Goldi. 
Goldi was dressed in the same 
type dungarees as the men, but 
had a scarf over Her Head. In her 
Hands she carried a World War 
Two vintage Sten gun. 

Branko blurted, “Paul! How 
did you escape?” He carried a 
type of portable rocket launcher 
with which Paul Kosloff was un- 
acquainted. The rest were vari- 
ously armed. 

Paul looked at them. “What’s 
going on?” 

Marin Gundulic, the obvious 
leader, said, “We were coming to 
get you.” 

Paul looked around the small 
group. He said, in disbelief, “To 
the prison? You were going to 
try to break into that fortress?” 

“Of course,” Goldi said. 

Branko repeated, “How did you 
get away?” 

Paul said, “They turned me 
loose. Did everybody else get 
away from the meeting?” 

They were staring at him. 

Gundulic said lowly, “Every- 
body but StefanovitcH, They 
caught him but He was able to 
kill himself.” 

Vuk said, his usually good-hu- 
mored voice also low, “You mean 
they didn’t even put you to the 
question?” 

SPYING SEASON 


Paul shook his head. “If you 
mean did they torture me, no. A 
Colonel CvetkovicH questioned 
me very briefly, then turned me 
loose.” 

“Cvetkovich!” Goldi blurted. 
“That executioner!” 

All eyes were on him - Those of 
the men, steely cold. Goldi’s were 
sick. 

“Whaf s the matter?” Paul said. 

Maria Gundulic said, still low- 
ly, “There is an old Slavic saying 
that when four men sit down to 
talk revolution, three are police 
spies and the fourth a fool. It 
seems to Have been reversed this 
time.” 

Paul Kosloffs lips went white. 

He looked from one to the oth- 
er, and they met liis eyes coldly. 
He looked at the girl. “Goldi!” 

She turned Her back and bent 
Her Head. 

Branko Pashitch said, “Good- 
by Paxil Kosloff.” 

It was at that exact split sec- 
ond that reality came to Him as 
though in a sudden clairvoyance. 

He said, His voice clear, “I am 
going. I have something to do. 
But then I’ll come back.” 

Stefan Pashitch said, “I would 
not advise it, Paul Kosloff.” 

T T e took the shuttle to Belgrade 

A and th’en the international 
rocketplane to Greater Washing- 
ton. 

As He lobbed over, He called 

189 



John Smith on the teevee phone. 

Smith seemed flabbergasted to 
see Him so soon again, but before 
he could comment, Paul said, 
“I’m on the rocketplane. Some- 
thing special .has come up. 
I have to report in person.” 
Smith glared at him. “Some- 
thing special! Are you complete- 
ly around the bend? You were 
under orders to stay in Common 
Eur-Asia for a full year.” 
“Something special,” Paul said 
doggedly. “Can you meet me at 
my apartment?” 

John Smith rolled his eyes up- 
ward, as though in appeal to 
higher powers. “All right.” 

J ohn Smith was not quite the 
smiling man he Had been less 
than a month ago when they Had 
first met. As soon as he confront- 
ed Paul in the Kosloff mini- 
apartment, he put his Hands on 
his Hips. 

“Well?” 

Paul looked at him quizzically, 
“I think we Had better go to the 
Octagon and see Harry Rank.” 
Smith said impatiently, “That’s 
not necessary. I’m the agent as- 
signed to your liaison man. I 
Handle everything that pertains to 
you. And Zoroaster knows, it’s 
proving a Headache.” 

Paul Kosloff shook his Head. “I 
think we Had better go to the 
Octagon and Have this out.” 
“No.” 


Paul grunted sour amusement. 
“You can’t go to the Octagon, 
can you, Mr. John Smith? Or 
should I call you Comrade 
Smith?” 

“Are you crazy?” 

“You can’t go to the Octagon, 
because you don’t belong there. 
You’re not connected with the In- 
ter-American Bureau of Investi- 
gation. Oh’, you’re police all rigEt, 
but you’re not American police. 
And you’re not an American.” 

“OH, wizard,” John Smith said 
sarcastically. “So I’m not an 
American.” 

Paul said, in self-deprecation, “I 
should have guessed sooner. My 
first hint was when you didn’t 
understand my pig-latin. Every 
American kid learns pig-latin, but 
you didn’t understand it wfien 
I told you that I thought my cov- 
er was already blown. 

“But the real realization came 
to me when some of my Yugo- 
slavian friends accused me of be- 
ing a police spy. And I suddenly 
knew they were correct. There 
was only one reason in the world 
for the police turning me loose. 
They knew I was one of tHeirs, 
after an initial searcK of my Hotel 
rooms to double-check my identi- 
ty. I didn’t know it, at the time, 
but I was a police spy, working 
for the Common Eur-Asian secret 
police. Planted to get inside in- 
formation about the underground. 
And what a plant! Who would 


190 


GALAXY 



suspect an American relative, who 
Had never been in Europe before, 
to be a member of the secret 
police?’' 

John Smith had been standing 
near the built in bureau drawers 
of the mini-apartment. In a fluid 
motion, he opened the top draw- 
er with his left hand, dipped in 
with his right and brought forth 
the .38 Recoiless which had once 
belonged to Paul’s father. 

He was a smiling man again. 
He said softly, “Your own gun. 
With a built-in silencer. This 
speeds things up a bit, but the 
end result is what it was always 
going to be, Paul Kosloff.” 

“I figured that out, too,” Paul 
said bitterly. “After I returned 
from my year of spying, you were 
not going to give me any ten 
shares of Variable Basic, as 
your plant in the Octagon, 
Harry Kank, told me. You were 
going to get my information, for- 
ward it to your police superiors 
in Common Eur-Asia and finish 
me off.” 

-The self-named John Smith 
jiggled the gun humorously. “You 
would be surprised how near the 
truth you've hit, Paul, old chum- 
pal. However, it hasn’t done you 
much good.” 

Paul snorted contempt. “You 
should have checked to see if that 
gun was loaded before you made 
any admission, Smith.” 

The other shot a glance down 


at the weapon in his hand. 

Paul screamed the Kiai yell, 
“SUT!" and was on him. 

He went into the Twelfth Ka- 
ta, slugging the other’s right in- 
side arm with a hard wrist blow 
with his left hand. He grabbed 
Smith’s arms with a reverse arm- 
lock, and the gun went off into 
the floor. Paul came in with’ an 
Okinawa fist, thumb side of the 
fist pointed upward slamming in- 
to the other’s groin. As his oppon- 
ent began to go down, eyes blaz- 
ing in agony, with his right hand, 
knuckles up, Paul came up fast 
and hard with a knuckle blow 
under his chin. Simultaneously, 
he turned his hand, knuckles 
down, now, and came down with 1 
all His body weight against the 
other’s collarbone. 

VII 

P aul Kosloff sat in the office of 
Harry Kank and looked at 
the other for a long moment, 
wondering how to begin. 

He said finally, “Did you really 
know my father?” 

The other man said, “Yes.” 
“Then you’ve obviously been 
in this bureau for a long rime. I 
wonder how many others you set 
up for your John Smith to send 
over to Common Eur-Asia to be- 
tray their relatives.” 

Kank shifted slightly in his 
chair, and his cold eyes narrowed,

but for the moment fie field His 
peace. 

Paul said tfiougfitfully, "It 
must Have been fairly difficult to 
arrange, through tfie Bureau of 
Labor Draft. $Jow tfiat I think 
about it, wfien I was first inter- 
viewed by tfiat Labor Draft of- 
ficial, Banning, fie mentioned tfiat 
th'ere was something unusual in 
my being called up. And, I sup- 
pose, there’s a certain awe tfiat 
pertains wfien you mention tfie 
Inter- American Bureau of Inves- 
tigation. Sometfiing like tfie FBI 
in tfie old days. FlasH an FBI 
badge and people would let you 
get away witfi anything.” 

Harry Kank said, “I Haven’t 
the vaguest idea of wfiat you’re 
talking about, Paul.” 

“Mr. Kosloff to you, Comrade 
Kank.” 

“I’m not a communist.” 

“Worse. You’re a tool of theirs. 
If you were an Honest, dedicated 
communist, tfiat would be one 
thing, but, obviously, you’ve 
merely sold out to tfiem.” 

Tfie other came to a quick de- 
cision. “See here, Kosloff. The 
United States of the Americas is 
not being Hurt by this operation. 
Admittedly, this is a Common 
Eur-Asian police matter. They 
want inside information about 
the underground in their coun- 
try. Why should we care? There’s 
a good deal of money involved 
in this Kosloff. The secret po- 

192 


lice over there have plenty of 
resources and are willing to 
pay off. Why shouldn’t you get 
in on the gravy?” 

Paul said, “You said you knew 
my father. Would He Have?” 

“I also said your father Bad a 
one-track mind.” 

“But I don’t think He would 
have betrayed a friend or rela- 
tive for the sake of money, Kank. 
Let’s face reality. You’re a dou- 
ble agent, working with the Com- 
mon Eur-Asian secret police. How 
they got to you, I don’t know. 
But the game is up, Kank.” 

The other man drew in a deep 
breath’, reached into a drawer of 
His desk and emerged with a 
Heavy automatic, which He train- 
ed on Paul Kosloff. 

He said flatly, “I know your 
record in judo, Kosloff. Don’t 
try anything. Now I’m going to 
give you one last chance. Come 
in with me, and I’ll see you’re 
paid off handsomely. Don’t and 
you’re a dead Hombre.” 

“Do you think I’m a complete 
fool? Before I came in here, 
Kank, I got in touch’ with your 
superiors.” 

He smiled slowly, "Besides, it’s 
simply not in the cards for me 
to die at the hands of a corrupt 
police official. You see, she 
doesn’t know it, but I’ve got a 
date back in Split with a girl 
named Goldi.”

GALAXY’S STARS 


Fritz Leiber, whose One Sta- 
tion of the Way adds a sort of 
Christmasy note to this issue, has 
recently acquired a new Hugo for 
His trophy shelf. At the 1968 
World Science Fiction Conven- 
tion, he won the novelette award 
for His story, Gonna Roll The 
Bones, adding it to the two pre- 
viously acquired for his novels, 
The Big Time (originally pub- 
lished in Galaxy ) and The Wan- 
derer. A resident of Venice, Cali- 
fornia, Leiber mixes writing sci- 
ence fiction with championship 
chess, studying such primitive 
art forms as the Watts towers and 
an omnivorous interest in almost 
everything. 

John WyndHam (A Life Post- 
poned) is best known to science- 
fiction readers for such novels as 
The Day of the T riff ids, possibly 
the single most widely read sci- 
ence-fiction novel in recent his- 
tory, and The Midwieh Cuckoos, 
made into a motion picture as 
Village of the Damned. But the 
“Wyndham” personality marks a 
second career in science-fiction for 
this durable and protean writer. 
Nearly four decades ago, under 
his real name of John Beynon 
Harris and such foreshortened 
versions of it as “John Beynon”, 
Wyndham was the prolific au- 
thor of 1930-vintage space opera 
for the American sf magazines.

Today Wyndham lives in the 
south of England, on the out- 
skirts of the charming village of 
Petersfield. 

Poul Anderson lives in the hills 
just north of San Francisco, where 
he is a charter member of that 
celebrated science-fiction group, 
the Elves, Gnomes and Little 
Men’s Literary, Chowder and 
Marching Society, whose other 
members included 1 Jack Vance, 
Reg Bre tnor, the late Tony 
Boucher and many other illus- 
trious persons. With Vance and 
Frank Herbert, Anderson was for 
some time the co -proprietor of a 
home-built houseboat on which 
they intended to voyage to dis- 
tant lands. The plan came to a 
bad end; the houseboat sank at 
its mooring. But most of Ander- 
son’s ventures do better — as 
witness The Sharing of Flesh in 
this issue. 

Raymond F. Jones has been
