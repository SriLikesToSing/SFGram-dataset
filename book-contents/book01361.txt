Do you have 
a restless urge 
to write? 



If you do, here is an opportunity 
for you to take the first 
important step to success in writing 




Bennett Cerf, the distinguished 
publisher, is a member of 
the Guiding Faculty of 
the Famous Writers School. 



There’s something different about peo- 
ple who feel the urge to write. They have 
a spiritual hunger that sets them apart — 
even from family and friends. 

If you have known this burning need 
to write, you, too, may have the gift suc- 
cessful authors possess. 

They know that this restless urge for 
self-expression is perhaps the most im- 
portant ingredient of writing success. 
But, they realize it can waste away if 
you don’t know how to get started writ- 
ing, or if you hesitate to try. 

Several years ago a group of famous 
authors including Rod Serling, Faith 
Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, 
and several others joined forces to start 
the Famous Writers School. They poured 
everything they know about writing into 
a remarkable new kind of professional 
training course which trains you at home 
in your spare time. You begin with the 
fundamentals of all good writing. Then 
you get advanced training in the specialty 
of your choice. 

Each of your assignments is examined 
by an instructor who is a professional 
writer or editor. He goes pver your work 
word by word, blue-penciling changes 
right on your manuscript. Then he re- 
turns it to you with a long letter of ad- 



vice on how to improve your writing. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to hundreds of 
publications. 

Free Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you, too, have writing 
ability worth developing, send for the 
School’s revealing Aptitude Test. If you 
test well, or offer other evidence of writ- 
ing aptitude — you may enroll. However, 
there is no obligation to do so.

arranging reservations, packing 
luggage, carrying it out to the car 
and driving to the airport, I will 
engage myself in the important 
business of oiling my fountain pen 
and setting down these notes. 

You’ve never been to a science- 
fiction convention before, have 
you, my little Diary? I can tell, 
because you are so clean and 
spotless and undamaged — as fresh 
as the day I stole you from the 
dime store. After this convention 
you will look different, believe 
me. 

What is a World Science Fic- 
tion Convention? Well, it’s not a 
regional convention, where sci- 
ence-fiction fans foregather with 
writers and editors and publishers 
and artists from their own section 
of the country. The World Con- 
vention is big. It draws attend- 
ance from all over the United 
States, Canada, Europe and Asia. 
It’s an annual affair, sponsored 
by a fan group located in a city 
which won a bid to stage the get- 
together at the previous conven- 
tion. 

This year the World-Con is 
being held in ' St. Louis, and 
that’s where we’re heading. So 
fasten your seat-belt, dear diary, 
and off we go. Cooperate by re- 
cording the words I put down in 
you and I promise you’ll wind up 
immortaliz^ in the pages of // 
magazine, right next to some 
Jack Gaughan' artwork. 

Trust me.

Later. 

The first pro I met on the 
flight was Joyce Muscat. The 
first fan, Alan Foster, who sat 
with my wife and myself during 
the flight. I spent most of my time 
talking with Alan while my wife 
read Nicholas And Alexander, 
the biography of the Czar of 
Russia and his Empress. I guess 
she thinks that learning about 
riots, revolutions and assassina- 
tions is good preparation for the 
Convention. 

Somewhere along the line they 
served us breakfast. 

“These must be powdered 
eggs,” Alan told me. 

I nodded. 

“What else do you expect from 
powdered chickens?” I inquired. 

As Alan digested this bit of im- 
peccable logic — along with his 
eggs — ^we began our descent upon 
St. Louis. The first sight of the 
city from the air came as some- 
thing of a surprise to me. I’ve 
heard o( the St\ Louis Blues, but 
St. Louis actually looks green; 
at least from a height of ten thou- 
sand feet. And so do I. 

At ground level the city is hot 
and humid. We made our way to 
the Chase-Park Plaza Hotel apd 
discovered that it’s really two 
hotels connected by a hyphen — 
and a passageway from the lobby 
of one to the elevator bank of the 
other. Getting from room to room- 
is going to mean a lot of walking

FRANK HERBERT 



No one had ever seen a Caleban. 
And now McKie had to love one! 



WHIPPING 



F URUNEO was his name. Ali- 
chino Furuneo. He had re- 
minded himself of this on the ride 
into the city to make the long-dis- 
tance call — he clung to his identity 
now. It was wise to firm up the ego 
under the circumstances. He was 
sixty-seven years old and could re- 
member many who had lost their 
selves in the sniggertrance of com- 
munication between star systems. 



But more than the cost and the 
mind-crawling sensation of dealing 
with a Taprisiot transmitter, was at 
stake here — and, Furuneo did not 
feel he could trust anyone else to 
speak to Jorj X. McKie. 

He stood — ^with the two enforc- 
ers he had brought along to guard 
his privacy — in the reception room 
of the Taprisiot breeding center — 
one of only about twenty known to 




STAR 



exist in the universe. The room was 
no more than fifteen meters wide, 
perhaps thirty-five long. Its tan 
walls were oddly, randomly pitted. 
A high bench occupied three - 
fourths of one long wall. Multi- 
faceted rotating lights above it cast 
patterned shadows onto the bench 
and the Taprisiot on it. 

Taprisiots came in odd shapes 
like sawed off lengths of burned 



conifers, stub limbs jutting every 
which way, needlelike speech ap- 
pendages fluttering even when the 
creatures remained silent. This 
one’s skidfeet beat a nervous 
rhythm on the bench. 

For the third time since entering, 
Furuneo asked, “Are you the 
transmitter?” 

No answer. 

Taprisiots were like that. One of 



5 



the enforcers behind Furuneo 
cleared his throat. 

“Looks like it’s gonna be a long 
wait for this Tappy.” 

Furuneo nodded. He had 
learned several degrees of patience 
on his way up the ladder to his 
present {Msition as Planetary 
Agent for the Bureau of Sabotage. 
He knew his only recourse now was 
to wait quietly. Taprisipts took 
their own time about anything and 
everything — and without a Tapri- 
siot transmitter one did not make 
real-time calls across interstellar 
space. 

Strange, this Taprisiot talent — 
the sensational press abounded 
with theories on how they com- 
municated. Furuneo’s belief was 
that Taprisiots distorted space in a 
way similar to that of a Caleban 
jumpdoor, sliding^ between the di- 
mensions. But whatever Taprisiots 
did to make a call, one thing was 
certain — it involv^ the human 
pineal gland or the equivalent 
among other sentients. 

“Putcha, putcha, putcha,’’ the 
Taprisiot on the bench said, 
squeaking its speech needles. 

Furuneo asked again, “Are you 
the transmitter?” 

“Putcha, putcha, putcha,” the 
Taprisiot repeated. “This is a re- 
mark I will now translate in the 
only way that may make sense to 
ones like yourselves of Sol /Earth 
ancestry. What I said was: ‘I ques- 
tion your sincerity.’ ” 

F uruneo moved to a position 
below the bench. 

“1 wish to make a call to Sabo- 
teur Extraordinary Jorj X. Mc- 

6 



Kie,” he said. “Your robogreeter 
recognized and identified me and 
took my creditchit. Are you the 
transmitter?” 

“Where is this Jorj X. McKie?” 
the Taprisiot asked. 

“If I knew. I’d be off to him in 
person through a Jumpdoor,” Fu- 
runeo said. “This is an important 
call. Are you the transmitter?” 

“Date, time and place,” the 
Taprisiot requested. 

Furuneo sighed and relaxed. He 
glanced back at his enforcers, mo- 
tioned them to take up stations at 
the room’s two doors, waited while 
they obeyed. From here on he 
wanted no outside interruptions. 
He turned back, gave thd Taprisiot 
the required local coordinates. 

“You will sit on floor,” the crea- 
ture said. 

Furuneo silently thanked his 
stars. Once a transmitter had led 
him to a mountainside in wind and 
driving rain and made him stretch 
out, head lower than feet, before 
opening the overspace contact. It 
had had something to do with “re- 
fining the imbediQent.” 

Furuneo sat. 

“Close eyes,” the Taprisiot 
squeaked. 

Furuneo obeyed. 

“Think of contact,” the Tapri- 
siot ordered. 

Furuneo thought of Jorj X. Mc- 
Kie, building the image in his 
mind — squat little man, angry red 
hair, face like a disgruntled frog. 

Contact began -with tendrils of 
cloying awareness. Furuneo be- 
came in his owa mind a red flow 
sung to the tune of a silver lyre. 
His body went remote. Awareness 



IF 




rotated above a strange landscape, 
its horizons slowly turning. He 
sensed the stars engulfed in lonli> 
ness. 

What the ten million devils! 

The thought exploded in Furu- 
neo’s awareness. He recognized it 
at once. Contactees frequently re- 
sented the call. They could not re- 
ject it, no matter how inopportune 
the timing — but they could make 
the caller feel their displeasure. 

It never Jails! It never Jails! 

McKie would be jerked to full 
inner awareness now, his pineal 
gland ignited by the long-distance 
contact. 

Furuneo settled himself to wait 
out the curses. When they had sub- 
sided sufficiently he identified him- 
self. 

regret any inconvenience I 
may have caus^,” he said. “But 
the max-alert failed to say where 
you could be located.- You must 
know I would not have called un- 
less it were important.” 

A more or less standard open- 
ing. 

“How the hell do I know wheth- 
er your call’s important?” McKie 
demanded. “Stop babbling and 
get on with it.” 

This was an unusfual extension 
of anger even for the volatile Mc- 
Kie. “Am I interrupting something 
important?” 

“I’m standing here in a Teli- 
court, getting a divorce,” McKie 
said. “Can you imagine what a 
great time everyone here’s having, 
watching me mumble to myself in 
a sniggertrance? Get to the busi- 
ness.’’ 

“A Caleban Beachball washed 



ashore last night below Division 
City here on Cordiality,” Furuneo 
said. “In view of all the deaths and 
insanity and the max-alert from 
the Bureau, I thought I’d better 
call you at once. It’s still your case, 
isn’t it?” 

“Is this your idea of a joke?” 
McKie demanded. 

In lieu oj red tape^ Furuneo cau- 
tioned himself, thinking of the 
Bureau maxim. It was a private 
thought, but McKie no doubt was 
catching the mood of it. 

“Well?” McKie demanded. 

Was McKie deliberately trying 
to unnerve him? Furuneo won- 
dered. How could the Bureau’s 
prime function — to slow the pro- 
cesses of government — remain 
operative on an internal matter 
such as this call? Agents were duty 
bound to encourage anger in gov- 
ernment in order to expose the un- 
stable, tempermental types, the 
ones who lacked the necessary per- 
sonal control and ability to think 
under psychic stress — but why 
carry this duty over to a call from a 
fellow agent? 

Some of these thoughts obvious- 
ly bled through the Taprisiot trans- 
mitter because McKie reflected 
them, enveloping Furuneo in a 
mental sneer. 

“You lotsa time unthink your- 
self,” McKie said.^ 

Furuneo shuddered, recovered 
his sense of self. He recognized a 
close call — he had almost lost his 
ego. ,The veiled warning in Mc- 
Kie’s words had alerted him, allow- 
ing recovei7. Furuneo began cast- 
ing about in his mind for another 
Interpretation of McKie’s reac-

tion. Interrupting the divorce 
could not account for it. If the 
stories were true, the ugly little 
agent had been married fifty or 
more times. 

**Are you still interested in the 
Beachball?” Furuneo venturi. 

“Is there a Caleban in it?” 

“Presumably.” 

“You haven’t investigated?” 

McKie’s tone suggested Fur- 
uneo had been entrusted with a 
most crucial operation and had 
failed because of inherent stu- 
pidity. 

Now fully alert, Furuneo said, 
“I acted as my orders instructed.” 

“Orders!” 

“I’m supposed to be angry, isn’t 
that right?” 

“I’ll be there as fast as I can get 
service — within eight standard 

hours at the most,” McKie said. 
“Your orders, meanwhile, are to 
keep that Beachball under con- 
stant observation. The observers 
must be hopped up on angeret, It^s 
their only protection.” 

“Constant observation,” Furu- 
neo said. 

“If a Caleban emerges, you’re 
to detain it by any means possi- 
ble,” 

“A Caleban — detain it?” 

“Engage it in conversation, re- 
quest its cooperation — anything,” 
McKie said. 

His mental emphasis added that 
it was odd a Bureau agent should 
have to ask about throwing a mon- 
key wrench into someone’s activi- 
ties. 

“Eight hours,” Furuneo said. 

“And don’t forget the angeret'' 
he repeated. 



M CKIE, on the honeymoon 
planet of Tutalsee, took an 
hour to complete his divorce, then 
returned to the float home he had 
moored beside the island of love 
flowers. Even the nepenthe of 
Tutalsee had failed him, McKie 
thought. His marriage had been 
wasted effort — this wife had^been 
his fifty-fourth, somewhat lighter 
of skin than any of the others and 
more than a bit of a shrew. It had 
not been her first marriage and she 
had shown early suspicions of Mc- 
Kie’s secondary motives. 

She had already vacated the 
float home and McKie could sense 
the living entity’s resentment. He 
had shattered the idyl the float 
home had been conditioned to 
create — the home would return to 
its former affability only when he, 
too, was gone. The floats were 
gentle creatures, susceptible to 
sentient irritation. 

McKie packed. He examined his 
toolkit — a selection of stims, plas- 
tipicks, explosives in various de- 
nominations, raygens, multigog- 
gles, pentrates, a wad of uniflesh, 
solvos,- miniputer, Taprisiot life 
monitor, holoscan blanks, rupters, 
comparators all in order. The tool- 
kit was a fitted wallet — he con- 
cealed it in an inner pocket of his 
jacket. 

He stowed a few changes of 
clothing into a single bag, con- 
signed the rest of his possessions to 
BuSab storage, left them for pick- 
up in a sealpack on a couple of 
chairdogs. They appeared to share 
the float home’s resentment. They 
remained immobile even when he 
patted them affectionately.

IF 




Too bad. 

McKie sighed, took out his S’eye 
key. This jump was going to cost 
the Bureau megacredits. Cordial- 
ity lay halfway across the universe. 

Jumpdoors still seemed to be 
working all right but it disturbed 
McKie that he must make this 
journey by a means the Calebans 
had provided. Eerie situation. 
S'eye jumpdoors had become so 
common that mqst sentients ac- 
cepted them without question. 
McKie had even shared the com- 
mon acceptance before the max- 
alert. Now he wondered at himself. 
Casual acceptance demonstrated 
the adaptability of rational thought 
— a common characteristic of all 
sentients. The Caleban artifact 
had been known to the Confeder- 
ated Sentients for only nineteen 
standard years. But in that time 
exactly eighty- three Calebans 
were known to have contacted 
Consent — the first one with his 
gift of the jumpdoor. And eighty- 
two others. 

McKie flipped the key in his 
hand, caught it deftly. 

Why had the Calebans refused 
to part with their gift unless every- 
one agreed to call it S’eye? What 
was so important about a name? 

I should be on my way, McKie 
told himself. Still, he delayed. 

Eighty-three Calebans. 

The max-alert had been explicit 
in its demand for secrecy regarding 
the outlined problem — Calebans 
had been disappearing, one by 
one. Disappearing — if that was 
what the phenomenon could be 
called. Each disapp>earance had 
been accompanied by a massive 



wave of sentient deaths and in- 
sanity. 

No question why the problem 
had been dumped in BuSab’s lap 
instead of onto some police agency. 
Government fought back wherever 
it could — powerful men hoped to 
discredit BuSab. McKie found his 
own share of disturbance in won- 
dering about the hidden possibil- 
ities in the selection of himself as 
the sentient to tackle this. 

Who hates me? 

He used his personally tuned 
key in the jumpdoor. The door be- 
gan to hum with its aura of terrify- 
ing energies. Its vortal tube snap- 
py open. McKie tensed himself 
for the syrupy resistance to jump- 
door passage, stepped through the 
tube. It was like swimming in air 
become molasses — perfectly nor- 
mal appearing air. 

M CKIE found himself in a 
rather ordinaiy office — the 
usual humdrum whirldesk, alert- 
flicker light patterns cascading 
from the ceiling, a view out one 
transparent wall onto a mountain- 
side. In the distance the rooftops 
of Division City lay beneath dull 
gray clouds. A luminous silver sea 
stretched to' the horizon beyond. 
McKie’s implanted brainclock told 
him the time was late afternoon, 
the eighteenth hour of the twenty- 
six-hour day. This was Cordiality, 
a world two hundred thousand 
light-years from Tutalsee’s plane- 
tary ocean. 

The jumpdoor’ s vortal tube 
snapped shut behind him with a 
crackling sound like the discharge 
of electricity. A faint ozone smell 



WHIPPING STAR 



9 




was detectable in the room. 

The room’s standard-model 
chairdogs had been well trained to 
comfort their masters, McKie 
noted. One of them nudged him 
behind the knees until he dropped 
his bag and took a reluctant seat. 
The chairdog began massaging his 
back. Obviously it had t^n in- 
structed to make him comfortable 
while someone was summoned. 

McKie tun^ himself to the faint 
sounds of normalcy around him. 
Footsteps of a sentient could be 
heard in an outer passage. A 
Wreave by the sound of it — the 
peculiar dragging of the heel on a 
favored foot. A conversation was 
going on somewhere — McKie 
could make out a few -Lingua- 
galach words. 

His fidgeting set the chairdog 
into a burst of rippling movements 
to soothe him. Enforced idleness 
nagged at him. Where was Furu- 
neo? McKie chided himself. Furu- 
neo probably had many planetary 
duties as BuSab agent here. And 
he could not know the full urgency 
of the problem. This might be one 
of the planets where BuSab. was 
spread thin. The gods of immor- 
tality knew the Bureau could al- 
ways find work. 

McKie began reflecting on his 
role in the affairs of sentiency. 
Once, long centuries past. Con- 
sents with a psychological com- 
pulsion to “do good” had cap- 
tured the government. Unaware of 
the writhing complexities — the 
mingled guilts and self-punish- 
ments beneath their compulsion — 
they had eliminated virtually all 
delays and red tape from govern- 



ment. The great machine with ^ts 
blundering power over sentient life 
had slipp^ into high gear, moved 
faster and faster. Laws had been 
conceived and passed in the same 
hour. Appropriations had flashed 
into being and were spent in a fort- 
night. New bureaus for the most 
improbable purposes had lea|^ 
into existence and proliferated like 
some insane fungus. 

Governnient had become a great 
destructive wheel without a gover- 
nor, whirling with such frantic 
speed that it spread chaos wher- 
ever it touched. 

In desperation a handful of sen- 
tients had conceived the Sabotage 
Corps to slow that wheel. There 
had been bloodshed and other de- 
grees of violence but the wheel had 
been slowed. In time the Corps had 
become a Bureau, and the Bureau 
was whatever it was today — an or- 
ganization headed into its own cor- 
ridors of entropy, a group of sen- 
tients who preferred subtle diver- 
sion to violence but were prepared 
for violence when the need arose. 

A DOOR slid back on McKie’s 
right. His chairdog became 
still. Furuneo entered, b^rushing a 
hand through the band of gray hair 
at his left ear. His wide mouth was 
held in a straight line, a suggestion 
of sourness about it. 

“You’re early,” he said, patting 
a chairdog into place across from 
McKie and seating himself. 

“Is this place safe?” McKie 
asked. He glanced at the wall 
where the S’ eye had disgorged 
him. The jumpdoor was gone. 

“I’ve moved the door back 



10 




downstairs through its own tube,” 
Furuneo said. “This place is as 
private as 1 can make it.” 

He sat back, waiting for McKie 
to explain. 

McKie nodded toward the trans- 
parent wall and the distant sea. 

“That Beachball still down 
there?” 

“My men have orders to call me 
it makes any move,” Furuneo 
said. “It washed ashore just like I 
said, imbedded itself in a rock out- 
cropping and hasn’t moved since.” 
“Imbedded itself?” 

“That’s how it seems.” ’ 

“No sign of anything in it?” 
“Not that we can see. The Ball 
does appear to be a bit — banged 
up — some pitting and a few exter- 
nal scars. What’s this all about?” 
“No doubt you’ve heard of Mliss 
Abnethe?” 

“Who hasn’t?” 

“She recently spent some of her 
quintillions to hire a Caleban.” 
“Hire a — ” Furuneo shook his 
head. “I didn’t know it could be 
done.” 

“Neither did anyone else.” 

“I read the max-alert,” Furuneo 
said. “Abnethe’s connection with 
the case wasn’t explained.”— 
“She’s a bit kinky about flog- 
gings, you know.” 

“I thought she was treated for 
that.” 

“Yeah, but it didn’t eliminate 
the root of her problem. It just 
fixed her so she couldn’t stand the 
sight of a sentient suffering.” 

“So?” 

“Her solution, naturally, was to 
hire a Caleban.” 

“As victim?” 



Furuneo was beginning to un- 
derstand, McKie saw. Someone 
had once said the problem with 
Calebans was that they presented 
no patterns yoii could recognize. 
This was true, of course. If you 
could imagine an actuahty, a being 
whose presence could not be denied 
but who left your senses dangling 
every time you tried to look at it — 
then you could imagine a Caleban. 

They’re shuttered windows 
opening onto eternity . 

McKie had attended every Bur- 
eau lecture and briefing about 
Calebans. He tried to recall one of 
those sessions now, prompted by a . 
nagging sensation that it had con- 
tained something of value to his 
present problem. It’d been some- 
thing about “communications dif- 
ficulties within an aura of afflic- 
tion.” The precise content eluded 
him. Odd, he thought. It was as 
though the Calebans’ crumbled 
projection created an effect on senr 
tieht memoiy akin to their effect 
on sentient vision. 

Here lay the true source of sen- 
tient uneasiness about Calebans. 
Their artifacts were real — the 
S’eye jumpdoors, the Beachballs in 
which they were reputed to live — 
but no one had ever really seen a 
Caleban. 

F uruneo, .watching the fat 
little gnome of an agent sit 
there thinking, recalled the snide 
story about McKie, that he’d been 
in BuSab since the day before he 
was born. 

“She’s hired a whipping boy, 
eh?” Furuneo asked. 

“That’s about it.”

‘The max-alert spoke of deaths, 
insanity — ” 

“Are all your people dosed with 
angeretT^ McKie asked. 

“I got the message, McKie.” 
“Good. Anger seems to afford 
some protection.” 

“What exactly is going on?” 
“Calebans have been — vanish- 
ing,” McKie said. “Every time one 
of them goes, there are quite a few 
deaths and other unpleasant ef- 
fects — physical and mental crip- 
pling, insanity — ” 



Furuneo nodded in the direction 
of the sea. 

McKie shrugged. 

“We’ll have to go take a look. 
The hell of it is, until your call 
there seemed to be only one Caleb- 
an left in the universe, the one 
Abnethe hired.” - 
“How’re you going to handle 
this?” 

“That’s a beautiful question.” 
“Abnethe’s Caleban,” Furuneo 
said. ‘‘Does it have anything to say 
by way of explanation?”

“Haven’t been able to interview 
it,” McKie said. “We don’t know 
where she’s hidden herself — or it.” 
“Really don’t know?” Furuneo 
blinked. “Well, cordiality is pretty 
much of a backwater.” 

“That’s what I’ve been thinking. 
You said this Beachball was a little 
the worse for wear?” 

“That’s 0^, isn’t it.” 

“Another oddity among many.” 
McKie frowned. 

“They say a Caleban doesn’t get 
very far from its Ball,” Furuneo 



said. “And they like to park them 
near water.” 

“How much of an attempt did 
you make to communicate?” 

“The usual. HowM you find out 
about Abnethe hiring a Caleban?” 
“She bragged to a friend who 
bragg^ to a friend who — and one 
of the other Calebans dropped a 
hint before disappearing.” 

“Any doubt the disappearances 
and the rest of it are tied together?” 
“Let’s go knock on this thing’s 
door and find out,” McKie said.

M OKIE’S immediate ex-wife 
had adopted an early atti- 
tude of resentment toward BuSab. 

“They use you,” she had pro- 
tested. 

McKie considered her words 
now as he and Furuneo sped by 
groundcar toward the Cordiality 
coast. 

How arc they using me this time? 
Setting aside the possibility that 



he had been offered up as a sacri- 
fice, many possibilities remained 
in reserve. Was his legal training 
needed? Or had the assignment 
been prompted by his unorthodox 
approach to inter-spedes relation- 
ships? Obviously they entertained 
some hope for a spedal sort of offi- 
cial sabotage — but what sort? Why 
had his instructions been so in- 
complete?

McKie shook his head. 

“Why did they choose you for

“They know how to use me,” 
McKie said. 

The groundcar, driven by an en- 
forcer, negotiated a sharp turn and 
a vista of rocky shore opened be-

the distance among black lava 
palisades. McKie noted two air- 
craft hovering above the rocks. 

“That it?” he asked. 

“Yes.”

“I sincerely hope so,” McKie 
said. ‘*Why didn't you bring us 
by aircar?” 

“People here on Cordiality are 
used to seeing me in a groundcar 
unless I'm on official business and 
require speed.” 

“You mean nobody knows 
about this thing yet?” 

“Just the coastwatchers for this 
stretch. And they're on my pay- 
roll.” 

“You run a pretty tight opera- 
tion here,” McKie said. “Aren't 
you afraid of becoming too effi- 
cient?” 

“I do my best,” Furuneo said. 
He tapped the driver's shoulder. 
The groundcar pulled to a stop at a 
turnaround which looked down on- 
to a reach of rocky islands and a 
low lava shelf where the Caleban 
Beachball had come to rest. “You 
know, I keep wondering if we real- 
ly know what those Beachballs 
are ” 

“They’re homes,” McKie 
grunted. 

“So everybody says.” 

Furuneo got out. A cold wind 
set his hip aching. 

“We walk from here,” he said. 



T here were times during the 
climb down the narrow path to 
the lava shelf when McKie felt 
thankful he had been fitted with a 
gravity web beneath his skin. It 
would limit his rate of descent to a 
non-injurious speed if he fell. But 
it could do nothing about any beat- 
ing he might receive in the surf at 
the base of the palisades and it of- 
fered no protection at all against 

16 



the chill wind and the driving 
spray. 

He wished he "had worn a heat- 
suit. 

“It’s colder than I expected,” 
Furuneo said, limping out onto the 
lava shelf. 

He waved to the aircars. One 
dipped its wings, maintained its 
place in a slow circling track above 
the Beachball. 

Furuneo struck out across the 
shelf and McKie follow^, jumped 
across a tidal pool, blinked and 
bent his head against a gust of 
windborne spray. The pounding of 
the surf on the rocks was loud 
here. They had to raise their voices 
to make themselves understood. 

“You see?” Furuneo shouted. 
“Looks like it’s been . banged 
around a bit.” 

“Those things are supposed to 
be indestructible,” McKie said. 

The Beachball was some six 
meters in diameter. It sat solidly 
on the shelf, about a half meter of 
its bottom surface hidden by a de- 
pression in the rock, as though it 
had melted out a resting place. 

McKie led the way up to the lee 
of the Ball, passing Furuneo in the 
last few meters. He stood there, 
hands in pockets, shivering. The 
round surface of the Ball failed to 
cut off the cold wind. 

“It’s bigger than I expected,” 
he said as Furuneo stopped. 

“First one you’ve ever seen close 
up?” 

“Yeah.” 

McKie passed his gaze across 
the thing. Knobs and indentations 
marked the opaque metallic sur- 
face. It seemed to him the surface 



IF 




variations carried some pattern. 
Sensors, perhaps? Controls of 
some kind? Directly in front of him 
was what appeared to be a crackled 
mark, perhaps from a collision. It 
lay just below the surface, present- 
ing no roughness to McKie's ex- 
ploring hand. 

“What if they’re wrong about 
these things?” Furuneo asked. 

“How?” 

“What if they aren’t Caleban 
homes?” 

“Don’t know. Do you recall the 
drill?” 

“You find a nippled extrusion 
and you knock on it. We tried that. 
There’s one just around to your 
left.” 

McKie worked his way around 
in that direction, getting drenched 
by a wind-driven shower of spray 
in the process. He reached up, still 
shivering from the cold, knocked 
at the indicated extrusion. 

Nothing happened. 

“Every briefing I ever attended 
says there’s a door in these things 
somewhere,” McKie grumbled. 

“But they don’t say the door 
opens every time you knock,” Fu- 
runeo said. 

McKie continued working his 
way aroutid the Ball, found an- 
other nippled extrusion, knocked. 

Nothing. 

“We tried that one, too,” Furu- 
neo said. 

“I feel like a damn fool.” 

“Maybe there’s nobody home.” 

“Remote control?” 

“Or abandoned — a derelict.” 

McKie pointed to a thin green 
line about a meter long on the 
Ball’s windward surface. 



“What’s that?” 

Furuneo hunched his shoulders 
against spray and wind, stared at 
the line. 

“Don’t recall seeing it.” 

“I wish we knew a lot more 
about these damn things.” 

“Maybe we aren’t knocking 
loud enough.” 

McKie pursed his lips^^ in 
thought. Presently, he took out his 
toolkit, extracted a lump of low- 
grade explosive. 

“Go back on the other side,” he 
said. 

“You sure you ought to try. 
that?” 

“No.” 

-Well—” , 

Furuneo shrugged, retreated 
around the Ball. 

McKie applied a strip of the ex- 
plosive along the green line, at- 
tached a time-thread, joined Furu- 
neo. 

Presently; there came a dull 
thump that was almost drowned 
by the surf. 

McKie felt an abrupt inner si- 
lence, found himself wondering: 
What if the Caleban gets angry 
and springs a weapon we*ve never 
heard of? 

He darted around to the wind- 
ward side. ' 

A n oval hole had appeared 
above the green line, as 
though a plug had been sucked 
into the Ball. 

“Guess you pushed the right 
button,” Furuneo said. 

McKie suppressed a feeling of 
irritation he knew to be mostly 
angeret effect.

“Yeah. Give me a leg up. Okay?” 

Funineo, he noted, was control- 
ling the drug reaction almost per- 
fectly. 

With Furuneo’s help, McKie 
clambered into the open port, 
stared inside. Dull purple light 
greeted him, a suggestion of move- 
ment within the dimness. 

“See anything?” Funineo called. 

“Don’t know.” McKie scram- 
bled inside, dropped to a canted 
floor. He crouch^, studied his sur- 
roundings in the purple glow. His 
teeth chattered from the cold. The 
room around him apparently oc- 
cupied the entire center of the Ball 
— low ceiling, flickering rainbows 
against the inner surface on his 
left, a giant soupspoon shape jut- 
ting into the room directly across 
from him, tiny spools, handles and 
knobs against the wall on his right. 

The sense of movement origi- 
nated in the spoon bowl. 

Abruptly, McKie realized he 
was in the presence of a Caleban. 

“What do you see?” Furuneo 
called. 

Without taking his gaze from 
the spoon, McKie turn^ his head 
slightly. 

“There’s a Caleban in here.” 

“Shall I come in?” 

“No. Tell your men and sit 
tight.” 

“Right.” 

McKie returned his full atten- 
tion to the bowl of the spoon. His 
throat felt dry. He had never be- 
fore been alone in the presence of a 
Caleban. This was a position usual- 
ly reserved for scientific investiga- 
tors armed with esoteric instru- 
ments. 



“I’m ah— Jorj X. McKie, Bu- 
reau of Sabotage,” he said. 

There was a stirring at the 
spoon, an effect of radiated mean- 
ing immediately behind the move- 
ment. 

I make your acquaintance, 

McKie found himself recalling 
Masarard’s poetic description in 
Conversation with a Caleban, 

Who can say how a Caleban 
speaks? Masarard had written. 
Their words come at you like the 
corruscating of a nine-ribbon So- 
jeu barber pole. The insensitive say 
such words radiate, I say the Cale- 
ban speaks. When words are sent, 
is that not speech? Send me your 
words, Caleban, and / will tell the 
universe of your wisdom. 

Having experienced the Cale- 
ban’s words, McKie decided Ma- 
sarard was a pretentious ass. The 
-Caleban radiated. Its communica- 
tion registered in the sentient mind 
as sound but the ears denied they 
had heard anything. It was the 
same order of effect Calebans had 
on the eyes. You felt you were see- 
ing something but the visual cen- 
ters refused to confirm. 

“I hope my — ah-^I didn’t dis- 
turb you.” 

I possess no referrent for disturb. 
You bring a companion?- 
“My companion’s outside.” 
Invite your companion, 

McKie hesitated, then: Furuneo. 
C’mon in.” 

The planetary agent joined him, 
crouched at McIGe’s left in the 
purple gloom. 

“Damn, that’s cold out there,” 
Furuneo said. 

Low temperature and much 

IF 



18 




moisture, the Caleban agreed. 

McKie, having turned to watch 
Furuneo enter, saw a closure ap- 
pear from the solid wail beside the 
open port. Wind, spray and surf 
were shut off. 

The temperature in the Ball be- 
gan to rise. 

“It’s going to get hot,” McKie 
said. 

“What?” 

“Hot. Remember the briefings? 
Calebans like their air hot and 
dry.” 

He already could feel his damp 
clothing begin to turn clammy 
against his skin. 

“That’s right,” Furuneo said. 
“What’s going on?” 

“We’ve been invited in,” McKie 
said. “We didn’t disturb him be- 
cause he has no referrent for dis- 
turb.” 

“Where is he?” 

“In that spoon thing.” 

“Yeah— I— uh— yeah.” 

You may address me as Fanny 
Mae, the Caleban said. / can re- 
produce my kind and answer the 
equivalents for female. 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie said with 
what he knew to be stupid vacuity. 
How could you look at the damn’ 
thing? Where was its face? “My 
companion is Alichino Furuneo, 
planetary agent on Cordiality for 
the Bureau of Sabotage.” 

I make your acquaintance, the 
Caleban said. Permit an inquiry 
into the purpose for your visit. 

Furuneo scratched his right ear. 

“How are we hearing it?” He 
shook his head. “I can understand 
it but — ” 

“Never mind,” McKie said. 



He warned himself; Gently, now. 
How do you question one of these 
things? The insubstantial Caleban 
presence, the twisting way his mind 
accepted the thing’s words — it all 
combined with the angeret in pro- 
ducing irritation. 

“I — my orders,” McKie said, 
“are to seek a Caleban employed 
by Mliss Abnethe.” 

I receive your questions, the 
Caleban said. 

M CKIE tried tipping his head 
from side to side, wondered 
if it were possible to achieve an 
angle of vision where the some- 
thing across from him would as- 
sume recognizable substance. 

“What are you doing?” Furuneo 
asked. 

“Trying to see it.” 

You seek visible substance? the 
Caleban asked. 

“Uh, yes,” McKie said. 

He was reminded of the original 
encounter with the Gowachin plan- 
ets, the first earth-human meeting 
the first froglike Gowachin and the 
Gowachin introducing himself as 
William. Where in ninety thousand 
worlds had the Caleban dug up the 
name Fanny Mae? And why? 

/ produce mirror, the Caleban 
said, which reflects outward from 
projection along plane of being, 
“Are we going to see it?” Fur- 
uneo whispered. “Nobody’s ever 
seen a Caleban.” 

“Quiet.” 

A half-meter oval something of 
green, blue and pink without ap- 
parent connection to the empty- 
presence of the Caleban material- 
ized above the giant spoon.

Think of ^is as stage upon 
which / present my seljdom, the 
Caleban said. 

“You see anything?” Furuneo 
asked. 

McKie’s visual centers conjured 
a borderline sensation, a feeling of 
distant life whose rhythms danced 
unfleshed within the colorful oval 
like the sea roaring in an empty 
shell. He recalled a one-eyed friend 
and the difficulty of focusing the 
attention on that lonely eye with- 
out being drawn to the vacant 
patch. 

“That’s the oddest thing I ever 
saw,” Furuneo whispered. “You 
see it?” 

McKie described his visual sen- 
sation. 

“That what you see?” 

“I guess so,” Furuneo said. 

Visual attempt fails, -the Cale- 
ban said. Perhaps I employ insuf- 
ficient contrast. 

Wondering if he could be mis- 
taken, McKie thought he detected 
a plaintive mood in the Caleban’s 
words. Was it possible Calebans 
disliked not being seen? 

“It’s fine,” McKie said. “Now 
may we discuss the Caleban 
who — ” 

Perhaps overlooking cannot be 
connected, the Caleban said, in- 
terrupting. We enter state for 
which there exists no remedy. ‘As 
well argue with the night,’ as your 
poets tell us. 

The sensation of an enormous 
sigh swept out from the Caleban 
ai^ over McKie. It was sadness, a 
doom-fire gloom. He wondered if 
he were experiencing an angeret 
failure. 



“You feel that?” Furuneo asked 
his companion. 

“Yes.” 

McKie felt his eyes burning. He 
blinked. Between blinks, he 
glimpsed a flower element hover- 
ing within the oval — deep red 
against the room’s purple, with 
black veins woven through it. 
Slowly it blossomed, closed, bios-' 
somed. He wanted to reach out, 
touch it with a handful of compas- 
sion. 

“How beautiful,” he whispered. 

“What js it?” Furuneo whis- 
pered. 

“I think we’re seeing a Cale- 
ban.” 

“I want to cry,” Furuneo said. 

“Control yourself, ” McKie cau- 
tioned. 

He cleared his throat. Twanging 
bits of emotion tunnbied through 
him. They were like pieces cut 
from the whole and loosed to seek 
their own patterns. The angeret 
effect was lost in the mixture. 

Slowly, the image in the oval 
faded. The emotional torrent sub- 
sided. 

Furuneo exhaled audibly. 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie ven- 
tured. “>^at was — ” 

I am one employed by Mliss 
Abnethe, the Caleban said. Cor- 
rect verb usage? 

“Bang,” Furuneo said. - “Just 
like that.” 

McKie glanced at him, at the 
place where they had entered the 
Ball. No sign remained of the oval 
hole. The heat in the room was be- 
coming unbearable. Correct verb 
usage? He looked at the Caleban 
manifestation. Something still 



20 



IF 




shimmered above the spoon shape 
but it defied his visual centers to 
describe it. 

“Was it asking a question?” Fu- 
runeo asked. 

“Be still a minute,” McKie 
snapped. “I want to think.” 

Seconds ticked past. Furuneo 
felt perspiration running down his 
neck, under his collar. He could 
taste it in the corners of his mouth. 

McKie sat stared silently at the 
giant spoon. The' Caleban em- 
ployed by Abnethe. He still felt 
the aftermath of the emotional 
melange. Some lost memory de- 
mand^ his attention bdt he could 
not bring it out for examination. 

Furuneo, watching McKie, be- 
gan to wonder if the'Saboteur Ex- 
traordinary had been mesmerized. 

“You still thinking?” he whis- 
pered. 

McKie nodded. 

Then; “Fanny Mae, where is 
your employer?” 

Coordinates not permitted, the 
Caleban said. 

“Is she on this planet?” 

Different connectives. 

“I don’t think you two are talk- 
ing the same language,” Furuneo 
said. 

“From everything I’ve read and 
heard about Calebans, that’s the 
big problem,” McKie said. “Com- 
munication difficulty.” 

Furuneo wiped- sweat from his 
forehead. 

“Have you tried calling Abnethe 
long distance?” 

“Don’t be stupid,” McKie said. 
“That’s the first thing I tried.” 

“Well?” 

“Either the Taprisiots are tell- 
WHIPPINGSTAR 



ing the truth and can’t make con- 
tact or she’s bought them off some 
way. What difference does it make? 
So I contact her. How does that 
tell me where she is? How do I in- 
voke a monitor clause with some- 
one who doesn’t wear a monitor?” 
“How could she buy off the 
Taprisiots?” 

“How do I know? For that mat- 
ter, how could she hire a Caleban?” 
Invocation of value exchange. 
•the Caleban said. 

McKie chewed at his upper lip. 

F uruneo leaned against the 
wall behind him. He knew what 
inhibited McKie here. You walked 
softly with a strange sentient spe- 
cies. No telling what might cause 
affront. Even the way you phrased 
a question could cause trouble. 
BuSab should have assigned a 
Zeno expert to help McKie. 

“Abnethe offered you some- 
thing of value, Fanny Mae?” Mc- 
Kie ventured. 

I offer judgment, the Caleban 
said. Abnethe may not be judged 
friendly-good-nice-kindly — accept- 
able. 

“Is that your judgment?” Mc- 
Kie asked. 

Your species prohibits flagella- 
tion of sentients, the Caleban said. 
Abnethe orders me flagellated. 
“Why don’t you just refuse?” 
Contract obligation. 

“Contract obligation?” 

McKie glanced at Furuneo, who 
shrugged. 

“Ask where she goes to be flagel- 
lated,” Furuneo suggested. 
Flagellation comes to me. 

“By flagellation, you mean 

21 




you’re whipped? Is that right?” 

Explanation of whipping des- 
cribes production of froth, the 
Caleban said. Not proper term. 
Abnethe orders me flogged. 

“That thing talks like a compu- 
ter,” Furuneo said. 

“Let me handle this,” McKie 
ordered. • 

Computer describes mechanical 
device, the Caleban said. I live. 

“He meant no insult,” McKie 
said. 

Insult not interpreted. 

“Does the flogging hurt you?” 
McKie asked. 

Explain hurt. 

“Cause you discomfort?” 

Reference recalled. Such sensa- 
tions explained. Explanations cross 
no connectives. 

“Do you choose to be flogg^?” 
he asked. 

Choice made. 

“Well, would you make the 
same choice if you had it to do 
over?” 

Confusing reference, the Cale- 
ban said. Ij over refers to repeti- 
tion, I make no voice in repetition. 
Abnethe sends Palenki with whip 
and flogging occurs. 

Furuneo shuddered. 

“A Palenki!” 

“You knew it had to be some- 
thing like that,” McKie said. 
“What else could you get to do 
such a thing except a creature with- 
out much brain and lots of obe- 
dient muscle?” 

“But a Palenki! Couldn’t we 
hunt for — ” 

“We’ve known, from the first 
what she had to be using,” McKie 
said. “Where do you hunt for one 



Palenki?” He shrugged. “Why 
can’t Calebans understand the 
concept of being hurt? Is it pure 
semantics or do they lack the 
proper nerve linkages?” 

Understand nerves, the Caleban 
.,-said. Any sentience must possess 
control linkages. But hurt — dis- 
continuity of meaning appears 
insurmountable. 

“Abnethe can’t stand the sight 
of pain you said,” Furuneo re- 
minded McKie. 

“Yeah. How does she watch the 
floggings?” 

Abnethe views my home. 

When no further answer was 
forthcoming McKie asked, “I 
don’t understand. What’s your 
home have to do with it?” 

My home this. My home con- 
tains — aligns? Master S'eye. Ab- 
nethe possesses connectives for 
which she pays. 

McKie wondered if ihe Caleban 
were playing some sarcastic game 
with him. But all the information 
about the species made no refer- 
ence to sarcasm. Word confusions, 
yes — but -no apparent insults or 
subterfuges. 

“Abnefhe sounds like a mixed- 
up bitch,” McKie muttered. 

Physically unmixed, the Cale- 
ban said. Isolated in her own con- 
nectives now but unified and pre- 
sentable by your standards — so 
say judgments made in my pres- 
ence. If, however, you refer to 
Abnethe psyche, mixed-up con- 
veys accurate description. What I 
see of Abnethe psyche most inter- 
twined. Convolutions of odd color 
displace my vision-sense in extra- 
ordinary fashion.

McKie gulped. 

“You sec her psyche?” 

I see all psyche, 

“So much for the theory that 
Calebans cannot see,” Furuneo 
said. ”A1I is illu^on, eh?” 

“How is this possible?” McKie 
asked. 

/ occupy space between physical 
and mental, the Caleban said. 
Thus your Jellow sentients explain 
in your terminology, 

“Gibberish,” McKie said. 

You achieve discontinuity of 
meaning, 

“Why did you accept Abnethe’s 
offer of employment?” 

No common rejerrent for ex- 
planation, 

“You achieve discontinuity of 
meaning,” Furuneo said. 

So I surmise, 

“I must fjnd Abnethc,” McKie 
said. 

I give warning, the Caleban 
said. 

“Watch it,” Furuneo whispered. 
“1 sense rage that's not connected 
with the angeret,'" 

McKie waved him to silence. 

“What warning, Fanny Mae?” 

Potentials in your situation, the 
Caleban said. / allow my— person? 
Yes, my person, I allow my person 
to entrap itself in association 
which fellow sentients may inter- 
pret as nonfriendly, 

M CKIE scratched his head, 
wondered how close they 
were to anything that could yalidly 
be called communication. He 
wanted to come right out and in- 
quire about the Caleban disap- 
pearances, the deaths and insanity. 



but feared possible consequences. 

“Nonfriendly?” 

Understand, the Caleban said, 
life which flow^ in all carries sub- 
ternal connectives. Each entity re- 
mains linked until final discon- 
tinuity removes from — network? 
Yes, suitable term: network. Un- 
aware of tanglements, I convey 
linkages of other entities into as- 
sociation with Abnethe, Should 
personal discontinuity overtake 
self— all entities entangled share 
it, 

“Discontinuity?” McKie asked, 
not sure he followed this but afraid 
he did. 

Tanglements come from con- 
tact between sentients not origin- 
ating in same linearities of aware- 
ness, the Caleban said, ignoring 
McIGe’s question. 

“I’m not sure what you mean by 
discontinuity,” Me Kie pressed. 

In context ultimate discontinu- 
ity presumed opposite of pleasure 
— your term, 

“You’re getting nowhere,” Fu- 
runeo said. 

His head ached from trying to 
equate the radiant impulses of 
communication from the Caleban 
with speech. 

“Sounds like a semantic identity 
situation,” McKie said. “Black 
and white statements — but we’re 
trying to find an interpretation in 
between.” 

All between, the Caleban said. 

“Presumed opposite of pleas- 
ure?” 

“Our term,” Furuneo reminded 
him. 

“Tell me, Fanny Mae,” McKie 
said, “do we other sentients refer

to this ultimate discontinuity as 
death?” 

Presumed (^proximate term, 
the Caleban said. Abnegation oj 
mutual awareness, ultimate dis- 
continuity, death — all appear sim- 
ilar descriptives. 

“If you die many others are go- 
ing to die — is that it?” 

All users oJ S’ eye. All in tangle- 
ment. 

M;cKie was shocked. 

“All?” - 

All such in your — wave? Diffi- 
cult concept. Calebans possess 
label for this concept— plane? 
Planguinity of beings? Surmise 
proper term not shared. Problem 
concealed in visual exclusion which 
clouds mutual association. 

Furuneo touched McKie’s arm. 

'“Is she saying that if she dies 
everyone who’s used a S’eye jump- 
door goes with her?” 

'“Sounds like it.” 

“I don’t believe it!” 

“The evidence would seem to in- 
dicate we have to believe her.” 

“But—” 

“I wonder if she’s in any danger 
of going soon.” 

“If you grant the premise, that’s 
a good question.” 

“VSTiat precedes your ultimate 
discontinuity, Fanny Mae?” Mc- 
Kie asked. 

All precedes ultimate disconti- 
nuity. 

“Yeah, but are you headed to- 
ward this ultimate discontinu- 
ity?” 

Without choice, all head for ul- 
timate discontinuity. 

“McKie mopped his forehead. 
-The temperature inside the Bail

had been going up rather steadily. 

I fulfill demands of honor, the 
Caleban said. Acquaint you with 
prospect. Sentients of your— plan- 
guinity appear unable, lacking 
means of withdrawal from influ- 
ence of my association with Ab- 
nethe. Communication under- 
stood? 

“McKie,” Furuneo said, “have 
you any idea how many sentients 
have used a jumpdoor?” 

“Damn near everyone.” 

Communication understood?-thc 
Caleban repeated. 

“I don’t know,” McKie groaned. 

Difficult sharing of concepts, 
the Caleban said. 

“I still don’t believe it,” Furuneo 
said. 

“You’d better believe it,” Mc- 
Kie said. “It squares with what° 
some of the other Calebans said, 
near as we can reconstruct it after 
the messes they’ve left.” 

Understand withdrawal of com- 
panions creates disruption, the 
Caleban said. Disruption equates 
with mess? 

“That’s about it,” McKie said. 
“Tell me, Fanny Mae, is there im- 
mediate danger of your — ultimate 
discontinuity?” 

Explain imminent. 

“Soon,” McKie snapped. 
“Short time.” 

Time concept difficult, the Cale- 
ban said. You inquire of personal 
ability to surmount flagellation? 

“That’s good enough,” McKie 
said. “How many more flagella- 
tions can you survive?” 

Explain survive. 

“How many flagellations until 
you experience ultimate disconti- 



IF 




nuity? Can you possibly know?” 

Perhaps ten flagellations. Per- 
haps lesser number. Perhaps more, 

“And your death will kill all of 
us?” McKie asked, hoping he had 
misunderstood. 

Lesser number than all, the 
Caleban said. 

“You just think you’re under- 
standing her,’’ Furuneo said. 

“I’m afraid I understand her.” 

Fellow Calebans, the Caleban 
said, recognizing entrapment, 
achieve withdrawing. Thus they 
avoid discontinuity, 

“How many Calebans remain in 
our — plane?’’ 

Single entity of selfness, the 
Caleban said. 

“Just the "one,’’ McKie mut- 
tered. “That’s a damn thin 
thread.” 

“I don’t see how the death of one 
Caleban can cause all that havoc,’’ 
Furuneo said. 

Explain by comparison. Scien- 
tist of your planguinity explains 
reaction of stellar selfdom. Stellar 
mass enters expanding condition. 
In this condition stellar mass en- 
gulfs and reduces all substances to 
other energy patterns. All sub- 
stances encountered by stellar ex- 
pansion change. Thus ultimate dis- 
continuity of personal selfdom 
reaches hlong linkages of S*eye 
connectives, repatterns all entities 
encountered, 

“Stellar selfdom,” Furuneo 
said, shaking his head. 

Incorrect term? the Caleban 
asked. Energy selfdom, perhaps', 

S HE’S saying,” McKie said, 
“that use of S’eye doors has 



tangled us with her life some way. 
Her death will reach out like a 
stellar explosion along all these 
tangled networks and kill us.’’ 

“That’s what you think she’s 
saying,” Furuneo objected. 

“That’s what I have to believe 
she’s saying,’’ McKie said. “Our 
communication may be tenuous 
but I think she’s sincere. Can’t you 
still feel the emotions radiating 
from her?” 

“Two sp^ies can be said to 
share emotions only in the broad- 
est way,” Furuneo said. “She 
doesn’t even understand what we 
mean by pain.’’ 

Scientist of your planguinity, 
the Caleban said, explains emo- 
tional base for communication. 
Lacking emotional commonality, 
sameness of labels uncertain. Emo- 
tion concept not certain for Cale- 
bans, Communication difficulty 
assumed, 

McKie nodded. He could see a 
further complication — the ques- 
tion of whether the Caleban’ s 
words were spoken or radiated in 
some unthinkable manner com- 
pleted their confusion. 

“I believe you’re right in one 
thing,” Furuneo said. 

“Yes?” 

“We have to assume we under- 
stand her.” 

McKie swallowed in a dry 
throat. 

“Fanny Mae,’’ he said, “have 
you explained this ultimate discon- 
tinuity prospect to Mliss Ab- 
nethe?” 

Problem explained, the Caleban 
said. Fellow Calebans attempt 
remedy of error, Abnethe fails of

comprehension or disregards con- 
sequences, Connectives difficult, 

‘"Connectives difficult,” McKie 
muttered. 

All connectives of single S*eye, 
the Caleban said. Master S*eye of 
self creates mutual problem, 

“Don’t tell me you understand 
that,” Furuneo objected. 

“ Abnethe employs Master S’eye 
of self,” the Caleban said. “Con- 
tract agreement gives Abnethe 
right of use. One Master S’eye of 
self. Abnethe uses.” 

“So she opens a junipdoor and 
sends her Palenki through it,” 
Furuneo said. “Why don’t we just 
wait here and grab her?” 

“She could close the door before 
we even got near her,” McKie 
growled. “No, there’s more to 
what this Caleban’s saying. I think 
she’s telling us there’s only one 
Master S’eye — control system, 
perhaps, for all the jumpdoors — 
and Fanny Mae here is in control 
of it or the channel operation 
or—” 

“Or something.” 

Abnethe control S* eye by right 
of purchase, the Caleban said. 

“See what 1 ipean?” McKie said. 
“Can you override her control, 
Fanny Mae?” 

Terms of employment require 
not interfere, 

“But can’t you still use your own 
S’eye doors?” McKie pressed. 

All use, the Caleban said. 

“This is insane!” Furuneo 
snapped. 

Insanity defines as lack of order- 
ly thought progression in mutual 
acceptance of logical terms, the 
Caleban said. Insanity frequent 



judgment of one species upon other 
species. Proper interpretation 
otherwise, 

“I think I just had my wrist 
slapped,” Furuneo said. 

“Look,” McKie said, “the other 
deaths and insanity around Cale- 
ban disappearances substantiate 
our interpretation. We’re dealing 
with something explosive and dan- 
gerous.” 

“So we find Abnethe and stop 
her.” 

“You make that sound so sim- 
ple,” McKie said. “Here are your 
orders. Get out of here and alert 
the Bureau. The Caleban’s com- 
munication won’t show on your 
recorder but you’ll have it all down 
in your memory. Tell them to scan 
you for it.” 

“Right. You’re staying?” 

“Yes.” 

“What’ll I say you’re doing?” 

“1 want to look at Abnethe’s 
companions and her surround- 
ings.” 

Furuneo cleared his throat. 

“Have you thought of, you 
know— just bang?” 

He made the motion of firing a 
raygen. 

“There’s a limit on what can go 
through a jumpdoor and how fast,” 
McKie chided. “You know that.” 

“Maybe this jumpdoor’s differ- 
ent.” 

“I doubt it.” 

“After I’ve reported in, what 
then?” 

“Sit tight outside there until I 
call you — unless they give you a 
message for me. Oh, and start a 
general search on Cordiality — just 
in case,” 



26 



IF 




“Of course.” Furuneo hesitated. 
“One thing— whom do I contact at 
the Bureau? Bildoon?” 

McKie glanced up. Why should 
Furuneo question whom to call? 
What was he trying to say? 

It dawned on McKie then that 
Furuneo had hit on a logical con- 
cern. BuSab director Napoleon 
Bildoon was a Pan Spechi, ^ntar- 
chal sentient, human only in ap- 
pearance. Since McKie, a human, 
held nominal charge in this case, 
that might appear to confine con- 
trol of it, excluding other members 
of the ConSentiency. Inter-species 
political infighting could take odd 
turns in a time of stress. Best to in- 
volve a broad directorate here. 

“Thanks,” McKie said. I wasn’t 
thinking much beyond the imme- 
diate problem.” 

“This is the immediate prob- 
lem.” 

“I understand. All right, I was 
tapped for this chore by our Direc- 
tor of Discretion.” 

“Gitchel Siker?” 

“Yes.” 

- “That’s one Laclac and Bildoon, 
a PanSpechi. Who else?” 

“Get somebody out of the legal 
department.” 

“Bound to be a human.”. 

“The minute you stretch it that 
far — they’ll all get the message,” 
McKie said. “They’ll bring in the 
others before making any crucial 
decision.” 

Furuneo nodded. 

“One other thing.” 

“What?” 

“How do I get out of here?” 
“Good question.” McKie faced 
the giant spoon. “Fanny Mae, how 



does my companion leave here?” 
“He wishes to journey where?” 
“To his home.” 

Connectives apparent,, the Cale- 
ban said. 

M CKIf felt a gush of air. His 
ears popped to a change in 
pressure. There was a sound like 
the pulling of a cork from a bot- 
tle. He whirled. Furuneo was 
gone. 

“You — sent him home?” McKie 
asked. 

Correct. Desired destination vis- 
ible. Sent swiftness. Prevent tem- 
perature drop below proper level. 

McKie, feeling perspiration roll 
down his cheeks, said, “I wish I 
knew how you did that? Can you 
actually see our thoughts?” 

See only strong connectives. 

The Caleban’s remark about 
temperature came back to him. 
What was a proper temperature 
' level? Damn! The air was boiling 
in here. His skin itched with per- 
spiration. His throat was, dry. Pro- 
per temperature level? 

“What’s the opposite of pro- 
per?” 

False. 

McKie gave up. How could false 
be the opposite of proper? He 
passed a hand across his forehead, 
gathering perspiration which he 
tried to wipe off on his jacket. 

The shiminering oval above the 
giant spoon abruptly wavered out- 
ward, contracted, flowed up, down, 
left. McKie received a definite im-

27 




pression of distress. The oval -van- 
ished but his eyes still tracked the 
Caleban’s unpresence. 

“Is something wrong?” M cKie 
masked. 

The round vortal tube of a S’eye 
jumpdoor opened behind the 
Caleban. Beyond the opening 
stood a woman, a figure dwarfed 
as though seen through the wrong 
end of a telescope. McKie recog- 
nized her from all the newsvisos 
and from the holoscans he’d been 
fed as background briefing for this 
assignment. 

He was confronting Mliss Ab- 
nethe in a light somewhat reddened 
by its slow^ passage through the 
jumpdoor. 

It was ob\4ous that the beauty- 
barbers of Steadyon had been 
about their expensive work on her 
person. He made a mental note to 
have that checked. Her figure pre- 
sented the youthful curves of a 
pleasurefem. The face beneath 
fairyblue hair was focused around 
a r^ petal mouth. Large summery 
green eyes and a sharply cleaving 
nose conveyed odd contrast — dig- 
nity versus hoyden. She was a 
flawed queen — age mingled with 
youth. She must be at least eighty 
standard years but the beautybar- 
bers had achieved this startling 
combination — available pleasure- 
fem and remote, hungry power. 

' The expensive body wore a long 
gown of gray rainpearls which 
matched her, movement for move- 
ment, like a glittering skin. She 
moveid nearer the vortal 'tube. As 
she approached, the edges of the 
tube blocked off first her feet, then 
her legs, thighs, waist. 



McKie felt his knees age a thou- 
sand years in that brief passage. 
He remained crouched near the 
place where he had entered the 
Beachball. 

“Ah, Fanny Mae,” Mliss Ab- 
nethe said. “You have a guest.” 

Jumpdoor interference caused 
her voice to sound faintly hoarse. 

“I am Jorj X. McKie, Saboteur 
Extraordinary.” 

Was that a contraction in the 
pupils of her eyes? McKie won- 
dered. She stopped with only her 
head and shoulders visible in the 
tube’s circle. 

“And I am Mliss Abenthe, pri- 
vatecitizen.” 

Private citizen? McKie thought 
that this bitch controlled the pro- 
ductive capacity of at least five 
hundred worlds. He rose slowly, to 
his feet. 

“The Bureau of Sabotage has 
official business with you,” he said, 
putting her on notice to satisfy the 
legalities. 

“I am a private citizen.” 

The words were prideful, vain, 
marred by petulance. 

McKie took heart at the re- 
vealed weakness. It was a particu- 
lar kind of flaw that often went 
with wealth and power. 

“Fanny Mae, am I your guest?” ‘ 
he asked. 

Indeed, the Caleban said. / 
open my door to you. 

“Am I your employer, Fanny 
Mae?” Abnethe demanded. 

Indeed, you employ me. 

A breathless, crouching look 
came over her face. Her eyes went 
to slits. 

“Very well. Then prepare to ful- 

IF 



28 




fill at once the obligations of — ” 
“One moment.” 

McKie felt desperate. Why was 
she moving so fast? What was that 
faint whine in her voice? 

“Guests do not interfere.” 
“BuSab makes its own decisions 
about interference.” 

“Your jurisdiction has limits.” 
McKie heard the beginnings of 
many actions in that statement — 
hired operatives, gigantic sums 
spent as bribes, doctored agree- 
ments, treaties, stories planted 
with the visos on how this good and 
proud lady had been mistreated by 
her government, a wide enlistment 
of personal concern to justify — 
what? Violence against his person? 
He thought not. More likely to dis- 
credit him, to saddle him with on- 
erous misdeeds. 

Thought of all that power made 
McKie wonder suddenly why he 
made himself vulnerable to it. Why 
had he chosen BuSab? Because I’m 
difficult to please, he told himself. 
I’m a Saboteur by choice. There 
was no going back on that choice 
now. BuSab appeared to walk 
down the middle of everywhere 
and always wound up on the high 
road. 

“Agreed we have limits,” McKie 
growled, “but I doubt you’ll ever 
see them. Now, what’s going on 
here?” 

“You’re not a police agent.” 
“Perhaps I should summon po- 
lice.” 

“On what grounds?” 

She smiled. She had him there 
and knew it. Her legal staff had 
explained to he^ the open-associa- 
tion clause in the ConSentient Ar- 



ticles of Federation: When mem- 
bers of different species agree for- 
mally to an association from ' which 
they derive mutual benefits the 
contracting parties shall be the sole 
judges of said benefits, provided 
their agreement breaks no law, 
covenant or legative article binding 
upon said contracting parties; pro- 
vided further that stud formal 
agreement was achieved by volun-/ 
tary means and involves no breach 
of the public peace. 

“Your actions will bring about 
the death of this Caleban,” McKie 
said. 

He did not hold out much hope 
for this argument but it bought a 
bit more time. ^ ^ 

“You’ll have to establish that 
the Caleban^ concept of discontin- 
uity interprets precisely as 
death,” Abnethe said. “You can’t 
do that because it’s not true. Wiy 
do you interfere? This is just" 
harmless play between consenting 
ad—” 

More than play, the Caleban 
said. 

“Fanny Mae,” Abnethe or- 
dered. “You are not to interrupt! 
Remember our agreement.” 

M CKIE stared in the direction 
of the Caleban’s unpresence, 
tried to interpret the spectrum 
flare that rejected his senses. 

Discern conflict between ideals 
and structure of government, the 
Caleban said. 

“Precisely,” Abnethe said. “I’m 
assured that Calebans cannot suf- 
fer pain, that they don’t even have 
a term for it. If it’s my pleasure to 
stage an apparent flogging and ob-

“Are you sure she suffers no 
pain?” McKie'a^ed. 

Again a gloating smile came 
over Abnethe’s face. 

*Tve never seen her suffer pain. 
Have you?” 

“Have you seen her do any- 
thing?” 

“I’ve seen her come and go.” 
“Do you suffer pain, Fanny 
Mae?” McKie asked. 

No referrents Jor this concept, 
“Are these floggings going to 
bring about your ultimate discon- 
tinuity?” McKie asked. 

Explain bring tAoiut. 

“Is there any connection be- 
tween the floggings and your ulti- 
mate discontinuity?” * 

Total universe connectives in- 
clude all events. ■ 

“I pay well for my ^me,” Ab- 
nethe said. “Stop interfering, 
McKie.” 

“How are you paying?” 

“None of your business.” 

“I make it my business,” McKie 
said. “Fanny Mae?” 

“Don’t answer him,” Abnethe 
snapped. 

“I can still summon police and 
the officers of a Discretionary 
Court,” McKie said. 

“By all meads,” Abnethe 
gloated. “You are, of course, ready 
to answer a suit charging interfer-. 
ence with in open agreeitoent be- 
tween consenting members of dif- 
ferent species?” 

“I can still get an injunction,” 
McKie said, “^at’s your present 
address?” 

“I decline to answer on advice of 
counsel.”

McKie glared at her. She had 
him. He could not charge her with 
flight to prevent prosecution un- 
less he had provra a crime. To 
prove a crime he must get a court 
to act and serve her with the proper 
papers in the presence of bonded 
witnesses, bring her into a court 
and allow her to face her accusers. 
And her attorneys would tie him 
in knots every step of the way. 

0/fef judgment, the Caleban 
said. Nothing in Abnethe contract 
prohibits revelation oj payment. 
Employer provides educators. 
“Educators?” ’ 

“Very well,” Abnethe conceded. 
“I provide Fanny Mae with Jhe 
finest instructors and teaching aids 
our civilization can supply. She’s 
been soaking up our culture. Any- 
thing she requested she got. And 
it wasn’t cheap.” 

“And she still doe^’t under- 
stand pain?” 

Hope to acquire proper refer- 
ents. 

“Will you have time to acquire 
those referents?” 

Time difficult concept, the Cale- 
ban said. Statement of instructor, 
to wit: ‘Relevancy of time to learn- 
ing varies with species.’ Time pos- 
sesses length, unknown quality 
termed duration, subjective and 
objective dimension. Confusing. 

“Let’s make this official,” 
McKie said. “Abnethe, are you 
aware that you’re killing this Cale- 
ban?” 

“Discontinuity and death are 
not the same,” Abnethe objected. 
“Are they, Fanny Mae?” 

Wide disparity of equivalents ex- 
ist between separate waves of being. 



IF 




“I ask you formally, Mliss Ab- 
nethe,” McKic said, "‘if this Calc- 
ban calling herself Fanny Mae 
has told you the consequences of 
an event she describes as ultimate 
discontinuity?” 

“You just heard her say there 
are no equivalents.” 

“You’ve not answered my ques- 
tion.” 

“You’re quibbling.” 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie said, 
“have you described for Mliss Ab- 
nethe, the consequents of — ” 
Bound by contract connectives, 
the Caleban said. 

“You see.” Abnethe pounced. 
“She’s bound by our open agree- 
ment and you’re interfering.” 
Abnethe gestured to someone 
not visible in the jumpdoor’s vor- 
tal tube. 

T he opening suddenly doubled 
its diameter. Abnethe stepped 
aside, leaving half her head and 
one eye visible to McKie. A crowd 
of watching sentients could be dis- 
cerned now in the background. 
Into Abnethe’ s place darted the 
turtle form of a giant Palenki. Its 
hundreds of tiny feet flickered be- 
neath its bulk. The single arm 
growing from the top if its ring- 
eyed head trailed a long whip in 
a double-thumbed hand. The arm 
thrust through the tube, jerked 
the whip against jumpdoor resis- 
tance, lashed the whip forward. 
The whip cracked above the spoon 
bowl. 

A crystalline spray of green 
shower^ the unseeable region of 
the Caleban. It glittered for a 
moment like a fluorescent explo- 



sion of fireworks, then dissolved. 

An ecstatic moan came through 
the vortal tube. 

McKie fought an intense out- 
pouring sensation .of distress, 
leap^ forward. Instantly, the S’- 
eye jumpdoor closed, dumping a 
severed Palenki arm and whip on- 
to the floor of the room. The arm 
writhed and turned, slowed — 
slowed. It fell still. 

“Fanny Mae?” McKie said. 

Yes? 

“Did that whip hit you?” 

Explain whip hit, 

“Encounter your substance!” 
Approximately, 

McKie moved close to the 
spoon bowl. He still sensed dis- 
tress but knew it could be a side 
effect of angeret and the incident 
he’d just witnessed. 

“Describe the flogging sensa- 
tion,” he said. 

You possess no proper refer- 
ents, 

“Try me.” 

I inhaled substance of whip, ex- 
haled my own substance, 

“You breathed it?” 
Aproximately. > 

“Well — describe your physical 
reactions.” 

No common physical referents, 
“Any reaction, dammit!”

and wind action — McKie thought 
he conveyed an approximate idea 
of green spray. 

You observe this phenomenon? 

“I saw it, yes.” 

Extraordinary! 

McKie hesitated, an odd 
thought fflling his mind. Could he 
be as insubstantial to the Caleban 
as the Cxrleban appeared to him? 

He asked. 

All vreatures possess substance 
relative to their own quantum ex- 
istence, the Caleban said. 

“But do you se« our substance 
when you look at us?” 

Basic difficulty. Your species re- 
peats this question. Possess no cer- 
tain answer, 

“Try to explain. Start by telling 
me about the green spray.” 

Greenspray unknown phenom- 
enon, 

“But what could it be?” 

Perhaps interplanar phenom- 
enon, reaction to exhalation of my 
substance, 

“Is there a limit to how much of 
your substance you can exhale?” 

Quantum relationship defies 
limitations of your plane. Move- 
ment exists between planar ori- 
gins, Movement changes referen- 
tial relatives. 

No constant referents? McKie 
wondered. But there had to be. 
He explored this aspect with the 
Caleban,. questions and answers 
obviously making less and less 
sense to both of them. 

“But there must be some con- 
stant.” 

Connectives possess aspect of 
this constant you seek , " 

“What are connectives?” 



No — 

“Referents!” McKie stormed. 
“Then why use the term?” 

Term approximates. Tangential 
occlusion another term expressing 
something similar, 

“Tangential occlusion,” McKie 
muttered. Then: “Tangential oc- 
clusion?” 

Fellow Caleban offers this term 
after discussion of problem with 
Laclac sentient possessing rare in- 
sight, 

“One of you talked this over 
with a Laclac, eh? Who wa's this 
Laclac?” 

Identity not conveyed but occu- 
pation known and understandable, 
'^‘Oh? What was his occupa- 
tion?” 

Dentist, 

McKie exhaled a long, held 
breath, shook his head with be- 
wilderment. 

“You understand — dentist?” 

All species requipng ingestion 
of energy sources must reduce 
such sources to convenient form, 
“You mean they bite?” 

Explain bite, 

“I thought you understood den- 
tist.” 

Dentist — one who maintains 
system by which sentients shape 
energy for ingestion, 

“Tangential occlusion,” McKie 
muttered. “Explain what you un- 
derstand by occlusion,” 

Proper matching of related 
parts in shaping system, 

“We’re getting nowhere,” Mc- 
Kie growled. 

Every creature somewhere, the 
Caleban said. 

“But where? Where are you,

for example? Just tell me that.” 

Planar relationships unexplain- 
able. 

“Let’s try something else,” Mc- 
Kie said. “I’ve heard you can 
read our writing.” 

Reducing what you term writ- 
ing to compatible connectives sug- 
gests time-constant communica- 
tion, the Caleban said. Not really 
certain, however, of time-constant 
or required connectives. 

“Well — let’s go at the verb ‘to 
see,’ ” McKie said. “Tell me what 
you understand by the action of 
seeing.” 

To see — receive sensory aware- 
ness of external energy. 

McKie buried his face in his 
hands. He felt dispirited, brain 
numbed by the Caleban’s . radi- 
ant bombardment. What would be 
the sensory organs? He knew such 
a question would only send them 
off on another empty label chase. 

Presently he dropped his hands, 
said, “Is there somewhere yOu 



could take this — your home — 
where Mliss Abnethe couldn’t 
reach you.” 

Cannot. 

“Why?” 

Agreement prohibits. 

“Break the damned agree- 
ment!” 

Dishonorable action brings ulti- 
mate discontinuity for all sentients 
on your — suggest wave as better 
term. Wave. Much closer ■ term 
than plane. Please substitute con- 
cept of wave wherever plane used 
in our discussion. 

This thing was impossible, Mc- 
Kie thought. 

He lifted his arms in a gesture 
of frustration and, in the move- 
ment, felt his bodj? jerk as a long- 
distance call ignited his pineal 
gland. The message began to roll 
and he knew his body had gone 
into the sniggertrance, mumbling 
and chuckling, trembling occasion- 
ally.

Ill 

ITCHEL SIKER here,” the 
V3T caller said. 

McKie imagined the Bureau’s 
Director of Discretion^ a suave 
little Laclac sitting in that nicely 
tailored environment back at 
Central. Siker would be relaxed, 
fighting tendril withdrawn, his 
face slit open, an elite chairdog 
ministering to his flesh, trained 
minions a buttonpush away. 

“About 'time you called,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

“About time I called?” 



“Well, you certainly must’ve 
gotten Fuhineo’s message quite 
a — ” 

“What message?” 

McKie felt as though his mind 
had touched a grinding wheel, 
shooting off ideas like sparks. No 
message from Furuneo? 

“Furuneo,” McKie said, “left 
here long enough ago to — ” 

“I’m calling,” Siker inter- 
rupted, “because there’s been no 
sign of either of you for too damn 
long and Furuneo’s enforcers are 
worried. Where was Furuneo sup- 
posed to go and how?” 



3 ^ 




McKie felt an idea blossoming 
in his mind. 

“Where was Furuneo born?” 
“Born? On Landy-B. Why?” 

“I think we’ll And him there. 
The Caleban used its S’eye sys- 
tem to send him home. If he 
hasn’t called yet, better send for 
him. He was supposed to — ” 
“Landy-B only has three Tapris- 
iots and one jumpdoor. It’s a re- 
treat ' planet, full of recluses 
and — ” 

“That would explain the delay. 
Meanwhile, here’s the sitva- 
tion— ” 

McKie began detailing the 
problem. 

“Do you believe this, this ulti- 
mate discontinuity thing?” Siker 
interrupted. 

“We have to believe it. The evi- 
dence all says it’s true.” 

“Well, maybe— -but — 

“Can we afford a maybe, 
Siker?” 

“We’d better call in the po- 
lice.” 

“I think she wants us to do just 
that.” 

“Wants us? Why?” 

“Who would have to sign a 
complaint?” 

Silence. 

“Are you getting the picture?” 
McKie press^. 

“It’s on your head, "McKie.’’ 

“It always is. But if we’re right 
— that doesn’t make any differ- 
ence, does it?” 

“I’m going to suggest,” Siker 
said, “that we contact the top 
level in the Central Police Bureau 
— for consultation only. Agreed?” 
“Discuss that with Bildoon.

Meanwhile, here’s what I want 
done. Assemble a Bureau Con- 
Sentient Council, draft another 
max-alert message. Keep the 
emphasis on Calel»ns but brin^ in 
the Palenkis and start looking into 
Abnethe’s — ” 

“We can’t do that and you 
know it.’’ 

• “We have to do it.’’ 

“When you took this assign- 
ment, you received a full explana- 
tion of why we — ’’ 

“Utmost discretion doesn’t 
mean hands off,’’ McKie said. “If 
that’s the way you’re thinking 
then you’ve missed the impor- 
tance of — ’’ 

“McKie, I can’t believe — ’’ 

“Sign off, Siker,’’ McKie said. 
“I’m going over your head to Bil- 
doon.’’ 

Silence. 

“Break this contact,’’ McKie or- 
dered. 

“That won’t be necessary.’’ 
“Won’t it?’’ 

“I’ll put the agents onto Ab- 
nethe at once. I see your point. If 
we assume that — ’’ 

“We assume,” McKie said. 

“The orders will be issu^ in 
your name, of course,” Siker said. 

“Keep your skirts clean anyway 
you like,” McKie said. “Now, 
have our people start probing into 
the Beautybarbers of Steady on. 
She’s been there and recently. Al- 
so, I’ll be sending along a whip 
she—” 

“A whip?” 

“I just witnessed one of the 
flagellations. Abnethe cut the con- 
nection while her Palenki still had 
an arm through the S’eye door. 



Cut the arm right off. The Pal- 
enki will grow another arm and 
she can hire more Palenkis — but 
the whip and arm could ^ve us a 
lead. Palenkis don’t practice geiie 
tagging, I know, but it’s the best 
we have at the moment.” 

“I understand. What did you 
see during the — incident?” 

“I‘m getting to that.” 

“Hadn’t you better come in and 
put y<wr report directly onto a 
transcorder?” 

“I’ll depend on you for that. 
Don’t think I should show at Cen- 
tral for a bit.” 

“Right. See what you mean. 
She’ll try to tie you up with a 
countersuit.” 

R I miss my guess. Now, 
here’s what I saw. When 
she opened the door she practi- 
cally filM it — but I could see 
what appeared to be a window in 
the background. It it was a win- 
dow, it opened onto a cloudy sky. 
That means daylight.” 

“Cloudy?” 

“Yes. Why?” 

“It’s been cloudy here all morn- 
ing. 

“You don’t think she’s — no, she 
wouldn’t.” 

“Probably not — but we’ll have 
Central scoured just to be sure. 
With her money, no telling whom . 
she has bought.” 

“Yeah — ^well, the Palenki. Its 
shell carried an odd design — tri- 
angles, diamonds in red and or- 
ange and a rope or snake of yellow 
wound all the way around and 
through it.” 

“Phylum identification.” 




36 



IF 




“Yes — but what Palenki Fam- 
ily?” 

“Well, we’ll check it. What 
else?” 

“There was a mob of sentients 
behind her during the actual flog- 
ging. I saw Preylings— couldn’t 
miss those wire tentacles. There 
were some Chithers, a few Sobo- 
rips, some Wreaves — ” 

“Sounds like her usual patch of 
sycophants. Recognize any?” 

“I’ll try to ID’s later but I 
couldn’t attach any names to this 
mob. But there was one, a Pan 
Spechi and he was stagfrozen or I 
miss my guess.” 

“You sure?” 

A ll I know IS what I saw and I 
saw the scars on his forehead — 
ego surgery, sure as I’m snigger- 
mg. 

“That’s against every Pan 
Spechi legal, moral and ethical — ” 
“The scars were purple,” Mc- 
Kie saidl “That checks, doesn’t 
it?” 

“Right out in the open, no 
makeup or anything to cover the 
scars?” 

“Nothing. If I’m right it means 
he’s the only Pan Spechi with her. 
Another would kill him op sight.” 
“Where could she be where 
there’d be only one Pan Spechi?” 
“Beats me. Oh, and there were 
some humans, too — green uni- 
forms.” 

“Abnethe houseguards.” 

“That’s the way I made it.” 
“Quite a mob to be hiding 
away.” 

“If anyone can afford it, she 
can.” 



“One more thing,” McKie said. 
“I smelled yeast.” 

“Yeast?” 

“No doubt about it. There’s 
always a pressure differential 
through a jumpdoor. It was blow- 
ing our way. Yeast.” 

“That’s quite a bag of observa- 
tions.” 

“Did you think I was getting 
careless?” , 

“No more than usual, Are you 
absolutely sure about that Pan 
Spechi?” 

“1 saw the eyes.” 

“Sunken, the facets smoothing 
over?” 

“That’s the way it looked to 
me* 

“If we can get a Pan Spechi to 
make an official observation of this 
fellow it would give us a lever. 
Harboring a criminal, you know.” 
“Apparently you haven’t much 
experience .with Pan Spechi,” Mc- 
Kie said. “How did you get to be 
Director of Discretion?” 

“All right, McKie, let’s not — ” 
“You know damn’ well a Pan 
Spechi would blow up if he saw 
this fellow. Our observer would 
try to dive through the jumpdoor 
and—” 

“So?” 

. “Abnethe would close it on 
him. She’d have half of our ob- 
server and we’d have the other 
half.” 

“But that would be murder.” 
“An unfortunate accident, no 
more.” 

“That woman does swing a lot 
of weight, I admit, but — ” 

“And she’ll have our hides if 
she can make it stick that she’s a

private citizen and we’re trying to 
sabotage her.” 

“Messy,” Siker agreed. “I hope 
you made no official sounds in her 
Erection.” 

“Ahh, but I did.” 

“You what?” 

“I put her on official notice.” 
“McKie, you were told to han- 
dle this with dis — ” 

“Look, we want her to start of- 
ficial action. Check with legal. She 
can try a countersuit against me 
personally. But if she moves 
against the Bureau we can ask for 
seratori hearing, a personal con- 
frontation. Her legal staff wilt a4* 
vise her of that. No, she’ll try to 
get at— ” 

“She may not go into court 
against the Bureau,” Siker said, 
“but she’s certain to set her dogs 
on us. And it couldn’t come at a 
worse time. Bildoon has just about 
used up his ego-time. He’ll be go- 
ing into the creche any time now. 
You know what that nieans.” 

“The Bureau Director’s chair 
up for grabs,” McKie said. “I’ve 
been expecting it.” 

“Yes, but matters will be in a 
real uproar around here.” 

“You’re eligible for the seat, 
Siker.” 

“So are you, McKie.” 

“Ipass.” 

“That’ll be the day. What I’m 
worried about is Bildoon. He’ll 
blow when he hears about this 
ego-frozen Pan Spechi. That 
might be all it takes to — ” 

“He’ll handle it,” McKie said, 
putting more confidepce into the 
statement than he felt. 

“And you could be wrong. I 



hope you know I’m not passing.” 
“We all know you want the 
job,” McKie said. 

“I can imagine the gossip.” 

“Is it worth it?” 

“I’ll let you know.” 

“I’m sure you will.” 

“One thing,” Siker said. “How 
are you going to keep Abnethe off 
your back?” 

“I’m going to become a school 
teacher,” McKie said. 

- “I don’t think I want that ex- 
plained,” Siker said. 

He broke the contact. 

M CKIE found himself still 
seated in the purple gloom of 
the Beachball. Sweat bathed his 
body. The place was an oven. He 
wondered u his fat actually were 
being reduced by the heat. 
Water loss, certainly. The instant 
he thought of water he sensed dry- 
ness in his throat. 

“You still there,” he rasped. 
Silence. 

“Fanny Mae?” 

I remain in my home, the Cale- 
ban said. 

The sensation that he heard the 
words without hearing grated on 
McKie, fed on the angeret in his 
system, stirred a latent rage. 

“Are you willing to cooperate 
with us in trying to stop these flog- 
gings?” Mcfoe asked. 

As my contract permits. 

“All right. Then you insist to 
Abnethe that you want me as your 
teacher.” 

You perform functions of teach- 
er? 

“Have you learned anything 
from me?” McKie asked.

IF 




All mingled connectives in- 
struct. 

“Connectives,” McKie mut- 
tered. “I must be getting old.” 

Explain old. 

“Never mind. We should have 
discussed your contract first thing. 
Maybe there’s a way to break it. 
Under what laws was it exe- 
cuted?” 

Explain laws. 

“V^at honorable system of en- 
forcement?” McKie blared. 

Under natural honor of sentient 
connectives. 

“Abnethe doesn’t know what 
honor means.” 

I understand honor. 

McKie sighed. 

“Were there witnesses, signa- 
tures, that sort of thing?” 

AH my fellow Calebans witness 
connectives. Signatures not under- 
stood. Explain. 

McKie decided not to explore 
the concept of signatures. 

Instead he asked, “Under what 
circumstances could you refuse to 
honor your contract with Ab- 
nethe?” 

After a prolonged pause, the. 
Caleban said. Changing circum- 
stances convey varQ>ie relation- 
ships. Should Abnethe fail in her 
connectives or attempt redefini- 
tion of essences, this could pro- 
duce linearities open for my disen- 
tanglement. 

“Sure,” McKie said. “That fig- 
ures.” 

He shook his head, studied the 
empty air above the giant spoon. 
Calebans. You couldn’t see them, 
couldn’t hear them, couldn’t un- 
derstand them. 



Is the use of your S’eye system 
available to me?” McKie ask^. 

You function as my teacher. 

“Is that a yes?” 

A ffirmative answer. 

“Affirmative answer,” McKie 
echoed. “Fine. Can you also trans- 
port objects for me, sending them 
where I direct?” 

While connectives remain ap- 
parent. 

“I hope'that means what I think 
it does,” McKie said. “Are you 
aware of the Palenki arm and 
whip over there on your floor?” 

Aware. 

“I want them sent to a partic- 
ular office at Central. Can you do 
that?” 

Think of office. 

McKie o^yed. 

Connectives available, the Cale- 
ban said. You desire sending to 
place of examination. 

“That’s right!” 

Send now? 

“At once.” 

Once, yes. Multiple sending re- 
mains outside our capabilities. 

“Huh?” 

Objects going. 

A S MCKIE blinked, the arm and 
whip snapped out of his view 
accompanied by a sharp crack of 
exploding air. 

“Do the Taprisiots work in any 
way similar to what you do in 
transporting things?” 

Message transportation minor 
energy level, the Caleban said. 
Beautybarbers even more minor. 

“I guess so,” McKie said. 
“Well, never mind. There’s the 
little matter of my friend, Ali-

cheno Funineo, though. You- sent 
him home, I believe?” 

Correct. 

“You sent him to the wrong 
home.” 

Credtures possess only one~ 
home, 

“We sentients have more than 
one tome.” 

But / view connectives! 

McKie felt the wash of radiant 
objection “from the Caleban, 
steadied himself. 

“No doubt,” he said. “But he 
has another home right here on 
Cordiality.” 

Astonishment fills me. 

“Probably. The question re- 
mains, can you correct this situa- 
tion?” 

Explain situation. 

“Can you send him to his home 
here on Cordiality?” 

Pause, then: That place not his 
home. 

“But«an you send him there?” 
You wish this? 

“I wish it.” 

Ypur friend converses through a 
Taprisiot. 

“Ah,” McKie said. “Can you 
listen in on his conversation?” 
Message content not available. 
Connectives visible. / possess 
awareness that your friend ex- 
changes communication with sen- 
tient of other species. 

“What species?” 

One you label Pan Spechi. 
“What’d happen if you sent 
Furuneo to — his home here on 
Cordiality right now?” 

Shattering of connectives. But 
message exchange concludes in 
this linearity. / send him. There. 



“You sent him?” 

By connectives you convey. 
“He’s here on Cordiality right 
now?” 

He occupies place not his 
-home. 

“I hope we’re together on that.” 
Your friend, the Caleban said, 
desires presence with you. 

“He wants to come here?” 
Correct. 

“Well why not? All right, bring 
him.” 

What purpose arises from 
friend’s presence in my home? 

“I want him to stay with you 
and watch for Abnethe while I 
attend to other business.” 

McKie? 

“Yes.” 

You possess awareness that pre- 
sence of yourself or other of your 
kind prolongs impingernent of 
myself upon your wave? 

“That’s fine.” 

Your presence foreshortens flog- 
ging. 

“I suspected as much.” 
Suspected? 

“I understand!” 

Understanding probable. Con- 
nectives indicative. 

“I can’t tell you how happy that 
makes me,” McKie said. 

You wish friend brought? 
“What’s Furuneo doing?” 
Furuneo exchanges communica- 
tion with — assistant. 

“I can imagine.” 

McKie shook his head from side 
to side. He could sense the morass 
of misunderstanding around every 
attempt- at communication here. 
No way to steer clear of it. No way 
at all. At the very moment when 



40 



IF 




they thought th6y had achieved 
closest communication — right then 
they could be widest of the mark. 

“When Furuneo concludes his 
conversation, bring him,” McKie 
said. 

He hunched back against the 
wall. The heat was almost unbear- 
able. Why did Calebans require 
such heat? Maybe, the heat repre- 
sented something ^Ise to a Cala- 
ban — a visible wave form, perhaps 
serving sonie function other senti- 
ents could not begin to under- 
stand? 

A WAVE of relatively cold air 
told McKie Fumneo had ar- 
rived. McKie turned, saw the 
planetary agent sprawled beside 
him and just beginning to sit up. 

“For the love of reason,” Fur- 
uneo shouted, “what are you do- 
ing to me?” 

“I needed the fresh air,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

Furuneo peered at him. 

“What?” 

“Glad to see you,” McKie said. 
“Yeah?” Furuneo brought him- 
self to a squatting position beside 
McKie. “You have any idea what’s 
just happened to me?” 

“You’ve been to Landy-B,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

“How did you know? Was that 
your doing?” 

“Slight misunderstanding,” Mc- 
kie said. “Landy-B’s your home.’’ 
“It is not.” 

“I’ll leave you to argue that 
with Fanny Mae,” Mcfee said. 
“Have you started the search on 
Cordiality?” 

“I barely got it going before 



you — ” ' 

“Yes, but you’ve started it?” 
“I’ve started it.” 

“Good. Fanny Mae will keep 
you posted on various things and 
bring your people here for re-

Won’t you, Fanny Mae?” 

Contract permits. 

“Good girl.” 

“I’d almost forgotten how hot 
it was in here,” Furuneo said, 
mopping his forehead. “So I can 
summon people. What else?” 

“You watch for Abnethe.” 
“And?” 

“The instant she and one of 
her Palenki floggers make an ap- 
pearance, you get a holoscan rec- 
ord of everything that happens. 
You do have your toolkit?” 

“Of course.” 

“Fine. While you’re scanning, 
get your instruments as close to 
the jumpdoor as you can.” 

“She’ll probably close the door 
as soon as she sees what I’m do- 
mg. 

“Don’t count on it. Oh, one 
thing.” 

“Yes?” 

“You’re my teaching assistant.” 
“Your what?” 

McKie explained about the 
Caleban’s agreement. 

“So she can’t get rid of us with- 
out violating the terms of her 
contract with Fanny Mae,” Fur- 
uneo said. “Cute.” He pursed his 
lips. “That all?” 

“No. I want you and Fanny 
Mae to discuss connectives.” 
“Convectives?” 

“Connectives. I want you to try 
finding out what in ten billion

devils a Caleban means by con- 
nectives.” 

“Connectives,” Furuneo said. 
“Is there any way to turn down 
the furnace in here?” 

“You might take that as an- 
other subject — try to discover the 
reason for all this heat.” 

“If I don’t melt first. Where’ll 
. you be?” 

“Hunting — provided Fanny 
Mae and I can agree on the con- 
.nectives.” 

“You’re not making sense.” 
“Right. But I’ll try to make 
tracks — if Fanny Mae’ll send me 
where the game is.” 

Furuneo said, “You could walk 
into a trap.” 

“Maybe. Fanny Mae, have you 
been listening?” 

Explain listening. 

“Never mind!” 

But mind possesses ever! 

McKie closed his eyes, swal- 
lowed. 

Then: “Fanny Mae, are you 
aware of the information ex- 
change just concluded between 
my friend and myself here?” 
Explain conclu — 

“Are you aware?” McKie bel- 
lowed. 

Amplification contributes little 
to communication, the Caleban 
said. / possess desired awareness 
—presumably. 

“Presumably,” McKie mut- 
tered. Then: “Can you send me 
to a place near Abnethe where 
she will not be aware of me but 
where I can be aware of her?” 
Negative. 

“Why not?” 

Specific injunction of con-

tract. 

“Oh.” McKie bent his head in 
thought. “Well, can you send me 
to a place where I might become 
aware of Abnethe through my 
own efforts?” 

Possibility. Permit examination 
of connectives. \ 

McKie waited. The heat was a 
tangible thing inside the Beach- 
ball, a solid intrusion on his 
senses. He saw it already was be- 
ginning to wilt Furuneo. 

“I saw my mother,” Furuneo 
said, noting McKie’s attention. 

“That’s great,” McKie said. 

“She was swimming with 
friends when the Caleban dump- 
ed me right in the pool with 
them. The water was wonderful.” 

“They were surprised, no 
doubt.” 

“They thought it was a great 
joke. I wish I knew how that 
S’eye system works.” 

“You and billions of others. 
The energy requirement gives 
me the chills.” 

“I could use a chill right now. 
You know, that’s one weird sen- 
sation — standing one minute talk- 
ing to old friends, the next instant 
yakking at empty air here on 
Cordiality. What do you suppose 
they think?” 

“They think it’s magic.” 

McKie, the Caleban said, I love 
you. 

“You what?” McKie exploded. 

Love you, the Caleban re- 
peated. Affinity of one person for 
another person. Such affinity 
transcends species. 

“I guess so but—” 



IF 




Since I possess this universal af- 
finity Jor your person, connectives 
open, permitting accomplishment 
of your request. 

“You can send me to a place 
near Abnethe?” 

Affirmative. Accord with desire. 
Yes. 

“Where is this place?” McKie 
asked. 

He found, with a chill wash of 
air and a sprawling lurch onto 
dusty ground, that he was address- 
ing his question to a moss-capped 
rock. For a moment he star^ at 
the rock, regaining his balance. 
The rock was about a meter tall 



and contmned small veins of yel- 
low-white quartz with flecks of 
reflective brilliance' scattered 
through them. It stood in an open 
meadow beneath d distant yellow 
sun. The sun’s position told 
McKie he had arrived either at 
mid-morning or mid-afternoon,

Beyond the rock the meadow 
and a ring of straggly yellow 
bushes stretched it flat'~horizon 
broken by the tall white spires of 
a city.

HARRY HARRISON 

■y THE 
FALLS 



He could only achieve the 
impossible. The possible 
was forever beyond him . 



I T WAS the rich damp grass, 
slippery as soap, covering the 
path, that caused Carter to keep 
slipping and failing, not the steep- 
ness of the hill. The front of his 
raincoat was wet and his knees 
were muddy long before he 
reached the summit. And with each 
step forward and upward the con- 
tinuous roar of souiid grew louder. 
He was hot and tired by the time 
he reached the top of the ridge — 
yet he instantly forgot his discom- 
fort as he looked out across the 
wide bay. 

Like everyone else he had heard 
about The Falls since childhood 
and had seen countless photo- 
graphs and films of them on tele- 
vision. Ail this preparation had not 
readied him for the impact of 
reality. 

He saw a falling ocean, a ver- 
tical river — how many millions of 
gallons a second did people say 
came down? The Falls stretched 
out across the bay, their farthest 
reaches obscured by the clouds 
of floating spray. The bay seethed 
and boiled with the impact of that 
failing weight, raising foam- 
capped waves that crashed against 
the rocks below. Carter could feel 
the impact of the water on the 
solid stone as a vibration in the 
ground but all sound was swal- 
lowed up in the greater roar of 
The. Falls. This was a reverbera- 
tion so outrageous and overpower- 
ing that his ears could not be- 
come accustomed to it. They soon 



felt numbed from the ceaseless im- 
pact but the very bones of the skull 
carried the sound to his brain, 
shivering and battering it. When 
he put his hands over his ears he 
was horrified to discover that The 
Falls were still as loud as ever. As 
he stood swaying and wide-eyed 
one of the constantly changing 
air currents that formed about the 
base of The Falls shifted suddenly 
and swept a wall of spray down 
upon him. The inundation lasted 
scant seconds but was heavier than 
any rainfall he had ever exper- 
ienced, had ever believed possible. 
When it passed he was gasping for 
air, so dense had been the falling 
water. 

Quivering with ^nsations he 
had never before experienced. 
Carter turned and looked along 
the ridge toward the gray and 
water-blackened granite of the 
cliff and the house that huddled 
at its base like a stony blister. It 
was built of the same granite as the 
cliff and appeared no less solid. 
Running and slipping, his hands 
still over his ears. Carter hurried 
toward the house. 

For a short -time the spray was 
blown across the bay and out to 
sea, so that golden afternoon sun- 
light poured down on the house, 
starting streamers of vapor from 
its sharply sloping roof. It was a 
no-nonsense building, as solid as 
the rock against which it pressed. 
Only two windows penetrated the 
blankness of the front that faced 

45 



BY THE FALLS 




The Falls — tiny and deep, they 
were like little suspicious eyes. No 
door existed here but Carter saw 
that a path of stone flags led 
around the corner. 

/ He followed it and found — set 
into the wall on the far side, away 
from The Falls — a small and deep- 
set entry. It had no arch but was 
shielded by a great stone lintel a 
good two feet in diameter. Carter 
stepped into the opening that 
framed the door and looked in 
vain for a knocker on the heavy, 
iron-bolted timbers. The unceas- 
ing, world-filling, thunder of The 
Falls made thinking almost im- 
possible and it was only after he 
had pressed uselessly against the 
sealed portal that he realized that 
no knocker, even one as loud as 
cannon, could be heard within 
these walls above that sound. He 
lowered his hands and tried to 
force his mind to coherence. 

There had to be some way of an- 
nouncing his presence. When he 
stepped back out of the alcove he 
noticed that a rusty iron knob was 
set into the wall a few feet away. 
He seized and twisted, it but it 
would not turn. However, when 
he pulled on it, although it re- 
sisted, he was able to draw it slow- 
ly away from the wall to disclose a 
length of chain. The chain was 
heavily greased and in good con- 
dition — a fair omen. He continued 
to pull until a yard of chain 
emerged from the opening and 
then, no matter how hard he 



pulled, no more would come. He 
released the handle and it bounced 
against the rough stone of the wall. 
For sortie instants it hung there. 
Then with a jerky mechanical 
motion, the chain was drawn back 
into the wall until the knob once 
more rested in place. 

W hatever device this odd mech- 
anism activated seemed to 
perfornt its desired function. In 
less than a minute the heavy door 
swung open and a man appeared 
in the opening. He examined his 
visitor wordlessly. 

The man who was much like 
the building and the cliffs behind 
it — solid, no-nonsense, worn, lined 
and graying. But he had resisted 
the years even as he showed their 
marks upon him. His back was as 
straight as any young man’s and 
his knob-knuckled hands had a 
look of determined strength. Blue 
were his eyes and very much the 
color of the water falling endlessly, 
thunderously, on the far side of the 
building. He wore knee-high fish- 
erman’s boots, plain corduroy 
pants and a boiled gray 'sweater. 
His face did not change expression 
as he waved Carter into the 
building. 

When the thick door had been 
swung shut and the many sealing 
bars shoved back into place the si- 
lence in the house took on a qual- 
ity of its own. Carter had known 
absence of sound elsewhere — here 
was a positive statement of no-

IF 




sound, a bubble ^of peace pushed 
right up against the very base of 
the all-sound of The Falls. He was 
.momentarily deafened and he 
knew it. But he was not so deaf 
that he did not know that the ham- 
mering thunder of The Falls had 
been shut outside. The other man 
must have sensed how his visitor 
felt. He nodded in a reassuring 
manner as he took Carter’s coat, 
then pointed to a comfortable 
chair set by the deal table near the 
fire. Carter sank gratefully into the 
cushions. His host turned away 
and vanished, to return a moment 
later with a tray bearing a de- 
canter and two glasses. He poured 
a measure of wine into each glass 
and set one down before Carter, 
who nodded and seized it in both 
hands to steady their shaking. 
After a first large gulp he sipped at 
it while the tremors died and his 
hearing slowly returned. His host 
moved about the room on various 
tasks and presently Carter found 
himself much recovered. He 
looked up. 

“I must thank you for your hos- 
pitality. When I came in I was 
— shaken.” 

“How are you now? Has the 
wine helped?” the man said loudly, 
almost shouting, and Carter real- 
ized that his own words had not 
been heard. Of course, the man 
must be hard of hearing. It was a 
wonder he was not stone deaf. 

“Very good, thank you,” Carter 
shouted back. “Very kind of you 



indeed. My name is Carter. I’m a 
reporter, which is why I have come 
to see you.” 

The man nodded, smiling slight- 

ly- 

“My name is Bodum. You must 
know that if you have come here 
to talk to me. You write for the 
newspapers?” 

“I was sept here.” Carter 
coughed — the shouting was irri- 
tating his throat. “And I of course 
know you, Mr. Bodum — that is I 
know you by reputation. You’re 
the Man by The Falls.” 

“Forty-three years now,” Bodum 
said with solid pride, “I’ve lived 
here and have never been away for 
a single night. Not that it has been 
easy. When the wind is wrong the 
spray is blown over the house for 
days and it is hard to breathe — 
even the fire goes out. I built the 
chimney myself — there is a bend 
part way up with baffles and 
doors. The smoke goes up — but if 
water comes down the baffles stop 
it and its weight opens the doors 
and it drains away through a pipe 
to the outside. I can show you 
where it drains — black with soot 
the wall is there*.” 

While Bodum talked Carter 
looked around the room at the dim 
furniture shapes barely seen in the 
wavering light from the fire and at 
the two windows set into the wall. 

“Those Windows,” he said, “You 
put them in yourself? May I look 
out?” 

“Took a year apiece, each one.

Stand on ttiat bench. It will bring 
you to the right level. They’re 
armored glass, specially made, 
solid as the wall around them now 
that I have them anchored well. 
Don’t be afraid. Go right up to it. 
The window’s safe. Look how the 
glass is anchored.” 

C ARTER was not looking at 
the glass but at The Falls out- 
side. He had not realized how close 
the building was to the falling 
water. It was perched on the very 
edge of the cliff and nothing was 
to be seen from this vantage point 
except the wall of blackened wet 
granite to his right and the foam- 
ing maelstrom of the bay far be- 
low. And before him, above him, 
filling space. The Falls. All the 
thickness of wall and glass could 
not cut out their sound completely 
and when he touched the heavy 
pane with his fingertips he could 
feel the vibration of the water’s 
impact. 

The window did not lessen the 
effect The Falls had upon him but 
it enabled him to stand and watch 
and think, as he had been unable 
to do on the outside. It was very 
much like a peephole into a holo- 
caust of water — a window into a 
cold hell. He could watch without 
being destroyed — but the fear of 
what was on the other side did not 
lessen. Something black flickered 
in the falling water and was gone. 

“There — did you see that,” he 
called out. “Something came down 

48 



The Falls. What could it possibly 
be?” 

Bodiim nodded wisely. “Over 
forty years I have been here and I 
can show you what comes down 
The Falls.” He thrust a splint into 
the fire and lit a lamp from it. 
Then, picking up the lamp, he 
waved Carter after him. They 
crossed the room and he held the 
light to a large glass bell jar. 

“Must be twenty years ago it 
washed up. on the shore. Every 
bone in its body broke too. Stuffed 
an<f mounted it myself.” 

Carter pressed close, looking at 
the staring shoe-button ^es and 
the gaping jaws and pointed teeth. 
The limbs were stiff and unnatu- 
ral, the body under the fur bulging 
in the wrong places. Bodum was 
by no means a skilful taxidermist. 
Yet, perhaps by accident, he had 
captured a look of terror in the 
animal’s expression and stance. 

“It’s a dog,” Carter said. “Very 
much like other dogs.” 

Bodum was offended, his voice 
as cold as shout can be. “Like 
them, perhaps, but not of them. 
Every bone broken I told you. 
How else could a dog have ap- 
peared here in this bay?” 

“I’m sorry, I did not mean to 
suggest for an instant — Down The 
Falls, of course. I just meant it is 
so much like the dogs we have 
that perhaps there is a whole new 
world up there. Dogs and every- 
thing, just like ours.” 

“I never speculate,” Bodum 



IF 




said, mollified. “I’ll make some 
coffee.” 

He took the lamp to the stove 
and Carter, left alone in the par- 
tial darkness went back to the 
window. It drew him. “I must ask 
you some questions for my arti- 
cle,” he said but did not speak 
loudly enough for Bodum to hear.' 
Everything he had meant to do 
here seemed irrelevant as he 
looked out at The Falls. The wind 
shifted. The spray was briefly 
blown clear and The Falls were 
once more a mighty river coming 
down from the sky. When he 
canted his head he saw exactly as 
if he were looking across a river. 

And there, upstream, a ship ap- 
peared, a large liner with rows of 
portholes. It sailed the surface of 
the river faster than ship had ever 
sailed before and he had to jerk 
his head to follow its motion. 
When it passed, no more than a 
few hundred yards away, for one 
instant he could see it clearly. The 
people aboard it were hanging to 
the rails, some with their mouths 
open' as though shouting in fear. 
Then it was gone and there was 
only the water, rushing endlessly 
by. 

“Did you see it?” Carter shouted, 
spinning about. 

“The coffee will be ready soon.” 

“There, out there,” Carter cried, 
taking Bodum by the arm. “In The 
Falls. It was a ship, I swear it was, 
falling from up above. With peo- 
ple on it. There must be a whole 



world up there that we know noth- 
ing about.” 

B odum reached up to the shelf 
for a cup, breaking Carter’s 
grip with the powerful movement 
of his arm. 

“My dog came down The Falls. 
I found it and stuffed it myself.” 
“Your dog, of course. I’ll not 
deny that. But there were people 
on that ship and I’ll swear — I’m 
not mad — that their skins were a 
different color from ours.” 

“Skin is skin, just skin color.” 

“I know. That is what we have. 
But it must be possible for skins 
to be other colors, even if we dbn’t 
know about it.” 

“Sugar?” 

“Yes, please. Two.” 

Carter sipped at the coffee — it 
was strong and warm. In spite of 
himself he was drawn back to the 
window. He looked out and sipped 
at the coffee — and started when 
something black and formless 
came down. And other things. He 
could not tell what they were be- 
cause the spray was blowing to- 
ward the house again. He tasted 
grounds at the bottom of his cup 
and left the last sips. He put the 
cup carefully aside. 

Again the eddying wind currents 
shifted the screen of spray to one 
side just in time for him to see an- 
other of the objects go by. 

“That was a house! I saw it as 
clearly as I see this one. But wood

these nightly events is that you 
park on the shore and since the 
submarines are submerged there’s 
nothing to see. So you neck. 

I had been at the university for 
years, first as an undergraduate, 
then as a graduate student and 
teaching assistant and finally as 
an A.B.D. That is, I have all but 
my dissertation toward a Ph.D., 
the college professor’s union card. 
What with teaching and serving 
on a dozen committees and being 
conscientious about student activ- 
ities and dabbling in politics (I 
ran for the city council and lost to 
a man whose parentage and mixed 
marriage appealed to the three 
biggest ethnic groups in town), I 
had no time to finish the disserta- 
tion. 

Then 1 won a fellowship. I in- 
terested the Guggenheims in re- 
search I was doing on Stephen 
Crane’s lost manuscripts. Crane 
had been a stringer for some up- 
state papers and during his brief 
stay on campus he’d lived at the 
Delta Upsilon house. There were 
fragntents of his work around, 
waiting to be identified. 

The dean of faculties granted 
me a leave of absence and I 
rented an old farmhouse about an 
hour’s ride north of town. I didn’t 
know then that the farm sat on the 
western slope of Tug Hill. I didn’t 
even know then that there was a 
place called Tug Hill. Neither do 
most people — they refer to it 
vaguely as the snow belt or that 



good trout stream country up 
there. Mostly they’re talking 
about the edges of the Tug Hill 
Upland (or Escarpment, as the 
geologists say)^places like Or- 
well, Smartville, Osceola, New 
Boston, Constableville or Turin. 
These are villages and hamlets — 
not big but at least occupied. 
Nothing occupies Tug Hill proper 
except snowshde rabbits, deer, 
secondary growth-^and me. 

How this came .about is that my 
old friend, the assistant dean of 
liberal arts, whose name is Mel 
Oliphant and .who bowls every 
week with Jerry Boyd, the assist- 
ant director of research and devel- 
opment, drove up to my rented 
farm one September Saturday 
with a six-pack of cold beer. Mel 
and I climbed one of the drumlins 
that came with the place and 
looked out over the countryside to 
where Lake Ontario shimmered 
on the western horizon. He asked 
me how things were going. 

“Just fine,’’ I told him. Except, 
I said, that maybe I’d been ill- 
advised to specialize in the unpub- 
lished writings of Stephen Crane. 
“A lot of it is pretty crude, with 
just a nugget here and there to 
foreshadow the greatness.’’ 

Actually, most of what I’d 
found was discouraging. 

Mel tried to cheer me up. He 
got me to admit that I’d come 
across a line here and a paragraph 
there which Crane had apparently 
reworked later into The Blue Ho- 



52 



IF 




tel or The Red Badge or The 
Black Riders. I did get excited 
then, remembering, and quoted a 
paragraph Fd found in an 1891 is- 
sue of the university newspaper 
and another fragment Fd ex- 
humed from a magazine ^f liter- 
ary pretensions that had been put 
out by the brothers of Delta Upsi- 
lon. The magazine piece was 
signed S.C. and although records 
showed that in the nineties there’d 
been another DU named Sherman 
Caldwell I was fairly certain Fd 
recognized the Crane touch. 

“Did Caldwell publish anything 
else?” Mel asked. 

I told him Fd have to research 
that next time I was in town. 

“Let me do it for you,” he said. 
“Fve got an eager new grad as- 
sistant. Fve also got a proposition 
for you if you’re not tied up in a 
long-term lease.” 

I told him I rented on a month- 
to-month basis. 

“This may not interest an ex- 
alted Guggenheim fellow-^” 

“Cut it ouL Mel,” 1 told him. 
He’s a summa cum laude from 
Brown and the youngest college 
dean south of the snow belt. 

He said: “No kidding — our 
boss couldn’t be more pleased if 
he’d got the fellowship himself. 
You’re one- third of all the Gug- 
genheims on campus this year, 
you k'now.” 

Then Mel told me about the 
job R&D had. “Easy work, room 
and board included. Lots of time 



for your own project. The only 
thing is, it’s right in the middle of 
Tug Hill. Nowhere, in other 
words. You’d be a hermit.” 

1 didn’t have to think about it 
long. 

“Suits me,” I said. “Outside of 
my weekly trip to the general store 
and maybe to a movie Fm al- 
ready a hermit. But what’s Tug 
Hill?” 

Mel hadn’t known either until 
Jerry Boyd told him, so he was 
full »of fresh information. I was 
fascinated. I turned my back on 
Lake Ontario to stare east. But 
all I could see was Jerry Look 
Road (dirt) at the foot of my 
rented drumlin and a scrub forest 
rising behind it. 

“Will they bring beer with my 
provisions?” I asked. “This is a 
local-option township. I have to 
go clear to Richland for a ^six- 
pack — but Tug Hill sounds like 
Carry Nationsville.” 

“Fm sure that can be part of 
the deal.” 

We wandered down to the 
brook where we’d left the last two 
cans to cool and drank them, 
talking and watching a herd of 
cows pastured at the farm; for the 
summer. Then, since Mel| wasn’t 
spending the night, we drove both 
cars to Pulaski and had dinner. I 
went back to the farm $nd did 
some work, then went to bed.

gear in the basement had needed 
no attention since it was installed. 

1 did, though. In my first few 
months at Tug Hill I went from- 
being a loner who thought the 
solitary job was what I’d been 
looking for all my life to a man 
who thought he’d go crazy wait- 
ing for the next arrival of the cop- 
ter. 

April was the cruelest month. 
The radio told me it was a bew- 
bew-beautiful day in Watertown 
but I looked out on an eerie land- 
scape. Snow covered the lee sides 
of hills and mist rising from them 
moved in a slight wind. The mist 
drifted over everything and the 
cloud-shrouded sun gave it just 
enough substance to invest it with 
menace, as if something else might 
be drifting with it. The ghosts of 
residents past, I thought. The 
daunted pioneers, the discouraged 
settlers, the disappoint^ explor- 
ers. I was sick to death of winter. 

I was restive, Spring was stirring 
within me and I felt like going to 
the submarine races. I felt like 
telling R&D I wanted out, to get 
itself another boy. Instead I made 



myself a cheese sandwich, heavy 
on the mustard, drank a beer and 
tried to console myself with Crane. 

I hadn’t been doing much with 
the Crane project, though I’d had 
all the time in the world. My 
R&D duties occupied me two 
hours a day. The job was a sine- 
cure but I could see why it had 
been hard to fill. No family man 
would sign up for a year away 
from the wife and kids. Nor would 
it entice any healthy young chap 
who liked the submarine races. I 
wondered myself whether I could 
stick it out, though the worst was 
behind me — the incredible noth- 
ing of a winter in Tug Hill. No 
one had told me it was normal for 
the snow to be up to the level of 
the high windows of the trmler six 
months out of the year. One unbe- 
lievable day I had to tunnel from 
the door to the windswept knoll 
where the ski-equipped helicopter 
landed. 

Now the leaves were coming 
out. The juices were stirring in me, 
too. My contract ran to the end of 
September and I supposed I’d 
keep my word to R&D. The job 
was part of a classified govern- 
ment project. I’d been given just 
enough information to enable me 
to handle it. It was obvious that 
the work was connected with the 
space program and at first I 
thought I was sending signals to a 
-satellite and recording the bounce- 
back. But that wasn’t it. 

Gradually it dawned on me that 

IF 



54 




I was talking to the stars. Or try- 
ing to. The signals I sent out once 
a day were Earth’s attempt to find 
somebody intelligent out there in 
the void. 

I knew there was at least one 
other station doing the same thing 
and maybe there were many. I’d 
read about the pioneering West 
Virginia project, Ozma, named for 
the princess in The Wizard of Oz. 
What did they call me? I won- 
dered. The Tin Woodman? The 
Hermit of Tug Hill? And whom 
was I supposed to be talking to? 
Another person like me? A ma- 
chine? 

I didn’t know at first what my 
messages said but I imagined 
they’d been pretty carefully 
thought out. One plus one equals 
two. The square of the hypotenuse 
is equal to the sum of the squares 
of the other two sides. E equals 
mc^. All mathematical. 

It was dull stuff to me, an ex- - 
English lit major who took as few 
math courses as^ the degree re- 
quirements permitted. It could be 
dull for them out there, too, if 
anyone were listening. 

I didn’t suppose our signal en- 
coders had put much faith in 
Chaucer or Shakespeare or Crane. 
But by spring I was asking myself 
why not use a line or two from our 
glorious heritage of language? 
Shouldn’t the people out-there, if 
there are any, hear some of the 
best we’ve got? They couldn’t all 
be mathematicians. 



Why not send a bit of Chaucer? 
It would seem appropriate to the 
nature of the experiment to beam 
a few words from The Canterbury 
Tales: 

What is this world? whatasketh 
man to have? 

Now with his love, now in his 
colde grave 

A Hone, with~outen any 
companye. 

They might have the answer 
out there. Or send some Stephen 
Crane: 

A man said to the universe: 
"Sir, I exist!" 

Perhaps omit what the cynical 
Stephen imagined to be the uni- 
verse’s reply: 

"However," replied the universe, 

"The fact has not created in nie 
A sense of obligation. " 



T he messages were transmitted 
in a narrow beam, with no in- 
terference from man-made noise* 
You can’t get that kind of pure 
projection from just anywhere. Ex- 
cept for what went up from my 
trailer the only sounds Tug Hill 
produced were nature’s own. The 
humming of the bee, the soughing 
of the wind in the leaves, the chirp 
of the bird. And, occasionally, 
when I went out to lie on my back

and stare up into the infinity of 
stars, the lonely voice of me. Hey, 
up there — hey . 

And I found myself writing 
messages to aliens. 

That’s inexact. I was writing to 
one alien, an extraterrestrial and, 
because I was the kind of person 
I was, I imagined my unknown 
friend to be female and young and 
attractive. Therefore one of the 
givens, as we academic types say, 
was that she was human. I didn’t 
think I’d fln<) much joy in a saur- 
ian or a scaly sea-creature or a 
spider-lady, however compl«nen- 
tary our minds might be. 

At first I wrote the messages 
but didn’t send them. I couldn’t, 
at that stage, because I didn’t 
know how. My job was so simple 
that all I had to do was flick 
switches, adjust dials and make a 
few log entries that even an 
A.B.D. in liberal arts could be 
trusted to do. I supposed it could 
have been done by remote con- 
trol, electronically, but probably 
R&D didn’t yet rely on machines 
to that extent. I had never asked 
many questions about my job ex- 
cept to get the overview. 

But I watched carefully the 
next time a young technician col- 
lected and replaced the tapes and 
copied the log. It was a fine day 
and after he’d done his work he 
wasn’t anxious to get right back. 
Without seeming to, I brought the 
conversation around to the equip- 
ment he had serviced. He probab- 



ly thought it was idle shop talk. I 
learned a great deal. After he 
flew back I went over it in my 
mind. 

The message beam from Earth 
went out for 'one hour a day — at 
9 a.m., saying exactly the same 
thing, stopping always at the 
same time. This punctuality and 
repetition, I assumed, were an 
important part of the transmis- 
sion. If I were monitoring another 
section oflfie galaxy and it were 
sending at constant intervals for 
an exact length of time — even 
though the length of our days were 
different and the transmission gib- 
berish — I’d get the message that 
somebody was trying to strike up 
an intelligent conversation with an 
intergalaetic pal. 

Earth’s message to the stars 
wasn’t monitored by the senders — 
you don’t need a record of what 
you yourself are saying, especially 
when you say the same thing over 
and over. I’d also understood 
from the technician that Earth 
listening stations were all over the 
globe and that my little installa- 
tion couldn’t measure up to most. 
Still, it has been fitted with a piece 
of sophisticated new equipment 
R&D was trying out. 

So Tug Hill listened for an hour 
a day, late in th« afternoon. That 
was the other part of my job, to 
switch on the monitor at 4 P.M. 
There was a fair-sized dish anten- 
na set up in a natural bowl about 
a mile from the trailer. I’d never 



56 



IF 




known it was there — my techni- 
cian friend pointed it out during 
our talk. 

At any rate I now knew enough 
about the equipment to start 
playing with it. 

II 

I WANT to emphasize here that 
what I did in no way interfered 
with the R&D project. I merely 
supplemented it in my own hu- 
manisticway. 

To start with, I put messages 
from old Geoffrey Chaucer 4tnd 
young Stephan Crane on tape. I 
used my best lecture-hall voice. I 
didn’t know how to encode it so it 
would sound like that mathemati- 
cal stuff, nor would I have wanted 
it to sound that way. It seemed to 
me that the R&D people were 
underestimating the aliens by 
sticking to mathematics. For all 
their modern equipment they 
were merely using a variation of a 
19th century notion I’d read 
about. Gauss, the German physi- 
cist, had Wanted to plant hun- 
dreds of miles of 4rees on the Si- 
berian tundra in the form of a 
Pythagorean triangle for the aliens 
to see. I didn’t think R&D was 
doing much better. 

One Tuesday morning in July,- 
after I’d disconnected the official 
transmission, I sent my voice and 
the thoughts of Chaucer and 
Crane out into space. I began to 
keep a personal log as part of my 



journal, in which I’d been making 
only desultory entries. 

I was nervous the first time and 
left my tape on for no more than 
five minutes. 

Later in the day, after wander- 
ing around outside, kicking at 
low clumps of sun-faded grass 
and eating handfuls of wild blue- 
berries, I went back and remade 
the tape, reversing the order of 
the quotations and opening with 
a line from William Saroyan. 

I put that on the beam the sec- 
ond day, at 10:05 A.M., for ten 
minutes. Getting bolder, you see. 
I ran it at that time for the rest 
of the week. Then, on Sunday, I 
replaced it with a longerjcnessage, 
expanding Chaucer and adding 
Shakespeare .and Keats. (The 
poetry of earth is never dead . .) 
I let that one run for twenty-five 
minutes, from 10:05 to 10:30, for 
seven days. 

Meanwhile I’d decided to talk 
to the stars in my own words. 

No harm in that, I told myself. 
At worst I was using up a few 
minutes of power but whh three 
generators available R&D could 
spare it. At best I was providing 
a new avenue of communication 
with the putative aliens who, for 
all anyone knew, might be more 
word than number-oriented. Cer- 
tainly I would be if I were a lis- 
tener. Even if I didn’t know the 
lanuage I might sense the poetry. 

My own words, I knew, 
wouldn’t rival Keats’ or Shake-

spcare’s or even Crane’s or Saro- 
yan’s. But they would reflect the 
human microcosm that I was. As 
such they might just evoke a hu- 
man response in a far-off listener. 
I told myself this in justification 
for the unethical thing I was do- 
ing. It was my rationalization but 
not my reason. 

My reason was simply that I 
had to coipmunicate with some- 
body. If I’d had a girl who meant 
anything to me I’d probably have 
written to her instead . 

But no such correspondent was 
available, so I chose an unknown 
space lady, imagining her as a 
sympathetic person of mature 
(say 25 to *28) years who stood 
flve-three and was as propor- 
tioned as all get-out, in a terres- 
trial way, but who had, withal, an 
intelligence that wouldn’t bore 
me. 

I spent a lot of time on drafts 
of my message. I threw them all 
away because they looked as if 
I’d worked hard at them instead 
of saying what I really meant. So 
I started over and it came out 
easily because I was talking about 
what I was doing and how I got 
here and about Tug Hill. A lot. of 
it was what I’ve already written. 

I began reading into the tape. 

“If you get off the New York 
State Thruway at the Rome exit 
and head north ...” 

And that was what I transmit- 
ted to anyone out there who might 
be listening. 



The next afternoon I began tap- 
ing where I’(il left off and' trans- 
mitted that. It was as representa- 
tive of me, and therefore of Earth 
(because I was of Earth) as any- 
thing I could haVe composed 
specifically for the starcast — so I 
read the aliens my journal in 
ten-minutes installments, conclud- 
ing very soon that it wasn’t half 
bad for that purpose. And one day 
I had an answer. 



I SAY “an answer” as if the 
message replied tlirectly to me. 
It didn’t. What came in was the 
voice of one intelligent human be- 
ing speaking to another — but I 
don’t want to mislead you into 
thinking it said anything like, 
“Hello,"^ Walter; Yours of recent 
date received and contents noted 
...” But it did tell me as clearly 
as if the speaker were at my elbow 
that an individual out there — and 
not a member of some R&D 
team — ^was saying something to 
another individual. It was a per- 
son-to-person call, so to speak, 
not station-to-station. 

More than that — the person 
calling was a woman. 

Dear friend beyond the 
range of my present ac- 
quaintance — Greetihgs from 
one whose words may never 
bring a reply but who none- 
theless yearns to communi- 
cate. I have spoken to you

in the past but you may 
not have heard. If you have 
— I know you forgive the 
repetition. 

My time is short because 
I speak in many directions, 
the better to reach you 
wherever you are. But FU 
be back, - at what will be 
the same time of day for me, 
though for you it may vary 
by (word illegible). 

Please listen again, my 
friend. 

You can imagine my excite- 
ment. I played the tape over and 
over. The voice was that of a 
young woman — I felt confident 
of that — intelligent and intimate. 

She spoke again nine hours, 
four minutes and thirty-two sec- 
onds later. I hadn’t slept in the 
meantime. This time she said: 

Greetings, my friend 
across the void — it has been 
a day for me but probably 
a different interval for you. 
To be that alike would be 
too much to hope for. But 
We are alike in other ways — 
we must be if you hear me 
and understand. 

My time is short because 
I speak in many directions, 
the better to reach you 
wherever you are. 

I am happy today as the 
result of a visit from (word 
unclear). He tells me I am 
right to continue my quest. 



howeverothers may scornme. 

Listen again, my friend 
beyond. Please hear me. 

I glowed at her words. But I al- 
so found myself jealous of her 
other hearers on other worlds — 
and of her visitor. Think of that! 
I envied him his closeness to her 
and the regard in which she held 
him. I was probably a little nutty 
and overimaginative from lack 
of sleep, the season and my en- 
vironment but I felt strongly 
about her — and so record it in my 
journal. 

Before I could go to bed I had 
to get ready for my regular R&D 
transmission, to be followed by 
my clandestine one. 

The R&D beeps over with, I 
read the next segment of my 
journal into the tape and sent it 
off. I prefaced it, trembling, with 
the daring words: “Dear friend 
across the void.’’ It was as much 
as I could bring myself to impro- 
vise, feeling then — irrational from 
lack of sleep — that to say more 
would be to tempt the fates 
against me and jeopardize my 
tenuous contract. 

Then I slept, first having set 
my alarm for the interval that 
would wake me in time for her 
next message. 

She was there, on time to the 
second. I logged it in my journal 
as I listened: 

I greet you once more,

unknown friend from afar. 

If you’ve heard me 
speak before you’ll know 
that I am (unclear) of (un- 
clear). My time is short be- 
cause I speak in many di- 
rections, the better to reach 
you wherever you are. / 

Let me tell you about 
myself. I am called a Vem- 
ban. I am able to reproduce 
my kind, although I have 
not yet done so, with one of 
the other sex of my species. 
But this is in the future. My 
life partner and I have not 
yet chosen each other. 

Listen again, friend be- 
yond the stars.” 

I was jealous again, this time 
of the person of the other sex of 
her species who one day would 
help her reproduce her kind. 

Stung, I immediately prepared 
the tape of my next transmission 
and prefaced it with the words: 
”Never mind him. Star Girl; wait 
for me.” 

I went no further — I was ap- 
palled at my temerity in going 
that far — except to read the third 
extract from my journal. ^ 

O NE of the consolations of my 
being stuck in this uninhabited 
vas^tness had been that I had had 
time to read. I had been able to 
give some attention to questions 
of a scholarly nature, such as: 
Where did Tug Hill get its name? 



Well, you’d think to find the 
answer would be simple. But I’d 
read Adam Lascaris’s A Brief 
History of the North Country 
(Lowville Press, 1925) and Peter 
B. Felshaw’s privately printed 
monograph West of the Adiron- 
docks and East of Lake Ontario 
(1938?) and Martin McVickar’s 
Ordovician Ode (an undated epic 
preserved in the Lewis County 
Archives) and Fairchild Hovey’s 
nostalgic study. Snow Belt, which 
ran in several issues of the Water- 
Town Times in 1952. But not un- 
til I’d found a letter to the editor 
of the Syracuse Post-Standard y 
reprinted in a 1953 volume mark- 
ing the 150th anniversary of 
James C. Constable’s historic 
horseback ride did I get a hint. 

The writer of the letter was a 
professor emeritus of geography 
at Cazenovia College. He sug- 
gested that the name was asso- 
ciated with the fact that the area 
was once a lumbering center and 
pointed out that part of the 
harness of a work horse was a tug. 
Since the area abounded in hills 
everything had to be tugged in 
behind a horse. Therefore . 

Dear God (or whoever 
you revere. Star Girl), is 
this what I have on my 
mind? Is this all I can say 
to you when I long to share 
my innermost soul? 

I’m inhibited by our in- 
sufficient contact, of course.

by the possibility of eaves- 
droppers, by the suspicion 
that you don’t exist — that in 
my isolation I’ve made you 
up in iny mind. 

But this is the way I am, 
now at this point in time, 
and 1 won’t have you see me 
other than as I am — not if 
you’re who I hope you are. 
Star Girl — not if we are to 
know each other at what- 
ever impossible distance. 

Star Girl! Was I out of my 
cautious, expensively-educated 
mind? Was this scientific method? 
I was beginning to sound like 
somebody in a comic book or a 
Japanese monster movie. But I 
had to call her something. She 
told me she was a Veinban, what- 
ever that was, but she had no 
name I could speak. In the end I 
left my impetuous words on the 
tape. 

I went out and hiked the scrub- 
land, thinking only of her. 

Star Girl. Space Girl. Star- 
Space Girl. Stacy. Stacy, my love. 

Now wasn’t that absolutely ri- 
diculous? I beheaded a daisy with 
my boot, lost my balance and fell. 
I stayed down to inspect a circle 
of ferns at their own level, then 
lay back and stared into the sky, 
presumably in her direction. 

Stacy! 

I couldn’t help it. She was out 
there somewhere. I’d heard her 
and maybe one day she’d hear me. 



A bee came by. Was it possible 
that the intelligent life which had 
developed on her planet (Vemba?) 
was bee-shaped? I couldn’t have 
loved a bee, no matter how com- 
patible our minds, but because 
Stacy might be one I suffered this 
one’s approach. It buzzed close, 
honey-hunting. Maybe Stacy was 
at this moment (between transmis- 
sions) staring up into her alien 
sky, beyond which lay me. 

Stacy! Are you thinking of me? 

My Earthbound bee hovered, 
buzzing comfortably, then darted 
off to a whole tJaisy and went to 
work. Its job was simple. Mine 
had been, too, until Stacy spoke. 
Now I was possessed. I was in 
love with a voice from infinity. 

Madness. 

Intelligent Earthman that I 
was, holder of an M.A., part-time 
apprentice scientist entrusted with 
an important experiment, gatherer 
of new knowledge. I’d gone crazy 
over a voice which, if I allowed 
myself to think rationally about it, 
must have come from so far off 
that its owner and I could never 
hope to meet. And my own voice, 
speaking its insignificant message, 
would reach no one until I was 
long departed. It was a clean 
miss. 

I rolled over on my stomach 
and stabbed out a hand to be- 
head the daisy the bee had lately 
left I missed. I cried then, into a 
clump of moss under my face. 

Stacy. I breathed into its bloom. 

61 



IF A MAN ANSWERS 




After a while I got up and went 
inside and listened over and over 
to the tapes of her three messages. 

Oh, my girl. Oh, my friend. Oh, 
my impossible love . 



I WRITE more calmly today (an 
entry read). Thumbing back in 
my journal, I see that at times I’ve 
been overemotional, not to say of 
my mind, while at other times I’ve 
written calculatingly, addressing a 
“you” as if posterity would be in- 
terested in every detail of my 
small adventure. 

Am I beginning to see in my- 
self a historical figure like Con- 
stable, the early explorer of this 
outlier of , the Appalachian Pla- 
teau? (“Outlier” is a geographer’s 
term I’ve picked up.) Constable, 
having ridden horseback along 
hundreds of miles of wilderness 
trail, remarked to his own note- 
book that twenty-six miles in 
eight hours was pretty good speed, 
l^tacy’s voice, preserved here 
light-years from its source on 
Vemba, wherever that is, has also 
traveled at a good speed. And 
my voice? Is it being heard? 

It says in the books that James’ 
ancestor, William Constable, sold 
French emigres more than half a 
million acres somewhere up here. 
The plan was to build a little Paris 
in the heart of the Great Woods. 
That was in 1792. They were going 
to call it Castorland because of its 
potential fortune in beaver pelts. 



So there are precedents for one’s 
dreams. Is mine more fantastic 
than Constable’s? Instead of an 
outlier of old France, laid out 
like an architect’s dream, he has 
a hamlet of a handful of souls, 
named for him on a crossroads to 
nowhere. 

But I’m not trying to build a 
civilization, merely to reach one. 
Constable sought his in the wilder- 
ness of a young America — I seek 
mine in the ancient sky. 

From that sky again came her 
voice. 

Once a day I sit in the 
brief glow of noon and di- 
rect my thoughts to him 
who may hear. There is lit- 
tle more I can say. Most 
of the time now I merely 
exult in the brief blue heat 
which comforts me for so 
short a time. It is then, as I 
bask, that I permit myself 
to hope that in the lands be- 
yond this bleak world there 
lives one to whom I can 
speak. 

And in speaking, how 
shall I know that he will 
hear? Or hearing, under- 
stand? Or understanding, 
reply? 

I have none of the an- 
swers but I speak nonethe- 
less. It is my hope to speak 
to one like me, rather than 
to a creature of unrecogni- 
zable or incompatible form.

Preferably he should not be 
an insect or a quadruped or 
a scaly amphibian. 

If he is any of ^hese he 
may forgive me for being a 
lonely chauvinist. « 

It’s time to talk to Stacy again. 
Stacy the non-bee. Or is it my 
turn to listen for her? The inter- 
vals grow complicated and confus- 
ing. 1 must leave my journal and 
check my charts. 

I’m coming, Stacy! 

What shall I tell her? 

Dear Star Girl — ^we 
should know each- other, 
not just because our worlds 
must communicate for the 
good of science, for the ad- 
vancement of knowledge — 
but because I’m lonesome 
and maybe you are, too. 

There’s a time when 
nothing you have, or can 
foresee having, is quite 
enough. You yearn for 
more, even if what you need 
is unattainable, even if 
you’re reaching too far. 

How much farther could I reach 
than to Stacy? For all I knew she 
could be clamshaped or so alien 
that I would be unable even to 
comprehend her shape. But in my 
mind she was — she had to be— a 
desirable, lovely, slim girl with 
all the Earthlike qualities and 
gradations of form that make slim 
lovely girls desirable. I was in love 



with the Stacy I wanted her to be 
— though she might have died 
before I was born. 

Ill 

T hen there was silence. I 
heard the voice no longer. 
Had she spoken her last? Had she 
become bored with what could 
only have been a pastime? I had 
no answers. I could only speculate. 

Loneliness engulfed me. My 
sense of desolation increased ten- 
fold. Thinking that she might 
have altered her intervals of 
transmission, I listened for 
twenty-four hours without a 
break, drinking all the remaining 
beer and filling page after page 
with her name. 

Stacy, Stacy, Stacy . 

She was gone. The impossible 
contact had been broken. Ques- 
tioning my sanity and distrusting 
my journal entries, I played the 
tapes to convince myself that I 
had actually heard her. 

Without a fresh message from 
her to inspire me there was noth- 
ing for me to tell the sky. For a 
while I repeated the first tapes I 
had made — “Hello out there — ’’ 
but my heart wasn’t in them. I 
moped around, routinely sending 
R&D’s mathematical messages, 
doing my job and little else. I 
gave up shaving and ate only 
when hunger forced me to. I spent 
a lot of time sitting outside the 
trailer in the sun, doing absolutely

nothing. The only creative thought 
I had was that this was one of the 
few times in my life when I could 
get an allover suntan but I 
couldn’t muster the energy to take 
off my clothes, much less shave 
the beard, now two weeks thick 
and beginning to get greasy from 
sloppy eating. 

Then I heard a new voice. 

T’d gone back one more time 
and listened, certain I’d hear 
nothing, and prepared to slouch 
outside for a few more hours of 
vegetablelike absorption of sun- 
shine. 

The voice was clearer than the 
other had been. It tingled the 
back of my scalp. It said: 

Hello, down there, my 
friend on Tug Hill . 

Like the other, it spoke English. 
But this was that of a more con- 
temporary person. I knew it — 
there was a lilt, an air of excite- 
ment and purpose that the other 
had lacked. It was also a woman’s 
voice, or a girl’s. 

But the marvel was that she 
was speaking to me, her “friend 
on Tug Hill.’’ My skepticism 
fought that for a while — it was 
more than I could lo^cally ac- 
cept. But who else could she be 
talking to? The postmistress at' 
Lyons Falls? The ham operator in 
Port Leyden? No — I wouldn’t 
have it. 

This new Star Girl was speaking 



to me — to me and to no one else. 

Her message was short. I won- 
dered if she’d had to sneak it in 
after the official transmission, as 
I had done. 

I heard you speak and 
then you stopped. I hope 
you will speak again. I’ll be 
in touch with you several 
times again before . 

I must leave you now. 
There isn’t time. Listen 
bgain, you on Tug Hill. Do 
listen. And speak to me. 

My joy in the contact was tem- 
pered by her statement that our 
talks wolild be limited to “sever- 
al.’’ Why? 

There isn't time. 

What was happening? 

I was plunged into gloom. Had 
I reestablished communication on- 
ly to have it broken again? This 
would be too cruel. Bbt she had 
asked me to listen again. I reran 
the tape to verify that. 

'Listen again, you on Tug Hill. 
Do listen . 

I yelled and got up. I ran 
around like a wild man, knocking 
. things over, hurting myself. Hold- 
ing a painful elbow, I howled as 
if my sound could reach her with- 
out the transmitter. 

“Stacy! Stacy-Stacy-Stacy!’’ 

I grabbed the log book to see 
when my next transmission would 
be. Soon. I got up to pace back 
and forth, to think what to say.

As I passed the mirror over the 
wash basin I had a shock. The re- 
flection was of a filthy^ mad-eyed 
creature with matted hair and 
beard and grease-stained clothing. 

1 tore off my clothes and threw 
them out the door. Then showered 
and shaved. ^ 

N ever mind what I said to 
her. What matters is that I 
was clean and alive when 1 said it, 
and that later she replied. She said: 

Dear Friend on Tug Hill: 
I feel I know you well. I 
have heard your voice, al- 
though you did not address 
me then. And although I 
have another name Vd like 
to be your Stacy. Fm a 
lonesome one like you even 
if Fm surrounded by many 
like me. I envy your pri- 
vacy. 

Do you know who it was 
you talked to? Do you know 
the woman who spoke to 
you, not knowing you would 
hear but hoping someone 
would hear? She is a part of 
me. She is dead now, poor 
unfulfilled thing, sweet lady 
who lives in me. She died in 
her favorite place, in her 
garden, in the brief warmth 
of noon, with a smile I shall 
remember. I was there, a 
child at her feet on the sere 
grass, listening, as her words 
came to an end. 



She said this: ''I am old, 
child, and can hope no 
longer, but you may see a 
land my voice has reached. 
I can do no more and soon 
I will know what I have only 
imagined.” 

It was my grandmother's 
voice you heard and I bless 
you for answering her, 
though she never heard you. 
I answer for her. Will you 
speak to me now as you 
spoke to her? May I be your 
Space Girl, your Star Girl, 
your Stacy? 

, Would I? Might she? I caa't 
remember all I said but it was im- 
passioned and wild. I spoke to her 
directly — out of my heart, not my 
notebooks — and my message went 
out live. It’s probably just as well 
I have no transcript. Fd be em- 
barrassed to hear it played back. 
But I excused myself. I was an 
old friend of the family. Hadn’t I 
known her grandmother? 

She replied as openly, as warm- 
ly. 

Fm talking to you as I 
would to myself, Walter. 
That’s a compliment. It 
means you make me feel 
comfortable, as if Fd known 
you as long as I’ve known 
me. Oh, I do hope to meet 
you! Do you think they’ll let 
us? They must! We’ll see to 
it, won’t we? I won’t look be- 



IF A MAN ANSWERS

yond that. I must go. Til talk 
to you again. Speak to me! 

It was agony to have to wait for 
the next transmission. I had so 
many questions to ask. What did 
she mean about hoping to meet 
me? Was it possible? Would who 
let us? Was she— could she be— 
was it too much to believe that she 
was on her way to Earth from 
whatever land was hers? 

She answered my questions in 
her own way, possibly because her 
opportunities were limited — pos- 
sibly, I hoped, because she was as 
excited as I. 

I’m attracted to you, 
chance-chosen resident of 
Tug Hill. I think you’re at- 
tracted to me. I must identi- 
fy myself further so you 
won’t mistake me for one of 
the other females aboard the 
Forerunner I’d hate that. 
I’m me, Stacy, not one of 
them, though you might be 
misled. 1 must be sure you 
know me when we arrive — it 
can’t be otherwise. I’ll know, 
but how will you? Shall we 
have a password? A secret 
sign? A way of meeting? I’ll 
think about that between 
now and the time we speak 
again. 

The Forerunner — a spaceship? 
Arriving on Earth? It was what I 
had hoped, but I had hoped wijdly. 



unscientifically. A spaceship froni 
where? A spaceship whose crew 
spoke English? Fantastic! All at 
once I doubted that I had heard 
anything on the R&D equipment 
— the madman in the mirror had 
made it up after nearly a year at 
Tug Hill. It was obviously an oc- 
cupational hazard, a ilelirium, a 
fermented fruit of loneliness, a 
wilderness-bred hallucination. 

T hey didn’t often call me on 
the microwave from- R&D. 
Mostly when they did it was to say 
I had a letter, usually from Mom, 
and I’d tell them it could wait till 
the end of the month — or that the 
NSF wanted a report and I was to 
put some stuff together for pickup. 

This time they had a news item 
I wasn’t going to hear on the com- 
mercial broadcasts for some time. 
The R&D director told me contact 
had been made with a nonterrestri- 
al space vehicle that was approach.- 
ing Earth. They were most excited 
about a theory that the ship was 
homing on my signals from Tug 
Hill. Their information was frus- 
tratingly vague and technical. The 
alien ship was in the such-and- 
such quadrant, traveling at such- 
and-such speed, which presumably 
would bring it to Earth, unless its 
course deviated, in so many days. 
Next Tuesday, in translation. 

“How do you know all this? I 
asked. 

“They told us.’’ 

“How? Mathematically?” 



66 



IF 




“No; that’s the funny thing. In 
clear speech.” 

“Speech?” I asked, innocent. 

“English. Don’t ask me why. Ex- 
cuse me — Washington’s on the 
phone. Jerry can fill you in on the 
rest.” 

Jerry came on. 

“How about that, Walter-baby, 
you talker to the stars?” 

“How big is the ship? How many 
are aboard? What are they like?” 

“Unknown. But they do say 
they come in peace, on a mission 
of exploration.” 

“That’s nice,” I said. “It’d he 
hell if they were unfriendly. I’d 
hate to see us invaded.” 

“Don’t be flippant. Aren-’t you 
aware of the importance of this 
moment in which you share?*The 
historicity?” 

“Congratulations,” I said. “I’m 
proud to be in 4n.it. Is there any- 
thing you want me to do?” 

Jerry said that until further no- 
tice I was to carry on as usual but 
that 1 should report any deviations 
from the norm. 

That was the way he put it and 
that’s the way I’m carrying out his 
orders. The messages from my 
space girl had become my norm 
and technically I wasn’t obligated 
to tell R&D that my interplanetary 
lady friend and I had established a 
prior rapport. After all, the rights 
of the individual transcend those of 
the state. Or so I’ve always as- 
sumed in my humanistic way. 

You can imagine with what ea- 



gerness I looked forward to my 
next message from Stacy. She 
didn’t fail me. Promptly at our 
complicated rendezvous time I 
heard her voice. 

It was no hallucination. She 
spoke in English, with intelligence, 
humor, eagerness. But she did skip 
around, not really answering my 
questions or answering <those I 
hadn’t yet thought to ask. She also 
told me a story. 

One reason I’m aboard is 
that yours is largely a water 
world and I’ve made a study 
of the creatures that inhabit 
the depths. There’s another 
reason but my vanity pre- 
vents me mentioning it. I 
was lonely as a child and 
some of my most satisfactory 
relationships were.with such 
creatures. I had a boat then 
in which I went out to sum- 
mon them from the depths. 
They rose and stuck their 
snouts above the surface 4nd 
I talked to them. They did 
tricks for me. They surfaced 
and dived, surfaced and 
came to be tickled on their 
undersides. Once a group of 
them, after playing in this 
way, stood their tails in the 
air and dived deep. They 
came back with a friend they 
introduced with proud ca- 
vortings. Their friend was a 
big flat fellow, dull-white 
and eyeless. He repelled me 



IF A MAN ANSWERS 



67 




at first. But he wanted to be 
tickled too. When I put aside 
my repugnance and obliged 
him he swam in furious cir- 
cles around the boat, then 
paused close by to be tickled 
again. 1 had the feeling that 
he was thanking me. It was 
as if, lacking eyes, he were 
expressing himself to me in 
another way I could not yet 
understand. My fear of him 
gone, I leaned far over the 
side toward him and fell out, 
swamping the boat. I was a 
good swimmer but far from 
shore. The boat sank as I 
tried to right it. The sea crea- 
ture circled me, unseeing but 
aware of my position. I swam 
determinedly but the shore 
seemed no closer. He came 
up under me so that I was 
able to sit upright on his 
broad back and cling to a 
bony protuberance above 
his snout. I hung on and he 
took me to shore in zigzags, 
as if to prolong his role of 
savior. I sensed his enjoy- 
ment, which increased when 
I said,*Thank you.” He un- 
derstood me. In later days I 
came to understand him. We 
took many sea rides and be- 
came friends. - 

Fm glad I had more time 
to talk today, Walter. I’ve 
been thinkiiig about how we 
should meet. Will you meet 
me, Walter? 



I assured her, when it was my 
turn to speak, that I would. Then 
I told her what I’d learned from 
the R&D people and confessed my 
guilt at not having let them know 
earlier what I had known. I mean, 
iconoclasm should go only so far. 

Still, to have told them would 
have been to have risked their 
laughter. What could I have said 
at that point? And if I had spoken 
they’d probably have yank^ me 
out of here for skeptical confer- 
ences and sent in a hard-headed 
team of technicians. Then who 
would have talked to Stacy? 

Stacy couldn’t be bothered with 
my crisis of conscience. Her cap- 
tain was talking to them, she said 
— it was all being handled at the 
proper level, officially. Besides, 
Stacy had a plan for us at the un- 
official level. 

This is what I’ll do, Wal- 
ter. I’ll come to you from out 
of the sea. The inland sea in 
which we are to end our jour- 
ney. You probably know 
they’ve radioed us informa- 
tion from which we drew 
maps. The place is called 
Lake Ontario. Isn’t that 
nice? I’ll come to you from 
there. I’ll be your lady of the 
lakh. Now listen. Do you 
have a map like ours? Do you 
see the places called Water- 
town in your country and 
Kingston in Canada? Almost 
where lines drawn south

IF 




from Kingston and west from 
Watertown meet in the Lake 
there’s an island called Gal- 
loo .. 

Stacy seemed to have lots of 
time. She went over the plans 
twice. 

Finally she answered some of my 
questions. For the first time she 
told me the name of her people, 
although rd heard it before from 
her grandmother. They were Vem- 
bans, from the land called Vemba. 
She was vague about where it was, 
in my terms, but she knew its his- 
tory, including its generations-old 
tradition of exploratory, voyages to 
Vembalike planets. 

{ The explorer teams had failed 
again and again to discover planets 
inhabitable by beings like them- 
selves but had extended the range 
of their space voyages until one 
day they found Earth. 

But it was an Earth barely 
evolved beyond the sea stage. 
Nothing had yet crawled ashore 
to the still-smoking land. Never- 
theless the Vembans studied the 
new land and when they returned 
home they took with them some of 
the sea creatures. 

By the time of a later voyage to 
Earth there were inhabitants on its 
land masses. Again they returned 
to Vemba with specimens which 
were not yet man but which gave 
promise. 

' The third voyage to Earth was a 
cause for rejoicing. The specimens 



it yielded were a pair of brutish 
humanoids who had begun to use 
tools. 

The fourth voyage was the first 
to be recorded by Earth’s histori- 
ans — in tablets of clay. The people : 
the Vembans found had advanced 
spectacularly. They had built cities 
and mastered the rudiments of 
astronomy and their rulers were 
preserved in huge pyramidal 
tombs. Two of the people of this 
era voluntarily returned with the 
explorers to Vemba. But the Vem- 
bans also took the clay' tablets, so 
Earth’s record of their visit was 
lost. 

The Vembans’ voyages became 
more frequent as their technology 
advanced and on successive trips 
they returned with Greeks, Ro- 
mans and Elizabethan English- 
men. 

Their latest expeditioh was to 
bring them in contact with the nu- 
clear North Americas, including 
R&D and me, Walter Hurd, 
A.B.D. 

It’s a pity grandmother 
was never able to go. She was 
the, descendant of a space 
captain and the mother of 
one but it was her misfortune 
that she lived her entire life 
between voyages. She died 
before her son left on his. So 
she found what satisfaction 
she could in speaking to the 
stars. It’s a shame she never 
heard you reply. But her son

did and so did I. So she has 
been an important part of it 
— if she could only know. 

Stacy told me her people were 
returning to Earth a little ahead of 
schedule because for some time 
they’d been getting our signals — 
but they weren’t the signals from 
R&D or anybody like it. They 
were the lights of Earth’s cities, 
which had been sending tadt sig- 
nals since the Mazda revolution. 

As a matter of fact, Stacy said, 
her people were piqued and irri- 
tated by the math messages they 
had received when they were on 
thdr way (the messages hadn’t 
reached Vemba itself; our aim was 
off, apparently). The Vembans’ ir- 
ritation was with the fact that the 
messages stayed mathematical in- 
stead of becoming human speech 
or human thought patterns. It 
wasn’t until my unofficial ' mes- 
sages reached them that they be-' 
gan to get enthusiastic. 

We all like you, Walter. 
A little imagination is appre- 
dated. 

E vents moved fast then — at 
least for me, whose life had 
been a limbo of arrested movement 
in the desolation of Tug Hill. 

Sometimes I had to laugh at the 
pomposity of the arrangements my 
fellow Earthmen were making for 
the arrival of the Vembans. To un- 
official me, with my prior, person- 



al knowledge, it was.as if the alien 
ship were no more unexpected than 
an ocean liner preparing to dock as 
it had a dozen times before, while 
the rest of the Earthmen were as 
nervous and awestruck as the Wat- 
ling Islanders must have been who 
first saw the sails of the Pinta rise . 
over the eastern horizon. 

/ have the (^vantage over you. 
You with your mathematical 
minds are preparing logistically for 
the great event while I have only 
my romantic soul to put in order. 
You have no personal stake in this 
adventure and this blunts your per- 
ception. I have Stacy. 

Stacy, Stacy! 

Every time I thought her name 
a wave of weakness swept over me. 
How would I greet her? What 
would I say? Would words be 
needed? It was as if I had always 
known her and that it would be 
necessary only for me to enfold her 
in my arms. 

And then we would kiss in a ten- 
der, wondering way and look deep 
into each other’s eyes and smile 
with sudden shyness and step 
apart. But we’d ^ holding hands 
.still and would wander off along 
the beach. And our talk, whatever 
it was, would be natural and un- 
formed, as with old friends or new 
lovers. 

I had to rouse myself then and 
prepare for the next transmission. 
Regulation-bound R&D was still 
sending 2+2:4 because no one 
had amended the instructions. 



70 



IF 




When my turn came I sent a 
little something from the Portu- 
guese, Browning version: 

How do I love thee? Let me 
count the ways . 

I don’t know how I got through 
the days that followed. Soon after 
the official contact Stacy told me 
it would be wiser if we didn’t speak 
to each other again until we met. 
But how was that meeting to take 
place? I had no idea and this soon 
became apparent to Stacy. My 
mind had been too dulled by a year 
at Tug Hill to think in terms of ac- 
tion and Stacy, one of a company 
of adventurers, had to do the plan- 
ning. She had told me where she 
would meet me. An island called 
Galloo. All I had to do was be 
there. In her last message from the 
Forerunner she told me when. My 
final words to her were my promise 
to be there. She signed off satis- 
fied. 

I wish I had as much faith in my 
ability to make the arrangements 
as she had. I was good at digging 
quotes out of books — how good 
was I going to be at planning a ren- 
dezvous at a place I’d never heard 
of and persuading the infernally 
busy people at R&D to let me keep 
it without telling them why? 

Fortunately I still had my offi- 
cial transmissions to look after. 
The. routine continued and took up 
time. 

When I asked Jerry if I could 
stop he replied, “You don’t think 
they’re the only intelligent life out 



there, do you? This contact in- 
creases our chances of others on an 
exponential basis — ’’ 

He also told me where the aliens 
would come down. 

RRANGEMENTS for the 
splashdown in Lake Ontario 
were made by the Can-Am Ad Hoc 
Committee — it had some such 
name, as I had come to expect 
from minds too long pent in gov- 
ernment or on campuses. I allowed 
myself a little fantasy. I imagined 
members of Ad Hoc’s reception 
subcommittee rowing out in a din- 
ghy filled to the gunwales with 
tape recorders and litmus paper 
and box cameras and trade goods. 
And maybe a shotgun loaded with 
rock salt lest the aliens prove un- 
friendly. 

In romantic rebellion I ap- 
pointed myself to my own limited 
membership group, Tho Commit- 
tee of One to Greet Stacy. Maybe 
I’d take along ^ volume of Keats. 

' But there must have been a lot 
of serious advance planning, per- 
haps years of it on the Vembans’ 
part, because the splashdown took 
place efficiently and safely at the 
eastern end of Lake Ontario. The 
commander of the alien craft had 
been easily persuaded that the 
sheltered waters would be prefer- 
able to the chancy waves of the 
North Atlantic. Ottawa and Wash- 
ington agreed to designate the site 
as international waters piro tern. 

The Forerunner splashed down 




IF A MAN ANSWERS 



71 




at about 2 A.M. on the third of 
August. The hour and the fact that 
a summer storm had sprung up 
kept anyone from seeing it except 
the American-Canadian crews who 
had been alerted to expect it. Hav- 
ing come to rest, the huge ship 
rode high in the choppy waters. I 
heard about it on R&D’s private 
radio. But no one had come out 
yet. 

They brought in a replacement 
and heliocoptered me northwest 
out of Tug Hill. I don’t know why 
they agreed to my unexplained de- 
mand. A reward for my stellar ser- 
vices, maybe — or because of my 
implied threat to quit at ^his cru- 
cial stage when they had so many 
more important things on their 
minds. 

The helicopter pilot, a young fel- 
low who’d been raised in the North 
Country, chattered away as we flew 
over the scrubland toward the 
Lake shimmering in the sun. 

‘That’s Frederick Corners down 
there,” he said. “Worth Center’s 
just along that road. Lorraine’s up 
ahead. There’s Route Eighty-one 
— lot of traffic today. Henderson 
Harbor’s off to your right now and 
we’re coming up fast on the Lake. 
That’s Stony Island ahead. Next 
stop Galloo.” 

“Not Galloo Island,” Ltold him. 

“Galloo, Jr., then. There’s no 
name for that little hunk of rock. 
You sure it’s big enough for this 
bird?” 

“That’s what they told me.” 



R&D had told me nothing of the 
sort. It was Stacy who had picked 
it. Galloo itself was a place of 
sheepherders and coyotes. 

Galloo, Jr., had no name before 
my pilot gave it one. It lies just 
east of the dotted line on the map 
that cuts through Lake Ontario to 
let the fish know whether they’re 
Canadian or American. It was an 
ideal place for my rendezvous— it 
was far enough away from Galloo 
for privacy and yet it was the only 
other land in the area. 

The pilot repeated his instruc- 
tions about when to return — ap- 
parently he was under orders not 
to ask questions and I volunteered 
nothing — and left me there. It was 
a pleasant enough place to wait— 
about as big as a ballfield, with a 
clump of stunted trees growing out 
of a small knoll at the east end that 
sheltered me from the bright morn- 
ing sun. I had a good view of the 
oceanlike waters to the west. A 
few pleasure boats were out, far 
away. I saw nothing else in that 
direction. I wandered down to the 
western shore — it had a flat, rocky 
bottom, a shelf that ran out under 
the clear water as far as 1 could 
see. 

It was good to be outdoors, vir- 
tually surrounded by water, after 
my months in the scrubland of 
Tug Hill. There was a light breeze. 
I savored the fresh, wet air in deep 
breaths as I made a quick circuit 
of the island, then went back to the 
knoll to wait in the shade. I had

sat with my back against the high- 
est tree and despite my excite, ment 
I had dozed. 1 woke out of a gray 
dream. 

The brightness of the sky and 
water failed to dispel the brief 
hightma^ in which not Stacy but a 
great dark fish had come to me out 
of the sea. 

The word to me back in Tug 
Hill that the Forerunner was to 
make a splashdown instead of a 
landing had revived an old un- 
spoken dread. What if Stacy were 
not human? I didn’t care about the 
rest of them — they could be mol- 
lusks or eels or great crabs and 
probably R&D would be just as 
happy. But Stacy would have to be 
human and my kind of human. 
Nothing halfway, either — I 

couldn’t accept a mermaid. 

But what if she were a fish? No 
one had seen the aliens yet — still 
inside the Forerunner, they might 
be anything. 

Stacy had talked to fish — she 
had told me so. Might she not also 
be a fish? 

Clouds came out of the west and 
covered the sun. The sky turned 
gray, like my dream. The breeze 
strengthened to a wind. It began 
to rain. 

The stunted trees offered little 
shelter. I pulled up the collar of my 
lighyacket and waited. 

Something was moving on the 
water to the west. I could barely 
see through the gloom. The plea- 
sure craft had gone out of sight 



and what was coming didn’t look 
like any of them.' It moved slug- 
gishly, a black thing of ugly shape. 

If there had been anywhere to go 
I’d have run from it. It came on, 
straight toward my island; slowly. 
It couldn’t be a boat — it was too 
wide. But it could be a Vemban 
boat. 

Of course. 

But as it came closer I could see 
that it was no boat. It was a sea 
creature unknown on Earth. 

The rain passed to the east. The 
sun came out and the sudden 
brightness left no room for doubt. 
It was a dark gray monster from 
some alien sea, keeping its rendez- 
vous with Walter Hurd, talker to 
the stars, dreamer, romantic idiot. 

It came closer. Heartsick, I 
turned away and looked back to 
the mainland- where my year of 
isolation had conjured up a golden- 
haired space girl of terrestrial per- 
fection. Back there was Tug Hill, 
graveyard of so many dreams. 

“Walt—” 

A human voice was calling. 

Well, that only made it worse. 
We’d spoken in human English 
and now we’d have to again. This 
black fish spoke my language. I’d 
have to reply with cross-cultural 
courtesy, diplomatically masking 
my feelings as the historicity of the 
occasion demanded. 

I turned back to the sea. 

The black monster was in the 
shallows. But now I could see on 
its back what had been hidden by

the distance, the dimness and the 
angle of its head-on approach; It 
was flat in the water now and on 
its back was a slender golden- 
haired girl of terrestrial perfection.* 
*'Walt!” she called again. 
“Stacy—” 

I splashed out to meet my lady 
of the lake. 

H er. sea friend circled offshore 
while we talked. Once when a 
light plane flew over he dived out 
of sight. He wasn’t so bad after I’d 
been introduced to him. Black and 
ugly he was — but winsome. Stacy 
liked him. She had called him out 
of the depths and he had taxied 
her ashore. That was enough for 
me. 

Stacy and I talked for hours, 
sitting on the knoll, strolling the; 
perimeter of Galloo, Jr., wading 
out to tickle her friend on his un- 
derside. 

But as the sun began to move 
toward the west Stacy warned me 
of what would happen soon. 

As the sun Went down Stacy’s 
radiant hair began to dull. Her 
glowing skin, once golden, faded. 
I thought I’d be prepared for it, 
that it wouldn’t bother me. 

It was not just that she became 
pale. In a shocking transformation 
she turned sallow, then waxen, 
then blue-gray. I tried to hide my 
reaction but she wasn’t fooled. 

“It bothers all of us,” Stacy 
said, “so I can understand its ef- 
fect on you.!’ 



I protested that it didn’t matter 
a Int, that she was my beautiful star 
girl from the world of a blue sun, 
but it was clear to both of us that 
my words were false. 

“Even we refuse to accept it,” 
she said. “Nobody is content to be 
warm for part of the day and to 
shiver, blue with cold, the rest of 
the time. Just as we wear clothing 
for warmth and heat our houses, 
we use artificial color to hide our 
pallor. Like this.” 

From a tiny pouch she shook 
out a yellow cloak and swirled it 
around her. It hid her body but 
accentuated the absence of -color 
in her face and hair. 

She had become fretful as her 
color drained. 

“I’m really ugly, you see,” Stacy 
said, and drew up a cowl that 
masked her further. 

“Oh, no.” I put out a -hand to 
reassure her. She shrank from it. 
“No,” I said. “You’re beautiful.” 
But I said it from memory and 
that must have been my tone. 

“Indoors it’s simpler,” she said, 
speaking from deep within her 
cowl. “We have light that equals 
the effect of the sun. But we can’t 
be lit up all the time. There must 
be some darkness.” 

“People don’t see in the dark. 
The values are different then.” 
“The spectrum is different 
^here,” Stacy said. “I could never 
be out with you in the early morn- 
ing or the late afternoon! i’d be a 
fright. You’ll have to give me up

and find a girl who doesn’t turn 
into a death’s-head when the sun 
goes down.” 

Damn it, she wasn’t giving me 
time to adjust. I was sure the prob- 
lem could be lived with, overcome, 
forgotten. But she was distraught 
— nothing I said now counteracted 
the overtones of my first reaction. 
We walked along the sun-deprived 
shore, desolate. 

I protested that I’d known many 
girls but that none had appealed to 
me in any permanent way. I said 
there were special qualifies I’d 
sought but had never found until I 
heard her voice. A quality of mind 
that had made ail the difference. 
A mind that matched mine.' ' 

But Stacy was intractable. 

“Don’t tell me you respect me 
for my mind. I can’t believe you’d 
love an intellectual hag. If you 
were that strange I wouldn’t want 
you. I have enough ego to want to 
be wanted for my face and my 
body — maybe even more than for 
my mind. I’m a woman and women 
feel more than they think.” 

She was talking too much. 

“I’m a man,” I said, “but I also 
feel.” 

I drew her toward me and held 
her in my arms. She stiffened, re- 
sisting for a moment, then relaxed. 
Her cowl fell back. 1 looked into 



her eyes, which were clear white 
and deep black, and saw no other 
part of her. She was soft in my 
^rms but her eyes were wary as 
they looked into mine. 

I told her, “It’s a custom of 
Earth to close your eyes when 
you’re kiss^.” 

She closed them. I closed mine 
and kissed her. 

The universe exploded. Comets 
flashed. Stars pinwheeled. The 
moon of lovers beamed. 

I didn’t care if Stacy were gray 
or green. In our kiss she was re^ 
as fire, golden as the sun, white-hot 
with promised passion. 

I opened my eyes. There was 
color in her face. 

“You’re a peach!” I said. 

“What?” She looked at me, puz- 
zled. Her eyes were no longer black 
and white — they were blue with 
specks of gold. And her skin . 

“The color of a peach,” I said. 
“Close your eyes.” 

I kissed her. again, for a long 
time, then looked. She was glow- 
ing — face, hair, throat. Who 
needed the noontime sun? We had 
our own source of energy, our own 
box of colors.

to supplement the kisses with sun- 
lamps and Vitamin D. These may 
be useful adjuncts. But I prefer the 
inner fires that were lit in the lone- 
ly time of our journeying toward 
each other and which have upset 
her Vemban-based spectrum. 
There had never been such a ro- 
mance as ours. She continued to 
glow as I admired her., 

I think we knew then, with the 
sun low over the lake and the R & 
D helicopter beating toward us 
from the mainland, that we’d find 
the ways to work it out. We kissed 
again and her glow lasted until 
long after we were airborne. 

There’s probably a scientific ex- 
planation but science is not my 
field. As an English major I prefer 
the poetic. Shakespeare said: For 
now my love is thaw’d: which, like 
a waxen image ’gainst a fire, bears 
no impression of the thing it was. 

You know the rest. The captain 
of the Vemban craft, Stacy’s fath- 
er, offered to modify a multi-na- 
tion space vehicle for stardrive. 
Their ship and Earth’s will make 
the journey to Vemba with mixed 
crews. It may take a year. Some 
Vembans will remain here to con- 
tinue their studies of an Earth on 
the eve of the twenty-first century. 

They have a lot to catch up on. 
The Vembans hadn’t journeyed to 
this planet since' the time of Shake- 
speare. Neither he nor 'any other 
^rthman recorded the visit then 
but one of his patrons might have 



heard rumors of it. Didn’t Queen 
Elizabeth say in 1580 (she was ad- 
dressing the Spanish ambassador): 
“The use of the sea and air is com- 
mon to all; neither can a title to the 
ocean belong ta any people or pri-v 
vate persons, forasmuch as neither 
nature nor public use and custom 
permit any possession thereof.’’ 

She might have been talking 
about space. 

There’s a long list of volunteers 
who want to make the trip to Vem- 
ba next year. I’m high on that list. 
The Vemban captain, son of the 
woman whose voice I was the first 
Earthman to hear, has insist^ that 
I have priority. Furthermore, as 
his future son-in-law. I’ve been 
forgiven for witholding informa- 
tion about his mother’s voice con- 
tact with R&D’s Tug Hill station. 

The Guggenheim people are 
willing to wait until a calmer time 
for me to finish my work on Steph- 
en Crane's-lost nianuscripts. The 
vice president for academic affairs 
has extended my leave of absence 
indefinitely. 

NASA has asked me to write a 
report. Life Magazine is outbid- 
ding Look for a first-person ac- 
count. The university wants my 
papers. 

Anything else? Yes. After the 
wedding Stacy and I are going to 
take a year’s lease on that farm- 
house on the western slope of Tug 
Hill. I may never write another 
word; •

1 HAD just left the Computer 
Center when I ran into old Ash- 
by in the hall. His face was sheet- 
white as he l^ned against the wall. 
Ashby is one of the senior people 
in chemistry. I thought he might 
be having a heart attack. 

“Anything wrong?” 

Ashby looked at me silently, his 
eyes clouded with pain. He spoke 
with obvious effort. 

“Do you remember the name of 
that six-foot rabbit in the old 
play?” 

“Do you mean Harvey? He was 
an invisible rabbit.” 

‘‘Well this one’s six feet long 
and visible,” said Ashby. “I saw 
him in Duckworth’s lab.” 

As unobtrusively as I could I 
sniffed the air between us but 
could detect no scent of booze. 
Senility, of course, is odorless. 
Nevertheless, my curiousity was 
piqued and I made straightway 
for the chemistry building and 
Duckworth’s lab. His door was 
locked but a dim glow seeped 
over the transom. I hesitated for a 
moment and then knocked. No 
answer. I knocked again and a 
shuffle of steps approached the 
door. It opened and Duckworth 
peered out, clearly annoyed. But 
his face cleared when he saw me 
and he waved at me in a friendly 
manner. 

“Come in,” he said, “and be 
quiet. I’m in the middle of some- 
thing.” 

I followed on tiptoe, drawing 



on experience gained in the fourth 
year of kindergarten many years 
back. I had been in these hal- 
lowed surroundings before but I 
had never lost the sense of rev- 
erence at seeing Duckworth’s 
complex maze of apparatus. The 
small room held a mass spectrom- 
eter, a countercurrent apparatus 
of many glass curves and Iwnds — 
beyond^ these, Duckworth was 
gazing into microscope stand. I 
took a seat nearby and sat quiet- 
ly. After a while Duckworth en- 
tered some penciled notes into a 
stained gray binder, sighed con- 
tentedly and turned to me. 

“I suppose you’ve run into that 
idiot, Ashby,” he said. 

I was startled at his reading of 
my thoughts. I coughed in embar- 
rassment. 

“I did see him in the corridor 
< outside the Copiputer room.” 
“He’s an ass,” said Duckworth. 
“1 showed him an amazing thing, 
a bead and wire model of a new 
complex molecule I’ve developed 
after years'of work. It is the basis 
for growing an entire living or- 
ganism. Ashby stared at it for a 
while and then he said, ‘Some- 
body’s going to poke their eyes 
out on that wire.’ ” 

I smiled. 

“He mentioned something 
about a six-foot rabbit.“ 

Duckworth frowned. 

“Emma?” he said. “I suppose 
the secret’s out. Come along and 
I’ll show her to'you.”

IF 




He led me through a side cor- 
ridor into his Animal Room. He 
opened the door in a gingerly 
manner, fumbling for the light 
switch, flicked it on. I almost 
leaped but of my skin. There, 
working its whiskers amiably^ was 
the biggest rabbit I’d ever seen. 

“What do you think^ of her?’’ 
said Duckworth. 

“She’s big.’’ 

“A slight miscalculation on my 
part,’’ said Duckworth. “But look 
at those gorgeous blue eyes and 
the snow white fur.’’ 

“She is a beauty,’’ I admitted, 
“if you can get past her size.’’ 

“Don’t get hung up on her 
length,’’ said Duckworth. “The im- 
portant thing is — I made her.’’ 

The room reeled about me. I 
steadied myself on what I thought 
was Duckworth’s shoulder until I 
realized I was holding on to the 
rabbit. I recoiled as if from an 
adder. 

“What do you mean, made 
her?’’ 

Duckworth sighed. 

“Ashby reacted the Mme way,’’ 
he said. “I told you I had a new 
complex molecule from which I 
could grow a living organism. It 
was the logical next step from my 
macromolecule, which was so like 
the RNA-DNA complexes. I de- 
cided to work out a way of for- 
mulating my own genetic coding 
and create something according 
to blueprint.’’ 

“The rabbit was your first try?’’ 



“Emma was my fifth,’’ said 
Duckworth. “But she’s the first to 
develop into a viable creature.’’ 
“Do you know what you’ve 
done?’’ I cried. “You’ve cracked 
the greatest secret of the Ages. 
Why haven’t you announced it?’’ 
“Too many ramifications,’’ said 
Duckworth. “Besides, I’ve got one 
Nobel Prize in chemistry. I don’t 
think I could get another.’’ 



I PULLED out my handkerchief 
and wiped my brow but the 
sweat popped out afresh. 

“My God,’’ I said. “Wait until 
the ecclesiastical types hear what 
you’ve done.’’ 

“That’s why I’ve kept it quiet.’’ 

A sudden thought struck me. I 
hesitated to voice it. 

“Is it now possible,’’ I ventured 
tentatively, “to create some kind 
of human creature?’’ 

Duckworth stroked his beard 
calmly. 

“Odd that you should ask 
that,’’ he said. “The preparation I 
was examining when you came in 
is just that.’’ 

I shook my head violently. 
“You’ve gone much too far,’’ I 
said. 

“Do you really think so?’’ said 
Duckworth. “It’s at a very early 
and tricky stage of development 
right now. There are cells in the 
process of dividing. At the mo- 
ment, they are in the blastocyst 
stage. I’ve got to supply a pseudo

uterus for anchoring. It will be a 
couple of months before it will 
look human.” 

“What color will the baby be?” 
I said. 

Duckworth shrugged. 

“I didn’t give a thought to col- 
or,” he said. “But it will eventu- 
ally be a white female.” 

“Ah ha,” I said. “You didn’t 
think about color but you chose 
white. That will open you to the 
charge of racism.” 

Duckworth’s eyes widened. 

“I suppose you’re right,” he 
said pensively. “Most of the world 
is nonwhite. I probably should 
have made her black.” 

“Then you’d have been accused 
of exploitation, of appeasing the 
ghettos or just not giving a 
damn.” 

“You can’t win, can you?” 

“Stop the embryo from devel- 
oping any further. Then present 
Emma to the world. The rabbit 
should be enough for starters.” 
“You mean kill my embryo? I 
couldn’t do that,” said Duck- 
worth. “It’s alive.” 

I righed: 

“Good God, Duckworth. Peo- 
ple have had abortions before. 
There are circumstances which 
make it perfectly proper.” 

“Not to me,” said Duckworth. 
And his jaw set in a manner I’d 
seen before. It was clear that fur- 
ther argument was futile. We both 
sat silently' brooding over what 
had taken place, until Duck- 



worth’s innate optimism won. 

“It will all work out,” he said. 
“Wait and see.” 

“What about President Hinkle? 
Does he know what you’ve done?” 

“No one knows but Ashby and 
you,” said Duckworth. “I under- 
estimated Ashby’s loquacity and 
your strong ethical code.” 

“You’d better tell Hinkle be- 
fore he gets it indirectly. And 
quickly.” 

Duckworth scratched his head. 

“I hate like hell to do it,” he 
said. “But I suppose you’re right. 
I’ll let him know today.” 

I T TOOK some convincing but 
I finally pursuaded Duckworth 
that it wouldn’t do to tie a bright 
pink ribbon about the rabbit’s 
neck and set a basket of colored 
eggs at her side. He muttered 
something about my lack of hum- 
or and went to the phone to dial 
the president’s office. I can still 
see the look on Hinkle’s face 
when he came into the lab. Right 
behind him was his secretary, 
Myrna, and I was in position to 
catch her as she fell backward. 

President Hinkle kept mutter- 
ing, “God damn — ” as Duck- 
worth patiently described what he 
had done. He also avoided look- 
ing at the rabbit, although every 
now and then he sneaked a side 
glance at her. I patted Myrna’ s 
wrists and rubbed her temples un- 
til she came to. l 

Duckworth had paused and I 

IF 



80 




assumed he was about to spring 
his piece de resistance about the 
human embryo, so I slowly 
backed out of the room and beat 
it the hell out of the chemistry 
building. I went home, turned on 
my television set and watched the 
basketball game of the week. It 
was wild, exciting, with some of 
the finest defensive play I’d ever 
seen. But I was waiting for some- 
thing else and it came. 

During overtime, a small line of 
news flashes suddenly broke at 
the bottom of the picture. The 
name of Duckworth appeared, 
“secret of life discovered — ’’ and 
a lengthy quote from President 
Hinkle. I switched off the set and 
decided to make amends for my 
cowardice and get back to the side 
of my friend. 

When I arrived at the campus 
an enormous mob was there, held 
back by the biggest array of state 
troopers I’d ever seen. For a mo- 
ment I was totally perplexed. We 
already had a black-run depart- 
ment of African Culture, two hun- 
dred black students and four 
courses in Swahili. Then I real- 
ized that the TV flashes had done 
the job. 

Despite my faculty card I could 
make no headway through the 
lines. Then I saw a guilty looking 
chap ease out from under the bar- 
ricades, gingerly balancing a 
small V I package. He was neatly 
dressed and shaven but I recog- 
nized Duckworth at once. He 



clapped his hand over my mouth 
before I could shout his name and 
we stumbled off together. When 
we had fled some distance from 
the crowd 1 pried his fingers from 
my mouth. 

“Why are we running.away?” 
“Have you got a better idea?’’ 
he snarled. “There were twenty 
television cameras turned on me 
and a deadly stream of the most 
idiotic questions. Besides, I didn’t 
want them to find out about the 
embryo.’’ 

He pointed to the package. 

“Is it in there?’’ 

Duckworth nodded. 

“Didn’t you tell Hinkle about 
her?’’ I said. ' >. 

His shoulders sagged. 

“I couldn’t,’’ said Duckworth. 
“I decided the only way to handle 
this problem was to take the em- 
bryo with me, let it develop to full 
maturity and then publish the in- 
formation in a scientific journal.’’ 
“And the rabbit?’’ 

“Hinkle will be good to her,’’ 
said Duckworth. “Some day when 
Emma is older she’ll understand 
why I had to abandon her.’’ 

“It’s a mistake, Duckworth,” I 
said. “Eating in diners, sneaking 
chemicals from the corner drug 
store, holing up in the High 
Sierras. It won’t work.” 

Duckworth chewed on his lower 
lip. 

“There is another way,” he said 
pensively. “I could have Laura 
Lockman look after the embryo at 



CHILD'S PLAY 



81 




her apartment. How about that?” 
“Laura Lockman, your grad- 
uate student? Does she know 
about the human embryo?” 

“Not officially,” said Duck- 
worth. “But I think she’s on to 
what I’ve been doing. I’m sure 
she’d help and we’d only require 
a minimum of equipment at her 
place.” 

And that’s where we went. 

L aura was delighted to help. 

From time to time she’d slip 
me a little bla<?k-and-white photo- 
graph to look at. 

“Notice,” she said, “it’s now 
about one-quarter inch long. That 
tiny tube is the heart aiid it’s 
beating strongly.” 

Five weeks later she pointed out 
the head, the beginning of finger- 
nails, the tiny, closed eyelids. The 
project was fascinating and chill- 
ing. Month by month our. human 
developed, from embryo to fetus, 
fetus to an about-to-be-born baby. 
The most difficult part, I gath- 
ered, was the special membranous 
amnion that Duckworth devised 
out of a selectively permeable 
plastic material. 

On the academic front, Duck- 
worth was constantly plagued by 
visitors, invitations to.»television 
interviews and correspondence 
from the National Institute of 
Health, asking him to gather his 
ideas and techniques into a mon- 
ograph on the creation of life. 

“It’s hopeless,” said Duck- 



worth to me, one morning. “Be- 
tween all this harassment, sneak- 
ing over to Laura’s apartment 
and maintaining my research here 
I’m exhausted. And tonight I’m 
featured speaker at the Alumni 
Dinner.” 

“I wouldn’t miss you for the 
world,” I said. “Especially since a 
contingent of Fundamentalist 
Churchwomen is promising to dis- 
rupt the proceedings.” 

Duckworth said wistfully, his 
face brightening for the first time 
in weeks, “God, I hope they do.” 

But they didn’t. The dinner 
proceeded mechahically along its 
predestined dull path. President 
Hinkle in a flowery introduction 
outlined his own career and 
capped it with his penetrating dis- 
covery of Duckworth teaching 
chemistry and coaching basket- 
ball at a small girls’ college in the 
Berkshires. 

As Duckworth arose, spreading 
his spidery fingers through the 
wrinkled notes of his speech, an 
usher came quickly down the aisle 
and pressed a note into his hand. 
He read it, turned livid beneath 
his newly restored beard and 
bolted from the dais. I clutched at 
his tuxedo as he went by. 

“Duckworth — what’s hap- 
pened.” 

“It’s Laura, I must go to her,” 
he muttered. “The baby is being 
born — ” 

President Hinkle had also 
jumped to his feet and waddled 



82 



IF 




over to me. He looked puzzled. 

“Where’s he going,” he whis- 
pered hoarsely. “He’s disrupting 
the dinner.” 

“It’s the baby,” I said without 
thinking. “He’s got to go to Laura 
Lockman at once.” 

President Hinkle stared at me, 
thunderstruck. 

“Baby?” he cried. “Duckworth, 
Laura? I can’t believe it. The 
scandal could destroy the Uni- 
versity.” 

And he fell heavily into a near- 
by seat without giving its occu- 
pant a chance to get out from un- 
der. The dinner ended in confus- 
ion— indeed, to this day there re- 
main those who insist that Duck- 
worth and Laura produced the in- 
fant through rather standard pro- 
cedures. But the academic world 
knew better. The excitement and 
adulation that followed the pub- 
licizing of Duckworth’s rabbit was 
nothing coippared to what erupted 
on the announcement that a girl 
baby had been produced by arti- 
ficial means. 

Denunciations quadrupled and 
the raging moral issues underlying 
artifical creation were debated 
across every breakfast table. 
Duckworth seemed impervious to 
all of this furor. He called nie 
aside one morning to show me 
three six-by-eight free photos that 
had come with the diaper service. 

“It’s amazing, Duckworth,” I 
said. “You’ve kept your balance 
and avoided a display of hubris. 



Why sometimes even I feel over- 
whelmed by it all.” 

“I can’t afford to be,” said 
Duckworth. “I’ve a new mouth to 
feed now. And besides, a certain 
high government official is meet- 
ing with me this afternoon. It’s 
all very hushhush but I refused to 
come unless you were present. 
After I’d ignored the reasons de- 
tailing why you can’t get a secur- 
ity clearance, they reluctantly 
agreed. Will you come?” 

“I’m flattered,” I said. “But 
what help can I offer?” 

“I have an idea of what they 
want,” said Duckworth,” and if 
I’m right I’ll need your moral 
support.” 

1 WAS apprehensive all through 
the preliminaries of the meet- 
ing. Mr. Hubbard of the Defense 
Department was surrounded by a 
half-dozen of his brightest aides. 
On our side were President Hin- 
kle, his secretary Myrna, Duck- 
worth and myself. Mr. Hubbard, 
in glowing terms, began to outline 
a vast grant program involving 
millions for the University, with 
Duckworth heading a new Chem- 
ical Life Research Building. 
Duckworth looked at me, eye- 
brows raised. I shrugged. 

“What do you get in retup?” 
Mr. Hubbard smiled. 

“Not me,” he said. “Uncle 
Sam. He’s wise enough not to tell 
Emmett Duckworth what to do. 
But we do have one little specific 



CHILD'S PLAY 



83 




project in mind..” He paused, shuf- 
fled his papers, cleared his throat 
and went on. “Dr. Duckworth, 
the government would like you to 
produce a test run of fifty male 
babies for us.” 

We were all thunderstruck. 

“Fifty babies?” said Duck- 
worth. “But why?” 

Mr. Hubbard looked around 
the room. 

“There are a considerable num- 
ber of us present,” he said. 
“Could this be just between you 
and me?” 

President Hinkle arose, sway- 
ing like a seal, his pride clearly 
injured. 

“I’m ready to go,” he said, his 
voice breaking. 

Hubbard’s six aides rose quick- 
ly. 

“He stays,” said Duckworth, 
pointing at me. 

Hubbard hesitated, frowned, 
then nodded. In short order the 
three of us were alone. 

“Now,” said Hubbard, “in my 
portfolio is a fully detailed scen- 
ario. I’ve been working on it since 
the announcement about your six- 
foot rabbit. I knew that eventually 
you’d have to produce a human 
child.” He glanced down at his 
papers. “It’s taken me many 
months of arduous work.” 

“No doubt,” said Duckworth 
dryly. 

“Briefly,” $aid Hubbard, “it’s 
this. For years, our nation has 
been frustrated and held back in 



its military policy by the fear of 
deaths among our military per- 
sonnel. Some observers feel that 
one of our Presidents was driven 
from office because of casualty 
lists and the resulting resistance 
to the draft. Every mother whose 
son may be sent into battle be- 
comes a potential propagandist 
against the government. But she’d 
be quite placid if she knew that 
her own sons would never have to 
go to war.” 

“Meaning?” said Duckworth. 

“If we had a group of young- 
sters without family ties, real and 
yet not real, belonging to no one 
but Uncle Sam, there would be no 
protests, sit-ins or demonstrations 
if they died in battle. It would be 
the ultimate solution of our mili- 
tary manpower problem at min- 
imal cost.” 

I sucked in my breath. Duck- 
worth looked at me and placed 
his hand on my shoulder. 

“As I understand you,” he said 
severely, “you want to use my 
methods to man an Army.” 

“Also a Navy and Air Force,” 
said Hubbard. “It should be 
child’s play for you — and no pun 
intended. You might even give us 
youngsters predesigned with par- 
ticular aptitudes for the military 
life, perhaps some XYY chromo- 
somal types with aggressive tend- 
encies?” 

Duckworth stood up and I 
joined him. 

“The answer is no,” he said. 

IF

“Forget the idea. I’ll never coop- ' 
erate with you.” 

“Bravo, Duckworth,” I mur- 
mured. 

Hubbard ignored me. He 
looked at Duckworth and sighed. 

“I was afraid you might react 
this way,” he said. “I know you 
think you’re taking a moral stand 
but you’re wrong. Do you want 
to condemn real youngsters to 
death?” 

“I want no youngsters to die,” 
said Duckworth. 

Hubbard gathered his papers 
together. 

“You realize,” he said, “that 
we can proceed without you. I 
took the precaution before this 
meeting of impounding your 
papers and notebooks under the 
National Security Act. Somewhere 
we’ll find competent, patriotic 
chemists who can build on your 
notes.” 

“I don’t doubt that, you’ll find 
biochemists to help you,” said 
Duckworth. “But it will take quite 
a while before you’ll get what you 
want.” 

Hubbard smiled. 

“Perhaps — we’ll see.” 

Duckworth leaned forward. 



“Could you use an entire army 
of women?” 

Hubbard frowned. 

“Why women?” 

“Because as yet. I’ve been un- 
able to produce a male,” said 
Duckworth, “a problem in syn- 
thesizing a perfect Y chromo- 
some. I haven’t the foggiest no- 
tion of how to solve it.” 

“You’re bluffing.” 

“Ask your chemists,” said 
Duckworth. “And while they 
spend ten years digging up the 
answer, maybe I can scuttle your 
plan.” 

A fter, as we walked under 
the fragrant pines that bor- 
dered the campus, I congratu- 
lated Duckworth on his stand. 

“Imagine that SOB calling my 
little girl unreal,” he said. “But 
you were right. It really is a lulu 
of a mess I’ve gotten into. But 
science doesn’t produce evil con- 
sequences, only men do.” 

And for the rest of th^ after- 
noon, Duckworth and I pooled 
our intellects and went through 
the list of four hundred girl’s 
names without finding a single 
one we could agree upon. •

The human and the alien had

I 

I T BEGINS on Merthe — and 
there, finally, it returns. But 
now, for this moment, the planet 
is nodding its flat top out toward 
the curdled milk-smear in which 
Earth — so far away — floats like a 
bit of blue-green mold. The four 
huge moons are sliding along the 
equator toward the far side of 
Merthe — taking with them the 
light and warmth of a dwarf sun 



which for past hundreds of years 
has receded slowly, inexorably, in- 
to the distant sky. Already the lu- 
minescent fur that caps the pole is 
filling the air with a ghostly blue 
that drifts down, mingling into the 
red haze. In a month, two months, 
this blue light will be all that re- 
mains. Under its strange pervasive 
quality the psychology of the peo- 
ple will begin to change, children 



87 



will emerge — and then, silently, 
the mbons will appear one by one 
on the horizon, like vast orange 
bubbles coming up out of lakes. 
Light — the red haze — ^will return. 

Though for them, for now, none 
of this matters. 

They are together on the patio, 
sitting at the hammered-silver ta- 
ble. Quiet. Light gleams in the 
copper tiles and wind wanders in 
the grass nearby, resting on leaves, 
sighing in shades. They are drink- 
ing a dark, heavy fluid from tur- 
quoise cups and sucking at fruits 
that, opened, fill the hand with 
rainbows. 

And she — she of the hair to 
match the tiles through the gentle 
red haze, the ' frail pink bones 
showing under the skin — she sits 
biting at a thumbnail and gather- 
ing the torn fruit peelings into a 
pile by her cup. Her features 
sharp, her hand on her knee. 
Opening her mouth to show the 
solid curved bands of bone where 
teeth might be. 

‘‘My Parent has sent a note.” 
The hand moves away from her 
mouth, leaving a tiny crescent of 
orange behind, on the lower rim of 
her lipless mouth. ‘‘They thought 
»» 

‘‘No, Rhillanda.” 

The answer she knew would 
come. 

Her fingers abandon the cres- 
cent to the peelings. She turns her 
face out away from the Home to- 
ward the trees. They are straight 

88 



and tall, white and slender like a 
man's arm, the round leaves borne 
on tiny branches spaced regularly 
from the ground up, going out 
from the trunk like zigzags of 
lightning. "Through swinging hair 
he catches a glimpse of the prongs 
of her ear. 

‘‘When, Jon. When, if not now?” 

‘‘Soon, Rhillanda. I’ve told you 
before. I’ve tried to explain.” For 
a moment he looks toward the 
trees himself, as though he sees 
the ship there behind them, miles 
away. “I must return with the 
others.” 

^ She utters a clicking sound, the 
sound of her bony tongue striking 
the hard palate. One of the phatic 
formulas common to her people, 
it could mean anything, almost 
anything. But here it meant: Why? 

‘‘The man called Perez-sky,-the 
one I call Captain, is not my Par- 
ent. The note will do no good,” he 
says. ‘‘My Parent is millions of 
miles away, months from here. A 
government. A state which was 
once many separate countries.” 

She is watching the trees. Or 
the sky. She puts the rest of her 
fruit on the small pile of peelings. 

‘‘Country — ” she almost whis- 
pers and he moves closer to her. 
‘‘A country is like a Home. You 
have told me things before, so 
many times.” 

‘‘And you’ve never understood 
them, never believed them. I’ve 
tried.”. The turquoise tints of her 
skin show strangely against the 



IF 




thin, red-hazed sky, making her 
for a moment seem to him unreal 
—distant, then near. They speak 
in their confusion of Basic, her own 
language, body gesture, and he 
feels in the .words their real dis- 
tance, their essential isolation,^ one 
from the other. “They are not easy 
things to understand. But I must ' 
return to ask permission of my 
people.” 

“A Man controls his own fate, 
Jon. Women and Others are the 
Duty of their Parent. A Man be- 
longs to himself, decides for him- 
self.” 

“Only here, Rhillanda.” His 
hand takes hers beside the peel- 
ings. Soft and warm like a bird’s 
breast, it fits perfectly within his 
palm. “I am my own but I have 
Duty to my Parent.” 

Their hands are brown and 
green, like separate clays that 
have come together. 

“Others can have no Duty, only 
obedience. You say you are a Man 
— my Parent is willing to purchase 
you as an Other — ” 

“But my Parent is far away. 
And to him 1 remain an Other in 
many ways.” 

“ — only Others lie,” she finishes 
and takes away her hand. She 
hides it in her lap. “Only Others 
are bound to the Parent. So a note 
was sent, an offer made, it was ig- 
nored. It is past understanding. 
Your words are as empty as 
shells.” She gestures toward the 
sky, orange nails flashing — then 



the hand drops back to its lap. Of 
a sudden she’s a beggar, crippled 
by not understanding. Quietly 
then: “Is it the price? My Parent 
will raise it. I can ask him, he’ll do 
as I wish.” 

No... 

“Then what am I to believe? 
Tell me— what?” 

. “Just what I have said. I know 
how difficult it is for you. But 
things arc different, ways are dif- 
ferent. I’ll come back. And then 
there will be time to explain, to un- 
derstand.” He reaches out and 
tout^es the: pile she has made and 
he damns their mongrel tongue, 
that holds back so much more 
than it lets pass. “Time. Believe 
that — that there will be time.” 

T hey sit together, looking out 
over the broad lands sur- 
rounding the Home. His eyes 
catch the glint of another Home 
far away on a hill, these strange 
slender trees posted around it, 
thin limbs barbed like wire. A 
bird emerges from one of the trees 
nearby, its mirrorlike wings flash- 
ing light across the patio floor. 

“Rhillanda,” he says and turns 
to find her watching him. “Soon.” 
Returning had been in his mind: 
that he would be back. But some- 
how again the words obscure the 
thought. She sees beneath them. 
“Today?” 

He nods. 

“We have to check out the ship 
before we Lift.” As well this way 



THISONE 



89 




as another. How else would he 
have said it — begun to explain the 
reason he came this one last time. 
And because he can think of noth- 
ing else he repeats himself: 
“Soon.” 

And she takes the word. Turns 
it, examines it — holding it off 
from her and looking. 

“Soon — ” Her fingers flush and 
covey in her hair. “Soon I will 
have time — you asked me to be- 
lieve in time? I will have time then 
to remember all you’ve told us. 
About your world, your people 
and their ways, the cities you speak 
of. Time to think of all the things 
you’ve told me alone — ” 

“Two years. No more.” 

“ — and soon I will be Age. Your 
refusal — ” her voice lifts, pushing 
his denial away — “has taken Hon- 
or from my Parent. His Duty is 
past and he’ll not hold for bids.” 
One hand climbs to the table and 
lies there. It is a quality of hers, he 
realizes now, that her hands are 
forever moving as though of their 
own accord — taking, bringing, 

arguing with themselves, arrang- 
ing objects or peering over the edge 
of tables. “Though there will be a 
bidder, early and high — ” 

And now her eyes go away to 
something in the distance. 

“The Markets pay well,” she 
says. “There are people who think 
beauty as important as utility and 
they’ll take a woman for that, even 
Bred. They’ll pay the Markets well; 
my Parent will have his Honor.” 



“But I will be back.” 

“You will be back.” 

“And soon.” 

Her hand lifts the silver pot. 
Dark liquid pours into h er cup. 

“The universe, Jon. The worlds. 
All that.” A gesture toward the 
bright thin sky and this red haze 
blushing in the air. “And this is us, 
the two of us.” She holds up a 
small rock of sugar, drops it into 
the steaming cup. Liquid splashes 
up against the side and runs back 
into the rest. Ripples consume 
themselves. The world is again 
dark, again indomnitable. “Hur- 
ry,” she says, “so little time.” 

The sugar is slowly dissolving. 

He stands and sunlight slides 
across his shoulders, making shad- 
ows on the ground of Merthe. 

“Those are not the words of 
your Parent,” he says. “Or of your 
people.” 

“No, they are not. Perhaps, af- 
ter all, I have learned something 
in hearing your stories.” She 
smiles. He notices the absence of 
lips, the bands of bone. “Goodbye, 
Jon.” 

“Until I come back. To you. And 
soon.” 

A turning, a going away. Her 
words come down the path behind 
him. 

“A Man controls his life, Jon. I 
can wait but where I wait is the 
Duty of others. I can do nothing 
more than has been already done.” 

Her voice clicks as his feet plod. 

Partway into the trees he stops. 



90 



IF 




If only there were a simpler thing 
to say, something to cross the 
spaces. 

Like Orpheus he looks back. 
She is standing by the table with 
her hand on the chair. Her Parent 
has come out to the patio from his 
study. He is speaking softly to her, 
reaching out to take her hand. Her 
head is down. 

Rhillanday Jon says to the trees 
around him. And again: Rhillanda 
—to the wind which follows him 
away from that still place, that 
girl — to the wind that follows him 
back to his ship, wings at his heels, 
the prince of thieves, whispering. 

A nd the ship took anger, 
took Jury, 

. took fire 
to itself, shoving 
the ground away, 

A nd Merthe was below, 
was behind, was 
calling, was gone, 

II 

S O JON’S long legs took him 
back to his Earth — the sprout- 
ing cinder, the whirling place. 

Took him. back to a waiting 
world. Back through corridors of 
formalities, to forms and paper 
and offense all stacked like con- 
crete blocks. Back to a room with 
long bare tables made like fists — 
where officials harrumphed, offi- 
cials inquired, officials demanded. 
It seemed to him they all smoked 
pipes, all snorted softly. 



Back to the months like the ta- 
bles, long — like the tables, 
clenched. To the waiting. 

Two weeks in a large blue room 
that smelled of wood and old pa- 
per. The faces behind the tables 
changing subtly with the hours. 
He sat in the center. The world 
moved around him. 

They put him in a smaller room, 
green, witir aluminum bars in the 
eye of the door and across the win- 
dows lacing the floor with outside 
light, making squares in which he 
could pace like a chesspiece. A 
bed, a sink, a table and paper. 
Anything he asked for. 

They would come and take him 
to other rooms. He would answer 
questions. They would bring him 
back here. 

— The subject will please 
identify himself. 

—Jon Butler, Citizen L-I54- 
D. Academy, ’15, anthro- 
pology. Service rating, D. 

—Linguist, late aboard 
Union ship Vesper? 

—Yes. 

— Last port? 

— Merthe. 

— Will the subject please 
speak more distinctly? 

— Merthe. 

At other times they brought 
their cameras and took only his 
image to those other rooms, where 
busy men sat for a moment, lis- 
tened, rushed oh.

Faces floated past the door, 
looked in, spoke, moved on. Foot- 
steps followed people down the 
corridors and stopped when the 
people stood still to listen. He 
asked about the room^ the bars — a 
formality. 

Heasiced, When"* 

Soon . 

O NE OF his guards, a sulky 
Negro, grinned and told him 
the whole world loved a lover. 

— Your statement is that you 
spent (rustle of papers) 
ten months on Merthe, 
and that during the last 
three of those months you 
went among the inhabi- 
tants and made yourself 
known to them, held com- 
munication with them and 
exchanged gifts. Is this 
common practice. Citizen 
Butler? 

—No, Honor. I was the first. 
They had watched our 
base, seen the ships — shut- 
tiers — drop and lift. And 
talked to Reps, of course. 
But I was the first, really. 

— It is not common practice? 
—No. 

— No? And why not. Citizen 
Butler, why not? 

— Merthe is A-unclassified. 

— Which means? 

— “No contact pending fur- 
ther study.” 

— You have just quoted from 



a book. Will you name that 
book for the Court, Citizen 
Butler? 

— “Regulations of Union Ex- 
pansion”. 

— “No contact, pending fur- 
ther study.” That applies, 
does it not, both to person- 
al and cultural contact? 

—Yes. Only what is abso- 
lutely essential is per- 
mitted. 

— Yet you told these people 
of Earth, the Union. You 
even went so far as to ex- 
change gifts, thereby in- 
troducing cultural anoma- 
lies? 

—Yes. 

— Then I must insist that this 
be set in the transcript: 
That the subject knew and 
was fully aware that he 
acted in direct opposition 
to Union regulations. 

— And I must insist that my 
assignment was to analyze 
the Merthe language, this 
being essential to further 
study. An assignment 
which, if the Court pleases, 
is extremely difficult to ac- 
complish through port- 
holes and energy fences. 
Also, there were particular 
problems with the lan- 
guage. Recorders have a 
rather limited vocabulary. 

— Another outburst such as 
that and we will be moved 
to hold you in comtempt of 



92 



IF 




Court, Citizen Butler. 
Simply answer the inquir- 
ies put to you. 

— I apologize. Honor. 

— Strike the reply. 

T he rooms to which he was 
taken for questioning grew 
smaller. He began to guess the 
passing time by the size of the- 
rooms. 

And this happened once: the 
guard’s face came to the door, 
asked. What are you doing? 

Singing. 

Sounded more like moaning. 
Thought you were sick. Never 
heard singing like that before. 

No. You haven’t. 

The face went away. The foot- 
steps went away. 

He burst into laughter. Some- 
one had just said "social in- 
tercourse” The last word 
had gotten the accent. 

The rooms w^re smaller — the 
people larger, more important. 
Time passed, a great deal of time. 
He lost sense — completely — of 
how much time had passed and 
this became an obsession for him. 
He sat remembering Merthe. 

— Merthe, then, is a slave 
world? 

— I didn’t say that. Honor. 

— Governed by anarchy? 

— There is no government. 

— There are no communities. 



no social groups? 

— The Family lives together. 
That’s the only thing. 

— But the Family sells its 
cliildren, its Others? 

— Only when they are Age 
and if no new Home has 
b««n created for them. 

— I ask the Court to consider 
that reply carefully. Who 
supervises these Homes? 

— The Parent. 

— Which is? 

— A father. Like that, any- 
how. 

— What of the mothers? Have 
they no say? 

— I don’t know. There was a 
woman in Rhillanda’s 
Home. But she always said 
Parent, singular. 

— There is, then, no agency, 
no control? 

— The Homes are self-sus- 
taining, virtually hermetic. 
There is a system of moral- 
ity, confusing to us, diffi- 
cult to talk about. Honor, 
Duty . 

— Who does the work that 
must . be done, the work 
that a government must be 
established to perform? 

— I don’t know. 

— Please speak louder. 

—I don’t know. It Is diffi- 
cult . 

— And do you know. Citizen 
Butler, why the adults iso- 
late themselves the way 
they do? And also why they 



THISONE 



93 




dissolve the social order? 

— Perhaps because they are 
afraid of what can happen 
when men live together. 

— I see. Is that what you were 
told? 

— No, a guess. It is impossi- 
ble — we can’t hope to un- 
derstand a culture as dif- 
ferent as theirs, not right 
away. They couldn’t make 
me understand, though 
they tried again and again. 
The language — 

— We have already heard 
your testimony concerning 
the language. Citizen But- 
ler. Do you know why their 
women are degraded so? 

— They’re not. They are 
lov^ and valued. You are' 
trying to sway the lady 
Honors. 

— He refuses to cooperate, 
may the Court notice. I 
submit that the subject 
tries to confuse the Court 
with these contradictory 
stories. 

Cameras lumbered in and fol-, 
lowed their cables back out. Each 
day he was brought large sacks of 
mail. Most of the letters were 
addressed simply: Jon “Butler, 
Councilhome. They were from 
ministers, mothers, public figures, 
perverts, schoolchildren, artists 
and teachers. It seemed to him 
that never before had he seen the 
sympathy and savagery of the hu- 
man heart so starkly portrayed. 



His guards were pleasant. The 
young Negro’s name was Berkell, 
and he had been born on Mars — 
in one of the religious colonies 
there, of one of the increasingly 
rare pure Negro strains. Each year 
he applied to the Academy and 
each year he was refused admis- 
sion. 

And time passed. 

— Will you identify this for 
the Court? 

— It is a gift from Rillanda. 
—A gift from the girl. And 
is . .? 

— A portrait of her, a paint- 
ing done by her Parent. It 
was taken from me. 

—•I ask the Court to accept 
this as evidence and re- 
quest that it be circulated 
among the Honors. 

— (Gasps and whispers.) 

T here was a break in the trees 
near Rhillanda’s Home, a sort 
of chamber where the only sound 
was water running down a slope 
soniewhere deep in the woods. 
There birds— like mirrors set out 
on the limbs and staring silently 
across the spaces at one another — 
filled the trees. 

One day on the patio she had 
jumped up, taken his hand and 
brought him there. He had lis- 
tened to her singing, lying on his 
back in the dry moss. Her voice, 
low and soft, combined in his 
mind forever with the sound of 



94 



IF 




the water far off among the trees. 

— Citizen Butler, you have 
told us something of the 
' girl’s language. You have 
mentioned, among other 
things, that there exists in 
the language a certain 
(ruffling papers) “gender 
confusion”. Have you any 
explanation for this? 

—No. 

— Nor for the “fuzziness of 
verbs” to which you also 
called our attention? Nor 
the elaborate, recompli- 
cated adjectives?” 

— No. 1 have only the vagu- 
est hold on the ' Merthe 
language, actually. I was 
forced to work from mem- 
ory rather than under- 
standing, hoping that per- 
ception would eventually 
show roads to conception. 

— And each — ah — Home has 
its own language? 

—Dialect, but not really 
that. And I don’t know — I ^ 
visited only one of , the 
Homes, f made my state- 
ment in full faith that it 
would turn out to be true 
from what I do know — and 
feel— about the language. 
It’s terribly complicated, a 
much more sophisticated 
structure than our own. 

— Then our picture of 
Merthe is a kind of land of 
Babel, everyone speaking 



his own language? In these 
—ah— emphatic sounds 

you mention. 

— Phatic. No, I believe it’s a 
process that occurs sponta- 
eousiy in the individual 
Home. A kind of amplifi- 
cation of interpersonal ex- 
pression. It comes of being 

. so close, of knowing one 
another so well. Certain 
grammatical connections 
and implications can be 
dropped, they’re superflu- 
ous. The phatic responses 
carry no actual meaning. 
They are more like direc- 
tion signals. They can 
mean many different 
things, according to how 
they’re used. 

— A return to the origins of 
language? 

— In a way, perhaps. The 
process certainly began as 
a simplification. But on 
Merthe the phonemes 
have reduplicated, devel- 
oped a- kind of endogeny, 
become almost an auxiliary 
language. 4t is full of nu- 
ance, extremely sophisti- 
cated. You can’t see the 
relations anymore but 
there must have been 
some at one time — deriva- 
tives, the signals which be- 
gin trains of speech- 
thought. The nuances are 
virtually impenetrable to 
the outsider.

— Vm afraid. Citizen Butler, 
that the Court hasn’t your 
training in these matters. 
This means little to us. 
Simply put, we can say 
that these queer people 
walk about grunting like 
apes and — 

—No! 

—But he could not be heard 
above the laughter. 

Once, when they were togeth- 
er in the clearing, Rhillanda had 
suddenly stopped singing and 
looked behind her. A girl was 
standing there among the trees, 
watching. He, too, looked around 
and she turned and fled away 
through the trees towatd a Home 
on the hill, a mile or so from Rhil- 
landa’sown. 

— Ah impenetrable lan- 
guage. A gender confu- 
sion. Anti-social, atavistic, 
introverted patterns. Cal- 
lous treatment of women. 
This is a rather frightening 
picture you’ve given us. 
Citizen Butler. 

— But we can’t — 

— Thank you. Citizen. If it 
please the Court I should 
now like to call to witness. 

O NE day, early in the morning, 
he was taken to another room, 
the smallest yet. The guards who 
had brought him here (Berkell 
was not among them, having at 



last been taken into the Academy) 
had been in uniform. The room 
was brown, trimmed in gold, the 
walls lined with matched massive 
volumes. The place was lit indi- 
rectly. The light, soft and suffus- 
ing, reminded him strangely of 
-the clearing near Rhillanda’s 
Home. A huge steel desk occu- 
pied most of the floor space. 
There was nothing on the desk. 
Four black robes glistened in the 
light and a set of spectacles 
flashed calmly. He had never seen 
glasses before. The man wearing 
them was the one who spoke to 
him. > 

— I’m Dr. Graybar, compara- 
tive physiology.' Did you 
know the girl’s race is her- 
maphroditic? 

— (Deep breath.) I thought 
that might be the fact. 
From what I was able to 
understand of what they 
tried to explain to me. It 
explains several tendencies 
in the language; also, per- 
haps it accounts in part 
for the Homes. 

—Perhaps so. I’ve been 
studying the picture they 
took from you and at- 
tempting to learn what 
little I can from Union Ex- 
pansion Records. Someday 
maybe they will find out 
the proper way to survey 
a new planet. Maybe.

taken down — it was.) Good 
— Citizen Butler, I believe 
.that the women of Merthe 
'are hybirds — throwbacks, 
or sports. Freemartins. 
Barren and sterile. Had 
you guessed that? 

. — No. I knew we couldn’t

Three days later they gave him 
his freedoih. 

It came as a gift, wrapped in 
cautious words. He opened it. 



took the gift, left the wrappings in 
the'room. 

He found himself outside in 
sunlight, being escorted past a 
group of staring, curious people. 
As his guards pushed a way for 
him through the crowd he caught 
sight of Berkell standing away 
from the others, smiling, his 
hand raised in a silent greeting 
and farewell. 

And Earth shrugged him off 
her shoulders — he went out from 
Earth as from a bow. 

Hurled 

upward, forward, outward 
like a rock 
and Merthe 
was calling again. 

Ill 

T O GET her back, take her 
back. It was always that. 

When he walked the bleaching 
sands of Coldor, or between the 
blushing quartz hillocks of goose- 
- flesh Albay-3— when on Farthay 
his feet kicked out jewels before 
him. Through -all the pleading 
winds of Xantharie, telling and 
crying with a hundred voices, a 
hundred hands. Under the pastel 
rains of Chyth; the acid snows 
that make the island of New 
Corfu a floating sponge; through 
the seas of Fford thick with 
weeds. Among the many-bodied 
people of Gaffrt and the sad wo- 
men of Llyrch with their exor-

cised breats and carved bellies. 

Always. 

To get her back, take her back. 

And to find her he ripped the 
stars apart, tore wide the years 
between them, screamed in the 
skull of space. 

Three years had passed. 

The stars told him so and he 
shouted back. You lie. He 
screamed at the stars: Stand still. 
He told them: I'll put out your 
eyes. 

But three years had passed. 

From her Parent’s study, where 
in the blue light a new child 
moved quietly among the patio 
furniture, he went directly to the 
Markets. She was sold the first 
day, they told him, for a fine 
price, and Llyrch was the name 
given. 

He went to Llyrch, went down 
among the Nonconformists and 
their shanty churches. Gone. And- 
for weeks he wandered, at last 
finding a minor official, a small 
man hurt further into smallness, 
who would tell him, would tell 
him simply because superiors 
wouldn’t. Goliath was what the 
man spoke. Goliath was where he 
went. 

Gone. He wandered. 

On Farthay he gathered gems 
— scarlet, emerald, gold, spilling 
from his hands — and on Plath 
gave them all for a ship, Httle car- 
ing that behind him as he left, a 
dozen ships sped toward Farthay 
with empty holds. 



It was with this small ship he 
ripped the stars apart, pushed 
down the walls between worlds. 

Off Plath he accelerated. His 
ship went like a stake into the 
black eye, the Sambo sky, immeas- 
urable space. 

He heard of a girl on Lilth, 
where men have long legs and the 
houses are built on stilts off the 
ground. A strange girl with cop- 
per hair and clicks in her speech 
—a strange girl. He went there, 
the girl was jgone. 

Was she Rhillanda? He fol- 
loyt'ed what traces he found. 

He sought her on Garth, in the 
caves of Perchmont. When at last 
he came up out of the caves, light 
struck his eyes like fists and for 
days he was blind — nearly blind — 
and fevers raged in his chest from 
the damp air of the caves. 

O N BYZANTIUM, where he 
had been before and which he 
had named, he found them sing- 
ing her songs. The girl who had 
brought the songs?*No^ they could 
not remember, there were so very 
many singers — wait! 

Alsfort. 

Could she have gone there? 

He jumped. 

No, not Alsfort, no longer. 

Nor Plethga.- 
Nor Ghlint. 

He wondered, wandered. Deep 
space opened like doors. He raged 
along the bands of night. 

Nor Mersey. 



98 



IF 




Nor Larne. 

He searched for her among the 
bodies and wasting faces of the 
people of Hikuu, where poison 
had come up out of the rocks to 
spoil the waters and this world 
was dying. For once there was joy 
in his heart at finding her gone. 

He strayed among the supersti- 
tious tribes that peopled VoFtura 
and was thought a god for his hair 
and size. Yes, Lord, there had 
been a ship at the great port many 
months ago. It had come down 
out of the black for repairs and 
flown away again into the dark- 
ness. 

He left. He followed her. And 
behind' him the tribes began to 
await his return. 

Again he lost the trail. Again, 
the thread tangled and vanished 
out among the whirling galaxies. 

Insouciance. Six weeks of it, 
brimful, sitting in a chamber of 
the hotel Grand Daphne. In los- 
ing the trail he had lost some- 
thing else as well — the strength to 
go on. He sat in his shell chair. 
Rainbow hues spilled down the 
wall. His eyes rattled hollowly, 
idly, uncaring from face to face. 

An old woman without teeth or 
clothes, an astrologer, came and 
made his chart. 

The stars are friendly to no 
man, she said, grinning to show a 
mouth full of brown and pink 
flesh, though to you less than to 
others. I see a dark star and a 
bright star, between which you 



must pass. And water, which may 
be real or emblematic. That is all. 
A dark star,^ a bright star, water. 
You must find their meaning for 
yourself— there meaning . exists' 
within you. 

And she went away. 

He sat in his chamber and it 
came to him that the bright star 
m^ant going on — the dark star, 
surrender. There, in the light- 
clustered, color-cluttered room, 
he passed between them and 
chose. And the water — space like 
an endless sea. Or many seas. He 
sailed to 0em. 

T he waterworld of Tigris — his 
small boat ferried him down 
the waters that lapped up against 
the prow, swelled under it, ran off 
in wings to either side. He drifted 
past the floating islands of thick- 
packed leaves, under the quick 
shade of lonely slick trees. He 
came to one of the fortress islands, 
arms upraised. 

He asked his questions. His 
boat wound its way back. 

And later, in the flannel seas of 
space, he found the thread 
wrapped around the world of 
Euphis, where the sky forever 
frowns and the clouds hang on the 
horizon like black fists and you 
can tell the falling rain in the 
plunge of thermometers. On 
Euphis he mixed fury" with finesse 
and clawed his way back into 
space, following the thread, spil- 
ling stars behind him;

Going on. 

HE CAME to the energy shells 
outside Darwin. He passed the 
warning shell and rockets erupted 
from the ground below and 
chased him away, darting and 
skimming into the blackness. 

HE CAME to the festival 
crowds of Mensch and for two 
hours followed a woman who at 
last turned and smiled invitingly 
and was no{ Rhillanda. 

HE CAME to Delhi and found 
nothing. Some ruin, some wreck- 
age and crablike inhabitants scut- 
tling sideways in the cluttered 
sand under a white sun. 

HE CAME to Altar, bowed and 
begged ai^d was sent away. 

HE 'CAME to the gaming 
houses that acned spoiled Vega, 
Vega the victim of another’s war, 
and a girl there told him of one 
who had been taken away to the 
magistrates at Kil-hing. Taken for 
her beauty alone, though beauty 
was a thing that could tire. 

HE CAME to Kil-hing and the 
prophets with their bears met him 
at the shipcourt and said. No, go 
on. She is not here. 

Stories came from Catmount, 
stories of slaves and a new order. 

He arrived there in the daze, 
the craze, the dazzle and whirl of 
revolution, resolution. Bands 
roamed the streets, chanting slo- 
gans at one another, poking at the 
cadaver of their city as though 
they tried to understand why, 
what had happened. Children 



wandered in the ruins, bearing 
stickguns and wearing armbands. 
Sentries challenged his passage, 
women whimpered for food, shel- 
ter, kindness. 

And the new order, they told 
him, was abolitionist — the slaves 
were sent away. 

Guns screamed and crowds 
shouted. 

But could not call him back. 

H IGHKER. He came down in 
a field beyond the burrows, 
where a duel had just been fought. 
The grass crackled under his feet 
as^ he walked across it toward the 
bodies. Behind the burrows the 
trees rippled in the wind like 
green foil. 

One body lay swollen and still 
at the toe mark. The other— the 
challenger and winner — had stag- 
gered away and lay in the folds of 
a vast cabbagelike plant. Stinger 
spent, the body was dying, twitch- 
ing regularly, the motion going 
out in slow waves along the 
plant’s leaves. 

And gasping at the doors of 
death, the twitches becoming a 
shudder that gradually mounted 
in intensity and claimed the whole 
body, this man who had kept his 
Honor intact told Jon of a new 
colony in the Upper Places. There 
were slaves there, many were wo- 
men. There was one. 

Jon ripped the stinger from its 
case of bone and plunged it into 
the man’s stopped heart, leaving

the other lying there in dishonor. 
His small ship surged 
out 

like a sea, 
out 

like a sun. 

IV 

I T WAS on bright Alabaster he 
found her at last — in the slave 
camps of the Brocks. 

The Places streamed by — a 
thousand-mile plume of white-lit 
bodies. A fall — and the Places 
were replaced by a stream of 
farms. White suns blazed at his 
head like matches freshly struck. 
He found her in Thalk. 

Months ago a hundred larvae 
the size of large dogs had scaled 
the trees and barnacled them- 
selves to high branches. There, in 
their crisp shells, they had slept 
and grown, transforming into 
near-adults that weeks later came 
down out of the trees and moved 
into the camps to take their 
places, leaving behind the bony 
shell, the Husk. Now, matured, 
they were going out again from 
the camps — to retrieve their 
Husks apd bring them back as a 
sign of completed manhood and 
to save them from the soul-prey- 
ers, the scavengers who were also 
abroad in the land now. 

He went to the offices at Thalk, 
built of five leaves from the uthru 
plant. 

You have a girl. 



We have many girls. 

So he began again. 
Youhaveagirl. 

He told them of her face, her 
hair, the fragile bones beneath 
her skin. To them he showed the 
gold which, according to custom, 
he had taken from the dying man 
on Highker. Light came through 
the small window and filled his 
hands 

It is yours, it is all I have. 

H e stood near a stream, 
watching the Thalkian come 
toward him. Its head was down as 
it pushed its way through the 
soft, needle-thin, purple grass, the 
Husk lashed to its back. |t was half 
his height, with slender bent legs 
like twigs, a ridged ovate body 
and a tiny immobile head. It 
looked up from yards away and 
saw him standing there. 

It turned to run and then 
thought better — it. had taken the 
Honors of manhood. 

“Go away, scavenger,” it said, 
blinking one of its eyelids, like the 
fingernail of a new-born child. 
“My soul will not be your prey. 
You will not have my Husk. jGo 
away. Or I shall kill you.” 

It held its club, thicker than a 
man’s leg, out in front of it. It 
crouched, preparing to fight, to 
swing and turn and keep the frail 
Husk away from the preyer. 

“No, hold your weapon. Your 
soul is not what I seek. Nor your 
Honor.”

Jon showed his palms upraised. 
Their shadows reached out and 
touched on the ground. 

“I know the trickery of the 
Thorynx.” The Thalkian drew up 
straight, taller, and looked steadily 
up at him. “Years ago the men of 
my camp kept the huth-bird. The 
huth-bird is too large to move. 
We block off its throat aiid when 
it bewitches the prey into its 
mouth children run and remove 
the prey and bring it to the 
camps, where we all eat well.” It 
pointed the club toward him. 
“The Thorynx is like this huth- 
bird. You snare men in words, 
tangle them in coils of flattery and 
illusion. Then you take what you 
want, more than you need — and 
you leave the rest to rot. You take 
our Husks, our souls, from us. You 
grow strong on them while we 
wither and die. Our camps are full 
with tales of your trickery.”- It 
shook the club. “You do not kill, 
for that would take Honor and 
you have none. Your deceptions 
are worse than honest death.” 

“No, not mine. I am not of this 
world.” 

“Another of your lies. You take 
an unfamiliar shape, turning a 
man’s desire for knowledge 
against him.” 

“ ¥AM an Earthman/’ 

•■•“Earthman.” Its eyelids flicked 
several times and the Thalkian 
looked away into the distance, try- 
ing to recall a thing it had heard. 

102 



It came to him and the eyes came 
back: “The men of Earth, they 
chase after dreams.” 

“No. A woman.” He described 
her. 

The Thalkian listened, then 
pointed with its club up along the 
stream. 

“The rath fields. If the woman 
is what you really seek you will 
find her there. The raths are ripe 
and must be picked before they 
break off the stems and turn on 
us, ruining our crops, killing our 
young on the trees.” 

He had turned to go but Thalk- 
ian spoke after him: “You are the 
only Earthman I have known. 
Good luck with your dream, what- 
ever you call it.” 

He turned back. 

“And you with yours.” 

The Thalkian stood watching, 
club alert, until he was out of 
sight. Then it crossed the stream 
and sprinted toward its camp, 
shadows rushing behind it. 

And in the white light she came 
down from the hill, slow and 
quiet as a falling leaf. The suns 
were in her eyes and her shadows 
trailed back over the hill behind 
her. She was pale, the color of 
lemons bleached by the sun. Her 
copper hair was gone. Her bare 
head was scarred and dark. She 
limped. 

And somewhere out there 
worlds were spinning, weaving 
lives and faces to a patchwork 
fabric. Children were born. Gen- 

IF 




eratibns were dying. Stars were 
exploding, suns colliding, systems 
collapsing and bursting, swelling 
and shrinking. But for now, for 
here, for them — only these two 
were moving together. 

He saw the sores along her ribs, 
like fists that had beat against 
doors until the knuckles burst and 
blood erupted. Her long nails, 
once bitten, were now torn and 
several were missing. Blood and 
dirt had spread a brown paste 
across them. There were marks 
on her fingers — tiny parallel slits 
where raths had twisted around 
on the stem and slashed to fight 
at the picking. 

And on her back, bending her 
to ,a stoop, was a shield emblaz- 
oned with the Honor-colors of her 
lover, the Thalkian who soon 
would return and ceremonially of- 
fer his Husk, binding their two 
souls together, taking her out of 
the slave fields into his camp for 
her beauty and service. 

They came together at the 
foot of the hill. He, the wanderer 
— and she. The waiter. 

“I came,” "he said. 

I screamed your name in a 
thousand worlds. I made moun- 
tains and crossed them. / ripped 
the skies apart and kicked suns 
out of my way and stepstoned on 
stars. I laughed at space, I gath- 
ered the stars in a net of need. I 
carved a hundred worlds to ydur 
likeness with my Jets. 

But he said: “I came — ” and 



the shield fell back to the hard 
rath ground. 

He took her hand and together 
through the white light they went 
over hills and along the stream — 
they trampled with boots and bare 
feet the violet grasses of Swans- 
down Plein. 

His ship slammed like a fist in- 
to the sky and together they fled 
with their scars (some that 
showed) and their freedoms (some 
that didn’t). 

B ack to Merthe. And now it’s 
evening. 

Across the pale red lake the sky 
fills with ribbons of ochre, ma- 
roon, and pearl. In a gentle wind 
the ribbons twirl and blend to- 
gether, settling into the lake, pul- 
ling night down around them. In 
the last minutes a bird emerges 
from the trees and glides along 
the corridors of wind, flashing 
color across the copper tiles. Small 
things come up on the lake’s edge 
and begin to throb softly as the 
twilight deepens to cobalt. 

Hearts and doors. Their two 
hearts had done business like 
doors and now for all time they 
shut them, closed themselves in- 
side.' Outside, Sirens beckoned. 
Furies called and went unheard. 

They are sitting together on the 
patio. She has limped to bring 
him food and sits beside him, sing- 
ing quietly over the nightsounds. 
Years have passed,' wind passing

Wiping blood from his lacerated end, an imaginary place men- 



105 



tioned by gyps when they wanted 
to frighten their young. 

“On your feet!” Hobart hauled 
him from the dirt. “So you want to 
go back to your Master? You want 
that life of ease, all of your needs 
taken care of by those damn 
Spheres who have grabbed our 
Earth?” 

Earth? What, Keith wondered, 
was that? 

“This world used to belong to 
humans. Now we have to hide in it 
like rats — unless our ancestors 
happened to be spineless enough 
to become pets — ” 

World? 

Pets? 

Hobart hustled Keith to the 
compound gate, then toppled him 
and pinned him with a foot while 
manipulating the latch. 

Keith himself was no weakling. 
His gyp, while teaching him to 
talk, had also insisted that he ex- 
ercise rather than rely on the ex- 
ertion-saring forces , of Radiant 
City. But Keith was shorter by 
half a head than his captor. And 
Keith’s beard, straight and blond, 
suggested a temperament nothing 
at all like Hobart’s fiery one. 

Oh, if only they were in the 
City of Force now, instead of this 
horrible Outride! Then he wou|d 
show his tormentor, thought Keith. 
He would make the glittering car- 
pet of energy material rise up and 
pound Hobart in the face until he 
choked on his own blood! 

Seized' once more by beard and 
mane, Keith was hurled through 
the gate. He stumbled, fell to his 
hands and knees. His head hung 
between splayed arms. 



T he lithe form of a young 
bitch, partly wrapped in ani- 
mal hides as were Hobart and 
everyone else out here, ran from 
between the two nearest shacks. 

“Must it be this way, Chris?” 
she asked the Leader. “You don’t 
want to kill him, do you?” 

“I’m determined to bring out 
the guts in him,” Hobart said. “If 
he has any.” 

Keith was jostled down the main 
pinkway — no, not pinkway; it cer- 
tainly wasn’t pink, and it couldn’t 
plane you along — the. main 
“street” of the village. 

“But it’s unfair,” the bitch 
pleaded, following. “He shouldn’t 
have been brought out of the City 
this soon.” 

Keith regarded her with scorn. 
For it was she — Laura, out of Gyp 
Bernice Tallman — ^who had es- 
caped through^ her force-mesh 
fenc^ yesterlight to free him from 
his own enclosure. That was when 
the stray pack had come yowling 
down the pinkway to capture him. 

Now, as Hobart prodded him 
through the village, Keith was 
sickened by the squalor. The 
dirt on which the village sat. Shab- 
by shacks shaped like squat cones 
and made up of slender rods 
bound at the top and smeared 
with clay. Hundreds of villagers 
who, if not actually filthy, seemed 
so in their crude animal hides. 

Keith wore nothing. Personal 
people were not allowed to. 

“I didn’t know you were going 
to be this rough on him,” Laura 
said. 

Hobart tightened his grip on 
Keith’s beard. “Well, there’s a 



106 



IF 




reason. In four days that boatload 
of lodestones and magnets is due 
downriver from ’Tucky. The 
moonshiners made tons of mag- 
nets back in the hills. When the 
boat gets here, we attack !” 

She gasped. “That soon? But 
we’ve got so many preparations to 
make!” 

Keith stumbled along, bewil- 
dered. “Lodestones? Magnets?. Atr 
tack the City? He had to find some 
way to get back and tell the Mas- 
ters about all this! 

But how could he? You couldn’t 
actually talk with Them. Oh, They 
coitld understand your general 
feelings. But you couldn’t tell 
Them even such a simple thing as: 
I’m ready to mate. Please find me 
a nice bitch. 

“Preparations, hell,” Hobart 
snorted. “Just as soon as we get 
our weapons, we’ll wipe out that 
cancer on the other side of the 
forest.” He pointed and his arm 
trembled. 

Through a gap in the trees 
Keith saw the distant proud glow 
of Radiant City, bedimming even 
the Orb of All Orbs high up in the 
Blue Dome. He could discern only 
the very tops of the magnificent 
force structures. Lofty yellow 
spires of pulsating energy. Mas- 
sive cylinders of emerald enchant- 
ment. Opalescent pyramids and ir- 
idescent ovoids that spun as they 
balanced on end, casting out 
merry showers of sparks and daz- 
zling sprays of nonsubstance. 

How he longed to return to 
Kind Master and all the other 
Spheres who took such good care 
of their personal people. 



T he Pack Leader clubbed Keith 
across the back with a forearm 
and sent him staggering ahead. 
Hobart followed, shoving him first 
in this direction, then that, until 
finally they were nearing the end 
of the village. 

“But if we attack that soon,” 
Laura protested, “we won’t have 
time to bring all the people out of 
the City. Or even find out how 
many can be humanized.” 

“That’s why everything hinges 
on this miserable creature.” Ho- 
bart planted a foot against Keith’s 
buttocks and propelled him- for- 
ward again — outside of the village, 
towards a fenced-off area en- 
closing several elongated mounds, 
each with a “stick” standing up- 
right at one end and another 
“stick” crossing the first near its 
top. 

“I don’t understand,” the bitch 
said. 

“I’ve led stray packs into the 
City for the past ten years,” Ho- 
bart explain^. “We’ve brought 
out hundreds of animalized hu- 
mans, either lured them away or 
carried them off kicking and 
screaming for their Spheres.” 
“Years” was a minor enigma to 
Keith. What confounded him most 
was this further evidence that the 
strays Outside were not only plot- 
ting evil against the Masters but 
were also stealing away Their per- 
sonal people. 

“So?” said Laura. 

“So — this creature before us is 
the most spineless, most subser- 
vient, most dehumanized animal 
we’ve run across in all of that time. 
This is the ultimate test cast. If 



O KIND MASTER 



107 




we can break him down, we’ll 
know that everybody in that City, 
and therefore in other Cities of 
Force, can be reclaimed as a hu- 
man being.” 

Keith was astonished. Why, 
only yesterlight he had imagined 
that his one Magnificent Metrop- 
olis filled all existence every- 
where. 

He stole a glance at the trailing 
bitch, then looked away in dis- 
gust. For several hot-colds he had 
been avidly aware of her pres- 
ence in his moundhood. Many 
were the times he had watched 
her, even shouted at her, as she 
exercised within the force-mesh 
enclosure behind her Master’s 
mound. And each time she had 
shouted back or waved to him, he 
had torn his fingernails trying to 
breach the crisscross energy 
strands of his fence. 

But all the while she had ap- 
parently been only a plant, a spy, 
eager to tell Hobart who should 
be captured and taken Outside 
next. Such a beautiful bitch he 
had neVer seen before. Rich 
brown hair. Eyes as dazzling blue 
as the energy material of the most 
lustrous mpund. But what treach- 
ery! What evil purpose against the 
Spheres! And he had liked her 
better when she had been prop- 
erly nude rather than covered 
with animal hides. 

L aura looked ahead at the 
area of elongated dirt mounds 
and crossed sticks. ‘‘You’re not go- 
ing to give him the graveyard 
shock — not this soon?” 

The pack leader twisted his 



captive’s arm into a hammerlock. 
Keith cried out against the bone- 
bending pain. 

‘‘He’s going to get every shock 
treatment in the book,” Hobart 
swore. 

‘‘But why? He’ll come around 
once everything’s explained,” 
Laura promised. ‘‘Actually he 
leads a miserable existence but 
just doesn’t realize it. The Sphere- 
lets in his mound — ” 

Hobart turned the bitch around 
and shoved her back toward the 
village. “We’ve got only four 
days.” 

The Pack Leader released 
Keith’s arm and catapulted him 
forward, half burying his chest and 
head in one of the mounds. 

“Know what’s under you?” Ho- 
bart demanded. “That’s a human 
'being. Know what he’s doing 
there? He’s dead— rotting away. 
One of your Masters killed him.” 

Keith did not even listen to the 
nonsense as he spat dirt from his 
mouth. His arm swept slowly along 
the curving surface of the mound 
until his fingers encountered the 
crossed sticks. 

“This is a graveyard,” Hobart 
roared. “It’s full of dead people. 
Most were murdered by vicious 
bolts hurled by your Glorious 
Globes! But you wouldn’t know 
what a graveyard is, would you? 
You wouldn’t know about dead 
people or murder, either. Be- 
cause the Spheres are too tidy. 
They don’t leave carcasses lying 
around on their pinkways.” 

The Leader must be a mad- 
stud, Keith reflected. When Ho- 
bart spoke he made no sense. This

IF 




entire pack of strays was mostly 
madstuds and madbitches. In des- 
peration, he gripped the upright 
member of the crossed sticks. And 
it moved loosely in the dirt. 

“You’re not listening,” Hobart 
shouted, jerking Keith to his feet. 

Keith grinned through lacerated 
lips. Perliaps he couldn’t use his 
thoughts, as he did with the force 
stuff of the City, to make the dirt 
heave up and strike the Leader. 
But he could use the crossed 
sticks! 

Lunging, he brought them 
crashing down on Hobart’s head. 

He watched the Leadei^ fall. 
Then he charged off, heading for 
the brilliant glow beyond the for- 
est. 

II 

E nthralled by the magnifi- 
cent City of Force lying just 
ahead, Keith broke out of the for- 
est and paused. 

He stared in renewed wonder 
at the luminescent panorama. 
Emerald cylinders and flashing 
orange pyramids that stabbed high 
into the Blue Dome. Sheets of 
crackling energy, scintillating 
with every color, imaginable, flut- 
tering between blunt orchid cubes 
and slender yellow cones. Pure 
nonsubstance streamers that rose, 
wavering, from shimmering pur- 
ple obelisks, thin red pylons, gaily 
rotating ovoids. 

Surrounding the entire City was 
the can’t-see-through wall that 
prevented any of the personal 
people from even guessing that 
nonCity existed independent of 
City. 



Keith drew up before the great 
barrier. Even as he wondered 
whether it would let him in, the 
wall gaped open and a projection 
of crimson force stuff flicked out 
like a tongue to slide under his 
feet. It retracted, with him, into 
the City. 

The projection melted back 
into the carpet of pink radiance 
that lay everywhere. Keith fell 
to his knees in thanksgiving for 
his deliverance from the horrible 
village, from its uncouth mad- 
studs and madbitches. 

The majestic force structures of 
City Central were still distant. But 
closer, much closer, were many 
rows of glittering blue mounds. 
He was near one of the outlying 
moundhoods. From this per- 
spective he could see that he Was 
not too far from where he was 
kept. 

Free now, delivered from the 
indecency of Outside, he lifted his 
face to the Blue Dome — only, it 
was Gray now; since the Orb of 
All Orbs was hidden behind 
clouds. He let out an exuberant 
cry. Blunt projections rose from 
the radiant pink carpet all around 
him, developing awkward mouths 
that pantomimed his shout of 
triumph. ^ 

Finally he sat upon the coral 
radiance and thought-formed a 
large wave against his back. It 
rolled forward, sweeping him be- 
fore its crest. 

He ordered up slow propulsion 
at first, until he adjusted his bal- 
ance. Then he by intense concen- 
tration spurred on the wave to- 
ward the nearest pinkway. For 



OKINDAAASTER 



109 




now Keith was not more than a 
stray. He had to reach Kind Mas- 
ter before he ran afoul of the Peo- 
ple Catcher. 

B rilliant residential mounds 
were soon blurring by on either 
side of the pinkway. Only fine 
coordination of balance and 
thought impulses kept him from 
sliding back over the crest of his 
wave or being hurled into one of 
the force-mesh fences bordering 
the travel strip. 

He manag^ a sharp turn to the 
right, entering another pinkway. 
Soon he became aware of the 
other personal people, all safe and 
contented behind their force-mesh 
enclosures. If only he could reach 
his mound without incident! 

A Sphere approached from 
ahead, floating just above the 
pinkway. Kind Master? It could 
be, for Keith was in his own 
moundhood now. 

Respectfully, he planed well 
toward the edge of the strip as the 
Magnificent Being drifted by. No, 
that was not Kind Master. The 
silvery coloration differed and 
none of the memory-images that 
flicked in looping spirals along the 
Sphere’s surface was familiar. 

Passing the mound of Laura’s 
Master, Keith had only a con- 
temptuous scowl for the empty 
enclosure of sapphire force-net- 
ting that curved up and over the 
Sphere’s residence and swept all 
around it. Indeed, the Radiant 
Being who lived here was much 
better off with a personal person 
— if His personal person happened 
to be so treacherous a bitch. 



Presently Keith dismissed the 
propulsive wave and slid to a halt 
just outside his own enclosure. 
Mock arms reared from the ra- 
diant carpet and lifted him to his 
feet. Behind his heels twin wave- 
lets formed and moved him to- 
ward the fence. 

Provoked, he stom^ upon the 
elevations until the glistening pink 
carpet stretched once again into 
unbroken levelness. Of luxuries 
such as short-distance planing 
Keith would -have none — a dispo- 
sition instilled in him by his dear 
old gyp. 

At the fence, he inspected the 
force-mesh through which he had 
squeezed yesterUght. But all the 
crisscross strands of energy were 
back in place. The sapphire net- 
ting was one of those forms of 
nonsubstance that would not_r^ 
spond to human thought, yet 
Laura had breached it easily 
enough in order to let him out. 
How? 

He cupp^ his hands about his 
mouth. “Kind Master! Let me in! 
The pack is going to hurt our 
beautiful City of Force!’’ 

Of course, the Magnificent Be- 
ings could not hear people. But 
Kind Master might sense the des- 
peration behind his shouts and let 
him inmound. 

“Kind Master! Kind Master!" 

“l^NOCKitoff!’’ 

J^“What’s all the yapping 
about?’’ 

“Let’s have some quiet!’’ 

Irate voices rose in protest 
from enclosures up and down the 
pinkway.

IF 




. A hole opened in the shimmer- 
ing blue energy-substance of the 
next mound and out bounded a 
many-times-around female and 
one of her young: Gyp Emma and 
Bitchette Margo. 

“Your Master’s outmound,” 
the gyp revealed. 

She was considerably older 
than Keith. Although in fairly 
good shape, she had hair begin- 
ning to take on the striped-silver 
appearance of a meditating 
Sphere. Lines were forming in her 
face. Keith hoped that when it 
was time- for him to mate. Kind 
Master would search farther than 
nextmound. 

Gyp Emma gripped her force- 
mesh fence. “Where have you 
been all tolight and yesterlight?” 

“Outside. There really is an 
Outside! Horrible. No force stuff. 
Filled with impersonal people 
who steal us away and — ’’ He 
snapped his mouth shut. No 
sense telling her what he had 
learned.. She would blabber it 
throughout the moundhood and 
none of the personal people would 
even believe her. 

“Gyppy, he’s hurt.’’ Bitchette 
Margo had spotted the effects of 
Hobart’s backhands. “His lips 
are swollen. His — ’’ 

“Hush,’’ Emma ordered, dark 
eyes narrowed and alarmed. 

Thin arms shot up from the ra- 
diant carpet and grew tender lin- 
gers that explored his puffed lips. 

He shov^ the tendrils aside 
and they sank back into the en- 
ergy layer, “k’m all right,’’ he 
said, staring up at the Dome — 
dark now, though you could hard- 



ly notice the darkness against the 
sparkling brilliance' of everything 
in the City of Force. 

“What happens when people 
get too hurt, * gyppy?” Margo 
asked, in the fashion of curious 
youngsters, everywhere. 

“What a stupid question,” Em- 
ma scolded. “I did my duty. I 
taught you ways, and whys. I 
wouldn’t be surprised if Bulgy 
Ball — ” she nodded toward their 
mound — “finds you a Master of 
your own pretty soon. Yet you 
come out with stupid questions 
like that.” 

“Not stupid at all,” Keith said, 
wishing Kind Master would re- 
turn. “I often wonder about that 
myself. Seems there ought to be 
a limit to . how hurt you can get. 
Or how sick. Or how old.” 

“Stud Murdock, across the 
pinkway, is plenty old,” Margo 
reminded him. “But how old is 
too old? And what happens when 
you get there?” 

He could only shake his head. 
As if to mock his ignorance, three 
blank heads popp^ out of the 
coruscating energy-layer and 
swung from side'to side. “Maybe 
They, take you to another part of 
the City, to a Master who likes 
too-old people.” 

T WO Majestic Beings were 
passing. Gliding just above 
the roseate stardust ribbon. They 
swept along at a breathless pace, 
silvering the coral radiance be- 
neath Them with Their own warm 
glow. From the other direction 
came a single Magnificent One, 
carrying a budding Spherelet on 



O KIND MASTER 



111 




His downspeed side. The Sphere 
flow had started slacking off 
shortly after light-dark. But, now 
that dark-dark could be seen up- 
on the Donfc above the vividly 
luminous City, traffic was begin- 
ning to pick up again. 

“There’s Stud Murdock now!” 
Margo pointed. And from the 
lament force stuff beneath her, 
several skinny arms sprang up to 
level stiff index fingers at the 
mound across the pinlmay. 

Egbert Murdock, out of Gyp 
Clara Murdock, was stumbling 
around in his enclosure, groping. 

“Poor stud gets blinder every 
day,” observed Emma. “Lame, 
too.” 

Egbert’s limp was pronounced. 
His flesh seemed to have fled for 
some happier place, leaving be- 
hind only bone and wrinkled skin. 
And, even from across the pink- 
way, his frequent coughing could 
be heard. 

“He’s old, Keith, isn’t he?” 
Margo inquired. “Pretty old, 
huh?” 

“You know,” Emma said, 
“there’s a rumor about Murdock. 
He—” 

“I’-ve heard.” Keith tried to 
head her off. 

But she was determined to ex- 
hume the scandal. “They say Gyp 
Murdock Wasn’t properly put to 
stud. Her- Master hadn’t planned 
anything at all. She — ” 

“Yes, I know.” Keith stemmed 
her flow of words as he watched 
compliant force-stuff arms rise in 
Egbert’s yard to catch him when- 
ever he stumbled. But proud old 
stud that he -was, he had enough 



self-reliance left to slap them 
away. 

“Keith,” said Margo, “you 
think maybe Stud Murdock is 
too old?” 

“Hush!” Emma reproved. “As 
I was saying. Gyp Murdock 
wasn’t a gyp at all. Breeding 
wasn’t prearranged. There was 
this stray stud and — and — oh, 
poor Egbert!” 

B ut the old fellow, Keith re- 
flected, had carri^ his hu- 
miliation well over all these hot- 
colds; So well that no one dared 
talk about his questionable origin 
while he was around. 

“Look,” exclaimed Bitchette 
Margo, while glistening pink 
hands rose again to point for her. 
“There’s a hole in. his mesh. He’s 
coming out!” 

Indeed, Stud Murdock was up- 
on the pinkway now, crossing. 

“Watch out, Egbert!” Emma' 
screamed. 

The Sphere missed him by the 
length of his beard. He spun 
twice before force-stuff hands 
shot up to steady him. After a fit 
of coughing, he came the rest of 
the way seated on the foreslope of 
a radiant wave. 

“That was a close one, Egbert,” 
Keith sympathized. 

“Yep — might have — got— 
hurt,” the old stud said between 
coughs. Trembling, he ordered up 
an energy-substance bench from 
the force stuff underfoot. Keith 
shared it with him, but found that 
he had to supply the continuous 
thought impulses to keep it from 
withering out of shape. 



112 



IF 




*‘How did that hole get in your 
mesh, Stud Murdock?'* asked, 
Margo hanging on the fence. 

“It was — cough— }usi there. I 
think — cough - cough — Gentle 
Globe made it. Maybe He wants 
me to get out and have — cough- 
cough — a little fun.” 

Emma laughed. “What kind of 
fun could you have now?” 

“None. Tm worried.” 

“About what?” 

“About Gentle Globe.” Eg- 
bert's 'breathing sounded like the 
hissing of the sparks that occa- 
sionally showered from the mound 
ceilings. “He keeps me by Him a 
lot now. And He's always a deep 
blue. I've never seen a sadder 
Sphere" 

“What's He sad about?” 

“Wish r knew. Maybe I could 
do something to make Him turn 
orange and green with happiness 
again.” 

Keith was first to feel the tin- 
gling, bristling sensation that 
seemed to take root and grow, to 
die out and grow again, deep 
within his thoughts. 

“Stud Murdock,'' Margo 
shouted through her fence. “Gen- 
tle Globe's calling you. Don't you 
feel Him?” 

“Eh?" 

Keith stared across the pink-^ 
way. Sure enough. The old stud's’^ 
Master was drifting impatiently 
back and forth behind the energy- 
mesh enclosure, hurling thought 
commands at Egbert. 

Obediently, Murdock started 
across the ribbon of coral stardust 
— and promptly was hit by a 
speeding Sphere. 



He lay on the pinkway for a 
while, then gathered himself up 
and, holding his chest, rode an 
ill-shaped wave back to his en- 
closure. 

Much later, after Emma and 
Margo had been called inmound 
,and the pale Lesser Orb was 
hanging low in its Dark Dome, 
Keith lost hope that his Master 
would return before next light- 
light. 

Accumulated exhaustion drove 
him to the edge of sleep as he sat 
against the outside of his impene- 
trable fence. He shielded his eyes 
against the dazling ^crimson lu- 
minosity of the underlying energy 
layer, the sparkling sapphire ra- 
diance of the force-mesh fepces, 
the shimmering blue brilliance of 
the mounds all around him, the 
magnificent coruscations of City 
Central's great geometric force- 
stuff edifices. 

Thirsty, still dirty from his 
forced stay Outside, he concen- 
trate upon the pink radiance, 
ordering up a huge bowl. He 
thought upon it an extreme cold- 
ness. In moments the film of 
moisture condensing on its inner 
surface formed ^ drops and ran 
down to begin filling the con- 
tainer. 

From cupped hands he drank 
his fill, then splashed the remain- 
der upon his face, arms, chest, 
feet. Feeling cleaner now, he al- 
lowed the bowl to sink back into 
the levelness of the luminous car- 
pet. 

Then he thought-excavated a 
trench in the radiance and lay in 
it. He let the pink nonsubstance 



OKINDAAASTER 



113 




flow back over him until only a 
small part of his face remained 
exposed. For, while he slept tmd 
awaited Kind Master’s return, he 
must make certain that he would 
become the prey of neither Ho- 
bart’s returning strays nor the 
People Catcher. 

Ill 

B abbling voices awoke 
Keith. He stared through the 
gap in his force-stuff covering. It 
was light-light. And the Magnifi- 
cent Metropolis was never more 
lustrously alive than now — during 
Food-Collecting Time. 

Showers of sparks sprayed 
from the countless energy-materi- 
al structures — mounds and 
moundplexes — pyramids and py- 
lons and spires — cones, cyUnders 
and great iridescent ovoids. From 
the multidinous surfaces also, sil- 
veiy ribbons reached out, waver- 
ing gracefully, toward the Orb on 
High. The dazzling streamers 
were greedily sucking up its warm 
energy substance. Golden drop- 
lets formed along the ribbons, 
slid down, merged into larger pel- 
lets, then sank into the luminous 
surfaces of the structures: food- 
stuff to feed the Masters and 
their obedient personal people 
and even replenish the forms of 
the City. 

Keith heard Margo exclaim 
nextmound, “I saw it all! These 
two Spheres came and took him 
off down the pinkway on a sit- 
down wave.” 

“How did he look?” 

“Not so good. Moaned and 
held his chest. Gyppy, what’s go- 



ing to happen to Stud Murdock, 
huh?” 

“Hush, Margo. Egbert has just 
become too old, I guess. Maybe 
it’s like Keith says — They find 
new Masters for too-old people 
somewhere else in the City.” 

Then Keith could sense Bulgy 
Ball calling Emma and Margo 
back inmound. Which was just as 
well. He didn’t feel like talking 
with bitches or anyone else. He 
concentrated on how he would try 
to tell Kind Master about the 
treacherous strays Outside-of-the- 
City. 

But other voices suddenly as- 
sailed his ears. 

“Here we go!” 

“Around the bend!” 

“Spur your wave. Hank. Fast- 
er.” 

“Watch out, d^mn stinkin’ 
Spheres. We’ll run you down — ” 
“Yip-ee! Look at all those 
locked-up suckers.” 

Dismayed, Keith shrank within 
the covered trench he had 
thought-molded for himself. Ho- 
bart and his strays! 

They were not wearing their 
“animal hides” now — so the 
Spheres would not guess they 
were from Outside-of-the-City. 

. But already the personal people 
in many enclosures were rising to 
the vocal challenge of the pack: 
“Scram . Get lost . .” 

“Leave us alone. We got us a 
.nice moundhood.” 

“Look for your bitches some- 
where else!” 

“I hope the People Catcher 
gets you — all of you.” 

“Go back Outside!” 



114 



IF 




Keith was about to add his 
lusty voice to the customary out- 
cries. Then he remembered that 
Outside-of-the-City was not just 
a foul word, but a real and terri- 
ble place. So he concentrated on 
preventing any imitation mouths 
from forming in the radiant car- 
pet and betraying his hiding 
place. 

He could tell from the nearness 
and loudness of the shouted bar- 
rage that the pack had stopped in 
front of his hWng place. With in- 
tense concentration, so that he 
would not accidentally manipu- 
late any part of the energy layer 
■in his defense and thus give away 
his position, he began counting 
baclward from a hundred. 

“Well,” said Hobart, “he’s not 
here, unless he’s inmound.” 

“Why don’t , we just forget 
about him?” queri^ another 
stray. 

“I want him,” Hobart growled. 
“Laura will keep an eye on his 
mound while we go make our 
other two pickups.” 

The^ strays continued on their 
way, returning insult for insult at 
full lungpower. 

“Lick your Master’s belly!” . 
“Locked-up suckers . .” 

“Break out. Learn what it 
means to be free!” 

“Fetch, boy. Good boy. Fetch, 
and you get a force-food ball!” 
Only when the pack was well 
away did Keith emerge. Down the 
pinlway, the shouting strays were 
being swept toward City Central 
on frothing stand-up waves. 

A glance in the other direction 
revealed Bitch Laura, wearing no 



“hide” now, staring at him from 
within her old enclosure. 

Should he force her to reveal 
what foul new conspiracy was 
hatching? Or wait here for Kind 
Master and try to tell Him what 
was going on? Or follow Hobart 
and learn what the pack was up 
to? 

Deciding, he ordered up a 
swift sit-down wave. As it pro- 
pelled him along the pinkway in 
pursuit of the strays, he thought- 
molded another wave immediate- 
ly in front of him. Riding in the 
trough between the two crests, he 
could p<«k over the forward one 
yet remain hidden behind it. 

S OME of the strays abandoned 
their force-stuff conveyences 
and went loping ahead in broad, 
ranging strides. Others still rode. 
“On and on!” 

“Charge!” 

“Join the fun, you miserable 
locked-up people!” 

“Rise! We’ll help you escape 

Hobart, riding the foremost 
wave, was shouting more loudly 
than any of them as the wind 
whipped his red hair and beard 
backward. 

The pinkway wound through an 
area of great moundplexes, some 
piled many layers high. Keith re- 
mained well behind the pack, not 
only to spy from a safe distance 
but also to savor the spectacle of 
the magnificent structures. Never 
before had he viewed them from 
such close range.. Radiant Spheres 
were drifting in and out of them 
at all levels. 



O KIND MASTER 



115 




The ribbon of pink stardust 
climbed sharply, curving around 
one of the marvelous clusters of 
mounds. Here it had sprouted 
many minor coral ram^ that 
struck off and disappeared among 
recesses in the towering azure 
’plex. The main pinkway itself 
continued on toward the lofty 
energy-material structures of City 
Central. 

Ahead, the shouting resumed. 
Three of the strays had found a 
slow-moving Sphere. Two were 
sprinting in front of Him and the 
third planed alongside the Mas- 
ter, feet planted on the foreslope 
of a small, swift wave. They were 
all shouting: 

“Damn bully-ball! Put ’em 
up!” • 

“Ya-a-a-h! Your poppa was ob- 
late.” 

“Stop and fight — ” 

“Come on, boys. We got ’im on 
the run!” 

Hardly had Hobart’s voice 
risen above .the general yelping 
with “Don’t lay it on too thick!” 
when the Sphere flushed His sur- 
face with a menacing yellow hue 
and cast a vicious bolt. 

The stud on His right caught 
the sizzling streak in the chest 
and collapsed, charred over most 
of his body. Resilvering, the 
Sphere swept on while the pack 
gathered around the stricken stud. 

Curious, Keith brought his sit- 
down and hide-behind waves al- 
most to a halt but continued to 
think-direct them forward slowly, 
peering over the advance one. 

Four Magnificent Masters 
passed him, but none seemed to 



pay any attention to the pack as- 
sembled around the charred, still 
stud. Too charred?- Too still? 

As though in outright revolt, 
Keith’s hide-behind wave abrupt- 
ly lost its form and disintegrated 
into scores of long projections 
that coiled back around his arms 
and legs and held him rigidly. 
Only then did Hobart, still quite 
a few wavelengths ahead, turn 
and laugh. 

“Thought it was you all along,” 
the Leader boasted. “Hold him, 
boys. But watch out for his back- 
lash.” 

Mortified, Keith thought- 
molded a huge cudgel out of the 
radiant carpet immediately in 
front of Hobart. But even as it 
drew back and swung at the Lead- 
er’s head, a much thicker club 
reared up to parry the blow. 

Then one of the stringy projec- 
tions tightened around Keith’s 
neck and he could no longer even 
think of attack. 

“Watkins, Adler, LeBlanc,” 
Hobart called out. “Concentrate 
on freezing all the force stuff 
around here, except what I want 
to use.” 

The Leader came over and 
hauled Keith erect while the re- 
straining nqnsubstance projec- 
tions became limp and slid off his 
body. 

Gasping for breath, he ordered 
up a dozen forms of attack against 
the red-bearded Hobart and his 
strays. Stout projections to blud- 
geon them. Yawning pits beneath 
their feet. Strands of force stuff 
to bind them. But none of his as- 
sault devices materialized. Once 



116 



IF 




again , he was a captive of the un- 
couth Hobart from Outside. And 
none of the passing Spheres 
seem^ even concerned. 

Gripping Keith’s beard, Hobart 
led him over to the charred stray. 

“Filthy lightning-hurling 
fiend!” The Leader swore. He 
jerked Keith’s head forward. 
“This, you ignorant animal, is a 
dead man! Take a good look!” 

“Why doesn’t he get up?” 
Kejth asked nervously. 

Hobart only scowl^. 

“Is he too still?” 

“Yeah, he’s too still — dead ' 
still!” 

“What’s ‘dead’ still?” 

Hobart unleashed the back of 
his hand and it stung Keith across 
the mouth. “You poor, stupid, de- 
generate specimen,” the Leader 
said. 

The other studs stood with 
bowed heads. A projection of the 
pinkway folded the too-still one’s 
hands across his seared chest, 
then he began sinkijig slowly into 
the energy layer. Glistening force 
stuff flowed over and around him, 
restoring the pinkway’s unbroken 
surface. 

“¥>EOPLE CATCHER! Peo- 

i pie Catcher!” 

The strays picked up Hobart’s 
cry and backed away toward City 
Central on reverse stand-up 
waves. 

Tinged with the rich violet of 
annoyance aiid the deep russet of 
determination, the dread Sphere 
came charging around the curve. 
Trailing behind and -above Him, 
in the most convenient position 



for casting, was His tightly knit 
sapphire mesh. 

The Leader snatched Keith’s 
arm as though determined not to 
lose his captive. He thought- 
molded a propulsive swell, large 
enough to accommodate bbth of 
them. More afraid of the People 
Catcher than the pack, Keith 
went along without resistance. 
Carrying double, however, their 
escape wave was a bit slower than 
those hurling the other studs to 
the edge of the elevated pinkway. 

The People Catcher’s net was 
already swinging in widening cir- 
cles. As the fleeing strays let their 
waves wash them over the edge of 
the ribbonway, the People Catch- 
er was upon Keith and Hobart. 
His net flared. 

Horrified as he watched the 
green mesh descending upon 
them, Keith wrested free of Ho- 
bart’s grip, made his part of the 
mutual wave hurl him forward 
along the pihkway. Looking back, 
he saw the Leader being launched 
over the side by a slingshot of 
force stuff — ^just in time to escape 
a second throw of the cast net. 
Reprieved by the fearsome 
Sphere’s pursuit of Hobart, Keith 
propelled himself City Central- 
ward on a towering swell of coral 
stardust. 

There were many Spheres rid- 
ing the pinkway now, all indiffer- 
ent to the drama of the People 
Catcher and the escaping strays. 
In this heavier traffic Keith had 
to concentrate on guiding his sit- 
down wave. The horror of the too- 
charred, too-still stray remained 
fresh in his mind although he 



O KIND MASTER 



117 




could comprehend nothing of 
what had happened. 

Keith’s wave bore him between 
two Spheres and around a loop- 
ing curve of the ribbon as it as- 
cended another moundplex. He 
hazarded a second reaiward look. 
Aglow with the russet of determi- 
nation, the People Catcher was 
coming along at full speed. 

In the same glance, from 
around the inside of the curve, 
Keith had been able to see whatr 
had happened to Hobart and the 
other strays. They had thou^ht- 
manipulat^ the edge of the pink- 
way into long, dangling streamers 
and were shinning down them in- 
to- the lower recesses of Radiant 
City. 

The People Catcher was gain- 
ing on Keith. He demanded more 
spi^ of his^ave. He weaved in 
and out of the transient Spheres. 
Dipping sharply from its disying 
height, the ribbon carried him in-^ 
to the core of City Central, its 
great, glistening geometric shapes 
rising majestically above him. 

He swept past coruscating 
spires, beautiful emerald cylin- 
ders that rotated ceaselessly, ta- 
pering pyramids displaying many- 
colored splotches upon their rest- 
less surfaces, iridescent ovoids 
spinning gaily upon their ends. 

An orange-tinted cube, twirling 
as it balanced atop a fluorescing 
tower, loosed a fountain of sparks 
— happy sparks that danced and 
gamboled as they splashed down 
upon lesser edifices. 

Oh, the beauty of City Central! 
The shimmering translucence of 
all the majestic forms, translu- 



cence that betrayed the presence 
inside of many Magnificent 
Spheres! But who could ever 
guess what they were doing? And 
overhead were awesome displays 
of flaming curtains and whirling 
halos and dasling beams, rip- 
pling ribbons of pure silver and 
tenuous, luminous veils of opales- 
cent energy. All so bright that 
they bedimmed even the Orb of 
All Orbs. 

Keith drank in the breathtaking 
display. Here he was, realizing his 
fervent hope: access to City Cen- 
tral! Deeply he resented the stud 
named Hobart who would wrest 
him from all of this and take him 
to that hellish Outside. 

Yet he was grateful, too. If it 
had not been for Hobart’s strays 
he would not now be cruising 
through this paradise of splendor. 

Swish! The People Catcher’s 
net landed ' on the ribbonway, 
barely missing Keith. 'Another 
cast and he would be captured. 

Remembering how Hobart and 
the pack had escaped, Keith sum- 
moned a final measure of will 
power and had his wave catapult 
him over the side of the pinkway. 
As he fell he ordered the prim- 
rose stardust of the ribbon’s edge 
to extend a streamer.to him. 

But he was plunging faster than 
the projection was stretching 
down! The People Catcher’s net, 
however, descended faster still. 

IV 

S CARCELY old enough to be 
away from his gyp a pre-stud 
sat on his haunches and wailed. 
In another enclosure across the 



118 



IF 




pinkaisle, a towheaded bitch 
tossed her weight against the sap- 
phire mesh and screamed to be let 
out of the pound. 

A forlorn bitchette kept mur- 
muring, “O, Dear Radiant 
Roundness, come and get me!” 
In the next pen a surly stud paced 
back and forth, cursing incessant- 
ly- 

Keith turned over on his side 
and remolded the coral force- 
stuff slab on which he had lain all 
dark-dark. But no matter how 
much softness he thoujght into the 
lambent energy material he could 
find no comfort against his be- 
wilderment. Miserable, he rose 
and stood shuddering. 

“Had it roughj hey?” That 
from the stud in the next pen. 

“I want my Kind Master,” 
Keith whined. 

“Don’t worry. He’ll come — if 
He is kind.” 

“How do you know?” ^ 

“I’ve been through this. Fifth 
time around.” The ^impounded 
stud was past his prime as a 
breeder. His hair and beard were 
streaked with the gray hue of a 
tired Sphere. His shoulders 
slumped. He had too much belly. 

“What if my Master doesn’t 
come?” 

The stud shrugged. “They’ll 
take you down the aisle there and 
put you in that black compart- 
ment and — ” 

“Yes?” 

“And make yob too still.” 

“Too hurt?” 

“Oh, I don’t know about that. 
But definitely too still.” 

“Too— ‘dead’?” That was the 



word Hobart had used, wasn’t it? 

“How’s that?” 

“Forget it.” Keith shook his 
head. Everything was so confus- 
ing. As he tried to sort his 
thoughts a sound caught his ear. 
A familiar sound. Was it possi- 
ble? There it went again. 

“Cough-cough — ” 

That confused him still more. 
Why was Egbert Murdock here? 
Murdock had not been caught by 
the People Catcher. 

“Hey, Egbert,” Keith shouted. 
“How you feeling tolight?” 

Murdock only clutched his ribs 
and coughed. 

At the end of the pinkaisle the 
mesh parted and in glided the 
People Catcher' With Him was 
Murdock’s Gentle Globe! It was 
easy to recognize Him. He was 
blue all over and bright thought- 
images of Murdock could be seen 
flowing across His surface. 

They opened Egbert’s mesh and 
caused a gentle wave to sweep 
him out and down the aisle. He 
sat with arms folded, smiling 
slightly as though in anticipation 
of a pleasant surprise, as the wave 
plan^ him into the black-walled 
enclosure. 

Gentle Globe and the People 
Catcher waited for a time. Then 
the black wall opened and Egbert, 
lying down, was swept out and 
propelled by a wave-form along 
the pinkaisle and out of the 
pound. He did not seem too hurt 
any longer. But after having be- 
come too caught, he now ap- 
peared too still, Keith reflected. 

Gentle Globe followed, radiat- 
ing a deeper blue than Keith had 



O KIND MASTER 



119 




ever seen. It was all so puzzling. 
So confusing. 

The People Catcher glided back 
to Keith, breached the sapphire 
mesh of his pen. When a wave be- 
gan pushing him in the direction 
of the black-walled place, he sud- 
denly felt that he ought to be 
afraid of an enclosure that made 
people too still. 

But abruptly the wave sank 
back into the levelness of the 
pinkaisle and the People Catcher 
glazed over with silver-gray indif- 
ference. 

And when Keith looked down 
the aisle, there was Kind Master 
drifting his way, brightly orange- 
green and anxious to see His per- 
sonal person again. 

Keith hurled himself upon the 
Magnificent One and with out- 
stretched arms fondled His under- 
surface. And scores of hands 
raised themselves out of the aisle 
to pet the Grand Sphere,' helping 
Keith express his gratitude. 

Ohi how desperately he had 
wanted to be reunited with Kind 
Master! He would never run afoul 
of the People Catcher again! He 
would never let Hobart take him 
Out side-of-the-City ! 

Outside? Of course. The vil- 
lagers— theif conspiracy! 

“Kind Master!” Keith leaped 
up and down, waving his arms. 
“There’s a bunch of strays trying 
to hurt our beautiful City! They’re 
stealing Your personal people! 
They live Outside-of-the-City and 
»» 

Around and around the tower- 
ing Globe he went, while the ra- 
diant carpet recoiled to hurl him 



to heights almost' level with the 
Master’s upper pole. And dozens 
of hand's rose from the force-stuff 
layer to help him plead for com- 
prehension froth the Splendid Be- 
ing. 

But the Majestic One only dis- 
played the orange-green of con- 
tentment in splotches all over His 
surface. It was no use. There was 
noway to make Him understand 

A slim projection of nonsub- 
stance snaked up out of the ener- 
gy layer and looped around 
Keith’s neck. Then, as Kind Mas- 
ter drifted down the pinkaisle, the 
leash followed, remaining at- 
tached to the coral carpet at all 
points along the way and drawing 
Keith along with it. 



P erhaps as an expression of 
the Kind One’s joy at having 
him back, Keith was allowed in- 
mound that dark-dark. 

While the Radiant Being dozed 
comfortably in His fluorescing 
niche, Keith kept a wary eye on 
the two Spherelets, Innocent De- 
mon and Little Imp. He had for- 
gotten about them. 

Occasionally Demon was as- 
suming a mischievous cinnamon 
hue, drifting over to him, then 
shading off into.the yellow colora- 
tion of bolt-hurling readiness. But 
each time the tinge was flushed 
off His surface by the sable tint of 
frustration when He perceived 
that Keith was not about to budge 
from his sanctuary almost directly 
beneath the Master’s lustrous ro- 
tundity. Innocent’s bolts hurt, 
and Keith did not intend to ab- 



120 



IF 




sorb any more of them than he 
had to. 

Throughout most of the dark- 
dark Imp, too, drifted back and 
forth along the sparkling azure 
wall of the mound. He kept flash- 
ing in a succession of hues— from 
the violet of annoyance into His 
boiling yellow bolt-hurling sheen. 
Then, flushed with power He dare 
not use so close to the Parent 
grayed over in slumber. Imp 
would drain off all that fierce en- 
ergy into the coral otfpet. Imme- 
diately he~ would register the blu- 
ish green of disappointment, fol- 
low^ by the total nonradiance of 
blighted hope and once again the 
violet of annoyance to start the 
cycle all over again. 

About middark-dark, sparking 
time came and Keith rose, fully 
alert, in order to miss none of the 
beauty of this incomprehensible 
happening. 

Along the vaulted turquoise 
ceiling, vivid splotches of scarlet 
light chased one another in a 
dance interrupted only when two 
of the blobs collided. Then show- 
ers of hissing sparks ^scaded out 
and down. Everywhere they fell, 
the blue force material of the 
walls and the soft energy s(uff of 
the floor would take on new, glow- 
ing splendor. 

Kind Master, still hover-dozing 
in His alcove, stirred and turned 
lazily about his axis. His surface 
taking on the silvery tinge of 
wakefulness. 

As Innocent Demon and Little 
Imp hid behind the-golden foun- 
tain, Keith resumed his attempt 
to communicate the treachery. 



“Don’t You understand. Mas- 
ter? They’re Outside. They’re tak- 
ing away personal people. The 
strays want to hurt our Magnifi- 
cent Metropolis!’’ 

Countless pairs of imploring 
arms grew out of the carpet to 
mimic his supplicating gestures. 

But it was futile. He just wasn’t 
getting through to Kind Master! 

Keith glanced at the alcove’s 
lustrous wall just as several force- 
food balls were popping out of 
the places where they had been 
emb^ded. They hovered ' just 
above his head — delicious mor- 
sels from the Orb of All Orbs. 
Sphere food! And they were to be 
his, if only he did what was ex- 
pected of him. 

Excited, he sprang into the air 
and came dqwn on his palms. He 
teetered for a moment but finally 
held still, arms stiff and corded 
as they supported his inverted 
form. Oh, these were the happy 
times — ^when Master was awake 
and Imp and Demon hid on the 
other side of the sparkling foun- 
tain! 

He sprang erect and Master let 
one of the pellets drop into his 
mouth. Delicious. Sphere food 
was a rapture in itself. 

Next, the twirling handsprings. 
But careful! Not too far away 
from the Radiant One or he would 
be exposed to bolts from the 
Spherelets. 

More force-food balls. 

Then the cartwheels. With 
Master glowing orange-green all 
over. And more delectable pel- 
lets to melt in his mouth and 
trickle down his throat. 



O KIND MASTER 



121 




Tiring, the Glorious Sphere fi- 
nally filmed over with the gray 
tinge of slumber. 



K eith felt contentment too. 

Really, why bother about the 
threat — threat, indeed — of Ho- 
bart and his wretched strays? Cer- 
tainly they could do nothing to 
harm the Radiant Ones and Their 
City. 

He stepi^ closer to Kind Mas- 
ter, sent his eyes roving over His. 
surface, Occasionally something 
would attract his attention and 
he would return again and again 
to the spot. 

Most of the memory-pictures 
that flowed fuzzily across the 
sleep-grayed- surface of the 
Sphere, however, w^e as incom- 
prehensible as the Illustrious 
Ones Themselves and Their Mag- 
nificent Metropolis. 

Here: a sequence of idea-im- 
ages limned in vivid colors — 
memories of a flight over the 
pinkways of City Central. There: 
great flashes of light and shim- 
mering nimbuses climbing pearly 
walls and occasionally arranging 
themselves into rings that linked 
and unlinked. They were recollec- 
tions of happenings in the lofty 
spire to which Master went every 
dark-light and . returned every 
light-dark. 

Oh, if only he could understand 
some of these idea-pictures and 
memoir-images that flicked — 
sometimes in spirals, sometimes 
in great curves— across Master’s 
surface! 

Working his way around the 



Sphere, Keith suddenly came up- 
on an image that he could under- 
stand — almost. 

There, in the animated scene, 
was Kind Master. And next to 
Him was someone else’s Master. 
They were within the sapphire 
force-stuff enclosure just outside 
the Very mound he was in now. 

Between them stood a bitch. 

Sensing the meaning behind 
the image, Keith tried desperately 
to make out her 'features. Impos- 
sible. For a Master was not good 
at telling personal people apart — 
except His own personal person, 
of course. The bitch was without 
detail in the Sphere’s memory. 

Nevertheless Keith wanted to 
know what she looked like. For he 
sensed that she was going to be 
put to stud. And, just as certainly, 
he knew he would be the stud. For 
the first time he was going to con- 
summate his studship. 

Keith, in- his pride and anticipa- 
tion, forgot all about Demon and 
Imp. But Little Imp, taking ad- 
vantage of His Parent’s slumber, 
had glided from behind the golden 
fountain and was flaring with the 
vivid orange-green of delight. The 
hues rainbowed through the cin- 
namon of mischief-contemplation 
and turned a threatening yellow. 

The Spherelet hurled his bolt. 

Scoring a near-miss, the siz- 
zling streak produced the smell of 
seated flesh and an ugly welt on 
Keith’s shoulder. 

Enraged, he lunged from be- 
hind Master and ordered the ra- 
diant carpet to spin him around — 
just in time to s^e Innocent De- 
mon turning cinnamon. 



122 



IF 




But before Demon could dedde 
upon a method of torment, Keith 
made a great wave of the floor 
wash him across the room. He 
rained a series of indignant kicks 
against the Spherelet’s surface; 

The little Master turned pea- 
green with fear and scurried, to- 
gether with Imp, into the sparkl- 
ing alcove beside their Parent. As 
they arrived. Kind Master was 
silvering with wakefulness— a re- 
action, no doubt, to the fright- 
thoughts assailing Him fropi His 
Spherelets. 

And. His mercurial cast imme- 
diately gave way to yellow. The 
tinge collected into a small dot on 
His surface and came hurtling at 
Keith — an ominous zigzag bolt! 

It melted a huge area of the 
carpet immediately in front of 
him. Only a warning bolt, luckily. 

Then the floor of pink stardust 
molded a cresting wave taller 
than Keith himself. It swept him 
toward the thick azure wall of the 
mound. The wall spread open 
long enough for him to be washed 
out into the yard. Then it closed 
behind him. 

V 

N ext Ught-Ught, Keith hud- 
dled in his sulking corner out- 
mound, drawing little comfort 
from the Orb on High’s warmth. 
Imp’s mischievous bolt had left 
his shoulder raw. And there were 
blisters on his legs, raised by the 
sparks from Kind Master’s warn- 
ing bolt. 

He was busy think-dismissing 
the solicitous hands of force stuff 

O KIND MASTER 



that insisted upon exploring his 
hurts when he noticed a Radiant 
Being drifting toward his enclo- 
sure. The Magnificent One floated 
at such a height as to api^r to be 
a gigantic, silvery head sitting up- 
on the shoulders of the bitch who 
trailed behind Him on a nonsub- 
stance leash. 

But what a bitch! What a body! 

His captivated stare was ac- 
companied by dozens of spurious, 
unseeing eyes flung up on long- 
stemmed stalks out of the radiant 
ground before him. 

His bitch! Keith sensed it. He 
could not quite see her face, not 
at this angle. But her swaying 
hips displayed a graceful rhythm. 
Her skin was firm and smooth 
with youth. Surely she was a first- 
time-out bitch. 

When her Master reached the 
fence, its sapphire netting parted. 
She was washed into the enclo- 
sure, the leash slipping from her 
neck and sinking into the pink-fa- 
diance. Restoring the fence’s en- 
ergy strands, the Sphere with- 
drew down the pinkway. 

“Hello, there,’’ Keith began ex- 
citedly — tritely, too, he realized. 
“Are you ready for—’’ 

The bitch turned to face_ him 
and he gaped. Laura! From the 
mound down the pinkway. From 
Hobart’s village, too. 

He sprang. “I’ve got her. Kind 
Master,’’ he shouted over his 
shoulder. “I’ve got the treacher- 
ous Outside bitch!’’ 

A projection of force stuff rose 
to snag his lunging instep and he 
plopped to the radiant carpet. 

Even so, he thought, this was 

123 




not her village. This was his terri- 
tory. He would show her. He 
thought-fashioned a lariat out of 
the carpet and thought-hurled its 
loop^ catching her around the 
waist. 

But she plucked from her hair 
the short, Hat bar she had used 
four yesterlights ago to free him 
from his enclosure. She touched 
the noose with the thing. Instantly 
it sucked up the whole lariat, to- 
gether with the part of the energy 
layer to which the lariat had been 
attached. 

“Keith,” she said, “I’ve got to 
make you understand that — ” 

He thought-tossed coils of pink 
radiance around her ankles and 
tried to think-tug her off her feet. 
Again she used the bar to suck up 
the coils. While she was thus oc- 
cupied, however, he made the 
coral carpet catapult him toward 
her. She had expected that. She 
thought-erected a hard shell of 
nonsubstance. He slammed head- 
long into it, the impact felling 
him. 

Cunningly he remained motion- 
less while the pink carpet restored 
its levelness. 

She hurried to him on a small 
stand-up wave. 

“Keith, are you all right? Did I 
hurt you?” 

He might have got away with 
his deception. Except that while 
he lay still, he caused several 
arms to ease up out of the energy 
layer and reach for her. 

“Sorry,” she said. 

And a piece of the backyard 
whacked his skull, bringing on 
unfeigned unconsciousness. 



C OMING to, he heard the 
cries. 

“Yipee! Suckers. Suckers!” 

“Get out of the way, damn 
blubber balls!” 

“I’m a stray . Hooray, hoo- 
ray ...” 

“Don’t you suckers want to es- 
cape and have some fun?” 

“Faster. Ride the pinkway. Let 
freedom ring!” 

As Hobart and his pack came 
sweeping around the curve on 
cresting waves, Laura held her 
bar close to the fence mesh. The 
sapphire strands squirmed out of 
shape, fashioning a large hole. 

But the whole moundhood was 
shouting back at the villagers 
now: 

“Hit the pinkway, you filthy 
strays!” 

“Go back where you came 
from—” 

“People Catcher! Where’s the 
People Catcher?” 

Keith launched himself at 
Laura. Seizing her with one hand, 
he reached for the small bar with 
the other. But she tossed iCto Ho- 
bart through the opening in the 
mesh. 

A projection of nonsubstance 
shot up from the carpet, looped 
around Keith’s neck and yanked 
him away from Laura. 

Hobart barked orders. 

“Johnson, Adler, DuBois, keep 
all this energy-layer stuff immo- 
bilized. Laura, come on out. Hit 
the pinkway for the village. Hank, 
Bradford; see that she gets there 
okay.” 

Laura hurried through the gap 
in the mesh. 



124 



IF 




“Came as soon as McAllister 
brought your message,” the Pack. 
Leader said. “We get here in 
time?” 

She nodded, then summoned 
up the pinkwave that would take 
her, together with Hank and 
Bradford, back Outside. 

“Go easy on him,” she advised, 
as she thought-washed herself 
away. “He can be brought 
around. I’m sure.” 

Keith surged against his chok- 
ing neck-shackle. “Bring her 
back,” he screamed. “She’s my 
bitch.” 

Hobart came through the mesh. 
“Okay, boys, let the force stuff 
loose. I’ll take over.” 

Even as the honsubstance fet-' 
ter flipped from Keith’s throat, he 
thought-molded a bludgeon out 
of the radiant carpet and directed 
it to club the Leader’s head. 

But Hobart’s devastating 
knuckles smashed into Keith’s 
face first. 

D ark. Dark. Such frightful 
darkness, thought Keith. 
Shrinking from the vast nonra- 
diance that engulfed the village, 
he reached down to the strips of 
hide that bound his feet. 

“Don’t touch' thoSfe,” Hobart 
shouted out of the adjacent dark. 
“And keep those clothes on. 
We’re human out here.” 

Keith waited for the backhand. 
This time it did not come. 

“Let me try reasoning with 
him,” Laura urged from other 
darkness. 

“Shock’s the medicine, not rea- 

___ ” 



“I’d say this one can’t be hu- 
manized, Ho,” ventured a stray 
assigned to guard Keith. 

Hobart swore, “He’ll make it or 
die trying.” 

“But that boatload of magnets 
is due tomorrow. We attack the 
City at nightfall. It’s impossible 
to bring him around before then.” 

“We’ve got to take time to 
prove out this test case,” Laura 
persisted. “If he doesn’t come 
through, that could mean we’ll 
find ourselves with hundreds of 
people on our hands who’ll sim- 
ply die without their lousy Mas- 
ters.” 

“Take time? So the Spheres 
will have a chance to detect our 
magnets?” Hobart stomped off in 
a huff. Keith watched the Leader 
kneel and, after a while, produce 
one of those bundles of dancing 
yellow projections that strays 
called “fire.” 

Laura, in animal hides, studied 
Keith intently. She moved closer 
and the guard halved his dis- 
tance. 

“You’ll be all right, Keith,” 
she comforted. “The darkness 
around us is only natural. You’ll 
get used to it.” 

What a miserable place, Keith 
thought. Thick forest cut off star- 
light, moonlight, even the glow of 
the distant City. The wan fire was 
a laughable substitute for the 
magnificent radiances and sparkl- 
ing illuminations that the spheres 
knew. 

“You see, Keith, we must de- 
stroy the City and free the per- 
sonal people. We have a moral 
commit — ” 



O KIND MASTER 



125 




“No! You and I are going back 
and you’re going to be my first- 
time-out bitch and — ” 

Seized by the shoulders, he was 
lifted and spun around. Then his 
head snapp^ back with the jar- 
ring impact of a backhand blow. 

“We don’t use that word out 
here,’’ Hobart growled. “Not un- 
less we’re mad as hell and ready 
to fight.’’ 

Keith rubbed his cheek. “Is 
she your bi — ’’ 

Whap! 

“She’s a woman,’’ snarled Ho- 
bart. “You hear that? A woman. 
But not mine. I’m too busy for 
women — I’m organizing a revolt, 
collecting animals and turning 
them into people, receiving sup- 
plies from upriver, raiding library 
ruins.’’ 

Keith made it back to his knees 
and looked at Hobart. Supplies? 
Upriver? Library ruins? 

• “Chris,’’ Laura said, “don’t 
hurt him.’’ 

Bitter was Hobart’s laugh. “I 
couldn’t hurt him any more than 
he’s already been hurt.’’ He 
turned back to Keith. “Quit grov- 
eling. Up and out of the dirt!’’ 
The Leader slipped something 
hard and shiny between his cap- 
tive’s ankles and the thongs fell 
away. 

But Keith merely whined, “I 
want my Master.’’ 

Hobart seized his arms and 
jerked him erect. 

Whap! Another mouthful of 
knuckles. 

“Well, aren’t you going to do 
something about it?’’ the Leader 
demanded. 



Keith commanded the ground 
to rise and strike Hobart with 
many projections of force stuff. 
But even his most desperate inner 
pleadings could not stir a ripple 
in the* coarse brown-black nonra- 
diance. 

“Fight, damn you!’’ Hobart 
challenge. 

Keith lunged awkwardly and 
threw a fist at his tormentor. 

Laughing, the pack l.eader eas- 
ily dodged. He raised his hand as 
if to swing but Laura stepped in 
front of him. “Please, Chris. He’s 
had enough for now.’’ 

Hobart walked off into the. 
darkness. “He struck at me, any- 
way. We may just possibly be wit- 
nessing the creation of a man.’’ 

K eith awoke to the cold pres- 
sure of obstinate ground be- 
neath his aching body. But had 
he been a Magnificent One surely 
he would have turned orange- 
green all over, for it was light- 
light at last. 

“Feeling better now that the 
darkness is gone?’’ Laura asked, 
stepping out of the nearby mound 
— “shack,” rather, Keith remem- 
bered. 

There were many other shacks. 
And many studs and bi — ^well, 
men and women, moving among 
them. 

His eyes swept the area. He 
tensed when he noticed, not too 
far off, something that might be 
a pinkway. It rose gracefully from 
the ground, climb^ until it was 
higher than a Sphere, then made 
a broad sweep and twisted around 
under itself. Beyond were other 



126 



IF 




pinkways curving up and over 
one another and sending off rib- 
bonways in all directions. 

Keith blinked. Why, they 
weren’t pinkways at all! They 
did not shimmer. They did not 
look the least bit like coral star- 
dust. Rather, they were light gray 
in color, like tho hue, of a sleeping 
Master. Oh, there 'was nothing 
out here to compare with the 
splendid structures in the City of 
Force! Here everything was drab. 
There was no radiance anywhere, 
except that from the Orb on High. 

He raised his arm's to the Ma- 
jestic Light Giver that dominated 
the measureless Blue Dome. 

“O, Great One!” he- intoned. 
“Take me back — ” 

“No, Hobart!” Laura cried. 

Too late. Whap! 

''‘'Sun, animal!” Hobart raged. 
“TAesun. Say it!” 

“Sun,” Keith conceded. 

“That’s better. I — ” 

Keith lashed out with his fist 
and felt it crunch against jawbone 
beneath the red beard. 

Hobart raised himself half off 
the ground and sat there feeling 
his chin and laughing. 

“Exit animal, enter human?” 
He sprang up, wrapped an arm 
about . Keith’s shoulders. “Nice 
going, Keith. Hungry?” 

Keith frowned down at the car- 
rying-slab that the guard placed 
before him. On it lay perhaps a 
dozen peculiar things: dull gray — 
bowls? — each the size of -a cu'pped 
hand. Rough and with small 
bumps and ridges on the outside. 
The insides were white, and in 
each lay a gray blob. 



“What kind of force-food balls 
are those?” 

“Oysters. From Lake Pont- 
chartrain, a couple of miles down 
the expressway.” Hobart tossed 
one of the blobs in his mouth, 
threw away its bowl, then offered 
a shell and oyster to Keith. 

He accepted it gingerly and 
slid the blob into his mouth. 

“Chew,” Hobart urged. 

The oyster was nasty and vul- 
gar. It tasted nothing at all like 
the delicious pellets Kind Master 
bestowed so generously whenever 
Keith performed well. He swal- 
lowed queasily. 

Hobart slapped him on the 
back. “You’ll like ’em after a 
while. Hank, as soon as he’s ready 
march him to the first overpass. 
We’re making up a library 
scrounging party and another to 
unload the magnets. He’s going 
to get the hell shocked out of 
him.” 

The Leader paused and 
searched the Blue Dome, which 
was filling with white puffs and 
more ominous dark-gray ones. 

“We may be able to give him 
the full treatment before tonight. 
Looks like it’s making up for 
some weather.” 

“Hey!” Hank was jubilant. 
“That’s a thunderstorm brew- 
mg. 

“Could be,” Hobart said hope- 
fully. “But it’s a long way off.” 

VI 

N THE WAY to the over- 
pass, Keith passed a number 
of shacks. Men and women were 




OKINDMASTER 



127 





under the overpass he found Ho- 
bart addressing a large group of 
men. “Watkins will lead a simple 
library scrounging party. Recent- 
ly he dug down to a new vault, 
found a^ lot of permabooks and 
more Armageddon reels. The 
party will pick up the stuff. The 
rest of us will unload that boat- 
load of magnets.” 

“When can we see the reels?” 
someone asked. 

“Now, Morty, you know we 
have to wait for a thunderstorm.” 
Keith studied several queer. 



nonforce-stuff things arrayed in a 
row under the overpass. Each con- 
sisted of a flat slab, waist-high, 
with a non-nonsubstance ring at 
each corner. The lower curves of 
the rings sat in the dirt, while 
their hubs supported the configu- 
rations. 

The Leader leveled a rigid fin- 
ger at Keith. “We’re taking our 
test animal along. Everybody 
keep an eye on him. Hasn’t 
learned about loyalty, yet.” 



128 



IF 




Keith leaned back against a 
cube with two curving projections 
protruding from opposite faces 
and regarded Hobart scornfully. 
What did such as Hobart know 
about loyalty? 

For no apparent reason, Hobart 
sprang upon him. Whop! This 
time it was a fist that delivered 
the blow. 

The Pack Leader loomed over 
him. “That’s a hand generator 
you propped yourself against, you 



damn fool! Just touch those 
cranks when we don’t have the 
cover of an electrical storm, and 
you’ll have a dozen Spheres 
breathing bolts down our necks!’’ 

“Look, son,” Hank said,, not 
unkindly, “that thing makes elec- 
tricity, sec?” 

Lek-tris-City? Could they build 
their own Metropolis out here? 

“The Spheres don’t like our 
electricity. Maybe they would 
have just ignored us when they 



OKINDMASTER 



129 



came and took over our world. 
But we had phased current — 
something they can’t tolerate. 
That’s why they destroyed civili- 
zation. But we’ve discovered 
something else they can’t stand. 
Magnetic force fields — ” 

“Let’s go,’’ Hobart interrupted. 
“If we run into a Sphere, just 
drop the carts and start whooping 
it up like strays.’’ 

But the Leader’s words blazed 
in Keith’s mind like the most 
vivid memory-images on a Mag- 
nificent One’s surface: Just touch 
those cranks . have a dozen 
Spheres . .. So there was a way 
to alert the Masters to this Out- 
side threat! 

Several of the men tugged on 
projections extending from each 
slap. The platforms rolled on 
their rings onto the gray express- 
way. 



T he trek was an exhausting 
ordeal. At one point Keith 
dropped down upon the grayway 
and sat there breathing heavily. 
Oh, if he could only be with Mas- 
ter, enjoying all the comforts and 
delights of the City of Force! 

There was the edge of the City 
now — so 'close that the can’t-see- 
through wall of radiant stardust 
rose high beside the grayway 
ahead. He thrust imploring hands 
towards the treasured haven, 
knowing that Kind Master was 
somewhere within all that glisten- 
ing brightness. 

So heartfelt was his yearning 
that the glittering wall grew two 
great, gyplike arms and extended 



them toward him, atremble with 
endearment. 

“Knock it off.’’ DuBois kneed 
him in the back. “On your feet. 
We don’t want to get left!’’ 

Keith pleaded with the surface 
of the grayway to bulge up into a 
wave of effort-conserving self-pro- 
pulsion. But the hard, miserable 
stuff behaved as though he were 
directing no thoughts at it. 

DuBois lifted him and they 
trudged onward. The radiant, re- 
ceptive arms that had reached out 
toward him flowed back into the 
coral barrier. 

This grayway was nothing like 
the City’s shining pinkways, Keith 
told himself. It heaved up here 
and there in broad, tilted slabs 
where stout trees were pushing up 
through it. LFgly, brown masses 
were cluttering it, ancient mounds 
with grass growing all over them. 
If you looked closely, Keith no- 
tic^, you could even see what 
once might have been four rings 
beneath each one. 

Finally they reach the “libra- 
ry.” Everywhere were great 
chunks and slabs of nonforce 
stuff, tilted crazily, strewn about, 
covered with soil, grass and trees. 

The Leader came over. “While 
Watkins’ party gets the perma- 
books and the others go unload 
the boat, you come with me. 
Something to show you.” 

Hobart clamber^ up the face 
of a huge, tilted slab. Crawling 
from treelet to treelet, they final- 
ly arrived at the top. From this 
dizzying height, Keith could see 
far along the grayway. Off to his 
right was the resplendent City of 



130 



IF 




Force, so brilliant and . magnifi- 
cent. 

He stared at Central City’s viv- 
id spires and cylinders, its sparing 
ribbonways and glistening, spark- 
ing cubes and pylons, and his 
eyes became moist. 

“Not there!” Hobart back- 
handed his shoulder and he wob- 
bled. “Here — all around us!” 

Keith stared down. They were 
in the midst of a vast field of 
broken, leaning slabs of huge, 
formless clumps of grayness, of 
crevices and chasms — all being 
swallowed by green growth. 

“Thank your Spheres for that.” 
The Pack Leader snarled. “This 
was once a beautiful city— a city 
of concrete and steel and glass, 
of people, ambitions, pride, lights 
and festivals.” 

City of man? Men never had 
cities! 

“And do you know what hap- 
pened?” Hobart raged oji, fists; 
clenched. “This is whai your 
Magnificent Spheres did to it! 
They came from — somewhere. 
Another universe, maybe. Popi^d 
through all over. And just like 
that—” he snapped his fingers — 
“they had a whole world. Of 
course, there was a little cleaning 
up to do — like smashing all of our 
cities and towns and homes.” 

The man had wound himself 
into a frenzy. “But we’re not fin- 
ished,” he shouted. “And we 
won’t live like dogs. Tonight we’ll 
shojv them that we can strike 
back!” 

Keith could hardly keep from 
laughing at such stupid arro- 
gance. 



Hobart thrust out his arm. “See 
that? That’s the Missisrippi.” 

At first Keith thought it must 
be a huge pinkway— broad and 
twisting and glittering. 

“See the boat ti^ up at whaf 
used to be a wharf?” 

Nodding, Keith supposed it was 
the “boat” thby had ^n talking 
about. Oval in shape, it lay at the 
edge of the Missi — the Missi- 
something. Approaching it over 
the rubble were carts towed by 
men. 

“Well, it’s just brought us the 
weapons we need — lodestones and 
magnetized metal. Damn it, you 
should be be^ing us to use them 
on that festering City. 

Keith wondered how he could 
stop them, whether their “genera- 
tor” thing would actually summon 
the Masters. But for some reason 
his thoughts kept going back to 
the shaggy “Reb” that had silent- 
ly performed and begged for its 
food. 

B ack in the village it was 
midlight — no, “noon,” Keith 
corrected himself — ^when Hobart 
left him with Laura and two 
guards who forced him to eat 
something called “fried fish.” 

He had been finished for some 
while when the Leader returned. 
“How’d he do this time?” 

“Kept it all down,” Laura 
boasted. 

“He may be over the hump,” 
suggested one of the guards. “Just 
a matter of getting him to admit 
he’s human.” 

Hobart smiled vaguely. “Think 
so?” He put his arm around 



O KIND MASTER 



131 




'Keith’s shoulders. “Son,” he said, 
“we’re going to let you go back to 
the City.” 

“Oh, no — you don’t mean it — 
realtyV Keith exulted. 

Whap! Grayway-hard knuckles 
backhanded his face. 

“Over the hump, eh?” Hobart 
mocked- the guard. 

“But we’ve had him only a cou- 
ple of days!” Laura’s voice car- 
ried the blue hue of Spherical 
sadness as she kneeled beside 
Keith. “The other pick-ups had 
weeks!” 

Hobart shrugged. “Our mag- 
nets are deployed all along the 
western edge of that City. They 
might be detected. So we can’t 
wait. Tonight we hit our target.” 
He glanced at Keith. “Looks like 
we’re going to be stuck with a lot 
of dumb, hopeless animals after 
all.” 

A* returning “fishing party” 
broke through the tall grass and 
its leader sprinted up to Hobart. 

“It’s the widow Wooley!” the 
woman exclaimed. “Drowned!” 

Hobart’s forehead crumpled as 
he watched two of the fisherwo- 
men carrying a third between 
them. “What happened?” 

“Fell into the. lake. Current 
washed her under the seawall.” 

The bearers laid down their 
burden nearby and Keith could 
see that the fisherwoman was still, 
very still. 

Much later, when several men 
came with “shovels” (Laura ex- 
plained the word), Keith was still 
waiting to see when the “drowned” 
woman would start moving again. 
But she remained motionless as 



they carried her to *the — “grave- 
yard.” 

He became alarmed as every- 
body gathered around and the 
Leader said soft words while the 
shovelers scooped a hole in the 
dirt. 

“Hobart, what are they doing?” 
Keith demanded. 

“Burying her.” 

“Why?” 

“So she doesn’t stink up the 
place. She’s dead.” Hobart 
laughed grimly. “She’s too still. 
Dead still. Remember?” 

Keith only stared at him. 

“It means she won’t ever move 
around or think again.” 

Certainly Hobart was having 
fun with him. “What will she do?” 
“She’ll lie there and rot. All the 
flesh will fall off her bones and 
the bones will turn to dust.” 

“But — ^what will happen to 
het'l" Keith felt that he was tread- 
ing the edge of a vast and horri- 
ble unknown. 

“Gh, Chris,” Laura said. “Go 
easy with him, please.” 

“No! The truth is what makes 
a man out of an animal.” 

By now the shovelers had 
pla<^ the drowned fisherwoman 
in the hole and were throwing 
clumps of dirt on top of her. 

Keith felt terrified, small, lost. 
“That’s death, Keithie boy,” 
Hobart rasped. “That’s what hap- 
pens to all of us eventually!” 

“To— me— too?” 

“Yes. You poor, damn simple- 
ton.” 

“But — but I’m afraid. I can’t 
believe — ” 

“Wise ' up, Keith. Throw off 

t 

IF 



132 




your degenerate ignorance. Learn 
what it means to be a man — a 
mortal man!” 

Keith reared erect in deflance. 
“You’re a liar, Hobart! This can 
happen only Outside. In the City, 
if anybody becomes too still or 
too old or too hurt, the Spheres 
simply find him a new kind Mas- 
ter.” 

Hobart laughed scornfully. “So 
you’d rather live in the City, 
dopig tricks for your food, letting 
the Spheres bre^ you when and 
to' whom they wish? Because then 
you caii go on thinking life is end- 
less?” 

Keith squared his shoulders. 
“I’d rather be bred than — dead!” 

The Leader was stumped, but 
only for a moment. “Think back, 
Keith. That wasn’t a live corpse 
we buried in the force stuff of the 
pinkway when you were with us.” 

Panic and forlorn desperation 
brought on by vast, unfolding 
truth rose once again in Keith. 
There had been Stud Murdock, too 
— so old, so hurt, so still when 
he had come out otthe black-wal- 
led box in the pound. 

Terror and helplessness ex- 
ploded into piercing convictioii. 

Too still. Forever stiH. 

Keith dropp^ to his knees and 
buried his face in his hands. 

Laura reached out to him. 

But Hobart pulled her back. 
“Poor jerk. Leave him alone. Un- 
til a few moments ago he had no 
concept of mortality. Subjectively, 
•he was immortal.” The Leader 
laughed. “A true god.” 

“And now?” Laura asked, as 
though she didn’t know. 



“And now he’s aware that 
some day he will die. An animal 
can’t realize that about itself. 
Therefore he must recognize that 
he’s a man.” 

VII 

T hey let him lie besides the 
fresh mound with its new 
cross most of the afterli — “after- 
noon.” His guards had been with- 
drawn to a resi^ctable distance. 
Only Laura remained close. 

Sometimes Keith’s eyes even 
sought out the distant spires of the 
City of Force. But he rejected bit- 
terly its false promise. 

For knowledge had been 
forced upon him. He knew now 
that the Spheres were cruel trick- 
sters, that the kind Masters were 
not kind at all. For They had lied 
to him. They had led him — and 
the other personal people — to be- 
lieve that existence was endless. 
Disillusionment brought hate for 
them. And deep fear. Fear of 
death. 

Eventually Laura came and sat 
by him, soothing his head upon 
her shoulder. Her softness and 
nearness brought comfort, some- 
how forced back the encroachment 
of fear. 

Was it possible that she could 
make him forget his certain non- 
endlessness? 

He looked into Laura’s blue 
and beautiful eyes, and he smiled 
for the first time since he had left 
the City of Force. 

Her face glowed like the surface 
of an iridescent ovoid as she 
smiled back at him. That face, he 



O KIND MASTER 



133 




saw, had all the warmth of the 
radiant carpet of shimmering star- 
dust. 

“Oh, Keith,” She pressed her 
cheek to his. “You’re going .to 
make it.” 

An immense nonSphere bolt 
lanced down in the distance and 
the sky jumbled mightily as big 
drops of water splash^ down. 

Another thunderbolt. And an- 
other. And all the while the sky 
became darker. 

Suddenly there was Hobart 
atop the overpass, shouting down 
upon the village; 

“Armageddon reels!” His 
hands were cupped about his 
mouth as the mounting wind 
tossed his beard. 

“We’re going to show Arma- 
geddon reels! On the double! 
Storm won’t last long!” 

K EITH- and Laura joined the 
rush of the villagers into the 
recess under the overpass. Hank 
raced to the hand generator and 
began whirling its cranks. 

Hobart was standing behind an 
odd cubelike object with two reels 
attached to its side and a short 
cylinder poking out of its front 
surfade. 

There was a whirring sound 
and the little cylinder hurled a 
beam of radiance. It fell upon the 
washed-out wall in a large square 
pattern. 

Keith was perplexed, for now it 
appear^ to him that the square 
was just an opening. For through 
it he could see — a City! 

Not a City of Force. Neverthe- 
less, a true City. Made up of 



many soaring forms of solid sub- 
stance. Ajnong the clumps of 
forms, there were broad grayways 
running alongside greenways of 
trees and grass. 

“Greetings,” said a deep, emo- 
tional voice. “If you are seeing 
this, our mission will have been , 
fulfilled. You will have retrieved 
the time-capsule units from the 
vaults of the New Orleans Public 
Libraiy.” ... 

Keith gasped. All along the 
grayways in that magical scene 
were shiny, sleek things of every 
color imaginable, gliding along 
on four rings. Inside were people! 

“This,” the sad voice contin- 
ued, “will be the last of the Arm- 
ageddon reels, for little time is 
left. All that remains now is for 
suicide crews- to process this film 
underground and vacuumpack 
it.” 

Laura, close behind Keith, 
whispered, “They’re memory-im- 
ages. Just like the ones we can see 
on the surfaces of the Spheres. 
Only these are images of proud 
people who lived long ago.” 

llie flickering scenes portrayed 
more towering structures,^ the 
faces and clothes and .belongings 
of fleeing human beings. 

“The Spheres are due any^ 
moment,” said the voice. “Full 
evacuation has been ordered.'” 

The square memory-image 
steadied on the wall, showing a 
pair of tall obelisklike forms stab- 
bing the sky. Fascinated, the vil- 
lagers watched scores of shimmer- 
ing motes appear in the distance, 
aglow with the boiling yellow of 
bolt-hurling readiness. 



134 



IF 




Like glaring evil eyes, the 
Spheres came and hovered over 
the soaring structures, casting 
fierce bolts in every direction. 

A great splash of blinding light . 
here, and one of the obelisks 
crumpled. Another superbolt 
there, and an elevated expressway 
lashed back upon itself, strewing 
the shiny moving things in every 
direction. The scene changed. 
Still a third bolt, and a great arch 
spanning the Mississippi col- 
lapsed into the water. 

“Cut!” Hobart shouted, yank- 
ing on something long and thin 
that extended from the hand gen- 
erator to the meniory-image hur- 
ler. 

“Cut,” acknowledged Hank, 
bringing the cranks of the genera- 
tor to an abrupt halt. 

“Storm’s over outside,” Hobart 
explained. 

T he villagers filed out of the 
recess, leaving Keith alone in 
the murkiness intensifying as 
night approached. He sat in a cor- 
ner, head almost touching his up- 
drawn knees. For the moment, 
endlessness was far from his 
mind, as was fear of the dark- 
ness that would soon engulf him. 

“Kind” Masters? “Generous” 
Globes? “Magnificent” Ones? He 
shuddered. 

Rising, he walked over to the 
hand generator. Could he make 
those gripping Armageddon 
scenes come back on the wall? 

He seized the handles and spun 
them. But he could produce no 
radiance. He cranked until he 
was exhausted. 



When he went outside, Hobart 
was giving orders to men and 
women gathered about many 
fires. 

Laura noticed Keith first and 
pointed him out to the Leader. 
They came over, together with 
Hank, and Hobart asked, “Well, 
Keith, think it all out?” 

Keith hesitated. The Leader 
clenched his fists and raged. 
“Good God, man! A human being 
is born to be free — to exercise his 
industry and initiative — to take 
his chances with success and fail- 
ure — to climb as high as luck and 
his own capability will let him. 
Why can’t you understand?” 

Keith expected either a back- 
hand or a balled fist. But he stood 
there unflinching. “I want to take 
my chances. I want to use the 
magnets.” 

“Did you hear that?” Hank ex- 
ulted. 

“Damn right I heard it!” The 
Pack Leader grinned. 

Laura hugged Keith. “You 
made it!” 

Firelight sparkled 'in her eyes 
and made her cheeks glow like 
pink — 

No! Keith reversed himself. 
There was nothing in all of ^.Radi- 
ant City to compare with the soft 
beauty of Laura. 

“I wanted to see more of those 
memory-images,” he said. “I 
turned those cranks but — ” 

Hobart gaped. “What did you 
say?” 

“The cranks — I turned and 
turned — ” 

“When?” 

“Just now.” 



0 KIND MASTER

Hobart sent his sonorous voice 
booming out over the village: 
“Attack parties deploy! The 
Spheres will be here any minute! 
Unassigned personnel take to the 
forest!” 

T he village was a blur of mo- 
tion. Men, women, children 
stumbled over one another, hurd- 
ling their fires and lunging off into 
the darkness. 

Palms upraised, Keith pleaded, 
“I — I didn’t know, Chris., I forgot 
about the — ’lectri-city.” 

“Not your fault, Keith. You 
didn’t realize — ” 

Laura screamed and pointed. 
Two brilliant motes were hurtling 
in their direction, jewels against 
the blackness of night. 

“Hank,” Hobart said, “get 
Laura out of here. Man your as- 
sault positions.” 

Dismayed, Keith watched the 
glittering motes grow to the size 
of twin suns over the forest. 

“Down!” the Leader ordered, 
pulling him to the ground. “We 
don’,t know what they’re seeing 
— or sensing. But we can’t let 
them get back to their City.” 

He took several bar magnets 
from his waist pouch and spread 
them on the ground. Keith 
reached over and grabbed a cou- 
ple. 

The fiercely glowing Spheres 
were high above the village now. 
And the drab shacks and cluster 
of overpasses and underpasses 
were bathed in their awful, men- 
acing radiance. 

Suddenly one Sphere loosened 
a superbolt. The hit sent great 



hunks of the elevated expressway 
hurtling into the night. 

The other Sphere dropped to 
just above ground level and 
drifted toward the ove^ss. 

Hobart waited until it was al- 
most upon them. Then he leaped 
up and hurled a magnet. The bar 
embedded itself in the Sphere’s 
glowing surface, whereupon the 
creature imme^tely began to 
shrink, shrink — and it was all 
gone, leaving dense darkness 
where it had b^n. 

The other Sphere swooped 
down as if to learn what had hap- 
pened. Bewilderment was be- 
trayed by the purplish cast now 
flooding its surface." 

Hobart lurched erect and 
hurled another bar. It missed. 

But Keith had sprung into ac- 
tion. His magnet thuddra into the 
Sphere’s undersurface. It dwin- 
dled to nothing. 

The Leader rained thumps on 
Keith’s back. “Today you are a 
man! 

Let’s go catch up with the as- 
sult force.” 

T he line of assault, several 
hundred abreast, had already 
pushed past the shimmering outer 
wall. Magnets, hurled ahead of 
the march, had completely sucked 
in the radiant nonsubstance, to- 
gether with the coruscating carpet 
of energy material beneath it. 

Every man and woman in the 
attack force, including Keiths, 
was weighted down by waist 
pouches filled with magnets. 

Trailing behind came the sup- 
ply carts, heaped with inore weap- 



136 



IF 




ons and tugged along by spet^l 
details. Youngsters scurried 
among the carts, retrieving mag- 
nets already hurled. The pouches 
of the' attackers were kept well- 
filled. 

It was a neatly planned opera- 
tion, Keith had to acknowledge 
as he pushed ahead. Several paces 
on his left marched Hobsirt, and 
Laura on the ri^t. Beyond them 
advanced Hank, Watson, DuBois, 
Adler and many other villagers 
Keith recognized in the radiance 
of the force-stuff structures that 
lay ahead of them. 

Having covered the area be- 
tween the outer barrier and the 
first moundhood, he looked back 
and saw that the line of attack 
had left notluAg glistening behind 
it. The magnets worked magic. He 
hurled ar bar at the nearest 
mound, even as Hobart and 
Laura and everyone else in the 
line cast, weapons at targets of 
their own choice. 

Great patches of pinkway were 
disappearing before them. Sap- 
phire mesh enclosures twisted and 
then shrank. Whole domes were 
being sucked up. And the Spheres 
within, trying to squeeze through 
the openings made by magnetic 
attraction, were drawn against the 
ends of the hungry bars and swal- 
lowed. As radiant nonsubstance 
evaporated before the attack, per- 
sonal people rose, dazed, from the 
dirt that had underlain their 
mounds and enclosures. 

Suddenly Laura screamed. 
Keith spun in her direction. One 
of the Spheres had escaped its 
ipound and was hovering above 

O KIND MASTER 



her, already yellowing with its 
bolt-hurling hue. 

He sprinted over and heaved a 
magnet. But the Magnificent 
B^ng was too high to Im within 
range. 

Shoving the girl behind him, he 
tensed as he watched the evil pow- 
er lance out. 

It would have hit him full in 
the chest. But the UghtningUke 
streak curved slightly and jabbed 
into — actually was attracted to 
his pouchful of magnets! He was 
not even singed as the bars held 
the streak frozen in midair. Grad- 
ually they sucked up the shaft of 
energy, drawing the Sphere along 
on its bolt-turned-Ieash. His 
pouch swallowed the last of the 
streak, then the now fist-sized 
creature as though in a final gulp. 

Shaking, Laura clung to him 
for a moment — until Hobart’s tri- 
umphant laughter jarred her 
erect. 

“Sorry I couldn’t get over to 
help,’’ the Leader shouted from 
his position in the line. “But I had 
an idea the magnets would do 
something like that. Now we know 
for certain. Back to your places. 
Let’s get on with it!’’ 

The attack continued, pressed 
more vigorously now that wqrd 
had been passra along the line 
and everyone knew the magnets 
also afforded protection against 
bolts. 

T hroughout the night 

Keith, glancing left and right 
while the assault swept over the 
City, saw many a Radiant Master 
drawn into a pouchful of magnets 



137 




at the end of its harmless bolt. At 
one point, scores of the things 
mounted a counterattack. But 
each eventually gave up the last 
glimmering radiance of its life to 
a pouch filled with magnets or 
to a hurled bar. 

The great moundplexes and the 
hulking cubes and pyramids, py- 
lons and cylinders of City Central 
r^uired a more intensive assault 
effort But magnets scattered at 
their bases were sufficient to be- 
gin the sucking-up process. 
Slowly the proud edifices sank, 
losing their nimbuses, their emis- 
sions of showering sparks, their 
sheets and streamers of energy. 
Special details remained behind 
to finish them off while Hobart, 
with Keith and Laura and the 
bulk of the attack force, pushed 
on to swedb the rest of the Radi- 
ant Metropolis from end to end. 

Counterattacks continued 
throughout early mornjng. Not 
until shortly before dawn did the 
few remaining Spheres realized 
the suicidal hopelessness of at- 
tempting to hurl bolfs. These 
Beings eventually fled, disappear- 
ing over the horizon. 

At the eastern edge of what had 
been the City of Force, Keith 
turned to survey the results of 
their attack. Not radiant structure 
an^here! He saw only rubble on 
which the City had stood. The as- 
sault forces rushed about, retriev- 
ing magnets and herding fright- 
ened personal people into bewil- 
dered groups. 

But not all were frightened or 
bewildered. Noticing Bitchette 
Margo in one of the groups, Keith' 



rushed over to her, tried to talk 
reassuringly. 

“Everything will be all right,” 
he told her. “You’re free now. 
Don’t be scared.” 

“Who’s scared? This is marvel- 
ous!” She clapped her hands. 
“Who needs a Master?” 

He laughed. 

“You look wonderful in those 
animal skins, Keith,” she said. 
Staring into his eyes, she added, 
“If I let you have me, will you get 
me some of them?” 

Keith laughed again, walked off 
to another group. Laura was talk- 
ing to them. 

She took his hand. “Don’t wor- 
ly, Keith. They’ll all be human- 
ize. You proved they could be.” 

He wipra grime from his face. 
“I wasn’t all that unhuman, was 
I?” 

“Not to me. I knew all 
along — ” 

Feeling like a man, he acted 
like one. He kissed her. 

“Break it up!” Hobart growled, 
signaling them to follow him. 
“Got to get a rehabilitation pro- 
gram going and move camp at the 
same time. May not be too long 
before those |uys — ” he indicated 
the direction in which the Spheres 
had retreated — ’’come back with 
their big brothers.” 

“Where are we going?” Keith 
asked. 

“After we get things under con- 
trol, we’ll split up. Send training 
units all over. There are ’stray 
packs’ operating outside many an- 
other City of Force. And every 
one of those cities is begging for 
the magnetic treatment.” #

OF

The Coming of the Dinosaurs 



Few lay persons have occasion 
for any in-depth contemplation of 
jaws— save maybe their own in 
connection with visitis to the den- 
tist. But jaws are important when 
it comes to tracing evolutionary 
lines. 

Let us begin with our own, 
specifically the lower jaw and one 
side only since the left is the mir- 
ror image of the right. It consists 
of one bone which has an upward 
bend in the rear to form a hinge 
that connects it with the upper 
part of the skull. Since the teeth 
are attached to this bone it has the 
technical and logical name of 
“dentary.” This construction is the 



,same for all mammajs,^whether 
'the jaw is that of an ape, a cat, a 
dog or even that mythical jawbone 
of an ass with which Samson killed 
a large number of probably inno- 
cent people. 

If we now look at the jaw of a- 
reptile we find that matters are 
far more complicated. There ^is a 
dentary for the teeth but it is'^iar- 
row, hence it is reenforced below 
by another bone which is called 
the “splenial.” The combined 
dentary and splenial are joined in 
the back to a bone named the 
“surangular,” which forms the 
hinge. But it, too, has its reen- 
forcement, called the “angular.” 



139 



And at the back of the angular is 
still another bone, the “articular.” 
Nobody stops anybody from think- 
ing that this is patchwork but the 
setup described is found in all rep- 
tiles, living and extinct — with, of 
course, the exceptions necessary to 
prove our point. 

These exceptions — one could 
have guessed it — occur in the Kar- 
roo fossils and provide us with our 
chance to check life’s progression. 
In Seylacosaurus {sky lax is Greek 
for ‘puppy’ ) the splenial is miss- 
ing. Angular, surangular and arti- 
cular are present and have nearly 
their normal sizes. But they have 
become superfluous because the 
dentary has not only grown heavy 
and strong — it also has developed 
the hinge part. In Cynogmthus 
(from kyon, meaning dog and 
gmthos, meaning jaw) the three 
extra bones are markedly reduced. 
In Sesamodon, one of the last the- 
riondons that survived into the 
Triassic period, they are missing. 
Sesamodon was a reptile in transi- 
tion — its nearly mammalian jaw 
shows the lines along which evolu- 
tion was running then. 

Apparently there was a line run- 
ning from these reptiles to the 
mammals but since any fossil is the 
result of several successive acci- 
dents — first the animal must get 
into a situation where its remains 
can become fossil and then the fos- 
sil must be found — ^we do not 
know all the stages that line had to 
pass through. At any event those 



reptiles that stayed reptiles — one 
might call them confirmed in their 
species — kept their complicated 
jaw construction to this day. 

But let us first discuss their pe- 
riod. 

Triassic means triple and with a 
good reason, the Triassic period 
has three clearly distinct subperi- 
ods. The oldest is usually referred 
to as “hunter” in English, ^n ab- 
breviation of the German name 
which is Buntsandstein, meaning 
colorful sandstone. The middle 
one also has a German name; 
Muschelkalk from Muschel which 
means clam and Kalk which means 
limestone. The top layer of this 
triad is called Keuper which is an 
old miner’s term for a certain kind 
of rock. The total duration of the 
Triassic period was from 33-35 
million years. The three sub- 
periods share this duration more 
or less equally, though, if you go 
by the volume of fossils, the 
Muschelkalk period, consisting of 
marine sediments in Europe, 
seems to cdme out on top. 

Originally .it was believed that 
the Tethys Sea had simply 
widened to cover western Europe. 
In the light of later knowledge of 
continental drift the explanation 
is different. The lowlands were 
flooded by the Tethys from the 
south, but by a western projection 
of the later Indian Ocean. That 
the Muschelkalk Sea had been, 
shallow had been known aH along 
— its fossils proclaimed the fact. 



140 



IF 




Life in . the ocean and its 
branches that made inroads into 
the continents that began to crack 
up just then was vari^ated. 
Practically everything one would 
expect to find in ocean was there, 
except for marine birds and mam- 
mals. The mammals that existed 
stayed on land, though they may 
have frequented rivers — the birds 
still had to evolve from^ the rep- 
tiles. 

Therefore the lughest life forms 
in the seas were reptiles and the 
triassic forms shotted what was to 
come. The earliest known marine 
turtle was found in late triassic 
deposits and sinm chelys is Greek 
for turtle it was logically named 
Triassochelys. Though the fossil 
we have is from the late Triassic, 
marine turtles must have been 
around during the earlier subperi- 
ods (the oldest tortoise-like fossil 
was discovered in the Karroo). 

Another Triassic marine reptile 
was an early form of the ichthyo- 
saurs that had the general shape of 
our porpoises. The first find of tri- 
assic ichthyosaurs was made on the 
island of Spitsbergen to the north 
of Scandinavia — its name became 
Mixosaurus nordenkjoldi. Later 
somewhat earlier forms came to 
light in California. 

A THIRD kind of jnarine rep- 
tile from the Triassic was not 
yet quite marine. It was a fairly 
large (about twenty feet from the 
tip of its snout to the tip of the 



tail) and massive saurian with a 
long neck, a big body and a medi- 
um-long tail. Its teeth show that 
it caught fish but its feet indicate 
that it was still a walker. We have 
to picture this animal, Nothosaur- 
us andriani, as a shore-dwelling 
fishing type, probably able to 
wim but still a land animal. 
Nothosaurus, found in southeast 
Germany, had a close relative in 
Lariosaurus from northern Italy. 
Both show how the ancestors of 
the plesiosaurs were not directly 
ancestral to the plesiosaurs and 
seem to have died out around the 
end of the Triassic period. 

But we are not yet done with 
the marine life forms of the Trias- 
sic. / 

Among the fisfies all the later 
types were well represented, 
since the earliest of the modern 
fishes (with a bony skeleton) exist 
since the Devonian period. A find 
from the Devonian of Scotland has 
proved that representatives of the 
crossopterygians were present, 
that group of ancient fishes that 
became so well known because of 
one — incidentally quite large — 
form that was discovered to be 
still living in the waters around 
the Comores Islands to the north 
of Madagascar. That particular 
crossopterygian can now be found, 
under Latimeria, even in chil- 
dren’s encyclopedias. 

One interesting point is that 
there were already flying fish 
during the Triassic peri<^. A fine 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



141 




specimen was recovered from late 
triassic deposits in Austria. Its 
name is Thoracopterus and though 
it seems to be an adult it is only 
four inches long. Quite probably 
Thoracopterus swam in schools 
like the flying fish of our time. 

Of course the older forms of 
fishes called elasmobranehs (the 
zoologist’s collective designation 
of sharks, rays and chimeras) were 
present in the triassic seas since 
they originated during the Devon- 
ian and Carboniferous periods. 
However, one cannot say that they 
did not fossilize well. 

The lower life forms were pre- 
sent, too. At the top of the list are 
a few ammonites, shelled relatives 
of the octopi of our time and 
vaguely represented by the living 
nautilus. Whether unshelled 
octopi like the living forms already 
existed is not known — in fact we 
do not know when they origi- 
nated. The oldest known fossil is 
Palaeoctopus, found in Lebanon in 
layers that belong to the latest 
portion of the Cretaceous period. 

That all the kinds of echino- 
derms were present can be seen 
from the following tabulation; 

crinoids (sea lilies) from 
Middle Cambrian to present; 
asteroids (sea stars) from Up- 
~ per Cambrian to present; 
echinoids (sea urchins) from 
Lower Silurian to present; 
holothurians (sea cucumbers) 
from Middle Cambrian to 
present. 

142 



Since representatives of all these 
groups are still, alive there can be 
no doubt that they lived during 
the Triassic period, though fossils 
of some (especially sea stars) are 
rare. 

Turning to the land we can ex- 
pect only three kinds of land ver- 
tebrates; amphibians, reptiles and 
mammals. The amphibians are 
subdivided into two groups which 
even the layman finds logical, 
namely tailed, amphibians (newts 
and salamanders) and tailless 
amphibians (frogs and toads.) All 
the amphibians from the Cam- 
brian period to the end of the Tri- 
assic were tailed, and one (Lysoro- 
phus) could actually be called an 
early salamander. No fossils of tail- 
less amphibians arc known from 
the Triassic; fossil frogs appear in 
late Jurassic deposits both in North 
America and in Spain, but nobody 
knows when they originated. 

We know considerably more 
about the reptiles of that period. 
In an area in western Germany 
known as the Eifel remains of a 
reptile were Tound that belongs to 
the same type as one still living 
under severe protection on some 
small islands near New Zealand. 
The living type is known as Hat- 
teria or Sphenodon, the order to 
which it belongs is that bf the 
Rhynchocephalia and we know 
that the triassic form gave rise to a 
number of marine predators that 
probably ate mollusks. They also 
produced a crocodile-like form 

IF 




{Champsosaums) that has been 
found in cretaceous deposits in 
North America. All the later forms 
are now extinct, whether still 
other post-triassic reptiles (also ex- 
tinct by now) sprang from the rhy- 
nchocephalians is now doubtful, 
though the theory was widely ac- 
cepted half a century ago. 

But triassic deposits contain re- 
mains of another early group of 
reptiles, called the pseudosuchians 
(pseudo-crocodiles, if you want) 
which was ancestral to many other 
reptiles as we shall see. The early 
pseudosuchians were small, looked 
generally like lizards and seem to 
have been tree-climbing. True 
crocodiles appear first in late Jur- 
assic layers and, as in the case of 
the tailless amphibians, one may 
believe — or not — that they go 
back to late triassic times. 

I T WAS during triassic times 
that the first true dinosaur trod 
the land and it is certain that the 
pseudosuchians were their ances- 
tors. Everybody knows that many 
dinosaurs walked on their hind 
legs only and although it seems 
logical to assume that the dino- 
saurs began their career as quad- 
rupeds, two of the best known tri- 
assic dinosaurs had a bipedal loco- 
motion. 

The inhabitants of certain areas 
of Connecticut were familiar with 
“bird tracks in stone” for decades 
before anybody said “dinosaurs” 
or talked of evolution. The Con- 



necticut yankees could tell at a 
glance that some of these “birds” 
must have been quite large. At 
any event they did ^ot live there 
any more. 

Geologists could tell that the 
rocks with the “bird tracks” were 
triassic rocks and they suspected 
that the tracks were reptilian. But 
4t took a long time before the track 
makers became known, if not “in 
the flesh” at least “in the bone.” 
The largest of them, somewhat 
bigger than the African ostrich, 
was Podokesaurus holyokensis. It 
had very small forefeet, long hind- 
Jegs with three-toed feet and a 
long tail. 

The European triassic dinosaur 
Plateosaurus longiceps was larger 
and more massive than the Ameri- 
can form. Its head must have been^ 
about ten feet above the ground 
when the animal straightened up 
to look around. It had proportion- 
ally much larger forelegs than 
Podokesaurus and when feeding 
might have assumed a four-legged 
position as kangaroos can be seen 
to do. Plateosaurus has been found 
in deposits that clearly indicate 
that it lived in a desert area. It is 
probable that the specimens we 
have, all of them from a fairly 
small area, are the remains of indi- 
viduals that perished while migrat- 
ing from a dried-up water hole in 
search of another one. 

A few fossils from the Triassic 
of California prove the presence 
at that time of still another rep-

tilian type called the Thalatto-^ 
sours {thalatta is Greek for “sea”). 
They also seem to have been shore 
dwellers like the European Notho- 
saurus but were much smaller, the 
largest Californian thalattosaur 
was between six and seven feet 
long. It is likely that it belonged to 
the ancestral group of the monitor 
“lizards” of our time. 

The mammals of the Triassic re- 
main to be' discussed — unfortun- 
ately there is not much to say. The 
earliest mammals naturally must 
have had some reptilian traits. 
One could speculate that the 
mechanism that regulates the in- 
ternal temperature of a mammal 
was not as efficient in the earliest 
mammals as it is in the late forms. 
One could also speculate that the 
earliest mammals still laid eggs 
like reptiles. But such speculations

Bodum banged the pot as he 
rinsed it out in the sink. “What 
do your newspapers want to know 
about me? Over forty years here — 
there are a lot of things I can tell 
you about.”

ple live up there? Can there be a 
whole world up there of which we 
live in total ignorance?” 



are unnecessary, it so happens that 
two types of the earliest mammals 
are still alive in Australia. Named 
platypus and echidna they show 
very nicely how the earliest mam- 
mals were built. Their blood 
temperature varies over a range 
that humans could hardly survive. 
And they do lay eggs. As if to dis- 
play early versatility, echidna is a 
dry land animal while platypus 
lives, beaverlike, in fresh water. 

Both are about a foot in length, 
the actual early mammals, as the 
rare fossils show, were much smal- 
ler, about the size-of a mouse. We 
can guess that virtually all of the 
early mammals were insect eaters; 
plants bearing small seeds did not 
yet exist as far as we know. 

The mammals had to wait for a 
round hundred million ■ years be- 
fore they came into their own. #

Bodum hesitated, frowned in 
thought before he answered. 

“I believe they have dogs up 
there.” 

“Yes,” Carter answered, ham- 
mering his fist on the window 
ledge, not knowing whether to 
smile or cry. The water fell by; the 
floor and walls shook with the 
power of it. 

“There-— more and more things 
going by.” He spoke quietly, to 
himself. v‘‘I can’t tell what they 
are. That — that could haveibeen a 
tree and that a bit of fence. The

animals, logs, anything, lliere is a 
different world above The Falls 
and in that world something ter- 
rible is happening. And we don’t 
even know about it. We don’t even 
know that world is there.” 

He struck again and again on 
the stone until his fist hurt. 

The sun shone on the water and 
he saw the change, just here and 
there at first, an altering and shift- 
ing. 

“Why— the water seems to be 
changing ' color. Pink it is — no, 
red. More and more of it. There, 
for an instant, it was all red. The 
color of blood.” 

He spun about to face the dim 
ro6m and tried to smile but his 
lips were drawn back hard from 
his teeth when he did . 

“Blood? Impossible. There can’t 
be that much blood in the whole 
world. What is happening up 
there? What is happening?” 

His scream, did not disturb Bo- 
dum, who only nodded his head in 
agreement. 

“I’ll show you something,” he 
said. “But only if you promise not 
to write about it. , People might 
laugh at me. I’ve been here over 
forty years and that is nothing to 
laugh about.” 

“My word of honor, not a word. 
Just - show me. Perhaps it has 
something to do with what is hap- 
pening.” 

Bodum took down a heavy bible 
and opened it on the table next to

the lamp. It was set in very black 
type, serious and impressive. He 
turned pages until he came to a 
piece of very ordinary paper. 

“I found this on the shore. Dur- 
ing the winter. No one had been 
here for months. It may have come 
6ver The Falls. Now I’m not say- 
ing it did — but is is possible. You 
will agree it is possible?” 

“Oh, yes — quite possible. How 
else could it have come here? 
Carter reached out and touched it. 
“I agree, ordinary paper. Torn on 
one edge, wrinkled where it was. 
wet and then dried.” He turned it 
over. ‘ “There is^ lettering on the 
other side.” 

“Yes. But it is meaningless. It is 
no word I know.” 

“Nor I, and I speak four lan- 
guages. Could it have a meaning?” 

“Impossible. A word like that.” 

“No human language.” He 
shaped his lips and spoke the let- 
ters aloud. “Aich — Eee — Ell — 
Pea.” 

“What could HELP mean,”- 
Bodum shouted, louder than ever. 
“A child scribbled' it. Meaning- 
less.” He seized the paper and 
crumpled it and threw it into the 
fire. 

“You’ll want to write a story 
about me,” he said proudly. “I have 
been here over forty years, arid if 
there is one man in the entire 
world who is an authority on The 
Falls it is me. 

“I know everything that there 
is to know abqut them.” #

for us and even more for the 
house detective. 

Leigh Couch registered us at 
the Convention desk and did the 
job so graciously that I stifled my 
initial impulse to ask the obvious 
question — Mrs. Cduch, if you 
were widowed in India, would you 
commit settee? Actually, there 
was no time for questions. The 
fans were already pouring into the 



lobby and the bartenders were 
already pouring out at the bar. 
That, of course, is the real thrill 
of convention attendance — with- 
in the space of a few minutes 
you meet more fans than you can 
shake a stick at. I know, because 
I tried. 

Soon a group assembled fbr 
dinner in the Hunt Room (so 
named because if you want a 
waitress you’ve got to hunt for 
her) and the nose-count included 
Philip Jose' Farmer, Bette Farmer, 
Samuel D. Russell, Florence 
Russell, David and Ruth Kyle, 
Judy-Lynn Benjamin, Don Ben- 
sen, my wife and myself. A total 
of eleven noses in all — there was 
one little fellow, whose face I 
never saw. Only his nose was vis- 
ible above the table top, so nat- 
urally he couldn’t eat a meal. He 
just sniffed some airplane glue 
for dessert. 

After dinner various noses got 
on the scent of room parties but 
we decided to retire early and rest 
for what lies ahead. And after 
looking over the list of speakers 
on the program I expect plenty of 
lies ahead. 

Our room seems very nice but 
lacks closet space. Also there’s 
no lock on the door and people 
keep coming in and out. From 
the way they all talk about “up” 
or “down” I suspect they must 
be on drugs. 1 may have to~ letter

D ear diary: Every eatery 
in this hotel has a name. I 
had breakfast in the. Tack Room. 
Couldn’t figure out why they 
called it that until I sat down in 
my seat. v 

I got the point. 

I breakfasted alone— for about 
ten seconds. Then I was joined 
by William Rotsler. He in turn 
was followed by one Johnson and 
two del Reys (Evelyn and Lester), 
plus James Gunn, Gordon Dick- 
son, Jack Williarnson and Ross 
Rocklynne. From the way the 
mob was surging in as I left, I 
gather this wilLbe a big affair. 

Out in the lobby I encountered 



two of my very favorite people — 
Lee Hoffman, Bea Mahaffey and - 
Bob Tucker (think about it). 

Lee, who has been writing 
science fiction and westerns, has 
just sold a book to the movies. 
Bea, formerly editor of Other 
Worlds (not to be confused with 
Udder Worlds, the Dairy Mag- 
azine) hasn’t attended a World- 
con for some time and com- 
mented on the magnitude of this 
one. Bob Tucker, whom I studi- 
ously ‘ignored, managed to steal 
my identification badge and ex- 
change it for his own. I didn’t 
realize our badges were switched 
until a" group of fans came up and 
asked for my autograph. Then 
they began stoning Tucker — a 
superfluous gesture, since he was 
already stoned. 

The Convention was to open at 
11 A. M., so we made our way 
through the halls to the main au- 
ditorium. En route I had the 
pleasure of meeting TAFF-winner 
Eddie Jones, the British artist 
who was brought over as a guest 
by the Transatlantic Fan Fund. 
This is the "voluntary subscrip- 
tion which sends an American 
fan to Europe one year and a 
European fan to the United 
States the next, as a guest of the 
Convention. I could explain how 
this is done, by nomination and 
popular vote, but I’ve already 
loused it up by neglecting to men- 
tion that in past years there was 
also a winner from/ Japan. Suf-

ficc to say that Mr. Jones was in- 
deed this year’s TAFF delegate 
and also the Fan Guest of Honor 
at the Convention — and to judge 
from our meeting, he is going to 
fill both roles admirably. 

Walking toward the auditorium 
I notfcd the huge Huskster Room 
— ^where books, magazines, art- 
work and manuscripts are dis- 
played for sale to collectors. 
Emerging from it I spotted Sam 
Moskowitz (science-fktion’s real 
answer to Tiny Tim), Alexei 
Panshin and Dr. C.L. Barrett. 
Doc, the longtime doyen of the 
annual Midwescons, was as 
genial as ever. Hoping to get 
some medical opinion, I informed 
him that I thought I was losing 
my voice. He reacted with great 
alarm but when I repeated my 
symptoms he laughed. 



“Losing your voice?” he echoed 
with obvious relief. “Had me 
worried for a moment. I thought 
you sai(f ‘vice?” 

But I did go and get a prescrip- 
tion. Not that anyone at^a Con- 
vention really needs a voice, with 
Harlan Ellison around. 

The opening session of the Con- 
vention came off as scheduled, 
complete with introductions of 
various attendees. Sure enough, 
when my name was called. Bob 
Tucker stood up. When Tucker’s 
name was called, I stood up. This 
baffled a lot of people; appar- 
ently because they didn’t think 
either of us could stand up. 

Bob Silverberg and Dick 
Lupoff delivered masterful 
speeches. Somewhere between 
syllables I found myself walking 
with Fritz Leiber, past the NFFF 
Hospitality Room to the Press 
Room, where .Chelsea Quinn 
Yarbro held sway. She sways 
very prettily. Terry Carr, Ben 
Bova and Hal Clement contin- 
ued the Convention program — 
come to think of it, they pre- 
ceded Dick Lupoff— but I 
opted for lunch. Other opters who 
opterated at my table were Jay 
Kay Klein (who vows he’ll shoot 
1000 pictures at this Convention), 
Bob Pavlat, Mary Young, John 
and Bjo Trimble. Bjo and Bruce 
Pelz are handling the Art show, 
upstairs and 1 promised to look 
in on it. Every attendee has been 
presented with a handsome port-

IF 




folio of Jack Gaughan drawings 
— once you see it you realize why 
he was chosen Guest of 'Honor. 
And there’s, more of his art up- 
stairs, along with the work of a 
score of other pros and fans. 

Somewhere along the line I 
visited with my wife (whom I 
affectionately call Mrs. Bloch) 
and then it was time to get down 
to the outdoor swimming pool 
for the Poolside Party. Here 
each of the pros was presented 
with a plastic, straw hat deco- 
rated with a red-white-and-blue 
band. The idea was to wear this 
headgear so that fans could iden- 
tify their victims. I did a little 
identifying myself — of both fans 
and pros — and encountered Andy 
Offut, Ben Solon, Anne 
McCaffrey, Jim Warren, John 
Millard, Linda Stanley, Jack 
Chalker, Dan Galouye and his 
charming family, etc. Meanwhile, 
of course. Bob Tucker was busily 
signing my name in autograph- 
books, and just to make it look 
authentic, I was busily signing 
his name on various portions of 
feminine anatomy. And every- 
one was thordughly confused. 

Ray and Joyce Fisher, co-chair- 
men of this Convention, joined 
fellow committee members in dis- 
pensing cotton candy, soft drinks 
and music from a genuine calliope 
— an old fashioned instrument 
which' baffled younger attendees; 
even the name itself was unfamil- 
iar to them, except for the last syl- 



lable. But as the music blasted 
away 1 talked to Joe Haldeman, 
Ben Bova, Harry Harrison, Ed 
Meskys, Fred Prophet, Verne 
Corriel, Larry Niven, Leigh 
- Brackett, Edmond Hamilton, 
Harlan Ellison and — according 
to the name I put down in my 
notes— somebody named Sundry 
Others. Because we were standing 
around for so long a time, I began 
to lean on several of these people, 
but never on Sundry. 

The editor of this magazine and 
his gracious spouse hosted a din- 
ner-party in yet another hotel 
eatery, together with Judy-Lynn 
Benjamin. We joined them and 
the Sifverbergs, Clifford D. 
.Simak, Doh Bensen, the Russells, 
and part of the large Budrys fam- 
ily — Algis and Mrs., to be exact. 
A pleasant gathering. In case 
anyone wants to know what the 
“dirty pros” talk about in these 
mysterious conclaves, I jotted 
down a fragment of table conver- 
sation. 

The subject then was the prev- 
alence of drug-addiction among 
the young. 

Budrys: Everybody’s turned on! 
Why, half of the bike races in this 
country are won on grass. 

Barbara Silverberg: Oh — I 

thought they used paved roads. 

Alan Nourse, M.D., hosted an 
evening gathering for Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America in a joke- 
filled room. I sneaked out of 
there to attend a First Fandom

D ear DIARY; I got my voice 
back at breakfast, listening to 
Anne McAffrey, Gene Wolf and 
Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. Then on 
to the Art Show, with Forry and 
Wendayne Ackerman. Met Jack 
Gaughan, who is a most defight- 
ful person. His wife and his moth- 
er are justly proud of his Conven- 
tion honors. The Art Show is 
quite impressive — and so are the 
artwork prices. Writers don’t com- 
mand such money. Now I know 
what they mean when they say, 
“One picture is worth a thousand 
words.” 

Star Trek may have been can- 
celed, but the artists don’t seem 
. - to know it. I counted 412 portraits 
of Leonard Nimoy — an eary sight 
meeting in Lou Tabakow’s suite, indeed. Also (believe it or not — 
where Walt Liebscher gave a and I "prefer not), a Mr. 'Spock

spending 35c for bus fare. Isaac, 
despite his championship of mod*

going to be the only angel in Hea-

Boston has selected Clifford D. 
Simak as Pro Guest of Honor 
and Harry Warner, Jr. as Fan 
Guest of Honor. Two excellent 
choi^ss — both have contributed 
so very much to science fiction 
through the years. 

The annual Burroughs Biblio- 
phile Dum-Dum was held this 
noon. The Burroughs Biblio- 
philes are fans of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs and the Dum-Dum is a 
luncheon, not just an expression 
popularized on Laugh~In. 

While this took place I visited 
with L. Sprague de Camp, Marion 
Zimmer Bradley and longtime fan 
J. Vernon Shea, with whom I’yc 
corresponded since the days when 
both of us were part of the old 
“Lovecraft circle.” Vernon and I 
circulated and picked up a few 
tidbits of information. It seems 
there’s been the usual lack of 
meaningful dialogue between the 
hotel management and the way- 
out segments of fandom, result- 
ing in a credibility gap which al- 
most escalated into open warfare. 
A victim of descent rather than 
escalation was Ruth Kyle, who 
last night was plunged by elevator 
into the hotel basement and some- 
how got locked in there for a time. 
Since the purpose of her trip was 

DIARY 



merely to get some milk for her 
kids, this came as an added bo- 
nus. 

During the auction session in 
the afternoon I had a late lunch 
with some of the German fans, 
who are over here hoping to cap- 
ture the 1970 Worldcon for 
Heidelberg. Mike Bradley joined 
me. Meanwhile,' back at the auc- 
tion, Ellison and Silverberg were 
sold to the highest bidders. This I 
can well believe, since anyone who 
bid on those two would have to be 
pretty high. 

llien on to Room 822 where 
Vonda McIntyre hosted a party. 
It’s her birthday, and among her 
guests I spott^ Jack Gaughan, 
the editor of this magazine. Chuck 
and Sally Crayne, Poul and Karen 
Anderson, Oliver Saari and Dale 
Tarr. Most of them were spotted 
when I spilled my drink. 

We had dinner, and somewhere, 
in the lobby I spoke to Andy 
Porter, Anna Wilson and Elliot 
Shorter (who is really taller). 

Time now for the Masquerade 
Ball. Prior to it, my wife met Bob 
Tucker’s wife — an occasion for 
long and mutual commiseration. 
The Masquerade, a Worldcon tra- 
dition, produced eighty-six cos- 
tumed competitors for prizes. 
After repeated parading and 
judging, the winners (according to 
my garbled-as-usual jottings) 
were: 

Karen and Astrid Anderson as 
“The Bat and the Bitten” (Most 

151

“Ottar” in full barbarian regalia; 
Bruce Pelz as . “Gertrude From

University of Chicago group 
{Best Group Award); Bertram B. 
Parker and Lawrence Ropp as 
“Caliban And Prospero” {Most

in various categories included Eric 
John Stark, Lori Canellen, John 
Stopa, Marcia Brown, William 
Kritzberg, Alan Nourse, Anne E. 
Trimbley; Lin and Noel Carter, 
with Lin as “Ming the Merciless” 
and Rick Norwood as “Charlie 
Brown” — Most Humorous Award. 

If I’ve misspelled names, omit- 
ted winners and left out categories 
it’s largely because of the last- 
mentioned award. Carried away 
by histrionic zeal, the portrayer of 

152 



Charlie Brown stumbled against 
a large rented screen behind the 
promenade platform and gouged 
a sizable dent in one corner. El- 
lison called for volunteer offerings 
to pay for damages and various 
conventioneers passed through the 
crowd and returned with approx- 
imately $432 in a matter of mo- 
ments. Dazed by the realization 
that at one time the entire atten- 
dance at a Worldcon couldn’t 
raise such a sum if everyone emp- 
tied his pockets completely, I 
missed some of. the proceedings. 
All I could think of was a way of 
luring Ellison into a quick crap 
game. But more of that later. 

Bruce Pelz’s performance as 
“Gertrude of Gormenghast” was 
outstanding — he soliloquized to a 
bird, in what 1 presume was 
Pidgin English-^and while 
Bruce’s real sex was never in 
doubt, the bird’s was artfully con- 
cealed. But the “Bat and the 
Beautiful” ' presentation lingers 
longest in my memory, for per- 
sonal reasons. Karen Anderson, 
as a black-cloaked vampire, 
menaced her white-cloaked 
daughter .in a weird pantomime 
which culminated in raising her 
arms, transforming the cloak into 
gigantic outspread bat-wings, en- 
folding her victim and drinking 
her blood. Lest this activity be 
doubted, Karen buried her 
mouth In her daughter’s neck 
and then raised it to display her 
ensanguined lips, together with 



IF 



gore which spattered the victim’s 
white attire. I know how this ef- 
fect was obtained but have sworn 
silence;, sufficient to that it 
was a stunning piece of Grand 
Guignol. And when Karen flitted 
off the platform she at once 
swooped down on me and be- 
stow^ a vampiristic kiss which 
left my own mouth bloody. 

So go report on Masquerade 
winners when you’ve just been 
bitten by a vampire! I suppose 
next year a werewolf will sbed on 
me. 



Aug. 31 

D ear DIARY: That sound 
you heard last night after the 
Masquerade was a Rock Group. 
You heard it. I was in bed with 
ear plugs. 

After breakfasting with my wife 
and assorted characters, I parti- 
cipated in a panel discussion on 
H^o Sawed ^Courtney' ^ Boat? 
with Lee Hoffman and Bob Tuck- 
er. Once the boat was sunk I got 
in on the latter portion of the 
Science Fiction Writers of Amer- 
ica Meeting. Back in the audi- 
torium, I joined the Gau^an 
family to listen to various sym- 
posia on science fiction through 
the decades — including a nostal- 
gic panel discussion by Leiber, 
del Rey, Simak and other no- 
tables. T. L. Sherred, Alexei Pan- 
shin and Harry Harrison followed. 
And then Ellison came on to de- 

DIARY 



liver a summation speech which 
was in effect a challenge to the Es- 
tablishment to recognize the pi- 
oneering vision of science fiction. 

A few words with Chuck Han- 
sen, then the auction — but now it 
was time for me to slip out to the 
nearest Chinese restaurant, kill a 
waiter and st^l his tuxedo for 
the Awards Banquet. 

I’m told 1893 people registered 
as Convention member^and that 
at least ISOO showed up as atten- 
dees. I can well believe it, Tor there 
seemed to be that many present at 
the banquet. 

My wife and I were seated at 
the head table. At first I consid- 
ered this quite an honor. Then I 
ran into ah old Navy man and he 
told me what “head” meant. But 
there we were, along with various 
members of the Convention Com- 
mittee-some of whom were sit- 
ting down for the first time in four 
days, after their hectic labors — 
plus the Guests of Honor and 
Toastmaster Ellison. 

In the course of his humorous 
remarks, Ellison reported on last 
night’s fund-raising campaign for 
the repair of the damaged screen 
and told the audience that any 
amount over and above the actual 
sum required to restore the screen 
itself would be donated to the 
Clarion College Workshop for its 
science fiction program. The au- 
dience reaction to this announce- 
ment was — to put it bluntly — 
somewhat negative. For a moment 

153 




it appeared that an additional 
amount would have to be raised 
to pay for the cost of Ellison’s 
hospitalization and funeral. But 
good humor was restored and the 
show went on. Forrest Ackerman 
presented the E.E. Evans Memor- 
ial Award^a First Fjandom 
Award was posthumously pre- 
sented to Wijly Ley. Fan Guest 
of Honor Eddie Jones delivered a 
well-received speech and Pro 
Guest of Honor Jack Gaughan 
was eloquent. Now nerves and 
bladders tightened as the time 
drew near to announce the win- 
ners of the annual Hugo Awards, 
the top honors bestowed by vote in 
the science-fiction field. 

I’m pretty sure who won these 
particular awards, because I an- 
nounced them and presented them 



to the recipients or those accept- 
ing for the absentees. Herewith, 
the Hugo Award winners for 
1968:

ner, Jr.

Then it was party time. I have 
vague memories of meeting col- 
lector Darrell Richardson, author 
Richard Wilson, Evelyn Barrett, 
and Rich Wannen. Twenty-seven 
of the people I insulted during my 
banquet remarks chased me ^wn 
the hall.^And the next thing I 
knew, it was — 

Sept, h 



D ear diary: No more meet- 
ings for me! Breakfast with 
George Clayton Johnson and as- 
sorted pros. R. A. Lafferty and 
Roy Lavender kindly, informed me 
that a business Session voted to 
change the name of the Convention, 
starting in 1973, to the North 
American Science Fiction Conven- 
tion — covering all future Conven- 
tions held in the area bounded by 
Canada on the north, Panama on 
the South, the West Indies on 
th.e east (that’s somewhat con- 
fusing) and, 1 suppose, the East 
- Indies oh the west. 

It being hye days since I’ve 
been out of this hotel, I felt it only 
natural to do a little comparison 
shopping and see how the rest of 
the world stacks tip alongside of 
the Convention cosmos. With that 







in mind I wandered across the 
street, through the park and into 
the St. Louis Zoo. 

Verdict: it’s less crowded there, 
less noisy but it smells worse. 

Back to lunch with the Kyles, 
Poul Anderson, Jock Root, Rusty- 
Hevelin, et. al. An afternoon of 
visiting — the Art Show again, 
the Huckster’s Room, the bar. I 
had a chat with Sid Coleman, 
longtime fan, and discussed the 
continuing hassle with hotel per- 
sonnel who turned away people 
with valid reservations, reportedly 
upped ra!tes and closed public 
rooms which were to have re-

mained open all night for the bene- 
fit of various insomniacs and out- 
somniacs who wanted to Do Their 
Thing. I know how diligently the 
Convention Committee has la- 
bored to preserve harmony but 
with such a large attendance the 
problems multiply. I still feel fu- 
ture Conventions must employ 
some professional organization to 
assist in preparations, just as bus- 
iness and fraternal convention 
groups do. But that’s an old story. 

A newer story, Dear Diary, is 
our dinner with Larry Niven and 
Marilyn, his bride-to-be — a quiet, 
pleasant evening interlude at a 
little restaurant down the street. 
My wife and 1 shared with them 
the inevitable nostalgia which 
seems a prelude to the final day of 
every Worldcon. You’ve seen so 
many people, so many friends, 
and now you realize that in a few 
hours they’ll be scattered to the 
four winds. 



Sept. 2. 

D ear DIARY: We’ll make it 
short and sweet. Breakfast 
with Karen Anderson, Joyce Mus- 
kat and a dozen other passersby. 



most of whom halted to say fare- 
well before proceeding to the 
checkout desk with their stolen 
towels and ashtrays. 

It’s hard to accept the fact that 
it’s really over; that upwards of 
1500 people gathered here, from 
all over the world, just to listen to 
speeches and participate in panel 
discussions, to see films and art- 
work, purchase manuscripts and 
printed matter at auctions, ap- 
plaud award-winners, enjoy a 
banquet and masquerade and 
poolside party, attend private 
parties of their own — and all in 
the name of a unique hobby. 

It’s even harder to believe that 
next year they’re going to do it all 
over again — in Heidelberg. Yes, 
Heidelberg did win the Conven- 
tion bid for 1970 and plans are to 
hold the gathering in an authentic 
German castle. Wunderbar! 

But you won’t be there. Dear 
Diary. 

In just a few moments. Dear 
Diary, I am returning to the St. 
Louis Zoo. And this time you go 
with me. 

It is my intention to drop you 
into the pit at the Reptile House 
and let the alligator swallow you. 





T he wheel turns, apparently at 
the rate of once a generation. 
I can remember subscribing to a 
raft of magazines that dealt mostly 
with series characters, such as Doc 
Savage or the Shadow. Such series 
books were a market must at one 
time. And before them had been 
the books that were obviously 
ended in such a way that the read- 
er would demand a sequel — such 
were the first Tarzan and John 
Carter books. 

Then all that passed into limbo. 
Publishers put their ears to the 
ground and heard a great stam- 
pede away from all such old-fash- 
ioned nonsense. With the acu- 
men that has always distinguished 
such groups, who listen mostly to 
each other, they realized that se- 



quels and serials finally were out. 

Now a bit more than thirty 
years later, it seems that another 
group of publishers has discovered 
a magic new way to capture read- 
ers^ — with series stories and novels 
that demand sequels. Plus ca 
change . 

One of the current series that 
looks least promising turns out to 
be almost good and certainly 
worth a look by anyone who likes 
fantasy of the weird sort. The 
Haunting of Alan Mais, by Peter 
Saxon (Berkley Medallion Books,

READING ROOM 



60d:), is listed as #3 of The Guard- 
ians. This is obviously an Ameri- 
can edition of an English series 
and the order of appearance here 
seems to be somewhat mixed up, 
if there is any order. 

The writing is surprising for this 
type of book. It’s literate and even 
deliberate at times, not at all like 
the hack style where events mean 
far more than their description. 
The characters of the Guardians — 
a group formed to fight occult evil 
for a fee rather than because 
they’re good guys — are not always 
sharp but they are a lot more real 
than might be expected. Most of 
their past is hinted at but obvious- 
ly must wait for many books for 
full development. 



Generally, it’s a rather good 
weird story. But at the end we’re 
left with problems which remind 
us that we’re mixed up in a series. 
The haunt may be settled but the 
effects on the girl linger on. And 
some of those effects are rather 
startling, demanding an answer if 
she’s to continue as part of this 
evil-fighting group. And there are 
a lot of other questions about the 
rest of the company that need at- 
tention. 

If you like weird stories and are 
willing to read them as they ap- 
pear and try to straighten out the 
order in your head as you go 
along, these books are worth their 
price. Maybe the confusion adds 
to the fun.

kets. will do. It is completely unimportant that 
Venus is a harsh, barren, uninhabited planet. 
According to the mentality of Mitchell Courtenay 
of Fowler Schocken Associates, the trick is to per- 
suade colonists to go to Venus, and once there, 
they will have to survive as best they can. One of 
the most savage and devastating attacks on mod- 
ern consumer society and the advertising agents 
who are its high priests, The Space Merchants is 
uncomfortably prophetic.

BRAIN WAVE by Poul Anderson. Imagine, some 
mysterious space force that inhibits the world’s 
intelligence. But suddenly, it’s gone and overnight 
the intellect of every living creature is trebled. 
What are the consequences of such instant genius? 
These are the problems confronting Archie Brock, 
former near moron; Peter Corinth, physicist; and 
his no-longer dumb wife. This provocative and 
absorbing book explores the ultimate problem of 
such a situation — in a world free of the difficulties 
that has plagued mankind throughout history, 
what is man to do with his time?

master pain peddler, skillful and sophisticated, 
lives in a time when reading tragic headlines no 
longer provides the necessary sensations. Into

Minner Burris, starman, whose butchered body 
was put together by aliens, a walking horror. What 
fun to mate these two and watch them wallow in 
their mutual torment. But somewhere, something 
went wrong. Discover what happens when the pup- 
pets begin to pull their own strings in this imagi- 
native, chilling book.
