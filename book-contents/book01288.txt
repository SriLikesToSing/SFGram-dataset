T heodore sturgeon, 

your Feature Editor, de- 
poses and says: 

I seize this space for my 
own and personal asons, 
writing before the events at 
the Pick-Congress in Chicago 
on Labor Day, where the 
World Science Fiction Con- 
vention has invited me to be 
Guest of Honor. Certain of 
these sentiments will be ex- 
pressed in my speech, but it 
is my great desire to unload 
them now, suffused with an- 
ticipation. 

Now I know that the most 
acceptable public posture is a 
politician’s mixture of humili- 
ty with a confident, “well, of 
course.” There is something 
mildly obscene about someone 
who publicly gloats (unless 
he’s an Asimov, and who can 
possibly be an Asimov?)... 
and a^ for humility, it’s usual- 


BY THEODORE STURGEON 


ly phoney and necessary. 

When Earl Kemp called me 
and told me his Committee 
had chosen me, I said, “I have 
waited twenty-three years for 
this pho^e call.” I repeat that 
here. I am grateful and I am 
proud, and I don’t think I am 
altogether humble. 

The Good Book says “Love 
thy neighbor as thyself.” I be- 
lieve that most people follow 
this precept. I believe further 
that most people don’t like 
themselves very much — which 
accounts for the rather fright- 
ening lack of love in the 
world. 

Low self-esteem takes a 
frightening toll. A guy who, 
at base, thinks little of his 
personal worth, meets a girl 
who thinks quite as little of 
hers. In the springtime of 
their association, the sap runs 
strong and warm, and she sud- 

5 


dcnly tells him he is a good 
dancer. He, startled, responds 
with the statement that she 
has beautiful eyes. Something 
happens then, something 
which is the surrogate of 
love: it feels like it, tastes 
and sounds like it. On <each 
other's compliments, they 
build a rosy pyramid of mu- 
tual esteem — and no one 
realizes that it is based on the 
fact that each of them has a 
low opinion of himself. 

T HIS kind of thing happens 
all the time, in many 
areas. 

There is a reason for this 
epidemic. Moral teachings 
from many sources have long 
urged us on in the pursuit of 
guilt. If you are ordered to 
take a good look at yourself, 
it’s defects you think of first. 
If ycxur friend says to you, 
“Can I be frank?” you don’t 
brace yourself for anything 
nice. 

We have, therefore, very 
largely disqualified ourselves 
from the right, and even the 
ability, to make honest self- 
appraisals, and inventory the 
good. It oays to learn this 
knack. It helps at the times 
when all the world’s agin you 
— you know the world is mis- 
taken — you know it. And it 
helps, too, when all the 
world’s on your side, when, 
for example, someone calls 
you up and asks you to be 
Guest of Honor at the World 
Science Fiction Convention. 

I know why world science 


fiction, in the person of Earl 
Kemp, called me up. It’s be- 
cause I have a great facility 
with words, an odd kind of 
detachment, and an unabashed 
way of putting them togeth- 
er. These things all put into 
one word make a thing called 
Talent. A better word for it 
is Gift. 

Now there are some people 
who are six foot six and go 
around bragging about it all 
the time. There are few things 
more foolish. I would be fool- 
ish to brag about m> gift. I 
was born with it ; I didn’t 
create it and I didn’t earn it. 
It’s this gift which is being 
hc.iored at the Convention, 
not me, and I honor it too. 
If this be humility, make the 
most of it. 

Before the Convention, I 
have one more thing to say; 
and it has to do with science 
fiction. 

We’re still trying to define 
sf, and I guess we always will. 
The reason that it’s so hard, 
in these speciali ! ng times, to 
say what sf is about is that it 
isn’t about anything — it’s 
about everything. It begins at 
the most remote horizons of 
any other form of expression 
except, possibly, poetry. As 
such, it is big enough for a 
talent — a gift — like mine. Sf 
has been the only place for 
it, and what I’m most grate- 
ful for is that sf coexisted 
with its birth and growth. 

The Gift knows where it 
wants to be. It is at home 
there. END

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

The first Podkayne was a Martian 
and a saint. The second Podkayne 
was not — precisely — either one! 

PODKAYNE 
OF MARS 


A LL my life I’ve wanted to 
go to Earth. Not to live, 
of course — just to see it. As 
everybody knows, Terra is a 
wonderful place to visit but 
not to live. Not truly suited 
to human habitation. 

Personally, V m « not con- 
vinced that the human race 
originated on Earth. I mean 
to say, how much reliance 
should you place on the evi- 
dence of a few pounds of old 
bones plus the opinions of 
anthropologists who usually 
contradict each other anyhow 
when what you are being 
asked to swallow so obviously 
flies in the face of all com- 
mon sense? 

Think it through. The sur- 
face acceleration of Terra is 

8 


clearly too great for the hu- 
man structure,* it is known to 
result in flat feet and hernias 
and heart trouble. The inci- 
dent solar radiation on Terra 
will knock down dead an un- 
protected human in an apnaz- 
ingly short time — and do you 
know of any other organism 
which has to be artificially 
protected from what is 
alleged to be its own natural 
environment in order to stay 
alive? As to Terran ecology — 
Never mind. We humans 
just couldn't have originated 
on Earth. Nor (I admit) on 
Mars, for that matter — al- 
though Mars is certainly as 
near ideal as you can find in 
this planetary system today. 
Possibly the Missing Planet 




was our first' home — even 
though I think of Mars as 
“home” and will always want 
to return to it no matter how 
far I travel in later years... 
and I intend to travel a long, 
long way. 

But I do want to visit Earth 
as a starter, not only to see 
how in the world eight billion 
people manage to live almost 
sitting in each others’ laps 
(less than half of the land 
area of Terra is even margin- 
ally habitable) but mostly to

see oceans. .. from a safe dis- 
tance. Oceans are not only 
fantastically unlikely but to 
me the very thought of them 
is terrifying. All that un- 
imaginable amount of water, 
unconfined. And so deep that 
if you fell into it, it would be 
over your head, incredible! 

But now we are going 
there! 

Perhaps I should introduce 
us. The Fries Family, I mean. 
Myself: Podkayne Fries — 
“Poddy” to my friends, and 

9 




we might as well start off be- 
ing friendly. Adolescent fe- 
male; I’m eight plus a few 
months, at a point in my de- 
velopment described by my 
Uncle Tom as “frying size 
and just short of husband 
high” — a fair enough descrip- 
tion since a female citizen of 
Mars may contract plenary 
marriage without guardian’s 
waiver on her ninth birthday, 
and I stand 157 centimeters 
tall in my bare feet and mass 
49 kilograms. “Five feet tWo 
and eyes of blue” my Daddy 
calls me, but he is a historian 
and romantic. But I am not 
romantic and would not con- 
sider even a limited marriage 
on my ninth birthday ; I have 
other plans. 

Not that I am opposed to 
marriage in due time, nor do 
I expect to have any trouble 
snagging the male of my 
choice. In these, memoirs I 
shall be . frank rather than 
modest because they will not 
be published until I am old 
and famous, and I will cer- 
tainly revise them before 
then. In the meantime I am 
taking the precaution of writ- 
ing Anglish in Martian Old- 
script — a combination which 
I’m sure Daddy could puzzle 
out, only he wouldn’t do such 
a thing unless I invited him 
to. Daddy is a dear and does 
not snoopervize me. My 
brother Clark would pry, but 
he regards Anglish as a dead 
language and would never 


bother his head with Qld- 
script anyhow* 

VjERHAPS you have seen a 
* book titled : Eleven Years 
Old: the Pre-Adolescent Ad- 
justment Crisis in the Male, 
I read it, hoping that it would 
help me to cope with my 
brother. Clark is just six, but 
the “Eleven Years” referred 
to in that title are Terran 
years because it Was written 
on Earth. If you will apply 
the conversion factor of 
1.8808 to attain real years, 
you will see that my brother 
is exactly eleven of those un- 
dersized Earth years old. 

That book did not help me 
much. It talks about “cushion- 
ing the transition into the so- 
cial group” — but there is no 
present indication that Clark 
ever intends to join the hu- 
man race. He is more likely to 
devise a way to blow up the 
universe just to hear the bang. 
Since I am responsible for 
him much of the time and 
since he has an I.Q. of 160 
while mine is only 145,' you 
can readily see that I need all 
the advantage that greater age 
and maturity can give me. At 
present my standing rule with 
him is: Keep your guard up 
and never offer hostages. 

Back to me. I’m colonial 
mongrel in ancestry, but the 
Swedish part is dominant in 
my looks, with Polynesian 
and Asiatic fractions adding 
no more than a not-unpleasing

is forty-eight centimeters and 
my chest is ninety-r-not all of 
which is rib cage, I assure 
you, even thqugh we old colo-

sides that, my hair is pale

ty. Not beautiful. Praxiteles 
would not have given me a 
second look. But real beauty 
is likely to scare a man off, or 
else make him quite unman- 
ageable, whereas prettiness, 
properly handled, is an asset. 

Up till a couple of years 
ago I used to regret not being 
male (in view of my ambi- 
tions), but I at last realized 
how silly I was being. One 
might as well wish for wings.

I T is because Mother is of- 
ten away from home for 
professional reasons that I 
am, from time to time, the re- 
luctant custodian of my 
younger brother. Still, I sup- 
pose it is good practice, for 
how can I ever expect to com- 
mand my own ship if I can’t 

11 



tame a six-year-old savage? 
Mother says that a boss who 
is forced to part a man’s hair 
with a wrench has failed at 
some point, so I try to con- 
trol our junior nihilist with- 
out resorting to force. Be- 
sides, using force on Clark is 
very chancy. He masses as 
much as I do, and he fights 
dirty. 

It was the job Mother did 
on Deimos that accounts for 
Clark and myself. Mother was 
determined to meet her con- 
struction dates; and Daddy, 
on leave from Ares U. with a 
Guggenheim grant, was even 
more frantically determined 
to save every scrap of the an- 
cient ‘Martian artifacts no 
matter how much it delayed 
construction. This threw them 
into such intimate and bitter 
conflict that they got married 
and for a while Mother had 
babies. 

Daddy and Mother are Jack 
Spratt and his wife. He is in- 
terested in everything that 
has already happened, she is 
interested only in what is go- 
ing to happen, especially if 
she herself is making it hap- 
pen. ' Daddy’s title is Van 
Loon Professor of Terrestrial 
History, but his real love is 
Martian history, especially if 
it happened fifty million 
years ago. But do not think 
that Daddy is a cloistered don 
given only to contemplation 
and study. When he was even 
younger than I am now, he 

12 


lost an arm one chilly night 
in the attack on the Company 
Offices during the Revolu- 
tion — and he can still shoot 
straight and fast with the 
hand he has left. 

The rest of our family is 
Great Uncle Tom, Daddy’s 
father’s brother. Uncle Tom is 
a parasite. So he says. It is 
true that you don’t see him 
work much, but he was an old 
man before I was born. He is 
a Revolutionary veteran, same 
as Daddy, and is a Past Grand 
Commander of the Martian 
Legion and a S e n a t o r-at- 
Large of the Republic, but he 
doesn’t seem to spend much 
time on either sort of politics, 
Legion or public. Instead he 
hangs out at the Elks Club 
and plays pinochle with other 
relics of the past. Uncle Tom 
is really my closest relative, 
for he isn’t as intense as my 
parents, nor as busy, and will 
always take time to talk with 
me. Furthermore he has a 
streak of Original Sin which 
makes him sympathetic to my 
problems. He says that I have 
such a streak, too, much wider 
than his. Concerning this I 
reserve my opinion. 

That’s our family and we 
are all going to Earth. Wups! 
*1 left out three — the infants. 
But they hardly count now 
and it is easy to forget them. 
When Daddy and Mother got 
married, the PEG board— 
Population, Ecology & Genet- 
ics — pegged them at five and 

by Robert A. Heinlein 



would have allowed them sev- 
en had they requested it, for, 
as you may have gathered, my 
parents are rather high-grade 
citizens even among planetary 
colonials all of whom are de- 
scended from, or are them- 
selves, highly selected and 
drastically screened stock. 

But Mother told the Board 
that five was all that she had 
time for. Then she had us as 
fast as possible, while fidget- 
ing at a desk job in the Bu- 
reau of Planetary Engineer- 
ing. Then she popped her 
babies into deep-freeze as fast 
as she had them, all but me, 
since I was the first. Clark 
spent two years at constant 
entropy, else he would be al- 
most as old as I am. (Deep- 
freeze time doesn’t count, of 
course, and his official birth- 
day is the day he was decant- 
ed.) I remember how jealous I 
was. Mother was just back 
from conditioning Juno and it 
didn’t Seem fair to me that 
she would immediately start 
raising a baby. 

Uncle Tom talked me out of 
that, with a lot of lap sitting, 
and I am no longer jealous of 
Clark — merely wary. 

S O we’ve got Gamma, Delta, 
and Epsilon in the sub- 
basement of the creche at 
Marsopolis, and we’ll uncork 
and name at least one of them 
as soon as we get back from 
Earth. Mother is thinking of 
revivifying Gamma and Epsi- 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


Ion together and raising them 
as twins (they’re girls) and 
then launch Delta, who is a 
boy, as soon as the girls are 
housebroken. Daddy says that 
is not fair, because Delta is 
entitled to be older than Epsi- 
lon by natural priority of 
birth date. Mother says that is 
mere worship of precedent 
and that she does wish Daddy 
would learn to leave his rev- 
erence for the past on the 
campus when he comes home 
in the evening. 

Daddy says that Mother has 
no sentimental feelings — and 
Mother says she certainly 
hopes not, at least with any 
problem requiring rational 
a n a 1 y s i s — and Daddy says 
let’s be rational, then . twin 
older sisters would either 
break a boy’s spirit or else 
spoil him rotten. 

Mother says that is unsci- 
entific and unfounded. Daddy 
says that Mother merely wants 
to get two chores out of the 
way at once — w hereupon 
Mother heartily agrees and 
demands to know why proved 
production engineering prin- 
ciples should not be applied 
to domestic economy? 

Daddy doesn’t answer this. 
Instead he remarks thought- 
fully that he must admit that 
two little girls dressed just 
alike would be kind of cute. 
name them “Margret” and 
“Marguerite” and call them 
“Peg” and “Meg”— 

Clark muttered to me, 

13 



“Why uncork them at all? 
Why not just sneak down 
some night and open the 
valves and call it an acci- 
dent ?" 

I told him to go wash out 
his mouth with prussic acid 
and not let Daddy hear him 
talk that way. Daddy would 
have walloped him properly. 
Daddy, although a historian, 
is devoted to the latest, 
most progressive theories of 
child psychology and applies 
them by canalizing the cor- 
tex through pain associ- 
ation whenever he really 
wants to ensure that a lesson 
will not be forgotten. As he 
puts it so neatly: “Spare the 
rod and spoil the child/' 

I canalize most readily and 
learned very early indeed how 
to predict and avoid incidents 
which would result in Dad- 
dy's applying his theories and 
his hand. But in Clark's case 
it is almost necessary to use a 
club simply to gain his divid- 
ed attention. 

So it is now clearly evident 
that we are going to have twin 
baby sisters. But it is no head- 
ache of mine, I am happy to 
say, for Clark is quite enough 
maturing trauma for one girl's 
adolescence. By the time the 
twins are a current problem I 
expect to be long gone. 

Interlude 

H I, Pod. 

So you think I can’t 
read your worm tracks. 


A lot you know about me! 
Poddy — oh, excuse me, “Cap- 
tain" Podkayne Fries, I mean, 
the famous Space Explorer 
and Master of Men — Captain 
Poddy dear, you probably will 
never read this because it 
wouldn't occur to you that I 
not only would break your 
“code" but also write com- 
ments in the big, wide mar- 
gins you leave. 

Just for the record, Sister 
dear, I read Old Anglish just 
as readily as I do System 
Ortho. Anglish isn't all that 
hard. I learned it as soon as 
I found out that a lot of books 
I wanted to read had never 
been translated. But it doesn't 
pay to tell everything you 
know, or somebody comes 
along and tells you to stop do- 
ing whatever it is you are do- 
ing. Probably your older sis- 
ter. 

But imagine calling a 
straight substitution a 
“code"! Poddy, if you had ac- 
tually been able to write Old 
Martian, it would have taken 
me quite a lot longer. But you 
can't. Shucks, even Dad can't 
write it without stewing over 
it and he probably knows 
more about Old Martian than 
anyone else in the Solar Sys- 
tem. 

B,ut you won't crack my 
code — because I haven't any.

der ultra-violet light — a sun

H, Unspeakables ! 

Dirty ears! Hangnails! 
Snel-frockey ! Spit! 

WE AREN’T GOING ! 

At first I thought that my 
brother Clark had managed 
one of his more charlatanous 
machinations of malevolent 
legerdemain. But fortunately 
(the only fortunate thing 
about the whole miserable 
mess) I soon perceived that it 
was impossible for him to be 
in fact guilty no matter what 
devious subversions roil his 
id. Unless he has managed to 
invent and build in secret a 
time machine, which I mis- 
doubt he would do if he could 
. .nor am I prepared to offer 
odds that he can’t. Not since 
the time he rewired the de- 
livery robot so that it would 
serve him midnight snacks 
and charge them to my code 
number without (so far as 
anyone could ever prove) dis- 
turbing the company’s seal on 
the control box. 

We’ll never know how he 
did that one, because despite 
the fact that the company of- 
fered to Forgive All and pay a 
cash bonus to boot if only he 
would please tell them how 
he managed to beat their un- 
beatable seal — despite this, 
Clark just looked blank and 
would not talk. That left 
only circumstantial evidence. 
I.e., it was clearly evident to 
anyone who knew us both 


(Daddy and Mother, namely) 
that I would never order can- 
dy-stripe ice cream smothered 
in hollandaise sauce, or — no, I 
can’t go on; I feel ill. Where- 
as Clark is widely known to 
eat anything which does not 
eat him first. 

Even this clinching psycho- 
logical evidence would never 
have convinced the company's 
adjuster had not their own 
records proved that two of 
these obscene feasts had taken 
place while I was a house 
guest of friends in Syrtis Ma- 
jor, a thousand kilometers 
away. Never mind. I simply 
want to warn all girls not to 
have a Mad Genius for a baby 
brother. Pick instead a stupid, 
stolid, slightly subnormal one 
who will sit quietly in front 
of the solly box, mouth agape 
at cowboy classics, and never 
wonder what makes the pretty 
images. 

But I have wandered far 
from my tragic tale. 

We aren’t going to have 
twins. 

We already have triplets. 

Gamma, Delta and Epsilon, 
throughout all my former life 
mere topics of conversation, 
are now Grace, Duncan and 
Elspeth in all too solid flesh 
— unless Daddy again changes 
his mind before final regis- 
tration ; they’ve had three sets 
of names already. But what’s 
in a name? — they are here, al- 
ready in our home with a nur- 
sery room sealed on to shelter

them... three helpless unfin- 
ished humans about canal- 
worm pink in color and no 
features worthy of the name. 
Their limbs squirm aimlessly, 
their eyes don’t track and a 
faint, queasy odor of sour 
milk permeates every room 
even when they are freshly 
bathed. Appalling sounds 
come from one end of each — 
in which they heterodyne 
each other — and even more 
appalling conditions prevail 
at the other ends. (I’ve vet to 
find all three of them dry at 
the same time.) 

A ND yet there is something 
decidedly engaging about 
the little things. Were it not 
that they are the proximate 
cause of my tragedy I could 
easily grow quite fond of 
them. I’m sure Duncan is be- 
ginning to recognize me al- 
ready. 

But, if I am beginning to be 
reconciled to their presence, 
Mother’s state can only be de- 
scribed as atavistically mater- 
nal. Her professional journals 
pile up unread, she has that 
soft Madonna look in her 
eyes and she seems somehow 
both shorter and wider than 
she did a week ago. 

First consequence : she 

won’t even discuss going to 
Earth, with or without the 
triolets. 

Second consequence: Daddy 
won’t go if she won’t go — he 
spoke quite sharply to Clark 

li 


for even suggesting it. 

Third consequence : since 
they won’t go, we can’t go. 
Clark and me, I mean. It is 
conceivably possible that I 
might have been permitted to 
travel alone (since Daddy 
agrees that I am now a “young 
adult” in maturity and judg- 
ment even though my ninth 
birthday lies still some 
months in the future), but the 
question is formal and with- 
out content since I am not 
considered quite old enough 
to accept full responsible con- 
trol of my brother with both 
my parents some millions of 
kilometers away (nor am I 
sure that I would wish to, un- 
less armed with something at 
least as convincing as a morn- 
ing star) and Daddy is so dis- 
mayingly fair with us that he 
would not even discuss per- 
mitting one of us to go and 
not the other when both of us 
had been promised the trip. 

Fairness is a priceless vir- 
tue in a parent — but just at 
the moment I could stand be- 
ing spoiled and favored in- 
stead. 

But the above is why I am 
sure that Clark does not have 
a time machine concealed in 
his wardrobe. This incredible 
contretemps, this idiot’s 
dream of interlocking mis- 
haps, is as much to his disad- 
vantage as it is to mine. 

How did it happen? Gather 
ye round. Little did we dream 
that, when the question of a 

by Robert A. Hoinlein 



family trip to Earth was be- 
ing planned in our household 
more than a month ago, this 
disaster was already complete 
and simply waiting the most 
hideous moment to unveil it- 
self. The facts are these: the 
creche at Marsopolis has thou- 
sands of new-born babies mar- 
belized at just short of abso- 
lute zero, waiting in perfect 
safety until their respective 
parents are ready for them. It 
is said, and I believe it, that a 
direct hit with a nuclear bomb 
would not hurt the consigned 
infants. A thousand years lat- 
er a rescue squad could bur- 
row down and find that auto- 
matic, self-maintaining ma- 
chinery had not permitted the 
tank temperatures to vary a 
hundredth of a degree. 

In consequence, we 
Marsmen (not “Martians,” 
please ! — Martians are a non- 
human race, now almost ex- 
tinct) — Marsmen tend to mar- 
ry early, have a full quota of 
babies quickly, then rear them 
later, as money and time per- 
mit. It reconciles that dis- 
crepancy, so increasingly and 
glaringly evident ever since 
the Terran Industrial Revolu- 
tion, between the best bio- 
logical age for having chil- 
dren and the best social age 
for supporting and rearing 
them. ; 

A couple named Breeze did 
just that, some ten years ago. 
They married on her ninth 

birthday and just past his

tenth, while he was still a 
pilot cadet and she was at- 
tending Ares U. They applied 
for three babies, were pegged 
accordingly and got them all 
out of the way while they 
were both finishing school. 
Very sensible. 

The years roll past, he as a 
pilot and later as master, she 
as a finance clerk in his ship 
and later as purser — a happy 
life. The spacelines like such 
an arrangement. 'Married cou- 
ples spacing together mean a 
taut, happy ship. 

Captain and Mrs. Breeze 
serve their ten-and-a-half 
(twenty Terran) years and 
put in for half-pay retirement, 
have it confirmed — and imme- 
diately radio the creche to un- 
cork their babies, all three of 
them. 

The radio order is received, 
relayed back for confirma- 
tion; the creche accepts it. 

Five weeks later the happy

couple pick up three babies, 
sign for them and start the 
second half of a perfect life. 
So they thought — 

But what they had deposit- 
ed was two boys and a girl. 
What they got was two girls 
and a boy. Ours. 

B elieve this you must — it 
took them the better part 
of a week to notice it. I will 
readily concede that the dif- 
ference between a brand-new 
boy baby and a brand-new girl 
baby is almost irrelevant. Nev- 
ertheless there is a difference. 
Apparently it was a case of 
too much help. Between a 
mother, a mother-in-law, a 
temporary nurse and a helpful 
neighbor, and much running 
in and out, it seems unlikely 
that any one person bathed all 
three babies as one continuous 
operation that first week. Cer- 
tainly Mrs. Breeze had not 
done so — until the day she did 
...and noticed. .and fainted 
— and dropped one of our 
babies in the bath water, 
where it would have drowned 
had not her scream fetched 
both her husband and the 
neighbor lady. 

So we suddenly had month- 
old triplets. 

The lawyer man from the 
creche was very vague about 
how it happened. He obvious- 
ly did not want to discuss how 
their “foolproof” identifica- 
tion system could result in 
such a mix-up. So I don’t 


know myself. But it seems 
logically certain that, for all 
their serial numbers, babies’ 
footprints, record machines, 
et cetera, there is some point 
in the system where one clerk 
read aloud “Breeze” from the 
radioed order and another 
clerk checked a file, then 
punched “Fries” into a ma- 
chine that did the rest. 

But the fixer man did not 
say. He was simply achingly 
anxious to get Mother and 
Daddy to settle out of court — 
accept a check and sign a re- 
lease under which they agreed 
not to publicize the error. 

They settled for three years 
of Mother’s established pro- 
fessional earning power while 
the little fixer man gulped 
and looked relieved. 

But nobody offered to pay 
me for the mayhem that had 
been committed on my life, 
my hopes and my ambitions. 

Clark did offer a suggestion 
that was almost a sensible one, 
for him. He proposed that we 
swap even with the Breezes. 
Let them keep the warm ones, 
we would keep the cold ones. 
Ever •/hod" happy — and we all 
go to Earth. 

My brother is far too self- 
centered to realize it, but the 
Angel of Death brushed him 
with its wings at that point. 
Daddy is a truly noble soul. 
but he had had almost more 
than he could stand. 

And so have I. I had expect- 
ed today to be actually on my

way to Earth, my first space 
trip farther than Phobos — 
which was merely a school 
field trip, our “Class Honey- 
moon/' A nothing thing. 

Instead, guess what I'm do- 
ing. 

Do you have any idea how 
many times a day three babies 
have to be changed? 

Ill 

H OLD it ! Stop the ma- 
chines! Wipe the tapes! 
Cancel all bulletins — 

WE ARE GOING TO 
EARTH AFTER ALL! 

Well, not all of us. Daddy 
and Mother aren't going, and 
of course the triplets are not. 
But — Never mind ; I had bet- 
ter tell it in order. 

Yesterday things just got to 
be Too Much. I had changed 
them in rotation, only to find 
as I got the third one dry and 
fresh that number one again 
needed service. I had been 
thinking sadly that just about 
that moment I should have 
been entering the dining sa- 
loon of S.S. Wanderlust to the 
strains of soft music. Perhaps 
on the arm of one of the of- 
ficers. .perhaps even on the 
arm of the Captain himself 
had I the chance to arrange an 
Accidental Happy Encounter, 
then make judicious use of my 
“puzzled kitten" expression. 

And, as I reached that point 
in my melancholy day dream, 
it was then that I discovered 
that my chores had started all 


over again. I thought of the 
Augean Stables and suddenly 
it was just Too Much and my 
eyes got blurry with tears. 

Mother came in at that 
point and I asked if I could 
please have a couple of hours 
of recess? 

She answered, “Why, cer- 
tainly, dear," and didn't even 
glance at me. I'm sure that 
she didn't notice that I was 
crying. She was already do- 
ing over, quite unnecessarily, 
the one that I had just done. 
She had been tied up on the 
phone, telling someone firm- 
ly that, while it was true as 
reported that she was not 
leaving Mars, nevertheless 
she would not now accept an- 
other commission even as a 
consultant. No doubt being 
away from the infants for all 
of ten minutes had made her 
uneasy, so she just had to get 
her hands on one of them. 

Mother's behavior has been 
utterly unbelievable. Her cor- 
tex has tripped out of circuit 
and her primitive instincts are 
in full charge. She reminds 
me of a cat we had when I was 
a little girl — Miss Polka Dot 
Ma'am— and her first litter of 
kittens. Miss Pokie loved and 
trusted all of us, except about 
kittens. If we touched one of 
them, she was uneasy about it. 
If a kitten was taken out of 
her box and placed on the 
floor to be admired, she her- 
self would hop out, grab the 
kitten in her teeth and imme-

diately return it to the box, 
with an indignant waggle to 
her seat that showed all too 
plainly what she thought of 
irresponsible people who 
didn't know how to handle 
babies. 

Mother is just like that 
now. She accepts my help 
simply because there is too 
much for her to do alone. But 
she doesn't really believe that 
I can even pick up a baby 
without close supervision. 

So I left and followed my 
own blind instincts, which 
told me to go look up Uncle 
Tom. 

I found him at the Elks 
Club, which was reasonably 
certain at that time of day, 
but I had to wait in the ladies' 
lounge until he came out of 
the card room. Which he did 
in about ten minutes, counting 
a wad of money as he came. 
“Sorry to make you wait,” he 
said, “but I was teaching a 
fellow citizen about the un- 
certainties in the laws of 
chance and I had to stay long 
enough to collect the tuition. 
How marches it, Podkayne 
mavourneen?” 

I tried to tell him and got 
all choked up, so he walked 
me to the park under the city 
hall and sat me on a bench and 
bought us both packages of 
Choklatpops and I ate mine 
and most of his and watched 
the stars on the ceiling and 
told him all about it and felt 
better. 

2Q 


H E patted my hand. “Cheer 
up, flicka. Always re- 
member that when things 
seem darkest they usually get 
considerably worse.” He took 
his phone out of a pocket and 
made a call. Presently he said, 
“Never mind the protocol rou- 
tine, Miss. This is Senator 
Fries. I want the Director.” 
Then he added in a moment, 
“Hymie? Tom Fries here. 
How’s Judith? Good, good... 
Hymie, I just called to tell 
you that I’m coming over to 
stuff you into one of your 
own liquid helium tanks. Oh, 
say about fourteen or a few 
minutes after. That’ll give you 
time to get out of town. 
Clearing.” He pocketed his 
phone. “Let’s get some lunch. 
Never commit suicide on an 
empty stomach, my dear. It’s 
bad for the digestion.” 

Uncle Tom took me to the 
Pioneers Club where I have 
been only once before and 
which is even more impressive 
than I had recalled. It has real 
waiters ... men so old that 
they might have been pioneers 
themselves, unless they met 
the first ship. Everybody 
fussed over Uncle Tom and he 
called them all by their first 
names and they all called him 
“Tom” but made it sound like 
“Your Majesty” and the mas- 
ter of the hostel came over 
and prepared my sweet him- 
self with about six other peo- 
ple standing around to hand 
him things, like a famous sur-

ge on operating against the 
swift onrush of death. 

Presently Uncle Tom 
belched behind his napkin and 
I thanked everybody as we 
left, while wishing that I had 
had the forethought to wear 
my unsuitable gown that 
Mother won’t let me wear un- 
til I’m nine and almost made 
me take back. One doesn’t get 
to the Pioneers Club every 
day. 

V/e took the James Joyce 
Fogarty Express Tunnel and 
Uncle Tom sat down the 
whole way. So I had to sit, 
too, although it makes me 
restless; I prefer to walk in 
the direction a tunnel is mov- 
ing and get there a bit soon- 
er. But Uncle Tom says that 
he gets plenty of exercise 
watching other people work 
themselves to death. 

I didn’t really realize that 
we were going to the Marso- 
polis Creche until we were 
there, so bemused had I been 
earlier with my own tumultu- 
ous emotions. But when we 
were there and facing a sign 
reading: OFFICE OF THE 
DIRECTOR — PLEASE 
USE OTHER DOOR, Uncle 
Tom said, “Hang around 
somewhere; I’ll need you lat- 
er.” and went on in. 

The waiting room was 
crowded and the only maga- 
zines not in use were Kiddie 
Ka ners and Modern Home- 
maker , so I wandered around 
a bit and presently found a 


corridor that led to the Nurs- 
ery. 

The sign on the door said 
that visiting hours were from 
16 to 18.60. Furthermore it 
was locked, so I moved on and 
found another door which 
seemed much more promising. 
It was marked: POSITIVE- 
LY NO ADMITTANCE— but 
it didn’t say “This Means 
You “ and it wasn’t locked, so 
I went in. 

You never saw so many 
babies in your whole life! 

Row upon row upon row, 
each in its own little trans- 
parent cubicle. I could really 
see only the row nearest me, 
all of which seemed to be 
about the same age — and .much 
more finished than the three 
we had at home. Little brown 
dumplings, they were, cute as 
puppies. Most of them were 
asleep, some were awake and 
kicking and cooing and grab- 
bing at dangle toys that were 
just in reach. If there had not 
been a sheet of glass between 
me and them I would have 
grabbed me a double armful of 
babies. 

T 'HERE were a lot of girls 
in the room, too— well, 
young women, really. Each of 
them seemed to be busy with 
a baby and they didn’t notice 
me. But shortly one of the 
babies nearest me started to 
cry, whereupon a light came 
on over its cubicle and one of 
the nurse girls hurried over.

slid back the cover, picked it 
up and started patting its bot- 
tom. It stopped crying. 

“Wet?” I inquired. 

She looked up, saw me. “Oh, 
no, the machines take care of 
that. Just lonely, so I’m lov- 
ing it.” Her voice came 
through clearly in spite of the 
glass — a hear & speak circuit, 
no doubt, although the pick- 
ups were not in evidence. She 
made soft noises to the baby, 
then added, “Are you a new 
employee? You seem to be 
lost.” 

“Oh, no,” I said hastily, 
“I’m not an employee. I 
just—” 

“Then you don’t belong 
here, not at this hour. Un- 
less — ” she looked at me 
rather skeptically — “just pos- 
sibly you are looking for the 
instruction class for young 
mothers?” 

“Oh, no, no! Not yet.” Then 
I added still more hastily, 
“I’m a guest of the Director.” 

Well, it wasn’t a fib. Not 
quite. I was a guest of a guest 
of the Director, one who was 
with him by appointment. The 
relationship was certainly 
concatenative, if not equiva- 
lent. 

It seemed to reassure her. 
She asked, “Just what did you 
want?” 

“Uh, just information. I’m 
making a sort of a survey. 
What goes on in this room?” 

“These are age six-month 
withdrawal contracts,” she 


told me. “All these babies will 
be going home in a few days.” 
She put the baby, quiet now, 
back into its private room, 
adjusted a nursing nipple for 
it, made some other sort of ad- 
justments on the outside of 
the cubicle so that the pad- 
ding inside sort of humped 
up and held the baby steady 
against the milk supply, then 
closed the top, moved on a 
few meters and picked up an- 
other baby. 

“Personally,” she added, “I 
think the age six-months con- 
tract is the best one. A child 
twelve months old is old 
enough to notice the transi- 
tion. But these aren’t. They 
don’t care who comes along 
and pets them when they 
cry... but nevertheless six 
months is long enough to get 
a, baby well started and take 
the worst of the load off the 
mother. We know how, we’re 
used to it, we stand our 
watches in rotation so that we 
are never exhausted from be- 
ing ‘up with the baby all 
night’... and in consequence 
we aren’t short tempered and 
we never yell at them. And 
don’t think for a minute that 
a baby doesn’t understand a 
cross tone of voice simply be- 
cause he can’t talk yet. He 
knows! And it can start him 
off so twisted that he may 
take it out on somebody else, 
years and years later. There, 
there, honey,” she went on but 
not to me, “feel better now? 


22

Feeling sleepy, huh? Now you 
just hold still and Martha will 
keep her hand on you until 
you are fast asleep.” 

She watched the baby for a 
moment longer, then with- 
drew her hand, closed the box 
and hurried on to where an- 
other light was burning. “A 
baby has no sense of time,” 
she added as she removed a 
squalling lump of fury from 
its crib. “When it needs love, 
it needs it right now. It can’t 
know that — ” An older woman 
had come up behind her. “Yes, 
Nurse?” 

“Who is this you’re chat- 
ting with? You know the 
rules.” 

“But... she’s a guest of the 
Director.” 

The older woman looked at 
me with a stern no-nonsense 
look. “The Director sent you 
in lyjre?” 

I was making a split-second 
choice among three non-re- 
sponsive answers when I was 
saved by Fate. A soft voice 
coming from everywhere at 
once announced: “Miss Pod- 
kayne Fries is requested to 
come to the office of the 
Director. Miss Podkayne 
Fries, please come to the of- 
fice of the Director.” 

I tilted my nose in the air 
and said with dignity, “That 
is I. Nurse, will you be so 
kind as to phone the Director 
and tell him that Miss Fries 
is on her way?” I exited with 
deliberate haste. 


T HE Director’s office was 
four times as big and six- 
teen times as impressive as 
the principal’s office at 
school. The Director was 
short. He had a dark brown 
skin and a gray goatee and a 
harried expression. In addi- 
tion to him and to Uncle Tom, 
of course, there was present 
the little lawyer man who had 
had a bad time with Daddy a 
week earlier — and my brother 
Clark. I couldn’t figure out 
how he got there. .except 
that Clark has an infallible 
homing instinct for trouble. 

Clark looked at me with no 
expression ; I nodded. The 
Director and his legal beagle 
stood up. Uncle Tom didn’t 
but he said, “Dr. Hyman 
Schoenstein, Mr. Poon Kwai 
Yau — my niece Podkayne 
Fries. Sit down, honey. No- 
body is going to bite you. The 
Director has a proposition to 
offer you.” 

The lawyer man interrupt- 
ed. “I don’t think — ” 
“Correct,” agreed Uncle 
Tom. “You don’t think. Or it 
would have occurred to you 
that ripples spread out from a 
splash.” 

“But— Dr. Schoenstein, the 
release I obtained from Pro- 
fessor Fries explicitly binds 
him to silence, for separate 
good and sufficient consider* 
ation, over and above damages 
conceded by us and made 
good! This is tantamount to 
blackmail. I—”

Then Uncle Tom did stand 
up. He seemed twice as tall as 
usual and he was grinning like 
a fright mask. “What was that 
last word you used?’* 

“I ?” The lawyer looked 
startled. “Perhaps I spoke 
hastily. I simply meant — ” 

“I heard you,” Uncle Tom 
growled. “And so did three 
witnesses. Happens to be one 
of the words a man can be 
challenged for, on this still 
free planet. But, since I'm 
getting old and fat, I may 
just sue you for your shirt in- 
stead. Come along, kids.” 

The Director spoke quickly. 
“Tom... sit down, please. Mr. 
Poon ... please keep quiet un- 
less I ask for your advice. 
Now, Tom, you know quite 
well that you can’t challenge 
nor sue over a privileged com- 
munication, counsel to client.” 

“I can do both or either. 
Question is: will a court sus- 
tain me? But 1 can always 
find out,” 

“And thereby drag out into 
the open the very point you 
know quite well I can’t af- 
ford to have dragged out. 
Simply because my lawyer 
spoke in an excess of zeal. 
Mr. Poon?” 

“I tried to withdraw it. I 
do withdraw it.” 

“Senator?” 

Uncle Tom bowed stiffly to 
Mr. Poon, who returned it. 
“Accepted, sir. No offense 
meant and none taken.” Then 


Uncle Tom grinned merrily, 
let his pot-belly slide back 
down out of his chest, and 
said in his normal voice. 
“Okay, Hymie, let’s get on 
with the crime. Your move.” 

D R. SCHOENSTEIN said 
carefully, “Young lady, I 
have just learned that the re- 
cent disruption of family 
planning in your home — 
which we all deeply regret — 
caused an additional sharp 
disappointment to you and 
your brother.” 

“It certainly did !” I an- 
swered, rather shrilly I'm 
afraid. 

“Yes. As your uncle put it, 
the ripples spread out. An- 
other of those ripples could 
wreck this establishment, 
make it insolvent as a private 
business. This is an odd sort 
of business we are in here, 
Miss Fries. Superficially we 
perform a routine engineering 
function, plus some not tin- 
usual boarding nursery serv- 
ices. But in fact what we do 
touches the most primitive of 
human emotions. If confi- 
dence in our integrity, or in 
the perfection with which we 
carry out the service entrust- 
ed to us, were to be shaken — ” 
He spread his hands helpless- 
ly. “We couldn’t last out the 
year. Now I can show you ex- 
actly how the mishap oc- 
curred which affected your 
family, show you how wildly

unlikely it was to have it hap- 
pen even under the methods 
we did use... prove to you 
how utterly impossible it now 
is and always will be in the 
future for such a mistake to 
take place again, under our 
new procedures. Neverthe- 
less — ” he looked helpless 
again — “if you were to talk, 
merely tell the simple truth 
about what did indeed happen 
once... you could ruin us.” 

I felt so sorry for him that 
I was about to blurt out that 
I wouldn’t even dream of talk- 
ing ! — even though they had 
ruined my life — when Clark 
cut in. “Watch it, Pod ! It’s 
loaded.” 

« 

So I just gave the Director 
my Sphinx expression and 
said nothing. Clark’s instinc- 
tive self-interest is absolutely 
reliable. 

Dr. Schoenstein motioned 
Mr. Poon to keep quiet. “But, 
my dear lady, I am not asking 
you not to talk. As your uncle 
the Senator says, you are not 
here to blackmail and I have 
nothing with Which to bar- 
gain. The Marsopolis Creche 
Foundation, Limited, always 
carries out its obligations 
even when they do not result 
from formal contract. I asked 
you to come in here in order 
to suggest a measure of relief 
for the damage we. have un- 
questionably— though unwit- 
tingly — done you and your 
brother. .Your uncle tells me 

26 


that he had intended to travel 
with you and your family. 
but that now he intends to go 
via the next Triangle Line de- 
parture. The Tricorn , I be- 
lieve it is, about ten days 
from now. Would you feel 
less mistreated if we were to 
pay first class fares for your 
brother and you — round trip, 
of course — in the Triangle 
Line?” 

Would I! The Wanderlust 
has, as her sole virtue, the 
fact that she is indeed ' a 
spaceship and she was shap- 
ing for Earth. But she is an 
old, slow freighter. Whereas 
the Triangle Liners, as every- 
one knows, are utter palaces! 
I could but nod. 

“Good. It is our privilege 
and we hope you have a won- 
derful trip. But, uh, young 
lady. .do you think it pos- 
sible that you could give us 
some assurance, for no con- 
sideration and simply out of 
kindness, that you wouldn’t 
talk about a certain regret- 
table mishap?” 

“Oh? I thought that was 
part of the deal?” 

“There is no deal. As your 
uncle pointed out to me, we 
owe you this trip, no matter 
what.” 

“Why — why, Doctor, I’m 
going to be so\>usy, so utterly 
rushed, just to get ready in 
time, that I won’t have time 
to talk to anyone about any 
mishaps that probably weren’t 

. fey Robert A. Heinlein 



your fault anyhow!” 

“Thank you.” He turned to 
Clark. “And you, son?” 

Clark doesn’t like to be 
called “son” at best. But I 
don’t think it affected his an- 
swer. He ignored the vocative 
and said coldly, “What about 
our expenses?” 

D R. Schoenstein flinched. 

Uncle Tom guffawed and 
said, “That’s my boy! Doc, I 
told you he had the simple ra- 
pacity of a sand gator. He’ll 
go far — if somebody doesn’t 
poison him.” 

“Any suggestions?” 

“No trouble. Clark. Look 
me in the eye. Either you stay 
behind and we weld you into 
a barrel and feed you through 
the bunghole so that you can't 
talk — while your sister goes 
anyhow— or you accept these 
terms. Say a thousand each — 
no, fifteen hundred — for trav- 
el expenses, and you keep 
your snapper’ shut forever 
about the baby mixup ... or I 
personally, with the aid of 
four stout, black-hearted ac- 
complices, will cut your 
tongue out and feed it to the 
cat. A deal?” 

“I ought to get ten per cent 
commission on Sis’s fifteen 
hundred. She didn’t have 
sense enough to ask for it.” 
“No cumshaw. I ought to be 
charging you a commission on 
the whole transaction. A 
deal?” 

“A deal ” Clark agreed. '

. Uncle Tom stood up. “That 
does it. Doc. In his own un- 
appetizing way he is as utter- 
ly reliable as she is. So relax. 
You, too, Kwai Yau, you can 
breathe again. Doc, you can 
send a check around to me in 
the morning. Come on, kids.” 

“Thanks, Tom. If that is the 
word. I’ll have the check over 
before you get there. Uh... 
just one thing—” 

What, Doc?” 

Senator, you were here 
long before I was born, so I 
don’t know too much about 
your early life. Just the tra- 
ditional stories and what it 
says about you in Who's Who 
on Mars. Just what were you 
transported for? You u^ere 
transported? Weren’t you?” 
Mr. Poon looked horror- 
stricken, and I was. But Un- 
cle Tom didn’t seem offended. 
He laughed heartily and an- 
swered, “I was accused of 
^freezing babies for prof it.. Rut 
it ! was a frameupi— J never did 
no ) such thing nohow. Come 
on, kids. Let’s get out of this 
' ghouls’ nest before they 
smuggle us down into the 
sub-basement.” 

Later that night in bed I 
was dreamily thinking over 
the trip. There hadn’t even 
been the least argument with 
Mother and Daddy; Uncle 
Tom had settled it all by 
1 phone before we got home; I 
heard a sound from the nurs- 
ery, got up and paddled in. It

was Duncan, the little darling, 
not even wet but lonely. So I 
picked him up and cuddled 
him and he cooed and then he 
was wet, so I changed him. 

I decided that he was just 
as pretty or prettier than all 
those other babies, even 
though he was five months 
younger and his eyes didn’t 
track. When I put him down 
again, he was sound asleep; I 
started back to bed. 

And stopped — 

The Triangle Line gets its 
name from serving the three 
leading planets, of course, but 
which direction a ship makes 
the Mars-Venus-Earth route 
depends on just where we all 
are in our orbits. 

But just where were we? 

I hurried into the living 
room and searched for the 
Daily War Whoop — found it, 
thank goodness, and fed it 
into the viewer, flipped to the 
shipping news. 

Yes, yes, yes ! I am going 
not only to Earth — but to Ve- 
nus as well! 

Venus ! Do you suppose 
Mother would let me — no, 
best iust say nothing now. Un- 
cle Tom will be more tract- 
able, after we get there. 

I’m going to miss Duncan — 
he’s such a little doll. 

IV 

1 haven’t had time to write in 
this journal for days . Just 
getting ready to leave was al- 

28 


most impossible — and would 
have been truly impossible 
had it not been that most 
preparations — all the special 
T e r r a n innoculations and 
photographs and passports 
and such — were mostly done 
before Everything Came Un- 
stuck ; But Mother came out 
of her atavistic daze and was 
very helpful. She would even 
let one of the triplets cry for 
as much as a minute rather 
than disappear and leave me 
half pinned up. 

I don’t know how Clark got 
ready or whether he had any 
preparations to make. He con- 
tinued to creep around silent- 
ly, answering in grunts if he 
answered at all. Nor did Uncle 
Tom seem to find it difficult. 
I saw him only twice during 
those frantic ten days (once 
to borrow baggage mass from 
his allowance, which he let 
me have, the dear!) and both 
times I had to dig him out of 
the card roornT at the Elks 
i Club. I asked him how he 
managed to get readv for so 
important a trip and still have 
time to play cards? 

“Nothing to it,” he an- 
swered. “I bought a new 
toothbrush. Is there something 
else I should have done?” 

So I hugged him and told 
him he was an utterly utter 
beast and he chuckled and 
mussed my hair. Query: Will 
I ever become that blase about 
space travel? I suppose I must 
if I am to be an astronaut. 

by Robert A. Heinlefii 



But Daddy says that getting 
ready s for a trip is half the 
fun ... so perhaps I don’t want 
to became that sophisticated. 

Somehow Mother delivered 
me, complete with baggage 
and all the myriad pieces of 
paper — tickets and medical 
records and passport and uni- 
versal identification complex 
and guardians’ assignment- 
and-guarantee and three kinds 
of money and traveler s’ 
checks and birth record and 
police certification and se- 
curity clearance and I don’t 
remember — all checked off, to 
the city shuttle port. I was 
juggling one package of 
things that simply wouldn’t go 
into my luggage, and I had 
one hat on my head and one in 
my hand. Otherwise every- 
thing came out even. 

Good-by at the shuttle port* 
was most teary and exciting. 
Not just with Mother and 
Daddy, which was to be ex- 
pected (when Daddy put his 
arm around me tight, I threw 
both mine around him and for 
a dreadful second I didn't 
want to leave at all), but also 
because about thirty of my 
classmates showed up (which 
I hadn’t in the least expect- 
ed), complete with a banner 
that two of them were carry- 
ing reading: 

BON VOYAGE 
PODKAYNE 

I got kissed enough times to 
start a fair-sized epidemic if 


any one of them had had any- 
thing, which apparently they 
didn’t. I got kissed by boys 
who had never even tried to, 
in the past — and I assure you 
that it is not utterly impossi- 
ble to kiss me, if the project 
is approached with confidence 
and finesse, as I believe that 
one’s instincts should be al- 
lowed to develop as well as 
one’s overt cortical behavior. 

The corsage Daddy had 
given me for going away got 
crushed and I didn’t even no- 
tice it until we were aboard 
the shuttle. I suppose it was 
somewhere about then that I 
lost that hat, but I’ll never 
know. I would have lost the 
last-minute package, too, if 
Uncle Tom had not rescued it. 
There were photographers, 
too, but not for me — for Uncle 
Tom. Then suddenly we had 
to scoot aboard the shuttle 
right now because a shuttle 
can’t wait. It has to boost on 
the split second, even though 
Deimos moves so much more 
slowly than Phobos. A report- 
er from the War Whoop was 
still trying to get a statement 
out of Uncle Tom about the 
forthcoming Three-P 1 a n e t s 
conference but he just pointed 
at his throat and whispered, 
“Laryngitis” — then we were 
aboard just before they sealed 
the airlock. 

It must have been the short- 
est case of laryngitis on rec- 
ord. Upcle Tom’s voice had 


PODKAYNE OF MARS 


29 



been all right until we got to 
the shuttle port and it was 
okay again once we were in 
the shuttle. 

O NE shuttle trip is exactly 
like another, whether to 
Phobos or Deimos. Still, that 
first tremendous whoosh ! of 
acceleration is exciting as it 
pins you down into your 
couch with so much weight 
that you can't breathe, much 
less move — and free fall is al- 
ways strange and eerie and 
rather stomach-fluttering even 
if one doesn't tend to be nau- 
seated by it, which, thank you, 
I don't. 

Being on Deimos is just like 
being «in free fall, since nei- 
ther Deimos nor Phobos has 
enough surface gravitation for 
one to feel it. They put suc- 
tion sandals on us before they 
unstrapped us so that we 
could walk, just as they do on 
Phobos. Nevertheless Deimos 
is different from Phobos for 
reasons having nothing to do 
with natural phenomena. Pho- 
bos is, of course, legally a part 
of Mars. There are no formali- 
ties of any sort about visiting 
it. All that is required is the 
fare, a free day and a yen for 
a picnic in space. 

But Deimos is a free port, 
leased in perpetuity to Three- 
Planets Treaty Authority. A 
known criminal, with a price 
on his head in Marsopolis, 
could change ships there right 
under the eyes of our own 


police. We couldn't touch 
him. Instead, we would have 
to start most complicated le- 
gal doings at the Interplane- 
tary High Court on Luna, 
practically win the case ahead 
of time and, besides that, 
prove that the crime was a 
crime under Three-P 1 a n e t 
rules and not just under our 
own laws. Then all that we 
could do would be to ask the 
Authority’s proctors to arrest 
the man if he was still around 
— which doesn't seem likely. 

I knew about this, theoreti- 
cally, because there had been 
about a half page on it in our 
school course Essentials oi 
Martian Government in the 
section on “Extraterritorial- 
ity." But now I had plenty of 
time to think about it because, 
as soon as we left the shuttle, 
we found ourselves locked up 
in a room misleadingly called 
the '‘Hospitality Room" while 
we waited until they were 
ready to “process" us. 

One wall of the room was 
glass. I could see lots and lots 
of people hurrying around in 
the concourse beyond, doing 
all manner of interesting and 
mysterious things. But all we 
had to do was to wait beside 
our baggage and grow bored. 

I found that I was growing 
more furious by the minute, 
not at all like my normally 
sweet and lovable nature. 
Why, this place had been 
built by my own mother! And 
here I was, caged up in it like 


30 


by Robert A. Hein lei n 



white mice in a bio lab. 

(Well, I admit that Mother 
didn’t exactly build Deimos. 
The Martians did that, start- 
ing with a spare asteroid that 
they happened to have handy. 
But some millions of years 
back they grew tired of space 
travel and devoted all their 
time to the whichness of what 
and how to unscrew the in- 
scrutable — so when Mother 
took over the job, Deimos was 
pretty run down ; she had to 
start in from the ground up 
and rebuild it completely.) 

I N any case, it was certain 
that everything that I could 
see through that transparent 
wall was a product of Moth- 
er’s creative imaginative and 
hard-headed engineering abil- 
ity. I began to fume. Clark 
was off in a corner, talking 
privately to some stranger. 
“Stranger” to me, at least. 
Clark, for all his anti-social 
disposition, always seems to 
know somebody, or to know 
somebody who knows some- 
body, anywhere we go. I 
sometimes wonder if he is a 
member of some vast under- 
ground secret society; he has 
such unsavory acquaintances 
and never brings any of them 
home. 

Clark is, however, a very 
satisfactory person to fume 
with, because, if he isn’t busy,' 
he is always willing to help a 
person hate anything that 
needs hating. He can even dig 


up reasons why a situation is 
even more vilely unfair than 
you thought it was. But he 
was busy, so that left Uncle 
Tom. So I explained to him 
bitterly how outrageous I 
thought it was that we should 
be penned up like animals — 
free Mars citizens on one of 
Mars’ own moons ! — simply 
because a sign read : “Passen- 
gers must wait until called by 
order of Three-Planets Treaty 
Authority.” 

“Politics!” I said bitterly. 
“I could run it better myself.” 

“I’m sure you could,” he 
agreed gravely, “but, flicka, 
you don’t understand.” 

“I understand all too well!” 

“No, honey bun. You under- 
stand that there is no good 
reason why you should not 
walk straight through that 
door and enjoy yourself by 
shopping until it is time to go 
inboard the Tricorn. And you 
are right about that, for there 
is no need at all for you to be 
locked up in here when you 
could be out there making 
some free port shopkeeper 
happy by paying him a high 
price which seems to you a 
low price. So you say, ’Poli- 
tics !’ as if it were a nasty 
word — and you think that set- 
tles it.” 

i 

He sighed. “But you don’t 
understand. Politics is not 
evil. Politics is the human 
race’s most magnificent 
achievement. When politics is 
good, it’s wonderful. .and 


PODKAYNE OF MARS 


31 



when politics is bad — well, it's 
still pretty good/' 

“I guess I don’t under- 
stand/’ I 'said slowly. 

“Think about it. Politics is 
just a name for the way we 
get things done. .without 
fighting. We dicker and com- 
promise and everybody thinks 
he has received a raw deal, 
but somehow after a tedious 
amount of talk we come up 
with some jury-rigged way to 
do it without getting any- 
body’s head bashed in. That’s 
politics. The only other way 
to settle a dispute is by bash- 
ing a few heads in. .and that 
is what happens when one or 
both sides is no longer willing 
to dicker. That’s why I say 
politics is good even when it 
is bad. The only alternative is 
force — and somebody gets 
hurt.” 

“Uh. .it seems to me that’s 
a funny way for a revolution- 
ary veteran to talk. From

what I’ve heard, Uncle Tom, 
you were one of the blood- 
thirsty ones who started the 
shooting. Or so Daddy says.” 

H E grinned. “Mostly I 
ducked. If dickering 
won’t work, then you have to 
fight. But I think maybe it 
takes a man who has been shot 
at to appreciate how much 
better it is to fumble your way 
through a political compro- 
mise rather than have the top 
of your head blown off.” He 
frowned and suddenly looked 
very old. “When to talk and 
when to fight — That is the 
most difficult decision to 
make wisely of all the de- 
cisions in life.” Then sudden- 
ly he smiled and the years 
dropped away. “M a n k i n d 
didn’t invent fighting; it was 
here long before we were. 
But we invented politics. Just 
think of it, hon. Homo sapiens 
is the most cruel, the most vi- 
cious, the most predatory and 
certainly the most deadly of 
the time, get along well 
enough so that we usually 
don’t kill each other. So don’t 
let me hear you using ‘poli- 
tics’ as a swear word again.” 
w I'm sorry, Uncle Tom,” I 
Said humbly. 

*Like fun you are. But if 
you let that idea soak for 
twenty or thirty years, you 
may — Oh, oh! There’s your 
villain, baby girl. The politi- 
cally appointed bureaucrat 
who has most unjustly held 


32 


by Robert A. Heinlein 


you in durance vile. So 
scratch his eyes out. Show 
him how little you think 6f 
his silly rules.” 

I answered this with digni- 
fied silence. It is hard to tell 
when Uncle Tom is serious. 
He loves to pull my leg, al- 
ways hoping that it will come 
off in his hand. The Three- 
Planets proctor of whom he 
was speaking had opened the 
door to our bull pen and was 
looking around exactly like a 
zookeeper inspecting a cage 
for cleanliness. “Passports !” 
he called out. “Diplomatic 
passports first.” He looked us 
over, spotted Uncle Tom. 
“Senator?” 

Uncle Tom shook his head. 
“I’m a tourist, thanks.” 

“As you say, sir. Line up, 
please. Reverse alphabetical 
order” — which put us near the 
tail of the line instead of near 
the head. There followed mad- 
dening delays, for fully two 
hours — passports, health clear- 
ance, outgoing baggage in- 
spection. Mars Republic does 
not levy duties on exports, 
but just the same there is a 
whole long list of things you 
can’t export without a license, 
such as ancient Martian arti- 
facts (the first explorers did 
their best to gut the place and 
some of the most priceless are 
in the British Museum or the 
'Kremlin; I’ve heard Daddy 
fume about it), some things 
you can’t export under any 
circumstances, such as certain 


narcotics, and some things 
you can take aboard ship only 
by surrendering them for 
safekeeping by the purser, 
such as guns and other weap- 
ons. 

Clark picked outgoing in- 
spection for some typical ab- 
normal behavior. They had 
passed down the line copies of 
a long list of things we must 
not have in our baggage. A 
fascinating list; I hadn’t 
known that there were so 
many things that were illegal, 
immoral or deadly. When the 
Fries contingent wearily 
reached the inspection coun- 
ter, the inspector said, all 
in one word: “ ‘Nything-t’- 

d’clare?” He was a Marsman 
and as he looked up he recog- 
nized Uncle Tom. “Oh. 
Howdy, Senator. Honored to 
have you with us. Well, I 
guess we needn’t waste time 
on your baggage. These two 
young people with you?” 

“Better search my kit,” Un- 
cle Tom advised. “I’m smug- 
gling guns to -an out-planet 
branch of the Legion. As for 
the kids, they’re my niece and 
nephew. But I don’t vouch for 
them ; they’re both subversive 
characters. Especially the 
girl. She was soap-boxing 
revolution lust now.” 

The inspector smiled and 
said, “I guess we can allow 
you a few guns, Senator. You 
know how Mo use them. Well, 
how ab&ut it, kids? Anything 
to declare?” 


PODKAYNE OF MARS 


33 



I said, ‘‘Nothing to declare/' 
with icy dignity — when sud- 
denly Clark spoke up. 

“Sure!” he piped, his voice 
cracking. “Two kilos of happy 
dust! And whose business is 
it? I paid for it. I'm not go- 
ing to let it be stolen by a 
bunch of clerks.” His voice 
was surly as only he can man- 
age and the expression on his 
face simply ached for a slap. 

T HAT did it. The inspector 
had been just about to 
glance into one of my bags — a 
purely formal inspection, I 
think — when my brattish. 
brother deliberately stirred 
things up. At the very word 
“happy dust” four other in- 
spectors closed in. Two were 
Venusmen, to judge by their 
accents, and the other two 
might have been from Earth. 

Of course, happy dust 
doesn’t matter to us Marsmen. 
The Martians use it, have al- 
ways used it, and it is about as 
important to them as tobacco 
is to humans, but apparently 
without any ill effects. What 
they get out of it I don’t 
know. Some of the old sand 
rats among us have picked up 
the habit from the Martians. 
But my entire botany class 
experimented with it under 
our teacher's supervision and 
nobody got any thrill out of it 
and all I got was blocked 
sinuses that wore off before 
the day was out. Strictly zero 
squared. 


But with the native Veneri- 
ans it is another matter — 
when they can get it. It turns 
them into murderous maniacs. 
They’ll do anything to get it. 
The (black market) price on 
it there is very high indeed 
...and possession of it by a 
human on Venus is at least an 
automatic life sentence to Sat- 
urn’s moons. 

They buzzed around Clark 
like angry jetta wasps. 

But they did not find what 
they were looking for. Short- 
ly Uncle Tom spoke up and 
said, “Inspector? May I make 
a suggestion?” 

“Eh? Certainly you may. 
Senator.” 

“My nephew, I am sorry to 
say, has caused a disturbance. 
Why don’t you put him aside 
— chain him up, I would — and 
let all these other good people 
go through?” 

The inspector blinked. “I 
think that is an excellent 
idea.” 

“And I would appreciate it 
if you would inspect myself 
and my niece now. Then we 
won’t hold up the others.” 

“Oh, that’s not necessary.” 
The inspector slapped seals on 
all of Uncle’s bags, closed the 
one of mine he had started to 
open and said, “I don’t need 
to paw through the young 
lady’s pretties. But I think 
we’ll take this smart boy and 
search him to the skin and 
X-ray him.” 

“Do that.”

So Uncle and I went on and 
checked at four or five other 
desks — fiscal control and 
migration and reservations 
and other nonseivs e — and 
finally wound up with our 
baggage at the centrifuge for 
weighing in. I never did get a 
chance to shop. ? 

T O my chagrin, when I 
stepped off the merry-go- 
round the record showed that 
my baggage and myself were 
nearly three kilos over my al- 
lowance. That didn’t seem 
possible. I hadn’t eaten more 
breakfast than usual — less ac- 
tually — and I hadn’t drunk 
any water because, while I do 
not become ill in free fall, 
drinking in free fall is very 
tricky. You are likely to get 
water up your nose or some- 
thing and set off an embar- 
rassing chain reaction. 

So I was about to protest 
bitterly that the weightmaster 
had spun the centrifuge too 
fast and produced a false mass 
reading. But it occurred to me 
that I did not know for surely 
certain that the scales Mother 
and I had used were perfectly 
accurate. So I kept quiet. 

Uncle Tom just reached for 
his purse but the weight-mas- 
ter shook his head. “Forget it, 
Senator. I'm minus on a cou-- 
pie of other things; I think I 
can swallow it. If not, I'll 
leave a memo with the purser. 
But I’m fairly sure I can.” 
“Thank you. What did you 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


say your name was?” 

“Milo. Miles M. Milo— 
Aasvogel Lodge number sev- 
enty-four. Maybe you saw our 
crack drill team at the Legion 
convention two years ago. I 
was left pivot.” 

“I certainly did, I certainly 
did !” They exchanged that 
secret grip that they think 
other people don't know and 
Uncle Tom said, “Well, 
thanks. Miles. Be seeing you.” 

“Not at all — Tom. No, 
don't bother with your bag- 
gage.” Mr. Milo touched a 
button and called out, “In the 
Tricorn ! Get somebody out 
here fast for the Senator’s 
baggage.” 

It occurred to me, as we 
stopped at the passenger tube 
sealed to the transfer station 
to swap our suction sandals 
for little magnet pads that 
clipped to our shoes, that we 
need not have waited for any- 
thing at any time — if only 
Uncle Tom had been willing 
to use the special favors he so 
plainly could demand. 

But, even so, it pays to trav- 
el with an important person- 
even though it's just your Un- 
cle Tom whose stomach you 
used to jump up and down on 
when you were small enough 
for such things. Our tickets 
simply read “First Class” — 
I'm sure, for I saw all three of 
them — but where we were 
placed was in what they call 
the “Owner’s Cabin,” which is 
actually a suite with three 

35 



bedrooms and a living room. 

I was dazzled ! 

But I didn't have time to 
admire it just then. First they 
strapped our baggage down, 
then they strapped us down — 
to seat couches which were 
against one wall of the living 
room. That wall plainly 
should have been the floor, 
but it slanted up almost verti- 
cally with respect to the tiny, 
not-quite-nothing weight that 
we had. The warning sirens 
were already sounding when 
someone dragged Clark in and 
strapped him to one of the 
couches. He was looking 
mussed up but cocky. 

"Hi, smuggler," Uncle Tom 
greeted him amiably. "They 
find it on you?" 

"Nothing to find." 

"That’s what I thought. I 
trust they gave you a rough 
time.” 

"Naah !" 

I wasn’t sure I believed 
Clark’s answer; I’ve heard 
that a skin & person search 
can be made quite annoying 
indeed, without doing any- 
thing the least bit illegal, if 
the proctors are feeling un- 
friendly. A "rough time" 
would be good for Clark’s 
soul, I am sure. But he cer- 
tainly did not act as if the 
experience had caused • him 
any discomfort. I said, "Clark, 
that was a very foolish re- 
mark you made ‘to the in- 
spector. And it wai a lie, as * 
well. A silly, useless lie." 

"Sign off, 1 ’ he said curtly. 

36 


"If I’m smuggling anything, 
it’s up to them to find it; 
that’s what they’re 'paid 
for. ‘Any-thing-t’-d’clare?’ " 
he added in a mimicking 
voice. "What nonsense! As if 
anybody would declare some- 
thing he was trying to smug- 
gle." 

- "Just the same," I went on, 
"if Daddy had heard you 
say — ’’ 

"Podkayne." 

“Yes, Uncle Tom?" 

"Table it. We’re about to 
start. Let’s enjoy it." 

"But — Yes, Uncle." 

T HERE was a slight drop 
in pressure, then a sudden 
surge that would have slid us 
out of our couches if we had 
not been strapped — but not a 
strong one, not at all like that 
giant whoosh ! with which we 
had left the surface. It did 
not last long. Then we were 
truly in free fall for a few 
moments. .then there started 
a soft, gentle push in the 
same direction, which kept 
up. 

Then the room started very 
slowly to turn around... al- 
most unnoticeable except for 
a slight dizziness it gave one. 

Gradually, gradually (it 
took almost twenty minutes) 
our weight increased, until at 
last we were back to our prop- 
er weight. .at which time the 
floot*', Which had been all 
wrong whfen we came in, was 
where it belonged, unde i us, 
and almost level. 1

The first ‘stidpt boost w&s 

• * v, i t ' t r. ' ’ . f .

.. % f ;■ r t ' = 5 t : 5 C • I 



made by the racket tugs of 
Deimos Port picking up the 
Tricorn and hurling her out 
into a free orbit of her own. 
This doesn't take much, be- 
cause the attraction between 
even a big ship like the Tri- 
corn and a tiny, tiny satellite 
such as Deimos isn't enough 
to matter. All that matters is 
getting the very considerable 
mass of the ship shoved free. 

The second gentle shove, 
the one that kept up and nev- 
er went away, was the ship’s 
own main drive — one-tenth of 
a standard gee. The Tricorn 
is a constant-boost ship. She 
doesn’t dilly-dally around 
with economical orbits and 
weeks and months in free fall. 
She goes very fast indeed... 
because even 0.1 gee adds up 
awfully fast. 

But one-tenth gee is not 
enough to make comfortable 
passengers who have been 
used to more. As soon as the 
Captain had set her on her 
course, he started to spin her 
and kept it up until the cen- 
trifugal force and the boost 
added up (in vector addition, 
of course) to exactly the sur- 
face gravitation of Mars (or 
37% of a standard gee) at the 
locus of the first-class state- 
rooms. 

But the floors will not be 
quite level until we approach 
Earth, because the inside of 
the ship had been constructed 
so that the floors would feel 
perfectly level when the spin 
and the boost added up to ex- 
actly one standard gravity — 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


or Earth-Normal. 

Maybe this isn't too clear. 
Well, it wasn't too clear to 
me, in school. I didn’t see ex- 
actly how it worked out until 
(later) I had a chance to see 
the controls used to put spin 
on the ship and how the cen- 
trifugal force was calculated. 
Just remember that the Tri- 
con? — and her sisters, the 
Trice and the Triad and the 
Triangulum and the Tricolor 
— are enormous cylinders. 
The thrust is straight along 
the main axis. It has to be. 
Centrifugal force pushes 
away from the main axis — 
how else? The two forces add 
up to make the ship’s “artifi- 
cial gravity” in passenger 
country. But, since one force 
(the boost) is kept constant 
and the other (the spin) .can 
be varied, there can be only 
one rate of spin which will 
add in with the boost to make 
those floors perfectly level. 

For the Tricorn the spin 
that will produce level floors 
and exactly one Earth gravi- 
ty in passenger country is 
5.42 revolutions per minute. I 
know because the Captain 
told me so... and I checked 
his arithmetic and he was 
right. The floor of our cabin 
is just over thirty meters 
from the main axis of the 
ship, so it all comes out even. 

) 

A S soon ,as they had the 
floor back under us and 
had announced- L the “all clear" 
I unstrapped me and hurried 

out. I wanted a quick look at 

> 

37 



the ship; I didn’t even wait 
to unpack. 

There’s a fortune awaiting 
the man who invents a really 
good deodorizer for a space- 
ship. That’s the one thing you 
can’t fail to notice. 

Oh, they try, I grant them 
that. The air goes through 
precipitators each time it is 
cycled. It is washed, it is per- 
fumed, a precise fraction of 
ozone is added and the new 
oxygen that is put in after 
the carbon dioxide is distilled 
out is as pure as a baby’s 
mind. It has to be, for it is 
newly released as a by-prod- 
uct of the photosynthesis of 
living plants. That air is so 
pure that it really ought to be 
voted a medal by the Society 
for the Suppression of Evil 
Thoughts. 

Besides that, a simply amaz- 
ing amount of the crew’s time 
is put into cleaning, polish- 
ing, washing, sterilizing — oh, 
they try! 

But nevertheless, even a 
new, extra-fare luxury liner 
like the Tricorn simply reeks 
of human sweat and ancient 
sin, with undefinable over- 
tones of organic decay and 
unfortunate accidents and 
matters best forgotten. Once 
I was with Daddy when a 
Martian tomb was being un- 
sealed. I found out wlfy xeno- 
archeologists always' have gas 
masks handy. But a spaceship 
smells even worse than that 
tomb. 

It does no good to complain 
to the purser. He’ll listen 


with professional sympathy 
and send a crewman around 
to spray your stateroom with 
something which (I suspect) 
merely deadens your nose for 
a while. But his sympathy is 
not real, because the poor man 
simply cannot smell anything 
wrong himself. He has lived 
in ships for years; it is lit- 
erally impossible for him to 
smell the unmistakable reek 
of a ship that has been lived 
in. And, besides, he knows 
that the air is pure; the ship’s 
instruments show it. None of 
the professional spacers can 
smell it. 

But the purser and all of 
them are quite used to having 
passengers complain about 
the “unbearable stench” — so 
they pretend sympathy and 
go through the motions of 
correcting the matter. 

Jtfot that I complained. I 
was looking forward to hav- 
ing this ship eating out of my 
hand, and you don’t accom- 
plish^ that sort of coup by 
becoming known first thing 
as a complainer. But other 
first-timers did, and I cer- 
tainly understood why. In 
fact I began to have a glim- 
mer of a doubt about my am- 
bitions to become skipper of 
an explorer ship. 

But — 

Well, in about two days it 
seemed to me that they had 
managed to clean up the ship 
quite a bit, and shortly there- 
after I stopped thinking about 
it. I began to understand why 
the ship’s crew can’t smell the 

by Robert A. Heinlein 


38 



things the passengers com- 
plain about. Their nervous 
systems simply cancel out the 
did familiar stinks — like a cy- 
bernetic skywatch canceling 
out and ignoring any object 
whose predicted orbit has 
previously been programmed 
into the machine. 

But the odor is still there. 
I suspect that it sinks right 
into polished metal and can 
never be removed, short of 
scrapping the ship and melt- 
ing it down. Thank goodness 
the human nervous system is 
endlessly adaptable. 

B UT my own nervous sys- 
tem didn’t seem too adapt- 
able during that first hasty 
tour of the Tricorn . It is a 
good thing that I had not 
eaten much breakfast and had 
refrained from drinking any- 
thing. My stomach did give 
me a couple of bad moments, 
but I told it sternly that I 
was busy. I was very anxious 
to look over the ship; I sim- 
ply didn’t have time to cater 
to the weaknesses to which 
flesh is heir. 

Well, the Tricorn is lovely 
all right — every bit as nice as 
the travel folders say that she 
is... except for that dreadful 
ship’s odor. Her ball room is 
gorgeous and so big that you 
can see that the floor curves 
to match the ship. .only it is 
not curved when you walk 
across it. It is level, too. It is 
the only room in the ship 
where they jack up the floor 
to match perfectly with what- 


ever spin is on the ship. There 
is a lounge with a simulated 
sky of outer space, or it can 
be switched to blue sky and 
fleecy clouds. Some old bid- 
dies were already in there, 
gabbling. 

The dining saloon is every 
bit as fancy, but it seemed 
hardly big enough — which re- 
minded me of the warning in 
the travel brochure about first 
and second tables, so I rushed 
back to our cabin to urge Un- 
cle Tom to make reservations 
for us quickly before all the 
best tables were filled. 

He wasn’t there. I took a 
quick look in all the rooms 
and didn’t find him — but I 
found Clark in my room, just 
closing one of my bags ! 

“What are you doing?” I 
demanded. 

He jumped and then looked 
perfectly blank. “I was just 
looking to see if you had any 
nausea pills,” he said wood- 
enly. 

“Well, don’t dig into my 



; i : • > i 


PODKAYNE OF MARS

things! You know better.” I 
came up and felt his cheek. 
He wasn’t feverish. “I don’t 
have any. But I noticed where 
the surgeon’s office is. If you 
are feeling ill, I’ll take you 
straight there and let him 
dose you.” 

He pulled away. “Aw, I’m 
all right — now.” 

“Clark Fries, you listen to 
me. If you — ” But he wasn’t 
listening. He slid past me, 
ducked into his own room and 
closed the door; I heard the 
lock click. 

I closed the bag he had 
opened — and noticed some- 
thing. It was the bag the in- 
spector had been just about 
to search when Clark had 
pulled that silly stunt about 
“happy dust.” 

My younger brother never 
does anything without a rea- 
son. Never. 

His reasons often are in- 
scrutable to others. But, if 
you just dig deeply enough, 
you will always find that his 
mind is never a random- 
choice machine, doing things 
pointlessly. It is as logical as 
a calculator — and about as 
cold. 

I now knew why he had 
made what seemed to be en- 
tirely unnecessary trouble for 
himself at outgoing inspec- 
tion. 

I knew why I had been un- 
expectedly three kilos over 
my allowance on the centri- 
fuge. 

The only thing I didn’t 
know was: What had he 

40 


smuggled aboard in my bag- 
gage? 

And why? 

Interlude 

W ELL, Pod, I’m glad to 
see that you’ve resumed 
keeping your diary. Not only 
do I find your girlish view- 
points entertaining but also 
you sometimes (not often) 
provide me with useful bits 
of information. 

If I can do anything for 
you in return, do let me 
know. Perhaps you would 
like help in straightening out 
your grammar? Those incom- 
plete sentences you are so 
fond of indicate incomplete 
thinking. You know that, 
don’t you? 

For example, let us consid- 
er a purely hypothetical case: 
a delivery robot with an un- 
beatable seal. Since the seal 
is in fact unbeatable, think- 
ing about the seal simply 
leads to frustration. But a 
complete analysis of the situ- 
ation leads one to the obvious 
fact that any cubical or quasi- 
cubical object has six sides, 
and that the seal applies to 
only one of these six sides. 

Pursuing this line of 
thought one may note that, 
while the quasi-cube may not 
be moved without cutting its 
connections, the floor under 
it may be lowered as much as 
forty-eight centimeters — if 
one has all afternoon in 
which to work. 

Were this not a hypothet- 

by Robert A. Heinlein 



leal case I would now suggest 
the use of a mirror and light 
on an extension handle and 
some around-the-corner tools, 
plus plenty of patience. 

That’s what you lack. Pod 
. — patience, 

I hope this may shed some 
, light on the matter of the 
hypothetical happy dust. Do 
. feel free to come to me with 
your little problems,

C LARK kept his stateroom 
door locked all the time 
the first three days we were 
in * the Tricorn : I know, be- 
cause I tried it every time he 
left the suite. 

Then on the fourth day he 
failed to lock it at a time 
when ft was predictable that 
he would be gone at least an 
houTj as he had signed up for 
a tour of ’ the ship — the parts 
'passengers ordinarily are not 
’ allowed in, I mean. I didn’t 
mind missmg : ft myse’lf^ for v by 
then T had worked 1 ofct my 
own- private 4< Poddy> special” 
escort service. Nor did* I have 
to worry about * Uncle > T om. 
•He wasn't' making the tour, it 
would have violated his no- 
exercise rule, but he had ac- 
quired new pinochle cronies 
and he was safely in the 
smoking room. 

Those stateroom door locks 
are not impossible to pick. 
Not for a girl equipped with 
a nail file, some bits of this 
and that, and free run of the 
purser's office— me, I mean. 


But' I found I did not have 
to pick the lock. The catch 
had not quite caught. I 
breathed the conventional 
sigh of relief, I figured 
that the happy accident put 
me at least twenty minutes 
ahead of schedule. 


I shan’t detail the search, 
but I flatter myself that the 
Criminal Investigation Bu- 
reau could not have done it 
more logically nor more 
quickly if limited, as I was, to 
bare hands and no equipment. 
It had to be something foi> 
bidden by that list they had 
given us on Deimos — and I 
had carefully kept and studied 
my copy. It had to mass 
slightly over three kilos. It 
had to bulk so large and be 
sufficiently fixed in its shape 
and dimensions , that , Clark 
was forced to hide it in bag- 
gage. Otherwise I am sure, he 
would have concealed it on 
his person and coidly depend- 
ed. on his youth and '*inho- 
.^ence,” plus the chaperonage 
of Uncle Toni, to breeze him 

: # r '}• •• • r * I » . t 

through the outgoing inspec- 
tion. Otherwise he would nev- 


er have taken the calculated 
risk of hiding it in my bag- 
gage, since he couldn’t be sure 
of recovering it without my 


knowing. 


- Could he have predicted 
that I would at once go sight- 
seeing; without waiting to un- 
pack? Well, perhaps he could, 
even though I had done so on 
the spur of the moment. I 
must reluctantly admit that

maddening regularity. As an 
opponent, he is never to be 
underrated. But still it was 
for him a “calculated risk,” 
albeit a small one. 

Very well. Largish, rather 
massy, forbidden. But I didn’t 
know what it looked like and 
I had to assume that anything 
which met the first two re- 
quirements might be dis- 
guised to appear innocent. 

And so to work— 

Ten minutes later I knew 
that it had to be in one of his 
three bags, which I had left 
to the last on purpose as the 
least likely spots. A stateroom 
aboard ship has many cover 
plates, access holes, removable 
fixtures, and the like, but I 
had done a careful practice 
run in my own room; I knew 
which ones were worth open- 
ing, which ones could not be 
opened without power tools, 
which ones could not be 
opened without leaving un- 
mistakable sighs of tamper- 
ing. I checked these all in 
great haste, then congratulat- 
ed Clark on having the good 
sense not to use such obvious 
hiding places. 

T HEN I checked everything 
readily accessible — out in 
the open, in his wardrobe, etc. 
—using the classic “Purloined 
Letter” technique, i.e., J never 
assumed that a book was a 
book simply because it looked 
like a book, nor t;haf a jacket 
was simply that and nothing 
more. 

Null, negative, nothing. Re-

luctantly, I tackled his three 
pieces of luggage, first noting 
carefully exactly how they 
were stacked and in what or- 
der. 

The first was empty. Oh, 
the linings could have been 
tampered with, but the bag 
was no heavier than it should 
have been and any false 
pocket in the linings could 
not have held anything large 
enough to meet the specifica- 
tions. 

The second bag was the 
same. And the bag on the bot- 
tom seemed to be the same. 
until I found an envelope in 
a pocket of rt. Oh, nothing 
nearly massy enough, nor 
gross enough; just an ordi- 
nary envelope for a letter — 
but nevertheless I glanced at 
it. 

And was immediately in- 
dignant ! 

It had printed on it: 

M iss Podkayne Fries 

Passenger, S.S. Tricorn , 

For -delivery in ship 

Why, the little wretch! He 
had been intercepting my 
. mail ! With' fingers trembling 
with rage so badly that I 
could hardly do so I opened 
it — and discovered that it had 
already been opened and was 
angrier than ever. But, at 
least, the note was still inside. 
Shaking, I pulled it out and 
read it. 

Just six words— 

Hi, Pod. Snooping again , I 
* see. 

— in Clark’s handwriting, 

by Robert A. Hein loin 



I stood there, frozen, for a 
long moment, 'While I blushed 
scarlet and chewed the bitter 
realization that I had been 
hoaxed to perfection— again. 

There are only three people 
in the world who can make 
me feel stupid — and Clark is 
two of them. 

I heard a throat-clearing 
sound behind me and whirled 
around. Lounging in the open 
doorway (I had left it closed) 
was my brother. He smiled at 
me and said, "Hello, Sis. 
Looking for something? Need 
any help?" 

I didn’t waste time pretend- 
ing that I didn’t have jam 
all over my face ; I simply 
said, "Clark Fries, what did 
you smuggle into this ship in 
my baggage?" 

He looked blank — a look of 
malignant idiocy which has 
been known to drive well- 
balanced teachers to their 
therapists. "What in the 
world are you talking about, 
Pod?” 

"You know what Tifi talk- 
ing about! Smuggling!" 

"Oh!" His face lit up in a 
sunny smile, "You mean tliosi 
two kilograms of happy dust. 
Goodness, Sis, is that still 
worrying you? There never 
were any two kilos of happy 
dust. I was just having my 
little joke with that stuffy in- 
spector. I thought you knew 
that." 

"I do not mean any ‘two 
kilos of happy dust’! I am 
talking about at least three 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


kilos of something else that 
you hid in my baggage!" 

He looked worried* "Pod, 
do you feel well?" 

"Ooooooh —dandruff ! Clark 
Fries, you stop that! You 
know what I mean! When I 
was centrifuged, my bags and 
I weighed three kilos over my 
allowance. Well?" 

He looked at me thought- 
fully, sympathetically. "It 
has seemed to me that you 
were getting a bit fat — but I 
didn’t want to mention it. I 
thought it was all this rich 
food you've been tucking 
away here in the ship. You 
really ought to watch that 
sort of thing, Pod. After all, 
if a girl lets her figure go to 
pieces — Well, she doesn’t 
have much else. So I hear." 

Had that envelope been a 
blunt instrument I would 
have blunted him. I heard a 
low growling sound, and 
realized that I was making it. 
So I stopped. "Where’s the 
letter that was in this en- 
velope?" 

5 , • _ » ’’ •' 

Clark looked , surprised. 
"Why, it’s right there, in 
your other hand." 

"This? This is all there 
was? No letter from some- 
body else?" 

"Why, just that note from 
me, Sis. Didn’t you like it? 
I thought that it just suited 
the occasion... I knew you 
would find it your very first 
chance." He smiled. "Next 
time you ( \vant to paw through 
my things, let 1 me know and 
I’ll help. Sometimes I have 

43 



experiments running. You 
might get hurt. That can hap- 
pen to people who aren’t very 
bright and don’t look before 
they leap. I wouldn’t want 
that to happen to you , Sis.” 

I didn’t bandy any more 
words. I brushed past him 
and went to my own room and 
locked the door and bawled. 

Then I got up and did very 
careful things to my face. I 
know when Vm licked; I 
don’t have to have a full set 
of working drawings. I re- 
solved never to mention the 
matter to Clark again. 

But what was I to do? Go 
to. the Captain? I already 
knew the Captain pretty well ; 
his imagination extended as 
far as the next ballistic pre- 
diction and. no further. Tell 

* . > » 

him that my brother had been 
smuggling something, I didn’t 
hnqw what — and that he had 
better search, the entire ship 
most carefully, because, what- 
ever it was, it was not in my 
brother’s, ropm? Don’t be 
txiple silly,. : Poddy.. In. .the 
first place, he would laugh at 
you; in the second place, you 
don’t want 'Clark to be caught. 
Mother and Daddy wouldn’t 
like it. 

t 

Tell Uncle Tom about it? 
He might be just as unbeliev- 
ing. .or, if he did believe me, 
he might go to the Captain 
himself — with just as 1 disas- 
trous results. J 

V>' .( . 

I decided not tp. go to Un- 
cle Tom— at least not yet. In- 
stead I would y \keej4' rtiy eyes 
and ears open and’ try to find 


a workable answer myself. 

• . • ( 

I N any case I did not waste 
much time on Clark’s sins 
(if any, I had to admit in bare 
honesty). I was in my first 
real space ship— half way to 
my ambition thereby— a n d 
there was much to learn and 
do. 

i Those travel brochures, are 
honest enough, I guess, but 
they do not give you the full 
picture. , 

For example, take this bit 
right out of the text of the 
Triangle Line’s fancy folder: 
“Romantic days in ancient 
Marsopolis, the city older 
than time; exotic nights un- 
der the hurtling moons of

with illustrations, diagrams, 
and simple explanations — 
such as Daddy’s Other Paths 
Than Ours . (Adv.) 

As for those exotic nights, 
anybody who is outdoors af- 
ter sundown on Mars other 
than through sheer necessity 
needs to have his head exam- 
ined. It’s chilly out there. I’ve 
seen Deimos and Phobos at 
night exactly twice, each 
time through no fault of my 
own. And I was so busy keep- 
ing from/ freezing to death 
that I wasted no thought on 
“hurtling moons.” 

That advertising brochure 
is just as meticulously ac- 
curate — and just as deceptive 
in effect — concerning the 
ships themselves. Oh, the Tri- 
corn is a palace; I’ll vouch 
for that. It really is a miracle 
of engineering that anything 
so huge, so luxurious, so fan- 
tastically adapted to the 
health and comfort of human 
beings, should be able to 
“hurtle” (pardon the word) 
through space. 

But take those pictures — 

You know the ones I mean : 
Full color & depth, showing 
groups of handsome young 
people of both sexes chatting 
or playing games in the 
lounge, dancing gaily in the 
ballroom— or views of a 
“typical stateroom.” 

That “typical stateroom” is 
not a fake. No, it has simply 
been photographed from an 
angle and with a lens that 
makes it look at least twice 
as big as it is. As for those 


handsome, gay, young people 
— well, they aren’t along on 
the trip I’m making. It’s my 
guess that they are profes- 
sional models. 

In the Tricorn this trip the 
young and handsome passen- 
gers like those in the pictures 
can be counted on the thumbs 
of one hand. The typical pas- 
senger we have with us is a 
great grandmother, Terran 
citizenship, widowed, wealthy, 
making her first trip into 
space— and probably her last, 
for she is not sure she likes it. 

Honest, I’m not exaggerat- 
ing. Our passengers look like 
refugees from a geriatrics 
clinic. I am not scoffing at 
old age. I understand that it 
is a condition I will one day 
attain myself, if I go on 
breathing in and out enough 
times — say about 900,000,000 
more times, not counting 
heavy exercise. Old age can 
be a charming condition, as 
witness Uncle Tom. But old 
age is not an accomplishment. 
It is just something that hap- 
pens to you despite yourself, 
like falling downstairs. 

And I must say that I am 
getting a wee bit tired of hav- 
ing youth treated as a pun- 
ishable offense. 

O UR typical male passenger 
is the same sort, only not 
nearly so numerous. He dif- 
fers from his wife primarily 
in that, instead of looking 
down his nose at me, he is 
sometimes inclined to pat me 
in a “fatherly” way that I do 


PODKAYNE OF MARS 


45 



not find fatherly, don’t like, 
avoid if humanly possible — 
and which nevertheless gets 
me talked about. 

I suppose I should not have 
been surprised to find the 
Tricorn a super-deluxe old 
folks’ home, but (I may as 
well admit it) my experience 
is still limited and I was not 
aware of some of the econom- 
ic facts of life. 

The Tricorn is expensive. 
It is very expensive. Clark 
and I would not be in it at 
all if Uncle Tom had not 
twisted Dr. Schoenstein’s arm 
in our behalf. Oh, I suppose 
Uncle Tom can afford it, but, 
by age group though not by 
temperament, he fits the de- 
fined category. But Daddy 
and Mother had intended to 
take us in the Wanderlust , 
a low-fare, economy-orbit 
freighter. Daddy and Mother 
are not poor, but they are not 
rich. After they finish rais- 
ing and educating five chil- 
dren it is unlikely that they 
will ever be rich. 

Who can afford to travel in 
luxury liners? Ans. : Rich old 
widows, wealthy retired cou- 
ples, high-priced executives 
whose time is so valuable that 
their corporations gladly send 
them by the fastest ships — 
and an occasional rare excep- 
tion of some other sort. 

Clark and I are such excep- 
tions. We have one o,ther ex- 
ception in the ship, Miss — 
well. I’ll call her Miss Girdle 
FitzSnugglie, because if I 
used her right name and per- 

46 


chance anybody ever sees 
this, it would be all too easily 
recognizable. I think Girdie is 
a good sort, I don’t care what 
the gossips in this ship say. 
She doesn’t act jealous of me 
even though it appears that 
the younger officers in the 
ship were all her personal 
property until I boarded — all 
the trip out from Earth, I 
mean. I’ve cut into her monop- 
oly quite a bit, but she isn’t 
catty to me. She treats me 
warmly woman-to-woman, and 
I’ve learned quite a lot about 
Life and Men from her. 
more than Mother ever taught 
me. 

(It is just possible that 
Mother is slightly naive on 
subjects that Girdie knows 
best. A woman who tackles 
engineering and undertakes to 
beat men at their own game 
might have had a fairly limit- 
ed social life, wouldn’t you 
think? I must study this seri- 
ously ... because it seems pos- 
sible that much the same 
might happen to a female 
space pilot and it is no part 
of my Master Plan to become 
a soured old maid.) 

Girdie is about twice my 
age, which makes her awfully 
young in this company. Nev- 
ertheless it may be that I 
cause her to look just a bit 
wrinkled around the eyes. 
Contrariwise, my somewhat 
unfinished look may make her 
more mature contours appear 
even more Helen-of-Troyish. 
As may be, it is certain that 
my presence has relieved the 

by Robert A. Heinlein 



pressure on her by giving the 
gossips two targets instead of 
one. 

And gossip they do. I 
heard one of them say about 
her: “She’s been in more laps 
than a napkin!’’ 

If so, I hope she had fun. 

Those gay ship's dances in 
the mammoth ballroom! Like 
this: they happen every Tues- 
day and Saturday night, when 
the ship is spacing. The music 
starts at 20 :30 and the Ladies’ 
Society for Moral Rectitude 
is seated around the edge of 
the floor, as if for a wake. 
Uncle Tom is there, as a con- 
cession to me, and very 
proudsome and distinguished 
he looks in evening formal. 
I am there in a party dress 
which is not quite as girlish 
as it was when Mother helped 
me pick it out, in consequence 
of some very careful retailor- 
ing I ha V6 done with my door 
locked. Even Clark attends 
because there is nothing else 
going on and he‘s afraid he 
might miss something — and 
looking so nice I’m proud of 
him, because he has ‘to climb 
into his own monkey suit or 
he can’t come to the ball. 

Over by the punch bowl are 
half a dozen of the ship’s 
junior officers, dressed in 
mess jacket uniforms and 
looking faintly uncomfort- 
able. 

T HE Captain, by some 
process known only to 
him, selects one of the widows 
and asks her to dance. Two 
husbands dance with their 


wives. Uncle Tom offers me 
his arm and leads me to the 
floor. Two or three of the 
junior officers follow the 
Captain’s example. Clark 
takes advantage of the breath- 
less excitement to raid the 
punch bowl. 

But nobody asks Girdie to 
dance. 

This is no accident. The 
Captain has given the Word 
(I have this intelligence with 
utter certainty through My 
Spies) that no ship’s officer 
shall dance with Miss Fitz- 
Snugglie until he has danced 
at least two dances with oth- 
er partners — and I am not an 
“other partner,’’ because the 
proscription, since leaving 
Mars, has been extended to 
me. 

This should be proof to 
anyone that a captain of a 
ship is in sober fact the Last 
of the Absolute Monarchs. 

There are now six or seven 
couples on the floor and the 
fun is at its riotous height. 
The floor will never again be 
so crowded. Nevertheless 
nine-tenths of the chairs are 
still occupied and you could 
ride a bicycle around the 
floor without endangering the 
dancers. The spectators look 
as if they were knitting at 
the tumbrils. The proper fin- 
ishing touch would be a guil- 
lotine in the empty space in 
the middle of the floor. 

The music stops. Uncle 
Tom takes me back to my 
chair, then asks Girdie to 
dance — since he is a Cash 


PODKAYNE OF MARS

Customer, the Captain has not 
attempted to make him toe the 
mark. But I am still out of 
bounds, so I walk over to the 
punch bowl, take a cup out 
of Clark’s hands, finish it, and 
say, “Come on, Clark. I’ll let 
you practice on me.” 

“Aw, it’s a waltz !” (Or a 
“flea hop/’ or a “chasse,” or 
“five step” — but whatever it 
is, it is just too utterly im- 
possible.) 

“Do it — or I'll tell Madame 
Grew that you want to dance 
with her, only you’re too shy 
to ask her.” 

“You do and I’ll trip her! 
I’ll stumble and trip her.” 

However, Clark is weaken- 
ing, so I move in fast. “Look, 
Bub, you either take me out 
there and walk on my feet 
for a while — or I’ll see to it 
that Girdie doesn’t dance with 
you at all.” 

That does it. Clark is in the 
throes of his first case of 
puppy love, and Girdie is 
such a gent that she treats 
him as an equal and accepts 
his attentions with warm 
courtesy. So Clark dances 
with me. Actually he is quite 
a good dancer and I have to 
lead him only a tiny bit. He 
likes to d a n c e — but he 
wouldn’t want anyone, espe- 
cially me, to think that he 
likes to dance with his sister. 
We don’t look too badly 
matched, since I . am short. In 
the meantime Girdie 1 is, look- 
ing very gfood indeed with 
Uncle Tom, which is quite an 

accomplishment/ as Uncle 

-* >

Tom dances with great enthu- 
siasm and no rhythm. But 
Girdie can follow anyone. If 
her partner broke his leg, she 
would fracture her own at the 
same spot. But the crowd is 
thinning out now; husbands 
that danced the first dance 
are too tired for the second 
and no one has replaced 
them. 

Oh, we have gay times in 
the interplanetary luxury lin- 
er Tricorn! 

Truthfully we do have gay 
times. Starting with the third 
dance Girdie and I have our 
pick of the ship’s officers, 
most of whom are good 
dancers, or at least have had 
plenty of practice. About 
twenty-two o’clock the Cap- 
tain goes to bed and shortly 
after that the chaperones Start 
putting away their whetstones 
and fading, one by one. By 
midnight there is just Girdie 
and myself and half a dozen 
of the younger officers — and 
the Purser, who has dutifully 
danced with every woman and 
now feels that he owes him- 
self the rest of the night. He 
is d[uite a good dancer, for 
an old man. 

Oh, and there is usually 
Mrs. Grew, too — but she isn’t 
one of the chaperones and she 
is always nice to Girdie. She 
is a fat old woman, full of sin 
and chuckles. She doesn’t ex- 
pect anyone to dance with her 
but she likes to watch. And 
the officers who aren’t 
dancing at the moment like to 
sit with her; she’s furi.

About one o’clock Uncle 
Tom sends Clark to tell me 
to Come to bed or he’ll lock 
me out. He wouldn’t, but I do 
— my feet are tired. 

Good old Tricorn l

VI 

T HE Captain is slowly in- 
creasing the spin of the 
ship to make the fake gravity 
match the surface gravitation 
of Venus, which is 84% of 
one standard gravity or more 
than twice as much as I have 
been used to all my life. So, 
when I am not busy studying 
astrogation or ship handling, 
I spend much of my time in 
the ship’s gymnasium. I want 
to garden myself for what is 
coming, for I have no inten- 
tion of being at a disadvan- 
tage on. Venus in either 
strength or, agility. 

If I can adjust to an ac- 
celeration of 0.87 gee, the 
later transition to the full 
Earth-normal of one gee 
should be sugar pie with 
chocolate frosting. So I think. 

I usually have the gymnasi- 
um all to myself. Most of the 
passengers are Earthmen or 
Venusmen who feel no need 
to prepare for the heavy 
gravitation of Venus. Of the 
dozen-odd Marsmen I am the 
only one who seems to take 
seriously the cpming burden. 
The handful of aliens that gre • 
aboard the ship with us we 
never see; $ach ~ "mains in his

. * • t 


use the gym. Some of them 
are quite fanatic about keep- 
ing fit. But they use it mostly 
at hours when passengers are 
not likely to use it. 

So, on this day (Ceres thir- 
teenth actually but the Tri- 
corn uses Earth dates and 
time, which made it March 
ninth. I don’t mind the 
strange dates but the short 
Earth day is costing me a 
half-hour’s sleep each night) 
— on Ceres thirteenth I went/ 
charging into the gym, so an- 
gry 1 could spit venom and 
intending to derive a double 
benefit by working off my 
mad (at least to the point 
where I would not be clapped 
in irons for assault), and by 
strengthening my muscles, 
too. 

And found Clark inside, 
dressed in shorts and a massy 
bar bell. 

I stopped short and blurted 
out, “What are you doing 
here?’’ 

He grunted, “Weakening 
my mind.” 

Well, I had asked for it. 
There is no ship’s regulation 
forbidding Clark to use the 
v gym. His answer made sense 
to one schooled in his devious 
logic, which I certainly 
should be. I changed the sub- 
ject, tossed aside my robe and 
started limbering exercises to 
warm ; up. “How massy?” I 
asked. 

“Sixty 'kilos.” 

* * J ’ * «• ■ > ( t «. | 

I glancecLat a weight meter

tions of standard gee. It read 
“52%.” I did a fast rough in 
my mind — fifty-two thirty- 
sevenths of sixty — or unit 
sum, plus nine hundred over 
thirty-seven, so add about a 
ninth, top and bottom for a 
thousand over forty, to yield 
twenty-five. .call it the same 
as lifting eighty-five kilos 
back home on Mars. ‘‘Then 
why are you sweating ?” 

“I am not sweating !” He 
put the bar bell down. “Let’s 
see you lift* it.” 

“All right.” As he moved I 
squatted down to raise the 
bar bell — and changed my 
mind. 

N OW, believe me, I work 
out regularly with ninety 
kilos at home and I had been 
checking that weight meter 
on the wall each day and load- 
ing that same bar bell to 
match the weight I use at 
home, plus a bit extra each 
day. My objective (hopeless, 
it is beginning to seem) is 
eventually to lift as much 
mass under Venus conditions 
as I had been accustomed to 
lifting at home. 

So I was certain I could 
lift sixty kilos at 52% of 
standard gee. 

But it is a mistake for a 
girl to beat a male at any test 
of physical strength . even 
when it's your brother. Most 
especially when it's your 
brother, and he has a fiendish 
disposition and you’ve sud- 
denly had a glimmering of a 
way to put his fiendish pro- 

50 


clivities to work. As I have 
said, if you’re in a mood to 
hate something or somebody, 
Clark is the perfect partner. 

So I grunted and strained, 
making a good show, got it up 
to my chest, started it on up 
— and squeaked, “Help me!” 

Clark gave a one-handed 
push at the center of the bar 
and we got it all the way up. 
Then I said, “Catch for me,” 
through clenched teeth, and 
he eased it down. I sighed. 
“Gee, Clark, you must be get- 
ting awful strong.” 

“Doing all right.” 

It works. Clark was now as 
mellow as his nature permits. 
I suggested companion tum- 
bling... if he didn’t mind be- 
ing the bottom half of the 
team? — because I wasn’t sure 
I could hold him, not at point- 
five-two gee. .did he mind? 

He didn’t mind at all; it 
gave him another chance to 
be muscular and masculine — 
and I was certain he could 
lift me; I massed eleven kilos 
less than the bar bell he had 
just been lifting. When he 
was smaller, we used to do 
quite a bit of it, with me lift- 
ing him. It was a way to keep 
him quiet when. I was in 
charge of him. Now that he 
is as big as I am (and strong- 
er, I fear), we still tumble a 
little, but taking turns at the 
ground and air parts — back 
home, I mean. 

But with my weight almost 
half again what it ought to be 
I didn’t risk any fancy capers. 
Presently, when he had me in 

by Robert A. Heinlein 



a simple handstand over his 
head, I broached the subject 
on my mind. “Clark, is Mrs. 
Royer any special friend of 
yours ?” 

“Her?” He snorted and add- 
ed a rude noise. “Why?” 

“I just wondered. She — 
Mmm, perhaps I shouldn't re- 
peat it.” 

He said, “Look, Pod, you 
want me to leave you stand- 
ing on the ceiling?” 

“Don't you dare!” 

“Then don't start to say 
something and not finish it.” 

“All right. But steady while 
I swing my feet down to your 
shoulders.” He let me do so, 
then I hopped down to the 
floor. The worst part about 
high acceleration is not how 
much you weigh, though that 
is bad enough, but how fast 
you fall. And I suspected that 
Clark was quite capable of 
leaving me head downwards 
high in the air if I annoyed 
him. 

“What's this about Mrs. 
Royer?”. 

“Oh, nothing much. She 
thinks Marsmen are trash, 
that's all.” 

“She does, huh? That makes 
it mutual.” 

“Yes. She thinks it's dis- 
graceful that the Line allows 
us to travel first class — and 
the Captain certainly ought 
not to allow us to eat in the 
same mess with decent peo- 
ple.” 

“Tell me more.” 

“Nothing to tell. We're riff- 
raff, that's all. Convicts, you 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


know.” 

“Interesting. Very, very in- 
teresting.” 

“And her friend Mrs. Gar- 
cia agrees with her. But I 
suppose I shouldn't have re- 
peated it. After all, they are 
entitled to their own opinions. 
Aren't they?” 

Clark didn't answer, which 
is a very bad sign. Shortly 
thereafter he left without a 
word. In a sudden panic that 
I might have started more 
than I intended to, I called 
after him but he just kept 
going. Clark is not hard of 
hearing, but he can be very 
hard of listening. 

W ELL, it was too late now. 

So I put on a weight har- 
ness, then loaded myself 
down all over until I weighed 
as much as I would on Venus 
and started trotting on the 
treadmill until I was covered 
with sweat and ready for a 
bath and a change. 

Actually I did not really 
care what bad luck overtook 
those two harpies. I simply 
hoped that Clark's sleight-of- 
hand would be up to its usual 
high standards so that it 
could not possibly be traced 
back to him. Nor even guessed 
at. For I had not told Clark 
half of what was said. 

Believe you me, I had nev- 
er guessed, until we were in 
the Tricorn, that anyone 
could despise other persons 
simply over their ancestry or 
where they lived. Oh, I had 
encountered tourists from 

51 



Earth whose manners left 
something to be desired. But 
Daddy had told me that all 
tourists, everywhere, seem ob- 
noxious simply because tour- 
ists are strangers who do not 
know local customs. .and I 
believed it, because Daddy is 
never wrong. Certainly the 
occasional visiting professor 
that Daddy brought home for 
dinner was always charming, 
which proves that Earthmen 
do not have to have bad man- 
ners. 

I had noticed that the pas-, 
sengers in the Tricorn seemed 
a little bit stand-offish when 
we first boarded, but I did not 
think anything of it. After 
all, strangers do not run up 
and kiss you, even on Mars — 
and we Marsmen are fairly 
informal, I suppose; we’re 
still a frontier society. Be- 
sides that, most passengers 
had been in the ship at least 
from Earth. They had already 
formed their friendships and 
cliques. We were like new 
kids in* a strange school. 

But I said, “Good morn- 
ing!” to anyone I met in the 
passageway. If I was not an- 
swered I just checked it off 
to hard-of-hearing — so many 
of them obviously could be 
hard of hearing. Anyhow, I 
wasn’t terribly interested in 
getting chummy with passen- 
gers. I wanted to get ac- 
quainted with the ship’s of- 
ficers, pilot officers especial- 
ly, so that I could get some 
practical experience to chink 
in Vvhat I altekily * khew :f rom

reading. It’s not easy for a 
girl to get accepted for pilot 
training ; she has to be about 
four times as good as a male 
candidate — and every little 
bit helps. 

I got a wonderful break 
right away- — we were seated 
at the Captain’s table! 

Uncle Tom, of course. I am 
not conceited enough to think 
that “Miss Podkayne Fries, 
Marsopolis” means anything 
on a ship’s passenger list (but 
wait ten years !) — whereas 
Uncle Tom, even though he 
is just my pinochle-playing, 
easy-going oldest relative, is 
nevertheless senior Senator- 
at-Large of the Republic, and 
it is certain that the Marsopo- 
lis General Agent for the Tri- 
angle Line knows this. No 
doubt the agent would see to 
it that the purser of the Tri- 
corn would know it if he 
didn’t already. 

As may be. I am not one 
to scorn gifts from heaven, 
no matter how they arrive. At 
our very first meal I started 
working on Captain Darling. 
That really is his name, Bar- 
rington Babcock Darling — 
and does his wife call him 
“Baby Darling”? 

But of course a captain 
does not have a name aboard 
ship. He is “the Captain,” 
“the Master,” “the Skipper” 
or even “the Old Man” if ^t 
is a member of the ship’s 
company speaking pot in his 
august presence. But never a 
name : — simply a majestic, fig- 
ure of impersonal authority. 

by Robert A. Heinleip 



(I wonder if I will some- 
day be called “the Old Wom- 
an” when I am not in ear- 
shot ? Somehow it doesn’t 
sound quite the same.) 

C APTAIN Darling is not 
too majestic nor imper- 
sonal with me. I set out to 
impress him with the idea 
that I was awfully sweet, 
even younger than I am, ter- 
ribly impressed by him, over- 
awed. .and not too bright. It 
does not do to let a male of 
any age know that one has 
brains, not on first acquain- 
tance. Intelligence in a wom- 
an is likely to make a man 
suspicious and uneasy, much 
like Caesar’s fear of Cassius’s 
“lean and hungry look.” Get 
a man solidly on your side 
first. After that it is fairly 
safe to let him become grad- 
ually aware of your intellect 
— he may even feel uncon- 
sciously that it rubbed off 
from his own. 

So I set out to make him 
feel that it was a shame that 
I was not his daughter. (For- 
tunately he only has sons.) 
Before that first meal was 
over I confided in him my 
great yearning to take pilot 
training . suppressing, of 
course, any higher ambition. 

Both Uncle Tom and Clark 
could see what I was up to. 
But Uncle Tom would never 
give me away and Clark just 
looked bored and contemptu- 
ous and said nothing, because 
Clark would hot bother to in- 
terfere with Armageddon un- 

PODKAYNE of MAris 


less there was ten per cent in 
it for him. 

But I do not mind what my 
relatives think of my tactics; 
they work. Captain Darling 
was obviously amused at my 
grandiose and “impossible” 
ambition. .but he offered to 
show me the control room. 

Round one to Poddy, on 
points. 

I am now the unofficial 
ship’s mascot, with free run 
of the control room. And I 
am almost as privileged in the 
engineering department. Of 
course the Captain does not 
really want to spend hours 
teaching me the practical side 
of astrogation. He did show 
me through the control room 
and gave me a kindergarten 
explanation of the work — 
which I followed with wide- 
eyed awe — but his interest in 
me is purely social. He wants 
to not-quite hold me in his 
lap (he is much too practical 
and too discreet to do any- 
thing of the sort!) — so I not- 
quite let him and make it a 
point to keep up my social 
relations with him, listening 
with my best astonished-kit- 
ten look to his anecdotes 
while he feeds me liters of 
tea. I really am a good listen- 
er because you never can tell 
when you will pick up some- 
thing useful. And all in the 
world any woman has to do 
to be considered “charming” 
by men is to listen while they 
talk. 

But Captain Darling is not 
the only astrogator aboard.

He gave me the run of the 
control room; I did the rest. 
The second officer, Mr. Sav- 
vonavong, thinks it is simply 
amazing how fast I pick up 
mathematics. You see, he 
thinks he taught me differen- 
tial equations. Well, he did, 
when it comes to those awful- 
ly complicated ones used in 
correcting the vector of a 
constant-boost ship, but if I 
hadn’t worked hard in the 
supplementary course I was 
allowed to take last semester, 
I wouldn't know what he was 
talking about. Now he is 
showing me how to program 
a ballistic computer. 

The junior third, Mr. 
Clancy, is still studying for 
his unlimited license, so he 
has all the study tapes and 
reference books I need and is 
just as helpful. He is near 
enough my age to develop 
groping hands. .but only a 
very stupid male will make 
even an indirect pass unless 
a girl manages to let him 
know that it won’t be resent- 
ed. Mr. Clancy is not stupid 
and I am very careful to offer 
no opportunity. 

I may kiss him — two min- 
utes before I leave the ship 
for the last time. Not sooner. 

They are all very helpful 
and they think it is cute of 
me to be so dead serious about 
it. But, in truth, practical as- 
trogation is much harder than 
I had ever dreamed. 

I had guessed that part of 
the resentment I sensed — 
resentment that I could not 


fail to notice despite my 
cheery “Good mornings !” — 
lay in the fact that we were 
at the Captain’s table. To be 
sure, the “Welcome in the 
Tricorn!” booklet in each 
stateroom states plainly that 
new seating arrangements are 
made at each port and that 
it is the ship’s custom to 
change the guests at the Cap- 
tain’s table each time, making 
the selections from the new 
passengers. 

But I don’t suppose that 
warning makes it any pleas- 
anter to be bumped. I don’t 
expect to like it when I'm 
bumped off the Captain's ta- 
ble at Venus. 

But that is only part of the 
trouble. 

Only three of the passen- 
gers were really friendly to 
me : Mrs. Grew, Girdie and 
Mrs. Royer. Mrs. Royer I met 
first and at first I thought 
that I was going to like her, 
in a bored sort of way, as she 
was awfully friendly and I 
have great capacity for en- 
during boredom if it suits my 
purpose. I met her in the 
lounge the first day. She im- 
mediately caught my eye, 
smiled, invited me to sit by 
her and quizzed me about my- 
self. 

I answered her questions, 
mostly. I told her that Daddy 
was a teacher and that Moth- 
er was raising babies and that 
my brother and I were travel- 
ing with our uncle. I didn't 
boast about our family. Boast- 
ing is not polite and it often

is not believed — far better to 
let people find out nice 
things on their own and hope 
they won’t notice any unnice 
things. Not that there is any- 
thing unnice about Daddy and 
Mother. 

I told her that my name 
was Poddy Fries. 

“‘Poddy’?” she said. “I 
thought I saw something else 
on the passenger list.” 

“Oh. It’s really ‘Pod- 
kayne,’ ” I explained. “For 
the Martian saint, you know.” 
But she didn’t know. She 
answered, “It seems very odd 
to give a girl a man’s name.” 
Well, my name is odd, even 
among Marsmen. But not for 
that reason. “Possibly,” I 
agreed. “But with Martians 
gender is rather a matter of 
opinion, wouldn’t you say?” 
She blinked. 

I started to explain how a 
Martian doesn’t select which 
of three sexes to be until just 
before it matures. .and how, 
even so, the decision is opera- 
tive only during a relatively 
short period of its life. 

But I gave up, as I could 
see that I was talking to a 
blank wall. Mrs. Royer sim- 
ply could not imagine any 
pattern other than her own. 
So I shifted quickly. “Saint 
Podkayne lived a very long 
time ago. Nobody actually 
knows whether the saint was 
male or female. There are just 
traditions.” 

i 

O F course the traditions 
are pretty explicit and 
many living Martians claim 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


descent from Saint Podkayne. 
Daddy says that we know 
Martian history of millions of 
years ago much more accu- 
rately than we know human 
history a mere two thousand 
years ago. In any case most 
Martians include “Podkayne” 
in their long lists of names 
(practically genealogies in 
synopsis) because of the tra- 
dition that anyone named for 
Saint Podkayne can call on 
him (or “her” —or “it”) in 
time of trouble. 

As I have said. Daddy is ro- 
mantic and he thought it 
would be nice to give a baby 
the luck, if any, that is at- 
tached to the saint’s name. I 
am neither romantic nor su- 
perstitious. But it suits me 
just fine to have a name that 
belongs to me and to no other 
human. I like being Podkayne 
“Poddy” Fries. It’s better 
than being one of a multitude 
of Elizabeths or Dorothys or 
such. 

Anyway, I like it. 

But I could see that it sim- 
ply puzzled Mrs. Royer, so 
we passed to other matters. 
Speaking from her seniority 
as an “old space hand” based 
on her one just-completed 
trip out from Earth, she told 
me a great many things about 
ships and space travel. Most 
of them weren’t so, but I in- 
dulged her. She introduced 
me to a number of people and 
handed me a large quantity of 
gossip about passengers, 
ship’s officers, et cetera. Be- 
tween times she filled me in 

55 



on her aches, pains and symp- 
toms, what an important ex- 
ecutive her son was, what a 
very important person her 
late husband had been and 
how, when I reached Earth, 
she really must see to it that 
I met the Right People. “Per- 
haps such things don’t matter 
in an outpost like Mars, my 
dear child, but it is Terribly 
Important to get Started 
Right in New York.” 

I tabbed her as garrulous, 
stupid and well intentioned. 

But I soon found that I 
couldn’t get rid of her. If I 
passed through the lounge— 
which I had to do in order to 
reach the control room — she 
would snag me and I couldn’t 
get away short of abrupt rude- 
ness or flat lies. 

She quickly started using 
me for chores. “Podkayne 
darling, would you mind just 
slipping around to my state- 
room and fetching my mauve 
wrap? I feel a tiny chill. It’s 
on the bed I think, or perhaps 
in the wardrobe — that’s a 
dear.” Or, “Poddy child, I’ve 
rung and I’ve rung and the 
stewardess simply won’t an- 
swer. Would you get my book 
and my knitting? Oh, and 
while you’re at it, you might 
bring me a nice cup of tea 
from the pantry.” 

Those things aren’t too bad ; 
she is probably creaky in the 
knees and I’m not. But it went 
on endlessly. .and shortly, in 
addition to being her personal 
stewardess, I was her private 
nurse. First she asked me to 


read her to sleep. “Such a 
blinding headache and your 
voice is so soothing, my 
sweet.” 

I read to her for an hour 
and then found myself rub- 
bing her head and temples for 
almost as long. Oh well, a per- 
son ought to manage a little 
kindness now and then, just 
for practice. And Mother 
sometimes has dreadful head- 
aches when she has been work- 
ing too hard; I know that a 
rub does help. 

That time she tried to tip 
me. I refused it. She insisted. 
“Now, now, child, don’t argue 
with your Aunt Flossie.” 

I said, “No really, Mrs. 
Royer. If you want to give it 
to the fund for disabled 
spacement as a thank-you, 
that’s all right. But I can’t 
take it. 

She said pish and tosh and 
tried to shove it into my 
pocket. So I slid out and went 
to bed. 

1 didn’t see her at breakfast ; 

she always has a tray in her 
room. But about midmorning 
a stewardess told me that 
Mrs. Royer wanted to see me 
in her room. I was hardly 
gruntled at the summons, as 
Mr. Sawonavong had told me 
that if I showed up just be- 
fore ten during his watch, I 
could watch the whole process 
of a ballistic correction and 
he would explain the steps to 
me. If she wasted more than 
five minutes of my time, I 
would be late.

But I called on her. She 
was as cheery as ever. “Oh, 
there you are, darling! I’ve 
been waiting ever so long! 
That stupid stewardess. Pod- 
dy dear, you did such wonders 
for my head last night... and 
this morning I find that I’m 
positively cripple d with my 
back— you can’t imagine, 
dear; it’s ghastly ! Now if 
you’ll just be an angel and 
give me a few minutes mas- 
sage — oh, say a half hour— I’m 
sure it’ll do wonder for me. 
You’ll find the cream for it 
over there on the dressing ta- 
ble, I think. .and now if 
you’ll just help me — ” 

“Mrs. Royer.” 

“Yes, dear? The cream is in 
that big pink tube. Use just- — ” 

• /‘Mrs. Royet, I canT do it. 
I have an appointment/’ 

“What, dear? Oh, t6sh, let 
‘ them wait. No one is ever on 
time aboard ship. Perhaps you 
had ^better warm your hands 
before — ” ' ' * ■ 

“Mrs. Royer, I am not go-

^shouldn’t .touch it. I might in- 
jure you. -B.ut I’ll take a mes- 
> sage to the Surgeon! if you 
- like and ask him. to come see 
you.” 

Suddenly she wasn’t at all 
cheery. “You mean you won't 
do it!” 

“Have it your way. Shall I 
tell the Surgeon ?” > 

“Why, you impertinent — 
Get out of here!” : 

T : got. •’’< *• » • • • 1 ■' 1 : 

I met her in a 1 passageway 

PODKAYNE OF MARS 


on my way to lunch. She 
stared straight through me, so 
I didn’t speak either. She was 
walking as nimbly as I was; I 
guess her back had taken a 
turn for the better. I saw her 
twice more that day and twice 
more she simply couldn’t see 
me. 

The following morning I 
was using the viewer in the 
lounge to scan one of Mr. 
Clancy’s study tapes, one on 
radar approach & contact. The 
viewer is off in a corner, be- 
hind a screen of fake potted 
palms, and perhaps they 
didn’t notice me. Or perhaps 
they didn’t care. 

I stopped the scan to give 
my eyes and ears a rest, and 
heard Mrs. Garcia talking to 
Mrs. Royer : » 

“ — that I simply can’t stand 
about Mars is ( that it is so 
commercialized. Why couldn’t 
they , have, Ipft i.t primitive 
and beautiful?’’ , 

Mrsw Royer ; “What . can 
you expect ? , Those , dxeadful 
people!” : ", , ■- i . 

The ship’s official language 
is Ortho: but many passengers 
talk English among • them- 
selves-^-and often act as if no 
one else could possibly under- 
stand it. These two weren’t 
keeping their voices down. I 
went on listening. 

Mrs. Garcia: “Just what I 
was saying to Mrs. Rimski. 
After all, they’re all crimi- 
nals.” 

Mrs* Royer : “Or > worse. 

Have you noticed that little 
Martian girl ? The niece-*-or 

$7 



so they clainvr-of that big 
black savage?” 

> • 

I counted ten backwards in 
Old Martian and reminded 
myself of the penalty for mur- 
der. I didn’t mind being called 
a “Martian.” They didn’t 
know any better and, anyhow, 
it’s no insult ; the Martians 
were civilized before humans 
learned to walk. But “big 
black savage”! Uncle Tom is 
as dark as I am blonde; his 
Maori blood and desert tan 
make him the color of beauti- 
ful old leather. .and I love 
the way he looks. As for the 
rest — he is learned and civil- 
ized and gentle... and highly 
honored wherever he goes. 

Mrs. Garcia: “I’ve seen her. 
Common, I would say. Flashy 
but cheap. A type that attracts 
a certain sort of man.” 

Mrs. Royer: “My dear, you 
don’t know the half of it. I’ve 
tried to help her. I really felt 
sorry for her, and I always be- 
lieve in being gracious, espe- 
cially to one’s social infe- 
riors.” 

Mrs. Garcia: “Of course, 
dear.” 

Mrs. Royer: “I tried to give 
her a few hints as to proper 
conduct among gentle people. 
Why, I was even paying her 
for little trifles, so that she 
wouldn’t be uneasy among her 
betters. But she’s an utterly 
ungrateful little snip. She 
thought . she could squeeze 
moire money out of me. She 
was rude about it, so rude that 
I feared for my safety.' I had 

56 


to order her out of my room, 
actually.” 

Mrs. Garcia : “You were 
wise to drop her. Blood will 
tell. Bad blood or good blood, 
blood will always tell. And 
mixed blood is the Very 
Worst Sort. Criminals to 
start with... and then that 
Shameless Mixing of Races. 
You can see it right in that 
family. The boy doesn’t look 
a bit like his sister, and as for 
the uncle — Hmmm. .my 
dear, you half way hinted at 
something. Do you suppose 
that she is not his niece but 
something, shall we say, a bit 
closer?” 

“I wouldn't put it past ei- 
ther one of them!” 

“Oh, come, ’fess up, Flossie. 
Tell me what you found out.” 

Mrs. Royer : “I didn’t say a 
word. But I have eyes — and so 
have you.” 

Mrs. Garcia: “Right in 

front of everyone!” 

Mrs. Royer : “What I can't 
understand is why the Line 
permits them to mix with us . 
Perhaps they have to sell them 
passage — treaties or some 

such n o n s. e,n s e — but we 
shouldn’t be forced to asso- 
ciate with them... and cer- 
tainly not to eat with them!” 

Mrs. Garcia: “I know. I'm 
going to write a very strong 
letter about it as soon as I get 
home. There are limits. You 
know, I had thought that Cap- 
tain Darling was a gentleman 
. .but when I saw those crea- 
tures actually seated at the 
Captain’s table — well, I didn’t

believe my eyes. I thought I 
would faint,” 

Mrs. Royer. “I know. But 
after all, the Captain does 
come from Venus.” 

Mrs. Garcia: “Yes, but Ve- 
nus was never a prison colony. 
That boy. .he sits in the very 
chair I used to sit in, right 
across from the Captain.” 

(I made a mental note to ask 
the Chief steward for a dif- 
ferent chair for Clark; I 
didn’t want him contaminat- 
ed.) 

A FTER that they dropped 

us “Martians” and started 
dissecting Girdie and com- 
plaining about the food and 
the service, and even stuck 
pins in some of their ship- 
board coven who weren’t 
present. But I didn’t listen. I 
simply kept quiet and prayed 
for strength to go on doing so 
— because if I had made my 


presence known I feel sure 
that I would have stabbed 
them both with their own 
knitting needles. 

Eventually they left, to rest 
a while to fortify themselves 
for lunch. I rushed out and 
changed into my gym suit and 
hurried to the gymnasium to 
work up a good sweat instead 
of engaging in violent crime. 

It was there that I found 
Clark and told him just 
enough— or maybe a little bit 
too much, 

Mr. Savvonavong had told 
me that we were likely to 
have a radiation storm almost 
any time. The solar weather 
station on Mercury reported 
“flare” weather shaping up 
and warned all ships in space 
to be ready for it. I knew that 
when I told Clark, but I 
didn’t think there would be 
any connection. 

I was wrong.

“Fifteen!” exclaimed Smith, 
“The rich get richer and the 
poor stay poor.” 

“The wallpape r,” Stahl 
smoothly proceeded, “is a rep- 
lica of Italian murals. If you 
adjust your focus properly the 
flat columns become solids 
through the art of vanishing- 
point perspective.” 

“Excellent period distortion 
of Greek styles,” said Tinker, 
studying the columns. “And 
those three chairs are fine 
copies of Chippendale. You’re 
to be complimented on your 
taste in everything, Stahl.” 

“You really know ancient 
designs,” Stahl said. “Genuine 
old copies are even scarcer 
than their originals. And orig- 
inals, of course, can never be 
quite as good,” 

“Sometimes I don’t see 
why,” Smith muttered. 

They all looked shocked. 
“Smith, you need a checkup,” 
Tinker advised. “You sound 
rundown. How can we prog- 
ress without imitating past 
achievements ?” 

“A little rundown,” Smith 
admitted, “but... Oh, let’s 
forget it.” 

“Let’s,” Stahl nodded, striv- 
ing to recapture the pair’s at- 
tention as they went on 
through the Suite. “Notice the 
paintings. Those two are ex- 
cellent pseudo-Braques and in 
the last room were fine fakes 
of Van Gogh, Picasso and 
Chardin. In fact,” he pointed 
toward a Gauguin-like nude, 
all flattened sensuousness, 
“that one’s as close to a real 


Gauguin as an imitation can 
go without being a mere re- 
production.” 

They all gasped and even 
Smith shook his head rever- 
ently. “To be that close to the 
real thing! It’s all you’d ever 
need.” 

“Becoming more possible all 
the time.” Tinker grinned sug- 
gestively at Mrs. Stahl. She 
looked back, mildly interested. 
“We’ll get there eventually.” 

Happily oblivious to every- 
thing but his collections, 
Stahl led them into the li- 
brary. One wall, covered with 
rows of book spines, swung 
around to reveal a well- 
stocked bar. There was also 
a large bar across the room 
which quickly became a li- 
brary of real books and re- 
cording systems. 

“I’m not much for eating 
and drinking,” Smith protest- 
ed feebly. 

“Who is?” Mrs. Stahl 
laughed. “But this must be a 
special occasion for you.” 

Eyes bulging nervously. 
Smith ran his fingers through 
his luxuriant hair and sighed, 
“Special it is. All right.” 

Stahl casually mixed drinks 
for them all and sipped an 
Old Fashioned. “I’ve concen- 
trated somewhat more on the 
twentieth century of the Old 
Times than any other,” he 
said. “A particularly intri- 
guing century, I find, al- 
though not crucial like the 
twenty-first, of course.” 

“The crucial one,” Tinker 
protested. 


THE REAL THING 


61 



‘'As a fellow antiquarian/ 1 
must beg to differ, sir.” 

"What about rocket travel, 
Mr. Stahl? When did that be- 
gin?” 

"Old hat,” he yawned. 

"And atomic energy?” 

"Same applies there. Look, 
Tinker, don’t get me wrong. 
I love the period. But, objec- 
tively viewed, the twenty- 
first makes the great differ- 
ence.” 

"And what about duplica- 
tion of life functions, like the 
mechanical heart? That really 
got started in the twentieth.” 

"Absolutely right,” Smith 
nodded vigorously. 

"All strictly mechanical,” 
Stahl sighed. "But the twen- 
ty-first turned the study of 
pain and pleasure itself from 
an art into a true science.” 

"No, no,” scoffed the cyber- 
neticist. 

Stahl pounded the bar. "All 
right. I’m going to prove it 
by putting on an All-Sense 
Feeliescope of Thomas Dyall. 
It’s fully sense-adapted, so 
it should pick up perfectly.” 

"Hope it isn’t noisy,” said 
Smith. 

"It’s beautiful answered 
Mary Stahl. "I could listen to 
it all day.” 

The odor of damp, new- 
mown grass filled the room 
and another more elusive 
scent mingled with it. Entry 
of June 3rd , 2068, said an im- 
personal, mechanical voice, 
from the journal of Thomas 
Dyall, elected World's First 

62 


Poet Laureate in 2089 . A 
warm rich bass took over: 

This morning I rode far 
out to reach open coun- 
tryside in the preserved 
areas to replenish my 
stock of sensory experi- 
ences. As I was walking 
along through the woods, 
the most delicious scent 
struck my nostrils. I 
immediately recognized 
new-mown grass in it but 
the factor making the 
true difference escaped 
me until I realized the 
faint odor belonged to 
roses. At r that point, my 
senses reeling with de- 
light, I composed in my 
mind most of my long 
poem, The Nature of Na- 
ture , grasping intuitively 
an experience more in- 
tense, more valuable, than 
any "real” one. I say in- 
tuitively because I still 
thought the odor was 
merely that of grass and 
roses. A minute after- 
wards, though, I came 
into a clearing, spotted a 
forest ranger’s cottage 
there and discovered that 
the scent was from a re- 
cently-improved insecti- 
cide that the ranger’s 
wife was using in the liv- 
ing room. There was lit- 
tle grass in the area and 
not a single rose! 

The following note, inter- 
rupted the monotone voice, 

by Albert Teichner 



was added by the author in 
the year 2116 : 

Here in “real” life the 
great guiding principle 
of my future was brought 
home to me. The well- 
done imitation of a thing 
was better than the thing 
itself! This was the les- 
son I had to disseminate 
for all humanity. 

“Interesting,” Tinker said, 
“although we all know now 
that one thing cannot be sub- 
stituted for. Also — ” 

“No discussion now,” 
pleaded Smith. “You need a 
while to consider all that. 
Anyway, I’ve been thinking 
about your bill, Stahl. That 
wasn’t a fold on Washington’s 
eyelid, just a tiny inkstain. 
It’s genuine” 

“It can’t be,” Stahl snapped 
and angrily led them back to 
the first room. “Tinker, I 
want you as my witness.” 

He handed the bill around 
and Smith had to concede it 
was really counterfeit. 
“What’s that next one?” he 
asked. 

“A ten.” Stahl hesitated, 
then took it off the pile along 
with three others and passed 
them to the visitors, showing 
off fine points of imitation. 
When he collected the bills 
he carefully made certain 
there were still five and 
locked them up again. 

“What about another 
drink?” Smith asked hastily. 
“No.” Tinker sat down in a 


large chair. “Let’s straighten 
out something right now, 
Stahl. Dyall was making the 
first crude statement of an 
obvious truth. If we have a 
pleasant sensation it doesn’t 
matter whether it’s caused by 
a rose or a chemical imitation 
of a rose or by making a brain 
imagine a rose — doesn’t mat- 
ter except that the real rose 
itself is the hardest thing to 
control. So it can’t be as in- 
tensely real as its imitations.” 

“Mr. Tinker, isn’t that cru- 
cial enough for you?” Mrs. 
Stahl asked. Her voice was so 
rich and warmly rounded that 
Smith stared wonderingly at 
her, as if trying to fathom an 
alien tongue. 

“Not quite,” Tinker 
shrugged. “Stahl, you’re dis- 
cussing the smallest aspect of 
the three-part equation, Stim- 
ulus -{- Stimulated Body = 
Experience. Your poet was 
saying certain changes in 
Stimulus would still give a 
Stimulated Body the same 
Experience as the original. 
But the philosophers and cy- 
berneticists, they already sus- 
pected something more radi- 
cal. If the Stimulated Body 
was properly changed the 
same Stimulus could give dif- 
ferent Bodies the same Ex- 
perience. In other words, a 
properly-arranged process 
would have the same Experi- 
ence as the life function 
for which it was substituted.” 

“Now then,” he went on, 
“all life reproduces itself, 
right? Well, they finally fig- 

63 


THE REAL THING 



ured the most important 
thing to reproduce was a 
man’s Experience itself, not 
any particular form of Stim- 
ulated Body. Of course we 
have higher ideals. We want 
the Stimulated Body to be as 
nearly like what it was as 
possible — then we can have 
the best of all possible 
worlds.” 

“Some people,” Smith grum- 
bled, “don’t get their fair 
share of that best.” 

“Anyway I hate all theo- 
ries,” said Mrs. Stahl. 

Stahl disregarded them as 
he stared at his cashbox. “My 
money,” he said ominously, 
“has been changed!” 

The two visitors exchanged 
nervous glances. “That’s not 
possible,” said Tinker. 

“It is. Somebody’s palmed a 
real one as a substitute!” 
“That’s very unfair,” Smith 
protested. “We came here as 
guests, strangers to you and 
to each other. We’ve given 
you the correct degree of en- 
vious admiration and now you 
show your gratitude for our 
human reaction by saying 
we’re deranged!” 

Stahl was unmoved. “I still 
say it’s been stolen.” He 
opened the box. “See — the 
dollar’s different! When the 
people of the Old Times made 
us their heirs and children 
they left piles of this real 
stuff around along with al- 
most everything else they’d 
made. It’s practically worth- 
less !” 

Tinker frowned uncertain- 

64 


ly. “If it makes you feel bet- 
ter I’ll submit to a lie-detec- 
tor. I hope you’re capable of 
feeling shame when it proves 
my innocence !” 

“Good enough,” said Stahl, 
turning expectantly to his 
other guest. As he waited. 
Smith pulled back a little. 

“Well?” Mary smiled, mov- 
ing a little toward him. 

Smith leaped away from 
her, heading toward an open 
window, but the others moved 
faster and grabbed him before 
he reached the wall. 

“What’s the matter with 
you anyway?” Tinker grunt- 
ed, straining to hold him. 
“The window’s painted on the 
wall !” 

Smith slumped forward in 
despair as Stahl triumphantly 
wormed the valued counter- 
feit from his pocket. “I can’t 
do anything right,” Smith 
wailed. “I heard about this 
collection and thought I could 
manage to get one little thing 
for myself. I haven’t been 
given much else by life.” 

“You — you defective!” 
Stahl shouted. 

Smith only slumped further 
forward. “How can I help it? 
The Monte Carlo computer 
gave me one of the last places 
for advanced altering and I 
have to wait and wait. Com- 
pared to you, I’m still a half- 
breed !” 

“Don’t hand me that,” Stahl 
snapped. “I didn’t mean phys- 
ical defects. You look as nor- 
mal as anyone else.” 

“No, darling, I think he’s 

by Albert Teichner 



telling the truth,” Mary said 
sympathetically. “When alter- 
ing began it was only skin- 
deep for all of us.” 

“I’ll bet you’re sixty per 
cent altered already,” Smith 
cried out. “It’s my bad luck to 
be only twenty-five per cent 
so far. All I can do is look at 
her and wonder why the two 
of you make such a fuss.” 

The cyberneticist tried to 

calm him. “Your turn’s com- 

• _>» 
mg. 

“I have to find out what it’s 
about sooner than that!” 

Tinker sighed. “I’ll try to 
get your number advanced.” 

“Let him wait his turn,” 
Stahl said coldly. “He’s faking 
a lot anyway.” 

At that Smith broke free 
from them and pressed his 
back to the optical illusion 
window. “Don't come closer,” 
he warned. “I don’t have much 
to lose.” 

They stopped a few feet 
away and waited. Suddenly he 
raised his left hand to his face 
and dug the long nails in a 
semicircle into his flesh. As 
a thin stream of locally cir- 
culated blood gushed out, he 
dug deeper and the eyeball 
fell forward, quivering, on his 
cheek. 

“He was telling the truth!” 
Stahl gasped, pointing at the 
glittering metal bits within 
the eyesocket. A glowing wire 
was slowly evaporating on the 
retinal plate as optical feed- 
back collapsed.

Smith to a chair. “We’ll be 
able to repair you in a 
month,” he said, “because 
you’ve a simpler arrangement, 
and I can promise you’ll have 
as good an electro-chemical 
near-cortex as anybody. And 
the other more interesting 
changes too.” 

Stahl glanced at his wife, 
then, as she nodded back, 
slowly put his precious coun- 
terfeit into the dangling hand. 
He was pleased to see enough 
consciousness was still func- 
tioning enough for the fin- 
gers to close greedily around 
it. “Keep it,” he said, “you de- 
serve it more than me.” 

Suddenly he realised he was 
feeling not only shame but 
pity too! It was the first time 
for pity — and that meant he 
was one step further on his 
own journey. 

How far that journey had 
already taken him! For, when 
their brilliant labors had de- 
humanized them, the humans 
had possessed sufficient un- 
derstanding to pass the dead 
world on to the superior- wis- 
dom of their creations. If 
they had been unable to fore- 
see what would eventually 
happen, Stahl and his fellow 
robots could. Some day the su- 
preme knowledge and the su- 
preme feeling would be per- 
fectly wedded, the day they 
became truly humanoid copies 
of their makers. \ 

He moved forward, Tinker- 
following him, to help his fel~t 
low creature closer to thati 
common final destiny. ENP:

IF • Short Story 


THE 

RELUCTANT 

IMMORTALS 

There they were, on the 
threshhold of life — a 
life that might be un- 
bearably, terribly long! 

BY DAVID R. BUNCH 

S O they went on down 
there, with all along the 
big fat glove signs pointing 
at them, squirting — not blood 
— merely reminder in color, 
out of something like beet 
juice or wine — and the high- 
way signs saying constantly 
SLOW, SLOW DOWN, 


CURVE, CAREFUL, BE- 
WARE. They had the little 
metal teardrop held down at 
two hundred, just “cruising 
’er” on the nylon strip de- 
signed to hold them at four 
hundred, or, in emergency, 
better still. 

“I hope,” he said through 
his fine white-metal teeth, 
“that the quota is filled. So 
much to do tomorrow — and 
tomorrow.” 

“Yes!” she said through 
lips that had been sculpted 
by surgery until now they re- 
sembled a red rose bouquet, 
“so much to do— tonight !” 
She was his bride of five days. 

They rolled under the 
dancing signs where two su- 
per Whooshies crashed at 
each other on a ribbon-road 
of silk until legs and arms 
piled out and a red fluid filled 
the multiple lanes. She 
laughed low and chesty from 
a larynx that had been done 
in gold-x against cancer long 
ago and said, “What’ll they 
think of next to remind us? 
Too many of us now, heaven 
knows. But all the time they 
keep pleading with us not to 
kill ourselves.” 

“If we get by the quota,” 
he said, “sometime we’ll take 
a run across on that new Su- 
per they’re building in the 
north. They say they really 
got signs up there!” He eased 
the little Whooshie up to 
two-fifty and still they were 


66 



just crawling. Two super 
Speartakes, a dozen or so 
of the Flashbugs and a hun- 
dred Windstars swept past 
them as though they were 
standing aside. “ I want our 
next one to be a Caddiscat,” 
she said. “Everybody’s get- 
ting a Caddiscat.” 

He looked at her and 
thought he detected again 
something he had feared a 
long time ago, right at first, 
ten days ago, when it had 
started. But in the fogged 
flush of romance he had for- 
got. And now after the long 
five-day courtship they were 
bride and groom five days. 
And he had to admit that the 
nights had all been wonder- 
ful, with their great love be- 
tween them, and the novel 
gadgets and attachments they 
had both brought to the mar- 
riage, to stimulate and relax 
them together. But now that 
nagging doubt again as he 
looked at the rather grim set 
of the red roses that were her 
lips. Was she just another 
scheming, ambitious woman? 
He began to dream of a pos- 
sibility of her filling the 
quota, alone. And he felt 
guilty. But glancing at her as 
he expertly held the Whoo- 
shie to a curve above which 
two purple sign ambulances 
danced, he had to admit that 
after the fourth night, even 
with all the tricks, it had 
grown a little stale. 

“Hungry?” 

She bounced on her white- 
nyloned bottom in the little 

THE RELUCTANT IMMORTALS 


seat of the Whooshie. It was 
plain that his abrupt question 
had brought her back from a 
long way out. “No — no,” she 
stammered. “I couldn’t eat.” 
“What were you thinking 
of, so far away?” 

T HE roses climbed over 
each other for a little 
while like a pile of snakes as 
she licked her lips and could 
not speak. And when she said, 
“I was just thinking how aw- 
ful if they had took only one 
of us on the quota,” he wasn’t 
at all sure she was telling the 
truth. 

“Was he awfully interest- 
ing?” 

“Who?” 

“The one you were remem- 
bering, away out there.” 

The rose bouquet swirled 
and she was all woman when 
she said, “You are the most 
interesting I’ve ever met.” 
“Thanks,” he said. : 

“Not as many tricks, may- 
be. But what you do know, 
you know better.” 

“Gee, thanks!” he said. 

So the little Whooshie 
rolled on down toward the 
place where the quota was. 
The quota man for their dis- 
trict sat behind a bright 
orange desk, his horn-rims 
modern slant and jeweled 
very nicely. His chair was 
pale green. On his desk were 
objects of quaint joy — danc- 
ing flowers, little girls going 
to school, cats in the sun, 
barefoot boys in a melon 
patch, a mother spreading 

67 



rash powder on a dry diaper; 
above him his ceiling was all 
pink lights. 

‘‘We’re here about the 
quota,” the man said. “We got 
our notice for the quarterly 
check-in.” She nodded in 
agreement and her lips were 
a little scared. 

“Names?” 

He gave his name; she gave 
hers. Then the husband help- 
fully explained how the wife 
had changed her name but 
five days ago, and he told 
loud and clear what her old 
name had been. Perhaps she 
was on the list by her old 
name. 

“So you’re here about our 
Emergency Program quota?” 
The smile that flickered out 
and. the jut-jawed careful pose 
reminded a little of glory pic- 
ture^ there had once been of 
dictators in the. world. But his 
.eye,$ were smiling brightly, as 
he flicked the switch and the 
list climbed down the wall.. It 
was plain that he wished this 
to be, if not a time of joy, at 
least not a time of scenes, “It 
is much better than it used to 
be,” he said as. the list raced 
op in the wall viewer, “much 
changed. Some, people are 
volunteering now , for the 
Emergency: Program quota. 
To get a rest from a mate, to 
relax from a business, or doz- 
ens of other good reasons. 
And every volunteer, of 
course, releases a draftee.” He 
looked at them as if pleading 
for understanding.' “It’s con- 
gestion on the civil highways, 

68 


’ » • ’ i 

really, as much as the. avyful 
climb of the , rate that makes 
the Program, so necessary. So 
maybe when we get more 
highways things will be bet- 
ter. When the surface is till 
taken up, which it will be 
soon now, there’s no reason in 
the world we can’t go up- 
stairs with our tough light 
alloys and build any number 
of layers of highways. Fly- 
ing’s all right, rockets and all, 
but we’ll always need good old 
leisurely wheels down there 
zipping on terra firma.” He 
seemed to be .keeping up his 
patter to relax them. 

T HE list flowed on in the 
walk mile after mile of it, 
while they watched tensely 
but could not read the names 
moving swiftly. The quota 
man, not watching, twirled 
’ half ^circles on his green swiv- 
el, his finger tips, seeming vto 
meet around i.some very .defi- 
nite 3 ball of akv.Hi$v eyes, ^de- 
tached, were .loafing in some 
far country, but his attitude 
otherwise was one of .listen- 
ing casually ; as vhe* italked. on

had to be. * When the*, .sharp 
pheep came out of the wall, 
he stopped, the li§t at f opce. 
There* bracketed by. two 
green stars, was her name, her 
name of five . days ago. 
.“That’ll do . it for now,” he 
said, big-yoiced and .cheerful,

“Fills the qypt^l ^A^p^ntly

on a volunteer, ha ha. You see, 
I didn’t have to watch the list, 
because when you spoke your 
names, the list knew, ha ha.” 

When the screams broke 
from her lips and the roses 
writhed in torture, he took 
the necessary things from his 
desk drawer and raced to her. 
He had seen them do this be- 
fore, many times, usually 
from a lack of preparation and 
gross unfamiliarity with the 
Program. “It will be the most 
restful ten years of your life,” 
he insisted soothingly as he 
expertly pumped green fluid 
through a puncture he had 
made in her left arm. “And 
once a year,” he talked on as 
he soothed and petted her 
with the frozen relaxer pad, 
“usually in June, in our new 
improved system, we bring 
them back and allow them one 
visitor, the visitor of their 
choice, if possible. In a very 
private little cell for a full 
hour! Now, isn’t that fine?” 
His eyes leered at the hus- 
band. “Usually in cases like 
this there’s no doubt who the 
visitor will be. Unless of 
course he too has been draft- 
ed. But it’s just for the ten 
years, after all, and then 
someone else takes your place 
in this necessary rotation. So 
much better, we feel, than 
either of the other two possi- 
ble ways of solving the prob- 
lem — drastic regimentation of 
the rate or outright reduction 
through perma-rieep, ha ha. 
And, who knows, with the new 
building program and a fuller 

THE RELUCTANT IMMORTALS 


enlistment in Volunteers for 
Rate Control, we might be 
able to reduce the time.” 


T HEN, because of the rate, 
and the highway condition 
especially, he led her away, 
dazed and wooden now from 
the green fluid and the numb- 
ing relaxer pad. Her husband 
of five days, having escaped 
the draft by the grace of a 
volunteer, left fast in his lit- 
tle Whooshie. As he headed 
north toward the new Super, 
he waved vaguely in the direc- 
tion of the place where she 
would be for ten years. Actu- 
ally he was so tired of her al- 
ready that right now he 
doubted if he would ever be 
back. But up on the northern 
Super, and getting a little 
lonely, he decided it would 
probably be fun once a year to 
be able to go back and supple- 
ment other activities with a 
wife. But wait! Just as he was 
wheeling his Whooshie past 
an animated sign that showed 
two sports Caddiscats battling 
m boxing shorts the dread 
fear seized him anew. With 
the birth rate what it was and 
had been and with the high- 
ways becoming more and more 
congested all the time no 
doubt he too would soon be 
drafted into the Program. 
There, with the special fluids, 
to lie like an egg, like a cold 
stick of wood, like a dead man 
...for ten years. .m a y b e 
longer . maybe forever ... in 
the crowded earth’s Cold 
Storage Program! END

TO 




llT’M not at all sure,” Un- 
-A-der-Secretary Sternwheel- 
er said, “that I fully under- 
stand the necessity for your. • 
ah. .absenting yourself from 
your post of duty, Mr. Retief. 
Surely this matter could have 
been dealt with in the usual 
way — assuming any action is 
necessary.” 

“I had a sharp attack of 
writer’s cramp, Mr. Secre- 
tary,” Retief said. “So I 
thought I’d better come along 
in person — just to be sure I 
was positive of making my 
point.” 

“Eh?” 

“Why, ah, there were a 
number of dispatches,” Depu- 
ty Under-Secretary Magnan 
put in. “Unfortunately, this 
being end-of-the-fiscal-year 
time, we found ourselves quite 
inundated with reports. Re- 
ports, reports, reports — ” 

“Not criticizing the report- 
ing system, are you, Mr. Mag- 
nan?” the Under-Secretary 
barked. 

“Gracious, no,” Magnan 
said. “I love reports.” 

“It seems nobody's told the 
Aga Kagans about fiscal 
years,” Retief said. “They’re 
going right ahead with their 
program of land-grabbing on 
Flamme. So far, I’ve persuad- 
ed the Boyars that this is a 
matter for the Corps, and not 


to take matters into their own 
hands.” 

The Under-Secretary nod- 
ded. “Quite right. Carry on 
along the same lines. Now, if 
there’s nothing further — ” 
“Thank you, Mr. Secre- 
tary,” Magnan said, rising. 
“We certainly appreciate your 
guidance.” 

“There is a little something 
further,” said Retief, sitting 
solidly in his chair. “What’s 
the Corps going to do about 
the Aga Kagans?” 

The Under-Secretary turned 
a liverish eye on Retief. “As 
Minister to Flamme, you 
should know that the function 
of a diplomatic representative 
is merely to... what shall I 
say. ?” 

“String them along?” Mag- 
nan suggested. 

“An unfortunate choice of 
phrase,” the Under-Secretary 
said. “However, it embodies 
certain realities of Galactic 
politics. The Corps must con- 
cern itself with matters of 
broad policy.” 

“Sixty years ago the Corps 
was encouraging the Boyars 
to settle Flamme,” Retief 
said. “They were assured of 
Corps support.” 

“I don’t believe you’ll find 
that in writing,” said the Un- 
der-Secretary blandly. “In 
any event, that was sixty

years ago. At that time a foot- 
hold against Neo-Concordia- 
tist elements was deemed de- 
sirable. Now the situation has 
changed/' 

“The Boyars have spent 
sixty years terraforming 
FI amine,” Retief said. 
“They’ve cleared jungle, de- 
scummed the seas, irrigated 
deserts, set out forests. 
They've just about reached 
the point where they can be- 
gin to enjoy it. The Aga Ka- 
gans have picked this as a 
good time to move in. They’ve 
landed thirty detachments of 
‘fishermen’ — complete with 
armored trawlers mounting 40 
mm infinite repeaters — and 
another two dozen parties of 
‘homesteaders' — all male and 
toting rocket launchers.” 

“Surely there’s land enough 
on the world to afford space 
to both groups,” the Under- 
secretary said. “A spirit of 
co-operation — ” 

{{'T’HE Boyars needed some 
co-operation sixty years 
ago,” Retief said. “They tried 
to get the Aga Kagans to join 
in and help them beat back 
some of the saurian wild life 
that liked to graze on people. 
The Corps didn't like the 
idea. They wanted to see an 
undisputed anti-Concordiatist 
enclave. The Aga Kagans 
didn't want to play, either. 
But now that the world is 
tamed, they’re moving in.” 

“The exigencies of diplo- 
macy require a flexible pol- 
icy — ”

*1 want a firm assurance 
of Corps support to take back 
to Flamme,” Retief said. 
“The Boyars are a little 
naive. They don't understand 
diplomatic triple-speak. They 
just want to hold onto the 
homes they’ve made out of a 
wasteland.” 

“I'm warning you, Retief!” 
the Under-Secretary snapped, 
leaning forward, wattles quiv- 
ering. “Corps policy with re- 
gard to Flamme includes no 
inflammatory actions based 
on outmoded concepts. The 
Boyars will have to accommo- 
date themselves to the situa- 
tion !” 

“That's what I’m afraid 
of,” Retief said. “They’re not 
going to sit still and watch 
it happen. If I don’t take back 
concrete evidence of Corps 
backing, we’re going to have 
a nice hot little shooting war 
on our hands.” 

The Under-Secretary 
pushed out his lips and 
drummed his fingers on the 
desk. 

“Confounded hot-heads,” he 
muttered. “Very well, Retief. 
I’ll go along to the extent of 
a Note; but positively no 
further.” 

“A Note? I was thinking of 
something more like a squad- 
ron of Corps Peace Enforcers 
running through a few routine 
maneuvers off Flamme.” 

“Out of the question. A 
stiffly worded Protest Note is 
the best I can do. That's 
final.” 

Back in til# eorrtdoc, Mag- 

hr Keith Laeaier 



nan turned to Retief. "When; 
will you learn not to argue; 
with Under-Secretaries? One 
would think you actively dis* 
liked the idea of ever receiv- 
ing a promotion. I was aston- 
ished at the Under-Secre- 
tary’s restraint. Frankly, I 
was stunned when he actually 
agreed to a Note. I, of course, 
will have to draft it.” Mag- 
nan pulled at his lower lip 
thoughtfully. "Now, I won- 
der, should I view with deep 
concern an act of open agres- 
sion, or merely point out an 
apparent violation of techni- 
calities. .” 

"Don’t bother,” Retief said. 
"I have a draft all ready to 
go.** 

"But how—?” 

"I had a feeling I’d get pa- 
per instead of action,” Retief 
said. "I thought I’d save a 
little time all around.” 

"At times, your cynicism 
borders on impudence.” 

"At other times, it borders 
on disgust. Now, if you’ll run 
the Note through for signa- 
ture, I’ll try to catch the six 
o’clock shuttle.” 

"Leaving so soon? There’s 
an important reception to- 
night. Some of our biggest 
names will be there. An ex- 
cellent opportunity for you 
to join in the diplomatic give- 
and-take.” 

"No, thanks. I want to get 
back to Flamme and join in 
something mild, like a dino- 

saw hunt.” 

"When you get there,” said 
M^g^an* liQpe^yop’ll make 

TM&oDESEAT; AND THE STARS 


it quite clear that this matter 
is to be settled without vio- 
lence.” 

"Don*t worry. I’ll keep the 
peace, if I have to start a war 
to do it.” 

O N the broad verandah at 
Government House, Re- 
tief settled himself comfort- 
ably in a lounge chair. He ac- 
cepted a tall glass from a 
white-jacketed waiter and re- 
garded the flamboyant 
Flamme sunset, a gorgeous 
blaze of Vermillion and pur- 
ple that reflected from a still 
lake, tinged the broad lawn 
with color, silhouetted tall 
poplars among flower beds. 

"You’ve done great things 
here in sixty years, Georges,” 
said Retief. "Not that natural, 
geological processes wouldn’t 
have produced the same re- 
suits, given a couple of hun- 
dred million years.” 

"Don’t belabor the point,” 
the Boyar Chef d’Regime 
said. "Since we seem to bo 
on the verge of losing it.” 
"You’re forgetting the 
Note.” 

"A Note,” Georges said, 
waving his cigar. "What the 
purple polluted hell is a Note 
supposed to do? I’ve got Aga 
Kagan claim- jumpers camped 
in the middle of what used to 
be a fine stand of barley, 
cooking sheep’s brains over" 
dung fires not ten miles from 
Government House — and up-^ 
wind at that.* 

"Say, if that’s the same bar* 
ley you distill youfc whiskey 



from, I'd call that a first-class 
atrocity." 

“Retief, on your say-so, I’ve 
kept my boys on a short leash. 
They’ve put up with plenty. 
Last week, while you were 
away, these barbarians sailed 
that flotilla of armor-plated 
junks right through the mid- 
dle of one of our best oyster 
breeding beds. It was all I 
could do to keep a bunch of 
our men from going out in 
private helis and blasting ’em 
out of the water." 

“That wouldn’t have been 
good for the oysters, either.’’ 

“That’s what I told ’em. I 
also said you’d be back here 
in a few days with something 
from Corps HQ. When I tell 
’em all we’ve got is a piece 
of paper, that’ll be the end. 
There’s a strong vigilante or- 
ganization here that’s been 
outfitting for the last four 
weeks. If I hadn’t held them 
back with assurances that the 
CDT would step in and take 
care of this invasion, they 
would have hit them before 
now." 

tf^'T’HAT would have been 
a mistake," said Retief. 
“The Aga Kagans are tough 
customers. They’re active on 
half a dozen worlds at the mo- 
ment. They’ve been building 
up for this push for the last 
five years. A show of re- 
sistance by you Boyars with- 
out Corps backing would be 
an invitation to slaughter— 
with the excuse that you 
started it."

“So what are we going to 
do? Sit here and watch these 
goat-herders take over our 
farms and fisheries?" 

“Those goat-herders aren’t 
all they seem. They’ve got a 
first-class modern navy." 

“I’ve seen ’em. They camp 
in goat-skin tents, gallop 
around on animal-back, wear 
dresses down to their an- 
kles—* 

“The ‘goat-skin’ tents are a 
high-polymer plastic, made in 
the same factory that turns 
out those long flowing bullet- 
proof robes you mention. The 
animals are just for show. 
Back home they use helis and 
ground cars of the most mod- 
ern design." 

The Chef d’Regime chewed 
his cigar. 

“Why the masquerade?" 

“Something to do with in- 
ternal policies, I suppose." 

“So we sit tight and watch 
’em take our world away from 
us. That’s what I get for play- 
ing along with you, Retief. 
We should have clobbered 
these monkeys as soon as they 
set foot on our world." 

“Slow down, I haven’t fin- 
ished yet. There’s still the 
Note." 

“I’ve got plenty of paper 
already. Rolls and rolls of it." 

“Give diplomatic processes 
a chance," said Retief. “The 
Note hasn’t even been deliv- 
ered yet. Who knows? We 
may get surprising results." 

“If ypu expect me to sup- 
ply a runner for the purpose, 
you’re out of luck,. From what 

.fey Keith Manner 



I hear, he’s likely to come 
back with his ears stuffed in 
his hip pocket/’ 

“I’ll deliver the Note per- 
sonally/’ Retief said. “I could 
use a couple of escorts — pre- 
ferably strong-arm lads/’ 

The Chef d’Regime 
frowned, blew out a cloud of 
smoke. “I wasn’t kidding 
about these Aga Kagans,” he 
said. “I hear they have some 
nasty habits. I don’t want to 
see you operated on with the 
same knives they use to skin 
out the goats.” 

“I’d be against that myself. 
Still, the mail must go 
through.” 

“Strong-arm lads, eh? What 
have you got in mind, Re- 
tief?” 

“A little muscle in the 
background is an old diplo- 
matic custom,” Retief said. 

The Chef d’Regime stubbed 
out his cigar thoughtfully. “I 
used to be a pretty fair el- 
bow-wrestler myself,” he said. 
“Suppose I go along...?” 

“That,” said Retief, “should 
lend just the right note of 
solidarity to our little delega- 
tion.” He hitched his chair 
closer. “Now, depending on 
what we run into, here’s how 
we’ll play it...” 

II 

E IGHT miles into the roll- 
ing granite hills west of 
the capital, a black-painted of- 
ficial air-car flying the twin 
flags of Chief of State and 
Terrestrial Minister skimmed 

THE bCSERT AMD THE STARS 


along a foot above a pot-holed 
road. Slumped in the padded 
seat, the Boyar Chef d’Regime 
waved his cigar glumly at the 
surrounding hills. 

“Fifty years ago this was 
bare rock,” he said. “We’ve 
bred special strains of bac- 
teria here to break down the 
formations into soil, and we 
followed up with a program 
of broad-spectrum fertiliza- 
tion. We planned to put the 
whole area into crops by next 
year. Now it looks like the 
goats will get it.” 

. “Will that scrubland sup- 
port a crop?” Retief said, eye- 
ing the lichen-covered knolls. 

“Sure. We start with leg- 
umes and follow up with ce- 
reals. Wait until you see this 
next section. It’s an old flood 
plain, came into production 
thirty years ago. One of our 
finest—” 

The air-car topped a rise. 
The Chef dropped his cigar 
and half rose, with a hoarse 
yell. A herd of scraggly goats 
tossed their heads among a 
stand of ripe grain. The car 
pulled to a stop. Retief held 
the Boyar’s arm. 

“Keep calm, Georges,” he 
said. “Remember, we’re on a 
diplomatic mission. It 
wouldn’t do to come to the 
conference table smelling of 
goats.” 

“Let me at ’em!” Georges 
roared. “I’ll throttle ’em with 
my bare hands!” • 

A bearded goat eyed the 
Boyar Chef sardonically, jaw 
working. “Look at that long- 

75 



nosed son!” The goat gave a 
derisive bleat and took anoth- 
er mouthful of ripe grain. 

"Did you see that?” Georges 
yelled. "They’ve trained the 
son of a — ” 

"Chin up, Georges,” Retief 
said. "We’ll take up the goat 
problem along wit!: the rest.” 

"I’ll murder ’em!” 

"Hold it, Georges. Look 
over there.” 

A hundred yards away, a 
trio of brown-cloaked horse- 
men topped a rise, paused 
dramatically against the 
cloudless pale sky, then gal- 
loped down the slope toward 
the car, rifles bobbing at their 
backs, cloaks billowing out 
behind. Side by side they 
rode, through the brown- 
golden grain, cutting three 
narrow swaths that ran in a 
straight sweep from the ridge 
to the air-car where Retief 
and the Chef d’Regime hov- 
ered, waiting. 

Georges scrambled for the 
side of the car. "Just wait ’til 
I get my hands on him!” 

Retief pulled him back. 
"Sit tight and look pleased, 
Georges. Never give the op- 
position a hint of your true 
feelings. Pretend you’re a 
goat lover — and hand me one 
of your cigars.” 

The three horsemen pulled 
up in a churn of chaff and a 
clatter of pebbles. Georges 
coughed, batting a hand at 
the settling dust. Retief 
peeled the cigar unhurriedly, 
sniffed at it and thumbed it 
alight, He drew ^t it, puffed 

76 . 


out a cloud of smoke and 
glanced casually at the trio 
of Aga Kagan cavaliers. 

"Peace be with you,” he in- 
toned in accent-free Kagan. 
"May your shadows never 
grow less.” 


T HE leader of the three, a 
hawk-faced man with a 
heavy beard, unlimbered his 
rifle. He fingered it, frown- 
ing ferociously. 

"Have no fear,” Retief said, 
smiling graciously. "He who 
comes as a guest enjoys per- 
fect safety.” 

A smooth-faced member of 
the threesome barked an oath 
and leveled his rifle at Re- 
tief. 

"Youth is the steed of 
folly,” Retief said. "Take 
care that the beardless one 
does not disgrace his house.” 
The leader whirled on the 
youth and snarled an order. 
He lowered the rifle, mutter- 
ing. Blackbeard turned back 
to Retief. 

"Begone, interlopers,” he 
said. "You disturb the goats.” 

"Provision is not taken to 
the houses of the generous,” 
Retief said. "May the crea- 
tures dine well ere they move 


"Hah! The goats of the Aga 
Kaga graze on the lands of 
the Aga Kaga.” The leader 
edged his horse close, eyed 
Retief fiercely. "We welcome 
no intruders on our lands /' 1 

"To praise a man for what' 
he does not possess is t<? make 
him appear foolish,” ftetief

said. “These are the lands of 
the Boyars. But enough of 
these pleasantries. We seek 
audience with your ruler.” 

“You may address me as 
‘Exalted One’,” the leader 
said. “Now dismount from 
that steed of Shaitan.” 

“It is written, if you need 
anything from a dog, call him 
‘sir’,” Retief said. “I must de- 
cline to impute canine ances- 
try to a guest. Now you may 
conduct us to your headquar- 
ters.” 

“Enough of your inso- 
lence !” The bearded man 
cocked his rifle. “I could 
blow your heads off !” 

“The hen has feathers, but 
it does not fly,” Retief said. 
“We have asked for escort. A 
slave must be beaten with a 
stick; for a free man, a hint 
is enough.” 

“You mock me, pale one. I 
warn you — ” 

“Only love makes me weep,” 
Retief said. “I laugh at 
hatred.” 

“Get out of the car!” 

Retief puffed at his cigar, 
eyeing the Aga Kagan cheer- 
fully. The youth in the rear 
moved forward, teeth bared. 

“Never give in to the fool, 
lest he say, ‘He fears me/ ” 
Retief said. 

“I cannot restrain my men 
in the face of your insults,” 
the bearded Aga Kagan 
roared. “These hens of mine 
have feathers — and talons as 
well !” 

“When God would destroy 
an ant, he gives him wings,” 

THE DESERT AND THE STARS 


Retief said. “Distress in mis- 
fortune is another misfor- 
tune.” 

The bearded man’s face 
grew purple. 

„ Retief dribbled the ash 
from his cigar over the side 
of the car, 

“Now I think we’d better 
be getting on,” he said brisk- 
ly. “I've enjoyed our chat, but 
we do have business to attend 
to.” 

The bearded leader laughed 
shortly. “Does the condemned 
man beg for the axe?” he en- 
quired rhetorically. “Y o u 
shall visit the Aga Kaga, then. 
Move on! And make no at- 
tempt to escape, else my gun 
will speak you a brief fare- 
well.” 

The horsemen glowered, 
then, at a word from the lead- 
er, took positions around the 
car. Georges started the ve- 
hicle forward, following the 
leading rider. Retief leaned 
back and let out a long sigh. 

“That was close,” he said. 
“I was about out of proverbs.” 

“You sound as though you’d 
brought off a coup,” Georges 
said. “From the expression on 
the whiskery one’s face, we’re 
in for trouble. What was he 
saying?” 

“Just a routine exchange of 
bluffs,” Retief said. “Now 
when we get there, remember 
to make your flattery sound 
like insults and your insults 
sound like flattery, and you’ll 
be all right.” 

“These birds are armed. 
And they don’t like stran- 

77 



gers,” Georges said. “ Maybe 
I should have boned up on 
their habits before I joined 
this expedition.” 

“Just stick to the plan,” Re- 
tief said. “And remember: a 
handful of luck is better than 
a camel-load of learning.” 

T HE air car followed the es- 
cort down a long slope to 
a dry river bed and across it, 
through a barren stretch of 
shifting sand to a green oasis 
set with canopies. 

The armed escort motioned 
the car to a halt before an 
immense tent of glistening 
black. Before the tent armed 
men lounged under a pennant 
bearing a lion couchant in 
crimson on a field verte. 

“Get out,” Blackbeard or- 
dered. The guards eyed the 
visitors, their drawn sabers 
catching sunlight. Retief and 
Georges stepped from the car 
onto rich rugs spread on the 
grass. They followed the fero- 
cious gesture of the bearded 
man through the opening into 
a perfumed interior of lu- 
minous shadows. A heavy 
odor of incense hung in the 
air, and the strumming of 
stringed instruments laid a 
muted pattern of sound be- 
hind the decorations of gold 
and blue, silver and green. At 
the far end of the room, 
among a bevy of female 
slaves, a large and resplen- 
dently clad man with blue- 
black hair and a clean-shaven 
chin popped a grape into his 
mouth. He wiped his fingers 

78 


negligently on a wisp of silk 
offered » by a handmaiden, 
belched loudly and looked the 

callers over. 

■» 

Blackbeard cleared his 
throat. “Down on your faces 
in the presence of the Exalt- 
ed One, the Aga Kaga, ruler 
of East and West.” 

“Sorry,” Retief said firmly. 
“My hay-fever, you know.” 

The reclining giant waved 
a hand languidly. 

“Never mind the formali- 
ties,” he said. “Approach.” 

Retief and Georges crossed 
the thick rugs. A cold draft 
blew toward them. The reclin- 
ing man sneezed violently, 
wiped his nose on another 
silken scarf and held up a 
hand. 

“Night and the horses and 
the desert know me,” he said 
in resonant tones. “Also the 
sword and the guest and pa- 
per and pen — ” He paused, 
wrinkled his nose and sneezed 
again. “Turn off that damned 
air-conditioner,” he snapped. 

He settled himself and mo- 
tioned the bearded man to 
him. The two exchanged 
muted remarks. Then the 
bearded man stepped back, 
ducked his head and withdrew 
to the rear. 

“Excellency,” Retief said, 
“I have the honor to present 
M. Georges Duror, Chef 
d’Regime of the Planetary 
government.” 

“Planetary government?” 
The Aga Kaga spat grape 
seeds on the rug. “My men 
have observed a few squatters 

by Keith Laumer 



along the shore. If they’re in 
distress, I'll see about a dis- 
tribution of goat-meat.” 

“It is the punishment of the 
envious to grieve at anothers’ 
plenty,” Retief said “No goat- 
meat will be required.” 
“Ralph told me you talk 
like a page out of Mustapha 
ben Abdallah Katib Jelebi,” 
the Aga Kaga said. “I know 
a few old sayings myself. For 
example, ‘A Bedouin is only 
cheated once.’ ” 

“We have no such inten- 
tions, Excellency,” Retief 
said. “Is it not written, ‘Have 
no faith in the Prince whose 
minister cheats you’?” 

“I’ve had some unhappy ex- 
periences with strangers,” the 
Aga Kaga said. “It is written 
in the sands that all strangers 
are kin. Still, he who visits 
rarely is a welcome guest. Be 
seated.” 

Ill 

H andmaidens brought 

cushions, giggled and 
fled. Retief and Georges set- 
tled themselves comfortably. 
The Aga Kaga eyed them in 
silence. 

“We have come to bear tid- 
ings from the Corps Diploma- 
tique Terrestrienne,” Retief 
said solemnly. A perfumed 
slave girl offered grapes. 

“Modest ignorance is better 
than boastful knowledge,” the 
Aga Kaga said. “What brings 
the CDT into the picture?” 
“The essay of the drunkard 
will be read in the tavern,” 


Retief said. “Whereas the 
words of kings...” 

“Very well, I concede the 
point.” The Aga Kaga waved 
a hand at the serving maids. 
“Depart, my dears. Attend me 
later. You too, Ralph. These 
are mere diplomats. They are 
men of words, not deeds.” 

The bearded man glared and 
departed. The girls hurried 
after him. 

“Now,” the Aga Kaga said. 
“Let’s drop the wisdom of the 
ages and get down to the is- 
sues. Not that I don’t admire 
your repertoire of platitudes. 
How do you remember them 
all?” 

“Diplomats and other liars 
require good memories,” said 
Retief. “But as you point out, 
small wisdom to small minds. 
I’m here to effect a settle- 
ment of certain differences 
between yourself and the 
planetary authorities. I have 
here a Note, which I’m con- 
veying on behalf of the Sec- 
tor Under-Secretary. With 
your permission. I’ll read it.” 

“Go ahead.” The Aga Kaga 
kicked a couple of cushions 
onto the floor, eased a bottle 
from under the couch and 
reached for glasses. 

“The Under-Secretary for 
Sector Affairs presents his 
compliments to his Excel- 
lency, the Aga Kaga of the 
Aga Kaga, Primary Poten- 
tate, Hereditary Sheik, Emir 
of the — ” 

“Yes, yes. Skip the titles.” 

Retief flipped over two 
pages*

“...and with reference to 
the recent relocation of per- 
sons under the jurisdiction of 
his Excellency, has the honor 
to point out that the terri- 
tories now under settlement 
comprise a portion of that 
area, hereinafter designated 
as Sub-sector Alpha, which, 
under terms of the Agree- 
ment entered into by his 
Excellency’s predecessor, and 
as referenced in Sector 
Ministry’s Notes numbers 
G-175846573957-b and X-7584- 
736 c-1, with particular perti- 
nence to that body designated 
in the Revised Galactic Cata- 
logue, Tenth Edition, as 
amended, Volume Nine, reel 
43, as 54 Cygni Alpha, other- 
wise referred to hereinafter 
as Flamme — ” 

“Come to the point,” the 
Aga Kaga cut in. “You’re here 
to lodge a complaint that I’m 
invading territories to which 
someone else lays claim, is 
that it?” He smiled broadly, 
offered dope-sticks and lit 
one. “Well, I’ve been expect- 
ing a call. After all, it’s what 
you gentlemen are paid for. 
Cheers.” 

“Your Excellency has a 
lucid way of putting things,” 
Retief said. 

“Call me Stanley,” the Aga 
Kaga said. “The other rou- 
tine is just to please some of 
the old fools — I mean the 
more conservative members of 
my government. They’re still 
gnawing their beards and 
kicking themselves because 
their ancestors dropped sci- 

60 


ence in favor of alchemy and 
got themselves stranded in a 
cultural dead end. This 
charade is supposed to prove 
they were right all along. 
However, I’ve no time to 
waste in neurotic compensa- 
tions. I have places to go and 
deeds to accomplish.” 

“At first glance,” Retief 
said, “it looks as though the 
places are already occupied, 
and the deeds are illegal.” 

T HE Aga Kaga guffawed. 

“For a diplomat, you 
speak plainly, Retief. Have 
another drink.” He poured, 
eyeing Georges. “What of M. 
Duror? How does he feel 
about it?” 

Georges took a thoughtful 
swallow of whiskey. “Not 
bad,” he said. “But not quite 
good enough to cover the odor 
of goats.” 

The Aga Kaga snorted. “I 
thought the goats were over- 
doing it a bit myself,” he said. 
“Still, the graybeards insist- 
ed. And I need their sup- 
port.” 

“Also,” Georges said dis- 
tinctly, “I think you’re soft. 
You lie around letting wom- 
en wait on you, while your 
betters are out doing an hon- 
est day’s work.” 

The Aga Kaga looked star- 
tled. “Soft? I can tie a knot 
in an iron bar as big as your 
thumb.” He popped a grape 
into his mouth. “As for the 
rest, your pious views about 
the virtues of hard labor are 
as childish as my advisors’ 
faith in the advantages of 

by Ksith Laamsr 



primitive plumbing. As for 
myself, I am a realist. If two 
monkeys want the same ba- 
nana, in the end one will have 
it, and the other will cry 
morality. The days of my 
years are numbered, praise be 
to God. While they last, I 
hope to eat well, hunt well, 
fight well and take my share 
of pleasure. I leave to others 
the arid satisfactions of .self- 
denial and other perversions.” 

“You admit you’re here to 
grab our land, then,” Georges 
said. ‘‘That’s the damnedest 
piece of bare-faced aggres- 
sion — ” 

“Ah, ah!” The Aga Kaga 
held up a hand. “Watch your 
vocabulary, my dear sir. I’m 
sure that ‘justifiable yearn- 
ings for territorial self-reali- 
zation’ would be more appro- 
priate to the situation. Or 
possibly ‘legitimate aspira- 
tions. for self-determination 
of formerly exploited peoples’ 
might , fit the .case. Aggression 
is, by definition, an activity 
carried on only by those who 
have inherited the mantle of 
Colonial Imperialism.” 

“Imperialism ! ,Why, you 
Aga v Kagans have been the 
most notorious planet-grab- 
bers in Sector history, you— 
you—” 

“Call me Stanley.” The Aga 
Kaga munched a g rape. “I 
merely face the realities of 
popular ^olk-Iore. .- Let’s be 
pragitotic; it's* a* matter of 
historical > associatiom * - Some 
peopoiercan^grab land and pass 
it off lightly as a moral duty: 

THE DESERT AND THE STARS 


others are dubbed imperialist 
merely for holding onto their 
own. Unfair, you say. But 
that’s life, my friends. And I 
shall continue to take every 
advantage of it.” 

“We’ll fight you!” Georges 
bellowed. He took another 
gulp of whiskey and slammed 
the glass down. “You won’t 
take this world without a 
struggle !” 

“Another?” the Aga Kaga 
said, offering the bottle. 
Georges glowered as his glass 
was filled., The Aga Kaga 
held the glass up to the light. 

“Excellent color, don’t you 
agree?” He turned his eyes 
on Georges. 

“It’s pointless to resist,” he 
said. “We have you outgunned 
and outmanned. Your small 
nation has no chance against 
us. But we’re prepared to be 
generous. You may continue 
, to occupy, such areas as we 
do not immediately reguire 
until suck time as. yop’rOigible 
to make other arrangements.” 

“And by the time we’ve got 
a crop growing , out of what 
was bare rock, you’ll be ready 
to move in,” the Boyar Chef 
d’Regime snapped. “But you’ll 
find k that we aren’t alone !” 

{{^VUITE alone,” the Aga 

V** said. He nodded saeely. 
“Yes, one need but read the 
lesson of history. The Corps 
Diplomatique will make ex- 
postulatory noises, but it will 
a accept the fait accompli. You, 
*dear - sir, are but a very 
small nibble. We won’t make 
the mistake of excessive 

81 



greed. We shall inch our way 
to empire — and those who 
stand in our way shall be 
dubbed warmongers.” 

“I see you’re quite a stu- 
dent of history, Stanley,” Re- 
tief said. “I wonder if you 
recall the eventual fate of 
most of the would-be empire 
nibblers of the past?” 

“Ah, but they grew incau- 
tious. They went too far, too 
fast.” 

“The confounded impu- 
dence,” Georges rasped. 
“Tells us to our face what he 
has in mind !” 

“An ancient and honorable 
custom, from the time of 
Mein Kampf and the Commu- 
nist Manifesto through the 
Porcelain Wall of Leung. 
Such declarations have a leg- 
endary quality. It’s, tradition- 
al that they’re never taken at 
face value.” 

“But always,” Retief said, 
“there was a critical point at 
which vthe man on horseback 
could have been pulled from 
the saddle.” 

“ Could have been,” the Aga 
Kaga chuckled. He finished 
the grapes and began peeling 
an orange. “But they never 
were. Hitler could have been 
stopped by the Czech Air 
Force in 1938; Stalin was at 
the mercy of the primitive 
atomics of the west in 1946 ; 
Leung was grossly over-ex- 
tended at Rangoon. But the 
onus of that historic role 
could not be overcome. It has 
been the fate of your spiritu- 
al forebears to carve civiliza- 


tion from the wilderness and 
then, amid tearing of gar- 
ments and the heaping of 
ashes of self-accusation on 
your own confused heads, to 
withdraw, leaving the spoils 
for local political opportu- 
nists and mob leaders, clothed 
in the mystical virtue of na- 
tive birth. Have a banana.” 

“You’re stretching your 
analogy a little too far,” Re- 
tief said. “You’re banking on 
the inaction of the Corps. You 
could be wrong.” 

“I shall know when to 
stop,” the Aga Kaga said. 

“Tell me, Stanley,” Retief 
said, rising. “Are we quite 
private here?” 

“Yes, perfectly so,” the Aga 
Kaga said. “None would dare 
to intrude in my council.” He 
cocked an eyebrow at Retief. 
“You have a proposal to make 
in confidence? But what of 
our dear friend Georges? One 
would not like to see him dis- 
illusioned.” 

“Don’t worry about 
Georges. He’s a realist, like 
you. He’s prepared to deal in 
facts. Hard facts, in this 
case.” 

The Aga Kaga nodded 
thoughtfully. “What are you 
getting at?” 

“You’re basing your plan of 
action -on the certainty that 
the Corps will sit by, wring- 
ing its hands, while you em- 
bark on a career of planetary 
piracy.” 

“Isn’t it the custom?” the 
Aga Kaga smiled complacent- 
ly.

“I have news for you, Stan- 
ley. t . In this instance, neck- 
wringing seems more; in order 
than hand-wringing.” 

The Aga Kaga frowned. 
“Your manner — ” 

“Never mind our manners!” 
Georges blurted, standing. 
“We don’t need any lessons 
from goat-herding land- 
thieves!” 

The Aga Kaga’s face dark- 
ened. “You dare to speak thus 
to me, pig of a muck-grub- 
ber!” 

W ITH a muffled curse 
Georges launched himself 
at the potentate. The giant 
rolled aside. He grunted as 
the Boyar’s fist thumped in 
his short ribs; then he 
chopped down on Georges’ 
neck. The Chef d’Regime slid 
off onto the floor a? the Aga 
Kaga bounded to his feet, 
sending fruit and silken cush- 
ions flying. , . ; 

“I see it now!*’ he hissed. 
“An assassination attempt !” 
He stretched his arms, thick 
as tree-roots — a grizzly in 
satin robes. “Your heads will 
ring together like gongs be- 
fore I have done with you !” 
He lunged for Retief. Retief 
came to his feet, feinted with 
his left and planted a short 
right against the Aga Kaga’s 
jaw with a solid smack. The 
potentate stumbled, grabbed; 
Retief slipped aside. The Aga 
Kaga whirled to face Retief. 

: “A slippery diplomat, by 
all the houris in Paradise!” 
he grated, breathing hard. 
“But a fool. True to your 

84 


medieval code of chivalry, you 
attacked singly, a blunder I 
would never have made* And 
you shall die for your idio- 
cy !” He opened his mouth to 
bellow — 

“You sure look foolish, 
with your fancy hair-do down 
in your eyes,” Retief said. 
“The servants will get a big 
laugh out of it.” 

With a choked yell, the 
Aga Kaga dived for Retief, 
missed as he leaped aside. 
The two went to the mat to- 
gether and rolled, sending a 
stool skittering. Grunts and 
curses echoed as the two big 
men strained, muscles pop- 
ping. Retief groped for a 
scissors hold ; the Aga Kaga 
seized his foot, bit hard. Re- 
tief bent nearly double, braced 
himself and slammed the po- 
tentate against the rug. Dust 
flew. Then the two were on 
their feet, circling. 

“Many times Havt I longed 
t?9 btoil a 1 ''diplohruft' civet ‘ a 
slow fire-” the Aga 'Kaga 
j snatled. “Tonight will see it 
come to pass V* 1 * ’ y > 1 : • 
“I’ve seen it done often" at 
staff meetings,” said Retief. 
“It seems to* have no perma- 
nent effect.” , 

The Aga* Kaga reached for 
Retief, who feinted left', ham- 
mered ^a right to the thin. 
The Aga Kaga tottered. Re- 
tief measured him, brought 
up a haymaker. The potentate 
slammed to the rug — out cold.

“Take over, Georges/’ Re- 
tief said, panting. “Since he's 
in a mood to negotiate now, 
we may as well get something 
accomplished.” 

Georges eyed the fallen 
ruler, who stirred, groaned 
lugubriously. “I hope you 
know what you’re doing,” 
Georges said. “But I’m with 
you in any case.” He strad- 
dled the prone body, plucked 
a curved knife from the low 
table and prodded the Aga 
Kaga’s Adam’s apple. The 
monarch opened his eyes. 

“Make one little peep and 
your windbag will spring a 
leak,” Georges said. “Very 
few historical figures have 
accomplished anything impor- 
tant after their throats were 
cut.” 

“Stanley won’t yell,” Retief 
said. “We’re not the only ones 
who’re guilty of cultural 
idiocy. He’d lose face some- 
thing awful if he let his fol- 
lowers see him like this.” Re- 
tief settled himself on a 
tufted ottoman. “Right, Stan- 
ley?” 

The Aga Kaga snarled. 

Retief selected a grape and 
ate it thoughtfully. “These 
aren’t bad, Georges. You 
might consider taking on a 
few Aga Kagan vine-growers 
— purely on a yearly contract 
basis, of course.” 

The Aga Kaga groaned, 
rolling his eyes. 

“Well, I believe we’re ready 
to get down to diplomatic 

THE DESERT AND THE STARS 


proceedings n o w,” Retief 
said. “Nothing like dealing in 
an atmosphere of realistic 
good fellowship. First, of 
course, there’s the matter of 
the presence of aliens lacking 
visas.” He opened his brief- 
case, withdrew a heavy sheet 
of parchment. “I have the 
document here, drawn up and 
ready for signature. It pro- 
vides for the prompt deporta- 
tion of such persons, by 
Corps Transport, all expenses 
to be borne by the Aga Kagan 
government. That’s agreeable, 
I assume?” Retief looked ex- 
pectantly at the purple face 
of the prone potentate. The 
Aga Kaga grunted a strangled 
grunt. 

“Speak up, Stanley,” Retief 
said. “Give him plenty of air, 
Georges.” 

“Shall I let some in through 
the side?” 

“Not yet. I’m sure Stanley 
wants to be agreeable.” 

The Aga Kaga snarled. 

“Maybe just a little then, 
Georges,” Retief said judi- 
ciously. Georges jabbed the 
knife in far enough to draw 
a bead of blood. The Aga 
Kaga grunted. 

“Agreed!” he snorted. “By 
the beard of the prophet, 
when I get my hands on 

you ...” 

“Second item : certain 

fields, fishing grounds, et 
cetera, have suffered damage 
due to the presence of the 
aforementioned illegal immi- 


85 



grants. Full compensation 
will be made by the Aga Ka- 
gan government. Agreed?” 

T HE Aga Kaga drew a 
breath, tensed himself ; 
Georges jabbed with the knife 
point. His prisoner relaxed 
with a groan. “Agreed!” he 
grated. “A vile tactic! You 
enter my tent under the guise 
of guests, protected by dip- 
lomatic immunity — ” 

“I had the impression we 
were herded in here at sword 
point,” said Retief. “Shall we 
go on? Now there’s the little 
matter of restitution for vio- 
lation of sovereignty, repara- 
tions for mental anguish, 
payment for damaged fences, 
roads, drainage canals, com- 
munications, et cetera, et 
cetera. Shall I read them 
all?” 

“Wait until the news of this 
outrage is spread abroad !” 
“They'd never believe it,” 
Retief said. “History would 
prove it impossible. And on 
mature consideration, I’m 
sure you won’t want it noised 
about that you entertained 
visiting dignitaries flat on 
your back.” 

“What about the pollution 
of the atmosphere by goats?” 
Georges put in. “And don’t 
overlook the muddying of 
streams, the destruction of 
timber for camp fires and — ” 

“I’ve covered all that sort 
of thing under a miscellane- 
ous heading,” Retief said. 
“We can fill it in at leisure 
when //e get back.” 

“Bandits!” the Aga Kaga 

86 


hissed. “Thieves! Dogs of un- 
reliable imperialists!” 

“It is disillusioning, I 
know,” Retief said. “Still, of 
such little surprises is history 
made. Sign here.” He held the 
parchment out and offered a 
pen. “A nice clear signature, 
please. We wouldn’t want any 
quibbling about the legality 
of the treaty, after conducting 
the negotiation with such 
scrupulous regard for the 
niceties.” 

“Niceties! Never in history 
has such an abomination been 
perpetrated !” 

“Oh, treaties are always 
worked out this way, when it 
comes right down to it. We’ve 
just accelerated the process a 
little. Now, if you’ll just sign 
like a good fellow, we’ll be 
on our way. Georges will have 
his work cut out for him, 
planning how to use all this 
reparations money.” 

The Aga Kaga gnashed his 
teeth; Georges prodded. The 
Aga Kaga seized the pen and 
scrawled his name. Retief 
signed with a flourish. He 
tucked the treaty away in his 
briefcase, took out another. 

“This is just a safe-conduct, 
to get us out of the door and 
into the car,” he said. “Prob- 
ably unnecessary, but it won’t 
hurt to have it, in case you 
figure out some way to avoid 
your obligations as a host.” 

The Aga Kaga signed the 
document after another prod 
from Georges. 

“One more paper, and I’ll 
be into the jugular,” he said. 

by Keith Laumer 



44\V7E’RE all through 
now,” said Retief. 
“Stanley, we’re going to have 
to run now. I’m going to strap 
up your hands and feet a 
trifle ; it shouldn’t take you 
more than ten minutes or so 
to get loose, stick a band- 
aid on your neck and — ” 

“My men will cut you down 
for the rascals you are !’’ 

“By that time, we’ll be over 
the hill,” Retief continued. 
“At full throttle^ we’ll be at 
Government House in an 
hour, and of course I won’t 
waste any time transmitting 
the treaty to Sector HQ. And 
the same concern for face that 
keeps you from yelling for 
help will insure that the de- 
tails of the negotiation re- 
main our secret.” 

“Treaty! That scrap of pa- 
per!” 

“I confess the Corps is a 
little sluggish about taking 
action at times,” Retief said, 
whipping a turn of silken cord 
around the Aga Kaga’s ankles. 
“But once it’s got signatures 
on a legal treaty, it’s extreme- 
ly stubborn about all parties 
adhering to the letter. It can’t 
afford to be otherwise, as I’m 
sure you’ll understand.” He 
cinched up the cord, went to 
work on the hands. The Aga 
Kaga glared at him balefully. 

“To the Pit with the Corps! 
The ferocity of my re- 
venge—” 

“Don’t talk nonsense, Stan- 
ley. There are several squad- 
rons of Peace Enforcers cruis- 
ing in the Sector just now. 

THE DESERT AND THE STARS 


I’m sure you’re not ready to 
make any historical errors by 
taking them on.” Retief fin- 
ished and stood. 

“Georges, just stuff a scarf 
in Stanley’s mouth. I think 
he’d prefer to work quietly 
until he recovers his dignity.” 
Retief buckled his briefcase, 
selected a large grape and 
looked down at the Aga Kaga. 

“Actually, you’ll be glad 
you saw things our way, Stan- 
ley,” he said. “You’ll get all 
the credit for the generous 
settlement. Of course, it will 
be a striking precedent for 
any other negotiations that 
may become necessary if you 
get grabby on other worlds in 
this region. And if your ad- 
visors want to know why the 
sudden change of heart, just 
tell them you’ve decided to 
start from scratch on an un- 
occupied world. Mention the 
virtues of thrift and hard 
work. I’m confident you can 
find plenty of historical ex- 
amples to support you.” 

“Thanks for the drink,” 
said Georges. “Drop in on me 
at Government House some 
time and we’ll crack another 
bottle.” 

“And don’t feel bad about 
your project’s going awry,” 
Retief said. “In the words of 
the prophet, ’Stolen goods are 
never sold at a loss.’ ” 

ii A remarkable about-face, 

** Retief,” Magnan said. 
“Let this be a lesson to you. 
A stern Note of Protest can 
work wonders.” 

87 



“A lot depends on the 
method of delivery/' Retief 
said. 

“Nonsense. I knew all along 
the Aga Kagans were a rea- 
sonable and peace-loving peo- 
ple. One of the advantages of 
senior rank, of course, is the 
opportunity to see the big 
picture. Why, I was saying 
only this morning — ” 

The desk screen broke into 
life. The mottled jowls of 
Under-Secretary Sternwheeler 
appeared. 

“Magnan! I’ve just learned 
of the Flamme affair. Who’s 
responsible?” 

“Why, ah. I suppose that 
I might be said — ” 

“This is your work, is it?” 

“Well... Mr. Retief did 
play the role of messenger.” 

“Don’t pass the buck, Mag- 
nan!” the Under-Secretary 
barked. “What the devil went 
on out there?” 

“Just a routine Protest 
Note. Everything is quite in 
order.” 

“Bah! Your over-zealous- 
ness has cost me dear. I was 
feeding Flamme to the Aga 
Kagans to consolidate our po- 
sition of moral superiority for 
use as a lever in a number of 
important negotiations. Now 
they've backed out ! Aga Kaga 
emerges from the affair 
wreathed in virtue. You've 
destroyed a very pretty 
finesse in power politics, Mr. 
Magnan! A year’s work down 
the drain!” 

“But I thought — ” 

“I doubt that, Mr. Magnan, 

M 


I doubt that very much!” The 
Under-Secretary rang off. 

“This is a fine turn of 
events,” Magnan groaned. 
“Retief, you know very well 
Protest Notes are merely in- 
tended for the historical rec- 
ord ! No one ever takes them 
seriously.” 

“You and the Aga Kaga 
ought to get together,” said 
Retief. “He’s a great one for 
citing historical parallels. 
He’s not a bad fellow, as a 
matter of fact. I have an in- 
vitation from him to visit 
Kaga and go mud-pig hunting. 
He was so impressed by 
Corps methods that he wants 
to be sure we’re on his side 
next time. Why don’t you 
come along?” 

“Hmmm. Perhaps I should 
cultivate him. A few high- 
level contacts never do any 
harm. On the other hand, I 
understand he lives in a very 
loose way, feasting and mer- 
rymaking. Frivolous in the 
extreme. No wife, you under- 
stand, but hordes of lightly 
clad women about. And in 
that connection, the Aga Ka- 
gans have some very curious 
notions as to what constitutes 
proper hospitality to a guest.” 

Retief rose, pulled on the 
powder blue cloak and black 
velvet gauntlets of a Career 
Minister. 

“Don’t let it worry you,” 
he said. “You’ll have a great 
time. And as the Aga Kaga 
would say, ‘Ugliness is the 
best safeguard of virginity.’ ”

JP # Short Story 


THE MAN 
WHO FLEW 


BY CHARLES D. CUNNINGHAM, JR. 


The Man Who Flew could 
not exist — but he had 
committed a foul crime! 


C LOUDS hung low over the 
city, gray and dismal. The 
shining metal thruway partial- 
ly reflected their somber 
visage. A few vehicles scur- 
ried nervously through the 
city. 

Keller turned away from 
the window dismally. His con- 
science was bothering him, 
and it affected his every 
movement. Looking over his 
humbly furnished office, he 
entertained the thought, not 
for the first time, that he 


89 



should change jobs if he want- 
ed to eat* 

A buzz sounded — the inter- 
com system. That would be 
Sally, his secretary. It was a 
mystery what she would want. 
Usually she never bothered 
him except in case of an emer- 
gency, and the last client Kel- 
ler had had dropped his case 
three months ago. 

Apparently it was another 
customer, unlikely as it 
seemed. Keller heard voices 
outside, Sally’s irritated and 
protesting, and a nervous 
baritone. Abruptly the door 
opened, disclosing a rugged, 
bushy-haired C-3 (average in- 
telligence and advanced ex- 
tra-sensory perception, but 
unexercised), who was in a 
bad state of nerves. 

He seemed to have forced 
his way past Sally into the in- 
ner office. 

Keller flashed a thought at 
Sally: **How does he look?** 

**Not so hot,** she an- 
swered. **I didn’t bother to 
scan much — don’t want to 
lower myself to that depth — 
but he seems to be a big paver. 
He’s impatient, though. And 
he wants everything run his 
wav.** 

Oh, fine, thought Keller. 
My first victim in three 
months, and it has to be the 
Big Shot type. 

He made the usual Q-R 
opening; curtly and efficient- 
ly: 

“Your name?" 

90 


“Uh — Harold Radcliffe 
“Why the hesitation?” But 
Keller had scanned it already. 
The man was simply cautious. 
He continued without letting 
Radcliffe answer: 

“Age?” 33. “Occupation?” 
Hesitation : Salesman. “Resi- 
dence?” After writing this 
and Radcliffe’s telephone 
number down, he closed his 
‘grimy black notebook and sat 
back. 

“And how, Mr. Radcliffe, 
why exactly did you come 
here?” 

Radcliffe, unsure of him- 
self at first, gathered confi- 
dence as he noticed Keller’s 
interest growing. He began: 
“Well sir, for this job I 
need one of the best detec- 
tives — ” he paused at Keller’s 
grimace — “and since you’re 
one of the few detectives in 
the city who can read minds, 
and the only A-2 ’tec in the 
state — ” He shrugged, and 
finished, “I figured you’d be 
the man for me.” 

Keller saw that he was tell- 
ing the truth, after a quick 
check into the man’s mind. 
“All right, Mr. Radcliffe. 
What’s your problem?” 

R adcliffe seemed to not 
be able to focus his 
thoughts. His mind, Keller 
saw, was a loose stream of un- 
connected thoughts, trying to 
merge into a whple. Keller 
could read no message out of 
them. He suspected a block — 

by Charles D. Cunningham, Jr; 



an unusual thing for a C-3, 
but not impossible* 

He gave up, sat back and 
awaited the other's response. 
Finally it came, jerking Kel- 
ler out of his chair. 

"It’s murder, Mr. Keller. 
The murder of my wife.’' 

Murder! 

It was the first suspected 
murder in thirteen years. 
Ever since the Ricjards case 
in '04, peace and tranquility 
reigned in a calm and placid 
nation. For thirteen peaceful 
years there had been no hint 
of manslaughter other than 
accidental. It had been condi- 
tioned out of humans at the 
prenatal stage, and unless 
there was a violent, all-en- 
compassing urge to kill, mur- 
der was completely out of the 
question. 

It was hard to believe. But 
it was not a lie; no non-tele 
could block a lie, and Keller 
scanned the truth in Rad- 
cliffe’s brain. 

"Wait a minute, Radcliffe. 
Are you sure it's not mur- 
der by accident — unintention- 
al manslaughter, as the police 
term it? Or it could be sui- 
cide. Had you thought of 
that?” 

Radcliffe shook his head 
impatiently. He rose out of 
his chair, pacing the floor 
nervously. "It could not pos- 
sibly be accident. You’ll see 
that when you investigate the 
case. Suicide? It’s possible. 
Anything is possible, I sup- 
pose, but I would lay any kind 

THE MAN WHO FLEW 


of odds against it. We had 
just been to the theater. We 
returned to our apartment at 
about five minutes to eleven. 

"After undressing and 
showering, I started to turn 
in. I noticed a light on in her 
room— we sleep in separate 
rooms — and called to her, to 
see if anything was wrong. 
There was no answer. 

"I figured that she had 
gone to sleep with the light 
on, and went into the room to 
turn it off. That was when I 
saw her on the floor.” He 
stopped. Keller read grief, 
fear and love in his memory. 

"How had she been killed?” 

"It was a handgun, Mr. 
Keller. Her face was all 
blackened and charred. Bare- 
ly recognizable. But I knew it 
must be her. Our rooms con- 
nect, you see. There are two 
other doors to each room; one 
to the outside hall, and one to 
each bathroom. 

"When she was shot, my 
door was locked on the inside 
— triple-locked, I remember, 
because I felt like being left 
alone that night. It was locked 
by chain, bar and bolt. It’s a 
fairly ancient apartment 
house. We like it that way. 
Her bathroom door was open 
and there was no one hiding 
inside. The same went for my 
bathroom. And both hall doors 
were locked and bolted. 

"The windows were locked 
on the inside, and there is no 
opening to shoot through that 
would not leave traces. I 
checked. 


91 



“Even if the killer had got- 
ten in some way or other, 
there was no way he could get 
out and still leave the doors 
and windows locked up tight.” 
Keller thought, there is one 
way, Mr. Radcliffe. But he 
kept it to himself for the mo- 
ment. 

H E looked up and smiled 
as confidently as he 
could. “I’ll be glad to take 
your case, Mr. Radcliffe. Of 
course you want me to spare 
no expenses,” he added hope- 
fully. At Radcliffe’s harassed 
nod, he relaxed. 

Next came the most danger- 
ous part of the job. It was a 
part which had eliminated 
several competent detectives 
from their jobs — the Probe 
phase. This involved plunging 
into the subject’s mind, and 
sorting out relevant details 
which could furnish extra 
clues. Several Probers had got 
themselves trapped in the 
subject's mind, unable to get 
out because of a mental block 
or insanity. 

It might, however, be un- 
necessary. He flashed a 
thought to the girl in the ad- 
joining room: **Sal, should I 
give him the H-R treat- 
ment ?** 

Answer: ^^Emphatically ! 

He’s hiding something. Not 
intentionally, but it needs to 
be uncovered. A superficial 
scanning of the preconscious 
doesn’t get the job done.** 

Keller sighted. The Probe 
(also called the H-R treat- 
ment; because a c e r tain 

-f 

92 


amount of hypnotism was in- 
volved) was trying on not 
only the subject but also the 
scanner. He said: 

“Now, Mr. Radcliffe, I’m 
going to go into your subcon- 
scious mind and get your im- 
pressions of last night. I want 
you to concentrate on...Tt’s 
say . the moment when you 
saw your wife.” He shut off 
all of his five senses, and took 
the plunge. 

The image formed : 

Shrieking terror. A tinge of 
ozone in the air. The Creature 
creeping up from behind. A 
beheaded teddy bear lying full 
length on the floor. A hole in 
the air near the door, colored 
red. Floating demon — where? 
Nonononono! The Creature 
bending over him. Terror — 
heat. No! THE MAN WHO 
FLEW. Melting walls. The 
door (now violet) disintegrat- 
ing. The teddy bear shrivel- 
ing now — turns into a snake — 

He emerged. 

Before he could take full 
control of his body, a thought 
came : 

**Rick? How did you come 
out ?** 

He flashed her the image. 
**Lousy. I can’t get a true im- 
pression-picture to save my 
life. Just a lousy nightmare, 
fantasy-symbolism deal. But I 
did get something out of that 
mess. I’ll let you know about 
it as soon as I verify it.**

when Keller < had * stopped 
talking until rights now,, aq 


by Charlcfe IX Cuhitf ngbam Jr; 



Keller opened his eyes and 
frowned in thought, no time 
had elapsed. In actuality, the 
time taken was one and one- 
half microseconds. 

Keller flashed : **Sally, 

tune in on this conversation, 
please.** 

“Radcliffe,” he said slowly, 
“When did you lose your 
sight ?” 

The other man sat up rigid- 
lv, then relaxed. 

“How did you find out? 
Did you scan it?” 

“No. When I was receiving 
your impressions, I caught an 
idea of melting walls. Then 
there were nameless creatures 
and demons floating around. 
I examined your senses when 
I came out, and saw that you 
were blind. What is it — sort 
of a sight perception-tuning 
sense ?” 

Radcliffe nodded. “I can 
sense everything except col- 
ors. Everything seems black, 
white and gray to me.” He 
paused wearily. “Otherwise, 
there’s no difference. No one 
else knew about it. Not even 
my wife.” 

Keller nodded. “Now, let’s 
try it again. Concentrate on 
the moment when you entered 
here and saw me for the first 
time.” 

He flashed a thought to Sal- 
ly. **Those Creatures were 
his fear of the unknown. He’s 
got a lot of fright in there. 
Probably afraid that the killer 
would jump out at him from 
some shadowy corner. I don’t 
quite see how he could visual- 

# TMC MAN WHO FLEW 


ize different colors, having 
never seen them before — but 
that’s probably my interpreta- 
tion of them. Here goes.** 

The image : 

Heat. Light. The teddv bear 
rising up again. Fear. THE 
MAN WHO FLEW. The 
snake again — coiling — strik- 
ing — missing. Fleeing. Dying. 
Melting walls. Voices around 
him — laughing — shrieking. 
Colors of the rainbow. The 
creature d y i n g — dead — dis- 
solving. No more... 

Voices again. Talking to 
him. Telling him — what? His 
life flashing before him — 
stopping. His brain — undress- 
ing ? Hole in the air at — the 
desk? Fear. THE MAN 
WHO FLEW. Fear-terror- 
hate-revenge . determina- 
tion . 

** Sally? Did you catch all 
that mess?** 

**Unfortunately.** 

**Something’s ^wrong, Sally, 
I should be seeing something 
akin to the actual events 
through his eyes. Instead all 
I get is this meaningless stuff 
— unless — oh, God, now I 
see !** Pause. **I wonder who 
the Man Who Flew is?** 

** You’ve got me. And how 
about the dissolving crea- 
ture?** 

**That shows his confir 
dence in having someone to 
tell his story to. All his utv* 
known fear is vanishing.** 

**And then there’s the hole 
in the air.** 

**Yeah, I think TH surface 



again, and try some straight 
questions on him.** 

A D C L I F F E,” began 
Keller, ‘‘you haven’t re- 
ported this to the police, have 
you?” 

Radcliffe grinned. “Hardly. 
That would start the biggest 
scandal in years. I want it 
kept quiet until we found out 
who killed her.” 

“Well, we’ve ruled out acci- 
dental murder. You found no 
hand-gun in the room when 
you searched it?” 

“No firearm of any kind.” 

Keller nodded. He let his 
mind drift back over four 
years — 

To a time when he was in 
love with Mildred Simmons 
and had proposed to her... 
and she had rejected him, say- 
ing she loved Harold Rad- 
cliffe. 

He had walked away, a bit- 
ter man. She had had many 
enemies, he mused, and almost 
as many friends. He did not 
know of anyone who knew her 
who was not either violently 
for or violently against her 
and all that she stood for. 

He looked up. 

“How old was your wife 
when she died?” 

“T h i r t y-one. Two years 
younger than I am.” 

“Do you know of anyone 
who would want to kill her?” 
It was a routine question, but 
to Keller it was very impor- 
tant. 

94 


“No. I knew many people 
who disliked her intensely — 
I’m not denying that — but not 
to the point of murder. Of 
course, she wasn’t around me 
half the time. I might not 
know.” 

“Well, Radcliffe, I think 
that’ll be all for today. Mind 
if I go with you back to your 
apartment to look it over?” 

“I don’t live there any 
more. I moved out after I had 
disposed of her body. I 
couldn’t stand to live there 
any longer.” 

Radcliffe shook hands and 
departed. Keller read confi- 
dence and positiveness that 
he, Keller, would come 
through. Keller was not so 
sure. He decided to have a 
look around Radcliffe’s apart- 
ment. 

He strolled aimlessly 
around the apartment for a 
few moments, pausing here 
and there to check details 
which might or might not 
help him in analyzing the 
Radcliffes’ character: furni- 
ture design, carpeting, ther- 
mostat setting, toilet articles 
and so on. Then he got down 
to a thorough examination of 
the room. 

There were no secret panels 
or trapdoors of any kind. So 
entrance by a hithertofore un- 
known passageway was com- 
pletely out. He checked the 
air conditioner to see if any 
rigmarole could be fixed up 
with it to make it appear that 

by Charles D. Cunningham, Jr; 



the victim had been shot with 
a handgun, but this, too, drew 
a blank. 

After a few more minutes’ 
examination, he decided to re- 
turn. 

On an impulse, he decided 
to see where Radcliffe had 
gone. Attuning his mind to 
the already-recorded pattern 
of Radcliffe’s brain, he re- 
ceived direction, distance and 
motion — acceleration, direc- 

tion, rate. 

To his surprise he noted 
that Radcliffe had turned 
back and was heading toward 
Keller’s office again. 

Hastily, Keller returned to 
the office before him. 

I N about twenty minutes, 
Radcliffe barged in as be- 
fore. “Keller,” he said, “I 
think I’m going to be called 
out of tov/n tonight. So if you 
want any more information di- 
rectly from me, you’ll have to 
get it now.” 

Keller flashed: **Sally. 
Watch his conscious thoughts, 
and also his impressions. I’m 
going to try some unconscious 
identification-response. Wish 
me luck. Or do you want to 
burrow around in his sub- 
conscious with me a little 
more?** 

**I think I will. I’m actual- 
ly beginning to enjoy it, to 
tell the truth.** 

Keller said aloud, “I’ll go 
under ^again. That’ll be the 
last time.”

But Keller’s reply was cut 
short by a cry of terror in his 
brain.

It was Sally. 

K ELLER went down imme- 
diately. 

**What?** No response. 
**WHAT ?** Still no re- 
sponse. Then he could hear 
her cry — fading in depth — 
now dying — gone.

Coming out of his Probe, 
Keller saw the result of his 
last implanted thought: Rad- 
cliffe, now in a tight fetal 
ball, lay on the floor. 

His face was absolutely de- 
void of expression. His con- 
scious mind was a constant 
gobble-gobble-gobble. 

Keller entered the next 
room, to find Sally sprawled 
limply across her desk. Mind- 
less, soulless, as if she had 
never had a mind or soul— 
Keller lifted her tenderly 
onto the floor and chose the 
*no6t merciful way out, disin- 
tegrating her body with an 
atomic gun from the closet. 

Then, again, the Probe.

Frantically, Keller defend- 
ed himself, throwing up block 
after block, only to have it 
torn down by the ever-spread- 
ing bolts of pure mental en- 
ergy. Finally he withdrew 
into his own body in haste, re- 
alizing that Radcliffe’s con- 
quest would mean his revival. 

W HEN he opened his eyes, 
Radcliffe was sitting in 
the chair, yawning. 

Probably, Keller thought, 
he had no knowledge of his 
fetal state. Good. “Well, Rad- 
cliffe, ” he said, “I need only 
one more thing to complete 
the picture. Now focus again 
on 11:17 last night, when you 
found your wife dead on the 
floor."

into an A-3 — just below Kel- 
ler — thanks to... Sally. 

He analyzed the symbols.

THE POPOFF 


BY THEODORE STURGEON 


W E are an inveterate, 
habitual, addicted radio 
listener: were you able to ab- 
sorb all that passes through 
this wrinkled bearded jelly as 
it crystallizes these syllables 
on the paper for you, you 
might be hard put to it to 
separate the science, science 
fiction, science-fantasy and 
aheer opinion which is intend- 
ed for you, from the cascade 
of cacaphonies cavorting co- 
incidentally amongst the self- 
same cerebral viscosities. 
Working without the radio 
long ago became a total im- 
possibility, and others beside 
ourselves have assigned vari- 
ous reasons to this. One says 
we set up a barrier of noise 
between us and the world, 
and then mentally tune the 
noise out, leaving us a species 
of tomblike (or womblike) 


privacy. Another says chronic 
radio-listening is due to 
anxiety: it indicates that we 
want to be forewarned when 
the whole shebang whee- 
bangs. Still another suggests 
that given a choice between 
work and distraction, we 
probably prefer distraction 
and use the perpetual purr as 
instant interruption, as con- 
venient as our omni-present 
coffee automatic pot. 

We know, of course, which 
of these analyses are correct: 
they all are. There is, howev- 
er, another reason not readily 
apparent unless you see our 
personal cave for yourself. 
For attached to the ubiquitous 
radio is a tape recorder, also 
always in the "on” condition. 
A function switch ties in the 
radio, a microphone, the tele- 
vision and the intercom to the 




house; the recorder is there- 
fore a p.a. system and a sec- 
ond speaker, or poor man’s 
stereo. However, to record 
anything of interest to self, 
wife, friends, children or lo- 
cal organizations, all that is 
needed is to reach out and 
pull the handle. A surprising 
potpourri gradually gathers 
on the tape, until at last it is 
full and needs to be erased. 
Wiping the tape is always an 
interesting duty. Among frag- 
ments of battle between Jack 
Paar and William F. Buck- 
ley, a couple of long cadenzas 
from a bass-player named 
Slam Stewart, a thumping at- 
tack on the United Nations 
by an organization called 
Lifeline, an extemporaneous 
bed-time story by our 5-year, 
old about a duck who liked 
horses so much she ate three 
before lunch and our brother 
arguing with Lester del Rey 
about intelligence tests on an 
all-night talkfest called The 
Long John Nebel Show; 
amongst all these and others, 
then, are snatches of overseas 
radio — Prague, Rome, Saudi 
Arabia, Ecuador and Radio 
Moscow. 

Radio, you know, (and if 
you don't, Moscow will often 
inform you) was invented by 
a Russian named Popoff. 
Whether Popoff ever heard 
of Marconi, Hertz, Arm- 
strong, Edison, Crookes or 
Sarnoff is not known. That 
Radio Moscow never heard of 
them is certain. Anyway, they 
put put a monstrous signal on 

THE POPOFF 


seven frequencies or more, 
and they let you in on won- 
derful worlds of science, of 
fiction and of fantasy. Their 
tone is that of rectitude and 
certainty. You’d think from 
listening to a single program 
that never in life had they 
contradicted themselves. 

W IPING the tape one day 
in May, we ran across 
one recording we’d like to 
share with you, because per- 
haps you’d like to venture an 
opinion as to whether it’s sci- 
ence, science fiction, just 
plain fiction or fantasy. 

We wish we could share the 
voice as well. It is female, 
well modulated, with an al- 
most indescribable slight ac- 
cent. Know how certain Eng- 
lishmen speak without mov- 
ing the upper lip? .This gal 
sounds as if she doesn’t move 
her lower lip, and we’d love 
to see how she does it: 

“Now we’d like to tell you 
how Soviet Scientists pro- 
pose to de-charge the radia- 
tion zone around the earth 
for purposes of space flight. 
Until recently it was believed 
that the principal danger to 
space flight was collision 
with a meteorite. However, 
the most recent research has 
shown that this danger was 
overestimated. However, an- 
other danger has become ap- 
parent. That is the radiation 
zone around the earth con- 
taining the high-energy parti- 
cles known as protons. Au- 
thors of science fiction in de- 

99 



scribing their heroes’ flights 
through interplanetary space 
often write of their attempts 
to protect themselves from 
this danger. As a rule, the 
methods used are on the prin- 
ciple of creating a powerful 
protective field around the 
rocket. This is not the best 
solution of the problem. A 
better idea is to do away with 
the radiation altogether, 
thereby changing the condi- 
tions of space flight. Such a 
proposal is based on perfectly 
practical calculations... The 
radiation zone. .is created by 
the very same protons which 
are the basis of hydrogen 
atomic nucleus. They need 
only to be supplied v/ith elec- 
trons to be converted into 
electrically neutral atoms. 

These will not be subject to 
any pull by the earth’s gravi- 
tic field and will become rap- 
idly diffused throughout 
space. Electrons can be sup- 
plied by [sic] the protons in 
the radiation zone by using 
what is called an electronic 
cannon which, as it were, 
fires them at great speed in 
the required direction. An 
electronic cannon with a ca- 
pacity of only fifty kilowatts 
could do away with the radi- 
ation zone in 24 hours. The 
electronic cannon could be 
placed best on an artificial 
satellite and supplied with 
energy from solar batteries, 
and since the radiation zone 
apparently is capable of be- 
ing restored, the cannon 
would have to be put in ac- 


tion periodically by signals 
from earth.” 

Now the Popoff (a term of 
endearment used slangily by 
Russians, as once we referred 
to “the Marconi”) here per- 
forms some fantasy greater 
even than the fact that it nev- 
er heard of Van Allen either. 
For at this writing, the news 
is full of Russian objections 
to our high-altitude atomic 
tests over* Johnson Island. 
And one of the reasons for 
their objection is — and we as- 
sure you, it’s as flatly, as 
positively stated as any of the 
above — that their calculations 
show that such explosions 
could damage the belt! 

What is it in the Commu- 
nist mentaliiy that makes it 
behave with such transparent 
childishness — the childishness 
which always wins in its re- 
ports of its adventures, which 
actually believes that its lis- 
teners selectively forget the 
lies and the contradictions, 
and is so sure that they can 
really see pictures drawn with 
all light and no shade? The 
worst of our comic books tell 
this sort of story. 

Some view-with-alarmists 
point out that Soviet radio, 
in sheer coverage, outpoints 
us 12 or 14 to 1, and that they 
spend more money jamming 
our broadcasts than we do in 
sending them. Maybe on so- 
ber second thought we should 
leave them to it. All we need 
to do to reduce their propa- 
ganda to zero is to list to it.

IF # Short Story 


Everybody likes fried 
eggs for breakfast — 
but would a chicken? 


TOO MANY EGGS 


BY KRIS MELVILLE 


/^OXE, an unusually phleg- 

matic citizen, came to buy 
c the new refrigerator in the 
usual fashion. He was looking 
for a bargain. It was the latest 
model, fresh from the new 
production line in Los An- 
geles, and was marked down 
considerably below standard. 
The freezing compartment 
held 245 lbs. of meat. 

“How come so cheap ?” 
Coxe wanted to know. * 
"Frankly,” the salesman 
said, "I asked myself that. 
Usually there's a dent in them 
or something, when they have 
that factory tag on them. But 
I checked it over and I can't 
find anything wrong with it. 


However, she goes as is.” 

"At that price,” Coxe said, 
"I'll take it.” 

It arrived, refinished in a 
copper color to his specifica- 
tions, the following Tuesday. 
It was plugged in and operat- 
ed perfectly. He checked it 
out by freezing ice cubes. 

Wednesday evening, when 
he opened the door to chill 
some beer, there was a pack- 
age in the freezing compart- 
ment. He took out the pack- 
age. 

It was some sort of plastic 
and appeared to contain fish 
eggs. 

Coxe had not seen fresh 

101 


fish eggs, considered by some 
a delicacy, for a number of 
years. 

He chilled the beer and 
fried the eggs. 

Both tasted about right. 

The following Friday, his 
girl friend came over to fix 
dinner for him, and when she 
looked in the freezing com- 
partment, she said, “What’s 
this?” . 

“Fish eggs,” Coxe said. 
“How many of them?” 

“Two packages.” 

“We’ll fry them up for 
breakfast,” he said. 

Saturday morning, there 
were three packages of eggs 
in the refrigerator. 

“Where do they come 
from?” his girl friend wanted 
to know. 

“They just appear. I ate 
some and they’re very good.” 

She was reluctant, but he 
talked her into preparing a 
package. 

She agreed they were very 
good. 

“What are you going to do 
about it?” she asked. 

“I don’t think there’s any- 
thing to do about it,” he said. 
“I like fish eggs.” 

On Sunday, the package 
they had eaten Saturday had 
been replaced. They were 
coming in at a steady rate of 
one a day. Coxe cooked a 
package for breakfast and 
took the other two to his 
parents. 


By Tuesday, he was getting 
tired of the eggs, and by the 
end of the week, he had four 
more packages. He succeeded 
in giving two packages to the 
neighbors. 

At the end of another week, 
he had eight packages. 

He explained to his girl 
friend. She suggested they 
visit all their friends, leav- 
ing a package with each of 
them. 

At the end of another two 
weeks, this method for dis- 
posing of the eggs had worn 
thin. They finally managed to 
give the last two packages to 
the landlady. 

At the end of still another 
week, there were seven more 
packages. Otherwise, the re- 
frigerator was a good buy. 

Coxe calculated that, at the* 
present rate, had he left the 
packages in the compartment, 
it would have been filled by 
the end of the month. He felt * 
that once that point was 
reached, the eggs would stop 
coming. Should this prove to 
be incorrect, he was prepared 
to arrange for some method of 
commercial distribution for 
the product. 

On schedule, the eggs 
stopped coming. 

He waited two days. No 
more came. It was over. 

He ate the last package. 

T HE refrigerator worked 
perfectly, and, he began to 
stock it with things freezers 


102 


by Kris Melville 



are conventionally stocked 
with. 

It was almost two weeks af- 
ter the last package had ap- 
peared, early one Sunday 
morning, when the doorbell 
rang. 

At the door was a small, 
nondescript man with a 
vaguely — and really indefin- 
ably — unpleasant aspect. His 
head was bandaged. 

“Mr. Coxe?” he asked. 

“That’s me.” 

“May I come in?” 

“Come on.” 

The man seated himself* 
“Something terrible has hap- 
pened,” he said. “A horrible 
mistake has been made.” 

“I’m sorry to hear that. You 
look as if you were in an ac- 
cident.” 

“I was. I’ve been in the... 
hospital. .. for nearly two 
months. But to come to the 
point, Mr. Coxe. I've come 
*&bout the refrigerator you re- 
cently purchased. It was a 
special refrigerator that was 
erroneously shipped out of 
the plant as a second. When I 
didn’t come in, it got shipped 
out and sold.” 

“Good refrigerator,” Coxe 
said. 

“Perhaps you’ve noticed... 
ah. .something unusual about 
it?” 

“It runs okay. For a while 
there were a bunch of pack- 
ages of fish eggs in it.” 

“Fish eggs!” the little man 
cried in horrot. After he had 
recovered sufficiently, he 
asked, “You dp, of course you 


do, I’m sure you still have all 
the. .little packages?” 

“Oh, no,” said Coxe. 

“NO? Oh, my God. What 
did you do with them, Mr. 
Coxe?” 

“Ate them.” 

“You. .ate. .them? Ate — ? 
No. You didn’t. Not all of 
them. You couldn’t have done 
that, Mr. Coxe. Please tell me 
that you could not have done 
that.” 

“I had to give a lot of them 
away, and everybody said they 
were delicious. And really... 
Uh, Mr.—? Mr., uh. ..” 

The little man got unsteadi- 
ly to his feet. His face was 
ashen. “This is horrible, hor- 
rible.” He stumbled to the 
door. “You are a fiend. All 
our work. .all our plans... 
and you, you...” He turned 
to Coxe. “I hate you. Oh, I 
hate you.” 

“Now, see here.” 

“...Mr. Coxe, you’ll never 
realize the enormity of your 
crime. You've eaten all of us!” 
With that, he slammed the 
door and was gone. 

Coxe went back to the other 
room. 

“Who was it, honey?” 

“Ah, some nut. Seems he 
had first claim on the refrig- 
erator.” 

“I’ll bet it was about the 
fish eggs.” 

“Yeah, he wanted them.” 

“Oh, dear. Do you think he 
can do anything to us?” 

“I don’t think so, not now. 
It’s too late,” Coxe concluded. 
“We ate them all.” END

THE DRAGON-SLAYERS 


Got any dragons to kill? Here’s 
the fastest — and wildest — way! 

BY FRANK BANTA 


I N a gleaming chrome and 
glass federal building lo- 
cated at the center of Venus- 
port, Division Chief Carl 
Wattles wearily arose from 
his office couch. He had been 
taking his usual two-hour, af- 
ter-lunch nap, but today it 
had brought him little re- 
freshment. Earlier he had re- 
ceived an unexpected report 
that made sleep impossible. 
“John?” he mumbled. 

John Claxson, the generous- 
ly padded assistant division 
chief, stopped drilling out his 
earwax but did not remove his 
feet from the blotter of his 
desk. “Yeah, Chief?” 

“I’ve heard from the Ken- 
tons again.” 

“I thought something was 
deviling you, the way you 
was carrying on in your 
sleep.” He raised thick eye- 
brows. “Is their production 
down again?” 

* 4 Worse than that, John. 
Kenton has had the gall to 
request time off to build a 
new house!”

“No! I can’t believe it.” 

“I can’t either, John. They 
know it’s not in the Manual.” 
“Certainly it’s not, Chief. 
The nerve of those people 
wanting to do something 
that's not in the Manual !” 
“People like us wrote the 
Manual, John,” the Chief add- 
ed with simple modesty. 
“That is why it is so good, 
good, good.” 

“I know,” said John, accept- 
ing the weight. Then he com- 
plained bitterly, “Wanting to 
build a new house ! They are 
supposed to do personal stuff 
at night, of when it's rain- 
ing. 

The Chief allowed his rage 
to climb. “They’ve got noth- 
ing to do but go out into the 
jungle and pick a little old 
bale of pretzins every day, 
but do you think they are go- 
ing to do it? No. They want 
me to go and do it for them!” 
“You can’t do it, Chief!” 
protested John. 

■ M Y ou know I can’t/ J ohn,” 
agreed ■ Wattles • as he 


stretched. “I got all I can 
manage right here. More/' 

“What you got to do. 
Chief ?” John asked curiously, 
forgetting caution for a mo- 
ment. 

“Plenty !” retorted the 
Chief. 

“I guess you have at that,” 
John admitted, getting back 
aboard. 

“Time was,” brooded the 
Chief, “when that Kenton was 
a fair pretzin finder. But all 
he can think of to do now is 
to find excuses to goldbrick. 
Wait until he sees the stiff 
memorandum I’m sending 
him. .” 

B LISS Kenton had not gone 
far from their Venusian 
jungle cabin that morning be- 
fore the vacuum snake hung 
one on her. The thick, two- 
foot-long pest lay very still 
on the ground, and she only 
got a glimpse of it before it 
jumped. Out it whipped to its 
full, slim, six-foot length and 
wrapped around her throat. 
Fangs struck, and in three 
seconds — with a loud slurp — 
it had withdrawn a quart of 
her blood. Then it unwrapped 
just as swiftly as it had come, 
and leaped into the cover of 
the jungle. 

The hefty young matron 
wobbled back to the cabin. 

“Pole !” she called as she 
hurried ip. “I've been 
slurped!” 

“Again?” her lanky husband 
asked, looking up from the 
reports on his desk. 


“I’m so sorry f Pole," sha 
said contritely. 

“Well, sit down and start 
recovering, Bliss,” he said in 
a kindly manner. “You can't 
pick any pretzins today.” 

“But I wanted to pick pref- 
zins, Pole. Darn that vacuum 
snake and his fast draft.” 

“I just hope the neighbor- 
hood dragon doesn’t come 
around while you’re in that 
weakened condition, Bliss,” 
Pole worried as he totaled up 
the month’s production on his 
reports. He decided, “I had 
better take time off from 
pretzin hunting today so I can 
be handy to help you with 
your getaway, if need arises.” 

“Oh, the dragon never both- 
ers us,” Bliss said uneasily. 

“He has gotten close enough 
to burn up several of our 
pretzin patches, though. He 
may get to this cabin some 
day.” 

“He doesn’t mean any 
harm,” defended Bliss. “I’m 
sure he wouldn’t want to eat 
us. They are known to be 
strictly vegetarians.” 

“No, he won’t eat us. He’ll 
cook us, unless we can run 
away fast enough — but he’ll 
never eat us.” 

They heard a faraway 
sound. 

“What is that crisp crack- 
ling that sounds like a dank 
forest burning?” wondered 
Bliss. 

Pole scrambled to the door, 
“The dragon is coming! He’s 
headed straight for this cab- 
in r 


THE DRAGON-SLAYERS 


J2S 



“Shall we be going ?” asked 
Bliss, grabbing her clothes. 

A few minutes later, at a 
distance of a thousand yards, 
Pole and Bliss, loaded with 
all their portable possessions, 
watched their cabin burst into 
flames as a roaring, forty-foot 
lizard, with fifty-foot flames 
gouting from his mouth, am- 
bled through their clearing. 

“There, he’s gone,” said 
Pole as the dragon passed on. 
“I’d better put out the fire.” 

Dipping water from a near- 
by pond with a bucket, Pole 
had, after fifty-three fast 
buckets, a blackened ruin of 
what had formerly been their 
rude jungle cabin. 

Pole moved a new, nearly 
finished split-pole settee he 
had been working on back in 
the jungle to their front 
porch. As they seated them- 
selves, he complacently sur- 
veyed the slits burned be- 
tween the charred boards of 
the walls and roof. “The roof 
will leak a mite when it rains, 
but it will let in ^ts of light,” 
he observed optimistically. 

“There’s nothing like lots 
of light,” Bliss agreed. 

“Charcoal is healthful, too.” 

“It absorbs poison like no- 
body’s business !” 

“However, since it rains 
every day on Venus we will 
have to have a new cabin.” He 
sighed resignedly. “And you 
know what that means : Low- 
er production, fewer of the 
magical, antibiotic pretzins. 
I’d better radio the Division 
Chief” 


A S the jet plane flashed 
across their vision, the 
Kentons saw a tiny bundle 
drop from it. Pole ran out 
into the jungle and was un- 
der the parachute when it 
landed. He came back into the 
clearing unwrapping a pack- 
age. 

“It sure was thoughtful of 
Mr. Wattles to answer so 
fast,” said Pole, as he opened 
the little package. “And will 
you look here in the middle ! 
He even sent us a present!” 
“It’s a beautiful, plain 
white, rectangular carton of 
approximately three by seven 
inches,” she said breathlessly. 

“But we mustn’t be selfish,” 
Pole reminded hastily. “Let’s 
see what Mr. Wattles has to 
say in his memorandum here 
first.” They both read the 
green memorandum. 

To: Napoleon B. Kenton, 
Special Agent, Pret- 
zin Division, Venus

vision, Venusport,

In a radio message

sonal problems you were

stated that delays might 
be encountered in your 
harvesting of pretzins.

these misfortunes may be 
overcome during leisure 
hours and should be soon 
resolved without loss of 
a measurable part of your 
productive time. 

Pole interrupted his read- 
ing to beam at his wife. “He's 
sorry for us, Bliss, and he 
hopes things will be better 
for us soon.” 

“Isn’t he the nicest man?” 
They read on. 

In your radio message 
you refer to difficulties 
you are having with a 
snake and a lizard (which 
you colloquially refer to 
as a dragon). It is be- 
lieved that the enclosed 
package, serial number 
93G-18, will cope with the 
matter, and that no fur- 
ther report will be neces- 
sary with respect to 
snakes and lizards. 

Carl Wattles 

Chief, Pretzin Division 

Eagerly Bliss Kenton 
opened the plain white carton 
bearing the serial number 
93G-18. She slid out the two 
and three-quarter by six and 
one-half inch fumigation 
bomb can. 

Bliss read the label. “ ‘Liz- 
ards and snakes go ’way and 
stay. Only $1.19 F. O. B. 
U. S. A.’ Why, it rhymes!” 
she said, a wondering smile 
lighting her face. 

“Does it say how long the 
lizards are that go ’way and 

THE DRAGON-SLAYERS 


stay?” Pole asked anxiously, 
thinking of the neighbor- 
hood's forty-foot hellion. 

“All lizards, it says. And 
only $1.19. 

“Good ! But how about 
snakes that can jump ten feet 
and wrap around your 
throat?” 

“I read that wrong,” she 
amended. “All lizards and 
snakes. And only $1.19.” 

“I’m glad,” said Pole, chok- 
ing up. 

“The Division Chief has 
been thinking of us,” said 
Bliss, wiping away a tear. 

“He knows we field person- 
nel have our problems.” 

“He knew just what we 
needed,” lauded Bliss. 

Pole looked up from the 
canister as he heard a sound. 
“And here comes the dragon 
back! Our lizard repellent ar- 
rived just in the nick of 
time !” 

Down the rain-forest aisle 
the roaring mammoth rapidly 
waddled. Its flames — even 
longer than its body — with- 
ered into blackened ruin all 
that stood before it. This 
time, instead of snatching up 
their possessions and fleeing 
to safety, the Kentons stood 
their ground with their pock- 
et-size fumigation bomb that 
had been designed for pocket- 
sized lizards. When the drag- 
on was within throwing dis- 
tance, Pole flipped on the 
spray jet of the tiny bomb 
and threw it as straight as he 
could. Then both of them sped 
away, leaving all their pos- 

127 





sessions at the mercy of the 
advancing, ravening flames. 

Pole! Isn’t our new 
V-J home just the dandiest 
that a Venusian pretzin-gath- 
ering couple ever had?” 

“It is dandy,” concurred 
Pole. “Who’d ever have 
thought we would have a cab- 
in that was only an inch 
thick, and yet was absolutely 
water tight?” 

“The table makes a dandy 
smokestack too, when it’s 
propped up. Fireproof.” 

“How about the mouth 
when it’s propped open?” 
challenged Pole. “Who could 
beat a front porch like that?” 
“You can’t. You just can’t!” 
“Correct.” He ruminated, 
*We’d never have been able 


to cut the hide. Not a tough, 
inch-thick one like this one.” 
“I’ll never get over the way 
you gutted the dragon. You 
cut him loose inside, just be- 
low the tonsils — ” 

“And after I lassoed them, 
I gave a run — ” 

“And all his guts came 
stringing out!” 

“Had him cleaned to the 
bone within an hour ! i d 
Pole proudly. 

“We would never have had 
it so good if it hadn’t been 
for Mr. Wattles’ helpfulness,” 
reminded Bliss. “That fumi- 
gation bomb, besides making 
a horrible stink — ” 

“ — explodes when it enters 
a dragon’s flaming mouth — 
and blows his methane tanks.”

your help in running down 
the title, author and publisher 
of the story I have outlined 
below. (I might add that this 
story is being considered as a 
feature fijm and the author 
would benefit greatly if the

A mari lives on an island. 


hunts live men. He gets his 
prey, as I remember, by caus- 
ing shipwrecks on the island. 
An elaborate hunt is arranged 
with the victim given various 
aids, such as a knife, map, etc. 
As I remember, the hunter 
uses bow and arrow; and I be- 
lieve too that dogs are used in 
tracking the victim.
