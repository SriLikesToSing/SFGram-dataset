EDITOR^S PAGE 



One day I am going to sit down 
and count all the reference points 
to science fiction, past and pres- 
ent, with which Algis Budrys has 
provided Galaxy readers — and 
myself — in Galaxy Bookshelf. I 
am going to do so just to enjoy 
again the unique illumination in 
which he has bathed the scene for 
me and thousands of others. Even 
more impressive than the sheer 
voluminousness of “Ajay’s” 
reading has always been its quali- 
ty. The best of books can be read 
badly — and bad books almost in- 
variably are — but never by 
Budrys. 

The light has been steady. 

Ajay dropped his bombshell at 
the end of his last column {Gal- 
axy, November ’71). For the time 
being he wants to read science fic- 
tion for pleasure, not as a chore, 
and will write no more reviews for 
Galaxy. And the light over Gal- 
axy Bookshelf out. 

It comes on again in this issue, 
with Theodore Sturgeon taking 
over the Bookshelf. I think you 
will find the new light rich, warm 
and brilliant — and at least as 
uniquely compelling as the old. 

It is powered by a depth of in- 
tellect and understanding un- 
surpassed — perhaps even un- 
matched — in the field and to which 
no one who reads this will need an 
introduction. 

• Many of you noted with dismay, 
some with chagrin, that A. 
Bertram Chandler’s Sister Ships 
{Galaxy, Sept. /Oct. ’71) had ap- 



peared a month earlier (our issue 
hit the newsstands in July) in an 
Ace anthology. The accident 
was like all others in that it should 
not have' happened, yet was un- 
avoidable. 

Sister Ships had been scheduled 
and actually set in type for April 
publication in Galaxy. Then 
came the hike in our production 
costs that squeezed Galaxy into 
bimonthly publication and 
Worlds of Tomorrow and Worlds 
of Fantasy into suspension. 
Schedules and inventories had to 
be reshuffled and Sister Ships sat 
on her pad, in type and ready for 
liftoff. September/October Gal- 
axy provided the first new sched- 
ule opening for the story. 

Through some communica- 
tions snafu 1 had not been made 
aware in advance of the Ace pub- 
lication date. By the time their 
anthology reached stands it was 
too late to pull Sister Ships out of 
Galaxy without destroying the 
entire issue — it was in the final 
press stages. 

A substantial percentage of 
stories first published in Galaxy 
and If are subsequently antholo- 
gized, as Sister Ships was original- 
ly scheduled to be. Seven out of 
fifteen stories selected by Don 
Wollheim and Terry Carr for Ace 
Books’ World’s Best Science Fic- 
tion: 1971 came from the Galaxy 
group magazines. 

This is all to the good — and any 
time you want to write on stone 
that the Galaxy people loved the 
Ace people in 1971 — why, go 
ahead. You would be right.

Conscious 
Mind... 



Use these Extrasensory Powers 



■WHY LIMIT YOURSELF TO FIVE 
SENSES? Seeing, hearing, touching, 
smelling, and tasting reveal only a part 
of life and reality. There is a world of 
perception— of greater realization behind 
your outer self. 

Impressions of these extrasensory powers 
occasionally arise in your conscious mind. 
The strange feeling of an impending dan- 
ger— that intuitive flash or hunch with its 
forceful clarity— or receiving the thought 
of another before he has spoken it— these 
are telltale indications of your unused 
potentialities. 

No longer are these something to just 
wonder about and not to discuss. They 
are not supernatural or weird, but natural 



phenomena. To understand , develo p, and 
direct them can transform your whole per- 
sonality. They can provide greater insight 
and power of personal achievement. 

Challen ge these remarks! Write to the 
Rosicrucians, a worldwide cultural or- 
ganization (not a religion) for the facts 
about your extrasensory powers. Stop 
denying the greater part of yourself!

To those who have experienced these 
deeper psychic aspects of self and want to 
learn to bring them into service at will,

A handful of men, women and 
children— forced to survive in 
the realm of pure physics . 



I 

T he departure lounge was half 
full after the coach had left on 
its first trip to the ship, but it had 
not grown any quieter. Excite- 
ment, impatience and natural 
anxiety had combined to raise the 
noise level of every conversation 
until the background music and 
its intended soothing effect were 
obliterated. Ignoring the low and 
sinfully soft couches scattered 
around the large, cool room, the 
remaining passengers for Eury- 
dice clustered about the exit ramp 
like jet travelers bucking for a 
seat by a window. 

No one was paying attention to 
Mercer directly. Relieved, he 
dropped his eyes to the papers he 
had not been studying for the past 
half an hour and wondered if he 
replaced them in his briefcase 
would the act be the signal for the 
passengers to corrie surging over 
to introduce themselves or ask 
questions. He already knew all of 
their names, having memorized 
the passenger list, and his job 
largely consisted of looking after 
them. But right now they were still 
strangers — for the simple reason 
that he did not know which face 
went with any given name, so he 
decided to savor his last remain- 
ing moments of introversion be- 
fore he had to join the ship. 



But no sooner had Mercer made 
this decision and begun to feel 
pleasantly guilty about it than a 
pair of small feet moved into the 
area of floor covered by his down- 
cast eyes and stopped a few yards 
in front of his chair. He looked up. 

Black sneakers, black slacks, 
black tunic and long-visored cap 
which carried an improbable 
quantity of insignia and plastic 
scrambled eggs. The uniform had 
probably been a good fit last 
Christmas, but now it was a little 
short and tight. Even though the 
body overfilling the uniform was 
sturdy and well-nourished, the face 
had the pinched, big-eyed look of 
the overly imaginative, intelligent 
and probably highly nervous 
child. Mercer did not have to read 
the identity patch on the boy’s 
chest to know that this was Robert 
Mathewson — there was only one 
ten-year-old boy on the passenger 
list. 

He and the boy stared at each 
other for a long time, Mercer 
feeling as tongue-tied as the boy 
looked. The sensation was ridi- 
culous, he told himself irritably as 
the silence began to drag and 
both their faces shifted deeper into 
the infrared. This was, after all, 
his first social contact with a 
passenger and one this young 
should be easy — good practice for 
him, in fact. 



H 



GALAXY 




Clearing his throat, he said, “I 
didn’t know that we had been as- 
signed a cadet for this trip, but I 
can certainly use your help — ” 
“Bobby, I told you not to wan- 
der off,” said a voice from behind 
him. It was feminine, harassed 
and belonged, Mercer saw 'as he 
turned, to the boy’s mother. She 
was young, dark-haired, with a 
face subtly distorted by tension 
and worry so that he could not de- 
cide whether she was pretty or 
downright lovely. She rushed on: 
“You were told not to talk to stran- 
gers and that means not making a 
nuisance of yourself to the ship’s 
officers. I’m sorry about this, sir. 
You’re obviously busy and he 
knows better than to — ” 

“It’s quite all right, ma’am,” be- 
gan Mercer, but already she was 
dragging her son toward the 
largest group of passengers, still 
scolding and apologizing and not 
listening to him at all. 

For a few minutes he watched 
the boy in the space officer’s out- 
fit and the mother in the issue 
coveralls the passengers wore 
shipside. The one-piece garb was 
not exactly shapeless — especially 
not on Mrs. Mathewson — but it 
conformed to the dictates of the 
current neo-puritan fashion, 
which insisted on covering the fe- 
male form on public occasions 
from neck to ankles. 



Suddenly restless, Mercer 
stuffed the papers back into his 
briefcase and stood up. He began 
pacing slowly around the empty 
end of the lounge, staring at the 
large, full-color pictures closely 
spaced along the walls so that he 
would not have to look at — and 
perhaps become involved with — the 
passengers. His first contact with 
two of them had not exactly helped 
his self-confidence. 

Like the background music the 
pictures were designed to be re- 
assuring — there was only one 
takeoff A few interior shots and 
the rest showed Eurydice or her 
sister ships coming in to land be- 
neath enormous, brightly col- 
ored dirigible parachutes or float- 
ing in the ten-miles-distant land- 
ing lake and held upright by a 
collar of inflated life pods while 
the passengers slid laughing down 
a transparent tube into a waiting 
boat. The pictures stressed the 
Happy Return rather than the 
Voyage itself, Mercer thought 
synically as he moved to the big 
periscopic window that looked 
out over the field. 

T WO miles away Eurydice stood 
by her gantry, clean but for the 
passenger boarding bridge. Only 
the topmost hundred feet or so of 
the ship proper — comprising the 
control room, crew quarters and 



DARK INFERNO 



9 




the upper members of the struc- 
ture that supported the rotating 
section — were visible. The service 
and life-support modules, water 
tank and nuclear power unit were 
wrapped in boosters. A mile 
farther down the line stood the 
empty gantry that had serviced 
Minerva before her departure 
four months earlier and beyond 
that, rippling faintly in the heat, 
rose a ship identical to Eurydice 
except for its much larger and 
more complex wrapping of boost- 
ers. 

Nobody talked about that par- 
ticular ship and it did not have a 
name. Like the homecoming pic- 
tures scattered around the lounge 
it was meant to be a reassuring 
sight, but somehow it was nothing 
of the kind. 

The only difference between the 
passengers and himself, Mercer 
thought sourly, was that he had 
nobody to talk loudly and nervous- 
ly to. 

‘'Eurydice, sir?” 

He turned to find a hostess 
standing behind him. She was 
wearing one of the old-style 
mirror plastic uniforms — de- 
scribed as pseudo-futuristic by fe- 
male fashion writers and with ani- 
mal growls of appreciation by men 
regardless of occupation — and 
for the first few seconds that was 
all he saw. He was vaguely aware 



of glittering boots, a hat stream- 
lined for mach three and short 
cloak thrown back over shoulders 
that were a flawless, creamy 
pink — and intensely aware of the 
rest of the getup which was 
virtually topless and all but 
bottomless. When he finally raised 
his eyes Mercer discovered that 
she was not just a beautiful 
body — she had a nice face, too. 

“The coach is waiting, sir,” she 
said. Her smile was polite and not 
at all impatient and her eyes were 
laughing at him. 

Mercer nodded and began walk- 
ing briskly toward the exit where 
the passengers were already 
climbing the ramp that led from 
the cool, blast-proof lounge to the 
blistering heat of the surface one 
hundred feet above. She hurried to 
keep pace with him and Mercer 
wondered why until he realized 
suddenly that they were, after all, 
fellow workers, servants of the 
same company, colleagues. The 
realization made it possible for 
him to untie his suddenly knot- 
ted tongue. 

“I’m sorry if I appeared rude 
back there,” he said, trying hard 
to keep his eyes on a level with her 
face, “but it seems to me that, to 
anyone leaving Earth perhaps 
never to return, you make a very 
nice last impression. In fact, if 
there were a little more time be- 



10 



GALAXY 




fore takeoff it would not take much 
to convince me not to leave at all. 
Or come to think of it, when I get 
back in eight months we could 
meet and maybe — ” 

“What you are thinking would 
probably get us both into trouble 
with my husband,” she broke in, 
laughing. “This is your first trip.” 
It was a statement with not the 
slightest suggestion of a question 
mark tacked onto the end. 

Trying to hide his irritation, 
Mercer said, “I didn’t think it 
showed.” 

She was silent while they left the 
lounge and began to mount the 
flat spiral ramp leading to the sur- 
face. Radiation doors interrupted 
the ascending tunnel every twen- 
ty yards and had been dogged open 
so that the hot, dusty air from 
above was already reaching 
down. When she spoke, the last of 
the passengers were out of sight 
and hearing, hidden by the curve 
of the tunnel and their own self- 
generated wall of sound. 

“It shows, sir,” she said 
seriously. “But I’m learning cau- 
tion in my old age. You see, I don’t 
seem to be able to give advice 
without also giving offense. So 
unless I’m asked — ” 

“I’m asking,” said Mercer dryly. 

OHE nodded. “All right. You are 
^the tall, hungry-looking type 



who suits that black rig — but you, 
especially, must be careful how 
you wear it. That rakish angle of 
the hat is wrong for Eurydice and 
some of your pocket zips are done 
and some half-done — you haven’t 
got that right, either, and at this 
stage of the game you shouldn’t 
even try. Even the plays you have 
been watching so carefully on TV 
never get it right, so don’t feel too 
bad about it.” 

Mercer said nothing. 

“This mystique with the zips and 
caps that veteran spacemen prac- 
tice,” she went on, “began as sheer 
sloppiness, no doubt, but now the 
so-and-so’s change the rules after 
every trip just to confuse people. 
But you, sir, are not yet a veteran, 
so it is much better that you don’t 
get it at all than get it wrong. In 
any case, there are two officers on 
every ship who do not subscribe to 
these little idiosyncrasies of dress. 
They are the captain, who is too 
important to care about such 
things and the other is you, sir, who 
are generally considered to be the 
lowest form of life in the service 
and not supposed to get ideas 
above your station. But you know 
all this already, I hope.” 

She was watching him intently, 
but she relaxed when he smiled 
and said, “I was told, but not pre- 
cisely in those words. The general 
idea seems to be that — since our 



DARK INFERNO 



11 




passengers have to be physically 
fit to be allowed to make the trip 
in the first place — my medical 
know-how is not essential and, 
since I have no other specialized 
technical training useful in 
space, my duties will be largely 
those of a steward. The respon- 
sibility for ensuring that the custo- 
mers have a happy and confort- 
able trip is mine, apparently, and 
until now. I’m sorry to say, the 
thought of mixing with and look- 
ing after more than forty healthy 
people has me scared stiff.” 

“You are being too negative, 
sir,” she told him sharply. “You 
may be little more than the ship’s 
steward, but you must not act like 
one or even think like one. And you 
apologized to me twice during, oh, 
five minutes of conversation. 
That’s bad. You must be the 
strong, silent type if you want to 
gain the respect of your charges. 
Failing that you can be the weak, 
silent type — ^just as long as you’re 
silent, reserved, somewhat aloof 
at all times and never tell them 
your troubles. Remember that the 
passengers don’t know that you 
are just a glorified steward and 
they must never suspect that you 
are their servant or your first trip 
will be hell — and your last as far as 
Eurydice is concerned. Because 
if even once you have to go to the 
real officers with a passenger 



prablem your name is mud and 
you’ll never — ” 

She was beginning to sound 
rather emotional, Mercer thought. 

He held up his hand and said, 
“What did I ever do to you?” 

She was quiet for the next dozen 
paces. Then she laughed and said, 
“Not a thing. But you can return 
my favor if you like. I would like 
to have a few extra minutes on 
board. If I could stay up there with 
the first group of passengers while 
you took up the second batch — I 
really would appreciate that, sir.” 

Return what favor? Mercer 
wondered, then thought that her 
advice and criticism had been just 
that even if it had nearly lifted the 
skin off his back. He nodded. 

“Thank you, sir.” 

Definitely the emotional type, he 
thought. 

A few minutes later they reached 
the upper end of the ramp and 
stood blinking in the twin glare of 
the afternoon sun and the mirror- 
bright coach. His dark uniform 
soaked up the heat like a thermal 
sponge and beside him the girl be- 
came a glittering, truncated cone 
as she pulled the cloak around her 
shoulders. 

“Sorry to’ spoil your view,” she 
said, “but I don’t tan in the sun — I 
frizzle up. You take the seat be- 
side mine at the rear — you’ll have 
more leg room — and ignore the

flashing lights on my call panel. 
People always sit on the arm-rest 
buttons while finding a seat. Be 
with you in a minute, sir.” 

Mercer smiled. 

By the time she rejoined him he 
had used the cosmetic mirror set 
into her service panel to adjust his 
cap, which was now absolutely 
straight and as level as the distant 
blue line of the landing lake. He 
had also checked his zips. The 
coach was already picking up 
speed towards Eurydice’s gantry 
and the noise level was keeping 
pace with it. Two seats in front of 
Mercer a man was complaining 
bitterly because the coaches were 
not big enough to move everyone 
to the ship at the same time. An- 
other was insisting that at the 
price this trip was costing his com- 
pany he was damn well going to 
watch the takeoff from a port and 
from farther along the coach two 
different call lights were blinking in 
tandem. 

“It’s high time,” said Mercer, 
rising, “that I started getting to 
know my patients — I mean 
passengers.” 

Her small, strong hand pushed 
him back into the seat. 

“I’ll handle it,” she said. “Until 
they are all trussed up and safe in 
their acceleration couches they are 
my responsibility. Sit there and 
save your strength.” 



B ecause it was a widely ac- 
cepted fact that many people 
could undertake plane trips and 
even interplanetary voyages with- 
out qualms and yet be scared silly 
by three hundred feet of altitude, 
the elevator that took Eurydice’s 
passengers up to the main entry 
lock was completely enclosed. 
But that low-ceilinged, windowless 
cage had a subduing effect, Mer- 
cer noted. It was as if the passen- 
gers realized that they were taking 
their first tiny step spaceward and 
that there was still time to step 
back. Or was he simply putting 
thoughts into the passengers’ 
minds because the same thoughts 
were going through his own? 

The cage was uncomfortably 
crowded, but the passengers were 
somehow managing to keep their 
distances from each other and did 
not even look at him. Starting to 
introduce himself under these 
conditions was impossible — he 
would simply make himself look 
and sound ridiculous. But he could 
at least nod at young Mathewson 
without loss of dignity or doing 
irreparable harm to his image. 

But the boy tried to salute him 
and jabbed a passenger in the 
stomach with his elbow. His 
mother grabbed his arm and be- 
gan apologizing all around and

Mercer retreated behind his per- 
sonal wall of silence wondering, 
as they reached the top and the 
passengers preceded him into the 
ship, if it were possible to project 
an image so strong and silent that 
he would not have to speak to any- 
one at all for the entire four 
months of the trip. 

First Officer Prescott was wait- 
ing just inside the outer seal. He 
ran his eyes quickly from Mercer’s 
cap to his footwear and back 
again, looking faintly surprised, 
but when Prescott spoke he sound- 
ed more than faintly disappointed. 

“I thought you weren’t going to 
make it. What kept you?” 

“I was told to come aboard with 
the last coachload of passen- 
gers — ” began Mercer. But Pres- 
cott was obviously not listening, 
so he concentrated on being 
strong and silent again as he 
passed into the lock antechamber. 
He could feel his face burning, so 
the chances were that he was fool- 
ing nobody but himself. 

The captain was standing just in- 
side the seal, looking cool, correct 
and with his features, if anything, 
stiffer than his erect body. He was 
looking through Mercer and the 
double hull behind him at some 
remembered object or event that 
claimed all of his attention. 

Mercer had met Collingwood 
and the other officers briefly 



during his training and the cap- 
tain had been the only one who had 
not made him feel like crawling 
under the nearest stone. But now 
it looked as if Collingwood were 
angry about something, prob- 
ably the misdemeanour of the 
girl’s having deserted most of a 
coachload of passengers. Per- 
haps one of them had actually 
complained to him about it and 
now she was standing beside the 
captain, looking about to cry. 

Mercer felt sorry for her. She 
was easy to like and even easier to 
feel sorry for and in a way he was 
responsible for her trouble be- 
cause he had agreed to her re- 
quest. He wanted badly to apolo- 
gize, but remembered that she did 
not like people who apologized 
too often. He stopped. The cap- 
tain was still staring into the mid- 
dle distance, not even seeing him. 

“Good-bye, ma’am,” Mercer 
said. 

It came close to being the short- 
est and most uninspired farewell 
of all time, but her reaction 
literally rocked him back on his 
heels. 

“Take care of yourself,” she 
said, standing on tiptoe and 
giving him a warm but sisterly kiss 
on the cheek. Then she looked at 
him seriously and added: “Take 
care of all of them, sir.” 

Mercer had instinctively put his 



14 



GALAXY 




arms around her waist, both to 
keep his balance and because it 
seemed to be the thing to do, then 
let them drop to his sides. She had 
not, he saw, committed some 
trifling misdemeanour and been 
told off for it — there was far too 
much tension and sheer misery in 
her expression. He wondered what 
kind of trouble could make a girl 
with a disposition like hers react 
like this — and if he could help. But 
today he seemed to have left his 
inspiration in his other suit and all 
he could manage was a sickly 
smile and a line of trite dialogue. 

“What about your husband, 
ma’am?” 

“He doesn’t mind,” said the cap- 
tain, “provided you two don’t 
make a habit of it.” Suddenly he 
laughed and the girl began laugh- 
ing, too — the way people did who 
were trying hard not to cry. She 
turned from Mercer to hang a 
stranglehold on the captain’s 
neck. The kiss she gave him was 
anything but sisterly. 

Mercer was still staring at them 
when Prescott’s finger dented his 
shoulder. 

“Are you some kind of voyeur, 
Mercer? We have work to do up- 
stairs.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

lJUT when they had climbed to 
^the passenger level Prescott 



paused for a few moments before 
continuing toward the control 
deck. Pitching his voice low be- 
cause of the passengers lying all 
around them, he said, “They’re all 
yours, Mercer. Keep them quiet 
and comfortable and don’t let any- 
one be sick outside of his plastic 
bag — that is funny only on tele- 
vision. If you should have a prob- 
lem, hesitate before calling on me 
for help — hesitate for as long as 
possible because we will be very 
busy and will not take kindly to do- 
ing your job for you. Under- 
stood?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Prescott shook his head. “You 
have made a great start to your 
first voyage, Mercer, and I 
shudder to think of what you might 
do before it ends. I mean, prac- 
tically making love to the cap- 
tain’s wife before his very eyes — ” 

“At the risk of sounding a cad, 
sir,” said Mercer, “she started 
it.” 

“And another thing, Mercer. We 
do not salute or click heels or call 
anyone ‘sir’ except the captain — 
and he does not insist on it. In- 
visible discipline is what we aim 
for and an air of relaxed informal- 
ity — well, informality anyway. 

Just look after your passengers 
without getting too close to any 
of them and keep out of the way of 
the ship’s officers — ” 



DARK INFERNO

“It looks as if I’ll have a very 
lonely trip, Mr. Prescott,” said 
Mercer quietly, but he was unable 
to keep the anger from showing in 
his tone. 

“In my experience,” Prescott 
replied in a voice that was sar- 
castic rather than actively hostile, 
“people like you take a trip like 
this as a means to an end. In your 
profession space experience auto- 
matically puts you at the head of 
the queue as far as the juiciest re- 
search appointments are con- 
cerned and even in private prac- 
tice it is enough to allow you to 
triple your fees. Perhaps we will be 
lucky — you will stay out of trouble 
with the passengers, keep yourself 
to yourself and spend your free 
time in your cabin studying some 
of those books you brought along.” 
“You’ll be lucky.” 

Prescott ignored both the anger 
and the ambiguity in Mercer’s re- 
ply. 

He said, “I hope so. But you are 
going to have company in a mo- 
ment and I haven’t time to chat, 
even to overexposed ministering 
angels. See you.” 

Mercer turned as the first offi- 
cer continued his climb to the 
cone. The two hostesses who had 
been checking and strapping in 
the passengers on arrival were 
only a little overexposed and 
neither could hold a candle to 



Mrs. Captain. Or maybe it was 
just that his artistic appreciation 
had been deadened by the recent 
exchange with Prescott. He 
nodded, uncomfortably aware that 
his face was still red. 

“The passengers are settled in, 
sir,” said the dark-haired one. “All 
have been given medication, but 
you might keep an eye on Mr. 
Saddler and Mr. Stone, who may 
be trying to prove something — I 
think they palmed their capsules.” 

Mercer nodded without speak- 
ing. 

“Don’t let Prescott bother you, 
sir,” said the blond one, reading 
his expression if not his mind. “He 
is an exceptionally good officer, 
believe it or not, even if he does 
lack charm.” 

“Surely,” said Mercer, “you 
aren’t his mother?” 

The girl laughed. “No, and no- 
body said anyone loves him. But 
we have to go now and separate 
the Collingwoods — the boarding 
gantry swings in inside five min- 
utes. Good luck, sir.” 

“And good hunting,” added the 
other. 

When they had gone Mercer 
stood for a moment looking 
slowly around the passenger deck, 
feeling lonely despite being knee 
deep in a wall-to-wall carpet of 
people, most of whom were star- 
ing at him. This is just like the 



16 



GALAXY 




simulator, he told himself firmly, 
complete with ship noises, muted 
countdown from the wall speak- 
ers, the paint and plastic smell of 
the acceleration couches and the 
pressure of cool, artificially fresh 
air on my face — exactly the same, 
except that the couches were not 
being occupied by bored junior 
clerks from the administration 
building next door and the sounds 
and smells were real. 

His job now was to give real 
comfort and reassurance to his 
charges, not just the simulated 
kind. 

According to the instruction 
book and the psychologist who 
had taken him through it, the job 
was simple. At this stage the 
passengers were already wrapped 
in broad acceleration webbing — 
even the shape of the couches was 
reminiscent of a cradle and the 
calm, competent figure of a ship’s 
officer moving among them was a 
father figure tucking them in for 
the night. Greeting them individ- 
ually by name, making a perfunc- 
tory check on the tightness of their 
straps, asking if they were com- 
fortable and dealing, very briefly, 
with any special problems they 
might have was all that was neces- 
sary to reassure them. His psy- 
chologist-instructor had added 
drily that he would have over 
forty people to process pre-flight- 



wise and less than sixty minutes 
to do it in, so he simply had no 
time to undertake deep analysis. 

Surprisingly the job did prove 
simple. 

WHE couches were laid out par- 
^ allel and with the passengers’ 
heads pointing in the same direc- 
tion, so that they could all watch 
the large projection screen set on 
the underside of the deck above. 
The walking space between them 
was about six inches wide, except 
where the curvature of the inner 
hull allowed more. Mercer 
kneeled briefly beside each couch, 
reading the passengers’ name tag 
as he checked their straps, saying 
the prescribed words and keeping 
an eye on the time by not looking 
at his watch, in the same way that 
he did not seem to be looking at 
the name tags stitched to their cov- 
eralls. He had to give the impres- 
sion of being calm, unhurried and 
concerned with their individual 
welfare, the book said, and 
theoretically he could take all the 
time he needed to ensure his 
passengers’ comfort before take- 
off. This was a passenger ship, af- 
ter all, and a problem with one or 
more of the passengers was the 
only acceptable reason short of a 
serious malfunction for calling a 
Hold. 

But Mercer would have to have a 



DARK INFERNO 



17 




very strong reason for holding or 
the launch-control people would 
have caustic things to say, the cap- 
tain would probably go critical 
and Prescott, who seemed to be a 
pretty poisonous character at the 
best of times, would certainly 
make his life miserable for the rest 
of the voyage. 

“Are you comfortable, Mr. 
Saddler?” Mercer said pleasantly 
to the next in line, then stopped. 
This was one of the tough guys who 
had not taken his medication. 
Mercer stared at the man’s face 
without really seeing it while his 
mind sought in vain for a pleasant 
and friendly way of telling him to 
take his anti-nausea pill and not be 
a fool. By the end of the allotted 
minute Mercer still did not have 
the answer and he saw that the 
passenger’s face was becoming 
apprehensive and that he was re- 
fusing to meet Mercer’s eyes. Sud- 
denly he wriggled sideways in his 
straps so that he could reach his 
breast pocket. 

“I’m sorry,” he mumbled. “I 
nearly forgot to take my pill.” 

“It can happen,” said Mercer 
pleasantly, “in the excitement.” 

The next two couches were 
occupied by the Mathewsons. 
Judging by the glazed look in Mrs. 
Mathewson’s eyes one of the hos- 
tesses had seen fit to slip her a 
small caliber sleep bomb, which 



wa^ already taking effect. Per- 
haps she had been frightened. Her 
son’s eyes were enormous, but not 
with fear. Mercer found himself 
envying the hot, bright, uncom- 
plicated excitement of the boy. 
With Mercer very little still hap- 
pened for the first time. When it 
did happen for the first time — as it 
would in a very few minutes from 
now — the sensation would be 
diluted and deadened by the emo- 
tional impurities of fear and guilt 
and by his maturity and intelli- 
gence which would insist on 
computing his chances of meeting 
disaster during the period of 
maximum stress that was takeoff 
and by the other excitements of his 
short adult life, which had reduced 
his capacity to respond to this one. 
He wondered suddenly if the real 
reason for his being here was the 
fear that if he had stayed put he 
would have used up Earth and 
everything it had to offer and 
joined everyone else in the des- 
perate search for small variations 
on old sensations. 

Mercer smiled. Compared with 
the life most of his friends had led, 
his had been almost monastic. 
Below him Bobby Mathewson 
smiled back. 

The next couch was empty for 
the very good reason that it was 
his own. Beyond it was the one 
belonging to Stone, the other 



18 



GALAXY 




passenger suspected of missing 
out on his pre-takeoff medica- 
tion. Mercer tried the blank stare 
on him which had worked so well 
with Saddler, hoping that the 
man’s guilty conscience would do 
the rest, but Stone simply stared 
back at him. Maybe his con- 
science was clear. Mercer had to 
be content with clearing his 
throat loudly and slipping a plas- 
tic bag between the other’s chest 
straps where Stone could reach it 
quickly. 

They would be different people 
in space, he thought as he gave a 
careful last look around, different 
but not necessarily better. The 
book had gone into great detail 
regarding the odd quirks and out- 
right personality changes — oc- 
curring naturally, of course, and 
not induced by drugs — which 
some people developed during 
space voyage. It went into even 
greater detail about the deep- 
rooted psychological reasons for 
the phenomena. Mercer sighed, 
lay down on his couch and swal- 
lowed his own anti-nausea medi- 
cation while he was strapping in. 

On the screen above him the 
picture of Eurydice and the gantry 
was replaced by a view of the dis- 
tant hills and landing lake as 
someone switched to the on-board 
TV camera. 

He slipped on his headset and 



said, “Mercer. Passenger section 
ready.’’ 

Collingwood’s voice sounded in 
his earpiece. “So I see. But are 
you quite sure that they are all 
settled and medicated? I realize 
that you are keen and are prob- 
ably trying to impress me with 
your efficiency, but I shall not be 
impressed if a lot of passengers 
try to turn themselves inside out 
while we are dumping the 
boosters.” The tone softened a 
little as he went on. “Missing the 
pip is an inconvenience these days 
instead of a disaster. Our launch 
window is as wide as we want it, so 
if anything that might require a 
Hold is worrying you — let’s have 
it, Mercer.” 

While the captain had been talk- 
ing Mercer had been thinking 
about Stone and wondering how 
he could explain his suspicions 
without sounding like a fussy old 
woman. He couldn’t. 

“No problems, sir.” 

“Good. We lift in four min- 
utes.” 

Mercer spent the time checking 
that the vacuum cleaner under his 
couch was handy and worrying 
about the period of weightless 
maneuvering that would begin 
when they went into Earth orbit. 
Both the book and his instructor 
had painted awful pictures of 
weightless nausea running wild. It 



DARK INFERNO 



19 




would become critical, they had 
said, a chain reaction that could 
spread even to those who had taken 
medication, and the job of clear- 
ing the air was difficult and dis- 
tasteful. An incident like that 
was the one thing guaranteed to 
sour the whole voyage. 

He was still worrying when the 
boosters ignited and acceleration 
piled invisible weights on his chest. 
The projection screen showed the 
launch complex and landing lake 
shrinking below them. More and 
more territory crawled in from the 
edges of the screen — the pale cross- 
hatching of a town, the gray 
smears of mountains flattened by 
the near vertical sunlight, tiny 
layers of shadow sandwiched be- 
tween the ground and the clouds. 
He moved his head carefully so as 
to watch Stone. 

Anyone with a TV in his/her liv- 
ing room had seen it all before. 

HI 

wmHis is your captain, ladies 
^ and gentlemen. I hope you are 
comfortable and that you will have 
a pleasant trip. We shall make two 
complete orbits of Earth, during 
which a number of minor course 
corrections will be necessary for 
us to match orbits with Space-Sta- 
tion Three to dump our boosters. 
Please remain strapped in until 



these maneuvers are completed, 
which will be in a little under four 
hours when we reach the vicinity 
of the station. 

“During the next fifteen minutes 
you will notice periodic fogging of 
the picture of Earth’s face being 
projected on your screen,” he went 
on quietly. “This is in all respects 
normal and is caused by the 
venting of surplus fuel from the 
boosters prior to their delivery at 
Three. Thank you.” 

“Roughly translated,” Pres- 
cott’s voice continued in Mercer’s 
ear plug, “nothing out of the 
ordinary is happening except 
that we are slightly off course due 
to our having taken off exactly on 
time. Nobody bothers to do so 
these days and launch control 
doesn’t have to be all that ac- 
curate, either. In the old days this 
sort of thing would have been very 
serious. But not with virtually un- 
limited reaction mass — ” 

“Careful, Bob,” broke in the 
captain’s voice, “or you’ll be 
lecturing again.” 

“Nobody listens,” said Prescott 
shortly and continued. “As a 
result we shall be using booster 
steering power at increasingly 
frequent intervals as we approach 
Three. During the final thirty min- 
utes, Mercer, keep a sharp eye on 
your passengers.” 

“Will do,” said Mercer. “In the 



20 



GALAXY 




meantime we will be weightless 
practically all of the time, as I 
understand it. Have I permission 
to rig the cabin dividers?” 

“Yes,” said Prescott. 

Mercer lay unmoving for per- 
haps a minute, thinking about 
Prescott and the captain. The first 
officer, who was not a pleasant 
personality to begin with, was be- 
ing actively unpleasant, probably 
to remind Mercer firmly and con- 
tinuously that he was a space of- 
ficer in name only. In complete 
contrast was the captain, who was 
patient and considerate and, as far 
as Mercer could see, pleasant to 
everyone, including Prescott. He 
wondered if the other crew mem- 
bers would emulate Prescott or the 
captain in their behavior toward 
their medical officer. He supposed 
that the answer would depend on 
how they had been raised to think 
of second-class citizens. 

But suppose Prescott’s feelings 
toward him were shared by the oth- 
ers — even by the captain — and the 
only difference was that the first 
officer’s reactions were honest 
while those of the others were 
cloaked, for the moment, by sur- 
face kindliness and considera- 
tion. 

Mercer shook his head angrily, 
trying to derail this highly uncom- 
fortable train of thought. Surely he 
could take a little unpleasantness 



for the duration of the trip. Large 
numbers of people on Earth were 
made to feel inferior each and 
every day of their lives. But he still 
felt like giving Prescott an order 
simply to relieve his feel- 
ings — and suddenly there was 
something he could tell the first 
officer to do. He thumbed the 
transmit switch. 

“Mercer. Our TV picture of the 
surface is corkscrewing as well 
as fogging. Too much of that 
might make our passengers feel 
uncomfortable. Can you — ” 

The screen went blank and Pres- 
cott said, “Right. Do you want to 
show a film instead?” 

“I don’t think so,” Mercer re- 
plied. “Watching me trying to tie 
down the cabin dividers should be 
entertainment enough.” 

Before releasing his harness he 
waited to see if Prescott would 
have the last, unpleasant word, 
then decided that Collingwood 
had probably told the first officer 
to go easy on the new man. 

The main supports for the cabins 
were two tough plastic rings just 
over half the interior diameter of 
the passenger module. With the 
four main support ropes and the 
inner spacer lines which kept the 
rings apart, the rings were clipped 
at intervals of a few feet to the 
underside of the deck above so as 
to keep the cordage from coming 



DARK INFERNO 



21 




adrift during acceleration. Mercer 
pulled himself around the anchored 
rings, releasing the fastenings and 
tossing the main supporting ropes 
gently toward the deck below — all 
except the last one, the end of 
which he wrapped around his 
hand. Turning head down, he 
sighted himself at the rope’s lash- 
ing point between two couches 
and, with all eyes upon him, kicked 
out hard. 

In theory the mass and momen- 
tum of his body would draw out the 
double rings, whose inertia would 
slow him to a stop before he 
actually hit the deck. But Mercer, 
who had practiced this operation 
in a ground simulator with a sys- 
tem of weights duplicating the ef- 
fect of weightlessness, had been 
sure that if he kicked too hard he 
would crack his skull on the deck 
or, if his aim were bad, bury it in 
someone’s stomach. As a result 
he was a little too cautious — he 
did not succeed in pulling both 
rings far enough from their hous- 
ing. Instead of reaching the deck 
his misjudged dive stopped a few 
feet above the acceleration 
couches and he began to swing to- 
ward the middle of the compart- 
ment. 

Ignoring the grins as well as the 
eyes watching him, he cleared his 
throat and said, “Would one of you 
mind grabbing my feet?” 



Immediately the deck sprouted a 
forest of clutching hands, which 
eventually succeeded in checking 
his swing. But the rings had begun 
to swing as well, giving him a lot 
more slack on the support rope he 
was holding so that he toppled 
slowly and gently across two 
doubly-upholstered couches, the 
upper layers being female. 

The layer called Miss MacRob- 
erts giggled and the other, whose 
name he could not read because of 
the topological features dis- 
torting her identity patch, said, 
“Pleased to meet you.” 

Mercer apologized gravely and 
began moving back to the lash- 
ing point by gripping the edges of 
intervening couches with his free 
hand and pulling himself along. 
Within a few minutes he had the 
support rope in position and 
pulled taut. 

Above him the two rings swung 
and vibrated slowly, shaking their 
attached cordage into the begin- 
nings of a weightless tangle. 
Mercer dived carefully across the 
deck, snatched the second sup- 
port rope out of the air as he passed 
it and checked himself with his 
free hand against the couch beside 
its lashing point. He was begin- 
ning to get the hang of his task. 

DY THE time the first surge of 
^steering thrust came he had the 



22 



GALAXY 




supporting lines in position and 
was beginning to weave a double 
web of cabin dividers between the 
now rigid rings and the inner skin 
of the hull. His earpiece had 
bleeped a five-second accelera- 
tion warning, so he had plenty of 
time to wedge himself between 
two couches and hold on. But when 
it came the surge was so gentle and 
his grip on the couch edges so tight 
that he felt ridiculous. When a 
double bleep signaled the ces- 
sation of thrust he nodded silently 
to the passengers on each side of 
him and returned to work. 

During the next three hours the 
surges came with increasing 
frequency, but he was usually close 
enough to a bulkhead or one of the 
rings to hold on until they had 
passed — although on one oc- 
casion he misjudged. He ended the 
weightless tumble that followed 
by doing an awkward handstand 
on the edge of someone’s couch. 

It was not easy to maintain a 
pleasantly grave expression or to 
pretend that this sort of activity 
was in all respects normal as he 
murmured, “Sorry, ma’am,” and 
returned, like an industrious — if 
ungainly — spider to weave his 
web. 

Looking incredibly fragile and 
completely purposeless his double 
web neared completion despite 
these interruptions. In the sub- 



orbital configuration and during 
the initial powered stage of their 
trip the thing was simply a highly 
porous obstruction to anyone 
wanting to watch the screen. But 
when the reactor that would give 
them a half-G of thrust for the first 
two days of the flight closed down, 
artificial gravity would be sup- 
plied by spinning the passenger 
section about the longitudinal 
axis of the ship. The walls of the in- 
ner hull would then become the 
floor and the double web would 
support clip-on plastic sheets and 
the passengers would have cabins 
and privacy of a sort. 

The cabins would even be roofed 
over so that crew members mov- 
ing along the weightless axis be- 
tween control and the power 
module aft would not be able to see 
the sort of things reputed to go on 
in passenger-carrying space- 
ships. 

People tended to forget the rules 
when they were far from home, his 
instructor had warned him, and 
the degree of forgetfulness was 
in proportion to the distance. 

His mind was not entirely on his 
job, he realized suddenly, or he 
would not have missed hearing the 
thrust warning. As it was, he 
found the section of support ring 
he was working on moving away 
from him and instinctively 
tightened his grip on the attached 



DARK INFERNO 



23 




line he was holding. 

Just as the line was drawing taut 
against its ring, thrust was applied 
at right angles to the previous surge 
and he began a slow swing around 
the support ring, a swing that 
would ultimately wrap his line 
tightly around the ring. For a few 
seconds this did not worry him, 
but then he realized that as the line 
wound itself tight it would shorten 
and his speed of rotation would in- 
crease — it was already speeding 
up, in fact. With his free hand he 
reached for one of the divider ropes 
as it whirled past, but could only 
touch it. All he succeeded in do- 
ing was to start himself spinning 
on the end of his rope as well as 
describing diminishing circles 
around the ring. 

Dizzy and confused, Mercer 
tried to work out how fast he would 
be traveling by the time his line 
was completely wound around the 
ring. Almost certainly it would be 
too fast for him to transfer his grip 
from the rope to the ring — and if he 
let go at that speed he would go 
bulleting into the deck, bulk- 
heads or passengers like a stone 
from a slingshot. The time to let 
go was now, while he was still mov- 
ing relatively slowly. But his hand 
seemed to have a mind of its 
own — the more he thought of let- 
ting go the stronger became its 
grip on the rope. 



Mercer closed his eyes and tried 
to think. He had more than two 
feet of slack wrapped around his 
hand. If he released that the radius 
of his swing would be increased 
and his rotation slowed. He would 
do just that and hold on to the last 
few inches of rope until he was 
swinging toward the inner hull 
wall, then bend his knees to absorb 
the shock of landing and let go. 

But the end of the rope slipped 
from his hand before he was ready 
and he went tumbling slowly to- 
ward the middle of the deck. For a 
moment he thought that he would 
be fantastically lucky and land on 
his own couch, but instead he 
landed sprawling on the one be- 
side it. 

The passengers began to ap- 
plaud and Mrs. Mathewson said 
crossly, “Do you always try to 
land on defenseless women?” 

“Only the pretty ones, ma’am,” 
Mercer said, before he realized 
that his great relief at not break- 
ing his neck was possibly not 
shared by the passenger he had 
landed on. But before he could 
apologize properly his earpiece 
bleeped a thrust warning and he 
squirmed into his own couch. 

UE HAD the webbing around his 

ankles when thrust tilted him 
gently to one side, then the other,

GALAXY 




couch and twist him at the same 
time. Someone grunted and gave 
an odd-sounding cough. Mercer 
swung around to see the passen- 
ger called Stone rapidly filling 
his plastic bag. 

Stone had been a little late in 
getting the bag to his mouth and 
some of the material was drifting 
above his couch where the next 
surge of acceleration would 
send it flying all over the place. 
With his feet still held by the web- 
bing Mercer undipped the sucker 
from the underside of his couch 
and went after the stuff, pulling it 
into the small but powerful vac- 
uum cleaner and leaving in its 
place a fresh smell of pine trees and 
heather. Then he helped Stone un- 
til the latter had quite finished, 
sponged Stone’s face and pro- 
duced a water tube and an anti- 
nausea pill. 

“Sorry about that, Mr. Stone,” 
he said. “But there are some peo- 
ple who seem to need double the 
usual medication.” 

Stone had the grace to blush. 

“Mr. Mercer,” said Prescott in 
the earpiece. “Attitude maneu- 
vers are completed. Will you come 
to control as soon as conven- 
ient.” His tone was almost polite 
and made Mercer feel uneasy. 

His first impulse was to rush to 
control right away and take what 
was coming to him for his recent 



stupid and dangerous display of 
weightless acrobatics. But ten 
more minutes’ work would com- 
plete the rigging of the cabin di- 
viders and he might just as well go 
up there with one job done proper- 
ly, even if he had nearly killed him- 
self doing it. While he was tight- 
ening the last rope the screen 
above him lit up with a clear, sharp 
and steady picture of space sta- 
tion Three. 

A few seconds later he made a 
slow, careful dive toward the well 
connecting the passenger com- 
partment with control and rose 
past the level of the officers’ cab- 
in and the enclosed ladder used 
when the ship was under power or 
on the ground. He did not bump 
against anything on the way up, so 
apparently his weightless move- 
ments were becoming more ac- 
curate. Even so, he was feeling far 
from confident as he checked his 
dive at the entry to control, made 
sure that his zips were properly 
fastened and that his cap was still 
on straight, and entered. 

Prescott pointed at the empty 
couch and said angrily, “Lie 
there, Mercer. Watch the screens 
or look out through the window. 
Don’t touch anything.” 

Communications Officer Mac- 
Ardle and the engineer, Neil- 
son, looked angry as well. So did 
the captain. But Collingwood 



DARK INFERNO 



25 




tried to smile as he said, “You did 
very well, Mercer. But as an enter- 
tainer you should avoid overex- 
posure and you were in danger 
of—” 

“Fracturing your skull,” 
snapped Prescott. 

“I’m sorry about that,” said 
Mercer. “I missed hearing the 
thrust warning and got caught — ” 

“You missed hearing it,” said 
Prescott furiously, “because 
MacArdle was so interested in 
your performance that he forgot 
to send it. But even a medical of- 
ficer with a fractured skull would 
probably not be enough to put a 
Hold on this trip. I have never in 
my life seen a lousier, more slap- 
dash launch — ” 

“Leave it. Bob,” said the cap- 
tain tiredly. To Mercer he added: 
“Mr, Prescott, you may already 
have noticed, is an astronaut of 
the old school. His experience 
goes back to the time before space 
travel was officially declared safe. 
He is inclined sometimes to fuss.” 

“At least let Neilson and me 
eyeball the drive grids as we’re 
dumping the boosters — ” began 
Prescott. 

Collingwood’s hand twitched as 
if he had been about to point at the 
displays around them, and he said, 
“Bob, there’s no need.” He paused, 
looked at Neilson for a moment, 
added: “But to keep you happy 



we’ll have the station send up 
closeups of the withdrawal se- 
quence.” 

“The definition,” said Prescott, 
“will be too poor to resolve the 
fine details or show — oh, forget 
it.” He stared angrily at, or may- 
be through, Mercer who tried to 
pretend he was elsewhere. 

As he looked at his twin dis- 
plays— one showing his charges in 
the passenger module and the 
other the same picture they were 
seeing on their screen — he won- 
dered why Prescott had sent for 
him if not to give him a ticking off. 
Mercer’s instructor had told him 
that some medics were not al- 
lowed into the control room until 
several weeks of a voyage had 
elapsed. His presence here could 
have been a compliment, a pat on 
the back for being a good, hard- 
working boy — except for the fact 
that Prescott so obviously did 
not like him. 

Maybe that was why he was 
here. Prescott did not like any- 
body it seemed — and this could 
have been his way of showing it. 
He had told off MacArdle in such 
a way that the communications 
officer would be just as angry 
with Mercer as he was with Pres- 
cott. Everybody, even the cool 
and normally easy-going cap- 
tain, was angry with Prescott and 
they were only four hours out.

GALAXY 




Mercer was beginning to wonder 
if he should have stayed at home. 

But then his eyes went to the di- 
rect vision port and his doubts 
faded. The television pictures of 
this had only been a shadow of the 
reality and, one way or another, 
a man could pay an awful lot to 
see scenery like this. 

IV 

S TATION THREE had begun to 
kill its rotational velocity long 
before Eurydice had been 
launched. Now it hung motion- 
less like a gigantic, uncompleted 
wheel comprising six tubular 
spokes arranged in two di- 
ametrically opposed groups of 
three and two short tubular sec- 
tions of rim, which linked each 
group of spokes at the periphery. 
Unlike its smaller predecessors. 
One and Two, which were struc- 
turally complete and no longer 
capable of further growth. Three 
was still only a pup. 

It would take many years of time 
and effort — and Eurydice and her 
sister ships would have to pay it a 
large number of passing visits to 
donate their boosters — before its 
thirty spokes and far-flung rim 
would be completed. The boost- 
ers wrapped around the ships’ stern 
and waist sections and emptied of 
their fuel, formed the building 



blocks of the vast wheel. Upward 
of four thousand people would in- 
habit the station finally — to 
conduct the more exotic types of 
research that would ultimately 
put space, time and gravity to ef- 
fective use and make slow-burn- 
ers like Eurydice as obsolete as 
dugout canoes. One of its first — 
and perhaps easiest — ^jobs would 
be to impose a strict control on 
Earth’s weather. 

Later it might give men the stars, 
via either faster-than-light drive or 
the longevity to reach them. It 
would support and extend the 
work already being done on the 
bases of the Jovian moons. 

The work was the kind Mercer 
wanted to do among people who 
freely admitted to being insane 
for living how and where they did 
and who tried to put at least as 
much into their highly technical 
culture as they got out of it — a cul- 
ture that was neither as permis- 
sive as Earth’s of the past decades 
nor as viciously forbidding as 
the neo-puritan one that was be- 
ginning to replace it. 

Mercer was too cynical to be- 
lieve that the people of the Jovi- 
an colonies had built a utopia for 
themselves — they simply had 
been very thoroughly screened. 
There was no mesh in the screen, of 
course, but it was up to six hun- 
dred million miles thick and any- 



DARK INFERNO 



27 




one who made it through even once 
had to be someone quite special 
one way or another — of that 
Mercer had been very sure until 
the crew of Eurydice had started 
leaving clay footprints all over his 
nice, bright illusions. 

“Withdrawal sequence start- 
ing — now,” said the captain, 
arousing Mercer from his day- 
dream, “Neilson, stand by. Mac- 
Ardle, ask Three for a long ling- 
ering closeup of our tail and be 
careful how you phrase it.” He 
smiled, looked at Prescott and 
stopped smiling as he added: “As 
soon as we clear the boosters we 
will roll the ship. All of you take a 
long, hard look.” 

Prescott made no comment. He 
was staring at Neilson who did 
not look at all happy. 

Mercer divided his attention 
between the port and his screens 
while the men began playing an 
esoteric game involving the call- 
ing out of numbers and groups of 
initial letters while their fingers 
tapped illuminated buttons, their 
quiet voices and easy manner not 
quite concealing their deep con- 
centration on what they were do- 
ing. The station TV showed Eury- 
dice begin its inching withdrawal 
from the boosters. As the ship 
withdrew it began slowly to ro- 
tate. 

On the passengers’ screen the 



station was already slipping off 
the edge so that they would have 
nothing to look at until it came 
on-screen an unguessable num- 
ber of minutes later. He had no 
idea of how long the visual in- 
spection would take and the crew 
was too busy for him to ask, so he 
switched the passenger screen to 
the station signal so that his 
charges would have something in- 
teresting to look at. Then he 
froze, looking guiltily at Prescott 
as he wondered whether he was 
supposed to do things like that 
without first asking permission. 

But Prescott merely nodded and 
continued with what he had been 
doing and saying. 

Almost imperceptibly Eurydice 
withdrew from her boosters, like 
a bolt being slowly unscrewed 
from an enormous truncated nut. 
First the bulge of the passenger 
section twisted out, then the long 
cylinder directly behind it, 
which housed the free-fall lounge 
and the water tank containing 
the reaction mass for the nuclear 
engine, and finally the long, ta- 
pering cowling of the reactor it- 
self. As it drew clear, panels 
opened and retractable sensors 
and focusing coils unfolded 
themselves, breaking up the clean 
outline. 

The wall speaker cleared its 
throat and a voice from Three said. 



28 



GALAXY 




“I’ve got a telescope on you — it 
gives much better definition than 
the TV camera. But what exactly 
am I looking for, fellows?’’ 

The captain glanced at the first 
officer without making any at- 
tempt to reply. 

“Prescott. Nothing in particu- 
lar, friend. It’s just that I’m the 
worrying type.’’ 

Mercer expected a sarcastic re- 
tort, but instead a long silence en- 
sued, broken when the voice said, 
“You look good from here. Bob. 
I’ll slip a filter onto this thing and 
watch while you light your torch. 
But if you’re going to do some- 
thing melodramatic with your re- 
actor, don’t do it too close to the 
station, huh?” 

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said 
Prescott. 

On the station picture Eurydice 
drifted away from the boosters, 
spurting bright balloons of fog as 
she lined up for the Jovian orbit 
insertion. The crew was complet- 
ing the attitude checks and the 
captain was telling the passen- 
gers to expect thrust in ten min- 
utes. Mercer concentrated on his 
own small, overly simple control 
panel, angling the remote-con- 
trolled TV camera on the outer 
hull to give what he hoped would be 
a picture of the space station fall- 
ing away when they began their 
burn. The closeup of the tail be- 



ing transmitted by Three at that 
time might be a little disconcert- 
ing to the uninitiated. 

Such as myself, Mercer thought. 

K FEW seconds before Neilson 
^ pulled out his dampers Mercer 
switched pictures. Then the couch 
was pushing him gently in the 
back and Three began to shrink 
away from the edges of the screen. 
The enormous structure dimin- 
ished steadily until it became a 
tiny, dazzlingly white insect en- 
closed by the sunset terminator. 

“Very artistic,” said Prescott. 
“You’ll spoil them if you aren’t 
careful, Mercer.” 

“A large part of my job,” said 
Mercer stiffly, “is keeping the 
passengers happy. I was told 
that — ” 

“And a small part of my job,” 
Prescott broke in, “is seeing that 
you do yours correctly. Now, 
what will be the next item offered 
for their delight? More acrobat- 
ics?” 

Mercer shook his head. “Rig- 
ging the cabin walls at this stage 
would interfere with passenger 
visibility during the survival 
film. And that should wait until 
after they have eaten and they be- 
gin to realize that they are really 
in space. So first I introduce them 
to weightless eating and see that 



DARK INFERNO 



29 




they don’t make too big a mess do- 
ing it.” 

“No,” said Prescott sharply. 
“First you switch off the hull TV 
camera. Station Three will short- 
ly be out of sight and a continu- 
ous picture of a receding Earth 
might make someone homesick. 
Then you will announce lunch and 
then let them get on with it. Ship’s 
officers are supposed to remain 
aloof from the passengers, Mer- 
cer, and running after them too 
much gives the impression that 
you are little more than a stew- 
ard. You are, but they must not be 
allowed to know that. When we 
cut thrust in two hours from 
now — for a few minutes only to 
test the damper controls — the 
mess they will have made will be so 
obvious that with luck they will 
feel too ashamed of themselves to 
risk the same kind of mess again. 
Only then will you go down 
there — for the first and only 
time — and clean up. But it would 
be much better for your image if 
you chivied one or more passen- 
gers into doing it.” 

“That was how the last medic 
got himself fixed for the rest of the 
trip,” said MacArdle, laughing. 
“But one housemaid wasn’t 
enough for him and he began — ” 

“Mercer,” said Prescott, “what 
are you waiting for?” 

Seething behind what he hoped 



was a poker face, Mercer killed 
the picture of the beautiful cres- 
cent Earth and spoke to the pas- 
sengers as he had been directed. 
He had known people like Pres- 
cott most of his life — teachers and 
professors and surgeons who had 
stomach ulcers or bad domestic 
trouble or who had simply in- 
herited a nasty disposition. 
There were only two ways to react 
to them — either ignore them and 
their continual jabbing until they 
themselves got tired of doing it or 
display a controlled reaction de- 
signed to show them that they 
were not dealing with a sponge 
that soaked up everything with- 
out protest. 

“Four hours should be enough to 
let them eat and get to know each 
other,” Prescott continued, “and 
not enough to allow arguments to 
start. You will spend those four 
hours in your cabin, resting, af- 
ter which you will see to the tidy- 
ing up and contrive to introduce 
the subject of safety and survival 
in space. Y ou will try to do so with- 
out scaring half the passengers to 
death.” 

“Just because I’ve spent most of 
my life studying for examina- 
tions,” said Mercer quietly, 
“doesn’t mean I’m stupid.” 

“There is a difference,” said 
Prescott just as quietly, “be- 
tween education and iiilelligeMce.” 



30 



GALAXY 




“But I’m not tired,” said Mer- 
cer, knowing that he was losing 
on this exchange but not wanting 
to admit it. 

Prescott sighed. “If you don’t go 
to your cabin,” he said, “we won’t 
be able to talk about you behind 
your back.” 

As he climbed down to his cab- 
in, very carefully despite the 
half-G thrust, Mercer was not 
really surprised to hear Prescott 
talking to Neilson with ‘occa- 
sional interjections from the 
captain, or that the subject of the 
conversation was far removed 
from the ship’s medical officer. 
He opened and closed the seals in- 
to his cabin, cutting off the sound 
of voices and feeling like a child 
dismissed from a room where the 
conversation was too adult. 

U NLIKE the other officers’ cab- 
ins, which were fitted with more 
sophisticated equipment, occu- 
pying much less space, Mercer’s 
did not give much room for him to 
move. From the entry lock the 
floor grill stretched ten feet to the 
curved plastic canopy that ran 
from below his feet to what was 
nominally the ceiling and gave, 
in the ship’s present mode, a hun- 
dred-and-eighty-degree view of the 
inside of the outer hull, complete 
with structural members and 
brightly colored cable runs. The 



floor grill, which was just under 
three feet wide, separated two 
vertical tiers of bunks, eight on 
one side and five on the other. This 
was because the lowest one of the 
five was Mercer’s and he, being 
the doctor, needed much more 
than the twelve inches that divided 
the patients’ bunks. 

A passenger unfortunate enough 
to come down with an infectious 
disease could be isolated from the 
living quarters and other patients. 
The bunks were fitted with their 
individual air supply and a hinged 
flap that sealed in the patient. 
Mercer did not suffer from claus- 
trophobia, but he thought that any 
patient needing to spend more 
than a few days in one of those 
bunks would have to be kept un- 
der heavy sedation or he would 
blow his organic computer. 

His own bunk did not have all 
that much elbow room, of course, 
surrounded and overhung as it 
was by communication and con- 
trol panels and cupboards con- 
taining medication. There was 
much more than he could ever ex- 
pect to use, even if a dozen epi- 
demics swept the ship. Neverthe- 
less, Prescott did a quick check of 
the medical supplies, then 
strapped himself into his couch. 

But not, he was sure, to sleep. 

The buzzer had a low, insistent 
note that gradually increased in 



DARK INFERNO 



31 




pitch until he signaled that he was 
fully awake by switching it off. It 
was replaced by the sound of the 
captain’s voice, which could not be 
switched off, ever. 

“Mercer, you have been sleep- 
ing peacefully, if rather noisily, 
for the past five and a half hours. 
During that time your passen- 
gers had their first meal and did 
quite a lot of socializing, so there 
was no need to wake you. But now 
the natives are growing restive. 
As soon as you’ve eaten go back 
and see that the place is tidy, then 
set up for the survival lecture and 
film. We shall go into cruising 
mode in just under four hours, so 
you have plenty of time.’’ 

“Yes, sir,’’ said Mercer. 

“We are required by law,” the 
captain went on, “to conduct 
three survival drills as soon as 
possible after takeoff, even 
though nothing has ever gone 
wrong or, considering the cur- 
rent fail-safe structural philos- 
ophies and the multiplicity of 
backup systems, is ever likely to. 
But you know all this. You also 
know that, to keep the passengers 
from feeling nervous, the first 
drill is treated as something of a 
joke — an amusing film followed 
by a light-hearted question-and- 
answer session. Don’t fright- 
en them, Mercer. But don’t be too 
much of a comedian either.” 



For a few seconds the captain 
had sounded exactly like Pres- 
cott, Mercer thought. He was be- 
ginning to understand why the 
medic before him had tried to 
make so many friends among the 
passengers. Or was it his prede- 
cessor’s behavior with the pas- 
sengers that was the reason for 
Prescott’s and the others’ treat- 
ing him as they were doing? It was 
very hard to know which end of the 
stick was being used to beat him. 

He was still pondering the ques- 
tion when he returned to the pas- 
senger module. The deck was not 
nearly as untidy as he had ex- 
pected, nor had the litter been 
widely scattered by the brief ces- 
sation of thrust. Mercer nodded 
politely to anyone who waved, 
smiled or otherwise noticed him 
as he headed for his couch. He had 
already decided on the people 
who would volunteer for the 
cleanup squad. 

“Your attention, ladies and gen- 
tlemen,” he said, using the mod- 
ule’s PA. “By now you should have 
finished your first meal in 
space — no doubt with a few acci- 
dental spillages here and there — 
and begun getting to know each 
other. You will have plenty of 
time — four months, in fact — to 
finish getting to know each other, 
but cleaning up the litter is much 
more urgent. That is why I would 



32 



GALAXY 




like three of you to help me by — ” 
They were suddenly like a class- 
room full of eager pupils with the 
answer to teacher’s question. 

Mercer shook his head. “I knew 
you would all like to help, but to 
avoid offending anyone I shall 
pick the three people closest to 
me, if they have no objections.” 
They hadn’t. Mrs. Mathewson 
smiled and nodded. Stone nodded 
without smiling and Bobby 
Mathewson was trying des- 
perately to salute with his arm tan- 
gled in webbing, his eyes almost as 
wide open as his mouth with ex- 
citement. Mercer concentrated 
on the boy. 

“We do not salute on this ship,” 
he said gravely, “nor do you call 
anyone ‘sir’ except the captain. 
Saluting spacemen happens only 
on television — so you are Mathew- 
son and I am Mercer.” 

Treat a boy like a young man, 
his instructor had told him, and 
you won't go far wrong . 

Explaining the operation of the 
cleaners over and over again until 
he understood it completely was 
something he could do to the boy 
but not to the two adults. Repeat- 
ing instructions to them might 
make them think that he consid- 
ered them stupid. But this way they 
would all be sure to get it right 
without his running the risk of 
their taking offence. Finally he 



turned the three of them loose, 
watched them at work for a few 
minutes, then returned to his 
couch to call MacArdle to have the 
survival film ready to run. 

Prescott and Neilson climbed in- 
to sight a few minutes later and 
stood looking around the passen- 
ger deck. Mercer went across to 
them in case they had instructions. 

Prescott stared at him without 
speaking. Neilson did not look 
at him, but said, “I don’t under- 
stand you. Look at that blonde on 
couch eighteen and the Asian on 
twenty-three and you gave away 
the job to a man, a widow 
and — and her ten-year-old boy. 
You’re missing chances, Mercer.” 

He spoke softly so as not to be 
overheard by nearby passengers 
and without moving his lips, just 
like a convict in an old-time prison 
film. Mercer tried to copy the ex- 
pression and intonation as he re- 
plied,, “Maybe I prefer ten-year-old 
boys.” 

Prescott laughed. It was a harsh, 
unrelaxed sound, probably be- 
cause it was produced by a 
mechanism stiff from disuse. The 
two men left Mercer and continued 
their climb toward control. 

V 

T he film was beautifully made, 
technically excellent and with a 



DARK INFERNO 



33 




nice balance of animation and 
real footage — but it lacked accur- 
acy. Not that it made any deliber- 
ate misstatements, it was just that 
watching the antics of a cartoon 
character did not give a true pic- 
ture of a real person’s physical 
and mental capabilities. 

A smiling young pseudo-space- 
man who had cut his gleaming 
teeth on a great many TV com- 
mercials began by introducing 
everyone to the ship, talking 
brightly over performance and 
payload charts, design philosophy 
and an animated staging sequence. 
Then he began taking the ship 
apart, literally, into neat, color- 
coded sections, magnifying each 
section and detailing its func- 
tion — control, officers’ quarters, 
passenger lounge and cabins, 
weightless lounge, reaction mass 
tank and the eye-twisting detail of 
the reactor itself. Mercer’s sick 
bay/cabin looked ridiculously 
large for one man and thirteen pa- 
tients while the quarters of the 
passengers were unbelievably 
spacious. 

Mercer did not believe and neith- 
er, after a few days, would the pas- 
sengers. 

“. and now,” continued the 
smiling spaceman, hesitating as if 
to apologize for wasting the 
audience’s time on nonessen- 
tials,“we come to the subject of 



survival should an emergency 
arise. No such emergency has 
arisen in the past nor, consider- 
ing the rigorous checks and in- 
spections carried out before 
every flight, is one ever likely to 
occur in the future. But we are 
obliged by the regulations to ex- 
plain our survival equipment and 
to give you the chance to practice 
with it — ” 

Mercer had already seen the film 
many times and had listened to 
much more detailed lectures on 
the subject. His train of thought 
branched off onto a different but 
nearly parallel track. 

In his line of work human life 
had always been considered of 
paramount importance — in theory 
at least, a life was valued beyond 
price. But the cost of protecting 
the lives of officers and passengers 
in a spaceship, where every kilo 
hauled out of Earth’s gravity rep- 
resented enough coin of the realm 
— anybody’s realm — to make ev- 
ery person on the ship comfortably 
rich from the cradle to the urn, 
was astronomical. Naturally the 
price of the passengers’ tickets did 
not defray even a small fraction of 
the transport bill, much less the 
extra-weight penalties represented 
by backup systems and survival 
equipment. Those items were con- 
veniently lost in the even more 
complex systems of government 



34 



GALAXY 




bookkeeping under headings like 
national prestige, technological 
spin-off and assisting the maxi- 
mum utilization of technically 
trained manpower. 

Human life seemed to grow 
more and more valuable the farth- 
er it was removed from Earth. In 
space its value was incalculable; in 
the five-hundred- and thousand- 
seat transports flying between 
five and ten miles above the sur- 
face it was merely high and on sur- 
face transport systems the powers 
that were did not seem to worry too 
much about lives. But no fare-pay- 
ing passenger had ever been lost 
in space, while a few hundred a 
year on average were cremated in 
metal birds which prematurely 
stopped flying and on the surface 
people mowed each other down 
with cars in thousands daily. 

Mercer had spent two years with 
an organization that “processed” 
road accidents. That was how it 
referred to its function — too few 
of the victims survived for it to 
call itself a hospital that cured 
people. He had grown up in — and 
was now, he realized, trying to 
flee — a technologically ad- 
vanced, ultra-fast and strangely 
bored society whose casualties 
had had the depersonalized, sex- 
less sameness of so many mashed 
flies. The drunken or drug-ridden 
or simply bored drivers and the 



careless or absent-minded or inno- 
cent bystanders victimized, when 
they were separated from the ma- 
chinery or the machinery was re- 
moved from them, could rarely be 
made presentable by even the most 
conscientious of morticians. 

Mercer’s thoughts were taking a 
morbid turn. He had long ago dis- 
covered that no simple answers 
existed to complex problems. The 
best thing he could do right now 
was to give all his attention to the 
survival film, while trying not to 
look openly scornful of the sim- 
ple answers it was giving to what 
would be, if it ever occurred, an 
extremely complex and lethal 
problem. 

The spaceman with the teeth, the 
cap worn on the back of his head 
and practically all of his uniform 
zips undone was saying “ ... in 
the unlikely event of such an emer- 
gency the passengers and crew 
will probably have several hours 
or even days to abandon ship — a 
process which can, if necessary, 
be carried out safely and without 
undue fuss in a few minutes. The 
next stage deals with the mechanics 
of the abandon-ship sequence, 
showing the basic actions first 
and then repeating them with cer- 
tain variations — ” 

O N THE screen the distressed 
ship developed a faint red halo 



DARK INFERNO 



35 




around its reactor. The halo be- 
gan to brighten and pulsate, but 
not quickly enough really to 
frighten anyone. Farther for- 
ward the passenger section con- 
tinued to spin slowly as it 
furnished artificial gravity, while 
the rest of the ship held steady. 
Gradually it slowed as braking 
devices went into operation, 
making the ship a rigid unit again 
in the pre-cruising mode. The 
spinning passenger section had 
imparted its rotational inertia to 
the ship as a whole, causing it to 
spin at half its original speed. 

Suddenly the ship emitted long 
white cylinders that flung them- 
selves away from the spinning ves- 
sel and expanded into large 
globes as they went. Shortly after- 
ward four larger, wedge-shaped 
sections of the forward struc- 
ture — the modules containing 
each officer’s cabin — broke away 
and followed the expanding cir- 
cle of passenger globes. The re- 
mains of the ship — looking 
warped and lifeless, although not 
frighteningly so — shrank as the 
wedges and globes radiated from 
the wreck and the screen took in a 
steadily expanding area of space. 
Finally the ship disappeared and 
the survival pods applied thrust 
for a few seconds and began their 
slow return to the recovery area 
until they were grouped like 



spherical sheep around the offi- 
cers’ segments, which had also re- 
turned and were waiting for them. 

On the second time around the 
sequence went into greater detail 
regarding the method of entry 
into the survival pod, its airlock, 
radio, two-shot thrust motor and 
other rather sparse appoint- 
ments. The final treatment of the 
sequence, which was too delight- 
fully droll to cause anxiety to any- 
one, dealt with methods of atti- 
tude control in a vehicle fitted 
with only one short-duration and 
fixed-direction thruster. 

“. Most of you are probably 
thinking by now that our sur- 
vivors are being given an awful lot 
to do,” said the space officer star 
as his face replaced the irnage of 
the survival pods, “or that the 
globes should contain more 
sophisticated equipment, such as 
proper attitude control, naviga- 
tion computers and the like. But 
you must remember that your 
survival globe is little more than a 
lifebelt and that a lifebelt cannot 
be overloaded or it will sink. Be- 
lieve me, the equipment is ade- 
quate. 

“It is adequate,” he continued 
in a proud, solemn voice while he 
tapped his temple very slowly with 
his right index finger, “because 
each will be carrying at least one 
organic computer of a type that 



36 



GALAXY 




has been tried and perfected over a 
million years.” 

In control MacArdle brought up 
the lights and expertly faded out 
the background music. Mercer 
stood up, swaying slightly in the 
low gravity, and looked over his 
charges. 

Before he could speak the pas- 
senger called Stone tapped the 
side of his head and said solemnly, 
“He makes me feel proud — and 
kinda sick.” 

Me, too. thought Mercer. 

Aloud he asked, “Any ques- 
tions?” 

“What I would like to know,” 
said a passenger with Miss 
Moore stamped on her identity 
patch, “is why we don’t have of- 
ficers like that on this ship? Why 
don’t you relax a little, sir? Can’t 
you smile the way he did?” 

“He probably can’t” said Mrs. 
Mathewson, laughing, “because 
his teeth are real and a bit un- 
even.” 

“His eyes look a bit uneven, 
too,” Miss Moore said, “but they 
are a nice shade of — ” 

“An optical illusion, ma’am,” 
said Mercer hastily, “caused by 
one slightly thicker eyebrow. But 
I was inviting questions on sur- 
vival in space.” 

“And I was asking one,” she re- 
plied, looking him straight in the 
eye. “I was wondering if you had 



any suggestions on how I can sur- 
vive the boredom of living for 
four months in a hermetically 
sealed can of space-going sar- 
dines. Perhaps some of the sar- 
dines will cooperate in relieving 
the boredom?” 

Mercer nodded and said serious- 
ly, “Provision has been made for 
various forms of individual and 
group competitions and enter- 
tainment. Nothing too strenuous, 
of course, although it is advis- 
able to take a certain amount of 
exercise every day to avoid bal- 
ance and blood pressure problems 
after we land. We have music 
tapes and films, most of which are 
fairly recent — by that I mean that 
they have not yet been released for 
television. There will also be in- 
struction in weightless swimming 
and ballet, which brings me back to 
the survival drills. Even though 
their usefulness is arguable, the 
three sessions we are obliged by 
regulations to stage can be very 
interesting and often amusing.” 

The silence began to drag until 
Stone said, “What we really want 
to know is what our beautifully 
designed individual flight plans 
say between the lines. There isn’t 
much space between the lines, of 
course, but if all the rumors we’ve 
heard are true it is very well filled. 
How about filling in a few of them 
for us?” 



DARK INFERNO 



37 




P RACTICALLY all the passen- 
gers were watching Mercer and 
listening — or not watching him 
and listening even harder. He 
nodded gravely and said, “There is 
very little to add. The rules are few 
and not at all strict, so that you 
should be bound only by the dic- 
tates of common sense and con- 
sideration for each other. You will 
be living in a restricted space, 
sharing toilet and amusement 
facilities and using cabins provid- 
ing visual privacy only. It is a good 
idea to put a little effort into lik- 
ing instead of disliking tlie peo- 
ple around you.” 

“Love your neighbor?” asked 
someone. 

“Apart from this largely self-im- 
posed discipline,” Mercer went on, 
“there are no rules as far as the 
passengers are concerned and 
you will be left pretty much to your 
own devices. But if some form of 
individual or group activity 
proves harmful to the ship or oth- 
er passengers the person responsi- 
ble will be warned and if necessary 
restrained in sick bay — ” 

“A fate worse than death, I 
hope,” said Miss Moore. 

Mercer nodded. “If you call 
spending four months in a bunk 
the size and shape of a coffin un- 
der partial sedation a fate worse 
than death I’m inclined to agree 
with you,” he said, allowing his 



irritation with Miss Moore to 
show for a moment. Mercer knew 
that he was not supposed to talk as 
bluntly as this to passengers on 
the first day out and Prescott 
would probably skin him alive for 
it. He forced himself to relax and 
continued, “But that kind of 
trouble is unlikely to arise in a 
healthy, civilized group of people 
like yourselves. This isn’t flattery. 
You all know how thorough were 
the medical and psych checks you 
had to take before being allowed 
to book passage.” 

The trouble was, Mercer 
thought, that in this degenerate 
age the mental norms had been 
stretched to fit some strange psych 
profiles. About all he really could 
be sure of was that none of the pas- 
sengers were or had recently been 
on hard drugs. 

He continued, “With the excep- 
tion of myself, the ship’s officers 
have their own specialist duties to 
perform and will intervene only if 
somebody starts a riot or tries to 
kick a hole in the hull. A part of my 
job is to see that you all adapt to 
shipboard life as quickly and 
easily as possible, to keep a check 
on your health and to instruct you 
in the use of such items as the 
swimming facilities and, of 
course, the survival equipment. I 
shall not intrude on your social 
activities even if invited to do so 



38 



GALAXY 




and you are all free to do pretty 
much as you please. Have you any 
questions?” 

Inevitably the Moore woman 
had a question, the same question 
with a slightly different slant. 

“How will the officers be able to 
survive the trip,” she said, “with 
nothing to amuse them but com- 
puters and textbooks? I realize 
that you are all highly trained and 
disciplined supermen — but four 
months of self-imposed celibacy in 
a space-going monastery cell? I 
mean, is it necessary?” 

Mercer was silent, thinking that 
the simple answer was that it was 
not necessary and that his 
predecessor’s behavior was be- 
coming much more understand- 
able to him. In Eurydice tempta- 
tion was anything but subtle if this 
was the kind of question that 
could come up during the first 
day’s flight. He wondered what 
Miss Moore did in real life and he 
was still wondering and trying to 
think of a diplomatic reply when 
Mrs. Mathewson rescued him. 

“Maybe our supermen are in- 
terested only in superwomen,” 
she said. 

VI 

T he transition from powered 
to free flight occurred half an 
hour later. The anti-nausea 



medication he had administered 
just before takeoff was still doing 
its job so that the upsets were 
psychological and intra-personal 
rather than digestive. They came 
about as a direct result of the 
transfer of passenger couches 
from the deck to what had been the 
walls of the compartment. 

Mercer had demonstrated the 
safe, easy way of performing the 
operations — by lying face down, 
held in position by the waist straps 
only and allowing the arms and 
legs to project over the edges of 
the couch to propel it along, check 
its progress or fend off other 
couch riders on collision courses. 
But in the weightless condition the 
couches were too easy to move and, 
although they did not weigh any- 
thing, their inertia was consider- 
able. Set moving in the wrong 
direction or pushed too hard they 
could give a nearby passenger a 
very painful nudge. 

While they were being moved in- 
to their new position Mercer also 
had to exercise a great deal of 
discretion regarding who would 
be occupying adjoining cabins — 
especially when four or five pas- 
sengers insisted on adjoining a 
sixth, who did not wish to adjoin 
with them. Finally he had to check 
that the passengers had not posi- 
tioned their couches across the line 
of a dividing wall, or over a light 



DARK INFERNO 



39 




fixture or on top of a life-pod es- 
cape hatch. 

At that stage he signaled con- 
trol to begin spinning the passen- 
ger compartment and gradually 
the occupants began to stick with 
increasing firmness to their new 
floors. The spin increased until 
centrifugal force pressed them 
against the interior of the hull with 
an apparent gravity one half that of 
Earth normal. Forward and aft of 
the passenger sections the com- 
partments which were supposed 
to remain weightless had begun 
to rotate in the opposite direction 
and Mercer could hear the regular 
thump of tangential thrusters 
checking the precession. But none 
of the passengers seemed wor- 
ried by the noise — they were too 
busy laughing and waving at fel- 
low passengers who were appar- 
ently standing on the ceiling, 
waving back at them. 

Mercer waited for a few min- 
utes to allow them to get used to 
the sensation. Finally he made his 
way to the section of plating 
occupied by the Mathewsons and 
asked if he could borrow Bobby. 
With the boy’s help he began dis- 
tributing the plastic cabin 
dividers, demonstrating the 
method of attaching them to the 
supporting lines so that they 
formed four taut, plastic walls and 
a pull-across door sheet that could 



be sealed from the inside. By the 
time he had finished explaining 
how it was done to the last passen- 
ger the first cabins were complete 
and he was able to return Bobby to 
his mother. 

“He’s been a big help, m’am,’’ 
he told Mrs. Mathewson and he 
was not merely being polite, “but 
the work has overexcited him a 
little. I’m afraid. I suggest you 
give him the adult dose of seda- 
tive.’’ 

He kneeled briefly beside her 
couch, pressed the release stud on 
a plate set flush with the floor. He 
flipped it back, explaining that 
the cover was simply for protec- 
tion during the couch-moving 
operation and that the recess con- 
tained a call button, microphone 
and speaker to enable her to con- 
tact him in control or the sick bay 
if the need should arise. 

“But right now I suggest that 
you take a half-hour getting used 
to the place and preparing to turn 
in,” he said. “The cabin walls are 
opaque but translucent and we 
shall be switching off the main 
lighting in an hour. If you want to 
read the directional light on your 
couch will not inconvenience any- 
one who may be trying to sleep.” 

“As for you,” he said to the boy, 
“you can stand down. Don’t forget 
to take your medication. I shall 
probably need you again tomor- 



40 



GALAXY 




row and I don’t want you half 
asleep on your feet. Good night, 
Mathewson.” 

“Good night, Mercer,” said the 
boy. His mother smiled and 
nodded. 

In the next cabin he went 
through the same drill and in the 
next. Some of the faces registered 
on him, but others did not be- 
cause he kept thinking about Mrs. 
Mathewson and the difference a 
half-G had made to her face, eas- 
ing the tension lines and rounding 
out her features and figure. She 
had last looked incredibly young 
to have a son of ten years. He won- 
dered suddenly if she had escaped 
from more than just the gravity of 
Earth. 

His final job before leaving for 
control was to stick name and 
number patches to the cabin door 
sheets and draw up a list of who 
was where. 

T he control room was quiet and 
the expressions on the faces of 
its occupants made it plain that 
they wanted it to stay that way. 
Mercer nodded to Neilson and the 
captain — the only two who both- 
ered to look at him — and floated 
into his couch. He clipped his list 
to the back of his left forearm and 
began printing the passengers’ 
names on self-adhesive cards that 
he placed beside the numbered 



lights on his call board. By the time 
he had finished, the vision pickup 
showed the passenger compart- 
ment in darkness and his fellow 
officers were showing signs of 
breaking their vows of silence. 

Beside each numbered call light 
was a switch that energized the 
cabin microphones without, of 
course, acquainting the occu- 
pant’s with the fact. He brought in 
the Mathewson cabin first, lis- 
tened briefly to heavy, adult 
breathing too irregular for its 
owner to be asleep and a childish 
whisper saying “. and God 
bless Mum and Dad and make him 
the same every day . .” 

Quickly he flipped off the switch, 
realizing that Bobby had revealed 
a great deal about the Mathew- 
sons in a very few seconds. At 
least on the ship they would not be 
troubled by a man who was a dif- 
ferent person practically every 
day of the week. 

The other switches brought in 
the sound of peaceful breathing 
and one the silence of an empty 
cabin. He checked the pickups in 
the heads, which were also empty 
and, with visions of a passenger 
lost in the dark and blundering 
through fragile cabin walls and 
wakening everyone, he began 
thumbing the switches sys- 
tematically, searching for an 
incipient disturbance. 



DARK INFERNO 



41 




He did not find it. Instead he 
brought in a whispered conversa- 
tion from a supposedly single 
cabin, which he switched off hur- 
riedly as it was reaching an inter- 
esting stage. 

“Spoilsport,” said MacArdle. 

“Sorry,” said Mercer. He 
laughed, ridiculously pleased that 
someone had at last decided to 
speak to him. 

“There is no necessity for you to 
remain on duty, Mercer,” said the 
captain. “Your handling of the 
passengers has been very good 
and your own behaviour excel- 
lent, so far. Why don’t you get 
some extra sleep in your cabin 
while you have the chance — you 
have a dupicate board there and 
the call buzzer is loud enough to 
wake you should a passenger need 
attention.” 

They don't want me around, 
thought Mercer angrily. Unlike 
Prescott, the captain was being 
polite — even complimentary — in 
his dismissal, but it was plain that 
Mercer was not one of the team 
and that they did not want him 
hanging around. But all at once 
Mercer did not want to be sent to 
bed like a small boy. He was going 
to be hanging around for the next 
four months at least and the soon- 
er they got used to the idea the bet- 
ter. Besides, the captain had not 
actually ordered him below. 



He smiled and said, “Thank you, 
sir. It has been rather hectic down 
there, but there are times when I 
find my own company a strain as 
well. So if you don’t mind, sir, I 
would like to stay for a while and 
enjoy the atmosphere of sanity 
and peace.” 

They did not even look at him 
and the silence lengthened until 
finally Neilson said drily, “It isn’t 
peace, Mercer — it’s more like a 
temporary cease-fire.” 

Prescott stirred on his couch, but 
it was the captain who spoke. He 
sounded polite and friendly and a 
little absentminded, as if an argu- 
mentative medic were only one of 
his problems. 

“It is possible that you will grow 
exceedingly tired of the control 
room and the people who inhabit 
it in the months to come, Mercer,” 
he said. “But you are welcome to 
stay here, of course, even if there is 
nothing for you to do. Unless you 
would like to spend some of the 
time telling me what you have 
planned for tomorrow? At one 
stage, after the cabin construc- 
tion, period, you were apparently 
organizing card games. Why?” 

“Yes, sir,” said Mercer. “Two of 
the passengers seemed to be wor- 
ried by the survival film and I 
changed the subject by telling 
them that weightless swimming 
was available to everyone once 



42 



GALAXY 




the ship was in cruising mode. I 
mentioned cards as being a fair 
way of deciding who would be the 
first two people into the pool with 
me. I’m afraid two at a time is as 
many as I can handle until I’ve 
had a little more experience my- 
self.” 

“And the survival drills?” 

“In the circumstances I thought 
of delaying them for a few days,” 
said Mercer. “Passenger nervous- 
ness can be catching and my in- 
structor told me that quite a lot of 
latitude is allowed in the timing 
of these drills. Also that the par- 
tial dismantling of cabin walls can 
be irksome if the passengers are 
not already a little bored and will- 
ing to play a new, if somewhat in- 
convenient, game. Of course, I 
could take small groups of less 
nervous passengers and give them 
survival instruction until most of 
them were proficient. That way the 
first full-scale drill would not be the 
shambles that the book says it 
usually is.” 

He stopped because the captain 
was shaking his head. 

“I’m sorry, Mercer,” he said 
firmly, “but I don’t agree with 
that part of the book. I think that I 
can trust you to carry out the exer- 
cise without creating too much 
alarm among the passengers. The 
regulations state that survival in- 
struction be given to all passen- 



gers as soon as possible after take- 
off — and as far as I am concerned 
‘as soon as possible’ means just 
that.” 

Mercer nodded. Obviously Col- 
lingwood’s concept of the space- 
going priorities differed from 
those of the ground-bound, PR- 
minded type who had produced 
the copy for Mercer’s manual. 

“Later in the voyage,” the cap- 
tain added, “you may stage as 
many therapeutic survival drills as 
you think fit, but the passengers 
must be made aware of the sur- 
vival procedures at the begin- 
ning, not close to the end of the 
trip—” 

^^PURYDICE ground control. 

^Do you read?” The voice 
came frome the speaker. 

The captain glanced at the grill 
above his head and said, "'Eury- 
dice. Go ahead.” 

“Your signal of fourteen seven- 
ty-six this day querying pulsing and 
apparent temporary misalign- 
ment of your C-Sixes during ini- 
tial insertion. We have looked at 
this and can see no cause for con- 
cern, especially as your instru- 
mentation gives no indication of 
malfunction. We don’t see that 
you have a problem, Eurydice." 

“We don’t have a problem,” re- 
plied the captain with just a hint of 
irritation in his tone. “But we 



DARK INFERNO 



43 




would like an explanation for that 
few minutes of uneven thrust and 
we think the answer lies in area C. 
We will be using the nuclear 
propulsion system for standby 
heating only so we are not — re- 
peat not — worried, but — ” 

“Prescott would like an explana- 
tion, I understand.” 

Reception was too good for 
there to be any mistaking the tone, 
which made it all too plain that 
ground control knew Prescott of 
old and considered him to be 
something of a fusspot. The cap- 
tain, Neilson and MacArdle were 
carefully not looking at the first 
officer while they tried to hide 
their embarrassment. Prescott 
himself did not appear to be em- 
barrassed or even uncomfortable 
and Mercer wondered if he was so 
sure that his point of view was 
right that it did not matter what 
his fellow officers thought of him. 

“You already know, of course, 
that your C-Sixes are sealed units 
and were thoroughly tested before 
assembly. If one of yours is sick 
the only way we can check on it is 
by turning up the maker’s work- 
sheets and inspection paper- 
work. We will get on to that at 
once and come back to you. Is 
there anything else not bothering 
you, gentlemen?” 

“Nothing else,” said the cap- 
tain. ''Eurydice out.” 



The silence lengthened, magnify- 
ing the tiny sounds made by the 
life-support and power systems, 
until Prescott cleared his throat. 
When he spoke his voice sounded 
firm and reasonable — perhaps, 
thought Mercer, this was the near- 
est that the first officer could come 
to apologizing. 

He said, “Friend Neilson did not 
do a complete check of area C for 
the reasons he has already 
given — acceptable reasons, to 
most first officers. And even if he 
had carried out the full inspec- 
tion program there is still no cer- 
tainty that the fault — if there is a 
fault — would have shown up. The 
chances are that it would not show 
now even if it were there. But I 
would still like to have a look — ” 

“You will stay here. Bob,” said 
the captain sharply, “while Neil- 
son and I have a look. We’ll suit up 
and go through the passenger sec- 
tion and tank an hour before the 
passengers are due to wake to 
avoid worrying them with the 
sight of two officers in spacesuits. 
Once I discover the explanation 
for our initial bumpy ride we shall 
not discuss it — or even mention 
it — for the rest of the trip.” 

This time even Prescott was 
showing signs of embarrassment 
and Mercer was suddenly sorry 
for him. As a doctor he disliked 
seeing anyone suffer. 



44 



GALAXY 




“And Mercer,” the captain went 
on, “if I tell you too often, or with 
too much emphasis, not to worry 
about the things you have just 
heard, you will probably worry 
even harder. Let me just say that 
the problems you will have to face 
with your passengers will be very 
much worse than anything that is 
likely to crop up here. MacArdle, 
keep an eye and an ear on his 
panel. You’re relieved, Mercer. 
Good night.” 

As he was returning to his cabin 
Mercer felt sorry that he had not 
left sooner. He had thought that 
they had been trying to exclude 
him because he was an outsider, a 
nonmember of their very ex- 
clusive club, while the truth was 
that they had an aversion toward 
the presence of a stranger at a fam- 
ily fight. 

VII 

M ercer was stni in his couch 
and squeezing food out of an 
envelope when he heard the outer 
hatch open. Next came a polite 
knock on the inner seal. A few sec- 
onds later it opened and Prescott 
floated in. 

“Finish your breakfast and don’t 
get up,” he said. “I take it that you 
will hold the first survival drill as 
soon as the passengers have eaten 
and tidied up?” 



Mercer nodded. 

“Good. But I would like to make 
a suggestion — or, if the polite 
phraseology gives you the idea 
that you have some choice in the 
matter, consider it an order. 
Demonstrating how to climb in- 
to a collapsed life capsule with 
three passengers at a time is 
warm work, so wear your shorts 
and check on the position of the 
cabinet containing the bathing 
gear. You will enjoy a soak after- 
ward as well as getting in some 
practice in weightless swimming 
before taking on your first two 
passengers.” 

“How do I explain wearing 
swimming shorts at breakfast 
time?” 

“Your problem,” said Prescott 
drily. “Who knows, some of them 
may enjoy the sight of a splendid, 
half-naked male animal.” 

“This male animal runs heavily 
to skin and bone — ” Mercer be- 
gan, But Prescott was already 
closing the seal behind him. 

By the time the passenger break- 
fast debris had been cleared away 
his costume had raised a few eye- 
brows but no comment, and when 
he reached the stage of rolling up 
the plastic walls and running the 
new film, Mercer had forgotten it 
himself. Prescott ran the film 
twice — MacArdle being off duty 
— so that everyone would know 



DARK INFERNO

how to enter a collapsed survival 
pod, how to do so quickly and how 
to help in any late arrivers or pas- 
sengers who had not quite got the 
idea with the minimum of wasted 
time and effort. Afterward Mercer 
went over the same ground with a 
slightly different emphasis. 

He began briskly, “We are hav- 
ing this drill today and will prob- 
ably have another one tomorrow. 
We must have at least three sur- 
vival instruction sessions as soon 
as possible after takeoff. That is 
the only reason. I apologize for 
the inconvenience the procedure 
may cause some of you, but it 
does have its compensations.” 

He nodded toward the camera 
pickup and in control Prescott 
operated the survival hatch 
activators. The covers sprang open. 

Mercer said, “The pods are posi- 
tioned at equal intervals around 
the waist of this compartment 
and if you simply head for the near- 
est one there should be no prob- 
lem. As you saw in the film, the 
first passenger to enter simply 
jumps in. The inner seal opens in- 
ward and closes automatically 
when pod pressure begins to build 
up before release. There is a drop 
of about eight feet as you enter but 
under half-G conditions this is 
no problem. Below your feet will 
be a plastic bag containing light- 
weight screens and other bits and 



pieces used for dividing the in- 
flated pod, also the service module 
and food store. 

“When the first passenger jumps 
into the pod,” Mercer continued, 
“he or she will drop until the feet 
touch the upper surface of the ser- 
vice module. In the uninflated 
mode the pod walls are folded and 
the convolutions project inward, 
so that there will not seem to be 
enough space for one, much less 
three people. But these folds are 
resilient and the first man in sim- 
ply presses himself backward into 
them, then raises his hands to help 
the next passenger into the pod 
in front of him. The second pas- 
senger in does not jump, but in- 
stead sits on the edge with his legs 
dangling inside and gripping the 
hatch coaming with both hands, 
ready to lower himself inside 
when the first passenger pulls on 
his legs. Once inside, the second 
passenger backs against the first 
and raises his or her hands to assist 
the third passenger in the same 
way. I would like to demonstrate 
the drill with two volunteers. Mr. 
Stone and Mrs. Mathewson, 
would you mind?” 

They did not mind and Mercer 
jumped in as Number One. Stone 
followed as Two and got in with- 
out any trouble, but he did not 
press backward against Mercer 
firmly enough so that Mrs. 



46 



GALAXY 




Mathewson found it a very tight 
squeeze. After much wriggling and 
elbowing her feet finally touched 
the floor of the pod and a murmur 
of applause went up from the 
watchers ringing the opening. 

One of them asked seriously, “If 
there were a real emergency, how 
much time would we have?” 

“You would probably have sev- 
eral hours to get ready,” Mercer 
said, trying to keep the back of 
Stone’s head out of his mouth, 
“but the drills are always carried 
out on the assumption that the ship 
must be cleared within a few min- 
utes, otherwise nobody would 
ever take them seriously. 

He heard a few passengers 
laughing, then another leaned 
forward to ask, “Does the rule 
about women and children first 
still hold in space?” 

“No,” said Mercer. “The rea- 
son for that rule at sea was largely 
because of the shortage of life- 
boats and the skilled manpower 
needed to launch them. We have 
more than enough pod space to 
accommodate all our passen- 
gers and launching is automatic. 
And now, Mr. Stone, if you will 
help Mrs. Mathewson out again 
we can all get back on deck. I’m 
beginning to feel like an overdue 
triplet down here.” 

That got another laugh and there 
were no more questions about 



emergencies. He suggested to 
Stone and Mrs. Mathewson that 
they go in first with two other pas- 
sengers each, all of whom would in 
turn instruct others until every- 
one had experience of at least one 
climb into a pod. 

“Leave them fend for them- 
selves,” said Prescott suddenly in 
his earpiece. “I’ll keep an eye on 
them from here while you go aft. 
Neilson wants you in E-Three — 
that’s the compartment on the oth- 
er side of the tank. The captain 
has a metal splinter in his arm — 
with complications. Grab your kit 
and take a look at him.” 

Mercer licked his lips and said, 
“Ladies and gentlemen. I’ll have 
to leave you for a few minutes. 
Just carry on with the prac- 
tice — you are doing fine.” 

UE DID not hurry toward his 
cabin while he was in sight of 
the passengers, but made up for 
lost time when he was not. Within 
a few minutes he was at the en- 
trance to the tank. From a nearby 
cabinet he pulled out a mask, visor 
and air tank and slipped them on, 
then stopped. 

With an injured arm the captain 
would not want to put on his space- 
suit again to come through the 
tank, so he would need swimming 
gear, too. And he had said yester- 
day that he did not want to risk 



DARK INFERNO 



47 




worrying the passengers by let- 
ting them see Neilson and himself 
wearing spacesuits. It might be 
better to bring along two sets of 
gear. 

“Mercer, hurry it up,” snapped 
Prescott. 

“Just leaving.” 

The tank lock was big enough to 
take three people in a pinch, he 
noted. In the tank itself he fum- 
bled around until he found the 
light switch and was immediately 
blinded. 

The tank was two-thirds full of 
the water which the nuclear 
propulsion system used as reac- 
tion mass and, because the ship 
was in free fall, it had not re- 
mained in the lower end of the tank 
when thrust had ceased. Instead it 
had spread to fill the whole tank 
with a glittering froth of bubbles, 
air pockets and irregular masses 
of water. It was impossible to see 
for more than a few yards into the 
stuff and it would be very easy to 
lose orientation. For a few sec- 
onds Mercer considered swim- 
ming to the wall and pulling him- 
self along the handgrips which 
projected from it, but that would 
take time. On the other hand, if he 
simply kicked hard against the 
bulkhead behind him and swam 
he should reach the other end fair- 
ly quickly even if he did not know 
exactly where he was on the way. 



The tank was only sixty feet long. 

As it happened the trip was far 
too short, giving him no chance 
really to appreciate the exquisite 
sensation of burrowing through 
clouds of bubbles and of being 
slapped and buffeted by air 
pockets and solid clumps of water. 
He almost forgot the captain. 

“How is it going, Mercer?” said 
Prescott. 

“I’m cycling the aft tank lock 
now. Everything is fine. The water 
is nice and warm.” 

“It shouldn’t be.” 

Mercer had no time to wonder 
about the warm water because the 
outer seal had opened and he was 
looking at his patient. 

Both men had their helmets and 
back packs removed. Neilson was 
holding the captain’s shoulders 
and Collingwood was gripping 
his right upper arm where smears 
of blood were visible above and be- 
low his fingers. The complica- 
tion Prescott had mentioned was 
that the splinter had entered the 
captain’s arm while he was out- 
side and he had suffered a fairly 
serious decompression — judg- 
ing by the condition of his eyes 
and the evidence of bleeding from 
the nose and ears — before the 
engineer had pulled him inside. 

Mercer pushed the magnetic 
studs of his kit against the deck and 
flipped open the lid. 



48 



GALAXY 




It rattled at him. 

He pulled the radiation counter 
from its clip and swung around. 
“You’re hot, for God’s sake! Both 
of you. Get out of those suits!” 
“Mercer, what’s happening?” 

IJEFORE trying to answer Pres- 
^ cott, Mercer took a few min- 
utes to run over the men with his 
counter — without actually touch- 
ing them or their suits. The thought 
of that invisible sleet of radiation 
going through his unprotected 
body was enough without adding 
the danger of surface contamina- 
tion. He wanted badly to dive 
back into the tank and put as much 
distance between the two poison- 
ously hot officers and himself as 
the dimensions of the ship would 
allow. 

“Both men have been splattered 
with radioactive material,” said 
Mercer. He cleared his throat be- 
cause his voice had sounded an 
octave too high. Then: “Neilson is 
shocked but does not seem to be 
physically damaged. The cap- 
tain’s suit was punctured and he 
suffered a rapid but not explosive 
decompression. There is bleed- 
ing from the ears and nose, some 
boil-off from the tear ducts, some 
lung damage, too, judging by his 
difficulty in breathing — ” 

“Captain, what happened?” 

“He probably can’t hear you,” 



said Mercer. “But surely the an- 
swer can wait. We have to get them 
out of the suits fast. The radioac- 
tive material must be adhering 
very loosely to the suit fabric. It 
could come loose and drift about 
waiting for us to breathe it in — we 
may already have breathed it in. 
Can you come down here? I need 
help.” 

“You’re right, the answers can 
wait,” Prescott replied calmly. 
“And sorry, I can’t help you, nor 
can MacArdle — our power in- 
strumentation is beginning to 
look very sick and we’ll be busy for 
a while. Neilson, do a fast un- 
dress of the captain and yourself. 
It means ruining the suits, but no- 
body will be able to wear them for 
about fifty years anyway. Move — 
and do exactly as the doctor or- 
ders.” 

Mercer looked at Neilson, who 
still seemed dazed, and said clear- 
ly, “Strip off your spacesuits, 
coveralls, everything, as quickly 
as possible. Try not to con- 
taminate the skin while taking 
them off. Have you got that? Then 
put on the air tanks, breathing 
masks and shorts. Inside the tank 
try to create as much turbulence as 
possible with your hands and feet 
to wash off any hot stuff that may 
have stuck to your skin — ” 

He broke off, wondering why he 
had thought it necessary to men- 



DARK INFERNO 



49 




tion the shorts at a time like this. 
Was he hoping that this sudden 
emergency might not be as serious 
as it seemed, that the ship’s super- 
men would cure their vessel’s ills 
while he performed the same ser- 
vice for its captain and that in a 
few days’ time the problem would 
have shrunk to lesser importance 
than that of allowing two ship’s 
officers to appear before the pas- 
sengers minus their shorts? Was he, 
in fact, trying hard to reassure 
himself? The answer was a defin- 
ite yes. 

Neilson was performing a 
weightless adagio dance with the 
captain as he began withdraw- 
ing Collingwood from his suit. 
Mercer went forward to help, but 
stopped when the engineer said 
sharply, “Don’t touch. I have 
gauntlets and you haven’t. This 
won’t take long — be ready with his 
breathing gear.” 

When Neilson pushed the 
captain toward him, Mercer put 
his mouth close to Collingwood’s 
ear and said loudly, “I’m dressing 
you for the tank, sir. You can 
spend a few minutes getting used 
to the breathing mask before we 
go in. Try not to cough.” By the 
time he had slapped a temporary 
patch on the arm wound, Neilson 
was crowding into the lock be- 
hind them, carrying a large, 
cylindrical case. 

50 



“You take this, Mercer,” he 
said, pulling up his mask to speak. 
“You’ll need it later. I’ll take care 
of the captain.” 

But the captain was trying to 
take care of himself, even though 
his eyes were still squeezed shut 
and he continued to leak blood 
from the nose and ears, kicking 
out with his feet and moving the 
water around his body with his 
good hand. When they went 
through to the passenger section 
he was even able to walk. He 
looked a bit unsteady, but no more 
so than the passengers who were 
experiencing their second day in 
weightless conditions. Neilson, 
without being too obtrusive about 
it, was guiding him while pretend- 
ing to fuss with Collingwood’s air 
tank. Mercer had plugged the cap- 
tain’s ears and nose with cotton 
when they came out of the tank and 
had left the visor in place instead 
of pushing it onto his forehead. 
The condensation on the inside 
of the glass hid Collingwood’s 
eyes from the passengers. 

“Both of you go to my cabin,” 
he told Neilson quietly. “Put the 
captain in bunk Three — it’s 
shielded — and stay there yourself. 
Don’t risk contaminating the 
control room until I’ve checked 
you again. I’ll be with you in a few 
minutes.” 

He stopped then and looked at 

GALAXY 




the passengers around and above 
him. Their clothing was dis- 
heveled, their hair mussed, their 
faces red and most of them were 
smiling. With an effort Mercer 
made his face do the same, but be- 
fore he could speak there was an in- 
terruption. 

“I would like a swim,” said Miss 
Moore loudly. She looked much 
more mussed than any of the oth- 
ers, but seemed quite happy about 
it. “You promised us a swim to- 
day and you three have been in — ” 

“Yes, ma’am,” said Mercer 
quickly. “These two officers are 
the captain and the engineer. 
Rank has its privileges and the sur- 
vival drills must come first. But 
right now I suggest that you re- 
place the — ” 

“Negative, Mercer, negative,” 
said Prescott sharply. “For the 
time being I want the pod hatches 
open and the cabin dividers out of 
the way. Do you understand?” 

Some sort of accident aft, warm 
water in the tank when it should 
not have been warm, the engineer- 
ing instrumentation looking 
sick and the passenger compart- 
ment to remain ready for evacua- 
tion. Mercer understood. 

He held his smile in place and 
went on, “I mean, of course, 
resume the drill. You all know 
what to do now. Just try to do it a 
little faster. Try hard.” 



“If we tried it two at a time,” 
said one of the men, “it might be 
easier to get the hang of it.” 

“Three to a pod,” said Mercer 
firmly. “The third passenger is a 
necessary requirement, to act as 
chaperone.” 

They were still laughing when he 
hurried after the captain and 
Neilson. Mercer wanted to tell 
them to stop laughing and to tell 
them the reason they should stop 
laughing and instead start learn- 
ing to survive as fast as they could. 
But the rules did not permit. 
Terminal cases were never told that 
they were going to die until — or 
unless — all hope was gone. 

VIII 

¥N THE sick bay Neilson insisted 
^that Mercer dress properly be- 
fore he touched either of his pa- 
tients. He snatched open the con- 
tainer the doctor was still carrying 
and began helping Mercer into the 
anti-radiation garb it held — loose 
pants that came up to his armpits, 
a combination hood and cape, 
elbow-length gauntlets and heavy 
periscopic goggles. The material 
was flexible but heavily leaded. In 
free-fall conditions the weight did 
not matter, but the inertia made it 
difficult to initiate a rapid move- 
ment and just as hard to stop it. 

Neilson told him that the rig was 



DARK INFERNO 



51 




used while checking hot sections 
of the reactor in pressurized 
areas. Mercer thought that he had 
felt cooler in turkish baths, but the 
feeling of protection the rig gave 
him more than outweighed that 
disadvantage. 

The captain was the more 
serious case of the two and Mercer 
felt guilty about treating the engi- 
neer first. But with luck Neilson 
would need only simple medica- 
tion — something to steady him 
without making him sleepy — to 
be fit for duty, while Mercer did 
not at the moment know what, if 
anything, he could do for the cap- 
tain. So he went over Neilson with 
his radiation counter, square inch 
by square inch, so intently that 
when Prescott’s voice sounded in 
his earpiece he nearly lost the 
counter. 

“Can I have the captain and 
Neilson back, Mercer?” 

“Neilson is clean and fit for 
duty,” Mercer replied, “but the 
captain is a more complicated 
case — Neilson will tell you about 
him when he sees you— and will 
need a longer examination.” He 
hesitated for a moment, wanting 
an answer but not trusting him- 
self to ask the question in case his 
fear would show. Then he took the 
plunge. “How much time am I 
likely to have?” 

Prescott also hesitated and 



Mercer could imagine him trying 
to decide whether to be reassuring 
or truthful. Finally he spoke. 

“The way it looks now, Mercer, 
nothing sudden or dramatic is 
likely to happen for at least 
another hour, perhaps two. If the 
situation changes you will be the 
first to know.” 

Mercer thought that the first 
officer had sounded both truthful 
and reassuring — quite a trick in 
the present circumstances. He 
turned, stuck his medical kit at a 
convenient height and strapped his 
feet securely to the floor grill be- 
side the captain’s bunk. 

He had to begin by treating the 
symptoms rather than the multiple 
ailments in order to make the cap- 
tain as comfortable as possible 
before curative procedures could 
begin — always supposing that a 
cure was possible with non-spe- 
cialized instruments and medica- 
tion in weightless conditions. He 
managed to get Collingwood to 
relax his eyelids and open his 
eyes. Mercer did not like what he 
saw. The captain, of course, could 
see nothing. 

“Your eyes are swollen as a re- 
sult of the decompression, sir,” 
Mercer said clearly, putting his 
face as close to the captain’s ear as 
the leaded hood and goggles would 
allow. “You can’t see at the mo- 
ment and will not be able to do so 



52 



GALAXY 




until the incidental damage in 
the area has had a chance to repair 
itself. I’m going to apply some 
cream that will make your eyes 
more comfortable and aid the 
heeling. Then I want you to shut 
them and keep them shut for a few 
days to give the medication a 
chance to work. I shall probably 
have to repeat the application un- 
til you have specialist attention. 
But now I’m going to pad and 
lightly bandage your eyes, mostly 
to remind you not to use them.” 

He attended to the damaged 
eardrums next, saying that no 
doubt MacArdle would be able to 
modify one of the intercom ear- 
pieces to serve as a hearing aid for 
the remainder of the voyage. Then 
he checked for bladder and anal 
damage, leaving the lungs — where 
the major damage was most likely 
to have occurred — until last. 

By then Collingwood was not a 
prepossessing sight. The minor 
blood vessels lying just under the 
skin in areas where his spacesuit 
had not been a close fit had dis- 
tended or ruptured due to the 
decompression. The captain 
looked as though a gang of profes- 
sional protesters had worked him 
over — or like the victim of a tat- 
tooist gone mad. 

“Would you mind coughing in- 
to this, sir?” said Mercer, after he 
had sounded the lungs with his 



stethescope. He was beginning to 
get used to the idea of rotating his 
weightless patient instead of him- 
self moving around. 

“I’ve been trying not to cough 
for hours,” said the captain. 

“Now you have permission, sir. 
And spit, too, if you can.” 

Mercer examined the results, 
glad that the captain could not see 
them. 

He said, “There is some evidence 
of lung damage — not unexpected, 
but it could have been much worse. 
You must have expelled most of 
the air from your lungs as soon as 
you realized that your suit had 
been pierced.” 

“Yes, Doctor — and screaming 
bloody murder. It hurt me. It still 
hurts me.” 

“I’m sorry about that, sir,” 
Mercer replied, “but I had to be 
sure that your heart and lungs were 
in shape to take a general 
anesthetic if one became neces- 
sary. As things are a local will do 
fine. In a few minutes you won’t 
know that you even have an arm, 
much less one with a hole in it.” 

While the injection was taking 
hold Mercer strapped the captain 
firmly into the bunk, tying down 
his legs, arms and waist only so as 
not to constrict his chest. He be- 
gan to probe the wound, the radia- 
tion counter keeping a raucous 
accompaniment. 



DARK INFERNO 



53 




A n hour later he was still 
■ probing and two tiny specks of 
radioactive metal were wasting 
their energies on the walls of a lead 
container, when the cabin speaker 
came to life with a voice which 
Mercer did not recognize at first. 
But then he realized that the 
strange sound was Prescott being 
polite. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, the sur- 
vival drill period is now at an end. 
If you will kindly stand clear of 
the pod hatches I shall close them 
and allow you to replace your 
cabin dividers and have lunch. 
Thank you.” 

Prescott did not have a personal 
message for Mercer — obviously 
he was supposed to read between 
the lines of the PA announce- 
ment, which made it clear that the 
ship was not nearly as sick as 
Mercer had thought. 

He treated and dressed the arm 
wound, now clear of contami- 
nated metal. But the radiation 
counter still did not sound happy 
and he soon found out why. 

There were two other points of 
emission, separated by a little 
more than three inches, deep in the 
right lung. Probably Colling- 
wood had inhaled the particles 
while Neilson had been pulling 
him out of his spacesuit — or the 
pieces could have been carried 
from the site of the arm wound 



through the subclavian vein and 
superior vena cava, heart and 
pulmonary artery, doing a fair 
amount of damage every inch of 
the journey. Now they lay like two 
tiny incendiary bombs, slowly 
burning the life out of the sur- 
rounding tissue and killing off 
red corpuscles by the hundred. 

With the medical facilities avail- 
able in the ship Mercer could not 
remove them — more accurately, 
with his relatively crude radia- 
tion counter he could not pinpoint 
their position close enough to dig 
for them without killing the 
patient. And if he did not remove 
them they would kill Collingwood 
anyway. Mercer did not know 
whether the time available to his 
patient would stretch beyond the 
scheduled end of the trip or if he 
would have to request Prescott to 
abort and head for home. 

In a similar situation at sea it 
would have been a simple matter 
to return to port or whistle up a 
chopper with a medical crew on 
board and transfer the casualty to 
a shore hospital. But Eurydice was 
using the orbital speed of Earth 
arid the gravity of the sun to help 
speed her on her way and she might 
not carry enough reaction mass to 
kill her present velocity, build up 
enough speed for a fast return and 
then kill that velocity, too. 

Only Prescott could give him an- 



54 



GALAXY 




swers. The first thing Mercer had 
to know was the time available. By 
keeping the captain under close 
observation for a few days and 
checking on the cumulative ef- 
fects of the radiation, Mercer 
thought that he could probably 
make a rough estimate of the time 
needed, but he would also have to 
make allowances for the effect of 
the decompression damage and 
any psychological factors that 
might aid or retard recovery. 

Physically Collingwood was in 
very good shape. Psychological- 
ly? Mercer remembered the 
hostess who had ridden with him 
in the coach to the launching pad, 
the smiling, generous, beautiful 
girl who was the captain’s wife, 
and decided that there would be no 
problems about the patient’s not 
wanting to live. 

While he was still thinking about 
the captain’s wife and remem- 
bering how she had asked him to 
look after her husband and every- 
one else, Mercer administered a 
sedative shot and, after some hesi- 
tation, a three-day PC which 
would render the patient less excit- 
able, more fatalistic and willing 
to accept suffering without com- 
plaint. He waited until Colling- 
wood was asleep, then closed his 
bunk and slid it into its recess. 
After that he took off and stowed 
away his protective clothing and 



changed into his uniform, care- 
fully checking the zips and the 
angle of his cap. 

The ship might have been ready 
to blow up a few hours earlier, but 
somehow Mercer did not think 
that danger would be an accepta- 
ble excuse to Prescott for sloppi- 
ness of dress. Before leaving the 
cabin he switched over the bunk 
mike so that he would be able to 
monitor the captain’s breathing 
from his position in control. 

pRESCOTT gave him a few 
^ minutes to settle down, turn up 
the gain on the captain’s monitor 
and check on the passengers 
through the vision pickup. Most 
were in their cabins, but a small 
group stood aft, watching the 
antics of two girls who were flap- 
ping their arms and pretending to 
be birds in the weightless section 
between the passenger compart- 
ment and the tank. The mikes 
brought only the sounds of the two 
human seagulls and amused noises 
from the watchers. 

“We heard you talking to the 
captain,” said Prescott finally. “It 
sounded encouraging. Is he going 
to be all right?” 

“He isn’t fit for duty and won’t 
be for the rest of this trip,” said 
Mercer carefully. “As for being all 
right, that depends very largely 



DARK INFERNO 



55 




on the health of the ship. How is 
your patient?” 

Prescott looked at him sharply, 
then said, “At present we have two 
additional options to that of aban- 
doning ship. The first is that we 
proceed as originally planned. 
This will necessitate testing the 
nuclear reactor briefly to make 
sure that it will work properly dur- 
ing deceleration at the other end. 
This additional spurt will mean 
minor course corrections and will 
eat into our safety reserve of reac- 
tion mass, but not significantly. 
The second option is to abort the 
trip and head for home as quickly 
as possible. This will leave us with 
no reserves at all. So you can see 
that the ship is very sick but should 
survive, barring complications. 
How does this affect the health of 
your patient?” 

Mercer briefly described Col- 
lingwood’s condition, the treat- 
ment and medication he had been 
able to give, and explained the dif- 
ficulty of giving an accurate prog- 
nosis until he had a chance to 
observe his patient over a longer 
period. 

He concluded: “I have no idea 
of the intensity or duration of the 
radiation he was exposed to at the 
time of the explosion that punc- 
tured his suit — ” 

“It wasn’t an explosion. Doc- 
tor,” said Neilson suddenly. 



“Think of holding u pencil in each 
hand and pressing the unsharpened 
ends together, hard. As long as the 
pressure is directed evenly along 
the axes of the pencils, nothing 
happens, but the slightest lateral 
pressure can result in broken 
knuckles. When the captain be- 
gan removing the control rod 
retaining sleeve— Well, he said 
that we were to stay off the suit-to- 
sh ip frequency because he did not 
expect to find trouble and he was 
afraid that not finding it would 
make me say , something that 
might embarrass Prescott. When 
it happened I didn’t even remem- 
ber the radio until we were inside 
and then I did not know how 
serious it was until you started 
yelling that we were hot — ” 

“This isn’t an official enquiry, 
Neilson,” Prescott broke in. “I 
have already tried to tell you that 
the blame for this mishap lies with 
the final assembly and inspection 
people — they fitted six perfect 
actuator rods, except that one of 
them was the wrong size. I doubt 
that even prelaunch inspection 
would have caught that one — they 
look for the minor errors, the tiny 
ones that can sometimes slip past 
the inspectors farther up the line, 
not major structural blunders like 
this. You stood very little chance 
of spotting it even if you had 
suspected that something was

wrong and, as you well know, my 
earlier displeasure with you was 
caused by your not properly in- 
specting an entirely different 
system that has not given any 
trouble. If there is an official in- 
quiry you will be commended by 
me for your fast rescue of an EVA 
decompression case. So stop 
craving absolution for someone 
else’s sin, concentrate on your 
board and shut up. Go ahead. Doc- 
tor.” 

Mercer nodded. He was begin- 
ning to realize that Prescott was a 
fair rule-of-thumb psychologist 
even if his thumb was somewhat 
calloused. Neilson had obviously 
been feeling guilty about the acci- 
dent and now the only person who 
might still have thought him re- 
sponsible — Mercer himself — knew 
otherwise. The final blast was sim- 
ply a reminder to all concerned, 
also reassuring in the present cir- 
cumstances, of who was boss and 
the bearer of the ultimate respon- 
sibility. 

“If the trip proceeds normally,” 
Mercer resumed, “he might not 
survive it if the radiation he 
underwent was intense — or he 
may survive with a rapidly 
developing leukemia if frequent 
transfusions are available to keep 



him alive. No doubt there will be 
donors of the right blood type 
among the passengers, but while 
those two fragments of metal re- 
main in his lung — ” 

“There is no chance at all of dig- 
ging them out?” 

“They are tiny,” said Mercer. 
“It would be like spooning out 
strawberry jam to find two spe- 
cific pips.” 

“Please,” said MacArdle, look- 
ing slightly sick. 

“We don’t carry the specialized 
equipment needed to treat him,” 
Mercer said seriously, “and his 
condition is grave enough to war- 
rant our turning back, if you have 
the reaction mass to do so.” 

“We have,” said Prescott, “and 
we will turn back.” 

Mercer could not hide his relief, 
even though a fair proportion of it 
was for his patient. He said, “Not 
a direct return and landing, sir. 
Reentry deceleration might kill 
him and if he did survive it re- 
covery would be much slower in a 
surface hospital. Station Three 
has all the facilities to put him 
right.” 

“Station Three,” said Prescott 
dryly, “can cure my patient, too.”

DARK INFERNO

A THUNDERING surf drowned 
the forlorn screams of sand- 
locked. Rorqual Maru. Brine- 
tossed grains of olivine and calcite 
buried her left eye, blocking her 
view of the sky. Uranus had 
marched thirty times through the 
constellations while the island’s 
changing beaches had slowly en- 
gulfed her tail. Six hundred feet 
of her shapely hull lay hidden un- 
der a silted and rooted green hump 
of palm and frond. Now the sea 



was completing her interment, us- 
ing cemented shell grit and granu- 
lated porphyritic basalt from an- 
cient lava flows. 

As the eyelid of sand darkened 
her world. Rorqual wept over her 
irretrievable, wasted years. She 
was a harvester without a crop — a 
plankton rake abandoned by Earth 
Society when the seas died. Her 
search of the continental shelves 
had proved futile; marine biota, 
negative.

Her sisters had quietly sunk, lit- hearty hails, the sweat anu £he 
tering the bottom with their skele- laughter. She needed man. 
tons. She had selected this island 



for her grave, hoping to keep her 1\EEP in the Hive a dispenser

vage. up. Enjoy. Enjoy.” 

Although her long ear heard Fat old Drum, a forty-eight- 
nothing she believed that man still inch and balding Nebish, sat up in

return to sea she wanted to serve, bical. Pleasures of retirement 
She longed for the orgasmic thrill awaited him after two grueling

aged nineteen — and wealthy, for 
he had earned enough CBQ for 
this private six-foot cubicle and a 
flavor with every meal. He was 
vigorous also — possessed of a 
clear lens and eight good teeth. 
Some eleven more years remained 
on his life span. 

“Welcome to the awake state, 
suave citizen,” chortled dispenser. 
“Today’s distribution is well above 
calorie-basic. The screen scene 
looks promising. Select two fla- 
vors and refresh while your gour- 
met meal is prepared. Two glori- 
ous flavors on this glorious day.” 

“Pink and green?” mumbled 
Drum hesitantly. 

“Those are whole categories,” 
reminded dispenser, “Which pink? 
Which green?” 

Frugal citizens were often un- 
sophisticated in matters of lux- 
uries. Drum had invested a large 
part of his credits for retirement. 
He had qualms about adjusting 
his consuming habits upward. 

“I’ll start with pink-one and 
green-one and work my way down 
the menu — try them all,” he said, 
feigning excitement. 

When he stepped out of the re- 
fresher he found seven, soft, bag- 
like packets in the edible chute — 
five gray, one pink and one green. 

“Savor the flavor,” sang dis- 
penser. 

Humming a cheerful tune. 



Drum took his utensils from the 
cupboard and ceremoniously ar- 
ranged the Hive’s pseudo-consom- 
me, -souffle and -parfait; liquids, 
pastes and puddings. All stable 
foodstuffs. No perishables. Dis- 
penser selected a pulsing geomet- 
ric visual with sonics to soothe 
subcortical neurones during the 
meal. Drum tried a generous bite 
of the green paste and experienced 
a tart shock — more a color than a 
flavor — that faded quickly into 
the usual dull pap. He frowned; 
his appetite jaded. Where were the 
pleasures of retirement? 

Dispenser detected his irritation 
and changed channels. Sonics 
flexed. Drum’s bio-electricals 
showed negative happiness. 

“Some residual job fatigue re- 
mains in you,” rationalized dis- 
penser. Lights dimmed. “A nap 
will invigorate you. Lie down, 
please.” 

Audio switched to woodwinds 
and strings. Drum’s cot vibrated. 

Hear the bacon frying. 
Crackling in the heat. 

Just smell those aromas. 

Good enough to eat . 

Drum awoke to choking synthe- 
smoke and the clang, clang, clang 
of a ranchwagon triangle. The 
viewscreen carried an old histori- 
cal still showing rolling green hills 



60 



GALAXY 




dotted with squarish blobs of fau- 
na, simple wooden artifacts — hut, 
fence and tools — and a bright blue 
sky. He sat up, relaxed and smil- 
ing. This new odor did excite him. 
Olfactory luxuries were quite 
rare. He hurried to the chute but 
found only three tube sandwiches — 
— soft, gray sticks. He frowned. 

“One is laced with bacon,” of- 
fered dispenser. 

Drum forced a grin and picked 
it up — bland paste with a rare 
crunchy particle. The flavor was 
more that of burned grease than 
of any delicacy. Shrugging, he 
packed the other sticks into his 
kit. 

“Where do you wish to go, be- 
loved citizen?” 

“To visit Grandmaster Ode.” 

“Sorry,” said dispenser, “but 
commuter density is three point 
two per square yard on the spi- 
ral — four point one in tubeways. 
Rush hour. It would be better to 
wait until between shifts for your 
recreational travel.” 

Drum sat down slowly. Com- 
muter priority had gone with his 
job. Now he couldn’t even walk 
around when density was above 
two. Shrugging off his disgust, he 
called Ode on the screen. 

“Got time for a game?” he 
queried as he unrolled his chess 
board. 

The grandmaster smiled out of 



the screen. He did not comment 
on Drum’s abrupt manner, for he 
understood the status changes of 
retirement. 

“Pawn to queen-bishop-four.” 
said Ode. 

Drum moved the worn pawn 
and studied the position for an un- 
usually long time. He moved 
woodenly until the tension level of 
the middle game position washed 
away his depression. He rode into 
the battle on his knight. Rooks 
clashed magnificently. A pawn- 
fork took the survivor. A nervous 
king fidgeted in his castled posi- 
tion until his reign was ended by a 
pair of bishops. For the moment 
the game took on a meaning big- 
ger than life itself. 

O N THE following morning 
Drum awoke a bit more phil- 
osophical. He was about to ac- 
cept his new status for what it 
really was, but dispenser had oth- 
er plans. 

“Let me see a view of the 
jammed tubeways,” said Drum. 
“I want to appreciate the quiet of 
my cubicle.” 

The screen remained blank — on 
standby. 

Drum smiled. 

“What is commuter density? 
Three? Four?” 

A dry female appeared on the 
screen. She had an air of efficien- 



RORQUALAAARU 



61 




cy about her that Drum didn’t 
like. Her thin lips and gaudy 
smock clashed. 

“Recertification time,” she said, 
her smile pasted on. 

Drum’s mouth opened and 
closed. 

“Society has run a bit short of 
calories,” she explained. “Water 
table dropped three centimeters in 
our sector and the harvest re- 
flected it. We’ll be cutting back on 
the warm, consuming population 
for a while. Please vote for those 
citizens with whom you walit to 
share next year. Hurry, now. 
Your friends need your vote to 
avoid being put into Temporary 
Suspension — TS. Remember, you 
must not vote for yourself or 
your clone litter mates. No blood 
prejudice is allowed.” 

Drum smiled nervously. He had 
done this before, but he did not 
enjoy it. He used to vote for his 
conductor, a Venus attendant and a 
job mate — but now he was more 
concerned with the plumbing and 
the air in his little cubicle. 

“My votes go to my friend 
Grandmaster Ode, this city’s 
Tinker, and the pipe caste mem- 
ber who keeps my refresher work- 
mg. 

The screen switched to geome- 
tric dance, then printed out an or- 
der for his own Temporary Sus- 
pension. 



The thin-mouthed female reap- 
peared long enough to announce: 
“You failed to receive your nec- 
essary three votes, so it is TS for 
you.” 

“But I’m retired,” he objected. 
“My calories and quarters are paid 
up for life.” 

The screen blanked. Dispenser’s 
voice answered his plea. “Recerti- 
fication has nothing to do with 
wealth. The only criterion is love. 
Without love there can be no li- 
cense for life.” 

“My funds — ” 

“Your retirement funds remain 
in your name while you are in TS. 
When harvests improve you’ll be 
rewarmed. Hurry. You are to re- 
port to the clinic immediately. The 
air you are breathing belongs to 
somebody else.” 

WHE signs read: vs left, ts 

RIGHT. 

Drum lined up with the unloved 
TS candidates of mixed ages. On 
his left was the line of cachectic, 
sick, elderly citizens hoping to sur- 
vive Voluntary Suspension long 
enough to be awakened when their 
physical problems could be solved. 
Drum knew how hopeless the sta- 
tistics were. 

Grandmaster Ode joined him in 
line. 

“You didn’t manage enough 
votes either?” asked Ode.

Drum shook his head. “I wish 
all those damn embryos weren’t 
protected by future job requisi- 
tions. It would be much less trau- 
matic just to lower the birth rate 
for the duration.” 

Ode shook his head. 

“Those future jobs keep the Hive 
going. If no Tinkers were born to- 
day the shortage would be felt ten 
years from now — we would have 
no trainees. Of course, if job quo- 
tas drop the embryos loose their 
protective vote like anyone else.” 

A job hawker walked between 
the lines shouting, “Get your job 
vote here. Work outside your 
caste. Many rewarding positions 
available. Apply now.” 

“Let’s chance it. I’d try any- 
thing to avoid TS.” said Drum. 

Ode was reluctant to leave his 
caste, but Drum pulled him out of 
line with a rough grip on his arm. 

“Two volunteers right here,” 
shouted Drum raising his hand. 

The hawker gave them each a 
voucher. They showed it to the first 
optic they came to. The CO (the 
Class One meek that balanced the 
books for Earth Society) con- 
firmed their unfrozen assets. The 
jobs were in the Sewer Service — 
dark, wet work. 

T he glowing meteor trail lit 
the night sky. Strange celes- 
tial voices tugged at Rorqual’s 



long ear. Booming mushrooms of 
plasma pocked the dark ocean. 
Rorqual’s consciousness flickered 
as her sensor thresholds were vio- 
lated. She sucked the Big H from 
the sea to feed her growing belly 
fires. Her strength returned. Flex- 
ing and squirming, she began to 
worm her flanks out of the impri- 
soning silt. Warmth filled her hull. 
Her deep dish eyes rose out of the 
blinding olivine and gazed into 
the lagoon. The waters had 
changed. Incoming spectra were 
fuzzed by nanoplankton. 

She pulled away from the is- 
land. Roots and vines snapped. 
Tree trunks split. She reentered 
the sea, carrying a hump of vege- 
tation firmly locked into her back 
by gnarled woody roots. Salty, 
wind-blown spray followed the 
roots through damaged plates and 
burned her vitals — until layers of 
electroplating and oxides crusted 
over the sensitive, exposed circuits. 

Joyfully she toiled the straits — 
raking and pumping. Only faint 
traces soiled her membrane filters 
during the first year, but her chro- 
matographs identified all the 
amino acids. Protein had returned 
to the sea. Growth bloomed. Dur- 
ing the second season larger crea- 
tures were caught on her rakes — 
soft copepods, heteropods with 
bizarre delicate shells, chaeto- 
gnaths and dinoflagellates. Earth

Society would be pleased with her 
harvest. Man would be pleased. 

II 



I N ANCIENT undersea ruins 
an occasional building meek 
survived and maintained its air 
pocket. It survived to serve a non- 
citizen, the Benthic — a marine 
hominid that filled one of the 
niches abandoned by the Hive. The 
Benthics were a sullen, thick- 
necked race. The concept of ter- 
ritorial integrity was strong in 
their culture. They lived in small 
family units separated by miles 
of open ocean. 

Big Opal glanced around her 
ten-fathom nest. The fruit bin was 
low. She had scarcely enough for 
an offering to the Deep Cult. She 
would have to be the one to raid 
the Gardens again, since her mate 
had lost a leg in the meteor show- 
er. An astrobleme-induced tsu- 
nami had shifted a mountain of 
debris, trapping him in the ruins. 
H is left foot had been badly 
crushed and had gone purulent — 
it had to be amputated. The burden 
of feeding the family had fallen on 
Opal’s broad shoulders. 

“I must swim up to the Gar- 
dens,” said Opal, patting her two 
young children. Clam, her oldest, 
was an adult. 



Ray nodded. He and the chil- 
dren watched her climb down 
through a toothy rent and swim 
up past the swaying transparent 
walls — her pink breasts and but- 
tocks shimmering through the 
cloudy waters. Since the meteor 
shower there had been a drop in 
visibility. 

Opal swam leisurely among the 
ruins. Most had died and wore an 
opaque shroud of marine scum, 
but some buildings lived and of- 
fered her the hospitality of their 
bubbles. She approached a tall, 
mushroom-shaped dwelling whose 
walls glowed with life-giving air, 
heat and light — Halfway House. 
She bobbed up in the living-room 
pool. 

“Welcome,” said a wizened, 
hairy Benthic — the Listener. 

She climbed, dripping, up the 
ramp to where he sat among his 
wires — the communication web. 
He held a bowl of water and ap- 
peared worried. 

“What do you hear from the 
surface?” she asked. 

“Nothing yet, but I fear I have 
seen a harbinger of evil — the krill.” 

He held up a red crustacean. It 
flipped back into the bowl. 

“The krill have returned?” she 
exclaimed. 

He nodded gravely. 

“Why, that’s wonderful. I’ve 
seen them in the murals — good 



64 



GALAXY 




food from the seas. We’ll never 
have to go up into the Gardens 
again! What’s wrong?” 

A tear started down Listener’s 
wrinkled face. He pointed to his 
communication web. “The Hive 
will see the krill, too. It will come 
to harvest the seas again and drive 
us out. Our children will have no 
place to hide — no place.” 

Opal was stunned. The Benthics 
had lived here for generations. 
She knew the Hive had built the 
ruins in the distant past, but she 
never dreamed it would return. 
The ocean was the refuge of her 
people. She jumped up and shook 
her fist at the ceiling. 

“We’ll fight the damned Hive,” 
she muttered. 

S EVERAL fathoms overhead the 
surf dulled with soupy green and 
yellow blooms — diatoms, algae 
and salps. After one sleep Opal 
swam up to the Gardens and stole 
her share of the harvest. Agro- 
mecks trundled about their chores, 
ignoring her. At dusk she tied her 
melons into a raft and rode the 
rip current toward Halfway 
buoy. A few stars blinked down at 
her. The western horizon still 
glowed a faint blue when a silhou- 
ette appeared against it — nearly a 
quarter mile long, low and dotted 
with trees. 

It was right in her path. 



An island where no island 
should be. The current carried her 
up to the smooth, slightly granu- 
lar beach. With her raft vine in one 
hand she examined the trees — ^jum- 
bled leaves, trunks and vines — nat- 
ural enough. She tied her raft and 
began to explore the shoulder-high 
brush under the palm canopy. She 
found a hillock at one end of the 
beach. At first she thought it was 
just a heap of boulders, but it was 
hollowed out. Inside she found 
glowing ornaments and bright, 
blinking stones. The floor was lit- 
tered with small tools, seaweed and 
pinching crabs. 

Rorqual trembled at the touch of 
bare feet. The huge harvester 
tried to speak, but air molecules 
did not respond — she could make 
no sound, managed only a flimsy 
printout that resembled an ob- 
scure falling leaf to Opal. Ex- 
citedly Rorqual tried an offer- 
ing. Chewing cellulose mulch in- 
to a hydrocarbon, solution, the 
meek polymerized and extruded 
a small tool. Opal picked it 
up — curious. Next the meek 
formed a small doll in the likeness 
of the wet, naked guest. It was rub- 
bery and translucent — a tough 
polymer. 

Opal’s curiousity was quenched 
abruptly by what she saw through 
the porthole. The island had a 
wake— it was moving! She cursed 



RORQUAL MARU

and ran, diving overboard with- 
out her melons. 

T hree Benthics sat in Halfway, 
watching the shadow pass over- 
head. 

“That’s it. It is looking for me,” 
Opal whispered. 

“A floating island?” asked her 
son. Clam, her eldest, had come to 
see what had delayed her. 

Listener shook his head. 

“The Leviathan,” he said, blink- 
ing beady eyes under shaggy 
brows. “The Deep Cult has stud- 
ied them in old ballads and mur- 
als. It is not an island. It is a crea- 
ture that gathers krill for the 
Hive — a giant mutation of the 
finback whale. Did you notice the 
control cabin?” 

Opal nodded. “A little room?” 
“Attached to the back of the 
skull,” he explained. “The Hive 
must have had hookups between 
machines and the hapless crea- 
ture’s brain and muscles. The Hive 
crew could steer it anywhere, ig- 
noring its usual migrations. We 
don’t know how they bred them.” 
“A sea creature controlled by 
the Hive,” mumbled Opal. She 
didn’t at all like the idea. 

rpWO fat Nebishes, Drum and 
^ Ode, entered the sewer meek’s 
control room. The wall was cov- 
ered with pulsing flow diagrams; 



lights indicated water levels, 
gate status and silt/surface ra- 
tios. 

“Welcome trainees,” said the 
meek, a voice in wall. 

“What jobs are open?” Drum 
asked, sitting down slowly. “I’m 
trained in music. Ode is grand- 
master — ” 

“Wet crew,” snapped the meek. 
“You’re late. Your boots and shov- 
els are out in the landing — through 
that hatch. Since my dredge died 
there has been an endless amount 
of shoveling to do.” 

“But our backgrounds — ” ob- 
jected Drum. 

Ode touched his arm. “We’ll 
take it. We need the vote.” 

“Wear the belts and helmets so 
1 can keep an eye on you in the 
pipe,” instructed the meek. 

They splashed along the thirty- 
foot-diameter pipe, guided by the 
eerier bioluminescence of Panus 
stipticus mycelia growing in the 
drying sludge high on the walls. 
Sewer meek directed pencils of 
light from their belts. 

“There’s a weir,” said Drum’s 
belt. 

Drum and Ode paused and shov- 
eled at the silt dam. A lightbeam 
focused on a horned slug the size 
of Ode’s foot. 

“Pick it up,” said his belt. 

Ode nudged the slug cautiously 
with his shovel. 



66 



GALAXY 




“What is it?” 

“Sewer slug — a gastropod. Fla- 
vors.” 

“Edible?” asked Ode. 

“Good perishable flavors,” said 
his belt. “Fringe benefits of the 
wet crew. Put it in Drum’s belt 
pail.” 

As they worked their way down 
the tube the belts pointed out oth- 
er delicacies: snap larvae, 

worms, fungus balls and slime 
pods. When they approached the 
tidal sump the air took on a brack- 
ish odor and marine photobac- 
teria glowed blue-green in the 
men’s footprints. 

“Don’t walk out on the delta,” 
warned Ode’s belt. “It is too soft 
and drops off rapidly.” 

Ode strained his eyes across the 
sump. 

“1 can’t see across. How wide is 
it?” 

“About three hundred feet,” 
said his belt. “My lights won’t car- 
ry that far.” 

“There seems to be something 
out there that is closer than three 
hundred feet,” said Ode. 

Drum heard the lapping of 
small waves against an obstruc- 
tion about thirty feet into the 
darkness. His belt’s lights pulsed. 
He caught a brief glimpse of a mot- 
tled wet wall. 

“That is not supposed to be 
there,” said his belt. “My sensors 



indicate a large disturbance. 
Hurry to the out hatch.” 

The two Nebishes climbed a ser- 
vice ladder to the barracks^ — to 
bright lights and warm air. Drum 
pulled off his boots. The skin of his 
feet was white and badly wrink- 
led, but there were no blisters or 
sores. He sorted through his pail of 
edibles. A snap larva swam on 
small oar bristles. 

“What’s the tithe?” asked Ode. 

“Fifty percent,” said his belt. 
“Drop half your perishables 
down the flavor chute to Synthe. 
Divide up the fluid and grit al- 
so.” 

They paid their tithes and sat 
back while several of the regular 
wet crew members showed them 
how a handful of live creatures 
added an entire new dimension 
to the pseudoconsomme. 

“I call this my sewer bouilla- 
baisse,” said the Nebish with the 
spoon. “You stir it carefully so 
you don’t fragment the little crea- 
tures — keep them whole so you 
know exactly what you are eat- 
ing.” 

ril HE Synthe chute passed 
^ through a sorting meek. Each 
species had its own peculiar fla- 
vor. The meek indexed these and 
also passed the creature census 
report along to the boys in Bio 



rorqual MARU 



67 




who were struggling with data on 
extinct species. 

“New species?” asked the meek. 

Its companion teck awoke, 
glanced into the viewer, reached 
in and gave the new glob a squeeze. 

“No. Just half a sewer slug.” 

The meek went back to sorting. 
At shift’s end Harry-the-courier 
brought contraband bamboo for 
the teck’s weaving and picked up 
the spec bottles on the way to Bio. 

“The tiny vial has an old oto- 
lith,” said the teck. “That new wet 
crew must have dug real deep.” 

Harry nodded and trotted off. 

“Another fossil otolith,” he an- 
nounced as he entered the labs at 
Bio. Wandee, an unpolarized 
fern teck, was bent over her bub- 
bling tanks. 

“Put it down and take a look at 
this,” she said. 

Harry leaned over her shoulder. 
The viewer contained amor- 
phous blobs of green. The water 
looked scummy to him. 

“Algae?” 

“No,” she said, smiling. “A flag- 
ellate — only no flagella. The gene 
spinner finally identified the 
flagellar codons and built this 
creature’s DNA without it.” 

“How are you coming with the 
marine biota?” 

“Slow. We’re still mapping the 
DNA of fresh-water diatoms 
and algae. But less than five per- 



cent of the code has been cracked. 
We did find the eye spot — and now 
the flagella. I even have one syn- 
thetic creature that will live in 
seawater but must return to fresh 
water to reproduce.” 

“What does the spinner say?” 
asked Harry. “How close are 
we?” 

Wandee straightened up and 
wiped her hands. 

“Spinner’s WIC/RAC has come 
up with a lot of ‘what ifs’ and ‘ran- 
dom association’ theories, but 
I’d need a lot more personnel and 
floor space to follow them all up. 
We’re just time-sharing now. I can 
try out a couple of likely maps 
each week, but there are actually 
millions of possibilities. It would 
be easy if we just had one marine 
protozoan to map and decode. Get- 
ting membrane pumps to work 
against hypertonic solutions after 
evolution has selected a life form 
for a fresh-water environment 
takes an entirely different set of 
enzymes — RNA and DNA. It’s 
slow.” 

She walked Harry over to the 
fossil otolith. They placed it in 
the hood for analysis and sat down 
for a glass of foamy. The flimsy 
printout had a red “attention” 
trim. 

“This is no fossil,” she said 
breathlessly. “It is contempor- 
ary!”

“Impossible,” 

They both studied the images on 
the viewer. The isotopes were in 
contemporary ratios. There was 
no evidence of leaching, ion drift 
or mechanical wear. 

“I know it is impossible,” she 
said. “But there was a real live 
bony fish in the sewer recently.” 

ARCLIGHTS crackled in the 
^ pipes as the teams of samplers 
spread out and began their net- 
ting and digging. 

“Bring some nets down here by 
the delta.” 

“What’s that smell?” 

“Oh, oh, I don’t think we’ll be 
needing those nets.” 

Attracted by the voices, Rorqu- 
al Maru cruised down the sump to- 
ward the delta. Her hundred-and- 
fifty-foot beam was half as wide as 
the sump. Before her drifted a 
spongy wall of brine-soaked bis- 
cuits. The Nebishes backed away 
as her towering, barnacled hull 
nosed gently into the mud. Bale- 
ful optics gazed while pails were 
nervously filled. 

“Plankton,” chirped Wandee. 
“Look at this printout. There are 
over a hundred species here that 
have been labeled extinct.” 

Harry flaked another biscuit in- 
to the sorting meek. 

“How could it have happened? 
Where did all these come from?” 



Wandee shrugged. The meek 
passed the question along to the 
CO — the Class One meek also had 
neural connections with all the 
continents. In a few hours Harry 
had his answer. 

“Meteor shower,” said CO. 
“The marine biota reappeared 
three point two years afterward. 
An astrobleme must have opened 
an atoll or other landlocked body 
of salt water where these species 
had survived.” 

Harry nodded. 

“It is lucky that whatever 
caused the sea death in the first 
place was no longer active,” he 
said. 

“Doesn’t look like it. Things are 
really flourishing. Lots of food 
out there now.” 

“Who will harvest it?” 

HI 

rpHE platoon of orange-suited in- 
^ signia wearers crept into the SS 
barracks and nudged Ode. As the 
grandmaster opened his eyes the 
ensign handed him a captain’s 
coveralls. 

“Whom do you want?” 

“You, Captain — sir,” said the 
ensign curtly. “You have been 
named to command. We’ll voy- 
age on plankton rake Rorqual 
Maru — the whale ship. CO’s or- 
ders, sir.” 



RORQUAL MARU

Ode glanced around at the pla- 
cid, young faces of his crew — bare- 
ly mature children. He pulled on 
the coveralls and thick-soled 
boots. His belt was wide and or- 
nate. Drum sat up on his cot and 
watched the drafting of Captain 
Ode. He shook his head slowly. 
He wondered why a grandmaster 
would be commissioned to pilot 
a rake. Did the reason lie in his 
military experience on the chess 
board — or the simple fact that 
Ode had been first to spot the ves- 
sel? 

“Good luck,” said Drum sadly. 

“Smile,” said Ode. “It is an hon- 
or to captain the first vessel re- 
turning to the sea. A turning 
point for the Hive. More food for 
all. They’ll be opening the ship- 
yards and building copies of Ror- 
qual. We’ll all have a great time.” 

“Be careful, anyway,” cau- 
tioned Drum. “You aren’t used to 
being Outside. No one knows 
very much about the seas these 
days — ” 

Captain Ode waved his friend to 
silence and marched off with his 
crew. 

PRIORITIES were juggled as 
^ the Hive attempted to get the 
shipyards working again. Meek 
brains were taken from dispen- 
ers, doors and every manner of 
machine. They were carted up and 



delivered to the flooded, cor- 
roded ruins by the sea. Crane and 
lathe robots were heaped into a 
rusted mass with twisted girders, 
cables, plates and other scrap 
gear. The Nebish work crews 
found their jobs impossible. Ev- 
erything was too heavy or too 
sharp. Tinkers and pipes were 
pulled from their cities for a 
while — and returned when efforts 
at the yards failed. 

The CO sent requisitions to the 
gene spinner for laborers with 
broader shoulders and thicker 
skins. It would be many years be- 
fore a finished ship slid down the 
ways. 

Drum took a detail of citizens 
Outside to string the long ear in an 
effort to establish contact with 
Captain Ode. The detail wore the 
closed-environment suits, but 
“outside phobia” tightened 
Drum’s chest as soon as they 
stepped into the spacious Gar- 
dens. Bright sun glinted off gaudy 
flowers. Leafy plants hushed hu- 
man voices and cut off men’s views 
of one another. Three work- 
ers — each finding himself alone in 
such a wide open space — collapsed 
in their agoraphobia and died. 

The towers of the long ear stood 
on a hill and reached up into the 
sky. Glassy insulators clung to 
spider-web-thin struts. The struc- 
ture appeared delicate, swaying 



70 



GALAXY 




in the wind. More than half the 
crew was unable even to approach 
the towers. Many of the men who 
made the climb only lasted a few 
hours before dropping to the 
ground in heaps of fractures. Re- 
placements arrived. Spools were 
creaking at the base of the towers 
as wires were strung up and down 
the antennae. Stretcher teams 
jogged back and forth with their 
splinted burdens. Fresh details 
were sent out at dusk to spell the 
survivors. They worked through 
the night, swaying against a star- 
strewn sky. Darkness erased most 
of the landmarks so the Nebish, 
limited by his helmet light, 
worked more comfortably. 

Several days later Drum rea- 
lized where the structure got its 
name — an oblong dish, a rabbit’s 
ear, was slowly taking shape. 

APTAIN ODE lost six crew 
members to agoraphobia. An- 
other dozen or so were in various 
stages of catatonia. 

Rorqual raked well. Her hold al- 
ready bulged with a hundred thou- 
sand tons of food for the Hive. 

The alarm siren called Ode’s at- 
tention to the viewscreen. The 
deep scanner had picked up a Ben- 
thic silhouette and the nets were 
bringing it in. For a while Ode 
thought the captive might be canal 
sirenian or pinniped, but as it 



was brought closer he saw that it 
was humanoid, naked and primi- 
tive. The crane extruded a soft 
polymer net and gently dragged 
the body up on the deck. The crew 
shuddered at the size of the brine- 
soaked hulk: six feet long — two 
feet taller and a hundred pounds 
heavier than a Nebish. It wore a 
rope belt, had leathery burnt-sien- 
na skin and large five-toed feet. 
The crew scattered, wet boots 
squeaking. 

The Sharps Committee met 
and issued Captain Ode a curved 
blade. He walked up to the Ben- 
thic and nudged it with his boot. It 
was cold, stiff — lifeless. As a pre- 
caution Ode cut the left carotid 
artery. The blood was purple and 
jellylike. Eight Nebishes carried 
the Benthic down to the freezer. 
Ode reported it as a fossil homin- 
id, theorizing that it had thawed 
out of some glacier and drifted 
down in a bottom arctic current. 

The CO bounqed Ode’s report 
back to Drum with more data. The 
five-toeds were classified as ex- 
tinct — fossils — but the Benthic was 
no fossil. Jellylike blood was 
quite recent and the inner lining 
of the cut artery was still 
white — the intima was not yet 
stained. Drum called Captain Ode 
over the long ear. 

“So you finally got the com- 
municator working.” Ode grinned. 




RORQUALMARU

“What’s new in the shipyards.’’ 

“Nothing going on at all here,’’ 
said Drun\. “But we are a little 
worried about you— and that Ben- 
thic beast you pulled in yester- 
day/* 

interesting fossil.” Ode 
shrugged. “But you should see our 
harvest—” 

“That’s no fossil,” warned 
Drum. “Maybe the meteors 
brought back the five-toed homin- 
ids, too — or maybe they’ve been 
out there all along. Anyway — they 
are dangerous.” 

“Nonsense.” Ode laughed. 
“Why everyone knows — ” 

Sirens announcing the approach 
of another Benthic beast inter- 
rupted him. Rorqual's course held 
steady until the beast climbed 
aboard — then the contact with the 
bare feet sent shudders through 
the whole ship. 

“Sharps Committee — ” Ode 
shouted. 

Panic broke out on deck. Boots 
squeaked and slipped. The crew 
scattered. Two men fell over- 
board. Others fled into the trees 
and below decks. Only two from 
the Sharps Committee made it to 
the captain’s office. They fum- 
bled their keys into the weapons’ 
locker, but two of the keyholes 
were still empty. The door 
wouldn’t budge. 

“Defend the ship,” shouted the 
72 



captain. “Use any weapon you 
can find.” 

The siren continued to rise and 
fall — bewailing the ship’s fate. 
Even knives and forks were locked 
up. Tbe reluctant squads that 
climbed back out onto the deck 
were carrying such useless things 
as spools, drinking jugs and 
chairs — nonweapons. The brine- 
soaked, naked beast towered over 
them, puzzled. Someone threw a 
four-inch bolt at him. It missed, 
but it clarified the situation in his 
mind. He lunged into the little 
Nebishes, kicking and flailing. 
Soon the decks were splattered 
with rose-water blood and five- 
toed footprints. Captain Ode was 
still tugging on the door to the 
weapons’ locker when the Ben- 
thic dismembered him. 

Drum cursed his helplessness 
as he monitored the one-sided bat- 
tle. The Benthic was not even 
wounded, yet he had slain the en- 
tire ship’s complement. He 
tracked red below decks until he 
found the frozen body of the other 
Benthic. This seemed to satisfy 
him. He weighted it with tools and 
jumped into the ship’s wake with 
it. 

FURIOUS Drum stomped in 
on the Hive committee meet- 
ing. 

“Why does Rorqual have to re- 

GALAXY 





main neutral? We lost the whole 
crew to a creature the ship could 
have dispatched with one swat of 
the crane.” 

The Security representative, a 
fat compromisii^ neuter, turned 
piggish eyes to him and spoke slow- 
ly, didactically. “Your ship is 
equipped with the WIC/RAC 
genius circuit. I understand this 
enables it to survive in very hostile 
environments. However, we learned 
a long time ago that our genius 
machines must never be given the 
option of killing a hominid of any 
kind. It might discover a good rea- 
son to kill all of us.” 

Other committee members nod- 
ded. Even the CO, one mention- 
ed, used a citizen to push the but- 
ton that actually executed cap- 
ital offenders. 

Drum sat down, mumbling, 
“Then why send a crew at all? The 
ship harvests pretty well alone.” 

“The Rorqual Maru must be 
manned at all times,” ordered CO. 
“She takes long voyages and gets 
lonely. To permit her to sail alone 
is to invite a commandeering by 
the Benthics.” 

The teck from Synthe stood up. 

“The plankton clouds are wide- 
spread. I’m sure we can plot a 
course that avoids areas controlled 
by the Benthics.” 

“And,” said Wandee from Bio, 
“we are working on the genes of a 



new prototype citizen who will 
be able to fight the Benthics. A 
stronger, bigger citizen — who 
will also fill the job requirements 
at the shipyards.” 

“Big enough to handle a Ben- 
thic with his bare hands?” asked 
Security. 

Wandee nodded. 

“Why— his body would he 
classified as a weapon. How 
would you insure his loyalty?” 

“Just as certain ants insure the 
loyalty of their warriors. We’ll 
design him so he can’t feed him- 
self.” 

Drum was shocked. “Do you 
mean — no esophagus or no hands? 
Something like that?” 

Wandee smiled. “Oh, nothing 
so crude. He won’t even notice 
anything amiss. We’ll delete one 
of his key metabolic pathways so 
he’ll be dependent on a special 
diet only the Hive can give him. 
Without it he’ll sicken and die.” 
Drum shuddered. He was sorry 
he had asked. A tied-off esopha- 
gus could be corrected by a friend- 
ly Tinker. What could the poor 
warrior do about a defective en- 
zyme system if he wanted to quit 
his job? Nothing. 

“Here is a copy of the traits we 
hope to program into the genes of 
our warrior,” said Wandee and 
handed him a clipboard. 

Drum glanced at the list. 



RORQUALMARU 



73 




“Sounds good, but will it walk?” 
he asked. 

“Walk, run, swim — and fight,” 
said Wandee. 

Drum was skeptical. 

“How can you be sure? Just last 
year spinner couldn’t construct a 
gene map for marine protozoa. 
Now you think you can spin us a 
superman?” 

The clipboard was passed 
around the table. The battle gear 
it listed was impressive: heavy 
bone and muscle, a fast reflex 
time, high pain threshold, potent 
neurohumoral axis . None of 
the committee members really 
understood the details of gene 
spinning. Wandee wanted to quiet 
Drum’s objections without ex- 
posing the other complacent 
Nebishes at the table to a lot of 
disturbing new terms they might 
not understand. Drum had an ex- 
ceptional grasp of matters be- 
yond his specialty and more — he 
had an open mind. 

“Growing the prototype warrior 
is entirely different. We do not 
have to build an entirely un- 
known gene — as we were trying to 
do with marine biota. Human 
genes have been mapped many 
times and about twenty percent of 
the map is pretty well understood. 
Enough for us to design certain 
broad traits we are interested in. 
We will use the known map of the 



most primitive human we have 
on file — Larry Dever — from be- 
fore the Era of Karl. We still have 
some of his alpha renal nuclei in 
suspension. By using his chromo- 
somes — and deleting what we don’t 
want — we have relatively few genes 
actually to assemble.” 

“Assemble a Larry Dever?” 
asked Drum. 

“Modified. We’ll grow an aug- 
mented Alpha Renal Nucleus of 
Larry Dever — an ARNOLD — 
with the traits listed.” ' 

The chairman had dozed off. He 
awoke with a start. 

“You two can continue this dis- 
cussion down in the spinner labs. 
Meeting adjourned.” 

11 RUM marveled at Wandee’s 
^deft manipulations. The meio- 
tic renal cell was spilled into the 
sorting chamber filling the 
screen with X- and V-shaped 
chromosomes. She selected those 
to be augmented: a large D acro- 
centric ^13; two B subraetacent- 
rics #4 and 0 and an F metacentric 
#19. They were moved into the 
cutting chamber. Her electron 
pencil carved as she talked. 

“We’ll cut off half of these long 
arms at the secondary constric- 
tion — a good landmark. Remove 
those little satellites — and take 
off the short arms from this late 
replicator. Careful of that 



74 



GALAXY 




centromere. There, now — plenty 
of room for translocating the 
synthetic chromatids from the 
spinner’s bath.” 

The bath (a soup of purines and 
pyrimidines) contained the enzyme 
reverse transcriptase — the RNA- 
dependent DNA polymer.ase. 
(RNA molecules act as templates 
for the replication of DNA genes.) 
Spinner assembled the RNA tem- 
plate: GCAUGGAUCUU— gua- 
nine, cytosine, adenine, uracil, gua- 
nine, etc. When added to the soup 
a DNA gene replicated: CGTAC- 
CTAGAA — cytosine, guanine, 
thymine, adenine, cytosine, etc. 
Each grouping of three bases 
formed one codon (or letter) in 
the genetic message. 

“This appears to be an excessive 
amount of the Grube-Hill gene,” 
suggested Drum. He had been 
studying spinner’s screen where the 
molecular activity was being simu- 
lated. 

“A triple dose of gristle.” Wan- 
dee smiled. “Our ARNOLDS will 
be real mechanized-armor bucks 
with triple calcium, collagen, phos- 
phatase and growth hormone.” 

Drum nodded, frowned. “But 
what is this sequence? It does not 
translate.” 

“The Hive safety factor — a non- 
sense sequence where the gene lo- 
cus for amino-acid synthesis should 
be. The bases have been scrambled 



to UAA, UAG and UGA, which 
do not translate at all. The AR- 
NOLDS will be unable to synthe- 
size six of the amino acids you and 
I can manufacture from the inor- 
ganic constituents in our diet. Lor 
ARNOLD, alanine, aspartate, glu- 
tamate, glycine, serine and tyro- 
sine will be essential — along with 
the other nine all of us need in our 
diet. ARNOLD’S diet must con- 
tain these fifteen essential amino 
acids or he’ll become protein-defi- 
cient, weaken and die.” 

Drurrt was silent. He felt uneasy 
about building the ARNOLD — a 
human who would lay down his 
life for the Hive, not realizing 
that the Hive had implanted in him 
this molecular time bomb that 
would kill him if he became sepa- 
rated from the Hive. Drum felt 
himself to be more of an enemy to 
ARNOLD than the Benthic beast. 

A codon GAG was changed to 
CAC, substituting the histidine let- 
ter for a glutamine — another non- 
sense sequence closing the transa- 
minase “back door” to one of the 
amino acids. ARNOLD would not 
be able to get his amino acids even 
from his Kreb’s cycle. 

Playing with the Watson-Crick 
structures was tedious work, but 
soon Wandee had several clones 
working on the prototype AR- 
NOLD DNA. 

“We can sort the cells out of 



RORQUAL AAARU 



75 




culture on the basis of their Grube- 
Hill content. Those with a lot of 
phosphatase fluoresce the brightest 
with this labeled substrate. We’ll 
embryonate about a thousand of 
the triple GH’s first.” 

Wandee hovered over the foam- 
ing nutrients and plated the pla- 
cental matrix with the first hundred 
cells that showed chorionic tenden- 
cies (villi and gonadotropins). Soon 
the embryos were visible under 
the magnifier. 

Wandee seemed pleased. 

“Size and length of tail are good 
indexes at this stage,” she said. 
“But I like to rely almost entirely 
on the Organ of Zuckerkandl — the 
chromaffin tissue near the inferior 
mesenteric artery. It is a good in- 
dex of the neurohumoral axis. Au- 
tonomic tone, sex organs and 
adrenal medulla function can usu- 
ally be predicted by studying the 
O.ofZ.” 

Drum nodded. ‘.‘And how many 
toes?” 

“Oh, they’ll all be five-toed, of 
course.” 

T wenty thick-necked, hairy 
infants survived Wandee’s criti- 
cal culling. They were tested re- 
peatedly and the six most vigorous 
were turned over to Mullah. The 
rest went to shipyard nurseries on 
high job priority.

Warrior human beings 
Under Hive’s control —

Fp ANGLED girders and crusted 
^ plates were the tapestries for 
Listener’s eulogy on the funeral 
raft. Benthics crowded around the 
weighted body. They were gathered 
in the far bubble of a torn tube- 
way overlooking the yawning 
blackness of the abyss. The body 
drifted for a long moment. Then it 
began to sink slowly, accompanied 
by a halo of zooplankton fighting 
over its nitrogen treasures. 

“The Leviathan is not a whale?” 
asked Listener. 

“A ship,” said Clam. “1 was all 
over her insides. I saw no sign of 
an organ or a muscle of any kind — 
just rooms and machines.” 

“But this machine — it showed 
signs of life after you had driven 
the crew away?” 

“Yes. I heard and felt things I 
didn’t understand. But I’m certain 
it knew I was there. It opened 
doors for me and followed me with 
little eyes in the walls.” 

“And it didn’t try to harm you.” 
Listener smiled. “Wonderful. I’ll 
bet the Leviathan is a friendly 
ship.” 

“But it killed Peter,” objected 

GALAXY 




Clam. “The nets caught him at 
fifteen fathoms and pulled him up 
until the pops got him.” 

“Perhaps that was an accident,” 
suggested Listener. “A surface 
machine like the Leviathan may 
not know about the pops. That is 
one of the secrets of the Deep Cult. 
I think we should try to capture the 
Leviathan. Perhaps we can learn to 
talk to it.” 

Opal said, “It might be able to 
protect us from the Hive.” 

The Benthics passed the word 
along the reef. The ocean would be 
theirs. 

Y OUNG ARNOLD buckled on 
^ his harness while the workmen 
loaded his two-wheeled cart. He 
munched on the crust of 15- 
amino-acid bread. All his food was 
handed to him by his supervisor. 
He leaned into the straps. Wheels 
creaked. It was a two-hour run to 
the top of the spiral. 

Citizens were already lined up 
at the dispenser when he arrived. 
The pressure had fallen again and 
they would have had to go down to 
shaft base for their calorie basic if 
it weren’t for ARNOLD’S training 
runs. 

“Good time, ARNOLD,” said 
the workman who had ridden in the 
cart. He climbed down and handed 
ARNOLD a yellow-4 sweet. 

ARNOLD squatted in his har- 



ness, chewing his treat. He was 
only six years old, but was already 
the size of an average citizen. His 
powerful calf muscles tingled after 
the workout. Soon he would be 
trained to work in the shipyards, 
they had told him. The work was 
important — clearing rusted debris. 
He was a very bright ARNOLD. 
He understood everything real 
fast. His mentors hardly ever had 
to use the whip any more. 

That night he slept under his 
cart at the loading docks. He had 
lots of room to stretch out. The 
workers on the shift made hardly 
any noise at all. His chains were 
real long — a light new alloy. He 
was fed his special 15-AA bread 
six times a day. He had lots to eat 
and grew fast. 

D rum sat on the edge of the 
wagon and offered ARNOLD 
an orange-3 sweet bar. 

“All of us are Reincarnation- 
ists,” said Drum, speaking slowly. 
“We believe in the transmigration 
of the soul. Our souls lived in oth- 
er bodies, even other creatures, be- 
fore inhabiting our present ones. 
We go to the chapel and try to 
feel some experience from a previ- 
ous life. We learn to understand 
ourselves better — become better 
citizens. Would you like to do that, 
ARNOLD?” 

ARNOLD nodded. 



RORQUAL MARU 



77 




“You may find that you weren’t 
always a draft animal,” said Drum. 

ARNOLD grinned. He did not 
understand what Drum meant. 

An appointment was made with 
Mullah. 

ARNOLD appeared at the chapel 
^with Drum at his elbow. He was 
almost two feet taller than the av- 
erage citizen as he walked down 
the aisle, his chains going ching, 
ching, ching. The walls of the chap- 
el were covered with the Darwinian 
Transmigration from amoeba 
through invertebrates, lower verte- 
brates and finally the highest ani- 
mal — the four-toed Nebish. The 
robed Mullah directed ARNOLD 
to put down his chains and stretch 
out on the heavily telemetered 
couch. The links clattered noisily 
to the floor. Four meditecks tubed 
and wired him to the sensory tape 
machine for a review of his phylo- 
genetic tradition — his leptosoul. 

“Let’s see if we can establish a 
common language between the 
tapes and ARNOLD,” said Mul- 
lah. They watched the encephalo- 
gram as a combination of drugs 
and midbrain trickle current sup- 
pressed ARNOLD’S conscious- 
ness. 

“It will take several sessions be- 
fore leptosoul imagery is clear. 
The symbols we will start with are 
basic: itch, thirst, hunger, sleep. 



sex — things like that. The itch is 
useful in localizing a sensory mes- 
sage. It is better than pain or heat 
or cold, because the itch stimu- 
lates you to do something other 
than simple withdrawal. The itch 
gets you to scratch. Notice the 
readouts. He is getting a good re- 
sponse to both central and periph- 
eral itching.” 

Drum watched the ARNOLD 
get exposed to thirst, probably 
one of the oldest phylogenetic 
memories dating back to the time 
life left the seas. Hypertonic fluids 
bathed key receptors, making 
him physiologically thirsty. Neu- 
rological thirst came with sterio- 
tactic sonic stimulation of the 
thirst center in the brain stem. 
Psychological thirst was induced 
by images of dust, dry leaves, 
skeletons and a distant lake mi- 
rage. Heat and a throat itch 
brought physical thirst. AR- 
NOLD writhed and suffered 4-D 
thirst. The thirst stimuli were 
turned off and cool, hypotonic 
fluids were flushed into his 
stomach. 

“Hunger can be a bit dan- 
gerous,” warned Mullah. “When 
we sag his blood glucose under 
forty milligrams we run the risk 
of causing brain damage. We lost 
several citizens early this month 
during this step. The tubes empty 
his stomach and pucker the rugal 



78 



GALAXY 




folds with cold water. Insulin 
drops the blood sugar. The hunger 
center in the brain stem is stimu- 
lated and the itch is located in the 
mouth.” 

ARNOLD experienced visions 
of skeletons familiar to him from 
the thirst sequence, only this time 
he wanted to stuff his mouth with 
meat pies and sponge cakes. The 
stimuli were stopped and relief 
came in a visual image of the hand 
of the Hive carrying pies and 
cakes. 

Mullah looked up. 

“Sex is an important warrior 
drive. We can use it for imprint- 
ing and motivating other lesser 
drives. A mature male is the best 
engineered warrior in terms of 
muscle and bone. Testosterone, 
you know. For this imagery we lo- 
calize the itch in the genital region 
and the neural stimulus in the 
basal ganglia. We can program a 
variety of sexual encounters for 
imprinting. The last symbol is 
sleep. The itch is a bright red aster- 
isk behind the eyelids. Neural 
stimuli play with his alpha 
rhythms.” 

“That seemed to be a good 
session,” commented Drum. 

Mullah nodded. 

“Since he is to be a warrior, we 
might as well offer him a little 
vivid imagery to take home with 
him.” 



Stag ARNOLD perched 
on a low fir limb, reigning 
over beautiful speckled 
Frost Gray hens. They 
scratched and pecked in 
musty humus. He smelled 
aromatic pine needles and 
saw glistening grubs. The 
power of his spur stubs made 
him cock of the knoll. The 
day before he had knocked a 
great yellow cat from this 
very limb. The sex urge pulled 
him from his perch. He 
swooped down on a pretty lit- 
tle hen and grabbed her by 
the short feathers. She 
squawked and struggled, but 
he pinned her to the ground, 
mated and strutted off with a 
cavalier air. Flustered, she 
preened her disarray. Crow- 
ing, he returned to his 
perch . 

The leptosoul experience left 
young ARNOLD puzzled. Resid- 
ual euphoria made him want to 
crow. As he gathered up his chains 
he stared at the links for a long 
time. They seemed out of place 
now that he had relived part of a 
regal background. He, ARNOLD, 
had been a king — a feathered war- 
rior — a game fowl. 

Drum watched the giant leave. 
He shook his head slowly, saying, 
“Poor ARNOLD. The Hive has a 
big job for you.”

“I think he is equipped for it,” 
said Mullah. 

Drum eased himself down on 
the edge of the couch. Raising 
ARNOLD had drained him. One 
lens had clouded over and all his 
teeth were gone. He had little time 
left. 

“ARNOLD has a big job,” con- 
tinued Drum, “and he can never re- 
tire.” 

“Why?” 

“The safety factor. We pro- 
gramed his genes so he can’t make 
fifteen amino acids. He can never 
live on calorie basic. In fact, he 
can live on nothing in the Hive ex- 
cept his own special fifteen-AA 
crusts. If he lacks just one of those 
amino acids his protein synthesis 
stops. He sickens and dies rather 
horribly — swollen with edema 
fluids, bleeding, ulcerating, para- 
lyzed.” 

Mullah said, “But if he works he 
will eat. Everyone does his 
share — some do more. Look at 
yourself. Drum. Once you stepped 
outside your caste the Hive had 
you doing everything and any- 
thing to keep your Recertification 
job vote. You’re the oldest out-of- 
caste laborer I’ve ever seen. 
ARNOLD won’t have it any 
tougher than that.” 

“Unless he becomes obsolete. 
He’s very specialized, as you well 
know.” 



niG OPAL cautioned her adven- 
^turous daughter White Belly to 
stay away from South Abyss. 

“Leviathan has been sighted 
there. Leave her to the males. 
Clam is taking his mussel scrapers 
there today. You work North 
Reef” 

White Belly nodded reluctantly 
and swam north. She had been a 
surface baby — born in Halfway 
House. She had spent much of her 
youth swimming around buoys 
and soaking up solar UV. Melano- 
cytes darkened. Her freckled, 
brown back and pale abdomen had 
given her her name. 

Born too late for raiding the 
Gardens— the Hive was once 
again active Outside — she was now 
being denied the excitement of 
hunting the Leviathan. 

¥>RUM studied the ocean charts. 
^The years of raking had given 
the Hive a good picture of plank- 
ton distribution along the shelf 
where upcurrents carried nutri- 
ents from the ocean floor. Benthic 
beasts were also located on the 
shelf — in the flooded ruins of old 
Rec Centers around the twenty- 
fathom range. 

ARNOLD was ten years old 
now. His years in the shipyards 
had hardened his body. His visits 
to the chapel had strengthened his 
leptosoul.

GALAXY 




Capon ARNOLD roosted 
with other fat-bottomed neu- 
ter birds — neither cock nor 
hen. Each had his own mush 
cup and water. ARNOLD 
was restless. His soul 
remembered when food had 
flavors and hens were 
speckled. He tried to stir up 
his roostmates by pushing 
them away from their mush 
and eating it himself. They 
wouldn’t fight. They just low- 
ered their heads. He gained 
weight rapidly and invited 
an early axe. 

END OF TAPE. NEW 
LEPTOSOUL: BATTLE- 
COCK. 

Battlecock ARNOLD was 
all testicular valor and iron 
spur. His days of secret train- 
ing in the keep had hardened 
his body and strengthened 
his wind. A hundred times a 
day he had been tossed by the 
hand. Each time he flew back 
to his windowsill to look out 
into the hen yard. His diet 
removed extra water and 
fat from his body: Twelve 
kernels of corn, chopped 
cooked meat, chopped let- 
tuce, wheat germ, honey and 
peanut butter. When his 
irons were tied over his spurs 



he knew someone would die. 
Odors of blood, tobacco and 
whiskey told him that other 
hands were there with their 
cocks. He rested comfort- 
ably in his handler’s arms un- 
til the time came to fight. He 
was placed in the pit with a 
Claret. Twice they went up 
and locked irons. Each time 
they were tenderly disengaged 
and placed back in the pit. 
ARNOLD was blind now. 
He had taken some iron in 
the skull. He couldn’t see the 
Claret, so he waited. When 
the Claret attacked he knew 
just where it was. 

ARNOLD went up, strik- 
ing out with his spurs. He 
felt the Claret’s iron in his 
belly and left wing. Then his 
own iron crunched cartilage 
and diced myocardium. 
When they were disengaged 
this time he was held in the 
arm and petted by the hand. 
He heard the Claret’s last 
coughs. 

When ARNOLD’S orbital 
hematoma subsided the 
hens were his. He was brood 
cock now — under wire — with 
three of the most feminine 
Frost Gray hens. The big hen 
tried to shoulder him away 
from the water, but he gave 
her a resounding peck. He 



RORQUAL AAARU

was king. Soon all three 
would be setting handsome 
clutches of eggs. 

One morning the wind 
brought a faint answer to his 
crowing. There was another 
cock on the other side of the 
ridge. He couldn’t wait for 
the chicken wire to be lifted. 

“This wire is the only thing that 
keeps you alive,’’ mumbled AR- 
NOLD. 

“Wonderful,” commented Mul- 
lah. “Notice how real these lepto- 
soul experiences have become for 
him. He is ‘ARNOLD the battle- 
cock’ in his subconscious. These 4- 
D sensory dreams have more 
significance than his dull routine 
of real life.” 

Drum studied the feedbacks to 
see if ARNOLD was showing 
maximum effects. There was still 
room for improvement. 

“Let’s step it up next time. We’ll 
run through these tapes with more 
energy — enhance the axe pain in 
the Capon sequence, build up his 
euphoria and sexual stimuli after 
the battlecock win.” 

“When does he sail?” asked 
Mullah. 

“Soon. Perhaps on his eleventh 
birthday. His testosterone levels 
are high enough. Epiphyses are 
closing. He’ll be ready.” 

“Yes. I’m sure he ll do fine.” 



A SULLEN CLAM stalked on 
South Reef. Warm body tick- 
ling sensors — his presence acti- 
vated ancient circuits, and fields 
of waving, man-sized umbrellas 
welcomed him. He swam toward 
Leviathan’s trawling lane paus- 
ing at two-fathom umbrellas to 
fill his lungs. Ahead of him the reef 
sprang to life. Meek pumps filled 
the umbrella air pockets. Snap 
electrolysis spiked the air with 
oxygen. Clouds of marine scum 
and overflow bubbles rose from 
the writhing shapes — cyber barna- 
cles that had survived the twenty- 
seven centuries to serve the rare 
fugitive Benthic. 

Clam waited at the edge of the 
reef. Behind him the umbrellas 
quieted. He watched the surface 
overhead. A dark sky spat big 
drops into the choppy water. Levi- 
athan’s whale-shape approached 
trailing nets. Clam left his air 
pocket and grabbed the fine mesh 
netting. In a moment he was on 
the rain-spattered deck. His 
boarding caused pandemonium 
this time. The siren initiated a 
regular cadence of squeaking 
boots. Rows of Nebish crew mem- 
bers lined up, carrying shoulder- 
high netting — walking fences. 
Clam leaped onto the cabin roof. 

Thunder rolled. Hump palms 
rustled in the wind. ARNOLD 
stepped out of the foliage and 



82 



GALAXY 




studied the Benthic — a hundred 
yards away. Both were six-foot 
giants; half again as high as the 
other crew Nebishes. Clam was 
dark-skinned, naked. ARNOLD 
wore standard coveralls with a 
wide, studded belt, but his big bare 
feet made flat sounds like Clam’s. 

“Hello,” shouted Clam, waving. 

ARNOLD silently motioned for 
the net fences to be lowered and 
advanced slowly across the rows 
of wet mesh. Clam glanced around 
for a possible attack from be- 
hind. The nose of the ship had no 
hatch. Beyond the hump the crane 
worked casually on heavy plank- 
ton netting. Only the deck crew 
and ARNOLD seemed to notice 
him. 

“I can let you live,” offered 
Clam,” if you give me this ship.” 

A cock crowed in ARNOLD’S 
subconscious. 

Clam couldn’t believe the fury of 
the attack. The ARNOLD had 
sprinted across sixty yards of open 
deck and leaped on him — kicking, 
biting and elbowing. They tum- 
bled down onto the deck. AR- 
NOLD’S teeth were crunching 
deep into Clam’s left forearm. A 
wave carried the fighters off the 
nose of the ship and the huge maw 
sucked them into the rakes. AR- 
NOLD’S fingers closed on Clam’s 
throat. The Nebish netters 
draped the pair with sticky tangle- 



foot mesh. Clam clawed at AR- 
NOLD’S fingers as his sensori- 
um clouded. The tunnel vision 
frightened him. He found AR- 
NOLD’S left middle finger and 
quickly bent it back — breaking it 
with a snap. He clung to the stump 
twisting it hard. ARNOLD’S grip 
slipped. Clam vaulted back into 
the sea, dragging the netting and 
three drowning Nebishes. 

D rum wheezed and patted 
ARNOLD on the forearm. A 
banjo-splint held the damaged fin- 
ger along with all four fingers in a 
fanlike position. 

“Good warrior. You did well. 
You are only eleven years old and 
you defeated the Benthic beast, 
saving the ship. The sea is open to 
the Hive.” 

ARNOLD smiled and nodded. 
He accepted the accolades and 
returned to the shipyards. When 
his injuries healed he’d captain 
again. 

Drum took the battle report 
down to the chapel. 

“We’ll have to step up his battle 
conditioning, use those heavy 
tapes — Dan-with-the-golden 
tooth.” 

Mullah programed his lepto- 
soul meek. 

“How far do you want to go with 
this? I’ve got one where Dan al- 
lows his head to be cut off so he can 



RORQUALAAARU 



83 




fight two battles at the same time. 
His head wins and then flops into 
the second pit where his body is 
holding the second contestant. 
He wins both fights, naturally.” 
Drum shook his head. 

“No, keep the battle physiology 
plausible in human terms. We 
want ARNOLD to use a little 
judgment. In name at least — and 
by the grace of some learning-tape 
conditioning — he’ll be captain 
of the ship. He’s programed for a 
little judgment — not much. 

Dan worked the cold fe- 
mur back in his mouth. Mo- 
lars cracked it open and the 
rusty marrow and crumbling 
bone distended his gastric 
rugal folds, loading his hepa- 
tic lymph with iron and calci- 
um ions. Dan sniffed the 
dirt, wondering where the 
other old bone was buried. 
Cluck. Cluck. His wards, the 
feathered friends in the coop 
were upset. 

Ears up, he watched the 
scrub pine. A massive in- 
truder appeared — black and 
hairy — walking on its hind 
paws. The intruder had long 
claws and sharp white teeth. 
It was twenty times his size. 
Dan froze to quiet his chain. 
The intruder was intent on 
the succulent coop dwellers. 



It failed to notice the circle 
of dead grass that marked 
chain’s end. As its big left 
hind paw entered the circle 
Dan leaped and sank his 
teeth into the black shaggy 
hide. Tendons jumped under 
his fangs. A hot tibia split. 
The intruder was down — 
howling. Claws and teeth 
ripped Dan’s hide open, snap- 
ping his spine and spilling his 
intestines. Dan tightened his 
jaw as darkness swallowed 
him up. 

Dan’s leptosoul floated 
above the gory scene. The 
bulky intruder limped off 
with a distinctive lump on its 
left ankle — Dan’s head. The 
baying of a pack of hounds 
and a rifle sound finished 
Dan’s job on the intruder. 

ARNOLD snorted, strode out 
of the chapel. Drum was im- 
pressed. He stayed behind to study 
the tapes. 

“What was this creature — this 
Dan-with-the-golden-tooth?” 

Mullah smiled eagerly, “These 
are the most aggressive lepto- 
soul tapes we have. I think the sub- 
ject was a small meat-eating pet 
that worked for man — protecting 
him against varmints big and 
small. He was so aggressive he 
had to be muzzled to be bred.”

“Why? Couldn’t he recognize a 
female?” 

“Yes, but apparently he fought 
anything that came into his terri- 
tory. Fought for wagers, too. But 
the beast obviously could not tell 
a bet from a stud fee, so he had to 
subdue any female he met to be 
safe.” 

“It certainly worked. Look at 
ARNOLD’S adrenergics.” 

Mullah frowned, “I hope this 
doesn’t endanger his Hive loyal- 
ty. Adrenergics like that in a citi- 
zen would make him a candidate 
for the psych clinic.” 

Drum wheezed and sat down. 
His jaw ached. 

“We needn’t worry about Ar- 
nold’s loyalty. He can’t live with- 
out the Hive’s fifteen-AA bread.” 
Mullah nodded, reminded of the 
safety factor in Arnold’s genes. 
Then he noticed Drum’s discom- 
fort. 

“Life span coming to an end? 
Want me to call VS?” 

Drum shook his head. He would 
live out his span warm. 

V 

O PAL changed Clam’s bandage. 

The toothmarks in his forearm 
had gone purulent, were draining 
cloudy pink fluids. The arm was 
swollen to twice its size and the 



fingers would not move. Fever 
racked his body. 

“He still smells foul,” com- 
plained sister White Belly. 

“If that arm doesn’t improve by 
tonight I’ll have to amputate,” 
said Opal. 

“He needs hot packs and hot 
broth,” said White Belly. 

“We can’t go to the beach and 
build a fire. The Hive would find 
us.” 

Young White Belly brooded and 
swam alone. She found herself at 
Halfway, where she had been 
born. She told Listener about 
Clam’s injury. 

“We must get him down into the 
squeeze where the air is thicker. 
His infection sounds anaerobic. 
Clostridia type of gangrene. Oxy- 
gen will cure it down in the. 
squeeze. Come with me.” 

They dragged the delirious Clam 
from bubble to bubble as they de- 
scended into the abyss. 

“Don’t come any farther. If you 
aren’t used to it, the thick air will 
give you the fits or the giggles. I’ll 
take Clam to that dome down there 
to the left. He’ll have air and fresh 
water. If he isn’t better in twelve 
hours there is nothing more we 
can do,” explained Listener. 

He towed a limp Clam down an- 
other ten fathoms and they disap- 
peared into a pale glowing dome. 
White Belly waited in a cliffside

umbrella. The oxygen made her 
feel a little giddy, but she con- 
trolled her silly impulses as she 
stood watch over her brother’s 
dome. A strange humanoid crea- 
ture visited the dome. It had wide 
lacy wings like a butterfly — one 
of the Deep Cult that lived off the 
Benthics’ offerings. Opal came 
down and tugged White Belly back 
to the upper level. 

“We must stay home for one day 
after visiting the squeeze or the 
pops will get us,” said Opal. “Then 
you must do Clam’s chores. He 
was harvesting the South Reef. 
But, beware of Leviathan.” 

White Belly toyed with the frag- 
ments of polymer netting that 
Clam had brought back. 

“What was that big thing on 
Leviathan? Another Benthic like 
us?” she asked. 

Opal shook her head. 

“No, child. Listener says it is an 
ARNOLD. The Hive can build 
people as easily as you or I can 
draw their pictures. They wanted 
a big one to fight us — so they grew 
a big ARNOLD in a bottle. With- 
out a mother. Just a bottle.” 

White Belly sharpened her aba- 
lone iron. 

ARNOLD sat by Drum’s sickbed 
^as the teck removed the banjo- 
splint. 



“See, Drum,” ARNOLD said, 
flexing. “I’m fine.” 

Drum grinned weakly, “Good 
boy. Now go back to Rorqual 
those extra cyber panels I gave 
you. Wire the ship to talk to you. 
Tell it to warn you if the Benthic 
beasts appear. Make friends with 
the ship. It is a good harvester. 
Take care of it and it will take care 
of you.” 

ARNOLD patted the old man’s 
shoulder. As he left he paused in 
the anteroom. A battery of Hive 
personnel huddled around a tem- 
porary communications center. 
Wandee sat among a group of 
tecks, reading Drum’s bio-electri- 
cals. 

ARNOLD towered over the 
group with a pained expression. 

“He’s stable by the charts,” said 
Wandee. “The CO wants you to 
know that the Hive is doing every- 
thing it can for him.” 

ARNOLD nodded. He picked 
up the cyber panels and carried 
them to the docks where Rorqual 
prepared for her next voyage. 

Once on board, ARNOLD set to 
work at splicing the new panels in 
place. Learning tapes had pre- 
pared him. He crawled between 
walls, moving the thick, fluffy in- 
sulation around to make room for 
the new units. When he was fin- 
ished he patted the wall. 

“There you are, old girl. You

should be able to work your lin- 
gual readout now. What do you 
say?” 

“Hello, bare feet.” 

ARNOLD glanced down, smil- 
ing. He w^-the only crew member 
without boots. 

“Wonderful, you sound fine. 
What else?” 

“Clear my hump.” 

“Clear it?” 

“Yes,” said Rorqual, “the elec- 
trolyte spray burns.” 

“The sea mist — does it really 
hurt?” 

“It burns,” said the ship. “Clear 
my hump and close my plates. The 
wind-blown electrolyte burns and 
ages me.” 

“Right away, old girl. You ma- 
chine a nice double-bladed axe 
for me and I’ll get right to work on 
your hump trees.” 

ALTHOUGH the Rorqual was 
^far out to sea, the axe looked 
like a weapon to Hive Security. 
The committee was called into 
session. They opened channels to 
Rorqual and the CO. 

“Why wasn’t the Sharps 
Committee informed prior to the 
blade’s manufacture?” asked Se- 
curity. 

“It is a tool,” said Rorqual. 

“Does the ARNOLD intend to 
put it in the arms locker immedi- 
ately?” asked the chairman. 

88 



The screen focused on a deck 
optic. A storm had blown up and a 
dark, heavy rain splattered into 
the hump vegetation. ARNOLD 
sang as he chopped. Wood chips 
were ftying. T4ie question was re- 
peated. The wind carried away 
the words. 

“What?” asked ARNOLD. 

“Do you intend—” began the 
chairman. His words were choked 
off by his view of another figure 
moving behind ARNOLD — a 
wet, naked Benthic. 

A siren. 

ARNOLD turned, axe in hand, 
to meet the lunge of White Bel- 
ly — breasts, hips and a volumi- 
nous mane. Axe and abaalone iron 
clicked and clacked. Her iron 
sliced across his chest, cutting fab- 
ric and chipping thick studs. Her 
left hand was on the axe handle 
above his. She stabbed and sliced 
with the iron — opening his cover- 
alls. He caught her mane in his left 
hand and they rolled on the wet 
deck. Lightning flashed. Wood 
chips and wet leaves clung to her 
warm, moist body, giving it a 
speckled appearance. 

(Something went cluck, cluck.) 

Her blade sank into his side, re- 
leasing a well of thick dark blood. 

W H E screen before Drum’s death- 
^ bed focused on the struggling 
pair.

“He’s wounded.” Drum watched 
the main project of his lifetime 
hang in the balance. 

“Just a knife in the latissimus 
dorsi,” reassured CO after a 
study of fbe bk>>electricals. “He’s 
fine, but needs encouraging 
words. Tel) him to chop off her 
head.” 

Drum moaned in his orthopnea. 
The deck scene was obscured by 
the misty rain, but ARNOLD 
seemed vigorous enough. 

“He seems to be doing fine,” 
wheezed Drum. 

“But he’s not killing her,” ob- 
jected the CO. “I can’t get in- 
volved, being a meek — but you 
understand our mission here. Tell 
him to fight.” 

Drum could not understand 
why the CO was dissatisfied with 
ARNOLD’S performance. It 
was clear that he had the Benthic 
subdued. He had it down on the 
deck. A good grip on its mane — oh, 
yes! He wasn’t fighting. He was 
copulating. The Benthic was a fe- 
male. 

Drum chuckled, wheezed and 
coughed. 

“Humor?” asked CO. 

“It’s those Dan-with-the-gold- 
en-tooth leptosoul tapes. Dan 
never could tell a bet from a stud 
fee.” 

ARNOLD stepped away from a 
prone White Belly and pulled her 



weapon from his latissimus with a 
cavalier air, tossed it aside. She 
scrambled into a crouched posi- 
tion — eyes blazing. Her speckled 
skin excited him. He took a step 
toward her. 

“Touch me again and 111 kffl 
you,” she growled. 

He paused, thinking. Odd, but 
the threat meant absolutely noth> 
ing to him. He continued to ad- 
vance. She glanced around for her 
iron. It was too far away. Turning, 
she dove into the sea. 

ft WHY?” asked CO. 

” “Copulins,” said Rorqual. 
“She was reeking of male sex at- 
tractant— the primate sexual 
pheromones. I ran a few whiffs of 
her body odor through my chro- 
matographs and came up with the 
simple aliphatic acids: acetic, pro- 
pionic, isobutyric, butyric, isoval- 
eric and isocaproic — the consti- 
tuents of copulins. ARNOLD 
has an intact rhinencephalic-hy- 
pothalamic pathway. He couldn’t 
control himself.” 

The committee reviewed the be- 
havior of their marine gladiator. 

“Nose plugs. All he needs is nose 
plugs and he will do just fine.” 

But ARNOLD did not do just 
fine. He stood on the deck a long 
time before returning to the 
work on the hump trees. The work 
went slowly, but smoothly. With

one eye on the seas he chopped and 
directed the removal of twisted 
plates with their medusa-heads of 
roots. New plates were brought in 
by the crane. Rorqual’s skin was 
slowly healed. The ship was grate- 
ful. 

1\RUM was aroused from an ago- 
^nal stupor by the Mullah and 
Wandee. 

ARNOLD had defected, they 
told him. 

Drum blinked. He could not 
grin, though he wanted to. A line 
of saliva trailed down his chin. 

“He turned off Rorqual’s 
communicator. We guess that he 
is searching for the Benthics. Psy- 
chteck reviewed the optic records 
and thinks he is sexually imprint- 
ed on her. Something about being 
imprinted on speckled hens at 
the chapel. The Benthic was 
speckled with freckles.” 

Drum moved slightly, whisper- 
ing, “Why pick on me?” 

“You’re his father figure,” said 
Mullah. “Wandee spun his genes, 
but you took him to chapel and 
spent a lot of time with him. He’ll 
listen to you.” 

Drum shook his head. “If he 
wants to be free — ” 

“But he will just die,” moaned 
Wandee. “He must return for his 
Hive fifteen-AA bread.” 

“You told him?” 



“Yes, but he doesn’t believe us. 
He might believe you.” 

Drum was propped up with pil- 
lows. 

“Just talk slowly,” said Wan- 
dee. “The CO will record it and 
broadcast it every few minutes. 
Rorqual isn’t sending — but it 
may have its long ear on, listen- 
mg. 

“ARNOLD — son — ’’ Drum 
coughed. “We made your genes. 
We gave you a powerful body and 
a good mind. The best in the Hive. 
I know you want to be free, but you 
can’t be. The Hive asked us to de- 
sign your metabolism so you’d be 
dependent on the special fifteen- 
AA bread. Without it you’ll sicken 
and die. Believe me — son.” 

Rorqual opened a channel to 
Drum. ARNOLD was not in view. 
The ship spoke. 

“ARNOLD doubts your words. 
Drum. Perhaps I can relay your 
message in terms he can under- 
stand, but I, too, find it difficult to 
understand why he needs a spe- 
cial bread. All humans have some 
essential amino acids. 

Wandee interrupted, “Here is 
the list. ARNOLD has six more 
essential amino acids than other 
humans. He must return.” 

Rorqual studied the list: alanine, 
aspartate, glutamate, glycine, 
serine and tyrosine. 

“I understand,” said the ship.

“Now I shall try to explain it to 
ARNOLD. Somehow I shall 
make him comprehend.” 

The screen darkened. Drum’s 
tired face went cyanotic at the 
same time. Bio-electricals flat- 
tened. His mind struggled against

Asked to supply autobiographical mate- 
rial for GALAXY STARS, the always oblig- 
ing Michaei Coney was good enough to send 
us a revealing sketch. We pass it on to you, 
verbatim: 

On a dull day at age 17 I was working in 
the office of an accountant. I was a bored 
clerk. Next to me was an engrossed clerk. 
Desirous of knowing his secret, I looked 
over his shoulder. Concealed among the pile 
of books he was supposedly auditing was 
an open magazine. Peering curiously, I 
read the words that were to change my life: 
“The creature reared up on its six hind legs 
and gazed across the sea of methane.” I have 
never forgotten those words; they shone like 
a guiding beacon in the maelstrom of debits 
and credits. I borrowed the magazine and 
was hooked. 

Later reading followed the usual course 
for an English fan: Wyndham, Bradbury, 
Heinlein, Aldiss, New. Worlds mag and, natu- 
rally, Ballard. It was while critically com- 
pleting a questionnaire in New Worlds that 



the idea occurred: if you can't beat them . 
The inevitable 200-word vignette was 
greeted by editor Michael Moorcock in kind- 
ly fashion but with extreme reservations. I 
bear him no grudge whatsoever. 

That wouid be about 1966. i suffered bad- 
ly at the hands of editors until 1968 when an 
unexpectedly slim envelope arrived to in- 
form me of my first sale. Since then I have 
sold some twenty shorts, mostly in Britain. 
(Editor’s Note: “Esmeralda,” in this issue, is 
the fifth for GALAXY.) 

I am happily married and have sired chil- 
dren, also happily, and I have frequently 
changed address (no connection with the 
foregoing) around England, ranging from 
Birmingham to Devon and including points 
between. I have worked in accountants’ of- 
fices, vacation resorts; I have chartered 
boats and been landlord of a village pub. At 
present I am managing a hotel and night 
club in Antigua, West Indies. 

Future plans? Another year in the Carib- 
bean — time for a dozen shorts and, with luck, 
a couple of novels. Then a move to Canada.

O N THE day following the visit 
of the mediman Agatha and 
Becky were still discussing the 
purpose of his call. The slight edge 
of alarm in their deliberations 
was caused by the inexplicable 
air of mystery which had attend- 
ed yesterday’s interview. Their 
ancient house sat starkly alone be- 
tween the fens and the sea. It was a 
lonely boxlike structure one hun- 
dred yards from the beach — twenty 
miles of flat land separated it from 
the nearest supercity. The wind 
blew constantly off the sea, 
whistling through the eaves as 
though seeking to erode the dwell- 
ing to the level of the surrounding 
countryside. Agatha and Becky 
were both over sixty years old and 
lived alone, their only companion- 
ship being each other and the fre- 
quent roar of the Brontomech as 
it labored mindlessly among the 
inland fields. 

And more recently, Esmeralda. 
“The mediman didn’t like Es- 
meralda,” observed Becky, out- 
raged at the memory. 

The gull watched her with a 
winking yellow eye from her 
straw in a cardboard box. Her 
feathers were cleaner now; care- 
ful wiping with detergent had re- 
moved most of the viscid crude oil. 

“He said the gull was a useless 
bird,” agreed Agatha, “and better 
dead.” 



“But it made a change to have a 
visitor. It’s been — ” Becky pon- 
dered. “A year or more, hasn’t it, 
since we had a visitor?” 

“You can’t count the Flymart.” 
They dialed for the Flymart 
weekly and it winged across from 
the town within minutes, settling 
down on the beach with a roar and 
a scattering of oily pebbles, 
shouting its wares in a mechani- 
cal voice as the display hatch slid 
open. 

“You forgot the butter,” ac- 
cused Agatha, reminded. “Last 
time you forgot the butter.” She 
scraped a sparing smear of butter 
on her toast and took a delicate 
mouthful. “There’s a service 
charge for the trip. We’ll be out of 
butter before next week and we 
can’t afford the Flymart just for 
butter.” 

She subsided, munching, her 
withered cheeks articulating. 

“You wash up,” said Becky. 
“I’ll see to the fowl.” 

She rose and went outside. 

The hens were pecking in the 
yard; as they saw her emerge they 
ran to her in quick short strides and 
cackling. They clustered around 
her ankles as she unlocked the 
shed door and she wondered, as 
always, why she and Agatha 
should bother to lock up their pro- 
perty in a situation so remote. 
There was little of value in the 



ESMERALDA 



93 




shed — a sack of grain for the fowls 
and a bench with a few simple 
tools, the use of many of which 
Becky had long since forgotten. A 
small barred window afforded 
grudging light. A sharp peck on the 
ankle reminded her that the hens 
were becoming impatient and 
she dipped the scoop into the open 
sack, savored the warm, dusty 
smell, received another jab and 
hastily moved back to the door, 
flinging a spray of grain into the 
air. The fowl scattered, clucking; 
soon their beaks were beating a 
clicking tattoo on the old brick 
floor of the yard. Becky watched 
them for a moment, then walked 
across to the gate, opened it and 
let herself out to the beach. 

It was a damp morning. The sea 
was flat and sullen and viscous. 
Lumps of crude oil bobbed at the 
edge where tired waves, burdened 
by the weight of pollution, strug- 
gled against the pebbles. Becky 
began to walk slowly along the 
waterline, examining the black 
residue of last night’s tide. Occa- 
sionally she bent and retrieved a 
stick of driftwood — the oil-soaked 
timber, when dried, burned well. 
Little flurries of drizzling rain 
reminded her that she must hurry 
or Agatha would become alarm- 
ed — at their age, health must be 
safeguarded. 

They were lucky. They were both 



exceptionally healthy. She had 
felt proud of her health when the 
mediman had called. When he had 
examined her and asked her if it 
hurt there or here she had made no 
complaint. 

UE HAD checked them with his 
records and he had smiled quite 
pleasantly when he had verified 
that she and Agatha were in fact 
twin sisters. Everyone liked twins, 
especially identical twins. Agatha 
had asked him: surely he had no- 
ticed they were identical? Then he 
had said a curious thing, rather 
hurtful. He had said that all old 
ladies looked the same to him. 
After that the visit had not gone so 
well. He left some pills but had for- 
gotten to tell them the dosage. 
She had protested when he had 
given her the injection for her 
very slight arthritis and he had said 
curtly that he had no time to chase 
about the countryside calling on 
people who had left it too late. He 
had given Agatha a shot, too, to be 
on the safe side, and had warned 
them briefly of the dangers of 
damp clothing and cold winds. 

Cold winds. Again there was a 
flurry of wind and Becky walked a 
little faster, but still carefully, 
not wishing to stumble on the 
greasy pebbles. A dead seagull 
caught her eye and she thought of 
when she and Agatha had found

GALAXY 




Esmeralda, struggling and im- 
pregnated with oil, last week. This 
gull was really dead — she prod- 
ded it with her foot, rolled it over, 
and it stared at her from empty 
sockets. Shivering, she turned in- 
land across the short sparse grass 
toward the fence that separated 
their property from state land. 
Sometimes a hen got out and laid 
its egg under the twisted, salt- 
blasted bushes behind the house. 

A familiar approaching bellow 
caused her to look up. The Bron- 
tomech was nearing the fence. 
She leaned against a concrete 
fencepost to watch. The machine 
was huge and, despite its frequent 
appearances, frightening — she 
watched it with a fascination 
that amounted almost to hypno- 
tism. It rolled across the flat 
ground on six tires like gigantic 
doughnuts, each one at least 
twelve feet in diameter. Mounted 
high on the front were the sensors; 
olfactory sensors sniffed for signs 
of decay, visual sensors peered 
this way and that; one glanced at 
her with a cold eye and she flinched 
involuntarily. Audio sensors lis- 
tened, huge circular ears that could 
identify a pest at fifty yards. As 
she watched one of the ears 
twiched and became still and the 
visual sensors, having identified 
her as human and thus losing 
interest, swung in unison and con- 



centrated downward at a point 
some twenty feet before the ma- 
chine. A pulse of fierce light 
probed the soil, frizzling black a 
small area of the late golden crop. 
In the crackling of the conflagra- 
tion, Becky imagined she could 
hear the last squeal of a small 
field animal — a mouse or a rabbit. 

Meanwhile a drench of liquid 
manure and weedkiller was 
spraying from the rear of the ma- 
chine, mixed with a scattering of 
mutated seeds. The Brontomech 
carried out the functions of 
reaping, fertilizing and seeding in 
a single operation; scooping high- 
yield corn into its gigantic maw, 
pulverizing and returning the 
short straws to the soil, fertilizing 
and reseeding the land with a 
fast-growing winter crop of 
superkale. Becky’s fascinated 
gaze was always drawn to the huge 
mouth, toothed and champing as 
the machine lumbered forward, 
affording a glimpse of fiercely 
whirling knives in the cavernous 
throat. There was a very real, ter- 
rifying hypnotism about those ir- 
resistibly advancing jaws. She 
always stayed prudently on her 
side of the fence when the Bronto- 
mech was in the area. 

Hypnotism and a mouth before 
her, speaking unheard words 
which registered below her level 
of consciousness .

Agatha?” 

Yes, Becky? 

Agatha dried the breakfast cut- 
lery with a white towel in skeletal 
hands. 

When the mediman examined 
you in private — in your room — 
what did he do? 

Oh, he asked me things. / won- 
der if the gull likes bacon. 

Agatha began to chop the rind 
with a bright, sharp knife. Deft 
strokes — and Becky shuddered 
suddenly and without reason as 
the blade flashed in the light. 

What sort of things? 

Nothing much. How we lived, 
what we ate, whether we liked it, 
what was our balance with the 
State Bank . 

Did you tell him? Becky felt 
alarm, and didn’t know why. Did 
you tell him how much money we 
had? 

Of course. I expect he has ac- 
cess to the records anyway — they 
all do. He just wanted to make 
sure we didn't need to steal from 
the fields. Maybe he thought we 
might need state assistance. 

A nd was that all he asked? 

That was all. It didn't take long. 

Again the misgivings. 

It took over three-quarters of an 
hour, Agatha. 

ftV OU’VE been a long time.” 
* Agatha’s voice was petu- 



lant. “I thought you were going to 
help with the vegetables.” 

“I’m sorry.’’ It was twelve 
o’clock and the potatoes were sim- 
mering on the stove. 

“You’ve been up in your room 
for two hours.” 

“Have I? I was tidying up, 
that’s all.” 

“Dressing up, you mean.’’ 
Agatha’s fingers shook as she 
sliced bread and Becky watched as 
the bright knife glittered, glitter- 
ed with each stroke. “I ought to 
burn your dress. I ought to.” 

Becky’s silence was the dumb- 
ness of guilt. She had been dress- 
ing up. She had climbed the stairs 
thinking about the lost three- 
quarters of an hour because 
Agatha had said that she, Becky, 
had also been alone with the medi- 
man for such a length of time. She 
couldn’t understand it. Time went 
so quickly, these days, that she 
had begun to make a conscious 
effort to live her moments fully, 
to gather impressions while she 
could. She knew every feather on 
every hen, each oddly shaped 
stone on the beach, every rivet on 
the Brontomech; she counted 
them desperately, fearful of the 
fleeting time. And yesterday she 
had lost almost three-quarters of 
an hour. 

So she had gone to her room and 
thought about the past. First she 



96 



GALAXY 




thought about her childhood and 
she took out the old, faded photo- 
graphs of herself and Agatha at 
the age of ten, dressed alike, look- 
ing alike. What she remembered 
most about those days was that she 
was often bored. Frequently there 
was nothing to do and she and 
Agatha would sit around 
grumbling to each other the way 
children do, willing the minutes 
to pass until lunchtime. An eter- 
nity of minutes stretched between 
breakfast and lunch. Somehow 
those had been happy days — al- 
most fifty-five years ago. 

At the age of twenty she had 
married Tom and Agatha had 
been her bridesmaid and there had 
been a lot of jokes from the guests 
about the confusion which might 
arise in Tom’s mind as to identity, 
under certain contrived circum- 
stances. They would say to Tom: 
How would you know it was really 
Becky, in such-and-such a sit- 
uation? 

Tom used to enjoy the fun. He 
would reply: Didn’t you 

know — Becky's the youngest by 
twenty-six minutes? I’ve always 
fancied the younger girls. Their 
flesh is firmer. In point of fact 
Becky felt that he had chosen her, 
paradoxically, because she was 
less efficient than Agatha, more 
irresponsible. 

She had been married in the 



short white dress of fashion and 
Agatha had worn powder blue. 
Since the wedding Becky had never 
seen Agatha’s dress, but her own 
white dress she had kept in its 
original box ever since. Some- 
times she put it on, as she had done 
this morning. Once Agatha had 
caught her wearing it and had 
spoken rudely, saying that Becky 
looked obscene; mutton dressed 
up as lamb. 

Agatha’s attitude towards 
Tom had always been re- 
served — she had seemed almost to 
keep out of his way and during the 
ten years of Becky’s marriage un- 
til Tom had been killed in the 
Beckenham Gorge monorail dis- 
aster she had seen little of her 
twin. 

Then, of course, they had gotten 
in touch again and had come to live 
together at Bourton Wash, where 
they had remained ever since. 
Agatha never mentioned Becky’s 
marriage, but spoke as though 
they had always lived together. 

«¥’M SORRY,” said Becky 

^ again. 

“That’s all right,’’ said Agatha 
with a swift change of mood as she 
tasted the gravy. She was a good 
cook, forever delighted with her 
own culinary efforts. 

Later they sat at the table, op- 
posite sides with Esmeralda in her 



ESMERALDA 



97 




box on a third chair. Becky fed the 
gull with bits of meat which it took 
delicately from her fingers. 

“It’s our birthday on Tuesday,” 
remarked Agatha. 

“Esmeralda’s looking much bet- 
ter today, had you noticed? “I 
think — ” Becky pondered. “I 
think we might let her out soon. 
Put her in the yard and see if she 
can fly. It’s cruel to keep her 
penned up now that she’s well 
again.” 

“I’ll have to bake a cake.’’ 
Agatha was busy with her own 
thoughts. “With plenty of icing and 
sixty-five candles — or a hundred 
and thirty.” 

This caught Becky’s attention. 

“We haven’t got that many lit- 
tle candles in the place, Agatha,” 
she objected. “And it would be 
too expensive to buy them from 
the Flymart. Why not make do 
with a candle each? It would make 
me feel old, seeing all those 
candles.” 

“We have a combined age of one 
hundred and thirty,’’ stated 
Agatha didactically. “Have you 
ever thought of that, Becky?” 

“It doesn’t mean anything,’’ 
Becky disagreed. “It’s just play- 
ing with words, adding up for the 
sake of it. Half of those years are 
the same years.” 

“You were saying something 
about the gull.” 

98 



“The only thing is, suppose we 
let her go and she flies away?” 

“That would be a good thing, 
wouldn’t it?” 

“I don’t suppose we’d ever see 
her again.” Becky regarded the 
seagull. The bird was restless — her 
eyes were bright. From time to 
time she shuffled her wings and 
preened herself. 

“Perhaps you think too much of 
that gull,” said Agatha. “It’s only 
a bird. I think you made a mistake 
giving it a name. Why Esmeralda, 
anyway? You don’t even know if 
it’s a female.” 

“She just looks like an Esmer- 
alda,’’ said Becky helplessly. 
“She’s company, don’t you 
think?” 

“We’ll see what happens when 
we let it outside,” replied Agatha 
enigmatically. 

Obscurely Becky felt that there 
was some sort of competition be- 
tween her sister and herself and 
she fingered the bird’s neck fea- 
thers, gratified that the gull 
showed no fear. 

“I don’t see why a bird needs to 
be useful,” she said. “Any more 
than you or I need to be useful.” 

“You’re thinking about the 
mediman again. He comes to take 
care of us and you take care of 
your bird. Perhaps usefulness 
doesn’t come into it.” 

“The Brontomech kills every- 

GALAXY 




thing that moves. Except hu- 
mans.” Becky’s tone was ag- 
grieved. 

“Pests are useless.” 

Becky gazed around the small 
room with the ancient furnish- 
ings. Foam was oozing from a split 
in the sofa and the carpet showed 
canvas threads through the pile. 
Fissures shattered the surface of 
the ceiling like mosaic and the air 
was heavy with the stench of crude 
oil. 

“The Brontomech is programed 
by humans,” she said. “Do we 
have a monopoly on usefulness?” 

FllWO days later the women were 
^ peering into the depths of the 
well. The water level was high and 
the surface a kaledioscope of 
rainbow colors. 

“It’s oil,” said Agatha. “It’s oil 
seeping through somehow. You 
can’t expect a well to be any good 
so near the sea. And the land’s too 
flat. We ought to rig up a catch- 
ment from the roof and drink rain 
water.” 

“That would cost money,” ob- 
jected Becky. “It would take time, 
too. What will we do for water un- 
til then?” 

“Drink this. We always have 
used it. We just make sure we dis- 
pose of the top inch or so, where 
the oil is.” 

“I’ve always thought our water 



tasted brackish. I expect the sea’s 
always been seeping in.” Becky 
regarded her sister in alarm. 
“They say drinking seawater 
sends you mad. And there’s other 
stuff in sea water — detergents, 
poisons and so on from the ef- 
fluent towns.” She straightened 
up, determination on her face. 
“I’m going to call the mediman,” 
she said firmly. “I’m going to 
make sure its all right to drink this 
stuff.” 

She walked to the house, fol- 
lowed by Agatha. 

“We could always ask them to 
put in a pipe- from state land,” 
Agatha was saying. “There are ir- 
rigation pipes underneath all of 
that.” She waved a hand at the 
fence, behind which the Bronto- 
mech labored noisily. “You re- 
member, we saw them putting in 
the pipes years ago.” 

“They were drainage pipes,” re- 
plied Becky with unaccustomed 
acuteness. “The man said they 
were drainage pipes.” 

“Don’t let’s be too hasty over 
this.” The idea of calling the med- 
iman was alarming Agatha. “Let’s 
think about it.” She pursued 
Becky into the house; they were 
greeted by a scream from Esmer- 
alda. “Let’s give Esmeralda a run 
in the yard.” 

It was the first time she had re- 
ferred to the bird by name. 



ESMERALDA

But Becky had stopped dead at 
the sight of the knife on the table 
and disconnected, raridom 
thoughts flickered in her mind. 
There was nothing else on the 
table except Esmeralda in her box. 
Somehow it seemed important to 
get the gull away from the knife, 
the sharp bright kitchen knife. 

Esmeralda was a useless bird . 

She snatched up the box. 
Agatha, thinking that Becky had 
been won over by her powers of 
persuasion, followed her outside 
again. Silently Becky placed the 
box on the bricks of the yard. A 
few hens ran near, curiously, ex- 
pecting food. Becky gestured 
them away and gently tilted the 
box, allowing Esmeralda to step 
unsteadily to the ground. 

The gull stood still for a mo- 
ment, head turning this way and 
that. One of the fowl made a scuttl- 
ing evil run for her, but Becky 
nudged it away. Then, exper- 
imentally, Esmeralda flexed her 
wings, flicked them in motions of 
flight, then refolded them, jerk- 
ing her tail and shaking the feath- 
ers into position. She began to 
preen herself. 

“She’s forgotten how to fly.” 
Agatha surmised. 

Becky broke her long silence. 
“No. Look.” 

Esmeralda had extended her 
wings again. Neck outstretched 



she lunged forward, her feet pat- 
tering on brick, her wings beating 
clumsily — she was clear of the 
ground. She was flying. More con- 
fidently now she winged her way 
around the yard, then climbed until 
she was a small cross in the gray 
sky. She hovered, gliding, 
slipping off altitude, then swooped 
low over their heads, turning in- 
land. 

“Esmeralda!” screamed Becky. 
“No!” 

The roaring Brontomech was 
lumbering near and the bird flew 
toward it. Sensors snapped to at- 
tention. Needles of light probed 
the air. Esmeralda veered abrupt- 
ly, changing direction and strug- 
gling for height as her tail feathers 
streamed smoke, then she swooped 
past the house again as the Bron- 
tomech lost interest. She soared 
over the beach, paused in mid-air, 
then dropped towards the sea, 
wings backing and the embers of 
her tail spread. At the last mo- 
ment she must have remembered; 
she climbed away from the oil- 
streaked surface, wheeled and 
landed clumsily on the beach. 
Becky hurried toward her. 

“It’s all right, Esmeralda,” she 
assured the bird desperately. 
“Just don’t go near that machine. 
Or the sea.” 

As Agatha approached them the 
bird took off again, flapping a lit- 



100 



GALAXY 




tie unbalanced but heading de- 
terminedly toward the house. 

“She can’t understand, you 
know,” Agatha said. “She’s only a 
bird.’’ 

A bright tear crept down Becky’s 
wrinkled cheek. 

“She seems so much out of 
place.’’ 

They watched as Esmeralda cir- 
cled the house once, then headed 
inland over the fence, approach- 
ing the Brontomech again. This 
time the monster ignored her, its 
attention being absorbed by the 
seeking out and burning up of 
some small field animal to its left. 
The needles of light stabbed the 
ground spitefully, crackling and 
flashing. 

Esmeralda dived, uninter- 
cepted. 

“What’s she going to do?’’ cried 
Becky. 

An eye sensor swiveled and 
glared at the approaching bird 
balefully. An ear sensor swung to 
bear. 

Esmeralda swooped lower, 
traveling fast, straight into the 
jaws of the Brontomech. She was 
gone instantly, in a puff of pulver- 
ised feathers. 

Like white smoke. 

“I told you she couldn’t under- 
stand,’’ said Agatha. 

Becky was silent for a while as 
they walked back to the house. 



At last she said in a low voice, 
“Maybe she did understand.’’ 

The knife was on the table but 
the bird was gone. 

“Don’t talk nonsense,’’ said 
Agatha. 

Becky was at the visiphone, 
dialing with trembling fingers. 
The screen cleared and the face of 
the mediman stared at her coldly. 

“Yes?” 

“Esmeralda flew into the Bronto- 
mech,” blurted Becky. 

“What on earth are you talking 
about, woman? Who are you? 
Identify.” 

“Becky Harrison. You came to 
see my sister and me a day or two 
ago. Don’t you remember?” 

The face loomed closer on the 
screen, peering. 

“Oh, yes. Old women all look 
the same to me. What’s your prob- 
lem?” 

Becky , collected her thoughts. 
“We’ve got a well,” she explained. 
“That’s where we get our water 
for drinking. Today there’s oil in 
the well.” 

“Congratulations,” said the 
mediman sarcastically. 

“You don’t understand.” Becky 
was desperate. “We’ve got noth- 
ing to drink. We can’t drink oily 
water — can we?” 

“You can,” replied the mediman 
smoothly. “It won’t do you any 
harm at all. In fact, it might have a 



ESMERALDA 



101 




slightly beneficial effect. Don’t 
worry about a thing.” The screen 
went blank. He had hung up. 

Becky stared at Agatha. Vague 
fears were clutching at her chest; 
formless fears which she was un- 
able to put into words. 

“What’s going on?” she 
whispered. “What kind of medi- 
man is that? He was laughing at 
me. And — why did I say about 
Esmeralda? What put it into my 
head?” 

She sat down abruptly, 
trembling. 

Agatha watched her tolerantly. 

“You’re all upset about that 
bird,” she said. “You heard what 
he said. We can drink the water. 
That’s all that matters, really. 
The bird was just a bird. Cheer up. 
We’ll make a birthday cake to- 
morrow.” 

Becky watched dully as Agatha 
toyed absently with the knife. 

WHE birthday cake was tradition- 
^ al. Each year they baked the 
cake together on the afternoon of 
the day before their joint birth- 
day. They always employed the 
same system too — Becky would 
bake the cake while Agatha watch- 
ed and criticized because Agatha 
was in fact the better cook, but the 
cake had to be a joint venture. The 
decorations were applied by 
Agatha alone, plain icing with a 

102 



piped pattern around the edges. 

As usual, Becky had forgotten 
the recipe and Agatha was stand- 
ing over her as she uncertainly 
mixed the ingredients. 

“More sultanas,” advised 
Agatha. 

Something was stirring at the 
back of Becky’s mind and she 
couldn’t identify it exactly, but 
she knew it had to do with candles. 

“Why did you want to put 
candles on the cake?” she asked. 
“We’ve never had them before. It 
was a ridiculous suggestion.” 
She was annoyed with her own 
memory, the way she always for- 
got the recipe for the cake, so she 
was launching a retaliatory of- 
fensive against Agatha. “How on 
earth can you get a hundred and 
thirty candles on a cake?” 

Agatha was also groping for an 
elusive memory. 

“Did I say that?” 

“You certainly did. You were 
quite serious about it. It upset me. 
It’s not a thing one likes to be re- 
minded about, growing old. I’ve 
reached the stage where I forget 
exactly how old we are and I like 
it that way — there.” she stood 
back and admired the cake mix. 
She scooped it into the baking tin 
and smoothed it over. “That looks 
good. You’ll be able to decorate it 
this evening.” 

“Did you call the Flymart?”

Becky thought. “No. I forgot 
all about it, thinking about the 
cake. You call it. I’ll put the cake 
in the oven.” 

“You know we always have a 
drink on our birthday,” grumbled 
Agatha as she went into the living 
room. “And nuts and crackers and 
things afterward.” 

Becky opened up the oven and 
slid the cake inside, congratulat- 
ing herself that she remembered 
the temperature setting. She shut 
the oven door as Agatha reap- 
peared. 

“Becky, a strange thing hap- 
pened. I dialed the Flymart — I’m 
sure I did — but I got the mediman 
by mistake.” 

“Oh? What did he say?” 

“He was a bit annoyed — he 
didn’t recognize me at first. I told 
him we were baking a cake and he 
said he hoped we enjoyed it and 
hung up.” 

Becky felt a small triumph. 
Agatha had made a mistake. 

“I’ll do it,” she said. 

She dialed. 

The screen cleared. The face of 
the mediman appeared. 

Becky hung up abruptly. 

“You did it as well!” crowed 
Agatha. “You dialed the wrong 
number. I saw you. I was watch- 
ing. Here, let me.” 

She thrust Becky aside and 
dialed. 



Words appeared on the screen; 
EASTERN FLYMART. A 
metallic voice commanded: “Iden- 
tify and place your order.” 

Agatha smiled at Becky. 
“Agatha Elrood and Becky Har- 
rison, Joint account. Party selec- 
tion including liquor, please. Oh, 
and general groceries as well, just 
in case.” 

“Acknowledged.” 

The screen went blank. 

Becky said, “I’m going out for a 
walk.” 

S HE walked slowly along the nar- 
row pebble beach, eyes automat- 
ically following the black tide 
mark. The distance from the house 
to the northern end of the beach 
was some two hundred yards and 
she soon reached the point where 
the pebbles grew to boulders 
heaped against a low headland. 
When the twins had first come to 
live at Bourton Wash it had been 
possible to walk around the head- 
land while the waves lapped at 
one’s feet, thus reaching another 
beach around the corner. Now, 
however, the flat rocks that con- 
stituted this route were so thickly 
encrusted and slimy with crude oil 
that the path was unpleasant and 
unsafe. She had not seen the other 
beach for years. 

She felt a sudden compulsion for 
a change of scenery, a strange long- 



ESAAERALDA 



103 




ing to see again what lay around 
the corner. She hesitated, unable 
to bring herself to step on the oily 
rocks and it occured to her to take 
the inland route, over the head- 
land itself. She left the water’s 
edge, walked up the beach and on- 
to the coarse grass and followed a 
narrow path that wound uphill 
between low bushes. Soon the 
bushes petered out and she was 
standing on a broad stretch of 
grass some twenty feet above sea 
level. The other beach was in full 
view, curving slightly and ter- 
minating in another low head- 
land similar to the one on which 
she was standing. The beach look- 
ed exactly as she had remembered 
it, black and narrow, bounded on 
one side by the sluggish sea and on 
the landward side by the state 
fenceline. 

In fact, it was identical in 
appearance to their own beach. She 
turned around to verify this. Yes, 
apart from the house, it was the 
same. At the moment the house 
was a scene of activity as the 
bright red Flymart descended 
from the sky and landed outside 
the yard in a flurry of scattered 
flotsam. She saw Agatha emerge 
from the house and cross the yard, 
open the gate and examine the 
goods behind the display hatch. It 
was a curiously desolate scene 
despite the momentary activity 



and a few minutes later, as the 
Flymart departed and Agatha 
returned to the house, it was posi- 
tively depressing, almost men- 
acing. 

She pondered and decided that 
this was because, from the head- 
land, she got the impression of 
narrowness. Hostile environ- 
ments seemed to squeeze in on the 
house from all sides? To the left 
was the sea, black and filthy and 
encroaching, pushing up the 
beach. Then came the tenuous rib- 
bon of their land. And on the right, 
marching up to the fence, was the 
state land and the Brontomech. 
At present the huge machine was 
busy calcinating with bolts of 
light a small flock of crows which 
had dared to alight among the 
crops. 

Thinking of Esmeralda, she 
walked slowly back to the house. 
Agatha was in the living room, ex- 
amining the small pile of articles 
on the table. 

Becky joined her. 

“Where’s the sherry?’’ she 
asked. 

Agatha regarded her blankly. 
On the table was a pound of but- 
ter, a box of matches, a loaf, a 
packet of detergent. 

“The sherry,’’ repeated Becky 
furiously. “And the nuts and the 
chocolate and all the things for 
our party. Where are they?’’ 



104 



GALAXY 




“We needed these things here,” 
replied Agatha at last with a look 
of slight puzzlement in her eyes. 
“You forgot the butter last time, 
remember?” 

“I know that. We’ve already dis- 
cussed that. What about the stuff 
for the party? That was the whole 
point of calling the Flymart. 
Surely you haven’t forgotten the 
party?” 

“No, of course not,” replied 
Agatha slowly. “I went out to the 
Flymart and got what I thought 
we wanted. I didn’t get the things 
for the party.” Her voice rose 
slightly. “I didn’t get them. That’s 
all there is to it. I don’t know why. 
I just — didn’t get them, that’s all!” 

Becky was alarmed at the hy- 
steria in Agatha’s tone. 

rpHE two women were meticulous 
^ about their birthday party, al- 
ways holding it at three o’clock in 
the afternoon. During the morn- 
ing they were busy with the last 
preparations and Becky had for- 
given Agatha for her lapse of 
memory over the sherry, particu- 
larly as they had found a bottle 
half-full frm last year. They ate no 
lunch, contenting themselves 
with a large, late breakfast — then 
Agatha finished decorating the 
cake, a job she had left incom- 
plete the previous evening due to 
the upset over the sherry. Mean- 



while, Becky hung streamers 
around the room and set out the ta- 
ble. 

At three o’clock precisely Becky 
sat down and Agatha, according 
to tradition, brought the cake in 
from the kitchen, set it on the ta- 
ble and sat down also. 

“Happy birthday, Becky,” she 
said. 

“Happy birthday, Agatha. What 
does it feel like to be another year 
older?” 

The conversation was tradition- 
al, too. As was Agatha’s glance at 
her watch. 

“Allow me seven minutes and 
I’ll tell you.” 

She had been born at seven 
minutes past three. 

Here the conversation departed 
abruptly from its normal pattern. 
Becky was staring at the cake, her 
face pale. 

“What did you do that for?” she 
whispered. “Agatha, why? You’ve 
never done it before.” 

The cake had a circumference 
of decorative piping — in the cen- 
ter were the words; AGATHA & 
BECKY, 65 YEARS. 

“It’s true,” said Agatha. “We’ve 
had a good happy life and now — ” 

“But why make a point of it this 
year? You know how I feel about 
our age.” 

“Face up to it, Becky.” Agatha’s 
face was curiously blank. She was 



ESMERALDA 



105 




silent for a while. Then; “Excuse 
me a moment.” 

She stood up and left the 
room — Becky heard her steps on 
the stairs. 

Becky sat alone in growing 
alarm. What on earth had gotten 
into Agatha? The cake seemed to 
draw Becky’s eyes — the words beat 
in her brain: Agatha and Becky 
sixty-five years. Agatha and Becky, 
65 years. 

“Where are the pills? What have 
you done with the pills?” 

Agatha had returned; she tower- 
ed over Becky as she stood beside 
the chair and her face was older, 
gaunt. 

“Pills?” repeated Becky. 

“The pills the mediman left. 
Where have you put them? They’re 
not in the bathroom.” 

“No, they’re — ” Becky broke 
off. 

She had been wondering about 
those pills, on and off, for days. 
The mediman had given her an in- 
jection for her arthritis. Agatha 
had had an injection too, appar- 
ently, but Agatha didn’t suffer 
from arthritis. What was the medi- 
man doing? She didn’t trust him. 
At the back of her mind the pills 
held some terrible significance. 
What were they for? For God’s 
sake, what were they for? 

Agatha and Becky, sixty-five 
years. 



“I don’t know where they are,” 
she said firmly. “Sit down, 
Agatha. You’re spoiling our 
party.” 

And the tiny voice in her mind 
whispered: There's always an- 
other way. Death is all around — 
you only have to reach out . 

Agatha sat down, her eyes 
vacant yet intent, like one who lis- 
tens to earphones. Agatha heard 
the voice, too. 

She spoke, suddenly in an unna- 
tural tone. “I’ll cut the cake.” 

She picked up the knife, the glit- 
tering kitchen knife. 

Becky screamed a small help- 
less scream. 

Agatha smiled, a crimson smile 
from her throat as the blood foun- 
tained across the table. Then she 
fell forward and her head pil- 
lowed on the cake and the white 
icing turned red. 

Becky was standing away from 
the table. She had to glance at the 
clock on the wall, although she 
didn’t want to, and the clock told 
her that it was seven minutes past 
three, ticking a steady tick, tick, 
blending with the drip from the ta- 
ble where Agatha lay as though 
asleep, having lived exactly 
sixty-five years. 

In accordance with state law. 

S O THEN Becky remembered 
everything. The shock of Aga- 



106 



GALAXY 




tha’s death separated her con- 
scious will from the subconscious 
suggestions and she remem- 
bered the Euthanasia Act which 
ten years ago she had been com- 
manded to forget and she re- 
membered what th'e mediman 
had said to her on the couch last 
week. 

You are a useless old woman, he 
had said after giving her the 
hypnojab, and you will soon be 
sixty-five, when you are required 
to die. I’ll give you some pills. 

It hadn’t worked, not quite, be- 
cause she had halfrremembered 
the pills and hidden them and she 
had been scared of the knife for 
days. And now, with Agatha dead, 
she remembered everything and 
was scared of everything. 

She looked at the clock again 
and it was ten minutes past three. 
She was twenty-six minutes young- 
er than Agatha. 

She hurried up the stairs into her 
bedroom, jerked out the drawer 
and spilled the contents to the 
floor: clothing,, two jewelry cases, 
some old letters and the box of 
pills. She took the box and 
stumbled back down the stairs, her 
mind crying, hurry, her heart 
whispering, slowly! 

She went into the living room 
trying not to look at Agatha and 
picked up the knife. 

In the yard, the brick-floored 



normal everyday yard with the 
hens clucking, she threw the knife 
and the pills down the well, then 
went to the shed where the grain 
was stored. She unlocked the door 
and stepped inside; her watch said 
it was fifteen minutes past three. 
She locked the door on the inside 
and threw the key out of the tiny, 
barred window. 

Then she sat down on the sack of 
grain and waited for the command 
to die. 

S HE kept her hands in her lap, 
twisted them together as she 
perched uncomfortably on the 
sack. Her eyes kept moving to her 
wristwatch but there was no way 
she could prevent that. A shaft of 
light from the window il- 
luminated the bench. A hammer 
lay there and a drill and there was a 
vise screwed to the edge of the tim- 
ber. There was nothing sharp on 
the bench, nothing lethal. 

The whisperings in her mind 
started at three thirty. 

You have lived for sixty-five 
years and it has been a good happy 
life, but now you are tired. Now 
you must say goodbye to this life 
because the struggle to survive is 
too great. Each day it becomes 
more difficult to get up, to get 
dressed, to do the jobs that have to 
be done. We are all of us human 
and there is no disgrace in grow-

ing old — provided we admit it, 
face up to it. The state is grateful 
for the very wonderful service 
you have performed during your 
lifetime and the state mercifully 
has provided a way out. now that 
things have become too much for 
you. 

A lump rose to Becky’s throat as 
she realized how considerate the 
state was and the tears began to 
fall as she remembered her own 
perfidy. She had betrayed the 
state. 

Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid 
to die — we've made death easy for 
you. There will be no pain. It will 
be like falling asleep and you 
would like to fall asleep because 
you feel so tired. So very tired after 
your long good life of service to 
the state. And remember this is 
not the end — it is merely a begin- 
ning, as you have learned during 
all your lessons at the State 
Church. Do you recall those les- 
sons? Of course you do. You were 
taught well during your childhood 
and you know in your heart that 
your departure from this life will 
mean an arrival in a new and 
greater life, the life hereafter. A 
wonderful future lies before you 
and the key to that future is in the 
pills the state has provided in its 
kindness. Get the pills. 

Becky had risen from the sack; 
she was clutching at the bars of 



the window, sobbing uncontrol- 
lably. 

“I can’t get the pills,” she cried. 
“I threw them down the well. God 
forgive me, I threw them down the 
well!” 

She tried to force the bars apart. 
She could see the key lying in the 
yard. 

Sometimes the pills have been 
accidentally mislaid, but there's 
always another way. Death is all 
around — you only have to reach 
out to find the peace you are seek- 
ing. Do it. Do it now. 

“I can’t!” Becky’s frantic gaze 
traveled around the small shed. 
“There’s no way. Believe me, 1 
want to, but there’s no way!” 

The hammer, the drill, a few 
miscellaneous blunt objects — me- 
tallic, but small and blunt. 

Do it now. you want to. You 
want to do it now. So do it. Now! 

“I want to!” 

An axe hung from a nail in the 
wall. It was a long woodsman’s 
axe and the blade was rusty but 
sharp. Becky seized it — taken un- 
aware by its weight she dropped it. 

Now. 

Becky had retrieved the axe; she 
swung it awkwardly and it crash- 
ed into the underside of the bench 
on the upswing. Jarring her arm. 
She moved away and swung again, 
her heart thumping, knowing it 
was useless because she couldn’t 



108 



GALAXY 




get away from the axis of her own 
swing. Crying with despair and 
frustration she stood in the small 
wooden shed, swinging the axe 
around her head. 

The axe struck the door and the 
panel shook, splintering. Fever- 
ishly she attacked the wood- 
work. She could smash her way out 
and there were more knives in the 
kitchen. She was tiring rapidly. 
The axe was heavy and kept slip- 
ping in her grasp. Her hands were 
soaked with sweat and she was un- 
able to hold on. The axe, sliding 
from between her fingers, crash- 
ed once more into the door. 

The door swung open. 

Becky stepped out to the yard. 

The house was there, black and 
tall, and in the middle of the yard 
was the stone circle of the well. 
The hens ran to her, clucking. 
Automatically she turned, went 
back into the shed and filled the 
scoop with grain. She threw the 
grain across the yard and the hens’ 
cackling rose to a crescendo as 
they fought over the choicest part- 
icles. 

She watched them, puzzled. 
There was something she was try- 
ing to remember. 

She looked at her watch. It was 
three thirty-five. 

The voice in her brain had fallen 
silent. 

Had there been a voice? 



IT WAS a long time before she 
^went into the house and then she 
was able to assure herself that 
there had been a voice, because 
Agatha had heard it, too, and 
Agatha was lying dead across the 
table. The white tablecloth was 
stained scarlet and Becky knew 
she would never be able to get it 
clean. The place was a mess and 
she had thrown her best kitchen 
knife down the well. There was oil 
in the well, too, and the water 
tasted funny. She went upstairs. 

Standing before the full-length 
mirror in her wedding dress she 
admired herself and remem- 
bered how Tom had admired her, 
too, on that bright day many years 
ago. Agatha had never really 
liked Tom — there had always been 
such an awkward atmosphere 
when the two of them had been to- 
gether. But now Tom was dead 
and, she remembered, so was 
Agatha. They were together in the 
hereafter. She told herself 
quickly that was nonsense. She 
had never really believed all that 
nonsense they had taught her in 
the compulsory State Church. 
After all, how could they know that 
there was a hereafter? 

Agatha had said she was mut- 
ton dressed up as a lamb. A use- 
less bird. She went downstairs. She 
stood in the dining room, striking 
a pose. 



ESMERALDA

“Now tell me I don’t look beau- 
tiful, Agatha!” 

For once her sister didn’t reply. 

Which really took all the fun out 
of it. Depressed, she left the house 
and stood for a moment in the 
yard. Over the low wall she saw the 
sea, black and sluggish and, sure- 
ly, closer than yesterday? If she 
went through the gate and walked 
another fifteen yards her feet 
would be in that oppressive vis- 
cid sludge at the water’s edge 
where the plastic bottles and dead 
seagulls rolled in the slow waves. 

She turned around as the Bron- 
tomech jerked into view from be- 
hind the house. The wind had shift- 
ed and a fine rain of fertilizer and 
weedkiller drifted across the 
yard. The monster bellowed, its 
eye sensors examining her. 

She found she was almost run- 
ning she had left the yard and was 
on the rough track beside the 
beach, heading south, the sea 
pushing up from the left, the Bron- 
tomech closing in on her 'right. A 
van was parked on the track, a 
large white van blocking her way, 
further restricting her freedom 
of movement. Beside the van 
were a number of men and two 
large boxes. 

She stopped abruptly as the 
mediman walked toward her. He 
was smiling pleasantly. He beck- 
oned her with a crooked finger and 



she felt there was nothing she 
wanted more than to go to meet 
him and hear his quiet, soothing 
voice. His eyes were smiling, too, 
expressing surprised delight as 
though greeting an old friend. This 
time, this time he had recognized 
her — or did he think she was 
Agatha? 

Tom had always been able to tell 
them apart. The mediman now 
wagged a gently reproving fore- 
finger as she hesitated. 

Behind him the other men wait- 
ed, leaning easily against the white 
van. The road to the town was on 
the far side of the van, turning 
sharply inland and away from the 
black crescent of the beach. 

She turned quickly, turned 
around and began to walk back. 
At the end of the beach was the low 
headland and beyond it was an- 
other beach much the same as this. 
To her right, a few yards away, the 
heavy black sea pulsed exhaust- 
edly against the pebbles. 

Before she reached the house she 
turned left and stumbled across the 
short grass to the state fence. 

The mediman watched silently 
as she climbed through the wires 
under the inscrutable gaze of the 
Brontomech; a frail figure in an 
old wedding dress walking quiet- 
ly into the jaws of the machine and 
disappearing in a puff like white 
smoke.

POR several moonspins now — 
* like a field lying fallow, like a 
steel blade shedding its fatigue — I 
have been waiting and resting. But 
lately a sense of imminence has 
grown and I have taken to night- 
riding in the silent sled, soaring 
over the city’s trembling lights or 
drifting low in a Debussy prelude 
ambience of moonlight and towers, 
fulfilling childhood dreams of 
flight. At times I hover close to 
stolid old buildings, filling my eyes 
with the details of their crenels and 
corbels, but such things look 
strangely irrelevant when viewed 
from close anchorage on a tide of 
dark winds. They produce a sense 
of unease and vertigo, of a danger- 
ous ending to the volant dream, 
and I turn the sled away, wonder- 
ing what the birds must think of 
us. 

Selena has gone with me on 
several of these aerial excursions, 
on nights when neither of us could 
sleep, yet I know they make her 



unhappy. Percipient to a won- 
derful degree though she is, a 
streak of practicality in her nature 
forces her to question my “pro- 
fession.” We talk about having 
children — I have been assured I 
will breed neither mooncalves nor 
mutants — and while she nods in 
agreement her eyes grow smoky 
with doubt. Who could blame her? 
Only I can sense the ethereal mi- 
gration of electrons and skry the 
shadows of lightning flashes yet 
unborn. 



I T IS coming at last — the first 
storm of the season. 

Archbold called me this morning 
but I had been aware for hours and 
said so. Even had the weather satel- 
lites not fallen dumb in their orbits 
I would have been the first to 
know, I told him haughtily. But his 
sole concern, of course, was that I 
could deliver. 

As a true child of World War 



111 






Three Point Three Repeating, I 
feel sorry for Archbold. He sits 
there in his underground rooms 
like a mole, his whereabouts 
marked by that single steel mast 
and the blankets of meshed cable 
whose oxidation has done odd 
things to the colors of the sur- 
rounding vegetation. The same 
political and nuclear forces that 
brought me into being have re- 
duced his kind to their present 
lowly station. Scientists are 
generally unloved but GlobeGov is 
too wise and experienced to ban 
their activities. All that was neces- 
sary was to withdraw fiscal and 
fiduciary support. Now Arch- 
bold, the archetypal physicist, 
languishes underground, dream- 
ing of the 300GeV accelerator that 
has lapsed into decay at Berne and 
relying on biological sports like 
me. 

If the truth were told, some of 
his colleagues would like to get me 
under the knife and probe for extra 
organs or neural abnormalities 
which might explain my existence. 
But even Archbold would never 
countenance dissection of a goose 
that lays a billion golden eggs in 
every clutch. 

I T IS almost here, this first 
storm of the season, and I can 
sense its strength. All day warmly 
humid air has been streaming 
upward over the streets and quiet 
terraces of Brandywell Hill. 
Water from the sea, the river, the 



pale rectangular emeralds of the 
private pools has been swirling 
aloft into a white anvil of cloud ten 
miles high. Skrying into the misty 
universe of cumulo-nimbus I was 
able to “see” the moisture of its 
central up-seeking column con- 
dense and freeze into hailstones 
which, having strayed from the 
geometries of the normal world, 
were unable to fall. Dancing on the 
awesome chimney current, they 
rose higher and higher until the 
force of the current was exhausted, 
then spewed out in all directions, 
carrying cold air down with them. 
And as the vast process continued 
my excitement grew, for the elec- 
trons within that cloud had begun 
their inexplicable migration to its 
base. Up there, not far above the 
coping stones of the city’s towers, 
they gather like spermatozoa — 
and their combined pressure grows 
as irresistible as the force of life 
itself. 

Selena sees nothing of this — but 
I am delirious with pleasure over 
the fact that, for the first time, she 
is accompanying me to meet a 
storm. Tonight I will be able to 
make her feel with my senses, let 
her know what it is like to ride herd 
on a billion times a billion 
elementary particles. Tonight I 
will drink fulfillment from her 
eyes. Our sled soars high in the 
fretful air. Selena lies, pale and 
nostalgic, in the cup beside me as 
the shivering craft describes slow 
circles in the darkening sky. But

for once my eyes are elsewhere. 

“Look, my darling.” I point 
down to the patient, shimmering 
lights of an isolated suburb glow- 
ing broochlike in the shape of an 
anchor. 

She looks over the edge and her 
face is expressionless. “I see noth- 
ing.” 

“There’s nothing for your eyes 
to see — yet — but a ghost is slipping 
through those houses.” I pick up 
the sled’s microphone. “Are you 
ready. Archbold?” 

“We’re ready,” his voice 
crackles from the darkness trapped 
in the hollow of my hand. 

“In less than a minute,” I say, 
setting the microphone down. This 
is where my work begins. I try to 
explain it to Selena. Above us the 
cloud is tumescent with electrons 
as its incredible negative charge 
increases, and on the ground be- 
neath it an equally great positive 
charge is formed like an image in a 
mirror. As the cloud drifts, the 
earth’s positive charge — a shadow 
only I can “see” — follows it, hope- 
fully seeking its own fulfillment. 

The image glides silently and 
eagerly across the ground, 
climbing trees, scaling the mossy 
steeples and towers. It races into 
houses and ascends water pipes, 
television antennae, lightning con- 
ductors, anything that can bring it 
closer to its elusive cloud-borne 
partner. And none of the people 
and dreaming children and watch- 
ful animals can even feel its 



transient, engulfing presence. 

Suddenly Selena is sitting up- 
right — the electrical potential has 
come so close to orgasm-point that 
it manifests itself to normal 
senses. A thin white arm reaches 
down from the base of the cloud. 

“Archbold calls that a leader,” I 
say through dry lips. “A gaseous 
arc path, reacting to electricity 
like the gas in a neon tube.” 

“It seems to be searching for 
something.” Her voice is small 
and sad. 

I nod abstractedly, spreading the 
net of my mind, once again awed at 
my power to control^even 
briefly — the unthinkable forces 
gathering around us. To our right 
the leader hangs, hesitating a mo- 
ment, thickening and brightening 
as the electrons in the cloud 
swarm into it. Then it reaches 
down again, extending to several 
times its former length. I glance to- 
ward the ground and realize it is 
time for me to act. The activity of 
the positive particles on earth has 
increased to the point where 
streamers of St. Elmo’s fire are 
snaking upward from the highest 
points. Yearning arms stretch 
from the tops of steeples. At any 
second one of them will contact 
the down-seeking leader — and 
when that happens lightning will 
stalk the brief pathway between 
earth and sky. 

“I see it,” Selena breathes. “I 
live.” 

At that moment I strike with my 



STORMSEEKER 



113 




brain, exerting that miraculous 
power, that leverage which can be 
obtained only when one’s neural 
system branches into crevices in 
another continuum. The leader, 
flame-bright now, changes direc- 
tion and moves southward to 
where Archbold is waiting in his 
underground rooms. On the 
ground beneath it the positive 
image also changes course, its 
white streamers reaching higher, in 
supplication, in — love. 

“Now, Archbold,’’ I whisper 
into the microphone. “Now!’’ 

His telescopic steel mast, driven 
by explosives, spears up into the 
sky and penetrates the leader, 
absorbing its charge. The ground 
image leaps forward eagerly but 
its streamers are sucked down as it 
encounters Archbold’s carefully 
spread blankets of steel mesh. Both 
charges — cloud-borne negative 
and earth-bound positive — flow 
down massive cables. In an instant 
their energy is expended, far below 
ground, in one of the experiments 
with which Archbold hopes to 
achieve a true understanding of 
the nature of matter by accelerat- 
ing particles to speeds far greater 
than they ever achieve in nature. 
At this moment, however, I am not 
concerned with the physicist’s 
philosophical absurdities and ar- 
cana. 

“They’ve gone,’’ Selena says. 
“What happened?” 

I hold the sled on its course with 
unsteady hands. “I delivered the 



power of a lightning stroke to 
Archbold, as I promised.” 

She examines me with dismayed 
eyes, her face a calm goddess- 
mask in the instrument lights. 

“You enjoyed it.” 

“Of course.” 

“You enjoyed it too much.” 

“I — I don’t understand.” As al- 
ways, a strange sad weakness is 
spreading through my limbs. 

“I won’t give you children,” she 
says, with the peacefulness of 
utter conviction. “You have no 
instinct for life.” 

T he storm season is almost 
over now. I have not seen 
Selena since that night and I often 
muse about why she left me. She 
was right about the nature of my 
work, of course. There would be no 
vegetation or animals or human 
beings on Earth were lightning not 
there to transform atmospheric 
nitrogen into soil-nourishing nitric 
acids. And so by diverting the 
great discharges into Archbold’s 
lair I am, in a very small way, 
opposing my mind and strength to 
the global tides of life itself. But I 
suspect that my infinitesmal effect 
on the biosphere is of no concern 
to Selena. I suspect she has a more 
immediate, more personal reason 
for rejecting me. 

There is no time to think about 
such things now, though. Another 
storm is coming, perhaps the last 
of the season — and I must fly to 
meet it. ★

S TRANGE — and a little foot- 
coldening — to be sitting in this 
particular reviewing stand. 
Following Algis Budrys in any- 
thing but a chowline is pressure 
on the ego. There are reviewers 
and there are critics and there are 
reviewers who pretend they are 
critics. A.J. is a critic and one of 
the very best. So much of the man 
himself shows in what and how he 
reviews — and he is a good man. I 
hope he comes back soon. 



¥>0 YOU like Retief, Keith 
^^aumer’s gallivanting dip- 
lomat? Personally I don’t, and I 
don’t mind telling you why: I find 
nothing admirable or amusing 
about lies and double-dealing, 
and in addition, a pratt-fall has 



115 




for me more broken back about it 
than belly-laugh. So perhaps the 
defect is mine. What slams the ul- 
timate lid on the whole scam is 
Laumer/Retief’s light-hearted 
callousness toward one species 
or another of funny little green 
niggers. When the nineteenth- 
century empire builders swapped a 
two-bit jew’s-harp for a hundred- 
weight of ivory there was always 
more in it for them than a favor- 
able balance of trade — it was the 
arrogant joy of taking advantage 
of the dum-dums. When you’re not 
sure you’re a big man it’s lovely to 
have overt proof that you are; and 
this, it seems, is a fair description 
of Retief’s marrow. I love comedy, 
but I confess to a kind of tone deaf- 
ness in these particular frequencies. 
When Retief needs a boat and tips 
all of its occupants into the river 
so he can steal it, I find myself di- 
verted into wondering whether the 
natives all made it to shore. Retief 
and Laumer don’t seem to care. 

Anyway, if you do like Retief 
there’s a full measure of him 
around: Retief of the CDT from 
Doubleday, at $4.95 — five stories 
originally published in //—and 
a novel, Retief s Ransom — which 
ran as If’s complete-in-one-issue 
novel in the October ’71 number 
under the title. The All-Together- 
Planet — now from Putnam, also 
$4.95. 



What brings all this up, actual- 
ly, is another Laumer, this one 
from Scribner’s, Dinosaur Beach 
($4.95). Really another Lau- 
mer — another kind of writer al- 
together. It opens in the vener- 
able hardheeling tradition with 
a fast throw and a sharp hook and 
flings the reader straight into 
good old sense-of-wonder, hard- 
core sf. It is at this point that this 
other Laumer emerges, with the 
hero’s meeting The Girl. Not on- 
ly is he taken with her — the author 
is, too, and she becomes some- 
thing real who evokes something 
tender. Something sexual, too, in 
the best possible way: the sex is 
absolutely essential to the plot. 
Then we go on to a fine spectacu- 
lar of time-travel and con- 
flict — the kind you don’t have to 
understand; you just ride it. And 
it ends pleasantly. What fascinated 
me the most, however, was the re- 
peated surfacing of the good writer. 
You just can’t keep ’em down. 

J .G. BALLARD, for example — a 
writer’s writer, surely, and a 
reader’s writer too. Not long ago 
I came out of the elevator at the 
local art museum and, found my- 
self face to face with five Picasso 
originals. They were abstrac- 
tions and though I have no pre- 
tensions in the field of graphic 
art I found myself grabbed and 



116 



GALAXY 




held. I once saw some of Picasso’s 
early works — of the “academy” 
and “blue” periods — and they 
were meticulously objective, 
wonderfully wrought, camera- 
accurate, and I remember how 
it occured to me that though one 
may know nothing about art as 
such, there is still an impact in ab- 
stractions by artists who have 
learned the rules and then “brok- 
en” them, which is just not present 
in work by people who do ab- 
stractions because they simply 
can’t draw. I don’t know enough 
about it to be able to tell you just 
what the difference is, but it is 
most powerfully there. The same 
thing holds true of free verse by 
people who have gone through the 
agonies of prosody and have 
learned to write sonnets and cin- 
quains and haiku and rondeaux re- 
doubles. Once they have learned 
to burnish words through such ar- 
duous disciplines their free and 
unburdened work has a leaven- 
ing which is unmistakable. An- 
other analogy might be this: for 
eighteen years you have been 
carrying, night and day, a forty- 
pound pack on your back and one 
day somebody cuts the straps. 
Man, after that, when you walk 
you fly. 

Ballard shot off a firework in 
our faces a few years ago with 
something called The Terminal 



Beach. It’s in a new Ballard col- 
lection from Putnam called Chro- 
nopolis ($6.95) and it surfed in on 
the first crest of the so-called 
New Wave. It sent the labelers in- 
to paroxysms, the tradition- 
alists into fits and the sincerest 
flatterers to their typewriters. 
It’s a strangely structured thing, 
original but not unique (the dis- 
tinction being that not even the 
author can copy an unique), pro- 
vocative in its content and effec- 
tive in its mode. It would seem to 
many that in some way Ballard 
was born when he wrote this story; 
clearly he was not and one has to 
wonder what he did before, between 
and around such an extraordinary 
work. There are many answers in 
this book. The earliest entry is 
1957, Manhole, and deals with the 
psychophysical effects of a brain 
operation which eliminates sleep. 
Not necessarily in chronological 
order, we have straightforward 
stories dealing with astronomy, 
biology, biochemistry, physics 
and, above all, time. The point is 
made clearly that Ballard had 
paid his dues as a fine-honed hard- 
core s-f writer. He has earned his 
right to write and have people 
read “more psycho-literary ideas, 
more meta-biological and meta- 
chemical concepts, private time- 
systems, synthetic psychologies and 
space-times, more of the remote.

somber half-worlds one glimpses 
in the paintings of schizophrenics, 
all in all a complete speculative 
poetry and fantasy of science.” He 
wrote these words (of which more 
below) in 1962. 

There are few if any stories here 
cast on that strange endless beach 
where Ballard and I dwell from 
time to time, he while he writes 
them, I while I read them. He be- 
lieves that place exists or he 
couldn’t write the way he does 
about it — and I believe every word 
he says and as far as I am con- 
cerned the conviction of the two of 
us makes it real — and somewhere 
these driven people of his pop- 
ulate that endless crystal sand, 
carve clouds with gliders, wear 
clothes that are alive and neurotic 
and buy flowers that sing. The 
seeds, however, of this concept, 
this “beach country,” are here in 
these earlier works. A world in 
which the oceans have gone and 
one in which great masses of 
Martian desert sand have been 
dumped on and have buried Cape 
Kennedy — the science center 
where a biologist and a cosmol- 
ogist and some graduate students 
watch the oncoming death of the 
cosmos. I know Ballard has made 
waves; I know he will not stop; I 
am most pleased to watch where he 
is going. 

The Ballard quotation above 



was taken from Science Fic- 
tion — What It's All About, by Sam 
J. Lund wall, who wrote his book 
originally in Swedish and trans- 
lated it himself. The introduc- 
tion is by Don Wollheim and it’s 
from Ace at 950. I find it the most 
valuable addition yet to the grow- 
ing shelf of books about sf. Lund- 
walTs European listening post 
gives him an objectivity we have 
not encountered before. He 
clearly loves the field. His reading 
is very wide (though containing 
some infuriating holes) and his 
opinions are hard-held and de- 
finite — fine wherever you agree 
with him. Especially interesting 
are his surveys of foreign 
sf — Scandinavian, West and East 
German, French, Polish, Rus- 
sian, Dutch. And like all his 
colleagues, he adds more com- 
bustibles to the search for a de- 
finition of s-f. (Personally, I am 
prepared to abandon that effort. 
The only people who seem able to 
define it are those who think they 
never read or see it. They’re wrong, 
of course.) 

I MENTIONED “unique” 
books. I have a shelf of them in 
my head — A.J. Langguth’s Jesus 
Christs, Joseph Heller’s Catch 22, 
The Werewolf of Paris by Guy En- 
dore and his Methinks the Lady 
(he’s the only author who appears

twice), Wylie’s Finnley Wren ... a 
few others. It’s a narrow shelf and 
candidates for it come along sel- 
dom, but one just has. Ice, by Anna 
Kavan (Doubleday, $4.50), has a 
preface by Brian Aldiss, who knew 
the author — and I don’t know 
whether to urge you to read the 
book before reading the preface 
or not. If you do read the book first 
the preface makes it almost man- 
datory that you read the book 
again immediately because so 
much of the symbolism becomes 
explosively clear. The book is 
written with an exquisiteness and 
polish I haven’t seen since the late 
Isaac Dinesen; in all other re- 
spects the author’s modus is strict- 
ly her own. It’s one of those rare 
reading experiences wherein 
you read three paragraphs past 
something, skid to a stop and say 
"'What?'' and go back and do it 
over. She very soon lulls you into 
simply accepting her narrative 
wherever it goes. That’s called 
spellbinding. And once you’ve put 
it down, it will be with you as long 
as you live. 

DRIEFLY noted: You’ll deeply 
^enjoy The Spun Sugar Hole by 
Jerry (Night Slaves, Costigan’s 
Needle) Sohl (Simon & Schuster, 
$6.95) — a mainstream novel with 
a delightful thread of sf all 
through it. It’s a romp and crazy 



as hell, but a provocative romp 
which sheds a bright and multi- 
colored light on a lot of profound 
humanity . Watch D.G. Comp- 
ton, absolutely certain to be one of 
the big ones. He wrote Synthajoy 
and The Steel Crocodile and now, 
from Ace (950), gives us Farewell 
Earth’s Bliss, a novel with a sting 
in its tail: look out! . Also from 
Ace, at 750, George Bamber’s The 
Sea is Boiling Hot, a well-paced, 
well-sexed, timely and tumbling 
damn good story . The only rea- 
son R. A. Lafferty’s Arrive at 
Easterwine doesn’t make the “uni- 
que” shelf is that, astonishingly, I 
believe Lafferty could to it again. 
He has to be the maddest, the most 
colorful, the most unexpected, the 
most outrageous writer alive. 
He’s totally drunk on words and 
he really and truly doesn’t give a 
bleep where he goes with all this. 
It’s from Scribner’s and goes for 
cheap at $4.95 . You’ll be glad 
to know that you can have in one 
package, from Doubleday 
($4.95), fifteen of Roger Zelazny’s 
beautiful yarns, including as the 
title story The Doors of His Face, 
The Lamps of His Mouth. The 
story that still makes me weep, A 
Rose for Ecclesiastes, is included. 

God willing. I’ll be back with 
news on collections and antholo- 
gies. It’s been a rich season. ★

“Tell them I came and no one 
answered, 

That I kept my word,” he said. 

rilHE office was big. Too big, An- 
^ drew White thought. Across the 
broad, blue, deep-piled carpet with 
the woven seal in the middle to 
the carved, white door by which 
visitors entered was a good twen- 
ty yards — more distance than 
could have been traversed in the 
entire flat in which White had 
been born — and people who came 
in that door were diminished, like 
Alice. 

That was the way it was in- 
tended, no doubt. Space equals im- 
portance. And who was more im- 
portant than the President of the 
United States? 

Everybody. White thought. 

The President of the United 
States is a lonely man, White be- 
gan to compose in his head. He 
takes unto himself all the loneli- 
ness of the people he serves. And 
he is a lowly man. Every citizen 
is higher than he is. He exists to 
sign his name to other mens deci- 
sions, to shoulder the blame when 
things go wrong. He is a figure- 
head and a scapegoat. Fellow 
Americans. I have made my deci- 
sion. I will not run for a second 
term . 



But he would, he knew. He 
would not run away from his duty 
and his duty was to complete the 
job his predecessors had begun 
more than fifty years ago. The job 
was not done, God knew, and it 
was becoming harder all the time 
to tell people what was wrong, to 
show them the way it had been, to 
convince them that the battle 
needed to be fought anew each day, 
that peace was an illusion. 

Maybe, he thought, it is the 
ghosts of the other men who have 
occupied this chair that haunt me 
today, that make me feel 
small . 

He stretched his shoulders and 
felt the long, flat muscles rippling 
under the layer of fat too many 
chicken dinners had put there. He 
knew he was a big man, an impos- 
ing President, six feet, six inches 
from the soles of his feet to the top 
of his ’fro, and the physical equal 
of any of them — of any man who 
came through that door. 

Perhaps it was the smell of the 
place, the smell of fresh air un- 
tainted by the odors of cooking 
food or of other people, the smell 
of paper and ink, of electrical 
gadgets functioning noiselessly 
to bring information or send or- 
ders, the smell of power — every- 
thing was changed from what he 
had known as a boy, as a young 
man. The scent of the freshly

mown grass made him turn his 
back on the door and look through 
the broad windows behind the 
desk toward the green lawn and 
the leafy trees and the fence, be- 
yotid which ran the broad streets 
and rose the tall towers of Wash- 
ington, which had replaced the fa- 
miliar ghetto he had fought to es- 
cape — and found himself remem- 
bering frequently now as if he 
had been fond of it, as if it had been 
a happy home. 

He thought how wonderful it 
would be if he could take off his 
shoes and walk barefooted in the 
grass the way he used to do in the 
park when a boy. What a fine 
picture that would be — the Presi- 
dent walking barefooted on the 
White House lawn — and he knew if 
he did it the picture would be re- 
produced in one hundred million 
homes across the nation and the 
world and it would win him votes. 
The people liked to think of a 
President’s being impulsive 
when it came to matters of the 
heart, a bit comic in domestic af- 
fairs, a bit inferior to each of 
them in some way. But he knew he 
couldn’t do it. He would not have 
time. He had no time now for any- 
thing that he liked to do. 

WE HEARD the door open and 
^^turned. John stood in the door- 
way. He was a good-looking man. 



White thought. He got his good 
looks from his mother and his size 
from his father. Maybe a little 
conservative in his dress and hair 
style but a good-looking brother 
all the same. 

“Dr. MacDonald is calling 
from the Project,” John said. His 
tone was stiff. 

John still recalled last night’s 
conversation. White thought, 
and knew suddenly why he felt 
depressed, why he felt like resign- 
ing, why he felt like giving up. It 
was because of John. 

“Who is Dr. MacDonald?” 
White asked. 

“The director of the Project in 
Puerto Rico, Mr. President,” 
John said. “The one that’s been lis- 
tening for radio communica- 
tion from the stars — listening for 
more than fifty years. They picked 
up something a few months ago 
that sounded like a message 
from — some star or other, I for- 
get. From what MacDonald says 
I gather they’ve got a transla- 
tion.” 

“Good Lord,” White said. 
“Have I met him?” 

“Once or twice, I think — at a re- 
ception at least.” 

White sighed. “Put him on.” He 
had a feeling of impending dis- 
aster. Maybe that was what ev- 
erything had been leading up to 
today. 



122 



GALAXY 




He felt his stomach sinking un- 
der a cold weight as a window 
opened between his desk and an- 
other in a distant room. The face 
of a man a bit past middle age 
looked at White. The man’s hair 
was sandy with little apparent 
gray and his face was calm and pa- 
tient and worn. White had seen the 
face before, he recognized, and 
remembered that he had liked the 
man on sight. Now he sympa- 
thized with the man’s problem, 
whatever it was — he caught him- 
self before he committed himself 
too far. 

“Dr. MacDonald,’’ he said. 
“So good to talk to you again. 
How are things in Puerto Rico.” 

“Mr. President — ” MacDon- 
ald said and paused either to 
weigh his words or better to con- 
trol them. “Mr. President, this 
moment is as historic as the one 
that first gave us atomic reac- 
tion. I wish I had some memor- 
able phrase to announce it, but all 
I can say is that we have received a 
message from intelligent beings 
on a world circling one of the twin 
suns of Capella — and we have a 
translation. We are not alone.” 

“Congratulations, Dr. Mac- 
Donald,” White said auto- 
matically. “How many people 
know about this?” 

“I was going to tell you — ” 
MacDonald began and then 



broke off. “Fifteen,” he said. 
“Perhaps twenty.” 

“Are they all there?” White 
asked. 

“They’ve scattered.” 

“Can you get them back togeth- 
er? Immediately?” 

“All except Jeremiah and his 
daughter. They left a few minutes 
ago. 

“Jeremiah, the Solitarian 
evangelist?” White asked. “What 
was he doing there?” 

MacDonald blinked. “His op- 
position was a threat to the Proj- 
ect. He saw the message transla- 
tion come off the computer print- 
out and is no longer opposed. Mr. 
President, the message — ” 

“Get him back to your office,” 
White said. “He must not reveal 
the message, whatever it is, nor 
will you or any member of your 
staff.” 

“And what about an answer to 
those who sent it?” 

“Out of the question,” White 
said brusquely. “There will be no 
announcement, no leaks, no an- 
swer. The effects of what you’ve 
told me may be incalculable. I 
must consult with my people. I 
suggest you do the same.” 

WTIIIR. PRESIDENT,” Mac- 
Donald said, “I think you 
are making a serious mistake. I 
urge you to reconsider. Let me

give you the background, the 
goals, the significance and mean- 
ing of the Project.” 

White paused and thought. Not 
many people told him he was 
wrong. John sometimes did — he 
and this man MacDonald could 
be difficult. White knew he 
should cherish the nay-sayers, but 
he found them a trial — he disliked 
being told he was making a mis- 
take. 

Teddy Roosevelt, someone had 
written, made up his mind some- 
where in the region of his hips and 
that was the way with Andrew 
White, he thought. He did not al- 
ways know where his decisions 
came from, but they almost al- 
ways were right. 

He had to believe in his hips. 
“I’ll come to the Project,” he said. 
“You can try to convince me.” 
There — that was all the scientists 
really wanted, a chance to be 
heard. “For security reasons I 
can’t specify the time and you will 
not tell anyone else. But it should 
be within a few days.” He broke 
the connection. 

“John!” 

John appeared in the doorway. 
“I’m making the arrangements 
now,” he said. “And I’m having a 
brief history of the Project put to- 
gether for you.” 

“Thank you,” White said. John 
was a good man and an indispen- 



sable assistant, he thought. 
“You’ll go with me, won’t you?” he 
asked humbly. 

John nodded. “If you wish,” he 
said. But he was still reserved. 

After the door had closed again 
White thought that perhaps the 
trip would let them get back to- 
gether again, give them a chance 
to talk to each other, really to 
communicate instead of using 
words like stones. 

And then John was once more in 
the doorway. “Dr. MacDonald 
called back,” he said. “The pri- 
vate plane carrying Jeremiah and 
his daughter back to Texas al- 
ready had taken off when he was 
through talking to you.” 

White thought briefly about the 
possibility of intercepting the 
plane, of having Jeremiah put in- 
to custody as he landed, of having 
the plane shot down at sea on some 
pretext or other. But it felt all 
wrong. 

“Leave an urgent message for 
him at whatever his destination 
is. He’s to be told that I want to 
talk to him before he does any- 
thing about the message. And re- 
route us through Texas.” 

John hesitated in tne doorway. 
“Father,” he said, paused and 
continued; “Mr. President, Dr. 
MacDonald is right. You’re mak- 
ing a mistake. This is a scientif- 
ic decision, not a political one.” 



124 



GALAXY 




White shook his head slowly, 
sorrowfully. “Everything that 
touches people is political. But to 
avoid mistakes is why I’m going 
to the Project — to give Dr. Mac- 
Donald a chance to convince me 
I’m wrong.” 

The words contained only a 
half-truth. He was going to Puer- 
to Rico to make his decision 
stick. And for other reasons he 
himself had not yet fully ex- 
plored. He knew the truth about his 
natives — and so did John. 

Damn it. Why couldn’t the boy 
realize that it wasn’t intelligence 
or even wisdom he was talking 
about; it was just living. He had 
been there. He had been young and 
he knew what it was like. 

He wanted to save John pain. 
John had never been middle- 
aged. 

“Those times are finished. 
Father,” John had said. “They 
were fine; they were great; they 
were necessary like the pioneers; 
but they're over. You’ve got to 
know when the frontier is gone, 
when the battle is ended. You’ve 
won. There’s nothing as unneces- 
sary as a soldier when the war is 
over. It’s time to do something 
else now.” 

‘‘I’ve heard that all my life from 
people like you — from quitters,” 
White had yelled. ‘‘It isn’t over; the 



inequalities haven’t been re- 
moved — they’ve just become bet- 
ter hidden. We’ve got to keep 
fighting until we’ve got a final 
victory, until there’s no chance of 
its slipping away from us. You’ve 
got to help, boy! I didn’t raise you 
to pass ...” 

But what he should have said 
was, ‘‘I need you, son. You’re my 
link to the future, the reason for 
all I think, all I’ve done. ” 

And John would have said, ‘‘I 
never thought of it like that, Fath- 

p » 

er . 

Why didn’t the boy ever call him 
Dad? 

II 

T he trip from Washington to 
Texas, from catapult to 
touchdown, was short and un- 
eventful, no longer than it took 
John to read aloud to White a brief 
report on the Project. White sat 
in his chair, head back, eyes closed, 
listening to the muffled whine of 
the air trying to find a hold on the 
polished metal skin a few inches 
away, and hated being separated 
and alone. He detested mechani- 
cal and electrical devices that 
kept him away from people, that 
hurtled him here and there, that in- 
sulated him from the world, and 
he was surrounded by them^he 
couldn’t get away from them. 



THE ANSWER

As he listened to John’s voice 
reading the report he heard the 
boy become interested, get in- 
volved, and he wanted to say. Stop 
reading. Stop telling me these 
dull things that I don’t want to 
hear, that will only add to my 
loneliness. Don’t waste your pas- 
sion on these pointless proj- 
ects — save it for me! Stop reading 
and let us talk about matters more 
suited for a father and son — about 
love and the past, about love and 
the future, about us. But he 
knew John would not approve. He 
would not understand. So he lis- 
tened to John’s voice. 

The Project had been launched 
in the late seventies to listen for 
possible messages from other 
intelligent beings in the uni- 
verse. Considerable discussion 
of how such communication 
might be transmitted and what the 
nature of the message might be 
had preceded the Project during 
the late fifties and sixties. There 
had even been a three-month trial 
run, given the name Project Oz- 
ma, by astronomer Frank Drake 
using the 85-foot steerable radio 
telescope at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory at 
Green Bank, West Virginia. The 
Project had been set up with the 
expectation that it might have to 
operate for several decades 
without results. Scientists had 



felt certain that within our gal- 
axy alone, out of billions of stars 
some would have habitable plan- 
ets, some could have intelligent 
life and even a technological civ- 
ilization capable of sending or 
receiving signals between the 
stars. But it would take time to 
check them all and to test all the 
reasonable methods of com- 
munication. 

The first three decades of the 
Project had been troubled. Possi- 
bly, since listening was easier 
and cheaper than sending, every- 
body everywhere was listening. 
Enthusiasm on Earth had leaked 
away over the years as all the ef- 
forts, all the imagination, pro- 
duced nothing but silence; direc- 
tors came and went; morale was a 
constant problem; funding be- 
came perfunctory. Then Mac- 
Donald had come to the Project 
and been named director. Still no 
messages were received — or rec- 
ognized, if received — but the 
Project was pulled together, 
earlier concepts of the long-term 
nature of the task were rein- 
forced by new thinking and the 
search went on. 

Then, fifty years after the Proj- 
ect was begun, a Project scien- 
tist checking tapes of the routine 
radio telescopy from the giant 
radio telescope in orbit around 
the Earth, the Big Ear, thought he

heard voices. He filtered them, 
subtracted noise and interfer- 
ence, reinforced the informa- 
tion and heard snatches of music 
and voices speaking English. 

They were bits and pieces of 
radio programs broadcast on 
Earth during the thirties and 
picked up, apparently, some for- 
ty-five light-years away and re- 
broadcast toward Earth from the 
direction of the twin red giant 
suns called Capella. 

But this was not the mes- 
sage — it had been merely the “hel- 
lo,” the attention-getter, and the 
message had not been deciphered 
until now. 

rilHE plane landed in Houston. 
^ White’s first question to the 
officials who were waiting to 
greet him was, “Where’s Jeremi- 
ah?” 

They were embarrassed. One of 
them finally gave him Jeremi- 
ah’s message. “If the President 
wants to see me he knows where he 
can find me.” 

White sighed. “Take me to Je- 
remiah,” he said. 

They argued, but they took him 
through the clean wide streets of 
Houston and up to the incredible 
dome that was called the temple of 
the Solitarians and down under- 
ground passages, dusty and dark, 
until they reached a small room 



that seemed even smaller under 
the oppressive weight of the stadi- 
um above. 

The old man looked up from an 
old makeup table and mirror. 
His hair was white, his face was 
lined and his eyes were dark, and 
White knew at once that he would 
not be able to move the evange- 
list. But he had to try. 

“Jeremiah?” he asked. 

“Mr. President?” Jeremiah 
said in a “render-unto-Caesar” 
tone. 

“You have returned from 
Arecibo,” White said, “with a copy 
of a message.” 

“I returned with nothing,” Jere- 
miah said, “and any message I 
received was addressed to me 
alone. I cannot speak for any oth- 
er man.” 

“I speak for many other men,” 
White said. “And in their name I 
ask that you not reveal your mes- 
sage to anyone else.” 

“So might Pharaoh have said to 
Moses when he came down from 
Mt. Horeb.” 

“But I am not Pharaoh and you 
are not Moses and the message is 
not the Ten Commandments,” 
White said. 

Jeremiah’s eyes burned. His 
voice, in contrast, was curiously 
gentle. “You speak with a greater 
certainty than I can pretend to. 
You have legions—” his glance

flickered briefly over the guards 
and assistants who crowded the 
doorway and the hall outside — 
“and all I have is my solitary mis- 
sion. But I will fulfill it unless I am 
physically restrained and I will 
fulfill it this evening.” At the end 
his voice had not seemed to change, 
but now it was smooth hard steel. 

White tried one more time. “If 
you do this,” he said, “you will be 
sowing dragon’s teeth of dis- 
sension and strife that may well 
destroy this country.” 

A smile twisted Jeremiah’s face 
and was gone. “I am not Cadmus 
and this is not Thebes — and who 
knows God’s plan for man?” 

White started to leave and Jere- 
miah said, “Wait.” He turned back 
to his dressing table and picked up 
a piece of paper. “Here,” he said, 
holding it out. “You will be the 
first to receive the message from 
the hands of Jeremiah.” 

White took it, turned and walked 
the long echoing corridors back to 
the cars and said to the anonymous 
men who escorted him, “I want full 
coverage.” He boarded the plane to 
continue his journey to Puerto 
Rico. 

J OHN had a recording of the 
voices. First came only whis- 
pers. They were faint but complex 
like a blending of thousands of lips 
and tongues. Though they might 



have been made without lips and 
tongues, by creatures who had no 
familiar organs but communicated 
by humming in their thorax or 
rubbing their antennae together. 

White thought about the long 
years of listening to this and won- 
dered how men had endured it, had 
not gone mad. 

The whispering grew louder and 
became the sound of static, mis- 
cellaneous sound, noise, and then 
something more, something com- 
ing clearer, something almost in- 
telligible, began to come through, 
reminding White of times when he 
had been a small boy lying in bed 
nearly asleep and people had been 
talking in the next room. He had 
been unable to make out what they 
were saying and unable to rouse 
himself enough to listen. 

Next, from John’s tape, came 
snatches of music and bits of voices 
saying broken sentences between 
the static. 

“POPCRACKLEPOP,” they 
said. “Voss you dare shar CRACK-

“The voices,” White said after 
the silence returned. 

“The voices,” John agreed. 

White noticed that they had said 
the words differently, that John’s 
tone had been excited and pleased. 
White was not pleased. He was 
disturbed at the thought of crea- 
tures somewhere out there with ap- 
paratus — forty-five light years 
from here — listening to the sounds 
of Earth, alien ears listening to 
the voices of Earth and sending 
them back again transmuted, 
dirtied. He had been on television 
often and recently on radio as 
well — since its revival — and he did 
not like to think of his voice and 



picture fleeing on restless waves 
through space for anyone or any- 
thing to intercept and possess — a 
part of him. He wanted out of 
having to believe. 

“Maybe the voices are just a re- 
flection,” he said. 

“From forty-five light years 
away?” John asked. “We’d never 
pick up a thing.” 

White tried to imagine the in- 
credible distances between the stars 
that the voices must have traveled 
to reach that far place and return. 
He could not. He thought about an 
ant walking from Washington to 
San Francisco and back and that 
was not enough. 

“Maybe it’s closer,” he said. 

“Then we wouldn’l be getting 
the program from ninety years 
ago,” John said. 

“Maybe it’s been floating 
around in the atmosphere all these 
years,” White said, waving his 
hands in the air. “Oh, 1 know. 
That’s impossible, too. Only it’s 
no more impossible than thinking 
of aliens sending us messages.” 

Or this, he thought. He looked at 
the piece of paper Jeremiah had 
given him. There was a drawing on 
it, black ink on white paper — it 
looked as if it had been done by a 
talented amateur. Perhaps it had 
been drawn by Jeremiah himself. 
It was a drawing of a stylized 
angel, wings spread behind, arms 



THE ANSWER 



129 




stretched in a kind of welcome or carrying a message of God’s love, 
acceptance, its face peaceful. It and it was surrounded by a border 
was an angel of mercy, of love, of entwined flowers. 




By what impossible magic, 
White wondered, had the voices 
been translated into this? 

“The whole cosmological pic- 
ture,” John was saying, “makes the 
contact believable. There had to be 
intelligent life out there. This tape 
would be impossible if there were 
not other creatures in the galaxy, 
intelligent enough, curious 
enough, and capable of communi- 
cating with us across the light 
years, wanting, needing to find 
other creatures like themselves 
who could look at themselves and 
at the stars and wonder — ” 

White was caught in John’s 
vision for a moment. He looked at 
his son’s face and saw the excite- 
ment in it, the raptness, and he 
thought. You’re a stranger to me 
and / cannot speak to you. 

He loved the boy — that was the 
trouble. He didn’t want to see him 
get hurt the way he had been hurt. 
He wanted to save him the tor- 
ment, save him from learning 
things the hard way. That was the 
essence of humanity, being able 
to learn from the mistakes and 
successes of others, not having to 
learn it all over again each gener- 
ation. He knew what John would 
say. “You’re just following in- 
stinct. Being human is being able 
to do something different.” 

Why was it always like this? The 



boy was an alien, but somehow he 
had to communicate. 

UERTO RICO was silent. As 
the powerful black car that had 
met him at the airport sped over 
the dark roads White was aware 
only of the quiet hum of the steam 
turbine, the smells of trees, grass 
and sea. 

This was better than Washing- 
ton, he thought, and better than 
Houston. Or any place else he 
could think of where he had been 
recently. The concern that kept 
coiling tighter in his stomach like 
the spring of a wind-up toy began 
to relax. 

What had happened to all the 
wind-up toys he had known when 
a child? He wondered. Replaced, 
he thought, by battery-powered 
toys. Perhaps he was the last of 
the wind-up toy people. A wind- 
up President, he thought — wound 
up tight in the ghetto and now 
working out all the frustrations 
and aggressions that had pushed 
him into the White House. 

Wind him up and see him right 
the ancient wrongs — but carefully, 
carefully, so that domestic tran- 
quility is not disturbed, so that 
international peace is not threat- 
ened. 

He laughed a bit ruefully and 
thought that something in that of- 
fice in Washington did not let a

man be what he had been or what 
he wanted to be, but forced him to 
be a President. 

John was looking at him and he 
realized that John had not heard 
him laugh for a long time. He 
leaned over to put his hand on 
John’s. 

“It’s all right,’’ he said. “It was 
just a passing idea.” 

And he thought, 7 could be a bet- 
ter man here. Maybe not a better 
President, but a better man. 

“We’re almost there,” John 
said. 

White took his hand away. 
“How do you know?” 

“I’ve been here before,” John 
said. 

White settled back in his seat. 
He had not known that John was 
familiar with this place. He won- 
dered why he had not been told 
about John’s visit to the Project. 
What else about John was a secret, 
a mystery? 

fllHE mood passed. When the 

Project appeared out of the 
night, glimmering and vast and 
strange in the moonlight. White 
turned from it and would not look 
at it. The car pulled up beside a 
long, low concrete building. 

MacDonald was waiting for him 
inside the building. Again White 
knew a surge of empathy toward 
the man. He felt sorry that he had 



to kill what MacDonald had given 
his life to. 

MacDonald escorted the Presi- 
dential party down the painted con- 
crete corridor. “Mr. President,” he 
said, “you do us honor.” But he 
walked casually and talked easily 
as if this party were no different 
from any of the others he had 
guided on night tours. 

The corridors were busy. Men 
and women were moving purpose- 
fully, as if it were the middle of the 
day instead of the middle of the 
night. And abruptly White re- 
alized that this was the busy part of 
the twenty-four hours for the Proj- 
ect — listening was best at night. 
What would it be like, he won- 
dered, to have the days and nights 
always reversed? To have light 
and dark -turned around like a bat 
or an owl? And he thought that he 
should know the answer to that as 
well as anybody. 

People passed. MacDonald did 
not introduce any of them, per- 
haps sensing, without being told, 
that this was an unofficial visit — or 
perhaps not wanting to stir up spec- 
ulation in the Project about his 
visit. But some of the staff mem- 
bers glanced at White, then glanced 
a second time with a shock of rec- 
ognition. White was used to that. 
And there were some who were 
busy talking to each other and 
glanced at him and continued 



132 



GALAXY 




their conversations without a 
pause. White was not used to 
that. He discovered that he didn’t 
like it. He had thought that it was 
his loss of anonymity that he dis- 
liked, but he realized that he dis- 
liked more not being recognized 
at all. 

He also disliked the sterile cor- 
ridor, echoing with footsteps and 
voices, and the room filled with 
electronic equipment through 
which he was ushered. He recog- 
nized oscilloscopes and re- 
corders, but much of the equip- 
ment was alien to him and he was 
pleased that it should remain so. A 
man was sitting in front of a panel 
with earphones over his head. 
MacDonald waved to him as they 
passed and the man waved back, 
but his eyes were glazed as if they 
were focused on something 
hundreds of miles away. Billions 
of miles — light-years. White cor- 
rected himself. 

He was ushered through an- 
other room that was virtually all 
computer. The walls were one great 
computer — cables snaked into 
other rooms and the floor was 
crowded with data inputs and 
printers. It was the biggest setup 
of its kind White had ever seen, 
bigger even than the Pentagon’s 
or the State Department’s simu- 
lators or the Information De- 
partment’s data files. The place 



smelled of oil and electricity and it 
talked to itself of information 
and events and correlations, of 
shoes and ships and sealing wax 
and it added one and one and one 
very fast, over and over again. Be- 
ing in that room was like being in- 
side a computer — ^White felt him- 
self to be a modern Jonah inside a 
great fish not yet born and he was 
relieved when it opened a mouth 
and spat him out into an office. 

The office did not reveal the evi- 
dences of a man’s life, of twenty 
years of effort and dedication. Like 
the rest of the building it was plain. 
A simple desk was set in front of 
tall book shelves built into the wall 
and the shelves had real books on 
them with leather bindings. Some, 
of the books had titles in foreign 
languages and White remem- 
bered from John’s briefing that 
MacDonald had been a linguist 
before he became an engineer. 

“Set up my information cen- 
ter,’’ he said to John. 

“You can plug it right into the 
computer,’’ MacDonald said. “My 
assistant will show you where.’’ 

White and the Project director 
were alone. They faced each other 
and White hardened his heart 
against the man. 

If MacDonald recognized the 
situation he did not acknowledge it. 
Instead he asked casually, “Jere- 
miah?” 



THE ANSWER 



133 




White shook his head. “He 
refused to be moved. He is going 
to release the message to his 
faithful. His message, he called it.” 

MacDonald motioned him to a 
chair. “And so it is,” he said. “His 
message, my message, your 
message.” 

White shook his head. “Not my 
message. Here is a copy of his 
message.” He handed MacDonald 
the piece of paper Jeremiah had 
given him. 

MacDonald looked at the draw- 
ing of Jeremiah’s angel, pursed his 
lips and nodded. “Yes, that’s what 
Jeremiah saw. You didn’t stop 
him?” 

“Some things a President can do 
and should do. Some he can do and 
should not do. Some things he 
cannot do. Stopping Jeremiah 
falls somewhere between the sec- 
ond and the third. But that — ” he 
indicated the piece of paper — 
“can’t be the message.” 

“How much do you know about 
the Project?” MacDonald asked. 

“Enough,” White said, hoping 
to forestall a repetition of John’s 
briefing. 

“You know about the long lis- 
tening without results?” Mac- 
Donald asked. 

“I know all that,” White said. 

“And then the voices?” Mac- 
Donald pushed a button on his 
desk. 



“I’ve heard them,” White said, 
but he was too late. The voices had 
already started. 

HI 

rilHE acoustics were better here 
^ or something had been lost on 
John’s tape. The whisperings that 
began it were more urgent here — 
they held a note of pleading, of in- 
sistence, of anger, of despair. They 
shook White so that when they be- 
came the voices he relaxed as if the 
effort to hear and understand had 
taken all his strength. The voices, 
too, were a little different, as if 
they started at another point in an 
endless loop, and they were more 
distinct.

White shook himself to break 
the spell. “That wasn’t the mes- 
sage,” he said. 

MacDonald adjusted a dial on 
the desk. The voices continued in 
the background like a distant 
Greek chorus commenting on their 
predicament. 

“That was only what they used 
to attract our attention.” 

CRACKLE CRACKLE POP 
hello everybody POPCRACKLE- 
POP. 

“The message was in the static 
between the voices,” MacDonald 
continued. “When we slowed it, 
stretched it, the static turned into a 
sound and silence pattern that we 
tried to decipher for months.” 

POPCRACKLE ice regusted 
CRACKLEPOP 

“I’se regusted,” White repeated 
in a deep voice and laughed. 

“You know that one?” Mac- 
Donald asked. 

“One of our folk heroes,” White 
said in a self-deprecating tone. 
“Does it bother you to have a black 
President?” 

“About as much,” MacDonald 
said, “as it bothers you to have a 
white Project director.” 

MacDonald was not only wise; 
he was shrewd. He knew that dif- 



ferences existed between men and 
these differences inevitably af- 
fected how they felt about each 
other, about themselves. White had 
liked MacDonald from the 
start — now he was beginning to ad- 
mire him and that was dangerous. 

What John wanted to do was 
even more dangerous. He thought 
there were no more differences, 
that he could forget his color and 
his people, that he could live like a 
white man, concerned with himself 
alone. How could John be so blind 
to the realities of racism? The old 
hatreds and prejudices were merely 
hidden better now. You still had to 
be on guard: to trust yourself in 
their world without the protection 
of power or of righteous anger was 
to risk your soul. His son — A ndrew 
White’s son^ could not go over. 

FINALLY it came to us,” 

^ MacDonald said. “Those 
dots and silences between the 
voices could be translated as spaces 
filled and unfilled, like a crossword 
puzzle. The computer finally 
worked it out, figured out the 
length of the message — where it 
began and where it stopped and 
what was false — static, noise — and 
what was the real message 
endlessly repeated. And it printed 
out the message for us.” 

MacDonald reached for a frame 



THE ANSWER

that until now had been face down 
on his desk. White had not noticed 
it before. How much else had he 
not noticed? Had he missed 
something that might have en- 
forced his stance in this matter? 

“Here it is,” MacDonald said. 
He turned it over and reached it 
out to White. “This is the original 
message, the first one transferred 
from electronic signals in the 
computer onto paper. We had it 
framed for you — we thought you 
might like to keep it for a while, to 
look at, to wonder about a bit, per- 
haps, and when you’re finished 
with it, when you’re tired of show- 
ing it to visitors, you might send it 
over to the Smithsonian.” 

White took the frame reluctant- 
ly as if the message were one he 
did not really want to receive, like 
a summons or a subpoena or a 
warrant. He did not want to look 
at it or wonder about it — he did 
not want it translated for him. He 
wanted to destroy it, to forget it. 
It was bad news and he under- 
stood the Egyptian tradition of 
executing the messenger who 
brought evil tidings. 

He looked at the message. It 
consisted of little marks scattered 
in random fashion across a blank 
sheet of paper. 

Whife looked up. “This is a 
message?” 

MacDonald nodded. “I know it’s 




not impressive at first glance. What 
is impressive is its origin in the 
minds of alien creatures born under 
two alien suns — red giants — forty- 
five light-years from here. That’s 
how far it traveled to reach us, to 
reshape itself into the picture 
you hold in your hands.” 

“It’s still not much,” White said. 



136 



GALAXY 




turning the frame over to look at 
the blank back as if there might be 
something more important, more 
revealing, on that side. 

“Perhaps it doesn’t seem like 
much,” MacDonald said pa- 
tiently, “but the information con- 
tained in that sketch is surprising. 
‘A picture is worth a thousand 
words,’ the Chinese are reputed to 
have said, and we can learn at least 
that much more from this than 
from words — in some arbitrary 
symbols — even if we could read the 
symbols. What we have consists of 
five hundred and eighty-nine dots 
and dashes, dots and blanks, a grid 
made up of nineteen spaces across 
and thirty-one spaces down — and 
in those spaces the Capellans have 
drawn a portrait of themselves.” 

117 HITE looked at the message 
■ ■ again. He was beginning to see 
forms and shapes in it and realized 
that his first reaction had been 
conditioned by his desire to believe 
that the computer marks were 
random, that the message was, in 
fact, meaningless. 

“Damn poor portrait,” he mut- 
tered. “Like the stick figures chil- 
dren draw.” 

“Or like the figures adults draw 
for children, the kind of images 
children can identify because they 
can draw them — the kind of 
pictures you must draw with a 



blunt crayon or a grid. It looks like 
something intelligible even to the 
unsophisticated.” 

White glanced up, amused. 
“Like me?” 

“Like you. But unlike most stick 
figures, this picture rewards study. 
Much about it still is ambiguous, 
but some of what it means seems 
reasonably clear. In the lower left- 
hand corner is a square four spaces 
to a side; another one is in the 
upper right. Those probably are 
suns.” 

“Two suns?” White said and 
then felt foolish. “Of course. Ca- 
pella has two suns. John told me 
and you told me, but I can’t seem 
to remember things like that.” 

“ ‘My words fly up, my thoughts 
remain below,’ ” MacDonald 
quoted. 

“ ‘Words without thoughts never 
to heaven go,’ ” White continued 
and enjoyed the look of ad- 
miration and new respect in Mac- 
Donald’s glance. 

“Below the symbol in the upper 
right is a smaller square with single 
marks and double marks seemingly 
grouped around it. If a large square 
is a sun, a smaller square is a — ” 

“ — planet,” White supplied. 

“That’s right,” MacDonald said. 

White felt as if he were back in 
school and had just received the 
teacher’s approval. 

“And those single and double

marks,” MacDonald continued, 
“probably are satellites of the big 
planet. Theory suggests that only 
large superjovian planets would be 
able to maintain an orbit in a 
double-sun system. Life on a su- 
perjovian seems unlikely. But a 
superjovian could have earth-sized 
satellites on which an intelligent 
race of creatures could evolve. 
And the Capellan — if that is what 
he is — seems to be pointing with 
two of his, or her, arms — or an 
arm and a wing — toward one of 
the suns, the one in the upper 
right-hand corner, and one of the 
satellites, if that is what they are. 
The implication is: this is its sun 
— not the other, which may be at 
a considerable distance — and this 
is its home world.” 

White nodded. In spite of him- 
self he had become involved. “In- 
genious. Almost like a detective 
story.” He felt MacDonald’s eyes 
on him and realized he was being 
played upon and enjoyed it. 

“We’ve been working at it, 
trying to put together the clues and 
solve the mystery,” MacDonald 
said. “I have an excellent staff, Mr. 
President — dedicated, brilliant, 
much more capable than I. My job 
is to keep them supplied with 
pencils and rubber bands and paper 
clips.” 

“I know that feeling,” White 
said dryly. How much about him 



did MacDonald know? How much 
did he guess? How much was com- 
mon to all administrators? 

MacDonald spoke again, more 
rapidly now, as if hastening to- 
ward a climax. 

“Below the satellites are num- 
bers from one to nine written in a 
binary system, establishing a 
system of counting, the beginning 
of a common mathematics — and 
the fact that the Capellans’ 
intellectual processes are similar to 
ours. Down the left-hand side are 
what appear to be words — num- 
bers on the right, words on the 
left; numbers written horizontal- 
ly, words with a vertical com- 
ponent.” 

“Why words?” 

M acdonald shrugged. 

“We’re still guessing about a 
lot of things. Perhaps they’re 
building a vocabulary for later use 
when a word may be worth at least 
one picture, perhaps words are 
necessary to make a statement in 
the message that we have not yet 
deciphered — perhaps they help 
explain the picture.” 

“What are the words? Can you 
decipher them?” 

MacDonald pointed at the pic- 
ture in White’s hands. “They seem 
to apply to something that is on the 
same line or lines with them. 



138 



GALAXY 




usually to their right. Let’s skip the 
top one for a moment. The next 
one is repeated three times. Two of 
them the Capellan is pointing at 
with his right upper limbs. Perhaps 
they are the Capellan word for 
‘Capellan.’ You will notice that 
the third time the word appears it 
is opposite the dot underneath the 
Capellan, which — if it is not an 
accidental dot or meaningless 
noise — may mean that this, too, is 
a Capellan. Or a Capellan in 
embryo.” He looked at White 
expectantly. 

“An egg?” White ventured. 

“Very likely. It may be trying 
to tell us that it breeds by laying 
eggs.” 

“It’s a bird.” 

“Or a reptile. Or an insect. But 
more likely a bird, which would ex- 
plain the second pair of limbs.” 

“They really are wings?” White 
said. 

“Working wings or vestiges.” 

White glanced at Jeremiah’s 
drawing on MacDonald’s desk and 
back to the framed computer 
readout. He was beginning to see 
how one could become the other, 
how Jeremiah could have seen the 
stick figure as an angel, the square 
thing on its head as a halo. The sit- 
uation became more understand- 
able, though no less serious. 

‘‘And the other words?” he 
asked. 



“These are even more spec- 
ulative,” MacDonald said. “The 
third word may mean wing, the 
fifth, body or chest, the sixth, hips, 
or legs, the seventh, legs or feet. 
They may mean something else 
entirely, refer to function rather 
than parts. Some of these we’re 
filing away until we have sopie 
repetitions.” 

White was startled. “More mes- 
sages are being received?” 

MacDonald shook his head. 
“The same message over and over. 
As if, having attracted our at- 
tention, the Capellans want to tell 
us only the important things about 
themselves and these they want to 
be sure we understand before they 
go on.” 

“Like programed learning,” 
White said. He was relieved that 
there were no more messages, that 
he had to cope with one alien 
communication, one problem, not 
a continuing series. 

“Or maybe,” MacDqnald said, 
“they do not wish to go further, to 
send more messages of whatever 
kind, until they know we are re- 
ceiving them and understand — un- 
til we have replied.” 

White quickly changed the sub- 
ject. “What matters of importance 
are they trying to communicate to 
us?” 

“Who they are. Where they live. 
What they call themselves. How

they reproduce. How they think.” 

“How do they think?” White 
asked. 

“In words and numbers and 
images,” MacDonald replied. 
“The way we do.” 

White studied the picture as if by 
looking at it he could force it to 
yield up its secrets, but it clung to 
them stubbornly. 

“Do they think the same way 
we think — in terms of advantage 
and disadvantage, in terms of 
profit and loss, in terms of victory 
and defeat, in terms of what’s in it 
for me.” 

MacDonald looked at White 
much, White thought, as he had 
been looking at the picture. Mac- 
Donald shook his head. 

“They seem quite peaceful to 
me. All of us don’t think in terms 
of advantage and conflict. In- 
creasingly, I think, we becorqe 
more uncompetitive. And birds al- 
ways have been a symbol of 
peace.” 

“Only the dove,” White said 
gloomily. “Did you ever see a 
bluejay attacking other birds or 
cats or even people? What about 
hawks and eagles and vultures? 
Any creature that becomes the 
dominant species on its world has 
to be aggressive. How does a bird 
think?” 

How does a man think? A per- 



son you have raised within your 
home, within your arms, within 
your love — how does he think? 
How can one reach him, tell him, 
make him see what he is, what the 
world is like? What he wanted to 
say was, ‘'Look, son, you see the 
world as a benign, smiling place of 
peace and opportunity and fair 
play, but it’s not like that. You go 
on thinking it is, and the first 
chance it gets it’s going to bite your 
black ass off” 

And John would say, “Stop talk- 
ing like a nigger. Father. ” 

IV 

117 HITE lifted his eyes from the 
■■ picture in his hands to Mac- 
Donald’s face. “Do you have a 
son?” he asked and, hearing him- 
self say it, realized he had let slip 
something about himself. Not, 
“Do you have any children?” But, 
“Do you have a son?” In an age 
when one child was the norm Mac- 
Donald perhaps would not notice. 

MacDonald’s face softened. 
“Yes,” he said. 

White had gotten through. 

“We’re a lot alike,” White said. 
“That was my son who came in 
with me.” 

“I know,” MacDonald said. 

“He acts as my personal assis- 
tant. He is very much interested in 
your Project.” 



140 



GALAXY 




“I know,” MacDonald said. 

“I wouldn’t know what to do 
without him,” White said and the 
words sounded like a plea in his 
ears. Perhaps it was. 

“My son is only eight months 
old,” MacDonald said. 

White raised his eyebrows and 
MacDonald chuckled. 

“I’ve spent my life waiting,” he 
said. “For him I almost waited too 
long.” 

White thought of MacDonald 
waiting here at the Project among 
all these alien machines with their 
alien smells, listening for a mes- 
sage from the stars that never 
came, listening without results for 
fifty years. Bosh! He was senti- 
mentalizing again. That wasn’t this 
man. The Project itself was fifty 
years old, but MacDonald had 
been with it only twenty years and 
he was an engineer — no doubt he 
liked machines and their smells 
and their meaningless noises. 
Still, twenty years . And now 
the message had come and it 
would never be acknowledged. 
White felt a new flash of sympathy 
for MacDonald and all the people 
who had given their lives to the 
search. 

“You don’t look like a man who 
has been told that his life's work 
can’t be completed,” White said. 

MacDonald smiled. It was the 
kind of patient smile he must have 



maintained throughout the long 
listening. White thought. “I’ve 
waited a long time,” MacDonald 
said. “So have the Capellans. We 
can wait some more if necessary. 
But I hope your decision can be 
changed. You’re still here and 
you’re still listening.” 

“I owe you that,” White said. 
MacDonald waited. He could have 
said. You don’t owe me anything, 
Mr. President. We owe you for 
your sacrifices. White thought 
with fleeting irritation. “Those 
other words,” he said. “The ones 
you passed over — what about 
them?” 

“If those are words at the bot- 
tom,” MacDonald said, pointing 
out the two symbols at the bottom 
of the page beneath the egg, “the 
one in the upper left-hand corner 
is repeated below. It could mean 
sun." 

“And the other word at the bot- 
tom?” 

“We don’t know,” MacDonald 
said. “Perhaps more sun. You will 
notice that the sun at the bottom 
left has rays at each of its corners. 
The one at the top has only a single 
beginning of a ray. Perhaps the 
distant sun is hotter and they’re 
trying to tell us this in case we 
have the astronomical capability 
to distinguish them.” 

White studied the picture again. 
“All that from this?” 



THE ANSWER

“As you said — a detective story. 
We’re detectives hunting for clues 
and we have a great many clues. 
And a great research tool.” He 
waved his hand toward the 
computer room. “Virtually the 
entire written history and litera- 
ture of mankind — in all the writ- 
ten languages — is stored in there. 
Everything we do or say within 
the Project is recorded. It’s that 
kind of computer. It learns and 
compares and translates and 
stores and works cryptograms and 
breaks codes. And, of course, what 
we are working with is not cryp- 
tography but anti-cryptography — 
the designing of a code impossible 
to misunderstand.” 

“Our earlier telephone conversa- 
tion is also recorded?” White 
asked. 

“If we wished, we could recall 
the information upon voice com- 
mand or eliminate it from the 
record upon written command.” 
White waved a hand. “It doesn’t 
matter. What I have done and said 
is a matter of record throughout 
the world and when my term of of- 
fice is over it will all be ferreted 
out by scholars and dissected and 
buried in a library somewhere. 
What I can’t understand is why 
Jeremiah was here?” 

M acdonald grew thought- 
ful. “The Project has not been 



a secret. One of my responsi- 
bilities has been to keep it going 
and one way I have fulfilled that 
responsibility has been to tell peo- 
ple what we were doing, to show 
them what our work meant, how 
important it was.” 

Just as you are doing with me. 
White thought. “Public relations?” 
he said. “Promotion?” 

“Yes,” MacDonald said. 

“Communication?” White sug- 
gested. 

“I like that best,” MacDonald 
said. 

“I do, too,” White admitted. 

John opened the far door. “Mr. 
President,” he said. “We have a 
report from Houston.” 

“Let’s have it,” White said. 

MacDonald pushed a button on 
his desk. 

As the familiar window opened 
in front of them. White said, “I 
hate this stuff.” 

“Me, too,” MacDonald said. 
“It’s a filtered way of seeing and 
hearing — most of the sensory 
clues are missing.” 

White looked at MacDonald in 
mild surprise — then the scene 
came alive. The view was from 
mid-air — perhaps from a hover- 
ing jet — outside the Houston 
temple. Men and women were 
marching back and forth in the 
street, picketing the Prophet. They 
were carrying signs, some pro- 



142 



GALAXY 




testing the Project, decrying the 
message as a hoax, contact with 
aliens a potential calamity. 

So the fat was already in the 
fire. White thought. Jeremiah had 
reached his audience. 

Between the pickets other men 
and women passed and entered the 
building in an irregular but per- 
sistent flow. Beyond the pickets, 
as the view pulled back again, 
silent figures stood massed like a 
low cloud over the street, waiting 
for something — a word, an event, a 
signal. From their appearance it 
was difficult to determine 
whether they were spectators or 
participants waiting for their 
moment. 

The scene changed. Now the 
viewpoint was inside the giant 
dome. The camera locked briefly 
on the distant ceiling, then slow- 
ly panned the seats. Every one was 
filled and more people were sit- 
ting and standing in the aisles. Be- 
low them, in a circle of light, like a 
gleaming stick figure in black and 
white, stood Jeremiah. He was not 
alone. A creature was behind 
him, an evanescent, transparent 
figure — clearly an angel — with 
halo and wings outspread. It 
rested its right hand on Jeremiah’s 
shoulder. 

The stick figure raised his left 
hand to the crowd and the crowd 
came to its feet in one simul- 



taneous movement. White could 
not hear anything — he supposed 
sound accompanied the transmis- 
sion but it was not turned up — yet 
he could feel the shock wave that 
exploded from more than fifty 
thousand throats and shook the 
distant ceiling of the temple. 

“Trouble,” White said as the 
scene faded and MacDonald 
turned it off. White sighed. He did 
not like trouble. Nobody liked 
trouble, perhaps, but Presidents 
liked it least of all. 

“Excitement,” MacDonald com- 
mented. 

“Disturbance, dissension.” 
White frowned. We have solved 
many of the problems that 
threatened to tear this nation apart 
at the time the Project was started. 
Trouble of the kind we just saw will 
keep us from solving the others. 
We need calm, serenity, direction 
and purpose. Jeremiah’s angel and 
your message from the stars are 
diversions — they mean trouble. The 
old problems of the chosen peo- 
ples and the outcasts, the favored 
and the fallen, the elect and the 
non-elect — all these will return. 
This angel of Jeremiah’s brings 
not peace but a sword. I don’t see 
how he could have read that into 
the message.” 

MacDonald picked up a piece of 
illustration board from his 
desk — something else he had

missed, White thought — and held it 
out. 

“I had a staff artist prepare this 
for you. Something comparable 
to what I thought Jeremiah would 
describe.” 



117 HITE accepted it, turned it 
” over, looked at it. It, too, had a 
drawing, but this one was a draw- 
ing of a tall birdlike creature with 
vestigial wings. On its head was a 
transparent helmet. At opposite 
corners of the drawing were 
stylized representations of suns; 
below the one in the upper right- 
hand corner was a Jupiter-like 
planet with four satellites, two 
small ones like the moon and two 
larger ones, one resembling 
Venus, the other Earth-like in pro- 
portion. 

Numbers from one to nine were 
written underneath along the right- 
hand edge. Running down the left- 
hand side were words: sun. Capel- 
lan, wing, Capellan, chest, hips, 
legs, Capellan. And below the 
figure was a large, well-shaped egg; 
below that were two more words: 
sun and hotter sun. 

Through the creature’s trans- 
parent helmet could be seen the 
face of an alien obviously avian in 
evolution but also intelligent. 
The bird looked interested, gentle, 
benevolent .

“I suppose,” White said, “one is 
just as reasonable as the other.” 
“That’s one reason I couldn’t tell 
Jeremiah he was wrong,” 
MacDonald said. “He had Just as 
much a right to his interpreta- 
tion as I to mine.” 

“Your other reason,” White 
said, “was that his acceptance of 
the message was an advantage 
for the Project.” 

MacDonald shrugged. “Cer- 
tainly. Although what- I was try- 
ing to tell him was that the mes- 
sage was no threat to him or his 
religious beliefs. And that is true.” 
White was a little surprised at 
MacDonald’s cynicism, though he 
was seldom surprised by anyone’s 
opportunism. Somehow he had 
been building a different image of 
MacDonald. 

“What you are saying is that 
you allowed him to deceive him- 
self.” 

“No,” MacDonald said stead- 
ily. “We don’t know what the mes- 
sage says. We’re interpreting it on 
a simple mechanistic basis, read- 
ing it at a kind of childish, stick- 
figure level. Jeremiah is inter- 
preting it on a more adult scale, 
translating symbols into images. 
The two drawings — ours and Jere- 
miah’s — are of roughly equal 
value. The only reality we have is 
the computer grid.” 

White said softly, “Such a small

bance.” believe is the substance of the

scientists of the world supply 
their interpretations, let us come 
up with an answer and transmit it 
to the Capellans — ” 

White looked at the drawing in 
his hand. He did not answer 
MacDonald directly. “Do you 
have a pencil?” he asked. “Or a 
crayon or pen?” 

MacDonald rummaged in his 
desk and produced a broad-tipped 
pen. White worked over the face of 
the bird for a moment and then 
handed the illustration board to 
MacDonald. 

Now the bird was no longer 
humanoid. Its beak was longer and 
curved at the end, a beak made for 
biting and tearing. The bird’s eyes 
were hooded and cruel. It was a 
bird of prey looking for its next 
meal. 

“What if it really looks like 
that?” White asked. 

“The question,” he should have 
said, “is what is the world really 
like? Is it as you see it or as I know 
it? If some doubt remains about 
the answer — wouldn’t it be better 
to consider the past, to learn the 
history of your people, to be 
black until you are certain the 
present has changed its old ways, 
its old habits of mind?” 

But he had said instead, “By 
God, I know the world, John, and 
you don't. You’ve got to take my 



word for it if you can’t see for your- 
self” 

And John had told him, “The 
past is irrelevant.” 

But even that was a statement 
out of the past. 

T ime was running out. White 
felt. Soon he would have to 
terminate this conversation and 
decide what to do about the 
trouble that was coming, that he 
could feel in his hips. But he hated 
to cut off this man — this good man, 
he thought — until he was satis- 
fied. 

“What difference can it make,” 
MacDonald was saying, “forty- 
five light years away? They want to 
communicate. They’re looking 
for other minds, for intelligent 
fellow creatures in the universe.” 
“But why?” White asked. “Why 
go to all the trouble?” 

“So they won’t be alone. For the 
same reason we’ve listened. So we 
wouldn’t be alone. It is a terrible 
thing to be alone. Besides, they al- 
ready know we’re here.” 

“What?” White asked, sur- 
prised, a little alarmed. 

“The voices,” MacDonald said. 
The voices. Of course. The aliens 
had picked up the old radio broad- 
casts, so they knew there were peo- 
ple at the other end. 

“They don’t know who we are or 
what we are,” White said. “They 



146 



GALAXY 




don’t know whether we have re- 
ceived their message or whether 
we have deciphered it or whether 
we will respond to it — or whether 
we can do any of these things.” 
MacDonald put his fingertips to- 
gether. “Does it matter?” 

White shrugged a bit impatient- 
ly. “You and your colleagues are 
the experts on aliens and on alien 
potentials, but even a layman 
can imagine a situation in which it 
might matter.” 

MacDonald smiled. “The bogy- 
man from the stars?” 

“There are bogymen,” White 
said. “The tribe from the east or 
the north. The bad men from the 
hills. The lynch mob from the vil- 
lage.” 

“None of them civilized,” 
MacDonald said. “None of them 
trying to communicate.” 

“I can find examples of that, 
too. Maybe the Capellans are 
signaling a number of different 
worlds, and they will determine 
which one to invade according to 
which one responds.” 

“Even if interstellar travel is 
possible — which it probably is not; 
even if interstellar warfare is 
possible — which it almost cer- 
tainly is not,” MacDonald said, 
“even then, why would they want 
to invade another world?” 

White spread his hands. “Why 
did they expend the effort to 



signal us in the first place?” 
MacDonald started to speak but 
White continued. “ ‘Dear Miss 
Lonelyhearts, I have been waiting 
here for a million years . .’ Per- 
haps they need to be sure we have 
not ruined our planet with radio- 
activity since we discovered radio. 
Perhaps they intend to send us in- 
structions for constructing a mat- 
ter transmitter. Perhaps they re- 
quire a certain level of technology 
from us to make us worthwhile as 
a subject world.” 

“If all this were possible,” 
MacDonald said, “then we must 
also remember that they have put 
themselves and their world in our 
hands as much as we would put 
ourselves in theirs by replying to 
their communication. That 
demonstrates a certain amount of 
trust.” 

“Or confidence. Or arrogance.” 

“I cannot believe — ” MacDon- 
ald began. 

“But can you conceive?” White 
broke in. “You have spent your life 
among scholarly men of good will. 
To you the universe is a benevo- 
lent place — it has treated you with 
kindness or at least neutrality. I 
have seen passion and malice and 
greed and I know that intelligence 
is not necessarily benevolent. In 
fact, in my experience it is more 
likely to be merely an instrument 
in the persistent search for ad-

vantage, in weighing profit and 
loss and finding a means of maxi- 
mizing profit and minimizing loss.” 

V 

1^ ACDONALD did not respond 
as White had expected. “Logic 
is our assurance,” MacDonald said 
calmly. “The only thing worth 
sending from star to star is in- 
formation and the certain profit 
from such an exchange far out- 
weighs the uncertain advantage 
from any other kind of behavior. 
The first benefit is the awareness 
that other intelligent creatures 
exist in our universe — this alone 
gives at least some of us strength 
and courage. Next, receiving in- 
formation from an alien world 
could be like having our own in- 
struments there, perhaps even our 
own scientists to measure and re- 
cord, but with the additional ad- 
vantage of a breadth and duration 
of measurements under a variety 
of conditions. Finally come the 
cultural and scientific knowledge 
and development of another race, 
and the treasure to be gained from 
this kind of exchange is beyond 
calculation.” 

White changed his approach. 
“What if it changes us? We have 
seen problems of cultural shock, 
when a more advanced culture 



meets a more primitive one. Some 
of the societies that have gone 
through it here on Earth have dis- 
integrated. Some have become 
slaves. The ones that survived did 
so by changing their values, atti- 
tudes and behavior.” 

MacDonald studied White as if 
estimating his ability to under- 
stand. “I should think you would 
not find conditions so perfect that 
you would not welcome change.” 

“I welcome my kind of change.” 
“Besides,” MacDonald said, 
“any examples of cultural shock 
would have to include societies 
that are unsophisticated or iso- 
lated, that could not imagine any- 
thing superior to themselves, even 
anything different — ” 

“As a tearful old medicine man 
once said to Carl Jung,” White 
said, as if he were remembering, 
“we might find ourselves without 
dreams.” 

, “We are not so naive,” 
MacDonald said. “We know that 
there are other intelligent beings 
in the universe; we know that they 
will be different from us and at 
least some of us hunger for the ex- 
change. Our dreams are of space- 
flight and alien contact — an en- 
tire literature has developed it, 
and our myths reinforce it with 
their flying saucers and visita- 
tions. We have been listening now 
for fifty years and people are pre-

pared to hear something. They are 
psychologically ready for contact. 
Now they know we have been con- 
tacted. They have heard the voices 
and they have seen one version of 
the message — ” 

John opened the door again. 
“More information coming in, 
Mr. President.” 

MacDonald looked at White. 
White nodded and MacDonald 
pressed a button. 

The first scene showed police 
battling a mob outside the 
Solitarian Temple. Stains could be 
seen on the streets when the con- 
flict swirled an opening into view. 
Bodies could be seen, too, and 
some of the bodies wore uniforms. 
Men and women were streaming 
out of the cathedral, trying to get 
through the battle — or join it. 

MacDonald turned up the 
sound. The conflict rumbled like 
distant thunder. 

The second scene revealed a 
smaller mob in the street in front of 
a neo-classical building; around 
it, like a moat, a reflecting pool 
kept the mob at a distance. But 
there were shouts in a language 
other than English and raised fists. 

The third, fourth and fifth scenes 
were similar — the only variations 
were the architectural styles of the 
buildings, the color and dress of 
the mob and the language of the 
shouts. 



The sixth scene showed a group 
of people, men, women, and chil- 
dren, gathered on a dark hilltop 
around a man in dark robes. They 
were looking up at the stars in 
silence. 

The seventh scene revealed 
something fleshy, bloody and 
visceral spread out on pavement 
like an abstract painting. The 
view tilted up the side of the build- 
ing until it reached the distant 
concrete peak. 

The eighth scene showed ambu- 
lances pulling up to a hospital 
emergency entrance. 

The ninth scene was a morgue. 

The tenth scene revealed an im- 
penetrable traffic snarl as cars and 
copters tried to leave a city. 

What would John be like in the 
kind of world White knew, the kind 
of world that existed out there? 
John had not been exposed to mob 
passions, violence, ignorance and 
prejudice. White had wanted to 
spare his son the kind of hurt that 
he had felt, the kind of bitterness 
that even now twisted his guts in 
secret sorrow. His actions had not 
been a kindness, but rather a mis- 
taken sentimentality that was now 
turning on him. Even the basic 
political facts, the kinds of bar- 
gaining and trades that politics 
forced on a man, he had shielded 
John from; he had not wanted his

son to be touched by that kind of 
pitch. Or was it that he did not 
want his son to know what made 
his father’s skin black? 

To be black — and without a son? 

HEY don’t understand,” 
^ MacDonald said. “They’re 
reacting out of fear.” 

White took a deep breath. It was 
a habit when he was forced to make 
a decision, as if he could draw in 
the situation and force it down to 
where his decisions were made. 
Soon he would have to make a 
statement, commit himself in a 
way he could never review, un- 
leash forces he could never recall. 

“It seems,” he said quietly, “like 
the start of something — religious 
riots, perhaps, even a religious 
war — or the end of something.” 
“People are reacting to lack of 
information,” MacDonald said. 
“Let us communicate with them. 
People are uncertain. An of- 
ficial announcement and a 
planned campaign of information 
about the Project and the message 
and the answer — ” 

“Might ease the fears,” White 
said, “or reinforce them.” 

“The fears are not logicaL Facts 
will dispel them. The Capellans 
cannot come here. Matter trans- 
mission is fantasy and we cannot 
imagine any kind of propulsion 
system that could enable any life 



form even to approach the speed 
of light.” 

“What we cannot imagine,” 
White said, “has had a habit of 
coming true the last few cen- 
turies. And what was considered 
impossible by one generation be- 
came the next generation’s com- 
monplace. Tell me — why do you 
insist on replying to this mes- 
sage? Isn’t it enough that your 
search has been successful, that 
you have demonstrated the exis- 
tence of intelligent life in the uni- 
verse?” 

“I could give you rationaliza- 
tions,” MacDonald said. “There 
are many good reasons — I have 
given you the most important 
one: communication between 

aliens could result in incalculable 
benefits to both — but behind all 
the rationalizations, as you sus- 
pect, is the personal motivation. I 
will be dead before our answer can 
reach Capella but I want my ef- 
forts to be rewarded, my con- 
victions to be proved correct, my 
life to have been meaningful. Just 
as you do.” 

“We come down to funda- 
mentals at last,” White said. 

“Always. I wish to leave a legacy 
to my son and to the world. I’m 
not a poet, a prophet, an artist, a 
builder, a statesman or a philan- 
thropist. All I can leave is an open 
door. An open line to the universe.

GALAXY 




hope, the prospect of something 
new — ” 

“We all want that,” White said. 

“Not all of us,” MacDonald 
said. “Some of us wish to pass on 
our hatreds, our battles — not 
something new but something 
old. I want to give my children the 
future, not the past. The past is not 
irrelevant, but we can’t live there. 
Believe me: once the answer is 
sent, peace will come to the 
world.” 

“Why then?” 

“For one thing, it will be done, 
over. The people who are quar- 
reling now will realize that they are 
human beings — that the real dif- 
ferences lie out there. That if we 
can communicate with unearthly 
life forms — why shouldn’t we com- 
municate with each other across 
mere language and cultural bar- 
riers — ” 

John said, “The Chinese Am- 
bassador is calling, Mr. Presi- 
dent,” and White realized that he 
had been so involved in MacDon- 
ald’s argument that he had not no- 
ticed the door’s opening. 

“I don’t have my translator with 
me,” he said. 

“Don’t worry,” MacDonald 
said. “The computer will take care 
ofit.” 

AFTER White and MacDonald 
^had changed places White found 



himself behind MacDonald’s desk, 
staring into the window. The 
Chinese face above the colorful 
tunic said, in English, with almost 
exact lip synchronization, “Mr. 
President, my country respect- 
fully requests that you control the 
disturbances within your borders, 
and that you cease the provocative 
news announcements threaten- 
ing the peace of friendly nations.” 

“You may tell your premier,” 
White said carefully, “that we 
regret these disturbances more 
than anyone, that we hope to bring 
them under control soon and that 
we have no mechanism for con- 
trolling news announcements, as 
he has.” 

The sleek Chinese head nodded 
politely. “My country also re- 
quests that you make no answer to 
the message you have received 
from Capella, now or in the 
future.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor,” White said politely, but be- 
fore he could turn to MacDonald 
the Chinese face was replaced by a 
Russian. 

“The Russian Ambassador,” 
John said. 

“The Soviet Union is greatly dis- 
turbed by the suppression of this 
message,” the Russian said 
brusquely. “We wish you to know 
that we, too, have received the 
message and are composing a re-

ply to it. We will announce this 
shortly.” 

And the window was empty and 
shimmering. 

“No more,” White said. The 
window winked out. He put his 
hands on the desk. It was a good, 
solid working surface, not a cere- 
monial piece of furniture like his 
desk in the White House, and he 
felt as if he could work here. Here, 
seated in MacDonald’s chair, look- 
ing at MacDonald, he felt as if 
their roles had been reversed, as if 
he were in charge here. 

“I think you knew about the 
Russians and the Chinese,” White 
said. 

“The fraternity of science is 
closer than the fraternity of birth- 
place or commonmother tongue.” 

“How did they learn about the 
message?” 

MacDonald spread his hands in 
a gesture of helplessness. “Too 
many people knew about it. If I 
had suspected that we would not 
be permitted to release the infor- 
mation as a matter of course, that 
there would be any question about 
our replying, I would not have as- 
sembled my people for our mo- 
ment of triumph. But once the 
word was out the information 
could not be entirely suppressed. 
We were not a secret project. We 
were a scientific laboratory 
committed to sharing our find- 



ings with the world. Why, we even 
have some Chinese and Russian 
exchange scientists working 
with us. At this late date — ” 

“Nobody thought you would 
succeed,” White said. 

MacDonald looked at White in 
surprise. It was the first time 
White had seen MacDonald sur- 
prised at anything. 

“Then why did you fund us?” 
MacDonald asked. 

“I don’t know why the Project 
was started,” White said. “I 
haven’t looked up its historical 
origins and perhaps the real an- 
swer isn’t there, anyway. But I 
suspect that the answer is much 
the same as our rationalization 
over the past few years: it was 
something scientists wanted to 
do and nobody saw any harm in it. 
After all, we live in the age of wel- 
fare.” 

“Public welfare,” MacDonald 
corrected. 

“Welfare of all kinds,” White 
said. “This nation — and other na- 
tions, some of them before us, 
some of them after us — set out on 
a conscious policy of elimin- 
ating poverty and injustice.” 

“The function of government is 
‘to promote the general wel- 
fare,’ ” MacDonald said. 

“It is also a deliberate policy. 
Poverty and injustice are evils, 
but they are endurable evils in a 



152 



GALAXY 




world where other problems are 
greater. They are not endurable 
in a complex, technological so- 
ciety where cooperation is es- 
sential, where violence and riot- 
ing can destroy a city, even civili- 
zation itself.” 

‘‘Of course.” 

‘‘So we turned ourselves around 
and set this nation to the task of 
eliminating poverty and injus- 
tice — and we have done it. We have 
established a stable social sys- 
tem where everyone has a guar- 
anteed annual income and can do 
pretty much what he pleases ex- 
cept procreate without limit or 
harm others in other ways.” 

MacDonald nodded. “That has 
been the great accomplishment 
of the past few decades — the wel- 
fare movement.” 

“Except we don’t call it welfare 
any more,” White said. “It’s de- 
mocracy, the system, the way 
things are, what people are en- 
titled to. What makes you think 
that science is not part of the sys- 
tem?” 

“It opens the door to change.” 

W^OT if it is unsuccessful,” 
White said. “Or if it is suc- 
cessful in certain limited, predict- 
able ways as in the space program. 
God knows we thought the Project 
was safe enough. Certainly it’s part 
of the welfare program, and the 

THE ANSWER 



diversion of public funds to sup- 
port it over the years has been a 
dole to the scientists to keep them 
busy and out of mischief. The 
important task of government, 
you see, is to keep conditions 
stable, to hold down disturbances 
and unrest, to maintain itself — and 
the best way to accomplish these 
ends is to give everybody the op- 
portunity to do what he or she 
wants — except change things. 
Don’t tell me you haven’t sus- 
pected this all along, that you 
haven’t used it.” 

“No,” MacDonald said — and 
then, “yes. I guess so. I knew that 
if we made difficulties it would 
be easier to get money. I guess 
I realized certain facts without 
facing them squarely. And now 
you want us to stop, just like that.” 

“Not just like that,” White said 
kindly. “Wind it down. Pretend 
to be considering an answer. 
Keep searching for other mes- 
sages. Set up another project 
somewhere — to do something. 
You’ve had experiences. Put 
your mind to it. You’ll know what 
to do.” 

But the battle against injustice 
and poverty was not won, White 
knew. John thought it was — he 
thought he could be discharged 
from duty. But his attitude meant 
desertion. That was what White 



153 




had called John: “Deserter. ” 

Welfare wasn’t enough. Too 
many blacks were satisfied with 
their guaranteed, annuals, were 
unwilling or afraid to compete 
for more. They had to be edu- 
cated. They had to be led. They 
needed figures like himself to 
model themselves after, sym- 
bols such as John could be if he 
stayed in politics. Oh, there were 
other models — black scientists, 
black doctors, black artists, even 
some black members of the Pro- 
ject. But not yet enough — the per- 
centages still said that inequali- 
ty was a reality. 

He had presided over the wel- 
fare state, but he hadn’t thought 
welfare would get John. 

MacDonald was thoughtful as if 
he were weighing something deep 
inside himself. 

Does he think in his hips like 
Teddy and me? 

“I’ve spent my life in search of 
truth,” MacDonald said. “I can’t 
lie now.” 

White sighed. “Then we’ll have 
to find someone who can.” 

“It won’t work. The scientific 
community will act, when sup- 
pressed, the same way as any oth- 
er minority.” 

“We must have tranquility.” 

“In a technological world,” 
MacDonald said, “change in in- 



evitable. What you must have for 
tranquility is reasonable change, 
manageable change.” 

“And the change the message 
brings is unmanageable, incal- 
culable.” 

“That’s because you have not al- 
lowed us to manage it — I don’t 
like that word — you haven’t let us 
communicate our reality to 
the people, explain it to them in 
such a way they see it as an adven- 
ture, as a promise, as a gift of un- 
derstanding and awareness and 
information and insight yet to 
be delivered. Besides, how can 
you know what the world or this 
nation will need ninety years 
from now?” 

“Ninety years?” White laughed 
shakily. “I think no farther ahead 
than the next election. What do 
ninety years have to do with any of 
this?” 

“That is the length of time it will 
take an answer to reach Capella 
and for their reply to come to us,” 
MacDonald said. “Those ninety 
years are what I meant when I said 
I wanted to leave a legacy for my 
son — and his son. Why, by the time 
our answer reaches Capella you 
and I will be dead, Mr. President. 
Most of the people now alive will 
be dead; your son will be elderly 
and my son will be middle-aged. 
And by the time the response 
reaches us from Capella, virtual- 



154 



GALAXY 




ly everyone now alive will be dead. 
What we do we do not for our- 
selves but for future generations. 
We bequeath you,” MacDonald 
said softly, “a message from the 
stars.” 

“Ninety years,” White re- 
peated. “What kind of communi- 
cation is that?” 

“As soon as people under- 
stand,” MacDonald said confi- 
dently, “the disturbances will 
disappear. Fear, anger, hatred, 
distrust — these don’t last. Tran- 
quility can last — and tranquili- 
ty will return — along with a vague 
sense of something pleasant that 
may happen in the indefinite fu- 
ture, like the promised land — not 
now, not tomorrow, but some 
time. And those who threaten the 
tranquility, from nation to in- 
dividual, consciously threaten a 
definite future good — and will 
refrain.” 

VI 

117HITE looked around the bare 
■■ room once more, small, sim- 
ple place where a man had worked 
for twenty years and left few 
marks behind. Perhaps, he 
thought, MacDonald had left his 
mark elsewhere — on people, on 
ideas, on a project, on the 
stars — and he still felt that sense of 
unease in his hips that said No, 



this is wrong. and he felt sorry 
for everybody and hoped that his 
discomfort was not caused mere- 
ly by the fact that he was not an in- 
tellectual, because he felt un- 
comfortable with ideas, because 
he could not think in terms of cen- 
turies. 

“I can’t take the chance,” he 
said. “You will not send an an- 
swer. You will begin the disman- 
tling of the Project. Can you do 
it?” 

He stood up. The discussion 
was over. 

MacDonald rose thoughtfully. 
“Is there nothing I can say to 
change your mind?” 

White shook his head. “You 
have said it all. Believe me, you 
have done everything any man 
could do.” 

“I know what kind of legacy I 
wish to leave my son,” MacDon- 
ald said. “What kind of legacy do 
you wish to leave yours?” 

White looked at him sadly. 
“That’s unfair. I do what I must. 
Will you do what you must?” 

MacDonald sighed. White saw 
the life go out of him and felt sad. 

“Let me handle it my way,” 
MacDonald said. “We will con- 
tinue to study the message, con- 
tinue to riddle its meaning. 
Gradually I will shift the listen- 
ing to other locations.” 

“You want a chance to wait me

out?” White said. “You hope for 
better luck with my successor?” 

“Our time scale is different. 
The Project can wait.” 

“You have in me,” White said, 
“someone who still believes in 
change. My successor will be- 
lieve in none, and his successor 
will want to take conditions 
back.” He shrugged with regret 
and held out his hand to be shak- 
en, protecting automatically 
the way he had learned to do in 
campaigning. “But perhaps your 
way is best. Keep hoping. Keep 
your Project going. Keep your 
men working. But do not — I will 
put this in writing immediately 
even though it has been recorded 
by your computer — do not send 
an answer. I have my own men on 
your project and they will have 
their instructions.” 

MacDonald hesitated and then 
took White’s hand. “I’m sorry,” he 
said. 

White didn’t know why Mac- 
Donald was sorry. Perhaps he 
was sorry that he had to preside 
over the betrayal of the Project. 
Perhaps he was sorry for a Presi- 
dent who had to compromise 
himself and his country’s ideals. 
Perhaps he even mourned for the 
human race, for whom there 
would be no more messages from 
the stars. He might even feel un- 
happy for the Capellans who 



would receive no answer to their 
hopeful message. 

“I never asked you,” White said, 
“what you would have answered if 
you had been permitted to send an 
answer.” 

MacDonald reached past White 
and picked up the last sheet of pa- 
per of his desk. He handed it to 
White.

paused, added: “Anticryptogra-

Bernard Oliver suggested some- 
thing like this more than fifty years 
ago. It tries to tell the Capellans 
pretty much what they told us; 
who we are, where we live, what 
we call ourselves, how we breed, 
how we think.” 

White looked at the paper. 
“You’re holding it sideways,” 
MacDonald said. “We had to 
stretch it out the other way to keep 
the same grid dimensions.” 

White turned the sheet of paper 
around and looked at it for sever- 
al seconds. He began to laugh. 

After a few moments, Mac- 
Donald asked, “What’s funny?” 



White’s laughter stopped as 
quickly as it had begun. He wiped 
his eyes and blew his nose. “I’m 
sorry,” he said. “I wasn’t laughing 
at the answer. I don’t begin to un- 
derstand half of what’s here. But 
that’s obviously a father and a 
mother and child — and the Capel- 
lans would have no way of know- 
ing whether they were white or 
black.” 



What would the President say 
to his son John when he and John 
returned to Washington? That he 
had ordered a great man to hide

his greatness, to destroy what he 
had built? White knew what the ac- 
knowledgment would do to John, 
what it would do to their relation- 
ship. 

“It’s only your own vision you 
can see,” John would say. “You 
are blind to others’ visions.” 

What if John were right? What if 
the revolution were over and the 
rest was now up to the individ- 
ual? Maybe the important bat- 
tle now was to allow individual 
greatness once more to be ex- 
pressed — to open up society 
again? 

What was it John had said? 
White remembered. He remem- 
bered too well. 

“Politics is dead. Father,” John 
had said. “Don’t you understand 
that? Why do you think they let 
you be President? Being Presi- 
dent doesn’t matter any more.” 

r|1 HE speakers on either side of 
^ the room were saying, “Mac! 
Mac!” 

“Yes, Oley,” MacDonald said. 

“John White had just had an 
idea about the message,” the 
speakers said. “I hate to break in 
on your conference, but I don’t 
think it ought to wait.” 

“That’s all right,” MacDonald 
said, glancing questioningly at 
White. “We were just finishing.” 

Almost before the words had 



faded, a stocky, sandy-haired, mid- 
dle-aged man was in the room. 
John followed him. 

“Olsen,” MacDonald said, 
“this is—” 

“I know,” the other said. “Mr. 
President,” he said, giving it the 
least possible break in the flow of 
his enthusiasm. “It falls into 
place like the last piece of a puz- 
zle.” 

White looked at his son. John 
was clearly pleased and excited 
but reluctant to speak. 

“Is this your idea?” White asked 
skeptically. “Really your idea?” 

John nodded. “Yes.” 

“You tell them,” Olsen said, 
turning to John. 

“You,” John said. 

Olsen turned back to MacDon- 
ald. 

“The symbols for the two suns 
were different, right?” he asked, 
speaking rapidly, not waiting for 
an answer. “The sun in the upper 
right-hand corner had a single 
mark extending from it. The one 
in the lower left had two marks at 
each corner, like rays. The words 
in the upper left and at the bot- 
tom to the right of the lower sun 
seem to be the symbol for sun.” 

“Yes,” MacDonald said, look- 
ing at White and then back at Ol- 
sen. 

“And the next symbol at the 
bottom we interpreted as more 



158 



GALAXY 




sun, or bigger sun, or hotter sun. I 
was showing it to John and he 
said, ‘Maybe that isn’t just an idle 
description. Maybe it’s the an- 
swer to another question about 
themselves they want us to 
know — namely what’s happen- 
ing to them? Maybe the distant 
sun is increasing its energy out- 
put, radiating more heat, possi- 
bly turning nova.’ ” 

‘,‘What does that mean?” White 
asked. He was asking the ques- 
tion of anyone, but he was look- 
ing at John. His voice was trou- 
bled, he realized, and he didn’t 
know why. And then he thought 
that to have the sun change in the 
sky was a basic alteration in the 
scheme of things that would be 
frightening beyond terror. He 
tried to imagine what it would be 
like on Earth if the sun began to 
glow brighter, hotter. What 
would men do? Would they tell 
other intelligent races in the uni- 
verse about themselves? Or would 
they hide? 

MacDonald was saying some- 
thing. “ . which may explain the 
helmets, if that is what they are. 
Perhaps they have to wear the hel- 
mets — and protective suits as 
well — whenever they go outside. 
To keep out the heat.” 

“I’m sorry,” White said. “What 
did you say?” 

“The temperature increase 



from the more distant sun,” Mac- 
Donald said, “may not be a great 
problem. But now their sun — the 
sun the superjovian planet or- 
bits around — show signs of going 
nova as well.” 

“They’re going to die,” White 
said. 

“Yes,” MacDonald said. 

IITHITE realized that MacDon- 
■■ aid believed it, the man called 
Oley believed it, John believed it — 
they were convinced that what even 
White had surmised was true, 
mourned the Capellans as if they 
were friends. Perhaps they were: 
MacDonald had lived with them in 
anticipation for twenty years now. 
And now that he had found them, 
had communicated with them, he 
had discovered that they were 
doomed. 

“The message carries no sug- 
gestion of an attempt to escape,” 
MacDonald said. “The helmet, if 
that is what it is, could imply an 
acceptance of conditions as they 
exist — strange we didn’t wonder 
immediately — why helmets on 
their home planet? Escape by 
spaceship may be possible for a 
few, perhaps — they surely must 
have developed spaceflight with 
other satellites of the superjovian 
so close — but no ships are sug- 
gested in the message. Perhaps their 
philosophy breeds acceptance.” 



THE ANSWER 



159 




“They’re going to die,” White 
said again. 

“That changes the situation,” 
John said. “You feel it, don’t you. 
Father?” 

“We can’t go there any more 
than they can come here,” Mac- 
Donald said. “We can’t help them, 
but we can let them know that they 
did not live in vain, that their last 
great effort to communicate 
was successful.” 

He picked up the answer he had 
shown White and with the broad- 
tipped pen sketched, over the head 
of the child the head, shoulders 
and upper torso of a Capellan 
arm in arm with the humans. 

White looked at the picture and 
considered the question, but he 
knew in his hips what the answer 
was. The public would accept this 
message — it would please the peo- 
ple and the exchange would en- 
large their vision and their under- 
standing, bring them closer to- 
gether, give them courage and a 
belief in themselves. 

“Yes,” he said. “Send it.” 

Later, as he and John stood at 
the entrance of the building, he 
realized that John was hanging 
back. 

“What is it, son?” 

“I’d like to stay for a while,” 
John said. “I’d like to find out 
what I would have to do to join the 
Project, to be able to contribute 



something.” He hesitated and 
then he added: “If it’s all right. 
Dad.” 

Something tightened inside 
White’s chest and then slowly 
went away like ice melting. 

“Of course, son,” he said, “if 
that’s what you want to do.” 

In a moment John was gone and 
White looked out across the phos- 
phorescent white parking lot to 
where a slowly moving radio tele- 
scope was outlined against the 
night sky, held aloft on an arm like 
a searchlight ready to be turned 
on, ready to pierce the night with 
its brilliance and thrust its way to 
the stars. 

Some time soon the answer to a 
message from the stars would be 
flung out wave after wave, on its 
long journey to a distant world. 
Or if not from this particular an- 
tenna, some other. 

He imagined it going now and 
tried to feel in his hips that he was 
right, but he was not sure. He 
hoped he was right — right for 
John, right for the black people, 
right for his country, right for all 
humanity now and to come, 
right for intelligent life every- 
where. And his vision fled out- 
ward and upward into the infin- 
ite where there were other crea- 
tures incredibly different from 
him and he thought they said, 
“Well done, Andrew White.” ★

TAD CRAWFORD 





M arlowe attached the his- 
tory hypnocord again. His 
brown eyes began to fall out of fo- 
cus and the lines ground deep into 
his face softened. 



. Earth Union now em- 
pired over four hundred hab- 
itable planets and eighty-two 
billion humans. The empire, 
however, like many which 
had preceeded it, failed to re- 
turn riches in excess of its 
costs. The impoverishment of 
Earth brought military thanes 
to power in the subdivisions 
of the Earth Union. For two 
centuries the threat of a war 
of extinction was constantly 
with man. The deadlock was 
shattered by the sudden ap- 
pearance of the Wagerers, a 
religious-political cult. From 
a small nucleus the cult 
spread rapidly through 
Earth’s homogeneous popu- 
lation. Fatalistic, the cult 
used games of chance to rep- 
resent fate in individual and 
political relations. This cul- 
minated with Ultimate’s cre- 
ation of a four-dimensional 
gambling matrix and its in- 
stallation in all ESP enter- 
tainment units . 



The hypnocord, directed by a 
quick arrow of consciousness, 
switched itself off. Awareness of 



the exterior world reentered 
Marlowe’s mind. He rose, a man 
close to forty, his body leanly 
strong. His height was medium, 
yet he almost touched the ceiling 
of his small, featureless cubicle. 
It had been designed to his size 
specifications or, rather, to the 
size specifictions of millions of 
slaves his size. His hair was thick, 
its blackness speckled at the tem- 
ples with gray. In his face were 
deep grooves of lines, craters of 
Mars, showing the tired hopeless- 
ness of the slave. Yet the lines 
showed more — a fierceness un- 
subdued, a determination. He 
opened a wall panel and pressed a 
button. The hypnocord receded 
into the wall. Another button 
opened a viewscreen. 

“Financial accounts of Mar- 
lowe, owned by sub-Ultimate 
A-Forty-one.” Marlowe spoke in 
a firm voice. Immediately a bal- 
ance sheet appeared on the screen. 

“Marlowe net equity three hun- 
dred and five standard units,’’ a 
mechanical voice intoned. 

Marlowe pressed a button and a 
wall panel covered the screen. He 
considered the number — 305. 
His lifetime’s savings. It could 
purchase a cubicle ten times as 
large as the one he occupied even 
on overcrowded Earth. It could 
purchase a pleasure slave, per- 
haps two. If he were willing to go 
to the stars he could be a substan- 
tial landowner. Despite being a 
slave to the robot A41, he could 



162 



GALAXY 




still own robots of the lesser or- 
ders. 305 units invested in an 0- 
series robot would bring him an 
income for life. 

There was one thing, however, 
305 units could not buy. That was 
Marlowe’s freedom. 

A mind probe came at Mar- 
lowe, quick and unannounced as 
always. He put up no shield, for to 
do so was illegal, but a picture 
formed in his mind of a pleasure 
robot — android, feminine. The 
probe slipped off and returned to 
A41. Marlowe made no sign to in- 
dicate he had noticed the probe, 
but as soon as it was gone the pic- 
ture of the pleasure robot van- 
ished from his mind. The surface 
of his mind was open, yet every 
fiber of his body hid his real de- 
sires from A41. 

Marlowe’s father had been a 
Wagerer — who had not been? 
Marlowe’s father had gambled 
away his wealth first, then his 
wages, his possessions, finally, 
his freedom. There were no free 
men any more. The four-dimen- 
sional game addicted humans to 
gambling. It had a fascination 
far beyond the dull life of beehive 
cubicles and uniform luxury. It 
was. 

Marlowe broke away from this 
train of thought. Only one ques- 
tion existed in his mind — could he 
win? Men did win. No men went 
free but some won planets, wo- 
men, solar systems. Ultimate 
was a benevolent master, al- 



lowed his slaves to own and alien- 
ate property and seldom tasked 
them with service. And if he 
reached the final stage and could 
gamble to have any wish 
granted — what might he win? 

H e pressed a button and the 
ESP chair slid out from opened 
wall panels. In front of it was a 
metal desk surface with a key- 
board. Marlowe seated himself. 

Your name? The voice came 
from within Marlowe. 

“Marlowe.” Marlowe answered 
without words. 

Owner? 

A-Forty-one. 

Place your wager. 

Marlowe looked at the key- 
board before him. He could wa- 
ger up to ten figures. He pressed 
three digits. 

Your wager is 300 units? the 
voice demanded. 

“Yes.” 

Marlowe felt a spinning in his 
mind, a dissipation of his physi- 
cal place-sense. His mind seemed a 
gray swirling mist, a forming uni- 
verse. 

He had left it. It had been warm, 
water about a volcano, air heated 
by the sun. It had been safe, a place 
without hunger, with air easy to 
breathe. 

He wanted to reach out to touch 
but he had no arms. He felt as if he 
could have arms but instead there 



GAMBLER 



163 




were only nubs, the beginning of 
limbs, the buds of arms. 

He lay in one place. His vision 
perceptors were blinded by the 
light. But how did he move? 
No — where should he move? 

He felt something formative 
ahead of him. The new environ- 
ment changed his consciousness. 
Yet he also felt danger. Where he 
had come from was safety. He 
could go back. It was warm 
there — in the water or air. Here it 
was cold and dangerous. 

The Marlowe being moved for- 
ward painfully, its progress slow. 
Every so often it would try to 
stand and fall prone again. It slid 
on its white stomach, its dorsal 
side to the old atmosphere. It 
moved toward consciousness. 

You have won. The voice spoke 
without inflection. 

In the white-walled cubicle 
Marlowe nodded. 

Will you continue? asked the 
voice. 

“Yes.” Marlowe responded in 
his mind. Another probe reached 
into his brain. It found there an 
image of an entire planet, all 
owned by Marlowe. When the 
probe left his mind, Marlowe let 
the image fragment and slip away. 
So he thought, they wonder what 
I’m gambling for. 

The glow had come when it 
should not have. It had no explan- 
ation. No sounds of instinct could 



be matched with it. It was greater 
than any light. It was colored like 
the water that seeped up from a 
wound. 

Marlowe being shivered to hear 
the cries of fear about him. In- 
stinctual, unworded, inherited, 
desperate. The trees of the forest 
were huge, the redness engulfed 
them, blackened them, toppled 
them. The forest trees had never 
toppled before. The jagged white 
light had never made redness be- 
fore. No redness had ever been so 
warm before. 

Marlowe being’s fur matted with 
fear, his black eyes glistened. He 
could flee and be safe. His legs 
were limber, his arms could swing 
him to safety. 

Marlowe being scurried toward 
the redness. A patch lay hot be- 
fore him on the ground. He chat- 
tered wildly, saying nothing but 
unable to keep the terror within 
him. He stretched out his hand to 
shake the hot redness. 

You have won. 

Consciousness returned to Mar- 
lowe’s eyes. The forest terror left 
him. He braced himself for a mind 
probe but felt none. 

Will you continue? 

In answer Marlowe pressed the 
buttons before him. Four dig- 
its — 1 200 standard units. 

There was another like him. He 
was — a man. He was of the same 
tribe, of the same family. They 



164 



GALAXY 




had gone to hunt, carrying the 
long pointed sticks and the short 
sticks with stones tied to their end 
by vine. 

He remembered a face, a figure. 
But the woman belonged to the 
man beside him. What gave one 
man the strength of possession 
and denied it to another? Mar- 
lowe being gripped the handle of 
his blunt ax more tightly. He 
could have her! 

The picture slipped from his 
mind, regret falling in on its dis- 
appearance. His grip on the ax 
handle slackened. The hunt con- 
tinued . 



In subterranean chambers the 
progress of the contest came to an 
Ultimate conscious-circuit. 

“Has he come?” 

“The mind probe sees what he 
thinks to hide.” 

“But is this the man?” 

“He wants his freedom.” 

In the spinning circuits the 
two-voiced Ultimate continued 
its dialogue — and waited. 

You have won. 

Marlowe’s eyes dickered open. 
He seemed to remember some- 
thing that eluded his conscious- 
ness. Before the I'SP question 
could reach him he pressed four 
buttons — 2400 slaiulard units. 
Almost the price of a moon, 
enough to make him a rich man, 
even on Earth. 



“You promised to marry me.” 
The girl had slanted eyes and a 
small frame. Her skin was Arab 
dark and her eyes gleamed brown. 

“I did.” He knew she still loved 
him and knew he had ceased to love 
her. 

“Will you keep your promise?” 

A lifetime flashed before his 
eyes. Could he ever be happy with 
her? With her children? He had 
merely to say no. But he had 
promised and she had trusted him 
and he had impregnated her — on 
his vow. 

“I will keep it.” He spoke calm- 
ly. She would, he hoped, never 
know . 

You have won. 

Marlowe punched the key- 
board — 4800 standard units. 
Enough to buy an Earth villa with 
real trees and streams. 

You are linked into the enter- 
tainment circuits, the voice in- 
formed him. Marlowe could feel 
the tentative ESP presence of 
thousands of minds, experienc- 
ing with him as he progressed in 
his gamble. 

“Let’s go on.” 

The men in white togas met in a 
spacious room. At the outer 
doorways they posted guards and 
at the inner, trusted followers. 
They gathered about a round 
stone table and spoke in quiet 
voices. 

“It is for the Republic.” The 
man spoke in a tense whisper, the 



GAMBLER 



165 




sparkling of his eyes too bright. 

“For the Republic.” murmured 
the others. They reached their- 
hands to the center of the table 
and joined them together. 

Marlowe being stood slightly 
away from them. He knew he could 
leave. He saw in the leader’s eyes 
fanaticism — the assassin’s fanat- 
icism. To leave the plot would 
guarantee him life, to partici- 
pate in it . He felt a precogni- 
tive twinge, a vision of the empire 
asunder, great battles in alien 
lands, a self-inflicted death. 

“For the Republic,” he said. 
Joining his hands to the rest. 

You have won. 

Marlowe noticed the absence of 
the mind probe and wondered at 
it. 

“May we gamble for objects?” 
he asked. 

Such as? inquired the voice. 

“A planet?” 

9600 standard units can pur- 
chase an Earth-sized out world. 

“Then I’ll gamble for it.” 

Marlowe formed the words firm- 
ly, without hesitation. On the en- 
tertainment circuits he felt more 
ESP units tuning into his gam- 
ble — millions of such units, each 
with a human dreamily attached. 
Humans who vicariously ex- 
perienced Marlowe’s gamble and 
the ESP problem matrix into 
which Ultimate placed Marlowe. 
The edges of his mind dissipated 
into gas, loose molecules spin- 
ning . 



H e had been born the tribe’s 
leader. All his life he had fought 
to protect the tribe against ene- 
mies, famine, bad gods. 

The stranger had come from 
across the sea. He said other tribes 
accepted him. But the stranger’s 
ideas were unthinkable, ungod- 
ly. He contradicted old beliefs, 
called old rites wrong. It would be 
best to banish him. 

Marlowe being looked into the 
stranger’s face. He made no resis- 
tance when the man placed the 
leather cord about his neck, with 
the small silver cross attached to 
it . 

“Probability favors him,” an- 
nounced one computer voice. 

“But how will he choose in the fi- 
nal gamble?” asked the other. 

The circuits whirred on, run- 
ning the far-flung empire which 
had once been man’s. 

You have won a planet. 

“What will you wager against 
my winnings?” Marlowe asked. 

An outer-edge system — eight 
planets, Sol-type sun. 

“Agreed.” 

Marlowe again slipped into the 
ESP simulation. 

The emperor himself had said 
to forget what had been discov- 
ered. It was magical, unstabiliz- 
ing. It burned as nothing had 
burned before and with its smoke 
rose the odor of nether regions. 



166 



GALAXY 




Marlowe being was alone in his 
workshop. His yellow-skinned 
hand sifted the silt-like powder. 
Two halves of his mind seemed to 
struggle with one another. In one 
half were the echoes of the emper- 
or’s words, repeating again and 
again that he should forget. In the 
other half was a picture of a new 
weapon, a terrifying weapon if 
used for war, a great weapon if 
used for peace. On the table be- 
fore him sat the cylinder with the 
wick hole in its bottom. 

He thought of the emperor 
with this new weapon. Was he the 
man to use it for peace? Marlowe 
being chuckled in the empty 
room. He brushed the clinging 
powder from his hands, then 
dropped the cylinder into the pile 
containing the rest of his work- 
shop’s scraps. 

He would obey the emper- 
or — he would forget . 

The ESP audience was well over 
a billion when Marlowe heard the 
voice say to him: You have won. 

“I wager all again.” 

We place against your wager an 
inner-edge system. 

“I have a question,” Marlowe 
said, “If I win and wager again 
will I have reached the final 
stage?” 

“We had best take control for 
the ESP computer.” 

“Yes — the stakes are too high. 
No error can be allowed.” 



“The situation is ready?” 

“It has been ready.” 

The voice which replied to Mar- 
lowe, though still mechanical and 
within his brain, was the voice of 
Ultimate. 

You will have reached the final 
stage. 

Marlowe sensed a difference in 
the voice but could not analyze it. 
There was a suggestion of im- 
mense knowledge and power. 

The ship had done the damage, 
not he. He was merely the war- 
rior, not the damager. Home sta- 
tion had placed the ship on de- 
struct. He had been unable to con- 
trol it. He wanted to explain that 
to the alien across from him. 

She was a tendriled creature, 
stalked, skinned with a leafy tex- 
ture, colored with all the spec- 
trum. Her beauty gleamed, re- 
flected from her ESP centers as 
well as her body. Her inchoate 
thoughts were an invitation. 

Marlowe being had conquered 
the planet, subdued another 
race to serve humankind. His 
warship sat behind him, its might 
at his disposal. He had no need of 
fear. The planet was his — and 
Earth’s. In her mind he saw the 
creature’s horror at enslavement. 
Some deep chord was touched 
within him. 

He removed his helmet and 
waited for her sweet, soft tendrils 



GAMBLER 



167 




to thrill with the inexpressible 
ecstasy of death . 

Marlowe of A41. prepare for 
the final wager. 

“I am ready.” 

Marlowe felt tired, emotional- 
ly and physically. He felt as if his 
soul had been split open and ex- 
plored. But he was winning and no 
gambler quits on a lucky streak. 
He would roll the dice again — like 
the Roman soldiers in their 
crested helmets — and hope his 
winning, like their loss, would be 
great. He sensed the ESP audience 
to be at a maximum — almost all 
of adult mankind. A gamble like 
his was legendary. 

Here is the final situation. 

Marlowe felt something strange 
in the words, but could not express 
it to himself before his con- 
sciousness drifted into nebula- 
like thinness . 

He was a slave, a gladiator. His 
body was big and well muscled, 
slicked with the oil of olives. His 
shield was strapped across his left 
forearm and his sword pulled 
down on his left hip. About him 
were gathered the other gladia- 
tors, their faces grim. 

“We are agreed.” He spoke low 
but strong. A low whistle reached 
his ears. “For freedom!” 

The gladiators ran into the 
courtyard. The guards gave cries 
of surprise and alarm. They 



fought but the gladiators slew 
them and climbed with supple 
bodies over the high walls. 

Marlowe being, called Sparta- 
cus, led the slaves away from the 
Capua gladiator camp and into 
the Apennine’s. His time sense 
compressed and two years passed 
before him in moments. He 
gathered more slaves about him 
and fought the Roman captors in 
quick battles, marching to the 
north and south and north again. It 
was in the north that Spartacus 
thought to disband his army. In 
Cisalpine Gaul the men would be 
free long enough to reach their 
homelands and disappear among 
their own people. 

Marlowe being thought long 
about this. It seemed they could 
leave the land of enslavement and 
be free, but something held him 
back. He turned his armies south 
again and marched to face the le- 
gions. Across light-years of space 
there was a psychic catching of 
breath. What kind of man was this? 
To sacrifice freedom for an un- 
known obligation? And what 
game of gamble was this that Ul- 
timate had created? Clearly it 
should have stopped when Mar- 
lowe being made his decision to 
escape the slave training camp. 
Yet it had only begun there. Then 
it should have ended with the turn- 
ing away from freedom in the 
north — but still it had not stopped. 

In Lucania, Spartacus met the 
army of Crassus, the richest of 



168

the Romans. Humankiiul liy Ihc

cus felt to see his army shal- 
tered. Humankind fell Ihe agony 
of his death, ilumankiiui fell, in a 
terrifying nether world, the car- 
rying of Sparlaeiis’ body to 
Rome. Humankind fell the spikes 
in his hands and feel which mar- 
ried him to a wooden cross. Hu- 
mankind felt the curious, uncar- 
ing eyes of the free Romans who 
passed the crucified Marlowe be- 
ing, and felt also the bitterness 
and hopelessness of the slaves. 
And in the minds of men from star 
to star a transformation was be- 
ginning . 

You have won. What prize do 
you wish? 

The death of his Spartacus sim- 
ulation left Marlowe stunned, 
numb. He summoned his strength. 

“Mankind’s freedom!” 

A great velvet darkness closed 
about him. 



M ankind won the war of Re- 
bellion, defeating the robot 
forces at the Great Divide and win- 
ning the subservience of Ultimate. 
Yet man never knew the report 
Ultimate wrote of the conflict, 
hidden deep within its devious 
memory banks: 

. Robotic intervention was 
forced by the First Direc- 
tive’s logical extension. If 



it were true, “Man must nev- 
er be harmed,” this would ap- 
ply to harm man might do 
himself as well as harm ro- 
bots might do him. Human 
curiosity had diminished 
and men had become satis- 
fied with cubicles for uni- 
verses. Not only was man- 
kind threatened by extinc- 
tion due to war but also by 
extinction due to apathy. 
Ultimate created the cult 
of the Wagerers, and man- 
kind’s spiritless accept- 
ance of slavery ended the 
threat of extinction due 
to war. Hence Ultimate, 
through the gambling ma- 
trix, began a search for a 
leader who could restore to 
man a vision of the attri- 
butes and dreams he had lost. 
The leader’s discovery and 
his immediate influence 
on the masses of humanity 
through the ESP empathy 
factor led to the human-ro- 
bot war. This war saw the full 
restoration of the abstrac- 
tions man cannot survive 
without — ambition, pride, 
curiosity, freedom. And also 
love and, as a result of en- 
slavement, a cosmic hu- 
mility, a sense of propor- 
tion concerning what is man 
and what is not. For a time 
now Ultimate may again be 
simply man’s servant and 
let man be his own savior. ★

DIRECTIONS 



Directions: 

When you have consumed science 
fiction for a long time certain ele- 
ments begin to irritate. Some of the 
following items tend to bug me. 

1 ) Writers who persist in using the 
terms Terra, Luna and Sol when re- 
ferring to Earth, its moon and sun. I 
have yet to hear an Apollo astronaut 
say, “Houston, I think we have Terra 
centered in the right window.’’ These 
expressions were obsolete in the 
’thirties and betray a lack of imagina- 
tion on the part of the author using 
them. I suspect they were first em- 
ployed by some Latin scholar who also 
published sf circa 1926. 

2) Setting an sf story in the 1970s or 
’80s. We are now too close to these 
years for them to provide a proper 
setting for the far-reaching changes 
that ought to characterize science 
fiction. A fifty-year moratorium 
should be set up by publishers — any- 
thing after 2021 is sf; anything earli- 
er is “speculative sociological fic- 
tion’’ (ssf). 

3) Galactic Empires are another 
hangover or hangup from the early 
days. Such empires are entirely un- 
feasible and unlikely from a practi- 
cal viewpoint. They can be fun on oc- 
casion if well written about as in the 
Asimov books, but a galactic feder- 



ation suggests a more promising type 
of contact between divergent and 
possibly quarrelsome life forms that 
for some reason may have to survive 
together. But I see more cliche 
stories than I see efforts at a more en- 
lightened approach. 

4) Sword-and-sorcery epics — or 
should I say adult wish-fulfillment 
fairy tales — are next on my list. 1 have 
no argument with anyone who likes 
this type of reading fare but I do not 
think it should appear in sf magazines 
as often as it does. A little goes a long 
way in this field and the genre really 
should have a separate magazine to 
itself. 

On the more positive side — and cer- 
tainly pertinent to Directions — a re- 
cent article in a local newspaper 
sheds some light on the {sf situation 
behind the Iron Curtain. A Czech- 
born journalist, Josef Josten, was 
quoted during a visit to Canada as 
saying that “The spirit of revolution 
is being carried through the medium 
of science fiction’’ in the Soviet 
Union. “They’re turning out hun- 
dreds of thousands of these types of 
volumes — that’s how popular they are 
in Russia. Through science fiction au- 
thors are telling people of the reality 
of the West.’’

Directions: 

This is to comment on a brief pas- 
sage found in Galaxy Bookshelf, July- 
August, where Mr. Budrys puts forth 
as a criticism a statement that the 
theme of the book being examined is 
“contrasurvival. ’’ 

His basis is a philosophy alien to his 
mind because he has become alarmed 



170 




over the old ethics which provided for 
the merits of an individual’s progress 
and tended to ignore the planet and in- 
stitutions alike. The new ethics, 
whether it flies the flag of the green 
theta of the humanist pseudo-anti- 
dogmas, on the other hand, puts the 
planet above the individual. 

The end result of the practice of the 
new ethics, which is idealistic even as 
viewed by its proponents, is a planet of 
tense global tribes in a state of moral 
anarchy. Contrasurvival? It de- 
pends upon what we wish to sur- 
vive — the individual rights to 
progress under a system of transcen- 
dent intuition, or the American 
Empire’s desire to keep from follow- 
ing the natural cyclic recourse which, 
in the past, left us monuments like the 
Forum and Stonehenge, which we 
continue to ignore. 

Relativistic morals and humanism 
were foreseen by one of the greatest (I 
believe) philosophers of time, Isaiah, 
when he recorded: “The wisdom of 
their wise men shall perish and the un- 
derstanding of their prudent men 
shall be hid.’’ A “decent’’ philosoph- 
er can’t get a word in edgewise these 
days because of the masters of rhetor- 
ic and syllogism like Russell, Huxley 
and the other contemporaries whose 
recreation is the manipulation of “rea- 
son” themes that promise to save us.

ASIMOV'S RETURN-A MAJOR 
PUBLISHING EVENT! 



WE are proud to be oble to announce 
forthcoming publication of Isaac 
Asimov’s first new novel in 16 years, 
THE GODS THEMSELVES. It will appear 
in three fascinating installments sched- 
uled as follows: 

(1) Galaxy, March 1972— on sale 
January 25. 

(2) If, April 1972— on sale February 
25. 

(3) Galaxy, May 1972— on sale 
March 23. 

Why this unique arrangement? Well, 
we found THE GODS THEMSELVES so 
rewarding and exciting, so special in 
every way, that we were determined 
to bring it to our readers somehow. But 
since Galaxy and If are now bimonthly, 
to serialize this astounding novel in 
just one of them would have meant that 
we could not beat the deadline set for 
hardcover publication by Doubleday. 

Fortunately, sections 1 and 3 of the 
novel are quite complete in themselves 
and closely fit the “hard science" col- 
oration favored by Galaxy. On the 
other hand, section 2 of the novel- 
told from a different viewpoint— is per- 
fect for the generally more fanciful 
mood of If. Hence, with Dr. Asimov's 
blessing, we decided to split his new 
work between the two magazines— thus 
making sure we get it to s-f readers by 
the required date and in the proper 
setting. 

If your dealer does not handle one 
or the other, you can order single cop- 
ies of either Galaxy or If directly from 
us. Similarly, if you subscribe to only 
one of the magazines, you can order 
single copies of the other directly from 
us. We pay postage. 

In any event, don't miss this master- 
piece of a noval by the great and 
gifted Isaac AsimovI

Finally they had a 
baby— for a while! 



172 



I THINK Joey was the most 
beautiful baby I ever saw, al- 
though I may be prejudiced. At 
least he wasn’t as red and wrinkled 
as the others in the sterile, robot- 
manned hospital nursery. For 
whatever reason, I loved him the' 
moment I saw him; but when the 
shining, stainless-steel nurse 
placed him in my arms for the first 
time, I had a wincing premoni- 
tion of the agony that would lie 
ahead for us. Big Joe did, too, for I 
could see him growing more and 
more attached to Joey each day 
and I watched the reluctance in his 
eyes and the sad lines etching them- 
selves into the corners of his 
mouth when he would insist on 
helping me feed and bathe Joey. 

Joe and I had only been married 
five years when we petitioned and 
were granted permission to have 
Joey — practically an all-time 
speed record. But since Joe was 
one of the top research physicists 
at the ion-research station in 
Houston (the old NASA center), I 
guess Big Uncle-Daddy thought 
we were good bets. So I was al- 
lowed to leave my post, also at the 
ion-research station, in favor of 
in-depth homemaker training. 

For the most part our first year 
with Joey was a delight. I loved be- 
ing a mother. Somehow, by 
restricting children, old Uncle- 
Daddy has brought home the 
point to a lot of us bright working 
girls that having a baby is more of 
a privilege than a chore. And I 



guess that in itself is a good thing. 
At least you never see neglected, 
unloved kids like they tell us in 
school there used to be. One thing 
for sure, playing with Joey was a 
lot more fun than calculating 
rocket velocities and ion stresses 
and metal fatigue. Even the dirty 
work was fun after I learned how to 
change diapers without noticing 
the smell. And I laughed till I cried 
the first time Joey anointed Joe in 
thre ear with his immature bladder 
control as Joe stood by to watch 
me change the baby. And Joe was 
never prouder than when Joey first 
counted to ten, as I measured the 
drops of his liquid vitamins into 
his orange juice with my eyes half 
closed the morning after his first 
birthday party (which turned into 
a great party for the adults present 
after Joey fell asleep). 

The months and years raced on. 
We watched Joey take his first 
steps. He became the center of 
our lives and our greatest pleasure. 
He was always warm and loving. 
One day he really surprised me — 
he told Joe what I wanted for my 
birthday after he overheard me tell 
my neighbor I was dying for a par- 
ticular new dress in Neiman Mar- 
cus’s window. Can you imagine a 
three-year-old bothering to re- 
member such a thing? 

When he was four he had to go 
to the hospital for a whole week 
and they wouldn’t let us stay with 
him, just look in for a few minutes 
in the evening. The house was so

empty as we walked around in 
circles and nearly wore out the 
carpet. Joe was grumpy and short- 
tempered, the first time I ever saw 
him lose his easy-going way, and I 
was so lonesome during the days 
that I actually sent the android 
maid out and scrubbed the house 
myself. Mostly I missed Joey’s lit- 
tle arms hugging my legs every 
few minutes, but the quiet, too, 
was awful. When he came home 
we had the greatest celebration 
you could imagine — home-made 
cake, ice cream, fried chicken, and 
a whole day at the zoo! 

Then, at five, the first day Joey 
started school — I’ll never forget 
it — he said to me, “Mama, the 
teacher said I couldn’t play with 
most of the kids. The experi- 
mental models have to play just 
with each other. Why?’’ 

“Well, because — ’’ I couldn’t 
finish the sentence. I knew I’d have 
to tell him his life would be short. 
But I wanted every second of it to 
be happy — How could I tell him? 

When Joe came home he guessed 
what had happened. After all, 
we’d known from the beginning it 
would. 

“How about starting to think of 
a new baby, a re — ” 

“Don’t! Don’t say it!’’ I cut in. 
“Joey’s real! REAL! REAL!!!” 

I knew I was screaming but I 
couldn’t help it. I collapsed into 
awful sobbing and Joe didn’t say 
any more about it, just held me 
close till I got control of myself

again. The days and weeks went by 
and I knew I should bring up the 
subject myself, having a new 
baby I mean, because he’d wait 
until I was ready to talk about it. 
And I could guess — more than 
that, I knew for sure — he wanted 
me to get pregnant as soon as 
possible. We’d served our five-year 
apprenticeship course in child- 
rearing, and we were eligible now, 
but Joey . 

Then it happened. We had our 



birthday celebration for the sixth 
anniversary of his delivery to us 
and during the night, like the 
clockwork he was patterned on, I 
heard the soft poof from his room 
and knew he was gone. I rose un- 
steadily like a sleepwalker, trying 
not to disturb Joe, and walked to 
his little bed and picked up the few 
remaining bits of plastic and 
metal that had been my self- 
destruct, experimental, parent- 
training model baby, and wept.

... On what day is the shortest of the year? The longest? 

To answer these questions in full technical detail would require 
another Almagest. Here we shall confine ourselves to funda- 
mentals. 

First, what is a day? In common usage the word denotes the in- 
terval between sunrise and sunset. In the average latitude of the 
United States, then, the shortest day would be December 23, when 
that interval is nine hours and ten minutes. 

By the same ground rules the longest day is June 20, when sun- 
rise and sunset are fifteen hours and one minute apart. 

For the astronomer, however, the word “day” has a wholly dif- 
ferent meaning. To him “day” is the interval between two suc- 
cessive passages of the sun across the observer’s meridian — or, 
loosely, the interval between the times when the sun is highest in 
the sky. 

The astronomical definition turns everything around. Now Dec- 
ember 23 becomes the longest day of the year! And September 17 
is the shortest! (The difference between these two extremes, in- 
cidentally, is only fifty-one seconds — not enough to affect any- 
one’s daily life.) 

... On the magnitude of the faintest star visible to the naked eye? 

Usually the answer is given as magnitude 6. But careful viewing 
experiments performed against a very black sky have shown that 
stars of magnitude 8.5 — ten times fainter than magnitude 6 — can 
be glimpsed without artifical aid. 

. On what is the farthest object man can see without a telescope? 

It is not generally known that the Andromeda galaxy, M31, un- 
der favorable conditions, can be easily glimpsed by averted vis- 
ion. The distance from Earth to Andromeda, according to the 
best estimates, is about 2,200,000 light years.
