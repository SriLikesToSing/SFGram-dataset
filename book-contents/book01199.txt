The aliens had left a mighty 
legacy — and men were not the 
only ones who claimed it! 



I 

I’m just saying they could be 
traitors,” William Berker told the 
new commander. 

”1 take it you haven’t any great 
love for the setties,” Kenneth 
Green said. 

“A hundred and ten years ago, 
the Perfidisians drove us out of this 
section of the Eridanus line.” 
Berker’s throat bobbed. He was 
fifty years old, thin as a rail, with a 
narrow head and jaw wrapped in 
wrinkles. Facial lines fell more 
quickly under Sun-Planet’s pull. 
The arms of his jumpsuit were 
appliqued with the insignia of the 

duty stations where he’d served. 
“They took over this station and all 
the others, and Home Field, too — 
kicked us all out — ” 

“I know that, Mr. Berker,” 
Green said. 

“And the setties worked for them 
without blinking an eye!” 

“Whether you love them or not, 
the setties are still co-workers. 



W-we can’t get along h-here with- 
out th-them. Any more of this talk 
will net you disciplining. Under- 
stood?” The new commander 
stammered when he was tired or 
angry, and now he was a little of 
both. He’d been on Sun-Planet for 
ten hours. He ran his hands through 
his hair and turned to face the 
third-in-command. Like Berker and 
ninety per cent of the civilians on 
Sun-Planet, Wedge Margul was an 
Abstainer. He was a heavy man, 
with dull eyes and pale flesh, hands 
scarred from heavy labor, forearms 
knotted with muscles. He was also 
nearly bald, with just a fringe of 
soft, white hair which he grew long 
enough to cover his ears. Compared 
to them. Green was fully aware he 
looked like a Fresher — new to 
Sun-Planet, new to the problems, 
and not nearly tough enough to 
command respect from natives like 
Berker and Margul. 

“Commander,” Margul said, 
“Mr. Berker has been under some 
strain since Loytnant Keefer died. I 
have, too. We’re upset because we 
have to pull out again. Please ex- 
cuse any indiscretion. There hasn’t 
been good military routine here for 
over a month, and we’ve lost some 
of our tact.” 

“At any rate, that’s the situa- 
tion,” Berker said. 

“I know,” Green said. They 
stood in awkward silence on the 
ramp over the settie quarters, now 
drained for monthly cleaning. Au- 
tomatic scrubbers rolled across the 



SUN-PLANET

tank bottoms, hissing and spitting 
fine mists of disinfectant. What had 
started as a tour of the locks and 
settie quarters had ended in confron- 
tation. Despite his irritation, Green 
knew the two men had handled the 
Main Station competently since 
Keefer’s death, two months past. 
And Berker’s analysis was much 
closer to the official position than 
Green found comfortable. There 
was worry among the Administers 
on Myriadne, ten thousand light 
years distant, fhat Sun-Planet held 
far more than was generally sus- 
pected. The setties had been work- 
ing on the problem for two cen- 
turies, and it looked like they might 
have the beginning of a solution any 
time. But would the solution be im- 
portant in more than just an 
abstract, philosophical sense? Might 
it not contain something, imply 
something, that would make its 
knower more powerful than anyone 
else in the explored galaxy? 

Green would have to make the 
final decision. “When the next 
group of setties arrive, I want to be 
told. I’ll be in my cabin. Thank you 
for the tour, gentlemen.’’ They 
nodded. 

Green took the elevator to the 
fifth floor of the Station and walked 
down the observation hall gallery. 
The glass was dark and reflected the 
sheer white light of the ceiling 
panels. He stopped to look at his re- 
flection. Flecks of red and green 
were visible behind the image. 

He hadn’t looked outside yet. 



Ten hours and he’d spent it all ad- 
ministratively, bickering and settling 
in and getting facts and priorities 
straight. He’d been through this hall 
four times and he hadn’t shut the 
lights out to look across the surface. 

“All right,’’ he said. “Show. 
Panels out.’’ The vox mechanisms 
dimmed the lights until the hall was 
dark and the window was transpa- 
rent. Green caught his breath. “I’m 
in charge of you now,’’ he mur- 
mured. His new command was 
one hundred thirty thousand kilo- 
meters across with an average density 
twice that of water and an average 
surface temperature of thirty degrees 
Celsius. The clouds on the horizon 
were green with a continuous dis- 
charge of heat lightning. They 
swirled and played at different 
shapes as he watched. Below them 
were the waters and islands of the 
Ganset Sea. Between the Station 
and the eastern arm of the sea was a 
rift in the black crustal shield. 
Sparks danced in the reddish glow 
which welled up from the lava of 
the mantle below. He leaned on the 
railing before the long gallery win- 
dow and squinted to pick up the 
outline of the Kerith Post, ten 
kilometers distant on Laith Island. 
The small concrete shelter housed 
the crust monitors for the area. A 
hundred thousand years before, Sun- 
Planet had been more reliable, 
under the complete control of its 
creators, the Darks. But they had 
left only a few millennia after 
finishing their work, and the world 



6 



GALAXY 




had begun its slow decay. Now 
Sun-Planet was a symbol of 
instability — Green had received 
much kidding about going to live on 
a time bomb. The symbol was 
somewhat exaggerated. The crustal 
shields were^still stable enough to 
live on, at least within the span of 
an Abstainer’s lifetime. 

The Ganset Sea was crossed by 
scattered waves of blue light, the 
phosphorescence of minute sea life. 
Ten-meter cephalopods known as 
skipperjacks fed on the small life 
and the setties fed on the skipper- 
jacks. Humans, in a way, hoped to 
feed on the setties — on their two 
centuries of studying and decipher- 
ing. 

Green hadn’t met with the setties 
yet. “Lights on,” he said. He cros- 
sed the hall and held his hand up to 
the ID plate that monitored the door 
to Officer’s Country. In his cabin, 
he lay back on the sleep field and 
closed his eyes. For a few minutes 
he contemplated whether or not to 
control his sleep. His eyes focused 
behind closed lids on the tiny speck 
of Kerith Post. That was the center 
of his decision now, the center of 
his purpose. His eyes opened. Be- 
hind closed lids it was terrible and 
lonely, as if, under the roof of his 
head, there was no one to keep him 
company ... or a crowd, none of 
whom recognized each other. 

But he did not induce sleep. He 
had six hours, and he was damned 
if he was going to let unease rob 
him of the treasure of uncontrolled 



slumber. In an hour he was quiet 
and breathing evenly. 

II 

Sun-Planet’s morning, which 
came every three terrestrial days, 
was a weak show. The distant flare 
which was Koestler, four billion 
kilometers away, threw its murky 
spotlight over the horizon clouds, 
then rose to cast a dull, refractory 
gleam on the crustal plains. The 
Station crew carried a continuous 
watch, and it was only coincidental 
that morning coincided with the 
watch change and Green’s appear- 
ance in the lounge. He carried his 
Man Amplification Suit in one hand 
and a cup of coffee in the other. 
His walk was measured; he’d only 
been awake for fifteen minutes and 
was still groggy. 

Berker and Margul awaited him 
in the officer’s lounge. He was 
mildly irritated to see the two civi- 
lians there — but they’d earned the 
privilege. Sun-Planet’s government 
was an unusual arrangement, a 
compromise between the Combine 
Astry and the original controllers; 
the Galactic Social Engineers Berker 
and Margul had as much right to 
command privileges as he. 

“Come in, Commander,” Margul 
said, fleshy hand beckoning. The 
smile was almost too much for 
Green’s morning condition, but he 
managed a weak grin in return and 
set his MAS beside the chair Mar- 
gul indicated. 



SUN-PLANET

“We hope you’re ready for Water 
today.’’ 

“Hm?” The reference passed 
him by for a moment. “Oh. Most 
interested.’’ He took a sip of the 
coffee. It was the ritual of the 
morning drink that helped, not the 
minimal stimulant in the dark, thick 
brew. “Mrs. Hass and Mr. Pink in- 
form me we have setties in the lock 
now. I’d like you gentlemen to ac- 
company me and give introduc- 
tions.’’ 

“This group is here for ritual 
reasons, Commander,’’ Berker said. 
“You might want to wait for an in- 
formation party — ’’ 

“I’d like to see a few setties be- 
fore visiting Water,’’ Green coun- 
tered. “They d-don’t have to be 
talkative.’’ 

Berker nodded and they stood, 
picking up their suits and carrying 
them to the central elevator. The 
Station was an oval building of five 
stories. The top floor contained Of- 
ficer’s Country and the communica- 
tions center, the fourth floor com- 
puters, the third floor the library, 
and the second floor the crew and 
temporary civvie quarters. The first 
level, below ground, contained the 
locks and a bank of settie quarters, 
refilling with water from the canal 
after cleaning. 

The ramps above the settie quar- 
ters were cluttered with sprayer 
tanks and long-handled hoses left by 
the sanitation detail. Margul 
threaded his way through the tangle 
and glanced back apologetically at 



Green. “A lapse — ’’ he began. 

“Put the detail on minor report 
and get them up here as soon as the 
setties are gone. Tell them their pay 
is suspended for the watch during 
which they left this equipment out. 
I want settie quarters clear of all 
human equipment, whether the set- 
ties can see it or not. That’s a fixed 
rule, Mr. Margul, Mr. Berker.’’ 

Berker nodded absently. The set- 
ties, though equipped with massive 
hand-like flippers, had had a long- 
standing law against the use of 
tools. They reluctantly accepted 
structures like the locks and quarters 
in the Station, and necessary human 
aids, but for some reason hidden in 
their cetacean ancestry they abhor- 
red technology. 

Each lock was a hundred meters 
long. There were five locks in the 
northern pens, and ten in the south- 
ern. The water was dark and 
radiated a steamy warmth which 
Green found uncomfortable. Three 
of the locks were occupied. 

“Who’s with us today?’’ Berker 
asked the guard. 

“Lock one has Two-Dot, three 
has V-Spot, and five has Zero- 
Nose.’’ 

“Let’s go to five first,’’ Margul 
said. “Zero-Nose is the group 
negotiator this month. This isn’t an 
information party, but I’m sure he’d 
appreciate our speaking to him in- 
stead of V-spot, his interlocutor. 
It’s a sign of confidence.’’ Green 
agreed with a smile. That he could 
sympathize with.

GALAXY 




The ramps above the locks were 
illuminated by steplights that had 
been carefully placed so that their 
backwash didn’t reach the water. It 
was like travelling down a dark 
tunnel, with*the sound of sloshing 
water all around, and a few meters 
away, the whoosh of Two-Dot 
breeching in lock one. 

Green instinctively took a deep 
breath as he peered over the ramp 
into the black waters of the lock. 
He could barely see the glistening 
shape of the settie’s fin and hear the 
rippling sound of the water as the 
creature breathed. The click of his 
air hole was less pronounced than 
Green had been led to believe. 

Berker tapped his knuckles on the 
railing. “Zero-Nose,” he said into 
the translator mike. “We accept 
your presence and position, and re- 
quest communication.” 

The water became agitated as the 
settie began a slow roll to his side. 
Green grew accustomed to the dark 
slowly, and thought he saw the tiny 
gleam of an eye. His mind felt a 
pressure like the preliminary signs 
of a headache. The supersonic vo- 
calization was picked up by the 
translator and converted. 

“Presence acknowledged,” the 
settie said. 

“Zero-Nose, we have a new Sta- 
tion Commander. His name is Ken- 
neth Green, and he would like to 
speak to you.” 

“Not today,” the settie said. 

“Then at your convenience,” Ber- 
ker said with a wry twist of face. 



“We wish you luck with your 
duties, and thank you for your at- 
tention.” He switched off the mike. 

“They’re here to fulfill part of a 
swearing-in ceremony in Water, 
near as we can tell,” Margul said. 
“The locks are something of an 
ordeal for young setties. In the nur- 
series, they are taught to despise all 
machines and tools. Then they have 
to face the real world and deal with 
tuberiders and MAS’s and all the 
things we need to survive. It’s 
pretty traumatic. I don’t think they 
can really respect humans. We’re 
too dependent on our machines.” 

“It can be a damned stifling at- 
titude,” Berker commented. 

Green was a little puzzled. “How 
do you keep track of their findings 
without recorders? I thought it was 
passed on by verbal communica- 
tions.” 

“Yes, but usually the tenders 
mediate. They’re trained to under- 
stand settie languages in the middle, 
human frequencies. Sometimes they 
swim with the setties and work in 
the nurseries.” Margul smiled. 
“Mr. Berker was married to one. 
They make interesting mates. Those 
of us not trained to have long 
memories have to resort to recorders. 
We don’t qualify for more than 
amenities, I’m afraid.” 

“I haven’t met a tender yet, 
either,” Green said with some 
chagrin. “Gentlemen, pardon my 
ignorance and clumsiness these first 
few days. There are a lot of things 
not covered in the manuals. Your 



SUN-PLANET 



9 




guidance is deeply appreciated.” 

Margul smiled noncommittaly, 
and Berker nodded without apparent 
sympathy. Green was ill at ease 
again, and wondered if his admis- 
sion had been called for. He’d 
heard that Keefer’s command had 
been less formal than usual, to lub- 
ricate interaction between the Astry 
personnel and the civilians. Green’s 
normal instinct was to follow a 
rather old set of cardinal rules for 
leadership, among them never ad- 
mitting ignorance or weakness to 
one you command. If informality 
didn’t work, would a hard-nose at- 
titude do the trick? Personally, he 
disliked the prospect — but profes- 
sionally speaking, it was a strong 
possibility. 

The launch which carried them 
down the canal was padded with 
fluid-filled plastic bags. They lay 
back on them, breathing heavily in 
the rigorous gravitation. The water 
churned black and oily, leaving an 
unfoamed, unbubbled turbulence 
behind the launch. Berker 
supplemented the automatic guid- 
ance system. In a few minutes 
they were on the open Ganset Sea. 
The wave-vibrations grew heavier 
and the boat trembled. At this grav- 
ity each ripple was a heavy blow, 
the equivalent of a much larger 
wave on seas less tightly bound. 
Green forcibly stilled a tinge of 
nausea and asked questions to keep 
his mind occupied. 

He’d studied the crustal oxygena- 
tion cycle for several hours in the 



library of the ship which had deliv- 
ered him to Sun-Planet, but his 
understanding was still incomplete. 
Berker explained the chemical 
mechanism which allowed the crust 
to release oxygen when heated by 
the mantle, and the reverse process 
by which the air was adsorbed in 
the venting cracks between the 
crustal shields, to be recycled and 
purified in the chemical furnace of 
the mantle. The mantle beneath the 
shields rested, in turn, on the 
super-hot gases of the boundary 
layer. Beneath the boundary layer 
was the fusing-hot core of the 
world. It was all delicately 
stabilized by the pressure of gases 
and radiation rising, crust and man- 
tle suppressing, and other checks 
and balances incompletely under- 
stood. 

“Kerith Post keeps the crust 
under scrutiny,” Berker said. 
“Haven’t had a good-sized eruption 
for ten years, but the Secondary 
Northeast Shield has decayed re- 
cently, and that might cause trou- 
ble. Real problems come when the 
bounded seas wear through and 
water gets under the shields. That’s 
what caused the polar explosion 
twenty-five years ago. Dust and ash 
covered most of the southern 
hemisphere for three years. We 
damned near had a vent of the 
boundary layer there, and I think 
that would have meant the end of 
Sun-Planet. Loytnant Keefer then 
had a sea-wall erected which would 
bind in the oceans more strongly 



10 



GALAXY 




— that was twenty years back. It 
wasn’t needed; the mantle crystal- 
lized along the rim of the shield and 
picked up something from the air. 
Turned right into crust, five times 
higher than our wall. Funniest thing 
you ever saw.” 

“Sun-Planet is more stable than 
we give her credit for,” Margul 
said. “She was here a hundred 
thousand years before us, probably 
will last long after we’re gone.” 

The launch turned north and a 
cooler wind from the west swirled 
around them, carrying the dusty 
smell of the crust and the rich, 
sweaty odor of the hot beaches 
below Kerith Post. “The Darks 
built well,” Berker agreed. “But 
they were too humble for their own 
good.” What Sun- Planet’s creators 
had looked like, or where they had 
come from, was still a mystery. 
They had left no clue to their own 
nature, nor to why they had built 
the world in the first place. The set- 
ties called them “Ones-Without- 
Taste,” which translated, with em- 
phasis on the most important human 
sense, as “the Darks.” The Perfidi- 
sians were similar in hiding their 
nature to outsiders, but they were 
not related to the Darks — that 
theory had been laid to rest a cen- 
tury before. 

“Water, five kilometers ahead,” 
Berker said. The Darks had left few 
overt structures on Sun-Planet. The 
most important to settie researchers 
was called Water. The setties wor- 
shipped it as well as living in it. As 



the launch approached Green could 
see why. 

Water was a mountain of semi- 
transparent tubes and bubbles and 
endless labyrinthine capillaries 
formed from the crustal substance. 
It looked like a scuff of foam raked 
from a tub of detergent, then shaped 
into rough, rounded geometric 
forms, and placed in the middle of 
the Ganset Sea. It seemed volcanic 
but there were no good theories as 
to how it had been shaped. Sea- 
water, sucked up by capillary and 
chemical actions still being studied, 
filled it from top to bottom, with 
occasional air bubbles and low- 
pressure pockets. Most of the tubes 
were wide enough to admit the 
largest setties. 

From a distance, it resembled a 
child’ s sculpture made of dirty 
snow. But as the launch fell beneath 
its shadow, the dirt-color resolved 
into subtle browns and sea-greens. 
A human habitation had been con- 
structed on the southern side, where 
a dozen tenders lived and worked 
with the setties. A dock extended 
from the building, with a bubble- 
like plastic canopy braced above the 
launch slip. The vessel hitched itself 
to the dock. Struggling a bit with 
his MAS, Green followed Berker 
and Margul into the building’s 
rounded doorway. 

A black-haired boy, about fifteen 
years old, with wide green eyes and 
clean, sharp features was reading a 
tapas pad as they entered. He 
switched the device off and got up 



SUN-PLANET 



11 




from his seat. The room was 
counter-gravitated, as were most 
human quarters, and much more 
comfortable than the outside. Green 
breathed deeply and unhooked the 
braces on his MAS. Berker and 
Margul stripped out of theirs more 
gracefully and left them standing 
near the door. The boy smiled a 
greeting. 

‘'Herbert Fromm, this is Com- 
mander Green,” Margul said. 

‘'Good to have you with us,” 
Fromm said. “You’re here for a 
tour of Water?” 

Green nodded and looked 
around. The room was spare and 
tacky-looking. Its plastiform walls 
had not been resurfaced in some 
time. The cracks and chips gave it 
an abandoned look. “I’m serving 
my apprenticeship to these helpful 
gentlemen until I g-get my steady 
legs.” 

“Takes a while for someone not 
bom here,” Fromm said. “I’m on 
visitor watch, not very important 
most of the time, but it seems I’ve 
hit interesting duty today. May I act 
as guide, gentlemen?” 

Berker nodded. “First, is Maday 
where we can meet and chat?” 
Bethanie Maday was the leader of 
the tenders in Water. 

“Not here. She’s at the Broken 
Level working with a party of 
young tube readers. We’ll probably 
see her on the tour. Pardon a 
second — I’ll get my MAS and be 
right with you.” 

The room echoed a little, and 
12 



made Green think of the deserted 
military towns he’d commanded 
twenty years ago as a young JG on 
Old Mao. Those quiet green halls 
and scuffed floors were almost 
exactly matched here. 

Fromm returned and led them 
down a corridor. The walls abruptly 
ended and they were inside Water, 
standing in a dark tunnel. The tun- 
nel material had been bevelled to 
make a platform. Beyond the edge, 
water quietly plashed and gurgled. 

“We’ll have a tuberider here any 
moment,” the boy told them. “You 
won’t see many setties coming in 
this way. There are too many bub- 
ble and pressure spaces this side of 
the mass. Their entrance is on the 
other side.” 

A grey shape with bright lights 
on its snout cruised up to the plat- 
form and surfaced. The tuberider 
was a metal cylinder with three 
evenly spaced wings, one of which 
served as a conning tower. Rubber 
stripping cushioned the end of each 
wing. A hissing stream of bubbles 
flowed from the rear. 

“This one is piloted by Sandra 
Neps,” Fromm said brightly. 

“Mr. Fromm’s fiancee,” Margul 
explained. 

They stepped down into the 
tuberider, hauling their suits after. 
The hatch swung shut with an ear- 
pressing plonk. 

“Take you anyplace, gentle- 
men?” Neps asked, turning in her 
conning bubble to smile at them. 
Fromm introduced Green, and Neps 

GALAXY 




held out her hand. “Pleased to meet 
you. Commander. Looks like 
you’ve had a hard day.” 

Green felt irritation that it was so 
obvious. “And it’s just beginning,” 
he said. “My preparatory fitness 
sessions didn’t last long enough, 
I’m afraid.” 

“I’ve always wondered about the 
MAS’s we use,” Neps said. “There 
has to be a better design.” 

“Nothing as flexible,” Berker 
said, squeezing past a bank of 
equipment to take a seat near the 
bubble. Fromm moved past and sat 
in the seat across from him. Green 
took a seat next to a broad, thick 
port. He was near enough to the 
front to look through the bubble and 
see where they were heading. 

“I haven’t worn one often 
enough to get used to it,” he said. 
“The main bother is hauling it 
wherever we go.” He stashed it in 
a special cabinet and strapped him- 
self into the seat, carefully follow- 
ing the instructions on a metal plate 
under the port. He adjusted the 
padding wherever it touched his 
body, and found the position sur- 
prisingly comfortable. 

“Won’t be much to see for a few 
minutes, so relax,” Neps said. 
“Here we go.” 

The tuberider moved ahead with 
a gentle whine. The ride wasn’t 
smooth, but it wasn’t rough enough 
to make Green’s stomach rebel, and 
he was thankful for small favors. 
His hands automatically gripped the 
seat arms as the tuberider angled 



up. “We won’t hit an angle greater 
than sixty, though we may roll 
one-eighty, and if you. .there. .” 
Neps reached back to point. “Mr. 
Berker, show him where the unlock 
switch is? There. Press that and the 
seat will swivel to take up most 
of the angle.” The seat swung free 
and he relaxed his grip. 

The view outside his port was 
dark, with a faint glow from the 
headlights beneath the conning bub- 
ble. The walls were evenly pocked, 
like the surface of a golf ball. He 
craned his neck to look out the 
front, and saw a section of tunnel 
brilliantly illuminated, with swal- 
lowing darkness beyond the range 
of the lights. 

“The higher we go, the thinner 
the walls become, and the more 
transparent,” she said. “Down 
here, 'they’re about thirty feet thick. 
In a few minutes we’ll be near the 
middle. Of course, it never gets 
very bright outside anyway, but the 
higher we go and the closer to the 
outside we get, the more light will 
filter through. We get eerie effects 
in here sometimes.” 

For fifteen minutes they rode 
level, bucked about in strong cur- 
rents. The wings provided effective 
but not very gentle protection when 
the tuberider struck a wall. “This is 
our steepest climb,” Neps said, and 
the tuberider pulled back until 
Green had to look down to see the 
rear of the cabin. They cruised up a 
narrow capillary for another quarter 
hour before leveling off, as the tube 



SUN-PLANET

became wider and the water lost 
some of its turbulence. 

“Oops,” Neps said softly. 
“Looks like a skipperjack ahead. 
They don’t get in here very 
often — must have snuck past last 
night during the power failure.” 

Green saw a pattern of silvery 
dots coursing ahead. 

“Do you have a prod mounted?” 
Fromm asked. 

“Not a long one. It’ll have to 
do.” 

“Here’s where you impress the 
commander with your expertise,” 
the boy said. He chuckled nervous- 

>y- 

“Expertise, hell. I do this for a 
hobby. All buckled, gentlemen? 
We’ll have to roll to prod it.” 

Tentacles coiled like tubes of 
crumpled plastic in the murkiness 
beyond the main glare of the lights. 
Seemingly random glints played 
along the fluorescent patches within 
the skipperjack’s arms and body. 
“That’s their talk,” Fromm said. 
“They do it to each other like birds 
singing. A few biologists on Home 
Field claim they see language pat- 
terns, but they haven’t come up 
with anything conclusive.” 

The eyes suddenly caught the 
tuberider lights and Green blinked 
at the reflected brilliance. They 
shone like two suns in the otherwise 
dark capillary. Then they vanished 
and he had an impression of power- 
ful tail and fins flapping. Turbu- 
lence from the animal’s backwash 
rocked the ship.

“Going away,” Neps said under 
her breath. “I’ll have to route it 
into another main tube or it’ll get 
lost and die and make the water un- 
livable. Here we go, hang tight — ” 
The tuberider twisted until they 
were hanging from their seats. The 
compensators swung them around 
slowly. Neps remained upside 
down. “Herb, my straps are biting 
— dammit — could you put some 
spare padding around my legs?” 
“Can’t get at you,” Fromm said. 
“It hurts,” the girl complained in 
a matter-of-fact tone. “I’m going to 
be black and blue.” 

“Can’t help you,” the boy said. 
“Bring us back around. You 
shouldn’t hang like that too long.” 
“Thing’s moving faster than we 
can. Okay. Can’t get it here.” The 
tuberider twisted about. “Ow. That 
hurts. Should have added the pad- 
ding before I strapped in. I ignore 
those little things.” 

Berker grunted. “Call ahead. 
Looks like it’ll take one of the two 
main forks. Don’t they lead to the 
nurseries? There should be settie 
guards up there — wouldn’t want a 
skipperjack in the nurseries.” 

Neps made a call with signal 
keyed through the translator. A 
blast of sound pounded Green’s 
ears, then reverberated up the tube. 
Echoes came back in ghost groans. 
A few seconds later, the twitter of 
distant replies reached them. The 
electronic converter boosted the sig- 
nals and the translator replied, 
“Understood. Acted upon.” 

GALAXY^ 




Green watched the last glimmer 
of the skipperjack as it disappeared 
around a bend. 

“We’re going to turn left about 
two hundred meters from here,” 
Neps said. “Then we go up another 
fifty or sixty meters and we’ll come 
out in the pools at the Broken 
Level. Sorry about the interruption, 

The tuberider followed its indi- 
cated course and Neps brought them 
up to a surging, rain-speckled sur- 
face. The vehicle broke through and 
wallowed in the wide mouth of the 
capillary, stabilizing as gyros acti- 
vated. She jockeyed it into position 
and metal clamps lifted the 
tuberider gently out of the water. 
The hatch popped and swung open, 
and Margul stepped out first. Berker 



followed, then Green, who came up 
abruptly, banging his head against 
the outstretched hand of a woman. 
He dodged and smiled apologeti- 
cally. “S-sorry,” he said. “Didn’t 
see you.” The woman helped him 
out onto the buffer platform, rub- 
bing her fingers. 

“No harm,” she said. “I haven’t 
met you before, so you must be 
Commander Green.” Fromm 
handed out the MAS’s, and the 
woman helped Green climb into his. 
She was about Green’s age, with 
tight-packed hair and a cleanly 
molded face, primly wrinkled 
around the mouth but not unattrac- 
tive. “I’m Katrina Korliss, a ten- 
der. Glad to have you with us, 
Commander.”

“F-fascinated to be here,” he 
said. The suit began to amplify 
movement and he relaxed a lit- 
tle. “Mr. Berker and Mr. Margul 
are guiding, and Ms. Neps brought 
us through a tight spot.” 

“I flubbed it a little, Kat,” the 
girl said. “Deserve to have my 
wages docked.” 

“We’ll consider it,” Korliss said. 
“Herb’s along for the ride, I take 
it. Who has visitor watch?” 
“Nobody else coming today.” 
“Anxious to join in the excite- 
ment? We won’t dock your pay too 
much, either. As you see, Com- 
mander, we don’t run a tight moun- 
tain here. Our discipline is applied 
in other directions.” 

“Katrina is one of our most ex- 
perienced tenders,” Berker said. 
“She was a fine wife to me, ten 
years ago.” 

“Mr. Berker has gone through a 
good many tenders during his 
stay,” Korliss said. Green won- 
dered what there was about the man 
that attracted anyone. Perhaps his 
thinness. He wouldn’t be such a 
burden in bed. 

Green looked around the opening 
where the tuberider was moored. 
The Broken Level was three 
kilometers above the surface of 
Sun-Planet, and the air was some- 
what rarefied, forcing him to breathe 
harder for what he needed. The 
MAS couldn’t supplement an inter- 
nal activity like respiration. 

“Gentlemen, we have a shed 
over here where you can rest. This 

16 



pull is rough on newcomers. How 
are you adjusting. Commander?” 

“Slowly,” Green answered. 

“You stutter, I understand,” 
Korliss said. “Used to stutter my- 
self.” 

Green felt his stomach muscles 
tighten. He wasn’t used to such 
familiarity, especially about his per- 
sonal problems. 

“How did you cure it?” he 
asked. 

“Setties gave me linguistic 
therapy. Turns out I had a speech 
program maladjusted, here,” she 
tapped the left side of her skull. 
“I’m more right-handed now, too. 
Used to be a complete southpaw. 
And you?” 

“Still a lefty,” he said. Therapy 
had been available on almost every 
world Green had lived on, but 
something had prevented him from 
seeking outside help. If s my prob- 
lem, he told himself. My dichotomy. 

The Broken Level was a horizon- 
tal slice taken out of Water some- 
time in the distant past, leaving 
three flat plains where the capil- 
laries popped out into open air. It 
looked like a field of craters, or the 
magnified xylem of a tree, each 
hole filled with rocking, sloshing 
water. 

Some of the holes were a 
hundred meters across, signifying 
enormous tubes passing through the 
bulk of the mountain. 

He saw two setties rolling and 
spouting in one of the pools. Their 
spray had a curiously flat, leveled- 



GALAXY 




out look, caused by the greater 
gravitation. 

“This way, Commander,” Kor- 
liss said. 

They went to the shed, a small 
plastic cubicle supplied with 
counter-gravitation, and removed 
their MAS’s. He was beginning to 
be adept with the suits, catching lit- 
tle tricks from the others on quick 
and easy unstrapping. A food unit 
stood in one corner, and Korliss of- 
fered refreshments to everyone. A 
small breakfast was served when the 
orders were in. 

When they began to eat, Korliss 
asked him if he minded discussing 
business over food. “The setties 
would consider it a heinous breach 
of ritual,” she said. “Of course, 
their eating is much more compli- 
cated than ours.” 

“I don’t mind,” Green said. 
"Time is time.” 

"Then I have a question to ask. 
How much longer until the Perfidi- 
sians start pressing us again?” 

“Ab-about a year.” 

“Is that a firm figure?” 

“Fairly. The Hafkan Bestmerit 
people who still have diplomatic 
ties with us say the Season of Re- 
gain is due about that time for 
them. It’s the closest guess anyone 
can offer.” 

Hafkan Bestmerit was the only 
mercantile consolidation made up 
entirely of non-human species. Its 
dealings with the Combine, which 
served as overseer to the consolida- 
tions, were notoriously unsteady. 



“What can we expect when they 
do come?” 

“We’ll try to evacuate before 
then,” Green replied drily. 

“And if we don’t get a chance to 
evacuate?” 

“I’m not open to unlikely specu- 
lation, Ms. Korliss. But for the sake 
of argument, we’d be physically 
safe. Sun-Planet means very little to 
them as political and territorial gain. 
If anything, it’s more inhospitable 
for them than it is for us. One of 
the few things we know about them 
is th-that their native world has a 
gravitational pull less than Earth’s.” 

“I don’t feel reassured, Com- 
mander,” Korliss said. 

“It’s not my place to be reassur- 
ing. I’m here to learn wh-what I 
c-can.” 

“Then let’s get started,” Korliss 
said. The breakfast was barely 
finished. “Herb, Sandra — put out a 
general call for two patris.” 

The two suited up and left the 
shed. A few minutes later, Green 
heard muffled booming sounds 
through the walls. Korliss suggested 
they go to the pools. Green put his 
fork down with a frown as he gazed 
at the scraps of synthecam still on 
his plate. He felt more like a politi- 
cian than an Astry officer. He put 
on his MAS, finishing last, and 
joined the others by the largest pool 
in Broken Level. Neps and Fromm 
walked back and forth on the oppo- 
site side, talking in whispers. The 
misting rain carried an electrical 
smell with it. Green glanced up to 



SUN-PLANET

see a brief reddish flash overhead. 
Sun-Planet’s atmosphere was com- 
paratively shallow, and at altitudes 
as low as twenty kilometers, 
weather and auroral phenomena 
mixed in interesting ways. 

Two setties surfaced in the pool 
and lifted their heads out of the 
water to see clearly. It was Green’s 
first good look at the creatures, 
though he had seen holos. He 
was a little shaken. Their long, 
flat-topped heads and bowed mouths 
filled with glistening yellow teeth 
were nightmarishly vicious-looking. 
Their eyes were small and piggish, 
slightly glazed as though by 
cataracts. Callosities formed bumps 
along the top ridges of their snouts, 
whitish and crusty, with an indi- 
vidual pattern of bumps for each 
settie. The patterns provided the 
basis for their names. Beneath the 
lower jaw, rills of wrinkled skin re- 
sembled the deck of a wooden ship. 
They were black for the most part, 
with a strip of white along the for- 
ward edge of their dorsal fin, and 
greyish tones running in splotches 
from their underjaw to their articu- 
lated flippers. The genetic engineers 
who had designed them could have 
done better on aesthetics, Green 
thought. Had any whales on Earth 
ever been so ugly? 

“KoZ/tf,” Korliss said. “Two 
patris. You’ll notice they’re a few 
meters larger than the normal run of 
setties. Patris are like tribal elders 
in some ways — they’re leaders of 
packs. Most setties belong to at 



least two packs, and there are 
around seven or eight thousand 
packs, each with a specific duty and 
skill. The pack networks cover most 
of the waterways, and that means, 
essentially, that they cover most of 
Sun-Planet.” She produced a porta- 
ble translator and lowered the pick- 
up cable into the pool. 

“We were called,” the box his- 
sed. “Is that White-Neck?” 

“It is,’’ Korliss replied. The 
translator murmured into the pool. 
“That’s their name for me. Who 
knows how they actually see us, 
hm?” She raised her voice. “We’d 
like to arrange a conference as soon 
as possible — a briefing for the new 
commander of the Station.” 

“Who should be there?” the 
voice asked. Green couldn’t tell 
which of the setties was talking. 
The groaning and clicking sounds in 
the pool seemed to come from both. 

“Bring F-Nose and Hack-Fin 
with you to Top Level.” 

“We will meet in an hour,” the 
voice said. With a splash of spray 
and a surge from their tails, they 
vanished. 

“F-nose is the coordinator for the 
Processing Pack in Water,” Korliss 
said. “He does most of his work 
with Maday. She’s at Top Level 
now, in conference with a group of 
Readers who’ve returned from the 
North Pole. We’ll meet her later, 
but she might be too absorbed to 
spend much time with us.” 

Green nodded. “How many set- 
ties are there in Water?” 



18 



GALAXY 




“About thirty thousand,” Kor- 
liss said. “Thjs is Grand Central for 
all information gathered around 
Sun-Planet. It might be the biggest 
library in the known Galaxy. At any 
rate, it’s unique — no books, no 
tapes or files, only setties, each 
chock to the brim with facts about 
the Dark patterns.” 

“The tuberider is re-charged,” 
Neps said. They boarded the 
vehicle and sank into the darkness 
of the capillary. 

“I’m going to give you some 
random information about setties,” 
Korliss said as they rocked gently in 
their seats. “I’m sure you’ve heard 
some of it in your briefings off- 
planet, and in your talks with Mr. 
Margul and Mr. Berker. But I need 
to know that you’re aware of some 
things, for my own peace of 
mind.” 

“Go ahead,” Green said. 

“First, a question of my own — 
why were you chosen to come 
here?” 

Green was caught off-guard. He re- 
covered quickly — it was close 
enough to a direct challenge to his 
authority that trained reflexes took 
over. “Because I’m the only man 
the Combine Astry could find in its 
ranks, still alive and commissioned, 
who’d dealt with the Perfidisians on 
a first-hand basis. I know them as 
much as they can be known.” 

Korliss nodded. “The setties call 
them the Ones Who Hide. Have 
you ever seen one?” 

“Nobody has, to my knowledge. 



I’ve also worked with twenty-three 
different intelligent species during 
the years I’ve been a duty officer. 
M-my intelligence and adaptability 
are unsurpassed by anyone in my 
rank. I’m a tough and reliable ad- 
ministrator. Does that answer your 
question?” 

Berker leaned over from his seat. 
“Ms. Korliss is known as a tough 
nut. She has very few inhibitions 
about rank and confrontation. If 
she’s gauche, forgive her. She — ” 

“That’s enough, Billie. I’m sure 
the Commander understands. Sun- 
Planet is only partly controlled by 
the Astry and the Combine. The 
rest is GASENs.” The Galactic So- 
cial Engineers had faded into gen- 
eral obscurity after their overall fail- 
ures seventy-five years before. But 
they still held onto their 
successes — and Sun-Planet was one. 
They were not directly allied with 
the Combine now, though they had 
been chartered as a Combine or- 
ganization. “We have the responsi- 
bility of protecting this world, and 
the non-human citizens on it — ” 

“And human?” Green asked. 
Berker looked like his stomach 
pained him. 

“Of course,” Korliss said. “But 
I feel more responsibility toward the 
setties than I do toward humans. 
I’m just warning you where my 
emphasis lies.” 

“Many of the tenders feel this 
way,” Margul said. Berker nodded. 

“My own emphasis has to be just 
the opposite,” Green said. “I’m 



SUN-PLANET

here to protect human interests." 
That was it, he thought — the 
ideological lines were drawn. He 
knew which side he was on offi- 
cially, but there were too many fac- 
tors for an easy personal decision. 
The setties had been created, ulti- 
mately, to serve human interests. 

Korliss bit her lower lip thought- 
fully, looking at him with that air 
peculiar to women — a sizing-up 
which inevitably brought in ques- 
tions of masculinity, one- 
upsmanship and moral rectitude. 

“Let’s get to the information," 
she said. She produced a small 
paper notebook from her pants 
pocket and leafed through it. 
“First — do you understand how the 
setties were created?" 

Green said he did. “I could stand 
having some details filled in, how- 
ever." 

“They were brought here twenty 
years after the discovery of Sun- 
Planet. They were genetically tai- 
lored from tissue samples taken 
from several species of 
cetaceans — ocean-going mammals, 
whales. Most aquatic mammals, ex- 
cept for dolphins and some seal 
species, died out by the end of the 
twenty-first century — combined cul- 
tural shock and human destruction. 
But tissue samples were kept frozen 
in case anyone ever saw fit to re- 
construct or grow them from eggs 
in vitrio. The genetic engineers who 
put the samples together designed 
the setties for endurance, strength, 
intelligence and a certain bloody- 



mindedness. They’re not an easy lot 
to work with — but they’re the ones 
most likely to survive on Sun- 
Planet. And they were put here with 
a specific task in mind. Their cul- 
ture was designed and fitted 
accordingly — ’’ 

“Sounds like an overcoat,’’ 
Fromm said, smiling to show he 
couldn’t pass up the chance. 

“All things come clothed in cul- 
ture," Green said. “John Dewey 
thought so, anyway.’’ 

“Their job," Korliss said, not 
missing a beat, “is to investigate, 
gather and correlate the information 
the Darks left on Sun-Planet." 

“So far, so clear," Green said. 
Korliss pursed her lips and turned a 
page in her notebook. 

“We still don’t know why the 
Darks built Sun-Planet. Our best 
guess is they were storing informa- 
tion here. But why they chose this 
design for an information bank is 
beyond us. Structures like Water 
and the Organic Shields are vast 
coded systems which we have yet to 
break. Here." She unbuckled her- 
self and struggled with the tilt of 
the tuberider to come nearer to 
Green’s port. “Neps, some light 
starboard please." A lamp switched 
on below the port and the golf-ball 
indentations of the wall became 
clear. “These were left by some 
form of animal life, probably not 
the Darks themselves. We think the 
Darks may have done their own 
genetic engineering, and that Water 
could be the skeleton, or shell, of 



20 



GALAXY 




one such life form. If so, it must 
have been an incredible thing — or 
colony of things. These dents in the 
wall are more than just the marks of 
tube-borers, or whatever the in- 
habitants were. They have a sense 
and pattern, a precision and fre- 
quency of placement. Somewhere in 
all that, there must be millions upon 
billions of bits of data, held in the 
combined factors of depth, density 
of pocks per unit area, frequency of 
sinusoidal fluctuations . They are 
not just natural or purely random. 
There are five packs mapping and 
studying the designs in these tubes. 
We call them Readers. Setties are 
perfectly designed for such studies, 
since they can stay submerged 
without air for two hours, don’t 
need lights to guide them, and can 
read the patterns by sonar. They 
also have what amounts to eidetic 
memory. That memory extends 
not only to whatever they hear and 
taste, but to their own thoughts and 
reactions; they can remember what 
(hey thought at any given moment 
in their lives. Don’t ask me how 
they manage it — I’ve concluded the 
whole thing is humanly inconceiva- 
ble.” 

“That’s another reason I was sent 
here,” Green said. “0-£ne of my 
specialties is languages and codes.” 

“Good. You might be the first 
commander ever to show interest in 
our borer-tracks.” She turned 
another page in the notebook. 
k Okay. Next — information storage 
in the Organic Shields. About one 



out of every five crustal plates is 
made of complex chains of organic 
molecules. Some of these shields 
are intact enough to retain a pattern 
of information storage. The rest 
are now a kind of homogenous plas- 
tic goo. Most of the intact shields 
border bodies of water, and some 
are actually underwater. Setties can 
detect the presence of intact shields 
by taste. They can’t smell, only 
taste — and taste is one way they 
communicate, through fecal dis- 
charges and pheromones. They can 
tell us about the molecular arrange- 
ments within the Organic Shields as 
efficiently as a good chemical 
analyzer.” 

“There was very little of that in 
the briefings,” Green said. “Has 
anything been deciphered yet?” 

“No — but there is a linguistic 
similarity between the arrangements 
of pocks in the tube walls, and the 
arrangements of molecules. That’s 
what the setties tell us, anyway. 
Some of our computers claim to 
understand what they’re talking 
about. I confess I don’t.” 

“We’ve been having trouble 
lately with setties in the area of the 
Osko Sea,” Berker said. “They 
claim the messages in the shields 
were meant especially for aquatic 
creatures — themselves, I suppose. 
Not for humans. They won’t coop- 
erate with us now.” 

“Billie’s right. There have been 
problems. But they’re not important 
yet. We’ve got enough work to do 
in the vicinity of the Ganset Sea to 



SUN-PLANET 



21 




keep us occupied for a lifetime. 
Now — I think I’ve covered enough 
for the moment. Any questions?” 
“Yes. Wh-what do you expect to 
learn from the information?” 

“I never met a Dark, Comman- 
der. I won’t even venture a guess.” 
“Getting close to Top Level,” 
Neps said. “We’re going to surface 
in about a minute.” 

With Fromm’s aid Korliss trap- 
ped herself in and put her notebook 
in a plastic shoulder-bag. The water 
broke around them and the tuberider 
rocked in its own backwash. 

They were inside a hollow dome. 
Softly glowing lamps circled the 
walls, one of the few artifacts set- 
ties tolerated in their own domains. 
“We’re about six kilometers above 
the crust,” Margul said as he puf- 
fed and wiped his damp forehead. 
“Outside it is very cold and the air 
is thin.” 

“Hollows like this exist through- 
out Water,” Korliss said. “Sandra, 
have the clamps pull the tuberider 
completely out of the pool. The set- 
ties prefer not to hear its presence if 
they can avoid it. The . uh, 
Commander?” 

Green was examining the pock- 
patterns around the inside of the 
chamber. “I’m listening,” he said. 

“The hollows tend to congregate 
more toward the outside of the 
structure. They have pocks just like 
the tubes, as you see.” 

“When are the setties coming?” 
he asked. 

“Any time. Sandra, could you 



get the translator from the 
tuberider?” 

“Yes’m,” Neps said with a 
curtsy. 

“Smart, she is,” Korliss mur- 
mured. “I hope you don’t have 
similar discipline problems, Com- 
mander.” 

It looked more like cameraderie 
than lack of discipline to Green. He 
envied the tenders. “Mr. Berker 
and Mr. Margul have been very 
helpful in hiding my ignorance,” 
Green said. “In fact, you’ve all 
been extremely helpful.” 

“Charming,” Korliss said, smil- 
ing as she looked him over. “Let 
me know if being candid helps you 
as a commander. I’ve often won- 
dered.” 

“Setties coming,” Neps said. 
She hooked the translator to the 
poolside. Distant clicks and groans 
echoed in the hollow dome. 

“What are you going to ask 
them, Commander?” 

“Their estimate on how long be- 
fore they can summarize their find- 
ings.” 

“Tall order, even for setties.” 

“Doesn’t hurt to ask.” 

“No.” 

“Where’s Maday?” Berker asked. 
“We were supposed to meet her 
here.” 

“She could be swimming with 
them,” Korliss said. “Patience, Bil- 
lie. A lot’s been going on lately.” 

The pool rippled, then rose and 
slopped over the platform. Fromm 
clapped his hands sharply, twice,

then snapped his fingers. The setties 
turned their left eyes toward him 
and inclined slowly in his direction. 

“They acknowledge, Kat,” he 

said. 

“Is Maday in the tube below?” 
Korliss asked. 

“She is not,” 

“Where is she?” 

“She is consulting, and will 
speak to you when her work is 
done.” 

Korliss squatted by the edge of 
the platform and motioned for 
(ireen to join her. “F-Nose and 
llaek-Fin, this is the new comman- 
der of the Station, Kenneth Green. 
He has some important questions to 
ask about your studies.” The small, 
clouded eyes turned slightly and 



Green knew he had his audience. 

“Two major questions at the 
moment,” he said. The translator 
trilled in the water. “First, we need 
to know what you’ve learned about 
Sun-Planet, and how soon you can 
reach some useful conclusions. And 
second, we need to know your in- 
tentions should the Perfidisians re- 
turn and replace us here.” 

Berker looked up in surprise. 

“That’s not discreet, Comman- 
der,” Korliss whispered. 

“I haven’t got time for dis- 
discretion.” 

The translator switched with a 
faint click. “This is F-Nose speak- 
ing. Welcome to Sun-Planet, Green. 
May we work well. We can answer 
the first of your two questions. The

second has not been decided yet, 
and at any rate we are not the ones 
to answer it. The woman Maday is 
conferring with those who can an- 
swer, and she will inform you.” 
Green could pick out the F-shaped 
callosities on one settie’s nose. 
“For our answer to your first ques- 
tion we require — much against our 
instincts, but it is necessary — the 
presence of a tool called recorder. 
We do not think you have the 
capacity to absorb all, accurately, in 
the short time given.” 

“I’ll get one,” Neps said, head- 
ing for the tuberider. 

“Looks like they’ve been waiting 
for this,” Berker said to the others. 
“Recorders are especially repugnant 
to them.” 

Korliss saw Green’s puzzled ex- 
pression. “What Billie means, 
Commander, is that they must’ve 
been gearing themselves to answer 
your question for some time now. 
Maday might have known about 
this, but I didn’t.” 

Neps returned with the recorder 
and attached it to the translator. 

“Hack-Fin and the Patris will 
pass on what we know about the 
patterns of Water and the Organic 
Shields,” F-Nose said. “I will give 
a summary. The recorder must take 
down only the full report without 
interruption. You will spend more 
time than usual translating this, la- 
ter, with larger tools. It is very 
complex.” 

“Adjust the recorder, Sandra,” 
Korliss said. 



“All set,” Neps said when she 
was finished. 

The water washed back and forth 
in the tube as the setties re-arranged 
themselves. Hack-Fin and the Patris 
began a susurrus of clicks and 
squeals, barely audible in the air. 

“We have translated some of 
what the Darks left in the tubes of 
Water,” F-Nose said. “We know 
that Water and the Organic Shields 
are similar to reference libraries, 
storage areas for the information 
necessary to translate other coded 
sources.” 

“Other sources?” Green asked. 

“All of Sun-Planet is meaning- 
ful,” the settie said. “This we 
know from understanding the lan- 
guage of Water. There is informa- 
tion stored in the Organic Shields, 
and there is information stored in 
complex wave motions and ... I 
apologize, the words are not im- 
mediately available which can fit 
human language; I will make 
analogies — there are flows and sinks 
and transfers within the mantle 
which cause the crustal plates to 
sing, and information is stored in 
these motions. There are other parts 
which we do not yet comprehend. 
We do not know how much time it 
will take to understand and translate 
all of it, but the major break- 
throughs should be soon, a month 
or two. Hack-Fin is giving you 
what we know already. Taking use- 
ful knowledge away from Sun- 
Planet is father in the future, a year 
or two, perhaps longer.”

“We may not have that much 
time,” Green said. “The Perfidi- 
sians are altfiost certainly going to 
take over Sun-Planet within the next 
year.” 

“What do you expect us to do, 
Green?” 

“Make it known they are return- 
ing. You’ll have to establish a pol- 
icy, and let us know what the pol- 
icy is.” 

“We know, and Maday will give 
our answer. Hack-Fin has finished, 
and the Patris will be done in the 
next few minutes. We are now 
bound for work elsewhere in Wa- 
ter.” F-Nose and Hack-Fin sank 
into the pool. When the Patris had 
completed their segment, they re- 
tracted and the pool was quiet. 
Neps withdrew the recorder from 
the water. 

“Do you know how important 
this is. Commander?” Korliss 
asked, handing the tapas cube to 
him. 

Green did. The thought of the 
consequences made him ill. 

Ill 

Maday was not available within 
the time limit Green had given him- 
self for work outside a protective 
field. He was still very new to 
Sun-Planet, and it would be easy, 
even in an MAS, to overstrain him- 
self. Neps returned them to the ex- 
terior, and Berker and Margul ac- 
companied him to the Station. 

In his quarters, he took an air- 



pressurized shower and put on a 
light uniform, dark blue shorts and 
a sleeveless vegetable-fiber shirt. 
He went to the third floor. 

A JG named Davis was stacking 
the paper offprints of the settie re- 
cording as the computers on the floor 
above translated it. “We have four 
hundred pages for you already, 
Commander,” he said, holding out 
a bound pile. 

“Thank you,” Green said. “How 
much more?” 

“They’re about halfway through. 
This was from a ten-minute record- 
ing?” 

Green nodded. 

“Setties must have been running 
ten channels at once,” Davis said, 
whistling. “It’s amazing the over- 
tones and interphasing they can do 
when they put their minds to it.” 

“I understand from Ms. Korliss 
that their speech takes fifteen di- 
mensions to chart.” 

“That’s right, sir,” David said. 
“About as many as a standard gene- 
tic distribution diagram.” 

Green had seen a computer 
schematic of settie speech before, 
and been struck by the triple-spiral 
complex the screen had shown. 
Now he understood its full use — a 
good-sized literature could be 
passed from one settie to another in 
a few hours. Centuries ago, terres- 
trial whales had broadcast entire 
song traditions in much the same 
way. 

Now the whales were gone. And 
Green was afraid, when this stack 



SUN-PLANET 



25 




of papers reached the Combine, that 
something similar would happen to 
the setties. 

“Next batch, sir,” Davis said. 
The JG was about thirty years old, 
with black hair and a bump of a 
nose on otherwise regular features. 
His duty uniform was rumpled — 
excusable near the end of a 
watch — and despite his cheerful 
tone he looked weary. 

“Have you looked through any of 
these, Mr. Davis?” 

“No, sir. It’s not allowed.” 

“Of course not. This is the only 
hard copy of the translation?” 

“Yes, sir. One set for yourself.” 
“I want the computer room staff 
to lock the databanks and seal them 
so only I can release them. Are they 
the last ones left on watch on these 
floors?” 

“Yessir. The rest are off-duty.” 
“Give them twelve hours liberty 
and thank them for the extra time.” 
“They’ll be obliged, sir.” 

Green took the text with him to 
his quarters. Before he passed the 
information on to the Combine, he 
wanted to make sure he understood 
most of it himself. If he caught 
something erroneous or misleading, 
whether caused by computer misin- 
terpretation or human bungling, it 
would be better to correct it at the 
source, and not through a haze of 
later bureaucratic questions. 

He read through the first fifty 
pages in ten minutes. It was a 
straightforward introduction. The 
prose had an odd flavor, but it was 



clear and concise. If he had time, 
he vowed he’d run a standard lin- 
guist’s reference test through the 
computers to see what they “cor- 
rected,” distorted, or left alone. 
He’d have done it even before run- 
ning the recording through, but 
more important problems prevented 
him. He regretted not having 
enough time — it could lead to 
sloppy work and thinking. He re- 
gretted being sent to Sun-Planet 
without a good, three- month under- 
study program behind him, to 
strengthen his self-confidence. He 
felt like a fool half the time. Well, 
he thought, now was his chance to 
prove himself. 

The next fifty pages were more 
complex. The computer had anno- 
tated much of the text, explaining 
the differences between settie and 
human scientific terminologies. He 
spent an hour on it. It wasn’t terri- 
bly difficult. 

The Organic Shields contained 
long strings of organic molecules 
that played a role in the biochemis- 
try of the life-forms the Darks had 
placed on Sun-Planet. That much 
had been guessed a century before. 
But just what role the molecules 
had played was a more difficult 
question. Now the setties had the 
beginning of an answer. The crea- 
tures had used the long molecules 
as chemical transmitters in their 
nervous systems. But it was incon- 
ceivable that the molecules could 
have provided a uniform stimulus, 
as chemical transmitters did in ter- 



26 



GALAXY 




restrial animals; the molecules were 
too complex Jor a simple binary, 
"fire/no-fire’ 1 response. It was ap- 
parent the stimulus had been con- 
trolled and gradual, with the chemi- 
cals serving as both transmitters and 
a variety of memory. This led the 
setties to speculate that the 
creatures — whether or not they’d 
been the Darks themselves — had 
used taste as a means of communi- 
cation. 

Green closed his eyes for a mo- 
ment. That was all he needed to 
know about the Organic Shields for 
the present. He skipped until he 
found the chapters on Water. 

They were something of a disap- 
pointment. Water had been more 
complex at one time, and may have 
contained information which dupli- 
cated the material in the Organic 
Shields, in a condensed form. The 
setties didn’t suggest a comparison, 
but to Green a card-catalog or tape 
index in a library seemed analog- 
ous. With the death of the tubebor- 
ers, that function had ended. The 
pock-mark patterns in the tubes had 
acted as guides to the tube-borers, 
and also as something similar to 
graffiti, though the setties couldn’t 
find the exact words for the con- 
cept. That unplanned, random sort 
of information was being studied in 
i he hope of finding how the systems 
interacted, and what sort of crea- 
tures worked them. 

Green was four hours into the 
(ext, and two hundred pages, when 
he put the stack down and rubbed 



the bridge of his nose. He was 
exhausted but he couldn’t afford 
sleep. There was too little time left 
for a decision. Was Sun-Planet a 
scrap-heap of useless knowledge, or 
something more? The elaborate 
measures used to store the informa- 
tion suggested secrecy, and to the 
Combine Administers, that would 
smell of importance. Humans had 
the Pandora tendency deeply in- 
grained. He had little doubt the set- 
ties would be killed if the Combine 
considered Sun-Planet important, 
and if there was a chance the Per- 
fidisians would take over before 
humans had extracted the knowl- 
edge. 

As an officer and representative 
of the Astry, rather than a tempo- 
rary civilian position-holder like 
Berker or Margul, he had been given 
all the details about Kerith Post. It 
was more than a crustal monitoring 
station. It was a repository for 
twenty missiles, each carrying a 
warhead filled with pellets of crys- 
tallized tailored plague virus. Each 
pellet carried enough virus to kill a 
tenth of the setties on Sun-Planet. 

If the missiles were launched, 
only the giant skipperjacks and the 
plankton would remain, and even 
they wouldn’t last for long; the loss 
of an important part of the delicate 
ecology would soon bring all life on 
Sun-Planet back to ground zero. By 
law, artificial ecological systems 
had built-in safeguards which auto- 
matically prevented uncontrolled 
evolution. 



SUN-PLANET

Within a few decades, Sun-Planet 
would be sterile. 

The papers slid off his stomach 
onto the floor. He reached down to 
pick them up and lifted his eyes at 
the sound of the intercom bleeping. 
“I’ll answer,” he told the vox ac- 
tivator. 

“Commander, this is Berker. 
Sorry to interrupt your sleep — ” 

“I w-wasn’t sleeping, M-Mister 
Berker. What’s up?” 

“Communications has a message 
from an Astry ship on the systems 
perimeter. The Perfidisians are 
broadcasting a warning. We’ll get it 
in a few hours — they’re sending it 
across status geometry. They re- 
quest all occupants of worlds along 
the Eridanus Line to evacuate. 
They’ll be here in two weeks.” The 
message had to be directed at Sun- 
Planet; there was no way a status- 
geometry signal could cover the 
Eridanus Line in time to serve any 
purpose. The Perfidisian ships had 
probably transmitted from a few 
light-days away. 

“Commander, should this be kept 
secret for the moment?’ ’ 

“No, Mr. Berker. Home field re- 
ceivers will pick up the message 
anyway. Call a meeting of all offi- 
cers and civilian reps for an hour 
from now. I want Home Field reps, 
too — and get me the tenders Kor- 
liss, Maday, Fromm and Neps.” 
“Yes, Commander. Is that all?” 
“For the moment, Mr. Berker. 
Thank you.” 

“No thanks needed for bad news, 
28 



Commander, ’ ’ Berker replied quietly . 

He switched the inducer to forty- 
five minutes of accelerated sleep. 
Then he lay back and closed his 
eyes. When the signal buzzed he 
was still tired, and his eyes ached. 

IV 

The meeting room was spare and 
utilitarian. The chairs were thinly 
padded and somewhat uncomforta- 
ble, the lighting white and harsh. 
People were meant to be ill at ease 
here. The room was used only for 
trouble talks. When Green arrived, 
half the people he'd requested were 
present. The others, Margul ex- 
plained, were on their way and 
would be arriving in ten or fifteen 
minutes. The Home Field reps 
would be the latest. 

“Well, the ones we need most 
are already here,” Green said. 
“Could you point out Maday?” 

Margul indicated a woman sitting 
at the table. She was young, with a 
thin, pinched face and hair cut 
short. Her skin was almost white. 
She was looking down at the table- 
top and manipulating something 
small with her fingers. 

Green took his seat at the head of 
the table and requested a playback 
of the Astry’s message. When it 
was finished, he gave a quick out- 
line of what the setties had reported 
on their work with the Dark ar- 
tifacts. He then turned to Maday 
and asked her what the setties had 
decided. 

She straightened her shoulders 

GALAXY 




and folded her hands on the table. 
‘They’ve decided not to work with 
the Perfidistans should they take 
over Sun-Planet. They’ve had ex- 
perience with them and on the 
whole they prefer humans.” 

“Have they any p-plans for or- 
ganized resistance?” 

“No resistance. Things will pro- 
ceed normally, but they won’t let 
anything they know be passed on.” 

“All setties are unanimous about 
that?”' 

i i 

>Ntaday hesitated. “I don’t 
know.”_ 

“You’re doubtful about the Osko 
Sea setties?” 

“I haven’t heard from any of 
their packs.” 

“You understand how crucial this 
is, Maday?” 

“I do. Commander. I’m willing 
to bet the Combine Astry has a 
quick scheme for the extermination 
of the setties, should there be any 
chance the Perfidisians will get ac- 
cess to the information stored on 
Sun-Planet.” 

“What can we do to avoid that, 
if it’s true?” 

Maday shrugged. “Setties are as 
complex as humans, if not more so. 

I cannot honestly vouch for every 
settie, much less for any group of 
setties claiming kinship with the 
Darks. I’m afraid the decision still 
rests with you, Commander.” 

“Do the setties have any plans 
for policing themselves, if the Per- 
fidisians take over?” 

“If you mean, would they be wil- 



ling to silence the Osko Sea group, 
no. Setties are incapable of killing 
their own kind, or interfering with 
the beliefs of adult individuals in 
any way.” 

“Even if it should mean the end 
of all of them, and their work?” 

“That’s the way they operate,” 
Berker said. 

“Mr. Berker, what do you rec- 
ommend?” Perhaps that would get 
a rise out of the tenders. Green 
could almost cut the air between 
Maday and the thin man. 

Berker opened his mouth, then 
shut it. He shook his head. “I have 
to go along with the Combine’s or- 
ders. For the moment, you’re their 
representative. It’s your decision.” 

Green felt his face redden. 
“You’re p-putting me in a 
d-difficult position. I’ve worked my 
ass off trying to 1-learn enough 
about Sun-Planet to be reasonably 
in-informed. I haven’t reached that 
p-point yet. If I do not have your 
cooperation, we’ll all tr-be in very 
serious trouble. I might make the 
wrong choice. And it does boil 
d-down to two choices.” 

“Nobody asked for central au- 
thority under the Combine Astry,” 
Maday said. “It was imposed on 
us.” 

“Nor d-did I ask to be sent 
here!” Green said loudly. He low- 
ered his voice and bent his head 
slightly. “In your opinion, is the in- 
formation c-contained on Sun-Planet 
of any use to an intelligent species 
bent on aggression and conquest?” 



SUN-PLANET 



29 




Maday waited for the others to 
speak before answering. No one 
did. “Yes, it could be,” she said. 
“Any information can be turned 
into weapons, given the right frame 
of mind.” 

“Then I am f-fully justified in 
believing there’s a possibility the 
Perfidisians will have access to in- 
formation which can distinctly 
change the balance of their dealings 
with humans and other intelligent 
species?” 

Maday nodded. Green was 
momentarily disappointed in her — 
either she was hiding behind a 
facade, or she was far less decisive 
than he’d been led to believe. 

Berker leaned forward in his seat 
next to Green. “The Commander 
has the ability to destroy all the set- 
ties on Sun-Planet within twenty 
hours,” he said. “It’s a power 
Margul and I were not given during 
our brief command. Nor do we 
know precisely how he can do it — 
only that he can.” 

“The setties already know how it 
can be done, and so do I,” Maday 
said. “There are concentrations of 
Astry personnel and computers in 
many areas across Sun-Planet. 
There is only one position made up 
entirely of computers, and that is 
Kerith Post on Laith Island. We as- 
sume that’s where you keep your 
weapons. Specific disease activity is 
the quickest and most selective 
method of killing large populations. 
I assume you have vector 
mechanisms loaded with something 



akin to pulmonary chancre virus, 
specific to cetaceans and tailored to 
setties.” 

Green was not surprised at the 
accuracy of her guess. “I’ll be 
forced to release those vector 
mechanisms soon, unless someone 
can give me excellent and compel- 
ling reasons n-not to. Maday, I ex- 
pect you’ve already discussed this 
with your settie contacts.” 

“With my friends and colleagues, 
yes.” 

“And they’re willing to sac- 
rifice?” 

“Commander, style of living is 
all-important to the setties. They 
can’t be as self-deceptive as hu- 
mans. If they break their code of 
ethics, they literally cannot live 
with themselves. But I’m not cer- 
tain you have only one choice in 
this case.” She was struggling to 
say something; her lips were con- 
torting, and her face was paler than 
before. 

“What other choices do I have?” 
“The — the Osko Sea groups oc- 
cupy a relatively small area, and 
they’re compacted. I — ” 

“Mr. Berker, i-is that feasible 
with weapons in open stock?” 
“What, Commander?” 

“Selective extinction of a settie 
population.” 

“No, sir.” 

“Maday, I commend your cour- 
age for making the suggestion, but 
it is not feasible.” 

“Do you know what we’re dis- 
cussing, Green?” Maday asked. 



30 



GALAXY 




“Genocide. Do humans have that 
right?” 

Green’s hands were trembling 
and he put them under the table. 
“What we’re discussing is the 
p-possibility . the possible ex- 
tinction of th-the human race.” 

“The Perfidisians would never be 
allowed to go that far!” 

The P-Perfidisians may not be 
controllable if they have access to 
the information on Sun- Planet.” 
“You are willing to destroy — ” 
“Y-Yes!” Green shouted, his 
voice breaking. “Yes, I have that 
obligation, that duty to uphold my 
commands, no matter what they 
mean in terms of civilian morality! 
That may sound incredibly callous 
to all of you here, but it isn’t quite 
the same th-thing as a selfish desire 
to avoid trouble by obeying orders. 
My people, my race, are threatened 
by this situation!” 

The conference room was silent. 
“Then, Commander, from an 
aesthetic argument, who is more 
worthy of being saved, the setties or 
the—” 

Green saw that Maday was close 
to breaking down, but his anger at 
her stupidity was too great to take 
frailties into consideration. His dis- 
appointment ran deep. In Maday, he 
had hoped for some sort of logical 
ally, someone who could work with 
him and with the setties, acting as a 
mediator, in order that some other 
solution might be found. Now his 
frustration exploded. “You 
megalomaniac bastard! You’d ask 

32 



anyone to make that sort of 
choice?” 

Maday began to weep. Beside 
him, Berker was jerking strangely, 
like a puppet held by a spastic mas- 
ter. Margul held his head low, but 
was looking around through small 
eyes. 

“I apologize,” Green said on an 
intake of breath. “I — God damn, I 
apologize for the outburst, not for 
the sentiment behind it.” 

The door to the conference room 
opened and the remaining reps en- 
tered, looking around warily. They 
could sense the meeting’s highly- 
charged air, and were reluctant to 
intrude. 

“S-sit down, gentlemen,” Green 
said to the men and women “We 
are finding quick w-ways to com- 
mend ourselves to hell.” 

V 

Fifteen thousand kilometers above 
Sun-Planet, four Astry ships orbited 
in close formation, waiting for the 
signal to begin evacuation of the 
human population. They were huge 
personnel carriers, each capable of 
supporting a hundred thousand 
people for a short time. They had 
been converted from colonizers and 
were about forty years old, ap- 
proaching the end of a standard 
warper-ship’s lifetime. They were 
visible from the surface as bloated 
stars. Green watched them from the 
observation hall as they rose above 
the horizon clouds. 

It would take a week to evacuate 

GALAXY 




the three hundred and fifty thousand 
humans, and the whole thing would 
begin in three standard days — about 
one rotation for Sun-Planet. A few 
would stay behind, including Green. 
They would^leave later — or they 
might not ldave at all. There was 
;i possibility the Perfidisians would 
allow a provisional supervisory 
group of humans until all avenues 
of diplomacy were exhausted. 

If things worked out as he plan- 
ned, he’d be cutting things very 
close. But it had to be that way. 
Most of the setties had pledged 
themselves to their human over- 
seers. That deserved more than 
quick and desperate extermination. 

The ships twinkled in the heat ris- 
ing from the cleft in the crustal 
shields. Green looked down toward 
the clouds to see the peak of Water. 

He was expecting an answer from 
Myriadne any time. Coded outlines 
of the settie findings had been sent 
two dayS before. He was fairly cer- 
tain what the answer would be — 
nothing to cheer Maday or anyone 
else. There were times when he 
hated his position. Hated himself. 

He closed his eyes and thought 
about the pamphlet he had in his 
room. The youthful, green pioneer 
worlds, far from the inter-species 
disputes, begging for more human 
colonists; fresh starts, with ample 
land and enormous growth poten- 
tial . They were too far away to 
even dream about now, but still the 
dream existed, another part of the 
dichotomy. 



With it came the vision of a 
woman who would explore with 
him, bear him children far from the 
typical restrictions imposed on 
families. She would not necessarily 
be beautiful — Green knew he was 
no prize for handsomeness him- 
self — but strong and loving and 
intelligent, the sort of beauty that 
overcame physical form, or glowed 
through it. 

Instead, he was facing the 
bizarre, dark surface of Sun-Planet. 
Despite its reputation for instability, 
this world would outlast himself and 
many civilizations, even species. 
Living things were the instabilities, 
the unfaithful of time. All their 
problems were trivial. A memory of 
a similar feeling projected itself 
briefly and then eluded him. 

“Commander,” Berker called 
from the opposite end of the hall. 
“We have the reply, for your ears 
only.” 

He went to listen. Five minutes 
later, he left the communications 
center and told Berker to join him 
in his cabin. His plans were crystal- 
lizing. There wasn’t much time 
left — a day or two at the most. He 
was going to take a final chance, 
and go to the Osko Sea to converse 
with the setties there. Maday had to 
go with him, and Korliss, Neps and 
Fromm. The older tenders were log- 
ical choices, but the younger two 
were more of a whim. Green found 
strength in their youth and 
straightforward affection, and he 
needed all his strength now. 



SUN-PLANET

Berker entered Green’s cabin and 
listened intently as the commander 
told him his plans. Instructions 
would be left in the emergency or- 
ders capsule in Station Security. If 
he didn’t return, it was Berker’s re- 
sponsibility to activate the vector 
missiles. Green was almost light- 
headed at the prospect of having 
something very nearly positive to 
do, and he put a call through on his 
intercom requesting the four tenders 
to return to the Station and bring 
appropriate equipment with them. 

“I’m not sure this is wise, Com- 
mander,” Berker said, following 
him to the locks. “You’ll have to 
stay in your MAS all the way, and 
tuberider seats aren’t the most com- 
fortable places to be in a suit. But 
even so, you’ll — ” 

“Get damned tired, I’m sure,” 
Green broke in. “I’ll just have to 
put up with it.” 

Berker looked upset. “That 
leaves everything in my hands if 
you don’t get back.” 

“I’m not sneaking out from 
under it,” Green said. He looked at 
Berker’s downcast, lined face and 
smiled faintly. “As long as we can 
communicate, you’ll need my 
command to start things rolling. 
Only if something happens to 
me — and Sun-Planet isn’t all that 
wild — only then are you responsible. 
You’re no more put- upon than I am, 
Mr. Berker.” 

“It’s not a matter of being put- 
upon,” Berker said, looking in- 
sulted. 



“The hell it isn’t. I know exactly 
what it is. All of this is on our 
backs now. You told me the setties 
would turn traitor given half a 
chance. Do you still believe that?” 

Berker nodded. 

“Might be a dangerous senti- 
ment, Mr. Berker. D-don’t jump the 
gun. If you d-do, remember — 
responsibility is a t-two edged 
sword.” He cursed the returning 
stutter. “Depending on the cir- 
circumstances, you’ll be damned if 
you do, damned if you don’t.” 

“I commanded the Station long 
enough to learn the meaning of re- 
sponsibility,” Berker said. “I’m 
going to communications to super- 
vise the evacuation of Home Field, 
sir.” 

“Then good luck, to both of us, 
Mr. Berker. We’re very reluctant 
bedfellows, believe' me.” Berker 
frowned without understanding, 
then turned and left. Green collided 
with Margul in the hatch to the 
locks. Margul apologized quietly, 
his small eyes squinting as he 
looked at the commander. 

Green briefed him and told him 
to keep a careful watch on every- 
thing. Margul accompanied him to 
the dock, matching his long strides 
with difficulty. 

“Commander Green,” he said, 
“is it wise to give Berker such 
powers?” 

“Berker’s the only one I can give 
them to.” 

“But there is something you 
should know about him.” 



34 



GALAXY 




“What?” 

“Berker worked with the setties 
for several years, but he doesn’t 
like them. He was a tender eleven 
years ago. The setties would not 
work with Jtim because of his per- 
sonality, and he had to come to the 
Station.” 

“Will that cloud his judgement 

here?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“I’ve got to go to the Osko Sea, 
Mr. Margul. You are second in 
command only so long as you feel 
Mr. Berker is following my orders. 
I’ll brief you both thoroughly before 
I go.” 

“Why not just pass it on to me, 
Commander?” 

“The command?” 

“Yes.” 

“Because Berker has shown no 
signs of not being able to obey or- 
ders, and he is your acting 
superior.” Green looked Margul 
over sharply. “Or is th-there some- 
thing else, Mister?” 

“No.” 

The locks were as warm and 
humid as ever. Green sat in the 
brightly-lit engineer’s booth, tap- 
ping his fingers impatiently on the 
small desk. The engineer stepped in 
and greeted him stiffly, pulling gum 
out of his mouth and sticking it in 
the disposal. “Tuberider’s coming 
down the canal now,” he said, 
looking over the displays. 

Fromm escorted Maday into the 
booth. She looked at Green through 
tired, half-shut eyes, slightly 



stooped, her hands limp by her 
sides. “Still holding out hope, 
Commander?” she asked, her low 
voice deceptively mild. 

Green nodded. 

“What are you going to do?” 

“You’ll find out as soon as all 
the others are here.” 

The locks opened and the 
tuberider entered, piloted by Neps 
with Korliss as a passenger. The 
vessel docked and the engineer gave 
them the okay to board. 

“We have our orders,” Green 
told them as they climbed in and 
took their seats. He put his MAS on 
while standing in the hatch, then 
climbed awkwardly into his seat and 
strapped himself in. “We’re going 
to find out just how rebellious the 
Osko Sea setties are. If they won’t 
cooperate, we’ll have to carry out 
the second stage of the orders. But 
for the moment, we’re acting on a 
good-faith assumption. I’d like 
Maday to ask four setties to go 
along with us — those you think can 
communicate best with the Osko 
Sea patris. If one or more of them 
is also an expert on the overall 
meaning of Sun-Planet, well and 
good. The orders instruct us to in- 
vestigate two artifacts we’ve paid 
little attention to so far.” 

Maday looked across the 
tuberider cabin at him. “Which are 
those?” 

“Wormways and Crooked 
Shield.” 

“They’re tabu areas for setties,” 
she said. 



SUN-PLANET 



35 




“All the m-more reason to inves- 
tigate. We don’t have time to be 
diplomatic.” 

“The areas are tabu because 
they’re dangerous,” Maday said, 
still dead-pan. 

“Yes, but there’s no evidence 
they’re physically dangerous. You 
should all be acquainted with Stefan 
Damal’s studies on pattern- 
generated psychoses.” 

“I’m not,” Fromm and Neps 
said simultaneously. 

“We all have specific fear reac- 
tions,” Green said. “They can be 
generated by c-complex situations, 
anything from nightmares to battles. 
They can also be generated sublimi- 
nally by such things as smells, but 
we tend to consciously suppress 
these responses. However, there are 
culture-wide fear generators which 
can send some species into wild 
panic. Humans still react to stories 
of ghosts and demons. Most ani- 
mals respond to varieties of fear 
generators, but aquatic animals are 
especially sensitive. Cetaceans on 
Earth evolved from land animals, 
but in their ocean environment they 
picked up the responses of sea crea- 
tures. The setties probably have 
similar reactions.” He was usually 
good at reciting material from text 
without stammering, and the 
number of clear sentences he pro- 
duced was gratifying. The material 
wasn’t his own, after all — no 
dichotomy involved. “A pattern- 
generated psychosis is a response to 
continuous exposure to a fear 

36 



generator. A specific sound fre- 
quency might touch off panic be- 
cause of association with wounded 
animals thrashing — or the sounds 
used by predators during attack. A 
baleine whale bom in captivity and 
educated by humans will still be 
badly frightened if he hears vibra- 
tions associated with the swimming 
of killer whales — subtle sensations 
most of our mechanisms can barely 
detect. Visual and taste stimuli can 
also cause panic. Whole herds of 
whales on Earth used to beach 
themselves, and the reason wasn’t 
fully understood for centuries. They 
were panicked by unusual ripple ef- 
fects in the ocean surface, or by the 
dumping of garbage and industrial 
wastes — both of which triggered 
fear- responses.” 

“So you think the tabu areas are 
regions of pattern- gene rated fear?” 
Fromm asked. 

“Sounds likely. They both have 
peculiar geological features. There 
might even be unpleasant combina- 
tions of organic molecules. Crooked 
Shield is crooked because of an 
upwelling in the mantle, and the 
whole area is hotter than normal — a 
kitchen for c-cooking up strange 
brews, n-no?” 

“There are some areas around 
Water that smell creepy,” Fromm 
said. “But I guess setties wouldn’t 
feel the same way I do.” 

“You’re expecting the setties to 
follow us into these zones?” Maday 
asked. 

“No. But I want them to be 

GALAXY 




ready to look at recorded surveys. 
I’ve ordered a taste analyzer instal- 
led. That’s what we’re waiting for 
now. We’ll make records from that, 
too. If there are a few brave setties 
in our bunch, they can volunteer to 
experience the tastes of the areas. 
But at the very least, they have to 
give us some idea how the tabu re- 
gions tie in with the rest of Sun- 
Planet.” 

“There might be a few willing,” 
Maday said. 

The engineer’s voice boomed 
from the lock intercom system. 
“Mr. Margul is here with the taste 
analyzer.” 

The man carried the small pack- 
age down the hatch and handed it to 
Fromm, who carried it forward and 
mounted it in an equipment bay. 

“Thank you, Mr. Margul. Mr. 
Fromm, seal us and we’ll be on our 
way.” 

“Our wishes go with you,” Mar- 
gul said from the dock. There was a 
peculiar catch in his voice that 
made Green play it back in his head 
several times. 

The hatch swung down and 
locked. Neps wound up the motors 
and engaged the propellers and 
water-jets. The tuberider swung 
away from the dock and left the 
lock, heading down the canal to the 
Ganset Sea. Fromm went over a 
last-minute checklist with Neps, and 
Green listened as he closed his eyes 
and angled his seat back. The rear 
support strut of the MAS dug into 
his butt slightly, but it wasn’t un- 



comfortable for the moment. 

“Sixty hours motor time with the 
extra batteries. We’ve got — 
um . five gallons extra electro- 
lyte and caulking material in case of 
crystal build-up. Oxygen — six 
tanks, enough for forty hours for 
each of us in emergency. Food and 
water for six days. Drug kit — ” 

“Ms. Maday,” Green said. 
“When we’re in open sea, send 
your request to Water.” He closed 
his eyes again and drifted off. He 
hadn’t had a decent sleep since he’d 
arrived, and now he let the extra 
weight pull him down without re- 
sisting. Even with the MAS, the 
pressure holding him in the padding 
was almost soothing. His eyeballs 
felt heavy and his eyelids didn’t fly 
open so easily. He slept. 

“Korliss, we have two setties 
starboard,” Maday said. 

Green came awake and looked 
around slowly. Maday was looking 
through her port. “Can you identify 
them?” Korliss asked. 

“They’re turning toward us now. 
It’s a bit murky. F-Nose and To- 
moye, I think. Yes. They’re more 
tolerant than the others. They’ll stay 
close to the tuberider. Anything on 
sonar?” 

“Two more setties ahead,” Neps 
said. “Big ones. Patris. Did you 
ask Water to send any pack lead- 
ers?” 

“I didn’t,” Maday said. “But 
that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t de- 
cide for themselves. I’m sure they 
know how important this is.” 



SUN-PLANET 



37 




Green had a paranoid thought, 
then dismissed it. There wasn’t 
much the setties could do in the 
way of defense, much less offense. 
The tuberider could be damaged, 
but his own death would only cinch 
the destruction of the setties, and he 
was reasonably sure they knew that 
by now, too. Maday had probably 
told them a lot more than Green 
would have allowed, had he the 
power. “Where are we now?’’ he 
asked. 

“Ganset Sea, fifteen kilometers 
by twenty-two degrees from Laith 
Beacon,” Neps said. “We’re pas- 
sing along a sea-wall.” 

Green’s experience of multitudes 
of worlds had never accustomed 
him to the diversity and area of 
even a small planet’s surface. The 
cliffs which passed a half kilometer 
away were twenty kilometers tall, 
rugged as the slopes of volcanoes, 
and a shiny reddish-black in color. 
They stretched from horizon to 
horizon and were pitted with caves 
of sufficient size and area to ac- 
commodate a large percentage of 
the population of Earth. A vague, 
muddy snow began at the five 
kilometer level, and ended at ten 
kilometers, where atmospheric 
moisture stopped. 

“Have setties ever used the caves 
below the water line?” Green 
asked. 

“Some have been explored,” 
Korliss said. “But these are crustal 
shield material. The setties are in- 
terested in organic formations.” 



“I’ve heard there are skipperjack 
nests in the caves,” Fromm said. 
“Makes it undesirable to go near 
them. The beaches on the flats 
northwest of here are littered with 
cuttlebones, where the current 
dredges them from the sea-bottom 
and washes them ashore.” 

“Setties send out their hunting 
parties to a point about ten kilo- 
meters east,” Korliss said. “That’s a 
skipperjack feeding ground. The 
hunters fight them there, kill them, 
and bring them back whole. Then 
the packs gather around for ritual 
feeding, about once every standard 
week.” 

“How many setties are killed in 
the hunts?” 

“None,” Maday broke in. “The 
skipperjacks are tailored not to re- 
sist predators armed with specific 
attack strategies. If the setties 
weren’t restrained by ritual, the 
skipperjacks would probably be ex- 
tinct by now.” 

“But they’re afraid to let them 
into the settie nurseries?” 

“With good reason,” Korliss 
said. “Young setties don’t know 
how to attack, and they’re small 
enough that a skipperjack can kill 
them with beak or tentacles. The 
skipperjacks get most of their food 
from seining plankton, but they 
haven’t lost all desire lor large 
prey. The genetic engineers didn’t 
iron out all the kinks — on purpose, 
I imagine; a little conflict and f lex i- 
bility keeps both species alert.” 
Fromm passed around lunch kits 



38 



GALAXY 




and their choice of one of six meal 
packets. Green chose a synthecarn 
salad, which tasted adequately fresh 
when vivified. 

The lavatory facilities were 
cramped but adequate. Green had 
long since lost afiy particular desire 
for private facilities in his Astry 
career, but those used to staying in 
the Home Field — Neps in 
particular — found the situation 
awkward. Fromm kidded her, but 
stopped after the tuberider bucked 
in a sudden current while he was 
urinating. He had to clean up the 
mess and shower down amid jocular 
abuse about his terrible aim. 

The connection between the Gan- 
set and Osko Seas was a broad 
sweep of shallow water — no more 
than ten meters deep — studded with 
small, mushroom-shaped islands. 
Korliss called them “nodes.” Most 
were made of organic shield mate- 
rial which had accreted in the chan- 
nel over thousands of centuries. 
Some had collected beaches of 
sandy particles in the lee of predom- 
inant currents, and Neps pointed 
out a few bleached cuttlebones 
above the water line. 

A few minutes into the channel a 
squall broke, and Fromm dove the 
tuberider beneath the surface to es- 
cape the barrage of hail. Koestler 
broke the clouds an hour later and 
added a blue-green glimmer to the 
water above, not enough to light 
their way. Young skipperjacks, no 
more than a meter or two long, fre- 
quently flared in the lamplights and 



jetted away. To Green, the whole 
universe seemed heavy and fluid 
and dark. He stayed awake to keep 
Fromm alert while the others slept, 
and idly considered the alternatives 
to his present course of action. 

“Osko Sea Shield edge ahead,” 
Fromm said. “Green looked 
through his water-smeared port as 
the tuberider surfaced. The pale 
daylight glinted from the ragged 
slopes of the jade-green cliffs. 
There wasn’t much difference be- 
tween these cliffs and the sea-wall, 
except for color. But this was where 
an organic shield ground up against 
a crustal shield; there were forces 
pent up beneath them which were 
awesome even to a former warper- 
ship captain. 

A murmur of settie language 
came through the tuberider hull as 
the translator hummed its message 
signal. Fromm switched it on. 

“This is F-Nose. Contact made 
with Osko Sea groups. Follow Pat- 
ris and proceed at half speed.” 

“How can they contact the others 
without our translator listening in?” 
Green asked. 

“Probably by taste-trails,” 
Maday said, swinging her seat up. 
Korliss yawned and shook Neps 
awake. “Either that, or subsonic 
bass tones out of our translator’s 
range . ’ ’ 

“How far to Crooked Shield?” 

“About twenty kilometers,” 
Fromm said, after consulting a chart 
on the guidance display. “We could 
make it in forty minutes.” 



SUN-PLANET

Green looked at Maday with 
hands folded under his chin. 
“When do you think we should in- 
vestigate Crooked Shield and 
Worm ways?” 

“That’s up to you, Commander. 
Our setties have probably already 
arranged a meeting with the Osko 
Sea groups.” 

“But there are no restrictions on 
associating with people who violate 
a tabu area.” 

“No. Setties aren’t concerned 
with the foolishness of others — no 
slight intended.” 

“Perhaps they understand the 
tabu can’t hurt humans,” Green of- 
fered. 

“That’s possible. Personally, I’m 
not sure your theory is correct. For 
one reason or another, no one’s 
ever visited Wormways, and only 
one or two sorties have been made 
over Crooked Shield. There may be 
more there than a fly-over can de- 
tect.” 

“I have reason to b-believe 
Counselor-Administer Krutch is ad- 
vising the Astry Execustaff on 
Sun-Planet. He was Governor of 
Home Field for twenty years before 
accepting the appointment to 
Myriadne, wasn’t he?” 

Maday nodded. “A good ad- 
ministrator, but not much on public 
relations. You think he’s the one 
asking us to investigate the tabu 
zones?” 

“I have my hunches,” Green 
said. 

“Representatives from nine packs 



are swimming to meet us,” the 
translator said. “This is Tomoye 
speaking. May we know who will 
address them?” 

Green glanced at Maday, who 
was leaning forward in her seat to 
look through the bubble. “Tell 
him — ” he began. 

“Her,” Korliss corrected. 

“ — her that I’ll address them. 
Tell them we have two master ten- 
ders on board, also.” 

Fromm relayed the message. To- 
moye instructed them to slow the 
tuberider and bring it into a small 
bay along the Osko Shield edge. 
That maneuver took twenty minutes. 
When the tuberider was rocking 
in a slow, calm swell, Neps stepped 
up into the vertical wing and pop- 
ped the hatch. 

Choosing his footing carefully, 
Green left his seat and climbed out 
to stand on the ribbed deck sur- 
rounding the wing. He swung his 
arms briefly to orient the MAS on 
his body, then faced the warm wind 
coming from the north. Korliss 
pointed out the flat plumes of two 
setties breeching. The little bay was 
about a kilometer long and two 
hundred meters wide. The odor of 
the organic shield material was 
strong and oily-dusty in his nose. 
The water of the Osko Sea smelled 
different — richer and more saturated 
with nutrients. It was like being in a 
giant petrochemical plant. 

A few strands of seaweed and 
some globs of larger plankton were 
bobbing in the bay. Neps hi ought 



40 



GALAXY 




out a small net on a telescoping 
tube and caught one of the globs, 
hoisting it for Green to examine. 

“These are like jelly beans to a 
skipperjack,” she said. “The sili- 
cate shell keeps the pressurized pro- 
toplasm bottled up. A skipperjack 
brings clusters in with its seining 
anus, then cracks the shells with its 
beak. They’re single-celled phyto- 
plankton, but they use something 
akin to the visual purple in our eyes 
to photosynthesize the weak light, 
instead of clorophyll. Look around 
the edge — here and here — these red 
spots. It’s symbiotic with barnacle- 
like creatures. They guarantee its 
supply of nutrients, since it can’t 
rely entirely on dissolved organic 
matter and sunlight. The barnacles 



ingest passing foodstuffs, then 
empty their wastes outside the nut- 
rient intakes. Koestler isn’t strong 
enough to support a purely photo- 
synthetic plant ecology, so the soup 
in the oceans is usually symbiotic.’’ 

* 'Commander, the pack represen- 
tatives are about a hundred yards 
east of us,’’ Maday said 

“They request that all major 
equipment be shut down and the use 
of hand tools kept to a minimum.” 
“Cut the motors, then. Let’s get 
this net below.” 

“There’s going to be more rol- 
ling with the gyros off, so watch 
your footing,” Maday warned. The 
mechanical sounds of the tuberider 
subsided. Green spotted a collection 
of subsurface shadows accompanied 





by rolling slicks of water and bub- 
bling turbulence. 

“These packs are even more sen- 
sitive about tools than our setties,” 
Fromm said. “Fanatics, almost.” 
“They’re ready to talk,” Maday 
announced, handing Neps a mi- 
crophone from the translator below. 
“They’ve given me their names.” 
Green held the microphone to his 
lips. “We’d like to talk to someone 
well versed concerning the last Per- 
fidisian occupation.” 

The translator’s twitter went out, 
and a deeper answer returned. 

“This is H- Arrow, addressing the 
Stumble- Speaker.” Neps suppressed 
a smile with one hand. 

“Word gets around fast,” Korliss 
said. 

“What do your packs plan to do 
if the Perfidisians occupy Sun- 
Planet again?” Green asked. 

“The plans were made many 
years ago, when our packs gathered 
in this sea to concentrate our study. 
We will deal with them the same 
way we did the first time. They ig- 
nored us, and we ignored them.” 
Green raised his eyebrows. “H- 
Arrow, our records show that much 
information was passed to the Per- 
fidisians.” 

“They were curious about human 
behavior. They did not consult us 
on other matters.” 

“Excuse me,’’ Maday inter- 
rupted, shutting off the translator. 
“Commander, different groups re- 
port what happened different ways. 
Most of the Osko Sea packs were in 



a relatively hidden stretch of the 
Lambda Sea at the time.” 

“I’m aware of that,” Green said 
testily. Maday shrugged and re- 
stored the link. “H- Arrow, this is 
Stumble-Speaker. I have informa- 
tion which leads me to believe the 
Perfidisians are interested in 
m-more than just human behavior. 
What will you do if they question 
you about Sun-Planet?” 

“There should be no cause for 
fear. We believe Sun-Planet was 
made for creatures such as our- 
selves, not for anyone else. There is 
much evidence supporting our be- 
lief. We will maintain our discretion 
with the Ones Who Hide.” 

“Translator off,’’ Green re- 
quested. “Maday, please announce 
yourself and tell them that’s not 
good enough. We need to know 
what the Osko Sea packs have dis- 
covered, and soon — at least in out- 
line form.” 

Maday identified herself and 
passed the request on. She looked at 
Green with a faintly bitter expres- 
sion. 

“We will never reveal those 
things to beings not made to accept 
them,” H- Arrow replied. 

“This is Stumble-Speaker. 
There’s every chance the Ones 
Who Hide will try to break your 
wills to get any information you 
have. How can you guarantee they 
won’t succeed?” 

There was silence for a moment, 
“No effort was made the last 
time.” 



42 



GALAXY 




“No, because you were far from 
any sort of solution. Now we know 
you’re very close. To get the solu- 
tion from you, the Perfidisians 
might do anything.” 

Another pause. * k Our memories 
do not give us the same impres- 
sion ” 

Green removed a sheet of paper 
from his breast pocket and passed it 
down to Maday. “Read that to 
them,’’ he said. “Look at the 
seal — it’s official, and secret to all 
but top clearance Astry and Com- 
bine officers. You recognize the 
seal?” 

Maday nodded. “Thin Hand 
speaking,” she said. “I have a rec- 
ord of what happened to a group of 
non-human, intelligent beings 
known to us as Aighors. Their 
spaceship was disabled and captured 
oy the Ones Who Hide.” She read 
through the gory details quickly and 
sharply. The pause in translation 
was even longer this time. 

“Why did they do that?” Neps 
asked . 

“Because the Perfidisians were 
interested in an Aighor weapon sys- 
tem. The Aighors used the weapon 
to protect their home systems, but a 
few decades ago they became more 
belligerent and started expanding. 
The Perfidisians didn’t get the se- 
cret, but they were up against be- 
ings a hell of a lot tougher than set- 
ties.” 

“What was the weapon?’’ 
Fromm asked. Green looked as- 
kance at him. 



“Do you have evidence they are 
desperate enough to do such things 
to us?” H- Arrow finally responded. 

“I do,” Green said. 

“But the information is not easily 
translated, and it does not come in 
the form of a compact solution. Nor 
is it technologically oriented. How 
could it be, when we feel it is ad- 
dressed to our kind alone?” 

Green thought that over for a 
moment, then decided the Execu- 
staff would still be unsatisfied. “It’s 
imperative for us to know the im- 
pact your findings might have on 
mental attitudes. When the attitudes 
of technological beings change, so 
do their technologies. In the long 
run, the purest of philosophies and 
theoretical sciences can be turned 
into tools, and these tools can be 
used as weapons.” 

There was a silence of about a 
minute. “This is H- Arrow. We un- 
derstand your difficulty, and we 
hope you understand ours. We are 
under a sacred obligation to keep 
our findings within the circle of our 
kind. Our obligation to humans is 
great, but we firmly believe neither 
you nor the Ones Who Hide could 
have any use for what we have 
learned. We cannot serve you. We 
will be just as adamant with any 
other species.” 

The dark shapes began to move 
away from the tuberider. 

“That’s it,” Maday said. 

“How in hell do they know what 
we can and can’t use? They 
h-haven’t any idea — ”

The sky brightened and the hu- 
mans shielded their eyes against the 
glare. The effect was un- 
mistakable — Green recognized it 
immediately. When the glow sub- 
sided. he looked up and saw four 
bright blue crescents surrounding 
the speck of Koestler. The light was 
four to eight hours old. The ships 
wouldn’t be far behind. 

“That’s the receiving end of a 
Perfidisian warp,” he said. “We’ve 
got two or three hours before their 
reconnaissance ships go into orbit 
around Sun-Planet, and perhaps 
three days before the main cruisers 
arrive. That gives us very little 
time. Fromm, put a tight-band sig- 
nal into the coder and send it to the 
Station, Mister Berker’s eyes only. 
I want the evacuation of Home 
Field expedited, and I want the big 
ships away from Sun-Planet in six- 
teen hours. That’ll mean doubling 
up on the shuttles, but it can be 
done within reasonable safety mar- 
gins.” Fromm went below to han- 
dle the transmission. 

“As for the rest of us,” Green 
said, “there’s more work to do. 
M-Maday, advise our setties that 
we’re going into Wormways. I want 
them to stay within hailing distance. 
Korliss, brief me on the sounder 
and analyzer. Neps, will you take 
the con?” 

“Yes, sir.” They went below 
and sealed the hatch. Korliss moved 
out of the bubble and sat across 
from Green, helping him fix himself 
in his chair. Her face was grim, but 

44 



her hands — almost grudgingly, he 
thought — were gentle and soft. 

“This is Berker,” the transceiver 
sputtered. “Final message from 
Myriadne indicates no action will be 
taken to prevent Perfidisians from 
occupying Sun-Planet. Your mes- 
sage received and acknowledged. 
Good luck.” The tuberider sub- 
merged, slow, tiny bubbles moving 
past the ports. 

“The ball is in your court, 
Commander,” Maday said. 

“Our court,” Green countered. 
“We have perhaps six hours to find 
out what the Osko Sea setties are 
hiding from us, and whether it has 
any bearing on what our setties al- 
ready know.” 

“What are the odds?” Korliss 
asked. 

“For what?” 

“Genocide.” 

Green winced, then muttered 
something unintelligible. 

“I would like to know, also, 
Commander,” Maday said. 

“At the moment,” Green replied 
grimly, “about ninety per-cent.” 

“If I thought it would do any 
good — if I didn’t know Berker 
would carry out your orders 
anyway — I’d kill you right now,” 
Maday said, “or scuttle this vessel. 
That’s my feeling, Green.” 

“If I thought it would d-do any 
good, I’d let you.” 

“Wormways, fifteen kilometers 
ahead on present course,” Neps 
said quietly. 

“Did Mr. Krutch (ell the 

GALAXY 




Execustaff what he expected us to 
find?” Maday asked. 

“No.” 

“What do you expect?” 

“I’m not the expert,” Green re- 
plied. “Perhaps dfcthing at all. This 
is a last-ditch effort.” 

“It would all be rather silly, you 
know, if the solution were some- 
thing trivial,” Fromm said. “An in- 
tergalactic shopping list.” Green 
turned in his seat to watch the bub- 
bles gliding by his port. The mem- 
ory which had gnawed at him for a 
day surfaced sharp and distinct, and 
he remembered where he’d been the 
last time he’d felt so isolated and 
unimportant. 

Six years ago, he had stood on 
the bridge of the United Stars 
Warper Ship Changeling , a quarter 
of a million kilometers above a 
thick haze of dust and stones cir- 
cling a foggy red star. He had 
watched boulders several kilometers 
wide colliding with each other, 
striking bright sparks in the haze 
every few seconds, throughout the 
thirty flat rings which would be 
planets in an eon or so. He had 
come then to understand something 
about time scales and human lives. 
Some of the larger chunks — already 
several thousand kilometers wide, 
but by no means permanent — 
floated in broad gaps between the 
ring, wrapped in thick fogs of hy- 
drogen, ammonia and methane. Sur- 
veys indicated that in the few mil- 
lion years these chunks had existed, 
lifeforms of a sort had already es- 



tablished beach-heads in the infant 
solar system. There was no way of 
knowing how many such beach- 
heads would arise, and be destroyed 
as new equilibria were established 
in the rings. Against such forces, 
even the most advanced living 
things were nothing. 

He tried to remind himself he 
didn’t believe that. How many 
times had students, in and out of 
Combine and Consolidation schools, 
been warned by their teachers about 
the paralyzing effects of awe? 
Whole philosophies of cosmic en- 
nui , of “The stars are so great and 
man is so small,” had risen and 
died and been resurrected to taunt 
people and add to the general mis- 
ery of being alive, powerless, and 
ignorant. 

But Green was not powerless, not 
by any human scale of things — and 
he was not directly concerned with 
vast forces. The decisions he would 
make would unleash not the blun- 
dering, chaotic grind of a birthing 
solar system, but a mere few watts 
of energy — the growth of pulmo- 
nary chancre virus in host tissue. 
The missiles were simple vectors, 
not very powerful in themselves — 
not even essential. He could reach 
into the warheads and scatter the 
crystals across the Ganset Sea by 
hand, and in a few weeks all the 
setties would be dead. No, the mis- 
siles were simple increasers of effi- 
ciency, savers of time. Their 
launching would not be the result of 
millions of years of natural forces, 



SUN-PLANET 



45 




but of a few decades of organic 
interaction — social scuffles, 

bureaucratic decisions, various 
small fears and conglomerate dis- 
trusts, all measurable in the smallest 
units of power. 

He was wrestling with scattered 
thoughts, and the thoughts were like 
tiny virus crystals, capable of in- 
itiating snowball reactions, made ef- 
ficient by such vectors as the bodies 
they moved, the sound and energy 
waves they communicated 
across ... all of them, all of the 
energies he was dealing with, all 
the myriad sparks in myriad brains, 
human and Perfidisian and settie, 
measurable in brief and ridiculously 
weak figures, magnified by the vec- 
tors which made them very slightly 
more efficent. 

There was no comparison be- 
tween the tiny, tight-packed ener- 
gies of thought and the patient 
accretion of natural power, and 
never would be. Living things 
would always be outranked. Then 
why was he reminded of his little- 
ness? Out of some masochistic urge 
to rub wounds? 

No. It was much simpler. Green 
himself, within the scale of living 
things, was completely powerless. 
Green the Commander could de- 
stroy the setties, and finally the en- 
tire ecosystem of Sun-Planet, which 
was delicately balanced on a tripod 
any leg of which was essential. But 
personally, inside, the ur-Green, 
child-Green, living and believing 
and non-Military Green, was a 



wandering chip of rock about to be 
ground out. He would make “his” 
decision and then drop away into 
scattered ash, the detritus of self- 
disgust and quiet. 

There was no respect, no pride in 
the kind of power which could de- 
stroy him, used or unused, with 
either guilt or the end of his entire 
career. He suddenly realized why 
the haze of planetoids came back to 
him. As a child, he had stuttered, 
then been cured, and for thirty years 
he had talked as clearly and as- 
suredly as anyone else. But four 
days after leaving the birthing solar 
system, he had started stuttering 
again. He had been so mortified at 
the outbreak — like an attack of acne 
in an old man — that he’d resolved 
to solve the problem without aid. 
Now he had some insight, but no 
resolution. He wrapped his arms 

He wrapped his arms around 
himself as if to ward off cold, and 
sank his chin into his chest. He had 
a spastic tick in his foot now. And 
there had been tiny chains of spots 
in his vision for the last two or 
three hours, not caused by 
fatigue — he’d have been long famil- 
iar with them by now if that were 
true — but by something else. 
Perhaps it was gravitation-related. 
Sun-Planet, heavy and dark, de- 
manded something superhuman 
from him, and neither his physique 
nor his mind was ready to stand up 
to the challenge. 

The tick worsened. He clenched 
his leg muscles to stop the shaking.

GALAXY 




“Wormways ahead,” Neps said. 

Green welcomed the chance to 
move about. He unhitched himself 
and walked forward. The tuberider’s 
lights switched on and Neps di- 
rected them across the sea bottom 
ten meters below the vessel. 
Chasms and holes mottled the level 
terrain, smaller than the tubes in 
Water but otherwise similar. A band 
of bright red surrounded the lip of 
each hole, the same polyps which 
provided nutrients for the jelly-bean 
plankton. Neps stopped the 
tuberider above a particularly wide 
hole and shined the underside lamps 
directly into it. Ports along the bot- 
tom showed the walls of the tunnel 
were pocked. Just around a bend, 
silver flashes coruscated. 

“There’s a skipperjack down 
there,” Korliss said. 

“Sonar indicates the water is 
thick with them,” Neps said. “I 
suppose it’s a sanctuary. Setties 
don’t come around to bother them.” 

“Can we send a lateral sounder 
into this hole? We should chart the 
pock configurations.” 

“Will do,” Fromm said. He 
squeezed past Green to pull up a 
piece of deck plating midships. A 
small cylinder with fins, like an old 
bomb, was lodged in a padded 
corner of the small compartment. 
Fromm hooked a cable onto it and 
slipped it through an equipment air- 
lock. It dropped a few meters below 
the tuberider. Neps maneuvered 
with one eye on the sonar display 
and deftly slipped the sounder into 



the hole. The sounder, equipped 
with a small motor and self- 
guidance equipment, took itself 
deeper, chasing the skipperjack a 
hundred meters before the cable ran 
out. Fromm reeled it back in. 

“We’ll need taste analysis of the 
material making up the sea bot- 
tom,” Green said. 

“Already doing that, Comman- 
der,” Neps said. “We’ve been 
making taste recordings since enter- 
ing the tabu zone. I used the boun- 
dary signals to trigger the instru- 
ments.” 

“It’ll be useless trying to record 
even a fair sample of these holes,” 
Green said. “B-but if I’m any 
judge, our setties are missing out on 
a great deal here. This place may be 
as extensive as Water.” 

Neps drew a sharp breath and 
Green looked up. A ribbon of color 
like a spectrum chart signified a 
large shoal of skipperjacks, he 
couldn’t tell how far ahead. It 
reached across the bubble’s field of 
vision. 

“Skipperjacks don’t herd,” 
Maday said pointlessly. 

“They d-do here,” Green said, 
glad to . see her discomfitted. 

“They’re big ones,” Neps said. 
“Sonar indicates they may be as 
much as fifty meters long. These 
holes are probably filled with them. 
If this is a nesting site, we’re in 
trouble.” 

“Commander, I suggest we back 
out beyond the boundary,” Korliss 
said. 



SUN-PLANET

“They’re approaching in forma- 
tion,” Neps said. 

“Reverse us,” Green ordered. 
“And bring us to the surface. I 
want to contact the Station.” 

The tuberider skimmed over the 
field without turning around, revers- 
ing its turbine flow. The band of 
colors ahead rippled and silvered 
like an aurora in a compacted sky. 

“We’re through the boundary,” 
Neps said. “Skipperjacks are scat- 
tering.” 

The tuberider surfaced and a 
static-cluttered beep immediately 
took Fromm’s attention. He ad- 
justed the filters but the static re- 
mained. “Sounds like a signal’s 
being jammed,” he said. “That’s 
an instrument control tone — what’s 
it doing on communications fre- 
quencies?” 

Green reached around Fromm’s 
arm and adjusted the receiver him- 
self. He could make out the tone- 
code now. “It’s a signal for Kerith 
Post,” he said. “But it’s being 
jammed so strongly the Post won’t 
accept it. Where’s it coming 
from?” 

“Too much bounce to tell for 
sure, but it’s too strong to be from 
anyplace but the Station.” 

“Let’s try Home Field public 
network.” 

Fromm switched bands on the 
radio and listened intently. “Noth- 
ing transmitting there.” 

“This is a prime wake period,” 
Maday said. “They have to trans- 
mit. It’s required by law.” 



“They’re not,” Fromm said tes- 
tily. 

“Put me on the Clear fre- 
quency,” Green said. Fromm 
handed him a microphone and he 
clipped it to his uniform collar. 
“This is Commander Kenneth 
Green, direct message to William 
Berker at Main Station.” 

“This channel’s jammed, too,” 
Fromm said. He switched on the re- 
ceiver speaker and pulsing white 
noise alternated with snaps and 
crackles. “It isn’t natural.” 

“The Perfidisians?” Korliss 
asked. 

“I doubt it,” Green said. “It 
would take too m-much power from 
their distance, and serve no pur- 
pose. Something’s going on at the 
Station.” 

Fromm switched on a battery of 
decoding filters and attached the 
tuberider computer to enhance the 
signal. The noise was refined into a 
garble of voices, which after some 
adjustment became comprehensible. 

“We’re receiving your signal, 
Commander Green. Main Station is 
under seige and Home Field is 
jamming on all frequencies — ” 

The signal dropped below all sav- 
ing and Green cursed the man for 
not identifying himself. “Let’s 
complete our message. Clear fre- 
quency again. This is Commander 
Green, requesting whoever receives 
this message to relay it to William 
Berker immediately. Osko Sea set- 
ties are adamant, and there appears 
to be no alternative.”

GALAXY 




Maday sighed raggedly. Green 
saw her fists were clenched. Sooner 
bash one of her children against a 
wall, he thought. Or, in effect, all 
her children — all of Sun-Planet. 
Two centuries of work. 

“We’ve got to let our setties 
examine the recordings of the tabu 
zones,” Korliss said, her voice 
high-pitched and childish. 

Fromm growled deep in his 
throat. 

“Launch vectors through 
cables — ” Green began. 

“No!” the boy shouted. He 
slammed his hand against the 
transmitter button and the micro- 
phone went dead. The noise from 
the receiver stopped and a tiny 
feedback whine dropped into si- 
lence. Then the tuberider was quiet, 
engines dead, drifting in the jerky 
wallow of the Osko Sea. “You 
won’t give that order,” Fromm 
said, much more than an adolescent 
now. “We’re going back to the Sta- 
tion to see what’s happened, but 
this radio will not be used while 
I’m controlling it.” 

Green smiled faintly and returned 
to his seat, hitching himself in. 
“Not that it will make much differ- 
ence, Mister Fromm. The instru- 
ment control tone was intended for 
Kerith Post, and the jamming is a 
deliberate attempt to block it. Mr. 
Berker has no alternative but the 
cables between the Station and 
Kerith Post’s computers.” 

“Somebody’s decided to stay and 
fight,” Maday said. “Thank God 



for brave and scrupulous men.” 

“Pray God that Sun-Planet is a 
trivial place,” Green said. “Pray 
God, Maday. Your f-friends may 
have lit more candles than they can 
ever put out.” The tender glared at 
him and turned away. Tears were 
running down Korliss’s cheeks, re- 
flecting greenish stars from the con- 
trols. 

Green felt a wild surge inside, 
almost an exultation. He laid his 
head back against the neck brace of 
his MAS and fought down a lump 
in his throat. He couldn’t decide if 
he was angry, or afraid, or simply 
relieved. Relieved of his duty. No 
responsibility now. Everything was 
shot to hell, whether or not Berker 
was able to launch the vector mis- 
siles. Behind closed eyes he saw the 
relentless grind of billions of 
planetoids. 

Then his anger surfaced and he 
opened his eyes wide, looking into 
the dim sea beyond the bubble. His 
jaws clenched. If Sun-Planet was so 
important, why not destroy it com- 
pletely? Why not provide means of 
fusing it into scattered dust and gas? 
A few bombs placed at antipodes 
along the rims of the key crustal 
shields would break through the 
mantle and release all the energy of 
the boundary layer, and it would be 
all over. 

But he knew the answer as soon 
as the question was clear. In tropi- 
cal countries on Earth, monkey- 
hunters had once trapped their prey 
by putting out small-necked jars 



SUN-PLANET 



49 




filled with fruit and cookies. The 
monkeys, unable to get both 
goodies and hands out of the jar, 
held on to their prizes, squealing 
and chattering, even as they faced 
down clubs and knives. Man’s bluff 
on Sun-Planet was similar. 

Ragged, smoke-stained men, 
women and children lined the walls 
of the canal leading from the Ganset 
Sea to the Main Station. Each wore 
an MAS, or carried the remains of a 
damaged one. Maday stood on the 
deck to prevent their firing on the 
tuberider. Green watched from the 
hatch, fighting back his own tears 
now. The Station had been as- 
saulted with what looked like chem- 
ical explosives. The protection 
screens — added two centuries before 
to offer minimal security against a 
major crust upheaval — had absorbed 
most of the shelling, but the canal 
was littered with floating debris 
and — his stomach churned — bodies. 
Astry uniforms and Home Field in- 
signia were about evenly matched in 
the slick, stained water. 

Almost as one, the crowds on the 
banks looked up at a bright flash 
passing overhead. It was the last 
colonizer, activating fusion pulses 
to take it away from Sun-Planet. 
Over ninety per-cent of Home 
Field’s citizens were aboard the 
ships. Those left behind had stayed 
by choice, to protect their work 
and, Green guessed, those they con- 
sidered their friends. 

The siege had ended barely an 
hour before. Six teams of aircraft 

50 



had dropped crust repair material, 
surplussed from Loytnant Keefer’s 
unnecessary wall, across the Kerith 
Post, burying the site in three met- 
ers of tough, quick-setting polymer 
cement. Berker had not launched 
the missiles in time. 

The lock seals swung wide and 
the tuberider entered. Docking 
clamps lifted it from the water and 
Green stepped down to confront 
Margul, who looked very grim. 

“Where’s Berker, Mister Mar- 
gul?’’ Green asked. 

“In the hospital, sir.’’ 

“Hurt in the siege?’’ 

“No, sir. I hit him.’’ 

Green could almost reconstruct 
the scene. “He was going for the 
cable system, wasn’t he?’’ The ca- 
bles were buried in the crust, and 
would have been unjammable. The 
missiles would have been launched, 
and Green’s orders from the 
Execustaff would have been carried 
out. 

“Yes,’’ Margul answered. 

“How long have you been 
of . this persuasion, M-Mister 
Margul?’’ Green asked. 

“Not long, sir.” 

“Who persuaded you?” 

Margul allowed a brief flash of 
disgust to appear on his face. “I 
persuaded myself, Commander. I 
am my own man. It would have 
been useless to kill the setties. 
Zero-Nose managed to get into the 
locks before the tenders and Home 
Fielders set up their siege. Berker 
wouldn’t listen to him.” 



GALAXY 




“What did Zero-Nose say?” 
Maday asked, carrying the rec- 
ordings from the tuberider. 

“A congress of patris put to- 
gether the final pieces of the puzzle 
after you left,” Margul said. “They 
didn’t tell us until eight hours ago, 
after the jamming began. Zero-Nose 
left the locks just before you re- 
turned. He had to get back to Wa- 
ter. The setties are fighting off 
a . fifth column, I guess you’d 
call it.” 

“Whose fifth column?” 

“The Perfidisian’s. We’ve all 
been blind, Commander. No excuse 
for it. Blind and cruel.” 

Margul was near exhaustion and 
nervous collapse. Green looked the 
man over quickly, decided he was 
babbling, and walked past him. 
Pink was standing at his post out- 
side the lock exit, and he saluted as 
Green went past. 

Green turned to the JG and asked 
how many had been killed. 

“Twelve, sir. Three are in med 
center for reconstruction. They’ll 
live with minimal handicaps. One 
will live but he’s got pretty bad 
brain damage. He’ll need extensive 
tissue regeneration and re- 
programming. His personality has 
probably been wiped, which means 
he might as well be dead.” 

“And you?” 

“The arm, sir. Command fell 
apart during the siege.” 

“How did Margul attack Ber- 
ker?” 

“With a piece of table leg, sir.” 




SUN-PLANET

Green took the lift to the fifth 
floor and looked at the bands of 
technicians wandering from console 
to console, trying to piece together 
what was left. A shell had come 
through the roof, where the shield 
was weakest, and knocked out 
communications. The detection 
center was still operative, and a 
young woman was at the position, 
eyes tracking the displays. Green 
walked behind her and put a hand 
on her shoulder. She shrugged it off 
without looking. 

“What are the Perfidisians up 
to?” he asked. 

She flinched. “Uh . I’m 
sorry, Commander. Scout ships are 
in orbit and cruisers are four hours 
away. One ship has landed near the 
Osko Sea, on — ” 

“Crooked Shield," Green said. 

“Yes, sir. You were told." 

“No," Green said. “Tabu area." 
Margul’s words suddenly made 
sense. “Safe for the fifth column." 

There was little he could do. He 
made a stab at setting up coherent 
watch schedules and gave a few 
necessary commands to allow the 
staff to repair equipment and restore 
Station function wherever they felt 
it was needed. 

He then went to his cabin, first 
pausing in the visitor’s observation 
hall. “Lights out," he said. On the 
horizon, just above the roiling 
clouds, three bright stars had joined 
the muddy constellations. They 
were of little concern to him now. 

The Station hadn’t been equipped 



to defend itself against a few 
thousand crudely armed Home 
Fielders. They didn’t have a hope 
of fighting off Perfidisians. 

VI 

The meeting room was as barren 
and unpleasant as ever. 

The Station had shut down all 
machinery not necessary for the 
immediate survival of its inhabit- 
ants, including counter- gravitation. 
Green sat alone at the head of the 
table, feeling the oppressive weight 
and silence. The jade-green walls 
completed the uneasy effect. Maday 
came in, wearing an MAS and 
clutching a file folder filled with 
papers. Korliss followed her, then 
Margul, still wan after his nervous 
breakdown of two days before. Two 
Home Field Reps came in last. 
Green pointedly ignored the fact 
that they had led the attack on the 
Station. The guard sealed the door. 

“Do you have the settie results?" 
Green asked. Maday nodded. How 
stiff and formal this room made 
people, he thought; this room, and 
the past few days. Green felt a mild 
curiosity about what the woman car- 
ried in the folder. Mighty secrets to 
oppress him further with the knowl- 
edge of his failure? Or trivialities 
which would make them break into 
laughter, if they were at all sane? 

“I-is it an interstellar shopping 
list?" he asked. 

Maday shook her head. “No. But 
for the moment it’s as useless." 



52 



GALAXY 




Korliss was the onlv one who felt 
any sympathy for him, Green 
thought. Her look, gentler and less 
bitter, gave him some strength. He 
gathered the courage to speak in 
more than brief sentences, deciding 
the stutter was unavoidable. 

“Mr. Margul, you’ve b-been here 
l-longer than I, and you've com- 
manded this St-station. Do you find 
the results credible?” 

Margul nodded. 

“Then I’d l-like to read them.” 
Maday slid the folder across the 
table and he untied the string. 
“Give me ten or fifteen minutes,” 
he said. So little time for two cen- 
turies of work. The paper’s opening 
precis supplied all he needed for 
this conference. In part, it read: 
“Worm ways and Crooked Shield 
were not essential to this final 
statement of Sun- Planet’s purpose. 
The recordings brought back by the 
Green-Maday expedition confirm 
that the tabu zones contain a sub- 
stantial portion of Sun-Planet’s in- 
tact information. But it is not neces- 
sary to have all the information in 
order to understand what Sun-Planet 
was, any more than being able to 
read a directory requires knowing 
every name on the list. 

“Sun-Planet was once occupied 
by three species of intelligent be- 
ings. The Darks themselves were 
the builders and space-farers. The 
tube-borers possessed limited in- 
telligence, and carried out strictly 
proscribed tasks. The third species 
was aquatic.” 



Thus far, Green thought, the 
Osko Sea setties had not been too 
wrong. 

“The borers absorbed information 
and carried it in their very efficient 
memories throughout the complex 
known as Water. The pocks on the 
walls of their tubes served several 
purposes, the most important being 
guidance of borers too intent on 
memorized data to watch where 
they were going. 

“The aquatic animals acted as 
‘runners.’ The Darks stored a sub- 
stantial part of the information in 
the organic shields. Minute particles 
dissolved by the sea-water acted as 
language, activating appropriate re- 
sponses in the nervous systems of 
these runners. Thus, every few cen- 
timeters of intact crust carries mil- 
lions of bits of data, molecularly 
encoded. The aquatic animals re- 
trieved the data, carried it to the 
borers, and they in turn delivered it 
to whomever requested the selec- 
tion. 

“There is no way of knowing 
what the relation between the Darks 
and their servants was, genetically 
or socially. The Darks may have 
engaged in genetic engineering on 
Sun-Planet much like its current oc- 
cupants . 

“It is now certain that none of 
the beings involved were mam- 
malian. The aquatic animals bore no 
resemblance to setties. In fact, they 
resembled cephalopods.” 

Green shook his head slowly. In 
two hundred years, driven by the 



SUN-PLANET 



53 




destruction of their kind — not devas- 
tating, but terrifyingly certain — the 
skipperjacks had evolved their own 
cultures and discovered for them- 
selves that the organic shields could 
be “read." Differences in their ner- 
vous structure and biochemistry 
made their readings incomplete, yet 
the storage system was still less 
alien to them than it was to the set- 
ties. Nevertheless, the information 
had never meant a great deal to 
them until the arrival of the Perfidi- 
sians. 

And then the fifth column had 
been established. While the setties 
labored, the skipperjacks gathered. 
They found their equivalent of 
Water in the tabu zones, and made 
a stand, relying — the precis 

confirmed — on the setties’ natural 
aversion to conditions there. 

He held his head to still a begin- 
ning headache. The skipperjacks 
weren’t intelligent in the same way 
humans and setties were. They were 
not independently creative or capa- 
ble of the cultural complexities hu- 
mans and setties took for granted. 
Yet it was now apparent the Darks’ 
aquatic ‘runners’ had been no more 
complete than the skipperjacks. 

“There is no way of knowing 
what the rest of Sun-Planet’s 
ecosystem was like. Fossils are un- 
known. The borers and sea- 
creatures were mostly soft tissue, 
leaving nothing behind which can 
be found with the resources at our 
disposal. 

“The molecules of the organic 



shields, and the sundry other codes 
of Sun-Planet, describe every world 
the Darks visited or established col- 
onies on. Everything except infor- 
mation about the Darks and their ac- 
tivities has been included.’’ 

The last paragraph was surpris- 
ingly terse. Green flipped through 
to the matching section in the report 
and found that it, too, was small 
compared to the rest of the material. 
Evidently the setties valued least 
what the humans wanted most of 
all. 

As Maday had said, for the mo- 
ment it was all useless. Neither the 
Perfidisians nor the humans had the 
resources to visit every planet listed 
in the apparently huge file. Prelimi- 
nary translation pointed to a total of 
well over seventy billion worlds in 
the catalog, scattered throughout the 
galaxy, the Magellanic clouds, and 
near clusters of stars. 

“This will be very important 
someday,’’ he said. 

“Too late to make up excuses,’’ 
Maday countered. “For the present 
it’s just so much drivel. Most of the 
relative measures and directions 
must be dated by hundreds of 
thousands, even millions of years. 
That makes most of the information 
useless.’’ 

“Nothing is irretrievable, given 
time,” Green said. “If we even 
have a tenth — a c-conservative 
guess — of the t-total, in time it 
w-will be possible to track down a 
1-large number of the listed 
w-worlds. And the technology of 



54 



GALAXY 




beings who could build a world like 
Sun-Planet — that would b-be very 
useful indeed. Any artifacts 
w- would be revolutionary.” 

“And for that remote possibility, 
you would — ” Maday began. 

“That’s enough,” Green said. 
“What’s happened here in the past 
few days does honor to n-no one, 
and sh-should make n-none o-of 
u-us proud, sh-sh-should n- 
n-not — ” He stopped and whistled 
to break the impasse. Maday didn’t 
diminish the intensity of her glare. 
Green hated her for one indulgent 
moment. She was like a machine. 
She knew only one thing — devotion 
to setties — and did not care much 
about her own kind, or why they 
were compelled to do certain things. 
But he couldn’t condemn her folly, 
not with his own dichotomy still be- 
fore him. The weight and unease 
crept around him again. “Is there 
anything else?” 

“Yes,” Korliss said. “Forgive 
me, but I haven’t grasped what this 
is all about. Using a ... a thing 
like Sun-Planet to hold information 
seems the height of absurdity. It’s 
huge, and must be inefficient com- 
pared to other ways the Darks had. 
Why did they build it in the first 
place?” 

Green thought that over for a few 
moments. No one else answered. 
They were all provincial — their 
major experience had been on one 
world. None of them had seen the 
peculiarities the most intelligent 
species were capable of. But then, 



that qualification didn’t seem ap- 
propriate here. 

“It d-didn’t need much upkeep,” 
he said. “Once established, it sus- 
tained itself for long periods of 
time. As an information storage sys- 
tem, it’s still a bit m-more efficient 
than our b-best material memory un- 
its. Consider the v-volume of in- 
formation. And putting all of that in 
spacial or quantum storage would 
take too much energy. Sun-Planet 
w-would have been ideal if the 
Darks weren’t in much of a hurry to 
retrieve data. It would probably 
have t-taken several days for a re- 
quest to be carried out.” 

“Seventy billion worlds,” Mar- 
gul said. He looked up from the ta- 
ble, embarrassed at musing out 
loud. 

“Exactly,” Green said. “Allow a 
trillion words or more for each 
world’s description . .It’s stagger- 
ing.” He looked around for more 
questions and saw none. “I th-thank 
you all for coming. Tomorrow — s- 
standard — we’ll try to arrange a 
meeting with the Perfidisians. I’ll 
be th-the one to meet them. Until then, 
there will be no effort to communicate 
with them.” 

“I doubt you have the power to 
enforce such an order,” Maday 
said. “Any military command on 
Sun-Planet was revoked by the ac- 
tion of the civilians.” 

“There are going to be a lot 
m-more difficulties before w-we can 
sit b-back and be smug,” Green 
said quietly. 



SUN-PLANET

“The Commander knows more 
about Perfidisians than any of us,” 
Korliss said. “I think his suggestion 
is only common sense.” 

Maday leaned back in her chair. 

VII 

Sun-Planet’s morning came. 
There was little difficulty arranging 
a meeting. In the repaired com- 
munications center, the Perfidisian’s 
voice — if only one was speaking — 
sounded completely human. There 
was no hint of personality or any 
underlying character in the word- 
choice of the reply. They would 
send their representative to meet 
Green on a specified beach, not 
more than ten kilometers from the 
Station, bordering the Ganset Sea. 

Green went alone, and took a 
tracked vehicle to the beach, wear- 
ing his MAS and a small recorder. 
A hundred meters from the 
specified point, the vehicle stopped 
and the recorder refused to function. 
The MAS continued to operate, and 
he was able to finish the journey 
with little strain. For a few minutes 
after his arrival the beach was 
empty. 

Then the squat disk materialized, 
its weight sending pressure-waves 
across the water-soaked sand. On 
the disk, a metal sculpture began to 
spin itself, fluid and magical. Green 
was unimpressed. He’d seen this 
kind of display before, the last time 
he’d met with a Perfidisian “repre- 
sentative.” What the trick meant to 



them, he didn’t know, but its charm 
was lost on second viewing. 

In a few seconds, three spheres 
rested on top of each other on the 
plate. The topmost sphere opened 
into a dark circular hole, from which 
a voice seemed to come. 

“I assume we both know by now' 
what Sun-Planet is,” the voice said. 

“Enough to get the picture,’’ 
Green said, purposefully using the 
idiom. The Perfidisians weren’t 
all-knowing. There was a pause be- 
fore the next few words came. 

“This reclamation will cover one 
terrestrial year. In that time, we will 
allow one of your large ships to 
pick up all remaining inhabitants — 
humans only, of course — and take 
them home.” 

“This is their home,’’ Green 
said. Again the surge and elation 
rose in him. He swallowed and 
said, “Most were bom here. Most 
are Abstainers.” Would the Perfidi- 
sians know what Abstainers were? 
There was no pause. 

“It is of no importance to us how 
many stay. We cannot guarantee 
their safety.” 

“We will all stay,” Green said. 
“We have obligations to our chil- 
dren.” He’d thought the word out 
carefully hours before — and it was 
far preferrable to “creations,” or 
“animals,” or anything else which 
came to mind. 

“We are not in competition,” the 
voice said. “Do you understand 
that?” 

“We do not compete directly,” 



56 



GALAXY 




Green said. “But we do compete. 
All living things must.” 

“Strange but appropriate senti- 
ment,” the voice said. “Two cen- 
turies ago, you put life on this 
world which could survive only 
through death and destruction. Had 
you been wiser, and seen the 
cruelty imposed on all of us by na- 
ture, you might have thought to 
create something truly original, and 
not merely an imitation of our un- 
certain origins. As it was, you ben- 
efited us as much as yourself, and 
by fluke. We seldom benefit from 
such flukes. It gives us the impres- 
sion, whatever your other charac- 
teristics, that you are not truly com- 
petetive, not like the Aighors, for 
example.” 

That was the longest speech he 
had ever heard from a Perfidisian. It 
almost made him doubt he was 
dealing with one. Perhaps a com- 
puter personality had been estab- 
lished to talk with humans. There 
was no way of knowing. 

“You will take no action against 
us, and we will not interfere with 
you,” Green said. “And if s-such 
an opportunity c-comes, p-perhaps 
we w-will,” the words came hard, 
“exchange what we know.” 

The sphere said nothing for a 
long moment. “Your defective 
speech can be corrected. We can 
correct it for you, without inconven- 
ience or any harm or interference.” 

“No thank you,” Green said. He 
had no reason to doubt theii 
honesty — it was a trivial matter, and

rather like them to offer such sense- 
less concessions. 

“We will go in a year,” the 
sphere said. “At that time, the 
skipperjacks will be released from 
any undue self-awareness this world 
has imposed on them. What you do 
after will be your own business. 
There will be very few opportunities 
for us to talk again. Choose them 
with care.” 

“Understood,” Green said. 

The figure dissolved and the sand 
flowed back. Nothing physically 
measurable remained. 

And now, his memory of the 
words was unclear, though the 
sense remained undistorted. 

It would be an uneasy time. He 
had thought his job was over, and 
his command at an end. But for a 
year, they would be on their own, 
and that would require a huge 
amount of discipline, which he could 
help provide. 

His superiors had bollixed things 
from beginning to end, and he had 
been forced, by training and past 
inclination, to go along with them. 
That burden was now tossed aside. 
He was his own man. He reached 
for the insignia on his uniform, and 
formed a fist around them, then re- 
laxed. 

Not even the symbolic untying of 
knots was necessary. Never again, 
no matter what the consequences, 
would he ever be a tool of someone 
else’s will. That was his dichotomy. 

Only when a planetoid was able 
to rise out of the haze, and achieve 

58 



sufficient eminence to avoid the col- 
lisions of its neighbors, was there 
hope for life, and growth, and inde- 
pendence. 

In the haze, there was only con- 
fusing and grinding. 

When he returned to the Station, 
he briefed four reps and three of his 
senior officers. He told them their 
connection with the Astry was tem- 
porarily severed by circumstance, 
and that they were for the moment 
dependent only on their own 
judgement. 

“I will r-remain your Comman- 
der,” he said, “only so long as I 
demonstrate an understanding of 
Sun-Planet, and all it represents. I 
expect to be reminded i-if I step 
away from that path.” 

Korliss met him at the door to the 
locks after the meeting and offered 
to introduce him to Zero-Nose and 
F-Spot. 

“We’ve met, I believe,” Green 
said, smiling. 

“I’m not so sure you have,” 
Korliss countered. “Besides, if 
you’re going to be a leader for the 
next few months — ” 

“A big if, depending on people 
like yourself and Maday.” 

“ — if you are, we have to get rid 
of that stammer. Believe me, I 
know what it can be like in tough 
moments. The setties helped me — 
perhaps they can help you.” 
“Perhaps,” Green said. 

But he knew the problem was al- 
ready a long way toward being 
solved. ★

Freya had always wanted 
a special kind of friend. 



Sitting in her window one 
night, dreaming of having a friend, 
Freya was the first to see the 
stranger as he came out of the black 
nowhere of the west Texas night, 
walking as if he were moving 
through water or dragging great 
weights on his legs. She wasn’t sure 
she really saw this shambling appa- 
rition moving across the grass until 
the dogs began to howl and cry. 

Downstairs, Frank Hudspeth sat 
reading accounts of strange appari- 
tions and extra-terrestrial visitors in 
a circle of light in the big, dark liv- 
ing room. The sound of the 
dogs — he had never heard them 
make a noise quite like that — made 
the back of his neck prickle. 

“What’s wrong with the dogs, 
Frank?” Edwina stood in the door- 
way, almost on tiptoe — a trick she 
had when she was nervous. 

Frank bent over and fished his 
soft, worn shoes out from under the 
footstool. “I’ll go out and see,” he 
said. “It’s probably just a coyote.” 

“Do you think you should take a 
gun?” 

Frank owned several guns — left 
to him, along with the house and 
ranch, by his father, but he had 
never felt comfortable with them. 

“Aw, no, honey,” he said, 
standing and sucking in his 
stomach. He looked at his wife ten- 
derly. “I’ll put the yardlights on the 
stand on the porch till I see what it 
is. Those dogs are crazy, anyway.” 

Frank flipped the switch to flood 
the yard with light and stepped out 



on the porch yelling, “Dogs! Y’all 
quiet down!” 

He gazed out uncertainly at the 
man weaving across the lawn. A 
drunk from the highway? But why 
were the dogs making such a fuss? 

“Mister?” Frank called uncer- 
tainly. The dogs finally quieted. 
The stranger continued to lurch and 
amble forward. Then, abruptly, the 
stranger pitched forward and lay 
face down on the ground. 

Freya moved away from the win- 
dow when she saw her father run 
out across the lawn to the fallen 
stranger. Her fists were clenched, 
the nails pressing tiny-moons in her 
palms.

“Well, I can’t find a thing wrong 
with him,” Dr. Kaye said, sighing 
and pushing out his lower lip. 
“He’ll sleep it off, I suppose.” 

“But, doctor — there must be 
something wrong with him,” Ed- 
wina said, a small, reasonable smile 
on her face. “After all, he is un- 
conscious.” 

Dr. Kaye looked at her without 
warmth. “Yes ma’am. He doesn’t 
smell of liquor, so I don’t think 
he’s drunk. He doesn’t seem to be 
in shock, and he doesn’t have any 
big lumps on his head. Could be he 
just passed out from exhaustion and 
exposure — from the looks of him, 
he’s travelled quite a ways, and a 
good meal would probably be a 
novelty to him. Or it could be

drugs, or it could be a combination 
of things — drugs, hunger, exhaus- 
tion. He’s probably just some 
California bum, hopped to the gills 
and driving cross country when he 
stopped the car to be sick. And then 
forgot where he left his car, so he 
had to walk. Just y ’all’s bad luck he 
picked your yard to pass out in.” 

“What makes you think he’s 
from California, Doctor?” Frank 
asked. “After all, we didn’t find 
any identification on him.” 

“California, New Mexico, Las 
Vegas.’’ The doctor shook his 
head. “Who the hell cares? He’s 
not from around here , and he’s ob- 
viously pumped full of dope ...” 

“I thought you couldn’t be sure 
of that,” Edwina said. 

The doctor shrugged irritably, as 
if a fly had landed on his ear. “Of 
course I can’t be sure of that. We’d 
need tests for that. Y’all did call the 
sheriff?” 

Frank nodded. “He should be 
here by now,” he said, wondering 
uncomfortably if the sheriff would 
come. He had sounded disbelieving 
on the phone, and Frank remem- 
bered too well an unpleasant half- 
hour in which the sheriff had ques- 
tioned him about “that crazy flying 
saucer book you wrote,” trying to 
get an admission that the book was 
all a joke or a hoax. Frank had held 
fast, and now the sheriff looked at 
him as if he were crazy on the rare 
occasions when they met. 

“The sheriff’ll know what to 
do,” Dr. Kay said. 



The dogs began to bark 
outside — their normal barking, this 
time. 

“That must be the sheriff,” Ed- 
wina said with relief. Frank looked 
at her, feeling protective. Would 
she feel that same relief if she knew 
the sheriff spoke of her in town as 
“that crazy woman”? Frank moved 
closer to his wife and put his arm 
around her. 

“I’ll be going now,” Dr. Kaye 
said. “If y’all will excuse me.” 

The sheriff was getting out of his 
car as Dr. Kaye stepped out onto 
the porch. Frank and Edwina stood 
in the open doorway, watching as 
the two men met and exchanged a 
few sentences in lowered tones. 

“Doc tells me y’all’ve got some 
doped-up hippie here,’’ Sheriff 
James said, pulling his hat off. He 
stepped inside and gazed around the 
high-ceilinged front hall. “Where’d 
you stash him?” 

“He’s upstairs, in the guest bed- 
room,’’ Edwina said. “And we 
don't know for sure that he’s been 
taking drugs. Dr. Kaye said he 
couldn’t tell for sure.” 

“Yes ma’am, I know that,” the 
sheriff said, following Edwina up 
the stairs. 

It was the sheriff’s opinion that 
the stranger was either a doped-up 
Mexican or some crazy bum from 
one of those communes in New 
Mexico. He offered to lock him up, 
pointing out that the man, who had 
no identification papers, might be 
an illegal alien.

'‘The border is nowhere near 
here,” Frank protested. 

The sheriff shrugged. ‘‘Might be 
a good idea to lock him up anyway. 
In the morning, if he can explain 
himself, I let him out of jail and he 
goes on his way.” 

“No thanks,” Frank said. “I 
don’t think we’d be doing him a 
favor to put him in jail.” 

“Might be doing you a favor, 
though,” Sheriff James said. “Y’all 
don’t intend to let this guy stay here 
overnight?” 

“For as long as he needs to 
stay,” Frank said coldly. “What- 
ever happened to hospitality?” 
“Crazy people made it danger- 
ous,” the sheriff said. 

“Thank you for your valuable 
time, Sheriff James,” Frank said. 
“We appreciate your coming out 
here, this time of night.” 

The other man shrugged and put 
his hat back on. “Y’all had better 
be careful,” he said. “Just because 
we don’t have any calls out on es- 
capees from mental institutions 
don’t mean he’s not one. He could 
have come from a long way away, 
been in hiding for awhile. I’ll see 
what I can find in the morning — I’ll 
see what word I can get out of 
Mexico, and I’ll get the latest on 
missing persons, get a photo of this 
guy with his eyes open and send it 
around.” 

“Would you like some coffee be- 
fore you go?” Edwina asked. 

“No thank you, ma’am.” He 
nodded to them both. “Give me a 

62 



call in the morning when he starts 
talking — or if he doesn’t.” 

Freya crouched beside her door, 
listening to the voices in the hall. 
When she heard them all go 
downstairs again, she crept across 
the hall into the guest bedroom, 
where she sat for a long time beside 
the stranger’s bed, watching the 
faint movements of his eyes behind 
their closed lids and wondering 
what strange sights those eyes had 
seen. She had a feeling she would 
soon find out. 

★ ★ ★ 

The stranger was conscious in the 
morning, but would not or could 
not talk. He did not respond when 
Edwina questioned him in English, 
Spanish, French and Russian. He 
gazed with dark and uncomprehend- 
ing eyes while Frank attempted 
simple and complex hand signals. 
Freya, standing in the doorway and 
watching it all, began giggling 
helplessly at her father’s contor- 
tions. 

Edwina turned. “Are you still 
here? You’re going to miss your 
bus again if you don’t hurry.” Her 
look said plainly that Freya did not 
belong here. 

Freya backed away. It was nearly 
time for the bus, and she would 
have to run down the long, shelled 
driveway to the highway to catch it. 

“I wonder what he’s thinking,” 
Edwina said. 

“He might still be dopey,” Frank 

GALAXY 




said. “Maybe this afternoon he’ll 
be able to respond.” 

“It’s awfully funny he doesn’t 
have any identification. Not even 
labels in his clothes.” 

“They’re old clothes,” Frank 
said. “And he might have left his 
wallet in his car.” 

“If he came in a car.” 

“Or he might have been rob- 
bed,” Frank said. “Maybe he 
picked up a hitch-hiker with a gun, 
and got turned out of his own car in 
the desert.” 

“He’s a mysterious stranger,” 
Edwina said. She looked down at 
the man’s face, which looked very 
dark contrasted against the white 
pillowcase. He looked back at her, 
blank and guideless as an infant. 
“There are probably a lot more 
mysterious strangers around than 
anyone realizes. They walk out of 
nowhere, and then get explained 
away. They’re crazy, or sick, or 
from another country, or am- 
nesiac.” 

“We have to look for facts, Ed- 
wina,” Frank said. “Otherwise we 
don’t have anything better than fairy 
tales.” 

“Oh, facts,” said Edwina scorn- 
fully. “Physical evidence. That’s 
not all there is to life. What about 
feelings , Frank? Don’t you believe 
we can feel things that we can’t 
know by other means?” 

Frank looked away from her ac- 
cusing face, feeling acutely uncom- 
fortable. “I’m going to go out and 
look for his car,” he said. “He 



might have had a wreck, or run out 
of gas, a few miles from here.” 

“I don’t think he came in a car,” 
Edwina said. She looked back at the 
stranger. “But go ahead.” 

Frank spent most of the morning 
searching the warm, windy land. 
First he took his car and drove a 
full ten miles in each direction on 
the highway which ran east and 
west through the flat, open country. 
He drove slowly, examining the 
sides of the road for unexpected 
culverts which might hide a small 
car, and gazing off into the dusty, 
scrubby distances until his eyes 
ached, looking for anything. 

He found nothing. 

He put the car back in the garage 
and went on foot across his land — 
land he owned but rented out to a 
neighbor who needed more land to 
graze his cattle. Frank wondered 
that they found enough to eat on 
this inhospitable soil. He walked 
out to the tank, where the black- 
faced steers moved sullenly away at 
his approach. Frank tossed a stone 
into the still, murky water and re- 
membered swimming in it as a boy, 
during three summers spent with his 
grandfather. 

He thought about Edwina, and 
about the stranger, and wondered 
what force would take a man’s 
mind and drive him on foot across 
miles and miles of empty land. 

Frank could hear Edwina talking 
on the telephone in the study when 
he came back inside. He stood be- 
side the door, listening for a mo-

ment, then moved on, satisfied that 
the caller was another “Missing 
Hours” enthusiast. 

“The Missing Hours” was 
Frank’s first book, and Edwina’s 
story. The title referred to four 
hours which had been lost from 
Edwina’s life until, under hypnosis, 
she revealed a startling and detailed 
memory of an encounter with alien 
creatures in a spaceship. 

After the success of “The Miss- 
ing Hours” Frank had written other 
books about the UFO phenomena, 
but it was all second-hand material, 
garnered from interviews and from 
other books. They had sold well, 
but it was “The Missing Hours” 
which still drew the mail, the phone 
calls, the curious visitors. It was 
time, Frank thought, to find some- 
thing new to write about. 

Then he paused, struck: could the 
stranger upstairs be a hoax? He 
would have to be very careful, 
Frank decided. He knew what Ed- 
wina wanted to believe — what she 
already was believing — and knew 
that it would be hard to counter her 
belief with a search for the truth. 

★ ★ ★ 

Freya sat on the hard-packed dirt 
of the playground, her skill tucked 
beneath her and her back against the 
cold metal pole of the tetherball, 
waiting for her mother to come for 
her. 

Her mother, she knew, would be 
angry, and would accuse her of de- 
liberately missing the bus. Her 



mother would be right. Freya 
dreaded making her mother angry, 
but would have missed the school- 
bus everyday if she had dared. 

Freya had no friends, and riding 
the schoolbus home everyday meant 
another ordeal of being shunned or 
being teased. The other children dis- 
liked and distrusted her because she 
was different and made no effort to 
be liked. 

But how could she be friends 
with kids who made fun of her 
city-bred father for writing crazy 
books instead of raising cattle, and 
made fun of her mother because she 
had talked to monsters from outer 
space? 

Freya tensed, scowling, and drew 
her knees up to her chest, hugging 
her legs to herself. How could 
someone whose idea of a journey to 
a faraway place was a weekend trip 
to Wichita Falls make fun of her 
mother, who was probably one of 
the most important people on this 
planet? Her beautiful, intelligent, 
famous mother. 

It hurt to have no friends, and to 
be the only girl in the sixth grade 
who’d never even been asked to go 
steady, but Freya was willing to put 
up with anything, if only it truly 
mattered. If only her mother would 
notice, and care. 

Freya had been born eight months 
after Edwina Hudspeth’s “missing 
hours.” When, five years later, the 
missing hours were recalled to her, 
Edwina did not miss the signifi- 
cance in the timing of Freya’s birth.

GALAXY 




The suggestion that Edwina might 
have been impregnated during her 
sojourn with the aliens, or that the 
month-old foetus might have been 
altered somehow, was duly and tan- 
talizingly made in the book, al- 
though the Hudspeths had to admit 
that Freya seemed no different from 
any other human child. Doctors, sci- 
entists, mystics, crazies and skep- 
tics, all intrigued by the Hudspeths 
book, came to the ranch to examine 
Freya. For a little while, Freya was 
the center of a lot of attention. 

Freya was tested for anything and 
everything that happened to occur to 
anyone, but all the tests revealed 
her as a bright, but basically ordi- 
nary, little girl. Freya wanted to 
please her mother, but the hints her 
mother gave her were useless. She 
couldn’t, no matter how she tried, 
read minds, predict the future, or 
make small objects move across the 
room. She couldn’t do those things, 
and nothing else that she could be 
seemed to be special enough to 
please her mother.

“He could be an Indian,” Frank 
said again. He and Edwina watched 
the stranger who sat propped up in 
bed, watching them with bewildered 
brown eyes. 

“I don’t think there are any In- 
dians left who don’t speak Eng- 
lish,” Edwina said, “or at least 
Spanish. And even if he is from 
some isolated area down in 
Mexico — how did he get here ?” 

KIN TO KASPAR HAUSER 



Freya, who had been standing 
quietly in the doorway, now came 
forward, her eyes fixed on the man 
in the bed. He turned away from 
Frank to watch her. 

“Freya!” Edwina said sharply. 

“It’s all right, Mama,” Freya 
said. “He’s my friend.” As she 
spoke, the stranger put out a hand. 
She patted it gently. 

“Freya,” Frank said uneasily. 

“No, Frank,” Edwina said. 
“It’s all right. Freya’s right. I think 
he likes her.” 

Freya smiled. A moment later, an 
eerie echo, the stranger smiled, too. 

Later that night, when the house 
was dark and still, Freya returned to 
the guest room to speak to the 
stranger. She asked him about him- 
self, and about the world he had 
come from. She supplied the an- 
swers herself, for the stranger re- 
mained silent. She could see his 
eyes shining in the moonlight which 
filtered through gauzy curtains, and 
she knew he was awake and listen- 
ing. 

★ ★ ★ 

“What’s it like where you come 
from?” Freya asked softly. “Can 
you do magic there? You have a car 
that flies, don’t you? And you take 
it out on highways which are just 
like ribbons of light hanging in the 
air. Birds fly right through them, 
but your car follows the light- 
highway and never crashes. 

“You don’t live in a house like 
this one, either. You live in a house

with crystal walls where the colors 
change with your moods. You can 
see through them when you want 
to. And every autumn you step out- 
side and clap your hands and the 
whole house crumbles — it falls like 
flaming leaves and like snow. And 
then to build a new one you just — ” 

The door opened, and there was 
Edwina, a large drawing-pad and 
half a dozen felt-tipped pens in her 
hands, ready for another attempt at 
communication with the stranger. 

“What are you doing here?” she 
demanded. “Why aren’t you in 
school?” 

Freya moved awkwardly away 
from the bed. “It’s Saturday, 
Mama.” 

“Well, you shouldn’t be in here, 
bothering our guest.” 

“I’m not bothering him,” she 
said at once. “Alph and I were just 
talking.” 

“Don’t — did you call him 
‘Alph’?” 

Freya nodded slowly. 

“Why?” 

‘‘It’s his name.” 

“You mean you just decided to 
name him, as if he were a doll.” 
Her mother’s voice was full of 
scorn. 

“No,” Freya said, stung. “He 
told me it was his name. Alph told 
me. 

“Freya, are you telling me the 
truth?” Her mother looked so 
sternly into her face that Freya 
could not back down now. 

“Yes,” she said. 



Edwina set the drawing pad and 
pens down on the bedside table and 
leaned close to the man in the bed. 
“Alph,” she said to the deeply tan- 
ned face. 

“Alph?” 

His lips moved slightly, as if he 
would try to mimic her, and then 
his head, propped up against two fat 
pillows, nodded. 

Edwina laughed. “Alph!” 

She looked at her daughter. “Can 
he speak. Has he spoken to you?” 

Freya shrugged and moved un- 
comfortably, twining one leg around 
the other and nearly falling off bal- 
ance . 

“Stand still , Freya! What did he 
say? How did he tell you his name 
was Alph?” 

“He just told me, that’s all. I 
don’t remember what he said, 
exactly.” 

“Freya,” said her mother in a 
deceptively gentle tone, “Are you 
making this up? Are you playing a 
game?” 

Freya shook her head. “I’m not a 
baby. I’m not pretending. It’s the 
truth.” 

“All right, dear. I believe you. 
Can you get Alph to talk to me?” 

Freya looked from the man in the 
bed to her mother’s intent face. 
“I’m not sure,” she said. 

“Try, Freya. Tell him we won’t 
hurt him — you know we won’t. We 
want to help him. Ask him to trust 
us, as he’s trusted you, and talk to 
us. I think he might feel more at 
ease with me than with your father,

GALAXY 




at first, so if he could just speak to 
me . ?” 

Dutifully, Freya crouched beside 
the bed. She touched the stranger’s 
hand. She told him to trust her 
mother, to talk to her, to tell her 
about himself. She could feel her 
mother’s expectations pressing like 
a weight on her head, and if she 
could have made words come out of 
the stranger’s mouth she would 
have. She knew what her mother 
wanted to hear. But the stranger 
only looked at her and would say 
nothing. 

“I think he’s confused,” Freya 
said. “Maybe he cant talk when 
you’re in the room. I’m not sure 
what it is.” 

“But he talks to you,” Edwina 
said. “Well, you tell me what he 
says. I’ll leave you two alone 
now.” Her voice casual, Edwina 
went out, closing the door gently 
behind her. 

Freya knew her mother was wait- 
ing outside the door, her ear pressed 
close to the wood. She could almost 
hear her breathing. Freya looked at 
Alph. He said nothing. 

That night it was different. When 
the house was still at last, and she 
knew her parents were asleep, Freya 
went quietly across the hall into 
Alph’s room and then, at last, she 
knew he would talk to her. 

Wrapped in the soothing darkness 
of the room, lulled by the soft 
rhythms of her own voice, Freya 
fell into a sort of half-sleep. She 
couldn’t be certain if she were talk- 



ing or only dreaming of talking, and 
at times her voice changed in her 
ears so that she thought it came 
from another part of the room. It 
might have been herself speaking, 
or Alph, or someone else entirely. 

★ ★ ★ 

“Do Alph’s people often travel to 
Earth?” Edwina asked. 

Freya nodded. Alph sat, quietly 
as ever, in the big armchair by the 
window. Although his eyes stayed 
on Freya, it was hard to tell what 
he actually saw; impossible to say 
what he might be thinking. 

“Was he in trouble when he first 
came to us? Was he sick? Why 
couldn’t he communicate with us?” 
Edwina sat tensely, her eyes flick- 
ing from Freya to Alph. 

“He was hurt a little in his 
mind — he wasn’t used to the way 
people think here. It was such a 
jumble that he couldn’t think 
straight. He lost his way, he stum- 
bled around, like he was dizzy. It 
was like a constant loud noise that 
he couldn’t shut out. He’s learning 
to understand us a little better now, 
though.” 

“But why can he talk to you, 
Freya?” Why won’t he talk to me? 
asked her eyes. 

“I don’t know. He says my mind 
is clearer — ” 

“Because you’re so young, no 
doubt,” Edwina said. “Your mind 
isn’t all cluttered up with grown-up 
emotions, or doubts or knowledge.”

She leaned forward again and took 
Freya’s hands in hers. “What does 
it feel like when he talks to you, 
Frey a?” 

Freya shrugged. “It’s just like 
listening to anyone,” she said. 
“You. Or Daddy. Or myself.” 

Edwina looked at Alph. “I’m 
sure I could hear you if you spoke 
to me, Alph,” she said. “Won’t 
you try? I want to help you, you 
know.” 

Alph looked at Freya. Freya 
dropped her eyes. 

“Leave us alone together, 
Freya,” Edwina said. “I have some 
things to say to Alph. You go on up 
and do your homework now. What 
are you waiting for? And close the 
door behind you. I don’t want to 
be disturbed.” 

Edwina looked at the man in the 
armchair. He seemed to lose a part 
of himself when Freya went away, 
she thought. He seemed frightened, 
looking from Edwina to the door 
and back again. Confusion had 
dropped like a mist across his fea- 
tures. Edwina knew, even before 
she began to speak to him, that it 
would be useless. He would hear 
nothing she said. 

★ ★ ★ 

“You’re going to have to talk to 
her,” Freya said. Alph watched her 
as intently as always. Sometimes 
Freya thought she was the only per- 
son in the world that Alph could see 
and hear. 

68 



“You have to tell her the stories 
she wants to hear, the things we 
talk about together. You have to 
start talking to her now. If you 
don’t, she’ll send you away. She 
told me she would send you away. 

“Will you, Alph? Look,” she 
said, her voice becoming pleading, 
“Don’t you want to stay here with 
me? All you have to do is talk to 
her — you know what to say. And 
we’ll be famous if you do — we’ll 
both be famous. But otherwise, if 
you don’t talk, they won’t believe 
me anymore, and you’ll have to be 
sent away. 

“Alph, will you? Will you talk to 
her and tell her all about your 
planet and everything?” 

Alph still just looked at her, the 
way he always did, but Freya was 
sure he understood. She had a feel- 
ing, a strong feeling, that he would 
start talking now. 

★ ★ ★ 

He didn’t speak so well, he told 
Mrs. Hudspeth, because on his 
planet words were not the style. 
They talked mind to mind and heart 
to heart there, but on this world that 
didn’t work so well, and it took him 
awhile to adjust. The violence, 
sickness and ignorance of so many 
minds had come as a shock to him 
and made him sick. He was very 
grateful for the care the Hudspeths’ 
had given him, he said. And he was 
very grateful to have met Freya. 
She was a very special person. 

GALAXY 




They could speak together heart to 
heart and mind to mind, he and 
young Freya. She had a mind as 
sharp and pure as fine crystal.

“He kept going on and on about 
Freya,” Edwina said, pacing the 
floor of the study, her blue velvet 
gown swirling around her ankles, 
her long white hands clasped tightly 
before her. 

Frank sat behind the big desk, his 
face in shadow. Edwina did not 
look at him. 

“Finally I asked him if Freya’s 
specialness set her apart from the 
rest of humanity — if she might not 
be the child of some other race. I 
told him about my — encounter — and 
he didn’t seem surprised. As if he 
already knew. 

“But he said that you were defi- 
nitely Freya’s father. He said her 
difference, her specialness, might be 
accounted for by her pre-birth 
experiences — some influence ab- 
sorbed from the aliens. Or,” Ed- 
wina stopped walking. Her clasped 
hands rose to her chin. “He said 
that / might be the reason. He said 
Freya might be special because I am 
her mother, for I am a very special 
person, too.” 

Edwina fell silent at last, waiting 
for Frank to comment or to ques- 
tion. But he said nothing, and she 
began to feel uneasy. She could not 
even read his face, half in darkness 
as he was.

“Well, I suppose there’s no point 
in us talking about him now,’’ Ed- 
wina said at last, trying to pretend 
there was nothing unnatural in 
Frank’s silence. “You’ll have to 
talk to him yourself. I didn’t ask, 
but I’m sure he’ll take to you — I’m 
sure he’ll answer any questions you 
have. He’s being very coopera- 
tive.” She waved a hand at the 
books and papers stacked across the 
broad face of the desk. “That’s 
what you need — first-hand informa- 
tion, so you can really get started 
on your new book!” 

“I haven’t decided what my new 
book will be yet,” he said quietly. 

“Haven’t decided? Well, the sub- 
ject of your next book is living up- 
stairs,” Edwina said playfully. 
“Frank, what is the matter with 
you? You should be as excited as I 
am — this is the story we’ve been 
waiting for!” 

Frank sat forward with a sigh. 
The light from the desk lamp 
slashed a yellow bar across his face, 
but he kept his eyes down. “I don’t 
believe in Alph,” he said quietly. 
“1 don’t buy his story.” 

Edwina stared at him in disbelief. 
“How can you say that? If you’d 
only listen to him — ” 

“I have. I came past the room 
while he was telling you the story 
of his life. I almost came in, but 
I — ” he shook his head. “Listen to 
his voice, Edwina. Listen to the 
way he talks. He’s got a Mexican 
accent — he’s struggling with it, but 
it’s there. When he fumbles for 



words he half-says the Spanish ones 
while he tries to remember the Eng- 
lish.” He looked up into her accus- 
ing eyes. “And listen to his words , 
Edwina! My God, a more absurd 
conglomeration of wishful thinking 
I never — he’s saying what will 
please you. He’s saying what you 
want to believe, about universal 
friendship and hands across the 
galaxies, and the cheapest science 
fictional fantasies about life on his 
Utopian, telepathic world. 

“I don’t know why he’s doing 
this, whether he’s a con man or 
crazy or believes it himself, but it’s 
all a pack of lies. I certainly won’t 
write a book about him — I would 
have to be either cruel or silly to do 
that.” 

“I believe him, Frank,” Edwina 
said. “I believe in him. What do 
you think of me for that? Does that 
make me silly? I know we have to 
be careful, but you’re being deliber- 
ately obtuse. Why would some Mex- 
ican tell us a story like his? What 
could he hope to gain? I don’t think 
he has a Mexican accent — you hear 
what you want to hear. Because he 
looks Mexican to you — you said so 
from the start — you assume his 
fumblings to form words in English 
sound like the fumblings of a man 
accustomed to speaking Spanish. 
How would you know what a man 
who never spoke any language at all 
would sound like if he began to 
struggle through English? I don’t 
know how you can be so deliber- 
ately deaf and blind to his truth.”

said. “He just doesn’t feel right to 



★ ★ ★ 

To piease Edwina, Frank taped 
several interviews with the strang- 
er, asking questions as probing and 
serious as if he needed the answers 
to convince the public. The problem 
was that this man Alph had nothing 
to back up his statements. Had no 
proof of anything — no spaceship, no 
alien metals or wonderful machines. 
He offered nothing but his fairy 
tales and Frank, who had always 
waited for something like this to 
happen, could not accept them. 

Freya, now that school was out 
for the summer, was always at 
hand. She sat in on all the interviews, 
but always quietly and unobtru- 
sively, seeming to drink in Alph’s 
words. 

Frank spent much of his time 
alone in his study, reading Texas 
history. He was digging tentatively 
for the topic of his next book — 
something biographical or historical, 
he thought. Something well- 
documented, factual and inarguable. 

Freya had a feeling things were 
starting to go wrong. This placid 
time would not last much longer. 

She and Alph went out walking 
one day, to the south pasture, near 
the dirty cattle pond where they 
sometimes swam. She knew some- 
thing was wrong before he spoke. 
Something was bothering him — he 



had been forgetting things, simple 
things, and her mother was begin- 
ning to notice. Her father might 
have noticed as well, but if he did 
he didn’t care. But her mother had 
questioned Alph closely, and her 
mother remembered when he gave a 
different answer to the same ques- 
tion asked twice. He’d been able to 
blame the confusion on the lan- 
guage, but that excuse wouldn’t last 
him forever. 

They stamped across stubby 
grass, cropped by the cattle down to 
the roots, and Alph said, “I’ve 
been remembering other things, 
Freya.” 

She looked at him sideways, and 
brushed an insect off her face. 

“I don’t mean about the things 
we talk about — not about my home 
planet. Other things. It’s like 
another life that I’m starting to re- 
member. Or someone else’s life.” 

Freya looked up and around at 
the huge blue sky. “That’s called 
dreaming, Alph,” she said. “You 
don’t have dreams in your world. 
That’s what is confusing you.” 

“But these memories come when 
I’m awake,” he said earnestly. 
“'‘They just float into my mind. 
Sometimes I look around and can’t 
think what I’m doing here. I wonder 
what happened to the hospital, and I 
wonder about my wife . .” He 
shut up abruptly and stared out at 
the distant horizon. Freya felt sick 
and sad. He was remembering one 
life and forgetting the other. He 
would be going soon.

“Then your wife’s name, can 
you remember that? Remember 
some time when you were home 
and you heard your wife answer the 
phone. ‘Yes, this is Mrs. ” 

Frank leaned forward, his arms rest- 
ing along his upper legs, his body 
tight and alert. 

Alph frowned. “I think ...” 

Freya pushed the door open. 

Her father looked around at her, 
annoyed. ‘‘Don’t interrupt us now, 
Freya.” 

“I just want to listen. I won’t 
talk.” 

Alph stared at the floor. Frank 
shrugged. “All right. Come in and 
be quiet.” He looked back at Alph. 
“Go on . what do you re- 
member?” 

After a moment Alph raised his 
head, his expression changed. “I 
think perhaps I’m picking up some- 
one else’s thoughts. My mind is 
very sensitive, like a radio receiver, 
and it’s still hard for me to separate 
the thoughts of people here. Some- 
times I get confused — I think other 
people’s thoughts without realizing 
it.” 

Frank looked at Alph as if he had 
suddenly pulled a dead rat out of 
his pocket. 

“Now wait a minute,” he said. 
“That’s not at all what — ” 

“There may be another explana- 
tion for it,” Alph said. “But I am 
satisfied with the one I’ve given 



you.” He stood. “I hope you’ll ex- 
cuse me — I’m feeling very tired.” 

Freya and Alph sat up late in the 
darkened guest room, talking. Freya 
was filled with sadness. Alph was 
fading away and another man was 
emerging — a man with another fam- 
ily and a past and future which did 
not contain her. He was still puz- 
zled by conflicting memories, by 
his two seperate yet united lives, 
but Freya knew. And she knew that 
he couldn’t stay here much longer. 

“Let’s go out for a walk,” she 
said, standing. 

Alph stood also, and looked down 
at her. The face of the full moon 
was at the window. Freya turned to 
look at it, away from the stranger’s 
troubled eyes. 

“Come on,’’ she said softly. 
“It’s time for you to go.”

“I think he probably went back 
home,” Frank said. “He was start- 
ing to remember things — time spent 
in a hospital, and a wife waiting for 
him down in Juarez.” 

“What does it take to make you 
believe?” Edwina cried. “And now 
that he’s disappeared you can say 
whatever you like and he can’t re- 
fute you.” 

“He never tried to,” Frank said. 
He looked at his wife’s tight, un- 
happy face and rose from the break- 
fast table to go to her and hold her 
unresponsive body. “Honey, he’s a 
mystery, all right? And he’s gone

out of our life as mysteriously and 
abruptly as he came into it.” 

Edwina twisted in his arms as 
Freya came into the kitchen. 
“Alph,” she said. 

“I know,” said Freya. “He told 
me last night he was leaving. He 
said he’d be back.” 

“He did? When? How soon?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Why did he go? Did he say?” 
Edwina moved closer to Freya and 
Frank returned to his chair with a 
sigh. 

Freya shook her head. “He said 
it was urgent. He said he had to get 
back, but that he wasn’t leaving us 
forever.” 

“Then he will be back, I’m sure 
of it,” Edwina said. 

Frank looked down at his cold 
grits and toast. He was no longer 
hungry. His chair screeched on the 
linoleum as he stood. 

“I’m going out for awhile,” he 
said. He needed to walk; the exer- 
cise and the open air would clear 
his head of the melancholy he had 
picked up from Edwina. He looked 
at Freya. “Want to go for a walk 
with your old Dad?” 

She shook her head, not looking 
at him. 

“Aw, come on.” He thought of 
all the aimless walks she had taken 
with the now-vanished Alph. “Do 
you good, Freya. We’ll go down 
and look at Miller’s cows and pre- 
tend they’re ours. We could fish in 
the tank.” 

“There aren’t any fish there. You 



said so.” She still wouldn’t look at 
him. 

She was missing Alph, he 
thought, and he was depressed that 
a stranger could affect her so. 

“We could pretend,” he said. 
“Don’t you remember how we used 
to pretend?” 

“I was a baby then,” she said. 
She glanced up at him and then 
away again. “Pretending is for 
babies.” 

So he went out by himself after 
all, whistling up his dogs for com- 
pany. He could think better by him- 
self, after all, and that was what he 
needed to do. 

He found the stranger floating 
face down in the filthy water of the 
cattle tank. 

★ ★ ★ 

Edwina wanted the tank drained. 

“He’s already dead,” Frank said, 
bewildered, his hand still resting on 
the phone he had used to call the 
sheriff. 

“He was trying to get to his 
spaceship,” Edwina said. “It must 
be at the bottom of the pond.” 

Frank stared at her as if he did 
now know her. He wondered briefly 
where Freya was, if she was listen- 
ing, and what effect all this would 
have on her. 

She had been very attached to the 
man. She needed some friends her 
own age. 

“Frank, do you hear me? We’ll 
have to call somebody in town, 



KIN TO KASPAR HAUSER

somebody with the equipment. We 
should do it right away. It doesn’t 
make sense to delay.” 

“It doesn’t make sense to do it at 
all,” Frank said reasonably. 
“There’s no spaceship at the bottom 
of the cow pond — there wouldn’t be 
a cow pond if something that big 
had dropped into it.” 

“We don’t know how big an 
alien spaceship would have to be. It 
might be very small — no bigger 
than a car.” 

“Honey, that tank isn’t any more 
than eight or nine feet deep. My 
Granddaddy dug it himself.” 
“Frank,” said Edwina with 
deadly sweetness. “You’ve got to 
look at this logically. He told Freya 
he was going home. He had his 
spaceship hidden somewhere. He 
must have been trying to get to it 
when something went wrong. Why 
else would we find him drowned in 
a cow pond? There is no other ex- 
planation possible.” 

★ ★ ★ 

They all stared at the flat, muddy 
bottom of the drained tank, studded 
here and there with light-colored 
stones thrown in other days by 
Freya or by Frank. 

“Guess the guy who died here 
must have walked in under his own 
steam,” said one of the men from 
town. He spat. He had wanted to 
stop when the tank was half- 
draine&^when it was obvious there 



was nothing sizable there. But Mrs. 
Hudspeth had insisted they drain it. 

She wanted to see the bottom. 

“No car here,” said the other 
man cheerfully. 

Freya gazed straight ahead, see- 
ing the pond as it had been shining 
almost black in the moonlight. 

She had stood then where she 
stood now, on the high bank, and 
she had watched him. 

“Go on,” she had said gently 
when he faltered at water’s edge. 
“It’s all right. You have on a spe- 
cial water-suit, remember? The 
water can’t hurt you — you can’t 
even feel it on your skin. The 
spaceship is on the bottom. The 
door will open to the pressure of 
your thumb and forefinger. The 
computer will open the door and 
welcome you in. There’s no prob- 
lem.” 

“Why are you making me go?” 
he asked, still hesitating. 

“Don’t you remember what you 
told me?” 

Her voice carried clearly on the 
still, night air. 

“About the spaceship?” 

She nodded. 

“I came here in it — you called 
me to you. ...” 

“No.” 

“Yes. You made me come. I 
never understood how or why — all I 
knew was you. That I had to come 
to you.” 

The hair whipped across her 
cheeks as she shook her head sharp- 
ly.

“Have you forgotten your own 
world?” 

“I ... I have to go back now.” 
He looked up at her for confirma- 
tion, and she nodded. “I ... I 
must go home to my people. I’ll be 
back someday — as soon as I can — 
but now I have to go back in my 
spaceship.” 

He walked into the water. 

Freya stood watching until he had 
disappeared, until the water was 
quiet and she knew he must have 
reached the bottom and found his 
spaceship. 

“Goodbye, Alph,” she whis- 
pered, the tears drying on her 
cheeks. 

“Freya.” Her mother’s voice 
drew her back to the present. “He 
must have made a mistake,” said 
Edwina, putting her arm around 
Freya. 



“A terrible mistake,” They 
walked away from the muddy site, 
leaving Frank to deal with the men 
from town. 

“I wonder if he was in touch 
with his home world,” Edwina 
mused. “If he was in touch with 
them, and they knew he was com- 
ing home, then perhaps when he 
doesn’t show up his friends will 
come looking for him.” She tight- 
ened her grip on Freya. “Well, no 
matter what, we have a book to get 
started on.” 

Freya felt a glow of warmth 
begin inside. She had a feeling — a 
certainty — that she would be help- 
ing her mother write this book. ★

pas: 






In a struggle to save the 
human race from extinction 
this Phoenix had but a single 
ally — Death . 



^^rapped in flesh, or in some- 
thing which gave the impression of 
flesh, Death came over the low 
horizon, across the perfectly level 
plain, to where I sat upon a dais- 
like rock. The rock was the one 
blemish on the surface of the land. 
There were no stars in the black, ut- 
terly black sky, no clouds, nothing 
at all. 

Death halted before and slightly 
to one side of me. Its cloak rippled 
animatedly, though there was no 
breeze. The golden almonds of its 
eyes glistened in the sockets of its 
serene androgynous face. Death’s 
mouth was a wide, lipless seam lo- 
cated somewhere below the merest 
hint of a nose. The mouth opened, 
and Death said, We are very near 
the end now. You surely realize 
this. 

Yes. I’ve known it for some 
time. 

Are you ready to take my hand 
now? 

I looked at Death’s strong, color- 
less fingers and shook my head. In 



a few minutes, perhaps. Or a few 
hours. 

What difference can a few more 
minutes or hours possibly make? 

Indeed. What difference? 

Death made a small, soft sound 
very like a sigh, half-turned and in- 
dicated the featureless plain, the 
empty sky, with a wave of its hand. 
What can you do? it demanded. I 
have wound down the universe 
around you, nibbled it away, taken 
everything save what you see before 
you. Soon, even this will be gone. 
What can you do? 

You can’t touch me, I reminded 
it, unless I ask you. 

Something flared behind each of 
Death’s eyes, twin miniature suns 
going nova. The corners of its 
mouth quivered angrily. I can take 
you whenever I choose! 

But you won’t. You don’t want 
to take me. What satisfaction would 
that give you? 

Death was silent and unmoving 
for a long time. Then it shook its 
head sadly, helplessly, and said. 
None. No satisfaction at all. 

It won’t be long, I said, as gently 
as I could. I'm tired. 1 want to rest. 
I have one last thing to do. Be pa- 
tient. 

Again the hand was offered. You 
have no choice, Death said. No 
choice at all. 

Light glimmered on the horizon 
to my right. Streaks of gray light 
stabbed upward into the darkness. 

I have to go now, I said, rising. 

Why? 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 



77 



To try again. I have to try again. 

It isn’t worth it. I can give you 
peace now. 

I want atonement first. 

Death’s hand dropped to its side. 
The mask did not change, but I 
sensed, somehow, that the expres- 
sion behind it was one of faintly 
exasperated resignation. You’ll be 
back soon, Death called after me as 
J walked toward the edge of the 
universe. 

Yes, I called back. I’m sure of it. 
Soon. 

When I reached the horizon, the 
razor-edged rim of the disk that had 
become my world, I paused for a 
moment to look down into the 
milky glowing orb hanging in the 
darkness below. The orb dimpled, 
opened up and became a ring of 
light, the mouth of a tunnel. I 
stepped forward, off, away, and fell 
toward it, into the heat, a phoenix 
diving toward its funeral pyre, and I 
did not stop falling until I had 
emerged, unseared, untouched by 
any flame, at its far end. 

Cool, efficient fingers were ad- 
justing the straps when I regained 
consciousness. I lay listening to the 
hum of machinery, the muted whir 
of duct fans trying to suck the 
stench of sweat and other 
effluvia — mine, all of it — from the 
air in the room. Light from the ceil- 
ing seeped pinkly through my 
eyelids. I counted slowly to twenty, 
then let them flutter open. 

Faces above me: serene an- 
drogynous masks with golden one- 

78 



way lenses for eyes, wide, im- 
mobile mouths without lips; the face 
shared by my three interrogators. 

There had always been three of 
them, since the first. Whether the 
people behind the masks were al- 
ways the same, I could not tell. I 
had no way of telling, no way of 
keeping track of them as they 
moved into and out of my field of 
vision, no way of knowing how 
much time I had spent on the in- 
quisition table. But each of the 
three appeared to have been as- 
signed a definite role to play. 

I had given them the names of 
the ancient Fates. 

Atropos, the Unchangeable, 
stayed in the background for the 
most part, never speaking, never 
taking part in the proceedings. Even 
so, Atropos struck me as the most 
sinister and terrifying of the three. 
Atropos did not care what I might 
say or not say on the table. At- 
ropos, severer of the thread of life, 
waited only for me to die. 

Lachesis, the Disposer of Lots, 
was the one who actually handled 
the knives and needles, who de- 
cided where the electrodes were to 
be placed on my body, who lov- 
ingly and knowledgeably plied the 
trade of torture. Lachesis wanted 
me to break, to beg for mercy, to 
protest the unfairness of my predi- 
cament. 

Clotho, the Spinner, played a rel- 
atively sympathetic part. Clotho 
wanted me to give in, tell all, and 
thus spare myself further misery. I 



GALAXY 




was willing to oblige Clotho, and I 
had already done so, in fact. But 
Clotho wouldn’t believe me, having 
been led to expect nothing but lies 
from me, and I, having been trained 
to tell nothing but lies, 1 couldn’t 
make her or him believe me. 

Clotho’ s mask now hovered just 
above my face, its mouth and mine 
almost kissing. 

“You have nothing to gain,’’ the 
Spinner said in an imploring tone, 
“nothing at all, by refusing to tell 
us the truth. What my colleague 
here’’ — the mask glanced politely at 
Lachesis — “has done to you is but 
a taste of what can be done to 
you . ’ ’ 

“Can and will, traitor,’’ Lachesis 
put in, “unless you tell us what we 
want to know.” 

Clotho nodded solemnly and 
began caressing my slimy cheek 
with a velvet-sheathed hand. It felt 
good, soothing. It was supposed to. 
“You must believe me when I say 
that my colleague is quite merciless. 
We are prepared to go to any 
lengths to obtain the information 
you persist in withholding from us. 
We have at our disposal here a truly 
impressive array of interrogation 
techniques. Some of them date back 
to ancient times.” 

Yes, yes. I had heard all of this 
before: it was the Spinner’s litany; 
there was no telling how many 
times I had had it recited to me 
since being put on the table, but I 
knew most of it by heart now. We 
have a crude but time-honored de- 



vice known as the thumbscrew. We 
can put you on a thing called the 
rack and pull your arms, your legs, 
out of their sockets. We know how 
to break ninety percent of the bones 
in your body without killing you. 
We have only begun to show you 
what we have in our inventory of 
pain. We can kill you by slow de- 
grees, and we will if you force us 
to it. We have a lot of time, infinite 
patience, and we have you. 

I opened my mouth. It hurt. 
“I’ve told ...” My voice sounded 
thick and strange. I moved my jaw 
experimentally, wondering what 
Lachesis had done to it during my 
last absence. “I’ve told you the 
truth. What you need to know.” 
Clotho continued to stroke my 
face. “Preposterous lies. We want 
to know what really brought you to 
Earth, what your orders were. 
What you were supposed to ac- 
complish here, and how.” 

“I came to warn you.” 

Lachesis raised a metal-gloved 
hand to show me the instrument at- 
tached to the top of the index fin- 
ger, then lowered it. The instrument 
came to rest somewhere on my 
torso. I gave a cry, writhed on the 
table, tried to push my body 
through it, away from the source of 
the sharp, gnawing agony. I could 
have escaped by simply letting go 
of my flesh and returning to my 
dais-like rock, but I didn’t. I had 
rested there. I had returned to the 
table knowing what to expect. So I 
bore the pain until Lachesis saw fit 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 



79 




to remove the hand. The pain took 
its time going away. 

“The truth,” whispered Clotho. 

I sucked in a ragged breath. 
“The truth. I am the . sole sur- 
vivor of the colony ... on Vega 
IV. 

Above me, Lachesis made a 
sound like a cat spitting. 

“The colony,” I went on, “and 
the settlement on the larger moon 
was gone. Destroyed.” 

“Wiped out,” Clotho murmured, 
“by an invasion armada of un- 
known but certainly not terrestial 
origin. So you’ve told us. Now — ” 

“It’s true ,” I moaned. The Spin- 
ner beckoned to the Disposer of 
Lots. I closed my eyes and was 
thinking longingly of my faraway 
rock when the pain exploded in my 
head, too intense, too sudden, for 
me to effect escape. 

“You must believe me,” I man- 
aged to gasp when Lachesis drew 
away. The Disposer of Lots had 
been working at the tender tissues 
lining my nasal cavity with a deli- 
cate needle-bladed instrument. I 
sniffed carefully. There was no 
blood. 

“You are a spy,” Lachesis said 
harshly. 

“An ...” Clotho rubbed metal 
lips thoughtfully. “An operative. 
1-and-E. An intelligence-and- 
espionage agent of the Vegan Colo- 
nial government. Do you deny 
this?” 

“No. I told you that myself. Be- 
fore.” 



“Do you deny that Vega IV has 
been conducting intelligence and 
espionage activity here on Earth, 
with the intention of subverting the 
authority of — ” 

“I deny it. I deny knowledge of 
it.” I paused, gathering breath and 
strength. “There was a separatist 
faction in the Vegan colonial gov- 
ernment. I was investigating a 
member of that faction, in the ser- 
vice and interest of Earth, when the 
invaders appeared out of nowhere 
and razed everything to the ground. 
The fact that I was . my being 
an agent had nothing to do with my 
coming here. I was the only one 
left, the only one who could come. 
I identified myself as an agent of 
the Vegan Intelligence Network 
immediately upon my arrival. Prior 
to planetfall. Use your brains. If I’d 
come here to engage in subversive 
activities, would I have established 
at the first that I’m — that I was em- 
ployed by the VIN? I’m telling you 
that the VIN no longer exists. The 
invaders obliterated it, along with 
the government and the separatists 
and everything else.” 

For an instant, the two Fates 
locked eyes across me, and for just 
that instant I thought that I might 
have gotten through to them at last. 
Then Lachesis repeated the cat- 
spitting noise. 

“What do you hope to gain by 
this?” Clotho. 

“Who were you to meet on 
Earth? Names.” Lachesis. 

“What was your objective?” 



80 



GALAXY 




“To warn Earth. To give you 
time to prepare defenses.” 

“Lies.” Flat, dead, deadly, the 
voice of the Disposer of Lots. 
“Lies. There was no armada. You 
came here to meet certain people. 
You came to help them undermine 
the authority of Earth.” 

“The armada is real. You must 
believe me. If the invaders come — ” 
“Absurd.” Pitying, the voice of 
the Spinner. “Come now, be rea- 
sonable. It grieves me, you know, 
to see you in torment, and need- 
lessly so. In the end, we’ll have the 
truth. We’ll get it, one way or 
another. There probably won’t be 
much left of you by then. Re- 
member that we have a vast number 
of diverse interrogation techniques 
at our disposal. Old and new. The 
thumbscrew, the rack, the nerve- 
needles, the burnbuds, the boot, the 
psychpick. Why — ” 

“Vm telling you the truth!" 

Clotho nodded to Lachesis, who 
jammed something under my sole 
remaining fingernail. I screamed. 
“The truth,” said the Spinner. 

I sobbed out the truth. Invasion 
armada. Five hundred or a thousand 
vessels. Origin unknown. Vega IV 
scoured clean. The lunar settlement 
destroyed. My hairbreadth escape. 
The three Fates listened patiently, 
believing none of it, soft-spoken 
Spinner, cruel Disposer of Lots, si- 
lent Unchangeable. When I had 
finished, Clotho’s velvet hand was 
on my face again. 

“Our friend here,” Clotho said 



to Lachesis, “patently isn’t going to 
yield under pain of mere physical 
mutilation. Perhaps the time has 
come to use the psychpick.” 

Lachesis shook her head, or his. 
“Let us proceed patiently, step by 
step. The pick will shatter the mind 
but leave the body untouched. Use 
up the flesh first.” 

I heard a faint clink, metal on 
metal. Lachesis' gauntlet rose into 
view. There was still another at- 
tachment mounted on the forefinger. 

“How can I make you believe 
me?” I asked wearily as Lachesis 
touched me. No one bothered to an- 
swer. I felt the careful nip of some- 
thing sharp, felt skin part. With a 
mental shrug of disgust, I cut my- 
self free of flesh and went back to 
my rock under the blank night sky. 
Death was standing where I had left 
it. The golden eyes glittered hun- 
grily as I seated myself, but the 
hand was not offered. The horizon 
seemed lower than before. Lower 
and closer. Beside me, Death 
smiled fleetingly. 

You’re too smug to bear, 1 told 
it, turning my back. 

★ ★ ★ 

I had been tortured once before, 
on Vega IV — tortured for real, by a 
man who lacked the Fates’ arsenal 
but not their zeal, as opposed to tor- 
tured for training. The man had 
done his best with a few 
superheated instruments. He had 
known what he was about, but he 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 



81 




picked the wrong subject: the whole 
thrust of VIN’s training program for 
intelligence-and-espionage field per- 
sonnel was in the general direction 
of stoicism. If the pain was bad, I 
could live with it; if it was worse, I 
could retreat from my nerve endings 
until it got better; if it was worst, I 
could phoenix — make myself die. 
But, bad or worse, I would never 
come out from under my cover, 
never give the game away, never 
spill my guts. 

The man with the superheated in- 
struments had just made the transi- 
tion from bad to worse, and was 
surely planning on sending me the 
whole way, when my back-up ar- 
rived and shot off a piece of his 
face. Even then, this timely inter- 
ruption notwithstanding, there 
wasn’t much left of my own face. 

I lost the six months which fol- 
lowed, four of them in a clinic 
where I grew a new face, two on 
mandatory post-operation (in two 
senses of the term) leave, a rest- 
and-recuperation junket to Gar- 
denspot in the Southern Islands. 
Standard VIN policy regarding 
agents temporarily disabled in the 
line of duty. 

Two months of getting used to a 
new face. It didn’t please me nearly 
as much as the first one I’d had. 
The mouth was too much of a 
slash, the skin too tight on the 
cheekbones and at the temples. In 
mirrors, I looked meaner, grimmer, 
altogether too much like what I 
was. An old lover, somebody with 



whom I have taken my VIN basic 
training, turned up in Gardenspot 
and found the new face exciting. 
We renewed our relationship for a 
while, long enough for it to be 
realized by both parties that the rest 
of me was the same as ever, no 
more exciting than it had been be- 
fore. A new lover, a local, came 
along and didn’t know the differ- 
ence. 

I swam, ran, kept busy, pre- 
tended to be having a lovely time 
for the benefit of the, ah, total 
strangers who were, ah, observing 
me. VIN was always anxious to see 
how close calls affected its agents. I 
would have been at Gardenspot for 
six months if I’d phoenixed. Dying, 
even temporarily, was never good 
for a person, trained agent or not. 

Mostly, I read the faxsheets and 
tried to figure out what was happen- 
ing up north. The separatist move- 
ment, spawned on Polyphemus, 
Vega IV’s larger moon, almost fifty 
years before, almost as soon as that 
settlement had become self- 
sufficient, was still gaining ground 
in and out of official circles. Some 
politicians were hinting broadly that 
the time had indeed arrived for Ve- 
gans to sever Earth’s apron 
strings — peacefully, of course — and 
go their own way in the universe. 
Some private citizens had become 
less circumspect in their denuncia- 
tions of the colonial government. 
The home-grown separatists had 
their staunch supporters on Earth, 
too. 



82 



GALAXY 




Anti-empire sentiment was be- 
coming fashionable. 

I sifted through the faxsheets and 
learned that things were really start- 
ing to come unglued. The demon- 
strations and acts of political van- 
dalism had begun. WHO NEEDS 
EARTH? someone had scrawled on 
a wall of the governor’s mansion in 
New Portland. The riots were just 
beginning. Separatist-minded indus- 
trialists on Polyphemus had closed 
down their mines, with the support 
of the miners. There had been a 
short-lived mutiny aboard the 
Slothrop , a Terran-owned, Vegan- 
operated ore freighter based on the 
moon. 

The secret war was already well 
under way: VIN, by the authority 
vested in it by Terran Network Cen- 
tral, had been keeping tabs on 
separatists and fellow-travelers for 
more than forty years; during the 
past twenty-four months, however, 
VIN had progressed from mere sur- 
veillance and petty harrassment to 
carefully engineered scandals, 
studiedly malicious industrial sabo- 
tage, an occasional discreet assassi- 
nation. And, as I knew from per- 
sonal experience, to some bloody 
encounters with separatist agents. 
VIN was walking a tightrope now, 
doing its best to undermine the 
separatist cause on Vega IV and, at 
the same time, keep Central from 
letting the Terran Intelligence Net- 
work take over. Networks within 
networks. Nothing but politics. 

Finally, my Gardenspot time was 



up. I had a last night-long tumble 
with my new lover, packed my bags 
and went gratefully to the airport. I 
forgot the lover’s name, put the de- 
tails of the whole two-month period 
out of my head, as soon as my 
plane lifted off and away to bear me 
north, back to New San Angeles 
and VIN and work. 

Naomi Sizemore had a car wait- 
ing for me when I got there. 

Naomi Sizemore operated out of 
a sparsely furnished office on the 
second floor of VIN’s New San 
Angeles headquarters. She had been 
there, from all accounts, for more 
than twenty years; I never saw her 
outside that one room, and if she 
had ever left the second floor for 
any reason at any time, no one I’d 
talked to knew of it. She was a 
big-boned, broad-shouldered wom- 
an, as dark and as hard as teak- 
wood. As always, she was seated 
behind her desk when I entered the 
office. She didn’t look up. Spread 
like a fan across her desktop were 
the contents of several folders. 

“Good to have you back,’’ she 
muttered as I closed the door. 

“It’s good to be back.’’ 

Sizemore grunted softly, the best 
she could do or had ever done in 
the way of laughter, and finally fa- 
vored me with an inspection. When 
she finished, she let her gaze drop 
back to the papers before her. 

“You look a considerable bit less 
grisly than I remember,’’ she said. 
“Ornish showed me some pictures. 
Pictures taken of you after your 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 



83 




back-up brought you home. Ugly.” 
”1 never got to thank him.” 

She shot me an astonished 
glance. “What?” 

“1 didn’t get to thank my back- 
up for showing up when he did.” 
“Don’t be a sentimental asshole. 
He was doing his job. And not very 
damned well, either. He should 
have arrived twenty or thirty min- 
utes earlier than he did. Before you 
took your first cut.” 

1 remembered that first cut and 
shuddered. Fortunately, Sizemore 
was looking at her papers again. 

“Anyway,” she said, “don’t 
waste your time looking around for 
him. He phoenixed on an assign- 
ment about eight weeks ago. He 
didn’t come out of it.” 

“But . why? How?” 

“Does it God-damned matter 
what he did wrong?” Sizemore 
stabbed a finger at me savagely. 
“He messed up. He opted for the 
phoenix route when he shouldn’t 
have, he didn’t do it right. And 
now he’s dead, irrevocably dead. 
Frankly, he won’t be missed. You 
and I and VIN have more important 
things to think about.” 

“Yes. Of course. I . it’s just 
that. ...” 

Her eyes fastened on my face. 
Like iron claws. Or superheated 
pincers. 

“Nothing,” I finished lamely. 
“Never mind.” 

She stared at me for a moment 
longer before nodding slightly, ap- 
parently satisfied that I would not 



be a sentimental asshole. She 
plucked up a sheet of paper by its 
corner and let it dangle between 
thumb and forefinger. “Now. 
You’ve never been to Poly- 
phemus/’ It was not a question. 
“That changes as of 0800 tomor- 
row. The lunar settlement is 
becoming” — a bleak- grin — 
“unsettled. You surely heard that 
the miners called a strike. And 
about mutiny aboard an ore freight- 
er called the Slothrop .” 

“I read a lot of faxsheets in Gar- 
denspot.” 

Sizemore nodded again. “So I 
heard. Well. You’re going to 
Polyphemus tomorrow' morning. 
Paula Crist and her friends have 
been busy up there.” 

I started. “Crist? On Polyph — ” 

“She took up residence there a 
month ago. Slipped out of New 
Portland without so much as a by- 
your-leave. Gave us the shake for 
forty-eight hours, and forty-eight 
hours too soon. We’d had plans for 
her.” 

I didn’t bother to ask about that. 
I knew any number of ways in 
which VIN’s plans for Paula Crist 
might have been carried out. Noth- 
ing so crude and obvious as a bullet 
or a hit-and-run or a plane crash for 
as prominent and outspoken a 
separatist as Paula Crist. A heart at- 
tack, maybe. Or a specially pre- 
pared meal: people still choked to 
death on misrouted food. 

“How did she know?” I asked. 
“About the plans.”

Sizemore frowned deeply. “You 
missed a lot. We plugged a leak in 
VIN security eleven days ago. 
Anyway. Crist is with her friends 
on Polyphemus, where we’ll have 
no little trouble getting at her. Lots 
of faithful bodyguards. She has one 
of the most powerful anti-Earth in- 
dustrialists on the moon looking out 
for her. Mister No-Tithe-For-Terra 
himself.” 

“Brian Subotsky.” 

“Yes.” 

“What am I supposed to do?” 
“Crist still needs killing. If you 
can penetrate her screen of 
bodyguards — we're working on that 
now — her death on the moon should 
actually do us more good than it 
would have on-planet. The settle- 
ment’s already stirred up. The 
strikes, the Slothrop mutiny. 
Loyalists fear for their lives. If Crist 
dies, and dies in such a way that, 
one” — Sizemore bent back a finger, 
counting off — “it cannot be proved 
that we had anything to do with it, 
and yet, two, it can be suspected by 
her paranoid friends that we’re re- 
sponsible . well, instead of send- 
ing in a single lightly armed deep- 
ranger to quell mutiny aboard an 
ore freighter. ...” 

She let her voice trail off and 
gave me an expectant look. 

“The governor,” I said, “would 
send in the Fleet to put down a 
full-scale armed insurrection. 
Loyalist lives and property would 
have to be protected, the peace pre- 
served.” 



“Exactly. On-planet, the public 
would stand by the governor. 
Ramington and the other pacifistic 
separatists would be damned by the 
insurrectionists’ violence.” A quick 
grin of triumph touched the corners 
of Sizemore’s mouth. “The separatist 
movement will be smashed, we’ll 
have demonstrated once and for all 
that VIN can police its own planet, 
without interference from TIN, 
and . and that will be that.” 

“And then ...” I bit off the 
uncompleted question. And then, 
what? I had been a VIN agent for 
five years. Half a decade of field- 
work in the worst interests of the 
separatist cause. VIN itself had 
been in existence for forty-eight 
years. Half a century, almost, of 
keeping the colony running 
smoothly, or reasonably so. 

If Sizemore was right, if Crist 
died, if everything turned out the 
way Sizemore said it would ... if 
the fifty-year secret war finally 
ended . what then? 

Cutbacks, gradual but inexorable. 
Entire sections phased out of opera- 
tion. The Vegan Intelligence Net- 
work demobilized, its work having 
been done, its enemies vanquished, 
the purpose for which it was created 
served. 

Or. 

A whole new war. With new 
enemies. 

And who would the enemy be? 

The answer, of course (of 
course?), was: Terran Intelligence 
Network. The pushy men and 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 






85 




women who could not accept that 
VIN knew best how to deal with 
Vegan internal disunities. 

The schism between the two or- 
ganizations had widened at an 
alarming rate during the past couple 
of years, widened in direct propor- 
tion, it seemed, to the rising inten- 
sity of separatist activism. Politics. 
Inter-organizational rivalry. 

And, at the heart of it, not a little 
professional jealousy. For reasons 
known only to the heads of TIN 
(Sizemore’s favorite joke; perhaps 
her only joke), learning to phoenix 
was not part of a TIN basic- 
trainee’s curriculm. TIN had flatly 
rejected the phoenixing technique, 
possibly because they didn’t con- 
sider it vital to agent survival or 
couldn’t understand it, possibly be- 
cause it was a VIN development. 

Whatever the reasons, the result 
was that TIN had lost a lot of 
people in the field. Permanently. 

VIN had lost some. Not many, 
and not always for good. 

VIN versus TIN, then. It 
wouldn't be a war for field agents, 
no killings, no torture, no nastiness. 
Not at first, anyway. It would come 
down to sniping on the bureaucratic 
level. Surveillance and petty 
harassment. 

Full circle. 

Not for me, I decided. I preferred 
to fight real foes. 

I shook off my VIN-vermy-TIN 
fantasy — it had to be nothing more 
than that, I told myself, a 
fantasy. 



“When should Crist die?’’ 
Sizemore exhaled noisily. “Soon. 
Before things can grow quiet on 
Polyphemus. We'll know exactly 
when you’re going to do it after 
we’ve figured out how to get you 
close to her.” 

A thought occurred to me. 
“What if . is there any record of 
her having trained to die?” 

“No. Good question, though.’’ 
She gestured at the papers on her 
desk. “There are so many gaps in 
our Paula Crist profile. Things I’d 
feel safer knowing. Where was she, 
what was she doing, during the 
eleven-month period between the 
Boyd incident and her sudden 
reemergence in New Portland last 
fall? On Earth? In a hidey-hole in 
the building across the street? 
Trial-phoenixing on some island re- 
treat in the southern hemisphere? In 
all, thirty-one months of the past six 
years of her life are a complete 
blank. Where does she go? What 
does she do?’’ Sizemore made a 
face. “How come I know what she 
eats for breakfast and what she likes 
in bed, but not where she vanished 
to?’’ 

“Will it matter,'' I said, very 
quietly, kk once she’s dead?’’ 

Sizemore forced a shrug. “No." 
Meaning: Yes. Sizemore did not 
like enigmas. “Anyway. You must 
be sure to kill her irreparably. To- 
tally. Without warning. It may have 
to be a messy death.’’ 

“Perhaps. Phoenix or not, there 
are still many ways a person can die 



86 



GALAXY 




without hope of resurrection.” 

★ ★ ★ 

You spoke of atonement, Death 
said, not looking at me, not look- 
ing at anything in particular. 
Atonement for what? 

You should know. You must 
know. 

Ah. Of course. The people you 
killed. Death laughed softly. It was 
a liquid sound. I was reminded of 
the noise water makes as it gurgles 
down a drain. They’re dead. Ev- 
eryone dies. 

That doesn’t make it any less un- 
pleasant. 

A strange attitude for one of your 
particular background. A spy. An 
assassin. A phoenix. 

I’ve had too much time to think 
about those people. They’re gone 
forever. Ended. No coming back for 
any of them. I took their lives in 
the line of duty. And now my du- 
ty .. there’s nothing left to justify 
those killings. My cause died with 
Vega IV. 

If you had not killed them when 
you did, the invaders would have 
taken care of them later. Death 
shrugged within its cloak. Either 
way, it doesn’t matter. Everything 
has to end, sooner or later. People’s 
lives, causes, worlds. I alone am 
inevitable and eternal. Even for a 
phoenix, one who dies ten, a 
hundred times, there is no such thing 
as inevitable resurrection. The 
phoenix will rise nine or ninety-nine 



times. But never the tenth. Never 
the last. 

I got to my feet. The horizon was 
less than a dozen paces away. 

You don’t have to go back, 
Death murmured. Atonement is as 
pitiful a delusion as guilt. Or duty. 

Do you ever lose patience? Have 
you ever felt . cheated? 

No one has ever cheated me. 

I walked away. Pausing at the 
edge of the universe, I said, over 
my shoulder, How boring it must be 
for you. 

And then, back to the inquisition 
table. Back to the Fates. 

Atropos, as before, was hovering 
in the background, just at the edge 
of my proscribed field of vision, 
shadowy, sinister, unspeaking still. 

Lachesis was moving about, 
checking various machines arranged 
in a close semi-circle about the head 
of the table. There was a snaky 
mass of wires and tubing clinging to 
my skull, a Medusa-crown connect- 
ing me to the machines. By cau- 
tiously flexing a muscle here, a 
muscle there, I discerned that the 
nerve-needle has been inserted — 
there would be a last round of 
purely physical pain to soften me up 
for the piece de resistance , the 
psychpick. 

Use up the flesh first, Lachesis 
had said to Clotho. 

And Clotho? The Spinner stood 
waiting beside the table. Waiting 
gracelessly, it seemed to me. The 
velvet-gloved hands, drawn up 
against the breast like claws, could 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 



87 




not be still. The fingers kept twin- 
ing, writhing, as boneless as 
worms. I looked up at Clotho’s 
smooth gleaming face in surprise 
and wonder. Perspiring and wor- 
ried, perhaps, behind the metal 
mask? Trembling and nervous 
within the loose gray robes? 

Then Clotho glanced down at me, 
saw that I was awake again and 
forced him- or herself to be still. 

“How can you let this be done to 
you?” the Spinner demanded, ges- 
turing at the machines. 

I managed the grin weakly. “I 
don’t appear to have any choice.” 

“You can still save yourself. By 
telling the truth. Why are you on 
Earth? Who were you to meet? 
What was your plan?” I said noth- 
ing. Clotho leaned down into my 
face. “Don’t you know what the 
nerve-needles can do? The 
psychpick? Spare yourself. Tell us 
everything about the separatist un- 
derground on Earth.” Oh. So. 

★ ★ ★ 

I centered the telescope-sight’s 
crosshairs on the bridge of Paula 
Crist’s fine nose, drew in a slow, 
deep breath and held it. Paula Crist, 
whom the Vegan colonial governor 
had publicly called “misguided” 
and, in private, “the single most 
dangerous woman on the planet,” 
was a remarkably attractive person 
of sixty-one years, with alert eyes, 
high cheekbones, a sand-colored 
scalplock. She was engaged in con- 



versation with none other than Brian 
Subotsky, over whose shoulder I 
aimed. Before I could pull the trig- 
ger, Paula Crist moved her head, 
seemed to look in my direction, to 
give me a droll smirk across a dis- 
tance of a kilometer. 1 shifted the 
crosshairs a fraction of a degree, 
compensating for her movement, 
and blew her head off her shoul- 
ders. 

I set the last plate of food, the 
compote, on the table, placing it 
carefully between Paula Crist’s 
forearms. She murmured thanks ab- 
sently and smiled in response to a 
witticism from one of her three din- 
ner companions. In the shadows, in 
the darkened corners of the dining 
room, were silent, glowering figures, 
the ever-present watchdogs who 
had committed themselves to the 
business of keeping Paula Crist 
from harm. 1 repressed a smile as I 
withdrew from the room, a flawless 
imitation of a waiter. From the 
corner of my eye, I saw Paula Crist 
take up a silver spoon and gesture 
with it elegantly. Then I was out of 
the room, moving briskly through 
the kitchen, to the alley behind the 
building. Paula Crist’s metal utensil 
must have dipped into the compote 
as I was closing the door: there was 
a loud explosion, and the building 
itself trembled perceptibly. 

I was a refugee separatist poet 
and scholar of somewhat modest 
accomplishments, and I was being 
introduced to Paula Crist at a large 
party at Brian Subotsky’s palatial 



88 



GALAXY 




house. Paula Crist and I shook 
hands in a perfunctory manner, 
mouthed a few banalities — strangers 
being polite to each other. There 
was death in the faint film of per- 
spiration on the palm of my hand. 
Paul Crist died, as did selected 
others among Brian Subotsky’s 
guests, within a few days, of some- 
thing which the cororner mistook 
for botulism. 

I was sitting before the control 
console of Terran Fleet Type I 
Deep-Ranger TF 861, watching the 
cold gray eye of Polyphemus grow 
in the teleview, fantasizing Paula 
Crist’s death, fitting her and other 
leading separatist figures into dead 
people’s roles, the parts played by 
my past victims. Sterner, decapi- 
tated by a traser beam at one 
kilometer; the Boyds, blown up 
with a doctored dessert; Glendan 
Beutal and select accomplices, in- 
fected. Killing time. 

I was twelve hundred kilometers 
out from Polyphemus, sailing along 
beautifully, taking my time. I had 
had twenty-one sleepless hours, and 
I felt great. There’d been briefings 
with Naomi Sizemore’s people, a 
grueling session in the VIN bio- 
chem labs, where I adopted my 
invented-for-the-occasion persona, 
let myself be so completely ab- 
sorbed by that new identity, that lie, 
that the real me couldn’t be rooted 
out by psychpick or red-hot tongs. 
A whole complex plan had been 
conceived, worked out to the small- 
est possible detail, then set in mo- 



tion in the space of a mere twenty - 
one hours. 

It would have worked. 

I was a flawless, flawless imita- 
tion of a highly qualified Fleet offi- 
cer, thanks to injections of RNA 
culled from the real thing, and I 
was the sole person aboard a fully 
equipped Fleet deep-ranger. Type I: 
full traser complement; booster ram 
and faster-than-light propulsion unit; 
a marvelously sophisticated piece 
of hardware. On its way to 
Polyphemus to relieve TF 801, 
which had been locked in orbit 
around the moon ever since putting 
down the Slothrop mutiny. A 
routine changing of the guard. 

Only the word had been gotten 
out, with the Vegan Intelligence 
Network’s customary circumspec- 
tion, that TF 861 ’s crew of one 
might, just might . ah, well, 
what the more militant separatists 
could do with a deep-ranger, par- 
ticularly if it should come complete 
with a highly qualified Fleet officer 
to operate it. An officer rumored to 
entertain certain small . doubts. 

It would have worked. It would 
have gotten me into the good graces 
of the separatists and, thence, close 
to my target — not quickly, but soon 
enough. Everything would have 
worked out as planned. I would 
even have died convincingly, a 
traitor paying the price. 

Damn it, it would have worked! 

With characteristic unconcern for 
human affairs, the universe threw a 
curve.

At exactly 1000 hours, New Port- 
land Time, 7-11-2293, TF 861 ’s 
shipcomm said, “Attention, all 
Fleet vessels. Condition Yellow. 
Cruiser Frampton reports sighting 
fifteen unidentified craft of super- 
dreadnaught mass in Sector 13, 
eight degrees above orbital plane, 
decelerating from light-velocity. 
Closing fast. Phase-in point un- 
known. Sector 13, status go. Pro- 
ceed to interception point, coordi- 
nates following on private channels. 
Sectors 11, 12, 14, status ready. 
Sectors 8 through 10, status alert, 
hold your positions.” 

Followed by, “Sector 13 esti- 
mates time till initial interception 
four minutes, eight seconds.” 

And then, slightly less than four 
and one-half minutes later, by, “All 
Fleet vessels, all sectors, Condition 
Red. TF 39Q reports all other Fleet 
interceptors in Sector 13 destroyed. 
Sectors 11, 12, 14, status go, inter- 
cept, coordinates following. Sectors 
8 through 10, status ready.” 

Vega IV’s secret war between the 
separatist underground and Terran 
Network Central’s two intelligence 
sub-networks was at an end, unex- 
pectedly, prematurely, inconclu- 
sively. Permanently. I didn’t know 
it then, of course. I didn’t think 
about it. All I did, all I could do, 
was sit uselessly in my ship, 
mocked by the PROGRAM AC- 
TION light flashing on my console, 
unable to accompany TF 801 when 
it broke away from Polyphemus and 
sped off to enter the fray, unpre- 



pared to participate in space com- 
bat. I was no longer quite so flaw- 
less an imitation of the men and 
women in the Fleet: RNA was good 
only for so much. I sat listening in 
disbelief to the reports coming in 
over shipcomm. 

The first fifteen vessels to pop 
into normal space out beyond the 
orbit of Vega V were halfway to 
IV, decelerating incredibly, at a rate 
which nothing living could have en- 
dured, when thirty identical ships 
showed up behind them, then sixty 
more, a hundred-twenty more, wave 
upon geometrically progressive 
wave of titanic warcraft, an un- 
stoppable wedge plunging deep into 
the Vegan system. Berserkers from 
nowhere. Robot invaders, possibly, 
dispatched by some unknown, un- 
suspected alien race. Or — equally 
possible — a machine armada run- 
ning out of control, creations which 
had outlived their creators and now 
moved through the galaxy. At ran- 
dom? In accordance with programs 
implanted millenia before, by be- 
ings long since extinct? 

The why of it wasn’t the most 
important thing at the moment. The 
universe was capricious. The inva- 
sion armada was upon us. People 
were being killed. 

Shipcomm gave me a concise, in- 
flectionless account of the armada’s 
progress as it sliced into and 
through the Fleet. Sector 1 2 ’ s 
deep-rangers annihilated, one at- 
tacker reported crippled by concen- 
trated traser fire. The cruiser 



90 



GALAXY 




Frampton destroyed by the second 
wave of incoming super-dread- 
naughts, one attacker reported vapor- 
ized. Sector 14’s deep-rangers de- 
stroyed. 

The Maas and Mexico, Terra- 
hound ore freighters, were overta- 
ken a scant ten gigameters out from 
Vega IV. They had been accelerat- 
ing toward light-velocity, but they 
were still moving too slowly to kick 
in their f-t-1 units when the invaders 
met them head-on. I turned to my 
controls at this point and punched 
out PROGRAM: EXTREME EVA- 
SIVE ACTION— BOOSTER RAM 
ACCELERATION, and TF 861 
began to angle downward from the 
orbital plane, removing itself from the 
armada’s path. 

The casualty reports continued 
without interruption. 

Sector ll’s deep-rangers, de- 
stroyed. 

The cruiser Lambert , crippled. 
Distress calls. Silence. Destroyed. 

Sectors 8 through 10, cleared of 
Fleet vessels. 

The Vegan system, cleared of 
opposition. 

Then the first wave began to 
swarm across the face of Vega IV, 
screaming down the skies, punching 
New Portland into the ground. New 
San Angeles, New Prussia. Scour- 
ing the New Texas subcontinent. 
Shipcomm hissed and was silent. 

The gray eye of Polyphemus 
was starting to cloud over, a 
firestorm- shot cataract of smoke and 
dust raised by a patternless but de- 



vastating bombardment, when TF 
861’s booster ram sent a scream the 
length of the ship. I punched out 
Earth’s coordinates and escaped into 
the underregion of Time and Space. 

Faced with a journey of more 
than twenty light-years’ distance to 
Earth, I resolved to make the best 
of the two months, standard, during 
which I was to be out of phase with 
normal space. I had spent some 
time aboard orbiters above Vega IV 
as part of my VIN basic training. 
But, before the aborted Polyphemus 
assignment, I had never had a mis- 
sion take me off-planet. 

I had some trouble coping with 
protracted confinement aboard TF 
861. 

Type 1 deep-rangers had the same 
range capabilities as vessels of the 
freighter, cruiser and dreadnaught 
classes — near-infinite, theoretically. 
Unfortunately, deep-rangers had 
never been fitted with interstellar 
hops in mind. So there was a suffi- 
cient store of food on TF 861, plus 
other absolute necessities, but there 
was nothing to do. I had no tapes to 
play. I couldn’t pass the hours star- 
ing out into abnormal space, be- 
cause there was nothing at which to 
stare. Once the Fleet officer RNA 
had degraded, I had no borrowed 
memories through which to sift. 

I exercised. 

I thought about the horror from 
nowhere, shattering the Vegan sys- 
tem, pointing out the insignificance 
of the loyalist-versws-separatist 
squabble. It had been a consummate 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 



91 




invalidation of everything I had 
known, fought for, fought against. 

I slept a lot. 

I thought about the several men 
and women who had died by my 
hand, figuratively and, in Glendan 
Beutel’s case, literally, and woke 
from dreams to find myself mum- 
bling apologies to ghosts, I'm sorry, 
/ killed you for nothing, I'm 
sorry . 

When I could no longer sleep, I 
used my training and forced myself 
to surrender consciousness. I wan- 
dered through my own lush interior 
landscape, a realm of mountains, 
rivers, woodlands, blue skies. The 
phoenix’s place without pain, the 
private universe between conscious- 
ness and the funeral pyre. After a 
time, however, I realized that I was 
no longer alone. My old victims 
haunted the forest paths, aimlessly 
zombie- walking through the gloom. 
Strange vessels blackened the skies. 
There was a secret war in progress 
here, too. I caught glimpses of 
Naomi Sizemore, Paula Crist, vari- 
ous VI N, TIN and separatist agents 
I had known or know of on Vega 
IV. Everybody was trying to kill 
everybody else; there was no reason 
or rhyme to any of it. Ultimately, I 
abandoned this newly cluttered 
realm to the ghosts. 

TF 861 phased into normal space 
well outside the orbit of Earth and 
braked for hours, time I spent in the 
deceleration sling with my eyes 
glued to the teleview. Earth was a 
bluish smear of a world. It looked 



very much like Vega IV. I imag- 
ined the invasion armada descend 
ing upon it like locusts and mentally 
rehearsed my warning: We must be 
ready, an incomprehensible force is 
loose in the universe, we must be 
prepared to meet it, to turn it aside. 

A Home-Fleet cruiser called for 
identification. 1 responded with the 
necessary information, was given 
clearance and escorted by two Type 
G deep-rangers to an orbiter above 
Earth. When I had emerged from 
Decontamination, two Network 
Central officers took me to a de- 
briefing room where, once again, I 
gave my name, VIN rank and code, 
a quick explanation of my Fleet 
dress and vehicle, a breathless 
and — at last, without warning, be- 
cause the dam inside me had to give 
way at some point — tearful account 
of the death of Vega IV. A glass 
filled with an amber-colored liquid 
was brought to me, and I gulped it 
between wracking sobs. My vision 
blurred; the drink was drugged. I 
thought I knew why. I looked up 
into the officers’ sympathetic, com- 
passionate faces. You are a brave 
and loyal person, the faces seemed 
to tell me, and you have been 
through a lot. Rest for a moment. 
Rest. 

I woke up on a table. Someone in 
a metal mask was peeling back my 
first fingernail. It was a consum- 
mate invalidation of every- 
thing.

Every nerve in my body sang its 
own song of agony. Lachesis was 
withdrawing the needles, wrenching 
them out of my flesh with angry 
jerks. The Unchangeable had not 
moved. 

I turned my eyes to Clotho’s 
mask. The metallic features seemed 
to sag with fatigue. The Spinner’s 
voice was hoarse. 

“We know for a fact that there is 
a strong separatist movement on 
Vega IV. We know for a fact that 
separatist agents have been infiltrat- 
ing the VIN.” 

“Was,” I croaked. “Were.” 

Clotho ignored the interruption. 
“We know for a fact that separatist 
agents and sympathizers on Earth 
are trying to subvert the authority of 
Terran Network Central. Facts. The 
truth. No armada. There are no 
malign alien beings lurking just be- 
yond the empire’s boundaries. Ar- 
mageddon never came to Vega IV. 
Do you take us for fools? This is 
your last chance .”

“What?” demanded the Spinner, 
the face close to mine. “Speak up! 
Tell us who, how, when. Tell us.” 

“It’s over,” 1 said. “All of that. 
It’s over. Doesn’t matter now. 
Separatists. Loyalists. Not impor- 
tant. Armada changed all that. 
Changed everything.” 

“We’re going to use the 
psychpick on you now.” 

I shut my eyes, afraid at last. Not 
of the psychpick. If I were under 
cover, the psychpick would tear 



apart my false persona, turn my 
brains into so much inert pudding, 
and I would expire in character, a 
credit to VIN training, leaving an 
interrogator no wiser than before. 
As things stood, I would just die. 
Without hope of resurrection, and in 
the knowledge that I had failed to 
convince my tormentors, failed to 
justify my own pain. 

To die that tenth time. That last 
time, for all time. 

It was, I realized abruptly, my 
only hope. 

“I don’t have to submit to this,” 
I said. 

Clotho drew back, obviously star- 
tled, and looked at Lachesis, who 
grunted and shrugged and said, 
“Crumbling. Never mind it, the 
pick will soil it out for us.” 

"No." The word came out of my 
throat in a dry but emphatic huff of 
breath. “I can die any time 1 want. 
I could’ve died a long . long 
time ago. I don’t have to be here. I 
can make myself die.” 

Lachesis laughed softly. “The 
VIN’s phoenix thing. The death- 
trance trick.” 

Clotho nodded and clutched my 
jaw. Velvet fingers dug into my 
cheek. “You’ll die soon enough, 
phoenix. Really die.” 

“My way.” 

“Go into your trance, then. It 
won’t save you.” 

“No trance,” I hissed. “Death. 
Real death. I don’t have to endure 
this. I don’t have to let myself be 
hurt by you. I could have suicided

at any time. I didn’t . because I 
have to make you see that I’m telling 
you the truth.” 

Lachesis threw a switch. Machin- 
ery hummed. The psychpick began 
to bore into my mind. 

“Listen to me,” I begged, and 
then I made myself go down, like a 
stone dropped into the sea, falling 
from the light, falling into the 
blackness below, down to my place 
without pain. Suspended in the 
void, Death and the rock waited for 
me. 

Well, I said, taking my place 
upon the rock. 

It’s all gone now, Death said un- 
necessaily. My work is almost 
done. Your private landscape, your 
causes, ghosts, guilt, all gone now. 
Meaningless. 

I tried, though. I tried. Maybe, 
finally, 1 succeeded. They will 
check their machine when it fails to 
produce any results. Then they’ll 
examine me. No heartbeat, no brain 
waves. No sign of life. Not a 
trance, I told them, but death, 
real death. Maybe they’ll believe 
then. About everything. 

It doesn’t matter anymore. 

Yes, it does. The Earth is at 
stake. It has to be prepared in the 
event that the armada does come. 

Is that important? Death asked. 
Does Earth have any more signifi- 
cance than the causes you served on 
Vega IV? 

I want to believe in something. If 
not the value and importance of 
what I did, what we all did, on 



Vega IV, in the survival of Earth, 
then. 

But, still, it doesn’t matter. 
Whether your suicide convinces 
them or not, you’ll never know. 
You won’t care. 

I shivered. It was cold in the 
darkness . 

What will you do now? Death’s 
voice was low and soothing, the 
voice of a child trying to coax a shy 
pet into an embrace. 

Build my funeral pyre upon this 
rock, I answered, turning to my 
companion. Death held out its hand. 

I started to take it, paused and said, 
A question. 

Yes? 

When everything ceases to be, 
when your work is done . what 
will you do? 

Death smiled but made no reply. 
Our fingertips touched, hands 
clutched, arms entwined. I was 
drawn forward and pressed against a 
bosom softer, more yielding, than a 
bed of the finest powdery dust. 
Flames licked up through the void, 
cold, cold, terribly cold fire engulf- 
ing the phoenix. I started to cry out, 
LM AFRAID. I didn’t live long 
enough. 

I sucked in air. It was painful. It 
surprised me. 

Above me, a single mask, serene 
and sexless. Its golden eyes re- 
garded me intently. I had trouble re- 
turning the gaze. My own eyes kept 
wandering to the light fixture on the 
ceiling. It seemed wrong. Different. 
Different cei ling.

GALAXY 




Different room. 

After a while, I managed to con- 
centrate on the mask. My tongue 
felt numb when I spoke. “Which 
. one?” 

“I don’t understand,” said the 
Fate. 

“Which one are . you? 
Clotho? Lachesis? A-Atropos? 
You’re . Atropos.” 

“Who is Atropos?” 
“Unchangeable. Severer. Of the 
thread. Of life. The one who 
stood ...” My hand fluttered 
weakly, stiffly, the joints making 
known their resentment. “Back 
there. In the back.” 

“Yes.” The Fate nodded. “That 
was me.” 

“I . ” A sob bubbled in the 
back of my throat, tears filled my 
eyes. “You can’t do . I’m sup- 
posed to be dead , I had to die. You 
can’t bring me back. I had to die. 
Have to be dead. My only hope of 
making you believe.” 

“You were dead,” Atropos said 
mildly. “Dolgener and Lette, 
Clotho and Lachesis, if you prefer, 
are fairly representative TIN people. 
They don’t have an especially clear 
idea of VIN methods, capabilities. 
But when they discovered that you 
really had killed yourself, they be- 
lieved. 

“They believed. ...” 

The Unchangeable lifted a shoul- 
der in a half-shrug. “Not com- 
pletely, of course. Enough. Various 
ships are en route to Vega now, in- 
cluding a Fleet dreadnaught which 



is due to phase in there in six days, 
standard. It will take another two 
months for reports to get back to 
Earth. If there’s anything to report. 
Dolgener and Lette are anxious to 
find out.” 

“But they believed me.” 

“They think you may have told 
them the truth, before you died. 
They’ll be waiting for those re- 
ports.” A needle slid into the hol- 
low of my arm. It stung. “If it 
turns out that your deus ex machina 
armada has indeed passed through 
the Vegan system and so forth” — a 
sardonic note crept into Atropos’ 
voice; I didn’t like it — “Network 
Central will then take the necessary 
steps, prepare Earth’s defenses. And 
so forth.” 

“It has to be done now,” I said, 
weakly vehement. “The ships could 
start showing up at any moment. 
Today. They could be on their way 
here now.” 

“Or heading the other way. It 
doesn’t matter. Don’t excite 
yourself.” Another injection. 
“You’re in bad shape.” 

“But you can’t take the chance!” 
“You took one.” 

I started to protest further, but 
something else, something impor- 
tant, occurred to me. “You 
. you brought me back.” 
“Obviously.” 

“How? Why?” 

“The usual way.” 

“But why? Who are you?” 
Atropos gave me yet another in- 
jection. “Go to sleep.” 



PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX

“Who are you?” I raised a hand, 
thinking of snatching off Atropos’ 
mask. Rather: I tried to raise a 
hand. There was a numbness steal- 
ing through my body, cool, healing 
currents swirling about inside my 
skull. My eyelids drooped. I 
couldn’t keep them up. My voice 
sounded dreamy and faraway. “You 
don’t . believe me.” Going, go- 
ing. 

There was sunlight coming 
through the window when I opened 
my eyes. The strange but pleasant 
scent of Terran flowers was in my 
nostrils. The ceiling changed color, 
darkening from stark white to a 
friendly pastel green, the color 
flowing down the walls. The room 
said, “Good day. Have you slept 
well?” 

I didn’t respond. I lay blinking, 
turning my head from side to side 
as much as I could, trying to deter- 
mine where I might be. In a bed- 
room, obviously, with one wide 
window opening onto a terrace. 
Over the terrace’s stone railing, 1 
could see the ghostly purple teeth of 
a distant mountain range. I wanted 
to sit up in bed and get a better 
view. My body twitched but did not 
obey. There was a warm tingly sen- 
sation which I recalled having ex- 
perienced once before, in a regener- 
ation clinic on Vega IV. 

“Where am I?” I asked the 
room. “What date?” 

The room said nothing. A door 
swung inward from the wall oppo- 
site the foot of my bed, and a slim 



gray-haired man entered. He came 
over to me and gave me a warm 
smile. 

“Good day.” He had a blandly 
sincere voice. “Believe it or not, 
we’re actually going to get to look 
at each other on an eye-to-eye level 
one of these days. You’re healing 
nicely.” 

“How long since. ...” 

“The table? Two weeks, three 
days.” 

“So there's no word about Vega 
yet. 

The man laughed. “No, we’re all 
fearfully awaiting the speedy return 
of the dreadnaught Knox. Bearing 
dire tidings of the total destruction 
of the colony.” 

“Atropos.” 1 said. “You’re At- 
ropos.” 

He raised a shoulder; that half- 
shrug again. “And you’re the 
phoenix who wanted to know why I 
brought you back. I’m very sorry 
about that. Not about bringing you 
back, of course. For letting you end 
up on the table. We tried to prevent 
it, but Home-Fleet was howling for 
better explanations, and Network 
Central always listens to Home- 
Fleet first. Whoever planned that 
deep-ranger business is insane. 
Owing to the nature of my affilia- 
tion with TIN, I had to stand by 
and watch as you were taken 
apart.” 

“Who are you, Atropos?” 

“An officer of the Terran Intelli- 
gence Network, of course. And — ” 
he grinned broadly; I could no 



96 



GALAXY 




longer think of this man as Atropos, 
the Unchangeable, not without his 
mask and robes and silence “ — an 
agent of the Vegan Intelligence 
Network. How else would I have 
known what to do in order to bring 
you back?” 

I opened my mouth to speak, but 
there was nothing I could think of 
to say except, / don't understand. 
The question must have been an 
obvious one. 

“We have to keep TIN in line, 
after all. Which means getting as 
many of our people into positions of 
power in both TIN and Network 
Central. We’ve done a pretty good 
job, too. The phoenix thing, for in- 
stance. TIN doesn’t understand it, 
doesn’t believe in it officially. 
Which is why trainees aren't taught 
the fine art of dying.” Another 
laugh. “More of our handiwork. 
TIN is hamstrung every time it turns 
about. Perhaps now you can under- 
stand why TIN interrogators are 
such vicious paranoiacs.” 

“Why?” 

The man blinked. “What do you 
mean?” 

“Why are we — are you doing 
this?” 

He frowned and leaned slightly 
forward at the waist. “I think it’s 
time, well past time, that you ex- 
plained this peculiar mission of 
yours. Why did they send you to 
Earth?” 

“The armada.” 

“The what?” There was a faint 
spray of spittle. “Are you joking?” 

PASSPORT FOR A PHOENIX 






“What’s going on here?” I felt 
sick in the pit of my stomach. 
“What are you doing on Earth? 
Working against the separatists, un- 
dermining TIN, what’re you trying 
to accomplish ?" His cheeks started 
to mottle, my voice started going up 
the scale. “Just what the hell kind 
of mess did I walk into? Whose 
side are you on? How God-damned 
many sides are there?” I was 
screaming now. 1 couldn’t rise from 
the bed, I couldn’t move any part of 
my body below the neck, but I was 
driving him away from the bed, to- 
ward the door, with my shrieks. 
“What difference does any of it 
make? Why aren't you getting ready 
to fight REAL enemies ?" The door 
slammed behind him. The ceiling 
and walls dappled and became a 
somber blue. 

Oh God. Oh God. Calling upon 
an ancient force reputed to have 
been as terrible and implacable as 
the invasion armada. Oh Yahweh, 
Zeus, Wodin. Drawing upon my 
life-long fascination with the ancient 
mythologies for Furies, harpies, 
basilisk, kraken. Fall upon the 
phoenix, tear it, savage it, kill it 
and grind its flesh to meal, its 
bones to powder, and keep these far 
from the fire. Revoke my pass into 
the land of the living. Take me 
away from this place of pain. 

★ ★ ★ 

Later, lying in bed under a warm 
yellow ceiling, looking out the win- 



dow at the distant mountains, my 
fury spent, I consoled myself with 
the knowledge that the report on 
Vega IV, when it came, would 
have much the same effect on these 
Terran intrigues as the sudden ap- 
pearance of the armada had had on 
Vegan domestic problems. Six 
weeks to wait out, then, for surely 
the first vessels to reach the devas- 
tated colony were already coming 
back. 

Six weeks. 

During which, of course, the 
VIN faction operating within the 
walls of TIN could decide to rid it- 
self of me, or TIN, Home-Fleet, 
one or another section of Terran 
Network Central, could learn that I 
was alive again and root me out, or 
the separatists on Earth could take 
an interest in me. 

Or, no more or less likely a pos- 
sibility: the berserkers from 

nowhere could come hurtling 
through the solar system, brushing 
aside the unready Fleet like birds in 
a hurricane, reducing another world 
to ashes, underscoring again, for 
some chance observer other than 
myself, the essential meagreness of 
all human endeavor. 

Deus ex machina . The god popping 
out of his box in an ancient drama 
to do as he pleased with the human 
characters on stage. Anything could 
happen in six weeks. 

If worse came to worst, I knew, I 
had a place in mind where I could 
sit on a nice rock and talk things 
over with an old friend. ★

THAT BEAUTIFUL GOONEY BIRD 



One oe my urst assignments in 
the space business was to work on 
the Boeing proposal for Dyna- 
Soar — a reusable aerospace plane 
that could go to orbit and return. 
DynaSoar and the other space- 
planes never got funded, and instead 
Congress separated military from 
civilian space systems, put space 
with NASA, and opted for disin- 
tegrating totem poles that returned 
about 5 c /c of the structural weight 
launched. 

The totem poles worked. Magni- 
ficently. They were admirable for 
space exploration; but it was always 
obvious that they’d never do for 
space exploitation. Now, after 17 
years of waiting, I’ve seen the ship 
we wanted to build back in the late 
50’s. 

On Friday, 17 September, 1976, we 
watched the roll-out of the first real 



space ship. The Enterprise was the 
star of a show we’d waited for for 
some considerable time. One chap 
standing next to me said something 
to the effect that she was the ugliest 
thing he’d ever seen; I managed real 
self-restraint and said only that it 
depended on your viewpoint. I sup- 
pose that aesthetically the Shuttle is 
a bit ungainly. Her wings are 
stubby, she’s covered over with 
tiles, and she’s built something like 
a Mack truck. In the same sense 
you might say that the Army 6-by is 
ugly: it depends on what you want 
to do with it. 

If the politicians don’t kill her be- 
fore she flies — Fritz Mondale is on 
record as wanting the Shuttle pro- 
gram cancelled — September 17, also 
the anniversary of John Glen’s first 
flight, could be an important day in 
man’s history. The Enterprise and 



100 



GALAXY 



her sister ships will make space op- 
erations routine and give all of us 
access to space. 

The rollout was a low-key event, 
and it was significant that only cer- 
tain people were there. The 
Goldwaters, Senator and Con- 
gressman, of course; Olin Teague, 
our champion in the House of Repre- 
sentatives; Senator Tunney; a host 
of NASA, White House, and indus- 
try officials; the Star Trek bridge 
crew (except for William Shatner 
who was off on location) and Gene 
Roddenberry; my own party, Larry 
Niven and myself, Poul and Karen 
Anderson, and Bjo Trimble; the 
more dedicated of the science press 
corps, although far fewer than I’d 
have expected. Even more signifi- 
cant may have been those not there: 
the Governor of California, nor 
any representative of the “con- 
sumer” or “ecology” movements. 

Now true: rollouts are not really 
such significant events, and since 
the rise of so-called “economy” 
advocates the industries and NASA 
no longer throw the truly elegant 
roll-out parties that were once tradi- 
tional. There weren’t many science 
fiction writers simply because 
NASA didn’t invite them: when, a 
few days before rollout was 
scheduled 1 realized none of us had 
received invitations, I called North 
American Rockwell’s Earl Blount 
and got things set up for Larry and 
the Andersons, and suggested 
Rockwell invite Mrs. Trimble on 
the theory that anyone who can get 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



a ship’s name changed probably 
ought to get to watch it roll out; but 
NASA had thought either (1) sci- 
ence fiction writers wouldn’t be in- 
terested in seeing what they’ve been 
writing about come to pass, or (2) 
we aren’t important enough to be 
asked. I’m sure, though, that Gov- 
ernor Brown knew about the Shut- 
tle, and it seems significant that not 
one representative of the “Appro- 
priate Technology” movement of 
which he is a major spokesman 
bothered to show up. In fact, given 
Fritz Mondale’s determined opposi- 
tion to the Shuttle, it’s downright 
frightening. 

We’re so close. If it survives the 
political onslaught, the Shuttle will 
put 65,000 pounds in near-Earth 
orbit for a cost of between $10 and 
$20 million per mission. The cost 
spread has to do with accounting: 
how much of the R&D cost must be 
charged to each mission? The mar- 
ginal cost — that is, the out-of- 
pocket cost — of each mission is just 
under $10 million, and with practice 
that can probably be reduced. At 
the moment the turn-around time 
from re-entry to next mission is 
planned at 160 hours; but a great 
deal of that is checkout and elabo- 
rate tests, and if the ships fly as 
well as we think they will, it can be 
cut. 

The Shuttle is to the disintegrat- 
ing totem poles as the DC-3 was to 
the Spirit of St. Louis. The first 
Shuttle was supposed to have been 
named Constitution , and in fact that 



101 




name had already been painted on 
when, in an election year, the Star 
Trek fans generated some 100,000 
letters and got it changed to Enter- 
prise: but a good case can be made 
that the most appropriate name 
would have been “Gooney Bird.” 
The old DC-3, the Goon, 
Methuselah with Wings, instantly 
turned flying from a stunt to a pro- 
fitable business; and it’s likely the 
Shuttle will do the same for space. 

In fact, there’s talk of a “news- 
people mission” in the early 
1980’s. I wonder who’ll go: those 
few of us who have, year after 
year, plugged for space exploration, 
or the sudden enthusiasts who show 
up only when there’s a big spec- 
tacular? Given NASA’s past per- 
formance, 1 think 1 know — they 
haven’t been notable for saving 
spots in the press stands for science 
fiction people. You’d think there’d 
be some gratitude for those who’ve 
spent their lives keeping up interest 
in space and haven’t forgotten its 
importance during the dry years 
when there are no spectaculars. 

I’d like to stake my own claim to 
a seat. Chances are that at least one 
of the people who will in future 
have the responsibility for making 
up that passenger list is right now a 
Galaxy reader. Keep me in mind, 
will you? 

The Shuttle is the first true space- 
ship. It wasn’t designed to do any 
particular thing: it merely carries 
people and equipment to space. The 
important thing is that it gives space 



access to nearly anything and any- 
one who has business there. It can 
be used to capture and repair old 
satellites, take up whole strings of 
new ones — or build a real space sta- 
tion, something that SKYLAB 
never was. 

Now there’s a move on the part 
of the L-5 Society and other groups 
to “rescue” the abandoned 
SKYLAB. It’s unlikely to succeed. 
The first orbital shuttle flights don’t 
happen until just about the deadline 
for kicking SKYLAB back upstairs, 
and some tricky work would be in- 
volved. 

It might not be worth the effort. 
True, there is some usable equip- 
ment aboard SKYLAB, but the first 
“house in space” was never de- 
signed to be reusable. There are no 
facilities for refilling SKYLAB’s 
oxygen and water tanks. The ship 
was put together from old Apollo 
parts after Congress decided not to 
continue the Apollo follow-on pro- 
gram; indeed, SKYLAB was more 
an administrator’s than an en- 
gineer’s triumph, in that it was con- 
ceived and carried out as a plan to 
diddle Congress out of funds that 
wouldn’t otherwise have been forth- 
coming. 

(“You don’t want to waste all 
that equipment, do you? When for a 
little more we can. .”) 

Now very clever design could 
probably make use of the poor old 
bird again by sending up tools and 
space riggers for rebuilding it; but, 
sad to say, it would probably be 



102 



GALAXY 




cheaper to build a true space station 
from scratch. Welding tankage 
valves, repairing the guidance and 
control system — these had already 
begun to fail before the SKYLAB 
four crew left — is hard work in 
space. It takes a long time, and 
some of that would have to be done 
before the tumbling laboratory could 
be kicked up to a higher orbit. 

★ ★ ★ 

And having said all that, 1 wish 
they’d try. Call it sentiment, or the 
“Waste not, want not’’ philosophy 
of many of us from back in the 
days when we pirated space re- 
search from other programs; but it 
seems a shame that a vehicle that 
once supported three men for 84 
days can’t be used for something. 

There will come a time when that 
hardware would be very useful. 
There’s about 170,000 pounds of 
SKYLAB in orbit up there, and that 
comes to 2.6 Shuttle flights just to 
get the equivalent mass upstairs: 
over $30 million in flight costs, 
without mentioning the replacement 
cost, Earthside, of the gear. 

SKYLAB started in a nearly cir- 
cular orbit some 435 kilometers 
above the Earth. By the time of the 
first Shuttle Bights it will be down 
to 200 kilometers or so. The cost of 
boosting it back up into a stable or- 
bit, say 1000 kilometers, is in the 
order of .5 kilometers/second veloc- 
ity change. 

If we use a rather dumb chemical 
rocket for the job, we can accom- 



plish the task with about 31,000 
pounds of fuel; add another 5,000 
pounds of structure for the dumb 
rocket, and add 2000 pounds of 
guidance equipment (no point in 
being subtle about it); we’ll still 
have 26,000 pounds left over from 
a Shuttle payload, more than 
enough to store consumables aboard 
SKYLAB, add welding equipment 
and other gear, fill her with new in- 
struments and film. 

Couldn’t three astronauts trained 
for the job refurbish SKYLAB? I’d 
strongly bet they could for a total 
mission cost of under $100 million, 
and that includes equipment built 
here on the ground, $20 million for 
the Shuttle flight, and crew training 
costs to boot. 

Out of that we’d get an im- 
mediately habitable space lab. Not a 
true space station, true, but one 
heck of a useful space platform that 
could house an experimental crew, 
serve as living quarters for scientists 
with mission plans calling for ex- 
tended stay in space, and even as an 
emergency shelter — not to mention 
being living quarters for the con- 
struction gang when we do decide 
to build a real space station. 

Rescuing the old girl would be a 
risky mission, and I’ve made it 
seem a bit simple here. Actually, 
the astronauts would have to 
rendezvous with the tumbling 
SKYLAB; get something attached 
that would let them stabilize it; 
winch over the booster rocket and 
emergency guidance system; fire 

103 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 




this mess at the right time; and, 
when the proper altitude was 
reached, turn SKYLAB in the right 
direction and fire off another rocket 
(or relight the one they used for 
new orbit injection). Once that was 
done, the work of refurbishing 
could start. 

★ ★ ★ 

Ever since I began this column 
Eve had letters asking for an inter- 
mediate lesson in orbital mechanics: 
how do you find out the velocity 
changes needed to get from Earth to 
orbit, or from orbit to orbit? How 
can you tell what mass ratios are 
needed? How the devil (someone is 
saying right now) did you get those 
numbers for SKYLAB rescue? 

1 haven’t done it because it’s not 
really appropriate for this column; 
my intent in A STEP FARTHER 
OUT is to stay far-out, not write a 
textbook on what’s known. Every 
month there’s another book pub- 
lished on space and space travel, 
and, I’ve said to myself, surely one 
of those is going to do my job for 
me; I’ll only have to give the refer- 
ence. 

After nearly three years I give 
up. In all those books there’s not 
one — at least not one that I know 
of — that conveniently gives the 
basic math needed to let a cal- 
culator-possessing intelligent citi- 
zen go through an elementary mis- 
sion analysis; and that’s criminal. 
Th e calculations are not that 



esoteric. Some of the numbers are 
messy, but a decent pocket com- 
puter will handle messy numbers as 
easily as simple ones. Thus, I’m 
about to sneak in some basic 
space- math. 

For those of you who can’t stand 
equations, don’t go away; I’ll come 
back to saving the SKYLAB and 
other space missions before I’m 
done. 

The best measure of mission cost 
is velocity change, called “delta- 
vee” and often written A v. (“Del- 
ta” here stands for the expression 
“a change in.”) Delta-v is useful 
because it doesn’t much matter 
when or how you use it: a ship has 
so much velocity-change capability, 
and whether the pilot uses it all at 
once, or in little bits and spurts, the 
total remains the same. Of equal im- 
portance, missions can be planned 
around delta-v requirements, and 
those can be calculated right here 
on the ground. Thus the two most 
important calculations in space mis- 
sion planning are, how much 
delta-v will the job take, and how 
much has my ship got? Given those 
numbers, you’re in the right 
ballpark; add a safety factor and 
you’ve got a good handle on mis- 
sion costs. 

We’ve been through the equations 
for the ship delta-v, but it’s con- 
venient to introduce the subject by 
going through them again; besides, 
not all of you have been reading 
this column from the beginning. 

The basic equation in rocketry is: 



104 



GALAXY 




Delta-v = 

(v e )ln(— ) (equation one) 
\m v / 

where delta-v is the total velocity 
change, v e is the velocity of the 
exhaust gas coming out the back 
end of the rocket ship (assuming 
you’re directing the gas straight 
backwards, which you’ll try very hard 
to do), and the next expression is 
the natural log of the ratio of the 
mass before you started the mission 
(m 0 ) and the mass you have left 
when you achieve your final veloc- 
ity (m v ). Most scientific calculators 
have an “Ln” button. 

Now what good does that do 
you? Quite a lot, actually. It’s not 
hard to find the exhaust velocities 
of various kinds of ships. First we 
need another equation. 

v e = I Sp x g (equation two) 

where I sp is specific impulse, a 
measure of fuel/system efficiency (it 
is usually measured in pounds of 
thrust/pound fuel/second, cancelling 
into “seconds”; but don’t confuse 
I sp with a time , because it’s not). 
The g in that equation is the surface 
gravity of Earth, 980 centimers/ 
second 2 ; but the equation works 
anywhere in the universe. I sp will 
gradually be phased out now that 
missions get completely free of 
Earth’s gravity field, but it’s still a 
conveniently acquired measure — it 
can be taken directly from a 
tethered engine on a test stand right 
here on Earth. 



I sp for various fuels and other 
drive systems are given in Table 
One. 

Sometimes it’s convenient to 
transform equation one so that we 
can find the mass ratio given the 
required delta-v; 

m Q _ / delta-v 
m v ” \ v e 

e (oli) (equalion three > 

where the terms are as defined be- 
fore. To get e to some power on my 
calculator you punch “Inverse” and 
“In.” 

The quantity e = 2.71828 is a 
constant that pops up in many 
strange places. 

With those three equations and 
some work you can find out nearly 
everything you need to know about 
space missions. Obviously the fuel 
weight you need, 

m f U ei = m o - m v (equation four) 

is simple enough to discover. I’ll 
give one more equation just to be 
complete, but most of you will 
never need it. The Thrust, (T) of 
the system depends on the rate of 
mass loss (the faster you burn it, 
the more the thrust): 

T = m ° ^ - x v e (equation five) 

and the only new term here is 
time, t. Note well: in the foot- 
pound system, thrust is expressed in 




A STEP FARTHER OUT 



105 




Ya 




“pounds” and sounds like a weight; 
it isn’t, it’s a force, such that one 
pound of thrust will support one 
pound of weight in a one gravity 
field; don’t get confused. Alterna- 
tively, a pound of thrust will accel- 
erate one pound of mass at one g if 
the mass starts in orbit. 

Having done with the ship delta-v 
calculations, we’ll move on to mis- 
sion requirements. For those still 
confused, don’t despair: I’ll work 
out a couple of examples for you 
after we’ve finished with all the 
equations. 



mechanics is that you’re orbiting 
something, and by definition that 
something has mass; it generates a 
gravity field. 

Thus we have to start with the 
mass of the central object. From 
that we can find the acceleration 
that an object would experience at 
some distance from our central 
mass, 



a = 



GM 



(equation six) 



where a is the acceleration, M is 
the mass of the central object, r is 
the distance of object from center of 
the attracting mass, and G is the 
universal constant of gravitation. 
Since I grew up with centimeters, 
grams, and seconds, I’ll use those 
units here and convert to other units 
when convenient; and in the cgs 
system, G = 6.67 x 10“ 8 . 

Actually, we almost never bother 
with GM in orbital equations be- 
cause they’re always together; in- 
stead we define 



K = GM (equation seven) 

and recall that while G doesn’t 
change, M and K will: K isn’t the 
same when calculating flights from 
Earth to Mars as it is in figuring out 
Earth orbit missions. 

Now the most efficient and 
simplest orbit is circular, and the 
velocity of a satellite is

but it’s sometimes convenient (es- 
pecially if you have a calculator 
with addressable memories) to de- 
fine r as the radius of our central 
body (Earth, say) and y t . as the 
height of our satellites above Earth; 
then we get 



v c = l/7 \ (equation nine). 

y ( r oo + y c ) 

If you plug numbers into those 
equations (for those who don’t have 
Dole’s Habitable Planets for Man or 
some other convenient data source, 
Earth masses 5.977 x 10 27 grams 
and has a radius of 6.371 x 10“ cen- 
timeters, giving K earth = 3.987 x 
10 20 ) you’ll find that the farther out 
from Earth you go, the slower your 
ship is moving: which ought to be 
obvious, if you think about it. Yet 
we know that it takes more delta-v to 
get to a high orbit than to a low 
one. 

That one is a bit messier. What 
we have to find is the “energy vel- 
ocity,’’ V E , for the orbit we want; 
that’s also our theoretical delta-v. In 
the real world where there’s air re- 
sistance and our ships can’t fly 
exactly on the paths we want, it 
takes a bit more; that’s where we 
plug in safety factors. The equa- 
tion for the theoretical delta-v is, 




108 



which looks messy but is actually 
easy enough to calculate. Using my 
programmable SR-52 I’ve run off a 
few numbers for you in Table Two. 

So far so good, but how do we 
find out what it takes to get from 
one orbit to another? Well, we 
could take the difference between 
the velocities we get from running 
equation ten for the two orbit al- 
titudes; but that gives us something 
so theoretical it’s useless. 

Better to think how we can get 
from one orbit to another. Consider 
Figure One. We have a low parking 
orbit, and we want to get to a 
higher one; say we’re got SKYLAB 
in the lowest one and we want to 
knock it up much higher. 

First we boost like mad at the 
point marked r p , which will 
shove our rocket into an elliptical 
orbit; if we’ve chosen our thrust 
correctly the top of the ellipse, 
known as apo-apsis or r A ,will just 
touch the altitude we’d like to have 
for a new circular orbit. A word 
about those symbols: r P stands for 
“radius of peri-apsis,’’ or the dis- 
tance at which we’re closest to the 
times use “perigee’’ and “apogee’’ 
furthest distance. Older books some- 
times use “perigee’’ and apogee’’ 
for closest and furthest from Earth; 
perhelion and apohelion for closest 
and furthest from the Sun; perias- 
tron and apoastron where astron 
means star. 

The main thing to remember is 
“a’’ for “away from.’’ 

Now we’ve kicked our rocket 

GALAXY 




into an elliptical orbit that gets out 
to the right distance, but unfortu- 
nately as soon as it gets there it 
tries to fall right back down again; 
it’s going to stay in an elliptical 
orbit until we do something about 
it. What we do is give it a kick in 
the apogee; when we’ve got to the 
maximum altitude, we light off our 
rocket again to increase the velocity 
to that required for a circular orbit 
at the given altitude. You can calcu- 
late the required velocity from equa- 
tion nine, stuffing r A in as r c ; you 
can find out what velocity you 
started with down in the parking or- 
bit, also from equation nine, this 
time using r P . We don’t have our 
required delta-v for the mission yet, 
but we’ve made a pretty good start 
on it. 

Alas, the next step is the messiest 
one. It isn’t hard; just simple 
algebra, plugging the numbers into 
the equation; but it looks simply 
awful. What we need are two vel- 
ocities, v P which is the velocity at 
peri-apsis, and v A , the velocity at 
apo-apsis, for a given elliptical or- 
bit. 




(equation eleven) 

where v P is the path velocity of the 
rocket at periapsis, r P is the distance 
from the center of the central mass, 
and n is the ratio of the two dis- 
tances, 



yi 

n = — (equation twelve). 

r p 



(equation thirteen) 

so that wasn’t so bad. It should be 
obvious that v P = v A x n and I 
won’t even bother to number that 
one. 

We are now ready to do the 
SKYLAB rescue calculations. Re- 
member I started with SKYLAB in 
an orbit 200 km above Earth. A 
kilometer, by the way, is 10 5 cen- 
timeters. 

1 start off using equation nine, 
adding the orbit height to the 
Earth’s radius, dividing that into K, 
and taking the square root to come 
out with 7.79 km/second, the speed 
at which SKYLAB will be travel- 
ling when we reach her. We want 
to kick her up to 1000 km., so 1 use 
equation nine to find that we’ll 
eventually be going 7.35 km/sec. 

Now 1 use equation eleven and 
find V P for my transfer ellipse is 
8.0095 km/second; subtracting out 
the 7.79 I’m already moving I find 
1 have to kick it .219 km/sec to get 
the required velocity to put it into 
elliptical orbit that reaches 1000 
km. Using equation thirteen 1 find 
that when 1 get to my 1000 km al- 
titude I’ll be moving 7.14 km/sec, 
while 1 want to be going 7.35; thus 
I’ve got to kick it in the apogee 
with .21 km/second. My two veloc- 
ity changes can be added together to 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



109 




get the total mission delta-v, which 
is .429 km/sec. 

Since nothing ever goes exactly 
right, 1 round upward to .5 km/sec 
as required delta-v and go looking 
for something to do it with. RP-1 
and LOX (high-powered kerosene 
and liquid oxygen in vacuum) give 
a specific impulse of 300, which is 
what I used in my calculations; plug 
that into equation three, and out 
comes a mass ratio of 1.18, and .18 
times the 170,000 lb mass of 
SKYLAB gives me 31,000 pounds 
of fuel needed for the rescue mis- 
sion. I should now do some refine- 
ments, adding the 5,000 pounds of 
structure and 2,000 pounds of gui- 
dance to the 170,000 lbs of 
SKYLAB; decide whether I really 
want to take up a liquid rocket with 
the pumps and liquified oxygen and 
attendent problems, or drop my I sp 
down to maybe 250 and use a solid. 
It doesn’t matter, because I can still 
see I can accomplish my SKYLAB 
rescue with one Shuttle payload, 
and I’m not trying for more accu- 
rate results. 

Obviously these equations will 
work for deep-space missions as 
well as Earth orbit. To use them 
for, say. Earth to Mars, you do 
exactly what we did here: assume 
Earth and Mars are in circular orbits 
around the Sun; plug in the solar 
mass (1.991 x 10 33 grams) to calcu- 
late K; get your Earth and Mars dis- 
tances in centimeters; and go. How- 
ever, you have one advantage if you 
begin in Earth orbit: you can sub- 



tract out the ship’s orbital velocity 
relative to Earth from the required 
injection delta-v. Remember that 
you’re calculating everything rela- 
tive to the Sun except for that: 
when you find the initial velocity of 
your satellite it’s the Earth' s orbital 
velocity (29.7 km/second) that you 
start with (plus the ship’s velocity 
around Earth) and Mars’s orbital 
velocity that you’ve got to end up 
with. Mars will help you catch up if 
all you want to do is get into Mars 
orbit; I’ll leave that for you to cal- 
culate. 

One more equation and we’re 
done. We need to find out how long 
the mission takes. That’s not too 
important for near-Earth operations, 
but for Earth-Mars or Earth-Ceres 
runs it can be critical. 



T = ^ (equation fourteen) 

where T is the period of our ellipti- 
cal (or circular, for that matter) or- 
bit, and a is the semi-major axis of 
the ellipse. All that means is the 
distance from the center of the el- 
lipse to the point farthest away from 
it, which you find by 

a = (equation fifteen). 

In the units we’re working with the 
time will come out in seconds: di- 
vide by 2 to get the mission Bight 
time since we’re only flying half the 
ellipse. 



110 



GALAXY 




Incidentally, what we’re calculat- 
ing here are the famous Hohmann 
Transfer Orbits mentioned so prom- 
inently in Willy Ley’s books on 
rocketry and space travel, and the 
equations I’ve given you are the 
very ones that Hohmann used some 
fifty years ago. You can’t fly a 
Hohmann ellipse just any time you 
want to: you’ve got to wait until the 
geometry’s right. Specifically, you 
have to leave at a time such that 
when you arrive, your target will be 
exactly opposite the point you 
started from. 

Hohmann orbits are the minimum 
delta-v flight paths; there are other 
ways to get from one planet to 
another if you’re in a hurry. They 
cost more fuel (delta-v requirements 
go up) and their energy require- 
ments are hairier to work with. I’d 
give you the equations except that 1 
know Jim Baen is already gnashing 
his teeth, the printer is saying po- 
tent words of evil magic directed at 
this yo-yo who makes him set all 
this in type (and sir, 1 do appreciate 
the work!), and at least one of my 
readers has sworn to commit suicide 
if I give one more equation. 

And yet. Having made the cus- 
tomary apology for working my 
readers a bit, I wonder if I should? 
Doggone it, none of this is all that 
hard, and we do live in an age of 
space travel; surely it’s worthwhile 
to know the bare minimum about 
space operations? 

Must everything be left to ex- 
perts? Surely science fiction readers 



can stand some intermediate math? 

Anyway, I’ve given you the basic 
tools, and pocket computers that 
can handle logs and exponential no- 
tation cost around $40: with this in- 
troduction those interested can go to 
more advanced works. The trouble 
is that most books insist on using 
vector notation and calculus, and 
while 1 agree those tools make it all 
simpler if you know them, you’d 
think somebody would let out the 
secret that ordinary algebra will do 
the job close enough. Have fun. 

Unfortunately I’ve run out of 
space and we still haven’t rescued 
SKYLAB. Should we or shouldn’t 
we? 1 just don’t know. The numbers 
say we can do it at reasonable 
costs — about one Shuttle mission, 
plus the ground engineering, crew 
training, and some hardware to 
carry up. The only really complex 
part of the mission is stabilizing the 
SKYLAB to begin with: it will be 
tumbling, and you can’t very well 
dock with a tumbling object. 

There’s where man-in-space gets 
valuable. 1 see no real reason why it 
can’t be done this way. 

Rendezvous with SKYLAB and 
take station not too far away. An 
astronaut with a self-contained EVA 
suit uses a reaction pistol to get 
over to the SKYLAB and grabs 
hold. It’s easy to calculate the cen- 
trifugal forces he’ll experience (no 
Jim, 1 won’t do it to you: let them 
look in a high school physics book) 
and they’re not excessive. If he 
carries a line and a winch he could 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



111 




haul a package containing a small 
rocket and some computer equip- 
ment over, bolt that onto the tum- 
bling spacecraft, and let fly; it 
wouldn’t take a lot of reaction force 
to stabilize the ship. 

Once she’s stable, winch over the 
booster package and attach; there’s 
a docking port already. 

Could we do it? Of course. Will 
we? Probably not. It’s a dangerous 
mission. But surely we’ve no short- 
age of courage among the astronaut 
corps? No. For that matter, I’d 
wager reasonable sums 1 could get 
20 qualified volunteers from among 
Galaxy readers who’d do it for 
room and board and the chance to 
get into space. The question is, do 
the politicians who control the 



purse strings have the courage to try 
it? Or the administrators who con- 
trol the Shuttle missions have the 
courage to ask ? And 1 fear 1 know 
the answer to that already. 

It’s a pity. It would make a 
darned good science fiction story, 
and one that could so very easily 
come true; but those things don’t 
happen in the real world. Star Trek 
fans managed to rename the Enter- 
prise , but all that took was a bucket 
of paint. Saving SKYLAB is 
another beast of a different hue. 

Oh well. At least I’ve seen the 
Enterprise roll out, and 1 don’t 
think there was a dry eye in 
Palmdale that marvelous September 
morning. Stubby wings or not — 
she’s beautiful . ★

She seemed suspended in a sea of 
sound, calliope music and trumpet- 
ing barkers, human shrieking and 
mechanical screeching. Ahead 
peopled buckets twisted and tum- 
bled about gigantic steel supports. 
A thrilltaxi dashed from the 
whirlpool, jousting with space. 
“Ev-ry-bod-dy wins.” 

A fat man sat in a trailer cradling 
a microphone in his hands, his 
gold-painted fingertips glistening in 
the sunlight. 

“Play ’til ya win.” 

Air rifles pointed toward targets 
and treasures displayed behind him. 
“Try your luck?” 

Windy backed away, away from 
her mother’s trophy case where 
metals and plaques symbolic of the 
greatest prizes a scientist could hope 
to win shared eminence with the 
loving cups of a master bridge 
player. She turned and ran. 

Ghosts of light danced in a 
suggestion screen. Serpents of the 
Medusa test frolicked in air. A 
rocket soared upward. She tripped 
over a power cable, the umbilical of 
a ferris wheel, and fell sprawling. 

From where she lay, a path, beads 
of wet dust, drew her eyes to a 
stained paper cup covered with ants. 
A long shadow drifted over it. 

“Are you all right?” 

Blushing she struggled to her feet 
and held out her hands, examining 
them. A white handkerchief began 
sponging at the dirt and blood. She 
looked up at the young man before 
her and frowned. “You’re one of 

116 



Mother’s students, aren’t you?” 

“I was. Well, actually I still am, 
in a way. I finished my dissertation 
in May, but she’s letting me stay on 
to complete some experiments be- 
fore I move on to Cal Tech.” He 
examined the scratches. “We need 
soap and water.” 

“Forget it.’’ She pulled free. 
Blowing on her palms as if to cool 
the sting, she walked away. 

It took him two long strides to 
catch up with her. “You shouldn’t 
have come here alone,” he said as 
he stuffed his handkerchief into his 
pocket. 

“Why?” 

“Over there.” He thumbed to- 
ward a man bobbing a toothpick on 
his lips. He was leaning against a 
pitch-penny booth and his lazy eyes 
were fixed on her. “He’s been fol- 
lowing you.” 

“How do you know?” She 
stopped to confront him. “Have 
you been following me too?” 

“Yes,” he admitted with a 
shrug. “I thought I recognized you, 
but you’ve changed a lot since you 
stopped coming to the lab. How 
long has it been?” 

“A couple of years, I suppose. 
Say, did my mother put you up to 
this?” 

“No, I just happen to like carni- 
vals, that’s all. Want to take a ride 
through the egomaze?” 

She shook her head. “Do you 
suppose Mother has hired him to 
follow me?” 

“I doubt it. He looks like he’s 

GALAXY 




out for a pickup and has you spot- 
ted. You’ve grown into quite an at- 
tractive young woman, you know.” 
“Sure.” Looking past him she 
watched an old man at a refresh- 
ment stand bathe his index finger in 
the acetate wash beside a 
computer- register. 

“Anyway, why would your 
mother want you tailed?” 

“Let’s just say that she doesn’t 
approve of my being here either. 
I’m thirsty. I could use a coke.” 
“My treat,” he said grinning, 
pleased with himself that he had 
enough credit to share with her. 
Most guys ate up their rations and 
complained of being starved by the 
government, but he would never 
interrupt an experiment just to eat. 

Windy gazed at his receding back 
for a moment, then stepped in front 
of a trio of boys dressed in band 
uniforms. She led the small parade 
down the midway, executing a col- 
umn right at a cabless semi, halting 
at the computer terminal. 

★ ★ ★ 

Hesitating, she studied the 
scratches on her hands. A moment 
later she turned her head to one 
side, away from the vinegary odor, 
and put her index finger in the 
swirling wash. A flip of her hand 
removed the excess solution. She 
placed her finger in the groove on 
the faceplate and waited while the 
carnivorous register took its micro- 
scopic bite of half-dead skin. With a 



wink and a nod the barker signaled 
that her credit had been approved. 

Without looking back she stepped 
up into the trailer, ducking behind a 
burlap curtain. There were only a 
few spectators. She followed their 
clockwise procession, by-passing the 
six-legged goat. 

Ape Woman was taking a siesta 
in her cave, her silky hair combed 
into waves about her bikini. Windy 
chuckled as she recalled a hairless 
chimpanzee she had seen once. He 
had resembled a man about as much 
as this woman, with her aquiline 
nose and full lips, did an ape. 

The sightseers were watching 
Rubber Man’s self-sculptures. 
Windy circled around them. 

She called into the next stall. 

A grotesque face turned toward 
her, its button eyes brightening. 
“Haw,” Elephant Woman said. 

“How are you?” 

“Fon,” she trumpeted. “Maw 
back’s moosh bottor.” 

“I’m glad.” Hesitating, Windy 
glanced at the pretzel shape of Rub- 
ber Man, then asked, “Would it of- 
fend you if I told you what you re- 
mind me of?” 

Elephant Woman frowned, pro- 
ducing thick folds in her brow, then 
nodded her head, nose flapping. 

“It’s a strange association real- 
ly,” Windy said bracing her arms 
on the railing that kept the freaks 
out of reach. She leaned into the 
jungle. “But you remind me of 
Capuchin. Capuchin was a cocker 
spaniel.” 



NIGHT RUNNERS

The frown disappeared from 
Elephant Woman’s face and Windy 
was encouraged to go on, “He had 
huge paws, small pointed ears, and 
the most beautiful, sad brown eyes, 
and he was sort of accident prone. 
You see, Capuchin had a prehensile 
tail, the kind some New World mon- 
keys have. 

“I’ll never forget the time we 
were leaving for the Duplicate 
Club. It was raining, so Mother had 
called a cab. To appreciate this you 
have to know my mother. She looks 
exactly like I do, only older,' more 
sophisticated.” Windy straightened, 
imitating her mother’s haughty de- 
meanor. 

“Well, we were on our way to 
the cab when I decided I needed a 
raincoat. The umbrella just wasn’t 
large enough for both of us. I ran 
back to the house, swung the door 
open, and Capuchin dashed out be- 
tween my legs. I don’t know how I 
managed to escape, but my mother 
wasn’t as lucky. Capuchin charged 
past her, his tail catching her ankle 
as he went by. It was a classic prat- 
fall, right into a mud puddle. The 
look on her face,” Windy giggled, 
“I’ll never forget it.” 

Elephant Woman laughed as 
much at Windy as at her story. It 
sounded like a pig oinking. 

“You had to see it to appreciate 
it.” 

“I’ll bit.” 

Windy turned toward the source 
of the new voice. Seal Man had 
stretched his neck around the parti - 

118 



tion that separated his rocky ledge 
from the rubber tree jungle. “ Buon 
giorno, Mr. Anatoli,” Windy said, 
losing her smile. 

“ Buon giorno. I can jest sees zat 
dog.” 

“He was my best friend.” She 
moved on quickly. It made her ill to 
look at him, and she did not want 
him to see her face. 

“Turtle Man,” fche exclaimed as 
she peered down into the last com- 
partment. 

“Windy!” Turtle Man had to 
strain his neck to look up at her 
while his grassy platform elevated. 
“When I heard your voice, it was 
like a charivari for my ears.” 
“What’s a charivari?” 

“A si lly song. Comes from 
Greek word for headache.” 

Windy stuck out her lower lip 
pretending to pout. The hoist 
stopped grinding when Windy and 
Turtle Man were face to face. 

“Where have you been, Windy? 
I’ve been expecting you all week.” 
“Working. I’m out of school 
now and doing my stint in the 
Youth Services Corps.” 

“Aha, and they rob you of the 
best years of your life.” 

“That’s a matter of opinion. I 
happen to enjoy doing something 
useful. Say, what happened to 
Backwards Man? At first I thought 
you were gone when I saw Ape 
Woman in your cage, but it’s 
Backwards Man I’m missing.” 

“He joined a circus. Better pay, 
you know. I talked Minsky into this 



GALAXY 




cove so that I could be nearer the 
door and fresh air.” He turned up 
his nose and sniffed. 

Windy nodded toward Seal Man. 
‘‘How is he doing?” 

Turtle Man arched his back in a 
shrug. ‘‘The adjustments are many, 
especially for a man who has spent 
so many years in institutions. He’s 
coming around.” 

Windy turned away, away from 
that strong masculine face. ‘‘It’s not 
fair.” 

‘‘What’s not fair?” 

‘‘Man-made freaks. He doesn’t 
belong here.” 

‘‘Neither do I.” Windy looked 
back into his blue eyes. ‘‘Freaks are 
mistakes, nature’s or man’s. It 
doesn’t make any difference. His 
mother took thalidomide. Mine car- 
ried bad genes and knew that she 
did. Yet she took the chance any- 
way.” 

He paused to study her eyes. 
‘‘Windy, you have the wrong 
perspective. Look at it this way. 
There are no thalidomide freaks 
being bom now. Soon there will be 
no genetic nor congenital freaks 
either because of science. Why, 
over ninety percent of the defective 
fetuses are being aborted now. I ask 
you what is all this going to do to 
the carnival freak business?” 

“I’ll tell you what science is 
doing to the freak business,” she 
said in a harsh whisper. “Science is 
creating new freaks, and my mother 
is the trend setter.” 

“Windy, you . .” 



“I’ll show you one of those 
freaks right now.” She pounded her 
chest with her index finger. “I 
don’t have a father. My mother is 
as virgin as the day she was bom. 
She created me on a petri plate and 
had the embryo implanted in one of 
her lab technicians.” 

“Windy,” he said softly, refus- 
ing to be caught up in her emotions. 
“Windy, we are all freaks. Look at 
those marks over there. See the man 
killing himself with his cigarettes. 
Those are tobacco cigarettes. Look 
at the blonde. That’s a wig. What’s 
she hiding? Look at them. Windy. 
Look at them looking at us. They 
are all freaks.” 

The corner of Windy’s mouth 
twitched a moment before coming 
to rest in a feeble smile. “Is there 
any room in there for me?” 

“That’s my girl.” 

Windy stepped back to let the on- 
lookers gape at Turtle Man. The 
blonde glanced at her, and she 
blushed at the thought of having 
been overheard. As the group dis- 
persed she approached the stall 
again. 

“Freaks. They’re all freaks,” 
Turtle Man scowled. 

“What happened?” 

“Nothing. Nothing, just tongues 
without tact. Can you come by after 
the show closes. I picked up some 
interesting tapes in Guatemala. 
They’ve got an unusual syncopa- 
tion. We could make it a party like 
last year.” He nodded toward the 
other compartments.

“I can’t. I’m supposed to play in 
a bridge tournament tonight. Be- 
sides dancing with Rubber Man is 
like dancing with a suggestion 
screen. The instant you see it, it’s 
gone.” 

Turtle Man laughed. “I see your 
point. Tomorrow then? I could have 
Minsky set up a recorder in here.” 

“Fridays are reserved for the 
psychologists. Uh, when are you 
leaving?” 

“Midnight tomorrow. Got to get 
set up for the State Fair Saturday.” 

“I can’t promise anything.” She 
bit at her lip and then turned toward 
the exit. 

“Windy.” She stopped at his 
call, but did not look back. 
“Thanks for coming. It’s people 
like you who make this job beara- 
ble.” 

★ ★ ★ 

She stepped into the confusion of 
sunlight and noise and felt a surge 
of panic. She closed her eyes to 
ward off the feeling as much as the 
light. 

“What took you so long? The ice 
has melted.” 

Windy squinted up at the man’s 
narrow features. “How did you 
know where I was?” 

He pointed with a paper cup to- 
ward a man clenching a toothpick 
between his teeth. He was braced 
against a barker’s podium. “I asked 
him.” 

“Who is he?” 

120 



“He didn’t say.” He offered her 
the cup. 

She took a sip of the hot syrup, 
then gulped the rest. Crushing the 
cup, she tossed it aside and walked 
over to her shadow. 

His skin was pitted with acne, his 
dingy shirt stained with sweat. 
“Why are you following me?” 

His hand reached for the tooth- 
pick as his thin lips puckered into a 
grin. His prying eyes worked their 
way down from her face. “Shake 
that creep and I’ll take you for a 
spin on my rentabike.” 

“You perverted freak.” 

The man jolted upright, his fea- 
tures twisting with rage. She spat 
into his face. 

She struggled with the grip on 
her arm as she was steered into a 
crowd mulling about an arcade. 

The young scientist swung her 
around so that she faced him. 
“You’re a fool, Windy Rode.” 
“Who asked you,” she retorted 
as she freed her arm. She walked 
away. 

He matched her stride. “He 
would have hit you.” 

“What if he had? What time is 
it?” 

He glanced at his watch. “Six- 
thirty.” 

“Damn.” She increased her 
pace. 

“Where are you going?” 

She stopped. “I don’t know.” 
“Well, I wish you would make 
up my mind.” 

“Make up your own mind.” She 

GALAXY 




sauntered over to a startrek tent. 

He argued with himself for a few 
moments before following. She was 
sitting at a CRT console drying her 
finger on her jeans. He sat down on 
the rickety stool at the next station. 

“Mr., Mr., I’m sorry I don’t re- 
call your name,” she said to him as 
she stared at the blank screen. 

“Dr. Randolph D. Bucknell, 
Randy for short.” 

“Dr. Bucknell, what ...” 

“Randy.” 

“Randy then, what did my 
mother do with Capuchin?” 

“Capuchin?” 

“That dog with the prehensile 
tail.” 

“Uh, anatomical studies, as I re- 
call. Yes, found an unusual locali- 
zation of ganglion in the lumbar 
spine. We wondered if it was a 
primitive brain that controlled the 
tail, but we couldn’t test the 
hypothesis. He was a fluke. We 
haven’t been able to recreate the 
genetic pattern, though I think your 
mother has a student working on 
it.” 

The operator came over to con- 
nect the CRT to a computer line, 
but Windy continued to stare at the 
unlit screen. 

“I’m sorry. Was he a pet?” 

“I wouldn’t expect anything else 
from her.” 

“Windy, your mother is a great 
woman. She’s attractive and intelli- 
gent and talented. Do you realize 
how lucky you are to be endowed 
with her genes?” 



“Sure, a xeroxed copy on dis- 
posable paper.” 

“That’s not fair. You’d better 
play before the machine shuts off.” 
She punched the key for a control 
report and inventoried her energy 
and photon torpedo supplies. Then 
she made a long range scan of the 
universe. 

“I wish I could open your eyes, 
Windy. She didn’t sacrifice your pet 
for nothing. If your mother seems 
rather unfeeling at times, it’s only 
because she has to be in this busi- 
ness. Windy, I’ve seen her brought 
to tears because of the freakish re- 
sults of some of our experiments. 
I’ve seen her tremble as she held a 
grotesque mass of living protoplasm 
in her hands. I know the feeling. 
You want to hide your face in 
shame for what you’ve done.” 
“Shame?” The eight-by-eight 
grid twinkled with two red star 
bases and a concentration of green 
Klingons in the lower left quadrant. 
“It’s not shame that she feels. It’s 
anger, anger at failure, and she does 
hate failure with all her gifted 
soul.” 

“You’re wrong.” 

“No, I’m not. I know because I 
am her.” 

“No, you’re not. You’re not 
telepathic, or are you?” 

“No, but I do know how her 
mind works. Believe me I do.” She 
activated her cloaking devices, set 
course in matrix code, and engaged 
warp drive. “Randy, how many 
other parthenogenic children have 



NIGHT RUNNERS 



121 




been created in the last seventeen 
years?” 

“Let’s see, you were the first. 
Singh’s daughter was next, I think. 
Yes, three, four, Briedlove had a 
son about five years ago. His was 
the first from a skin cell. There’s 
been several since then. About a 
dozen, I’d say. Why?” 

“Does everybody know about 
them?” A short-range scan showed 
that she was surrounded by enemy 
starships. 

“It’s never been a secret. There 
was quite a lot of publicity sur- 
rounding your birth. It impressed 
me and I was only six or seven at 
the time. You didn’t answer my 
question. Why? What difference 
does it make if there are others?” 

Estimating the angles to all three 
she dropped her shields and fired, 
getting two with photon torpedoes, 
crippling the other with phasers, and 
taking a direct hit in her hanger 
decks. “Ha, got all three. Do you 
remember last winter when my 
mother had that surgery for her ul- 
cers?” 

“Yes, her condition was criti- 
cal.” 

She studied the damage control 
report. “It took half my stomach to 
patch her up.” 

“What?” 

She had to return to star base for 
repairs. “I did not give consent. I 
went to the hospital to visit her and 
the next morning I woke up with 
tubes running through my nose.” 

“You mean that, that ...” 



“They said I couldn’t give con- 
sent because I was a minor. But 
that was just an excuse.” Activating 
the energy shields, she set a circuit- 
ous route, avoiding the sectors con- 
trolled by Klingons. 

“You’re not saying that she, that 
she would . Why don’t you get 
out, leave her?” 

“It’s not easy to run away these 
days.” Without turning she waved 
her right hand in front of his face. 
“The minute that finger goes down 
on a credit terminal she will know 
where I am. How far can I run be- 
fore I starve to death?” 

“Maybe someone could share 
credit with you.” 

“How would you like to live on 
half rations for who knows how 
long?” The damage control update 
indicated that repairs were in pro- 
gress. She maintained position. 

“I could,” he mumbled, blush- 
ing. 

“The carnies would for a price.” 

“What price?” 

“Never mind.” The Enterprise 
exploded, star base and all, in a 
giant supernova. “Blast it!” 

“It’s rigged. If you want an hon- 
est game use the school’s comput- 
er.” She stood up, but he remained 
seated. “Why don’t you try a 
lawyer?” 

“I did, as soon as I got out of 
that hospital. Would you believe 
that he said I don’t exist. Our 
chemprints are identical. There is 
no legal way to prove that I do 
either without Mother’s cooperation.

We’d have to appear together before 
a judge so that he could count to 
two. Those damned computers can’t 
count to two, but they sure can play 
favorites and give Winona Stokes 
Rode double rations.” 

“Surely your mother would coop- 
erate with a judge.” 

“You don’t believe me.” She 
looked down at her hands and 
began rubbing dirt away from the 
scratches. “I don’t think that lawyer 
did either. What’s the word of an 
immature girl with a paranoid com- 
plex compared to that of a world- 
famous scientist?” She turned 
around. “Let’s get out of here.” 

“There ought to be a way to alter 
your chemistry,” he said as they 
entered the midway. 

“I’ve tried finger paints, drugs. 
I’ve even exposed my hands to 
every kind of radioactive substance 
I could find in Dr. Maslen’s lab, 
but those damned registers still 
read Winona Stokes Rode in the 
singular.” 

They moved between the horror 
show and the fun house and their 
blaring noises. 

“Windy, I know your mother,” 
he shouted. “A simple tissue trans- 
plant is one thing, but I can’t be- 
lieve that she would go so far as to 
take your life to save hers, nor can 
I believe that any doctor would ac- 
tually do it.” 

“Don't underestimate the power 
and influence of my mother. When 
the time comes the question will be 
who is more valuable. There will be 



no precedents to guide them. They 
will have to decide whether I am an 
organ replacement bank or a human 
being. And I can’t seem to establish 
that very fact. By damn, I don’t want 
some doctor sitting in awe of my 
mother making that decision.” 

He followed her eyes toward the 
lifeless suggestion screen, a rocket 
ride darting about it. “Listen, 
Windy, I have an idea ...” 

“What time is it?” 

“Past seven. We could ...” 
“Dammit, I’m late.” 

“Late for what?” 

“A bridge tournament.” 

“With your mother?” 

“Yes.” 

“You must be good. Listen ...” 
“Not that good. What’s wrong 
with it?” she asked, still looking at the 
screen. 

“Probably blew a fuse. Listen, 
will you. You don’t have to go 
back. I’ve got a rentacar. I 
could ...” 

“I’ll bet it’s done with lasers.” 
She started jogging toward the hol- 
low screen. 

Exasperated, he held back, 
watching her as she stopped in front 
of the black hole, looking like a 
marionette forgotten on stage after 
the show was over. She moved so 
slowly that he was unaware of her 
motion until she was inside. 
“Don’t,” he gasped as he broke 
into a run. “Stop! Windy, stop!” 

He slid to a halt at the opening 
and reached for a wrist. She stum- 
bled as she came out, nearly falling.

“Get your hands off me.” 

“You could have been killed.” 
“Go to Hell.” 

His eyes and mouth pinched with 
anger he tightened his grip and 
headed for the exit. “Come on. I’m 
taking you home.” 

“Let go of me,” she said, hissing 
the words out between her teeth. 
“Let go or I’ll scream. I’ll cry 
rape. I warn you.” 

He slapped her arm down and 
spun around to face her. “I don’t 
give one damn about what you do, 
young lady, but I do care about 
your mother, and I am going to 
hear her side of this story.” 

“Go right ahead, but leave me 
out of it. I’m not going back.” 

“And just what do you intend to 
do?” 

“Well, I can’t stay with the car- 
nival, can I? You’ll go tattle to my 
mother.” 

“Why the carnival?” 

“Because they’ll feed me.” 

“Isn’t there somewhere else you 
could go?” 

“Jail.” 

“I mean a friend, a relative, a 
church, the Red Cross.” 

“I’ve got a friend right here. 
He’ll set me up.” 

“I don’t like it.” 

“Dr. Bucknell, I’m never going 
to go back.” 

He took a deep breath and let it 
out slowly. “Okay, I won’t tell, at 
least until I can figure this out. That 
is, as long as I know where to find 
you.” 



“Is that a promise?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then drive me to Des Moines 
tonight.” 

“What?” 

“Mother could be calling the 
cops right now, this minute. The 
first place they are going to look is 
this carnival. But I could link up 
with it in Des Moines, at the State 
Fair, after it’s been searched.” 

“I don’t know,” he hesitated, 
wondering how far he could trust 
her. 

“Dr. Bucknell, go back and take 
a good look at that suggestion 
screen. Those lasers are shielded 
with diffusion glass.” 

★ ★ ★ 

He paced in front of the orgy 
tent, not wanting to go in, not want- 
ing to see her in there. He paced 
and he watched the lights blink out 
one by one as the carnival closed 
down for a brief night’s rest. The 
sounds were dying, the static fad- 
ing, unmasking the giggles and 
laughter emanating from that tent. 

A man stepped through the tin- 
kerbell curtain. His grin disappeared 
as he met Bucknell’s gaze. He 
finished buckling his belt, spat on 
the cement, and walked away. 

An echo from the stadium an- 
nounced the beginning of the night 
runner races. 

Bucknell made his way around to 
the back of the tent and a flap open-

ing he had noticed earlier. There he 
waited in the shadows of a flare- 
wired fence. 

Several minutes later people, 
male and female, dressed in 
swatches of fur and body paint 
began to filter through the slit in the 
tent. Too tall, too short, too dark, 
too fat, too old, too masculine. He 
followed a pair wearing rabbit ear 
headdresses. 

One of the girls made a gesture 
with her hand as she talked. The 
scratches on her palm were red and 
swollen. 

Three paces later he was beside 
her, his hand biting into her shoul- 
der. “My God, Windy. How could 
you?” 

She winced and twisted away. 
The other girl screamed. Bucknell 
froze. Someone came running. 

“It’s all right,” Windy said, 
stepping between the striped man 
and Bucknell. “It’s all right. He’s a 
friend of mine. He startled us, 
that’s all.” 

“Are you sure?” the tiger man 
growled. 

“Yes, it’s all right.” 

“Sucker marks,” he hissed in 
Bucknell’s face and turned away. 

“Go on,” Windy motioned to the 
other girl. “I’ll catch up with you 
at the freak’s tea.” 

A moment later they were alone. 
Bucknell let his eyes trace the 
contours of her costume. It hid ev- 
erything and nothing, not even the 
scar under her sternum. Letting his 
eyes fall he kicked at an inert

shadow on the pavement and said, 
“So this is the price.” 

“At least I’m eating.” She began 
working the headdress out of her 
hair. 

“You can eat at home.” 

“That’s right.” 

“Windy, I had a long talk with 
your mother,” he said, looking up, 
searching for her eyes in the whis- 
kers and make-up. “She’s worried 
sick about you. She wants ...” 
“How sick?” 

“She looks bad. Her eyes are 
bloodshot. She’s extremely tense. I 
don’t think she’s been eating or

“Sounds like she needs another 
ulcer patch. No, thank you.” 

“I promised her I’d try to bring 
you back.” 

She retreated, saying accusingly, 
“You finked!” 

“No, I didn’t. I didn’t tell her 
where you were.” 

“You told her you knew where I 
was. That’s all she needs.” 

“I wasn’t followed, if that’s what 
you mean. I made sure I wasn’t. I 
checked myself for beepers before I 
left and I changed cars in Ankeny.” 
“Dammit, how can I be sure?” 
she said as she peered into the 
shadows. 

“Take my word for it, will you. 
I want you to go back of your own 
free will.” 

She bit at her lip. Tucking the 
headdress under her arm she began 
running her finger around the sore 
on her palm. 



“I believe your mother wants it 
that way too. She promised me that 
there would be no more operations 
without your consent.” He took a 
step toward her, looking at her 
hand. 

“Did you get that in writing?” 

“It wasn’t necessary. That needs 
a doctor.” 

“No doctor.” 

“It’s infected.” 

“Ginny said she’d lance it to- 
night, after the tea.” She began 
walking slowly. 

He fell in step by her side. 
“Your mother said that she would 
find a way to give you a legal iden- 
tity. She said that she’s been mean- 
ing to, but she just hasn’t had the 
time. You know how busy she is.” 
“Yes, and I know that she does 
break promises.” 

“If she has, it was probably for a 
good reason.” 

“She promised me that she 
would find Capuchin ...” 
“Capuchin?” 

“That dog with a prehensile tail. 
She promised me that she would 
find him a good home. Besides, if 
she really wants me to go back of 
my own free will, why is she offer- 
ing that reward for any information 
leading to my whereabouts?” 

“What reward?” 

“Don’t you read newspapers?” 
She skipped ahead. 

“Come on. I’ll show you how 
freaks have fun.” 

They skirted a series of tents and 
trailers and came upon a silent cir-

cle of light. Windy broke through, 
then stopped. He followed her in. 

“What’s the matter with ev- 
eryone? Minsky, start the music. I 
feel like dancing,’’ she shouted 
gaily and did a pirouette, waving 
the bunny ears like a fan. She 
glided over to a man entwined in a 
lawn chair. “Come dance with me, 
Rubber Man.’’ 

Shaking his head he raised a bot- 
tle to his lips. 

She stopped and looked at the 
woman curled up in the seat next to 
him. She was stroking the hair on 
her face as her eyes met Windy’s. 

“Let’s sing then.’’ 

“I don’t feel like singing to- 
night,” Ape Woman said softly, the 
words ringing pure like bell chimes. 

“What’s wrong?” Windy whis- 
pered, letting her eyes roam round 
the circle. 

Elephant Woman sat squarely on 
a high-back chair, her body over- 
flowing the edges, her eyes averted. 
Minsky kept his back to her as he 
fiddled with the recorder. A group 
in costume from the orgy tent began 
whispering among themselves. Tur- 
tle Man and Seal Man were sitting 
on handcrafted thrones perched on a 
folding table. 

“Come here. Windy,’’ Turtle 
Man said. 

She walked over to him slowly. 
Bucknell took a few steps toward 
her. 

“Who is he?” Turtle Man asked, 
nodding toward Bucknell. 

“Randy, the man I told you 



about, the one who refused to bring 
me here.” 

“Then he should take you back.” 

“No. I’m not going back, not 
ever.” 

“Windy. He cleared his throat 
and glanced at Bucknell. “Windy, 
you’ll never be a pitchman or any- 
thing else. Farnsworth is not going 
to let go. He wants to work you as 
a hound, a bitch. The next state we 
play has sixteen as the legal age. 
White slavery laws won’t apply. 
Windy, the games you’re playing 
now will be for real. Do you under- 
stand?” 

She clenched her jaw and nod- 
ded. 

“Go home, Windy.” 

“No, I can’t.” 

“You must.” He raised the stub 
of one arm. “Windy, you don’t be- 
long here.” 

The recorder blared a deafening 
Mexican bolero. 

A man dressed in street clothes 
brushed past Bucknell. Another ap- 
proached Windy from the other side. 
She whirled and backed into the table. 
Trapped. 

The struggle was brief. 

Bucknell stepped in front of them 
as they started to take her away. 

The music stopped. 

“I said, who are you?” 

“You fink!” 

“Get out of our way.” 

“Are you policemen? Is she 
under arrest?” Bucknell demanded, 
holding his ground. 

“You fink!” she shouted at him

again, her face pinched with hatred. 
“Let go of me.” 

“I demand to see your creden- 
tials.” Bucknell addressed himself 
to the shorter man. 

The others were gathering behind 
Bucknell, blocking their way. 

“You dirty, rotten fink!” she 
raged at Bucknell. 

“Can you hold her, Russ?” the 
shorter man asked his associate. 

“I’ve got her.” 

He released his grip and searched 
his inside jacket pocket. 

“You damned ...” 

“Windy, I called the police,” 
Turtle man said. 

She tried to turn toward him. The 
man holding her arm stepped 
around so that she could. “You?” 

“I had Minsky do it. Windy, 
don’t fight them. Go home.” 

“You? The reward. That damned 
reward. You!” 

She spun around, sending her 
knee into her captor’s groin. He 
gasped and loosened his grip. She 
broke loose. She scrambled onto the 
table, giving Turle Man’s throne a 
shove that set it rocking, and 
jumped down on the other side. She 
ran. 

Bucknell elbowed his way past 
the policemen, rounded the table, 
and darted into the shadows, lead- 
ing the pursuit. His long strides 
shortened the distance rapidly. 

She veered left, disappearing be- 
hind a tent. He drew up at the same 
place, turned, and slipped, his foot 
skidding across the asphalt on the 



rabbit ear headdress. 

The policemen caught up with 
him as he regained his balance. The 
taller man was still wincing with 
pain. They filed down the empty 
canyon between an arcade and a 
startrek tent. 

The midway was dark, the only 
light coming from street lamps on 
the fair grounds. There was no one 
in sight. 

“She must be in there,” the 
smaller man said, pointing to the 
thrillrides. “You take the far end, 
Russ this end. I’ll take the middle. 
We’ll flush her out.” 

Bucknell jogged down the mid- 
way, skipping over power cables. 
He felt the man panting at his back 
turn away. At the merry-go-round 
he cut in behind a register and 
slowed to a walk, listening. 

He moved toward the egomaze, 
watching the shadows and listening, 
but hearing only echoes from the 
stadium. 

“Windy,” he called in a whis- 
per. “Windy, it’s me, Randy. 1 
want to help you. Windy?” 

Under the rocket-ride, through 
the tilt-a-whirl rigging, around the 
suggestion screen, he moved call- 
ing, listening, calling, listening, 
hoping that he would be the first to 
find her. 

Through the slimy strands of the 
Medusa test he could see a large 
building. As he picked his way 
through the motionless serpents he 
noticed something moving. One of 
the policemen was jogging down 



128 



GALAXY 




the alley toward him, hugging the 
brick wall. 

He stepped over a snake, ducked 
under a coil, and emerged in the 
alley just as a figure darted from a 
side door of the building. She took 
two steps toward the policeman, pi- 
voted, and ran in the other direc- 
tion. 

“There she is,” the man shouted. 
“Get her.” 

Bucknell joined the chase, lead- 
ing the policeman by several me- 
ters. 

She hesitated a moment at the in- 
tersection with the main street of 
the fair, then turned right. The 
building shielded her from view. 
She couldn’t have been more than a 
dozen strides ahead when Bucknell 
made the comer. 

He was running down a sidewalk, 
animal bams on one side, vending 
trailers on the other. Windy was 
nowhere in sight. He cut out into 
the street and slowed to a trot, look- 
ing back over his shoulder. The 
policemen, both of them, were 
searching the concession stands and 
trailers. 

Looking over his other shoulder 
he traced the long line of the theater 
screen tucked under the grandstands 
of the huge, domed stadium. A 
muffled roar burst forth from the 
seats as one of the night runners 
took a water jump and fell to its 
knees, throwing its rider. The ani- 
mal’s enormous IR-sensitive eyes 
left a rainbow of reds and blacks 
across half the screen.

wm®. 






He was edging over to that side 
of the street, nearing the betting re- 
gisters, when he saw her bobtailed 
silhouette skirt the last row of seats. 
He took a deep breath and forced 
his legs to work harder. 

The night runner race ended with 
a roar of cheers and hisses. 

“Next race in ten minutes. Place 
your bets,” the speaker system 
rumbled with the mechanical voice. 

Bucknell was trapped, entangled 
in the stampede. Pushing his way 
through he stretched his neck to 
catch glimpses of her as she moved 
out of the theater and followed the 
contour of the stadium. 

He lost her just as he broke free. 
His feet clawed at the track before 
him, and the cement hit back, slap- 
ping hard against the soles of his 
shoes, jerking and jarring his over- 
tense body. 

He dodged a grounds sweeper, 
hurdling its multihinged arms. As 
soon as he cleared it he saw her. 
She was heading toward a line of 
hooded night runners. They were 
filing past a gap in the solid wall 
and disappearing into the blackness 
of the stadium’s interior. 

She fell, struggled to her feet. He 
pushed his legs harder, gaining 
ground with each step. She looked 
back, then staggered forward. 

“Windy,” he yelled between 
gasps for breath. “Windy. Stop.” 

He ran with his eyes glued on 
that white cotton tail. He ran and 
yelled — watched her plunge into the 
line of runners. 



One of the animals reared, its 
legs lashing frantically in its blind- 
ness. She went down. 

The jockey jerked on the reins 
and threw his weight to one side in 
an effort to turn the runner as it 
danced on its hind legs, but it 
wasn’t enough.

“I won’t go back,” she said, 
slurring the words as she fought for 
consciousness. “I won’t go back.” 

“Relax. Lie still now. We’ll take 
care of you.” The faceless voice 
grew faint. “That’s what I’d hoped 
for, a good sign.” 

“Is she going to be all right. 
Doctor?” 

The light was dull and bright. 
They had no faces, just eyes, a 
thousand eyes. 

“I won’t go back.” 

“The doctor said you’re going to 
be fine, Windy. Now do as he 
says.” 

Turning her head she saw her 
mother lying in a cradle of tentacled 
instruments. “Mother?” 

“Relax now. We’re going to give 
you an anesthetic. Just relax,” the 
doctor urged. “That’s it. Dr. Rode,

Let's juggle around some fulmi- 
nate of mercury this month, gang. 
Let’s examine women and science 
fiction. 

Hoo boy! Already the extremists 
of both sides are reflex ively finger- 
ins their knives. The feminist radi- 
cals are convinced I’m going to do 
a reverse-discrimination “dancing 
bear” routine (“The amazing thing 
about a dancing bear is not how 
well it dances, but that it dances at 
all.”); and the masculinist radicals 
(the MCP Backlash) are convinced 
I’ve sold out my cojones. How 
about if all of them radicals go off 
somewhere and shout at each other, 
while you and me have us a quiet 
conversation? 

We’re not talking here about 
women as characters in sf — that’s a 
whole ’nother column. Of course 
the dominant/submissive relation- 
ship that both men and women have 



BOOKSHELF 



131 



agreed to act out together for the 
last umpteen centuries has been re- 
flected in the portrayal of women in 
sf. Despite pioneering work by male 
writers like Anderson, Sturgeon, 
Pohl, Herbert, Dickson, and particu- 
larly Heinlein (whose women char- 
acters have almost invariably been 
important and respected members of 
their society, toughminded and 
competent) and by female writers 
like Merrill, LeGuin, Moore, Brac- 
kett and Norton, strong woman 
characters have statistically been as 
rare in sf as anywhere else, on the 
whole. (1 enjoyed the line I heard at 
a feminist discussion at MidAmeri- 
Con about Lieutenant Uhura: “They 
combined their token black and 
their token woman in one 
character — and then made her a 
telephone operator!”) 

But one of the biggest contribut- 
ing factors to this shortage has been 
the shocking shortage of good 
woman writers of sf, and that’s 
what we’re here to talk about this 
month. 

1 can find no evidence that any- 
one ever failed to sell a good sci- 
ence fiction story because she hap- 
pened to be a woman. Both Kate 
Wilhelm and Judith Merrill have 
said they found no difficulty in sell- 
ing sf under their own names — even 
though Judith did have to use what 
we might call noms de plums to sell 
westerns and mysteries. Yes, I 
know about C.L. Moore and D.C. 
Fontana and “Andre Norton” and 
the host of women who elected to 



use ambiguous pen-names — but I 
know of no one who initially failed 
to sell under their own name first. 
Editors want good stories — need 
them to survive — and will let noth- 
ing stop them from buying a good 
one from anyone. Hell, Mary Shel- 
ley’s Frankenstein CREATED the 
whole damn genre. And yet when 1 
first decided to do this column, it 
took me well over six months to 
acquire a column’s- worth of books 
by women. 

Clearly, the problem isn’t that 
women can’t sell sf. The problem 
is, not many women are writing the 
stuff. Or IS that the problem? Could 
it be that lots of women are writing 
sf, but their output is inferior? 

Ursula K. LeGuin. Kate 

Wilhelm. I rest my case. 

So why aren’t women writing sf? 
Well, 1 think it’s because writing, 
like any other artistic career, re- 
quires that you either live alone or 
have a very understanding 

spouse — and I must say I’ve met 
more mature wives than I have ma- 
ture husbands. It doesn’t help that 
writing is one of those lifetime 
careers (like Getting Your Doctor- 
ate) where you can put in from one 
to ten years before you see any 
solid return, with strong support re- 
quired for every one of those years 
along the way. It calls for a first- 
rate husband, and our culture trains 
men that sharing the scut-work is 
unmanly. 

But it’s getting easier. We’re all 
getting smarter. It may have taken 



132 



GALAXY 




me six months to assemble this col- 
umn, but not too long ago it might 
have been impossible. More women 
are writing — and reading — sf than 
ever before. 

Let’s examine their output. This 
is by no means an exhaustive — or 
even necessarily a representative — 
selection of women sf writers. It’s 
just what’s come over the transom 
lately. Five of the eleven books 
herein considered are first novels — 
a significant datum — so perhaps we 
should consider them first. 

★ ★ ★ 

In Cloned Lives , Pamela Sargent 
has written the first clone novel I’ve 
seen that doesn’t assume that clones 
will, by virtue of their biological 
similarity, become group-individuals 
indistinguishable from each other. 
Sargent has realized the obvious: 
that “genetically identical’’ does 
not equal “identical.’’ (Anyone 
who’s ever raised or known twins, 
triplets, quads or quints could have 
told us that.) This notebook I’m 
scribbling on right now is geneti- 
cally identical with the hypothetical 
one on which someone is now in- 
scribing a love note to his 
dachshund — it’s what you write on 
it that counts. 

What Sargent wrote on her tabula 
rasa is an extremely realistic tale of 
the near future. At about the time 
that the world scientific communi- 
ty’s self-imposed moratorium on 
genetic experimentation is expiring. 



a group of biologists succeed in 
producing five clones of a man 
named Paul Swenson (four males, 
one female). Sargent gives us a 
character-profile slice out of the life 
of each of the six, then ties them 
together in a final section which un- 
corks a few beautifully planted sur- 
prises. Throughout, the writing is 
fluid, the characterizations vivid and 
layered, the background world and 
the events that take place therein ut- 
terly plausible. 

Perhaps it’s that last that’s the 
problem. Like 2001 , Cloned Lives 
is so realistic, you catch yourself 
yawning. It doesn’t really go any- 
where, in a plot sense. 

This is not necessarily a fault. 
Edgar Pangborn’s books seldom 
have plots, and Dlmlgren sold a lot 
of copies. But plotless writing de- 
mands extremely colorful charac- 
ters, and the five clones in this 
book are just too damned ordinary 
to sustain my interest. I think that 
this was done consciously, that the 
whole point is that Clones Are Just 
People, and I applaud the point. 
Defusing prejudice before it begins 
is a lovely goal, and if more folks 
read this book, the race’s first real 
clones will have a much easier time 
of it. But you gotta make people 
read your book. 

I note that three of the seven 
chapters were previously published 
separately. Could it be that Cloned 
Lives didn’t start out to be a novel? 
That feels right — any one of these 
chapters would have kept me read-

ing, but there just wasn’t a novel’s 
worth of conflict. 

For me. I like sharp, urgent con- 
flict in my fiction. You might like 
this one just fine. 

★ ★ ★ 

On the other hand, Chelsea 
Quinn Yarbro’s first novel, Time of 
the Fourth Horseman , is chock fulla 
sharp urgent conflict, and I didn’t 
care for it much atall. The more 
pessimistic and cynical you are, the 
less you will tend to agree with me. 
If you’re borderline paranoid, you 
won’t agree with me at all. 

What we got here is a disaster 
novel, and here is your basic plot: 
an idealistic-but-tough woman doc- 
tor learns that her doctor-husband 
(with whom she thought she had a 
deeply intimate and loving relation- 
ship) is one of the heads of a vast 
government-sponsored secret con- 
spiracy to reduce the population 
crush by quietly replacing a third of 
all vaccines with placebos. She is 
unable to dissuade him, and indeed 
she and the very small band of doc- 
tors who are upset by this Modest 
Proposal find themselves discredited 
and disgraced. Apparently they 
can’t even get the Washington Post 
interested, even when stupendous 
epidemics of supposedly extinct dis- 
eases start ripping the country apart. 
(Curiously, this decimation of the 
populace doesn’t seem to affect in- 
ternational relations any — or maybe 
Henry Kissinger is supposed to have 



secured gentleman’s agreements 
from all the rest of the world’s gov- 
ernments to implement similar pro- 
grams at the same time.) From 
there, horror succeeds horror for 
183 jading pages — for, as anyone 
would have guessed, the Great Dis- 
eases, roused from their slumber, 
proceed to mutate into truly un- 
stoppable killers. 

Three famous sf writers and an 
M.D. state on the back cover that 
they found this premise “chillingly 
plausible.’’ If you agree, I believe 
we’re in serious trouble. 

Because one of the manifestations 
of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Prin- 
ciple as applied to mankind is that 
what we all agree to be plausible 
becomes so, and if we agree that 
this is a plausible premise, I’m 
going to go flush my head down the 
toilet — spare them Evil Politicians 
’n’ Doctors the bad karma of 
slaughtering me. 

But the premise ain’t my only 
complaint. I couldn’t tell the charac- 
ters apart without a program, and 
they tended to be stereotyped (even 
the death of their only son doesn’t 
deter the husband from his Malthu- 
sian determination). The plot was 
rudimentary, largely a cataloguing 
of horrors to flesh out the premise. 
I felt I was being milked for horror, 
and so found myself becoming 
nearly as callous as the villains. 
And the writing was fluid enough, 
but extremely hasty: too many times 
a doctor spied an incoming patient 
with a fever and flushed skin and 



134 



GALAXY 




muttered, “By God, if I didn’t 
know better I’d swear that was an- 
thrax.’’ (No, that's not a direct 
quote, and yes, it’s a bit exagger- 
ated.) 

This is a book plainly designed to 
play on — and therefore promote — 
your paranoia, and you’re supposed 
to walk away from it horrified and 
afraid and ashamed to be human 
and frustrated to despair at your 
helplessness before The Great Con- 
spiracy of Evil Ones In Power, and 
I say phooey. 

★ ★ ★ 

And now, for an even more 
warped premise, we bring you Susy 
McKee Chamas’s first novel, Walk 
to the End of the World. I heard Ms 
Charnas refer to this book (at 
MidAmeriCon) as “a rather 
straightforward extrapolation of 
things as they are,’’ and my hair 
stood on end. The premise, 
explicitly laid out right in front in a 
two-page prologue, is as follows: 

Dem Evil Politicians have finally 
done it — The Wasting has come, 
and the world goes to hell. All 
these Evil Ones are men — all the 
women in government “had re- 
signed or had been pushed out as 
idealists or hysterics.’’ Now it 
chances that a handful of these Evil 
Ones escape the Wasting in 
previously-prepared shelters — and of 
course they bring women with them 
as routine provisions. Needing a 
scapegoat for their own subcon- 



scious guilt, the Evil Men debase 
these women, fix upon them the 
blame for the Wasting (“The 
woman tempted me.”), and by the 
time they emerge from their fallout 
shelters have reduced all women to 
degenerate beasts of burden. In fact, 
they tolerate said beasts only 
because reproduction seems 
desirable — for enjoyable sex, they 
prefer each other. The women 
themselves, by the way, cooperate 
almost unanimously: . it would 

be proper and a relief to think of 
nothing but babies any more, and 
while the men were crazy with 
grief, guilt and helplessness it was 
support they needed, not an- 
tagonism.” The few dissenters are 
silenced with clubs, and the next 
generation are, of course, all good 
little products of their conditioning. 
Oh yeah, I nearly forgot: they grow 
marijuana for food. 

Got it? 

That’s the first two pages. Now, 
I thought at first that that was why 
my first three attempts to read the 
book ended in failure. Anyone who 
holds her brothers and sisters in 
such contempt is not likely to tell 
me anything I want to hear. But a 
friend of mine finished it and said, 
“If you grant the crazy premise, it’s 
not a bad book.” So 1 made two 
more attempts. 

My record was page 32. Even 
granting the psychotic premise, I 
found the story that ensued con- 
fused, confusing, inconsistent and 
boring.

Like most diatribes. 

★ ★ ★ 

Vonda McIntyre’s first, The Exile 
Waiting , avoids all the above 
errors — she never lost my interest, 
and she has no axe to grind. What 
she did was write a cracking good 
adventure with a very real cast who 
undergo exciting events that change 
them all deeply. 

The background world is de- 
scribed mostly by suggestive details 
(my favorite method), and seems 
both consistent and fascinating — I 
have a few minor quibbles, and you 
may too, but nothing serious. The 
characterization is excellent — it’s 
obvious that McIntyre cares deeply 
for all of her characters, and indeed 
I had a hard time deciding how 
many of them could properly be 
called protagonists (I make it four 
or five, and even the minor charac- 
ters breathe with life). The style is 
slightly “experimental,” and quite 
successfully so: evidence of artistry 
rather than pretension to it. And the 
ending is more than satisfactory. 
What more could you ask? 

Well, quite a bit, actually. I can’t 
honestly say that Exile is a Great 
Book. But it is damned good, and 
surely one of the most promising 
first novels I’ve ever seen. This is a 
woman who has a Left Hand of 
Darkness in her somewhere. And 
even if it never emerges, I could 
settle for a couple dozen more 
“merely” enjoyable and thoughtful 
books like this. 



In times like these, an enjoyable 
book is something of a godsend. 

★ ★ ★ 

Now I come to the first-novel 
that provoked the most ambiguous 
reaction, the one that’s hardest to 
review Just Right: Octavia N. But- 
ler’s Patternmaster. 

It would be very easy to do a 
killer on this book: it has many 
things wrong with it, some little and 
some gigantic. My chief objection 
is that it leaves unanswered every 
moral question it raises — or rather 
answers them unsatisfactorily. It 
posits a world in which 
psionically-gifted humans called 
Patternists rule over thought- 
controlled slave/serfs called 
Mutes — that is, ordinary humans — 
and all of these are at war with mu- 
tated sphinx-like humans called 
Clayarks, who are painted as 
courageous fighters and potentially 
likable sentient beings. Yet the 
book concerns itself only with a 
Nine-Princes-In-Amberesque power- 
struggle for succession to the throne 
of the dying Patternmaster by his 
two strongest sons. In the end, one 
of them wins, kills his brother, 
massacres a few hundred Clayarks, 
and settles down to slavemastering 
his Mutes. Curtain. I found this out- 
rageous, particularly given the 
“hero’s” own vivid loathing of 
mind-control. 

There are other holes too, enough 
to make a noticeable pile in the 



136 



GALAXY 




comer of the Albert Hall. And yet 1 
liked Patternmaster , better than the 
first three books in this column 
anyway. 

Why? Well, partly some good 
characterization — particularly Am- 
ber the Healer, one of the 
strongest female protagonists since 
Alyx (comically juxtaposed with 
Rayal, a more or less traditional 
hero-sterotype who is dismayed by 
Amber’s refusal to be a traditional 
heroine-stereotype). But I think it 
was mostly sheer narrative thrust, 
pure story-telling, that pleased me 
most. Butler kept me turning the 
pages, simple as that: an indefinable 
skill and a rock-bottom essential for 
a writer. Butler has as much of it as 
Vonda McIntyre — what she needs 
now is a carefully thought-out story 
to tell. 

★ ★ ★ 

Enough of first novels. Let’s re- 
turn to Pamela Sargent again, for an 
anthology of stories by women, 
about women: More Women of 
Wonder (sequel to an antho which 
you’ll never guess what it was 
called, that I haven’t received for 
review yet). And before we get 
started. I’d like to talk about the in- 
troduction Sargent supplies. It is for 
the most part a reasonably accurate 
history of woman in sf, both as 
characters and as creators — but 
when it slips into speculation about 
the future it begins to horrify me. 
As when Sargent calls “understand- 



able” and “a temptation” the con- 
tention of R.C.W. Ettinger that 
“. .it is a little hard to see why 
suckling or carrying a child should 
produce a special bond, any more 
than in other forms of parasitism. 
Does one feel special tenderness 
toward his tapeworm? ... it de- 
grades the woman, reduces her to a 
biological machine.” 

But enough. On to the stories. 
There are six novelettes and one 
short story, and of these I hated 
two, found three so-so and loved 
two. This gives us about a 50% on 
the Spidermeter, but the two 
goodies are so good, let’s make it 
60% with a recommendation to buy. 

The ones I didn’t like: Joanna 
Russ’s “The Second Inquisition” 
(Joanna consistently and pointedly 
refuses to obey the rules of storytel- 
ling, even when it would help her. 
If she’s not willing to meet me 
halfway . .); and Kate Wilhelm’s 
“The Funeral” (the only thing of 
hers I’ve ever actively loathed — I 
agree it’s a work of artistry, but I 
don’t want it in my living room). 

The three that were so-so: 
Josephine Saxton’s “The Power of 
Time” just didn’t grab me much; 
Leigh Brackett’s “The Lake of the 
Gone Forever” was a bit turgid and 
trite by modern standards — but then 
it was written in 1949, and did 
move me; and C.L. Moore has writ- 
ten much better stuff than the Jirel 
of Joiry series. (Jirel was revolu- 
tionary in her day, but only as a 
token figure, proof that women can

swashbuckle too. Fine, but it’s a 
silly thing for anyone to do, regard- 
less of gender.) 

Ah, but the two gems . 

Well, one of them you may al- 
ready have. Ursula K. LeGuin’s 
“The Day Before The Revolution” 
originally ran right here in Galaxy , 
reran in Best Of Galaxy Vol. Ill , 
won the 1974 Nebula, and has 
shown up here and there since. The 
first two times I tried to read it 
(quite awhile ago), 1 got disgusted 
and put it down after five or six 
pages. But by the time I got to this 
anthology I had learned that the 
way to approach LeGuin is very 
slowly, no distractions, and trust 
her. So I tried again, and sure 
enough it paid off in spades. 
“Day” is not a story, and if you try 
to read it as one you’ll end up feel- 
ing as cheated as I did the first 
time. It has no plot: nothing hap- 
pens except a drooling old lady rem- 
inisces about her past. But forget 
that: think of it as an excerpted 
interlude from an as-yet-unwritten 
novel if it helps, but enjoy the bas- 
tard. It’s writing at its best, beauti- 
ful and deeply moving. 

And now the one I saved for last: 
“Tin Soldier,” by Joan D. Vinge. 
As it happens, I just hadn’t seen 
anything by Vinge at Hugo-time — 
but if I had seen this piece, I would 
unquestionably have voted her the 
John W. Campbell Award for Best 
New Writer hands down — in fact, 
the story itself deserves a Hugo (it 
originally ran in Orbit 14 , which I 

138 



failed to read). It is an incredibly 
poignant tale of two sort-of immor- 
tals who commit themselves to a 
love affair that seems hopeless. She 
is “immortal” by virtue of FTL 
time-dilation — she’s a Spacer, who 
returns to Earth every “few weeks” 
to find 25 years gone by (only 
women can be Spacers, by the 
way — take that. Captain Kirk!). He 
is “immortal” by virtue of 
constructicpn — he’s a prosthetic 
cyborg, a bartender (called the Tin 
Soldier) whose body is mostly plas- 
tic and alloy replacements (except 
for the exception obviously neces- 
sary for a love story). The story of 
their relationship, around gaps that 
are a few weeks for her, a quarter- 
century for him — with the complica- 
tion of a rigid Spacer taboo against 
ever making love with the same 
man twice — is magnificently 
wrought, told with genuine warmth 
and subtle artistry. I look forward 
very eagerly to more from Joan 
Vinge.

Another antho, but this one is in- 
tegrated: men allowed. (Honest to 
God, I just heard about an editor of 
a proposed book of women’s sf who 
has decided to include stories by 
men, too, “to avoid legal questions 
about discrimination on the ba is of 
sex.” Were any of you male writers 
out there really contemplating a 
class action?) 

Aurora: Beyond Equality has an 

GALAXY 




ambitious and intriguing premise. 
Contributors were asked to write 
stories based on a world in which 
sexism has already been trans- 
cended. ‘ ‘After equality, then 
what?” is what editors Vonda 
McIntyre and Susan Janice Ander- 
son (is there something feminist 
about having three names?) wanted 
to know. 

Me too. This antho sure doesn’t 
tell me. 

Anderson spends six pages of 
intro passing on misinformation 
about the “pioneers of non-sexist 
sf,” betraying her virtual ignorance 
of anything written B.R. (Before 
Russ), and complains how difficult 
it was to get the kind of stories she 
and McIntyre wanted: “ ‘Before I 
can even begin to write, I have to 
create an entirely new society,’ 
moaned one of our contributors.” 
(Obviously this contributor had 
never written sf before: you’re sup- 
posed to do that, with every story.) 
Perhaps this is meant to excuse the 
fact that five of the ensuing eight 
stories have nothing whatever to do 
with the stated premise. 

Raccoona Sheldon’s “Your 
Faces, O My Sisters! Your Faces 
Filled of Light!” is not sf at all, 
and as bad as the title would lead 
you to expect: a psychotic woman 
walks through New York City, hal- 
lucinating an imaginary Post- 
Collapse world where all the men 
are gone somehow, leaving only 
loving sisters. While she fantasizes, 
she is raped and killed. Curtain. 



James Tiptree’s “Houston, Hous- 
ton, Do You Read?” is about a 
world in which equality resulted 
from the mysterious death by plague 
of all men — whereupon the women 
quickly and easily built a utopia. 
Into this utopia a male astronaut 
crew is propelled by the usual 
Time- Warp, and we soon learn that 
in a truly sane (i.e. female) society, 
the best thing to do with men is put 
them to sleep as humanely as possi- 
ble after taking sperm samples for 
study). Uh huh. 

Dave Skal’s story never even por- 
trays the society its protagonists 
discuss, never mentions gender one 
way or the other, and ends before 
anything has happened. Mildred 
Downey Broxon contributes a 
straight fairy tale set in ancient Ire- 
land; again, nothing touching on 
sexual equality either way. P.J. 
Plauger’s “Here Be Dragons” is a 
sea-war story in which it is briefly 
mentioned — but not demonstrated or 
discussed — that one of the combat- 
ting ships is more efficiently han- 
dled because it has an integrated 
crew: a debatable point. 

I should point out that of these 
five stories, three (Tiptree of 
course, Broxon and Plauger) were 
well-crafted and enjoyable, even if 
they did ignore the assignment — but 
all three were minor works. 

Of the three writers who actually 
attempted to fulfill the title’s 
premise, two produced abominable 
stories: Joanna Russ’s “Corruption” 
is even more unreadable than usual, 



BOOKSHELF 



139 




and Craig Strete’s story is opaque 
self-indulgence combined with 
Amerind propaganda. 

BUT: I really loved Marge Pier- 
cy’s “Woman on the Edge of 
Forever,” a genuine attempt to por- 
tray a non-sexist society of the fu- 
ture (one which actually includes 
men!). As with Sheldon’s story, it 
may all be just an hallucination on 
the part of the protagonist — but 1 
don’t care. What a lovely hallucina- 
tion! Beautiful, powerful writing, 
much thought, and a basic fierce 
love for her own characters: all 
these consistent attributes kept re- 
minding me of Sturgeon at his best. 
I especially enjoyed Piercy’s 
imaginative non-sexist pronouns, 
something I’d have sworn couldn’t 
be done painlessly. According to 
the bio-stuff at the end of the book, 
this story is excerpted from a 
novel-in-progress which I’d greatly 
like to see. 

AND: there’s a thoughtful essay 
by Ursula K. LeGuin, reflecting 
back on Left Hand , which is as en- 
joyable as everything that lady 
writes. 

BUT: put it all together and it 
comes out about 35 9c on the 
Spidermeter. As I’ve said before, 
editors shouldn’t make premises 
they can’t keep. And this one was 
such a tantalizingly interesting prem- 
ise .. 

★ ★ ★ 

I’ve about run out of new stuff. 



How about a few Old Pros? 

I may as well talk about Kate 
Wilhelm’s The Clewiston Test now. 
I’ve been stalling on it, hoping I’d 
get the time to re-read it, because 
my reactions to it are so ambiguous 
and confusing. But there’s no time, 
so . 

What it is, I think, is a portrait of 
a marriage being torn apart by 
stress, as seen through the eyes of 
both husband and wife. It would 
take much too long to explain the 
plot, or exactly why the book so 
angered and frustrated me, but basi- 
cally it comes down to this: we are 
presented with what SEEMS to be 
an either-or situation. Either the 
wife’s perceptions are correct, and 
her supposedly loving husband is 
really a hopeless neurotic — or, the 
husband’s perceptions are correct, 
and his wife has secretly taken an 
experimental drug with behavior- 
altering side-effects. Now, the end- 
ing of the book seemed to me, 
when I read it, to vindicate the 
wife — she makes no attempt to re- 
pair the marriage, even refusing to 
explain to her husband what she 
feels he’s been doing wrong, and 
walks out. 

A supporting character spends the 
closing pages admiring and con- 
gratulating her for her triumphant 
enlightenment, and the husband ap- 
parently wanders off to try and de- 
duce, from the few extremely mis- 
leading hints she’s dropped, just 
what went wrong. Feminist friends 
of mine just loved the ending — 



140 



GALAXY 




especially divorcees. 

Trouble is, I remained convinced 
at the end that it was the wife who 
was cracking up — 1 believed, right 
up until I was specifically told 
otherwise at the end, that she had 
taken the drug. So the ending frus- 
trated me. 

Then I heard Kate, at 
MidAmeriCon, tell a roomfull of 
feminists that the notion of subor- 
dinating her art to a vehicle for 
feminist propaganda — for any 
cause — appalled her. So I went up 
after and asked her how the hell 
come she’d written such a 
feminist-propaganda book, and she 
blinked in surprise and said she 
hadn’t. 

I guess I read it wrong, and I 
fully intend to go back and read the 
book a second time — and I urge you 
to read it in any case. Like every- 
thing from Kate’s typewriter, it is 
exquisitely crafted and holds the at- 
tention like a magnet — and it will 
probably confuse and annoy you for 
as long as you try and make it grind 
your axe for you. I think my prob- 
lem was in seeing the characters as 
symbols rather than people. The 
Sexual Liberations wars have left us 
all a bit paranoid, one way or the 
other. 

The book is not, by the way, 
packaged as sf at all — you’ll have 
to venture out of the sf section of 
your bookstore. But don’t let that 
stop you: it’s a science fiction 
novel, all right — and who knows 
what you might stumble across 



while you’re looking for it? 
(“. to boldly go where no fan 
has gone before.”) 

★ ★ ★ 

Running out of room. Let’s hurry 
on to Zenna Henderson’s stories of 
The People. A movie based on 
them just came on the tube re- 
cently, and it inspired me to dig 
both Pilgramage and No Different 
Flesh out of the jumble and re-read 
them. Sometimes you forget just 
how nice an old friend is if you 
haven’t seen 'em for awhile. 

Both books are disguised 
novelette-collections, but better dis- 
guised than usual, with connective 
sections that really work in giving 
novel-thrust to a bunch of collected 
episodes. Both are very slightly 
overwritten, and both have a ten- 
dency to get a bit too sugary for my 
taste in spots. But both are extraor- 
dinarily enjoyable stories about real 
characters, told with warmth, in- 
sight, and genuine compassion. 
Zenna, too, reminds me of Theo- 
dore Sturgeon, in that the conflicts 
which interest her are the personal, 
interior ones. She is old-fashioned 
enough (God help us all) to believe 
that humans can act admirably and 
lovingly — and optimistic enough to 
believe that an extraterrestrial race 
which does so as a matter of course 
might just bring out the best in 
some of us. I like Zenna for some 
of the same reasons I like 
Pangborn, Sturgeon and LeGuin — 
because I admire and respect her

characters, and because she holds 
out some hope for Homo Sap. 

And because she’s a first-rate 
storyteller. 

Check out both of these books, if 
you haven’t already. The first is a 
hair better than the second — but you 
won’t mind at all, and both books 
will stay with you for a long time.

Happens I’d never sampled any 
of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Dark- 
over cycle — they just didn’t look 
like something I’d get into. But 
then I was doing this women’s col- 
umn, and here was The Bloody Sun 
on my desk, so . 

Now, granted I’m not familiar 
with the series — but that’s not my 
problem, it’s Bradley’s. Granted 
this seems to be one of the minor 
Darkover novels — if I’m going to 
read just one, it ought rightly to be 
one of the biggies: Heritage of Has- 
tur , say. But this is what I had, what I 
read — and I didn’t care for it. 

I didn’t believe the hero: his 
“personality” seemed to be nothing 
much more than the precise collec- 
tion of neuroses and compulsions 
which would keep him moving 
through the plot, shifting with the 
requirements of each scene. The 
plot itself was Byzantine, reminding 
me irresistibly of those Robert Bench- 
ley operasynopsis parodies where 
Immergluck descends from Valhalla 
in a golden Chrysler at the end of 
Act IV to reveal that it was really 
Ellen and not Helen who was stolen 



by the gypsies, producing the 
bloodstained derby as proof. 

I mean, it was okay light reading, 
but I didn’t believe it for a minute. 

★ ★ ★ 

As I warned vou, this hasn’t been 
an exhaustive or even representative 
look at women writers: I haven’t 
mentioned anything by Katherine 
Maclean or Judy Merrill or Lisa 
Tuttle or Kathleen Sidney or Sonya 
Dorman or Phyllis Gotlieb or Andre 
Norton or Anne McCaffrey 
or . the list is long. But we’ve 
seen enough to support my original 
contention: women may be a statis- 
tical minority in sf, but their 
talent/no talent ratio is as good as or 
better than that of male writers, and 
more women should be writing. 

How do we arrange this? Well, if 
any of you are women who are 
thinking of becoming writers, I 
strongly advise you to marry (if 
anyone) another artist of some kind. 
I’m a writer, Jeanne’s a dancer, and 
we split the scut-work fifty-fifty — 
except when one or the other of us 
gets hot on the scent of the Muse, 
whereupon the other one takes over 
full responsibility for the house- 
running and baby-raising for awhile. 
Nothing less will serve, and I don’t 
believe I could be a writer without 
the agreement Jeanne and I have 
made. Don’t settle for less than the 
best, is all I can advise you. 

Because we urgently need more 
good writers, if sf is to survive 
boom times. ★

When James Webster 
speaks— you listen! 



M!y death won’t bring out the 
banner headlines. That’s fine with 
me. I suppose by rights I should be 
up there with Lee Harvey Oswald, 
Sirhan Sirhan, Leon Monde and 
What’s-his-name Bremer. I’ll settle 
for being the one that got away. 
Saved civilization, too — as I see 
civilization — but that won’t last too 
long. Just until I'm gone. 

Do not go gentle into that good 
night. I hear you, Dylan, and I’ll 
keep up the struggle. But I’ve rid- 
den ten thousand days and nights 
from James Webster’s death. I’m 
old and tired, and no man lives 
forever. It’s the risht time for this. 

Why am I recording here? Maybe 
I can’t bear to see a piece of history 
going wrong into the record books. 
And maybe I want to warn my 
spiritual heirs to be ready when it 
happens again. 

I came to cover the Webster 
campaign in ’80 by accident. Got in 
late, when Jim Dotter had his first 
stroke. It’s been a short twenty 
years since Jim went. I still re- 
member the shock of the news, the 



rush to get ready and out of the of- 
fice and onto the plane. It sounds 
like boasting when I say that I was 
overkill for that local primary but 
I’m past the age for modesty — and I 
don’t expect I’ll have to defend this 
to anybody. 

There was no time for a briefing 
from the Channel before I was on 
my way, but after thirty years I 
could manage well without it. Dur- 
ing the flight I read releases of 
Webster’s speeches and looked at 
the local coverage reports of his 
meetings. The combination didn’t 
make much sense. Trite words, 
banal sentiments — and a tremendous 
response from the crowds. Some- 
thing was out of tune. Thin gruel in 
the speeches, rich reactions from 
the audiences. 

I picked up the campaign trail in 
Atlanta. Peach blossom time, with 
the heat cracking eighty the af- 
ternoon I flew in. You could see the 
Southern beauties opening in the 
sun like buds. Riding in from the 
airport I could feel a pressure in the 
air like the undercurrent of a thun- 
derstorm. Electricity, building up 
and raising the hair on the back of 
my neck — and all on a cloudless 
March afternoon. I’d felt it only 
twice before, and never as strongly. 
People fever. Alamogordo, on the 
day of the first test of the first 
bomb. And Washington, D.C. the 
afternoon of Nixon’s resignation. 
Something was taking hold of At- 
lanta and winding it up like the 
spring on an old-fashioned watch.

There’s not a gift the world can 
give like that it takes away. I won’t 
argue the point, but seniority has its 
advantages. The younger men were 
eager to tell me what had happened 
before I had arrived. A movement 
for Webster, building to great peaks 
every night at his open-air rallies. 
Orgasms of emotional response that 
left the audiences drained but up- 
lifted. That, from experienced 
newsmen. Whatever it was that the 
vintners buy, James Webster was 
selling it in Atlanta. 

As you may know from my writ- 
ing, human interest isn’t my main 
line. For political analysis, I need 
facts. Over bourbon and branch I 
got a fair sprinkling of them from a 
young local reporter. Webster had 
sprung up from nowhere, overnight. 
No previous track record in politics, 
no big backers pushing him along 
as a puppet — but somehow he had 
persuaded the local power groups 
that he could take this primary. 

Support staff? Almost none. 
Lighting up a big cigar (building an 
ima^e — how well 1 remembered it. 
Thirty years earlier I was struggling 
to keep a pipe alight) the youngster 
went on. Webster made all the 
plans for his meetings himself, 
wrote his own speeches to the last 
comma, set the exact timing for ev- 
erything. Brief press conferences, 
and no remarks off the record. 

“Ever try for an interview with 
him?” I asked. 

“Oh, sure. No good though — a 
few words with him on the tele- 



phone were as far as I got,” he 
said. Not too surprising — a local 
and an unknown began with a 
couple of strikes against him. 

How about family and friends? A 
bit more meat there. From a rich 
family near Athens, Georgia, but 
James Webster was almost the end 
of the line. One great aunt still liv- 
ing, up north of Athens on the fam- 
ily estate. Easy enough to get to see 
her, but hard to understand what 
she said when you did. Yes, he’d 
done that, was sure I could do it 
too. 

I brightened a bit. Old ladies are 
one of my strong points. Either I 
just like them, or they relish my po- 
lite approach. Miss Amelia Webster 
would be on my visiting list. 

Before we could get to Webster’s 
early life it was time to cover the 
evening rally. My young friend put 
out his cigar with considerable re- 
lief, and we left. 

Outside, there was still that feel- 
ing of excitement in the air. The 
swarms of people converging on the 
great field where Webster held his 
rallies were chattering to each other 
as though a real treat was in store 
for them. At a political rally? There 
may be duller events in the world, 
and the political pros do get a big 
kick from them — but they are 
caviare to the general public. 

I took up my position in the 
crowd, about a third of the way 
back from the stage. Like the 
psychologist at the burlesque show, 
I got part of my moneysworth look- 



WHAT SONG THE SIRENS SANG 



145 




ing at the reactions of the audience. 

It began at eight, with no intro- 
ductory speakers or warm-ups. 
First, a low pleasant music from the 
big speakers hung around the field. 
Familiar, vaguely so, but I couldn’t 
place it. At eight-five, Webster 
came on to the floodlit stage with 
its black curtains and white canopy. 
I began to make notes. 

Short, tendency to pudginess, re- 
ceding dark hair, a pleasant plump 
face. No sign of the great vitality or 
exceptional good looks that the 
charismatic (dreadful word) lead- 
ers so often enjoy. He stepped for- 
ward to the battery of microphones 
and began to speak. To my surprise 
the soft music continued, blending 
with his words. 

Like most reporters, I have a 
very good memory for words. We 
need it. It’s party training, partly 
natural talent. I’ve taught myself to 
supplement memory, as a matter of 
course, with notes made on the fly 
during speeches. With their aid I 
can get an almost verbatim recon- 
struction. 

After Webster’s speech I realized 
that I had encountered a unique 
phenomenon. For the first time in 
twenty years, I had forgotten to take 
any notes. 

Forgotten? That’s the wrong 
word. My notes of his speech 
read — in total — “slightly nasal 
voice. Odd variations in pitch and 
intonation.’’ That’s it, the whole 
thing. I had stopped writing because 
listening had become so important, 



I didn’t want to risk missing a 
word. 

Webster was amazing. When he 
talked about the past, I felt as 
though I could see and hear the 
fathers of the country, working to 
create and protect my heritage. 
When he spoke of the future, I felt 
my duties, my responsibility, my 
part in building a brave new world 
for our children. I felt these, physi- 
cally, like a fever in my blood. As 
Webster directed I laughed, I 
dreamed, I raged, I cried, I plan- 
ned. At last he ceased and raised 
his arms above his head. After a 
long hushed pause the first tentative 
applause built rapidly and became 
thunderous and prolonged. 

Back in my hotel room at mid- 
night I tried to draft an article to 
send north. It wouldn’t come. How 
do you put on paper the most stir- 
ring event of your life? After a 
while I stopped trying and leaned 
back in my chair. A new but very 
old thought was tugging at the edge 
of my attention. I’m just old enough 
to remember the newsreels of the 
goose-stepping figures and the 
crashing shouts of ‘Sieg Heil.’ 
There is something very frightening 
about a crowd with a single 
mind — a mob, that’s still the best 
word for it. If James Webster had 
told us to go and pull down City 
Hall, what would we have done? I 
could guess. 

I didn’t sleep well.

Next morning I called Webster’s 
campaign office and asked for an 
interview. After a surprisingly short 
run-around from a secretary, he 
came on the telephone himself. Was 
I the Bill Forrest of T.V. and 
newspaper fame? Yes, I was. (Van- 
ity, vanity, all is vanity. I never 
failed to get a thrill from being rec- 
ognized, even by crooks and vil- 
lains.) Again, the seniority was 
paying off. Webster would be very 
happy to see me at his office at two 
o’clock. 

Close-up, I confirmed last night’s 
impression. Physically unimpres- 
sive, with a distant look in his eyes. 
I began the interview conventionally 
and asked about the election. 

If you had asked me about Web- 
ster’s voice after last night’s speech 
I would have ignored my first scrib- 
bled note and told you that it was 
compelling and persuasive. Today it 
was nothing. Monotonic, soft. He 
wouldn’t look me in the eye. Yes, 
this was his first campaign. No, he 
would refuse a television interview 
now, he was not quite — 
hesitation — prepared for it. Perhaps 
in a month or so. Certainly, he was 
completely confident of a win here. 
Future plans? Wait and see, but this 
was only a beginning. 

After three quarters of an hour I 
gave up and left. James Webster 
was sharp and confident all right 
but he came across to me as a cold 
fish, a man you wouldn’t trust with 
a dime or your daughter. I knew I 
couldn’t send back an interview that 

WHAT SONG THE SIRENS SANG 



said that, without rhyme or reason, 
I disliked and distrusted the man. 
But I did, strongly. 

What had happened to the man 
who had spoken last night? No sign 
of him today. One phrase came 
back again. Not prepared for a 
television interview yet. Why had 
he agreed to an interview with me? 
Well, I could guess at that. Even a 
villain — and that’s how I was think- 
ing of Webster now, with no evi- 
dence to support me — likes to go on 
ego-building trips. 

-I’d picked up a few useful things 
during the interview. First and 
foremost, James Webster thought 
that James Webster was wonderful. 
I’ve sensed that from many — from 
most — politicians, but here it came 
across as a contempt for anything 
that was not James Webster. Long- 
time politicians may feel that way, 
some of them, but they hide it a 
whole lot better. Second, the cam- 
paign really was one hundred per- 
cent his own. No one else was more 
than a minor hanger-on, dispensed 
with if and when Webster chose to 
do it. 

I had a day of useless churning 
and frustration, until I finally rented 
a car and drove north for Athens, 
and Miss Amelia Webster. Accord- 
ing to James Webster she was his 
only surviving relative. I wanted to 
check his version of his early career 
with her recollections. According to 
him it had been brilliance too much 
for his teachers to understand, until 
he had become impatient with them 

147 




and left the stupid school system 
forever. 

I moved to another universe. At 
eighty-five, the present must seem 
rather like a dream world. The real 
world, the world that matters, is 
mostly the past. Amelia Webster 
was sitting outside on a stone patio, 
looking out over a landscaped for- 
mal garden from a brightly colored 
reclining chair. I was led to her 
through the house and left to stand 
a few minutes inside while her 
companion went to her and told her 
about my arrival. 

The fading photographs on the 
side tables showed a woman in her 
twenties and thirties, black-haired 
and vivacious. No photographs after 
that. Amelia Webster, wisely, had 
frozen her recorded image at thirty- 
five. 

The bone structure and the alert 
dark eyes were still there, but ev- 
erything else had changed beyond 
recognition. Thomas Hardy said it 
exactly. ‘They must forget, forget! 
They cannot know what once they 
were, or memory would transfigure 
them and show them always fair.’ 

On that warm patio, sustained by 
endless cups of China tea from pale 
blue cups, we drifted for three 
hours, back and forth over eighty 
years. I didn’t hurry. Now and 
again we circled back to ‘young 
James,’ then away again to the 
Christmas Ball through the deep 
snow, the beloved killed in the 
Great War, to the first automobile 
ride. By five o’clock I knew the 



real Amelia Webster, passionate and 
sparkling, hidden inside the acci- 
dental husk of old age. And I had 
built a clear and disturbing picture 
of James Webster. 

‘Bad Blood.’ That was the omi- 
nous key phrase that Amelia had 
used. The other words? Glacially in- 
telligent. Selfish. Vain. Those are 
mine, not Amelia’s, but her longer 
descriptions added to produce the 
unpleasant summary. After high 
school James Webster had attended 
college for two years, then quit 
suddenly and returned to the family 
estate. There was a faint impression 
of something about his departure 
that would not be mentioned to 
anyone outside the family. I 
checked it later at the college and 
found well-disguised traces of a 
tragedy involving the death of a men- 
tally retarded girl. 

All this confirmed my own in- 
stinctive reaction. The central dis- 
covery from my meeting with 
Amelia was more tangible. James 
Webster maintained a study and 
complete recording studio in one 
wing of the house. For the past 
year, he had spent all his time there 
until he began his campaign. 

That night I drove back to At- 
lanta and again attended Webster’s 
rally. This time, I was determined 
to remain aloof and analyze his 
speech in objective terms. Can you 
believe me when I tell you I failed 
totally? The setting was just as be- 
fore, the simple outdoor meeting 
place, the soft music before he ap- 



148 



GALAXY 




peared. I made my notes about the 
audience, the lighting and the ex- 
pectant tension in the air. Then 
Webster began to speak and I was 
gone again. 

I returned to my senses and con- 
trol of my own body more than an 
hour later. 1 had been carried to 
great heights, shown the beauties of 
the world, dipped far into the fu- 
ture, offered happiness beyond 
belief — if I would help James 
Webster in his chosen works. 

Another sleepless night followed. 
Smoking and drinking like a fool, 
until the back of my throat was raw 
and my head spun when I lay back. 
But by morning I knew what I 
wanted to do. I made another ap- 
pointment with Amelia Webster and 
drove again to the big house with 
its long oak-shaded drive. The 
weather had broken and it was 
twenty degrees cooler, so today we 
remained inside. Lunch was served 
in a dining room big enough for 
thirty people. Amelia made sure 
that I was served enough for three 
meals but limited herself to soup, 
cheese and wine. Again, we talked 
our way here and there through the 
century, while I tried to refuse a 
succession of well-prepared dishes. 

With the coffee, Amelia Webster 
showed me what a mistake it would 
have been to underrate the mind in 
the fragile body. 

“Now, Mr. Forrest, that was 
very enjoyable. I don’t have too 
many interesting guests these days, 
you know. But why don’t you tell 

WHAT SONG THE SIRENS SANG 



me now what you came for.” She 
smiled. “I’m well aware that men 
no longer court me for myself 
alone. What do you want?” 

She was half-wrong, in my case, 
but half-right too. I shrugged my 
shoulders and smiled back at her. 

“Miss Amelia, I suspect that you 
know already.” 

“I think I do. It’s James’ studio, 
isn’t it? You were very polite yes- 
terday but I could see you almost 
sniffing the air when I mentioned it. 
You see, I’ve had the feeling for a 
long time that James has been up to 
something — and my instincts tell me 
that it’s not something that I’ll feel 
proud of.” 

She rose with difficulty from her 
chair and went slowly over to a 
large teak sideboard. 

“I don’t know why I should trust 
you this way, but that’s always a 
mystery. Here are the keys to the 
West Wing. The study and studio 
are on the second floor. James will 
not be back to the house until to- 
morrow evening. I ask one thing 
only, Mr. Forrest. Tell me nothing 
of what you find. Peace of mind is 
something I cherish these days.” 

Amelia Webster. A remarkable 
woman. We missed each other by 
about thirty-five years, and I’ve re- 
gretted it ever since. Perhaps the 
next time around. 

It was three o’clock when I took 
the keys from her and left the room. 
It was close to midnight when I 
climbed back into my rented car 
and began to drive back to Atlanta.

★ ★ ★ 

That was on March 19, 1980. If 
you look at the newspapers for 
that year, you will find that James 
Webster was murdered on the eve- 
ning of March 28th. Shot by an un- 
known assassin in the middle of an 
evening political rally. The shot was 
fired from a considerable distance 
using a high-powered rifle and a 
telescopic sight. 

No, I must correct that. The tele- 
scopic sight wasn’t in any of the 
news reports — they never found the 
rifle. 

I shot James Webster. I didn’t 
regret it then, and although the idea 
of murder for political ends appalls 
me, I have never regretted it since. 
In the eyes of the world, I might 
have been able to justify James 
Webster’s murder for good political 
reasons . 

But seen through those same 
eyes, I committed the greatest 
treason. I did the right deed for the 
wrong reason. 

Let me come now to the heart of 
it. 

It all boils down to this: what 
was it I found in Webster house? 
Well, what had I been expecting? It 
was hard to put a name to it, but 
mass hypnotism comes close. A 
‘hypnotic generator,’ maybe, that 
would allow one man to mesmerize 
a whole crowd. That was what was 
floating around in my mind. 

I found worse than that. First was 
Webster’s diary. Not for the past; 



for the future. Meticulously noted, 
day by day and meeting by meet- 
ing, the path to the Presidency of 
the United States. 

Five primaries, the convention, 
the television speeches, the pre- 
election addresses. 

Alone, that would have been 
nothing. Men have dreamed of 
power, and it is certain that many 
have made detailed plans to get it, 
but failed along the way. Webster 
would not have failed. What I 
found in his studio proved that. 

It took a while for me to put the 
pieces together. First there was the 
general theory. Three heavy black 
loose-leaf binders, full of mathema- 
tics and right over my head. Next to 
them I found a whole series of 
Webster ‘speeches.’ Each had a title 
and a date, running through the end 
of 1980. Inside the folder for each 
speech it looked like the score for a 
complicated opera, plus lots of 
added notation that I couldn’t fol- 
low. 

The words — I recognized some of 
them, from Webster’s speeches in 
Atlanta — had their own diacritical 
and pitch marks, above and below 
them. The music that went with 
them was precisely annotated as to 
volume, crescendi, diminuendi and 
instrumentation. 

On a desk in the comer I found 
another set of books. Famous 
speeches by Demosthenes, Cicero, 
William Jennings Bryan, Adolf Hit- 
ler and others. Each had numerous 
changes, added by Webster, plus 



150 



GALAXY 




again his strange ‘orchestration’ and 
added symbols. I finally realized 
that these were test pieces of Web- 
ster’s theory and techniques. 

The whole studio was packed 
with sophisticated recording equip- 
ment. Monitors for recording and 
varying pitch and intonation. Com- 
plex tape decks to permit multiple- 
track recordings, dubbing and splic- 
ing. Oscilloscopes to permit the 
display of wave forms, filters for 
signal processing, and signal syn- 
thesizers. I consider I know a fair 
amount about recording techniques 
but I was out of my depth. Webster 
had a couple of hundred thousand 
dollars worth of equipment in that 
single room. 

I might never have fathomed the 
mystery without Webster’s direct 
assistance. The key was in a thin 
blue book, over on the low table by 
the bricked-up fireplace of the 
studio. James Webster had kept a 
private log and diary for all his 
work. 

Perhaps everybody needs some- 
one to talk to — a Boswell, a 
Horatio, a wife or a confessor. 
James Webster had followed 
Samuel Pepys and used a private 
diary. 

From it I at last understood the 
true scope of his work, his ego and 
his ambition. 

James Webster, with his failings, 
was a genius. He had developed the 
basic theory of human communica- 
tion, the underlying eternal rules 
that govern human action and reac- 



tion. From that theoretical begin- 
ning, he had gone on to find the 
precise combinations of sounds that 
would stimulate a particular emo- 
tional response. It was an exact sci- 
ence. The calculations were long 
and complex and exact results hard 
to achieve, but Webster had de- 
veloped an ‘approximation theory’ 
that used combinations of English 
words and musical sounds to ap- 
proximate the mathematically opti- 
mal signals. 

His ‘speeches’ were approxima- 
tions of this type. As he said in his 
diary, “all the efforts of the great 
orators through history have been 
crude and intuitive attempts to do 
empirically and unreliably what I 
can now do with absolute assur- 
ance.” 

A great man could have found 
noble uses for his discoveries. 
Webster had no such objective. The 
pursuit of personal power, above 
and beyond any leader in history, 
was his ambition. 

Did I mention at the beginning 
that this is a confession? It is. Why 
didn’t I reveal Webster’s plans to 
the world and let society deal with 
him? Wouldn’t I have been re- 
garded as a hero, the man who 
saved the country (and the world) 
from an absolute dictatorship? Aye, 
there’s the rub. 

I told you I am appalled at the 
very idea of killing for political 
reasons. This is the simple truth. I 
shot Webster for different and more 
selfish reasons. 



WHAT SONG THE SIRENS SANG 



151 




To those people who have heard 
of me at all, I am a political writer. 
I have been one for so long that 
they cannot imagine me as anything 
else. But every harlot was a virgin 
once. Scratch a hack writer, and 
underneath you often find a poet. 
That’s me. Fifty years ago I decided 
that I had to earn a living and 
turned my back on poetry. Only the 
longing and the love lived on. 

When I left the Webster estate 
that night, so many years ago, I 
went to my hotel and I thought, 
long and painfully. I knew that all 
the great orators of the past had be- 
come fumbling amateurs, blindly 
stumbling towards Webster’s exact 
knowledge. 



But I knew more than that, much 
more. I thought of Keats, Col- 
eridge, Milton, Eliot and 
Wordsworth — of Shakespeare. Their 
words, long cherished, flooded my 
mind. And music. I heard the com- 
plex web of the final Rivercare of 
the ‘Musical Offering’ — the de pro- 
fundis opening of the Ring — the 
whirlwind and lightning finale of 
Schubert’s C Major Symphony. All 
now to be dismissed, discarded, 
crude approximations to a single at- 
tainable absolute. My world was to 
become obsolete. 

Take your fifty favorite pieces of 
music, your hundred best-loved 
poems . Imagine them gone from the 
world, swept away by a final and 
terrible progress. Now you know 
why I killed James Webster, or you 
will never know. ★ 





DIRECTIONS 



To: Jerry Pournelle 

I’ve waited two weeks since reading your 
article in the October issue of Galaxy regard- 
ing the prospects for Controlled Thermonu- 
clear Fusion (CTF) to write this letter. I’m 
writing this while flying home after attending 
the Second Topical Meeting on the Technol- 
ogy of Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion 
held in Richland, Washington Oct. 20-23, 
sponsored by ERDA, EPRI, and the Ameri- 
can Nuclear Society. 

Regarding the technical matters covered in 
your article, I have only two comments, re- 
garding the emphasis rather than the content 
of your article: 

1) In virtually all present concepts of the 
CTF reactor now being considered, the basic 
thermonuclear reaction utilized is the D-T 
reaction rather than the D-D reaction which 
you seemed to emphasize. This is primarily 
due to the much lower ignition energy (10 
KeV (10 8 °c) ) for D-T than the D-D reac- 
tion (100 KeV (10 9 °c) ) for a plasma power 
density of 10 watts/cm 3 . 

2) Since the D-T reaction will predomi- 
nate, a source of tritium is required to pro- 
vide fuel for the reactor. The amount of 
tritium occuring naturally is miniscule com- 
pared with deuterium, making recovery of 
natural tritium impracticable. The tritium will 
be therefore ‘bred' in the reactor coolant- 
breeder blanket by means of the reaction 

3 Li t 6 + qN 1 — l 1,3 + 2 He4 
3 Li + 0 N* — - 1 t3 + 2 h ® 4 + 0 N 1 

using the neutrons produced in the D-T 



plasma. The lithium in the blanket could 
serve the dual purpose of tritium breeder and 
reactor coolant to provide heat for a steam 
generator. The preliminary nature of CTF re- 
search is shown, however, by the fact that 
the chemical form of the lithium used for the 
reactor blanket has not yet been extensively 
specified. I received the impression at the 
conference that there is a general tendency to 
regard liquid elemental lithium as the likely 
candidate. Experience with the Liquid Metal 
Fast Breeder research shows, however, some 
of the major engineering, corrosion, and 
materials compatibility problems which can 
be expected from such an approach. In this 
context, Dr. S. Sze of the University of 
Wisconsin Fusion Study Group has de- 
veloped the idea of using a free-flowing 
lithium oxide (Li 2 0) microsphere bed for use 
as both reactor coolant and tritium breeder. 
This approach, if proven practical in terms of 
particle transport and steam generator re- 
quirements, could alleviate many of the 
major problems in CTF reactor blanket de- 
sign. 

Regarding more general matters in fusion 
research: 

Anyone working in CTF research would 
agree with you wholeheartedly regarding cau- 
tion over CTF as a miracle cure for future 
energy needs. Although plasma physicists 
have made steady progress in the physics of 
the thermonuclear reaction (both in magnetic 
and inertial confinement), truly massive en- 
gineering and materials problems remain. As 
a nuclear engineer I often cringed at some of 
the design parameters specified at some of 
the technical sessions. (30 x 10 6 BTU/hr.ft 2 
heat load on divertor plates, 10 Tesla magnet- 
ic fields, etc.), and .1 kept thinking, “How 
do they ever expect to get this thing 
licensed’}" It's early yet, but the point I 
would really like to make here is that even 
the most optimistic scenarios don’t envision 
CTF making any significant impact on our 
energy needs before the year 2010. Until that 
time, the huge investments necessary to de- 
velop CTF are just going to be a drain, 
perhaps a significant drain, on our economic 
resources without any significant payoff. 



DIRECTIONS 



153 




Also, the ability of our research to achieve a 
workable commercial CTF reactor depends 
largely on the health of our fission reactor 
economy. Many of the problems associated 
with developing a CTF reactor are the same 
kind of problems associated with fission 
reactors, and it is the present nuclear power 
industry, along with the research estab- 
lishments of the national labs and the univer- 
sities, who are going to have to provide the 
scientific and engineering manpower to solve 
these problems. The people who are going to 
tackle CTF development are going to have to 
be produced by the Nuclear Engineering de- 
partments of the universities and the size and 
existence of these departments depends on 
the state of the nuclear power industry. This 
may be an oversimplification, but 1 believe 
the general idea valid. If the light water fis- 
sion reactor industry is destroyed by the 
specious obstructionism which now confronts 
it, our energy economy may not be able to 
achieve a commercial CTF reactor within a 
time period sufficient to help meet future 
needs. As it is, it’s going to be touch and 
go. In short, regarding fusion power as any 
kind of short-term (50 years) alternative to 
fission power for meeting our energy needs 
is wishful thinking, as are, in my opinion 
solar, geothermal, hydroelectric (deadly 
dams!!) etc. power. Besides, we don’t worry 
about the ecological effects of these power 
sources on a large scale because nobody has 
really studied them yet. 

Enough, I’m getting a little queasy. If man 
were meant to fly. .etc.

Jerry’ s reply: 

The environmentalists were horrified at the 
thought of all that liquid sodium in the 
Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (Fission); 
what will they say to liquid Lithium, and 



breeding nasty Tritium as well ? 

I suspect that as soon as Fusion becomes 
somewhere near practical, the “ecologists” 
and “environmental protectors” and “ con- 
cerned scientists” who are now so 
thoroughly in favor of fusion that they wish 
us to defer all new power plant construction 
until fusion is available will, suddenly, be- 
come enemies of fusion; God alone knows 
what they will be for then . 

“But this be law, l will maintain, until my 
dying day, Sir; that whatsoever king shall 
reign, still I’ll be Vicar of Brae, Sir.” (See 
also Inferno, 2nd round, 7th circle.) 

My thanks to Dr. Thornton for his kind 
comments and additions to my article on Fu- 
sion without Exlax. 

Mr. Baen: 

I have grown tired of seeing J. Pournelle’s 
articles gushing about the wonders of atomic 
fission/fusion/etc. There are severe objections 
to atomic fission (I haven’t seen any solution 
to where we’ll put the waste from Pournel- 
le’s office, to give just one example), and 
atomic fusion is still some distance in the fu- 
ture and thus not to be relied on. 

I am also tired of helping pay for such ar- 
ticles every time I buy an issue of 
GALAXY. 

In short, how about equal time? I’m sure 
some of the physicists who donated their 
time to California’s Proposition 14 would be 
glad to counter Pournelle's assertions, and 
presenting both sides would give your read- 
ers a more balanced treatment of the subject. 
Currently, all they’re getting is the assertion 
that objections to nuclear power are based on 
“superstition,” which is not the case. 

Sincerely,

I would be happy to consider for publication 
an article such as you propose. .of course 
as Science Editor Dr. Pournelle would have 
the right of rebuttal in the same issue. Any

GALAXY 




Dear Mr. Baen, 

I would like to enter one vote in Alter’s 
favor in the election suggested by him in The 
Alien Viewpoint in your October issue of 
Galaxy . 

I would also like to express my apprecia- 
tion of John Varley’s work, which I have en- 
joyed greatly. But I do have a question about 
it: “Phantom of Kansas’’ and “Overdrawn at 
the Memory Bank’’ both take place in the 
same general setting — future settlements on 
the moon, as does “Bagatelle”, but 
“Bagatelle” has no reference to the depopu- 
lated Invader-controlled Earth described in 
“Kansas”, quite the contrary. Are they or 
are they not parts of the same line of “future 
history”? And what relation does the space- 
time setting of “Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance” 
bear to all this? 

I have enjoyed all the stories which I have 
read in Galaxy since the Jan. 1975 issue, 
which was the first I purchased (following 
the demise of IF). I have six 1975 issues and 
seven 1976 issues, acquired by watching 
newsstand shelves like a hawk. 1 can tell by 
the continued stories that I have missed less 
than nine issues, but the uncertainty of 
whether you are publishing monthly or 
bimonthly or whatever is driving me crazy, 
so I’m going to take up your silver anniver- 
sary offer as indicated on page four. As a 
librarian I am morally outraged by the 
thought of mutilating any printed work, even 
one which belongs to me, so I am not send- 
ing you your little coupon from page four. 
I'm sending a hand- written copy of it to the 
address given on the coupon itself. I hope 
this doesn’t snarl up your bookkeeping too 
much. 

On to other affairs: Tell Mr. Zelazny to 
hurry up and finish the Amber series, 
please !! Also, in your February 1975 issue 
you asked, after the last letter in Directions 
which referred to Poul Anderson’s work in- 
cluding the Flandry stories, “Is there a fu- 
ture for the Race, after the Empire? I mean 
with the damn Merseians just waiting their 
chance, and all. .Well, Poul?” Please ask 
him again. Louder. 

And congratulate Mr. Niven on his present 



story and suggest that he and Mr. Poumelle 
consider doing a Purgatorio. 

What are Hal Clement and Gordon 
Dickson doing lately? Didn’t the Dorsai 
series originally include a couple more 
novels in the original plan? 

I know from personal experience that even 
a lousy writer can’t ever stop writing and 
making up stories, and I haven’t seen any 
obituaries on a lot of the great writers in the 
field, so where are they? I realize that not 
everyone is an Asimov, but they can’t expect 
people who only became old enough to ap- 
preciate SF ten years ago to be placated by 
reprints from the fifties and early sixties 
forever; SF doesn’t have quite the obsoles- 
cence problem of hard science, but it does 
date. And even the reprints aren’t numerous 
enough. As a twenty-two year old SF addict 
I feel sadly put upon.

Varley replies: 

“ Phantom ” and “ Overdrawn ” are both 
parts of what I’ve started to call my Eight 
Worlds series of stories. You’ re right in 
thinking that BAGATELLE doesn’t fit in. It’s 
from an altogether uglier future, and one 
that I’m unlikely to return to for a second 
story. In the Eight Worlds series, the Inva- 
sion of Earth took place in 2050, and most 
of the stories are set three to four hundred 
years later. Everyone in them is descended 
from a moon colony of about ten thousand 
people which was not affected by the Inva- 
sion . 

GOTTA SING, GOTTA DANCE is also a 
part of the Eight Worlds series, but the Rings 
are not one of the Eight Worlds. Those are 
Mercury, Venus, Luna, Mars, Titan, Oberon, 
Triton, and Pluto. The Ring society does not 
interact much with the rest of humanity. 

Best, 
John Varley

favor of the emancipation, liberation and 
publication of Alter Ego. But I suspect I may 
stray from that subject, since I have just 
exhausted it. 

I want to compliment you on the bal- 
ance you maintain in Galaxy. The non-fiction 
departments are particularly outstanding. 
Spider Robinson is the most useful, and in 
many ways the best, book reviewer. Dr. 
Pournelle is also the best — in some ways — 
writer of science columns in sf magazines. (I 
don’t have anything against Asimov, it’s just 
that he concentrates primarily on what has 
been or what is; Pournelle places more em- 
phasis on what might be.) And Alter, being 
rather a unique specimen, is by definition 
unrivalled. 

Wishful thinking. Jerry Pournelle has in 
the course of writing his columns turned me 
on to certain non-fiction books which I’ve 
found very rewarding. (He also turned me off 
of one, which I suspect was an equal ser- 
vice.) Being an alleged sf writer myself may 
have something to do with my enjoyment of 
and need for such books (G. Harry Stine and 
Stephen Dole especially) but I find my ap- 
preciation as a reader enhanced. The wish I 
referred to is for an occasional column or 
listing of non-fiction material of particular 
interest to readers & writers of sf. It only 
sounds drab. I actually enjoyed Asimov’s 
The Noble Gases, but I stumbled on it by 
chance. And then there are the books by 
Carl Sagan. Beautiful. Is such a wish even 
realistic, though? How many sfers really 
wonder about that sort of thing? I know there 
is at least one.

Dear Jim, 

First: I wouldn’t have written just to vote 
on the Geis/Alter schtik; I kind of like the 
brouhaha as is. Both of ’em, hammer and 
tongs. If that’s legitimate, so be it. 

Second: the Spider encourages all Readers 
to vote for the Hugos. Write on. But there’s 



something more we in the science-fiction 
field should be doing, could be doing, in- 
stead of moaning ‘why isn’t there interest in 
space research’ and ‘why do they only pub- 
lish books on space when Viking is about to 
land on Mars.’ 

The suggestion is to be found in SCI- 
ENCE NEWS, 25 Sept. 76 issue, page 199 
(numbered cumulatively; it’s not a heavy 
mag) in a short article about the upcoming 
space shuttle which is to be named “Enter- 
prise.” Guess why? Because 60,000 Trek- 
kies wrote in to NASA and suggested that 
should be the name. 

As the article points out, the name is not 
the most important thing. The important 
thing is that when 60,000 people (or even 
10,000) write in and demand something, at- 
tention is paid to them. 

Why aren’t we writing? Why aren’t we 
demanding more research, more utilization of 
our space efforts, and the resources we are 
rapidly losing in trained scientists and func- 
tioning laboratories, and so forth? They are 
being absorbed into other industries; they can 
hardly go on the breadline waiting for more 
work in their chosen field if NASA — or 
some agency — fails to employ them. Why do 
we let authoritative writers like Patrick 
Moore blandly assert, as he did in The Next 
Fifty Years in Space that satellite technology 
is not being used for the convenience and 
needs of ordinary people? (His statement in- 
ferred that communications satellites did not 
carry telephone conversations; a misstatement 
then and now. After all, the book carries a 
1976 date.) For him, space research is about 
dead. 

Why are we so willing to complain among 
ourselves and not on paper, to the proper au- 
thorities? 

Why do we — space buffs, that is — only 
get a ‘good press’ when something spectacu- 
lar is going on? Why aren’t we out there in 
front, demanding it? 

How about it, Dr. Pournelle — you’ve 
suggested one project, the electron bom- 
bardment, inertial confinement fusion project 
at Sandia. We’ve all got congressmen. I’m 
willing to write mine. Got some more ideas,

Trouble is, really good ideas aren’t all that 
common . 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I was happy to see your October issue. 
The departments were interesting, as usual. 
“The Alien Viewpoint” is definitely a plus. 
(By the way, I vote for Alter-Ego, because 
Geis has enough to say in Science Fiction 
Review, and Alter is the more interesting of 
the two). Your book review column is also 
very good, with Spider Robinson being one 
of the better reviewers around today, and 
your art selections are breathtaking. I’m 
starting to think that Fabian is the best artist 
in SF today. 

But the most surprising thing about the 
issue was the Fiction. I usually save all the 
short fiction for the last three months of the 
year, and then read it all at once. This year 
the October issue of Galaxy was the first 
magazine I read all year. The two Novel- 
lettes were very well done. Varley is very 
quickly becoming the best new writer 
around, and “Bagatelle” was very good, in 
spite of the predictable ending. “Seeker of 
the way” on the other hand- was good 
throughout. I would like to know if Mr. 
Schmidt has been published before and 
where? The Niven serial was as usual com- 
petent, but the short stories were pretty dis- 
mal. “You’ll be a real sensation”, and “The 
man at the bottom of the Sea” were unread- 
able, and R.C. Walkers “Act of faith” was 
a good Idea lacking in the execution. 

But what actually prompted me to write 
was Thomas J. Mum’s letter. When he 
quoted Chip Delany’s essay “About 5,175 
words” in defense of “Dhalgren”, which is 
full of “unintentional confusion, ambiguity, 
and shallow action”, it was just too much 
for me to bear. Now, 1 am not a “dinosaur” 
who reads nothing but “the sterile space- 
poop of the Laser books”, but a genuine 



New-Wave fan from back when it was the 
new wave (which Delany was never a part 
of), and I still say that Dhalgren is preten- 
tious garbage. Dhalgren would have been 
fairly interesting as a novella (say about 
25,000 words), but as it stands it is boring 
with a Capital B, and unreadable, and if I want 
to read literature, or whatever it is Dhalgren 
is supposed to be I’ll read “Finnegan’s 
Wake”, which Dhalgren is a tenth rate imita- 
tion of. 

I think that Chip Delany has gotten into 
the same type of thing that Ballard got into 
back in 1969 with “The Atrocity Exhibi- 
tion”, except that Delany’s writing got so 
fat, and gluttonous, while Ballard's writing 
got so lean and compressed. But the effect 
was the same, they both got unintelligible 
and boring. But Ballard has now come back 
with “Crash”, and “High-Rise”, both 
books being Classics of Speculative Fiction 
(Not SF, Ballard hasn’t been a SF writer for 
many years). 

In the long run I think that Delany will 
soon come back to the SF mainstream, and 
grace us with stories like “The Star-Pit”, 
and “The Einstein Intersection”, and leave 
the pretentiousness and gluttony of Dhal- 
gren and Triton behind. 

One point Mr. Murn does make in his let- 
ter is that Dhalgren is very enjoyable, and 
accesible to High Schoolers, as would be 
any long novel with lots of clinical sex and a 
nameless hero, set in a city where “law and 
order” have ceased to exist, where everyone 
can do as they please; and they would also 
like a book which at the same time, attempts 
to be great literature, all of which Dhalgren 
has. 

I once thought that Chip Delany, and 
Roger Zelazny were going to bring about a 
new “Golden Age” in SF, but I guess I’ll 
have to wait a little longer, because neither 
one of these gentlemen seems to be bringing 
this about. 

Yours truly

DIRECTIONS

Dear Mr. Baen, 

In starting, I must mention that getting 
your magazine was almost a total accident. 
In Fall ’75, I was relatively uninitiated in the 
science fiction genre. I started out with 
STAR TREK (no groans, please), and had 
progressed to a few selected short stories. 
My sister’s school had a fund raising drive 
selling subscriptions to magazines. To help 
her out I bought a subscription to your 
magazine somehow thinking (horror of all 
horrors) that it was that other sf magazine 
that has six letters. At that time I had only 
read that other magazine and thought that it 
was a typical (and only) example of an sf 
magazine. When I realized that you were not 
Analog, I was worried that you were some 
slip- shod operation. What a happy surprise it 
was when I received my First issue! 

I find your features unbeatable, with Mes- 
sieurs Robinson and Geis vying for first at- 
tention, although Alter usually wins out for 
top honors. I find Dr. Pournelle extremely 
lucid and he is always relevant to the events 
of today — and those of tomorrow. 

Your stories are tough to beat, also. I par- 
ticularly enjoyed “Abandon All Heat, Ye 
Who Enter Here’’, and “The Children of the 
State” promises well. Galaxy Continues to 
take the lead in true Science Fiction. 

My one complaint is that I want to hear 
more of you, Mr. Baen, in some editorials 
and some news about the condition of the sf 
magazine market. 

Sincerely yours, 
Thomas Koegel 

4022 Chestnut Avenue 
Long Beach, Ca. 90807 

Your last point is, / fear, well taken. In miti- 
gation / can only offer that the need for 
monthly editorials is the. .er. .bane of 
harrassed editors. .Perhaps / have been 
overly demanding of myself in terms of to- 
pics. / hereby resolve (as I have before ) to 
Do Better. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I’m going to be greedy and say that I want 
both Geis and Alter. My reasoning is simple: 



they balance each other. Without Geis, Al- 
ter’ s ranting would just get on my nerves, 
while with no Alter the column wouldn’t be 
quite as interesting. The one thing that both 
of them prefer to overlook is that neither of 
them would be where they are today without 
the other. They’re a team , dammit, and 
that’s what I want to see. 

Lee Ann Goldstein

Dick will remain, though his role will 
be. .altered! 

Dear Jim, 

Up with Alter Ego! 

Down with Geis! 

You know these multiple personality 
cases, though few, can be very interesting. 
I’m just waiting for the Geis personality to 
disappear so that Alter can begin to contend 
with that even weirder personality to come. 
Over the year Galaxy might proceed through 
an entire gamut of alien critics culminating 
with one that takes over your job — and then 
what of Galaxy ? 

Sincerely, 
John Robinson 

1 -101st Street 
Troy, NY 12180 

What, indeed! 

Geis’ s vote: 

Dear Jim, 

To help resolve the conflict of interests be- 
tween Dick Geis and Alter in “The Alien 
Viewpoint” controversy, let me put my vote 
in favor of Dick. Sure, I love Alter as well, 
but the “Prime Selves” must be maintained. 

(No name given) 



The final tally: Alter, 85%: Geis, .05%: 
Both, 13.5%: Other, 1%. And thus ends one 
of the most lopsided contests in modern elec- 
toral history. For further information see next 
month' s Alien Viewpoint — by Alter Ego!
