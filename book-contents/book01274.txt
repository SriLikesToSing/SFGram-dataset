The odds against being found out were 21 ^ billion to 
one — and Vee was camouflaged to the very last hair! 

I T’S not so that two things crumpled, disorganized mess 
can’t occupy the same space coasting on aimlessly through 
at the same time. Certainly space, and for the 192 passen- 
they can. gers, with a single exception, 

Of course, it doesn’t do to become quite dead, 
either of them any good. Like all such disasters, it 

It took only seven seconds shouldn’t have happened. It

tiful spaceship to become a But safety devices have al-

ways had one peculiarity. 
They function perfectly on 
test; and when it isn’t a test, 
but the real thing, they often 
don’t function at all. 

In this case, despite all the 
safety devices, the Vigintan 
ship inserted herself into 
normal space in the middle 
of a vast cloud of nebulous 
matter. 

There were seven seconds 
of hell. 

Afterward, what was left 
of the ship careered on, life 
casually deleted from it, lines 
twisted to grotesque deform- 
ity, all power and purpose in 
the giant engines blasted to 
absurdity. 

A few of the passengers 
had had two or three seconds 
knowledge of disaster. Half 
a dozen had seven seconds of 
terror and helplessness and 
agony. 

Only one had five seconds 
grace and was able to make 
use of it. 

Vee was in the long outer 
passage on her way to the 
control room when it happen- 
ed. 

She was actually passing 
the open port of one of the 
lifeboat shells. At the first 
screaming, tearing intima- 
tions of mortal agony in the 
ship, she dived into the shell 
and pulled the emergency 
black handle. The tiny life- 
boat slid shut with two 
seconds to spare, cast itself 
loose and scuttled away des- 
perately from the parent ship. 



W ITHIN a few minutes 
Vee knew from the blank 
silence of the radio that she 
was the sole survivor. Am was 
dead. 

Her grief twisted her in 
knots. To a member of Vee’s 
race, the death of a husband 
or wife was like . no, hu- 
mans could never understand 
it. 

Suppose a woman, watch- 
ing, saw her husband, her 
three children and her mother 
and father die. Suppose in the 
same catastrophe all her 
friends, everybody who spoke 
her language, her native coun- 
try and everything in it were 
obliterated. 

That woman might feel as 
Vee felt at the death of Am. 

But Vee had to go on liv- 
ing, if she could. She had 
much the same instinct of 
self-preservation as humans 
had, although Vee was not 
human. The fact that she 
didn’t want to live was ir- 
relevant. 

She tried, unsuccessfully to 
face the near certainty that 
whether she survived a hun- 
dred seconds or a hundred 
years more, she would never 
see any of her own kind 
again. 

Over the vast distances of 
the Galaxy, radio was less 
useful, less reliable, than a 
bottle thrown in the sea on the 
wrong world. When a ship 
was wrecked, there wasn’t a 
chance of a survivor ever be- 
ing found. Hyperspace travel 



6 



j. t. McIntosh 




was the only way to cross 
vast distances in a small frac- 
tion of a lifetime, and hyper- 
space travel was, by definition, 
a shorter distance between 
two points than a straight 
line. 

At least you could search 
along a straight line. You 
couldn’t search along a hyper- 
space route. 

The one faint chance Vee 
had of ever seeing her home 
world again — negligible, but 
far greater than the chance 
of being picked up by a res- 
cue ship — was finding some 
world where the inhabitants 
were approaching the starship 
stage of development. 

Automatically the tiny life- 
boat, so small that she could 
hardly change her position in 
it, was homing on the nearest 
world on which she might 
conceivably live. There was 
never any guarantee that 
there would be one within 
the light-year which was the 
boat’s extreme limit; in fact, 
it was most unlikely. 

However, Vee’s lifeboat was 
already moving purposefully. 
The scanners had found some- 
thing. 

Without further delay, Vee 
threw the switch which would 
keep her in suspended anima- 
tion until the boat reached 
its destination. There was 
nothing for her to do. The 
boat’s electronic eyes had 
found a world on which it 
might be possible for her to 
survive. All she could do was 



go there and find out whether 
it was possible or not — by 
living or dying. 

“T WANT to know the truth, 
1 Bill,” said Walt. 

Dr. McEwan ran a hand 
through his five remaining 
hairs. “I wonder why people 
always want to know the 
worst, and won’t be satisfied 
till they get it. I’ve told you 
there’s nothing to worry 
about. You won’t believe me. 
Obviously you’re not going to 
believe anything except — ” 
“Bill, you ought to know me 
by this time,” said Walt. 
“The one thing I can’t take 
is uncertainty.” 

“There’s no uncertainty ! 
Sure, you may be smashed to 
pieces by a truck as you leave 
this office, but apart from that 
there’s no particular reason 
why you shouldn’t live an- 
other fifty years or so.” 

“Bill, I’ve played poker 
with you. You always lose be- 
cause you can’t bluff. Listen. 
I know it’s right to conceal 
things from some people. 
Even if they beg you to tell 
them the truth, all they really 
want is reassurance. I’m dif- 
ferent. I want to plan my life 
knowing I’m going to have 
it for a while, or knowing the 
other thing. Remember, Bill, 
it’s me, Walt Rinker, you’re 
talking to. Not somebody you 
know nothing about. I’m ask- 
ing you as a friend. I want 
you to tell me as a friend.” 
“All right,” said Dr. Mc-

IN A BODY 




Ewan after a pause. “It’s 
leukemia. You’re going to 
die.” 

Walt nodded quite calmly. 
“I knew it. How long have I 
got?” 

“A year maybe.” 

Walt took a deep breath. 
“Well, that’s a long time. 
Couple of hundred people in 
town are going to die before 
me. I’m pretty high on the 
list, but nowhere near the top. 
There’s no chance. Bill? No 
treatment?” 

“There’s X-ray treatment 
that sometimes helps. But you 
asked me as a friend, Bill — 
if it were me, I wouldn’t 
spend all my money and the 
rest of my time hanging 
around hospitals and dying 
anyway.” 

“Me neither. How long have 
I got more or less as I am 
now?” 

The truth was too brutal. 
The blood count and the num- 
ber of immature white cells 
present showed that the 
disease was already acute. In 
other words, although Walt 
was thin and in anything but 
glowing health now, he would 
never again be in as good 
shape as he was at present. 

“Six months, perhaps,” Mc- 
Ewan said. 

There was silence for a 
moment. Then Walt said: 
“Thanks for telling me, Bill.” 

J ANET looked particularly 
desirable that night, her 
light tan wonderfully set off 



by her white dress. She was 
a small, slim, one-hundred- 
per-cent-feminine brunette. 
No tomboy or tough, athletic, 
wise-cracking sex-bomb, Jan- 
et. She was eleven years 
younger than Walt and be- 
lieved that a man ought to 
be master in his home. 

She was so desirable that 
Walt resolved never to see her 
again. 

Sure, she loved him. Sure, 
they could have been happy. 
Sure, she wasn’t going to like 
what he was going to say. 

But a broken romance at 
nineteen wasn’t the end of 
the world, even though it 
would seem so at the time. 
It certainly wasn’t as bad as 
being widowed at twenty, af- 
ter spending six months 
watching the man you loved 
die. 

“Honey,” he said, “hang on- 
to something. I’m going to 
kick you in the guts.” 

Her bright smile faded and 
tears filled her eyes. “So you 
know,” she said. 

“Mean you know, too? 
How?” 

“Never mind. Did Dr. Mc- 
Ewan tell you?” 

“I made him.” 

“He shouldn’t have told 
you.” 

“By God, he should!” said 
Walt with sudden force. “This 
was the kind of thing I was 
afraid of, the kind of thing 
I was trying to avoid.” 

“What kind of thing?” 
“Everybody knowing all 



8 



j. t. McIntosh 




about it but me. People I 
don’t like suddenly being nice 
to me. Me making plans and 
people humoring me, know- 
ing I wasn’t going to be 
around to follow through. 
Everybody thinking : ‘I’m not 
going to be the one to tell 
him.’ ” 

“Walt, what good does it 
do, your knowing that — ” 

He interrupted her impati- 
ently. “That wasn’t all, Janet. 
It doesn’t matter any more, 
now that I know. What I was 
going to say was — I don’t 
think we’d better see each 
other again after tonight.” 

She was hurt, frightened. 
She seemed to shrink. “That’s 
certainly a dirty one,” she 
whispered. “I wanted ... I 
hoped ... I thought we’d get 
married and have a little 
while — ” 

He shook his head decisive- 
ly. “I can’t do it, Janet. I 
want us to break here and 
now. It’ll hurt you if we never 
see each other again after to- 
night, but it would hurt a 
hell of a lot more if we got 
married and I died just about 
the time our first kid would 
be born.” 

“Walt, you haven’t had time 
to think about this. Can’t you 
see, this is all the more reason 
for us to get married right 
away? Women get married in 
wartime, have a forty-eight- 
hour honeymoon, and often 
never see their husbands 
again. I — ” 

“For one thing,” said Walt- 



er drily, “people who do that 
are fools. For another, fools 
though they are, they’re at 
least planning for the future. 
The men don’t expect to die. 
Marriage is planning, Janet. 
It isn’t diving into bed to- 
gether today, because tomor- 
row it may not seem such a 
good idea. It’s meant to be — ” 
“Forget what it’s meant to 
be!” said Janet vehemently. 
“We can’t plan for fifty years 
together, maybe. Some mar- 
riages don’t last a year any- 
way.” 

“I’m not going to marry 
you knowing — ” 

“Then we won’t get mar- 
ried. I don’t care about mar- 
riage. If you don’t want to get 
married with this hanging 
over you, I’ll move in with 
you anyway.” 

“What’s your mother going 
to say about that?” 

“What my mother says 
doesn’t matter !” 

Walt stood up. “Honey, the 
longer we go on, the worse 
it gets. I guess I’d better go. 
Forget me as soon as you 
can.” 

Shutting his ears to her 
cry, he strode out without a 
glance over his shoulder. 

T HE FACT that Vee woke 
at all showed that the 
landing had been success- 
ful and that conditions on the 
planet she had landed on were 
not entirely impossible. 

But there was something 
of at least equal importance 



IN A BODY

to be settled before she could 
think of going on living. 

She threw the radio’s net 
wide and switched on. 

To her astonishment, she 
was almost blasted out of her 
tiny cell. There was more 
radio communication of more 
kinds on this world than on 
any she knew. 

This, then, was a civilized 
world. 

She didn’t know whether to 
be glad or sorry. 

For a while she thought of 
Am, drawing a little strength 
even from the memory of him. 
He would want her to find 
another soulmate, for he 
would want her to live. They 
had had no children, being 
spacebound. Am would want 
her to find another soulmate, 
because only if she did so 
could anything of him sur- 
vive. 

Vigintans needed compan- 
ionship as they needed food 
and water. Almost as neces- 
sary as simple companionship 
was a soulmate. Not just a 
friend, not just a lover, but 
a spouse so close physically, 
mentally and spiritually that 
nothing divided them, nothing 
remained to divide them. Only 
with such a soulmate could 
any Vigintan approach hap- 
piness. 

For hours Vee listened to 
the radio, concentrating with 
every cell in her mind on 
learning all she could of the 
people of this world. Soon, 
somehow, she must be able to 



pass among them as one of 
themselves, no matter what 
they looked like. 

As an alien you could be 
liked, you could be respected, 
you could even be revered. 
But you couldn’t be loved. 

So Vee had to become a hu- 
man, down to the last physical 
decimal point, so human that 
she could reproduce as hu- 
mans did, so human that it 
could never occur to anybody 
that she had ever been any- 
thing else. 

That, for her, was quite 
possible. 

Though she was no techni- 
cian, the cathode tube was set 
up so that even uninformed 
fiddling would eventually try 
every possible adjustment, 
and at last she began to get 
television pictures. 

F ROM then on, progress 
was easy. Even before she 
had any idea how these crea- 
tures who called themselves 
men and women were formed 
under their curiously elastic 
skins, she had begun to 
change her appearance to con- 
form with theirs. 

It was fortunate, Vee 
thought, that she was a wo- 
man. Many hours of watching 
TV gave her little or no in- 
formation on the anatomy of 
the males, but provided a 
great deal about the anatomy 
of females. She saw chorines' 
legs flashing in so many rou- 
tines that she was able to 
work out in detail exactly 



10 



j. t. McIntosh 




what the relevant bone and 
muscle structure must be, and 
set to work immediately to 
reproduce it. An acrobat in 
a costume which covered only 
the primary and secondary 
characteristics showed Vee 
the entire bone structure of 
the feminine torso, and she 
made good use of the informa- 
tion. 

Certain details would have 
to wait, of course. A visit to 
a library — once she could 
read — would probably fill in 
most of the gaps left by tele- 
vision. 

Meantime she had enough 
to do learning the language 
and customs of these creatures 
and modifying her body. She 
would look and sound like a 
human female long before she 
really was one. 

At night, when most trans- 
missions ceased, she turned to 
another problem — where her 
ship had landed, and what she 
was to use for food. 

In accordance with stand- 
ard practice, the lifeboat had 
buried itself in soft ground 
and pulled the hole in after 
itself. Digging her way to the 
surface — though her trans- 
formation had begun, she was 
still well equipped for digging 
— Vee found to her delighted 
amazement that she was right 
in the middle of the richest 
larder imaginable, covered by 
it, hidden by it. She could eat 
almost every form of vegeta- 
tion, and she was in thick 
undergrowth which already 



had swung back to conceal the 
passage of her tiny ship. 

Collecting enough leaves to 
last her for several days, she 
returned to her ship, reflect- 
ing that the only food difficul- 
ties were going to be when she 
was nearly human and could 
no longer live on leaves, and 
would need much more air 
than she normally required. 

However, that wouldn't be 
for some days yet. 

N EXT day, when radio 
transmission started, she 
was again busy. 

Vigintans, like humans, had 
enormously high potential 
when all their interests were 
at stake. Under the stress of 
dire necessity, a man who 
isn’t particularly brave, skill- 
ful or intelligent will often do 
things which are well beyond 
his normal capacity. Vee, like- 
wise, was able to employ sev- 
eral times her normal capac- 
ity in learning from radio and 
TV, making the necessary de- 
ductions and applying the re- 
sults. 

The finer points of the 
psychology of these humans 
were beyond her and might al- 
ways be. But on the whole 
they were decent enough 
people, and, after all, among 
all civilized races the funda- 
mental principle of coopera- 
tion was the same — I'll do 
what you want if you do what 
I want. 

In fact, these humans even 
put it in the form of a maxim : 



IN A BODY 



11 




You scrateh my back and I'll 
scratch yours. 

No, Vee didn’t anticipate 
any real trouble in dealing 
with them and getting what 
she wanted. 

What she needed. 

A S WALT came out into 
the street, he heard his 
name called. He turned before 
he realized it would have been 
much more sensible to pay no 
attention. 

In the car by the curb was 
Janet. 

“Look, Janet,” he said. “I 
told you — ” 

“Do you have to go there?” 
she said bitterly. “Don’t you 
know that if you’ve got to 
have a woman, I’m waiting?” 
He straightened and would 
have walked on. 

“I’ll drive after you,” she 
said, “calling your name. Get 
in and talk to me.” 

He hesitated, then got in 
beside her. Janet was showing 
far more guts and persistence 
and determination than he 
had ever believed her capable 
of — and he wished she 

wouldn’t. 

“Janet,” he said, “I was 
right. I’m as good as dead. 
Why can’t you just tell your- 
self I’m dead now?” 

“Walt, I don’t think you 
know what love is. What kind 
of a girl would walk out on 
her man when he needs her 
most?” 

“I don’t need you. If we’d 
been married, you’d have 

12 



stood by me. I know that. I’d 
have expected it. But it’s 
crazy to go on when there’s 
no future for us. Find some 
other guy. Do it now, instead 
of waiting till they actually 
screw the lid down on me.” 
“Until you find some other 
girl, I won’t leave you.” 
“There isn’t going to be any 
other girl. Why should I try 
to make somebody else miser- 
able because I’m going to die? 
All I want is — ” 

“To make a martyr of your- 
self. To give up everything so 
that you die with nothing, 
with nobody caring about you, 
so that you can feel sorry 
for yourself and say, ‘Look 
how cruel fate has been to 
me.’ ” 

“It’s not like that at all. 
I just want to tie up some 
loose ends.” 

“Walt, you’re wrong, your 
whole attitude’s wrong. The 
natural, the right thing for a 
man to do is begin new things 
till the day he dies.” 

“Let’s not get started on 
that again, Janet.” 

“If you think it’s wrong to 
come to me, what’s so damned 
right about going to a woman 
like that?” 

“I can’t hurt her,” said 
Walt patiently. “She’s forgot- 
ten me already. It was just a 
business transaction.” 

“And knowing you’re going 
to a place like that is supposed 
to make me wild with joy?” 
“You’re not supposed to 
know anything about me. 



J. T. MclNTOSH 




You're supposed to forget you 
ever knew me.” 

She was silent for a mo- 
ment. Then she said: “I’ll 
drive you home. I’m not 
strong really, Walt. I can’t 
keep up an argument for long. 
I have to wait for a while 
before I have strength to start 
it again.” 

“Then why start it, 
honey?” 

She began to cry quietly, 
helplessly. It took all Walt’s 
self-control to stop himself 
from taking her in his arms, 
but he succeeded. 

Presently, blinking hard, 
she started the motor and put 
the car in gear. 

I T WAS three o’clock in the 
morning, and apart from 
the soft, rustling sounds of 
the country at night, all was 
still. But down in the forest 
something stirred. 

It was an approximate girl 
who weighed 118 pounds, was 
five feet six inches tall, 
blonde, and 38, 23, 37. 

It was Vee. 

She had no intention of 
being seen by anyone this 
trip. 

Apart from lack of clothes, 
she didn’t expect to pass as 
a normal human female yet. 
One difficulty was color. Tele- 
vision didn’t show whether 
her skin should be gray, pale 
yellow, blue, green or pink. 

By the time she returned 
to her lifeboat, before dawn, 
she hoped to have clothing, 



money, and most of the bio- 
logical information she still 
lacked. She had no special ad- 
vantages except her Vigintan 
warning instinct, which was 
better than the human vari- 
ety. In addition to hearing, 
sight and smell, she had a 
kind of crude telepathy which 
enabled her to place accurate- 
ly — even with her eyes closed 
— all living intelligences with- 
in two or three hundred 
yards. 

The night was warm and 
strongly moonlit. Vee had 
chosen a moonlit night be- 
cause her night vision was 
no better than any human's, 
and it was no good avoiding 
being seen by picking a night 
so dark that she couldn’t see 
either. 

She liked her human body, 
which was more mobile and 
nearly as tough as the one 
it had replaced. Clothes were 
a necessity, however, she 
soon discovered, shivering 
despite the exercise of walk- 
ing. Shoes of some kind were 
even more necessary than 
clothes, for although grass 
did her tender soles no harm, 
stones and twigs underfoot 
hurt them and made her pick 
her route with care. 

A dog came up to her 
silently. Masking her fear, she 
radiated strong reassurance. 

To her relief, the dog was 
so completely satisfied that he 
lost interest, loping off as 
silently as he came. Vee was 
pleased as well as relieved. 



IN A BODY 



13 




She knew from radio and TV 
that dogs did a good deal of 
their investigation with their 
noses, and from the indiffer- 
ence of this dog it was ob- 
vious that her body scent 
must be normal. This wasn’t 
surprising, since her metabo- 
lism was now entirely human, 
even if all the details were 
not quite settled. She was liv- 
ing on fruit, berries, nuts and 
vegetables. 

It didn’t bother the dog 
that she had no clothes on. 

Presently she found a road 
by seeing the headlights of a 
car on it. A road must lead 
somewhere, and a few min- 
utes of patient waiting satis- 
fied her that it was safe to 
walk on it. If only one car 
passed in twenty minutes, it 
could hardly be a busy high- 
way. 

She walked a mile and saw 
no more vehicles, met no one. 
Another dog investigated her 
much as the first one had 
done. She saw several cats, 
but they ignored her com- 
pletely. 

W HEN she saw the lights 
of a town, she proceeded 
with more caution. The street 
lights were a nuisance. Al- 
though the town seemed dead, 
she didn’t dare walk along 
the streets. 

She crept behind the first 
house. Three people inside, all 
asleep. But the fourth house 
was empty. 

Twenty minutes spent ex- 



amining the doors and win- 
dows showed her the difficulty, 
of her task. She had to steal 
clothes and money. Later she 
would return them somehow 
or other; the Vigintan moral 
code was strict in such mat- 
ters. But with limited knowl- 
edge of the people from whom 
she was trying to steal, it 
seemed to be impossible to 
take anything without leaving 
too many clues. 

A fingerprint on a window 
would be a clue. How much 
more significant it would be, 
she thought, to leave a finger- 
print which wasn’t quite a 
fingerprint . 

In the end she had to take 
the chance of entering an oc- 
cupied house. Empty houses 
were too well locked up. The 
house she chose had an open 
downstairs window. 

There were two people in 
the house, both upstairs. 
Keeping her mental eye on 
them all the time, Vee went 
from room to room searching 
for clothes. She found only 
shoes which didn’t fit her. 
Naturally enough, clothes 
would be kept in bedrooms. 

After half an hour of fum- 
bling in the dark, not daring to 
put on a light, Vee was get- 
ting desperate. Soon she’d 
have to start back to the life- 
boat, and she had accomplish- 
ed nothing yet. 

She tried another house, 
knowing five people were 
asleep in it, two of them 
downstairs. It was a large 



14 



J. T. MclNTOSH 




house. Her reasoning was that 
in such a house there was 
more chance of things being 
left around in more places. 

In a room facing the back, 
she switched on the light. 
Caution had got her nowhere. 
She soon found that reckless- 
ness had brought a rich re- 
ward. 

She was in a spare bed- 
room and all the drawers 
were filled with clothes, 
women’s clothes. 

Wasting no time, she dress- 
ed herself clumsily. Fortu- 
nately television plays not in- 
frequently showed women 
dressing and undressing. She 
selected rather the clothes 
which might not be missed 
for a while than those which 
fitted best, although she gues- 
sed the chances of their being 
missed were remote. 

There were no shoes. Dres- 
sed in a sweater and skirt, 
she searched in other rooms 
and finally found a pair of 
sandals which fitted fairly 
well. 

Unlike anybody else in 
this world, she could make 
her feet fit the shoes, given 
time. 

Leaving the house, she de- 
cided to call it a night. She 
was dressed after a fashion. 
She had no idea how she 
would look to a human, and 
had no intention of finding out 
immediately. Future forays 
would be necessary. 

She started to walk back 
to her lifeboat. 



I T TOOK Vee two weeks 
more before she was ready 
to risk meeting people. By the 
end of that time she felt very 
low, not having had any com- 
panionship for so long. Only 
the radio and television pro- 
grams and hope had kept her 
going. 

She had borrowed some 
medical books for a few 
hours. She had watched people 
from hiding. She had seen 
dead bodies at the local 
morgue. 

And she had made herself 
completely human, apart from 
certain things which . she 
didn’t abandon because she 
couldn’t— like the ability to 
change back to her own shape 
and to exist, if necessary, on 
vegetable matter which ordi- 
nary humans would not regard 
as food. 

Naturally she had tried to 
make herself as attractive as 
possible. How far she had 
been successful, she had no 
means of knowing. 

Money had remained a 
problem for a long time. If 
it was difficult to steal clothes, 
it was ten times as difficult to 
steal money. These humans — 
of whom she thought, now, as 
“people” — never seemed to 
leave money lying around. 
And if you did get your 
hands on money which wasn’t 
yours, you were pretty sure 
to be caught. 

For a while she considered 
letting herself be caught. 
She’d be put in jail and looked 



IN A BODY 



15 




after, become somebody else’s 
responsibility. But she dis- 
carded the idea because that 
way she’d forfeit too many 
rights. Private citizens had a 
lot of rights in this country, 
though the radio sometimes 
suggested that this wasn’t so 
everywhere. Unless you for- 
feited them by becoming a 
criminal, you could do pretty 
much what you liked here and 
nobody interfered with you. 

Her long hours of watching 
and waiting around the vil- 
lage, which she now knew was 
called Slacksville, finally paid 
off. 

A storekeeper ran out 
when there was an accident 
in the street, and Vee was able 
to rob the till. She felt miser- 
able about it, but she knew 
she had no choice. Without 
money, you could get by if 
you knew enough to get and 
keep a job. With money, you 
might be able to learn enough 
to get a job. 

She had a little over a hun- 
dred dollars, not much, but all 
she intended to steal. 

Only fifty miles away, she 
knew now, was a city — not 
a big, important city, but 
many times larger than the 
tiny town which had unwill- 
ingly furnished her immediate 
needs. 

She hid the lifeboat so com- 
pletely that it might not be 
found in a hundred years. 
There was nothing to pack. 
In her stolen sweater and 
skirt, she walked ten miles in 

16 



the opposite direction from 
Slacksville, strolled casually 
into another small town, and 
waited to see what would hap- 
pen. 

Nothing happened. A mid- 
dle-aged woman looked at her 
incuriously, a child gazed up 
at her, a youth of seventeen 
gave her the once-over. No- 
body stared ; nobody looked 
away quickly. 

She had been successful, 
then, but not completely suc- 
cessful. She knew how boys 
of seventeen were supposed 
to react to the kind of girl she 
had tried to make herself, and 
this one conspicuously failed 
to do so. However, that was 
of less importance than the 
thing which had already been 
quite clearly established — she 
could pass among humans as 
one of them. 

A T THE depot she bought 
a ticket to the city. It was 
the first time she had attempt- 
ed human speech. The only re- 
action she could observe was 
indifference. 

It was the same on the 
train. Although glad that she 
had been so successful in her 
primary purpose, Vee was 
conscious of pique too. In her 
own world she had never been 
so disregarded. Her feminine 
reaction was that it would 
be better to be downright ugly 
than anonymous. 

A girl in white was coming 
along through the car. There 
was a stir. Vee began to un- 

j. t. McIntosh 




derstand why nobody looked 
twice at her. 

The girl was cleaner than 
a new nickel and shone as 
brightly. Every dark hair was 
in place. Her pink blush was 
not natural, nor were her lush 
dark-red lips, but there was 
nothing natural about this 
white, shiny, immaculate 
creature. Her high breasts 
were molded by nylon and 
elastic, her flat stomach was 
under rigid, unseen control, 
her skin was a labor of chemi- 
cal love. 

Television hadn’t shown 
such detail. Vee still had a lot 
to learn. She was merely a 
girl in an old sweater and 
skirt that was new but only 
fitted more or less. 

When she reached the city, 
she shut her eyes to its com- 
plexity, its wonder. Later she 
would look at it. First she 
needed a place to stay. 

She found one easily 
enough, going through the 
routine she had seen on tele- 
vision : girl-arrives-in-city- 

finds-apartment. 

She told the myopic land- 
lady, Mrs. Decker, that she 
had left her luggage at the 
station until she found a room. 
Mrs. Decker was satisfied. 

As Vee came out of her 
room, intending to go out 
again and take a look at the 
immediate neighborhood of 
179 Buckwash Street, a tall, 
good-looking young man came 
out of the next room. He had 
black hair and rather pale 

IN A BODY 



skin, as if he spent a lot of 
time indoors. 

Vee smiled at him, and he 
smiled back. He nearly said 
something, but then he cleared 
his throat unnecessarily, look- 
ed away and popped back into 
his room like a startled rab- 
bit. 

Vee didn’t recognize shy- 
ness. She thought he just 
wasn’t interested in a girl as 
mediocre in appearance as she 
was. 

Since she hadn’t managed 
to make herself into the kind 
of glamour girl who, in tele- 
vision at any rate, was al- 
ways surrounded by attentive, 
admiring males, it was obvi- 
ously useless just to wait for 
a soulmate to come along.. 
She’d have to go find one. 

W ALT saw Janet’s car half 
a block away. “Damn," 
he said upder his breath. She 
knew all the places he was 
likely to go — half a dozen 
times now, she had trapped 
him and they had played out 
half-bitter, half-tender scenes 
in no essential respect differ- 
ent from the first. 

This time she hadn’t seen 
him. He cut through the park. 
Let her wait — if she missed 
him often enough, maybe 
she’d give up and go away. 

He was tired of fighting 
Janet and knew that his re- 
sistance wouldn’t last much 
longer — although he still pas- 
sionately believed he was 
right. Why couldn’t she see 

17 




what was so clear to him, that 
if he thought only of himself, 
he wouldn’t do this? It was 
for Janet’s sake that he was 
trying to break with her. 

Finding himself at the en- 
trance to Bill McEwan’s office, 
Walt went in. He was sup- 
posed to keep in touch. 

McEwan was professionally 
hearty, and Walt decided not 
to call on him again. As Mc- 
Ewan had already admitted, 
he could do nothing. All he 
had left was his bedside man- 
ner. 

As Walt was leaving, Mc- 
Ewan said : “Girl came in this 
morning asking if I could put 
her in touch with people like 
you. Said she belonged to some 
organization I’d never heard 
of, but it sounds good. 

“You didn’t give her my 
name, did you?” 

“No, but I thought it might 
interest you.” 

Walt frowned at him. “Why 
should you think that?” 

“You might like to meet 
this girl,” McEwan said. 

Shrugging, Walt took a note 
of her address : 179 Buckwash 
Street. 

Outside, he barely missed 
running into Janet again. She 
had moved her car. 

Exasperated, he hoped that 
the Friends of People with a 
Year to Live, or whatever 
they called themselves, might 
be able to help him to get rid 
of Janet. He headed toward 
179 Buckwash Street. 

“Miss Vee Brown?" said 

18 



the myopic landlady. “Yeah, 
she’s in. Working in the base- 
ment. You a chemist too?” 

“In the basement?” Walt 
said. 

“Yeah, she rents it.” 

Walt went down the stone 
steps. He found a blonde in 
a white smock working at a 
lab bench. 

She was quite pretty. Cold, 
somehow, he thought. 

As she came toward him, 
wiping her hands, he said: 
“I’m Walt Rinker. Dr. Mc- 
Ewan said you’d been to see 
him this morning . .” 

He left it like that, so that 
she’d have to do the talking. 

She nodded coolly. “You’re 
a patient of his, Mr. Rinker?” 
“Yes." 

“You have an incurable 
disease?” 

“Yp<? ” 

“Cancer?” 

“Leukemia.” 

“Mr. Rinker, this isn’t a 
comfortable place to talk and 
I can’t take you up to my 
apartment. Would you have 
coffee with me in the diner 
next door?” 

“Look,” he said. “This is 
kind of silly. I came along 
just out of curiosity. Frank- 
ly, I came because I wondered 
about you.” 

“About me?” 

“It was a fool thing to do. 
I don’t need any help, I’ve got 
plenty of money, my mind 
isn’t going to collapse under 
the strain. Sorry to have both- 
ered you. Miss Brown.” 

j. t. McIntosh 




“You mean you want to go 
now?” 

For the first time he sensed 
emotion in her. And it was 
emotion of startling intensity. 
He began to think she was a 
nut, the kind of eccentric who 
felt she had a mission. 

As he was about to turn 
and go up the steps again, 
being as rude as might be 
necessary to get away from 
her, she took off her lab 
smock and said quietly : “Well, 
it won’t hurt to talk here for 
half an hour.” 

“No, I guess not,” he said. 

They sat down. 

V EE hadn’t found it hard 
to make money after all. 
From television and radio she 
had learned that although 
fortunes could be made at 
race tracks with very little 
outlay, betting on horses was 
generally considered a gamble. 

Still, she had visited a race 
track to confirm this view of 
the matter. And she had 
found that, for her, betting 
on horses wasn’t foolish at all. 

You could see the runners, 
that was the point. And Vee, 
with the trained eye of a 
species which could change its 
own physical structure at will, 
could establish an awful lot 
from seeing the runners. She 
could not merely tell the best, 
strongest fastest horses; far 
more important, she could 
form a pretty good impres- 
sion of the probable winners. 
There were failures, of 

IN A BODY 



course. At first she didn’t 
properly understand the math- 
ematics of this particular 
form of betting. Even when 
she did, the horse which 
should have won didn’t al- 
ways win. And when the 
probable winner was short- 
priced, a bet in the small sums 
she could spare was neither 
economically sound nor partic- 
ularly productive. 

But she wasn’t compelled 
to bet on short-priced horses. 
And the advantage of her 
special sense was that when 
a long shot was going to come 
up, Vee was the only one at 
the course who knew it before- 
hand. 

She soon had enough money 
for her immediate needs. The 
first thing she did was buy 
some clothes. 

She had discovered, mean- 
time, one of the peculiarities 
of this society. If you were 
willing to be labeled a crank, 
you could get away with 
practically anything. 

Walt Rinker wasn’t the first 
person who had come to see 
her. There had been three 
hypochondriacs and two can- 
cer cases too far gone for her 
to do anything for them. 

She didn’t know yet 
whether she could do anything 
for Walter, but he was the 
first to interest her person- 
ally. 

She decided, at the end of 
the half-hour, that he was to 
be her soulmate. 

As they emerged from the 

19 




basement, she stopped at the 
foot of the stairs. 

“I have to go upstairs for 
a moment,” she said. “You’ll 
wait?” 

“Sure.” 

She hesitated for a moment 
longer. Now that he had seen 
her, he might make his escape 
thankfully. However, she 
couldn’t handcuff him to her 
— yet. 

Running lightly up to her 
apartment, she once again 
passed Billy Clark, the tall, 
good-looking boy in the next 
room. 

“Miss Brown,” he said, put- 
ting out his hand as if to 
stop her. 

“Yes?” she said. She tried 
not to betray her impatience, 
but her hand came up to open 
her door. The sooner she got 
back to Walt, the less chance 
there would be of finding him 
gone. 

“Nothing,” he muttered. 
“Some other time.” 

Vee went in, unlocked the 
middle drawer of the dressing 
table and took out a small 
package. She would have liked 
to change into something 
more glamorous than the in- 
determinate blue dress she 
was wearing, but didn’t want 
to take the risk that Walt 
would walk out on her. Put- 
ting the package in her hand- 
bag, she turned and went out 
again. 

To her surprise, Billy Clark 
was still waiting outside. She 
smiled at him automatically. 

20 



He opened his mouth to speak, 
but before anything came out, 
she was halfway down the 
stairs. 

It was a relief to find that 
Walt had not gone away. 

D RINKING coffee in an al- 
cove, Walt was still sorry 
he had come. Vee Brown was, 
of course, a nut. The trouble 
was that she wasn’t even an 
interesting nut. She talked 
characterlessly, like the people 
in bad scripts who said merely 
what the plot required them 
to say. 

She asked him quite a few' 
questions which he answered 
truthfully but briefly. 

“How about me asking 
something for a change?” he 
said. “Just what is all this 
about?” 

She looked at him steadily. 
“Mr. Rinker, are you pre- 
pared to try out an experi- 
mental cure for leukemia?” 
Walt was suddenly angry. 
“Think I’m crazy? There’s no 
cure.” 

“Then you lose nothing.” 
“And gain nothing.” 

She shook her head. “That’s 
not true. If my method doesn’t 
cure you, at least it will give 
you longer to live.” 

He was still angry. “Who | 
do you think you’re fooling? j 
If there was a cure, every • 
newspaper in the world would j 
be carrying the story.” 

“Not if they didn’t know 
about it. And nobody does.” 

“A thing like this would be 

j. t. mcintosh 




known about long before it 
happened. People don’t dis- 
cover things by accident any 
more.” 

“Don’t they? Offhand, I 
seem to remember reading 
that isoniazid, the TB drug, 
was a byproduct of rocket re- 
search. Besides, did I say this 
cure was discovered by acci- 
dent?” 

“There isn’t a cure!” he 
almost shouted, trembling. 

Not until this girl claimed 
to be able to cure him had he 
realized how much he wanted 
to live. 

You were told you had 
leukemia and were going to 
die. It was like the moment 
after an injury when some- 
how you didn’t lose conscious- 
ness. There was no pain yet, 
only numbness. 

And mercifully the numb- 
ness went on. There was no 
argument with cancer or 
leukemia. You might live 
longer than they said, or not 
as long, but you were under 
sentence. 

With tuberculosis, meningi- 
tis, tumors, almost anything 
else, there was a chance. With 
leukemia, death wasn’t a mat- 
ter of if; it was a matter of 
when. 

And that maintained the 
numbness, the numbness out 
of which Walt had been able 
to withstand the pleas of 
Janet, knowing he was right. 

Now, irresponsibly, this 
woman made him face the 
thought of being cured, the 

IN A BODY 



thought of being able to go to 
Janet and say . 

As he stared down at Vee, 
it suddenly seemed to him 
that he had never known any- 
body who looked less crazy. 
Cold she was, apart from that 
moment in the basement when 
for a moment her feelings had 
broken through, but it was the 
coldness of a girl who was 
under strict, almost unnatural 
self-control. 

If a girl of twenty-five or so 
did happen to have a cure for 
leukemia, she might be like 
this girl, act like this girl. 

He sat down, still not be- 
lieving in Vee, still hating her. 

Vee felt his hatred and fail- 
ed to understand it. She was 
bewildered and frightened. 
This was the man she had 
chosen as her soulmate, unless 
he had any really serious de- 
fect of temperament. It was 
a simple bargain — she would 
give him life and he would 
be hers. Other women in his 
life, whether he was married 
or not, didn’t matter. The 
other women couldn’t save 
him; Vee could. 

Surely any reasonable crea- 
ture, human or otherwise, 
would accept life with her as 
an alternative to death. If for 
no other reason, gratitude 
would compel Walt to do as 
she wished. 

“Why do you hate me?” she 
asked steadily. 

“You’ve made me hope,” he 
said. “I know you’re a sensa- 
tion-seeking nut. But you’ve 

21 




made me think what it would 
be like not to die.” 

Vee felt better. She could 
understand that. “I know.” 
“Tell me about this cure of 
yours. How does it work? 
Convince me.” 

“You don’t have to be con- 
vinced. It works whether you 
understand it or not, like 
serum or antibiotics.” 

Damn it, was there ever 
such inhuman self-control ? 
She didn’t even seem to feel 
the need to justify herself. 

“Tell me about it all the 
same,” he said furiously. 

Vee considered. Could she 
tell him about the restorer? 

O N VEE’s world, evolution 
had demanded the ability 
to change one’s physical 
shape. Back in the savage 
days, long before the first stir- 
rings of civilization, the way 
to survive had been periodic 
metamorphosis. The briffs, 
the keymors, all the different 
types of mally, each in turn 
had ruled the world — physi- 
cally. Mentally, Vee’s race had 
always been supreme. But 
Vee’s race (which never had a 
name of its own, for its mem- 
bers called themselves and 
were the creatures they hap- 
pened to be duplicating at the 
time) was not warlike. Unable 
to survive by fighting, they 
had survived by being their 
enemies. 

Later, much later, the other 
races of the Vigintan worlds 
so objected to this habit that 

22 



Vee’s race signed an agree- 
ment never to imitate any of 
the Vigintan species. Al- 
though this promise was 
scrupulously kept, Vee and her 
people could no more lose the 
faculty of metamorphosis 
than a man with ears among 
deaf people could forget how 
to hear. 

A human male with this 
faculty might retain his hu- 
man shape, but he would make 
himself tall, strong and hand- 
some. A human female would 
make herself independent of 
aids to beauty, as Vee had 
done, merely by making mus- 
cles of the necessary tone and 
strength. 

Members of Vee’s race died, 
usually, of disease peculiar to 
the kind of creature they hap- 
pened to be emulating. They 
were particularly susceptible, 
for they made themselves, in 
effect, into pure, perfect, ex- 
act, immaculate specimens — 
without, of course, even the 
slightest experience of any of 
the relevant diseases. Once ill, 
changing again didn’t help. In 
effect, they took the disease 
with them. 

When technology began, 
however, the restorer was de- 
veloped. And hardly anyone 
ever died any more except in 
accidents or of extreme old 
age. 

The restorer was a tiny ob- 
ject manufactured from bod- 
ily secretions. In a sense, it 
was alive. It was certainly 
organic. Yet it was only a 

j. t. McIntosh 




pattern — a pattern of the kind 
of life-form the creature who 
secreted it was imitating. It 
was the essence of the species, 
so basic that it would be the 
same for Asiatic, Negro or 
Occidental, man or woman, 
child or oldster. 

On becoming ill, you swal- 
lowed the restorer — part nat- 
ural, part artificial. It spread 
in the blood to brain, heart, 
lungs. And the whole physical 
effort of the body was directed 
to the restoration of the nat- 
ural pattern — normal good 
health. 

When the other Vigintan 
races discovered that the re- 
storer worked for them too, 
Vee’s people suddenly became 
exceedingly popular, and their 
peculiar gift, hitherto regard- 
ed with suspicion at least, 
made them everybody’s 
friend. 

That was all very well in 
the Vigintan worlds, but Vee 
could hardly explain any of 
this to Walt. 

“No,” she said. She took 
a small pill from her handbag. 
“Swallow that without chew- 
ing it and your cure be- 
gins.” 

He took it and looked at it 
— an ordinary white pill. Once 
again he felt anger and frus- 
tration rise in him. A little 
white pill like that couldn’t 
do any good. 

He looked up at Vee. “What 
do you get out of this whole 
business?” 

“Nothing at the moment.” 

IN A BODY 



“At the moment? And 
later?” 

“I am not after money,” she 
said firmly. 

Confused, suspicious, Walt 
put the pill in his mouth and 
swallowed it. 

Barring accidents, he was 
cured now. Although the proc- 
ess of cure had barely start- 
ed, it was complete. He needed 
nothing more. But Vee didn’t 
propose to tell him that yet. 

“You’re a chemist?” Walt 
said uncertainly. 

She nodded. 

He wanted to believe in her, 
was afraid to believe in her. 
“Did you work for any of the 
big firms?” 

She smiled. “Go home. 
Come back here the night 
after next.” 

“Go home?” 

She stood up. “In about an 
hour you’ll feel lightheaded,” 
she said. “It won’t be unpleas- 
ant and you’ll be all right if 
you lie down. The less you do 
tomorrow, the better. If you 
get up, stay in a chair all day. 
You’ll probably be hungry. 
Eat anything you like. Come 
back the following night.” 

Maintaining her incredible 
composure to the end, she 
walked out. Walt went to the 
desk to pay the bill, but she 
had even done that. 

V EE SPENT the next day 
at the race track win- 
ning carefully, not spectacu- 
larly. Some day she would 
have to arrange an entirely 

23 




honest income. She didn’t con- 
sider betting on horses honest 
for her, any more than it 
would be honest for her to bet 
on the number of peas in a 
bottle when she knew the 
answer. 

She had already sent money 
anonymously to various ad- 
dresses in Slacksville. Eventu- 
ally she intended to return 
her winnings by the simple 
means of making losing bets 
to the right bookmakers. 

Vigintan morality was dif- 
ferent from human morality. 
There was no arguing with it. 

On the morning of the day 
Walt was to call, she rented 
a large but discreet apart- 
ment in a different part of the 
city, and spent the rest of the 
day putting it in order. 

In the evening she returned 
to 179 Buckwash Street, and 
when Walt called, she took 
him out immediately and di- 
rected a taxi driver to take 
them to the new apartment. 

“Where are we going?” 
Walt demanded. 

“Wait and see.” 

“Miss Brown, I — ” 

“You might as well call me 
Vee.” 

She was as cool as ever, but 
twice as pretty as he remem- 
bered. In fact, she was an 
astonishingly beautiful girl — 
astonishing because, although 
she was undoubtedly the same 
girl, she hadn’t left him with 
that impression before. If 
only she acted like — well, not 
necessarily like Janet, but like 

24 



any other girl, with likes and 
dislikes, a sense of humor, 
perhaps, not just that same 
cool, impersonal manner all 
the time — she could be a re- 
markably attractive woman. 
Not that that was anything 
to him, of course. 

“Vee,” he said, “I don’t 
know what’s been happening 
to me, but something has. I 
feel — I feel as if there’s a fire 
in my body, but a soothing 
fire. Vee, tell me the truth. 
Am I really getting better?” 

“You should be,” she said. 

“And that’s all there is to 
it — taking a pill?” 

That was all there was to 
it, but Vee had far too slight 
a hold on him so far to tell 
him that. The interval of 
forty-eight hours had been 
carefully calculated. She want- 
ed him to believe that he was 
being cured, not that he was 
already cured. 

“Pills,” she amended. 

“For how long?” 

“It depends. When you’re 
cured, you can stop taking 
pills.” 

“But . Vee . How come, 
if this works as you say, no- 
body knows about it? Why 
don’t you shout it from the 
rooftops?” 

“Walt, I want you to prom- 
ise me not to tell anybody 
what’s happening to you 
meantime. When I do release 
it, I want to know exactly 
what it is and what it will 
do.” 

“Sure, but every day people 

j. t. McIntosh 




are dying who might be — ” 

“Walt, I promise you that 
the treatment will be made 
available to everybody when 
I know how to handle it. In 
fact, you’ll help me, won’t 
you?’’ 

He didn’t get a chance to 
answer, for the cab had drawn 
up and Vee was getting out. 

The apartment stupefied 
him. As he looked at its pastel 
shades with the occasional 
splashes of saturated color, 
his eyes narrowed thought- 
fully and he turned presently 
to look at Vee with a certain 
speculation which had been 
absent from his gaze so far. 

With her near-telepathic 
sense, she realized at once that 
though she personally had not 
struck him as strange enough 
for any suspicion of the truth 
about her origin to cross his 
mind, she had overreached 
herself in the decoration of 
the apartment — although it 
had been done rapidly and 
sketchily with furniture ob- 
tainable from stock, and al- 
though much had been left 
as she had found it. From 
the moment when she had first 
seen an image form in the 
screen in her lifeboat, she had 
been concentrating on model- 
ing herself on the kind of hu- 
man female whom human 
males liked. She had devoted 
only a passing glance to the 
kind of decor they were ac- 
customed to. 

“Do you like it?” she said. 
“I'm going to have the walls 

IN A BODY 



green, but the ceiling and 
lighting could stay, don’t you 
think?” 

His vague, formless suspi- 
cion dissolved and was wash- 
ed away. But he asked : “Why 
do you have two apartments?” 

She shrugged. “This is 
where I’m going to live. The 
other is rented till the end of 
the week. Would you like a 
drink?” 

He hesitated. Although he 
had dismissed from his mind 
the curious first impression 
that the room had had on him, 
the strangeness of this woman 
and her behavior and the 
effect of the pill she had given 
him made him uneasy. 

“Why did you bring me 
here?” he asked. 

Vee was uneasy too. He 
just didn’t react the way he 
was supposed to. She had 
changed her dress and ap- 
pearance slightly, subtly, and 
had sensed at first that she 
was making a better impres- 
sion on him than on their first 
meeting. 

“I want to make some 
tests,” she said. 

“Then hadn’t you better do 
that before you offer me a 
drink?” 

“I guess so, yes.” 

The undercurrent felt 
wrong. She would have to try 
something, anything. “What 
do you think of me?” she 
asked abruptly. 

“You’re a strange girl.” 

The words told her some- 
thing, but not as much as 

25 




what accompanied them did. 
You’re cold. You smile, but 
you don’t laugh. I just don’t 
know what makes you tick. 

“Wait here a minute/' she 
said, and went through to her 
bedroom, closing the door be- 
hind her. 

S HE COULD abandon Walt 
and find someone else. 
Love, for members of Vee’s 
race, was less capricious than 
among humans. They found 
possible soulmates — which 

was easy, with their near-tele- 
pathy — and gradually, pro- 
gressively, loved them. There 
were no second thoughts. 

Already Vee felt too much 
for Walt to be willing to tear 
herself from him and start 
anew. But she could do it. She 
could do it now. With every 
hour she spent with him, it 
got tougher. Soon it would be 
impossible. 

She made up her mind, 
shrugging away her doubts. 
If she failed with Walt, why 
should she succeed with any 
other human male? 

Her present tactics were 
wrong, that was all. She re- 
membered a television play 
about a girl scientist. Men 
thought her a washout when 
she wore glasses and a lab 
smock. But she was a wow 
when her hair came loose, and 
she got a little drunk, and the 
plot somehow got her into a 
bathing suit. 

Vee would start again — re- 
membering that her excuse 

26 



for keeping Walt here was the 
necessity of making tests of 
one sort or another. 

Walt looked up as she em- 
erged with a syringe. 

“I want samples of your 
blood,” she said. “I’m going to 
take a count in one hour, two 
hours, and three hours.” 
“Mean you want me to stay 
for three hours?” 

“I’d have you stay all night, 
only I don’t want you claim- 
ing I raped you.” 

She giggled at his expres- 
sion. But she drew off the 
blood sample competently, ex- 
cept that a drop fell on her 
skirt 

“Siob,” she said. “Why 
don’t you watch where you’re 
bleeding?” 

“What are you going to do 
with that blood?” Walt asked. 
“Get it off if I can.” 

“I don’t mean on your skirt. 
What are you going to do with 
the sample?” 

“Drink it, of course.” 

She went back in the other 
room. A moment later she put 
her head out the door. “Walt, 
make yourself useful. The 
bathroom’s through there. See 
if you can get this clean.” 
She threw something at him 
which proved to be her skirt. 

When she came back in five 
minutes, she was wearing a 
short wrap which showed she 
had exceedingly beautiful 
legs. “Don’t stare at me as if 
I weren’t wearing anything 
underneath,” she said. “I am. 
Look.” 



j. t. McIntosh 




She flicked her wrap and 
Walt saw she was wearing 
white panties. At the same 
time he saw she wasn’t wear- 
ing anything else. 

“Look, Vee,” he said. “We 
might as well get one thing 
clear now, in case there’s any 
misunderstanding. I’ve got a 
girl, Janet. We’d be married 
except that I wouldn’t get 
married with this hanging 
over me. If I do get better, 
it’s Janet for me. Is that 
clear?” 

“Sure,” said Vee. “I under- 
stand English real good.” 

Walt persisted. “I mean 
Janet’s the only girl for me. 
When I thought I was going 
to die, I tried to brush her 
off. But if I don’t die — well, 
there’s going to be nobody else 
but Janet.” 

About that, Vee thought, 
there may be two opinions. 

“Have a drink,” Vee said. 

She got inside the skin of 
the character she had adopted. 
She was frank, outspoken, 
warmly sexy, inviting. And 
Walt had a good time with 
her. She laughed easily and he 
wondered dazedly why he’d 
ever thought she was cold and 
stiff. 

After an hour, she left him 
for a few minutes. Returning, 
she gave him another small 
white pill. 

“Walt,” she said solemnly, 
“I think you’re going to be all 
right. I’ll check again later, 
but I can tell you now — keep 
up the treatment and your 

IN A BODY 



worries are over. Let’s have 
a drink to celebrate.” 

They had a drink to cele- 
brate. They had several 
drinks. 

And eventually, despite his 
excellent resolutions, the alco- 
hol and the proximity of Vee 
and the sure knowledge that 
she was ready and willing 
broke down his resistance. 

At first he merely had an 
irresistible impulse to fold 
back the collar of her wrap. 
Finding himself practically 
kissing her, he did kiss her. 

Vee was sure enough of 
herself and him to whisp- 
er mockingly : “Remember 

Janet, Walt.” 

“The hell with Janet,” he 
said hoarsely. 

B UT THE next day things 
looked different to him. 
Wakening about eleven o’- 
clock, Walt lost no time in 
getting dressed, hardly look- 
ing at Vee. 

Despite the hard drinking 
they’d been doing, he felt bet- 
ter than he had for months. 
There remained no doubt in 
his mind that he was going to 
be well again. 

And it suddenly became a 
matter of desperate urgency 
to see Janet. 

“Tonight again, Walt,” Vee 
said before he left. 

“How long do I have to 
keep taking pills?” 

“Every night.” 

“Can’t you give me them 

now?” 



27 




“No. I’ve got to keep check- 
ing results.” 

He shrugged. Her methods 
might be peculiar, but appar- 
ently they worked. He felt the 
need to say something more, 
feeling the awkwardness that 
a man always feels when 
something has happened 
which the girl takes much 
more seriously than he does. 

“Vee, I—” 

“Don’t talk now,” she said. 
‘The morning’s no time for 
talking. Tell me one thing, 
though — do you like my 
dress?” 

He couldn’t help grinning. 
She wasn’t wearing a dress. 

H E hurried out, took a cab 
and waited impatient- 
ly at the Kentucky House, 
where Janet generally lunch- 
ed. For weeks Janet had been 
chasing him relentlessly, beg- 
ging, pleading, crying, argu- 
ing, demanding, insisting. The 
last time they had had a scene 
had been just before he met 
Vee. With his mind he knew 
there was no chance that 
Janet had suddenly changed, 
yet in his heart he was ter- 
ribly afraid that just at the 
moment when he had decided 
with infinite gladness that he 
could marry her after all, she 
had decided to take him at 
his word and never see him 
again. 

As the minutes passed and 
she didn’t come, he cursed 
himself for being so definite. 
Yet how could he have known 



that a miracle was going to 
happen? Short of a miracle, 
he had meant all he said to 
Janet. But if only he hadn’t 
been quite so hard, quite so 
certain . 

The food in front of him 
didn’t interest him at first. 
He’d been pecking at his 
meals for months, and despite 
what Vee had said, he hadn’t 
been particularly hungry the 
day before. However, when 
he started pecking as usual, 
he ate everything in sight, 
ordered more, and finally stop- 
ped eating only because he 
didn’t believe it could be right 
to go on eating until he burst. 

Besides, there was Janet. 
She didn’t come in to lunch. 
After his enormous meal, he 
went to her home. Her 
mother, surprised and doubt- 
ful at sight of him, said no, 
she wasn’t home, no, she 
wasn’t out of town, yes, she’d 
be home around eight. 

“Tell her to phone me when 
she comes in,” said Walt. He 
gave Vee’s number, for he’d 
be at her apartment at eight. 

It would be just as well, he 
decided, to make things quite 
clear. He’d tell Vee he expected 
Janet to call, and she could 
listen to him talking to Janet. 

Maybe that was cruel to 
Vee, to whom he owed his 
life. Maybe he shouldn’t have 
arranged things that way. But 
he had already told Vee about 
Janet, and the sooner she 
knew he meant what he said, 
the better.

W HEN he arrived at her 
apartment that night, she 
was already in a wrap, a long 
white negligee this time, and 
he was glad he had left a 
message for Janet to phone 
him here. 

“Look, Vee,” he said ab- 
ruptly, “you were very sweet 
last night. But I told you I 
was going to marry Janet, 
and I meant it. You under- 
stood that, didn’t you?” 

“If we’re going to have a 
stand-up fight,” said Vee 
pleasantly, “let’s at least sit 
down first.” 

He sat as far away from 
her as he could. 

“I shouldn’t have stayed 
here last night,” he said. “Be- 
cause I knew at the time that 
to you it was more than . 
I mean we’d only just met, 
and yet somehow I knew that 
you — ” 

“That I meant to marry 
you,” said Vee. 

Her calm certainty startled 
him. “Well — yes. But I told 
you about Janet, Vee. I meant 
it.” 

“So that made it all right 
to sleep with me.” 

“Vee, Janet’s going to phone 
me here. I’m going to tell her 
that I’m asking her to marry 
me again.” 

“How often have you been 
married to her?” 

“You know what I mean, 
damn it.” 

Vee crossed her legs and lay 
back. “If there’s going to be 
straight talking,” she said, 

IN A BODY 



“you can have the last word. I 
want the first.” 

“If there’s going to be 
straight talking,” Walt said, 
“pull that wrap over your legs 
and shut it at the top. I’m not 
made of wood.” 

“No,” said Vee mildly, “I 
know that, Walt.” 

She left her wrap the way it 
was. 

“Correct me if I’m wrong,” 
she said. “When you were go- 
ing to die, you weren’t going 
to marry Janet. Now that 
you’re going to live, you want 
her back.” 

“That’s right.” 

“I’m sorry, Walt. Under 
those conditions, you don’t get 
better.” 

He caught his breath. 
“What do you mean?” 
“Exactly what I say. It’s a 
simple bargain, Walt. Marry 
me and I’ll cure you. Marry 
Janet and you die.” 

He was staring at her in 
horror. “You’re crazy!” 

“Not at all. I didn’t mean to 
put it so bluntly so soon, Walt. 
I wanted to help you forget 
Janet and perhaps never have 
to deliver an ultimatum. But 
you’ve forced me to.” 

He shook his head incredu- 
lously. She was as calm, as 
businesslike as she had been 
earlier in their acquaintance. 
But for Janet, he might have 
loved the other Vee, the warm- 
er, exciting Vee. This one he 
didn’t like, Janet or no Janet. 

In the silence, the phone 
rang. 



29 




H E GOT up to answer it. 

Vee got up too. As if 
aware of what he had just 
been thinking, she was laugh- 
ing, playful. She barred his 
way. 

“I’m going to speak to Jan- 
et,” he said. 

“You said yourself you 
wouldn’t marry her unless you 
recovered. And if you marry 
her, you don’t recover. So why 
speak to her?” 

He tried to get past her. She 
dodged in front of him again. 
Grasping her firmly, he tried 
to push her to one side. But 
he was still not a well man and 
she was as strong as he was. 
He pulled at her shoulder and 
her wrap tore and hung to the 
swell of her hip at one side. 
She only laughed. 

The bell was still ringing. 
Furious, he aimed a vicious 
blow at Vee. She caught his 
arm and they both fell to the 
floor. 

“If your Janet could see you 
now,” she giggled breathless- 
ly, “there would certainly be 
no wedding.” 

Having gained the superior 
position, he tried to get up. 
Vee held his leg and though he 
kicked savagely, he couldn’t 
get free. 

The bell stopped ringing. At 
once Vee let go. Walt dived to 
the phone and picked it up. 
“Janet? Janet? This is Walt. 
Janet?” 

Silence. 

He slammed the phone 
down. Vee was getting to her 

30 



feet. “I could kill you!” he 
said. 

“I doubt it.” 

He picked up the phone 
again and started to dial. Vee 
moved behind him, and as he 
finished dialing, she mischiev- 
ously presented him with the 
cut end of the phone cable. 

Without thinking, he chop- 
ped at her with his fist. She 
went down in a heap at his 
feet. 

At once he was sorry, and 
picked her up. He carried her 
to the couch and was laying 
her gently on it when she 
opened her eyes and said con- 
versationally : “This is nice.” 

He dropped her angrily. 

She sat up. “Walt, when you 
think about it, it isn’t such a 
bad bargain. Would you hon- 
estly really rather die than 
marry me?” 

“I don’t get it,” he said bit- 
terly. “You’re young and 
you’re anything but ugly. Why 
does it have to be me?” 

“Because . .” But she was- 
n’t going to tell him it was 
because Billy Clark, when he 
had first seen her, had merely 
looked at her, smiled automati- 
cally and dived into his room. 
Because she had to have a 
soulmate, and soon. Because, 
for all her efforts, men didn’t 
go mad at sight of her, and 
even after what had happened 
between her and Walt, he 
wanted to cast her aside and 
marry his Janet. 

Because she had to be able 
to keep her man with her, and 

j. t. McIntosh 




if she couldn't do it without a 
leash and a collar, there had 
to be a leash and collar. 

Because if she didn’t have a 
soulmate she would die. 

If Walt only knew it, she 
had no hold over him. The pill 
she would give him soon look- 
ed like the restorer she had 
given him that first night, but 
it was nothing, did nothing. 
She had already done all she 
could for him. 

“Don’t you owe me some- 
thing, Walt?” she said. 

“I don’t owe you the rest of 
my life.” 

“Don’t you?” 

“Look, Vee, let’s look at this 
calmly. I can’t marry you and 
you wouldn’t want me to, 
knowing I love Janet.” 

“You won’t go on loving 
Janet.” 

“I will.” 

“You won’t.” 

S HE was certain of that. 

Given a chance, she could 
mold herself to Walt so com- 
pletely that he would talk of 
Janet shamefacedly as “a girl 
I used to know.” Given time, 
Vee and Walt could be as close 
as any human couple in the 
world. She was in no doubt 
about that. Only she had to be 
given the chance, given time. 

Walt tried again. “Vee, I 
thought at first you were 
pretty cold, but I don’t now. 
You’re a woman.” 

“Thanks, Walt. I always 
wondered about that.” 

“If you really believed, real- 

IN A BODY 



ly knew you couldn’t have me, 
you wouldn’t condemn me to 
death. I know that.” 

Vee knew it too. Sooner or 
later she’d have to give the 
restorer to everybody ; cer- 
tainly she couldn’t let Walt 
die, even if she lost him. It 
was unfortunate that he 
guessed that. 

“Oh, you’d be surprised how 
callous I can be,” she said 
lightly. 

They talked it back and 
forth, sometimes calmly, 
sometimes angrily. Vee didn’t 
shift her ground. 

When the door chimes 
sounded and Vee went to open 
the door, Walt didn’t move. It 
didn’t seem to be anything to 
him that somebody was calling 
on Vee. 

It was only when Janet 
came in, white and rigid, and 
he saw Vee’s mocking smile, 
that he realized that Vee had 
known all along who it would 
be. 

“So this is what you wanted 
to tell me,” said Janet. Neatly 
dressed in a blue wool suit, she 
looked almost boyish beside 
the flamboyant Vee, her wrap 
torn down one side to her 
rounded hips. 

“You must be Janet,” Vee 
said. “I’m sure you’d like a 
drink.” 

“Janet, I want to marry 
you,” Walt said. 

Janet didn’t look at Vee. 
“Once I said I wouldn’t leave 
you until you found some 
other girl. Now you have.” 



31 





“I haven’t . Listen, Janet, 
Vee is a chemist. She has a 
treatment — I’m not going to 
die.” 

Yes you are, if you marry 
her. That was on the tip of 
Vee’s tongue, but she stopped 
herself in time and didn’t say 
it. The effect would be to put 
Janet on Walt’s side against 
her. 

There were tears in Janet’s 
voice. “Walt, honey, I told you 

32 



all along if you wanted a girl I 
was waiting.” 

“Janet, I don’t love Vee. 
Please believe that.” 

“It’s true,” said Vee. “He 
beats me all the time.” 

“She’s damnably clever, 
Janet,” Walt said. “Every- 
thing she’ll say will be meant 
to turn you against me. She 
wants to marry me.” 

“I didn’t know I was at the 
end of a line of girls all want- 

j. t. McIntosh 




ing to marry you,” Janet whis- “What does that prove?” 
pered. “I thought you were all Janet asked doubtfully, 
mine, Walt. I thought you “It shows I was trying to 
needed me.” talk to you, and she was try- 

Vee laughed. ing to stop me.” 

Like an animal at bay, The atmosphere changed. 

Walt looked wildly around 

him. And suddenly he "l^EE was more desperate 

pounced. “Look!” he shouted. ▼ than Walt, although she 
“When you phoned earlier, didn’t show it. She was fight- 

she wouldn’t let me answer, ing, literally, for her life. 

And then she cut the cord. Having feelings, she was 
See?” sorry for Janet. But if Janet 



IN A BODY 



33 




lost Walt, she wouldn’t die. 
Janet was young and pretty, 
and within three months 
Janet would have another 
man crazy about her. 

In three months Vee could 
perhaps have a man crazy 
about her too, only Vee 
couldn’t wait tnree months. 
Without a soulmate, she was 
on the point of perishing 
now. She couldn’t afford to 
lose Walt. 

“Have a drink, Janet,” she 
said. 

“How long have you 
known her?” Janet demanded. 

“Three days,” said Walt. 

“Three nights,” Vee mur- 
mured. 

Walt spun on her. “For 
Pete’s sake, go put something 
on, Vee!” 

“All right,” she said mildly, 
knowing Walt didn’t expect 
that. 

A S she left them together, 
Vee was aware that if 
they had the sense to walk 
out together, she had lost. 
She banked on Janet being 
slow to forgive. 

When the door closed be- 
hind her, Walt said rapidly: 
“Janet, she can cure me. Be- 
lieve that. But now she’s 
blackmailing me. Either I 
marry her or there won’t be 
any cure.” 

“I don’t understand any 
part of this,” Janet said 
wearily, “except that you and 
she are lovers.” 

Walt should have had an 

34 



answer ready. Silence was 
worse than anything he might 
have said. 

“So its true,” she whis- 
pered. 

“Janet, I’m only flesh and 
blood, and she — ” 

“I’m only flesh and blood 
too. What was wrong with 
me?” 

“If you’ll only let me ex- 
plain — ” 

Vee came back, cool and 
elegant in a white dress. 
Janet looked at her and Vee’s 
fabulous figure made her jeal- 
ous and unsure. Part of her 
said, “It’s only natural that 
Walt should forget himself 
with a girl like that. Forgive 
him.” The rest of her said, 
“If only Vee had been ugly, 
I wouldn’t have minded so 
much.” 

Janet wasn’t conceited, 
wasn’t sure of herself. When 
her rival was a girl like Vee, 
what chance had she? 

“Have a drink, Janet,” Vee 
said. 

“Is that how it was?” 
Janet asked Walt bitterly. 
“You were drunk?” 

“She made me stay. There 
were tests. Some blood got on 
her skirt.” 

“So naturally she took it 
off. Any girl would. And you 
. you and she ...” 

Janet was well brought up. 
She could think things, but 
she couldn’t say them. 

“Janet, you’re a nice girl,” 
Vee said. “I don’t think you 
quite understand Walt.” 

j. t. McIntosh 




“That’s right. I don’t. Ob- 
viously I never did.” 

“Janet, will you listen?” 
Walt begged. “Vee said she 
could cure me. I had nothing 
to lose. I tried her way. And 
it works. Already I feel so 
much better that today I went 
to the Kentucky House to 
look for you, to ask you to 
marry me. But you didn’t 
come.” 

“So you came here instead. 
And left a message for me to 
phone you here.” 

“Don’t you care that now 
I may live?” 

“With her. You can live 
with Vee. She can keep you 
going. You need her. You 
never needed me.” 

“Janet, I’m telling you — 
I’m not going to die.” 

“If you can only live with 
her, I don’t care if you do 
die!” Janet said crying. As 
usual, she could keep her end 
up so long, no longer. She 
turned blindly toward the 
door. 

And Vee made her first 
mistake. “That’s all she cares, 
Walt,” she said. “As far as 
she’s concerned, you can die 
right now.” 

Janet spun around, finding 
more courage from some- 
where. “No,” she said broken- 
ly. “No, I was wrong. If she 
can really cure you, Walt, 
stay with her. I can’t do any- 
thing for you. I never could, 
could I?” 

Vee laughed with sudden 
joy. 

IN A BODY 



She thought she had won. 
But she had lost. 

J ANET was in Walt’s arms 
and her tears weren’t en- 
tirely tears of grief. Vee felt 
their love for each other, a 
bond that shut her out, a rec- 
onciliation which had noth- 
ing to do with facts or 
explanations. 

“I need more treatment, 
honey,” Walt said. “She says 
I don’t get it unless I marry 
her.” 

Vee tried the old, unan- 
swerable, logical argument 
again. “With Janet, you die. 
And you won’t marry Janet 
unless you live. You’d decided 
that before you ever heard of 
me. What’s changed?” 

“Janet, you were right and 
I was wrong,” Walt said 
softly. “Vee showed me that. 
I’d rather go with you, and 
die, than with her and live.” 
Vee’s shoulders slumped 
and her figure suddenly was- 
n’t fabulous any more. 

It was physical, mental and 
spiritual, this need of her race 
to have a soulmate. In the 
end it would be physically 
that she would die, but not 
until the two other sides of 
her had already disintegrated. 

She could hold out so long, 
as a man could hold out so 
long without food or water, 
getting weaker all the time. 
But since the mental part 
was so important, dissolution 
could be rapid. 

It wasn’t selfish, the love of 

35 




Vee’s race. It had to go out 
and come back. From Walt it 
had never really come back — 
yet with the confidence that 
it soon would, Vee had been 
able to carry on. The moment 
she knew, however, knew 
with complete certainty that 
Walt was not for her, she felt 
all the staggering weight of 
all these lonely weeks, empty 
of everything but hope. 

She couldn’t fight any more. 
She could hardly speak. 

“Go away, both of you," 
she said weakly. “Walt, you 
won’t die. You don’t need any 
more treatment." 

Janet emerged from Walt’s 
arms, blinking, to stare at 
Vee in dawning realization. 
“You did love him," she mur- 
mured. “You really do love 
him.” 

“Go away," Vee said, drop- 
ping loosely in a chair. 

“Are you all right, Vee?” 
Walt said, suddenly solicit- 
ous. It seemed incredible that 
only a few minutes before 
Vee had been dominating the 
situation, and they had both 
hated and feared her. 

“Yes. Go away. You’ll be 
all right, Walt.” 

They didn’t press their 
luck. They almost tiptoed out, 
arms around each other. 

For a long time Vee didn't 
move. But even in her des- 
pair she hadn’t quite lost her 
instinct for self-preservation, 
the unthinking urge to make 
one last try. And it would be 
the last one. 

3 6 



Others like Walt might 
have called at 179 Buckwash 
Street and left their ad- 
dresses. If everything went, 
right, if she found the right 
one that night, she still 
wouldn’t be finished. She had 
to find reason to hope again 
within the next few hours. 
Failing that, she wouldn’t 
wait for lingering physical 
death. 

She dragged herself to her 
feet, went into the bedroom 
and changed into the first 
street dress she could find. 
Too tired to switch off the 
lights, she left them burning 
as she went out. 

“You ill, lady?” the cab- 
bie asked her. 

“Just tired,” she said. 

T HE cab didn’t leave until 
she had climbed the steps 
at Buckwash Street. The taxi 
driver wasn’t sure he should 
leave her. 

It was still only nine-thirty. 
Nobody would be in bed yet. 

“Callers?” Mrs. Decker 
said. “There was that young 
man I sent down to the base- 
ment a day or two ago. Did 
you see him?” 

“Yes, I did,” said Vee, and 
she dragged herself upstairs. 
There was plenty of stuff in 
her apartment which would 
do. What would kill a human 
would kill Vee too. 

There wouldn’t be any up- 
roar afterwards. Even a 
real thorough post-mortem 
wouldn’t be likely to show 

j. t. McIntosh 




anything strange about the 
mortal remains of Vee Brown. 
And young women were often 
found dead in their lonely 
apartments. 

Suddenly she was being 
supported. “What’s the mat- 
ter, Miss Brown?” she was 
asked. 

It was Billy Clark, anxious, 
concerned. 

“I’m tired,” she said, “ter- 
ribly tired.” 

He helped her to her room, 
opened the door for her, sup- 
ported her to the solitary 
armchair. His eyes expressed 
his worry. They were friendly 
eyes. 

She managed to smile. “I’ll 
be all right, Mr. Clark,” she 
said. “I’ve been on my feet too 
long, that’s all.” 

He squared his shoulders. 
“Miss Brown,” he said, “I’ve 
been trying to talk to you 
since you came. You don’t 
know many people in town, 
do you?” 

“I don’t know anybody,” 
she said bleakly. 

“You know me,” he said. 
“I was wondering ... if may- 
be you’d like to see a show 
sometime, or something?” 

“See a show?” she repeated 
quizzically. 

“Well, I thought you might 
not have anybody special,” he 
said defensively. “And I’m not 
so dumb once I get to know 
people. You won’t know about 
this, being the kind of girl you 
are, but I get so nervous try- 
ing to speak to a girl that I 

UN A BODY 



usually walk right on past 
her. Isn’t that silly?” 

“No,” said Vee. 

“The trouble is, if you’re 
shy you get hurt, and then 
the next time you’re still more 
shy, more afraid of being 
hurt. So that’s why I wanted 
to ask you first — is there any- 
body? I mean ...” 

“Nobody,” said Vee. “No- 
body at all.” 

“Then maybe . .” 

“Billy,” said Vee quietly, 
“I’d never hurt you.” 

U NDERSTANDING dawn- 
ed in his face. “You’ve been 
hurt too. You’re like me. Vee, 
I knew it somehow. I knew 
somehow that though you 
looked like a girl with the 
world at her feet, you needed 
somebody just like I do. Vee, 
you and I could . .” 

Afraid of rebuff for going 
too far, he stopped abruptly, 
coloring. 

This was the way they did 
it. They hurt each other some- 
times, for there was never 
any guarantee that what one 
would feel, the other would 
feel. But this was how it hap- 
pened — not by bargains, not 
by reason, not by hard logic. 

“It’s a fine night,” said Vee 
softly. “How about us going 
out for a walk?” 

He was delighted. “But . 
surely you’re too tired?” 

Vee jumped to her feet. 
“Suddenly, Billy,” she said, 
“I’m not tired any more.”

Life’s but a walking shadow 



— says the Bard — but this 



Player was heard forever! 



I T is perhaps a pity that 
nothing is known of An- 
drew Benson’s parents. 

The same reasons which 
prompted them to leave him 
as a foundling on the steps of 
the St. Andrews Orphanage 
also caused them to maintain 
a discreet anonymity. The 
event occurred on the morn- 
ing of March 3rd, 1943 — the 
war era, as you probably re- 
call — so, in a way, the child 
may be regarded as a wartime 
casualty. Similar occurrences 

38 



were by no means rare during 
those days, even in Pasadena, 
where the Orphanage was 
located. 

After the usual tentative 
and fruitless inquiries, the 
good sisters took him in. It was 
there that he acquired his first 
name, from the patron and 
patronymic saint of the estab- 
lishment. The “Benson” was 
added some years later, by the 
couple who eventually adopted 
him. 

It is difficult, at this late 




date, to determine what sort 
of a child Andrew was. Or- 
phanage records are sketchy, 
at best, and Sister Rosemarie, 
who acted as supervisor of the 
boys’ dormitory, is long since 
dead. Sister Albertine, the 
primary grades teacher of the 
Orphanage School, is now — to 
put it as delicately as possible 
— in her senility, and her tes- 
timony is necessarily colored 
by knowledge of subsequent 
events. 

That Andrew never learned 
to talk until he was almost 
seven years old seems almost 
incredible. The forced gregari- 
ousness and the conspicuous 
lack of individual attention 
characteristic of orphanage 
upbringing would make it ap- 
pear as though the ability to 
speak is necessary for actual 
survival in such an environ- 
ment. Scarcely more credible 
is Sister Albertine’s theory 
that Andrew knew how to talk 
but merely refused to do so. 

For what it is worth, she 
remembers him as an unusual- 
ly precocious youngster, who 
appeared to posssess an intel- 
ligence and understanding far 
beyond his years. Instead of 
employing speech, however, he 
relied on pantomime, an art at 
which he was so brilliantly 
adept (if Sister Albertine is 
to be believed) that his mute- 
ness was hardly noticed. 

“He could imitate anybody,” 
she declares. “The other chil- 
dren, the Sisters, even the 
Mother Superior. Of course I 



had to punish him for that. 
But it was remarkable, the 
way he was able to pick up 
all the little mannerisms and 
facial expressions of another 
person, just at a glance. And 
that’s all it took for Andrew. 
Just a glance. 

“Visitor’s Day was Sunday. 
Naturally, Andrew never had 
any visitors, but he liked to 
hang around the corridor and 
watch them come in. And aft- 
erwards, in the dormitory at 
night, he’d put on a regular 
performance for the other 
boys. He could impersonate 
every single man, woman or 
child who’d come to the Or- 
phanage that day — the way 
they walked, the way they 
moved, every action and ges- 
ture. Even though he never 
said a word, nobody made the 
mistake of thinking Andrew 
was mentally deficient. For a 
while, Dr. Clement had the 
idea he might be a mute.” 

D R. Roger Clement is one 
of the few persons who 
might be able to furnish more 
objective data concerning 
Andrew Benson’s early years. 
Unfortunately, he passed 
away in 1954 ; victim of a fire 
which also destroyed his home 
and his office files. 

It was Dr. Clement who at- 
tended Andrew on the night 
that he saw his first motion 
picture. 

The date was 1949, some 
Saturday evening in the late 
fall of the year. The Orphan- 

39 











ROBERT BLOCH 



age received and showed one 
film a week, and only children 
of school age were permitted 
to attend. Andrew’s inability 
— or unwillingness — to speak 
had caused some difficulty 
when he entered primary 
grades that September, and 
several months went by before 
he was allowed to join his 
classmates in the auditorium 
for the Saturday night screen- 
ings. But it is known that he 
eventually did so. 

The picture was the last 
(and probably the least) of 
the Marx Brothers movies. Its 
title was Love Happy, and if 
it is remembered by the gen- 
eral public at all today, that 
is due to the fact that the film 
contained a brief walk-on ap- 
pearance by a then-unknown 
blonde bit player named Mari- 
lyn Monroe. 

But the Orphanage audi- 
ence had other reasons for 
regarding it as memorable, for 
Love Happy was the picture 
that sent Andrew Benson into 
his trance. 

Long after the lights came 
up again in the auditorium, 
the child sat there, immobile, 
his eyes staring glassily at the 
blank screen. When his com- 
panions noticed and sought to 
arouse him he did not respond. 
One of the Sisters (possibly 
Sister Rosemarie) shook him. 
He promptly collapsed in a 
dead faint. Dr. Clement was 
summoned, and he adminis- 
tered to the patient. Andrew 
Benson did not recover con- 



sciousness until the following 
morning. 

And it was then that he 
talked. 

He talked immediately, he 
talked perfectly, he talked flu- 
ently — but he did not talk in 
the manner of a six-year-old 
child. The voice that issued 
from his lips was that of a 
middle-aged man. It was a 
nasal, rasping voice, and even 
without the accompanying 
grimaces and facial expres- 
sions it was instantly and un- 
mistakably recognizable as the 
voice of Groucho Marx. 

Andrew Benson mimicked 
Groucho in his Sam Grunion 
role to perfection, word for 
word. Then he “did” Chico 
Marx. After that he relapsed 
into silence again. For a mo- 
ment it was thought he had re- 
verted to his mute phase. But 
it was an eloquent silence, and 
soon it was understood. He 
was imitating Harpo. In rapid 
succession, Andrew created 
recognizable vocal and visual 
portraits of Raymond Burr, 
Melville Cooper, Eric Blore 
and the other actors who play- 
ed small roles in the picture. 
His impersonations seemed 
uncanny to his companions. 
Even the Sisters were im- 
pressed. 

“Why, he even looked like 
Groucho,” Sister Albertine in- 
sists. 

I GNORING the question of 
how a towheaded moppet 
of six can achieve a physical 



TALENT 



41 




resemblance to Groucho Marx 
without makeup, it is never- 
theless an established fact 
that Andrew Benson gained 
immediate celebrity as the 
official mimic of the Orphan- 
age. 

From that moment on, he 
talked regularly, if not freely. 
That is to say, he replied to di- 
rect questions. He recited his 
lessons in the classroom. He 
responded with the outward 
forms of politeness required 
by Orphanage discipline. But 
he was never loquacious, or 
even communicative, in the 
ordinary sense. The only time 
he became spontaneously ar- 
ticulate was immediately fol- 
lowing the showing of the 
weekly movie. 

There was no recurrence of 
his initial seizure, but each 
Saturday night show brought 
in its wake a complete dra- 
matic recapitulation by the 
gifted youngster. During the 
fall of ’49 and the winter of 
*50, Andrew Benson saw many 
movies. There was Sorrowful 
Jones, with Bob Hope; Tar- 
zan’s Magic Fountain; The 
Fighting O’ Flynn; The Life of 
Riley; Little Women, and a 
number of other films, current 
and older. Naturally, these 
pictures were subject to ap- 
proval by the Sisters before 
being shown. Movies empha- 
sizing violence were not in- 
cluded. Still, several westerns 
reached the Orphanage screen, 
and it is significant that An- 
drew Benson reacted in what 



was to become a characteristic 
fashion. 

“Funny thing,” declares Al- 
bert Dominguez, who attend- 
ed the Orphanage during the 
same period as Andrew Ben- 
son and is one of the few per- 
sons located who is willing to 
admit, let alone discuss, the 
fact. “At first Andy imitated 
everybody — all the men, that 
is. He never imitated none of 
the women. But after he start- 
ed to see Westerns, it got so 
he was choosey, like. He just 
imitated the villains. I don’t 
mean like when us guys was 
playing cowboys — you know, 
when one guy is the sheriff 
and one is a gun-slinger. I 
mean, he imitated villains all 
the time. He could talk like 
’em, he could even look like 
’em. We use to razz hell out 
of him, you know?” 

It is probably as a result of 
the “razzing” that Andrew 
Benson, on the evening of May 
17th, 1950, attempted to slit 
the throat of Frank Phillips 
with a table-knife. Still, Al- 
bert Dominguez claims that 
the older boy offered no prov- 
ocation. His view is that An- 
drew Benson was exactly du- 
plicating the screen role of a 
western desperado in an old 
Charles Starrett movie. 

The incident was hushed up 
and no action taken. 

We have little information 
on Andrew Benson’s growth 
and development between the 
summer of 1950 and the au- 
tumn of 1955. Dominguez left 



42 



ROBERT BLOCH 




the Orphanage, nobody else 
appears willing to testify, and 
Sister Albertine had retired 
to a rest-home. As a result, 
there is nothing available con- 
cerning what may well have 
been Andrew’s crucial, forma- 
tive years. The meager rec- 
ords of his classwork seem sat- 
isfactory enough, and there is 
nothing to indicate that he 
was a disciplinary problem to 
his instructors. In June of 
1955 he was photographed 
with the rest of his classmates 
upon the occasion of gradua- 
tion from Eighth Grade. 

His face is a mere blur, an 
almost blank smudge in a 
sea of pre-adolescent counte- 
nances. What he actually look- 
ed like at that age is hard to 
tell. 

The Bensons thought that 
he resembled their son, David. 

L ITTLE David Benson had 
died of polio in 1953. Two 
years later his parents came 
to St. Andrews Orphanage 
seeking to adopt a boy. They 
had David’s picture with 
them. They were frank to 
state that they sought a physi- 
cal resemblance as a guide to 
making their choice. 

Did Andrew Benson see 
that photograph? Did — as has 
been subsequently theorized 
by certain irresponsible alarm- 
ists — he see certain home 
movies which the Bensons had 
taken of their child? 

We must confine ourselves 
to the known facts ; which are, 

talb-it 



simply, that Mr. and Mrs. 
Louis Benson, of Pasadena, 
California, legally adopted An- 
drew Benson, aged 12, on De- 
cember 9th, 1955. 

Andrew Benson went to live 
in their home, as their son. He 
entered the public high school. 
He became the owner of a bi- 
cycle. He received an allow- 
ance of one dollar a week. And 
he went to the movies. 

Andrew Benson went to the 
movies, and there were no re- 
strictions at all. For several 
months, that is. During this 
period he saw comedies, dra- 
mas, westerns, musicals, melo- 
dramas. He must have seen 
melodramas. Was there a film, 
released early in 1956, in 
which an actor played the role 
of a gangster who pushed a 
victim out of a second-story 
window? 

Knowing what we do today, 
we must suspect that there 
must have been. But at the 
time, when the actual incident 
occurred, Andrew Benson was 
exonerated. He and the other 
boy had been “scuffling” in a 
classroom after school, and 
the boy had “accidentally fall- 
en.” At least, this is the official 
version of the affair. The boy 
— now Pvt. Raymond Schuy- 
ler, USMC — maintains to this 
day that Benson deliberately 
tried to kill him. 

“He was spooky, that kid,” 
Schuyler insists. “None of us 
ever really got close to him. It 
was like there was nothing to 
get close to, you know? I 

43 




mean, he kept changing off. 
From one day to the next you 
could never figure out what he 
was going to be like. Of 
course, we all knew he imitat- 
ed these movie actors. He was 
only a freshman but already 
he was a big shot in the dra- 
matic club. But he imitated all 
the time. One minute he’d be 
real quiet, and the next, 
wham! You know that story, 
the one about Jekyll and 
Hyde ? Well, that was Andrew 
Benson. Afternoon he grab- 
bed me, we weren’t even talk- 
ing to each other. He just 
came up to me at the window 
and I swear to God he changed 
right before my eyes. It was 
as if he all of a sudden got 
about a foot taller and fifty 
pounds heavier, and his face 
was real wild. He pushed me 
out of the window, without 
one word. Of course, I was 
scared spitless, and maybe I 
just thought he changed. I 
mean, nobody can actually do 
a thing like that, can they ?” 
This question, if it arose at 
all at the time, remained un- 
answered. We do know that 
Andrew Benson was brought 
to the attention of Dr. Hans 
Fahringer, child psychiatrist 
and part-time guidance coun- 
selor at the school, and that 
his initial examination dis- 
closed no apparent abnormali- 
ties of personality or behav- 
ior-patterns. Dr. Fahringer 
did, however, have several 
long talks with the Bensons. 
As a result Andrew was for- 



bidden to attend motion pic- 
tures. The following year Dr. 
Fahringer voluntarily offered 
to examine young Andrew. 
Undoubtedly his interest had 
been aroused by the amazing 
dramatic abilities the boy was 
showing in his extra-curricu- 
lar activities at the school. 

O NLY one such interview 
ever took place, and it is 
to be regretted that Dr. Fah- 
ringer neither committed his 
findings to paper nor commu- 
nicated them to the Bensons 
before his sudden, shocking 
death at the hands of an un- 
known assailant. It is believed 
(or was believed by the police, 
at the time) that one of his 
former patients, committed to 
an institution as a psychotic 
and subsequently escaped, may 
have been guilty of the crime. 

All that we know is that it 
occurred some short while fol- 
lowing a local re-run of Man 
in the Attic. In this film Jack 
Palance essayed the role of 
Jack the Ripper. 

It is interesting, today, to 
examine some of the so-called 
“horror movies’’ of those 
years, including the re-runs 
of earlier vehicles starring 
Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, 
Peter Lorre and a number of 
other actors. 

We cannot say with any 
certainty, of course, that An- 
drew Benson was violating the 
wishes of his foster-parents 
and secretly attending motion 
pictures. But if he did, it is 



44 



ROBERT BLOCH 




quite likely that he would fre- 
quent the smaller neighbor- 
hood houses, many of which 
specialized in re-runs. And we 
do know, from the remarks of 
fellow-classmates during those 
high-school years, that “Andy” 
was familiar — almost omnis- 
ciently so — with the manner- 
isms of these performers. 

The evidence is often con- 
flicting. Joan Charters, for 
example, is willing to “swear 
on a stack of Bibles” that An- 
drew Benson, at the age of 15, 
was “a dead ringer for Peter 
Lorre — the same bug eyes and 
everything.” Whereas Nick 
Dossinger, who attended class- 
es with Benson a year later, 
insists that he “looked just 
like Boris Karloff.” 

Granted that adolescence 
may bring about a consider- 
able increase in height during 
the period of a year, it is 
nevertheless difficult to imag- 
ine how a “dead ringer for 
Peter Lorre” could meta- 
morphize into an asthenic 
Karloff type. 

A mass of testimony is 
available concerning Andrew 
Benson during those years, 
but almost all of it deals with 
his phenomenal histrionic tal- 
ent and his startling skill at 
“ad lib” impersonation of mo- 
tion picture actors. Apparent- 
ly he had given up mimicking 
his associates and contempo- 
raries almost entirely. 

“He said he liked to do ac- 
tors better, because they were 
bigger,” said Don Brady, who 

TALENT 



appeared with him in the Sen- 
ior Play. “I asked him what he 
meant by ‘bigger’ and he said 
it was just that. Actors were 
bigger on the screen. Some- 
times they were twenty feet 
tall. He said, ‘Why bother with 
little people when you can be 
big?’ He was a real offbeat 
character, that one.” 

The phrases recur. “Odd- 
ball.” “Screwball.” “Real 
gone.” They are picturesque, 
but hardly enlightening. And 
there seems to be little recol- 
lection of Andrew Benson as a 
friend or classmate, in the or- 
dinary roles of adolescence. 
It’s the imitator who is re- 
membered, with admiration 
and, frequently, with distaste 
bordering on actual apprehen- 
sion. 

“He was so good he scared 
you. But that’s when he was 
doing those impersonations, of 
course. The rest of the time, 
you scarcely knew he was 
around.” 

“Classes? I guess he did all 
right. I didn’t notice him 
much.” 

“Andrew was a fair stu- 
dent. He could recite when 
called upon, but he never vol- 
unteered. His marks were 
average. I got the impression 
he was rather withdrawn.” 
“No, he never dated much. 
Come to think of it, I don’t 
think he went out with girls 
at all. I never paid much at- 
tention to him, except when 
he was on stage, of course.” 

“I wasn’t really what you 

45 




call close to Andy. I don’t 
know anybody who seemed 
to be friends with him. He 
was so quiet, outside of the 
dramatics. And when he got 
up there, it was like he was a 
different person. He was real 
great, you know? We all fig- 
ured he’d end up at the Pasa- 
dena Playhouse.” 

T HE reminiscences of his 
contemporaries are fre- 
quently apt to touch upon mat- 
ters which did not directly in- 
volve Andrew Benson. The 
years 1956 and 1957 are still 
remembered, by high school 
students of the area in partic- 
ular, as the years of the cur- 
few. It was a voluntary cur- 
few, of course, but it was 
nevertheless strictly observed 
by most of the female students 
during the period of the 
“werewolf murders” — that se- 
ries of savage, still-unsolved 
crimes which terrorized the 
community for well over a 
year. Certain cannibalistic as- 
pects of the slaying of the five 
young women led to the 
“werewolf” appellation on the 
part of the sensation-monger- 
ing press. The Wolf Man se- 
ries made by Universal had 
been revived, and perhaps this 
had something to do with the 
association. 

But to return to Andrew 
Benson: he grew up, went to 
school, and lived the normal 
life of a dutiful step-son. If 
his foster-parents were a bit 
strict, he made no complaints. 

46 



If they punished him because 
they suspected he sometimes 
slipped out of his room at 
night, he made no complaints 
or denials. If they seemed ap- 
prehensive lest he be disobey- 
ing their set injunctions not 
to attend the movies, he offer- 
ed no overt defiance. 

The only known clash be- 
tween Andrew Benson and his 
family came about as a result 
of their flat refusal to allow a 
television set in their home. 
Whether or not they were con- 
cerned about the possible 
encouragement of Andrew’s 
mimicry or whether they had 
merely developed an allergy 
to Lawrence Welk is difficult 
to determine. Nevertheless, 
they balked at the acquisition 
of a TV receiver. Andrew beg- 
ged and pleaded, pointing out 
that he “needed” television as 
an aid to a future dramatic 
career. His argument had 
some justification for, in his 
senior year, Andrew had in- 
deed been “scouted” by the 
famous Pasadena Playhouse, 
and there was even some talk 
of a future professional career 
without the necessity of form- 
al training. 

But the Bensons were ada- 
mant on the television ques- 
tion; they remained adamant 
right up to the day of their 
death. 

This unfortunate circum- 
stance occurred at Balboa, 
where the Bensons owned a 
small cottage and maintained 
a little cabin-cruiser. The 



ROBERT BLOCH 




elder Bensons and Andrew 
were heading for Catalina 
Channel when it overturned 
in choppy waters. Andrew 
managed to cling to the craft 
until rescued, but his foster- 
parents were gone. It was a 
common enough accident ; 
you’ve probably seen some- 
thing just like it in the movies 
a dozen times. 

Andrew, just turned eight- 
teen, was left an orphan once 
more — but an orphan in full 
possession of a lovely home, 
and with the expectation of 
coming into a sizable inherit- 
ance when he reached twenty- 
one. The Benson estate was 
administered by the family at- 
torney, Justin L. Fowler, and 
he placed young Andrew on an 
allowance of forty dollars a 
week — an amount sufficient 
for a recent graduate of high 
school to survive on, but hard- 
ly enough to maintain him in 
luxury. 

I T is to be feared that violent 
scenes were precipitated 
between the young man and 
his attorney. There is no point 
in recapitulating them here, 
or in condemning Fowler for 
what may seem — on the sur- 
face — to be the development 
of a fixation. 

But up until the night that 
he was struck down by a hit- 
and-run driver in the street 
before his house, Attorney 
Fowler seemed almost ob- 
sessed with the desire to prove 
that the Benson lad was legal- 

TALENT 



ly incompetent, or worse. In- 
deed, it was his investigations 
which led to the uncovering of 
what few facts are presently 
available concerning the life 
of Andrew Benson. 

Certain other hypotheses — 
one hesitates to dignify them 
with the term, “conclusions” 
— he apparently extrapolated 
from these meager findings, 
or fabricated out of thin air. 
Unless, of course, he did man- 
age to discover details which 
he never actually disclosed. 
Without the support of such 
details there is no way of 
authenticating what seem to 
be fantastic conjectures. 

A random sampling, as re- 
membered from various con- 
versations Fowler had with 
the authorities, will suffice. 

“I don’t think the kid is 
even human, for that matter. 
Just because he showed up on 
those orphanage steps, you 
call him a foundling. Change- 
ling might be a better word 
for it. Yes, I know they don’t 
believe in such things any 
more. And if you talk about 
life-forms from other planets, 
they laugh at you and tell you 
to join the Fortean Society. 
So happens I’m a member in 
good standing. 

“Changeling? It’s probably 
a more accurate term than the 
narrow meaning implies. I’m 
talking about the way he 
changes when he sees these 
movies. No, don’t take my 
word for it— -ask anyone who’s 
ever seen him act. Better still, 

47 




ask those who never saw him 
on a stage, but just watched 
him imitate movie perform- 
ers in private. You’ll find out 
he did a lot more than just 
imitate. He became the actor. 
Yes, I mean he underwent 
an actual physical transforma- 
tion. Chameleon. Or some 
other form of life. Who can 
say? 

“No, I don’t pretend to 
understand it. I know it’s not 
'scientific’ according to the 
way you define science. But 
that doesn’t mean it’s impos- 
sible. There are a lot of life- 
forms in the universe, and we 
can only guess at some of 
them. Why shouldn’t there be 
one that’s abnormally sensi- 
tive to mimicry? 

“You know what effect the 
movies can have on so-called 
‘normal’ human beings, under 
certain conditions. It’s a hyp- 
notic state, this movie-view- 
ing, and you can ask the psy- 
chologists for confirmation. 
Darkness, concentration, sug- 
gestion — all the elements are 
present. And there’s post- 
hypnotic suggestion, too. 
Again, psychiatrists will back 
me up on that. Most people 
tend to identify with various 
characters on the screen. 
That's where our hero-wor- 
ship comes in, that’s why we 
have western-movie fans, and 
detective fans, and all the rest. 
Supposedly ordinary people 
come out of the theatre and 
fantasy themselves as the 
heroes and heroines they saw 

48 



up there on the screen; imi- 
tate them, too. 

“That’s what Andrew Ben- 
son did, of course. Only sup- 
pose he could carry it one 
step further? Suppose he 
was capable of being what he 
saw portrayed? And he chose 
to be the villains? I tell you, 
it’s time to investigate those 
killings of a few years back, 
all of them. Not just the mur- 
der of those girls, but the 
murder of the two doctors who 
examined Benson when he was 
a child, and the death of his 
foster-parents, too. I don’t 
think any of these things were 
accidents. I think some people 
got too close to the secret, and 
Benson put them out of the 
way. 

“Why? How should I know 
why? Any more than I know 
what he’s looking for when he 
watches the movies. But he’s 
looking for something, I can 
guarantee that. Who knows 
what purpose such a life-form 
can have, or what he intends 
to do with his power? All I 
can do is warn you.” 

I T IS easy to dismiss At- 
torney Fowler as a para- 
noid type, though perhaps it 
is unfair, in that we cannot 
evaluate the reasons for his 
outburst. That he knew (or 
believed he knew) something 
is self-evident. As a matter 
of fact, on the very evening of 
his death he was apparently 
about to set down his findings 
on paper. 



ROBERT BLOCH 




Deplorably, all that he ever 
set down was a preamble. 
It is a quotation from Eric 
Voegelin, concerning rigid 
pragmatic attitudes of “sci- 
entism”, so-called: 

“The assumption (1) that 
the mathematized science of 
natural phenomena is a model 
science to which all other sci- 
ences ought to conform; (2) 
that all realms of being are 
accessible to the methods of 
sciences of phenomena ; and 
(3) that all reality which is 
not accessible to sciences of 
phenomena is either irreve- 
lant or, in the more radical 
form of the dogma, illusion- 
ary.” 

But Attorney Fowler is 
dead, and we must deal with 
the living. 

With Max Schick, for ex- 
ample. He is the motion pic- 
ture and television agent who 
visited Andrew Benson at his 
home shortly after the death 
of the elder Bensons, and of- 
fered him an immediate con- 
tract. 

“You’re a natural,” Schick 
declared. “Never mind with 
the Pasadena Playhouse bit. I 
can spot you right now, be- 
lieve me! With what you got, 
we’ll back Brando right off the 
map ! Of course, we gotta start 
small, but I know just the 
gimmick. Main thing is to 
establish you in a starring 
slot right away. None of this 
stock-contract jazz, get me? 
The studios aren’t handing 
’em out in the first place, and 

TALENT 



even if you landed one, you'd 
end up on Cloud Nowhere. 
No, the deal is to get you a 
lead and billing right off the 
bat. And like I said, I got the 
angle. 

“We go to a small indie 
producer, get it? Must be a 
dozen of ’em operating right 
now, and all of ’em making 
the same thing. Only one kind 
of picture that combines low 
budgets with big grosses, and 
that’s a science fiction movie. 
You’ve seen them. 

“Yeah, you heard me, a 
science fiction movie. Whad- 
dya mean, you never saw one? 
Are you kidding? How about 
that? You mean you never 
saw any science fiction pic- 
tures at all ? 

“Oh, your folks, eh? Had 
to sneak out? And they only 
show that kind of stuff at the 
downtown houses? 

“Well look, kid, it’s about 
time, that’s all I can say. It's 
about time ! Hey, just so’s you 
know what we’re talking 
about, you better get on the 
ball and take in one right 
away. 

“Sure, I’m positive, there 
must be one playing a down- 
town first run now. Why don’t 
you go this afternoon? I got 
some work to finish up here 
at the office — run you down 
in my car, you can go on to 
the show, meet me back there 
when you get out. 

“Sure, you can take the car 
after you drop me off. Be my 




S O Andrew Benson saw his 
first science fiction movie. 
He drove there and back in 
Max Schick’s car. Coinciden- 
tally enough, it was the late 
afternoon of the day when 
Attorney Fowler became a 
hit-and-run victim. Schick has 
good reason to remember 
Andrew Benson’s reappear- 
ance at his office just after 
dusk. 

“He had a look on his face 
that was out of this world,” 
Schick says. 

“ ‘How’d you like the pic- 
ture?’ I ask him.” 

“ ‘It was wonderful,’ he 
tells me. ‘Just what I’ve been 
looking for all these years. 
And to think I didn’t know.’ 
“ ‘Didn’t know what?’ I ask. 
But he isn’t talking to me any 
more. You can see that. He’s 
talking to himself.” 

“ ‘I thought there must be 
something like that,’ he says. 
‘Something better than Drac- 
ula, or Frankenstein’s mon- 
ster, or all the rest. Something 
bigger, more powerful. Some- 
thing I could really be. And 
now I know. And now I’m go- 
ing to.’ ” 



Max Schick is unable to 
maintain coherency from this 
point on. But his direct ac- 
count is not necessary. We 
are, unfortunately, all too well 
aware of what happened next. 

Max Schick sat there in his 
chair and watched Andrew 
Benson change. 

He watched him grow. He 
watched him put forth the 
eyes, the stalks, the writhing 
tentacles. He watched him 
twist and tower, filling the 
room and then overflowing 
until the flimsy stucco walls 
collapsed and there was noth- 
ing but the green, gigantic 
horror, the sixty-foot-high 
monstrosity that may have 
been born in a screenwriter’s 
brain or have been spawned 
beyond the stars, but certain- 
ly existed and drew nourish- 
ment from realms far from a 
three-dimensional world or 
three-dimensional concepts of 
sanity. 

Max Schick will never for- 
get that night and neither, of 
course, will anybody else. 

That was the night the mon- 
ster destroyed Los Angeles.

SYLVIA JACOBS Illustrated by RITTER 



ms 





S LICK Tennant had a 
hunch. The sixth sense that 
had made him king of the lo- 
cal rackets, that had warned 
him in time when three of his 
men fell to the machine guns 
of a rival gang, now told him 
that the Feds were after him, 
that they had evidence to send 
him up for a long stretch. But 
he was going where even the 
Feds couldn’t extradite him. 



Slick Tennant was going to 
hide in the future. 

They didn’t call him Slick 
for nothing. For months, a 
private dick in his pay had 
shadowed Dr. Richard Porter, 
inventor of a device called by 
reporters a time-travel ma- 
chine, by comedians a crystal 
ball, and by Dr. Porter’s fel- 
low-psychiatrists a Meta- 
chronoscope. Slick knew the 



52 






doctor was a widower, knew Strolling along the street, 
where he lived, knew pressure Slick might have been any 
could be put upon him citizen on his way home. A 
through Dickie Porter, aged hat shadowed his features as 
seven. In Slick’s pocket was a he passed under the street 
house-key Dr. Porter thought lights, and he carried a brief - 
he had lost two weeks ago. case. He hailed a cruising cab 
But Slick hadn’t disclosed and proceeded to a spot two 
his intentions to anyone. The blocks from the Porter home, 
chauffeur of his bullet-proof being careful not to tip too 
j car let him out several miles much or too little to attract 
from the Porter residence, the driver’s attention. 



53 




Dr. Porter propped an elbow 
on his pillow, trying to orient 
himself in the fuzziness that 
follows a midnight awaken- 
ing. He stifled a gasp, and sat 
up suddenly, as he saw that 
the man silhouetted against 
the living room lamp had pa- 
jama-clad Dickie by the arm. 
The child was rubbing his 
eyes, but there wasn’t a whim- 
per out of him. 

“I got a gun on the kid,” 
the man said. “I like kids 
and I won’t hurt him if you 
do what I say.” 

The doctor struggled to 
keep his voice soothing and 
professional. “Of course you 
wouldn’t,” he said. “You don’t 
want to go back to the hos- 
pital.” 

The man laughed. “I ain’t 
one of your nuts, Doc. And 
I don’t want your money. I 
got plenty. All I want from 
you is a little trip in your 
time machine.” 

“Metachronoscope,” correct- 
ed the doctor. “It’s very mis- 
leading to call it a time-travel 
machine.” 

L etting go of the boy, 
Slick dealt Dr. Porter a 
vicious slap. “That’ll learn you 
not to pull none of your high- 
brow stuff. Is it my fault I 
had to quit school to keep the 
family from starvin’ when my 
old man got sent up? If Slick 
Tennant says it’s a time-trav- 
el machine, that’s what you 
call it, see?” 

“Yes, I see,” Dr. Porter 

54 



said faintly. The mention of 
gangland’s most dreaded name 
had more effect on him than 
the blow. 

“Now let’s get something 
else straight. Once, on TV, 
they said a couple of guys 
came back. Another time, the 
news program said they could- 
n’t come back and give tips 
on the ponies. Which is right? 
Can you bring me back any 
time you want to?” 

“Absolutely not. The de- 
cision is irrevocable. The pub- 
lic’s impression that the 
future can be altered or pre- 
dicted is incorrect.” 

“Fine. I don’t want to come 
back. And I don’t need to 
change the future, neither. 
Things may be different, but 
a smart cookie can always get 
along. Now, according to the 
news, you only sent these guys 
ahead a year. That ain’t 
enough. What’s the most you 
could send me ahead?” 

“Theoretically, we could 
send a subject ahead as much 
as twenty years, if we could 
find anyone who would con- 
sent to that, and undoubtedly 
we could learn a great deal 
more by so doing.” 

“But you did find out that 
the boys come through okay?” 
“Yes. We sent these two 
men ahead in 1961. When they 
returned to awareness, it was 
1962. Physically and mentally 
they were as fit as before.” 
“Did they know what hap- 
pened to them?” 

“Well, the year had no ap- 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




parent duration for them, but 
they had normal speed mem- 
ories of the intervening year 
when they returned to aware- 
ness. Evidently their fore- 
memories for the entire year 
must have been condensed 
into the brief period they 
were in the field. From this 
phenomenon, we derive the 
term ‘sending the subjects 
ahead’ which has so often 
been misinterpreted. But it’s 
important to note that these 
condensed fore-memories were 
not available until twenty- 
four to forty-eight hours after 
the events, which means the 
future cannot be effectively 
predicted by present tech- 
niques.” 

That sounded like plain 
English; it sounded as if it 
meant something, but Slick 
wasn’t quite sure what. He 
seized on the last remark, 
which he understood. 

“What did you build this 
gadget for, if you can’t tell 
fortunes with it?” he asked. 

“The layman thinks in 
terms of immediate practical 
application. But our primary 
objective was knowledge of 
the human mind. We con- 
firmed the existence of men- 
tal capacities that have been 
suspected for centuries. We 
formulated the axiom that 
awareness is a function of 
subconscious fore-memories 
becoming currently available. 
We experimentally suspended 
awareness without inducing 
unconsciousness, by causing 

56 



the fore-memories to con- 
dense. I hope the process will 
develop into a useful tool for 
my profession, that we learn 
how to superimpose condition- 
ing on the blank area to 
produce rational, socially ac- 
ceptable action, rather than 
the literal and irrational com- 
pulsion which is a drawback 
to implanting post-hypnotic 
commands. But I can’t tell you 
at this point where our re- 
search will lead.” 

T HIS double-talk had Slick 
going around in circles. 
But he had a strong hunch 
that taking a trip in the ma- 
chine was the right thing to 
do, and he wasn’t going to let 
Porter divert him from that. 

“Let’s get down to cases, 
Doc. Just exactly what’s go- 
ing to happen to me when I 
get in this machine?” 

“It’s difficult to explain the 
process in lay terms, particu- 
larly under stress. But this 
may help you to understand 
it. Have you ever had the ex- 
perience of going back to 
sleep for a few moments after 
you awoke in the morning, 
and dreaming a long, involved 
dream?” 

“Sure. I get some good 
hunches that way.” 

“Then you know the dream 
may cover a period of hours, 
days, or even years. People 
in the dream move and speak 
at a normal speed. Yet when 
you awaken again and look at 
the clock, you see that only 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




a few minutes or even sec- 
onds have elapsed. A motion 
picture of the events in the 
dream would be nothing but 
a gabble and a blur, if pro- 
jected at such terriffic speed.” 
“Yeah, that’s right. I had 
that happen plenty of times, 
and I always thought it was 
kind of funny.” 

“It demonstrates the capac- 
ity of the human mind to 
function independently of the 
limitations of chronological 
time. And premonitory expe- 
riences — what you call hunch- 
es — give us an inkling of the 
fore-memory phenomenon. In 
our dreams, the past, future, 
literal and symbolical material 
mingles. But by subjecting the 
physical brain to a certain 
type of electro-magnetic field, 
we can isolate the fore-mem- 
ories, condensed as in the 
dream, while the subject acts 
as if in a waking state.” 
“Does it hurt when a guy’s 
brain goes into this field?” 
“Not at all. Awareness and 
physical sensations are totally 
suspended. The elapsing time 
has no apparent duration. 
That means you can’t feel any- 
thing at all, you don’t know 
what has happened until later, 
and twenty hours or even 
twenty years pass in a second, 
as far as your mind is con- 
cerned.” 

“Why in the hell didn’t you 
give me that straight, instead 
of dragging in all this dream 
business? That’s just what 
I’m looking for, just what I 

TIME PAYMENT 



figured it would be from the 
news stories. Do you throw 
this here field ahead or does 
the time machine travel along 
with the guy inside?” 

Dr. Porter sighed slightly. 
The man had a preconceived 
idea, and nothing Porter had 
said had altered it in the 
slightest. “The machine does- 
n’t actually travel,” he ex- 
plained patiently. “That’s why 
I objected to calling it a time- 
travel machine. It exists here 
and now and it will exist in 
the future, I suppose.” 

“You mean it’ll be there 
when I come out of the field?” 

“I said I suppose so. Why 
should that concern you, par- 
ticularly?” 

“Well, I’ll tell you. Slick 
Tennant pays off two ways. 
Maybe you only heard about 
the times he paid off guys for 
crossing him, but he pays off 
guys that help him, too. I'm 
paying for your help by giving 
you a chance to save your skin. 
I got a hand grenade in this 
briefcase. When I get through 
with that machine, I’m going 
to blow her to little, bitty 
pieces. Maybe you can’t bring 
me back, but I don’t want you 
to have the machine to send 
the cops after me, neither. By 
the time you get a new ma- 
chine built, my trail will be 
cold.” 

Intellectually, Dr. Porter 
accepted the concept of the in- 
evitability of events. If Slick 
was going to blow up the ma- 
chine, he was going to blow 

57 




it up. Still the old, old human 
habit of trying to control the 
future kept obstinately insin- 
uating itself. 

“But you don’t need to de- 
stroy the machine,” he pro- 
tested. “Look, let me try to 
explain — ” 

“I thought you’d try to talk 
me out of it,” Slick said omi- 
nously. “I know that a lot of 
money and work went into 
that gadget, but I got to blow 
her up. You should be glad 
you’re not on my list or you’d 
get blown up with her. And I 
got no time for any more 
talkin’. I found out all I want 
to know. Now, get up and get 
dressed, and make it snappy. 
You’re going to drive me over 
to the University.” 

Porter had been careful not 
to make any moves that might 
alarm his unbidden guest; he 
swung his feet obediently over 
the side of the bed. “Is Dickie 
going with us?” he asked. 

“You’re damned right he is. 
I don’t want you high-signing 
any cops on the way, and the 
kid might even be sharp 
enough to phone the station 
himself, if we left him here.” 
He didn’t add that he had an 
even better reason for taking 
the boy. 

“Then let him get some 
clothes on too. It’s cold out- 
side.” To his son. Dr. Porter 
added, “Don’t be afraid, 
Dickie. Everything is going to 
be all right.” 

“Sure, Daddy,” the boy said 
sturdily. “You just do like he 

58 



says. He’s like the bad guys on 
TV.” 

“You got a smart kid. Por- 
ter,” Slick said, grinning. 
“Knows when to keep his trap 
shut and what to say when he 
opens it. That’s more than 
some of the hoods in this town 
know.” 

D RIVING down the freeway 
toward the University 
campus, Slick and the boy sat 
in the back seat of Dr. Por- 
ter’s car. Slick tried the kid on 
his lap for size ; it was a nice 
fit. The papers said the time 
machine was a two-passenger 
job, but if that wasn’t the 
straight dope, Slick could hold 
the kid on his lap, like this. 

The gangster squeezed 
Dickie’s small hand. “You’re 
all right, boy. Plenty of guys 
a lot bigger than you would be 
bawlin’ if Slick Tennant in- 
vited them to take a little ride. 
If I ever have a kid of my own 
I’d want one just like you.” 
He tucked a bill in the pocket 
of Dickie’s jacket. “This is to 
buy you a play gat or some- 
thing.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Slick,” the 
boy said gravely. 

Though business compelled 
him to do things like rubbing 
out the competition, Slick was 
really soft-hearted. Some of 
the proceeds of his illicit activ- 
ities were devoted each year 
to buying Christmas trees, 
turkeys, and toys for poor 
children. He kind of hated to 
separate Dickie Porter from 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




his father, but it was the oiriy 
way he could see to insure a 
safe passage through time. 

And then, Slick reflected, he 
would have a kid of his own, 
or at least one he was respon- 
sible for. Slick decided then 
and there that he would send 
the boy to the fanciest high- 
class boarding school they had 
in the future, the kind the 
millionaire kids went to. 
Dickie would have a pony, a 
bike, a dog, plenty of fried 
chicken and strawberry short- 
cake, all the things Slick had 
yearned for in his own slum 
childhood. He would live in the 
country, where there were 
miles of fresh green grass to 
play on, and he would wear a 
silver-studded cowboy suit 
with real spurs. Unless the 
kids where they were going 
would be wearing space-pilot 
suits instead. By gosh, that 
would be something. Maybe 
Slick could take the kid on a 
luxury cruise to the Moon. 

To provide these things, 
Slick would have to follow the 
only trade he knew, move in 
on the local mobs. But he 
wouldn’t let Dickie mix with 
hoods and racketeers. Dickie 
would study to be something 
respectable, a mouthpiece or 
maybe a doctor like his old 
man. Dickie would have all the 
advantages a kid could ask for 
— everything except a real 
father. 

He might even have that, 
come to think of it. Dr. Porter 
might easily live another

twenty years, now that Slick 
had warned him to get away 
from the machine before it 
was blown up. First, Slick 
would get some plastic sur- 
gery, so Porter and any other 
old ducks who were still alive 
wouldn’t recognize him. There 
ought to be a lot of improve- 
ments in plastic surgery in 
twenty years. Probably a guy 
could even get his fingerprints 
changed. Then he would hire, 
a private dick to look up 
Porter. 

Slick pictured the aged fa- 
ther being reunited with the' 
son he’d lost twenty years be- 
fore, seeing the child just as 
he’d been at the moment 
of parting, with Slick play- 
ing Santa Claus in the back- 
ground, sending the kid a roll 
of thousand-dollar bills with 
a pink ribbon around it for a 
present. It was such a touch- 
ing thought that tears came to 
the gangster’s eyes, as they 
did when he watched a sad 
movie. 

He was sorry he couldn’t let 
Porter and the boy in on his 
plans right now, but he wasn’t 
ready to tip his hand. 

T HE machine was a two- 
passenger job, all right. 
Slick could tell that the min- 
ute he saw it. There was no 
enclosure, just two reclining 
barber chairs fixed on two cir- 
cular plates sunk in a plat- 
form. After the switch was 
set, Porter had explained, the 
additional weight of an occu- 

59 




pant of the chair would com- 
plete the contact and the field 
would build up. Slick exam- 
ined the control panel, partic- 
ularly the dial, which was 
calibrated into twenty sec- 
tions, each for a ninety-second 
exposure to the field. 

“You did say twenty years, 
didn’t you ?” Dr. Porter asked. 

“If that’s the limit,” Slick 
replied tersely, “like I heard.” 
“How old are you?” 

“You mean can my ticker 
take it? Well, I’m forty-five. 
They tell me I don't look it.” 
Slick was vain of his black 
hair, without a thread of gray 
in it. 

“No, you don’t look it. But 
let me take your pulse and 
blood pressure.” 

H E submitted, without let- 
ting go of either his gun 
or brief case. 

“You seem to be in good 
shape, as nearly as I can tell 
from a superficial examina- 
tion. But don’t you want to re- 
consider this twenty-year 
arrangement? I can’t change 
the setting once you’re in the 
chair, you know. Are you sure 
you understand that the only 
thing affected will be your 
own subjective experience, 
that time will go on just as it 
always has, but that you won’t 
be aware of anything between 
now and twenty years from 
now?” 

“Sure. You told me that 
three-four times already. What 
are you trying to do? Stall till 

60 



help gets here?” Slick asked 
suspiciously. 

“I’m not stalling,” the doc- 
tor said. “In fact, I’m only too 
glad to find someone to whom 
the present means so little that 
he’s willing to go into a 
twenty-year blank. But ethics 
insist that I warn you.” 

He turned the switch to the 
twenty-year mark. 

“I’m ready,” he said. 

“Whaddya mean, warn 
me?” Slick snapped. “Is this 
thing booby trapped?” 

“Certainly not. I have mere- 
ly tried to explain that it is 
not exactly what you antici- 
pated — ” 

“You know what I’m drivin’ 
at. Have you got the machine 
set to electrocute me or ex- 
plode the grenade? A lot of 
you respectable citizens don’t 
figure a guy like me is exactly 
human. You wouldn’t call it 
murder to rub me out. You’d 
think you was doin’ the town 
a favor.” 

“Some people would, per- 
haps, but I’m a doctor, not a 
judge. I’ve spent my life try- 
ing to find out what makes 
men like you act as they do, 
not in devising means of pun- 
ishing them. But even if I 
wanted to do you bodily harm, 
I couldn’t. The machine has a 
built-in safety factor.” 

This was where Slick 
sprang a little surprise. 

“You willing to bet your 
kid’s life on that?” he asked, 
picking up the boy. 

He took two steps toward 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




the platform, watching Por- 
ter’s reactions. If the father 
made a lunge toward the 
panel, Slick would know the 
setting was wrong. But Porter 
only stood stunned. The set- 
ting was safe, then, but Slick 
had only Porter’s word that it 
couldn’t be changed after con- 
tact. Maybe a change would 
be fatal to the passenger. So 
he would make sure there 
would be no changes. 

“I always take out travel in- 
surance, Doc,” Slick said, and, 
stepping onto the platform, he 
put the boy gently into one of 
the chairs and reclined in the 
pther himself. 

“Dickie!” Dr. Porter cried. 

It was the last thing Slick 
or the boy heard him say. 

S LICK came back to aware- 
ness of where he was and 
what he was doing. He was in 
one of the radial corridors, 
but at what compass point, at 
which level, and how many 
miles inside the outer walls of 
the city, he didn’t know. He 
ran his fingers in a puzzled 
manner through his hair. He 
had never quite figured out the 
lettering system of the “cir- 
cles” which weren’t actually 
circles, but multagons. 

He didn’t even know what 
time it was. In this perpetual 
mock daylight, there was no 
change; there were no varia- 
tions of seasons in this ster- 
ilized, irradiated, humidified, 
filtered, deodorized, oxygen- 
ated, constantly circulating

seventy-five degrees. He re- 
membered when streets used 
to have names, when you 
needed a street guide instead 
of a course in geometry to find 
your way around the city. He 
remembered when a city was 
many buildings, not one im- 
mense pyramid, when you 
wore dark glasses against the 
sun’s glare on the pavements, 
when a Santa Ana blew dust 
over everything or smog 
stung your eyes, when people 
drove their cars into the 
downtown congestion instead 
of leaving them on the out- 
skirts, when they said to each 
other, “There hasn’t been 
enough rain this year,” be- 
cause there was no weather 
control and water for the 
lawns came all the way from 
the Colorado instead of from 
the nearby Pacific. 

That was the trouble — his 
mind slipped back to the old 
days, his memories got out of 
sequence, and he wandered 
away from Recidivist Gar- 
dens, the only place he felt 
comfortable and at home. Dr. 
Tyson said it was because he 
had been in the field so long 
that time, twenty years ago. 

A young man was staring 
at him, and Slick looked down 
at himself. No wonder the 
young man was staring! To 
his shame. Slick saw that he 
was wearing some kind of 
clothes, and worst of all, he 
was wearing them inside the 
city ! Where had he found 
them? The only possible ex- 

61 




planation was that he had 
drawn them out on his 
museum card. These scram- 
bled-sequence attacks were 
becoming more embarrassing 
each time ! 

“Don’t act so flustered, 
Pop,” the young man said. 
“Nobody saw you but me. 
Take ’em off and I’ll put ’em 
in the lost-and-found chute for 
you. Or are you on your way 
to a costume ball ?” 

Slick looked over the railing 
of the balcony. There were 
several people waiting for ele- 
vators and radial cars on the 
level below all decently naked, 
of course, but the young man 
was right. Nobody else had 
seen Slick’s shame. Hurriedly, 
he stepped out of the uncom- 
fortable clothes and rolled 
them into a bundle. The young 
man took it from him. 

“You’re very kind — thank 
you so much,” Slick said. 

“Think nothing of it,” the 
young man said. “What ad- 
dress should I put on this 
stuff?” 

“Just Recidivist Gardens. 
They’ll take care of it in the 
office. I hope you don’t think 
all of us at the Gardens do 
peculiar things like this. It’s 
just that — well, it’s a long 
story, but they didn’t start my 
conditioning until I’d been in 
the blank five years. I’m not 
capable of anything really 
anti-social, you understand, 
but I get what they call se- 
quence scrambles. Sometimes 
I act as if I were living in the 

62 



past. I’m not crazy, though. 
The doctors at the Gardens as- 
sure me I’m not crazy.” 

“Of course you’re not,” the 
young man said soothingly. 
“But that’s a long blank — five 
years.” 

“I went the limit, really. 
Twenty years.” 

“Then you must be the man 
they call Slick!” 

“You’ve heard of my case?” 
“I was with you the night 
you made my father put us in 
the field.” 

“Dickie Porter! How you 
have grown! I’ve always told 
your father I didn’t want to 
meet you. He said if it was 
going to happen, it would, 
whether he introduced us or 
not. But I hate to face you, 
after taking such a large slice 
out of your life — ” 

“But I’m still young. You’re 
the one who’s had the worst of 
it, because when you come out 
of the blank, you won’t have 
so many years left. But you 
have the comfort of knowing 
you really did something 
worth while. Your case and 
mine have been invaluable to 
the research, particularly 
yours, because it was with you 
that my father developed the 
conditioning techniques. If it 
hadn’t been for you, it would 
have been very difficult to find 
anyone willing to draw a 
twenty-year blank.” 

“No. Not even a lifer would 
want that. But I don’t take 
any credit for it. I did it only 
because I was so bull-headed 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




I wouldn’t listen to what Dr. 
Porter was trying to tell me.” 
“I came out of it six months 
ago,” the young man said. 
“Now I can consciously hear, 
and feel, and smell, just like 
other people. I don’t have to 
wait till tomorrow to remem- 
ber what I said to somebody 
today, or what tonight’s din- 
ner tasted like.” 

<<T’M SO glad to hear that!” 
-J- Slick said. “Dr. Tyson says 
I should be coming out of it 
soon, too. Say, wait a minute 
— I heard what you said just 
now — I’m hearing what I said 
myself — why, I’ve had full 
sensory impressions for sev- 
eral minutes now, but it kind 
of sneaked up on me — ” 

The young man seized 
Slick’s hand and pumped it 
vigorously. “Congratulations ! 
You’re out of it!” 

“Oh, this is wonderful, won- 
derful! It’s like — like coming 
back to life. I must go home and 
tell Dr. Tyson at once ! Please 
go with me. It’ll do you good 
to get out of the city. We’re 
the only two people who’ve 
drawn such a long blank — we 
have so much in common. I’ll 
fix you a chicken dinner. I 
raise my own. Just think, to 
taste my own fried chicken !” 
“I wish I could go, but it’ll 
have to be some other time. I 
have a date for the opera. 
When you see it on the Tri-di- 
cast you’ll know my girl and 
I are in the studio audience.” 
“Oh. a girl!” Slick said. “Of 

TIME PAYMENT 



course there’d be a girl, now 
that you’re out of the blank. I 
won’t keep you. But there’s 
just one thing I must ask you 
— do you ever remember 
ahead? Consciously, that is?” 

“A few times. But the con- 
scious fore-memories are mix- 
ed with post-memories and 
impossible to place according 
to dates. It’s the same objec- 
tion that applies when people 
remember ahead in dreams — 
you don’t know which part of 
the dream is a fore-memory 
until it happens.” 

“Maybe some day they’ll 
learn to sort those conscious 
fore-memories out. If I could 
do it, I would know whether 
you are ever coming to see 
me.” 

“I will come,” the young 
man promised. “Believe me, I 
will.” 

Absorbed in his newly found 
sensations, Slick took the ele- 
vator a hundred and thirty- 
three floors to ground level, 
reminding himself not to go 
too far and wind up in one of 
the sixty levels below ground. 
Then he stopped the North-by- 
Northwest radial car and 
punched the button for city 
limits, thus avoiding the neces- 
sity of dealing with the circle 
lettering system. 

He sat in the speeding little 
car, watching the faces of the 
other passengers, until each, 
in turn, got off at their respec- 
tive stops. Got off to go to lux- 
urious apartments that were 
nothing more than cells, with 

63 




four-sided soundproofing sep- 
arating neighbor from neigh- 
bor, with air, newspapers, 
prepared meals and all other 
deliveries coming by chute. 
How could they bury them- 
selves in the ugly angularity 
of masonry and steel? How 
could they, who had always 
had full senses, deny them- 
selves the sting of wind, the 
scent of soil and grass, the 
sound and sight of ocean 
breakers? How the world had 
changed in his lifetime, with 
people who had never commit- 
ted anti-social acts imprison- 
ing themselves, while those 
who had needed conditioning 
enjoyed the therapy of free- 
dom. 

When the car reached city 
limits, the door opened auto- 
matically and Slick, the only 
passenger left, passed through 
the shower that sprayed his 
skin with a porous, temporary 
plastic coating against the 
chill outside air. He walked 
across the thick ground-cover, 
exquisitely aware of the sen- 
sation of softness under his 
feet, leaving the awesome bulk 
of the city behind. 

Before him swept the ex- 
panse of Recidivist Gardens, 
on gently rolling hills, border- 
ing the sea. Clearly though he 
remembered it, this was the 
first time he had seen it with 
full and immediate sensory 
impact. The moon silvered the 
foliage, cast a path upon the 
water. Here and there, lights 
were on in the cottages nestled 

64 



among the foliage, the domed, 
transparent cottages that com- 
bined the psychological effect 
of living outdoors with the 
comfort of shelter. The sweet 
note of a bell buoy clove the 
night. 

The beauty was almost un- 
bearable, coming so sharply 
to long blanked-out senses. 
The return of immediate 
awareness, and the knowledge 
that Dickie Porter, the only 
human being with whom he 
had a kinship of experience, 
did not hate him, was too 
much happiness for one day. 
Slick breathed deeply of the 
salt air, and felt a catch in his 
heart. He raised a thin hand 
to his chest. 

T HE young man who had 
spoken to Slick in the ra- 
dial corridor found the obitu- 
ary item in the newspaper he 
took from the chute with his 
breakfast next morning. 

Louis G. Tennant, 65, known 
to his friends as “Slick,” a resi- 
dent of Recidivist Gardens, died 
of a heart attack about 2200 last 
night, while returning to his 
home after a visit to central 
Ellay. 

Tennant was one of the first 
recidivists to benefit from the 
Porter socio-legal conditioning 
techniques, and was noted for 
his valuable contribution to sci- 
ence in volunteering in 1963 for 
a twenty-year blank. He was one 
of two men who have gone this 
far ahead, the other being Dr. 

SYLVIA JACOBS 




Porter's son, Richard S. Porter, 
Jr., level 72, SSE, circle XA, apt. 
1722. 

The Tennant case did much to 
direct public attention to the 
Porter techniques, helping to 
pave the way for a drastic revi- 
sion of the criminal statutes, and 
to establish the concept that 
punishment rather than treat- 
ment for anti-social acts is as 
barbarous as punishment rather 
than treatment for the insane. 

When informed of the death, 
and asked whether subconscious 
fore-memories of these develop- 
ments motivated Tennant to vol- 
unteer as a research subject, Dr. 
Richard Porter, U.C.L.A., said 
that the effect of subconscious 
fore-memories as a compulsion 
to action is as yet imperfectly 
understood. He stated, however, 
that in certain individuals, the 
fore-memory compulsive factor 
appears to operate closer to the 
conscious level than in others. He 
said that, before going into the 



blank, Tennant was noted for 
the strength and reliability of 
his “hunches.” He also recalled 
that Tennant and Richard Por- 
ter, Jr., were the last two sub- 
jects treated in the original 
Metachrono scope, which was de- 
stroyed shortly thereafter in an 
explosion. Subsequent models 
have been modified and improved. 

Tennant's estate was willed 
to the Recidivists' Christmas 
Fund for Dependent Children. 
According to Dr. Claude Tyson 
of Recidivist Hospital, Tennant 
was still in the blank when he 
died. 

The closing sentence of the 
item was wrong, Dick Porter 
thought. In his last hours, 
Slick had known how it felt to 
be alive again, after twenty 
years. 

Dick Porter was the only 
human being who fully appre- 
ciated what that meant.

WHAT, NEVER? 

A common belief among even the best educated and least dogmatic is 
that the human brain cannot possibly be outdone — ever — as the most 
compact computer. 

But cryogenics may make the human brain seem wastefully huge and 
cumbersome. Researchers at MIT are experimenting with cryotrons as 
computer components — and cryotrons, being smaller than the visible 
wave length of light, are far tinier than neurons. If successful, cryogenic 
computers could be warehoused by the untold number in the space of a 
human skull, for they would truly be subminiaturized brains. And the 
data they contained would all be available, whereas 90% of the human 
brain is not used, and much of the working 10% is non-computing in 
function.

THE 

LAST 

TRESPASSER 



By JIM HARMON 

T HEY would not believe 
Malloy was alone in there, 
in the padded cell. That made 
it worse. 

Malloy was in his month for 
lying on his stomach to avoid 
bed sores. He was walking 
from Peoria, Illinois, to De- 
troit, Michigan, currently and 
he had just reached Chicago. 
It was fine to see State Street 
again, and the jewelry stores 
stuck in the alcoves of 
churches with the handsomely 
barred windows. 

A man in Army-surplus 
green with an old library book 
was asking for carfare to a 



hiring hall when they began 
opening the door. 

Malloy rolled over on one el- 
bow. It was peculiar. They 
hadn’t done that for three 
years. 

Two of them came inside, 
thick men with disinterested 
faces. 

“Try no sudden moves,” one 
of them advised him. 

“We will anticipate you,” 
the other one added. 

Malloy went through the 
unfamiliar process of stand- 
ing up. He looked at two men. 
“I wouldn’t try anything 
against the four of you. I’m 
not that crazy.” 

“Time for an interrogation, 



66 








67 





Malloy,” the orderly said. 
“Come with us.” 

Malloy fell in between them 
and left the padded cell, 
frowning. 

“What kind of an interroga- 
tion ?” he asked them. 

“What other kind?” one 
countered. “A sanity hearing.” 
He felt his eyebrows jerk. 
His sanity? He thought that 
had been established long ago. 
Or his lack of it. 

M ALLOY remembered the 
doctor. He hadn’t had 
much else to do for several 
years. 

He was Dr. Heirson, a gray- 
ing man with starched face 
and collar. But the younger 
man sitting with Heirson be- 
hind the broad, translucent 
desk was a stranger to Malloy. 
He seemed to be a comic strip 
drawing, all in straight lines. 
“Yes, sir.” 

“Step forward, Michael,” 
Heirson said. 

Malloy stepped forward. It 
had been a long time since he 
had been allowed to travel so 
far. 

“Now relax, Michael,” the 
doctor continued, leaning for- 
ward and grinning hideously. 
“All you have to do is tell me 
the truth.” 

“No, I don’t, Doctor. I’m 
under no compulsion to tell 
you the truth. I’m perfectly 
capable of lying if it would 
do me any good.” 

“Hush that, Michael. You 
must not try to make believe 

68 



you can lie. I know you tell me 
only the truth.” 

“All right,” Malloy said, ex- 
haling deeply. “Believe that I 
speak only the truth if you 
like. But remember, I just told 
you that I’m a liar and that 
must be true.” 

Heirson blinked in watery 
confusion. He was obviously 
senile; only the old man’s 
Rider kept him from coming 
apart at his mental seams. 

The angle-faced man spoke 
into Heirson’s ear. The old 
doctor continued to blink for a 
moment, then faced Malloy, 
the lines of his face drawn 
into an asterisk. 

“What? You mean to tell 
me that you don’t have an in- 
ner voice that urges you to 
tell the truth at all times?” 
“No,” Malloy explained, "I 
do not hear voices.” 

“You don’t?” 

“Never.” 

“And there is no inner sense 
that tells you when somebody 
is plotting against you ?” 
“Absolutely not.” 

“And when you are in trou- 
ble or danger, there is nothing 
that allows you to somehow 
look into the future or read 
minds or see through walls?” 
“I can’t do any of those 
things,” Malloy stated. 

Heirson threw up his hands, j 
“Complete withdrawal from 
reality! Pathological! Why is, 
he here anyway?” 

The younger man grasped 1 
the withered thin upper arm 
and whispered audibly but 

JIM HARMON 




not understandably. Heirson’s 
face eventually quivered back 
in line with Malloy’s. 

“Michael, do you know 
what year this is?” the doctor 
asked. 

Malloy thought about that 
one. He wasn’t absolutely cer- 
tain, but he made some rapid 
calculations. 

“1978?” 

“1979! And what has been 
the single most important de- 
velopment in human history in 
recent times?” 

Malloy sighed. He knew 
what he was expected to say. 
“The coming of the Riders.” 
“And what are Riders?” 
“Riders,” Malloy recited pa- 
tiently, “are elements of a 
symbiotic life-form. They have 
united with human beings to 
make one symbiotic creature. 
They have given much more 
than, they have taken. All 
prominent religions recognize 
that they do not interfere with 
human free will. They have 
made us healthier, virtually 
immortal, and near supermen. 
The human race now is so 
much zoa, and every man is a 
zoon. Every man but me. 
Damn it, I don’t have any 
Rider! I’m not a superman and 
I cannot get away with pre- 
tending to be one!” 

Heirson oscillated his head. 
“Michael, Michael, your case 
isn’t unique. There are others 
who claim that they have no 
Riders — usually maintaining 
that they are naturally super- 
human and need no help from 

THE LAST TRESPASSER 



some funny kind of foreigner. 
They are tolerated the same 
way, that B.R., we tolerated 
people who claimed they pos- 
sessed psychic auras, or who 
got up in cathedrals and yelled 
that they had no souls. But 
you, Michael, are a trouble- 
maker. You’ve been rude, vul- 
gar, and reckless with your 
life and others in your pre- 
tense to be Riderless. Your 
pathological retreat from real- 
ity leaves us with no choice 
but to — ” 

The other man behind the 
desk shoved a paper in front 
of Heirson and tapped it 
forcefully with an index fin- 
ger. 

H EIRSON read the paper 
and his eyebrows went 
askew. “Yes, yes, we have dis- 
covered that there is a basic 
difference between you and the 
others who maintain they have 
no Riders. It would seem it has 
been established that you 
really do not have a Rider. Re- 
markable! Yes. Well, I have 
no alternative but to dismiss 
you from this institution, 
Michael Malloy, and to extend 
to you my personal apology 
for any inconvenience your 
three-and-a-half-years’ detain- 
ment may have caused you.” 

A trick, Malloy thought. 
Only what point would 
there be in tricking him? 

The oppressive horror of it 
crushed down upon him with 
its full weight. 

“Oh, no,” he said. “No, sir. 

69 




Take me back to my padded 
cell. I’ve got my rights. I’m 
not going out there again. 
Maybe I could have learned to 
live with it once, but not now. 
I can’t face up to living with a 
world of supermen, people 
who can do everything better 
than I can. Take me back. I 
think I’m going to get violent 
any minute now !” 

He took a swing at the near- 
est guard, but naturally the 
guard’s Rider told him what 
was coming and he dodged 
deftly, caught Malloy’s arm 
and twisted it into half-nelson 
to hold him completely, infu- 
riatingly helpless. Malloy had 
to hold back tears of frustra- 
tion. 

“Fortunately,” Dr. Heirson 
croaked, “you can do no harm 
even if you do get violent, and 
I’m sure everyone will want 
to do everything possible for a 
poor unfortunate like your- 
self. We all will make allow- 
ances.” 

“No, no, no!” Malloy an- 
nounced with the rhythm of 
his stomping feet. “I won’t 
leave here ! I won’t!” 

T HE man beside Heirson 
favored Malloy with a 
smile ; Malloy wasn’t sure 
whether it was friendly or 
mocking. The stranger nodded 
his head briefly to the guards. 

Malloy was dragged, pro- 
testing, down the marble- 
floored hallway to the entrance 
of the mental hospital. His 
anguished cries echoed across 

70 



the ornate ceiling of the old 
building. 

He was shoved out the front 
door with a parcel in brown 
paper under his arms. 

Malloy made one desperate 
attempt to get back inside but 
the massive door clanged in 
his face, and he could hear the 
reverberations dying away in- 
side and the steady retreat of 
footsteps. 

Malloy turned away in pain 
from the unaccustomed bril- 
liance and warmth of the sun 
and banged on the door with 
his fists and demanded to be 
readmitted. 

He grew hoarser and hoars- 
er and he slid further and 
further down until he was 
squatting on the threshold, his 
cheek rested against the warm 
varnished surface of the door. 

Malloy had never been an 
overly proud or vain man be- 
fore the Riders had come. 
After all, he’d had one of the 
most menial jobs on Earth ; he 
had been a magazine editor. 
But now he felt squashed un- 
der the thumb of humiliation. 

The monstrous indignity of 
it all ! 

To be thrown out of an asy- 
lum! 

After a time, Malloy felt a 
coolness, a wetness on his 
head. 

He dreamed a little dream to 
himself that he knew was a 
dream: they were coming to 
wrap him in warm sheets 
again. 

But it was only a dream. 

JIM HARMON 




This wetness wasn’t warm — it 
was chilly. He finally identi- 
fied it from his memories. This 
was rain. 

He stirred himself and gath- 
ered up the brown bundle that 
he knew must contain his suit, 
papers and a little money. 

Malloy trudged down the 
road toward the town that lay 
below the sanitarium, his col- 
lar turned up. 

He found he didn’t mind the 
rain so much. It tended to set- 
tle the dust, and the walk 
would be a long one. 

G rayson amery, the 

iron-haired publisher, 
greeted Malloy with a firm, 
warm, dry handshake. 

“Michael, it’s certainly good 
to see you again. You are look- 
ing well.” 

“Yes, the bruises left by 
the strait jacket straps don’t 
show,” said Malloy. 

“A unique miscarriage of 
justice,” Amery said. 

“I certainly hope it’s unique. 
I hope there aren’t any more 
poor devils like me locked 
away.” 

Amery offered Malloy a 
chair with a broad, well-man- 
icured hand. “I’m confident 
that there aren’t. And you are 
out now, fortunately.” 

“You can call it fortune if 
you like,” Malloy said uneas- 
ily. 

“But you ore glad to be 
out?” 

Malloy hesitated. “I’m re- 
signed to it. The flow of time 

THE LAST TRESPASSER 



washed some of the salt out of 
the wound. Being born is defi- 
nitely a traumatic experi- 
ence.” 

“How well I remember!” 
Amery said. 

Malloy glanced at him 
sharply, then eased back in his 
chair. Of course, like every- 
body else, thanks to his Rider, 
Amery had total recall. Malloy 
couldn’t even remember his 
first birthday party. 

“Is there any way I can be 
of help to you, Michael?” 
Amery went on. 

“Sure. I want my job back.” 

Amery’s forehead squeezed 
into lines of distress. “Yes, I 
was made aware of that. But, 
Michael, there have been a lot 
of changes in the publishing 
business since you were with 
us. For instance, it would be 
difficult for you to proofread a 
manuscript today.” 

“I’m hardly the type who 
can’t spell. I haven’t forgotten 
that.” 

“I know, Michael, but here 
— have a look at this.” 

Amery handed over a sheet 
of paper. 

Malloy glanced at it. It 
seemed a typical sheet of a 
writer’s manuscript, though a 
horrible yellowish gray that 
made the typescript from the 
tatters of a ribbon almost il- 
legible. It was also smudged 
with jelly-doughnut finger- 
prints and there were several 
holes burned in it by drop- 
pings of cigarette ash. Pretty 
sloppy, but things didn’t seem 

71 




to have changed much. Not 
until he read the paper. 

— /Cynthia / — / ( walked ) 
toward — /#((him ))#/ —

Hi,’” — /she / — # called 
(out) to ((him)). 

“ ’/Hello/’ ”, ‘Sweetstuff’, 
he / said /, ((trying)) to 
# sound # (flrat/) / ... 

Malloy looked up blankly. 
“What are all the cockeyed 
punctuation marks doing in 
there?” he asked. 

Amery exhaled Havana 
smoke expansively. “That’s 
the way things are now, Mi- 
chael. Those punctuation 
marks indicate whether the 
protagonist’s thoughts are 
self-directed or Rider-direct- 
ed, or a combination of both, 
and which is dominant at the 
time, human or Rider. They 
became absolutely essential 
with the coming of the Rid- 
ers.” 

Malloy covered his lips 
with his fingers. “Of course, 
I don’t understand this punc- 
tuation now. But I could 
learn it quickly enough.” 

The publisher shook his 
massive head. “No, you could- 
n’t learn it. You don’t have a 
Rider. You could never un- 
derstand all the little subtle- 
ties.” 

“I could fake it.” 

“Never. It might get past 
the average reader, but the 
author and critics would know 
right away. All an editor can 
do is watch for typographical 

72 



errors and change them Hie 
way the author wanted them 
if his fingers hadn’t tripped 
over the wrong keys. As it 
was, we used to get a good 
many complaints from writ- 
ers about you making 
changes in their work.” 
“Grammar,” Malloy ex- 
plained. “I got kind of a bug 
about grammar. I used to fix 
up manuscripts some.” 

R UBBING out his fat cigar, 
Amery leaned across his 
desk. “This isn’t like the 
good old days when I started 
out, Mike. If I had my way to- 
day, I’d get the National 
Guard ordered out and have 
those miserable slobs grind 
out stories with a bayonet at 
their backs!” The red gleam 
dimmed in Amery’s eyes. 
“Those were the days, by 
God ! Back then you didn’t 
edit manuscripts with any 
dinky little blue pencil — you 
used a razor blade and a 
grease stick!” 

Amery slumped down in his 
swivel, his eyes now only em- 
bers. “But that day is over, 
Mike. Writers have their 
rights, damn them. You get 
the wrong punctuation in one 
of their private-eye epics, 
Mike, and one of them will 
slap a suit against the com- 
pany for defacing a Work of 
Art, and both of us could 
land in jail.” 

“Westerns,” Malloy sug- 
gested in desperation. “His- 
torical fiction. They can’t 

JIM HARMON 




employ the new punctuation. I 
could edit them.” 

The vetern publisher shook 
his head again. “No. Cow- 
boys in westerns today turn 
your stomach more than ever 
with their damned nobility 
and purity. Heroines in his- 
torical novels act just as if 
deodorants and Living Bras 
had been in use back then. 
And these stories are written 
as if the characters did have 
Riders, with only a few minor 
concessions.” 

“Okay.” Malloy stood up. 
“I’ll go quietly.” 

“Maybe you’re lucky, 
Mike,” Amery said up at him. 
“I remember old-fashioned 
ideals like privacy and free 
will and free enterprise. They 
don’t exist any more. You 
can’t tell me that my free will 
hasn’t been affected. Why, 
every business deal I’ve had 
since the Coming has been 
strictly ethical. You know 
that isn’t like me!” 

“No,” Malloy admitted 
thoughtfully. 

“I’m even so ethical now 
that I recognize I owe you 
something. I know money 
can’t repay — ” 

“Hell it can’t,” Malloy said 
quickly. 

The publisher stripped off 
a sheaf of bills with delibera- 
tion. 

Malloy pocketed them. 
Enough to keep him eating 
for a couple of months. After 
that, there was always the 
Salvation Army. He didn’t 

THE LAST TRESPASSER 



have anything to worry 
about, really. 

“Amery, what would you 
do if you were in my place?” 
he heard himself ask sudden- 
ly. 

A MERY steepled his fin- 
gers. “I hesitate to sug- 
gest a deception to anyone, 
but since you ask me what I 
would do if I didn’t have a 
Rider, I will tell you the 
truth : I would pretend that I 
did not have a Rider.” 

“What are you talking 
about? I don’t have a Rider. 
So far as I myself personally 
know, I’m the only person in 
the whole damned world that 
doesn’t have one. I’d like to 
find out why, but I’m no sci- 
entist. So I just have to live 
with it. Or without it.” 
“There’s a very, very fine 
difference,” Amery pointed 
out with one finger. “Seman- 
tics is no longer a living sci- 
ence since the Coming, but I’ll 
try to make myself clear. You 
must pretend to have to pre- 
tend that you don’t have a 
Rider. Join the Jockey Set.” 
“Jockey Set,” Malloy mum- 
bled, massaging the back of 
his neck. “I've been put away 
for three and a half years. 
What’s the Jockey Set?” 
“Jockeys are characters 
who pretend that they don't 
have Riders, that they are 
self-sufficient human beings. 
Sometimes they use their 
Riders’ powers and claim to 
be natural supermen. Some- 

73 




times they leave Rider power 
untapped and pretend to be 
natural, old-type human be- 
ings. But they are all fakes. 
The Rider in them comes out 
sooner or later.” 

“But if they have Riders, 
will I be able to fool them into 
thinking I’m only pretending 
to be without one?” 

Amery lifted his shoulders 
and drew down the corners of 
his mouth. “Who knows? I 
will tell you this, though — 
you must be pretty much of a 
blank to a Rider. If they 
won’t touch you, it must 
mean they can’t.” 

Malloy started to ask him 
how he knew what Riders felt 
about him, then thought bet- 
ter of it. 

“How would I fake trying 
to hide the fact that I didn’t 
have a Rider? I suppose, may- 
be, by slipping up and letting 
myself predict the future or 
something . .” 

“That’s it!” Amery beam- 
ed. “You see? It will be easy !” 
“Of course,” Malloy said 
dully. 

“I mean, that is to say, any 
time you don’t do something 
and don’t do it particularly 
well, the Jockeys will only ad- 
mire your splendid act.” 
Malloy nodded thoughtful- 
ly. He turned and shook 
hands with the publisher. 
“Well, Amery, thanks for the 
money — and the advice. You 
always were the most devious 
master of deceit I ever 
knew.” 



“Thank you,” Amery said 
with great sincerity. 

“There’s one more thing. 
This may sound silly, but 
they found me out pretty 
quick after it happened. 
What does a Rider look like? 
Where do they come from? 
Where do they fasten onto the 
brain or body of human be- 
ings?” 

Amery leaned across the 
desk and backhanded Malloy 
in the mouth. 

“Get out!” Amery said. 

Malloy left the office, hold- 
ing a handkerchief to his cut 
lip. 

r * WAS a dump. The name 
had changed a half dozen 
times over the last half cen- 
tury, but the spots in 
the tablecloths remained the 
same. The dump had seen the 
Lost Generation, the Beat 
Generation, and now the Rid- 
den Generation. 

Only, Malloy supposed, 
they called themselves the 
Riderless Generation. Well, 
maybe they were. Maybe 
they were like him. 

He walked in, hanging onto 
that thought, his stride long. 
He cut down his stride. At 
that rate he would be out in 
the alley soon. 

Self-consciously, Malloy slid 
into a chair at a vacant table 
so he wouldn’t draw undue 
attention. 

As he began idly tracing 
the grease spots on the table- 
cloths that looked like the 



74 



JIM HARMON 




wrappers from a line of ce- 
real boxes, all red and white 
checks, he discovered every 
shaved head in the room was 
triangulating him. 

He shifted uncomfortably. 
He was playing it middle-of- 
the-road. He had a close crew- 
cut and wore a plaid flannel 
shirt and purple velvet ballet 
leotards. Maybe he was too 
far on the conservative side 
for here. 

“Spell it, saddle,” the 
counterman called to him 
without coming front. 

“Cola,” he ordered. "With 
chickory, pecans and honey.” 

“One sou’easter on the 
path,” the counterman called 
out tiredly. 

“With you’re going to sit 
there, He?” a liquid female 
voice flowed into his ear. 

“With I’m doing it, She,” 
Malloy said, not turning. 

She eased around in front 
of the table. She was red-hair- 
ed and built, wearing black 
leotards and a coat of black 
enamel. 

“Your pupils are going to 
wear me away,” the redhead 
said. 

“I’ve only got eyes. How 
else can I read you?” 

“That is Truth. Tru-u-th.” 

The counterman set out 
Malloy’s drink. “It’s waiting 
for you, saddle. Don’t tease 
it or it’ll bite.” 

He went for the cola and 
brought it to the table. 

“You came back?” she said. 

He pulled up his chair. “I 

THE LAST TRESPASSER 



always come back. You can 
risk money on it. Saddle up?” 
“Saddle before the post, my 
touchstone.” 

T HE girl sat down. Her 
green eyes were moving, 
always moving, but mostly 
over Malloy, his chair, the 
table. “You going to keep 
possession here long?” 

“I don’t know any reason 
why not,” said Malloy. 

“Of course you don’t!” she 
snapped. “Only — they close 
at five.” 

“The billboard gives it two 
dozen hours a day.” 

“They trim a little off at 
five. To sweep the floors and 
change the tableshrouds.” 
“Change ’em from one 
table to another,” Malloy 
jibed. 

“You formed it. Clean ones 
in front, dirty ones in the 
shadows. Let’s try breathing 
air,” she suggested. 

“Wait’ll we gate up. I’ve 
got pecans to drink.” 

The counterman’s hawking 
laugh filled the room. “Let 
him wait, Mandy. I might as 
well wait to later to sweep it 
in.” 

Her face caught fire for an 
instant. “The Board of 
Health don’t go away just be- 
cause you can read their dirty 
minds.” 

“So take him out,” the 
counterman snarled. 

Malloy suddenly decided he 
had played hard to get long 
enough. This was his first 

75 




chance to get in with the 
Jockeys. From what he had 
heard, they had some kind of 
underground set-up to help 
their own in business and the 
arts. He needed that help. 

“Let’s lope,” he said, push- 
ing his chair back and leaving 
silver on the table for the 
drink and a tip. 

He touched the girl’s lac- 
quered arm and steered her 
toward the door. 

Behind him, the floor fell in. 

Ripping, tearing, render- 
ing, splintering, crashing, 
crushing, reverberating bed- 
lam! 

Of course, it couldn’t have 
been the floor caving in, Mal- 
loy thought as he turned to 
see a great hole where the 
floor had disappeared. 

The hole was where the 
table and chair he had been 
using had stood a moment be- 
fore. 

Flapping at the sides of the 
cave-in were innumerable 
thicknesses of linoleum, and 
between each one an incredible 
accumulation of filth and 
debris — 0. Henry candy bar 
wrappers, a cover from a 
Collier’s, a booklet on the new 
Packard (“Ask the Man Who 
Owns One”), a newspaper 
article on Flo Ziegfield’s girls 
(stop thinking in slogans), 
but mostly just dirt— dust, 
webs, lint, filth. There had 
been no boards under the 
table ; the ends of the exposed 
boards weren’t freshly broken 
but old and rotted porously 

76 



smooth. Only the linoleum and 
the dirt had supported the 
table for years. 

Malloy edged closer and 
saw some broken sticks lying . 
on a jagged pile of coke stand- 
ing out black in the darkness 
far below. 

The redhead pulled him 
back from the edge, her fin- 
gers digging into his biceps, 
writhing with a strangle pas- 
sionate intensity, as if she 
were trying to knead him into 
a layer for a pie. 

“With . you’re a REAL 
Jockey, He, a REAL Jockey, 
a REAL ONE. Truth! I’m 
going to take you to the Com- 
missioner, He, the Commis- 
sioner in his saddle.” 

Somehow, uncertain, yet : 
surely, Malloy was dimly 
pleased at this. 

< <T\ON’T say it,” the fat 
-L7 m an remarked, glanc- 
ing up for an instant, then 
lowering his eyes to the splay 
of papers on his desk. “No 
esoteric jargon, please.” 

“All right,” Malloy said 
readily. “Shall I sit down?” 
“By all means, saddle up.” 
A second chin trembled. 
“Damn it, there I go. Have a 
chair.” 

Malloy took the only chair 
not piled down with books, or 
maps, or correspondence, or 
manuscripts, or notes. It had 
a straight back and a plastic 
seat, piously uncomfortable. 

The big man looked up a 
second time and folded rows 



JIM HARMON 




of pink sausages complacent- 
ly. “So you want to be a 
Jockey, eh?” 

Malloy thinned his lips and 
licked the insides of them, 
making a snap judgment. 
“Not really. I don’t have a 
Rider, and I want what help 
the Jockeys can give me. I’m 
not particularly anxious to 
acquire introverted slang and 
a shaved head, but if that 
goes along with the help . .” 
He spread his hands elo- 
quently. 

“So you don’t think you 
have a Rider?” 

Malloy didn’t know how to 
answer that. “I don’t think I 
have a Rider,” he repeated 
without inflection. 

“I don’t think I have a Rid- 
er, either — only I know I do,” 
the fat man said. 

Malloy stood up elaborately. 
“You dirty steed.” 

“Oh, sit down, Malloy, sit 
down. I’m a Jockey like the 
rest of you. There’s only one 
difference. I know I’m sick. 
I’ve got a Rider and all its 
powers, but I could no more 
use them than an acrophobe 
could climb a ladder up the 
Empire State to get at a nak- 
ed princess sitting on a bag 
of gold.” 

Malloy eased back down 
onto the chair and shook his 
head slowly. “That would be 
a hell of a way to be.” 

The big man slammed 
down two hams made out of 
fists. “You are exactly the 
same way, sonny boy! Only 

THE LAST TRESPASSER 



you don’t know any better.” 

Malloy swallowed. The man 
known as the Commissioner 
might be right at that. “Have 
it your way,” Malloy said. 
“But I sure think I don’t 
have a Rider.” 

The Commissioner smirked. 
Malloy knew what that meant. 
He knew men like the fat boy ; 
he understood them. He had 
had Grayson Amery, Dr. 
Heirson — he knew the breed. 

“What are you holding 
back on me?” Malloy demand- 
ed. 

“Malloy, do you even know 
what a Rider is?” 

Malloy paused. Then, "No, 
I don’t.” 

“I thought not. Shall I tell 
you?” 

“I imagine you were plan- 
ning to.” 

The Commissioner braced 
his fists on the work surface 
of the desk and lifted his 
bulk halfway from the chair. 
“The Riders are a disease. 
Like rabies.” 

Malloy cleared his throat. 
“That’s one way to look at 
them.” 

“Don’t be servilely civil to 
me. That is an accurate, clin- 
ical description of the Riders 
— they are a cerebral infec- 
tion.” 

“You mean their powers of 
emergency telepathy and pre- 
cognition, their seeming sec- 
ondary personality — all that’s 
a hallucination?” 

Malloy was fevered as he 
asked it. It was at last some 

77 




confirmation of his own 
theory. The whole world was 
sick, except him. 

“That is exactly what I 
don’t mean,” the Commis- 
sioner said contemptuously. 
“The Riders are real entities, 
capable of real miracles so far 
as we are concerned. But they 
aren’t mammals, or insects, or 
pure energy forms — they are 
viruses.” 

“Viruses that can think?” 
Malloy asked, aghast. 

“No. No one unit of the 
strain can think, but chains 
of them can. Together they 
form different combinations 
and responses, like analog 
components or brain synapses. 
Objectively, they are an in- 
fection that can enter the 
body anywhere but that al- 
ways spread to the prefrontal 
lobes — like rabies. Only they 
don’t destroy tissue; the Rid- 
ers are benign parasites.” 

“That’s one word for 
them,” Malloy admitted. “But 
if they are a virus, there must 
be antibodies — is that the 
word? — for them?” 

The fat man snorted un- 
pleasantly. “You can’t fight 
an infection that is smart 
enough to consciously change 
its shape and fight back. Nat- 
ural adaptation and mutation 
are tough enough. Besides, 
nobody would stand for being 
cured of his Rider, any more 
than you would let me ‘cure’ 
you of having eyes.” 

“Then what was your point 
in telling me the nature of the 

78 



Riders? You weren’t merely 
conducting an adult education 
class.” 

“True.” The Commissioner 
burped delicately and settled 
back in his chair. “As a mat- 
ter of fact, there is one thing 
I left out: the Riders aren’t 
suited for Earth. They have 
difficulty in adapting them- 
selves to live on this planet. 
Once they get into a human 
being, they are okay. But be- 
fore that they are weak and 
have to get hothouse care. Ex- 
actly that — hothouse care.” 
Malloy’s tongue stuck to the 
roof of his mouth. He pulled 
it loose and said, “And you 
can break the windows of hot- 
houses!” 

The Commissioner smiled. 
It was unpleasant to watch. 

“TVTOTHING personal, Mal- 
^ loy,” the Commissioner 
whispered almost subvocally 
as they lay together in the 
green ooze, “but we haven’t 
known you long enough to 
give you our trust. The first 
false step will be a long one 
for you — exactly six feet.” 
Malloy tried to squint 
through the foggy darkness, 
and almost instantly gave it 
up. “You can’t blame me for 
everything. Commissioner. I 
told you I wasn’t convinced 
that some of the Riders in 
there won’t precog our plans 
to save themselves.” 

“All the ones we are going 
to destroy are the unhooked- 
up ones. They can’t send any- 

JIM HARMON 




thing any more than one 
unattached telephone could. 
They aren’t really very good 
with their psi powers. It’s 
strictly an emergency talent, 
like our sudden spurts of 
adrenalin.” 

He gave an unsatisfied 
grunt and bellied forward. 

Up ahead of Malloy, the 
Commissioner and an unstable 
stable of Jockeys who had 
been coming into town for 
weeks lay the secret hatchery 
of unhosted Rider viruses. 
They could only multiply be- 
yond a certain self-maintain- 
ing balance inside the human 
body, and had to be grown in 
cultures on Earth, outside the 
healthy climate of a null- 
gravity, radiated vacuum in 
space. 

It was the Commissioner’s 
plan to destroy all the virus 
cultures, so that in eighteen 
years or so there would come 
along a Rider-free generation 
to outnumber the minor su- 
permen still infected by the 
Riders. 

Malloy had a lot of doubts 
about the plan, but he was 
willing to go along for his 
own reasons. 

During the past few weeks 
of indoctrination and com- 
mando training, Malloy had 
had time to think. It hadn’t 
taken nearly that long to fig- 
ure out the Commissioner. 

The Commissioner was 
simply a man who had to 
have power, and he couldn’t 
stand for a whole human race 



to be more powerful than he 
was, just because of a lack 
within himself. He was out to 
pull everybody down to his 
level, so he could stand out 
again and take over. 

Still, Malloy thought, I 
may have something to say 
about that. 

The men and a few women 
crawled through the semi- 
tropical Florida mud toward 
the low buildings glimmering 
in the light from the thin 
crescent of moon. 

Malloy elbowed a foot closer 
to the hothouse breeding fac- 
tory up to here in stinking 
muck. Any second now, he 
thought, somebody is going to 
roll over on a cottonmouth. 

“Ready with your cloths,” 
a man next to him relayed, 
first catching his attention and 
mostly lip-synching it. 

Malloy dug out his Asphix- 
ion pad, and readied the tab 
to pull off the plastic coating. 
Clamped over the guards' 
faces, the catalytic agent 
would rapidly absorb the 
men’s oxygen. With a partial 
vacuum in the mouth and lar- 
ynx, no cries could carry and 
the victim would rapidly black 
out. 

The pad would be removed 
and the guards would be al- 
lowed to catch up on their air 
intake. They wouldn’t be 
harmed in any way final, so 
their emergency psi warning 
system wasn’t supposed to cut 
in. 

Malloy shrugged. 



THE LAST TRESPASSER

The plan would never work. 

It was based on equal parts 
of megalomania and wishful 
thinking. 

Malloy’s only problem was 
when and how to best expose 
the plot before it was found 
out without his help. 

He couldn’t stand up and 
shout a warning. If he tried 
that, one of the fanatic Jock- 
eys was sure to clamp an As- 
phixion pad over his face, and, 
with him, they might not be 
considerate enough to remove 
it. 

Only a treacherous, self- 
seeking rat would even think 
of exposing these poor mis- 
guided people and betraying 
his own race to some extra- 
terrestrial viruses. 

Malloy’s elbows slipped out 
from under him and he went 
face first into the mud. 

He forced himself to keep 
from spluttering and lifted his 
head. Where had that idea 
come from ? 




finally acquired a Rider. 

But no. A Rider would hard- 
ly urge him to carry out an at- 
tack against the citadel of ex- 
istence to its own kind. It had 
to be something simpler, more 
elemental than that. 

The voice had been his own 
conscience crying out against 
treason. 

He followed the probable 
train of circumstances if he 
heeded his conscience. 



He would most probably be 
killed in this useless attack. 
He doubted that this was the 
only breeding chamber for 
Riders, or, that if it were, the 
Riders safely in human bodies 
couldn’t transplant part of 
themselves and start new cul- 
tures. 

If he wasn’t killed, he would 
probably be returned to his 
cell, his padded cell, by Rider- 
ridden people. 

If he were somehow let off, 
he would be left to wander the 
streets, a public ward. 

The trouble with his con- 
science was that it wasn’t logi- 
cal — and it had a poor mem- 
ory. 

It didn’t recall those three 
and a half years mislaid in 
an asylum. 

Only an unprincipled — 

Malloy shut it off and felt a 
drop of sweat running down 
the deep crevices between his 
eyebrows. My only problem, 
he reminded himself again and 
again, is how and when to ex- 
pose this raid before they dis- 
cover it without my help. 

The solution bloomed in his 
mind. 

It was remarkable how well 
the human mind could operate 
under stress. 

He half-rose from the mud 
so he would be silhouetted to 
anybody watching, and fell 
back. 

The guards hadn’t spotted 
him, but he heard the Jockeys 
scurrying toward him through 
the mud.

The squishing halted near 
him. 

He waited. 

The commandos moved 
ahead, leaving him behind. 

When he felt it was safe, 
Malloy took the Asphixion pad 
oif his face — a pad without 
the transparent plastic coat 
being pulled off. 

He made out a buddy team 
of Jockeys almost on top of the 
first Rider-ridden manned 
post. All the others had to be 
far ahead . 

Malloy leaped to his feet — 
or tried to. He managed to 
slosh to his knees. 

“Raid!” he screamed. “Jock- 
eys are raiding the hothouse!” 

The lights flared up, a mag- 
nesium, Fourth-of-July night 
glare. Guards with guns 
sprang from everywhere. The 
guns went into action. Clouds 
of crystalline Asphixion snow- 
ed down on the raiders. 

From far back, Malloy 
watched in satisfaction. 

The sound came from be- 
hind him. 

The Commissioner blobbed 
forward, a distorted ball of 
3limy mud. 

“I will crush you under my 
foot like a bloated white 
grub !” the fat man announced 
with sincerity. 

Malloy’s eyes narrowed in 
the darkness. 

“Stay away from me Com- 
missioner, or I’ll push you 
down — way, way down!” 

The blocky figure retreated 
a step, quivering impotently. 

THE LAST TRESPASSER 



Malloy nodded to himself. 
The Commissioner had spo- 
ken too knowingly of a terri- 
ble fear of falling. 

T HE interrogator was the 
younger man who sat next 
to Dr. Heirson during Malloy’s 
release from the hospital. 

“I feel you’d like to know 
my identity, Mr. Malloy. My 
name is Pearson; I work for 
the federal government. Now 
would you tell me just what 
you hoped to gain by betray- 
ing the assault force of Jock- 
eys?” 

It was the crux of the mat- 
ter. 

Malloy took a deep breath 
and said it. 

“I want a Rider. I want to 
be like everybody else. If you 
people have any sense of grati- 
tude and justice — and you 
seem to — you’ll set up some 
kind of scientific project to 
find out why I haven’t caught 
a case of Riders and to see 
that I am properly infected.” 
Pearson leaned back in the 
other straight chair inside the 
rough-boarded outbuilding. 

“Mr. Malloy, we know why 
none of the Riders who drifted 
in from outer space infected 
you. You already had a Rider 
— an entirely human, not 
alien, one. You are schizoid — 
you have a split personality. 
You adjusted to it to an in- 
credible degree and submerged 
it, but it was still there and 
no alien would touch a man 
who already had two minds.” 

81 




Malloy felt no emotion, only 
an inescapable acceptance. 
“My conscience,” he said. 

Pearson nodded. “Your sec- 
ond personality is becoming 
steadily less recessive.” 

“But telepathy — all the 

tricks of the Riders — I can’t 
do them.” 

“You will be able to. Two 
minds are better than one. It 
would seem that schizophrenia 
is the natural state of super- 
men, when properly trained 
and integrated. In fact, you 
should be able to accomplish 
more than a Rider-ridden man 
— you will have two human 
personalities, and the Riders 
are little more than viruses 
conscious of their own exist- 
ence.” 

“You mean I’m a super- 
man?” 

“Yes. But unfortunately 
you are a threat to the present 
order because of your non- 
Rider attitude. You are being 
returned to your padded cell. 
There are guards outside. I 
hope you will walk out quietly 
to meet them.” 

Malloy walked out quietly to 
meet the guards who would 
take him away. On his way 
out, he met Grayson Amery 
coming in. 

Pearson shook hands warm- 
ly with the publisher. 

“Mr. Amery, the govern- 
ment owes you a vote of 



thanks for recommending Mal- 
loy for this job of infiltrating 
the Jocks. Turning against 
one of your own kind is never 
easy ...” 

Amery laughed lightly. 
“Malloy was not ‘one of my 
kind.’ He was an editor. Even 
worse than that, I think in his 
attitude he always remained 
no more than a writer. I un- 
derstand he is being returned 
to confinement?” 

Pearson looked troubled. 
“Yes, sir. Personally, I would 
feel more comfortable if he 
were eliminated. I am not at 
all sure that we can keep Mal- 
loy under lock and key once he 
develops his potential of 
schizophrenia.” 

“I know. Unhappily, the 
primitive ethics of the Riders 
prevent our taking care of 
Mike in the most efficient way. 
That’s what I wanted to talk 
to you about. May I sit down?” 
“Please do, sir,” said Pear- 
son. 

Amery took the vacant 
chair and leaned forward with 
boyish enthusiasm. 

“Mr. Pearson, I have faith 
in humanity. I believe we can 
keep the benefits of any situa- 
tion, including the Riders, and 
eliminate the disadvantages 
and limitations. My boy, all of 
us must start to work to find a 
way to override the Riders!”

D UNLOP was short and 
pudgy ; his eyelashes were 
blond and his hair was gone. 
He looked like the sort of man 
you see sitting way off at the 
end of the stadium at the Big 
Game, clutching a hot dog and 
a pennant and sitting with his 
wife. Who would be making 
him explain every play. Also

The girl at the reception 
desk of LaFitte Enterprises 
was a blue-eyed former model. 
She had Dunlop catalogued. 
She looked up slowly. She said 
bleakly: “Yes?” 

“I want to see Mr. LaF-F- 
F — ” said Dunlop, and paused 
to clear his throat. “I want to 
see Mr. La Fitte.” 

The ex-model was startled 
enough to blink. Nobody saw 
Mr. LaFitte! Oh, John D. the 
Sixth might. Or President 
Brockenheimer might drop by, 
after phoning first. Nobody 
else. Mr. LaFitte was a very 
great man who had invented 
most of America’s finest gadg- 
ets, and sold them for some of 
America’s finest money, and 
he was not available to casual 
callers. Particularly nobodies 
with suits that had come right 
off a rack. 

The ex-model was, however, 
a girl with a sympathetic 
heart — as was known only to 
her mother, her employer and 
the fourteen men who, one 
after another, had broken it. 
She was sorry for Dunlop. She 
decided to let the poor jerk 
down easy and said: “Who 
shall I say is calling, sir? Mr. 
Dunlop? Is that with an ‘O,’ 
sir? One moment.” And she 
picked up the phone, trying 
not to smile. 

The reception room was 
carpeted in real Oriental wool 
— none of your flimsy nylon or 
even LaFitton ! — and all about 
it were the symbols of La- 
Fitte’s power and genius. In a 

86 



nook, floodlighted, stood an 
acrylic model of the LaFitte 
Solar Transformer, transpar- 
ently gleaming. On a scarlet 
pedestal in the center of the 
room was the LaFitte Ion-Ex- 
change Self-Powered Water 
Still, in the small or forty-gal- 
lon-a-second model. (Two of 
the larger size provided all of 
London with sparkling clear 
water from the muddy, silty, 
smelly Thames.) 

Dunlop said hoarsely : “Hold 
it a second. Tell him that he 
won’t know my name, but we 
have a mutual friend.” 

The ex-model hesitated, 
struggling with a new fact. 
That changed things. Even 
Mr. LaFitte might have a 
friend who might by chance be 
acquainted with a little blond 
nobody whose shoes needed 
shining. It wasn’t likely, but 
it was a possibility. Especial- 
ly when you consider that Mr. 
LaFitte himself sprang from 
quite humble origins: at one 
time he had taught at a uni- 
versity. 

“Yes, sir,” she said, much 
more warmly. “May I have 
the friend’s name?” 

“I d-don’t know his name.” 

“Oh!” 

“But Mr. LaFitte will know 
who I m-mean. Just say the 
friend is a M — is a M — is a 
M-Martian.” 

The soft blue eyes turned 
bleak. The smooth, pure face 
shriveled into the hard Vogue 
lines that it had possessed be- 
fore an unbearable interest in

chocolate nougats had taken 
her from before the fashion 
cameras and put her behind 
this desk. 

“Get out!” she said. “That 
isn’t a bit funny !” 

The chubby little man said 
cheerfully: “Don’t forget the 
name, Dunlop. And I’m at 449 
West 19th Street. It’s a room- 
ing house.” And he left. She 
wouldn’t give anyone the mes- 
sage, he knew, but he knew 
comfortably that it didn’t mat- 
ter. He’d seen the little gold- 
plated microphone at the 
comer of her desk. The La- 
Fitte Auto-Sec it was hooked 
up to would unfailingly re- 
member, analyze and pass 
along every word. 

“Ho-hum,” said Dunlop to 
the elevator operator, “they 
make you fellows work too 
hard in this kind of weather. 
I’ll see that they put in air- 
conditioning.” 

The operator looked at Dun- 
lop as though he was some 
kind of a creep, but Dunlop 
didn’t mind. Why should he? 
He was a creep. But he would 
soon be a very rich one. 

H ector dunlop trotted 

out into the heat of Fifth 
Avenue, wheezing because of 
his asthma. But he was quite 
pleased with himself. 

He paused at the comer to 
turn and look up at the La- 
Fitte Building, all copper and 
glass bands in the quaint pe- 
riod architecture that LaFitte 
liked. Let him enjoy it, 

THE MARTIAN IN THE ATTIC 



thought Dunlop generously. It 
looks awful, but let LaFitte 
have his pleasures ; it was only 
fair that LaFitte have the 
kind of building he wanted. 
Dunlop’s own taste went to 
more modem lines, but there 
would be nothing to stop him 
from putting up a hundred- 
and-fifty-iwo-story building 
across the street if he liked. 
LaFitte was entitled to every- 
thing he wanted — as long as 
he was willing to share with 
Hector Dunlop. As he certain- 
ly would be, and probably that 
very day. 

Musing cheerfully about the 
inevitable generosity of La- 
Fitte, Dunlop dawdled down 
Fifth Avenue in the fierce but 
unfelt heat. He had plenty of 
time. It would take a little 
while for anything to happen. 

Of course, he thought pa- 
tiently, it was possible that 
nothing would happen at all 
today. Whatever human the 
Auto-Sec reported to might 
forget. Anything might go 
wrong. But still he had time. 
All he had to do was try again, 
and try still more after that if 
necessary. Sooner or later the 
magic words would reach La- 
Fitte. After eight years of get- 
ting ready for this moment it 
didn’t much matter if it took 
an extra day or two. 

Dunlop caught his breath. 

A girl in needle-pointed 
heels came clicking by, the hot 
breeze plastering her skirt 
against her legs. She glanced 
casually at the volume of space 

87 




which Hector Dunlop thought 
he was occupying and found it 
empty. Dunlop snarled out of 
habit; she was not the only 
hormone-pumping girl who 
had seen nothing where he 
stood. But he regained his 
calm. To hell with you, my 
dear, he said good-humoredly 
to himself. I will have you 
later if I like. I will have 
twenty like you, or twenty a 
day if I wish. Starting very 
soon. 

He sprinted across Forty- 
second Street, and there was 
the gray familiar old-fashion- 
ed bulk of the Library. 

On a sentimental impulse he 
climbed the steps and went in- 
side. 

The elevator operator nod- 
ded. “Good afternoon, Mr. 
Dunlop. Three?” 

“That’s right, Charley. As 
usual.” They all liked him 
here. It was the only place in 
the world where that was true, 
he realized, but then he had 
spent more time here than 
anywhere else in the world. 

Dunlop got out of the slow 
elevator as it creaked to an 
approximate halt on the third 
floor. He walked reminiscent- 
ly down the wide, warm hall 
between the rows of exhibits. 
Just beyond the drinking 
fountain there. That was the 
door to the Fortescue Collec- 
tion. Flanking it were the 
glass cabinets that housed 
some of Fortescue’s own Mar- 
tian photographs, along with 
the unexplained relics of a 

88 



previous race that had built 
the canals. 

D UNLOP looked at the 
prints and could hardly 
keep from giggling. The 
Martians were seedy, slime- 
skinned creatures with snaky 
arms and no heads at all. 
Worse, according to Updyke’s 
The Martian Adventure, For- 
tescue’s own First to Land 
and Wilbert, Shevelsen and 
Buchbinder’s Survey of In- 
digenous Martian Semi-Fauna 
(in the Proceedings of the 
Astro-Biological Institute for 
Winter, 2011), they smelled 
like rotting fish. Their mean 
intelligence was given by 
Fortescue, Burlutski and 
Stanko as roughly equivalent 
to the Felidae (though Gaff- 
ney placed it higher, say about 
that of the lower primates). 
They possessed no language. 
They did not have the use of 
fire. Their most advanced 
tool was a hand-axe. In short, 
the Martians were the dopes 
of the Solar System, and it 
was not surprising that La- 
Fitte’s receptionist had view- 
ed describing a Martian as 
her employer’s friend as a 
gross insult. 

“Why, it’s Mr. Dunlop,” 
called the librarian, peering 
out through the wire grating 
on the door. She got up and 
came toward him to unlock 
the door to the Fortescue Col- 
lection. 

“No, thanks,” he said has- 
tily. “I'm not coming in 



FREDERtK POHL 




today. Miss Reidy. Warm 
weather, isn’t it? Well, I must 
be getting along.” 

When hell freezes over I’ll 
come in, he added to himself 
as he turned away, although 
Miss Reidy had been extreme- 
ly helpful to him for eight 
years ; she had turned the 
Library’s archives over to 
him, not only in the extrater- 
restrial collections but wher- 
ever his researching nose led 
him. Without her, he would 
have found it'much more diffi- 
cult to establish what he now 
knew about LaFitte. On the 
other hand, she wore glasses. 
Her skin was sallow. One of 
her front teeth was chipped. 
Dunlop would see only TV 
stars and the society debu- 
tantes, he vowed solemnly, 
and decided that even those 
he would treat like dirt. 

The Library was pressing 
down on him ; it was too much 
a reminder of the eight grub- 
like years that were now 
past. He left it and took a bus 
home. 

Less than two hours had 
elapsed since leaving La- 
Fitte’s office. 

That wasn’t enough. Not 
even the great LaFitte’s or- 
ganization would have been 
quite sure to deliver and act 
on the message yet, and Dun- 
lop was suddenly wildly anx- 
ious to spend no time waiting 
in his rooming house. He 
stopped in front of a cheap 
restaurant, paused, smiled 
broadly and walked across 

THE MARTIAN IN THE ATTIC 



the street to a small, cozy, ex- 
pensive place with potted 
palms in the window. It 
would just about clean out 
what cash he had left, but 
what of it? 

Dunlop ate the best lunch 
he had had in ten years, tak- 
ing his time. When some fum- 
bling chemical message told 
him that enough minutes had 
elapsed and he walked down 
the block to his rooming 
house, the men were there. 

The landlady peered out of 
her window from behind a 
curtain, looking frightened. 

Dunlop laughed out loud 
and waved to her as they 
closed in. They were two tall 
men with featureless faces. 
The heavier one smelled of 
chlorophyll chewing gum. The 
leaner one smelled of death. 

Dunlop linked arms with 
them, grinning broadly, and 
turned his back on his land- 
lady. “What did you tell her 
you w-were, boys? Internal 
Revenue? The F.B.I.?” They 
didn’t answer, but it didn’t 
matter. Let her think what 
she liked; he would never, 
never, never see her again. 
She was welcome to the few 
pitiful possessions in his 
cheap suitcase. Very soon now 
Hector Dunlop would have 
only the best. 

don’t know your 

1 boss’s secret, eh?” Dun- 
lop prodded the men during 
the car ride. “But I do. It 
took me eight years to find it 

89 




out. Treat me with a little re- 
spect or I m-might have you 
fired.” 

“Shut up,” said chloro- 
phyll-breath pleasantly, and 
Dunlop politely obeyed. It 
didn’t matter, like everything 
else that happened now. In a 
short time he would see La- 
Fitte and then — 

“Don’t p-p-push!” he said 
irritably, staggering before 
them out of the car. 

They caught him, one at 
each elbow, Chlorophyll open- 
ing the iron gate at the end 
of the walk and Death push- 
ing him through. Dunlop’s 
glasses came off one ear and 
he grabbed for them. 

They were well out of the 
city, having crossed the Hud- 
son. Dunlop had only the 
haziest sense of geography, 
having devoted all his last 
eight years to more profitable 
pursuits, but he guessed they 
were somewhere in the hills 
back of Kingston. They went 
into a great stone house and 
saw no one. It was a Frank- 
enstein house, but it cheered 
Dunlop greatly, for it was 
just the sort of house he had 
imagined LaFitte would need 
to keep his secret. 

They shoved Dunlop 
through a door into a room 
with a fireplace. In a leather 
chair before a fire (though 
the day was hot) was a man 
who had to be Quincy La- 
Fitte. 

“Hello,” said Dunlop with 
poise, strutting toward him. 

90 



“I suppose y-you know why 
I — Hey! What are you d-do- 
ing?” 

Chlorophyll was putting 
one gray glove on one hand. 
He walked to a desk, opened 
it, took out something — a 
gun! In his gloved hand he 
raised it and fired at the wall. 
Splat. It was a small flat 
sound, but a great chip of 
plaster flew. 

“Hey!” said Dunlop again. 

Mr. LaFitte watched him 
with polite interest. Chloro- 
phyll walked briskly toward 
him, and abruptly Death 
reached for — for — 

Chlorophyll handed Dun- 
lop the gun he had fired. 
Dunlop instinctively grasped 
it, while Death took out an- 
other, larger, more danger- 
ous-looking one. 

Dunlop abruptly jumped, 
dropped the gun, beginning 
to understand. “Wait!” he 
cried in sudden panic. “I’ve 
g-g — ” He swallowed and 
dropped to his knees. “Don’t 
shoot! I’ve g-got everything 
written d-down in my luh — in 
my luh — ” 

LaFitte said softly : “Just a 
moment, boys.” 

Chlorophyll just stopped 
where he was and waited. 
Death held his gun competent- 
ly on Dunlop and waited. 

Dunlop managed to stam- 
mer: “In my lawyer’s office. 
I’ve got the whole th-thing 
written down. If anything 
happens to me he ruh — he 
ruh — he reads it.” 



FREDERIK POHt 




LaFitte sighed. “Well,” he 
said mildly, “that was the 
chance we took. All right, 
boys. Leave us alone.” Chloro- 
phyll and Death took their 
scent and their menace out 
the door. 

Dunlop was breathing very 
hard. He had just come very 
close to dying, he realized; 
one man handed him the gun, 
and the other was about to 
shoot him dead. Then they 
would call the police to deliv- 
er the body of an unsuccess- 
ful assassin. Too bad, officer, 
but he certainly fooled us! 
Look, there’s where the bullet 
went. I only tried to wing the 
poor nut, but — A shrug. 

Dunlop swallowed. “Too 
bad,” he said in a cracked 
voice. “But naturally I had to 
take p-precautions. Say. Can 
I have a drink?” 

Mr. LaFitte pointed to a 
tray. He had all the time there 
was. He merely waited, with 
patience and very little con- 
cern. He was a tall old man 
with a very bald head, but he 
moved quickly when he want- 
ed to, Dunlop noticed. Funny, 
he hadn’t expected LaFitte to 
be bald. 

But everything else was 
going strictly according to 
plan! 

H E POURED himself a 
stiff shot of twelve-year- 
old bourbon and downed it 
from a glass that was Steu- 
ben’s best hand-etched crys- 
tal. 

THE MARTIAN IN THE ATTIC 



He said : “I’ve got you, La- 
Fitte! You know it, don’t 
you?” 

LaFitte gave him a warm, 
forgiving look. 

“Oh, that’s the boy,” Dun- 
lop enthused. “B-Be a good 
loser. But you know I’ve 
found out what your fortune 
is based on.” He swallowed 
another quick one and felt the 
hot burning tingle spread. 
“Well. To b-begin with, eight 
years ago I was an undergrad 
at the university you taught 
at. I came across a reference 
to a thesis called Certain Ob- 
servations on the Ontogenesis 
of the Martian P-Parapri- 
mates. By somebody named 
Quincy A. W. L-LaFitte, 
B.S.” 

LaFitte nodded faintly, still 
smiling. His eyes were tricky, 
Dunlop decided ; they were 
the eyes of a man who had 
grown quite accustomed to 
success. You couldn’t read 
much into eyes like those. 
You had to watch yourself. 

Still, he reassured himself, 
he had all the cards. “So I 
1-looked for the paper and 
I couldn’t f-find it. But I guess 
you know that!” Couldn’t find 
it? No, not in the stacks, not 
in the Dean’s file, not even in 
the archives. It was very for- 
tunate that Dunlop was a 
persistent man. He had found 
the printer who had done the 
thesis in the first place, and 
there it was, still attached to 
the old dusty bill. 

“I remember the w-words,” 

91 




Dunlop said, and quoted from 
the conclusion. He didn’t stut- 
ter at all: 

“ ‘It is therefore to be 
inferred that the Martian 
paraprimates at one time 
possessed a mature culture 
comparable to the most so- 
phisticated milieux of our own 
planet. The artifacts and 
structural remains were not 
created by another race. Per- 
haps there is a correlation 
with the so-called Shtern- 
weiser Anomaly, when con- 
jecturally an explosion of 
planetary proportions deplet- 
ed the Martian water sup- 
ply.’ ” 

LaFitte interrupted : 
“Shternweiser ! You know, I 
had forgotten his name. It’s 
been a long time. But Shtern- 
weiser’s paper suggested that 
Mars might have lost its 
water in our own historical 
times — and then the rest was 
easy!’’ 

Dunlop finished his quota- 
tion : 

“ ‘In conjunction, these 
factors inescapably suggest a 
pattern. The Martian para- 
primates require an aqueous 
phase for development from 
grub to imago, as in many 
terrestrial invertebrates. Yet 
there has not been sufficient 
free water on the surface of 
Mars since the time of 
the Shternweiser explosion 
theory. It seems likely, there- 
fore, that the present exam- 
ples surviving are mere sexed 
grubs, and that the adult 

92 



Martian paraprimate does 
not exist in vivo, though its 
historical existence is attest- 
ed by the remarkable exam- 
ples left of their work.’ ” 
“And then,” finished Dun- 
lop, “you b-began to realize 
what you had here. And you 
d-destroyed all the copies. All, 
th-that is, b-but one.” 

I T WAS working ! It was all 
working the way it should ! 
LaFitte would have thrown 
him out long ago, of course, 
if he had dared. He didn’t 
dare. He knew that Dunlop 
had followed the long, crook- 
ed trail of evidence to its end. 

Every invention that bore 
the name LaFitte had come 
from a Martian mind. 

The fact that the paper was 
suppressed was the first clue. 
Why suppress it? The name 
attached to the paper was the 
second — though it had taken 
an effort of the imagination 
to connect a puny B.S. with 
the head of LaFitte Enter- 
prises. 

And all the other clues had 
come painfully and laborious- 
ly along the trail that led past 
Miss Reidy’s room at the Li- 
brary, the Space Exploration 
wing of the Smithsonian, the 
Hall of Extraterrestrial Zoo- 
forms at the Museum of Nat- 
ural History, and a thousand 
dusty chambers of learning all 
over the country. 

LaFitte sighed. “And so 
you know it all, Mr. Dunlop. 
You’ve come a long way.” 

FREDERIK POHL 




He poured himself a gen- 
tlemanly film of brandy in a 
large inhaler and warmed it 
with his breath. He said medi- 
tatively: “You did a lot of 
work, but, of course, I did 
more. I had to go to Mars, for 
one thing.” 

“The S-Solar Argosy,” Dun- 
lop supplied promptly. 

LaFitte raised his eye- 
brows. " That thorough? I 
suppose you realize, then, that 
the crash of the Solar Argosy 
was not an accident. I had to 
cover up the fact that I was 
bringing a young Martian 
back to Earth. It wasn’t easy. 
And even so, once I had him 
here, that was only half the 
battle. It is quite difficult to 
raise an exogenous life-form 
on Earth.” 

He sipped a drop of the 
brandy and leaned forward 
earnestly. “I had to let a Mar- 
tian develop. It meant giving 
him an aqueous environment, 
as close as I could manage to 
what must have been the con- 
ditions on Mars before the 
Shternweiser event. All guess- 
work, Mr. Dunlop! I can only 
say that luck was with me. 
And even then — why, think of 
yourself as a baby. Suppose 
your mother had abandoned 
you, kicking and wetting your 
diaper, on Jupiter. And sup- 
pose that some curious-shaped 
creature that resembled Mom- 
my about as much as your 
mother resembled a tree then 
took over your raising.” 

He shook his head solemnly. 

THE MARTIAN IN THE ATTIC 



“Spock was no help at all. The 
problem of discipline ! The toi- 
let training! And then I had 
nothing but a naked mind, so 
to speak. The Martian adult 
mind is great, but it needs to 
be filled with knowledge be- 
fore it can create, and that, 
Mr. Dunlop, in itself took me 
six difficult years.” 

He stood up. “Well,” he said, 
“suppose you tell me what you 
want.” 

Dunlop, caught off base, 
stammered terribly: “I w-w- 
want half of the tuh — of the 
tuh — ” 

“You want half of the 
take?” 

“That’s ruh— that’s— ” 

“I understand. In order to 
keep my secret, you want me 
to give you half of everything 
I earn from my Martian’s in- 
ventions. And if I don’t 
agree?” 

Dunlop said, suddenly pan- 
icked: “But you must! If I 
t-t-tell your secret, anyone can 
do the same !” 

LaFitte said reasonably: 
“But I already have my 
money, Mr. Dunlop. No, that’s 
not enough of an inducement 
. But,” he said after a mo- 
ment, “I doubt that such a con- 
sideration will persuade you to 
keep still. And, in fact, I do 
want this matter kept confi- 
dential. After all, six men died 
in the crash of the Solar Ar- 
gosy, and on that sort of thing 
there is no statute of limita- 
tions.” 

He politely touched Dun- 

93 




lop’s arm. “Come along. You 
deduced there was a Martian 
in this house? Let me show 
you how right you were.” 

A LL the way down a long 
carpeted corridor, Dunlop 
kept hearing little clicks and 
rustles that seemed to come 
from the wall. “Are those your 
b-bodyguards, LaFitte? Don't 
try any tricks !” 

LaFitte shrugged. “Come on 
out, boys,” he said without 
raising his voice; and a few 
feet ahead of them a panel 
opened and Death and Chloro- 
phyll stepped through. 

“Sorry about that other 
business, Mr. Dunlop,” said 
Chlorophyll. 

“No hard f-feelings,” said 
Dunlop. 

LaFitte stopped before a 
door with double locks. He 
spun the tumblers and the 
door opened into a dark, dank 
room. 

“V-r-r-roooom, v-r-r-room.” 
It sounded like a huge deep 
rumble from inside the room. 

Dunlop’s pupils slowly ex- 
panded to admit more light, 
and he began to recognize 
shapes. 

In the room was a sort of 
palisade of steel bars. Behind 
them, chained to a stake, 
was — 

A Martian! 

Chained? 

Yes, it was chained and 
cuffed. What could only be the 
key hung where the Martian 
would be able to see it always 

94 



but reach it never. Dunlop 
swallowed, staring. The Mar- 
tians in Fortescue’s photo- 
graphs were slimy, ropy, ugly 
creatures like thinned-out sea 
anemones, man-tall and head- 
less. The chained creature that 
thundered at him now was like 
those Martians only as a frog 
is like a tadpole. It possessed 
a head, round-domed, with 
staring eyes. It possessed a 
mouth that clacked open and 
shut on great square teeth. 

“V-r-r-room,” it roared, and 
then Dunlop listened more 
closely. It was not a wordless 
lion’s bellow. It was English! 
The creature was talking to 
them ; it was only the Earth’s 
thick atmosphere that made it 
boom. “Who are you?” it 
croaked in a slobbery-drunk 
Chaliapin’s boom. 

Dunlop said faintly: “God 
b-bless.” Inside that hideous 
skull was the brain that had 
created for LaFitte the Solar 
Transformer, the Ion-Ex- 
change Self-Powered Water 
Still, the LaFitte Negative- 
Impedance Transducer, and a 
thousand other great inven- 
tions. It was not a Martian 
Dunlop was looking at ; it was 
a magic lamp that would bring 
him endless fortune. But it 
was an ugly nightmare. 

“So,” said LaFitte. “And 
what do you think now, Mr. 
Dunlop ? Don’t you think I did 
something great? Perhaps the 
Still and the Transducer were 
his invention, not mine. But I 
invented him." 



FREDERIK POHL 




Dunlop pulled himself to- 
gether. “Y-yes,” he said, bob- 
bing his head. He had a con- 
cept of LaFitte as a sort of 
storybook blackmail victim, 
who needed only a leer, a whis- 
per and the Papers to start 
disgorging billions. It had not 
occurred to him that LaFitte 
would take honest pride in 
what he had done. Now, know- 
ing it, Dunlop saw or thought 
he saw a better tactic. 

He said instantly: “Great? 
N-No, LaFitte, it’s more than 
that. I am simply amazed that 
you brought him up without, 
say, r-rickets. Or juvenile de- 
linquency. Or whatever Mar- 
tians might get, lacking prop- 
er care.” 

LaFitte looked pleased. 
“Well, let’s get down to busi- 
ness. You want to become an 
equal partner in LaFitte En- 
terprises, is that what you’re 
asking for?” 

Dunlop shrugged. He didn’t 
have to answer. That was for- 
tunate ; in a situation as tense 
as this one, he couldn’t have 
spoken at all. 

LaFitte said cheerfully : 
“Why not? Who needs all this? 
Besides, some new blood in the 
firm might perk things up.” 
He gazed benevolently at the 
Martian, who quailed. “Our 
friend here has been lethargic 
lately. All right, I’ll make you 
work for it, but you can have 
half.” 

“Th— Th— Thank—” 

“You’re welcome, Dunlop. 
How shall we do it? I don’t 



suppose you’d care to take my 
word — ” 

Dunlop smiled. 

L AFITTE was not offended. 

“Very well, we’ll put it in 
writing. I’ll have my attorneys 
draw something up. I suppose 
you have a lawyer for them to 
get in touch with?” He snap- 
ped his fingers. Death stepped 
brightly forward with a silver 
pencil and Chlorophyll with a 
pad. 

“G-G-Good,” said Dunlop, 
terribly eager. “My 1-lawyer is 
P. George Metzger, and he’s in 
the Empire State Building, 
forty-first fl — ” 

“Fool!” roared the Martian 
with terrible glee. LaFitte 
wrote quickly and folded the 
paper into a neat square. He 
handed it to the man who 
smelled of chlorophyll chewing 
gum. 

Dunlop said desperately : 
"That’s not the s-same law- 
yer.” 

LaFitte waited politely. 
“Not what lawyer?” 

“My other lawyer is the one 
that has the p-p-papers.” 
LaFitte shook his head and 
smiled. 

Dunlop sobbed. He couldn’t 
help it. Before his eyes a bil- 
lion dollars had vanished, and 
the premium on his life-in- 
surance policy had run out. 
They had Metzger’s name. 
They knew where to find the 
fat manila envelope that con- 
tained the sum of eight years’ 
work. 



THE MARTIAN IN THE ATTIC 



95 




Chlorophyll, or Death, or 
any of LaFitte’s hundreds of 
confidential helpers, would go 
to Metzger’s office, and per- 
haps they would present 
phony court orders or perhaps 
they would bull their way 
through, a handkerchief over 
the face and a gun in the hand. 
One way or another they 
would find the papers. The 
sort of organization that La- 
Fitte owned would surely not 
be baffled by the office safe of 
a recent ex-law clerk, now in 
his first practice. 

Dunlop sobbed again, wish- 
ing he had not economized on 
lawyers; but it really made 
no difference. LaFitte knew 
where the papers were kept 
and he would get them. It re- 
mained only for him to erase 
the last copy of the informa- 
tion — that is, the copy in the 
head of Hector Dunlop. 

Chlorophyll tucked the note 
in his pocket and left. Death 
patted the bulge under his arm 
and looked at LaFitte. 

“Not here,” said LaFitte. 

Dunlop took a deep breath. 

“G-Good-bye, Martian,” he 
said sadly, and turned toward 
the door. Behind him the thick, 
hateful voice laughed. 

“You’re taking this very 
well,” LaFitte said in sur- 
prise. 

Dunlop shrugged and step- 
ped aside to let LaFitte pre- 
cede him through the doorway. 

“What else can I d-do?” he 
said. “You have me cold. 
Only — ” The Death man was 

96 



mrough the door, and so was 
LaFitte, half-turned politely 
to listen to Dunlop. Dunlop 
caught the edge of the door, 
hesitated, smiled and leaped 
back, slamming it. He found a 
lock and turned it. “Only you 
have to c-catch me first!” he 
yelled through the door. 

Behind him the Martian 
laughed like a wounded whale. 

“You were very good,” com- 
plimented the thick, tolling 
voice. 

“It was a matter of s-simple 
s-self -defense,” said Dunlop. 

H E COULD hear noises in 
the corridor, but there 
was time. “N-Now! Come, 
Martian ! We’re going to get 
away from LaFitte. You’re 
coming w-with me, because he 
won’t dare shoot you and — 
And certainly you, with your 
great mind, can find a way for 
us both to escape.” 

The Martian said in a thick 
sulky voice : “I’ve tried.” 

“But I can help ! Isn’t that 
thek-k-key?” 

He clawed the bright bit of 
metal off the wall. There was 
a lock on the door of steel bars, 
but the key opened it. The 
Martian was just inside, ropy 
arms waving. 

“V-r-r-room,” it rumbled, 
eyes like snake’s eyes staring 
at Dunlop. 

“Speak more c-clearly,” 
Dunlop requested impatiently, 
twisting the key out of the 
lock. 

“I said,” repeated the thick 

FREDERIK POHL 




draiwl, “I’ve been waiting for 
you.” 

“Of course. What a t-terri- 
ble life you’ve led !” 

Crash went the door behind 
him ; Dunlop didn’t dare look. 
And this key insisted on stick- 
ing in its lock ! But he freed it 
and leaped to the Martian’s 
side — at least there they 
would not dare fire, for fear 
of destroying their meal- 
ticket ! 

“You c-can get us out of 
here,” Dunlop panted, fum- 
bling for the lock on the Mar- 
tian’s ankle cuff and gagging. 
(It was true. They did smell 



like rotting fish.) “B-but you 
must be strong! LaFitte has 
been a father to you, but what 
a f-false f-father ! Feel no loy- 
alty to him, Martian. He made 
you his slave, even if he d-did 
keep you healthy and s-sane.” 
And behind him LaFitte 
cleared his throat. “But I 
didn’t,” he observed. “I didn’t 
keep him sane.” 

“No,” rumbled the thick, 
slow Martian voice. “No, he 
didn’t.” 

The ropes that smelled like 
rotting fish closed lovingly and 
lethally around Dunlop. 

END 



SUPERWEAPON 

Few foes have been as great a challenge to man’s claim to supremacy 
on this planet as insects, and few, including perhaps his own kind, have 
inflicted such huge losses in life, health and wealth. Hands, swatters and 
drainage got a big assist in insect poisons, especially recently. But the 
tiny, deadly enemy has the advantage of brief generations; survival of 
the fittest has produced insecticide-resistant strains. And poisons aimed 
at insects all too often hit other forms of life, including ourselves, by 
getting into food and drinking water. 

Newest weapon in the insect war is sex. Totally selective, it can de- 
stroy only one or another species, not the beneficial as well as the 
destructive. 

The method itself is simpler by far than any other. Great numbers 
of the males of any chosen kind of insect are sterilized by cobalt-60 
radiation, and dropped into infested areas at breeding time. The sterilized 
males, says Dr. Arthur Lindquist, entomologist of the U. S. Department 
of Agriculture, “compete very successfully with the normal ones. The 
average result is that 60 to 70 per cent of the eggs laid are sterile and 
won’t hatch.” Repeated at each breeding season, the end result is total 
extermination in plague sections, with especial success on islands like 
Rota, near Guam, where weekly drops of three million sterile male fruit 
flies for a year should wipe out the devourers of its melons. 

For the first time in the history of mankind, complete — and completely 
safe — extinction of insect pests appears to be a realistic possibility.

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



C ONSIDER a story in which 
the mutated crew of an in- 
terstellar derelict forget that 
they are on a ship and revert 
to savagery; it is not Robert 
A. Heinlein’s Universe. Con- 
sider a story in which mutat- 
ed, intelligent rats strive for 
control of a spaceship against 
its human crew; it is not A. 
Bertram Chandler’s Giant 
Killer. 

These ingredients — as well 
as a good many others 
of reminiscent flavor — form 
Starship, a first novel by 
Brian Aldiss (Signet). 

Starship is described on its 
cover by a single, bare-faced 
adjective : “magnificent.” This 
is an exaggeration. But Aldiss 
comes very close indeed to de- 
serving such a word ! The 
book is vital. It is impossible 
to forget its precursors, but 
as the story builds and grows, 
we no longer worry about 
them. This is no dreary re- 
hash; this is a novel of taste 
and perception. 

Starship’s rats, once we 
realize that they are not the 
same as Giant Killer’s, become 
worthy inventions. They carry 
telepathic rabbits with them 
in their wars, for interrogat- 
ing human POWs. Their 
scouts are telepathic moths : a 



part of their lineage might 
well be Ralph Milne Farley’s 
“new-souls” of a generation 
back, but these moths are de- 
scribed in terms and with 
emotions that Farley never 
evoked. 

Indeed, Starship’s second 
flaw is an error on the side 
of the angels : its invention is 
over-abundant; there is so 
much in the book that Aldiss 
lets us glimpse a treasure only 
to whisk it away. His tele- 
pathic bunny is a triumph of 
compassionate characteriza- 
tion . shown once, never 
seen again. There is a novel 
tribal game, hinting at pro- 
vocative changes in social be- 
havior. But the first match we 
see is the last one. 

No matter. Roy Complain, 
Starship’s hero, battles his 
way through the ponic-tan- 
gled jungles of the corridors, 
past human and non-human 
foes to the enemy country 
called “Forwards” ... to the 
semi-mythical Control Room 
itself . and finally to a 
denouement that is skillful, 
fast and convincing. And we 
are with him all the way. 
Magnificent? No, the word is 
too strong. But it is only an 
exaggeration, not an outright 
lie. 



99 




It is good to know that this 
first novel is shortly to be fol- 
lowed by at least two more in 
this country. Brian Aldiss 
shows every sign of being a 
writer of imagination and 
power; it will not need much 
to make him one of the great 
ones. 

A YEAR or so ago the 
Seminar Committee of 
Princeton University invited 
Kingsley Amis (a name which 
seldom appears in print with- 
out the immediate addition of 
the phrase, “one of England’s 
Angry Young Men”) to deliv- 
er a series of lectures in 
Princeton’s Christian Gauss 
Seminars in Criticism. Amis 
accepted, and for his subject 
elected to discuss science fic- 
tion in its modern form. 

It is not on record whether 
the Seminar Committee was 
pleased or otherwise at his 
choice. But it is known, 
first, that Princeton’s faculty 
turned out in large number 
for the seminars when, in 
early 1959, they were deliv- 
ered and, second, that the 
faculty was nearly crowded 
out by the influx of editors 
and publishers from New 
York and Philadelphia anx- 
ious to get an authoritative 
fresh view on just what it 
was that they themselves 
were doing. 

Harcourt, Brace has now 
made it possible for those who 
missed the seminars to get 
that view all the same, now

enlarged, indexed, handsome- 
ly bound and available to all 
in book form under the title, 
New Maps of Hell. Examina- 
tions of science fiction have 
appeared often in the past 
decade, but this is not merely 
the newest of them. It is the 
best. 

Amis is himself a novelist 
— Lucky Jim, That Uncertain 
Feeling, etc. He is also a critic 
of substance, a poet, a jazz 
buff and a playwright (in 
which mood he wrote one of 
the few science fiction plays 
ever to find a home on the 
B.B.C.’s Third Programme). 
But these considerations are 
mostly irrelevant. New Maps 
of Hell demonstrates its au- 
thority at once. It proceeds 
immediately to a lucid and en- 
tertaining exposition of just 
what its author seeks in a sci- 
ence fiction story, and a sum- 
mary of what any person of 
similar tastes will reliably 
find. 

It is not necessary to ac- 
cept every one of Amis’s esti- 
mates. He is an Angry Young 
Man, as much as any writer 
of talent can be said to be 
any one thing, and what in- 
terests him most is the science 
fiction of comment, preferably 
social comment. Disagree- 
ment only indicates that one 
starts from other interests. 
Still, his estimates are formed 
with great care, and the test 
of a theory is the accuracy of 
the deductions that can be 
drawn from it. For example, 

FREDERIK POHL 




this reviewer is prepared to 
testify that Amis’s deduc- 
tions, as they relate to such 
“behind-the-scenes” matters 
as questions of intent and of 
the relative contributions of 
partners in a collaboration, 
are of a previously unprece- 
dented accuracy. 

Amis, like any true lover, 
neither demands perfection 
nor overlooks flaws. His con- 
clusion is that science fiction 
is indeed worth while, con- 
taining in it something of 
special value which is not to 
be found, except in trace 
quantities, anywhere else at 
all. “In the first place,” he 
says, “one is grateful for the 
presence of science fiction as 
a medium in which our society 
can criticize itself, and sharp- 
ly ... In the second place, 
one is grateful that we have 
a form of writing which is 
interested in the future, which 
is ready ... to treat as var- 
iables what are usually taken 
to be constants, which is set 
on tackling those large, gen- 
eral, speculative questions 
that ordinary fiction so often 
avoids. This is no less true 
when all allowance has been 
made for the shock and pain 
felt by some when they find 
those questions answered in 
a way that does much less 
than justice to their complex- 
ity. Most answers to anything 
are overwhelmingly likely to 
be crude, and I cannot bring 
myself to believe that the 
most saturating barrage of 

WORLDS OF IF 



crude answers really menaces 
the viability of the sensitive 
and intelligent answer ; if that 
were the way the world work- 
ed, it would long since have 
stopped working altogeth- 
er .. We could do with 
more, not less, of that habit 
of mind which will look be- 
yond the attempted solution 
of problems already evident 
to the attempted formulation 
of problems not yet distin- 
guishable. That is the path 
which science fiction ... is 
just beginning to tread, and 
if it can contrive to go on 
moving in that direction, it 
will not only have secured its 
future, but may make some 
contribution to the security 
of our own.” 

I N The Best from Fantasy 
and Science Fiction ( Ninth 
Series) (Doubleday), Robert 
P. Mills gives us sixteen 
stories, a smattering of short 
poems and an unfortunately 
large number of flatulent 
jokes in the “Adventures of 
Ferdinand Feghoot” series. 
The level is high, though the 
Old Reliables on his list — 
Heinlein, Tenn, Bester, Stur- 
geon, Knight — mostly turn in 
inferior performances. Hein- 
lein’s “All You Zombies — ” is 
a smoking room joke warped 
into the semblance of a story ; 
Tenn’s Eastward Ho! with 
great labor nails down every 
implication to be found in the 
speculation that we may one 
day have to give America 

101 




back to the Indians; Bester, 
almost always brilliant, is in 
The Psi Man only flashy ; 
Sturgeon is opaque in his ex- 
ercise in metafiction, The 
Man Who Lost the Sea! and 
only Knight’s What Rough 
Beast? has the simultaneous 
qualities of competence, power 
and scope that we have a 
right to expect from all of 
these. In What Rough Beast?, 
Knight creates what is prob- 
ably his finest character, a 
mutant— or perhaps a Mes- 
siah — who can create worlds 
and destroy them. 

Good as it is, What Rough 
Beast? may not be quite the 
best story in the book. Two 
powerful contenders are Dan- 
iel Keyes’ Flowers for Alger- 
non, the rise and fall of a 
laboratory-produced super- 
man, and R. M. McKenna’s 
Casey Agonistes, a fantasy 
laid in the terminal lung-dis- 
ease ward of a V. A. hospital. 
There are other attractive en- 
tries by Jane Rice and Avram 
Davidson, but there are also 
half a dozen of the Feghoot 
jokettes, in which some 150 
words are used to enchain a 
sitting duck, at which a gassy 
pun is fired. (Sample: “Bards 
of a fetter flog to get ’er,” 
says Feghoot of a whipping 
contest among pilloried poets 
with a virgin as the prize.) 

For comparison, Ace has 
just reissued the Third Series 
of the same, containing 
stories by Farmer, Gresham, 
de Camp-Pratt, Bester and 

102 



Boucher, among others. The 
stories date from the series’ 
sugar-coated period. They are 
charming, competent and 
guaranteed roughage-free. 
They are also quite forget- 
table. It may be that even 
Ferdinand Feghoot is not too 
high a price to pay for prog- 
ress. 

O THER reissues include 
Robert A. Heinlein’s Me- 
thuselah’s Children (Signet), 
not the best of the future his- 
tories but still a fine evening’s 
reading. The first half is a 
tightly plotted, carefully de- 
tailed story of immortals 
among humanity, with their 
problems and plans. The sec- 
ond, unhappily, becomes a 
sort of wishy-washy travel- 
ogue . Bantam has reissued 
Agnew H. Bahnson, Jr.’s The 
Stars Are Too High, a story 
of a flying saucer which has 
not even the virtue of extra- 
terrestrial origin to relieve its 
dullness. ... A more impres- 
sive reprint is Tom Godwin’s 
Space Prison (Pyramid), 
which is his 1958 Gnome 
Press novel, The Survivors. 
Godwin imagines that a band 
of interstellar pioneers, ma- 
rooned on an almost uninhab- 
itable planet by a conquering, 
superpowerful race of aliens, 
can in several centuries so im- 
prove their physical strength 
and resourcefulness as to gull, 
trap and finally defeat these 
aliens — first their scout ship 
(with bare hands), ultimately 

FREDERIK POHL 




their whole blooming empire. 
Now this is preposterous. Yet 
Godwin miraculously brings it 
all off. The people become 
real. Their scrabbling battle 
for survival excites compas- 
sion and respect. And, when 
they win, it is a most hard- 
shelled reader who will not 
rejoice. 

Signet, under its new “Sig- 
net Classics” imprint, has put 
back in print sixteen fine 
books. Bronte, Dickens, Tol- 
stoy and such make up most 
of their list, but among the 
sixteen are Gulliver’s Travels, 
Virginia Woolf’s delightful 
and strange Orlando, and 
George Orwell’s Animal 
Farm. Each book contains a 
critical or reminiscent intro- 
duction or postscript, and the 
packages are handsomely 
dressed. 

D O THEY esp or do they 
cheat? In The Mind 
Readers (Doubleday), S. G. 
Soal and H. T. Bowden make 
no bones about it: They say 
their subjects esp. Said sub- 
jects are a pair of Welsh 
teen-agers with surly dispo- 
sitions, a propensity for fak- 
ing results when they think 
they can get away with it and 
a spy-proof secret code for 
communication between them- 
selves — the Welsh language, 
“which few Englishmen can 
ever learn.” Nevertheless, 
their cheating seems to have 
occurred at only one brief pe- 
riod. (Youthful mischief?) 

WORLDS OF IF 



Their dispositions and their 
bilingualism make the tests 
more difficult but do not in- 
validate them. And, over a se- 
ries of more than 17,000 
tests, the boys produced high- 
er-than-chance recognition of 
Rhine-type ESP cards with 
astonishing reliability. These 
were not mere squiggles on 
the graph, six right, seven 
right. These were 20 out of 
25, 21 out of 25 — on two occa- 
sions, 25 out of 25 trials ! 

As reading matter, the 
book’s minutely pettifogging 
precision of statement makes 
it downright tiresome. A 
redeeming human sidelight 
comes in the collection of com- 
mentaries by other parapsy- 
chologists appended to the 
book. J. B. Rhine was one of 
those invited to comment ; 
here, nettled, he thanks Dr. 
Soal for the invitation. It is, 
he says, “a compliment I ap- 
preciate. I say this because, 
in his private correspondence 
and published statements over 
the years, Dr. Soal has been, 
at one stage or another, one 
of the most harshly unfavour- 
able (and, to my mind, un- 
fair) among the critics of the 
researches with which I have 
been associated.” And Dr. 
Soal’s own researches, Rhine 
reflects, look “disproportion- 
ately large to him and the 
work of everyone else com- 
paratively small and distorted 
. But, I am inclined to 
think, it may be that this very 
capacity for intense pre-occu- 

103 




pation with one’s own inquiry 
to the exclusion of everybody 
else’s is necessary to this 
man.” 

I N Strange World of the 
Moon (Basic Books), V. A. 
Firsoff combines a scrupu- 
lous reporting of virtually 
every recorded fact about our 
biggest and oldest satellite 
with an equally scrupulous 
but clearly mind-made-up 
weighing of the theories that 
explain them. The Moon did 
not, he says, come out of the 
basin of the Pacific. Its crat- 
ers were not, he says, formed 
either by meteorite impact or 
by the flow of molten rock 
from Earth-type volcanoes. It 
was indeed something like 
volcanic action that did it, he 
says, but the differences are 
so considerable that he will 
not call the things “volcanoes” 
at all, preferring the coined 
word “lunavoes,” vents from 
the Moon’s interior which re- 
lease gas and a sort of warm- 
ish mud. 

Firsoff’s Moon is, as he 
says, “a living world, (not) 
the conventional idea of a ball 
of terrestrial rocky desert 
raised to a high atmospheric 
level and made to revolve once 
a month.” It is a world of 
color (red, blue, green, violet, 
brown and yellow have all 
been observed) and of change 
(features disappear, mark- 
ings alter shape and color). 
Firsoff has his own explana- 
tions for much of these 



curiosities, but he is also 
faithful in transmitting the 
theories put forth by others, 
including Pickering’s conjec- 
ture that the changes in 
markings around the crater 
Eratosthenes may be caused 
by “ ‘small animals’ moving 
at a rate of 6 inches per 
hour.” 

To the lay reader Firsoff 
is most persuasive, and he is 
gifted with the most pleasur- 
able capacity for being both 
complete and clear. Short of 
tomorrow’s actual landings, 
this is the best estimate we 
can form of Luna, its terrain 
and (so says Firsoff, again 
fully persuasive) its very pos- 
sible plant and animal life. 

J OHN Brunner’s Slavers of 
Space and Philip K. Dick’s 
Dr. Futurity combine in an 
Ace double volume of not 
quite total merit. Brunner 
starts with a pleasure-mad 
Earth, amply fed and served 
by colonies and robots. Earth- 
men spend most of their time 
in a wild carnival (described 
with ingenuity) and are 
viewed with great scorn by 
the other worlds in the Gal- 
axy (invented with thought 
and originality). There are, 
however, in addition to the 
robots, certain blue-skinned 
creatures called androids, 
perfectly human in every re- 
spect save color and a com- 
plete deficiency of civil rights : 
they can be killed, tortured, 
enslaved. A son of an ex- 



104 



FREDERIK POHL 




tremely wealthy Earth fam- 
ily forsakes pleasure and 
determines to end the abuses 
of the android trade. 

After some satisfactory ad- 
ventures, though, Brunner’s 
invention deserts him and the 
story takes a “surprise” twist 
which we cannot approve (as 
flimsy) and may not discuss 
(as giving away the payoff). 

An analogous fault mars 
Philip K. Dick’s equally in- 
ventive Dr. Futurity. A 21st 
century doctor is snatched by 
a time machine into a still 
farther future, the death-lov- 
ing world of the year 2405, 
where his healing skill is con- 
sidered a foul perversion, and 
he is at once entrapped into 
a complicated net of under- 
ground activities. 

The death-lovers have been 
constructed with attention to 
those corroborative details 
which give artistic verisimili- 
tude, and thus Dick's narra- 
tive is neither bald nor 
unconvincing. It is quite con- 
vincing. It is even hairy. What 
flaws the story is a really ex- 
cessive troweling-on of time 
paradoxes, so that most every- 
body turns out to be most any- 
body else. ... In mediocre 
stories neither of these end- 
ings would do any great harm ; 
but the bulk of these works is 
very far above mediocre. 

A NOTHER Ace double vol- 
ume gives us a double 
dose of Harlan Ellison. One 
side is The Man with Nine 

WORLDS OF IF 



Lives, described as a “novel.” 
It might more aptly be called 
a bag of tricks. Its plot line is 
complicated beyond any reas- 
onable demand an author 
might make on a reader, caus- 
ing its hero to assume totally 
irrelevant identities and work 
toward totally unconnected 
purposes, apparently for the 
sake of using up some old 
wordage lying around in the 
form of unrelated novelettes. 

The flip side is a collection 
of small, violent short stories 
under the title, A Touch of 
Infinity. A feature of this col- 
lection is the introductory 
paragraph which Ellison has 
written for each story, giving 
us either insight into his 
creative process (“It is al- 
ways wise for the writer to 
consciously haul himself up 
short by the shift key and 
write a change of pace 
story”), a comment on the 
vexed conflict between au- 
thor and editor (“I let him 
stick his own title on it, and 
since it was better, anyhow, 
what the hell”) or a glimpse 
of the early struggles of the 
artist (“Who the hell ever 
thought I’d wind up making 
my bread pounding a type- 
writer?”). The stories them- 
selves are light-years above 
the novel on the other side. 
With less rope, Ellison suc- 
ceeds in getting less tangled, 
and these are first-rate of 
their type. Their type is blood 
and thunder.

THE 

NON-ELECTRONIC 



Illustrated by MORROW 

1 WOULDN’T take five cents 
off a legitimate man, but if 
they want to gamble that’s 
another story. 

What I am is a genius, and 
I give you a piece of advice: 
Do not ever play cards with a 
stranger. The stranger might 
be me. Where there are degen- 
erate card players around I 
sometimes get a call. Not dice 
— I don’t have a machine to 
handle them. But with cards I 
have a machine to force the 
advantage. 

The first thing is a little 
radio receiver, about the size 
of a pack of cigarettes. You 
don’t hear any music. You 
feel it on your skin. The next 

106 






By E. MITTLEMAN 



thing is two dimes. You stick 
them onto you, anywhere you 
like. Some like to put them on 
their legs, some on their belly. 
Makes no difference, just so 
they’re out of sight. Each dime 
has a wire soldered to it, and 
the wires are attached to the 
little receiver that goes in 
your pocket. 

The other thing is the trans- 
mitter I carry around. 

My partner was a fellow 
named Henry. He had an elec- 
tronic surplus hardware busi- 
ness, but business wasn’t good 
and he was looking for a little 
extra cash on the side. It turns 
out that the other little whole- 
salers in the loft building 




where he has his business are 
all card players, and no pik- 
ers, either. So Henry spread 
the word that he was available 
for a gin game — any time at 
all, but he would only play in 
his own place — he was expect- 
ing an important phone call 
and he didn’t want to be away 
and maybe miss it. It never 
came; but the card players 
did. 

I was suposed to be his stock 
clerk. While Henry and the 
other fellow were working on 
the cards at one end of the 
room, I would be moving 
around the other — checking 
the stock, packing the stuff for 
shipment, arranging it on the 
shelves, sweeping the floor. I 
was a regular model worker, 
busy every second. I had to be. 
In order to see the man’s hand 
I had to be nearby, but I had 
to keep moving so he wouldn’t 
pay attention to me. 

And every time I got a look 
at his hand, I pushed the little 
button on the transmitter in 
my pocket. 

Every push on the button 
was a shock on Henry’s leg. 
One for spades, two for hearts, 
three for diamonds, four for 
clubs. 

Then I would tip the card: 
a short shock for an ace, two 
for a king, three for a queen, 
and so on down to the ten. A 
long and a short for nine, a 
long and two shorts for an 
eight ... it took a little mem- 
orizing, but it was worth it. 
Henry knew every card the 



other man held every time. 
And I got fifty per cent. 

W E DIDN’T annihilate the 
fish. They hardly felt 
they were being hurt, but we 
got a steady advantage, day 
after day. We did so well we 
took on another man — I can 
take physical labor or leave it 
alone, and I leave it alone 
every chance I get. 

That was where we first felt 
the trouble. 

Our new boy was around 
twenty. He had a swept-wing 
haircut, complete with tail 
fins. Also he had a silly laugh. 
Now, there are jokes in a card 
game — somebody taking a 
beating will sound off, to take 
away some of the sting, but 
nobody laughs because the 
cracks are never funny. But 
they were to our new boy. 

He laughed. 

He laughed not only when 
the mark made some crack, 
but a lot of the time when he 
didn’t. It got so the customers 
were looking at him with a lot 
of dislike, and that was bad 
for business. 

So I called him out into the 
hall. “Skippy,” I said — that’s 
what we called him, “lay off. 
Never rub it in to a sucker. 
It’s enough to take his 
money.” 

He ran his fingers back 
along his hair. “Can’t a fel- 
low express himself?” 

I gave him a long, hard un- 
healthy look. Express him- 
self? He wouldn’t have to. I’d 



107 




express him myself— express 
him right out of our setup. 

But before I got a chance, 
this fellow from Chicago came 
in, a big manufacturer named 
Chapo ; a wheel, and he looked 
it. He was red-faced, with 
hanging jowls and a big dol- 
lar cigar; he announced that 
he only played for big stakes 
. and, nodding toward the 
kid and me, that he didn’t 
like an audience. 

Henry looked at us miser- 
ably. But what was he going 
to do? If he didn’t go along, 
the word could spread that 
maybe there was something 
wrong going on. He had to 
play. “Take the day off, you 
two,” he said, but he wasn’t 
happy. 

I thought fast. 

There was still one chance. 
I got behind Chapo long 
enough to give Henry a wink 
and a nod toward the win- 
dow. Then I took Skippy by 
the elbow and steered him out 
of there. 

Down in the street I said, 
fast: “You want to earn your 
pay? You have to give me a 
hand — an eye is really what 
I mean. Don’t argue — just 
say yes or no.” 

He didn’t stop to think. 
“Sure,” he said. “Why not?” 

“All right;” I took him 
down the street to where they 
had genuine imported Japa- 
nese field glasses and laid out 
twenty bucks for a pair. The 
man was a thief, but I didn’t 
have time to argue. Right 

108 



across the street from Henry’s 
place was a rundown hotel. 
That was our next stop. 

The desk man in the scratch 
house looked up from his com- 
ic book. “A room,” I said. 
“Me and my nephew want a 
room facing the street.” And 
I pointed to the window of 
Henry’s place, where I wanted 
it to face. 

Because we still had a 
chance. With the field glasses 
and Skippy’s young, good eyes

and couldn’t be moved. But for I’ll say this for him, duck- 
ten bucks she could be. tail haircut and all, he set- 







tied right down to business. I 
made myself comfortable on 
the bed and rattled them off 
on the transmitter as he read 
the cards to me. I couldn’t see 
the players, didn’t know the 
score; but if he was giving 
the cards to me right, I was 
getting them out to Henry. 

I felt pretty good. I even be- 
gan to feel kindly toward the 
kid. At my age, bifocals are 
standard equipment, but to 
judge from Skippy ’s fast, sure 
call of the cards, his eyesight 
was twenty-twenty or better. 

After about an hour, Skippy 
put down the glasses and broke 
the news : the game was over. 

We took our time getting 
back to Henry’s place, so 
Chapo would have time to clear 
out. Henry greeted us with 
eight fingers in the air. 

Eight hundred? But before 
I could ask him, he was already 
talking: “Eight big ones! 

Eight thousand bucks! And 
how you did it, I’ll never 
know!” 

Well, eight thousand was 
good news, no doubt of that. 
I said, “That’s the old system, 
Henry. But we couldn’t have 
done it if you hadn’t steered 
the fish up to the window.” 
And I showed him the Japa- 
nese field glasses, grinning. 

But he didn’t grin back. He 
looked puzzled. He glanced to- 
ward the window. 

I looked too, and then I saw 
what he was puzzled about. It 
was pretty obvious that Henry 
had missed my signal. He and 

110 



the fish had played by the win- 
dow, all right. 

But the shade was down. 

W HEN I turned around to 
look for Skippy, to ask 
him some questions, he was 
gone. Evidently he didn’t want 
to answer. 

I beat up and down every 
block in the neighborhood un- 
til I spotted him in a beanery, 
drinking a cup of coffee and 
looking worried. 

I sat down beside him, quiet. 
He didn’t look around. The 
counterman opened his mouth 
to say hello. I shook my head, 
but Skippy said, “That’s all 
right. I know you’re there.” 

I blinked. This was a creep ! 
But I had to find out what was 
going on. I said, “You made a 
mistake, kid.” 

“Running out?” He shrug- 
ged. “It’s not the first mistake 
I made,” he said bitterly. “Get- 
ting into your little setup with 
the bugged game came before 
that.” 

I said, “You can always 
quit,” but then stopped. Be- 
cause it was a lie. He couldn’t 
quit — not until I found out how 
he read Chapo’s cards through 
a drawn shade. 

He said drearily, “You’ve 
all got me marked lousy, have- 
n’t you? Don’t kid me about 
Henry — I know. I’m not so 
sure about you, but it wouldn’t 
surprise me.” 

“What are you talking 
about?” 

“I can hear every word 

E. MITTLEMAN 




that’s on Henry’s mind,” he 
said somberly. “You, no. Some 
people I can hear, some I can’t ; 
you’re one I can’t.” 

“What kind of goofy talk is 
that?” I demanded. But, to tell 
you the truth, I didn’t think 
it was so goofy. The window 
shade was a lot goofier. 

“All my life,” said Skippy, 
“I’ve been hearing the voices. 
It doesn’t matter if they talk 
out loud or not. Most people I 
can hear, even when they don’t 
want me to. Field glasses? I 
didn’t need field glasses. I 
could hear every thought that 
went through Chapo’s mind, 
clear across the street. Henry 
too. That’s how I know.” He 
hesitated, looking at me. “You 
think Henry took eight thous- 
and off Chapo, don’t you? It 
was ten.” 

I said, “Prove it.” 

The kid finished his coffee. 
“Well,” he said, “you want to 
know what the counterman’s 
got on his mind?” He leaned 
over and whispered to me. 

I yelled, “That’s a lousy 
thing to say !” 

Everybody was looking at 
us. He said softly, “You see 
what it’s like? I don’t want to 
hear all this stuff! You think 
the counterman’s got a bad 
mind, you ought to listen in 
on Henry’s.” He looked along 
the stools. “See that fat little 
woman down at the end? She’s 
going to order another cheese 
Danish.” 

He hadn’t even finished 
talking when the woman was 

THE NON-ELECTRONIC BUG 



calling the counterman, and 
she got another cheese Danish. 
I thought it over. What he 
said about Henry holding out 
on me made it real serious. I 
had to have more proof. 

But I didn’t like Skippy’s 
idea of proof. He offered to 
call off what everybody in the 
beanery was going to do next, 
barring three or four he said 
were silent, like me. That was- 
n’t good enough. “Come along 
with me,” I told him, and we 
took off for Jake’s spot. 

That’s a twenty-four-hour 
place and the doorman knows 
me. I knew Jake and I knew 
his roulette wheel was gaffed. 
I walked right up to the wheel, 
and whispered to the kid, 
“Can you read the dealer?” 
He smiled and nodded. “All 
right. Call black or red.” 

The wheel spun, but that 
didn’t stop the betting. Jake’s 
hungry. In his place you can 
still bet for a few seconds 
after the wheel starts turn- 
ing. 

“Black,” Skippy said. 

I threw down fifty bucks. 
Black it was. 

That rattled me. 

“Call again,” I said. 

When Skippy said black, I 
put the fifty on red. Black won 
it. 

“Let’s go,” I said, and led 
the kid out of there. 

He was looking puzzled. 
“How come — ” 

“How come I played to 
lose?” I patted his shoulder. 
“Sonny, you got a lot to learn. 

Ill 




Jake’s is no fair game. This 
was only a dry run.” 

Then I got rid of him, be- 
cause I had something to do. 

H ENRY came across. He 
even looked embarrassed. 
“I figured,” he said, “uh, I 
figured that the expenses — ” 
“Save it,” I told him. “All 
I want is my split.” 

He handed it over, but I 
kept my hand out, waiting. 
After a minute he got the idea. 
He reached down inside the 
waistband of his pants, pulled 
loose the tape that held the 
dimes to his skin and handed 
over the radio receiver. 
“That’s it, huh?” he said. 
“That’s it.” 

“Take your best shot,” he 
said glumly. “But mark my 
words. You’re not going to 
make out on your own.” 

“I won’t be on my own,” I 
told him, and left him then. 
By myself? Not a chance! It 
was going to be Skippy and 
me, all the way. Not only 
could he read minds, but the 
capper was that he couldn’t 
read mine ! Otherwise, you 
can understand, I might not 
want him around all the time. 

But this way I had my own 
personal bug in every game in 
town, and I didn’t even have 
to spend for batteries. Card 
games, gaffed wheels, every- 
thing. Down at the track he 
could follow the smart-money 
guys around and let me know 
what they knew, which was 
plenty. We could even go up 



against the legit games in 
Nevada, with no worry about 
bluffs. 

And think of the fringe 
benefits! With Skippy giving 
the women a preliminary 
screening, I could save a lot 
of wasted time. At my age, 
time is nothing to be wasted. 

I could understand a lot 
about Skippy now — why he 
didn’t like most people, why 
he laughed at jokes nobody 
else thought were funny, or 
even could hear. But every- 
body has got to like somebody, 
and I had the edge over most 
of the human race. He didn’t 
know what I was thinking. 

And then, take away the 
voices in his head, and Skippy 
didn’t have much left. He 
wasn’t very smart. If he had 
half as much in the way of 
brains as he did in the way of 
private radar, he would have 
figured all these angles out for 
himself long ago. No, he need- 
ed me. And I needed him. We 
were all set to make a big 
score together, so I went back 
to his rooming house where 
I’d told him to wait, to get 
going on the big time. 

However, Henry had more 
brains than Skippy, 

I hadn’t told Henry who 
tipped me off, but it didn’t 
take him long to work out. 
After all, I had told him I was 
going out to look for Skippy, 
and I came right back and 
called him for holding out. No, 
it didn’t take much brains. All 
he had to do was come around

to Skippy’s place and give him 
a little lesson about talking. 

So when I walked in the 
door, Skippy was there, but 
he was out cold, with lumps 
on his forehead and a stupid 
grin on his face. I woke him 
up and he recognized me. 

But you don’t make your 
TV set play better by kicking 
it. You don’t help a fine Swiss 
watch by pounding it on an 
anvil. Skippy could walk and 
talk all right, but something 
was missing. “The voices !” he 
yelled, sitting up on the edge 
of the bed. 

I got a quick attack of cold 
fear. “Skippy! What’s the 
matter? Don’t you hear them 
any more?” 

He looked at me in a panic. 
“Oh, I hear them all right. But 
they’re all different now. I 
mean — it isn’t English any 
more. In fact, it isn’t any lan- 
guage at all!” 

L IKE I say, I’m a genius. 

Skippy wouldn’t lie to me ; 
he’s not smart enough. If he 
says he hears voices, he hears 
voices. 

Being a genius, my theory 
is that when Henry worked 
Skippy over, he jarred his 
tuning strips, or whatever it 
is, so now Skippy’s receiving 
on another frequency. Make 
sense? I’m positive about it. 



He sticks to the same story, 
telling me about what he’s 
hearing inside his head, and 
he’s too stupid to make it all 
up. 

There are some parts of it 
I don't have all figured out yet, 
but I’ll get them. Like what he 
tells me about the people — I 
guess they’re people — whose 
voices he hears. They’re 
skinny and furry and very re- 
ligious. He can’t understand 
their language, but he gets 
pictures from them, and he 
told me what he saw. They 
worship the Moon, he says. 
Only that’s wrong too, be- 
cause he says they worship 
two moons, and everybody 
knows there’s only one. But 
I’ll figure it out ; I have to, be- 
cause I have to get Skippy 
back in business. 

Meanwhile it’s pretty lone- 
some. I spend a lot of time 
down around the old neigh- 
borhood, but I haven’t set 
up another partner for taking 
the card players. That seems 
like pretty small stuff now. 
And I don’t talk to Henry 
when I see him. And I never 
go in the beanery when that 
counterman is on duty. I’ve 
got enough troubles in the 
world ; I don’t have to add to 
them by associating with his 
kind.

Still something there 
was more lethal than these ! 



By HAYDEN HOWARD 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



W AVELETS of cigarette 
smoke drifted across the 
comfortably lounging enlisted 
men in the air-conditioned 
compartment of the Fleet Bal- 
listic Missile submarine, as 
they sat watching Barney. 
Sweat streaming from his 
swollen-veined forehead, hur- 
ried and grotesque in his black 
rubber diving suit, exploding 
triumphant curses like under-; 
water demolition charges, 
Barney finished tightening the 
control cables of what resem- 
bled a torpedo with two open 
cockpits. “This time the little 1 



114 




gal raises her hydroplanes!” 

At this contrast of men, the 
Murderer had to grin, but 
carefully in order not to sweat 
and ruin the insulating quali- 
ties of his three woolen layers 
of longjohns. The submariners 
seemed quiet-talking and coop- 
erative, as well adjusted as 
sardines in a can. The diver, 
Barney, was foul-mouthed and 
fiercely individualistic, a won- 
derful guy — his diving buddy. 

A legend in his own time, 
Barney was reputed to have 
arisen from the mine-strewn 
waters of the Korean coast at 
the time of the Wonsan-In- 
chon landings to give advice 
to General MacArthur. 

As an TJnderwater Demoli- 
tion Team diver, Barney dated 
clear back into the Murderer’s 
childhood recollections of 
World War II, to dim names 
like Kwajalein and Guam, 
where former Seabees became 
combat divers to wire and 
blast Japanese underwater ob- 
stacles and leave welcoming 
signs for the Marines. 

Barney was only quiet 
about two things, his age and 
his circumference. He still 
fancied himself a baseball 
catcher, and his stubby fingers 
showed the deleterious effects 
of grabbing at foul tips with 
a bare hand, but those same 
fingers could expertly repair 
a wristwatch and the auto- 
matic transmission of an ad- 
miral’s car and hock one and 
"borrow” the other. 

Barney had managed to put 



his homely younger sister 
through college and was now 
maneuvering to marry her off 
to a lieutenant commander on 
the staff of Admiral Rickover. 
And he could expertly joke the 
fears out of his diving buddy. 

Winking at his comfortably 
smoke-filled audience, Barney 
dumped a sack of non-mag- 
netic tools into the forward 
cockpit of the minisub he per- 
sonally had built, and cocked 
his head. 

“Murderer, here, is hoping 
the villain is a sea serpent. 
Don’t laugh, you sea horses. 
The latest scuttlebutt from 
Alaska has it that every time 
a picket buoy goes dead out 
here under the ice, the last 
sound it broadcasts is a sort 
of toothy crunch.” 

H E pushed the joke a little 
further. “Turn your per- 
iscopes on the blade Mur- 
derer’s wearing! John Paul 
Jones used to issue those for 
cutlasses! Murderer’s hoping 
to fight the sea serpent hand 
to hand.” 

His grin widening with em- 
barrassment, the Murderer 
felt called upon to retort. “I’ll 
give you a better suspect for 
stealing our picket buoys. San- 
ta Claus. These are his terri- 
torial waters. Are you aware 
that in the Middle Ages Santa 
Claus was the patron saint of 
thieves?” 

“Now, Mr. College Boy,” 
Barney began, "you just want 
to show us you also studied 

115 




history, not just marine bi- 
ology. This boy will even tell 
you a long Latin name for a 
little something that floats 
like dandruff in the water.” 
A touch of pride appeared in 
Barney’s voice. “He can tell 
you its whole life history and 
what eats it and why it’s im- 
portant and why it will be a 
lot more important fifty years 
from now when your kids will 
need a lot more food from the 
sea.” 

There was a perceptible 
slowing, and the weird sound 
from the atomic submarine’s 
heat-exchanger muted. Barney 
glanced at his pressure-proof 
watch. The Murderer tensed. 

“This college boy may look 
like a tennis player,” Barney 
went on as if nothing had 
happened, “but in the water, 
when Murderer sees some- 
thing swimming down there, 
he doesn’t care how big it is. 
We were installing the broad- 
cast aerial from a picket buoy 
up through ice, and Murderer 
had just retracted the mag- 
nesium flare pole, so I’m half- 
blinded. I look down. I see 
something so big I want to 
get out of there on a bicycle. 
But down Murderer swims 
with the magnesium flare in 
one hand and his cutlass in 
the other. It’s a shark as big 
as a small whale. The flare 
hypnotizes it, and round and 
round they go, with Murderer 
stabbing away, letting in sea 
water until that shark bugs 
out of there like a bare-bot- 

116 



tomed boy from a swarm of 
bumblebees !” 

The Murderer studied his 
depth gauge to cover his em- 
barrassment. The reason the 
shark had been so big was that 
it belonged to a species with 
the whale-like habit of strain- 
ing the water for minute 
crustaceans. It was harmless 
and had winced from his first 
thrust. Then its shagreen hide 
had tensed to armor-tough- 
ness, and it had been like try- 
ing to stab a submarine. It 
left because it had no reason 
to stay. 

“I’m relieved," one of the 
submariners laughed, “that 
stabbing fish is how he got 
the name Murderer.” 

“Not only fish,” Barney 
went on enthusiastically. 
“This boy almost got himself 
court-martialed. We’re work- 
ing from the icebreaker, out 
from Point Barrow, diving 
from a whaleboat, and before 
the Annapolis ensign can say 
a word Murderer’s over the 
side. We put our face-plates 
in the water. He’s bubbling 
down on a walrus! I swear, 
he rides it like a bucking 
horse. You need a long blade 
in the arctic. And ugly — 
when we bent a cable to that 
walrus from the icebreaker, 
the walrus stalled the winch !” 
“What about tusks ?” a sub- 
mariner’s voice asked. 

T HE Murderer had been 
well aware of tusks. For 
three days he had been study- 

HAYDEN HOWARD 




ing the walrus herd with fas- 
cination. These staring-eyed, 
noisy mammals were living in 
icy water that would numb 
and kill a man in a few min- 
utes. 

Some of them were diving 
to clam beds more than two 
hundred and fifty feet down, 
where their bodies were sub- 
jected to a pressure of more 
than eight atmospheres. In 
shallower water where cock- 
les predominated, he had actu- 
ally observed them raking the 
muddy bottom with their 
tusks and rising with great 
disintegrating masses of mud 
and shells between their flip- 
pers. Few men had ever seen 
that. 

He marveled at the evolu- 
tionary process by which some 
primitive land mammal of the 
Eocene Period had become the 
walrus. 

W HY he had swum down 
and attacked a walrus, 
he did not know. Afterward 
he felt ashamed, not just be- 
cause it was a dumb thing 
to do and he’d had three ribs 
cracked and should have been 
killed; not because it was a 
show-off thing, with sailors 
urging him to stand in front 
of its hoisted body so they 
could take pictures for their 
girl friends ; not because 
Barney lost his appetite for 
a couple of days and didn’t 
seem very eager to dive near 
the herd. What bothered him 
was the indescribable feeling 

MURDER BENEATH THE POLAR ICE 



he’d had as he swam down 
with his knife to the walrus, 
a feeling closer than hun- 
ger .. 

“When we get back. I’ll 
show you the photographs,” 
Barney was insisting proudly. 
“When they assigned this boy 
as my diving buddy, they sent 
his name along. Murderer. If 
it swims. Murderer will go 
down after it, they said. And 
they weren’t lying.” 

But that was not how the 
name originated. Sitting there 
in the drifting cigarette 
smoke, feeling the sweat soak 
through his longjohns, the 
Murderer wished the sub- 
marine’s commander would 
hurry up and decide on a po- 
sition, let them out of the boat, 
get it over with. 

Probably by now, even the 
guys who were in U.D.T. 
training with him believed he 
got the name by murdering 
fish. 

They gave the name to 
him, but it was during an ori- 
entation meeting with dia- 
grams and graphs and talk of 
megatons and current-borne 
radioactivity and a model of 
an atomic depth charge on the 
table. An incredulous revul- 
sion had come over him, this 
mindlessly mechanical can of 
death that could poison, could 
make useless two billion strug- 
gling years of life, all wasted, 
single-celled ancestors, di- 
atoms, copepods, wondrous 
fish. 

During the discussion, he 

117 




had kept exclaiming: “It’s 
murder! It's murder!” This 
was how he had acquired his 
name. 

“Hey, Murderer,” one of the 
submariners laughed. “You 
should cut off a sea serpent 
steak for the skipper. I bet 
he’d go for one.” 

“Speaking of murderers,” 
the Murderer blurted, sud- 
denly detesting the name, 
raising his clean-cut, angrily 
intelligent face, flooding his 
longjohns with angry sweat, 
“you all are potential mur- 
derers — on a big scale. Let’s 
say ten thousand victims 
apiece. I kill a few fish, so I’m 
a murderer? But you are all 
gears and cogs of a mass pro- 
duction murder mechanism 
called a Fleet Ballistic Missile 
submarine. An impersonal 
machine that — ” 

“Not impersonal,” the com- 
mander’s voice said clearly as 
he came into the compart- 
ment. “This boat is just an- 
other tool f or survival — like a 
shield or spear. Men make the 
decisions for it.” 

B ARNEY said in an attempt 
to ease the tension, “You 
want us to bring you any ice 
cubes, Commander?” 

The commander’s gray eyes 
studied Barney’s red-veined 
ones. “Just bring yourselves 
back, Barney. We’ll settle for 
that.” He touched the mini- 
sub. “All I can say is we think 
we’re in the sector where the 
picket buoys shorted out. 

118 



There’ve been such meager 
appropriations for hydro- 
graphic surveys in the Arctic 
Ocean, we haven’t a very clear 
picture of fathometer land- 
marks even in this sector. So 
the navigator has depended 
pretty heavily on his dead reck- 
oning and inertial navigation. 
What I’m getting at is don’t 
spend too much time looking. 
Use conservative search pat- 
terns. Give yourself plenty of 
margin to find your way home 
to us. We’ll do our best to hold 
this position.” 

Slowly, the commander 
smiled. “We’ll keep the coffee 
hot until you get back.” 

The Murderer watched 
them roll the minisub along on 
its cradle and into the 
chamber. From the stem, the 
minisub looked less like a tor- 
pedo. Instead of the compact 
round propeller blades associ- 
ated with high speeds under 
water, the minisub had long 
narrow blades which might 
have looked more appropriate 
on a Wright Brother’s air- 
plane. These would unwind 
through the water so slowly 
there would be no cavitation, 
no tell-tale bubbling sounds. 

“One last thing,” the com- 
mander said, including the 
Murderer in his gray gaze. 
“No aggressive action. If you 
should meet — someone — break 
off contact in a dignified man- 
ner and come home.” 

Strangely, the commander 
smiled again and glanced at 
his watch. “Right about now, 

HAYDEN HOWARD 




my two kids are waking from 
their afternoon naps and run- 
ning out into the backyard in 
their underpants to swing on 
the swings. No aggressive ac- 
tion, O.K.?” 

The Murderer felt thankful 
he was not the commander — 
with the responsibility for 
sixteen hydrogen-warheaded 
Polaris missiles on his back. 

Weighted down by his air 
tanks, the Murderer crawled 
into the chamber beside the 
minisub and reached into the 
stern cockpit. He unreeled a 
few feet of the red wire and 
plugged it into the chest socket 
of his electric suit warmer. 
Out there, you couldn’t search 
very long without battery heat 
from the minisub. 

Automatically checking his 
full-face mask, he connected 
with the black wire and tested 
his throat mike, earplug cir- 
cuit. “One — two — three — ” 

“Four — shut the door,” 
Barney’s voice croaked weird- 
ly. For complicated two-man 
disassemblies underwater, the 
traditional hand signals were 
not enough. The minisub acted 
as a telephone exchange. 

T URNING from the mini- 
sub, Barney plugged into 
the telephone connection in 
the wall of the chamber, giv- 
ing them the word. From the 
way the Arctic Ocean fire- 
hosed into the chamber, the 
Murderer guessed they had at 
least a hundred feet of water 
standing on them. This cap- 

MURDER BENEATH THE POLAR ICE 



tain had no intention of 
smashing his periscopes on 
pack ice. 

Wryly, the Murderer grin- 
ned while the water crept up 
his body. He knew the limiting 
factor in their search for a 
picket buoy, any picket buoy, 
was the survival time in their 
air tanks. As for the mini- 
sub, it had the capability of 
keeping their corpses warm 
for several hours thereafter. 
With its gyroscope efficiently 
clicking commands to the rud- 
der, it would maintain a 
straighter course than any 
man could steer. If it could 
eat fish and reproduce it- 
self . 

The waterline rose above 
his glass face-plate. On the 
curved ceilings of the cham- 
ber, the air shrank into a 
squirming bubble. The pres- 
sure had been equalized. 
There was a cold metallic 
screech as Barney opened the 
outer hatch into the Arctic 
Ocean. 

Valving an additional hiss 
of compressed air into the 
minisub’s forward flotation 
tank, the Murderer gave it a 
gentle push and rode it out, 
his hand on the air release 
valve now to prevent the in- 
creasingly buoyant minisub 
from falling upward against 
the white-glaring underside of 
the ice pack. 

“There’s a hell of a current 
up here,” Barney’s voice 
croaked. 

The Murderer glanced 

119 




down, and his free arm clutch- 
ed the cockpit in an anthro- 
poidal fear-reflex of falling. 
The water was that clear. 
Down there, the submarine 
seemed to drift away like a 
great dirigible in the wind, 
but the Murderer knew the 
minisub was actually doing 
the drifting. 

“Tinker carefully with your 
gyroscope, Mr. Navigator,” 
Barney laughed, “and we’ll go 
take a look for your sea ser- 
pent.” 

He gave Barney a straight 
course into the current. The 
Murderer had had nightmares 
of being lost under the arctic 
ice pack. 

“Keep an eye peeled on the 
ice,” Barney muttered, but 
the Murderer kept both eyes 
on the instruments and gave 
Barney a one-hundred-eighty- 
degree change of course, try- 
ing to determine the speed of 
the current. 

“One way’s as good as an- 
other,” Barney laughed. 

Unfortunately, this had to 
be a visual search. The draw- 
ing-board boys had designed 
the picket buoys so they 
would not be detected, and 
thoughtfully made them self- 
destroying in case they were. 
If anywhere near, a subma- 
rine would be recorded, and 
the under-ice warning system 
had actually worked against 
their own submarines. But the 
picket buoys in this sector, one 
by one, had died without a 
warning sound except, as scut- 

120 



tlebutt would have it, a toothy 
crunch. 

“This pack ice has changed,” 
Barney’s voice muttered. 

Barney and the Murderer 
had been one of the diving 
teams out there when a sub- 
marine ejected the buoys be- 
neath the polar ice. A buoy 
would squirt from a torpedo 
tube. When the non-magnetic 
float struck the underside of 
the ice. metal rods clutched 
upward like the legs of a 
spider clinging to the ice. A 
thread-like cable lowered the 
tiny instrument capsule into 
the depths. The capsule’s 
small size was intended to foil 
typical mine detection sonar, 
while the float was supposed 
to merge with irregularities of 
sonic reflection on the under- 
side of the ice. Some admiral 
had even ordered the floats 
painted white, but they still 
cut off light and appeared 
dark from beneath the ice. 

A FTER the divers had melt- 
ed a quick hole through 
two or three feet of pack ice 
and extended the whip-like 
aerial into the polar air, head- 
quarters could keep track of 
the drifting buoy’s location. 
Intermittently, for the classi- 
fied number of years the bat- 
teries were supposed to last, 
each buoy would broadcast its 
own identification code, only 
coming through with a high 
wattage warning when its in- 
strument capsule in the depths 
of the Arctic Ocean was awak-

MURDER BENEATH THE POUR ICE 



ened. The joker here, the Mur- 
derer thought, was that the 
aerials might be hard to see, 
but any simple fool could 
make himself a radio location 
finder. Live buoys could be 
hunted from the surface ice. 

“How dry I am,” Barney’s 
voice croaked unmusically, 
“how dry I be, nobody knows 
— nobody cares — ” 

Now the white underside 
of the ice drooped in down- 
ward bulges, indicating thick- 
er masses of old ice that had 
been frozen into the pack. The 
Murderer saw the gray outline 
of driftwood entombed in this 
old ice. 

“Drift ice from the Siberian 
rivers,” Barney croaked. 
“When we planted the picket 
buoys, our sector didn’t have 
any of this.” 

The Murderer looked down 
at his instruments, preparing 
to change course. 

“My God, look!” Barney’s 
voice croaked, and his black 
rubber arm pointed upward. 

The Murderer’s breathing 
stopped as he made out some- 
thing quivering up there. 
“What is it?” 

“Animal, vegetable or min- 
eral,” Barney wheezed. “If it’s 
animal, I don’t want to be 
around when whatever laid 
these eggs comes back.” 

Swaying up there on the 
underside of the ice in a ge- 
latinous mass at least twenty 
feet across, it resembled a 
mass of gigantic frog’s eggs. 

But the Murderer decided 

122 



there was too great a varia- 
tion in size for them to be 
eggs. Those nearest the out- 
side of the mass seemed clear- 
er, more transparent, than the 
surrounding gelatinous sub- 
stance. The Murderer’s excite- 
ment began to fade. 

“They’re not eggs,” he 
said disappointedly. “I think 
they’re only bubbles encased 
in some sort of soft plastic.” 

“Mineral,” Barney said 
with some relief in his voice. 
“Now I see that dark part in 
the middle has the shape of a 
can. The bubbles must be to 
float a mine or secret mecha- 
nism,” his voice ended excited- 
ly. Barney wanted nothing to 
do with live things; he liked 
mechanical devices that click- 
ed and buzzed and could be 
taken apart and then put back 
together. 

He eased the minisub up to- 
ward the gelatinous mass. 

“Don’t bring the minisub 
too close,” the Murderer gasp- 
ed, imagining a mechanical 
click as the impersonal gadg- 
etry within the can detected 
their approach and cocked the 
lifeless steel prongs of a deto- 
nator. 

Barney laughed in excited 
contrast. “Even our air tanks 
are non-magnetic. Or if it’s 
hydrophonic, the noise level to 
set it off would have to be 
plenty high, because of all the 
crunching sounds every day 
in the ice. I’m going to find out 
what it is.” 

Barney rose from his cock-

pit, trailing his green-stained 
canvas bag of non-magnetic 
tools. 

“You’re not going to cut 
into it, are you?” the Murder- 
er cried. 

“That’s what the taxpayers 
pay me for — to protect them 
from — you name it. Murderer, 
you sail the minisub off until 
all my telephone cable is out. 
Just like when we practiced 
disarming our picket buoys,

make w

“Take notes on your naviga-

ly up and down. “This jello’s 
tougher than it looks. Very 
ingenious. I’ll bet this was a 
compact little bundle when a

can up to the underside of 
the ice. 

“This is important,” Bar- 
ney’s voice croaked on. “I’ve 
come to some thin shiny wires. 

124 



They seem to be all through 
the jello and to curve back in 
toward the can.” 

The Murderer clenched his 
hand. He could feel the ten- 
dons and imagine the wonder- 
fully intricate nerves of his 
living hand. He’d been fright- 
ened many times under the 
sea. Occasionally divers talk- 
ed about which way they’d 
rather go. Nitrogen narcosis 
was popular among the heavy 
drinkers. Barney’s choice — a 
nice close mine explosion be- 
cause it would be so quick. 
They thought the Murderer 
was crazy when he said he’d 
rather be eaten by a Great 
White Shark than smashed 
by some miserable explosive 
gadget. 

“Now I’m spreading two 
wires apart,” Barney said 
calmly, “but I’ve left a layer 
of gelatin around each of 
them. I will not cut the wires 
and I’ll try not to let them 
touch eaeh other.” 

Gradually his head and 
shoulders disappeared up into 
the gelatinous mass. 

“Don’t snag your tanks or 
regulator on a wire,” the Mur- 
derer breathed. 

“Now I’m cutting within a 
few inches of the base of the 
can.” Only Barney’s kicking 
legs showed. “My air is filling 
the cut — and I’m going — to 
open a — chimney.” Bubbles 
emerged from the side of the 
swaying mass. 

“Suppose this thing is 
atomic,” the Murderer said. 

HAYDEN HOWARO 




“It would crush our ballistic 
missile sub from here.” 

“This is peacetime, boy. No- 
body’s fool enough to let an 
atomic mine go drifting 
around with the ice.” 

The Murderer looked down 
at the hard metal shell of the 
minisub. You could blast and 
smash it, and it would still be 
metal. You even could vapor- 
ize it, and its atomic parti- 
cles would be somewhere — or 
changed into energy — but 
nothing really lost, because it 
had never been alive. The 
Murderer thought of the com- 
mander’s two kids waking 
from their naps. It had taken 
life two billion years to get 
that far, and it all could be 
lost. Right now, was Barney 
committing aggressive action? 

He thought again of that 
orientation class where they 
theoretically learned how to 
disarm an unexploded atomic 
depth charge. He had express- 
ed his feeling that these atom- 
ic charges were murder. The 
fools had laughed and begun 
calling him Murderer. 

“The bottom of this can is 
as blank,” Barney said, “as a 
sailor in one of those modem 
art museums. I’m going to cut 
my way along the side of the 
can and see what I can see.” 

A little fish, perhaps lost 
from its school, peered into 
the Murderer’s glass face- 
plate. Its wondrous eye grew 
inquisitively larger, and he 
thought of the millions of co- 
operating cells that made up 

MURDER BENEATH THE POLAR ICE 



its eye and optic nerve and 
receiving brain and the mar- 
vel that the individually drift- 
ing cells of two billion years 
ago could have achieved this. 

There was a contradiction, 
he thought. He was amazed by 
life and yet he speared fish. 
Did he enjoy feeling life wrig- 
gle on the end of his spear? 

“I’ve reached the top,” Bar- 
ney’s voice croaked. “There’s a 
rod here — get this, a vertical 
rod. It extends up into the ice 
like with the aerials of our 
picket buoys. I knew it wasn’t 
a mine. This is how they plan 
to detect our atomic subma- 
rines. This will make a very 
interesting present for Ad- 
miral Rickover — ” 

At this instant there was 
a darkening slap against the 
Murderer’s mask. His ear- 
drums burst inward. His in- 
testines squeezed up into his 
chest from the force of the 
underwater explosion. He 
blacked out. 

I CE water seared his face. 

He was drowning. Convul- 
sively, his hand groped for his 
mask. The glass was intact. 
His hand dragged the mask 
back to a proper fit upon his 
face, and compressed air forc- 
ed out the sea water. He could 
feel the telephone cord pulling 
at his mask. 

Everything was blinding 
white, and he realized he was 
belly up beneath the ice. “Bar- 
ney?” 

The telephone wire began 

125 




to drag him down head first, 
and he went down it hand 
over hand toward the slowly 
sinking minisub. “Barney?” 
Further down, he saw Bar- 
ney’s black rubber suit 
spread-eagled and sinking, 
and he swam clumsily down 
past the minisub. He clutched 
Barney’s black rubber arm 
and dragged it toward the 
minisub. The black rubber suit 
seemed to have no bones. 
Everything drooped and sway- 
ed as he tried to fit Barney 
into the stern cockpit. When 
he wrapped Barney’s wires to 
tie him in, they came face to 
face. There was no glass in 
Barney’s mask. The glass had 
burst where the face had been. 




Barney’s death. 

Dragging himself into Bar- 
ney’s forward cockpit, he valv- 
ed air into the minisub’s 
forward flotation tank, raising 
the torpedo-like nose. It was 
then that he saw them up 
there, silhouetted small and 
frog-like against the blinding 
white ice, two divers. 

The two silhouettes were 
looking down at him, and he 
knew they had been attracted 
by the explosion of their gelat- 
inous picket buoy. He looked 
all around for the dim gray 
outline of their submarine, but 
there was no sign of their 
“home,” and his gaze concen- 
trated with wide-eyed inten- 
sity on their black paddling 

126 



shapes as his minisub rose 
from the depths. 

He saw them exchange hur- 
ried hand signals. They began 
to swim away, side by side, 
their fins fluttering rapidly 
now. They were swimming a 
definite course, and still there 
was no sign of their subma- 
rine as his minisub inexorably 
gained on them. 

Now that he had reached 
their altitude, he noticed they 
were already tiring. One diver 
looked back, then swam fran- 
tically to catch up with the 
other. Like a slow fighter 
plane, the minisub came in on 
them from behind, and one 
diver pushed at the other. 
They again exchanged hand 
signals, losing yards to the 
minisub, and one began to 
swim hard while the other 
turned back, facing the mini- 
sub, raising his hand in what 
appeared to be a courteous 
military salute. The minisub 
kept coming straight at him. 

Then the diver spread his 
arms in a gesture of peace. 
The minisub’s torpedo-shaped 
nose rammed his belly. Un- 
sheathing his long blade, the 
Murderer struck. 

As the diver wriggled, the 
Murderer withdrew the blade 
and struck again. Air bubbles 
streamed from the diver’s 
chest with each exhalation of 
breath as he backwatered. His 
expression seemed mild sur- 
prise as the Murderer struck 
a third time, driving the blade 
down between the man’s neck 



HAYDEN HOWARD 




and collar bone, pushing him 
deeper. The next blow smash- 
ed the mask. Belatedly, the 
man’s hand flurried, seeming 
to clutch at his bubbles as he 
sank. 

The Murderer looked up. 
Far off under the ice, the 
other diver had stopped, was 
looking down, watching, and 
the Murderer held up his 
blade as a signal and turned 
the minisub upward, after 
him. This diver took evasive 
action among the downward 
bulges of old Siberian ice and 
suddenly vanished. 

Although there was no sky 
glare in the water, the Mur- 
derer supposed the diver had 
found an open lead in the ice 
and would rather freeze to 
death, or at least put up a fight 
from the edge of the ice, than 
die in the water. 

V ALVING more air into the 
minisub’s flotation tanks, 
the Murderer steered it rapid- 
ly up into the oddly round, 
oddly dim lead in the ice pack. 
At the edge of his mask-vision 
he glimpsed a longish tubular 
shape suspended in the water, 
but the minisub was rising too 
fast for him to get a good look. 
The overbuoyant minisub 
bloomed above the surface and 
sloshed back, rolling unstead- 
ily while the film of water slid 
off his mask without freezing 
and he saw. 

The white blur became the 
biggest twin-rotored copter he 
had ever seen, squatting there 

MURDER BENEATH THE POLAR ICE 



on the ice, white except for its 
glass. Then his eyes were at- 
tracted by motion, by the 
parka-clad men hauling the 
surviving diver up on the ice. 
Other darkish figures were 
simply standing there, some of 
them beginning to point. 

Behind them was a smaller 
helicopter with the loop-shap- 
ed aerial of a radio location 
finder mounted atop its plastic 
dome. There was something 
wrong with the sky, and the 
Murderer realized it was not 
the sky. It was a vast white 
canvas dome, dimpling in the 
polar wind. The unnatural cir- 
cle in the ice and the equip- 
ment grouped around it all 
were hidden from aerial obser- 
vation. 

Pointing at him from the 
fuselage of the huge helicop- 
ter, and so close that his eyes 
had avoided it, was a metal 
boom with a hoist cable taut 
into the water, tethering 
something below the surface. 
Some of the men were running 
toward the huge helicopter 
now. In front of them at the 
edge of the ice lay shapeless 
bundles of what appeared to 
be black rubberized canvas, 
and he wondered fleetingly if 
these contained more of the 
soon-to-be gelatinous picket 
buoys. One of the figures was 
aiming something at him. As 
the Murderer let air out of the 
flotation tanks and swiftly 
sank, he realized it had not 
been a gun ; it had been a cam- 
era with a telephoto lens. 



127 




He passed the tubular shape 
on the end of the cable. It was 
an anti-submarine torpedo. 
When he sank deeper, he pass- 
ed a cylinder dangling from 
two black rubber-insulated 
cables. 

He valved compressed air 
back into the flotation tanks 
and came up under the ice, so 
hazardously close he had to 
duck his head as he steered a 
weaving course among the 
downward bulges of old Si- 
berian ice. Even though he 
had been deafened, he felt the 
sonar pulsing against the ice, 
searching for him. Then he 
felt it knocking against the 
minisub, pinging against his 
air tanks, thudding accusing- 
ly against his bones. It follow- 
ed him wherever he steered. 

He smiled blearily. This 
would be the ultimate if they 
unleashed the expensively in- 
tricate homing torpedo — at 
one man riding a cheap mini- 
sub constructed by a big- 
handed, happily singing petty 
officer on his own time. He 
hoped they would waste the 
torpedo on him. If he had to 
be destroyed by a gadget, an 
infernal machine, at least it 
was better to be killed as an 
individual rather than in a 
group so large he would be 
nameless in death. 

Abruptly the sonar left him. 
They must have decided he 
was not going to lead them 
back to his submarine. Now 
they were hurriedly ranging 
for it. 

128 



He cruised on and on with 
his dead cargo. 

Then he felt the echo of 
sonar from the submarine’s 
hull. He must be close. The 
helicopter, with its sonar sys- 
tem lowered into the water 
like a fisherman’s hook, had 
caught the Fleet Ballistic Mis- 
sile submarine. 

He could feel the subma- 
rine’s sonar searching franti- 
cally. They would be sounding 
for another submarine. He 
could imagine horror on the 
sonar men’s faces as they real- 
ized they couldn’t detect any- 
thing at the apparent source 
of the unidentified sonar that 
had caught them. 

The submarine’s sonar 
caught something — him. 

H E STEERED directly into 
it and found the subma- 
rine. Bow into the current, the 
gray undersea boat was still 
holding its position. The Mur- 
derer guessed the commander 
had decided that the best move 
was no move. 

Valving out air, he brought 
the minisub down, opened the 
outer hatch and dragged 
the minisub into the water- 
filled chamber. A great weari- 
ness had come over him and it 
was all he could do to lock the 
hatch. He knocked on the bulk- 
head, while the persistent so- 
nar pinging went on and on. 
Someone tapped very gently, 
although they might as well 
hammer with a wrench; it 
wouldn’t make any difference 

HAYDEN HOWARD 




now. The Murderer realized 
they were waiting for him to 
plug into the telephone socket 
and give his maximum depth 
and time spent there and other 
decompression data he hadn’t 
kept. They intended to decom- 
press him as if this were just 
another safe-and-sane train- 
ing exercise. 

In the chamber lights, Bar- 
ney’s rubber suit had sagged 
over the side of the minisub 
like a black rag doll. The Mur- 
derer averted his eyes and 
plugged in. 

“One — two — three — ” he 

said automatically. 

“Barney?” 

“Barney’s dead.” 

“This is the commander. 
There is a submarine out 
there. For some reason, we 
can’t locate it with our sonar. 
Have you seen it?” 

“Commander, it’s a helicop- 
ter. They have an anti-subma- 
rine torpedo in the water.” 

“I’m having difficulty read- 
ing you — ” 

“Helicopter. Anti-sub tor- 
pedo!” 

“Did they take any aggres- 
sive action against you?” 
“Depends on how you look 
at it. Their picket buoys are 
under here. Barney tried to 
recover one. It was booby- 
trapped to destroy itself.” 
“Barney?” the commander’s 
voice persisted. 

“I told you he’s dead ! I got 
one of their divers.” 

“One of their divers? He 
was attacking you?” 

MURDER BENEATH THE POLAR ICE 



“I killed him. He was trying 
to get away.” 

There was a long pause. 
Only the persistent knocking 
of the giant helicopter’s sonar 
reached the Murderer’s ear. 

When the commander spoke 
again, it was as if murder had 
been done. “Do they know?” 
“The other one looked back. 
Sure they know. They know.” 
“Then they may consider 
we’re the ones who’ve taken 
aggressive action,” the com- 
mander said slowly. “We’ll 
have to wait. If we move off, 
their commanding officers on 
the spot may feel committed to 
local retaliatory action. We’ll 
have to wait while they’re 
radioing for instructions. 
We’ll have to hope their side 
will decide to take this before 
an international court.” 

“Court ? What sort of court? 
A murder court?” 

“Let’s hope it’s only one 
murder,” the commander’s 
voice came through distantly, 
“and not one hundred million. 
We’ll have to sit it out.” 

As decompression began, 
the Murderer sank down be- 
side Barney’s body in the 
water-filled chamber. Super- 
imposed upon the command- 
er’s two little kids, swinging 
on their swings, he saw the 
surprised face of the diver — 
and even the little fish, lost 
from its school, and its won- 
drous eye — two billion years 
of evolution waiting for a ver- 
dict of life or death.
