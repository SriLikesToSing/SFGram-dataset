The only thing we know about tomorrow 
is that it has its roots today. And out of the 
fantastic facts of today's scientific wonders 
Galaxy's all-star lineup of contributors weave 
stories that are sometimes wry, sometimes ter- 
rifying— but always a delight to read. 

Would you like to join us, next issue and 
every issue thereafter for years to come, on

THIRTY LONG YEARS 


\ s you may have noted by the 
cover of this issue, we cele- 
brate our thirtieth anniversary in 
science fiction this month. That 
first sale wasn’t a story; it was a 
poem (and we would take it as 
a personal favor if no one ever 
looked it up); and calling this 
the thirtieth anniversary is at 
least approximately true. That is, 
the thing was published in Oc- 
tober, 1937, all right. But it was 
written in 1935 . accepted in 
1936 . and paid for in 1938, 
because that was how things were 
in the science-fiction field in 
those days. 

It seems to us that those days 
were quite a long time ago. No 
television to sell us what we don’t 
need. No nuclear weapons to 
keep us looking over our shoul- 
ders. No human beings in space; 
no jet aircraft; no Pill, no LSD. 
We used to correspond (with 
other science-fiction fans, of 
course) in England, and a one-up 
thing to do was to time one’s 
letter-writing so as to catch a 
fast Cunarder or the almost-as- 
fast Normandie; with luck, those 


thirty-knot liners could get a let- 
ter to its recipient across the 
ocean in five days. (Now we have 
five hundred and fifty knot air- 
craft, of course — and with luck 
we can get a letter across in four 
days.} 

One other thing that was very 
different in those days was that 
people didn’t ask us (as they do 
now; all the time, they do it) 
how in the world we were going 
to keep on writing science fiction, 
now that science itself had made 
so much of it come true. Au con- 
traire, as the French say. If the 
non-sf addicts ever noticed us at 
all, it was primarily to tell us 
how crazy we were, to be writing 
about things which could never 
ever come true, like the afore- 
mentioned TV, atomic weapons, 
space travel, et al. 

So how do we keep on writing 
science fiction? Why, we just 
write about the things that 
haven’t happened yet. And, as 
you will see from an examination 
of this magazine, that gives us 
plenty of scope, for a long time 
to come .... — THE EDITOR

THE TECHNICOLOr 
TIME MACHINE 

Harry Harrison. When you’ve 
got a movie studio, a script 
for a Viking epic, a star with 
the broadest measurements 
in Hollywood, and a time 
machine, what could be 
simpler than taking the 
whole crew back a thousand 
years to shoot the picture 
against a really authentic 
background? Well, for one 
thing, the return trip could 
be simpler. But it couldn't be 
funnier. $3.95 


PLANET RU1 

Keith Laumer and Gordon R. 
Dickson. At age 135, Captain 
Henry wants to retire. He’s 
opened up so many planets 
and taken so many rejuvena- 
tion treatments that he’s 
earned a rest. But powerful 
Senator Bartholomew won’t 
let him, not with a newly dis- 
covered planet to be staked 
out. So Henry goes, taking 
Bartholomew’s priggish son 
with him, thereby setting the 
space stage for a most bi- 
zarre "conflict of genera- 
tions." $3.95

DAMNATION 

ALLEY 

Come ride along Damnation Alley 
— hell's own highway, crossing 
the U.S.A. from coast to coast! 


by 



Illustrated by 
GAUGHAN 


/ T'he gull swooped by, seemed 
^ to hover a moment on un- 
moving wings. 

Hell Tanner flipped his cigar 
butt at it and scored a lucky 
hit. The bird uttered a hoarse 
cry and beat suddenly at the air. 


It climbed about fifty feet, and 
whether it shrieked a second time, 
he would never know. 

It was gone. 

A single gray feather rocked 
in the violet sky, drifted out over 
the edge of the cliff and descend- 
ed, swinging, toward the ocean. 
Tanner chuckled through his 


6 


beard, between the steady roar 
of the wind and the pounding 
of the surf. Then he took his feet 
down from the handlebars, kick- 
ed up the stand and gunned his 
bike to life. 

He took the slope slowly till he 
came to the trail, then picked up 
speed and was doing fifty when 
he hit the highway. 

He leaned forward and gunned 
it. He had the road all to hirn- 
self, and he laid on the gas pedal 
till there was no place left for it 
to go. He raised his goggles and 
looked at the world through 
crud-colored glasses, which was 
pretty much the way he looked 
at it without them, too. 

All the old irons were gone 
from his jacket, and he missed the 
swastika, the hammer and sickle 
and the upright finger, especially. 
He missed his old emblem, too. 
Maybe he could pick one up in 
Tijuana and have sbme broad 
sew it on and .... No. It wouldn’t 
do. All that was dead and gone. 
It would be a giveaway, and he 
wouldn’t last a day. What he 
would do was sell the Harley, 
work his way down the coast, 
clean and square and see what 
he could find in the other Ameri- 
ca. 

He coasted down one hill and 
roared up another. He tore 
through Laguna Beach, Capistra- 
no Beach, San Clemente and 
San Onofre. He made it down 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


to Oceanside, where he refueled, 
and he passed on through Carls- 
bad and all those dead little 
beaches that fill the shore space 
before Solana Beach Del Mar. 
It was outside San Diego that 
they were waiting for him. 

H e saw the roadblock and 
turned. They were not sure 
how he had managed it that 
quickly, at that speed. But now 
he was heading away from them. 
He heard the gunshots and kept 
going. Then he heard the sirens. 

He blew his horn twice in reply 
and leaned far forward. The 
Harley leaped ahead, and he won- 
dered whether they were radioing 
to someone further on up the 
line. 

He ran for ten minutes and 
couldn’t shake them. Then fif- 
teen. 

He topped another hill, and 
far ahead he saw the second 
block. He was bottled in. 

He looked all around him for 
side roads, saw none. 

Then he bore a straight course 
toward the second block. Might 
as well try to run it. 

No good! 

There were cars lined up 
across the entire road. They were 
even off the road on the shoul- 
ders. 

He braked at the last possible 
minute, and when his speed was 
right he reared up on the back 

7 


wheel, spun it and headed back 
toward his pursuers. 

There were six of them coming 
toward him, and at his back new 
siren calls arose. 

He braked again, pulled to the 
left, kicked the gas and leaped 
out of the seat. The bike kept 
going, and he hit the ground roll- 
ing, got to his feet and started 
running. 

He heard the screeching of 
their tires. He heard a crash. 
Then there were more gunshots, 
and he kept going. They were 
aiming over his head, but he 
didn’t know it. They wanted him 
alive. 

After fifteen minutes he was 
backed against a wall of rock, 
and they were fanned out in 
front of him, and several had 
rifles, and they were all pointed 
in the wrong direction. 

He dropped the tire iron he 
held and raised his hands. 

“You got it, citizens,” he said. 
“Take it away.” 

And they did. 

They handcuffed him and took 
him back to the cars. They push- 
ed him into the rear seat of one, 
and an officer got in on either 
side of him. Another got into 
the front beside the driver, and 
this one held a sawed-off shot- 
gun across his knees. 

The driver started the engine 
and put the car into gear, head- 
ing back up 101.

The man with the shotgun 
turned and stared through bifo- 
cals that made his eyes look like 
hourglasses filled with green sand 
as he lowered his head. He stared 
for perhaps ten seconds, then 
said, “That was a stupid thing 
to do.” 

T Tell Tanner stared back until 
the man said, “Very stupid, 
Tanner.” 

“Oh, I didn’t know you were 
talking to me.” 

“I’m looking at you, son.” 

“And I’m looking at you. Hel- 
lo, there.” 

Then the driver said, without 
taking his eyes off the road, “You 
know, it’s too bad we’ve got to 
deliver him in good shape — after 
the way he smashed up the other 
car with that damn bike.” 

“He could still have an acci- 
dent. Fall and crack a couple 
ribs, say,” said the man to Tan- 
ner’s left. 

The man to the right didn’t 
say anything, but the man with 
the shotgun shook his head slow- 
ly. “Not unless he tries to es- 
cape,” he said. “L.A. wants him 
in good shape. 

“Why’d you try to skip out, 
buddy? You might have known 
we’d pick you up.” 

Tanner shrugged. 

“Why’d you pick me up? I 
didn’t do anything?” 

The driver chuckled. 


GALAXY 


“That’s why,” he said. “You 
didn’t do anything, and there’s 
something you were supposed to 
do. Remember?” 

“I don’t owe anybody any- 
thing. They gave me a pardon 
and let me go.” 

“You got a lousy memory, 
kid. You made the nation of Cali- 
fornia a promise when they turn- 
ed you loose yesterday. Now 
you’ve had more than the tweny- 
four hours you asked for to settle 
your affairs. You can tell them 
‘no’ if you want and get your 
pardon revoked. Nobody’s forc- 
ing you. Then you can spend the 
rest of your life making little 
rocks out of big ones. We couldn’t 
care less. I heard they got some- 
body else lined up already.” 
“Give me a cigarette,” Tanner 
said. 

The man on his right lit one 
and passed it to him. 

He raised both hands, accepted 
it. As he smoked, he flicked the 
ashes onto the floor. 

They sped along the highway, 
and when they went through 
towns or encountered traffic the 
driver would hit the siren and 
overhead the red light would be- 
gin winking. When this occurred, 
the sirens of the two other patrol 
cars that followed behind them 
would also wail. The driver never 
touched the brake, all the way 
up to L.A., and he kept radioing 
ahead every few minutes. 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


There came a sound like a 
sonic boom, and a cloud of dust 
and gravel descended upon them 
like hail. A tiny crack appeared 
in the lower right-hand corner 
of the bullet-proof windshield, 
and stones the size of marbles 
bounced on the hood and the 
roof. The tires made a crunching 
noise as they passed over the 
gravel that now lay scattered up- 
on the road surface. The dust 
hung like a heavy fog, but ten 
seconds later they had passed 
out of it. 

The men in the car leaned 
forward and stared upward. 

rip he sky had become purple, 

! and black lines crossed it, 
moving from west to east. These 
swelled, narrowed, moved from 
side to side, sometimes merged. 
The driver had turned on his 
lights by then. 

“Could be a bad one coming,” 
said the man with the shotgun. 

The driver nodded, and, 
“Looks worse further north, 
too,” he said. 

A wailing began, high in the 
air above them, and the dark 
bands continued to widen. The 
sound increased in volume, lost 
its treble quality, became a 
steady roar. 

The bands consolidated, and 
the sky grew dark as a starless, 
moonless night and the dust fell 
about them in heavy clouds. Oc- 

9 


:asionally, there sounded a ping 
as a heavier fragment struck 
against the car. 

The driver switched on his 
country lights, hit the siren again 
and sped ahead. The roaring and 
the sound of the siren fought 
with one another above them, 
and far to the north a blue 
aurora began to spread, pulsing. 

Tanner finished his cigarette, 
and the man gave him another. 
They were all smoking by then. 

“You know, you’re lucky we 
picked you up, boy,” said the 
man to his left. “How’d you like 
to be pushing your bike through 
that stuff?” 

“I’d like it,” Tanner said. 

“You’re nuts.” 

“No. I’d make it. It wouldn’t 
be the first time.” 

By the time they reached Los 
Angeles, the blue aurora filled 
half the sky, and it was tinged 
with pink and shot through with 
smoky, yellow streaks that reach- 
ed like spider legs into the south. 
The roar was a deafening, physi- 
cal thing that beat upon their 
eardrums and caused their skin 
to tingle. As they left the car 
and crossed the parking lot, head- 
ing toward the big, pillared build- 
ing with the frieze across its fore- 
head, they had to shout at one 
another in order to be heard. 

“Lucky we got here when we 
did!” said the man with the shot- 
gun. “Step it up!” Their pace in- 
10 


creased as they moved toward 
the stairway, and, “It could break 
any minute now!” screamed the 
driver. 

II 

As they had pulled into the 
lot, the building had had the 
appearance of a piece of ice- 
sculpture, with the shifting lights 
in the sky playing upon its sur- 
faces and casting cold shadows. 
Now, though, it seemed as If it 
were a thing out of wax, ready 
to melt in an instant’s flash of 
heat. 

Their faces and the flesh of 
their hands took on a bloodless, 
corpse-like appearance. 

They hurried up the stairs, and 
a State Patrolman let them in 
through the small door to the 
right of the heavy metal double 
doors that were the main en- 
trance to the building. He locked 
and chained the door behind 
them, after snapping open his 
holster when he saw Tanner. 

“Which way?” asked the man 
with the shotgun. 

“Second floor,” said the troop- 
er, nodding toward a stairway to 
their right. “Go straight back 
when you get to the top. It’s the 
big office at the end of the hall.” 

“Thanks.” 

The roaring was considerably 
muffled, and objects achieved an 
appearance of natural existence 

GALAXY 


once more in the artificial light 
of the building. 

They climbed the curving stair- 
way and moved along the corri- 
dor that led back into the build- 
ing. When they reached the final 
office, the man with the shotgun 
nodded to his driver. “Knock,” 
he said. 

A woman opened the door, 
started to say something, then 
stopped and nodded when she 
saw Tanner. She stepped aside 
and held the door. “This way,” 
she said, and they moved past her 
into the office, and she pressed a 
button on her desk and told the 
voice that said, “Yes, Mrs. 
Fiske?” : “They’re here, with that 
man, sir.” 

“Send them in.” 

She led the to the dark, pan- 
eled door in the back of the room 
and opened it before them. 

They entered, and the husky 
man behind the glass-topped 
desk leaned backward in his chair 
and wove his short fingers to- 
gether in front of his chins and 
peered over them through eyes 
just a Shade darker than the gray 
of his hair. His voice was soft and 
rasped just slightly. “Have a 
seat.” he said to Tanner, and to 
the others, “Wait outside.” 

“You know this guy’s danger- 
ous, Mister Denton,” said the 
man with the shotgun as Tanner 
seated himself in a chair situ- 
ated five feet in front of the desk. 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


Steel shutters covered the 
room’s three windows, and 
though the men could not see 
outside they could guess at the 
possible furies that stalked there 
as a sound like machine-gun fire 
suddenly rang through the room. 

“I know.” 

“Well, he’s handcuffed, any- 
way. Do you want a gun?” 

“I’ve got one.” 

“Okay, then. We’ll be outside.” 

They left the room. 

r T''he two men stared at one an- 
1 -*■ other until the door closed, 
then the man called Denton 
said, “Are all your affairs settled 
now?” and the other shrugged. 
Then, “What the hell is your first 
name, really? Even the records 
show — ” 

“Hell,” said Tanner. “That’s 
my name. I was the seventh kid 
in our family, and when I was 
born the nurse held me up and 
said to my old man, ‘What name 
do you want on the birth certifi- 
cate?’ and 1 Dad said, ‘Hell!’ and 
walked away. So she put it down 
like that. That’s what my brother 
told me. I never saw my old man 
to ask if that’s how it was. He 
copped out the same day. Sounds 
right, though.” 

“So your mother raised all 
seven of you?” 

“No. She croaked a couple 
weeks later, and different rela- 
tives took us kids.” 

11 


“I see,” said Denton, “You’ve 
still got a choice, you know. Do 
you want to try it or don’t you?” 
“What’s your job, anyway?” 
asked Tanner. 

“I’m the Secretary of Traffic 
for the nation of California.” 
“What’s that got to do with it?” 
“I’m coordinating this thing. It 
could as easily have 'been the 
Surgeon General or the Postmas- 
ter General, but more of it really 
falls into my area of responsibili- 
ty. I know the hardware best. I 
know the odds — ” 

“What are the odds?” asked 
Tanner. 

For the first time, Denton 
dropped his eyes. 

“Well, it’s risky 
“Nobody’s ever done it before, 
except for that nut who ran it 
to bring the news, and he’s dead. 
How can you get odds out of 
that?” 

“I know,” said Denton slowly. 
“You’re thinking it’s a suicide 
job, and you’re probably right. 
We’re sending three cars, with 
two drivers in each. If any one 
just makes it close enough, its 
broadcast signals may serve to 
guide in a Boston driver. You 
don’t have to go though, you 
know.” 

“I know. I’m free to spend the 
rest of my life in prison.” 

“You killed three people. You 
could have gotten the death pen- 
alty.” 

12 


“I didn’t, so why talk about it? 
Look, mister, I don’t want to die 
and I don’t want the other bit 
either.” 

“Drive or don’t drive. Take 
your choice. But remember, if 
you drive and you make it, all 
will be forgiven and you can go 
your own way. The nation of 
California will even pay for that 
motorcycle you appropriated and 
smashed up, not to mention the 
damage to that police car.” 
“Thanks a lot,” and the winds 
boomed on the other side of the 
wall, and the steady staccato from 
the window shields filled the 
room. 

CiXTou’re a very good driver,” 
>- * said Denton, after a time. 
“You’ve driven just about every 
vehicle there is to drive. You’ve 
even raced. Back when you were 
smuggling, you used to make a 
monthly run to Salt Lake City. 
There are very few drivers who’ll 
try that, even today.” 

Hell Tanner smiled, remember- 
ing something. 

“. And in the only legitimate 
job you ever held, you were the 
only man who’d make the mail 
run to Albuquerque. There’ve 
only been a few others since you 
were fired.” 

“That wasn’t my fault.” 

“You were the best man on the 
Seattle run, too,” Denton con- 
tinued. “Your supervisor said so. 

GALAXY 


.What I’m trying to say is that, 
«*f anybody we could pick, you’ve 
probably got the best chance of 
getting through. That’s why 
we’ve been indulgent with you, 
tout we can’t afford to wait any 
longer. It’s yes or no right now, 
and you’ll leave within the hour 
if it’s yes.” 

Tanner raised his cuffed hands 
and gestured toward the window. 
“In all this crap?” he asked. 
“The cars can take this storm,” 
said Denton. 

“Man, you’re crazy.” 

“People are dying even while 
we’re talking,” said Denton. 

‘l So a few more ain’t about to 
ms|ke that much difference. Can’t 
we wait till tomorrow?” 

“No! A man gave his life to 
bring us the news! And we’ve got 
to get across the continent as 
fast as possible now or it won’t 
matter! Storm or no storm, the 
cars leave now! Your feelings on 
the matter don’t mean a good 
goddamn in the face of this! All 
I want out of you, Hell, is one 
word: Which one will it be?” 
“I’d like something to eat. I 
haven’t 

“There’s food in the car. 
What’s your answer?” 

Hell stared at the dark window. 
“Okay,” he said, “I’ll run 
Damnation Alley for you. I won’t 
leave without a piece of paper 
with some writing on it, though.” 
“I’ve got it here.” 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


Denton opened a drawer and 
withdrew a heavy cardboard en- 
velope from which he extracted 
a piece of stationery bearing the 
Great Seal of the nation of Cali- 
fornia. He stood and rounded fee 
desk and handed it to Hell Tan- 
ner. 

Hell studied it for several min- 
utes, then said, “This says that 
if I make it to Boston I receive 
a full pardon for every criminal 
action I’ve ever committed wife- 
in the nation of California . 

“That’s right.” 

“Does that include ones you 
might not know about now, if 
someone should come up with 
them later?” 

“That’s what it says, Hell — 
‘every criminal action.’ ” 

“Okay, you’re on, fat boy. Get 
these bracelets off me and show 
me my car.” 

r T' , he man called Denton moved 
' back to his seat on the other 
side of his desk. 

“Let me tell you something 
else, Hell,” he said. “If you try 
to cop out anywhere along fee 
route, the other drivers have their 
orders, and they’ve agreed to fol- 
low them. They will open fire on 
you and burn you into little bitty 
ashes. Get the picture?” 

“I get the picture,” said Hell. 
“I take it I’m supposed to da 
them the same favor?” 

“That is correct.”

“Good enough. That might be 
fun.” 

“I thought you’d like it.” 

“Now, if you’ll unhook me, 
I’ll make the scene for you.” 

“Not till I’ve told you what I 
think of you,” Denton said. 

“Okay, if you want to waste 
tame calling me names, while 
people are dying — ” 

“Shut up! You don’t care 
about them and you know it! I 
just want to tell you that I think 
you are the lowest, most repre- 
hensible human being I have ever 
encountered. You have killed 
men and raped women. You 
once gouged out a man’s eyes, 
just for fun. You’ve been indicted 
twice for pushing dope and three 
times as a pimp. You’re a drunk 
and a degenerate, and I don’t 
think you’ve had a bath since the 
day you were born. You and 
your hoodlums terrorized decent 
people when they were trying to 
pull their lives together after the 
war. You stole from them and 
you asaulted them, and you ex- 
torted money and the necessaries 
of life with the threat of physi- 
cal violence. I wish you had died 
in the Big Raid, that night, like 
all the rest of them. You are not 
a human being, except from a 
biological standpoint. You have 
a big dead spot somewhere inside 
you where other people have 
something that lets them live to- 
gether in society and be neigh- 
14 


bors. The only virtue that you 
possess — if you want to call it 
that -r* is that your reflexes may 
be a little faster, your muscles a 
little stronger, your eye a bit 
more wary than the rest of us, 
so that you can sit behind a 
wheel and drive through anything 
that has a way through it. It is 
for this that the nation of Cali- 
fornia is willing to pardon your 
inhumanity if you will use that 
one virtue to help rather than 
hurt. I don’t approve. I don’t 
want to depend on you, because 
you’re not the type. I’d like to 
see you die in this thing, and 
while I hope that somebody 
makes it through, I hope that it 
will be somebody else. I hate 
your bloody guts. You’ve got 
your pardon now. The car’s ready. 
Let’s go.” 

Denton stood, at a height of 
about five feet eight inches, and 
Tanner stood and looked down 
at him and chuckled. 

“I’ll make it,” he said. “If that 
citizen from Boston made it 
through and died, I’ll make it 
through and live. I’ve been as far 
as the Missus Hip.” 

“You’re lying.” 

“No, I ain’t either, and if you 
ever find out that’s straight, re- 
member I got this piece of paper 
in my pocket — ‘every criminal 
action’ and like that. It wasn’t 
easy, and I was lucky, too. But 
I made it that far and, nobody 

GALAXY 


else you know can say that. So I 
figure that’s about halfway, and 
I can make the other half if I 
can get that far.” 

They moved toward the door. 
“I don’t like to say it and mean 
it,” said Denton, “but good luck. 
Not for your sake, though.” 
“Yeah, I know.” 

Denton opened the door, and, 
“Turn him loose,” he said. “He’s 
driving.” 

The officer with the shotgun 
handed 1 it to the man who had 
given Tanner the cigarettes, and 
he fished in his pockets for the 
key. When he found it, he un- 
locked the cuffs, stepped back, 
and hung them at his belt; and, 
“I’ll come with you,” said Den- 
ton. “The motor pool is down- 
stairs.” 

They left the office, and Mrs. 
Fiske opened her purse and took 
a rosary into her hands and 
bowed her head. She prayed for 
Boston and she prayed for the 
soul of its departed messenger. 
She even threw in a couple for 
Hell Tanner. 

Ill 

^Tphey descended to the base- 
ment, the sub-basement and 
the sub-sub-basement. 

When they got there, Tanner 
saw three cars, ready to go; and 
he saw five men seated on bench- 
es along the wall. 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


One of them he recognized. 

“Denny,” he said, “come here,” 
and he moved forward, and a 
slim, blond youth who held a 
crash helmet in his right hand 
stood and walked toward him. 

“What the hell are you doing?” 
he asked him. 

“I’m second driver in car 
three.” 

“You’ve got your own garage 
and you’ve kept your nose clean. 
What’s the thought on this?” 
“Denton offered me fifty 
grand,” said Denny, and Hell 
turned away his face. 

“Forget it! It’s no good if 
you’re dead!” 

“I need the money.” 

“Why?” 

“I want to get married and I 
can use it.” 

“I thought you were making 
out okay.” 

“I am, but I’d like to buy a 
house.” 

“Does your girl know what 
you’ve got in mind?” 

“No.” 

“I didn’t think so. Listen, I’ve 
got to do it — it’s the only way 
out for me. You don’t have to — ” 
“That’s for me to say.” 

“ — so I’m going to tell you 
something: You drive out to 
Pasadena to that place where we 
used to play when we were kids 
— with the rocks and the three 
big trees — you know where I 
mean?” 

15 


“Yeah, I sure do remember.” 
“Go back of the big tree in 
the middle, on the side where I 
carved my initials. Step off seven 
steps and dig down around four 
feet. Got that?” 

“Yeah. What’s there?” 

“That’s my legacy, Denny. 
You’ll find one of those old strong 
boxes, probably all rusted out 
by now. Bust it open. It’ll be full 
of excelsior, and there’ll be a six- 
inch joint of pipe inside. It’s 
threaded, and there’s caps on 
both ends. There’s a little over 
five grand rolled up inside it, and 
all the bills are clean.” 

“Why you telling me this?” 
“Because it’s yours now,” he 
said, and hit him in the jaw. 


When Denny fell, he kicked 
him in the ribs, three times, be- 
fore the cops grabbed him and 
dragged him away. 

U\7'ou fool!” said Denton as 
they held him. “You crazy, 
damned fool!” 

“Uh-uh,” said Tanner. “No 
brother of mine is going to run 
Damnation Alley while I’m 
around to stomp him and keep 
him out of the game. Better find 
another driver quick, because he’s 
got cracked ribs. Or else let me 
drive alone.” 

“Then you’ll drive alone,” said 
Denton, “because we can’t afford 
to wait around any longer. 
There’s pills in the compartment, 



16 


GALAXY 


to keep you awake, and you’d 
better use them, because if you 
fall back they’ll bum you up. 
Remember that.” 

“I won’t forget you, mister, if 
I’m ever back in town. Don’t 
fret about that.” 

‘‘Then you’d better get into car 
number two and start heading 
up the ramp. The vehicles are 
all loaded. The cargo compart- 
ment is under the rear seat.” 
“Yeah, I know.” 

“. And if I ever see you 
again, it’ll be too soon. Get out of 
my sight, scum!” 

Tanner spat on the floor and 
turned his back on the Secretary 
of Traffic. Several cops were 
giving first aid to his brother, and 


one had dashed off in search of a 
doctor. Denton made two teams 
of the remaining four drivers and 
assigned them to cars one and 
three. Tanner climbed into the 
cab of his own, started the engine 
and waited. He stared up the 
ramp and considered what lay 
ahead. He searched the compart- 
ments until he found cigarettes. 
He lit one and leaned back. 

The other drivers moved for- 
ward and mounted their own 
heavily shielded vehicles. The 
radio crackled, crackled, hummed, 
crackled again, and then a voice 
came through as he heard the 
other engines come to life. 

“Car one — ready!” came the 
voice. 



DAMNATION ALLEY 


17 


There was a pause, then, “Car 
three — ready!” said a different 
voice. 

Tanner lifted the microphone 
and mashed the button on its side. 
“Car two ready,” he said. 
“Move out,” came the order, 
and they headed up the ramp. 

The door rolled upward be- 
fore them, and they entered the 
storm. 

IV 

I t was nightmare, getting out of 
L.A. and onto Route 91. The 
waters came down in sheets and 
rocks the size of baseballs banged 
against the armor plating of his 
car. Tanner smoked and turned 
on the special lights. He wore in- 
frared goggles, and the night and 
the storm stalked him. 

The radio crackled, many 
times, and it seemed that he 
heard the murmur of a distant 
voice, but he could never quite 
make out what it was trying to 
say. 

They followed the road for as 
far as it went, and as their big 
tires sighed over the rugged ter- 
rain that began where the road 
ended, Tanner took the lead and 
the others were content to fol- 
low. He knew the way; they 
didn’t. 

He followed the old smug- 
glers’ route he’d used to run 
candy to the Mormons. It was 

18 


possible that he was the only 
one left alive that knew it. Pos- 
sible, but then there was always 
someone looking for a fast buck. 
So, in all of L.A., there might be 
somebody else. 

The lightning began to fall, 
not in bolts, but sheets. The car 
was insulated, but after a time his 
hair stood on end. He might 
have seen a giant Gila Monster 
once, but he couldn’t be sure. 
He kept his fingers away from 
the fire-control board. He’d save 
his teeth till menaces were im- 
minent. From the rearview scan- 
ners it seemed that one of the 
cars behind him had discharged 
a rocket, but he couldn’t be sure, 
since he had lost all radio con- 
tact with them immediately up- 
on leaving the building. 

Waters rushed toward him, 
splashed about his car. The sky 
sounded like an artillery range. 
A boulder the size of a tombstone 
fell in front of him, and he 
swerved about it. Red lights 
flashed across the sky from north 
to south. In their passing, he de- 
tected many black bands going 
from west to east. It was not an 
encouraging spectacle. The storm 
could go on for days. 

He continued to move forward, 
skirting a pocket of radiation that 
had not died in the four years 
since last he had come this way. 

They came upon a place where 
the sands were fused into a glas- 

GALAXY 


sy sea, and he slowed as he be- 
gan its passage, peering ahead 
after the craters and chasms it 
contained. 

Three more rockfalls assailed 
him before the heavens split 
themselves open and revealed a 
'bright blue light, edged with vio- 
let. The dark curtains rolled back 
toward the Poles, and the roaring 
and the gunfire reports dim- 
inished. A lavender glow remain- 
ed in the north, and a green 
sun dipped toward the horizon. 

'Tphey had ridden it out. He 
-*■ killed the infras, pushed back 
his goggles and switched on the 
normal night lamps. 

The desert would be bad 
enough, all by itself. 

Something big and bat-like 
swooped through the tunnel of 
his lights and was gone. He 
ignored its passage. Five minutes 
later it made a second pass, this 
time much closer, and he fired 
a magnesium flare. A black 
shape, perhaps forty feet across, 
was illuminated, and he gave it 
two five-second bursts from the 
fifty-calibers and it fell to the 
ground and did not return again. 

To the squares, this was Dam- 
nation Alley. To Hell Tanner, 
this was still the parking lot. He’d 
been this way thirty-two times, 
and so far as he was concerned 
the Alley started in the place 
that was once called Colorado. 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


He led, and they followed, and 
the night wore on like an abra- 
sive. 

No airplane could make it. Not 
since the war. None could ven- 
ture above a couple hundred feet, 
the place where the winds began. 
The winds. The mighty winds 
that circled the globe, tearing off 
the tops of mountains, Sequoia 
trees, wrecked buildings, gather- 
ing up birds, bats, insects and 
anything else that moved, up into 
the dead belt; the winds that 
swirled about the world, lacing 
the skies with dark lines of de- 
bris, occasionally meeting, merg- 
ing, clashing, dropping tons of 
carnage wherever they came to- 
gether and formed too great a 
mass. Air transportation was 
definitely out, to anywhere in the 
world. For these winds circled, 
and they never ceased. Not in all 
the twenty-five years of Tanner’s 
memory had they let up. 

Tanner pushed ahead, cutting 
a diagonal by the green sunset. 
Dust continued to fall about him, 
great clouds of it, and the sky 
was violet, then purple once 
more. Then the sun went down 
and the night came on, and the 
stars were very faint points of 
light somewhere above it all. 
After a time, the moon rose, and 
the half-face that it showed that 
night was the color of a glass of 
chianti wine held before a can- 
dle.

He lit another cigarette and 
began to curse, slowly, softly and 
without emotion. 

f | ,; hey threaded their way amid 
1 heaps of rubble: rock, metal, 
fragments of machinery, the prow 
of a boat. A snake, as big around 
as a garbage can and dark green 
in the cast light, slithered across 
Tanner’s path, and he braked the 
vehicle as it continued and con- 
tinued and continued. Perhaps a 
hundred and twenty feet of snake 
passed by before Tanner remov- 
ed his foot from the brake and 
touched gently upon the gas 
pedal once again. 

Glancing at the left-hand 
screen, which held an infrared 
version of the view to the left, 
it seemed that he saw two eyes 
glowing within the shadow of a 
heap of girders and masonry. 
Tanner kept one hand near the 
fire-control button and did not 
move it for a distance of several 
miles. 

There were no windows in the 
vehicle, only screens Which re- 
flected views in every direction 
including straight up and the 
ground beneath the car. Tanner 
sat within an illuminated box 
which shielded him against radi- 
ation. The “car” that he drove 
had eight heavily treaded tires 
and was thirty-two feet in length. 
It mounted eight fifty-caliber au- 
tomatic guns and four grenade 
20 


throwers. It carried thirty armor- 
piercing rockets which could be 
discharged straight ahead or at 
any elevation up to forty degrees 
from the plane. Each of the four 
sides, as well as the roof of the 
vehicle, housed a flame thrower. 
Razor-sharp “wings” of temper- 
ed steel — eighteen inches wide 
at their bases and tapering to 
points, an inch and a quarter 
thick where they ridged — could 
be moved through a complete 
hundred-eighty-degree arc along 
the sides of the car and parallel 
to the ground, at a height of two 
feet and eight inches. When 
standing at a right angle to the 
body of the vehicle — eight feet 
to the rear of the front bumper 
— they extended out to a dis- 
tance of six feet on either side 
of the car. They could be couch- 
ed like lances for a charge. They 
could be held but slightly out 
from the sides for purposes of 
slashing whatever was sideswiped. 
The car was bullet-proof, air- 
conditioned and had its own food 
locker and sanitation facilities. A 
long-barreled .357 Magnum was 
held by a clip on the door near 
the driver’s left hand. A 30.06, a 
.45 caliber automatic and six 
hand grenades occupied the rack 
immediately above the front seat. 

But Tanner kept his own 
counsel, in the form of a long, 
slim SS dagger inside his right 
boot. 


GALAXY 


IT e removed his gloves and 

^ wiped his palms on the knees 
of his denims. The pierced heart 
that was tattooed on the back of 
his right hand was red in the 
light from the dashboard. The 
knife that went through it was 
dark blue, and his first name was 
tattooed in the same color be- 
neath it, one letter on each 
knuckle, beginning with that at 
the base of his little finger. 

He opened and explored the 
two near compartments but ,tould 
find no cigars. So he crushed out 
his cigarette butt on the floor 
and lit another. 

The forward screen showed 
vegetation, and he slowed. He 
tried using the radio but couldn’t 
tell whether anyone heard him, 
receiving only static in reply. 

He slowed, staring ahead and 
up. He halted once again. 

He turned his forward lights up 
to full intensity and studied the 
situation. 

A heavy wall of thorn bushes 
stood before him, reaching to a 
height of perhaps twelve feet. 
It swept on to his right and off to 
his left, vanishing out of sight in 
both directions. How dense, how 
deep a pit might be, he could not 
tell. It had not been there a few 
years before. 

He moved forward slowly and 
activated the flame throwers. In 
the rearview screen, he could 
see that the other vehicles had 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


halted a hundred yards behind 
him and dimmed their lights. 

He drove till he could go no 
further, then pressed the button 
for the forward flame. 

It shot forth, a tongue of fire, 
licking fifty feet into the bramble. 
He held it for five seconds and 
withdrew it. Then he extended 
it a second time and backed 
away quickly as the flames 
caught. 

Beginning with a tiny glow, 
they worked their way upward 
and spread slowly to the right 
and the left. Then they grew in 
size and brightness. 

As Tanner backed away, he 
had to dim his screen, for they’d 
spread fifty feet before he’d 
backed more than a hundred, 
and they leapt thirty and forty 
feet into the air. 

The blaze widened, to a hun- 
dred feet, two, three .... As 
Tanner backed away, he could 
see a river of fire flowing off into 
the distance, and the night was 
bright about him. 

He watched it burn, until it 
seemed that he looked upon a 
molten sea. Then he searched the 
refrigerator, but there was no 
beer. He opened a soft drink and 
sipped it while he watched the 
burning. After about ten minutes, 
the air conditioner whined and 
shook itself to life. Hordes of 
dark, four-footed creatures, the 
size of rats or cats, fled from the 

21 


inferno, their coats smouldering. 
They flowed by. At one point, 
they covered his forward screen, 
and he could hear the scratching 
of their claws upon the fenders 
and the roof. 

He switched off the lights and 
killed the engine, tossed the 
empty can into the waste box. He 
pushed the “Recline” button on 
the side of the seat, leaned back, 
and closed his eyes. 

V 

T T e was awakened by the blow- 
ing of horns. It was still 
night, and the panel clock 
showed him that he had slept for 
a little over three hours. 

He stretched, sat up, adjusted 
the seat. The other cars had 
moved up, and one stood to 
either side of him. He leaned on 
his own horn twice and started 
his engine. He switched on the 
forward lights and considered the 
prospect before him as he drew 
on his gloves. 

Smoke still rose from the 
blackened field, and far off to his 
right there was a glow, as if the 
fire still continued somewhere in 
the distance. They were in the 
place that had once been known 
as Nevada. 

He rubbed his eyes and 
scratched his nose, then blew the 
horn once and engaged the gears. 

He moved forward slowly. The 

22 


bumt-out area seemed fairly level 
and his tires were thick. 

He entered the black field, and 
his screens were immediately ob- 
scured by the rush of ashes and 
smoke which arose on all sides. 

He continued, hearing the tires 
crunching through the brittle re- 
mains. He set his screens at maxi- 
mum and switched his headlamps 
up to full brightness. 

The vehicles that flanked him 
dropped back perhaps eighty 
feet, and he dimmed the screens 
that reflected the glare of their 
lights. 

He released a flare, and as it 
hung there, burning, cold, white 
and high, he saw a charred plain 
that swept on to the edges of his 
eyes’ horizon. 

He pushed down on the ac- 
celerator, and the cars behind him 
swung far out to the sides to 
avoid the clouds that he raised. 
His radio crackled, and he heard 
a faint voice but could not make 
out its words. 

He blew his horn and rolled 
ahead even faster. The other ve- 
hicles kept pace. 

He drove for an hour and a 
half before he saw the end of the 
ash and the beginning of clean 
sand up ahead. 

Within five minutes, he was 
moving across desert once more, 
and he checked his compass and 
bore slightly to the west. Cars 
one and three followed, speeding 

GALAXY 


up to match his new pace, and 
he drove with one hand and ate a 
corned beef sandwich. 

\TT7lien morning came, many 
* ' hours later, he took a pill 
to keep himself alert and listened 
to the screaming of the wind. 
The sun rose up like molten silver 
to his right, and a third of the sky 
grew amber and was laced with 
fine lines like cobwebs. The de- 
sert was topaz beneath it, and the 
brown curtain of dust that hung 
continuously at his back, pierced 
only by the eight shafts of the 
other cars’ lights, took on a pink- 
ish tone as the sun grew a bright 
red corona and the shadows fled 
into the west. He dimmed his 
lights as lie passed an orange 
cactus shaped like a toadstool 
and perhaps fifty feet in diameter. 

Giant bats fled south, and far 
ahead he saw a wide waterfall 
descending from the heavens. It 
was gone by the time he reached 
the damp sand of that place, but 
a dead shark lay to his left, and 
there was seaweed, seaweed, sea- 
weed, fishes, driftwood all about. 

The sky pinked over from east 
to west and remained that color. 
He gulped a bottle of ice water 
and felt it go into his stomach. 
He passed more cacti, and a pair 
of coyotes sat at the base of one 
and watched him drive by. They 
seemed to be laughing. Their 
tongues were very red. 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


As the sun brightened, hS 
dimmed the screen. He smoked, 
and he found a button that pro- 
duced music. He swore at the 
soft, stringy sounds that filled the 
cabin, but he didn’t turn them 
off. 

He checked the radiation level 
outside, and it was only a little 
above normal. The last time he 
had passed this way, it had been 
considerably higher. 

He passed several wrecked ve- 
hicles such as his own. He ran 
across another plain of silicon, 
and in the middle was a huge 
crater Which he skirted. The 
pinkness in the sky faded and 
faded and faded, and a bluish 
tone came to replace it. The dark 
lines were still there, and oc- 
casionally one widened into a 
black river as it flowed away into 
the east. At noon, one such river 
partly eclipsed the sun for a 
period of eleven minutes. With 
its departure, there came a brief 
dust storm, and Tanner turned 
on the radar and his lights. He 
knew there was a chasm some- 
where ahead, and when he came 
to it he bore to the left and ran 
along its edge for close to two 
miles before it narrowed and van- 
ished. The other vehicles follow- 
ed, and Tanner took his bearings 
from the compass once more. The 
dust had subsided with the brief 
wind, and even with the screen 
dimmed Tanner had to don his 

23 


dark goggles against the glare of 
reflected sunlight from the 
faceted field he now negotiated. 

He passed towering formations 
Which seemed to be quartz. He 
had never stopped to investigate 
them in the past, and he had no 
desire to do it now. The spectrum 
danced at their bases, and patch- 
es of sudh light occurred for some 
distance about them. 

Speeding away from the crater, 
he came again upon sand, clean, 
brown, white dun and red. There 
were more cacti, and huge dunes 
lay all about him. The sky con- 
tinued to change, until finally it 
was as blue as a baby’s eyes. 
Tanner hummed along with the 
music for a time, and then he saw 
the Monster. 

I t was a Gila, bigger than his 
car, and it moved in fast. It 
sprang from out the sheltering 
shade of a valley filled with cacti 
and it raced toward him, its bead- 
ed body bright with many colors 
beneath the sun, its dark, dark 
eyes unblinking as it bounded 
forward on its lizard-fast legs, 
sable fountains rising behind its 
upheld tail that was wide as a 
sail and pointed like a tent. 

He couldn’t use the rockets be- 
cause it was coming in from the 
side. 

He opened up with his fifty- 
calibers and spread his “wings” 
and stamped the accelerator to 
24 


the floor. As it neared, he sent 
forth a cloud of fire in its direc- 
tion. By then, the other cars were 
firing, too. 

It swung its tail and opened 
and closed its jaws, and its blood 
came forth and fell upon the 
ground. Then a rocket struck it. 
It turned; it leaped. 

There came a booming, crunch- 
ing sound as it fell upon the ve- 
hicle identified as car number 
one and lay there. 

Tanner hit the brakes, turned, 
and headed back. 

Car number three came up be- 
side it and parked. Tanner did 
the same. 

He jumped down from the cab 
and crossed to the smashed car. 
He had the rifle in his hands and 
he put six rounds into the crea- 
ture’s head before he approached 
the car. 

The door Had come open, and 
it hung from a single hinge, the 
bottom one. 

Inside, Tanner could see the 
two men sprawled, and there was 
some blood upon the dashboard 
and the seat. 

The other two drivers came up 
beside him and stared within. 
Then the shorter of the two 
crawled inside and listened for 
the heartbeat and the pulse and 
felt for breathing. 

“Mike’s dead,” he called out, 
“but Greg’s starting to come 
around.” 


GALAXY 


A wet spot that began at the 
car’s rear and spread and contin- 
ued to spread, and the smell of 
gasoline filled the air. 

Tanner took out a cigarette, 
thought better of it and replaced 
it in the pack. He could hear the 
gurgle of the huge gas tanks as 
they emptied themselves upon 
the ground. 

The man who stood at Tan- 
ner’s side said, “I never saw any- 
thing like it ... I’ve seen pic- 
tures, but — I never saw any- 
thing like it . .” 

“I have,” said Tanner, and then 
the other driver emerged from 
the wreck, partly supporting the 
man he’d referred to as Greg. 

The man called out, “Greg’s all 
right. He just hit his head on the 
dash.” 

'T'he man who stood at Tanner’s 
1 -®- side said, “You can take 
him, Hell. He can back you up 
when he’s feeling better,” and 
Tanner shrugged and turned his 
back on the scene and lit a ciga- 
- rette. 

“I don’t think you should do 
— - ” the man began, and Tanner 
blew smoke in his face. He turn- 
ed to regard the two approach- 
ing men and saw that Greg was 
dark-eyed and deeply tanned. 
Part Indian, possibly. His skin 
seemed smooth, save for a couple 
pockmarks beneath his right eye, 
and his cheekbones were high and 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


his hair very dark. He was as big 
as Tanner, which was six-two, 
though not quite so heavy. He 
was dressed in overalls; and hig 
carriage, now that he had had a 
few deep breaths of air, became 
very erect, and he moved with a 
quick, graceful stride. 

“We’ll have to bury Mike,” 
the short man said. 

“I hate to lose the time,” said 
his companion, “but — ” and 
then Tanner flipped his cigarette 
and threw himself to the ground 
as it landed in the pool at the 
rear of the car. 

There was an explosion, flames, 
then more explosions. Tanner 
heard the rockets as they tore 
off toward the east, inscribing 
dark furrows in the hot after- 
noon’s air. The ammo for the 
fifty-calibers exploded, and the 
hand grenades went off, and Tan- 
ner burrowed deeper and deeper 
into the sand, covering his head 
and blocking his ears. 

As soon as things grew quiet, 
he grabbed for the rifle. But they 
were already coming at him, and 
he saw the muzzle of a pistol. He 
raised his hands slowly and stood. 

“Why the goddamn hell did 
you do a stupid tiling like that?” 
said the other driver, the man 
who held the pistol. 

Tanner smiled, and, “Now we 
don’t have to bury him,” he said. 
“Cremation’s just as good, and 
it’s already over.”

“You could have killed us all, 
if those guns or those rocket 
launchers had been aimed this 
wayl” 

“They weren’t. I looked.” 

“The flying metal could’ve — 
Oh .... I see. Pick up your damn 
rifle, buddy, and keep it pointed 
at the ground. Eject the rounds 
it’s still got in it and put ’em in 
your pocket.” 

Tanner did this thing while 
the other talked. 

“You wanted to kill us all, 
didn’t you? Then you could have 
cut out and gone your way, like 
you tried to do yesterday. Isn’t 
that right?” 

“You said it, mister, not me.” 

“It’s true, though. You don’t 
give a good goddamn if every- 
body in Boston croaks, do you?” 

“My gun’s unloaded now,” said 
Tanner. 

“Then get back in your bloody 
buggy and get going! I’ll be be- 
hind you all the way!” 

Tanner walked back toward his, 
car. He heard the others arguing 
behind him, but he didn’t think 
they’d shoot him. As he was 
about to climb up into the cab, 
he saw a shadow out of the comer 
of his eye and turned quickly. 

The man named Greg was 
standing behind him, tall and 
quiet as a ghost. 

“Want me to drive awhile?” 
he asked Tanner, without expres- 
sion. 

26 


“No, you rest up. I’m still in 
good shape. Later on this after- 
noon, maybe, if you feel up to 
it.” 

The man nodded and rounded 
the cab. He entered from the 
other side and immediately re- 
clined his chair. 

Tanner slammed his door and 
started the engine. He heard the 
air conditioner come to life. 

“Want to reload this?” he ask- 
ed. “And put it back on the 
rack?” And he handed the rifle 
and the ammo to the other, who 
had nodded. He drew on his 
gloves then and said, “There’s 
plenty of soft drinks in the ’frig. 
Nothing much else, though,” and 
the other nodded again. Then he 
heard car three start and said, 
“Might as well roll,” and he put 
it into gear and took his foot off 
the clutch. 

VI 

Fa fter they had driven for about 
half an hour, the man called 
Greg said to him, “Is it true what 
Marlowe said?” 

“What’s a Marlowe?” 

“He’s driving the other car. 
Were you trying to kill us? Do 
you really want to skip out?” 
Hell laughed, then, “That’s 
right,” he said. “You named it.” 
“Why?” 

Hell let it hang there for 
a minute, then said, “Why 

GALAXY 


shouldn’t I? I’m not anxious to 
die. I’d like to wait a long time 
before I try that bit.” 

Greg said, “If we don’t make 
it, the population of the conti- 
nent may be cut in half.” 

“If it’s a question of them or 
me, I’d rather it was them.” 

“I sometimes wonder how peo- 
ple like you happen.” 

“The same way as anybody 
else, mister, and it’s fun for a 
couple people for awhile, and 
then the trouble starts.” 

“What did they ever do to you, 
Hell?” 

“Nothing. What did they ever 
do for me? Nothing. Nothing. 
What do I owe them? The same.” 
“Why’d you stomp your 
brother back at the Hall?” 
“Because I didn’t want him 
doing a damfool thing like this 
and getting himself killed. Crack- 
ed ribs he can get over. Death 
is a more permanent ailment.” 
“That’s not what I asked you. 
I mean, what do you care 
whether he croaks?” 

“He’s a good kid, that’s why. 
He’s got a thing for this chick, 
though, and he can’t see straight.” 
“So what’s it to you?” 

“Like I said, he’s my brother 
and he’s a good kid. I like him.” 
“How come?” 

“Oh, hell! We’ve been through 
a lot together, that’s all! What 
are you trying to do? Psycho- 
analyze me?” 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


“I was just curious, that’s all.” 
“So now you know. Talk about 
something else if you want to 
talk, okay?” 

C6/'\kay. You’ve been this way 
before, right?” 

“That’s right.” 

“You been any further east?” 
“I’ve been all the way to the 
Missus Hip.” 

“Do you know a way to get 
across it?” 

“I think so. The bridge is still 
up at Saint Louis.” 

“Why didn’t you go across it 
the last time you were there?” 
“Are you kidding? The thing’s 
packed with cars full of bones. 
It wasn’t worth the trouble to 
try and clear it.” 

“Why’d you go that far in the 
first place?” 

“Just to see what it was like. 
I heard all these stories — ” 
“What was it like?” 

“A lot of crap. Burnt down 
towns, big craters, crazy animals, 
some people — ” 

“People? People still live 
there?” 

“If you want to call them that. 
They’re all wild and screwed up. 
They wear rags or animal skins 
or they go naked. They threw 
rocks at me till I shot a couple. 
Then they let me alone.” 

“How long ago was that?” 

“Six — maybe seven years ago. 
I was just a kid then.” 

27 


“How come you never told any- 
body about it?” 

“I did. A coupla my friends. 
Nobody else ever asked me. We 
were going to go out there and 
grab off a couple of the girls 
and bring them back, but every- 
body chickened out.” 

“Wihat would you have done 
with them?” 

Tanner shrugged. “I dunno. 
Sell ’em, I guess.” 

“You guys used to do that, 
down on the Barbary Coast — 
sell people, I mean — didn’t 
you?” 

Tanner shrugged again. 

“Used to,” he said, “before the 
Big Raid.” 

“How’d you manage to live 
through that? I thought they’d 
cleaned the whole place out?” 

“I was doing time,” he said. 
“A.D.W.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Assault with a deadly weap- 
on.” 

“What’d you do after they let 
you go?” 

“I let them rehabilitate me. 
They got me a job running the 
mail.” 

“Oh yeah, I heard about that. 
Didn’t realize it was you, though. 
You were supposed to be pretty 
good — doing all right and ready 
for a promotion. Then you kicked 
your boss around and lost your 
job. How come?” 

“He was always riding me 

28 


about my record and about my 
old gang down on the Coast. Fi- 
nally, one day I told him to lay 
off, and he laughed at me, so I 
hit him with a chain. Knocked 
out the bastard’s front teeth. I’d 
do it again.” 

“Too bad.” 

“I was the best driver he had. 
It was his loss. Nobody else will 
make the Albuquerque run, not 
even today. Not unless they real- 
ly need the money.” 

“Did you like the work, 
though, while you were doing it?” 
“Yeah, I like to drive.” 

“You should probably have 
asked for a transfer when the guy 
started bugging you.” 

“I know. If it was happening 
today, that’s probably what I’d 
do. I was mad, though, and I 
used to get mad a lot faster than 
I do now. I think I’m smarter 
these days than I was before.” 

“If you make it on this run 
and you go home afterwards, 
you’ll probably be able to get 
your job back. Think you’d take 
it?” 

“In the first place,” said Tan- 
ner, “I don’t think we’ll make 
it. And in the second, if we do 
make it and there’s still people 
around that town, I think I’d 
rather stay there than go back.” 

reg nodded. “ ‘Might be 
smart. You’d be a hero. No- 
body’d know much about your 

GALAXY 


record. Somebody’d turn you on 
to something good.” 

“The hell with heroes,” said 
Tanner. 

“Me, though, I’ll go back if we 
make it.” 

“Sail ’round Cape Horn?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Might be fun. But why go 
back?” 

“I’ve got an old mother and a 
mess of brothers and sisters I 
take care of, and I’ve got a girl 
back there.” 

Tanner brightened the screen 
as the sky began to darken. 

“What’s your mother like?” 

“Nice old lady. Raised the 
eight of us. Got arthritis bad 
now, though.” 

“What was she like when you 
were a kid?” 

“She used to work during the 
day, but she cooked our meals 
and sometimes brought us candy. 
She made a lot of our clothes. 
She used to tell us stories, like 
about how things were before the 
war. She played games with us 
and sometimes she gave us toys.” 

“How about your old man?” 
Tanner asked him, after awhile. 

“He drank pretty heavy and 
he had a lot of jobs, but he never 
beat us too much. He was all 
right. He got run over by a car 
when I was around twelve.” 

“And you take care of every- 
body now?” 

“Yeah. I’m the oldest.” 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


“What is it that you do?” 
“I’ve got your old job. I run 
the mail to Albuquerque.” 

“Are you kidding?” 

“No.” 

“I’ll be damned! Is Gorman 
still the supervisor?” 

“He retired last year, on dis- 
ability.” 

“I’ll be damned! That’s funny. 
Listen, down in Albuquerque do 
you ever go to a bar called Pe- 
dro’s?” 

“I’ve been there.” 

“Have they still got a little 
blonde girl plays the piano? 
Named Margaret?” 

“No.” 

“Oh.” 

“They’ve got some guy now. 
Fat fellow. Wears a big ring on 
his left hand.” 

Tanner nodded and downshift- 
ed as he began the ascent of a 
steep hill. 

“How’s your head now?” he 
asked, when they’d reached the 
top and started down the oppo- 
site slope. 

“Feels pretty good. I took a 
couple of your aspirins with that 
soda I had.” 

“Feel up to driving for 
awhile?” 

“Sure, I could do that.” 
“Okay, then.” Tanner leaned 
on the horn and braked the car. 
“Just follow the compass for a 
hundred miles or so and wake me 
up. All right?” 

29 


“Okay. Anything special I 
should watch out for?” 

“The snakes. You’ll probably 
see a few. Don’t hit them, what- 
ever you do.” 

“Right.” 

They changed seats, and Tan- 
ner reclined the one, lit a cig- 
arette, smoked half of it, crushed 
it out and went to sleep. 

VII 

XT Then Greg awakened him, it 
’ ' was night. Tanner coughed 
and drank a mouthful of ice 
water and crawled back to the 
latrine. When he emerged, he 
took the driver’s seat and check- 
ed the mileage and looked at the 
compass. He corrected their 
course and, “We’ll be in Salt 
Lake City before morning,” he 
said, “if we’re lucky. — Did you 
run into any trouble?” 

“No, it was pretty easy. I saw 
some snakes and I let them go 
by. That was about it.” 

Tanner grunted and engaged 
the gears. 

“What was that guy’s name 
that brought the news about the 
plague?” Tanner asked. 

“Brady or Brody or something 
like that,” said Greg. 

“What was it that killed him? 
He might have brought the 
plague to L.A., you know.” 

Greg shook his head. 

“No. His car had been dam- 
30 


aged, and he was all broken up — 
and he’d been exposed to radi- 
ation a lot of the way. They burnt 
his body and his car, and any- 
body who’d been anywhere near 
him got shots of Haffikine.” 
“What’s that?” 

“That’s the stuff we’re carry- 
ing — Haffikine antiserum. It’s 
the only cure for the plague. 
Since we had a bout of it around 
twenty years ago, we’ve kept it 
on hand and maintained the facil- 
ities for making more in a hurry. 
Boston never did, and now 
they’re hurting.” 

“Seems kind of silly for the 
only other nation on the conti- 
nent — maybe in the world — 
not to take better care of itself, 
when they knew we’d had a dose 
of it.” 

Greg shrugged. 

“Probably, but there it is. Did 
they give you any shots before 
they released you?” 

“Yeah.” 

“That’s what it was, then.” 

“I wonder where their driver 
crossed the Missus Hip? He 
didn’t say, did he?” 

“He hardly said anything at 
all. They got most of the story 
from the letter he carried.” 
“Must have been one hell of a 
driver, to run the Alley.” 

“Yeah. Nobody’s ever done it 
before, have they?” 

“Not that I know of.” 

“I’d like to have met the guy.” 
GALAXY 


“Me too, at least I guess.” 
“It’s a shame we can’t radio 
across country, like in the old 
days.” 

“Why?” 

“Then he wouldn’t of had to 
do it, and -we could find out 
along the way whether it’s real- 
ly worth making the run. They 
might all be dead by now, you 
know.” 

“You’ve got a point there, mis- 
ter, and in a day or so we’ll be 
to a place where going back will 
be harder than going ahead.” 
Tanner adjusted the screen as 
dark shapes passed. 

“Look at that, will you!” 

“I don’t see anything.” 

“Put on your infras.” 

/'"''reg did this and stared up- 
ward at the screen. 

Bats. Enormous bats cavorted 
overhead, swept by in dark 
clouds. 

“There must be hundreds of 
them, maybe thousands . 

“Guess so. Seems there are 
more than there used to be when 
I came this way a few years 
back. They must be screwing 
their heads off in Carlsbad.” 

“We never see them in L.A. 
Maybe they’re pretty much 
harmless.” 

“Last time I was up to Salt 
Lake, I heard talk that a lot of 
them were rabid. Some day some- 
one’s got to go — them or us.” 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


“You’re a cheerful guy to ride 
with, you know?” 

Tanner chuckled and lit a 
cigarette, and, “Why don’t you 
make us some coffee?” he said. 
“As for the bats, that’s something 
our kids can worry about, if there 
are any.” 

Greg filled the coffee pot and 
plugged it into the dashboard. 
After a time, it began to grum- 
ble and hiss. 

“What the hell’s that?” said 
Tanner, and he hit the brakes. 
The other car halted, several hun- 
dred yards behind his own, and 
he turned on his microphone and 
said, “Car three! What’s that 
look like to you?” and waited. 

He watched them: toweling, 
tapered tops that spun between 
the ground and the sky, wobbling 
from side to side, sweeping back 
and forth, about a mile ahead. 
It seemed there were fourteen or 
fifteen of the things. Now they 
stood like pillars, now they 
danced. They bored into the 
ground and sucked up yellow 
dust. There was a haze all about 
them. The stars were dim or ab- 
sent above or behind them. 

Greg stared ahead and said, 
“I’ve heard of whirlwinds, torna- 
does — big, spinning things. I’ve 
never seen one, but that’s the 
way they were described to me.” 

And then the radio crackled, 
and the muffled voice of the man 
called Marlowe came through: 

31 


“Giant dust devils,” he said. 
“Big, rotary sand storms. I think 
they’re sucking stuff up into the 
dead belt, because I don’t see 
anything coming down — ” 
“You ever see one before?” 
“No, but my partner says he 
did. He says the best thing might 
be to shoot our anchoring 
columns and stay put.” 

npanner did not answer imme- 
1 *■“ diately. He stared ahead, 
and the tornadoes seemed to grow 
larger. 

“They’re coming this way,” he 
finally said. “I’m not about to 
park here and be a target. I want 
to be able to maneuver. I’m go- 
ing ahead through them.” 

“I don’t think you should.” 
“Nobody asked you, mister, 
but if you’ve got any brains 
you’ll do the same thing.” 

“I’ve got rockets aimed at your 
tail, Hell.” 

“You won’t fire them — not 
for a thing like this, where I 
could be right and you could be 
wrong — and not with Greg in 
here, too.” 

There was silence within the 
static, then, “Okay, you win, 
Hell. Go ahead, and we’ll watch. 
If you make it, we’ll follow. If 
you don’t, we’ll stay put.” 

“I’ll shoot a flare when I get 
to the other side,” Tanner said. 
“When you see it, you do the 
same. Okay?” 

32 


Tanner broke the connection 
and looked ahead, studying the 
great black columns, swollen at 
their tops. There fell a few layers 
of light from the storm which 
they supported, and the air was 
foggy between the blacknesses of 
their revolving trunks. “Here 
goes,” said Tanner, switching his 
lights as bright as they would 
beam. “Strap yourself in, boy,” 
and Greg obeyed him as the ve- 
hicle crunched forward. 

Tanner buckled his own safety 
belt as they slowly edged ahead. 

The columns grew and swayed 
as he advanced, and he could 
now hear a rushing, singing 
sound, as of a chorus of the winds. 

He skirted the first by three 
hundred yards and continued to 
the left to avoid the one which 
stood before him and grew and 
grew. As he got by it, there was 
another, and he moved further to 
the left. Then there was an open 
area of perhaps a quarter of a 
mile leading ahead and toward 
his right. 

He swiftly sped across it and 
passed between two of the 
towers that stood like ebony pil- 
lars a hundred yards apart. As 
he passed them, the wheel was 
almost tom from his grip, and he 
seemed to inhabit the center of 
an eternal thunderclap. He swerv- 
ed to the right then and skirted 
another, speeding. 

Then he saw seven more and 

GALAXY 


cut between two and passed about 
another. As he did, the one be- 
hind him moved rapidly, cross- 
ing the path he had just taken. 
He exhaled heavily and turned 
to the left. 

He was surrounded by the final 
four, and he braked so that he 
was thrown forward and the 
straps cut into his shoulder, as 
two of the whirlwinds shook 
yiolently and moved in terrible 
Spurts of speed. One passed be- 
fore him, and the front end of his 
car was raised from off the 
ground. 

Then he floored the gas pedal 
and Shot between the final two, 
and they were all behind him. 

He continued on for about a 
quarter for a mile, turned the car 
about, mounted a small rise and 
parked. 

He relased the flare. 

It hovered, like a dying star, 
for about half a minute. 

He lit a cigarette as he stared 
back, and he waited. 

He finished the cigarette. 

Then, “Nothing,” he said. 
“Maybe they couldn’t spot it 
through the storm. Or maybe we 
couldn’t see theirs.” 

“I hope so,” said Greg. 

“How long do you want t6 
wait?” 

“Let’s have that coffee.” 

A n hour passed, then two. The 
pillars began to collapse un- 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


til there were only three of the 
slimmer ones. They moved off 
toward the east and were gone 
from sight. 

Tanner released another flare, 
and still there was no response. 

“We’d better go back and look 
for them,” said Greg. 

“Okay.” 

And they did. 

There was nothing there, 
though, nothing to indicate the 
fate of car three. 

Dawn occurred in the east be- 
fore they had finished with their 
searching, and Tanner turned die 
car around, checked the compass, 
and moved north. 

“When do you think we’ll hit 
Salt Lake?” Greg asked him, 
after a long silence. 

“Maybe two hours.” 

“Were you scared, back when 
you ran those things?” 

“No. Afterwards, though, I 
didn’t feel so good.” 

Greg nodded. 

“You want me to drive again?” 
“No. I won’t be able to sleep 
if I stop now. We’ll take in more 
gas in Salt Lake, and we can get 
something to eat while a mechan- 
ic checks over the car. Then I’ll 
put us on the right road, and you 
can take over while I sack out.” 
The sky was purple again and 
the black bands had widened. 
Tanner cursed and drove faster. 
He fired his ventral flame at two 
bats who decided to survey the 

33 


car. They fell back, and lie ac- 
cented the mug of coffee Greg of- 
fered him. 

VIII 

Hpfae sky was as dark as evening 
when they pulled into Salt 
Lake City. John Brady — that 
was his name — • had passed that 
way but days before, and the city 
was ready for the responding ve- 
hicle. Most of its ten thousand 
inhabitants appeared along the 
street, and before Hell and Greg 
had jumped down from the cab 
after pulling into the first garage 
they saw, the hood of car number 
two was opened and three me- 
chanics were peering at the en- 
gine. 

They abandoned the idea of 
eating in the little diner across 
the street. Too many people hit 
them with too many questions as 
soon as they set foot outside the 
garage. They retreated and sent 
someone after eggs, bacon and 
toast. 

There was cheering as they 
rolled forth onto the street and 
sped away into the east. 

“Could have used a beer,” said 
Tanner. “Damn it!” 

And they rushed along beside 
the remains of what had once 
been U.S. Route 40. 

Tanner relinquished the driv- 
er’s seat and stretched out on 
the passenger side of the cab. 
34 


The sky continued to darken 
above them, taking upon it the 
appearance it had had in L.A. 
the day before. 

“Maybe we can outrun it,” 
Greg said. 

“Hope so.” 

The blue pulse began in the 
north, flared into a brilliant auro- 
ra. The sky was almost black di- 
rectly overhead. 

“Run!” cried Tanner. “Run! 
Those are hills up ahead! Maybe 
we can find an overhang or a 
cave!” 

But it broke upon them before 
they reached the hills. First came 
the hail, then the flak. The big 
stones followed, and the scanner 
on the right went dead. The 
sands blasted them, and they 
rode beneath a celestial waterfall 
that caused the engine to sputter 
and cough. 

They reached the shelter of 
the hills, though, and found a 
place within a rocky valley where 
the walls jutted steeply forward 
and broke the main force of 
the wind/ sand/dust/rock/water 
storm. They sat there as the 
winds screamed and boomed 
about them. They smoked and 
they listened. 

“We won’t make it,” said 
Greg. “You were right. I thought 
we had a chance. We don’t. 
Everything’s against us, even the 
weather.” 

“We’ve got a chance,” said 
GALAXY 


Tanner. “Maybe not a real good 
one. But we’ve been lucky so 
far. Remember that.” 

Greg spat into the waste con- 
tainer. 

“Why the sudden optimism? 
From you?” 

“I was mad before and shoot- 
ing off my mouth. Well, I’m still 
mad — ■ but I got me a feeling 
now: I feel lucky. That’s all.” 
Greg laughed. “The hell with 
luck. Look out there,” he said. 

“I see it,” said. Tanner. “This 
buggy is built to take it, and it’s 
doing it. Also, we’re only getting 
about ten per cent of its full 
strength.” 

“Okay, but , what difference 
does it make? It could last for a 
couple days.” 

“So we wait it out.” 

“Wait too long, and even that 
ten per cent can smash us. Wait 
too long, and even if it doesn’t 
there’ll be no reason left to go 
ahead. Try driving, though, and 
it’ll flatten us.” 

“It’ll take me ten or fifteen 
minutes to finish that scanner. 
We’ve got spare ‘eyes.’ If the 
storm lasts more than six hours, 
we’ll start out anyway.” 

“Says who?” 

“Me.” 

“Why? You’re the one who was 
so hot on saving his own neck. 
How come all of a sudden you’re 
willing to risk it, not to mention 
mine too?” 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


'T t anner smoked awhile, then 
said, “I’ve been thinking,” 
and then he didn’t say anything 
else. 

“About what?” Greg asked him. 
“Those folks in Boston,” Tan- 
ner said. “Maybe it is worth it. 
I don’t know. They never did 
anything for me. But hell, I like 
action and I’d hate to see the 
whole world get dead. I think I’d 
like to see Boston, too, just to 
see what it’s like. It might even 
be fun being a hero, just to see 
what that’s like. Don’t get me 
wrong. I don’t give a damn about 
anybody up there. It’s just that I 
don’t like the idea of everything 
being like, the Alley here — all 
burnt-out and screwed up and 
full of crap. When we lost the 
other car back in those tornadoes, 
it made me start thinking .... 
I’d hate to see everybody go 
that way — everything. I might 
still cop out if I get a real good 
chance, but I’m just telling you 
how I feel now. That’s all.” 

Greg looked away and laughed, 
a little more heartily than usual. 

“I never suspected you con- 
tained such philosophic depths.” 
“Me neither. I’m tired. Tell 
me about your brothers and sis- 
ters, huh?” 

“Okay.” 

Four hours later when the 
storm slackened 1 and the rocks 
became dust and the rain fog, 
Tanner replaced the right scan- 

35 


ner; and they moved on out, 
passing later through Rocky 
Mountain National Park. The 
dust and the fog combined to 
limit visibility throughout the 
day. That evening they skirted 
the ruin that was Denver, and 
Tanner took over as they headed 
toward the place that had once 
been called Kansas. 

He drove all night, and in the 
morning the sky was clearer than 
it had been in days. He let Greg 
snore on and sorted through his 
thoughts while he sipped his cof- 
fee. 

I t was a strange feeling that 
came over him as' he sat there 
with his pardon in his pocket and 
his hands upon the wheel. The 
dust fumed at his back. The sky 
was the color of rosebuds, and the 
dark trails had shrunken once 
again. He recalled the stories of 
the days when the missiles came 
down, burning everything but the 
northeast and the southwest; the 
day when the winds arose and 
the clouds vanished and the sky 
had lost its blue; the days when 
the Panama Canal had been 
shattered and radios had ceased 
to function; the days when the 
planes could no longer fly. He 
regretted this, for he had always 
wanted to fly, 'high, birdlike, 
swooping and' soaring. He felt 
slightly cold, and the screens now 
seemed to possess a crystal clari- 
36 


ty, like pools of tinted water. 
Somewhere ahead, far, far ahead 
lay what might be the only other 
sizeable pocket of humanity that 
remained on the shoulders of the 
world. He might be able to save 
it, if he could reach it in time. 
He looked about him at the rocks 
and the sand and the side of a 
broken garage that had some- 
how come to occupy the slope 
of a mountain. It remained with- 
in his mind long after he had 
passed it. Shattered, fallen down, 
half covered with debris, it took 
on a stark and monstrous form, 
like a decaying skull which had 
once occupied the shoulders of 
a giant; and he pressed down 
hard on the accelerator, although 
it could go no further. He be- 
gan to tremble. The sky bright- 
ened, but he did not touch the 
screen controls. Why did he have 
to be the one? He saw a mass 
of smoke ahead and to the right. 
As he drew nearer, he saw that 
it rose from a mountain which 
had lost its top and now held a 
nest of fires in its place. He cut 
to the left, going miles, many 
miles, out of the way he had in- 
tended. Occasionally, the ground 
shook beneath his wheels. Ashes 
fell about him, but now the 
smouldering cone was far to the 
rear of the right-hand screen. He 
wondered after the days that had 
gone before and the few things 
that he actually knew about them. 

GALAXY 


If he made it through, he de- 
cided he’d learn more about his- 
tory. He threaded his way 
through painted canyons and 
forded a shallow river. Nobody 
had ever asked him to do any- 
thing important before, and he 
hoped that nobody ever would 
again. Now, though, he was taken 
by the feeling that he could do 
it. He wanted to do it. Damna- 
tion Alley lay all about him, 
burning, fuming, shaking, and if 
he could not run it then half the 
world would die, and the chances 
wpuld be doubled that one day 
all the world would be part of the 
Alley. His tattoo stood stark on 
his whitened knuckles, saying 
“Hell,” and he knew that it was 
true. Greg still slept, the sleep 
of exhaustion, and Tanner nar- 
rowed his eyes and chewed his 
beard and never touched the 
brake, not even when he saw the 
rockslide beginning. He made it 
by and sighed. That pass was 
closed to him forever, but he had 
ishot through without a scratch. 
His mind was an expanding bub- 
ble, its surfaces like die view- 
screens, registering everything 
about him. He felt the flow of 
the air within the cab and the 
upward pressure of the pedal up- 
on his foot. His throat seemed 
dry, but it didn’t matter. His eyes 
felt gooey at their inside cor- 
ners, but he didn’t wipe them. He 
roared across the pocked plains 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


of Kansas, and he knew now that 
he had been sucked into the role 
completely and that he wanted it 
that way. Damn-his-eyes Denton 
had been right. It had to be done. 
He halted when he came to the 
lip of a chasm and headed north. 
Thirty miles later it ended, and 
he turned again to the south. 
Greg muttered in his sleep. It 
sounded like a curse. Tanner re- 
peated it softly a couple times 
and turned toward the east as 
soon as a level stretch occurred. 
The sun stood in high heaven, 
and Tanner felt as though he were 
drifting bodiless beneath it, 
above the brown ground flaked 
with green spikes of growth. He 
clenched his teeth and his mind 
went back to Denny, doubtless 
now in a hospital. Better than 
being where the others had gone. 
He hoped the money he’d told 
him about was still there. Then 
he felt the ache begin, in the 
places between his neck and his 
Shoulders. It spread down into 
his arms, and he realized how 
tightly he was gripping the wheel. 
He blinked and took a deep 
breath and realized that his eye- 
balls hurt. He lit a cigarette and 
it tasted foul, but he kept puffing 
at it. He drank some water and 
he dimmed the rear view-screen 
as the sun fell behind him. Then 
he heard a sound like a distant 
rumble of thunder and was fully 
alert once more. He sat up 

37 


straight and took his foot off the 
accelerator. 

He slowed. He braked and 
stopped. Then he saw them. He 
sat there and watched them as 
they passed, about a half-mile 
ahead. 

A monstrous herd of bison 
crossed before him. It took 
the better part of an hour before 
they had passed’. Huge, heavy, 
dark, heads down, hooves scoring 
the soil, they ran without slow- 
ing until the thunder was great 
and then rolled off toward the 
north, diminishing, softening, dy- 
ing, gone. The screen of their 
dust still hung before him, and 
he plunged into it, turning on his 
lights. 

He considered taking a pill, de- 
cided against it. Greg might be 
waking soon, he wanted to be 
able to get some sleep after they’d 
switched over. 

He came up beside a highway, 
and its surface looked pretty 
good, so he crossed onto it and 
sped ahead. After a time, he 
passed a faded, sagging sign that 
said “TOPEKA — 110 MILES.” 

Greg yawned and stretched. He 
rubbed his eyes with his knuck- 
les and then rubbed his fore- 
head, the right side of which was 
swollen and dark. 

“What time is it?” he asked. 

Tanner gestured toward the 
clock in the dashboard. 

38 


“Morning or is it afternoon?” 

“Afternoon.” 

“My God! I must have slept 
around fifteen hours!” 

“That’s about right.” 

“You been driving all that 
time?” 

“That’s right.” 

“You must be done in. You 
look like hell. Let me just hit 
the head. I’ll take over in a few 
minutes.” 

“Good idea.” 

Greg crawled toward die rear 
of the vehicle. 

After about five minutes, Tan- 
ner came upon the outskirts of a 
dead town. He drove up the main 
street, and there were rusted-out 
hulks of cars all along it. Most 
of die building had fallen in 
upon themselves, and some of the 
opened cellars that he saw were 
filled with scummy water. Skele- 
tons lay about the town square. 
There were no trees standing 
above the weeds that grew there. 
Three telephone poles still stood, 
one of them leaning forward and 
trailing wires like a handful of 
black spaghetti. Several benches 
were visible within the weeds 
beside the cracked sidewalks, and 
a skeleton lay stretched out upon 
the second one Tanner passed. 
He found his way barred by a 
fallen telephone pole, and he de- 
toured around the block. The 
next street was somewhat bet- 
ter preserved, but all its store- 

GALAXY 


front windows were broken, and 
a nude mannikin posed fetch- 
ingly with her left arm missing 
from the elbow down. The traf- 
fic light at the corner stared 
blindly as Tanner passed through 
its intersection. 

Tanner heard Greg coming 
forward as he turned at the next 
corner. 

“I’ll take over now,” he said. 

“I want to get out of this place 
first,” and they both watched in 
silence for the next fifteen min- 
utes until the dead town was 
gone from around them. 

Tanner pulled to a halt then 
and said, “We’re a couple hours 
away from a place that used to 
be called Topeka. Wake me if 
you run into anything hairy.” 

“How did it go while I was 
asleep? Did you have any trou- 
ble?” 

“No,” said Tanner, and he 
closed his eyes and began to 
snore. 

Greg drove away from the sun- 
set, and he ate three ham sand- 
wiches and drank a quart of milk 
before Topeka. 

IX 

PT i anner was awakened by the 
1 firing of the rockets. He rub- 
bed the sleep from his eyes and 
stared dumbly ahead for almost 
half a minute. 

Like gigantic dried leaves, 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


great clouds fell about them. 
Bats, bats, bats. The air was 
. filled with bats. Tanner could 
hear a chittering, squeaking, 
scratching sound, and the car was 
buffeted by their dark bodies. 

“Where are we?” he asked. 

“Kansas City. The place seems 
full of them,” and Greg released 
another rocket, which cut a fiery 
path through the swooping, 
spinning horde. 

“Save the rockets. Use the 
fire,” said Tanner, switching the 
nearest gup; to manual and bring- 
ing cross-hairs into focus upon 
the screen. “Blast ’em in all di- 
rections — for five, six seconds 
— then I’ll come in.” 

The flame shot forth, orange 
and cream blossoms of combus- 
tion. When they folded, Tanner 
sighted in the screen and squeez- 
ed the trigger. He swung the 
gun, and they fell. Their charred 
bodies lay all about him, and he 
added new ones to the smoulder- 
ing heaps. 

“Roll it!” he cried, and the car 
moved forward, swaying, bat- 
bodies crunching beneath its tires. 

Tanner laced the heavens with 
gunfire, and when they swooped 
again he strafed them and fired 
a flare. 

In the sudden magnesium 
glow from overhead, it seemed 
that millions of vampire-faced 
forms were circling, spiraling 
down toward them. 

39 


He switched from gun to gun, 
and they fell about him like 
fruit. Then he called out, “Brake, 
and hit the topside flame!” 
and Greg did this thing. 

“Now the sides! Front and rear 
next!” 

Bodies were burning all about 
them, heaped as high as the 
tiobd, and Greg put the car into 
low gear when Tanner cried 
“Forward!” And they pushed 
their way through the wall of 
charred flesh. 

Tanner fired another flare. 

The bats were still there, but 
circling higher now. Tanner 
primed the guns and waited, but 
they did not attack again in any 
great number. A few swept about 
them, and he took pot-shots at 
them as they passed. 

Ten minutes later he said, 
“That’s the Missouri River to 
our left. If we just follow along- 
side it now, we’ll hit Saint Louis.” 

“I know. Do you think it’ll be 
full of bats, too?” 

“Probably. But if we take our 
time and arrive with daylight, 
they shouldn’t bother us. Then 
we can figure a way to get across 
the Missus Hip.” 

Then their eyes fell upon the 
rearview screen, where the dark 
skyline of Kansas City with bats 
was silhouetted by pale stars and 
touched by the light of the bloody 
moon. 

After a time, Tanner slept once 

40 


more. He dreamt he was riding 
his bike, slowly, down the center 
of a wide street, and 'people lined 
the sidewalks and began to cheer 
as he passed. They threw con- 
fetti, but by the time it reached 
him it was garbage, wet and 
stinking. He stepped on the gas 
then, but his bike slowed even 
more and now they were scream- 
ing at him. They shouted ob- 
scenities. They cried out his 
name, over and' over, and again. 
The Harley began to wobble, but 
his feet seemed to be glued in 
place* In a moment, he knew, he 
would fall. The bike came to a 
halt then, and he began to topple 
over toward the right side. They 
rushed toward him as he fell, and 
he knew it was just about all 
over .... 

He awoke with a jolt and saw 
the morning spread out before 
him: a bright coin in the middle 
of a dark blue tablecloth and a 
row of glasses along the edge. 

“That’s it,” said Greg. “The 
Missus Hip.” 

Tanner was suddenly very 
hungry. 

A fter they had refreshed them- 
selves, they sought the 
bridge. 

“I didn’t see any of your naked 
people with spears,” said Greg. 
“Of course, we might have passed 
their way after dark — if there 
are any of them still around.” 

GALAXY 


“Good thing, too,” said Tan- 
ner. “Saved us some ammo.” 

The bridge came into view, 
sagging and dark save for the 
places where the sun gilded its 
cables, and it stretched un- 
broken across the bright expanse 
of waters. They moved slowly to- 
ward it, threading their way 
through streets gorged with rub- 
ble, detouring When it became 
completely blocked by the rows 
of broken machines, fallen walls, 
sewer-deep abysses in the burst 
pavement. 

It took them two hours to 
travel half a mile, and if was noon 
before they reached the foot of 
the bridge, and, “It looks as if 
Brady might have crossed here,” 
said Greg, eying what appeared 
to be a cleared passageway 
amidst the wrecks that filled the 
span. “How do you think he did 
it?” 

“Maybe he had something 
with him to hoist them and swing 
them out over the edge. There 
are some wrecks below, down 
where the water is shallow.” 

“Were they there last time 
you passed by?” 

“I don’t know. I wasn’t right 
down here by the bridge. I top- 
ped that hill back there,” and he 
gestured at the rearview screen. 

“Well, from here it looks like 
we might be able to make it. 
Let’s roll.” 

They moved upward and for- 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


ward onto the bridge and began 
their slow passage across the 
mighty Missus Hip. There were 
times when the bridge creaked be- 
neath them, sighed, groaned, and 
they felt it move. 

The sun began to climb, and 
still they moved forward, scrap- 
ing their fenders against the edges 
of the wrecks, using their wings 
like plows. They were on the 
bridge for three hours before its 
end came into sight through a rift 
in the junfcstacks. 

When their wheels finally 
touched the opposite shore, Greg 
sat there breathing heavily and 
then lit a cigarette. 

“You want to drive awhile, 
Hell?” 

“Yeah. Let’s switch over.” 

He did, and, “God! I’m 
bushed!” he said as he sprawled 
out. 

Tanner drove forward through 
the ruins of East Saint Louis, 
hurrying to clear the town before 
nightfall. The radiation level be- 
gan to mount as he advanced, 
and the streets were cluttered 
and broken. He checked the in- 
side of the cab for radioactivity, 
but it was still clean. 

It took him hours, and as the 
sun fell at his back he saw the 
blue aurora begin once more in 
the north. But the sky stayed 
clear, filled with its stars, and 
there were no black lines that he 
could see. After a long while, a 

41 


rose-cojored moon appeared and 
hung before him. He turned on 
the music, softly, and glanced at 
Greg. It didn’t seem to bother 
him, so he let it continue. 

The instrument panel caught 
his eye. The radiation level was 
still climbing. Then, in the for- 
ward screen, he saw the crater 
and he stopped. 

I t must have been over half a 
mile across, and he couldn’t 
tell its depth. 

He fired a flare, and in its light 
he used the telescopic lenses to 
examine it to the right and to 
the left. 

The way seemed smoother to 
the right, and he turned in that 
direction and began to negotiate 
it. 

The place was hot! So very, 
very hot! He hurried. And he 
wondered as he sped, the gauge 
rising before him: What had it 
been like on that day, Whenever? 
That day when a tiny sun had 
lain upon this spot and fought 
with, and for a time beaten, the 
brightness of the other in the 
sky, before it sank slowly into its 
sudden burrow? He tried to im- 
agine it, succeeded, then tried to 
put it out of his mind and 
couldn’t. How do you put out the 
fires that bum forever? He 
wished that he knew. There’d 
been so many places to go then, 
and he liked to move around. 

42 


What had it been like in the 
old days, when a man could just 
jump on his bike and cut out for 
a new town whenever he wanted? 
And nobody emptying buckets of 
crap on you from out of the sky? 
He felt cheated, which was not a 
new feeling for him, but it made 
him curse even longer than 
usual. 

He lit a cigarette when he’d 
finally rounded the crater, and he 
smiled for the first time in 
months as the radiation gauge 
began to fall once more. Before 
many miles, he saw tall grasses 
swaying about him, and not too 
long after that he began to see 
trees. 

Trees short and twisted, at 
first, but the further he fled from 
the place of carnage, the taller 
and straighter they became. They 
were trees such as he had never 
seen before — fifty, sixty feet in 
height — and graceful, and gath- 
ering stars, there on the plains 
of Illinois. 

He was moving along a dean, 
hard, wide road, and just then he 
wanted to travel it forever — to 
Floridee, of the swamps and 
Spanish moss and ritrus groves 
and fine beaches and the Gulf; 
and up to the cold, rocky Cape, 
where everything is gray and 
brown and the waves break be- 
low the lighthouses and the salt 
bums in your nose and there are 
graveyards where bones have 

GALAXY 


lain for centuries and you can 
still read the names they bore, 
chiseled there into the stones 
above them; down through the 
nation where they say the grass is 
blue; then follow the mighty 
Missus Hip to the place where 
she spreads and comes and 
there’s the Gulf again, full of 
little islands where the old 
boosters stashed their loot; and 
through the shag-topped moun- 
tains he’d heard about: the 

Smokies, Ozarks, Poconos, Cat- 
skills; drive through the forest 
of Shenandoah; park, and take a 
boat out over Chesapeake Bay; 
see the big lakes and the place 
where the water falls, Niagara. 
To drive forever along the big 
road, to see everything, to eat 
the world. Yes. Maybe it wasn’t 
all Damnation Alley. Some of 
the legendary places must still be 
clean, like the countryside about 
him now. He wanted it with a 
hunger, with a fire like that 
which always burned in his loins. 
He laughed then, just one short, 
sharp bark, because now it 
seemed like maybe he could have 
it. 

The music played softly, too 
sweetly perhaps, and it filled 
him. 

X 

T>y morning he was into the 
place called Indiana and 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


still following the road. He 
passed farmhouses which seemed 
in good repair. There could even 
be people living in them. He 
longed to investigate, but he 
didn’t dare to stop. Then after 
an hour, it was all countryside 
again, and degenerating. 

The grasses grew shorter, 
shriveled, were gone. An occas- 
ional twisted tree clung to the 
bare earth. The radiation level 
began to rise once more. The 
signs told him he was nearing 
Indianapolis, which he guessed 
was a big city that bad received 
a bomb and was now gone away. 

Nor was he mistaken. 

He had to detour far to the 
south to get around it, back- 
tracking to a place called Mar- 
tinsville in order to cross over 
the White River. Then as he 
headed east once more, his radio 
crackled and came to Hfe. There 
was a faint voice, repeating, 
“Unidentified vehicle, halt!” and 
he switched all the scanners to 
telescopic range. Far ahead, on a 
hilltop, he saw a standing man 
with binoculars and a walkie- 
talkie. He did not acknowledge 
receipt of the transmission, but 
kept driving. 

He was hitting forty miles an 
hour along a halfway decent sec- 
tion of roadway, and he gradual- 
ly increased his speed to fifty- 
five, though the protesting of his 
tires upon the cracked pavement 

43 


was sufficient to awaken Greg. 

Tanner stared ahead, ready for 
an attack, and the radio kept re- 
peating the order, louder now as 
he neared the hill, and called up- 
on him to acknowledge the mes- 
sage. 

He touched the brake as he 
rounded a long curve, and he did 
not reply to Greg’s “What’s the 
matter?” 

When he saw it there, blocking 
the way, ready to fire, he acted 
instantly. 

The tank filled the road, and 
its big gun was pointed directly 
at him. 

As his eye sought for and found 
passage around it, his right hand 
slapped the switches that sent 
three armor-piercing rockets 
screaming ahead and his left 
spun the wheel counter-clockwise 
and his foot fell heavy on the ac- 
celerator. 

He was half off the road then, 
bouncing along the ditch at its 
side, when the tank discharged 
one fiery belch which missed him 
and then caved in upon itself and 
blossomed. 

There came the sound of rifle 
fire as he pulled back onto the 
road on the other side of the tank 
and sped ahead. Greg launched 
a single grenade to the right and 
the left and then hit the fifty 
calibers. They tore on ahead, 
and after about a quarter of a 
mile Tanner picked up his mi- 
44 


crophone and said, “Sony about 
that. My brakes don’t work,” and 
hung it Up again. There was no 
response. 

\ s soon as they reached a level 
plain, commanding a good 
view in all directions, Tanner 
halted the vehicle and Greg 
moved into the driver’s seat. 

“Where do you think they got 
hold of that armor?” 

“Who knows?” 

“And why stop us?” 

“They didn’t know what we 
were carrying — and maybe they 
just wanted the car:” 

“Blasting, it’s a helluva way to 
get it.” 

“If they can’t have it, why 
should they let us keep it?” 

“You know just how they 
think, don’t you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Have a cigarette.” 

Tanner nodded, accepted. 

“It’s been pretty bad, you 
know?” 

“I can’t argue with that.” 

“ . And we’ve still got a long 
way to go.” 

“Yeah, so let’s get rolling.” 
“You said before that you 
didn’t think we’d make it.” 

“I’ve revised my opinion. Now 
I think we will.” 

“After all we’ve been through?” 
“After all we’ve been through.” 
“What more do we have to 
fight with?” 


GALAXY 


“I don’t know ell that yet.” 
“But on the other hand, we 
know everything there is behind 
us. We know how to avoid a lot 
of it now.” 

Tanner nodded. 

“You tried to cut out once. 
Now I don’t blame you.” 

“You getting scared, Greg?” 
“I’m no good to my family if 
I’m dead.” 

“Then why’d you agree to 
come along?” 

“I didn’t know it would be like 
this. You had better sense, be- 
cause you had an idea what it 
would be like.” 

“I had an idea.” 

“Nobody can blame us if we 
fail. After all, we’ve tried.” 
“What about all those people 
in Boston you made me a speech 
about?” 

“They’re probably dead by 
now. The plague isn’t a thing 
that takes its time, you know?” 
“What about that guy Brady? 
He died to get us the news.” 
“He tried, and God knows I re- 
spect the attempt. But we’ve al- 
ready lost four guys. Now should 
we make it six, just to show that 
everybody tried?” 

“Greg, we’re a lot closer to 
Boston than we are to L.A. now. 
The tanks should have enough 
fuel in them to get us where 
we’re going, but not to take us 
back from here.” 

“We can refuel in Salt Lake.” 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


“I’m not even sure we could 
make it back to Salt Lake.” 
“Well, it’ll only take a minute 
to figure it out. For that matter, 
though, we could take the bikes 
for the last hundred or so. They 
use a lot less gas.” 

“And you’re the guy was call- 
ing me names. You’re the citizen 
was wondering how people like 
me happen. You asked me what 
they ever did to me. I told you, 
too: Nothing. Now maybe I want 
to do something for them, just 
because I feel like it. I’ve been 
doing a lot of thinking.” 

“You ain’t supporting any 
family, Hell. I’ve got other peo- 
ple to worry about beside my- 
self. 

“You’ve got a nice way of 
putting things when you want to 
chicken out. You say I’m not 
really scared, but I’ve got my 
mother and my brothers and 
sisters to worry about, and I got 
a chick I’m hot on. That’s why 
I’m backing down. No other 
reason. 

“And that’s right, too! I don’t 
understand you, Hell! I don’t un- 
derstand you at all! You’re the , 
one who put this idea in my head 
in the first place!” 

“So give it back, and let’s get 
moving.” 

TTe saw Greg’s hand slither to- 
ward the gun on the door, so 
he flipped his cigarette into his 

45 



face and managed to hit him 
once, in the stomach — a weak, 
left-handed blow, but it was the 
beet he could manage from that 
position. 

Then Greg threw himself upon 
him, and he felt himself borne 
back into his seat. They wrestled, 
and Greg’s fingers clawed their 
way up his face toward his eyes. 

Tanner got his arms free above 
the elbows, seized Greg’s head, 
twisted and shoved with all his 
strength. 

Greg hit the dashboard, went 
stiff, then went slack. 

Tanner banged his head against 
it twice more, just to be sure he 
wasn’t faking. Then he pushed 
him away and moved back into

the driver’s seat. He checked all 
the screens while he caught his 
breath. There was nothing men- 
acing approaching. 

He fetched cord from the 
utility chest and bound Greg’s 
hands behind his back. He tied 
his ankles together and ran a line 
from them to his wrists. Then he 
positioned him in the seat, re- 
clined it part way and tied him 
in place within it. 

He put the car into gear and 
headed toward Ohio. 

Two hours later Greg began 
to moan, and Tanner turned the 
music up to drown him out. 
Landscape had appeared once 
more: grass and trees, fields of 
green, orchards of apples, apples 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


still small and green, white farm 
houses and brown barns and red 
barns far removed from the road- 
way he raced along; rows of com, 
green and swaying, brown tassels 
already visible and obviously 
tended by someone; fences of 
split timber, green hedges; lofty, 
star-leafed maples, fresh-looking 
road signs, a green-shingled 
steeple from which the sound of 
a bell came forth. 

The lines in the sky widen- 
ed, but the sky itself did not 
darken, as it usually did before a 
storm. So he drove on into the 
afternoon, until he reached the 
Dayton Abyss. 

He looked down into the fog- 
shrouded canyon that had caused 
him to halt. He scanned to the 
left and the right, decided upon 
the left and headed north. 

Again, the radiation level was 
high. And he hurried, slowing 
only to skirt the crevices, chasms 
and canyons that emanated from 
that dark, deep center. Thick 
yellow vapors seeped forth from 
some of these and filled the air 
before him. At one point they 
were all about him, like a cling- 
ing, sulphurous cloud, and a 
breeze came and parted them. In- 
voluntarily then, he hit the brake, 
and the car jerked and halted 
and Greg moaned once more. He 
stared at the thing for the few 
seconds that it was visible, then 
slowly moved forward again. 

47 


The sight was not duplicated 
for the whole of his passage, but 
it did not easily go from out of 
his mind, and he could not ex- 
plain it where he had seen it. 
Yellow, hanging and grinning, 
he had seen a crucified skeleton 
there beside the Abyss. People, 
he decided. That explains every- 
thing. 

\ A, 7" hen he left the region of 

' ' fogs the sky was still dark. 
He did not realize for a time that 
he was in the open once more. It 
had taken him close to four 
hours to skirt Dayton, and now 
as he headed across a blasted 
heath, going east again, he saw 
for a moment a tiny piece of the 
sun, like a sickle, fighting its way 
ashore on the northern bank of a 
black river in the sky, and fail- 
ing. 

His lights were turned up to 
their fullest intensity, and as he 
realized what might follow he 
looked in every direction for 
shelter. 

There was an old barn on a 
hill, and he raced toward it. One 
side had caved in, and the doors 
had fallen down. He edged in, 
however, and the interior was 
moist and moldy looking under 
his lights. He saw a skeleton 
Which he guessed to be that of a 
horse within a fallen-down stall. 

He parked and turned off his 
lights and waited. 

48 


Soon the wailing came again 
and drowned out Greg’s oc- 
casional moans and mutterings. 
There came another sound, not 
hard and heavy like gunfire, as 
that which he had heard in L.A., 
but gentle, steady and almost 
purring. 

He cracked the door, to hear it 
better. 

Nothing assailed him, so he 
stepped down from the cab and 
walked back a ways. The radia- 
tion level was almost normal, so 
he didn’t bother with his protec- 
tive suit. He walked back toward 
the fallen doors and looked out- 
side. He wore the pistol behind 
his belt. 

Something gray descended in 
droplets and the sun fought itself 
partly free once more. 

It was rain, pure and simple. 
He had never seen rain, pure and 
simple, before. So he lit a ciga- 
rette and watched it fall. 

It came down with only an oc- 
casional rumbling and nothing 
else accompanied it. The sky was 
still a bluish color beyond the 
bands of black. 

It fell all about him. It ran 
down the frame to his left. A 
random gust of wind blew some 
droplets into his face, and he 
realized that they were water, 
nothing more. Puddles formed 
on the ground outside. He tossed 
a chunk of wood into one and 
saw it splash and float. From 

GALAXY 


somewhere high up inside Hie 
foam he heard the sound of birds. 
He smelled the sick-sweet smell 
of decaying straw. Off in the 
shadows to his right he saw a 
rusted threshing machine. Some 
feathers drifted down about him, 
and he caught one in his hand 
and studied it. Light, dark, 
fluffy, ribbed. He’d never really 
looked at a feather before. It 
worked almost like a zipper, the 
way the individual branches 
clung to one another. He let it 
go, and the wind caught it, and it 
vanished somewhere toward his 
back. He looked out once more, 
and back along his trail. He could 
probably drive through what was 
coming down now. But he re- 
alized just how tired he was. He 
found a barrel and sat down on 
it and lit another cigarette. 

It had been a good run so far, 
and he found himself thinking 
about its last stages. He couldn’t 
trust Greg for awhile yet. Not 
until they were so far that there 
could be no turning back. Then 
they’d need each other so badly 
that he could turn him loose. He 
hoped he hadn’t scrambled his 
brains completely. He didn’t 
know what more the alley held. 
If the storms were less from here 
on in, however, that would be a 
big help. 

TTe sat there for a long while, 
feeling the cold, moist 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


breezes; and the rainfall lessened 
after a time, and he went back to 
the car and started it. Greg was 
still unconscious, he noted, as he 
backed out. This might not be 
good. 

He took a pill to keep himself 
alert and he ate some rations as 
he drove along. The rain con- 
tinued to come down, but gently. 
It fell all the way across Ohio, 
and the sky remained overcast. 
He crossed into West Virginia at 
the place called Parkersburg, and 
then he veered slightly to the 
north, going by the old Rand 
McNally he’d been furnished. The 
gray day went away into black 
night, and he drove on. 

There were no more of the 
dark bats around to trouble him, 
but he passed several more cra- 
ters and the radiation gauge rose, 
and at one point a pack of huge 
wild dogs pursued him, baying 
and howling, and they ran along 
the road and snapped at his tires 
and barked and yammered and 
then fell back. There were some 
tremors beneath his wheels as he 
passed another mountain and it 
spewed forth bright clouds to his 
left and made a kind of thunder. 
Ashes fell, and he drove through 
them. A flash flood splashed over 
him, and the engine sputtered and 
died, twice; but he started it 
again each time and pushed on 
ahead, the waters lapping about 
his sides. Then he reached higher, 

49 


drier ground, and riflemen tried 
to bar his way. He strafed them 
and hurled a grenade and drove 
on by. When the darkness went 
away and the dim moon came 
up, dark birds circled him and 
dove down at him, but he ignored 
them and after a time they, too, 
were gone. 

He drove until he felt tired 
again, and then he ate some more 
and took another pill. By then 
he was in Pennsylvania, and he 
felt that if Greg would only 
come around he would turn him 
loose and trust him with the 
driving. 

He halted twice to visit the la- 
trine, and he tugged at the 
golden band in his pierced left 
ear, and he blew his nose and 
scratched himself. Then he ate 
more rations and continued on. 

He began to ache, in all his 
muscles, and he wanted to stop 
and rest, but he was afraid of the 
things that might come upon him 
if he did. 

As he drove through another 
dead town, the rains started 
again. Not hard, just a drizzly 
downpour, cold -looking and ster- 
ile — a brittle, shiny screen. He 
stopped in the middle of the road 
before the thing he’d almost 
driven into, and he stared at it. 

He’d thought at first that it 
was more black lines in the sky. 
He’d halted because they’d 
seemed to appear too suddenly. 
50 


It was a spider’s web, strands 
thick as his arm, strung between 
two leaning buildings. 

He switched on his forward 
flame and began to bum it. 

When the fires died, he saw 
the approaching shape, coming 
down from high above. 

It was a spider, larger than 
himself, rushing to check the 
disturbance. 

He elevated the rocket laun- 
chers, took careful aim and 
pierced it with one white-hot 
missile. 

It still hung there in the trem- 
bling web and seemed to be kick- 
ing. 

He turned on the flame again, 
for a full ten seconds, and when 
it subsided there was an open 
way before him. 

He rushed through, wide awake 
and alert once again, his pains 
forgotten. He drove as fast as he 
could, trying to forget the sight. 

Another mountain smoked, 
ahead and to his right, but it did 
not bloom, and few ashes des- 
cended as he passed it. 

He made coffee and drank a 
cup. After awhile it was morning, 
and he raced toward it. 

XI 

H e was stuck in the mud, 
somewhere in eastern Penn- 
sylvania, and cursing. Greg was 
looking very pale. The sun was 

GALAXY 


nearing midheaven. He leaned 
back and closed his eyes. It was 
too much. 

He slept. 

He awoke and felt worse. 
There was a banging on the side 
of the car. His hands moved to- 
ward fire-control and wing-con- 
trol, automatically, and his eyes 
sought the screens. 

He saw an old man, and there 
were two younger men with him. 
They were armed, but they stood 
right before the left wing, and he 
knew he could cut them in half 
in an instant. 

He activated the outside 
speaker and the audio pickup. 

“What do you want?” he 
asked, and his voice crackled 
forth. 

“You okay?” the old man 
called. 

“Not really. You caught me 
sleeping.” 

“You stuck?” 

“That’s about the size of it.” 

“I got a mule team can maybe 
get you out. Can’t get ’em here 
before tomorrow morning, 
though.” 

“Great!” said Tanner. “I’d ap- 
preciated it.” 

“Where you from?” 

“L.A.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Los Angeles. West Coast.” 

There was some murmuring, 
then, “You’re a long way from 
home, mister.” 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


“Don’t I know it. — Look, if 
you’re serious about those mules, 
I’d appreciate hell out of it. It’s 
an emergency.” 

“What kind of?” 

“You know about Boston?” 

“I know it’s there.” 

“Well, people are dying up 
that way, of the plague. I’ve got 
drugs here can save them, if I 
can get through.” 

There were some more mur- 
murs, then, “We’ll help you. 
Boston’s pretty important, and 
we’ll get you loose. Want to come 
back with us?” 

“Where? And who are you?” 
“The name’s Samuel Potter, 
and these are my sons, Roderick 
and Caliban. My farm’s about 
six miles off. You’re welcome to 
spend the night.” 

“It’s not that I don’t trust 
you,” said Tanner. “It’s just that 
I don’t trust anybody, if you 
know what I mean. I’ve been 
shot at too much recently to 
want to take the chance.” 

“Well, how about if we put up 
our guns? You’re probably able 
to shoot us from there, ain’t you?” 
“That’s right.” 

“So we’re taking a chance just 
standing here. We’re willing to 
help you. We’d stand to lose if 
the Boston traders stopped com- 
ing to Albany. If there’s someone 
else inside, he can cover you.” 
“Wait a minute,” said Tanner, 
and he opened the door. 

51 


'T'he old man stuck out his 
hand, and Tanner took it and 
shook it, also his sons’. 

“Is there any kind of doctor 
around here?” he asked. 

“In the settlement — about 
thirty miles north.” 

“My partner’s hurt. I think he 
needs a doctor.” He gestured 
back, toward the cab. 

Sam moved forward and peered 
within. 

“Why’s he all trussed up like 
that?” 

“He went off his rocker, and I 
had to clobber him. I tied him 
up, to be safe. But now he doesn’t 
look so good.” 

“Then let’s whip up a stretcher 
and get him onto it. You lock 
up tight then, and my boys’ll 
bring him back to the house. 
We’ll send someone for the Doc. 
You don’t look so good yourself. 
Bet you’d like a bath and a shave 
and a clean bed.” 

“I don’t feel so good,” Tanner 
said. “Let’s make that stretcher 
quick, before we need two.” 

He sat up on the fender and 
smoked while the Potter boys 
cut trees and stripped them. 
Waves of fatigue washed over 
him, and he found it hard to keep 
his eyes open. His feet felt very 
far away, and his shoulders 
ached. The cigarette fell from his 
fingers, and he leaned backward 
on the hood. 

Someone was slapping his leg. 

52 


He forced his eyes open and 
looked down. 

“Okay,” Potter said. “We cut 
your partner loose and we got 
him on the stretcher. Want to 
lock up and get moving?” 

Tanner nodded and jumped 
down. He sank almost up to his 
boot tops when he hit, but he 
closed the cab and staggered to- 
ward the old man in buckskin. 

They began walking across 
country, and after awhile it be- 
came mechanical. 

Samuel Potter kept up a 
steady line of chatter as he led 
the way, rifle resting in the 
crook of his arm. Maybe it was 
to keep Tanner awake. 

“It’s not too far, son, and 
it’ll be pretty easy going in just 
a few minutes now. What’d you 
say your name was anyhow?” 

“Hell,” said Tanner. 

“Beg pardon?” 

“Hell. Hell’s my name. Hell 
Tanner.” 

am Potter chuckled. 

“That’s a pretty mean name, 
mister. If it’s okay with you, I’ll 
introduce you to my wife and 
the youngest as ‘Mister Tanner’. 
All right?” 

“That’s just fine,” Tanner 
gasped, pulling his boots out of 
the mire with a sucking sound. 

“We’d sure miss them Boston 
traders. I hope you make it in 
time.” 


GALAXY 


| “What is it that they do?” 
“They keep shops in Albany, 
and twice a year they give a fair 
— spring and fall. They carry 
all sort of things we need — 
needles, thread, pepper, kettles, 
pans, seed, guns and ammo, all 
kind of things — and the fairs 
are pretty good times, too. Most 
anybody between here and there 
would help you along. Hope you 
make it. We’ll get you off to a 
good start again.” 

They reached higher, drier 
ground. 

“You mean it’s pretty clear 
sailing after this?” 

“Well, no. But I’ll help you on 
a map and tell you what to look 
out for.” 

“I got mine with me,” said 
Tanner, as they topped a hill, 
and he saw a farm house off in 
the distance. “That your place?” 
“Correct. It ain’t much further 
now. Real easy walkin’ — an’ 
you just lean on my shoulder if 
you get tired.” 

“I can make it,” said Tanner. 
“It’s just that I had so many of 
those pills to keep me awake 
that I’m starting to feel all the 
sleep I’ve been missing. I’ll be 
okay.” 

“You’ll get to sleep real soon 
now. And when you’re awake 
again, we’ll go over that map 
of yours, and you can write in all 
the places I tell you about.” 
“Good scene,” said Tanner, 
DAMNATION ALLEY 


“good scene,” and he put his 
hand on Sam’s shoulder then 
and staggered along beside him, 
feeling almost drunk and wishing 
he were. 

After a hazy eternity he saw 
the house before him, then the 
door. The door swung open, and 
he felt himself falling forward, 
and that was it. 

XII 

S leep. Blackness, distant voices, 
more blackness. Wherever 
he lay, it was soft, and he turned 
over onto his other side and went 
away again. 

When everything finally 
flowed together into a coherent 
ball and he opened his eyes, 
there was light streaming in 
through the window to his right, 
falling in rectangles upon the 
patchwork quilt that covered 
him. He groaned, stretched, rub- 
bed his eyes and scratched his 
beard. 

He surveyed the room care- 
fully: polished wooden floors 

with handwoven rugs of blue 
and red and gray scattered about 
them, a dresser holding a white 
enamel basin with a few black 
spots up near its lip where some 
of the enamel had chipped away, 
a mirror on the wall behind him 
and above all that, a spindly 
looking rocker near the window, 
a print cushion on its seat, a 

53 


small table against the other 
wall with a chair pushed in be- 
neath it, books and paper and 
pen and ink on the table, a hand- 
stitrihed sampler on the wall 
asking God to Bless, a blue and 
green print of a waterfall on the 
other wall. 

He sat up, discovered he was 
naked, looked around for his 
clothing. It was nowhere in sight. 

As he sat there, deciding 
whether or not to call out, the 
door opened, and Sam walked in. 
He carried Tanner’s clothing, 
clean and neatly folded, over one 
arm. In his other hand he carried 
his boots, and they shone like wet 
midnight. 

“Heard you stirring around,” 
he said. “How you feeling now?” 
“A lot better, thanks.” 

“We’ve got a bath all drawn. 
Just have to dump in a couple 
buckets of hot, and it’s all yours. 
I’ll have the boys carry it in in a 
minute, and some soap and 
towels.” 

Tanner bit his lip, but he 
didn’t want to seem inhospitable 
to fiis benefactor, so he nodded 
an4 forced a smile then. 

“That’ll be fine.” 

“ . And there’s a razor and a 
scissors on the dresser — which- 
ever you might want.” 

He nodded again. Sam set his 
clothes down on the rocker and 
his boots on the floor beside it, 
then left the room. 

54 


Soon Roderick and Calibap 
brought in the tub, spread some 
sacks and set it upon them. 

“How you feeling?” one of 
them asked. (Tanner wasn’t sure 
Which was which. They both 
seemed graceful as scarecrows, 
and their mouths were packed 
full of white teeth.) 

“Real good,” he said. 

“Bet you’re hungry,” said the 
other. “You slep’ all afternoon 
yesterday and all night and most 
of this morning.” 

“You know it,” said Tanner. 
“How’s my partner?” 

The nearer one shook his head, 
and, “Still sleeping and sicldy,” 
he said. “The Doc should be here 
soon. Our kid brother went after 
him last night.” 

They turned to leave, and the 
one who had been speaking 
added, “Soon as you get cleaned 
up, Ma’ll fix you something to 
eat. Cal and me are going out 
now to try and get your rig loose. 
Bad’ll tell you about the roads 
while you eat.” 

“Thanks.” 

“Good morning to you.” 

“ ‘Morning.” 

They closed the door behind 
them as they left. 

'T'anner got up and moved to 
the mirror, studied himself. 

“Well, just this once,” he mut- 
tered. 

Then he washed his face and 
GALAXY 


trimmed his beard and cut his 
hair. 

Then, gritting his teeth, he 
lowered himself into the tub, 
soaped up and scrubbed. The 
water grew gray and scummy be- 
neath the suds. He splashed out 
and toweled himself down and 
dressed. 

He was starched and crinkly 
and smelled faintly of disinfec- 
tant. He smiled at his dark- 
eyed reflection and lit a cigarette. 
He combed his hair and studied 
the stranger. “Damn! I’m beauti- 
ful!” he chuckled, and then he 
opened the door and entered the 
kitchen. 

Sam was sitting at the table 
drinking a cup of coffee, and his 
wife Who was short and heavy and 
wore long gray skirts was facing 
in the other direction, leaning 
over the stove. She turned, and 
he saw that her face was large, 
with bulging red cheeks that 
dimpled and a little white scar in 
the middle of her forehead. Her 
hair was brown, shot through 
with gray, and pulled back into 
a knot. She bobbed her head and 
smiled a “Good morning” at him. 

“ ’Morning,” he replied. “I’m 
afraid I left kind of a mess in the 
other room.” 

“Don’t worry about that,” said 
Sam. “Seat yourself, and we’ll 
have you some breakfast in a 
minute. The boys told you about 
your friend?” 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


Tanner nodded. 

As she placed a cup of coffee 
in front of Tanner, Sam said, 
“Wife’s name’s Susan.” 

“How do,” she said. 

“Hi.” 

“Now, then, I got your map 
here. Saw it sticking out of your 
jacket. That’s your gun hanging 
aside the door, too. Anyhows, I’ve 
been figuring and I think the best 
way you could head would be up 
to Albany and then go along the 
old Route 9, which is in pretty 
good shape.” He spread the map 
and pointed as he talked. “Now, 
it won’t be all of a picnic,” he 
said, “but it looks like the clean- 
est and fastest way in — ” 
“Breakfast,” said his wife 'and 
pushed the map aside to set a 
plate full of eggs and bacon and 
sausages in front of Tanner and 
another one, holding four pieces 
of toast, next to it. There was 
marmalade, jam, jelly and butter 
on the table, and Tanner helped 
himself to it and sipped the cof- 
fee and filled the empty places 
inside while Sam talked. 

He told him about the gangs 
that ran between Boston and Al- 
bany on bikes, hijacking any- 
thing they could, and that was 
the reason most cargo went in 
convoys with shotgun riders 
aboard. “But you don’t have to 
worry, with that rig of yours, do 
you?” he asked, and Tanner said, 
“Hope not,” and wolfed down 

55 


Wore food. He wondered, 
though, if they were anything 
like his old pack, and he hoped 
not, again, for both their sakes. 

Tanner raised his coffee cup, 
and he heard a sound outside. 

nphe door opened, and a boy 
ran into the kitchen. Tanner 
figured him as between ten and 
twelve years of age. An older 
man followed him, carrying the 
traditional black bag. 

“We’re here! We’re here!” 
cried the boy, and Sam stood 
and shook hands with the man, 
so Tanner figured he should, too. 
He wiped his mouth and gripped 
the man’s hand and said, “My 
partner sort of went out of his 
head. He jumped me, and we had 
a fight. I shoved him, and he 
banged his head on the dash- 
board.” 

The doctor, a dark -haired man, 
probably in his late forties, wore 
a dark suit. His face was heavily 
lined, and his eyes looked tired. 
He nodded. 

Sam said, “I’ll take you to 
him,” and he led him out through 
the door at the other end of the 
kitchen. 

Tanner reseated himself and 
picked up the last piece of toast. 
Susan refilled his coffee cup, and 
he nodded to her. 

“My name’s Jerry,” said the 
boy, seating himself in his 
father’s abandoned chair. “Is 
56 


your name, mister, really Hell?” 
“Hush, you!” said 'his mother. 

“ ’Fraid so,” said Tanner. 

“. And you drove all the 
way across the country? Through 
the Alley?” 

“So far.” 

“What was it like?” 

“Mean.” 

“What ail’d you see?” 

“Bats as big as this kitchen — 
some of them even bigger — on 
the other side of the Missus Hip. 
Lot of them in Saint Louis.” 
“What’d you do?” 

“Shot ’em. Burnt ’em. Drove 
through ’em.” 

“What else you see?” 

“Gila monsters. Big, techni- 
color lizards — the size of a ' 
bam. Dust Devils — big circling 
winds that sucked up one oar. 
Fire-topped mountains. Real big 
thorn bushes that we had to 
burn. Drove through some 
storms. Drove over places where 
the ground was like glass. Drove 
along where the ground was 
shaking. Drove around big cra- 
ters, all radioactive.” 

“Wish I could do that some 
day.” 

“Maybe you will, some day.” 
Tanner finished the food and 
lit a cigarette and sipped the 
coffee. 

“Real good breakfast,” he 
called out. “Best I’ve eaten in 
days. Thanks.” 

Susan smiled, then said, “Jerry, 
GALAXY 


don’t go an’ pester the man.” 
i “No bother, Missus. He’s 
okay.” 

“What’s that ring on your 
hand?” said Jerry. “It looks like 
a snake.” 

“That’s what it is,” said Tan- 
ner, pulling it off. “If is sterling 
silver with red glass eyes, and I 
got it in a place called Tijuana. 
Here. You keep it.” 

<CT couldn’t take that,” said the 
boy, and he looked at his 
mother, his eyes asking if he 
could. She shook her head from 
left to right, and Tanner saw it 
and said, “Your folks were good 
enough to help me out and get 
a Doc for my partner and feed 
me and give me a place to sleep. 
I’m sure they won’t mind if I 
want to show my appreciation a 
little bit and give you this ring,” 
and Jerry looked back at his 
mother, and Tanner nodded and 
she nodded too. 

Jerry whistled and jumped up 
and put it on his finger. 

“It’s too big,” he said. 

“Here, let me mash it a bit for 
you. These spiral kind’ll fit any- 
body if you squeeze them a lit- 
tle.” 

He squeezed the ring and gave 
it back to the boy to try on. It 
was still too big, so he squeezed 
it again and then it fit. 

Jerry put it on and began to 
run from the room. 

DAMNATION ALLEY 


“Wait!” his mother said. “What 
do you say?” 

He turned around and said, 
“Thank you, Hell.” 

“Mister Tanner,” she said. 

“Mister Tanner,” the boy re- 
peated, and the door banged be- 
hind him. 

“That was good of you,” she 
said. 

Tanner shrugged. 

“He liked it,” he said. “Glad I 
could turn him on with it.” 

He finished his coffee and his 
cigarette, and she gave him an- 
other cup, and he lit another cig- 
arette. After a time, Sam and' the 
doctor came out of the other 
room, and' Tanner began wonder- 
ing where the family had slept 
the night before. Susan poured 
them both coffee, and they seated 
themselves at the table to dnhk 
it. 

“Your friend’s got a concus- 
sion,” the doctor said. “I can’t 
really tell how serious his condi- 
tion is without getting X ra^S, 
and there’s no way of getting 
them here. I wouldn’t recommend 
moving him, though.” 

Tanner said, “For how long?” 

“Maybe a few days, maybe a 
couple weeks. I’ve left some med- 
ication and told Sam what to do 
for him. Sam says there’s a 
plague in Boston and you’ve got 
to hurry. My advice is that you 
go on without him. Leave him 
here with the Potters. He’ll be 

57 


taken care of. He can go up to 
Albany with them for the Spring 
Fair and make his way to Boston 
from there on some commercial 
carrier. I think he’11 foe all right.” 
Tanner thought about it 
awhile, then nodded. 

“Okay,” he said, “if that’s the 
way it’s got to be.” 

“That’s what I recommend.” 
They drank their coffee. 

XIII 

'T'anner regarded his freed ve- 
hide, said, “I guess I’ll be 
going, then,” and nodded to the 
Potters. “Thanks,” he said, and 
he unlocked the cab, climbed in- 
to it and started the engine. He 
put it into gear, blew the horn 
twice and started to move. 

In the screen, he saw the three 
men waving. He stamped the ac- 
celerator, and they were gone 
from sight. 

He sped ahead, and the way 
was easy. The sky was salmon 
pink. The earth was brown, and 
there was much green grass. The 
bright sun caught the day in a 
silver net. 

This part of the country seem- 
ed virtually untouched by the 
chaos that had produced the rest 
of the Alley. Tanner played mu- 
sic, drove along. He passed two 
tracks on the road and honked 
nis horn each time. Once, he re- 
ceived a reply. 


He drove all that day, arfd it 
was well into the night when he 
pulled into Albany. The streets 
themselves were dark, and only a 
few lights shone from the build- 
ings. He drew up in front of a 
flickering red sign that said 
“BAR & GRILL,” parked and 
entered. 

It was small, and there was 
jukebox music playing, tunes 
he’d never heard before, and the 
lighting was poor, and there was 
sawdust on the floor. 

He sat down at the bar and 
pushed the Magnum way down 
behind his belt so that it didn’t 
show. Then he took off his jacket, 
because of the heat in the place, 
and he threw it on the stool next 
to Ihim. When the man in the 
white apron approached, he said, 
“Give me a shot and a beer and 
a ham sandwich.” 

The man nodded his bald head 
and threw a shot glass in front 
of Tanner, which he then filled. 
Then he siphoned off a foam- 
capped mug and hollered over 
his right shoulder. 

Tanner tossed off the shot and 
sipped the beer. After awhile, a 
white plate bearing a sandwich 
appeared on the sill across from 
him. After a longer while, the 
bartender passed, picked it up, 
and deposited it in front of him. 
He wrote something on a green 
chit and tucked it under the cor- 
ner of the plate.

GALAXY 


Tanner bit into the sandwich 
and washed it down with a 
mouthful of beer. He studied the 
people about him and decided 
they made the same noises as 
people in any other bar he’d ever 
been in. The old man to his left 
looked friendly, so he asked him, 
“Any news about Boston?” 

The man’s chin quivered be- 
tween words, and it seemed a 
natural thing for him. 

“No news at all. Looks like the 
merchants will close their shops 
at the end of the week.” 

“What day is today?” 
“Tuesday.” 

Tanner finished his sandwich 
and smoked a cigarette while he 
drank the rest of his beer. 

Then he looked at the check, 
and it said, “.85.” 

He tossed a dollar bill on top 
Of it and turned to go. 

T Te had taken two steps when 
* the bartender called out, 
“Wait a minute, mister.” 

He turned around. 

“Yeah?” 

“What you trying to pull?” 
“What do you mean?” 

“What do you call this crap?” 
“What crap?” 

The man waved Tanner’s dol- 
lar at him, and he stepped for- 
ward and inspected it. 

“Nothing wrong I can see. 
What’s giving you a pain?” 
“That ain’t money.” 


“You trying to tell me my 
money’s no good?” 

“That’s what I said. I never 
seen no bill like that.” 

“Well, look at it real careful. 
Read that print down there at 
the bottom of it.” 

The room grew quiet. One man 
got off his stool and walked for- 
ward. He held out his hand and 
said, “Let me see it, Bill.” 

The bartender passed it to him, 
and the man’s eyes widened. 

“This is drawn on the Bank of 
the Nation of California.” 

“Well, that’s where I’m from,” 
said Tanner. 

“I’m sorry, it’s no good here,” 
said the bartender. 

“It’s the best I got,” said Tan- 
ner. 

“Well, nobody’ll make good on 
it around here. You got any Bos- 
ton money on you?” 

“Never been to Boston.” 
“Then how the hell’d you get 
here?” 

“Drove.” 

“Don’t hand me that line of 
crap, son. Where’d you steal 
this?” It was the older man who 
had spoken. 

“You going to take my money 
or ain’t you?” said Tanner. 

“I’m not going to take it,” said 
the bartender. 

“Then screw you,” said Tan- 
ner, and he turned and walked 
toward the door. 

As always, under such circum- 

59 


DAMNATION ALLEY 


stances, he was alert to sounds 
at his back. 

When he heard the quick foot- 
fall, he turned. It was the man 
who had inspected the bill that 
stood before him, his right arm 
extended. 

Tanner’s right hand held his 
leather jacket, draped over his 
right shoulder. He swung it with 
all his strength, forward and 
down. 

It struck the man on the top 
of his head, and he fell. 

There came up a murmuring, 
and several people jumped to 
their feet and moved toward him. 

Tanner dragged the gun from 
his belt and said, “Sorry, folks,” 
and he pointed it, and they stop- 
ped. 

“Now you probably ain’t about 
to believe me,” he said, “when I 
tell you that Boston’s been hit 
by the plague, but it’s true all 
right. Or maybe you will, I don’t 
know. But I don’t think you’re 
going to believe that I drove here 
all the way from the nation of 
California with a car full of Haf- 
fikine antiserum. But that’s just 
as right. You send that bill to the 
big bank in Boston, and they’ll 
change it for you, all right, and 
you know it. Now I’ve got to be 
going, and don’t anybody try to 
stop me. If you think I’ve been 
handing you a line, you take a 
look at what I drive away in. 
That’s all I’ve got to say.” 


And he backed out the door 
and covered it while he mounted 
the cab. Inside, he gunned the 
engine to life, turned, and roared 
away. 

In the rearview screen he could 
see the knot of people on the 
walk before the bar, watching 
him depart. 

He laughed, and the apple- 
blossom moon hung dead ahead. 

XIV 

A lbany, to Boston. A couple 
hundred miles. He’d man- 
aged the worst of it. The terrors 
of Damnation Alley lay largely 
at his back now. Night. It flowed 
about him. The stars seemed 
brighter than usual. He’d make 
it, the night seemed to say. 

He passed between hills. The 
road wasn’t too bad. It wound 
between trees and high grasses. 
He passed a truck coming in his 
direction and dimmed his lights 
as it approached. It did the same. 

It must have been around mid- 
night that he came to the cross- 
roads, and the lights suddenly 
nailed him from two directions. 

He was bathed in perhaps 
thirty beams from the left and 
as many from the right. 

He pushed the accelerator to 
the floor, and he heard engine 
after engine coming to life some- 
where at his back. And he rec- 
ognized the sounds.

GALAXY 


They were all of them bikes. 

They swung onto the road be- 
hind him. 

He could have opened fire. He 
could have braked and laid down 
a cloud of flame. It was obvious 
that they didn’t know what they 
were chasing. He could have 
launched grenades. He refrained, 
however. 

It could have beeii him on the 
lead bike, he decided, all hot on 
hijack. He felt a certain sad kin- 
ship as his hand hovered above 
the fire-control. 

Try to outrun them, first. 

His engine was open wide and 
roaring, but he couldn’t take the 
hikes. 

When they began to fire, he 
knew that he’d have to retaliate. 
He couldn’t risk their hitting a 
gas tank or blowing out his fires. 

Their first few shots had been 
in the nature of a warning. He 
couldn’t risk another barrage. If 
only they knew .... 

The speaker! 

He cut in and mashed the but- 
ton and spoke: 

“Listen, cats,” he said. “All I 
got’s medicine for the sick citi- 
zens in Boston. Let me through 
or you’ll hear the noise.” 

A shot followed immediately, 
so he opened fire with the fifty 
calibers to the rear. 

He saw them fall, but they 
kept firing. So he launched gren- 
ades. 


The firing lessened, but didn’t 
cease. 

So he hit the brakes, then the 
flame-throwers. He kept it up 
for fifteen seconds. 

There was silence. 

When the air cleared he studi- 
ed the screens. 

fTphey lay all over the road, 
their bikes upset, their bodies 
fuming. Several were still seated, 
and they held rifles and pointed 
them, and he shot them down. 

A few still moved, spasmodi- 
cally, and he was about to dritre 
on, when he saw one rise and 
take a few staggering steps and 
fall again. 

His hand hesitated on the gear- 
shift. 

It was a girl. 

He thought about it for per- 
haps five seconds, then jumped 
down from the cab and ran 
toward her. 

As he did, one man raised him- 
self on an elbow and picked up a 
fallen rifle. 

Tanner shot him twice and 
kept running, pistol in hand. 

The girl was crawling toward 
a man whose face had been shot 
away. Other bodies twisted about 
Tanner now, there on the road, in 
the glare of the tail beacons. 
Blood and black leather, the 
sounds of moaning and the 
stench of burnt flesh were all 
about him. 


DAMNATION ALLEY

When he got to the girl’s side, 
she cursed him softly as he stop- 
ped. 

None of the blood about her 
seemed to be her own. 

He dragged her to her feet and 
her eyes began to fill with tears. 

Everyone else was dead or dy- 
ing, so Tanner picked her up in 
his arms and carried her back 
to the car. He reclined the pas- 
senger seat and put her into it, 
moving the weapons into the rear 
seat, out of her reach. 

Then he gunned the engine and 
moved forward. In the rearview 
screen he saw two figures rise to 
their feet, then fall again. 

She was a tall girl, with long, 
uncombed hair the color of dirt. 
She had a strong chin and a wide 
mouth and there were dark cir- 
cles under her eyes. A single faint 
line crossed her forehead, and she 
had all of her teeth. The right 
side of her face was flushed, as 
if sunburnt. Her left trouser leg 
was tom and dirty. He guessed 
that she’d caught the edge of 
his flame and fallen from her 
bike. 

C CX7'ou okay?” he asked, when 
-*■ her sobbing had dimin- 
ished to a moist sniffing sound. 

“What’s it to you?” she said, 
raising a hand to her cheek. 

Tanner shrugged. 

“Just being friendly.” 

“You killed most of my gang.” 


“What would they have done 
to me?” 

“They would have stomped 
you, mister, if it weren’t for this 
fancy car of yours.” 

“It ain’t really mine,” he said. 
“It belongs to the nation of Cali- 
fornia.” 

“This thing don’t come front 
California.” 

“The hell it don’t. I drove it.” 
She sat up straight then and 
began rubbing her leg. 

Tanner lit a cigarette. 

“Give me a cigarette?” she 
said. 

He passed her the one he had 
lighted, lit himself another. As 
he handed it to her, her eyes rest- 
ed on his tattoo. 

“What’s that?” 

“My name.” 

“Hell?” 

“Hell.” 

“Where’d you get a name like 
that?” 

“From my old man.” 

They smoked awhile, then she 
said, “Why’d you run the Alley?” 
“Because it was the only way 
I could get them to turn me 
loose.” 

“From where?” 

“The place with horizontal Ve- 
netian blinds. I was doing time.” 
“They let you go? Why?” 
“Because of the big sick. I’m 
bringing in Haffikine antiserum.” 
“You’re Hell Tanner.” 

“Huh?”

GALAXY 


“Your last name’s Tanner, ain’t 

it?” 

“That’s right. Who told you?” 

“I heard about you. Everybody 
thought you died in the Big 
Raid.” 

“They were wrong.” 

“What was it like?” 

“I dunno. I was already wear- 
ing a zebra suit. That’s why I’m 
still around.” 

“Why’d you pick me up?” 

“ ’Cause you’re a chick, and 
’cause I didn’t want to see you 
croak.” 

“Thanks. You got anything to 
eat in here?” 

“Yeah, there’s food in there.” 
He pointed to the refrigerator 
door. “Help yourself.” 

She did, and as she ate Tan- 
ner asked her, “What do they 
call you?” 

“Corny,” she said. “It’s short 
for Cornelia.” 

“Okay, Corny,” he said. “When 
you’re finished eating, you start 
telling me about the road be- 
tween here and the place.” 

S he nodded, chewed and swal- 
lowed. Then, “There’s lots of 
other gangs,” she said. “So you’d 
better be ready to blast them.” 
“I am.” 

“Those screens show you all 
directions, huh?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Good. The roads are pretty 
much okay from here on in. 


There’s one big crater you’ll come 
to soon and a couple little vol- 
canos afterwards.” 

“Check.” 

“Outside of them there’s noth- 
ing to worry about but the Re- 
gents and the Devils and the 
Kings and the Lovers. That’s 
about it.” 

Tanner nodded. 

“How big are those clubs?” 

“I don’t know for sure, but the 
Kings are the biggest They’ve 
got a coupla hundred.” 

“What was your club?” 

“The Studs.” 

“What are you going to do 
now?” 

“Whatever you tell me.” 
“Okay, Corny. I’ll let you off 
anywhere along the way that you 
want me to. If you don’t want, 
you can come on into the city 
with me.” 

“You call it, Hell. Anywhere 
you want to go, I’ll go along.” 
Her voice was deep, and her 
words came slowly, and her tone 
sandpapered his eardrums just a 
bit. She had long legs and heavy 
thighs beneath the tight denim. 
Tanner licked his lips and studi- 
ed the screens. Did he want to 
keep her around for awhile? 

The road was suddenly wet. It 
was covered with hundreds of 
fishes, and more were falling 
from the sky. There followed sev- 
eral loud reports from overhead. 
The blue light began in the north. 


DAMNATION ALLEY 


63 


Tanner raced on, and suddenly 
there was water all about him. 
It fell upon his car, it dimmed 
his screens. The sky had grown 
black again, and the banshee- 
wail sounded above him. 

He skidded around a sharp 
curve in the road. He turned up 
liis lights. 

The rain ceased, but the wail- 
ing continued. He ran for fifteen 
minutes before it built up into a 
roai'. 

The girl stared at the screens 
and occasionally glanced at Tan- 
ner. 

“What’re you going to do?” 
she finally asked him. 

“Outrun it, if I can,” he said. 

“It’s dark for as far ahead as 
I can see. I don’t think you can 
do it.” 

“Neither do I, but what does 
that leave?” 

“Hole up someplace.” 

“If you know where, you show 
me.” 

“There’s a place a few miles 
further ahead — a bridge you 
can get under.” 

“Okay, that’s for us. Sing out 
when you see it.” 

Qhe pulled off her boots and 
^ rubbed her feet. He gave her 
another cigarette. 

“Hey, Corny — I just thought 
— there’s a medicine chest over 
there to your right. Yeah, that’s 
it. It should have some damn 


kind of salve in it you can smear 
on your face to take the bite out.” 
She found a tube of something 
and rubbed some of it into her 
cheek, smiled slightly and re- 
placed it. 

“Feel any better?” 

“Yes. Thanks.” 

The stones began to fall, the 
blue to spread. The sky pulsed, 
grew brighter. 

“I don’t like the looks of this 
one.” 

“I don’t like the looks of any 
of them.” 

“It seems there’s been an awful 
lot this past week.” 

“Yeah. I’ve heard it said may- 
be the winds are dying down — 
that the sky might be purging 
itself.” 

“That’d be nice,” said Tanner. 
“Then we might be able to see 
it the way it used to look — blue 
all the time, and with clouds. 
You know about clouds.” 

“I heard about them.” 

“White, puffy things that just 
sort of drift across — sometimes 
gray. They don’t drop anything 
except rain, and not always that.” 
“Yeah, I know.” 

“You ever see any out in 
L.A.?” 

“No.” 

The yellow streaks began, and 
the black lines writhed like 
snakes. The stonefall rattled 
heavily upon the roof and the 
hood. More water began to fall, 


64 


GALAXY 


and a fog rose up. Tanner was 
forced to slow, and then it seem- 
ed as if sledgehammers beat up- 
on the ear. 

“We won’t make it,” she said. 

“The hell you say. This thing’s 
built to take it — and what’s 
that off in the distance?” 

“The bridge!” she said, moving 
forward. “That’s it! Pull off the 
road to the left and go down. 
That’s a dry riverbed beneath.” 

Then the lightning began to 
fall. It flamed, flashed about 
them. They passed a burning 
tree, and there were still fishes 
in the roadway. 

Tanner turned left as he ap- 
proached the bridge. He slowed 
to a crawl and made his way over 
the shoulder and down the slick, 
muddy grade. 

When he hit the damp river- 
bed he turned right. He nosed it 
in under the bridge, and they 
were all alone there. Some waters 
trickled past them, and the light- 
nings continued to flash. The sky 
was a shifting kaleidoscope and 
constant came the thunder. He 
could hear a sound like hail on 
the bridge above them. 

“We’re safe,” he said and kill- 
ed the engine. 

“Are the doors locked?” 

“They do it automatically.” 

Tanner turned off the outside 
lights. 

“Wish I could buy you a drink, 
besides coffee.” 


“Coffee’d be good, just right.” 
“Okay, it’s on the way,” and 
he cleaned out the pot and filled 
it and plugged it in. 

nphey sat there and smoked as 
the storm raged, and he said, 
“You know, it’s a kind of nice 
feeling being all snug as a rat in 
a hole while everything goes to 
hell outside. Listen to that bas- 
tard come down! And we couldn’t 
care less.” 

“I suppose so,” she said. 
“What’re you going to do after 
you make it in to Boston?” 

“Oh, I don’t know .... Maybe 
get a job, scrape up some loot 
and maybe open a bike shop or 
a garage. Either one’d be nice.” 
“Sounds good. You going to 
ride much yourself?” 

“You bet. I don’t suppose they 
have any good clubs in town?” 
“No. They’re all roadrunners.” 
“Thought so. Maybe I’ll or- 
ganize my own.” 

He reached out and touched 
her hand, then squeezed 1 it. 

“I can buy you a drink.” 
“What do you mean?” 

She drew a plastic flask from 
the right side pocket of her jack- 
et. She uncapped it and passed 
it to him. 

“Here.” 

He took a mouthful and gulped 
it, coughed, took a second, then 
handed it back. 

“Great! You’re a woman of un- 


DAMNATION ALLEY 


65 


Suspected potential and like that. 
Thanks.” 

“Don’t mention it,” and she 
took a drink herself and set the 
flask on the dash. 

“Cigarette?” 

“Just a minute.” 

He lit two, passed her one. 
“There you are, Corny.” 
“Thanks. I’d like to help you 
finish this ran.” 

“How come?” 

“I got nothing else to do. My 
crowd’s all gone away, and I’ve 
got nobody else to run with now. 
Also, if you make it, you’ll be a 
big man. Like capital letters. 
.Think you might keep me around 
after that?” 

“Maybe. What are you like?” 
“Oh, I’m real nice. I’ll even 
mb your shoulders for you when 
they’re sore.” 

“They’re sore now.” 

“I thought so. Give me a lean.” 

TT e bent toward her, and she 
began to rub his shoulders. 
Her hands were quick and strong. 
“You do that good, girl.” 
“Thanks.” 

He straightened up, leaned 
back. Then he reached out, took 
the flask and had another drink. 
She took a small sip when he 
passed it to tier. 

The furies rode about them, 
but the bridge above stood the 
siege. Tanner turned off the 
lights. 


“Let’s make it,” he said, and 
he seized her and drew her to 
him. 

She did not resist him, and he 
found her belt buckle and un- 
fastened it. Then he started on 
the buttons. After awhile, he re- 
clined her seat. 

“Will you keep me?” she asked 
him. 

“Sure.” 

“I’ll help you. I’ll do anything 
you say to get you through.” 

“Great.” 

“After all, if Boston goes, then 
we go, too.” 

“You bet.” 

Then they didn’t say much 
more. 

There was violence in the skies, 
and after that came darkness and 
quiet.

X TThen Tanner awoke, it was 
* ^ morning and Hie storm 
had ceased. He repaired himself 
to the rear of the vehicle and 
after that assumed the driver’s 
seat once more. 

Cornelia did not awaken as he 
gunned the engine to life and 
started' up the weed-infested 
slope of the hillside. 

The sky was light once more, 
and the road was strewn with 
rubble. Tanner wove along it, 
heading toward the pale sun, and 
after awhile Cornelia stretched.

“Ungh,” she said, and Tanner 
agreed. “My shoulders are better 
now,” he told her. 

“Good,” and Tanner headed 
up a hill, slowly as the day dim- 
med and one huge black line be- 
came the Devil's highway down 
the middle of the sky. 

As he drove through a wooded 
valley, the rain began to fall. The 
girl had returned from the rear 
of the vehicle and was preparing 
breakfast when Tanner saw the 
tiny dot on the horizon, switched 
over to his telescope lenses and 
tried to outrun what he saw. 

Cornelia looked up. 

There were bikes, bikes, and 
more bikes on their trail. 

“Those your people?” Tanner 
asked. 

“No. You took mine yester- 
day.” 

“Too bad,” said Tanner, and 
he pushed the accelerator to the 
floor and hoped for a storm. 

They squealed around a curve 
and climbed another hill. His 
pursuers drew nearer. He switch- 
ed back from telescope to normal 
scanning, but even then he could 
see the size of the crowd that ap- 
proached. 

“It must be the Kings,” she 
said. “They’re the biggest club 
around.” 

“Too bad,” said Tanner. 

“For them or for us?” 

“Both.” 

She smiled. 


“I’d like to see how you work 
this thing.” 

“It looks like you’re going to 
get a chance. They’re gaining on 
us like mad.” 

The rain lessened, but the fogs 
grew heavier. Tanner could see 
their lights, though, over a quar- 
ter mile to his rear, and he did 
not turn his own on. He estimat- 
ed a hundred to a hundred fifty 
pursuers that cold, dark morning, 
and he asked, “How near are we 
to Boston?” 

“Maybe ninety miles,” she told 
him. 

“Too bad they’re chasing us 
instead of coming toward us,” 
he said, as he primed 1 his flames 
and set an adjustment which 
brought cross-hairs into focus on 
his rearview screen. 

£ CTTThat’s that?” she asked. 

¥ V “That’s a cross. I’m go- 
ing to crucify them, lady,” and 
she smiled at this and squeezed 
his arm. 

“Can I help? I hate those 
bloody mothers.” 

“In a little while,” said Tanner. 
“In a little while, I’m sure,” and 
he reached into the rear seat and 
fetched out the six hand grenades 
and hung them on his wide, black 
belt. He passed 1 the rifle to the 
girl. “Hang onto this,” he said, 
and stuck the .45 behind 1 his belt. 

“Do you know how to use that 
thing?”

67 


“Yes,” she replied immediately. 

“Good.” 

He kept watching the lights 
that danced on the screen. 

“Why the hell doesn’t this 
storm break?” he said, as the 
lights came closer and he could 
make out shapes within the fog. 

When they were within a hun- 
dred feet he fired the first gren- 
ade. It arched through the gray 
air, and five seconds later there 
was a bright flash to his rear, 
burning within a thunderclap. 

The lights immediately behind 
him remained, and he touched 
the fifty-calibers, moving the 
crosshairs from side to side. The 
guns shattered their loud sylla- 
bles, and he launched another 
grenade. With the second flash, 
he began to climb another hill. 

“Did you stop them?” 

“For a time, maybe. I still see 
some lights, but farther back.” 

After five minutes, they had 
reached the top, a place where 
the fogs were cleared and the 
dark sky was visible above them. 
Then they started downward 
once more, and a wall of stone 
and shale and dirt rose to their 
right. Tanner considered it as 
they descended. 

When the road leveled and he 
decided they had reached the 
bottom, he turned on his bright- 
est lights and looked for a place 
where the road’s shoulders were 
wide. 


To his rear, there were sudden- 
ly rows of descending lights. 

He found the place where the 
road was sufficiently wide, and 
he skidded through a U turn un- 
til he was facing the shaggy cliff, 
now to his left, and his pursuers 
were coming dead on. 

He elevated his rockets, fired 
one, elevated them five degrees 
more, fired two, elevated them 
another five degrees, fired three. 
Then he lowered them fifteen 
and fired another. 

There were brightnesses within 
the fog, and he heard the stones 
rattling on the road and felt the 
vibration as the rockslide began. 
He swung toward his right as he 
backed the vehicle and fired two 
ahead. There was dust mixed 
with the fog now, and the vibra- 
tion continued. 

He turned and headed forward 
once more. 

“I hope that’ll hold ’em,” he 
said, and he lit two cigarettes and 
passed one to the girl. 

A fter five minutes they were on 
higher ground again and tire 
winds came and whipped at the 
fog, and far to the rear there were 
still some lights. 

As they topped a high rise, his 
radiation gauge began to register 
an above-normal reading. He 
sought in all directions and saw 
the crater far off ahead. “That’s 
it,” he heard her say. “You’ve 


68 


GALAXY 


got to leave the road there. Bear 
to the right and go around that 
way when you get there.” 

“I’ll do that thing.” 

He heard gunshots from behind 
him, for the first time that day, 
and though he adjusted the cross- 
hairs he did not fire his own 
weapons. The distance was still 
too great. 

“You must have cut them in 
half,” she said, staring into the 
screen. “More than that. They’re 
a tough bunch, though.” 

“I gather,” and he plowed the 
field of mists and checked his 
supply of grenades for the 
launcher and saw that he was 
running low. 

He swung off the road to his 
right when he began bumping 
along over fractured concrete. 
The radiation level was quite 
high by then. The crater was 
slightly more than a thousand 
yards to his left. 

The lights to his rear fanned 
out, grew brighter. He drew a 
bead on the brightest and fired. 
It went out. 

“There’s another down,” he re- 
marked, as they raced across the 
hard-baked plain. 

The rains came more heavily, 
and he sighted on another light 
and fired. It, too, went out. Now, 
though he heard the sounds of 
their weapons about him once 
again. 

He switched to his right-hand 


guns and saw the cross-hairs leap 
into life on that screen. As three 
vehicles moved in to flank him 
from that direction, he opened up 
and cut them down. There was 
more firing at his back, and he 
ignored it as he negotiated the 
way. 

“I count twenty-seven lights,” 
Cornelia said. 

Tanner wove his way across a 
field of boulders. He lit another 
cigarette. 

Five minutes later, they were 
running on both sides of him. He 
had held back again for that mo- 
ment, to conserve ammunition 
and to be sure of his targets. He 
fired then, though, at every light 
within range, and he floored the 
accelerator and swerved around 
rocks. 

“Five of them are down,” she 
said, but he was listening to the 
gunfire. 

He launched a grenade to the 
rear, and when he tried to launch 
a second there came only a click- 
ing sound from the control. He 
launched one to either side and 
then paused for a second. 

“If they get close enough, I’ll 
show them some fire,” he said, 
and they continued on around 
the crater. 

He fired only at individual 
targets then, when he was certain 
they were within range. He took 
two more before he struck the 
broken roadbed.

6 6 T<T eep runn > n g parallel to it,” 
she told him. “There’s a 
trail here. Y ou can’t drive on that 
stuff till another mile or so.” 
Shots ricocheted from off his 
armored sides, and he continued 
to return the fire. He raced along 
an alleyway of twisted trees, like 
those he had seen near other cra- 
ters, and the mists hung like pen- 
nons about their brances. He 
heard the rattle of the increasing 
rains. 

When we hit the roadway once 
again, he regarded the lights to 
his rear and asked, “How many 
do you count now?” 

“It looks -like around twenty. 
How are we doing?” 

“I’m just worried about the 
tires. They can take a lot, but 
they can be shot out. The only 
other thing that bothers me is 
that a stray shot might clip one 
of the ‘eyes.’ Outside of that 
we’re bullet-proof enough. Even 
if they manage to stop us, they’ll 
have to pry us out.” 

The bikes drew near once 
again, and he saw the bright 
flashes and heard the reports of 
the riders’ guns. 

“Hold tight,” he said, and he 
hit the brakes and they skidded 
on the wet pavement. 

The lights grew suddenly 
bright, and he unleashed his rear 
flame. As some bikes skirted him, 
he cut in the side flames and 
held them that way. 

70 


Then he took his foot off the 
brake and floored the accelerator 
without waiting to assess the 
damage he had done. 

They sped ahead, and Tanner 
heard Cornelia’s laughter. 

“God! You’re taking them, 
Hell! You’re faking the whole 
damn club!” 

“It ain’t that much fun,” he 
said. Then, “See any lights?” 
She watched for a time, said, 
“No,” then said, “Three,” then, 
“Seven,” and finally, “Thirteen.” 
Tanner said, “Damn.” 

The radiation level fell and 
there came crashes amid the 
roaring overhead. A light fall of 
gravel descended for perhaps 
half a minute, along with the 
rain. 

“We’re running low,” he said. 
“On what?” 

“Everything : Luck, fuel, am- 
mo. Maybe you’d have been bet- 
ter off if I’d left you where I 
found you.” 

“No,” she said. “I’m with you, 
the whole line.” 

“Then you’re nuts,” lie said. “I 
haven’t been hurt yet. When I 
am, it might be a different tune.” 
“Maybe,” She said. “Wait and 
hear how I sing.” 

He reached out and squeezed 
her thigh. 

“Okay, Corny. You’ve been 
okay so far. Hang onto that piece, 
and we’ll see what happens.” 

He reached for another ciga- 

GALAXY 


rette, found the pack empty, 
cursed. He gestured toward a 
compartment, and she opened it 
and got him a fresh pack. She 
tore it open and lit him one. 

“Thanks.” 

“Why’re they staying out of 
range?” 

“Maybe they’re just going to 
pace us. I don’t know.” 

r T A hen the fogs began to lift. By 
the time Tanner had finished 
his cigarette, the visibility had 
improved greatly. He could make 
out the dark forms crouched atop 
their bikes, following, following, 
nothing more. 

“If they just want to keep us 
company, then I don’t care,” he 
said. “Let them.” 

But there came more gunfire 
after a time, and he heard a tire 
go. He slowed, but continued. He 
took careful aim and strafed 
them. Several fell. 

More gunshots sounded from 
behind. Another tire blew, and 
he hit the brakes and skidded, 
turning about as he slowed. When 
he faced them, he shot his an- 
chors, to hold him in place, and 
he discharged his rockets, one 
after another, at a level parallel 
to the road. He opened up with 
his guns and sprayed them as 
they veered off and approached 
him from the sides. Then he 
opened fire to the left. Then the 
right. 


He emptied the right-hand 
guns, then switched back to the 
left. He launched the remaining 
grenades. 

The gunfire died down, except 
for five sources — three to his 
left and two to his right — com- 
ing from somewhere within the 
trees that lined the road now. 
Broken bikes and bodies lay be- 
hind him, some still smouldering. 
The pavement was potted and 
cracked in many places. 

He turned the car and proceed- 
ed ahead on six wheels. 

“We’re out of ammo, Corny,” 
he told her. 

“Well, we took an awful lot of 
them . .” 

“Yeah.” 

As he drove on, he saw five 
bikes move onto the road. They 
stayed a good distance behind 
him, but they stayed. 

He tried the radio, but there 
was no response. He hit the 
brakes and stopped, and the 
bikes stopped, too, staying well 
to the rear. 

“Well, at least they’re scared 
of us. They think we still have 
teeth.” 

“We do,” she said. 

“Yeah, but not the ones they’re 
thinking about.” 

“Better yet.” 

“Glad I met you,” said Tanner. 
“I can use an optimist. There 
must be a pony, huh?” 

She nodded; he put it into gear 


DAMNATION ALLEY 


71 


and started forward abruptly. 

The motorcycles moved ahead 
also, and they maintained a safe 
distance. Tanner watched_them in 
the screens and cursed them as 
they followed. 

After awhile they drew nearer 
again. Tanner roared on for half 
an hour, and the remaining five 
edged closer and closer. 

X "ff Then they drew near enough, 
’ ’ they began to fire, rifles 
resting on their handlebars. 

Tanner heard several low rico- 
chets, and then another tire went 
out. 

He stopped once more, and the 
bikes did, too, remaining just out 
of range of his flames. He cursed 
and ground ahead again. The 
car wobbled as he drove, listing 
to ' the left. A wrecked pickup 
truck stood smashed against a 
tree to his right, its hunched 
driver a skeleton, its windows 
smashed and tires missing. Half 
a sun now stood in the heavens, 
reaching after nine o’clock; fog- 
ghosts drifted before them, and 
the dark band in the sky undulat- 
ed, and more rain fell from it, 
mixed with dust and small stones 
and bits of metal. Tanner said, 
“Good” as the pinging sounds be- 
gan, and, “Hope it gets a lot 
worse,” and his wish came true 
as the ground began to shake and 
tiie blue light began in the north. 
There came a booming within 

72 


the roar, and there were several 
answering crashes as heaps of 
rubble appeared to his right. 
“Hope the next one falls right on 
our buddies back there,” he said. 

He saw an orange glow ahead 
and to his right. It had been 
there for several minutes, but he 
had not become conscious of it 
until just then. 

“Volcano,” she said when he 
indicated it. “It means we’ve got 
another sixty-five, seventy miles 
to go.” 

He could not tell whether any 
more shooting was occurring. The 
sounds coming from overhead 
and around him were sufficient 
to mask any gunfire, and the fall 
of gravel upon the car covered 
any ricocheting rounds. The five 
headlights to his rear maintained 
their pace. 

“Why don’t they give up?” he 
said. “They’re taking a pretty 
bad beating.” 

“They’re used to it,” she re- 
plied, “and they’re riding for 
blood, which makes a difference.” 

Tanner fetched the .357, Mag- 
num from the door clip and 
passed it to her. “Hang onto this, 
too,” he said, and he found a box 
of ammo in the second compart- 
ment and, “Put these in your 
pocket,” he added. He stuffed 
ammo for the .45 into his own 
jacket. He adjusted the hand 
grenades upon his belt. 

Then the five headlights be- 

GALAXY 


hind him suddenly became four, 
and the others slowed, grew 
smaller. “Accident, I hope,” he 
remarked. 

They sighted the mountain, a 
jag-topped cone bleeding fires 
upon the sky. They left the road 
and swung far to the left, upon 
a well marked trail. It took twen- 
ty minutes to pass the mountain, 
and by then he sighted their pur- 
suers once again — four lights 
to the rear, gaining slowly. 

He came upon the road once 
more and hurried ahead across 
the shaking ground. The yellow 
lights moved through the heav- 
ens; and heavy, shapeless objects, 
some several feet across, crashed 
to the earth about them. The 
car was buffeted by winds, listed 
as they moved, would not pro- 
ceed above forty miles an hour. 
The radio contained only static. 

Tanner rounded a sharp curve, 
hit the brake, turned off his 
lights, pulled the pin from a hand 
grenade and waited with his hand 
upon the door. 

'IXThen the lights appeared in 
’ ’ the screen, he flung the 
door wide, leaped down and hurl- 
ed the grenade through the abras- 
ive rain. 

He was into the cab and mov- 
ing again before he heard the 
explosion, before the flash ac- 
curred upon his screen. 

The girl laughed almost hyster- 


ically as the car moved ahead, 

“You got ’em, Hell, You got 
’em!” she cried. 

Tanner took a drink from her 
flask, and she finished its final 
brown mouthful. He lit them cig- 
arettes: 

The road grew cracked, pitted, 
slippery. They topped a high rise 
and headed downhill. The fog 
thickened as they descended. 

Lights appeared before him, 
and he readied the flame. There 
were no hostilities, however, as 
he passed a truck headed in the 
other direction. Within the next 
half hour he passed two more. 

There came more lightning, 
and fist-sized rocks began to fall. 
Tanner left the road and sought 
shelter within a grove of high 
trees. The sky grew completely 
black, losing even its blue aurora. 

They waited for three hours, 
but the storm did not let up. One 
by one, the four view-screens 
went dead and the fifth only 
showed the blackness beneath 
the car. Tanner’s last sight in the 
rearview screen was of a huge 
splintered tree with a broken, 
swaying branch that was about 
ready to fall off. There were sev- 
eral terrific crashes upon the 
hood and tire car shook with 
each. The roof above their heads 
was deeply dented in three places. 
The lights grew dim, then bright 
again. The radio would not pro- 
duce even static any more. 


DAAANATION ALLEY

“I think we’ve had it,” 'he said. 
“Yeah.” 

“How far are we?” 

“Maybe fifty miles away.” 
“There’s still a chance, if we 
live through this.” 

“What chance?” 

“I’ve got two bikes in the 
rear.” 

They reclined their seats and 
smoked and waited, and after 
awhile the lights went out. 

The storm continued all that 
day and into the night. They 
slept within the broken body of 
the car, and it sheltered them. 
When the storm ceased, Tanner 
opened the door and looked out- 
side, closed it again. 

“We’ll wait til morning,” he 


74 


GALAXY 


said, and she held his Hell-print- 
ed hand, and they slept. 

XVI 

I n the morning, Tanner walked 
back through the mud and the 
fallen branches, the rocks and the 
dead fishes, and he opened the 
rear compartment and unbolted 
the bikes. He fueled them and 
checked them out and wheeled 
them down the ramp. 

He crawled into the back of 
the cab then and removed the 
rear seat. Beneath it, in the stor- 
age compartment, was the large 
aluminum chest that was his car- 
go. It was bolted shut. He lifted 
it, carried it out to his bike. 



“That the stuff?” she asked. 

He nodded and placed it on 
the ground. 

“I don’t know how the stuff is 
stored, if it’s refrigerated in there 
or what,” he said, “but it ain’t 
too heavy that I might not be 
able to get it on the back of my 
bike. There’s straps in the far 
right compartment. Go get ’em 
and give me a hand — and get 
me my pardon out of the middle 
compartment. It’s in a big card- 
board envelope.” 

She returned with these things 
and helped him secure the con- 
tainer on the rear of his bike. 

He wrapped extra straps 
around his left bicep, and they 
wheeled the machines to the 
road. 

“We’ll have to take it kind of 
slow,” he said, and he slung the 
rifle over his right shoulder, drew 
on his gloves and kicked his bike 
to life. 

She did the same with hers, and 
they moved forward, side by side 
along the highway. 

After they had been riding for 
perhaps an hour, two cars passed 
them, heading west. In the rear 
seats of both there were children, 
who pressed their faces to the 
glass and watched them as they 
went by. The driver of the second 
car was in his shirtsleeves, and he 
wore a black shoulder holster. 

The sky was pink, and there 
were three black lines that looked 


DAMNATION ALLEY 


75 


as if they could be worth worry- 
ing about. The sun was a rose- 
tinted silvery thing, and pale, 
but Tanner still had to raise his 
goggles against it. 

The pack was riding securely, 
and Tanner leaned into the dawn 
and thought about Boston. There 
was a light mist on the foot of 
every hill, and the air was cool 
and moist. Another car passed 
them. The road surface began to 
improve. 

I t was around noontime when 
he heard the first shot above 
the thunder of their engines. At 
first he thought it was a back- 
fire, but it came again, and Corny 
cried out and swerved off the 
road and struck a boulder. 

Tanner cut to the left, braking, 
as two more shots rang about 
him, and he leaned his bike 
against a tree and threw himself 
flat. A shot struck near his head 
and he could tell the direction 
from which it had come. He 
crawled into a ditch and drew 
off his right glove. He could see 
his girl lying where she had fallen, 
and there was blood on her 
breast. She did not move. 

He raised the 30.06 and fired. 
The shot was returned, and he 
moved to his left. 

It had come from a hill about 
two hundred feet away, and he 
thought he saw the rifle’s barrel. 
He aimed at it and fired again. 


The shot was returned, and he 
wormed his way further left. He 
crawled perhaps fifteen feet until 
he reached a pile of rubble he 
could crouch behind. Then he 
pulled the pin on a grenade, 
stood and hurled it. 

He threw himself flat as anoth- 
er shot rang out, and he took 
another grenade into his hand. 

There was a roar and a rumble 
and a mighty flash, and the junk 
fell about him as he leaped to 
his feet and threw the second 
one, taking better aim this time. 

After the second explosion, he 
ran forward with his rifle in his 
hands, but it wasn’t necessary. 

He only found a few small 
pieces of the man, and none at 
all of his rifle. 

He returned to Cornelia. 

She wasn’t breathing, and her 
heart had stopped beating, and he 
knew what that meant. 

He carried her back to the 
ditch in which he had lain and he 
made it deeper by digging, using 
his hands. 

He laid her down in it and he 
covered her with the dirt. Then 
he wheeled her machine over, set 
the kickstand, and stood it upon 
the grave. With his knife, he 
scratched upon the fender: Her 
name was Cornelia and I don't 
know how old she was or where 
she came from or what her last 
name was but she was Hell Tan- 
ner’s girl and I love her Then he

went back to his own machine, 
started it and drove ahead. Bos- 
ton was maybe thirty miles away. 

XVII 

Ti e drove along, and after a 
time he heard the sound of 
another bike. A Harley cut onto 
the road from the dirt path to 
his left, and he couldn’t try run- 
ning away from it because he 
couldn’t speed with the load he 
bore. So he allowed himself to 
be paced. 

After awhile, the rider of the 
other bike — a tall, thin man 
with a flaming beard — drew up 
alongside him, to the left. He 
smiled and raised his right hand 
and let it fall and then gestured 
with his head. 

Tanner braked and came to a 
halt. Redbeard was right beside 
him when he did. He said, 
“Where you going, man?” 

“Boston.” 

“What you got in the box?” 

“Like, drugs.” 

“What kind?” and the man’s 
eyebrows arched and the smile 
came again onto his lips. 

“For the plague they got going 
there.” 

“Oh. I thought you meant the 
other kind.” “Sorry.” 

The man held a pistol in his 
right hand and he said, “Get off 
your bike.” 

Tanner did this, and the man 


raised his left hand and another 
man came forward from the 
brush at the side of the road. 
“Wheel this guy’s bike about two 
hundred yards up the highway,” 
he said, “and park it in the mid- 
dle. Then take your place.” 
“What’s the bit?” Tanner 
asked. 

The man ignored the question. 
“Who are you?” he asked. 

“Hell’s the name,” he replied. 
“Hell Tanner.” 

“Go to hell.” 

Tanner shrugged. 

“You ain’t Hell Tanner.” 
Tanner drew off his right glove 
and extended his fist. 

“There’s my name.” 

“I don’t believe it,” said the 
man, after he had studied the 
tattoo. 

“Have it your way, citizen.” 
“Shut up!” and he raised his 
left hand once more, now that the 
other man had parked the ma- 
chine on the road and returned 
to a place somewhere within the 
trees to the right. 

In response to his gesture, there 
was movement within the brush. 

Bikes were pushed forward by 
their riders, and they lined the 
road, twenty or thirty on either 
side. 

“There you are,” said the man. 
“My name’s Big Brother.” 

“Glad to meet you.” 

“You know what you’re going 
to do, mister?” 


DAMNATION ALLEY 


77 


“I can really just about guess.” 

“You’re going to walk up to 
your bike and claim it.” 

Tanner smiled. 

“How hard’s that going to be?” 

“No trouble at all. Just start 
walking. Give me your rifle first, 
though.” 

Big Brother raised his hand 
again, and one by one the engines 
came to life. 

“Okay,” he said. “Now.” 

“You think I’m crazy, man?” 

“No. Start walking. Your rifle.” 

npanner unslung it and he con- 
tinued the arc. He caught Big 
Brother beneath his red beard, 
and he felt the bullet go into him. 
Then he dropped the weapon and 
hauled forth a grenade, pulled 
the pin and tossed it amid the 
left side of the gauntlet. Before 
it exploded, he’d pulled the pin 
on another and thrown it to his 
right. By then, though, vehicles 
were moving forward, heading 
toward him. 

He fell upon the rifle and 
shouldered it in a prone firing 
position. As he did this, the first 
explosion occurred. He was fir- 
ing before the second one went 
off. 

He dropped three of them, then 
got to his feet and scrambled, 
firing from the hip. 

He made it behind Big Broth- 
er’s fallen bike and fired from 
there. Big Brother was still fallen, 


too. When the rifle was empty, 
he didn’t have time to reload. He 
fired the .45 four times before a 
tire chain brought him down. 

He awoke to the roaring of the 
engines. They were circling him. 
When he got to his feet, a handle- 
bar knocked him down again. 

Two bikes were moving about 
him, and there were many dead 
people upon the road. 

He struggled to rise again, was 
knocked off his feet. 

Big Brother rode one of the 
bikes, and a guy he hadn’t seen 
rode the other. 

He crawled to the right, and 
there was pain in his fingertips 
as the tires passed over them. 

But he saw a rock and waited 
till a driver was near. Then he 
stood again and threw himself 
upon the man as he passed, the 
rock he had seized rising and 
falling, once, in his right hand. 
He was carried along as this oc- 
curred, and as he fell he felt the 
second bike strike him. 

There were terrible pains in his 
side, and his body felt broken, 
but he reached out even as this 
occurred and caught hold of a 
strut on the side of the bike and 
was dragged along by it. 

Before he had been dragged 
ten feet, he had drawn his SS 
dagger from his boot. He struck 
upward and felt a thin metal wall 
give way. Then his hands came 
loose, and he fell and he smelled

the gasoline. His hand dove into 
his jacket pocket and came out 
with the Zippo. 

He had struck the tank on the 
side of Big Brother’s bike, and it 
jetted forth its contents on the 
road. Twenty feet ahead, Big 
Brother was turning. 

Tanner held the lighter, the 
lighter with the raised skull of 
enamel, wings on either side of 
it. His thumb spun the wheel and 
the sparks leapt forth, then the 
flame. He tossed it into the 
stream of petrol that lay before 
him, and the flames raced away, 
tracing a blazing trail upon the 
concrete. 

Big Brother had turned and 
was bearing down upon him when 
he saw what had happened. His 
eyes widened, and his red-framed 
smile went away. 

He tried to leap off his bike, 
but it was too late. 

The exploding gas tank caught 
him, and he went down with a 
piece of metal in his head and 
other pieces elsewhere. 

Flames splashed over Tanner, 
and he beat at them feebly with 
his hands. 

He raised his head above the 
blazing carnage and let it fall 
again. He was bloody and weak 
and so very tired. He saw his own 
machine, standing still undamag- 
ed on the road ahead. 

He began crawling toward it. 

When he reached it, he threw 


himself across the saddle and lay 
there for perhaps ten minutes. He 
vomited twice, and his pains be- 
came a steady pulsing. 

After perhaps an hour, he 
mounted the bike and brought it 
to life. 

He rode for half a mile and 
then dizziness and the fatigue hit 
him. 

He pulled off to the side of the 
road and concealed his bike as 
best he could. Then he lay down 
upon the bare earth and slept. 

XVIII 

en he awoke, he felt dried 
blood upon his side. His 
left hand ached and was swollen. 
All four fingers felt stiff, and it 
hurt to try to bend them. His 
head throbbed and there was a 
taste of gasoline within his 
mouth. He was too sore to move, 
for a long while. His beard had 
been singed, and his right eye 
was swollen almost shut. 

“Corny . .” he said, then, 
“Damn!” 

Everything came back, like the 
contents of a powerful dream 
suddenly spilled into his con- 
sciousness. 

He began to shiver, and there 
were mists all around him. It 
was very dark, and his legs were 
cold; the dampness had soaked 
completely through his denims. 

In the distance, he heard a ve- 



DAMNATION ALLEY 


79 


hide pass. It sounded like a car. 

He managed to roll over, and 
he rested his head on his forearm. 
It seemed to be night, but it 
could be a black day. 

As he lay there, his mind went 
back to his prison cell. It seemed 
almost a haven now; and he 
thought of his brother Denny, 
Who must also be hurting at this 
moment. He wondered if he had 
any cracked ribs himself. It felt 
like it. And he thought of the 
monsters of the southwest and of 
dark-eyed Greg, who had tried to 
chicken out. Was he still living? 
His mind circled back to L.A. and 
the old Coast, gone, gone forever 
now, after the Big Raid. Then 
Corny walked past him, blood 
upon her breasts, and he chewed 
his beard and held his eyes shut 
very tight. They might have 
made it together in Boston. How 
far, now? 

He got to his knees and crawl- 
ed until he felt something high 
and solid. A tree. He. sat with his 
back to it, and his hand sought 
the crumpled cigarette pack 
within his jacket. He drew one 
forth, smoothed it, then remem- 
bered that his lighter lay some- 
where back on the highway. He 
sought through his pockets and 
found a damp matchbook. The 
third one lit. The chill went out 
of his bones as he smoked, and 
a wave of fever swept over him. 
He coughed as he was unbutton- 


ing his collar, and it seemed that 
he tasted blood. 

His weapons were gone, save 
for the lump of a single grenade 
at his belt. 

Above him, in the darkness, he 
heard the roaring. After six puffs, 
the cigarette slipped from his fin- 
gers and sizzled out upon the 
damp mold. His head fell for- 
ward, and there was darkness 
within. 

There might have been a storm. 
He didn’t remember. When he 
awoke, he was lying on his right 
side, the tree to his back. A pink 
afternoon sun shone down upon 
him, and the mists were blown 
away. From somewhere, he heard 
the sound of a bird. He managed 
a curse, then realized how dry 
his throat was. He was suddenly 
burnt with a terrible thirst. 

There was a clear puddle about 
thirty feet away. He crawled to 
it and drank his fill. It grew 
muddy as he did so. 

Then he crawled to where his 
bike lay hidden and stood be- 
side it. He managed to seat him- 
self upon it, and his hands shook 
as he lit a cigarette. 

I t must have taken him an hour 
to reach the roadway, and he 
was panting heavily by then. His 
watch had been broken, so he 
didn’t know the hour. The sun 
was already lowering at his back 
when he started out. The winds 


80 


GALAXY 


whipped about him, insulating his 
consciousness within their burn- 
ing flow. His cargo rode securely 
behind him. He had visions of 
someone opening it and finding 
a batch of broken bottles. He 
laughed and cursed, alternately. 

Several cars passed him, head- 
ing in the other direction. He had 
not seen any heading toward the 
city. The road was in good con- 
dition and he began to pass 
buildings that seemed in a good 
state of repair, though deserted. 
He did not stop. This time he de- 
termined not to stop for any- 
thing, unless he was stopped. 

The sun fell farther, and the 
sky dimmed before him. There 
were two black lines swaying in 
the heavens. Then he passed a 
sign that told him he had 18 
miles farther to go. Ten minutes 
later he switched on his light. 

Then he topped a hill and 
slowed before he began its de- 
scent. 

There were lights below him 
and in the distance. 

As he rushed forward, the 
winds brought to him the sound 
of a single bell, tolling over and 
over within the gathering dark. 
He sniffed a remembered thing 
upon the air: it was the salt-tang 
of the sea. 

The sun was hidden behind the 
hill as he descended, and he rode 
within the endless shadow. A 
single star appeared on the far 


horizon, between the two black 
belts. 

Now there were lights within 
shadows that he passed, and the 
buildings moved closer together. 
He leaned heavily on the handle- 
bars, and the muscles of his 
shoulders smouldered beneath his 
jacket. He wished that he had a 
crash helmet, for he felt increas- 
ingly unsteady. 

He must almost be there. 
Where would he head once he 
hit the city proper? They had not 
told him that. 

He shook his head to clear it. 

The street he drove along was 
deserted. There were no traffic 
sounds that he could hear. He 
blew his horn, and its echoes roll- 
ed back upon him. 

There was a light on in the 
building to his left. 

He pulled to a stop, crossed 
the sidewalk and banged on the 
door. There was no response from 
within. He tried the door and 
found it locked. A telephone 
would mean he could end his 
trip right there. 

What if they were all dead in- 
side? The thought occurred to 
him that just about everybody 
could be dead by now. He de- 
cided to break in. He returned to 
his bike for a screwdriver, then 
went to work on the door. 

He heard the gunshot and the 
sound of the engine at approxi- 
mately the same time.

T Te turned around quickly, his 
back against the door, the 
hand grenade in his gloved right 

fist. 

“Hold it!” called out a loud- 
speaker on the side of the black 
car that approached. “That shot 
was a warning! The next one 
won’t be!” 

Tanner raised his hands to a 
level with his ears, his right one 
turned to conceal the grenade. 
He stepped forward to the curb 
beside his bike when the car drew 
up. 

There were two officers in the 
car, and the one on the pas- 
senger side held a .38 pointed at 
Tanner’s middle. 

“You’re under arrest,” he said. 
“Looting.” 

Tanner nodded as the man 
stepped out of the car. The driv- 
er came around the front of the 
vehicle, a pair of handcuffs in 
his hand. 

“Looting,” the man with the 
gun repeated. “You’ll pull a real 
stiff sentence.” 

“Stick your hands out here, 
boy,” said the second cop, and 
Tanner handed him the grenade 
pin. 

The man stared at it, dumbly, 
for several seconds, then his eyes 
shot to Tanner’s right hand. 

“God! He’s got a bomb!” said 
the man with the gun. 

Tanner smiled, then, “Shut up 
and listen!” he said. “Or else 


shoot me and we’ll all go to- 
gether when we go. I was try- 
ing to get to a telephone. That 
case on the back of my bike is 
full of Haffikine antiserum. I 
brought it from L.A.” 

“You didn’t run the Alley on 
that bike!” 

“No, I didn’t. My car is dead 
somewhere between here and Al- 
bany, and so are a lot of folks 
who tried to stop me. Now you 
better take that medicine and 
get it where it’s supposed to go.” 
“You on the level, mister?” 
“My hand is getting very 
tired. I am not in good shape.” 
Tanner leaned on his bike. 
“Here.” 

He pulled his pardon out of 
his jacket and handed it to the 
officer with the handcuffs. 
“That’s my pardon,” he said. 
“It’s dated just last week and 
you can see it was made out in 
California.” 

The officer took the envelope 
and opened it. He withdrew the 
paper and studied it. “Looks 
real,” he said. “So Brady made 
it through ...” 

“He’s dead,” Tanner said. 
“Look, I’m hurtin’. Do some- 
thing!” 

“My God! Hold it tight! Get 
in the car and sit down! It’ll just 
take a minute to get the case 
off and we’ll roll. We’ll drive 
to the river and you can throw 
it in. Squeeze real hard!”

nphey unfastened the case and 
put it in the back of the car. 
They rolled down the right front 
window, and Tanner sat next to 
it with his arm on the outside. 

The siren screamed, and the 
pain crept up Tanner’s arm to his 
Shoulder. It would be very easy 
to let go. 

“Where do you keep you riv- 
er?” he asked. 

“Just a little farther. We’ll be 
there in no time.” 

“Hurry,” Tanner said. 

“That’s the bridge up ahead. 
We’ll ride out onto it, and you 
throw it off — as far out as you 
can.” 

“Man, I’m tired! I’m not sure 
I can make it . .” 

“Hurry, Jerry!” 

“I am, damn it!. We ain’t got 
wings!” 

“I feel kind of dizzy, too . .” 

They tore out onto the bridge, 
and the tires screeched as they 
halted. Tanner opened the door 
slowly. The driver’s had already 
slammed shut. 

He staggered, and they helped 
him to the railing. He sagged 
against it when they released 
him. 

“I don’t think I — ” 

Then he straightened, drew 
back his arm and hurled the 
grenade far out over the waters. 


He grinned, and the explosion 
followed, far beneath them, and 
for a time the waters were trou- 
bled. 

The two officers sighed and 
Tanner chuckled. 

“I’m really okay,” he said. “I 
just faked it to bug you.” 

“Why you — !” 

Then he collapsed, and they 
saw the pallor of his face within 
the beams of their lights. 

XIX 

np'he following spring, on the 
day of its unveiling in Bos- 
ton Common, when it was dis- 
covered that someone had 
scrawled obscene words on the 
statue of Hell Tanner, no one 
thought to ask the logical candi- 
date why he had done it, and the 
next day it was too late, because 
he had cut out without leaving 
a forwarding address. Several 
cars were reported stolen that 
day, and one was never seen 
again in Boston. 

So they re-veiled his statue, 
bigger than life, astride a great 
bronze Harley, and they cleaned 
him up for hoped-for posterity. 
But coming upon the Common, 
the winds still break about him 
and the heavens still throw gar- 
bage. —ROGER ZELAZNY

places. Comet fear was, surpris- 
ing as it may sound, restricted 
to the Christian countries be- 
cause it was part of Christian be- 
liefs. 

Like everything else comet fear 
grew up slowly; it reached its 
climax during the years from 
1200 to 1650, when professors of 


Christian philosophy taught 
things that one would think to 
have been mere folklore among 
the illiterates of that period. I 
happen to have a beautiful ex- 
ample on hand, a 24-page pam- 
phlet published in Frankfurt am 
Main in 1619, one year after the 
appearance of the comet of 1618.

Gotthard Arthusius, the author 
of title pamphlet, began with the 
assertion that the final battle 
against evil and the Day of 
Judgment must certainly be ap- 
proaching. 

“But because the larger portion 
of mankind in the world commits 
evil without regret or hesitation, 
and lives carelessly in the belief 
that nobody will learn about their 
evil ways or even inquire about 
them; therefore the Son of God 
does not rely only on the might 
of his words but from time to 
time puts other preachers on the 
high pulpit of his heaven and 
causes signs and miracles in the 
sun, the moon and the stars and 
ignites many a bright light in the 
clouds in order to wake people 
from their sinful sleep .... We 
have seen such a sign in our time 
for Almighty God has put a cruel 
torch in the sky and shown us a 
Comet with a very long and 
burning tail.” 

Scientifically speaking, Arthusius 
^ believed with Aristotle that a 
comet consisted of burning “va- 
pors” in the upper air; but while 
Aristotle took the ignition of 
these vapors to be a natural pro- 
cess and probably accidental, the 
theologians, and especially the 
Protestant theologians of the era 
of comet fear, considered the ig- 
nition of these vapors to be liter- 
ally an act of God. 


“The Comet has been seen 
here,” Arthusius continued, “on 
18/28 November in the morning 
at 5 o’clock but before the Comet 
was ignited one did see a few 
rays in the morning sky in the 
precise place where the Comet- 
Star rose later and those rays 
might be compared to the mes- 
sengers preceding an important 
personage.” 

The figure “18/28” does not 
mean that the comet was visible 
from the 18th to the 28th of No- 
vember 1618; this was the time 
of transition from the Julian to 
the Gregorian calendar — it was 
November 18 to the adherents of 
the Julian calendar and Novem- 
ber 28 of the Gregorian calendar. 
The actual period of visibility 
was 27 days. Of course the “rays” 
were the comet’s tail that had 
happened to be visible first. 

“The Comet rose in Scorpio in 
the 12 th house, not far from the 
beautiful bright star named Spica 
virginis between which and Arc- 
turus it shot its rays in the direc- 
tion of the northern Pole . for 
the present moment one cannot 
really tell at which time it was 
first ignited . but I conclude 
for Astrological Reasons that it 
must have been the 26 Octob. of 
the Old, or 6 Novemb. of the New 
Calendar.” 

There follow about ten pages 
of calamities that were associated 
with comets: “From these and

from the Nuremberg chronicle for 
the year 684 A.D. This was one of 
the appearances of Halley's comet. 


This pamplet was written and 
printed at about the peak period 
of comet fear. But, as used to be 
said of fever, the peak was reach- 
ed just before the decline. By 
1700 thinking people had reached 
the conclusion that one could 
have bad weather, poor harvests, 
war and high prices without the 
aid of a comet. Theologians no 
longer pointed to comets as a sign 
that the end of the world was at 
hand; it had been done too often 
before. And astronomers by then 
knew that comets were not burn- 
ing vapors in the atmospheres but 
bodies in space far beyond the 
moon. (Fig. 2.) 


other examples it can be seen 
clearly that comets never appear- 
ed without great catastrophies.” 
If the good and pious burgher 
who bought the pamphlet ex- 
pected enlightenment about the 
specific catastrophies that were 
to come he was going to be dis- 
appointed. Arthusius merely 
warned that one of the signs of 
comet madness was “an insati- 
able craving for innovations” and 
said that morning comets show 
their actions soon, while the con- 
sequences of evening comets are 
more slow in coming. Generally 
comets presage “earthquakes, 
floods, changes in river courses, 
hail storms, hot and dry weather, 
poor harvests, epidemics, war and 
treason and high prices.” 


ft was during the early years of 
-1- the eighteenth century that Dr. 
Edmond Halley began collecting 
all the comet observations he 
could find in order to calculate 
their orbits. In compiling his list 
of the orbits of 24 “different” 
comets he noticed that four of 
these orbits, namely those of the 
comets of 1456, 1531, 1607 and 
1682, were the same, and he drew 
the conclusion that this must 
have been four appearances of 
the same comet that approached 
the sun every 75 years. If this 
was so, that comet should return 
in 1758 — which, as everybody 
now knows, it did. 

Halley’s list of 24 orbits was 
published in 1705, and others 
studied it with care in hopes of

finding another periodicity. The 
Rev. William Whiston, a learned 
Anglican theologian and philoso- 
pher thought that he did : the or- 
bits of the then recent great com- 
et of 1680, of the comet of 1106 
and that of 531 looked alike to 
him; the periodicity would be 
574 years. Halley had noticed 
that too, but had rejected the 
conclusion for several reasons; 
while there seemed to be a peri- 


odicity the orbits were not suffi- 
ciently alike. But Whiston went 
ahead — that comet must have 
been visible in 43 B.C., in 541 
B.C., in 1115 B.C., and so on, 
counting backward. And sudden- 
ly he saw that this comet had 
caused a catastrophe, in fact the 
catastrophe. He sat down and 
wrote a pamphlet with the title 
The Cause of the Deluge Demon- 
strated which appeared in 1711. 
After that he really went to work 
and expanded it into a 556-page 
book A New Theory of the Earth 
(Fig. 3.) It appeared in 1722 and 
in it rewrote the Book of Genesis. 

Whiston’s intention was to de- 
fend the Bible, specifically Gen- 
esis. But, he admitted, Genesis 
needs some explanation. While 
no doubt divinely inspired, the 
“sacred penman” wrote it so as 
to be understandable to the prim- 
itive agricultural Jews of his 
time. And because they were un- 
able to grasp the concept of the 
astronomical universe, the uni- 
verse is treated as it appears to 
men of this type, and Genesis 
deals with the creation of the 
earth only. Whiston felt no 
qualms in supposing that the uni- 
verse was already in existence 
when the Lord made Earth habit- 
able and created its animals and 
plants. 

I t is difficult to imagine a more 
repetitious and redundant 


100 


GALAXY 


piece of writing than this book; 
pruning the 556 pages down to 
about 300 pages would not only 
be easy, it would be an improve- 
ment. Still, in the space available 
here, I cannot repeat all his argu- 
ments. Only the highlights can 
be given, and any similarity to 
recent fantasies is coincidental. 

Whiston pointed out that the 
gases surrounding the nucleus of 
a comet appear to be highly agi- 
tated; this to him was a visible 
chaos, the original state of the 
earth. Obviously there was some 
connection between and comets, 
or, as he phrased it: 

“Tis very reasonable to believe, 
that a Planet is a Comet form’d 
into a regular and lasting Consti- 
tution, and plac’d at a proper 
distance from the Sun in a Circu- 
lar Orbit, or one very little Ec- 
centrical; and a Comet is a Cha- 
os, i.e., a Planet unform’d, or in 
its primaeval state, plac’d in a 
very Eccentrical one.” 

Hence the prelude of the crea- 
tion as described in Genesis must 
have consisted in making a comet 
assume about the orbit the Earth 
now has. But that planet to be 
did not yet rotate on its axis: 
“The Annual Motion of the 
Earth commenc’d at the begin- 
ning of the Mosaick Creation; 
yet its Diurnal Rotation did not 
till after the Fall of Man.” With 
this assumption Whiston made 
each of the days of creation one 


year long and he defended him- 
self against the reproach that he 
limited the power of the Creator. 
Of course, he said, the Lord, if 
He pleased, could have started 
and concluded the whole creation 
in one moment, but that is not 
what the Bible says. Moreover 
the soil is ordered to produce the 
plants; the seas are ordered to 
produce the creatures in them, 
and finally Adam is ordered to 
name the animals. The soil, the 
seas and Adam could not perform 
in an instant; they needed time. 

In 1722, when Whiston wrote 
his book, the time elapsed since 
the first day, that is year, of crea- 
tion was 5731 years, while 4070 
years had gone by since the first 
day of the deluge. During the 
sixteen and a half centuries be- 
tween creation and the deluge 
Mankind had multiplied enor- 
mously, because every individual 
lived for hundreds of years so 
that more than 500 million people 
perished When the deluge came. 
It was “on the 17th Day of the 
Second Month, from the Autum- 
nal Equinox, or November 28 in 
the 2349th Year before the Chris- 
tian Aera” that a great comet 
came close to the earth. When 
nearest its distance was 10,000 
miles “and itself a little less than 
a Quarter of the bigness of the 
Earth; or about 6 times so big 
as the Moon; two very probable 
and easy Hypotheses.”

I can’t find anything easy 
about this statement because the 
Rev. Whiston did not say what 
he meant by “bigness.” If he had 
diameters in mind, six times the 
“bigness” of the moon makes 
about 1-3/4 Earth diameter. If he 
meant volumes, six times the vol- 
ume of the moon is 31,560 million 
cubic miles which is only about 
0.12 the volume of the Earth — 
but let’s not quibble about the 
mathematics of spherical bodies. 



Fig. 4. Diagram of the orbit of "the Comet" 
from Whiston’s book. At that time 
Saturn was still the outermost known 
planet. 


4 t any event this comet was 
rich in water that poured 
down on the Earth; at the same 
time its gravitational attraction 
caused “all the fountains of the 
great deep” to open up. The ad- 
dition of the water and the gra- 
vitation of the comet had two 
other effects. Before the deluge 
the year lasted 360 days; but 
days slightly shorter than the 
days at present. The additional 
water lengthened the day, and 
the attraction of the comet 
changed the originally circular 
orbit of the earth into an ellipti- 
cal orbit Which takes 365-1/4 
days to complete. When the 
Earth is at perihelion early in 
January of each year — 91-1/2 
million miles from the sun — it 
touches its former orbit; when at 
aphelion it is 3 million miles 
farther from the sun. 

- The idea of the orbital change 
may have sounded convincing to 
Whiston’s contemporaries but as- 
tronomers could have asked a 
number of embarrassing ques- 
tions. One could calculate the or- 
bital period of a planet in a cir- 
cular orbit at Earth’s perihelion 
distance and compare the result 
with the actual orbital period of 
the earth. The difference is not 
5-1/4 days. And one could ask 
what happened to the orbit of the 
cbmet. Being the less massive of 
the two bodies its orbit would 
have been twisted violently and 


102 


GALAXY 


it would not have the orbit shown 
in Fig. 4. I don’t know whether 
anybody made that objection, 
but Whiston could have replied 
that the orbit of his presumed 
comet (with an orbital period of 
74 or 575 years) was the orbit 
that resulted from this encounter. 
An astronomer then could still 
have said that the orbit shown 
on the diagram would have a 
period of about 57.5 years and 
not 575 years. 

What Whiston really accom- 
plished with his book was a re- 
vival of comet fear for another 
century or so with a shift in em- 
phasis. Comets were no longer 
signs of catastrophies to come, 
they were a direct physical men- 
ace in themselves. Laymen were 
unaware of the fine points of as- 
tronomical measurements and of 
density calculations. To the lay- 
man something that looked big 
was big, and something that look- 
ed firey must be hot. 

I n 1781 Captain John Good- 
ridge, “late Commander of one 
of His Majesty’s Packet Boats 
Station’d at Falmouth”, took up 
the theme of that dreadful comet 
once more. The small book of 
only 74 pages had the title The 
Phoenix; and Captain Goodridge, 
heavily influenced by Whiston, 
stated its purpose in the first par- 
agraph : 

“My design in the following 


Essay is to show that a Comet 
has been the cause of two grand 
catastrophes that have happened 
to this our Earth, for the punish- 
ment of its inhabitants, at the 
Fall and at the Deluge; which 
Comet (it is my intention to 
prove as far as I am able) is the 
real Phoenix of the ancients.” 

Captain Goodridge accepted 
that the six days of creation were 
really six years, that the Earth 
moved along a circular orbit be- 
fore the deluge and that the 
comet caused the deluge. He 
added that “the foul chaotick 
matter drawn from [the comet’s] 
atmosphere filled the atmosphere 
of our earth with noxious vapours 
that made our air very unwhole- 
some, which soon reduced the life 
of man to its present standard.” 

According to Goodridge the 
comet not only produced the de- 
luge and the first known case of 
air pollution, it also had “at the 
time of Adam’s transgression” 
started the diurnal rotation of the 
earth, either by a very close ap- 
proach or even a glancing blow. 

Then Captain Goodridge, not 
having much to offer that had not 
been said by Whiston (whose 
book was out of print by then) 
proceeded to his pet theme. 

“The Phoenix is said to fee a 
bird about the size of an Eagle, 
and not much unlike one; that it 
returns once in nearly six hun- 
dred years, goes down to the Al-

tar of the Sun, is there burnt, 
and a young one springs out of 
its Ashes and flieth off again .... 
The Comet’s period’s are upon 
an Average about 575 years; this 
certainly agrees with the return 
of the Phoenix.” 

While Goodridge did not be- 
lieve that the phoenix could be a 
real bird he pointed at “the 
Comet’s going down to the Sun, 
where, by the violence of the 
Sun’s heat, it is terribly burnt, 
and when it returns, in flying off 
again, it is then called the young 
Phoenix; and let it be further 
observed that the Comet is of 
such a magnitude that it can be 
easily followed with the naked 
Eye either in its descent to, or 
assent (sic) from the Sun, all of 
Which duly considered, proves, I 
think beyond a doubt, that this 
Comet, and this only, is what 
has been called the Phoenix” 

Since the comet that caused the 
earth to rotate and later changed 
its orbit was last seen in 1680, it 
is due to return late in 2255 or 
early 2256. 

And then, said Goodridge, “it 
will be the cause of the general 
Conflagration and finishing off 
all things with respect to this 
Earth.” 

Well, that is the story of the 
worst of all the comets . which 
does not even exist in space, for 
the comet of 531, 1106 and 1680 
were not identical.

Addenda to the April, 1967, 
issue : 

/fy column in the April issue 
has brought me half a doz- 
en letters, five of them remark- 
ing on the table on page 57 and 
asking “whatever happened to 
geocoronium ?” 

As for that table I have to 
admit on behalf of the publisher, 
the editor and myself, that some- 
body did not read proof proper- 
ly. It should have looked like 
this: 


Number of days 
a comet was un- 
der observation: 


Number of or- 
bits found to be 
parabolic: 


1 - 99 days 
100-239 days 
240-511 days 


68 per cent 
55 per cent 
13 per cent 


As for the question about geo- 
coronium, my readers will re- 
member that a section of that 
column was caused by a letter 
asking “whatever became of vir- 
ginium?” It dealt with chemical 
elements of which the “discovery” 
was announced by somebody 
only to end up with a red face 
for one reason or another. Of 
course, “virginium,” “moldavi- 
um,” “alabamine” and so forth 
were elements on Earth, and I 
really should have added that 
there were also two such mistakes 
in the sky. One was called “neb- 


104 


GALAXY 


ulium” and the other “coron- 
ium.” “Nebulium” was supposed 
to be an element that could be 
found spectroscopically in the 
gaseous nebulae, while “coron- 
ium” had been discovered, also 
spectroscopically, in die sun’s 
corona. It is now known that 
neither “nebulium” nor “coron- 
ium” actually exist; what had 
looked like a strange element in 
the spectrogram were actually the 
lines of atoms of well known ele- 
ments at very high temperatures 
and an equally high degree of 
ionization. Some of the “coron- 
ium” lines have been identified 
as coming from ionized iron and 
calcium atoms. 

While the discovery of “cor- 
onium” was a simple case of 
misinterpretation, “geocoronium” 
was the result of misreasoning. 
About fifty years ago it was be- 
lieved that our atmosphere was 
strictly stratified. Near the 
ground you had the well known 


nitrogen -oxygen mixture, but at 
high altitude there would be 
comparatively less oxygen, since 
the oxygen molecule is a bit 
heavier than the nitrogen mole- 
cule. At the same altitude, it 
was thought, there should be an 
admixture of hydrogen atoms, 
the lightest atoms of all. Car- 
rying on this line of reasoning 
our atmosphere should have a 
top layer consisting of hydrogen 
atoms only, with helium atoms as 
an impurity. Now it was thought 
that the “coronium” of the sun 
was lighter than hydrogen, hence 
we might have a “coronium” lay- 
er above the hydrogen layer and 
in order to make it clear that 
this was the “coronium” of the 
earth it was called “geocoroni- 
um.” 

Actually our atmosphere is not 
stratified in that manner. There 
is no hydrogen layer at the top — 
and “geocoronium” doesn’t exist 
at all. —WILLY LEY

The Transmogrification 
Of Wamba's Revenge 

by H. L. GOLD 



Illustrated by 
MORROW 


I 

f A s I sit here, writing this, in a 
deluxe suite of the famous 
but resounding Waldorf-Astoria, 
I can look out the fourth-floor 
window and see the people below 
resembling the scurrying warrior 
ants of my native Africa. It was 
a Monday because the other 
married women were down at the 
river, beating their laundry on 


flat rocks, when Mr. Lundeen, the 
local White Hunter, came into 
our compound with a two-truck 
safari. 

“What cheer, Wamba?” he said 
to me in pidgin Pigmy. “Why you 
not at river wash clothes?” 

I nodded hello, ignoring his 
deliberate insult. He knew per- 
fectly well that I spoke English, 
having graduated from Benning- 
ton College for Women, and that, 


106 


as daughter of the Super Chief 
of All the Pigmies and No. 1 Wife 
of the Head Witch Doctor, I was 
exempt from menial tasks. 

“Me worry on you, Wamba,” 
he continued with his atrocious 
accent and the vocabulary of a 
retarded three-year-old, while 
climbing out of his Land Rover. 
“Me think you grow one or two 
inch since last time.” 

Oh, he was an expert needier! 
And he touched me at my proud- 
est spot. The women of all our 
tribes didn’t envy me my status, 
which they and I had grown up 
with, but there wasn’t one of 
them that wouldn’t maim herself 
to be my height — a good three 
inches shorter than any other 
full-grown Pigmy adult! It was 
difficult, but I kept silent. The 
tribe’s whole cash crop came from 
Lundeen’s safaris, and I mustn’t 
jeopardize it, no matter what. 

My father, the Super Chief, 
came out of the council hut, fol- 
lowed by my husband, the Head 
Witch Doctor, just as an oldish 
young man clambered down from 
the other vehicle and handed out 
a woman in jodhpurs. 

“Welcome! Welcome!” cried 
my father in English I had taught 
him with no little pain; he was a 
terrible linguist. “Great honor! 
Very great! Welcome!” 

My husband, the Head Witch 
Doctor, stood waiting for the in- 
troductions, and Lundeen obliged, 


using all the appropriate titles, 
including mine. The oldish young 
man was a Professor Todd, and 
the woman in jodhpurs was his 
wife. We shook hands all around, 
ours being small and dry, theirs 
being large and moist. 

“You come to hunt?” asked my 
father politely, using up the last 
of his English. 

“In a way,” said the Professor. 
“You’ve heard of penicillin, quin- 
ine, digitalis?” 

“Yes,” said my husband. “We 
use them all the time.” 

“Really?” Mrs. Todd said dis- 
interestedly. “No masks or danc- 
es to drive away evil spirits?” 
My husband’s eyes did not 
Waver an inch. “Of course. Faith 
is part of the healing process.” 
“Well,” the Professor said 
briskly, “I am here to look for 
more such species — in the soil, 
the barks, the berries, leaves — 
everything. I have a laboratory 
on wheels, and I do hope you 
people will help me in my search.” 
“What did he say?” the Super 
Chief asked. I translated and he 
said, “What’s in it for us?” 
“Honor,” said the Witch Doc- 
tor, and, “Whatever squeezes 
through my fingers,” said Lun- 
deen, both in Pigmy. Then, in 
pseudo-British/English, Lundeen 
said, “I say, Professor, Why don’t 
you show our royal hosts your 
laboratory while I show Mrs. 
Todd the compound?” 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


107 


“Splendid,” said Prof. Todd. 
“This way, please.” 

I followed the three men, but 
kept looking back over my 
shoulder. Just as I expected, the 
White Hunter was charming the 
Professor’s wife, a scene I had 
witnessed every time there was 
a giddy female in a safari. This 
time, however, he was bold to the 
point of contempt, a fact that 
was not lost on the Professor, 
who stopped at the steps of the 
traveling laboratory and looked 
after the pair. She was holding 
Lundeen’s upper arm in both her 
hands and smiling dizzily up at 
him. I saw pain cross the Profes- 
sor’s face before he turned and 
ushered us into the air-condition- 
ed laboratory, 

“Bless me!” said my husband 
in awe, while my father whistled. 
As for myself, I had seen labs of 
one sort or another, but nothing 
so marvelously compact and 
complete as this.' 

I said so, and Prof. Todd’s face 
lit up with pride. “Thank you,” 
he said. “Mr. Lundeen told me 
of your American education, 
Princess, and your work, Doctor, 
at the hospital in Mbuti, and he 
assured me that you both would 
be invaluable to our mission.” 
“We are yours to command,” 
quoted the Head Witch Doctor. 

“Good, good. Then you can 
help me organize your people in- 


to work parties, each group to 
collect whatever it’s assigned to 
— ferns, soils, barks, and so forth. 
And you. Princess, will be my 
lab assistant.” 

“And you’ll need a cleaning 
woman twice a week,” I said. 

“No, no,” said the Professor 
quickly. “Mr. Lundeen wouldn’t 
trust anyone but you to keep 
things clean and orderly. Well!” 
he exclaimed and rubbed his 
hands. “We’re practically in busi- 
ness right now!” 

“Yes,” said my husband, the 
Head Witch Doctor. “In one way 
or another, Mr. Lundeen always 
gives us the business.” 

My father had been following 
all this with great difficulty. Now 
he asked me what the arrange- 
ments were. I told him. 

“You mean that you, the Prin- 
cess, are to be a housemaid?” he 
all but roared in Pigmy. “I for- 
bid it!” 

“What seems to be the diffi- 
culty?” asked Prof. Todd, be- 
wildered. 

“He’s a stickler for protocol,” 
I answered. “We’ll straighten it 
out with Mr. Lundeen.” 

“Good, good. We don’t want 
any hurt feelings. Now, Doctor, 
I’ll need to know how many able- 
bodied people you have, so we 
can set up work parties . ” 

T ooking back over what I have 
^ written, I feel terribly unlike 


108 


GALAXY 


a professional writer. I haven’t, 
for example, told you all I knew 
about the White Hunter — that 
he came from Ohio, but wouldn’t 
wear, drive or talk anything not 
British; his owning a Land Rover 
instead of a Jeep was completely 
characteristic. You mustn’t think 
he was typical of White Hunters, 
He wasn’t typical of anything but 
a greedy, selfish, overbearing op- 
portunist, a phony who loved to 
humiliate us because we couldn’t 
hit back. And we couldn’t hit 
back because no other White 
Hunter bothered with us. They 
used to, but that was before Lun- 
deen arrived. 

I don’t know what to add 
about Prof. Todd. He was the 
average dedicated scientist who, 
for no discernible reason, hap- 
pened to be married to a vain, 
stupid woman, younger than him- 
self. 

I see that I’ve given Mrs. Todd 
only one line of dialogue, when, 
in fact, she was anything but in- 
articulate, in a nasty, bored sort 
of way — except, I soon discov- 
ered, When she was alone with an 
admirer. Or thought they were 
alone. I made a point of watching 
her and Lundeen — for my peo- 
ple’s sake, of course. I wanted 
them to be paid for their work — 
and, come to think of it, mine 
too — because so much depend- 
ed on it.. 

Which brings me to our tribal 


setup. It was commonly known 
that we Pigmies were primitive 
nomads, but I’ve never encount- 
ered anyone who knew that the 
central tribe, ours, was not. The 
satellite tribes all visited us in 
turn, for whatever meager trad- 
ing we could do, but mainly for 
treatment of their and our sick 
and aged. The White Hunter was 
essential to this because he 
brought us medicines, for which 
he extorted every last penny he 
allowed us to make from his sa- 
faris. 



<• 6 ^Things are going just beauti- 
tifully, Princess!” Prof. 
Todd said enthusiastically three 
days later. “The work parties 
would have overwhelmed me if 
not for your help with the tagging 
and classifying. I’ve never seen 
anyone pick up details as fast as 
you — unless it’s your husband!” 
A lot he knew! Between that 
fathead Lundeen and that in- 
sipid idiot Mrs. Todd, the tribe 
was on the verge of mutiny, med- 
icines or no medicines. With her 
hanging adoringly onto his arm, 
he would needle the work parties, 
in his execrable Pigmy so that 
they had either to strangle him 
or work off their anger on their 
jobs. Then, when Prof. Todd 
came up, he could only compli- 


IHE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


109 


ment Lundeen for their zeal. 
(The work parties were organiz- 
ed into squads, with each squad 
searching for a different thing, 
like soil samples, fungi, roots, 
berries and so on. And they work- 
ed in each other’s footsteps, going 
away from the compound, be- 
tween two lines of rope which 
my father and husband laid out 
differently each day.) 

After leaving the parties to the 
Head Witch Doctor and the Su- 
per Chief, the two would come to 
the lab and work me over. They 
knew none of us could complain 
to the Professor, so we were safe 
targets. Lundeen’s favorite stunt 
was to ask me to wipe things far 
over my head, which I had to 
reach by standing on a lab stool, 
and making me clean out the 
animals’ cages. Todd didn’t know 
what was going on, because the 
orders were in Pigmy. Then Mrs. 
Todd would say, “Princess, dar- 
ling, would it be too much troub- 
le to light my cigarette?” And I 
would. And she’d blow smoke in 
my face — when Todd’s back 
was turned. 

I had never felt such hatred 
before! Nor could I vent it on 
anyone or anything ; my husband 
and father had their own trou- 
bles, one treating the rebellious 
with tranquilizers and the other 
with orders to obey instructions 
and ignore the needling. 

All this was going through my 


mind when I saw Prof. Todd 
peering at me at eye-level. “I’ve 
been driving you too hard,” he 
said. “You look tired.” 

Tired? I was exhausted, work- 
ing all day and staying up all 
night to keep an eye on Lundeen 
and Mrs. Todd. And I hadn’t 
gotten anything more incrimin- 
ating on my little battery-power- 
ed tape recorder than some slurp- 
ing noises that I knew were kiss- 
es, but that wouldn’t convince 
anyone else. Neither of the pair 
was brainy enough to be so cir- 
cumspect. There had to be some 
reason for each staying in his own 
guest hut all night. I thought I 
knew what it was, so I let my 
shoulders and face slump and 
mumbled something about duty 
and honor. 

“I know how you feel; I feel 
the same way about saving lives.” 
Prof. Todd said, leading me firm- 
ly out of the laboratory. “But one 
has one’s duty to oneself too, 
you know. I want you to take the 
day off and sleep!” 

“Yes, Professor,” I said obedi- 
ently. “I could sleep for days.” 

“Then take tomorrow off as 
well,” he said, taking me to my 
hut, and he wouldn’t leave until 
I pretended to doze off. “Night- 
night, sleep tight,” he whispered, 
leaving on tippy toes. 

'T~'ake my word for it, it was al- 
most more than I could do 


no 


GALAXY 


not to fall asleep. But I had to 
stay awake! What a nice guy, I 
thought — how could he have 
stayed married to this queen, of 
the stag line? Did she, to quote 
Mad Ave, know where the body 
was buried? I didn’t know, but 
I intended to find out. 

When I was sure Prof. Todd 
was inside his lab and unlikely 
to look outside, I slipped out 
with my tape recorder and 
searched for the miscreants. As 
I suspected, they were nowhere 
in the compound. The Land Rov- 
er also was gone. 

I followed the freshest tire 
tracks out of the compound. 1 
was worried for the moment 
about being seen by the work 
parties, but the tracks led off in 
the opposite direction. 

Settling down to what was, for 
a Pigmy, and a woman at that, 
and a woman three inches shorter 
than any other adult Pigmy to 
boot, a steady lope, I kept listen- 
ing for the Land Rover and 
watching the ground for tracks 
leading off the rutted jungle 
road. Put yourself in my place, 
wouldn’t you expect them to 
di'ive miles away and get off the 
trail so they wouldn’t be sur- 
prised by a passerby? 

Au contraire, that was expect- 
ing too much of these nasty spec- 
imens, for I came upon the vehi- 
cle as I rounded a bend barely 
15 minutes from home. 


I slipped up on its blind side, 
hung my microphone on a tar- 
paulin rope and paid out wire 
as I backed off the road into the 
jungle. Screened by a bush, I 
could hear very clearly what was 
going on as I switched on the 
machine. 

“Now do you believe me, you 
mad, impetuous boy?” said Mrs. 
Todd a little breathlessly. “I told 
you I love you. How many ways 
are there of convincing you?” 
“You could tell me why you 
married him in the first place,” 
Lundeen said in a sullen voice. 

“Why, it’s obyious, sweetheart. 
Everybody expects him to win 
the Nobel Prize.” 

“So that’s why you came along 
on this expedition!” 

“Game along? I took him away 
from teaching at the University, 
bought him the best portable 
lab money could buy, financed 
the whole safari — ” 

“WHAT?” cried Lundeen. 

“You mean you didn’t know 
I’m filthy rich?” she said. “You 
loved me for myself alone?” 

I could practically hear the 
White Hunter’s excuse for a 
brain going into reverse. Knowing 
him from many safaris, I could 
tell he had been about to say 
through a stiff upper lip that he’d 
marry her in a minute if not for 
his (fictitious) wife and tots at 
home, who needed him and the 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


111 


little money he brought in from 
his safaris. 

“Of course I didn’t know,” he 
said, his voice sounding choked. 
“But what difference would it 
have made? Me a lowly — ” 
“Don’t say it!” she cried. 
“You’re a fine, handsome, intelli- 
gent man, and I can’t stand an- 
other day with that creep, even 
if he does win the Nobel Prize!” 
“Then let’s leave him here — ” 
“ — without his laboratory, so 
he can’t follow us — ” 

“ — but would you consent to 
be my — my wife?” 

“Dearest,” sh6 said, “I would. 
And you won’t have to be a 
White Hunter unless you want to 
be.” 

“Not without you,” he vowed 
piously. I believed him. He 
wouldn’t let all that money go 
unguarded. 

Well, so much for evidence. I 
had all I needed. So I stowed 
away the microphone and wire 
and headed back to the com- 
pound. They came in an hour 
later and made for Lundeen’s 
hut. I waited till they started 
packing his campaign chest, then 
went into the hut with two glass- 
es, a bottle of Scotch and a soda 
bottle on a tray. 

“Dash it all, Princess, you’re 
full of surprises!” Lundeen ex- 
claimed. “I had sort of been look- 
ing forward to our daily snit 
about bringing us drinks.” 


“One must do what one must 
do,” I said meekly. 

“I don’t leave you much choice, 
do I?” he boomed. 

“None at all.” 

“Darling, you’re so masterful,” 
Mrs. Todd was saying as I left. 

I went back to my hut and 
took out the treasure chest I kept 
under my bunk. My Barbie and 
Ken doll clothing were at the 
top. I took them out and then 
gathered all the rags I could find 
and returned to Lundeen’s hut. 
It was the sickest Night I had 
ever spent. 



T)rof. Todd looked very upset 
*• when I came into the lab the 
next morning, toting a bag and 
my tape recorder. He was wear- 
ing a surgical mask for some rea- 
son — to avoid contaminating 
the white rats he was trying to 
work on, I suppose. 

“Princess!” he cried. “My wife 
is gone!” 

“Real gone,” I said with a grin. 
“And that’s not just her opinion. 
It’s Lundeen’s, too.” 

“You think — ” he started to 
say, but couldn’t continue. 

I pushed aside the chemistry 
equipment on his table and up- 
ended my bag. Two miniature 
figures in little green smocks 
tumbled out amid the four white 
rats.

Todd stared as the figures 
jumped to their feet and, clinging 
to each other, looked wildly 
around them. 

“That’s Lundeen and my 
wife!” he gasped. “What have 
you done to them?” 

“I can’t tell you that,” I said. 
“But I want you to listen to 
something so you'll know that 
what I’ve done is justified.” And 
I played back the love scene I 
had recorded the day before. 

“So that’s why she married 
me,” he said brokenly. “I always 
wondered.” He bent down to the 
little figures. “You didn’t have 
to leave me stranded,” he cried 
out to Mrs. Todd, who clapped 
her hands over her ears. “I love 
you enough to give you a di- 
vorce.” 

Taking off his surgical mask, 
he turned to me. “You know that 
what you’ve done is impossible, 
don’t you? Nothing can shrink 
five- or six-foot people to five 
or six inches!” 

I backed away from him. “But 
that’s not what’s important!” I 
said in alarm. “Not only were 
they planning to leave you 
stranded, they were going to 
leave the tribe unpaid!” 

Todd lost his mad glare. “No 
question of it, they’re a matched 
set of stinkers,” he said. “But 
what have you done? How does it 
work? You’ve got to tell me all 
about it!” 


“I can’t. It’s so potent a taboo 
that nobody but the chiefs and 
witch doctors know about it. I 
myself learned about it only by 
accident.” 

The tiny people had been mak- 
ing shrill noises. Now Lundeen 
pushed Mrs, Todd aside and 
piped, “Todd, listen to me!” 

“What is it?” Todd asked, 
bending down to hear the 
squeaky voice. 

“The secret is in the Scotch she 
gave us yesterday. I can’t tell 
you what suffering we went 
through last night, shrinking 
down to this size. Get to that 
bottle before she does! It’s in my 
hut!” 

I was out of the lab door and 
running for Lundeen’s hut as fast 
as I could go. Halfway there, 
Todd passed me. It was the only 
time in’ my life that I ever wished 
I were not so small, for my 
strides were five to his one. And 
I cursed myself for stupidly not 
throwing the bottle into a fire. 

When he reached the hut, I 
stopped and went back to the lab. 
The tiny couple in tiny voices 
pleaded for an antidote as I 
climbed onto a stool and waited 
for Todd to come back, which he 
did a few minutes later, the bot- 
tle in his hand and a hard look 
on his face. 

Hphere was silence as he meas- 
-*• ured out the Scotch in eye-

droppers and fed different 
amounts of it to the four white 
rats. I turned away. Until last 
night, I had never seen anyone 
or anything shrink. It was a hide- 
ous thing. I had hoped never to 
see it again. 

“All right, Princess, you can 
look now,” the Professor said in 
a sick voice. 

I turned. The rats were four 
different sizes, the littlest being 
very little indeed. Prof. Todd was 
cleaning up the last evidence of 
the shrinking process, as I cleaned 
up after Lundeen and Mrs. Todd, 
in such a fright over leaving 
traces that I had overlooked the 
Scotch. 

“Is this how Pigmies get 
small?” he asked me. 

“No,” I said shakily. “We 
breed true and are immune to — 
to what I put in the bottle.” 

“Then what is it for?” 

“Babies of mixed parentage, 
Pigmy and outsider. And that is 
all I know about it!” 

“Not even the dosages?” he 
demanded. 

“Not even that,” I said. 

He filled the eyedroppers again 
and fed the mixture to the rats, 
while I looked away. When the 
feeding and shrinking had stop- 
ped, he said, “It stabilizes at one- 
tenth normal size. And you Pig- 
mies are immune to it. Which 
means — ” He stared unbeliev- 
ingly. “That’s not possible!” 


“Why not?” I said, falling back 
until he grabbed my shoulders. 
I forget which Man it was — Pe- 
king Man or Java Man or some- 
thing — ” 

“But he was only nine feet 
tall!” 

“What if he wasn’t Peking Man 
at all, but Peking Baby?” I said. 

He dropped his hands and sat 
down heavily. “Incredible,” he 
said. “Absolutely incredible.” He 
looked at me. “Princess, I’ve got 
to have a decent amount of What- 
ever it is to work on.” 

“No!” I said. “No!” 

“If you don’t get it for me,” 
he said, “I’ll invite your husband 
and father in to see what you’ve 
done to these two!” 

“Don’t — please!” I begged. 
“I’ll get you some. But you’ve 
got to help me with an alibi, so 
they don’t get suspicious.” 

“It’s a deal,” he said. 

“What about us?” shrilled 
Lundeen. “You can’t leave us 
like this!” 

Todd grinned a wicked grin. 
“Would you care to bet on that?” 
“I’ll do anything you say!” 
Mrs. Todd piped. “I’ll give you 
all my money — anything — ” 
“Don’t bother,” Todd said. “I 
intend to have incontestable 
proof of your deaths. So I get 
your money anyhow, without you 
to spoil it.” 

He put them, kicking and try- 
ing to bite, into a cage and cover- 


114

ed it. As an afterthought, he fill- 
ed the feeder of the cage with a 
slice of bread and some cold cuts 
and water. 

“Have fun, kiddies,” he said 
merrily, and we went out and he 
carefully locked the door. 

T xrhile the Professor stood 
’ ' guard, I pulled out a very 
old, very sturdy trunk from un- 
der my husband’s bunk, opened 
it and scraped off as much moss 
as I dared from the five boulders 
in it, into a test tube Prof. Todd 
had given me. I closed the trank 
and pushed it back under the 
bunk. 

“Good, good,” he said as I 
handed him the stoppered tube. 
“Now to furnish us with an alibi. 
Do you know any good places to 
lose a Land Rover?” 

“There is a dandy quicksand 
pit not far away,” I said, catch- 
ing some of his excitement. 

We got into the Land Rover, 
and I guided him to the spot. 
Pushing from the rear, we shoved 
the vehicle into the pit. When it 
vanished, we brushed away our 
footprints and went back to the 
lab. 

I told him along the way what 
little I knew of the moss — that 
it was native only to this part of 
the world, that it had been to- 
tally destroyed by our ancestors, 
except on the five stones, after 
the Pigmy elephant problem, 


that there was no antidote, and 
that not the moss but selective 
breeding accounted for the size 
I was so proud of being. 

That evening, we asked people 
if they had seen Lundeen and 
Mrs. Todd, who had never been 
this late before. As the hours 
passed, everyone got a little edgy, 
watching the gate of the com- 
pound. 

At last the Professor looked at 
his watch and said, “No sense 
staying up. They must have driv- 
en further than they realized and 
made camp.” 

So we went to bed. 

Around nopn the next day, 
Todd let himself be worked up 
over their disappearance and 
consented to lead one of their 
search parties. My husband, the 
Head Witch Doctor, and my 
father, the Super Chief, led the 
other two. Naturally, I went with 
my husband, partly because 
that’s a No. 1 wife’s place, but 
mostly because I wanted him to 
make the discovery himself — 
Which he did with only five or 
six little nudges from me. The 
drummer sent out the message 
and soon the other two parties 
joined ours. 

“A great, great pity,” said my 
father with real feeling, looking 
down sadly at the quicksand 
pit. “Now how will we get an- 
other White Hunter to bring sa- 
faris to us?” 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE

“Always the practical man,” 
my husband said admiringly. 
“Yes, this could be the end of 
tribal civilization as we know it, 
anyway.” 

Todd asked me what the un- 
seemingly grief was about, and I 
told him. Doing his best to look 
bereaved, he held up his hands 
for silence. 

“My friends — and in the short 
time I have known you, you have 
become friends in need and in 
deed — I came here in search of 
a new wonder drug and I think 
perhaps I have found it,” he said, 
with me translating as he went. 
“In return for the testimony of 
your leaders so I can inherit my 
late wife’s money, I shall finance 
the construction of a vast com- 
pound and enough huts to house 
all your tribes at one time!” 

There was a great cheer, led by 
the Head Witch Doctor and the 
Super Chief. 

“Not only that,” the Professor 
continued, “there must be room 
in the compound for one hundred 
guest huts, a tremendous meeting 
hut and a large cooking-and-eat- 
ing hut, plus classroom huts and 
an airfield. All this must be ac- 
complished within less than one 
month. Damn the expense — full 
speed ahead!” 

The crowd cheered again and 
headed homeward, talking and 
gesticulating animatedly among 
themselves. 


44Tt is very nice to become 

Aprosperous,” my father said 
in Pigmy. “But what does he 
want to spend all this money 
for?” 

“You are with him all day, 
every day,” my husband said to 
me. “It would be discourteous to 
ask outright, but has he given 
you no idea?” 

“None at all,” I confessed. 

It was true. Whatever Prof. 
Todd had dreamed up, he hadn’t 
discussed or even hinted at it till 
now, nor could I understand it 
any more than they did. I prom- 
ised to do everything possible, 
short of asking, to find out what 
he had in mind. 

Early the next morning, we 
drove to Mbuti in the mobile 
laboratory: the Professor, the 
Head Witch Doctor and the 
Super Chief in the front seat and 
me in the lab, which was kept 
locked at all times. Mrs. Todd 
and Lundeen hung onto the bars 
of their cage as the lab bounced 
and lurched in and out of the 
ruts of the jungle road. They al- 
ternately tried to bribe and 
threaten me. I looked at them 
without listening, doing my best 
to figure out what Todd meant 
to do. 

I hadn’t succeeded when we 
reached town, nor when we each 
deposed as to the fates of the un- 
lucky pair, nor when the Profes- 
sor withdrew a very large amount 


116

THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 117 


of money and gave part of it to 
my father and husband to buy 
whatever supplies were needed, 
as well as a used truck and Jeep 
that he presented to the tribe. 

While the men were shopping, 
he and I went to the cable office, 
where he sent off a number of 
telegrams to Dr. this and Prof, 
that in various countries, on both 
sides of the Iron and Bamboo 
Curtains. I had no trouble get- 
ting to see what he had composed 
as he went through a little black 
book for the addresses. He 
couldn’t have been less secretive 
about his invitation to “Spend 
Your Vacation in Glamorous, 
Unspoiled Mfouti! Live for Two 
Madcap Weeks Amid the Un- 
changing Pigmies of Still-Dark 
Africa!” And so forth. 

He smiled down at me as I 
frowned over the inscrutable tele- 
gram. 

“Puzzle you?” he asked. “It 
shouldn’t. This is why I want all 
the tribes together and the huge 
compound and huts to house 
them, because we are going to 
have company from all over the 
world. Not a great many by re- 
sort standards, but enough to 
make room for in the jungle.” 

I couldn’t ask, of course, but I 
could — and did — look wor- 
ried. 

“Are you thinking that I’ll be- 
tray your secret, Princess?” I 
nodded. “I give you my word,” 


he said, “that I shall not be the 
one to do so.” 

I brightened visibly, and when 
the other two men joined us, I 
told them about the cablegrams. 

“To study us, no doubt,” said 
the Super Chief. 

“A symposium, perhaps,” said 
the Head Witch Doctor. 

“Whatever it is,” I said, “it’ll 
be in practically the only place 
on Earth that isn’t preparing for 
war. Anyhow, we will know very 
soon. The cables gave March 
22nd as the opening date.” 

“When is that?” asked my hus- 
band. 

“I asked at the cable office. 
Three weeks from now.” 

“Then we must really hurry,” 
said my father. 

And hurry we did as each tribe 
reported in and went to work 
on its portion of the new com- 
pound and the various huts. I, 
meanwhile, assisted Todd in the 
lab, but without understanding 
what he was calling this meeting 
for. 

Could it be the strange moss? 
Then why had he carelessly em- 
ptied the test tube of it into an 
enameled tray kind of thing and 
shoved it under the lab’s night 
light and seem to have forgotten 
it? Instead, he was taking blood 
samples from many of us — and 
even with great difficulty, a tiny 
amount from Lundeen and Mrs. 
Todd. These he made plates of, 


118 


GALAXY 


and to my unskilled eyes they 
looked like any other blood speci- 
mens. Which goes to show how 
much Bio I had absorbed at Ben- 



W"ith March 22nd came bush 
’ ' planes to the landing field 
that had been completed only the 
night before. They discharged 
their passengers and took off to 
make room for more incoming 
bush planes. Prof. Todd shook 
hands with each passenger; they 
waved hello to each other and 
then were taken, along with their 
luggage, to the guest huts. Every 
hut had a sign listing the nation- 
ality of its occupants or, for the 
large ones, its function. 

Oh, I forgot to mention that 
Todd had had a generator truck 
come in and string electrical ca- 
bles to all the huts and to light 
the streets. The guests accepted 
it as normal, but our tribes were 
amazed and delighted. 

“I say, Princess,” said Lundeen 
in one of his rare polite moments, 
“the joint seems to be jumping. 
Is it because of us?” 

“Not at all,” I gloated. “The 
Professor gave me his word that 
he wouldn’t betray my awful re- 
venge.” 

“Awful is the word,” said Mrs. 
Todd. “How could you do such 
a thing?” 


“I didn’t know,” I said guiltily. 
“I knew it would dirink you 
somewhat, but I never sus- 
pected — ” 

“Never mind what you never 
suspected,” said Lundeen, rat- 
tling the door of their cage. “Get 
us out of here. It’s not decent to 
lock up two human beings like a 
couple of canaries!” 

“It’s better than you deserve!” 
I snapped back, pulling the cover 
down over the cage to shut out 
their accusing voices. 

Prof. Todd unlocked the door 
and came into the lab, locking 
the door again before sitting on 
a stool in the flow of the air 
conditioner. “This is the only tol- 
erable place in the compound,” 
he said, fanning himself. “Wish 
I’d had time to air-condition the 
huts.” 

“Please, Professor!” said Lun- 
deen’s muffled voice. “Take the 
cover off. We’ll behave.” 

Todd ignored him, saying, 
“Every last person I sent a cable- 
gram to is here! Not a single ab- 
sentee!” 

“That’s wonderful,” I said. 
“And you all seem to know one 
another.” 

He gave me a wicked grin. 
“You’d love to know what’s going 
on, wouldn’t you? But you can’t 
ask because that would be rude. 
Right? 

I admitted it. 

“Well,” he said, “you and the 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 119 


other leaders of your tribes are 
invited to the meeting hut to- 
night, and you’ll learn about what 
you and I have been doing for 
the past few weeks.” 

“But what about us?” shrilled 
Mrs. Todd under the cover. 

“What about you?” mocked 
Prof. Todd. “Seems to me that 
your bodies just about fit your 
souls!” 

TYowever, it was an indication 
of his own great soul that 
he uncovered their cage and left 
the light on before locking the 
laboratory. Can you imagine 
what those two would have done 
if the situation were reversed? 
So could I. I said so. 

“Princess,” he said thoughtful- 
ly, “if a person, a family, a tribe 
or a nation imitates an enemy’s 
cruelty or oppression, there 
would be nothing to distinguish 
one from the other. The more 
morality you give up, the more 
animal you become, the less you 
deserve to win an argument or 
a war.” 

“Even temporarily?” I asked. 
“Just long enough to win?” 

“No! Before, during and after 
the duration — however long it 
takes — however necessary it 
seems!” He unclenched his fists 
and smiled crookedly. “Sorry. 
It’s the one subject I get violent 
on. See you in the meeting hut.” 
Shaken by his vehemence, I 


watched him stride off to his own 
hut, a young man aged before his 
time by clinging to ideals all but 
gone in a world heading for a 
final smashup. 

I found my husband and the 
Super Chief in our hut, listening 
to the news on my portable radio 
while waiting supper for me. I sat 
down, and the No. 2 and No. 3 
Wives served us a really good 
warthog stew. I complimented 
them, and they giggled a thank 
you. To me, then, it was just an 
average cozy family scene, with 
no hint of the incredible turmoil 
so short a time away. I hope they 
all know how much I miss them, 
wherever they are. 

Depressed as we always were 
by the world’s headlong rush to- 
ward destruction, the Head Witch 
Doctor turned off the radio and 
asked whether I knew anything 
more than I had the day before. 

“Afraid not,” I said. “But the 
Professor assured me we would 
learn all about it tonight.” 

“Just more blood samples?” he 
said. I nodded. “I asked the 
Chest and Belly Witch Doctors 
what it could mean. They told me 
they didn’t know, but judging 
from the attendance here, with 
scientists from everywhere on 
Earth, it must be as important a 
discovery as antibiotics.” 

“I hope you can translate it 
into Pigmy that I can under- 
stand,” said the Super Chief. 


120 


GALAXY 


“I’ll do my best,” I promised, 
“but science was never my best 
subject.” 

“I just hope I can stay awake,” 
said the Head Witch Doctor 
wearily. “I’ve got a six-month 
backlog of mental cases since the 
other tribes came.” 

“If I can help with the laying 
on of hands, call on me,” offered 
the Super Chief. 

“Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind. 
Wait! There’s a young girl who.” 

I left them talking shop and 
wandered around the com- 
pound just as the lights came on. 
Huge as it was, it seemed more 
crowded even than New York or 
Boston, each hut spilling adults 
and children of all ages into the 
street, and everywhere under foot 
ran the multitudes of dogs that 
had come along as part of each 
family. Naturally, I had to say 
hello every step of the way, so I 
was glad to join the crowd en- 
tering the meeting hut. 

By Pigmy standards, the hut 
was as enormous as Yankee Sta- 
dium. There were wooden bench- 
es that the Professor had ordered 
built spaced evenly from the en- 
trance to the movie screen at the 
extreme end, leaving only enough 
room for the aisles, which right 
now were jammed with men and 
women from all over, clustered 
in loud, gesticulating groups. 
They mostly spoke English, 


though I did hear some French 
and Russian. 

“Order, please! Order!” said 
the voice of Prof. Todd over the 
loudspeakers mounted on the 
poles holding up the roof. 
“Everyone please be seated!” 

The hubbub died as the peo- 
ple took their seats, including us 
Pigmies, and I saw Todd in the 
center aisle with a movie pro- 
jector. 

“This had better be good!” 
someone said very loudly. 

“That,” Todd said into his mi- 
crophone, “is for posterity to 
judge. But I think my using the 
secret assembly call will be jus- 
tified.” 

He dimmed the house lights 
and turned on the projector. The 
screen lit up with vividly colored 
swimming shapes that I recog- 
nized as bacteria and blood cells. 
This, of course, was what the 
Professor and I had been film- 
ing with microscope and movie 
camera. Into this swarming col- 
ony came a giant blunt object — 
a pipette — and suddenly the 
bacteria began shrinking. The 
crowd murmured excitedly. 

“That’s our secret ingredient!” 
the Head Witch Doctor said to 
me through his teeth. “How did 
he get hold of it?” 

“The work parties?” I suggest- 
ed, innocently. 

He nodded and subsided as the 
Professor explained that this sub- 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


121 


stance, unknown anywhere else 
in the world, was shrinking one 
deadly bacillus after another 
right before their eyes. 

“Why doesn’t it shrink the 
blood cells?” someone called out. 

“That,” Prof. Todd evaded, 
“needs more study. After all, I 
have been here only a few weeks.” 

“What about viruses?” some- 
body else inquired. 

He was intimating that they 
too were undoubtedly shrunken, 
but that his equipment had nec- 
essarily been limited in portabili- 
ty, While I, translating all this to 
the Super Chief with one part of 
my mind, was using the other 
part to figure out. another ques- 
tion: why hadn’t the blood cells 
also contracted? 

The answer came to me so sud- 
denly that I almost jumped up 
and blurted it out : the blood was 
from us Pigmies and Lundeen 
and Mrs. Todd only! Which led 
to still another question : how 
would he keep the audience from 
testing it on their own blood? I 
didn’t know, but my respect for 
him had grown even greater; I 
was sure he had it all worked out 
in his mind. 

IT Then the film ended, the 
’ ' scientists sat stunned. One 
man finally stood up and said, 
“If ever I have seen a discovery 
worthy of the Nobel Prize, this 
is it!” 


Everybody applauded. Prof. 
Todd looked as if he wished he 
had a pebble to kick, so he could 
say, “Aw, shucks, fellas — ” They 
crowded around him, noiser than 
before the show, while my people 
left the meeting hut in cold si- 
lence. 

I pretended to have some rea- 
son for going to the laboratory, 
but my husband took my wrist 
in his hand and led me politely 
but firmly to our hut. “We have 
some matters that need to be 
taken care of,” he said, and the 
chiefs and witch doctors of the 
tribes nodded grimly. 

He pulled the old trunk from 
beneath his bunk and opened it. 
The five rocks looked exactly as 
they always had. And why not? 
I had exposed the moss to light 
until the little scratches I had 
made grew back again. But I 
needn’t have bothered, I discov- 
ered, for he dragged it into the 
street, filled it with firewood — 
and threw a blazing torch into it. 

“There,” he said. “Wherever 
the Professor got his sample no 
longer matters. It is a sheer mir- 
acle that it hadn’t been discover- 
ed long ago.” He turned toward 
me. “Princess,” he said, “you 
must find and destroy his speci- 
men!” 

“Right!” a chief said. “If it is 
used by everyone, being a Pigmy 
won’t be the great honor it is 
today!” 


122 


GALAXY 


“Maybe they won’t want the 
honor,” I said diplomatically. 

“Not want it?” the Super Chief 
repeated in outraged amazement. 
“Have you ever heard such non- 
sense?” 

“Never!” said the Head Witch 
Doctor, and even I had to join 
the nodding; I hadn’t believed 
my suggestion for an instant. He 
pointed in the general direction 
of the lab and said, “Go! Do 
your duty!” 

I left quickly, as a good little 
Pigmy wife should, and a few 
minutes later was at the lab, ring- 
ing the doorbell. The Professor 
peeked at me through the peep- 
hole and let me in, pointing to 
the other stool. I climbed up it 
as he raised the volume of his 
radio-looking thing, which he had 
been listening to. 

“This will give you a kick, 
Princess!” he said with that typi- 
cal crooked grin. “Recognize 
anybody’s voice?” 

I had been looking intently at 
the enameled tray he had dump- 
ed the test tube into and put up 
near the night light and wonder- 
ing how I could get up there 
without his noticing. It was im- 
possible with him present. I 
would have to find an excuse for 
staying after he left and hope 
he would believe it. 

I unfrowned and cocked my 
head toward the radio, pretend- 
ing to listen — and almost fell off 


the stool, for, hearing the squeaky 
little voices of Lundeen and Mrs. 
Todd, I glanced up and saw their 
cage with its door open and them 
gone! 

“How — how — ” I stammer- 
ed. 

“By tying tag strings together 
and getting through the air-con- 
ditioning duct,” he said happily. 

“You don’t look as if you 
cared,” I said. 

“Oh, but I do!” he exclaimed. 
“Listen! They’re at the English 
hut.” 

“Naturally,” I said. “Where 
else would that silly Anglophile 
go?” 

A genuine British voice could 
now be heard saying, “It isn’t 
as if we doubted your word, old 
boy, but how do we know you 
weren’t always this size arid that 
this perfectly ordinary-looking 
moss you’ve brought us isn’t per- 
fectly ordinary?” 

Lundeen’s very high, very ex- 
cited and very fake British voice 
said, “Dash it all, try it on your- 
selves!” 

“On ourselves?” echoed an- 
other speaker. “What if it’s poi- 
sonous or something?” 

“Absolutely,” the first man 
agreed. There was silence, broken 
by. the barking of the ubiquitous 
dogs outside. “I’ve got it!” he 
said. “Why not try it on one of 
these cursed mongrels?” 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE

“Capital idea!” “Excellent sug- 
gestion!” and other compliments 
led to someone going out into the 
street and returning shortly with 
a yapping mutt. 

“How do we feed it to him?” 
someone asked. “In Scotch, like 
you?” 

“I don’t think dogs drink 
Scotch,” Lundeen said. “Why not 
water?” 

“Why not indeed?” said the 
first man. There was a splashing 
sound followed by a mixing 
sound, and he said, “Here you 
are, Bowser! Drink it down like a 
good fellow,” which was succeed- 
ed by a lapping sound, then si- 
lence. 

“Great Scott!” one of the men 
cried in horror, and the rest made 
a sort of suppressed retching 
sound. 

“You see? You see?” Lundeen 
and Mrs. Todd kept shrilling. 

When it was all over, the first 
man asked, “Did anyone think 
of measuring the poor beast be- 
fore and after?” 

“No, but I’d say he’s no more 
than one-tenth his original size,” 
a man answered. 

The others agreed. 

“Well,” the first one said brisk- 
ly, “let’s get down to cold facts, 
shall we? The stuff works; I 
think we’re all convinced of that. 
That being so, the next question 
is: have you brought us enough 
to serve as a starter set?” 


“Plenty!” shrilled Lundeen. 
“Todd dumped the same amount 
into a tray and kept it under a 
light and now the tray is almost 
overflowing!” 

I looked up at the tray and 
down at Prof. Todd, who was lis- 
tening with a great beatific smile 
on his face. So that was why he 
had emptied the test tube with 
such seeming indifference! 

With equal seeming indiffer- 
ence, I moved my stool under 
the light. He didn’t notice. I took 
a beaker of some acid and wari- 
ly stood on the stool. His back 
was to me when I poured the acid 
into the tray. I climbed down 
and put the beaker back just as 
he turned off the radio and swung 
around to face me. 

“Let’s get out of here, Prin- 
cess,” he said, grinning. “Those 
two have to get back in again 
without suspecting we know what 
they’ve done.” 

Of course, I assented readily. 
Half of my job was done. The 
only problem remaining was: 
how could I get rid of the last of 
the moss in the British guest hut? 

Hpodd and I said good night, 
and he made for his hut while 
I went toward the British one. 
Crouching in its shadow, I waited 
until after the light was doused. 
When I was sure they were all 
asleep, I began edging to the 
door. I heard a faint noise and 


124 


GALAXY 


stopped dead. A man in pajamas 
came stealing out. He darted 
from hut to hut, pausing at each 
one to look about before going 
on to the next. He slipped into 
the seventh hut, an din a moment 
the light went on. 

I sneaked up to the hut and 
listened — in its shadow, natu- 
rally. 

“ — mean by waking us up?” 
a heavy Slavic voice was de- 
manding. 

“I had to,” a British voice said 
urgently. “It’s of the utmost im- 
portance. Now please listen at- 
tentively. I may not have time to 
repeat.” And he told them all 
about Lundeen, Mrs. Todd, the 
moss and the dog. 

When he finished, someone 
laughed. As if at a signal, the 
others began laughing, too. 

“Please! Please!” the British 
voice said. “If you don’t believe 
me, try it on a dog. But do it 
quickly, before I’m missed!” 

“It is your story,” another 
Slavic voice said. “You get the 
dog.” 

I retreated behind the hut as 
the man in pajamas came out 
and looked up and down the 
street. “Just my luck,” he mut- 
tered bitterly, “they’re all asleep. 
Here, Spot! Here, Prince, Fido, 
Rags!” And he snapped his fin- 
gers until a dog a few huts away 
came ambling up with its tail 
wagging drowsily. 


He took it inside. For the next 
space of time I was glad again 
that I only had to hear the pro- 
cess instead of seeing it. 

“So,” the first Slavic voice said 
stolidly. “It is like you say. The 
dog is maybe a tenth of its former 
size. So?” 

“What good is that?” another 
said. “Who would want such little 
dogs?” 

“For this you expect to get 
paid?” the leader asked. 

“Damn, damn and double 
damn!” the Englishman exploded 
in a furious whisper. “Do you 
think I’m a traitor? I brought 
you some of this stuff because it 
might have military importance. 
Don’t ask me how — I’m only 
a scientist. But if it does, I don’t 
want one half of the world using 
it on the other half — and that 
means your half as well as mine!” 

“Da, we have such soft-headed 
people among us, too,” said the 
leader. “But it could be. It could 
be .... ” 

“Well, you work it out your- 
selves,” the Englishman said. “I 
must get back now.” 

“Wait!” said the leader. “What 
should we do with the little dog?” 

“That’s your problem,” said 
the Englishman, sprinting out the 
door. 

So I set the hut afire, then went 
down to the British hut and did 
the same there. They were lovely 
fires. I stood admiring them while 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


125 


the men of both huts came rush- 
ing out. 

“Did you save anything?” one 
of the Englishmen asked another. 

“Just the moss and my tennis 
racquet,” the second replied. 

My heart fell. But it lifted as 
I followed the Englishman with 
the peculiar morality to the Rus- 
sian hut. 

“Did you save the moss?” he 
asked anxiously. 

“Just that and my balalaika,” 
the leader said. 

I trudged worriedly home to 
bed. My husband, the Head 
Witch Doctor, opened his eyes 
and asked, “Have you destroyed 
the moss?” 

“Half of it,” I said with ellipti- 
cal truth. I didn’t dare tell him 
now I had two more halves to 
destroy. — 



TTThen he was gone the next 
’ ’ morning, I took the revolv- 
er from his footlocker and put it 
in my pocket, then went asking 
for the English and Russian 
scientists. I was told that Dr. 
Perry and Prof. Kropotkin were 
with Todd, whom they had asked 
to radio for a bush plane. I ran 
to the lab. Todd and the two 
men were in the Jeep, about to 
leave. 

“Stop!” I yelled. “I have to 
come along!” 


They waited for me. When I 
was aboard, Todd stepped on the 
gas. I looked at their luggage. 
Each had an overnight bag, do- 
nated, no doubt, by luckier fel- 
low countrymen. And each over- 
night bag carried the moss, I was 
sure. 

“Terribly sorry about the fire,” 
said Todd. “Lost everything, eh?” 

“Down to the last button,” Dr. 
Perry said. 

“Me, too,” said Prof. Kropot- 
kin. “But why only our two 
huts?” 

“I can’t possibly imagine,” said 
Todd jauntingly. 

I sat back, trying to work out 
my strategy. I could shoot Todd 
and perhaps one of the others, 
not both, before being overpow- 
ered. The Jeep would smash into 
something — and spill the moss 
all over the place. No good. I had 
to get aboard the bush plane 
somehow and wait for my chance. 

The plane was waiting on the 
airfield when we got there. Pull- 
ing up alongside it, Prof Todd 
shook hands with both men, put 
his hand in a pocket, brought it 
out and shook my hand. When 
he let go, I felt something wadded 
up in my palm. I didn’t have time 
to look as he all but pushed us 
into the plane. 

“Have a good trip!” he sang 
out. “As for you, Princess Wam- 
ba, come back when you’re 
ready!” 


126 


GALAXY 



The pilot closed the door and 
came through for the fares. I 
opened my hand and found in it 
a 'ball of green papers. When I 
smoothed them out, the pilot 
goggled and said. “Golly, Prin- 
cess, I can’t change that!” 

Prof. Todd had slipped me four 
$1,000 bills! 

I smiled nervously and prom- 
ised to have one changed when 
we landed, so I could pay him. 
He said, “Never mind. Royalty 
rides free on my plane!” 

“Thank you,” I said regally. 

He disappeared up front, clos- 
ing the door behind him. I sat 
in back of the two men until we 
took off and leveled out. Then 
I got up and menaced them with 
the revolver. 

“All right,” I said, “hand over 
the moss — and no funny busi- 
ness — or you get plugged!” 

D r. Perry studied me and the 
gun. “What bad movie is 
that from?” 

“C’mon, c’mon!” I ground out. 
“The moss — hand it over!” 

“You really seem determined,” 
Perry said thoughtfully. “But 
Why both of us? Do you know 
something I don’t know?” 

“Yes! Somebody in your party 
is a traitor — gave some of the 
moss to the Russians. Now let’s 
have it — or else!” 

He turned to Prof. Kropotkin. 
“Is that true?” 


“Of course,” Kropotkin said 
with a smile. “I trust you do not 
expect me to reveal his name.” 
“Not at all, not at all,” Dr. 
Perry said hastily. “No more than 
we would turn over our list to 
you.” 

I was getting exasperated with 
this dialogue, which shut out me 
and my revolver. I waved it and 
threatened to shoot if they didn’t 
come across. 

Dr. Perry stood up and moved 
toward me. “My dear girl, this 
is preposterous. Now if you’ll just 
give me the gun, we’ll all forget 
the whole unpleasant incident.” 
“No, you don’t!” I cried, pan- 
icking. I ran to the door of the 
cockpit, grasped it and pulled. 
“It’s locked!” 

“Did you think you were the 
only person who ever tried this?” 
Perry asked soothingly. “Now do 
be reasonable . ” 

I shut my eyes and squeezed 
the trigger with both hands. 
Nothing happened! 

He took the revolver away 
quite easily, saying, “Every gun 
I’ve ever been personally associ- 
ated with had a safety latdh, you 
know. Sort of evens things up 
with idiots who didn’t know it 
was loaded, wouldn’t you say?” 

I sat down with my face in my 
hands. “Now I’ll never be able 
to go home again! They would 
abandon me in the jungle!” 

“In this day and age? Never!” 


128 


GALAXY 


Prof. Kropotkin said, putting an 
arm around my shoulder and 
holding me comfortingly against 
his chest. 

“No, really they would,” Perry 
told him. “I read it somewhere. 
Well, there’s only one thing to do. 
I’ll take her back to London with 

„ - ff 

me. 

“And what is wrong with me 
taking her to Moscow?” Kropot- 
kin demanded. 

“I don’t want to go with either 
of you,” I sobbed. “Won’t you 
please give me the moss so I can 
destroy it and go home?” 

“Dreadfully sorry, Your High- 
ness,” said Perry. 

“Not a chance,” said Kropot- 
kin. “I would like to destroy his 
moss and he would like to de- 
stroy mine. But we are rational 
human beings, with no love for 
violence. So come with me!” 

“No, me!” cried Perry. 

I looked at them through a 
blur of tears. “Then I guess I’ll 
go with you, Dr. Perry. At least I 
know the language. I’ll come to 
Moscow, Prof. Kropotkin, after 
I finally destroy Dr. Perry’s spec- 
imen.” 

“Fine!” exclaimed Kropotkin. 
“I promise you full-scale red-car- 
pet welcome — from primitive 
Africa to People’s Democracy!” 

“That will be nothing compar- 
ed with our reception!” said Per- 
ry. “You won’t regret your de- 
cision, Princess!” 


W e were all quite friendly by 
the time we reached 
Mlarki, the nearest jet airfield. I 
didn’t really know what to ex- 
pect, but it certainly wasn’t sup- 
ersonic military airplanes wait- 
ing for us, one from England and 
the other from Russia. There was 
time only for a last friendly wave 
before Dr. Perry and I were hus- 
tled into our plane and Prof. 
Kropotkin into his. 

As soon as we were airborne, 
Dr. Perry opened his overnight 
bag, and I was amazed to see 
Lundeen, Mrs. Todd and the tiny 
dog climb out. 

“About time!” shrilled Lun- 
deen. 

“I look simply dreadful!” Mrs. 
Todd complained. “Couldn’t you 
have brought my cosmetics 
along?” 

“Plenty where we’re going,” 
Perry said. “And now, if you’ll 
excuse me, I must catch up on 
my beauty rest.” 

He dozed right off. The tiny 
people and the dog all began 
barking at me, so I closed my 
eyes and ears and went to sleep. 

It was just lunchtime when we 
landed in England. Dr. Perry 
put them into the overnight bag 
and closed it on Lundeen’s yap- 
ping about carrying it carefully, 
and we disembarked — into a 
screaming, jostling mob, all push- 
ing papers and pens at me for my 
autograph. 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE

“What is this all about?” I 
shouted at Perry. 

“We wirelessed ahead,” he 
shouted back. “Look at the head- 
lines.” 

I did. The newspapers I was 
being asked to autograph read: 

U. K. HAILS ARRIVAL 
OF PRINCESS WAMBA 

So I signed everything happily, 
enjoying every minute of it. 
When I looked up for Dr. Perry, 
I saw him surrounded by a fly- 
ing wedge of soldiers. 

“Where are you going?” I 
shrieked in alarm. 

“To be debriefed,” he yelled. 
“I’ll ring you up when you’re 
settled in.” 

And he was led away just as 
a Rolls-Royce came onto the 
field, and I was ushered inside 
and we drove off. Two men sat 
in the front seat, looking very 
formidable, and I jumped when 
a voice next to me said, “Allow 
me to introduce myself, Your 
Highness. I am Lord Fairfax.” 

“That’s nice,” I said, trying to 
see where Dr. Perry was being 
taken, but he disappeared from 
view. I turned around to Lord 
Fairfax and, “Why are he and I 
being separated?” 

“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said 
Lord Fairfax. 

“Then suppose we go back and 
pick him up and — ” 


“Oh, that would 'be militarily 
impossible!” 

“What about my staying at his 
house?” I said nastily. 

“Against protocol,” he stated. 
“I’m sure Dr. Perry is a perfectly 
splendid host. But he is, after gll, 
a commoner.” 

“Well, where am I staying?” 

“Why, with me, to be sure. At 
my town house. I shall do every- 
thing possible to make your stay 
as pleasant as possible.” He 
frowned. “That makes two ‘possi- 
bles’ in one sentence, doesn’t it? 
Dreadfully sorry. Is there any- 
thing in particular you would like 
for luncheon?” 

“Yes,” I said. “Aardvark 
steak.” 

“I shall comb all London for 
one,” he promised. 

“And then,” I said, “I want to 
go straight to Dr. Perry’s house. 
Commoner or no commoner.” 

“Yes, Your Highness,” Lord 
Fairfax said, retreating to his 
corner of the seat. 



U nless you’ve been given the 
royal treatment, you can’t 
imagine how busy it keeps you. 
I met Lord Fairfax’s wife and 
servants, dozens of them, was as- 
signed the East Wing of the 
manor, then lunohed — on aard-

— and world-famous designers 
took my measurements for the 
most astonishing wardrobe, which 
I was most grateful for when it 
was delivered; London is awfully 
chilly that time of year, and I 
had only the clothes I wore when 
leaving home. 

Then, when I was presentable, 
there were dinners, high teas, 
elevenses, a ball in my honor — 
and I was presented to King 
Charles and the entire court, 
which I had to be prepared for 
days in advance. His Majesty 
was most gracious and, as we 
used to say at Bennington, I got 
a real charge out of the whole 
royal business. Oh, and the ballet, 
the opera, the theater — I fell 
into bed every night, so exhaust- 
ed but overstimulated that I said, 
“Who?” When Dr. Perry phoned, 
weeks later. 

“Africa,” he said. “Mlarki to 
London.” 

“Oh, the man with the moss!” I 
exclaimed. 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about,” he said guardedly. “I 
called to invite you to dinner.” 

I checked my date book. “I’m 
over my head with appointments 

— three magazine covers to pose 
for, two interviews, a profile, ses- 
sions with, the person who’s writ- 
ing my autobiography — 

“Yes, yes,” he said. “You’re the 
hit of the season; can’t open any- 
thing in print without seeing your 


face or by-line. Now when can 
we have dinner together?” 

“Would some time next month 
do?” 

“That depends on when you 
want to light a little bonfire,” he 
said. 

“Oh.” I said. “That’s different. 
I’ll cancel everything. Just tell 
me the time and place.” 

“My home. Tomorrow night. 
Alone.” 

He gave me the address and 
hung up. Next night, Lord Hali- 
fax’s chauffeur handed me out of 
the silver Rolls-Royce right on 
the dot. I told him to wait; I 
didn’t expect a long visit, just 
dinner and burning the moss and 
home by ten. Dr. Perry himself 
opened the door, so promptly 
that I thought he’d been waiting 
for my ring. He sort of reded 
back as I entered. 

“Princess!” he cried. “I’d never 
have known you! You’re daz- 
zling!” 

He stroked my sable coat a 
moment, before hanging it up. 
Then he led me to his little bar, 
and we had a little drinkie and 
then to dinner, which he told me 
he had cooked himself — and 
which he served himself. 

“Are your chef and butler off 
for the evening?” I asked. 

“Chef and butler?” He laughed 
himself red in the face. “I don’t 
even have a wife or mistress!” he 
said, coughing. 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


131 


I shuddered inwardly as I re- 
membered my insistence on stay- 
ing at his house. Imagine all these 
weeks without servants — and a 
bachelor’s flat at that! But I kept 
up my end of the conversation, 
which was mostly about my ad- 
ventures in London, until I could 
decently mention the moss. 

He finished his wine, a very or- 
dinary vin ordinaire, and took me 
to his little laboratory at the rear 
of the house. “There!” he said, 
picking up a little chafing dish 
kind of thing and handing it to 
me. “It is yours to do with as you 
wish!” 

“It seems like such a little bit 
of moss,” I said. 

“I give you my word that it’s 
exactly the same amount we start- 
ed with.” 

I laughed with girlish glee as I 
set fire to it. “Well, that’s 
that,” I said. “Now how about 
Prof. Kropotkin’s moss?” 

“Everything is arranged,” he 
said. “There will be a Soviet 
plane to take you to Moscow at 
noon tomorrow. Kropotkin will be 
among the delegation to meet 
you.” 

“It’s so terribly sudden,” I said. 
“I have to call off so many ap- 
pointments. How can I do it with 
so little notice?” 

“You’ll find a way,” he told 
me. “You do want to see your 
husband and father, don’t you?” 


And so I spent a sleepless night 
writing excuses and a hurried 
morning phoning those I couldn’t 
write to. Then I thanked the 
Fairfaxes, gave each servant a 
handsome gratuity, and was at 
the airport with 15 minutes to 
spare, complete with the fantastic 
wardrobe I had accumulated in 
London with my personal ap- 
pearances and endorsements. 

I slept aboard the plane and 
nodded through the reception at 
Moscow, until Prof. Kropotkin 
came into view among the high 
dignitaries. I shook his hand and 
asked when I could destroy the 
moss. 

“First you must give us equal 
time with England,” he said jov- 
ially. 

So I lived in the Kremlin, re- 
viewed the military might, walk- 
ing, riding or being dragged 
through Red Square — from 
Lenin’s tomb, of course — in- 
spected factories, appeared at 
ballet, theater, opera, on TV and 
in the newspapers and maga- 
zines. I made a great hit when I 
said, “If I weren’t a princess, 
there is nothing I would rather 
be than a commoner in London 
or Moscow.” 

For the sake of brevity, let me 
state simply that between those 
two great capitals, I was worn 
skinny before they let me visit 
Kropotkin for dinner and moss- 
burning. Then I flew back to 


132 


GALAXY 


Mlarki and home. At last! But 
would my husband, the Head 
Witch Doctor, and my father, the 
Supbr Chief, welcome me as glad- 
ly as had Moscow and London? 

“You’ve burned it all?” my 
husband asked. 

“Every bit Kropotkin and Per- 
ry had,” I told them. 

They both put their arms 
around me. As I dabbed at my 
eyes, I saw Prof. Todd grinning 
crookedly down at me. We shook 
hands enthusiastically and he 
said, “My lab’s gone to pot since 
you left. Want to come back?” 

I nodded, too overcome by 
emotion to speak. 

And that, I innocently thought, 
was that. 

But Todd and my two men 
toured the whole gigantic com- 
pound with me in the tribal Jeep, 
where I was shown everybody 
talking back to phonographs that 
were talking to them in English 
and other languages, and then to 
the airfield, where they showed 
me Pigmies learning to fly planes. 

“What on Earth is going on?” 
I asked blankly. 

“We Pigmies are about to take 
our rightful places,” the Super 
Chief said — in perfectly good 
English! When I commented on 
that, he said, “You can’t beat the 
phonograph to teach foreign lan- 
guages.” 

“All of us?” I said. 

“Every man, woman and 


child,” the Head Witch Doctor 
replied. “We are going to bring 
peace to the world.” 

“When?” I asked. “How?” 
“You’ll know when before any- 
body else.” said Prof. Todd. “The 
how will be explained in an arti- 
cle I’m writing for the British 
medical magazine Lancet .” 

And that was all I could get 
out of them, I doubted if my hus- 
band and father knew how it all 
would come about, for I plagued 
them with questions. But why 
would I know before anybody 



S ome months later, when I wa$ 
reluctantly tuning in my radio, 
which had been bristling with 
every nation threatening its 
neighbors, I heard only silence. 
Puzzled, I changed the batteries, 
then turned the dials slowly. 
Nothing! From nearby Mlarki 
to the farthest Greenland — not 
a sound, not a voice! 

When I told this to my hus- 
band, he suggested telling Prof. 
Todd. I did, panting from run- 
ning to his hut. 

“You see?” he said trium- 
phantly. “I said you would be the 
first to know. Now we must as- 
semble all the tribes and put 
Plan C into effect!” 

“What were Plan A and Plan 
B?” I asked in bewilderment. 


THE TRANSMOGRIFICATION OF WAMBA'S REVENGE 


133 


“Dr. Perry and Prof. Kropot- 
kin,” he explained on the run. 

‘‘What about them?” I yelled, 
but he was out of earshot. 

He had been heading for the 
meeting hut. I followed him. By 
the time I reached it, sirens were 
blaring all over the compound. 
Everybody came from every- 
where and raced to the meeting 
hut. 

Inside, Prof. Todd was stand- 
ing at a lectern at the front of the 
huge auditorium, waiting for all 
of us to take our seats. His grin 
was more crooked than I had 
ever seen it. The Super Chief and 
the Head Witch Doctor were 
seated behind him, facing the 
audience. He beckoned to me to 
sit with them. As I obeyed, the 
bustle ceased. Every eye was on 
him. 

“Brothers and sisters, nieces 
and nephews,” he said, “The day 
has come! We have labored long 
and hard for this moment. Every 
one of you, including the chil- 
dren, knows English, and most of 
you know another language be- 
sides, as well as the history, cus- 
toms and economics of the coun- 
try you have been assigned to. 
We must move swiftly to bring 
order out of the chaos the world 
is in. Can we do it?” 

“Yes!” the crowd roared. 

“Good, good,” he said. “Now 
let’s line up according to conti- 
nent.” 


“What about us?” I asked my 
husband. 

“We’re the Supreme Arbiters,” 
he said. “Didn’t the Professor tell 
you how we’ve been organizing 
ourselves?” 

“Not a word,” I answered. 
“We’ve been busy experimenting 
on all kinds of vegetation.” 

“With what results?” 

“None,” I said. “Not a thing.” 
“That’s wonderful!” cried my 
father. “Absolutely wonderful!” 
“What’s wonderful?” I asked 
in complete confusion. “Why 
won’t anyone tell me what this 
is all about?” 

Prof. Todd had turned toward 
us, listening and grinning. “Please 
join me in leading the parade to 
the airfield,” he said, “and I’ll ex- 
plain on the way.” 

We fell into step with him. 
Suddenly I remembered running 
after him, when my stride was 
five to his one. Now — I compar- 
ed him with my two men and 
realized what I had not noticed, 
the change had been so gradual. 
Prof. Todd was mere inches taller 
than them, instead of almost two 
feet, and our strides were just 
about equal!” 

6i'\7"ou guessed it, Princess,” 
* he said cheerfully. “Every 
living thing on Earth — except 
vegetation — is on its way toward 
becoming a tenth of its former 
size!”

“The moss?” I asked. He nod- 
ded. “But I destroyed it all!” 
“Token amounts,” he said. 
“Just enough to keep you from 
unwittingly spoiling Plan C.” 
“You haven’t explained Plan 
A and Plan B,” I said, angry at 
being made a mere puppet. 

“Dr. Perry and Prof. Kropotkin 
did what I wanted them to do,” 
he said. “They turned over the 
moss and the tiny people and 
dogs to their military, who im- 
mediately saw its strategic value. 
Their nations grew the moss as 
fast as it would grow — which is 
phenomenally when exposed to 
light hydroponic tanks — and 
shared it with their allies. When 
they had enough of it they spir- 
ited it into the streams, rivers, 
lakes and reservoirs of their en- 
emies. There isn’t one single piece 
of land, from all the continents 
to the tiniest island, that isn’t 
clogged with it.” 

“But how did they do it?” I 
asked. 

“Tourists,” he said. 

“And what is Plan C?” 

“To take over the world.” He 
laughed teasingly. “But first, 
let’s get your people distributed.” 
There were many bush planes 
on the airfield, which were loaded 
according to ultimate destination, 
and flown to Mlarki by Pigmy 
pilots, where supersonic jets 
stood waiting, also manned by 
Pigmies. Each jet had its destina- 


tions clearly marked and filled 
up with people Who knew exactly 
where they were going, and why, 
and what they were to do there. 

Except me. 

I found my hand being shaken 
while my husband and father 
took turns hugging me and saying 
good-by. “Wait!” I wailed. “I 
don’t know what’s expected of 
me! And when will I see my two 
men again?” 

“The Pigmies assigned to each 
nation are responsible to you, 
the Head Witch Doctor and the 
Super Chief,” said Todd, finally 
letting go of my hand. “You’ll see 
them both two weeks a year, on 
your vacations.” 

“With pay!” added my father. 

“And what will you do?” I 
asked Prof. Todd. 

“Go back to the specimens we 
gathered, an experiment rudely 
interrupted,” he said. “But I’ll 
need a lab scaled down to the size 
I’ll soon be.” 

“Don’t grieve,” my husband 
said comfortingly. “It’s the no- 
blest job a people can have, 
bringing peace and justice to the 
world. Anyhow, we’ll be talking 
by telephone as often as the bud- 
get will allow.” 

“And will I always be your 
Number One Wife?” I asked fear- 
fully. 

“Always,” he said. 

“Promise?” 

“Promise.”

To put it as briefly as possible, 
it consists of the Pigmies acting 
as Governors General, each aiding 
his assigned country to make the 
transformation to an environment 
ten times too large for it, with the 
Princess, Super Chief and Head 
Witch Doctor acting as Supreme 
Arbiters in disputes between coun- 
tries, which have been predictably 
few. We tiny people were over- 
whelmed by the immensity of our 
environments — our tenfold abund- 
ance of food and housing and cloth- 
ing, metals and minerals and fuels, 
and our suddenly adequate means 
of transportation — everything! 
Only the Pigmies, of all the world, 
were not stupefied by the change. 

Princess Wamba has asked me, 
What about the danger of war? To 
which I can openly reply, With 
what? Weapons we tiny people can’t 
operate? Warplanes we can’t fly? 
Besides, who needs somebody else’s 
territory and resources when sud- 
denly there is ten times as much of 
everything? 

But what about later, you ask, 
after the transition is complete? 

By that time, Pigmy rule will be 
solidly entrenched. And what Pigmy 
would let his country go to war 
against a brother Pigmy’s? 

Moreover, it’s remarkable even 
now how possessive each country 
feels about its Pigmy Governor Gen- 
eral. Why shouldn’t they? After all, 
Pigmies, being the only creatures on 
Earth who were immune to the 
moss, are the biggest people on 
Earth. 

Now doesn’t everything work out 
wonderfully?

U nderstanding 

by GEORGE O. SMITH 

Illustrated by DORFMAN 


One boy can't cope with a planet 
filled with enemies — unless he 
has a dog . and Understanding! 


I 

S cholar’s Cluster is a globular 
aggregation of about a quar- 
ter of a million stars, so young a 
cluster that it has no visible sign 
of dispersion. Its stars are heavy 
with the metals created in earlier 
novae, and the stellar population 
is high with the middle-sequence 
suns centering around Types F, 
G and K. 

More important, Scholar’s 


Cluster got its name from its own 
mysterious environment. Study- 
ing there will not make a scholar 
of a dolt nor a genius of a 
straight-A student, but studying 
there will guarantee that each 
will be educated to his maximum 
ability to absorb knowledge. 
Once this end is reached, there 
is no point in remaining — for 
exactly the same reason that one 
stops pouring when the gallon 
measure has taken on four quarts. 


137 


Scholar’s Cluster was a going 
operation when Earth attained 
the stars and took her place 
among the galactic cultures; and 
Earth, like the myriad of other 
galactic cultures, sends her 
brighest to her educational colo- 
ny on one of the pleasanter 
planets that revolves about a 
G-3 star not much different than 
Sol. 

While this is not an account 
of Scholar’s Cluster, Scholar’s 
Cluster is important to the ad- 
ventures of young Terence Lin- 
coln, for Scholar’s Cluster lies 
toward the center of the Galaxy, 
a few thousand light-years to the 
inward side of the sprawling em- 
pire of Xanabar. 

It is the existence of Scholar’s 
Cluster that placed young Ter- 
ence Lincoln on the spot in 
Xanabar. Otherwise, he would 
hardly have been so far from 
home .... 

r |" A erry Lincoln skylarked 
through the streets of Cole- 
ban, one of the capital cities of 
Xanabar, with a babble of his 
classmates. They were stopping 
over in Xanabar on their way 
home to Mother Earth. They all 
had fine grades from primary 
school and were all looking for- 
ward to the three-month vaca- 
tion before returning to enter 
secondary school: neither success, 
nor freedom, nor the City of 


Coleban itself did anything to 
dampen their exuberance. 

Lincoln and his classmates 
bracketed age fifteen. 

So all of them were on the 
verge of, but none of them had 
yet crossed, the big line between 
adolescence and maturity. That 
is, none of them had gained Un- 
derstanding. 

Without Understanding, the 
gold and the glitter of Coleban 
was pure crystal-cut of proof per- 
fect, and the stopover was simply 
a matter of imperfect spaceline 
scheduling. With Understanding, 
they would have labelled Coleban 
as a tourist trap and realized 
that the stopover was a condition 
for interstellar license through 
Xanabar so that those who pass- 
ed through could be parted from 
a measure of their wealth. 

Still, those who disdainfully 
label Coleban tinsel and damn 
the whole of Xanabar are hardly 
fair. 

For the shops of Coleban dis- 
played to their very best the most 
attractive wares of ten thousand 
worlds. The universal diamond, 
sapphire and emerald are com- 
monplace; second rate to the 
star-drop of Manark, the frau- 
land of Selira that shines of its 
own internal light or the glorious 
oyster-pearl of Earth, that is said 
to lose its luster if it does not 
lie upon the throat of a woman 
in love. There were fabrics so 


138 


GALAXY 


delicate that they could be worn 
but once and others so durable 
that they would outlast their 
makers. There were tools to fit 
the hands of a thousand worlds, 
knives that could split the hair 
or cleave plate armor with equal 
facility; instruments with gleam- 
ing dial and engraved calibration. 

And there were animated dis- 
plays. 

These caught young Terry Lin- 
coln’s eye. He was a gamesman. 
The displays were programmed 
by master artisans to show the 
finer points and the flashy parts, 
and done with an ease that con- 
vinced the onlooker that he, too, 
could gain such skill with a little 
practice. Time and again, Terry 
found himself rapt as his com- 
panions moved onward. 

And each time he had to make 
his way through a bedlam of 
humanity to regain his compan- 
ions. 

Humanity came in an assort- 
ment of sizes from a small meter 
and a half to a stalwart two me- 
ters plus, and in a bracket of 
weights to match the skinny and 
the gross in each height class. 
Humanity’s color varied from 
peppermint white to deep choco- 
late, with side flavors of saffron, 
tints of lemon and the reds from 
pale pink to ruddy. There were 
the usual superficial differences 
in the makeup of the hands and 
some startling facial arrange- 


ments, but they were all of Hu- 
manity — and they all had two 
things in common: 

They were all oxygen-breath- 
ing, water-based, hydrocarbon 
life with red blood and omnivor- 
ous appetites — and they all had 
Understanding, for Understand- 
ing is the mature way of life for 
those whose culture has attained 
the stars. 

That Terry Lincoln and his 
classmates lacked this important 
common denominator mattered 
not. His was a people who had 
attained Understanding, and he 
and his companions were on the 
verge. 

TXTithout Understanding, the 
* ' babble of tongues about 
him was babble indeed. This did 
not bother him. One day he, too, 
would attain it, and all would be- 
come clear. For this; moment of 
celebration, all babble was noise; 
and Lincoln Gdiild not have oared 
less whether the Humanity about 
him was echoing in their own way 
his own appreciation of the glit- 
ter of City Coleban or talking 
about him as an object of inter- 
est. 

Lincoln paused to watch a dis- 
play of a game that combined 
the intricacy and plotting of chess 
with the speed and precision of 
hockey played on ice. It was a 
demonstration skillfully program- 
med so that even the youths 


UNDERSTANDING 


139 



without Understanding could fol- 
low the play. 

Rapt, young Terry watched 
until the game, again by skillful 
program, came to a brilliant cli- 
max of high-speed master -moves 
that ended with one player down- 
ed in ignominious defeat. The 
close of this action was fol- 
lowed by a sales pitch in the 
tongue of Xanabar, which, of 
course, any one with Under- 
standing could follow. To Terry, 
it was babble, and so he turned 
to say — 

“That was quite a — ” 

— only to find that his com- 
panions had left him and were 
now turning the corner far along 
the street. 

Terry turned to follow. As he 
turned, the sales pitch stopped 
and a new demonstration began 
with appropriate announcements. 
His move to leave was blocked 
by a strong centripetal move- 
ment toward the exhibition. 
While he bucked this inward 
movement, his classmates turned 
the comer and were gone from 
sight. 

This bothered Terry very 
lightly; he knew he could make 
his way through this crowd and 
rejoin his companions. But the 
crowd that thronged the streets 
of Coleban had one more Human 
attribute: They were egocentric. 
They blocked his path and bark- 
ed at him in the tongues of the 


Galaxy. They did not step aside 
nor help, nor seem to care that 
he was trying to make haste for 
a very good reason. 

Indeed, there seemed a perverse 
delight in their operations, as if 
they found it pleasant to block 
this rash youth who lacked Un- 
derstanding. Openings closed as 
he approached. Strangers paused 
to speak to one another in the 
narrowest of ways. Pedestrian 
traffic, supposed to walk on the 
left by the Law of Xanabar, 
filled the right-hand pedestrian 
lanes in the wrong direction. 
That others, trying to make their 
way in Terry’s direction, were 
also blocked and frustrated did 
not make Terry’s lot any easier. 

Then came the inevitable in- 
cident. Terry espied an opening 
between two walkers and started 
through, only to plunge headlong 
into a saffron-colored man of 
gross proportions who had filled 
the gap. Terry hit and bounced 
backward to land with a jarring 
thud on the base of his spine. 

The saffron-colored one laugh- 
ed harshly, displaying a mouth 
full of disgustingly bad teeth. 
To finish this picture, the saffron- 
colored one had covered his vis- 
ibly unbathed body with one of 
the gaudiest costumes to walk the 
streets of Coleban. 

Angered, Terry Lincoln arose 
and hit the line with a plunge 
that had gained him much yard- 


UNDERSTANDING 


141 


age on the playing fields of 
Scholar’s Cluster — and once 
Wore bounced. This time the saf- 
fron-colored one kicked Terry in 
tire ribs as he stepped over the 
lad to disappear in the crowd. 

This was the last straw. It 
was time to forget that polite- 
ness was a gentlemanly trait and 
time to get where he was going. 

S tarting with a brisk walk, and 
slowly accelerating into a dog- 
trot, Terry Lincoln zigged and 
zagged and darted, making long 
end runs around phalanxes of 
people and driving himself be- 
tween others that showed no more 
than half enough space. Soon he 
was in a semi-gallop, making 
wide swings here and taking a 
shortcut through an open alley- 
way there. 

He lost his sense of direction 
and, being young, forgot the natae 
of the game he’d set out to win 
because there was a more frantic 
game at hand. Terry became 
turned around and continued to 
plunge through the crowd in the 
direction away from his local 
home base, the spaceport and its 
wall of hotels, conveniently pro- 
vided by Coleban for the enforc- 
ed lay-overs. 

He did not notice that the 
high polish was no longer about 
him, nor that the crowd was 
less dense. He had passed the 
unmarked boundary of the cen- 


ter city and was now passing 
through the borderland, that ring 
that lies between the polish and 
the blight. 

Then came the second incident. 
Once more, Terry tried to plunge 
between two who walked a bit 
apart, and once more he hit gross 
weight and bounced. 

Once more the same saffron 
face with its mouth full of rot- 
ting teeth laughed at him, but 
this time the ugly one made a 
grab for Terry, bear-hugged the 
youth and smothered Terry’s 
mouth in the foul-smelling gaudy 
garment. Terry flailed, kicked the 
other’s shins and broke free. 
Blindly Terry swung and missed. 
Then his training rose to the sur- 
face, and he squared away. He 
lfed with his left and came for- 
ward with a right cross that 
should have made its mark but 
failed to connect. Saffron-face 
countered with an open-handed 
chop that Terry blocked with 
his forearm. It stunned all feel- 
ing from lower arm and hand. 

Once more saffron-face made 
his grab, but this time Terry 
wasn’t having any. He managed 
to connect one shoulder- driven 
right jab that mashed the saf- 
fron mouth, broke off a few 
jagged stumps of the rotten 
teeth, and brought a quick flow 
of blood to the stranger’s mouth. 

Terry turned and ran, then 
made a wide curve that outdis- 


142 


GALAXY 


fenced the saffron one’s attempt 
to catch him. Terry proceeded 
once more in the direction his 
faulty sense said led toward home 
base: the spaceport and its ho- 
tels. Behind him in full chase 
came the gross one, surprisingly 
limber for that much visible flab. 

Ultimately, youth outdistanced 
the man, and Terry paused for 
breath. 

About him was slumland. 
Trash littered the sidewalks, and 
filth filled the gutter. Windows 
were nearly all cracked to some 
degree, many were broken and 
stuffed with dirty cloth, others 
were completely out and cov- 
ered from within with some sort 
of reclaimed sheeting or discarded 
building material. 

The air smelled of rancid 
grease, vegetables that had been 
cooked far too long and the un- 
clean smell of the blight area. 
Dusk had begun, and the street- 
lights had come on to cast a 
wholly incompetent, wan glow. 
Under one were street urchins 
playing at some game of dice. 
Two girls in too-tight and very 
sleazy dresses passed Terry and 
spoke to him forashly; he did not 
need Understanding to know 
what they had in mind. His si- 
lence was greeted by more vul- 
garities, which attracted the at- 
tention of the dice-players. Two, 
obviously winners, deserted the 
game for the girls. 


Still, Terry plodded on, for he 
recalled that the transit had pass- 
ed overhead of some grubby- 
looking areas on its way from 
spaceport to center city. 

And so he continued, confident 
that beyond this barrier of blight 
lay the spaceport he sought. 

II 

fTpjhe name was Homburg. On 
the wall before him was an 
illuminated map of the city, with 
tiny moving lights to show what 
action was taking place. Below 
the map were a series of small 
videoscreens with scenes of the 
city taken from marked vantage 
points. 

The special-colored 1 starred 
cross that marked the position of 
Terry Lincoln, and the thin dot- 
dash line that marked his path, 
Showed him almost diametrically 
opposite to the spaceport and 
moving away. 

Homburg pressed a button on 
his desk. On the small screen 
above the instrument the saffron- 
colored face appeared. Homburg 
said, “That was well executed, 
Bod Zimmer.” 

Zimmer said, “Zer Homburg, 
am I relieved? I wish very much 
to get out of this filthy disguise.” 

“You are relieved, Bod Zim- 
mer. You will foe rewarded.” 

A snap, and Zimmer’s face dis- 
appeared. 


UNDERSTANDING 


143 


Homburg eyed the map and 
noted that the mark that repre- 
sented Terry; was still moving 
away from center city and the 
spaceport on the far side. Satis- 
fied, he arose from his desk and 
went down the hallway outside 
to another office. He merely nod- 
ded to the secretary in the outer 
office as he stepped briskly across 
the room to the closed door. But 
it was with visible deference that 
he rapped on the inner door, 
waited perceptibly, and only after 
there was no objection turned the 
knob and entered. 

To the man behind the desk, 
Homburg said, “Zer Martell, 
phase one is completed.” 

Martell looked up. “Success- 
fully, Bod Homburg?” 

“Quite,” replied Homburg, con- 
cealing his disappointment. He’d 
hoped that this success would 
move his superior to drop the 
title bod which one used oh an 
inferior. Had this been done, 
Homburg would no longer be re- 
quired to address his superior by 
the title zer and could address 
him without title as an equal. 

CtTTery well,” said Martell. 

* “Now, whether you sleep 
tonight at all, you will remain on 
duty until the call comes from 
the Terrestrial spacecraft that one 
of their number is missing.” 
“Yes, Zer Martell.” 

“It will be routed to your of- 


fice. Take the call just as if your • 
assignment was to take such calls 
and act upon them. They need 
not know — indeed, they must 
not know that they are dealing 
with a member of the personal 
staff of the Master Peacekeeper 
of Xanabar.” 

“Yes, Zer Martell.” 

“And then, Bod Homburg, see 
that this incident is properly and 
promptly reported to the Terres- 
trial Agency at once.” 

“This will place the agent Peter 
Hawley and the dog Beauregarde 
in the operation, Zer Martell.” 
“Precisely.” 

“I fail to see — ” 

“Bod Homburg, that pair have 
a mutual Understanding that sur- 
passes any that I have ever seen. 

I hope that we may gain some 
insight into this superior Under- 
standing by separating them. 
Once the Terrestrial agent is no- 
tified and the operators move in- 
to action, you will give the signal 
to execute phase two. Under- 
stood?” 

“I will give the signal as you 
order, but I fail to understand 
why all of this is necessary.” 

“Were we to separate them by 
force, there would be repercus- 
sions. To slay one of them would 
only serve to have the slain one 
replaced by another whose way 
of operating would be unfamiliar 
to us, and it would infuriate the 
remaining one to a degree that 


144 


GALAXY 


only an irate Terrestrial can 
achieve. Now, Bod Homburg, 
were you able to understand the 
reason for this complicated oper- 
ation, you would be sitting in this 
office instead of me.” 

“Zer Martell! I would never 
think of replacing you.” 

“You never will,” said Martell 
coldly. “The day you enter this 
office will be the day I appoint 
you to it, for then I shall sit 
where Zer Doktur sits today and 
I shall still be your superior. So 
now begone and prepare for the 
next phase.” 

Yn Terrestrial terms, it would 

have been between two-thirty 
and three o’clock in the morning. 
The streets of Coleban were de- 
serted save for some cleaning wo- 
men and porters and a very few 
others. Of the masses of humani- 
ty who had come seeking their 
own particular brand of happi- 
ness, some had found it and 
others had not; in either case 
they were elsewhere. 

The “others” included a sight 
seldom seen this far from Mother 
Earth, for no other planet has 
anything 'that resembles the Ter- 
restrial canine. 

Beauregarde led, his nose close 
to the ground and his plume 
waving cheerfully as he plied one 
of his talents. He was tracking 
the scent of Young Terry Lin- 
coln. 


Beauregarde is hard to describe 
because he does not resemble 
any of the standard breeds. Dog, 
short-haired, brown with darker 
lines around the eyes, well mus- 
cled, seventy to eighty pounds. 
In short, Beauregarde the dog 
looked like a dog because his 
parents were dogs, but here the 
association with can/s vulgaris 
ceases. 

For Beauregarde had the dog’s 
version of Understanding. He was 
of a long line of dogs bred for 
Understanding and for the latent 
intelligence of the canine, instead 
of size or shape or something 
equally superficial. Understand- 
ing has been a canine trait ever 
since man and dog shared the 
campfire and divided the day’s 
kill. As a consequence, it is hardly 
surprising that Beauregarde’s 
measure of Understanding was 
greater in any area where Peter 
Hawley was concerned. 

Peter followed the dog at a lit- 
tle distance. He, too, is hard to 
describe because he, like Beaure- 
garde, is pure mongrel. Still, Peter 
Hawley carried himself with a 
j aunty air as if he owned the 
sidewalk where he trod: a lithe 
and slender thirtyish with plenty 
of bounce in his step and a smile 
on his face. The smile was either 
Cheerful rogue or downright in- 
solence depending upon which 
side the observer took with regard 
to Peter. His hair was dark sandy, 


UNDERSTANDING 


145 


and his eyes were blue. His com- 
plexion was a healthy wind-burn- 
ed tan, but mostly artificially in- 
duced since Peter’s assigned task 
was to pursue and apprehend vil- 
lains, and villainy is mostly done 
in the dark. 

The dog paused, circled tight- 
ly, resniffed and said, “Young 
Lincoln stood here for quite a 
While, shuffling back and forth 
as if he were watching some- 
thing.” 

The dog’s voice was far from 
Oxford. It was a well controlled 
whine and whinny, with chest 
sounds adding bass with a well 
modulated growl or a low rumble. 
The lips and tongue were suffi- 
ciently mobile to give fair articu- 
lation. Understanding supplied 
the remainder of Beauregarde’s 
communication system. 

Peter looked around. “The 
kid’s school file said that he was 
a bit of a gamesman. Maybe that 
one caught him.” Peter indicated 
the game that Lincoln had stop- 
ped to watch. It was dormant 
now that there were no potential 
customers, but Peter knew of the 
game and how it was displayed. 
“Anything else?” he asked Beau- 
regarde. 

“Well, the rest didn’t wait up 
for him.” 

Peter nodded. “I don’t suppose 
that educated sniffer of yours will 
tell us whether this is where they 
got separated?” 


“No. But I wouldn’t be 
against this as the place,” said 
Beauregarde. “I think I scent re- 
peaters.” 

( C O epeaters? Well, now, that 
makes it a grabbing in- 
stead of a little boy lost, and that 
makes more sense except for the 
big puzzler of why.” 

“Why?” repeated the dog. 
“Isn’t half of our job retrieving 
either Terrestrial loot or Terres- 
trials themselves that have been 
grabbed by the citizens of Xana- 
bar?” 

“Yes,” grinned Peter. “But it’s 
usually toothsome young females 
that they grab, not fifteen-year- 
old males, which are a drug on 
any flesh market.” 

“How so?” 

“Beauregarde, a youth of fif- 
teen is one hundred and thirty- 
odd pounds of misdirected ener- 
gy, walking on two left feet in 
an uncertain gait in the wrong 
direction. Its path is marked by 
a two-year trail of broken glass, 
dirty shoes, unfinished projects, 
unread books and undone home- 
work. He is as cooperative as a 
mule when anything constructive 
is needed and filled with burn- 
ing ambition when what must be 
done is completely beyond his 
capability. And — ” 

“ — in other words, who’d 
want one?” 

“That’s about it.”

“Well, there must be some 
reason. Even the citizens of 
Xanabar do not grab for the sim- 
ple sake of grabbing.” 

“You’re thinking of ransom?” 
“Well?” asked the dog. 

Peter shook his head. “Whilst 
you were getting your snoot full 
of Lincoln’s scent, I was going 
through the folder from the kid’s 
school record. There simply isn’t 
anything negotiable in Lincoln’s 
background. His folks have nei- 
ther money nor position that 
would make a caper like this 
worthwhile. Oh, young Lincoln 
is bright enough to earn a spon- 
sored ticket to Scholar’s Cluster, 
but the citizens of Xanabar 
aren’t swiping adolescent brains 
with half an education and no 
Understanding.” 

“Not without some reason,” 
insisted Beauregarde. 

“You’re a bloody pragmatist,” 
said Peter. “And you’re so right. 
That’s what bothers me.” 

“That I’m right?” 

“No. What bothers me is not 
that you’re right, but that this 
operation smells highly of some- 
thing complicated, with the bait 
concealed. Jinks, if they wanted 
to grab him, they’ve got enough 
characters in this play to fold 
up the pavement around him and 
cart him off. Instead — they play 
games. I don’t get it; what I don’t 
like is being too dense to see.” 
“So?” 


“So we walk very carefully, 
carrying our dish extremely level, 
making neither wave nor surface 
ripple until we get to the bottom 
of this mess.” 

Beauregarde gave a short bark; 
in human it would have been a 
snort. 

“Peter,” said the dog, “I lack 
the imagination to visualize the 
scene in which Peter Hawley 
handles the delicate situation 
with velvet gloves, whilst Beaure- 
garde lies with chops on fore- 
paws and watches through heavy- 
lidded eyes.” 

nphey went on — and on — and 
^ on until Beauregarde snorted 
and dog-sneezed. “Oof,” he said. 
“Your opinion of overaged fish is 
pleasantly aromatic compared to 
this.” 

“What goes?” 

“Something — someone — who 
stinks. Reeks. Awful.” 

“Humph. Well, Beau, the caper 
makes a pattern, but the prize is 
still hidden.” 

“You mean this smelly charac- 
ter makes sense?” 

“I’ll bet a nice well hung raw 
steak against one, charcoal singed 
on the outside, that this smelly 
pally was also clad in a costume 
that couldn’t be forgotten in a 
lifetime.” 

“But why?” 

“Well, observe that we are

part of Coleban. Here we have 
an incident that marks one of the 
opposition in the young man’s 
mind. Not long from now, there 
will be another, with the same 
offensive party. This will con- 
vince Lincoln that he is not a 
mere victim of circumstance, but 
the central figure in a plot. He 
will therefore take off on a dead 
gallop. Subtly the opposition will 
change their tactics and start to 
block his way in the direction 
they want him to go, leaving their 
cover loose so that he thinks he is 
gaining while all the time he is 
going in the direction they want 
him to go. Catch?” 

“Yes, but why?” 

“Well, Beau, take a look. We’re 
about to leave the area of polish- 
ed metal, reflection-free glass and 
marked-up prices. We’re on the 
edge of the honky-tonk, the 
flashy vurguzz-mill and the joint 
with the fifty beautiful hostesses, 
fifty. Unless the target is not dis- 
tracted, he will observe this dis- 
tressing side of City Coleban and 
take sensible measures. Distract- 
ed, he will plunge on and on, 
deeper and deeper into enemy 
territory.” 

“That is a lot to deduce from 
a few dog-scents,” said Beaure- 
garde. 

“Sure it is. But I’ve been in 
Xanabar long enough to figure 
out most of their operations. In 
fact, the only thing that bothers 


me is this one. With the crew, 
they have on board, simply grab- 
bing a kid should be as easy as

“ — Scratching your ear with

garde. / 

“Yeah ...” said Peter absently. 
“And even without your talented 
sniffer, I smell the unmistakable 
smell of Peacekeeper, about to 
arrive in a cloud of indignation.” 

Beauregarde made a gesture of 
sniffing at the air. “I agree,” he 
said. “And now, Peter, take your 
own advice. Treat this delicate 
situation delicately. The velvet 
gloves, remember? The level dish 
and the careful walk? I shall ob- 
serve through heavy-lidded eyes 
with jaw on poised forepaws, the 
picture of contentment.” 

“Oh, shut up!” snapped Peter. 

“Ah, how quickly passes the 
moment of passive acceptance. 
Peter, your adrenalin count is ris- 
ing admirably to this occasion. 
But please, don’t make me bite 
him. I detest the taste of raw

proached with the customary 
hail: “What goes on in Xana-

“Nothing of interest to you, 
Peacekeeper.”

“You are Peter Hawley, and 
this is the dog, Beauregarde.” 
“That is a brilliant deduction 
since we both are quite well 
known. And since we are equally 
well known as lawful folk, we 
will continue on our way.” 

“You are a troublemaker, with 
the reputation of disturbing the 
peace of Xanabar. Now, exactly 
what business brings you to the 
center of Coleban at this un- 
reasonable hour of the morning?” 
“I am walking my dog.” 

“Do not be insolentl” 

“Then do not make noises like 
an imbecile. You know damned 
well that a Terrestrial youth, 
Terence Lincoln, dropped out of 
touch in this region not too many 
hours ago.” 

“The Peacekeepers of Xanabar 
have the situation well in hand. 
We need no intervention from 
outsiders.” 

“The Peacekeepers of Xana- 
bar have the situation loused up 
as usual,” said Peter testily. 
“Any' outfit that can’t find a 
fifteen-year-old male Terrestrial 
without Understanding needs 
some outside help.” 

“Finding the missing youth is 
Peacekeeper business.” 

“Business seems to be failing. 
Now go fly your kite.” 

“You will not be permitted to 
meddle in the affairs of Xana- 
bar.” 

“We’re not meddling,” snapped 


Peter. “We’re merely doing what 
your whole outfit can’t do. So 
now get out of my way.” 

“You may not order me 
around.” 

“Want to bet?” 

“Peter,” said Beauregarde 
quietly, “remember your own ad- 
vice. Be kind to our web-footed 
friend.” 

“Ah, yes,” said Peter. “I’m 
being impulsive. We need not 
walk roughshod over the Peace- 
keepers of Xanabar, need we? 
So, since he will not stand aside 
and let us on about our business, 
we will go around. Right, Beau?” 
“Right,” said Beauregarde. The 
dog started to circle the Peace- 
keeper to one side while Peter 
circled the Peacekeeper to the 
other. He in the middle tried to 
keep his eyes on both, which 
resulted in a back-and-forth snap 
of the head as the encirclement 
increased. Finally the patience of 
the Peacekeeper blew sky high. 

“Stop this!” he shouted, reach- 
ing for his side-arm. 

Beauregarde stopped circling. 
He faced the Peacekeeper and 
dropped low into an alert crouch. 
The strong muscles stood out as 
he hunched himself for a spring; 
the scruff stood high and stiff, 
and from the deep throat came 
the growl of the Terrestrial dog 
in last-ditch warning. 

The growl disturbed the Peace- 
keeper.

Peter said, “He means that. 
You touch the pea-shooter, and 
Beauregarde will have your fore- 
arm in bloody shreds before it 
clears the holster.” 

“You dare not threaten me!” 
bellowed the Peacekeeper. 

“I’m not threatening you,” said 
Peter calmly. “I’m merely tell- 
ing you what will happen if you 
start playing with hardware.” 
“Peter,” asked Beauregarde, 
“can’t we arbitrate this? I’m not 
really hungry, and the last Peace- 
keeper I ate was stringy.” 

“Now see here — ” 

Peter waved a hand. In it was 
a banknote, a pleasantly sized 
denomination in crystal-cut, the 
currency of Xanabar. “This, 
Peacekeeper, is not a bribe, for 
I know better than to bribe the 
Peacekeepers of Xanabar. In- 
stead, it is payment for a fine in 
advance. From long experience, 
I know what it costs to cut a 
caper in Xanabar; this is pay- 
ment in advance for a bit of dis- 
turbed peace, possibly a cracked 
skull or two, and the usual treat- 
ment for numerous scars, mars, 
abrasions, shock and dogbite. I 
further offer you some good ad- 
vice. Find some overparked auto- 
mobiles to ticket on the next 
block over and stay out of 
harm’s way — ” 

In a normal flap in Xanabar, 
Peter might well have gotten 
away with it. He had before. But 


this Peacekeeper had his orders, 
and his script had been prepared 
by Zer Upstairs. 

'"TAhe mobile riot squad converg- 
-*• ed upon them like a swarm 
of locusts. They arrived in a 
squeal of tires and brakes, in the 
thunder of copter blades, the 
nerve-wracking hiss of jets; and 
the horizon-wide clangor of bells 
and whistles, the howl of two- 
toned hee-haw-horns and the 
wail of sirens. With them came 
the blinding glare of searchlight 
and parachute flare. 

Peter and the Peacekeeper 
were caught in the glare. In 
Peter’s upheld hand shone the 
unmistakable rectangles of green 
and gold, the crystal-cut of 
Xanabar. The tableau could 
hardly have been improved as it 
was, but the Peacekeeper capped 
this climax. He struck at Peter’s 
hand in visible indignation and 
shouted righteously: “You can- 
not bribe the Peacekeeper of 
Xanabar!” 

He drew back and reached for 
his side-arm. 

Beauregarde growled warn- 
ingly and crouched once more. 
But Peter Hawley said, “Play it 
cool, Beau. You track Terry Lin- 
coln, find him, keep him safe 
and bring him home alive. I’ll 
deal with this native uprising.” 

Beauregarde said, “I hear you, 
Peter. I’ll bring him home alive,

unharmed and probably with Un- 
derstanding.” 

At which point the dog turned 
swiftly and pranced away. His 
first leap was a sudden spring 
that barely grazed the Peace- 
keeper. He landed on his fore- 
paws and then folded into an 
arch that brought the hind feet 
between and before the front; 
then he unwound into a long 
arrowing bound forward. Like an 
accordion, Beauregarde alternate- 
ly folded and unfolded as he 
raced with four-footed agility 
through the dazzled members of 
the converging force. There was 
a flurry of flashguns, the hiss of 
needle beams, the throbbing 
grunt of stunners and the pulsat- 
ing shaft of nerve Shockers, but 
the Peacekeepers of Xanabar 
were hardly in practice, especial- 
ly in taking snap shots at any 
target that moved as fast as 
canus terrestrialis in a hurry. 
Beauregarde made the corner 
untouched and turned' it in a 
flurry of scrabbling paws on the 
hard pavement. Then he was 
gone. 

Beauregarde was not touched, 
but the innocent bystanders had 
not fared well. Four of the 
Peacekeepers were writhing and 
moaning on the hard pavement; 
two were clutching the burn- 
holes from needlers; and the as- 
sortment of stun-guns and nerve 
shockers had taken their toll 


from a full freeze that left the 
victim in the awkward config- 
uration of an ill-contrived statue 
toppled to earth to lesser at- 
tacks that immobilized arm, leg, 
pelvis or other mobile joints. 

Ignoring the mess his fellows 
had made of themselves by their 
marksmanship, the uniformed 
Peacekeeper advanced upon Pet- 
er Hawley. “Will you come quiet- 
ly?” he asked, in a voice that 
clearly indicated that he hoped 
that Peter might resist — ever 
so little — so that he could drill 
the Terrestrial agent and have 
him hauled in stiff. 

Peter chuckled jauntily. 
“Sure,” he said, in a tone and 
in a manner that he knew to 
make the average Peacekeeper 
long for the return of the knout, 
the scourge and the rack. “Sure,” 
he repeated. “Your office is bet- 
ter than mine to call — because 
at yours I can register a formal 
complaint. May I walk — or 
must you show your mastery of 
the situation by freezing me stiff 
and damping me in manacles 
to boot?” 

“Just come quietly,” said the 
Peacekeeper, almost able to con- 
ceal the seething boil that 
threatened to erupt. 

T Tomburg reported, “Zer Mar- 

-*■ tell, phase two is new com- 
plete. 

“As planned?”

“Almost precisely. Very few 
deviations.” 

Martel eyed his subordinate 
carefully. “And how many were 
told?” 

“Peacekeeper Veckten, of ne- 
cessity. He was essential to the 
operation. And master marks- 
men Randor and Wotane.” 
“That is all?” 

“That is all, Zer Martell.” 
“That was well done, Bod 
Homburg.” 

“Zer — ?” 

“Yes?” 

“Zer Martell, would it not be 
proper to reward — somehow — 
these who had to be dropped by 
Randor and Wotane lest they 
harm the dog Beauregarde? It 
strikes me that — ” 

“You are not thinking well, 
Bod Homburg. Those who know 
must be rewarded — unobtru- 
sively — for their performance. 
To reward those whose zealous 
defense of the Peace of Xanabar 
might have defeated our program 
would only cause puzzlement. 
Despite the odium of having 
some of our citizens think that 
we Peacekeepers are so poor in 
marksmanship that we hit our 
own instead of that devil-dog 
Beauregarde, the fewer in the 
know the better. Oh, well, just 
see — unobtrusively — that the 
victims are warmly rewarded 
upon the first time that they do 
something to warrant attention.” 


“I understand everything you 
have said so far.” 

“Good. Now, attend to phase 
three. Beauregarde and young 
Lincoln are to be harassed and 
isolated, but not harmed. I must 
have a detailed report upon their: 
operations here in Coleban.” 
“Zer?” 

“Yes?” 

“Zer Martell, you speak as if 
it were a foregone conclusion that 
the dog Beauregarde will track 
the youth Lincoln through the 
streets of Coleban, meet him and 
join forces.” 

“You are quite correct,” said 
Martell. “The idea is fantastic — 
until the record is examined. 
Peter Hawley and Beauregarde 
have an awesome record of trail- 
ing those missing persons whose 
lithe young bodies are coveted 
by some of our unruly citizens. 
I’m told that this is done by 
following the scent left by the 
person, but I’d as soon profess 
to believe in free-running tele- 
pathy. But fact is fact, and the 
record stands.” 

“And you believe that Beaure- 
garde will meet Lincoln.” 

“I may have hazarded my 
position and my future upon 
that premise, Bod Homburg, but 
believe me, I seldom gamble for 
high stakes. I may play for 
them, but I do not gamble, if 
you understand the difference in 
meaning.”

nperence Lincoln, witE the full, 
misplaced confidence that he 
was on the right trail, walked 
deeper and deeper into the slum- 
fold of Coleban, fully convinced 
that not far beyond this squalor 
was the spaceport. His watch, set 
to the local chronology at the 
spaceport as he and his com- 
rades debarked, told him that his 
spacecraft had taken off. That 
bothered him not. His was the 
confidence of the brash youth 
whose experience is not extensive 
enough to convince him that 
there are things of which he 
damned well might be afraid. 

So he walked onward, with a 
fair sense of direction now that 
he was no longer heckled — t hi s 
fair sense of direction keeping 
him on the proper course albeit 
in the wrong direction. 

He had, as he saw it, two 
alternatives. He could either con- 
tinue until he made it all the 
way to the spaceport, or he 
could meet up with one of the 
gaudily uniformed Peacekeepers 
of Xanabar. In either case, it 
would be no more than a mere 
explanation of his plight, a time 
check the veracity of his tale 
of woe, and then a quick re- 
turn to his former status — ■ 
otie or two ships of passage be- 
hind and a fine story to em- 
bellish in the retelling. 


Even in the slumland of Cole- 
ban, one cannot wander on for- 
ever without encountering a 
Peacekeeper, even though the 
Peacekeepers of Xanabar gener- 
ally stay where the action is. 

And so young Terry espied one 
of the gold-braided Keepers of 
Xanabar’s Peace and took heart. 
For Terry had been taught that 
policemen were as dedicated to 
the business of helping those in 
need as they were to the game 
of pursuing the ungodly. That he 
lacked Understanding was a 
point in his favor, for the Peace- 
keeper should realize that he 
was an outlander who needed 
help. 

With the ingrained ability of 
the public servant to turn in 
the wrong direction, the Peace- 
keeper rounded a comer instead 
of turning and coming toward 
Terry. The lad broke into a run 
lest he lose sight of the public 
protector. He rounded the cor- 
ner in a dead run, caught right 
of the uniform and raced on- 
ward until he almost skidded into 
the backside of the Peacekeeper. 

The Peacekeeper turned at the 
sound of the running feet. He 
turned to face the oncoming Ter- 
ry, and he smiled. 

And Terry Lincoln came to a 
sliding halt, reversed his direction 
adroitly, and then proceeded to 
use his best high-speed energy. 

For the Peacekeeper, in the 


UNDERSTANDING 


153 


full regalia of a middlearchy of 
Xanabar’s force, was none other 
than saffron-face. He had been 
relieved of his odious role and re- 
stored to rank, but there was no 
change in his face, his attitude, 
or his demeanor. 

A s Terry raced away, the 
Peacekeeper’s hand-whistle 
shrilled, and the shout he de- 
livered did not need any Under- 
standing to decipher. 

Once more, Terry eluded a 
group that swarmed down to en- 
circle him. He raced through the 
slumland of Coleban with an ease 
that carried him out of their 
hands, but as he went, he realized 
the very uncomfortable but obvi- 
ous truth : someone was after him. 

He was Target For Tonight. 

When he was again free of pur- 
suit, he paused to think. What 
they wanted of him he could not 
imagine, but the fact remained. 
It occurred to him that he could 
not appeal to Authority, since 
Authority in the uniform of the 
Peacekeepers seemed to be an 
active part of this ploy. His na- 
ture was to rail against them, to 
label the operation a senseless, 
stupid plot. But a glimmering of 
reason entered, at least long 
enough to let him understand 
that a large organization does not 
play senseless, stupid games. 
They had something to gain, else 
they would not play. 


It came as a blow to him to 
realize that he could not in con- 
fidence call upon the protection 
of the Peacekeepers of Xanabar. 
It cut fifty per cent of his future; 
he had left only the process of 
continuing on and on and on 
through this wilderness of broken 
window and rotten timber and 
decayed brick until he reached 
the spaceport that lies some Ter- 
restrial kilometers beyond the 
outskirts of the city. 

He found a sidewalk stair with 
an under-part ungraciously up- 
holstered with ragged mattress 
and tattered' blanket. Their dirt 
was offensive; but with the natur- 
al philosophy that the altitude of 
fastidiousness depends inversely 
upon the need, Terry Lincoln hit 
the very smelly hay. 

His occupancy of a favorite as- 
signation spot for the local juven- 
iles of slumland Coleban was not 
as disliked as it might have been. 
Most of the would-be users had 
been homeless themselves and 
sympathized with the unknown 
who slept where they would lie. 
They found other accommoda- 
tions and felt superior because 
they, now, were better off than he. 

Y oung Lincoln awoke with the 
coming of true light; that is, 
shortly after dawn. Strangely, the 
fact of his plight was secondary 
to a long-established ritual now 
unavailable. 


154 


GALAXY 


First, of course, was the ab- 
sence of clean clothing, to say- 
nothing of the absence of clean 
underclothing. Further, he’d slept 
in his clothing, and this made 
them even more odious. He could 
have cheerfully skipped the 
morning bath at home or at 
school, especially when something 
interesting was up, but now that 
he was absolutely denied any op- 
portunity to bathe, his body felt 
dusty, his skin crawled with 
imagined vermin and he was 
certain that he reeked of un- 
washed human flesh and stale 
perspiration. Second — but this 
quickly forged ahead and became 
foremost — his tongue and teeth 
felt furry and coated. Deep 
inside, Terry felt a vague unease; 
he knew academically that his 
teeth would hardly fall out after 
missing one brushing, but his 
training refuted the facts. So at 
this part of his awakening, Ter- 
ry would have accepted the ra- 
tion of water to brush his teeth 
instead of washing his body. 

Then came thirst. And the ra- 
tion of water would have been 
poured down his gullet. For he 
had traveled far, through dusty 
city streets; and he had slept in 
quite unpleasant quarters in an 
atmosphere that reeked of rot 
and filth and decay. 

Finally, he was hungry. He’d 
missed dinner the night before; 
and whereas he’d have been hap- 


py to forego dinner to partake of 
something interesting, the fact 
that he was denied made his hun- 
ger grow as he thought about the 
prospects. He could have missed 
a meal or several without any 
adverse effect other than the psy- 
chology involved in being denied. 

With but minor complaint he 
endured the discomfort of not 
having a comb. The lack of a 
urinal bothered him only long 
enough to espy a drain-grille in 
the concrete flooring of his be- 
low-stairs hideaway and long 
enough to make sure no one was 
about to catch him in the act. 

And then came the realization 
that hungry or no, bath or not, 
he had distance to cover. He real- 
ized then, for the first time in 
his life, that he was surely on 
his own, and that he would most 
likely be on his own until he, 
himself, managed to make his 
way from where he was to where 
he wanted to be. That the com- 
forts of life were his to attain — 
once he gained them. 

He had one advantage over 
his operation of yesterday. To- 
day, having slept in his clothing 
and having been denied his morn- 
ing ablutions, Terry Lincoln 
looked more like a youth of ten- 
ement slumland. 

With no backward glance, Ter- 
ry left his hideaway and with a 
wary eye peeled to catch the 
gaudy uniform of the Peace-

keeper of Xanabar he began once 
more to make his way through 
squalor and filth toward the 
spaceport. He aimed as he be- 
lieved to be right, and his aim 
was good, for he was on the 
same course as he’d been the 
night before. 

But Martel! and Homiburg had 
turned him about neatly. They 
watched as reports came in, and 
as their clerks posted colored 
pinpoints on the illuminated 
maps and added, lengths of illum- 
inated line to mark Terry’s 
course. 

With deep interest — separated 
by the protocol into their own 
offices — Martell and Homburg 
watched the progress of the Ter- 
restrial dog Beauregarde, as he 
followed the trail. That the dog’s 
highly trained nose could separ- 
ate the scent of a fellow Terres- 
trial was highly improbable. They 
laid this feat to a superior form 
of Understanding; an affinity to- 
ward a fellow Terrestrial that 
might well fail if Beauregarde 
were asked to track say, a Cres- 
pian. 

V 

npie first missed meal — like 
the first hundred years — 
is the hardest. If missing a meal 
sharpens the wits, it is the wit 
to petty larceny that is sharp- 
ened, for the hungry conscience 


finds little to reproach for a 
swiped breakfast. 

Two things worked in Lin- 
coln’s favor. First, he was in a 
district where the food merchants 
expected to lose a fair slice of his 
wares — and hoped sincerely that 
those who stole were truly in 
need. And second, his fumbling, 
inept attempts at comestible 
kleptomania were happily cov- 
ered over by an outburst of cus- 
tomer indignation over some 
overcharge or underservice or 
soft spots in the hard cheese. 
With clerk, manager and custo- 
mer in a full-throated round of 
hand-waving billingsgate and 
threats to call upon the Peace- 
keepers from either side of the 
mangle, Terry Lincoln found it 
easy to grab a hand full of fruit, 
some slices of cheese, and a few 
other odds and ends that were 
taken simply because they were 
available. 

It was hardly a balanced diet, 
but Terry was a fifteen-year-old 
human and, as Humanity knows 
from the Galactic Center to the 
oscillating dusters, this has the 
appetite of a bottomless pit, the 
metabolism of a blast furnace. 

And so he staved off starva- 
tion — and fairly well, for the 
lack of the formal breakfast still 
remained in his mind, while at 
the same time he was running a 
continuous snack-theft as the op- 
portunity came.

GALAXY 


Twenty miles a day is a fair 
trek for the seasoned traveller 
through wilderness. Lincoln hard- 
ly had to hack his way through 
jungle with a machete, but the 
pitfalls of running afoul took 
their own toll. For example, he 
knew that breaking out into a 
dead run would bring trouble. 
And so by nightfall on the sec- 
ond eve, Lincoln was still mak- 
ing his way in the wrong direc- 
tion. 

T>y nightfall, Terry had passed 
beyond the ring of filth and 
squalor that was characteristic 
of the blight area. His surround- 
ings were now quieter, sedate, 
with a nostalgic touch of days 
that had been, but now long gone, 
glory. It was an area in its dot- 
age, remembering the past alone 
for it had no future but to fall 
into the widening circle of blight. 
Its present was no more than 
the dull state of transition from 
an active and fruitful past to a 
deadly sordid loss of all value. 

Finding a place to sleep was 
a problem here. This was no 
neighborhood where gangs of de- 
linquents roamed to meet and 
choose up sides to find their 
pleasure where it was to be found. 
The neighborhood was old, but 
it was clean, and it looked clean 
and it smelled clean. Just as 
there was no trash in the gut- 
ter, there was no crypt below 


the stairs, upholstered with cast 
off blanket and mattress. 

The lack of a ready-made pad 
did not bother Terry as much as 
it might have. He did not, of 
course, analyze his feelings about 
the matter. But the behaviorist 
would have used the situation to 
demonstrate the value of exper- 
ience. Last night, in sheer fatigue, 
Terry had found lodging when he 
needed it. Call it, if you must, 
luck. Today, he had survived an 
hostile environment; he had eaten 
and he had maintained his free- 
dom and, although his sense of 
direction was wrong, he felt that 
he had made progress. 

Terry Lincoln, for the first 
time tossed out on his own, had 
passed his first twenty-four 
hours in the jungle. And it has 
been said that a human, physical- 
ly weak compared to his animal 
contemporaries and poorly en- 
dowed with tooth, nail, claw and 
grown-on fur coat, can be drop- 
ped anywhere that life exists and 
emerge as Master so long as he 
can survive the first diurnal per- 
iod. 

Terry had never heard this 
statement. But in his mind to- 
morrow was a new day, and since 
he’d survived this one, he would 
survive tomorrow. 

The hours of the night passed 
along, and with them went some 
of Terry’s self-confidence. Again, 
without his realizing it, he was 


UNDERSTANDING 


157 


almost desperate; he was forced 
to take his chance with what wag 
available. He had no choice. He 
was forced by big circumstance 
to make do. 

Making do was chancy. With- 
out a ready-made, under-the- 
stairs assignation-pad to preempt 
throughout the entire district, 
Terry was forced to seek an alter- 
native. There were many, none of 
them truly safe. The district was 
old in the years of the city; it 
sported the houses of elder gran- 
deur now on their way to seed or 
to be broken into half-sized 
rooms for mass dwelling. These 
relics of olden graciousness were 
equipped with the wide verandah, 
with the broad swing, the chaise, 



glider, patio lounge or sofa pro- 
vided for the afternoon or eve- 
ning relaxation. 

It was a vagrant’s choice. Terry 
could either go on, on, on and on 
until he dropped, or he could 
take the chance of being found 
by a late homeeomer or an early 
riser. The world was still not his 
to run. 

So that night he slept on a 
chaise that was at least a gener- 
ation older than he. But it was 
comfortable and clean. 

'T'erry’s awakening was not at 
the hands of an irate house- 
holder, but of his own. As dawn 
grayed the sky, his internal alarm 
clock, set early to avoid the early 
morning discovery, ran fast 
through subconscious anxiety. It 
rang long before there was any 
real danger of being discovered 
by the normal citizen of the area. 

He had been discovered by an- 
other. On the floor beside the 
chaise lay Beauregarde. 

Beauregarde was a tired dog. 
He had been at his tracking with- 
out sleep since Peter Hawley had 
Shouted the order to find Terry, 
bring the kid to Understanding 
and return him whole. Beaure- 
garde was a loyal dog, and his 
master’s order was dog’s law. 
Then, having trailed the youth 
to this pad, Beauregarde used 
sensible Wgffe to conclude that 
part two of the order could wait 


158 


GALAXY 


until both of them were awake. 
Having found Terry, Beaure- 
garde took time for sleep; it had 
been a long day for him too. 

But as young Lincoln began to 
stir, Beauregarde came wide 
awake. He yawned with a splen- 
did display of dog teeth, stretched 
fore and hind quarters, passed a 
forepaw over his nose and sat on 
his haunches, looking at Terry 
Lincoln. In fair imitation of Peter 
Hawley’s frequent sally when 
finding one of Earth’s misplaced, 
he asked, “Terence Lincoln, I 
presume?” 

Terry recognized Beauregarde 
for what he was : Terrestrial dog, 
and undoubtedly here on Coleban 
as part of the Terrestrial Office. 
His own name, in the dog’s mod- 
ulated whine and controlled 
growl, was quite recognizable to 
the youth, but the rest was whol- 
ly lost even though the dog used 
a Terrestrial dialect quite close 
to Lincoln’s own. 

It was, of course, one thing to 
know that such as the intelligent 
dog existed and that intelligent 
dog was a great help to his mas- 
ter. It was something again to 
meet one face to face. A ibit puz- 
zled how to begin, Terry nodded 
and said, “I’m Terry Lincoln, and 
somehow I’m lost.” 

The dog waved his plume and 
replied, “I am Beauregarde. I be- 
long to Peter Hawley, the chief 
troublemaker in Coleban.” 



“Beauregarde — Peter Hawley 
— the what — ?” 

“Sorry. You have not Under- 
standing,” said Beauregarde, 
speaking as slowly and as clearly 
as he could. “I am Beauregarde. 
Peter Hawley is my master. Peter 
Hawley is the Terrestrial agent 
here in Coleban. We work to- 
gether. I — er — let’s get out of 
here!” 

The simple phrases got 
through, and the urgency of the 
last one was quite clear. Without 
asking why, Terry followed the 
dog out of the place onto the 
sidewalk; he found out why a 
moment later when a man ap- 
peared on the spot they’d left, 

159 


UNDERSTANDING 


4 4 j T ow did you know”? asked 
Terry. 

“Scent,” said the dog. “He 
smelled of trouble.” 

“I didn’t hear you . ” 

“I — smelled ■ — him — com- 
ing,” said Beauregarde, as slowly 
and as clearly as he could. To 
add communication, the dog lift- 
ed his nose high and sniffed audi- 
bly. The communication of sound 
and pantomime got through to 
Terry, who nodded. 

It became evident to Terry 
that theirs was a one-way com- 
munication link. The dog had 
Understanding. He had not. 
Therefore the dog could under- 
stand him, but he could not com- 
pletely understand the dog. Since 
the dog could understand him, he 
said, “Let’s go.” 

They reached the corner, and 
Terry turned to continue in the 
direction he thought to foe toward 
the spaceport. “It can’t foe far,” 
he said. 

“What — ■ can’t -—be — far?” 
“The spaceport.” 

“It’s on the other side of Cole- 
ban,” said Beauregarde. 

“Er — huh, please?” 

“Sorry. Spaceport — is ■ — on 
— other side of city.” 

“But it should be right out 
here — ?” 

“No. You — ■ got turned — ■ 
around.” 

“Okay,” said Terry resolutely. 
“Let’s go.” 


He about faced and began to 
walk toward the center of Cole- 
ban, The dog puzzled for a mo- 
ment and then said, “Stop!” 
Terry stopped, puzzlement in 
his face. “Look, Beauregarde, I 
want to get back to the space- 
port.” 

“Right ■ — smack - — through 
Coleban?” 

“Why not?” 

“Won’t make it.” 

“Why not?” 

“Coleban — won’t let you. 
Us.” 

Beauregarde sat on his haun- 
ches. Like his master, he was big 
for action and little for the pussy- 
foot operation. Diplomacy was 
the show of fang and the sound 
of the deep-throated snarl and 
the canine willingness to tackle 
anything organic enough to bleed 
when bitten. Dimly to the dog’s 
ability to think in terms of in- 
trigue came the hard-to-follow 
logic that the Peacekeepers of 
Xanafoar had some unknown rea- 
son for herding the kid out of 
town and isolating him. Certain- 
ly the youth’s present freedom 
did not represent the inability of 
a planetful of trained operators 
to put the arm on an outlander 
who lacked Understanding. 

With little hope of reaching 
the meaning or the reason, Beau- 
regarde came to the conclusion 
that they were fairly safe from 
the clutches of the Peacekeepers 


160 


GALAXY 


so long as they did not attempt 
to beat their way through the 
city to the spaceport. 

With extreme patience, the dog 
said, “Terry, try to understand 
me. We must make our way to 
the spaceport by the roundabout 
way.” 

“But can’t you help me?” 

“I can help,” said Beauregarde 
quite clearly. “I can see that you 
are not molested nor harmed. I 
can not slip you into an inside 
pocket and smuggle you through 
the lines of the ungodly.” 

“I don’t understand,” 

T>eauregarde took in a deep 
breath and let it out in a 
dog-sigh. “That’s the problem,” 
he said. “You haven’t yet got 
Understanding. If you had, this 
would make sense to you — 
probably more sense than it does 
to me.” 

Of this, Terry grasped little 
more than the obvious statement 
that he lacked Understanding. 

“Well,” said Beauregarde, eye- 
ing the youth, “Peter said that 
I’d have to bring you to Under- 
standing before we would beat 
our way through this mess.” 
“Understanding?” asked Terry. 
“You — need — Understand- 
ing.” 

“And you can bring it to me?” 
“No — . I can not. But I — 
can — bring you to Understand.” 
The difference was lost on Ter- 


ry. He had never heard of either 
Mahomet or the Mountain, and 
so whither went thither was 
neither an issue nor a puzzle- 
ment. It simply did not exist. 

To Terry, the acquisition of 
Understanding was to follow 
something like a comprehensive 
final test, or passing a stipulated 
age ... or something he did not 
understand. It was, in fact, the 
last. It is impossible to explain 
Understanding to he who has it 
not and quite unnecessary to 
mention it to he who has it. 

“Look,” said Terry, “Why 
don’t we barge in and throw our 
weight around?” 

Beauregarde looked at Terry. 
The kid was speaking the lan- 
guage known best to both Beau- 
regarde and Peter Hawley, but 
the process of tying into a pla- 
toon of the Peacekeepers re- 
quired more than Understanding. 
It required a lot of practice and 
well integrated teamwork. It also 
required the like of Peter Hawley 
to quarterback the operation, for 
Peter had the timing, the play, 
the gimmick and the right tone 
of voice to cut this kind of mus- 
tard. 

Without Understanding, Terry 
was not going to be of any help. 
With it, Terry and Beauregarde 
could communicate; and al- 
though there could be but one 
Peter Hawley in Beauregarde’s 
life and admiration, Terry with 


UNDERSTANDING 


161 


Understanding could be a big 
help to Beauregarde and his 
grasp of the way Peter Hawley 
might have operated in the same 
circumstance. 

The dog faced Terry and said, 
“I can — help you. But you — 
will find me — a responsibility. 
First — I must be fed.” 

This Terry managed to follow. 
The concept of a predatory car- 
nivore taking his food where he 
caught it was for the dictionary, 
the encyclopedia and the course 
in paleontology and primitive life 
that he might be forced to take 
at Scholar’s Cluster next semes- 
ter. Domestic animals were fed. 

He said, “If you’re hungry, 
we’ll have to steal food, you 
know.” 

“Yes,” said Beauregarde. “But 
how?” 

“Yes — but — What?” 

“How — are we — going to 
steal — this food?” 

Terry Lincoln looked at Beau- 
regarde. He saw a short-haired 
animal of about eighty-odd 
pounds in his own estimation, 
standing a bit more than, a half- 
meter at the shoulder. One thing 
occurred to him: This Terrestrial 
dog was harder and faster than 
he, so the fast footwork belonged 
to the dog. So he said, “I’ll make 
some sort of a fuss, and while 
they are looking at me, you grab 
something to eat.” 

“Good boy,” said Beauregarde. 


VI 

'Tphey approached the market 
from opposite sides. The boy 
was inconspicuous except for his 
disheveled appearance, which 
was out of place in this district. 
The dog was as conspicuous as 
a billboard, for Xanabar had no 
such four-footed animal, but 
Beauregarde kept his identity 
concealed by animal tactics until 
the action began. 

The operation backfired. 

The unkempt youth was ob- 
viously one of Xanabar’s great 
underprivileged. His actions also 
indicated that he was not quite 
bright. So if this benighted youth 
was forced to steal his food, com- 
mon decency required that he be 
fed, and neither merchant nor 
customer felt moved to raise an 
outcry. Instead, they treated Ter- 
ry’s fumbling attempts at shop- 
lifting to the backside observa- 
tion. Those who could not turn 
their backs managed, somehow, 
to be looking over there, or up 
here, or down there; anywhere 
but at the youth who hoped to 
create a stir. 

However, the stir was created 
by Beauregarde. 

The dog was by no means un- 
known to the people of Coleban 
although less than one out of a 
thousand had ever seen him in 
the flesh. The only dog in this 
part of the Galaxy, Beauregarde 


162 


GALAXY 


had appeared in picture and vid- 
eo as a member of the Terrestrial 
Office. 

But as Terry had realized, 
knowing that such a thing as Ter- 
restrial dog existed and meeting 
the animal were two different 
items on the agenda. 

Beauregarde swooped in with 
his headlong gallop, hindpaws 
scissoring in front of the forepaws 
for the spring, then the stretch 
for distance. It was a magnifi- 
cent sight, a spectacle of animal 
in full flight. Unfortunately for 
any plan made by Terry Lincoln, 
the citizens of Coleban bent their 
attention to the dog. There were 
“oohs!” and “ahs!” as the dog 
went racing through, but not one 
of them moved aside or made 
the expected opening. 

Beauregarde was barricaded 
from the counter by spectators. 

It remained to Terry Lincoln 
to remember what they were 
there for. Since things had gone 
in reverse — including the eyes 
of the onlookers, Terry found it 
easy to latch onto a fair grab of 
edibles. 

And he remembered. Beaure- 
garde was the hungry one. So 
Terry loaded up on stuff that 
looked as though it would satisfy 
the dog’s appetite. 

“A fine haul,” said Beaure- 
garde, “but did you remember to 
snatch a can opener as well?” 

The words were lost on Terry, 


but the facts were quite plain. 
Much of the fodder Terry had 
grabbed was brilliantly labeled in 
seven-color stereograms that 
made the mouth water. These 
tidbits were encased in a contain- 
er carefully designed to withstand 
any invasionary force that was 
not equipped with the special de- 
vice furnished by the company 
that sold the food. Animal tooth 
and nail were ineffective; and 
whereas a mechanic might breach 
one of the containers, Terry was 
totally without tools. 

So Terry shared his own food 
with the dog, mentally kicking 
himself for being so thoughtless. 

Beauregarde, on the other 
hand, let Terry divide his food. 
Beauregarde was quite capable of 
foraging for his own, and he was 
far from lazy, but the main task 
was to bring the youth to Under- 
standing, and this was one way to 
do it. 

"f TTith this simple act, their, 
’ ’ roles reversed — or more 
properly, were rightfully estab- 
lished. 

Terry saw in Beauregarde an 
end to his problem of being lost, 
strayed or stolen. Indeed, he 
might have remained so, ulti- 
mately gaining Understanding in 
the gutters of Coleban as many 
the Xanabarian youth did. But 
with the arrival of Beauregarde, 
he was no longer alone. He was 


UNDERSTANDING 


163 


part of a “they” relationship or; 
companionship. 

But if Terry expected Beaure- 
garde to lead him through Cole- 
ban, either boldly through the 
serried lines of the Peacekeepers 
or stealthily through the shadows 
of night, he was mistaken, 

Beauregarde was not a minis- 
tering angel. Beauregarde was a 
weapon; a trained dog of war. 
When he walked the streets of 
Coleban or any other city in the 
sprawling galactic empire of Xan- 
abar, some feared him and some 
admired him; but all of them 
knew that this was dog, Terres- 
trial dog, intelligent Terrestrial 
dog. And any person who travel- 
led with Terrestrial dog was him- 
self a Terrestrial, of Earth, Sol 
III. And like any weapon, Beau- 
regarde served two purposes. 
Calm and unruffled, he was a 
potent force but not very useful 
in the unviolent run of life. 
Aroused, he was an unsheathed 
menace, and the sensible tiling 
was to see that Beauregarde was 
not angered, that his master was 
not angered. For it was well 
known that Terrestrial dog would 
not hesitate to charge into com- 
pletely unreasonable odds at the 
order of his master. 

As a travelling companion, 
Beauregarde was tops. But as an 
asset to Terry Lincoln’s hope of 
being returned immediately to 
home and fireside, Beauregarde 


became a first-class responsibil- 
ity, 

Beauregarde could not manipu- 
late the handle on a water-bub- 
ble. Beauregarde could not open 
doors. Beauregarde could not 
walk unnoticed along the side- 
walks of Coleban, although Terry 
could so long as no one accosted 
him. Even before Beauregarde ar- 
rived, Terry had learned that the 
way to walk unnoticed through 
a city full of strangers is to walk 
quietly and utter not a sound. 
Open the yap and utter a word, 
and all around you know you for 
what you are: An outlander. 

T he days passed. Beauregarde 
was not the total loss he said 
he would be; the dog knew his 
way around, and he had the dog’s 
Understanding. Beauregarde also 
had a fine sense of direction, and 
he knew City Coleban. So Beau- 
regarde did the navigating and 
Terry followed the dog’s direc- 
tions and suggestions. Slowly they 
were circling the central city, 
making their way through the 
roughly annular transition area 
that sprawled between the blight- 
that-was and the blight-to-be. 

Their days and nights were 
copies of one another. They 
awoke in the morning and found 
water for drinking and a meager 
washing. They stole food in a 
process that became more and 
more refined as they gained prac- 


164 


GALAXY 


tice. They walked, Terry openly 
along busy streets; Beauregarde 
racing through alleyways and 
gangways and backways so he 
would not call attention to the 
youth by his very presence. 

Terry once suggested that they 
travel by night. At this, Beaure- 
garde snowed the youth with a 
flurry of objections, none of 
which Terry could wholly under- 
stand — other than the funda- 
mental concept that they were 
objections complete with valid 
argument to support them. The 
basic idea, Terry managed to 
grasp, was that he could easily 
mingle with the people of Cole- 
ban by day, whereas by night 
there would always be the unex- 
pected watcher who would find 
it interesting for fair or foul rea- 
sons to note that a youth alone 
was walking through the neigh- 
borhood in the middle of the 
night. 

So they traveled by day, with 
Terry walking from checkpoint to 
checkpoint located by Beaure- 
garde, who operated as a scout. 

nphcir progress was marked in 
fine detail by pinpoint lights 
and glowing stripline on the huge 
illuminated map of City Coleban. 
Their progress would have grati- 
fied Peter Hawley, but it was far 
from satisfactory to the watchers 
of City Coleban. 

“When will the youth gain Un- 


derstanding?” groaned Homburg. 

“They seem to have worked out 
a routine that makes it unneces- 
sary,” said Martell. “Not even 
Doktur gave a thought to the pos- 
sibility that Beauregarde, the dog, 
could lead young Terence Lin- 
coln through the streets of City 
Coleban without first bringing the 
youth to Understanding.” 

“May I offer a suggestion, Zer 
Martell?” 

“A solution?” 

“No, zer. Just a possible ex- 
planation.” 

“Go ahead, Bod Homburg.” 

“Zer, possibly the dog, Beaure- 
garde, is too capable for our pur- 
pose. He does not need a youth 
with Understanding to act for 
him.” 

“An acceptable explanation,” 
nodded Martell. “No doubt a 
lesser dog might have turned the 
trick. But — ” and Martell twist- 
ed his face in a sour smile — 
“Beauregarde is the only dog in 
all of Xanabar.” He thought 
deeply for a full minute. Finally 
he took a deep breath and said, 
“Bod Homburg, their way must 
be made more difficult. You know 
What to do.” 

“I do indeed, Zer Martell.” 
VII 

M orning came as usual, and 
Beauregarde and Terry 
came awake shortly after dawn.

They drank at a bubbly fountain, 
and washed in the water of a 
small lagoon in a tiny park that 
still retained some of the long- 
gene elegance of the day when 
this district was strictly for the 
ruling class of Coleban. 

The pair killed time until the 
customary store-opening hour by 
sauntering through the merchan- 
dising district and casing the 
stores and supermarkets for a 
likely source of food. 

When the stores began to fill 
with, customers, they made their 
usual play. It was, by now, a 
well rehearsed program. They en- 
tered from opposite sides, and as 
usual the very presence of Beau- 
regarde created excitement. Some 
of &.e citizens were petrified with 
fright at the proximity of the ani- 
mal, others were fascinated, still 
others wanted to move in close 
so they could tell their friends 
about the incident. With all at- 
tention distracted, Terry made 
his haul from the open shelves — 

Or rather, he began to. 

He was in the midst of filling 
a small sack with choice grocer- 
ies when one of Xanabar’s Peace- 
keepers in the full glittering regal- 
ia appeared behind him and laid 
a heavy hand on his shoulder. 
Terry whirled, twisting his 
shoulder out of the Peacekeeper’s 
grip by ducking his head under 
the Peacekeeper’s arm and plung- 
ing away at an angle. 


“Halt! Halt in the name of 
Xanabar!” To back up his order, 
the Peacekeeper’s hand slid to- 
ward the stunner in its holster. 

And at the same moment, 
Beauregarde came around the 
corner of the counter on a dead 
run. The dog slid to a crouching 
stop beside the Peacekeeper and 
emitted an ugly-sounding snarl. 
“Stop right there, Peacekeeper,” 
growled the dog. “Draw that 
thing and you’ll lose your hand 
at the wrist.” 

Terry stopped at the sound of 
Beauregarde’s first deep-throated 
snarl; he turned to face them. 
The Peacekeeper whirled to face 
the dog. “You are the Terrestrial 
dog, Beauregarde.” 

“You are so right. I am.” 

“You may not threaten the 
peace of Xanabar.” 

“If you were capable of keep- 
ing it, which both I and my 
master doubt — or willing to try, 
which we question — neither I 
nor my master would be required 
in Xanabar.” 

“You may not criticize — ” 
“Stop it, Peacekeeper,” said the 
dog. “The very fact that I am 
here is proof enough that some- 
one in your upper office is play- 
ing games. Otherwise young Ter- 
ence Lincoln would have been 
found and returned to the space- 
port instead of being harried and 
chased and herded from one slum 
to another and forced to steal.” 


166 


GALAXY 


“There are no slums in Xana- 
bar.” 

“Call them ‘Points of historic 
interest,’ then,” said Beauregarde. 

“This is the missing Terrestrial 
youth, Terence Lincoln?” 

“You call it ‘Missing,’ but we 
call it something else.” 

“This is the missing person. He 
is also a thief. He must answer to 
the Justice of Xanabar.” 

“That’s what you think,” said 
Beauregarde with a snarl. “Terry 
has had enough of the so-called 
Justice of Xanabar to last him a 
lifetime. Now if your justice were 
real and honest, you would escort 
us to the spaceport and make cer- 
tain that this youth is properly 
restored to those who will see him 
home to Mother Earth.” 

“You cannot conceal his thiev- 
ing under a cloak of false right- 
eousness! Nor may you impute 
that Xanabar renders false justice 
when we take a thief to jail in- 
stead of releasing him to fly free 
and clear. He must answer to — ” 

tC/^yh, knock it off,” snapped 
^ Beauregarde. “Terry and I 
will go out of here in one piece 
and on our feet, whether you live 
to tell your family about it or 
not. Now stand aside and don’t 
put a hand on that stunner — 
or we’ll find out how fast we are, 
you and I.” 

“You cannot threaten — ” 

“I already have. Now, if you 


want to try your skill against my 
speed, start reaching. Go ahead, 
draw it. Start now. I’ll have plen- 
ty of time to take you after you 
start. Make your play first — ” 

“Look out!” shouted Terry. 
With a single, whirling motion, 
the youth turned, scooped up a 
container of something handy in 
size and shape and hardness, and 
hjUrled it in a bullet-throw over 
the dog’s back into the face of 
what looked like an ordinary citi- 
zen pf City Coleban. 

But the ordinary citizen was far 
from ordinary, for truly ordinary 
citizens do not carry minibeams 
in the breast pocket ordinarily 
reserved for pens and pencils. 

The hard canister caught the 
citizen across the bridge of the 
nose. The rim bit deep as bone 
splintered. No will of iron was 
ever strong enough to prevent 
the reaction; pain and shock re- 
moved all plan for action from 
the man’s mind. By reaction, his 
hand opened and let the mini- 
beam drop as he raised the hand 
to his face in the instinctive ges- 
ture. 

Beauregarde leaped, caught the 
falling minibeam in his moiith, 
and with a sharp snap of ■ his 
powerful neck, he hurled it 
against die face of the counter 
beside/ him. It hit and smashed 
with an ear-splitting crack! and 
a blinding flash of light as its 
bottled power went radiant.

In the excitement, the Peace- 
keeper managed to draw his stun- 
ner and was bringing it to bear 
on Beauregarde. 

“Hit him low!” barked the dog 
as he leaped for the Peacekeeper’s 
throat. 

Terry plunged forward in a 
football tackle, hitting the Peace- 
keeper several inches lower than 
any referee would have allowed. 
But this was no game and neither 
was it time to behave like a gen- 
tleman. 

The Peacekeeper went over in 
a tangle, his legs cut out from un- 
der him by the flying tackle, and 
his topside completely over- 
whelmed by the mass of the dog, 
who hit him at the throat. There 


was little bloodshed. Beauregarde 
merely nicked the soft flesh, but 
he kept that throat between his 
fangs until the Peacekeeper had 
time to realize just what the dog 
could have done. 

Then with a gesture calculated 
to live in the humility of the 
Peacekeeper for the rest of his 
life, Beauregarde slurped the man 
from the chin to hairline with a 
large, soggy, rough-surfaced ton- 
gue-of-dog. “Your’re dead,” he 
said. “Lie down and be counted.” 

Then the dog looked at Terry. 
“I think we’ve stirred us up a 
Donnybrook in the good old Pet- 
er Hawley tradition,” he said. 
“Let’s cut out and slope for 
home.”

'T'erry scrambled to his feet, 
pocketing the Peacekeeper’s 
stunner because it seemed like a 
good idea at the time. He looked 
around at the people of Coleban ; 
some were frozen, some were 
leaving and a fair number were 
converging warily. “Beau,” he re- 
plied, “I read you a solid five by 
five.” 

Side by side, the Terrestrial 
youth and his dog headed for the 
nearest door. The crowd melted 
before them, opening a way; 
those Who were the professionals 
in this game beat a parallel course 
outside of the immediate crowd 
and began to converge on the 
door. Slowly; they would bring 
up behind and surround the pair 
with the aid of those outside. 

A large figure loomed in the 
door, blocking it almost complete- 
ly- 

“Beau! It’s old saffron-face. 
Hit ’im high; I owe him one!” 

They hit old saffron-face one- 
and-two. Beauregarde caught the 
throat with the soft-trained 
mouth of a retriever, and the 
dog’s mass bent old saffron-face 
backward, thrusting the barrel 
stomach forward on an arched 
spine. Terry connected with this 
massive facade in a shoulder 
block that caught the plexus and 
the pit of the stomach with a par- 
alyzing blow. 

Saffron-face did not go down. 
He went back and back and back, 


off-balance on the rounds of his 
stumbling heels, his trained body 
struggling to regain footing. The 
mass of his flesh, which he’d used 
as a barrier at the doorway, be- 
came the main point of a one- 
body flying wedge that battered 
its way backward through his 
own men and created an avenue 
through which Terry and Beaure- 
garde went before the opening 
could close behind their human 
battering ram. At the curb, the 
stumbling heels found no means 
of support, and saffron-face went 
over on his back, walloping the 
back of his head on the pavement. 

He was out stone cold in the 
gutter when Terry and Beaure- 
garde used him as a gangplank 
toward freedom. 

iTVnce free of immediate hands, 
both of them turned left and 
ran along the center of the street. 
They outdistanced the local gath- 
ering with ease since the locals 
were still trying to figure out what 
had happened. By a zigzag course 
they managed to get themselves 
out of sight. 

“And now which way?” asked 
the dog. 

“The shortest and quickest,” 
said Terry immediately. 

“That may lead us through 
some trouble,” said Beauregarde, 
after looking around to locate 
himself with respect to the rest 
of City Coleban.

“That may be,” replied Terry, 
“but there’s two things wrong 
with trying to make it on the sly.” 
“Two?” 

“Two. First, I’ve suspected all 
along that this was a planned op- 
eration. Now I know it is. So the 
sooner we can get out of it the 
better — it’ll give us less time to 
get trapped. Two, the reason I 
know it is a planned operation 
is because I now know why they 
want me alive and with Under- 
standing. You see, Beau, I am a 
courier.” 

“A courier?” 

“Beau, I could hardly under- 
stand you before, even though 
you were speaking and thinking 
in my own native tongue. Now 
even this mess they gabble 
around here makes sense to me. 
I understand the tongue of Xan- 
abar. Now, how could you send 
a secret message through enemy 
territory in a universe where Un- 
derstanding is the way of life?” 
Beauregarde said, “I wouldn’t 
know. My world is not filled with 
intrigue and secret messages.” 
“Well, one of the first things 
about secret messages is to con- 
ceal the fact that a message is be- 
ing sent. In this universe of Un- 
derstanding, the only way is to 
send the message by some courier 
who does not yet have Under- 
standing — neither he nor anyone 
he meets will be aware of the 
fact. Second, of course, no one 


could simply carry a letter. To 
carry the information, I was given 
posthypnotic orders to forget 
what I’d been told until I was 
back home on Earth. Unfortu- 
nately, I gained Understanding 
while here in Xanabar. And if 
they get their clutches on me, 
they can extract the information 
because, with Understanding, I 
can call up information from my 
subconscious.” 

“And you know what this mes- 
sage is?” 

“Sure — and so does whoever 
runs the Peacekeepers of Xana- 
bar. So it’s no secret. Professor 
Marquart discovered the secret of 
Scholar’s Cluster and planted it 
in my mind to carry back home.” 
“Whoof!” said Beauregarde. 
He looked up into the sky. “My 
eyes are not as sharp as my nose, 
and I can neither see nor smell 
a hovercar at twenty thousand 
feet. Terry, do you see anything 
up there?” 

“Clouds. Oh, there’s a flash, a 
speck. Can’t make anything out.” 
“That will be an observer in 
a hovercar. Probably with a rifle- 
microphone that lets him listen 
to every word we say.” 

“So we cannot go by stealth,” 
said Terry. “Then we will go 
boldly and defy them to do their 
worst. Come on,” he said, “which 
way toward the spaceport?” 
Beauregarde pointed, then as 
Terry started walking in that di-

rection with, a determined stride, 
Beauregarde aligned himself at 
the lad’s side.

/^vnce more there came a change 
in the environment. A subtle 
change; not one of cracked win- 
dows, peeling paint, nor of lost 
elegance or a standard' of living. 
It was a change in the traffic, 
both vehicle and human. It was 
not a change in the pattern, but 
in the density; as if some com- 
puter had extrapolated the natu- 
ral city pattern of shaded ran- 
domness along an asymptote 
toward zero. It looked exactly 
like one of those periods in the 
life of any community in which, 
in certain hours, everyone in the 
area is busy inside. 

And being so natural-looking, 
it went unnoticed by Terry and 
Beauregarde. 

The total area was roughly el- 
liptical, with the major axis 
aligned with their general course. 
Being further geometric, Terry 
and Beauregarde were approxi- 
mately at one focal point of the 
ellipse, the behind point, so that 
the other focus was always ahead 
of them. As they walked toward 
the spaceport — still far across 
the city — the citizens of Xana- 
bar were being ordered aside and 
away, to clear the area; they re- 
mained aside and out of sight 


until the Terrestrial pair passed, 
and were then permitted to re- 
sume their daily lives. 

It was an operation that could 
only have been carried out with 
the resources of a large, despotic 
organization that was driven by 
the prospect of great gain or loss. 

From the site, the operation 
was not possible to grasp, but it 
was clearly visible to Martell and 
Homburg. 

These Xanabarians had aban- 
doned their offices and the huge 
illuminated map for cramped 
quarters in a huge tractor-trailer 
van, fitted inside as temporary 
field offices. In place of the city- 
wide map was a sectional area 
to the same approximate scale 
and detail, showing the neigh- 
borhood. Tiny colored pointlets 
of light labeled and identified all 
vehicular and pedestrian traffic 
so that citizen could be told from 
Peacekeeper, with Terry and 
Beauregarde especially coded. 

'T'hey were not alone, citizen, 
-*• Peacekeeper and the two tar- 
gets. Peter Hawley was present, 
too. Peter did not have the ad- 
vantage of the high-flying hover- 
oars, with their rifle microphones 
and the super televideo lenses, 
and the computer that maintain- 
ed surveillance over the neigh- 
borhood by following the moving 
traffic and maintaining the code 
once the object was identified. 


UNDERSTANDING 


171 


But Peter Hawley was not 
without his own sources of in- 
formation. Earth’s recognition of 
the silliness of trying to operate 
under cover in a universe full of 
Understanding had another fac- 
et. By using Beauregarde, an ob- 
ject as conspicuous as a paid poli- 
tical advertisement, Peter could 
keep track of Terry with fair 
accuracy. For the passage of any- 
thing as exotic as Terrestrial dog 
through any district made various 
waves. Some were frightened, 
some curious; many had heard 
of this strange beast with the 
tongue of man. Speculation, fear, 
wonder, sometimes amusement 
and quite frequently fanciful tales 
of personal encounter were com- 
monplace in the streets and in 
the vurguzz joints; all one had 
to do was listen carefully and 
then sort fact from fiction. 

By keeping one ear to the 
ground, Peter Hawley had been 
able to keep track of Terry and 
the dog, and so long as progress 
was maintained, Peter let well 
enough alone. 

Like Terry, Peter was at a to- 
tal loss to figure out what Xana- 
bar had in mind; certainly there 
was enough manpower to collect 
the kid if Xanabar wanted to and 
was willing to pay the price of 
overt kidnap. In the hope of gain- 
ing some idea of what was going 
on, Peter let things ride, while 
watching carefully. 


When the call went out to exe- 
cute one of their mobilization 
plans, its interception by the Ter- 
restrial Office was a matter of 
standard operating procedure. 
Peter went to the periphery of 
the ellipse along with Martell, 
Homburg and their specialized 
force of Peacekeepers. Knowing 
the city well, Peter stationed him- 
self fairly accurately on a near- 
line between Beauregarde’s posi- 
tion and the spaceport. This left 
an error-probability of several 
city blocks, but it was close. 

So in this area there were three 
very determined attitudes. One, a 
very large and determined group, 
was not going to let Terence Lin- 
coln get to City Coleban space- 
port; they were restrained only 
by the sure knowledge that open 
violence would bring about re- 
taliation and they were wary 
of the fratchy temper of all Ter- 
restrials. The second, a minor- 
ity consisting solely of Peter 
Hawley, was bent upon joining 
forces with Terry and Beaure- 
garde and marching out of the 
district with them, daring any 
Xanabarian to put one toe over 
the line demarking a forty-foot 
circle about them. The third con- 
sisted of Terry and Beauregarde, 
who wanted out and were going 
to get out, with or without help, 
with flags flying or furled, either 
marching down the avenue or 
slinking through the alleys.

GALAXY 


Tt was Terry, who noted the 
lightening traffic. Not as such, 
however, but in an entirely dif- 
ferent way. 

The sight of standard urban 
traffic is natural, as inconspicuous 
to the city man as Poe’s Pur- 
loined Letter or the postman 
whose presence was so stereo- 
typed and scheduled that he was 
above suspicion. But when traf- 
fic thins down, it is no longer 
the collective: City Traffic, but 
individuals and vehicles that are 
not a mass but a bunch of articles 
that neither look nor act alike. 

Put another way, Traffic is a 
moving mass; but a Vehicle is a 
means of transportation. 

“Beau,” said Terry. “Why must 
we walk?” 

“I don’t see any visible means 
of riding,” said the dog. “Why, 
there aren’t any cars parked 
along here. And if we did try to 
swipe one, could you drive it?” 

“Not really, and this is hardly 
the time to start learning, even 
though the principle must be 
about the same as any vehicle. 
You know, a dingus to start it, a 
doodad to make it go fast or 
slow, wheel or lever to steer and 
some sort of brakes. Finding out 
which is which can be hazardous 
if done empirically. No. Beaure- 
garde, I was wondering whether 
we might convince some driver 
that it would be the friendly 
thing to drive us.” 


“I see,” said the dog. “You 
mean, ‘To the spaceport, James, 
or kiss your arm good-by.’? ” 

“Something like that.” 

“Might be interesting, at that,” 
said Beauregarde, looking up and 
down the street carefully. “And 
now that you mention it, traffic is 
sure thin. Terry, I’ll bet you a 
nice juicy steakbone that any 
driver we stop will be Peace- 
keeper in mufti. This is the kind 
of caper they plan.” 

“Well, you’ve taken on a 
Peacekeeper or two, haven’t 
you?” 

“Sure thing. Peter and I have 
taken on quite a number. But 
never more than one or two at 
a time.” 

“Then one more won’t bother 
you.” 

“Not really — but this time 
we’ll be taking on the entire 
force, Terry.” 

“The entire force is what 
they’ve got surrounding us,” said 
Terry thoughtfully. “And we’re 
going to be collected at their op- 
tion — unless we bust out shout- 
ing.” 

“I hear you,” said Beaure- 
garde. “But what do you propose 
to do about it?” 

“We wait until we and a ve- 
hicle approach a traffic signal 
simultaneously; specifically, a ve- 
hicle with a single occupant, the 
driver. And one with doors easy 
to open.”

'T'hey continued toward the 
next intersection, paying lit- 
tle apparent attention to their 
surroundings, but watching care- 
fully in any windows to see if 
there was a vehicle approaching 
Far behind, one turned into the 
street and began to approach 
them. 

Terry chuckled. “Now I know 
why the old folks kept saying 
that they simply can’t explain 
Understanding to someone who 
doesn’t have it and didn’t have 
to to someone who has. It’s sort 
of &e playing chess with every 
move and motive explained.” 
Beauregarde said, “Peter al- 
ways claims that Understanding 
is a sort of refined premonition 
or intuition; that women and dogs 
always had it even before it was 
discovered.” 

“Beau, when was Understand- 
ing discovered?” 

“All interstellar travelling cul- 
tures have it,” said Beauregarde. 
“It seems to enter any culture 
that is on the verge of real space 
travel. I guess, about that time, 
most people in the culture are 
well warned and prepared to be- 
lieve that Out There they will 
meet creatures of extreme ugli- 
ness whose ancestors were out 
spacing while the home race was 
still settling their differences with 
a stone hatchet.” 

“I mean in the individual.” 
“Same difference but less vast. 


It comes rapidly once the indi- 
vidual really matures enough to 
take on true responsibility, face 
the consequences of his own acts, 
and above all, to take care of 
those Who depend upon him. 
Now, of course, there always have 
been individuals like that, many 
of them. But Understanding hag 
to wait until the culture is ready 
for it. Until then, it lies a dor- 
mant faculty that all passes to 
some degree, but — er, let’s put 
it this way, Terry: until the cul- 
ture and its people are advanced 
enough to grasp Understanding, it 
itself can only be latent. And — 
er, here comes our transportation, 
right on time and to your speci- 
fications. Ready?” 

“Sure thing.” 

“Let’s go and find out who 
can maneuver the faster.” 

IX 

T he car stopped and paused 
overlong. Terry opened a rear 
door, and Beauregarde leaped in, 
over the back of the front seat, 
and showed the driver his fangs. 
Terry got in behind and closed 
the door. 

“Peacekeeper,” said Beaure- 
garde, “this may be an act to 
you, but we’re deadly serious. 
Got it?” 

The driver hit the go pedal, 
and the car leaped forward; with- 
in five seconds it was going fifty 


174 


GALAXY 


miles per hour. “Bite me at this 
speed,” said the driver, “and none 
of us will walk home.” 

“You haven’t won yet,” snarled 
Beauregarde. “You’ll have to 
slow down sooner or later, and 
then you lose — unless you’re 
driving us toward the spaceport.” 
“Watch me,” said the driver. 
He goosed the pedal until the 
car was making better than sixty- 
five. Then he relaxed behind the 
wheel. 

Neither Terry nor Beauregarde 
had ever envisioned a situation 
like this, but both of them un- 
derstood what was going on. Ob- 
viously, the driver was following 
a carefully outlined route, from 
which all traffic had been cleared 
so that such breakneck speed was 
quite safe. It went quietly, there 
was no blare of the horn at in- 
tersections. And to point up the 
magnitude of the forces that Ter- 
ry and Beauregarde were facing, 
traffic signals always turned to 
favor the hurtling vehicle even 
though there was no side traffic 
visible at any intersection. 

“This always proves what Pet- 
er says,” said Beauregarde. “If 
you want to ride at a break-law 
speed, ride with a Keeper Of The 
Peace, who is sworn to defend 
and uphold the law. It’s fun go- 
ing this fast, isn’t it?” 

“So far. But when he stops?” 
“We’ll see. Surely,” said Beau- 
regarde to the driver, “you don’t 


think that stopping before fifty 
thousand witnesses is going to 
stop me from making a mess of 
you.” 

“Not really. It’s one of the 
hazards of the profession,” said 
the driver. 

With great skill, the driver hit 
a turn, tapped the brakes until 
the car drifted, waited through 
the drift until the car was aligned 
with the new street, and then 
kicked the drive again. The turn 
took no more than a second or 
two, and the force of the turn 
made them all hang tightly — 
too tightly to bother watching 
their surroundings. 

When stress and strain dimin- 
ished it was too late; dead ahead 
and blocking their path was a 
huge van. To Terry it was a sure 
crash, and coming too suddenly 
to do more than realize that a 
sure crash was coming. To Beau- 
regarde it was part of the caper 
but this time was far too short 
to do more than appreciate the 
fact. To the driver it was part 
of his instruction and training, for 
instead of hitting the brakes in 
a panic stop, he hit the go-pedal 
and clenched the wheel careful- 
ly. 

The back of the van dropped, 
making a ramp. The oar hit the 
ramp and raced up with hardly 
a bounce on its special springs. 
Inside the van was a solid mass 
of feathery plastic that cushioned 


UNDERSTANDING 


175 


the possible crash; a carefully 
designed mass of plastic that ap- 
plied braking force inversely pro- 
portional to the kinetic energy of 
the racing car. 

The car came to a stop with 
all three occupants pasted to the 
front by the force of decelera- 
tion, but unharmed beyond a few 
bruises and the inevitable black- 
out that comes with the high-G 
forces. 

'\X7'hen the smoke cleared 
* ’ away, Beauregarde was in 
a small cage, Terry was manacled 
lightly to a chair, and their driv- 
er was receiving the thanks of 
a man behind a small but orn- 
ate desk. 

Beauregarde said, “That was 
a fine operation — but then, it 
would be, wouldn’t it, Commis- 
sioner Martell?” 

“You know him?” asked Ter- 
ry- 

“Sure. Peter and I have met 
him a number of times but un- 
der different circumstances. This 
is Commissioner Martell, Num- 
ber Two Peacekeeper. The party 
sitting at the other desk is Hom- 
burg, Number Three or among 
the several Number Threes that 
Martell has reporting to him.” 
“Quite,” said Martell to the 
dog. To Terry he said, “You are 
Terence Lincoln, of Earth.” 

“I am — and now that you 
recognize me, I demand that you 


place me on a spacecraft bound 
for Earth.” 

“Stop acting childish,” said 
Martell coldly. “You’ve gained 
Understanding. You are responsi- 
ble for your acts. You are going 
to account for them.” 

“I am a Terrestrial — ” 

“You are a lawbreaker, and 
we are operating within the rules 
of Universal Law.” 

“If so, why this big opera- 
tion?” 

“Quite simple,” said Martell 
calmly. “At first, we assumed 
that your runaway was only a 
boyish lark, the universal urge to 
go it alone in a strange land for 
a time. We tolerated your boyish 
pranks. We smiled at your theft 
of food, for it is neither the policy 
of Xanabar nor the desire of her 
citizens that the stranger within 
her gates go hungry.” 

“That was darned nice of you,” 
said Terry. 

“Then you team up with this 
animal, and at that point you 
became no longer a youth with 
an adventuresome spirit, but the 
center of possible danger to the 
Peace of Xanabar. At this point, 
the Peacekeepers we assigned to 
see that you came to no harm in 
the badlands of City Coleban 
were then assigned to protect the 
Peace. And then you gained Un- 
derstanding, Terence Lincoln, and 
became responsible for your 
acts.”

“So I did. But there’s an — ” 
“And, with Understanding, did 
you abandon your lawlessness? 
You did not. Instead, you assault- 
ed a Peacekeeper — ” 

“Old saffron-face had it com- 
ing.” 

“ — during the performance 
of his duty instead of appealing 
to him for protection and safe de- 
livery to the spaceport. Had you 
renounced your former acts by 
becoming a peace-loving man, 
you would not be here.” 

“Nuts,” replied Terry. “I know 
why I’m here and so does Beau- 
regarde.” 

“Of course,” said Martell 
smoothly. “Understanding works 
that way. You are a lawbreaker, 
and you are here to account for 
your petty felonies.” 

“Fine. And I suppose that I 
will be sentenced to a series of 
terms for vagrancy, theft, trespass 
and using old saffron-face for a 
punching bag? Terms long 
enough to squeeze the secret of 
Scholar’s Cluster out of me.” 

£ 4\/ou have that secret?” asked 
a Martell. 

“Get off it,” growled Terry. 
“You know it, and I know it, and 
Beauregarde knows it. Maybe 
even Peter Hawley knows it by 
now.” 

“Yes,” smiled Martell suavely. 
“But you see, I know it now be- 
cause you’ve told me.” 


“Terry,” said Beauregarde, 
“you can’t fight this city hall- 
itician with words. You’ll find 
that he and his gang of Peace- 
keepers were acting only in the 
best interests of Xanabar, and 
for both Earth and its hapless 
youth, Terence Lincoln. That he 
and his have put you through a 
wringer, and out of it comes a 
hidden secret — that’s just seren- 
dipity, Terry.” 

“Well,” replied Terry thought- 
fully, “nothing we’ve done is a 
capital crime, so he’ll have to re- 
lease us sooner or later.” 

“I’d prefer it sooner,” said 
Beauregarde. “This cage isn’t big 
enough, and I’m not in favor of 
cages anyway. Peter — ” 

“You can forget Peter Haw- 
ley,” said Martell. “The danger 
of you and the youth together 
was so great that we have cleared 
the entire district of anybody ex- 
cept we Peacekeepers, who have 
sworn to lay down our lives to 
maintain the Peace of Xanabar.” 
“And I suppose that stunt with 
the truck full of crushable gunch 
was simply part of the Peace- 
keeping activity?” 

“How would you apprehend a 
headstrong youth and a danger- 
ous animal who had just invaded 
the car of a citizen and threaten- 
ed the citizen with the loss of life 
or limb? Would you hold up a 
hand and cry ‘Stop!’ or per-

“Forget it,” said Beauregarde. 
“You make me — ” 

f I 'here came a crash. The van 
lurched, humping high on 
one corner and then dropping 
down so that the corner was low- 
er than the others. The sense of 
smooth motion stopped. 

There was muffled shouting 
outside. The van lurched slowly 
again. Then came that incredibly 
short electrical tingle that fills 
the region when a nerve stunner 
is fired; the effect came through 
the metal walls of the van even 
though the bolt would not have 
penetrated. 

The uproar outside ceased. The 
van door opened, an dtwo Peace- 
keepers came in carrying a man 
by ankles and armpits. The man 
was not as stiff as a board, be- 
cause the old cliche implies some- 
thing straight and flat. The man 
was stiff all right, but he had 
been frozen in the typical posture 
of a man halfway through the act 
of getting out of a car in a tear- 
ing hurry. The Peacekeepers 
dropped him on the floor, where 
he rolled over statuelike until 
three points of rest came to 
ground with the center of gravity 
between them. 

“He came roaring down the 
street flat out,” explained one 
Peacekeeper. “He didn’t try to 
miss you. Instead, he aimed the 
car like a missile.” 


Martell nodded and waved the 
Peacekeeper away. “Now we are 
complete,” he said cheerfully. 
“Terence Lincoln, may I present 
Peter Hawley — who won’t be 
able to do anything for a day or 
so. Now,” he said to the dog, 
“what were you thinking about 
Peter Hawley?” 

“There isn’t much to say,” said 
Beauregarde. “You’ve got me 
caged, Terry manacled to that 
chair and Peter Hawley in the 
deep freeze. We can’t even go 
where you’d like us to go — we’ll 
have to be taken.” 

Martell turned to Homburg. 
“Whistle up your car. There’ll be 
room in it for all of us, if we put 
Hawley and his dog in the trunk.” 
He turned to Beauregarde. “And 
that makes three,” he said, wav- 
ing a hand at Peter. “Lawbreak- 
ers all; for we will find that his 
stated purpose was to come here 
to assist you criminals to escape. 
He is an accessory and thus ac- 
cused of the same breaches of the 
Peace as you.” 

Beauregarde made an ugly 
dog-noise deep in his chest. Terry 
rattled the handcuffs helplessly. 
Peter Hawley startled everybody 
by emitting a long, lung-shudder- 
ing sigh and collapsing from his 
up-ended statue position to a 
completely flaccid limpless flat 
upon the slightly tilted floor. 

“They must have hit him with 
a near-miss or a splash-off from 


178 


GALAXY 


the car body,” said Martell. “He 
shouldn’t go limp for at least an- 
other hour.” 

“No matter, Martell,” said 
Homburg. “It will make him eas- 
ier to put in my trunk.” 

“So it will, Homburg. So it 
will.” 

Inwardly, Homburg glowed. 
Martell had been addressed as an 
equal and had replied in kind. 
He had been accepted. 

For one of five in the office 
van, things were looking up. 

X 

r TT'he man who entered wore the 
uniform of a Peacekeeper, 
complete with side-arm, but on 
his shoulder was the blazer of a 
chauffeur. He saluted Homburg 
and said, “Your car, Zer Hom- 
burg.” 

“You made good time,” nod- 
ded Homburg. “Get help and put 
that one in the trunk. Then come 
and get that animal and put it 
with its master. In the trunk. We 
will be quite capable of handling 
the youth.” 

“Yes, Zer Homburg.” 

The chauffeur turned to walk 
toward Peter Hawley as Hom- 
burg approached Terry Lincoln. 
It was their first mistake. 

Terry waited, looking helpless 
as Homburg approached, the ring 
of keys dangling from his hand. 
“Behave,” he said to the youth, 


“and you won’t get hurt.” Seeing 
no move or even an air of defi- 
ance, Homburg put the key in the 
lock, turned, and sprang the cuff. 
Terry lurched backward in his 
chair, curled like a ball, put his 
feet up and let them fly outward. 
Homburg went hurtling back, the 
ring of keys completely tom 
from his grasp. He hit the dog’s 
cage at the same time Terry’s 
chair completed its backward 
overturn and hit the floor. 

The blow took Terry’s breath, 
but he was young and he had 
been hit before on the playing 
fields of Scholar’s Cluster. He 
landed almost flat and rolled to 
one side, the keys still dangling 
from the lock. 

Homburg’s scream stopped all 
motion. He’d fallen with one arm 
close to the dog’s cage. While 
Homburg’s body was still a-tuffi- 
ble, Beauregarde had snapped at 
the fingers and caught. Now he 
had hand and arm through the 
bars; he had Homburg’s wrist be- 
tween the gleaming molars, with 
the fangs denting the skin on the 
far side of the wrist. As the echo- 
ing scream died, the dog applied 
pressure. Homburg screamed 
again. 

Terry got to his * feet slowly, 
watching the action — or the 
frozen lack of it — warily. “Beau- 
regarde means ‘stop!’ or your 
man Homburg loses a hand,” he 
said.

They stood. Martell in half-a- 
step forward; the Peacekeeper 
half-turned from Peter Hawley, 
his hand on the side-arm; Hom- 
burg on the floor, groveling in 
fear and pain; and Beauregarde 
with a trickle of blood on his 
muzzle. 

They stood frozen for but a 
moment, but it was moment 
enough for Terry to regain his 
breath and his balance. Then as 
he reached to unlock the other 
cuff, Martell went into sound and 
fury. 

* 4 i f 'yrill them both!” he shouted 
at the Peacekeeper and 
with the words he leaped for Ter- 
ry. Terry swung the manacles; 
they were not the morgenstem 
of knightly warfare, but they were 
lethal against uniarmored flesh. 
The open cuff caught Martell in 
the mouth and stopped him in 
midstep. 

Behind the Peacekeeper, Peter 
Hawley fought himself to his 
knees, lunged with painful lack 
of nearly all coordination, and 
managed to connect — not with 
the Peacekeeper’s shooting arm, 
but with his calves and ankles. 
The shock wrecked the Peace- 
keeper’s aim; the bolt hit the 
metal wall and simply disappear- 
ed. Its field tingle went un- 
noticed. 

Beauregarde snapped his head, 
and Homburg screamed once 


more and fainted. “Get me outa 
here!” roared the dog. Terry 
swung the manacles again, but 
Martell ducked back — and into 
the Peacekeeper, who was trying 
once more to take aim. They both 
went back a step, off balance; 
then the second step hit the still- 
trying Peter Hawley. Peacekeep- 
er and Martell went down a- 
sprawl, landing on Peter, who 
did not feel a thing. 

There were, by luck, only two 
keys on the dangling ring that 
still hung from the cuff. One was 
the key still in its lock. The other 
was the only one free. Without 
even looking, Terry lunged with 
the other key, slid it into the lock 
on the cage and turned. Beaure- 
garde came out with a leap that 
brought him face to face with 
Martell — or more properly, fang 
to face with Martell. With a snarl, 
Beauregarde said, “I broke his 
wrist. What do you want to lose, 
Peacekeeper?” 

Martell cringed back from the 
fangs, but replied, “You wouldn’t 
dare — ” 

“Oh, I can bite gently,” said 
the dog. 

“You cannot win. We’re sur- 
rounded by my men for an entire 
district of City Coleban.” 

“Then I suggest that you tell 
them that you are escorting Ter- 
ence Lincoln to the spaceport, in 
person, with Beauregarde the dog 
and Peter Hawley the Terrestrial 


180 


GALAXY 


Agent as part of the embarking 
party.” 

Martell sneered. “Watch,” he 
said. He stepped to the door of 
the van, ran down the window 
and shouted orders that the Ter- 
restrials were to be given free 
passage. 

Qeconds later there was a muf- 
^ fled blast outside, and a black 
missile screeched in through the 
opened window and hit the far 
wall. Beauregarde leaped and 
caught it in mid-bounce, snapped 
his head aside without waiting 
to come to the floor and whipped 
the smoking missile through the 
opened window. It burst outside; 
some of the pale blue gas bil- 
lowed in, but not enough to do its 
job. A second missile hit the side 
of the van. A third hit the win- 
dow, cracking it, as Terry wound 
it up. A fourth hit the closed 
window but did not shatter tire 
glass. 

Calmly, Martell said, “I don’t 
mind taking a gas nap. You can’t 
stay in here forever, and when 
we awaken, we Peacekeepers will 
be once more the masters.” 

There was an official sounding 
rap on the door. “Open!” came 
the cry. 

“Go ahead, Terry, open it.” 

“And let them in?” 

“No, to let me out for a mo- 
ment.” 

“I — er — ” 


“Open it, Terry,” said the pain- 
ful voice of Peter Hawley. “He 
— knows what — he’s doing.” 
Terry opened the door. Beaure- 
garde leaped out, catching the 
Peacekeeper outside by the throat 
and carrying him backwards by 
yards before the two of them 
went down. The man screamed 
in fear and pain, and Beauregarde 
cold-bloodedly raked the soft 
throat to make ugly furrows that 
ran together and down to a 
spreading red puddle on the 
pavement. Then with a leap the 
dog turned, made three long 
bounds and on the third passed 
back inside the van. 

Terry slammed the door behind 
the dog; he was just in time to 
stop a spattering of missiles that 
further cracked the glass but did 
not breach it. 

B eauregarde faced Martell; 

there was menace in the dog’s 
forward pose and there was ainger 
in the dog’s voice. 

“You, Martell, listen to me. 
We’re safe in this bullet-proof, 
mobile castle of yours, but you’re 
likely to win so long as you can 
keep us bottled up. But we’re not 
staying. Peter is here — ” 

“I’m not much — like my 
fighting — self,” groaned Peter 
Hawley. 

“In fighting trim or barely able 
to sit up and take nourishment, 
you’re good for this game.” 


UNDERSTANDING 


181 


“Game? Oh, the one about the 
farmer with the fox, the goose 
and the sack of grain, and one 
wide river to cross in a leaky 
boat?” 

“The same — with Terry as 
the prize. Now, Martell, hear this! 
I am a dog, and while I have 
Understanding, it is a dog’s Un- 
derstanding because, being a dog, 
I think like a dog. No civilized 
person commits murder, Martell. 
But isn’t ‘murder’ confined to the 
killing of one’s own species? I 
hardly think of it as ‘murder’ 
when Peter Hawley points at 
some ugly bastovich and says, 
‘Beauregarde, kill!’ because the 
deceased isn’t my kind of herring. 

“Now,” went on the dog, “that 
Peacekeeper out there on the 
street isn’t dead, but he will bear 
the soars of dog-fangs for life and 
he will forevermore be scared of 
the sight of Terrestrial dog. You, 
Martell, think of him as an ex- 
ample and tell your mob of 
Peacekeeping warriors outside to 
think of their Glorious Leader, 
Commissioner Martell, lying out 
there for real with his throat 
slashed with sharp teeth' — be- 
cause that is the name of the 


game of the farmer with the fox 
and the goose and the grain.” 
“Threats cannot — ” 

“Get off it!” snapped the dog. 
“They can too. You will therefore 
give orders that Homburg’s tame 
Peacekeeper is to drive through 
your battle line with Terrence 
Lincoln and your outfit remains 
honest. Once Terence is in the 
hands of the local Terrestrial Of- 
fice at the spaceport, your Peace- 
keeper and Peter will return, at 
which point I will permit your 
man Homburg to depart as whole 
as he ever will be. It shouldn’t 
be too bad,” said Beauregarde 
with a cynical tone in his voice, 
“because a man in his position 
hardly needs a good, flexible, 
fast-drawing gun wrist. Once 
Homburg gets to a sawbones for 
his shattered wrist, and Peter 
gets a shot of perk-up to dissipate 
that nerve-stun hangover, he him- 
self can return alone and we hap- 
py trio will walk out of here with 
you in the middle.” 

“You fools, you cannot — ” 
“But you forget. It’s really 
your throat that we are wagering, 
isn’t it — Bod Martell?”

TAamon Knight perpetrates the 
damnedest jokes on himself. 
Behold him : author, critic, doyen 
of the good, holy and true in 
science fiction, and editor of 
Worlds to Come (Harper and 
Row, $4.95). This is a collection 
of nine science-fiction adven- 
tures. The contributing authors 
are, in the order of the table of 
contents, Arthur C. Clarke, H. B. 
Fyfe, Ray Bradbury, Algis Bud- 
rys, Isaac Asimov, John D. Mac- 
Donald, Robert A. Heinlein, C. 
M. Kornbluth and James Blish. 

This title is more than amply 
justified by Damon’s introduc- 
tion, which is an excellent essay 
on science fiction as prophecy. 
He begins: “Science fiction and 
prophecy are two different 
things.” Exactly so. In his post- 
war eagerness to propagate sci- 
ence fiction through the general 
audience, John W. Campbell had 
fallen into the trap of claiming 


that only prophetic science fiction 
was science fiction at all. Fortu- 
nately, he asserted, there was a 
lot of it. And its literary merit 
was directly measurable in terms 
of its content of successful pro- 
phecy. In other words, when Hol- 
land invented the submarine, he 
transformed Jules Verne from a 
flaneur into a great writer. 

Damon says, much more cor- 
rectly, that today’s generation of 
scientists contains a number of 
influential individuals who, as 
impressionable youngsters, were 
influenced by science fiction. And 
the science fiction of their ado- 
lescent days in turn embodied a 
great many subconscious desires 
of the people who grew up to be 
today’s taxpayers. Thus, science 
fiction is in a sense a vehicle for 
self-fulfilling prophecy, since to- 
day’s science is shaped by some 
ex-fans pursuing the research 
programs which the taxpayers 


188 


will underwrite, as distinguished 
from the programs no one will 
give a plugged nickel for. 

This oversimplifies the case, 
and certainly paraphrases the 
hell out of it, but it approximates 
the truth. This is essentially what 
Damon says, and this is approxi- 
mately the real situation in 
(those few areas of) science 
(which I have observed closely). 

That being so, we are now 
pressed for some means of under- 
standing this book’s inclusion of 
Bradbury’s “Mars Is Heaven!”, 
John D. MacDonald’s “The Big 
Contest!” or “The Edge of the 
Sea”, by Algis Budrys, or, for 
that matter — a matter to which 
we shall return shortly — Arthur 
C. Clarke’s “The Sentinel”. That 
is, if these are supposed to be ex- 
amples of anything implied by 
the title of this anthology, or of 
any sequitur to Damon’s essay. 

There is no quarrel with the 
inclusion of H. B. Fyfe’s “Moon- 
walk”, or Robert Heinlein’s “Or- 
deal In Space”, Kombluth’s 
“That Share of Glory”, Blish’s 
“Sunken Universe” or Asimov’s 
“The Martian Way”. These stor- 
ies all say that man not only en- 
dures, lie strives meaningfully, 
(Italics mine). If they do not 
prophesy in the Campbellian 
sense, they are not supposed to. 
And it may be that they will in- 
spire, and that someone reading 
them here now — which seems 


unlikely, considering how often 
most of them have been reprinted 
before — will in turn be moved 
to go forth in actual grapple with 
the actual trucuiences of the ac- 
tual universe. 

But the burden of “Mars Is 
Heaven!” boils down to man’s 
old fear that nothing works, that 
neither God nor intelligence can 
save you, and that there is a bur- 
glar under the bed. There is no 
fulfillment here. Beautifully writ- 
ten, poetically effective, excellent- 
ly designed, this story simply 
evokes the empty stuff of night- 
mares. Damon even says so. 

“The Big Contest” is just an- 
other gimmick story, again evolv- 
ed out of the childhood dream 
that there are superintendents 
under every sidewalk. The bur- 
den of “The Edge of the Sea” is 
that brawn and pride will take 
you places. At no time does the 
story suggest that you will have 
the foggiest notion of where 
you’re going, or that you will be 
capable of accomplishing any- 
thing in particular once you get 
there. 

I’m therefore not at all sure 
why these stories are in this book, 
since, with only nine entrants on 
the table of contents, Damon 
should not logically have had any 
time to waste in proving his 
point. 

I feel particularly the same 
way about “The Sentinel.” Ar-

thur C. Clarke, educated and in- 
telligent, is supposed to be one 
of the big guns in “hard” science 
fiction. Author of some of my 
favorite science-fiction novelettes 
though he is, he is in fact the 
author of a clutch of mystical 
novels and only one or two 
“hard” ones, and has a fixed and 
pernicious idea of how to produce 
a saleable short story. 

That idea is to introduce an 
intriguing technological notion or 
scientific premise, and then use 
it to evoke frights and menaces. 

It is true, indeed, that one can 
raise a formidable reputation for 
profundity by repeating, over 
and over again, that the universe 
is wide and man is very small. I 
think we would do well to re- 
member, perhaps a bit more of- 
ten, that while our instruments 
show that the universe is wide, 
they are our instruments and we 
managed somehow to build them. 
There is no evidence Whatsoever 
that Man is that goddamned 
small. 

In fact, this kind of story is 
infuriating in that it lends a great 
deal of ostensibly objective valid- 
ity to what remains purely a 
matter of opinion. Precisely the 
sort of opinion which ought to be 
punched in the nose. However, 
perhaps Damon is slyly trying to 
demonstrate for us that this is 
the reaction whereby science-fic- 
tion readers are motivated to go 


out and bop Man’s way to the 
rulership of the Sevagram. Or, 
in other words, Jules Verne in- 
spired the submarine, and if he 
had been even more wrong-head- 
ed, he would have done it sooner. 

/^nce again Fritz Leiber’s The 
Big Time has been mistaken 
for a novel, this time by Ace. At 
the seventeenth World Science 
Fiction Convention, it received 
the Hugo for the best science- 
fiction novel of the year. It cer- 
tainly is the best extended-struc- 
ture literary work to have crossed 
my desk (in any direction) in a 
very long time, and I have no 
doubt that it deserves any num- 
ber of awards. But it is a play. 

This is perhaps a little difficult 
to tell because it’s written in the 
first person. But the reader gains 
nothing from this intimacy with 
the supposed narrator that he 
could not learn by simply watch- 
ing and listening. What he would 
observe would be the events on 
one set — a sporting house/hos- 
pital operated by the Spiders in 
their time war with the Snakes. 

There is definite breaking into 
acts, and the chapters are in fact 
scenes. The dialogue used by the 
articulate, desperate, gestureful, 
small cast is stage dialogue. 
There is nothing in this story that 
could not be played under an 
arch, in the round or, for that 
matter, on a high wire.

What the entrances, perform- 
ances and exits of this little most- 
ly human troupe accomplish is a 
statement about all wars, and all 
people. The device of a time war 
between two insuperable and in- 
human forces far removed from 
these, their agents, becomes even 
more effective in emphasizing 
this universality, for the charac- 
ters can and do depersonalize 
themselves as they destroy reali- 
ty. 

In years to come, then, when 
“they” are looking for a good 
play with a science-fictional ba- 
sis, “they” — presumably, this 
same kind of people who found 
dramatic material in transcripts 
of the Nuremberg trials and in 
the clinical descriptions of the 
Marquis de Sade — need look 
no further. 

I most urgently recommend 
this book to you. It’s a beauty, 
for one thing. For another, it 
leads one to think that Fritz Lei- 
ber was the only science-fiction 
writer of any consequence — be- 
fore the most recent generation, 
that is — who as a matter of 
course and conviction saw 
through the mores and circum- 
scriptions which are now proving 
nonviable not only in commercial 
literature but in what we can call 
life as well. Since the new peo- 
ple — Zelazny, Delany et al. — 
are pretty unquestionably the 
wave of the future, and since the 


winners write the history books, 
if any of these new people have 
any gratitude or brains at all, 
Fritz Leiber is going to turn out 
to have been the most important 
science-fiction writer of the last 
thirty years. 

np/ie Past Through Tomorrow 
■*- is billed, (by Putnam at 
$5.95), as Robert A. Heinlein’s 
future history stories. That it is 

— I guess. I’m sure it’s one of 
the most logical things for a pub- 
lisher of science fiction to have 
done; a magnificient compendi- 
um, coincidentally a rewarding , 
and perhaps accurate cross-sec- 
tion of a writer’s career. This is 

a book from which there is no es- 
cape; if you have a science-fiction 
library then you have got to have 
this book in it, because it con- 
tains (nearly) all the wordage 
ever written to fit into Heinlein’g 
chart of the future. 

The “future history” as I’n$ 
sure you know, is the framework 

— written down ahead of time, 
in most instances — into which 
many stories signed Robert A. 
Heinlein were fitted. (Those 
which did not fit were often sign- 
ed Anson MacDonald.) Heinlein, 
even when the idea of charting 
the assumptive future was novel 
as an auctorial device, had trou- 
ble keeping his imagination in 
bounds. Just so, when he first 
drew up his chart, and published 


GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


191 


it, had several titles and stories 
in it which do indeed 'have to be 
there logically, but which for one 
reason or another (“The Stone 
Pillow”) were never written. 

The potential problem has 
been solved here without any 
awkwardness. The titles of the 
unwritten stories have been drop- 
ped from the chart. 

Consequently, this volume is 
somehow not as dramatic and im- 
pressive as its idea was back in 
the days when you could shake 
up science-fiction readers just by 
telling them you had an intellec- 
tual system, and really rock them 
back on their heels by giving 
them even the slightest clue that 
you were aware of a larger world 
beyond either the medium or its 
message. 

Be that as it may, this is really 
a book to have — some of the 
finest writing this field has ever 
known. It simply isn’t quite the 
book one would have predicted. 

V"ou may believe all you please 
-*• (if you do so believe) that 
there is no qualitative difference 
between the talented science-fic- 
tion writers of today and the 
talented science-fiction writers of 
any previous generation since the 
invention of commercial science 
fiction. But there is such a differ- 
ence. Roger Zelazny, J. G. Bal- 
lard, Brian Aldiss and Samuel R. 
Delany, the variously tall giants 


of our new day, are altogther 
different, in all significant re- 
spects save that of talent, from 
every talented science-fiction 
writer who had come along since 
Hugo Gernsback’s time. They 
are different because they are in 
living contact with the things that 
are so upsetting to the modern 
middle class. This is a stunning 
reversal of the habitual situation. 

I don’t know any plainer way 
to spell out what I feel when I 
read the words of these people. 
They are of an earthshaking new 
kind. Not that I’m not aware of 
differences between them. Aldiss, 
for instance, seems the least tal- 
ented of them. J. G. Ballard 
seems the least intelligent. 

I am aware they did not spring 
full-armed from the Earth’s 
brow. There are echoes in those 
new creatures of Philip K. Dick, 
Walter Miller, Jr. and, by all 
odds, Fritz Leiber. Their styles 
will trick you, sometimes, into 
thinking of Sturgeon and Brad- 
bury — but that’s simply a trib- 
ute to their acumen in choosing 
weapons. 

(It does not matter that some 
of these things I am aware of 
may have no existence in objec- 
tive truth, and it doesn’t matter 
how any of them feel about each 
other, much less whether they 
agree with me even to the extent 
of permitting themselves to be 
grouped under this walnut shell.

Artists usually get shoved into 
whatever corner is most conven- 
ient to the organizers of art.) 

What a book like Samuel R. 
Delany’s The Einstein Intersec- 
tion (Ace) demonstrates, garish 
cover, tasteless packaging, ridicu- 
lous blurbs and all, is that the 
wave of the future has broken 
over us. 

Delany at present has about as 
little discipline in his writing as 
any writer who has tried his hand 
at this field. Even Harlan Ellison 
— a suddenly remote ancestor — 
is no less organized. In this story 
of, I guess, a various young man’s 
search for apotheosis in the pecu- 
liar world of the emerging new 
people who have borrowed some 
from us — occupy our space, and 
intersect our heritage but are ap- 
parently free to pick what they 
want of it, and leave what they 
don’t want, except it doesn’t 
work out that way — Delany 
does half a dozen impossible 
things before breakfast, and then 
forgets to eat. 

It doesn’t really matter, how- 
ever. The eyes through which De- 
lany sees, or the tongue with 
which Zelazny speaks, the ear 
with which Aldiss listens, and the 
snake-dry touch of Ballard’s fin- 
gertips, are the organs of com- 
prehensible senses which happen 
to be connected to incomprehen- 
sible — but very lucid — brains. 
It would not only be dreadful if 


they suddenly began writing for 
the 1944 Astounding, it would be 
impossible. 

The point is, if you are still 
reading everything from the 
viewpoint of the 1944 Astound- 
ing, in a few years you will find 
that these people — whether you 
approve of them or not — have 
picked up the field, carried it 
elsewhere and left you with noth- 
ing but a complete collection of 
yellowed, crumble-edged bewil- 
derment. 

Where, before now, was there 
a pulp science -fiction writer who 
wrote a book “primarily during 
a year of travel in France, Italy, 
Greece, Turkey and England” 
who had not steadfastly taken 
Main Street right along with 
him? Beside Delany’s or Zelaz- 
ny’s cosmopolitan grasp, all the 
shoutings and rebellious hurrah- 
ings of even our most articulate 
iconoclasts are reduced to baby 
tantrums. Delany isn’t even an- 
gry at some of the things which, 
by previous definition, should 
crush or infuriate him. Delany is 
deeply moved by things which 
few of us have ever even suspect- 
ed of being tragic. 

The man simply operates on a 
plane which Robert Heinlein 
never dreamed of, nor John W. 
Campbell Jr., nor — take a deep 
breath — Ted Sturgeon, Ray 
Bradbury or anyone else we could 
have put forward as being a poet

a mere five or six years ago. 

Not that I’m saying these new 
writers are good simply because 
they speak in riddles or babble 
in tongues. We have already 
spent many years worshipping 
the half-articulate and the half- 
comprehensibly poetic. No, the 
point is that When Delany de- 
scribes to us what he has seen, 
what he can compute, adduce, 
intuit or smell in the underbrush, 
our reaction is to sit bolt upright 
and cry out, “Of course! I have 
that very wound myself!” 

The ability to produce this re- 
action in people is one of the 
commonly accepted and appar- 
ently valid appurtenances of gen- 
ius. And this field has never be- 
fore had a single solitary one of 
them, let alone several. 

Having said all this, and hav- 


ing urgently recommended iT.he 
Einstein Intersection to you, I 
want to go on record here as say- 
ing that when you finish reading 
it you may be rather angry at 
me for steering you to a book 
whose structure and purpose on 
its own terms are not realized. 

As far as I’m concerned at this 
point, all that means is that De- 
lany hasn’t quite gotten himself 
under control. But when I think 
of all the perfectly controlled, 
thoroughly dead, bad books that 
I and all of us have read under 
the impression that we were ex- 
periencing something enjoyable, 
and when I look forward to the 
explosions that reading this will 
create within you, I frankly don’t 
care very much whether this is a 
perfect book or not.

M* when you join the Science Fiction 

Book Club ond agree to accept only 
four books during the coming year 

T ins brilliantly exciting chronicle of the world of the future 
combines three great science fiction classics for the first 
time in one huge volume. FOUNDATION . FOUNDATION 
and EMPIRE . and SECOND FOUNDATION are among

from the pen of the distinguished research biochemist and 
leading science fiction writer, Isaac Asimov.

Because you enjoy Science thrillers, the Science Fiction 
Book Club would like to acquaint you with the most imagina- 
tive, informative, entertaining new science fiction books as 
they are written. That is why we have arranged to send you 
THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY for only 10c with a Trial 
Subscription to the Club. 

Here's how the Club works: each month it offers a really 
superb new science fact or fiction book at a fraction of its 
regular price. Even though these books sell for §2.50, §3.00, 
§4.05 and up in their original editions, Club members get them 
— FOR §1.40 EACH (plus shipping and handling) — in special 
full-length, hard-cover editions. Extra-value books cost more. 
And the Club tells you in advance what each monthly selection 
will be. During your Trial Subscription you agree to take as 
few as four books in the next twelve months. After that you 
may take as few or as many books as you want, and you may 
cancel at any time. It's a deal that is hard to beat. 


Mail Coupon With Only 1 0f 

THE FOUNDATION TRILOGY costs new members only 
10 with a short trial membership. After ten days, if you 
are NOT delighted, return the book and your membership 
will be canceled. Otherwise you will be enrolled in the Club 
as a Trial Member, and you need take only four books in the 
next twelve months. Mail the coupon today to: Science Fiction 
Book Club, Garden City, New York 11530.

nl ready begun to 
war among themselves, plunging the universe 
into barbaric chaos. Civilization seemed doomed. 

But master scientists laboring to ensure that 
civilization would be preserved during the dark 
ages to come, established twin "Foundations” at 
opposite ends of the Galaxy, to form the nucleus 
of a new civilization, and in time to unite across 
the Galaxy to form a new ... a stronger ... a 
more enduring Second Empire. 

In Foundation and Foundation and Empire, 
we follow the course of the First Foundation as 
it rekindles the light of civilization in an ever- 
increasing portion of the Galaxy — and as it is 
confronted by its greatest crisis: a dangerous 
mutant, an evil net brilliant psychopath whose 
soul-consuming dcirire is conquest of the Galaxy! 

Within a decade, he tyrannized the entire 
Galaxy — except for the Second Foundation. 
And this became his mania — to find and conquer 
the Second Foundation. Everything in the 
Galaxy must be his! .
