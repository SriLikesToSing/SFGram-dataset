The Election Everybody Won 



■IT^e’re pleased to announce ffie 
^ ^ winners of tKe 1968 Galaxy 
Award (see tKe announcement 
elsewhere in this issue), and we 
particularly want to t&anir ifie 
hundreds of subscribers of Galaxy 
and If who did the voting. 

You might be interested in tfie 
procedure. Om’ plan from the be- 
ginning was to have the choices 
made by the readers themselves, 
and to the maximum extent pos- 
sible by all readers, rather than 
any particular group. Since we 
could, not reach every reader of 
If and Galaxy, we limits the vot- 
ing to subscribers, partly because 
their names were readily avail- 
able ■ to us, and partly because 
they would be in a good position 
to choose among aU the eligible 
stories, since they would have in 
nearly all cases read them all. 
So we selected samples of sub- 
scribers at random (the number 
of persons chosen was relatively 



small — but by standard statis- 
tical criteria, enough for good re- 
liability), and mailed them bal- 
lots. 

One list of every story publish- 
ed in If in 1968 went to If sub- 
scribers; a similar list of Galaxy 
stories went to Galaxy subscrib- 
ers. We asked them to indicate 
their favorites, totaled the votes 
and selected the top 10 from both 
magazines. A list of these 10 went 
to a fiuiher random sample of 
people who were subscribers to 
both Galaxy and If, and their 
votes picked the winners, 

I t was an interesting experience, 
and, we think, a worthwhile 
one. Certainly we now have an 
even better idea of what you like 
than we had before. We’ll be do- 
ing it again next year! Meanwhile 
— to the winners, our congratula- 
tions to the voters, our thanks.

For years beyond counting they

imprisonment on Earth — and now 
the day had come to live again 1 

PROLOGUE soaring in tfie eternal twiligfit of 

her yellow skies, casting long 
T Tere in the darkness and tHe shadows across the lawn and 
silence I dream of Ysar. In pool and the tiled avenues where 
the mirror of my mind I see long ago victorious armies rode 
again her towers and minarets in processional tmder bright ban-

ners. Amber light glows on flower- 
ing trees and the carved facades 
of jeweled palaces. Once more in 
memory I hear the music of horns 
heralding the approach of tri- 
umphant princes.' 

I recall the voices and faces 
of men and women, of warriors 
and queens, of tradesmen and 
viceroys, of metalworkers and 
courtesans, of those who Have 
lived and walked these streets, 
rested beside these pools and 
fountains, under the ocHre light 
of the forever setting sun of Ysar. 
And I see the scarred unconquer- 
able ships, proud remnants of a 
once great fleet, true to their an- 
cient pledge, mounting on col- 
„ umns of fire, setting course out- 
ward to face the enemy once 
again. 

Here in the darkness and the si- 
lence, I wait, and dream of Ysar 
the well-beloved; and I vow that 
I will return to her, though it be 
at the end of time. 

I 

A man sat at a small desk be- 
side an open window, writ- 
ing with an old-fashioned steel 
nib pen which He dipped at in- 
tervals into a pot of blue-black 
ink. A soft sea-wind moved the 
curtain, bringing an odor of salt 
and kelp. Far away, a bell chimed 
out the hour of six P.M. 

The man wrote a line, crossed 
8 



it out, sat looking across the 
view of lawns and gardens. His 
face was strong-featured, square- 
jawed. His gray hair lay close to 
a finely formed skull. His fin- 
gers were thick, square -tipped; 
powerful fingers. 

“Writing poems again, Mr. 
Grayle?” a voice spoke suddenly 
from the doorway behind the 
man. He turned with a faint 
smile. 

“That’s right, Ted.” His voice 
was deep, soft, with a faint trace 
of accent. 

“You like to write poems, don’t 
you, Mr. Grayle?” Ted grinned 
in mild conspiracy. 

“Um-hum.” 

“Hey, game time, Mr. Grayle. 
Guess you maybe didn’t hear 
the bell.” 

“I guess not, Ted.” Grayle rose. 

“Boy oh boy, the Blues are 
going to mop up on the Reds 
tonight, hey, Mr. Grayle?” Ted 
stood aside as Grayle stepped 
out into the wide, well-lit corri- 
dor. 

“Sure we will, Ted.” 

They walked along the passage, 
where other men were emerging 
from rooms. 

“Well, tonight’s the night, eh, 
Mr. Grayle?” Ted asked. 

“Tonight?” Grayle inquired 
wildly. 

“You know. The new power 
system goes on. Just pick it out 
of the air. Nifty, HuH?” 



GALAXY 



“I really didn’t know that.” 
“You don’t read the papers 
much, do you, Mr. Grayle.” 

“Not much, Ted.” 

“Boy oH boy.” Ted waggled Kis 
Head. “WHat will they come up 
with next?” 

They crossed an airy court, 
passed through an arcade and 
emerged onto a wide, grassy 
meadow. Men dressed in simple 
well-made, one-piece garments, 
some bearing a red armband, 
others a blue, stood in groups 
talking, tossing a baseball back 
and forth. 

“Go get ’em, Mr. Grayle,” Ted 
said. “Show ’em the old stuff.” 
“That’s right, Ted.” 

The man called Ted leaned 
against a column, arms folded, 
watched as Grayle walked across 
to join his team. 

“Hey, that’s the guy, KaH?” 
a voice spoke beside Ted. He 
turned and gave an up-and-down 
frown to the young fellow wHo 
had come up beside him. 

“What guy?” 

“The mystery man. I been 
hearing about him. Nobody knows 
how long he’s been Here. I Heard 
he killed a guy with an axe. He 
doesn’t look so much to me.” 
“Mr. Grayle is an all-right guy, 
greenhorn,” Ted said. “That’s a 
lot of jetwash about nobody 
knows how long he’s been here. 
They got records. They know, 
okay.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



Ballantine 

Books 

the peculiarities of writing 

I news of current books for any 
magazine is the time difference. 
Thus in the depth of winter, hem- 
med in by sheet ice and under 
attack by the Asiatic hog cholera 
and a faulty stove, one finds one- 
self writing of books that will be 
available in the spring, a dream 
world months away. Still, there 
are compensations. 

For instance, this spring comes 
more easily than most because of 
the joy of publishing Anne Mc- 
Caffrey. An original novel, to boot. 
Original meaning never before 
published in any way, shape, or 
form. It's not often one can say that 
these days since most of this lad/s 
work is published in magazine form 
just as rapidly as she can produce 
it. 

Anyway, the book is titled DECISION 
AT DOONA, and it's 75c. Anyone who 
likes cats will love this one — anyone 
liking people will wonder. Aside from 
Miss McCaffrey, worshippers of E. R. Ed- 
dison (and you're either an enthusiast or 
you're damn well not) will be delighted by 

I our original (here meaning "first American 
publication") of the MEZENTIAN GATE. 
In print, of course, we hove THE WORM, 
FISH DINNER and MISTRESS OF 
MISTRESSES (oil reprints of hardcover edi- 
tions). THE GATE completes the group al- 
though not In chronological order. Each of 
the volumes is 95c 

Thirdly we have our own reissue of what 
was originally our own original, Edmund 
Cooper's DEADLY IMAGE, as prophetic a 
novel as you're likely to find. First pub- 
lished in 1958. Now 75c. 

There are other forms of originals — like 
a collection of short stories which have 
been done in magazines but never publish- 
ed together as a book, or expanded ver- 

9 




One of 



sions of novelettes, or, or, or. There^s no 
real need to be knowledgeable about 
publisher definitions of original but it's a 
point of interest to people over thirty who 
remember the days when everything was 
original. And 25c. No wonder everybody 
starved to death. The odd and happy 
thing is that now that prices hove im- 
proved, many more (and better) books 
are being written and published than in 
the bad old days. Here's a partial listing

tally, as intelligent s.f. fans, you shouldn't

that new boy they've got in the Deport- 
ment of the interior. Support conservation 
any way you can, otherwise ali we'll have

“How long you been fiere,i 
Ted?” 

“Me? Five years, wfiy?” 

“I talked to Stengle; fie’s been 
Here nineteen years. He says tSe 
guy was Here tiien.” 

“So?” 

“He looks old enougfi to be 
an old con.” 

“WKafs fie supposed to look, 
old? So lie’s maybe tfiirty-five, 
maybe forty-five. So wHat?” 
“I’m curious, is all.” 

“Hah’,” Ted said. “You college- 
trained guys. You got too many 
tfieories. 

Tfie young fellow sfirugged. Tfie 
two guards stood watching as 
tfie teams formed up for tfie 
nightly ball game played by tfie 
inmates of the Caine Island Fed- 
eral Penitentiary. 

I t was a long, narrow room, dim, 
age-grimed, smelling of the 
spilled beers of generations. 
Weak late afternoon sunshine fil- 
tered through the bleary plate- 
glass window where garish blue 
glow letters spelled out FAN- 
GIO’S in reverse. A man with 
four chins and a bald skull bulk- 
ed behind the bar, talking to a 
small, quick-eyed man wKo 
hunched on a stool next to a de- 
funct jukebox, loaded with curl- 
ed records five years out of date. 
In tfie comer booth, a man vdtH 
a badly scarred face sat talking 
to fiimself. He was dressed in an 

GALAXY 



expensive gray suit wfiicfi was 
dusty and stained. A gold watcH 
gleamed on one wrist, visible un- 
der a black-edged cuff as Ke ges- 
ticulated. 

Tfie bum is dougH-Eeavy,” tfie 
small man said, watching the 
lone drinker in the tarnished mir- 
ror through a gap in the clutter 
of blended whiskey bottles on the 
backbar. “Did you eyeball that 
bundle?” 

Fangio’s eyes moved left, right, 
left as he scraped slops into a 
chipped plate. 

“Seen Soup around?” he mur- 
mured. 

The small man’s eyelids flick- 
ered an affirmative. 

Fangio laid the plate aside and 
wiped his hands on the place.” 
He walked away, eased sideways 
through a narrow door. The small 
man went to the phone booth' 
at the end of the bar and punch- 
ed keys; he talked, watching the 
scarred man. 

A woman came in through the 
black glass doors. She was mid- 
dle-aged, a trifle plump, heavily 
made up. She took a stool at 
the bar, looked around and call- 
ed, “Okay, snap it up. The lady’s 
waiting.” 

The small man kicked open 
the door of the booth. 

“Beat it, Wilma,” he said in a 
low voice. “Fangio ain’t in.” 

“What’re you, the night watch- 
man?” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Go on, dust.” 

“I’ll get my own.” She starfed 
around behind the bar. The small 
man jumped to Her, caught her 
bracelet-heavy arm, twisted sav- 
agely. She yelped and kicked at 
him. 

The doors banged as a squat 
man in a shapeless gray coverall 
came in. He stopped dead, look- 
ing at the two. He had a wide, 
dark face, bristly black hair; 
acne scars pitted his jaw and 
hairline. 

“What the — ” he started. 

“Yeah, Soup,” the small man 
said. “I was calling ya.” He step- 
ped clear of the woman, who 
snorted and yanked at her dress. 
The small man tipped his head, 
indicating the occupied booth'. 

Soup gave Wilma a deadly 
look. “Beat it,” he said. She 
scuttled behind him and out the 
door. 

In the booth, the scarred man 
was opening his fist. 

“ . golden bird of Ahuriel,” 
he said. “Once flown, never to be 
recaptured ...” 

“What’s he talking about?” 
Soup asked. 

The small man shook His head. 
“He’s scrambled.” They walked 
back, stopped beside the table. 
The scarred man ignored them. 

“Try the left hip.” 

Qoup reached out with a prac- 
ticed motion took the drunk’s 

11 



arm up behind him, forcing his 
face down onto the table. A glass 
fell over. Soup reached across be- 
hind the seated man, patted his 
back pocket, brought out a sheaf 
of currency, folded once across 
the middle. The bill on the out- 
side was a fifty. Holding the 
owner’s arm, he spread the bills. 

“Hey,” he said. “New shoes for 
baby.” 

He released the seated man’s 
arm and stepped back. The vic- 
tim sprawled, unmoving, with his 
cheek against the table. 

They had taken two steps when 
the scarred man came up out of 
the booth in a lunge, locked his 
arm across the squat man’s throat 
and bent him backward. 

“Stay, hagseed!” he hissed. His 
face was mottled, blurred, con- 
torted. “Art his emissaries? Lurks 
he yonder?” 

The small man made a grab for 
the money still in his partner’s 
hand, missed, turned and ran 
for the door. 

“Find thy tongue, wretch, ere 
my dirk rips thy weasand.” 

Soup’s hand, clutching the 
money, waved near the scarred 
man’s face; he plucked the bills 
away, as with a desperate plunge 
the squat man broke free. 

“Stay whelp. I’ll have report 
o’ thy master!” the scarred man 
snarled, making a grab at the 
man. He missed, staggered 
against a booth. The squat man 
12 



disappeard via the rear door. 
The scarred man looked at the 
money in . his hand as though 
noticing it for the first time. 

“Nay . ’twere but a mere 
cutpurse,” he muttered. “Naught 
more.” He looked around as 
the door opened cautiously. The 
woman called Wilma looked in, 
came through. 

“Hey,” she said. “What gives?” 

The scarred man blinked at 
her, weaving. 

“Fetch ale, wench,” he mut- 
tered and turned, half fell into 
the nearest seat. 

The rear door burst open; Fan- 
gio appeared, goggling. 

“Hey, what — ” 

“Draw two,” the woman bark- 
ed. She sat down across from the 
scarred man, who was leaning 
back, eyes shut, mouth open. She 
stared curiously at his disfig- 
urements. 

“You know him?” Fangio ask- 
ed tersely. 

“Sure. Him and me are old 
pals.” She transferred her gaze 
to the money in the drunken 
man’s hand. 

“Varfor?” the scarred man 
mumbled. “Varfor har du gjort 
det du some var min van och 
bror?” 

“Why does he talk funny?” 
Fangio was frowning darkly. 

“He’s some kind of a Dane,” 
the woman said quickly. “My 
first husband was a Dane. I heard 

GALAXY 



plenty of that kind of jabber.” 

“He looks like some kind of 
Jew,” Fangia said. 

“Get the beers,” the woman 
said. “You aint no Jew, are you, 
honey?” She patted the big- 
knuckled hand that lay on the 
table. 

“Geez, will you look at them 
scars?” Fangio said. 

“Used to be a fighter,” the 
woman said. “What is this a quiz 
show?” 

“ ’Twere but a dream,” the 
scarred man said suddenly. He 
opened his eyes, looked vaguely 
at the woman. 

“Just . dream,” he said. 
“That’s all. Bad dream. Forget 
it.” 

The woman patted his hand 
again. “Sure, honey. Forget it. 
Wilma will take care of you. 
Wilma’s got a room, honey. We 
better get you there while you 
can still navigate.” 

A t the Upper Pasmaquoddie 
Generating Station (Experi- 
mental), a dozen Senators and 
Representatives, the State Gov- 
ernor, assorted lesser political 
lights, and a selected cadre of re- 
porters were grouped around the 
Secretary of the Interior as he 
stood chatting with the Chief, En- 
gineer and his top aides before 
the forty-foot-wide, twelve-foot- 
high panel clustered thick with 
instrument dials and aflash with 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



reassuring amber, red, and green 
lights indicating that all was in 
readiness for the first commercial 
transmission of beamed power in 
the history of the Republic. 

“It’s impressive, Mr. Hunni- 
cut,” the Secretary said, nodding. 
“A great achievement.” 

“If it works,” a saintly-look- 
ing Senator said sharply. 

“The technical people assure 
us that it will, Cy,” the Secre- 
tary said tolerantly. 

“I’m familiar with the inverse 
square law,” the Senator retort- 
ed. “You go pouring power out 
into the air, not one per cent of 
it will get where’s it’s supposed to 
go. It’s a boondoggle! A waste of 
the taxpayer’s money.” 

The Chief Engineer frowned 
as the reporters jotted briskly. 

“Senator, I don’t think you 
quite understand. We aren’t 
broadcasting power, as you call 
it — not directly. We erect a 
carrier field — somewhat similar 
to the transmission of a Three- 
V broadcast. When the field im- 
pinges on a demand point — an 
energy- consuming device, that is, 
the type responsive to the signal 
— there’s a return impulse — 
an echo — ” 

“The Senator knows all that, 
Mr. Hunnicut,” the Secretary said, 
smiling indulgently. “He’s speak- 
ing for publication.” 

A man in an oil-spotted 
sfhock came up, showed the 

13 



Chief Engineer a clipboard. He 
nodded, looked at the clock. 

“Two minutes to zero hour,” 
tfie Secretary said. “Everything 
is still proceeding normally?” 
“Yes, sir, Mr. Secretary,” the 
technician said, thep retreated 
under the blank look this netted 
him from the dignitary. 

“All systems are functioning,” 
Hrmnicut said, making it offi- 
cial. “I see no reason that we 
shouldn’t switch over on sched- 
ule.” 

“Think of it, gentlemen,” the 
Secretary turned to the legisla- 
tors, and, incidentally to the re- 
porters. “Raw power, tom 
from the heart of the atom, har- 
nessed here, waiting the call that 
will send it pouring into the 
homes and factories of Amer- 
ica — ” 

“At this point, we’re only pow- 
ering government-operated fa- 
cilities and public utilities sys- 
tems.” Hunnicut interjected. “It’s 
still a pilot operation.” 

“ . freeing man from his age- 
old drudgery, ushering in a new 
era of self-realization and bound- 
less promise — ” 

“Sixty seconds,” a voice spoke 
sharply from a ceiling grill. “Au- 
tomatic hold.” 

“Proceed,” Hunnicut said. 

In silence, the men stood 
watching as the second hand of 
the big clock 'scythed away the 
final minutes of an era.

T he scarred man lay on his 
back on the narrow bed, 
sleeping with his mouth open. His 
face, in the slack repose of' pro- 
found drunkenness, was a rav- 
aged field where battles Had been 
fought and lost, long ago. 

The woman called Wilma 
stood beside the bed, watching 
him by the glow of a shadeless 
table lamp. She tensed as the 
light faltered, dimmed; shadows 
closed in on the shabby room; 
then the lamp winked back to 
full brightness. The woman let 
out the breath she had been hold- 
ing, her momentary panic dissi- 
pating. 

“Sure, it said on the tube about 
switching over onto the new ra- 
dio power tonight,” she murmur- 
ed half-aloud. On the bed, the 
scarred man stiffened; he grim- 
aced, moving his head from side 
to side. He groaned, sighed, grew 
still again. 

Wilma leaned over him; her 
hands moved deftly, searching 
out his pockets. They were emp- 
ty, but she found the roll of bills 
wadded under the folded blanket 
that served as pillow. As she with- 
drew it, she glanced at his face. 
His eyes were wide open, locked 
on hers. 

“I ... I was just fixing your 
pillers,” she said. 

He sat up with an abruptness 
that sent her stumbling away, 
clutching the money in her hand.

‘.‘I . was going to take care 
of it for you.” Even in her own 
ears. Her voice sounded as false 
as brass jewelry. 

He looked away, sKaking His 
Head vaguely. Instantly, her bold- 
ness returned. 

“Go on, go back to sleep, sleep 
it off,” sKe said. 

He ^ew aside tfie mottled 
blanket 'and came to His feet in 
a single motion. The woman made 
a sEow of recoiling from his nak- 
edness. 

“Lookit Here, you!” she said. 
“I didn’t come up here to — ” 

He went past her to the enam- 
eled sink hanging crookedly on 
the wall, sluiced his face with 
cold water, filled his mouth and 
spat, stared at himself in the 
discolored mirror. He picked up 
tHe smeared jeUy glass from its 
clotted niche, but it shattered in 
his hand. He stared narrow-eyed 
at the cut on his palm, at the 
black-red droplets forming there. 
He made a strange sound deep in 
his throat, whirled to look around 
the room as if he had never seen 
it before. 

“Xix,” he said. “Where are 
you?” 

Wilma made a move for the 
door, recoiled as he approached 
her, he reached out, witii a pre- 
cise motion plucked the money 
from her Hand. He peeled off a 
ten dollar bill, thrust it at Her. 

“You’d better go,” he said. 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Yeah,” she said. Something id 
his voice frightened Ect. ‘*Sure* 
I was just looking in.” 

After she had gone. He stood 
in the near-darkness. His Head 
cocked as if listening to distant 
voices. He opened his cut hand« 
studied it. The wound was an 
almost invisible line. He brushed 
the congealed droplets away im- 
patiently. 

His clotlies lay across the foot 
of the bed. He began to dress 
himself with swift, sure fingers. 

Tn the prison dining Hall, the 
A guard Ted sat looking wor- 
riedly across the wide, softly lit 
room at the small comer table 
where, by long custom, Grayle 
dined alone. He had glanced that 
way a few moments after the 
lights had momentarily dimmed 
down, on an impulse to' share the 
moment with the prisoner, grin- 
ning a satisfied grin that said, 
“see, we did it.” But Grayle Had 
been slumped back, gripping the 
chair arms, his usually impassive 
features set in a tight-mouthed 
grimace. This had given way to a- 
look of utter bafflement. Now 
Grayle sat rigid, looking fixedly 
at nothing. 

Ted rose and hurried across. 
Close, he saw the sweat beaded 
on the prisoner’s face. 

“Mr. Grayle — you okay?” 

Grayle raised his Head slowly. 

“You sick, Mr. Gtayle?” Ted 

,15 



persisted. “SHould I call ttie 
doc?” 

Grayle nodded curtly. “Yes,” 
fie said in a ragged voice. “Get 
fiim.” 

Ted fumbled for tfie communi- 
cator clipped to fiis belt. Grayle 
put out a band. “No,” fie said 
sfiarply. “Don’t' call. Go get Kim, 
Ted.” 

“Yeafi, but — ” 

“Go and fetcfi film, Ted. Quiet- 
er tfiat way,” fie added. “You 
understand.” 

“Ufi, yeafi, okay, Mr. Grayle.” 
Ted fiurried away. 

Grayle waited for a full min- 
ute; tfien fie rose, lifted tfie table, 
spilling disfies to tfie floor. Witfi 
a bellow tfiat rang in tfie peace- 



ful room like a lion’s roar, fie

G iant trees stand in blue shad- 
ow against the wide sweep 
of the virgin snowfield. A heat- 
less sun hangs almost unmoving 
in the ice-blue sky. A fitful wind 
drives plumes of ice crystals 
across the slope. 

A man moves slowly across the 
white slope. He is tall, deep-chest- 
ed, . massive-shouldered, dressed 
in a form-fitting suit of a glossy 
blue-black material ornamented

by bright bits of metal and enam- 
el. There are raw burn scars on 
the right side of his jaw and 
neck, and his dark red hair is 
singed at the temple. He staggers 
as he walks, making his way dog- 
gedly ddwnslope. 

He reaches the center of the 
snow-covered meadow, where a 
swift stream flows under a thin 
skim of ice. Kneeling, he drinks, 
swallows a pellet from a pouch 
at his waist before he goes on. 
At dusk he reaches the sea. 

It is wide, blue-black, laced 
with the white foam of breakers, 
the rocky shore slopes steeply 
down to the watery edge. The 
wind blows an odor of iodine and 
salt spray into bis face. When he 




wades out, the cold numbs Be

Small creatures dart in the shal- 
lows. In a tidal pool among the 
rocks, a fish flops in water too

life squirming against his fingers 
as he carries it back down fo die 
sea. 

Darkness falls. The man makes 
camp by trampling a hollow in 
the snow in the lee of a craggy 
boulder. He lies looking up at 
a sky strangely improverished of 
stars. A glow grows in the east; 
a vivid orange disk appears, 
brightening to a pure white as 
it rises above the tree-tops. It is 
a dead world, fantastically cra-

The surf murmurs; the wina

stealthy ctunchings . 

He sits uptight, and by the 
blight light of the full moon sees 
a ^ant beatded figute tobed in

tHe sunset across tHe scarlet wa-

“Beautiful evening,” Crassman 
said. We’re making time. I told 
you we were smart to make tHe

“Daddy, wfiafs tiiat?” Elaine 
was pointing off tfie port bow at 
a curiously r^ular-sKaped cloud

formation: a great purple and 
pink wedge, its apex toucHing tfie 
Horizon, its top merging witH tfie 
soft evening Haze. 

“NotHing,” Crassman said easi- 
ly. “Just clouds.” 

“Cfiarles, I don’t Uke tfie look 
of tfiat,” Mrs. Crassman said 
sfiarply. “It looks like one of 
tfiose, wHat do tfiey call tHem,

Crassman laugHed. “Tfiat’s out

He said, and took a sip of fiis 
drink. But fiis eyes lingered on 
tfie cloud. 

“Go around it.” 

Crassman Had been Half-un- 
consciously easing tfie bow to

words He swung tfie compass 
pointer squarely back to 220®. 
“Just let me do tfie navigating,

“It’s so big,” Elaine said. “And

“Just an optical illusion.” 
Crasman’s eyes were on tfie com-

“I Have my Hands full r unnin g

“Daddy — is anytHing wrong?” 
“I don’t know!” 

“Tfie cloud — it’s mowng! It’s

“It’s not moving — we’re drift-

of crazy cross-ciurent ninning — ” 
“CHarles — please! I want to

“Don’t be ridiculous!” Grass- 
man continued to figfit tfie cur- 
rent; tfie big cloud, deep purple 
now and dead afiead, looked om- 
inously close. It rose, spreading 
like an inverted mountain ifl tfie 
sky. Crassman watcHed it drift 
across His bow, begin to slide off 
in a curve to starboard. 

“It’s coming closer! We’ll run 
rigfit into it!” 

“Daddy, can’t you steer away 
from it?” 

“Well — I Hate to waste time 
being nervous about a mere cloud 
formation,” Crassman said, but 
He was quick to swing off to tiSe 
south, away from tfie cloud. Now 
tfie bow tended to swing to star-

Mrs. Crassman gave a muffled 
sfiriek. Crassman started, looked 
back at Her; she was pointing 
astern. Crasman’s Heart took a 
painful plimge in fiis cfiest. 

THe cloud was dead astern, 
and clearly closer tfian it had 
been five minutes earlier. 

“It’s gaining on us!” 

Crassman put tfie tfirottle all 
tfie way over. Tfie big engines 
opened up to a deep-cHested 
tfirum of power; tfie bow rose; 
spray wfiipped back across the 
big, sloping windshield. Crass- 
man looked back. Tfie cloud 
clung grimly astern. Off tfie star- 
board bow, tfie setting sun was a 
red ball on tfie fiorizon, slowly 
drifting across tfie boat’s bow. 
Now it was dead afiead; now 
drifting off to port, sliding back 
past tfie boat. A vast shadow lay 
over tfie water off tfie port bow, 
coming closer. It swept over tfie 
boat. Looldng back into tfie sud-

cloud, now dull purpli^-black, 
dense as granite, fialf-filling tfie

tfie engines, another sound was 
audible;: a vast, bass rumble, like 
Niagara multiplied. 

“Good God in Heaven,” Elaine 
said suddenly as tfie boat emerg-

T he meteorologist on duty in 
the United States Weather 
Satellite in Clarke orbit twenty- 
two thousand miles above the At- 
lantic had watched the anoma- 
lous formation for Half an Hour 
on _the big twelve-power screen 
before calling it to the attention 
of his supervisor, 

“Something kind of funny 
down there, Fred, just east of the 
sunset Kne,” he said, pointing out 
the tiny, blurred disk hugging the 
sea to the west of Somerset Is- 
land in the Bermudas. “It formed 
up in a matter of a minute or 
two, smack in the middle of a 
twelve-hundred-mile-wide high 
that was clear as window glass. 
And it’s growing steadily.” 

“An explosion, maybe?” the 
section chief suggested. 

“That thing’s over three miles 
wide already, Fred. It would take 
a nuclear blast to produce a 
smudge like that. Anyway, if it 
was a test shot, we’d have been 
notified.” 

“Maybe a nuclear ship blew her 
reactors. It’s never happened be- 
fore, but there’s always a first 
time.” 

20 



“The rate of dissipation’s 
wrong for an explosion. It’s not 
spreading fast enough’. And I 
think it’s rotating.” 

“Well, keep an eye on it. Bun- 
ny. Maybe you’ve nail^ the first 
hurricane of the season.” 

“If so, I’ve got a lot of meteor- 
ology to unlearn. Check witH 
Kennedy, will you, Fred? Some- 
thing about that spot worries 
me.” 

\ quarter of an hour later, Fre^ 
was back in the observer”s 
bubble. 

“Kennedy says no report of 
any detonation in the area. The 
autostations along the Atlantic 
seaboard are registering faW 
air -mass movements north and 
east. It’s a little early to tell i^ 
there’s any correction.” 

“Why doesn’t it dissipate?”' 
Bunny asked. “What’s holding 
it?” 

“Hard to say. Better put the 
recorders on it. Bunny. But don’t 
worry; old Mother Nature is. al- 
ways springing surprises on us, 
just when we think we know it 
aU.” 

Back in the communication 
center of the giant satellite, Fred 
flipped the key activating the 
beam linking the the station to 
Kennedy Weather Control. 

“Jake, no panic, but how about 
requesting an eyeball report on 
that fix I was talking to you 
. GALAXY 



about? Tlie damned thing’s still 
sitting out there like a tack in 
a board; and in the few minutes 
I was away, it grew visibly.” 
“Roger. I’ll scramble one of 
the old Neptunes out of Jax. 
Those reserve boys like to joy- 
ride anyway.” 

“Keep me posted, Jake.” 

“Sure, Fred. Anything for our 
brave lads in the sky.” 

T welve miles north of the vil- 
lage of Skime, Minnesota, 
Ame Burko, a seasonal trapper, 
threw down the armload of fallen, 
branches he had gathered for 
his fire and seated himself on a 
log for a quiet smoke before 
dinner. It was still evening, the 
sky tawny with the late summer 
dusk. Burko lit up, stretching his 
legs, thinking of the forty-horse 
outboard on display at Winberg’s 
in Skime. Everything a man 
wanted cost so much, seemed like. 
A car, now. With a car, he could 
get into town more often, see 
more of Barby . 

He pushed away the thought 
of her warm body and smiling 
face. No point in getting all up- 
set. He stood, paced up and 
down sniffing the air. Off to the 
east, through the trees, the ground 
rose toward the rocky outcrop- 
ping known locally as Vargot 
Hill. He hadn’t been up there for 
years, not since he was a kid. 
Used to pick berries there. Sup- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



posed to be haunted, the hill was. 
Kids used to dare each other to 
go up to the top. They’d creep 
up on it through the trees, get- 
ting quieter the closer they got. 

There were big rock slabs up 
there, sort of stacked, as if they 
had been piled up there by a gi- 
ant. The kids had had lots of 
stories about the Hill. About the 
dwarves and elves that lived 
down in the rocks and would 
come out and eat a careless kid 
who stayed too long after sun- 
set. And about the devil who 
took the form of a black panther 
and ranged around the coxmtry- 
side, looking for souls. 

Burko snorted a laugh and got 
busy with the fire. When it was 
going good, he stacked some 
stone around it and put on the 
fry ing pan. He unrolled the 
greased-paper-wrapped bacon, put 
half a dozen strips on. There 
would be a little smoke with the 
green fire, but he didn’t care. 
Walking all day made a man 
hungry. 

Funny about the black cat leg- 
end. Old man Olsen said the 
name Vargot was a corruption of 
an old word that meant “black 
cat.” Probably went back to some 
Indian legend. The SHoshonu had 
been big story tellers. Big liars. 
Swedes were pretty good liars 
too, when it came to embroider- 
ing a tale. He’d made up his 
share. That one time, after He’d 

21 



spent tHe best part of an after- 
noon up there playing on the 
rocks at the top of the hill, he’d 
been a sKort-term celebrity 
axnong the boys after Ke told 
them about the rock that had 
started to lift up while He was 
sitting on it, and How He’d Had 
to weight down all He could to 
Hold it in place. That one Had 
held tfiem witH tHeir moutKs open 
until Fats Linder Had said, “Nuts, 
Burko, nobody can weight down 
any Harder than wHat they are!” 
He turned the bacon, cut a 
couple of slices of bread. He soak- 
ed up the fat with the bread, 
forked the bacon onto it, then 
put the coffee jug on. He ate 
slowly, savoring every bite. It 
was almost full dark when he 
finished. A full moon was rising, 
glowing big and yellow in the 
east behind the hUl. He banked 
the fire, stretched, then on im- 
pulse started up the slope, along 
a faint game trail, grinning a lit- 
tle at himself as he felt a ghostly 
touch of the old superstitious ap- 
prehension. 

TTe made His way up through 
the dense blackberry bram- 
bles, not yet in fruit, emerged on- 
to the nearly level stretch, just 
below the, giant’s castle. He had 
never really noticed it before, but 
the place Had a sort of look, if 
you saw it in the right light, as 
if somebody had piled those rocks 
22 



up there. Just nonsense, of course, 
the glaciers had dumped rocks 
all across this country but these 
recks were all of a side, pretty 
near — and they Had a kind of 
quarried look about them. And 
the way they were arranged, sort 
of in a big rectangle, as far as 
you could tell for the growth , . 

Burko froze, looking up at the 
looming pile. Had something 
moved up there, something that 
flowed from shadow to shadoty 
. something that moved fast 
and smooth as a cat? , 

He was aware of his thudding 
pulse, of the tightness of his scalpv 

“Hell,” he laughed a^oud. “I’m 
as bad as a kid. The thing’s prob- 
ably an Indian mound. Full of 
busted pots and arrowheads and 
maybe some skulls. Dead Indi- 
ans. What the hell.” He went 
forward with a bold stride, climb- 
ed up the slanting slabs, step- 
ped up onto the flat stone that 
topped the structure. He was 
breathing hard, sweating lightly. 
A deer fly found him, buzzed his 
face sharply. He ■ slapped' at it. 
It was completely silent then. 
Burko took a step across the 
stone and halted. He stood that 
way for a full ten seconds, feeling 
his insides turn to water. 

Unmistakably, through the 
stone he felt a faint vibration. 
Below his feet something ancient 
and evil was stirring. 

Ame Burko was over three 
GALAXY 



miles from Vargot Hill when he 
stopped running. He Had sprain- 
ed an ankle jumping down the 
rock slabs, but fiad failed to no- 
tice it at tiSe time. 

A week later, ISs IBroat was 
still sore from the yell Ge Gad ut- 
tered as Ge fled. 

I n the office of tGe Governor, 
Caine Island General Peni- 
tentiary, tHe prison psydSologist 
leaned forward, across tGe desk, 
raising ffis voice over tGe sErill 
of the rising wind that buffeted 
outside the big, oak-paneled 
room. 

1 “I think you’re making a mis- 
take, sir,” He said. The man has a 
record of violence. He’s danger- 
ously unstable.” 

“Unstable, or unclassifiable, 
doctor?” The prison governor cut 
in. 

“I admit the man’s an enigma,” 
the psychologist said. “I don’t 
pretend to understand his moti- 
vations. But after this outburst, 
anything could happen.” 

The governor turned to stare out 
the high windows behind his desk. 
The low sky, clear an hour be- 
fore, now shed a light the color 
of dishwater across frond-strewn 
grounds, reflected from the white 
capped, hammered-pewter sea 
beyond. Through the massive 
leather chair and the deep pile 
carpet the minute trembling of 
the steel and concrete building 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



was plainly detectable. As the 
governor watched, a forty-foot 
royal palm, curved into an arc 
like a strung bow, snapped, fell 
across the massed bougainvillea 
that lined the south drainage ca- 
nal. 

“No one was hurt. I under- 
stand,” tfie governor said. 

“No, but Governor, you should 
have seen what he did to those 
chairs. Steel tubing, mind you. 
He twisted them into chrome- 
plated pretzels! Talk about mani- 
acal strength — ” 

“Where was his guard?” 

“He played sick, sent him for; 
the duty physician.” 

“Got him safely out of the way, 
in other words.” 

“Governor, aren’t you find- 
ing excuses for this man?” 
“There was a reason for the 
outburst, as you put it, Claude,” 
the governor said. “I want to 
know what that reason was.” 
“Governor, this is an old COii, 
a man who once took an axe tO 
a human being. In this day and 
age, an axe, for God’s sake! TG? 
savagery of it.” 

“Thank you for your opiniotf, 
Doctor; your warning is a mat- 
ter of record, in the event he tears 
my head off with his bare hands.” 
“I wasn’t thinking solely of my 
reputation. Governor.” 

“Of course not, Claude. Never- 
theless, I’m going to talk to him.” 
The governor nodded to the uni- 

23 



formed man posted beside the 
armored door. The guard touched 
a wall plate there was the safe 
double click-click! as the inter- 
locks disengaged. The door slid 
back; the guard took up his po- 
sition, choke gun in hand.'watch’- 
ing as Grayle came past him into 
■>the room. 

The tailored prison uniform ac- 
cented his powerful physique. As 
the prisoner advanced across the 
roof, the words “caged tiger” pop- 
ped into the governor’s mind. 

“That’s all, doctor,” he said. 
“Guard, wait outside.” 

“Now, just a minute,” the psy- 
chologist started. He caught the 
look his superior directed at him 
and left silently. The sliding door 
snicked shut behind the guard. 

CCTTello, Grayle,” the governor 
said. 

“Hello, Hardman,” the prison- 
er said in a tone of absolute neu- 
trality. 

The governor motioned to the 
chair beside the standing man. 
“Sit down,” he said. Grayle didn’t 
move. 

“Why?” the governor said. 
“Just tell me why, that’s all.” 

Grayle’s head shook almost im- 
perceptibly. 

You knew I was working on a 
special parole for you. I’d have 
gotten it, too. So you picked this 
time to break up the dining hall. 
Why, Grayle?”

“You were wrong about me. 
Governor,” Grayle said without 
expression. 

“Nonsense. If you started 
smashing chairs, you had a rea- 
son.” 

Grayle said nothing. 

“What are you tr5ung to 
prove?” the governor said KarsK- 
ly. “That you’re stUl a tough 
guy?” 

“That’s it,” Grayle said. 

The governor shook his Head. 
“You’re no brainless hoodlum. 
You had a reason — a good rea- 
son. I want to know what it was.” 

The wind shrieked in the 
lengthening silence. 

“You cost the federal govern- 
ment over a thousand dollars in 
smashed furniture this evening,” 
Hardman said sharply. “You’ve 
given the press new ammimition 
for their charge of coddling and 
lax administration.” 

“I’m sorry about that part,” 
Grayle said. 

“When you ran amok, you 
knew the effect it would have. 
You knew it would hurt your- 
self, me, the entire prison sys- 
tem.” 

Grayle said nothing. 

“You realize what you’re ask- 
ing for?” A harsh note rang in the 
official’s voice. 

For an instant, Grayle’s eyes 
locked with Hardman’s; there 
seemed to be some message there, 
almost readable. Then the prison- 

GALAXY 



er glanced away indifferently. 

“I’m ordering you to the maxi- 
mum security detachment at Gull 
Key, Grayle.” 

Grayle nodded, almost impa- 
tiently, the governor thought. 

“I don’t like it,” he said. “I 
don’t like to admit failure with 
a man; but the best interest of 
Caine Island comes first.” 
“Certainly, Governor,” Grayle 
said softly. “I understand.” 
“Damn it, man, I’m not apolo- 
gizing! I’m doing my duty, noth- 
ing more!” The governor put his 
hand under the edge of the desk, 
touched something hidden there. 

“I’ve switched off the record- 
ing system,” he said swiftly. 
“Speak up now, man! Tell me 
what this is all about!” 

“Better switch it back on. You 
will have the guards breaking the 
door down.” 

“Talk, man! Gull Key is no 
picnic ground!” 

“That’s all I have to say. Gov- 
ernor. You’re wasting your time.” 
Hardman’s face flushed He 
keyed a button on the desk top 
viciously. 

“All right, Grayle,” he said 
flatly as the door slid back and 
the guard entered alertly. “That’s 
all. You can go now.” 

Grayle walked out of the room 
without a backward glance.

ant trees and spilling down along 
the shore, men and women run 
down to gather on the beach; 
many of them wade out waist- 
deep in the bitter water to lay 
hands on the boat, shouting their 
greetings to the returned way- 
farers. The prisoner climbs over 
the side with the others, grasps 
a rope, helps draw the ship up 
on the strand. Standing by the 
bow, he watches as the men caper, 
embracing the thick-bodied, 
snub-nosed women whose yellow 
hair hangs in thick braids down 
their backs. One or two of the 
latter eye him curiously, but they 
do not speak. 

“Stand forth, slave,” a deep 
voice booms out. A man comes 
toward him, a length of rope in 
his hands. He is tall, massive, 
with a tangled blond beard and 
shaggy hair, clad in garment of 
leather. Against his chest, the 
Star of Deneb and the golden 
Cross of Omrian glint among the 
polished beats’ teeth strung on a 
rawhide thong. “Ifs time to truss 
and brand the bull for market, 
before he get loose among the 
cows.'” he shouts cheerfully. 

The captive moves a step side- 
ways. 

“Come and get me, Olove 
Brassbeard,” he calls awkwardly 
in the language of the barbarians. 

Olove motions with his free 
hand. “Bor! Grendel! Seize me 
that slave!”

Two big men come forward, 
smiling large smiles through 
bushy beards. 

“It might be good sport to see 
Olove bind me with his own 
hands,” the captive says. Bor 
hesitates. 

“It he can,” the slave adds. 
Grendels grin widens. He spits 
on the rocky ground. “The sea-law 
doesn't run here ashore, Olove. 
The voyage is over. You hold a 
rope in your hands, bind him 
with it — if you dare.” 

“You expect me, a chieftain, to 
soil my hands on a slave?” 

“How say you, outlander?” 
Grendel inquires. Were you a 
man of rank in your own town?” 

“I was a Captain-Lieutenant,” 
the prisoner gives the title in his 
own tongue. 

“He ties,” Olove blusters. “He 
iras alone, without retainers or 
men-at-arms, clad only in a poor 
rag — ” 

“He wore ornaments of gold,” 
Half says, enjoying himself. “The 
same ones we now see wiriking 
among the fleas on your chest.” 

No doubt he stole them from 
his master ere he fled,” Olove 
grunts. 

“His ring fit uncommon well 
for a stolen one,” Hulf says. “You 
had to hew away the finger to 
take it.” 

Brassbeard makes sputtering 
sounds; then he snorts and throws 
a^de his wolfskin cloak. He flexes 
28 



his arms, spits, and charges, his 
thick, bowed legs pumping like 
pistons. 

The captive stands unmov- 
ing. As Brassbeard closes, he 
pivots minutely, elevates his left 
forearm to deflect the chieftain's 
outstretched hand, leans in to 
place his elbow in the path of the 
man’s onrushing chin, swings with 
his rush to palm him on his way. 
Olove strikes the side of the ship 
full on, skids along it to fall with 
his face in the water and lie, his 
hairy legs twitching before they 
fall still. A roar of laughter goes 
up. 

Grendel comes forward and 
rolls the fallen man over. 

“Olove is dead,” he says, still 
grinning. “He dashed out his 
brains on his ship to oblige the 
stranger.” He wipes tears of mirth 
from his eyes, turns to the former 
slave, puts out a hand, clasps 
him below the elbow. 

“The gods declare you to be a 
freeman,” he says. “By what 
name do your friends call you?” 

“Gralgrathor,” the man an- 
swers. 

“Welcome to Bjornholm. Grail 
Grathor. Come, my wife will find 
food and a pallet for you, and we 
wilt share a flask or two. And 
for amusement,” he adds in a 
lower tone, “you may teach me 
the spell you used to turn Glove's 
wrath into a madness that de- 
stroyed him.”

G eorge, tHe nigHt man at Smit- 
ty’s Conditioning Parlor 
and HealtG Club, laid aside his 
paper as the buzzer sounded and 
feet descended the short flight of 
steps from street level. A tall, 
quick-moving man with a badly 
scarred face came into the room 
pulling off his coat. 

“Yessir,” George said, coming 
to his feet in a quick motion for 
all of his two hundred and nine- 
ty pounds of bulk, smiling, sizing 
up the newcomer. He noted the 
soiled cuffs, the wilted and grimed 
collar, the tear in the dusty knee 
of the trousers. But the suit was 
cut from a good grade of worsted, 
real wool, it looked like, and the 
big brogans were almost new un- 
der the dust and scuff marks. 
And the socks were a tasteful 
solid, none of those purple 
clocks. The guy Had been out on 
the tiles, all right, but there was 
some quality there. He was no 
bindlestiff just drifting in out of 
the damp night air. George 
caught the jacket as the man 
tossed it aside. 

“Sponge and press the suit, sir?” 
he said. “Do it for you nice, while 
you’re in the steam.” 

“Never mind that,” the big man 
said. The scars on his face moved 
as he spoke, the big one across 
the cheek dimpling as if in a 
puckish smile, the one crossing

his forehead and running back in- 
to the scalp lifting quizzically, 
sardonically. He shucked bills 
from a folded sheaf, tossed them 
on the table. 

“My body’s full of poison,” he 
said. “I want heat. Lots of heat.” 

An elderly man, naked and 
shrunken, emerging from the in- 
jfrared room, jerked his head 
sharply at sight of the newcom- 
er. He halted, watching the scar- 
red man strip. He seemed fas- 
cinated by the scars, large and 
small, that marked the powerfully 
muscled chest, back, thighs. 

“I’m carrying one-twenty in 
the wet room, one-eighty in the 
sauna,” George said. Five min- 
utes of that be all you can take.” 

“Call me in ten.” 

George watched the glass door, 
smiling a little to himself. He 
folded some towels, opened and 
shelved a carton of soap. Ten 
minutes, the man say. Like to 
see the man could take ten on 
them hot teak boards. First 
couple minutes go easy; then it 
start to get hot. Ten minutes. 
George chuckled. Door be open- 
ing any minute now. Big man be 
out, gasping like a catfish on the 
bank. He looked at the clock. 
Five minutes almost up. Through 
the clear glass he saw the scarred 
man sitting bolt upright, swing- 
ing his arms. Hoo-ee. That white 
man crazy, have to watch him, 
get him out when he faint. 

29 



I 'hat fellow’s asking for a 
heart attack,” the old 
man spoke suddenly beside 
George. He had come up silent- 
ly, rubber-sandaled. He ruffled 
his wispy hair with a towel. 
“WKat was that he said about 
poison?” 

“Booze, Doctor,” George said. 
He meant the booze. Smell it on 
him.” 

It was eleven minutes before 
the scarred man strode from the 
dry heat room, his body pouring 
with sweat. A sickly odor of al- 
cohol hung thick about him. 
George stared. 

“Cold water?” the big man 
said curtly. 

“Deluge showers, right to your 
right.” George pointed. 

“Good way to get yourself a 
coronary attack,” the old fellow 
called after him. 

The scarred man stood in the 
stall, dousing himself with icy 
water. He breathed in great, 
shuddering gulps. Afterwards, he 
spent ten minutes in the steam 
room, ten more in the sauna, 
showered again. By then the reek 
of raw alcohol had dissipated. 

“You know massage?” he ask- 
ed George. George’s wide black 
face crinkled in a smile. 

“Some say I do pretty good.” 
He nodded toward the padded 
table. The scarred man waved 
aside the proffered towel, stretch- 
ed out face down. His back was 
30 



solidly muscled about the shoul- 
ders, tapering sharply to a lean, 
hard waist. A deep scar ran down 
across the left trapezius to end 
near the spine. Lesser scars — 
line, pocks, zigzags — were scat- 
tered over his hide in random dis- 
tribution. Under George’s Hands 
the flesh felt hard, ropy. 

“You ever in the ring?” the 
masseur inquired. 

“Not much.” 

“That fight racket no life for a 
man.” 

“Harder,” the scarred man said. 
“I want to feel it.” 

“Got to be careful,” George 
chuckled. Man come home with 
bruises, his sweety wonder why.” 
“Say,” the old man said. “Mind 
if I ask how you got the scars?” 
The big man turned his head 
to look at him. 

“I’m a doctor, a medical doc- 
tor,” the old fellow said. “I’ve 
never seen anything quite like 
the way you’re marked up.” 

“I got them in the wars,” the 
big man said. George shot the 
oldster a pursed-mouth look. 

“Don’t shush me, George,” the 
old man said. “My interest’s le- 
gitimate.” 

( C ot a little rheumatism 
there?” George asked. His 
hard, pink-palmed hands explor- 
ed a lump under the client’s skin. 
The elderly medical man came 
over, frowned knowingly down at 

GALAXY 



tKe man stretched oh the table, 
“Be careful, George,” he or- 
dered. “You take it easy with 
those Hands of yours.” He leaned 
for a closer look at the deep fis- 
sure, keloid ridged, that crossed 
the kidney region. 

“Feel like some kind of lump 
there,” George said. “Feel hot, 
too.” He stepped back, looking 
at the doctor. The old man’s thin 
fingers ran over the visible swell- 
ing at the lower edge of the prone 
man’s ribs. 

“Why, there’s a bullet lodged 
in there,” he said. “You been shot, 
Mister?” 

“Not recently.” 

“Hmmm. Must have entered 
along here ...” the thin old fin- 
ger traced up along he big man’s 
side. “Right here,” he said. “Here 
is your point of entry. Traveled 
right along the rib cage.” 

The medical man broke off, 
staring at an angry, reddish 
swelling developing at the spot 
under which the bullet lay. 

“George, what did you do, 
gouge in with those big thumbs 
of yours? I told you to take it 
easy!” 

“You lie easy. Mister,” the 
doctor said. “You have some in- 
fection there, that pretty plain. 
I have my kit with me. I think 
I’d better give you a hypo of 
PN-43 — ” 

“No,” the big man said. He was 
gritting his teeth, his back tensed. 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



'T know what it is. But I’d for- 
gotten how it feels.” 

As the doctor and the masseur 
watched, the contusion grew, 
flushing dusky purple now, a 
three-inch splotch against the 
tan skin. A patch of paleness 
grew at its center, spread to the 
size of a steel dollar. 

“Hey, doctor!” George said — 
and broke off as the swelling burst 
the skin splitting dark blood and 
clear matter, exposing a grayish 
lump. 

The doctor uttered an ex- 
clamation, scuttled across to an 
open locker, jerked out a green 
plastic instrument case, opened 
it on a bench, hurried back. With 
a shallow, spoon-shaped probe, he 
levered at the wound, lifted out 
a slightly misshapen lump of lead 
as big as the end of his thumb. 
The big man sighed harshly and' 
relaxed. 

“How long ago did y®u say 
it was you were shot?” the doc- 
tor asked in a strained voice, eye- 
ing the big slug that was lying in 
his palm. 

“Quite a while.” 

“I should say so.” The old man 
barked a short laugh. “If it were 
not so ridiculous, I’d swear that 
was a genuine Minie ball.” 
“Minie ball? What was that?” 
George asked, his eyes rolled like 
a horse smelling smoke. 

“That’s what they used in the 
Civil War,” the doctor said.

T he scarred man smiled slightly. 

“I need food,” he said as lie 
pulled on fiis shirt. "Is there a 
restaurant nearby that you can 
recommend, George?” 

“Happen I got a nice slab of 
sirloin in my cooler right this, 
minute,” the black man said. 
“And eggs, too. About half a doz- 
en sound right?” 

The scarred man took the fold 
of bills from his pocket and 
shucked off a fifty, laid it on the 
rubbing table. 

“Rare. And over lightly.” 
“Say,” the doctor said. “Funny 
thing. The scars on your face; 
they look different.” 

The scarred man turned to the 
full-length wall mirror. He went 
close, studying his features. The 
furrow across his cheek, that Had 
pulled his mouth into a perpetual 
faint grin, had faded to a shallow, 
pinkish line. The broad band of 
lumped scar tissue across hi$ 
forehead was now no more than a 
faint discontinuity in the smooth 
tan of his skin. 

“Never saw anything like it,” 
the old man said in tones of won- 
derment. “Those scars are fading 
right out. Just disappearing.” His 
hand moved, caught itself. “You 
will pardon my curiosity,” he 
said, edging around for a better 
view. “But as a man of science — ” 
“They weren’t as bad as they 
looked,” the formerly scarred 
man said shortly, turning away. 

32 



“Look here, my friend, I’m 
Dr. Henry Cripps. Hank to my 
friends. Now, I’ve had some ex- 
perience vdth contusions and the 
like during over forty years of 
practice. I know a third-degree 
scar when I see one. A thing like 
that doesn’t just diappear in the 
space of a quarter of an hour — ” 

“Doctor, I’m not in need of 
medical attention, thank you, 
anyway,” the big man said. The 
oldster clamped his jaw, retired 
to the far side of the room, from 
where he stared at the object of 
his professional curiosity. An 
odor of cookery wafted into the 
room through the open doorway 
to a back room. The big man 
paced up and down, flexing his 
arms. 

“Itches, doesn’t it?” Cripps 
spoke up. 

“A little.” 

“Damnedest thing I ever saw.” 

F ive minutes of silence ensued. 
George appeared at the door. 
“On the table,” he said. The 
big man followed him back to 
the small, neatly arranged living 
quarters. He seated himself and 
attacked the thirty-two ounce 
steak. George put a big glass of 
milk in front of him. He drained 
it, asked for a refill. He ate the 
eggs, mopped the juices from the 
plate with a scrap of toast. 
George brought in a foot-wide 
pie, lifted a quarter of it onto a 

GALAXY 



plate, put a half-pint mug of 
coffee beside it. 

“Can’t get that kind in the 
store,” he said. “I got a lady 
friend brings them around.” He 
watched as his guest finished off 
the dessert, drained the cup. 

“Better hang onto that lady 
friend, George,” the big man 
said. He rose. “Thanks. I needed 
that.” 

“I reckon,” George agreed, 
“Too bad Lucy-Ann not here to 
see you tuck it in. Do her good 
to see a man eat” 

“By God,” Doctor Cripps said. 
“Will you look at that, George? 
You can scarcely see where the 
scars were. They’re remitting 
completely.” 

George shook his head, accept- 
ing the evidence of his eyes philo- 
sophically. 

“Nothing like a good feed to 
set a man up,” he commented. 

“Look here,” Cripps said as the 
subject of the discussion headed 
from the room. “Would you mind 
just letting me have a look at 
your back?” 

“I’m sorry. I’m in a hurry.” 

“But damn it, this is medical 
history in the making — if you 
would let me observe it! I have a 
camera in my apartment, a few 
blocks from here I should photo- 
graph this, document it — ” 

“Sorry.” The big man picked 
up his coat. 

“At least let me examine the

woimd I dressed. You owe me 
that much.” 

“All right” The big man strip- 
ped off his shirt. The doctor’s 
eyes goggled at the sight of the 
ivide, unmarked back. He put out 
a hand, touched the smooth iddm 
There was no trace of any injury 
anywhere in the patient’s skin. 

“Sir,” he said in a choked voice, 
“you must come along with me 
to St .John’s Hospital, You must 
allow this to be studied by com- 
petent authorities — ” 

The big man shook !Bs head. 
“Out of the question.” He donned 
his shirt, tied his tie, pulled on his 
coat He put another fifty-dollar 
bill on the table. 

“Thanks, to both of you,” He 
said. “I hope that will cover your 
fee, doctor,” 

“Never mind my fee!” 

“It’s late,” the big man said 
gently. “Maybe you were imag- 
ining things.” 

“George, you saw if too,” 
Cripps exclaimed, turning to the 
Negro. 

“Doctor, seem like sometimes 
I got a powerful bad memory.” 
George smiled dreamily, loekmg 
at the bill. 

They watched in shence as tfic 
big man went up the stej^ 
“Where can I reach you?” 
Cripps called as he put a hand 
on the door. “I’ll want to foHow

“I don’t want any trouble out

his eyes were sharp on Grayle’s.

Tfie man made a noise deep in

passed in silence then the lieu- 
tenant stepped back. 

“I guess I’ll give Kina a break,” 
he said loudly to the sei^eant. 
“This boy won’t give us any 
trouble. He’s got enough trou- 
ble. He’ll want to hit Gull clean 
— as clean as His kind can be. 
Cuff Kim up in front.” 

The sergeant seemed the man- 
acles. The four armed men boxed 
the prisoner. Metal clanged as 
steel doors opened on a bare 
chamber. They walked in. The 
doors closed. Two of the men 
pushed buttons at opposite ends 
of the small room. A Heavy pan- 
el slid aside on a big bright-lit 
garage where two massive gray- 
painted vehicles bearing the let- 
ters CIFP were parked. An at- 
tendant unlocked a door at the 
rear of one; one of the guards 
stepped up into the windowless 
compartment, covered Grayle as 
he entered. A second guard came 
aboard, and the door closed. Locks 
snicked. 

“You sit there.” The guard in- 
dicated a low bench with a slop- 
ing back mounted against the 
driver’s compartment. When 
Grayle was seated in it, knees 
high, his weight on the end of 
his spine, a locking bar slid into 
place across his ribs and sealed 
with a click. The two guards 
strapped into the contoured 
chairs mounted at the sides of the 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



car. Each pressed a button set in 
the arm-rest of his chair. 

“In position,” one said. Grayle 
heard a soft sound, saw a minute 
movement of the tiny glass prism 
set in the ceiling. It studied Kim, 
then swivelled to inspect the 
guards. The light died behind it. 
A moment later the turbines 
started up with a muted howl. 

Grayle felt the car move for- 
ward; He sensed the raising of the 
flint-steel door, was aware of a 
sense of enclosure as the vehicle 
entered the upward-slanting tun- 
nel. 

One of the guards stirred in his 
seat. He was a young fellow, with 
a bone-and leather face, promin- 
ent teeth. 

“Just try something, boy,” He 
said in a husky whisper. “I hear 
you’re a tough boy. Let’s see 
can you break from us.” 

“Shut up, Jimbo,” the other 
man said. “He ain’t going no- 
place.” 

“Just to Gull, is all,” Jimpo 
said. He smiled, exposing un- 
tended molars. “You think Ke’ll 
like it there, Randy?” 

“Sure,” Randy said. “His kind 
likes it tough.” 

Grayle ignored their conversa- 
tion. He was listening to the 
muted, echoic roar of the car’s 
passage through the Kimdred- 
yard tunnel. The tone changed as 
the car slowed, started up-grade, 
chainged again as it moved ahead

on tHe level. The^ had emerged 
now onto the causeway linking 
the islands. Quickly the car built 
up speed. In six minutes they 
would pass over the Boca Ciega 
cut, the deep-water tidal-flow 
channel spanned by a single-lane 
bridge. Grayle tensed, counting. 

W hen Weather Control a^t 
Kennedy alerted the satel- 
lite that the weather patrol craft 
was airborne, estimating five min- 
utes to contact, the object of the 
meteorologist’s attention had 
grown to an estimated diameter 
of four miles. Its rotation was 
clearly visible now. 

“About five minutes for a com- 
plete revolution,” Bunny said. 
“That means winds topping sixty 
at the periphery already. And 
she’s holding position as if she’d 
dropped anchor.” 

“Kennedy is patching us direct- 
ly in on the ground-to-air,” Fred 
said. Ho plugged a hand micro- 
phone into a jack beside the 
screen. A faint crackle sounded, 
then the voice of the pilot came 
through loud and clear 

. getting dark fast, Bui ifs 
clear as a bell out here, sea calm. 
I see some fishing boats down 
there, like ducks on a pond. Fni 
holding ten thousand.” 

“He ought to be spotting some 
sign of it,” Bunny muttered. “He 
is within fifty miles of it.” 
“Hold everything, Kennedy 



Tower,” the pilot’s tone changed. 
“/ have something . like a 
twister, a funnel. Black as soof. 
Looks kind of strange, hard 
edges like cast metal. Just sitting 
there on the horizon, maybe for- 
ty miles dead ahead.” 

“Roger, Navy oh-nlne-three,” 
the Kennedy controller said. 
“Close to ten miles and orbit the 
fix. Better give us the cameras 
on this from now on.” 

“Cameras already rolling. Fm 
getting a hard echo off tlus thing. 
Ifs big all right. It tops out at 
about fifteen thousand, six miles 
wide. It looks like a mountain 
standing on its nose. Whafs hold- 
ing it up?” 

“I’ve got him on the HR 
screen, sir,” a junior technician 
called. “He’s thirty miles, clos- 
ing fast.” 

“Say, Kennedy, I’m getting 
some turbulence now,” the Nep- 
tune pilot said calmly. “I’m mak- 
ing a pass east of the bogie. This 
thing is big. I never saw an3dhing 
like this. It’s opaque. It looks 
like it’s spinning. Trailing stream- 
ers. The sea looks kind of funny 
under it. Black shadow, and. “ 
There was a five-second pause. 
“There’s a hole down there. A 
whirlpool. My God, I — ” 

if^Tavy oh-nine-three,” Ken- 
' nedy came in as the voice 
hesitated. “Repeat that last trans- 
mission.”

“I’m down to five tKousand, 
fifteen miles out. TKe thing’s 
standing up over me like an um- 
brella. I’m holding about a twen- 
ty-d^ree crab. Winds are getting 
rough. I can hear it now, roar- 
>g.” 

All right, sheer off, Ken, get 
out of that turbulence.” 
“There’s a boat down there, 
some kind of boat! She’s got her 
lights on. Looks like about a thir- 
ty footer. She’s got her stern to 
the twister. She’s . my God, 
the damned thing’s got Her! She’s 
going in!” 

“Ken, get out of there!” 
“There’s three people aboard, I 
can see them!” the pilot was 
shouting now. 

“All right. Navy oH-nine- 
three,” another voice spoke 
harshly. “Repeat course change, 
and put some snap into it!” 

“I’m . I’m making my pass 
now, north of it, five miles from 
contact. That boat — ” 

“Never mind the boat! Pick up 
a heading of 090 and put some 
distance between you and this 
thing!” 

“Turbulence is bad. She’s fight- 
ing me. ...” 

“Go to full gate, Ken! Get the 
hell out of there!” 

“She’s not reacting to control, 
Kennedy! She’s . God! I’m 
getting knocked around . it’ll 
tear her apart . !” 

“Mr. Hoffa!” the technician 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



called. “The navy plane’s Headed 
right into it!” 

“Ken! Try riding with it! Don’t 
fight it, let it take you around, 
build up airspeed, and try to 
edge out!” 

“Roger, Kennedy,” the pilot 
said. His voice was flat, emotion- 
less now, against a background 
howl. “Tell the next guy to stay 
way back, twenty miles at least. 
It’s like a magnet. I’m riding it 
like a merry-go-round. It’s like 
a black wall, two miles off my 
starboard wingtip. The noise — 
I guess you can hear it. I’m indi- 
cating four-fifty, but I”d say my 
ground speed is a couple hxmdred 
over that.” 

“Ken, try a left turn, about 
five degrees — ” 

“I’m in a tight crab, no joy, 
Kennedy. The boatfs coming un- 
der me again. It’s right on the 
edge of the drop. It — it’s break- 
ing up. Ripped wide open. It’s 
gone. Lucky at that. Fast. I’m 
getting the turbulence again. It’s 
dark in here. I’ve got my nav 
lights on. It looks like black 
glass. Buffeting’s bad now can’t 
take much of this . • . she ...” 
“Ken! Ken! Come in, Ken!” 

“It merged,” the technician 
said in a choked voice. “The plane 
flew right into it!” 

npHe sound of the tires of the 
armored vehicle changed 
tone as it started across the met- 

37 



al-grid surface of the lift span of 
the Boca Ciega bridge. As they 
did, Grayle arched his back put- 
ting pressure against the steel 
bar across his chest. For an in- 
stant it held firm then it yield- 
ed, bent like sun-warmed wax. 
One sprang free of the latch 
mechanism. At the sound, both 
guards tensed, their heads jerk- 
ing around in time to see Grayle 
eome to his feet, tense for fore- 
arms, and bend the chrome-steel 
rod between his wrists into a U, 
grip it with both Hands, and with 
a quick twist snap apart. The 
one called Randy made a stran- 
gled sound and clawed at the gun 
at his hip. Grayle plucked it from 
him, did something to it with his 
hands, threw it aside, in the same 
motion caught Jimbo as he rose, 
tapped him lightly against the 
wall, dropped him. He stepped to 
the rear of the car, gripped the 
steel rods which engaged slots at 
the sides of the double door, 
braced his feet, and lifted. One 
rod popped from its socket the 
other broke with a crystalline 
tinkle. Grayle kicked the doors 
wide; a swirl of rain wlupped 
at hint Gripping the jamb, he 
swui^ out, cav^t at the lamp 
housing above, pulled himself up 
onto the roof o£ the speeding ve- 
hicle. As He drew His legs up, 
there was a sEarp double report, 
and a sharp pang stung His left 
shin. 

38 



He rose to his knees, looking 
down at the concrete railing flash- 
ing past, at the multi-strand 
barbed wire above it, the dark 
water frothing white-capped be- 
low. He rose to His feet against 
the rushing wind, gauged his dis- 
tance and dived far out over the 
pavement and the wires as the car 
braked, tires squealing its siren 
bursting into howling life. 

The escort spent Half an hour 
patrolling the bridge on foot, 
playing powerful hand-lights 
across the water, but they saw 
no sign of the escaped convict. 

nder the hi^h-beamed roof of 
the timbered iartnhouse at 
BjoTTthoIm, the man who had 
been Gralgrathor sits at a long 
table musing over a bowl oi stout 
ale. In the fire burning on the 
hearth images of faces and figures 
form, beckon, flicker away, their 
whispering flame-voices murmur- 
ing words in a tongue tie has half- 
forgotten. Across the room Gud- 
red sits on a bench between the 
two household servant- girls, her 
youthful head bent over her nee- 
dlework. 

He pushes the bowl away, 
stands, belts a warm coat of bear- 
skin about Mm Gudred comes to 
Mm, the firelight soft on her plait- 
ed hair the color of hammered 
gold. 

“Will you sit with me by the 
fire awMle, my Grail?” she asked 

GALAXY 




soHly. Oi an iKe daughters oi Earl 
Arnulf, she alone had a voice that 
was not like the bawling oi a bull 
calf. Her touch was gentle, her 
skin smooth and iair. 

‘‘You are a fool, Grail,” the 
earl had said. “She is a sickly 
creature, who will doubtless die 
bearing your first son. But if you 
indeed choose her over one oi my 
lusty, broad-beamed wenches — 
why take her, and be done with 
it!” 

“Fm restless, girl, he tells her, 
smiling down into her face. “My 
head is fuddled with ale and too 
long lazing indoors. I need to 
walk the hills awhile to clear the 
cobwebs from my brain.” 

Her hand tightens on his arm. 
“Thor — not in the hills! Not in 
the gloaming; I know you laugh 
at talk of trolls and ogres, but 
why tempt them.” 

He laughs and hugs her close. 
Across the wide room, the cur-> 
tains of the sleeping alcove stir. 
The face of a small boy appears 
knuckling his eyes. ^ 

“See — we’ve waked Loki with 
our chatter,” Gralgrathor says. 
“Sing hhri a song, Gudred, and 
by the time you’ve stitch^ an- 
other seam in your Fairday gown. 
I’ll be back.” 

Outside, the light of the long 
northern everung gleams across 
the grain field which slopes down 
to the sea-edge. Above, the forest 
mounts the steep rocks toward 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



the pink-stained snowfields on the 
high ridges. With the old hound, 
Odinstooth, beside him, he sets 
off with long strides that in a 
quarter of an hour have put the 
home acre far below him. 

Beside him, Odinstooth growls; 
he quiets the dog with a word. 
On the hillside, a movement 
catches his eye. It is a man, wrap- 
ped in a dark cloak, approaching 
from the tongue of the forest 
that extends down toward the 
farm. Grail watches him, noting 
his slim, powerful phy&que, 
his quick, sure movements. 

The man’s course leads him 
down across the fold of the earth, 
up again toward the ledge where 
Gralgrathor waits; there is some- 
thing in his gait, his easy move- 
ments, that reminds him of some- 
one from the forgotten life. » . 

The man comes up the slope, 
his face shadowed under the cowl. 
For an instant, the heavy gray 
cloth looks like a Fleet issue 
weathercloak — 

“Thor?” a mellow tenor voice 
calls. 

Gralgrathor stands staring 
down at the newcomer, who has 
thrown back his cowl to reveal a 
lean, dark-eyed face, flame-red 
hair. 

“Lokrien — am I dreaming ” 
Gralgrathor whispers. 

The dark-eyed man smiles, 
shaking his head. He speaks in a 
strange language . but dimly, 

39 



GralgrathoT senses tHe meaning: 
“That — man, it is you! Don’t 
tell me you’ve forgotten your 
mother tongue!” 

“After all these years?” Gral- 
grathor says. “You’ve really 
come?” 

“I’ve come for you,” Lokrien 
says in the half-strange language. 
“I’ve come to take you home, 
Thor.“ 

V 

T fie governor of Caine Island 
Prison stared incredulously 
at tKe cHief of Eis guard force. 

“You wouldn’t be maMng some 
sort of ... of ill-considered joke, 
I suppose, Brasfier?” 

“No sir,” tKe wiry, dapper offi- 
cer said. He stood at parade rest, 
looking acutely uncomfortable. 
Outside tHe wind sfirieked, jeer- 
ingly. 

“It’s not possible,” tiie gover- 
nor said. “It simply isn’t possi- 
ble!” 

“It Happened on tiie bridge,” 
tKe captain said, tigHt-moutHed. 
“Just as the car crossed tKe draw- 
span.” 

“An escape,” Hardman sat rig- 
id in his chair, his face pale ex- 
cept for spots of color high on 
his cheeks. “From the coimtry’s 
only one hundred per cent es- 
cape-proof confinement facility!” 
The captain slanted Kis eyes 
at his superior. 

40 



“Governor, if you’re suggest- 
ing. ...” 

“I’m suggesting nothing — ex- 
cept that a disaster Kas occur- 
red!” 

“He didn’t get far,” the cap- 
tain said. “Not with two tranks in 
him. He went over tfie side into 
a rip tide. Tfiaf s a rougfi drop, 
at sixty miles an hour, even with- 
out the storm. We’re looking for 
the body, but — ” 

“I want the body found before 
tfie wires get tfie story! And — if 
He’s alive — ” fie stared fiercely at 
tfie officer. 

“He’s dead, sir, you can count 
on tfiat.” 

“If lie’s alive, I said, I want 
him caught, understand, Brasfier? 
Before fie readies the mainland! 
Clear.” 

Tfie captain drew a breatfi and 
let it out, making a show of self- 
control. 

“Yes sir,” fie said heavily. 
“Just as you say.” He turned 
away, giving Hardman a look 
as though there were comments 
only protocol prevented him from 
making. 

When tfie officer Kad gone, 
Hardman sat for five minutes bit- 
ing his thumb. Then he flipped 
the intercom lever. 

“Lester, I want the Grayle dos- 
sier, eversdifiing we’ve got.” 

“There isn’t much. Governor. 
You’ll recall Ke was a transfer 
from Leavenworth East — ” 

GALAXY 



“I want to see wKat we fiave.” 
Lester Hesitated. “Is it true, 
Governor? THe story going 
around is that fie more or less 
burst his way tfirougfi the side 
of an armored car.” 

“That’s an exaggeration! Don’t 
Help spread these damned rumors, 
Lester!” 

“Of course, I knew it was ridic- 
ulous. I suppose under cover of 
the storm he caught the escort 
off guard — ” 

“I want those records right 
away, Lester. And get in touch 
with Pyle at Leavenworth, see if 
you can turn up anything else on 
Grayle. Check with Washington, 
the military services, the various 
Federal agencies, Query Interpol 
and the UN PC Bureau. I want 
anything and everything you can 
turn up.” 

Lester whistled. 

“Quite a stir for one man, sir, 
isn’t it? I mean — ” 

“That man has my reputation 
in his pocket, Lester! I want to 
know all there is to know about 
him — just in case he isn’t pick- 
ed up washing around in the tide 
tomorrow morning!” 

“Of course. You know. Gover- 
nor, some of the staff have been 
repeating the stories about Grayle 
having served his time but not 
being released because the rec- 
ords were lost. They say he final- 
ly took the law into his own 
hands — ” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Nonsense. He’d have been free 
in ninety days.” 

“Just how long had fie been on 
the inside sir? I was asking Cap- 
tain BrasKer, and he — ” 

“Get me the records, Lester,” 
the governor cut him off. “I sug- 
gest you stop listening to rumors 
and get busy digging up some 
facts.” 

T ying flat among reeds on a 
' shore of sulphurous black 
mud, Grayle averted his face from 
the howling wind that drove rain 
at him in icy sheets. He rested 
for a while waiting for the dixzi- 
ness to pass, then wormed his 
way up the bank, squinting 
against the downpour. A large 
tree afforded some slight shelter. 
He settled himself with his back 
to it, set about tearing strips 
from his prison garment to bind 
around his shin, in which a high- 
velocity pellet has scored a deep 
gouge before ricocheting off the 
bone. 

On the highway above, a car 
churned past, a red strobe light 
flashing atop it, its headlights 
drowning in the almost solid 
downpour. Grayle set off along 
the shore, keeping in the shelter 
of scrub liveoak and Australian 
pines, slipping and sliding in the 
dark over the twisted roots. He 
was almost on the house before 
he saw it: a bleak cuboid of un- 
painted concrete, tin roofed, dark 



41 



and silent under tKe sodden trees. 
A small car stood in tKe sandy 
drive. Grayle went forward, skirt- 
ed the vehicle. As fie rounded it, 
a light lanced out from near tfie 
house, caught him full in tfie 
face. 

“It’s not wortfi stealing,” a 
voice called over the drum of the 
rain. “But you’re welcome to 
try.” 

The voice was tfiat of a woman. 
Grayle stood where he was wait- 
ing. 

“You’d better be on your way,” 
the voice said. “I keep a gun, you 
know. I have to, living wfiere I 
do.” She broke off; the ligfit 
wavered. 

“That’s a prison jacket.” 

The light moved over him, field 
on his face. 

“You escaped from Caine Is- 
land?” When Grayle said nothing, 
she went on: “You better get in- 
side, I heard tfie sirens a few min- 
utes ago. They’re patrolling tfie 
road.” 

grayle took two swift steps, 
swept the ligfit from her 
hand, reversed it and flicked its 
beam across the woman. Sfie was 
young, clean-featured, dark hair- 
ed, tall and slender in a weather- 
proof trench coat. Sfie didn’t 
move, but turned Ker eyes aside 
from the light. There was no gun 
in her hands. 

“I’m sorry,” Grayle said. “I 
42 



fiad to be sure.” He handed tfie 
light back to fier. Silently sfie 
turped, led tfie way into tfie 
house. Sfie switcfied on a li^t, 
pulled down tfie roller sKades. 
After tfie cold wind, tfie warmtS 
and comparative silence aivel- 
oped Grayle like a downy blanket 

“You’re hurt!” the girl said. 
Grayle braced his feet, fighting 
against a wave of dizziness. 

“Lethanol!” the girl’s voice 
came from a remote distance. “I 
can smell it on you! Sit down.” 

Tfie girl stood over him, a con- 
cerned look on her face. Water 
dripped from her Kair, running 
down Ker cheek. For an instant 
she reminded him of someone: 
the image of a face witfi ringlet- 
ted hair and a mob cap flickered 
and was gone. He couldn’t re- 
member her name. It had been 
so long, there were so many 
things forgotten. ... 

He pushed himself to his feet; 
fie must not sleep now. 

Sfie took his arm; Ke was aware 
of Ker voice, but made no effort 
to follow the words. Fragments 
of old memories danced through 
Kis consciousness: a night in the 
rain on tfie field near Cordoba; 
standing by a stone wall, white 
booted feet tramped endlessly 
past, the blue-coated troops with' 
tfieir backpacks and fixed bayon- 
ets; a sudden, vivid evocation of 
tfie odor of tarred cordage and 
creaking timbers, of blown spume

and salt fisfi, of leatHer and gun- 
powder. 

“ . stay on your feet,” tlie 
girl was saying. “I saw a demon- 
stration back at Bloomington.” 
Her voice was low, well modulat- 
ed, Her diction good. 

He Halted. “Do you Have any 
EigH protein food — meat, eggs?” 

“Yes. Good idea.” 

Grayle continued to pace up 
and down the small room. It was 
neat, clean, sparsely furnished 
with cheap plastic-and-steel-tube 
chairs and studio coucH, a thin 
rug, a bookcase built of bricks 
and board and filled with paper- 
backs. Framed magazine pictures 
decorated the walls. There were 
flowers in foil-covered tin cans. 
The kitchen was an alcove with 
a fold-out table, a minimal coun- 
tertop refrigerator, a tiny elec- 
tric range. The aroma of bacon 
and eggs was almost painfully 
sharp. 

Qhe put a plate on the table, 
added a cup of black coffee. 

“Eat slowly,” she said, watch- 
ing him swallow the egg in two 
bites. “It won’t Help you to get 
indigestion. 

“How far am I from the per- 
imeter wall?” 

“About three miles as the crow 
flies, across the bay. Nearly seven 
by road. How did you get this 
far?” 

“I swam.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Yes, but — “Her eyes went 
to the crude bandage on His shinn 
visible under his pants cuff. 

“You’re Hurt.” Without waiting 
for a reply, she knelt, with deft 
fingers opened the crude knot 
and pulled away the wet cloth. 
There was a faint pink scar 
across the tanned skin. She gave 
him a puzzled look as she rose. 

“I’ll move on now.” He got to 
His feet. “I’m grateful to you for 
your kindness.” 

“What do you intend to do? 
Just walk out there and wait to 
be caught?” 

“It will be better for you if 
you know nothing of my plans.” 
“You’re on a peninsula Here, 
there’s only one way out. They 
will have it blocked.” 

A car passed on the road. They 
listened as the growl of the en- 
gine receded. 

“They’ll be checking Here 
soon,” the girl said. “There’s a 
crawl-space above the kitchen.” 
“Why?” 

“Why not?” Her tone was de- 
fiant. 

“Why are you willing to in- 
volve yourself?” 

“Perhaps I Have a feeling for 
a man on the run.” 

He waited. 

“I had a brother at Caine Is- 
land. That’s why I bought this 
place — I was allowed to see him 
one day a week. He had nobody 
else; and neither did I.”

“Tfiat doesn’t fully explain — ” 
“He’s dead. Three months ago. 
Leukemia, they said. He was 
only thirty-four.” 

“You blame the authorities?” 
“They had him,” she said flat- 
ly. 

S carlet light struck the front 
window, glowed through the 
gap under the blind. A brilliant 
white light replaced it, pushing 
shadows across the floor. The 
growl of an engine was audible 
over the rattle of rain on the roof. 

“We waited too long,” the girl 
said tightly, 

“Stay out of the way, out of 
sight,” Grayle said. Outside, car 
doors slammed. He flattened him- 
self against the wall beside the 
door. There was a sharp rap. A 
moment later the knob turned, 
the door was thrown violently 
open. Rain blasted in. There was 
the sound of metal rasping on 
leather, the click of a safety catch 
being snapped off. A tall man in 
a shiny yellow slicker took a step 
into the room. Grayle moved 
then, caught the man’s gun 
hand, jerked him to him. 

“Don’t cry out,” he said into 
the cop’s startled face. 

“Harmon!” the man yelled. 
“Don’t — ” 

Grayle gripped him by the 
shoulder, gave him a sharp shake. 
He went slack. Grayle lowered 
him to the floor. The second man 

44 



came through the door at a dead 
run. As he passed, Grayle rapped 
him on the side of the neck; he 
fell hard, lay still. Grayle pushed 
the door shut. The girl’s eyes 
met him. 

“I never saw anyone move so 
quickly!” 

“Good-by,” Grayle cut Her off. 
“And thank you.” 

“What are you going to do?” 
“Don’t involve yourself. Miss — ” 
“Rogers. Anne Rogers.” She 
avoided looking at the two un- 
conscious man on the floor. “And 
I’m already involved.” 

“I’ll be all right. Miss Rogers.” 
“Take my car.” 

“I never learned to drive one.” 
Her face searched his face. 
“Then I’ll have to go with you.” 
She flicked off the lights, took 
out her flash, opened the door, 
stepped out into the rain. Grayle 
followed. She reached inside the 
police car, switched off the lights. 
The radio crackled and muttered. 

The inside of the small car 
smelled wet and mouldy. The 
starter groaned sluggishly. 

“I’ll have to try to jump if 
from their car.” Anne got out and 
went back to the trunk, opened it, 
took out a pair of heavy insulat- 
ed cables. Grayle lifted the hood 
for her as directed, watched as she 
attached the big copper alligator 
clips, making sparks jump and 
sputter. 

This time the starter whirled

broke into stuttering life. She 
revved it, sending clouds of ex- 
haust rolling out past the win- 
dow. 

“Hold your foot on the gas,” 
she said, and jumped out of the 
car to disconnect the cables. The 
deck lid thumped. She slid back 
in beside him. 

“Here we go. Be thinking about 
how to handle it when we get to 
the causeway.” 

Tj^or ten minutes they drove 
-*■ through torrential rain, do- 
ing a reckless twenty miles per 
hour on the glossy blacktop. 
Gusts of wind threw the light car 
across the road. No other cars 
passed them. At one point, water 
was across the road; Anne shifted 
down and crawled through. Then 
lights shone a hundred yards 
ahead. 

The red beacon of a park- 
ed police car blinked through the 
ram. 

“Stop the car.” 

She braked, pulled over, look- 
ed at him inquiringly. 

“Can you face it out if they 
search the car?” he asked. 

“What are you going to do?” 

“I’ll ride the frame.” 

“You can’t. There’s nothing to 
ride on, no room — ” 

“I’ll manage.” He stepped out 
into the storm, went flat and 
eased under the chassis. He felt 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



over me rusc-puLcu liaxuc, utaiu-

stack, groped for a handhold on

toes of his prison issue shoes over 
the rear spring hangars, lifted his 
body from the wet pavement, 
pressing against the side of the 
car. 

The girl crouched by the car, 
staring at him. 

“You are crazy! You can’t 
hold on that way! If you slip 
you’ll be killed!” 

“Go ahead, Anne,” he said. 
“I’m all right.” 

She hesitated for a moment, 
then she nodded and was gone. 
Grayle heard the gears shift; the 
car lurched as it started ahead. 
Acrid gases leaked from the rot- 
ted pipes; the car vibrated, jolting 
over the road. Oily water sleeted 
at him; gravel stung him. The 
tires hissed, close to his face. 
Then the car slowed. Lights ^one 
on the wet pavement, gliding 
nearer. He saw the wheels of an- 
other car; two pairs of booted 
feet approached, stopped a foot 
from his head; voices, indistinct 
over the rumble of the steady 
rain and the whine of the wind. 
Doors clanked; the car swayed, 
and the girl’s feet appeared. One 
policeman rounded the car; more 
door slams, more rocking. The 
deck lid opened and slammed. 
The girl got back into the driver”s 
seat. The masculine boots with- 

45 



drew. The car pulled ahead, ac- 
celerated. 

Half a mile farther on, it slow- 
to a halt. Grayle dropped clear 
and crawled out into the down- 
pour. He slid into the seat and 
met l£e girl’s eyes. 

“I still don’t believe it,” she 
said. “No one could do what you 
just did.” 

Grayle put Kis Hand on the 
door. 

“Thanks,” he said. “I’ll leave 
you now.” 

“What’s your name?” the girl 
asked suddenly. 

“Grayle.” 

“Why were you . tfiere?” She 
tilted her head toward the invisi- 
ble island behind them. 

“I killed a man.” He watched 
Her eyes. 

“In a fair fight?” 

“He almost killed me, if that’s 
what you mean.” 

“Grayle, you wouldn’t last a 
day without me. You’ve been in- 
ade too long.” 

“I Have a long way to go, 
Anne.” 

“Doesn’t everyone, Grayle?” 

He hesitated for a moment;; 
then he nodded. 

She smiled intensely, pulled 
the car back onto the road and 
gunned ahead along the dark 
road.

axes which are not decorations 
bat are ready for use, beside the 
great granite fireplace, chimney- 
less and smoky. 

“7fs a strange, barbaric world 
you found yourself castaway on, 
Thor," Lokrien says. “But you 
have a roof over your head, a 
warm fire on a cold night, good 
food and ale, a woman to comfort 
you. It could have been worse. 

“I found friends here, Gral- 
grathor says. “They could have 
killed me, but instead they let 
me into their lives.” 

“Poor creatures. I wonder wRat 
their history is? They’re human, 
of course, no doubt descendants 
of some ancient spacefarers 
wrecked here long ago. Have they 
any legends of their lost home- 
land?” 

GralgratRor nods. “It must 
Rave been long ago. Their myths 
are much distorted.” 

“There’s a certain peace and 
simplicity here — the peace of 
ignorance,” Lokrien says. “They 
Rave never heard of the Xorc. 
They don’t dream that out 
there a great Imperial Fleet is 
defending their little world 
against an enemy that could va- 
porize the planet.” 

“Perhaps in years to come, 
Thor, you’ll look back sometimes 
with nostalgia on your idyll 
among the primitives.” 

“No, Loki,” GralgratRor says. 
“It’s not earth I’ll look back on 

GALAXY 



with nostalgia. I’m staying here, 
Loki. I’m not going back with 
you.” 

Lokrien shakes his head as if 
to clear it ot some dark vision. 
“You don’t know what you’re 
saying. Never to go back? Never 
to see Fsar, to wear the uniform 
again, to sail with the Fleet — ” 
All those things, Loki.” 

“Do you know what I did to 
come here?” Lokrien says. “I de- 
serted my post in the line of bat- 
tle. I waited for a lull and turn- 
ed my boat and drove for this 
outpost world to look for you. 
It took me all these years of 
searching to pick up the trace 
from your body shield circuitry 
and find you here. With luck we 
can concoct a story to explain 
how I found you — ” 

“Loki, I cazft desert my home, 
my wife, my child.” 

“Yot?d let this savage female 
and her cub stand in the way of 
...” Lokrien hesitated. “Fm 
sorry Thor. The woman is beau- 
tiful. But Ysar! You’d give your 
whole life for this barn, these 
grubby fields, this petty bar- 
ony?“ 

“Yes.” 

“Then think of your duty to 
the Fleet.” 

“The Fleet is only a collection 
of machines, once the dream be- 
hind it is gone.” 

“You think you’ll find the 
dream, as you call it, here, on 
48 



this old backwoods world?” 
“Better a live acorn them a 
dead forest, Loki.” 

Loki looked across the gulf at 
the brother he had come to find. 
“I could force you, Thor. I still 
have my suit and my Y-gun.” 
Gralgrathor smiles a little. 
“Don’t try to decide now,” 
Lokrien says. “We’re both fired. 
We need sleep. In the morning — ” 
“In the morning nothing will 
have changed.” 

“No? Perhaps you’re wrong 
about that.” 

“There are clean furs there, 
on the hearth,” Gralgrathor says. 
“Sleep well, Loki. I need to walk 
for awhile.” 

Lokrien’s eyes follow Gralgra- 
thor as he steps out into the icy 
moonlight.

6CT et me get this straight,” 
the commander of the 
Lakewood Naval Air Station said 
grimly. “You’re telling me I lost 
a pilot in broad daylight, in a 
whirlpool?” 

“Not precisely that. Commo- 
dore Keyes,” the colonel said. 
There’s a tremendous volume of 
air involved in this thing, too. 
Friction with the water surface, 
you understand — ” 

“No, I don’t understand. May- 
be you’d better start at the be- 
ginning.” 



GALAXY 



“I have the recording of the 
pilot’s transmissions here, in the 
event you’d care to hear it” 

The commodore nodded curtly. 
The colonel hastily set up the 
small portable player, adjusted 
the tape. In a moment the pilot’s 
voice was coming through. 

The two men listened in silence 
following the recon plane’s prog- 
ress. The commodore’s face was 
set in a scowl as the tape ended. 

“All right, what are you doing 
about this thing?” 

“The nucleus of the disturbance 
is centered on a point northwest 
of Bermuda.” The colonel step- 
ped to the large world map on 
the wall and indicated the spot. 
“It’s growing steadily larger, set- 
ting up powerful winds and cur- 
rents over an area of several 
thousand square miles. Water is 
being pulled in toward the cen- 
ter from every direction, thus 
the whirlpool.” The colonel pro- 
duced a stack of photos from his 
briefcase and passed them across 
the desk. They showed a great, 
glossy-black funnel, wrapped in 
dusty spirals like disintegrating 
cotton wool batts. 

“Those were made with ultra- 
violet from about a hundred 
miles out You’ll note the calibra- 
tion marks; they show that the 
threat of the whirlpool is approx- 
imately a tenth of a mile wide 
at the surface.” 

"How wide?” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“I know it sounds incredible, 
Commodore, but I have it on 
good assurance that the figure of 
five hundred feet is accurate.” 
“Hopper, do you have any idea 
of tlie volume of water you’re 
talking about?” 

“Well, I could work it out — ” 
“How deep is the sea at this 
point?” 

“I don’t have the exact figure, 
sir, but it is deep ocean there, 
well off the continental shelf.” 
“What kind of force would it 
take to get that much water mov- 
ing at the velocity this thing 
must have? Where’s the energy 
coming from?” 

“Well, Commodore — ” 

“And you say water is flowing 
in from every direction. Where’s 
it going? And the air: the thou- 
sands of cubic miles of air on the 
move, all toward the same point. 
What’s happening to it? Where’s 
the outflow?” 

“Conunodore, we Have aircraft 
out now photographing the entire 
eastern half of the country, and 
well out into the Atlantic. And 
of course the satellite is busy on 
this thing as well. I hope to have 
some results very soon now.” 
“Find out where the water’s 
going Hopper. There’s something 
wrong here. We’re missing some- 
thing. The water Has to be some- 
where. I want to know where, 
before the biggest tidal wave in 
history hits the east coast.

I n tKe governor’s office at Caine 
Island, Lester Pale, Special 
Aide to tfie governor, sfiook Eis 
Head ruefully at Eis cEief. 

“TEe Grayle dossier isn’t mucB, 
I’m afraid, sir,” Ee said. “I Eave 
the documents covering Eis trans- 
fer from LeavenwortH East siz 
years ago; tEey’re in order. 
And of course his record Eere at 
Caine Island. But prior to that 
— ” Lester shook his head. 

“Give me wKat you’ve got,” 
Hardman spoke impatiently. He 
was hunched forward over the 
desk, raising his voice above the 
drumming of the rain that had 
increased steadily now for nearly 
six hours. 

“I talked to Warden Pyle as 
you suggested, sir. Many of his 
records were lost in a file room 
fire about twelve years ago but 
he says that of his own memory 
he recalls that Grayle was a mili- 
tary prisoner, in for the murder 
of an Army officer.” 

“Go on.” 

“The funny thing is. Governor, 
Ee was absolutely certain that 
Grayle was an inmate when Ee 
took over East L, nearly twenty 
years ago.” He paused, looking 
dubiously at his superior. 

“So?” 

“Well, after all, sir — Eow 
old is Grayle?” 

“You tell me.” 

“Well, sir — Pyle called in 
an old con, a man who had done 
50 



twenty years of a life sentence 
before parole. He works in tHe 
prison kitcEens now. Pyle asked 
him wBat Ee remembered about 
Grayle.” 

“And?” 

Lester made a disclaiming ges- 
ture. “The old fellow said that 
Grayle was one of the prisoners 
transferred from Kansas along 
with him, back in ’71. And that 
he had known him before that.” 
“How long before that?” 
“What are you talking about, 
Lester? Spell it out.” 

“Why, they’re obviously con- 
fusing the man with someone 
else. There may have been anoth- 
er prisoner with the name of 
Grayle, possibly someone with a 
physical resemblance. I don’t 
suppose they’ve had occasion to 
think of the man for a number 
of years, and now they’re dredg- 
ing up false memories, superim- 
posing our Grayle on what they 
recall of the older man.” 

CfT^hat about the Army rec- 
ords of the court-mar- 

tial?” 

Lester shook Eis Bead. “No 
success there so far, sir. I Eave a 
friend in the Pentagon who Has 
access to a great deal of retired 
material that’s never been pro- 
grammed into the Record Center. 
He supplies data to historians and 
thie like; they got a lot of requests. 
Just for the sake of thoroughness 

GALAXY 



I asked Him to dig t>ack as far 
as Se cati^ But Se informed me 
just a few minutes ago tSat He 
went Hack as far as. World War 
iTwo and turned up notliing.” 

“Did you tell Him to keepi 
looking?” 

“Well, no sir. TKat’s already 
thirty-six years back. He’s hard- 
ly likely — ” 

“Tell him to keep digging, 
Lester. You don’t send a man to 
prison for life without making a 
record of it somewhere.” 

“Governor,” a voice boomed 
sharply on the intercom. “Cap- 
tain Brasher to see you. He insist- 
ed I break in.” 

“Send him in.” 

The door opened, and the guard 
chief strode into the room, gave 
Pale a sharp look, stood waiting. 

“Well, speak up, man!” the 
governor snapped. 

“As I suspected, sir,” the cap- 
tain said, “Grayle’s alive. He 
overpowered one of my officers, 
and a state patrolman, in a shack 
on the north shore, beat them 
into unconsciousness, and got 
clear.” 

“Got clear? Aren’t the roads 
blocked?” 

“Certainly. I don’t mean he’s 
escaped the net, just that he’s 
still at large.” 

“How long ago was this?” 

The captain’s eyes snapped to 
the wall clock, snapped back. 
“Just under half an hour.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



‘Was the shack occupied?” 
“Afi — I can’t say as to tflat — ” 
“Find out. How did he leave? 
In tfie patrol car?” 

“No, it was parked In front of 
the place. That’s How — ” 
“Find out wHat kind of car 
the occupant owned. Meanwhile 
watdi every road. He can’t be 
far away. And Brasher — don’t 
let him slip through your fingers. 
I don’t care what you Have to 
do to stop him — stop Him!” 

“I’ll stop him, all right. BrasH- 
er hesitated. “You know he’s at- 
tacked three of my men now.” 
“That doesn’t say a Hell of a 
lot for your men. Brasher. Tell 
them to get on their toes and 
stay there!” 

“That’s what I wanted to Hear 
you say. Governor.” Brasher 
wheeled and left the room. 

“Governor,” Lester said, “I 
have a feeling that somewhere 
along the line there’s been a seri- 
ous mistake.” 

“Doa’l: talk like a fool, Lester. 
Graxle’s commitment papers are 
in order, I have that mucH — ” 
“I don’t mean an error on your 
part, governor. I mean prior to 
his transfer to Caine Island. Pos- 
sibly that’s why he made this 
rather desperate break. Perhaps 
he’s innocent.” 

Hardman leaned forward, his 
big hands flat on the desk. 

“He broke out of a prison un- 
der my command, Lester. I have 

51 



twenty -one years invested in this . 
business without an escape, and 
I’m not lettmg one blot a per- 
fect record, clear?” 

“Governor, this is a man’s 
life — ” 

“And of course there’s more to 
it than just my reputation,” 
Hardman said, leaning back. “If 
one man crashed out of Caine — 
and got clear — we’d have ev- 
ery malcontent on the inside mak- 
ing a try. It would be a blow at 
the entire modem penological 
system.” 

“Brasher will shoot him down 
like a dog. Governor!” 

“I gave no such orders.” 
“Brasher will interpret them 
that way!” 

“He can interpret them any 
way he likes, Lester — as long 
as he nails his man. I won’t be 
overly critical of his methods!” 

CCT’m not interested in excuses, 
Mr. Hunnicut,” the voice of 
the Deputy Under- Secretary of 
the Interior for Public Power 
rasped in the waiting ear of 
the Chief Engineer at Pasma- 
quoddie. “I’ve gone out on 
a limb for you people; Now I 
expect answers from you that 
I can give to the Committee. 
They’re looking for scalps, and 
they think mine will do!” 
“Meaning the system is a fail- 
ure! Don’t fall back on the kind 
of jargon you technical people use 
52 



to obfuscate the issues when 
things go wrong! I want it in 
plain language! Yoxir generating 
station is drawing ten per cent 
over its rated operational stan- 
dard, while the receiving stations 
report anywhere from thirty to 
forty per cent effectiveness. Now 
just tell me in words of one 
syllable — where is all that pow- 
er going, Mr. Hunmcut? 

“It’s obvious there’s a leakage 
somewhere, Mr. Secretary,” Htm- 
nicut said, holding his temper. 

“Where? In the transmission 
end? In the receiving stations? Or 
in the giant brains that dreamed 
up this fiasco?” 

“Mr. Secretary, this is a wholly 
new area of technology! There 
are bound to be certain trial-and- 
error adjustments — ” 

“Hogwash! You didn’t men- 
tion that when you were plead- 
ing with Appropriations for an- 
other himdred million!” 

“Look here, this isn’t as simple 
a matter as tracing the point of 
breakdown in a conventional line- 
transmission system — and even 
there, it sometimes takes days to 
pinpoint the trouble. Remember 
the New York blackout in the 
sixties, and — ” 

“Don’t give me a history les- 
son, Hunnicut! Are you telling me 
that anybody and his dog Rex 
can tap our broadcast system at 
will, and there’s nothing we can 
do about it?” 



GALAXY 



“Wait a minute, I didn’t say 
tKat — ” 

“The newspapers will say it! 
Give me a better line to feed to 
them!” 

“Mr. Secretary, you Have to 
imderstand, we have no instru- 
ments, no proceedures for this sit- 
uation! It’s totally unprecedent- 
ed, contrary to theory, inexplic- 
able — ” 

“It’s happening, Mr. Hunnicut! 
Better align your theories!” 

“We’ve made a start. We’ve 
rigged some makeshift field den- 
gity sensors, and I have four mo- 
torized teams out running retir- 
ing search curves, plotting the 
gradient — ” 

“Meaning what?” 

“Meaning that with luck we’ll 
detect a pattern that will enable 
us to triangulate on the point of 
power drain.” 

“Back to that! I can’t give that 
to the press, Hunnicut! They”!! 
drag in everything from Russians 
to Little Green Men from Mars! 
‘Aliens steal US power.’ I can see 
the headlines now!” 

“It’s nothing like that! I’m 
pretty sure we’ll find it’s some 
sort of anomalous natural forma- 
tion that’s drawing off the energy! 
A massive ore deposit, something 
of that sort!” 

“Hunnicut — you’re babbling! 
Just between us — what do you 
really think it is that’s drinking a 
couple of hundred thousand kilo- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



watts per hour out of the air?” 
“Mr. Secretary, I don’t know.” 
“I’m glad you admit it, Hun- 
nicut. Now I suggest you get busy 
and find out, before I yank you 
out of that plush office and put 
in somebody with a little better 
grasp of the dynamics of modern 
politico- technology ! 

“I’m no politician! I — ” 
“Locate that leak, Hunnicut — 
or you’ll be back taking gamma 
counts on the Lackawanna pile!” 

A nne Rogers stared out tHrougS 
the rain blurred windshield 
at the almost invisible road sur- 
face unwinding ahead. At wide 
intervals the lights of a lonely 
house shone weakly through the 
downpour slanting through the 
headlights. 

“There’s a town about five 
miles ahead,” she said. “We 
should change cars there.” 

They rode in silence for a few 
minutes. More lights appeared 
ahead. They passed a gas station, 
dark and deserted. Anne made a 
left turn at a blinking yellow 
traffic light, followed a broad 
truck route for half a mile, then 
took a right into a narrow resi- 
dential street. The trees lining the 
way provided some shelter from 
the rain. They moved along at a 
crawl, lights dimmed. There were 
cars parked at the side of the 
curbless street and in the weed- 
grown yards. 



53 



“They’re worse wrecks than 
this one,” Anne said, accelerating 
past an empty stretch. “We might 
as well pick a good ©ne while we 
are at it.” 

' “I’ll rely on your judgment,” 
Grayle said with the slightest 
hint of humor. 

Anne glanced at him sideways. 
“You were inside so long, I sup- 
pose everything looks strange to 
you. IV^ God, what a terrible 
thing, to take a man’s freedom 
away! I’d rather be killed and be 
done with it.” 

“It wasn’t as bad as all that. 
There’s a certain peace to be 
found in the monastic life, 
after — ” 

“After what?” she said softly. 

He shook his head. “You would 
not understand. I’m afraid, Anne. 
You’re so terribly young.” 

“I’m twenty-five, Grayle. You 
are not more than thirty-five?” 

He didn’t answer. They passed 
through a green light, went along 
a deserted block of elderly store 
fronts, a few of which had suffer- 
'ed incongruous face-lifts which 
accentuated the shabbiness of the 
neighborhood. They slowed at a 
vacant lot where a row of identi- 
cal stamped-steel grilles and 
flimsy bumpers fronted a crack- 
ed sidewalk under a string of 
draggled pennants which beat in 
•the wind like trapped birds. A 
faded sign read: HERB GRINER 
FORD. 

54 



“New cars,” Anne said. “But 
we’d need the keys.” 

“Explain, please.” 

“You need the ignition key to 
start a car with. And even to get 
the doors open. They probably 
keep them locked in the office.” 
“Drive around the comer and 
stop there in the shadows.” 

She swung aroimd the corner 
and pulled into the black pool 
under a giant live oak. 

“Wait here.” Grayle stepped 
from the car, crossed the street 
briskly, threaded his way between 
the cars to the back door of the 
small shed. He gripped the knob, 
give it a quick twist metal tin- 
kled. He stepped inside and closed 
the door. 

^^here was a small desk, a plas- 
tic-upholstered chair with a 
burst seam, a calender on the 
wall. Wan light from a pole- 
mounted lamp at the curb shone 
on a filing cabinet, a scrap of 
worn rug, a clothes tree with a 
battered hat. 

Grayle tried the center drawer 
of the desk; it popped open with 
a small splintering sound. There 
were papers, rubber bands, paper 
clips, loose cigarettes, some pen- 
nies, a pocket knife. He tried the 
other drawers. The bottom one 
on the right contained a garishly 
colored cigar box with a curled 
lid. Inside were bunches of keys, 
four to a ring, each with an at- 

GALAXY 



tacKed tag. Grayle scanned tHem: 
Wfiite 2 Dr Fal; Gray 4 Dr Gal. 

Tfie door beside Grayle made a 
faint sound. He turned as it flew 
suddenly open. A man stepped in. 
Holding a Heavy revolver in front 
of Him. He was bald, middle-aged 
bulky in a tan Hunting jacket, 
water-soaked across tHe sHoul- 
ders, the collar turned up. He 
wore round-lensed steel glasses, 
water misted. A drop of water 
hung from the tip of his promi- 
nent nose. 

“All rigfit, just turn around 
and put your hands up again’ the 
wall, boy,” He said in a high- 
pitched, nasal drawl. He took a 
step sideways and reached for 
the telephone on the desk. Grayle 
hadn’t moved. The man paused 
his hand on the phone. 

“By God, I told you to move!” 
“Didn’t Herb tell you about 
me?” Grayle asked casually. 
Hah?” The man stared. “Wfiat 
the hell you mean?” 

“The idea was that I’d drop by 
to amfrunct the baterpomp, the 
grillik frens. Just until the rain 
lets up, you understand.” 

OH.” THe man was frowning; 
the gun dropped. “By God, why 
didn’t he let me know — ” 

T fiere was a sound from tfie 
door; the man with the gun 
whirled, bringing it up; Grayle 
took a step, struck him on the 
side of the neck with his right 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



Hand as His left swept over

man fell against tfie walk Anne 
stood in the doorway, a lug 
wrencH in Her hand, eyes wide. 

“I told you to wait,” Grayle 
said fiarsHly. 

“I ... I saw Him get out of 
one of the cars.” 

“Don’t nursemaid me, girl.” 
Grayle picked up the keys from 
the desk. “Can you decode these 
notations?” 

She glanced at the tags and 
nodded. She looked at the man 
on the floor. He was breathing 
noisily. 

He’s not Hurt,” Grayle said. 
“He’d have shot you,” he added. 

“You’re a strange man, Grayle. 
You’d really care if he shot me, 
wouldn’t you? And even him — 
and those two policemen: you 
knew what you were doing, didn’t 
you. You knew just where to lut 
them, and how hard, to knock 
them unconscious without really 
hurting them. That’s important 
to you, isn’t it — not to really 
hurt anybody?” 

“We’d better go,” Grayle said. 

“I was nursemaiding you,” 
Anne said. “I suppose the idea 
you couldn’t drive, didn’t know 
your way around gave me the 
feeling you were helpless. But you 
are not Helpless. You’re less help- 
less than any man I ever saw.” 

“Which machine?” Grayle said 
brusquely.

“The white Falcon,” the girl 
said. 

“What.?” the word was explo- 
sively sharp. 

She stared at him. “We’ll take 
the white Falcon. They’re very 
common.” 

They found the car in the front 
row; it started easily; the gauge 
showed half a tank. There was a 
stale odor of cigarette smoke in 
the car; a folded map lay on the 
seat. 

“They’ve been using this one. 
That’s good. It’ll be broken in.” 
Aime examined the map. “We’ll 
cut across to 19 on 50 and head 
north. With a little luck we’ll be 
across the state line before day- 
light.” 

t the top of the lidge known 
as Snom’s Axe, Odinstooth 
whines, sniffing the air. Gralgra- 
thor strokes the old hound’s blunt 
head. The dog’s growl ends in a 
sharp, frightened yap. 

“It takes more than a bear to 
make you nervous, old warrior. 
What is it? Gralgrathor stares 
downward through the rught to- 
ward the faint park far below 
that is the firelight shining from 
his house. 

“Time we went back” he mur- 
murs. “The moon’s down; morn- 
ing soon.” 

He is half a mile from the 
house when he hears the scream, 
faint and muffled, quickly shut 
56 



off. In an instant he is running, 
the big dog bounding ahead. 

The servants are clustered in 
the houseyard, holding torches 
high. Big, bowed-back Hulf 
comes to meet him, a knobbed 
club gripped in his hands. Tears 
run down his sun-and-ice-burnt 
face into the stained nest of his 
beard. 

“You come too late, Grail,” 
he says. The big dog halts, stands 
stiff-legged, hackles up, snarling. 
Gralgrathor pushes through the 
silent huddle of housecarls. The 
bodies lie outside the thresholds 
Gudred, slim and golden-haired, 
the blood scarlet against her ice-

dead eyes seem to meet his, as if

“We heard the boy cry out, 
Grail,” an old woman says. “We 
sprang from our nests and ran 
here, to see the troll scuttling 
away, there.” She points a bony 
finger up the rocky slope. 

“Loki — where is he?” 

“Gone,” the old woman says. 
“Changed into his black were- 
shape and fled.” 

Gralgrathor plunges into the 
house. The embers on the hearth 
show him the empty room, shad-

The City That Loves You 

by RAY BANKS 

No man had ever fried to leave 
the City before Wormser. The 
City took care of — everything. 



T Sey Eave never understood 
tHe city. TEey will never un- 
derstand it. Man recognizes one, 
himself, and Ee recognizes multi- 
plicity, outside-self. Man thinks 
of Eimself as an on-off switch. He 
is eitEer-or. TEe more sophisticat- 
ed eitiier-and-or . 

How laugEingly simple! Man 
is always less than one. All his 
organizations are less than one. 
Fortunately, man lives by his 
unconscious, vdiicH does not con- 
cern itself with the sad lies of 
his conscious mind. Therefore, do 
not listen to what men say, but 
watch what they do — if you care 
to learn the secrets . 

Wormser woke up with a start. 
His room was terribly hot, suf- 
focating. He felt sweaty, uneasy 
between his legs, and his night 
jacket was plastered to his back. 



THE CITY IS YOUR FATHER. 
That was the sign that greeted 
him every morning in this little 
apartment in the City of Reflex. 
It was an ancient city of an an- 
cient, knowledgable race, and he 
was here and glad to be here. Ex- 
cept that it was too hot. 

As soon as he got out of the 
bed, glad to leave its insuffer- 
able embrace but stumbling and 
thick-minded, the room began to 
cool. New York had nothing like 
this. Earth had nothing like this. 
The ridiculous, strained earth 
colonies in space — on Mars, 
Saturn’s moons, Pluto — had no 
real cities, only stockades against 
the hard arithmetic of space. But 
the Reflexians out near Alpha 
Centauri, on a planet of the dou- 
ble star system — ahhhh, this was 
a City!

Tfie rooixi cooled rapidly, and 
His sweat disappeared. THe win-i 
dows opaqued, tKen cleared to re- 
veal tKe blxiisH, startling cool 
dawn so deligStful on AlpHa. 
Gradually tKe windows turned 
sugary iwHite and vanisKed; tHe 
pure air of Reflex poured in on 
him. It was a wine-cold, bracing 
air that urged the lungs to draw 
deeper morning breaths; he did. 
He was cleaned immaculately by 
his suit, ultrasonically, the pleas- 
ant vibrations shaking every flake 
of dirt from his skin — mucK 
cleaner than soap and water, 
without the temperature shock 
and drying effect of the latter. 

By the time he had reached Gis 
breakfast table. His suit Had been 
done for h im just before He awak- 
ened; no use to spend waking 
Hours in sucH a senseless waste of 
time. It was a device in the col- 
lar of his suit He wasn’t sure How 
it worked. In tHe silver mirror 
across from His Kght wood table 
He looked refreshed, clear-eyed, 
sober and sane. He felt quite 
good. For five years he Had awak- 
ened thus, though on Earth he’d 
been a poor awakener, Hating 
tKe mornings. But not on Reflex. 

T Tis breakfast was ready as Ke 
Had imagined it, before say- 
ing the words aloud: “Execute 
Breakfast.” THe bacon and eggs 
smelled good, looked good and 
tasted good. Sick? He couldn’t 
THE CITY THAT LOVES YOU 



remember the last time in tfie 
City fie Had felt sick. Tfiose same 
delicate fiigfi-frequency radio 
waves tfiat watcfied over all diag- 
nosed any trouble in fiis body be- 
fore fie knew it Himself and com- 
municated witli His city suit, 
iwfiicfi led Him to appropriate 
drugstores or doctors. Now that 
was the way to run medicare and 
keep down costs. 

PsycHological ills received tfie 
same sensitive attention, he re- 
flected cozily, dialing his pro- 
gram for tfie day. Detecting neu- 
roses in fiis tfiougfit, word or 
deed, tfie City allowed him to 
gratify His wisHes if they were 
Harmless, or brougfit him to a 
corrective clinic if they were fan- 
tasies demanding rejection. 

Machine-dominated, his eartfi 
friends would call Him. HaH! 
Macfiine-supported! WHy waste 
time on inconsequentials like 
maintenance errands or petty ill- 
nesses. SucH waste in an unatten- 
tive City was neurotic! 

He studied His work program 
for tHe day indifferently on the 
computer read-out. Expertly His 
eyes sought out tHe words LEI- 
SURE PERIOD wherever it ap- 
peared. He cfiuckled. Even in 
Reflex a certain amount of loaf- 
ing was good, necessary and ac- 
cepted. 

Then Ke saw tfie brand new 
REJECT button on the machine; 
full memory flooded back. To- 

59 



day, at the five-year mark, Ke 
was a full-fledged citizen of Re- 
flex. He had passed his noviti- 
ate. 

Fascinated Ke pushed tKe RE- 
JECT button and watched his 
program disappear. His plate was 
empty; he rose, stretched luxuri- 
ously and yawned. He felt the 
missing support of his daily pro- 
gram, but knew this was expect- 
ed of new citizens. 

He went to the deep-space ra- 
dio and dialed the Saturn mis- 
sion, knowing that his eyes danc- 
ed and a smile lurked at the edge 
of his lips. It took a while for 
the screen to clear and for con- 
tact with Saturn to be made, 
so many parsecs from here. But 
there was Butler, older and gray- 
er and looking astonished as 
Wormser knew he would. 

“Robert Wormser, Sociologist 
First Class, Saturn Mission, re- 
porting,” he said. 

“For God’s sake,” said Butler. 
“After all this time!” 

“I told you I’d call in a couple 
of years,” said Wormser. “On the 
day they made me a citizen of 
Reflex. It happened last night;” 
“Man!” said Butler. “This is 
a red-letter day! You’re the first 
to report back in months and 
months out of the ten people on 
the last mission.” 

“I ratlier thought so. I’ve seen 
some of the others, talked to 
them. We have a club here. 
60 



Around Reflex you get interest- 
ed in other things besides the 
Saturn mission.” 

“Are you coming back?” asked 
Butler anxiously. “Are we going 
to get that report we sent the ex- 
pedition for? Or will they stop 
you?” 

'fl^ormser smiled. “You’re na- 
^ ^ ive. There isn’t any ‘they.’ 
Just the city of Reflex. It’s not a 
political party, or bureaucracy — 
it’s just an intelligent, well-run 
city. I can leave whenever I want 
and come back whenever I want, 
now that I’m a citizen.” 

“You’re coming back, then.” 
“Of course I’m coming back. 
I told you two years ago I’d come 
back when I got my citizenship.” 
Others have promised,” said 
Butler darkly. “Something al- 
ways happened. Not a single man 
or woman ever came back.” 
“Tomorrow for sure,” said 
Wormser. 

Oh, sure,” said Butler. “Wil- 
liams promised to come back. He 
was leaving tomorrow, but we 
never saw him. Nor any of the 
others.” 

“Oh, Williams is around,” said 
Wormser. “He may come back 
some day. Butler, you just don’t 
understand either me or the 
City. The others thought they’d 
make a qtiick study and come 
back; they’re still here, or dead. 
Ours and those of earlier expedi- 

GALAXY 



tions. But I came to experience 
Reflex through every sense and 
nerve. I entered it with as blank 
a mind as one can Have. I gave 
myself to the City, and the City 
gave itself to me. Now it doesn’t 
matter whether I leave or not. I 
am the City, it is me, and I will 
come back. to make a full, detail- 
ed report, with film, statistics, 
books, recordings and personal 
observations. I’ve already packed 
the space ship.” 

“I’ll believe it when you get 
Here,” said Butler, obviously im- 
pressed nevertheless. 

“Tomorrow,” said Wormser. 
“Maybe tonight.” He chuckled as 
he broke the connection. 

Ominous? Dangerous? The in- 
credible phalanx and array of up- 
rising apartments, level upon lev- 
el, swept away from his feet above 
him, where the topmost apart- 
ments blended into a gray sky. 
His dawn was a sunlight rico- 
cheted down a million morning 
windows, past gaily-colored stone 
and somber aluminum. Now al- 
ready people moved on the levels 
outside. 

Wormser went to the table and 
His programmer. He punched out 
the message carefully “T-R-I-P.” 

Hold him? Subvert Him? Im- 
prison him? Now that his noviti- 
ate was past, now that He was a 
citizen, why would the City do 
this? 

The wfiite buttons snapped up, 
THE CITY THAT LOVES YOU 



the programmer made a HgEt 
whirring sound and was still. 
Message received. Robert Worm- 
ser went to the door of his apart- 
ment and out into the City to see 
what it had in store for him. 

T Te moved in luxury at a lei- 
* surely pace, with no sched- 
ule to fulfill, without the subtle 
pressuring of the great machine 
City to urge him to work. In the 
City idleness was a pain, like a 
dull toothache that nagged you 
until you fulfilled your sched- 
ule. You fell into the habit of 
work because then you felt good. 

Today as a citizen. He enjoyed 
the pleasure of stopping for a 
morning drink in a bar where' 
a few other citizens dallied. The 
liquor tasted unfamiliar, sweet at 
such an imaccustomed time. But 
good. Now if there were only 
someone to — 

“Hello, Wormser!” 

He turned and recognized 
Snell, an Earthman, one of the 
ten who Had come on Wormser’s 
sociological expedition. Or was 
it the one before that? Snell wa$ 
also a citizen; they fell into into 
a pleasant chat about the City 
and its affairs. 

“By the way, I Hear you”re 
going on a trip,” said Snell. 

Wormser lazily lifted his apri- 
cot brandy. Delicious! He smack- 
ed his lips. “Yes. Going back to 
Saturn. Going back to report.” 

£1 



Snell looked uneasy. “Wormser 
— none of us ever Have, you 
know. THe thirty from the first 
expedition. The twenty on the 
second. The ten on the last. Not 
one.” 

“Well, you can’t blame the 
City. It has its rules. Once they 
let you in, it has its rules. A 
five-year novitiate. They can’t 
have people running in and out 
all of the time. The natives are 
bom here and die Here; they do 
not leave. So why should the 
City waste the energy-money to 
set up a come-and-go routine for 
sixty Earthmen or the other 
strays that come by occasional- 
ly?” 

“It’s best not to leave at all,” 
said Snell. “We talked about you 
at the last meeting of the Former 
Earthmen’s Club. Everybody was 
Happy to see you make citizen 
status. They’d be shocked if you 
left.” 

“Oh, I shall return, as they 
say.” 

Snell was apparently not made 
easy by the statement. “It would 
embarrass the Club if you left.” 

“Yes,” said Wormser. “Still, 
none of us gets through life with- 
out little embarrassments, evert 
in such a fine city as Reflex.” 

Snell stmck his palm, a lec- 
turer making a point to a student. 
“The whole point of Having a 
city is to make it a place that 
you would prefer to any other 
62 



place. Therefore to leave the 
city is to deny the city.” 
“Well, one man leaving the city 
in all eternity won’t make much 
difference, I expect,” said Worm- 
ser easily. He held up another 
finger and the light-sensitive, au- 
tomatic bartender yielded more 
delicious brandy. 

“It’s precedent,” said Snell. 
“Especially to one who wasn’t 
bom here,” Wormser said. 

'^He City is very proud that no 
-*■ one has ever left it, even the 
foreigners. For us it is much 
more important not to leave.” 

“I can see that,” nodded Worm- 
ser, cutting Happily into His sec- 
ond brandy. “THe ultimate City 
offering the ultimate scope of 
human affairs to any man would 
be down-graded to penultimate 
if anybody left. Even one man.” 
“Now you’ve got it!” said 
Snell. “For you to leave — this 
could destroy the City. Twenty 
million humrtn lives, including 
your former Earthman friends. 
Incidentally, the Club would like 
to ask you to be Vice-Chairman 
next term. You Have many ad- 
mirers in the Club.” 

“They don’t admire me as 
much as I do them,” said Worm- 
ser. “All fine fellows. When I get 
back from Saturn, I’d be glad to 
serve.” 

Snell protested: ‘Wormser, for 
God’s sake, why — ” 



GALAXY 



“Because tHe City isn’t one,” 
said Wormsefr “That’s all.” He 
paid and left. 

Wprmser sped down tfie endless 
levels of streets and walkways — 
ptirples, mauves, greens, yellows 
— ^meanings piled upon subtle 
meanings; one could study for a 
century and not learn all of tKe 
things that the City encompassed. 
He floated downwards in a two- 
place drifting machine that one 
used to reach the foundations, 
slipping pleasantly from level to 
level, much like a lazy paper 
airplane Wormser Had once shot 
out of the fourth floor of his col- 
lege dorm and watched fall gently. 

Now he was down to the apart- 
ments of the families. His own 
level was reserved for the young 
unmarried. 

Down here were all the wide 
parkways, schools, playgrounds, 
children’s vehicles. Women moved 
with their shouting children, kids 
raced, ran, fell, cried, laughed, 
shouted, as children have done 
since the world began. If one pre- 
ferred marriage, one could be 
happy here, thought Wormser, 
waving to a blond boy who might 
have been himself years back. If 
one did not prefer marriage, one 
was not forced. 

He saw an attractive red-head- 
ed wife and thought back to his 
own sexual experiences on coming 
to the City. It had been hard to 
get used to. The City rather pre- 
THE CITY THAT l,OVES YOU 



ferred that a novitiate not n^ect 
his private life. But it was too 
sophisticated to believe that it 
could thrust any girl inte Kis 
arms. 

Consequently, he met 
in usual and unusual ways; but 
when he was lonely, it was some- 
how never for long. Nor was there 
a need to make a spectacle ®f it. 
A direct look and a gesture from 
a man’s repertoire, a smile if 
accepted, an averted face if not. 
Just like back home. But the siffl-i 
ilarities ended there. Sometimes 
the girl was forward; sometimes 
the results were quick. At other 
times she was hard to reach, hard 
to convince. 

The one thing you could count 
on was that no two experiences 
were alike, but all relationslups 
ended successfully. Somehow, 
whether the girl was short or tail, 
cute or stately, quick or slow, she 
always revealed a compatibility. 
True, for Wormser, affairs never 
lasted long; they followed their 
sine wave — passion rose to a 
peak, diminished, and then one 
day he didn’t think about her any 
more. 

There was pleasure at the meet- 
ing, pain in the parting. Some- 
times your nose was put a little 
out of joint. But always under- 
neath was the sure knowledge 
that the pain of the old would be 
followed by the pleasure of the 
new.

H is speculations, pleasant and 
relaxing, had brought Him to 
the very floor of the plain of the 
planet upon wHicH the Huge City 
rested. Here, five years ago, the 
Saturn-based ship Had landed 
witK its crew, of wHicH Wormser 
was not the Head, but the third 
leader of the ten. Here also was 
tKe parking lot for the other 
Earth ships which Had brought 
earlier expeditions. And the ships 
from other worlds, .which Had 
likewise disgorged aliens who Had 
entered the City never to return. 

Wormser’s robots were busy 
preparing the small spacecraft 
for flight, as He had ordered them 
to do. As He watched the willing, 
skillful robots, man-like machines 
over ten feet tall, he wondered 
How often this ship Had been pre- 
pared for the flight to Saturn. 
Dozens, perhaps hundreds of 
times. And the other ships too. 
During the novitiate, all citizen- 
prospectives had come outside 
the City to prepare their ma- 
chines to leave many times. But 
none had ever left. Wormser put 
that knowledge out of his mind; 
he had no quarrel with the City. 
Out here, Wormser felt uncom- 
fortable. His all-purpose suit had 
ceased to function so far from the 
broadcast power sources. He felt 
sweaty; his limgs breathed pun- 
gent, unwashed air. There was a 
laziness, a chaotic mixture of 
things, dust, old tree branches, 
64 



dead grass mixed with living, the 
usual poor assortment of what 
men called nature and Had im- 
measurably improved upon in 
Reflex, ' 

A slatternly native approach- 
ed Bm. Wormser took out his 
small gun and waved it at her. 
There were nomadic tribes on the 
planet who did not belong to the 
City. They never Had and never 
would. Sub-human, they lived in 
tents and huts, ate raw meat, were 
ridden with disease and were 
slaves to quixotic mythologies. 
In the beginning, you came out 
to study the tribes. Free men liv- 
ing in a free nature. Reflex was 
glad to have you do tBs; you 
lost interest soon enough. They 
hated Citymen and would steal 
from them, -attack, subvert. They 
understood only the gun. Reflex 
did not deny them. There was a 
section of the City to which they 
could be admitted, but their no- 
vitiate was sixty or eighty years. 
They died before ever becoming 
citizens in a sort of semi-City lim- 
bo, Their children became use- 
ful citizens, but there was nothing 
to be done about these uncom- 
prehending animals that walked 
like men. 

The woman made gibbering 
speech soimds, offering Wormser 
a grin from a dirty face and dig- 
ging two round, sun-tanned 
breasts out of her animal-skin 
jacket. Her hips moved to sug- 

GALAXY 



gest sex. If He Hadn’t felt sorry 
for tHis basic, pleasing creature 
He migHt Have laughed. If one 
accommodated a forest maiden, 
one would find a knife in one’s 
back at some moment. 

Wormser waved Her off; sHe 
went at a wolf -lope. Her sKort at- 
tention span captured by a sight 
or a sound or smell beyond his 
senses, Having failed tKe fruits of 
his person and possession. 

During the encounter a moni- 
tor Had quietly driven up to 
Wormer’s ship. These were the 
police of the City. The delicate 
radar connected to tHe giant com- 
puter took care of most crime 
before it got started, reading dan- 
gerous thoughts, so the monitors 
were all that was required. 

“You are planning a space 
trip?” asked the man. 

“Yes. Going to Saturn,” said 
Wormser. 

The monitor looked worried. 
“I don’t believe that would be a 
good idea,” he said. 

“Perhaps not,” said Wormser. 
“Still, in a less than perfect uni-, 
verse one follows one’s ideas, 
good or bad.” 

The monitor nodded. Wormser 
was a full-fledged citizen and not 
to be treated carelessly. 

“You will have to appear be- 
fore the City Council, of course.” 

“It is required of a citizen?” 
said Wormser sharply, letting 
surprise show in his voice. The 
THE CITY THAT LOVES YOU 



man caught the nuance and 
blushed. 

“I mean — it is customary be- 
fore one does such a thing,” Ke 
said. 

“Naturally,” said Wormser., 
The man relaxed; he went to Sis 
craft and dialed the computer. 
His little task was done. He 
drove politely behind Wormser 
as the Earthman regained his city 
sailer and headed back into Re- 
flex. 

Tt did not seem to Wormser that 
-*• the City Council met very 
often from the way they shifted 
in their chairs and stared about 
their chamber as if it were almost 
as unfamiliar to them as to Kttw 
There was a moment of laughabte 
confusion when it became obvi- 
ous that none of the seven men 
were quite sure which was the 
Mayor and was to Have the b%, 
white leather chair in the center 
of the table, but one of the num- 
ber was eventually thrust for- 
ward. He now faced Wormser, 
who sat in a sort of witness box 
facing the seven on a very com- 
fortable, dark leather chair. 

You wish to leave the City, 
citizen?” asked the Mayor. He 
looked disappointed. 

“Yes. For a short time. I be- 
lieve there is no law against it.” 

“There are no laws at all os 
Reflex, as you well know,” said 
the Mayor testily. “Only the 

65 



semi-civilized Have laws. TEey 
merely serve as a point of end- 
less dispute and challenge to ac- 
tivate man’s Kostilily.” 

“Tfie Computer ranks you 
KigH as a citizen,” said a white- 
haired man down at tfie end. 

Tfie computer rested beneatfi 
tfie City. It took care of ninety 
per cent of tfie needs and ran tfie 
macEines tfiat made everything 
fit togetfier so comfortably. It 
was a slave to the people, but 
well respected. 

“I Have a fiigfi regard for tfie 
computer,” said Wormser. “In 
my former world, machines were 
distrusted. My own tfiougfit is 
tfiaf macfiines embody tfie perfec- 
tions meu cannot build in them- 
selves and are useful extensions 
of man’s finer drives.” 

They all nodded solemnly. The 
eight men in tfie room felt com- 
fortable and useful and close to 
one another. Wormser liked that. 

“However,” said Wormser. 
“The City is less than one.” 

Tfie feeling of good fellowship 
seemed to dissolve. Tfie Mayor 
shifted imeasily. Tfie six others 
reacted in various ways — star- 
tled, imbelieving, amused. But 
they all reacted. 

“I fail to see your point.” 

“If you cannot see my point,” 
said Wormser, “you cannot un- 
derstand why I want to go to 
Saturn for a while.” 

One of the men got up and 

66 



dialed the computer from a tele- 
phone switchboard. “Tfie machine 
will probably call your statement 
nonsense,” fie said. “Tfie machine 
is programmed to Handle non- 
sense statements — tfiey fiave 
been tried many times.” 

“Tfie machine will understand,” 
said Wormser. “Itself, it operates 
on a range between minus one 
and plus one. Deatfi is one. Tfie 
time before birth is one. But life 
is always less than one.” 
“You’ve Heard the citizen’s 
statements,” said the Mayor. 
“How do you vote?” 

Tfie City Council voted against 
Wormser leaving Reflex. “You 
understand,” tfie Mayor said, “we 
fiave nothing against leaving. We 
are merely advising you of our 
opinion, seven good citizens to 
one good citizen.” 

“Tfiese differences of opinion 
do arise,” said Wormser affably. 
“You reject our advice?” 

“OH, yes,” said Wormser. “I 
must reject your adduce. I plan 
to go to Saturn.” 

Tfie Coimcil stood up. We are 
going to program a vote of all of 
tfie twenty million people of tfie 
city on this trip tonight,” said 
the Mayor. “This will occur at 
dinner time when everyone is 
home. How do you think you? 
twenty million fellow citizens 
will react?” 

“I expect they will vote against 
me.” 



GALAXY 



The Mayor nodded. “All ex- 
cept the small nuisance vote. Ev- 
ery human society has its nega- 
tive people. How will you react 
then when both the officers of 
your city and the people them- 
selves advise you against leav- 
ing?” 

“I couldn’t say,” said Worm- 
ser. “It isn’t even liuichtime, but 
the vote doesn’t take place vuitil 
tonight.” 

T hey called Him at the apart- 
ment at about eight o’clock 
that night. It was the Mayor 
himself to tell him that the din- 
ner-time vote had gone against 
him with ninety-nine per cent 
taking that position, one half 
voting for him, and one half per 
cent declining any opinion. 

“And one not voting,” said 
Wormser. “The computer is very 
accurate. It deleted the question 
on my dinner-time vote display 
out of a sensitivity to my posi- 
tion. I appreciate that.” 

“You will give up the project?” 
asked the Mayor. 

“No,” said Wormser. “But you 
must thank the citizens for hav- 
ing shown enough interest to par- 
ticipate in the vote on my proj- 
ect.” 

The Mayor was silent, staring 
at Wormser on the television 
plate. The old man pulled at his 
lip. “Yoru statement about your 
reasons has gone to the com- 
THE CITY THAT LOVES YOU 



puter,” he said, in a voice with 
the echo of a threat. It is in the 
Hands of tfie machine now. The 
ynarhin e imderstands ethical 
logic, but it Has no emotions.” 
“How will it react?” 

“One of three ways,” said iHe 
Mayor. “It will remain silent, 
showing that it has no opinion. 
Or it will agree with your reason 
and that would be a miracle, be- 
cause this matter Has come up 
a hundred thousand times before 
with other citizens. Always it has 
disagreed, destroyed their logic. 
Or it will find you emotionally 
disturbed, in which case it will 
insist on corrective therapy rath- 
er than your trip. In the parlance 
of your former tradition, the ma- 
chine is our Supreme Court.” 
Wormser thanked him and 
hung up. At ten o’clock the com- 
puter itself called, and its inter- 
rogative voice asked him for fur- 
ther information on his less-than- 
one statement. With lights going 
off and the City retiring, it had 
many circuits available to work 
on the problem. Wormser sat at 
his keyboard and t5rped for over 
an hour, setting forth his argu- 
ment from every position. Then 
he took a chilled glass of pink 
wine and fell into a deep, restful 
sleep. 

T he overnight poll Had made 
Wormser a temporary celeb- 
rity — not a large one, just an 

67 



average one. There were about 
one hundred thousand citizens 
out to watch Him depart, or at- 
tempt to depart, on his trip on 
the following morning. 

They clustered along the foun- 
dation road that led out of the 
City, bunched on the open fields 
and covered the area where the 
spaceships rested, leaving a po- 
lite circle around his own vehicle. 
A helio platform bore a newspa- 
perman, the glassy eye of the 
television pointing on him. The 
City Council were all present, 
standing high' above the crowd 
on a ter porary platform. Small 
children played about the feet of 
their parents; hawkers sold drinks 
and ice cream; it was definitely 
an event of some interest. Along 
one edge of the crowd were the 
members of Former Earthmen, 
their banner raised over their 
heads and a large placard which 
read: 

“NO, WORMSER, NO!” 

Wormser felt very much like a 
political candidate who faces an 
unenthusiastic audience. When He* 
appeared, there was a scattering 
of applause and a few faint 
cheers. These were balanced by 
some jeers and boos. But most of 
the audience stared at him sul- 
lenly, interested but removed, 
curious, as if he were a strange 
beast beyond knowing. No one 
had ever left the City in record- 
ed history. The City had driven 
<58 



out a few — a very few — but 
this was the voluntary act of a 
full-fledged valuable citizen, man 
with a good work record, pleas- 
ant personality, a community as- 
set, as important as every other 
one. If one could believe, what 
would be the effect on those less 
willing to brave popular opinion 
but nevertheless curious? 

The most disheartening sight 
was the full-fledged soldier stand- 
ing next to the Mayor. He held 
a sub-machine gun at ready. The 
sun made the purposeful weapon 
glitter with real and shocking se- 
riousness. 

Wormser knew that the City 
kept one full-fledged soldier on 
its pasrroll, fully equipped, but 
he had never though to meet the 
man. From the way the man 
moved, checking his gun, shuf- 
fling his feet as if getting ready 
to use it, Wormser felt at last 
the hard edge of reality. 

The newsmen caught up with 
him at the side of his ship, invit- 
ing him on the platform. “Will 
you say a few words about your 
project. Citizen?” 

Wormser stepped up on the 
platform, aware of the new sweat 
beginning. “If I had known so 
many were interested, I wouldn’t 
have promised to bring back Sat- 
urn souvenirs,” he said. The thin 
joke brought forth no laughter. 
His voice howled and echoed off 
the walls of the city behind him. 

GALAXY 



“I am going to Saturn,” he went 
on. “I was sent from Saturn to 
study the City and report back 
on it I’ve lived and worked Ectc 
five years. I love the City. I shall 
return when my report to Earth 
officials on Saturn is finished. 
Don’t let anything happen to the 
City while I’m gone.” 

H e felt light-headed at this 
point. The question was 
whether they’d let him enter his 
vehicle. Once inside, the sub-ma- 
chine gvm could do no harm, al- 
though he supposed they had 
rockets to shoot him down in 
space. But the sky looked blue, 
sunny and friendly, and there 
were no ships aloft. There were 
no rocket launchers that he coxild 

see just the uniformed soldier 

with the gun. The man now step- 
ped forward and the City Coun- 
cil and the Mayor fell back in a 
polite circle against the executing 
blast of the gim. The white-haired 
fellow whom Wormser remember- 
ed from yesterday made a point 
of stuffing cotton in his ears. 

The Mayor had his own bull- 
horn. “Wormser, I beseech you 
to abandon your project. It is not 
popular with your officials or the 
majority of the citizens.” 

Wormser still had the PA mike 
from the newsmen. He still stood 
on the platform. “Men make de- 
cisions that are sometimes not 
popular,” he said. “Men seek 
THE CITY THAT LOVES YOU 



attonement, harmony. Men seek 
one-ness. A place like Reflex 
comes close to unity, to provid- 
ing each small and large thing 
that satisfies a man. But to me, 
unity is not quite reached on 
Reflex, or an3Avhere else. Unity 
may turn out to be the time be- 
fore birth and the time after 
death. But for me there is still 
a small gap. So I search. I am 
sorry to upset you all.” 

There was a painful silence 
now as he put down the micro- 
phone. The silence was broken 
by several yells and calls for 
the last restraint. “The comput- 
er!” called many. 

The computer would reject his 
argiunent, and he would be shot if 
he were found sane but destruc- 
tive in his act. The computer 
would reject his argiunent, and 
he would be sent to a hospital if 
he were found insane. His only 
hope was that the computer had 
made or would make no state- 
ment at all. 

Wormser felt that he walked 
on cotton; his legs were not his 
as he moved down to the ground 
and walked to his entrance ramp. 
The sound of the sub-machine 
gun being cleared and the maga- 
zine slamming home made him 
jump; his neck tingled and his 
back cringed. 

He remembered the call from 
Saturn early this morning. “Don’t 
come back,” Butler Had said. 

69 



“Stay in Reflex. We can con- 
tinue to get reports by communi- 
cations as we Have before.” 
“Snell Has called you.” 

“Snell and a few otKers,” said 
Butler. “If you try to leave, it 
seems certain tKat you will lose 
your life. It will probably also 
result in a break in diplomatic 
relations for us. MucH better to 
stay tKere and see if a few more 
years won’t cKange things.” 
You’ve never debriefed a City 
man in person back on Saturn.” 
Butler sighed. “I don’t expect 
to in my lifetime. You stay there.” 

■^Tow his hand on the door Han- 
die. It trembled. He turned; 
he saw the soldier and saw the 
small hole of the sub-machine 
gun barrel pointing at him. His 
heart gave a jirnip, his breath felt 
hot and cold in his lungs. The 
crowd was extremely silent His 
unamplified voice was heard. 

“There is no law,” he said. 
“The machine has remained si- 
lent. Good-bye.” 

He started in. He heard the 
shocking clatter of the sub-ma- 
chine gun. 

Then inexplicably, despite the 
ear-smashing roar of the gun, he 
was inside the ship. He closed the 
door; he walked up to the pilot 
compartment, nodded to his ro- 
bot assistant and punched the 
START buttons with sweating 
hands. He expected to feel the 
70 



pain of the bullets in his back — 
But outside the ship, the sol- 
dier had stepped back to parade 
rest, holding the grin aloft. The 
platform around the soldier’s 
feet was sprinkled witli spent 
shell casings. The Mayor and the 
City Council smiled and waved. 
Most of the crowd moved back 
now, waving, breaking-up. 

The sky blackened as he reach- 
ed deep space. There was no sign 
of pursuit by ship or rocket. 

“Reflex. City Computer call- 
ing.” 

“Wormser,” said Wormser into 
the mike, thinking that the ma- 
chine sounded almost human in 
radio commxmication where all 
men sounded like machines 
through space static. “That sub- 
machine gun of the soldier’s,” 
he went on in a compulsive rush 
of words. “Those were blanks.” 
“Of course,” said the City 
Computer. “The soldier had to 
be convinced you were not stunt- 
ing for attention. ” 

“Thank you.” 

“You are two degrees off course 
for Saturn,” said the machine. 
“You’ll miss a bit if you don’t 
correct.” 

He broke off, corrected his course 
and sat there traveling in space, 
feeling good, relieved and then 
sad, eventually. He hoped they 
wouldn’t hold him too long on 
Saturn. He missed the City al- 
ready. —RAY BANKS

LEVIATHAN 

by LISE BRAUN 



They rescued him from o wofery 
fjeafh — and gave him immorfalify I 



T fie submarine Leviathus put 
to sea from Her Some port 
of Abrowfyn on a wami arid Eu- 
mid spring ffioming. TEe air was 
damp and tEe sun Eadn’t foil- 
ed up tEe low fog tEat still Eung 
over tEe docks and swirled in off 
tEe water. TEe gray mist muf- 
fled tEe noises made^ by the 
sEip’s crew and by tEe sailors 
standing by on tEe pier, waiting 
for tEe order to cast off. 

It took an Eour to cEeck out 
all operations before Eer cap- 
tdin gave tEe order to submerge. 
TEe signals sounded, ffie EatcE- 
es clanged sEut and .the air sys- 
tems started to work, displacing 
tfie salt smell of tEe sea air witE 
clean odorless, filtered air. And 



Leviatfais began Eer descent, tEe 
water foaming over Eer bow and 
then cEuming up white over tEe 
rapidly disappear^ conning 
tower. 

Her captain. Commander 
Llanwyh, was a gray-Eaired vet-, 
eran of tEe submarine service* 
He’d lost count of tfie number of 
dives Ee Ead made but since he’d 
taken command of tEe LeviathuSf 
submerging unnerved Him. If 
Had been different witE tEe older 
craft. Tfien you only knew you 
were going imder when you saw, 
it on tEe instrument panel. 

But lEe new ^ps of tEe 
FourtE Submaririe Fleet Ead 
transparent bows — from tfie 
midslups deck clear up to tfie 



gunwales you could see out. And 
as the waters started rising up, 
cKanging the light inside, it dis- 
turbed him and he tried to shake 
morbid thoughts of being buried 
alive. 

Once they submerged and 
were moving through the water, 
he had to admit it was beautiful; 
but never could bring himself 
to say it was worth the price. 
Custom required him to stay for- 
ward, and his emotions were not 
to be taken into any considera- 
tion. 

The descent was thankfully 
over with quickly; then the sub 
was moving swiftly through the 
green water, dropping down fur- 
ther, her ruiuiing lights piercing 
the sani-darkness, now lighting 
up the fascinating world under 
the Atlantic Ocean. 

Leviathus was the fifth and 
latest sub of the Fourth Fleet to 
use the new solar reactors; the 
submarine engines were the first 
peaceful use made of the im- 
mense power plants and the subs 
could stay submerged months 
longer than conventional craft. 

On her last trip, Leviathus had 
taken a party of geologists 
through the volcanic islands to 
the west of the continental shelf 
past the game preserve islands, 
then southward toward the coast 
of Lemuria to observe the vol- 
canic activity in the Western 
Ocean which Had been threaten- 

72 



ing the western coasts for the 
past two years. She was, at pres- 
ent, cruising toward the Soutli 
Atlantic with a party of marine 
scientists and biologists aboard. 

The cruise had been unevent- 
ful for over a week. The scien- 
tists had donned underwater 
gear and taken samples of the 
life and sediment on the bottom 
and were now in the process of 
sorting and evaluating their 
finds. They would be going out 
again when the ship reached the 
islands further to the east in the 
Mid-Atlantic. 

The inhabitants here were ex- 
tremely warlike and only slight- 
ly removed from the scattered 
tribes of savages, isolated by the 
last geological upheaval from 
those who the historians know 
were their forebears. 

There would be no need for 
concern as long as the ship re- 
mained submerged. Several ex- 
peditions, in past years, had not 
returned. The government now 
felt that a policy of non-inter- 
ference was best vmtil the na- 
tives became more civilized and 
reasonable diplomatic relations 
could one day be established. 

The navigator was laying in 
the course that would send the 
sub toward the Mid- Islands, 
when the sonar officer interrupt- 
ed Llanwylfs thoughts to an- 
nounce another presence coming 
up fast off the starboard bow. He 

GALAXY 



entered the sonar compartment 
to observe. 

I t soon became obvious tfiat 
the intruder was no conven- 
tional ship. They had received no 
reply to their signals, and He re- 
alized they wouldn’t. It was an 
iceberg, moving through the wa- 
ter apparently borne by the im- 
dercurrents at an incredible rate 
of speed. More and more of the 
icy intruders were making their 
way into the warmer waters. This 
one should have melted by now, 
but the undercurrent it was rid- 
ing on must have moved it too 
rapidly from its northern moor- 
ing. 

He gave orders for evasive ac- 
tion and the ship swung to port 
only to discover through her in- 
struments that the mass was too 
big to get aroimd. That damn 
berg must have been fifty miles 
long, and they could get neither 
to the left nor to the right of it. 
By the time the reactors had 
built up sufficient power to en- 
able the Leviathus to outnm her 
pursuer, the berg caught up with 
the submarine. 

With the possibility of a col- 
lision uppermost in his mind and 
in an effort to keep ahead of and 
get around the berg. Command- 
er Llanwylf had given orders to 
run obliquely to it. The berg 
rammed the sub to starboard and 
bounced her away, then kept on, 
LEVIATHAN 



pushed bx the current, unaware, 
unfeeling, oblivious to the dam- 
age it had just caused. 

Llanwylf remembered sailing 
years ago, on ships that had not 
been equipped with sonar, and 
was grateful for one more mod- 
ern invention. At least there had 
been a warning, time to rig for 
collision. 

As the Damage Control crews 
began reporting back, it seemed 
there was little serious damage. 
Water was entering several rear 
starboard compartments, a re- 
sult of the outer plates buckling, 
but they were quickly sealed off. 
As they were only for stowage, 
it seemed that Leviathus would 
be able to continue on course, 
repairs being effected without ur- 
gency. 

Until his chief engineer point- 
ed to his air gauges. The safety 
level of pure air was dropping 
— only a few hours of clean air 
left. Repair crews rushed to 
pump out the compartments, but 
there wasn’t going to be enough 
time. 

It would spoil their record, 
of course, but damn it all, their 
lives happened to be more impor- 
tant than what He wrote into the 
log. Llanwylf gave the order to 
surface. 

(t^aptain, there’s a craft drift- 
^ ing out there, with someone 
in it” The crewman pointed, and 

73 



Llanwylf took the glasses to look. 
An unkempt, swarthy man with 
long black hair was leaning 
weakly against the side of the 
small, crude rowboat. The cap- 
tain called for medics and for 
crewmen to gaff the boat. 

They pulled it close, then went 
down into the water to help the 
man out. The touch of their 
helping hands on his raw, sun- 
bimied skin was agonizing, but 
somehow he knew they meant to 
help and tried to pull himself 
up. 

The medics helped the stran- 
ger toward the hatch but it was 
impossible for him to walk. They 
slung a stretcher down — as 
they had tried to lift him, he 
cried out in pain — then took 
the stretcher to sickbay. There 
one of the medics put something 
against his arm that stung and 
he fell asleep directly, after won- 
dering why they Had done that. 

Doctor Marwyl presented him- 
self to the captain after the stran- 
ger had been tended to and in- 
formed him that the man had 
eaten and was now sleeping nor- 
mally. 

“Repairs will be finished 
shortly. Doctor, and we’ll be sub- 
merging. What are we supposed 
to do with him?” 

“He’ll need rest for the next 
two or three days,” replied Mar- 
wyl. “We’re certainly not going 
to set him out in that boat.” 

74 



“No,” said Llanwylf, “but 
once we’re back under, we’re def- 
initely not coming up until the sci- 
entists are finished. We’ve wast- 
ed enough time already. Besides, 
where are we supposed to let him 
out? I don’t suppose you can un- 
derstand him?” 

“If we could, I doubt that he 
knows enough to point out on a 
'chart where he comes from. But 
from the few words he’s spoken, 
I’ve a feeling that our languages 
are similar.” 

“Well, doctor, he’s your pa- 
tient and your responsibility 
now. He’ll have to stay with us, 
but keep him out of the way.” 

The stranger turned out to be 
one of the inhabitants of the 
Mid-Islands and more intelligent 
than supposed. The doctor and 
he were soon able to pick up 
enough of each other’s language, 
as they were similar, a fact which 
caused Marwyl to wonder about 
their common ancestors. 

Marwyl was on the bridge, in 
conversation with his captain. 
“Seems our friend discovered 
caviar. His people aren’t allow- 
ed to row those little boats out 
too far. The deity they believe 
in apparently doesn’t want them 
to, and they themselves are scar- 
ed stiff of sea-monsters. Anyway, 
he went out farther than he’s 
supposed to. He doesn’t seem to 
have set much store in this god. 
And he had discovered what the 

GALAXY 



insides of sturgeon taste like. 

“Well, lie went out past tlie 
otKers, and wfiile fie was basking 
in the sun a storm blew up. The 
rest is obvious. Except for tfie 
fact that tfie four days fie spent 
out there seem to fiave convinced 
him that a supreme being prob- 
ably does exist — especially 
since we came along and rescued 
him. 

“You know besides this almost 
sophisticated viewpoint on reli- 
gion, his people are living in 
towns now. They’ve been out of 
caves for enough generations for 
him to fiave no knowledge of 
that kind of life.” 

T fie land fie fiad come from 
was dominated by a fiuge, 
flat-topped, bare stone cliff tfiat 
rose up from tfie center of the 
peninsula. When fie was shown 
topographic pfioto-maps fie was 
easily able to point it out. 
Months later, wfien tfie expedi- 
tion’s studies were completed, 
tfie Leviaihus made Ker way 
back toward the Mid-Islands. 

His town was set on tfie inside 
of the elbow of land and tfie 
sub surfaced on tfie outer sea- 
edge of this shook, where they 
would not be seen. A small boat 
was put down, and he was rowed 
to shore. 

“You know, he really was a 
likeable cfiap after we fixed him 
up}” said Marwyl. 

LEVIATHAN 



“Interesting what orthodontia 
can do for someone’s appear- 
ance,” said tfie captain, referring 
to tfie fact tfiat they fiad repair- 
ed and cleaned his broken discol- 
ored teeth, then went on, “I 
ttiink we’ve managed to learn 
enough about the growth of his 
people’s civilization to send field 
crews out there soon.” 

The boat came back; Llan- 
wylf made his way to the bridge 
to observe the waters engulfing 
his ship, and Leviaihus sub- 
merged again to make her way 
back to Atlantis. 

It took him the rest of tfie day 
to make his way along tfie beach 
and aroimd the spit of land; he 
fiad grown soft from the months 
aboard the ship. When his peo- 
ple saw him come walking wear- 
ily toward the center of the 
town, they rejoiced. 

“Our God has saved you,” said 
the elders. 

“Yes,” he said simply, “yes. 
He has.” 

Where fiad fie been, they want- 
ed to know. And wfiat fiad hap- 
pened. 

He told them of his four days 
adrift after tfie storm, and of 
the rescue by tfie enormous ship 
that fiad risen up out of the wa- 
ter; then fie explained fiow the 
sfiip fiad traveled all these months 
back under tfie water. 

A sfiip indeed, tfiey said. It 
was quite impossible. Tfiey beg- 

75 



ged him to be truthful. He spent 
a long time trjdng to convince 
them. He smiled, to show that 
his eroded and blackened teeth 
were now even white. 

Oixr God has done this to wel- 
come you back to Him, they said. 
He tried to describe the ship, 
scratching the long ellipse in the 
dust, telling them of the trans- 
parent bow and the lights that 
showed them their way under- 
water. 

The elders conferred. “We 



have decided that you have been 
deluded in your shock. This giant 
ship must indeed have been a 
sea monster, probably a giant 
whale. But we shall give thanks 
in the morning for your deliver- 
ance.” 

“I know that our God did save 
me; but you cannot tell me that 
the ship was a whale. I know it 
was a ship,” insisted the man 
they called Jonah.

FORECAST 

As you'll see elsewhere in this issue, the man who carried away 
all the marbles in Galax/s $1000 Award for the best story published 
in Galaxy or If for 1968 is Cliff Simak. Winning awards is no surprise 
to Mr. Simak; he's had them before (most recently a Hugo for Way Station. 
which appeared in Galaxy a few years ago as Here Gather the Stars) and, 
chances are, he II have them ogam. He's been producing top-rated science 
fiction for about a third of a century now, and the end is far from in sight. 

Next month, for instance, we have his newest novelette. It's called 
Buckets of Diamonds. Will you like it? Well, when was the last time you 
read a Simak story you didn't like? 

In the same issue there's a hefty long novelette by another long-time 
favorite, James E. Gunn. Last month in If we published his Trial by Fire, 
a story of a future Earth where science has become the embodiment of 
evil, and true believers fear it as good churchmen once feared the devil. 
Next month in Galaxy he continues the same theme to its logical — but 
not obvious — conclusion, in Witch Hunt. 

Robert Bloch will be with us with a story; Willy Ley and Algis Budrys 
will, return with their usual informed brilliance. And there'll be more, but 
how much more we won't know until we see how the type sets 

And one thing more. The issue after next we're starting a new serial. It's 
by Frank Herbert, and it's called Dune Messiah. It's recommended.

The Weather 
On Welladay 

by ANNE McCaffrey 

illustrated by REESE 



Welladay was a watery world, known 
through the galaxy for the violence of 
its weather — and of its inhabitants! 



I 

W elladay was indeed a watery 
world, Shahanna thought 
as the day side of the planet turn- 
ed under her ship. Good thing 
that explorers were obstinate 



/ 

creatures or the hidden riches of 
this sopping, stormy world would 
have gone uimoticed. 

She checked visually; as the 
ship’s computer began to print 
landing advice. 

“I’m not that stupid,” mV£-' 



77 



mxired, appreciating the turbu- 
lence of several storm centers that 
blossomed in the northern Hemis- 
phere of Welladay. She tapped 
out “locate” for the Rib Reefs, 
the rocky spine of the planet 
which stretched from north to 
south and broadened at “shoul- 
der” height into the Blade, the 
one permanent installation on the 
watery world. “At sunrise, hmm? 
Wouldn’t you know? And right in 
the path of one storm. Well, let’s 
beat it in,” and she began to 
punch out landing coordinates. 

At that moment, the proximity 
alarm rang. She hit the “enlarge” 
toggle of the screen control just 
in time to see the telltale blips — 
the small satellite that ought not 
to be in Welladan skies. Then her 
ship rocked with the violence of 
a direct hit. Shahanna stayed 
conscious long enough to press 
the arm-rest survival button, be- 
fore she blacked out in a parox- 
ysm of shock and fury and pain. 

/^dis planted his flippered foot 
on the whalelet’s blimt snout 
and shoved. 

“This is no time for nuzzling, 
nuisance,” he roared, as the force 
of his thrust sent the baby back- 
finning. Whales like to be talked 
to — roared at — though there 
was small chance they imderstood 
more than the tone of voice. Some 
fistunen denied that much com- 
prehension. “Ahnost through now, 
78 



mother,” Odis bellowed reassur- 
ingly at the massive creature 
whose thyroid glands he was tap- 
ping. 

The dial on the long-beaked 
suction pump reached the red 
and, with more deftness than 
others gave him credit for, Odis 
broke the connection and sealed 
the beak. He closed the tap 
mouth and noted the date of this 
tap with paint-pen above the 
metal-insert. Old tap-dates had 
faded but the new paint would 
glow for the three months it took 
a mature whale to generate more 
vital radioactive iodine in itsj 
thyroid gland. 

Odis touched the zoom button 
on the drone remote control, 
scrawling the whale’s registry 
number on the beaker before he 
held it beside the luminous date 
for the drone to record. That for- 
mality observed, he scratched the 
female’s rubbery upper lip where 
the scales were torn. What kinH 
of a fight had she been in? Well, 
the woxmd was healed. 

Again her child tried to nose 
Odis’s fishboat out of the way. 
Chuckling over its antics, Odis 
climbed up the boat’s ventral fin, 
over the back to the hatch. Duck- 
ing below, he stored the precious 
beak of radioactive iodine in the 
chemfoam-protected carrier. 

Back on the fishboat’s snub- 
nosed brow, Odis frowned at the 
sight of the school of whales be- 

GALAXY 



ginning to melt away from the 
neighborhood. He’d been out 
since early morning, tracking 
them down. He’d spent on Hour 
easing into the herd, before Ke 
had tried to tap one. He’d pound- 
ed affectionately on the snouts 
of the mammals he knew as well 
by scar marks as registration 
code. Two shied away from him 
BO wildly that he had begun to 
worry if this group had already 
been milked by that fardling pi- 
rate. When he had finally got 
alongside the old blue^carred 
cow and done a light top, he’d 
decided that their weather-sense 
was all that was making them 
skittish. 

Between the freakish storms 
of Welladay, Odis growled to 
himself, squinting towards the 
darkening horizon, and fardling 
pirates, they might as well pull 
the plug on operations here. He 
frowned. Where else would fie 
find a world more to his liking? 
A task more suited to him, a man 
bom and bred on a higfi-gravity 
planet? Or, and Odis snorted, 
creatures big enough not to suffer 
from his inordinate strength. 

He stepped on the release for 
the the outboard panel and be- 
gan to beam towards Shoulder 
Blade for a weather report. 

^"T^he Christmas-tree of instra- 
-*■ mentation lit up with vari- 
ous local indications of the weatfi- 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



er. But when he tried to reach 
Okker in his harbormaster’s 
lookout at the Eye of the Lagoon, 
the beam crackled' with interfer- 
ence. So the easterly storm had 
hit them. Even with a band of 
weather satellites, you couldn’t 
always be sure of weather on 
Welladay. 

Odis tagged tfie playback in case 
Okker had broadcast while he 
was tapping the whale. He whis- 
tled as he listened to Okker’s sour 
report of macfi-storm warnings, 
the advice that all vessels re- 
turn to Shoulder at cruising depth 
and held at shelf-depth vmtil re- 
call: the local storm over Shoul- 
der was only a squall. 

The warning was repeated 
twice with additional ominous 
details on the macfi-storm’s wind 
velocity, estimated drift and du- 
ration. 

Odis grunted. He could just im- 
agine Okker’s disgust at issuing 
such a message. Tallav, the mag- 
goty Planetary Administrator, 
had probably been at Okker’s el- 
bow. With the exercise of toler- 
ance, Odis could imderstand Tal- 
lav’s ineffectuality. A meek man, 
not suited to a blustery, stormy 
world like Welladay, even if af- 
fairs proceeded normally. Now 
Tallav was caught in a fladding 
bind: someone was pirating the 
main source of Welladan wealth 
so that no substantial revenue 
Had been garnered from the 

79 



whales in months. Result: sup- 
plies could' not be paid for; credit 
had been suspended; and witli 
the depredations of both pirate 
and natural catastrophes, only 
three fishboats were operable. Re- 
quests from legitimate sources for 
the priceless radioactive iodine 
had accelerated to demands: Ur- 
gent! Top PiioTtty. Gray phage 
was endemic and periodically epi- 
demic; the only specific vaccine 
was a dilute suspension of the ra. 
Short of tapping to death the 
few whales they could now find, 
Welladan fishmen were also con- 
stricted bj' lack of operable craft. 

The two best fishmen, Odis and 
Murv, a newcomer on a Debt- 
Contract, had been sMit out in 
an attempt to find and tap enough 
r.i. to pay for at least one critically 
needed cargo. Whatever Odis and 
Murv could get today was crucial. 
Odis wished they could charge a 
hardship premium but the price 
of r.i. had been fixed by Federa- 
tion who evidently were too con- 
cerned with other galactically 
shattering crises to pay atten- 
tion to repeated Welladan re- 
quests for investigation. 

And here was timid Tallav, 
calling the fishmen back because 
there was a mach-storm brewing 
in the west. Odis ran a quick 
check of the christmas-tree in- 
strumentation on the approaching 
storm, now boiling black an 4 
ochre on the horizon. 

80 



s he appraised the readings, 
he maneuvered his ship to- 
wards the nearest adult. He could 
get one more tap completed be- 
fore he d have to duck and run 
home. Fishboats were sturdily de- 
signed for Welladan waters, to 
race with the scaly spawn of her 
seas on hydrofoils, to plunge 
trenchward with the whales, to 
endure the savagery of a sudd«i 
squall, to wallow, whale-Iike, 
within the school itself and not 
be attacked by a nervous male. 
He coasted along the port side 
of the manunal, rather pleased 
that the creature was not sh3dng 
off like its schoolmates. The 
painted code above the tap-vent 
had faded completely. Odis toyed 
with the notion of perhaps a 
beak and a half of r.i. as he made 
his preparations to tap. 

It was then that he noticed the 
bad color of the scales. At first 
he thought it was the light. The 
sky was already changing with 
the approach of the storm. As 
he looked around, there wasn’t 
another whale in sight; thes^’d all 
raced away, north and south, to 
drive deep from the storm cen- 
ter. This whale wasn’t moving 
because it was close to death. 

Cursing with frustrated anger, 
Odis stomped below, retrieved 
the beak he had just drawn and 
prepared to pump it into the 
sick animal. Would it be enough? 
Was the gesture a waste of fluid 

GALAXY 



now, as precious to the life of 
Welladay as to this mammars? 
Odis refused to consider it a 
waste. In an angry scrawl he 
painted date and circumstance 
on the whale, underscoring the 
notation with a skull and cross- 
bones as broad as he could make 
it. 

He stepped back then, clench- 
ing his teeth against the brutal 
wastefulness of the pirate, won- 
dering bitterly how many more of 
the now vanished beasts had been 
tapped dry : how many more 
corpses would roll, black and 
bloated, on the fresh tides after 
the storm? 

He waited, hoping for some 
sign of change in the creature. 
There was no way of knowing 
how long ago the tap had occur- 
red: hours, days? Or how swift- 
ly the infusion would correct the 
deficiency. 

The wind freshened now; the 
outboard panel chattered metal- 
lically, then began to crackle with 
an authoritative noise. A craft 
approaching? Odis scanned the 
clouds. Suddenly a second drone 
broke into view, higher and north 
of his. He glanced down at the 
sea-viewer, waiting for the indi- 
cation that another fishboat ap- 
proached. The drone whistled 
overhead and the sea viewer re- 
mained tale-less. 

Murv was the only other fish- 
man out! Where was he that he’d 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



send his drone back alone? Had 
he been caught by mach-violence? 
A wilder shriek tore the air; the 
whale reacted with nervous bob- 
bing, pulling away from the fish- 
boat. 

Odis swung the christmas-tree, 
got a fix on the sound and follow- 
ed it, high up but lancing down- 
ward, downward, right into the 
mach-storm. He flipped the track 
toggle, keeping the outboard pan- 
el lined up with the visual trace 
of the intruder until the space- 
ship faded and disappeared into 
the clouds. 

T hat boiling trail had come 
from nothing based on Wel- 
laday. And it was heading away 
from the only settlement on the 
water world. Odis retracted the 
outboard panel. As he clambered 
down the ladder, he shot a final 
look at the whale, now moving 
slowly in a northerly direction. 
No, the r.i. had not been a waste. 
If the creature could just make 
it out of the storm’s path, feed 
himself up on plankton in the 
northern waters. 

Odis slammed the hatch down 
and reached the pilot’s couch just 
as the computer printed out the 
intruder’s course : straight into 
the storm, directly in line with 
the only other permanent land- 
fall, Crown Lagoon. The realiza- 
tion was particularly bitter to 
Odis, for it was the direction 

81 



from which Mcuw’s drone had 
just come. 

Slowly Odis tapped out a new 
course for the fishboat. Not back 
to the safety of Shoulder Blade, 
but straight into the storm, di- 
rectly on the intruder’s tail. XHen 
he fed into the computer the de- 
tails that Okker had transmitted 
on the mach-storm. As the print- 
out chattered, Odis sank back in- 
to the padded couch, his sxispi- 
cions confirn ed. 

In approximately five hours, 
the eve of the mach-storm would 
be centered over the gigantic old 
volcano whose drowned mouth 
formed a twenty-kilo -wide lagoon, 
the shards and lava plateaus of 
its slopes like a galactic-size 
crown, thrown down just above 
the equator of Welladay, in the 
shallow meadows of the western 
seas. 

Murv could lie in the deep be- 
yond the island’s shores, safe 
enough even with a mach-storm 
lashing deep into the ocean, un- 
til the eye of the storm covered 
Crown. Murv could surface then, 
deliver the stolen r.i. to the ship 
which had sneaked in under cov- 
er of the storms. Well, Mxurv 
would do well to leave with that 
pirate. 

Once the Investigator got 
here — perhaps before the plan- 
et was registered as Bankrupt 
and taken over by Federation — 
Welladay would be no place for 
82 



any freedom-loving man. Flads! 
Murv must have enough r.i. on 
him to buy a planet. He sure had 
sold out Welladay! 

Grimly Odis settled down for 
the long run. He’d stay on the 
surface and nm on hydrofoil as 
long as he could imtil the storm’s 
violence forced him to the rela- 
tively quieter, but slower depth. 
He had to intercept Murv before 
the traitor got the r.i. off planet. 

But where had the man hidden 
the r.i. all this time? Every pos- 
sible crevice on Shoulder Blade 
had been repeatedly searched 
once the fishman realized what 
was happening. And Tallav had 
initiated the drone escort to pre- 
vent any fishman from tapping 
too deeply. How the flads had 
Murv managed? 

True, he’d sent his drone back, 
but you couldn’t tap a whale in 
the midst of a storm and he was 
within rights. Indeed, Tallav 
would have screamed if Murv 
had kept the drone. 

Odis leaned forward, tapped his 
own drone’s controls. He printed 
out a message for it to transmit 
once the squall lifted over Shoul- 
der Blade, then sent it to track 
him miles above the coming 
storm. He might just find it use- 
ful to have a drone in the eye. 
He’d risk Tallav’s tantrums. 

There was nothing more Ke 
could do now. Odis settled down 
to a short nap. 



GALAXY 



II 



T he old survey charts Had bet- 
ter be right about that un- 
derwater channel into the Lagoon, 
Murw thought, listening to the 
tortured stress of the fishboat 
and grimly watching the danger 
lights flick and blink wamingly. 
The fathometer marked the un- 
steady ascent as the craft bucked 
tidal pulls and storm rips. He 
must be nearing the archipelago. 

The straps that held Murv 
to the pilot’s seat also cut into 
his flesh, and he cursed absently 
as he began to match the chart 
to sea-viewer. 

Blighted planet! The whole 
thing had appeared so fardling 
simple. He was used to risks, 
trained to surmoimt them, so 
he’d opted contracting as a fisH- 
man, look around for a while, 
spot the trouble, and back again, 
ready for more demanding work. 
On a watery planet, with only 
one permanent settlement, only 
one product of value that was 
in the highest demand through- 
out the galaxy, what could have 
been simpler? He had not, how- 
ever, counted on such a trivial de- 
tail as weather. Nor the mimsy- 
pimsy fardling of a Plane- 
tary Administrator thinking up a 
drone escort to prove his fishmen 
were not the murdering pirates. 
That had restricted Murv’s in- 
vestigations, and he could not 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



lose this opportunity to search 
Crown. Not that it made him 
trust Tallav. Murv knew better 
than to trust anyone for any rea- 
son. 

And Murv Had not counted on 
ssnnpathizing with the great 
whales. After he’d been taught 
to milk ’em, after he’d been as- 
signed a school, it had annoyed 
the hell out of him to see the 
rotting carcasses of whales which 
had trustingly let humans tap 
’em to death. Even lined up to get 
milked. No, the waste — the flad- 
ding waste of it galled Murv the 
most. 

Ah, he must be nearing the tun- 
nel mouth; he could feel the 
fishboat being sucked relent- 
lessly towards the basaltic shelf. 
His fingers flew over the pitch 
and yaw controls, decreased the 
play in the helm and ignored the 
neck-jarring rolls. On fathometer 
and the roiled viewscreen in front 
of him, the bottom of the ocean 
met the ramparts of the old vol- 
cano in a solid wall of tortured 
lava. 

S hahanna was roused by the 
shrieking hiss of the insistent 
wind. She opaied her eyes to 
the grayness, to the realization 
that the crash foam was dissi- 
pating, to the knowledge that she 
was still alive and breathing. In 
spite of the cushioning foam and 
the padding of Her seat, she felt 

83 



thoroughly wrung out. Motion 
was painful. She turned her head, 
groaning as stiff muscles protest- 
ed. A solitary yellow light gleam- 
ed on the control panel, then 
blinked wanly off as she watch- 
ed. The ship had sent out its 
death-knell, the last thing this 
type of spacecraft was program- 
med to do before all its systems 
went dead. 

Shahanna reached with an en- 
feebled han . to her side pouch, 
fumbled for a stimulant and a 
pain depressor. Clumsily she 
jabbed them into her arm and 
then, gasping at the discomfort 
even that slight motion caused, 
lay back. The drugs worked 
swiftly. She staggered to her feet, 
worked her muscles, relieved that 
nothing had broken or split about 
her. Her wrist chrono showed that 
some eight hours had elapsed 
since the unexpected attack on 
her. Automatically she reached 
towards the log recorder. 

“All systems dead, gal,” she 
reminded herself and looked out 
the plastight window. 

Jagged black rock surrounded 
the nose of the scout. 

“How lucky can a gal get? I 
cracked up on land?” Shahanna 
frowned. “Shoulder?” The Rib 
Reefs had been half a planet 
away when she’d been shot down. 
There was no possible entry she 
could have made that would land 
her on Shoulder. But there had 

84 



been some other, semi-permanent 
land masses on the charts, if you 
could dignify a wayward archipel- 
ago or a transient volcano as land 
masses. 

The lock was jammed solid, 
Shahanna discovered, but the es- 
cape hatch was clear. The little 
scout ship rocked under her feet, 
and she realized it had been rock- 
ing ever since she had roused. The 
pitch of the wind had risen a few 
notes too, and water sloshed 
across the viewpane in a con- 
stant fall. If she were on a portion 
of those archipelagos, she was on 
a very precarious one. 

Shahanna wasted no further 
time in speculation. She quick- 
sealed her orders to her ribs, 
slapped additional supplies to her 
belt, shrugged into an all-purpose 
suit, harnessed on a life tank and 
headgear, grabbed the water-aids, 
punched the destruct on her ship’s 
instrumentation and threw open 
the escape hatch. She got a face 
full of wave and drew back sput- 
tering and choking, arranged her 
mask and took a second look. 

Gaunt black fingers of stone 
held the ship but the rising tides, 
wind-lashed and moon-chumed, 
rocked the boat in its impromptu 
dry-dock, grabbing with greedy 
urgency. What remained of the 
aft section of the ship was rock- 
ing slowly down into the water. 

“That guy was a good shot. 
Cleared off my engine. But I’m 

GALAXY 



a live one.” Another wave slap- 
ped across Her face. SKe ducked 
instinctively and tSen, witfi a deft 
movement, was over tKe side of 
the ship, its bulk protecting Eer 
from the worst 

SEe could see beyond, tErougE 
tEe spaces of the finger rocks. It 
wasn’t comforting, for the huge 
expanse of water was equally 
wild. A grinding sound reminded 
her that she had little time for 
deliberation. The ship slipped 
further down the rocky palm. 
Shahanna saluted it, promising 
retribution, and clambered up 
through the rock fingers. She did 
not see that an outcropping of 
rock caught and held the forward 
section of the sliding ship above 
the water. 

This is the damnedest terrain, 
Shahanna thought as she scram- 
bled higher, grateful for the tough' 
fabric of her gloves a she found 
handholds on the razor-edged 
rock. The rain was coming down 
in such heavy torrent that she 
could barely see directly before 
her. The wind povmded her with 
hammer blow. She’d not last long 
in this, Shahanna decided, peering 
around for some sort of shelter 
against a rocky ledge. Doggedly 
she climbed, instinct directing 
her to such height as this tmseen 
rockpile afforded. She climbed, 
hanging on during the vicious 
buffeting of water and wind, 
then inching upward, for what 
86 



seemed an interminable time. The 
absence of water pouring over her, 
the slackening of the wind ap- 
prised her of sanctuary for she 
was inside the little cave before 
she realized it existed. With an in- 
articulate moan of thanksgiving, 
she crawled far enough inside to 
be out of the clutch of the ele- 
ments. Sighing she rolled onto 
her back and exhaustion claimed 
her battered mind and body. 

Ill 

■planetary Administrator Tallav 
watched anxiously as the nets 
drew the battered space craft in- 
to the safety of the Shoulder 
Blade hangars. Almost on cue, 
rain in blinding sheets plummeted 
downward until the dome over 
the living quarters beyond the 
hangars became a waterfall and 
the storm drains filled with alarm- 
speed. Tallav shuddered at the 
ferocity of such floods. 

You’d think twelve-foot-deep 
dikes would be ample anywhere 
— but not on Welladay, he 
thought, as he started down the 
ramp to welcome the long await- 
ed Investigator. 

It wouldn’t do to appear ner- 
vous. Might cause suspicion. And 
he oughtn’t to appear irritated 
that it had taken Federation such 
an unconsciously long time to 
dispatch an Investigator. Didn’t 
they realize the consequences of 

GALAXY 



letting this out-and-out piracy 
of the vital radioactive iodine go 
on for so long? Surely his mes- 
sages had been explicit, the re- 
ports full. But to wait imtil tlie 
Central Credit actually suspend- 
ed all shipments to Welladay — 
that was disgraceful. Disgraceful 
and unjust. 

Tallav slid back the portal and 
stepped out into the rock-hewn 
chamber that housed drones and 
visitors’ shuttles. Such noise as 
the crewmen made in securing 
the ship was lost in the vast room, 
but the net was now retracting 
and the port of the shuttle free. 

Tallav was a little surprised at 
the Investigator’s physical ap- 
perance. Oh, he didn’t expect a 
full uniform for a minor planet 
like Welladay, but an Investiga- 
tor ought to appear in something 
more than a faded, shiny one- 
piece shipsuit 

“I’m Tallav, Planetary Admin- 
istrator, Grade 33-B,” he said 
in a firm voice, saluting the new 
arrival with what he felt ought 
to be the proper deference. In- 
vestigators were not exactly equal 
in status to Planetary Adminis- 
trators, but they had superplen- 
ary powers which they could in- 
voke if circumstances warranted. 
“And you are Investigator — ” 

“Brack’s the name.” 

Tallav was a little annoyed by 
the very casual return of his sa- 
lute. 

THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



“Your arrival couldn’t be more 
opportune,” Tallav went on, indi- 
cating the exit to Brack. “We 
haven’t so much as a drop of 
r.i., and two top priority emer- 
gency capsules came in just be- 
fore you got here. The tone was 
rather highhanded. You timed 
that a mite close, if I may say 
so.” 

The investigator shot him an 
odd look as he ducked under the 
portal. Tallav dogged the lock 
wondering if the investigator 
thought he was being critical. 

“Storms on Welladay are un- 
usually violent,” he continued. 
“That’s why we net everything 
down.” 

Brack snorted and let Tallav 
lead the way to the office. 

“If you’ll just come this way. 
Investigator, my tapes and per- 
sonnel are entirely at your dis- 
posal. We want this piracy stop- 
per immediately. ...” 

“In that storm?” 

“Well, no, of course not. I 
mean, that is . surely my com- 
munications gave you ample facts 
on which to draw some conclu- 
sions? After all, there aren’t very 
many places on Wellady from 
which a pirate could operate.” 
“No, there aren’t.” 

“Now, here we are. May I of- 
fer you some refreshment? Or 
would you permit yourself to try 
some off -world stimulant? I’m 
afraid the commissary is a little 

87 



low . tedious, this business of 
being boycotted xmtil these pirates 
are apprehended and the r.L is 
collected properly.” 

“I could do with some Hot pro- 
tein. Natural . .. if you can sup- 
ply it” 

'^allav decided not to take of- 
fense at the suggestion that 
Welladay could not decently feed 
its population. He roused the 
messhall and ordered a meal from 
his private stores. No sooner had 
he turned, smiling, towards the 
Investigator, than the com unit 
peeped urgently. 

His hand hovered over the 
unit to silence it Then he saw 
it was Hangar calling. The dolts 
hadn’t managed to damage the 
Investigator’s ship?” 

“Well, what is it?” 

“Drone K-Star is back, P.A. 
Or rather, what’s left of it is 
back,” the Kangarmaster reported. 
“Who was that assigned to?” 
“Murv.” 

“Are all the other drones 
back?” he asked, inadvertently 
glancing at the waterfall that 
covered his plas-glas wall. 

“No sir!” 

“What? Who could still be 
afloat in this?” 

“Odis.” 

“Odis? But he . get off the 
line. I must talk to the harbor- 
master.” 

Angrily He jabbed the new call, 
88 



“Okker, has Murv got in yet?” 
“No, nor Odis either. Just like 
that newworlder to try and send 
his drone back through a storm,” 
old Okker growled. 

“What were their destinations?” 
“You ordered ’em out your- 
self. Told ’em to milk anything 
they could catch.” 

“Well, you knew a storm was 
coming up. Didn’t you call them 
back?” It was difficult for Tal- 
lav to restrain his irritation with 
the old fool. No respect for sta- 
tus. And just because he’d been 
one of the original fishmen of 
Welladay, he thought he knew 
more about everything than a 
trained Planetary Administrator. 

“What do you think, Tallav? 
I know my job as Harbormaster. 
Besides, Odis is smart enough to 
run submerged for the Eye and 
drift back with it till it disperses.” 
Tallav shuddered inwardly, 
trying hard not to notice the half- 
smile on the Investigator’s lips 
at the impudence, of his subor- 
dinate. 

“And Murv?” Tallav was com- 
pelled to ask. He distrusted the 
newworlder and would like noth- 
ing better than for him to be 
their pirate. He looked the part 
and he was obviously opting off 
as soon as he could. That was 
the trouble with the Debt-Con- 
tractees : men forced to accept 
undesirable - world employment 
Had no real interest in their work. 

GALAXY 



“He’s not back yet either.” 
“Well, why didn’t you report 
their absence when the storm 
broke?” 

“Did. You weren’t in. Down 
meeting that snooper you sent 
for so long ago.” 

“Investigator Brack is present 
in my office.” 

“Good fer him,” Okker replied, 
ignoring the frost in Tallav’s 
voice. “Now let me get back to 
my Eye. That damned fool 
Sharkey’s out, too.” 

Brack was suddenly very alert. 
“The Chief?” Tallav was now 
fully alarmed first by Brack’s 
reaction and second to the 
thought of losing Sharkey. The 
man was a sheer genius with the 
fishboats, able to repair abso- 
lute wrecks. If he lost the en- 
gineer, he might just as well re- 
sign. He’d never get a replace- 
ment at the price he could force 
Sharkey to take. 

“You can’t test a patched hull 
in dry dock, you know,” Okker 
was reminding him needlessly. 
“Yes, yes. Keep me posted.” 
“Don’t I always?” 

'^he connection was broken at 
the harbormaster’s end, be- 
fore Tallav had the chance. For- 
timately the meal arrived as a 
diversion. 

“And there’s not a drop of the 
r.i. in store at the moment?” 
asked Brack as he attacked Tal- 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



lav’s bounty with more gusto 
than manners. 

“Not a drop. In an attempt to 
fill these . these demands — ” 
Tallav gestured towards the mes- 
cage capsule shells — “I sent out 
my two best fishmen.” 

“In that?” 

There was no doubt of the In- 
vestigator’s disapproval. 

“No, not into that. That de- 
veloped some hours after they 
had cleared port. Even with' 
weather sateUites keeping con- 
stant guard, turbulances can make 
up with frightening speed. You 
see, when there are two or more 
moons in conjunction, particu- 
larly with one of the other plane- 
tary masses in the system ...” 

“Agreed, agreed. I know my 
astrophysics. So that means that 
the only r.i. is either still in your 
whales or preferably riding out a 
storm.” 

“And hidden somewhere in the 
possession of these pirates.” 

“You have proof of piracy?” 

“Proof? Of course. The rotting 
hulks of whales who have been 
deliberately, wantonly milked to 
death.” 

“No more than that?” 

“What more is necessary?” 
Tallav was appalled at the man’s 
obtuseness. 

“You’ve got . how many fish- 
men?” The Investigator’s smile 
was condescending. 

“No Welladan fishman would 

89 



milk a whale to death!” Tallav 
sat up stiffly in protest to such' 
an allegation. 

“You’re sure?” 

“Very sure. And just to prevent 
sucK ridiculous accusation being 
leveled against my subordinates, 
I took precautionary steps. You 
heard my h'angarmaster report a 
drone’s return? When it became 
apparent that someone was tap- 
ping the whales to death', I in- 
itiated a drone-escort for every 
fishboat. The dfone is program- 
med to hover while tapping is in 
process, taking due note of quan- 
tity tapped from the glands, and 
the number of the mature whale. 
They all receive a tattoo, you 
see. There could be no escaping 
such vigilance.” 

The Investigator shrugged. 
“But didn’t I understand that 
there are two ships out, and only 
one drone in? Murv, wasn’t that 
the name? If there’s no drone 
watching him right now. ...” 

“In this weather? It covers the 
entire northern hemisphere. You 
couldn’t possibly tap in this 
weather. Besides, the whales have 
undoubtedly sounded for pro- 
tection.” 

“Northern hemisphere, you 
said? What about down south?” 

“No whales in any great num- 
ber. Shallow except for the Great 
Longitudinal Trench, and that’s 
too deep for fishboats ansnvay.” 

“Who’s this Sharkey?” 

90 



“Our Chief Engineer. Marve- 
lous talent with any kind of en- 
gine or vehicle. Keeps our boats 
afloat and our drones aloft. In 
fact, he helped rig the control 
device so that the drone hovers 
the instant its linked fishboat 
stops. 

“Sharkey, huh? Appropriate 
name for a water world.” 

“Beg pardon? Oh, yes, I see. 
Ha ha.” 

“He’s out without a drone.” 

“Oh, just checking a hull. You 
can’t do that in dry dock, you 
know. And we’ve practically no 
more materials until Central 
Credit releases us long-overdue 
shipment. Besides, He may be a 
genius with an engine but he 
couldn’t tap a wHale to save his 
life even if the weather were calm 
enough to do so.” 

“How so?” 

^T^allav leaned back; tiiese were 
-*■ questions fie could answer. 
“Came Here originally as a con- 
tractee. Whales didn’t take to 
Him. Couldn’t even get near 
enougfi to them to do a tap. They 
got to be able to identify the 
pulse of his fishboat and scat- 
tered.” Tallav didn’t believe that 
himself but the other fisfimen did 
swore that it Happened. 

“The whales didn’t take to 
him?” Brack ecfioed Tallav’s 
skepticism:. 

“Oh, they’ve as much rudimen- 
GALAXY 



tary intelligence as other forms 
of mammalian sea life. They ev- 
idently developed affection . 
or dislike ... of certain fishmen. 
Odis, for instance, and old Okker 
when he still tapped, and even 
Murv, the contractee, have no 
difficulty going deep into schools 
. until recently, that is.” 

“Very interesting.” The Investi- 
gator squinted thoughtfully at the 
watery plas-glas. “I’m sure you 
won’t mind if I take a walka- 
bout.” 

“No, no,” Tallav was on His 
feet too. 

“On my own, Tallav. I’d like 
to talk to the Harbormaster. Take 
a look at the docks and quarters. 
You know.” 

Tallav did know and, while he 
disliked the notion that a Cen- 
tral Worlds Investigator would 
be . snooping — there was no 
other word for it — if sucH ac- 
tivity resulted in the apprehen- 
sion of the pirates, he must sus- 
pend his scruples. 

“And have you a counter?” 
Brack added, smiling slightly, 
his hand outstretched. 

“Counter? Whatever for?” Tal- 
lav was shocked. The very impli- 
cation that he, the Planetary Ad- 
ministrator, might not have con- 
ducted the most extensive search 
for any r.i. illegally hidden any- 
where in Shoulder, that his esti- 
mation of the fishmen might be 
erroneous, that. Fumbling 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



from indignation, he turned his 
own handcounter over to Brack. 

“And announce my presence,” 
and Brack pointed towards the 
com-unit. 

Rather stunned, Tallav de- 
pressed the “all-stations” svntcfi 
and informed Shoulder Blade 
that Investigator Brack was to 
be given aid and assistance in 
his efforts to discover the pirates. 

IV 

T he utter silence penetrated 
Shahanna’s sleep. She lay 
a moment longer, aware first of 
the rough surface on which she 
was bedded, the closeness of the 
ragged walls. Other senses regis- 
tered information: the freshness 
of the air combined with moist 
rock, the filtration of a cmious 
yellow light and the assault of 
quiet on her ears. 

She sat up, painfully aware of 
muscular discomfort and stiffness, 
as she crawled out of the shallow 
cave and looked around. 

To the right and forward, mas- 
sive clouds, black, gray, their 
their churning innards clearly vis- 
idle, scudded beyond the outer 
rim of the old volcano. All around 
now was the diffused vibrant yel- 
low of cloud-strained light: 
brooding, somber yet bathing the 
surrounding area with an odd 
clarity that made this archipelago 
and its lagoon completely clear. 

91 



Far off on the left, Shahanna 
discerned the approaching rim of 
the other half of this storm. She 
looked back at the receding sec- 
tion, trying to estimate the ex- 
tent of the eye and how much she 
might have before the onslaught 
of the second half. 

She shrugged. She had little op- 
tion, and her shallow cave had 
sheltered her well enough. 

Like a flagon, something bob- 
bed up on the waters of the mir- 
ror-sleek lagoon below her. In- 
stinctively Shahanna ducked 
down, then peered cautiously over 
the obscuring rock. 

“The size of it,” she gasped. 
The sealife of her home world 
boasted no such monster as this 
whale of Welladay. 

Quickly she reviewed what she 
knew of the creatures. The fish- 
men of the planet milked their 
glands of the precious radioac- 
tive iodine by means of a surgi- 
cal tap inserted into the gland- 
sac. Therefore, they were used to 
humans. So — could she not 
figure out how to activate the 
tap herself? Her hand went to 
her belt and then fell. 

Even if she could tap the whale, 
how could she get the r.i. off- 
world with her ship a wreck on 
the bottom of the sea? However, 
at some time the fishmen must. 

She stared at the floating mon- 
ster, blinked as a piece of its 
head appeared to lift. 

92 



“A fishboaf.” And she watched 
as a man’s figure was blackly 
outlined against the reflecting 
water. 

She grabbed her hand weapon 
and dropped three shots forward 
of the fish-snout, waving her 
arms in a broad semaphore to 
attract the Welladan’s attention. 

To her amazement, he appear- 
ed to dive back into his ship. 
Within seconds the craft sub- 
merged. 

Cursing her bad luck, wonder- 
ing how else she could have at- 
tracted his attention, and an- 
noyed at such a cowardly retreat, 
Shahanna began to pick her way 
down the basaltic rocks. She 
couldn’t imagine that he’d brave 
the storm rather than face one 
lone occupant of the volcano. 
Surely he’d surface again. 

/^f all the rotten luck, Murv 
was growling to himself. The 
air in the fishboat was rank with 
human and machine stenches. He 
was weary and sore from the 
rough transit of the channel. The 
boat was leaking from half a 
dozen seams which he’d better 
seal before the second half of the 
storm hit him. Of course the la- 
goon would be quieter than the 
open sea but he’d thought to have 
the chance to air the boat as well 
as patch it while the Eye of the 
mach-storm passed Crown La- 
goon. 



GALAXY 



His sonar indicated an over- 
hang along the south coast of 
the Lagoon. Good. He’d be un- 
detectable there and could find 
out who that trigger-happy ape 
was. And if it just so happened 
that he was a pirate . strand- 
ed? Ho la! 

Pirate? Jumping to conclu- 
sions? Flads, who else would be 
on Crown Lagoon in the middle 
of a storm? Tallav had only or- 
dered two fishboats out and that 
figure was too rangy to be Odis! 

MuiVs irritation dissolved. He 
found himself eagerly scrambling 
into his gear. What luck! What 
sheer unadulterated luck! To find 
that passage into the Lagoon it- 
self and to spot the pickup. Flads, 
where had the pirate hid his ship? 
Crown Lagoon was one fardling 
big place to hide in. 

T he unmistakable triple cracks 
of a handweapon had echoed 
around the Lagoon, unnaturally 
amplified by the volcanic rock 
hollows, the water and the curi- 
ous flat calm of the storm’s eye. 
The shots were distinctly audible 
to Odis, busy mooring his fish- 
boat on the outer rim of the 
Crown. He tapped the outboard 
instrumentation button and the 
Christmas tree blossomed. Quick- 
ly Odis called the drone, down 
from its circling security above 
the stormy mass. If he could ac- 
tually catch the pirates in the 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



act of transferring the stolen r.i. 
. Even at speeds no human 
could tolerate, the distance was 
too great for the drone to get 
down in time. He slowed its de- 
scent. It wouldn’t do for his eyes 
to be observed from the ground. 

Three shots, he reflected. A 
signal? He glanced upward at 
the lowering yellow-clouded 
skies. There was plenty of time 
for them to make a transfer be- 
fore the winds picked up again. 
And he had plenty of time to 
find that space-shuttle. There was 
more than one way to milk a 
whale! 

He secured the outboard gear 
and went below for his suits and 
water aids. He snapped a drone 
remote control unit to his belt, 
a knife to his calf-sheath and a 
buckle-and-line sphere to his 
shoulder harness. He carefully 
checked the assist-tanks before he 
strapped them on and, jumping 
into the water, began to swim 
with rapid and powerful strokes 
around the southern edge of the 
outer Crown. There would be 
better plateaus for a space shut- 
tle on the lower south edge of 
the island. 

W hen she finally reached the 
shores of the lagoon, Sha- 
hanna kicked impotently at the 
coarse black sands. Nowhere was 
there any trace of the fishboat: 
nary wake nor ripple. 



93 



“Slimy coward. Twice coward! 
What were you running from?” 

She paused. Maybe Welladans 
were under attack from the same 
ship that had fired on her. Maybe 
that’s why the repeated demands 
for r.i. had been ignored. There- 
fore the “coward” had only acted 
with sensible caution. Oh ho, that 
put a new light on the fisherman’s 
retreat. And, if he thought she 
was one of the invaders, she’d 
never see him again, that was cer- 
tain! 

Disgusted, she sank down to 
the beach, leaning wearily against 
a convenient rock. She forced 
herself to rest, to drain off the 
poisons of fatigue caused by the 
difficult descent. Even if this 
planet had a lighter gravity than 
her own, it had been tiring. 

Displacing enough water to in- 
undate the narrow beach and 
half-drown Shahanna, a fishboat 
surfaced alarmingly close to shore. 
Choking from the unexpected 
drenching, the girl staggered to 
her feet, too furious to be fright- 
ened by the grotesque pseudofisK 
eyes that glared at her from the 
boat’s snout. 

“That’s the last, remember,” a 
rough voice yelled at her. “And 
remember, if I’m not off this 
fardling world in five revolutions, 
I set the investigators on you 
when they get Here. And they’re 
coming.” 

Shahanna jumped back as a 
94 



large plas-foamed cube landed 
heavily at her feet. 

“Wait,” she cried for the f isH - 
snout was turning from her. 

“Can’t wait, you fool. And nei- 
ther can you if you want to get 
off this fardling planet before the 
storm socks us in again. Grab 
that stuff and get off-world.” 

Shahanna watched as the hatch 
slammed down and water foamed 
over the fins of the fishboat. She 
looked back at the plas-foamed 
cube, its shock webbing black 
triangles against the gray stuff. 
It was the kind of protection giv- 
en space shipments of valuable . 

She dropped to her knees, her 
arms involuntarily starting to 
grab up the cube. My God! She 
pulled back. It had to be , . a 
cube-full of radioactive iodinet 
Liters of it, just thrown at her 
feet. She threw back her head and 
laughed, the laughter catching 
suddenly in her throat as a sob. 

“Well, you got what you came 
for, certainly. They got to give 
you marks for that,” she told 
herself. 

She rose to her feet, absently 
brushing the clinging dark sands 
from her legs. Her ship had sent 
out the death-knell. That would 
eventually connect with a civi- 
lized agency which would be com- 
pelled to report it to the author- 
ities and a search would be inau- 
gurated. She had supplies in her 
belt for several weeks, in addi- 

GALAXY 




tion to what the sea could pro- 
vide. Perhaps, and her chuckle 
was pure amusement now, she 
had only five revolutions to wait, 
until the misdelivery was discov- 
ered. 

She felt much better suddenly. 
With a deft twist, she yanked 
the heavy cube to her back and 
began to retrace her steps to the 
shallow cave. That would be a 
difficult hole to find, and she’d 
be safe from the storm. 

The ascent was slower and far 
more treacherous for the cube 
was not only heavy, but awk- 
ward. An unbalancing burden: 
its weight a strain even on her 
heavy-world strength. Shahanna 
had been chosen for this venture 
for many considerations, not the 
least of which was her known te- 
nacity of purpose. She climbed 
upwards. 

V 

M urv watched the delivery 
with a mixture of satisfac- 
tion and irritation; he was too 
far away to make out the features 
of either party, or the cold let- 
ters of the fishboat fins. Murv 
took careful note of the odd gait 
of the receiver, definitely an off- 
worlder, someone used to a heavi- 
er gravitational pull. Murv knew 
to a kilogram the weight of those 
r.i. cubes, yet the off-worlder 
had shouldered it with ease. 

THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 






Muscles or not, Murv decided,' 
tKat was going to be a fardling 
hard climb. The pirate must have 
ducked into the Lagoon at the 
onset of the storm, probably in 
a small shuttle craft. Must be a 
fladding good pilot, too, Murv 
grudgingly admitted, to land on 
a stormy Welladan sea, ride out 
a mach-storm and then trip along 
like that. Murv glanced over his 
shoulder towards the west. The 
black and ochre clouds were still 
low on the horizon but coming in 
fast. He grinned to himself. He 
could, of course, shoot the pirate 
now, take the r.i. back to Shoul- 
der, and get off this fardling 
world for good, all legally and 
above-board, no need to blow his 
cover. But this did not solve the 
second part of the puzzle: who 
was the illegal tapper. 

So a dead pirate informed on 
no one. And tackling an off- 
worlder presented other problems, 
even to a man adept at rough 
fighting from combats on a doz- 
en outer planets. Well, there was 
more than one way to milk a 
whale; Murv started obliquely 
after the pirate. 

Flads! Why hadn’t the fishboat 
swung just slightly to port or star- 
board so he could get at least one 
letter of the code? And why had 
not the fishman emerged further 
from the hatch? Murv could 
have identified him with one clear 
glimpse of profile. Murv ciursed 
96 



again, remembering that the only 
other man out when the storm 
broke was Odis. Murv was cynic 
enough to believe any man cap- 
able of any deed, given the prop- 
er circumstances of pressure and 
opportunity — but Odis? Whose 
love for the great whales was ex- 
ceeded only by his love of this 
drenched world? He was the last 
man Murv would have suspected 
of treachery. Still, you never 
knew what went on inside a man’s 
head. Everyone had a price. 

That settled it for Murv. He 
could not kill the outworlder 
until he discovered the identity 
of both traitor and pirate — and 
learned, to his own satisfaction, 
why Odis tapped whales to death. 

^ I 'o Shahanna, time was short- 
ened to the span involved in 
a one-time simple physical ef- 
fort. One foot must lift, its toes 
finding a hold, somehow, on the 
treacherous rock. The toes must 
then grip, somehow, long enough 
to tense the calf muscles which 
must inform the long thigh mus- 
cles of the effort then required 
of them, to pull Her torso after 
thigh, calf and toe. Arms must, 
somehow, manage to retain a grip 
on the shock-webbing of the, 
somehow, unquestionably valua- 
ble and exhaustingly heavy cube. 

She was only vaguely aware 
of other timely pressures: the 
wind beginning to rise, gustily 

GALAXY 



plucking at tiie overbalancing 
burden on Her back now and 
then, or lightly cooling the sweat 
that trickled down her face and 
into her suit. The value of the 
light around her was changing, 
darkening as the other side of 
the storm neared the island. She 
was completely aware of being 
imder observation, or that her 
tenacity indicated far greater fa- 
miliarity with the terrain then 
she possessed. A sense of direction 
was another of her assets and once 
she had been to any place on any 
world, she was able to retrace her 
steps to it, as she did now, to the 
anonymous cairn amid hundreds 
of others, nearly like it, near to it. 

She dragged herself and her 
burden into the cave and then, 
with a sigh of utter fatigue, curled 
around the cube, one hand seem- 
ingly welded to the shock web. 
The protective reflex as well as 
the darkening skies prevented 
Murv, when he realized that she 
was no longer climbing ahead of 
him, from discovering her. 

He had followed cautiously, 
therefore slowly, and was not un- 
duly alarmed when he didn’t see 
the straining figure with its awk- 
ward load. 

At first, he wondered how the 
pirate could have got so far 
ahead of him, until he reached the 
highest ridge of the southern es- 
carpment and realized that the 
pirate must have taken cover. 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



From here, the island jutted out- 
ward and downward. 

It was then that he caught sight 
of the half-submerged craft. 

“Fladding stupid fool. He is 
not going anywhere,” Murv 
laughed maliciously. “But where 
is he now?” 

Carefully Murv worked over ta 
the ship, using the tumbled rock- 
scape to cover his advance, keep- 
ing close watch on the open 
hatch lest the pirate discover him 
prematurely. He agilely reached 
the open lock, listening for any 
sounds of activity within. It was 
not a large shuttle, a single cab- 
in job. He glanced in carefully, 
taking in the deserted ship in one 
sweeping look. 

So, the guy hadn’t made it 
back. He’d gone agroimd some- 
where up in the crags. Murv 
began to pick his way up again, 
following much the same origin- 
al route that Shahanna had. He 
was unaware that he was being 
observed, for his back was to the 
sea. 

/^din had allowed the tides te 
pull him back under the wa- 
ter, deep enough so that his prog- 
ress could not be seen. He sur- 
faced again, twice, in fact, look- 
ing for an exit up the rock face 
so that he could outflank Murv. 
He was annoyed that it was Murv 
up there on the rocks. Annoyed 
but puzzled. Murv gave every ap- 

97 



pearance of a man hiding: why 
should he hide if He were the 
pirate’s contact? And where was 
the r.i.P Where, too, was Mtirv’s 
fishboat? Odis debated the risk, 
glancing up at the clouds cud- 
ding and boiling on the hori- 
zon. He had kept the drone just 
above the cloud cover, now he 
directed it down, to the northern 
part of the island, for a skim- 
ming run designed to detect 
MuiVs craft. The wind was rising 
enough to cover the whistling 
sound a drone made. Odis flip- 
ped on the visor and bUnked at 
the rushing ocean pictured on 
the tiny screen. He sent it twice 
over the northern arc of the is- 
land, spotting his own boat moor- 
ed on the east but no trace of an- 
other fishboat, either visually or 
sonically. He sent the drone 
aloft, remembering to check the 
wind velocity to be sure the drone 
was at a safe altitude. He sat 
down to think. 

No ship. Had Murv lost his 
fishboat in the storm? Murv had 
a tendency to be too quick; he 
wasn’t all that accustomed to 
Welladan weather and storm, he 
might have inadequately moored 
and the ship was sunk below 
drone sonar depth. Of course, 
Murv might have discovered a 
ledge and moored the boat un- 
der that. One thing was certain, 
the pirate was going no place. 
But who had blown off the after- 

98 



section of the pirate’s vessel? Had 
the Investigator arrived, spotted 
the pirate ship and blasted it? 
If so, the Investigator must sure- 
ly be at Shoulder now, and all 
Odis need do was wait till the 
storm lifted enough to get a mes- 
sage back to Shoulder. He set- 
tled down to wait, a weather eye 
on the approaching storm front. 
He had no intention of cutting it 
too fine back to the safety of his 
own boat. But Murv would have 
farther to go. 

And why was Murv hiding? 
Had those three space shots been 
punitive rather than identifying? 

The wind began to keen, its 
fresh gusts rain-laden in the 
darkening sky. Gouts of lightning 
spat through the bilious clouds. 
Warm air masses moving in, Odis 
thought with approval. Storm is 
breaking up a little. Weather was 
capricious; a real mach-storm 
like this one, despite the pull of 
two moons and the conjunction 
of another planetary mass, could 
break up with' rare speed with a 
crustal shift up north. 

Mtorv was moving, not merely 
shifting position but moving for- 
ward, darting to cover as He 
worked his way back up the 
slope. The rising wind was both- 
ering him, Odis decided and fol- 
lowed obliquely. 

A flash of a head-beam and 
Odis saw that Mxirv was definite- 
ly searching among the hollows 

GALAXY 



VI 



and crevices of the cliff. Odis 
climbed faster. 

He was in time to Hear raised 
(dees, echoing in an argument; 
but the sounds were so diffuse 
he could not pinpoint the direc- 
tion. 

The rising wind added its 
diversion. Odis cursed softly under 
his breath as he jumped from 
crag to block, flashing his own 
beam in and out the darker hol- 
lows, trying to scan around to 
prevent Murv from slipping away 
unnoticed. 

The next thing Ke knew, Murv 
had emerged from a low ledge, 
his arms wrapped around the 
foam- cask. There was no chance 
for Murv to reach his handweap- 
on. 

With distinct pleasure, Odis 
stunned him with a full charge, 
neatly catching the cube as Murv 
folded. 

Keeping one hand on the cube, 
Odis knelt, flashing his beam in- 
to the cavern. He caught sight of 
the darker lump of the prostrate 
body. He turned it over and was 
reassured by a groan. 

Rain began to spray across his 
back as he crouched between the 
two unconscious forms. He could 
just leave them here; they’d both 
be out for a while. No. He didn’t 
know where Murv’s, boat was, 
and he couldn’t permit the man 
to escape. ReRsigned, he settled 
down to wait. 

THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



(4T don’t know wHat you ex- 

* pected to find here,” Okker 
said, his seamed face flushed with 
anger, “but are you satisfied 
now?” 

“I really don’t understand. In- 
vestigator,” Tallav put in with 
understandable anxiety as he 
picked his way across the debris. 
“You certainly cannot have sus- 
pected Okker here, and he is ab- 
solutely the only one permitted 
in the Eye.” 

Brack was sweating from His 
exertions. He had pulled out ev- 
ery drawer, shelf and movable 
fixture in the rock chamber, rap- 
ped on every indh of the rock 
walls, trying to find a hollow; 
he’d geigered everything without 
a crackle for his pains. He didn’t 
mind alienating Tallav or the 
ancient but he was furious over 
the fruitlessness of his- search. He 
glanced at the two men, somehow 
now allied against him. That 
wouldn’t do. 

“This is the only installation 
known as the Eye on Welladay, 
isn’t it?” he demanded curtly. 

“What’s left of it,” Okker re- 
plied. 

“Unavoidable. I ... I inter- 
cepted a message, obviously from 
the pirates, setting up a contact 
point. I caught only part of it due 
to, the storm’s interference. 
‘Southern edge of the lagoon 

99 




where the eye is centered.’ ” 

Brack pointed to the lagoon 
harbor which the single big win- 
dow of the Harbormaster’s’ con- 
trol room overlooked. 

“Your control room is on the 
southern edge of the lagoon. This 
place is called the Eye. What 
other eyes are there on this flad- 
ding planet?” 

Okker regarded him with a 
deep scowl, then slapping his 
thigh, burst out into a cackle. 

“You sure you heard ‘where,’ 
and not ‘when?’ ” He pointed a 
derisive finger at the investigator 
as he danced about in an excess 
of amusement. 

“You fladding idiot, stop that!” 

“I believe I can answer you, 
Investigator,” Tallav said, his 
manner stiff as he waved Okker 
to be silent. “Logical topical ref- 
erences are deceiving to the new- 
comer.” He smiled condescend- 
ingly on the Investigator. “This 
is not the only lagoon on WeUa- 
day. It is therefore possible that 
the message, which you say you 
heard imperfectly due to faulty 
transmission, said ‘when,’ not 
‘where.’ With a temporal con- 
junction, I presume the contact 
point meant the southern edge 
of the Crown Lagoon, when the 
eye of the storm was centered on 
it. Really, most ingenious. With 
proper timing, the pirate could 
make contact, pick up the radio- 
active iodine and be off without 

GALAXY 




being detected tbrougB the 
storm.” 

Brack swung around towards 
the exit. “Let’s go then!” 

“To Crown?” cackled Okker, 
reinfected with ill-timed amuse- 
ment. “Not now. Eye’s over 
Crown right now so they’ve made 
contact and the r.i. is off world. 
You blew it, Investigator!” 

Brack seemed about to explode 
but Okker didn’t budge. Then, 
with a massive effort, he controll- 
ed himself and began to smile 
ominously. 

CtXJo, that’s where you’re 
wrong, Okker. There can 
have been no contact because I 
disabled a small spaceship just 
after I picked up the message. 
Got a direct hit and saw it 
tumbling out of control. That r.i. 
is still on this world, waiting to 
be picked up. And I intend to do 
just that!” 

“Not till the storm has cleared 
Crown, you aren’t. Drones can’t 
handle that kind of turbulence, 
not unless they go above it, and 
that’d be too high for non-pres- 
surized cabins,” Okker told him. 

“I hadn’t planned to use lo- 
cal transport,” Brack’s smile 
broadened. 

“Couldn’t. Ain’t even a fishboat 
left with sound seams. And — ” 
Okker pointed a knobby finger 
at the Investigator — “you just 
forget trying to make it in your 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



space craft between now and 
when the rest of the storm Hits 
Crown. Couldn’t do it on the tra- 
jectory you’d need.” 

“If only Sharkey were back 
with the boat He was testing,” 
Tallav muttered, “that could 
stand the trip. We have to get that 
r.i.” Tallav turned to Okker. 
“Hasn’t that squall lifted along 
.the coast enough for us to find 
Sharkey? Where could he be?” 

Okker shrugged. “That squall 
came up sudden. He probably 
had the good sense to hit for 
the open sea to avoid getting 
smashed. He doesn’t like to go 
seaward, though,” he contradict- 
ed himself, “but it won’t hurt to 
look for him before the whales 
do.” 

“Before the whales do?” Brack 
queried. 

“Like I said, the whales don’t 
like Sharkey. I’ll get a weather 
picture. We’re clear enough to 
receive ...” 

A bleep severed the rest of 
his sentence. 

“Odis to Eye, Odis to Eye: 
Drone-relay transmission. Pro- 
ceeding Crown Lagoon at 1930 
hours. Checking out spacecraft 
trajectory plotted towards 
Crown.” A second raucous bleep. 

“Of all the nerve,” gasped Tal- 
lav, the first to recover. 

“Must be that ship you shot 
up,” Okker said to Brack with 
more respect. 



101 



“He ought not to take such 
risks,” Tallav muttered. 

“Then he would be at Crown 
by now?” asked Brack in a 
tight voice, glancing up at the 
main chrono. 

“Contact that drone, Okker,” 
Tallav ordered. “Maybe we can 
relay a message to Odis to search 
for the r.i.” 

“Not if the eye’s passed 
Crown,” Okker grumbled but his 
gnarled fingers sped with unex- 
pected agility across the com- 
munications board. “Crown’s a 
mighty good place to hide some- 
thing on . full of hollows, cav- 
erns and boulders.” 

“Get him to search the south- 
ern edge,” Brack snapped. 

“Yeah, that’s right, isn’t it,” 
Okker said, glancing sideways 
at the Investigator. 

Another unit began to chatter 
and a sheet of relay paper began 
to extrude from a slot. 

“Weather relay from a satel- 
lite,” Okker said and grabbed 
the print before Tallav or Brack 
could. “Hmmm. Weather’s closed 
in again over Crown, but see 
here.” His stubby forefinger fol- 
lowed the wispy leading edge of 
the machstorm. It’s breaking 
up.” He moved his finger to the 
cloud formations on the right. 
“And we got some of the bonus- 
es. You want to find Sharkey, 
you’d better git. I’ll transmit to 
Odis’s drone. His weather looks 
102 



like it’ll clear ’nother couple of 
hours and he can look for the 
r.i. Can’t do moer’n that now.” 

“Be sure to tell him to search 
diligently for the r.i.,” Tallav was 
saying as Brack urged him out. 

Another alert blasted, and Tal- 
lav hesitated, his eyes widening at 
the distinctive soimd. 

“C’mon,,” Brack snapped. 

“A sublight message?” Tallav 
moved back into the eye. “Now 
what?” 

“Come!” Brack insisted. 

“This is Federation Cruiser 
DLT-85F, based Mirfak. A death 
knell has been received from your 
planet, Welladay. Coordinates 
Frame BE-27/186. Search and 
recover. Search and recover. D-k 
assigned to Mercy Ship Seginus 
X. Advise.” 

“That pirate ship you shot 
down was a mercyboat. And it is 
on Crown Lagoon,” Okker snap- 
ped in a hard voice. 

Tallav turned slowly to Brack, 
his face pale and shocked. 

“Your pirates are more ingeni- 
ous than we’ve given them credit. 
Using mercy boat as a contact 
vessel. Very clever. We must out- 
smart them. Catch them redhand- 
ed. Let’s go, Tallav!” 

And Brack pulled the stunned 
Planetary Administrator down 
the corridor. Okker stared after 
them, his face bleak, his eyes 
thoughtful. He turned back to his 
board, then, and began to broad- 

GALAXY 



cast a message for Odis’s drone 
to transmit. Then he warmed up 
the sublight generator. If he was 
right, Tallav wouldn’t scream at 
the power use. And if he wasn’t 
— let him scream. 

C < T’m glad it wasn’t you, Murv,” 

A odis shouted, trying to make 
himself heard above the storm. 

Murv nodded, grinning at Sha- 
hanna, who was xmselfconscious- 
ly taping her orders back to 
her bare ribs. A bit heavy-boned, 
Murv thought, but no more flesK 
on them than was needed to 
make her a soft handful. 

“Who is it?” 

Even with Odis’s lips tickling 
his ear, Murv could barely hear 
above the keening wind. He 
shrugged, then put his mouth to 
Odis’s ear. “Someone steal a fish- 
boat, sneak out under cover of 
the squall at Shoulder? He Had 
to repeat it twice before Odis 
caught all the sentence. 

“Not past Okker. Only two 
boats seaworthy, anyhow. No 
parts!” 

“Okker might be in it!” 

Odis stared at Murv for a 
long moment, then shook his head 
vehemently, denying that possi- 
bility. So Murv shrugged and 
patted the cube of r.i. significant- 
ly. Odis grinned. 

Shahanna prodded Murv’s pos- 
sessive hand and jerked her 
thumb backward towards fier- 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



self, rubbing the place where her 
orders for a top-priority re- 
quisitioned from Federation for 
r.i. were taped. SHie emphatic- 
ally pantomimed the quantity of 
r.i. needed. Odis continued to 
nod and patted her hand reas- 
suringly. She glared at Murv 
who just grinned back with sheer 
deviltry in his eyes. When she re- 
alized he wouldn’t give her the 
satisfaction of admowlec^ment, 
she reached across and gripped 
Odis firmly on the shoulder in 
an ostentatious gesture of friend- 
liness. She almost wished Murv 
had been the pirate, instead of the 
agent. She wondered if the i.d. 
plate, uncounterfdtable evi<tence 
of his authenticity, ever ached the 
arm-bore in which it had been 
implanted. He didn’t have to 
wallop her so hard when he 
snatched the r.i. Well, she mused, 
he had acted within the scope of 
the information he possessed at 
that time. Jxist as Odis had when 
he knocked Murv out. She was 
sorry, though, she couldn’t de- 
scribe the fisHman who had 
thrown the cube at her feet. She’d 
had the most fleeting impression 
of him but she was sure she’d rec- 
ognize him. However, that time 
was long off, judging by the siren 
winds. Shahaiuia assembled her- 
self into as comfortable a position 
as she could and dosed her eyes, 
to pick up her rest where Murv’s! 
entry had interrupted it.

<4^T^here’s something over to 
starboard,” Brack said, 
raising his eyes from the screen 
to squint through the plasglas 
snout bubble of the drone. 

Tallav flipped up the call 
switch. “Must be Odis. We’re 
halfway to Crown. Tallav calling 
fishboat. Tallav here. Fishboat. 
Answer.” 

“P.A.? You’re in the ship?” 
Surprise and relief colored the 
voices of the respondent. 

“Sharkey? What are you doing 
midocean?” 

“Between the storms and the 
whales, I’m lucky to be any- 
where!” the man snapped. “You 
don’t see them on your screen, 
do you?” 

“We’ve spent hours scanning 
the coast for you,” Tallav inter- 
rupted', angry with relief at 
finding his mechanical genius. 
“You’ve the only seaworthy boat 
and the Inversigator and I — ” 

“Investigator?” Sharkey’s voice 
was sharp. 

Brack elbowed Tallav back 
from the speaker. 

“Brack here. I have reason to 
believe that the pirated r.i. is still 
on this Crown Lagoon the P.A. 
has been telling me about. I in- 
tercepted a message arranging a 
contact point on the southern 
shore of a lagoon, only reception 
was faulty and I missed the en- 
104 



tire message. Do you read me?” 
“Yeah, I read you. Investiga- 
tor Brack.” 

“Good. Now, can that fishboat 
of yours make it back to Crown 
Lagoon? You realize, of course, 
that we must pick up the r.i. be- 
fore the pirate can retrieve it. An- 
other fishman, named Odis, is 
presently believed to be in the vi- 
cinity of the Lagoon.” 

“Odis, but. ...” 

“Can your fishboat accompany 
us?” 

“Yeah, if you can keep those 
fardling whales off my back.” 
“We cannot permit that r.i. to 
fall into the wrong hands, now 
can we?” Brack cut across Shar- 
key’s complaints, more threaten- 
ing than suggesting, Tallav 
thought 

“No, we can’t,” Sharkey agreed 
flatly. 

“Good man. Now, how fast can 
that fishboat go?” 

“Long as those squalls don’t hit 
us, as fast as that airbubble you 
are in.” And, as they watched, 
they could see the fishboat rise 
slightly from the water on its 
hydrofoils, and take off in a 
plume of sprayed water that ar- 
rowed northeast by east. 

Before Brack could speak, Tal- 
lav banked the drone and poured 
on power to follow. 

ttV^ould they send another 
Investigator?” Odis ask- 
GALAXY 



ed Murv, when Okker’s held- 
transmission from the drone was 
completed. 

Murv shrugged, grimacing. 
“It’s possible. This has taken a 
lot longer than predicted. And, 
with the credit embargo and no 
ships touching down at Shoulder, 
I haven’t been able to send in a 
report. They might think I’d been 
drowned here. Now, with Shahan- 
na to identify the Welladan con- 
tact, we can finish it up in no 
time. First we’ve got to get this 
safely to Shoulder.” He patted 
the r.i. cube. 

“The traitor is Sharkey,” Odis 
said gloomily. 

Murv laughed. “I’m not sure 
of anything. Remember, I thought 
it was you and you thought it 
was me, and we both suspected 
Shahanna of being the pirate.” 

“Yes, but your Okker said 
Sharkey was still missing,” Sha- 
hanna reminded the men, “and 
when he’d last heard from the 
P.A., they’d given him up for 
lost and were heading here.” 

“Try Okker again, direct, 
Odis,” Murv urged, glancing up 
at the clearing skies. 

“Another squall between here 
and Shoulder,” Odis reported af- 
ter several minutes of fruitless 
calling. 

“This planet’s fardling weather 
is ... is ... ” Murv broke off. 

“Don’t mind me,” Shahanna 
suggested with a grin, “but ought 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



we not leave here while we 
have a chance?” she added, point- 
ing to the fringe of dark clouds 
on the western horizon. 

“Okay. I’ll check my boat,” 
Murv said. 

“I’ll wrastle this down the 
hill again,” Shahanna volunteer- 
ed sighing deeply. 

“I’ll see if there’s anything left 
of my ship, but I doubt it,” Odis 
said with sincere resignation, 
starting south down the rocks. 

“I can give you a hand part 
of the way,” Murv offered, grin- 
ning at Shahanna. 

“If you think you can keep up 
with me,” she grinned back. 

ttOharkey! The cube’s on the 
rocks on the lagoon shore. 
Just where the contact said it 
would be!” Brack roared through 
the speaker. 

“Oh, oh,” Tallav gasped feebly. 
“However did it survive the storm, 
unprotected like that!” 

“You’re seeing things. Brack!” 
Sharkey roared back. “You’re 
seeing things, I tell you.” 

“Like your whales, I’m seeing 
things, you fladding fool. It’s 
clearly visible. Are you through' 
that passage yet?” 

“How’n hell could I be beam- 
ing to you if I weren’t? I’m sur- 
facing!” 

“We’re landing,” Brack count- 
ered, warningly. 

“I’m not sure I can land on 

105 



that,” Tallav squeaked, unable 
to see any likely surface on the 
tumbled rockscape. 

“You’d better. I don’t think I 
altogether trust this chief engi- 
neer of yours,” Brack ground out 
between clenched' teeth, his eyes 
never leaving the cube, white 
against the black lava on which 
it so temptingly sat. “In fact, 
I find it definitely suspicious that 
he knew such a convenient chan- 
nel into this Lagoon which you, 
as planetary administrator, didn’t 
know existed.” 

“Yes, but . how could he 
possibly ... I mean ...” 

“There’s a flat space big 
enough for this thing.” 

“It’d really be so much easier 



for Sharkey. And after all — ” 
“Land.” 

“Good heavens, he’s here al- 
ready,” Tallav exclaimed as he 
set the drone down on the flat- 
topped slab scarcely larger than 
the drone’s landing feet. 

“What do you mean?” Brack 
followed Tallav’s gesticulations 
and saw the figure emerging 
from the water, heading towards 
the cube. “How’dya get out of 
this thing?” he demanded, fum- 
bling ■with his tunic. 

Tallav reached across him and 
flipped up the hatch release. 
Brack, his eyes on the figure, 
suddenly froze. 

“That’s not Sharkey!” 

Tallav looked. “No, it isn’t,, is 




106 



GALAXY 



it? But who . And ...” Tal- 
lav broke off, staring at the In- 
vestigator. “How would you 
know what Sharkey looks like?” 

“Get out, Tallav,” Brack order- 
ed and turned the handweapon 
on the startled man. 

As the two men emerged from 
the drone, the figure on the shore 
had reached for the cube and 
grabbed it up, starting off, up 
the slopes with more speed than 
either observer thought possible. 

“Halt!” Brack shouted and lob- 
bed off a shot after the fleeing 
figure. 

A fishboat broke surface, its 
hatch flipping open for the fly- 
ing exit of a man. He also began 
to shoot, three short cracks split- 



ting rocks just ahead of the fugi- 
tive. The man turned and began 
to descend as fast as he had 
climbed, now in the direction of 
the fishboat, obliquely away from 
the men by the drone. 

“You see,” Brack shouted at 
Tallav, “there’s the pirate! We 
must intercept.” 

'^allav’s previous doubts were 
swept aside by the urgency in 
Brack’s voice, and he didn’t hesi- 
tate to follow the man down the 
tortuous escarpment to the beach. 
Brack paused to whip a few shots 
to slow the pirate, but he was clos- 
ing the distance to the fishboat 
faster than they could jump down 
the rocks. 




“Be careful of the r.i.,” jabber- 
ed Tallav as the pirate used it 
as a shield. 

The man flung the cube into 
the water and dove after it, push- 
ing it ahead of him towards the 
fishboat, urged on by Sharkey 
who was running down the ven- 
tral fin to assist 

But, as Shahanna, winded and 
half-blinded with watery eyes, 
grabbed the shock-webbing for a 
final heave to the waiting man she 
got her first look at his face. 

“You’re not Murv. You’re ...” 
and she grabbed the cube back, 
frantically kicking out and away 
from the fishboat. 

“Give me that or I’ll blow you 
out of the water,” Sharkey snarl- 
ed. 

“Shoot and you’ll hit the r.i.” 
Shots whistled over Shahanna’s 
head, and Sharkey backed behind 
the flaring dorsal fin. Shahanna 
heaved away from the fishboat 
to tread water halfway between 
both contenders, using the buoy- 
ant cube as a head shield. 

“I’m Tallav, Planetary Admin- 
istrator of WeUaday,” the short- 
er of the two men on the shore 
yelled at her. “Come ashore. If 
you turn yourself in, I promise 
you immunity.” 

Shahanna felt intense relief. 
They’d probably mistaken her 
for the pirate that’s why they’d 
shot at her. She struck out to 
the beach. 

108 



Tallav jumped about in the 
shallows, splashing water in her 
face as he vacillated between 
grabbing the r.i. and her hand 
until she shook him off. 

“I’m not a pirate. I’m from 
Seginus. My ship ...” 

“You survived?” gasped Tal- 
lav. “We got the d-k relayed from 
Fleet.” 

“Your pirate shot my engine 
away,” Shahanna began as Brack 
joined them, lobbing another shot 
at Sharkey trapped behind the 
dorsal fin of the bobbing fishboat. 

“Investigator Brack mistook 
you for a pirate,” Tallav explain- 
ed nervously, “Why didn’t you 
identify?” 

“I never had the chance,” Sha- 
hanna protested. “I was checking 
coordinates ...” she trailed off 
at the look on Tallav’s face. She 
whirled to see that Brack’s weap- 
on was trained on them. 

“I’ll take that r.i., now,” 
Brack said, smiling slightly. He 
grabbed it by the shock webbing, 
carefully stepping backwards, up 
the rocks, his gun pointed mid- 
way between Shahanna and Tal- 
lav, and Sharkey. 

VIII 

S everal things happened at 
once: whoshing sounds and 
enormous splashings from the La- 
goon and a whining whistle above. 
Shahanna launched herself to- 

GALAXY 



wards tKe rocks, Ker body using 
every bit of advantage from mus- 
cles trained on a heavier-gravity 
planet as she leaped towards 
Brack. He could not keep track 
of three attacks at once, and his 
shots went wHd. Shahanna ripped 
the r.i. from his hand, rolling 
sideways and down, ripping her 
suit against the jagged rocks, but 
managing to scramble away with 
the cube. 

When she came to rest against 
a huge black fist of a rock, 'she 
dazedly saw Sharkey running up 
the spine of his fishboat, towards 
the hatch. She heard the despair- 
ing scream as she watched half a 
dozen fishboats close in on him. 
He was tumbled into the water to 
be ground against the converging 
hulls. A bolt lanced past her ear 
apd she wrenched around, trying 
to put the rockfist between her 
and Brack. Somewhere Tallav 
was shrieking. 

“They’ve got him. They got 
him. He’s getting away. Stop 
him!” 

Abruptly the sounds of strug- 
gle, aquatic and missile, ended 
and Tallav’s exhortations ceased. 

Battered and shaking with pain, 
Shahanna raised herself up. There 
was Brack, flung across the rocks 
just below the drone. Odis was 
climbing down, hand over hand 
on the line which Shahanna could 
see had tangled Brack’s feet and 
brought him down. In the Lagoon 
THE WEATHER ON WELLADAY 



its roiled waters lapping around 
Tallav’s knees, only two fish- 
boats remained: one, unbeliev- 
ably, lay sideways on the rocks, 
its belly barnacle-covered, burp- 
ing bubbles that glistened in the 
sun. The second fishboat was 
cruising slowly in to shore. 

With a sigh, Shahanna sagged 
down and laid her scratched 
cheek against the cool cube. 

CtT really don’t credit what I 
-*• saw,” Tallav insisted as he 
watched Mmv and Odis bandage 
the Seginan girl. “Those whales 
. just mobbed him.” 

“Then how could he get close 
enough to a whale to tap ’em?” 
Murv asked with imderstandable 
exasperation. 

“I think I know,” Odis said 
after a long reflective pause. “Ok- 
ker claims the whales got to know 
the sound of Sharkey’s fishboat 
engine when he was still a fish- 
man. When he couldn’t get a rea- 
sonable quota of rj., he got 
grounded. With no money, he’d 
no hope of lifting from Welladay 
so he took over maintenance.” 
“Best mechanic we ever had,” 
Tallav sighed, worrying already 
about the wage he’d have to pay 
for a new one. 

“Yes, he was a crack mechanic 
all right,” Odis agreed. “Any fish- 
boat Sharkey overhauled was as 
good as new. And he tested them 
himself!” 



109 



“Of course!” Murv exclaimed, 
“and every time lie tested a boat, 
fie couM move in on a whale 
whicfi wouldn’t recognize that 
engiae. No wonder we had sucfi 
trouble getting any school to trust 
us.” 

Odis nodded slowly. 

“He’s been the blackmarket 
source of r.i. for a long time, 
then,” Murv went on. “Federa- 
tion had been aware of a small 
supply trickling out long before 
you lodged a piracy complaint.” 

“Then Sharkey got greedy,” 
Odis murmured, looking over at 
the stranded fishboat. 

“But how could he have hid- 
den sucfi a quantity as this?” 
Tallav demanded, pointing at the 
big cube. 

“You searclied witfi a counter, 
Tallav, even in the maintenance 
dock. That’s wfiere we keep those 
shipping cubes, so Sharkesr’s hid- 
ing place would have registered 
chatter anyhow. And then, your 
pet mechanic was always working 
so hard to keep us afloat, long 
hours servicing boats, giving them 
test runs in all kinds of weather 
to be sure they were storm-proof 
...” Murv’s mocking tone trail- 
ed off. 

“Speaking of storms,” Odis 
said, gesturing slqnvard. 

“This fardling planet and its 
fladding storms!” Mxirv growled. 

“I’ve got to get the r.i. to Seg- 
inus,” Shahanna said in a soft 
110 



urgent voice struggling to rise. 

“We will,” Murv griimed at 
fier, “soon as we fix you up at 
Shoulder.” 

“But my ship’s. .” and she 
looked up the rockscape signifi- 
cantly. 

“Brack won’t be requiring the 
ship he came in,” Murv remind- 
ed her. 

“Now wait a minute, Murv,” 
Tallav ordered peevishly. 

“Now wait a minute, Tallav,” 
Murv mocked film, “Brack blew 
up her metcy ship,” and he stress- 
ed the word pointedly, “and con- 
sidering her invaluable assistance 
today, it’s the least Welladay 
can do.” 

“Oh yes, well, in that case,” 
Tallav subsided. 

“Now, you take tfie r.i. back 
to Shoulder Blade in your drone. 
I’ll take Shafiaima in Odk’s 
and. ...” 

I’m left witfi your fishboat?" 
Odis asked, slightly amused. 

“My friend, kindly remember 
that’s the one sliipsfiape fishboat 
left on this wet and watery world. 
And we all know who’s the best 
fishman on Welladay!” 

Odis threw back fiis head and 
laughed. 

“Yes, indeed, Odis, you be 
careful with it,” Tallav added, 
frowning worriedly. 

By the time Odis find clamber- 
ed onto the fishboat, the two 
drones fiad taken off and were 

GALAXY 



circling above Eim. He tapped 
on tbe outboard panel release and 
plotted a course acros? tEe wide 
Lagoon. Tfie drones waggled a 
farewell as tEey wfiistled over

then began to read tKe cfiristma? 
tree’s gauges. A man Had to keep

-I- member, there was a great 
howl in certain quarters about 
Icarus. The Icarus in question 
was not the mytholo^cal charac-* 
ter, but Minor Planet #1566. In- 
Alabama, Georgia and Califor- 
nia there were special prayer 
meetings asking for tKe safe pas- 
sage of the small astronomical

body. About 500 California hip- 
pies, of a more skeptical turn of 
mind, went to Boulder, Colorado, 
in caravans of flower-painted 
Volkswagen buses, convinced that 
I Icarus would hit and that the 
shock would detach California 
from the continait and make it 
slide into the sea. 

It must have been about the 
forty-ninth time since the time 
of Christ that the end of the 
world had been predicted — 
these predictions average three 
per century — and as was the 
case forty-eight times before the 
world did not come to an end. 
Instead Icarus passed on June 
14, 1968 at the rather safe dis- 
tance of 4 million miles, and this 
time we have radar tracking to 
prove it. It was the first time 
that radar was used on a small 
body in space; the diameter of 
Icarus is about one-half mile. 
The tracking was done by the 
Goldstone station of the Deep 
Space Network in the Mohave 
-Desert, An 85-foot dish beamed 
] the radar waves at Icarus; the 
neighboring 210-foot dish served 
_as the receiver. The problem of 
tracking ,Icarus by radar was 
similar in difficulty to tracking 
a silver dollar in orbit around 
the earth 22,000 miles from sea 
level. 

At the time the Goldstone ra- 



dars did their work, just 199 years 
had gone by since a trace on a 
photographic plate had received 
the designation 1949 M A. The 
designation, given in accordance 
with international astronomical 
usage, states that it was the first 
(A) planetoid discovery made 
during the second half of June 
(M) in that year. The actual 
date was June 26; the telescope 
had been aimed at the vicinity 
of the star Antares, and the ex- 
posure had been made by the 
late Dr. Walter Baade. It so hap- 
pened that Dr. Baade’s vacation 
was to begin the next day, so Drs. 
Seth B. Nicholson and Robert S. 
Richardson took over direction 
of the photographic tracking and 
should be considered as co-dis- 
coverers. I 

The first orbit calculation gave 
an aphelion of 183 million miles, 
some 40 million miles beyond the 
mean distance of Mars from the 
sun. Perihelion was then calcu- 
lated to be 17 million miles from 
the sun, well inside the orbit of 
Mercury. 

But the 1968 perihelion pas- 
sage, on May 2, took place 
only 12 million miles from the 
sun. Whether the aphelion ac- 
tually is at 183 million miles or 
a little farther out is not yet 
known. The orbital period is 409 
days, which has the result that

a close “fly-by” like that of 1968 
will take place every 19 years. 

A fter its discovery in 1949 the 
main question was whether 
Icarus would be “rediscovered” 
— that is whether it would be 
found again. As I know from con- 
versations, the layman is a bit 
surprised that this should be a 
question at all. Astronomers, sad- 
dened by experience, know better. 

Here is a short list of plane- 
toids with orbits similar to that 
of Icarus; and all with diameters 



of one mile or less ; 

Of these, Apollo, Adonis and 
Hermes are “lost;” they were 
seen, or rather photographed, on 
one occasion only. Another 
planetoid with a similar orbit re- 
ceived the name Geographos — 
it also seems to be lost. 

But the case of Icarus was a 
bit more auspicious. It was dis- 
covered first by Palomar Observ- 



atory in 1949, re-observed by Rad- 
cliffe Observatory in 1952 and 
in 1953 and, during the latter 
year, by the observatory at the 
Cape of Good Hope and the 
Bloemfontein Observatory. In. , 
1958 Radcliffe Observatory se- i 
cured more photographs and did 
so again in 1956. These succes- 
sive observations indicated that 
the orbit, as re-calculated in 1952 
by Dr. Samuel Herrick, was 
quite close to reality. The diffi- 
culties were mainly due to the 
small size of the object. 



The trouble with orbital dia- 
grams as they are published in- 
newspapers is that they are flat- I 
tened out and show a planetoid 
like Icarus crossing the orbit of 
the earth at two points like rail- 
road tracks. It needs a three-di- 
mensional diagram to show that 
Icarus and the earth are not on 
a collision course. The planetoid 
has its aphelion far “below” the

ecliptic (the plane of the earth’s 
orbit) and then climbs up, in a 
manner of speaking. When it 
reaches the ecliptic it is already 
inside the orbit of Mercury. Then 
it goes through its perhelion high 
"above” the ecliptic. It is only 
on its return journey back to its 
aphelion that is pierces the ec- 
liptic near the orbit of earth; it 
never actually crosses the earth’s 
orbit. 

As long as Icarus follows this 
orbit, a collision is plainly im- 
possible. 

The earth then could only 
be endangered if the orbit of Ic- 
arus were changed in such a way 
that its descending leg actually 
passed through the earth’s orbit 
An orbital change could be 
brought about only by a pertur- 
bation caused by the gravitation- 
al field of one of the major 
planets or else by a collision in 
the asteroid belt when Icarus is 
near its aphelion. Both' possibili- 
ties are unlikely because of the 
position of the orbit 

The high inclination of 23° of 
arc puts Icarus so far below the 
asteroid belt when it it at aphe- 
lion that it is definitely in a re- 
gion where there are only a few 
strays from the main belt in evi- 
dence. And the inclination of the 
orbit also sees to it that Icarus 
never comes close to any of the 
larger planets, except our own 
planet. 

FOR YOUR INFORAAATION 



A few weeks before the now 
historic fly-by, a member ol 
the British House of Commons 
officially asked the govemmenl 
for “assurance that there would 
be no collision.” I do not know 
what answer — if any — was 
given, but the nervous M. P. 
might have been told that even 
in space there is something re- 
sembling the survival of the fit- 
test. Mars, as we now know, is 
heavily marked with ringwalls 
caused by the impacts of bodies 
that may be classified as either 
very large meteorites or very 
small asteroids. We all know what 
the face of the moon is like and 
the earth also received its share. 
A total of 40 large’ (f.e., more 
than half a mile in diameter) 
impact craters are now identified 
as such and more than a dozen 
others are under suspicion. Of the 
large impact craters, the young- 
est is Barringer Crater in Arizona 
■with an estimated age of 50,000 
years. Most of them are many 
millions of years in age and it 
is an interesting fact that the 
biggest impact craters are also 
the oldest. The two largest in the 
Old World are the Vredefort Ring 
in South Africa with a diameter 
of at least 26 miles and RicHat 
in Mauritania with a diameter 
of about 33 miles. The Vrede- 
fort Ring was formed during the 
Cambrian Period, about 500 mil- 
lion years ago. The age of the 

115 



Richat crater has not yet been 
determined but it is at least as 
old as Vredefort. 

In the western hemisphere the 
largest are the two Clearwater 
Lakes (20 and 16 miles) and 
Manicouagan Lake (40 miles), 
all three in Quebec. The so-call- 
ed Sudbury Structure in Ontorio, 
of irregular shape and about 32 
miles in length, is also of mete- 
oritic origin. All four were formed 
before the Cambrian Period be- 
gan and their minimum age is, 
therefore, 550 million years. ^ 

The implication of all this is 
that all the planetoids which once 
were in collision courses have 
ended their careers in the past. 
(Those still orbiting the sim are 
the ones that are not on collision 
courses. Of course some smaller 
ones, presumably more numerous 
at any time, are still in colli- 
sion orbits. Eastern Siberia was 
struck by about 20 tons of me- 
teoritic iron on February 12, 
1947, while another impact (be- 
lieved to have been a very small 
comet) took place in Central 
Siberia on June 30, 1908. 

T he simple question of what 
happens when a meteorite 
strikes the ground does not have 
a simple or even a single an- 
swer. There are enormous varia- 
tions and they depend on two fac- 
tors. The nature of the meteorite, 
stony or iron, Kas nothing to do 

116 



with it; the two factors are the 
mass of the meteorite and its im- 
pact velocity. Of course a falling 
mass of two tons will be differ- 
ent from a falling mass of two 
pounds, but the impact velocity 
is far more important. As every- 
body has learned in high school 
at one time, the kinetic energy of 
a moving body equals one half of 
its mass multiplied by the square 
of its velocity. Therefore, what 
happens on impact is mainly the 
result of the velocity involved. 

Take the case of the famous 
Cape York (Greenland) meteor- 
ites, the largest of which, named 
Ahnighito, weighs 68,085 pounds. 
It was foimd by Commander 
Robert Edwin Peary, resting on 
a gravelly plain with rather hard 
ground. Since it had not been 
shattered on impact, the circum- 
stances of its fall could be re- 
constructed as follows: Ahnighito 
and the other meteorites of that 
fall must have entered the at- 
mosphere more or less parallel 
to the ground, like a re-entering 
artificial satellite. Somewhat 
slowed down by air resistance, it 
still moved nearly horizontally 
just before impact. The season 
must have been winter, with a 
thick snow cover at the impact 
site. 

If the meteorite moves with 
equal “slowness” but impacts on 
ordinary soil, it will shatter and 
just dig a hole in the ground. 

GALAXY 



If the impact velocity is high, 
several miles per second, and the 
mass large, say more than twenty 
tons, we’ll have a crater-forming 
impact, especially if the ground 
is bedrock with only a thin over- 
burden of soil and sand. The 
enormous amoimt of kinetic en- 
ergy shatters the rock of the 
ground as well as the impacting 
meteorite. The meteorite, in the 
process of shattering, will pene- 
trate to a certain depth before 
the heat generated by the im- 
pact can make itself felt. By va- 
porization of part of the material 
a cloud of hot expanding gas is 
produced which acts just like 
the gases from an explosion. The

force of the expanding gas acts 
in all directions, or rather it tries 
to do so. It cannot act too far 
downward, because the rock layer 

is, for practical purposes, of in- 
finite thickness. It cannot act up- 
ward, because the explosion cloud 
expands faster than the speed of 
sound. So the atmosphere acts 
for a short time as a very heavy 
lid. Hence the force is acting 
mainly horizontally, pushing the 
top layers of the impact site out- 
ward in all directions from the 
center. More rock is broken up 
in the process and the rock lay- 
ers around the rim, where the 
force is now too weak to break 
them, are tilted up. 

■’ITThen the explosion cloud, still 
’ ’ confined to the debris-fill- 
ed hole of its own making, has 
calmed down to the point that its 
rate of expansion is no longer 
greater than the speed of sound, 
the atmosphere lid is lifted. Now 
the explosion acts upward, carry- 
ing a large amount of the debris 
with it. Many of the larger pieces 
of debris both rock and meteor- 
ite fragments, are thrown from 
the hole like projectiles, falling 
around the crater within a radius 
of a few miles. This is the rea- 
son why one usually finds more 
meteoritic material in the vicin- 
ity of a meteorite crater than in 

it. A large amoimt of the shatter 
debris then falls back into the 

117

crater so that it is less deep when 
everything is over. 

The foregoing description as- 
sumes that the impact takes 
place on solid rock; if the me- 
teorite should fall on a volcanic 
area there will be secondary 
events, volcanic activity for 
which the shock of the impact 
acted as the trigger. Large flows 
of magma will take place, ob- 
scuring the original impact cra- 
ter. The presence of other impact 
indicators — so-called shatter 
cones, caused by the impact 
shockwave in the ground — 
proves that there was an impact. 
Flows of volcanic material ob- 
scured most of the other features 

T he chain of events that pro- 
duced the Sudbury Structure 
caimot be unique and the maria 
of the moon, the dark spots visi- 
ble to the naked eye. Have been 
under suspicion for a long time. 

The well-known lunar craters 
like Tycho, Copernicus and Kep- 
ler are t^ical impact craters 
in solid ground, surrounded by 
small “secondaries” resulting 
from the larger pieces thrown 
out in the process of crater forma- 
tion. Once impact craters on 
earth had been recognized, these 
lunar craters no longer present- 
ed any problems. But the large 
and generally smooth mare plains 
were more mysterious by far. 
The most convincing (but not 
T18 



then provable) explanation oper- 
ated with a two-stage process. 
The first stage was a major im- 
pact of a planetoid, probably 
much larger than Icarus. The 
lunar crust was assumed to Have 
been thin at the time so that the 
planetoid broke through the crust 
as an artillery shell will smash 
through the ice of a frozen lake. 
Then an enormous lava flow 
welled up through the Hole, 
flooding the surroundings and 
covering up or melting down all 
then existing surface features. 

This explanation, incidentally, 
was evolved before the Sudbury 
Structure was investigated. The 
rather important difference was 
that Sudbury is on earth and 
even in an easily accessible place, 
while the moon’s maria are far 
away. 

And even if one thought 
of astronauts landing on one of 
the maria, the astronauts would 
only be able to investigate the 
surface. They might say that it 
is indeed old lava, but that still 
would not be a clue to the reason 
for the lava flow. 

Now, however, a confirmation 
has come from an entirely differ- 
ent and unexpected source. Dur- 
ing the years 1966 and 1967 five 
Lunar Orbiters were put into or- 
bits around the moon. The main 
purpose of these missions was to 
photograph the lunar surface in 
detail, both nearside and farside.

nearside, and the seventh under 
the Mare orientale. The last 
named can be seen from earth 
only as a dark smudge at the rim 
of the nearside; the Orbiter pro- 
tographs revealed it to be a mag- 
nificent circular structure. 

Well, here we have a case of a 
theory that has been nicely con- 
firmed by evidence that was dis- 
covered after the theory had been 
advanced. Of course the scien- 
tists who examined the data (P. 
M. Muller and W. L. Sjogren 
of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena) wondered just how 
large these heavy masses were. 
Since the orbital data cannot 
tell how deeply they are buried, 
an assumption had to be made, 
namely a depth of 30 miles be- 
low the surface. Under this as- 
sumption the mass under the 
Mate imbrium, if it consists es- 
sentially of iron, would be a 
sphere 60 miles in diameter. This 
is the size of a medium-large 
planetoid, far bigger than those 
that are known to have crossed 
the earth’s orbit. And the former 
planetoids that produced the cir- 
cular maria must have impacted 
the moon a long time ago, pos- 
sibly at the same time that oth- 
ers of their kind caused the Vred- 
efort Ring and the Sudbury 
Structure. —WILLY LEY

THE EAST 

FUGHT OF DR. AIN 

by JAMES TIPTREE, JR. 

None saw the woman with Dr. Ain. 

Most had never seen her before . 



T^r. Ain was recognized on tKe 
Omaha- Chicago flight. A 
biologist colleague saw him in 
an aisle seat while coming back 
from the toilet. Five years before, 
this man had been jealous of 
Ain’s huge grants. Now he nod- 
ded coldly and was surprised at 
the intensity of Ain’s response. 
If he had not had the flu like 
everyone else that autumn, he 
would have turned back to speak 
with Ain, but he shuffled on to 
his seat. 

The stewardess handing out 
coats after they landed remem- 
bered Ain too: a tall, thin, nonde- 
script man with rusty hair. He 



held up the line, staring at Ker; 
and since he already Had His 
raincoat with’ him, she decided 
it was some kooky kind of pass 
and waved him on. 

They both saw Ain shamble off 
into the airport smog, apparent- 
ly alone. Despite the big Civil 
Defense signs, O’Hare was late 
getting underground. Neither of 
them saw the woman. 

The wounded, dying woman. 

Nobody recalled him on the 
flight to New York, but the 2 :40 
jet carried an Ames on the check- 
list, which was thought to be a 
misspelling of Ain. It was. The 
plane had circled for an hour 



121 



while Ain watched the smoky sea- 
board monotonously tilt, straight- 
en, and tilt again. 

The woman was“weaker now. 
She coughed, picking weakly at 
the scabs on her face that were 
half -hidden behind her hair. Her 
hair, Ain saw, that great hair 
which had been so splendid, 
was drabbed and thinning. 
He looked to seaward, will- 
ing himself to think of cold, 
clean breakers. On the hori- 
zon he saw a vast spreading black 
rug. Somewhere a tanker had 
opened its vents. The woman 
coughed again. Ain closed his 
eyes. It was the dead time of 
afternoon. 

He was picked, up next while 
checking in for the BOAC flight 
to Glasgow. Kennedy-Under- 
ground was a boiling stew of peo- 
ple breathing each other’s reek, 
the air-conditioning unequal to 
the hot September evening. The 
check-in line swayed and sweated, 
staring dully at the newscast. 
Save the last Green Mansions — 
a conservation group was pro- 
testing the defoliation and drain- 
age of the Amazon basin. Several 
people recalled the beautifully 
colored shots of the new clean 
bomb. The line squeezed together 
to let a band of uniformed men 
go by. They were wearing buttons 
inscribed: Who’s Afraid? 

That was when a woman no- 
ticed Ain. He was holding a news- 

122 



sheet and she heard it rattling 
in his hand. Her family hadn’t 
caught the flu, so she looked 
at him sharply. Sure enough, his 
forehead was sweaty. She herd- 
ed her kids to the side away from 
Ain. He was using Instac throat 
spray, she remembered. She did 
not think much of Instac; her 
family used Kleer. While she was 
looking at him, Ain suddenly 
thrust his head down and stared 
in her face, with the spray still 
floating above him. That made 
her mad. Such inconsiderateness! 
She turned her back. She did not 
recall him talking to any woman, 
but she perked up her ears when 
the clerk read off Ain’s destina- 
tion. Moscow! 

The clerk recalled that too, 
with disapproval. Ain checked in 
alone, he reported. No woman 
had been ticketed for Moscow, 
but it would have been easy 
enough to split up the tickets. 
By that time they were sure she 
was with him. 

A in’s flight went via Iceland 
with an hour’s delay at Kev- 
lavik. Ain walked over to the 
airport park, breathing grate- 
fully the sea-filled air. Every so 
often he shuddered. Under the 
whine of bull-dozers, the sea could 
be heard running its huge paws 
up and down the keyboard of the 
land. In the little park were yel- 
lowed birches, and a flock of 

GALAXY 



wheateaters foraged by the path. 
Next month they would be in 
North Africa. Two thousand 
miles of tiny wing-beats, Ain 
thought. He threw them some 
crumbs from a packet in His 
pocket. 

The woman seemed stronger 
here. She was panting in the sea 
air, her large eyes fixed on Ain. 
He saw that the birches were as 
gold as those where he Had first 
seen her, the day his life began. 
Squatting down to watch a 
shrewmouse, he Had been, when 
he caught the falling ripple of 
green and recognized the shock- 
ing naked girl-flesH, creamy, 
pink-tipped among the golden 
bracken, coming towards him. 
Yoimg Ain Held his breath under 
stress, his nose on the sweet 
moss and his heart going crash 
— crash — and then he was star- 
ing at the outrageous fall of that 
hair down Her narrow back, 
watching it dance aroxmd Her 
heart-shaped buttocks while the 
shrewmouse ran over His para- 
lyzed hand. The lake was utterly 
still, dusty silver under the misty 
sky, and sHe made no more than 
a muskrat’s ripple to rock the 
floating golden leaves. The si- 
lence closed back, the trees burn- 
ing silent like torches where the 
naked girl Had walked the wild 
wood, and Ain’s eye’s were shin- 
ing. For a time He believed He Had 
seen an Oread. 

THE LAST FLIGHT OF DR. AIN 



Ain was last on board for the 
Glasgow leg. The stewardess re- 
called dimly that He Had stayed 
awake. SHe could not identify the 
woman there were a lot of women 
on board. And babies. Her pas- 
senger list Had Had several er- 
rors. 

At Glasgow airport a waiter 
remembered that a man like Ain 
Had called for Scottish oatmeal, 
and eaten two bowls, although of 
course it wasn’t really oatmeal. 
A young mother with a pram saw 
him tossing crumbs to the birds. 
When He checked in at the BOAC 
desk, he was Hailed by a Glasgow 
professor wHo was going to the 
same conference at Moscow, 
This man Had been one of Ain’s 
teachers. It was now known that 
Ain Had done His postgraduate 
work in Europe. THey chatted all 
the way across the NortK Sea. 

“I wondered about that,” the 
professor said later. “ ‘Why have 
you come round about?’ ” I asked 
him. He told me the direct flights 
were booked up. (This was found 
to be untrue; Ain deliberately 
avoided going to Moscow appar- 
ently as an amateurish attempt to 
avoid attention. 

'^he professor spoke with relish 
of Ain’s work. 

“Brilliant? OH, aye — and 
stubborn, too, very stubborn. It 
was as though a concept — often, 
the simplest relation, mind you 

123 



— would stop him in his tracks, 
fascinate him, so he would hunt 
all ’round it instead of going on 
to the next thing, as a more docile 
mind would. Truthfully, I won- 
dered at first if he could be just 
a bit thick. But you recall who 
it was said that the capacity for 
wonder at matters of common ac- 
ceptance occurs in the superior 
mind? And of course, so it proved 
when he shook us all up over 
that enzyme coding business. A 
pity your government took him 
away from his line, there . 
No, he said nothing of this, I say 
it to you, young man. We spoke 
in fact largely of my work. I 
was surprised to fmd he’d kept 
up. He asked me what my senti- 
ments about it were, which sur- 
prised me again . Now, un- 
derstand, I’d not seen the man for 
five years, but he seemed — well, 
perhaps just tired, as who is not? 
I’m sure he was glad to have a 
change; he jumped out for a leg- 
stretch wherever we came down. 
Oslo, even at Bonn. Oh yes, he 
did feed the birds, but that was 
nothing new for Ain . His so- 
cial life when I knew him? Radi- 
cal causes? Young man. I’ve said 
what I’ve said because of who it 
was that introduced you, but I’ll 
have you know it is an impertin- 
ence in you to think ill of Charles 
Ain, or that he could do a harm- 
ful deed . Good evening.” 

The professor said nothing of 

124 



the woman in Ain’s life. Nor 
could he have, although Ain had 
been much with her in the uni- 
versity time. No one had seen how 
he was obsessed with the miracle, 
the wealth of that body . her 
inexhaustibility. They met pri- 
vately at his every spare moment, 
sometimes even in public, pre- 
tending to be casual strangers 
under his friends’ noses, pointing 
out a pleasing view to each other, 
gravely formal. And later — 
what doubled intensity of love! 
He revelled in her, possesed her 
and searched over every atom of 
her — the sweetest springs and 
shadowed places and the white 
rounded glory in the moonlight — 
finding always more, always new 
ways to never-failing delights. 
The danger of her frailty was far 
off then in the rush of birdsongs 
and the springing leverets of the 
meadow. On dark days she might 
cough a bit, but so did he. In 
those years he had had no thought 
to the urgent study of disease . 

A t the Moscow conference near- 
ly everyone noticed Ain at 
some point or another, which was 
to be expected in view of his pro- 
fessional stature. Ain was late 
in; a day’s reports were over, 
and his was to be on the third 
and last. It was a small high- 
calibre meeting. Many people 
spoke with Ain, and several sat 
with him at meals. No one was 

GALAXY 



surprised that He spoke little, 
since he was a retiring man ex- 
cept on a few memorable occa- 
sions of hot argument. He did 
strike some of his friends as a 
bit tired and jerky. An Indian 
molecular engineer who saw him 
with the throat spray kidded him 
about bringing over Asian flu. 
A Swedish colleague recalled that 
Ain had been called away to 
the transAtlantic phone at 
lunch; and when He returned Ain 
had volunteered the information 
that something had turned upi 
missing in his home lab. There^ 
was another joke, and Ain said 
cheerfully, “Oh yes, quite active.” 
At that point one of the Chicom 
biologists swung into his daily 
propaganda chore about bacterio- 
logical warfare and accused Ain 
of manufacturing biotic weapons. 
Ain took the wind out of his 
sails by saying: “You’re perfect- 
ly right.” By tacit consent, there 
was very little talk about mili- 
tary applications, industrial dust- 
ing, or subjects of that type. And 
nobody recalled seeing Ain with 
any woman other than old Mad- 
ame Vialche, who could scarce- 
ly have played Mata Hari. 

Ain’s own speech was bad, even 
for him. He always had a poor 
public voice, but his ideas were 
usually expressed with the lucid- 
ity so typical of the first-rate orig- 
inal mind. Ths time he seemed 
muddled, with little new to say. 
THE LAST FLIGHT OF DR. AIN 



His audience excused this as the 
muffling effects of security. He 
then got somehow into a tan- 
gled point about the course of 
evolution in which he seemed to 
be trying to show that something 
was very wrong indeed. When he 
wound up with a reference to 
Hudson’s bell bird “singing for 
a later race,” several listeners 
wondered if he were drunk. 

'^he big security break came 
right at the end, when he 
I suddenly began to describe the 
methods he had used to mutate 
and redesign a leukemia virus. 
He explained the procedure with 
admirable clarity in four sen- 
tences and paused. Then he said 
other sentences about the effects 
of the mutated strain. It was 
maximal only on the higher pri- 
mates, he said; recovery rate 
among the lower mammals and 
other orders was close to 100%. 
As to vectors, he went on, any 
warm-blooded animal served. In 
addition, the virus retained via- 
bility in most environmental me- 
dia and performed very well air- 
borne. Contagion rate was of 
course extremely high. Almost 
off-hand, he added that no test 
primate or accidentally exposed 
human had survived beyond the 
twenty-second day. 

These words fell into a silence 
broken only by the running feet 
of a Chicom delegate making for 

125 



tKe door. Then a gilt chair went 
over as an American bolted after 
him. Ain seemed unaware that 
his audience was in a state of un- 
believing paralysis. It had all 
come so fast. A man who had 
been blowing his nose was star- 
ing popeyed' around his hand- 
kerchief. Another who had been 
lighting a pipe grunted as his 
fingers singed. Two men chatting 
by the door had missed his words 
entirely, and their laughter 
ehimed into a dead silence in 
which echoed Ain’s words: “ — y 
really no point in attempting.” 
Later they found he had been 
explaining that the virus utilized 
the body’s own immimomechan- 
isms, and so defense was by def- 
inition hopeless. 

That was all. Ain looked around 
vaguely for questions and then 
started down the aisle. By the 
time he got to the door, people 
were swarming after him. He 
wheeled about and said rather 
crossly, “Yes, of course it is 
very wrong. I told you that. ^Ve 
are all wrong. Now it’s over.” 
An hour later they foxmd Ke 
had gone, having apparently re- 
served a Sinair flight to Karachi. 
Our security men caught up 'with 
him at Hong Kong. By then He 
seemed really very ill, and went 
with them peacefully. They start- 
ed back to the States via Hawaii. 
His captors were civilized types; 
they saw lie was gentle and treat- 
126 



ed him accordingly. They took 
him out handcuffed for a stroll 
at Osaka. He had no weapons or 
drugs on him, and they let him 
feed his crumbs to the binis, and 
listened with interest to his ac- 
count of the migration routes of 
the common brown sandpiper. He 
was very hoarse. At that point, 
he was wanted only for the se- 
curity thing. There was no ques- 
tion of a woman at all. 

H e dozed most of the way to 
the islands: but when they 
came in sight, he pressed to the 
window and began to mutter. The 
security man behind him got the 
first inkling that there was a 
woman in it, and turned on His 
recorder. 

“ . blue, blue and green un- 
til you see the scabs. Oh my 
girl! Oh beautiful, you won’t die. 
I won’t let you die. I tell you, my 
girl, it’s all over now, hold on, 
it’s over . Lustrous eyes, look 
at me, let me see you now alive 
my girl. Oh great queen, my sweet 
body, my girl, have I saved you? 
Oh terrible to know, and noble — 
Chaos’ girl green-robed and blue, 
in golden light ... the thrown 
and spinning ball of life against 
black space. Have I saved you?” 
On the last leg, he was obvious- 
ly feverish. 

“She may Have tricked me, you 
know, Ke said confidentially to 
tiie government man. “You have 

GALAXY 



to be prepared for that, of course. 
I know her!” He chuckled confi- 
dentially. “She’s no small thing. 
But wring your Heart out — ” 
Coming over San Francisco, He 
- was merry. “Don’t you know tHe 
otters will go back in tHere? I’m 
certain of it. That fill won’t last, 
there’ll be a bay there again.” 
They got him on a stretcher at 
Hamilton Air Base, and He went 
unconscious shortly after take- 
off. Before he collapsed, he’d in- 
sisted on throwing the last of his 
birdseed on the field. 

“Birds are of course, warm- 
blooded,” he confided to the agent 
who was handcuffing Him to tHe 
stretcher. Then Ain smiled gent- 
ly and lapsed into inertness. He 
stayed that way almost the whole 
remaining ten days of his life. By 
then, of course, no one really 
cared. Both the government men 
had died quite early, just after 
they finished analyzing the bird- 
seed and throat-spray. The wom- 
an who had seen him at Kennedy 
was only just then feeling sickisH. 
The tape-recorder they Had put 
"by his bed fimctioned right on 
through, but if anybody cared to 
replay it, they would have found 
-little babbling. “Gaea Gloriatrix!” 
he crooned. At times he was gran- 
diose and tormented. “Our life, 
jyour death!” he yelled. “Our 
oeath would have been your 
iSeath too, no need for that, no 
need — ” At other times he was 

THE LAST FLIGHT OF DR. AIN 



accusing. “What did you do 
about the dinosaurs?” he de- 
manded. “How did you fix them? 
Did they annoy you? Cold. 
Queen, you’re too cold! You came 
close to it this time, my girl,” he 
raved. And then he wept and ca- 
ressed the bedclothes and was 
maudlin. 

Only at the end, lying in his 
filth and thirst, stUl chained 
where they had forgotten him, he 
was suddenly coherent. In a light, 
clear voice, as one might ask 
one’s lover what to take on a 
stammer picnic, he asked the re- 
corder happily: 

“Have you ever thought about 
bears? They have so much — 
funny they never came along fur- 
ther. By any chance were you 
saving them, girl?” And he chuck- 
led in his ruined throat until he 
died.

THE THEORY AND PRACTICE 
OF TELEPORTATION 

by LARRY NIVEN 



There's more to teleportation than 
talent. It takes skill and know- 
ledge to do it right. Here's how! 



I 

T T rhy teleportation? Well — 

Y V Last MarcK I was Guest 
of Honor at tHe Boskone, the re- 
gional fan convention held an- 
nually in Boston. Strangely, ev- 
eryone seemed to expect a speech'. 
I hadn’t done any speaking since 
early college. Worse, the audi- 
ence was jammed with MIT stu- 
dents. 

Why teleportation? Because 
that way none of the MITSFS 
(MIT Science Fiction Associa- 
tion, pronounced “misfits”) could 
catch me at anything. What with 



no firm groimd for believing that 
teleportation is even possible, 
there would be endless room for 
speculation without any way for 
some teenage genius to tell me, 
“You’re wrong! Right here in 
my physics text it says — ” 

At that, there was enough ar-" 
gument. But the speech went 
well, even to the point where the 
question session degenerated into, 
frenzied arguments near the back 
wall, allowing me to slip quietly 
away. I’d planned that. But Fred 
Pohl caught me at the docar and 
asked me to turn the speech into 
an article for him. Here it is. 



128 



isclaimer: Any resemblance 
to the plot of ancient or 
modem science fiction, novels or 
short stories, is noi coincidence. 
I’ve been reading science fiction, 
voraciously, for eighteen years. In 
most of what follows, I have 
borrowed freely from my betters, 
and even from my own stories. 
Where I remember ray sources, I 
Have quoted them — sometimes. 

Defimtion: Teleportation is 

any method of moving from point 
to point in negligible time. Over 
short distances we will take light- 
speed as negligible. Over longer 
distances (interplanetary and in- 
terstellar) we will require infin- 
ite or near-infinite speed. 

I make a distinction between 
psychic and mechanical telepor- 
tation. Essentially, psi teleporta- 
tion involves an individual’s wish- 
ing himself from place to place. 
In mechanical teleportation he 
pushes a button. He may do other 
things first, such' as sighting in, 
charging batteries, weighing and 
measuring his cargo, whatever it 
takes. But eventually He will push 
a button here and he will instant- 
ly be there. Similarly, the adept 
at psi teleportation may have 
spent decades in spiritual train- 
ing, learning to negate distance 
by the power of a wish. 

These definitions are not meant 
to be rigorous. Intuitively you 
know what teleportation is, any- 
way. 



History: The history of tele- 
portation is all of the psi variety. 

The prophet Elijah was fre- 
quently “transported” by JahweH. 
He would rise in the air, spin 
around a few times, then vanish. 
Or he would fly about and come 
down without vanishing. One day 
he flew up and up and never did 
come down. His followers search- 
ed the countryside for days. 
When they couldn’t find his body 
they assumed that Elijah had 
taken it with him, into Heaven. 

Friar Joseph of Copertino 
(1603-1663) was a levitator. Us- 
ually in the presence of witness- 
es, he would go into a religious 
trance, rise into the air, fly about, 
eventually settle on an altar or 
in a tree. His presence in this ar- 
ticle derives from his power of 
bilocation. Friar Joseph was cap- 
able of being in two places. 

Then there are past and present 
Hindu mystics and tales of tele- 
portation during seances. No 
matter. The interesting thiug is 
that, historically, nobody seems 
to make a distinction between ne- 
gating distance with a wish, fly- 
ing by flapping one’s arms, fly- 
ing without flapping one’s arms, 
being in two places at once, or 
being blown about at terrific 
speeds by divine or other mysteri- 
ous forces. The distinction seems 
to be original with sience fic- 
tion; it has no basis in record- 
ed “fact.” 




THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION 



129 



I offer the thought that there 
may be no distinction, that this 
confusion may be a fundamental 
characteristic of psychic telepor- 
tation. 

T heory of Psychic Teleporta- 
tion: I’d like to get through 
this fairly quickly, since I don’t 
believe in psi teleportation and 
since my major interest is in the 
effects of teleportation on society. 

1) Consider the following the- 
ory; A man in deadly danger 
would learn to teleport in order 
to save his life. 

I can remember two novels in 
which the idea was crucial: Jack 
of Eagles, by James Blish, and 
The Stars My Destination, by 
Alfred Bester. The idea is simply 
to point a gun at a man’s head 
and fire. One time out of a thou- 
sand he wUl frantically teleport 
out of the way of the bullet, and 
you will have a teleport. 

Forget it. There has been too 
much opportunity for it! Violent 
death has occurred since man was 
definably man. How many have 
learned to teleport in time to 
save their lives? Too few to be 
noticed. 

But there’s another flaw in the 
theory. Psychic powers are no- 
toriously undependable. Bxperi- 
ence says that when the ability 
to teleport is most needed, that’s 
when it won’t show up. 

2) My prejudice against tele- 

130 



portation has a valid basis. I 
haven’t seen it. 

Science has existed on earth 
for — depending on how you de- 
fine science — between a couple 
of centuries and a few millennia. 
We can’t yet build a hardware- 
type teleport system. But psi 
powers, if they exist at all, have 
been around since man was defin- 
ably human. If teleportation is 
both possible and useful, we 
should have been using it since 
men moved into the Nile Valley. 
And we would never have given 
it up ... if teleportation is both 
possible and useful. 

We conclude either that tele- 
portation is not possible, or that 
it kills those who possess the gift 
before they can demontrate it to 
anyone. Both are possible. 

Consider Bester’s “Blue Jaunt.” 
A man in a panic, drowning, tel- 
eports without considering where 
he’s going. He ends up inside a 
wall. BOOM! Bad trip. 

Or, psi could be dangerous in 
other ways. Gene-linked to in- 
sanity or to mental deficiency, 
for example. 

In any case, psi teleportation 
is out. But let’s ignore facts and 
do some speculating. 

P ractice of Psychic Teleporta- 
tion: What about conserva- 
tion of energy? What of conserva- 
tion of momentum? 

These questions are not idle. 

GALAXY 



Stones did not stop falling wlien 
Einstein publisEed a new tHeory 
of gravitation. Tfie old law§ Eold; 
new laws of pEysics usually apply 
only to new areas of observation. 
CEanging one pEsreical law is Eke 
trying to eat one peanut. 

Okay. So wEat Eappens if you 
try to teleport upEill? Does your 
body get colder or lose mass? 
TEere is a gain in potential en- 
ergy. It must be compensated by 
tiie loss of energy of anotEer form. 

Suppose I were to teleport to 
Kerguelen Island? (I am writing 
in Los Angeles. Opposite me on 
tEe EartE’s globe is tEe Eeart of 
tEe Indian Ocean, in wBidS Ker- 
guelen Island is tEe nearest land 
mass.) Because of tiJe EartE’s 
spin, Los Angeles and Kerguelen 
Island are going in opposite di- 
rections. Were I to teleport to 
Kerguelen Island I would Eave 
to land running — at Ealf a mile 
a second. 

Teleportation can be danger- 
ous. You don’t teleport out of a 
speeding car eitEer. 

3) I take anotEer tEeory of psi 
teleportation from The Wotld of 
Null-A, by A. E. Van Vogt It 
seems tfiat two objects similar to 
eacE otEer to twenty decimal 
places will join eacE otEer. TEe 
lesser wiU bridge space to con- 
tact tEe greater. TEis presumed 
law applied to masses, tEougEt 
waves and even wEole personali- 
ties. 



We can’t disprove it. It could 
be a fact. We can’t disprove it be- 
cause Van Vogt never defined 
similarity, nor greater, nor less- 
er. So now you know Eow to write 
a science-fiction story. But we 
can stiU work witB tEe idea; and 
I believe Van Vogt missed some 
great comic routines. Take tEis 
one: 

In one scene in The Pawns 
of Null-A, we see Gilbert Gos- 
seyn on one side of a fence. He 
wants to be on tEe otEer. So Ee 
looks at a piece of land just be- 
yond tEe fence and, vntE tEe 
power of Eis extraordinary brain, 
Ee tunes EimseU to tEat piece of 
land, adjusting Eis own atomic 
makeup to a similarity of witiun 
twenty decimal places. 

Now, twenty decimal places is 
pretty finicky. Gosseyn must get 
witEin tEat range, but Be must 
also make sure tEat Ee will be tiie 
lesser of tEe pair, and not tEe 
greater. One sEgEt slip . « 

So Ee makes tEe bridge . , . 
and Ealf a ton of eartii descends 
on Eim. 

I don’t beEeve in psycEic tele- 
portation. But I could be wrong. 
So: 

We will assume tEat it is pos- 
sible for nearly anyone to learn 
to teleport. A new leamir® tech- 
nique Bas been developed. If may 
be serving DNA or RNA mole- 
cules in one’s food, tailoring 
tEem to carry a superfidal mem-

ory directl;;^ to the brain, as’ we 
now feed flatworms to eacK oth- 
er to transfer learned responses. 
It may be something else. What 
do you get, when nearly every- 
one on Earth can teleport? 

You get Alfred Bester’s The 
Stsxs My Destination. I offer 
the book as a text to accom- 
pany this course. I’ll name a few 
highlights: 

Thieves, uncatchable or nearly 
so, who teleport around the world 
to follow the night. They never 
see sunlight. 

Locked doors, and behind the 
doors, mazes complex enough to 
confuse anyone who might try to 
teleport inside. Otherwise there 
would be no private property, nor 
privacy either. 

Transport vehicles become ob- 
solete. Collectors collect them as 
period pieces. 

Classification of each citizen’s 
telqport characteristics (Bester 
assumes a distance limit. My own 
question: is the limit due to rdia- 
tivistic uncertainty? The more 
d&tant is one’s destination, the 
less certain is its location in space 
and time.) 

Intensive, probably productive 
, research into other psi powers 
(since one has been shown to 
exist). 

I object to one thread of Best- 
cr’s tapestty. If Gully Foyle tries 
t* “jaunti’ along a “geodesic 
curve” he will end by going slow-

er than light. That’s how geodes- 
ics work in Emsteinian space. 
But it doesn’t affect the pattern 
of Bester’s society, which is worth 
studying. 

II 

T heory oi Mechanical Tele^ 
portation: Anyone know any- 
thing about tuimel diodes? 

The field is full of good writ- 
ers named Smith. One wrote a 
story using a teleportation sys- 
tem based on the tunnel diode 
effect. Apparently physics stu- 
dents are now taught that a tun- 
nel diode takes an electron here 
and puts it there without allow- 
ing it to occupy the intervening 
space. If you can do it with quan- 
tum physics, why not with largo: 
masses? With people? The the- 
ory looks good, and it hasn’t been 
used much in science fiction. 

Older, more often used, and 
more traditional is the beaming 
method. You convert your pas- 
senger and/or cargo to electro- 
magnetic waves, fire the beam 
across space, catch it in a receiv- 
er and convert the electromag- 
netic energy back into matter. 

A modification is Poul An- 
derson’s system in The Enemy 
Stars. Poul’s system records the 
position and energy state of every 
subatomic particle in the pas- 
senger’s body. A side effect is 
that the body is vaporized, so 

GALAXY 






tKat tfiat one winds up with a 
complete record of the passenger 
plus a cloud of superheated plas- 
ma. The gas is sucked down 
through a grid into a matter re- 
serve, to await the next incoming 
signal. 

The record of the passenger is 
fired across space. A receiver 
picks it up and uses it, plus the 
plasma in its own matter reserve, 
to reconstruct the passenger. 

I don’t know. I wouldn’t ride 
in one of the damned things. 

The engineering problems seem 
trivial compared to the legal, 
ethical, and philosophical rami- 
fications. Still, what happens if 
the signal gets snarled up? Intfle 
good old days I read of the pos- 
sibilities in EC comic books; and 
the pictures were vivid and Hor- 
rifying. 

In practice, the least bit 
of interference would leave the 
passenger an idiot or a good imi- 
tation of a corpse. Over interplan- 
etary distances you’d have to 
worry not only about intervening 
dust and gas, but about red and 
violet shifts due to gravity and 
relative velocities. And what Hap- 
pens to your soul? 

I worry about that. I don’t 
necessarily believe in a soul, but I 
don’t believe in taking chances. 

If my soul isn’t recorded some- 
where in the process, I’m dead, 
even though my memory remains 
as reconstructed electron tracks. 



■\Trhere society is concerned, 
there are equally serious 
problems. Let’s say we’ve reached 
step one. We’ve recorded our 
customer, and we now Have a rec- 
ord and a ball of ionized plasma. 
Why not beam the record to 
two receivers? Now we’ve got 
a duplicator. The legalities get 
sticky. We could get around them 
by permitting one, say, one Isaac 
Asimov to a planet; but who gets 
the royalties on the Foundation 
trilogy? 

Similarly, you can keep the rec- 
ord. You fire the signal at the 
receiver, but you store the tape. 
Ten years later the passenger 
walks in front of a bus. You can 
recreate him from tape, minus 
ten years of his life. But — aside 
from questions concerning his 
soul — can he collect his own life 
insurance? 

Suppose we change our mind 
after step one. We store the tape 
instead of firing it. Is it kidnap- 
ping? Or, in view of the fact that 
we Have mortally vaporized a 
man, is it murder? Does it cease 
to be murder if we reconstitute 
him before the trial? 

Finally, we assume an advance 
whereby we needn’t destroy the 
model to get the record. Should 
not we destroy him ansrway? Oth- 
erwise He hasn’t gone anywhere. 

Our fourth method doesn’t 
have these difficulties. It is often 
called transposition or teletrans-

position, but that’s too much 
work. Henceforth I’ll call it tele- 
portation. It involves making two 
points in space contiguous . , . 
somehow. Generally we take ad- 
vantage of the fact that the uni- 
verse, as viewed from four or 
more dimensions, resetnbles a 
crumpled handkerchief. Light fol- 
lows the contours of the Handker- 
chief, so that spaces which are 
really contiguous in four or more 
dimensions do not look contigu- 
ous when viewed across apparent- 
ly flat space. 

If the universe does not in fact 
resemble a crumpled handker- 
Tchief, maybe we can make it 
resemble a crumpled Handker- 
chief. It may be possible to bend 
the fabric of space by the judi- 
cious application of electromag- 
netic fields, until two points 
touch. At least we get no embar- 
rassing duplication of passengers. 

The embarrassment arises if 
two sets of machines are in op- 
eration at once, anywhete in the 
universe. At best, space will be 
bent in some tmanticipated way, 
and nobody will get where he 
wants to go. At worst, the fabric 
of space comes apart like a too- 
often crumpled handkerchief. 

D evelopment oi Mechanical 
Teleportation’. Assume we 
have a teleportation transmitter 
and receiver. How we got these 
is a matter for science fiction; 
134 



but once we have them we can 
move onto surer ground. We as- 
sume that the principle does not 
involve beaming; it may involve 
tunnel diode effects or space- 
bending or something new. 

So we’ve -got two enclosed 
booths . 

Why booths? 

Because of an old principle 
that two bodies cannot occupy 
the same space at the same time. 
Like a lot of old principles, this 
one isn’t strictly true. Matter is 
mostly empty space. There is no 
reason why you can’t teleport 
into a rock there’s plenty of room 
for your atoms and the rock’s 
atoms. Trouble is it’ll kill you. 

Teleporting into a mass of air 
will kill you too. There are en- 
ergy factors involved, and also 
bends, embolisms, etc. Probably 
there will be an explosion. 

So you. need booths. Natural- 
ly the interior spaces are identi- 
cal in size and shape. The trans- 
mitter booth includes air as well 
as the passenger cargo. The re- 
ceiver is evacuated. We teleport 
the air as well as the passenger 
and/or cargo. 

If what we have are transceiv- 
ers, we need not evacuate the re- 
ceiver. We teleport its air to 
the transmitter as we teleport 
the cargo to the receiver. 

With development, we may be 
able to do away with the booths. 
If we expand a spherical force ■»

we expect a rise in temperature

Bootfi D is built on railroad 
tracks. We set it moving to de- 
termine if conservation of mo- 
mentum Eolds. Given relativity 
we migfit as well use bootfi D 
as receiver only. Tfius we can 
pad tfie back wall, in case con- 
servation does Bold. 

Bootfis E and F test for con- 
tinuous teleportation. Bullets are 
fired into tfie opening in E at 
various speeds. WEicfi bullet will 
reacfi F before it strikes tfie

THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION 



Head and clonk the scientist with 
itEe feathered end. I’m sure there’s 
a better way to design this sys- 
fens. 

Ill 

P ractice of Mechanical Tele- 
portation: Here my theme 
becomes complex. I intend to 
demonstrate that any limitations 
we assume for our teleportation 
system are going to imply a 
Mciety: one society for each set 
of limitations. Again, I will quote 
my sources where I can remem- 
ber them, sometimes. But much 
of what follows is my own. 

The assumption: We do not 
need a transmitter. Our teleport 
receiver will bring anjdhing to 
itself, from anywhere. Limita- 
tions may exist as to distance or 
mass of cargo. 

The result: Thieves capable of 
stealing anything from anyone in 
perfect safety. Such machinery 
was discovered by Seaton, and 
later by DuQuesne in THE SKY- 
LARK OF SPACE. In practice, 
anyone who Has such- machinery 
is Wng of the world. If many men 
have transmittterless receivers, 
society falls apart. When society 
stops making parts for the ma- 
chines, the machines fall apart, 
and eveiything starts over. 

The assumption: No receiver is 
needed. Our teleport transmit- 
13d 



ter will place its cargo anywhere. 

The result: We can put a 
bomb anywhere. The idea was 
used at least once, in The Per- 
son horn Porlock. In practice, 
a government that owned one of 
these would own the world. Two 
such governments would prob- 
ably bomb each other back to a 
pre-teleport level of civilization. 

Given the two above assump- 
tions, you don’t really get a so- 
ciety. You get a short war. Hence 
most stories assume that tele- 
portation requires a transmitter 
and a receiver. 

Let’s do the same. Let us fur- 
ther assume that transmitters 
(transceivers?) look like tele- 
phone booths. You walk into a 
booth, you put a coin in the slot, 
you dial. You’re elsewhere. 

How do they work? We as- 
sume either space-bending or the 
tunnel diode effect. We assume 
the operation is relatively cheap: 
no more than a few quarters in 
the slot. Finally, a slug in the 
slot will send the customer 
straight to police headquarters. 

The result: All present trans- 
portation becomes obsolete: cars 
and trucks and freeways, ships 
and train stations. What do we 
do with a continental net of free- 
ways once the cars and busses 
have disappeared? You use them 
for drag races and bicycle rid- 
ing; you put houses on them or 
turn them into parks. Or you 

GALAXY 



pack tHem witli cars because 
th'ere’s no place else to put the 
damn useless cars. Not only 
freeways and turnpikes, but 
streets and roads and even side- 
walks become obsolete. In busi- 
ness district you keep the side- 
walks for window shopping. Else- 
where, pfftt! 

The mind boggles. Assume the 
population problem continues in 
the direction it’s going. Then, 
as Isaac Asimov has suggested, 
new generations could grow up 
without seeing the exterior of 
any building, including their 
own homes. There might soon be 
no countryside to see in any case, 
and precious few exteriors to 
buildings. Without need for 
streets or sidewalks, there would 
be no space between buildings; 
They would be built wall to 
wall, or in units a mile cubic. 
And the people get their exer- 
cise by riding bicycles between 
two open booths arranged like 
E and F in Figure I. 

T)ut suppose there are limita- 
tions on the booths? For 
each assumed limitation one gets 
a different society. Let’s take a 
few examples. 

The assumption: Booths are 
expensive to operate. The price 
for any jump, regardless of dis- 
tance, is two hundred dollars. (A 
reasonable restriction. Any space- 
stressing operation might well 



cost as much as any other. Ditto 
for a single tunnel-diode opera- 
tion.) 

The result: Cars, motor scoot- 
ers, busses will remain. Except for 
emergencies, nobody would use 
the booth for distances shorter 
than a transcontinental flight. 
But airplanes would disappear, 
except perhaps for cargo flights. 

Change the price, and you 
change the result. As price goes 
down, freight traffic by train and 
truck dwindles, and then even au- 
tomobiles begin to go. Raise the 
price to a few thousand dollars, 
and only spacecraft disappear. 

The assumption: The booth's 
are cheap, a couple of bucks a 
jump, but limited as to- distance. 
Ten miles, let us say, is the upper 
limit. 

The results: A traveler would 
move in Hops, naturally. But 
there would come a point where 
an airplane is cheaper or more 
convenient, or both, than a suc- 
cession of teleport booths. Thus, 
c^ would go, but airplanes and 
shipping would remain. 

Change the limiting distance 
and, again, you change the so- 
ciety. At a mile a jump only the 
cars go. At a thousand miles a 
junjp, only spacecraft remain. 

The assumption: Teleportation 
is limited by the Laws of Con- 
servation of Energy and Momen- 
tum. 

The Result: Not very different 

137 



THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION 



from above. Cars would go; air- 
planes would remain. By telepor- 
tation we could not travel long 
distance north and south; we 
would have to do it on short 
hops. The longer the hop, the 
Harder momentum would jerk 
the passenger sideways each time. 

Traveling east, our momentum 
would lift us a few inches from 
the chair of the receiver booth 
on each hop. (Yes, I said chair. 
You might try it standing up, 
but I wouldn’t.) Traveling west 
would be worse : momentum 

would slam you down hard. A 
New Yorker might prefer to reach 
San Francisco via the western 
route in a line of booth's cross- 



ing the Atlantic and Pacific 
Oceans. 

Notice one important excep- 
tion. We can travel from the 
northern hemisphere to the south- 
ern in perfect comfort, provided 
the departure point and destina- 
tion are at corresponding lati- 
tudes. 

Elevators become more impor- 
tant than ever. In Earth’s gravi- 
tational field, at ground level, we 
lose seven degrees Fahrenheit for 
every mile we teleport upward 
. and we gain as much going 
downhill. Elevators are more 
comfortable. 

So: you want to go skiing in 
the Swiss Alps, at St. Moritz.

From tlie United States your best 
bet is to take a plane to some- 
place witfi a big landing field, 
ride an elevator Half a mile up 
>■ to a teleportation bootS, tKen 
teleport to St. Moritz. Do it any 
other way and you wind up sick 
for a couple of days. And from 
^ New York you can reach Angol, 
^ Chili in one jump. 

S o much for the booths. They 
still look like our best at- 
tempt at prophecy; but let’s try 
some wilder ideas and see what 
we get. 

The assumption: Our teleport 
discs. You step on a disc, it tele- 
ports you to another disc. Cost, 
pennies per thousand trips. 

The results: All present trans- 
portation disappears. With the 
proper setup, you can walk any- 
where on the planet. Figure II 
is a design for intercity transpor- 
tation, but it can easily be adapt- 
ed for longer distances. TKe 
blocks shown could be lines of 
longitude and latitude; their 
length is optional. 

For the rectangular city lay- 
out shown, we simply walk in the 
direction we wish to go. The dis- 
tance between the receiver plate, 
at the center of the intersection, 
and the next transmitter disc is 
about three paces. In three paces 
one covers a block, whose length, 
I repeat, is optional. Perhaps 
there would be faster lanes 



through the center of town, and 
faster still between towns: in- 
tersections a mile or ten miles 
apart To get out of the system 
one walks around the final disc 
and goes window shopping or 
whatever. 

The biggest advantage is that 
we can give up all the dialing. 

The assumption: Our trans- 
mitter is Hand-sized. We can 
hang it from our belt It has a 
telephone-type dial on it. The re- 
ceiver is bigger: an open plat- 
form, either a small plate at 
Home, in vestibule, or a com- 
munity receiver the size of a 
public square. Cost is equivalent 
to the cost of using a telephone. 
There are (if necessary) compen- 
sators for momentum- and heat- 
transfer in the receiver plates. 

The results Hester’s The Stars 
My Destination, with minor 
changes. No mazes behind the 
doors; simply unlisted receiver 
numbers. 

S hall we design a few space- 
craft? Limited teleportation 
might not make spacecraft obso- 
lete. It might even be used to 
improve the spacecraft them- 
selves. 

The assumptions: Teleporta- 
tion requires both a transmitter 
and a receiver. Conservation 
holds. Teleportation is instantan- 
eous and does not involve beam- 
ing. 



THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION 



139 



The result: See Figure III, The 
ship consists mainly of a couple 
of rocket motors, fuel tanks, and 
an open-ended teleportation re- 
ceiver open to the rear. You can 
leave it open because, in vacuum, 
you don’t need to worry about air 
getting in the receiver. 

The ship, unmanned, is fired 
from Earth’ orbit or from further 
out. Probably it should be fired 
in the direction of the galactic 
core, where we anticipate more 
traffic. By firing the ship from, 
say, Jupiter orbit, we can pack 
quite a lot of fuel — water, for 
reaction mass — outside the ship. 
(See Asimov The Martian Way). 

We use all’ the fuel except a 
reserve for steering. The ship 
coasts. 

It passes through a star sy- 
tem. Let it be about the size of 
the solar system; then we have 
ten hours (assuming our ship 
is near lightspeed) to shove an 
entire prefab colony into the 
Earth-based transmitter. If all 
ten hours are used, then the col- 
ony building materials are strewn 
across the entire system. Each 
piece of equipment arrives at 
rest with respect to Earth and 
thus leaves the receiver at a speed 
approaching lightspeed, (Now 
you know why we put a hole in 
the receiver.) 

Last through the receiver are 
the ships designed to collect all 
this junk. Since they are manned^ 

140

we had better not send them 
from Earth. Conservation of en- 
ergy would freeze the pilots to 
ice in an instant. Consider the 
irony: to keep them from freez- 
ing, we must ship them from Plu- 
to orbit! 

It might be more efficient to 
send through the teleport sys- 
tem only a few ships and anoth- 
er prefab teleport receiver. The 
rest of the colony comes through 
the second receiver. 

In any case, notice fom’ advan- 
tages. You don’t have to carry 
the entire cargo or waste fuel 
accelerating it. You don’t decel- 
erate the ship, so none of your 
limited fuel supply need be re- 
served foi; that purpose. The col- 

GALAXY 



(mists need not twiddle their 
thumbs for decades. And tfie ship 
can be re-used. Can and will. 
You just let it coast. Every time 
it comes near a star system, you 
have another colony. In eighty 
thousand years we leave a line 
of colonies clear across the gal- 
axy, before we finally run out of 
stars. 

Less peaceful societies would 
shove war fleets through the tel- 
eport system. It is Hard to imag- 
ine a safer way to make war. The 
fleet is strewn all across the sys- 
tem, with all the warships at rest 
with repect to the universe at 
large. And How could the target 
system counterattack? To reach 
the invading system, they would 
Have to catch a ship which has 
had years to accelerate to its tre- 
mendous velocity, and which is 
long gone into interstellar space 
before the attack can even be- 
gin. 

IV 

D uring the Boston speech, a 
member of the audience sug- 
gested that teleportation be used 
to fuel the above craft. Specifi- 
cally: the motor is a receiver, 
open, with a flared nozzle attaeh- 
ed. We drop a transmitter on 
Jupiter. Presto! Hellishly dense 
high-pressure gas expands ex- 
plosively into the vacuiun of 
space, driving the ship forward. 



Fuel supply: inefficient compar- 
ed to ion drives or the like, but 
almost literally unlimited. 

It won’t work. Rather, it won’t 
work for long. 

Remember, we have assumed 
that conservation Holds. The mo- 
tor’s exhaust velocity is the ship’s 
own limiting velocity if we use 
teleportation to fuel the ship. 
Jupiter’s atmosphere wouldn’t 
expand fast enough' to be useful. 
Even with a fusion drive, we lose 
momentum every time a droplet 
of hydrogen reaches the fuel 
tank. We Have to get it back by 
firing the droplet through the 
rocket motor. When the two bal- 
ance . i . we can’t go any faster. 

Total conversion of matter to 
light does give us imlimited vel- 
ocity. Then we have only the 
problem of what to do with the 
incoming fuel. We always have 
that problem. A droplet of hy- 
drogen moving at a tenth of 
lightspeed would vaporize any 
fuel tank we can build today. 
Maybe in the future . with 
new materials . plenty of pad- 
ding . springs . 

Let’s try something else. 

The assumptions: The distance 
one can teleport is relatively re- 
stricted. The greater the curva- 
ture of space — that is, the great- 
er the proximity to a large mass 
— the shorter is the limiting dis- 
tance. We will assume that on 
Earth the linaiting distance k two 

141 



THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION 



feet; around Mar’s orbit, some 
miles; between stars, a few light- 
minutes. Attempt to send a mass 
beyond the limiting distance, and 
it will emerge from the receiver as 
a fluid or a fine dust. The cur- 
vature of space distorts the re- 
lationships between atoms too 
greatly. 

Again, we assume the conserva- 
tion laws hold. 

The results: Feeble as far as 
teleportation is concerned. We 
can teleport fluids, so fuel tanks 
disappear except for storage 
tanks and spacecraft. The best 
we can do for spacecraft is fuel 
a booster, with a Heavily armored 
fuel tank, designed to lift space- 
craft out of a gravity well at low 
speed. But we can use the sys- 
tem to build a ship . 

Oee Figure IV. We’ll call this pe- 
culiar object the “end-tele- 
port drive,” and we’ll say that 
it teleports itself onto its own 
front end. I invented it many years 
ago, but I never had the nerve 
to write a story about it. 

Notice that if you push the 
button, the ship teleports onto its 
own front end; but if you held 
the button down, it will teleport 
repeatedly, in a steady stream of 
images. 

One jump brings the ship 
to position 2 but the moment it 
begins to occupy position 2 it 
wants to be at position 3; as that 
142 




GALAXY 



image starts to form, the ship 
wants to be at position 4, et 
cetera. If teleportation is rapid 
enougH we can use it for trans- 
portation. 

You refuse to believe in my 
ship? Then think of it, as an ex- 
ercise in speculation. Ridiculous 
as it may seem, we do get re- 
sults : 

1) Rate-of -travel of the ship 
'is limited only by mechanical 
difficulties, that is, by the rate 
of successive teleportation. The 
end-teleport drive does not ef- 
fect the ship’s kinetic energy. 
We change only the position. 
So there is none of this non- 
sense about relativity. 

2) We must assume a me- 
chanical limit on rate-of -travel. 
Otherwise the ship goes off the 
edge of the universe. 

3) You can take your finger 
off the button. Kinetic energy is 
teleported along with everything 
else; and as a perfect image you 
have free will. 

4) The longer the ship is, the 
faster it will go, with a given 
rate-of -teleportation. But; the 
longer the ship is, the greater is 
the danger of getting too near a 
large mass. To land on Earth 
the ship would have to be less 
than two feet long. 

In fact, you can’t land it any- 
where with the end-teleport 
drive. As with the inertialess 
drives in Doc Smith’s Lensman 



series, you keep an intrinsic veloc- 
ity which reappears when the 
drive goes off. 'To land the ship 
ans^here you need either in- 
board auxiliary rockets or rock- 
et tugs. 

5) What happens if something 
gets in the way of the ship? 

Good question. Many things 
definitely will. Light, for exam- 
ple. 

A light beam crosses interstel- 
lar space. Suddenly, for an in- 
stant, the end-teleport ship is oc- 
cupying that space. The ship’s 
walls can’t stop it,- for the light 
never encountered the walls. A 
human eye can stop it if the 
light happens to reach that eye 
in time. 

Result: everything on the ship 
is transparent. If we assume that 
some light will be picked up by 
the teleportation field and car- 
ried along with the ship, then 
how transparent everything is will 
depend on two things; the rate 
of travel anc^the distance of an 
object from the passenger’s eye. 
His hand is nearly opaque. The 
further wall is nearly invisible, 
because so much light is being 
picked up in the space between 
wall and eye . and dropped be- 
tween wall and eye. The cabin in 
Figure IV is unnecessary unless 
the ship carries rocket auxiliaries. 
With the end-teleport drive go- 
ing, the stars are visible anywhere 
you look. 

143 



THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION 



Tf tlie teleportation field will 
-*■ not transport ligKt, tHe situa- 
tion becomes more serious. At a 
useful rate of travel a ligKt beam 
would Have just time to traverse 
the diameter of a Human eye be- 
fore the eye disappears. So a Hu- 
man eye will still function. But 
tHe ship and all its contents, in- 
cluding the passenger, are totally 
invisible, and eacH passenger be- 
comes a disembodied viewpoint 
falling between tfie stars. 

Travel even faster, and a ligKt 
beam may Have time to toucH 
tHe retina witKout first entering 
tfie lens of tfie eye. Now every- 
thing becomes a blur. On arrival 
tHe passenger becomes a psycKia-< 
trie patient. 

6) Interstellar dust would also 
be picked up en route. Most of 
it could be Handled by a tougH 
air-conditioning system; but a 
certain proportion would appear 
a.lready inside tfie transitory 
space occupied by tfie passenger. 
Definitely fie would need medi- 
cal attention on arrival. 

7) Interstellar Hydrogen would 
be swept up by tHe moving sKip. 
Aboard an end-teleport drive 
there would be absolutely no 
smoking. Drinking, yes . 

8) As for meteors and larger 
bodies . we’ll use a trick. 

Let’s say we’re going toward 
tHat galactic core, i.e., toward Sag- 
ittarius. Okay. Before we leave 
the system, we take our sfiip to 
144 



within a few million miles of the 
Sun, on the Sagittarius side; and 
we hover. 

We Hover by end-teleporting 
outward as the Sun’s gravity 
draws us in ward. Half an Hour 
of tins should give us a respecta- 
ble intrinsic velocity Sunward. 
Now we take off toward Sagit- 
tarius. 

So we ram sometfiing enroute. 
It can Happen. 

But ... it takes energy to 
make two solid masses occupy 
tfie same space. Cfiances are we 
cannot teleport into wHat we’ve 
rammed. 

A fuse flows, and tfie mo- 
tor stops. THat leaves tHe sfiip 
witH its intrinsic velocity, wfiicH 
we Have built up Hugely in a di- 
rection opposite to tfie direction 
of travel. 

So the sfiip backs up at Hun- 
dreds of miles per second! Even 
if we ram a planet, our intrinsic 
velocity is ffigfier tfian escape 
velocity, and we’re safe. 

9) Conservation of energy 
rears its Head once more. THe 
sKip becomes fiendisfily cold as it 
leaves tfie solar system, and body 
temperature drops simultaneous- 
ly. 

Tfie reverse occurs as we enter 
a system. It’s a good tfiing we 
built a Heavy air-conditioning 
system to get rid of all tHat dust. 
We’ll need it for temperature 
control.

Bold? 

Tfiis question caused a series 
of soapbox speteKes, mostly in my 
defense along tlie back wall of 
my Boston audience. TKe as- 
sumptions are important, and I’m 
going to try to justify tbem. 

1) TKe beKavior of tKe imi- 
verse does not cKange. .In all 
known cases tKe laws of conser- 
vation of energy and momentum 
Hold rigorously. Now we use 
tfiem for prediction. TKe exist- 
ence and most of tKe properties 
of tKe neutrino were predicted by 
use of tKese and other conserva- 
tion lawra. Later the neutrino 
itself was detected through judi- 
cious use of its own proposed 
properties. 

If today’s physicists can use 
conservation to predict gKost 
particles, I can use them to pre- 
dict the beKavior of a teleport 
system. 

2) In any case, I’m entitled 
to make any assumptions I like, 

If they are internally consistent. 

This is an exercise in speculation, 
remember? Speculation starts 
with assumptions. If you don’t 
like mine, try your own; you 
might get interesting results. 

3) A passenger teleporting

bits. Then the electrons drop 
back, releasing photons. TKe pho- 
tons are absorbed before they 
reach the passenger’s skin, giving 
heat. 

But almost any reasonable pro- 
cess will ultimately end in heat. 
Heat is the most general, most 
randomized form of energy. 

Could the released energy ap- 
pear as neutrinos? TSat would 
not give Heat. But it would up- 
set some of tfie obscure parity 
laws of nuclear pHysics (thus up- 
setting Isaac Asimov, Hal Clem- 
ent, and thousands of reactionary 
physicists), and it would make 
uphill t^eportation impossible,

stroy neUjtrinos which weren’t

T Tow about a perpetual-mo- 
tion machine? 

See Figure V. The idea is to 
use open transmitter and receiv- 
er booths. TKe cargo, thirty gal- 
lons of water, is teleported to the 
receiver. It immediately pours 
out into the open transmitter, 
which teleports it back to the re^ 
ceiver, ei cetera. Put a water 
wheel in the system, and we get 
power. 

Obviously there’s a flaw. If 
conservation holds, the water 
freezes pretty quick. Furthermore,

TKermodynaimcs says tfiat ener- 
gy to run tfie system will be 
greater tKan ffie maximum ener- 
gy to be obtained from tfie con-

Let’s replace tfie water witfi a 
ton of iron filings. Tfiat way we 
can close tfie wKole ssretem in a 
vacuum cBamber and stop wor- 
rying about atmospfieric friction, 
water evaporation and freezing 
of tfie water. We let tfie filings 
fall under gravity until tfie mass 
is a black stream, near absolute 
zero, moving at seven miles per 
second. Tfiafs nineteen minutes 
of operation. 

Now let it go anotfier nineteen 
minutes. Tfie velocity doubles, 
and we’ve let tfie filings fall tfie 
equivalent of twice tfie distance 
from infinity to tfie Earth’s sur- 
face. 

We could maintain tins acceler- 
ation forever, provided we do 
one thing. We will Have to build 
our system at tfie Nortfi (or 
South) Pole. Otlierwise tfie 
stream of filings will seem to 
bend away from tfie transmitter 
door as tfie Eartfi turns. 
(BOOM!) So we’re at tfie Nortfi 
Pole . 

In tliirty days tfie mass of tfie 
filings fias doubled. 

Note tfiat while Eartfi pulls 
tfie filings, tfie filings pull tfie 
EardL Minutely, at first. But tfie 
filings aren’t really going any- 
wfiere, so we Gave the equival-

ery montfi tfie tfirust doubles. If 
we run tfie S3rstem long enougfi 
tfie filings will weigfi as mucfi as

Obviously we don’t want ffiat. 
Tides! But in its present state, 
turning off tfie system would de- 
stroy tfie Eartfi. So we set up a 
second receiver at tfie Soutfi 
Pole. Tfie stream of filings goes 
tearing off tfirougfi tfie Eartfi’s 
atinospfiere, a blue flasfi of iron 
vapor ramming air. Even tfie

Wfiat a show! Listen to tfiat ap-

directors’ meeting was 
over, and the men who real- 
ly counted at Crosswell’s fast 
fled from Old Man Crosswell’s 
sombre presence and were pre- 
paring to jet tiome to various 
parts of Europe. 

Milo Priedor said to Hans 
Gustoffen as they moved down 
tfie corridor, “Thanks for the 
support in there, Hans.” 

“It got tricky for a moment, 
eh? It’s not just that we don’t 
need Zadar Smith World to han- 
dle our publicity any more,” 
Hans said, “but we got that creep 
Hicks fixed into the bargain.” 
“I rejoice! Not that I don’t 
admire Hicks, in a way.” 



“Oh, I like the man well 
enough ...” 

They realized Carshalton Hicks 
was just behind and talked 
about the new live synthetic 
flowers both were growing in 
their offices. 

Hicks took the scuttle to Lon- 
don, husbanding his wrath until 
he was in the presence of his third 
wife, Suomi, in their Kensington 
flat. 

“They’re crowding me again, 
scum like Priedor and Cox and 
Gustoffsen! They know I’ll make 
managing director in two years 
and they throw all the dirt they 
can.” 

Suomi was very black and 



147 



■i* :-r / . 

.v^ry voluptuous. The inside of 

her .mouth was an attractive pink 
when she laughed. , 

“Turn the tables on them, as 
you have done before, my love- 
pie!” 

“Know what they did? They 
got me to propose we shift our 
publicity account. They all want- 
ed it! So I did it. Then they left 
me out on a limb. Then Priedor 
moved that they accept my sug- - 
gestion and left it to me to break 
the news to Saul Betatrom.” 

She had been bom in a kraal. 
Every item of her husband’s 
manic world fascinated her. 
“Vino’s Saul Betatrom?” 

“The Zadar Smith' World guy 
handles all our advertising. I have 
to find him a parting present to 
soften the blow.” 

“Is that so hard?” 

, “What the devil do you give 
a guy like Betatrom? He already 
owns everything worth having.” 
Glimpse of pink again. “Give 
him something not worth hav- 
mg. 

“Just what I want to do, dar- 
ling — just so long as it looks 
.like it was well meant! This is a 
■ ticklish consignment. It has to be 
something people will think he 
' would go for but which he will 
hate like hell . '* 

“Leave it to me, love-pie. Your 
httle Suomi will think of some- 
thing. Meantime, how do you 
like my gown?" 

.148 



She statte^^ ^e ^phapng prpr 
cess, pressing tlie button -at her 
waist. Slowly, the glittering ma- 
terial of her dress began to turn 
transpajent. Beneath the dress, 
she wore only one other gar- 
ment. It also began to turn trans- 
parent. 

tCXT’eah,” said Saul Betatrom. 

* Some days, like today he 
didn’t think so fast So he said 
“yeah” again to fill the vacuum. 
That free-fall orgy at Danny’s 
place last night had about fin- 
ished him. 

The poisoned voice of Cox 
asked, “You get my meaning, 
Saul?” 

Betatrom fiddled with the dial 
on his phone, trying to get Cox’s 
face in better focus. 

“You calling from Crosswell’s, 
Sid?” 

“Of course I damned ain’t,” 
Cox said. “I’ll spell it out for 
you again, Saul. You’re all 
sluiced out with the Crosswell 
account, but good. Priedor and 
young Hicks have worked a deal 
with Gum Inc.” 

“Gum couldn’t advertise soap,” 
Saul said, the name of the rival 
agency rousing him slightly. 

“Gum just took over the pub- 
licity for Lawrence’s Life-Forms,” 
Cox reminded him. “Now there’s 
an account that’s going to esca- 
late for decades. These new syn- 
thetic-life animals they got . ; , ”

“Look, Sid, to hell with the 
natural history! Why didn’t you 
speak up for Zadar Smith World 
at the meeting?” 

“I was the only one wKo spoke 
for you, Saul, honest. I told the 
Old Man I was for you. I jeop- 
ardized my position.” 

Saul could see that happening. 
“So they plan to hand me the 
golden armchair, eh?” 

“Actual choice of gift is left 
to Carshalton Hicks, Saul. It may 
not be an armchair — ” 

Saul had switched off. 

TVTrs. Hicks — Suomi, the 
third and blackest Mrs. 
Hicks — leaned voluptuously 
across at Meconin and said, “You 
must enjoy handing big ac- 
counts.” 

Meconin scanned the sentence 
for double-meanings and said, 
“We are delighted to handle the 
Crosswell account.” Meconin was; 
the *m’ of Gum, the surviving, 
the triumphal initial; both ‘u’ 
and ‘G’ were back in the small- 
time where they belonged, where- 
as Meconin retired to His lunar 
estate every month, racing me- 
chanical horses roimd the flood- 
lit craters. He was a white, fu- 
sible, neutral-looking man and 
wore, this evening, a tinkling in- 
ertia suit. 

Hicks said to Meconin’s mis- 
tress, Merita, “It’s really cute, 
isn’t it?” 



She giggled. “Cute isn’t the 
word!” She didn’t attempt to say 
what was. 

Hearing that the best way to 
please Meconin was to delight 
his mistress, Hicks Had brought 
her one of the firm’s tapeworms 
in an environment jar. The ces- 
tode, anchored in a transparent 
gut, had had its metabolism 
speeded up. It went through its 
life cycle every two minutes, 
ovoid segments falling from it 
like snowflakes, dissolving in 
suitable nutrients into eggs, which 
changed into embryos as a cur- 
rent wafted them into another 
section of the jar. The embryos 
became active crawly creatares, 
and finally emerged into larval 
phases. These little bladder- 
worms, suckled in more swishing 
juices, turned miraculously into 
small tapeworms, and the whole 
process began again. Merita 
could not take Her pretty eyes 
off it. 

“It’s like an allegory of all 
life,” Meconin said sententiously, 
patting Merita’s hand and then 
turning back to moist little Mrs. 
Hicks. “You know, we also op- 
erate for Lawrence Life-Forms. 
There’s a revolution in our midst! 
One of the great success stories 
of our times. They could prob- 
ably make a ssmthetic tape- 
worm that would be even safer 
in the human gut than Cross- 
well’s are. Why, they are now

tyrannosaurus — that’s a sort of 
savage little prehistoric dino- 
saur — the world’s worst mam- 
mal ever — which’ we are going 
to launch in a month’s time with 
a big multi-million dollar cam- 
paign.” 

“They sound dangerous,” Su- 
omi said, looking at him with 
her mouth prettily open. 

“They only come knee-high, 
but they’re dangerous right 
enough. I wouldn’t want one.” 

“Well, guess we better get 
down to business. Mr. Meconin, 
since your time is valuable,” 
Hicks said. He was too busy 
worrying about the way Mecon- 
in looked at his wife to notice 
the abstracted way his wife was 
looking into space. 

Tt was two days later that Car- 
shalton Hicks jetted over to 
New York to present Saul Beta- 
trom with Crosswell Tapes’ fare- 
well gift to. Zadar Smith World. 
Suomi stayed home, elegant in 
her new diamond chastity belt. 
Hicks wore a mask — the plague 
was bad in the poor parts of 
New York again and, although 
everything was said to be under 
control, he wanted to take no 
risks. 

A couple of guys wheeled the 
large crate into Betatroms office. 
Betatrom was big this morning, 
dressed for the event, high-boots 



and larynx-amplifier and every- 
thing. He shook Hick’s hand with 
a reinfoiced' grip. 

The youngest member of the 
Crosswell board of directors said, 
without removing his mask, “Mr. 
Betatrom, although no words 
can express the §dmiration my 
firm — and, I may add, myself 
— feels for the capable and in- 
spired way in which you, through- 
out the past decade or more, 
have promoted — ” 

“Yeah, well, shag all that, 
Hicks,” Saul said. “What you 
got in that crate?” 

“This farewell gift comes from 
all of us — in which category I 
hasten to include myself — as a 
small — ” 

“Yeah, yeah, sure.” His voice 
filled the room. Not that he be- 
lieved current superstitions that 
hundred-decibel voices warded 
off the micro-organisms respon- 
sible for the plague, but it never 
hurt to play safe. 

He crossed to the crate, grab- 
bed the opener key, and wrench- 
ed. ' 

“ — very small, knee-high 
token — of how deeply we all 
feel ...” 

Hicks had taken the precau- 
tion of coming dressed in ar- 
mored pants. 

Scaly, ugly as a man in a mask, 
the tyrannosaur reared up on its 
hind legs, swished its tail, and 
jerked forward.

Saul Betatrom jetted behind 
his desk, yelling. 

/^Id Man Crosswell was laugH- 
ing. Tfie seemingly endless 
tears poured down his face. Across 
Eis desk from Him sat CarsHalton 
Hicks, face wreathed in smilles, at 
ease. Cox, Priedor, Gustoffen, 
stood by, puckering their faces 
into imitations of smirks. 

“Goddamnit, Betatrom can’t 
complain if the tryannosaur eats 
Him!” Crosswell wheezed. “It’s 
a real status symbol — the first 
t3U'annosaur Life-Forms released, 
and by the end of the year every- 
one will want one. So from Za- 
dar’s angle his present looks real 
good — even if their New York 
boy loses a limb! Hicks, you 
done a good job! Thank God 
someone has a sense of Humor 
round here.” 

He glared at the contorted 
faces of Cox and Co. 

“Well, you boys! Old Saul 
won’t be too too happy to re- 
ceive this little something from 
another of Gum’s big clients, will 
he? Specially if it eats him! What 
you say, Sid?” 

Cox said, “It’s not safe. I don’t 
see it’s so funny.” 

Sobering, the Old Man said 
dangerously, “Better ring him 
and tell him so, then, like you 
tell him everything going on Here, 
eh?” 

Priedor said hastily, “We all 
GREEKS BRINGING KNEE-HIGH GIFTS 



think Hicks did marvellously 
well, Mr. Crosswell. Betatrom 
Had gotten to be a menace, and 
it’s good to see his leg pulled — 
or maybe even eaten, like you 
say.” 

Just to infuriate Cox and Prie- 
dor, the Old Man got up, put His 
withered arm around Hick’s 
shoulders, and began to laugh 
again. 

And even if it wasn’t so damn- 
ed funny . he’d show His con- 
founded doctor tliat a good laugh 
now and again never hurt any- 
one . 

'T^he lackey at tfie front door of

Betatrom paced through tfie Hall

levis. 

He had his pet on a goad-

His ankles.

with its morning Labrador pup- 
py — a big Labrador kennel 
fiad been established on tfie es-

“This way, Suomi,” Betatrom 
growled, dragging tfie creature 
down tfie north drive. Cowed, it 
did as it was told. Already, tfie 
truth Had penetrated its pea-

“I’ll Have to go to tHe funeral,

on a bencK, dragged the dinosaur

Suomi sat there, showing fangs

Ke incident tiiat came to be 
associated witK tHe Cairo 
stone, as it was later called, stem- 
med largely from the peculiar 
fact that its l^al ownership wag 



in dispute from the moment it 
was discovered. This, in turn, was 
due to the fact that the expedition 
wfiicH found this strange object 
was a joint archeological venture 
on the part of the Soviet Union 
and the United States. The name 




153 



“Cairo stone,” of course, is gross- 
ly misleading, since tlie piece of 
smooth black rock in question 
was actually found in the diggings 
of an old quarry site some 2000 
miles west of Cairo. The joint ex- 
pedition was, in a way, a by- 
product of the cold war. Or at 
least of the scientific and cultural 
exchanges between the Soviet 
Union and the United States that 
were designed to foster a dStenie 
between the two great powers. 
But whatever the ultimate origin 
or the causes leading up to the 
finding of the stone, the plain 
fact was that it was fovmd by a 
team of American and Russian 
archeologists and that litigation 
over ownership of the stone began 
immediately at very high-diplo- 
matic levels between the two 
countries. 

The Cairo stone was a genuine 
archeological bomb shell. First 
off, there was never any ques- 
tion of its being a hoax, as is so 
often the case with inexplicable 
and totally unexpected discover- 
ies of this sort. At the very in- 
stant the digger’s pick first struck 
it, there must have been seven or 
eight American and Soviet scien- 
tists within 20 feet, with a French 
and Israeli archeologist thrown in 
to boot. To clinch matters, it was 
found some thirty feet down from 
the surface — thirty feet of dig- 
ging that had taken place over 
some three months within the 
154 



protective cocoon of the expedi- 
tion’s scientists. There was simply 
no possibility of a hoax, no way 
any one could Have gotten that 
stone down there short of Having 
placed it there some 5000 yearg 
ago; carbon 14 dating showed the 
stone to be at least that old. It 
had apparently been left, some 
time around 3000 B.C., at the site 
of an Egyptian stone quarry 
camp, the original and rather uni 
exciting target of the expedition. 

'^he Cairo stone would initial- 
ly have aroused no emotions 
had it not been for the enigmatic 
character of the markings on its 
smooth surface. Clearly the mark- 
ings were meant to record some- 
thing, to encode some kind of 
information, be it no more than 
a talley of some sort — number 
of oxen used in a certain period, 
number of months passed by the 
overseers or engineers at the site, 
or what Have you. So far, all 
right; nothing that would have at- 
tracted attention from outside a 
tight circle of scientists interested 
in just this sort of thing. But 
there was more. The markings on 
the stone, which consisted of 
nothing more than a number of 
lines of slanted strokes, had not 
been made by any of the usual 
methods characteristic of the 
third millennium B.C. and known 
to archeologists. That is, the 
slanted lines Had not been chip- 

GALAXY 



ped in by a chisel, dug in with an 
axiger, or produced by any other 
sort of craftmanship available to 
Mediterranean civilizations of 
tfie year 3000 B.C. They were ab- 
solutely uniform in length, width 
and direction of slant. A photo- 
graph to cut away the edges of 
the stone and thus eliminate the 
three-dimensional effect, looked 
exactly like a page of slant lines 
typed by an electric typewriter — 
uniform, evenly spaced, absolute- 
ly regular. 

The second peculiar thing 
about the Cairo Stone was its 
composition. It was thought at 
first that it was simply a natural 
piece of obsidian, perhaps worn 
smooth by natural processes, and 
simply used as a tablet by the 
person or persons who had writ- 
ten on it. But this proved wrong. 
The smooth black rock was not 
obsidian, although it had some of 
the properties of obsidian, which 
it resembled in many respects. 
Inexplicably, however, it defied 
classification. No geologist was 
able to pigeon-hole it as such 
and such a type of rock. Oh, I 
don’t mean there was anything 
ultimately unknowable about it. 
Laboratory analysis revealed its 
chemical make-up easily enough 
— mostly silicon. It might very 
well have been a piece of meteor- 
ite. But the uniform texture of it 
gave the suggestion that it was an 
artifact, that it Had been manu- 
GODEL NUMBERS 



factored, not just discovered in 
nature. Certainly its original own- 
er had not just found it lying 
about, as it were, on the floor of 
the Egyptian desert, unless it had 
been a meteorite. But even if a 
meteorite, there was still the pe- 
culiar homogeneity and the re- 
markably even top surface — the 
surface with the slant marks on 
it — to be accounted for. All in 
all, the Cairo stone just did not 
fit in with what we know of the 
technology and craftmanship of 
the Nile valley civilization of the 
third millennium before Christ. 

II 

M y name is Matthew Hamil- 
fon, and I teach mathema- 
tical logic at State University. 
You are wondering how a logician 
came to be mixed up with a piece 
of stone covered with some 
strange and baffling markings. 
That’s easy enough to answer. 
The head of the American com- 
ponent of the joint expedition 
that had discovered the Cairo 
stone is a distinguished archeolo- 
gist from State University. And 
in addition to being an archeolo- 
gist and distinguished, he is 
tough. Largely due to his stub- 
born efforts, the stone was 
brought back, pending the result 
of the high level Soviet-American 
negotiations, to State University. 
It was promptly locked up in the 

155 



laboratory of the head of the de- 
partment of geophysics, Isodore 
Wolfe, who was to conduct the 
chemical and spectroscopic tests 
to determine its molecular struc- 
ture. Now it turns out that Isi- 
dore Wolfe is one of my closest 
friends, all of whicH is by way 
of explanation of my involve- 
ment with the Cairo stone. 

The stone had been found in 
March of this year, and now, by 
midsummer, after some peregrin- 
ations to the Smithsonian and 
elsewhere, had finally been bed- 
ded in Isi’s laboratory. That had 
been sometime in April. The 
events that I am going to tell 
about began sometime in the mid- 
dle of July. It had been an ex- 
cessively hot day, and as I had 
nothing pressing to do — I never 
teach in the summer unless my 
department-head virtually or- 
ders me to do so — I had spent 
the morning looking through a 
very elegant new version of Co- 
hen’s proof of the independence 
of the axiom of choice, sent to 
me in manuscript version by a 
colleague at Rice University, and 
in the afternoon I had worked 
on a variant of Turing machines 
that I had been tinkering with 
the last couple of weeks, a variant 
in which state symbols are elimin- 
ated in favor of print instructions, 
and change of direction instruc- 
tions eliminated altogether by 
means of a circular tape. But it 
156 



was mostly a half-hearted effort 
in the shimmering of un-air-con- 
ditioned heat of the tiny cubicle 
that I call my office, and I had 
not been able to prove the result 
I had been trying for. Still, it was 
absorbing work, and the hours 
somehow slipped by until I was 
surprised to hear the clock on the 
old chapel building ring out nine 
p.m. At just about that tim'= I 
heard a knock at my door, and 
Isidore Wolfe unceremoniously 
ushered himself in without wait- 
ing for a reply. 

“Still trying for the big result 
in effective . computability,” he 
said, picking up and laying down 
one of the symbol-filled scratch 
sheets of paper on my desk, 

“Big result!” I flung back in 
mock anger. “My last thrilling 
theorem was the big result of the 
second half of the century. What 
do you expect from me? Two 
strokes of genius in one lifetime?” 
Actually, my last theorem had 
been only a modest addition to 
the theory of effective computa- 
bility, but the proof was rather 
intricate and original, and I was 
inordinately proud of it. I always 
pretended to Isi that I was the 
Godel of the second half of the 
twentieth century. Keep that in 
mind. It will come up again la- 
ter, 

Tsi settled down with a cigar, 
and I lighted my pipe, and we 
GALAXY 



proceeded thoroughly to pollute 
the atmosphere of my tiny of- 
fice. We talked idly to no great 
purpose, for it was summer and 
Kot and lazy-like — but getting 
bearable now that the sun Kad 
gone down — and we both felt 
relaxed and ready for gossip and 
light badinage. Isi talked first, 
about the current in-fighting and 
jockeying for position in his own 
department and blasted off steam 
at a couple of his colleagues with 
some juicy epithets — Yiddish 
and English. I let him go on until 
he felt better. After a while he 
turned to his latest efforts to an- 
alyze the composition of the Cai- 
ro stone — they had not revealed 
much beyond the fact that the 
crystal structure of the material 
comprising the stone was one the 
geologists and physicists who were 
working with it had never run 
across before, except when pro- 
duced under artificial laboratory 
conditions of enormous pressure 
and temperature. Again, it ap- 
peared that the stone was some- 
thing of an artifact, not a natural 
piece of rock. But if it took huge 
pressure chambers and modern 
ovens to produce that sort of 
crystalline structure in 1968, How 
the devil did it get produced in 
3000 B.C.? Neither Isi nor I could 
offer an adequate hypothesis re- 
garding the origin of the stone, 
much less of the peculiarly uni- 
form markings on it. We had just 
GODEL NUMBERS 



turned to the subject of the mark- 
ings when somebody tapped on 
the door. 

It was our mutual friend, 
Chester Wu, of the Computer 
Science department. He wedged 
his way into the office, sat down 
on the sole remaining chair, and 
went through an exaggerated imi- 
tation of a man choking to death 
on poison gas. So we left the 
door open in order to clear out 
some of the pipe and cigar smoke, 
and we continued our desultory 
but nonetheless enjoyable con- 
versation, with Chester joining in. 

Let me admit right here that 
Chester, Isi and I make up 
a strangely assorted trio. I sup- 
pose the fact that we are all three 
unmarried Has something to do 
with our being close friends. Isi 
was divorced, and Chester and I 
had never got beyond the affair 
stage. At any rate, we spent a 
good number of our leisure Hours 
together — playing chess, listen- 
ing to chamber music live or can- 
ned, cooking up^elaborate Italian 
diimers in one of our apartments, 
but mostly talking. Our back- 
groxmds were widely diverse, so 
much so that we were almost al- 
ways a source of novelty to one 
another — a factor which no 
doubt contributed to our friend- 
ship. 

I sidore Wolfe was a New York- 
er, a Jew, and a product of 

157 



big city schools — B.A. from 
wKat was then City College, PK. 
D. from Columbia. He was in His 
early forties, fairly recently di- 
vorced, no cKildren. His five-year 
marriage was a never-ending 
source of Hilariously funny stor- 
ies witfi wKicH He kept CHester 
and me constantly in stitcKes. 
AltRougH He Had been profound- 
ly incompatible vntfl His wife, I 
gatiSered' tfiat His marriage Had 
been a ratfier exciting sort of 
tKing, in tHe sense ifflat one big 
five-year-long figHt could Hard- 
ly be dull. 

But He was mucH better off 
out of it and knew it. In fact, it 
seemed tHat He was always just 
realizing How fortunate He was 
to be free, and enjoying tHe ec- 
stasy of relief, as it were, for tHe 
first time. 

CHester Wu was only a young- 
ster, in Es mid-twenties, Having 
just completed Es PH. D. at tHe 
California Institute of TecHnolo- 
gy, after a B.A. at U.C.L.A. He 
was an Assistant Professor in tHe 
department of Computer Science, 
and quite possibly ffie most bril- 
liant young faculty member at 
State University. His parents 
were botH CEinese Americans, 
and altHougfi He was fluent in 
CEnese, He was tHorougKly 
Americanized and spoke collo- 
quial EnglisH witHout tHe trace 
of an accent. If you want a good 
picture of How CHester looked 
158 



and acted, just think of Jimmy 
Chan — Number One Son — 
in tHe old CKarUe Cfian moTries. 
CHester was conscious of tEs re- 
semblance, and it amused Hina 
no end. He even went so far as to 
interpolate pseudo-CEinese prov- 
erHs into His conversation, prov- 
erbs wEcH He claimed to Have 
learned from His “fatfier,” In- 
spector CHan. He and I sHared 
a number of interests in common, 
tHere being no small overlap be- 
tween matEematical logic and 
computer science. We were botS 
interested in recursive function 
tEeory, information theory, set 
tHeory (in a dilettantisH way), 
and artificial intelligence — not 
to mention a common interest in 
riie great S. S. Van Dine mystery 
stories witH tHat remarkable fic- 
tional detective, PElo Vance. 

As for myself, tfiere is less to 
say, and nothing at all exotic to 
relate. I am a typical Wasp, an 
Associate Professor of PElosopHy 
at State, and a product of decent 
undergraduate training in matH- 
ematics at Indiana, topped vntH 
an Ivy League PS.D. in pEIoso- 
pHy, most all my work Having 
been in matEematical logic. I do 
teacH two fairly esoteric and tecH- 
nical graduate seminars in pElos- 
opry. However, one in pElosopHy 
of language, tHe otHer in tEe pHil- 
osopHy of science. 

But so mucH about our back- 
groimds.

CC/^ne thing for sure,” Isi said, 
'^sticking out a dogmatic 
neck. “There can’t be much of 
importance in any language that 
you can get by writing down a 
bunch of slant marks over and 
over again. That might be a good 
way for the felahin to count th'eir 
wives or sheep, but it sure as Kell 
won’t serve for anything more so- 
phisticated.” 

This wasn’t entirely true, and 
Chester and I brought the axe 
down on Isi. It is a truism of In- 
formation Theory that the 
amount of information tran- 
scribed in any form is a function 
of prior knowledge on the part of 
the recipient of the information, 
and not solely of the medium in 
which the information is tran- 
scribed. Thus, if you have pre- 
viously memorized the Encyclo- 
pedia Brittanica, a very simple 
message from me to you, consist- 
ing of a volume and a page num- 
ber, will quite possibly suffice to 
convey an enormous amount of 
information. “And if there aren’t 
any prior conventions agreed up- 
on between sender and receiver,” 
Chester concluded this argument, 
“then there can’t be any message 
sent. Not that sender and receiv- 
er actually have to get together 
beforehand and agree on the con- 
ventions. The receiver can even 
attempt to deduce the conven- 
tions from the message, then ret- 
roactively agree to them, reading 
GODEL NUMBERS 



back into the coded message. 
But there must be a set of con- 
ventions, some set or other, on 
which the code is based.” 

“And that’s what we would be 
doing if we assumed the marks 
on the stone were a record, or 
tally, say, of the number of oxen 
used on successive months in the 
stone quarry,” I joined in. 

“Which is probably just the 
sort of thing that the jerks who 
wrote on the stone Had in mind,” 
Isi added dourly. 

The conversation continued in 
this vein for perhaps Half an hour 
longer. For some reason, we could 
not seem to get our minds off 
the topic of the Cairo stone. In 
some unexplained way, it seemed 
to all three of us that there was 
something unnatural, something 
terribly incongruous about the 
stone, and in particular about the 
fact that it did not fit into any 
rational explanation that we 
might try to offer. Fantastic 
thoughts unspoken by any of us, 
lurked in the background of our 
conversation — thoughts about 
the evidence for the existence of 
an intelligence inconunensurate 
with anything contemporary His- 
tory knew about the Egypt of 
five thousand years ago. 

A lull came over the conversa- 
tion tq be broken hy Chester. 
“Good Lord! Do you know that 
neither Matty not I have ever 

159 



seen this flipping rock. Here we 
are beating our gums about some- 
thing that we have never laid 
eyes on, but which is only a five- 
minute walk from where we are 
sitting.” 

“Let’s go,” said Isi, getting up 
with unexpected vigor. “I Have 
my lab key with me. You guys 
can look at it as long as you want, 
and maybe you’ll be able to tell 
me how the damned thing was 
made.” 

It was cooler as we stepped 
out of the office building, and a 
fresh breeze Had sprung up to 
make the summer night quite 
agreeable. It was early yet, no 
later than ten o’clock, and there 
was still quite a bit of activity 
and bustle on the campus, espe- 
cially student couples walking 
together slowly, hand in Hand, 
absorbed and lost in one anoth- 
er. We took our time strolling 
past the pond, past the student 
union and between the Chemistry 
building, identifiable by the,char- 
acteristic odors emanating from 
it, and the theatre building, where 
some sort of rehearsal was going 
on. After about five minutes we 
came to the massive new geophy- 
sics tower where Isi Had His of- 
fice and His laboratory. The 
building — it was called tKe Wil- 
lard Gibbs Geophysical Labor- 
atories — belonged to the genre 
of the new architecture — all 
glass, no ivy. I like that kind of 
160 



building for physics laboratories, 
theatre centers, and b^avioral 
science buildings, but I am old- 
fashioned enough to prefer the 
Eiunanities to be lodged in old, 
High-ceilinged, red brick, ivy-cov- 
ered buildings. The humanities 
need a certain mustiness in order 
to feel comfortable. 

Isi unlocked the buUding door, 
and we stepped into the entrance 
hall where a myriad of glass cases, 
containing various exhibits of 
minerals, meteorites, soil samples, 
etc., were on display along the 
walls. There was stUl some activ- 
ity in the building, with lights on 
in a number of offices and labor- 
atories. 

Since authorized personnel 
all Had their own building 
and laboratory keys, work con- 
tinued around the clock in this 
and the other science buildings on 
the campus. I suppose this is the 
usual sort of thing everywhere 
science is done; experiments just 
don’t terminate tHemsejlves at 
5:00 p.m. on week days. 

Ill 

W e took the elevator up to the 
third floor, where Isi’s 
laboratory was located. The build- 
ing was air-conditioned — one of 
the few air-conditioned refuges 
on our campus — and felt almost 
cold by comparison with the air 
outside. On leaving the elevator 

GALAXY 



we flowed a wide corridor 
straigHt in front of us, on botH 
sides of wEicR were doors to lab- 
oratories. About midway down 
tfie corridor we Halted, and Isi 
started to put Hi$ key in tHe lock 
of tfie door to laboratory 314, His 
own private laboratory, tfien sudi 
denly stopped. We could distinct- 
ly Hear voices coming from tHe 
otfier side of tfie door. Isi turned 
to us quizzically. His Head cock- 
ed expectantly to one side, and 
His finger on His lips admonisfiing 
us to remain quiet. We listened 
motionlessly, our Heads inclined 
toward tHe door. 

“I tfiink I fiear a woman and 
two men,” Cfiester wHispered af- 
ter about two minutes of almost 
breatfiless silence on our part. 
I confirmed tfiis by nodding. 
Clearly one of tfie voices was tfiat 
of a woman, wfiUe tfie otfiers — 
it sounded like two — were men’s 
voices. One was deep, mellifluous, 
and resonant; tfie otfier was also 
a baritone, deeper tfian tfie aver- 
age, but not pitcfied quite so low 
as tfie dominant male voice. 

“Well, damn it, tfiis can’t go 
go on forever,” Isi said witfi de- 
termination, unlocking tfie door 
and pusHing it open in one quick 
motion. Cfiester, Isi, and I all 
entered tHe laboratory in a con- 
certed mov«nent and drew up 
still just inride tiie door. Tfie 
tfiree'persbns already in tfie room 
— two men and a very young 
GODa NUMBERS 



woman, as w^ Had divined from 
tHe sound of tfieir voices — stop- 
ped 'tfieir conversaticHX abruptly, 
and stood awkwardly at tfie lab- 
oratory bencfi near wfficfi tfiey 
fiad been standing wfien we en- 
tered. A drawer in tfie bencfi was 
open, and a smootfi black ob- 
ject, about tfie size and rougfily 
tfie sfiape of a large encyclopedia, 
was clearly visible in tfie drawer. 
I knew, almost intuitively, tfiat 
wfiat tfie intruders fiad been look- 
ing at was tfie Cairo stone. 

iTwo of tfie miexpected guests 
in tfie laboratory were known to 
all tfiree of us, and tfie tfiird, ft 
turned out later, to one of us. 
One of tfie men, a fieavy-set and 
very Handsome cBap witfi com- 
pletely silver Bair, worn long 
and combed strai^t back from 
fiis forefiead, was immediately 
recognized by all of us as Anton 
Pokro^rekoe, tfie emin&it Rusrian 
ant&opologist wfio Bad Headed 
tfie Soviet contingent of tfie joint 
AmCTican-Russian expedition tfiat 
fiad turned up tfie Cairo stone. 
Tfie young lady we also recog- 
nized as Rebecca Hale, Iri’s lab- 
oratory assistant and a Pfi. H. 
candidate in geoptiysics. Sfie was 
visibly and painfully embsurassed', 
Having turned about n degrees 
wfiiter upon our entrance. Not so 
Pokrovskoe. 

(tjt is so good to see you again. 
Dr. Wolfe,” fie said, iden- 

161 



tifying himself as the resonant 
bass voice that we had heard from 
the other side of the door. “Please 
forgive us if we seem to be in- 
truding, but Miss Hale, who Has? 
been our so gracious hostess this 
evening, asured us that you had 
finished y9ur work in the labor- 
atory for today, and: that we 
would not be intruding. AH yes, 
Professor Hamilton, it is good to 
see you again as well.” I nodded 
my Head in acknowledgment of 
the greeting — I Had met Pokrov- 
skoe briefly at a reception in 
Honor of tKe joint expedition on 
the occasion of ifie return of tHe 
American scientists to State Uni- 
versity — and turned to see wKat 
Isi would say and do. 

He Had not lost His aplomb in 
wHat was an obviously embar- 
rassing situation for all of us, but 
advanced calmly and shook tfie 
Russian’s proffered Hand as if 
the situation were tHe most na- 
tural in all possible worlds. He 
then introduced CEester to tKe 
Russian antHropologist,‘wfiom He 
knew by sight but Had never met. 
Pokrovskoe in turn introduced 
the other man to us. 

“Please allow me to present to 
you Mr. Nicholas Kurlov, attacK§ 
to the Russian embassy in Wasfi- 
ington. He is an old and good 
friend of my family, and fie is vis- 
iting us before returning sHortly 
to our country.” Pokrovskoe’s 
voice was not only mellifluous, it 
162 



was oily and insincere as weU. 

Kurlov shook hands formally 
with the three of us. Hesitating 
briefly as Ke was introduced to 
Chester, as if fie knew him. Ches- 
ter, who Had spent a post-doctoral 
year at Dubna, studying and 
working witfi tfie giant computer 
recently installed there for tfie 
Joint Institute for Nuclear Re- 
searcR, mumbled something in 
Russian to Kurlov that neither 
Isi nor I understood. It was, to 
say tfie least, a fantastically awk- 
ward situation. But tfie two Rus- 
sians, overdressed as Russians 
seem to be to Americans — in- 
credibly diey both wore dark 
wool suits, sfiirts and ties in tfie 
middle of summer — played out 
tfie game as if nothing out of tfie 
way Rad fiappened, wfiile tfie 
Rapless Miss Hale agomzed 
speeclilessly without having once 
moved from tfie spot wfiere we 
first saw fier upon entering the 
laBoratory. 

Wfiat fiad Happened was oH- 
vious, of course. THe two Rus- 
sians, distinguisfied and exuding 
prestige, Had overwfielmed tfie 
impressionable little Rebecca 
Hale into allowing tfiem to ac- 
company fier to Isi’s laboratory. 
Sfie was autfiorized to be tfiere, 
to be sure, and fiad building and 
laboratory keys ifiat allowed Her 
access at any time. But for a 
laboratory assistant to allow un-* 
autfiorized personnel access to the 

GALAXY 



department chairman’s labora- 
tory, regardless of Kow silver- 
Haired and eminent they might 
be, was sufficient reason for dis- 
missal. And she knew it. 

^T^fie awkward situation did not 
I last long, however, for after 
iBome Samenities and another 
round of handshakes, European 
style, the two Russians departed 
as if nothing irregular Had oc- 
curred. Isi took the now trem- 
bling Miss Hale aside for a few 
words, after which she left the 
laboratory stiffly and white-faced, 
looking like a zombie. 

“I chewed her out good and 
proper,” Isi pronounced with 
menace once the three of us were 
alone again. “I’ll let her stew in 
her own juices for a couple of 
days before I tell her that I won’t 
press disciplinary action.” Isi 
talked tough, but at Heart was as 
gentle as they come. “But damn 
it all, I don’t like this. She told 
me that they had been here about 
half an hour. During that time, 
Pokrovskoe just Happened to re- 
member that he had left his at- 
tache case on the seat of the car 
in whi(fi they had come, and that 
it contained valuable papers, and 
that the car was unlocked, and 
would you, please. Miss Hale, 
be so very good as to return to 
the car and lock it. That must 
have given Pokrovskoe and Kur- 
lov at least ten minutes alone in 
GODEL NUMBERS 



my lab. By the way, did you 
smell their breaths? The Vodka 
vapor they exhaled nearly gave 
me a jag. Including my faithful 
Rebecca. That was part of their 
non-sexual seduction of the poor 
dumb child.” 

When Isi had finished speak- 
ing, we suddenly remembered 
that our original purpose of com- 
ing to the laboratory was to see 
the Cairo stone. And there it was. 
Isi picked it out of the drawer 
and carefully laid it on the labor- 
atory bench, where the light was 
better. The stone was smooth on 
ils surface, save for the inscrip- 
tions, roughly rectangular in 
shape but with rounded edges, 
uniformly black — the darkest 
black, I believe, that I have ever 
seen — and weighed about four 
poxmds. The inscriptions on the 
surface consisted of nine rows of 
slanted lines of absolutely uni- 
form length, the rows varying 
However with respect to the num- 
ber of lines they contained. Two 
of tiie rows were indented an even 
space, about Half an inch, almost 
exactly like the indentation for a 
paragraph on a printed page. The 
effect the stone had on me was 
singular. Knowing it Had been 
fotmd among other artifadts m an 
excavation that bore the date 
3000 B.C., I could not overcome 
the impression that it was in some 
way alien to ever 3 dhmg that re- 
corded history Has told us. 

163 



W • •“Whaf'S on the bottom side?” 
Chester asked. 

“Nothing,” , Isi replied. “It’s 
.</ just like this side, but without 
the inscriptions. Smooth, except 
for a little piece we drilled out for 
analysis. Here, I’ll turn it over 
and show you.” 

T he opposite side of the Cairo 
stone was not uniformly 
smooth. Almost so, but not quite; 
there was a small chip in the 
bottom right Hand comer of it. 
Otherwise, the surface was as flat 
and uniform as the top side. But 
something was wrong. Isi was vis- 
ibly perturbed. 

“.That wasn’t there this morn- 
ing, goddamn it. Not that size. 



anywn^,” I?i growled. “We had 
taken out a little piece, about a 
cubic inch, in just that spot, for 
chemical and spectroscopic analy- 
sis. But the hole is bigger now, 
by twice the size. And what has 
been taken out was not drilled 
out, but crudely chipped out with 
what must have been a small 
geologist’s pick. It was Pokrov- 
skoe and Kurlov; I know it. I 
feel like calling Washington and 
having those two sneak thieves 
kicked out of the coimtry.” 

“It wouldn’t do any good,” I 
interrupted in what I thought 
was a soothing voice. “Besides, 
you can scarcely prove anything. 
You know that the hole is slight- 
ly larger than it was^ but that’s

hardly firm evidence. And don’t 
forget that during the day there 
are a lot of people working with 
you in this laboratory, and you 
occasionally step out for coffee. 
There is no use flsnng off half- 
cocked calling people in Wash- 
ington. Come on, let’s get out of 
here and have a drink.” 

This suggestion met a warm re- 
sponse, and a half an hour later 
we were settled down with 'mar- 
tinis in a cool lounge — one of 
the three, and the only decent 
one to be found in the small, al- 
most rural little town where 
State University is located. The 
martinis before us constituted a 
second round — we had tossed 
the first one off quickly — and 
Isi had cooled off a bit, although 
he was still pretty hot under the 
collar about the invasion of his 
laboratory and the theft of a 
piece of the stone. 

Remembering now that Chester 
had said something to Kurlov in 
Russian, I asked him what it Had 
been. 

“I told him I was glad to see 
Him again,” Chester replied, ob- 
viously relishing the fact that he 
Had some information up his 
sleeve we did not know about. 

“Then you have met that damn 
attache before,” Isi exploded in a 
tone that suggested that more ac- 
quaintance with Kurlov on Ches- 
ter’s part implied guilt by asso- 
ciation of some sort. 



165 



t C A ttache, schmattache,” Ches- 
ter returned wryly, with a 
Wolfe-like imitative shrug of his 
shoulders. Chester had the Clever 
habit of picking up Isi’s Yiddish 
interpolations, and this sort of 
expression — so utterly incon- 
gruous coming from a young 
Chinese-American — was ordin- 
arily a source of much hilarity to 
Isi. But at the moment he was 
in no mood for laughter. 

‘What the devil do you mean, 
Chester?” 

“I mean that Kurlov is no at- 
tach6 to the Russian embassy in 
Washington. I knew him at the 
Institute at Dubna. He is one of 
the top-notch Soviet computer 
scientists. It was he who was in 
charge of the installation of their 
big new computer there. And 
what he is doing in this country, 
I don’t know. Earlier this week 
a colleague in my department 
who had just flown back from 
Dubna told me that he had seen 
Kurlov there. So he has just fresh- 
ly arrived in the States, of that 
we can be sure.” 

“But why did Pokrovskoe lie to 
us, and introduce Kurlov as an 
attach6” I mused more to my- 
self than to the others. 

“Maybe to cover up the fact — 

I guess it is a fact — that he 
flew over to this country on short 
notice just to see the Cairo stone,” 
Chester-replied. “But why should 
a computer expert want to look 
166 



at an old rock? One thing for 
sure, we need some more nourish- 
ment to figure this thing out.” 
And he held up three fingers to 
the waiter to indicate another 
round of martinis. 

“Pokrovskoe or any other 
damned amateur could have 
hacked out that chip from the 
stone,” Isi said as the bartender 
brought three fresh drinks. “You 
certainly don’t need a computer 
specialist for a schoolboy trick 
like that. Well, they have a piece 
of the stone now, and that’s that. 
They might as well have the 
whole damn thing, since x-ray 
analysis indicates the material in 
the stone is homogeneous. If you 
know what a piece of it is made 
of and how it was made, you 
know about the stone.” 

“All there is,” Chester echoed. 
And I could see that there was 
something troubling him — some- 
thing that was perhaps buried be- 
low the surface of his mind. Lat- 
er we were to learn that what was 
at the back of Chester’s mind 
at that moment would turn out to 
be the solution to the enigma of 
the Cairo stone, 

IV 

A week later found the explana- 
tion of the anomalies con- 
cerning the Cairo stone little ad- 
vanced. Isi and his associates were 
continuing their analyses, but 

GALAXY 



with little evident progress. The 
mystery of the nature of the stone 
liad even grown more complex, if 
an 3 rthing; for chemical analysis 
had shown that it had some rath- 
er remarkable properties not hith- 
erto suspected. Among them was 
the stone’s ability to withstand 
the corrosive effects of the most 
powerful acids known to contem- 
porary science. It was as if the 
stone had actually been designed 
to last for untold centuries — 
forever, even — once it was aban- 
doned to the state of nature. Isi 
estimated that it was well-nigh 
indestructible and could endure 
the eroding effects of the elements 
not merely for hundreds and 
thousands, but for millions of 
years — or at least as long as the 
earth endured. Proof of design? 
The evidence was becoming more 
comp>elling with every passing 
day. 

As a special precaution against 
a repetition of the intrusion by 
Kurlov and Pokrovskoe, a special 
lock had been installed on the 
door of Isi’s laboratory and a pair 
of night watchmen armed with 
revolvers had been assigned in 
shifts to remain in the laboratory 
from the time it was locked up 
in the late afternoon until Isi 
arrived to begin work early the 
next morning. 

As I said, an imeventful week 
had slipped by, and another hot 
July evening found Chester, Isi 
GODEL NUMBERS 



and myself assembled in Ches- 
ter s office in the Computer Sci- 
ence building. This, like the geo- 
physics building, was one of the 
new structures on the compus; 
and housing the Control Data 
3600 as it did, it had to be air- 
conditioned. Human beings and 
faculty members can endure the 
sweltering summer without com- 
fort at public universities, but not 
expensive giant computers. We 
were quite comfortable, relaxed 
and generally in an expansive 
mood after a satisfying dinner at 
Mario’s, a new ItaHan restaurant 
that had opened off of the main 
highway to the capital, not too 
far from the campus. Moreover, 
we were enjoying the pleasant an- 
ticipation of a rather important 
occasion; we were among those 
invited to a cocktail party at 
nine o’clock at the Faculty Club 
in honor of the people connected 
with the joint expedition that had 
imearthed the Cairo stone. The 
earlier affair, where I had origin- 
ally met Pokrovskoe, had been a 
drab little thing of sherry, cheese 
and crackers, organized by the 
anthropology department. But 
this would be the big one. The 
host woxild be Dean Ortcutt of 
the College of Arts and Sciences. 
Pokrovskoe would be there, of 
course, as one of the honorees, 
and most surely protocol would 
include his guest Kurlov among 
the invited. It was only eigHt- 

167 



thirty, so we had half an hour or 
so to kill before starting over to 
the Faculty Club where the af- 
fair was to be held. We had fin- 
ished swapping opinions on the 
character of the two Russians — 
negative for Pokrovskoe and pos- 
itive for Kurlov — and the con- 
versation Had trailed off. It was 
at this point that I blurted out 
what had; been on all our minds, 
unspoken and perhaps just be- 
low the conscious threshold for 
the last week. 

CCT ook,” I said, “let’s be frank 
with ourselves and say 
aloud what we Have all been more 
or less thinking. That damned 
piece of black rock is the product 
of EigH technology, of an intelli- 
gence or civilization that could 
not have existed at the time the 
forefathers of the iellahin were 
quarrying granite in the desert 
outside of Cairo.” I looked to 
Isi for confirmation, for I knew 
intuitively that he felt as I did. 

“That’s right, more than 
right,” he nodded. “The stone is 
definitely an artifact, and I’m not 
referring just to those crazy marks 
on it. I mean the substance of the 
stone itself. It is definitely not 
a mineral made in some kind of 
Idln, imder fantastic conditions 
of Heat and pressure. It resists the 
action of the most powerful acids 
and solvents that we can apply to 
it. And here’s the clincher. I am 
163 



beginning to doubt whether we 
have the technology, as of July 
1968, to synthesize that sort of 
material ourselves.” 

“But further analysis of the 
stone might reveal something 
about the technology responsible 
for producing it, don’t you think, 
Isi?” Chester asked. 

“Yes, most certainly. And that 
is what disturbs me about the 
Russians getting Hold of a piece 
of the stone,” Isi replied. “It’s 
beginning to appear that this pre- 
sumably inoffensive archeological 
discovery could Have locked into 
it information concerning a kind 
of technology advanced far be- 
yond our own. Slowly but surely 
laboratory analysis will unseal 
that information. And the im- 
pact on science as we know it 
could be enormous.” 

“Information,” Chester mur- 
mured almost to himself. “It’s 
the information.” 

Something was still bothering 
Chester — that idea that had oc- 
curred to him at the lounge Had 
apparently not stopped gnawing 
at the back of His mind. But he 
volunteered nothing further, and 
we let the subject of the Cairo 
stone lapse. After a few minutes 
devoted to the pennant hopes 
of the Red Sox — dismal, we 
concluded — we noticed that it 
was after nine o’clock and left 
Chester’s office for the Faculty 
Club. It was only a seven-minute 

GALAXY 



walk from the Computer Science 
Center, so we scarcely had time 
to get rumpled in the heat before 
entering the sanctuary of air-con- 
ditioning again. Incidentally, in 
case it sounds from what I have 
been sa 3 dng as if State University 
is comfortable in the summer, let 
me assure you that I have ex- 
hausted the inventory of air-con- 
ditioned buildings on the campus. 

T^verybody who was anybody 
was at the reception, or 
cocktail party, or whatever you 
want to call it — the President of 
the University in all his dignity, 
the Provost, various Deans, De- 
partment Heads, distinguished 
Egyptologists, anthropo 1 o g i s t s 
and what have you, both from 
State and from other institutions, 
some of them sufficiently far 
away to involve an over-night 
stopover. Big time! It was a real 
bash, all right. The spirits were 
flowing from a well-stocked bar 
behind which three barmen — ac- 
tually they were graduate students 
in white jackets, picking up a 
little cash — were industriously 
popping corks, shaking mixers, 
and pouring very professional 
looking libations. There were sev- 
eral tables laden with hors- 
d’oeuvres, including caviar — 
but only domestic — in honor, no 
doubt, of Pokrovskoe and the 
other Soviet members of the Cairo 
stone expedition. Indeed, we im- 
GODEL NUMBERS 



mediately spotted the Russian 
scientist, glass in hand and his 
colleague Kurlov at his side, be- 
fore the largest of the tables of 
food. There were three other men 
with him, quite Slavic looking, 
younger than either Pokrovskoe 
or Kurlov, and obviously not aca- 
demic types. One of them Had a 
small but noticeable scar over his 
left eye. We had seen none of 
them before, and, knowing the 
Soviet members of the expedi- 
tion at least by sight, we were 
able to exclude that explanation 
for their presence. Although I 
hate to say it — it sounds so 
“gothically” melodramatic — 
there appeared to be something 
sinister about those three unsmil- 
ing and strange faces. But our at- 
tention was soon enough diverted 
from them, as Dean Ortcutt made 
his way through the throng and 
welcomed Isi, wHo had twisted 
the good Dean’s arm to get in- 
vitations for Chester and myself 
to the reception. Isi, as prestigious 
head of one of the most important 
departments at the University, 
was part of its power structure, 
to use the current jargon of the 
civil rights movement. Chester 
and I, although respected for our 
scholarship, definitely were not. 



'^he Dean steered us over to 
the bar, where Isi and I set- 
tled for our usual martinis, and 
Chester experimented with a 

169 



stinger. While Isi and Ortcutt im- 
mersed themselves in a discus- 
sion of campus politics — most of 
which, incidentally, is carried on 
at informal meetings of this sort — 
Chester and I wormed our way 
through the press of bodies and 
elbows to the table of hors- 
d’oeuvres where, upon entering, 
we had seen Pokrovskoe. He was 
still there, with Kurlov and the 
three unsavory looking ones. They 
were all speaking Russian, which 
confirmed our assumption that 
the three newcomers were coun- 
trymen of the two Soviet scien- 
tists. Chester and I helped our- 
selves to the tempting canapes. 
It was Kurlov, and not Pokrov- 
skoe, who noticed us first. 

“My good Professor Wu,” he 
said with genuine warmth, “it is 
my good fortune to see you again. 
I have cordial greetings for you 
in recent letters from my col- 
leagues of the Institute at Dubna. 
They remember well, and with 
pleasure, your sabbatical year 
with us.” It was obvious that he 
was no longer trying to pass him- 
self off as an embassy attache. 
It would have been useless, any- 
way since Chester recognized him. 

Pokrovskoe now turned to us 
and greeted us with elaborate 
cordiality, but not with evident 
sincerity with which Kurlov Had 
met Chester. After the usual 
amenities, during which he did 
not introduce us to his three iden- 
170 



tical looking comrades — they 
hovered awkwardly in the back- 
ground, just a few steps away 
from their coxmtrymen — Pok- 
rovskoe turned to the subject of 
the Cairo stone. There is real 
chutzpah, I thought to myself; 
he should show some scintilla of 
embarrassment regarding that 
subject, in view of having been 
caught red-handed in the middle 
of the crime in Isi’s laboratory a 
week ago. 

“And Dr. Wolfe’s analyses, 
they are progressing well? He 
has been able to classify our 
strange little, ah, mineral deposit 
from the quarry of Egypt?” 

I t was obvious that Pokrovskoe 
was pretending to know noth- 
ing of the composition of the 
stone, so I uttered something non- 
committal and turned the subject 
to another topic, a comparison of 
July weather here and in Mos- 
cow, I believe. But while convers- 
ing with Pokrovskoe in this trivial 
vein, I kept my ears open to the 
more animated conversation at 
my side between Kurlov and 
Chester. 

Kurlov was asking Chester 
what he thought the origin of 
the stone might be. But he wasn’t 
pumping Chester, as Pokrovskoe 
had tried to do with me. In fact, 
he was revealing to Chester a 
considerable knowledge of the 
stone’s composition. The labora- 

GALAXY 



tones at Dubna must have been 
woridng on tweity-four-Kour 
shifts during the last week to 
have provided him with as much 
information as he Had. He was 
aware of the stone’s anti-corro- 
sive properties, and of its ability 
to witiistand extremes of tempera- 
ture. 

He spoke eagerly, openly 
and frankly and attempted to 
conceal nothing. Clearly the sci- 
entist had come to the ascendancy 
in Kurlov’s personality, and the 
conspirator had receded to the 
backgroimd. Moreover, his previ- 
ous acquaintance with the affable 
and boyish Chester was obviously 
a factor in unlocking his tongue. 
Pokrovskoe, who spoke English 
well enough but obviously thought 
in Russian, was not able to fol- 
low the adjacent conversation as 
I was. 

Besides,, I was talldng all 
the louder, faster, and slangier to 
keep him preoccupied. 

“Yes, yes, yes, the slant line 
markings,” I overheard Kurlov 
say excitedly. “What do you 
make of them. Professor Wu? 
They intrigue me, you know. For 
some reason, I cannot now tell 
you why, I cannot regard them as 
trivial in the way Professor Wolfe 
has suggested. There is a certain 
regularity about them — although 
I have only seoi them the one 
time in the Professor’s laboratory 
that evening that we so rudely 
GODEL NUMBERS 



imposed on the kindness of Miss 
Hale — a certain regularity that 
suggests they represent something 
more than just a talley of oxen. 
Now tell me, my friend, what do 
you think?” 

Chester replied that He had 
been studying a photograph of 
the stone in his office that very 
morning in an effort to deduce 
something from the nature of the 
markings, but that nothing had 
suggested itself. “And the mes- 
sage, whatever it is that is en- 
coded by the slanted lines,” he 
concluded, “can’t be too conse- 
quential. There is just not enough 
there to say anything significant. 
At least, that is the most obvious 
conclusion to draw. Unless ...” 
Here He trailed off, looking vacu- 
ously at the bottom of his now 
empty glass. Again I Had the tin- 
canny feeling — call it a premoni- 
tion if you will — that Chester 
was on the verge of an important 
insight into the nature of the 
Cairo stone. 

But abruptly He and Kurlov 
broke away from us at this point 
to wander over to the bar to re- 
fill their glasses. As they were 
leaving, I heard Kurlov ask 
Chester if He might look at the 
photograph of the markings that 
Chester kept in his office. I took 
the opportunity offered by a lull 
in my conversation with Pokrov- 
skoe to excuse myself and went 
off in search of Isi. 

171 



V 



T found him at one of the small- 
er canape tables, spearing 
tempting pink shrimp from an 
iced bowl with a tooth-pick. I 
told him of my conversation with 
Pokrovskoe and sketched out 
the one I had heard between 
Chester and Kurlov. When I re- 
peated what Chester had said 
about having looked at a photo- 
graph of the markings earlier in 
the day, a look of concern passed 
over Isi’s face. 

“Matty, did Chester tell Kur- 
lov where he kept the photo- 
graph?” 

“He just said that he had been 
looking at it in his office,” I re- 
plied. “And Kurlov asked to see 
it some time.” 

“Goddamn it, that’s not good. 
Do you know, Matty, that no 
photographs were taken of the 
stone before I got it into my 
laboratory, and that I didn’t al- 
low any to be taken after that 
time?” By some extraordinary 
oversight, the Soviets had not 
obtained photographs of the stone 
before it got out of their hands. 
Not so extraordinary, I guess, 
if you reflect that the expedition 
at the quarry site had no need for 
camera equipment, and that the 
stone was flown by military jet 
directly from Egypt to the United 
States. 

“And if Kurlov wants to see 
172 



that photograph, that means ei- 
ther they overlooked taking shots 
of it when they got into your 
laboratory, or else we interrupted 
them Just as they were about to 
do so,” I said. “Probably the lat- 
ter. They could have got rid of 
Rebecca Hale again under some 
pretext or other, in order to take 
pictures.” 

“Yes,” Isi replied, now quite 
excited. “And Kurlov has by this 
time told Pokrovskoe about the 
photo in Chester’s office. There 
they are together at the big can- 
ap6 table, and Pokrovskoe looks 
as if he were going to take off in- 
to orbit. Let’s get out of here, 
Matty.” 

We bulled our way through the 
swarm of people standing around 
talking and drinking and made 
our way to the door of the room. 
On the way I caught sight of 
Chester, made a brief broken field 
detour, in which I caused quite a 
number of glasses to slosh over, 
and plucked him away by the 
arm from a flirtatious conversa- 
tion he was enjoying with some- 
body’s young wife, to rejoin Isi 
just as he was opening the door 
leading out of the reception hall. 
The foyer outside was unencum- 
bered of people, and we burst out 
from it into the starlit summer 
night with a common feeling of 
impending climax. 

Sharing a sense of urgency that 
we knew intuitively there was no 

GALAXY 



need to communicate to one an- 
other, we broke into a trot across 
the campus. The Computer Sci- 
ence Center, located on sloping 
ground slightly higher than that 
of the Faculty Club, was clearly 
visible to us, lights still glittering 
from a half dozen office windows, 
as we raced past the pond, the ad- 
ministration building, and the 
student union. It must have taken 
us only about three minutes from 
the time we left the Faculty Club 
to reach Chester’s office. We burst 
into it, Chester leading the way. 
He literally flung himself at the 
file cabinet next to the window, 
jerked open the second drawer 
from the top, rummaged furiously 
for a moment, spun around trium- 
phantly with the photograph of 
the Cairo stone in his hand. 

CtT)aby, you are going to go 
home tonight with Papa 
Wu’s number three son,” he 
chuckled. And with that we set- 
tled down in chairs to catch our 
breath and collect our wits after 
our little sprint across the cam- 
pus. We were winded in direct 
proportion to our ages: Isi was 
virtually knocked out, I was huff- 
ing and puffing moderately — 
but not too moderately — and 
Chester seemed scarcely affected 
by the exertion. Isi produced 
three of the strong, black Brazil- 
ian cigars — ^Rigolettos, they are 
called — that he was fond of, and 
GODEL NUMBERS 



we lit up in contentment and self- 
satisfaction. We had learned 
something at the reception, some- 
thing that might turn out to be 
quite significant. The Soviets had 
a piece of the Cairo stone all 
right, and we knew from Chester’s 
conversation with Kurlov that 
they were progressing along the 
same lines that Isi had followed 
in his laboratory analysis of the 
composition of the stone. But 
through negligence on their part, 
and some extraordinary good 
luck on ours, they had failed to 
photograph, and presumably to 
record in any way, the curious 
markings on the stone. What was 
more important, Kurlov was now 
interested — more than interest- 
ed, I should say — in th^se slant- 
ed lines. It was beginning to dawn 
on us that Kurlov’s interest in 
the inscriptions, as opposed to the 
substance of the stone itself,, 
might have tremendous signifi- 
cance. 

“But why should Kurlov be 
interested in a few unexplained 
scratches on that damned crazy 
rock?” Isi inquired plaintively. 

“Right,” I joined in. “After all, 
he’s a computer scientist, not an 
archeologist. His bag — ”I some- 
times like to pretend that student 
slang comes naturally to me. “ — 
is information theory, automation 
theory, machine theory, the same 
sort of thing Chester here does. 
Same kind of interests, right?” 

173 



“Yeh, that’s for sure,” Chester 
replied. “He has no interest in 
archeology or anthropology, I 
know from my year at Dubna. 
He’s a pure theoretician, through 
and through. About the most 
practical thing he can do is play 
chess.” 

“Well, let’s be logical about 
this,” I said. “If he is primarily 
interested, not in the chemical 
analysis of the stone, but in those 
cryptic little lines, then Ke is in- 
terested in them from the point 
of view of the computer scientist 
and information theorist, right?” 

“Agreed,” Isi joined in. “But 
that in turn implies that he does 
not regard them as oxen-count- 
ing notches — that he in some 
way thinks they encode infor- 
mation, a message if you will, of 
much greater significance. Yet 
frankly, that seems impossible 
to me. If the lines varied in shape 
or size, they might be construed 
as an alphabet. But as it is, they 
represent nothing more than 
numbers of notches. Surely it’s 
more logical to think of them as 
tallys for . , 

4 4XJumbers,” Chester said 
dreamily. He was looking 
towards the ceiling in complete 
abstraction, immersed in his own 
thoughts, the half-smoked cigar 
that Isi had given him clenched 
between his teeth. TKe expres^on 
in his eyes was tiSat same per- 
174 



plexed but on-the-verge-of-under-. 
standing look that I had seen! 
twice before when Chester had 
been thinking about the strange 
inscriptions on the stone. 

“Yes, numbers,” Isi replied a 
little irritably. “And just plain 
old fashioned numbers can’t tell 
you anything.” 

“Numbers can’t tell you any- 
thing?” Chester echoed absently 
again. 

“Oh, for God’s sake, Chester, 
please come back to earth.” Isi 
sighed wearily but nonetheless 
affectionately to the now incre- 
dibly youthful looking Chester. 

And Chester did come back to 
life. From one moment to the 
next, he was completely trans- 
formed. Now, his eyes flashing, 
he looked squarely at us. 

“That’s it,” he said excitedly. 
“That’s why they brought Kur- 
lov the computer and information 
expert over from Dubna. He sus- 
pected what I know now must be 
the case. Where’s the flipping 
ash tray?” 

Chester was so excited now that 
he was scarcely able to contain 
his energy. I pushed an ash tray 
under his nose, and he managed 
to miss it by six inches as he 
knocked the big flake off of his 
cigar. But he was much too elat- 
ed now to be concerned with ashes 
on his desk. 

“Chester, what are you trying 
to say?” I asked as calmly as 

GALAXY 



possible, although I too felt a 
thrill of excitement now, a sense 
of imminent and unexpected rev- 
elation. 

“Just,” this,” Chester expostu- 
lated. “Those slant lines on the 
Cairo stone represent numbers, 
all right, but they aren’t just or- 
dinary numbers. They are Godel 
numbers.” 

Concerned as I am in mathe- 
matical logic with recursive func- 
tions, I got the point immediately. 
And I guess Isi did too, or at 
least he grasped the general and 
enormous significance of what 
Chester had just said, for he 
asked for no further explanation. 
Mouths agape, I suppose, we just 
sat there in silence. 

And while we were sitting there, 
saying nothing, the little plastic 
cylinder rolled underneath the 
door. I suppose if a disinterested 
observer had been there to see 
us, he could have likened our re- 
actions to something like those in 
a Three Stooges comedy short. 

^ For we all three did something of 
a classic double take, looking first 
dumbly for about five seconds at 
the fountain-pen-length cylinder, 
then looking away from it at one 
another, then doing the double 
take. I had just started out of my 
chair when it burst, with a dull 
plop, to release its potent gas in- 
to the room. 

The effect was instantaneous. 
The three of us slumped towards 
GODEL NUMBERS 



the floor, all muscular control 
knocked out completely. Yet un- 
consciousness did not follow im- 
mediately. For about ten seconds 
I lay on the floor of Chester’s of- 
fice, knowing that I was blacking 
out, yet nonetheless capable of 
registering all that was happening 
during that time. And ten seconds 
was long enough to learn who had 
rolled the cylinder under the 
door and what they wanted; af- 
ter about three of those seconds, 
the door of Chester’s office open- 
ed, and three men, with handker- 
chiefs pressed to their noses, 
walked very composedly into the 
office, glanced about briefly un- 
til one of them saw the photo- 
graph on Chester’s desk, picked 
it up and then left just as quietly, 
just as matter of factly as they 
had entered, softly closing the 
door behind them. As one of them 
stooped to pick up the plastic 
cylinder that had contained the 
gas, I noticed a small scar over 
his left eye. Then ever5rthing dis- 
solved in front of me, and I lost 
consciousness. 

VI 

O ther than leaving us with a 
gigantic hangover, the knock- 
out gas had no toxic effects, and 
we were all back to normal by the 
afternoon of the following day. 
For the second time» we decided 
that accusation of the Russians 

175 



I 




to tfie autfiorities would gain 
nothing. Now tKey had every- 
thing that we Had, and there was 
no getting it back, short of a re- 
turn raid on tfidr establishment. 
OH, we discussed that, to be sure; 
but we gave it up as hopelessly 
unrealistic. We were amateurs in 
this espionage business, and they 
were pros. It wouldn’t help mat- 
ters tnucfi getting ourselves killed 
in some Heroic but futile attempt 
to get back the photograph. And 
what if we did? Surely they would 
have made any number of xerox 
or pHotostatic copies of it by this 
time, some of them probably on 
their way to the sanctuary of 
their embassy in Washington. Be- 
sides, we had more important 
176 



things to do. The first of these 
was to confirm or unconfimt 
Chester’s conjecture that the in- 
scriptions on the Cairo stone rep- 
resented a Godel number. 

I suppose most people have at 
least Heard about Kurt Godel’s 
astounding theorem, first publish- 
ed in 1931, concerning the incom- 
pleteness of arithmetic. The the- 
orem tells us, to put it briefly, 
that any axiomatization of ele- « 
mentary arithmetic must be in- 
complete in the sense that there 
will always be certain sentences 
of arithmetic — the famous Godel 
sentences — which are true, but 
not provable from the axioms. If 
that doesn’t make sense to you, 
think of it this way. It is as if 

GALAXY 




GOOa NUMBERS 



in ordinasK plane geometry you* 
could show that it was true that 
the angles of a triangle, say, al- 
ways added up to 180 degrees, but 
you could also prove that you 
could not prove that fact. Any- 
way, the .trick that Godel used to 
prove fiis theorem consisted in 
reflecting sentences about arith- 
metic — sentences in a so-called 
metalanguage talking about the 
object language, arithmetic — 
into arithmetic itself. Thus Godel 
diowed that there is a sentence 
of arithmetic to corresijond to 
every sentence about arithmetic 
such tiiat if the one is true, the 
other is too. Now take the follow- 
ing metalanguage sentence about 
arithmetic: “The arithmetic sen- 
tence corresponding to this sen- 
tence is unprovable.” Such a sen- 
tence asserts the unprovability of 
an ordinary formula of elemen- 
tary arithmetic, which happens to 
be true if and only if it is not 
provable. 

■^Tow the' trick Godel Used to 
^ mirror metalanguage state- 
ments into arithmetic itself hing- 
ed on the mechanism that has 
subsequently come to be called 
Godel numbering, if works this 
way. Suppose you assigned the. 
numbers 1 through 29, say, to 
the 26 letters of the English al- 
phabet, th6 comma, the period, 
and the blank space. The letter A 
corresponds to 1, B to 2, etc., on - 

177 



down to 2S for Z, 27 for the com- 
ma, 28 for the period and 29 for 
the blank space separating words 
in a printed text. Now take any 
message in English that you want 
to “Godelize” — i.e., to wHicli you 
want to assign a Godel number. 
What you do is write the message 

— supposed it is k units in length 

— as exponents, according to the 
pairing of letters and punctuation 
signs with numbers just given, on 
the product of the first k primes, 
written as follows: 2 .3.5.7. 
. Pk, where Pk stands for the 
kth prime. Take an example, Hie 
word “cab.” Since C is the third 
letter of the alphabet, A the first 
and B the second, they corre- 
spond respectively to 3, ’1’ and 2 
in tiSe pairing of numerals with 
letters of the alphabet. Now write 
these riiree numerals as exponents 
on the product of the three primes, 
and you get 23 3^5^, which is 
equal to 600. Thus the word 
“cab” has assigned to if the Godel 
number 600. And there is an 
absolutely unique decomposition 
of 600 back into a product of 
primes — this is a fundamental 
fact of mathematics. The upshot 
of all of this is that you can test 
any number in the whole infin- 
ite domain of numbers, and if it 
is a Godel number, it will “de- 
compose” — i.e., be factorable — 
into a product of successive 
primes with; exponent which can 
carry coded information. 

178 



This was Chester’s insight con- 
cerning the Cairo stone. He saw 
that if the slant lines could be 
construed as representing some 
gigantic number, and that num- 
ber was a Godel number, then 
with a suitable program we could 
get the Computer Center’s C.D. 
3600 to factor out the primes, 
in which case the exponents on 
the primes would be the coded 
message. And if the Godel num- 
ber was sufficient to contain an 
enormously complex and detailed 
message. Of course, we couldn’t 
expect the exponent numbers to 
correspond to the English alpha- 
bet, or to any alphabet, for that 
matter, in any such simple way 
as in my example; but once we had 
them, we could safely assume that 
they were the product of an in- 
telligence at least equal to ours, 
and that ffiey could be decoded in 
some fashion into a coherent mes- 
sage. 

D eciphering the slanted lines 
into a Godel number proved 
to be easier than I had anticipat- 
ed. As I mentioned earlier, there 
were nine rows of lines, none of 
the rows containing the same 
number of lines, and three of 
them indented about Half an inch. 
We assumed — it turned out cor- 
rectly — i that the stone was in its 
proper position with the evenly 
aligned (save for the indentions) 
side on the left. In this position, 

GALAXY 






,.we libticed. ^at the ’bottom row 
lines, the shortest one, contain- 
ed twelve numbers. This was sig- 
nificant. It strongly suggested a 
number system with the base 
twelve. It would not be unlikely 
for beings of superior intelligence 
to choose such a base for their 
ftumber system, as in many ways 
it is handier than the decimal 
system. And recall that the Baby- 
lonians used a number system 
with base twelve. Reading from 
top to bottom, the next three rows 
contained 41, 37 and 43 lines. 
The fifth row from the bottom, 
which contained 39 lines, was 
indented. The next two rows, 
still reading from the bottom to 
the top, contained 27 and 45 lines 
respectively, while the eighth 
row, which contained 17 lines, 
was al^ indented. The ninth, or 
top row, contained 19 lines. Af- 
ter several false starts, with the 
computer rejecting our tape in-f 
put as not a Godel number, we 
— actually mostly Chester and 
msrself, Isi not being strong on 
this sort of thing — decided the 
munber on the Cairo stone could 
be construed as just the sum of 
ithree huge numbers as follows: 
43 45 

37 27 

41 + 39 -f 19 

12 17 

It was this fantastically huge num- 
ber that Chester -fed into the C.D. 
' 3609 . I doubt if I ^all ever for^ 
IM 



- 7 . 7 ' 7 : 7 '^ 7 ^-' 

.get the 'thrill of .eXcittoerit,.Vthe 
shiver of impending revelation 
that I felt as the machine started 
typing out the result. For that 
huge number d/c? factor out into 
a product of the primes to various 
powers. It was a Godel number, 
and the exponents were our mes- 
sage. 

T shall not laboriously detail the 
final decoding of the expon- 
ents into the message they con- 
tained. You know, as well as I, 
that for years various projects 
Have appeared in print for lan- 
guage designed to. communicate 
with other forms of intelligent life 
in our imiverse. Ever since the de- 
velopment of radio-astronomy in 
the late fortie, the prospect of 
communication with other beings, 
perhaps of intelligence vastly su- 
perior to our own. Has been a 
very real possibility. So, in the 
final decoding of the message 
contained on the Cairo stone, we 
had by no means to start from 
scratch; much obtHe fundamental 
research had been done already. 
Need I mention Dr. Hans Freud., 
anthal’s monumental Lincos: De- 
sign oi a Language ior Cosmic 
Intercourse? The main break- 
through consisted in discovering 
that the lines represented a num- 
ber and that that number was a’ 
Godel number, capable ,of con- 
taining enormous amo^ts of in- 
form^on. This much alone .-as- 

GALAXY - 



sured us that the authors of the 
message on the Cairo stone were 
beings of an intelligence at least 
equal to our own. And once this 
assumption was made, we could 
assume that they would commu- 
ni to us in that universal language 
that all intelligent beings must 
possess, the language of mathe- 
matics. 

This turned out to be the case. 
The first series of exponents that 
the computer fed out were all 
two-digit numbers, eventually 
broken by a single digit serving, 
we discovered, as a period. WHat 
would be more logical than to as- 
sume that these numbers repre- 
sented Cartesion coordinates — 
the first for the x-axis, the second 
for the y-axis? Logical, but not 
quite right, it turned out. The re- 
sulting graph made no sense. But 
eventually it occurred to us that 
the convention of writing the x- 
coordinate first and the y-coordi- 
nate second was just that, a pure 
and arbitrary convention. So we 
tried another graph, this time re- 
versing the order of the coordi- 
nates. And this time we got some- 
thing — a squiggly line with a 
single point underneath it. Again, 
I am condensing literally hun- 
dreds of hours of work into the 
briefest of comments. But at any 
rate, some time late in an August 
night, after endless cups of black 
coffee and even blacker cigars — 
Isi swore that his Rigolettos con- 
GODEL NUMBERS 



tained nourishment, for the spirit 
if not the flesh — the squiggly 
line and point fell into place in 
our minds. The line was the Med- 
iterranean coast of Egsnpt — a 
portion of it — and the point rep- 
resented, on this crude sort of 
map, the location of the quarry 
pit where the Cairo stone Had 
been deposited, relative to the 
coast line. The next series of ex- 
ponents were also two digit num- 
bers, finally terminated, as be- 
fore, by a single digit (the same 
one as before) serving as a stop, 
or period. This time the graph 
was a closed line, again with a 
single dot — now inside the closed 
figure. An island with a specific 
location marked on it! We ran- 
sacked the library of every atlas 
that it contained, poring Ilirough 
them for the better part of a 
week, imtil we found a remote 
and uninhabited little atoll in the 
Pacific of exactly the shape of 
our graph. 

VII 

W hat happened subsequently 
to the decoding of the Cai- 
ro stone was a fascinating lesson 
in the exercise of power. Isi Had 
a conference with Dean Ortcutt 
on the morning following our dis- 
covery in the atlas of the atoll 
corresponding to the graph jdeld- 
ed up by the Cairo stone. Dean 
Ortcutt was in the Provost’s of- 

181 



fice within minutes of Isi’s visit, 
and within seconds all three were 
in the office of the President of 
State University. From that point 
on the long distance wires to 
Washington crackled almost in- 
cessantly until the State Depart- 
ment, the Pentagon and finally 
the President of the United States 
were all aware of the possible 
staggering importance of the de- 
coding of the slant lines. Red 
tape was cut as red tape can only 
be cut from the top-most reaches 
of power. Although ordinarily the 
detailed arrangements for arche- 
ological expeditions take months, 
even years to complete, we found 
that virtually within hours of 
Isi’s conference with Ortcutt a 
massive expedition to the atoll 
was underway. Nominally Lt. 
General Foster L. McCall — chief 
of research and development for 
the Air Force — was in command 
of- the expedition; but the de 
iacto head of operations turned 
out actually to be our own Isi- 
dore Wolfe. Almost miraculously, 
Chester and I found papers on 
our desks authorizing sabbatical 
leave with full pay for the follow- 
ing academic year. Usually this 
sort of thing requires a painstak- 
ing and painful filling in and 
exchanging of forms lasting 
montlis. And while all of this 
was going on, Chester, Isi and I 
finished decoding the remainder 
of the message of the Cairo stone. 
182 



The rest of the translation of 
the slant lines amounted to what 
was basically a. dictionary. It 
worked like this. A series of num- 
ber pairs when plotted on graph 
paper would yield a rough out- 
line of an object. Think of those 
children’s puzzles where you con- 
nect points 'in a certain order to 
get an outline picture. Following 
would be another series of num- 
ber pairs which, when plotted, 
would yield a short series of to- 
tally unfamiliar marks. The two 
together constituted a transla- 
tion of the name of the object 
into the language of the beings 
of tha Cairo stone. The first pic- 
ture was that of a camel, the 
second that of a jackal. Subse- 
quent pictures as plotted from the 
numbers the computer cranked 
out showed the camel running — 
followed by a series of marks 
including those originally corre- 
lated with those of the camel in 
a stationary position. So now we 
had a form of the verb “to run’’ 
And the same thing with the jack- 
al sitting. And so on and on. 
Within a week we had a fat note- 
book constituting a reasonably 
good dictionary of the language 
of the authors of the Cairo stone. 

A week was none too soon to 
finish decoding the stone, for 
within that time the expedition 
was completely organized. No ex- 
pense, no effort is spared when 
the vital interests of a world 

GALAXY 



power are at stake. Marine and 
Air Force noncoms appeared from 
nowKere to whisk our baggage in- 
to government cars. Waiting in 
the cars were high-ranking Air 
Force and Marine Corps officers. 
At the military air field where we 
were delivered, other officers took 
us in charge, fed us and wined us 
with amazing efficiency and 
speed, and got us aboard the giant 
Lockheed C-5A that was airlift- 
ing our expedition to the Pacific. 
All this without an error, and 
without even the appearance of 
haste. Isi and I found all of this 
exhilarating, although' Chester, 
who was troubled with a persis- 
tent cough, appeared to be tired 
of it. 

'^he flight to the atoll of the 
stone was without incident. 
We set down once to refuel at 
Pearl Harbor, then took off into 
the clear cloudless skies of the 
Western Pacific for the final leg 
of our journey. Isi, Chester and 
I were still working on the dic- 
tionary, clearing up minor ques- 
tions of tense, gender, etc., so the 
time went by swiftly enough for 
us. Within a matter of hours 
we could feel the great transport 
losing altitude. Looking out the 
window over the giant wing, we 
could see the atoll below us, bare 
save for coconut palms and an 
airstrip with an adjoining little 
cluster of tents that a battallion 
GODEL NUMBERS 



of Sea Bees had started prepar- 
ing for us the day that the expedi- 
tion had been definitely decided 
on in Washington. Once we had 
touched down, we were taken 
with our baggage by jeep to our 
tents, where we settled ourselves, 
rested and discussed our plans 
for the exploration of the atoll. 
The next morning, after a hot 
breakfast with the ever resource- 
ful Sea Bees, we met with Gener- 
al McCall and his staff in one of 
the tents that had been prepared 
as a sort of staff room, in which 
there were several tables covered 
with endless maps and detailed 
aerial pictures of the atoll, all 
prepared within the last week. 
The aerial surveys, it turned out, 
had disclosed a square-shaped de- 
pression, about a hundred yards 
on the side, almost exactly in the 
center of the atoll. Depressions 
can be explained by natural 
causes, but not square-shaped 
ones. We knew where to dig. 

The bulldozers were already on 
site when we arrived by jeep, 
but Isi thought it would be a 
wiser strategy to start the excava- 
tion with pick and shovel to avoid 
the danger of destroying an 3 rthing 
that might be fragile. This pro- 
cedure was followed, but nothing 
turned up that way the first day. 
The second day he sent the bull- 
dozers in. For two days the mon- 
ster blades bit and gouged at the 
soft sandy earth, and at noon of 

183 



the second day we found what we 
were looking for. It was the tip 
of a gigantic cone made of the 
same black obsidian-like material 
that we had first encountered in 
the Cairo stone. 

We were literally frantic with 
excitement, of course. But it took 
another hard week of excavating 
by the whole battallion of Sea 
Bees before the entire cone had 
been laid bare, and wooden bul- 
warks had been erected to keep 
the sides of what was now a gi- 
gantic pit from caving in. But it 
was well worth the wait. For the 
cone, which was squat and the 
size of a large house, turned out to 
be hollow inside. And at its base 
was a small oval shaped hole, 
just large enough to allow a man 
to crawl through. Once we had 
scraped out the earth that had 
fallen into the hole. General Mc- 
Call, Isi, and I entered the cone. 
Chester was not with us. He had 
been ill that morning, his cough 
having become more severe, and 
had stayed on his cot in our tent. 

I said that what we found was 
well worth the agonizing delay. 
It was. For arranged on strangely 
convoluted tables, or benches, of 
the black substance, and in vast 
racks built into the circular walls 
of the cone, were thousands upon 
thousands of black tablets, iden- 
tical in appearance to the Cairo 
stone. All of them were filled with 
the same kind of slant lines that 
184 



we had first seen that night — 
it seemed ages ago — in Isi’s lab- 
oratory. We had found the libra- 
ry of the beings of the Cairo 
stone. 

VIII 

W ork in removing the tab- 
lets from the cone to our 
Lockheed transport progressed 
rapidly, but under the cloud now 
of an impending tragedy. For 
Chester was seriously ill. He was 
coughing spasmodically now, and 
was alternately hot and terribly 
chilled. As far as Isi and I were 
concerned, the great joy of having 
found the accumulated wisdom of 
a superior race of beings was 
overshadowed by what appeared 
to be the approaching death of 
our closest friend. As soon as our 
transport plane had got us back 
to the states, we chartered a small 
private plane and took Chester 
directly to Boston and the Mas- 
sachusetts General Hospital. Af- 
ter a brief exploratory operation 
and a biopsy, the specialists thejre 
confirmed what the expedition’s 
physician had suspected. Chester 
was suffering from lymphosarco- 
ma, a vicious type of cancer that 
attacks the body’s lymph system. 
The disease was far advanced, and 
the prognosis was not good. Isi 
and I left Chester, now under 
heavy sedation and barely able 
to recognize us, at the hospital 

GALAXY 



and returned with leaden hearts 
to State University. 

It was more by way of therapy 
than for anjrthing else that we re- 
turned, despondent, to work of 
classifying and decoding the vast 
array of black tablets that had 
been deposited in a specially 
cleared wing of the library for 
us. But our despondency was 
lifted unexpectedly and immedi- 
ately by a stroke of almost mirac- 
ulous luck. For one of the first 
stones we started decoding turn- 
ed out to be a sort of index for 
all the rest. We found that the 
Godel numbers on the various 
tablets were arranged according 
to an elaborate and systematic 
scheme of classification — some 
pertaining to mathematics, oth- 
ers to physics, to chemistry, to 
molecular biology. And still oth- 
ers to medicine. To medicine! 
Here, in our hands, was the med- 
ical knowledge of a civilization 
far surpassing our own. Locked 
in one of those tablets was the 
knowledge that could save Ches- 
ter’s life, if we could only find it. 

A nd find it we did. We had to 
commandeer the Control 
Data 3600 full time to do it, but 
General McCall’s three stars and 
a host of officers and noncoms 
with pistols strapped threatening- 
ly to their sides helped to turn 
the trick. We found the tablet 
pertaining to leukemia and to 
GODEL NUMBERS 



lymphoma-type cancers, and we 
decoded it within 72 hours. The 
crucial piece of information that 
it contained concerned a remark- 
able enzyme called L-asparagin- 
ase, an enzyme that had been 
used already with some success 
against leukemia and Ijmiphoma 
victims by physicians in Dallas 
and Boston, but which was in 
desperately short supply. The 
difficulty was that only a minute 
supply of the enzyme had so far 
been produced by the laborious 
process of extraction from the ba- 
cillus Escherichia coli — ^not near- 
ly enough for the massive and re- 
peated doses needed to insure 
continued remission from the can- 
cer. The information that we ob- 
tained from the key tablet con- 
tained detailed instructions for 
synthesizing this enzyme directly 
from laboratory chemicals. It al- 
so contained vital information on 
dosage and on ways to counter 
the side effects of L-asparaginase. 

We got the drug to Boston in 
just the nick of time. Here Gen- 
eral McCall, who by now had be- 
come our staunch ally, was the 
key factor. He provided us with 
a supersonic B-5 to Boston, and 
a siren-screeching, three-star staff 
car to the hospital. The drug 
worked; Chester’s life was saved, 
and a momentous step in the con- 
quest of cancer had been made. 

The translation of the tablets 
is still going on. It will take years 

T85 



to translate all of the knowledge 
of a great and extinct civilization 
into our own language, and still 
more years to master it all. We 
still do not know tlie origin of tlie 
beings wlio left tlie Cairo stone in 
Egypt and thousands of tab- 
lets in the strange black cone- 
shaped library on a deserted atoll. 
For this information they did not 
include on any tablet. We specu- 
late wildly on their nature — 
alien beings from another galaxy, 
or the remnant of some great civi- 
lization that once flourished on 



earth and, in its death throes, left 
indestructible evidence of its ex- 
istence for future centuries to re- 
cover. But whatever their ori^n, 
they left us the knowledge to ex- 
plore the universe, certainly In 
space and perhaps in time. We 
will know the answers to these 
questions, and to others of Incal- 
culable importance as well. For 
the means to answer them were 
locked centuries ago into the Go- 
del numbers on the black tablets 
to which the Cairo stone led us.

by ALOIS BUDRYS 



Y ou know writing a book is 
very hard to do 60,000 words 
make a book, and writing 60,000 
words only means doing about 
two hours’ worth of typing every 
day for a month, but writing a 
book can take years. 

You don’t write a book. You 
write a story; the book is justtlie 
casebound, Smythe-sewn collec- 



187 



tion of what they call signatures 
in the book production trade, but 
a story is a structure of tGougfits. 
And they come out an individu- 
al’s mind. A mind . , well, you 
know what a mind is. It began 
that day you can remember if 
you stand on the very tiptoes of 
your recollection, back into when 
people fussed at you and kissed 
you and licked and patted you 
into a shape they could work 
with. All these years, now, you’ve 
been coping in your best way 
with what might be called their 
Handiwork, for want of a more 
descriptive term, and you’ve been 
readying yourself for whatever 
moment is supreme on your cal- 
endar, but suppose a passing an- 
gel said: “Explain Thyself” right 
now? 

That — a little bit — is like 
writing a book, if you write books 
instead of 60,000 words. Eh? You 
follow me? For some of the many 
people who write, the produc- 
tion of a story long enough to fill 
a book is a reply to an examin- 
ing angel, and I flatter myself I 
have some of them spotted. 

Take a man like Roger Ze- 
lazny. Sometimes he writes bet- 
ter than others. In fact, some- 
times — please don’t send me let- 
ters about this — he writes rath- 
er poorly. It’s hard to see that, 
because he writes with such tal- 
ent that what he has to say while 
ignoring the story he claims to 
188 



be telling is far better, and far 
more indicative of a good mind 
grasping beauty, that what you 
get from the people who not only 
write 60,000 words but the ration- 
ale to explain them, the declara- 
tions that affirm them, and the 
essays that enshrine them, all in 
one gust. Zelazny just sits there, 
smiling gently, dreaming his next 
satisfactory reply to the angel, 
and when the replies are more 
than satisfactory — which is bet- 
ter than Thee and Me Have been 
doing. I’ll bet you — they are 
Zingers. 

The Isle of The Dead, now. 
The Isle of The Dead (Ace) is a 
paperback, original about Francis 
Sandow, Occupation; God. 

An original paperback, mind 
you, is not like any other literary 
creature. Either by first inten- 
tion or because it Has fallen 
through the hardcover buying 
market, it tends to be shallow; 
lacking somewhere. An orginal 
paperback comes into being most 
often because it’s the quickest 
buck around — which also means 
the smallest buck, thence the 
shortest writing time. I hate to 
talk economic determinism, but 
there it is. An original paperback 
competes against reprint paper- 
backs, which have the advantage 
of pre-selling, of famous titles, 
of better-known by lines, review- 
ers’ quotes, accumulated word-to- 
mouth . you name the com- 

GALAXY 



mercial advantage, and the re- 
prints have it. 

Commonly, tlie only kinds of 
original paperbacks tliat make it 
at all are Kow-to-do-it books and 
similar ephemera such as west- 
erns, murders, and, even since 
RotH, pornography. 

These are not mere theories 
I’m handing you — or, let’s put it 
this way; these are statements so 
rigorously clung to, and followed, 
in the publishing business, that 
they might as well be objective 
facts. Editors, agents, publishers, 
and, in fact, the mass audience, 
can all be shown to believe them, 
and to put — or not put — their 
money where it counts, as proof 
of their belief. 

Which belief is normally justi- 
fed. Original paperbacks are 
written for the advance money 
— or, in John D. MacDonald’s 
case, the high royalty rate on the 
astronomical print order, plus the 
pleasure of it — and in order 
to get the advance money, you 
have to submit an outline that 
will knock an editor down. It 
has got to zap, snap, and promise 
’em everything. And then, of 
course, the book has to deliver, 
hoprfully before the advance is 
spent. Consequently, the original 
paperback — and I am very 
proud of each and every one of 
mine — typically shows signs of 
melodramatic plotting, and haste 
in the writing.

But some people are ready for 
the angel any time. 

So. The Isle ol the Dead, a 
paperback original by Roger Ze- 
lazny, either by first intention or 
because it fell through' the mar- 
ket (which I at least doubt), is 
not like your run of the mill ex- 
ample. 

I’ve brought us all this verbal 
way in an effort to do the im- 
possible — to transmit the effect 
of experience. Parents can’t do it 
with their children, teachers can’t 
do it with thdr students, but if 
we each of us sit down and re- 
member the tingle that comes 
over you when you do your job 
right, whatever the job is . 
that moment when you realize 
that this time it’s not just okay, 
or the cracks won’t show for a 
long time, or what the hell, it’ll 
do at the price, but that, instead, 
this time, without regard to the 
price, or the acuity of the pur- 
chaser, or the specifications, this 
time, not because we chose to, 
but because we couldn’t help it, 
it came out beautiful. Okay? So 
what if it’s a toilet seat or a can 
of beans? There it is — and what 
it is is secondary; what it has is 
everything touchable proof that 
beauty dwells within us and 
presses constantly against our 
limits. 

There. See. We did the impos- 
sible, for a moment. 

Okay. Now that’s what Ze- 

189 



lazny has done. Francis Sandow, 
Occupation: God, fancies himself 
a long-live ecological positivist; 
a professional world-designer who 
is approximately the eightieth- 
richest man in the universe, the 
last survivor of the centuries- 
gone 1960’s, commander of fi- 
nancial, technological and per- 
sonal resources so powerful and 
so deft that he is a god. Neither 
time nor space nor the power of 
his rivals can stay him; love and 
hate are very much' the same, and 
in the fullness of time come 
’round at the same hands and 
lips. His every move makes and 
breaks unaccountable millions. 
And since the rocks of his worlds 
were drawn together by his mind, 
and the living things upon them 
are sprung from the flesh’ of his 
own body, the very birds and 
bears of his worlds come to love 
him as he passes, and the rain 
and rivers are his on his moun- 
tains. 

All technology, of course. All 
explicable, or foreseeable, in the 
light of our own present accom- 
plishments. No miracles, no mys- 
teries. True, he did leam his trade 
at the hands of the Megapeians, 
and among the Megapeians a per- 
son who can create worlds, life 
and light is a god, with a god”s 
powers and attributes . , but 
this, of course, is only a conven- 
ient mental set which makes the 
manipulations easier. And the

rituals are soothing, even when 
clearly hallucinatory. 

And when an unknown enemy 
begins reviving his dead enemies 
and his dead loves . often the 
same, as we’ve said . it’s purely 
a matter of knocking the enemy’s 
head clean off. Right? Climactic 
battle at the edge of the world 
while the fate of the Universe 
waits to be awakened .... 

Well, I see you’re ahead of me. 
It ttims out Francis Sandow is 
a god, not just a good craftsman. 
Even when he creates a wart- 
bear, there’s a difference between 
his wart-bear and another man’s 
wart-bear. 

The Isle of The Dead, charted 
on some sort of blueprint paper, 
would disassemble into rather 
plain parts, I guess. I just thought 
I’d preume to tell you that, just 
as I’ve presumed to try to show 
why you might never tealize that 
mundane fact while reading this 
story. 

Zelazny just sits there a lot of 
the time, a slight smile on his 
face. He seems to be dreaming. 

1^ ate Wilhelm came upon the 
scene some years ago with 
stories like “The Mile-Lon^ 
Spaceship,” a piece of hard sci- 
ence fiction whose natural home 
was the ASF of those more inno- 
cent days. She’s a slim, tough, 
no-nonsense person, Kate is, with 
a strong streak of practical 

GALAXY 



dreamer in her, and uncommon 
courage. You meet her, and you 
think of Leigh Brackett, who 
wrote Bogart screenplays with 
Rasunond Chandler and William 
Faulkner the same time she was 
writing lead novelettes for Plan- 
et Stories. You read something 
like The Clone, which Kate wrote 
with Ted Thomas, and, knowing 
all these people, you think of 
Kate Wilhelm as somebody with 
a hell of a narrative gift, and an 
exact idea of what in people’s 
minds bring them to a piece of 
fiction in search of storytellng. 

The stories in her new Double- 
day collection. The Downstairs 
Room, ($4.95), include some 
very tough examples. Where they 
falter — and they do — their 
problem is over-working the in- 
ability to leave a line alone, the 
need to round off all the corners 
and define exactly what the artist 
meant, so that the stark shape 
of what could emerge is cloaked 
in a sort of plastic shrink-wrap, 
eliminating all the jags of the 
orginal, and frustrating the sense 
of touch. 

I think this may be Kate’s way 
of lowing the insecurity we all 
find, after all, at the root of the 
thing that makes us write. This is 
maybe why she agreed to precede 
each story with an explanatory 
note (Where are the prefaces to 
Steven Vincent Benet’s stories? 
Shirley Jackson — did she affix 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



a codicil to each testament? 
Where are the autobiographical 
intros to John Collier?). And 
one must simply decide that she 
never had a chance to read 
James Sallis’s introduction to her 
work. Or maybe she did, on sec- 
ond thought, but like, I suppose. 
Doubleday’s editors, shook her 
head and decided all that baffle- 
gab must mean something. After 
all, anybody can write a good 
story — as I said, this book is 
full of good stories, some better 
than others, but all of them sto- 
ries, and most of them good — 
but Sallis must be a genius, to be 
the author of “ ... the story has 
become a regenerating form of 
words, a total suspension of force, 
motive, and process . attaining 
a large measure of ambiguity and 
resonance, and . the elliptical, 
visionary qualities of the best 
non-realism.” 

Fortunately, though there ap- 
pear to be occasions when she 
Herself, God Help you, Jim, forgets 
it. The last time Kate Wilhelm 
displayed any elliptical qualities 
was long before she got into the 
author business. Despite the 
present general effort to make us 
all into academicians, she con- 
tinues to look more natural in 
overalls than she does in drag. 

Suddenly the Ace Specials line 
is coming up with winners (as 
distinct from its previous High 
percentage of interesting fail- 

191 



ures). Synthajoy, by D. G. 
Compton, makes me think of 
John Taine, Olaf Stapledon, and 
that bunch. 

Now, the sf line of the plot 
is a simple one, a scientist makes 
and markets tape-recorded emo- 
tional experiences as psychother- 
apeutic device. Originally, fie runs 
the electronic equivalent of an 
ethical drug fiouse, selling only 
by prescription. But in due course 
he also markets proprietary ver- 
sions of the stuff to tfie self-in- 
dulgent, and, since one of tfie 
popular versions is a superior 
sexual experience, and all of 
them are superior experiences of 
one kind or another, profound so- 
cial changes take place. Further- 
more, fie then produces an experi- 
mental tape containing not ex- 
periences but tfie supreme exalta- 
tions of all tfie possible experi- 
ences, snipped out of all tfie oth- 
er tapes, and spliced together in- 
to one fantastic emotional nova 
which fie is thinking of putting 
on tfie market under tfie name of 
Synthajoy, His wife kills him, 
or at least that’s wfiat a court 
says sfie did, thereupon throwing 
her in tfie booby hatch for . 
you guessed it . taped therapy. 

But I invoked some powerful 
names up tfiere in tfie preceding 
paragrapfi, and here you are, 
wondering in wfiat significant de- 
tail this story could be superior 
to something like MacDonald’s 
192 



Wine oi the Dreamers or any of 
the other sf stories about a world 
sinking below the surface of a 
wallow of direct brain-stimula- 
tion pleasure. 

Well, the thing is that this is 
a story about a woman who lias 
a problem. The woman is emo- 
tional, so it’s an emotional prob- 
lem. She’s socially conscious, so 
it is a problem whicfi implies 
grave consequences for the world,, 
in addition to herself. When she 
solves the problem, she in turn 
affects the world. 

But she doesn’t do it to save 
tfie world. She does it because 
her involvement with fier hus- 
band has brought her to this 
point. Her involvement with fier 
husband has made her frigid, 
and killed fier lover — and they 
were indeed lovers despite her 
physical incapability. Finally, 
because she goes to a public tape- 
experience vending station, and 
at last feels wfiat this thing is, 
sfie is in a hysterical state wfien 
sfie comes home and discovers 
fier husband’s mistress on tfie 
stairs, just leaving. And so she 
goes crazy. 

Her lover fiad died peacefully, 
under the spell of the prototype 
Ssmtfiajoy. Her frigidity resulted 
from having been present at tfie 
recording session for wfiat comes 
to be known as Sexitape — a 
play on tfie tradename of tfie eth- 
ical product, which is Sensitape.

You see, what hse happened to, 
this woman happens to lots of 
people, but it happens to Her in 
the filtered, recorded, amplifed 
and modulated form. 

What I’m sasdng is that most 
sf of modem, times uses people, 
however well-realized, to flesh 
out a story which, However rele- 
vant to the general Human con- 
dition, Has the purpose of verify- 
ing some technological proposi- 
tion. But really great sf, I think, 
comes most often wHen techno- 
logical assertions are used to ver- 
ify a human proposition. 

Synthajoy, I hasten to add, is 
not a Seeds of Life or Odd John, 
although the writing has that 
compelling, all-encompassing 
feeling that comes from telling 
a story in which every step peo- 
ple take is as important as their 
destinations. Compton ends on a 
note that would have occurred 
only ...to someone wHo’s read a 
great deal of sf, or something, 
and decided some such plot-tum 
is obligatory in commercial writ- 
ing. Which by the standards of 
commercial writing means this is, 
indeed, a cracking good book. 
More important, this is a crack- 
ing good book very nearly to the 
very end by the standards of 
cracking good books, and I hope 
there’s going to be considerably 
more Compton coming into the 
market. A lot of us could stand 
the example. -ALGIS BUDRYS

YOU’LL NEVER CLEAN, ADJUST OR REPLACE PLUGS AGAIN 

• get up to 5 more miles per gallon ol gas 

• add up to 30 more horsepower to your engine 

• saKe S100 each year tor you, year alter year 

• while you use the cheapest grades of gasoline! 





Spark plugs arc obsolete! Now there’s a far better way to run your car. 

With conventional spark plugs, only a fraction of the fuel that enters 
your cylinders is turned into power. The rest escapes through your tail- 
pipe as unburned vapor. That is because their spark is so narrow — only 
.l.S-thousandih.s of an inch wide - that it cannot possibly ignite all the 
fuel mixture in the cylinder. As plugs get older, their sparks get narrower 
and less efficient till they have to be replaced. 

New Jet-Fire Fuel Igniters do a far belter job of turning gasoline into 
power. Instead of a narrow spark, they send out a wide swath of flame 
that “walks” across a semi-conductor tip, fanning out in all directions 
and exploding far more fuel in the cylinder. 

Proof That You Get Up To 30 Horsepower More 
Jet-Fire Fuel Igniters look like spark plugs merely because they l^vc to 
be screwed into the spark plug socket. But what they do is far different. 
Here’s how to prove it; 

Run your car till It’s fully warmed op. 2. Slop on a perfectly level 



.stretch of road. 3. Pul tha^car in Drive list gear with manual transmis- 
sion!, and see how fast the car rolls at idling .speed. 4. Remove plugs and 
install Jet-Fire Fuel Igniters (a 10-minute job). 5. Now see how fast yo^ 



car rolls at idling speed. You can expect it to go 4 TO 6 MILES PER 
hour faster without touching the gas pedal — dramatic proof that 
Jet-Fire Fuel Igniters increase engine RPMs by 100 to 150 'jjjh no In- 
crease in gas consumption. (At high speeds, RPMs increase by 300 to 350.) 



So. first thing, you can reduce the gas flow bv adjusting the idling screw, 
and start saving money before you’ve even driven a mile! 

(At the same time, you can make’ your air-to-gas mixture 
Igniters require only a 15:1 ratio instead of the conventional ^-l^” 



simple adjustmeni that you or your mechanic can make in one minute 
It provides even greater economy.)

enough to explode all the fuel

Start driving and you’ll notice even more improvement - up to 10 ^

The next lime your gas gauge gets near the *iEmpty” mark, tell the 
attendant to fill it up with REGULAR! Chances arc you’ll no longer need

And this second saving is only the beginning. Jet-F-ire riiel igniters
