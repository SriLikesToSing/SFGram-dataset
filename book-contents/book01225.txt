MARS LANDSCAPE — Mars would probably be disappointing from a scenic 
standpoint. Its eroded hills and ice caps would be the only relief in the 
monotonous horizon of barren wasteland. Perpetual dust storms, insufficient 
atmosphere, and blinding sun would inflict physical discomforts. Here, ex- 
plorers study the terrain as their space ship makes aerial studies. The deep 
crevices that split the desert could be the "canals" that form geometric pat- 
terns in the astronomers telescope. On the horizon is one of the ice, or polar, 
caps.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

YOU KNOW, I’ve always had a bit 
of faith in that old adage that says 
“it is difference of opinion that 
makes horse races”. I think the 
coiner of that was a great Amer- 
ican named Samuel Clemens, who 
was bom in Florida, Missouri, over 
a hundred years ago. He wrote a 
lot of kinda wonderful stuff about 
the Mississippi and other things 
under the pseudonym of Mark 
Twain. Remember it? Well, I 
guess I didn’t take that “difference 
of opinion” quite literally enough. 
I shoulda known that when it says 
horse races it means horse races. 
Anyhow, IF ain’t a horse-racing 
sheet — so I’ve been wrong. About 
disagreeing, or difference of opin- 
ion, that is. Especially about the 
writers who write for IF. But I’ve 
seen the light . 

The light was in a letter I got 
recently from a gentleman up in 
Houlton, Maine, who seems to 



have read a science fiction maga- 
zine for the first time. He says he 
wouldn’t have bothered reading it 
but for his “very persuasive broth- 
er, who, like others, is very fanatic 
about this kind of literature”. Well, 
all that’s okay. There’s them what 
likes science fiction and them what 
don’t. It’s a free country and all 
that, you know. But here’s the part 
that showed me the light. Quote: 
“It seems to me as though your 
writers must be slightly crazy. They 
all disagree about the future in 
particular.” 

Now, can you imagine anybody 
putting out a magazine with writ- 
ers who disagree? It’s absurd. Writ- 
ers should all think and write alike. 
Anybody knows that if one writer 
says the human race is going to 
have green hair, lavender skin, 
three arms and five legs in the year 
2157, by golly they’re all gonna say 
it. The manuscript that says it’s 
going to happen in 2156 or 2158 
gets sent back. And I think I’d bet- 
ter get busy and write all our 
authors to the effect that anybody 
who fools around with ideas about 
future experiments in nuclear fis- 
sion or gravity or brassieres with- 
out coming to an agreement with 
the others appearing in that issue 
is due for a blackball. 

SO I GUESS I’m on the right trade 
at last. Now about our stories being 
“too fantastic to consider”. I’ll also 
have to correct that right away. 
Practically everybody knows that 
great writers of past centuries nev- 
er dreamed up such fantastic 
things as steam power, air travel, 
underwater craft, radio, gravity, 
biotics, atomic power, astronomy. 



etc., etc. Anybody who ever read a 
history book knows that the im- 
mortals of science — da Vinci, Fara- 
day, Edison, Galileo, Newton, to 
name a few — always got a unani- 
mous vote of confidence from their 
readers and critics. Nobody consid- 
ered their dreams fantastic. They 
never cooked up a broth that was 
centuries ahead of their times. For 
example, suppose somebody had 
put a television set down in front 
of George Washington, with Dag- 
mar doing her stuff. Would he 
have cried fantastic! Not about the 
television set, he wouldn’t. Televi- 
sion, which practically everybody 
has got a set of these days, wasn’t 
fantastic in those days. 

This thing of writers letting their 
imaginations run off is bad stuff. 
They ought to stick to solid facts, 
something you can put your feet 
in. Like a pair of old galoshes or 
something. Come to think of it, 
somebody had to dream those up — 
or did they? Remind me to ask a 
boot manufacturer sometime just 
how we got galoshes. However, an 
idea just barged into that thing I 
hang my hat on: Why not get out 
a reprint of the Podunk telephone 
directory? Then you can really 
check your facts. All you need is a 
pocketful of nickels and dimes. 

Whether the thought in the final 
paragraph applies to all science 
fiction magazines or not, I don’t 
know, but here’s how it goes: “A 
magazine like yours is hardly sensi- 
ble reading for anyone.” And he 
signs off with “truthfully”, so I 
guess he means it. Now that dum 
right hurts. But I’m gonna take it 
to heart and request an IQ from 
everybody around the office. 



So I took this letter seriously and 
I hope our readers do, too. And 
when this gentleman from Maine 
borrows the next issue of IF, he’ll 
be happy to see that all the writers 
therein have certificates stating 
that they have never been within 
100 miles of a laughing academy, 
and what’s more they’ll all agree in 
their plots and ideas concerning 
the future. They’re going to get 
their slide rules out and everyone 
is going to come up with the iden- 
tical answer. 

DOGGONE! I just happened to 
run into a friend of mine last night 
who was one of “hell’s angels” way 
back in 1917 and 1918. His name 
is Henry Jones and he was one of 
those daredevil knights of the skies 
who formed part of that elite fly- 
ing group known as the Lafayette 
Escadrille. Well, we got to chin- 
ning about flying in those days, 
when their “kites” were covered 
with a cloth fabric and painted 
with a substance known as “dope” 
and a 30-calibre bullet came in one 
side and went out the other and 
they came back plenty mornings 
looking like a piece of Swiss 
cheese. Anyhow, we talked avia- 
tion clean up through the jet jobs 
of today that can crowd a thou- 
sand miles per hour. When the 
chin music was over, we had it all 
figured out how, ten years hence, 
we’d be crossing the Atlantic in 
better than three hours, with 120- 
passenger ram jets doing 1250 
miles per at 35000 feet. You 

know, that’s too fantas 

Now, about that little ole light. 
I’d a sworn it was around here 
some place. — jlq

A captivating new story, by the author of The Explora- 
tion of Space, in which a stubborn archeologist and an 
equally stubborn magazine reporter get delightfully in- 
volved with five million years of culture and that old 
pdage about possession being nine-tenths of the law. 



By Arthur C. Clarke 



Illustrated by Ed Valigursky 




ROFESSOR FORSTER is such 
a small man that a special space- 
suit had to be made for him. But 
what he lacked in physical size he 
more than made up — as is often the 
case — in sheer drive and determi- 
nation. When I met him, he’d 
spent twenty years pursuing a 
dream. What is more to the point, 
he had persuaded a whole succes- 
sion of hard-headed business men, 



World Council Delegates and ad- 
ministrators of scientific trusts, to 
underwrite his expenses and to fit 
out a ship for him. Despite every- 
thing that happened later, I still 
think that was his most remarkable 
achievement . 

The Arnold Toynbee had a crew 
of six aboard when we left Earth. 
Besides the Professor and Charles 
Ashton, his chief assistant, there

ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



was the usual pilot-navigator-en- 
gineer triumvirate and two grad- 
uate students — Bill Hawkins and 
myself. Neither of us had ever gone 
into space before, and we were still 
so excited over the whole thing that 
we didn’t care in the least whether 
we got back to Earth before the 
next term started. We had a strong 
suspicion that our tutor had very 
similar views. The reference he had 
produced for us was a masterpiece 
of ambiguity, but as the number of 
people who could even begin to 
read Martian script could be 
counted on the fingers of one hand, 
we’d got the job. 

As we were going to Jupiter, and 
not to Mars, the purpose of this 
particular qualification seemed a 
little obscure, though knowing 
something about the Professor’s 
theories we had some pretty shrewd 
suspicions. They were partly con- 
firmed when we were ten days out 
from Earth. 

The Professor looked at us very 
thoughtfully when we answered his 
summons. Even under zero g he al- 
ways managed to preserve his dig- 
nity, while the best we could do 
was to cling to the nearest hand- 
hold and float around like drifting 
seaweed. I got the impression 
(though I may of course be 
wrong) that he was thinking 
“What have 1 done to deserve 
this?” as he looked from Bill to me 
and back again. Then he gave a 
sort of “It’s too late to do anything 
about it now” sigh and began to 
speak in that slow, patient way he 
always does when he has something 
to explain. At least, he always uses 
it when he’s speaking to us. 

“Since we left Earth,” he said, 



“I’ve not had much chance to tell 
you the purpose of this expedition. 
Perhaps you’ve guessed it already.” 

“I think I have,” said Bill. 

“Well, go on,” replied the Pro- 
fessor, a peculiar gleam in his eye. 
I did my best to stop Bill, but have 
you ever tried to kick anyone when 
you’re in free fall? 

“You want to find some proof — 
I mean, some more proof — of your 
diffusion theory of extra-terrestrial 
culture.” 

“And have you any idea why I’m 
going to Jupiter to look for it?” 

“Well — not exactly. I suppose 
you hope to find something on one 
of the moons.” 

“Brilliant, Bill — brilliant. There 
are fifteen known satellites, and 
their total area is about half that of 
Earth. Where would you start 
looking if you had a couple of 
weeks to spare? I’d rather like to 
know.” 

Bill glanced doubtfully at the 
Professor, as if he almost suspected 
him of sarcasm. 

“I don’t know much about 
astronomy,” he said. “But there 
are four big moons, aren’t there? 
I’d start on those.” 

“For your information, Io, Eu- 
ropa, Ganymede and Callisto are 
each about as big as Africa. Would 
you work through them in alpha- 
betical order?” 

“No,” Bill replied promptly. “I’d 
start on the one nearest Jupiter 
and go outwards.” 

“I don’t think we’ll waste any 
more time pursuing your logical 
processes,” sighed the Professor. He 
was obviously impatient to begin 
his set speech. “Anyway, you’re 
quite wrong. We’re not going to 




JUPITER FIVE

the big moons at all. They’ve been 
photographically surveyed from 
space and large areas have been ex- 
plored on the surface. They’ve got 
nothing of archeological interest. 
We’re going to a place that’s never 
been visited before.” 

“Not to Jupiter!” I gasped. 

“Heavens, no — nothing as dras- 
tic as that! But we’re going nearer 
to him than anyone else has ever 
been.” 

He paused thoughtfully. 

“It’s a curious thing, you know 
— or you probably don’t — that it’s 
nearly as difficult to travel between 
Jupiter’s satellites as it is to go be- 
tween the planets, although the 
distances are so much smaller. This 
is because Jupiter’s got such a ter- 
rific gravitational field and his 
moons are traveling so quickly. 
The innermost moon’s moving al- 
most as fast as Earth and the jour- 
ney to it from Ganymede costs al- 
most as much fuel as the trip from 
Earth to Venus, even though it 
takes only a day and a half. 

“And it’s that journey which 
we’re going to make. No one’s ever 
done it before because nobody 
could think of any good reason for 
the expense. Jupiter Five is only 
eighteen miles, in diameter, so it 
couldn’t possibly be of much inter- 
est. Even some of the outer satel- 
lites, which are far easier to reach, 
haven’t been visited because it 
hardly seemed worth while to 
waste the rocket fuel.” 

“Then why are we going to 
waste it?” I asked impatiently. The 
whole thing sounded like a com- 
plete wild-goose chase, though so 
long as it proved interesting, and 
involved no actual danger, I didn’t 



greatly mind. 

Perhaps I ought to confess — 
though I’m tempted to say nothing, 
as a good many others have done 
— that at this time I didn’t believe 
a word of Professor Forster’s the- 
ories. Of course, I realized that he 
was a very brilliant man in his 
field, but I did draw the line at 
some of his more fantastic ideas. 
After all, the evidence was so slight 
and the conclusions so revolution- 
ary that one could hardly help be- 
ing skeptical. 

Perhaps you can still remember 
the astonishment when the first 
Martian expedition found the re- 
mains not of one ancient civiliza- 
tion, but of two. Both had been 
highly advanced, but both had per- 
ished more than five million years 
ago. The reason was unknown 
(and still is) : it did not seem to be 
warfare, as the two cultures appear 
to have lived amicably together. 
One of the races had been insect- 
like, the other vaguely reptilian. 
The insects seem to have been the 
genuine, original Martians: the 

reptile-people — usually referred to 
as “Culture X” — had arrived on 
the scene later. 

So, at least, Professor Forster 
maintained. They had certainly 
possessed the secret of space travel, 
because the ruins of their peculiar 
cruciform cities had been found on 
— of all places — Mercury. Forster 
believed that they had tried to col- 
onize all the smaller planets — 
Earth and Venus having been 
ruled out because of the excessive 
gravity. It was a source of some 
disappointment to the Professor 
that no traces of Culture X had 
ever been found on the Moon, 




8 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



though he was certain that such a 
discovery was only a matter of 
time. 

The “conventional” theory of 
Culture X was that it had origi- 
nally come from one of the smaller 
planets or satellites, had made 
peaceful contact with the Martians 
— the only other intelligent race in 
the known history of the System — 
and had died out at the same time 
as Martian civilization. But Pro- 
fessor Forster had more ambitious 
ideas: he was convinced that Cul- 
ture X had entered the Solar Sys- 
tem from interstellar space. The 
fact that no one else believed this 
annoyed him, though not very 
much, for he is one of those people 
who is only happy when in a mi- 
nority. 



F ROM WHERE I was sitting, I 
could see Jupiter through the 
cabin porthole as Professor Forster 
unfolded his plan. It was a beauti- 
ful sight: I could just make out the 
equatorial cloud belts and three of 
the satellites were visible as little 
stars close to the planet. I won- 
dered which was Ganymede, our 
first port of call. 

“If Jack will condescend to pay 
attention,” the Professor continued, 
“HI tell you why we’re going such 
a long way from home. You know 
that last year I spent a good deal 
of time poking among the ruins in 
the twilight belt of Mercury. Per- 
haps you read the paper I gave on 
the subject at the London School 
of Economics. You may even have 
been there — I do remember a dis- 
turbance at the back of the hall. 
“What I didn’t tell anyone then 



was that while I was on Mercury I 
discovered an important clue to 
the origin of Culture X. I’ve kept 
quiet about it, although I’ve been 
sorely tempted when fools like Dr. 
Haughton have tried to be funny 
at my expense. But I wasn’t going 
to risk letting someone else get here 
before I could organize this expedi- 
tion. 

“One of the things I found on 
Mercury was a rather well-pre- 
served bas-relief of the Solar Sys- 
tem. It’s not the first that’s been 
discovered — as you know astro- 
nomical motifs are common in true 
Martian and Culture X art. But 
there were certain peculiar symbols 
against various planets, including 
Mars and Mercury. I think the 
pattern had some historic signifi- 
cance, and the most curious thing 
about it is that little Jupiter Five — 
one of the least important of all the 
satellites — seemed to have the most 
attention drawn to it. I’m con- 
vinced that there’s something on 
Five which is the key to the whole 
problem of Culture X, and I’m go- 
ing there to discover what it is.” 

As far as I can remember now, 
neither Bill nor I was particularly 
impressed by the Professor’s story. 
Maybe the people of Culture X 
had left some artifacts on Five for 
obscure reasons of their own. It 
would be interesting to unearth 
them, but hardly likely that they 
would be as important as the Pro- 
fessor thought. I guess he was rath- 
er disappointed at our lack of en- 
thusiasm: if so it was his fault 
since, as we discovered later, he 
was still holding out on us. 

We landed on Ganymede, the 
third and largest moon, about a 




JUPITER FIVE 



9 



week later. Ganymede is the only 
one of the satellites with a perma- 
nent base on it — there’s an observa- 
tory and a geophysical station with 
a staff of about fifty scientists. They 
were rather glad to see visitors, but 
we didn’t stay long, as the Profes- 
sor was anxious to refuel and set 
off again. The fact that we were 
heading for Five naturally aroused 
a good deal of interest but the pro- 
fessor wouldn’t talk and we 
couldn’t — he kept too close an eye 
on us. 

Ganymede, by the way, is quite 
an interesting place and we man- 
aged to see rather more of it on the 
return journey. But as I’ve prom- 
ised to write an article for another 
magazine about that, I’d better not 
say anything else here.* 



T HE HOP from Ganymede to 
Five took just over a day and a 
half, and it gave us an uncom- 
fortable feeling to see Jupiter ex- 
panding hour by hour until it 
seemed as if he was going to fill the 
sky. I don’t know much about as- 
tronomy, but I couldn’t help think- 
ing of the tremendous gravity field 
we were falling into. All sorts of 
things could go wrong so easily. If 
we ran out of fuel we’d never be 
able to get back to Ganymede, and 
we might even drop into Jupiter 
himself. 

I wish I could describe what it 
was like seeing that colossal globe, 
with its raging storm belts spinning 
in the sky ahead of us. Luckily 
there have been so many color 
close-ups of Jupiter published by 

*You might li\e to Keep your eyes on 
the “National Geographic” next spring . 



now that you’re bound to have 
seen some of them. You may even 
have seen the one which, as I’ll ex- 
plain later, was the cause of all our 
trouble. 

At last Jupiter stopped growing: 
we’d swung into the orbit of Five 
and would soon catch up with the 
tiny moon as it raced around the 
planet. We were all squeezed in the 
control room waiting for our first 
glimpse of our target — at least, all 
of us who could get in were doing 
so. Bill and I were crowded out 
into the corridor and could only 
crane over other people’s shoulders. 
Kingsley Searle, our pilot, was in 
the control seat looking as unruf- 
fled as ever: Eric Fulton, the en- 
gineer, was thoughtfully chewing 
his mustache and watching the fuel 
gauges, and Tony Groves was do- 
ing complicated things with his 
navigation tables. 

And the Professor appeared to 
be rigidly attached to the eyepiece 
of the teleperiscope. Suddenly he 
gave a start and we heard a whistle 
of indrawn breath. After a minute, 
without a word, he beckoned to 
Searle, who took his place at the 
eyepiece. Exactly the same thing 
happened, and then Searle handed 
over to Fulton. It got a bit monoto- 
nous by the time Groves had react- 
ed identically, so we wormed our 
way in and took over after a bit of 
opposition. 

I don’t know quite what I’d ex- 
pected to see, so that’s probably 
why I was disappointed. Hanging 
there in space was a tiny gibbous 
moon, its “night” sector lit up faint- 
ly by the reflected glory of Jupiter. 
And that seemed to be all. 

Then I began to make out addi- 




10 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



tional markings, in the way that 
you do if you look through a tele- 
scope for long enough. There were 
faint criss-crossing lines on the sur- 
face of the satellite, and suddenly 
my eye grasped their full pattern. 
For it was a pattern: those lines 
covered Five with the same geo- 
metrical accuracy as the lines of 
latitude and longitude divide up a 
globe of the Earth. I suppose I 
gave my whistle of amazement, for 
then Bill pushed me out of the way 
and had his turn to look. 

The next thing I remember is 
Professor Forster looking very 
smug while we bombarded him 
with questions. 

“Of course,” he explained, “this 
isn’t as much a surprise to me as it 
is to you. Besides the evidence I’d 
found on Mercury, there were 
other clues. I’ve a friend at the 
Ganymede Observatory whom I’ve 
sworn to secrecy and who’s been 
under quite a strain these last few 
weeks. It’s rather surprising to any- 
one who’s not an astronomer that 
the Observatory has never both- 
ered much about the satellites. The 
big instruments are all used on ex- 
tra-galactic nebulae, and the little 
ones spend all their time looking at 
Jupiter. 

“The only thing the Observatory 
had ever done to Five was to meas- 
ure its diameter and take a few 
photographs. They weren’t quite 
good enough to show the markings 
we’ve just observed, otherwise 
there would have been an investi- 
gation before. But my friend Law- 
ton detected them through the 
hundred centimeter reflector when 
I asked him to look, and he also 
noticed something else that should 



have been spotted before. Five is 
only eighteen miles in diameter, 
but it’s much brighter than it 
should be for its size. When you 
compare its reflecting power — its 
aldeb — its — ” 

“Its albedo!” 

“Thanks, Tony — its albedo with 
thaf of the other moons, you find 
that it’s a much better reflector 
than it should be. In fact, it be- 
haves more like polished metal 
than rock.” 

“So that explains it!” I said. 
“The people of Culture X must 
have covered Five with an outer 
shell — like the domes they built on 
Mercury, but on a bigger scale.” 

The Professor looked at me rath- 
er pityingly. 

“So you still haven’t guessed!” 
he said. 

I don’t think this was quite fair. 
Frankly, would you have done any 
better in the same circumstances? 



W E LANDED three hours later 
on an enormous metal plain. 
As I looked through the portholes, 
I felt completely dwarfed by my 
surroundings. An ant crawling on 
the top of an oil storage tank might 
have had much the same feelings — 
and the looming bulk of Jupiter up 
there in the sky didn’t help. Even 
the Professor’s usual cockiness now 
seemed to be overlaid by a kind of 
reverent awe. 

The plain wasn’t quite devoid of 
features. Running across it in var- 
ious directions were broad bands 
where the stupendous metal plates 
had been joined together. These 
bands, or the criss-cross pattern 
they formed, were what we had 




JUPITER FIVE 



11 



seen from space. 

About three hundred yards away 
was a low hill — at least, what 
would have been a hill on a nat- 
ural world. We had spotted it on 
our way in after making a careful 
survey of the little satellite from 
space. It was one of six such pro- 
jections, four arranged equidistant- 
ly around the equator and the 
other two at the Poles. The as- 
sumption was pretty obvious that 
they would be entrances to the 
world below the metal shell. 

I know that some people think it 
must be very entertaining to walk 
around on an airless, low-gravity 
planet in space-suits. Well, it isn’t. 
There are so many points to think 
about, so many checks to make and 
precautions to observe, that the 
mental strain outweighs the glam- 
our — at least as far as I’m con- 
cerned. But I must admit that this 
time, as we climbed out of the air- 
lock, I was so excited that for once 
these things didn’t worry me. 

The gravity of Five was so mi- 
croscopic that walking was com- 
pletely out of the question. We 
were all roped together like moun- 
taineers and blew ourselves across 
the metal plain with gentle bursts 
from our recoil pistols. The experi- 
enced astronauts, Fulton and 
Groves, were at the two ends of the 
chain so that any unwise eager- 
ness on the part of the people in 
the middle was restrained. 

It took us only a few minutes to 
reach our objective, which we dis- 
covered to be a broad, low dome at 
least six hundred yards in circum- 
ference. I wondered if it was a gi- 
gantic airlock, large enough to per- 
mit the entrance of whole space- 



ships. Unless we were very lucky, 
we might be unable to find a way 
in since the controlling mechanisms 
would no longer be functioning — 
and even if they were, we would 
not know how to operate them. It 
would be difficult to imagine any- 
thing more tantalizing than being 
locked out, unable to get at the 
greatest archeological find in all 
history. 

We had made a quarter circuit of 
the dome when we found an open- 
ing in the metal shell. It was quite 
small — only about seven feet across 
— and it was so nearly circular that 
for a moment we did not realize 
what it was. Then Tony’s voice 
came over the radio: 

“That’s not artificial. We’ve got 
a meteor to thank for it.” 

“Impossible!” protested Profes- 
sor Forster. “It’s much too regu- 
lar.” 

Tony was stubborn. 

“Big meteors always produce cir- 
cular holes, unless they strike very 
glancing blows. And look at the 
edges — you can see there’s been an 
explosion of some kind. Probably 
the meteor and the shell were va- 
porized — we won’t find any frag- 
ments.” 

“You’d expect this sort of thing 
to happen,” put in Kingsley. “How 
long has this been here? Five mil- 
lion years? I’m surprised we 
haven’t found any other craters.” 
“Maybe you’re right,” said the 
Professor, too pleased to argue. 
“Anyway, I’m going in first.” 
“Right,” said Kingsley, who as 
captain had the last say in all such 
matters. “I’ll give you seventy feet 
of rope and will sit in the hole so 
that we can keep radio contact.

Otherwise this shell will blanket 
your signals.” 

So Professor Forster was the first 
man to enter Five, as he deserved 
to be. We crowded close to Kings- 
ley so that he could relay news of 
the Professor’s progress. 

He didn’t get very far. There 
was another shell just inside the 
outer one, as we might have ex- 
pected. The Professor had room to 
stand upright between them, and 
as far as his torch could throw its 
beam he could see avenues of sup- 
porting struts and girders, but that 
was about all. 

It took us twenty-four exasper- 
ating hours before we got any 
further. Near the end of that time 
I remember asking the Professor 
why he hadn’t thought of bringing 
any explosives. He gave me a very 
hurt look. 

“There’s enough aboard the ship 
to blow us all to glory,” he said. 
“But I’m not going to risk doing 
any damage if I can find another 
way.” 

That’s what I call patience, but 
I could see his point of view. After 
all, what was another few days in a 
search that had already taken him 
twenty years? 



I T WAS Bill Hawkins, of all peo- 
ple, who found the way in when 
we had abandoned our first line of 
approach. Near the North Pole of 
the little world he discovered a 
really giant meteor hole — over a 
hundred yards across and cutting 
through both the outer shells sur- 
rounding Five. It had revealed still 
another shell below those, and by 
one of those chances that must hap- 



pen if one waits enough aeons, a 
second, smaller, meteor had come 
down inside the crater and pene- 
trated the innermost skin. The hole 
was just big enough to allow en- 
trance for a man in a space-suit. 
We went through head first, one at 
a time. 

I don’t suppose I’ll ever have a 
more weird experience than hang- 
ing from that tremendous vault, 
like a spider suspended beneath 
the dome of St. Peter’s. We only 
knew that the space in which we 
floated was vast: just how big it 
was we could not tell, for our 
torches gave us no sense of distance. 
In this airless, dustless cavern the 
beams were, of course, totally in- 
visible and when we shone them on 
the roof above, we could see the 
ovals of light dancing away into 
the distance until they were too 
diffused to be visible. If we pointed 
them “downwards” we could see a 
pale smudge of illumination so far 
below that it revealed nothing. 

Very slowly, under the minute 
gravity of this tiny world, we fell 
downwards until checked by our 
safety ropes. Overhead I could see 
the tiny glimmering patch through 
which we had entered: it was re- 
mote but reassuring. 

And then, while I was swinging 
with an infinitely sluggish pendu- 
lum motion at the end of my cable, 
with the lights of my companions 
glimmering like fitful stars in the 
darkness around me, the truth sud- 
denly crashed into my brain. For- 
getting that we were all on open 
circuit, I cried out involuntarily: 

“Professor — I don’t believe this 
is a planet at all! It’s a spaceship!” 

Then I stopped, feeling that I 




JUPITER FIVE 



13 



had made a fool of myself. There 
was a brief, tense silence, then a 
babble of noise as everyone else 
started arguing at once. Professor 
Forster’s voice cut across the con- 
fusion and I could tell that he was 
both pleased and surprised. 

“You’re quite right, Jack. This is 
the ship that brought Culture X to 
the Solar System.” 

I heard someone — it sounded 
like Eric Fulton — give a gasp of 
incredulity. 

“It’s fantastic! A ship eighteen 
miles across!” 

“You ought to know better than 
that,” replied the Professor, with 
surprising mildness. “Suppose a 
civilization wanted to cross inter- 
stellar space — how else would it at- 
tack the problem? It would build a 
mobile planetoid out in space, tak- 
ing perhaps centuries over the task. 
Since the ship would have to be a 
self-contained world, which could 
support its inhabitants for genera- 
tions, it would need to be as large 
as this. I wonder how many suns 
they visited before they found ours 
and knew that their search was 
ended? They must have had small- 
er ships that could take them down 
to the planets, and of course they 
had to leave the parent vessel some- 
where in space. So they parked it 
here, in a close orbit near the larg- 
est planet, where it would remain 
safely forever — or until they needed 
it again. It was the logical place : if 
they had set it circling the Sun, in 
time the pulls of the planets would 
have disturbed its orbit so much 
that it might have been lost. That 
could never happen to it here.” 

“Tell me, Professor,” someone 
asked, “did you guess all this be- 



fore we started?” 

“I hoped it. All the evidence 
pointed to this answer. There’s al- 
ways been something anomalous 
about Satellite Five, though no one 
seems to have noticed it. Why this 
single tiny moon so close to Jupiter, 
when all the other small satellites 
are seventy times further away? 
Astronomically speaking, it didn’t 
make sense — but enough of this 
chattering. We’ve got work to do.” 

That, I think, must count as the 
understatement of the century. 
There were seven of us, faced with 
the greatest archeological discov- 
ery of all time. Almost a whole 
world — a small world, an artificial 
one, but still a world — was waiting 
for us to explore. All we could per- 
form was a swift and superficial 
reconnaissance: there might be 

material here for generations of re- 
search workers. 

The first step was to lower a 
powerful floodlight on a powerline 
running from the ship. This would 
act as a beacon and prevent us get- 
ting lost, as well as give local il- 
lumination on the inner surface of 
the satellite. (Even now, I still find 
it hard to call Five a ship.) Then 
we dropped down the line to the 
surface below. It was a fall of about 
a mile, and in this low gravity it was 
quite safe to make the drop unre- 
tarded. The gentle shock of the im- 
pact could be absorbed easily 
enough by the spring-loaded staffs 
we carried for that purpose. 

I simply can’t remember what I 
was feeling when we came across 
the first of the great mushroom- 
capped entrance shafts. I suppose 
I was so excited and so over- 
whelmed by the wonder of it all 




14 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



that I’ve forgotten everything else. 
But I can recall the impression of 
sheer size — something which mere 
photographs can never give. The 
builders of this world, coming as 
they did from a planet of low grav- 
ity, were giants — about four times 
as tall as men. We were pigmies 
crawling among their works. 

We never got below the outer 
levels on our first visit, so we met 
few of the scientific marvels which 
later expeditions discovered. That 
was just as well: the residential 
areas provided enough to keep us 
busy for several lifetimes. The globe 
we were exploring must once have 
been lit by artificial sunlight pour- 
ing down from the triple shell that 
surrounded it and kept its atmos- 
phere from leaking into space. Here 
on the surface the Jovians (I sup- 
pose I cannot avoid adopting the 
popular name for the peoples of 
Culture X) had reproduced, as ac- 
curately as they could, conditions 
on the world they had left, un- 
known ages ago. Perhaps they still 
had day and night, changing sea- 
sons, rain and mist. They had even 
taken a tiny sea with them into 
exile. The water was still there, 
forming a frozen lake two miles 
across. I hear that there is a plan 
afoot to electrolize it and provide 
Five with a breathable atmosphere 
again, as soon as the meteor holes 
in the outer shell have been 
plugged. 

The more we saw of their work, 
the more we grew to like and ad- 
mire the race whose possessions we 
were disturbing for the first time in 
five million years. Even if they were 
giants from another sun, they had 
much in common with man, and it 



is a great tragedy that our races 
missed each other by what is, on 
the cosmic scale, such a narrow 
margin. 

We were, I suppose, more for- 
tunate than any archeologists in 
history. The vacuum of space had 
preserved everything from decay 
and — this was something which 
could not have been expected — the 
Jovians had not emptied their 
mighty ship of all its treasures when 
they had set out to colonize the 
Solar System. Here on the inner 
surface of Five everything still 
seemed intact, as it had been at the 
end of the ship’s long journey. Per- 
haps the travelers had preserved it 
as a shrine in memory of their lost 
home — or perhaps they had 
thought that one day they might 
have to use these things again. 

Whatever the reason, everything 
here was as its makers had left it. 
Sometimes it frightened me. I 
might be photographing, with Bill’s 
help, some great wall carving when 
the sheer timelessness of the place 
would strike into my heart. I would 
look round nervously, half expect- 
ing to see giant shapes come stalking 
in through the pointed doorways, to 
continue the tasks that had been 
momentarily interrupted. 

W E DISCOVERED the art gal- 
lery on the fourth day. That 
was the only name for it; there was 
no mistaking its purpose. When 
Groves and Searle, who had been 
doing rapid sweeps over the south- 
ern hemisphere, reported the dis- 
covery we decided to concentrate 
all our forces there. For, as some- 
body or other had said, the art of a 




JUPITER FIVE 



15 



people reveals its soul, and here we 
might find the key to Culture X. 

The building was huge, even by 
the standards of this giant race. 
Like all the other structures on 
Five, it was made of metal, yet there 
was nothing cold or mechanical 
about it. The topmost peak climbed 
half way to the remote roof of the 
world, and from a distance — before 
the details were visible — the build- 
ing looked not unlike a Gothic 
cathedral. Misled by this chance 
resemblance, some later writers 
have called it a temple: but we 
have never found any trace of what 
might be called a religion among 
the Jovians. Yet there seems some- 
thing appropriate about the name 
“The Temple of Art”, and it’s 
stuck so thoroughly that no one 
can change it now. 

It has been estimated that there 
are between ten and twenty million 
individual exhibits in this single 
building — the harvest garnered 
during the whole history of a race 
that may have been much older 
than Man. And it was here that I 
found a small, circular room which 
at first sight seemed to be no more 
than the meeting place of six ra- 
diating corridors. I was by myself 
(and thus, I’m afraid, disobeying 
the Professor’s orders) and taking 
what I thought would be a short- 
cut back to my companions. The 
dark walls were drifting silently 
past me as I glided along, the light 
of my torch dancing over the ceil- 
ing ahead. It was covered with 
deeply cut lettering, and I was so 
busy looking for familiar character 
groupings that for some time I paid 
no attention to the chamber’s floor. 
Then I saw the statue and focussed 



my beam upon it. 

The moment when one first 
meets a great work of art has an 
impact that can never again be re- 
captured. In this case the subject 
matter made the effect all the more 
overwhelming. I was the first man 
ever to know what the Jovians had 
looked like, for here, carved with 
superb skill and authority, was one 
obviously modeled from the life. 

The slender, reptilian head was 
looking straight towards me, the 
sightless eyes staring into mine. 
Two of the hands were clasped 
upon the breast as if in resignation : 
the other two were holding an in- 
strument whose purpose is still un- 
known. The long, powerful tail — 
which, like a kangaroo’s, probably 
balanced the rest of the body — was 
stretched out along the ground, 
adding to the impression of rest or 
repose. 

There was nothing human about 
the face or the body: there were, 
for example, no nostrils — only gill- 
like openings in the neck. Yet the 
figure moved me profoundly: the 
artist had spanned the barriers of 
time and culture in a way I should 
never have believed possible. “Not 
human — but humane” was the ver- 
dict Professor Forster gave. There 
were many things we could not 
have shared with the builders of 
this world, but all that was really 
important we would have felt in 
common. 

Just as one can read emotions in 
the alien but familiar face of a dog 
or a horse, so it seemed that I knew 
the feelings of the being confront- 
ing me. Here was wisdom and au- 
thority — the calm, confident power 
that is shown, for example, in Bel- 




16 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



lini’s famous portrait of the Doge 
Loredano. Yet there was sadness 
also — the sadness of a race which 
had made some stupendous effort, 
and made it in vain. 

We still do not know why this 
single statue is the only representa- 
tion the Jovians have ever made of 
themselves in their art. One would 
hardly expect to find taboos of this 
nature among such an advanced 
race : perhaps we will know the an- 
swer when we have deciphered the 
writing carved on the chamber 
walls. 

Yet I am already certain of the 
statue’s purpose. It was set here 
to bridge time and to greet what- 
ever beings might one day stand in 
the footsteps of its makers. That, 
perhaps, is why they shaped it so 
much smaller than life. Even then 
they must have guessed that the fu- 
ture belonged to Earth or Venus, 
and hence to beings whom they 
would have dwarfed. They knew 
that size could be a barrier as well 
as time. 

A few minutes later I was on my 
way back to the ship with my com- 
panions, eager to tell the Professor 
about the discovery. He had been 
reluctantly snatching some rest, 
though I don’t believe he averaged 
more than four hours sleep a day 
all the time we were on Five. The 
golden light of Jupiter was flooding 
the great metal plain as we emerged 
through the shell and stood beneath 
the stars once more. 

“Hello!” I heard Bill say over 
the radio, “the Prof’s moved the 
ship.” 

“Nonsense,” I retorted. “It’s ex- 
actly where we left it.” 

Then I turned my head and saw 



the reason for Bill’s mistake. We 
had visitors. 



T HE SECOND ship had come 
down a couple of miles away, 
and as far as my non-expert eyes 
could tell it might have been a 
duplicate of ours. When we hurried 
through the airlock, we found that 
the Professor, a little bleary-eyed, 
was already entertaining. To our 
surprise, though not exactly to our 
displeasure, one of the three visitors 
was an extremely attractive bru- 
nette. 

“This,” said Professor Forster, 'a 
little wearily, “is Mr. Randolph 
Mays, the science writer. I imagine 
you’ve heard of him. And this is — ” 
he turned to Mays. “I’m afraid I 
didn’t quite catch the names.” 

“My pilot, Donald Hopkins — 
my secretary, Marianne Mitchell.” 
There was just the slightest pause 
before the word “secretary”, but it 
was long enough to set a little sig- 
nal light flashing in my brain. I kept 
my eyebrows from going up, but I 
caught a glance from Bill that said, 
without any need for words “If 
you’re thinking what I’m thinking, 
I’m ashamed of you.” 

Mays was a tall, rather cadaver- 
ous man with thinning hair and an 
attitude of bonhomie which one 
felt was only skin deep — the protec- 
tive coloration of a man who has to 
be friendly with too many people. 

“I expect this is as big a surprise 
to you as it is to me,” he said with 
unnecessary heartiness. “I certainly 
never expected to find anyone here 
before me — and I certainly didn’t 
expect to find all this” 

“What brought you here?” said 




JUPITER FIVE 



17 



Ashton, trying to sound not too 
suspiciously inquisitive. 

“I was just explaining that to 
the Professor. Can I have that 
folder please, Marianne? Thanks.” 

He drew out a series of very fine 
astronomical paintings and passed 
them round. They showed the 
planets from their satellites — a com- 
mon enough subject, of course. 

“You’ve all seen this sort of thing 
before,” Mays continued. “But 
there’s a difference here. These pic- 
tures are nearly a hundred years, 
old: they were painted by an art- 
ist named Chesley Bonestell and 
appeared in Life back in 1944 — 
long before space travel began, of 
course. Now what’s happened is 
that Life has commissioned me to 
go round the Solar System and see 
how well I can match these imag- 
inative paintings against the reality. 
In the centenary issue, they’ll be 
published side by side with photo- 
graphs of the real thing. Good idea, 
eh?” 

I had to admit that it was. But 
it was going to make matters rather 
complicated, and I wondered wha$ 
the Professor thought about it. 
Then I glanced again at Miss 
Mitchell, standing demurely in the 
corner, and decided that there 
would be compensations. 

In any other circumstances, we 
would have been glad to meet an- 
other party of explorers, but here 
there was the question of priority 
to be considered. Mays would cer- 
tainly be hurrying back to Earth as 
quickly as he could, his original 
mission abandoned, and all his films 
used up here and now. It was diffi- 
cult to see how we could stop him, 
and not even certain that we de- 



sired to do so. We wanted all the 
publicity and support we could get 
— but we would prefer to do things 
in our own time, after our own 
fashion. I wondered how strong the 
Professor was on tact, and feared 
the worst. 

Yet, at first, diplomatic relations 
were smooth enough. The Professor 
had hit on the bright idea of pair- 
ing each of us with one of Mays’ 
team, so that we acted simulta- 
neously as guides and supervisors. 
Doubling the number of investigat- 
ing groups also greatly increased 
the rate at which we could work. 
It was unsafe for anyone to operate 
by himself under these conditions, 
and this had handicapped us a good 
deal. 

The Professor outlined his policy 
to us the day after the arrival of 
Mays’ party. 

“I hope we can get along to- 
gether,” he said a little anxiously. 
“As far as I’m concerned they can 
go where they like and photograph 
what they like — as long as they 
don’t take anything, and as long as 
they don’t get back to Earth with 
their records before we do.” 

“I don’t see how we can stop 
them,” protested Ashton. 

“Well, I hadn’t intended to do 
this, but I’ve now registered a claim 
to Five. I radioed it to Ganymede 
last night, and it will be at The 
Hague by now.” 

“But no one can claim an astro- 
nomical body for himself. That was 
settled in the case of the Moon, 
back in the last century.” 

The Professor gave a rather 
crooked smile. 

“I’m not annexing an astronomi- 
cal body , remember. I’ve put in a 




18 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



claim for salvage, and I’ve done it 
in the name of the World Science 
Organization. If Mays takes any- 
thing out of Five, he’ll be stealing 
it from them. Tomorrow I’m going 
to explain the situation gently to 
him, just in case he gets any bright 
ideas.” 

It certainly seemed peculiar to 
think of Satellite Five as salvage, 
and I could imagine some pretty 
legal quarrels developing when we 
got home. But for the present the 
Professor’s move should have given 
us some safeguards and might dis- 
courage Mays from collecting 
souvenirs — so we were optimistic 
enough to hope. 

I T TOOK rather a lot of organ- 
izing, but I managed to get paired 
off with Marianne for several trips 
round the interior of Five. Mays 
didn’t seem to mind : there was no 
particular reason why he should. A 
space-suit is the most perfect chap- 
eron ever devised, confound it! 

Naturally enough, I took her to 
the art gallery at the first oppor- 
tunity, and showed her my find. 
She stood looking at the statue for 
a long time while I held my torch 
beam upon it. 

“It’s very wonderful,” she 
breathed at last. “Just think of it — 
waiting here in the darkness all 
those millions of years! But you’ll 
have to give it a name.” 

“I have. I’ve christened it ‘The 
Ambassador’.” 

“Why?” 

“Well, because I think it’s a kind 
of envoy, if you like, carrying a 
greeting to us. The people who 
made it knew that one day some- 



one else was bound to come here 
and find this place.” 

“I think you’re right. ‘The Am- 
bassador* — yes, that was clever of 
you. There’s something noble about 
it — and something very sad, too. 
Don’t you feel it?” 

I could tell that Marianne was a 
veij intelligent woman : it was 

quite remarkable the way she saw 
my point of view, and the interest 
she took in everything I showed 
her. But The Ambassador fas- 
cinated her most of all, and she 
kept on coming back to it. 

“You know, Jack,” she said (I 
think this was sometime the next 
day, when Mays had been to see it 
as well) “you must take that statue 
back to Earth. Think of the sensa- 
tion it would cause.” 

I sighed. 

“The Professor would like to, 
but it must weigh a ton. We can’t 
afford the fuel. It will have to wait 
for a later trip.” 

She looked puzzled. 

“But things hardly weigh any- 
thing here,” she protested. 

“That’s different,” I explained. 
“There’s weight, and there’s iner- 
tia — two quite different things. 
Now inertia — oh, never mind. We 
can’t take it back, anyway. Captain 
Searle’s told us that, definitely.” 
“What a pity,” said Marianne. 
I forgot all about this conversa- 
tion until the night before we left. 
We had had a busy and exhausting 
day packing our equipment (a 
good deal, of course, we left behind 
for future use). All our photo- 
graphic material had been used 
up: as Charlie Ashton remarked, 
if we met a live Jovian now we’d 
be unable to record the fact. I 




JUPITER FIVE 



19 



think we all wanted a breathing 
space, an opportunity to relax and 
sort out our impressions and to re- 
cover from our head-on collision 
with an alien culture. 

Mays’ ship, the Henry Luce , was 
also nearly ready for take-off. We 
would leave at the same time, an 
arrangement which suited the Pro- 
fessor admirably as he did not trust 
Mays alone on Five. 

Everything had been settled 
when, while checking through our 
records, I suddenly found that six 
rolls of exposed film were missing. 
They were photographs of a com- 
plete set of transcriptions in the 
Temple of Art. After a certain 
amount of thought I recalled that 
they had been entrusted to my 
charge, and I had put them very 
carefully on a ledge in the Temple, 
intending to collect them later. 

It was a long time before take- 
off, the Professor and Ashton were 
canceling some arrears of sleep, and 
there seemed no reason why I 
should not slip back to collect the 
missing material. I knew there 
would be a row if it was left be- 
hind, and as I remembered exactly 
where it was I need be gone only 
thirty minutes. So I went, explain- 
ing my mission to Bill just in case 
of accidents. 

The floodlight was no longer 
working, of course, and the dark- 
ness inside the shell of Five was 
somewhat oppressive. But I left a 
portable beacon at the entrance, 
and dropped freely until my hand- 
torch told me it .was time to break 
the fall. Ten minutes later, with a 
sigh of relief, I gathered up the 
missing films. 

It was a natural enough thing to 



pay my last respects to The Ambas- 
sador: it might be years before I 
saw him again, and that calmly 
enigmatic figure had begun to ex- 
ercise an extraordinary fascination 
over me. 

Unfortunately, that fascination 
had not been confined to me alone. 
For the chamber was empty and 
the statue gone. 

I suppose I could have crept 
back and said nothing, thus avoid- 
ing awkward explanations. But I 
was too furious to think of discre- 
tion, and as soon as I returned we 
woke the Professor and told him 
what had happened. 

He sat on his bunk rubbing the 
sleep out of his eyes, then uttered 
a few harsh words about Mr. Mays 
and his companions which it would 
do no good at all to repeat here. 

“What I don’t understand,” said 
Searle “is how they got the thing 
out — if they have, in fact. We 
should have spotted it.” 

“There are plenty of hiding 
places — and they could have waited 
until there was no one around be- 
fore they took it up through the 
hull. It must have been quite a 
job, even under this gravity,” re- 
marked Eric Fulton, in tones of ad- 
miration. 

“There’s no time for post- 
mortems,” said the Professor sav- 
agely. “We’ve got five hours to 
think of something. They can’t take 
off before then, because we’re only 
just past opposition with Gany- 
mede. That’s correct, isn’t it Kings- 
ley?” 

Searle nodded agreement. 

“Yes. We must move round to 
the other side of Jupiter before we 
can enter a transfer orbit — at least, 




20 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



a reasonably economical one.” 
“Good. That gives us a breathing 
space. Well — has anyone any 

ideas?” 

Looking back on the whole thing 
now, it often seems to me that our 
subsequent behavior was, shall I 
say, a little peculiar and slightly un- 
civilized. It was not the sort of 
thing we could have imagined our- 
selves doing a few months before. 
But we were annoyed and over- 
wrought, and our remoteness from 
all other human beings somehow 
made everything seem different. 
Since there was no other law here, 
we had to make it. 

“Can’t we do something to stop 
them taking off? Could we sabo- 
tage their rockets, for instance?” 
asked Bill. 

Searle didn’t like this idea at all. 
“We mustn’t do anything dras- 
tic,” he said. “Besides, Don Hop- 
kins is a good friend of mine. He’d 
never forgive me if I damaged his 
ship. There’d be the danger, too, 
that we might do something that 
couldn’t be repaired.” 

“Then pinch their fuel,” said 
Groves laconically. 

“Of course! They’re probably all 
asleep — there’s no light in the cab- 
in. All we’ve got to do is to con- 
nect up and pump.” 

“A very nice idea,” I pointed out 
“but we’re nearly two miles apart. 
How much pipeline have we got?” 
The others ignored this interrup- 
tion as if it was beneath contempt 
and went on making their plans. 
Five minutes later the technicians 
had settled everything: we only 
had to climb into our space-suits 
and do the work. 



I NEVER thought, when I joined 
the Professor’s expedition, that I 
should end up like an African 
porter in one of those old adven- 
ture stories, carrying a load on my 
head. Especially when that load 
was a sixth of a spaceship (being 
so short, Professor Forster wasn’t 
able to provide very effective 
help.) Now that its fuel tanks were 
half empty, the weight of the ship, 
in this gravity, was about 450 
pounds. We all squeezed under- 
neath, heaved, and up she went — 
very slowly, of course, because her 
inertia was still unchanged. Then 
we started marching. 

It took us quite a while to make 
the journey, and it wasn’t as easy 
as we’d thought it would be. But 
presently the two ships were lying 
side by side, and nobody had no- 
ticed us. Everyone in the Henry 
Luce was fast asleep, as they had 
every reason to expect us to be. 

Though I was still rather short of 
breath, I found a certain schoolboy 
amusement in the whole adventure 
as Searle and Fulton drew the re- 
fueling pipeline out of our airlock 
and quietly coupled up to the other 
ship. 

“The beauty of this plan,” ex- 
plained Groves to me as we stood 
watching, “is that they can’t do 
anything to stop us, unless they 
come outside and uncouple our 
line. We can drain them dry in 
five minutes — and it will take them 
half that time to wake up and get 
into their space-suits.” 

A sudden horrid fear smote me. 
“Suppose they turned on their 
rockets and tried to get away?” 
“Then we’d both be smashed up. 
No — they’ll just have to come out- 




21 



JUPITER FIVE 

side and see what’s going on. Ah, 
there go the pumps.” 

The pipeline had stiffened like a 
fire-hose under pressure, and I 
knew that the fuel was pouring 
into our tanks. Any moment now 
the lights would go on in the 
Henry Luce and her startled occu- 
pants would come scuttling out. 

It was something of an anticli- 
max when they didn’t. They must 
have been sleeping very soundly not 
to have felt the vibration from the 
pumps, but when it was all over 
nothing had happened and we just 
stood round looking rather foolish. 
Searle and Fulton carefully uncou- 
pled the pipeline and put it back 
into the airlock. 

“Well?” we asked the Professor. 

He thought things over for a 
minute. 

“Let’s get back into the ship,” 
he said. 

When we had climbed out of our 
suits and were gathered together in 
the control room, or as far in as we 
could get, the Professor sat down 
at the radio and punched out the 
Emergency signal. Our sleeping 
neighbors would be awake in a 
couple of seconds as their automat- 
ic receiver sounded the alarm. 

The TV screen glimmered into 
life. There, looking rather fright- 
ened, was Randolph Mays. 

“Hello, Forster,” he snapped. 
“What’s the trouble?” 

“Nothing wrong here,” replied 
the Professor in his best dead-pan 
manner, “but you’ve lost something 
important. Look at your fuel 
gauges.” 

The screen emptied, and for a 
moment there was a confused 
mumbling and shouting from the 



speaker. Then Mays was back, an- 
noyance and alarm competing for 
possession of his features. 

“What’s going on?” he de- 
manded angrily. “Do you know 
anything about this?” 

The Prof, let him sizzle for a 
moment before he replied. 

“I think you’d better come across 
and talk things over,” he said. “You 
won’t have far to walk.” 

Mays glared back at him uncer- 
tainly, then retorted “You bet I 
will!” The screen went blank. 

“He’ll have to climb down now!” 
said Bill gleefully. “There’s nothing 
else he can do!” 

“It’s not so simple as you think,” 
warned Fulton. “If he really wanted 
to be awkward, he could just sit 
tight and radio Ganymede for a 
tanker.” 

“What good would that do him? 
It would waste days and cost a for- 
tune.” 

“Yes, but he’d still have the 
statue, if he wanted it that badly. 
And he’d get his money back when 
he sued us.” 

The airlock light flashed on and 
Mays stumped into the room. He 
was in a surprisingly conciliatory 
mood: on the way over, he must 
have had second thoughts. 

“Well, well,” he said affably. 
“What’s all this nonsense in aid 
of?” 

“You know perfectly well,” the 
Professor retorted coldly. “I made 
it quite clear that nothing was to 
be taken off Five. You’ve been 
stealing property that doesn’t be- 
long to you.” 

“Now let’s be reasonable. Who 
does it belong to? You can’t claim 
everything on this planet as your 




22 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



personal property.” 

“This is not a planet — it’s a ship 
and the laws of salvage operate.” 

“Frankly, that’s a very debatable 
point. Don’t you think you should 
wait until you get a ruling from the 
lawyers?” 

The Professor was being icily po- 
lite, but I could see that the strain 
was terrific and an explosion might 
occur any moment. 

“Listen, Mr. Mays,” he said 
with ominous calm. “What you’ve 
taken is the most important single 
find we’ve made here. I will make 
allowances for the fact that you 
don’t appreciate what you’ve done, 
and don’t understand the view- 
point of an archeologist like my- 
self. Return that statue, and we’ll 
pump your fuel back and say no 
more.” 

Mays rubbed his chin thought- 
fully. 

“I really don’t see why you 
should make such a fuss about one 
statue, when you consider all the 
stuff that’s still here.” 

It was then that the Professor 
made one of his rare mistakes. 

“You talk like a man who’s stol- 
en the Mona Lisa from the Louvre 
and argues that nobody will miss it 
because of all the other paintings. 
This statue’s unique in a way that 
no terrestrial work of art can ever 
be. That’s why I’m determined to 
get it back.” 

You should never, when you’re 
bargaining, make it obvious that 
you want something really badly. I 
saw the greedy glint in Mays’ eye 
and said to myself “Uh-huh! He’s 
going to be tough.” And I remem- 
bered Fulton’s remark about call- 
ing Ganymede for a tanker. 



“Give me half an hour to think 
it over,” said Mays, turning to the 
airlock. 

“Very well,” replied the Profes- 
sor stiffly. “Half an hour — no 
more.” 

I must give Mays credit for 
brains. Within five minutes we saw 
his communications aerial start 
slewing round until it locked on 
Ganymede. Naturally we tiied to 
listen in, but he had a scrambler. 
These newspaper men must trust 
each other. 

The reply came back a few min- 
utes later : that was scrambled, too. 
While we were waiting for the next 
development, we had another 
council of war. The Professor was 
now entering the stubborn, stop-at- 
nothing stage : he realized he’d mis- 
calculated and that had made him 
fighting mad. 

I think Mays must have been a 
little apprehensive, because he had 
reinforcements when he returned. 
Donald Hopkins, his pilot, came 
with him, looking rather uncom- 
fortable. 

“I’ve been able to fix things up, 
Professor,” he said smugly. “It will 
take me a little longer, but I can 
get back without your help if I 
have to. Still, I must admit that it 
will save a good deal of time and 
money if we can come to an agree- 
ment. I’ll tell you what. Give me 
back my fuel and I’ll return the 
other — er — souvenirs I’ve collect- 
ed. But I insist on keeping Mona 
Lisa, even if it means I won’t get 
back to Ganymede until the mid- 
dle of next week.” 

The Professor then uttered a 
number of what are usually called 
deep-space oaths, though I can as- 




JUPITER FIVE 



23 



sure you they’re much the same as 
any other oaths. That seemed to 
relieve his feelings a lot and he be- 
came fiendishly friendly. 

“My dear Mr. Mays,” he said, 
“you’re an unmitigated crook, and 
accordingly I’ve no compunction 
left in dealing with you. I’m pre- 
pared to use force, knowing that 
the law will justify me.” 

Mays looked slightly alarmed, 
though not unduly so. We had 
moved to strategic positions round 
the door. 

“Please don’t be melodramatic,” 
he said haughtily. 

“I must ask you,” the Professor 
continued, “to consider yourself un- 
der detention while we decide what 
is to be done. Mr. Searle, take him 
to Cabin B.” 

Mays sidled along the wall with 
a nervous laugh. 

“Really, Professor, this is too 
childish! You can’t detain me 
against my will.” He glanced for 
support at the captain of the Hen- 
ry Luce . 

Donald Hopkins dusted an 
imaginary speck of fluff from his 
uniform. 

“I refuse,” he remarked for the 
benefit of all concerned, “to get in- 
volved in vulgar brawls.” 

Mays gave him a venomous look 
and capitulated with bad grace. We 
saw that he had a good supply of 
reading matter, and locked him in. 

When he was out of the way, the 
Professor turned to Hopkins, who 
was looking enviously at our fuel 
gauges. 

“Can I take it, Captain,” he said 
politely, “that you don’t wish to get 
mixed up in any of your employer’s 
dirty business?” 



“I’m neutral. My job is to fly the 
ship here and take her home. You 
can fight this out among your- 
selves.” 

“Thank you: I think we under- 
stand each other perfectly. Perhaps 
it would be best if you returned to 
your ship and explained the situ- 
ation. We’ll be calling you in a few 
minutes.” 

Captain Hopkins made his way 
languidly to the door. As he was 
about to leave he turned to Searle. 

“By the way, Kingsley,” he 
drawled. “Have you thought of tor- 
ture? Do call me if you get round 
to it — I’ve some jolly interesting 
ideas.” Then he was gone, leaving 
us with our hostage. 



I THINK the Professor had hoped 
he could do a direct exchange. 
If so, he had not bargained on 
Marianne’s stubbornness. 

“It serves Randolph right,” she 
said. “But I don’t really see that it 
makes any difference. He’ll be just 
as comfortable in your ship as in 
ours, and you can’t do anything to 
him. Let me know when you’re fed 
up with having him around.” 

It seemed a complete impasse. 
We had been too clever by half, 
and it had got us exactly nowhere. 
We’d captured Mays, but he wasn’t 
any use to us. 

The Professor was standing with 
his back to us, staring morosely out 
of the window. Seemingly balanced 
on the horizon, the immense bulk 
of Jupiter nearly filled the sky. 

“We’ve got to convince her that 
we really do mean business,” he 
said. Then he turned abruptly to 
me. 




24 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



“Do you think she’s actually fond 
of this blackguard?” 

“Er — I shouldn’t be surprised. 
Yes, I really believe so.” 

The Professor looked very 
thoughtful. Then he said to Searle : 
“Come into my room. I want to 
talk something over.” 

They were gone quite a while. 
When they returned, they both had 
an indefinable air of gleeful antici- 
pation, and the Professor was car- 
rying a piece of paper covered with 
figures. He went to the radio and 
called the Henry Luce . 

“Hello,” said Marianne, reply- 
ing so promptly that she’d obvious- 
ly been waiting for us. “Have you 
decided to call it off? I’m getting 
so bored.” 

The Professor looked at her 
gravely. 

“Miss Mitchell,” he replied. “It’s 
apparent that you have not been 
taking us seriously. I’m therefore 
arranging a somewhat — er — drastic 
little demonstration for your bene- 
fit. I’m going to place your employ- 
er in a position from which he’ll be 
only too anxious for you to retrieve 
him as quickly as possible.” 

“Indeed?” replied Marianne 
non-committally — though I thought 
I could detect a trace of apprehen- 
sion in her voice. 

“I don’t suppose,” continued the 
Professor smoothly, “that you know 
anything about celestial mechanics 
. No? Too bad, but your pilot 
will confirm everything I tell you. 
Won’t you, Hopkins?” 

“Go ahead,” came a painstak- 
ingly neutral voice from the back- 
ground. 

“Then listen carefully, Miss 
Mitchell. I want to remind you of 



our curious — indeed our precari- 
ous — position on this satellite. 
You’ve only got to look out of the 
window to see how close to Jupiter 
we are, and I need hardly remind 
you that Jupiter has by far the 
most intense gravitational field of 
all the planets. You follow me?” 
“Yes,” replied Marianne, no 
longer quite so self-possessed. “Go 
on.” 

“Very well. This little world of 
ours goes round Jupiter in almost 
exactly twelve hours. Now there’s 
a well-known theorem stating that 
if a body falls from an orbit to the 
center of attraction, it will take 
point one seven seven of a period 
to make the drop. In other words, 
anything falling from here to Jupi- 
ter would reach the centre of the 
planet in about two hours seven 
minutes. I’m sure Captain Hopkins 
can confirm this.” 

There was a long pause. Then 
we heard Hopkins say: 

“Well, of course I can’t confirm 
the exact figures, but they’re prob- 
ably correct. It would be something 
like that, anyway.” 

“Good,” continued the Profes- 
sor. “Now I’m sure you realize,” 
he went on with a hearty chuckle, 
“that a fall to the center of the 
planet is a very theoretical case. If 
anything really was dropped from 
here, it would reach the upper at- 
mosphere of Jupiter in a consider- 
ably shorter time. I hope I’m not 
boring you?” 

“No,” said Marianne, rather 
faintly. 

“I’m so glad to hear it. Anyway, 
Captain Searle has worked out the 
actual time for me, and it’s one 
hour thirty five minutes — with a

Mays found himself ascending help- 
lessly toward the ominous bulk of 
Jupiter .

ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



few minutes either way. We can’t 
guarantee complete accuracy, ha, 
ha! 

“Now it has doubtlessly not es- 
caped your notice that this satellite 
of ours has an extremely weak 
gravitational field. Its escape ve- 
locity is only about thirty-five feet 
a second, and anything thrown 
away from it at that speed would 
never come back. Correct, Mr. 
Hopkins?” 

“Perfectly correct.” 

“Then, if I may come to the 
point, we propose to take Mr. 
Mays for a walk until he’s immedi- 
ately under Jupiter, remove the re- 
action pistols from his suit, and — 
ah — launch him forth. We will be 
prepared to retrieve him with our 
ship as soon as you’ve handed over 
the property you’ve stolen. After 
what I’ve told you, I’m sure you’ll 
appreciate that time will be rather 
vital. An hour and thirty-five min- 
utes is remarkably short, isn’t it?” 
“Professor!” I gasped. “You 
can’t possibly do this.” 

“Shut up!” he barked. “Well, 
Miss Mitchell, what about it?” 
Marianne was staring at him 
with mingled horror and disbelief. 

“You’re simply bluffing,” she 
cried. “I don’t believe you’d do 
anything of the kind! Your crew 
won’t let you!” 

The Professor sighed. 

“Too bad,” he said. “Captain 
Searle — Mr. Groves — will you take 
the prisoner and proceed as in- 
structed.” 

“Aye-aye, sir,” replied Searle 
with great solemnity. 

Mays looked frightened but 
stubborn. 

“What are you going to do 



now?” he said, as his suit was 
handed back to him. 

Searle unholstered his reaction 
pistols. “Just climb in,” he said. 
“We’re going for a walk.” 

I realized then what the Profes- 
sor hoped to do. The whole thing 
was a colossal bluff: of course he 
wouldn’t really have Mays thrown 
into Jupiter — and in any case 
Searle and Groves wouldn’t do it. 
Surely Marianne would see 
through the bluff and then we’d 
be left looking mighty foolish. 

Mays couldn’t run away: with- 
out his reaction pistols he was quite 
helpless. Grasping his arms and 
towing him along like a captive 
balloon, his escorts set off towards 
the horizon — and towards Jupiter. 

I could see, looking across the 
space to the other ship, that Mari- 
anne was staring out through the 
observation windows at the depart- 
ing trio. Professor Forster noticed 
it too. 

“I hope you’re convinced, Miss 
Mitchell, that my men aren’t car- 
rying along an empty space-suit. 
Might I suggest that you follow the 
proceedings with a telescope? 
They’ll be over the horizon in a 
minute, but you’ll be able to see 
Mr. Mays when he starts to — er — 
ascend.” 

There was a stubborn silence 
from the loudspeaker. The period 
of suspense seemed to last for a 
very long time. Was Marianne 
waiting to see how far the Profes- 
sor really would go? 

By this time I had got hold of a 
pair of binoculars and was sweep- 
ing the sky beyond the ridiculously 
close horizon. Suddenly I saw it — a 
tiny flare of light against the vast 




JUPITER FIVE 



27 



yellow back-cloth of Jupiter. I fo- 
cussed quickly, and could just make 
out the three figures rising into 
space. As I watched, they sepa- 
rated : two of them decelerated 
with their pistols and started to fall 
back towards Five. The other went 
on ascending helplessly towards the 
ominous bulk of Jupiter. 

I turned on the Professor in hor- 
ror and disbelief. 

“They’ve really done it!” I cried. 
“I thought you were only bluff- 
ing!” 

“So did Miss Mitchell, I’ve no 
doubt,” said the Professor calmly, 
for the benefit of the listening mi- 
crophone. “I hope I don’t need to 
impress upon you the urgency of 
the situation. As I’ve remarked 
once or twice before, the time of 
fall from our orbit to Jupiter’s sur- 
face is ninety-five minutes. But, of 
course, if one waited even half that 
time, it would be much too 
late . .” 

He let that sink in. There was 
no reply from the other ship. 

“And now,” he continued, “I’m 
going to switch off our receiver so 
we can’t have any more arguments. 
We’ll wait until you’ve unloaded 
that statue — and the other items 
Mr. Mays was careless enough to 
mention — before we’ll talk to you 
again. Good-bye.” 

I T WAS a very uncomfortable ten 
minutes. I’d lost track of Mays, 
and was seriously wondering if 
we’d better overpower the Profes- 
sor and go after him before we had 
a murder on our hands. But the 
people who could fly the ship were 
the ones who had actually carried 



out the crime. I didn’t know what 
to think. 

Then the airlock of the Henry 
Luce slowly opened. A couple of 
space-suited figures emerged, float- 
ing the cause of all the trouble be- 
tween them. 

“Unconditional surrender,” mur- 
mured the Professor with a sigh of 
satisfaction. “Get it into our ship,” 
he called over the radio, “I’ll open 
up the airlock for you.” 

He seemed in no hurry at all. I 
kept looking anxiously at the clock 
— fifteen minutes had already gone 
by. Presently there was a clanking 
and banging in the airlock, the in- 
ner door opened, and Captain 
Hopkins entered. He was followed 
by Marianne, who only needed a 
bloodstained axe to make her look 
like Glytaemnestra. I did my best 
to avoid her eye, but the Professor 
seemed to be quite without shame. 
He walked into the airlock, 
checked that his property was 
back, and emerged rubbing his 
hands. 

“Well, that’s that,” he said 
cheerfully. “Now let’s sit down and 
have a drink to forget all this un- 
pleasantness, shall we?” 

I pointed indignantly at the 
clock. 

“Have you gone crazy!” I yelled. 
“He’s already half-way to Jupiter!” 

Professor Forster looked at me 
disapprovingly. 

“Impatience,” he said, “is a 
common failing in the young. I see 
no cause at all for hasty action.” 

Marianne spoke for the first 
time : she now looked really scared. 

“But you promised,” she whis- 
pered. 

The Professor suddenly capitu- 




28 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



lated. He had had his little joke, 
and didn’t want to prolong the 
agony. 

“I can tell you at once, Miss 
Mitchell — and you too. Jack — that 
Mays is in no more danger than we 
are. We can go and collect him 
whenever we like.” 

“Do you mean that you lied to 
me?” 

“Certainly not. Everything I told 
you was perfectly true. You simply 
jumped to the wrong conclusions. 
When I said that a body would 
take ninety-five minutes to fall 
from here to Jupiter, I omitted — 
not, I must confess, accidentally — 
a rather important phrase. I should 
have added “a body at rest with 
respect to Jupiter .” Your friend 
Mr. Mays was sharing the orbital 
speed of this satellite — and he’s still 
got it. A little matter of sixteen 
miles a second, Miss Mitchell. 

“Oh yes, we threw him com- 
pletely off Five and towards Jupi- 
ter. But the velocity we gave him 
then was trivial. He’s still moving 
in practically the same orbit as be- 
fore. The most he can do — I’ve got 
Captain Searle to work out the fig- 
ures — is to drift about sixty miles 
inward. And ‘in one revolution — 
twelve hours — he'll be right back 
where he started, without us both- 
ering to do anything at all.” 

There was a long, long silence. 
Marianne’s face was a study in 
frustration, relief, and annoyance 
at having been fooled. Then she 
turned on Captain Hopkins. 

“You must have known all the 
time! Why didn’t you tell me?” 

Hopkins gave her a wounded ex- 
pression. 

“You didn’t ask me,” he said. 



W E HAULED Mays down about 
an hour later. He was only fif- 
teen miles up, and we located him 
quickly enough by the flashing 
light on his suit. His radio had 
been disconnected, for a reason 
that hadn’t occurred to me. He was 
intelligent enough to realize that he 
was in no danger, and if his set had 
been working he could have called 
his ship and exposed our bluff. 
That is, if he wanted to. Personally, 
I think I’d have been glad enough 
to call the whole thing off even if 
I had known that I was perfectly 
safe. It must have been awfully 
lonely up there. To my great sur- 
prise, Mays wasn’t as mad as I’d 
expected. Perhaps he was too re- 
lieved to be back in our snug little 
cabin when we drifted up to him 
on the merest fizzle of rockets and 
yanked him in. Or perhaps he felt 
that he’d been worsted in fair fight 
and didn’t bear any grudge. 

There isn’t much more to tell — 
except that we did play one other 
trick on him before we left Five. 
He had a good deal more fuel in his 
tanks than he really needed, noW 
that his payload was substantially 
reduced. By keeping the excess our- 
selves, we were able to carry the 
Ambassador back to Ganymede 
after all. Oh, yes, the Professor 
gave him a check for the fuel 
we’d borrowed. Everything was 
perfectly legal. 

There’s one amusing sequel I 
must tell you, though. The day aft- 
er the new gallery was opened at 
the British Museum I went along 
to see The Ambassador, partly to 
discover if his impact was still as 
great in these changed surround-

O UTSIDE, the bluish sun slanted 
low across the green dust of the 
Martian desert, its last rays spar- 
kling on the far mountain tops. 
One by one, lights flickered on in 
the city. 

Mary must be expecting that 
Earthman,” Anne said. She held 
her glastic blouse tight together 
over her breasts and leaned a little 
out of the window. 

Milly nodded. “The Azmuth 
landed this morning.” 

The noises of commerce were 
fading. From the window Anne 
saw the neon blaze up over the 
door. For the thousandth time she 
blinked between the equivocal 
words: 30— BEAUTIFUL HOST- 
ESSES — 30. Laughter, dry and 
false, filtered up from the tea bars 
along the street. She looked west- 
ward, toward the spaceport, and 
made out the shadowy nose of the 
berthed space liner looming against 
the night. She could picture the 



scene — a thousand stevedores un- 
loading cargo, refill men and na- 
tive spacewriters scurrying over the 
sleek hull, the Earth voyageurs 
shouting orders and curses. 

“Maybe he isn’t even on it.” 
Anne turned from the window. She 
crossed to the couch and sat down, 
fluffing out the green crinkly glass 
of her skirt; pendant, multicolored 
birds flashed from the rings in her 
ears. She tucked rosy feet under 
her scented body. “I don’t like 
Earthmen,” she said. 

“They spend money.” 

“They make me sick,” Anne 
said. “With their pale skins and 
ugly eyes and hairy bodies.” 

“They have strong arms.” 

Anne’s wide, red mouth curled 
in distaste. “They’re like a bunch 
of kids.” 

The room was lighted by soft, 
overhead fire. Heavy drapes hung 
from the walls. Sweet, spicy incense 
curled bluely from the burners by

the window. 

Before the mirror, Milly edged 
in the narrow line of her pink eye- 
brows with a pencil. She folded 
her lips in, rubbing them together, 
licked them, making them a glis- 
tening red. She pinched her cheeks. 

“I wonder when they’ll catch 
Crescent?” she said. 

Anne yawned languorously. “It 
won’t be long.” 

“I wouldn’t want to be in her 
shoes,” Milly said. 

Anne patted her mouth lazily. 
“She ought to have known she 
couldn’t run away.” 

“What do you think Miss Bestris 
will do to her?” 

Anne stood up, brushing out the 
wrinkles in her dress. “I should 
care.” 

“But what will she do?” 

Anne shrugged. “Whip her, 
maybe. How should I know?” 
“Don’t you feel you’d like to run 
away, once in a while?” Milly 
asked, turning to look at the other 
girl. 

Anne laughed coldly. “I’ve got 
better sense.” 

“But don’t you want to?” 

Anne tossed her purple hair. 
“Where is there to go? Who is 
there to go to?” 

“Yes. I guess you’re right.” 
Milly turned back to her reflection. 

Buzzzzzz. 

Both girls turned their heads to 
the buttons on the wall. The white 
one was glowing. 

“It’s Miss Bestris.” 

“We’d better go,” Milly said. 
Together they walked down the 
heavily carpeted stairs to the sit- 
ting room. 

The Madame was waiting. She 



was a large woman, rolling in 
creases of fat, and her pink hair 
was rough and clipped short. She 
had a pair of dimples in her cheeks 
and a single gold band around her 
right wrist. She was leaning against 
the piano. 

“Hurry now, girls, hurry right 
along,” she said. 

More girls were entering the 
room; they spread out, sitting on 
the chairs, curling at the Madame’s 
feet. Their eyes — amethyst, gray or 
golden — were on her face. Many 
had pink hair, others had tresses of 
purple or salmon. 

“Now, girls, I suppose you know 
there’s an Earth ship in port?” 
The girls nodded. 

“So I expect we’ll have visitors 
tonight. I want you to all look your 
very best.” She smiled at them. 
“Anne, why don’t you wear that 
low-cut, orange plastic with the 
spangles, and June, you the prim 
white one? You look like an angel 
in it.” June smiled. “And 
Mary . ?” 

“Yes, Miss Bestris?” 

“Mary. Did you buy that neo- 
nylon I told you about?” 

“No, Miss Bestris.” 

“Mary, Mary, Mary. I just don’t 
understand you at all.” 

“I’m saving my money, Miss 
Bestris,” Mary said intently. 

“Yes, dear, I know that. We’re 
all saving our money. But we sim- 
ply must look presentable. We have 
a reputation to hold up.” 

“Yes, Miss Bestris.” 

“Then, Mary, dear, d6 — do, 
please , buy yourself something de- 
cent.” 

“Yes, Miss Bestris. I will. To- 




32 



KRIS NEVILLE 



morrow. Tomorrow morning, if 

I . .” 

“Child? If you what?” 

“Nothing, Miss Bestris.” 

“Well. See that you get it tomor- 
row. If you don’t, I’m afraid I’ll 
have to take some of your money 
and get it for you.” 

Mary looked down at the floor. 
The flaming glow of the hydrojet 
torches cast golden lights in her 
softly purple hair. 

“By the way, Mary. Is that your 
cake in the oven?” 

“Yes, Miss Bestris.” 

The other girls snickered. 

“Let her alone,” said the Mad- 
ame. “If she wants to bake a cake, 
why shouldn’t she?” 

No one answered. 

Miss Bestris went on around the 
room, discussing the girls’ clothing, 
brushing this girl’s hair, pinching 
that girl’s cheek, chucking this one 
under the chin, smiling, frowning. 
Then finally she stepped back and 
nodded. 

“You all look quite good, I 
think. I can be proud of you. And 
now, I want you all to go to your 
rooms and make them extra attrac- 
tive, and then try to get a little rest, 
so you’ll all be especially beautiful 
when the boys come. Run along 
now.” 

The girls filed out, and night 
continued to settle. After a while, 
her cigarette glowing in the gloom, 
the Madame waddled to her office. 
There three people were waiting 
for her. 



T HE OFFICE was plain, busi- 
nesslike, masculine; no lace, no 
ribbons, no perfume, only the crisp 



smell of new paper, the tangy odor 
of ink, the sweet smell of eraser 
fluid. When she came in the door 
the three people stood up. 

She waved her cigarette hand 
with a once delicate gesture and 
flame light glinted dully on the gold 
band. “Please don’t get up for me,” 
she said, but her tone was conde- 
scending and the three visitors sat 
down respectfully. 

Miss Bestris crossed to her desk; 
she perched on a comer of it, 
leaned back, blew smoke. 

“You wanted to see me about 
your girls?” 

Two of the people, man and 
wife, looked at each other. “Yes,” 
they said. And the other man said, 
“Yes.” 

“Did you bring any pictures?” 

They handed her pictures, and 
she held them up to the overhead 
torch. She studied them critically, 
pursing and unpursing her lips in 
secret calculation. 

“This one,” she said finally, 
holding out one of the pictures. 

The man and wife rustled their 
clothing; they smiled faintly proud 
at each other. 

The other man got up slowly, re- 
trieved his picture, left the room 
without saying a word. 

“We can’t do for little Lavada,” 
the woman whined. “She was a 
late child, and we’re getting old, 
and we thought she would be bet- 
ter here. It’s hard to do for a grow- 
ing girl when you get old. And my 
husband can’t keep steady work, 
because of his health and . .” 

“I’m sure she will be happy 
here,” the Madame said, smiling. 

“Yes,” the man agreed. “It’s for 
the best. But — you know — well, we 




SHE KNEW HE WAS COMING 



33 



hate to do it. 

“How old is she?’* 

. Fourteen.” 

Miss Bestris studied the picture 
again. “She doesn’t look over 
twelve.” 

“She’s fourteen.” 

“And healthy — ” 

“We have doctors to see to that,” 
the Madame said. “How much did 
you have in mind?” 

“Well,” the man said, “it’s been 
a month now since I worked, and 
with debts and everything. 

“And something to put aside for 
winter,” his wife added. 

“We couldn’t take less than a 
milli dor doc.” 

“And we wouldn’t even think of 
it, but we don’t have a scrap of 
bread in the house.” 

“And all our bills, and winter 
coming on. .” 

Miss Bestris turned the picture 
this way and that. The parents 
waited. The woman cleared her 
throat. The man shuffled his feet. 
The clock on the wall went tick- 
tick, tick-tick. 

“I’ll give you eight hundred and 
thirty dordocs” the Madame said. 

“Well. .” 

Miss Bestris bent forward, hold- 
ing out the picture. “Here, then. 
Take it. I wouldn’t offer that, but 
I need a girl right now. One of 
mine ran away last week, and I’m 
afraid she won’t be able to work 
for a month or so after they bring 
her back. I’m being generous. 
Eight hundred and thirty, or take 
your picture and don’t waste my 
time.” 

The man and woman stared at 
her. And the clock went tick-tick . 

“Take it. Chav.” 



. All right,” the man said. 
“We need the money.” 

Miss Bestris leaned across the 
desk, pressed a button on her pan- 
el. Almost immediately, a door slid 
silently open and her lawyer en- 
tered with a white, printed, stand- 
ard-form sales contract in his hand. 
Efficiently and rapidly, he entered 
the particulars. “Sign here,” he 
said, and the parents signed. 

“Now,” said the Madame, “if 
you’ll bring in Lavada tomorrow 
at nine, I’ll arrange for a doctor to 
be here. If his examination is satis- 
factory, the money will be ready.” 
The lawyer left, and the wom- 
an said, “You understand, we 
wouldn’t do this but for . .” 

“I understand, perfectly,” Miss 
Bestris said. “You don’t need to 
worry. This is the best kind of 
house — Earthmen only, you know, 
and they’re very particular. My 
girls are given the best of care. I’m 
like a mother to them, and if they 
are thrifty and diligent, they’ll be 
able to save enough money in a — 
a very short time to redeem their 
contract as provided by law. You 
needn’t worry at all.” 

“Well,” the woman said, “I feel 
better after talking to you. I feel 
better about the whole thing to 
hear you talk like that.” 

The clock went tick-tick . 

“Uh,” the man said, “you 
won’t — ? That is, our little daugh- 
ter is sometimes wilful and . uh 
. well . Sometimes.” 

Miss Bestris smiled. “We know 
how to handle girls.” 

“You’ll treat her . ?” 

“As I would my own child,” 
Miss Bestris said; she took out an- 
other cigarette, lit it. “I think we’ll 




34 



KRIS NEVILLE 



call her — well — Poppy. Earthmen 
like to feel at home, you know.” 
The clock went tick-tick . 

“Well, uh,” the man said. “Uh. 
Thank you.” 

I N ONE of the rooms upstairs 
Mary sat before the dressing 
table with her back to the mirror, 
while June and Adele occupied the 
two overstuffed chairs. Night 
sounds drifted up from the yellow 
canal, and fresh flower scents whis- 
pered on the warm air. The di- 
aphanous glass curtains rustled at 
the open window. 

“They’re too expensive,” Mary 
said. “I’m sure Miss Bestris over- 
charges us for them.” 

“Hush,” said June, glancing 
around at the walls nervously. 
“Hush, Mary.” She smoothed at 
the delicate, plutolac lace fringe 
above her breasts. “Imported ma- 
terial like this costs money. You 
can’t get it for nothing, and we 
have to have the best.” 

“I still think she charges too 
much.” 

Adele shrugged delicately and 
crossed shapely ankles. “I think 
Miss Bestris must like you, or she 
wouldn’t let you wear that dress 
again tonight. You ought to watch 
out that you don’t get on the wrong 
side of her.” 

Mary laughed, her amethyst eyes 
sparkling. “I won’t care. Not after 
tonight.” 

“You’re not going to run away?” 
June asked breathlessly. “You 
wouldn’t dare do that. You’d catch 
it, sure!” 

Mary shook her head. “Not run 
away.” 



Adele leaned forward and said 
huskily, “You got enough money 
to redeem your contract?” 

Again Mary shook her head. 
“No. It’s nine hundred and ten 
dordocs. I have only ninety-three. 
But I’ll have enough in the morn- 
ing!” She stood up and crossed to 
the window, looked out toward the 
spaceport. 

“How?” 

“Tell us, Mary!” 

“Tell you what?” Anne asked, 
coming into* the room. Languidly 
she drew the door closed behind 
her and rested against it. “Tell you 
what?” she insisted, narrowing 
milky eyes. 

“Mary says she can redeem her 
contract tomorrow.” 

Anne’s wide mouth curled con- 
temptuously. “Nonsense!” 

“It’s not,” said Mary without 
turning; 

Anne glided sensuously across 
the room to the bed, her tight fit- 
ting plastic rippling with her tiger- 
ish muscles. She sat down. 

“He said he’d take me away, this 
trip,” Mary continued. “He’ll sign 
off, and then we’ll both get a ship 
and go to one of the frontier plan- 
ets. Where it won’t matter about — 
all this.” 

Anne laughed harshly. “My 
God! You believe that?” 

“We’ve both been saving our 
money,” Mary said dreamily. “He’s 
in love with me. He said so.” 

“Honey, that’s what they all 
say.” 

Smiling, Mary turned from the 
window and leaned backward, 
stretching. “You don’t know him. 
He’s different.” 

“They’re all the same,” Anne 




SHE KNEW HE WAS COMING 



35 



said, her mouth twisting bitterly. 
“They’re just alike. Don’t believe 
any of them.” 

And Mary said, “With him, it’s 
different. You’ll see.” 

After a moment, Anne said, 
“That Earthman? That what’s-his- 
name?” Mary nodded, and Anne 
brushed an imaginary something 
off her knee. “An Earthman,” 
Anne said. “They’re the worst of 
all.” 

“You don’t know him, or you 
wouldn’t say that.” 

Adele looked away from Anne. 
“You love him, don’t you, Mary?” 
“Yes.” 

“You’re a fool,” Anne said. “Lis- 
ten to me. Love a man? God! 
You’ll see. After him, there’ll be 
another and another, and — just 
like Rosy — you’ll watch ’em leave 
you and laugh at you until finally 
you’re hurt so bad you don’t think 
you can stand being hurt any more, 
and then along comes another one, 
and it starts all over again, and 
then one night you take a razor 
blade and go to the sink and stick 
out your throat and . .” 

“No! No! You’re wrong! He’s 
not like the rest!” 

Anne leaned back carelessly, 
resting, propped on one hand. 
“See. You know I’m right, al- 
ready.” 

“You’re not!” 

Anne shrugged. “Honey, tell me 
that tomorrow night.” 

“I better go take my cake oqt,” 
Mary said. She fled the room in a 
swirl of shimmering glastic. 

Anne sneered, “I don’t see why 
Miss Bestris puts up with her the 
way she does.” 



“You’re jealous,” June said 
quietly. 

Anne did not answer. 

“Mary’s decent,” Adele said. 
“Maybe that’s why. She’s from the 
sticks, and her parents still come 
to see her on visiting days, and 
there’s something about her so — 
so innocent. Maybe that’s why Miss 
Bestris likes her.” 

June said, “I think she’s better 
than the rest of us. I think Miss 
Bestris feels sorry for her in a way.” 

“Don’t make me laugh,” Anne 
said, facing June. “The only one 
that’ll ever feel sorry for her is her- 
self!” 

“You shouldn’t have talked like 
that to her!” June snapped. “Why 
don’t you let her alone? She’ll feel 
bad enough without you helping!” 

Anne rolled over on the bed and 
stared up at the ceiling. June took 
a helox lamp from her drawer and 
started to bake her hair darker. 
Those Earthmen were so funny 
about colors. 

In the kitchen, Mary took die 
cake out of the oven. It was steamy 
and light and fluffy, and it smelled 
sweet and warm. She set it on the 
table and mixed a two-minute 
green frosting which she spread, 
carefully, over the cake. She patted 
here and there with the spatula 
and stood back, her eyes proud and 
serious. 

She hummed a little tune under 
her breath as she scrubbed the pots 
and pans. Her hands moved in 
practiced rhythm, and the water 
splashed and gurgled. When the 
kitchen was again spotless, she 
looked once more at the cake, and 
then, turning out the light, she 
went back to her room. 




36 



KRIS NEVILLE 



Anne and Adele had left, but 
June was sitting quietly in the 
dusky moonlight. Her white dress 
seemed vaguely luminous. 

Laughing, Mary flicked on the 
light. 

“It’s a wonderful cake,” she 
said. “The best one I ever made. 
Just the way it should be.” 

“I wouldn’t feel too bad, Mary, 
if he doesn’t come to eat it,” June 
said. “I don’t want to sound like 
Anne, but there was a lot of sense 
in what she said.” 

“It’s just like a real wedding 
cake.” She hummed the snatch of 
Martian tune. “Like in the tele- 
papers.” She laughed with her eyes. 
“The bridegroom takes the silver 
knife and cuts two large pieces of 
the cake while the bride, dressed in 
filament coral, stands at his right 
hand. She carries a bouquet of — 
Anne just likes to be mean!” 

June frowned. Mary crossed to 
the dressing table. She studied her 
face in the mirror. It was heart 
shaped, elfin; her purple hair was 
a riot of curls, and her eyes were 
amethyst and gold. She smiled at 
herself. “I want to look as pretty as 
I can tonight.” She twisted around. 
“You don’t think he’ll come either, 
do you?” 

“I— no, Mary.” 

Mary looked back at the mirror. 
“He likes our canal blossom per- 
fume.” She dabbed some of it on 
her ear lobes. “I like it best, too.” 
June stood up, crossed to the 
musikon, found a slow five-toned 
waltz. She turned the music very 
low, and left the color mixer dim 
enough so that only the faintest 
ghosts projected hues moved on 
walls and ceiling. 



Mary continued to stare into the 
mirror. “But he will come. I know 
it.” 

June said nothing. 

“Don’t you see. I just know he’ll 
come.” 

June crossed back to her seat. 

Mary turned from the mirror. 
“I’m sure he will. He’s— I 

mean. .” 

June smiled wanly. 

“Well, he will! You’ll see!” 

June said, “Even if it is an old 
dress, you look very nice in it.” 

“I’ve been learning his language. 
I can say ‘thank you’ and ‘yes’ and 
‘no’ and ‘I love you’ and all kinds 
of things in it. He gave me a book, 
and I’ve been studying. I want to 
be able really to talk with him. 
We’ve got a lot to talk about. I 
want to find out about his parents, 
and what he likes for supper and 
what kind of music he likes to hear, 
and — and all sorts of things. I want 
to find out all about his planet, 
and ...” 

“Yes,” June said wearily, “I 
know.” 

The music played on. The mov- 
ing lights on the walls were like 
colored reflections from a sunlit 
river. 

“He may be a little late tonight ; 
he has a lot to do, first. But he’ll be 
here.” 

Buzzzzz. 

It was the red button; it blinked 
on and off. 

“Visitors,” June said. 

“Look — ” Mary said. “Look, 
June. I’m not half ready yet. Look. 
Tell Miss Bestris I’ll be down a lit- 
tle late. Tell her I have a special 
boy, and it’ll be all right. He wants 
me to wait for him.” 




SHE KNEW HE WAS COMING 



37 



June was on her feet. All 
right. You’d better not wait too 
long!” 

“I won’t.” 

After June was gone, Mary re- 
turned to the task of making her 
face pretty, but after a moment, 
she turned from the mirror, leaned 
back, and tried to relax. Under- 
neath her dress, her heart was 
pounding. 

The warm air carried sounds of 
the night creatures. One of the 
great canal insects, screeching, 
flapped by the window. The tiny 
third moon crept up over the hori- 
zon, and the buildings cast triple 
shadows. 

Buzzz. Buzzzz . 

Still Mary waited. 

Buzzz . Buzzzz. Buzzzzzz . 

She was afraid to wait any 
longer. But by now she was sure 
that he would be down stairs. 

There was a last-minute flurry of 
combing and primping, and then 
she rustled out of the room, her 
head erect, her eyes shining. 

T HE LARGE reception room was 
filling. Overhead, the color or- 
gan threw shimmering, prismatic 
beams on the ceiling. Beneath it, 
stiff, embarrassed spacemen, mostly 
officers dressed in parade uniforms, 
chatted in space-pidgin with the 
laughing, rainbow-haired girls. 

Miss Bestris sat in one corner, 
her eyes roving the room: settling 
here for a second, there for a sec- 
ond, checking, approving, disap- 
proving, silently. Occasionally she 
would smile or nod at one of the 
girls or one of the spacemen, and 
once she frowned ever so slightly 



and shook her head. 

Anne was reclining on a couch, 
eating a golden Martian apple, lis- 
tening to a second mate; she 
played with a lock of his hair and 
smiled her wide smile. 

June, angelic, sat primly in a 
straight-backed chair, the captain 
at her feet, a boyish, space-pale 
Earthman, drew embarrassed cir- 
cles on the carpet with his index 
finger. 

In the next room, three couples 
were dancing to the slow music of 
an Earth orchestra. 

An inner door opened, and a 
uniformed native sheriff stepped in, 
a crisp, military figure. “Miss Bes- 
tris?” 

She stood up. “Yes?” 

The Earthmen fell silent, wait- 
ing. 

“We think we have your run- 
away.” He turned to the door. 
“Bring her in.” 

Two more sheriffs entered, and 
between them, there was a young, 
slender girl. Her face was gaunt 
and tear-stained. Her body trem- 
bled. She looked at the Madame 
fearfully. 

“You idiots!” Miss Bestris 
screamed. “Get her out of here! 
You’ll ruin my party! Take her 
out!” 

The two men removed the girl. 
To the remaining sheriff, Miss Bes- 
tris said, “Damn you, if you ever do 
anything like that again, I’ll . 
I’ll ...” 

“I’m sorry, Madame. But we 
wanted immediate identification. 
Would you want us to hold the 
wrong girl?” 

“That’s her, all right! Now, get 
out! Wait for me in my office.” 




38 



KRIS NEVILLE 



When they were gone Miss Bes- 
tris turned to the silent room. In 
quite passable Esperanto she said, 
“I — am sorry. A misunderstanding. 
I assure you, nothing. Go on with 
the party, and I’ll see what I can 
do for the poor girl.” 

She stood up and in her own 
language said, “Lively, girls! 
Smile! You, Rita, hurry and serve 
tea!” 

She made her exit. 

The spacemen grumbled among 
themselves, coughed uneasily, 
watched the closed door through 
which the Madame had gone. Lis- 
tening, they could hear only a 
muted mumble of sing-song sounds 
in several voices. 

With determined animation, the 
girls moved about, smiled, chatted. 

Rita came in, wheeling the tea 
tray, and the girls converged on it, 
each trying to be the first to serve 
her escort. The tea was the Mar- 
tian stuff, concocted of a kind of 
local hemp. The Earthmen found 
it harsh and bitter to the taste, but 
gentle on the soul. 

Anne had filled two cups and re- 
turned to the second mate when 
she caught sight of Mary coming 
down the stairs. 

On the lowest step, Mary stood 
for a long time; her eyes eagerly 
searched the crowd. Slowly a puz- 
zled, hurt look came over her face. 

June came to her side after a lit- 
tle while. 

“Isn’t he here?” 

“No. Not yet.” 

“I’m sorry,” June said, touching 
Mary’s arm lightly. 

“It’s all right. It’s early yet. I’ll 
just sit down by Miss Bestris* chair 
and wait for him.” 



She turned from June and went 
to the chair. Before she could sit 
down, a space corporal came over, 
bowed, tried to take her hand. She 
shook her head. He smiled twisted- 
ly and walked stiffly away. 

Another man smiled at her. She 
shook her head slowly. 

Someone came in the front door, 
and she leaned forward. Then she 
slumped back limply. 

She heard a tinkly laugh. She 
looked in its direction. She met 
Anne’s eyes, bright and amused. 
Just then Miss Bestris came in, her 
eyes angry and her cheeks flushed. 
She strode across the room. 

“Well,” she said. “I’m glad to 
see you finally came down.” She 
sank heavily into her chair. “(Pres- 
ent’s back. They just brought her 
in. The idiots came right in here 
with her. I’ll bet I lost half-a-dozen 
customers. These Earthmen are 
sensitive about such things.” 

Mary was still staring at the 
door; Miss Bestris looked down at 
her. 

“Well, what are you sitting here 
for?” 

“Please, Miss Bestris. I’m wait- 
ing for my special boy friend to- 
night.” 

She snorted and looked away. 
“Why isn’t he here?” 

“He will be.” 

“He’d better. I’ll let you wait an- 
other — half an hour. That’s all.” 

“Thank you, Miss Bestris. You’re 
very kind to me.” 

“I indulge you more than I 
ought to, child,” she said. “More 
than is good for you, if the truth 
were known.” 

A man came in; Mary stiffened 
and then relaxed. 




SHE KNEW HE WAS COMING 



39 



The mutter of voices blended 
into a steady hum. More couples 
were dancing. Miss Bestris moved 
around the room. The music was 
tinny. 

Another man came in. 

“Your time’s up,” the Madame 
told Mary. 

“Please, let me just wait for an- 
other few minutes.” 

Miss Bestris fixed her lips grim- 
ly. “I’ve had enough nonsense for 
tonight. You heard me!” 

“Please!” 

“You heard what I said.” 

“Miss Bestris, I couldn’t. Not to- 
night. Honest, I couldn’t. If I had 
to talk to anybody, I’d break down 
and cry. He’ll . come. I know he 
will.” 

Miss Bestris whirled on her. 
“Listen, you little — ” But she 
stopped, suddenly. “All right,” she 
said, gritting her teeth. “I can’t 
afford another scene tonight. But 
you’ll be sorry for this.” 

Miss Bestris stormily looked 
away. The dancers danced ; the 
music swelled louder. Gradually, 
deliberately, the lights were wan- 
ing. 

“Haven’t I always been good to 
you, Mary?” the Madame asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Then like an obedient girl, do 
as I say. If he hasn’t come by now, 
he just won’t. He’s gone to some 
other house.” 

“No!” Mary said doggedly. 

“Just remember, tomorrow, how 
you deliberately disobeyed me. 
Your silly emotions are costing me 
money, and that’s one thing I sim- 
ply won’t stand for.” 

“He’ll come.” Mary said. “You 
won’t lose money.” 



Couples sat side by side, laugh- 
ing, talking in whispers. Occasion- 
ally there were giggles. The room 
began to empty slowly. 

The lights continued to dim un- 
til the rooms were gloomy. Even 
the shifting shades of the color or- 
gan were no more than a faint 
lambence. Anne, laughing, helped 
her second mate to his feet. 

“I’ll give you one more chance,” 
Miss Bestris said. “The next man 
that comes in. .” 

“No! I just couldn’t! Not to- 
night!” 

A few more customers drifted in. 
Then even the stragglers stopped 
coming. It was very late. 

“He’s deserted you; you see that 
now?” Madame Bestris sneered. 

Mary stood up. There were tears 
in her eyes. “You can’t — you don’t 
— know — how I feel,” she choked. 
“You don’t care!” She turned and 
ran up the stairs, crying. 

Several Earthmen, still in the big 
room, turned to watch. The torches 
were misty twinkles now. The last 
couples climbed the stairs and then 
Miss Bestris, too, went to bed. 

T HE BLUE morning came. The 
town awoke; commerce began. 
At seven, Miss Bestris lay in bed 
frowning, considering the events of 
the previous evening. But she was 
not so annoyed that she forgot to 
call a doctor on the teleview and 
arrange for him to come at nine to 
give a physical examination. 

Her bulk out of bed, she dressed 
and went to the kitchen to brew a 
pot of hemp tea. The cleaning 
maid, moving about in the next 
room, heard Miss Bestris call

KRIS NEVILLE 



sharply: “Flavia! Come in here!” 
Flavia appeared with a dust rag 
in her hand. 

“Did you cut this cake?” 

“No, ma’am.” 

Miss Bestris glowered. “That lit- 
tle idiot! She must have slipped 
down here after we were all asleep 
and sat here and cried her silly lit- 
tle eyes out! If she thinks she can 
pull that love-sick act on me she’ll 
soon find out different. Am I sup- 
posed to put up with having her 
moon over every space tramp that 
comes in? Why, I’ve taken more 
from her — !” 

“Yes, ma’am.” 

Miss Bestris waddled to the 
stairs, climbed them determinedly. 
At Mary’s door she stopped and 
twisted the knob. Locked! 

Miss Bestris hammered. “Open 
up, Mary!” The door rattled un- 
der her hand. “Open that door at 
once!” 

No answer. 

Miss Bestris pounded harder. 
“Open up, I say!” 

Anne sauntered into the hall, her 
dressing gown swishing. “She really 
made you look the fool last night, 



didn’t she?” Anne said lazily. 

“You — you slut! Mind your own 
business.” 

Anne smiled and shrugged. 
“Open the door, Mary! Do you 
hear me! Open it!” 

“Maybe she killed herself,” Anne 
said. “It has happened.” 

“My God! No . She wouldn’t 
dare. You think she would?” 

Anne shrugged again. “They do 
funny things sometimes.” 

Miss Bestris’ face was red. “Run 
down and get my keys. In my desk. 
You know where they are.” 

Then, “For God’s sake , hurry!” 
While she waited Miss Bestris 
rattled the door, pleading and curs- 
ing.^ 

Finally Anne returned. Miss Bes- 
tris snatched the key with a shak- 
ing hand. She hurled the door 
open and burst inside. 

“See here, you little — !” She 
stopped. 

The room was empty. 

On the neatly made bed reposed 
a little stack of money. When Miss 
Bestris got around to counting it, 
she found that it contained exactly 
nine hundred and ten dordocs . 



v THE END 

IN THE NEXT ISSUE you’ll find as exciting a line-up of stories 
as you’ve ever seen in a science fiction magazine. For instance: 
there’s a humdinger of a novelette called BRINK OF MAD- 
NESS, by Walt Sheldon, a suspenseful cloak-and-dagger yam 
about the Central Investigation Bureau and the new World 
Government of the 22nd Century; there’s a short classic, by 
Tom Leahy, called ONE MARTIAN AFTERNOON that will 
curl your hair; also top-notch stories by Mark Clifton and 
Alex Apostolides, Edward W. Ludwig, H. B. Fyfe and others. 




There’s a song that says “ it’s later than you think” 
and it is perhaps lamentable that someone didn’t 
sing it for Henry that beautiful morning .

nPHE FARMER refused to work. 

His wife, a short thin woman 
with worried eyes, watched him 
while he sat before the kitchen 
table. He was thin, too, like his wife, 
but tall and tough-skinned. His 
face, with its leather look was im- 
mobile. 

“Why?” asked his wife. 

“Good reasons,” the farmer said. 

He poured yellow cream into a 
cup of coffee. He let the cup sit 
on the table. 

“Henry?” said the woman, as 
though she were really speaking to 
someone else. She walked around 
the kitchen in quick aimless bird 
steps. 

“My right,” said Henry. He lifted 
his cup, finally, tasting.

carefully. “Thing to do, is all. Each 
man in his own turn. This is my 
turn.” 

The woman watched him for a 
long time, then she sat down on a 
chair beside the table. The quick, 
nervous movement was gone out of 
her, and she sat like a frozen spar- 
row. 

The farmer looked up and grin- 
ned. “Feels good. Just to sit here. 
Does well for the back and the 
arms. Been working too hard.” 

“Henry,” the woman said. 

The farmer tasted his coffee 
again. He put the cup on the table 
and leaned back, tapping his 
browned fingers. “Just in time, I’d 
say. Waited any longer, it wouldn’t 
have done any good. Another few 
years, a farmer wouldn’t mean any- 
thing.” 

The woman watched him, her 
eyes frightened as though he might 
suddenly gnash his teeth or leap in 
the air. 

“Pretty soon,” the farmer said, 
“they’d have it all mechanical. 
Couldn’t stop anything. Now,” he 
said, smiling at his wife, “we can 
stop it all.” 

“Henry, go out to the fields,” the 
woman said. 

“No,” Henry said, standing, 
stretching his thin, hard body. “I 
won’t go out to the fields. Neither 
will August Brown nor Clyde 
Briggs nor Alfred Swanson. None 
of us. Anywhere. Not until the 
food’s been stopped long enough 
for people to wake up.” 

The farmer looked out of the 
kitchen window, beyond his tractor 
and the cow bam and the wind- 
mill. He looked at rows of strong 
com, shivering their soft silk in the 



morning breeze. “We’ll stop the 
corn. Stop the wheat. Stop the cat- 
tle, the hogs, the chickens.” 

“You can’t.” 

“1 can’t. But al! of us together 
can.” 

“No sense,” the woman said, 
wagging her head. “No sense. 

“It’s sense, all right. Best sense 
we’ve ever had. Can’t use an army 
with no stomach. Old as the earth. 
Can’t fight without food. Takes 
food to run a war. 

“You’ll starve the two of us, 
that’s all you’ll do. Nobody else will 
stop work.” 

The farmer turned to his wife. 
“Yes, they will. Everywhere a farm- 
er is the same. He works the land. 
He reads the papers. He votes. He 
listens to the radio. He watches the 
television. Mostly, he works the 
land. Alone, with his own thoughts 
and ideas. He isn’t any different in 
Maine than he is in Oregon. We’ve 
all stopped work. Now. This mom-

“How about those across the 
ocean? Are they stopping, too? 
They’re not going to feed up their 
soldiers? To kill us if we don’t 
starve first? To — ” 

“They stopped, too. A farmer is 
a farmer. Like a leaf on a tree. No 
matter on what tree in what coun- 
try on whose land. A leaf is a leaf. 
A farmer’s the same. A farmer is a 
farmer.” 

“It won’t work,” the woman said 
dully. 

“Yes, it will.” 

“They’ll make you work.” 
“How? It’s our own property.” 
“They’ll take it away from you.” 
“Who’ll work it then?” 

The woman rocked in her chair,

her mouth quivering. “They’ll get 
somebody.” 

The farmer shook his head. 
“Too many people doing other 
things, like making shells and guns, 
like sitting in fox-holes or flying 
planes.” 

The woman sat rocking, her 
hands together in her lap. “It won’t 
work,” she repeated. 

“It’ll work,” said the farmer. 
“Right now , it’ll work. Yes, we’ve 
got milkers and shuckers, and 
we’ve got hatchers for the chick- 
ens. We’ve got tractors and com- 
bines and thrashing machines. 
They’re all mechanical, all right. 
But we don’t have mechanical 
farmers, yet. The pumps, the trac- 
tors, the milkers don’t work by 
themselves. In time, maybe. Not 
now. We’re still ahead of them on 
that. It’ll work.” 

“Go out to the fields, Henry,” 
his wife said, her voice like the 
sound of a worn phonograph rec- 
ord. 

“No,” the farmer said, taking a 
pipe from his overalls. “I think in- 
stead, I’ll just sit in the sun and 
watch the corn. Watch the birds on 
top of the bam, maybe. I’ll fill my 
pipe and sit there and smoke and 
watch. And when I get sleepy, I’ll 
sleep. After while I might go see 
August Brown or Clyde Briggs or 
maybe Alfred Swanson. We’ll sit 
and talk, about pleasant things, 
peaceful things. We’ll wait.” 

The farmer put the pipe be- 
tween his teeth and walked to the 
door. He put on his straw hat, but- 
toned the sleeves of his blue shirt 
and stepped outside. 

His wife sat at the table, staring 
at nothing in the room. 



The farmer walked across the 
barnyard, listening to the sound of 
the chickens and the sound of the 
breeze going through the com. 
Near the bam, he sat upon an old 
tree stump and filled his pipe with 
tobacco. He lit the pipe, cupping 
his hands, and sat there, smoking, 
the smoke spiraling up into the 
bright warm air. 

He took his pipe from his teeth 
and looked at it. “Pipe of peace,” 
he said, laughing inside himself. 

The breeze was soft and the sun 
warm on his back. He sat there, 
smoking, feeling the quiet of the 
morning, the peace of the great sky 
above. 

He had no time to stand or to 
take his pipe from his mouth, when 
the two men crossed the yard and 
lifted him up by the arms. He 
dropped the pipe, while he was 
dragged past the house, to the road 
beyond. He had no time to yell or 
scream, before his hat was swept 
from his head, the overalls and the 
blue shirt stripped from his body. 

He had not even thought about 
what it was that had happened, be- 
fore he was thrust inside a white 
truck, with strong steel sides and 
with grilled windows like those of 
a cell. 

He was just sitting there, in the 
truck, without his clothes, speed- 
ing away with August Brown and 
Clyde Briggs and Alfred Swanson. 



^kUTSIDE, the sun was warm 
upon the earth. Chickens 
clucked in their pens, while birds 
fluttered about the top of the bam. 
A pig squealed. The corn rustled.

The Huddlers 

By William Campbell Gault 

Illustrated by Ernie Barth 



T HAT’S what we always called 
them, where I come from, hud- 
dlers. Damnedest thing to see from 
any distance, the way they huddle. 
They had one place, encrusting the 
shore line for miles on one of the 
land bodies they called the Eastern 
Seaboard. A coagulation in this 
crust contained eight million of the 
creatures, eight million . 

They called it New York, and it 
was bigger than most of the others, 
but typical. It wasn’t bad enough 
living side by side; the things built 
mounds and lived one above the 
other. Apartments they called them. 
What monstrosities they were. 

We couldn’t figure this huddling, 
at first. 

All our attention since Akers’ 
first penetration into space had 
been directed another way in the 
galaxy, and though I’ll grant you 
unified and universal concentration 
may be considered unwise in some 
areas, it’s been our greatest 



strength. It’s brought us rather 
rapidly to the front, I’m sure you’ll 
agree, and we’re not the oldest 
planet, by a damned sight. 

Well, by the time we got to the 
huddlers, Akers was dead and 
Murten was just an old man with 
vacant eyes. Jars was handling the 
Department, though you might say 
Deering ran it, being closer to most 
of the gang. Jars was always so 
cold ; nobody ever got to know him 
really well. 

They divided on the huddling. 
Fear, Jars said, and love, Deering 
said, but who could say for sure? 

As Deering said to me, “What 
could they fear? They’ve got ev- 
erything they need, everything but 
knowledge and their better speci- 
mens are getting closer to that, ev- 
ery day.” 

In the laboratory, Deering said 
this, and how did we know old Jars 
was in a corner, breaking down a 
spirigel? 




46 



WILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT 



“They fear each other,” Jars 
said, as though it was an official an- 
nouncement, as though any fact is 
permanent. “And they fear nature. 
It’s the most fear ridden colony of 
bipeds a sane mind could imagine.” 

Deering looked at me, and 
winked. 

Jars went back to the spirigel. 

Deering said, “Love, love, love. 
All they sing about, all they write 
about, all they talk about, love, 
love, love.” 

Jars was just tracing a z line on 
the spirigel and he put down his 
legort at that. “Rather superficial 
thinking, from a scientist,” he said 
quietly. “Surface manifestations to 
be considered as indicative. Oral 
and verbal camouflage to be accept- 
ed as valid. Deering, old thing, 
please — ” 

Deering shrugged. “So I am — 
what do they call it, a Pollyanna. 
Isn’t that a pretty word? So, I’m a 
Pollyanna.” 

“I rather think that describes 
you partially,” Jars said, “and with 
this particular planet we’re discuss- 
ing, it can be a dangerous atti- 
tude.” 

“So?” Deering said, nudging me. 
“And could I ask why?” 

“Ask it.” 

“I ask.” 

“You’ve recorded the state of 
their development. They have, 
among other things, achieved nu- 
clear fission.” 

“So? In the fourth grade we are 
teaching nuclear fission.” 

“We are a scientific people. They 
haven’t been, until very, very re- 
cently. You have noted, I hope, 
their first extensive use of this new 
discovery?” 



“Hero — Helo — ” Deering 
shrugged. “My memory.” 

“Hiroshima,” Jars supplied. 
“Love — , my friend?” 

“I have noted it,” Deering said. 
“We spoke, a while ago, of surface 
manifestations.” 

“We shall continue to. You have 
witnessed the mechanical excel- 
lence of their machines, in some 
ways beyond ours, because of their 
greater element wealth. You have 
noted the increased concentration 
of their better minds, their scien- 
tific minds. How long do you think 
it will be, friend, before they are 
ready for us?” 

“Ready, ready — ? In what way, 
ready?” 

“The only way they know, the 
only thing they seem to have time 
for — ready for war.” 

“War — ,” Deering said, and 
sighed. “Oh, Jars, they will be be- 
yond war, certainly, before they are 
cognizant of us. They are no tribe 
of incompetents; they grow each 
day.” 

“They — ?” Jars’ smile was cyni- 
cal. “Their scientists grow. Are 
their scientists in command, sir?” 

That “sir” had been unnecessary; 
Jars was the senior mind, here. 
Deering didn’t miss it, and he 
flushed. 

Jars said softly, “I apologize. It 
was not a thing to say. I have spent 
too much time in the study of these 
— monsters.” 

They had gone to school, togeth- 
er, those two, and the bond was 
there and the respect, but they 
were different, mentally, and each 
knew it. 

“You have a sharp tongue,” 
Deering said, “but a sharper mind. 




THE HUDDLERS

I believe I can stand it.” He smiled. 
“Love, fear, hate — what does it 
matter to us, except as phenom- 
ena?” 

“It matters to us, believe me, 
please. It concerns us very much, 
Am.” 

When Jars got to first names, he 
was emotionally wrought. I looked 
at him in surprise. And so did 
Deering. We weren’t ever going to 
warm up to him, but he was our 
best mind and there wasn’t a man 
in the department who didn’t ap- 
preciate that. 

We stared at him, and he sat 
down on the high bench near the 
Maling converters. He looked old 
and he was tired, we could see. 
“Evil,” he said quietly. “Fear, hate, 
evil — which of the three is the 
father and which are the sons? I 
suppose fear is the father.” 

“I’d always thought so,” Deering 
said, “though my education was al- 
most completely confined to the 
technical. I’m rather skimpy on the 
humanities.” 

“And I,” Jars said, and now 
looked at me. “But not you, Wer- 
ig ” 

“I don’t know them, sir,” I said. 
“Surface manifestations, as we’ve 
said before, today. It would need a 
closer study. Their huddling is 
what intrigues me the most.” 

One of the rare smiles came to 
Jars’ lined face as he looked at 
Deering. “Huddling, the lad says. 
If you don’t say it, I won’t, Arn.” 

Deering smiled in return. “We’ll 
change the routine, this time; you 
say ‘love’ and I’ll say ‘fear*. But 
seriously, Jars, you fear these — 
people?” 

“I fear them,” Jars said. “Scien- 



tifically, perhaps, they are tyros, 
but mechanically they are not. 
They have discovered forces and 
developed machines which they do 
not understand, and yet, have 
achieved efficiency with them. I 
fear any monster that powerful 
even though it is blind.” 

“And you think there is a possi- 
bility of their becoming — aware of 
us within any determinable time?” 
“I do. You will remember how 
quickly the Algreans developed, 
once they achieved unity? You 
will remember how quickly they 
became a threat?” 

“Yes,” Deering said quietly, 
“and I have been trying a long 
time to forget what we did to that 
planetoid.” 

“It was necessary for survival,” 
Jars said simply. “I think, by any 
standards, we would be the ones 
chosen to survive.” 

Deering’s smile was cynical. “At 
least, by our standards. We had a 
closer communication with them. 
About the huddlers, we know only 
what we convert from their strong- 
er video broadcasts. It is a device 
they seem to use more for enter- 
tainment than for information.” 
Jars nodded, and stood up. “And 
love is their major entertainment, 
perhaps. Love and war. But we 
gabble. I had a plan in mind, a 
plan to put before the assembly.” 

H E HAD a plan, all right, and I 
was part of it. The humanities 
had been no major with me, but 
they didn’t want a scholar, they 
wanted a reporter, anyway. Or per- 
haps I could be called a recorder. 
Jars talked and the assembly lis- 




48 



WILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT 



tened. They always do, when Jars 
talks. 

And I was their boy, and went 
into a concentrated and complete 
briefing. They put me under the 
lucidate and poured it to me, night 
and day, all the information we 
had on the huddlers and all the 
theories based on that information. 

They put me into a space sphere, 
and said “good luck” and do our 
people proud, young man. Oh, yes. 
And don’t fall in love. Oh, no. 
They’d pick me up, again, when 
they got a signal. They didn’t ex- 
pect to wait too long for that, I 
guess, at the time. 

The sphere was a relic of the Al- 
grean business, and Algrea hadn’t 
been this much of a trip. But Me- 
chanics said it would do, and it 
did. 

I landed in the Pacific, about 
three-quarters of a mile off the 
Santa Monica yacht basin, and let 
the sphere float north for a while 
until I reached a secluded spot. In 
a small curve of the shore line, a 
few miles above Santa Monica, I 
beached her, and opened the dis- 
solving cocks. 

I watched her melt into the surg- 
ing water, and turned to face the 
red and green light almost immedi- 
ately overhead. I walked up from 
the beach to the road, not even 
knowing what they looked like. 
Their evolution should have 
matched ours, but who could be 
sure? 

For all I knew, I might be a 
freak to them. I should have 
thought of that before dissolving 
the ship. 

Above, the light changed from 
red to green and across the street, I 



saw a sign. This was Sunset Boule- 
vard, and the Pacific Coast High- 
way. This was open country, but 
Los Angeles. 

Along the Coast Highway, a pair 
of lights were bearing down on me, 
and they seemed to waver, as 
though the machine were under 
imperfect control. 

I moved back, out of the way, 
and the light overhead turned to 
red. The car stopped about even 
with me, its motor running. 

I couldn’t see the occupants nor 
the driver. The light changed, the 
car jerked, and the motor stopped. 

“Damn,” somebody said. It was 
a female voice. 

There was a grinding noise, and 
another damn, and then a head 
appeared through the open win- 
dow on my side of the road. 

It was a blond head, and what 
I could see of the face looked at- 
tractive. 

“Are you sober?” she asked. 

“Not always,” I answered. 
“Some times I’m quite cheerful. 
But I’m some distance from home, 
and have nothing to be cheerful 
about, at the moment.” 

“Try not to be a Cerf,” she said 
angrily. “What I mean is, are you 
— have you been drinking?” 

“Not recently, though I could 
use some water.” I could see her 
face more clearly now, and it was 
like the faces of our women, only 
prettier than most, I thought. 

“Look,” she said, “Pm drunk. 
Could you drive this thing? Could 
you drive me home?” 

“I’d be glad to,” I answered, “if 
you will tell me where you live.” 

She gave me an address on Sun- 
set, and this was Sunset, this lateral

street, ending at the ocean. So, 
quite obviously, it was an address I 
could find. 

I went over to climb in behind 
the wheel. There were two smells 
in that pretty car with the canvas 
top. One smell was of gasoline, the 
other was of alcohol. 

“There’s obviously alcohol in the 
gasoline,” I said, “though that 
shouldn’t prevent it from igniting.” 
“A funny, funny man,” she said. 
“Keep the dialogue to a minimum, 
will you, Bogart? Fm not exactly 
sharp, right now.” 

I depressed the starter button, 
and the motor caught. I swung left 
onto Sunset, and started up the hill. 

The car was clearly a recent 
model, but Jars had been wrong 
about the mechanical excellence of 
these huddlers. The machine sim- 
ply had no life, no zest. 



W E DROVE past a shrine and 
around two curves, climbing all 
the while, past some huddled 
houses on the left, and the whole 
shining sea spread out on the right. 

The woman said, “If you know 
a place where the coffee is drink- 
able, stop.” 

“I have no money,” I said. Dia- 
monds I had, a bagful of them, 
for AVe knew that huddlers treas- 
ured diamonds. But no money. 

“I’ve got money,” she said. “I’ve 
got a hell of a lot more money than 
I have sense. Have you ever been 
in love, Bogart?” 

“Never,” I said. 

We were coming into a small 
huddled area, now. A sign read. 
Pacific Palisades . 

“I have,” she said. “I still am. 



Isn’t it a miserable rotten world?” 
“This one?” I asked, and then 
said quickly, “I mean — this part of 
it?” 

“Any part of it,” she said. “I’ve 
seen most of it, and any part where 
there’s men is bad, Bogart.” 

“My name,” I told her, “is not 
Bogart. My name is Fred Werig.” 
“A pleasure, Fred,” she said. 
“My name is Jean Decker. And 
I’m beginning to feel better.” 

“It couldn’t be my company,” I 
said, “so it must be the air. I 
haven’t seen any coffee places that 
are open.” 

I caught a flare of light from the 
comer of my eye, and turned to see 
her applying flame to something in 
her mouth. I remembered from our 
history; she was smoking. It was a 
habit long dead where I came 
from. 

And then I remembered what 
she’d said about being drunk, and 
knew that, too, as one of our long 
disused vices. What was it Akers 
had said about ‘being directed’? A 
theory, but discredited now, since 
our scientific advance. But this al- 
most parallels evolution? 

“Cigarette?” she said, and I said, 
“No, thanks. I — don’t smoke.” 
“You’re the only thing in Los 
Angeles that doesn’t,” she said bit- 
terly. “Where are you from, Fred?” 
“New York,” I said. “Where are 
you from, Jean?” 

“Believe it or not, I was bom 
here,” she said. “Fm one of the 
three people in this town who was 
Bom here.” 

“It’s a big town, isn’t it?” I said. 
“Less huddled than the others.” 
“Huddled,” she said, and 
laughed. “Huddled. I like that.

They huddle, all right, and not just 
the football teams. The gregarious 
instinct, Freddy boy.” 

“Well, yes,” I agreed, “but why, 
Jean? Why haven’t they outgrown 
it? Is it — fear?” 

“You would have to ask some- 
body bright,” she said. “When you 
get to Bundy, turn over toward 
Wilshire. We’ll find an eating place 
that’s open.” 

“You tell me when I get to 
Bundy,” I said. “I’m not exactly 
familiar with this part of town.” 

She told me, and we got to Wil- 
shire, eventually, and on Wilshire 
there were many eating places. 

We went into one; it was too 
cold to eat outside. And it was 
bright in there, and I got my first 
really clear look at the face and 
figure of Jean Decker. 

Well, it was ridiculous, the at- 
traction that seemed to emanate 
from her. It actually made me 
weak. 

And she was staring at me, too. 



backed benches, and she sat down. 
I sat across from her. 

“I don’t have a tailor,” I said. 
“Your lips are so red, Jean.” 

She frowned. “Slowly, sailor.” 
Then a waitress was there, and I 
saw how red her lips were, too, and 
I realized it was another of the old 
vices I’d forgotten, cosmetics. 

“Just coffee, for me, black,” Jean 
said. “Golden boy over there will 
have a beef barbecue, probably, 
won’t you, Fred?” 

“I guess,” I said. “And some 
milk, cow’s milk.” 

Jean laughed. “It’s my money. 
Have canary milk.” 

“Not tonight,” I said. 

The waitress went away, and 
there was a noticeable period of si- 
lence. Jean was tracing some de- 
sign on the table top with her in- 
dex finger. Her nails, too, were 
painted, I saw. I liked the effect 
of that. 

She looked up, and faced me 
gravely, “Fred, you’re a very at- 



“If you’re hungry,” 
she said finally, “get a 
sandwich. You won’t find 
me stingy. What in the 
world is that material in 
that suit, Fred?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. 
“You are beautiful, 
Jean.” 

She smiled. “Well, 
thanks. You can have a 
piece of pie, too, for that. 
That certainly is a fine 
weave in that material. 
What did your tailor call 
it?” 

We were next to a sort 
of alcove, furnished with 
a table and two high-

tractive gent, which you undoubt- 
edly know. Are you connected with 
pictures?” 

I shook my head. “Just a travel- 
er, a tourist.” 

She said, “Oh” and went back to 
tracing the design. I thought her 
finger trembled. 

A very dim smile on her face, 
and she didn’t look away from the 
table top. “You’ve been — picked 
up before, undoubtedly.” 

“No. What kind of talk is this, 
Jean?” 

Now, she looked up. “Crazy talk. 
You’re no New Yorker, Freddy lad. 
You’re a Middle Westerner; you 
can’t fool me. Fresh from the farm 
and craving cow’s milk.” 

“I never saw a cow in my life,” I 
told her truthfully, “though I’ve 
heard about them. What makes 
you think I’m from a farm?” 

“Your freshness, your complex- 
ion and — everything about you.” 

The waitress brought our food, 
then, and I didn’t answer. I tried 
to keep my eyes away from Jean as 
I ate; I had a mission, here, and 
no time for attachments beyond the 
casual. I was sure, even then, that 
loving Jean Decker would never 
qualify as casual. 

She drank her coffee and 
smoked; I ate. 

She asked, “Where are you stay- 
ing, in town, Fred? I’m sober 
enough to drive, now.” 

“I’ll get public transportation,” 
I said. “You get home, and to 
bed.” 

She laughed. “Public transpor- 
tation? Freddy, you don’t know 
this town. There isn’t any. Did you 
just get here, tonight?” 

I looked at her, and nodded. 



“On the bum?” she said quietly. 

“I — suppose,” I said honestly, 
“though the word has connotations 
which don’t describe me.” I put 
my hand in my jacket pocket and 
fumbled in the open bag for one of 
the smaller diamonds. I brought 
one out about the size of my little 
finger nail, and placed it on the 
table. 

All the light in the room seemed 
to be suddenly imprisoned there. 
She stared at it, and up at me. 

“Fred — for heaven’s sake — that’s 
not — real, is it?” 

I nodded. 

“But — it — ” She glanced from 
the diamond to me, her mouth par- 
tially open. “Fred, what kind of 
monstrous gag is this? God, I 
thought I’d seen everything, grow- 
ing up in this town. Fred — ” 

“I’d like to sell it,” I said. “You, 
Jean, are my only friend in this 
town. Could you help me arrange 
for its sale?” 

She was looking at me with won- 
der now, studying me. “Hot?” she 
asked. 

“Hot—?” 

“Stolen — you know what I 
mean.” 

“Stolen? Jean, you didn’t mean 
to accuse me of that.” 

Skepticism was ugly on her lovely 
face. “Fred, what’s your angle? 
You step out of the darkness like 
some man from Mars in a strange 
suit, with no money, but a diamond 
that must be worth — ” 

“We’ll learn what it’s worth,” I 
said. “Mars isn’t inhabited, Jean. 
Don’t you trust me? Have I done 
anything to cause you to distrust 
me?” 

“Nothing,” she said. 




52 



WILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT 



“Do you distrust all men, Jean?” 
“No. Just the ones I’ve met. Oh, 
baby, and I thought you were a 
farmer.” She was crushing out her 
cigarette. “You haven’t a place to 
stay, but I’ve got a guest house, 
and you’ll stay there, tonight. You 
aren’t stepping back into the dark- 
ness, tonight, Fred Werig. You, I 
want to know about.” 

The words held a threat, but not 
her meaning, I was sure. And what 
better way to orient myself than in 
the home of a friend? 



T HAT was some home she had. 

Massive, in an architecture I’d 
assumed was confined to the south- 
eastern United States. Two-story 
place, with huge, two-story pillars 
and a house-wide front porch, the 
great lawn studded with giant trees. 

And she lived there alone, ex- 
cepting for the servants. She was 
no huddler, and I told her that. 

“Dad owned a lot of property in 
this town,” she said. “He was a 
great believer in the future of this 
town.” 

At the time I didn’t understand 
what that had to do with her lack 
of huddling. 

The guest house was small, but 
very comfortable, a place of three 
bedrooms and two baths and a 
square living room with a natural 
stone fireplace. 

I had my first night of sleep on 
this planet, and slept very well. I 
woke to a cloudy morning, and the 
sound of someone knocking on the 
front door. 

It was a servant, and she said, 
“Miss Decker sent me to inform 
you that breakfast will be ready 



any time you want it, sir. We are 
eating inside, this morning, because 
of the cold.” 

“I’ll be there, soon, thank you,” 
I said, and she went away. 

Showering, I was thinking of 
Akers for some reason and his di- 
rected theory and what was that 
other theory he’d had? Oh, yes, the 
twin planets. Senile, he was, by 
that time and not much listened to, 
but a mind like that? And who had 
he been associated with at that 
time? It was before my birth, but 
I’d read about it, long ago. The 
Visitor, Akers had called this man. 
The Earth man who had come to 
Venus. And what had his name 
been? 

Beer — ? Beers — ? No, but like 
that — and it came. 

Ambrose Bierce. 

Jean wore a light green robe, for 
breakfast, and it was difficult for 
me to take my eyes away from her. 

“I’m not usually this informal at 
mixed breakfasts,” she told me, 
smiling, “but I thought it might 
warm up enough for a swim a lit- 
tle later.” 

She threw the robe aside, and I 
saw she was wearing a scanty gar- 
ment beneath it. Evidently the 
huddlers didn’t swim naked, and I 
wondered at a moral code that 
sanctioned drinking alcohol but 
was ashamed of the human body. 

I was glad the house had been 
cold when I answered the maid’s 
summons, for I had worn a robe 
I’d found there. 

Fruit juice and wheat cakes and 
sausage and toast and jelly and 
eggs and milk. We ate in a small 
room, off a larger dining room, a 
small room whose walls were glass

on two sides. 

“It’s too old a house to modern- 
ize completely,” Jean told me. “I 
grew up in this house.” 

“You don’t — work, Jean?” 

“No. Should I?” 

“Work or study. Life must be 
very dull if you don’t do one of 
those.” 

“You might have a point there,” 
she said. “I tried everything from 
the movies to sculpture. I wasn’t 
very good at anything. What do 
you do, Fred?” 

“I’m a perpetual guest,” I said 
lightly. “Do you read much, Jean?” 
“Too much, though nothing very 
heavy, I grant you.” 

“Have you ever read about a 
man named Ambrose Bierce?” 
“I’ve read everything he ever 
wrote. Why did you ask that, 
Fred?” 

“I — heard about him. I won- 
dered who he was.” 

“Where did you hear about him, 
Fred? In Mexico?” 

“No. I don’t remember where I 
heard about him.” 

“He disappeared,” she said 
quietly, “some time right before the 
first world war. I’ve forgotten the 
exact year. I think it was 1914.” 
Before the war, before the “first” 
war . And I thought of Jars’ 
wife, who had come to us just be- 
fore this last planetary war — the 
“second” world war. And what was 
his pet name for her? Guest, he 
called her, and joked about her 
coming from another world. But 
didn’t Jars defend the discredited 
late-in-life theories of Akers? I 
tried to remember the name of 
Jars’ wife, and then it came. 

I asked, “And Amelia Earhart?” 



Jean’s voice was rough. “July 
2nd, 1937. I guess I’ll never forget 
that, when my god died. What are 
you trying to say? Is it some new 
damned cult you’re promoting, 
Fred?” 

“You called her a god. Why, 
Jean?” 

“I don’t know. I was only thir- 
teen when she died. But she was so 
clean, so — so free and windswept, 
so — oh, what the spirit of America 
should be — and isn’t.” 

I looked up to see tears in her 
eyes. Why was she moved? This 
girl who certainly knew corruption, 
this worldly, lovely girl. I smiled at 
her. 

She wiped the tears with the 
back of her hand. “Fred, you are 
the strangest — I know this town’s a 
zoo, but you, Fred — ” 

I continued to smile at her. “I’m 
just a guy trying to learn. May I 
repeat something I said last night? 
You’re beautiful, Jean.” 

“You’re no three-headed calf, 
yourself,” she said. 

Twin planets and parallel evo- 
lution . Parallel destiny? Not 
with a third planetary war shaping 
up here. Three major wars in less 
than fifty years. Why, why, why . 

She said, “Thinking, again? You 
do a lot of thinking, don’t you?” 

“I have to think of something 
besides you,” I told her honestly. 
“I can’t afford to fall in love with 
you, Jean. I’ve too many places to 
go and too many things to see.” 
She just stared at me. It must 
have been a full minute before she 
said, “Well, I’ll be damned.” 

After breakfast, it was still cold, 
and she said, “There’ll be no swim 
this morning, I see. If you want to 




54 



WILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT 



get an appraisal on that diamond, 
Fred, I’ll phone one of our jewelers 
to come out.” 

“I’d appreciate that,” I said. 
“Would it be all right if I took 
these newspapers back to my room, 
now?” 

“Just dandy,” she said. “Sorry to 
be boring you.” 

“You’re not,” I told her earnest- 
ly. “Believe me, you’re not.” 

T HE PAPERS were interesting. 

Nowhere was it stated, but a 
glance at the front pages showed 
they were on opposite sides of the 
political fence. On my planet, we 
keep the editorial opinion in the 
editorial columns. Not so with 
these. The wire services were im- 
partial and the accounts in both pa- 
pers identical. That was as far as the 
similarities went. Reading the other 
accounts was like living in two 
worlds. 

An informed people will always 
be free. Well, perhaps these weren’t 
typical. 

I was to see papers a lot worse 
than these before long. 

I was just starting the want ads 
when the knock came at the door. 
It was the maid, again; the jeweler 
was at the house. 

A small man, suave and dark, 
with the manners of a diplomat, 
fawning like a puppy. 

It was a perfect stone, he de- 
cided. He had, he was sure, a cus- 
tomer who would be interested. 
Would I accept eight thousand 
dollars for it? 

I said I would, and he left. 

We were in the living room, and 
Jean stood near the tall front win- 



dows. She had changed to a suit of 
some soft blue material. 

“As soon as I get the money,” I 
said, “we’re going out for some fun, 
aren’t we? I owe you for a beef 
barbecue.” 

“You don’t owe me anything,” 
she said. She didn’t look at me. 

“You’ll get over him,” I said. 

“Him — ?” He turned to look at 
me curiously. 

“That man you’re in love with, 
that man you told me about last 
night.” 

“Oh,” she said. “Oh. I was 
drunk last night, Fred. I’m not in 
love.” 

Silence. That attraction of hers 
pulling at me like some localized 
gravity, silence, and the beating of 
my heart. Silence, my hands trem- 
bling, my knees aching. 

“I’d like to see some fights,” I 
said. “Would you like to?” 

She frowned. “Not particularly.” 
She stared at me, shook her head, 
and looked away. 

“Well,” I said, “I haven’t fin- 
ished the want ads.” 

“Of course,” she said. “Get right 
back to them, Freddy. You never 
know when you’ll find a bargain.” 

They weren’t very interesting. I 
kept seeing her standing next to 
the window, looking unhappy, frus- 
trated, somehow. I kept seeing the 
soft fabric of the suit clinging to 
her beautiful body and the proud 
grace of her posture. 

I went back to the house, and 
she was sitting on the davenport 
near the fireplace. She looked up 
without expression. 

I asked, “Is there a library 
around here?” 

She sighed, and rose. She said, 




THE HUDDLERS 



55 



“Follow me.” 

She led me to a room whose four 
walls were lined with books. There 
was a wide glass door leading out 
from this to the patio. 

“Dad’s old retreat,” she said. 
“Everything from Aristotle to Zola. 
If there’s something you don’t see, 
don’t hesitate to ask. We aim to 
please.” 

She closed the door behind her. 

I didn’t gorge; I only nibbled. 
But fed enough to realize this was 
a deep, rich culture; this planet 
had produced some first rate minds 
and exceptional talents. But still, 
with all this to choose from, the 
people seemed to prefer Milton 
Berle. And the people were in com- 
mand. 

I was reading Ambrose Bierce 
when she came in. She looked at 
the book, and at me. “Lunch,” she 
said quietly. 

I put the book down, and rose. 
“The unwelcome guest?” 

“I’d tell you, if you were.” 

“Would you, honestly?” 

She didn’t answer that. She 
smiled, and said, “There are some 
fights at Ocean Park, tonight.” 

We saw those, and later, some 
amateur fights. Strange spectacles 
they were, men belaboring each 
other, but fascinating, too. The 
amateurs were less talented, but 
more friendly, leaving the ring arm 
in arm, if both were still conscious. 
The professionals displayed no 
such amicability. 

Why? I asked Jean. What was 
the difference between the ama- 
teurs and the professionals? 

“Money,” she said, and looked 
at me strangely. “Didn’t you really 
know that?” 



I lied with a nod. “I wanted you 
to see it, and to word it for your- 
self.” 

“Look,” she said with controlled 
irritation, “if I want any curbstone 
philosophy, I can read one of those 
corny columnists. I certainly don’t 
have to sit in a screaming mob 
watching a couple of morons 
pound each other bloody to arrive 
at a stupid generality like that.” 
“Let’s get a hamburger,” I said. 
She just stood there, on the 
sidewalk. “You — you — ” 

People were turning to stare. 
“Farmer?” I suggested. 

“Oh,” she said, “oh, oh — ” 

“Or a cheeseburger,” I added. 
There was a small crowd, now, 
openly watching. One man said, 
“Hey, this is better than them jerks 
inside. Slug him, lady.” 

Jean started to laugh, and so did 
I, and then all of us were laughing, 
the whole crowd. 

We didn’t go to a hamburger 
place. We went to a place where 
we could dance, too, and I had a 
small glass of wine, and wondered 
why we’d outgrown alcohol, on our 
planet. 

It was a night I will never for- 
get. It was a night I learned how 
much she meant to me. There 
wasn’t ever going to be anybody 
else for me, after that night. 

W E WERE married in Las Trenos 
at five-thirty the next morn- 

ing. 

And still, I didn’t tell her where 
I was from. When the time came, 
she could go back with me, but I 
couldn’t risk sharing that secret 
with her. I didn’t have the right to 




56 

jeopardize my people by giving her 
information she might divulge un- 
intentionally. 

The world was our playground, 
and my study hall American first. 
We drove east, taking our time, 
while I tried to get the temper of 
the people. I never overlooked a 
chance to talk to people ; the papers 
were no subsitute for that. And be- 
tween the papers and the people, 
I found that only the hysterics were 
voluble, only the biased articulate. 
And yet, it was a country with a 
liberal and progressive tradition, a 
country that should have been in- 
formed beyond the average. 

Knowledge had been made too 
easy; the glib were in command. 

Fear, Jars had said, and it was 
becoming increasingly clear to me 
that he was closer to it than Deer- 
ing. For Deering’s viewpoint, I had 
a working model, I had Jean. 

In the canyon city, New York, 
high in our room at the Empire- 
Hudson, she said, “You’re an aw- 
fully nosy guy, Dream Boat.” 

“I like to talk to people,” I said. 
“Haven’t you been getting enough 
attention?” 

“As much as I can handle,” she 
said. “And I’m enjoying every sec- 
ond of it. But it seems to be get- 
ting you down.” 

“You or the people?” I asked, 
and mussed her hair. 

She didn’t answer that. “Fred,” 
she said, “do you remember that 
day at breakfast, long ago? Do you 
remember asking about Ambrose 
Bierce and Amelia Earhart?” 

“I guess I do.” 

“Don’t be evasive, Fred. You 
know you do.” 

I pulled her close. “Is this going 



WILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT 

to be a questioning period? Is this 
one of those marriages?” 

“Now, Fred — ” she said, against 
my shoulder. “Be serious, please, 
Fred. Please be serious — oh, you, 
Fred—” 



W E WENT to England. What’s 
that phrase they have — “mud- 
dling through”? That’s what they 
were doing. Proudly, with a mini- 
mum of complaint, with no thought 
of rebellion, with no rationalizing 
or projection, living as the sub- 
merged tenth lives in America, and 
seeming to think that — well, things 
could be worse. 

In Italy, it was the kids, the beg- 
gars and procurers and thieves and 
even murderers who were kids. In 
Spain we found much of the same. 
In France it was all the heat and 
no light, charges and counter- 
charges, lies and counter-lies, con- 
fusion and corruption. 

In Berlin, it was Russia. The 
cloud that darkens the world looms 
darkest in Berlin. The apathy that 
grips the world is epitomized in 
Berlin. A people with no sense of 
guilt and no reason for hope, nor 
stirring to the promise of a re-armed 
Germany. A bled and devastated 
people, shorn of their chief 
strength, their national pride. 

Jean said, “I’ve seen enough. 
Haven’t you, Fred? How much can 
you take?” 

“One more,” I said. “Russia.” 
“Don’t be silly,” she said. “How 
would we get into Russia?” 

“We wouldn’t. But 1 would.” 
“Look, baby, whither though go- 
est, I—” 

“Up to here,” I said. “Who’s the 




THE HUDDLERS 



57 



big boss in this family?” 

“Now, Fred — ” 

“Now, Jean — ” 

“Get away from me. This time, 
it won’t work. If you think that for 
one second you’re going into that 
no man’s land alone — and — ” 

It took some talking, to convince 
her, it took some lies. She’d wait, 
she agreed finally, in Switzerland. 
In comfort for a change. 

It took two diamonds to get to 
the right man, and it took a form- 
ula from there. A formula that is 
learned in the first year of college 
chemistry on my planet, a formula 
for converting an element. A form- 
ula this planet couldn’t have been 
more than a decade short of learn- 
ing, anyway. 

The last man I saw in Berlin 
went along, for which I was grate- 
ful, though he didn’t know that. 
I don’t speak Russian, but he did. 

They were careful, they don’t 
even trust themselves. I told Nile- 
noff the formula came from Ameri- 
ca, and there were more, but I 
needed money. I didn’t tell him the 
fallacy in the formula ; it had taken 
us three years to realize what it was. 

My trips were limited, directed, 
and avoided the seamier side. I saw 
the modern humming factories, and 
the mammoth farms. No unemploy- 
ment, no waste, no “capitalistic 
blood sucking” — and the lowest 
standard of living in the industri- 
alized world. A vast, bleak land 
peopled with stringless puppets, 
with walking cadavers. 

I remembered the faces of the 
crowds and the strangely mixed 
people in America, their obvious 
feelings, emotions and rivalries. 
There was nothing strange about 



these people of Russia — they were 
dead, spiritually dead. 

The country that could have been 
a cultural and industrial center of 
the world was a robot-land of nine 
million square miles, getting ready 
for war, getting ready to take over 
the dreams of Hitler and make 
them come true. 

I came out with a promise of ten 
thousand American dollars for 
every one of the future formulas I 
had assured them I could get to. I 
came out with the knowledge that 
I’d be a watched man from now on. 

In Switzerland, Jean said, 
“Well—?” 

“I’m ready to go home,” I told 
her. 

“America, you mean?” 

“Where else?” 

“I’ve been alone,” she said, “and 
thinking. I’ve gone back to Sunset 
and Pacific Coast Highway and 
traced it all forward from there. 
And I don’t think America’s your 
home.” 

Very cool her voice, very tense 
her face. I smiled at her. 

She didn’t smile in return. “Fred 
— we’re married.” 

“I’m glad,” I said. “Aren’t you?” 

“It’s no time for the light touch.” 
Tears in her eyes. “Fred, are you 
a — a Russian spy?” 

I shook my head. 

“But — ” 

It was a clear night, and I went 
to the window. How it shone, in 
that clear air. Jean came over to 
stand next to me. 

I pointed, and said, “There’s my 
home.” 

“Venus,” she said. “Fred, for 
heaven’s sake — Vm serious !” 

“Some day,” I said, “this planet 




58 



WILLIAM CAMPBELL GAULT 



will learn how to see through our 
manufactured fog. Some day they 
will develop the vision we devel- 
oped a century ago. And — ” 
“Damn it, Fred, be serious. If 
you’d know what I’ve gone through, 
alone here, thinking back on all 
the crazy things you’ve said and 
done. What have you told me about 
yourself, what do I know?” 

“Nothing,” I said. “And what 
have I asked you about yourself? 
It’s a matter of faith, Jean.” 
“Faith? Running all over the 
country like fugitives, financed by 
those damned diamonds, nosing in- 
to this and into that, and then run- 
ning off to Russia, all alone. With 
what you’d learned , Fred?” 

I shook my head, resentment 
stirring in me. 

“Remember when we met? In 
Santa Monica — right there, next to 
the beach. You didn’t have a thing 
but the clothes on your back and a 
bagful of diamonds. Was it a sub 
that brought you that far, Fred?” 
“No,” I said, “and you wouldn’t 
believe me if I told you.” 

“Try me, and see,” she said. She 
was rigid, and near hysteria. 

“All right. I came there in a 
space sphere from Venus.” 

She started to sob, a wild, lonely 
sound and I moved forward to take 
her in my arms. 

Her fingers clawed my face, her 
high heel smashed my instep. “Get 
out,” she screamed, “get out, get 
out, get out — ” 

I got out. I went to the first floor 
washroom and cleaned up my 
bloody face, and then went into 
the bar. This was one habit I’d 
picked up on the planet. 

When I came up to the suite, 



later, I didn’t even check to see if 
she was in the washroom. I flopped 
down on the davenport and didn’t 
know anything for the next twelve 
hours. 

She was gone, when I came to. 
She’d checked out before I’d come 
back to the room, the night before. 

I missed the plane she took from 
France. I missed her by a day in 
New York. I went back to the big 
house with the high pillars on Sun- 
set Boulevard. 

And she wasn’t there. 

She’d come back to it, I knew. 
I moved in, to wait. I wasn’t going 
home without her; I wasn’t even 
sure I was going home with her. I 
was involved, now, in this planet, 
almost as crazy as the rest of them. 

I sat. I did some drinking, but 
mostly I sat, going back over all 
our days, reading nothing, enjoying 
nothing, just remembering. 

The Korean business started and 
the headlines grew uglier, and the 
jackals screamed and the people 
grew more confused. 

One day, the maid told me I 
had a visitor. I was in the library 
and I told her to send him back. 

When he came in, he closed the 
door behind him. I’d never seen 
him, before, but he said, “We’ve 
been looking for three weeks.” 

“We?” 

“Thirty of us,” he said. “What 
happened? Jars sent me.” 

“Oh,” I said. “I can’t come, now. 
I’m — married — ” 

He smiled. “If you knew what a 
mess it’s been. We’ve got men all 
over the planet. Does your wife — 
know?” 

“She thinks I’m crazy,” I said. 
“Look, I—”

“I’m not to argue,” he said. 
“Just make your report, and I’ll 
pick it up, tonight.” 

Five minutes after he was gone, 
I was packing. I knew he wasn’t 
coming back for any report. He 
was coming back for me, and it 
didn’t much matter to him if I 
wanted to come, or not. I was com- 
ing, or staying here — dead. 

What I didn’t realize is that they 
wanted me to run, to get out where 
I could be taken with a minimum 
of interference. 

They got me the other side of 
Blythe, in the middle of nowhere. 
A clear night in the desert, and 
headlights coming up from behind 
and then the big, black car crowd- 
ing me off the flat road, into the 
sand. And darkness. 



P EERING sighed and shook his 
head. “Corruption, Werig? Was 
it the corruption, or the girl?” 
“I’ve made my report,” I said. 
“Don’t worry about them. They’ve 
got enough to worry about without 
worrying about us.” 

“Another war, it looks like,” 
Deering said. “It could be the last 
one, you know. What was the girl 
— your wife like, Fred? Was she 
pretty?” 

“Beautiful,” I said. 

“And the people — fear, is it 
fear?” 

“I don’t know. Their vice is fear, 
but they have some virtues.” 
Deering’s voice was quiet. “Jars 
wanted me to ask you — about your 
wife. Where is she? Is she coming 



with you? It was forbidden.” 

“I don’t know where she is, she’s 
not coming with me, and I know 
it was forbidden. But where is Jars? 
He has been avoiding me, hasn’t 
he? Why?” 

“He has been pleading for you, 
before the assembly.” Deering rose, 
and went to the window, to look 
out. “Who will win this war that’s 
shaping up among the huddlers, 
Fred?” 

“I don’t know. I’m not sure I 
give a damn.” 

Deering continued to look out the 
window. “The gray nation, the 
mixed nation, this America; they 
have some promise of the light, 
have they not?” 

“Some.” 

“But this black nation, this na- 
tion of robots, there is no chance of 
of light there?” 

“Not under their present leaders. 
If they should win the war the 
planet would be set back five hun- 
dred years.” 

Deering shook his head, and 
turned to face me sadly. “It would 
be worse than that. If they should 
win this war shaping up, there 
would be no planet for them to 
rule.” 

I stared at him, not believing, 
still so bound up in my trip I 
couldn’t believe his words. Love , — 
faith, fear, Jean — were running 
through my mind. And Jean . ? 

Deering answered everything for 
me. “We can’t take the chance,” he 
said. “We will abolish the planet. 
The assembly so decided this mom-

new and interesting properties of 
metals and the causes and distribu-

a modem classroom lecturer is re- 
markable. His programs are of only 
15 minutes duration, and yet, in 
even that short time, some of the 
most complex phases of science are 
made clear and interesting — open- 
ing up a whole new world of un- 
derstanding for his vast audience, 
no matter what the age or educa- 
tion. 



T HE gray-haired, keen-eyed pro- 
fessor was bom in Illinois forty- 
four years ago, raised in Ohio, 
graduated from Ohio Wesleyan 
University and got his Ph.D. from 
the University of Michigan. Inci- 
dentally, the thesis for his doctor- 
ate was a dissertation on astro- 
physics. Galled “The best plane- 
tarium man in America” by the 
famed Dr. Harlow Shapely of Har- 
vard, the youthful Doctor has been 
the director of two plane tariums — 
Fels Planetarium in Philadelphia, 
and Moorehead at the University 
of North Carolina. 

When he’s not writing newspa- 
per articles, delivering lectures, or 
appearing as a guest on various ra- 



dio and television shows (he’s flown 
over 125,000 miles to meet such 
commitments in the last two years) 
Roy Marshall handles a job as edu- 
cational director of a radio and 
television station in Philadelphia. 
Here he supervises, expedites and 
very often produces and directs ap- 
proximately nine hours of educa- 
tional radio and television shows. 
These shows are used regularly by 
teachers as assignments and have 
aided the further understanding of 
countless children. He also must, of 
course, prepare his own script and 
arrange and rehearse the network 
show “The Nature of Things”. He 
recently completed a book titled 
“The Nature of Things — from the 
hearts of the atoms to the ends of 
the universe”, and is now hard at 
work on a second book. 

Dr. Marshall resigned his posi- 
tion as director of the Morehead 
Planetarium and Chairman of the 
Department of Astronomy at the 
University of North Carolina last 
year because he felt he needed 
more leisure time, in which to con- 
centrate on broadcasting and rais-

growing sons. “I just didn’t have 
any home life,” he explained. To-

m Kenzie REPORT 

By Mark Clifton 

Illustrated by Kelly Freas 



T HAT KENZIE MacKenzie was 
a mad scientist hardly showed 
at all. To see him ambling down 
the street in loose jointed manner, 
with sandy hair uncombed, blue 
eyes looking vaguely beyond nor- 
mal focus, you might think here 
was a young fellow dreaming over 
how his gal looked last night. It 
might never occur to you that he 
was thinking of — ants. 

Of course, we fellows in the ex- 
perimental lab all knew it, but 
Kenzie wasn’t too hard to get 
along with. In fact, he could usual- 
ly be counted on to pull us out of 
a technical hole. We put up with 
him through a certain fondness, 
maybe even a little pride. It gave 
us a harmless subject to talk about 
when security was too rigid on 
other things. 

Our Department Chief knew it, 
but Kenzie had solved quite a few 
knotty electronics problems. The 
Chief never has been too particu- 



lar to see credit get back to the guy 
who earned it. We guessed he fig- 
ured having Kenzie there was 
profitable to him. In fact, the lit- 
tle redhead in payroll told me the 
Chief was drawing quite a few 
bonus checks. 

Personnel probably didn’t know 
about it. Kenzie’s papers, buried 
deep in the files, wouldn’t show it; 
because about the only question 
they had not asked us was, “Where 
do you stand on the matter of 
ants?” 

There was an unwritten law in 
the lab for nobody ever to mention 
insects, or even elderly female rela- 
tives. I guess that was why it wasn’t 
mentioned to the new guy, name of 
Robert Pringle. This fellow Pringle 
worked along for a couple weeks 
and showed us he had the old 
know-how in his fingers. A capable 
tech, a good joe, and we thought 
we were lucky to get him. 

On this particular morning, it 



63 




64 



MARK CLIFTON 



happened that Pringle was work- 
ing at the bench next to Kenzie. 
Being a talented tech, like the rest 
of us, his mind naturally ran along 
more than one channel at the same 
time. I expect he was really sur- 
prised at the reaction he got when 
he shouted out to the room at 
large. 

“Hey, fellows,” he yelled. “I got 
little green bugs on my roses. What 
do you do about it?” 

The silence made him look up 
from his work, and he couldn’t 
help npticing we all stood there 
with clinched hands and gritted 
teeth. We were watching Kenzie, 
who snapped the juice off his 
soldering iron and pointed the iron 
at Pringle. 

“Those,” said Kenzie in a hol- 
low, impressive voice, “are aphis. 
If you will look closer, Pringle, you 
will see among them — ants. The 
aphid is to the ant as the dairy cow 
is to the human. Those ants are 
aphid herders, carefully tending 
and milking their flock.” 

“Here we go again,” moaned 
one of the fellows across the lab. 

“The ants are a highly intelli- 
gent life form,” Kenzie went on. “I 
would explain it to you in detail, 
but I am in the middle of a prob- 
lem at this moment.” 

“Thank heaven for that,” an- 
other tech ground out the words. 

“Suffice it to say,” Kenzie ig- 
nored all interruptions, “Man 
would well occupy himself trying 
to communicate with them.” 

The Chief came to the doorway 
of his little office down at the end 
of the lab. He looked us all over 
patiently and knowingly. 

“Now give him your syllogism, 



Kenzie,” he said quietly, “so we 
can all get back to work.” 

“You may reflect on this, Prin- 
gle,” Kenzie stated and waved his 
soldering iron in the air. 

“One: Man wants to communi- 
cate with intelligent life from other 
planets or the stars. 

“Two: We know from observa- 
tion the ants communicate with 
one another. 

“Ergo : Before we reach so far as 
to contact extra terrestrial intelli- 
gence, had we not better occupy 
our time with solving a much sim- 
pler communications problem; to 
wit: communicate with the ants? 
How can we expect to solve com- 
munication with really alien beings 
from the stars, when we have not 
learned to communicate with the 
intelligent beings at our very 
feet?” 

All over the room we sighed 
heavily with relief. We knew the 
syllogism was the conclusion, the 
Sunday punch. The boy had really 
cut it short this time. Usually he 
was good for a solid hour with 
facts and figures about how ants 
built bridges and such stuff. 

We all looked at Pringle’s face, 
expecting to see the embarrassed 
and sheepish grin. This was the 
usual reaction of a stranger when 
he first met up with Kenzie’s syllo- 
gism. It horrified us to see, instead, 
his shining eyes. We heard him say 
enthusiastically. 

“That’s just how I’ve always felt 
about it, Kenzie. It’s a pleasure to 
meet a man who isn’t afraid of 
thinking.” 

“Oh, no-o-o!” we all groaned 
out in a chorus. 

“Only,” Pringle said dubiously, 




THE KENZIE REPORT

and our hopes began to arise again. 
“Only I’ve been thinking more 
along the line of termites.” Our 
hopes fell and were shattered. 

We heard the Chief moan to 
himself and saw him turn and al- 
most run back into his office. 

“Two of ’em now,” he was 
mumbling over and over. “Two of 
’em now. It ain’t worth it. It ain’t 
worth it.” He sat down heavily and 
buried his head in his arms across 
the top of his desk. Kenzie was 
watching him too, like he was won- 
dering what had got into the Chief. 
Then Kenzie turned back to Prin- 
gle. 

“Ants,” he said with determina- 
tion. 

“Termites,” Pringle answered 
him stubbornly. Kenzie glared at 
Pringle for a minute, then his face 
cleared. 

“Why not both of them?” he 
asked, like a fellow who was will- 
ing to be big about it. 

“Sure, why not?” Pringle came 
his half way also. Then, like he 
wasn’t to be outdone in generosity. 
“Ants first, then termites later.” 

Solemnly the two shook hands. 
They went back to their work at 
the bench, and there was an aura 
of understanding and accord at 
that end of the room thick enough 
to be felt. 

“I hope you insect lovers will be 
very happy together,” the grid ex- 
pert mumbled to their backs. The 
rest of us also settled back into our 
varied jobs and problems. But we 
worked as if we momentarily ex- 
pected an earthquake to rock us. 
Our hands were not quite steady. 
Our eyes were not firm and pierc- 
ing. We almost held our breaths. 



For a wonder, we agreed with the 
Chief. Two of ’em now. 

The days passed and nothing 
more was said. More than ever 
now, we enforced the taboo on in- 
sects. We didn’t mention trees, or 
wood, or even the conditional sub- 
junctive. Would sounded like 
wood. Wood might bring up the 
thought of termites. 

We could see the Chief was 
weighing the advantages of keep- 
ing them against the risks of upset- 
ting the department constantly. As 
we expected, greed won. We knew 
he would not risk giving up the 
prestige and extra bonuses he got 
for Kenzie’ s work. And he knew he 
had to keep those discoveries com- 
ing, because our management has 
a short memory of what a guy has 
done in the past. 

The Chief even let Kenzie have 
Pringle as his own personal tech. 
It served two purposes. It isolated 
them from the rest of us. It made 
Kenzie happy. 

I will say for the lads, they spent 
most of their time on Company 
problems, at first. But gradually, 
on one corner of Kenzie’s bench, a 
gadget began to take shape. The 
two of them worked on it 
when there were no urgent, 
frantic, must-be-out- today- without- 
fail problems to be solved first. 
None of us could figure out the 
purpose of the mechanism. 

We knew if we couldn’t figure 
it, the Chief couldn’t. But we could 
practically see him rub his hands in 
glee when he thought of the extra 
bonus he might get for this new 
gadget. 

Of course the Chief wasn’t a 
complete slouch as an electronics 




66 



MARK CLIFTON 



engineer. But it was a long time 
since he did his study, and he had 
grown hazy by spending too many 
years as an administrator. The 
word got around that for hours at 
a time, after we had gone home, 
the Chief would stand at Kenzie’s 
bench. 

The way we reasoned it, he fig- 
ured he ought to know something 
about the gadget when he took it 
in to Old Rock Jaw, and palmed it 
off as his latest discovery. We also 
reasoned that since we couldn’t 
figure it, the Chief must have been 
an awfully troubled man. 

Obviously, it had something to 
do with microwave transmission 
and reception. There was the usual 
high-frequency condensor, the mag- 
natron tubes, the tuning cavities. 
All company stock, of course. But 
then none of us ever worried about 
cost. That was the Chiefs prob- 
lem. 

He didn’t worry much about it 
either, except at budget time. Then 
there were screams of anguish from 
the front office over experimental 
requisitions. Every year, Old Rock 
Jaw promised to fire us all, if we 
didn’t cut costs, but in a couple of 
weeks we always forgot about it. 

Trouble was, the Chief had been 
getting edgy about costs lately, so 
we knew it was about time for the 
annual budget battle. Significantly, 
he didn’t say a word to Kenzie 
about the gadget. 

A S LUCK would have it, I was 
working late one night on a 
special permit. My bench is over in 
a wing of the lab, and I guess the 
Chief forgot I was around. I saw a 



very pretty scene. 

The Chief had built up a habit 
of staying late so he could stand 
and study over the Kenzie gadget. 
He never touched it, though. He 
knew enough not to bother any- 
thing, because we all knew how bit- 
ter Kenzie was when anybody 
touched his things. 

The Chief was standing there 
this evening when the General 
Manager, Old Rock Jaw, was 
showing some important person- 
ages through the plant after hours. 
They came through the lab door, 
and I saw scrambled eggs and fruit 
salad shining all over bulging uni- 
forms. There was also one little, 
geezik in a pin-striped suit. Old 
Rock Jaw was talking, as usual. 

. and it is from this room, 
gentlemen,” he was saying, “That 
some of those revolutionary discov- 
eries emanate!” 

Then he caught sight of the 
Chief, who had hastily picked up 
a cold soldering iron and was ten- 
tatively touching a random point 
on the new mechanism. 

“Ah-h!” Old Rock Jaw ex- 
claimed with satisfaction. “Here is 
our chief scientist now. Still at 
work. He watches no clock, gentle- 
men, He knows no time. His whole 
life is wrapped up in his research!” 

The Chief didn’t look around, 
but bent closer to the soldering 
point. He looked like he hoped 
they would limit their inspection to 
a cursory look about and then re- 
tire. I hoped they would too, I 
didn’t want them to see me. 

But Old Rock Jaw, in more of a 
blowhard mood even than usual, 
couldn’t let well enough alone. He 
came up close to the Chief, and 




THE KENZIE REPORT 



67 



looked over his shoulder at the 
mechanism. He was even more ig- 
norant than the Chief, so I knew 
he wouldn’t recognize any of it. 

“Don’t let us disturb you, Al- 
fred,” he breathed in a hushed 
voice. “But could you tell the gen- 
tlemen what you are working on 
now?” He cleared his throat im- 
portantly and said, “I might add 
that everyone here has been se- 
curity cleared, Alfred, so you may 
speak freely.” 

The Chief still did not lift his 
eyes from his work. He didn’t dare. 
He carefully turned an unconnect- 
ed control knob a hairsbreadth with 
utmost deliberation and precision. 

“Multimicrofrequidometer,” the 
Chief mumbled, and buried his 
head still deeper into the mecha- 
nism. 

“Ah yes, of course. But you have 
a new hook up,” the General Man- 
ager bluffed. “I hardly recognized 
it at first. Startling!” he breathed. 

He looked around triumphantly 
at the impressed brass and braid. 
He looked pointedly at the pin- 
striped suit who probably con- 
trolled congressional purse strings. 

“Apparently he is at a point 
where he cannot divert his atten- 
tion to us, gentlemen,” he breathed 
in a hushed voice. He placed his 
fingers to his lips and began to tip- 
toe backwards toward the door. 

The beef trust in fancy uniform 
came up on their own toesies, and 
also tiptoed away from the genius 
scientist. By now, the genius was 
beginning to exude large drops of 
sweat. 

The door closed behind them, 
and the Chief dropped the cold 
soldering iron with a sigh of relief. 



He took hold of his tongue, where 
he must have been biting into it. 
He wiped his forehead and fingers 
with his breast-pocket handker- 
chief. 

Both the Chief and I heard the 
party walking down the hall and 
into another wing of the building. 
I still didn’t make a sound. It 
would never do for the Chief to 
know he had been observed. After 
a suitable time, the Chief, also, tip- 
toed out of the lab, and he was 
mumbling to himself as I have 
never seen him mumble before. 



S EVERAL DAYS later another 
thing appeared on Kenzie’s 
work bench. This time it was a 
large rectangular glass aquarium. 
It was filled with moist earth. Now 
here was something new in elec- 
tronics! 

We shook our heads. One of the 
techs, who fancied himself a psy- 
chologist, said the boys were suffer- 
ing from retrogressive dementia. 
They had gone so far back into 
childhood, they had to play sand 
box. The Chief overheard the tech, 
and spoke up plaintively. 

“But I don’t see any celluloid 
spade and bucket,” he said. He 
seemed relieved when we burst out 
laughing. 

His relief didn’t last long, how- 
ever. It changed to more worry 
when he saw the boys carefully 
sprinkling bread and meat crumbs 
over the surface of the sand. Then 
on top of that they dropped moist 
bits of cake icing. When Pringle 
brought down a marigold plant, all 
covered with aphis, and transplant- 
ed it in a comer of the aquarium, 




68 

the Chief again ran into his office 
and began to hold his head in his 
hands. 

More days passed. The gadget 
became a bristling porcupine of 
test clips. By now the boys had for- 
gotten they were working for the 
Company and spent practically all 
their time on the whoozits. The 
Chief became so fascinated, in a 
kind of horror-stricken manner, 
that he did not mention the aquar- 
ium to Kenzie at all. 

The rest of us also kept away 
from that side of the lab. Ever 
since Kenzie had started on the 
gadget, he had no time for us, or 
helping us with our problems. If 
we spoke to him he snapped back 
at us, until I guess all our noses 
were out of joint. By the time the 
aquarium appeared, we were ig- 
noring him and everything he did. 

In a few more weeks the aquar- 
ium was swarming with ants. It 
was easy to see their tunnels run- 
ning up and down the sides of the 
glass. I will say this for the boys. 
They set it in a huge pan of water. 
None of us could legitimately 
squawk about getting ants mixed 
up with our anatomy. 

The Chief showed he was mixed 
with disappointment and elation 
when the boys asked clearance to 
work nights in the lab. Disappoint- 
ed since he could no longer stay 
late and follow the progress; elated 
because the boys must really be 
getting hot. 

Annual budget time was getting 
closer, and we could see the wheels 
going around in his mind. It would 
be a nice thing if he could deliver 
the multiwhoozits gadget just be- 



^ MARK CLIFTON 

fore the big fight for appropria- 
tions. 

As far as we knew, the only in- 
terest the General Manager had 
shown was the time he asked the 
Chief in the hall how that multi- 
whoozits was coming along. Even 
in that question, it was evident Old 
Rock Jaw was asking out of a rare 
politeness only — there being no big 
shots around to impress. 

It was doubtful if the G.M. 
heard the Chief’s vague answer, 
because the old boy was mumbling 
to himself about rising costs and 
having to cut down expenses. He 
waddled on down the hall. He was 
still mumbling as he went, but both 
the Chief and I heard one sentence 
clearly. 

“And certain salaries and bo- 
nuses will have to be cut.” 

The Chief turned pale. 

So he granted Kenzie’ s request 
with alacrity — and hoped he would 
finish the gadget in time. 

For two more weeks the Chief 
waited patiently, or maybe impa- 
tiently. He knew the boys were 
working every night, because the 
security police complained about 
their pinochle game being inter- 
rupted to let Kenzie and Pringle in 
and out. 

Both the boys began to get a fe- 
verish look in their faces. Their 
cheeks grew hollow. Their eyes 
were bloodshot. Their regular work 
suffered even more. The Chief 
thought he was being considerate 
when he lifted some of their work 
and shoved it over to the rest of us. 

We were already sore at the boys 
and we didn’t take it too kindly. 
Just the same, we didn’t let our 
squawk get beyond the walls of the 




THE KENZIE REPORT 



69 



lab. No use letting that nosy Per- 
sonnel Department get an excuse 
to start holding hands, patting on 
the back, and radiating aid and 
comfort to all. 

Then — a certain Monday came. 



T HE CHIEF came in, a little late 
as usual. Some of the newer 
guys pretended to be busy, but we 
were all watching to see what he 
would do. There is a back door to 
the Chiefs office which he seldom 
uses and which he always keeps 
locked. But it opens into the lab 
wing right at my table. It wasn’t 
my fault, in fiddling around a little 
with the lock, it came unstuck and 
the door opened a little so I could 
hear what went on. 

When the Chief came in, both 
the boys were busy dismantling the 
gadget. Discouragement and hope- 
lessness were written all over their 
faces, in the dejected slope of their 
shoulders, in the lackadaisical 
movements of their arms. Piece by 
piece, through the glass partition 
of his office wall, the Chief 
watched the gadget being taken 
apart. Each piece was carefully 
taken back and placed in stock for 
re-use. 

That alone was enough to create 
great alarm for their sanity. Imag- 
ine a technician putting a piece 
back to be used over! 

Finally the Chief could bear it 
no longer. He called them into his 
office. He carefully shut the door, 
but he didn’t notice the back door 
swung open a little farther. I 
found it necessary to work close to 
the crack, and if I turned around, 
I could get a good view of the 



entire office. 

The Chief waved the boys into 
chairs across from his desk. He sat 
down and placed his fingertips to- 
gether. Even then, I could see his 
hands were shaking. He leaned for- 
ward and asked with careful sym- 
pathy in his voice. 

“Didn’t it work?” 

“Yeah,” Kenzie answered in a 
bored voice. “It worked.” I was 
surprised at Kenzie’s voice. Usually 
he talked with the concise enunci- 
ation of a professor. Now he sound- 
ed like maybe just a good lab tech. 

“Then why are you dismantling 
it?” the Chief asked with a wor- 
ried frown. 

“It wouldn’t be good for people 
to know about it,” Pringle burst 
out. 

“I don’t understand,” the Chief 
faltered. Then desperately, “Look, 
fellows. I’ve given you a lotta lee- 
way. You’ve sluffed your work 
something terrible. That’s all right 
to an extent. I’ve covered for you.” 

“Thanks, Chief,” Kenzie said 
drily. 

“But Old Rock — er — the Gen- 
eral Manager,” the Chief com- 
plained, “knows I’ve been working 
on something. Now what with bud- 
gets coming on, and all, I gotta 
have something to show!” 

“You’ve been working on some- 
thing — ” Pringle exclaimed. 

“I mean my department has,” 
the Chief covered himself hastily. 
“I’m responsible for what goes on 
in my department, you know. I 
gotta have some kind of an expla- 
nation.” He was almost wailing 
now. “What with budgets coming 
on, and all.” 

“Make up your own explana-

tion,” Kenzie answered disinterest- 
edly. “It’s a cinch you can’t give 
out with the real one.” 

The Chief began to wheedle. 
“You two boys know the explana- 
tion. Why can’t you tell me? This 
is your Chief who’s talking, boys. 
The one who has always stood by 
you and covered for you. Remem- 
ber? You just gotta tell me, boys.” 
I saw Pringle and Kenzie look at 
one another. 

“I guess he’s right, Ken,” Prin- 
gle said. “That is, if he promises 
never to tell anybody.” 

“Yeah. I guess so.” Kenzie nod- 
ded his head in agreement. “We 
owe him that much for just letting 
us alone.” 

The Chief let out a big sigh of 
relief. 

“It’s about ants,” Kenzie began. 

“Now, now, Kenzie boy,” the 
Chief interrupted hurriedly. “Let’s 
stay on the subject, shall we? Let’s 
not get off on that tangent again, 
Kenzie boy. Shall we?” 

“Nuts,” Kenzie said. 

“But this is about ants, Chief,” 
Pringle answered. Then shrewdly, 
“But first you gotta promise, 
Chief.” 

“All right, I promise,” the Chief 
acceded testily. 

“It’s about ants,” Kenzie re- 
peated stubbornly. The Chief 
winced, but he held his peace. 

“They’re intelligent,” Kenzie 
said profoundly, and stopped. 

“I know,” the Chief prompted. 
“I know, Kenzie boy. You’ve been 
saying that all along.” 

“I communicated with them,” 
Kenzie said flatly. 

“You what?” The Chiefs eyes 
bugged out. I guess mine did too. 



“Sure,” Kenzie answered. “After 
a fashion, that is. In their anthers 
they’ve got a chitin cell diaphragm. 
Modified cellular structure. They 
communicate with a sort of micro- 
wave. Roughly you might say it 
generates and radiates like our 
brain wave. Roughly, very roughly. 
This chitin diaphragm picks up the 
microwave like our ears pick up 
sound. Roughly, that is.” 

“But that’s wonderful,” the 
Chief glowed. It didn’t take much 
imagination to see him in the Gen- 
eral Manager’s office explaining 
how his multiwhoozits gadget 
worked. Maybe nothing immedi- 
ately commercial about it, but 
when the publicity office got hold 
of it — man, it would mean plenty 
of free publicity for the Company. 
And how Old Rock Jaw loved free 
publicity! 

“We tuned in on them,” Kenzie 
was saying. “By putting different 
kinds of food around, and by mak- 
ing different kinds of disturbances, 
we worked out a crude sort of vo- 
cabulary.” 

“You did — ” the Chief ex- 
claimed. 

“Nothing fancy, you under- 
stand,” Kenzie belittled his 
achievement. “But enough so when 
we broadcast a sugar wave, they 
came running to the surface to see 
where it was. When we broadcast a 
water wave, they rushed to the ant 
nursery and started carrying eggs 
to high ground.” 

“Glory be — ” the Chief breathed. 
In his eyes there was the vision of 
world renowned scientists patting 
him on the back. Maybe even more 
important, Old Rock Jaw was 
actually smiling, and telling him he

could have unlimited funds in his 
budget. 

“Sure,” Kenzie said bitterly. 
“Sure that was all very fine. Big 
shots, we were going to be, Pringle 
and me. First time in history man 
had talked with an insect. Maybe 
even get our pictures in the paper, 
same as if we’d murdered some- 
body. Fame!” 

“Yeah,” Pringle chimed in. 
“First step in learning how to com- 
municate with an alien mind. 
Nuts!” 

“I don’t get it,” the Chief stam- 
mered. “What’s wrong with that?” 

“Well, we went on perfecting the 
vocabulary,” Kenzie said. “You 
know. Fining it down. Had the 
little beggars practically standing 
on their heads at times with our 
wave.” He grinned at the memory 
and seemed to shake off some of 
his lethargy. 

“You shoulda been here the 
night Pringle had them marching 
in formation.” His face fell again. 

“We kept on improving the gad- 
get,” he said with hangdog atti- 
tude. “We still hadn’t made direct 
communication, you understand. 
Nothing like ‘How do you do, Mrs. 
Ant? This is Kenzie MacKenzie, 
human, talking.’ ” Then he sneered 
at his memory. 

“With our microwave we could 
make them do things. But hell, you 
can make them run out of the 
ground by pouring water down 
their hole. That’s not communica- 
tion! We couldn’t seem to contact 
them direct — make them know we 
were communicating.” 

“But you still — ” the Chief said. 
He had visions of every home using 
a gadget to broadcast “keep away” 



signals to ant pests. 

“Our gadget was still crude at 
that point,” Kenzie interrupted. 
“We fined it down, more and 
more. That’s when we began to 
pick up the star static.” 

“Star static?” the Chief faltered. 

“He wouldn’t know about that,” 
Pringle said, and I could detect 
contempt in his voice, even if the 
Chief didn’t. 

“Sure he would,” Kenzie cor- 
rected. “Everybody knows about 
the fifty or so stars that send out 
continuous radio signals, and how 
we’ve been trying for years to un- 
scramble them.” 

“Why certainly,” the Chief said, 
so positively I knew he hadn’t 
heard of it before. 

“Anyway,” Kenzie said. “The 
more we worked out the vocabu- 
lary code, the more the star signals 
began to fit right into it. So we de- 
cided to break up the thing, and 
forget all about ants. Honest Chief, 
you’ll never hear me mention the 
word again.” 

“Termites either,” Pringle 
chimed in. 

“But I still don’t understand,” 
the Chief complained. “It still all 
sounds marvelous. I just don’t un- 
derstand.” 

“Draw him a picture,” Pringle 
said disgustedly. 

“Okay,” Kenzie acceded. “How 
many years would you say ants 
have been on earth, Chief?” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” the Chief 
answered. “Quite a few, I’d say.” 

“Yeah,” Kenzie . said drily. 
“Quite a few. At least a million. 
Unchanged. A perfect life form 
with a perfect civilization. So per- 
fect, nature hasn’t seen any need to 




72 



MARK CLIFTON 



change them for a million years.” 

“So what?” the Chief asked. 
“They’re nothing. We come along 
and make them do nip ups.” 

“Yeah,” Kenzie was bitter again. 
“We humans go around talking 
about how brave and smart we are. 
How someday we might even get 
so smart we’ll contact other intelli- 
gent races on other worlds. Yeah, 
we’re smart. You know those star 
radiations?” 

“That’s not my specialty, you 
know,” the Chief answered cau- 
tiously. 

“Some of those radiations started 
out from their home planet a mil- 
lion light years ago,” Pringle said 
quietly. 

“So what again?” the Chief 
asked. 

“Those radiations,” Kenzie said, 
“happen to be communications be- 
tween the galaxies — beamed at the 
ants. Sort of a continuous radio 
program broadcast universe wide. 
It happens the ants, maybe ter- 
mites, maybe other insects, are 
spread through all the galaxies. It 
happens they are the dominant in- 
telligent race throughout the uni- 
verse.” He shrugged in disgust. 

“Us big brave humans,” he said 
contemptuously. “Someday we 



might even reach Mars. Hell, those 
ants have been colonizing for hun- 
dreds of millions of years. They’re 
still communicating. They are the 
real intelligence on the earth!” 

He crushed a cigarette fiercely 
into a glass ash tray on the desk. 

“Only thing man has got, or 
ever had, was his ego. He’s got to 
believe he’s top dog, or else he folds 
and quits. Yeah, we’re smart all 
right. Hell, we’re so far down the 
scale the ants don’t even recognize 
us as a life form at all.” 

Pringle nodded soberly. “Yeah,” 
he said to the Chief, “how would 
you like to explain a gadget that 
proved ants have more brains than 
you have?” 

The Chief looked at them with 
incredulous eyes. 

He was still staring at them si- 
lently, with a bloodless face, when 
the office messenger came in and 
told him the General Manager 
wished to see him in his office to 
discuss budgets. 

I closed the back office door 
quietly and went back to work. 
The other guys clustered around 
and wanted to know what I heard. 

“Nothing,” I said, and looked 
them straight in the eye. “Nothing 
at all.”

FIELD IMP 

By Gene Hunter 



K IAL was disgusted with the 
slow, cumbersome train. He 
disliked using this uncomfortable 
means of travel, but since he want- 
ed to learn more about these 
strange creatures who were his an- 
cestors, he had decided to try to be- 
come used to their ways. 

He was lonely in this strange, 
backward age and when he unex- 
pectedly saw another being like 
himself in the same coach, he has- 
tened to make his presence known. 
He introduced himself and asked 
politely : 

“When are you from?” 

“8000,” the other replied. 
“Name’s Broyk, from VII Galaxy.” 
“I’m from out XIX way my- 
self,” Kial said. “Just a country 
boy. But 8000 — that’s only a period 
ahead of my own time. Maybe you 
could tell me ...” 

“Ah, ah!” the other admonished. 
“Remember the First Law of 
Thek!” 

“Oh, Center,” Kial grumbled. 
“I know: ‘One may not divulge 



any scientific, technical or social in- 
formation to anyone from his own 
past whom he may meet at an 
equidistant point in a Thek-travel.’ 
I forgot.” 

“Bad,” Broyk said. Then he add- 
ed, almost jokingly: “You wouldn’t 
want to be marooned in this dismal 
era, would you?” 

Kial shuddered. “Of course not. 
But the Laws seem so ridiculous.” 

“Not a bit,” Broyk said, warm- 
ing up to the subject. “It’s very 
simple, really. Same principle that 
doesn’t allow anyone to Thek- 
travel into the future. 

“Look. I’m from 8000. Say that 
I went into 12,000, where I memo- 
rized as much information as I 
could on some subject such as 
medicine. So I return to 8000, re- 
taining all such knowledge in my 
mind that’s been learned in four 
periods. Therefore, I’d have knowl- 
edge that wasn’t dreamed of in my 
own time, but was discovered some- 
time during the next four peripds. 
But then it couldn’t be discovered. 




74 

because I’d brought it back to 8000 
and — well, I’m no Logician, but 
you see my point.” 

“Oh, it’s reasonable, I suppose,” 
Kial admitted. “I realize the Laws 
are really for our own good. By the 
way — Pm here on a field trip to 
gather material for my thesis on 
Advanced Therapeutical Psycholo- 
gy and its development since the 
Twentieth Century. What phase of 
this era are you here to study?” 

“I — Fm afraid I couldn’t tell 
you that,” Broyk said. “It’s of rath- 
er a secret nature and . .” 

“You mean we might violate a 
Law and be stuck here for good — 
is that it?” 

“Yes — in a way.” 

Frightened, Kial let the matter 
drop. His gaze wandered through 
the coach, examining the other 
passengers with interest. As time 
travelers from a different space- 
time plane from their 20th Century 
ancestors, he and Broyk were nat- 
urally invisible to their fellow trav- 
elers. 

Two pompous old gentlemen 
were lighting cigars and Kial was 
about to remark on the habit of 
smoking when he noticed an even 
more remarkable phenomenon. A 
few seats ahead of them sat a good- 
looking young couple, oblivious to 
others about them. 

“Look!” Kial cried excitedly. 
“Lovers! Honey mooners! I’ve read 
about such things! Isn’t it disgust- 
ing?” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” Broyk said, 
a little wistfully. “I sometimes 
think it was a mistake for Center to 
do away with sex. It must have 
been interesting.” 



GENE HUNTER 

“Atavist!” Kial snapped in hor- 
ror. 

Had his peoples’ emotional 
make-up provided for blushing, 
Kial would undoubtedly have 
turned beet-red. Broyk’s words had 
caused him acute embarrassment. 



A S HE SAT reflecting upon his 
strange companion, he sud- 
denly began to feel a sensation he 
had often heard about but never 
before had experienced. Terror 
and dismay filled him as he sought 
to throw off the probing finger that 
was penetrating his mind. 

He looked at Broyk. There was 
the faintest notion of a smile on 
the other’s face as he said: “Yes, 
Kial — I am a Telepath.” 

Kial’s mind reeled. He felt him- 
self on the brink of some gigantic 
abyss and then, as suddenly as it 
had come, the searching sensation 
faded away. 

“Since you are unable to enter 
my mind,” Broyk said calmly, ”it’s 
only fair that I tell you about my- 
self. You were right — I’m an ata- 
vist. Even in period 8000, such 
things can happen. Always such 
creatures are destroyed after their 
first psychotests, but my case was 
different. The Controller who bred 
me was only a dabbler in such 
things. I was a failure, but he took 
a fancy to me. I was allowed to 
mature secretly — few people knew 
of my existence. When I reached 
my majority my presence became 
dangerous and I was sent back into 
time to try and find the proper 
place for myself. And I think I’ve 
found it — here!” 

Kial was a very amazed young

man. “But such a barbarous age,” 
he complained. “Sex and atom 
bombs and everything . .” 

“Remember,” Broyk smiled, 
“these people are the forebears of 
the geniuses who created Center 
and the Galactic Empire. They’ll 
survive, despite their barbarism. 
The existence of Center is proof.” 
“It’s rather horrible to contem- 
plate,” Kial said thoughtfully, 
calmer now, “and yet, this might 
really be a great age. In a way I 
almost envy you.” 

“Of course you do,” Broyk said. 
“You have certain tendencies — 
they bother you, although you 
manage to hide them well. I dis- 
covered them when I took the lib- 
erty of telepathing you. Artificial 
Genetics isn’t perfect, even in our 
time — perhaps because we origi- 
nally sprang from man. Perhaps 
we’ll never be quite perfect, be- 
cause of that, even after thousands 
of periods of breeding.” 

Kial took another look at the 



loving young couple. “It — it might 
be fun, after all.” 

Broyk laughed. “You needn’t en- 
vy me at all, you know.” 

Kial frowned. 

“I’m telling you about myself,” 
Broyk went on, “I have also told 
you of a specific condition existing 
a period ahead of your own time. 
Remember the First Law?” 

“Center!” 

“We’re marooned in the Twen- 
tieth Century. You have to accept 
it.” 

“But what will we do ?” Kial’s 
mind was reeling again. 

“Since we’ve already broken the 
First Law,” Broyk said, “we may 
just as well break the Second: ‘No 
Thek-traveler may enter the body 
of a native of a foreign space- 
time . .’ ” 

The young lovers kissed again 
and this time there seemed to be 
an added zest, even to their pas- 
sionate embrace.

What was the mystery of this great ship from the 
dark, deep reaches of space? For, within its death- 
filled chambers — was the avenue of life! 



DERELICT 

By Alan E. Nourse 

Illustrated by Ed Emsh 



J OHN SABO, second in com- 
mand, sat bolt upright in his 
bunk, blinking wide-eyed at the 
darkness. The alarm was scream- 
ing through the Satellite Station, 
its harsh, nerve- jarring clang echo- 
ing and re-echoing down the metal 
corridors, penetrating every nook 
and crevice and cubicle of the 
lonely outpost, screaming incredi- 
bly through the dark sleeping pe- 
riod. Sabo shook the sleep from his 
eyes, and then a panic of fear burst 
into his mind. The alarm! Tum- 
bling out of his bunk in the dark- 
ness, he crashed into the far bulk- 
head, staggering giddily in the im- 
possible gravity as he pawed about 
for his magnaboots, his heart 
pounding fiercely in his ears. The 
alarm! Impossible, after so long, 
after these long months of bitter 
waiting — In the corridor he col- 
lided with Brownie, looking like a 
frightened gnome, and he growled 

77 



profanity as he raced down the 
corridor for the Central Control. 

Frightened eyes turned to him as 
he blinked at the bright lights of 
the room. The voices rose in a con- 
fused, anxious babble, and he 
shook his head and swore, and 
ploughed through them toward the 
screen. “Kill that damned alarm!” 
he roared, blinking as he counted 
faces.' “Somebody get the Skipper 
out of his sack, pronto, and stop 
that clatter! What’s the trouble?” 

The radioman waved feebly at 
the view screen, shimmering on the 

great side panel. “We just picked it 

„„ » 
up — 

It was a ship, moving in from 
beyond Saturn’s rings, a huge, 
gray-black blob in the silvery 
screen, moving in toward the Sta- 
tion with ponderous, clumsy grace, 
growing larger by the second as it 
sped toward them. Sabo felt the 
fear spill over in his mind, driving 




78 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



out all thought, and he sank into 
the control chair like a well-trained 
automaton. His gray eyes were 
wide, trained for long military 
years to miss nothing; his fingers 
moved over the panel with deft 
skill. “Get the men to stations,” he 
growled, “and will somebody kind- 
ly get the Skipper down here, if he 
can manage to take a minute.” 
“I’m right here.” The little gray- 
ing man was at his elbow, staring 
at the screen with angry red eyes. 
“Who told you to shut off the 
alarm?” 

“Nobody told me. Everyone was 
here, and it was getting on my 
nerves.” 

“What a shame.” Captain 
Loomis’ voice was icy. “I give or- 
ders on this Station,” he said 
smoothly, “and you’ll remember 
it.” He scowled at the great gray 
ship, looming closer and closer. 
“What’s its course?” 

“Going to miss us by several 
thousand kilos at least. Look at 
that thing! It’s traveling ” 

“Contact it! This is what we’ve 
been waiting for.” The captain’s 
voice was hoarse. 

Sabo spun a dial, and cursed. 
“No luck. Can’t get through. It’s 
passing us — ” 

“Then grapple it, stupid! You 
want me to wipe your nose, too?” 
Sabo’s face darkened angrily. 
With slow precision he set the 
servo fixes on the huge gray hulk 
looming up in the viewer, and then 
snapped the switches sharply. Two 
small servos shoved their blunt 
noses from the landing port of the 
Station, and slipped silently into 
space alongside. Then, like a pair 
of trained dogs, they sped on their 



beams straight out from the Station 
toward the approaching ship. The 
intruder was dark, moving at tre- 
mendous velocity past the Station, 
as though unaware of its existence. 
The servos moved out, and sud- 
denly diverged and reversed, twist- 
ing in long arcs to come alongside 
the strange ship, finally moving in 
at the same velocity on either side. 
There was a sharp flash of contact 
power; then, like a mammoth slow- 
motion monster, the ship jerked in 
midspace and turned a graceful 
end-for-end arc as the servo-grap- 
plers gripped it like leeches and 
whined, glowing ruddy with the 
jolting power flowing through 
them. Sabo watched, hardly 
breathing, until the great ship spun 
and slowed and stopped. Then it 
reversed direction, and the servos 
led it triumphantly back toward 
the landing port of the Station. 

Sabo glanced at the radioman, 
a frown creasing his forehead. 
“Still nothing?” 

“Not a peep.” 

He stared out at the great ship, 
feeling a chill of wonder and fear 
crawl up his spine. “So this is the 
mysterious puzzle of Saturn,” he 
muttered. “This is what we’ve been 
waiting for.” 

There was a curious eager light 
in Captain Loomis’ eyes as he 
looked up. “Oh, no. Not this.” 

“What?” 

“Not this. The ships we’ve seen 
before were tiny, flat.” His little 
eyes turned toward the ship, and 
back to Sabo’s heavy face. “This is 
something else, something quite 
different.” A smile curved his lips, 
and he rubbed his hands together. 
“We go out for trout and come 




derelict 



79 



back with a whale. This ship’s from 
space, deep space. Not from Sat- 
urn. This one’s from the stars.” 



T HE STRANGE ship hung at 
the side of the Satellite Station, 
silent as a tomb, still gently rotating 
as the Station slowly spun in its or- 
bit around Saturn. 

In the captain’s cabin the men 
shifted restlessly, uneasily facing 
the eager eyes of their captain. The 
old man paced the floor of the 
cabin, his white hair mussed, his 
face red with excitement. Even his 
carefully calm face couldn’t con- 
ceal the eagerness burning in his 
eyes as he faced the crew. “Still no 
contact?” he asked Sparks. 

The radioman shook his head 
anxiously. “Not a sign. I’ve tried 
every signal I know at every wave 
frequency that could possibly reach 
them. I’ve even tried a dozen fre- 
quencies that couldn’t possibly 
reach them, and I haven’t stirred 
them up a bit. They just aren’t an- 
swering.” 

Captain Loomis swung on the 
group of men. “All right, now, I 
want you to get this straight. This 
is our catch. We don’t know what’s 
aboard it, and we don’t know 
where it came from, but it’s our 
prize. That means not a word goes 
back home about it until we’ve 
learned all there is to learn. We’re 
going to get the honors on this one, 
not some eager Admiral back 
home — ” 

The men stirred uneasily, wor- 
ried eyes seeking Sabo’s face in 
alarm. “What about the law?” 
growled Sabo. “The law says ev- 
erything must be reported within 



two hours.” 

“Then we’ll break the law,” the 
captain snapped. “I’m captain of 
this Station, and those are your or- 
ders. You don’t need to worry 
about the law — I’ll see that you’re 
protected, but this is too big to 
fumble. This ship is from the stars. 
That means it must have an Inter- 
stellar drive. You know what that 
means. The Government will fall 
all over itself to reward us — ” 

Sabo scowled, and the worry 
deepened in the men’s faces. It was 
hard to imagine the Government 
falling all over itself for anybody. 
They knew too well how the Gov- 
ernment worked. They had heard 
of the swift trials, the harsh im- 
prisonments that awaited even the 
petty infringers. The Military Gov- 
ernment had no time to waste on 
those who stepped out of line, they 
had no mercy to spare. And the 
men knew that their captain was 
not in favor in top Government 
circles. Crack patrol commanders 
were not shunted into remote, life- 
less Satellite Stations if their stand 
in the Government was high. And 
deep in their minds, somehow, the 
men knew .they couldn’t trust this 
little, sharp-eyed, white-haired 
man. The credit for such a discov- 
ery as this might go to him, yes — 
but there would be little left for 
them. 

“The law — ” Sabo repeated 
stubbornly. 

“Damn the law! We’re stationed 
out here in this limbo to watch Sat- 
urn and report any activity we see 
coming from there. There’s noth- 
ing in our orders about anything 
else. There have been ships from 
there, they think, but not this ship.

The Government has spent billions 
trying to find an Interstellar, and 
never gotten to first base.” The 
captain paused, his eyes narrowing. 
“We’ll go aboard this ship,” he said 
softly. “We’ll find out what’s 
aboard it, and where it’s from, and 
we’ll take its drive. There’s been 
no resistance yet, but it could be 
dangerous. We can’t assume any- 
thing. The boarding party will re- 
port everything they find to me. 
One of them will have to be a drive 
man. That’s you, Brownie.” 

The little man with the sharp 
black eyes looked up eagerly. “I 
don’t know if I could tell any- 
thing — ” 

“You can tell more than anyone 
else here. Nobody else knows space 
drive. I’ll count on you. If you 
bring back a good report, perhaps 
we can cancel out certain — unfor- 
tunate items in your record. But 
one other should board with 
you — ” His eyes turned toward 
John Sabo. 

“Not me. This is your goat.” 
The mate’s eyes were sullen. “This 
is gross breach, and you know it. 
They’ll have you in irons when we 
get back. I don’t want anything to 
do with it.” 

“You’re under orders, Sabo. You 
keep forgetting.” 

“They’re illegal orders, sir!” 

“I’ll take responsibility for that.” 
Sabo looked the old man straight 
in the eye. “You mean you’d sell us 
down a rat hole to save your skin. 
That’s what you mean.” 

Captain Loomis’ eyes widened 
incredulously. Then his face dark- 
ened, and he stepped very close to 
the big man. “You’ll watch your 
tongue, I think,” he gritted. “Be 



careful what you say to me, Sabo. 
Be very careful. Because if you 
don’t, you'll be in irons, and we’ll 
see just how long you last when you 
get back home. Now you’ve got 
your orders. You’ll board the ship 
with Brownie.” 

The big man’s fists were 
clenched until the knuckles were 
white. “You don’t know what’s 
over there!” he burst out. “We 
could be slaughtered.” 

The captain’s smile was unpleas- 
ant. “That would be such a pity,” 
he murmured. “I’d really hate to 
see it happen — ” 



T HE SHIP hung dark and si- 
lent, like a shadowy ghost. No 
flicker of light could be seen 
aboard it; no sound nor faintest 
sign of life came from the tall, dark 
hull plates. It hung there, huge and 
imponderable, and swung around 
with the Station in its silent orbit. 

The men huddled about Sabo 
and Brownie, helping them into 
their pressure suits, checking their 
equipment. They had watched the 
little scanning beetles crawl over 
the surface of the great ship, ex- 
amining, probing every nook and 
crevice, reporting crystals, and 
metals, and irons, while the board- 
ing party prepared. And still the 
radioman waited alertly for a flick- 
er of life from the solemn giant. 

Frightened as they were of their 
part in the illegal secrecy, the arriv- 
al of the ship had brought a 
change in the crew, lighting fires of 
excitement in their eyes. They 
moved faster, their voices were 
lighter, more cheerful. Long 
months on the Station had worn on 




derelict

their nerves — out of contact with 
their homes, on a mission that was 
secretly jeered as utter Governmen- 
tal folly. Ships had been seen, 
years before, disappearing into the 
sullen bright atmospheric crust of 
Saturn, but there had been no sign 
of anything since. And out there, 
on the lonely guard Station, nerves 
had run ragged, always waiting, al- 
ways watching, wearing away even 
the iron discipline of their military 
background. They grew bitterly 
weary of the same faces, the same 
routine, the constant repetition of 
inactivity. And through the months 
they had watched with increasing 
anxiety the conflict growing be- 
tween the captain and his bitter, 
sullen -eyed second-in-command, 
John Sabo. 

And then the ship had come, in- 
credibly, from the depths of space, 
and the tensions of loneliness were 
forgotten in the flurry of activity. 
The locks whined and opened as 
the two men moved out of the Sta- 
tion on the little propulsion sleds, 
linked to the Station with light silk 
guy ropes. Sabo settled himself on 
the sled, cursing himself for falling 
so foolishly into the captain’s 
scheme, cursing his tongue for 
wandering. And deep within him 
he felt a new sensation, a vague 
uneasiness and insecurity that he 
had not felt in all his years of mili- 
tary life. The strange ship was a 
variant, an imponderable factor 
thrown suddenly into his small 
world of hatred and bitterness, 
forcing him into unknown terri- 
tory, throwing his mind into a wel- 
ter of doubts and fears. He glanced 
uneasily across at Brownie, vague- 
ly wishing that someone else were 



with him. Brownie was a trouble- 
maker, Brownie talked too much, 
Brownie philosophized in a world 
that ridiculed philosophy. He’d 
known men like Brownie before, 
and he knew that they couldn’t be 
trusted. 

The gray hull gleamed at them 
as they moved toward it, a mon- 
strous wall of polished metal. 
There were no dents, no surface 
scars from its passage through 
space. They found the entrance 
lock without difficulty, near the top 
of the ship’s great hull, and 
Brownie probed the rim of the lock 
with a dozen instruments, his dark 
eyes burning eagerly. And then, 
with a squeal that grated in Sabo’s 
ears, the oval port of the ship quiv- 
ered, and slowly opened. 

Silently, the sleds moved into the 
opening. They were in a small 
vault, quite dark, and the sleds set- 
tled slowly onto a metal deck. Sabo 
eased himself from the seat, tuning 
up his audios to their highest sensi- 
tivity, moving over to Brownie. 
Momentarily they touched helmets, 
and Brownie’s excited voice came 
to him, muted, but breathless. “No 
trouble getting it open. It worked 
on the same principle as ours.” 

“Better get to work on the inner 
lock.” 

Brownie shot him a sharp glance. 
“But what about — inside? I mean, 
we can’t just walk in on them — ” 

“Why not? We’ve tried to con- 
tact them.” 

Reluctantly, the little engineer 
began probing the inner lock with 
trembling fingers. Minutes later 
they were easing themselves 
through, moving slowly down the 
dark corridor, waiting with pound-

ing hearts for a sound, a sign. The 
corridor joined another, and then 
still another, until they reached a 
great oval door. And then they 
were inside, in the heart of the 
ship, and their eyes widened as 
they stared at the thing in the cen- 
ter of the great vaulted chamber. 

“My God!” Brownie’s voice was 
a hoarse whisper in the stillness. 
“Look at them, Johnny!” 

Sabo moved slowly across the 
room toward the frail, crushed 
form lying against the great, 
gleaming panel. Thin, almost bone- 
less arms were pasted against the 
hard metal; an oval, humanoid 
skull was crushed like an eggshell 
into the knobs and levers of the 
control panel. Sudden horror shot 
through the big man as he looked 
around. At the far side of the room 
was another of the things, and still 
another, mashed, like lifeless jelly, 
into the floors and panels. Gently 
he peeled a bit of jelly away from 
the metal, then turned with a mix- 
ture of wonder and disgust. “All 
dead,” he muttered. 

Brownie looked up at him, his 
hands trembling. “No wonder 
there was no sign.” He looked 
about helplessly. “It’s a derelict, 
Johnny. A wanderer. How could it 
have happened? How long ago?” 
Sabo shook his head, bewildered. 
“Then it was just chance that it 
came to us, that we saw it — ” 

“No pilot, no charts. It might 
have wandered for centuries.” 
Brownie stared about the room, a 
frightened look on his face. And 
then he was leaning over the con- 
trol panel, probing at the array of 
levers, his fingers working eagerly 
at the wiring. Sabo nodded ap- 



provingly. “We’ll have to go over it 
with a comb,” he said. “I’ll see 
what I can find in the rest of the 
ship. You go ahead on the controls 
and drive.” Without waiting for 
an answer he moved swiftly from 
the round chamber, out into the 
corridor again, his stomach almost 
sick. 

It took them many hours. They 
moved silently, as if even a slight 
sound might disturb the sleeping 
alien forms, smashed against the 
dark metal panels. In another 
room were the charts, great, beau- 
tiful charts, totally unfamiliar, 
studded with star formations he 
had never seen, noted with curious, 
meaningless symbols. As Sabo 
worked he heard Brownie moving 
down into the depths of the ship, 
toward the giant engine rooms. 
And then, some silent alarm clicked 
into place in Sabo’s mind, tighten- 
ing his stomach, screaming to be 
heard. Heart pounding, he dashed 
down the corridor like a cat, seeing 
again in his mind the bright, eager 
eyes of the engineer. Suddenly the 
meaning of that eagerness dawned 
on him. He scampered down a lad- 
der, along a corridor, and down 
another ladder, down to the engine 
room, almost colliding with 
Brownie as he crossed from one of 
the engines to a battery of gener- 
ators on the far side of the room. 

“Brownie!” 

“What’s the trouble?” 

Sabo trembled, then turned 
away. “Nothing,” he muttered. 
“Just a thought.” But he watched 
as the little man snaked into the 
labyrinth of dynamos and coils and 
wires, peering eagerly, probing, 
searching, making notes in the lit- 




derelict

tie pad in his hand. 

Finally, hours later, they moved 
again toward the lock where they 
had left their sleds. Not a word 
passed between them. The uneasi- 
ness was strong in Sabo’s mind 
now, growing deeper, mingling 
with fear and a premonition of im- 
pending evil. A dead ship, a dere- 
lict, come to them by merest 
chance from some unthinkably re- 
mote star. He cursed, without 
knowing why, and suddenly he felt 
he hated Brownie as much as he 
hated the captain waiting for them 
in the Station. 

But as he stepped into the Sta- 
tion’s lock, a new thought crossed 
his mind, almost dazzling him with 
its unexpectedness. He looked at 
the engineer’s thin face, and his 



hands were trembling as he opened 
the pressure suit. 



E DELIBERATELY took 
longer than was necessary to 
give his report to the captain, dwell- 
ing on unimportant details, watch- 
ing with malicious amusement the 
captain’s growing annoyance. Cap- 
tain Loomis’ eyes kept sliding to 
Brownie, as though trying to read 
the information he wanted from 
the engineer’s face. Sabo rolled up 
the charts slowly, stowing them in 
a pile on the desk. ‘That’s the pic- 
ture, sir. Perhaps a qualified as- 
tronomer could make something of 
it; I haven’t the knowledge or the 
instruments. The ship came from 
outside the system, beyond doubt. 




84 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



Probably from a planet with light- 
er gravity than our own, judging 
from the frailty of the creatures. 
Oxygen breathers, from the looks 
of their gas storage. If you ask me, 
I’d say—” 

“All right, all right,” the captain 
breathed impatiently. “You can 
write it up and hand it to me. It 
isn’t really important where they 
came from, or whether they breathe 
oxygen or fluorine.” He turned his 
eyes to the engineer, and lit a cigar 
with trembling fingers.” The im- 
portant thing is how they got here. 
The drive, Brownie. You went over 
the engines carefully? What did 
you find?” 

Brownie twitched uneasily, and 
looked at the floor. “Oh, yes, I ex- 
amined them carefully. Wasn’t too 
hard. I examined every piece of 
drive machinery on the ship, from 
stem to stem.” 

Sabo nodded, slowly, watching 
the little man with carefully blank 
face. “That’s right. You gave it a 
good going over.” 

Brownie licked his lips. “It’s a 
derelict, like Johnny told you. 
They were dead. All of them. 
Probably had been dead for a long 
time. I couldn’t tell, of course. 
Probably nobody could tell. But 
they must have been dead for cen- 
turies — ” 

The captain’s eyes blinked as the 
implication sank in. “Wait a min- 
ute,” he said. “What do you mean, 
centuries?” 

Browrfie stared at his shoes. 
“The atomic piles were almost 
dead,” he muttered in an apolo- 
getic whine. “The ship wasn’t go- 
ing any place, captain. It was just 
wandering. Maybe it’s wandered 



for thousands of years.” He took a 
deep breath, and his eyes met the 
captain’s for a brief agonized mo- 
ment. “They don’t have Interstel- 
lar, sir. Just plain, simple, slow 
atomics. Nothing different. They’ve 
been traveling for centuries, and it 
would have taken them just as long 
to get back. 

The captain’s voice was thin, 
choked. “Are you trying to tell me 
that their drive is no different from 
our own? That a ship has actually 
wandered into Interstellar space 
without a space drive?” 

Brownie spread his hands help- 
lessly. “Something must have gone 
wrong. They must have started off 
for another planet in their own 
system, and something went wrong. 
They broke into space, and they 
all died. And the ship just went on 
moving. They never intended an 
Interstellar hop. They couldn’t 
have. They didn’t have the drive 
for it.” 

The captain sat back numbly, 
his face pasty gray. The light had 
faded in his eyes now; he sat as 
though he’d been struck. “You — 
you couldn’t be wrong? You 
couldn’t have missed anything?” 

Brownie’s eyes shifted unhappily, 
and his voice was very faint. “No, 

•_ jj 

sir. 

The captain stared at them for a 
long moment, like a stricken child. 
Slowly he picked up one of the 
charts, his mouth working. Then, 
with a bitter roar, he threw it in 
Sabo’s face. “Get out of here! Take 
this garbage and get out! And get 
the men to their stations. We’re 
here to watch Saturn, and by god, 
we’ll watch Saturn!” He turned 
away, a hand over his eyes, and

they heard his choking breath as 
they left the cabin. 

Slowly, Brownie walked out into 
the corridor, started down toward 
his cabin, with Sabo silent at his 
heels. He looked up once at the 
mate’s heavy face, a look of plead- 
ing in his dark brown eyes, and 
then opened the door to his quar- 
ters. Like a cat, Sabo was in the 
room before him, dragging him in, 
slamming the door. He caught the 
little man by the neck with one 
savage hand, and shoved him un- 
ceremoniously against the door, his 
voice a vicious whisper. “All right , 
talk! Let’s have it now!” 

Brownie choked, his eyes bulg- 
ing, his face turning gray in the 
dim light of the cabin. “Johnny! 
Let me down! What’s the matter? 
You’re choking me, Johnny — ” 

The mate’s eyes were red, with 
heavy lines of disgust and bitter- 
ness running from his eyes and the 
corners of his mouth. “You stink- 
ing little liar! Talk, damn it! 
You’re not messing with the cap- 
tain now, you’re messing with me, 
and I’ll have the truth if I have to 
cave in your skull — ” 

“I told you the truth! I don’t 
know what you mean — ” 

Sabo’s palm smashed into his 
face, jerking his head about like an 
apple on a string. “That’s the 
wrong answer,” he grated. “I warn 
you, don’t lie! The captain is an 
ambitious ass, he couldn’t think his 
way through a multiplication table. 
He’s a little child. But I’m not 
quite so dull.” He threw the little 
man down in a heap, his eyes blaz- 
ing. “You silly fool, your story is 
so full of holes you could drive a 
tank through it. They just up and 



died, did they? I’m supposed to be- 
lieve that? Smashed up against the 
panels the way they were? Only 
one thing could crush them like 
that. Any fool could see it. Accel- 
eration. And I don’t mean atomic 
acceleration. Something else.” He 
glared down at the man quivering 
on the floor. “They had Interstel- 
lar drive, didn’t they, Brownie?” 

Brownie nodded his head, weak- 
ly, almost sobbing, trying to pull 
himself erect. “Don’t tell the cap- 
tain,” he sobbed. “Oh, Johnny, for 
god’s sake, listen to me, don’t let 
him know I lied. I was going to tell 
you anyway, Johnny, really I was. 
I’ve got a plan, a good plan, can’t 
you see it?” The gleam of excite- 
ment came back into the sharp lit- 
tle eyes. “They had it, all right. 
Their trip probably took just a few 
months. They had a drive I’ve 
never seen before, non-atomic. I 
couldn’t tell the principle, with the 
look I had, but I think I could 
work it.” He sat up, his whole body 
trembling. “Don’t give me away, 
Johnny, listen a minute — ” 

Sabo sat back against the bunk, 
staring at the little man. “You’re 
out of your mind,” he said softly. 
“You don’t know what you’re do- 
ing. What are you going to do 
when his Nibs goes over for a look 
himself? He’s stupid, but not that 
stupid.” 

Brownie’s voice choked, his 
words tumbling over each other in 
his eagerness. “He won’t get a 
chance to see it, Johnny. He’s got 
to take our word until he sees it, 
and we can stall him — ” 

Sabo blinked. “A day or so — 
maybe. But what then? Oh, how 
could you be so stupid? He’s on the 




86 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



skids, he’s out of favor and fighting 
for his life. That drive is the break 
that could put him on top. Can’t 
you see he’s selfish? He has to be, 
in this world, to get anything. Any- 
thing or anyone who blocks him, 
he’ll destroy, if he can. Can’t you 
see that? When he spots this, your 
life won’t be worth spitting at.” 
Brownie was trembling as he sat 
down opposite the big man. His 
voice was harsh in the little cubicle, 
heavy with pain and hopelessness. 
“That’s right,” he said. “My life 
isn’t worth a nickle. Neither is 
yours. Neither is anybody’s, here or 
back home. Nobody’s life is worth 
a nickle. Something’s happened to 
us in the past hundred years, John- 
ny — something horrible. I’ve seen 
it creeping and growing up around 
us all my life. People don’t matter 
any more, it’s the Government, 
what the Government thinks that 
matters. It’s a web, a cancer that 
grows in its own pattern, until it 
goes so far it can’t be stopped. Men 
like Loomis could see the pattern, 
and adapt to it, throw away all the 
worthwhile things, the love and 
beauty and peace that we once had 
in our lives. Those men can get 
somewhere, they can turn this life 
into a climbing game, waiting their 
chance to get a little farther to- 
ward the top, a little closer to some 
semblance of security — ” 

“Everybody adapts to it,” Sabo 
snapped. “They have to. You don’t 
see me moving for anyone else, do 
you? I’m for me, and believe me I 
know it. I don’t give a hang for 
you, or Loomis, or anyone else 
alive — just me. I want to stay alive, 
that’s all. You’re a dreamer, 
Brownie. But until you pull some- 



thing like this, you can learn to 
stop dreaming if you want to — ” 

“No, no, you’re wrong — oh, 
you’re horribly wrong, Tohnny. 
Some of us can't adapt, we haven’t 
got what it takes, or else we have 
something else in us that won’t let 
us go along. And right there we’re 
beat before we start. There’s no 
place for us now, and there never 
will be.” He looked up at the 
mate’s impassive face. “We’re in a 
life where we don’t belong, im- 
pounded into a senseless, never- 
ending series of fights and skir- 
mishes and long, lonely waits, feed- 
ing this insane urge of the Govern- 
ment to expand, out to the planets, 
to the stars, farther and farther, 
bigger and bigger. We’ve got to go, 
seeking newer and greater worlds 
to conquer, with nothing to con- 
quer them with, and nothing to 
conquer them for. There’s life 
somewhere else in our solar system, 
so it must be sought out and con- 
quered, no matter what or where it 
is. We live in a world of iron and 
fear, and there was no place for 
me, and others like me, until this 
ship came — ” 

Sabo looked at him strangely. 
“So I was right. I read it on your 
face when we were searching the 
ship. I knew what you were think- 
ing . .” His face darkened angrily. 
“You couldn’t get away with it, 
Brownie. Where could you go, 
what could you expect to find? 
You’re talking death, Brownie. 
Nothing else — ” 

“No, no. Listen, Johnny.” 
Brownie leaned closer, his eyes 
bright and intent on the man’s 
heavy face. “The captain has to 
take our word for it, until he sees 




derelict 



87 



the ship. Even then he couldn’t tell 
for sure — I’m the only drive en- 
gineer on the Station. We have the 
charts, we could work with them, 
try to find out where the ship came 
from; I already have an idea of 
how the drive is operated. Another 
look and I could make it work. 
Think of it, Johnny! What differ- 
ence does it make where we went, 
or what we found? You’re a misfit, 
too, you know that — this coarseness 
and bitterness is a shell, if you 
could only see it, a sham. You 
don’t really believe in this world 
we’re in — who cares where, if only 
we could go, get away? Oh, it’s a 
chance, the wildest, freak chance, 
but we could take it — ” 

“If only to get away from him ,” 
said Sabo in a muted voice. “Lord, 
how I hate him. I’ve seen small- 
ness and ambition before — petti- 
ness and treachery, plenty of it. 
But that man is our whole world 
knotted up in one little ball. I don’t 
think I’d get home without killing 
him, just to stop that voice from 
talking, just to see fear cross his 
face one time. But if we took the 
ship, it would break him for good.” 
A new light appeared in the big 
man’s eyes. “He’d be through, 
Brownie. Washed up.” 

“And we’d be free — ” 

Sabo’s eyes were sharp. “What 
about the acceleration? It killed 
those that came in the ship.” 

“But they were so frail, so weak. 
Light brittle bones and soft jelly. 
Our bodies are stronger, we could 
stand it.” 

Sabo sat for a long time, staring 
at Brownie. His mind was suddenly 
confused by the scope of the idea, 
racing in myriad twirling fantasies, 



parading before his eyes the long, 
bitter, frustrating years, the hope- 
lessness of his own life, the dull 
aching feeling he felt deep in his 
stomach and bones each time he 
set back down on Earth, to join the 
teeming throngs of hungry people. 
He thought of the rows of drab 
apartments, the thin faces, the hol- 
low, hunted eyes of the people he 
had seen. He knew that that was 
why he was a soldier — because sol- 
diers ate well, they had time to 
sleep, they were never allowed long 
hours to think, and wonder, and 
grow dull and empty. But he knew 
his life had been barren. The life of 
a mindless automaton, moving 
from place to place, never think- 
ing, never daring to think or speak, 
hoping only to work without pain 
each day, and sleep without night- 
mares. 

And then, he thought of the 
nights in his childhood, when he 
had lain awake, sweating with fear, 
as the airships screamed across the 
dark sky above, bound he never 
knew where; and then, hearing in 
the far distance the booming ex- 
plosion, he had played that horri- 
ble little game with himself, seeing 
how high he could count before he 
heard the weary, plodding footsteps 
of the people on the road, moving 
on to another place. He had 
known, even as a little boy, that the 
only safe place was in those bomb- 
ers, that the place for survival was 
in the striking armies, and his life 
had followed the hard-learned pat- 
tern, twisting him into the cynical 
mold of the mercenary soldier, 
dulling the quick and clever mind, 
drilling into him the ways and re- 
sponses of order and obey, strip-

ping him of his heritage of love 
and humanity. Others less thought- 
ful had been happier; they had 
succeeded in forgetting the life 
they had known before, they had 
been able to learn easily and well 
the lessons of the repudiation of 
the rights of men which had crept 
like a blight through the world. But 
Sabo, too, was a misfit, wrenched 
into a mold he could not fit. He 
had sensed it vaguely, never really 
knowing when or how he had built 
the shell of toughness and cynicism, 
but also sensing vaguely that it was 
built, and that in it he could hide, 
somehow, and laugh at himself, 
and his leaders, and the whole 
world through which he plodded. 
He had laughed, but there had 
been long nights, in the narrow 
darkness of spaceship bunks, when 
his mind pounded at the shell, 
screaming out in nightmare, and he 
had wondered if he had really lost 
his mind. 

His gray eyes narrowed as he 
looked at Brownie, and he felt his 
heart pounding in his chest, 
pounding with a fury that he could 
no longer deny. “It would have to 
be fast,” he said softly. “Like light- 
ning, tonight, tomorrow — very 
soon.” 

“Oh, yes, I know that. But we 
can do it — ” 

“Yes,” said Sabo, with a hard, 
bitter glint in his eyes. “Maybe we 
can.” 



T HE PREPARATION was 

tense. For the first time in his 
life, Sabo knew the meaning of real 
fear, felt the clinging aura of sud- 
den death in every glance, every 



word of the men around him. It 
seemed incredible that the captain 
didn’t notice the brief exchanges 
with the little engineer, or his own 
sudden appearances and disap- 
pearances about the Station. But 
the captain sat in his cabin with 
angry eyes, snapping answers with- 
out even looking up. Still, Sabo 
knew that the seeds of suspicion lay 
planted in his mind, ready to burst 
forth with awful violence at any 
slight provocation. As he worked, 
the escape assumed greater and 
greater proportions in Sabo’s 
mind; he knew with increasing ur- 
gency and daring that nothing 
must stop him. The ship was there, 
the only bridge away from a life he 
could no longer endure, and his 
determination blinded him to cau- 
tion. 

Primarily, he pondered over the 
charts, while Brownie, growing 
hourly more nervous, poured his 
heart into a study of his notes and 
sketches. A second look at the en- 
gines was essential; the excuse he 
concocted for returning to the ship 
was recklessly slender, and Sabo 
spent a grueling five minutes dis- 
suading the captain from accom- 
panying him. But the captain’s eyes 
were dull, and he walked his cabin, 
sunk in a gloomy, remorseful 
trance. 

The hours passed, and the men 
saw, in despair, that more precious, 
dangerous hours would be neces- 
sary before the flight could be at- 
tempted. And then, abruptly, Sabo 
got the call to the captain’s cabin. 
He found the old man at his desk, 
regarding him with cold eyes, and 
his heart sank. The captain mo- 
tioned him to a seat, and then sat 




derelict

back, lighting a cigar with painful 
slowness. “I want you to tell me,” 
he said in a lifeless voice, “exactly 
what Brownie thinks he’s doing.” 
Sabo went cold. Carefully he 
kept his eyes on the captain’s face. 
“I guess he’s nervous,” he said. 
“He doesn’t belong on a Satellite 
Station. He belongs at home. The 
place gets on his nerves.” 

“I didn’t like his report.” 

“I know,” said Sabo. 

The captain’s eyes narrowed. “It 
was hard to believe. Ships don’t 
just happen out of space. They 
don’t wander out interstellar by 
accident, either.” An unpleasant 
smile curled his lips. “I’m not tell- 
ing you anything new. I wouldn’t 
want to accuse Brownie of lying, of 
course— or you either. But we’ll 
know soon. A patrol craft will be 
here from the Triton supply base 
in an hour. I signalled as soon as I 
had your reports.” The smile 
broadened maliciously. “The pa- 
trol craft will have experts aboard. 
Space drive experts. They’ll review 
your report.” 

“An hour — ” 

The captain smiled. “That’s 
what I said. In that hour, you 
could tell me the truth. I’m not a 
drive man, I’m an administrator, 
and organizer and director. You’re 
the technicians. The truth now 
could save you much unhappiness 
— in the future.” 

Sabo stood up heavily. “You’ve 
got your information,” he said with 
a bitter laugh. “The patrol craft 
will confirm it.” 

The captain’s face went a shade 
greyer. “All right,” he said. “Go 
ahead, laugh. I told you, anyway.” 
Sabo didn’t realize how his 



hands were trembling until he 
reached the end of the corridor. In 
despair he saw the plan crumbling 
beneath his feet, and with the des- 
pair came the cold undercurrent 
of fear. The patrol would discover 
them, disclose the hoax. There was 
no choice left — ready or not, they’d 
have to leave. 

Quickly he turned in to the cen- 
tral control room where Brownie 
was working. He sat down, repeat- 
ing the captain’s news in a soft 
voice. 

“An hour! But how can we — ” 
“We’ve got to. We can’t quit 
now, we’re dead if we do.” 

Brownie’s eyes were wide with 
fear. “But can’t we stall them, 
somehow? Maybe if we turned on 
the captain — ” 

“The crew would back him. 
They wouldn’t dare go along with 
us. We’ve got to run, nothing else.” 
He took a deep breath. “Can you 
control the drive?” 

Brownie stared at his hands. “I 
— I think so. I can only try.” 
“You’ve got to. It’s now or nev- 
er. Get down to the lock, and I’ll 
get the charts. Get the sleds ready.” 
He scooped the charts from his 
bunk, folded them carefully and 
bound them swiftly with cord. 
Then he ran silently down the cor- 
ridor to the landing port lock. 
Brownie was already there, in the 
darkness, closing the last clamps on 
his pressure suit. Sabo handed him 
the charts, and began the laborious 
task of climbing into his own suit, 
panting in the darkness. 

And then the alarm was clang- 
ing in his ear, and the lock was 
flooded with brilliant light. Sabo 
stopped short, a cry on his lips, 




90 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



staring at the entrance to the con- 
trol room. 

The captain was grinning, a 
nasty, evil grin, his eyes hard and 
humorless as he stood there flanked 
by three crewmen. His hand 
gripped an ugly power gun tightly. 
He just stood there, grinning, and 
his voice was like fire in Sabo’s 
ears. “Too bad,” he said softly. 
“You almost made it, too. Trouble 
is, two can’t keep a secret. Shame, 
Johnny, a smart fellow like you. I 
might have expected as much from 
Brownie, but I thought you had 
more sense — ” 

Something snapped in Sabo’s 
mind, then. With a roar, he lunged 
at the captain’s feet, screaming his 
bitterness and rage and frustration, 
catching the old man’s calves with 
his powerful shoulders. The captain 
toppled, and Sabo was fighting for 
the power gun, straining with all 
his might to twist the gun from the 
thin hand, and he heard his voice 
shouting, “Run! Go, Brownie , 
make it go!” 

The lock was open, and he saw 
Brownie’s sled nose out into the 
blackness. The captain choked, his 
face purple. “Get him! Don’t let 
him get away!” 

The lock clanged, and the 
screens showed the tiny fragile sled 
jet out from the side of the Station, 
the small huddled figure clinging 
to it, heading straight for the open 
port of the grey ship. “Stop him! 
The guns, you fools, the guns!” 

The alarm still clanged, and the 
control room was a flurry of ac- 
tivity. Three men snapped down 
behind the tracer-guns, firing with- 
out aiming, in a frenzied attempt 
to catch the fleeing sled. The sled 



began zig-zagging, twisting wildly 
as the shells popped on either side 
of it. The captain twisted away 
from Sabo’s grip with a roar, and 
threw one of the crewmen to the 
deck, wrenching the gun controls 
from his hands. “Get the big ones 
on the ship! Blast it! If it gets away 
you’ll all pay.” 

Suddenly the sled popped into 
the ship’s port, and the hatch slow- 
ly closed behind it. Raving, the 
captain turned the gun on the 
sleek, polished hull plates, pressed 
the firing levels on the war-head 
servos. Three of them shot out from 
the Satellite, like deadly bugs, ca- 
reening through the intervening 
space, until one of them struck the 
side of the gray ship, and exploded 
in purple fury against the imper- 
vious hull. And the others nosed 
into the flame, and passed on 
through, striking nothing. 

Like the blinking of a light, the 
alien ship had throbbed, and 
jerked, and was gone. 

With a roar the captain brought 
his fist down on the hard plastic 
and metal of the control panel, 
kicked at the sheet of knobs and 
levers with a heavy foot, his face 
purple with rage. His whole body 
shook as he turned on Sabo, his 
eyes wild. “You let him get away! 
It was your fault, yours! But you 
won’t get away! I’ve got you, and 
you’ll pay, do you hear that?” He 
pulled himself up until his face was 
bare inches from Sabo’s, his teeth 
bared in a frenzy of hatred. “Now 
we’ll see who’ll laugh, my friend. 
You’ll laugh in the death chamber, 
if you can still laugh by then!” He 
turned to the men around him. 
“Take him,” he snarled. “Lock him 




derelict 



91 



in his quarters, and guard him well. 
And while you’re doing it, take a 
good look at him. See how he 
laughs now.” 

They marched him down to his 
cabin, stunned, still wondering 
what had happened. Something 
had gone in his mind in that sec- 
ond, something that told him that 
the choice had to be made, instant- 
ly. Because he knew, with dull 
wonder, that in that instant when 
the lights went on he could have 
stopped Brownie, could have saved 
himself. He could have taken for 
himself a piece of the glory and 
promotion due to the discoverers of 
an Interstellar drive. But he had 
also known, somehow, in that short 
instant, that the only hope in the 
world lay in that one nervous, 
frightened man, and the ship 
which could take him away. 

And the ship was gone. That 
meant the captain was through. 



He’d had his chance, the ship’s 
coming had given him his chance, 
and he had muffed it. Now he, too, 
would pay. The Government 
would not be pleased that such a 
ship had leaked through his fingers. 
Captain Loomis was through. 

And him? Somehow, it didn’t 
seem to matter any more. He had 
made a stab at it, he had tried. He 
just hadn’t had the luck. But he 
knew there was more to that. 
Something in his mind was sing- 
ing, some deep feeling of happiness 
and hope had crept into his mind, 
and he couldn’t worry about him- 
self any more. There was nothing 
more for him; they had him cold. 
But deep in his mind he felt a cur- 
ious satisfaction, transcending any 
fear and bitterness. Deep in his 
heart, he knew that one man had 
escaped. 

And then he sat back and 
laughed. 



THE END 



PIPE OF PEACE 

(Continued from, page 43) 



And beside the farmhouse, on the 
ground, lay a pipe, its tobacco 
spilled, the last of its smoke swirl- 
ing out of its bowl into the air, dis- 
appearing. 

The woman sat in the kitchen of 
the farmhouse and turned her 
head when the door opened. She 
widened her eyes and caught at 
her throat with her hand. 

The sun through the doorway 
shone down on metallic hands and 



a metallic face, gleaming on the 
surface which the straw hat and 
the overalls and the blue shirt 
didn’t hide. The door snapped 
shut, and there was a sound of 
heavy metal footsteps against the 
kitchen floor. 

The woman pressed against her 
chair. “Who are you?” she 
screamed. 

“Henry,” said the mechanical 
thing. 



THE END 




Thorns, the vengeful, had determined his way. 
Aria, the healer, had determined her way. Which 
determined this classic meeting of the twain.

I T SEEMED they had argued 
for years as they were arguing 
tonight. The man paced back and 
forth chain-smoking cigarettes; the 
woman sat motionless, watching 
him. They glanced at their watches 
with fearful eyes. They heard, with 
acutely alert ears, the goings and 
comings of people in the hall ; 
heard the shattering blast of rock- 
ets in the sky above the city. And 
they argued. 

“So you’re going through with 
it tonight,” he said heavily, “in 
your own way.” 

“Yes.” 

“Perhaps I should stop you.” He 
crushed out his cigarette. “If the 
police were to hear — ” 

“No!” The word was thrown at 
him. “I know you don’t mean that. 
But it’s unworthy of you even to 
say it.” She covered her face with 



nervous hands. “After all I am 
your wife.” 

He stood over her, his lips tight. 
There was something of the fragile, 
finely made puppet about her, he 
thought, as though she had been 
refashioned a hundred times by 
some artisan seeking after perfect 
delicacy and precision. He softened 
momentarily. 

“Come with me then,” he said. 

“No.” 

“Why? Why?” 

“Your way is wrong” 

“We’re the last two leaders of 
the opposition alive.” His voice 
came swiftly and low. “The author- 
ity’s beaten us. Their setup for kill- 
ing, imprisonment, bribery and 
blackmail functions too well. Our 
whole organization’s been scattered 
like matchsticks. The police are 
closing in on us. We’re finished

here on earth. We’ll be lucky if 
we’re killed quickly.” He waited a 
moment for his words to take 
effect. “We go along together that 
far.” 

She stood, clasping her hands. 
“Of course. Of course.” 

“Look. I know you’ve finished 
that damned contraption of yours 
that’ll take you into the atoms. I 
know you’ve been working on it 
for years. But I’ve been working 
too. My ship’s been ready to take 
off into super-space for two days. 
But I haven’t gone. I’ve been wait- 
ing for you. To wait at a time like 
this is to ask for death or worse. 
Now I demand you give up this in- 
sane idea of going into the atoms. 
You’ve got to come with me.” 

“I’ve told you I can’t escape 
with you out into the macrocosm. 
It’s not my way ! 33 

“The word ‘escape’ doesn’t ap- 
ply,” he snapped, “to what I’m do- 
ing. You 3 re escaping. You’ll creep 
into the microcosm and sit there 
like a seed that won’t grow. You 
can’t fight the Authority from the 
microcosm. That way is utter pas- 
sivity and death. My way is fight- 
ing back. I’m going into hyper- 
space. My ship and I’ll become so 
huge and powerful I’ll throw suns 
around like snowballs. I’ll toss 
meteors around like grains of corn. 
I’ll upset gravities and warp time. 
I’ll stretch and straighten space. 
I’ll turn dimensions inside out — ” 

“Yes. You’ll destroy. You’ll ruin 
everything, you’ll break the inno- 
cent as well as the guilty.” 

“I’ll have to take that chance,” 
he said grimly. “But I’ll destroy the 
Authority and everything that goes 
with it.” 



She pulled from his grasp. “Vio- 
lence and destruction are not my 
way. They never have been.” 
Slowly now she sank into the chair, 
looked past him as she spoke. 
“You’ve always worshipped spaces 
and vacuums and voids. I’ve al- 
ways been happy working with 
flowers and trees, the life of the 
meadow and valley, the rain and 
the new, small buds in springtime. 
We have always gone in opposite 
directions.” 

She paused and smiled a bit 
wistfully. “It’s funny. Now we find, 
too late to help our marriage, that 
there’s a whole universe between 
us. You refuse, or perhaps you’re 
afraid, I don’t know, to go to the 
source of everything — this table, 
this chair, this gown, your own. 
flesh. You don’t want to under- 
stand life ; any more than you want 
to understand me. You must con- 
quer it — or destroy it. You must be 
a giant that can kick the earth 
around like a football. But I do 
want to understand, for in under- 
standing lies the cure. My machine 
will take me into the atoms. I’ll be- 
come part of the fabric and tapes- 
try of the very warp and woof of 
our world. By becoming a part of 
it, I will know. I’ll find the secret 
of life in inner space and I’ll return 
and release our people from the 
Authority. And you? You’ll never 
really understand anything. You’ll 
be a wild comet, yes, but I’ll be a 
raindrop in a deep well, learning 
patience. I’ll be a true healer.” 

For a moment sadness rose and 
softened his face. “There’s nothing 
more to say, is there.” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“We’ll make the goodbys quick.”

He came to her. “At least we’re be- 
ing honest with each other. No lies. 
No pettiness. We’ve developed 
pretty powerful ideals. And they 
just won’t fit together. It’s that 
simple — and that good.” 

She looked up at him and 
smiled. “At least I haven’t lost you 
to another woman.” 

He returned her smile. “We’re 
getting sentimental. This isn’t 
good. It’s weakening.” He bent 
and lightly kissed her hair. For an 
instant her breathing stopped. 
“Goodby.” 

“Goodby,” she whispered. 

He strode to the door and 
opened it. His body snapped taut. 

C ONFRONTING him with a 
drawn blaster, stood a man in 
the shining red garb of the police 
command. He resembled Mephisto 
with his flowing cape and snug 
trousers. His face was dark, his 
nose thin, his eyes black and very 
bright. 

“You seem surprised,” said the 
man in red. 

Aria had half risen from the 
chair.. As the eyes of the policeman 
turned on her, she sank back. 

“How opportune,” the police- 
man continued. “The eve of your 
departures.” The smile set on his 
mouth. His gun snapped up on a 
line with Thorus’ heart. “No sud- 
den moves, or you’ll be burnt to a 
cinder. But no. That’s what you 
want — a quick death. So let me 
threaten you with merely burning 
your legs off.” The blaster lowered. 
“It may interest you to know we 
have a recording of your whole 



conversation. But there’s something 
else.” 

His eyes holding Thorus, he 
gave a sharp command to two 
burly, bullnecked policemen. They 
stepped from the shadows and 
stood behind the commander. One 
held a small, black box. 

“I see,” the commander said, 
“You’ve had experience before 
with the truth clamps. You’re 
frightened.” 

Thorus motioned the command- 
er inside. “A little fear trickles 
through my hate.” 

The door swung shut behind the 
three policemen. Thorus glanced at 
Aria. Her fingers clutched the 
arms of the chair. He knew she 
was thinking of the blocks that had 
recently been installed in their 
minds by X-ray hypnosis. Would 
the blocks hold after three days? 
Three days, they both knew was 
the limit. 

“It’s your methods of escape we 
must have,” said the commander. 
He motioned to one of the police- 
men. 

Thorus watched the man step in 
front of him and raise the clamps 
to his forehead. He saw features 
that were thick and heavy, as 
though they had been roughly 
moulded out of too wet clay. 

“You can see,” the commander 
went on, “the tremendous advan- 
tage to us of being able to go into 
the macrocosm and toss meteors 
around like bits of com, as you 
say.” He glanced at Aria, who sat 
huddled in the chair, like a porce- 
lain doll. “And then into the mi- 
crocosm. Unlimited power. A 
whole new universe to conquer and 
colonize. 




96 



RICHARD E. STOCKHAM 



Aria did not move or speak. 

“I see she refuses to face reali- 
ty.” He turned to Thorns. “But 
you will face reality — and so will 
she when we’ve finished. Had you 
conducted your experiments in be- 
half of the Authority, you would 
have been well rewarded. But no, 
you have been working against us 
— however, it has been for the Au- 
thority after all.” 

Thorus felt the clamps tight on 
his temples, like two steel fingers. 
Sitting stiffly on a chair, he felt 
sweat on his back and chest, felt it 
seep from his forehead down into 
his eyes, felt the bum of salt. There 
was tightness all through him as he 
waited for the first shock. His fin- 
gernails cut his palms. His breath 
stopped. His shoulders and arms 
hardened, stretched tight his tunic. 

The commander flicked his 
finger at the one kneeling before 
the little black box. This one 
tripped a lever. A soft hum seemed 
to rise from the box and fill the 
room. 

Thorus listened to the hum grow 
until it was a soft, high pitched 
scream. He closed his eyes. The 
next instant a shattering blow 
ripped through every inch of his 
body. Fire ran along his nerves. He 
felt his lips grimacing away from 
his teeth, felt the comers of his 
mouth stretching back to his ears. 
Oh God, oh God, he cried out in 
silent agony. Hold back my 
screams. Then he heard himself 
groan. He cut off the sound of it. 
Choked. Heard a growl deep in his 
chest. Lights flashed in his eyes 
and there was a tearing apart 
through his whole body. A squeez- 
ing together rushed all around him 



and an insane pounding and pull- 
ing as though his flesh were being 
beaten and clawed from his bones. 
Time dropped away from him un- 
til it seemed he had never been 
aware of anything but this agony. 
Then he was empty of sensation. 
He felt himself fall forward, felt 
heavy hands catch him roughly 
and set him upright. The soft voice 
of the commander flowed into his 
mind like a voice from outer 
space: 

“You will tell us your method of 
going into the macrocosm. The 
equations, the type ship, its propel- 
lent, where the ship is hidden. 

Thorus felt enveloped in a void. 

The voice of the commander 
droned on. “All we need is a clue. 
We’ll work out the rest.” 

Life and feeling and thought 
were surging back into Thoms 
now. Strength filled his muscles 
again. Sight came into his eyes. 
Again he sat straight and stiff on 
the chair. The block held, he 
thought. It held and they cannot 
know now!” 

“Speak!” The commander’s 
voice rose. “Damn you!” He seized 
Thorus by the hair. “You’ve 
blocked off the information. I’ll see 
both of you tortured until you’ll 
wish to kill each other. Then we’ll 
try the clamps again. He smashed 
his fist into Thoms’ face. 

On the instant the commander 
pulled back his fist, Thoms 
reached out and jerked the blaster 
from his belt. His foot came up 
hard against the man’s groin. 
There was a grunting cry of pain. 
Thorus fell backward off the stool, 
pressing the blaster trigger as he 
hit the floor. He saw blood gush

from the commander’s middle, saw 
him pitch sideways, like a broken 
statue, heard Aria’s scream. The 
clamps pulled from his head. He 
swung the gun’s muzzle to the two 
policemen, clawing at their hol- 
sters. The blaster struck out, a long 
coughing hiss, a spray of flame. 
There were cries and gasps and 
jerking and clutching and the 
scrambling fall of the two bodies. 

Then silence. 

Thorus crawled unsteadily to his 
feet, stood swaying. The gun hung 
loosely in his hand. Now he felt 
Aria close to him, heard her voice 
trembling and breathy. 

“Thorus! Are you all right?” 

“Yes.” 

“The blocks held! They held!” 

Steadying himself, he saw Aria 
glance at the bodies on the floor. 

“Destruction!” she shuddered. 
“Nothing but destruction. Oh God, 
I’m sick of it!” 

Thorus let the gun drop to the 
floor. “There’s no time to talk. 
Your laboratory.” He grasped her 
by the shoulders and turned her 
toward a bright steel door across 
the room. “ You’ll save time to go 
into your damned microcosm. 
You'll make it. Good luck. If I 
have any luck at all, I’ll make it 
too.” He gave her a push. Without 
speaking or turning back, she 
moved across the room, as though 
sleep walking.. The gleaming door 
slab slid back as she approached it, 
closed behind her. 

The memory of her face stayed 
in his mind for a long moment aft- 
er she had disappeared, and from 
the room’s atmosphere he seemed 
to breathe in regret and a sense of 
their failure. He turned abruptly, 



looked down at each crumpled 
body. Opening the door a crack, he 
searched the brightly lighted street 
for the figure of a policeman, saw 
none, stepped outside and ran. 

I N HER laboratory, Aria worked 
deftly, swiftly at the transparent 
body-length cylinder. She checked 
wire connections, dials, buttons, 
then opened one end of the tube, 
lowered herself into place, when 
she had closed the tube, she lay 
still, the forefinger of her right 
hand resting on a button. 

During all these preparations, 
she was viewing, with her inner 
sight, Thorus’ tiny ship streaking 
through the night toward a distant 
mountain peak where a small met- 
al ball, large enough for one man, 
sat shrouded by a screen of invisi- 
bility. Now she saw the streak of 
flame die in the night and the tiny 
ship sitting motionless beside the 
metal ball; saw Thorus open a 
hatch in the ball’s side, let himself 
through the opening and swing 
shut the circle of steel. 

“Thank God,” she said. “What- 
ever comes now, at least he’s made 
it.” 

Wiping away the vision of him, 
she hesitated a moment, said good- 
by to earth and life as she’d 
known it and would never know it 
again. A moment of yearning for 
a chance to live safely and well as 
a wife and mother swept her with 
sadness. The yearning held her fin- 
ger from the button; a final hug- 
ging of human love and full human 
life, a last lonely cry for earth as 
she had known it in childhood 
with the press of wind and the 




98 



RICHARD E. STOCKHAM 



touch and sight of green growing 
things and the depth of blue above 
and the ground beneath. 

Feeling then as though she were 
plunging into midnight ocean 
depths, she thrust her finger hard 
against the button! 

Instantly light shimmered all 
about! 

The room dissolved. A sense of 
dreaming too vividly, yet of being 
deep in a sleep that was a thousand 
times more acutely awake than 
any awakeness she had ever known 
filled all her being. She felt herself 
sinking into a great bottomless 
depth and yet at the same time 
soaring through space to the ends 
of the universe, until both falling 
and soaring flowed into each other 
and became suspension. And then 
suddenly she saw all things as one. 
She saw the intricate design of a 
snowflake that was the snows of all 
the earth and a drop of water that 
held all the oceans. 

There was the rhythmic beating 
all around as though of a great, 
omnipresent heart and the surge 
and flow of oceans of lifeblood and 
the rise and fall of eternal breath- 
ing. A speck of soil was the soil of 
all the earth, from which grew for- 
ests and fields of green. She let her- 
self out into the space of all this 
and was merely there, like time is, 
where there is the motion and 
change of birth and death and 
birth again and death again. She 
felt a gentle touch on her body 
that was the body of all mankind 
and knew it for the touch of air, a 
single element of all earth’s winds 
that yet was all the clear winds of 
earth. 

The next moment a thundrous 



roar crashed like a tidal wave. She 
felt a gigantic shaking in all the 
snow and water, in the oceans and 
mountains, in the air and wind, in 
the blood and life and beating 
heart. A faltering of the rhythm 
and flow went, like a cosmic shud- 
der, through all this life and 
through her own being so that she 
was conscious of nausea and ache 
and a violent flinging about. 

She had a sense then of pulling 
within herself, like a sea anemone 
that has been touched by an en- 
emy. 

And in her silent voice, she cried 
out, “Thorns!” 

In the macrocosm. Thorus de- 
stroying! Destroying! The next in- 
stant her inner sight swung back 
to where Thoms’ ship, the shining 
metal ball, had leapt up off the 
mountain of earth; leapt, in the 
fraction of a second, through the 
blue earth covering into black, out- 
er space. Her inner sight saw the 
metal ball inflating, a cosmic ba- 
loon, flashing like the sun, then 
seeming to fill the space between 
all the suns! 



T HORUS, in his ship, was 
conscious of being a colossus 
that could step from planet to 
planet as though he were using 
them for stones to cross a pond of 
earth water. Step past the solar sys- 
tem, he thought, out into the uni- 
verse. Now the sun became a tiny 
ball of fire, a lightning bug, the 
earth a grain of dust. He could 
blow out the light of the sun, flick 
Earth and the other planets into 
nothingness. “I’ve broken through,” 
he thought. “I’ve done it! I’ve been

released.” And looking out and 
away, he saw universe upon uni- 
verse extending past infinity, it 
seemed, an ocean without a hori- 
zon. 

Now, said his thought, I will de- 
stroy all evil and I shall begin with 
the evil of earth. As though he 
were looking through a microscope, 
he focused his sight on the grain of 
dust that was earth. His fingers 
made delicate adjustments on a 
dial, and earth, softly green and 
blue, swam clearly into his vision. 
He magnified his sight of earth un- 
til he could see all of it like a gi- 
gantic relief map. He saw the forti- 
fied places of the Authority — great, 
spreading, shining, metal domes; 
saw them dotting the earth; saw 
the lines of vehicles speeding back 
and forth between them. He saw 
too the hamlets of the people, in 
the spaces between the forts of the 
Authority, all places of squalor 
with row upon row of boxlike 
houses, each exactly like the other. 
There were not any green lawns or 
shade trees, only houses and streets 
and people moving about. 

Thorus felt his anger rise. He 
pressed a button that flung out 
fields of gravity. Earth rocked and 
heaved, like an animal in convul- 
sions. Volcanos exploded, shot out 
their flaming, poisonous refuse. 
Oceans were monsters writhing 
and rolling in their troughs, reach- 
ing onto the land, as though to pull 
it beneath them. And the land it- 
self split wide and snapped shut 
great, yawning jaws. There was a 
wild rushing about among all the 
people, a madness, as though fran- 
tic motion would save them. They 
looked up off the convulsed earth 



with panic stricken eyes, their 
voices raised in agony. 

Thorus’ voice sounded, “The 
time for the death of the Authority 
has come. I will crush them as 
though I were crushing snails. He 
reached out from the ship with 
rays that seized meteors and flung 
them like a schoolboy flinging 
stones at bottles, one by one against 
the massive, shining domes of the 
Authority. The domes cracked and 
split and were crushed. The atomic 
bombs broke open with flame that 
leapt up yellow tongues and grew 
mushrooms in the sky, and a burn- 
ing death spread all around. 

Then Thorus was quiet, watch- 
ing all that he had destroyed. 

But suddenly, he became aware 
of Aria’s thought within him, cry- 
ing out. “Destroyer! Murderer! In 
moments you’ve set humanity back 
a hundred thousand years. You’re 
worse than the Authority. There’ll 
never be any peace for you or for 
the earth or even the universe aft- 
er what you’ve done. Other Au- 
thorities will come and you’ll have 
to destroy them and others and 
others. Destruction for you forever, 
on and on, until you fill the uni- 
verse with it . .” 

In his mind, Thorus saw her 
among the falling snowflakes and 
the drops of cool water and the 
green, growing atoms; saw her in 
the transparent tube sink deeper 
and deeper into the microcosm, 
away and away like a minnow 
swimming down into a beautiful 
lake on a summer’s day. Deeper, 
ever deeper, until there was noth- 
ing but the blue, sleepy water. 

As Thorus looked upon the earth 
again and saw the terrible destruc- 




100 



RICHARD E. STOCKHAM 



tion he had wrought, he trembled. 
There was the realization in him 
that, beneath his consciousness, 
had lain the hope that, after he 
had wiped clean the earth, Aria’s 
healing power would remake it. 
But now there would be no heal- 
ing, and for thousands of years 
earth would lie a smoking ruins 
with the people crawling about its 
shattered surface like bugs. 

He turned from all he saw. He 
closed his eyes and threw his ship 
out into space, threw it away into 
the fathomless void. He must es- 
cape from the universe, must flee 
from the horror that filled him at 
the desolation he had wrought. 
Straight out into space, out into 
the forever, where earth would 
cease to exist, where he and his re- 
morse would be lost. 



G LEAMING suns and galaxies 
streaked past yet he seemed 
within himself to be hanging mo- 
tionless in an infinite sea of black- 
ness while he knew that the speed 
of him cracked through the barrier 
of time and space; knew that it 
was a speed beyond any conceived 
by the mind of man. On into for- 
getfulness, escape beyond his mem- 
ory, faster and farther away than 
his mind, so far away that even 
earth would disappear in his 
thought. 

As incredible distances stretched 
almost to breaking between him- 
self and earth, he thought : So this 
is the end. For all I’ve been and 
wanted to be, this is it. A nothing- 
ness beyond the universe. 

But as the last word went from 
his thought, he saw a greenish blue 



ball of light rush toward him. He 
watched it inflate in the port. It 
enveloped the whole ship. The suns 
and the galaxies had faded into 
nothingness. He was aware of sink- 
ing into eternal depths but at the 
same time he felt himself soaring 
until sinking and soaring flowed 
into each other. After a time, he 
saw shimmering white crystals en- 
circling his ship. And then the en- 
circling crystals became one snow- 
flake reflecting light like the moon. 

A great wonder filled him and 
he stared in overwhelming awe. He 
heard his own heartbeat in his 
body and outside the ship, holding 
the ship in an eternal throbbing; 
heard the flowing of his own blood 
like a turbulent river; heard his 
breathing become the ebb and flow 
of wind, like the sound of surf. His 
body too became the soil of earth 
and its rock and water and he was 
deeply conscious of growth all 
through him. He was birth and 
death and he was both in one and 
he was the life of mankind, of ani- 
mals, of plants. 

As he waited in what seemed to 
be eternity, sunlight broke into his 
sight and he saw a field of grass 
forming around his ship. Blue sky 
swam into focus above him. White 
cloud patches formed in the blue 
as though they had been ordered 
there by the word of creation. 
Thorns knew then that he was on 
earth again, that he had come up 
from deep inside it. 

Rising up, like one awakening 
uncertainly from sleep in a strange 
room, he opened the ship’s hatch 
and looked out upon the land. A 
flash of light caught his eyes then, 




CIRCLE OF FLIGHT 



101 



from above, and he looked *up in 
wonder. 

He gasped. 



A RIA, in the transparent cylin- 
der, sinking down through 
the blue, like a leaf, settling gently 
to the earth a hundred feet away. 

She crawled out and stood look- 
ing across the field of grass at him, 
a strange, smile on her face. 

Thoms leaped from his ship and 
ran toward her. He ran silently. 
She held out her hands and he 
grasped them tenderly, as he would 
grasp the hands of a child. And 
all he could say was, “Aria. Aria.” 
“Thoms,” she said, and there 
was courage and joy in her voice. 
“We’ve come back.” 

They stared into each other’s 
eyes for a long moment and then 
they were close, and they held to 
each other and swayed. 

“Do you know what’s hap- 
pened?” she said. 

“Yes. You came back through 
hyper-space while 1 came back 
through the atoms.” His voice was 
quiet. “Oh, Lord. Oh good and 
strange Lord. We forgot that one 
of the great men twenty thousand 
years ago, proved that space was 
curved.” 

“Yes.” She stood away from him 
now, yet held to his hand. “We 



couldn’t escape from our place in 
life or ourselves or the good and 
the evil that we have done. We 
came back to our earth and now 
we must do what we have left un- 
done.” 

There was much to be done. 

Thoms looked around. He saw 
in the distance a cmshed and 
smoking mins. “I’ve destroyed the 
Authority, but I’ve destroyed too 
much. Now the people are in 
chaos.” 

Aria stood silently awhile, and 
then moved his arm. “But now you 
can help me to heal them. You’ve 
seen in the microcosm, as I have in 
the macrocosm that all life is one. 
Now we can show the people that 
outer and inner space are not sep- 
arate. We can show them how they 
exist together and how there can 
be no escape in either or from 
either. It will take a long time. But 
we will do it. And the doing will 
be grand.” She paused. “The be- 
ginning and the end, Thorns. The 
greatness and the smallness. The 
light and the darkness. It’s all 
here.” 

“And all that’s in between. That 
too.” 

“Yes,” she answered quietly. 
“That too.” 

They turned to the smoking 
ruins and arm in arm began walk- 
ing toward it. 



THE END 




Twenty years is a long time to live in anticipation. 
At least , Professor Pettibone thought so — until the 
twenty years were up. 



Say "Hello" for Ale 

By FRANK W. COGGINS 



HIS WAS to be the day , but 
of course Professor Pettibone 
had no way of knowing it. He arose, 
as he had been doing for the pre- 
vious twenty years, donned the tat- 
tered remnants of his space suit, 
and went out into the open. He 
stood erect, bronzed, magnificent, 
faced distant Earth, and recited : 

“Good morning bright sunshine, 

We’re glad you are here. 

You make the world happy, 

And bring us good cheer.” 

It was something he had heard 
as a child and, isolated here on 
Mars, he had remembered it and 
used it to keep from losing his 
power of speech. 

The ritual finished, he walked 
to the edge of the nearest canal, 
and gathered a bushel or so of dried 
Martian moss. He returned and be- 
gan polishing the shiny exterior of 
the wrecked space ship. It had to 
really glitter if it was to be an effec- 
tive beacon in guiding the rescue 
ship. 

Professor Pettibone knew — had 



known for years — that a ship would 
come. It was just a matter of time, 
and as the years slipped by, his 
faith diminished not a whit. 

With his task half completed, he 
glanced up at the sun and quick- 
ened the polishing. It was a long 
walk to the place the berry bushes 
grew, and if he arrived too late, the 
sun would have dried out the 
night’s crop of fragile berrys and 
he would wait until the morrow for 
nourishment. 

But on this day, he was fated to 
arrive at the bush area not at all, 
because an alien sound from above 
again drew the Professor’s eyes 
from his work, and he knew that 
the day had arrived. 

The ship was three times as large 
as any he had ever visualized, and 
its futuristic design told him, 
sharply, how far he fallen behind 
in his dreaming. He smiled and 
said, quite calmly. “I daresay I am 
about to be rescued.” 

And he experienced a thrill as the 
great ship set down and two men 
emerged therefrom. A thrill tinged 
with a guilt-sense, because emo- 




102 




tional experiences were rare in an 
isolated life and seemed somehow 
indecent. 

The two men held weapons. 
They advanced upon Professor Pet- 
tibone, looked up into his face, re- 
flected a certain wary hostility. 
That the hostility was tinged with 
instinctive respect, even awe, made 
it no less potent. 

One of them asked. “Fella — 
man came in ship — sky boat — long 
time ago. Him dead? Where?” Ap- 
propriate gestures accompanied the 
words. 

Professor Pettibone smiled down 
at the little men and bowed. “You 
are of course referring to me. I 
came in the ship. I am Professor 
Pettibone. It was nice of you to 
hunt me up.” 

The eyes of the two Terran 
spacemen met and locked in star- 
tled inquiry. One of them voiced 
the reaction of both when he said, 
“What the hell—” 

“You no doubt are curious as to 
the fate of the other members of 
the expedition. They were killed, 
all save Fletcher, who lasted a 
week.” Professor Pettibone waved 
a hand. “There — in the grave- 
yard.” 

But their eyes remained on the 
only survivor of that ill-fated first 
expedition. It was hard to accept 
him as the man they sought, but, 
faced with undeniable similarity 
between what they expected and 
what they had found, the two 
spacemen had no alternative. 

“I hope your food supply is am- 
ple — and varied,” Professor Petti- 
bone said. 

This seemed to bring them out 
of their bemusement. “Of course, 



Professor. Would you care to come 
aboard?” 

The other made a try at con- 
genial levity. “You must be pretty 
hungry after twenty years.” 

“Really — has it been that long? I 
tried to keep track at first . .” 

“We can blast off anytime you 
say. You’re probably pretty anxious 
to get back.” 

“Indeed I am. The changes, in 
twenty years — must be breathtak- 
ing. I wonder if they’ll remember 
me?” 

A short time later, the Professor 
said, “It’s amazing. A ship of this 
size handled by only two men.” 
Then he sat down to a repast laid 
out by one of the awed spacemen. 

But, after nibbling a bit of this, 
a forkful of that, he found that 
satisfaction lay in the anticipation 
moreso than in the eating. 

“We’ll look around and see what 
we can find in the way of clothing 
for you, Professor,” one of the 
spacemen said. Then the man’s be- 
musement returned. His eyes trav- 
eled over the magnificent physique 
before him. The perfect giant of a 
man; the great, Apollo-like head 
with the calm, clear eyes; the ex- 
pression of complete contentment 
and serenity. 

The space man said, “Professor 
— to what do you attribute the 
changes in your body. What is there 
about this planet — ?” 

“I really don’t know.” Professor 
Pettibone looked down his torso 
with an impersonal eye. “I think 
the greenish skin pigmentation is 
a result of mineral-heavy vapors 
that occur during certain seasons. 
The growth. As to my body — I real-

This story concerns a contest, a contestant and a beautiful 
wife; also, perhaps, that ancient Biblical quotation that says

shall take thought for the things of itself”. 



The Contest 

By Gavin Hyde 

Illustrated by Orban 



C YL MAR walked toward the 
center of the city in the yellow 
early afternoon, increasingly an- 
noyed by the intrusion of unim- 
portant domestic memories that his 
mind relived, not without embar- 
rassment, and a sense of his own 
failing. Today, when he had turned 
to her at the door, he could have 
said, “Goodbye, I’ll see you in an 
hour or so.” There were many 
things he could have said which 
would have freed him from his con- 
science during his walk down. But 
he couldn’t. He tightened up and 
could say nothing of how he felt. 
For his mind was tense with the 
anticipated combat to soon take 
place in a cubicle behind the 
great hanging thought-transmission 
screen. The cubicle and thought- 
transmission screen had been in use 
continuously until yesterday, but 
now they were idle, along with the 



two TT machines, waiting for the 
last round in the contest. 

She should understand — on to- 
day, of all days! He never spoke to 
anyone before a match. Speech dis- 
turbed the strength and color of 
one’s thoughts because it was more 
difficult than thinking. It also in- 
volved the acceptance of another 
personality. 

In the contest, acceptance was a 
very bad thing. So was this memory 
analysis, Cyl thought. Asking him- 
self why he hadn’t spoken to his 
wife! This slipping back in the 
train of thought would never do in 
the contest. That was the theory of 
Jons, the foremost analyst of devel- 
opments, anyway. What was it he 
said in the Thought-Transmission 
Annual? “The contest consists of 
the conflict between two imagina- 
tions. Each must analyze the inter- 
est and logic of the other, trying to 



105 




106 



GAVIN HYDE 



possess the resultant theme through 
complex development of thought. 
The drive, the momentum of the 
imagination is the telling factor in 
the contest.” 

Cyl had studied that statement! 
It had been released by Jons after 
his tragic retirement. Like other 
philosophers who had dreamed of 
perpetual control and champion- 
ship, he had been eliminated soon 
after the birth of the contest — when 
the powerful and mercenary spon- 
sors moved in, bringing with them 
their strange assortment of thinkers. 

One year the contest was won by 
a barber who could maintain the 
most powerful (and infinitely bor- 
ing) thought train based on cur- 
rent events, suicides, wrecks, fili- 
busters, sports, and scandals. Rumor 
said that his simple training con- 
sisted of a glance at the morning 
paper. 

Then there was the fisherman 
who could turn from the most deli- 
cate winding of a gold silken thread 
on a trout fly to the baleful glare of 
a giant squid, almost, it seemed, 
“faster than the transmission of 
thought.” 

People had only heard about the 
new and exciting thought-trans- 
mission device when a last holdout 
of the decadent “Quiz” show M.C.’s 
decided it would be a good gag to 
get a married man from the audi- 
ence, put him on-stage with a beau- 
tiful girl, and telecast the inter- 
change of ideas. It was imperative 
his wife be in the audience. Oh, 
yes! That was half the fun, watch- 
ing her reaction to her husband’s 
futile attempt to avoid what might 
be called a public mental infidelity. 

Well, the booming growth of the 



contest was past, but even now Cyl 
never knew what to expect during 
the first rounds of elimination. 
Three months before this final day, 
Cyl had been faced with hopeful 
after hopeful, never knowing what 
sort of attack was coming with the 
sound of the buzzer. A roller-skater 
had thrown a scare into him with 
that infernal organ giving off its 
regular, unconquerable squeals, 
plus the sound of all the skates the 
pudgy boy could muster into his 
mind, rolling and rolling! 

Every time Cyl began to get the 
upper hand by, say, increasing the 
speed until it was impossible to im- 
agine that one was on skates and 
then switching to skis, or some- 
thing like that, the boy would pro- 
ject a sign saying ALL SKATERS 
or COUPLES ONLY and there 
Cyl would be, back in the rink. 

However, by a stroke of luck 
Cyl had broken his leg once in his 
amateurish attempts to go back- 
ward, and he was able to bring back 
the terrible ring of hot, over- sym- 
pathetic faces that immediately 
surrounded him. He just continued 
the idea of the injury, the ride in 
the copter-ambulance, the hospital, 
ether, blood. Rather a rude way to 
treat a child, but what was one to 
do? To Cyl this was a business. 
Children had to take their chances 
with the rest. 

Cyl remembered the semi-finals, 
and one of those people who con- 
tinually turned up at the contest, 
experts in a certain field, like glass- 
blowers, taxidermists, diamond 
cutters, even orchid fanciers. He 
almost paid dearly for his love of 
the strange, the beautiful. When 
the buzzer sounded he had found 




THE CONTEST 



107 



himself submerged in a light-green 
place, in a struggle with what 
seemed a tremendous piece of 
carved jade. It had four paddles 
sticking out which waved, pushed 
and scratched. In all his life his op- 
ponent had had but one job, that of 
removing tortoises from the can- 
neries’ holding-tanks by turning 
them on their backs. Cyl had di- 
minished the size of the shell, trans- 
forming it laboriously into a girl’s 
bathing suit. Then he had started 
at top and bottom developing her 
body, and had managed just in time 
to gain dominance. The judges’ de- 
cision had been long in coming even 
though they were experts at per- 
ceiving the telltale “unexpected 
metamorphosis of a thought”, as 
Jons called it. 

B UT NOW, on this day, there 
was only Cyl’s brain against one 
more. He looked at their pictures 
on the program. It was funny, those 
two heads, awkward-looking things, 
being capable of waging a battle 
against each other. Cyl knew what 
was in the head on the right. That 
was his. The other one was his op- 
ponent. He would have to be pow- 
erful to have come so far. 

Cyl, for his part, had worried 
about every opponent. He must 
have the sure sweep of dreams to 
hurl at his last adversary. He had 
to win for his wife. He kept telling 
himself it wasn’t prestige he was 
after. He had to do it for Lin, be- 
cause he felt he must somehow pay 
for the gulf that had widened be- 
tween them because of his preoc- 
cupation with the contest. He had 
practically stopped talking alto- 



gether! He loved her. He knew it 
as he watched her moving around 
the house. But he could not afford 
the distraction involved in giving 
her his love. There he was, night 
after night, his mind rising to a 
point of secure joy in having her 
and then receding into the prob- 
lems of the contest. Cyl knew that 
everything had to be sacrificed. 

A few weeks before, in a state of 
exasperation at the thought of fac- 
ing a chess champion, he had taken 
his chess pieces out to try to figure 
some way to foil his opponent. 
Chessplayers and scientists in spe- 
cialized fields had a quality called 
conformance. It helped them, but 
it was also a weakness. Every time 
these people won by the use of the 
same image. From one round to the 
next, they projected the one idea 
that obsessed them. What they 
hoped for was that they would 
draw either a sequence of men who 
could comprehend their theories, 
or that those who didn’t would be 
too stupid to distract them. Cyl had 
to break down the chessplayer’s 
conformance, somehow, think of 
something that would wreck the 
precision of a chess game. The an- 
swer had come to him. He decided 
he would simply create a physical 
experience here and now which he 
could bring to mind during his 
mental struggle with the master. So 
he scooped up the chess pieces and 
walked to the kitchen, savoring the 
experience as much as possible. He 
dropped the little dolls into the dis- 
posal unit, one by one, as if he were 
supposed to be absolutely sure of 
their death. It was evident from the 
gritty, staccato whine that the ap- 
pliance was not made for grinding 




108 

plastatron. It soon stopped dead. 
That had been unfortunate, but to 
Cyl’s joy, he found it enabled him 
to retrieve the chips and dust that 
used to be chessmen. This treasure 
he carried back to the board. He 
played a couple of mock-serious 
games with the rubble. He pushed 
a little bit of dust here, captured a 
chip there, and finally checkmated 
a beheaded King. The crazy thing 
about it was that when he had fin- 
ished and jumbled the remains off 
onto the floor, he had felt sure his 
idea would be a success. 

It was understandable that Lin 
would take a dim view of the in- 
sane operation, but Gyl had really 
been surprised at her that time. She 
became very emotional, cried, said 
he didn’t understand her. What a 
peculiar thing to say! Anyway, he 
couldn’t worry about something like 
that now. If he won there would be 
lots of time to make up for the 
strain. 



C YL bent close to the picture on 
the program again. What he 
knew about his opponent wasn’t 
going to be of much use because 
this man was one of those frighten- 
ing dark horses. Hardly anyone 
went to see him. Why? Everybody 
liked Cyl’s projections. They were 
varied, subtle. He liked them that 
way. 

Sometimes they were full of the 
conversation of things that had 
never talked before, almost going 
out of control as though he were 
just a loudspeaker, through which 
one could hear, at last, the sound 
of a clam working its way into the 
sand, or a goose’s bill rattling at 



GAVIN HYDE 

the corn in some far and frosty 
field. 

And the other man? His name 
was Grus. Those who had been 
curious enough to watch him at 
work had come back with an old 
story. Surely it could not be true 
that he had come so far on some 
sort of sexual pitch! But they all 
assured Cyl there was nothing out 
of the ordinary about the man. 
Each time he started the round 
with a very dull series of transmis- 
sions, identified by most people as 
being connected with the mechanics 
of common machines. That was 
plausible. The paper had said Grus 
was a home-appliance repairman. 
Anyway, they went on, Grus would 
continue these occupational ram- 
blings until his opponent overpow- 
ered them. Then he would switch 
to the image of a woman, the 
switch being effected with apparent 
ease. From that moment on Grus’ 
competitors had little power over 
the development of the thought. 
The most peculiar quality in the 
women Grus imagined was the 
plain, unexciting appearance — no 
beautiful bodies or come-hither 
looks. These were just old or young, 
bored or sad, forgotten or unloved 
women. Many of his opponents had 
been questioned after the round. 
Who was the woman? What was 
the power of Grus’ thought? Not 
one of the men had an answer. 
Naturally the beaten ones didn’t 
feel much like talking to reporters 
and curious contestants, but from 
what they did say it was definite the 
woman on the screen was no ac- 
quaintance, living, dead, or 
dreamed.

THE CONTEST

the door said, “Mr. Mar, you have 
five minutes.” 

Then he heard his wife’s steps 
click-clicking down the smooth, 
white hall. She came into the room 
and sat down, with her purse, as 
though the setting-down of the 
purse was just as important as the 
seating of the body. She knew she 
mustn’t speak. 

Gyl would either have to invent 
TT machines that could be carried 
by husband and wife or quit the 
contest. He wasn’t worried about 
himself. He could live among the 
suspended splinters of his mind. Re- 
actions were conversation. But then 
there was love, which could never 
be kept within the safe confines of 
the mind. Love was too frantic. It 
broke through the skull and left its 
hard cloven hoofprints everywhere, 
never forgetting, though, to return 
to rest, to sleep, and to play its sur- 
prising part in the drama of dreams 
as a young African girl swimming, 
or a red-skirted maid who has lin- 
gered a moment too long in the 
garden, who stops just once on the 
walk under the ivory wall, to look 
into your eyes. 

Cyl walked past Lin. He almost 
said something to her as he paused 
before stepping out into the hall, 
but he knew she would have re- 
leased a flood of words. He couldn’t 
afford to think about what she said 
now. Her white-gloved hand was 
lightly closed on the orange front- 
row ticket. 

There was no cheering when Cyl 
walked across the stage and sat 
down. The Contest Board had 
asked that noise be kept to a mini- 
mum. But there was always a heavy 
murmur, feet scuffling and cough- 



ing. It was soothing to Cyl. He had 
been a favorite in his long fight and 
he knew they wanted to see him 
crowned. Especially since most of 
them had seen Grus at the projec- 
tion and had developed a firm dis- 
like for him. 

Grus seemed to be calm, had his 
helmet adjusted, and was chatting 
with one of the technicians. 



T HE RED LIGHT was on. The 
audience quieted. Cyl thought 
of the hum of bees working in a 
group of white, weatherbeaten 
hives. He hoped this would emerge 
well on the screen after the buzzer 
and also attack at close quarters by 
the white enamel kitchen that he 
expected from Grus. There was the 
buzzer. 

It was chaotic, like the begin- 
ning of every round between strong 
imaginations. Cyl worked to estab- 
lish two levels of thought. One 
dictated his course of action. The 
other was the actual, projected 
thought which would affect the 
screen picture. This was usual, be- 
cause if one’s strategy got mixed 
up with one’s projection he would 
become easy prey to the simplest 
idea from his opponent. 

He had guessed almost right. 
Grus started with the inner parts 
of the hamper of a common laun- 
dry system. It was sorting the 
clothes into different groups, deli- 
cate rayons one way, denim work- 
clothes another. Cyl’s hives were 
petrifying the cloth and his bees 
were becoming more and more 
numerous, so that when he had 
thought them all out of the hives 
there was a cloud of humming.

walking, flying, seething bees that 
was shutting out the whiteness of 
the laundry. Grus backed his clothes 
down through the machine until 
they reached the washing element 
and began turning CyPs bees into 
dirty suds, flowing and pushing. It 
was time for Cyl to make his play 
for dominance. 

The sea. He was looking back 
over the stern of a ship. The water 
was boiling away from him with the 
ferocity that only the sea has. The 
clothes became translucent eels, 
falling over each other in their ef- 
fort to feed on the remaining bees. 
They leaped out and slimed against 
each other. They dove in the white 
froth. 

Grus was trying to bring back 
the precision of his machine. He 
tried to ram Cyl head-on with the 
image of black pistons and sharp 
cogs soaking and dripping in oil. 
The machine parts became obvious 
only at intervals, in the dark lines 
that surrounded the white foam, 
but the viscosity was ruining CyPs 
spray, and his eels were flowing to- 
gether into a conveyor belt. So out 
of the sleek pistons Cyl made dart- 
ing sharks with black, black fins 
that slashed among the eels, divid- 
ing them and throwing their 
mauled, bloody bodies aside into 
the greener brine. Cyl relaxed, but 
realized moments later that Grus 
was not the pushover he had 
seemed so far. 

For CyPs sharks, which had 
promised to be unapproachable in 
speed and ferocity, had, with per- 
fect subtlety, been turned into a 
group of men in tails enjoying a 
Christmas party. The dazzling 
foam was a swirling snowfall, the 



blood a spray of holly berries here 
and there among green spears of 
pine and fir. Grus was doing his 
best work in black and white. His 
stiff, black men were like dolls, per- 
ambulating around a Christmas 
tree. Grus was not sympathetic with 
the green and red that had been left 
over from CyPs image, for those 
colors were suffering a snow change, 
becoming colder, whiter, crisper as 
the winter fell in upon them. The 
walls disappeared into the gloomy 
whiteness, the tree was heavier with 
snow, but the men who before 
seemed festive took on a funereal 
quality. The slow flakes passed 
them, for they were just visiting. 
The background remained a dark 
void. The tree never reached the 
formless stage, but shook itself and 
weaved from side to side. It was a 
huge white bear. The men stopped 
their slow traveling at this and as 
though at a signal filed into the 
dark cave. The animal turned, 
hunched and shook himself once 
more, and followed them. 

As a man wakes who has been 
forbidden to sleep, Cyl escaped the 
other man’s mind with a feeling of 
total fear, mental and physical. He 
looked apprehensively at the clock. 
Grus had managed only to catch up 
what he had lost in the beginning 
of the round. But why did he stop? 
He must have tired his mind, until 
his thoughts just fell from the peak 
of imaginative power into that 
shaded opening, fatigue. 

Cyl was reassured of this as he 
let his mind slip back to the pro- 
jection. Grus had returned to a 
sleek, silent home-freezer. Cyl 
threw himself into the effort to 
reach Grus with some thought that 




THE CONTEST 



111 



would be familiar to him. He had 
to do that before he could met- 
amorphose the idea for his own 
purposes. By imagining the storage 
contents of the box, Cyl brought 
into the projection a lot of waxed 
cartons of ice cream. As he reveled 
in their cold, sweet smell he saw 
himself as the head on a coin, 
buried in a large, square, white 
birthday cake. He heard the muffled 
voices of the children singing 
“Happy Birthday to You,” the girls 
fairly well oriented to the words and 
rhythm of the song, the boys lag- 
ging behind or forging ahead, as 
well as the voice of one misguided 
child who was familiar only with 
the words, “Home, Home on the 
Range,” for he used these lyrics for 
each line. 



T HE SONG was finished now 
and he could hear the candles 
snapping and fluttering above him. 
Suddenly there was noise. The table 
shuddered, forks and knives clanged 
together, fists pounded on the crepe 
tablecloth and pieces of gum were 
pressed against the underside of the 
table with a faint squashing sound. 
The knife hissed through the airy 
cake, but contrary to tradition, it 
caught Cyl on his serrated edge and 
rolled him out on the plate, bared. 
All that remained was the knife 
which lay beside him and his wife’s 
face. She looked down at him from 
above with gray indifference. 

Cast out of dominance by his 
wife’s image? It was she! Yet it 
wasn’t. She didn’t look like that, 
walking down the street. That 
wasn’t the way she looked when 
she sat and watched him perform. 



He glanced quickly at her seat. 
It was empty. 

The projection now showed her 
lying on their bed. For an instant 
Cyl felt embarrassed at the idea 
of her being held up in front of the 
public, but then he realized that 
to them it was just any old mid- 
morning housewife. 

Cyl looked down again, search- 
ing the auditorium seats. Then he 
saw her. She wasn’t out yet. But she 
was walking quickly away, a small 
back in the shadows of the great 
hall. All the faces were turned to 
him except one. She moved toward 
the little door so far up the aisle. 
There was a flash of white light. 

She was gone. 

Gone? The word echoed in his 
mind like the bell on the door of a 
grocery store. It rang. Someone had 
left, left him among the sweet smells 
of coffeecake and wheat crackers. 
So much alone, here. He wanted to 
run to the jingie door and yell, 
“Come back! What about all these 
wonderful things? These wonderful 
things we are going to have? Lin! 
These . .” But the bell had tinkled. 
It had already said, “gone.” 

Cyl’s mind wandered, crazed, 
over the events of the last few mo- 
ments. Grus. Grus. What had he 
done? Something like the chessmen. 
That’s what Cyl and Lin were like 
now, wasn’t it? Grus had picked 
them up before, sliced them up. 
Then he had strewn the pieces. 
Grus, come a-riding to Cyl’s door 
on one of his cement mixers. See 
this! You have a silver candlestick, 
mister? He’ll make dimes of it, and 
for half price! 

Grus dominating the screen, for 
Cyl could no longer focus on the 




GAVIN HYDE

contest of thoughts ... his thoughts 
were now only of Lin. No reason to 
go on trying, nothing down here in 
the ashes, in the obsidian loneliness 
where the flowers, once so red and 
yellow, are black and painful — for 
the lack of the lovely eyes to look 
upon them. Lin’s eyes. 

And when he saw her eyes again 
for that fleeting moment, he saw a 
light. It was a light of memory only, 
now that everything was over, but 
he had to cling to it. Anything to 
save him from the utter darkness. 
He saw a plain with stars over- 
head, and down below the myriad 
lights of a festival. For Cyl, a be- 
ginning. A beautiful memory, Lin, 
the first time he had looked at her. 

She was a young girl standing 
near the crowd that had gathered 
to watch one of those rocket launch- 
ings. They were all jabbering. The 
danger. The chances one took! Oh, 
the bravery. Except for the chil- 
dren, of course, who were stealing 
things to take back to their bed- 
rooms. The police were working 
their way around the circle trying 
to keep people from breaking into 
the flash zone. She was standing 
near the knot of pilots, who were 
attaching to their bodies the equip- 
ment they could put on outside of 
the rocket. It was obvious she 
wanted to go nearer but was too 
self-conscious to do so, or perhaps 
afraid she might touch one of them 
strangely, on the shoulder, and thus 
enchant him forever. Yes, she was 
afraid that some part of her might 
go with these heroes and yet she 
was loath to believe she could give 
them nothing. Then one of them 
said, “Take a good look, wonder- 
boys. That may be the last chick 



you’ll see, let alone get close to.” 
At this she turned away with a look 
of infinite pity and resignation that 
left her eyes burning in the night, 
there on the plain, and walked 
back into the city. 

Once more. Cyl saw her eyes, 
luminous. Springtime. 

Springtime, and the contest had 
ended for the year. He was in one 
of his favorite haunts, the Museum 
of Natural History, in the room of 
the luminous minerals. It was won- 
derful to stand there, in the dark, 
with thousands of eternal eyes look- 
ing at you, all impassive. There was 
no accusation there; only a silent, 
heavenly atmosphere of immortal- 
ity * 

Someone was standing on the 
other side of the room. Silhouetted 
against pale green stones etched 
with fantastic pink lines, was the 
girl he had seen the year before. 
He couldn’t see her features, but he 
knew from the shock to his senses 
that it must be she. 

Soon Cyl stood very near her. He 
wanted to go on, really, go on 
around and out into the sunlight 
of the courtyard. It would be much 
simpler than marrying this woman, 
after all. But it was too late to go 
on. 

He looked past her hair, a last 
time, at the doorway. But his eyes 
returned to her face. Now he had 
to take her with him. He had to 
find out what she did all day. He 
was unaccountably afraid to look at 
her as he said this, so he squinted 
at his watch and said, “Why don’t 
we have a drink somewhere? It’s 
time.” 

Lin had made flowery days of 
the summer. Intense, electric eve-

nings sprang fiercely into the shel- 
tered heart of the dense foliage out- 
side Cyl’s window. The nights slid 
away from the circle of the week as 
quickly as the delicate balance of 
midnight was disturbed. 

In the fall, when Cyl looked out 
and saw the ice-cream man and the 
children and the shoppers running 
before red leaves in the wind, he 
told Lin that he was determined 
to marry her immediately. Every 
day Cyl discovered that he was 
wrong when he decided that one or 
another part of her face or body 
was most beautiful. One morning 
he was convinced her lips were so 
cool and fragrant that the rest of 
the day must be evil to soften them. 
And that night as he watched sleep 
invade that same flesh he was sorry 
to see the effects of the day’s ex- 
periences erased. 



HE BUZZER and the last rude 
noises in the great Thought- 
Transfer machine were unwelcome 
in CyPs life now, because there was 
no life. None that he wanted. 

The loud speakers were blaring 
the name of Cyl Mar! The Board 
had written his name on the blank 
check and had cast a huge picture 
of it on the back wall of the audi- 
torium, for the spectators to see on 
their way out. 

The contest was over. He had 
forgotten all about the contest. 
Grus? He had forgotten all about 
Grus. There was only memory and 
Lin. Stunned, Cyl heard himself 
being asked for a few words and he 
felt his lips say the same things he 
had always said. 

They let him go, he stumbled 



past Grus, who was collecting all 
his certificates, credit cards, and 
prizes for runner-up. The crowd 
was leaving in a vast, swelled mur- 
mur. He wanted to get away, lock 
himself in his cubicle and rave at 
himself as a fool screams at a fool, 
louder, louder! Make faces at him- 
self, feel his face with his hands, as 
though the physical world which he 
had seemed to reject would believe 
this sort of proof that he recognized 
it. But all the indirect, mystic, or 
magical tricks would never bring 
her back. Exhausted, he stood on 
the edge of the stage, where the 
gray seats stretched away from him 
like waves in a sea. The crowd was 
gone, the auditorium empty. The 
technicians behind him were test- 
ing the equipment, before switching 
off. One of the mechanics wore the 
thought helmet, projecting plush 
leather, red wine, and ivory women 
on the screen, smiling. 

Cyl did not move. He looked up 
and yet further up through the 
empty auditorium. It was not quite 
empty. 

His breath tightened, and his 
heart moved in the hollowness. 

A single person sat alone in the 
very last row. The person did not 
move. The person looked back 
down over the emptiness, reaching 
as Cyl was reaching. She was very 
beautiful. 

Lin. 

She had decided to go, had 
walked out forever, because she had 
thought Grus was right, because 
she was ashamed. But once outside, 
she had paused, thought Cyl, and 
gone to the balcony to watch, to 
see all of it, to know the rest. 

Lin. Lin. She sat above, quiet. 





114

He did not trust himself to call 
out to her. He turned to the ma- 
chine, the technicians, the helmet. 
Quietly, he took the helmet, placed 
it on his head. He closed his eyes. 
He knew what he could, what he 
must, paint there on the screen. 

And there it was for her. There 
it happened for her eyes. 

On the screen, a picture of him- 
self walking off the stage and up the 
aisle. And a picture of her getting 
up from her place in the balcony 
and walking out through the door 
and down the quiet stairs. Himself 



coming out into the lobby, their 
meeting. And now they were tak- 
ing each others’ hands, warm and 
belonging, and now they were kiss- 
ing, now moving silently past the 
cool fountains, out of the theatre. 

He opened his eyes and removed 
the helmet. A glance told him that, 
in the balcony, Lin was already 
suiting action to the image. She 
rose. She was smiling. She turned 
and walked. 

Cyl stepped down from the stage. 
He started up the aisle. Then, he 
was running.

ly don’t know.” 

But the two spacemen, though 
they didn’t refer to it — were not 
concerned with the body so much 
as the aura of completeness, the 
radiation of contentment which 
came from somewhere within. 

And it was passing strange that 
nothing more was said about the 
Professor returning to Earth. No 
great revelation, suddenly arrived 
at, that he would not go. Rather, 
they discussed various things, that 
three gentlemen, meeting casually, 
would discuss. 

Then Professor Pettibone arose 
from his chair and said, “It was 
kind of you to drop off and see 
me. 

And one of the spacemen re- 
plied, “A pleasure, sir. A real pleas- 
ure indeed.” 

Then the Professor left the ship 



and watched it lift up on a tail of 
red fire and go away. He raised 
an arm and waved. “Say hello for 
me,” he called. Then he turned 
away and, from force of habit, he 
began again to polish the hull, 
knowing that he would keep it 
shining, and be proud of it, for 
many years to come. 

Almost beyond reach of the 
planet, one of the spacemen flipped 
a switch and put certain sensitive 
communication mechanisms to 
work. So sensitive, they could pick 
up etheric vibrations far away and 
make them audible. 

But only faintly, came the pleas- 
ant voice of a contented man : 

“Good morning bright sunshine, 

We’re glad you are here. 

You make the world . 



THE END 





Specific Gravity of Space 

CPECIFIC GRAVITY, the fa- 
*3 miliar concept of comparing 
the weight of a thing or substance 
with an equal volume of water, is 
widely used, but it isn’t often that 
you find such a computation made 
in connection with all of space! 
Cosmologists, however, are inter- 
ested in discovering the distribu- 
tion of matter throughout the uni- 
verse and it is a valuable piece of 
knowledge to have some idea of 
the “specific gravity”, or density 
(to be correct), of matter in that 
vast volume of nothingness. 

Someone will immediately ques- 
tion the idea with “but you don’t 
know how big Space is!” That’s 
true; yet telescopes can probe hun- 
dreds — even thousands — of millions 
of light-years into space and they 
can sample a big enough volume to 
make the concept “density of the 
universe” perfectly valid. Subse- 
quent penetration of space — if 
that’s possible and the universe is 
not finite — is not likely to change 
the figure by much. 

It turns out that the density is — 
as you would suspect — fantastically 
low. After all there is a lot of 
empty space to consider. In techni- 
cal terms the density is about ten 



to the centimeter — or, in familiar 
terms, about a pound of matter to 
the volume occupied by thirty 
thousand Earths! That is rareness 
and vacuity indeed! Nevertheless, 
when you consider the total vol- 
ume of the known universe, that’s 
a lot of stuff. Assuming that the 
universe is six hundred million 
light-years in diameter — and it’s 
certainly more than this — all you 
need do is apply the formula for 
the volume of a sphere — four- 
thirds pi times the radius cubed — 
and you come up with an answer 
in cubic light-years which literally 
takes your breath away. The spe- 
cific gravity of the universe is 
mighty, mighty low. 

Who Needs Gravity? 

F OR THE FIRST time the Air 
Force recently revealed data 
and photographs showing that live 
animals — mice and monkeys — had 
been sent up in V-2 and Aerobee 
rockets to altitudes of 80 miles, to 
test their reactions at zero gravity. 
Even though they were subjected 
to a brief, one-second acceleration 
of about 15 g and a force of 3 to 
4 g, which lasted for 45 seconds, 
the animals showed absolutely no 
unusual aftereffects from the ex- 
perimental flight. 

One of the photographs made 
available shows a mouse floating in 
a plastic drum. Since the walls of 
the drum were glassy smooth, the 
animal was unable to gain a foot- 
hold and was undoubtedly in a 
state of helpless panic. Another 
photograph shows a mouse in an 
adjoining section of the drum. 
This section had a shelf, and the

second mouse was able to take firm 
hold, stay calm, and keep his equi- 
librium while the rocket shot 
through the weightless period. 

The results of these experiments, 
plus others in which several hu- 
mans took part in jet fighter planes, 
lead to the conclusion that it is un- 
doubtedly possible for man to be 
able to stand for brief periods the 
gravity-free state expected in rock- 
et flight to the outer atmosphere. 
But he must have something to 
hang on to. Properly secured in the 
aircraft, he should be able to func- 
tion normally during brief periods 
of zero gravity, and without diffi- 
culty should be able to perform any 
operations that would be necessary 
to pilot the craft. 

Why Rotation Varies 

T^OR YEARS the irregular fluc- 
tuation occurring periodically in 
the earth’s rate of rotation has puz- 
zled scientists. Recent studies of the 
optical properties of the mineral 
olivine under high pressures, how- 
ever, give some idea of what the 
electrical conductivity at earth’s 
center is like — and there is now a 
possible explanation to the fluctu- 
ations : It may be due to the activ- 
ity of an electromagnetic coupling 
which is located between the man- 
tle of the earth and earth’s liquid 
center. 

According to evidence which 
scientists have carefully gathered, it 
is probable that the earth’s mantle 
consists in great part of the mineral 
olivine. Under normal conditions 
olivine acts as an insulator, but the 
high temperatures raging within 
the earth are strong enough to 



change its properties there so that 
it becomes a conductor. 

The electrical conductivity of 
the earth’s mantle plays an impor- 
tant role in many geophysical phe- 
nomena, one of which of course is 
to provide the electromagnetic 
coupling between the mantle of the 
earth and the center of the earth, 
and the resulting activity of the 
coupling, which may possibly ex- 
plain the variance in the earth’s 
rate of rotation. 

Unknown Universe? 

A CCORDING to a theory which 
astronomers have been working 
on for almost 2,000 years, there are 
stars in the sky that do not twinkle. 
This means there may be as many 
invisible as visible stars in the uni- 
verse, thus indicating that it is en- 
tirely possible that there exists a 
duplicate universe, of which we 
have no knowledge. 

A British research foundation, in 
conjunction with the British gov- 
ernment, has recently announced 
they are building a giant radio-tele- 
scope, at a cost of approximately 
$1,120,000. With this huge instru- 
ment, scientists will try to locate 
the invisible stars. These may be 
radio stars, or dark stars. They may 
be stars in the process of being born 
or of dying. They may even be 
some completely new type of ob- 
ject of which our astronomers have 
no previous knowledge. 

Birth of a Star 

U NLIKE the birth of most of 
Nature’s offspring, a star is 
formed almost purely by accident. 




SCIENCE BRIEFS 



117 



It begins to be created when inter- 
stellar gases in a cloud are brought 
together unevenly. The embryo 
star adds to its mass by picking up 
other gases as it makes its way 
through the cloud. It grows fast, 
and eventually moves out of its 
parent cloud and into a free space 
which has only irregular dottings 
of gas clouds. 

According to a recent lecture by 
Professor Fred Hoyle of St. John’s 
College in Cambridge, England, 
further growth of the star by the 
addition of external material, once 
it has left its parent cloud, is fairly 
rare. Perhaps one star in a hun- 
dred will experience a second pe- 
riod of growth, while only one in a 
million will experience both a sec- 
ond and a third growth. 

The second period stars become 
moderately large. The stars that 
get to an exceptionally high mass, 
however, are the three-period stars. 

That Old Bloodthirsty 
Mother Goose 

M OTHER GOOSE — litera- 
ture’s benign old lady of let- 
ters — is actually a bloodthirsty 
vampire. Very few persons realize 
that the traditional nursery rhymes, 



which have been used for genera- 
tions to amuse and entertain inno- 
cent childhood, are filled with an 
overwhelming amount of villainous 
references, of death and violence 
and shocking horrors, masquerad- 
ing under a mask of innocence. 

Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, found- 
er of the British Poetry-Drama 
Guild, is an active crusader for the 
reform of the old-fashioned nursery 
rhymes. Out of 200 famous tradi- 
tional nursery rhymes which he re- 
cently studied in detail, he says at 
least 100 of them contain “un- 
savory elements”. A detailed listing 
of their contents include : 200 allu- 
sions to death, violence and de- 
pravity, including eight cases of 
murder, two cases of choking to 
death, three of death by drowning, 
one each of death by devouring, 
decapitation, squeezing, cutting a 
human being in half, starvation, 
shrivelling, boiling, and hanging. 

There’s even a blow for starry- 
eyed newlyweds, in one rhyme, 
which contains an allusion to mar- 
riage being another form of death. 

Today’s radio and television pro- 
grams of horror and suspense — 
which are bringing such loud pro- 
tests of disapproval from parents — 
can well take a back seat to the old 
classics for children. — Peter Dakin

AMATEUR 
TELESCOPE MAKER 

Dear Sirs: 

An item in IF, September 1952 
issue (Science Briefs) on the sub- 
ject of optical sandblasting proved 
to be of considerable interest to me. 
Mr. Recour refers to the technique 
devised by Dr. Wm. A. Rhodes. 

I have made many telescope 
mirrors (all by the “old hat” meth- 
od) and quite naturally the Doc- 
tor’s technique (and its apparent 
time-saving) opens up new possi- 
bilities for amateur telescope mak- 
ers, including myself. As Director 
of the Amateur Telescope Makers’ 
Group in Toronto, Ontario, I have 
watched the rapid growth of pub- 
lic interest in the hobby, hand in 
hand with the also rapid develop- 
ment of time-and-effort-saving ap- 
paratus for making the mirror. The 
process of grinding has by no 
means been the least of the deter- 
rents to amateurs, because of the 
relatively long period of work re- 
quired without any apparent ap- 
proach to the finished product. 
Consequently, I feel sure that my 
fellow amateurs will consider Dr. 



Rhodes’ method of sandblasting 
the base curve a useful advance in 
the mirror technique, especially in 
the larger sizes. 

While the possibility of sand-

AN OLD MONEY ORDER, 
DA VINCI AND 
NOSTRADAMUS 
Dear Sir: 

Enclosed you will find one slight- 
ly battered and beat-up money or- 
der. It was originally bought in Ko- 
rea 8/ 2 months ago but, just as it 
was about to be put into an en- 
velope, several incoming rounds of 
enemy artillery followed by a call 
for a rather actively interesting 
combat patrol caused it to be mis- 
placed. It finally turned up when 
I was looking through some old 
letters a few days ago. 

It is made out for $3.50, enough 
for a subscription for 12 issues. 

I have just finished the Novem- 
ber issue of IF. Very good; I liked 
especially the makeup and clear 
type which made the issue very 
easy to read. I won’t list the stories 
in order of preference except to 
say that “The Image and the Like-

ness” was definitely the best and 
the feature on Leonardo da Vinci 
was very interesting. A full length 
article with a few diagrams of some 
of his inventions would be good for 
a later issue. Or how about Nostra- 
damus and his predictions? 

You have an attractive, flexible 
magazine. Keep up the good work.

That poor little old money order 
was good as gold. We hope you 3 ll 
find IF comparably good. 

THAT WORD 
“EXTRAPOLATE” 

Sirs: 

Inclosed find my check for $3.50, 
for which please send me 12 issues 
of IF, beginning with the January 
number. 

The November number is the 
only copy of any science fiction 
magazine which does not use the 
word “extrapolate” even once — 
for which receive my congratula- 
tions. What is it about that word 
that bewitches science fiction writ- 
ers? One doesn’t encounter it often 
in other fiction. Is it a sort of code 
in sf? Even writers whose knowl- 
edge of English grammar is a bit 
shaky manage to use it; in fact, es- 
pecially writers in that category. 

The Image and the Likeness is 
a beautiful bit of allegory as well as 
a touching story. Such flights of 
fancy justify science fiction as liter- 
ature. 

With good wishes to your maga- 



zine (but I do hate the sexy cov- 
ers).

OF CHARACTERS IN STF 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

The modem Gulliver story titled 
The Image and the Likeness is 
quite well written. My congratula- 
tions to Campbell for achieving 
verisimilitude in the character 
Kazu. Most characters in stf make 
me think of the joke (?) concern- 
ing the comment of an editor on a 
manuscript. Remember it? The 
Writer had inserted the law-suit pre- 
ventative “All characters appear- 
ing in this story are fictional. Any 
similarity to actual persons is cofti- 
cidental.” The plagued editor pen- 
ciled a note, “That’s the trouble,” 
and tearfully inserted said script in 
the outgoing mail basket. 

The sketch on da Vinci is excel- 
lent. The cover is poor in all over 
effect for me, although the balance 
of color is excellent. The staring 
eyes convey neither attraction nor 
horror and the foreshortened arms 
look like flippers. The bodies are 
neither opaque (witness planet 
line on legs) nor transparent, 
since solid continents in back- 
ground are obliterated by trunks 
and Bell-jarred headdress.

DISPENSE WITH 
HUMOROUS STORIES? 

To the Editor: 

I was very impressed with your 
leading novel in the November 




120 



THE POSTMAN COMETH 



issue. It was easily the most ab- 
sorbing story I have yet read on the 
theme of Atomic mutation. The 
best story in the issue, though, was 
The Running Hounds . Indeed a 
vivid portrayal of the changes 
which could take place in a culture 
as the result of highly technologi- 
cal warfare. I’d like to commend 
IF on its good discretion in stories. 
It’s good to see that, as is true in 
some magazines, the so-called gim- 
mick is not allowed to overshadow 
the characterization and the inter- 
play of people. 

For my money, although I know 
you can’t please everybody, you can 
dispense with the humorous stories. 
I’ve read very few in my time 
which I believe were very successful. 

Your covers are improving with 
each issue, the November one be- 
ing the best so far. I think, and 
again I realize that you can’t please 
everyone, that the cover should 
illustrate one of the stories, not 
necessarily the leading novel. 

You’ll be receiving my subscrip- 
tion.

Our cover policy was explained in 
the March issue. Regarding humor > 
we need it sometimes , hut agree 
that it has to he well handled. 

THE NOVEMBER ISSUE 
AGAIN! 

Dear Sir: 

Your November issue of IF was 
tops in my opinion. I’ve read the 
mag ever since its inception and 
have followed its progress with in- 
terest. The cover ... is absolutely 



the best yet. It attracted me with 
such intensity at the newsstands 
that I frankly felt the interior could 
not live up to such a dazzling cov- 
er-picture. Happy to say, the stories 
were of equal calibre. 

The Image and the Likeness 
was the best of the issue by a good 
590 feet. Seldom have I read a 
story as realistic and enthralling as 
this one during my ten years of 
avid stf reading. This one was so 
good that even raving about it 
would be an understatement . 

The Running Hounds was next 
on my list. A well turned tale, one 
that stays in my mind and suggests 
the possibility of a sequel . 

Brother to the Machine was next 
in preference; a hauntingly written 
story. If this issue of IF is any yard- 
stick I would say you have 
achieved what some of the other 
mags in the field are clamoring 
(falsely) that they have . quality 
in material. 

Your inside covers are very wel- 
come. I hope they continue. Your 
Personalities in Science feature is 
excellent. This is quite a statement 
coming from someone who avoids 
features like the plague. This one 
is being handled very nicely. The 
Postman Cometh is just right in 
length. I find when a mag starts 
printing poor quality stories they 
enlarge their readers’ column, 
probably so the readers will have 
some reason to buy the mag. Keep 
yours short and your stories good 
and you’ll have few complaints 
from this comer. Definitely com- 
pliments on the November IF.

JUPITER — The largest planet in our system presents many difficulties to the 
explorer. Its hostile atmosphere of ammonia and methane, coupled with a 
seething volcanic surface, promises to make any attempt at landing highly 
improbable. In this space scene, an exploration rocket streaks over Jupiter's 
bulk, approximately 100,000 miles above its equator. In the background 
above the rocket are three of Jupiter's eleven moons, all of which seem to 
invite comparatively safe exploration.
