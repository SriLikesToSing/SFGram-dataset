STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. Il's 
also a tool; a lime machine (hal enables you 
lo replay the crucial events — past, present, 
and future — tbal shape our lives. 

Now, instead of merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 

What ie Conflict Simulation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created — so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and, in the game at 
least, change the way things were, are, or 
will be. 

What fou gel 

STRATEGY & TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

*A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 X 26" playing surface, die-cut play- 



ing pieces, and complete rules. 

* An analytical article on the same subject as 
the game in that issue. 

it Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

* Game and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers' 
questions. 

The magazine is 48 + pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic formal. 

Games recently published in STRATEGY & 
TACTICS were: Gf^UNT (ground combat in 
Vietnam), LOST BATTLES (tactical combat in 
Russia. 1941-44), USN (the war in the Pacific, 
1941-43), COMBAT COMMAND (tactical com- 
bat in Western Europe. 1944). 

We also publish a separate line of conflict- 
simulation games, which you will find listed in 
the coupon.

FIRST OF TWO PARTS 



A world turned inside out 
came hurtling through space. 
Did it mean the end of 
man— or another beginning? 



It was bound to happen 
sooner or later. On June 
30, 1908, Moscow had es- 
caped destruction by three 
hours and four thousand ki- 
lometers — a margin invis- 
ibly small by the standards 
of the universe. On February 
12, 1947, a city in Siberia 
had a still narrower escape 
when the second great me- 
teorite of the twentieth 
century detonated less than 
four hundred kilometers 
from Vladivostok, the ex- 
plosion rivaling the force of 
the newly invented uranium 
bomb. 

In those days men could do 
nothing to protect them- 
selves against the last ran- 
dom shots in the cosmic 
bombardment that had 
once scarred the face of the 
moon. The meteorites of 
1908 and 1947 had struck un- 
inhabited wilderness, but by 
the end of the twenty-first 
century, there was no region 
left on Earth that could be 
safely used for celestial tar- 



get practice. The human 
race had spread from pole to 
pole. And so, inevitably . 

I 

A t 09.46 G.M.T. on the morn- 
ing of September 2, in the ex- 
ceptionally beautiful summer of 
the year 2077, most of the inhabi- 
tants of Europe saw a dazzling 
fireball appear in the eastern 
sky. Within seconds it was bright- 
er than the sun and as it moved 
across the heavens — at first in ut- 
ter silence — it left behind it a 
churning column of dust and 
smoke. 

Somewhere above Austria it be- 
gan to disintegrate, producing a 
series of concussions so violent 
that more than a million people 
had their hearing permanently 
damaged. They were the lucky 
ones. 

Moving at fifty kilometers a sec- 
ond, a thousand tons of rock and 
metal impacted on the plains of 
northern Italy, destroying in a 
few flaming moments the labor of 
centuries. The cities of Padua and 
Verona were wiped from the face 
of the earth and the last glories of 
Venice sank forever beneath the 
sea as the waters of the Adriatic 
came thundering landward after 
the hammer blow from space. 

Six hundred thousand people 
died and the total damage was 
more than a trillion dollars. But 
the loss to art, to history, to sci- 
ence — to the whole human race, 
for the rest of time — was beyond 
all computation. If was as if a 
great war had been fought and lost 
in a single morning— and few 



could draw much pleasure from 
the fact that, as the dust of destruc- 
tion slowly settled, for months the 
whole world witnessed the most 
splendid dawns and sunsets since 
Krakatoa. 

After the initial shock, mankind 
reacted with a determination 
and a unity that no earlier age 
could have shown. Such a disaster, 
it was realized, might not occur 
again for a thousand years — but it 
might occur tomorrow. And the 
next time the consequences would 
be even worse. 

There could be no next time . 

A hundred years earlier a much 
poorer world, with far feebler re- 
sources, had squandered its wealth 
attempting to destroy weapons 
launched suicidally by mankind 
against itself. The effort had nev- 
er been successful, but the skills 
acquired then had not been for- 
gotten. Now they could be used 
for a far nobler purpose and on an 
infinitely vaster stage. No me- 
teorite. large enough to cause 
catastrophe would ever again be 
allowed to breach the defenses of 
Earth. 

So began Project spaceguard. 
Fifty years later — and in a way that 
none of its designers could ever 
have anticipated — it justified its 
existence. 

B y the year 2130 the Mars- 
based radars were discovering 
new asteroids at the rate of a 
dozen a day. The spaceguard 
computers automatically calcu- 
lated their orbits and stored away 
the information in their enor- 
mous memories, so that every few 
months any interested astrono- 



6 



GALAXY 




mer could have a look at the ac- 
cumulated statistics. These were 
now quite impressive. 

It had taken more than a hun- 
dred and twenty years to collect 
the first thou.sand asteroids, fol- 
lowing the discovery of Ceres, 
largest of these tiny worlds, on the 
very first day of the nineteenth 
century. Hundreds had been 
found and lost and found 
again — they existed in such swarms 
that one exasperated astronomer 
had christened them “vermin of 
the skies.” Only the five 
giants — Ceres, Pallas, Juno, 
Eunomia and Vesta — were more 
than two hundred kilometers in 
diameter. The vast majority were 
merely oversized boulders that 
would fit into a small park. Al- 
most all moved in orbits that lay 
beyond Mars — only the few that 
came far enough sunward to be a 
possible danger to Earth were the 
concern of spaceguard. And not 
one in a thousand of these, during 
the entire future history of the 
solar system, would pass within a 
million kilometers of Earth. 

The object first catalogued as 
31/439, according to the year and 
the order of its discovery, was 
detected while still outside the 
orbit of Jupiter. Nothing about its 
location was unusual — many 
asteroids went beyond Saturn be- 
fore turning once more toward 
their distant master, the sun. And 
Thule II, most far-ranging of all, 
traveled so close to Uranus that it 
might well be a lost moon of that 
planet. 

But a first radar contact at such 
a distance was unprece- 
dented — ^^clearly, 31/439 must be 



of exceptional size. From the 
strength of the echo the computers 
deduced a diameter of at least 
forty kilometers. Such a giant 
had not been discovered for a 
hundred years. That it had been 
overlooked for so long seemed in- 
credible. 

Then the orbit was calculated 
and the mystery was resolved — to 
be replaced by a greater one. 
31/439 was not traveling on a nor- 
mal asteroidal path, along an el- 
lipse which it retraced with clock- 
work precision every few years. It 
was a lonely wanderer among 
the stars, making its first and last 
visit to the solar system — for it 
was moving so swiftly that the 
gravitational field of the sun 
could never capture it. It would 
flash inward past the orbits of 
Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus and 
Mercury, gaining speed as it did 
so, until it rounded the sun and 
hurtled into the unknown. 

It was at this point that the com- 
puters started flashing their Hi, 
there! We have something inter- 
esting . sign and for the first 
time 31/439 came to the atten- 
tion of human beings. There was 
a brief flurry of excitement at 
SPACEGUARD headquarters and 
the interstellar vagabond was 
quickly dignified by a name in- 
stead of a mere number. The as- 
tronomers had long ago ex- 
hausted Greek and Roman mythol- 
ogy — now they were working 
through the Hindu pantheon. And 
so 3 1 /439 was christened Rama. 

F or a few days the news media 
made a fuss about the visitor, 
but they were badly handicapped 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



7 




by the sparsity of information. 
Only two facts were known about 
Rama — its unusual orbit and its 
approximate size. Even this was 
merely an educated guess, based 
upon the strength of the radar 
echo. Through the telescope 
Rama still appeared as a faint, fif- 
teenth-magnitude star — much too 
small to show as a disk. But as 
it plunged toward the heart of the 
solar system it would grow bright- 
er and larger month by month. Be- 
fore it vanished forever the orbit- 
ing observatories would be able to 
gather more precise informa- 
tion about its shape and size. There 
was plenty of time — and perhaps 
during the next few years some 
spaceship on its ordinary busi- 
ness might be routed close enough 
to get good photographs. An ac- 
tual rendezvous was most unlike- 
ly. The energy cost would be far 
too great to permit physical con- 
tact with an object cutting across 
the orbits of the planets at more 
than a hundred thousand ki- 
lometers an hour. 

So the world soon forgot about 
Rama, but the astronomers did 
not. Their excitement grew with 
the passing months as the new as- 
teroid presented them with more 
and more puzzles. 

Most absorbing of these was the 
problem of Rama’s light curve. It 
didn’t have one. 

All known asteroids, without 
exception, show a slow varia- 
tion in their brilliance, waxing 
and waning with a period of a few 
hours. It had been recognized for 
more than two centuries that this 
phenomenon was an inevitable 
result of their spin and their ir- 



regular shape. As they toppled 
end over end along their orbits, the 
reflecting surfaces they pre- 
sented to the sun were continually 
changing and their brightness 
varied accordingly. 

Rama showed no such changes. 
Either it was not spinning at all or 
it was perfectly symmetrical. 
Both explanations seemed equal- 
ly unlikely. 

There the matter rested for sev- 
eral months, because none of the 
big orbiting telescopes could be 
spared from their regular Job of 
peering into the remote depths of 
the universe. Space astronomy 
was an expensive hobby and time 
on a large instrument could eas- 
ily cost a thousand dollars a min- 
ute. Dr. William Stenton would 
never have been able to grab the 
Farside two-hundred-meter re- 
flector for a full quarter of an 
hour if a more important pro- 
gram had not been temporarily 
derailed by the failure of a fifty- 
cent capacitor. One astrono- 
mer’s bad luck was his good for- 
tune. 

Bill Stenton did not know what 
he had caught until the next day, 
when he was able to get computer 
time to process his results. Even 
when they were finally flashed on 
his display screen it took him sev- 
eral minutes to understand what 
they meant. 

The sunlight reflected from 
Rama was not, after all, absolute- 
ly constant in its intensity. There 
was a very small variation — hard 
to detect, but quite unmistak- 
able and extremely regular. Like 
all the other asteroids, Rama 
was indeed spinning. But where- 



8 



GALAXY 




as the normal “day” for an aster- 
oid was several hours, Rama’s was 
only four minutes. 

Dr. Stenton did some quick cal- 
culations and found it hard to be- 
lieve the results. At its equator this 
tiny world must be spinning at 
more than a thousand kilometers 
an hour — it would be rather un- 
healthy to attempt a landing any- 
where except at the poles. The cen- 
trifugal force at Rama’s equator 
must be powerful enough to flick 
any loose objects away from it at 
an acceleration of almost one 
gravity. Rama was a rolling stone 
that could never have gathered 
any cosmic moss. It was surpris- 
ing that such a body had managed 
to hold itself together and had 
not long ago shattered into a mil- 
lion fragments. 

An object forty kilometers 
across and with a rotation period 
of only four minutes — where did 
that fit into the astronomical 
scheme of things? Dr. Stenton was 
a somewhat imaginative man, a 
little too prone to jump to con- 
clusions. He now jumped to one 
that gave him a very uncomfort- 
able few moments indeed. 

The only specimen of the celes- 
tial zoo that fitted this description 
was a collapsed star. Perhaps 
Rama was a dead sun — a madly 
spinning sphere of neutronium, 
every cubic centimeter weighing 
billions of tons. 

Just then there flashed brief- 
ly through Dr. Stenton’s horrified 
mind the memory of that timeless 
classic, H.G. Wells’ The Star. He 
had first read it as a boy and it had 
helped to spark his interest in as- 
tronomy. Across more than two 



centuries of time it had lost none 
of its magic and its terror. He 
would never forget the images of 
hurricanes and tidal waves, of 
cities sliding into the sea, as that 
other visitor from the stars 
smashed into Jupiter and then fell 
sunward past the Earth. True, the 
star that old Wells described was 
not cold, but incandescent — it 
had wrought much of its destruc- 
tion by heat. The point scarcely 
mattered. Even as a cold body, re- 
flecting only the light of the sun, 
Rama could kill by gravity as 
easily as by fire. 

Any stellar mass intruding into 
the solar system would complete- 
ly distort the orbits of the planets. 
The Earth had only to move a few 
million kilometers sunward — or 
starward — for the delicate bal- 
ance of climate to be destroyed. 
The Antarctic icecap could melt 
and flood all low-lying land or the 
oceans could freeze and the whole 
world be locked in an eternal win- 
ter. Just a nudge in either direc- 
tion would be enough. 

Then Dr. Stenton relaxed and 
breathed a sigh of relief. This was 
all nonsense — he should be 
ashamed of himself. 

Rama could not possibly be 
made of condensed matter. No 
star-sized mass could penetrate so 
deeply into the solar system 
without producing disturbances 
that would have betrayed it long 
ago. The orbits of all the planets 
would have been affected — that, 
after all, was how Neptune, Pluto 
and Persephone had been discov- 
ered. No, it was utterly impos- 
sible for an object as massive as a 
dead sun to sneak up unobserved. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA

In a way it was a pity. An en- 
counter with a dark star would 
have been quite exciting. 

While it lasted. 

T he extraordinary meeting of 
the Space Advisory Council 
was brief and stormy. Even in the 
twenty-second century no way 
had yet been discovered of keep- 
ing elderly and conservative 
scientists from occupying crucial 
administrative positions. In- 
deed, it was doubted that the prob- 
lem ever would be solved. 

To make matters worse, the cur- 
rent chairman of the SAC was 
Professor (Emeritus) Olaf 

Davidson, the distinguished 

astrophysicist. Professor David- 
son was not very much interested 
in objects smaller than galaxies 
and never bothered to conceal 
his prejudices. And though he had 
to admit that ninety percent of 
his science was now based on ob- 
servations from space-borne in- 
struments, he was not at all hap- 
py about it. No less than three 
times during his distinguished 
career, the satellites specially 
launched to prove one of his pet 
theories had done precisely the 
opposite. 

The question before the council 
was straightforward enough. 
There was no doubt that Rama was 
an unusual object — but was it an 
important one? In a few months it 
would be gone forever and sud- 
denly there was little time in 
which to act. Opportunities missed 
now would never recur. 

At a rather horrifying cost a 
space probe soon to be launched 
from Mars to travel beyond Nep- 



tune could be modified and sent on 
a high-speed trajectory to meet 
Rama. There was no hope of a ren- 
dezvous — and it would be the fast- 
est fly-by on record. The two 
bodies would pass each other at 
two hundred thousand kilome- 
ters an hour. Rama would be ob- 
served intensively for only a few 
minutes — and in real close-up for 
less than a second. But with the 
right instrumentation that would 
be long enough to settle many 
questions. 

Although Professor Davidson 
took a very jaundiced view of the 
Neptune probe, it had already 
been approved and he saw no 
point in sending more good mon- 
ey after bad. He spoke eloquent- 
ly on the follies of asteroid-chas- 
ing and the urgent need for a new 
high-resolution interferometer 
on the moon to prove the newly re- 
vived Big Bang theory of creation 
once and for all. 

That was a grave tactical error, 
because the three most ardent sup- 
porters of the Modified Steady 
State Theory were also members 
of the council. They secretly 
agreed with Professor Davidson 
that asteroid-chasing was a waste 
of money — nevertheless . 

He lost by one vote. 

T hree months later the space 
probe, rechristened Sita, was 
launched from Phobos, the inner 
moon of Mars. The flight time was 
seven weeks and the instrument 
was switched to full power only 
five minutes before intercep- 
tion. A cluster of camera pods was 
released simultaneously to sail 
past Rama, so that it could be pho-

tographed from all sides. 

The first images, from ten thou- 
sand kilometers away, brought to a 
halt the activities of all mankind. 
On a billion television screens ap- 
peared a tiny, featureless cylin- 
der, growing rapidly second by 
second. By the time it had dou- 
bled its size no one could pretend 
any longer that Rama was a natur- 
al object. 

Its body was a cylinder so geo- 
metrically perfect that it might 
have been turned on a lathe — one 
with centers fifty kilometers 
apart. The two ends were quite flat, 
apart from some small structures 
at the center of one face, and were 
twenty kilometers across. From a 
distance, when there was no sense 
of scale, Rama looked almost 
comically like an ordinary 
domestic boiler. 

Rama grew until it filled the 
screen. Its surface was a dull, drab 
gray, as colorless as the moon and 
completely devoid of markings 
except at one point. Halfway 
along the cylinder was a kilome- 
ter-wide stain or smear, as if .some- 
thing had once hit and splattered 
there ages ago. 

No sign could be detected that 
the impact had done the slightest 
damage to Rama’s spinning 
walls, but this mark had produced 
the slight fluctuation in bright- 
ness that had led to Stenton’s dis- 
covery. 

The images from the other cam- 
eras added nothing new. However, 
the trajectories their pods traced 
through Rama’s minute gravi- 
tational field gave one other vital 
piece of information — the mass 
of the cylinder.

The biggest and best news of the 
month— although the actual event 
took place a while back— is that 
Judy- Lynn del Rey has joined the 
Ballantines. Welcome to the duck- 
press, Judy. 

The second big news is the acquisi- 
tion by Ballantine (for staggering 
sums of lovely money) of Arthur 
Clarke's new works. This is welcome 
home for Arthur, one of the very 
first greats we ever published (#33 
where are you? Still in print— you 
know it as CHILDHOOD'S END). 



So. August's publications include a 
broth of fresh air titled COOKING 
OUT OF THIS WORLD, edited 
(rather desperately, we suspect) by 
Anne McCaffrey. As a seasoned s.f. 
writer even she could not have antici- 
pated some of the recipes her writing 
fraternity would come up with. But 
it's fun, and there are even some 
good recipes. So plunge in-there is 
nriuch to be learned about your fa- 
vorite authors. Anne herself contri- 
butes TO RIDE PEGASUS, that 
wildly talented lot; and Isidore Hai- 
blum has a mind-boggling TRANS- 
FER TO YESTERDAY. 

The adult fantasy is a first— by 
Anne Sanders Laubenthal who, in-

credibly, makes it probable, even 
likable, that Excalibur should turn 
up in Mobile, Alabama. (Honest to 
God.) We couldn't believe it our- 
selves when she told us— but the 
book is very convincing. Besides 
being splendid adventure. 

• •• 

September— all you Deryni fans 
will be grateful to learn that Kathe- 
rine Kurtz has at last written Volume 
III, HIGH DERYNI— but you have 
not seen the end yet. A fourth, and 
even a fifth, are planned. Adult 
fantasy does not seem to like the 
confines of one volume. 

Larry Niven has a brand new, long, 
complex, wonderful novel called 
PROTECTOR— no point in trying to 
describe, you must experience for 
yourselves— and a marvelous group of 
shorts, the Svetz stories, titled THE 
FLIGHT OF THE HORSE. 

And, finally, pick up a book by a 
stranger (?) calling himself John Hol- 
brook Vance. The title is BAD 
RONALD. A smash. Or, as the main- 
stream would have it, a tour de force. 
This department cannot subscribe to 
the theory of the author that Ronald 
is a perfectly normal boy who went a 
little wrong. 

Anyway, buy it. Buy, buy, buy 
them all. Now that we're big and 
important we've got to sell a lot of 
books. 

See you for fun and games at Tor- 
con. BB 



It was far too light to be a solid 
body. To nobody’s great surprise, 
it was clear that Rama must be hol- 
low. 

The long-hoped, long-feared en- 
counter had come at last. Man- 
kind was about to receive its first 
visitor from the stars. 

II 

C OMMANDER NORTON re- 
membered the TV transmis- 
sions he had replayed so many 
times during the final minutes of 
the rendezvous. But there was one 
thing no electronic image could 
possibly convey — and that was 
Rama's overwhelming size. 

He had never received a similar 
impression when landing on a 
natural body. The moon and Mars 
were worlds, of course, and one ex- 
pected them to be big. But he had 
also landed on Jupiter VIII, 
which was slightly larger than 
Rama — and that had seemed quite 
a small object. 

To resolve the paradox was easy. 
His judgment was wholly altered 
by the fact that this was an artifact 
millions of times heavier than 
anything that man had ever put in- 
to space. The mass of Rama was at 
least ten million million tons — to 
any spaceman, that was not only 
an awe-inspiring but a terrifying 
thought. Norton knew a sense of 
insignificance, even depression, 
as that cylinder of sculptured and 
ageless metal filled more and 
more of the sky. 

There was also a sense of dan- 
ger here that was wholly novel to 
his experience. In every earlier 
landing he had known what to ex- 



12

pect — there was always the pos- 
sibility of accident, but never of 
surprise. With Rama surprise was 
the only certainty. 

Now Endeavor was hovering 
less than a thousand meters above 
the north pole of the cylinder, at 
the very center of the slowly turn- 
ing disk. This end had been chosen 
because it was the one in sunlight. 
The shadows of the short, enig- 
matic structures near the axis 
swept steadily across the metal 
plain as Rama rotated. The north- 
ern face of Rama was a gigantic 
sundial, measuring out the swift 
passage of its four-minute day. 

Landing a five-thousand-ton 
spaceship at the center of a spin- 
ning disk was the least of Com- 
mander Norton’s worries. The 
feat was no different from dock- 
ing at the axis of a large space sta- 
tion. Endeavor s lateral jets had 
already given her a matching 
spin and he could trust Lieutenant 
Joe Calvert to put her down as 
gently as a snowflake — with or 
without the aid of the computer. 

“In three minutes,” said Joe, 
without taking his eyes from the 
display, “we’ll know if it’s made of 
anti-matter.” 

Norton grinned as he recalled 
some of the more hair-raising 
theories about Rama’s origin. If 
the unlikely speculation Joe had 
referred to proved accurate, the 
next seconds would witness the 
biggest bang since the. solar sys- 
tem was formed. The total 
annihilation of ten thousand tons 
would, briefly, provide the plan- 
ets with the light of a second sun. 

Yet the mission profile had al- 
lowed for even this remote con- 



tingency and Endeavor had 
squirted Rama with one of her jets 
from a safe thousand kilometers 
away. Nothing whatsoever had 
happened when the expanding 
cloud of vapor had arrived on 
target; any matter/anti-matter 
reaction involving even a few 
milligrams would have produced 
an awesome fireworks display. 

Norton, like all space com- 
manders, was a cautious man. He 
had looked long and hard at the 
northern face of Rama before 
selecting the point of touchdown. 
After much thought he had de- 
cided to avoid the obvious 
spot — the exact center, the axis it- 
self. A clearly marked circular 
disk, a hundred meters in diam- 
eter, was centered on the pole and 
Norton had a strong suspicion 
that this must be the outer seal of 
an enormous airlock. The crea- 
tures who had built this hollow 
world must have had some way of 
taking their ships inside. This was 
the logical place for the main en- 
trance and Norton thought it 
might be unwise to block the front 
door with his own vessel. 

But this decision generated oth- 
er problems. If Endeavor touched 
down even a few meters from the 
axis Rama’s rapid spin would start 
her sliding away from the pole. At 
first the centrifugal force would be 
very weak, but it would be con- 
tinuous and inexorable. Com- 
mander Norton did not relish the 
thought of his ship slithering 
across the polar plain, gaining 
speed minute by minute until it 
was slung off into space at a thou- 
sand kilometers an hour. 

It was possible that Rama’s mi- 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



13 




nute gravitational field — about 
one thousandth of Earth’s — might 
prevent this from happening. It 
would hold Endavor against the 
plain with a force of several tons 
and if the surface proved suf- 
ficiently rough the ship might stay 
near the pole. But Norton had no 
intention of balancing an un- 
known frictional force against a 
quite certain centrifugal bne. 

Fortunately Rama’s designers 
had provided an answer. Equally 
spaced around the polar axis were 
three low, pillbox-shaped struc- 
tures about ten meters in diam- 
eter. If Endeavor touched down 
between any two of these the 
centrifugal drift would fetch her 
up against them and she would be 
held firmly in place, like a ship 
glued against a quay by the waves. 

“Contact in fifteen seconds,’’ 
said Joe. As he tensed himself 
above the duplicate controls, 
which he hoped he would not have 
to touch. Commander Norton be- 
came acutely aware of all that had 
come to focus on this instant of 
time. This, surely, was the most 
momentous landing since the first 
touchdown on the moon a cen- 
tury and a half ago. 

The gray pillboxes drifted slow- 
ly upward outside the control 
port. There was the last hiss of a 
reaction jet and a barely per- 
ceptible jar. 

In the weeks that had passed 
Commander Norton had often 
wondered what he would say at 
this moment. But now that it was 
upon him history chose his words 
and he spoke almost automatical- 
ly, barely aware of the echo from 
the past. 



'‘‘‘Rama Base. Endeavor has 
landed.’’ 



A S RECENTLY as a month 
ago he would never have be- 
lieved it possible. The ship had 
been on a routine mission, check- 
ing and emplacing asteroid 
warning beacons, when the order 
had come. Endeavor had been the 
only spacecraft in the solar sys- 
tem that could possibly make a 
rendezvous with the intruder be- 
fore it whipped around the sun and 
hurled itself back toward the 
stars. Even so it had been neces- 
sary to rob three other ships of the 
Solar Survey, which were now 
drifting helplessly until tankers 
could refuel them. Norton feared 
that it would be a long time before 
the skippers of Calypso, Beagle 
and Challenger would speak to 
him again. 

Even with all this extra propel- 
lant it had been a long, hard 
chase — Rama was already inside 
the orbit of Venus when Endeavor 
caught up with her. No other ship 
could have done so — this privilege 
was unique and not a moment of 
the weeks ahead was to be wasted. 
A thousand scientists on Earth 
would have cheerfully mortgaged 
their souls for this oppor- 
tunity — now they could only watch 
over the TV circuits, biting their 
lips and thinking how much bet- 
ter they could have done the job. 
But the inexorable laws of celes- 
tial mechanics had decreed that 
Endeavor was the first — and the 
last — of all man’s ships that would 
ever make contact with Rama. 

The advice he was continually

receiving from Earth did little to 
alleviate Norton’s responsibil- 
ity. If split-second decisions had 
to be made no one could help 
him — the radio time-lag to mis- 
sion control was already ten min- 
utes and increasing. He often en- 
vied the great navigators of the 
past, before the days of electronic 
communications, who could in- 
terpret their sealed orders with- 
out continual monitoring from 
headquarters. When they made 
mistakes no one ever knew. 

At the same time he was glad 
that some decisions could be dele- 
gated to Earth. Now that En- 
deavor’s orbit had coalesced with 
Rama's they were heading sun- 
ward like a single body. In forty 
days they would reach perihelion 
and pass within twenty million ki- 



lometers of the sun. That was far 
too close for comfort — long be- 
fore then. Endeavor would have to 
use her remaining fuel to nudge 
herself into a safer orbit. They 
would have perhaps three weeks of 
exploring time before they 
parted from Rama forever. 

After that the problem would be 
Earth’s. Endeavor would be 
virtually helpless, speeding on an 
orbit that could make her the first 
ship to reach the stars — in ap- 
proximately fifty thousand 
years. There was no need to wor- 
ry, mission control had prom- 
ised. Somehow, regardless of 
cost. Endeavor would be re- 
fueled — even if it proved necessary 
to send tankers after her and 
abandon them in space once they 
had transferred every gram of 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



15 




propellant. Rama was a prize 
worth any risk, short of a suicide 
mission. 

And, of course, it might even 
come to that. Commander Nor- 
ton had no illusions on this score. 
For the first time in a hundred 
years an element of total uncer- 
tainty had entered human af- 
fairs. Uncertainty was one thing 
that neither scientists nor poli- 
ticians could tolerate. If human 
sacrifice became the price of re- 
solving it — Endeavor and her 
crew would be expendable. 



R ama was silent as a tomb — 
which, perhaps, it was. En- 
deavor detected no radio signals 
on any frequency, no vibrations 
that the seismographs could pick 
up — apart from micro-tremors un- 
doubtedly caused by the sun’s in- 
creasing heat — no electrical cur- 
rents, no radioactivity. Rama was- 
almost ominously quiet — one 
might have expected that even an 
asteroid would be noisier. 

What did I expect? Norton 
asked himself. A committee of 
welcome? 

He was not sure whether to be 
disappointed or relieved. The 
initiative, at any rate, appeared 
up to him. 

His orders were to wait for 
twenty-four hours, then to go out 
and explore. Nobody slept much 
that first day — even the crew mem- 
bers not on duty spent their time 
monitoring the ineffectually 
probing instruments or simply 
looking through the observation 
ports at the starkly geometrical 
landscape. Was this world alive? 



Was it dead? Or was it merely 
sleeping? 

On the first EVA, Norton 
took only one companion — Karl 
Mercer, his tough and resourceful 
life-support officer. He had no in- 
tention of getting out of sight of 
the ship and if any trouble arose it 
was unlikely that a larger party 
would be safer. As a precaution, 
however, he had two more crew 
members suited and standing by 
in the airlock. 

The few grams of weight that 
Rama’s combined gravitational 
and centrifugal fields gave the ex- 
plorers were neither help nor 
hindrance — they had to rely en- 
tirely on their jets. As soon as pos- 
sible, Norton told himself, he 
w'ould string guide ropes between 
the ship and the pillboxes, so that 
they could move around without 
wasting propellants. 

The nearest pillbox was only ten 
meters from the airlock and Nor- 
ton’s first concern was to check 
that the contact had caused no 
damage to the ship. Endeavor's 
hull was resting against the curv- 
ing wall with a thrust of several 
tons, but the pressure was evenly 
distributed. Reassured, he began 
to drift around the circular struc- 
ture, trying to determine its pur- 
pose. 

He had traveled only a few 
meters when he came across an in- 
terruption in the smooth, appar- 
ently metallic wall. At first he 
thought it was some peculiar 
decoration, for it seemed to serve 
no useful function. Six radial 
grooves — or slots — were deeply 
recessed in the metal and lying in 
them were six crossed bars like the 



16 



GALAXY 




spokes of a rimless wheel, with a 
small hub at the center. But there 
was no way in which the wheel 
could be turned — it was embedded 
in the wall. 

Then he noticed, with growing 
excitement, that there were 
deeper recesses at the ends of the 
spokes nicely shaped to accept a 
clutching hand. Claw? Tentacle? 
If one stood braced against the wall 
and pulled on the spokes so . 

Smooth as silk the wheel slid out 
of the wall. To his utter astonish- 
ment — for he had been virtually 
certain that any moving parts 
would have become vacuum- 
welded ages ago — Norton found 
himself holding a spoked wheel. 
He might have been the captain of 
some old windjammer standing 
at the helm of his ship. 

He was glad that his helmet sun- 
shade did not allow Mercer to read 
his expression. 

He was startled, but also angry 
with himself — perhaps he had al- 
ready made his first mistake. 
Were alarms now sounding inside 
Rama and had his thoughtless ac- 
tion already triggered some im- 
placable mechanism? 

But Endeavor reported no 
change. Its sensors still detected 
nothing except faint thermal 
crepitations and his own move- 
ments. 

“Well, skipper — are you going 
to turn it?” 

Norton thought once more of his 
instructions. Use your own dis- 
cretion, but proceed with cau- 
tion. If he checked every single 
move with mission control he 
would never get anywhere. 

“What’s your diagnosis, Karl?” 



“It’s obviously a manual con- 
trol for an airlock — probably an 
emergency backup system in 
case of power failure. I can’t 
imagine any technology, how- 
ever advanced, that wouldn’t take 
such precautions.” 

“And it has to be fail-safe,” 
Norton decided out loud. “So 
that it can only be operated if 
there’s no possible danger to the 
system.” 

He grasped two opposing spokes 
of the windlass, braced his feet and 
tested the wheel. It did not budge. 

“Give me a hand,” he asked 
Mercer. Each took a spoke. Exert- 
ing their utmost strength, they 
were unable to produce the slight- 
est movement. 

Of course, there was no reason 
to suppose that clocks and cork- 
screws on Rama turned in the same 
direction as they did on Earth. 

“Let’s try the other way,” sug- 
gested Mercer. 

This time there was no resis- 
tance. The wheel rotated easily 
through a full circle. Then, 
smoothly, it took up the load. 

Half *a meter away the curving 
wall of the pillbox started to move 
like a slowly opening clamshell. 
A few particles of dust, driven by 
wisps of escaping air, streamed 
outward like dazzling diamonds 
as the brilliant sunlight caught 
them. 

The road to Rama lay open. 



Ill 

I T HAD been a serious mistake. 
Dr. Bose often thought, to put 
the United Planets Headquarters 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



17 




on the moon. Inevitably Earth 
tended to dominate the proceed- 
ings— as it dominated the land- 
scape beyond the dome. If they 
had had to build here perhaps they 
should have gone to Farside, 
where that hypnotic globe never 
showed itself. 

But it was much too late to 
change things now — and in any 
case no real alternative existed. 
Whether the colonies liked it or 
not Earth would be the cultural 
and economic overlord of the 
solar system for centuries to 
come. 

Dr. Bose had been born on Earth 
and had not emigrated to Mars 
until he was thirty, so he felt that 
he could view the political situa- 
tion fairly dispassionately. He 
knew now that he would never re- 
turn to his home planet, even 
though it was only five hours away 
by shuttle. At one hundred and 
fifteen he was in perfect health, 
but he could not face the recondi- 
tioning needed to accustom him 
to three times the gravity he had 
enjoyed for most of his life. He 
was exiled forever from the world 
of his birth. Since he was not a sen- 
timental man this had never de- 
pressed him unduly. 

What did depress him some- 
times was the need for dealing, 
year after year, with the same fa- 
miliar faces. The marvels of 
medicine were all very well and 
certainly he had no desire to put 
back the clock — but there were 
men around this conference table 
with whom he had worked for 
more than half a century. He knew 
exactly what each would say and 
how each would vote on any given 



subject. He wished that, some day, 
one of them would do something 
totally unexpected — even some- 
thing quite crazy. 

And probably they felt exactly 
the same way about him. 

The Rama Committee was still 
manageably small, though doubt- 
less that would soon be rectified. 
His six colleagues — the U.P. re- 
presentatives for Mercury, 
Earth, Luna, Ganymede, Titan 
and Triton — were all present in 
the flesh. They had to be — elec- 
tronic diplomacy was not pos- 
sible over solar .system distances. 
Some elder statesmen, accus- 
tomed to the instantaneous com- 
munications which Earth had 
long taken for granted, had never 
reconciled’ themselves to the fact 
that radio waves took min- 
utes — even hours — to journey 
across the gulfs between the plan- 
ets. “Can’t you scientists do some- 
thing about it?” they had been 
heard to complain bitterly when 
told that face-to-face conversa- 
tion was impossible between 
Earth and its remoter children. 
Only the moon had that barely ac- 
ceptable one-and-a-half-second 
delay — with all the political and 
psychological consequences 
such proximity implied. Be- 
cause of this fact of astronomi- 
cal life the moon — and only the 
moon — would always be a suburb 
of Earth. 

Also present in person were 
some of the specialists who had 
been co-opted to the committee. 
Professor Davidson, the astron- 
omer, was an old acquain- 
tance-today he did not .seem his 
usual irascible self. Dr. Bose knew 



18 



GALAXY 




nothing of the infighting that had 
preceded the launch of the first 
probe to Rama, but the profes- 
sor’s colleagues had not let him 
forget it. 

Dr. Thelma Price was familiar 
through her numerous television 
appearances, though she had first 
made her reputation fifty years 
ago during the archeological 
explosion that had followed the 
draining of that vast marine mus- 
eum, the Mediterranean. 

Dr. Bose could still recall the 
excitement of that time, when the 
lost treasures of the Greeks, 
Romans and a dozen other civili- 
zations were restored to the light 
of day. That was one of the few oc- 
casions when he was sorry to be 
living on Mars. 

The exobiologist, Carlisle 
Perera, was another obvious 
choice — so was Dennis Solomons, 
the science historian. Dr. Bose 
was slightly less happy about the 
presence of Conrad Taylor, the 
celebrated anthropologist, who 
had made his reputation by 
uniquely combining scholarship 
and crotocism in his study of pub- 
erty rites in Late twentieth-century 
Beverly Hills. 

No one, however, could possibly 
have disputed the right of Sir 
Lewis Sands to be on the commit- 
tee. A man whose knowledge was 
matched only by his urbanity. Sir 
Lewis was reputed to lose his com- 
posure only when called the Ar- 
nold Toynbee of his age. 

The great historian was not 
present in person — he stubbornly 
refused to leave Earth even for so 
momentous a meeting as this. His 
stereo image, indistinguishable

from reality, apparently occu- 
pied the chair to Dr. Bose’s right. 
As if to complete the illusion 
someone had placed a glass of 
water in front of him. Dr. Bose 
considered that this sort of tech- 
nological tour-de-force was an un- 
necessary gimmick, but it was 
surprising how many unde- 
niably great men were childishly 
delighted to be in two places at 
once. Sometimes this electronic 
miracle produced comic disas- 
ters — he had been at one diplo- 
matic reception where somebody 
had tried to walk through a stereo- 
gram and discovered, too late, 
that it was the real person. And it 
was even funnier to watch projec- 
tions trying to shake hands. 

H IS Excellency the Ambas- 
sador for Mars to the United 
Planets called his wandering 
thoughts to order, cleared his 
throat and said, “Gentlemen, the 
committee is now in session. 1 
think I’m correct in saying that 
this is a gathering of unique tal- 
ents, assembled to deal with a 
unique situation. The directive 
that the secretary general has 
given us is to evaluate that situa- 
tion and to advise Commander 
Norton when necessary.” 

This was a miracle of oversim- 
plification and everyone knew 
it. Unless there was a real emer- 
gency, the committee might never 
be in direct contact with Com- 
mander Norton — if, indeed, he 
had ever heard of it. For the 
committee was a temporary 
creation of the United Planet’s 
Science Organization, report- 
ing through its director to the sec- 



retary general. In theory, how- 
ever, there was no reason why the 
Rama Committee — or anyone 
else for that matter — should not 
call up Commander Norton and 
offer helpful advice. 

But deep space communica- 
tions are expensive. Endeavor 
could be contacted only through 
PLANETCOM, an autonomous 
corporation famous for the 
strictness and efficiency of its ac- 
counting. It took a long time to 
establish a line of credit with 
PLANETCOM. Somewhere some- 
one was working on this, but at the 
moment planetcom's hard- 
hearted computers did not recog- 
nize the existence of the Rama 
Committee. 

“This Commander Norton," 
said the ambassador for Earth. 
“He has a tremendous responsi- 
bility. What sort of person is he?” 

“1 can answer that,” said Pro- 
fessor Davidson, his fingers fly- 
ing over the keyboard of his mem- 
ory pad. He frowned at the screen- 
ful of information and started to 
make an instant synopsis. 

“William Tsien Norton, born

“Wife?" asked Taylor inno- 
cently. 

“No, child of course," snapped 
the professor, before he caught 
the grin on the other’s face. Mild 
laughter rippled around the table, 
though the overcrowded terres- 
trials looked more envious than 
amused. After a century of de- 
termined effort Earth had still 
failed to get its population below 
the target of one billion. 

“ — appointed commanding of- 
ficer Solar Survey Research Ves- 
sel Endeavor. First voyage to 
retrograde satellites of Jupiter 
. um, that was a tricky one . 
on asteroid mission when ordered 
to prepare for this operation. Man- 
aged to beat deadline — " 

The professor cleared the dis- 
play and looked at his colleagues. 

“I think we were extremely 
lucky, considering that he was 
the only man available at such 
short notice. We might have had 
the usual run-of-the-mill captain." 

“The record only proves that 
he’s competent," objected the 
representative from Mercury 
(Population; 112,500 but grow- 
ing). “How will he react in a wholly 
novel situation like this?" 

On Earth Sir Lewis Sands 
cleared his throat. A second and a 
half later he did so on the moon. 

“Not exactly a novel situation," 
he reminded the Hermian. “even 
though it’s three centuries since it 
last occurred. If Rama is dead, or 
unoccupied — and so far all the 
evidence suggests that it is — Nor- 
ton is in the position of an archeo- 
logist discovering the ruins of an 
extinct culture." He bowed po- 
litely to Dr. Price, who nodded in 



agreement. “Obvious examples 
are Schliemann at Troy or 
Mouhot at Angkor Vat. The dan- 
ger is minimal, though of course 
accident can never be completely 
ruled out." 

“But what about the booby-traps 
and trigger mechanisms these 
Pandora people have been talk- 
ing about?” asked Dr. Price. 

“Pandora?” asked the Her- 
mian quickly. “What’s that?” 

“It’s a crackpot movement of 
people who are convinced that 
Rama is a grave potential danger. 
A box that shouldn’t be opened, 
you know.” 

“Pandora — paranoia” snorted 
Conrad Taylor. “Oh, such things 
are conceivable, but why should 
any intelligent race want to play 
childish tricks?” 

“Well, even ruling out such un- 
pleasantness,” Sir Lewis contin- 
ued, “we still have the much more 
ominous possibility of an active, 
inhabited Rama. Then the situa- 
tion is one of an encounter be- 
tween two cultures — at very dif- 
ferent technological levels. 
Pizarro and the Incas. Peary and 
the Japanese. Europe and Africa. 
Almost invariably, the conse- 
quences have been disastrous — for 
one or both parties. I’m not mak- 
ing any recommendations — I’m 
merely pointing out precedents.” 

“Thank you, Sir Lewis,” re- 
plied Dr. Bose. “I’m sure we’ve all 
thought of these alarming possi- 
bilities. But if the creatures in- 
side Rama are malevolent — will it 
really make the slightest differ- 
ence what we do?” 

“They might ignore us if we go 
away.” 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



21 




“What? After they’ve traveled 
billions of miles and thousands of 
years?" 

The argument had reached the 
take-off point and was now self- 
sustaining. Dr. Bose sat back in 
his chair, said very little and 
waited for the consensus to 
emerge. 

It was just as he had predicted. 
Everyone agreed that, once he had 
opened the first door, it wa^ incon- 
ceivable that Commander Nor- 
ton should not open the second. 

IV 

I F HIS wives ever compared his 
videograms, Commandor Nor- 
ton thought with more amusement 
than concern, it would involve 
him in a lot of extra work. Now he 
could make one long ’gram and 
dupe it, adding only brief personal 
messages and endearments be- 
fore shooting almost identical 
copies off to Mars and Earth. 

It was, of course, highly un- 
likely that his wives would ever 
check with each other — even at 
the concessionary rates allowed 
to spacemen’s families such 
communication would be -•ex- 
pensive. And there would be no 
point in it. His families were on 
excellent terms with each other 
and exchanged the usual greetings 
on birthdays and anniversaries. 
Yet, on the whole, perhaps it was 
Just as well that the girls had never 
met and probably never would. 
Myrna had been born on Mars and 
so could not tolerate the high 
gravity of Earth. And Caroline 
hated even the twenty-five minutes 
of the longest possible terrestrial 



air journey — which made the long 
trip to Mars unfeasible for her. 

“Sorry I’m a day late with this 
transmission,’’ said the com- 
mander after he had finished the 
general-purpose preliminaries, 
“but I’ve been away from the ship 
for the last thirty hours, believe it 
or not. 

“Don’t be alarmed — everything 
is under control, going per- 
fectly. It’s taken us two days, but 
we’re almost through the airlock 
complex. We could have done it in 
a couple of hours if we'd known 
what we know now. But we took no 
chances, sent remote cameras 
ahead and cycled all the locks a 
dozen times to make sure they 
wouldn't seize up behind us after 
we’d gone through. 

“Each lock is a simple revolving 
cylinder with a slot on one side. 
You go in through this opening, 
crank the cylinder around a hun- 
dred eighty degrees — and the slot 
then matches up with another 
door so you can step out of it. Or 
float, in this case. 

“The Ramans really made sure 
of things. There are three of these 
cylinder locks, one after the oth- 
er, just inside the outer hull. 1 
can’t imagine how even one would 
fail unless someone blew it up 
with explosives, but if it did there 
would be a second backup and 
then a third. 

“And that’s only the beginning. 
The final lock opens into a 
straight corridor, almost half a 
kilometer long. It looks clean and 
tidy like everything else we’ve 
seen. Every few meters there are 
small ports that probably held 
lights, but now everything is com-

pletely black and, I don't mind 
telling you, scary. There are also 
two parallel slots, about a centi- 
meter wide, cut in the walls and 
running the whole length of the 
tunnel. We suspect that some 
kind of shuttle runs inside these, 
to tow equipment — or people — 
back and forth. It would save us a 
lot of trouble if we could get it 
working. 

“1 mentioned that the tunnel 
was half a kilometer long. Well, 
from our seismic soundings we 
know that's about the thickness of 
the shell, so obviously we were al- 
most through it. And at the end of 
tunnel we weren't surprised to 
find another of those cylindri- 
cal airlocks. 

“Yes, and another. And an- 
other. These people seem to have 
done everything in threes. We're 
in the final lock chamber now\ 
waiting for the okay from Earth 
before we go through. The inter- 
ior of Rama is only a few meters 
away. I'll be a lot happier when 
the suspense is over. 

“You know Jerry Kirchoff, my 
exec, who's got such a library of 
real books that he can't afford to 
emigrate from Earth? Well, Jerry 
told me about a situation just like 
this back at the beginning of the 
twenty-first -no, twentieth cen- 
tury. An archeologist found the 
tomb of an Egyptian king, the first 
one that hadn't been looted by 
robbers. His workmen took 
months to dig their way in, 
chamber by chamber, until they 
came to the final wall. Then they 
broke through the masonry and he 
held out a lantern and pushed his 
head inside. He found himself

looking into a whole roomful of 
treasure — incredible stuff, gold 
and jewels. 

“Perhaps this place is also a 
tomb — that seems more and more 
likely. Even now there's still not 
the slightest sound or hint of any 
activity. Well, tomorrow we 
should know." 

Commander Norton switched 
the recorder to hold. What else, 
he wondered, should he say about 
the work before he began the 
separate personal messages to 
his families? Normally he never 
went into so much detail, but these 
circumstances were scarcely nor- 
mal. This might be the last 'gram 
he would ever send to those he 
loved — he owed it to them to ex- 
plain what he was doing. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



23 




By the time they saw these 
images and heard these words, he 
would be inside Rama — for bet- 
ter or for worse. 



N ever before had Norton felt 
so strongly his kinship with 
that long-dead Egyptologist. Not 
since Howard Carter had peered 
into the tomb of Tutankhamen 
could any man have known a mo- 
ment such as this — yet the com- 
parison was almost laughably 
ludicrous. 

Tutankhamen had been buried 
only yesterday — not even four 
thousand years ago — and Rama 
might be older than mankind. 
That little tomb in the Valley of 
the Kings could have been lost in 
the corridors through which they 
had already passed, yet the space 
that lay beyond this final seal was 
many times greater. And as for the 
treasure it might hold — that was 
beyond imagination. 

No one had spoken over the 
radio circuits for at least five min- 
utes — the well-trained team had 
not even reported verbally when 
all the checks were complete. 
Mercer had simply given him the 
sign and waved him toward the 
open tunnel. It was as if everyone 
realized that this was a moment 
for history, not to be spoiled by 
unnecessary small talk. That 
suited Commander Norton, for 
at the moment he, too, had noth- 
ing to say. He flicked on the beam 
of his flashlight, triggered his jets 
and drifted slowly down the corri- 
dor, trailing his safety line behind 
him. Only seconds later he was in- 
side. 



Inside what? All before him 
was total darkness not a glim- 
mer of light was reflected back 
from the beam. He had expected 
this, but he had not really be- 
lieved it. All the calculations had 
shown that the far wall was tens of 
kilometers away — now' his eyes 
told him that this was indeed the 
truth. As he drifted slowly into 
darkness he felt a sudden need for 
the reassurance of his safety line, 
a stronger such feeling than he had 
ever experienced before, even on 
his very first EVA. And that was 
ridiculous — he had looked out 
across the light-years and the 
megaparsecs without vertigo. 
Why should he be disturbed by a 
few cubic kilometers of empti- 
ness? 

He was still queasily brooding 
over this problem when the mo- 
mentum damper at the end of the 
line braked him gently to a halt 
with a barely perceptible re- 
bound. He swept the beam of the 
flashlight down to examine the 
surface from which he had 
emerged. 

He might have been hovering 
over the center of a small 
crater- -which was itself a dimple 
in the base of a much larger one. 
On either side rose a complex of 
terraces and ramps — all geomet- 
rically precise — which extended 
for as far as the beam could reach. 
About a hundred meters away he 
could see the exits of two other 
airlock systems identical with 
this one. 

And that was all. He noted noth- 
ing particularly exotic or alien 
about the .scene- in fact, it bore a 
considerable resemblance to an 



24 



GALAXY 




abandoned mine. Norton felt a 
vague sense of disappointment. 
After all this effort there should 
have been some dramatic, even 
transcendental revelation. Then he 
reminded himself that he could see 
only a couple of hundred meters. 
The darkness beyond his field of 
view might yet contain more won- 
ders than he cared to face. 

He reported briefly to his anx- 
iously waiting companions, then 
added; “Tm sending out the flare 
— two-minute delay. Here goes.” 

With all his strength he threw 
the little cylinder upward and out 
and started to count seconds as it 
dwindled along the beam. Before 
he had reached the quarter-min- 
ute it was out of sight. When he 
had come to a hundred he shielded 
his eyes and aimed the camera. He 
had always been good at esti- 
mating time. He was only two sec- 
onds off when the world exploded 
with light. And this time there was 
no cause for disappointment. 



E ven the millions of candle- 
power of the Hare could not 
light up the middle of this enor- 
mous cavity, but now he could see 
enough to grasp its plan and ap- 
preciate its titanic scale. He was 
at one end of a hollow cylinder at 
least ten kilometers wide and of 
indefinite length. From^ his view- 
point at the central axis he could 
see such a mass of detail on the 
curving walls surrounding him 
that his mind could not absorb 
more than a minute fraction of 
it— he was looking at the land- 
scape of an entire world by a 
single Hash of lightning. He tried 



by a deliberate effort of will to 
freeze the image in his mind. 

All around him the terraced 
slopes of crater reared up until 
they merged into the solid wall that 
rimmed the sky. No — that impres- 
sion was false. He must discard 
the instincts both of Earth and of 
space and reorientate himself to 
a new system of coordinates. 

He was not at the lowest point of 
this strange, inside-out world, but 
the highest. From here, all direc- 
tions were down, not up. If he 
moved away from this central axis 
and toward the curving wall 
— which he must no longer 
think of as a wall — gravity would 
steadily increase. When he 
reached the inside surface of the 
cylinder, he could stand upright 
on it at any point, feet toward the 
stars and head toward the center 
of the spinning drum. The con- 
cept was familiar enough — from 
the earliest dawn of spaceflight 
centrifugal force had been used to 
simulate gravity. It was only the 
scale of this application that was 
so overwhelming, so shocking. 
The largest of all space stations, 
Syncsat Five, was less than two 
hundred meters in diameter. It 
would take some little while to 
grow accustomed to one a hun- 
dred times that size. 

The tube of landscape that en- 
closed him was mottled with areas 
of light and shade that could have 
been forests, fields, frozen lakes 
or towns — the distance and the 
fading illuminations of the flare 
made identification impos- 
sible. Narrow lines that could be 
highways, canals, or well-trained 
rivers formed a faintly visible geo-

metric network and, far along the 
cylinder, at the very limit of vis- 
ion, was a band of deeper dark- 
ness. It formed a complete circle, 
ringing the interior of this world, 
and Norton suddenly recalled 
the myth of Oceanus, the sea 
which, the ancients believed, sur- 
rounded the Earth. 

Here, perhaps, was an even 
stranger sea — not circular, but 
cylindrical. Before it became fro- 
zen in the interstellar night, did it 
have waves and tides and cur- 
rents — and fish? 

The flare guttered and died. The 
moment of revelation was over. 
But Norton knew that as long as 
he lived these images would be 
burned in his mind. Whatever dis- 
coveries the future might bring, 
they could never erase this first im- 
pression. And history could never 
take from him the privilege of hav- 
ing been the first of all mankind to 
gaze upon the works of an alien 
civilization. 

V 

44VT^E HAVE now launched 
Tt five long-delay flares down 
the axis of the cylinder and so 
have a good photo coverage of its 
full length. All the main features 
are mapped. Though there are very 
few that we can identify, we’ve 
given them provisional names. 

“The interior cavity is fifty 
kilometers long and sixty wide. 
The two ends are bowl-shaped, 
with rather complicated geo- 
metries. We've called ours the 
Northern Hemisphere and are es- 
tablishing our first base here at 
the axis. 



“Radiating away from the cen- 
tral hub and one hundred and 
twenty degrees apart, are three 
ladders that are almost a kilo- 
meter long. They all end at a ter- 
race or ring-shaped plateau that 
runs right around the bowl. And 
leading on from that, continuing 
the direction of the ladders, are 
three enormous stairways, which 
go all the way down to the plain. If 
you imagine an umbrella with 
only three ribs, equally spaced, 
you’ll have a good idea of this end 
of Rama. 

“Each of those ribs is a stair- 
way, very steep near the axis and 
then slowly flattening out as it ap- 
proaches the plain below. The 
stairways — we’ve called them 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma — aren’t 
continuous, but break at five 
more circular terraces. We esti- 
mate there must be between 
twenty and thirty thousand steps. 
Presumably the stairs were only 
used for emergencies, since it’s in- 
conceivable that the Ramans — or 
whatever we’re going to call 
them — had no better way of 
reaching the axis of their world. 

“The Southern Hemisphere 
looks quite different. For one 
thing, it has no stairways and no 
flat central hub. Instead, there’s a 
huge spike — kilometers long — ^jut- 
ting along the axis, with six small- 
er ones around it. The whole ar- 
rangement is very odd and we can’t 
imagine what it means. 

“The fifty-kilometer-long cylin- 
drical section between the two 
bowls we’ve called the Central 
Plain. It may seem crazy to use the 
word ‘plain’ to describe some- 
thing so obviously curved, but we 



26 



GALAXY 




feel it’s justified. It will appear 
flat to us when we get down 
there — just as the interior of a 
large bottle must seem flat to an 
ant crawling around inside it. 

“The most striking feature of 
the Central Plain is the ten-kilo- 
meter-wide dark band running 
completely around it at the half- 
way mark. It looks like ice, so 
we’ve christened it The Cylindrical 
Sea. Right out in the middle of it is 
a large oval island, about ten kilo- 
meters long and three wide and 
covered with tall structures. Be- 
cause it reminds us of Old Man- 
hattan, we’ve called it New York. 
Yet I don't think it’s a city — it 
seems more like an enormous 
factory or chemical processing 
plant. 

“But there are some cities— or 
towns — at least six of them. If they 
were built for human beings they 
could each hold about fifty thou- 
sand people. We’ve called them 
Rome, Peking, Paris, Moscow, 
London, Tokyo. They are linked 
with highways and something 
that seems to be a rail system. 

“There must be enough materi- 
al for centuries of research in 
this frozen carcass of a world and 
we've only a few weeks to do the 
job. I wonder if we'll ever learn the 
answer to the two mysteries that 
have been haunting me ever since 
we got inside; who were they — and 
what went wrong?’’ 



T he recording ended. On Earth 
and moon the members of the 
Rama Committee relaxed, then 
started to examine the maps and 
photographs spread in front of 



them. Though they had already 
studied these for many hours. 
Commander Norton’s voice 
added a dimension no pictures 
could convey. He had actually 
been there — had looked with his 
own eyes across this extraordin- 
ary inside-out world, during the 
brief moments its age-long night 
had been illuminated by the 
flares. And he was the man who 
would lead any expedition to ex- 
plore it. 

“Dr. Perera, 1 believe you have 
some comments to make?’’ 

Dr. Bose wondered briefly if he 
should have first given the floor to 
Professor Davidson, the senior 
scientist and the only astron- 
omer. But the old cosmologist 
still seemed to be in a mild state of 
shock and was clearly out of his 
element. All his professional ca- 
reer he had looked upon the uni- 
verse as an arena for the titanic 
impersonal forces of gravita- 
tion, magnetism and radia- 
tion — he had never believed that 
life played an important role in 
the scheme of things and regarded 
its appearance on Earth, Mars 
and Jupiter as an accidental 
aberration. 

But now there was proof that life 
not only existed outside the solar 
system, but had scaled heights far 
beyond anything that man had 
achieved or could hope to reach for 
centuries to come. Moreover, the 
discovery of Rama challenged 
another dogma that the profes- 
sor had preached for years. When 
pressed, he would reluctantly ad- 
mit that life probably did exist in 
other star systems— but it was ab- 
surd, he had always maintained. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



27 




to imagine that it could ever cross 
the interstellar gulfs. 

Perhaps the Ramans had in- 
deed failed — if Commander Nor- 
ton proved correct in believing 
that their world was now a tomb. 
But at least they had attempted 
the feat on a scale that had at the 
outset indicated a high confi- 
dence in the outcome. If such a 
thing had happened once it must 
surely have happened many times 
in this galaxy of a hundred thou- 
sand million suns — and someone, 
somewhere, would eventually 
succeed. 

This was the thesis which, with- 
out proof but with considerable 
arm-waving. Dr. Carlisle Perera 
had been preaching for years. He 
was now a very happy man, though 
also a most frustrated one. Rama 
had spectacularly confirmed his 
views — but he could never set foot 
inside it or even see it with his own 
eyes. If the devil had suddenly ap- 
peared and offered him the gift of 
instantaneous teleportation he 
would have signed the contract 
without bothering to look at the 
small print. 

“Yes, Mr. Ambassador, 1 
think I have some information of 
interest. What we have here is un- 
doubtedly a Space Ark. It’s an old 
idea in astronautical litera- 
ture — I’ve been able to trace it 
back to the British physicist J.D. 
Bernal, who proposed this 
method of interstellar coloniza- 
tion in a book published in nine- 
teen twenty-nine — yes, two hun- 
dred years ago! And the great Rus- 
sian pioneer Tsiolkovski put for- 
ward somewhat similar propos- 
als even earlier. 



“If you want to go from one star 
system to another you have a 
number of choices. Assuming 
that the speed of light is an abso- 
lute limit — and that’s still not com- 
pletely settled, despite anything 
you may have heard to the con- 
trary — ’’ there was an indignant 
sniff, but no formal protest from 
Professor Davidson — “you can 
make a fast trip in a small vessel 
or a slow journey in a giant one. 

“There seems no technical rea- 
son why spacecraft cannot reach 
ninety percent or more of the 
speed of light. That would mean a 
travel time of five to ten years be- 
tween neighboring stars — ted- 
ious, perhaps, but not impracti- 
cal, especially for creatures 
whose life-spans might be mea- 
sured in centuries. One can ima- 
gine voyages of this duration car- 
ried out in ships not much larger 
than ours. 

“But perhaps such speeds are 
impossible with reasonable pay- 
loads — remember, you have to 
carry the fuel to slow down at the 
end of the voyage, even if you’re 
on a one-way trip. So it may make 
more sense to take your tirtie — ten 
thousand or a hundred thousand 
years. 

“Bernal and others thought this 
could be done with mobile world- 
lets a few kilometers across, carry- 
ing thousands of passengers on 
journeys that would last for gen- 
erations. Naturally the system 
would have to be rigidly closed, re- 
cycling all food, air and other ex- 
pendables. But, of course, that’s 
just how the Earth operates — on a 
slightly larger scale. 

“Some writers suggested that 



28 



GALAXY 




these Space Arks should be built in 
the form of concentric spheres. 
Others proposed hollow, spin- 
ning cylinders so that centrifu- 
gal force could provide artificial 
gravity — exactly what we’ve found 
in Rama — " 

P ROFESSOR DAVIDSON 
could not tolerate this sloppy 
talk. 

“No such thing as centrifugal 
force. It's an engineer’s phan- 
tom. There’s only inertia.” 

“You’re quite right, of course,” 
admitted Perera, “though it 
might be hard to convince a man 
who’d just been slung off a car- 
ousel. But mathematical rigor 
seems unnecessary — ” 

“Hear, hear,” interjected Dr. 
Bose with some exasperation. 
“We all know what you mean, or 
think we do. Please don’t destroy 
our illusions.” 

“Well, 1 was merely pointing out 
that there’s nothing conceptually 
novel about Rama, though its size 
is startling. Men had imagined 
such things for two hundred years. 
Now I’d like to address myself to 
another question. Exactly how 
long has Rama been traveling 
through space? 

“We now have a very precise 
determination of its orbit and 
its velocity. Assuming that it’s 
made no navigational changes, 
we can trace its position back for 
millions of years. We expected 
that any visitor would be coming 
from the direction of a nearby 
star — but that isn’t the ca.se here at 
all. 

“It’s more than two hundred 
thousand years since Rama passed 



near a star and that particular one 
turns out to be an irregular varia- 
ble — about the most unsuitable 
sun you could imagine for an in- 
habited solar system. It has a 
brightness range of over fifty to 
one — any planets would be alter- 
nately baked and frozen every few 
years.” 

“A suggestion,” put in Dr. 
Price. “Perhaps that explains 
everything. Maybe this was once 
a normal sun and became un- 
stable. That’s why the Ramans had 
to find a new one.” 

Dr. Perera admired the old 
archeologist, so he let her down 
lightly. What would she say, he 
wondered, if he started pointing 
out the instantly obvious in her 
own specialty? 

“We did consider that,” he said 
gently. “But if our present theories 
of stellar evolution are correct 
this star could never have been 
stable — could never have had life- 
bearing planets. So Rama has been 
cruising through space for at least 
two hundred thousand years — and 
perhaps for more than a million. 

“Now it’s cold and dark and ap- 
parently dead — and I think I 
know why. The Ramans may have 
had no choice — perhaps they were 
indeed fleeing from some disas- 
ter — but they miscalculated. 

“No closed ecology can be one 
hundred percent efficient. There 
is always waste, loss — some 
degradation of the environment 
and build-up of pollutants. It may 
take billions of years to poison 
and wear out a planet — but it will 
happen in the end. The oceans dry 
up. The atmosphere will leak 
away. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



29 




“By our standards Rama is 
enormous — yet it is still a very 
tiny planet. My calculations, 
based on the leakage through its 
hull and some reasonable guesses 
about the rate of biological turn- 
over, indicate that its ecology 
could survive only about a 
thousand years. At the most I’ll 
grant ten thousand. 

“That would be long enough, at 
the speed Rama is traveling, for a 
transit between the closely 
packed suns in the heart of the'gal- 
axy. But not out here, in the scat- 
tered population of the spiral 
arms. Rama is a ship that ex- 
hausted its provisions before it 
reached its goal. It’s a derelict, 
drifting among the stars. 

“There’s just one serious objec- 
tion to this theory and I’ll raise it 
before anybody else does. Rama’s 
orbit is aimed so accurately at 
the solar system that coincidence 
seems ruled out. In fact. I’d say it’s 
now heading much too close to the 
sun for comfort. Endeavor will 
have to break away long before 
perihelion to avoid overheating. 

“I don’t pretend to understand 
this. Perhaps some form of auto- 
matic terminal guidance is still 
operating, steering Rama to the 
nearest suitable star ages after its 
builders are dead. 

“And they are dead — I’ll stake 
my reputation on that. All the 
samples we’ve taken from the in- 
terior are absolutely sterile — we’ve 
not found a single micro-organism. 
As for the talk you may have 
heard about suspended animation, 
you can ignore it. There are funda- 
mental reasons why hibernation 
techniques will work for only a 



very few centuries — and we’re deal- 
ing with time spans a thousandfold 
longer. 

“So the Pandorans and their 
sympathizers have nothing to 
worry about. For my part. I’m 
sorry. It would have been wonder- 
ful to have met another intelli- 
gent species. 

“But at least we have answered 
one ancient question. We are not 
alone. The stars will never again be 
the same to us.’’ 



VI 

OMMANDER NORTON 
was sorely tempted — but, as 
captain, his first duty was to his 
ship. If anything went badly 
wrong on this initial probe he 
might have to retreat the vessel. 

So that left his second officer, 
Mercer, the obvious choice. Nor- 
ton willingly admitted that Karl 
was better suited for the mission. 

An authority on life-support 
systems, Mercer had written 
some of the standard texts on the 
subject. He had personally 
checked out innumerable types 
of equipment, often under 
hazardous conditions, and his 
biofeedback control was fa- 
mous. At a moment’s notice he 
could cut his pulse rate by fifty per- 
cent and reduce respiration to al- 
most zero for up to ten minutes. 
This useful little trick had saved 
his life on more than one occasion. 

Yet, despite his great ability and 
intelligence, he was almost wholly 
lacking in imagination. 

To him the most dangerous ex- 
periments or missions were sim- 




30 



GALAXY 




ply jobs that had to be done. He 
never took unnecessary risks and 
had no use at all for what was com- 
monly regarded as courage. 

The two mottos on his desk 
summed up his philosophy of life. 
One asked what have you for- 
gotten? The other said help 
STAMP OUT bravery. The fact that 
he was widely regarded as the 
bravest man in the fleet was the 
only thing that ever made him an- 
gry. 

Given Mercer, the selection of 
the next man was automatic. 
Lieutenant Joe Calvert was Mer- 
cer’s inseparable companion. It 
was hard to see what the two had in 
common — the lightly built, rather 
highly strung navigating officer 
was ten years younger than his 
stolid and imperturbable friend, 
who certainly did not share Joe’s 
passionate interest in the art of 
primitive cinerna. 

But no one can predict where the 
lightning will strike and years ago 
Mercer and Calvert had estab- 
lished an apparently stable part- 
nership. That was common enough 
— much more unusual was the 
fact that they also shared a wife 
back on Earth who had borne each 
of them a child. Commander 
Norton hoped that he could meet 
her one day — she had to be a re- 
markable woman. The triangle 
had lasted for at least five years 
and still seemed to be an equilater- 
al one. 

Two men were not enough to 
make an exploring team. Three 
was the optimum — for if one man 
were lost two might still escape 
where a single survivor would be 
doomed. After a good deal of 



thought Norton chose Technical 
Sergeant Willard Myron. A me- 
chanical genius who could make 
anything work — or design some- 
thing better if it wouldn’t — My- 
ron was the ideal man to identify 
alien pieces of equipment. On a 
long sabbatical from his regular 
job as associate professor at As- 
trotech, the sergeant had refused 
to accept a commission on the 
grounds that he did not wish to 
block the promotion of more de- 
serving career officers. No one 
took this explanation very seri- 
ously and it was generally agreed 
that Will rated zero for ambition. 
He might make it to space ser- 
geant, but would never be a full 
professor. Myron, like countless 
NCOs before him, had discov- 
ered the ideal compromise be- 
tween power and responsibility. 

A S THEY drifted through the 
last airlock and floated out 
along the weightless axis of Rama, 
Joe Calvert found himself, as he 
so often did, in the middle of a 
movie 'flashback. He sometimes 
wondered if he should attempt to 
cure himself of this habit, but he 
could not see that it had any disad- 
vantages. It could make even the 
dullest situations interesting 
and — who could tell? One day it 
might save his life. He would re- 
member what Fairbanks or Con- 
nery or Hiroshi had done in simi- 
lar circumstances. 

This time he was about to go 
over the top in one of the early 
twentieth-century wars. Mercer 
was the sergeant, leading a three- 
man patrol on a night raid into No 
Man’s Land. It was not too diffi-

cult to imagine that they were at 
the bottom of an immense shell 
crater, though one that had some- 
how become neatly tailored into 
a series of ascending terraces. 
The crater was flooded with light 
from three widely spaced plasma 
arcs, which gave an almost 
shadowless illumination over the 
whole interior. But beyond 
that — over the rim of the most dis- 
tant terrace — lay darkness and 
mystery. 

In his mind’s eye Calvert knew 
perfectly well what lay there. 
First there was the circular plain 
over a kilometer across. Trisect- 
ing it into three equal parts — and 
looking very much like broad rail- 
road tracks — were three wide lad- 
ders, their rungs recessed into the 
surface so that they would pro- 
vide no obstruction to anything 
sliding over it. Since the arrange- 
ment was completely symmetri- 
cal there was no reason to chose 
one ladder rather than another. 
The one nearest to Airlock Al- 
pha had been selected purely as a 
matter of convenience. 

Though the rungs of the ladders 
were uncomfortably far apart 
they presented no problem. Even 
at the rim of the hub, half a kilom- 
eter from the axis, gravity was 
still barely one-thirtieth of the 
Earth’s. Although they were 
carrying almost a hundred kilos 
of equipment and life-support 
gear, they would still be able to 
move easily hand-over-hand. 

Commander Norton and the 
back-up team accompanied them 
along the guide ropes that had been 
stretched from Airlock Alpha to 
the rim of the crater. Beyond the 



range of the floodlights lay the 
darkness of Rama. All that could 
be seen in the dancing beams of 
the helmet lights was the first few 
hundred meters of the ladder, 
dwindling away across a flat and 
otherwise featureless plain. 

And now, Karl Mercer told him- 
self, / have to make my first deci- 
sion. Am I going up that ladder 
or down it? 

T he question was not a trivial 
one. They were still essentially 
in zero gravity and the brain could 
select any reference system it 
pleased. By a simple effort of will 
Mercer could convince himself 
that he was looking out across a 
horizontal plain or up the face of 
a vertical wall, or over the edge of 
a sheer cliff. Not a few astronauts 
had experienced grave psycho- 
locigal problems by choosing the 
wrong coordinates when they 
started on a complicated job. 

Mercer was determined to go 
head first, for any other mode of 
locomotion would be awk- 
ward — moreover he wanted to see 
what was in front of him. For the 
first few hundred meters, there- 
fore, he would imagine he was 
climbing — only when the increas- 
ing pull of gravity made it impos- 
sible to maintain the illusion 
would he switch his mental direc- 
tions one hundred and eighty de- 
grees. 

He grasped the first rung and 
gently propelled himself along 
the ladder. Movement was as ef- 
fortless as swimming along the 
seabed — more so, in fact, for there 
was no backward drag of water. It 
was so easy that there was a

temptation to go too fast, but 
Mercer was much too experi- 
enced to hurry in a situation as 
novel as this. 

In his earphones he could hear 
the regular breathing of his two 
companions. He needed no other 
proof that they were in good shape 
and wasted no time in conversa- 
tion. Though he was tempted to 
look back he decided not to risk it 
until they had reached the plat- 
form at the end of the ladder. 

The rungs were spaced a uni- 
form half-meter apart and for the 
first portion of the climb Mercer 
missed the alternate ones. But he 
counted them carefully and at 
around two hundred noticed the 
first distinct sensation of weight. 
The spin of Rama was starting to 
make itself felt. 

At rung four hundred he esti- 
mated that his apparent weight 
was about five kilos. This was no 
problem, but it was now getting 
hard to pretend that he was climb- 
ing when he was being firmly 
dragged upward. 

The five-hundredth rung seemed 
a good place to pause. He could 
feel the muscles in his arms re- 
sponding to the unaccustomed 
exercise, even though Rama was 
now doing all the work and he had 
merely to guide himself. 

“Everything okay, skipper,” he 
reported. “We’re just passing the 
halfway mark. Joe — Will, any 
problems?” 

“I’m fine. What are you stop- 
ping for?” Joe Calvert answered. 

“Same here,” added Sergeant 
Myron. “But watch out for the 
Coriolis force. It’s starting to 
build up.” 



So Mercer had already no- 
ticed. When he let go of the rungs 
he had a distinct tendency to drift 
off to the right. He knew perfect- 
ly well that this was merely the ef- 
fect of Rama’s spin, but it felt as if 
some mysterious force were gent- 
ly pushing him away from the 
ladder. 

Perhaps it was time to start go- 
ing feet first, now that “down” was 
beginning to have a physical 
meaning. He would run the risk of 
a momentary disorientation. 

“Watch out. I’m going to swing 
around.” 

H olding on firmly to the 
rung, he used his arms to twist 
himself around a hundred and 
eighty degrees and found himself 
momentarily blinded by the 
lights of his companions. Far 
above them he could see a fainter 
glow along the rim of the sheer 
cliff. Silhouetted against it were 
the figures of Commander Nor- 
ton and the backup team, watch- 
ing him intently. They seemed 
small and far away and he gave 
them a reassuring wave. 

He released his grip and let 
Rama’s still feeble pseudograv- 
ity take over. The drop from one 
rung to the next required more 
than two seconds — on Earth, in 
the same time, a man would have 
fallen thirty meters. 

The rate of fall was so painfully 
slow that he hurried things up a 
trifle by pushing with his hands, 
gliding over spans of a dozen 
rungs at a time and checking him- 
self with his feet whenever he felt 
he was traveling too fast. 

At rung seven hundred he came 



34 



GALAXY 




to another halt and swung the 
beam of his helmet lamp down- 
ward. The beginning of the stair- 
way was only fifty meters below. 

A few minutes later they stood 
on the top step. It was a strange ex- 
perience, after months in space, 
to stand upright on a solid sur- 
face, and to feel it pressing against 
one’s feet. Their weight was still 
less than ten kilograms, but that 
was enough to give a feeling of sta- 
bility. When he closed his eyes 
Mercer could believe that he once 
more had a real world beneath 
him. 

The ledge or platform from 
which the stairway descended 
was about ten meters wide and 
curved up on each side until it 
disappeared into the darkness. 
Mercer knew that it formed a 
complete circle and that if he 
walked along it for five kilome- 
ters he would come right back to 
his starting point. 

At the fractional gravity that 
existed here, however, real walk- 
ing was impossible — one could 
only bound along in giant strides. 
And therein lay danger. 

The stairway that swooped down 
into the darkness, far below the 
range of their lights, would be de- 
ceptively easy to descend. But it 
would be essential to hold on to 
the tall handrail that flanked it on 
either side — too bold a step might 
send an incautious traveler arch- 
ing far out into space. He would hit 
the surface again perhaps a hun- 
dred meters lower down. The im- 
pact would be harmless, but its 
consequences might not be— for 
the spin of Rama would have 
moved the stairway off to the left. 



And so a falling body would hit 
against the smooth curve that 
swept in an unbroken arc to the 
plain almost seven kilometers 
below. 

That, Mercer told himself, 
would be a hell of a toboggan 
ride. The terminal speed, even in 
this gravity, could be several hun- 
dred kilometers an hour. Per- 
haps it would be possible to ap- 
ply enough friction to check such a 
headlong descent — if so, this 
might even be the most conve- 
nient way to reach the inner sur- 
face of Rama. But some very cau- 
tious experimenting would be 
necessary first. 

Mercer reported: “There were 
no problems getting down the 
ladder. I’d like to continue 
toward the next platform. 1 want 
to time our rate of descent on the 
stairway.” 

Norton replied without hesita- 
tion. 

“Go ahead.” He did not need to 
add; “Proceed with caution.” 

I T DID not take Mercer long to 
make a fundamental discovery. 
It was impossible, at least at this 
gravity level, to walk down the 
stairway in the normal manner. 
Any attempt to do so resulted in 
a slow-motion, dreamlike move- 
ment that was intolerably 
tedious. The only practical way 
was to ignore the steps and to use 
the handrail to pull oneself down- 
ward. 

Calvert had come to the same 
conclusion. 

“This stairway was built to walk 
up, not down,” he said. “You can 
use the steps when you’re moving 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



35 




against gravity, but they’re just a 
nuisance in this direction. It may 
not be dignified, but I think the 
best way down is to slide along the 
handrail.” 

“That’s ridiculous,” protested 
Myron. “I can’t believe the 
Ramans did it this way.” 

“I doubt they ever used this 
stairway — it’s obviously only for 
emergencies. They must have had 
some mechanical transport sys- 
tem to get up here. A funicular, 
perhaps. That would explain 
those long slots running down 
from the hub.” 

“I’ve been assuming they were 
drains — but I suppose they could 
be both. I wonder if it ever rained 
here?” 

“Probably,” said Mercer. “But 
I think Joe is right — and to hell 
with dignity. Here we go.” 

The handrail — presumably it 
had been designed for something 
like hands — was a smooth flat 
metal bar supported on widely 
spaced pillars a meter high. Mer- 
cer straddled it, carefully gauged 
the braking power he could exert 
with his hands and let himself 
slide. 

Very sedately, slowly picking up 
speed, he descended into the 
darkness, moving in the pool of 
light from his helmet lamp. He 
had gone about fifty meters when 
he called the others to join him. In 
less than two minutes, they had 
made a kilometer descent in 
safety and comfort. 

“I hope you enjoyed your- 
selves,” Commander Norton 
called when they stepped off at the 
second platform. “Climbing 
back won’t be quite so easy.” 



“That’s what I want to check,” 
replied Mercer, who was walking 
experimentally back and forth, 
getting the feel of the increased 
gravity. “It’s already a tenth of a 
gee here — you really notice the 
difference.” 

He walked to the edge of the 
platform and shone his helmet 
light down the next section of the 
stairway. As far as his beam could 
reach the steps appeared identical 
with the ones above — though care- 
ful examination of photos had in- 
dicated that their height steadily 
decreased with the rising gravity. 
The stair had apparently been de- 
signed so that the effort required 
to climb it was more or less con- 
stant at every point in its long 
curving sweep. 

Mercer glanced up toward the 
hub of Rama, now almost two 
kilometers above him. The little 
glow of light and the tiny figures 
silhouetted against it seemed hor- 
ribly far away. For the first time 
he was glad that he could not see 
the whole length of this enormous 
stairway. Despite his steady nerves 
and lack of imagination he was 
not sure how he would react if he 
could see himself like an insect 
crawling up the face of a vertical 
saucer sixteen kilometers high — 
and with the upper half hanging 
above him. Until this moment, he 
had regarded the darkness as a 
nuisance — now he welcomed it. 

“There’s no change of tempera- 
ture,” he reported to Norton. 
“Still just below freezing. But the 
air pressure is up as we ex- 
pected — around three hundred 
millbars. Even with this low oxy- 
gen content it’s almost breath- 



36 



GALAXY 




able — farther down there will be 
no problem at all. That will 
simplify exploration enormous- 
ly. What a find — the first World on 
which we can walk without breath- 
ing gear. I'm going to take a 
sniff." 



U P ON the Hub Commander 
Norton stirred a little uneas- 
ily. But Mercer, of all men, knew 
what he was doing. He would al- 
ready have made enough tests to 
satisfy himself. 

Mercer equalized pressure, un- 
latched the securing clip of his hel- 
met and opened it a crack. He took 
a cautious breath, then a deeper 
one. 

The air of Rama was dead and 
musty, as if from a tomb so an- 
cient that the last trace of physical 
corruption had disappeared ages 
ago. Even Mercer’s ultra-sensi- 
tive nose, trained through years of 
testing life-support systems to 
and beyond the point of disaster, 
could detect no recognizable 
odors. There was a faint metallic 
tang and he suddenly recalled 
that the first men on the moon had 
reported a hint of burned gun- 
powder when they repressurized 
the lunar module. Mercer imag- 
ined that the moondusty cabin on 
Eagle must have tasted rather like 
Rama. 

He sealed the helmet again and 
emptied his lungs of the alien air. 
He had extracted no sustenance 
from it — even a mountaineer ac- 
climatized to the summit of Ever- 
est would die quickly here. But a 
few kilometers farther down it 
would be a different matter. 



What else was there to do here? 
He could think of nothing except 
the enjoyment of the gentle, un- 
accustomed gravity. But there 
was no point in growing used to 
that, since they would be return- 
ing immediately to the weight- 
lessness of the hub. 

“We’re coming back," he re- 
ported. “There’s no reason to go 
on until we're ready to go all the 
way.” 

“I agree. We’ll be timing you, 
but take it easy.” 

As he bounded up the steps, 
three or four at a stride, Mercer 
agreed that Calvert had been per- 
fectly correct — these stairs were 
built to be walked up, not down. As 
long as one did not look back and 
ignored the vertiginous steepness 
of the ascending curve the climb 
was a delightful experience. After 
about two hundred steps, however, 
he began to feel some twinges in 
his calf muscles and decided to 
slow down. The others had done 
the same. When he ventured a 
quick glance over his shoulder he 
saw them considerably farther 
down the slope. 

The climb was wholly unevent- 
ful — merely an apparently end- 
less succession of steps. When 
they stood once more on the high- 
est platform, immediately be- 
neath the ladder, they were barely 
winded and to reach this point had 
taken them only ten minutes. They 
paused for another ten, then start- 
ed on the last vertical kilometer. 

Jump — catch hold of a rung — 
jump — catch — ^jump — catch ... it 
was easy, but so boringly repeti- 
tious that carelessness became a 
danger. Halfway up the ladder 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



37 




they rested for five minutes. Once 
again Mercer was glad that he 
could see so little of the vertical 
face to which he was clinging. It 
was not too difficult to pretend 
that the ladder extended only a 
few meters beyond the circle of 
light and would soon come to an 
end. 

Jump — catch a rung — jump — 
then, quite suddenly, the ladder 
did end. They were back at. the 
weightless world of the axis. The 
whole trip had taken under an 
hour and they felt a sense of 
modest achievement. Yet each of’ 
them knew that, for all their ef- 
forts, they had traversed less than 
an eighth of that cyclopean stair- 
way. 

VII 

S OME women. Commander 
Norton had decided long ago, 
should not be allowed aboard 
ship — weightlessness did things to 
their breasts that were too damn 
distracting. It was bad enough 
when they were motionless, but 
when they started to move and 
sympathetic vibrations set in, it 
was more than any warm-blooded 
male should be asked to take. He 
was quite sure that at least one se- 
rious space accident had been 
caused by acute crew distraction, 
after the transit of an unhol- 
stered lady officer through the 
control cabin. 

He had once mentioned this 
theory to Endeavor's Dr. Laura 
Ernst, without revealing who had 
inspired his particular train of 
thought. There was no need — they 
knew each other much too well. On 



Earth, years ago, in a moment of 
mutual loneliness and depres- 
sion they had once made love. 
Probably they would never repeat 
the experience (but could one ever 
be quite sure of that?) because so 
much had changed for both of 
them. Yet whenever the well-built 
surgeon oscillated into the com- 
manders' cabin he felt a fleeting 
echo of an old passion — she knew 
that he felt it and everyone was 
happy. 

“Bill,” she began, “I’ve checked 
our mountaineers and here's my 
verdict. Karl and Joe are in good 
shape — all indications normal 
for the work they've done. But Will 
shows signs of exhaustion and 
fluid loss — I won’t bother with 
the details. I don't believe he’s 
been getting all the exercise he 
should — and he’s not the only one. 
There’s been some cheating in the 
centrifuge. If there’s any more, 
heads will roll. Please pass the 
word.” 

“Yes, ma’am. But there’s some 
excuse. The men have been work- 
ing very hard.” 

“With their brains and fingers, 
certainly. But not with their bod- 
ies — not real work in kilogram- 
meters. And thaEs what we'll be 
dealing with if we’re ^oing to ex- 
plore Rama." 

“Well, can we?” 

“Yes, if we proceed with cau- 
tion. Karl and 1 have worked out a 
very conservative profile — based 
on the assumption that we can 
dispense with breathing gear be- 
low Level Two. Of course, that's 
an incredible stroke of luck and 
changes the whole logistics pic- 
ture. I still can’t get used to the 



38 



GALAXY 




idea of a world with oxygen. But 
we only need to supply food and 
water and thermosuits and we’re 
in business. Going down will be 
easy — it looks as if we can slide 
most of the way on that very con- 
venient bannister.” 

“I've got Chips working on a 
sled with parachute braking. 
Even if we can't risk it for crew we 
can use it for stores and equip- 
ment.” 

“Fine. That should do the trip in 
ten minutes — otherwise it will 
take about an hour. Climbing up 
is harder to estimate. I’d like to al- 
low six hours, including two one- 
hour rest periods. Later, as we get 
experience — and develop some 
muscles — we may be able to cut 
this back considerably.” 

“What about psychological fac- 
tors?” 

“Hard to assess in such a novel 
environment. Darkness may be 
the biggest problem.” 

“I'll establish searchlights on 
the hub. Besides its own lamps, 
any party down there will always 
have a beam playing on it.” 

“Good. That should be a great 
help.” 

“One other point — should we 
play safe and send a party only 
halfway down the stair and 
back — or should we go the whole 
way on the first attempt?” 

“If we had plenty of time I'd be 
cautious. But time is short and I 
can see no danger in going all the 
way — and looking around when 
we get there.” 

“Thanks, Laura. That's all 1 
want to know. I'll get the exec 
working on the details. And I'll 
order all hands to the centri- 



fuge — twenty minutes a day at 
half a gee. Will that satisfy you?” 
“No. It's point six gee down 
there in Rama and I want a safety 
margin. Make it, oh, three-quar- 
ters — ” 

“Ouch!” 

“ — for ten minutes — ” 

“I’ll settle for that — ” 

“ — twice a day.” 

“Laura, you’re a cruel, hard 
woman. But so be it. I’ll break the 
news just before dinner. That 
should spoil a few appetites.” 

I T WAS the first time that Com- 
mander Norton had ever seen 
Karl Mercer slightly ill at ease. 
He had spent fifteen minutes dis- 
cussing logistics problems in his 
usual competent manner, but 
something was obviously worry- 
ing him. His captain, who had a 
shrewd idea of what it was, waited 
patiently until he brought it out. 

Karl said at length, “Are you 
sure you should lead this party? If 
anything goes wrong I’m con- 
siderably more expendable. And 
I’ve been farther inside Rama 
than anyone else — even if only by 
fifty meters.” 

“Granted. But it’s time the com- 
mander led his troops and we’ve 
decided that there's no greater risk 
on this trip than on the last. At the 
first sign of trouble I'll be back up 
that stairway fast enough to qual- 
ify for the Lunar Olympics.” 

He waited for further objec- 
tions, but none came, though Karl 
still looked unhappy. 

Norton added gently: “And I bet 
Joe will beat me to the top.” 

Mercer relaxed and a slow grin 
spread across his face. “All the 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAAAA 



39 




same, Bill, I wish you’d chosen 
someone else.” 

“I wanted one man who had 
been down before and we can’t 
both go. As for Sergeant Myron, 
Laura says he’s still two kilos over- 
weight. Even shaving off that mus- 
tache didn’t help.” 

“Who’s your number three?” 

“I still haven’t decided. That de- 
pends on Laura.” 

“She wants to go?” 

“Who doesn’t? But if she turns 
up at the top of her own fitness list 
I’ll be very suspicious.” 

As Mercer gathered up his pa- 
pers and launched himself out of 
the cabin Norton felt a brief stab 
of envy. Almost all the crew had 
worked out some sort of emotion- 
al accommodation. He had 
known ships where the captain 
had done the same, but that was 
not his way. Though discipline 
aboard Endeavor was based large- 
ly on mutual respect between 
highly trained and intelligent 
men and women, the commander 
needed something more to under- 
line his position. His responsibil- 
ity was unique and demanded a 
degree of isolation even from his 
closest friends to avoid charges of 
favortism. For this reason affairs 
spanning more than two degrees 
of rank were firmly discouraged. 
But apart from that, the only rule 
regulating sex was: “So long as 
they don’t do it in the corridors 
and frighten the simps.” 

There were four superchimps 
aboard Endeavor, though strictly 
speaking the name was inac- 
curate, because the ship’s non- 
human crew was not based on 
chimpanzee stock. In zero grav- 



ity a prehensile tail is an enor- 
mous advantage and all attempts 
to supply these to humans had 
turned into embarrassing fail- 
ures. After equally unsatisfac- 
tory results with the great apes the 
Superchimpanzee Corporation 
had turned to the monkey king- 
dom. 

Blackie, Blondie, Goldie and 
Brownie had family trees whose 
branches included the most in- 
telligent of the Old and New 
World monkeys, plus synthetic 
genes that had never existed in na- 
ture. Their rearing and education 
had likely cost as much as those 
of the average spaceman and they 
were worth it. Each weighed less 
than thirty kilos and consumed 
only half the food and oxygen of a 
human being, but each could re- 
place 2.75 men for housekeeping, 
elementary cooking, tool-carry- 
ing and dozens of other routine 
jobs. 

That 2.75 was the corpora- 
tion’s claim, based on innumera- 
ble time-and-motion studies. The 
figure, though surprising and fre- 
quently challenged, appeared to 
be accurate, for simps were quite 
happy to work fifteen hours a day 
and did not get bored by the most 
menial and repetitious tasks. So 
they freed human beings for hu- 
man work. And on a spaceship 
that was a matter of vital impor- 
tance. 

U NLIKE the monkeys who were 
their nearest relatives. En- 
deavor's simps were docile, obe- 
dient and uninquisitive. Being 
cloned, they were also sexless, 
which eliminated awkward be-

havioral problems. Carefully 
house-trained vegetarians, they 
were clean and didn’t smell — they 
would have made perfect pets, ex- 
cept that nobody could possibly 
have afforded them. 

Still, having simps on board in- 
volved certain problems. They 
had to have their own quar- 
ters — inevitably labeled “The 
Monkey House.” Their little 
mess room was always spotless 
and was equipped with TV, games, 
equipment and programed teach- 
ing machines. To avoid accidents 
they were absolutely forbidden 
to enter the ship’s technical 
areas — the entrances to all these 
were color-coded in red and the 
simps were conditioned so that it 
was psychologically impossible 
for them to pass these visual bar- 
riers. 

There was also a communica- 
tions problem. Though they had 
an I.Q. equivalent of 60 and could 
understand several hundred 
words of English, they were un- 
able to talk. It had proved impos- 
sible to give useful vocal chords 
either to apes or monkeys and 
they therefore had to express 
themselves in sign language. 

The basic signs were obvious 
and easily learned, so that every- 
one on board ship could under- 
stand routine messages. But the 
only man who could speak fluent 
Simplish was their handler. Chief 
Steward Me Andrews. 

It was a standing joke that Ser- 
geant Ravi McAndrews also 
looked rather like a simp —which 
was hardly an insult, for with 
their short, tinted pelts and grace- 
ful movements the simps were 



handsome animals. They were 
also affectionate and everyone 
on board had his favorite — Com- 
mander Norton’s was the aptly 
named Goldie. 

But the warm relationship one 
could so easily establish with 
simps created another problem, 
often used as a powerful argu- 
ment against their employment in 
space. Since they could only be 
trained for routine, low-grade 
tasks they were worse than useless 
in an emergency — they could then 
be a danger to themselves and to 
their human companions. In par- 
ticular, teaching them to use 
spacesuits had proved impos- 
sible, the concepts involved being 
quite beyond their understand- 
ing. 

No one liked to talk about it, but 
everybody knew what had to be 
done if a hull were breached or the 
order came to abandon ship. It 
had happened only once — then the 
simp handler had carried out his 
instructions more than adequate- 
ly. He was found with his charges, 
killed by the same poison. There- 
after, the job of euthing was 
transferred to the chief medical 
officer who, it was felt, would have 
less emotional involvement. 

Norton was thankful that this re- 
sponsibility, at least, did not fall 
upon the captain’s shoulders. He 
had known men he would have 
killed with far fewer qualms than 
he would have felt about destroy- 
ing Goldie.

I N THE clear, cold atmosphere 
of Rama the beam of the search- 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA

light was completely invisible. 
Three kilometers down from the 
central hub, the hundred-meter 
oval of light lay across a section of 
that colossal stairway. A bril- 
liant oasis in the surrounding 
darkness, it was sweeping slowly 
toward the curved plain still five 
kilometers below and in its cen- 
ter moved a trio of antlike fig- 
ures. 

It had been, just as they had 
hoped and expected, a complete- 
ly uneventful descent. They had 
paused briefly at the first plat- 
form and Norton had walked a 
few hundred meters along the 
narrow, curving ledge before 
starting the slide down to the sec- 
ond level. Here they had discard- 
ed their oxygen gear and reveled 
in the strange luxury of being able 
to breathe without mechanical 
aids. Now they could explore in 
comfort, freed from the greatest 
danger that confronts a man in 
space. 

By the time they had reached the 
fifth level — and there was only one 
more section to go — gravity had 
reached almost half its terrestrial 
value. Rama's centrifugal spin 
was at last exerting its real 
strength — they were surrendering 
themselves to the implacable 
force that rules every planet and 
can exert a merciless price for 
the smallest slip. It was still easy 
to go downward; but the thought 
of the return up those thousands 
upon thousands of steps was al- 
ready beginning to prey on their 
minds.' 

The stairway had long ago 
ceased its vertiginous downward 
plunge and was now flattening 



out toward the horizontal. The 
gradient was now only about one 
in five — at the beginning, it had 
been five in one. Normal walking 
was now both physically and psy- 
chologically acceptable — only 
the gravity reminded them that 
they were not descending some 
great stairway on Earth. Norton 
had once visited the ruins of an 
Aztec temple and the feelings he 
had then experienced now came 
echoing back to him — amplified 
a hundred times. Here was the 
same sense of awe and mystery 
and the sadness of the irrevoca- 
bly vanished past. Yet the scale 
here was so much greater both in 
time and space that the mind was 
unable to do it justice — after a 
while the senses ceased to respond. 
Norton wondered if, sooner or 
later, he would take even Rama for 
granted. 

In another respect the parallel 
with terrestrial ruins failed com- 
pletely. Rama was hundreds of 
times older than any structure that 
had survived on Earth — even the 
Great Pyramid. But everything 
here looked absolutely new — 
there was no sign of wear and tear. 

Norton had puzzled over this a 
good deal and had arrived at a 
tentative explanation. Every- 
thing that they had so far examined 
secured part of an emergency 
backup system, seldom put to 
actual use. He could not imagine 
that the Ramans — unless they 
were physical fitness fanat- 
ics — ever walked up and down this 
incredible stairway or its two 
identical companions. Perhaps 
the stairs had only been required 
during the actual construction 



42 



GALAXY 




of Rama and had served no pur- 
pose since that distant day. That 
theory would do for the moment, 
yet it did not feel right. Something 
was wrong somewhere. 

They did not slide for the last ki- 
lometer but went down the steps 
two at a time in long, gentle 
strides — this way, Norton de- 
cided, they would give more exer- 
cise to muscles that would soon 
have to be used. And so the end of 
the stairway came upon them un- 
announced — suddenly there were 
no more steps. A flat plain, dull 
gray in the now weakening beam 
of the hub searchlight, faded into 
darkness a few hundred meters 
ahead. 

Norton looked back along the 
beam. He knew that Mercer 
would be watching through the 
telescope. He waved. 

“Captain speaking,” he re- 
ported over the radio. “Everyone 
in fine shape — no problems. Pro- 
ceeding as planned.” 

“Good,” replied Mercer. “We’ll 
be watching.” 

T here was a brief silence. 

Then a new voice cut in. “This 
is the exec on board ship. Really, 
skipper, that isn't good enough. 
You know the news services have 
been screaming at us for the last 
week. 1 don’t expect deathless 
prose, but can’t you do better?” 

“I’ll try.” Norton chuckled. 
“There’s nothing to see as yet. It’s 
like — well, being on a huge, dark- 
ened stage under a single spot- 
light. The first few hundred steps 
of the stairway rise out of it until 
they disappear into the darkness 
overhead. What we can see of the 



plain looks perfectly flat — the 
curvature’s too small to be vis- 
ible over this limited area. That’s 
about it.” 

“Care to give any impressions?” 

“Well, it’s cold here — below 
freezing — and we’re glad of our 
thermosuits. And it’s quiet — 
quieter than anything I’ve ever 
known on Earth or in space, 
where there’s always some back- 
ground noise. Here every sound is 
swallowed up — the area around us 
is so enormous that there aren’t 
any echoes. It’s weird. I hope we 
can get used to it.” 

“Thanks, skipper. Anyone 
else — Joe, Boris?”. 

Joe Calvert, never at a loss for 
words, was happy to oblige. 

“I can’t help thinking that this 
is the first time — ever — that we’ve 
been able to walk on another 
world, breathing its natural at- 
mosphere — though I suppose 
‘natural’ is hardly the word you 
should apply to a place like this. 
Still, Rama must resemble the 
world of its builders — our own 
spaceships are all miniature 
Earths. Two examples are 
damned poor statistics, but does 
this mean that all intelligent life 
forms are oxygen-eaters? What 
we’ve seen of their work suggests 
that the Ramans were humanoid, 
though perhaps about fifty per 
cent taller than we are. Wouldn’t 
you agree, Boris?” 

To all his shipmates Lieutenant 
Boris Rodrigo was something of 
an enigma. The quiet, dignified 
communications officer was 
popular with the rest of the crew, 
but he never entered fully into 
its activities and always seemed 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



43 




a little apart — marching to the 
music of a different drummer. 

As indeed he was, being a de- 
vout member of the Fifth Church 
of Christ, Cosmonaut. Norton 
had never been able to discover 
what had happened to the earlier 
four and he was equally in the 
dark about the Church’s rituals 
and ceremonies. But the main 
tenet of its faith was widely 
known — it had constructed an en- 
tire theology on the assumption 
that Jesus Christ was a visitor 
from space. 

It was perhaps not surprising 
that an unusually high propor- 
tion of the devotees worked in 
space in some capacity or other. 
Invariably they were efficient, 
conscientious and absolutely 
reliable. They were universally 
respected and even liked, es- 
pecially as they made no attempt 
to convert others. But there was 
also something slightly spooky 
about them — Norton could never 
understand how men with ad- 
vanced scientific and technical 
training could possibly believe 
some of the things he had heard 
Christers state as incontroverti- 
ble facts. 

As he waited for Rodrigo to an- 
swer Norton wondered if some 
part of his mind had not selected 
the lieutenant for this mission out 
of curiosity — to see how a man 
with Rodrigo’s religious beliefs 
would react to the awesome real- 
ity of Rama. 

Boris Rodrigo finally answered 
Joe’s possibly loaded question 
with his usual caution: “They were 
certainly oxygen-breathers and 
they could be humanoid. But let’s 



wait and see. With any luck we 
should discover what they were 
like. There may be pictures, stat- 
ues — perhaps even bodies in those 
towns. If they are towns.’’ 

“The nearest is only eight ki- 
lometers away,’’ Joe Calver said 
hopefully. 

A quick sortie to the “town” 
they had named Paris had been 
among the first of Norton’s con- 
tingency plans. Could he now risk 
it? They had ample food and wa- 
ter for a stay of twenty-four hours. 
They would always be in full view 
of the backup team on the Hub 
and any kind of accident seemed 
virtually impossible on this 
smooth, gently curving metal 
plain. The only foreseeable dan- 
ger was exhaustion, and time was 
a consideration. Even a brief for- 
ay could be worth much — there 
was so little time as Rama hurtled 
sunward, toward a perihelion too 
dangerous for Endeavor to match. 

In any case, part of the deci- 
sion was not his to make. Up in the 
ship. Dr. Ernst would be watching 
the outputs of the bio-telemeter- 
ing sensors attached to his body. 
If she turned thumbs down, that 
would be that. 

“Laura, what do you think?’’ 

“Take thirty minutes’ rest and a 
five-hundred-calorie energy mod- 
ule. Then you can start.’’ 

“Thanks, doc.’’ From Joe Cal- 
vert. “Now I can die happy. I al- 
ways wanted to see Paris. Mont- 
martre, here we come.’’ 



A fter those interminable 
stairs it was a strange luxury 
to walk once more on a horizon- 



44 



GALAXY 




tal surface. Directly ahead the 
ground was indeed completely 
Hat. To right and left, at the limits 
of the floodlit area, the rising 
curve could barely be detected. 
They might have been walking the 
bottom of a wide, shallow val- 
ley — it was quite impossible to 
believe that they were really 
crawling along the inside of a 
huge cylinder and that beyond 
this little oasis of light the land 
rose up to meet — no, to be- 
come — the sky. 

Though all three felt a sense of 
confidence and subdued excite- 
ment the almost palpable silence 
of Rama began shortly to weigh 
heavily upon them. Every foot- 
step, every word vanished instant- 
ly into the unreverberant void — af- 
ter they had gone little more than 
half a kilometer Calvert could 
stand it no longer. 

Among his minor accomplish- 
ments was a talent for whistling. 
With or without encouragement 
he could reproduce the themes 
from most of the movies of the last 
two hundred years. He started at 
the beginning of his repertory 
and progressed, more or less 
chronologically, through half a 
dozen epics — culminating with 
the theme from Sid Krassman’s 
famous late twentieth century 
Napoleon — before he realized the 
inappropriateness of his ef- 
forts. Rama made trivia of his 
tunes — they were lost in the un- 
echoing stillness. Thereafter, 
apart from an occasional con- 
sultation with the ship, the trio 
marched in silence. Rama had won 
this round. 

On his initial traverse Norton 



had allowed for one detour. Paris 
lay straight ahead, halfway be- 
tween the foot of the stairway and 
the shore of the Cylindrical Sea, 
but only a kilometer to the right 
of their track lay a prominent and 
rather mysterious feature which 
had been christened the Straight 
Valley. It was a long groove or 
trench, forty meters deep and a 
hundred wide, with gently slop- 
ing sides — it had been provis- 
ionally identified as an irriga- 
tion ditch or canal. Like the stair- 
way, it had two counterparts, 
equally spaced around the curve of 
Rama. 

The three valleys were almost 
ten kilometers long and stopped 
abruptly just before they reached 
the sea — which was strange if they 
were intended to carry water. 
And on the other side of the sea the 
pattern was repeated; three more 
ten-kilometer trenches contin- 
ued to the South Polar region. 

The men reached the rim of the 
Straight Valley. The perfectly 
smooth walls sloped down at an an- 
gle of sixty degrees — there were 
no steps or footholds. Filling the 
bottom was a sheet of flat, white 
material that looked very much 
like ice. A specimen could settle a 
good many arguments and Nor- 
ton decided to get one. 

With Calvert and Rodrigo act- 
ing as anchors and playing out a 
safety rope, he rapelled slowly 
down the steep incline. When he 
reached the bottom he fully ex- 
pected to find the familiar slip- 
pery feel of ice underfoot, but he 
was mistaken. His footing re- 
mained secure. The material was 
some kind of glass or transparent 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



45 




crystal — when he touched it with 
his fingertips it was cold, hard 
and unyielding. 

Turning his back to the search- 
light and shielding his eyes from 
its glare, Norton tried to peer into 
the crystalline depths. He could 
see nothing. The stuff was trans- 
lucent but not transparent. 

He tapped it gently with the 
hammer from his geology 
kit — the tool rebounded with a 
dull, unmusical clunk. He tapped 
harder with no more result and 
was about to exert his full strength 
when some impulse made him 
desist. 

It seemed most unlikely that he 
could crack this material — but 
what if he did? He would simply be 
a vandal, smashing something he 
did not understand. He had al- 
ready discovered valuable in- 
formation. It now seemed more 
unlikely than ever that this was a 
canal— it was simply a peculiar 
trench that stopped and started 
abruptly but led nowhere. If at 
any time it had carried li- 
quid — where were the stains, the 
encrustations of dried-up sedi- 
ment? Everything was bright and 
clean, as if the builders had left 
only yesterday. 

Once again, he was face to face 
with the fundamental mystery of 
Rama and now for the first time he 
had a sense not exactly of fore- 
boding but of anticipation. 
Things were not what they seemed. 
There was something odd about a 
place that was simultaneously 
new and a million years old. 

He began to walk slowly and 
thoughtfully along the length of 
the little valley His companions. 



still holding the rope that was at- 
tached to his waist, followed along 
the rim. He did not expect to 
make any further discoveries, 
but he wanted to let his curious 
emotional state run its course. 
For something else was worrying 
him and it had nothing to do with 
the inexplicable newness of Rama. 

He had walked no more than a 
dozen meters when it hit him like 
a thunderbolt. 

He knew this place. He had been 
here before. 

T O RECOGNIZE a spot no hu- 
man being could possibly have 
seen was shocking. For several 
seconds Commander Norton 
stood glued to the smooth crystal- 
line surface, trying to straighten 
out his emotions. His well-or- 
dered universe had been turned 
upside down and he had a dizzy- 
ing glimpse of those mysteries at 
the edge of existence which he had 
successfully ignored for most of 
his life. 

Then, to his immense relief, 
common sense came to his rescue. 
The disturbing sensation of deja 
vu faded, to be replaced by a real 
and identifiable memory from 
his youth. 

It was true that he had once 
stood between such steeply slop- 
ing walls and watched them drive 
into the distance until they 
seemed to converge at a point in- 
definitely far ahead. But they had 
been covered with neatly trimmed 
grass and underfoot had been 
broken stone, not smooth crystal. 

It had happened thirty years 
ago, during a summer vacation 
in England. Largely because of 



46 



GALAXY 




another student (he could re- 
member her face, but had forgot- 
ten her name) he had taken a 
course in industrial archeology, 
then very popular among science 
and engineering graduates. She 
and he had explored abandoned 
coal mines and cotton mills, 
climbed over ruined blast furnaces 
and steam engines, goggled unbe- 
lievingly at primitive (and still 
dangerous) nuclear reactors and 
had driven priceless turbine-pow- 
ered antiques along restored 
motor roads. 

Not everything they had seen 
had been genuine. Much had been 
lost during the centuries, for men 
seldom bother to preserve the 
commonplace articles of every- 
day life. But copies had been recon- 
structed with loving care. And 
young Norton had found himself 
bowling along at an exhilarating 
hundred kilometers an hour 
while furiously shoveling prec- 
ious coal into the firebox of a loco- 
motive that had looked two hun- 
dred years old, but was actually 
younger than he was. The thirty- 
kilometer stretch of the Great 
Western Railway, however, had 
been quite genuine, though it had 
required a good deal of excavat- 
ing to get it back into commision. 

Whistle screaming, the train 
had plunged into a hillside and 
raced through a smoky, flame-lit 
darkness. An astonishingly long 
time later it had burst out of the 
tunnel into a deep, perfectly 
straight cut between steep grassy 
banks. The long-forgotten vista 
was almost identical with the one 
before him now. 

“What is it. Skipper?” called 



Rodrigo. “Have you found some- 
thing?” 

As Norton dragged himself 
back to present reality some of 
the oppression lifted from his 
mind. There was mystery here — 
yes, but it might not be beyond 
human understanding. He had 
learned a lesson, though it was 
not one that he could readily im- 
part to others. At all costs he must 
not let Rama overwhelm him. 
That way lay failure — perhaps 
even madness. 

“No,” he answered, “there’s 
nothing down here. Haul me 
up — we’ll head straight to Paris.” 

IX 

UT ’VE called this meeting of 

J. the committee,” Dr. Bose 
said, “because Dr. Perera has 
something important to tell us. 
He insists that we get in touch 
with Commander Norton right 
away, using the priority channel 
we’ve been able to establish af- 
ter, I might say, a good deal of dif- 
ficulty. Dr. Perera’s statement is 
rather technical and before we 
come to it 1 think a summary of 
the present position might be in 
order. Dr. Price has prepared 
one. Oh, yes — some apologies for 
absence. Sir Robert is en route to 
Earth, Professor Solorhons is 
somewhere at the bottom of the 
Pacific and Dr. Taylor asks to be 
excused.” 

He was rather pleased about 
that last absence The anthro- 
pologist had rapidly lost interest in 
Rama when it became obvious 
that it would present little scope 
for him. Like many others he had 



RENDEZVOUSWITH RAMA 



47 




been bitterly disappointed to 
find that the mobile worldlet was 
dead — there would be no oppor- 
tunity for sensational books and 
viddies about Raman rituals and 
behavioral patterns. Others 
might dig up skeletons and classi- 
fy artifacts — that sort of thing did 
not appeal to Conrad Taylor. 
Perhaps the only discovery that 
would bring him back in a hurry 
would be some highly explicit 
works of art — like the notorious 
frescoes of Thera and Pompei. 

Thelma Price, the archeologist, 
took exactly the opposite point 
of view. She preferred excava- 
tions and ruins uncluttered by in- 
habitants who might interfere 
with dispassionate, scientific 
studies. The bed of the Mediter- 
ranean had been ideal — at least 
until the city planners and land- 
scape artists had started getting 
in the way. And Rama would have 
been perfect, except for the mad- 
dening detail that it was a hun- 
dred million kilometers away and 
she would never be able to visit it 
in person. 

“As you all know,” she began, 
“Commander Norton has com- 
pleted one traverse of almost 
thirty kilometers without en- 
countering any problems. He ex- 
plored the curious trench shown 
on your maps as the Straight Val- 
ley. Its purpose is still unknown, 
but it’s clearly important. It runs 
the full length of Rama — except 
for the break at the Cylindrical 
Sea — and there are two other 
identical structures a hundred 
and twenty degrees apart around 
the circumference. 

“Then the party turned left — or 



east, if we adopt the North Pole 
convention — until it reached Pa- 
ris. As you’ll see from this photo- 
graph, taken by a telescopic 
camera at the Hub, Paris is a 
group of several hundred build- 
ings separated by wide streets. 

“Now these photographs were 
taken by Commander Norton’s 
group when they reached the site. 
If Paris is a city it’s a very pe- 
culiar one. Note that none of the 
buildings have windows or even 
doors. They are all plain, rectan- 
gular structures an identical 
thirty-five meters high. And they 
appear to have been extruded out 
of the ground — there are no seams 
or joints. Look at this closeup of 
the base of a wall — there’s a 
smooth transition into the 
ground. 

“My own feeling is that this 
place is not a residential area, but 
a storage or supply depot. In 
support of that theory, look at this 
photo . 

“These narrow slots or grooves, 
about five centimeters wide, run 
along all the streets and there’s one 
leading to every building, going 
straight into the wall. There’s a 
striking resemblance to the 
streetcar tracks of the early twen- 
tieth century — they are obvious- 
ly part of some transport system. 

“We’ve never considered it 
necessary to have public trans- 
port connect directly with every 
house. It would be economically 
absurd — people can always walk 
a few hundred meters. But if these 
buildings were used for the stor- 
age of heavy materials, direct ac- 
cess by transportation machin- 
ery would make sense.” 



48 



GALAXY 




“May I ask a question?” From 
the representative for Earth. 

“Of course.” 

“Commander Norton couldn’t 
get into a single building?” 

“No. When you listen to his re- 
port, you can tell he was quite frus- 
trated. At one time he decided 
that the buildings could only be 
entered from underground. Then 
he discovered the grooves of the 
transport system and changed his 
mind.” 

“Did he try to break in?” 

“There was no way he 
could — without explosives or 
heavy tools. And he doesn’t want 
to smash anything until all other 
approaches have failed.” 

“I have it!” the representative 
suddenly interjected. “Co- 
cooning.” 

“I beg your pafdon?” 

“It’s a technique developed a 
couple of hundred years ago. An- 
other name for it is mothballing. 
When you have something you 
want to preserve you seal it inside 
a plastic envelope and then pump 
in an inert gas. The original use 
was to protect military equip- 
ment between wars — it was once 
applied to whole ships. It’s still 
widely used in museums that are 
short of storage space. No one 
knows what’s inside some of the 
hundred-year-old cocoons in the 
Smithsonian basement.” 

Patience was not one of Car- 
lisle Perera’s virtues — he was ach- 
ing to drop his bombshell and 
could restrain himself no longer. 

“PI ease, Mr: Ambassador! 
This is all very interesting, but I 
feel my information is rather 
more urgent.” 



“If there are no other 
points — very well. Dr. Perera.” 

T he exobiologist, unlike Con- 
rad Taylor, had not found 
Rama a disappointment. It was 
true that he no longer expected 
to find life — but sooner or later, 
he had been quite sure, some re- 
mains would be discovered of the 
creatures who had built this fan- 
tastic world. The exploration 
had barely begun, although the 
time available was horribly brief 
before Endeavor would be forced 
to escape from her present sun- 
grazing orbit. 

But now, if his calculations 
were correct, man’s contact with 
Rama would be even shorter than 
he had feared. For one detail had 
been overlooked because it was so 
large that no one had noticed it be- 
fore. 

“According to our latest in- 
formation,” Perera began, “one 
party of explorers is now on its 
way to the Cylindrical Sea, while 
Commander Norton has anoth- 
er group setting up a supply base 
at the foot of Stairway Alpha. 
When that’s established he in- 
tends to have at least two explora- 
tory missions operating at all 
times. In this way he hopes to use 
his limited manpower at maxi- 
mum efficiency. 

“It’s a good plan, but there may 
be no time to carry it out. In fact, 
1 would advise an immediate 
alert and a preparation for total 
withdrawal on twelve hours’ no- 
tice. Let me explain. 

“It’s surprising how few peo- 
ple have commented on a rather 
obvious anomaly about Rama. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA

The artifact is now well inside the 
orbit of Venus — yet the interior 
is still frozen. But the temper- 
ature of an object in direct sun- 
light at this point is about five hun- 
dred degrees. 

“The reason for the cold inte- 
rior is, of course, that Rama 
hasn’t had time to warm up. It 
must have cooled down to near ab- 
solute zero— two hundred sev- 
enty below — while it was in' inter- 
stellar space. Now its outer hull is 
already almost as hot as molten 
lead. There’s some kind of fancy 
dessert with a hot exterior and 
ice cream in the middle — I don’t 
remember what it’s called — ’’ 

“Baked Alaska. It’s a favorite 
at U.P. ' banquets, unfortunate- 
ly” 

“Thank you. That’s the situ- 
ation in Rama at the moment, but 
it won’t last. All these weeks the 
solar heat has been working its 
way through and we expect a 
sharp temperature rise to begin 
in a few hours. That’s not the prob- 
lem — by the time Commander 
Norton will have to leave the air 
will be no more than comfortably 
tropical.’’ 

“Then what’s the difficulty?’’ 

“I can answer in one word, Mr. 
Ambassador. Hurricanes.’’ 

T here were now more than 
twenty men and women inside 
Rama — six of them down on the 
plain, the rest ferrying equip- 
ment and expendables through 
the airlock system and down the 
stairway. The ship itself was al- 
most deserted, with the mini- 
mum possible staff on duty. The 
joke went around that Endeavor 



was really being run by the four 
simps and that Goldie had been 
given the rank of acting com- 
mander. 

For these first explorations 
Norton had established a num- 
ber of ground rules. The most im- 
portant dated back to the earliest 
days of man’s spacefaring. Every 
group, he had decided, must con- 
tain one person with prior expe- 
rience. But no more than one. In 
that way everybody would have 
an opportunity of learning as 
quickly as possible and substi- 
tutes would be available for possi- 
ble future emergencies. 

The first party to head for the 
Cylindrical Sea, led by Surgeon- 
Commander Laura Ernst, had as 
its one-time veteran Boris Rodri- 
go, just back from Paris. The third 
member. Sergeant Pieter Rous- 
seau, had been with the backup 
teams at the Hub — he was an ex- 
pert on space reconnaissance in- 
strumentation, but on this trip he 
would have to depend on his own 
eyes and a small portable tele- 
scope. 

From the foot of Stairway Al- 
pha to the edge of the sea was just 
under fifteen kilometers. Laura 
Ernst set a brisk pace. She stopped 
her team for thirty minutes at the 
midway mark and made the whole 
trip in a completely uneventful 
three hours. 

Walking in the beam of the 
searchlight through the anechoic 
darkness of Rama was also quite 
monotonous. As the pool of light 
advanced with the explorers it 
slowly elongated into a long, 
narrow ellipse — this foreshorten- 
ing of the beam was the only visi- 



50 



GALAXY 




ble sign of progress. If the observ- 
ers on the Hub had not given them 
continual distance checks, they 
could not have guessed whether 
they had traveled one kilometer 
or five or ten. They simply plod- 
ded through the million-year-old 
night over an apparently seam- 
less metal surface. 

But at last, far ahead at the lim- 
its of the weakening beam they 
saw something new. On a normal 
world it would have been a hori- 
zon. 

They were nearing the edge of 
the sea. 

“Only a hundred meters,” said 
Hub Control. “Better slow 
down.” 

They had already done so. 
From the level of the plain to the 
sea was a sheer straight drop of 
fifty meters. Although Norton 
had impressed upon everyone the 
danger of taking anything for 
granted in Rama, few doubted that 
the sea was really made of ice. But 
for what conceivable reason was 
the cliff on the southern shore five 
hundred meters high, instead of 
the fifty here? 

I T WAS as if they were ap- 
proaching the edge of the world 
- their oval of light, cut off ab- 
ruptly ahead of them, became 
shorter and shorter. But far out on 
the curved screen of the sea their 
monstrous foreshortened shadows 
appeared in magnified and ex- 
aggerated movement. Those 
shadows had been their compan- 
ions every step of the way, but now 
that they were broken at the edge 
of the duff they no longer seemed 
part of the humans who cast them. 



They might have been creatures of 
the Cylindrical Sea, waiting to 
deal with any intruders into their 
domain. 

From the edge of the fifty-me- 
ter cliff it was possible to ap- 
preciate fully the curvature of 
Rama. But no one had ever be- 
fore seen a frozen lake bent up- 
ward into a cylindrical sur- 
face — the image was distinctly 
unsettling and the eye did its best 
to find some other interpreta- 
tion. It seemed to Dr. Ernst, who 
had once made a study of visual il- 
lusions, that half the time she was 
really looking at a horizontally 
curving bay, not a surface that 
soared up into the sky. It required 
a deliberate effort of will to ac- 
cept the fantastic truth. 

Only in the line directly ahead, 
parallel to the axis of Rama, was 
normalcy preserved. In this di- 
rection alone was there agree- 
ment between vision and logic. 
Here — for the next few kilome- 
ters at least — Rama looked flat 
and was flat. And out there, be- 
yond their distorted shadows and 
the outer limit of the beam, lay 
the island that dominated the 
Cylindrical Sea. 

“Hub Control,” Dr. Ernst ra- 
dioed. “Please aim your beam at 
New York.” 

The night of Rama fell sudden- 
ly upon the team as the oval of 
light went sliding out to sea. Con- 
scious of the now invisible cliff at 
their feet, they all stepped 
back — and then, as if by magic, 
the towers of New York sprang in- 
to view. 

The resemblance to old-time 
Manhattan was only super- 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



51 




ficial — this star-born echo of 
Earth’s past possessed its own 
unique identity. The more Dr. 
Ernst stared at it, the more certain 
she became that it was not a city at 
all. 

The real New York, like all of 
man’s habitations, had never 
been finished — still less had it 
been designed. This place, how- 
ever, had an overall symmetry 
and pattern, though one so com- 
plex that it eluded the mind. It had 
been conceived and planned by 
some controlling intelligence — 
and then it had been completed, 
like a machine devised for some 
specific purpose. After that there 
was no possibility of growth or 
change. 

The beam of the searchlight 
slowly tracked along those dis- 
tant towers and domes, inter- 
locked spheres and criss-crossed 
tubes. Sometimes there would be a 
brilliant reflection as some flat 
surface shot the light back toward 
the viewers. The first time this 
happened they were taken by sur- 
prise. It was exactly as if some- 
one on that strange island were 
signaling to them. 

But they could see nothing here 
that was not already shown in 
greater detail on photographs 
taken from the Hub. After a few 
minutes they called for the light to 
return to them and began to walk 
east along the edge of the cliff. It 
was plausibly theorized that 
somewhere there had to be a flight 
of steps or a ramp leading down to 
the sea. And a sailor among the 
crewmen raised an interesting 
conjecture. 

“Where there’s a sea,’’ Ser- 



geant Ruby Barns predicted, 
“there must be docks and harbors 
— and ships. You can learn every- 
thing about a culture by studying 
the way it builds boats.’’ Her col- 
leagues thought this a rather re- 
stricted point of view, but at least 
it was a stimulating one. 

D r. ERNST had almost given 
up the search and was prepar- 
ing to make a descent by rope 
when Rodrigo spotted the narrow 
stairway. It could easily have 
been overlooked in the shadowed 
darkness below the edge of the 
cliff, for there was no guard rail or 
other indication of its presence. 
And it seemed to lead nowhere — it 
ran down the vertical wall at a 
steep angle and disappeared be- 
low the surface of the sea. 

They scanned the flight of steps 
with their helmet lights, could see 
no conceivable hazard, and D.r. 
Ernst got Commander Norton’s 
permission to descend. A min- 
ute later she was cautiously test- 
ing the surface of the sea. 

Her foot slithered almost fric- 
tionlessly back and forth. The 
material felt exactly like ice. It 
was ice. 

When she struck it with her ham- 
mer, a familiar pattern of cracks 
radiated from the impact point 
and she had no difficulty collect- 
ing as many pieces as she wished. 
Some had already melted when 
she held the sample holder to the 
light — the liquid appeared to be 
slightly turbid water. She took a 
cautious sniff. 

“Is that safe?’’ Rodrigo called 
down with a trace of anxiety. 
“Believe me, Boris,” she an- 



52 



GALAXY 




swered, “if there are any patho- 
gens around here that have slipped 
through my detectors dur insur- 
ance policies lapsed a week ago.” 
But Boris, she knew, had a point. 
Despite all the tests that had been 
carried out there was a risk that 
the substance might be poison- 
ous or might carry some unknown 
disease. In normal circum- 
stances Dr. Ernst would not have 
taken the chance. Now, however, 
time was short and the stakes were 
enormous. If it became neces- 
sary to quarantine Endeavor the 
price would be a small one to pay 
for her cargo of knowledge. 

“It’s water, but I wouldn’t care 
to drink it. It smells like an algae 
culture that’s gone bad. I can 
hardly wait to get it to the lab.” 

“Is the ice safe to walk on?” 
“Yes, solid as a rock.” 

“Then we can get to New 
York.” 

“Can we? Have you ever tried to 
walk across four kilometers of 
ice?” 

“I see what you mean. And 
there’s another problem — the 
temperature is already above 
freezing. Before long that ice is 
going to melt. How many space- 
men can swim four kilometers?” 

Dr. Ernst held up her small 
sample bottle in triumph. 

“It’s a long walk for a few cc’s of 
dirty water, but this may teach us 
more about Rama than anything 
we’ve found so far. Let's head for 
home.” 

They turned toward the distant 
lights of the Hub. Often they 
looked back, drawn by the hidden 
enigma of the island out there in 
the center of the frozen sea. 



Just once Dr. Ernst thought she 
felt the faintest suspicion of a 
breeze against her cheek. 

It did not come again and she 
quickly forgot all about it. 

X 

44 A S YOU know perfectly 

x\well. Dr. Perera,” said Dr. 
Bose in tone of patient resigna- 
tion, “few of us share your knowl- 
edge of mathematical meteor- 
ology. So please take pity on our 
ignorance.” 

“With pleasure.” Perera was 
unabashed. “I can explain it best 
by telling you what is going to 
happen inside Rama very soon. 
The solar heat pulse has reached 
the interior and the temperature 
is on the rise. According to my 
latest information it’s already 
above freezing point. The Cylin- 
drical Sea will soon start to thaw 
and, unlike bodies of water on 
Earth, it will melt from the bot- 
tom up. That may produce some 
odd effects, but I’m much more 
concerned with the atmosphere. 

“As it is heated the air inside 
Rama will expand — and will at- 
tempt to rise toward the central 
axis. And this is the problem. At 
ground level, although it’s ap- 
parently stationary, it’s actual- 
ly sharing the spin of Rama — over 
eight hundred kilometers an 
hour. As it rises toward the axis it 
will try to retain that speed — and 
it won’t be able to do so, of course. 
The result will be violent winds 
and turbulence — 1 estimate ve- 
locities of between two and three 
hundred kilometers an hour. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



53 




“Incidentally, very much the 
same thing occurs on Earth. The 
heated air at the equator — which 
shares the Earth’s spin — runs into 
the same problem when it rises 
and flows north and south." 

“Ah, the trade winds. I remem- 
ber them from my geography les- 
sons.” 

“Exactly. Rama will have Trade 
Winds- — with a vengeance. I be- 
lieve they’ll last only a few hours 
and then some kind of equilibri- 
um will be restored. Meanwhile, I 
should advise Commander Nor- 
ton to evacuate as soon as possi- 
ble. Here is the message I pro- 
pose sending . .” 

W ITH a little imagination. 
Commander Norton told 
himself, he could pretend that he 
was night-camping at the foot of 
some mountain in a remote 
region of Asia or America. The 
clutter of sleeping pads, collapsi- 
ble chairs and tables, portable 
power plant, lighting equipment, 
electrosan toilets and miscel- 
laneous scientific applaratus 
would not have looked out of place 
on an Earth expedition — es- 
pecially as the men and women 
around him were without life-sup- 
port systems. 

Establishing Camp Alpha had 
been hard work. Everything had 
had to be manhandled through 
the chain of airlocks, sledded 
down the slope from the Hub and 
then retrieved and unpacked. 
Sometimes, when the braking 
parachutes had failed, a consign- 
ment had ended up a good kilome- 
ter away out on the plain. 

Almost all this equipment 



would stay here, for the labor of 
carrying it back was unthink- 
able — in fact, impossible. Nor- 
ton felt an irrational shame at 
leaving so much human litter in 
this strangely immaculate place 
— but in the meantime he had 
a more immediate problem. 
During the last twenty-four hours 
he had received almost identical 
messages from both Mars and 
Earth. It seemed an odd coinci- 
dence — had his two wives been 
commiserating with each other? 
Rather pointedly each had re- 
minded him that even great heroes 
had family responsibilities. 

The commander picked up a col- 
lapsible chair and walked out of 
the pool of light into the darkness 
surrounding the camp. It was the 
only way he could get privacy. De- 
liberately turning his back on 
the organized confusion behind 
him, he began to speak into the 
recorder slung around his neck. 

“Original for personal file, 
dupes to Mars and Earth. Hello 
ddrlirig — yes, I know I’ve been a 
lousy correspondent, but I 
haven’t been aboard ship for a 
week. Apart from a skeleton crew, 
we’re all camping inside Rama, 
at the foot of the stairway we’ve 
christened Alpha. 

“1 have three parties scouting 
the plain, but we’ve made disap- 
pointingly slow progress. Every- 
thing has to be done on foot. I’d 
happily settle for a few electric 
bicycles. 

“You’ve met my medical offi- 
cer, Dr. Ernst — ’’ 

He paused uncertainly. Laura 
had met one of his wives, but which 
one? 



54 



GALAXY 




Erasing the sentence, he began 
again. 

“My medical officer, Dr. Ernst, 
led the first group to reach the 
Cylindrical Sea, fifteen kilometers 
from here. She found frozen water 
as we had expected — but you 
wouldn’t want to drink it. Dr. 
Ernst says it's a dilute organic 
soup, containing traces of almost 
any carbon compound you might 
care to name, as well as phos- 
phates and nitrates and dozens of 
metallic salts. There’s not the 
slightest sign of life — not even 
any dead micro-organisms. So we 
still know nothing about the bio- 
chemistry of the Ramans — though 
it was probably not wildly differ- 
ent from ours." 

Something brushed lightly 
against his hair. He had been too 
busy to get it cut and would have to 
do something about that before 
he next put on a space helmet . 

“You’ve seen the viddies of 
Paris and the other towns we’ve 
explored on this side of the 
sea — London, Rome, Moscow. 
It's impossible to believe that 
they were ever built for anything 
or anyone to live in. Paris looks 
like a giant storage depot. Lon- 
don is a collection of cylinders 
linked together by pipes con- 
nected to what are obviously 
pumping stations. Everything is 
sealed up and there’s no way of 
finding what’s inside without ex- 
plosives or lasers. We won’t try 
these until there are no alterna- 
tives. 

“As for Rome and Moscow — ’’ 

“Excuse me, skipper. Priority 
from Earth." 

What now? Norton asked him- 



self. Cant a man get a few min- 
utes to talk to his families? 

H e took the message from 
the sergeant and scanned it 
quickly to satisfy himself that it 
was not urgent. Then he read it 
again more slowly. 

What the devil was the Rama 
Committee? And why had he nev- 
er heard of it? He knew that all 
sorts of associations, societies 
and professional groups — some 
serious, some completely crack- 
pot — had been trying to get in 
touch with him. 

Two-hundred-kilometer winds — 
probably sudden onset — well they 
were something to think about. 
But it was hard to take them too 
seriously on this utterly calm night 
and it would be ridiculous for his 
people to run away like frightened 
mice when they were just starting 
effective exploration. 

Commander Norton lifted a 
hand to brush aside his hair, which 
had somehow fallen into his eyes 
again. Then he froze, the gesture 
uncompleted. 

He had felt a trace of wind sev- 
eral times in the last hour. It was 
so slight that he had completely 
ignored it — after all, he was the 
commander of a spaceship, not a 
sailing vessel. Until now the 
movement of air had not been of 
any conceivable professional 
concern. What would the long- 
dead captain of that earlier En- 
deavor have done in a situation 
such as this? 

Norton had often asked him- 
self that question at moments of 
crisis. Endeavor had been named 
after one of the most famous 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



55 




ships in history. During the last 
four hundred years there had been 
a dozen Endeavors of sea and 
two of space, but the ancestor of 
them all was the 370-ton Whitby 
collier that Captain James Cook, 
R.N. had sailed around the world 
between 1768 and 1771. 

With an absorbing curiosity — 
almost an obsession — Norton had 
read everything he could find 
about Cook. Cook had been not 
only a supreme navigator but a 
scientist and — in an age of brutal 
discipline — a humanitarian. At 
times like this Cook’s reassuring 
presence seemed very close. 

The sergeant waited patiently 
while his commander stared si- 
lently out into the night of Rama. 
It was no longer unbroken, for at 
two spots about four kilometers 
away the faint patches of light of 
exploring parties could be clear- 
ly seen. 

In an emergency, / can recall 
them within the hour, Norton 
told himself. And that surely 
should be good enough . 

He turned to the sergeant. “Take 
this message. Rama Committee, 
care of Spacecom. Appreciate 
your advice and will take precau- 
tions. Please specify meaning of 
phrase ‘sudden onset.’ Respect- 
fully, Norton, Commander, En- 
deavor." 

He waited until the sergeant 
had disappeared toward the 
blazing lights of the camp, then 
switched on his recorder again. 
But the train of thought was bro- 
ken and he could not get back into 
the mood. The letter would have 
to wait for some other time. 

It was not often that Captain 



Cook came to his aid when Nor- 
ton was neglecting his duty. But 
he suddenly remembered how 
rarely and briefly poor Elizabeth 
Cook had seen her husband in six- 
teen years of married life. Yet she 
had borne him six children — and 
had outlived them all. 

Norton’s wives, never more 
than . ten minutes away at the 
speed of light, had nothing to com- 
plain about. 

XI 

D uring the first “nights” on 
Rama it had not been easy to 
sleep. The darkness and the mys- 
teries it concealed were oppres- 
sive, but even more unsettling was 
the silence. Absence of noise is 
not a natural condition — all hu- 
man senses require some input. 
If they are deprived of it the mind 
manufactures its own substi- 
tutes. 

Many in Endeavor's crew had 
complained of strange sounds — 
even of voices — which were obvi- 
ously illusions, because instru- 
ments had recorded nothing. Dr. 
Ernst had finally prescribed a sim- 
ple cure — during sleeping periods 
the camp was now lulled by gentle, 
unobtrusive background music. 

Tonight Commander Norton 
found the cure inadequate. He 
kept straining his ears into the 
darkness and he knew what he was 
listening for. But though a very 
faint breeze did caress his face 
from time to time, there was no 
sound that could possibly be taken 
for that of a distant, rising wind. 
Nor did either of the exploring 
parties report anything unusual. 



56 



GALAXY 




At last, around ship's midnight, 
he fell asleep. There was always a 
man on watch at the communica- 
tions console, in case of any ur- 
gent messages. No other precau- 
tions seemed necessary. 

Not even a hurricane could have 
created the sound that did wake 
him — and the whole camp — in a 
single instant. It seemed that the 
sky was falling— or that Rama had 
split open and was tearing itself 
apart. First came a rending crack, 
then a long drawn-out series of 
crystalline crashes like a million 
glass houses being demolished. It 
lasted for minutes — it was still 
continuing, apparently moving 
away into the distance, when Nor- 
ton got to the message center. 

“Hub Control. What's hap- 
pened?" 

“Just a moment, skipper. It’s 
over by the .sea. We’re getting the 
light on it.” 

The searchlight began to swing 
its beam out across the plain. It 
reached the edge of the sea, then 
started to track along it, scanning 
around the interior of the world. 
It stopped a quarter of the way 
around the cylindrical surface. 

Up in the sky — or what the mind 
still persisted in calling the 
sky — something extraordinary 
was happening. At first it seemed 
to Norton that the sea was boil- 
ing. It was no longer static and 
frozen in the grip of an eternal 
winter. A huge area, kilometers 
across, was in turbulent move- 
ment. And it was changing 
color — a broad band of white was 
marching across the ice. 

Suddenly a slab perhaps a 
quarter of a kilometer on a side 



began to tilt upward like an open- 
ing door. Slowly and majesti- 
cally it reared into the sky, glitter- 
ing and sparkling in the beam of 
the searchlight. Then it slid back 
and vanished beneath the sur- 
face, while a tidal wave of foaming 
water raced outward in all direc- 
tions from its point of submer- 
gence. 

Not until then did Norton fully 
realize what was happening. The 
ice was breaking up. All these days 
and weeks the sea had been 
thawing far down in its depths. It 
was hard to concentrate because 
of the crashing roar that still filled 
the world and echoed around the 
sky, but he tried to think of a rea- 
son for so dramatic a convulsion. 
When a frozen lake or river 
thawed on Earth it was nothing like 
this. 

B ut the explanation became 
obvious enough after the fact. 
The sea was thawing from be- 
neath as the solar heat seeped 
through the hull of Rama. When 
ice turns into water it occupies 
less volume, so the sea had been 
sinking below the upper layer of 
ice, leaving it unsupported. The 
strain had been building up day by 
day and now the band of ice that 
circled the equator of Rama was 
collapsing like a bridge that had 
lost its central supports. It was 
splintering into hundreds of float- 
ing islands that would crash and 
jostle into each other until they, 
too, melted. Norton’s blood ran 
suddenly cold when he remem- 
bered the plans that were being 
made to reach New York by 
sledge. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



57 




The tumult was subsiding. A 
temporary stalemate had been 
reached in the war between ice and 
water. In a few hours, as the tem- 
perature continued to rise, the 
water would win and the last ves- 
tiges of ice would disappear. But 
in the long run ice would be the vic- 
tor as Rama rounded the sun and 
set forth once more into the inter- 
stellar night. 

Norton remembered to start 
breathing again. Then he called the 
party nearest the sea. To his relief. 
Lieutenant Rodrigo answered 
at once. No, the water hadn’t 
reached them. No tidal wave had 
come sloshing over the edge of the 
cliff. 

“So now we know,” he added 
calmly, “why there is a cliff.” 

Norton agreed silently, his mind 
briefly groping for reasons why 
the cliff on the southern shore was 
ten times higher — and unable to 
settle on one. 

The Hub searchlight contin- 
ued to scan around the world. The 
awakened sea was steadily calming 
and the boiling white foam no 
longer raced outward from cap- 
sizing ice floes. In fifteen more 
minutes the main disturbance 
was over. 

But Rama was no longer silent. 
It had awakened from its sleep and 
over and again there came the 
sound of grinding ice as one berg 
collided with another. 

Spring had been a little late, 
Norton told himself, but winter 
had ended. 

And there was that breeze again, 
stronger than ever. Rama had 
given him enough warnings. It was 
time to go. 



A she neared the halfway mark 
Norton once again felt grati- 
tude to the darkness that con- 
cealed the view above — and below. 
Though he knew that more than 
ten thousand steps still lay ahead 
of him and could picture the steep- 
ly ascending curve in his mind's 
eye, the fact that he could see only 
a small portion of it made the 
prospect more bearable. 

This was his second ascent and 
he had learned from his mistakes 
on the first. The great temptation 
was to climb too quickly in this 
low gravity — it was hard to adopt 
a slow, plodding rhythm. But un- 
less one did this muscles that one 
never knew existed started to pro- 
test, and it was necessary to take 
longer and longer periods of rest 
for them to recover. 

This time he had started with al- 
most painful slowness, moving 
like an old man. He had been the 
last to leave the plain and the oth- 
ers were strung out along the half- 
kilometer of stairway above 
him — he could see their lights mov- 
ing up the invisible slope ahead. 

He felt sick at heart at the failure 
of his mission and even now hoped 
that this retreat was only tempo- 
rary. When they reached the Hub, 
they could wait until any at- 
mospheric disturbances had 
ceased. Presumably a dead calm 
would reign there, as at the center 
of a cyclone, and they could wait 
out the expected storm in safety. 

He realized he was jumping to 
conclusions, drawing possibly 
dangerous analogies from Earth. 
The meteorology of a whole 
world, even under steady-state 
conditions, was a matter of enor-

mous complexity. After several 
centuries of study, terrestrial 
weather forecasting was still not 
reliable. And Rama was not mere- 
ly a completely novel system — it 
was undergoing rapid changes. 
The temperature had risen sever- 
al degrees in the last few hours. 
Still there was no sign of the prom- 
ised hurricane, though a few 
feeble gusts had come from appar- 
ently random directions. 

They had climbed five kilome- 
ters when, at the third level, three 
kilometers from the axis, they 
paused to rest for an hour, taking 
light refreshments and massaging 
leg muscles. This was the last 
point at which they could breathe 
in comfort. They had left their 
oxygen supplies here and now put 
them on for the final ascent. 

An hour later they had reached 
the top of the stairway — and the 
beginning of the ladder. Ahead 
lay the last vertical kilometer, 
fortunately in a gravity field only 
a few per cent of Earth's. Another 
thirty-minute rest, a careful 
check of oxygen and they were 
ready for the final lap. 

Once again Norton made sure 
that all his men were safely ahead 
of him, spaced out at twenty-meter 
intervals along the ladder. From 
now on it would be a slow, steady 
haul, extremely boring. The best 
technique was to empty the mind 
of all thoughts and to count the 
rungs as they drifted by — one hun- 
dred, two hundred, three hun- 
dred, four hundred. 

He had reached twelve hundred 
and fifty when he suddenly re- 
alized that something was wrong. 
The light shining on the vertical 



surface immediately before his 
eyes was the wrong color — and it 
was much too bright. 

Norton did not have time to 
check his ascent or to call a warn- 
ing to his men. Everything hap- 
oened in less than a second. 

In a soundless concussion of 
t dawn burst upon Rama. 

T he light was so brilliant that 
for a full minute Norton had to 
keep his eyes tightly shut. When he 
risked opening them he had to 
blink and wait for involuntary 
tears to drain away before he 
turned slowly to behold the dawn. 

He could endure the sight for 
only a few seconds before he was 
forced to close his eyes again. It 
was not the glare that was intoler- 
able — but the awesome spectacle 
of Rama, now viewable for the 
first time in its entirety. 

Norton had known exactly what 
to expect — nevertheless the sight 
was at once stunning and dis- 
orienting. He was seized by a 
spasrn of uncontrollable trem- 
bling. His hands tightened around 
the rungs of the ladder. His legs 
felt ready to give. Except for the 
low gravity he might have fallen. 

Then his training took over and 
he began to apply the first remedy 
for panic. Keeping his eyes shut 
and trying to forget the mon- 
strous spectacle around him, he 
started to take deep, long breaths. 
Presently he felt much better, but 
he did not open his eyes until he 
had performed one more action. 
It took a major effort of will to 
force his right hand to open — he 
had to talk to it as to a disobedi- 
ent child — but presently he maneu-

vered it down to his waist, un- 
dipped the safety belt from his har- 
ness and hooked the buckle to the 
nearest rung. Now, whatever hap- 
pened, he could not fall. 

Norton switched on his radio. 
He hoped his voice sounded calm 
and authoritative as he said, “The 
captain speaking. Is everyone 
okay?” 

As he called out and checked off 
the names one by one his con- 
fidence and control returned. 

“Keep your eyes shut until 
you’re quite sure you can stand 
it — the view is overwhelming. 
Anyone who finds it’s too 
much — continue climbing with- 
out looking back. Keep in mind 
that you’ll soon be at zero gravity, 
where falling is impossible.” 

The thought of zero gravity was 
a kind of talisman now. 

It became an urgent matter of 
pride and self-esteem for Norton 
to open his eyes once more and 
look at the world around him. He 
let go of the ladder with both 
hands and hooked his left arm un- 
der a rung. Clenching and un- 
clenching his fists, he waited until 
the muscle cramps had vanished. 
When he felt quite comfortable 
he turned to face Rama. 

His first impression was one of 
blueness. The glare that filled the 
sky could not have been mistaken 
for sunlight — it might have been 
that of an electric arc. He sudden- 
ly understood the purpose of those 
mysterious trenches — Straight 
Valley and its companions were 
gigantic light strips. Rama had six 
linear suns, symmetrically ar- 
ranged around its interior. A 
broad fan of light was aimed from 



each, across the central axis to 
shine on the far side of the world. 
Norton wondered if the lights 
could be switched alternately to 
produce a cycle of day and dark- 
ness — or was Rama, awakened, 
a world of perpetual day ? 

T OO much staring at those 
blinding bars of light had made 
his eyes hurt again — he was not 
sorry to have a good excuse to 
close them for a while. It was not 
until he had recovered from the 
initial visual shock that he was able 
to devote himself to a much more 
serious problem. 

Who — or what — had switched 
on the lights of Rama? 

This world was sterile by the 
most sensitive tests that man 
could apply to it. But now some- 
thing was happening that could 
not be explained by the action of 
natural forces. There might not be 
life here, but there could be con- 
sciousness, awareness — robots 
might be waking after a sleep of 
eons. Perhaps this outburst of 
light was an unprogramed, ran- 
dom spasm — a last dying gasp of 
machines that, were responding 
wildly to the warmth of a new sun 
and would soon lapse again into 
quiescence, this time forever. 

Yet Norton could not believe 
such a simple explanation. Bits 
of the puzzle were beginning to 
fall into place, though many items 
were still missing. The absence of 
all signs of wear and the feeling of 
newness, the sense that Rama had 
just been created, remained unex- 
plained. 

He began a careful inventory of 
everything he saw. 



60 



GALAXY 




First he had to establish some 
kind of reference system. He was 
looking at the largest enclosed 
space ever seen by man and needed 
a mental map to find his way 
around it. The feeble gravity was 
little help — with an effort of will 
he could switch up and down in any 
direction he pleased. But some di- 
rections were psychologically 
dangerous. Whenever his mind 
skirted these he had to vector it 
away hastily. 

Safest of all was to imagine that 
he was at the bowl-shaped bottom 
of a gigantic well, sixteen kilo- 
meters wide and fifty deep. The ad- 
vantage of this image was that 
there could be no danger of his 
falling farther. Nevertheless, it 
had some serious defects. 

He could pretend that the scat- 
tered towns and cities and the dif- 
ferently colored and textured 
areas were all securely fixed to 
the towering walls. The various 
complex structures that could be 
seen hanging from the dome over- 
head need be no more disconcert- 
ing than the pendent chandelier 
in some great concert hall on 
Earth. What was quite unaccept- 
able was the Cylindrical Sea. 

There it was, halfway up the 
wellshaft — a band of water 
wrapped completely around it 
and with no visible means of sup- 
port. It was a vivid blue, flecked 
with brilliant sparkles from the 
few remaining ice floes. But a 
vertical sea forming a complete 
circle twenty kilometers in the 
sky was such an unsettling phe- 
nomenon that after a while he be- 
gan to seek an alternative. 

That was when his mind 



switched the scene through ninety 
degrees. Instantly the deep well 
became a long tunnel, capped at 
either end. “Down” was obvious- 
ly in the direction of the ladder 
and stairway he had just ascended. 
And from this perspective Nor- 
ton was at last able to appreciate 
the true vision of the architects 
who had built this place. 

H e was clinging to the face of 
a curving, high cliff, the upper 
half of which overhung completely 
until it merged into the arched 
roof of what was now the sky. Be- 
neath him the ladder descended 
more than five hundred meters un- 
til it ended at the first ledge or ter- 
race. From there the stairway con- 
tinued almost vertically through 
its low-gravity regime, slowly be- 
coming less and less steep until, 
after breaking at five more plat- 
forms, it reached the distant plain. 
For the first two or three kilo- 
meters the individual steps were 
visible. Thereafter they merged 
into a continuous band. 

The downward swoop of that im- 
mense stairway was so over- 
whelming that it was impossible 
to appreciate its true scale. Nor- 
ton had once flown around Mount 
Everest. He reminded himself 
that this stairway was as high as 
the Himalayas, but found the com- 
parison meaningless. 

And no comparison at all was 
possible with the other two stair- 
ways, Beta and Gamma, which 
slanted up into the sky and then 
curved far out over his head. Nor- 
ton had now acquired enough con- 
fidence to lean back and glance up 
at them — briefly. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA

Then he tried to forget that they 
were there. 

Too much thinking along those 
lines evoked yet a third image of 
Rama, one he was anxious to 
avoid at all costs. It regarded Ra- 
ma as a vertical cylinder, but now 
he was at the top, with a fifty-kilo- 
meter drop immediately below. 
Every time Norton found this 
image creeping up on him he 
needed all his willpower to keep 
from clinging to the ladder again 
in mindless panic. 

In time, he was sure, all these 
fears would ebb. The wonder and 
strangeness of Rama would ban- 
ish its terrors for men trained to 
face the realities of space. 

He looked at his chronometer. 
His pause for orientation had 
lasted only minutes, but had 
seemed a lifetime. Exerting bare- 
ly enough effort to overcome his 
inertia and the fading gravita- 
tional field, he started to pull him- 
self slowly up the last hundred 
meters of the ladder. Just before 
he entered the airlock and turned 
his back upon Rama he decided 
to make one final swift survey of 
the interior. 

It had changed even in the last 
few minutes. A mist was rising 
from the sea. For the first few hun- 
dred meters the ghostly white 
columns were tilted sharply for- 
ward in the direction of Rama's 
spin. Then they started to dissolve 
in a swirl of turbulence as the up- 
rushing air tried to jettison its ex- 
cess velocity. The trade winds of 
this cylindrical world were begin- 
ning to etch their patterns in its 
sky — the first tropical storm in 
unknown ages was about to break. 



F or the first time in weeks ev- 
ery member of the Rama Com- 
mittee had made himself avail- 
able. Professor Solomons had 
emerged from the depths of the 
Pacific, where he had been study- 
ing mining operations along mid- 
ocean trenches. And, to nobody’s 
surprise. Dr. Taylor had reap- 
peared now that there was at least 
a possibility that Rama held some- 
thing more newsworthy than life- 
less artifacts. 

The chairman had fully expected 
Dr. Carlisle Perera to be even 
more dogmatically assertive 
than usual now that his prediction 
of a hurricane in Rama had been 
confirmed. To Dr. Bose’s great 
surprise, Perera was remarkably 
subdued and accepted the con- 
gratulations of his colleagues in a 
manner as close to embarrassed 
modesty as he was ever likely to 
achieve. 

The exobiologist was, in fact, 
deeply mortified. The spectacu- 
lar breakup of the Cylindrical 
Sea’s ice was a much more obvious 
phenomenon than the hurricane 
winds — yet he had completely 
overlooked it. To have remem- 
bered that hot air rises, but to have 
forgotten that hot ice contracts, 
was not an achievement of which 
he could be proud 

When the chairman offered him 
the floor and asked what further 
climatic changes he expected Pe- 
rera was careful this time to hedge 
his bets. 

“You must realize,’’ he ex- 
plained, “that the meteorology of 



62 



GALAXY 




a world as strange as Rama may 
have many other surprises. But if 
my calculations are correct there 
will be no further storms and con- 
ditions will soon be stable. There 
will be a slow temperature rise 
until perihelion — and beyond — 
but that won’t concern us. En- 
deavor will have had to leave long 
before then.” 

“So it should soon be safe to go 
back inside?” 

“Probably. We should certain- 
ly know in forty-eight hours.” 

“A return is imperative,” said 
the member from Mercury. “We 
have to learn everything we pos- 
sibly can about Rama. The situa- 
tion has now changed complete- 
ly” 

“I think we know what you 
mean, but would you care to 
elaborate?” 

“Of course. Until now we have 
assumed that Rama is lifeless, or 
at any rate uncontrolled. But we 
can no longer pretend that it is a 
derelict. It may be directed by ro- 
bot mechanisms programed to 
carry out some mission — per- 
haps one highly disadvantageous 
to us. Unpalatable though it may 
be, we must consider the ques- 
tion of self-defense.” 

A babble of protesting voices 
rose and Dr. Bose had to hold up 
his hand to restore order. 

“Whether we like the idea or 
not, the suggestion should be con- 
sidered seriously,” he called out. 

“With all due respect,” said Dr. 
Conrad Taylor in his most disre- 
spectful voice, “1 think we can rule 
out as naive the fear of malevolent 
intervention. Creatures as 
advanced as the Ramans must 



have correspondingly developed 
morals. Otherwise they would 
have destroyed themselves — as we 
nearly did in the twentieth cen- 
tury. I’ve made that quite clear in 
my new book Ethos and Cosmos. 
I hope you received your copy.” 
“Yes, thank you, though I’m 
afraid the pressure of other mat- 
ters has not allowed me to read be- 
yond the introduction. How- 
ever, I’m familiar with the gener- 
al thesis. We may have no male- 
volent intentions toward an ant 
colony. But if we want to build a 
house on the site occupied by 
one — ” 

“This is as bad as the Pandora 
Party! It’s nothing less than inter- 
stellar xenophobia — ” 

“Please, gentlemen! This is get- 
ting us nowhere. Mr. Ambas- 
sador, you still have the floor.” 

T he chairman glared across 
three hundred and eighty thou- 
sand kilometers of space at Con- 
rad Taylor, who reluctantly sub- 
sided. 

“Thank you,” said the member 
from Mercury. “The danger may 
be unlikely, but where the future 
of the human race is involved we 
can take no chances. , And we 
Hermians are particularly con- 
cerned. We may have more cause 
for alarm than anyone else.” 

“Why. Mercury, more than any 
other planet?” asked the chair- 
man. 

“Look at the dynamics of the sit- 
uation. Rama is already inside 
our orbit. It is only an assump- 
tion that it will go around the sun 
and head out again into space. 
Suppose it carries out a braking 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



63 




maneuver. If it does so, this will 
occur at perihelion, about thirty 
days from now. My scientists tell 
me that if the entire velocity 
change is carried out there Rama 
will end up in a circular orbit only 
twenty-five million kilometers 
from the sun. From there it could 
dominate the solar system.” 

For a long time nobody — not 
even Conrad Taylor — spoke a 
word. All the members of the 
committee were marshaling their 
thoughts about those difficult peo- 
ple, the Hermians. 

To most people Mercury was a 
fairly good approximation of 
hell — at least it would do until 
something worse came along. But 
the Hermians were proud of their 
bizarre planet, of its days longer 
than its years, its double sunrises 
and sunsets and its rivers of 
molten metal. By comparison the 
moon and Mars had been almost 
trivial challenges. Not until men 
landed on Venus (if they ever did) 
would they encounter an en- 
vironment more hostile than that 
of Mercury. 

And yet this world had turned 
out to be in many ways the key to 
the solar system. The reasons for 
this seemed obvious in retro- 
spect, but the space age had been 
almost a century old before the 
fact was realized. Now the Her- 
mians never let anyone forget it. 

Long before men reached the 
planet. Mercury’s abnormal den- 
sity hinted at the heavy elements it 
contained — even so, its wealth was 
still a source of astonishment and 
had postponed for a thousand 
years any fears that the key metals 
of human civilization would be 



exhausted. And these treasures 
were in the best possible 
place — where the power of the sun 
was ten times greater than on frigid 
Earth. 

Unlimited energy and unlimited 
metal — that was Mercury. Its 
great magnetic launchers could 
catapult manufactured prod- 
ucts to any point in the solar sys- 
tem. It could also export energy in 
synthetic transuranium isotopes 
or pure radiation. It had even been 
proposed that Hermian lasers 
would one day thaw out gigantic 
Jupiter, but this idea had not been 
well received on the other worlds. 
A technology that could cook 
Jupiter had too many tempting 
possibilities for interplanetary 
blackmail. 

That such a concern had ever 
been expressed said a good deal 
about the general attitude to- 
ward the Hermians. They were re- 
spected for their toughness and en- 
gineering skills and admired for 
the way in which they had con- 
quered so fearsome a world. But 
they were not liked — and still less 
were they completely trusted. 

At the same time it was possible 
to appreciate their point of view. 
The Hermians, it was often joked, 
sometimes behaved as if the sun 
were their personal property. 
They were bound to it in an inti- 
mate love-hate relationship — as 
the Vikings had once been linked 
to the sea, the Nepalese to the 
Himalayas, the Eskimos to the 
tundra. They would be most un- 
happy if something came be- 
tween them and the natural force 
that dominated and controlled 
their lives. 




A t last the chairman broke 
the long silence. He took the 
Hermians very seriously indeed, 
even though he considered them 
uncouth technological barbar- 
ians. 

“I think there is some merit in 
your argument, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor,” he said slowly. “Have you 
any proposals?” 

“Yes, sir. Before we know what 
action to take we must have the 
facts. We know the geography of 
Rama — if one can use that 
term — but we have no idea of its 
capabilities. And the key to the 
whole problem is this; does Rama 
have a propulsion system? Can it 
change orbit? I’d be very interested 
in Dr. Perera’s views.” 

“I’ve given the subject a good 
deal of thought,"” answered the ex- 
obiologist. "‘Rama must have 
been given its original impetus by 
some launching device, but that 
could have been an external 
booster. If it does have onboard 
propulsion we’ve found no trace 
of it. Certainly there are no 
rocket exhausts — or anything 
similar — anywhere on the outer 
shell.” 

“They could be hidden.” 

“True, but there would seem lit- 
tle point in anyone’s having done 
so. And where are the propellant 
tanks, the energy sources? The 
main hull is solid — we’ve checked 
that with seismic surveys. The 
cavities in the northern cap are all 
accounted for by airlock systems. 

“That leaves the southern end of 
Rama, which Commander Nor- 
ton has been unable to reach ow- 
ing to that wide band of water. 
There are all sorts of curious 



mechanisms and structures on 
the South Pole — you’ve seen the 
photographs. What they are is 
anybody’s guess. 

“But I’m reasonably sure of this. 
If Rama does have a propulsion 
system it’s something complete- 
ly outside our present knowledge. 
In fact, it would have to be the 
fabulous ‘space drive’ people have 
been talking about for two hun- 
dred years.” 

“You wouldn’t rule that out?” 

“Certainly not. If we can prove 
that Rama has a space drive — even 
if we learn nothing about its mode 
of operation — that would be a 
major discovery. At least we’d 
know that such a thing is possi- 
ble.” 

“What is a space drive?” asked 
Sir Robert. 

“Any kind of propulsion sys- 
tem, Sir Robert, that doesn’t work 
on the rocket principle. Anti-grav- 
ity — if it is possible — would do 
very nicely. At present we don’t 
know where to look for such a 
drive and most scientists doubt it 
exists.” 

“It doesn’t,” Professor David- 
son interjected. “Newton settled 
that. You can’t have action 
without reaction. Space drives 
are nonsense. Take it from me.” 

“You may be right,” Perera re- 
plied with unusual blandness. 
“But if Rama doesn’t have a space 
drive it has no drive at all. There’s 
simply no room for a conven- 
tional propulsion system, with 
its enormous fuel tanks.” 

“It’s hard to imagine a whole 
world being pushed around,” said 
Dennis Solomons. “What would 
happen to the objects inside it? 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



65 




Everything would have to be 
bolted down. Most inconvenient.” 
“Well, the acceleration would 
probably be very low. The biggest 
problem would be the water in the 
Cylindrical Sea. How would you 
stop that from. .” 

P ERERA’S voice suddenly 
faded away and his eyes glazed 
over. He seemed to be in the throes 
of an incipient epileptic fit or even 
a heart attack. His colleagues 
looked at him in alarm. 

He made a sudden recovery, 
banged his fist on the table and 
shouted, “Of course! That ex- 
plains everything. The southern 
cliff— now it makes sense!” 

“Not to me,” grumbled the 
Lunar representative. 

“Look at this longitudinal cross- 
section of Rama," Perera con- 
tinued excitedly, unfolding his 
map. “Have you got your copies? 
The Cylindrical Sea is enclosed 
between two cliffs, which com- 
pletely circle the interior of Ra- 
ma. The one on the north is only 
fifty meters high. The southern 
one, on the other hand, is almost 
half a kilometer high. Why the 
big difference? No one’s been 
able to think of a sensible reason. 

“But suppose Rama is able to 
propel itself — accelerate so that 
the northern end is forward. The 
water in the sea would tend to 
move back — the level at the south 
would rise perhaps hundreds of 
meters. Hence the cliff. Let’s 
see — ” 

Perera started scribbling furious- 
ly. After an astonishingly short 
time he looked up in triumph. 
“Knowing the height of those 



cliffs we can calculate the max- 
imum acceleration Rama can 
take. If it were more than two per 
cent of a gravity the sea would 
slosh over into the southern con- 
tinent.” 

“A fiftieth of a gee? That’s not 
very much.” 

“It is — for a mass of ten million 
megatons. And it’s all you need 
for astronomical maneuvering.” 

“Thank you very much, Dr. Per- 
era,” the Hermian said. “You’ve 
given us a lot to think about. Mr. 
Chairman — can we impress on 
Commander Norton the impor- 
tance of looking at the South 
Polar region?” 

“He’s doing his best. The sea is 
the obstacle, of course. They’re try- 
ing to build some kind of raft so 
that they can at least reach New 
York.” 

“The South Pole may be even 
more important. Meanwhile, 1 
am going to bring these matters 
to the attention of the general as- 
sembly. Do I have your ap- 
proval?” 

There were no objections, not 
even from Dr. Taylor. But just as 
the committee members were 
about to switch out of circuit. Sir 
Lewis raised his hand. 

The old historian seldom spoke. 
When he did, everyone listened. 

“Suppose we do find that Rama 
is active and has these capa- 
bilities. There is an old saying in 
the military that capability does 
not imply intention.” 

“How long should we wait to 
find what Rama’s intentions 
are?” asked the Hermian. “When 
we discover them it may be too 
late.” 



66 



GALAXY 




“It is already too late. There is 
nothing we can do to affect Rama. 
I ndeed, I doubt if there ever was.” 
“1 do not admit that. Sir Lewis. 
There are many things we can 
do — if it proves necessary. But the 
lime is desperately short. Rama 
is a cosmic egg being warmed by 
the fires of the sun. It may hatch 
at any moment.” 

The chairman of the committee 
looked at the ambassador for 
Mercury in frank astonishment. 
He had seldom been so surprised 
in his diplomatic career. 

He would never have dreamed a 
Hermian capable of such a poetic 
night of imagination. 



XHl 

W HEN one of his crew called 
him “Commander” or, 
worse still, “Mr. Norton” some- 
thing serious was afoot. Norton 
could not recall that Boris 
Rodrigo had ever before 
addressed him in such a fashion. 
So whatever was on Rodrigo’s 
mind, obviously the man consid- 
ered it to be of the gravest impor- 
tance. 

“What’s the problem, Boris?” 
“I'd like permission. Com- 
mander, to use ship priority for a 
direct message to Earth.” 

The request was unusual, 
though not unprecedented. 
Routine signals went to the 
nearest planetary relay — at the 
moment they were working 
through Mercury — and even 
though the transit time was only a 
matter of minutes, it was often 
five or six hours before a message 



arrived at the desk of the person 
for whom it was intended. Ninety- 
nine per cent of the time that was 
quite good enough. In an emer- 
gency more direct — and much 
more expensive — channels could 
be employed at the captain’s dis- 
cretion. 

“You know, of course,' that you 
have to give me a good reason. All 
our available bandwidth is al- 
ready clogged with data transmis- 
sions. Is this a personal emer- 
gency?” 

“No, Commander. It’s much 
more important. I want to send a 
message to the Mother Church.” 

“I’d be glad if you’ll explain.” 

It was not mere curiosity that 
prompted Norton’s request. If he 
acceeded to Boris’ request he 
would have to justify his action. 

The calm blue eyes stared into 
his. He had never known Boris to 
lose control, to be other than 
completely self-assured. All the 
Cosmo-Christers were like 
this — it was one of the qualities 
that made them good spacemen. 
Sometimes, however, their un- 
questioning certainty was just a 
little annoying to those who had 
not been vouchsafed the Reve- 
lation. 

“It concerns the purpose of 
Rama, Commander. I believe I 
have discovered it.” 

“Goon.” 

“Look at the situation. Here is 
a completely empty, lifeless 
world — yet it is suitable for 
human beings. It has water and an 
atmosphere we can breathe. It 
comes from the remote depths of 
space, is aimed precisely at the 
solar system — something quite in-

credible if we attribute it to pure 
chance. And it appears not only 
new — it looks as if it has never 
been used.” 

“We’ve all been through this 
dozens of times,” Norton said. 
“What can you add to it?” 

“Our faith has told us to expect 
such a visitation, though we do not 
know exactly what form it will 
take. The Bible gives hints. If this 
is not the Second Coming it may 
be the Second Judgment — the 
story of Noah repeated. I believe 
that Rama is a cosmic Ark, sent 
here to save those who are worthy 
of salvation.” 

T he silence in the captain’s 
cabin lasted for quite a while. 
Not that Norton was at a loss for 
words — rather, he could think of 
too many questions. But he was 
not sure which would be tactful to 
ask. Stripped of its religious over- 
tones, Rodrigo’s theory was at 
least as convincing as a half- 
dozen others he had heard. 

“A couple of questions, Boris. 
Rama will be at perihelion in three 
weeks — then it will round the sun 
and leave the solar system just 
as fast as it came in. There’s not 
much time for a Day of Judgment, 
or for shipping across those who 
have been — ah— selected — however 
that’s going to be done.” 

“Very true. So when it reaches 
perihelion, Rama will have to de- 
celerate and go into a parking or- 
bit — probably one with aphelion 
at Earth’s orbit. There it might 
make another velocity change 
and rendezvous with Earth.” 

The possibility was disturbing- 
ly persuasive. Others had men- 



tioned it. if Rama wished to re- 
main in the solar system it was go- 
ing the right way about it. The 
most efficient way for it to slow 
down was to get as close to the sun 
as possible and carry out the brak- 
ing maneuver there. If there were 
any truth in Rodrigo’s theory — or 
some variant of it— it would soon 
be put to the test. 

“One other point, Boris. What's 
controlling Rama now?” 

“There is no doctrine to advise 
on that. It could be a pure robot. 
Or it could be — a spirit. That 
would explain why there are no 
signs of biological life.” 

The Haunted Asteroid . Why 
had that phrase popped up from 
the depths of memory? Norton re- 
called a silly story he had read 
years ago — he thought it best not 
to ask Boris if he had ever run into 
it. 

“I’ll tell you what we’ll do, 
Boris.” Norton abruptly made up 
his mind. He wanted to terminate 
this interview before it became 
too difficult. “Can you sum up 
your ideas in less than — oh, a 
thousand bits?” 

“Yes, I think so.” 

“Well, if you can make it sound 
like a straightforward scientific 
theory I’ll send it, top priority, to 
the Rama Committee. A copy can 
go to your Church at the same time 
and everyone will be happy.” 
“Thank you. Commander, 1 
really appreciate it.” 

“Oh, I’m not doing this to save 
my conscience. I’d just like to see 
what the committee makes of it. 
Even if I don’t agree with you all 
along the line you may have hit on 
something important.”

“Well, we'll know at perihelion, 
won't we?” 

“Yes. We’ll know at perihelion.” 
When Boris Rodrigo had left, 
Norton called the bridge and gave 
the necessary authorization. He 
thought he had solved the problem 
rather neatly. Besides, Just sup- 
pose that Boris were right. 

He might have increased his 
chances of being among the saved. 

A S HE drifted along the now 
familiar corridor of the Alpha 
airlock complex Norton won- 
dered if he had let impatience 
overcome caution. He had waited 
aboard Endeavor for forty-eight 
hours — two precious days — ready 
for instant departure if events 
should Justify it. But nothing had 
happened. The instruments left 
in Rama had detected no unusual 
activity. Frustratingly, the tele- 
vision camera on the Hub had been 
blinded by a fog which had re- 
duced visibility to a few meters and 
had only now started to retreat. 

When he had passed the final 
airlock and floated out into the 
cat’s-cradle of guide ropes around 
the Hub, Norton was struck first 
by the change in the light. It was no 
longer harshly blue, but was much 
more mellow and gentle, remind- 
ing him of a bright, hazy day on 
Earth. 

He looked out along the axis of 
this world and could see nothing 
except a glowing, featureless 
tunnel of white, reaching all the 
way to those strange mountains at 
the South Pole. The interior of 
Rama was completely blanketed 
with clouds and nowhere was a 



break visible in the overcast. The 
top of the layer was quite sharply 
defined — it formed a smaller 
cylinder inside the larger one of 
this spinning world, leaving a cen- 
tral core five or six kilometers 
wide quite clear, except for a few 
stray wisps of cirrus. 

The immense tube of cloud was 
lit from within by the six artificial 
suns of Rama. The locations of 
the three on this northern conti- 
nent were clearly defined by dif- 
fuse strips of light, but those on the 
far side of the Cylindrical Sea 
merged together into a con- 
tinuous, glowing band. 

What was happening down be- 
neath those clouds? The storm had 
now died away. Unless there were 
some other surprises it would be 
safe to descend. 

It had seemed appropriate to 
Norton, on this return visit, to 
use the team that had made the 
first deep penetration into Rama. 
As he watched Mercer, Calvert 
and Myron “swimming” quickly 
and confidently down the ladder 
he reminded himself of how much 
had changed. The first time they 
had descended in cold and dark- 
ness — now they were going toward 
light and warmth. And on all 
earlier visits they had been confi- 
dent that Rama was dead. That 
might yet be true in a biological 
sense. But something was stir- 
ring — and Boris Rodrigo's con- 
cept would do as well as any other. 

The spirit of Rama was awake. 

W HEN the team had reached 
the platform at the foot of 
the ladder and was preparing to 
start down the stairway Mercer 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



69 




carried out his usual routine test of 
the atmosphere. There were some 
things he never took for 
granted — even when the people 
around him were breathing per- 
fectly comfortably and without 
aids he had been known to stop for 
an air check before opening his 
helmet. When asked to justify 
such excessive caution, he had 
answered: “Because human senses 
aren’t good enough. You may 
think you’re fine and you could fall 
flat on your face with the next deep 
breath.’’ 

He looked at his meter and said, 
“Damn!” 

“What’s the trouble?” asked 
Calvert. 

“It’s broken — reading too high. 
Odd, I’ve never known that to 
happen before. I’ll check it on my 
breathing circuit.” 

He plugged the compact little 
analyzer into the test point on his 
oxygen supply, then stood in 
thoughtful silence. 

He unplugged the meter, used it 
to sample the Rama atmosphere 
again, then called Hub Control. 

“Skipper — will you take an oh- 
two reading?” 

A much longer pause ensued 
than the request justified. Finally 
Norton radioed back: “I think 
there’s something wrong with my 
meter.” 

A slow smile spread across Mer- 
cer’s face. 

“It’s up fifty per cent, isn’t it?” 

“Yes. What does that mean?” 

“It means that we can all take 
off our masks. Isn’t that con- 
venient?” 

I’m not sure,” replied Norton, 
echoing the sarcasm in Mercer’s 



voice. “It seems too good to be 
true.” 

He had no need to say more. 
Mercer cracked his mask open a 
trifle and took a cautious sniff. For 
the first time at this altitude the 
air was perfectly breathable. The 
musty, dead smell had gone — so 
had the excessive dryness, which 
in the past had caused several 
respiratory complaints. Humidity 
was now an astonishing 
80 % — doubtless the thawing of 
the sea was responsible for this. 
There was a muggy feeling in the 
air, though not an unpleasant one. 
It was like a summer evening, 
Mercer told himself, on some 
tropical coast. The climate inside 
Rama had improved dramatically 
during the last few days. 

But why? The increased humid- 
ity presented no mystery — the 
startling rise in oxygen was much 
more difficult to explain. As he 
recommenced the descent, Mer- 
cer began a series of mental cal- 
culations. He had not arrived at 
any satisfactory result by the 
time his team entered the cloud 
layer. 

It was a dramatic experience. 
The transition was abrupt. One 
moment they were gliding down- 
ward in clear air — then they shot 
suddenly into blinding white fog. 

Visibility dropped to a few 
meters. Mercer put on the brakes 
so quickly that Calvert almost 
bumped into him — and Myron did 
bump into Calvert, nearly 
knocking him off the rail. 

“Take it easy,” said Mercer. 
“Spread out so we can just see each 
other. And don’t let yourself 
build up speed.”

GALAXY 




I N EERIE silence they con- 
tinued to glide down through the 
fog. In some ways, this was even 
spookier than descending in the 
complete darkness of the Raman 
night — then, at least, the search- 
light beams had shown them what 
lay ahead. 

Mercer suddenly braked 
again. When they had bunched to- 
gether he whispered, “Listen. 
Don’t you hear something?” 

“Yes,” Myron said after a min- 
ute. “It sounds like wind.” 

Calvert was not sure. He turned 
his head, trying to locate the 
direction of the very faint mur- 
mur that had come to them 
through the fog, then abandoned 
the attempt as hopeless. 

They continued the slide, 
reached the fourth level and started 
on toward the fifth. All the while 
the sound grew louder — and more 
hauntingly familiar. They were 
halfway down the fourth stairway 
before Myron called out, “Now 
do you recognize it?” 

They would have identified it 
long ago, but it was not a sound 
they would ever have associated 
with any, world except Earth. 
Coming out of the fog, from a 
source whose distance could not 
be guessed, was the steady thunder 
of falling water. 

The party glided on. 

A few minutes later the cloud 
ceiling ended as abruptly as it had 
begun. They broke into the blind- 
ing glare of the Raman day, made 
more brilliant by the light reflected 
from the low-hanging clouds. 
There was the familiar curving 
plain — now made more acceptable 
to mind and senses by the fact that 



its full circle could not be seen. It 
was not too difficult to pretend 
that they were looking along a 
broad valley and that the upward 
sweep of the sea was really an out- 
ward one. 

They halted at the fifth and pen- 
ultimate platform to report that 
they were through the cloud cover 
and to make a careful survey. As 
far as they could tell nothing had 
changed down there on the 
plain — but up here on the northern 
dome Rama had brought forth an- 
other wonder. 

There was the origin of the 
sound they had heard. Descend- 
ing from some hidden source in the 
clouds three or four kilometers 
away was a waterfall. For long 
minutes the men stared at it si- 
lently, almost unable to believe 
their eyes. Logic told them that on 
this spinning world no falling ob- 
ject could move in a straight line, 
but there was something horribly 
unnatural about a waterfall that 
curved sideways, to end many 
kilometers away from the point 
directly below its source. 

“If Galileo had been born in this 
world,” said Mercer at length, “he 
would have gone crazy working 
out his laws of dynamics.” 

“I thought I knew them,” Cal- 
vert replied, “and I’m going crazy 
anyway. Doesn’t it upset you. 
Professor?” 

“Why should it?” said Sergeant 
Myron. “It’s a perfectly straight- 
forward demonstration of the 
Coriolis effect. 1 wish I could show 
it to some of my students.” 

Mercer was staring thought- 
fully at the globe-circling band of 
the Cylindrical Sea. 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA

“Have you noticed what’s hap- 
pened to the water?” he asked at 
last. 

“Why — it’s no longer so blue. 
I’d call it pea-green. What does 
that signify?” 

“Perhaps the same thing that it 
does on Earth. Laura called the sea 
an organic soup, waiting to be 
shaken into life. Maybe that’s ex- 
actly what’s happened.” 

“In a couple of days? The 
process took millions of years on 
Earth.” 

“Three hundred and seventy- 
five million, according to the 
best estimate. So that’s where the 
oxygen’s come from. Rama’s shot 
through the anerobic stage and 
has gotten to photosynthetic 
plants in about forty-eight hours. I 
wonder what it will produce to- 
morrow?” 

When they arrived at the foot 
of the stairway they had another 
shock. At first it appeared that 
something had gone through the 
camp, overturning equipment, 
even collecting smaller objects and 
carrying them away. But after a 
brief examination of the scene 
their alarm was replaced by 
shamefaced annoyance. 

The culprit was only the wind. 
Some ropes must have parted dur- 
ing exceptionally strong gusts. It 
was several days before they were 
able to retrieve all their scattered 
property. 

Otherwise there seemed no 
major changes. Even the silence of 
Rama had returned now that the 
ephemeral storms of spring were 
over. And out there at the edge of 
the plain was a calm sea — waiting 
for the first ship in a million years.

440 HOULDN’T one christen 
a new boat with a bottle of 
champagne?” 

“Even if we had any on board I 
wouldn’t allow such a criminal 
waste. Anyway, it’s too late. We’ve 
already launched the thing.” 

“At least it does float. You’ve 
won your bet, Jimmy. I’ll settle 
when we get back to Earth.” 

A pause while everyone gloated. 
“It’s got to have a name. Any- 
ideas?” 

The subject of these unflatter- 
ing comments was bobbing at the 
foot of the steps leading down in- 
to the Cylindrical Sea. It was a 
small raft, constructed from six 
empty storage drums held togeth- 
er by a light metal framework. 
Building it, assembling it at 
Camp Alpha and hauling it on 
demountable wheels across more 
than ten kilometers of plain had 
absorbed the crew’s entire 
energies for several days. It was a 
gamble that had better pay off. 

The prize was worth the risk. 
The enigmatic towers of New 
York, gleaming in the shadowless 
light five kilometers away, had 
taunted the explorers ever since 
they had entered Rama. No one 
doubted that the city — or what- 
ever it might be — was the real heart 
of this world. 

“We still don’t have a name. 
Skipper — what about it?” 

Norton laughed, then became 
suddenly serious. 

“I’ve got one for you. Call it 
Resolution.'’ 

“Why?” 



72 



GALAXY 




“That was one of Cook’s ships. 
It's a good name — maybe she'll 
live up to it.'' 

There was a thoughtful .silence. 
Then Sergeant Barnes, who had 
been principally responsible for 
the design — and who had the on- 
ly master’s certificate among En- 
deavor’s crew — asked for three 
volunteers. Everyone present 
held up a hand. 

“Sorry — we have only four life- 
jackets. Boris, Jimmy, Pieter — 
you’ve all done some sailing. Let’s 
try her out.’’ 

Ever since she had set eyes upon 
the Cylindrical Sea, Ruby Barnes 
had been determined to make this 
voyage. In all the thousands of 
years during which man had had 
dealings with the waters of his 
own world, no sailor had ever 
faced anything remotely like 
this. 

Her passengers took their 
places on the improvised bucket 
seats and Ruby opened the throt- 
tle. The twenty-kilowatt motor 
started to whirr — the chain drives 
of the reduction gear blurred and 
Resolution surged away to the 
cheers of the spectators. 

Ruby had hoped to get fifteen 
kph with this load, but would set- 
tle for anything over ten. A half- 
kilometer course had been mea- 
sured along the cliff and she made 
the round trip in five-and-a-half 
minutes. Allowing for turning 
time, this worked out at twelve kph 
and she was quite happy with that. 

With no power, but with three 
energetic paddlers helping her. 
Ruby was able to get a quarter of 
this speed. Even if the motor 
broke down they could get back to 



shore in a couple of hours. The 
heavy-duty power cells could pro- 
vide enough energy to circum- 
navigate this world and she was 
carrying two spares to be on the 
safe side. And now that the fog had 
completely burned away she was 
prepared to put to sea without a 
compass. 

She saluted smartly as she 
stepped ashore. 

“Maiden voyage of Resolu- 
tion successfully completed, sir. 
Awaiting your instructions.” 

“Very good. Admiral. When 
will you be ready to sail?” 

“As soon as stores can be loaded 
aboard and the harbor master 
gives us clearance.” 

“Then we leave at dawn.” 

“Aye, aye, sir.” 

F ive kilometers of water does 
not seem very much on a 
map — it looks entirely different 
when one is in the middle of it. 
The team had been cruising for 
only ten minutes and the fifty- 
meter cliff facing the northern 
continent already seemed a sur- 
prising distance away. Yet, 
mysteriously. New York hardly 
appeared much closer than be- 
fore. 

But most of the time Norton 
paid little attention to the 
land — he was too engrossed in the 
wonder of the sea. Whenever, he 
told himself, he felt that he had 
grown inured to Rama it produced 
some new wonder. As Resolu- 
tion hummed steadily forward it 
seemed to him that she was caught 
in the trough of a gigantic wave 
that curved up on either side until 



RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 



73 




it became vertical — then over- 
hung until the two flanks met in a 
liquid arch sixteen kilometers 
overhead. Despite everything 
that reason and logic told him he 
could not entirely throw off the 
impression that at any minute 
those millions of tons of water 
would come crashing down from 
the sky. 

Too, the water was now alive. 
Every spoonful contained thou- 
sands of spherical, single-celled 
micro-organisms, similar to the 
earliest forms of plankton that 
had existed in the oceans of Earth. 

Yet they showed puzzling dif- 
ferences. They lacked a nucleus, 
as well as many of the other mini- 
mum requirements of even the 
most primitive terrestrial life 
forms. And although Laura 
Ernst — now doubling as research 
scientist as well as ship’s doc- 
tor — had proved that they def- 
initely generated oxygen, there 
were far too few of them to ac- 
count for the augmentation of 
Rama's atmosphere. 

She had also discovered that 
their numbers were dwindling 
rapidly and must have been far 
higher during the first hours of the 
Raman dawn. It was as if there had 
been a brief explosion of life, re- 
capitulating on a trillionfold 
swifter time-scale the early his- 
tory of Earth. Now, perhaps, it 
had exhausted itself — the drift- 
ing micro-organisms were dis- 
integrating, returning their stores 
of chemicals to the sea. 

“If you have to swim for it,” Dr. 
Ernst had warned the mariners, 
“keep your mouths closed. A few 
drops won’t matter if you spit 



them out right away. But all those 
weird organo-metallic salts add 
up to a fairly poisonous pack- 
age — and I’d hate to have to work 
out an antidote.” 

This danger, fortunately, 
seemed very unlikely. Resolu- 
tion could stay afloat if any two of 
her buoyancy tanks were punc- 
tured. And even if she sank the 
crude but efficient lifejackets 
would keep the crew’s heads above 
water. Although Laura had been 
reluctant to give a firm ruling, 
she did not think that a few hours 
immersion in the sea would be fa- 
tal — but she did not recommend 
it. 

Presently New York ceased to 
be merely a distant island. It was 
becoming a real place. Details 
that until now had existed only 
as photo enlargements were now 
revealing themselves as mas- 
sive, solid structures. It was now 
strikingly apparent that the 
“city,” like so much of Rama, was 
triplicated — it consisted of three 
identical, circular complexes or 
superstructures rising from a 
long, oval foundation. Photo- 
graphs taken from the Hub also 
indicated that each complex was 
itself divided into three equal 
components, like a trisected pie. 
This would greatly simplify the 
task of exploration — presuma- 
bly one had to examine only one 
ninth of New York to have seen the 
whole of it. Even this would be a 
formidable undertaking — it 
would mean investigating at 
least a square kilometer of build- 
ings and machinery, some of 
which towered hundreds of me- 
ters into the air. 



74 



GALAXY 




T he Ramans, it seemed, had 
brought the art of triple-redun- 
dancy to a high degree of perfec- 
tion. This was demonstrated in 
the airlock system, the. stairways 
at the Hub, the artificial suns. 
And where it really mattered, 
they had even taken the next step. 
New York appeared to be an ex- 
ample of triple-triple redun- 
dancy. 

Ruby was steering Resolution 
toward the central complex, 
where a flight of steps led up from 
the water to the very top of the 
wall or levee that surrounded the 
island. There was even a con- 
veniently placed mooring post to 
which boats could be tied — when 
she saw this. Ruby became quite 
excited. Now she would never be 
content until she found one of the 
craft in which the Ramans sailed. 

Norton was the first to step 
ashore. He looked back at his three 
companions and said, “Wait here 
until 1 get to the top of the wall. 
Pieter and Boris will join me when 
1 signal. Sergeant Barnes will 
stay at the helm so that we can cast 
off at a moment’s notice. If any- 
thing happens to me, report to 
Karl and follow his instructions. 
Use your best Judgment — but no 
heroics. Understood?" 

“Yes, skipper. Good luck.” 
Norton did not really believe in 
luck, but once again Rama was 
forcing him to break some of his 
cherished rules. Almost every fac- 
tor here was unknown — and he 
could do with all the good wishes 
that happened to be lying around. 

The stairway was a virtual dup- 
licate of the one they had de- 
scended on their shore of the 



sea — doubtless his observers 
there were looking straight across 
at him through their telescopes. 
And “straight" was now the cor- 
rect word — in this one direction, 
parallel to the axis of Rama, the 
sea was indeed completely flat. 
It might well be the only body of 
water in the universe of which this 
was true, for on all other worlds 
every sea or lake must follow the 
surface of a sphere, with equal 
curvature in all directions. 

“Nearly at the top,” he re- 
ported, speaking for the record be- 
ing made five kilometers away. 
“Still completely quiet — radia- 
tion normal. I’m holding the 
meter above my head. Just in case 
this wall is acting as a shield. And 
if there are any hostiles on the 
other side, they’ll shoot that first." 

He was Joking, of course. But 
only for the record. Rama might 
still have the final laugh. 

When he took the last step he 
found that the flat-topped em- 
bankment was about ten meters 
thick. An alternating series of 
ramps and stairways led down to 
the main level of the city twenty 
meters below. In effect, he was 
standing on a high wall that com- 
pletely surrounded New York 
and so was able to get a grand- 
stand view. 

It was a view almost stunning in 
its complexity and his first act 
was to make a slow panoramic 
scan with his camera. Then he 
waved to his companions and ra- 
dioed back across the sea: “No sign 
of any activity — everything 
seems quiet. We are now about to 
enter the city.”

TRIGGERMAN 

Two men, each programed to bring 
Earth final peace— with honor! 



LOU FISHER 





T he gate in Real’s mind swung 
open, swung closed. 

The bombs were gone. He was 
back again on the silent planet 
(orange night, orange light?) at the 
chess table in the middle .of an 
endless desert. Across from him the 
naked creature sat quite still, its 
pointed chin resting easily on a two- 
fingered hand. 

“Your move. Real,” it said, the 
yellow mouth barely vibrating in a 
low monotonous whisper. 

“No, I won’t move,” Real replied. 
“We must have played a hundred 
games already. Maybe more. I am 
tired of playing chess and tired of 
losing.” He pressed his knuckles into 
the sandy texture of the chessboard. 
“I don’t even know what I’m doing 
here.” 

The creature stared back. 

“We are in the middle of a game. 
Real.” 

“I remember.” 

“It is your move.” 

“I remember that, too.” 

“Real-” 

“No!” He straightened in the 
chair, his arms folded defiantly. He 
knew what would happen. Still, once 
again he would be firm and stand his 
ground— but this time he wouldn’t 
give in. 

“You must move,” it said again. 
And then it waited. In the middle 
of the open land of a desert planet, it 
waited. Under the unfamiliar moon 
and the starless sky, where one small 
table and two chairs and two beings 
sat in a vast emptiness, it waited 



patiently, while the orange rays from 
no place spotlighted the black and 
white blocks of the chessboard, upon 
which intricate glass figures formed 
the pattern of contest. 

And Real shook his head. “I don’t 
do what I don’t want to do.” 

“You must play until you win.” 

“I’ll never win. I haven’t won in a 
hundred games and I won’t win if we 
play a hundred more. You know 
yourself that even if we play for- 
ever—” 

“Your move, please,” the creature 
insisted. 

“No. No way. I won’t touch those 
damn things.” 

“Too bad. Real.” 

The words were the warning. But 
Real told himself that this time he 
would withstand the fire. He felt 
strong. He would ignore the pain. 
Pain was only a feeling like coldness 
or softness, only a sense like hearing 
or seeing, only an emotion like terror 
or anger. It was a matter of condi- 
tioning yourself to absorb it. He was 
ready and now he would show them. 
Show whom? 

“Well, what are you waiting for?” 

The creature beckoned. 

The ball of fire appeared on the 
horizon, jumping and rolling in the 
sand. From it came a sobbing, wail- 
ing siren sound. Strangely enough, it 
did not appear to get bigger as it 
approached, as it crossed the entire 
desert in a moment or two, leaping 
and whirling and crying as it came. 
Not bigger but louder. Faster, nearer, 
louder and louder.

Keal waited and sweated. 

He stiffened. 

The weeping fire moved in. 

And then it was upon him, encir- 
cling and wrapping him. His skin 
burned. Hot blasts seared his eyes. 
Torture flooded his brain, pounding 
there, finally starting him screaming, 
struggling, kicking. The fire screamed 
more loudly. 

No more, he thought. Please take 
it away. He’d do anything. He’d 
move. He’d finish the game. 

Suddenly the air was clear and the 
pain was gone. Keal saw that his skin 
was unmarked. The fire had felt like 
napalm, but the only after-effects 
were the imprints scorched into his 
memory. That was bad enough. Keal 
turned slightly in his chair, picked up 
the white king’s knight, hooked it 
left and forward. 

“Thank you, Keal,” the other said, 
its two fingers reaching for the chess- 
board. 

It was very clear now that Keal 
had moved badly. He watched as the 
black crystal queen stormed the cen- 
ter of strength and turned the rem- 
nants of the white army into helpless 
bystanders. Keal was not surprised. 
He had seen it all before. His good 
move was, in retrospect, an amateur- 
ish play based on the obvious, over- 
looking the integral strategy of the 
battle. Why had he made it? 

The creature leaned forward. 
“Checkmate.” 

“I don’t care,” Keal answered. 
“What difference does it make?” 

“You lose again.” 



“I don’t care.” 

“You lose again and again and 
again . .” 

T he red-haired man walked out 
of the house and toward the car. 
He was dressed much as Keal was, in 
chino pants and a dark leather jacket. 
A canteen was slung over his left 
shoulder. His right hand held a rifle. 
The muzzle thrust through the open 
window and stopped six inches from 
Keal’s face. 

“Speak up, buddy,” the man said. 
“It’s me-Keal.” 

The rifle pulled back. The man 
leaned in. 

“Glad you made it. We’d better 
get going right away. Your car or 
mine?” 

Keal gave it some thought. “Well, 
I’ve been driving from Estes Park. If 
we take your car we can go with a 
full tank of gas.” 

“Hang on then. I’ll bring it 
around.” 

“You’re Anderson?” 

The man was already moving to- 
ward the garage. He glanced back, 
laughed and said, “Yeah, I’m Ander- 
son— or the last Anderson.” 

Keal knew what he meant. 

He rubbed his hands and waited in 
his own car, his gray eyes staring 
passively at the glow of death on the 
Colorado horizon. Far off. But not far 
enough. Billows of great mushrooms, 
blasting and echoing, licked by 
shooting towers of flame, rising in an 
awesome mass to cover the stars and 
to camouflage the destruction from

GALAXY 




the eyes of God. There and there and 
there— hell and atoms breaking loose. 
There and there— all the distance 
burning brightly. There again— the 
hydrogen flash that was sudden 
death. Chaos, heat and bitter poison. 

Something in Keal’s mind refused 
to let him panic. The post-hypnotic 
cloud that rendered him almost in- 
capable of fear, that had led him step 
by step to Anderson’s house, would 
continue to lead him the rest of the 
way. 

“Hey, let’s go,” Anderson was 
shouting. 

Keal turned. A car identical to his 
stood alongside, purring. Sleek and 
black and powerful and lead-lined, 
with cartons of canned goods stacked 
in the rear and an extra gas tank 
welded to the side. Matched cars. 
Matched men. A job to do. 

And nothing can stop us . 

Keal picked up his rifle and can- 
teen and switched to the other car. 
He leaned back in the passenger seat. 

“Do you know the way?” he 
asked. 

“Sure,” said Anderson. “Don’t 
you?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Well, don’t you?” 

“It depends on how you figure it,” 
Keal said. He braced himself as the 
car swung onto the highway and 
picked up speed. “I never heard of 
you, Anderson. But when this all 
started I packed up my gear and 
drove straight to your house. That’s 
the way it’s been. I don’t really know 
where I’m going, but I know why I’m 



going and I know how to get there.” 
“Post-hypnosis,” Anderson ex- 
plained. 

“Sure, now I know,” Keal said 
quietly. “And I’m just as glad they 
didn’t tell us before. So we wondered 
a little— it’s been a helluva good life. 
Subsidized playboys. All we had to 
do for our money was report to the 
Pentagon Medical Center once a 
month for treatment.” 

Anderson struggled with the 
wheel, roaring around a sharp curve 
in the road. 

“They went to a lot of trouble to 
get us ready,” he said when the car 
settled back to ninety. “It could have 
been a waste, but it turned out not 
to be. I’m glad it’s us, Keal. Look out 
there at that blazing hell.” He paused 
piously. “I want this job.” 

“It’s all right if you like temporary 
work,” Keal said with a cheerless 
smile. “How old are you?” 
“Thirty-two.” 

“I’m two years older,” Keal said. 
In the distance he saw another 
flash on the skyline, then the soaring 
bubble of smoke that marked the 
spot. Denver, maybe, full of agony. 
The screaming and the dying and the 
dead— and the dying and the dead 
and the dead. He turned on the 
radio, twisting the pointer from end 
to end. No response. He checked his 
watch. It was about three hours since 
the announcement of the surprise 
attack, the coming of war. Now even 
the emergency network was silent. 
“Just us,” he mused aloud. 
“H’mm?” said Anderson.

“We’re pretty much alone. Cut off 
from the rest of the world.” 

Anderson shook his head. “No, 
they’re cut off from us. We’re the 
important ones.” 

“Suppose we don’t make it.” 
“Nothing ca^ stop us.” 

“That’s what somebody keeps tell- 
ing me,” Keal said. “But a bomb—” 
“Bombs are for cities.” 

“They’re not always on target. 
And the radiation keeps spreading.” 
“Quit it,” Anderson said. “Noth- 
ing can stop us. So it . Well, 
remember, there are four others 
heading the same way. Someone will 
get through.” He half-smUed. “We’re 
the closest, you and me, and we’ll be 
there first. By the time the others 
come it’ll be all over. We can sit back 
and tell them how we killed every 
Commie in the world.” 

“And nothing can stop us,” Keal 
found himself saying. The words 
were not his own. Neither was the 
thought. Yet it was his brain that had 
shaped them and his tongue that had 
uttered them and it would be his 
hand that ... He wiped the sweat off 
the back of his neck. 



T he creature was carefully plac- 
ing the chessmen on their proper 
squares. One by one, fitted neatly 
into their defensive positions. 

“You have the white and move 
first,” it said, as if it had noticed no 
intermption. 

Keal’s face darkened. “Okay, I’ll 
show you how to play this game. 



This time I’m going to win.” 

The creature shrugged and waited. 
Keal concentrated on the board, de- 
termined that every move be perfect. 
Finally he selected the king’s pawn 
and moved it two squares forward. 

The creature countered without 
hesitation. 

The battle was on. Nothing else 
stirred in the great desert but the 
little glass things hopping backward 
and forward, diagonally and across, 
slowly and within limits, like grass- 
hoppers in chains. A pawn was lost 
and then a knight. A bishop. Another 
pawn. The pieces toppled one by 
one. 

Keal took a deep breath. He had 
led the creature into a trap. With the 
right move the game was his. He 
re-thought it to make sure— and when 
he was positive he took his white 
queen into enemy territory. 

Then he watched in complete dis- 
belief as the two fingers reached out 
and moved a black bishop into the 
vacated spot. 

“Checkmate,” said the creature. 

It was incredible, Keal told him- 
self. Why hadn’t he seen ahead? He 
should have won. Anyone in his right 
mind could have won that game. He 
laughed. Maybe that was the answer. 
Maybe no one here was in his right 
mind. 

“You lost again,” the creature was 
saying. 

“I don’t care,” Keal lied. “I just 
don’t care.” 

“You lost again and again and 
again ...”

T he high beams of the headlights 
bounced off scores of glossy 
road signs, zigged and zagged among 
trees and poles and concentrated on 
(he white center line that rolled on 
endlessly. Ninety miles of it each 
hour, on and on and on. 

Then suddenly the pattern was 
broken. 

Keal straightened, leaning forward 
to squint through the windshield. 
Some sort of obstmetion loomed 
iihead. Slowly it came into focus. 
Giant criss-crosses of thick lumber. 
Red, blinking lanterns. White helmets 
and white armbands on three men 
who were standing in front of the 
barricade, waving. 

Anderson saw it, too. 

He said, “A roadblock. Looks like 
civil defense.” 

“What do they want?” Keal won- 
dered. 

“Who the hell knows? We’re not 
waiting to find out.” Anderson twist- 
ed the big car to the middle of the 
road and kept the speed high and 
constant. 

Keal stared at him. “You’re not—” 
“H’mm?” Anderson’s lips were a 
thin, straight line. 

“You can’t just rip through 
them!” 

“Don’t bet on it, pal.” 

“For Chrissake— ” Keal reached 
quickly for the ignition key, but 
stopped when a glance showed him 
that he was much too late. The maze 
of red and white and sticks and limbs 
was directly in front of him, racing at 
him, arriving and expanding in dimly 



lighted cinemascope. He covered his 
eyes just before the impact. 

He heard the sounds of all against 
all. Thud of steel against wood. 
Clamor of shouts and broken glass. 
Hot spinning of tires. The heavy car 
shook, tore free and roared on. 
Through the rear window Keal look- 
ed at what was left behind. 

A man was draped across a snap- 
ped timber, his bloody face gro- 
tesque in the light of a swinging 
lantern. 

Another man was on his knees, 
shaking a fist. 

The third man was flat on the 
ground. 

Keal turned to the front and sat 
quietly for a moment, hoping that 
the scene would fade. His hands were 
cold. 

“That was a lousy thing to do, no 
matter what,” he said finally. 

The reply came with a shrug. 
“We’re too important to be stopped 
by them.” 

Keal knew it was true. He settled 
back and studied his partner. 

Sure we’re important. We’re the 
secret weapon. One touch of our 
fingers and there’ll be no conquerors. 
No one can bomb us and get away 
with it. And why? 

Because Keal and Anderson, 
hypnotized human robots, were on 
their way to a certain cave in a 
certain mountain to a certain trigger 
that would fill the sky with fiery 
rockets of retaliation. 

Button, button, who’s got the 
button?

His head was full of firm instruc- 
tions— pushing him, yelling at him, 
pleading with him. There was no rest 
from it. Post-hypnosis, the seed that 
bloomed when the bombs snapped 
their fingers and sent the tiniest army 
of all time marching to complete the 
last war. 

“So we killed a couple of guys on 
our side,” Anderson was explaining. 
“They’d be dead in a few days 
anyway. We’ll all be dead— you and 
me and everybody.” He stretched his 
arms on the steering wheel. “Want to 
drive for a while? I could use a 
break.” 

“Sure,” Keal said. When the car 
stopped he got out and walked 
around it. 

Anderson was already relaxed in 
the passenger seat with a can of cold 
beans and an opener. “Funny,” he 
said. “We’re ready to die and we still 
have to go on eating. But if we can 
make it to the trigger, if we can get 
every damn one of them-” 

“Nothing can stop us,” Keal re- 
peated automatically. 

Anderson gmnted and dug the 
spoon into the beans. Keal didn’t 
look at him again. He drove straight 
and fast, mulling over the implanted 
orders that kept him on the track. 

T he legs of the chess table were 
wedged into the barren sand. The 
chairs at either end were placed in 
perfect symmetry. The beacon of 
orange light formed a cone that 
reached to the sky where the faceless 



moon hung, ignoring the small spot 
of action. 

The creature arranged the thirty- 
two chessmen. The words sneaked 
from its yellow lips. “Take the first 
move, Keal.” 

It was time to play the game. 

“Dammit, no!” Keal said, glaring 
at his adversary. If he couldn’t win 
he had to stop playing. Somehow he 
had to break it up— to break out of 
this dream or whatever it was, to 
scramble the system. 

“Eventually you will make the 
move,” the creature said in a low 
tone. 

Keal shook his head. “I can’t keep 
playing. No more.” 

“Too bad, Keal.” 

It beckoned. 

Keal looked up to watch it come. 
Far off, someone struck a wooden 
match and the ball of fire was born. 
It skipped and danced, flared and 
wept. The siren sound rose higher. A 
wild spark, it skimmed across the 
empty planet with fantastic speed 
and deadly aim, coming hard at him, 
crying in its final lunge. Stinging fire 
everywhere. 

Keal clamped his teeth until his 
mouth bled. Then he yelled for 
mercy. 

All was quiet again. The pain 
vanished instantly. The creature 
calmly waited. 

Keal led a white pawn. He was 
sure now that he could never resist 
the fire— therefore he could never 
refuse to play. One move followed 
another. It occurred to Keal that the 



82 



GALAXY 




only way left to end the madness was 
to win a game. But he had used all 
his skill and he had always lost. Well, 
he would try again. At least it was 
better than the fire. 

“Your move, Keal,” it said con- 
stantly. 

“There’s a way to beat you,’’ he 
answered. “Some day I’ll find it.” 

S unrise. But the clouds were 
dark and sick. Keal felt his body 
tighten as he sensed the nearness of 
their destination. He stopped the car 
in a green, wooded valley. He had 
driven down a sloping hill— the other 
side was a high mountain. 

He put on the handbrake. “I guess 
we walk from here.” 

“Right,” said Anderson. “C’mon, 
let’s not waste time. We’ve got to be 
first.” 

Keal climbed out, but not hurried- 
ly- 

They took the rifles and the ra- 
tions and the voices in their heads 
and started up the mountain along a 
path that was mapped in their nerves. 
Up and up, and all the way they were 
watched by screeching birds and rab- 
bits on the run— ignorant beings who 
still had visions of tomorrow. 

Anderson climbed onto a jutting 
ledge and pulled Keal up after him. 
The ledge was wide enough and flat 
enough to let them walk side by side. 
They knew just how far to go. They 
knew just where to turn and stop. 
Briefly they studied a curtain of 
foliage, then used their rifle butts to 
hack their way through it. 



Keal followed Anderson into the 
cave. 

A switch at the entrance animated 
a string of lights that extended as far 
as Keal could see. Otherwise the cave 
was nothing spectacular. Made com- 
pletely by nature, its height and 
width and direction varied at nearly 
every step. But it was deep and 
traversing it took time— until finally 
it ended at a heavy steel door. 

Keal looked at the combination 
lock. 

He said, “There had to be some 
extra protection. I guess we’re sup- 
posed to think of the right num- 
bers.” 

“Let me try it,” Anderson offered. 

In a minute he had the door open. 

Keal’s eyes probed the large natu- 
ral room. At the center of the far 
wall, imbedded in rock— the trigger. 
No decorations, no intricate gadget- 
ry— just one short unmarked lever. 
That was all. But Keal could imagine 
the fantastic setup that lay beyond, 
that stretched from ocean to ocean. 

Anderson anxiously rubbed his 
hands. “I’ll flip you for the honor.” 

“Let’s wait a minute,” Keal said. 

“What for? To let the others get 
here? Not a chance.” 

“Well, we ought to think about 
what we’re doing.” 

“Think?” Anderson snapped. 
“Who the hell are you? The thinking 
and planning have already been 
done— and by men who are a lot 
smarter than you’ll ever be. Get it 
straight, Keal. You’re nothing but a 
machine. Act like one!” 



TRIGGERMAN

K EAL stared down at the chess- 
board. The game was almost fin- 
ished. Each of them was left with a 
few major pieces. Most of the pawns 
were off the board. 

“Your move,” the creature said. 
Keal studied the squares. The lay- 
out was perfect. It was all in his 
favor. Although there was one move 
that would trap him completely, 
another would quickly give him the 
game. All he had to do was move his 
white queen in front of the other’s 
bishop and he would have to win. He 
reached for it. 

But he hesitated. 

This is the one that should be 
moved, he told himself. It’s very 
obvious. Or so it seems. What was it 
Anderson said? You ’re nothing but a 
machine. Act like one! If he were 
really playing under his opponent’s 
influence . 

Keal struggled to clear his head. If 
the creature were playing both ends, 
then he was simply following its will. 
In that case the right move became 
the wrong move. No matter how it 
looked and against all reason— some- 
how the wrong move became the 
right move. 

His fingers were damp. He forced 
them away from the queen and 
swung his hand over to the left 
corner where the rook was protecting 
his king. His ears were pounding, his 
neck veins throbbing. It’s the wrong 
move, something in him insisted re- 
peatedly. The other one, the other 
one . But he kept his hand where 
it was and with tremendous effort- 
leaving the white king defenseless— he 



pushed the rook all the way across 
the board. 

He sat back. It was all very clear 
now. It wasn’t his king that was 
trapped. The white army had crushed 
the black. Checkmate. He’d won. 
He’d actually won. 

“You did that very well,” the 
creature said. “There’s no use playing 
another game. I’m afraid you would 
win every time.” 

“I don’t care,” Keal said. 

“You’d win every time every time 
every time ...” 



F rom the distance of a few feet 
Anderson had turned to look 
back at him. The trigger was about 
twenty steps farther. Keal knew he 
should go blindly to the job, rather 
than wonder about the hole in the 
post-hypnosis. Probably it was an 
accident of some sort— some unfore- 
seen quirk of his own mind had 
refused to yield. But he considered 
something else. In a way Anderson 
was right. All the arrangements had 
been made by the best men in the 
country. Perhaps they were better 
and smarter than anyone realized. 
Perhaps they had purposely left one 
man some ability to think for him- 
self— or set up the challenge of a 
strange orange planet— just in case 
the situation added up to zero. 

Well, maybe they had. 

And maybe they hadn’t. 

Either way it ended here— in a 
mountain of nuclear buckshot. Part 
two of the war, Keal reflected grim- 
ly. But what kind of war is it where 



d4 



GALAXY 




everybody loses, where nothing is 
left but charred flesh and boiling 
flood, where the Earth becomes 
desolate and useless and gone to 
limbo? Wliat kind of war is that? 

He started to raise the rifle. 

“We’re not going to do it,” he 
said. “Half the world is still alive.” 

Anderson’s eyes were flat and 
frozen. “We’re making sure it comes 
out even. We’re giving it to the 
bastards who gave it to us.” He was 
walking toward the far wall. “All 
right, if you’re scared— I’ll do it 
myself.” 

Keal lifted the rifle higher, moving 
it to follow Anderson across the 
cave. 

He yelled, “Stay away from 
there!” 

Anderson didn’t look back. “You 



can’t threaten a dead man,” he said 
and he ran for the trigger. 

Keal fired. 

The shot hit Anderson in the 
lower part of the back, dropping him 
to his knees. White-faced, he crawled 
forward, the blood trailing behind 
him, the trigger in front of him. Keal 
shot him again— once, twice, three 
times more— until Anderson fell flat 
in the dirt, his fingers still groping. 

Keal locked the steel door behind 
him and returned to the dismal day- 
light at the mouth of the cave. There 
were other men still coming, he 
thought. Four other triggermen, with 
Anderson’s determination, coming to 
seek the height of glory. Well, no 
one, no one . 

He sat and reloaded the rifle and 
waited. ^

S TAR TREK was— and is— a phe- 
nomenon in television, launched 
in 1966 at the old Desilu studios, 
attaining immediate and growing 
popularity, achieving a third sea- 
son-after the network’s firm deci- 
sion to cancel it— because of the 
near-hysterical pressure of its fans, 
and then going into syndication, 
where it has proved so successful that 
the remns can be seen or will shortly 
be seen all over the country. At one 
time recently in New York it was 
possible (for viewers properly placed) 
to see Star Trek four times a day, 
and there were adherents who did. 
The show evoked a periphery of fans, 
fan clubs, literature and conventions 
which continue to grow and flourish, 
recently melding with wider-interest 
science fiction conventions like last 
spring’s Equicon in Los Angeles at 
which the attendance approached ten 
thousand and (mirabile dictu) the 
banquet was sold out. 



Born with Star Trek was the writ- 
ing career of David Gerrold, whose 
very first sale anywhere was a Star 
Trek script called (finally) The 
Trouble with Tribbles, and who has 
in the short time ensuing run up a 
formidable bibliography which in- 
cludes the Nebula-nominated When 
Harlie Was One. Personable, ap- 
parently relaxed, rather inexcusably 
young, he writes 120 words per 
minute and does it for four hours a 
day, every day. He apparently spends 
the rest of the time watching the 
angles, and he hits them all. At the 
Equicon, though he had no official 
status in the convention machinery, 
he was everywhere— on panels, chat- 
ting, autographing, MC-ing, partici- 
pating in every conceivable way. 
Whenever things ran late and the 
wall-to-wall fans began to grow res- 
tive Gerrold was there, joking, lubri- 
cating, patching, persuading, filling 
in. In the sales room he had a table 



86 



GALAXY 




of his own stocked with his various 
published collections, anthologies 
and novels and a large cage full of 
tribbles— balls of soft fur which he 
makes himself— and sales were brisk. 
He’s a go-bird, a kind of Harlan 
Ellison without the abrasion. All of 
which would be insufficient were he 
not, in addition, a bright and articu- 
late writer with an engaging style in 
his nonfictional work and a fine wide 
spectrum in his fiction; he is one of 
the very few writers around who 
recognizes the value of shifting style 
and pace and approach in his work— a 
knack unrecognized or impossible to 
the great many better-established 
writers he is destined to surpass. 

Typical of his comprehension of 
the angles; he had ready for the 
Equicon two new books The World 
of Star Trek and The Trouble with 
Tribbles, both from Ballantine, each 
$1.50. The former supplements and 
expands on the Roddenberry-Whit- 
field The Making of Star Trek (Bal- 
lantine, 1968) and is especially rich 
in personal anecdote, giving a fine 
view-in-depth of the show with an 
unusual cognizance of the fact that 
people made it, that it was successful 
because it was about people and 
because people— not just faceless 
“viewers”- responded to it. For me 
the book was full of nostalgia; Star 
Trek, especially in its first and sec- 
ond years, had an esprit I have never 
again seen on any Hollywood lot. 



The Trouble with Tribbles is Ger- 
rold’s account of the nascence and 
development of a single script— and a 
scripter— and is required reading not 
only for sf and Star Trefc addicts, but 
for anyone interested in writing any- 
thing for television. The two books 
are an engaging addition to your 
basic library— and Gerrold, to the sf 
firmament. 

AND speaking of engaging reading, 
/V don’t miss R. A. Lafferty’s 
Strange Doings (DAW, 95 <) or Larry 
Eisenberg’s The Best Laid Schemes 
(Collier, $1.25). Both reprints of 
recent hardcovers, both short-story 
collections, they have this in com- 
mon: outrageous imagination, rip- 
pling humor and a profligate use of 
the unexpected. I have written be- 
fore that one day the categorizers 
will get around to describing fiction 
as westerns, whodunits, howdunits, 
fantasy, science fiction, lafferties— 
otherwise the output of this zany, 
magic, musical, philosophical nut can 
never be captured in any corral. I 
love the way Lafferty sips, nibbles, 
chews on language— oh, he loves the 
feel of it on his tongue, and if you 
want a special joy, read any of him 
aloud to people who love words. 
Eisenberg, too, has a special kind of 
humor, a balloon-popping irrever- 
ence. Many of his stories attack 
academic and scientific smugness.

but in the course of them he also 
throws away deadpan lines which 
knock props out from under many 
an icon. For example, in a wild story 
about the disappearance of millions 
of people from the borough of Man- 
hattan, he mentions offhandedly a 
startling rise in pupils’ reading scores, 
due to the disappearance of so many 
teachers. Eisenberg’s^ prose is 
peppered, salted and spiced with this 
kind of thing. Read him with joy. 

A HARDY perennial is Gordon R. 

Dickson, whose new collection 
The Star Road (Doubleday $5.95) is 
most welcome. It consists of nine 
fine stories, all but one previously 
unanthologized, from various sources 
and a good many years, the earliest 
being 1952, the most recently, 1969. 
The book is a good way to ac- 
quaint— or reacquaint— yourself with 
one of the better, soUd, reliable 
storytellers around. I especially liked 
On Messenger Mountain, in which 
the author builds up a thrumming 
tension that left me limp at the end. 

AS FAR as I know The Year of the 
l\.Rats (Walker, $6.95) is Bar- 
bara Guignob Ricci’s first novel and I 
do hope it won’t be her last. She 
writes a supple, articulate prose and 
the thing she writes about is indeed a 
simple one— compassion. To say what 
she has to say she uses a frightening 
overpopulated scene in which the 



guarded central “city” can only sur- 
vive by mass-murder of the billions 
outside, but that’s not what the book 
is about— it’s about compassion. This 
is one of the times I genuinely regret 
I don’t have the space to go into 
more detail; but try to get this 
one— and the ones she’ll write after 
it.

EDITOR'S PAGE 



Re: October, 1973 

Everybody with a future has 
gotten off the Earth in Michael Kur- 
land’s fine new novelette (Think 
Only This of Me) in Galaxy’s forth- 
coming Thank-You-AU October ’73 
issue. No holocaust has struck. Earth 
is well and verdant, nicely populated 
and richly clothed in memories. Its 
contented, cared-for and genetically 
engineered humans live endlessly in 
the great millennia of man’s past- 
each separately created for them— 
forever finding fire, inventing the 
wheel, the automobile, the airplane, 
the jet, smashing the first atom, 
making the first space flight, tire- 
lessly reliving man’s dream of reach- 
ing the stars. 

The off-Earth humans, though, 
have reached the stars and won them. 
Those men and women are what the 
story is about, and it’s a beauty. So 
buy, borrow or steal the October ’73 
Galaxy. And read it. 

It is barely possible that I, too, am 
a little off the Earth at this moment. 
October ’73 mileposts more than 
Galaxy’s return to monthly publica- 
tion— it celebrates the return of a 
vagabond month to your calendar 
and mine. While we have had 
stretches of monthly pubhcation on 
occasion, we have not had an issue of 
Galaxy dedicated solely to October 
since 1969. 

But what, then, is to come in the 
memorable October Galaxy? I asked 
the company president and the 



many friends of yours and mine who 
author the field and the answer 
shapes up— solid. 

More than 20% additional word- 
age, the result of a new and tighter 
type face, will make it possible for us 
to launch a momentous new novel, 
James White’s The Dream Millen- 
nium (our traditional first publica- 
tion anywhere) coincidentally with 
the concluding installment of Arthur 
C. Clarke’s historic, two-part Rendez- 
vous With Rama. 

October ’73 is also Ursula Le 
Guin, 1972 National Book Award 
winner, pondering the gain— or loss— 
if man had to trade his humanity for 
the Ultimate Answer to his quest for 
knowledge. That’s the stuff of her 
latest novelette. Field of Vision. 

And October ’73 is Ray Bradbury 
meditating— in Ode To Electric 
Ben— on the 221st Anniversary of 
Benjamin Franklin’s first announce- 
ment— in the October 19, 1752 issue 
of his Gazette— oi his lightning- 
taming electric-kite experiment, re- 
ordering his world and ours. 

October ’73, of course, is Theo- 
dore Sturgeon’s new and longer 
Bookshelf, plus a spariding new 
Sturgeon story, Agnes, Accent and 
Access, featuring Merrihew, the 
troubleshooter. And more. The 
month is stiU open. 

But while we are name-dropping, 
let me add two more. In the issue of 
Galaxy you are now reading you will 
find Michael Hatt’s Circle of Flies, 
which is not only his first published 
story but the first he submitted 
anywhere. And Lou Fisher’s Trigger- 
man . Let me know what you think,

QUICKENING 

Man thought himself alone till 
CosCros scratched the Earth 
creature— and found an alien! 



W. MAC FAR LANE 



I 

T hey left CosCros a barrel of 
water and a knife with a short, 
rounded blade for prying shellfish off 
the rocks and opening bivalves. It 
was an island small as a roof and tail 
as a house, with no shelter, no 
vegetation and no fresh water. After 
the second sixday alone he began 
whetting the knife on a fine-grained 
rock. After a sambat he was talking 
to it as his only friend. 

His friend helped him kill a small 
octivort in the crystal ocean, but in a 
spell of dead calm weather— when he 
had stopped eating and speaking and 
the water in the barrel was hand-deep 
and green with algae— his friend drew 
a thin red line across his wrist and he 
threw the knife tumbling into the 



90 





sea. It stuttered sunset remonstra- 
tions back at him. He lay face down 
on the rock. He was done with 
friends. 

That night a squall dumped two 
fingers of rain on the island. It 
overflowed the shallow catchbasins 
CosCros had cleaned of sand and 
seawrack. It washed the salt grime 
from his body. It washed away the 
last of his hope for justice. He had 
been accused, betrayed and con- 
demned by the Question Framers. 
The electorate had voted 92.6 per 
cent in favor of his death, but the 
answer had been implicit in the 
question: Should the traitor CosCros 
die? The men who framed the ques- 
tions ruled the world. There was no 
recourse in direct democracy. He had 
been put on the island and his 
execution out to bid. 

Eight years had passed since the 
last time the vote had gone over 
90 percent— when AlaGran, the 
pirate, had abrogated the will of 
others and the skene of Jannali had 
beggared itself with an unexampled 
high bid. The Jannali had enlarged 
their amphitheater and put AlaGran 
arena with an octivort. He had killed 
and eaten three before the fourth 
octivort had eaten him. He had lasted 
three sixdays and the ticket sales 
alone had covered the bid price. The 
food concessions, the entertainment 
licenses, the lodgings and mementos 
had made the Jannali affluent. It had 
been a worthy end for a pirate. 

But for a man who wanted to save 
the world? 



CosCros lay on his belly and drank 
the sweet water. Whoever threatened 
the instant expression of public de- 
sire should anticipate a skene with a 
population of one. The man who 
holds a mirror to the incoherent 
beast with many heads should realize 
he will be condemned to single sover- 
eignty, left to institute his own re- 
forms and plan for a future as 
nebulous as ... as that smoke on the 
horizon. 

It was not the excursion boat he 
expected with a cage on deck. It was 
an Implementation ship under forced 
draft, the smoke streaming away in 
the wind, the bow waves thrown high 
and the wake rolling cream-green 
behind. It approached smartly. The 
boom was rigged. The ship stood off 
the sheer north face of the island. 
The net swung out, CosCros timed 
the surge and was swept up like a 
child in a swing. The ship was under- 
way before he had been lowered to 
the deck. A sailor steadied him 
against the pitch and roll. The deck 
shook under the thrust of the screw. 
He was led below to the central 
cabin. 



G RISONGIR was sitting at his 
ease. He was a big man with a 
high forehead and heavy jaw, tum- 
bled brown curls, a voice smooth as a 
barrel of oil. He waved negligently 
to a chair and dismissed the guard. 
CosCros had trusted him. He trusted 
him now to serve his own interests. 
“Due to an unforseen circum- 



QUICKENING 



91 




stance, CosCros, the bid award is 
delayed. I hear that Jannali are think- 
ing in terms of an irax an hour to be 
released in a caged arena— the prison- 
er to be awarded an hour and twelve 
minutes before the next. Then an 
hour and twenty-four, an hour and 
thirty -six and so on. Mad vicious 
little beasts. And Moorine are said to 
have some notion of a glass oven. 
The prisoner would be fed on the 
fungus that kills when half-cooked.” 
His voice grew contemplative. “The 
weight of a man in the oven is 
required to activate the heat.” 

CosCros felt a stinging sensation 
high in his nose. The chair felt 
infinitely luxurious after bare rocks. 
He was secure from the empty bowl 
of the sky in the cabin. The melli- 
fluent voice was balm after the mind- 
less mutter of the waves. His hatred 
was not diminished, but what a 
wondrous thing was man! 

GrisOngir spoke with more em- 
phasis. “There are the usual varia- 
tions of the shooting gallery, but the 
Tintenbar are reported to have a 
really ingenious notion. They pro- 
pose a tracked maze down the side of 
the amphitheater and the prisoner 
flat on a cart, his head projecting 
over the front. Down he goes at 
random— they say— along the path- 
ways. They contemplate many reso- 
lutions to the pattern: food, a beast 
to fight, a maiden to bed and per- 
haps— entirely at random— a very 
solid post.” 

CosCros marveled at the ingenuity. 

“Once a day, down you go 



through the maze. It is a most 
expensive idea and has aroused great 
interest, but bids were sure to run 
high for the denigrator of democ- 
racy, the arch-deviationist, the un- 
ashamed elitist. That’s you, Cos- 
Cros.” 

“Why is the bid award delayed?” 

“To the heart of the matter!” said 
GrisOngir admiringly. “It is simple 
enough. We have found a use for a 
devious, suspicious mind. Your ob- 
servation is acute, no matter how 
flagrantly impolitic. Consensus de- 
mocracy will not tolerate a challenge 
to the rule of law.” 

CosCros was silent. 

He had given GrisOngir his al- 
legiance to elect him Question Fram- 
er from Yelavon. Had hope been 
betrayed the day GrisOngir had said 
he would implement their hopes for 
the future and climbed aboard the 
steamcar for Crux? No hope be- 
trayed. GrisOngir had been true to 
himself. 

“For the proposed service we will 
grant you null status— no mandatory 
ballot and optional voting rights.” 

“A handsome offer.” CosCros rub- 
bed a finger on the smooth edge of 
the table. “When do you want me to 
stop the sun? Or bag the wind? Tell 
me, at which end of the hairy vorti- 
cor do I stand— the teeth or the 
flatulence?” 

GrisOngir ignored the childish vul- 
garity. 

“A ship from the stars has landed 
at Crux. The aliens are men. They 
call their home Earth. Their planet 



92 



GALAXY 




circles a sun similar to our own. How 
far? The answer is in terms of the 
distance light travels in a measured 
period of time. The terms are mean- 
ingless. Give them a droos to wear 
instead of their peculiar garments, 
put a cup of beer in their hands and 
you could not tell them from Ahw- 
Rahn, the common man.” 

CosCros stared at him. “Why?” 
“Of course. Why have they come 
and what do they want? It may be as 
simple as why we travel the skenes. 
Why do we build bridges between 
them? Why run steamcars around the 
two rings? Why do we sail the endless 
ocean to the ice, searching for islands 
that exist only in fanciful tales? 
Because they are there— even when 
they are not!” 

Suit your style to your idealistic 
audience, thought CosCros, and so 
encourage this image of a metaphysi- 
cal cloudhead. “Have they seen God 
in their travels? Do they have gods?” 
“As many as we. In the service of 
their gods, will they enslave our 
people and take our treasures? The 
answer is one of many we must 
find.” 

CosCros held the table light with 
both hands. He was a leaf in a torrent 
of information, spun by the smell of 
food from the galley, the motion of 
the ship, the colors and shapes and 
sizes of human constructions as op- 
posed to bare rock and sea and sky. 
“What is my function?” 

GrisOngir rubbed his face to an 
expression of candid honesty. “If I 
remember the judgment— you are an 



ethical imperialist, a truth-bender, a 
contamination to the young and an 
advocate of slave work morality.” He 
smiled without humor. “We need 
such a person to understand the 
aliens. If you refuse—” 

“This is my world.” The obvious. 
“You made me Question Finder in 
Yelavbon.” Flattery. “It is better to 
be a live skink than a dead octivort.” 
Meeching self-interest. 

“Agreed. You are true to your 
skewed reality. Fortunately for you, 
it now coincides with my own.” He 
said benevolently, “You look like 
Ahwjlahn after a sixday drunk. Go 
through that door. They’ll take care 
of you.” 

C OSCROS luxuriated in a scrub-oil 
bath, was dressed in a rich orange 
bias and darker droos and enjoyed 
the skills of a barber who clucked his 
tongue over the neglect of man’s 
crowning glory and shaved his beard 
and curled his hair in a style he had 
never worn before. He was served a 
simple meal. He sipped a glass of 
distilled beer and enjoyed the voli- 
tion-free state of travel so praised by 
the poets. He did not believe a word 
of the promises made him. 

In the timeless zone of travel 
personal danger was as hypothetical 
as the monsters from space in his 
future or the rock in his past. What 
he thought about was the stranger in 
the barber’s mirror, burned brown 
and gaunt by the sun and made wary 
by solitary confinement. There was 
an unfamiliar set to the jaw. The 



QUICKENING 



93 




dark-gold eyes smoldered. Who he 
was and what changes had occurred 
would be determined by his reaction 
to the high probability that when his 
usefulness was over he would again 
face betrayal and death. 

The ship steamed discreetly into 
the bay at Crux the next afternoon. 
The fishing boats, the sea-plant 
scows, the ferries, the green-garden 
rafts up the river and the swarms of 
houseboats were the same as ever. So 
was the pall of smoke, the harbor 
garbage and the stink of the brown 
river. 

The men on the streets wore 
checkered I-have-voted patches. The 
crew had the old red-and-white 
stripes with the barred exemption for 
sailors. CosCros wore a temporary 
null with the white cross on black. 
He read the ballot outside the poll 
while GrisOngir and the crew voted 
and got their checkered patches. 
Mother and skene questions; Should 
cargo boats charge one freight for 
Damanami skeul wood? Obviously, 
yes. Should the beer allotment be 
decreased? Obviously, no. Should 
land returning to skene control from 
entrepreneurs carry an increased 
minimum bid price? Yes, otherwise 
where would the money come from? 

All misapprehension to the people, 
CosCros said to himself without emo- 
tion. 

He turned and looked up at the 
ruined fortifications of the CruxCos 
kings in the days before democracy. 
The spaceship had landed in the great 
courtyard. He could not see it from 



below. He wondered if the represen- 
tative democracy he advocated could 
be essentially another form of tyran- 
ny. There lay the problem: one 
man’s benevolent despotism is an- 
other man’s half-cooked fungus. 

A labor master trooped by with 
his boys and girls, for once a good- 
looking crew, alert and well fed. A 
senior mendicant with a dwarf came 
whining to CosCros, caught sight of 
his face and sidled away. A bompan 
man blew the ash from his coals and 
offered to cook whatever was 
brought him. A dye merchant carried 
cerise cloth on his arm. A milk 
woman with a baby on her hip bared 
a breast and squirted the eye of a 
wizened stall-keeper who screeched 
at her to move on. 

CosCros shortened his stride to 
walk with GrisOngir through the 
open market to the base of the cliff. 
The swarms of men and women 
getting and spending, children under- 
foot, begging and eating, haggling 
and drinking, did not affect him as 
once they had. Was devotion to the 
public weal a sickness from which he 
had been cured by isolation? 

T he elevator driver spun the 
wheel when the car was loaded. 
Water gushed from the tank into the 
channel until the lift rose freely, 
drawn up by the weight of the 
descending car. GrisOngir and Cos 
Cros disembarked on a tableland 
striped with crops and salted with 
houses that overflowed the city on 
the alluvial plain. The artesian bore

and tank serving the elevator had 
once stood inside the castle wall, 
now many years gone, but the inner 
stonework remained as testiihony to 
the oppressive past. They walked 
through the zigzag entry into the 
paved courtyard. 

The starship was a flattened sphere 
six men tall and ten wide at the belt 
line. It loomed over the myriads in 
the court milling around the base of 
the ship, reading the graffiti scrawled 
as high as a man could reach. A 
group of drummers lounged in the 
shade of a wall. A teacher huddled 
with a class of pre -voters. Lackadaisi- 
cal women from one of the farms 
hawked minced fruit in halfshells. 
Four steamcar men were feeding two 
happy girls in country hats. 

A bright yellow ramp extended 
from a rectangular opening. A guard 
was ignoring a woman who insisted 
the ship be moved because her cory- 
bantic band was hired into the court 
a sixday from now. The lead treble 
drummer was picking up tempo and 
the others patterned around his beat. 
CosCros found his heart following 
the treble up a beat, then faster in an 
insistent progression. 

GrisOngir stopped. He unhooded 
his octivort eyes, flat gray and ruth- 
less. “Give no refusal. None at all.” 

CosCros followed him up the 
ramp. The ship had been built under 
a far sun and not of wood, stone or 
metal. The boilers had to be fantastic 
to move it through the thin empy- 
rean along an invisible track, by 
intangible cogwheels. He abandoned 



all attempts to understand in the 
entryport. He saw a deep room il- 
luminated by forced flame sliced thin 
and fixed cold in the ceiling. The 
cupboard doors on either side were 
filled with— wings for flying? Gold 
wire in coils? Filled with exotic food 
cured by symp so sweet a spoonful 
fed a man for a day? 

A tiny figure moved in the wall. It 
opened its mouth and gibberish came 
out: “Is this our guineapig?’ 

Were there hordes of hand-high 
aliens, fanged and irax-vicious, hidden 
in the cupboards? 

T he inner wall split and each door 
slid away. The room beyond was 
large and circular. The floor was 
covered with rugs over a resilient 
carpet and the man whose miniature 
had been in the wall was sitting in a 
chair, turned to the entry. 

“Welcome aboard. Oh, the writing 
instrument of my mother’s sister! 
How's that?” His legs were individ- 
ually encased in cloth. He wore a 
short red bias and another over it, of 
black and white checks. He said, “My 
name is PeTersNel,” and his face 
became fixed forever in CosCros’ 
mind. 

Question Framers sat in a double 
arc of spindly chairs against the 
curved waU. The ghost of a shimmer 
hung across the room between the 
men and the three aliens. Pedantic 
young DasiKan tapped a slate with a 
wand for attention. “A writing in- 
strument,” said DasiKan, “is a tool 
for writing—” 



QUICKENING 



95 




CosCros sat down and gripped the 
chair seat. The room was thick with 
inexplicable devices. The common- 
place was not what it seemed. Behind 
the starmen were windows, but each 
showed a different direction. The 
worst was the window looking down 
at the spaceship, the courtyard, the 
cliffs and the tiny, moving, fore- 
shortened people from high in the 
air, all fixed on a vertical— yes— a 
vertigo wall. 

PeTersNel had gray eyes and high 
cheeks and straw-yellow hair. His 
face was melancholy and mocking. It 
was also vital and innocent. He was 
clean shaven. He turned his head and 
CosCros saw a burr of gold on his 
cheeks. He was older than CosCros. 
He was younger. CosCros groaned 
silently. The smile on those lips 
could mean he was figuring ways to 
butcher plump young DasiKan, who 
was tediously explaining familial rela- 
tionships with drawings on the alien 
board that held lines inside the glass 
surface. 

The slender starman with the dark 
brown hair had sleepy eyes bright as 
coals in a cave. He wore lazy arro- 
gance like a droos and calmness like a 
bias. He was a sheathed sword in 
qiiiet and bloody potential. 

The third man sat in a condition 
Qf arrested momentum, like an enor- 
mous stone in the middle of the air. 
He was bigger and broader than the 
other two, relaxed and inevitable as 
the fall of night. His face was ruddy, 
his hair white, his expression placid. 
Was he thinking of recipes? CosCros 



put the question to himself harshly, 
in a futile hope of diminishing the 
impact, the fascination of this con- 
tradictory trio. 

PeTersNel cut short mother’s sis- 
ter’s married relationships. He said 
they would see a recording of Earth 
to complete the day’s work. The 
windows faded to a single large pic- 
ture of an unsupported ball, mottled 
white and blue and brown. The ball 
expanded until it was Earth with a 
harbor, with ships of sea and air and 
land. The buildings were gigantic, but 
Earthmen also had trees and green 
grass. They had enormous oval am- 
phitheaters. They tamed weird mon- 
sters. They farmed to the horizons. 
They held back rivers. Their casual 
mastery of the world, the bewilder- 
ing scope and variety of their activi- 
ties was presented against a back- 
ground of alien music more insistent 
than drums. When it was over Cos- 
Cros slumped in his chair, bludgeon- 
ed by the intensity of his attention, 
stunned into a lassitude of shock. 

The slender alien was speaking. He 
said the danger of contact was real, 
and this was why they maintained 
the force barrier, the invisible divi- 
sion between themselves and the men 
of this world. 

GrisOngir replied the Framers 
understood disease and would not 
hold the aliens responsible if the 
volunteer died. They hoped he would 
not prove infectious. In fact, he had 
been living in isolation since the 
landing for this very reason. 

All eyes turned to CosCros.

H e stood up. He kept a properly 
sober face. It was lunatic comedy 
that GrisOngir should smile as his 
new treachery was accepted. This 
was throwing an octivort into the 
ocean to drown. There was nothing 
CosCros wanted as much as to stay 
with the Earthmen. 

The Question Framers filed out of 
the spaceship. The inner entryport 
doors closed. The shimmering barrier 
snapped and was gone. 

PeTersNel stretched and said, 
“Nice to have you aboard. You 
understand that time is needed for all 
things, from seed to flower, from 
stranger to friend, from alien menace 
to a comity of understanding with- 
out alienation.” 

“Why do you take lessons,” asked 
CosCros slowly, “when you are 
fluent in our tongue?” 

“It’s a trick,” said the slender 
man. He yawned. “It’s also common 
sense to give you weight, to balance 
your special knowledge against our 
own.” He was not sleepy. “I’m 
WilDysE.” 

The broad-shouldered man with 
the white hair sighed. “We over- 
whelm. There is no way our landing 
will not be a shock. We try to restore 
confidence by being less than omni- 
potent. My name is BranDer, ChaRlz- 
BranDer.” 

“I am overwhelmed,” said Cos- 
Cros. He sat down abruptly. He knew 
no ritual for social conduct with 
starmen. He would have to be him- 



self— whatever he had become. They 
waited. He said, “I have a feeling you 
have done this before.’ 

“Do you know?’ asked WilDysE. 

BranDer blinked. 

PeTersNel swung a chair around 
and straddled it. “You are the first 
man to make this observation on all 
the planets we have visited,” he said 
pleasantly. 

“Why?” asked CosCros. 

BranDer said, “Why visit other 
planets? A good question. Perhaps to 
socialize. To be neighborly. To visit 
relatives and— through meeting 
them— to understand ourselves a little 
better.” 

“Greed,” said WilDysE, “Simple 
honest need To strive, to seek, to 
find and not to yield.’ Who wants to 
be an Idle King? Tennyson was a 
great poet in spite of himself,” 

“Maybe we’re looking for God,” 
said PeTersNel, 

“We don’t like to be God,” said 
BranDer. 

“Having tried it,” said WilDysE. 

PeTersNel said, “When we were 
Earthbound we could anticipate mar- 
vels. Intelligent arachnids or reptiles, 
star kings and galactic empires, talk- 
ing plants and talking planets. Oh, we 
had the gaudiest kind of dreams— 
alas, lost innocence! What we have 
found circling the far stars is man— 
and only man. We don’t know why. 
And last and worst, we are the 
advanced race.” 

“A deadly disappointment,’ said 
BranDer. 

‘This is why we keep searching,”

said PeTersNel. “We are looking for 
someone else to blame, to give us 
revelation, to take responsibility.” 

“My name is CosCros.” He was 
deeply moved. “I am pleased beyond 
saying to be with you.” It was 
ridiculous to think that truth was 
freedom, but anything less than the 
available truth became incentive. to 
it. He did not entirely believe the 
Earthmen, but whatever they wanted 
here their preoccupations were of the 
same order as his own. 

“Then let’s eat dinner,” said 
WilDysE. “Come on CosCros. Kit- 
chen and bedrooms are upstairs. All 
the machinery is downstairs— this is 
where we work. Let’s go, PeTer- 
Damlt— philosophy is tolerable only 
with a fuU belly.” 

CosCros followed through a door 
and up perfectly ordinary stairs. If 
the strangers had consciously set him 
at ease, what else should they do? If 
they were more or less than they 
seemed, what man is not? He could 
deal with them. He walked into the 
upstairs room with modest confi- 
dence. 

It was filled with women. 



P ETERSNEL introduced MariAn 
and Jen and CaMila and Fay and 
BarBarA. They wore brighter 
colors than the men and far less 
clothing. Women had appeared in the 
picture of Earth, but they had been 
no more real to CosCros than the 
ships of air or the incredible build- 
ings. If women existed in fact, then 



Earth must exist in reality. He stood 
bemused. 

BranDer saw his difficulty and 
took him to an ablutions room. He 
explained the mechanisms, challeng- 
ed CosCros to wash his hands and 
patiently explained again. 

The meal was bright red lips, bold 
eyes and sUky hair and the confused 
realization that women were peers 
among Earthmen. They dressed— or 
were undressed — shamelessly— or 
shamefully— and exposed their navels 
without qualm. They calmly exposed 
six bare toes on each bare foot. They 
spoke to him freely and they were 
kind to him. Their kindest act was 
pouring half a tumblerful of whiskey 
and putting him to bed in one of the 
bed closets around the room. “He is 
emotionally exhausted, " said Bran- 
Der. “Sleep well, CosCros. You have 
journeyed to Earth today and that’s 
enough to tire any man.” 

The next sixdays were forever 
jumbled. CosCros thought it was 
because he could not distinguish rela- 
tive values and aU the things he 
learned were of indeterminable con- 
sequence. He did not forget the real 
world. His belief that death awaited 
him settled his mind and concentrat- 
ed his attention. The Earthmen gave 
him the English language in direct 
imprints under a helmet. His under- 
standing surprised them. 

“On some other worlds,” said 
sturdy MariAn, “the cultural lock 
made learning impossible.” 

“How could you learn my tongue 
so fast?” he asked. 



98 



GALAXY 




Plain Jen said, “Computer analysis 
and rationalization. Plus a long his- 
tory of trying to be culture-free, 
which is impossible.” 

“And the quick imprint,” said 
Fay, plump and smiling. “We also try 
to understand the common denomi- 
nators.” 

CaMila said, “All men eat, drink 
and snore.” 

“It beguiles the observant mind,” 
said languid Bar Bar A, “that on every 
world the old trinity mles or death 
results: identity, variety and se- 
curity.” 

CosCros shook his head. “I will 
never understand.” 

They protested, but he meant he 
did not expect to be allowed time for 
understanding. He soaked up infor- 
mation like a child. He was diown 
the drive engines where a small sun 
was entrapped, he saw the microfiche 
files and the retriever, which supplied 
data on a molecular level to the 
manufactuary. To please him, Bran- 
Der programed a writing instrument 
and it was spun— it took place— it 
happened together— it was made be- 
fore his eyes. It was a light-negation 
pen that unreflected light 
on any surface. The gadgetry was 
only technological wonder— it was 
the friendship and trust, the courtesy 
and thoughtfulness the Earthmen 
showed to him and to each other 
that amazed CosCros. They had no 
meanness of spirit. They quarreled 
and laughed and argued together in 
amity. He found this sadly sus- 
picious. 



The language lessons progressed in 
the room below. The Question Fram- 
ers slowly came to regard the Earth- 
men as lucky relatives who had 
struck it rich. It seemed possible, 
then reasonable, then only right that 
they should share the wealth. Cos- 
Cros watched the screens in the room 
above. At first he was shamed by the 
Framers’ transparent interest in 
changing lead to gold, but when he 
saw the oblique encouragement the 
Earthmen offered he forgot apolo- 
gies. 

The Framers were especially 
charmed by a magic fluid that occurs 
when certain particular requirements 
are met, to provide illumination or 
heating or turning wheels or saying 
yes-no, yes-no a million times in the 
time it takes a man to breathe— and 
thereby solving any problem. If elec- 
tricity were man’s right and heritage, 
then they should be given it. As they 
learned more of Earth the Framers 
grew eloquent in favor of advanced 
weaponry, aircars, medicine, moun- 
tains of food and immortality. 

CosCros listened with growing dis- 
quiet. 

PeTersNel said that Earthmen had 
learned these things— but not immor- 
tality-through a sharp discipline 
called science, a system of looking at 
the world so cutting that most men 
took the benefits and deplored the 
method. 

WilDysE said science was a faith, 
just as mathematics was a hypothesis 
that three plus three equals six. 

BranDer said it was obvious they 



QUICKENING 



99 




had landed on a paradisaical planet. 
The two long loops of islands in the 
green sea joined by the steamcar 
bridges were unique and delightful. 
He thought this world should follow 
its own course and refuse any gift. 

The Framers became importunate. 

PeTersNel was persuaded to admit 
the Earthmen had made gifts in the 
past. “But it was always a universal 
gift. It must go to every man, woman 
and child on the world, for the 
common good. This is impossible.” 

Not so, shouted the Framers. It 
was the obligation of every man to 
vote every sixday. This was the thou- 
sand-year-old method of direct dem- 
ocracy, made possible for the 
entire world by the steamcars. Cer- 
tainly every individual could receive 
a gift. What was it? 

‘The common good has not yet 
been determined,” said PeTersNel 
and he would say no more. 

are you so silent?” 
T T asked CaMila. 

“I was wondering what you can 
give,” said CosCros, “that will not 
accrete to a smart and greedy man in 
a sambat.” 

“Moonlight,” she said promptly. 
“A world called Cor Carol! Three- 
eight was in so sluggish a time refer- 
ent, we gave it a moon.” She was 
lithe and brown and supple. The idea 
of her reaching out through a win- 
dow and pushing a moon around a 
world . was not funny after all. 

“Why give anything?” 

“So we are not forgotten,” she 



said, but this was the same sort of 
limited answer as moonlight for Cor 
Carol! Three-eight, because moon- 
light is not all that moons give 
worlds. 

CosCros said, “I am proud of our 
achievements, the unification of 
mankind, the growth of equity in 
government along with the engineer- 
ing skill to make it possible. At first 
there were boats, then little walk- 
ways and then stone bridges between 
the near islands. When it was time for 
pile-driving, steamdriven piles linked 
the skenes. The evolution of high- 
speed steamcars, with the knee-high 
wall in the center for directional 
stability and the smooth flanges on 
either side, made the will of the 
people manifest in a sixday. AH this 
occurred in the incredibly short 
space of a thousand years. Who 
knows what the future holds? Do 
you?” 

“Yes,” said CaMila. She had drawn 
a thin line of red just above and 
below her eyelashes. “The demand 
outgrows the resources. The result is 
chaos and retrogression. A new bal- 
ance is struck at a subsistence level of 
achievement.” 

“It’s not an immutable law,” said 
Mari An, “but there is a time impera- 
tive for society, just as the unstimu- 
lated child will not achieve opti- 
mum.” 

“We have no fixed obligation,” 
said Jen. “Do you think we should 
go away and forget your world?” 

“Or do we have some responsi- 
bUity?” asked Fay. 



100 



GALAXY 




“I don’t know,” said CosCros. 

‘Then we must do the best we 
can,” said CaMila. 

CosCros had been sure of many 
things before he was convicted of 
treason, but exposure on the island 
and exposure to the Earthmen had 
shaken his certainties. They were not 
arrogant or self-righteous, but their 
undisclosed intention and their re- 
fusal to consider serious matters with 
due sobriety filled him with mis- 
givings. They were hoodwinking the 
Framers into accepting a gift. What- 
ever it would be, he had the queasy 
feeling it would be for good. A 
morally loaded gift is always suspect. 

It was instant voting. 

P ETERSNEL made the offer. The 
Earthmen would supply 
talking bracelets to all. Then every 
man and woman could push Yes or 
No on the bracelet. Their response 
would be sent by magic to a central 
repository and tallied. 

WilDysE passed out bracelets to 
the Question Framers. “Is the sun 
shining today?” he asked. A box tall 
as a man showed the words oii a 
screen: Yes 52, No 9. PeTersNel 
explained again and the Yes vote rose 
to sixty-one. 

DasiKan protested that there was 
no assurance that everyone would 
vote. BranDer told him to abstain 
and asked, “Are Question Framers 
intelligent?” The Yes vote was sixty, 
the No vote zero and one abstention 
was noted. BranDer tapped the box 



and a number showed on the screen, 
the same as that on DasiKan’s brace- 
let. 

The matter of enfranchising 
women was bitterly opposed. It was 
resolved only when PeTersNel agreed 
the screen should show male and 
female voting. He was adamant in his 
insistence that every woman should 
have a bracelet as well as every man. 

Finally GrisOngir stood beside the 
box and asked, “Should we accept 
the gift of the Earthmen?” 

The vote was unanimously in 
favor. 

GrisOngir said it was evident from 
the disappearance of the force bar- 
rier, that hands-across-the-stars were 
not infectious, and their volunteer 
should be returned. 

CaMila said soberly, “Stay with 
us.” 

WilDysE appeared at the top of 
the stairs. “It is your choice, Cos- 
Cros.” 

“Where does loyalty lie?” He was 
numb with decision. “I must go.” He 
turned blindly and stumbled down 
the stairs. He wanted with his whole 
heart to stay, but he understood the 
peril of the gift. He foresaw the 
destruction of his world. He had no 
illusions about his probable success 
in persuading the Framers to his 
viewpoint but he had no option— he 
had to walk into the dull, mumbling 
jaws of futile endeavor. 

He said goodbye to PeTersNel and 
BranDer and followed GrisOngir 
down the yellow alumina-fibered 
ramp. The afternoon sun washed the 



QUICKENING 



101 




old castle walls to painted scenery. 
He walked with the Question Fram- 
ers through the swarming men and 
women. The crowd stank. 

He reminded himself, as he had so 
often before, that he was obligated 
to people and not disembodied ideas, 
that he must be wary of Humanity 
and Large Issues in order not to 
become a tyrant himself. He had 
made his choice. He wondered if the 
memory of his time in the space^ip 
would ache forever. He wrenched his 
thoughts back to the old problem of 
how gratifying it was to be con- 
cerned with abstractions about man- 
kind and to forget actual men and 
women. 

They went down the elevator and 
through the streets into the central 
district, past the steamcar terminus 
and the Implementation barracks to 
the hollow square where the Ques- 
tion Framers lived. Concordance Hall 
was at one end, along with clerical 
and bureaucratic support offices. 

“I must give you a warning,” said 
CosCros. 

“Come into the anteroom,” said 
GrisOngir. 

“You know my mistrust of direct 
democracy and instant laws—” 

“Which got you condemned to 
death.” 

“I implore your attention! Instant 
voting will be far worse. There will 
be no time cushion, no time for 
modifying thought, no time for—” 

“You want to modify the will of 
the people.” 

“It takes time for all things—” 



“It is time to vote for the purest 
democracy. This meeting will make 
official the vote aboard the ship. We 
will frame the question, ‘Shall we 
accept the beneficent gift of the 
visitors?’ It will be put out for vote 
on the steamcars tomorrow morning. 
No more nonsense from you. Wait 
here. I want your secret report on 
the monsters.” 

“You fool! Instant response means 
destruction!” 

GrisOngir shook off CosCros’ 
hand. His eyes were opaque. “I see it 
is time to reconsider your status.” 



Ill 

H e went out and slammed the 
door behind him. CosCros 
opened it immediately. GrisOngir 
was cutting across the flow of the 
Framers to the Implementary sta- 
tion. CosCros moved with the crowd. 
He glanced back and saw a guard 
take position in front of the door. He 
walked briskly along the outer hall 
and out the back stairs. He had no 
food, no friends and no money, but 
he was his own man for the first time 
in more than three sambats. 

He walked at his own pace toward 
the estuary. Null patches were less 
uncommon there and the brewery 
was famous. He idled along the 
docks, watched the labor crews finish 
work. They piled the last baskets of 
skeul wood and arardup kindling 
onto the carts. The skeul was even 
smaller in diameter than it had 



102 



GALAXY 




been— instant voting would reduce 
the pressure on the supply— Earth- 
men had used petroleum— none was 
available here. Concentrated energy 
was growing short. CaMila had been 
serious— why should the thought dry 
his mouth? 

He entered a tavern displaying the 
brewery logo, a cloud of steam riven 
by a lightning bolt of discovery, and 
tore a beer privilege slip from the 
back of his patch. The proprietor was 
sympathetic when CosCros said he 
had forgotten his purse and slipped 
him a flatbread wrapped around a 
piece of fish for another beer slip. 

He returned to the estuary in the 
gathering dusk, found a watchman 
and had him load a barrel of fish oil 
onto a boat that was broad beam and 
light draft. A single gaff sail was 
rigged without a boom. CosCros told 
the watchman the skipper was drunk- 
er than AhwRahn. The watchman 
said he wished he were, lit the 
lantern on the stern pole and cast off 
the mooring lines. A null badge worn 
with audacity had real advantages. 

CosCros was out of the harbor 
traffic by moons-up, thanks to the 
favoring wind and quiet sea. The 
wherry had a low freeboard and 
belonged on the river or in the 
harbor, but it was loaded with 
bundles of arardup and was a safe 
enough coastal craft. CosCros sailed 
half the night before he saw the 
waves on the causeway to Iloura, a 
straight line of pale breakers. The 
steamcar bridge crossed the deeper 
water on pilings. He tied the wherry 



four boatlengths from the Douran 
shore two hours before sunrise. 

It was not too late to change his 
mind. 

He gripped the tiller until his 
fingers hurt, trying to squeeze under- 
standing from apprehension. Were 
the Earthmen guilty of malicious 
mischief? How could men of good 
will sponsor disaster? Democracy is 
responsibility and AhwRahn will al- 
ways make beer from grain and 
worry about flatbread later. Society 
is based on restraint— without re- 
straint anything is immediately pos- 
sible. Drowning every other person 
would leave more for the others— 
solution unacceptable. He groaned 
and looked at the loom of the land in 
the night. 

I LOURA was a spiny island twice 
as long as Crux was wide, 
a skene with a small population and 
scant resources. The north ring began 
at Iloura, the south at Crux. Here 
was the single bridge north and here 
he could buy the most time. The 
vote could not be quickly ratified 
until the steamcar line was repaired. 
Buy time for what? Second 
thoughts? Rebellion? Who will rebel 
against immediate gain? 

He knocked in the barrelhead and 
poured oil on the arardup. It was still 
not too late. He could change his 
mind. He could return to the space- 
ship. Let the world take care of itself. 
Who was he to read the future and 
find disaster in instant democracy? 
He swung the hobbling stern lantern 



QUICKENING 



103 




inboard. If the Earthmen were dedi- 
cated to longterm good, it was pre- 
sently cold comfort. Maybe he was 
wrong. Maybe he was not. He 
smashed the lantern into the cargo. 

He swam ashore because he had 
been wrong. He should have set the 
fire from the bridge. The arardup 
caught from the flaming oil and 
volatilized into a burgeoning flower 
of fire. He dove into the black water. 
He pulled himself onto the rocks and 
was aghast at the intensity of the 
blaze. The flame gouted high over 
the bridge. He crouched to avoid the 
searing heat. The piers were burning, 
so was the cribbing and so was the 
bolted wooden track. 

He climbed to a cart road and 
loped along the shore. He heard 
voices ahead and hid in the dark 
while men and boys passed him 
toward the glow in the sky. He 
turned downhill to a sheltered bay, 
avoided the houses and found a skiff 
pulled up on the sand. He rowed to 
an anchored fishing boat, sharp at 
both ends, and sailed out of the bay 
on the light wind running ahead of 
dawn. 

The boat had provisions and 
water. He coasted well offshore for 
the day and night and at midmorning 
he saw the hills of Kuttai, the 
first skene of the eastern loop. He 
went ashore at twilight to refill his 
water cask at the foot of a sharp 
ravine. The steamcar trestle crossed 
above. There was a rusty universal 
wrench aboard the boat and he spent 
that night removing bolts from the 



trestle track. He sailed at dawn and 
rounded the tip of Kuttai before 
noon. Bridges marched to the hori- 
zon over a chain of low islands. He 
fished the inner sea until night fell, 
then set out for the western skenes. 

He was becalmed in the morning. 
The sail did not stir for three days. 
He chewed the fish he caught to 
supplement his water. The inner 
ocean was glassy. He fell into a 
condition of somnambulant contem- 
plation— and when the wind stirred 
again, old facts had assumed new 
relationships. 

The spaceship had to be old. The 
main fabric showed signs of age and 
repair, though individual parts were 
new. The folding chairs for the Fram- 
ers were sparkling new. The rugs 
covering the carpet could have been 
made on his own world. The food 
was exotic, but he was sure it was 
not Earth food because the words 
were not in the English language. The 
bed closets were more than individ- 
ually different— the sand-orange of 
BranDer’s, the lines of green on green 
on green of BarBarA’s, WilDysE’s 
aqueous blue-gray. Fay’s overlapping 
white scales. Of course the ship had 
visited on many worlds. How long 
did it take to wear a hollow along the 
alumina-fiber ramp? 

Men and women on Earth had five 
fingers to a hand and everyone else 
had six. Other pictures showed one 
navel per person. They had peculiar 
skin shades— they might go through 
color phases— and the starcrew could 
have been chosen from a single 



104 



GALAXY 




variant race. More women than men? 
Strange worlds surely presented 
strange dangers. English as a common 
tongue? Because of its wealth? Or 
because each crew member spoke a 
different native language? 

The starmen were not Earthmen. 

C OSCROS landed on Derra, re- 
plenished his water and lodged a 
timber across the track in a tunnel. 
He stole food from an Implementa- 
tion kitchen and was nearly caught. 
He sailed north again. 

Between Kareelpa and Nargan he 
sawed through a flange and filled the 
kerf with sawdust and fish oil. 

He undermined a boulder and 
rolled it through a concrete track 
section, where the graded way cut a 
sidehill on Waranalin. 

He was always tired. The demands 
of his self-imposed task shut out 
fruitless speculation about aliens. He 
escaped capture by a ten-oar boat 
only because a fogbank gave him 
shelter. He turned east and sailed 
across the widest part of the inner 
sea, careless from short sleep and 
food. He was caught in a storm and 
driven ashore on Damanami. 

Surf smashed the boat to firewood 
on an open beach. He hobbled half a 
day through saltgrass and swamp. 
The purple bruise on his thigh seeped 
blood but the gash from his jawhinge 
to temple was shallow. It opened 
again when he stumbled at the door 
of a basketmaker’s hut and thumped 
his head on a worn chopping block. 
The bed on which he woke was 



covered with rushes over a wooden 
frame. His arms and legs were tied 
with withes to the corners of the 
bed. An old woman was weaving a 
split saltgrass basket. 

“Water,” he said and she paid no 
attention. His throat was tight fire. 
His mouth was swollen shut. 
“Water,” he croaked. 

“So shrivel up,” she said. 

He tried to speak again and got the 
dry heaves. 

“Choke, renegade,” said grandma. 
He contracted his body in fury. 
The bindings held, but the old bed 
did not. It collapsed and he lurched 
to his feet. He swung the headframe 
into the air. 

“Cut my feet loose, mother.” Free 
of the bindings, he rinsed his mouth 
and drank sparingly. “My boat was 
wrecked. Droos and badge ripped 
off. Why renegade?” 

For an answer, she held up her left 
arm. A broad band circled her thin 
wrist. It conformed to the bones and 
tendons, except for a rectangular 
section thicker than the rest. One 
edge of the rectangle was straight and 
white, the other wavy and black. The 
surface was washed with colors that 
changed as CosCros stared. “Give it 
to me.” 

“Can’t cut it. Won’t come off.” 
“What if I cut off your arm?” 

“It defranges,” she said triumph- 
antly. “That means it busts into 
powder. Been hiding a sambat, hah?” 
“Where ’d you get it?” 

“At the poUs. You push your 
hands in a box. If you got a stump 



QUICKENING 



105 




you push it in, too. You got no arms, 
you go to Damanami and they put it 
on your ankle. You be a basket case, 
they stick it on your neck. You got 
no neck, renegade, you don’t need 
one.” 

“What about nulls?” 

“They don’t send Implementors 
after you, is all.’ 

“I thought the steamcars were 
down.” 

“Not enough to stop the vote. 
‘Should we accept the ben-iffy-sent 
gift from the stars?’ Ninety-nine 
point seven. Yes. The starmen carried 
the boxes all over. In the comfort 
and convenience of your own home, 
renegade. No more miserable walk 
every sixday. No more fines when 
you’re sick or—” 

“Attention!” said the bracelet. 

“Yessir,” said the old woman. 
“I’m here. I’m listening.” 

“Your Question Framers ask the 
win of the people. The question is, 
should the steamcar crossing at Bub- 
lara be elevated for the common 
good?” 

“Dearie me, yes.” She pushed the 
white edge. “Where’s Bublara?” 

The bracelet spelled out; Thank 
You. You Have Voted. Then it add- 
ed: The answer is 86.4 per cent Yes. 
88 per cent and gaining. Remember, 
you have one hour to respond before 
your order is delinquent. There is 
one more question framed for today 
to be answered one hour from now. 
Should the skene of Tintenbar be 
allowed to increase the reward for 
the capture of the traitor CosCros? 



Such reward to be an effective addi- 
tion to the bid price? I will repeat 
the question- 

“Where’s your old man?” said 
CosCros. 

“He died.” 

“Two dirty bowls. That droos on 
the peg.” He took her throat in both 
hands. 

“Gone to town,” she said. “They 
don’t pay much for renegades, but 
we need every little bit we can get.” 

He dropped her onto the remains 
of the bed. She glared up at him. He 
put on the droos. “I’ll bounce a rock 
off your head if you stick it out- 
side.” He ran to the swamp and when 
he was hidden from the hut, circled 
back to the footpath. He found he 
was on an island of firm ground. A 
rotten log made a bridge over the last 
of the swamp. The path crossed into 
leafy third-growth skeul. He crossed 
the log and entered the bosky forest. 
He heard the old woman grunt and 
turned in time to catch a billet of 
skeul at the base of his skull. 

W ORDS faded in and faded out. 

“I’m here. I’m here. Pay 
money for CosCros, yes, yes, yes!” 
His head swelled and diminished. His 
eyes focused and faded. She had 
dragged him between two trees, tied 
his feet together around one and his 
arms behind him to another. She was 
happily weaving more peeled bark 
into rope and had knitted him into 
the greenery by the time two Imple- 
mentors and her husband came down 
the trail. 



106 



GALAXY 




They cut him loose, hobbled his 
legs and walked him to the village. 
“Without exception,” said the Imple- 
mentor and forced his hands into the 
alien box. The babble of the bracelet 
drove his ignominious failure through 
his head like a bolt. He was hauled in 
a cage on a cart to the steamcar 
station. Grandma went along for her 
reward. She amused the guards and 
they pointed out places of interest 
on the trip. They showed her the 
scarred hill where the starship had 
settled to manufacture bracelets and 
boxes from rock and seawater. 

CosCros’ bracelet crepitated with 
black on purple. The guards’ flashed 
stalwart green. Grandma’s blipped 
scarlet and orange with avaricious 
joy. GrisOngir’s bracelet was mali- 
cious yellow when he stared through 
the bars at Crux, spat and turned 
away. 

The amphitheater was being en- 
larged when CosCros was put into a 
handsome new cage at Tintenbar. 
Admission to view the rebel was to 
the floor only. Interest was so great 
that guards cleared the arena twice a 
day before feeding time— and if the 
public wanted to view the mad ar- 
sonist at his food another admission 
was charged. An enterprising potter 
cast souvenir mementos of the in- 
famous CosCros meeting his possible 
fates, old-fashioned paper votes were 
sold to choose the most beautiful 
maiden, a company of fishermen 
brought in a record vortvert with 
twelve legs to be kept in a shallow 
tank until needed. 



T he opening ceremonies were 
well worth the doubled admis- 
sion price. The amphitheater over- 
flowed. The notorious CosCros was 
paraded around the arena and every- 
one got a good view of his evil 
features. He was shown the several 
stalls, three on either side of a tall 
striped post with banners on top. 
When the track debouched at the 
post his head would be driven into 
his shoulders. 

One stall held the maiden. An- 
other a pair of snarling irax on light 
chains. The third was filled with 
bladders of excrement. In the stall 
beyond the post stood a man with a 
whip. Next came a stall of bitegrass 
with serrated edges. The last held a 
cook and his coals plus 
succulent viands. One of the stalls 
would be changed every day. The 
trip device on the bottom of the cart 
automatically released the prisoner 
from his bindings in every stall— but 
not at the post. The switches in the 
maze were controlled by the weight 
of water and windmill-driven cams— 
entirely at random. Betting was 
skene-controUed. Get your program 
here! Watch out for cutpurses! A fine 
show . 

CosCros stood on the cart, his 
hands locked to a waist-high bar. 
Dignitaries were introduced. They 
took their places at the rope. To a 
ceremonial flourish of drums, they 
pulled the cart up the amphitheater 
slope. At the top the hook was 
disengaged and a nimble-footed boy 
dragged it down to the arena, the 



QUICKENING 



107 




pulley whirring, to be ready for the 
next day’s ride. 

The cart was trundled to the 
launching platform. A pin was pulled 
and the bar swung forward, locking 
the prisoner prone, his chin on a rest. 

“Do you have any last words?’ 
asked the Ceremony Framer. 

CosCros raised his head and shout- 
ed, “Beware the Question Framers—” 
but the roar of the crowd drowned 
his voice. 

The Ceremony Framer pulled the 
long lever and the cart rolled down 
the incline. It switched left as the 
drums beat, was masked by potted 
trees, zagged right and burst into full 
view through a sheet of water falling 
down the artificial mountain. It slow- 
ed on a rise and stopped on a 
turntable. It chose one of seven 
tracks and eased down into a tunnel. 
It burst into view, rocketing di- 
agonally across the slope. It turned 
on a banked curve near the bottom, 
spent momentum up the hill and 
came to rest on an elevator that took 
it nearly to the top again. Off and 
around, it ran directly for the post, 
spun on a pivot, turned right and ran 
gently toward the irax stall. 

The crowd broke into spontaneous 
applause. It was the finest execution 
ever devised. History was in the 
making. And there would be days 
and sixdays of this delightful celebra- 
tion. 

Silent as a cloud the pale gray 
spaceship settled onto the irax stall. 
The door opened. The yellow ramp 
extended. The cart ran into the 



entryport and the ship lifted. The 
empty cart fell tumbling through the 
air and hit the bladders. The maiden 
shrieked. The ramp sucked in and the 
door shut. The crowd screamed rage. 
The spaceship lifted, twinkled, dis- 
solved and was lost in the sky. 

“What took you so long?” said 
CosCros. 



H e was dizzy and belligerent. 

He had given up friends when a 
friend tried to kill him and here he 
was again, trusting people. The star 
men surrounded him, PeTersNel, 
MariAn, WilDysE, Jen, Fay, BranDer, 
BarBarA and CaMila and CaMila and 
CaMila. She had drawn a tawny dot 
in the middle of each navel. He 
sighed, looked up to meet her laugh- 
ing eyes and was overwhelmed by a 
different sort of dizziness. 

“You had to find out for your- 
self,” said PeTersNel. 

“You’re not Earthmen,” he blurt- 
ed. 

CaMila said, “Told you he was 
smart.” 

“We’re each from a different 
world,” said BranDer. 

“Replacing Earthmen who died 
long and long ago,” said Fay. ‘Tak- 
ing their jobs and their names.” 
“Honor and continuity,” said 
MariAn. 

The skene of Tintenbar shrank in 
the screen. The other islands drew in 
from the edges until CroCros could 
see the whole double loop cast in the 
sea, blurred by clouds. The picture 



108 



GALAXY 




stayed as the spaceship followed the 
world’s rotation at a constant height. 
(bsCros cleared his throat. 

“And now?” 

“Now you make a choice for your 
world,” said PeTersNel. 

Just as he had seen them the first 
lime, they were the contradictory 
|)eople again. They were joy and 
sorrow, challenge and resignation— 
I hey were reason and emotion inex- 
Iricably mixed. They were men and 
women— mankind. 

“It has to do with time?” said 
(bsCros. “The real Earthmen— how 
long to make steamcars?” 

PeTersNel understood. “From a 
slationary steam pump built to lift 
water, to an engine that lifted men to 
llieir single moon, a hundred and 
sixty— plus some— years. Not four 
lifetimes. It took them less than two 
lifetimes more to build this ship.” 
“The impetus must run ahead of 
resource use,” said Fay. 

“Otherwise we crest and falter and 
fail,” said Bar Bar A. 

“How did Earth make it?” 

“To the stars?” said Jen. “Raging 
al the finish line, choking and 
screaming, running through the for- 
esl butting down trees, mad, bloated, 
horrid— and triumphant.” 

“What is the choice I must make?” 
PeTersNel said, “Keep in mind 
I hat the bracelets should interrupt 
I he long downhill slope. The curve 
will break sharply and, in reaction, 
surge up and high.” 

“The tempo will be changed for all 
who live,” said CaMila. 



“The bracelets are subtle things,” 
said WilDysE. ‘They communicate, 
reflect emotion— and they defrange 
at death.” His eyes were hard and 
compassionate. “Or they can be or- 
dered to defrange and cause death.” 
Too many people? Drown half the 
population. Or only one out of 
three? More food, more houses, more 
skeul for the rest— and how many 
would survive instant democracy? 
Kindly kill them now instead of 
letting them starve? He was suddenly 
sick with responsibility. “What is 
good?” 

“We don’t know.” 

“No,” said CosCros. He looked at 
them all. “We’ve done enough. No!” 
CaMila said gently, “Each of us 
made the same choice.” 

“And the Earthmen?” 

“The most advanced race—” 

“They never made that decision 
for another world—” 

“We follow their pattern—” 

The screen showed the floating ice 
of CosCros’ world. They were leav- 
ing. The infinity symbol— of EngUsh 
notation— was fading into the bright 
mottled ball, floating serenely in 
black and star-pricked space. 

“To save Earth, they defranged 
two out of three.” 

CosCros shuddered. 

“All we can do is the best we can 
do,” he said. He was not satisfied. 
The vaulting spirit, the use of power, 
passion and impassion all came to a 
dull— and blazing— irreducible. 

“Keep trying,” he said and joined 
the crew. ★

Every prison wall poses 
this treacherous question— 
which side is the outside? 



DORIS PISERCHIA 



T he television set went first. 

Ruining it took me a long time 
because it was imbedded in the wall. 

The generator was due for a clob- 
bering, but it had to be spared until I 
found out what the weather was like. 
I vented my frustration on the com- 
munications board, tore out wires, 
smashed tubes, made pulp of the 
earphones that had relayed no 
sounds for years. 

The next to die was the library. 
Into the incinerator it went, half a 
shelf at a time. 

I killed practically everything in 
the house that represented a barrier 
between me and the world. 

After clearing away some of the 
debris in the living room I set to 
work on one of the walls at a spot 



110 





where there was supposed to be a 
window. The surface was so hard it 
broke three drill points right away. 

One of the points finally dug in 
and I settled down to some steady 
labor. It had been the right spot to 
start drilling because the point 
rammed through and glass tinkled. 
That sound of breaking glass made 
the beast in my head go wild. For a 
few minutes I was a madwoman. Sick 
with the longing to escape, I thrust 
like a maniac with the drill. All my 
weight was against it as it passed 
beyond the window and struck some- 
thing hard— then the drill slipped out 
of my hands and I fell to the floor. 

I couldn’t believe it. There should 
have been free space beyond the 
glass. The drill ought to have gone on 
through. 

Scrambling up, I jammed my nose 
against the hole and sniffed like a 
starved dog. Did I smell fresh air? 
Christ, was the wind blowing out 
there? 

By the time I drilled a square of 
holes around the window I was 
pooped and quivering. It took a few 
minutes to knock out the square 
with a hammer, then the glass, 
then . 

I came up against another solid 
wall. It was impossible, but beyond 
the glass was another plastic surface 
harder than the one inside. 

The second wall was stronger than 
any drill point in the house and it 



had no business being there. Some- 
body had been pretty clever. They 
had walled up my house without my 
suspecting they were doing it. 

I sat in a chair and stared at that 
shiny square. No drill nor any other 
hand tool would ever make that wall 
yield. No matter. I would wait until 
morning (a figurative expression) and 
then I’d blow the wall away. I had 
plenty of powder. Chad used to work 
in munitions. 

S LEEPING was easier if I lay so 
that the glare of the light hit me 
directly in the face. As I stared at the 
bright bulb I congratulated myself 
for having decided to get out. It 
wouldn’t be bad. At first the thought 
of the plague had paralyzed me so 
that I was afraid the two needs 
would grip me forever in an emotion- 
al crossfire. I had to have some space 
about me and I had to avoid con- 
tamination in case the bug was still 
out there. But it couldn’t possibly 
be. Such a long time had passed. 

There were thousands of tracts 
like this one— a lot of people. 

We locked all the slum people out 
and quarantined ourselves away from 
the sickness. The slummers and their 
rats were responsible for the plague 
in the first place and it was their 
misfortune that they couldn’t fi- 
nance their own safety. They had to 
go on mingling with one another and 
they either lived or died. We on the 



QUARANTINE 



111 




other hand had money to burn and 
we used it to save ourselves. Our 
houses were made completely self- 
sufficient. We planned to do a little 
work and put the finished products 
in pneumatic tubes that would trans- 
fer everything to a storage place 
where it could be picked up when we 
all came out. The automatic dispen- 
sers contained plenty of food and we 
didn’t need doctors because we knew 
internal medicine and surgery. Com- 
munications systems were installed in 
each house and in the beginning we 
called our Congressmen daily. We 
were sorry for the people on the 
outside but felt they should have 
worked harder and earned more and 
saved. 

Things changed. After the first 
year had gone by the Defense people 
suggested that a team go out and 
look the situation over. The Vice 
President thought it was too soon. 
Another year went by and again the 
suggestion was made. No one seemed 
to think it was a good idea. They said 
wait. We did. We waited for a long 
time and eventually we stopped talk- 
ing to each other on the radios. 

Sleep was slow in coming. After 
awhile the light hurt my eyes. I 
closed them and endured the pain of 
a headache, tossed on the bed, tried 
not to think of Chad, then decided 
to go ahead and think about him. 

I should have thought more about 
him in the beginning. Who was it 



wrote about: . what might have 
been? Such was the star by which 
men set their course. 

Chad is— was— insane. Which tense 
applied? 

“There are just the two of us now, 
pet,” he said. “I suppose we should 
thank God that we didn’t catch the 
bug, but how would you like to be 
stuck in here by yourself? Well, 
aren’t you going to answer me?” 

We spent that first day watching 
television. It was as it had been in the 
days after we were married— with 
him looking at me most of the time 
and not at the screen. 

“Remember that old passion I had 
for cooking?” he said. “Now that we 
have so much leisure time I think I’ll 
start giving you a hand in the kit- 
chen.” 

It wasn’t quiet enough in the 
house. I tried keeping the TV off but 
whenever Chad had one of his pacing 
seizures he turned it back on. Oc- 
casionally I switched off the air-con- 
ditioning, but then he complained 
about the stuffiness. He was never 
slow to complain. 

“Why do we have to pretend every 
day from one to three o’clock that 
each of us is alone in the house? It’s 
weird. I get depressed when I can’t 
see or hear you. I’m beginning to feel 
as if I’m locked in a big tomb.” 

Later he said, “You’re kidding. 
Why do we have to extend our 
separation periods? Two hours are 



112 



GALAXY 




plenty. And I disagree with your 
theory. Mental health doesn’t depend 
on solitude and silence. .Human be- 
ings aren’t— oh, hell, it’s just that I 
don’t want to be completely alone. 
I’ve grown jumpy since you moved 
into a room of your own. I have the 
feeling that all the substance is being 
sucked out of the house, as if I were 
being drawn into a vacuum where 
there’s nothing but me.” 

At one time he was in love with 
the library. “I swear the damned 
place is like a museum,” he said. 
“The second I go in and shut the 
door behind me the rot sets in. Why 
can’t I leave the door open? I don’t 
make any noise. Besides, the place is 
a museum. All those rows of micro- 
film boxes are like the eyes of 
history staring at me. What has be- 
come of us? What are we doing here? 
We made a mistake, pet. This is no 
answer. Now wait a minute— calm 
down. I didn’t say anything about 
going out.” 

There was the radio. “Mind if I 
make a call, pet? To whom? To 
anyone. Okay, okay, I’ve forgotten it 
already.” 

Later; “Whoever makes the first 
noise has to reward the other? My 
God, that’s a kid’s game. Hey, wait a 
minute. I’ll play if I get a reward 
first. No? Then I won’t play. What’s 
the matter with me, anyway? Have I 
got bad breath all of a sudden? 
Surely you can’t be enjoying your- 



self. I never see you, I never hear 
you— what is so fascinating about 
being all by yourself?” 

I should have thought of him. 

“No, I don’t want to play any 
more. No, I won’t lower my voice. I 
like the sound of it. I like any sound. 
I wish the place were overrun with 
mice. I wish we had a cat or a dog. 
So help me— oh, hell, I’m sorry, pet. 
For God’s sake— I said I’m sorry. You 
needn’t act like I’ve burst your ear- 
drums. What do you mean I’m disin- 
tegrating?” 

H e began playing his phono- 
graph. As if it weren’t bad 
enough, he selected the worst pieces 
to play— hop junk from the bebop 
era. 

“You’ll just have to move,” he 
said. “My room is at the far end of 
the house, so you’re the pne who will 
have to put distance between us. You 
don’t have to, you know. You could 
come in and listen. It would do you 
good. We could dance. How long has 
it been since we’ve danced? Or 
touched one another? Don’t you get 
hungry for the touch of skin? Here, 
love, take my hand. All right, don’t 
take it, just touch it. Touch, touch, 
touch me. Oh, goddamn, I haven’t 
got leprosy, I only want to be re- 
minded that I’m alive. The senses 
have to be stimulated or you’re dead, 
I don’t want to be dead standing 
up.” 



QUARANTINE

He had to stop following me. My 
pressure point had been tapped and 
from then on it was a choice between 
using defense mechanisms or popping 
a capillary. 

“Why can’t I come in?” he often 
asked— too often. “What are you 
doing in there? It’s so quiet. I can’t 
hear anything. Please open the door. 
I know you’re only sitting there. Let 
me sit with you. I won’t make any 
noise, I promise. We’ll sit together 
and think quietly, or maybe we’ll 
chat about something. Honest to 
God, pet, I don’t think I can stand 
this much longer.” 

After one such display he went 
back to his room and began beating 
his drums. 

“I’m doing no such thing. For 
God’s sake, I don’t own any drums. 
And I haven’t played the phonograph 
for days. I’m merely sitting in this 
damned chair staring at the damned 
wall. What else is there to do?” 

He never stopped drumming. 

“What the devil is that? Oh, come 
on now, what do you think you’re 
doing? I tell you I’m not pounding 
drums and I haven’t worn cleated 
boots since my school days. You 
can’t be serious. The house is big 
enough for us both to enjoy a little 
peace and quiet without this sort of 
thing. I’m warning you, pet, that 
insulated stuff won’t come down 
once it goes up. You seal those 
borders and you’ll have a house 



permanently divided into two sec- 
tions. Oh, God, what’s happening to 
us? What are we becoming? Do you 
hear me? Don’t you care? Damn you 
to hell, go ahead and do it. Thanks 
for leaving a door in the thing. Once 
in a while I’ll come out and see if 
you’re still alive.” 

He had everything he needed on 
his side and I had all I needed on 
mine. Or so I thought. 

I might as well have been in Africa 
and the Rose Bowl simultaneously. 
The drums, the bebop and the boots. 
The drums. The bebop. The boots. 
The son of a bitch. The maniac. 

Was that a scream? 

“I can’t work! Sometimes I think 
it would be a good thing if instead of 
making dynamite sticks and caps I 
made a bomb and blew up the whole 
tract. I can’t figure it out. Some- 
thing’s happening and I don’t know 
what it is. I’m starving to death for 
substance. I wake up from dream 
conversations and I want to shriek 
because they aren’t real. I think of 
bodies all around me and I want to 
reach out and grab them. I want to 
strip naked, have an orgy, wallow 
with a hundred women, but most of 
all I want to hear them. I want to 
hear something besides my own 
heartbeats. Please, please, please, 
please, please—” 

Something was making a din so 
terrible that my brain cells threat- 
ened to shatter. How did you track a 



114 



GALAXY 




noise t o its source when it was 
everywhere around you? I did the 
impossible. I tracked that sound 
from room to room until I came to a 
small opening in a thick wall. There 
was the source of my agony. 

The sounds, the screams from far 
off, the thumping from the other 
side of a door that was no longer 
open. Somebody had been right. 
Nothing short of dynamite would 
break that sealing. 

Defense mechanisms were impreg- 
nable. 

I N THE morning I went back to 
work on the wall. It took hours 



to drill indentations deep enough to 
hold the caps, hours that rubbed my 
hands raw and broke my back, yet 
they were hours sublime because for 
the first time in years I was doing 
something that had a sane purpose. 

Not exactly as in Jericho, a section 
of the wall came tumbling down with 
a loud crack of dynamite. 

My claustrophobia was driving me 
wacky, making my hands fumble, 
putting a watery sensation in my 
knees that sent me to the floor a 
half-dozen times before I managed to 
get my head through that hole. 

I spent five minutes running 
through my vocabulary of profanity

"I loved sf as a child and I still do,” says 
Doris Piserchia. "I write it for fun— and 
because it lets me say anything I please. Sf 
is so much less restrictive than the main- 
stream—” 

Nevertheless, it was not until her late 
thirties that Doris became a writer. We 
asked how she finds the time to keep it 
up, now that she has five children. 

"For me, writing is possible only when I 
stick to a strict schedule. I start working in 
the morning as soon as the last child gets 
on the school bus. If I'm facing a deadline 
or doing something especially interesting. 
I'll put in time in the evenings as well.” 

Not only has Doris a busy life; she has 
an exceptionally busy mind. Consider her 
goals, and her views on sf's future. 

"I intend to make women prominent in 
my writing. This is a difficult thing to do, 
since I'm as conditioned as everyone else. 
In literature, females have few lofty mo- 
tives or sexual musts, and since writers 



learn from' reading they tend to write in 
the same vein as others before them. 
Besides, putting down on paper what I 
know so well in my head is like super- 
imposing myself on a bull's-eye for readers 
to throw darts at. 

"We had the Nuclear Age, and now it is 
Minority Groups time. We're all saying, 
'Look, I'm as human as you are.' Whether 
or not we're listening to each other is 
questionable. 

"But science fiction can handle the 
gripes and the dreams of everybody. It is a 
wide-open field, and that's why nearly all 
writers will probably land in it sooner or 
later. More than one writer has claimed 
that sf is the literature of the future ... it 
may very well turn out to be true." 

Doris Piserchia's first book, MISTER 
JUSTICE, came out on the stands in May 
of this year. A second book, STAR 
RIDER, will be published by Bantam in 
the near future.

because of all the times to break out 
I had to do it in the dead of night. 
There was nothing to do but wait for 
morning. 

Morning never came. It might have 
helped if I’d gone to bed and rested. 
I sat in my big chair with my eyes on 
that hole and waited for the sun to 
come up. Patiently I waited for my 
beast to die. There must be space, 
beautiful emptiness that drained the 
pressure away from one’s bones, 
wonderful sunshine that sped to in- 
finity, vigorous wind that first belted 
and then fled, little drops of rain 
falling from far overhead. 

I never once looked at my watch 
but eventually I realized that if 
morning were ever going to come it 
had already come and was out there 
beyond that hole. I still saw nothing 
but blackness. 

A flashlight was no good, showing 
me only the cracked sidewalk 
the shiny surfaces on the nearby 
houses. A quick rummage in the 
basement to grab up a couple of 
flares and a beacon— then I crawled 
out through the hole and walked up 
the street. I had to move with cau- 
tion to avoid the holes made by rain 
and wind over the years. 

I stood in the middle of the street 
and set up the beacon. It was a good 
view I got of whatever that thing was 
where the sky should have been. 
Because of the condition of the 
streets I knew it had been put up 



recently. It was an endless length 
that glinted in the beacon’s light like 
a sheet of solid steel. 

It was everywhere overhead. I 
know because I tracked that lightless 
cage from one end to the other and 
back again, and I didn’t quit until the 
flares were gone and the battery in 
the beacon was as dead as the chunk 
of heart in my chest. 

Now I sit in my big chair and do 
nothing. The hole in the wall is 
sealed because a crypt isn’t a proper 
crypt when it opens to the outside. 
There’s an outside beyond the hole 
but it is just a bigger crypt and all 
that quiet and darkness is more than 
I can take. As long as I have to be 
bqried I’ll take it small. 

I may be the only one who knows 
the secret. They survived out there, 
and now they’ve giving us back in 
kind. We locked them out, they have 
locked us in. 

They are more humane than we 
were. They haven’t contaminated our 
air or cut off our food supplies. We 
will go on living until the last one of 
us is gone and then maybe they’ll 
stop building things on top of us. 
One day they will excavate the whole 
works and start all over again. 

I sit in my big chair and worry. My 
sources of diversion were destroyed 
by my own hand. I know that one 
day I won’t be able to control my 
longing to talk to somebody. The 
only one around is Chad. ★

The unit performed reflexive-

S.C., when, in a strange circum- 
stance . 

H JEK was climbing over great 
rocks, up a slope rising to a 
plateau. He stopped his climb and 
listened carefully. The red earth of 
the desert was still and windless that 
day, and there were no sounds but 
those made by living things. He 
recognized the whir and rumble of an 
approach ing/^fl«> 2 . 

Below, at the base of the slope, he 
saw it move into sight, fat and shiny. 
It jiggled and meandered, steering 
around the bigger rocks that it could 
not climb. Its sound was a whine like 
a baby’s hunger cry.

Hjek knew that these things had 
watchful eyes and could see a great 
distance. He crouched, grinding his 
heels into the dirt beneath him. 
Slowly he laid his long-bladed sword 
and his spear over his lap and leaned 
his elbows on his knees. He minded 
himself that he must be like the bluk, 
the giant rock sloth. He had even 
seen a bluk when he was a boy. Now 
no one saw them. Like every kind of 
great hunting beast, they were no 
more. The Old Gutu remembered 
how the f’gaiin had slaughtered. No 
hunting beasts and very few Gutu 
remained. 

Hjek himself was a great warrior. 
He had stamped out the teeth of 
seven of the f’gaiin that he killed. He 
was clever and could make the Old 
Gutu laugh and nod their heads at 
him, and his body and spirit were 
strong so that women admired him. 
But Hjek was right to fear the stran- 
gers. They were deadly, especially 
the ones that wore gray and rode 
inside the shiny beasts. 

The thing below picked its way all 
around the slope. Hjek lowered his 
inner eyelid, clouding his vision. He 
could still watch the form of the 
thing moving. In his mind he thought 
of his new woman. She was young 
and ardent. He dropped one hand to 
the ground and scratched the warm 
dirt and wondered if she would soon 
be fat and let out a boychild. He had 
made his first woman fat, but then 
the strangers had caught and killed 
her. It had been a very bad thing. It 
had made him weep and for many 



days his anger had been too great for 
even his brothers to come near him. 

Hjek raised his inner lid. The 
creature had stopped almost directly 
beneath him. Tightness filled his 
throat and his body tensed. But the 
thing moved on and Hjek relaxed and 
thought that it looked like a big bug. 
The comparison pleased him. He 
smiled. And then Hjek expanded on 
his idea. He made a picture in his 
mind— in it the creature looked 
exactly like the awkward beetle 
which sometimes fell from the ele- 
phant trees. Hjek had crushed some 
of these under his foot. In his mind 
he imagined his foot crushing the 
thing below. He was happy with 
himself and laughed. He would go 
home and tell everyone his idea. 
They would laugh, even the Old 
Gutu. Hjek was clever. He laughed so 
hard that he closed his eyes and his 
body rocked with mirth. 

When he opened his eyes again, 
still aching with joy, he saw that the 
creature had turned onto a ramp of 
slag and was climbing the slope. It 
had already come very close to him. 

H jek was seized with terror, for 
he could feel that the thing’s 
eyes were on him. He jumped to his 
feet and searched for the best way to 
run. Near his head a rock shattered 
and splinters flew into his face. Hjek 
slapped at his cheeks and bloodied 
his palm. The creature was drawing 
much closer, screaming in its climb 
up the slag, and its guns spoke. 



120 



GALAXY 




Rocks shattered and sprayed Hjek 
with fragments each time it fired. 
Suddenly Hjek’s body Was thrown 
down on the rocks. He felt a terrible 
burning in his bowels. He scrambled 
up and pulled his body over the 
nearest rocks. 

Everywhere he went rocks broke 
up and showered him and he could 
see blood gushing from his side. The 
thing had thrown something into 
him. He was hurt badly. 

Hjek reached the crest and crawled 
onto the plateau, but the creature 
had made the easy climb up the slag 
and bounced over the crest just 
behind him. Hjek started to run away 
at an angle. In the center of the pla- 
teau he saw a tall column of rocks the 
thing could never climb. He opened 
his lungs and ran as hard as he could, 
lowering his inner lids so that his 
eyes did not burn. 

The thing screamed behind him 
and the guns started to fire. Hjek 
opened his eyes and saw the ground 
before him blowing up puffs of dust. 
And then he was struck. A chunk of 
his thigh flew away. He was hit in the 
right shoulder and stumbled. He was 
hit three times over his body, each 
time hard, and he spun round and 
dropped to his knees. He saw the 
creature grow large, flames rippling 
on its face. 

Hjek was close to death. He could 
not draw his breath and his body felt 
broken. His inner flesh seethed. He 
stumbled to his feet and tilted his 
face to the sky, wanting to gasp, 
trying to call to the sun. Anger 



seared his brain. He cocked his spear 
arm and pitched his whole body. His 
spear flew away and then his lungs 
expelled their air and flecks of blood 
and a thin piercing scream— the death 
scream of his race. Hjek’s body shud- 
dered and collapsed. 

The creature stopped near the 
body and the top popped open. An 
animal that looked like Hjek jumped 
down. He was like Hjek, but he was 
smaller and his body was covered 
with gray fabric. He wore the jeweled 
insignia of a commander of the fleet. 

Hjek’s flesh was the color of his 
world and so he had worn nothing at 
all. His body was spread-eagled, face 
to the sun. His eyes were open but 
saw nothing. His sword lay behind 
him, fallen from his hand. The 
f’gaiin stalked cautiously around 
Hjek’s body. He stopped. With both 
hands he tugged at the sword and 
dragged it to Hjek’s hand and drop- 
ped the pommel into Hjek’s palm. 
Hjek, of course, did not know that 
he had been done this kindness.

construction. It is a self-ter- 
minating planet due to an aber- 
ration in its orbit and axis. The 
axis inclines sharply toward its 
star and Zetha follows a reduc- 
ing orbit, which draws it into 
Omega Medusa. All present life 
forms will perish under increas- 
ing temperatures. Also, stress 
on the planet creates violent 
geologic shifting, which may in 
time cause the body to break 
up in space. The southern hem- 
isphere of Zetha is largely froz- 
en to the 36th parallel. The 
central belt of the planet is 
marine and has a complex ma- 
rine ecology. The terrestial 
ecology is concentrated in the 
northern hemisphere, which is 
a single continent to the 40th 
parallel. The polar cap to the 
12th parallel is hot and arid. A 
single people live on Zetha, 
primarily in desert caves and in 
the surrounding forests. They 
are a primitive humanoid: 
Homo Gutu Zethanus. A cou- 
sin species of sub-People homi- 
nids dwell in the dense forests. 
They are commonly called 
Zethans and were mistakenly 
classed as a People with the 
Confederacy until the error 
was corrected in 6282 S.C. In 
6275 S.C., Zetha was entered 
into the Galactic Confederacy 
as a non-participating protec- 
torate with a civil directory. 
The directory was militarized 
in . 



From The Little Handbook 
of Planets, a pamphlet by 
Dr. Horace Amayn Woo 

R obinson dosed the Gutu ’s fin- 
gers over the swordhilt with his 
foot. They cared to die with their 
weapons gripped. He knew much 
about them. For seventeen years he 
had chased the Gutu, hounded them, 
butchered them in the desert. And 
for seventeen years he had watched 
the sun come closer. The heat of this 
world had sucked him dry. He was a 
cinder, spare and lean. 

Robinson snapped up the visor of 
his helmet and squinted. He stood on 
the tenth parallel. The searing sun 
was overhead. It was early morning. 
So bright was the light that he could 
not distinguish the timeless still 
shapes nor the dull red of the desert. 
He pulled the screen back over his 
eyes. 

The commander’s skin was dark, 
colored by birth by the mixing of his 
ancestors and blackened under the 
Zethan sun. His hair was a tangle of 
black wool. His eyes were blue so 
dark that some men thought them 
black, and his gaze had power that 
pierced like a stake through a man 
and pinned his soul to the wall. He 
was not handsome. The hawks and 
eagles of his mother Earth resembled 
him. 

The warrior lay on his back staring 
at the star to which he prayed in life. 
Already the reddish irises were faded, 
the eyes dry. This was a big one. 
Robinson leaned over the corpse to 



122

estimate its length. Over eight feet. 
He jerked back his head. The odor of 
blood mixed with the contefits of the 
Gutu’s bowels evaporated from a 
large hole in the warrior’s belly. 

Robinson kneeled by the Gutu’s 
head. It had the flat face of its race, a 
heavy browridge and shallow fore- 
head. Robinson reached under the 
skuU and gripped a knot of black 
hair. He tugged, turned the head. 
Twined in the knot of hair were 
colored strings, "^beads and human 
teeth. This one had killed a half 
dozen or so offworlders. Robinson 
thought he recognized the Gutu, a 
rogue warrior involved in perhaps 
twenty raids in recent years. He 
pulled a thin-bladed knife from his 
boot and sliced through the hair at 
the back of the head. These souvenirs 
brought a thousand visigulls from 
cargo sailors who in turn got four or 
five times as much offworld. 

The heat prickled his skin. The 
moisture fried from the flesh and the 
flesh stung. He had to go back to 
cover. He walked to his tractor, 
threw in the souvenir, then climbed 
the side and plopped into the cab. He 
reached overhead and drew down the 
bubble, locked it in place. The refrig- 
erator blew cool air over his legs. 
Robinson sighed and reached for the 
microphone. But when he keyed the 
transmitter, the emergency power 
relays shut down the cooler. He 
kicked the floorboard to switch on 
the refrigeration again. 

Commander of a yard full of junk! 
The 551st with its record of gallantry 



was fit to be scuttled. It was an 
undermanned gang of assassins, 
staffed by the fleet’s unwanteds and 
equipped from a scrap heap. Robin- 
son’s vehicle was sixty years old. 
They had plucked it out of the 
garbage and sent it to him for ser- 
vice— and it ran only because he paid 
out of his pocket for parts from 
private dealers and did his own main- 
tenance. He was constantly afraid for 
himself and his men. Their creaking 
clanking dog carriages had broken 
down in the past and Robinson had 
the memory of what two days be- 
calmed in the desert could do to a 
man. 

Robinson gazed a final time at the 
body. You are a fine animal, he 
thought, but it’s good you’re dead. 
They looked so much like Terrans. 
They behaved in many ways like 
men, but their brains were small, 
primitive. Once caught in the open 
they were easy prey to the genocidal 
machinery that Robinson command- 
ed. Robinson thought it ironic that 
the Confederacy liked to work the 
races together, humanoid with 
humanoid, arachnoid with arachnoid, 
in order to facilitate understanding. 
And here the likeness facilitated 
murder. 

And the hot face of the sun came 
nearer. Zetha’s brazen mother called 
her home. Never enough Gutu died. 
They were tenacious and fierce and 
deadly in their turn. Robinson won- 
dered if the Gutu knew that the only 
thing he and they were killing was 
each other’s time.

C HIEF Petty Officer Delphmius 
sat on a stump by the gate. He 
was filled with an inexplicable un- 
easiness, but thirty-four years as a 
fleet man had taught him to trust his 
intuitions. He waited now for the 
reassurance of seeing his friend and 
commander. At least he could tell 
Robinson. Robinson would take 
heed, be watchful. Robinson had the 
instinct for trouble, too. 

Delphinius had been in trouble aU 
his life. He liked to tell men that and 
grin. His grin lacked a lot of teeth, 
and his face was pitted and lacerated, 
a free-form pattern of scars. Sweat 
trickled from under his dust-colored 
curls over the smooth skin of his 
scalp and dripped into his eyebrows. 
He dabbed at his face with thick 
fingers, flicked away sweat. 

Next to Robinson, Delphinius had 
been on Zetha longer than any 
man— fourteen years. He had shared 
the anguish of the long campaign 
with Robinson. Both men had be- 
come dry and dessicated in mind and 
body. Both were unwelcome among 
their rightful peers. Both were being 
punished. They had swilled together 
in hot brandy through hot nights, 
degrading their natures with the hot 
and stupid bodies of hairless Zethan 
apes. 

Delphinius stared between his 
chunky thighs and tried to remember 
a cooler place. He had been so long a 
fleet man that he had lost the dialect 
of his native agricultural colony. At 
home they spoke a blend of Simplin- 
gual and frenched Anglic-Terran with 



moans and gutturals and spatulated 
vowels. And the vixen Zethan sun 
had lately burned into his brain vivid 
memories of Messedorn, the family 
groves, his father’s manicured fields, 
the stream at Eddys Market 
and the girls with whole armfuls of 
pink and orange flowers. He snorted 
and watched his sweat drip between 
his legs. He had been a bullish boy, 
not very bright after all, and too 
heavy-handed and eager to fight. 
Exasperated, his father had finally 
thrown a tote bag at him and said, 
“Y’ll git yer butt up and jine wit’ 
fleet roit noo, bucky bee. Git off!” 

Delphinius was assistant com- 
mander of Gamma Company. Gam- 
ma was the star company in the 
551st. Robinson staffed it with his 
best veterans and the most likely 
recruits and used it to spearhead 
every operation. Gamma was sitting 
ready to begin the newest of the 
interminable sweeps. They waited 
for Robinson who was coming the 
two hundred kilometers from head- 
quarters at Lake Serenity. 

The companies of the 551st were 
deployed evenly spaced in a ring 
around the desert. Each company 
had its command post in a square 
cleared of elephant trees. The squares 
were walled and in the center were 
half-sunken barracks. Delphinius liked 
the elephant trees. Everyone did. 
They gave shade. They were huge 
plants, some over a hundred feet 
high, and on their umbrella-frame 
branches enormous leaves grew. The 
leaves had a thick cellulose and 



124 



GALAXY 




mucuous skin on top which let in sun 
but let off no moisture. The sunlight 
let in by and the humidity trapped 
under the canopy fed the secondary 
growth that once nurtured Zetha’s 
big game. The leaves gave the plant 
its name. They looked like the ears 
of Terran pachyderms. A man had to 
be careful that a dead leaf falling did 
not catch him and knock him down. 
It had happened. 

T he sentry pulled open the gate 
and saluted Robinson’s vehicle as 
it trundled into the compound. Del- 
phinius watched the commander dis- 
mount and start toward him. He 
measured the officer’s stride, judged 
his mood. Robinson was intent, a bit 
gloomy. 

All the men watched the com- 
mander walk across the dirt. Three 
troop carriers, dully polished, waited 
against the far wall. Tenders and 
drivers who had moved in and out of 
the vehicles, finishing their prepara- 
tions, now stood and wiped their 
hands with rags. The company com- 
mander climbed out of his hut and 
stood rather stiffly at the ready. 

The six new Vupeculans squatted 
down to gamble. Robinson strode 
over to them and kneeled into their 
circle. One of tliem shuffled handfuls 
of multicolored disks in his fingers 
and then, when the others burbled 
anxiously, scattered them before 
himself. Bald heads bobbed. A fren- 
zied round of clucking started. They 
stabbed with delicate fingers and 
plucked up disks, threw them down 



again. Robinson played. At the end 
of the round, Robinson held up his 
disks. The Vupeculans chortled and 
made oval smiles with sphincter 
mouths and their nostrils puckered in 
and out, meaning no. Robinson was a 
bad player. He threw in his chips and 
the others flapped their fingers and 
argued out the tally. Only their 
sergeant spoke Simplingual. His head 
nodded up and down and he greeted 
Robinson, “Haddo, Comamer. 
Haddo.” 

Delphinius knew the Vupeculans 
were cursed to have been sent here. 
They would all be dead in months. 
Their race burned up on Zetha. Their 
blood dried and they always seemed 
to die at night, weeping and shiver- 
ing. The last to die would die alone, 
surrounded by Terrans who did not 
know his language or his medicine. 
And he would not even be able to 
comprehend the compassion in the 
alien faces that watched his life seep 
out. 

Robinson straightened up. “What 
are the men doing out. Lieutenant?” 

The company commander grim- 
aced. He was new and he remem- 
bered his first meeting with Robinson. 
The commander had promised to kill 
him if ever again he set the troops 
outside in the heat for a regulation 
inspection. “They wanted the air, sir. 
It’s been cool. Under a hundred and 
twenty all day.” 

“Well, it’s hot topside. A hundred 
sixty-three at the tenth. Get ’em 
mounted up and cooled down.” 

“Aye aye, sir.” The lieutenant 



CIRCLE OF FLIES 



125 




looked at the chief. “Give the order, 
Mr. Delphinius.” 

Delphinius opened his mouth and 
took a breath. Rapid-fire orders 
rumbled out of the chamber of his 
chest. Petty officers echoed the com- 
mand. The men of Gamma Company 
climbed to their feet, lumbered out 
of the barracks, each lugging his gear. 
They lined up, threw packs and rifles 
into the • carriers and clambered 
aboard. The lieutenant saluted Rob- 
inson and pivoted on his heel. 

Delphinius started at once. “It’s 
got me all tied up, the last day or 
two, sir. I’m a-fret thinkin’ sumpin’s 
up, but I dunno. I dunno.” 

Robinson frowned. He watched 
the little Vupeculans scamper into 
the last carrier. The motors hummed 
and the doors were sealed shut. 
“We’re just going to sweep sector 
nine. Tremors have been minimal all 
over the topside for the last two 
weeks. But there have been Gutu 
sighted all through the tree line in 
the sector.” 

“Aye, well. There’s been no shakes 
till now. No doubt we’ll doodle into 
the wrath of hell.” 

Zetha, falling on its face, was 
subject to grand earthquakes, to ran- 
dom breaking of the crust, volcanic 
gushers, sudden fissures that un- 
zipped in the blink of an eye and 
frenetic sprays of steam and gas. A 
man, a vehicle, a whole army could 
be swallowed by an abrupt, capri- 
cious hunger of the planet for flesh 
and steel. The disruptive quakes were 
a peril greater than the Gutu, al- 



though wandering warriors often 
hacked the flesh off those stalled by 
eruptions. And fierce electrical 
storms in the brittle air had made 
surveillance flights and gunships an 
impossibility from the start. They 
also— frequently— distorted and de- 
stroyed radio communication and 
had made power rays and blasters 
useless, even dangerous. The 551st 
relied on old-fashioned big-bore bul- 
lets to knock down berserk Gutu 
charges. 

“I wouldn’t worry, Delphie. Five 
days out and back.” 

D elphinius snorted. Then he 

abruptly recalled something, and 
plunged a hand inside his field suit, 
withdrew a lavender postal tube and 
handed it to Robinson. “Came with 
cargo yesterday, sir.” 

Robinson snatched it anxiously 
and popped it open. He had waited 
months for this reply. It took his 
breath and raced his heart to roll 
open the scroll. The paper was heavy, 
translucent— expensive stationery. He 
blinked at it and pressed his lips 
together. It had been calligraphed by 
some scribe in Sirenian script, 
unfamiliar lettering to a man who 
seldom had intercourse with patri- 
cians. And it was composed in the 
artful dialect of the Capital, a blend 
of languages affected by people of 
affairs. Robinson’s letter had been 
written in terse Simplingual, the only 
form of composition he had ever 
learned. He unraveled the phrases 
patiently.

To Commander S. V. Robin- 
son, FGC, Subaltern Director- 
General of the Provisional Pro- 
tective Military Directory of 
Zetha, Commander of Forces; 

From C. Frank Markos, 
President, Markos Presenta- 
tions, Inc., et alia, etcetera. 

To my friend Robinson, 
greetings! 

I was most flattered and 
pleased to receive your private 
post. Flattered that you should 
look to me for help in a time 
of serious difficulty— pleased 
that the differences of years 
past do not restrict our con- 
tinuing relationship. 

You have served as a bril- 
liant and inspirational example 
to me. Your heroic exploits at 
the now famous Battle of the 
Mouth of Brythis not only 
enriched me with material for 
my news correspondence and 
commercial dramatic presenta- 
tions, but also provided me an 
example of stirring courage and 
manly leadership. 

I did not neglect to notice 
your mention of a personal 
debt and this I concede to 
owing you after using, without 
your permission, your name 
and identity as the basis for a 
fictional hero. However, at the 
time I assumed you would not 
be displeased. I am enclosing a 
draft against my treasury de- 
posit at Napor Silento in the 
Antigones, closest to you, for 



twenty thousand visigulls. You 
can cash it there at your leisure 
or the Negotiator at the Napor 
Silento Currency Services 
Agency, a Mister Eu, will ar- 
range transfer to your account 
anywhere for a simple two per 
cent fee. I would trust no other. 

As regards the wide-spread 
corruption and exploitation, 
which you claim goes on vis-a- 
vis the miners and government 
services on Zetha, I can only 
caution you to guard the rhe- 
toric of your accusations. It is 
true I have made much of my 
name and wealth as a respected 
news agent and analyst, but my 
career has been guided by pru- 
dent consideration for avoid- 
ance of seriously complicated 
controversy and my long ex- 
perience in and with the ruling 
circles of our universe prompt 
me to advise you to wait 
solemnly for retirement 
and . 

R obinson grunted, snarled and 
ripped up the letter. The two 
men watched curiously the pieces 
float to the ground and lie dormant. 
“He means to buy me off!” 

“Sir?” 

‘This,” said Robinson and thrust 
his finger into the tube. He withdrew 
a yellow personal draft, tossed aside 
the tube and began to tear the draft 
in two. He paused. 

So much for his crusade for jus- 
tice. So much really for his fight to 



CIRCLE OF FLIES

save himself and his men from 
tedious death in hell. Markos had 
been the last and worst chance. 
Robinson stared back through his 
memory at the pallid, clammy little 
man who had wet his pants in the 
pitch of battle— which had been more 
slaughter than battle— and then had 
run off to produce videos about 
Bloody Jack Robinson and the 
551st, starring Shane Shang. 

“Mr. Delphinius.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

‘Take this draft. After we return 
from this mission, arrange to have 
this amount put into my treasury 
account. You can do business with a 
negotiator, a Mr. Eu of Napor Si- 
lento. He comes well regarded. While 
we’re out I want you to figure— get 
Busic to help you with the figures— I 
want you to figure a fair system of 
distribution of this money as a prize 
to the five-fifty-first.” 

“Yes, sir!” 

Robinson left Delphinius staring at 
the draft, dumfounded. It had cost 
him his pride to go begging to 
Markos. And this is a good example 
of why, he thought, a man should 
never bargain with his pride. But the 
hand that slaps your face may at the 
same time hold a reward. To an- 
nounce a prize was an honor and a 
privilege for an officer, a pleasure 
almost always reserved to a ship’s 
captain when his crew grappled a 
floater or disabled an enemy vessel. 
Robinson was pleased to act like the 
space-going captain he had dreamed 
of becoming and would never be. 



The last prize had been announced 
to the 551st when they had seized 
the treasure cache of the Kilton 
Pirates at Baidn and fleet retained a 
percentage to reward the forces. If 
they were to seize anything of value 
on Zetha the mining companies 
would demand it as compensation 
for their losses and the directory 
would fairly well give it to them and 
swap favor for favor later. 

Robinson jumped into the cockpit 
of his tractor, slammed down the 
bubble and poured himself a glass of 
Vuito, the lusty orange liquor of the 
Nuns of Kjimk, pudgy little reptilian 
females who had found that their 
divine nectar was worth a fortune in 
exports. He sipped the Vuito and 
controlled his breathing, relaxing 
himself. 

It had cost Robinson the flower of 
his lifetime to sweat in the Zethan 
dungheap. He would take his pitiable 
rewards where he might. He had not 
been offworld in eleven years. He 
was held on emergency orders and he 
was kept from early retirement by an 
order of exigency— and they would 
no doubt try to assassinate him when 
he did retire. They had reason to fear 
him. 

Robinson shifted the gears in the 
tractor and rolled out through the 
company gate. His rabble clattered 
along behind.

port as was their custom. With each 
violent shake of the ground they 
burbled anxiously and squeezed 
more closely together. It suited the 
rest of the men who had more room, 
even enough to lie down. 

Delphinius had predicted rightly. 
In two hours, three big quakes had 
bumped the troop carriers to a stand- 
still. The last had ripped a wide 
chasm across their path, necessitating 
a wide detour. Delphinius’ voice 
boomed on the intercom: “Here we 
go, lads, a big one starboard.” 

The men peered through the ports. 
Fifty yards from the vehicle the 
ground swelled and cracked like a 
fast-baking loaf. The floor of the 
carrier shivered. Then red vapor shot 
from the cracks and suddenly a 
chunk of ground was bjown away 
and a geyser of steam soared far 
overhead. Everyone went back to his 
seat. Sometimes the steam pockets 
took days to blow out. 

Finch, a brawny brigrat from 
Terra Nova, lay on his back, his 
knees up. He was a scrapper and a 
chronic fence jumper and the Terran 
Fleet had finally given up and sent 
him to Zetha. Finch blinked, tighten- 
ed his face and quickly broke wind 
like a small clap of thunder. 

“Finch, you’re a disgust.” Brope 
was sitting at Finch’s feet, his arms 
crossed and his feet stretched out. He 
was an ox of a man born on Garday. 
His father was Terran, his mother 
Shesemii. Frequently the children of 



such a mating were mules. On that 
account, Brope suffered a little less 
than most of the men because he had 
no sexual appetite. 

“Me the disgoost?” said Finch. 
“Why, ’tis yoo, Brope, joost to look 
at the loomp of fat on yer shoul- 
ders.” The rest of the men laughed, 
except the Vupeculans, who kept 
their own counsel. Brope was the 
squad leader, but it was all right to 
have fun with him. He was simple 
and good-natured. His error had been 
that he killed a man, inadvertently, 
in a bone-crushing embrace in an 
attempt to keep the man from de- 
serting. Brope was innocent but dan- 
gerous. Fleet sent him to Zetha. Very 
few realized he had been there for 
ten years. 

Brope also happened to speak a 
little Vupeculan. He had gotten 
around in his time. His squad was 
always given the little men. He 
tried to explain to the others that the 
Vupeculans got there like anybody 
else. In the Vupeculan culture there 
were seventeen cardinal Disgraces. 
The six men with Brope had com- 
mitted one, which was to enter a 
village looking for imimiv on one of 
the liege lord’s sanguinary days. The 
six Vupeculans had confessed after 
reciting the grueling prayers of con- 
trition during a vigil beneath the 
black obelisk of Oimoidin. In a less 
enlightened day they would have 
been punished by having two of the 
three sperm ducts pared out of the 
crotch. Now they were assigned to 
Zetha.

“Now, Brope,” said Finch, “they 
tell me here that yoo be knowin’ all 
there is aboot our fine purposes here 
on Zetha.” Finch was a new man. He 
had been cautioned to set up the 
right relationship with Brope, which 
meant to keep a little distance. Brope 
had religious ideas. But Brope always 
knew what there was to know about 
Robinson, Zetha and the 551st. 

“There are no fine purposes on 
Zetha,” said Brope. 

“Meanin’ what?” Finch propped 
his head on his helmet and stared at 
Brope from between his knees. 

“Meaning that.” 

“Well, what is it we be up to 
then?” 

“We ride around like so. We go to 
all the various caves we know they’ve 
lived in before and search. Maybe we 
find an old man or some women, 
maybe even a buck or two. We kill 
them and when the time comes we 
go back and sit.” 

“Well, noo, tell me what this war 
be aboot.” 

“There is no war.” 

“Well, then, who the hell be I?” 

“You’re Finch and you’re a dis- 
gust.” 

T he men laughed and Brope 
thumped his head on his helmet. 
“Brope, yoo’re an idiot,” he said. 
“Finch, here’s how it is. You’re in 
garrison. You’re police. You protect 
the good Gutu from the bad Gutu.” 
Finch thought a while. “Ah-hah! 
But there be no good Gutu.” 

“There you are.” Brope stared a 



while at nothing. “When it all began 
was when they found this place, see? 
The miners worked this planet with 
no licenses. But then the Confeder- 
acy come along and told the miners 
they’d have to negotiate with the 
natives, the rightful landlords here, 
which is the way the Confederacy 
looks at things. But the Gutu are a 
mean lot and pretty stupid anyway— 
and they don’t negotiate, see. So the 
miners come up with a plan to have 
the little ape people be the natives 
and they set it up that way, with a 
tribal synod and a request for a 
directory. Then the miners just brib- 
ed off all the directors who came, 
and they got the troopers to come 
here and start killing the Gutu be- 
cause, as they put it, the Gutu were 
killing the good Confederated 
people” 

“Ah!” said Finch. 

“That was when Robinson and 
this outfit come here.” 

One of the men laughed. “Tell him 
’bout the rape.” 

Finch’s eyes brightened. “A rape, 
now.” 

“It was but it wasn’t. You see, 
there was this lieutenant-commander 
had a little gaf ape that he screwed 
with. Well, a trooper come by one 
day and sees her, throws her down 
and screws with her as well. The 
lieutenant-commander caught him 
and court martialed him for rape of a 
native and all. Well, away off some- 
where, some bureaucrat starts feed- 
ing all this into his computer for 
storage and the computer spits it

back out and says it can’t be rape to 
rape an animal. That’s .when the 
works got twisted up and the bureau- 
crats figured it out that the apes 
can’t be the natives. So they made 
the Gutu the natives again.” Brope 
pulled on his nose and sat placidly 
staring at the opposite bulkhead. 

Finch sat up. “So?” He jabbed 
Brope with his foot. “Well, what’s 
the rest of it, then?” 

“There isn’t any rest of it.” 

“Well, what’s Robinson and all 
them doin’ aboot it?” 

Brope nodded. “There are two 
kinds of people here. Those who take 
their money and have a good time 
messing up the place and those who 
keep their mouths shut and do the 
humping. Robinson can’t do any- 
thing. Last time he went on leave, he 
went off to the Ministry of Peoples 
on The Siren and requested an audi- 
ence and come damn close to getting 
in. Then they arrested him and 
shipped him back. It’s all he can do to 
keep us off the field as much as he 
can— and he keeps away from Lake 
Serenity where he’s not wanted and 
where he’s apt to wind up cold dead 
on his ass if he doesn’t watch out.” 
“Ah, Brope!” 

“Ah nothing. This is money you’re 
talking about and plenty of it.” 
Delphinius’ voice broke over the 
intercom again. “Here it is, lads.” 
The carrier stopped and the men 
went to the ports. 

It was the Mouth of Brythis. 



Brope had seen it. He went back to 
his seat. 

Brythis was the devil-god of the 
Utixu who swallowed up in his hor- 
rible maw wayward children who 
stole or pestered cripples or played 
with their genitals. Brythis seized 
adults, too, but those he chewed. 

The Mouth was an immense bowl, 
more awesome than anything else in 
Zetha’s elaborate, torn landscape. In 
the mindless past, rifts had formed in 
the mantle below and moisture had 
been forced up through the crust. 
Rushing into the rifts and hollows 
had come magma and malten miner- 
als, a natural alloy containing all the 
elements of the planet. Then, in an 
instant, the bottom collapsed and the 
ring around it erupted and splashed 
molten elements high into the air in 
waves, boils, columns, spirals, and it 
all froze there. It remained forever, 
polished, reflecting every shade and 
color, some of it too bright to look 
at. 

From the Mouth the Gutu mined 
splinters with which they made their 
weapons. And to the Mouth they had 
led the 551st in the first year of 
battle. The warriors united. Every 
man had come, bringing all his tro- 
phies and weapons and his boys to 
carry his extra spears. The 551st had 
found them dancing and shrieking, 
singing a frantic ululation— the Gutu 
exultation over war. And to get to 
them the 551st had been forced to 
descend the few treacherous trails in 
column, with the nation of giants 
wild and surging at their flanks. 



CIRCLE OF FLIES 



131 




The Mouth had filled up with 
slaughter, bodies dumped on bodies, 
and the living stood on the stacks of 
dead in frantic defiance. After seven- 
teen years all the bones had finally 
been carried away.

R obinson steered the tractor 
over a ridge, and began a violent 
joggle to the valley floor. Fourteen 
troop carriers, a single tank and two 
scout cars were pulled into a circle 
below. Mount Misery sat to the 
north. It hulked above the terrain 
like a hunchback. Sharp ridgelines 
radiated from the base of the moun- 
tain. The night camp lay in a sandy 
valley like glistening toys between 
the mountain’s spread legs. A peaked 
shadow skimmed across the valley 
floor. As the sun sank the mountain 
sent its groundcast sniffing for blood. 

Robinson’s vehicle rolled into the 
circle and parked. The mountain 
provided an extra half-hour of semi- 
darkness, shade, the illusion of a 
break in the heat. The men spilled 
out of their vehicles. A mess crew 
erected a camp kitchen. A water 
barrel was rolled into the arena and 
Robinson went to it, marked the 
night’s ration on the glass measuring 
tube. The men were free to take 
what they wanted. Experience and 
the careful eyes of their fellows told 
them what was fair. 

The chief messman handed Finch 
a plate. “Better eat it before it gets 
too hot.” The messman guffawed. It 



was an old joke. Finch took the plate 
and watched Robinson stride around 
the perimeter, inspecting each vehicle 
inside and out. 

According to military custom, 
Robinson was the last served. Other 
officers ignored tradition, but Robin- 
son did not. The 551st maintained a 
schedule of strict discipline and 
Robinson considered it his discipline 
to keep up the morale of the men 
and to set an example. Robinson 
took his plate to a small circle where 
other officers were eating. He sat 
with them but just a Uttle apart and 
chewed quietly, efficiently, at his 
meal. When finished he dunked his 
own plate in the sterilizer vat and 
replaced it in the stacks. Then he 
moved out of sight. 

Delphinius stumbled in the gray of 
night. One trooper played lonesome 
songs on a mouth harp. The camp 
had grown quiet. He found the com- 
mander lying on his bedroll between 
two vehicles. Robinson held a slender 
inhaler, a gold tube containing a 
euphoric. 

“Sit down, Delphie. Have a sniff.” 

Delphinius accepted the inhaler. 
“Thanks, sir.” He drew the drugged 
vapor into one nostril. They were 
silent a long while. 

“You were right about the shakes 
today, Mr. Delphinius.” 

“Damned if I weren’t.” The 
warmth of the drug reached the 
chiefs brain and he sighed. The tense 
knots in his muscles slackened one 
by one. “Sir, when does a man know 
he’s up to the end of his hitch?” 



132 



GALAXY 




“Delphie, you and me could’ve 
gotten ourselves killed many times 
over the year. Seventeen and four- 
teen. That’s thirty-one years of noth- 
ing to live for. But we never did 
manage to die. A lot of men have. 
Maybe now seems like the time if 
you’ve quit having a reason to stay 
alive.” 

“Nope.” Delphinius wagged his 
head slowly. “I ain’t put up that 
way. It’s just the feelin’ I’ve got. I 
keep on dreamin’ right along.” The 
chief embraced his own meaty arms. 
“Things are just breakin’ up and I 
feel somehow the hitch is over— but I 
can’t really say.” He dirugged and 
stood up. 

Robinson lowered himself to his 
bedroll. “Maybe so. My dreams have 
been getting pretty thin. It’s the end 
of the line when you’ve got no hope 
and I can’t find any.” 

He shut his eyes and Delphinius 
moved away. 

O H, MAMA! Robinson gathered 
an image of his mother, a fat 
woman, Jamaican. She had bunched 
the youngest ones around her and 
left London for better parts. His old 
man had been drunk as ever, always 
dying and never managing to be 
dead. She had thought the oldest had 
already gone bad and had left him 
with his father so that neither would 
spoil the ones remaining. / wish 
you’d taken me, he thought. Life 
would have come out some way 
other than this. 



Robinson had gone to school 
sometimes, just to learn the mathe- 
matics. The cargo sailors at the 
docks— he had even talked to gold- 
braided officers, astrogators and 
pilots— had told them, “Boy, you 
want to go up there, you got to 
know the mathematics.” He did well 
when he studied. When his father 
disappeared, he kept their room by 
himself, and he kept up his thieving 
to pay for it. He whipped the lights 
out of a Kuzian, a Gif, some Terra 
Novans, any fool who walked away 
from the docks into Robinson’s 
dreary slum and looked like he might 
have money. In time he was even 
brilliant in his studies and one day 
Mr. Crutt suggested that if Robinson 
could learn to keep up attendance he 
would help the boy secure a grant to 
go to the university. He agreed. He 
had just one ambition. To fly in 
space. 

One of those periodic attacks of 
social conscience that grip aristocrats 
put him where no boy from his 
background dared dream of going. 
One day word simply came that 
there was a billet for a disadvantaged 
bright young man at the Galactic 
University in the Academy of Fleet 
Science— and the billet was his! 

He excelled. He was proud of his 
cadet whites, thirsted for the regular 
uniform, dreamed of standing on the 
bridge as an ensign, rising to become 
ship’s captain, the master. In his class 
of eight hundred, he always rated in 
the top five. Where he was weak he 
struggled until he did weU.

In the women’s cadet corps had 
been an unusual girl. She was the 
daughter of the great Nance Gershon, 
the industrialist. She was radiant, 
delectable, a joyful person. And she 
had ambition. Girls of her class did 
not follow careers. They were ex- 
pected to inherit, to become hos- 
tesses to the centers of power and to 
be brood mares to the dynasty. But 
Stella wanted, before she surrendered 
to that, to have a few years on the 
bridge herself. She met Robinson at 
the Mid-Year Ensemble in which the 
supplicant cadets were presented. 
Her betrothed. Cadet Throble, had 
been ill and she danced with Robin- 
son that night. They fell injudi- 
ciously into love. 

Stella’s family cowed before her 
will, inherited from her father. But 
they had been alarmed by the pro- 
posal that she not only marry be- 
neath her class but that she break an 
appropriate engagement to do it. 
Nevertheless, it was to be so. 

Except that Robinson had been so 
engrossed in his career that he had 
never noticed that between the other 
cadets— scions of patrician homes— 
wound a thick web of alliances. To 
them Robinson and the few like him 
were tolerable outsiders. When he 
courted one of their women he made 
enemies that stretched from the 
Academy deep into the fleet. Soon 
no cadet would share quarters with 
him. His membership in the Sailors’ 
Club was revoked. His test papers 
were lost or misgraded. His equip- 
ment was vandalized. 



Finally, frustrated, he confronted 
Thorble and Thorble called him out. 
It was permissible for cadets and for 
officers without assignments to fight 
duels. Every Terran cadet turned out 
on the parade field, row on row of 
white tunics, silent, certain of who 
the winner would be. And wondering 
what revenge would be meted out to 
him. Thorble fell with a gash in his 
thigh and his nose shattered by 
Robinson’s handguard. It took only a 
few seconds. 

The next day Robinson was 
awarded a commission and an im- 
mediate transfer to ground forces, 
with orders to report to the 551st 
Field Expeditionary Force, then in 
training. 

T he drug numbed him, and Rob- 
inson fell into a troubled sleep, 
bothered by heat, too weary to rest. 
He dreamed and the laughing girl 
stroked his cheek and her voice was 
rich and lustrous : Darling, you ’re so 
handsome in whites! Next he stood 
erect behind the helmsman, trem- 
bling, for the helmsman steered hope- 
lessly for the points of light, but one 
by one each went out and he cried. 
Sir! Are we lost? and he tried again 
and the light diminished into noth- 
ing: Sir! Are we going to die? But the 
last light guttered down and then 
flickered back to life and Robinson 
answered himself. No, we are just 
becalmed. 

Robinson jumped to his feet with- 
out knowing why. He heard gunfire, 
a carbine. He turned and looked out 



134 



GALAXY 




beyond the circle of vehicles. The 
Gutu were massed and running in, 
hundreds of them. He pulled- out his 
pistol and fired twice into the heart 
of the nearest one. Two replaced the 
fallen Gutu. They were quiet! Robin- 
son fired at both, tore their flesh, but 
they rushed into him, smashed his 
chest, and he felt himself hurled into 
deepest night . 

He awakened startled and turned 
his head. A shock went off in his 
neck and scorched a path up and 
down his spine. He held his head still 
and blinked. He was in a room of 
pink walls, constructed of form-a- 
foam. The walls were warped, irregu- 
lar. He heard someone murmur and 
slowly turned his head. A young 
Gutu leaned on the far wall, his 
sword in the floor, hands cupped 
over the pommel. Two females in 
white cloth skirts sat on the floor by 
the warrior’s feet. It was cool in the 
room. 

One female stood and peered at 
him, creeping closer. ‘'Subu h ’n!” she 
said and the other female jumped to 
her feet and passed through a drape 
that hung over the door. The warrior 
gazed dull-eyed, not able to compre- 
hend the activity around him. He 
stared into space. 

The females watered and fed Rob- 
inson and helped him to sit up. They 
were tall women, but they were 
young Gutu with firm breasts and 
soft plaits of hair. Robinson won- 
dered what it would be like to have 
one. No man had that he knew of. 
You could not rape a Gutu and the 



Directory seriously forbade any fra- 
ternizing, not that it had ever been 
possible. 

Robinson’s shoulder was broken. 
It had been set and wrapped. He 
thought he had a concussion. Dizzi- 
ness crowded him if he stood too 
long. The females steadied him and 
wiped his face with cool rags. He was 
treated to this tender therapy for 
hours. No one spoke. The girls passed 
in and out and the guard kept his 
vigil solemnly. 

At last one of the females entered 
and said, “Joo— come— mmm— me.” 
Both females helped him walk. He 
felt like a child between them. They 
helped him through the drapes and 
he suppressed a gasp. 

The remnants of the 551st were 
scattered before him. Over a hundred 
men, many wounded and injured— 
these had been bandaged and splint- 
ed. Gutu females moved among the 
men, serving food and drink, tending 
to the hurt. Silent warriors lined the 
walls. He saw Delphinius, arm brok- 
en, cheeks slashed. The chief smiled 
and raised a hand in salute. Four 
Vupeculans huddled at the chief’s 
feet. Brope was stretched out beside 
them asleep on a pallet. 

They were all in a deep cave, a 
chill dank place, lighted by stolen 
lamps. Water dripped from the walls 
and coursed through grooves in the 
stone floor. Form-a-foam cells had 
been constructed along the cavern 
walls. Robinson always wondered 
how the Gutu used half the things 
they stole. 



CIRCLE OF FLIES 



135 




The females guided him to a side 
grotto, away from the main cavern 
and to the door of a form-a-foam 
cell. One girl pointed for him to go 
in. Dizziness washed over him. He 
lurched and went through the door. 

H e was in a room with a huge 
desk. The desk had been in- 
tended for Commodore Tsu, but the 
Gutu had stolen it seven years earlier 
in a raid on the cargo platform south 
of Lake Serenity. It was of genuine 
Sirenian diieldwood and cost a for- 
tune. On shelves behind the desk 
were bound volumes, tapes and a 
tape reader. Gutu spears and swords 
were placed along the walls. On one 
wall was an original portrait of a 
Synch maiden in mating frock. On 
the others were star charts, a photo 
of The Siren and beside it a photo of 
Zetha, the view from the north pole. 

The Gutu behind the desk was 
named Dak. Thirteen years earlier six 
reasonably bright Gutu had been 
selected to go offworld to school. 
That had been a cool period, during 
which the miners and the Directory 
stifled their ambitions. The Confede- 
racy had sent cultural enrichment 
agents to Zetha for a short while. 
Dak, one of the six, had gone off to 
school at Beta Amanda. No one had 
since figured out what became of the 
educated Gutu. 

Dak was pointing to a chair before 
his desk. “Please sit. Commander.” 
Robinson slid into the chair and 
put his head down for a moment. 



Nausea tugged at him. Dizziness and 
fear threatened to make him sick. 
Finally he raised his head. Dak was 
studying him, leaning forward on the 
desk. He wore a green robe and 
several necklaces. Robinson became 
aware that he was wearing only his 
undergarments. 

The Gutu had a superstitious re- 
gard for the few among them who 
were actually intelligent. These per- 
formed the magic of reasoning with 
alacrity and were frequently obeyed 
out of awe. 

“How are you, Dak?” Robinson 
asked. He straightened himself, strug- 
gled to compose his emotions. 

“I am very well, Commander. It is 
pleasing to see you are alive. It was 
not known at any time that you 
would survive, of course.” Dak 
poured brandy into two exquisite 
pink crystal goblets. Robinson had 
lost them in a raid on the officers’ 
warehouse. He could no longer re- 
member when. 

“Fattening the kill. Dak?” Robin- 
son took the glass of brandy. 

“Only as a manner of speech. 
Commander.” 

“I’d like to know what is going on. 
My men—” 

“You have seen your men? Then 
you know they are in good care. 
Those who survived. There were 
casualties.” 

“What about all our equipment?” 

“That unfortunately will mostly 
have to be destroyed. What is useful 
will be kept. It will take some time.” 
Dak raised his glass. “I would like to

toast, as your people do, a noble 
enemy.” 

R obinson acknowledged and sip- 
ped his brandy. He drained the 
glass. The brandy heated his throat 
and he sucked in air to refresh his 
mouth. “How long have you been 
around. Dak?” 

“For many years now. I returned 
at night with cargo and slipped away. 
It was impolite of me, but the sailors 
had been good enough to let me 
know that any Gutu was shot at first 
sight. I thought to avoid the social 
amenities. 

“I think you will appreciate. Com- 
mander, that this has been carefully 
planned. We plotted your habits. 
You have simple habits for fighting 
simple people. We know your favor- 
ite campsites. We know you have 
become uncareful with your guards. 
And we had to guide our men to 
make them fight a different way. It is 
harder to teach them new habits than 
it is for your men to learn them.” 
“I’m impressed,” said Robinson. 
“Listen, D^, let’s get to the point. 
The Gutu have never tortured 
people. Why didn’t you just overrun 
us? You’ve always been straightfor- 
ward killers in the past.” 

“Yes, straightforward.” Dak’s bulk 
was slightly ludicrous behind the 
desk. When he straightened he loom- 
ed up behind it, reducing its scale 
and importance. He sensed this and 
leaned forward again. “You have not 
been tortured, I think.” 

“No.” 



“You will not be— and I will ex- 
plain. But first I ask you to tell me 
one thing, to answer a question. Why 
have you stayed to fight us so long. 
Commander? Do you hate us so 
much? You have become part of our 
very lives.” 

Robinson thought, looking into 
his goblet. “I had to get my crystal- 
ware back,” he murmured. 

Dak turned an ear toward him. 
“What is that?” 

“Nothing.” He looked into Dak’s 
eyes. “No, I don’t hate you people. 
Dak. I’ve been here because I had no 
choice. I had to do it to survive.” 

D ak nodded vigorously, satisfied. 

“Good. Then we understand. 
None of us had any choice. It is 
necessary to survive, yes? And you 
will see that when I went off to 
school it was to find a way for my 
people to survive.” 

“Why the hell did you come home 
then? This place is going to blow up 
any minute. Your people can’t see 
that, but you can. And there’s been 
this-” 

“This killing. Commander? You?” 
“Yes, me and killing.” 

“You would have killed me if you 
had found me. I knew this. But I 
knew as well that you could be our 
survival. I have had to learn to think 
in many new ways. In unusual ways. 
Here.” Dak reached behind him and 
picked up a volume. It was stamped 
LIBRARY COPY. He handed it to 
Robinson. “It is volume eight of The 
Comparative History and Study of

Structures and Genetic Affinities of 
the Anthropomorphic Species of 
Peoples, by Professor Marg Thqir. 
Are you familiar with Thqir?” 

“No. He’s a biologist of some 
kind?” 

“Thqir, yes. I’m surprised you do 
not know of him. He pioneered in 
the study of the humanoid life 
forms. Let me explain. He observed 
that certain forms are repeated in 
the universe. Thqir was a humanoid 
himself, a Vupeculan, in fact. He 
traveled to over a hundred worlds. 
He had many students who assisted 
his study. He wondered if there were 
common genetic pools or if adapta- 
tion to form were predictable under 
given circumstances—” 

‘That’s all academic to me. Dak.” 

“Of course. I was in the library at 
the university, feeling very sad be- 
cause I could think of nothing to 
help my people. They are hard 
people to deal with. They are not 
only conservative, they are too 
stupid to be anything else. They are a 
difficult people to save. 

“So I found that book and started 
to thumb through it to see if my 
people were mentioned. I looked 
them up under the genetic tables— 
the genotype and also the affinity 
genotypes. Do you see it? Good, The 
list at the bottom of the column 
indicates the species with which the 
Gutu ought successfully be able to 
breed.” 

Robinson peered at the page. He 
recognized the symbols for what in 
Anglic-Terran is called Homo Sapiens 



Sapiens. Robinson chuckled and 
handed the book back to Dak. 

“So what?’ 

“Indeed, Commander. Do you not 
see why you are alive?” 

“You want me and my men to 
breed with your people?” 

“Exactly. That is it.” 

“Dak, Dak, be a realist.” Robinson 
shook his head. A tired grin gripped 
his mouth. “Your people breed and 
what does it get you? More babies to 
feed to the guns? Oh, I realize what 
you’re after. More intelligent off- 
spring. So they’ll be a little harder to 
kill— is that it? Dak, this world is 
going to blow up. They’re going to 
sit out there and kill you until it 
happens. They’re fools. They love 
that metal and that money. They’ll 
ride this world to death to get it. The 
road has run out, man, for you and 
your people and for me and my 
men.” 

D ak listened calmly. He spread his 
hands on the desk. “Commander, 
more intelligent offspring they will 
be, no doubt. But also they will have 
hearty constitutions. Look at the 
Gutu physically. Look at the adapta- 
tions we are capable of. We are a 
powerful people.” 

“But, Dak, you cannot beat them 
out there— no matter how strong you 
are. And what’s the point? There’s 
nothing to save. The world’s going to 
fly-” 

“You keep saying that, Command- 
er. But perhaps not for a thousand 
years. Yes, yes, but perhaps to- 



138

morrow. I know this. But there are 
other worlds, better worlds than 
Zetha by far.” 

“How do you get to them?” 
“Commander, think for one 
moment. You are tired. You have 
lost belief! There are not many Gutu ' 
left. It is a good thing because 
without our animals we would only 
have starved these many years any- 
way. But suppose that we had a 
population of brighter children. Now 
with that and the rights to what they 
want here so badly, the minerals, the 
ores— and they are ours by right—” 
Dak slapped the desk— “we would 
have something. Your people make 
bQlions from us, do they not? If we 
could have the revenues from that 
for just one year— but we’ve not a 
visigull, not a fobber!” 

Robinson pursed his lips. “Even 
without wealth, perhaps—” 

“Perhaps what?” 

“Mercenaries. Your people are hell 
lo fight. Discipline them, get a smart- 
er generation together, a little more 
nip and tuck—” 

“Now you begin to think. Com- 
mander! That is excellent.” Dak 
looked at him for a moment and 
then said, “I make this proposition 
on behalf of my people. Those of 
you who will agree to this— to father 
the children and to teach them— will 
live out your lives in peace.’ 

“And the alternative?’ 

“Painless death.” 

Robinson held out his crystal and 
Dak refilled it with brandy. “My 
hitch seems to be over.” 



“What is that?” 

“Nothing. You know. Dak, I’ve 
kept myself alive so that I could live 
my life. Does that make sense?” 

“To me, very much.” 

“Then I agree— if you guarantee 
that every one of my men will be 
treated well.” 

“Some are not useful, not Ter- 
ran-” 

“Those are the ones I mean most 
of all.” 

“Ah! Well! It is done. Com- 
mander. A toast?” They drank their 
glasses down and Robinson stood up. 

“I will make an announcement to 
my men in a few hours. I’d like to 
rest now and I want the guard out of 
my room.” 

Dak nodded, smiling, and rushed 
out of the room. Robinson felt his 
way into the cavern and looked for 
his cell. One of the females spied him 
and came to take his arm. The men 
watched the sagging body of their 
commander being taken to his bed 
and they worried. 

The warrior was gone. The room 
was cool. The girl put water to his 
lips and helped him to lie down. Her 
hands, fretful and tender, touched 
his many wounds, and Robinson 
stared into the girl’s eyes. He realized 
that Dak must have selected some of 
the brighter girls to consort with 
him. 

He reached up and ran his fingers 
over her flat smooth cheeks. “You 
must be mine, h’m? Well, come on, 
lie down here. Let’s take a little 
rest.” ★

AND BABY MAKES THREE 

WILLIAM J. EARLS 



T hey bought the baby because 
Elain said she’d go crazy if she 
didn’t have something. 

“This is the best we have,” the 
salesman said. He showed them the 
super deluxe model. Turned off, it 
looked like a life-size doll— blond 
hair, blue eyes and pudgy arms and 
legs. “It cries, wets, drinks. It’s pro- 
gramed to sit up by itself, roll over. 



put things in its mouth. It can stand 
up holding onto furniture. It will 
even teethe and grow two inches in 
the next six months— and it sleeps 
twelve or more hours a day.” 

The salesman put in the power 
pack and flicked the tiny button 
behind the right ear. The doll kicked 
in its crib, lifted its head and looked 
around. 



140 



“Oh, Jim, he’s beautiful,” Elain 
said. She reached over and the baby 
put out his hand, closed it over her 
finger and squeezed. She blinked 
hard, smiled, and the baby smiled 
back. “May I pick him up?” 

“Of course.” 

She buried her nose in the baby’s 
neck and nuzzled it as the tiny legs 
kicked excitedly. The baby laughed. 
She held it close and its fingers 
touched her face. 

“Can we buy him, Jim?” She 
looked at him, her eyes soft and 
hungry. She stayed home all day 
with nothing to do. She’d had gold- 
fish once, then a kitten, then a 
puppy. The goldfish had died— prob- 
ably from overfeeding— and the kit- 
ten and puppy had grown too fast, 
become independent animals too 
quickly, not the soft, cuddly things 
she had fallen in love with. The 
robobaby looked as though it might 
work— it was soft and cuddly, would 
grow slowly— and the best thing was 
that it could be thrown away when 
she became bored with it. 

“All of the pleasures of a real 
baby, none of the pain,” the sales- 
man said. “Venerri circuits through- 
out its body. People who don’t know 
will think you have a real baby.” He 
dropped his voice. “Have you ever 
seen your wife so happy, sir?” 

Elain was holding the baby, walk- 
ing around the store with it, showing 
it the reflections in the mirrors, 
cooing to it, rocking it in her arms, 
her eyes warm and misty. 

“We’ll take it,” Jim said. 



“It needs rest, of course,” the 
salesman said. Jim nodded. The Ve- 
nerri circuits, which could be pro- 
gramed for anything— including 
memory, compassion and even day- 
dreams— needed at least one hour of 
inactivity in three. Everyone had 
seen an overworked robo— and they 
were everywhere, doing everything— 
suddenly collapse when the Venerris 
burned out. “It’s smaller, so that it 
needs even more rest.” 

Jim was amazed at the cost. “Be- 
cause of the programs,” the salesman 
explained. “You can set it to sleep 
through the night if you want— it 
never needs a baby sitter. Shut it off 
when you leave the house. It can 
even be programed for sickness— if 
you want to practice before having a 
real baby.” 

“We’re not planning on it,” Jim 
said. 

O N THE way home Elain kept 
smiling at it, looking down at it 
in her arms, laughing when it smiled 
back at her. 

“We have to think of a name,” she 
said. 

“You think of it. It’s your toy.” 
“It’s not a toy, Jim. Look.” She 
whistled between her teeth and the 
baby waved its arms and laughed. 
“It’s a baby, Jim, and it’s ours. 
Ours.” 

While she fixed dinner the doll 
played on the floor of the living 
room, lifting itself onto the coffee 
table and chairs, drooling onto the 
carpet. While they ate she fed it milk

from the bottle that had come with 
it. 

During the evening, while he work- 
ed on papers he had brought home 
from the office, she played with the 
baby, then put it to sleep in the extra 
bedroom. It awoke once during the 
night. Jim got up— ordinarily he was 
a very sound sleeper— when Elain 
didn’t, went into the baby’s room 
and shut it off. He heard her in the 
morning. 

“The baby!” she screamed. “The 
baby!” He ran from the table to her 
and saw her looking down at the 
lifeless doll. “It’s dead, Jim. It’s 
dead.” She was terror-stricken, ashen 
and shaking. 

“No it’s not.” He reached over, 
found the small button and flicked it 
on. The baby kicked, smiled and 
looked up at him. “It cried in the 
middle of the night,” he said. “You 
know I need my sleep.” 

“Don’t ever do that again.” She 
lifted the baby, held it close and 
cooed to it. 

When he came home the spare 
bedroom had been turned into a 
nursery. There was new paper on the 
walls, a crib and a bassinette and a 
dresser full of baby clothes. Elain 
was sitting on the floor, watching the 
baby play with new toys. 

“You said I could,” Elain said 
when she saw him looking at the 
paper and calculating its cost. 

“I did.” He crossed to the picture 
window and looked down at the 
harbor. “Are drinks ready?” It was a 
ritual that they each have two drinks 



in front of the window when he 
came home from work. The baby 
started to cry almost as soon as he 
sat down. Elain picked him up, but 
he kept crying. 

“What’s wrong with that— thing?” 
Jim said. 

“I don’t know. He may be teeth- 
ing. There— there— ” she said softly. 
She stood up and went into the 
nursery. Jim waited for her and, 
when she didn’t come back, followed 
her. She was sitting in a chair holding 
the baby, trying to feed it. There was 
a dirty diaper on the floor and Jim 
wrinkled his nose in disgust. 

“They do that, too?” he said. She 
glared at him, indicating that the 
baby was going to sleep, and asked 
him to leave the room. 

H e went back to the picture 
window and slumped into a chair 
waiting for her. When she came out 
the drinks had turned to juniper- 
smelling water in the pitcher. 

“I didn’t think it would take that 
long,” she said. “He’s teething, I 
think.” 

“Teething—” 

“Babies are like that. They teethe, 
they make messes— but they’re so 
lovable. Oh, Jim—” 

“It’s a doll— a robot,” he said, 
harder than he had to. 

“No— don’t say that. Think of 
it as a person.” She bit her lower lip, 
blinked hard. “I want a baby— some- 
one to love— so much. It’s a baby. It 
has to be.” She looked away from 
him.

“It’s not.” 

“Please, Jim. Say it’s a baby. You 
don’t know what it’s like, being 
home all day with nothing to do.” 

“You had the goldfish, the 
puppy.” 

“The goldfish.” She almost laugh- 
ed. “They died. I overfed them, 
remember?” From the nursery came 
sound— they could hear the baby cry 
for an instant in its sleep. “I need 
this, Jim.” 

He looked at her, so tiny, so alone. 
“Okay,” he said. She reached out her 
hand, took his and they sat in front 
of the window for five minutes until 
the baby cried. 

The baby awoke during dinner, 
too. Elain fed it at the table, holding 
the bottle with her chin, the baby 
cradled in her left arm as she ate. 

“I really think he’s teething,” she 
said. When dinner was over, Jim 
found the instruction book that had 
come with the baby and read it while 
she rocked the child and crooned to 
it. 

“What kind of a program is the 
baby on ?” he asked when she had 
tucked it in for the night. 

“The one he was on when we— got 
him,” she said. She looked defensive. 
“Why?” 

“I just wonder if he should be 
awake as much as he is.” 

“He’s teething,” she said. 

“Isn’t he supposed to sleep twelve 
hours a day?” 

“All babies are different,” she 
said. Tlie baby woke once during the 
night and she left the bed to tend it. 



He rolled over, angry at being awak- 
ened. 

Elain was feeding the baby in the 
new high chair when Jim came into 
the kitchen. She smiled at him, then 
fixed his breakfast— though he had 
told her many times he didn’t need 
it— as the baby played with its cereal. 
When he called home at noon he 
could hear the baby in the back- 
ground as he talked to her. When he 
came home the baby was in the 
playpen and Elain was watching it. 
She fixed drinks and they sat in front 
of the window while the baby cooed 
and gurgled behind them. 

“Isn’t he beautiful?” Elain said. 
He nodded, knowing it would please 
her. “Do you think Byron is a good 
name?” 

“Byron?” 

“For the baby.” 

“Fine.” 

“I mean— do you really like it?” 
“Yes.” He reached to touch her 
face and she kissed the palm of his 
hand. The baby started to cry. 

E lain sent out birth announce- 
ments, called a christening service 
and arranged for a short ceremony. 
On a shopping trip with the baby she 
signed up for a photography gim- 
mick-one picture a week for a year. 
She joined a Young Mothers Club. 
She told Jim that she was happier 
than she had ever been before and he 
believed her— she smiled more now, 
laughed more often and seemed like 
a young girl again. 



AND BABY MAKES THREE 



143 




She was also more tired than she 
had been before. Byron woke up 
once or twice a night and seemed to 
be awake all day, but that didn’t 
seem to bother her. She had never 
been an intellectual— in spite of her 
college education— and holding the 
baby, taking care of it, sacrificing for 
it, seemed to fill a need in her that 
had not been hinted at before. She 
had always been lonely, she said, but 
he had never guessed at the depth of 
her need to be with someone. 

It was all Byron now. He would 
wake in the middle of the night and 
Elain would go to him, feed him and 
rock him back to sleep. He crawled 
on the floor, drooling onto the car- 
pet and destroying magazines. He 
wet himself often, threw up onto 
Jim’s best shirt one afternoon when 
he held the child at Elain’s insistence. 
Elain didn’t want drinks in the after- 
noon any more— she forgot to make 
them several times, rarely finished 
the one she made for herself— al- 
though it was she who had begun the 
custom, as she had begun most of 
their rituals that made them differ- 
ent, she said, from all the other 
people who had ever lived. The baby 
was there constantly, demanding to 
be held or changed or fed, having to 
be lifted away from dirt, breakables 
and electrical outlets. 

“I don’t think the baby should be 
awake all the time,” he said. 

“It’s just healthy, that’s all. We 
wouldn’t want a sick baby, would 
we?” 

When he looked again for the 



instruction book he found the thing 
more tattered and torn than he had 
expected it to be. He knew that she 
had been using it often. 

“Have you been changing the pro- 
gram?” he asked, knowing that she 
had, knowing that she was doing 
something to keep the baby awake 
and active. 

“Look how healthy he is,” she 
said instead of answering. She lifted 
Byron and touched his mouth. “He 
has a tooth already. You can feel it.” 
She made Jim run his finger over the 
baby’s gums. He could feel a tooth 
under the softness. 

“It’s a tooth,” he said. 

“You don’t sound very impressed. 
Don’t you care?” 

“I care, about you.” 

“You should care about the baby, 
too.” She turned her back on him. 
He looked at the instruction book in 
his hand and decided to call the 
salesman. 

4 4 I ’’ WELVE hours of rest are 
X mandatory .for that ma- 
chine,” the salesman said. “You’ve 
seen that it— uh— digests?” 

“Too well.” 

“That’s a special formula. When 
the machine is resting, either turned 
off completely or just when the child 
is sleeping, the chemicals actually 
rebuild and strengthen the circuits.” 
“In other words, she’s really feed- 
ing it?” 

“It only needs one or two feedings 
a week. Most of the rest is wasted, 
but the owners like to think they

have a real baby. Many feed them 
four times a day. They feel mother- 
ly— and it’s good for them.”. 

“It’s the lack of rest that bothers 

.-,.55 

me. 

“The machine has to be rested.” 
The salesman looked down for a 
moment. “She likes the doll quite a 
bit?” 

“Yes.” 

“Some young mothers are over- 
zealous at first. The doll is made for 
about a week of overuse.” 

“We’ve had it three.” 

“You’ve never had a baby be- 
fore?” 

“No. We had a puppy once. Gold- 
fish. She overfed them.” 

“Some women do that. They love 
too much.” The salesman shook his 
head slowly. “You’ll have to make 
her understand.” 

Elain wouldn’t understand. “It’s 
because he’s so healthy that he’s 
awake so often,” she said. 

“He’s only awake because you 
keep him awake.” 

“I need him.” She picked Byron 
up and held him close. 

“It’s not good for him to be awake 
so much.” 

“You’re just jealous,” she said. “I 
need someone to love, that’s all. You 
have your job and you can’t love me 
the way Byron can. I thought you 
could, but it’s impossible. I need 
him, Jim.” 

“Okay,” he said. He knew she had 
never been so content and he listened 
while she told him what Byron had 
done— climbed onto the coffee table. 



drank from a cup, played peek-a-boo. 
She had taken him shopping and 
people had told her what a nice baby 
she had. 

44 ^ drink?’ 

TT she asked. He nodded; it 
was the first time in five days she had 
asked. She put the baby onto the 
floor and put ice cubes into the 
pitcher, splashed some vermouth on 
top of them. Byron started to cry. 

“I think he needs a change,” 
Elain said. “Will you add the gin, 
dear?” She ran into the nursery with 
Byron in her arms. Jim crossed to the 
window. Down below he could see a 
freighter being pushed upriver by 
tugs, a barge loaded with garbage 
going the other way. He poured gin 
onto the ice cubes and stirred. 

Elain came from the baby’s room 
before he had poured the drinks. She 
put Byron on the floor near his 
newest toy. He laughed and clutched 
at it. She came over to Jim, kissed 
him and held out her glass. He 
poured her drink. They clinked glas- 
ses and sipped. 

“You do understand?” she asked. 

“Of course,” he said slowly. 

“Isn’t he beautiful?” Elain looked 
at the baby. It was standing at the 
coffee table, holding the top with 
pudgy hands, reaching for the maga- 
zines just out of reach. Elain smiled, 
said “Hi, baby,” and the child turned 
to her and beat his hands on the 
table in excitement. 

“He is beautiful,” Jim said. “Did 
he rest today?” 



AND BABY MAKES THREE 



145 




“A little,” she said. Which prob- 
ably meant not at all. Byron had 
been awake at seven in the morning, 
had been awake when Jim called 
home at eleven and Elain had taken 
him shopping in the afternoon. It 
was now past five. Ten hours. And it 
would be awake until about nine. It 
would then awaken at least once 
during the night. About eight hours 
of sleep— and supposedly it needed 
twelve. 

They were both watching Byron 
when he fell. One moment he was 
standing, holding onto the table, and 
then he tipped to one side, thumped 
onto the floor and lay there not 
moving. 

Elain dropped her glass and ran to 
the baby, skidding to a stop on her 
knees beside it. She lifted it and 
looked into its dull eyes. It was 
breathing and tried to smile back, 
but the mouth was crooked and the 
look was pitiful. 

“Jim. It’s— sick.” 

“Easy, dear.” He kneeled beside 
her and looked at the doll in her 
arms. Funny how much it looked 
like a doll now. The hair was false 
and too thick, the color in the cheeks 
too red. It was stiff, hard— not th:e 
way a real baby would feel— as 
though it had already been made up 
by a mortician. It kicked convul- 
sively and . 

“It’s dead. It’s dead!” Elain 
screamed. She held the doll in her 
arms and rocked back and forth with 
it, moaning, “My baby, my baby.” 

“Easy, dear. Easy,” he said, think- 



ing of the money it had cost, of the 
furnishings and accessories they had 
purchased. 

“I want my baby,” she moaned. “I 
want my baby.” 

“It will be all right,” he said. “We 
can do other things, go on vaca- 
tion-” 

“My baby.” 

“There are other babies. We’ll get 
one.” 

“I want this one.” 

He took a deep breath, lifted her 
tear-stained face in his hand and 
looked at her. It had never occurred 
to him until now that she was not 
pretty. 

“It’s not a baby,” he said. “It is a 
doll. A toy. It was never alive— and it* 
can never be dead.” 

“It was my baby.” She was angry 
now. “I loved it.” 

“I love you.” 

“Don’t you care about the baby?” 

“It isn’t a baby.” 

“It is!” She fell against his chest, 
the limp doll in one arm, sobbing. 
When she stopped shaking, he put his 
hands on her shoulders and looked at 
her. He lifted her hand and put it to 
his mouth, kissed the tips of her 
fingers and the palm of her hand. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. He watched 
her blink away tears. 

“You don’t care,” she said. “I 
thought you would, but you don’t.” 
The hand she had on his face reached 
behind him and shut him off. He fell 
heavily onto his side and she sat on 
the floor, holding the baby in her 
arms, weeping softly. ★

passionate observation. It is a little 
wearying to read this kind of shriek; 
surely the truth stitches in and out of 
both their fabrics and will emerge in 
its good time. 

Ursula K. leGuin’s The Lathe of 
Heaven (Avon, 95o:) is out in a 
handsome paperback. If you haven’t 
read it, you’re impoverished; enrich 
yourself. Lester del Rey’s welcome 
collection, Gods and Golems, con- 
tains my very favorite sf story, For/ 
am a Jealous People-, rereading it 
after all these years, I still think so, 
doubled. Another welcome collec- 
tion is A Pride of Monsters by James 
H. Schmitz. (Collier, $1.25) which 
includes Greenface—l think, his very 
first published story— and The Pork 
Chop Tree, and three other good 
ones. A nice package. 

I’m going to steal a little space 
here to tell you about something 
Wina and I are into. It’s hard to say 
just when it began— each of us, long 
before we met, had worried away at 
the basic thinking, but it was Wina 
who really made it happen. Without 
being faddists or back-to-nature 
freaks we’ve started to grow various 
kinds of sprouts right in the kitchen, 
at about lU a pound (vs. $2.00 in 
the supermarket) and we’ve started 
to raise rabbits, which give us high- 
quality meat for 14— 16<t a pound, 
plus pelts which we are accumulating 



toward a bedspread and jackets. We 
bake our own bread— lots of it— and 
use it to barter with: two loaves for a 
brake job on the VW, for example- 
half a bushel of prime avocados for 
three. In a garden no bigger than a 
large living room we have herbs and 
spices and medicinal plants and the 
usual array of salad greens— and last 
year we had bmssels sprouts, broc- 
coli, com, beets, carrots and Swiss 
chard to give away. Meanwhile Wina 
has become an expert on roadside 
plants, many of which are edible or 
therapeutic. The more we do the 
more we learn. For example, you 
don’t even have to have land. A 
bucket of soil and 45 invested in 
sets will give a family tomatoes all 
summer long, grown indoors. We are 
not Cassandras crying catastrophe, 
but I had a kind of vision one day; 
Wina and I standing at the window 
looking down at the next street. 
About eight doors down, a house was 
afire. We were waiting for the sound 
of the sirens— and after a few minutes 
I turned to her and said: “They’re 
not coming.” End vision . but if 
something happens, something that 
makes our money no good at the 
store, or if suddenly there’s no store, 
well, we will not, like many people, 
be at the mercy of the present 
contents of our stomachs. We’ll 
know what to do, what to find, 
where to go, whom to take with us. 

Think about it. Think hard.

can stand. It’s the lack of informa- 
tion that’s bugging me. Just what am 
I supposed to be excited about?” 

“The old king’s answers,” said 
Andersen, turning his attention back 
to the scoutship’s controls. His 
enigmatic perverseness carried an un- 
explained edge. Clearly he, too, had 
feelings about this particular mission. 

Chad Hartzman, the third member 
of the survey team, looked up from 
the navigation console. 

“If you won’t tell her, Robin, I 
suppose I must. It’s like this. Seemly. 
A storm blew up in the Federation 
Council when Space Survey refused 
clearance for the colonization of the 
planet, Loric Four. A quorum of the 
council contested the decision on the 
grounds that Space Survey hadn’t 
filed sufficient evidence to show why 
Loric was unsuited for human habita- 
tion. Fortunately the survey commis- 
sioner refused to move on the point 
and managed to force a postpone- 
ment. Then he collared Robin and 
myself, told us to acquire you regard- 
less of expense and get the hell out 
to Loric for some answers he could 
use on the council rostrum.” 

“But if he’s made a case for 
refusing clearance, he must already 
have his answers,” said Seemly rea- 
sonably. Her dark eyes were questing 
and alert. Stray wisps of hair had 
already crept back over her forehead. 

Robin Andersen returned to the 



conversation. “He may have the ans- 
wers, but he hasn’t told us what they 
are. At a guess, the material is either 
untenable or not particularly con- 
vincing. I’d presume that only the 
reputation of the official Resident on 
Loric has prevented the commission- 
er from being overruled. So our 
mandate’s to make an independent 
assessment of Loric and report 
back.” 

“If we have to reestablish all the 
base data,” said Seemly, “it could be 
a very long job. Why can’t we merely 
reexamine the work that’s already 
been done?” 

“There’s nothing against that. But 
if the Resident’s gone off on a 
tangent we must be careful not to 
follow him. There’s no point in an 
independent investigation if it’s going 
to start from premises that may or 
may not be false.” 

“But I still don’t see why it was 
necessary to drag me back from 
tutorial leave. Surely this assignment 
could have been handled by a routine 
survey team?” 

“It isn’t a routine assignment. 
We’ve been handpicked to solve the 
commissioner’s dilemma. You’re one 
of his big guns. Seemly. He’s pitting 
you against the old king— and he’s 
obviously prepared for a fight. Who- 
ever has to bring down the old king is 
going to need all the standing of 
Professor Seemly Vivian.” 

“I refuse to be used as a sort of 
academic battering ram,” she said 
severely. “I’ll make up my own mind 
as to whom I depose and for what

reason. How much to we know about 
Loric Four?” 

Chad slid the abstracts across the 
table. “There’s nothing very special 
about it. According to the manual, 
it’s a fair candidate for colonization. 
All the critical parameters are center- 
ed around Earth-norm and no major 
hazard areas are indicated. There’s a 
blanket protection order covering the 
indigenous fauna, but that still leaves 
considerable scope for adaptive colo- 
nization.” 

“So where’s the problem?” 
“Darned if I know. The Resident’s 
had a ship down there for a couple of 
years and seems to have survived 
quite happily. Nothing in our records 
suggests die place is unsuitable for 
human habitation.” 

“It can’t be as simple as that.” 
“There are a couple of oddities on 
the books. Two of the survey ships 
making field contact with the Resi- 
dent crashed on their subsequent 
takeoffs from Loric.” 

“You mean survey trips like this 
one? Two ships out of how many 
total?” 

“Just those two,” said Chad. “I’d 
hoped you wouldn’t ask.” 

“And is there anything else about 
this trip that you’re being too damn 
nice to tell me?” 

“Not really— except that the only 
other woman ever to set foot on 
Loric ended her life by jumping off a 
cliff.” 

“I knew there had to be some 
good reason why I couldn’t get my 
hands on the paperwork,” she said 



seriously and went off to the galley 
in search of coffee. 

T hree days later the little survey 
scoutship made orbit around 
Loric Four. Seemly had spent the 
intervening period reading and re- 
reading everything that had an even 
remote connection with the planet. 
Now she acquired the optical bay 
and spent several hours with the big 
telescope while Andersen and Hartz- 
man made the preliminary instru- 
mental analyses. Finally she sought 
out Captain Andersen. 

“Tell me about the Resident down 
there, Robin.” 

“None other than the old king 
himself.” 

“Why do they call him the old 
king?” 

“I suppose it’s basically because 
his name’s Kohl— Peter Kohl— the 
grand old man of extraterrestrial 
exploration.” 

“I’ve read his books, but I didn’t 
get the impression he was old.” 

“Not in years, perhaps. But in 
terms of experience he’s seen and 
achieved more than most of us could 
in several lifetimes. So whichever 
way you look at it, I guess the title’s 
apt. He’s the old king.” 

“And we’re supposed to make an 
independent assessment of a space 
territory he’s been working on for 
two years. It doesn’t make sense.” 

“It does if you assume the old 
king’s answers were the kind nobody 
wanted to hear. I think that’s the 
point of sending you out here, Seem-

ly. You’ve the status to depose hint if 
you disagree. But if you happen to 
concur, then not a damn soul in the 
universe is qualified to argue with the 
pair of you. The commissioner has 
hedged his bets most carefully.” 
“Mm! I’ll sort out the commission- 
er later. How does a Resident func- 
tion in a situation like this? Is he 
alone down there?” 

“No. As Resident, he’d have a 
small naval garrison. A ship and 
about twenty men to handle security 
and routine, so that he’s free to carry 
out any research he chooses. Under 
Space Law the planet is legally his 
until the Federation Council replaces 
him by another Resident or by a 
structural colony. At the same time 
he’s the custodian of the planet on 
the Federation’s behalf. Presumably 
he has to answer some hard questions 
if he lets it slip out from under him.” 
“I thought you were being 
serious.” 

“I was. The point I was leading up 
to was that he’d be well within his 
rights to refuse us permission to land. 
If he tells us to go away again, there’s 
not a thing we can do about it.” 

“Is it likely?” 

“No. But I can imagine his feeling 
slighted at having his conclusions 
questioned. So we’ll need to treat 
him with a little tact and a little due 
respect. Please don’t antagonize him. 
Seemly.” 

“I don’t know what you mean.” 
“You know exactly what I mean. 
I’ve seen you completely dismantle 
men. But I doubt if you’re a match 



for the old king. Start getting tough 
with him and you’ll probably get 
your little academic hide tanned 
where it hurts the most.” 

I ANDING permission having been 
igranted, Andersen put the scout- 
ship accurately down on the landing 
pad. While the area cooled he and 
Chad Hartzman carefully donned 
dress uniform in preparation to meet 
the Resident. Once the formalities 
were over, they would relax and 
become themselves again, but proto- 
col decreed that first contact be 
conducted with full ceremony. Seem- 
ly, trim in her green Space Survey 
uniform, had not attended a Resi- 
dent’s reception before and was 
slightly apprehensive. 

A smart escort of naval ratings 
came to conduct them to the Resi- 
dent’s ship. In front of the ship, 
under a white awning erected es- 
pecially for the occasion. Seemly had 
her first glimpse of Old King Kohl. 
Whfle Andersen presented their cre- 
dentials and made formal introduc- 
tions she could only stare at the 
imposing giant of a man who sat bare 
to the waist on an upturned crate 
and rumbled through his beard in a 
voice like thunder. Protocol, it seem- 
ed, made no demands on the appear- 
ance or conduct of Residents them- 
selves. 

The old king’s hide was nutbrown, 
tanned and ripened by exposure to a 
dozen alien suns. Beneath his close- 
cropped hair, which had been pre- 
maturely bleached to strands of plati-

num, blue eyes peered out, constant- 
ly inquiring and amused. The leath- 
ery face was alive with comprehen- 
sion and concern. His frame was 
large, yet with loose and wiry limbs. 

He stood up suddenly to empha- 
size some point and she found her 
eye level disconcertingly in the 
middle of the grizzled mat .of hair 
that covered his mighty chest. 

Later she returned discreetly to 
Chad’s side. 

“He’s big,” she whispered. 

“Big in every way. Seemly. 
Robin’s not at all keen on being sent 
to reexamine Kohl’s work. And as far 
as I’m concerned he’s the king and 
we’re the fiddlers three.” 

“Is he married?” 

“Once was. His wife was Marion 
Matteau, the exo-biologist. She was 
with him here on Loric before she 
died.” 

“Died?” 

“She’s the one I mentioned. She 
apparently threw herself over a cliff. 
Not a shred of a reason why. Must 
have been quite a blow to him. She 
was quite a remarkable woman.” 

“He’s pretty remarkable himself, if 
you ask me.” 

Robin Andersen beckoned them 
back to where he and the Resident 
were engaged in conversation. 

“I’ve been explaining to Doctor 
Kohl the purpose of our visit. It 
appears he hadn’t been informed of 
the Federation Council’s opposition. 
Were there any points you wished to 
take up at this stage. Seemly?” 

Seemly found the old king’s eyes 



watching her shrewdly. She turned to 
face him, wondering what was pass- 
ing through his mind and suddenly 
feeling the need to justify her posi- 
tion. 

“I’ve been trying to understand 
your reasons for refusing coloniza- 
tion, Doctor Kohl. As far as our 
reports go, your stand is untenable. 
The climate and the soil are fully 
compatible with Earth’s agriculture 
and many of the native plants are 
edible. Admittedly there are a few 
large predators about, excluding 
some creatures described as bears, 
but nothing a well-defended colony 
couldn’t handle. The air’s good and 
the water’s good and the manuals 
don’t give a single hint of anything 
that might support your refusal.” 

“My reasons aren’t written into 
the manuals. Professor Vivian. Not. 
yet.” 

“Then they can’t be very manifest. 

I know the responsibilities of a Resi- 
dent tend to induce excessive cau- 
tion. But you must see there’s a 
realistic balance between potential 
dangers to the colony and Earth’s 
crying need for living space.” 

“That’s only part of a Resident’s 
responsibility,” said the old king 
gently. “Under Space Conventions 
he’s also to consider the effects of 
colonization on the planet’s indige- 
nous population. Specifically, no 
planet may be colonized if such an 
act might prove detrimental to any 
indigenous species considered to be 
in evolutionary ascent with a possible 
potential approaching that of man.” 



152 



GALAXY 




“Which condition doesn’t appear 
to apply to any of the species so far 
recorded in the Lxjric indices.” 

“Well, since you’ve been given the 
mandate to make an independent 
assessment I’ll leave you to form 
your own conclusions— after you’ve 
had a chance to investigate. If you 
want to discuss anything you’ll find 
me available. Copies of my reports to 
the commissioner are also yours for 
the asking. But I’d prefer you first to 
form your own conclusions, then 
check your findings against mine. 
That way I can’t be accused of 
subjecting you to bias.” 

“We couldn’t ask for fairer than 
that,” said Andersen hastily, taking 
Seemly firmly by the arm. “I appre- 
ciate the way you’re taking this. 
Doctor Kohl. It can’t be easy for a 
Resident to accept that his work 
needs to be reexamined.” 

“I don’t accept that it needs to be 
reexamined. I merely accept that my 
findings don’t sit too easily in the 
soft guts of the commissioner’s of- 
fice. Your reevaluation can only 
strengthen my hand.” 

“Assuming we agree,” said Seemly 
pointedly. 

“Oh, you’ll agree, my dear. You 
may make a few false starts, but if 
you’re the type of person your repu- 
tation suggests, then I shan’t have 
lost a cause but gained an ally.” 

II 

44T STILL can’t put a finger on 
Awhat’s missing,” Chad 



said some ten days later. “The larger 
predators are dangerous but controll- 
able. The smaller omnivores cover a 
wide spectrum, but only the things 
called bears have any dominance— 
and that may be only a regional 
phenomenon. The true herbivores are 
fleet of foot and only as intelligent as 
you’d expect from their low position 
in the food chain. There are no 
reptiles worth talking about— and 
though insects are plentiful, some 
sort of hornet appears to be the 
worst hazard. Haven’t you come up 
with anything, Robin?” 

“Afraid not. Radioactivity mar- 
ginal. Ultraviolet is a little high, but 
not beyond Terran tropical levels. 
Cosmic radiation is low. The primary 
distribution of elements approxi- 
mates that of Earth, though the 
allotropic forms suggest a different 
and more recent thermal history for 
Loric. As far as my work is concern- 
ed— this is a good place to come for a 
holiday. What about your pitch. 
Seemly?” 

“I’ve been checking the interreac- 
tion between the indigenous re- 
sources and the human animal. The 
garrison doctor’s done a very 
thorough job of recording the prog- 
ress of every sting, cut or infection 
suffered by the Resident’s staff over 
the past two years.” 

“And?” 

“Nothing showed up. No poisons 
or allergies that didn’t respond to 
treatment and no infectious diseases 
outside the range of human expecta- 
tion. In short. I’d expect to be safer 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS

here than in many places on Earth’s 
equator.” 

“Which,” said Chad, “brings us 
neatly back to the point that we 
can’t even discern the area in which 
Kohl’s objections lie.” 

“I’ve been thinking about that,” 
said Seemly. “About the two space 
crashes— which may or may not be 
relevant— and particularly about the 
death of his wife. Apparently she 
went off one day to a canyon about 
two kilometers east and walked 
straight over the edge. An hour ear- 
lier she had been in the company of 
Kohl and other members of the 
garrison, who all testified that she’d 
been quite normal and very enthu- 
siastic about the progress of her 
work.” 

“Could her death have been an 
accident— one Kohl has rationalized 
to place the blame on some local 
influence?” 

“It’s possible, though I’d have 
judged him to be a more balanced 
character than that. But in the ab- 
sence of a more definite lead. I’d like 
to look at the idea more closely.” 

“Well, I’m in agreement,” said 
Andersen. “As a matter of fact I’ve 
already been out to the canyon. It’s 
called the glass canyon and is a 
fabulous sight. If you feel like going 
there this afternoon I’ll show you the 
way.” 

“You won’t mind if I tag along?” 
asked Chad. “I was going in that 
direction anyway. I want to lay some 
cameras along the bear tracks. The 
most intelligent creatures I’ve found 



on Loric are the bears. I’ve a feeling 
they merit a bit of extra study.” 
“That’s interesting,” said Seemly. 
“Because that’s substantially what 
Marion Kohl nee Matteau was saying 
shortly before she went over the 
cliff.” 

B eyond the fringes of the forest 
they came to the glass canyon. 
As Anderson had promised, it was a 
fascinating place. During some 
struggle of truly amazing geological 
forces the land had literally been 
torn apart and a vast fissure had been 
formed -a canyon nearly a kilometer 
across and a quarter of a kilometer 
deep— a canyon more brilliant and 
beautiful than anything they could 
have imagined. 

The fissure was a vision of wonder- 
land. The deep bedrock of mainly 
glasslike silicates had been fractured 
along cleavage lines and crystal boun- 
daries and age-old prisms of nearly 
flawless crystal glass stood tens of 
meters high, like the stockroom of a 
manufacturer making chandeliers for 
giants. The powdered frit had fallen 
to the floor of the canyon, there to 
receive a carpet of forest loam wash- 
ed down by the occasional storms— 
and on it flourished lush vegetation. 
Through the grasses and shrubs the 
bears had worn paths of pure en- 
chantment down to the crystal sand. 

The real wonder of the place, 
however, was the crystal bridge. A 
vast hexagonal prism leaned out from 
the foot of the forest to span a full 
half kilometer of the canyon’s head. 



154 



GALAXY 




To conjecture that it had been placed 
as a bridge to provide a path across 
the great gulf in the land was easy— 
certainly it was widely used as a 
bridge by the bears and other ani- 
mals, as many paths leading to its 
extremities testified. 

To cross its glasslike length over 
the deep brilliance of the canyon was 
an experience to daunt all but the 
most experienced climbers. The com- 
plete absence of hand- or foot-holds, 
the unbroken exposure to the oc- 
casional gusts of wind and the pro- 
found sense of vertigo such an ex- 
posed and transparent situation 
could produce, bred a sensation so 
alien to human instinct that Seemly, 
for one, at first refused to do more 
than lie down on the spar and peer 
breathlessly into the crystal depths. 

For the rest of the afternoon she 
and Andersen helped Chad set his 
cameras and instruments along the 
bear paths and never mentioned the 
exo-biologist whose death had 
brought Seemly to this site. She had 
already decided for herself that won- 
der alone could bring a person to this 
spot— and accidents were a continu- 
ing possibility in an unknown envi- 
ronment. She forgot about the whole 
incident until, while leading the 
party on its return that evening, she 
came across the old king standing in 
the path. 

H e was wearing a loose tropical 
jacket, partly unbuttoned. From 
its open front the head of an infant 
bear poked inquisitively. 



“Professor Vivian— what a pleasant 
surprise!” Kohl seemed genuinely 
pleased to see her. “How’s the inves- 
tigation going?” 

“Not too well at the moment,” 
said Seemly. She waited for Ander- 
sen and Hartzman to cafdh up. 
“Frankly we can’t find a thing to 
worry about.” 

“You will. If you want a hint on 
where to look— the problem has to 
do with the bears.” He reached into 
his jacket, extracted the small crea- 
ture and held it gently in his arms. 
“This one was Marion’s pet. Un- 
wittingly it caused her death. Cute 
little rascal, isn’t he?” 

“He doesn’t look dangerous.” 
“Butter wouldn’t melt in his 
mouth. But he was an accessory 
before the fact of her demise as 
surely as some of his kin caused the 
loss of two survey scoutships.” 

“That charge would need quite a 
bit of substantiation.” 

“Oh, I can prove it all right. But I 
rather hoped you’d do it for me.” 
Seemly stroked the little crea- 
ture’s head with her finger. 

“I don’t suppose you’d consider 
letting me have it, would you— as a 
pet?” 

The old king rumbled into his 
beard; “In the circumstances I 
couldn’t take the risk. Even if you 
weren’t the cleverest, you’d still be 
the most charming person on Loric. 
We can’t afford to lose you.” 

“I’m not superstitious, you 
know.” 

“Neither am I, Professor Vivian.” 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



155 




“Call me Seemly.” 

“Delighted! But as I was about to 
say, it wasn’t superstition that killed 
Marion. It was a force more logical 
and compelling than any magic.” 

“Well, what do you make of it?” 
she asked the others when Kohl had 
continued on his way. 

“He could be rationalizing along 
the lines we discussed e^lier,” said 
Chad. “After all, what can a small 
bear do except bite you or transmit 
some infectious disease?” 

“Which we know from the garri- 
son medical records, didn’t happen,” 
said Seemly. 

“It tends to confirm our suspi- 
cions that the bears are important, 
though.” Andersen was thoughtful. 
“Whether Kohl has a phobia about 
them or whether they do constitute 
some form of danger remains to be 
proven. But Kohl seems convinced, 
so I vote we concentrate our atten- 
tion on bears for a while. Pity he 
wouldn’t let you have that one for a 
starter. Seemly.” 

“And there’s an odd thing about 
that, Robin. Because I don’t know 
why I asked him for it. I’ve never 
been a great one for pets. But just for 
a moment I really had a feeling for 
that little one.” 

“Frustrated maternal instinct,” 
commented Chad. “Next thing you 
know, die’ll be going broody on us. 
Captain.” 

S OME time after midnight Seemly 
awoke in her cabin and turned on 



the lights. The notes on which she 
had been working were still on the 
open flap of the desk. Shaking the 
sleep from her head, she sat on the 
corner of the bunk and leafed 
through the papers, as though seek- 
ing in them a key to something not 
yet written. 

Rubbing her forehead to try to 
stimulate some thought that refused 
to come, she shrugged off her night- 
wear, donned her working coveralls 
and went out to the galley to make 
coffee. The discussions of the day 
still lingered in her mind and she 
knew that, for a while at least, sleep 
would be impossible for her. She felt 
certain she was on the verge of a 
breakthrough of some importance, 
but the elements of the idea refused 
to come together. 

Exasperating! 

Coffee made, she sat abstractedly, 
not really relishing the bitterness of 
the particular brand with which the 
ship had been provided. Then, realiz- 
ing she was wasting time when she 
could be doing something with it, she 
picked up her field kit and went 
outside. 

Loric had no moon, but the light 
from the bright Rim stars was ample 
compensation. Against the blackness 
of a cloudless sky the firmament was 
aglow with an aerial brilliance inde- 
scribably richer than the starlight of 
Earth. Seemly found she could easily 
discern the paleness of the track 
against the darker foliage— and even 
when she entered the confines of the 
forest there was still sufficient light 



156 



GALAXY 




to supplement her memory of the 
way. 

Soon her eyes adapted to the 
dimness and she was able to walk 
faster, possessed now by the cer- 
tainty that she was on the trail of 
something really significant. The ori- 
gin of her feeling was not too clear, 
but intuition had been her guide 
through many a trial in the past. It 
was certainly puUing for her now. 

She came to the crystal bridge 
sooner than she had expected, and 
marveled at how short the walk had 
seemed. Her destination lay on the 
other side of the glass canyon and 
the bridge shone before her under 
the bright stars like a shaft of light 
frozen into crystal immobility. It was 
curious, she reflected, how much 
easier it was to walk across the spar 
without the distraction of being able 
to see the depths of the canyon 
below. She recalled her foolishness 
earlier when, at one point during the 
afternoon, site had set a foot on the 
bridge and nearly fainted from ver- 
tigo. 

The far side of the canyon wall 
presented a difficult climb up a 
rockfall. Fortunately the bears had 
compacted little footholds and runs 
of steps, which helped somewhat. 
Finally she gained a firm bear track, 
which, though sloping upward at a 
disconcerting angle, proved relatively 
safe. She broke several fingernails 
during the ascent, but at last emerged 
triumphantly over the crest and rest- 
ed for a while on a damp and grassy 
bank. 



F rom there on the going was 
easier. A clear track led across 
the grassy slopes into a continuation 
of the forest. Seemly sighed with 
relief as she labored up the final bank 
and eagerly entered the trees beyond. 
Here the foliage was denser and the 
starlight filtering through the 
branches was barely sufficient to 
show her where to place her feet. 
Time and again she blundered into 
small bushes and only regained the 
path by a series of fortuitous acci- 
dents. By now her enthusiasm was 
burning at fever pitch and the trials 
of the journey only made the final 
prize more desirable and more worth 
the effort. She could not restrain 
herself from hurrying. 

Then shock! She stepped forward 
and fell into an unseen depression 
heavily disguised by the darkness. 
She avoided hurting herself in the 
fall— she seemed to have landed in a 
peaty bowl— but her tribulation made 
her suddenly aware of herself and the 
alien situation into which she had 
stumbled. Her sudden apprehension 
became a chilling bolt of fear. A 
rustle of movement around her made 
her shockingly conscious that she 
was not alone. Panic rose high in her 
throat as she strove to come to grips 
with the instant nightmare into 
which she had awoken. 

Creatures were moving all around 
her. Whether a few or several dozen, 
it was impossible to tell, but there 
were certainly a great number. Not 
knowing how many only added to 
her terror. From the hint of starlight

occasionally reflected in bulbous 
eyes she became convinced she had 
fallen into a covert of bears. How- 
ever, the most complete damage to 
her equilibrium was a realization that 
the impulse that had fetched her here 
was devoid of a rational basis. Like a 
drunk who wakes on a strange floor, 
she had only the vaguest recollection 
of her motives for coming— and felt a 
dreadful certainty that her situation 
would have been untenable by day- 
light logic. 

A sick dream had become a fright- 
ening reality. 

Something brushed her hand in 
the darkness and she screamed. It 
came upon her suddenly that the 
bears were omnivorous— preferen- 
tially carnivorous— and that she was 
unarmed and hopelessly outnumber- 
ed. She had occasionally seen car- 
casses of large animals torn apart by 
the bears. A gruesome observation 
remained in her mind— the bears 
never picked a carcass clean. They 
tore only the meat they wanted and 
left the scavenging to ants and eaters 
of carrion. The observation made her 
retch with fright. 

Her field kit was in a strong case 
of hide, heavy with the bottles and 
instruments it contained. She slipped 
it from her shoulder and, holding it 
by the strap, struck about her, her 
panic increasing with every swing. 
She could tell by the little patches of 
starlight reflected in their eyes that 
the bears had closed a circle around 
her, but they were nimble enough to 
avoid her flailing box. However, it 



needed only one to make the first 
move. As soon as sh? felt the claws 
and sharp teeth in her flesh, she 
would have to concentrate on that. 
While her attention was thus divert- 
ed, the rest of them would spring. 
Powerful jaws would strip her flesh 
away from the bone even as she 
fell . 

Seemly knew that her only chance 
was to make the decisive move first. 
If she could force a passage through 
to the pathway she might have an 
opportunity to run. Seeing a slight 
patch of a lighter color at the edge of 
the bowl, die moved in that direc- 
tion, her box still flailing on all sides. 
Then, thinking only of flight, she ran 
full-tilt at what she judged to be a 
break in the circle of bears. 

There were no bears there— only 
bushes. Her field kit became entan- 
gled in the branches and was torn 
from her grasp as she cannoned off a 
springy sapling. She caught her foot 
under a root and toppled back into 
the peaty bowl. As she stopped 
rolling, the circle of bears closed 
around her again. An overwhelming 
terror trapped her limbs like leaden 
weights. Screaming with a force suffi- 
cient to burst her lungs, she could 
only look up into the small circles of 
reflected alien starlight. Finally even 
her screams were inhibited to a whis- 
per. Hysterical fear gripped her and, 
hypnotized by the bright and bul- 
bous eyes of the circling beasts, she 
hugged herself against the dirt, whim- 
pered and gave up all hope of sur- 
vival.

S HE had no idea of how long she 
remained like this. Gradually she 
became aware of a lessening of ten- 
sion and dared to ask herself why she 
had not been attacked and killed. A 
noise up on the side of the bowl 
made her shrink with a new fear— 
which changed immediately into a 
pathetic cry of relief. 

“Peter! Peter— I’m here!” 
“Seemly?” Peter Kohl’s voice was 
surprised and anxious. A powerful 
handlamp played down upon her. 
“What the hell are you doing out 
here?” 

The question was rhetorical. He 
did not even wait for an answer. The 
handlamp played around the edges of 
the bowl and probed the surrounding 
foliage. All the bears had gone. After 
scouting the area for a few minutes, 
Peter Kohl came back. 

“Are you hurt?” 

“Not much. Only what I did to 
myself. The bears—” 

“On Loric it’s always the bears,” 
he said comprehendingly. “Did they 
attack you?” She heard the whip of 
leather as he drew his weapon from 
its holster. 

“No— I— ” She was weak and dis- 
traught and propped herself on her 
elbow with difficulty. “They just all 
came around and looked at me with 
those eyes. I tried to beat them off 
with my case, but I lost it. And then 
I got frightened— it wasn’t just ordi- 
nary fright. I couldn’t even move—” 
“I know, I know,” he said, as 
though her explanation were suffi- 
cient. He returned his weapon to his 



belt. “They’ve gone now anyway. 
Let’s see about getting you back.” 

Seemly rose unsteadily to her feet 
and began to brush the clinging peat 
from her coverall. She was still 
trembling in uncontrollable spasms 
and instinctively sought the support 
of Kohl’s arm. The look of serious- 
ness on his face spoke volumes, but 
for the moment his attitude was 
purely one of concern. When she 
stumbled on a root he rumbled like a 
giant, swung her over his shoulder 
and carried her along the path with- 
out appearing to notice her weight at 
all. 

When they came to the rockfaU 
above the crystal bridge he set her 
down gently. 

“I’ll go down first— you follow. 
Don’t be surprised if you feel me 
guide your foot to a hold. Whatever 
you do, don’t panic. I’ll break your 
fall if you slip.” 

Once started on the downward 
climb. Seemly was dismayed to find 
how difficult it was. The hazards of 
the descent contrasted so greatly 
with her memory of the outward 
journey that at first she considered 
Kohl had chosen a more dangerous 
route. It was only when they reached 
the head of the crystal bridge and she 
looked up that she realized that her 
recollection had played tricks on her. 
It was now obvious that for an 
inexperienced person to have climb- 
ed the broken face in darkness was 
tantamount to a suicide attempt. 
Kohl saw the expression on her face 
as she looked back up the treacher- 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS

ous barrier, but if he had any com- 
ment he kept it to himself. 

This left the problem of crossing 
the crystal bridge itself. As before, 
the glassy straightness of the spar was 
plain under the dim light, but now 
the blackness of the canyon was a 
compelling magnet that threatened 
to draw her off the featureless sur- 
face and destroy her in the depths 
below. She took two steps before her 
courage deserted her. Turning back, 
she sat shaking on a crystal outcrop. 

“It’s no good, Peter. I can’t do it. I 
haven’t got the nerve.” 

“You crossed it earlier— and 
alone,” be said reasonably. 

“Earlier I was—” she searched ur- 
gently for the word she needed— 
“possessed? Does that make sense?” 
Kohl nodded. “It does to me. But 
I can’t leave you here and you won’t 
find the crossing easier in daylight. 
So there’s only one thing for it.” 

He bent down, swung her across 
his shoulder again and immediately 
started across the crystal bridge. 
Seemly shut her eyes, gripped the 
folds of his jacket and prayed that 
sudden panic would not cause her to 
kick and disturb his balance. After 
what seemed a lifetime a change in 
the sound of his footsteps told her 
that they were safely on the farther 
bank. Once more he set her down, 
but this time his face was stern and a 
little angry. He strode ahead down 
the bear tracks without a further 
word. She followed meekly, not dar- 
ing to let him get too far ahead. 

When they reached the ship. 



Robin Andersen was standing in the 
lock, searching the night with curious 
eyes. He gave a little gasp when Kohl 
came into view, followed by Seemly,, 
pale and distraught. 

“Doctor Kohl— what happened? Is 
she all right?” 

“I found, her in a bear covert on 
the other side of the glass canyon. 
Give her a sedative and make her get 
straight to bed. She should sleep off 
the worst of the effects. In the 
future. Captain Andersen, I’ll thank 
you to maintain an electronic lock- 
watch at night. It serves a double 
purpose on Loric— not only does it 
warn you if something’s approaching, 
it also cautions you when some- 
body’s going out. I take it you didn’t 
know Professor Vivian had left?” 

“No. I assumed she was asleep in 
her cabin.” 

“I’ll require you to give me a full 
report on this affair tomorrow. I 
don’t expect to have to wet-nurse a 
supposedly competent survey team.” 

Andersen was about to contest the 
point, then saw the look of gravity 
on Kohl’s face. Instead he threw a 
brief salute. If Kohl insisted on a 
lockwatch, he presumably had his 
reasons. 

After all, it was his kingdom. 

Ill 

A ndersen called the team to- 
Lgether in the operations room 
late the next morning. Seemly, al- 
though tired and depressed, appeared 
to have suffered no lasting ill effects 



160

from her experience. Realizing this 
was to be an official inquiry into her 
actions, she had dressed in her best 
uniform and now sat nervously on 
the edge of her seat and looked 
remarkably unhappy. 

“The Resident wants to ’see me in 
an hour’s time,” said Andersen. “As 
you know, he found Seemly on the 
far side of the crystal bridge during 
the night, scared half out of her wits. 
Knowing her as I do. I’ve no doubt 
she had a good reason for going out 
there alone. But it wasn’t very wise 
and it wasn’t according to standing 
orders. Technically we’re out on a 
limb, and the Resident could order 
us off-planet because of it. Therefore 
I have to hold a formal inquiry and 
produce a few good answers.” 

“I’d prefer to discuss my part first 
with you in private,” Seemly said. 

“Normally I’d be only too happy 
to oblige. But going out there at 
night was so far out of character for 
you that there must have been a 
pretty powerful factor at work. 
Something as powerful, perhaps, as 
the influence that took Kohl’s wife 
over the edge of the crystal canyon. 
If there are any of these factors 
around, the sooner we all know and 
can recognize them, the safer we’ll all 
be. Come on. Seemly— give.” 

Seemly’s brow furrowed as she 
concentrated on her answer. “It’s all 
very much like a bad dream. The 
truth is, I don’t really know why 1 
went out. I remember waking up and 
feeling certain I had something im- 
portant to do. Thinking about it now 



I’m sure the feeling of important 
came first and I went around looking 
for something to attach it to. I think 
I started with Chad’s cameras in 
mind, down by the crystal bridge. I 
know I was feeling quite interested 
and purposeful when I left the ship.” 
“And you weren’t frightened 
then?” asked Andersen carefully. 

“Not at all. Fear never occurred to 
me. The sky was so light I didn’t 
even bother with a handlamp. You 
see, I knew where I was going, and it 
seemed such a perfectly ordinary 
thing to do. I even walked the forest 
path in darkness as though I’d been 
doing it for years.” 

“But Chad’s cameras were all on 
this side of the canyon. You helped 
put them there yesterday. So what 
persuaded you to go across the 
bridge?’ 

“When I reached the bridge, I 
knew the important thing I had to do 
lay well on the other side. I crossed 
the bridge and even entered the 
second forest quite happily. It wasn’t 
until I fell into a group of them that 
I woke up and began to get scared.” 
“Them?’ 

“Bears. I fell among them in a sort 
of bowl. Suddenly they were all 
around me. Whichever way I looked I 
could see nothing but eyes. I thought 
they were going to attack, but they 
didn’t. I wonder now if they weren’t 
as frightened of me as I was of them. 
But at least they didn’t panic.” 

“Did you?” 

“Not at first, but then I really 
flipped. I attacked them with my 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



161 




field case and tried to run. I ran 
straight into a bush, tripped and 
tolled right back among them. They 
all crowded around and just looked 
at me. I remember nothing but eyes 
on all sides— eyes full of strange stars. 
And I was more terrified of them 
than I’ve ever felt in my whole life. I 
suppose I was screaming, because my 
throat’s still raw. But it wasn’t just 
ordinary fear. It was the sort of fear 
which breaks you out of a night- 
mare— the absolute fear which comes 
from somewhere deep inside you.” 

“What happened then?” 

“That’s it— finish. King Kohl came 
by and brought me home. He had to 
carry me across the crystal bridge 
because I didn’t have the nerve to 
make it on my own.” 

Chad Hartzman, who had been 
taking notes, looked up. 

“A couple of things don’t make 
sense to me. Seemly. First, I take 
Robin’s point that it’s utterly out of 
character for you to go out at night 
on your own. Weren’t you even 
slightly aware that this was an irra- 
tional act?” 

“No. I was certain that I had 
something to do. That’s not an un- 
usual experience for anyone. I didn’t 
bother to tell anyone, because it 
didn’t seem necessary. It’s the sort of 
decision one makes every hour of the 
day without even being conscious of 
it.” 

“So whatever influence took you 
out there was certainly insidious. 
Secondly, I’ve seen you in some 
pretty tough spots before. The one 



thing you don’t do when the pres- 
sure’s on, is to lie down and scream. 
Something got into you. Seemly, and 
it’s important we find out what.” 

“I wish I could tell you. All I 
know is that the fear was so intense 
that I was virtually paralyzed. Even if 
they’d attacked me, I don’t think I 
could’ve raised a finger in defense.” 
“Which again is untypical of you.” 
Chad looked at Andersen. “What do 
you think, Robin? Hypnosis? A drug 
of some sort?” 

“I don’t think it’s that simple.” 
Andersen had risen to his feet and 
turned to one of the viewports. He 
was looking out at the fringes of the 
forest. “I was standing at the lock 
when the old king brought Seemly 
back. I’ve just been asking myself 
why I was standing there when I 
should have been asleep.” 

“And did you get an answer?” 
“Yes.” Andersen turned back to 
face them. “The answer’s that I was 
trying to remember what was the 
interesting and important thing I had 
to do near the glass canyon.” 

“Telepathy?” asked Chad, astound- 
ed. 

“I honestly don’t know. I can’t 
explain it any more than can Seemly. 
But in case you’ve missed the 
point— what was it that took the old 
king to such an unlikely spot in the 
middle of the night?” 

AN HOUR later Andersen re- 
turned. He looked dazed. 

“Did he accept your report?” ask- 
ed Chad. 



162 



GALAXY 




“Accept it? He congratulated us 
on it. IThe old devil was delighted 
that we’d picked up the point that 
Seemly couldn’t distinguish her rea- 
sons for going out from any normal 
everyday decision. And he confirmed 
that the same influence prompted 
him to go out there. The difference 
was that he went deliberately to find 
out what was going on, taking a 
handlamp, a gun and enough ammu- 
nition to decimate the forest if neces- 
sary. He also alerted his garrison 
commander and told him where he 
was going— and why.” 

“I guess we still have a lot to 
learn,” said Chad ruefully. “Did he 
explain how it was that the same 
thought occurred to the three of 
you?” 

“No, but he knows. He just wants 
us to work it out for ourselves. He 
did add some information, though. 
The bears Seemly fell among were all 
females. Had they been males, she’d 
have been eaten alive. Also he show- 
ed me the off-going cargo lists for the 
two spacecraft that crashed after 
takeoff. Notably— both contained a 
pair of infant bears, destined for the 
Galactic Zoological Center.” 

“So what’s the answer?” asked 
Seemly at last. 

Andersen rubbed his brow. “Tele- 
pathy’s still the only hypothesis that 
fits all the facts. I think that what 
you. Kohl and to a lesser extent 
myself, experienced last night was 
some sort of empathy with the bears. 
Some instinct prompted the crea- 
tures to congregate on the far side of 



the crystal bridge. I don’t know what 
the call could mean to them in terms 
of their own social organization, but 
it’s clear they all heard it. And we 
heard it, too.” 

“Would that also explain the qual- 
ity of the fear I felt?” asked Seemly. 

“I think so. A simple feedback 
mechanism. You blundered into their 
party and scared the hell out of 
them. They broadcast their fear back 
to you.” 

“Which is all very tidy,” said 
Chad, “provided you accept that 
telepathy— especially telepathy be- 
tween different species— is even a 
remote possibility. I’m afraid I don’t 
accept it.” 

“Accept it or not, I don’t have a 
better answer right now. Something 
called those animals together. It 
could have been some instinctive 
homing urge, but it was highly spe- 
cific as to time and place. Then 
Seemly wakes up with a bug in her 
mind and makes for the same spot. 
Shortly the old king goes there, too. 
Some time later, knowing nothing of 
all this, I wake up with the same 
idea. There has to be some mechan- 
ism to explain all that.” 

“Granted— but telepathy—” said 
Chad doubtfully. “I admit you’ve 
stacked up a remarkable set of coin- 
cidences, but coincidences are all 
they need to be. I don’t know what 
made Seemly go out there, but for all 
I know, the old king walks there 
every night. As for you, Robin— we 
heard nothing about your call until 
the rest of the facts had been estab- 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



163 




lished. That leaves fair scope for 
suggestion to supplement whatever 
was missing from the scene.” 

“Let’s leave it there for now,” said 
Andersen. “We don’t have enough 
evidence to work on. There’s just one 
point that strikes me, though. Your 
resistance to the idea of telepathy 
tends to confirm the hypothesis. This 
could be exactly the reaction that 
has made the old king’s answers 
unacceptable to Survey Center.” 

S EEMLY thankfully exchanged 
her uniform again for a working 
coverall. She preferred the latter be- 
cause it was more comfortable and 
because it had a plentiful supply of 
pockets, of which she was eternally 
short. Her unruly hair, which had 
been tightly drawn under her uni- 
form cap, was released to find its 
usual position around her neck and 
over her forehead. This done, she felt 
again more like a woman and less like 
a symbol of the survey establish- 
ment. 

Having pointedly announced her 
destination both to Andersen and 
Chad Hartzman, she went straight to 
the part of the naval ship that served 
as the Resident’s office. Peter Kohl 
looked up from behind a pile of 
papers, this time appearing to be 
more of an academic and less of a 
barbarian. He was genuinely pleased 
to see her. 

“Seemly! Grab a chair and sit 
down. None the worse for last night’s 
experience, I hope.” 

“A bruised ego is about the 



worst,” she said. “I feel I owe you an 
apology. I caused you a great deal of 
trouble.” 

“Not half as much as if I hadn’t 
come along. I’ve a bad record for 
losing people. Perhaps you’ll change 
my luck. Is there anything I can do 
for you-or is this purely a social 
visit?” 

“I do have an ulterior motive. I’d 
like you to tell me something. Do 
you have any idea why so many 
bears were gathered in that one spot 
last night? Does it have any special 
significance for them?” 

“If 1 told you the complete ans- 
wer, you’d be as wise as 1 am. Which 
would spoil the object of your inde- 
pendent investigation. The circum- 
spect answer is that I’m certain the 
location has no great significance. 
Such bowls occur all over the forests. 
1 think the bears were holding a kind 
of party and its location was prear- 
ranged.” 

“Prearranged?” Seemly was doubt- 
ful. “You and I both responded to a 
‘call’ to go there. That suggests spon- 
taneity.” 

“It does no such thing,” said Kolil 
seriously. A ‘call’ is a product of a 
gathering, not the cause of its incep- 
tion. The function of a call may be 
to contact others who’ve missed the 
news, but there can’t be a substantial 
call until a sufficient number are 
gathered.” 

“Are you sure of that?” asked 
Seemly. 

“Completely sure. As soon as I 
receive a Call, I always go out and 



164 



GALAXY 




check. That’s why I went there last 
night.” 

“You realize the implications of 
what you’re saying? If the meeting 
were prearranged the fact would sug- 
gest the bears have the ability to 
make abstract communications at a 
reasonably high level. Frankly, they 
would need a developed language.” 
“Wliich they have— after a fashion. 
Verbally it doesn’t amount to much, 
but they’re great writers.” 

“Writers?” The tone of her voice 
indicated she considered he was jok- 
ing. Certainly his eyes were smiling, 
but with amusement because of her 
consternation rather than anything 
else. 

“You don’t believe they can 
write? I’ll prove it to you. It isn’t 
writing as we know it, but it’s a 
written message just the same. Do 
you have this afternoon to spare?” 
‘To see bears writing I’d have a 
week to spare.” 

“Good. Join me after lunch. With 
a bit of luck we’ll see an exercise in 
alien literature and possibly some 
literary appreciation.” 

“Wild— er— bears wouldn’t keep me 
away from it. I still think you’re 
pulling my leg.” 

“My dear Professor Vivian, you’re 
a charming companion, but I don’t 
underestimate your academic ability. 
If I promise to show you bears 
writing-that’s exactly what you’ll 
see. 

T hree hours later, on a ledge 
overlooking the crystalline can- 



yon, Seemly adjusted her binoculars 
to focus on the indicated point. A 
bear, one of the largest she had seen, 
came wandering along a path in the 
depths of the crevice. It cocked its 
head alertly as it rounded a bend in 
the track. 

“He knows we’re here,” said Kohl. 
“But I don’t think it’ll worry him. 
They aren’t at all shy. See what he 
does now.” 

The bear shook its head impatient- 
ly a few times, then rose to its hind 
legs before the slab of crystal Kohl 
had pointed out. 

“Watch closely.” 

The bear began to jab and pat at 
the slab with its paws, following no 
apparent order but gradually cover- 
ing most of the crystal with a scratch 
or a tap or a firm pad pressure. 
Completing the exercise after some 
twenty minutes, it dropped back to 
all fours and inspected the rock for a 
few moments. Then it ambled off in 
the direction it had been going. 

“What was all that in aid of?” 
asked Seemly. 

‘That was a bear, writing.” 

Seemly adjusted her binoculars 
more carefully. “But there’s nothing 
written there,” she objected. “He 
may have been doing no more than 
catching ants or sharpening his 
claws.” 

“Nevertheless he did write some- 
thing, even though we can’t see it,” 
said Kohl softly. “Now we must be 
patient and wait for the next bear to 
come along.” 

They had a long time to wait. 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



165 




Nearly an hour passed before a po- 
tential reader padded along the path. 
Even then the creature passed the 
spot and appeared to turn back only 
as an afterthought. Then, incredibly, 
it sat in front of the slab and gazed, 
its head rocking as it strove to follow 
whatever was written on the face. 

“I don’t believe it!” Seemly said. 
“He’s reading the damn thing as 
though it were a poster.” 

This creature’s departure was hur- 
ried. It almost ran from the scene, 
following the direction taken by the 
first bear. After a few minutes the 
episode was repeated, this time with 
a group of three bears who sat in 
comical unison gravely nodding their 
heads in front of the blank crystal 
surface. The three also left in a 
hurry, following the direction taken 
by the preceding two. Two more 
arrived a little later to study the slab. 

“Convinced?” Kohl asked. 

Seemly nodded. “Yes. But I 
wouldn’t have believed it if 1 hadn’t 
seen it with my own eyes. What’s the 
explanation?” 

“The bears have scent glands in 
the pads of their feet. I assume they 
evolved as trail markers to indicate 
whether a particular route was being 
taken in flight, pursuit of food or 
merely as an idle stroll. Such signals 
would have a strong survival value, 
and therefore favor natural selection, 
as would the development of an 
extremely sensitive nose.” 

“Chemical trail and domain mark- 
ers are pretty widespread in the 
animal kingdom throughout the 



galaxy,” said Seemly in agreement 

“The bears on Loric have taken 
the idea a step further. They’ve 
settled on the flat faces of the crystal 
rocks when they really want to leave 
a message for the world. Using 
chromatography. I’ve managed to 
identify three individual scent prod- 
ucts, all of them remarkably persis- 
tent. These are combined together on 
the crystal faces in an amazing spec- 
trum of complexity. In their scent- 
writing they have the capacity— 
though I’m not sure how much of it 
they utilize— to compress more bits 
of information in a given space than 
we humans can in our optical writ- 
ing.” 

“Then the bears don’t read it— 
they smell it?” 

“Precisely! But that’s a techni- 
cality. Sensory information, however 
derived, is still information. If you 
smell smoke, you don’t wait for 
somebody to diout ‘fire.’ The fact 
that we humans habitually exchange 
the bulk of our communications op- 
tically and verbally doesn’t preclude 
other species’ doing it differently.” 

“No argument about that,” Seem- 
ly said. “But I’ve a feeling you’ve not 
yet come to the point you wished to 
make.” 

“Then I’ll come to it now. 1 know 
of thirty-three of these reading sites 
in this one forest alone and there 
could be more. The other day we 
were discussing the responsibilities of 
a Resident. In all honesty, can you 
expect me to recommend coloniza- 
tion of a planet where the indigenous 



166 



GALAXY 




population publishes its own news- 
papers?” 

Seemly was silent for a long 
moment. 

“Could I examine the writing 
more closely?” she asked at’last. 

“Certainly. But I don’t think it’s 
worth the bother of climbing down 
into the canyon. There’s a nearer one 
through the forest. Come, I’ll show 
you.” 

A SINGLE bear-track led through 
the undergrowth at this point 
and she chose to follow the old king 
rather than take the lead. Patterned 
sunshine fell through the tracery of 
the overhanging branches and the 
forest air was sweet and warm and 
loud with the rasp of insects. Perhaps 
because of her recent conversation, 
she became aware of the multitude 
of individual scents of flower and 
fern which lingered in the soft air. 

“Did you ever think,” asked Kohl 
over his shoulder, “that even man has 
a remarkable memory for scents? 
Fragrances attach themselves to 
whole bundles of experience. A re- 
markably small trace of just the right 
odor can trigger a whole chain of 
recollections. You walk into a 
room— and suddenly you’re trans- 
ported years back to a scene where 
the essential essences were exactly 
the same. 1 sometimes wonder if a lot 
of our brain’s spare capacity wasn’t 
evolutionarily involved in scent mem- 
ory— for some reason we’ve allowed 
the sense to atrophy. It isn’t consid- 
ered civilized to go around sniffing at 



your neighbors. I’m sure the human 
race is the poorer for it.” 

“I know what you mean about the 
memories— I remember childhood 
Qiristmases by their smell. Puddings 
and spice and citrus, liqueurs and 
incense— all somehow synonymous 
with a child’s excitement. I also 
remember the smells of examination 
halls and places I’ve hated.” 

“A good observation. Unusual 
levels of stress, excitement or fear 
seem to heighten scene perception. 
At such moments we’re thrown back 
closer to the instincts of our animal 
ancestors, for whom good scent per- 
ception could mean the difference 
between life and death. It’s curious 
how much remains to be discovered 
about ourselves.” 

They emerged into a forest clear- 
ing at a point where many bear paths 
crossed. At one corner of the inter- 
section a huge prism of crystal pro- 
truded from the ground. From what 
Kohl had already told her. Seemly 
knew that the placing of the intersec- 
tion was no accident. The smooth, 
glasslike face of the prism had an 
important function— this was con- 
firmed by the fact that all the tracks 
merged deliberately to pass one par- 
ticular face. 

Seemly studied this face carefully. 
She had no way of knowing 
what sort of message might be im 
printed on it. Was it, as Kohl had 
suggested, a form of newspaper? Or 
was it an elementary signpost? Per- 
haps it was a list of local residents— 
or an indication of the best areas for

hunting. Perhaps even a record of 
visiting pilgrims. She stood before it, 
entranced and intrigued. 

The old king was watching her 
from a short distance, quite amused 
by her intense concentration. 

“I know what you’re thinking. 
Seemly. Will we one day discover a 
Rosetta stone that will unlock the 
mystery?” 

“Well— what do you think?” 

“I’m sure the key exists— some- 
where inside us. Sometimes when I’m 
looking at one of the crystals I get 
the strangest impressions— images of 
places I’ve never seen and recollec- 
tions of conversations I’m sure I’ve 
never had. I can’t tell if it’s imagina- 
tion or whether I’m being influenced 
by the imprint on the crystal face. 
My guess is that the scents trigger 
chains of unusual associations. 
They’d have the greatest meaning for 
those for whom the message has the 
greatest relevance. What you might 
read there could be different for 
everyone.” 

HAT about adaptive coloni- 
▼ Tzation?” Seemly asked. 
They started back along the edge 
of the forest toward the plateau 
where the ships stood separately on 
their pads. “Wouldn’t it work if it 
were made incumbent on the colo- 
nists to adapt to the special require- 
ments of the bears— rather than try 
to force Loric into a Terran mold?” 
“No. It could be disastrous either 
for the colonists or for the bears. 
Short-term, I suspect the bears would 



win. So far you’ve only seen the tip 
of the iceberg. The only way a 
Terran colony could survive on Loric 
would be by virtually eliminating the 
bears— and that, I hope and pray, is 
contrary to the Space Conventions.” 

“The bears will be safe under any 
circumstances,” Seemly declared. 
“You’ve made your point and my 
reports to Survey Center will support 
you. But the bears’ reading potential 
is only one factor to be considered. 
They could be evolutionary drop- 
outs. Terra couldn’t hold up coloni- 
zation for a species in evolutionary 
decline.” 

“It would take a thousand years of 
observation even to discover which 
way they were going, though my 
favorite bet is up. Their paws include 
an opposed thumb, which gives them 
the ability to use tools when they 
need to. They’ve a high order of 
intelligence and they’re able to re- 
cord and communicate complex 
ideas— which in itself means they 
must have developed powers of 
abstract visualization. In short, 
they’ve the potential to develop 
everything we mean by civilization, 
though it’s difficult to see what 
advantage they might gain by so 
doing. There’s no virtue in civiliza- 
tion unless it carries an enhanced 
survival value. Space travel and Coca 
Cola aren’t in themselves relevant 
criteria.” 

“I grant you that, but you still 
haven’t given me a good reason why 
you think human coexistence on 
Loric is impossible.”

“I have my reasons, Seemly. But 
they’ll have more force if you deduce 
them for yourself. I’ll give you one 
last clue— the bears and the humans 
are too damn much alike.” 

They were halfway across the pla- 
teau before Seemly found her tongue 
again. 

“Too much alike?” The phrase 
plainly worried her. 

“Certainly. There’s an interaction 
between the bears and the humans 
which neither can avoid. Captain 
Andersen has diagnosed the effect as 
telepathy. He’s absolutely wrong, but 
the strength of the effect is some- 
thing to which you can personally 
testify. All in all, you were lucky.” 
“I’m sorry,” said Seemly. 

“Soiry?” 

“Your wife wandered off in the 
same way, didn’t she? That was why 
she died.” 

“It was. In those days we still 
underestimated the potency of the 
effect. Even when the second contact 
team left we still hadn’t realized 
exactly what we were up against. I 
was still blundering around looking 
for something like telepathy to ex- 
plain the facts. It was only later I 
found the real answer.” 

“Then you know what caused the 
field-contact teams to crash?” 

“I’ve only been able to give a 
name to it these last few months. 
Both of the teams wanted to take 
bears back to the Galactic Zoological 
Center for further study. That’s per- 
missible under license, of course, but 
we all overlooked a vital point.’ 



“Which was?” 

“The interaction between bears 
and humans is compulsive even over 
a fairly long range. In the confines of 
a spacecraft the reaction of a pair of 
frightened bears produced a greater 
effect than the human crews could 
stand. The bears’ panic literally took 
command.” 

Seemly’s comprehension was 
swift. “The bears communicated 
their extreme fear to the crew, just as 
the bears in the bowl affected me?” 
“And probably the converse was 
also true. Try to imagine communi- 
cating to a bear the stresses of a 
space crew during liftoff. It’s anxi- 
eties would reinforce the natural 
apprehensions of the bear. In a small, 
closed system you arrive at total 
feedback with no damping mechan- 
ism. The intensity of fear spirals 
upward— and the inevitable result is a 
ship out of control.” 

“And you’re now able to give a 
name to the source of this inter- 
action? And it isn’t telepathy?’ 

“No, it isn’t telepathy. And the 
rest of the answer you must deter- 
mine for yourself.’ 



IV 

S EEMLY’S sleep was shattered by 
alarm bells screaming in her 
mind: Danger! Emergency! 

She was dressed and through the 
cabin door before she was fully 
awake. In the corridor she collided 
with Hartzman. 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



169 




“What’s the matter, Chad? What’s 
going on?” 

“I don’t know— but that damn 
siren woke me—” 

“What siren?” 

“The emergency—” 

“You’re dreaming, Chad. Survey 
ships don’t have emergency sirens. 
We’d better get Robin.” 

“He just passed me, headed for the 
fire bay.” 

“Let’s hope he doesn’t make it.” 
“Why?” 

“Survey ships don’t have fire bays. 
Our fire control’s all manual, re- 
member?” 

“But the emergency—’ 

“I don’t know what it is or where 
it is, but I know sure as hell there is 
one. You’d better get to the controls 
in case we need emergency liftoff. I’ll 
go look for Robin.” 

She went down into the hold. At 
the foot of the ladder she found 
Andersen heaving boxes into a cor- 
ner. 

“You’ve picked a rare time for 
taking inventory,” she said critically. 

“No joke, Seemly! Some criminal 
idiot’s loaded stores across the fire- 
bay hatch.” 

“Knock it off, Robin. There’s no 
fire bay on this ship. If you ever did 
get through that bulkhead you 
wouldn’t find a thing but engines. 
You’re dreaming of a spacer.” 

Appalled, he stopped and banged 
his head with his hand. “D’you 
know, you’re right! God— what a 
mistake to make in an emergency! I 
could lose my ticket for this.” 



“Chad’s gone up to the controls. I 
think we’d better get there first in 
case he tries an emergency liftoff. I 
doubt we’d survive it down here.” 

“He wouldn’t be so stupid—” 

“Robin, until I’ve had the chance 
to knock your silly heads together I 
wouldn’t certify either of you as 
rational!” 

Pausing only to assure herself that 
Andersen was following, she climbed 
back up the ladder. The captain 
overtook her in the corridor, grabbed 
her arm. 

“Seemly— what’s the emergency?” 

“I don’t know, but the sense is 
strong, and it’s getting stronger. I’ve 
a feeling of panic, a desire to run— 
but I don’t have a thing to attach it 
to.” 

“Telepathy,” said Andersen sud- 
denly. “It’s those bears again. Some- 
thing’s happening to them, and it’s 
their fear we’re feeling. Something to 
do with fire. That’s it! There has to 
be a fire.” 

Seconds later they entered the 
control room. Chad was methodical- 
ly going through the takeoff prepara- 
tions. Through the viewports at least 
part of the answers became apparent. 
Against the vivid darkness of the 
Loric night, a great tide of flame was 
visible, stretched broadly across the 
horizon. A vast fire was eating its 
way through the forest adjacent to 
the spaceport. 

Andersen began estimating the 
danger to the ship. He stopped 
Chad’s countdown well clear of lift- 
off.

GALAXY 




“Hold her ready, but I don’t think 
it’ll be necessary to go. The plateau 
should give us sufficient clearance 
even if the nearer trees do catch fire. 
We’d better stay on internal atmos- 
phere because of the smoke. Seemly, 
call the old king on the radio and 
check that they’re okay.” 

“Right.” She turned her attention 
to the communications board and 
waited impatiently for Kohl to reply. 
Shortly his voice came through. 

“Thanks for inquiring. Seemly, 
but we’re well protected by natural 
fire-breaks here. How are the ten- 
sions affecting you?” 

“The tensions?” 

“The fire panic— don’t tell me you 
don’t feel it?’ 

“We felt it all right. Caused quite a 
bit of consternation at first. Then we 
realized we were reading the bears’ 
danger, not our own. The feeling’s 
going now.’ 

‘That’s curious. The bears’ general 
pattern of flight has been in your 
direction. You should have the great- 
est concentration of them— hence, 
feel the greatest tension.” 

“That’s something to know. We’ll 
call you back if the situation 
changes.” 

“Answer me one question before 
you switch over. Seemly. Your ship’s 
prepared for liftoff, isn’t it?” 

“All the standard preparations. 
Why did you ask?” 

“Curiosity, that’s all.” 

“It’s more than that. You don’t 
ask questions without a good rea- 
son.” 



“Seemly, would you like to try a 
little experiment?” 

“At this time of night?” 

“It’s an opportunity that’s not 
often repeated.” 

“I’U check with Robin.” 

“Don’t! It may not work too well 
if he knows what to expect. Let’s 
keep this to ourselves. Here’s what I 
suggest you do—” 

64T DON’T like the look of it,” 
JL Andersen said after a while. 
“The fire’s coming too close for 
safety.” 

“But we’re well clear of the trees,” 
said Seemly. 

“We aren’t well clear of the brush 
and grasses. If they catch it’ll come 
right through the area.” 

“What if it does? All that could 
reach the ship would be a few sparks 
and a little heat. That’s nothing 
compared with atmospheric insertion 
conditions. And after all, we are on a 
landing pad.” 

“With the quantity of fuel we 
carry even sparks and a little heat 
don’t add up to a sensible risk. What 
do you say, Chad?” 

“I say let’s get out of here. Heat 
exposure under atmospheric condi- 
tions is a different animal from heat 
of insertion under near vacuum. That 
fire could fry us if the tanks go up.” 
“Sorry, Seemly. You’re outvoted 
two to one— even assuming that as 
captain I weren’t solely responsible 
for the ship. Resume countdown, 
Chad.” 



THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



171 




“Stop being stupid,” said Seemly 
fiercely. “Our fuel reserves only give 
us one liftoff package. Expend that 
now and we’ll have to return to 
Survey Center for refueling before 
we can come back. That’ll take a 
month at least. Think about it. Is our 
position really that serious?” 

“In my opinion, it is,” said Ander- 
sen. “What’s got into you, Seem- 
ly? You don’t usually question my 
flight orders.” 

“I’m trying to make you under 
stand that you’re being irrational. It’s 
the bears’ fear that’s controlling your 
decision. The actual risks are negli- 
gible.” 

Chad swung to the captain’s de- 
fense. His hand made a gesture to 
encompass the sea of fire before 
them. “You call that negligible?” 
“Not if you’re an exposed bear. 
But if you’re a man in a heat-insu- 
lated space vehicle— of course it’s 
negligible. Look at the hull thermis- 
tor readings. Less than the tempera- 
ture the sun’s shining.” 

“They could be misreading,” Chad 
said dubiously. 

“All of them? Stop the nonsense. 
You’re making the same kind of 
mistake I made when I went across 
the crystal bridge. You think you 
know what you’re doing and you 
think you know why, but it’s the 
bears’ panic you’re feeling.” 

Andersen shook his head. “If that 
were true it would also be affecting 
you. You wouldn’t be able to see it 
either.” 

“It is affecting me. But I knew it 



was coming. In fact, I caused it to 
come. King Kohl told me what to 
do.” 

‘Then for Pete’s sake stop it! Let’s 
get down to some rational thinking. 
What did you do to cause it?” 

“I merely switched the ship back 
to circulating the external atmos- 
phere. If the effect is telepathy it’s 
remarkably attenuated by the closing 
of a ventilation port.” 

T en minutes later, with the ship 
again on its own internal atmos- 
phere, they sat and watched the 
brush and short grass burn off 
around the perimeter of the landing 
pad. It was an interesting sight but 
contained no element of hazard 
whatsoever. 

“Well, you’ve proven your point,” 
said Andersen. “Now explain it to 
us.” 

“I can’t explain it— yet. But Kohl 
put me up to it. He knew it would 
work— and to my mind that’s signifi- 
cent. When I mentioned to him 
earlier that the tensions in the ship 
had lessened he guessed that we were 
prepared for liftoff.’ 

Andersen was thoughtful. “So to 
him the effect is both deducible and 
reproducible. Which suggests he 
knows exactly what he’s talking 
about. Apart from the effect’s being 
airborne I don’t know what it is he’s 
got, but we could waste a lot of time 
before we came up with an answer 
we could use with the same degree of 
certainty. I vote we capitulate and

ask the old king to let us see his 
reports.” 

“I don’t see how we can, Robin. 
He’s bending over backward not to 
influence us,” said Chad. 

“For which I’d thank him if I 
thought we might seriously disagree 
with his answers. But he’s on solid 
ground and he knows it. So what’s 
the point in our sitting around ‘dis- 
covering’ what he’s already docu- 
mented? We’re supposed to be pro- 
fessionals, not first-year students.” 
“What brought this on so sudden- 
ly?” asked Chad. “You’ve had a great 
change of heart since yesterday.” 
“Yesterday 1 couldn’t see a reason 
for refusing colonization. Today 1 
can. Picture a colony exposed to 
what we’ve just been through. 
We’ve overreacted to stimuli, consis- 
tently made the wrong decisions and 
generaUy made fools of ourselves. In 
our case, it wasn’t too important. 
We’d have survived even if we had 
placed ourselves into orbit unneces- 
sarily. But in a colony such miscon- 
ceptions could be disastrous. So 1 
take it that’s one of the old king’s 
answers we’re ready to endorse.” 

“I’ll go along with that,” said 
Seemly. “You can’t run a colony if 
you can’t trust the basis of your own 
decisions. The insidiousness of the 
effect is as dangerous as its inten- 
sity.” 

“So how do you propose to tackle 
him?” asked Chad. 

“If you don’t mind,” said Seemly, 
“I’d prefer you left it to me. I think 
I’m just beginning to see the light.” 



HE found Peter Kohl behind the 
usual clutter of papers when she 
went into his office. He looked 
curiously at the letter she handed 
him. 

“What’s this?” 

“A copy of our radio communica- 
tion to Survey Center. It confirms 
that in our opinion Loric is unsuit- 
able for colonization. Reading be- 
tween the lines, the commissioner 
owes you an apology.” 

“I’ve never doubted it, but thanks 
for your support. I take it you’ve 
worked out the answer.” 

“Only the principle. It’s all to do 
with pheromones, isn’t it?” 

“You’re absolutely right! Phero- 
mones— exo-hormones. Airborne 
chemical messengers every bit as 
powerful as the hormones that con- 
trol our bodies. But these originate 
from other organisms, namely the 
bears. They’re effective in negligible 
concentrations and over distances of 
several kilometers if the air currents 
are favorable.” 

“That’s what had me baffled,” 
Seemly said. “I know of pheromones 
as sex attractants and colony regula- 
tors in the insect world, but it’s 
difficult to accept their role in higher 
mammals.” 

“Only because you’ve not thought 
about it before. The canine bitch in 
season broadcasts just that effect. 
And although we try to deny it, 
there’s ample evidence that human 
crowd psychology is similarly con- 
trolled. Mob panic, excitement and 
hysteria are more satisfactorily ex- 




THE OLD KING'S ANSWERS 



173 




plained in terms of pheromone con- 
centration than by any psychological 
mechanism.” 

“I’d never realized that.” 

“It’s a sad reflection on our age 
that we spend too much time looking 
at the rest of the universe and too 
little looking at ourselves. I suspect 
exo-hormones had a strong survival 
value for the human race in our early 
stages of evolution. Unification of 
mental states is a vital part of the 
herd instinct. Somehow we’ve tried 
to forget this basic aspect of nature, 
but reality dies hard. Even the langu- 
age still carries phrases like the scent 
of danger and the smell of fear— un- 
witting acknowledgment of our more 
chemically sensitive past.” 

“Assuming I accept all that as 
true,” said Seemly, “it still doesn’t 
explain about the bears. Surely the 
hormone would be specific to the 
species?” 

“A reasonable assumption— and 
one that has a great deal going for it. 
It’s the basis behind my refusal to 
sign the colonization acceptance. The 
truth is that the bears aren’t bears at 
all. Except for size and bodyweight, 
they’ve more in common with ele- 
mentary Terran primates. Environ- 
mental differences modify the 
courses of natural selection, leading 
to an infinite variety of potential 
evolutionary chains— but the point at 
issue is this; the biochemical simUari- 
ties are such that I can only consider 
Loric bears and Homo sapiens to be 
descended from the same evolution- 
ary stock.” 



“You have to be joking!” 

“Do I?” The old king was serious. 
“Everything from gastric enzymes to 
rhinal morphology points to the 
bears’ being analogues of the early 
ancestors of man. Any interference 
with their evolution could have an 
incalculable effect on the future of 
the organic population of the uni- 
verse. Think about that. Seemly. 
View it against the intentions of the 
Space Conventions. And if you’ve 
any doubts, remember their hor- 
monal and pheromonal makeup is 
exactly interchangeable with your 
own. Coincidence? I doubt it.” 

“But the activity of the phero- 
mones over long distances is fantas- 
tic-” 

“I suspect the human receptors 
aren’t much dimmed. It’s the excre- 
tory mechanisms which have atro- 
phied in man. The sweat accompany- 
ing fear or tension is about the most 
obvious signal we can still produce.” 
“Surely we’d be aware of being 
affected if even a vestigial link be- 
tween humans remained.” 

“Not necessarily. Various things— 
certain psychotropic drugs, for in- 
stance-can affect mental attitudes 
without being called into awareness. 
And just how aware are you of the 
effects of your own hormonal body 
chemistry? It colors your every 
thought, yet you rationalize the feel- 
ing to produce a ‘reason’ for your 
attitude’s being what it is. We’re 
all liars to ourselves. Seemly. Trying 
to rationalize what our molecules are 
urging us to do . .”

44VT^ELL, I guess that ties it 
▼ ▼up,” said Andersen, as he 
signed the final copy of the report. 
“It’s ironic that we had to travel to 
the end of the universe to find out 
we may be strangers to ourselves. I 
suppose you’ll use this- as the starting 
point for a new university research 
project— filling in the gaps in the old 
ideas on crowd psychology and herd 
instinct?” 

“I’U certainly do some research on 
it,” said Seemly. “But I’m not re- 
turning to the university-not yet.” 
“A lecture tour, perhaps?” 

“No. I’ve contacted Space Survey 
for permission to remain here. My 
field experience qualifies me for a 
junior Residency.” 

“Stay on Loric with old king 
Kohl?” Andersen was surprised. 

“There’s a lot of work to be done 
on Loric, Peter’s only scratched the 
surface of it. For the first time we’ve 
a chance to study the human proto- 
type at an early stage in evolution. 



Those bears are laying down the 
deep-mind patterns that can give us a 
whole new view of human psychol- 
ogy. The implications for civilization 
are immense.” 

“And?” 

“And what?” 

“Come off it. Seemly! We’ve been 
together too many trips. I know you 
when you’ve a big idea in mind. 
Don’t tell me you’re thinking of 
making a play for the old king?” 
“Could you blame me? He’s prob- 
ably the best planetary ecologist alive 
and he’s one of the kindest and most 
understanding men I’ve ever met. 
And he isn’t even very old.” 

“Well, I hope you’ve thought 
about it carefully. It could be the old 
long won’t play. A wasted Residency 
here could make a big hole in your 
academic life.” 

“I have thought about it, Robin. 
Really I have. The way I see it, Loric 
in the bears’ mating season is going 
to be a very interesting place.” ★

It's heady fare: packed with 
pleasure and excitement,,, 
crammed with its own rewards. 
And its own definite risks. You 
might become hooked for 
life 

And you’ll know why, once 
you’ve sampled and savored 
science fiction masterpeices 
like these: 

THE HUGO WINNERS, an 
864-page anthology of 23 
prize-winners. They're the tales 
awarded the Hugo, specula- 
tive fiction's equivalent of the 



Oscar, And that could be just 
the beginning of your science 
fiction adventure, JJ* 

Next, there's DUNE, By 
Frank Herbert, the acclaimed 
winner of both The Hugo and 
Nebula awards. It creates a 
frightening yet feasible world .. 
as fabulous as the creatures 
who inhabit it. 

Or consider THE GODS 
THEMSELVES, Isaac Asimov's 
first full-length novel in fifteen 
years The master's never been 
in better form in a thrilling 



story of a world threatened by 
the unchecked advances of 
science. You'll agree that the 
wait for Asimov’s newest was 
worth it.
