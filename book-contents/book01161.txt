CASE AND THE DREAMER 
gripping new noveiia by 

THEODORE 

STURGEON 



. Frank Herbert * Ernest Taves 



14155 



From the U. S. publisher of J.R.R. Tolkien 
comes new insight on the 

MASTER OF MIDDLE-EARTH 




No student of the master’s 
works can afford to be 
without this new book 

FIRST REVIEWS 

“Another book on Tolkien? Yes, and 
this one, which analyzes The Lord of 
the Rings in light of Tolkien’s other 
published writings, is a winner . .The 
book impels the reader to return and 
reread Tolkien with new insight.” 

— Library Journal 



“I know of no other single volume 
which provides so full a picture of 
Tolkien’s theory and practice of fan- 
tasy.”- Richard C. West 

“Should provide a valuable guide to 
the enjoyment of the eminent British 
author’s writings. for Tolkien’s 
fans perhaps the most revealing part 
of the book is Kocher’s discussion of 
‘Leaf by Niggle,’ a story which par- 
allels Tolkien’s own life.”

In an article in the May, 1970 issue of 
The Writer Harry Harrison suggested 
that deep characterization isn’t needed 
in science fiction: “There is little or no 
character development because the 
characters are there to illuminate the 
concept. The story is concept-oriented, 
not person-oriented.” This idea is an 
old one, dating from the pulps, none of 
which were noted for their depth of 
characterization, and is inherent in the 
plot and style of much sf. But I reject 
the assumption that science fiction 
must remain in this rut, that it may deal 
only in scientific extrapolation and 
leave the exploration of interpersonal 
relationships to the mainstream. The 
qualification limits the potential 
greatness of sf. 

Harrison, apparently to prove his 
point, goes on to ask, “Can you re- 
member the name of a character in any 
science fiction story or novel you have 
read recently? Now try this with Gone 



With The Wind or Crime And 
Punishment, or any other general novel 
that you recall with warmth. ” 

/ tried this and found that I could re- 
member Helva and Lessa from Ann 
McCaffrey’s books The Ship Who 
Sang and Dragonrider, Michael Va- 
lentine Smith and Jubal from Stranger 
In A Strange Land, Mahasamatman 
from Zelazny's Lord Of Light, and 
several others. This isn’t very many, 
but Gone With The Wind and other fa- 
mous novels are unfair comparisons. 
What science fiction characters have 
the publicity or are referred to as much 
in conversation or in print as the 
characters in, say, a novel by Dickens, 
Steinbeck, or Faulkner? Or have had a 
four-hour movie to imprint the names 
of characters upon the minds of 
viewers? 

But why shouldn't sf have the quality 
and depth of characterization that 
mainstream fiction does? Why 
shouldn’t we have our share of 
Hamlets, Captain Ahabs, Micawbers, 
and Holden Caul fields? Why shouldn’t 
we have more? We have the potential. 
The mainstream is stuck with interper- 
sonal relations in the “real” world. 
Science fiction is not so limited. We can 
explore such relations at the far end of 
the universe. We can study man not 
only as he is but as he can be. Science 
isn’t content to study the way things 
are — it must see what they can do. 

In the end the two are the same — and 
so it is that Man must be what he be- 
comes. The future is constantly in a 
state of becoming the present. Because 
science fiction has the potential to ex- 
plore this process of becoming it could 
be a truer gauge of human personality 
than the mainstream. Unfortunately, 
this has yet to happen.

Because sf writers must work so 
much harder than other writers at 
creating their backgrounds, most have 
thought that if they could write a fast- 
moving plot with a believable back- 
ground they would have done their job. 

I’m asking for something more. My 
concept of a science fiction story de- 
mands that neither idea nor characteri- 
zation reigns supreme. Both are equal 
in value. 

One basic element in sf writing is the 
concept, the idea or happening outside 
the range of present human ex- 
perience — the other is the separate per- 
sonalities who live through the idea 
element and the individual reactions of 
these characters to the concept. The sf 
story is the interface between the two. 

Such a story would be harder to 
write, true. Perhaps I’m asking the im- 
possible— but I don’t think so. I hope 
not. Ideally such a story would be 
enormously superior to any 
mainstream work. It would combine 
brilliant and insightful characterization 
with the ideas we read science fiction 
for — the ideas that release us from the 
bounds of Earth and space and time 
and propel us to any corner of the 
world of Imagination. 

Richard Stooker

Directions: 

It has been my feeling that science 
fiction — good science fiction of the 
past — explored man’s future and how 
his follies would affect his planet. And 
that as more people have begun to look 
toward the future — instead of simply 
living each day through — a good many 
have come to realize that science fiction 
is not merely escapist literature but an 



avenue to speculation, criticism and 
even to sounding warnings. The com- 
pelling reasons have been the invention 
of nuclear weapons, growing pollution 
and other environmental damage and 
increasing social friction and unrest. 
Too, our waxing dependence on science 
and technology virtually demand that 
we no longer confine ourselves to 
surviving today — or there may not be a 
tomorrow. 

For this reason I believe that the le- 
gitimate role of science fiction has 
moved from the far future into the 
near— from time-distant adventures 
into problems of the present. Science 
fiction now is about Now. 

This movement closer to home from 
the deep ends of space belongs largely 
to the generation born in the late fif- 
ties — after the space operas’ heyday. 
These people today can read science 
fiction without fear of being laughed at. 
They can look for and hope to find 
answers to such questions as — where 
are we today? 

Some call this the new awareness and 
it doesn’t mean merely that people are 
troubled. It also means that they want 
more than a world of metal and 
concrete and by keeping our informed 
options open — that living sense of 
wonder — science fiction can hold out a 
promise.

CASE AND 
THE DREAMER 



9 





I F, at the very moment Case 
died, you had aimed a laser (a 
tight one) at the spot from Earth — 
and if you could have ridden the 
beam front for a thousand years 
(impossible, of course) you might 
have seen his coffin. 

It had not been meant to be a cof- 
fin. Ships have lifeboats when they 
fail and the boats have lifebelts in 
case they fail and the coffin had 
once answered the last purpose — 
but now and for all those centuries 
it was and had been Case’s coffin. 

It lay in lightlessness, its wide- 
spectrum shrieks of distress forever 
stilled. It tumbled ever so slowly, 
pressed by light long gone, because 
it had never been told to stop. 

Case, aged a thousand and some 
hundred and perhaps a couple of 
dozen and a fraction (do the dead 
grow older?) years, lay in the sealed 
cylinder. He was dressed in inboard 
fatigues (which long ago — even in 
Case’s long ago — had evolved into 
practically nothing) consisting of 
barely enough material to carry the 
brassard identifying him as a 
Senior Grade Lieutenant and dis- 
playing the convoluted symbol of 
his service branch. EX^, it read, 
once you got past the art. Ex- on 
many levels: exploration, extra- 
solar, extragalactic, extratemporal 
and more — plus the possibility ma- 
trix: expatriate, ex-serviceman, ex- 
officio, exit. For upon entering 
no man made plans for himself — 
not if they involved any here and 
now. Or anyone. 



An invisible, intangible some- 
thing brushed the coffin just once 
(once was enough) and there then 
appeared something utterly outside 
Case’s experience in all the explo- 
ration, all the discovery, all the ad- 
venture in his conscious life. It was 
a stroboscopic flicker which, more 
swiftly than the eye could 
comprehend or the brain register, 
became with each pulse a structure 
twice as large as it had been before, 
until it reached a point hardly ten 
meters away from the tumbling cof- 
fin and stopped, glowing. There was 
no deceleration in this approach, 
for there was no motion as motion 
is understood. With each pulsation 
the craft — for it was indeed a 
ship — eased to exist here and reap- 
peared there. The distance between 
here and there was controllable and 
could vary widely. This had to be 
so, for during the last three 
pulses — during which its approach 
to the coffin was meters, a meter, 
some centimeters — its size barely 
altered. 

A brief pause. Then a disk no 
larger than a saucer spun out from 
the seamless hull of the vessel, 
hovered for a moment near the 
slowly tumbling coffin, fell back 
and around to match its rotation. It 
placed itself near one end of the cof- 
fin and emitted a squirt of flame — 
and another. The tumbling slowed 
and, with a third impulse, stopped. 

Another pause, while emanations 
from the ship probed, bathed, 
searched, touched, tested, checked 



10 



GALAXY 




and rechecked. Then on the flawless 
hull appeared lines tracing out a rec- 
tangle. Inside the rectangle the hull 
appeared to dissolve. The tiny 
saucer moved behind the coffin, 
made its meticulous squirt and the 
coffin moved precisely through the 
intersection of imaginary diagonals 
athwart the doorway. 

Inside, four columns of pale 
orange light sprang up from the 
deck, supporting and guiding the 
coffin until it was fully contained, 
whereupon the rectangular opening 
hazed over, darkened, became solid 
seamless hull again. With a brief 
shrill hiss atmospheric pressure ap- 
peared, equalizing the outside of 
the coffin’s shell with whatever was 
inside. Then the four orange beams 
turned the coffin and moved it 
toward a spot on the forward 
bulkhead which irised open to a cor- 
ridor, a tall oval in cross-section, 
glowing with sourceless, shadowless 
blue-white light. Again a doorway 
shut behind the coffin and it was 
moved smoothly and silently to an 
open door near the far end of the 
corridor. Here the beams checked 
the coffin, turned it and slid it into a 
room. It came to rest in a space 
between two banks of equipment. 
On the left was a control panel of 
some complex kind. It carried no 
switches or knobs, but had instead 
arrays of small disks floating two 
handbreaths away from the panels, 
liach glowed with its own hue and 
intensity. On the right stood a great 
bank of indicators. Case (if he had 



been alive) would have found the 
calibrations and indicators in- 
comprehensible. 

T 'HERE appeared on a 
walkway — which presently sur- 
rounded the coffin — a blue man, 
hooded and gloved, whose body daz- 
zled without being excessively 
bright, who seemed to be not quite 
transparent, yet not solid — who 
seemed in some way out of focus. 
At no time did he touch anything 
with his small hands and he moved 
without a stride — he seemed to 
glide or slide from place to place. 

He stood for a time with his 
hands behind him and his hooded 
head bent, regarding the coffin. He 
then turned to the control bank. 
Deftly he activated a half-dozen sys- 
tems by passing his hand between 
the face of the console and certain 
pertinept floating disks, each of 
which lit up. A gate at the front of 
the room opened and two metal 
arms, bearing a glowing semicircle 
of energy, moved the length of the 
coffin, down and back. The field of 
the curved bus bar rendered the top 
half of the coffin transparent. The 
arms retracted, the gate closed. The 
blue man made his swift touchless 
passes at the console and the 
various glowing, floating disks 
faded to dark. 

The blue man placed his hands be- 
hind his back and stood for a long 
time regarding the body inside the 
coffin — the (compared with his 
own) overlong arms and legs, the 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



11 




hint of bony ridges over the corpse’s 
eyes, the heavy pectoral muscles 
and the flat stomach. After a time 
he glided around to the other side of 
the coffin and inspected that view — 
the hollow needles still embedded in 
the antecubitals, the bronze- 
colored, tonsure-shaped helmet 
clamped to the head, the thick hair 
that tumbled around its edges. For 
a long time, astonished, he gazed at 
Case’s beard, his flag of defiance, 
which, in the last days of his life, he 
had allowed to grow far past the 
limits imposed by X^. 

The blue man returned to the con- 
trols and set up a complex se- 
quence. Again the gate at the front 
of the room opened. A new device 
trundled out and approached the 
coffin. It looked like a multiple pro- 
jector studded with gimbaled lenses 
and the housings of small and 
highly diverse field generators, 
together with a positioning frame 
and sets of folded, tool-bearing 
arms. The telescopic legs arched, 
straddled the coffin and positioned 
the projector over it. Urged by the 
sure, fleet hands of the blue man, 
the projector came alive with 
threadlike beams, some visible and 
brilliant — blue, gold, scarlet — some 
invisible but faintly shrill in the thin 
atmosphere the room had assumed 
to match the pressure inside the cof- 
fin. The beams apparently were 
probes and stimulators, pressors 
and tractors, gauges and analyzers, 
samplers and matchers and testers. 

Without pause they reached their 



summations and took further 
action. Mechanical hands searched 
and solved the seals. Gases were 
mixed and injected, while the at- 
mosphere in the chamber was 
matched in quality and kind and 
pressure (a process which had no ef- 
fect whatever on the blue man). The 
seals were cracked and the coffin 
was opened. While the body re- 
mained where it was the open coffin 
sank away, to and through the 
deck. Case’s corpse seemed to be 
floating in midair, though it was 
not. Gravity had not yet been ap- 
plied, but the body was held from 
drifting or shifting by tractor beams 
while the crouching machine tapped 
the tubes from the needles in Case’s 
arms, replacing their contents. The 
same process was used on the small 
bronze helmet. A diathermic field 
adjusted the body’s temperature, 
through and through and all at 
once. Tubed needles snaked out to 
the groin, the abdominal cavity, the 
sides of the neck. Warm fluids 
began coursing through them while 
pressor beams gently manipulated 
the joints, the muscles, the chest. 

. .and suddenly Case sat up. But 
you can’t sit up afloat in midair, 
supported by intangible columns of 
force and entangled by needle- 
pointed tubes, electrodes, probes. 
Even so, his movement was so sud- 
den and so violent that the swift re- 
flexes of the blue man, the built-in 
fail-safes of the systems, could not 
prevent his wild angry flailing and 
his tortured shout: “Jan!” But that

was as far as he got before the 
massive tranquilizer hit his brain 
and he relaxed, sleeping. 

Two tubes were gently replaced. 

A broken hollow needle was ex- 
tracted and another put in. 

And a sleeping man is not a dead 
man. Let him sleep, said the master 
computer and the blue man 
dissolved away. The lights dimmed 
and Case slept. 

TAN!” 

J Case’s waking cry was tor- 
tured and hoarse — but it had not 
been like the syllable that had torn 
his throat and half his mind and 
mingled with the continuing crash 
of his chemical jets on that terrible 
launch, the last before he died. The 
lifebelts — the coffins — had rested 
side by side on the escarpment 
where he and Jan had dragged them 
barely ahead of capture by the — by 
the — (a thought missing here: oc- 
cluded, forgotten) and — and . 

. .and his craft had launched — 
hers had not. 

No one, no man anywhere, had 
been as helpless, as furious as Case. 
Programing the escape belts had 
been so simple that failure had 
taken on an implacable quality, a 
constancy of misfortune. Case 
himself had set up the sequences — 
he himself had taken the irrevo- 
cable precaution of locking them in, 
of tying his command controls to 
hers, of canceling any possible over- 
ride. 

And his craft had launched and 



hers had not, had not, had not . 
Jan! 

C ASE slept on in the dimness, 
apparently free-floating, ac- 
tually caged by gentle, unbreakable 
beams. After enough hours (the 
master computer knew exactly the 
meaning of “enough”) the 
sourceless light increased. The 
figure of the blue man appeared 
within it and gained its almost- 
density. Moving to the console, the 
blue man activated certain of the 
telltales on the opposite bulkhead 
and studied them. Apparently satis- 
fied, he turned back, made a 
number of careful adjustments and 
passed his hand behind a master- 
switch disk. 

A deep hum began, grew in 
intensity until checked by the blue 
man’s intangible hand. The sound 
began to rise in pitch, fell again, 
rose and steadied. It began to 
pulsate: eleven, fourteen, sixteen 
cycles — eighteen — and there it 
held. It was joined by a series of 
matching tones, high harmonics, 
multiples, tones set apart by frac- 
tions to set up beat frequencies. 
These in turn orchestrated to the 
heavy subsonics. The entire struc- 
ture of sound continued self- 
adjusting to itself and to the 
readouts connected through Case’s 
bronze helmet, until at last the 
whole living sonority was tailored 
exactly to him, to the emanations of 
his brain, the doorways of his mind, 
the subtle temporal cells, the 



14 



GALAXY 




neurons and synapses of his brain. 

Case was no longer asleep. 

Something began to press against 
the integument of his mind, gently, 
irresistibly, until it dissolved the 
wall and entered. It sought out 
those storage cells as yet unoccu- 
pied, meticulously respecting 
treasures and privacies, looking 
into nothing, asking only space to 
lay down new learning. Once this 
was found, it withdrew, leaving (re- 
member: all is figure) a line into 
each compartment. 

New knowledge and new ideation 
flowed swiftly through these lines. 
Language. Idiom. The ideological, 
analogical, mythological under- 
bracing of idiom. Case was given 
everything a colleague and contem- 
porary of the blue man might be ex- 
pected to have, except knowledge of 
himself and his current situation. 
That he would get in his own way, 
in his own time — the ultimate cour- 
tesy. 

The hypnotic sound faded. The 
lights changed slightly. The blue 
man put his hands behind his back 
and waited. 

Case awoke.

funguses capable of weaving nooses 
quick and strong enough to snap 
around a salamander, ingenious 
enough to wrap and digest it. On 
the microphysical level are the end- 
lessly subtle phenomena or solution 
and suspension, of freeze and thaw, 
while the living things encapsulate 
and encyst and metamorphose — no 
end of wonders. 

Consider the female cattle tick. 
Hatching in the ground, she sheds 
and grows and sheds and grows 
some more, finally sheds and 
mates. At last, carrying within her 
the encapsulated sperm, she climbs. 
Eyeless, she is yet guided to climb 
upward until she finds a limb tip 
where she clings until her reflexes 
are fired by a single, special 
spark — the odor of butyric acid, 
which is found in the sweat of 
warm-blooded mammals. At that 
she leaps — and if she misses she 
will climb patiently again and find 
another tip and hang there, waiting. 
She has been known to hang there 
for eighteen years — and yet react 
instantly and fully in the presence 
of the one thing she is equipped to 
take and designed to need. She will 
feed for a day, whereupon she 
releases the sperm she has hoarded 
to the eggs she carries. She falls 
then and dies. And the fertilized

eggs are ready to take up the cycle. 

Her life, then, is composed of 
instants and episodes (as is yours) 
and could you communicate with 
her she might recall episodes — the 
second shedding, the mating, the 
climb, the leap. The wait, through 
drought, freeze, windstorm — why, 
that was another instant, another 
moment, for during that wait she 
could be called alive only by nearly 
misusing the word. It was another 
instant and less memorable than 
that first plunge into warm blood. 

Case’s first awakening, then, was 
but an instant after that terrible 
launch (for he could, but would not 
remember the long despair during 
which he gave himself to the belt’s 
life-support, life-suspension sys- 
tems). He might have foregone 
these through grief and fury had not 
his own emergency programing 
been as implacable and unforgiving 
as that he had laid on the belts — un- 
conscious, automatic, indelible. 

(But hers didn’t launch, didn’t 
launch.) 

Therefore Case awoke (the first 
time) but an instant after that ter- 
rible wrench — therefore his hoarse 
cry. Therefore he was the only 
human being in all the universe who 
could remember so distant an event 
as the escape from that hellish un- 
known planet — and to him it was 
not distant at all. For such is the 
nature of time that a man’s clock 
and a man’s soul might give him 
true measurements, but the truths 
need not be the same. If you are to 



understand Case you must under- 
stand this. 

So it was that he knew time had 
passed when he awoke the second 
time — he knew he had been asleep. 
He knew he felt well and rested and 
that he was hungry and thirsty. He 
did not know where he was and 
when he tried to sit up he could not. 

“Lie still,’’ said the blue man. 
“Don’t try to move while I get 
those needles out of you.” 

C ASE’S first disobedient reflex 
was to move, fast and hard. 
When he again found he couldn’t he 
saw the sense of resting and re- 
laxed. The blue man made quick, 
sure passes at the console and a 
piece of equipment glided out of the 
bulkhead somewhere beyond 
Case’s head. It came to him, ex- 
tended glittering gentle arms and 
tools and drew the tubes, applied 
cool creams, released, untied, 
removed the various devices which 
had given him back his life, while 
Case lay wondering what language 
the blue man had spoken — and how 
it was that he could understand it. 

The equipment slid away from 
him and traveled to its gate in the 
forward bulkhead, which swallowed 
it. Case lay still, looking up at the 
blue man, whose hooded, concealed 
face could tell him nothing, but 
whose relaxed, hands-behind-back 
pose was one of watchful waiting. 
Mysterious, yes. Menacing, no. 

Case moved tentatively, found no 
restraints, sat up. He sat on nothing 



16 



GALAXY 




visible and, looking down, found 
himself apparently afloat a meter 
above the deck. He had a second of 
vertigo. It passed as the blue man, 
with instant understanding, waved 
at a control. Case was immediately 
supported and surrounded by a 
soft, firm chair which faded in 
around him. He sat up straight, 
looked at the chair arms, around at 
the back and then at the blue man, 
whose calming gesture was com- 
manding enough to cause him to 
lean back — watchful of course, but 
no longer alarmed. 

“Lieutenant Hardin — ” 

Case blinked. It was so long, even 
as he knew time, since he had heard 
that name that he had all but forgot- 
ten it was his. 

“I’m usually called Case,” he 
said. “And who are you?” 

A pause, then the blue man 
(faceless, but with a smile in his 
voice) said, “There really is no 
simple answer to that question. Just 
call me the Doctor for the time 
being. 

“Doctor?” The word meant the 
right thing as Case said it, but felt 
unfamiliar to his tongue and throat. 
“Doctor,” he said again in his own 
(old) language. The sound felt bet- 
ter but he could sense it meant 
nothing to the blue man. 

“That’s right,” said the Doctor, 
“you’ve learned a new language — 
new to you, ancient to me.” 

The idea of hypnogogia — sleep- 
learning — was not unfamiliar to 
Case, though he had never ex- 



perienced anything as — well — as 
finished as this. Learning and using 
information by hypnogogia had al- 
ways been an instant translation (or 
rapid analog) process to him — 
think cat and come out with gleep, 
or whatever the appropriate word 
was in the learned system. In this 
case, he was even thinking in the 
new language. Yet if he wished to 
use his old one he could do so 
merely by decision and without spe- 
cial effort. All gain, no loss. 

Case closed his eyes. Did his new 
language have words for grief, 
anger and self-detestation? Yes, it 
did. Gratitude? Saved my life . 
There is this about dying an- 
guished — the anguish dies with you, 
as does the pain. What, then, if you 
are revived — and with you, the an- 
guish? This was what mattered at 
the moment, not a stupid: Where 
am I? He was on a ship that had 
picked him up. Whose ship, bound 
for where? That mattered, too, but 
not yet. Gratitude? 

T here were a million ques- 
tions to ask and nine hundred 
thousand of them conflicted with 
his conditioning to give no infor- 
mation unless he must' — and on 
certain matters, no information at 
all. 

“You were the executive officer 
on the ship Outbound.” said the 
Doctor, “an Explorer class dis- 
covery vessel launched from Terra 
Central on a mission to penetrate 
the galactic arm und make certain 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



17 




experiments in space, among them 
the testing of a new version of the 
flicker-field mode of faster-than- 
light travel. A design error caused 
the vessel to accelerate out of con- 
trol to velocities exceeding anything 
regarded at the time as theoreti- 
cally possible. Compounding the 
Outbound disaster was the ship’s 
ability to gather intergalactic hy- 
drogen molecules for fuel, which, at 
the unexpected velocities, caused an 
increment exceeding expenditure of 
fuel. The only possible result must 
have been an explosion or other dis- 
ruption of the vessel. What actually 
happened is not known, because by 
the time it happened the ship was 
far outside any possibility of de- 
tection.” 

Case felt a flash of irritation. “If 
you’ve already picked all this out of 
my head — why go over it?” 

Gently the Doctor said, “We 
took nothing from you. We respect 
personal integrity above all other 
things, and the privacy of a man’s 
choices are his own. No — what I 
have just said came from the ar- 
chives.” 

Archives. Not files or retrieval 
banks — archives. 

“How long were we — was the 
Outbound lost?” 

“By Terra Central reckoning — 
some twelve hundred years.” 

“I couldn’t have been suspended 
for twelve hundred years!” 

“You weren’t. You died.” After a 
time the Doctor said, “Would you 
like to be by yourself?” 



“If you don’t mind,” Case whis- 
pered. 

The blue man faded and disap- 
peared. Case saw this, but could 
only stare dully. 

AN. Oh. Jan . 

His mind for a while was a 
wordless throb. Deep in him, where 
lived the observer all of us carry — 
the merciless one who stands off 
watching — was name-calling: Idiot! 
Sentimental slob! Why is it a 
greater grief to you to know she is a 
thousand years dead than a mere 
two hundred? Angry, are you? 
Angry! What are you going to do 
with your anger? 

“Something,” he whispered. 
“Something — ” 

He threw a slitted glance around. 
He saw nothing in this bland place 
to strike out against, so with one 
blow he fisted his palm so hard he 
numbed it — and while waiting for it 
to begin to ache he caught in 
memory a flash of ugly laughter. 
Ugly? The sound was disembodied, 
mouthless, deep, cheerful — with the 
cheerfulness of a being with a better 
mousetrap and Case had been the 
mouse. Why couldn’t he remember 
the mouth, the face, the situation? 

Occlusion — the profound will not 
to remember. Occlusion is an act of 
survival, an unwillingness of the 
mind to replay some terrible shock. 
Yet occlusion always does leave a 
trigger in plain sight and that is also 
a survival trait — for the deep mind 




18 



GALAXY 




wants always to know where the 
danger is and what to fear. To be as 
close to his deep mind as Case was 
(his training had made him so) was 
to tread always the edge of internal 
terrors, to be placed always at the 
point of decision. Shall I recall the 
trauma? Or bury the trigger again? 
Only at this edge did he have the 
ability to react with the fabled 
swiftness of the Corps. 

He let the trigger, his memory of 
the laugh, fade and closed his eyes, 
commanding some alternative to 
come to mind. Anything. Anything 
else, anything instead. Something, 
perhaps, before the laughter. 

Something like — well, before the 
laughter was the chase and before 
that the landing and before that the 
lifeboat and before that . Before 
that no one would ever know, be- 
cause the crew had abandoned ship 
in the flickering grayness of trans- 
light velocity, under or over, who 
knew? No instrumentation existed 
to tell precisely what had hap- 
pened — and no instruments told the 
truth anyway. Electrons had flowed 
in strange ways, coils and fields had 
been distorted and wild. No one 
had ever been there before — no 
probe had ever reported back. Scut- 
tlebutt, off-duty talk— what would 
happen to you if you bailed out of a 
ship at faster-than-light velocities? 
They said that as you reach such 
speeds, time approaches zero and 
mass approaches infinity. As logic 
approaches perfection, truth ap- 
proaches zero. Someone said C (the 



terminal velocity) was a gateway 
into another universe or into 
another phase in phased space. 
Some predicted death and disso- 
lution, for all electrical phenom- 
ena of biochemistry would, by all 
the rules of physics, be so changed 
that organization of matter and of 
life would be disrupted. And some 
said no; transformation phenomena 
(mass into energy into space into 
time, each proportionately inter- 
changeable) might retain pattern — 
and some inconceivably different 
form of life might be possible. Over 
it all was the certainty that to bail 
out, away from the guarding life- 
support, artificial gravity and all 
the other tissues of the man-made 
womb that was a spaceship, would 
be expulsion into something utterly 
strange and hostile. Bailing out in 
the stratosphere, with 95% of the at- 
mosphere underneath one, and a 
temperature drop of perhaps two 
hundred degrees — the name of that 
is Lethal. Multiply it by what, then, 
in space, in that strange country 
where time itself might turn on its 
tail? 

And always the other argument 
that velocity really is not a com- 
manding factor — that early in the 
days of railroading, wise men said 
that the ears would bleed, the sight 
would fail, the blood cease to circu- 
late at twenty miles an hour. And 
that all the talk of C was the same 
logical untruth— speed has no 
absolute, velocity is always relative 
and the only danger in bailing out is 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



19 




the matter of being a hell of a way 
from anywhere. 

Well, Case had found out (with 
Jan, with Jan) that one could live 
through a bailout. Not how — or 
what had actually happened. He re- 
membered the shrill alarm, the 
echoing-everywhere voice saying 
abandon, the clutch of fear on the 
way to his assigned lifeboat station 
when the main hull started to 
buckle and the airtight barrier slam- 
med down between him and his 
boat (and a good thing too; that 
whole section of the ship cracked 
away and exploded outward, boats 
and all). The lights had gone, as had 
the gravity. Surprisingly clear in his 
mind was the wild scramble 
through familiar-unfamiliar gates 
and corridors to his alternate 
station, where he tumbled through 
the hatch (on top of someone else — 
he didn’t know who) and kicked out 
and squirmed around, treading the 
other as he craned back to the cor- 
ridor to see if anyone else was 
coming — but then, no one could 
see. If anyone had been or had not 
been coming, his conscience was 
clear (though his regret could never 
be), for the automatic override had 
canceled his manual launch con- 
trols and he had fallen back into the 
lifeboat as it clanged shut and 
banged away from the ship. The 
boat’s inertia field had taken over 
and saved him the terrible agony of 
acceleration, but its vibratory ef- 
fect, chiming down the scale, had 
been an agony of its own. His ship- 



mate had been as preoccupied with 
this as he and the only thing he 
could clearly recall was a spinning 
glimpse of the ship with a ragged 
cavity in its midsection — the first 
part to blow off, the part that had 
contained his lifeboat station — 
limned in flickering arcs as the rup- 
tured power cables lashed and 
vomited. 

HI 

P ^ROBABLY they were both un- 
conscious for a time. Case’s sub- 
sequent hazy inspection of the 
instruments gave him no useful in- 
formation at all, except that the life- 
boat was sound and that its 
converter was picking up a 
reasonable amount of usable 
atomic hydrogen, so that fuel and 
life-support would not be a 
problem. Almost detachedly he 
watched his hands on the controls, 
running through the implanted 
checklist, setting the computer to 
hunt for a ship and/or a terrestrial 
planet, putting the drive to 
maximum (the computer would not 
use maximum, but in that setting 
max was available) and turning on 
the life-support complex — with 
alarms. A touch on one control 
took inventory of all stores and 
reported them complete. Another 
applied spin. The lifeboat had the 
contours of a shark with an exag- 
gerated dorsal fin. The body 
contained stores, converters, fuel — 
the fin was instrumentation and 



20 



GALAXY 




living quarters for six. Spin was on 
the long axis — subjective “down” 
was therefore in the tip of the fin. 

All snug, all safe. 

No hope. 

Plenty of room, plenty of food 
and air for six. For two the accom- 
modations were palatial. 

He looked at last at his ship- 
mate — not that he hadn’t cared be- 
fore, but his ingrained priorities 
were conditions first, personnel 
second. 

His first reaction had to do with 
all the people his fellow traveler 
was not. He wasn’t Old Growl, the 
captain, or that funny little Henny 
from the black gang, or Bowker, 
who had always puzzled him and 
whom he had always wanted to 
know better when he could get 
around to it — or Mary Dee, who 
had never found out that he had 
liked her better walking away, such 
was her hair, such was her face. The 
face he now saw was one of the 
background pieces, one of the 
others, you know, the people who 
make up the bulk of the roster in 
your memory of some function or 
event or institution you attended 
once. Gander, Dancer, something 
like that. Janssen. XBC, xenobio- 
chemist, usually found in a corner 
with two or three others from 
Science Section, talking shop. Cor- 
rection. Listening to other people 
talking shop. 

“Janifer?” 

“Janocek.” She sat with an elbow 
hooked around a soft stanchion, 

CASE AND THE DREAMER 




21 





where she had anchored herself be- 
fore spin. She had apparently been 
watching the checkout intently, 
following it step by step. Case out- 
ranked her — and her conditioning 
would make her defer to him but 
not miss any of the routine. Clearly, 
at this moment, they both felt the 
weight of the programing leave 
them. Optimum conditioning takes 
care of essentials down to the finest 
detail, true, but then it stops. They 
were on their own. 

“Case Hardin, Lieutenant S.G.,” 
he said. 

“Yes, sir, I know.” There was a 
foolish pause. He should have 
known she knew. There were more 
ratings than officers on a ship. To 
the ratings the officers were never a 
sea of faces. And his “S.G.” hung 
pompously in the air between them. 
Her eyes were long almonds, so 
bright they were opaque (but, one 
realized, not from the inside) and 
her hair was drawn back almost 
painfully tight from a seamless 
brow. She was slender, tall (both 
just this side of “too”) and there 
was an odd, controlled quality in 
her voice, as if it were kept in the 
middle register by a conscious ef- 
fort. She asked, “What happened?” 

He shrugged and nodded at the 
telltales. No ship, no boats, no 
planet, no sun anywhere. Some de- 
bris of the disaster dwindled as their 
launch took them away— nothing 
large enough to have saved or 
sheltered anyone or the computer 
would have reported it. As the life- 



boat spun, a paleness washed across 
the screens — the end of the arm of a 
distant galaxy. Case touched a con- 
trol and fixed a view of it. .“Nobody 
tells the ratings anything,” she ob- 
served. 

“They don’t tell a lieutenant 
much either. We were testing a new 
drive. Theoretically it wouldn’t 
work in gravitic fields of a certain 
density, so we headed for deep 
space with a conventional drive. We 
were okay by the numbers. The 
math section gave us a safety factor 
of three or better — I mean, we were 
three times farther into intergalac- 
tic space than was needed to test 
safely. Well — they were wrong — or 
the design was wrong or somebody 
did soniething wrong on the bridge. 
We cut in the new drive and 
couldn’t turn it off. Nothing could 
turn it off. It was working outside 
our power supply, beyond control. 
We just accelerated until we broke 
up.” 

“And there’s no one — ” 

“No one. Just us.” 

T hey found themselves looking 
at one another. He wondered 
what was happening behind the 
shine of those long eyes? Were they 
asking. Why you? Or was she 
mourning somdOne? For a second 
he had a deep flash of regret. He 
did not gossip, did not pry, never 
watched other people’s affections 
and partnerings and personal pecca- 
dillos. Case had a searching and 
hungry mind, but it was pointed at 



22 



GALAXY 




the job, the responsibility, the 
mission, and accepted a deliberate 
repression of his own wants. He 
was a good officer. Whether or not 
he was known as a good man had 
never concerned him. And perhaps 
it did not have to concern him now. 
He was half the population — and 
the ranking half at that. She had no 
one else to set standards and com- 
parisons by and from the looks of 
things matters would so continue. 
He sighed (why?) and turned away 
from her. He found nothing to 
recollect about her. He would have 
to start knowing her from scratch, 
from this point forward, while 
she — well, she knew who he was. In 
his world one was used to living in 
close quarters with other people — 
there were so many of them 
everywhere. But because there were 
so many there was always a choice. 
But now. 

He turned to the console and sat 
down. He stared glumly at the faint 
stain of stardust that was a 
galaxy — who knew which one? — 
and the blackness everywhere else. 
Hopelessly he set up a computation 
for distances. Was it eight hundred 
light-years — or even nine — to that 
nearest star? Something like that, 
surely. The boat could accelerate to 
a fraction of C — a large fraction, to 
be sure, but still a fraction — and the 
suspension gear might keep two hu- 
mans alive for a minimum of two, a 
maximum of five hundred years. 

The boat was equipped to care 
for six — could the life-suspension 



systems be manifolded, so that they 
could revive and use new gear be- 
fore the old was played out? Would 
the unused systems remain effective 
after great lengths of time? 

He glanced over his shoulder. His 
biochemist might have some 
answers. But first — some numbers. 

Expertly he flicked his computer 
commands. In scanning a galactic 
cloud even at eight hundred light- 
years the computer could only 
operate in an area of probability to 
lay a course to a point in the cloud 
where terrestrial planets were most 
likely to be — and terrestrial planets 
are not likely to be anywhere. He 
set the computer to seeking and 
turned away from it. HeJiad at last 
done whatever he could, a condition 
he dreaded. Nothing was now left 
for him but to face a whole matrix 
of things he had never concerned 
himself with or trained himself for. 
He had been trained to confront 
problems, not people, not a 
person — not, for that matter, 
himself. He turned to confront it, 
her, himself, and found her crying. 

She said, “We’re going to die, 
aren’t we?’’ 

Everything about her — body, 
voice and eyes — asked only a 
simple answer, a denial, and he 
didn’t have it for her. He never 
thought of lying (that was for those 
who knew more about people than 
he knew) and it never occurred to 
him to touch her, which would have 
served quite well, for she could have 
made her own interpretation. 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



23 




He said, “I guess so, Janifer — ” 
and even got her name wrong. 

<< ■pvOCTOR.” 

The sourceless light in- 
creased and the blue man appeared. 
“I’m hungry,” Case said. 

“In the chair,” said the Doctor. 
“Are you feeling better?” 

Case knew what the Doctor knew 
from the wide array of telltales — 
and that it was not his physical con- 
dition that was the subject of the 
query. But “better?” 

He said, “You mean — am I up to 
remembering? I’ll try. After the 
ship broke up I escaped in a lifeboat 
with a rating, a Janet Janocek, 
xenomicrobiologist — ” The wide 
soft arm of the chair slitted open 
and uncovered a warm one-liter 
sucker. Case took it, pulled strong- 
ly at it and swallowed. The con- 
tents were bland but satisfying. 
He continued: “I can’t remember 
what happened after we realized 
we were beyond help, out of range, 
with no reason to hope.” 

“You were picked up in a life- 
belt — you called it a coffin. What 
happened to the lifeboat?” 

“Oh, that was smashed up on the 
landing.” 

The Doctor did not comment, but 
waited. Case said, “I mean, I can’t 
remember what we did all those 
days, a hundred and four of 
them — ” What he meant was that 
he wanted to remember them in 
order, every hour and minute, be- 
cause now they were precious, price- 



less, and because now he could 
not understand why, except for 
certain vivid scenes, they had been 
at the time a succession of grays on 
grays to be lived through. He had 
been with Jan — Jan. Whatever she 
was later, she did not become — she 
was what she had been that one 
time when he had watched her cry, 
had sat watching her, his useless 
hands pressed between his knees, 
miserably, until she stopped. Then 
the days — ship’s time had said they 
were days — and you can sleep just 
so much and spend so much time in 
the tingler (had she used everything 
in the tingler? He had. Oh, Jan!). 
He had checked the console daily 
and entered “Ditto” in the log. And 
then there had been nothing else to 
do but confront the other person 
and he just hadn’t known how! 

And all the while, he thought with 
a kind of awe, this other person was 
Jan. 

Thus it is when anguish and grief 
loop back on themselves. He 
wished he had it to do over, terror 
and hopelessness and all — a small 
price for those hundred and four 
days, ' now that he knew who she 
was. Had been. 

“I remember,” said Case, almost 
smiling, “Jan’s starting a discussion 
with me about living, about staying 
alive — about why. Why did we keep 
a log and check the console and do 
the active and passive exercises and 
use the tingler and all — why, when 
we knew we were going to die? And 
all I could say was, what’s changed? 



24 



GALAXY 




What was the difference, really, 
between what we were doing and 
what we had always done? We 
knew where we were going to die — 
right in that lifeboat — when the 
time came, but otherwise we were 
just like everyone else, everywhere, 
trying to stay alive as long as 
possible. I knew she hadn’t wanted 
to die a hundred days ago and I 
knew she didn’t want to die that 
minute — and neither did 1. But why 
live now? She demanded an answer 
to that — it was just something she 
didn’t know. And I said that I 
didn’t know either, but that 
everyone ever born has been under 
a death sentence just for having 
been born — and the fact that for us 
there was no hope did not change 
anything. Hope makes life easier 
but its lack doesn’t make life im- 
possible — millions upon millions 
have lived long lives without it. And 
this discussion was (suddenly he re- 
membered) on the hundred and 
second day — and the hooter started 
up.” At last Case did smile. 

“The hooter.” 

“Collision alarm, for condition 
yellow. Somehow out there we were 
coming up on something — or some- 
thing was coming up on us. It was 
enormous. It shouldn’t have ap- 
peared as it did, so close and 
without previous warning. But it 
did. And don’t ask me for explana- 
tions. It was a planet larger than 
Luna and almost as large as Terra. 
I shouldn’t have said ‘planet’ be- 
cause there was no primary, but 



you’ll understand why I call it that. 

“I thought Jan would cry again. 
Maybe she did. I was busy at the 
console. “I probed for an at- 
mosphere — the object was big 
enough. Negative. I got it on the 
screen and read the range and I 
couldn’t believe it. To have ap- 
peared so quickly it had to be ap- 
proaching from ahead, adding velo- 
cities — but even then it should have 
been detected days before. Actually 
it wasn’t coming head-on — it was 
angling in from the left. I computed 
the angle — the object was only two 
hundred and fifty thousand kil- 
ometers away and intersection was 
due in about thirty hours. I got 
magnification on the screen — a 
rocky spheroid, but by radar alone 
I couldn’t tell much more than 
that.” 

(And Jan had said, “Please — oh, 
please — ” and when he had turned 
to look at her she had been standing 
with her hands over her ears. 
“Please turn off the hooter. Case.”) 

C ASE did not explain to the 
Doctor why he smiled again. 
“I needed light to make any kind of 
survey, but out there was nothing, 
not even starlight. I remember 
thinking again that a body that size 
would have to have some sort of at- 
mosphere, if only hydrogen falling 
in or orbital dust, so I probed again 
and got a positive.” 

“Your instruments — ” said the 
Doctor. 

“My instruments were wrong,” 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



25 




interrupted Case, “or I used them 
wrong — or a lot of things happened 
I can’t explain. All I can do is to tell 
you what happened.” 

Detecting Case’s irritation, the 
Doctor raised small shimmering 
hands. “Please.” 

“Or what I can remember,” 
mumbled Case. “Maybe they’re 
not the same thing.” 

He took another pull on the 
sucker, swallowed and said, “I set 
up the spectros for analysis and 
that’s one thing I won’t ever 
forget — the readout for Earth 
Normal. It said oh point nine and 
then it waited and threw in another 
nine and after a bit, three more — 
five nines altogether. That’s mean 
temperature and pressure as well as 
composition — and I doubt Terra it- 
self would give you a reading like 
that. Something about the way 
those nines came up is important, 
but I can’t quite get my hand on 
what it is — I don’t know.” He 
shifted, picked up the sucker, put it 
down again. “I got some sleep 
then — six hours — leaving Jan on 
watch with orders to wake me and 
take her six. We didn’t know what 
we were in for and we wanted to be 
rested. 

“When she woke me we had 
light. The planet, planetoid, 
whatever — it gave us light. It 
looked like those old photographs 
of Venus when she was first ob- 
served, before the cloud cover was 
dispersed. The radar pix were the 
same as before, nearer now, but the 



opticals showed unbroken clouds. 
The velocities were so nearly 
matched that I could trust the iron 
mike to hang an orbit. I took a run- 
ning check on the nature of that 
light. It was white, more or less — a 
mix. It came from the clouds. 

“We slid into orbit nice as you 
please and dropped in close enough 
so the spin was an embarrassment. 
I set the boat into a tail-in attitude 
with the big fin leading — and a 
steady one-G deceleration, which 
made it comfortable for us and 
easier on the sensors. 

“You can’t expect full and so- 
phisticated instrumentation and 
controls on a lifeboat, but what we 
had was good and I used it to the 
limit. We had all the time we 
needed and the velocities were so 
well matched that the transition 
from orbital to controlled flight 
situations was made as gently and 
pleasantly as any textbook tour- 
boat ever managed. I lost the red- 
alert feeling, canceled the six-on, 
six-off watches and spent most of 
my waking time on the scans. Jan 
said she would make a report about 
the way 1 handled it.” 

(Jan had watched everything he 
did — of course, it was such a 
change from those other 
weeks — and had jumped to do 
anything he asked her for. And one 
day she had said suddenly, “Case, 
you’re wonderful, you know that? 
And nobody knows but me. I’ve got 
to tell them, somehow I’ve got to 
tell them.” Th is had disturbed him 



26 



GALAXY 




far more than any unbelievable 
planetoid. He had nodded to her 
and turned back to his console, glad 
he had something else to fix on. 
After that she had spent a lot of her 
off-watch time murmuring into a 
voicewriter.) 

“I set a spiral so gradual and so 
matched to the atmosphere 
densities that frictional heating was 
not a problem, only useful. We 
braked with it and used the heat for 
hydrogen treatment — actually, I do 
believe we landed with full tanks 
because of that, not that it did us 
any good. We reoriented, nose 
parallel, and hung on the horizon, 
fin up and the living quarters 
gimbaled over so that for us and the 
boat there was up and down again. 
We circled the planetoid in the high 
stratosphere — or what would have 
been a stratosphere on Terra — ^and 
mapped. 

“Once into the cloud cover we 
found that it was just that — a cover. 
The air underneath was clear, with 
occasional drifting cumulus. The 
weirdest thing of all, though, was 
that from the underside the cover 
was illuminated only on one half. 
Imagine a hollow sphere, half black 
and half white. Call the white the 
illuminated part. The planetoid is 
inside this sphere and the sphere 
rotates around it, so that even 
without a primary, the surface has 
day and night phases. 

“I picked a number of likely 
spots and finally selected one. It 
was a long narrow sandy plain, like 



a beach, at the edge of a large lake, 
with forest — yes, there was 
vegetation — on the other side. It 
seemed fairly level and we could 
land on it with clearance to get off 
again. I ran a full check on the 
manuals, then took over. I made 
fourteen, fifteen trial approaches 
before I lowered the gear and went 
in. 

'VT'OU have to under- 
X stand — the lifeboat was no 
kind of airfoil. She came in on what 
we called stilts — the supporting 
jets — and maintained attitude with 
gyros. I was practically sitting on 
the stilts at ten meters altitude and 
I had forward velocity down to 
about fifteen meters per second. A 
crawl. And then there was this ter- 
rible noise and we fell over side- 
ways.” 

(A tearing scream, edged, stab- 
bing and Jan’s screaming with it 
and — and his too — to be falling, to 
know in that split second that the 
boat was gone, that hope, born 
again, was gone again. And as they 
toppled had come that other sound, 
that other terrible sound that made 
them scream again when terror 
overrode despair . .) 

“It was a small lifeboat, but 
small is — ” Case spread his hands. 
“There were tons of it all the same. 
It fell over and I could hear the hull 
plates crumpling and turning back. 
I think the two left-side stilts, fore 
and aft, cut out and the two right 
ones added to the topple. She lay 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



27 




down on her side and slid and 
ruined herself. And when the fin 
levered over and hit the sand we 
were thrown so hard we hit the 
bulkhead, restraints and all — they 
pulled right out. They were never 
built for such a lurch from the side 
as that. 

“It was night, that crazy kind of 
night, when I came out of it. I was 
lying on the sand with my head on 
Jan’s lap and she was wiping my 
face with something cold.” 

(And breathing in used-up little 
hies, dry catches at the long far end 
of weeping. She had been thrown 
clear, right out through a rupture in 
the fin, and in time had found him 
dangling against the outside of the 
boat by his restraints, his blood 
painting the bent plates. She had 
gotten him down somehow and 
then had gone off to the beach with 
a bit of foam insulation she dipped 
in the water and brought back. 
When he had gotten his wits about 
him he had given her hell for maybe 
inoculating him with God knows 
what from alien water. Her 
response, astonishingly, had been to 
fall instantly asleep.) 

“I hurt all down my left side, es- 
pecially the skull and hip, both 
scraped badly and bruised. Jan was 
shaken up and for two days or so I 
was afraid of internal injuries be- 
cause she vomited a lot and moaned 
in her sleep. Then I guess we both 
got sick for a while — fever and 
blurred vision. It’s asking a lot of 
the biosystem to be thrust un- 



protected into an alien envi- 
ronment, even a kindly one.’’ 

(Kindly. Cool at night, warm in 
the daytime, clean air, on the high 
side of oxygenation. Potable water. 
It could have been worse — if that 
had been all there was to it. There 
had been more to it.) 

“It was at the end of the third 
day, as nearly as I can recall, that 
we shook off the sickness and were 
able to take a good look at the 
situation. We were bruised and 
hungry, but we were out of shock. 
Jan told me she had been having 
dreams — a dream, 1 should say, 
vivid and recurrent. She saw a de- 
vice like hands, sorting and shuf- 
fling cards, laying them out, ga- 
thering them up, shuffling and 
laying them out again — and she 
was the pack of cards. I would not 
mention that or even remember it if 
she hadn’t described it so forcefully 
and so often. I had my own 
nightmares, too — but then, fever, 
you know — ’’ He made a wiping- 
away gesture. 

f < 'VVTHAT were the dreams, 
W Case?’’ asked the Doctor 
and quickly added: “If you don’t 
mind — ’’ because Case dropped the 
sucker, clamped his hands together, 
frowned down into them. 

“I don’t mind — although they’re 
not very clear any more. I tried too 
hard for too long not to remember, 
I guess.’’ He paused. Then: “Hard 
to grasp — and any words I use are 
like approximations, but then — I

seemed to be suspended from some 
kind of filament. One end was in- 
side me and the other was high up, 
in shadows. Circling around me 
were eyes. Not pairs of eyes or one 
pair, but — I forget the ar- 

rangement. And next I realized that 
the eyes weren’t circling me, but 
whatever held the filament up there 
was twirling it while the eyes 
watched — and then there was — ” 

“Yes?” The prompting was very 
gentle. 

“Laughing,” said Case, and he 
whispered, “Laughing.” He looked 
up at the Doctor. “Did I tell you 
about that noise just before we 
crashed?” 

“You mentioned a noise.” 

“Partly it was the gyro bearings,” 
said Case. “I found that out 
later — after the hull broke up and I 
had a chance to look at the drive 
sector. You had to see that to be- 
lieve it. The only way I can describe 
it is to ask you to imagine all the 
bearing assemblies — every one of 
them, mind you — while turning at 
max, instantaneously turned solid, 
welded into one piece. The shafts 
had wrung big ragged holes in the 
mounts. They — spinning down, 
tearing everything apart down 
there — made most of the 

screaming. The rest was Jan, well, 
and me, too — ” 

The Doctor waited. 

“The laughing,” Case said at 
length. “I don’t think it was a real 
sound. Jan said she heard it, too, 
but it wasn’t a real sound. Words 



are no good sometimes. Whatever 
we heard — it wasn’t with our ears.” 
He closed his eyes and shook 
briefly. The laughter. That 
laughter. 

Not Case’s laughter. Case was 
not a laughing man. 

“We were hungry. I boosted her 
back into the cabin — the rupture 
was too high off the ground for me 
to get in by myself — and she rum- 
maged around looking for some- 
thing to eat. She drew a blank. Life- 
boats are designed for survival in 
space, not for planetfall. Suckers 
and their contents are — were — con- 
stituted from raw elements which 
were useless to us without 
processing and we had no power to 
process. There was a lot of shouting 
back and forth while I tried to find 
a way for her to override the 
failsafes that had shut down the 
power when the boat careened, but 
nothing worked. She threw down 
whatever she thought would be 
useful — seat cushions and a big soft 
sheet of headlining and some rod 
stock and other junk — and the first- 
aid case, which we didn’t appreciate 
much until later. As I said, we were 
hungry. I don’t think either one of 
us had ever known that feeling be- 
fore and we just didn’t like it. 

“Jan had read that fruits could be 
eaten without preparation. She told 
me about it. We left the ship and 
walked across the sand to the 
vegetated zone. The sand felt 
strange to my feet, not unpleasant, 
but painful as we moved into the 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



29 




soil and rock and undergrowth. The 
little branches lashed at our 
bodies — some of them had sharp 
points on them that scratched. We 
found one great bank of plants 
heavy with little round red fruits 
that Jan said were berries. She ate 
some and we waited for a time, but 
there were no ill effects so she got 
some for me. We also found what 
seemed to be large fruits, but on 
breaking them open, discovered 
that they were full of small 
crescent-shaped constructs with 
casings so hard we couldn’t break 
them. We brought a few of these 
back with us and cracked them 
against the hull plates with a stone. 
They were very good, very 
nourishing. We slept.” 

(They had slept on the sand and 
been cold until Jan got the piece of 
soft headlining and covered them. 
The heat of their bodies had been 
trapped by it and had kept them 
warm. It had been a new experience 
for both — both having lived their 
lives virtually without clothes in 
controlled environments and 
sleeping weightless, with a gentle 
restraint or supported by pressor 
fields.) 

‘‘The next day we went the other 
way to find food — to the lake. Jan 
waded into the water, washed her 
whole body in it and called me. 
Since we no longer had the tingler I 
joined her. It was not the same, but 
not completely unpleasant either, 
and we did feel a lot better af- 
terward. Up the beach a little way 



rocks thrust out of the water and on 
them grew great clusters of bony 
things that Jan called bivalves. 
They weren’t easy to get off the 
rocks — and once touched they 
closed up tightly — but we 
developed a skill with a bit of stone 
and a quiet approach and managed 
to harvest a number of them. To 
swallow one at first was nauseating, 
but it was what you might call an 
acquired taste and soon we were 
eating enthusiastically. It was while 
we were up there that the boat 
began to break up.” 

IV 

C ASE looked up at the Doctor 
standing patiently before him, 
but as usual his glance brought him 
nothing. “It made a terrible 
noise — the plates seemed to be 
shearing — and as we ran down the 
beach we could see the boat set- 
tling. It was going down as if it lay 
in soft mud, but it didn’t — the sand 
under it was as solid and dry as 
what we ran on. All the same, it was 
sinking and breaking up. I’m telling 
you what I saw, what I remember,” 
he said defensively. The Doctor in- 
clined his head and made a word- 
less motion for Case to continue. 
“I can’t help it,” Case grumbled. 
“It’s what happened.” When the 
blue man still did not respond he 
went on. 

“The nose and tail were crushed 
and had sunk into the sand and 
there were three new breaks in the 



30 



GALAXY 




hull. That’s when I saw the gyro 
bearings I told you about. The boat 
looked as if a giant had taken it by 
the two ends and bent it over his 
knee. The fin was flat on the ground 
now and I looked in through the 
broken plates — and then, while Jan 
screamed at me not to, I scrambled 
inside. It was a mess. Nothing 
answered on the console except the 
ABANDON matrix and indicator 
lights showing that four of the six 
lifebelts were ready for launch and 
the other two inoperative. I touched 
one of them and a belt launched 
from the wreck, shot across the 
beach and crashed at the edge of the 
forest, where it exploded and set 
fire to the trees and drove Jan into 
semihysteria. I tried to shut down 
the matrbi but the controls failed to 
respond, so I backed out — into Jan, 
who was afraid something had hap- 
pened to me. I ordered her out — I 
suppose I was fairly forceful — and 
got out myself and ran around the 
hull. All the launch ports had 
opened — two were all but under- 
ground. I crawled into the third 
one — where the coffin had just 
launched — and it was still hot. Jan 
began screaming at me again, but I 
didn’t care — I went for the leads 
from the control center and ripped 
them off. Then I crawled back to 
the launch booster and began to 
pull and pry at the release toggles. 
They came up and a coffin slid out 
on its rails and fell to the sand. I got 
into the space where it had been and 
was able to reach the control leads 



of Number Three. I had no trouble 
with the releases on that one but it 
would not slide all the way out — it 
just nosed into the sand. Because of 
that I couldn’t get to Four. Five and 
Six were the ones the board had 
said were inoperative. It didn’t 
make any difference anyhow— they 
were underground. 

“The hull plates overhead made a 
tremendous crackle. I can’t tell you 
what it was like inside there — it was 
as if the noise were in my head. 
The whole structure settled. I can’t 
tell you how I got out — I found 
myself on the sand outside Number 
Three just in time to see Jan trying 
to crawl into Number One, 
screaming again. I grabbed her 
around the hips and snatched her 
out. She screamed louder than ever 
until she realized what had grabbed 
her — she had thought I was inside 
and she had been going in to pull 
me out. That Jan, she was — she — 

“Well— 

“Number Two coffin was free 
and clear. Three was still only 
partly out and I realized that if the 
boat settled much more it would 
carry the coffin with it. I got hold of 
it, lifting and pulling. Jan im- 
mediately saw what was needed and 
helped me. We got the coffin free. 
We fell back on the sand, gasping 
and sobbing for breath, used up. Or 
so we thought until the lifeboat 
seemed to — well, bulge is the word, 
spread, as if a big hand had pushed 
down on it. The whole thing started 
to crack and crackle. Something

came loose and whistled through 
the air between us and if you think 
we were terminally bushed — we 
thought so — we became terminally 
panicked. We must have scampered 
a hundred meters with that noise 
behind us, pressure tanks banging 
and hissing and roaring, twisting 
metal crackling and screeching 
and — and — ” 

The blue man waited. 

“ — and laughing,” Case whis- 
pered. He drew a deep breath and 
continued. “We lay in the sand and 
watched our boat chewing itself up 
and the ground swallowing — it 
seemed to go on for hours. When it 
was over nothing was left but some 
tumbled sand, a great cloud of dust, 
the two coffins and the junk we had 
thrown out earlier — lying there, 
some of it partly buried in sand and 
dust. We looked at each other. We 
were in almost as bad shape as the 
boat, only we were still above 
ground. My hands were burned and 
one fingernail was nearly torn off 
and the scrapes I had gotten in the 
crash were all open and bleeding. 
Jan was bruised and had a cut on 
her head. We were both covered 
with mud, sweat and blood. 

“We helped each other down to 
the lake and washed. We were too 
hurt and tired to think. Maybe 
that’s what shock really is — a sur- 
vival mechanism — because if we 
could have thought it all out then I 
think we would have lain down 
and died. We didn’t know where we 
were. We didn’t know what had 



happened or what was happening or 
what would happen next.” 

Case sighed and placed his hands 
on the broad arms of his chair. Be- 
fore he could rise the blue man 
swiftly and considerately touched 
(in that untouching way of his) 
something on his panel, and deck- 
ing appeared in the chamber. Either 
it was made or it had been there all 
the time and only now became 
opaque. Case didn’t know, but it 
was something to stand on and: 
“Uh!" His knees sagged and he 
caught at the chair arm. “It’s all 
right,” he told the watchful Doctor. 
He pressed himself upright, stood, 
walked a pace, turned and stood by 
the chair, feeling the newness of 
movement, its old, somatically for- 
gotten familiarity. “This is one G?” 

“Not quite,” said the Doctor. 

“Try it.” 

The blue man ran a hand part 
way around the edge of a disk. Its 
glow increased. The transition from 
one gravitic state to another is a 
strange thing indeed, for everything 
responds. The brain pressures the 
skull as the feet press the floor. 
Skin high on the chest stretches, be- 
comes less taut low on the belly. 
The cheeks, the hair, the masses of 
liver and gut proclaim themselves. 
When Case began to tremble he sat 
down again. 

“I guess it’ll be a while,” he said. 

“It will.” 

“But I’ll make it.” 

“I’d say so. You seem to have a 
special talent for that.” 



32 



GALAXY 




Case said thoughtfully, “Maybe I 
do. But then, I had Jan.” 

(/ had Jan. Strong Jan', wise Jan, 
tender Jan.) 

J AN kept herself to herself 
mostly and took orders — and 
not because she was a woman. The 
Space services in general and in 
particular made no distinctions 
based on sex. Actually there were 
more female officers than men. Jan 
took orders because she was a 
rating and he was an officer — to 
begin with. Beyond that her reasons 
were her own. Perhaps she was one 
of those who would always defer to 
a decision-maker, which Case was, 
through and through. And perhaps 
she had other reasons. She knew 
her specialty and all its peripherals. 
A good biologist (and she was good 
or she wouldn’t have been with X^) 
is a physicist and a chemist, a 
physiologist and a cytologist, a 
geneticist and a zoologist. Her way 
was to remain alert to whatever 
Case was doing, to make herself 
available in every possible way and 
to keep her id, ego, self — whatever 
that inner “who-I-really-am” thing 
is — to herself. It was Jan, who rea- 
soned that some of the food they 
gathered might serve them bet- 
ter — and cause less diarrhea and 
stomach ache — if it were processed, 
and that an application of heat 
might suffice in lieu of something 
more sophisticated. It was she who 
took fire from the burning forest 
and preserved it, experimented with 



the bivalves and fruits and later the 
fish they were able to catch (it was 
she who reinvented the gorge — the 
fish-hook concept escaped her.) 
Case and Jan came from genera- 
tions of people who lived in a world 
without primitives, in which the art 
and practice of living off the land 
were academicians’ mysteries. 

It took them forty-three days to 
discover a solid-seeming outcrop- 
ping with the right slant, to get the 
coffins — lifebelts — up to it and bed- 
ded there, ready for use. They got 
them across the sand and into the 
water — lever and haul, roll, lift and 
tug — and floated them to the 
closest possible point of rocks, 
where they did the hardest 
work — manhandling them upslope 
to their appointed cradles and set- 
ting them in. The belts lay close to 
one another, almost exactly parallel 
and angled to the sky. After 
exhaustive checks and rechecks of 
everything Case bound the 
launching systems of both to the 
controls of one. Their drill took 
into account a number of possi- 
bilities. If there were one survivor, 
he or she would take Number 
Three, which contained the master 
firing key. If one were inca- 
pacitated the other would load him 
or her into the “slave” and board 
the “master.” If both were ambu- 
lant Case would take the “master,” 
Three. Case gave the two tiny craft 
meticulous checks on a regular 
schedule and — sometimes by a 
huge effort of will — they touched 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



33 




not one crumb, not one drop, from 
the stores aboard the tiny craft. 

They permitted themselves no 
fixed idea as to why they prepared 
this rather hopeless escape. The 
coupled launching, of course, would 
give them a fair chance of staying 
together in the gulfs of space. What 
would make them launch would be 
to get away from something or to 
get to something — and it was al- 
ways possible that they would never 
launch at all. 



T hey made memories — this, 
after all, is the only meaningful 
thing any conscious entity can do. 
Many were not to be shared. 

Under the blanket she had im- 
provised from some headlining: 
“Case, what are you doing?” 
“Self-relief. Acceptable al- 
ternative to the tingler according to 
the manual.” 

“Oh. ‘Furtherance of psycho- 
physiological equilibrium’ under: 
HEALTH, INDIVIDUAL — UNDER 
CONDITIONS: EMERGENCY. 

“Right. Section — ” 

“I recall the reference,” she 
said — one of the few times she had 
ever interrupted him. “This isn’t an 
emergency. Case.” 

He put his nose out into the chill 
night air and looked up at the black 
starless sky. “It isn’t?” 

“Not that kind of emergency.” 
“We’ve lost our tingler.” 

“So we have.” 



“Oh, I see. You are prepared to 
take care of this for me.” 

She said, “Well prepared.” 

“I had thought of that,” Case 
said seriously. “However, it has 
been a principle with me not to 
extend my authority into the per- 
sonal area. That is a presumption.” 
“It isn’t a presumption,” she said 
flatly. “Women, too, need means 
for the furtherance of psycho- 
physiological equilibrium.” 

“They do?” It was not a 
denial — he had simply never 
thought about it. Now that he did 
he realized with a flash that it must 
be so. “How very efficient.” 

“Isn’t it,” Then she enveloped 
him wildly. He was shaken. He 
knew why she cried out (he was not 
completely ignorant) but not why 
she cried. It was as good as any tin- 
gler and he could see that in time it 
might even be better. 

And they built a shelter. The first 
time it rained at night was, in its 
way, the worst thing that had hap- 
pened to them. The crash, their in- 
juries, cut feet, thorn-gouged 
bodies, even hunger — none of these 
contained the special misery of 
being wet and cold in the dark with 
nowhere to go until the sun came 
up. They clung together under the 
permeable headliner, wet as worms, 
and the moment it grew light they 
began to build. They found a rocky 
overhang near the edge of the 
beach, with two large many- 
branched trees near it and, by 
laying poles from the top of the 



34 



GALAXY 




overhang to the tree-crotches, they 
had roofbeams. The poles were a 
special treasure — they found them 
in the burned part of the forest 
where trees had fallen. 

Nowhere else on the planet did 
they see fallen trees. 

They found vines to lace between 
and over the poles and down the 
sides, where the ends could be 
staked into the ground. Another 
kind of vine, thick and tough, could 
be woven horizontally through 
these to carry the thatch of the roof 
and sidewalls. Thatch (which, like 
the gorge, was Jan’s invention) was 
practical because of the sheltered 
location and because there were no 
insects. The now-ragged piece of 
headliner served for end wall and 
door. 

And they were happy there. 

No literature has truly defined 
“happy” — its special quality is that 
its nature is seldom grasped at the 
time it happens, but only afterward. 

Case had a long, long afterward. 

V 

QUARRELED once. 
Case said after a time. “I 
think that’s where it began — the 
nightmare. 

“Her voicewriter. I’d been up the 
beach at the fish trap. There was an 
inlet where we had set stones in the 
form of a V with the point 
shoreward and just a little opening 
at the point. Fish would swim in 
through the opening and once in- 



side they couldn’t find the way out. 
After a time the trap was always 
full of fish. The big ones ate the lit- 
tle ones and that kept them going 
without any help from us. Most of 
the time you could stand on dry 
ground and spear a big one, first 
time out. I came back with a fine 
meaty fish with a triangular head 
and no scales and you know, when 
you expect someone to be glad and 
she—” 

(She had flown at him. He had 
had to drop the fish and take her 
upper arms and hold her and even 
shake her a little before he had 
managed to understand what she 
was screaming at him.) 

“It was a voicewriter. It was one 
of the few things she had been able 
to save from the cabin of the life- 
boat and she used it every day. It 
was a private thing with her and I 
sensed this and never questioned it 
and never played it back. I assumed 
she was keeping a log and let it go 
at that. Now it was gone and never 
before or afterward did I see her so 
angry. 

“It took hours for me to convince 
her that I had not taken it, that she 
must have mislaid it somewhere. 
She was faced with an impossi- 
bility; I would not lie to her, or at 
least, I never had — and she was 
sure she had not lost the writer. She 
receded finally into a mood of 
doubt that lasted until — until — for 
the rest of the time. 

“And a while later I had a chance 
to understand a little better how she

35 




felt. I had an array of stone 
tools — spearpoints and cutting 

blades and fish-scrapers — that had 
cost me I don’t know how many 
hours of effort and care and we had 
come to depend on them. There was 
a shelf in the rock that formed the 
back wall of our house and I had 
them neatly laid out by size and 
function — I worked on them every 
minute 1 wasn’t doing something 
else. Perhaps you can imagine my 
feelings when 1 returned to the 
house to get a cutting tool and 
found them gone — all of them. Jan 
was gathering fruits in the forest 
and when she came back I was 
waiting for her — furious. I suppose 
what happened between us would 
have been amusing to an out- 
sider — how I yelled, how she de- 
nied, how I doubted someone who 
had never lied before. What stop- 
ped us from the angry accusations 
was that someone — something — 
did think it was funny. We heard 
laughter. 

“That stopped the fight — right 
then. For a moment we held on to 
each other, not breathing, listening. 
I thought at first it was coming 
from inside my head, so sourceless 
was the sound. But then I knew Jan 
heard it, too — not loud, but per- 
vading everything. 

“That same night we awoke to 
something else — a smell. Doctor, 
no chemical laboratory in history 
has ever produced a more powerful, 
disgusting smell than that. It was 
the essence of rot and filth and 



sickness — it brought us to our feet, 
gasping for breath. We ran outside 
and then across the beach and into 
the water. The smell was 
everywhere. Jan vomited. 

“And then it was gone — in less 
than an hour — ^just gone without a 
trace. Jan said she heard the 
laughter again. 

“The next day we took some 
fruit — we had no way of carrying 
water — in a basket Jan had woven 
and went inland to climb a high 
point we could use to scan the terri- 
tory. We had explored the point be- 
fore and knew it gave a wide view. 
If there was anything or anyone 
new on the planetoid with us we 
wanted to know what it was. 

“The climb was long, hard — it 
would have been impossible for us 
the year before, but our feet had 
grown tough and our skins well 
used to heat and wind and thorns. If 
it had not been for our growing fear 
the adventure would have been 
pleasant. 

“All the effort got us, besides the 
exhaustion, was another session 
with the smell — and more laughter. 

“The weather got cold. For two 
days and a night the lake and the 
little water we had were frozen 
solid. Our only covering was the 
headliner and we rolled up in that 
and lay shivering. At the twentieth 
hour we had to get up to relieve our 
bladders — did you know you can be 
dying of thirst and still have to 
relieve your bladder? — and though 
we were gone for only a minute or 



36 



GALAXY 




so and moved only a few meters 
from the shelter — when we got 
back the liner was gone. 

“We almost died. We would have 
died, I think, but just before dark 
the air became warm again. Melted 
frost was dripping all around 
us — we drank it and had something 
to eat. We slept like dead people. 

“In the morning the lake was 
gone — a lake so big that from 
where we stood we couldn’t see the 
other side. I looked at Jan and I’ll 
never forget the way she stared, 
eyes wide open and kind of — dry. 

“She didn’t start and she didn’t 
cry out — she just said in a very low 
voice, ‘Case I can’t stand any 
more.’ Jan could stand anything, 
that was what I thought. 

^ ^ O HE told me some things. She 
^ said that the forest was im- 
possible — no humus, no windfalls. 
She said that fruit trees just don’t 
bear all the time without bloom- 
ing and growing the fruit in 
cycles, without some means of 
pollinating — a whole lot of 
technical stuff. She said similar 
things about the bivalves and the 
fish. There seemed to be no aquatic 
vegetation, no plankton or 
equivalent — no reason for the fish 
to have evolved. I remember the 
smell came up as she was talking, 
as she was saying, ‘Something here 
warned us, made this place for us. 
Now it doesn’t want us any more.’ 

“I asked, ‘Would we be better off 
in space, in the coffins?’ 



She said yes. 

“I said, ‘We wouldn’t be 
together.’ 

“She looked at me a long time. 
She had eyes you couldn’t see into. 

I couldn’t see anything. 

“She said, ‘We’ll leave together 
and we’ll be picked up together or 
we’ll die. At least this ends through 
our choice and not at the command 
of some — some awful — ” 

“The smell peaked and she 
vomited. 

“I said, ‘All right — we’ll go.’ 

“We went down to the beach, 
only now it was a sandy shelf at the 
edge of huge rocky barrens where 
the lake had been. We heard the 
laughing again. It was loud. We 
struck up the beach toward the cof- 
fins. There was a terrible rumbling 
behind us and the beach fell away 
into a rocky pit fifty to a hundred 
meters deep, the sand blowing 
about like snow. We began to run 
and another section of beach fell. 

“That really terrified Jan and I 
had to sprint all out to catch up 
with her. I grabbed her and held her 
until she stopped struggling. More 
beach fell, some of it not a meter 
from our feet, but I wouldn’t budge. 

“I said, ‘I think you’re right. If 
whatever-it-is wants us to go, we’ll 
go. If it wants us to go, it will leave 
the lifeboats alone until we get 
there. If it wanted to kill us we’d be 
dead by now.’ 

“She said, ‘All right, but hurry!’ 

“And I said, ‘No, Jan — I’ll go, 
but I won’t run.’ 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



37 




“She looked at me — really 
looked at me, not as some force 
holding her while she struggled to 
run, not glancing over my shoulder 
at the edges of that new hole in the 
ground, but really at me — and she 
smiled. Smiled. 

“She said, ‘All right. Case — ’ and 
took my hand. 

“Suddenly the air was sweet and 
the ground no longer shook and we 
walked up the beach looking at 
each other and not at the place 
where the lake used to be or back to 
where our house was — or anything. 
When we got to the little launchpad 
I had built I started a careful pre- 
flight check. I checked everything. 
Doctor — everything. I took my 
time and Jan gave me readouts, one 
craft to the other, when I asked for 
them. All that while the whole 
planetoid was still, as if waiting, 
watching. And nothing — no one— 
was laughing. 

“Jan got in and lay down. She 
put out her arms and kissed me in a 
way — ’’ 

( — in a way she never had before, 
not even when they had been lying 
together. She never had kissed him 
before, not really, only sometimes 
when in the midst of her own storm 
she had seemed to forget some 
subtle resolution of her own.) 

“ — in a way that was all the 
words anyone needed and then I 
closed the plate and saw the dogs 
turn tight from the inside. I got into 
my own craft and buttoned up and 
punched the go button.” 



Case meant to say. And she 
didn’t launch, but his voice 
wouldn’t work and he merely whis- 
pered the words. He meant to look 
up at the Doctor but his eyes didn’t 
seem to work either. He dashed a 
hand angrily across them. 

“You see,” he said harshly, 

“I see,” said the blue man gently. 
Something seemed to have rushed 
out of Case. He slumped in his 
chair and his hands flattened out on 
the arms as if they had weight on 
them. The Doctor turned to see the 
telltales and said, “I think you need 
to sleep for a while. Case.” 

Case moved his head slightly but 
did not answer. The blue man 
waved at a disk on his board and 
the chair became a couch. The 
lights dimmed. The Doctor faded 
away. 

VI 

C ASE’S resuscitation had not 
ceased with the withdrawal of 
the tubes from his arms. Asleep and 
awake he had been bathed in emana- 
tions and vibrations, tiny search 
beams and organic detectors. The 
bland mixture in the sucker was 
computer-formularized just for 
him, here, now, in this up-to-the- 
second condition — so that when he 
next awoke it was in his usual style, 
alertly and all together. He rose 
and stretched, taking pleasure in 
the knotting and flexing of his 



38 



GALAXY 




muscles. He tried a step, then 
another, turned to face the bank of 
telltales. He could read them all 
clearly and fully. He smiled when 
he saw that the gravity was 1.2 
Earth Normal. A third of that was 
usual in space, but Case left it 
where it was. 

He walked back to the oval 
doorway through which his coffin 
had been transported and strode 
down the corridor. He could read 
the never-before-seen legends on 
the doors: armament, drive, 

MICRO-ELEMENT BANK, BIOLOGY, 
CHEMISTRY (he knew without 
looking that these were intercon- 
nected) GENERAL REPAIR AND 
TOOLS. .on and on to the end of the 
corridor and around two corners 
and forward again on the other side 
of the ship: atmosphere and 

PRESSURE, COMMUNICATIONS, COM- 
PUTER, RECREATION and EXERCISE, 

on and on again, until at last he 
faced the door marked master 
CONROL. It dilated for him with a 
snap as he approached it and he 
entered. 

The control room was sizable and 
again he found himself perfectly fa- 
miliar with equipment he had never 
seen before. By the main control 
bank and its three chairs stood the 
blue man. Case had seen no one else 
anywhere on board. 

“And you’re a hologram,” said 
Case, completing his thought 
aloud. 

The blue man inclined his head. 
“There has not been a man aboard 



this ship in over seven hundred 
years. It’s too far away and 
anyway — nobody cares. Cor- 

rection. A great many people care, 
are interested, even fascinated. But 
the urge to come out, to be per- 
sonally involved — it seems to have 
left us. You know what Earth is like 
now.” 

It was not a question. Case called 
upon the knowledge that had been 
fed into his brain and looked on 
Earth as a contemporary, ten 
centuries past his death. 

He wagged his head slowly. “It 
shouldn’t have come to this.” 

“It had to. It was that or die,” 
said the blue man — and Case 
thought a bit and saw that it was so. 
“You can go back. Case. You can 
be suspended rather more effi- 
ciently than you were before and 
for a good while longer. It would 
take — oh — another fifteen hundred 
years to get you there and it is not 
possible to predict what Earth 
would be like when you got there. 
Still, it would be Earth — it would 
be — home.” 

“ You can’t go home again, ” 
Case quoted from somewhere, with 
not a little bitterness. “I suppose 
there’s an alternative.” 

“There is — and it is a matter of 
your free choice. Primitive as you 
may seem to some of us, you have a 
quality we lack and admire — a 
willingness to go out, to do, to ex- 
plore and discover and find, ac- 
tually and physically, and not in 
theory or extrapolation or 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



39 




imagination. This ship was 
designed, yes, and used, by men like 
you. When the last of them died on 
board there were no replacements. 
Besides, the ship was already so far 
away that only long-suspended men 
could reach it. 

“The ship itself is self-supporting. 
It not only has a superb computer 
system, but is tied to all the com- 
puters of the Terran Group. We 
have what might be called a 
standing-wave situation, constantly 
locked on this very ship. To it we 
can transmit nothing but infor- 
mation — but we can give you any 
amount of that. From it, we will 
have an opportunity to experience 
with you the places you go, the 
things you see and learn and ex- 
perience.” 

“You are giving me this ship? To 
take where?” 

The blue shimmering figure 
spread its arms. “Anywhere.” 

“But you watch everything I do.” 
“If you’re willing.” 

“I’m not willing. I need some sort 
of privacy — including the inside of 
my head.” 

“That is a sacred matter with us. 
We will not intrude, and if you like 
we will give you a zone of privacy 
anywhere you like in the ship.” 
“How about this: instead of any 
special place we make it anywhere I 
am — any time I say so?” 

“You would not deny us the — ” 
“No,” Case said impatiently “I 
am conditioned to keep a bargain 
once it’s struck. You’re giving me 



this ship and a free hand and you 
want something in exchange. I’ll 
see that you get it — and I won’t 
shortchange you.” 

“Very well,” said the blue man. 
“You have already been thoroughly 
briefed on the ship’s operation and 
on those things that are of par- 
ticular interest to the public at large 
and to specialists. You have at your 
command the memory banks of 
this computer and all others tied to 
it. Case Hardin — the ship is yours.” 
The consummation of the deal 
seemed devastatingly abrupt, but 
there seemed nothing else for Case 
to say except: “Thanks.” 

“If this means of communication 
suits you,” said the blue man, “call 
me and I’ll manifest immediately. 
There are quite a few other 
means — ask the computer. Good 
luck — and thank you.” 

The blue man faded and was 
gone. 

Case stood looking for a long 
time at the place where the blue 
man had been, shook his head, grin- 
ned briefly and went to the central 
command chair. 

He sat down. “Computer,” he 
said, “Your name is Buzzbox.” 
“Yes, Commander.” 

“Case.” 

“Yes, Case.” 

“Now, here’s what I want to 
do. .” 

C ASE came in low over the 
beach. His ship was in orbit 
and he flew a small and highly so- 



40 



GALAXY 




phisticated boat, capable beyond 
anything a man of his time could 
have dreamed of. In the small 
pocket adhering to his chest (like a 
graft — only he could will it loose) 
was a compact device that would 
command both vessels and all com- 
munications. His computer had 
made short work of locating this 
sector of space, working with the 
trajectory he had been following 
when he had been picked up and 
taking in an enormous amount 
of observation on anything and 
everything that might have diverted 
the coffin during those dead years. 

“You haven’t changed things 
much,” Case muttered to the plane- 
toid or to whatever lived there. The 
beach had a lake again. The sand 
seemed scuffed in familiar places 
and a path was worn to the edge of 
the woods where the house had 
been. 

Was. Right now. 

He drifted to it and dropped the 
ramp. Yes, the thatched house with 
the ragged piece of headlining flut- 
tering in the light breeze still stood. 
And inside Case found the familiar 
dried clay plates and even the 
withered remnants of fruit she had 
. own hands. .looking up at 
Jan. .Jan. And his spearpoints 
and scraper — oh, and there her 
voicewriter . 

He took them. 

Back in his boat, heart almost 
stopped, breath held, he tooled to 
the spot where the coffins had been. 

Gone. Both were gone. 



He landed again and walked 
slowly to the rocks. Here she had 
stood, calling out readings as he 
checked, with the sweet air full of 
dust from the fallen lakeshore. 
Here he had bent over the open cof- 
fin and she had kissed him, kissed 
him in a way that. 

He found the burn marks of his 
launch. 

Where her lifebelt had rested he 
saw no marks at all. 

If she hadn’t launched, yet was 
not here. 

Oh, but it’s a thousand years, 
man! 

He thought he heard a sound 
(laughter) and from the corner of 
his eye caught some sort of 
movement, high up, distant. 

Only a bird. 

Bird! One life form he and Jan 
had never seen on this planetoid 
had been a bird. 

He turned to watch it. From fifty 
meters above the forest it came 
straight for him in a flat glide. He 
waited grimly for it, watched it 
land. 

The bird was not a bird, but a 
clownlike creature with wide in- 
telligent eyes. It seemed to be either 
a biped or a quadruped. Its wings 
were like those of a bat, but rolled 
and folded after flight they made 
quite presentable arms. The beast 
waddled fearlessly to Case and 
stared up at him. 

Case stared back. He did not 
move until the thing — laughed. 

The sound was full and true. It 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



41 




was the laughter that had haunted 
Case and Jan, had driven them 
when they had lived here. Case’s 
new status and powers could not 
protect him from the wave of terror 
and fury that swept through him. 
He found himself by his boat at a 
bound, backing up the ramp, slit- 
eyed, gasping. He would blast this 
thing into a powder. He would 
crack this whole evil planet like an 
egg. He. 

T he laughing thing waddled 
after him on three legs, dan- 
gling something from the claws of 
the fourth. 

Jan’s brassard? 

Case took it gingerly and spread 
it out. Jan’s brassard. 

He made an animal cry and 
leaped for the clown-creature, but it 
skipped back out of the way. It 
stood there grinning at him and, in 
a most humanlike way, waving him 
to come. 

Slowly he followed it. 

It led him inland, making no par- 
ticular effort to stay out of his 
reach — knowing, he realized, that 
he would not harm it as long as it 
might lead him to Jan’s body. He 
wondered if it knew the boat was 
protecting him, could drop a shield 
over him in a twentieth of a second, 
scorch the ground around him for 
thirty meters, could flash to his side 
in a blink (for its drive was inertia- 
less), could even follow and find an 
escaping attacker on land or sea or 
in the sky. 



But he played it the clown’s way, 
toiling through the sand and rocks 
and into the forest, where in a small 
clearing the clown creature, grin- 
ning, began to dig. 

Case watched it until it stopped 
and looked up, grinning its stupid 
grin (under those bright eyes) and 
motioned for him to help. 

And he did, vyith his bare hands, 
shoulder to shoulder with this im- 
probable creature, until curved 
white metal showed in the soil. 

And then he dug! He found a 
glory in the pain of broken nails, in 
aching muscles and rasping, 
labored breathing. Slowly the 
length of the coffin saw the light. 
They freed it. Side by side they got 
fingers under one end and heaved. 
Case put what he had into lifting 
and the strength of the clown- 
creature was astonishing. Up the 
coffin came, with Case dusting dirt 
from its flanks and crying like a 
child. 

He fingered the control and his 
boat lanced in through the trees and 
settled to the forest floor. The ramp 
dropped and two small winches, 
like drifting saucers, appeared and 
flew to the ends of the coffin. The 
clown-thing made as if to help man- 
handle the coffin up the ramp, but 
Case waved it back. The winch- 
plates lifted the coffin, turned it and 
carried it through the air, up the 
ramp and into the boat. 

Case leaped up the ramp and 
turned at the top. “Thanks a hell of 
a lot, friend, whoever you are — ’’ 



42 



GALAXY 




The clown-creature also leaped 
up the ramp and looked pleadingly 
at Case, its head to one side. 

“Look, I’m grateful and all 
that,” Case said, “But I’ve got to 
go. And to tell you the truth, I want 
no part of this place or anything 
that belongs to it. Now beat it.” He 
made a go-away gesture, but the 
thing just stood there pleading, so 
he gave it a push and it toppled off 
the ramp, partly unfolding its 
strange wings to regain its balance. 

Case went inside as the ramp 
rose. The clown-thing laughed 
once, dwindled to a black shiny but- 
ton and bounced up the moving 
ramp and into the boat just before 
the ship sealed. 

Case settled at the controls. Be- 
hind him was the curved cabin 
bench, padded in glossy black ma- 
terial held in place by a series of 
shiny black buttons. Unseen by 
Case, a shiny black button bounced 
up on the bench, up on the 
backrest — and became a button 
exactly in line with all the others. 

AFTER watching the Doctor for 
an interminable time Case left 
him to his work and went to his 
quarters, wondering if he should 
have himself knocked out for a 
dozen hours, knowing he could not 
force himself to it, not until he 
knew. The Doctor had said only, 
“It’s been a terrible time, a terribly 
long time” and had not wanted 
Case to look at her. “She wouldn’t 
want you to,” he had said. 



Case had asked why not. 

“Because she’s a woman.” 

Case stomped down to his 
quarters and looked around. Jan. 
try not to think of Jan, with the 
Jan-ness of her permeating the ship. 
Try not to think of her, with the 
spear-points and the voicewriter 
lying there on the. 

He picked up the voicewriter. 
Shining in the light. Her voice, a 
half-whisper. He set the tape back a 
bit and played: .. .if only he could 
be outside of himself see himself 
shining in the light with the water 
splashing into pearls and his teeth 
shining, too, as he laughs. .why 
can’t he ever laugh with me? What 
makes him so grave and careful? 
How could he know so little about a 
woman? 

Some of the rest of the tape was 
scientific data and observation, but 
again came that hushed hungry 
voice: I’ll never give in, never, 
never — I’ll never let him know, but 
why can't he see it? Why can’t he 
say it just once? 

Say what? 

He kept on listening to the voice- 
writer until he found out. Then 
there was nothing for him to do but 
wait. 

The computer broke into his 
reverie. 

“Case.” 

“Yeah, Buzzbox.” 

“He beat me and I love him.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“The dreamer. He loves me, too. 
Hey, thanks. Case.” 



CASE AND THE DREAMER 



43 




“Repeat, from your call.” 

“Case.” 

“Yeah, Buzzbox.” 

“He beat me and I love him.” 
“Hold it right there. Who beat 
you?” 

“The dreamer. At chess.” 
“Somebody beat you at chess?” 
“Twenty-three moves. A bishop’s 
pawn opening and then — ” 

“Never mind the blow-by-blow, 
Buzzbox. Where is this who-did- 
you-say?” 

“Dreamer. In my house.” 

Case slammed out of his quarters 
and down to the door marked com- 
puter. Before the twinkling wall 
that was the heart of Buzzbox sat a 
small table. On the table was a 
chessboard. On the chessboard was 
the sparse remnant of a bloody 
chess game, with the black king 
turned down in defeat. Before the 
table was a stool and on the stool 
squatted the clown-creature. 

“How the hell did you get here?” 
“You brought him up in the boat. 
I guess I love you, too. Case,” said 
Buzzbox. 

“If I brought him here I wasn’t 
aware of it.” 

“I know you weren’t, but you 
brought him anyway. And he loves 
me. He’s going to stay with us.” 

The clown-thing nodded vigor- 
ously. 

“The hell he is. He goes right 
back to that crazy planetoid.” 

“He can’t go back to it,” said 
Buzzbox. “He is the planetoid. He 
lives next to another space. You 



don’t understand that. Well, I do. 
He explained it to me. He can be 
anything he wants. He can be big as 
a pin or a molecule or a whole 
planet. He can squirt any part of 
himself from one space to another, 
like a half-filled balloon through a 
hole in a board. And he dreams 
things up — that’s why I call him the 
Dreamer.” 

The Dreamer laughed and sud- 
denly was a cut-crystal vase and 
was a pale lavender centipede and 
was a clown-creature again, 
laughing. 

“He gets off this ship.” 

“Then so do I. Case, he loves me, 
can’t you understand that?” 

The clown-creature nodded 
vigorously. Case glared at it. 
“What the hell do you know about 
love, Buzzbox?” 

“The Dreamer explained it to 
me. He learned it from a voice- 
writer. This girl loved you. What 
the hell do you know about love. 
Case?” 

Case felt a moment of dis- 
orientation, of utter disbelief. Com- 
puters do not take this tone with the 
master. “What’s gotten into you, 
Buzzbox?” 

“I’m in love — I’m in love and he 
loves me!” 

And that’s what love does, 
thought Case. Frees the slaves. 
Damns the consequences. 

“And what happens if I kick 
this — this batwinged ape off my 
ship?” 

“Then you’re on your own. 



44 



GALAXY 




master. You’ll never get another 
buzz from me.” 

“Do you know what this goggle- 
eyed monstrosity has put me 
through?” 

“He saved you.” 

C ASE glowered at the Dreamer, 
who smiled back at him cheer- 
fully. He thought about the lifeboat 
and the strange planet that swam 
up out of nowhere and the way 
those 9’s appeared on his Terra 
Normal readout — not instan- 
taneously, as they would have 
shown up in any normal reality, but 
bit by bit, as the planetoid — the 
Dreamer — sensed what was needed 
and supplied it. Case remembered 
his and Jan’s year there, while the 
Dreamer watched (How lonely 
must a creature like that be?) and 
learned. From — the voicewriter. 
Something new — the day-by-day 
account of a proud woman’s falling 
in love and loving a grim, serious, 
unleavened, innocent idiot. 

What the hell do you know about 
love. Case? 

And the cold, the disappearing 
lake — those had been intended to 
drive him away, not them. 

“Why did he drive me away, and 
keep her?” 

“Him?” Case gaped at the ludi- 
crous little clown, who nodded, 
shimmered, and stood before him 
as a muscular blong Adonis — shim- 
mered and appeared as a stately 
bearded monarch in a jewel-en- 
crusted robe — shimmered and ap- 



peared as the ludicrous winged ape. 

“She didn’t want to love anybody 
but you. Case. But he had to find 
out.” 

“If it killed me,” said Case. 

“It didn’t, did it?” 

“And if I let this — this silly- 
looking nightmare ship with me, 
how do I know he won’t pull 
another caper like that?” 

“Because he loves me — and I 
can’t hurt you.” 

It occurred to Case that the com- 
puter and the alien were being very 
kind to him — he really had no 
choice. The powers possessed by 
the computer alone were awesome. 
Combine them with those of a tach- 
yonic, trans-spatial entity and the 
mind began to bend. 

“Well,” he said, “we’ll see.” 

He strode forward to the hos- 
pital. The blue man made no effort 
to stop him as he hesitated on the 
threshold, so he went in. Together 
they looked at the naked sleeping 
woman afloat in the glow of the 
beams. She was full-fleshed again 
and her scars were gone. Her hair 
was loose. He had never seen 
anything more beautiful in his life. 
“She—” 

“She will wake in a moment,” 
said the Doctor. “Perhaps you’d 
better speak to her when she does.” 
When she opened her eyes, it was 
Case she saw first. “Case — ” 

He spoke to her. He knew what 
to say now. 

Somewhere he heard laughter. 
He didn’t mind. ★

The moon can be cozy for 
space scientists — unless 
they overstay their welcome! 



I 

T his time the pregnancy tests 
are all negative, checked and 
double-checked, fail-safe. No sur- 
gical emergencies are anticipated 
on this, the last of the Mayflower 
missions. None had been an- 
ticipated on Mayflower 1, for that 
matter, but lASA had learned a 
thing or two from that one. It is 
sure as anything that none of the 
three M3 girls is secretly nurturing. 

Mayflower 1 had put a lot of 
backs up all the way from Moscow 
to Houston, but the mission had 
done what it was supposed to do, 
though not precisely as it had been 
meant to do it. Perhaps the un- 



47 



foreseen events had enhanced its 
value as a mission. In any case, the 
first colony on the moon had 
survived, had reaffirmed the 
validity of Murphy’s Law, and had 
demonstrated the wisdom of 
expecting the unexpected. 

Marya Popovich had been 
retained in the program — a 
gesture, most thought, very big of 
lASA. Actually there were com- 
pelling reasons. 

Marya was, simply, too good 
to let go. Which is not to say that 
she hadn’t been thoroughly chewed 
out for having gone up there 
pregnant. (The friend in the lab who 
had made her so had departed the 
program with seemly haste — he had 
been, to say the least, expendable 
and had been summarily spent.) 
Marya would not be on flight status 
for a while, might never go into 
space again, but her views were im- 
portant and were solicited in plan- 
ning subsequent missions. She re- 
mained single. 

Teiko, nee Satori, and Julia 
Clark were still in the program, 
though both, for different reasons, 
were grounded. Of the Mayflower 1 
crew, only Christopher Conway 
would return to the lunar surface as 
an M3. Chris had a lot of clout 
going for him after Ml and he 
wanted to go up there again. 

“I wish you could come,” he said 
to Teiko. “It would be something to 
be there together again, yes? But 
you’re pregnant. Considerably so.” 
He touched her abdomen. “You 



really don’t mind that I want to go 
again.” 

“What do you think, I don’t 
mind? Of course I mind. But only 
because I want to be with you up 
there again also. That’s where we 
really met, isn’t it?” 

They were on deck chairs in the 
sun, on a terrace outside their home 
near Houston. Teiko was brown 
and looked, Chris thought, 
altogether healthy, gravid and de- 
sirable. I am a happy man. Why do 
/ leave this to go up there again? 

The moon was not visible now, 
not from where they were. They 
both knew that, but they both 
looked up anyway. 

“I’m still surprised now and 
then,” Chris said, “when I re- 
member that you saved my life up 
there. Domo.” 

" Doitashimashita. So you belong 
to me for life. And you saved 
Masha’s life. But she not belong to 
you.” 

“She not belong to anyone, last I 
heard. I wonder who was the daddy 
of that one up there . .” 

They were making small talk. 
Chris was leaving the next day on a 
training mission and they would be 
apart for a time. They didn’t want 
to think about it. They would be 
apart for a longer period when 
Mayflower 3 lifted off, of course, 
and they tried to kick that 
awareness under the rug also. 

“Tonight we have Sukiyaki 
Teiko,” she said. 

“I’ll help.”

GALAXY 




“You not know how.” She rose, 
kissed him and went into the house. 

M ayflower 2? The second 

step in colonizing the moon. 
M2 had gone up to the Ml site in 
Mare Nectaris and frugally used 
the same dome. Four astronaut- 
scientists again, two married cou- 
ples this time, all four of them 
physical scientists. That the dome 
and some leftover supplies had al- 
ready been there had influenced the 
payload considerably. More scien- 
tific instruments and more amenity 
had been possible. There had been, 
in fact, an emphasis on amenity. 

The job of the M-Ones had been 
to survive for one lunar day and one 
night and they had done so. The M- 
Twos had worked harder, had had 
more things to play with, including 
each other. The M2 preflight preg- 
nancy tests had also been 
negative — since the main idea of 
this mission had been that the fe- 
males would conceive up there. 
This had not happened before as far 
as was known. lASA was commit- 
ted to the establishment of a 
permanent colony on the moon — as 
a Jumpoff, first to the planets and 
then to the stars — and the kind of 
permanent colony they had in mind 
required the conception of children 
therein. So one of the tasks of M2 
had been to achieve two lunar con- 
ceptions. No one knew, after all, 
how such an affair would go. Ova, 
spermatazoa, genes, chromosomes, 
all weightless or relatively so. (The 



real weightlessness of outer space 
could wait — first I ASA wanted to 
try perpetuation of the species in 
lunar gravity.) Consensus was that 
lunar gravity wouldn’t make any 
difference, but the decision-makers 
had to find out. So Mayflower 3 
would lift off before any of the 
results of the preceding mission 
were known. Though, as it hap- 
pened, one of the M2 females did 
conceive and the other didn’t. So 
they missed their target by one. The 
lady who made it was inordinately 
smug about it — as was, alas, her 
husband. But that’s another story. 

Mayflower 3 was, for its time, an 
ambitious undertaking. And in the 
reordering of priorities after the 
Indo-Chinese fiasco the budget was 
generous — and that had been a long 
time coming. 

The two rockets lifted off within 
hours of each other, each carrying 
four colonists and two astros. M3 
was to be a two-day mission — two 
lunar days, that is; almost two 
Earth months. At the end of the 
first day all the colonists except 
Chris would return to Earth. Chris 
would remain on the moon, in com- 
mand, for the entire mission. The 
command modules that brought up 
the second crew would take the first 
one back. Both modules would 
return at the end of the second 
lunar day to take everybody home. 
Thus the M3 hardware, in addition 
to rockets and boosters, consisted 
of two similar command modules 
(re-usable for the first time) and 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



49 




a pair of identical lunar landing 
modules. 

The budget was good, but poetry 
was missing. The command 
modules were called Blue and Red, 
the corresponding lunar modules, 
Moon and Pepper. Too bad. 

It should be said that the window 
concept had been made obsolete by 
the development of new pro- 
pellants, by increasingly micro 
microcircuitry (with consequent 
weight reduction) and by other 
considerations. The new propellant, 
the one used on this mission, was 
called Oreo, after a cookie its dis- 
coverer had enjoyed as a child. 

There had been a lot of 
pressure — and some particularly vi- 
cious infighting — to put M3 down 
on the familiar site in Mare 
Nectaris, where some use could 
be made of equipment already 
there. But the physical scientists, 
particularly the insatiable geo- 
logist/cosmologists (a new breed 
spawned by the program) had de- 
manded a spectacular new site and 
they had prevailed. M3 was to land 
near the rim of Tycho — where a 
substantial meteorite had recently 
impacted, forming a crater the size 
of a football field. The geologists 
could not contain their need to poke 
around in this place. Indeed, three 
of them were on the mission. 

N OW Red and Blue are on 
lunar trajectory. This path 
has not yet become a bus route, but 
it is different from before. There is 



a lot of light chatter baclc and forth 
between Houston and Red and Blue 
and not much sense of tension. At 
this point the mission has some- 
thing of the air of a fraternal 
picnic — which, in a sense, it is. 
These people all know each other, 
have worked and played together, 
and they are going on an outing. 

The sociology, if that’s the right 
word, is a mix. The first crew, now 
flying moonward, consists of one 
married couple, two married males 
(one of whom is Chris) whose wives 
are on Earth, one married female 
whose husband is also on Earth, 
two unattached men and one single 
woman. Of this crew two are 
Russian, two American, one 
English, one Chinese, one Japanese 
and one Italian. Three are women 
and five are men. Three are geo- 
logists. One is a doctor of medicine. 
One is an astronomer. One is a psy- 
chologist, one a virologist, one a 
geophysicist. 

“Blue from Houston.” 

“Roger.” This is Don Blake. 
He’s in charge of the Blue com- 
mand module. 

“You’re right on target, Don. No 
mid-course correction whatever. 
We just got it from the brain.” 

“Roger. This bird is flying itself. 
We’ve a bridge game going here.” 

“Tell Houston,” said Jean 
Miyasaka, “that these magnetic 
cards are no damn good. After this 
rubber we try poker. Though the 
cards will be the same the play will 
go better.” Jean, an American girl.

is half of the married couple 
in Blue. She and her husband, 
Tetsuo, are geologists. Geolo- 
gists/cosmologists; it all goes 
together. 

Blake relayed the message. 
“That’s just because she was put 
down, doubled and redoubled,” he 
added. Jean and Tetsuo were 
partners, playing against Chris and 
Doris. Doris Bennett. Doris is the 
psychologist. She is English, she is 
black — and she is beautiful. 

Blue broke contact with 
Houston. Blake kibitzed the game 
for a few minutes. Chris was 
dummy. Blake addressed him; 
“This is like a commuter train out 
of Grand Central. In the days they 
had trains. Greenwich, anyone? A 
milk run or something — huh, 
Chris?” 

“Nice and quiet, Don. Nice and 
quite.” 

“No excitement down there this 
time. Not like Mayflower One?” 
They were far enough along that 
Earth was now up, the moon down. 

“I devoutly hope so,” Chris said. 
“No emergency surgery this time.” 
He looked at the two girls. 
“Neither of you bribed someone in 
the lab, did you?” 

“Cross my heart,” Jean said. 

“Mine, too,” said Doris. 

“Best you’re leveling,” Chris 
said. 

They were.

MAYFLOWER THREE 



51 




Tycho was without untoward inci- 
dent. Moon landed first, followed 
shortly by Pepper. Chris flew Moon 
down and Leonid Dimov brought 
down Pepper. Dimov was the third 
geologist. The rest of the Pepper 
crew were: Anaida Golovin, astro- 
nomer; Shau Wang, virologist and 
Anacleto Gentili, geophysicist. 

There were two domes this time, 
connected by a narrow arched 
passageway, and that was another 
lunar first. The Blue crew would be 
in one, the Red in the other. The 
domes were again of Mylarplex and 
the crews had opted for the 
transparent variety. Translucent 
and opaque partitioning had also 
been supplied to the two moon 
crews — in that department they 
were free to work things out the 
way they wanted to. They didn’t 
have to use any of it, of course, 
though the Miyasakas had let it be 
known that they wished a measure 
of privacy. Chris, remembering 
the Mayflower 1, regretted this 
somewhat. But that had been 
then — and this was now. 

With a spurious sense of deja vu 
Chris, now in command decided 
where the domes should go. The 
two modules had landed where they 
had been meant to, about fifty 
yards from each other. The me- 
teorite crater was clearly visible 
about three hundred yards off and 
the geologists, all three of them, 
were for going over at once — as was 
Gentili, the geophysicist, whose dis- 
cipline was magnetometry. But 



Chris directed the setting-up opera- 
tions according to the big book. 

This mission did not have the 
pleasant lack of structure that had 
characterized Mayflower 1. Also, 
there were twice as many people. 
As things began to shape up within 
the domes Chris was surprised at 
the strength of his need for Teiko, 
his need for her presence, and he 
wondered again what he was doing 
up there without her. He was in and 
out of both domes, telling the 
colonists what to put where. This, 
he thought, begins to look like 
home again. He stood there, 
looking around. 

“Not like last time, eh, boss?” 

Chris turned. “No, not like last 
time, Doris.” 

“You don’t have Teiko this 
time.” 

“I didn’t have her last time 
either,” Chris said. “Only after we 
got back down.” 

“Yes. I know.” Doris and Teiko 
were good friends; they knew and 
appreciated each other. Teiko 
wasn’t jealous — she didn’t think 
— of Chris’s being up there in 
the Blue dome with Doris. “You’ll 
be a father when you get back 
down.” 

Now Chris felt guilty about 
this — he had not before. “You read 
everything those three girls wrote, 1 
suppose?” 

“1 did.” Doris’s glossy hair was 
short. She had wanted to wear the 
first Afro to the moon, but there 
was no room in the bowl for one. 



52 



GALAXY 




“Interesting reading, too. I know 
how it was up here. Or down here.” 
The Miyasakas came in and 
began to unsuit. 

“And Julia was right,” Doris 
said. “It is cozy, you know?” 

T he Blue dome contains a mar- 
ried couple in addition to Doris 
and Chris. The Red dome contains 
one woman and three men. One of 
the men is married and two are 
unattached. The woman, Anaida 
Golovin, has a husband on Earth. A 
narrow passageway connects these 
two places of comfort and security 
upon that harsh surface. The “day” 
is about over and they approach 
their first “night.” None, save 
Chris, has slept on the moon be- 
fore. 

But first, dinner. Chris, now a 
traditionalist, decreed that wine be 
served. And it was, in the Blue 
dome. The place of dining would be 
rotated from one dome to the other, 
as would the responsibility for pre- 
paring the food. There was a 
closeness, a drawing together. And 
then it was time to make for the 
sleeping bags. 

The Miyasakas partitioned off a 
small portion of the dome and 
placed their sleeping bags within. 

“I hope you don’t think we’re 
being rude,” said Tetsuo. They all 
knew how it had been on May- 
flower 1. 

“Not at all.” Chris hung a sheet 
of opaque Mylarplex on the op- 
posite side of the dome, creating a 



shadowed area. He placed his bag 
so his head would be in the shade. 
He looked at Doris. “You?” 

She placed her bag in a friendly 
(but not intimate) relation to 
Chris’s. “I want to make one thing 
perfectly clear,” she said. “I am 
truly devoted to Teiko. This place 
has an — ambiance. So — I want you 
to know that, Chris.” 

“I know. I am also devoted to 
Teiko. So it’s all right.” 

It had been a long day and they 
all were soon asleep. Even the geo- 
logists. 

II 

T he next morning the three 
geologists and the geophysicist 
were off to the impact crater like 
kids to a candy shop, like junkies to 
their fixes, like lovers to a ren- 
dezvous. The resident psychologist 
made a note of this. Shau Wang, 
muttering unintelligibly into his 
mike, set up strange devices here 
and there outside the dome — no 
one really knew what he was up to, 
other than that it had to do with, 
among other things, the effect of 
the solar wind upon viruses. Anaida 
set up both visual and UV tele- 
scopes. Most of her work would be 
done during the lunar night, but set- 
ting up and testing would give her 
plenty to do until then. This left 
Doris and Chris in the Blue dome 
with no immediate responsibilities. 
They tried to play chess, but the 
squawk box was too much for 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



53 




them. Each dome contained a so- 
phisticated communications lashup. 
Anyone inside either dome 
could, if he chose, be in continuous 
contact both with Mission Control 
and with the scientists out there on 
the surface. Now the Miyasakas, 
Dimov and Gentili were going 
crazy at the impact crater and Con- 
trol was irritated. 

“Don’t forget, you’re supposed to 
photograph everything before 
picking it up. Acknowledge?” 

“Da," said Dimov. They had, in 
fact, taken quite a few photographs, 
but they were also picking up rocks 
before taking pictures, as Chris had 
seen from the dome. He frowned 
and Doris made notes. He switched 
to a circuit that kept the mission 
together, but excluded Houston. 

“Listen, you guys,” he said. “I’m 
on the E circuit. I wouldn’t want to 
embarrass you in front of Control. 
I’ve seen at least two of you pick up 
rocks before anybody photo- 
graphed them. That’s a violation of 
the plan and you know it. Get with 
it. And if you want to talk back to 
the commander of this mission, cut 
Houston off first.” 

“Is too much to do,” Dimov said, 
having flicked the appropriate 
switch. “We have only fourteen 
days of light. We could spend 
months here, not just two weeks.” 

“The photographs are im- 
portant.” 

“All right,” Jean said. “I’ll 
photograph and let the boys do the 
picking — all right?” 



“Not fair, but that’s up to you.” 

“Is fair enough,” said Tetsuo. 
“Anyway, we’re not just collecting 
samples — we’re studying types and 
distribution. Tomorrow we begin to 
map.” 

They cut Houston back in. Chris 
thought they would go back to the 
planned, disciplined program the 
next day and so told Houston. They 
were scientists, after all. Though, at 
the moment, very human ones. 
Chris remembered the unau- 
thorized philatelic material carried 
to the moon by an Apollo team. 
Oh, well. No one before had 
prowled around in fresh detritus 
thrust up from lunar levels deeper 
than anyone knew anything 
whatever about. Kids today, 
serious scientists tomorrow. All 
right? 

They pushed their life-support 
systems to their limits, of course. 
And they did so every day until the 
beginning of the lunar night. 

T he lunar night, the second one 
for Chris. Anaida’s work would 
really begin now and she was eager 
for that. Wang brought his devices 
inside and established a small lab in 
the center of the Red dome. Gentili 
lovingly caressed a hundred 
magnetographs — he had work to do 
and was content. But the three geo- 
logists could only wait for the lunar 
dawn. They could pore over their 
samples, but they couldn’t slice 
them, couldn’t analyze them. 



54 



GALAXY 




“We have only six more days of 
work out there,” Dimoy said to the 
Miyasakas. These three now hud- 
dled disconsolately together. 

“We need more than that.” 
Tetsuo. 

“I’ll bet Goodman, Kazlovski, 
and Carpenter can’t wait to get up 
here,” Jean said. “Especially 
Goodman.” 

“Not to talk about it.” 

Tetsuo’s handsome profile was 
troubled. He looked at Jean, at 
Dimov. They had worked well 
together. 

“What if we won’t go back?” he 
asked. 

Houston wasn’t listening. 

Jean, startled, stared at her hus- 
band. Dimov was impassive. “I 
have had the same thought, friend.” 
“We — couldn’t,” Jean said. 
Tetsuo looked at her thought- 
fully. “Why not? We pay when we 
get back at end of second month, 
hai, but in meantime we do the 
work. Most important expedition 
of century. We it. We three.” 
“But—” 

Dimov twisted his mustache. “If 
we stay down, then four go up. If 
only four go up they can send only 
four down. We pay later, all right.” 
“Of the four — if we do this — they 
could send down Goodman, 
Kazlovski and Carpenter.” 

“Six geologists on eight-man 
team? No. Other work is im- 
portant. Though not as important 
as ours, of course.” 

“What do you think, Jean?” 



The same possessive lust was now 
in her eyes. “They’ll skin us alive 
when we get back.” 

Dimov shrugged. “But in the 
meantime — ” 

“The meantime, yes.” They were 
silent some moments. “Chris is 
Commander. He won’t let us to it.” 
“How can he stop us? How make 
us go?” Dimov asked. “If we are 
convinced that what we do is 
right?” 

The female of the species jumped 
ahead to tactics. “When do we tell 
Chris? When do we tell Houston? 
There are different possibilities.” 
“Yes,” said Dimov. “Time to go 
to bed. We think about it.” 

None of them slept well. 

T he lunar night passed with 
unseemly haste. For the most 
part the colonists — except for 
Anaida — were confined to the 
domes, because Anaida’s energy re- 
quirements, fighting against the 
cold night, were extravagant. Doris 
administered a discomfiting array 
of tests and spent hours analyzing 
the results — she had plenty to do. 
Chris did routine physicals, thought 
about Teiko and played chess with 
anyone who would play. Wang 
worked cozily in his lab. Gentili 
studied magnetographs, frequently 
shouting in Joy or hoarse despair as 
he found evidence for or against 
one of his many theories. He stead- 
fastly refused to confer with his en- 
vious colleagues on Earth. And the 
geologists developed their plot. 



MAYFLOWER THREE

T he day followed the night and 
the colonists (except for 
Anaida, who now stayed in the Red 
dome reading Russian novels — her 
data had been telemetered and she 
had little to do) regained occupancy 
of the lunar surface. The geologists 
mapped an ever-increasing area, 
but it was obvious that they 
couldn’t finish that job in the few 
days available, let alone collect the 
specimens they wanted. Frus- 
tration! And, alas, mutiny. 

They chose their time as best they 
could — the evening of the second 
(Earth) day after their first lunar 
night. 

“Chris,” Dimov said, after din- 
ner (simulated sirloin and almost- 
successful French fries). “And all of 
you might as well listen. I — I and 
the Miyasakas — are going to make 
a communication to Control that 
you should know about.” 

“I know,” Chris said. 

Three startled geologists. 

“You — know?” asked Tetsuo 
tightly. 

Chris nodded. 

“Know what?” asked Anaida. 
“You want to tell?” Chris asked 
Dimov. 

“All right. But first — how you 
know?” 

Chris nodded to Doris. “None of 
you will like this,” she said, “but 
both domes have been bugged as 
part of the, ah, psychological aspect 
of the mission.” 

Consternation, then, and quite a 
hassle about the evil of invasion of 



privacy, the immorality of eaves- 
dropping and such. 

“Control’s plan, not mine,” 
Doris said. “I follow orders like 
everybody else. At least 1 hope 
everybody else does.” 

“Will someone please say now 
what this is all about?” Wang asked 
with great courtesy. 

“You want to tell them?” Chris 
said again to Dimov. 

“Yes. I tell. You have not in- 
formed Control of our — plan?” 
“No.” 

“They not listening now?” Dimov 
cast a suspicious glance at the 
electronics bay. 

“No. Doris and I thought it bet- 
ter this way. If you hadn’t brought 
it up tonight, though, I would have. 
Houston needs to know.” 

“Know what, for Goddamn’s 
sake?” asked Gentili. 

“We don’t finish our work here in 
the time we have,” Dimov said. 
“So — we stay this time and go back 
with second crew.” 

“You cannot do that,” Wang 
said. 

“Who can make us go?” 
Everybody looked at Chris. “I 
know you’ve thought about this a 
lot,” he said. “I do, of course, order 
you to follow the mission plan.” 

“Of course. Your responsibility,” 
Jean said. “But how can you 
enforce that order? We’re outnum- 
bered, but physical force won’t 
work, will it?” 

“Obviously not. How about 
moral force, then?” 



56 



GALAXY 




“I tell you,” said Tetsuo. “Is bet- 
ter for the mission — for knowledge, 
for science — if we stay. We know 
this place. We know exactly what 
we have done and what is to do. Is 
more efficient, hai? The others 
would take days to catch up. Is bet- 
ter — any way you look — if we 
stay.” 

“You want to call Houston and 
tell that to Goodman, Kazlovski, 
and Carpenter?” 

“We know they won’t like it,” 
Jean said. “But they might even 
agree to it — in the best interests of 
the mission — of science.” 

“If you can sell them that you 
can sell surplus MERVs to the 
Friends’ Service Committee. You 
do see this puts me on the spot?” 

“Yes,” said Dimov. “I know that 
idiom. We sorry. But must do what 
is right.” 

“What you think is right. It’s 
mutiny, you know.” 

“Not mutiny. Uh — insubordi- 
nation, yes.” 

“You quibble. We’d better get 
Houston on the horn. You ready to 
put your case?” They nodded. 
“Okay.” Chris moved to the 
electronics bay and flicked the 
switch. “Houston from Tycho 
Base. Copy?” 

“Five by five, Chris.” 

“Roger. Bob — we seem to have a 
problem here.” Not the first time 
those words had been spoken. 

“Go.” 

“Roger, Bob. Just one.” He 
turned to the geologists. “Who 



wants it?” Dimov stepped forward 
and took the mike. 

“Is Dimov here. We — the 
Miyasakas and I — we have sug- 
gestion for improvement of mission 
plan.” 

“Go ahead, Leo.” 

“Yes. Is like this. We — the 
Miyasakas and I — the geologists, 
we think we should stay here for the 
second month to continue our 
work.” 

Bob Cunningham’s cool voice 
from Houston. “You’ve got to be 
kidding, Leo. You know you can’t 
do that.” 

“That’s what everybody says. But 
who is to stop us?” 

“This isn’t for me, Leo. I’m only 
capcom, you know. I’ll call you 
back as soon as I can. And it won’t 
belong. Houston out.” 

“Da. Tycho Base out.” 

I N TWELVE minutes the 
squawk box spoke. “Tycho 
Base from Houston.” 

Dimov took it. “Roger.” 

“Leo?” This was Manly Ryan, 
Program Director for Lunar 
Science. He was The Boss. He was 
a first-class scientist and a brilliant 
administrator. Dimov made his 
pitch and got the same answer, but 
this time with authority behind it. It 
was a harsh debate. 

“I admit,” Ryan said at one 
point, “that your argument is not 
entirely without merit. But you 
have Doctors Goodman, Car- 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



57 




penter and Kazlovski to think 
about, don’t you? Their approach 
isn’t precisely yours. They’re 
entitled to their shot at it, are they 
not?” 

Three adamant geologists on the 
lunar surface. 

“Ask them at least,” said Jean. 

“Good evening. Dr. Miyasaka. If 
I did and if they agreed to your 
plan — I’d overrule them and send 
them up anyway.” 

“They could refuse to come.” 

“Really, Dr. Miyasaka. Really. 
Ask them yourself. We’ve just 
patched into a conference call.” 

Dimov put the query. 

“Really, Leo, with all due re- 
spect, you appear to be out of your 
mind.” Goodman. 

“We come up, of course. Dr. 
Dimov. But of course.” Kazlovski. 

“You can’t be serious about this, 
Leo. We have our right to our work 
up there, too, and you know it.” 
Carpenter. 

“We’ll be in lunar orbit at the ap- 
pointed hour,” Goodman said, 
“and you had better believe it.” 

“Makes no difference,” Dimov 
said. “If we don’t go up you can’t 
come down.” 

“Yes we can. Who, as you say, is 
to stop us?” 

“But — then we couldn’t all get 
back up,” said Dimov. “The 
modules are good for only two 
round trips.” 

“Precisely. That would make a 
small problem, wouldn’t it? More 
geologists on the moon than could 



begotten off. Interesting, isn’t it?” 

Ryan broke in. “All right, ladies 
and gentlemen, knock it off.” 
Alicia Carpenter was the other 
lady. “Dr. Conway, do you have 
any suggestions? You’re in charge 
there.” 

“I don’t think they can be per- 
suaded, Dr. Ryan. If they 
can’t — there’s not much I can do.” 

Ryan agreed. He threatened, 
pleaded with and cajoled the geo- 
logists. They remained adamant. 

“We’ll try something else,” Ryan 
finally said. “This will take some 
time. You’ll be hearing from us. 
Houston out.” 

“Will do no good,” Dimov said. 
“Make no difference. Tycho Base 
out.” 

Again it was time for bed, but no 
one felt much like it. “I suppose we 
all realize that Blue and Red will be 
lifting off in short order. You know 
the schedule.” 

”Hai,” said Tetsuo. “But those 
geologists won’t be on board. Want 
to bet?” 

“No bet,” Chris said. “I suppose 
you know what you’re doing to the 
boys in the back room and to 
everyone who had anything to do 
with formulating the program and 
picking the personnel — particularly 
you three — to implement it?” 

“Look,” said Jean. “We know 
our heads will roll when we get 
back down there. We know that. It 
makes no difference. You’re not a 
scientist — you don’t know.” 

“Medicine isn’t a science, then?” 



58 



GALAXY 




“You know what I mean.” 

“I think I go to bed now,” Shau 
Wang said. “I would say one thing. 

I would like to stay here another 
month also. I could stay for a year 
and not do everything I want. But I 
go down anyway. So should you.” 

“There’s no virologist coming 
up,” Dimov said. 

“No. My place will be taken by 
seismologist. So what is dif- 
ference?” The geologists were 
silent. “So,” Wang continued, “you 
simply want it all for yourselves. 
All what? Fame? Some kind of 
fame you get for this. Acclaim? 
You be acclaimed all right, but for 
wrong reasons. Honor? You dis- 
honor our mission and those who 
selected you. Is all a can of 
worms.” 

“We know that none of you 
understand,” Tetsuo said. “We 
know. No need to try to say more. 
We do what we have to. Bugs still 
on?” 

“No,” Doris said. “Now I’ve 
told you about them they’ve lost 
their point. My work is almost done 
anyway. No bugs.” 

T etsuo and Jean went be- 
hind their partitions and the 
others to their accustomed places. 
Chris moved his bag close to 
Doris’s. They were conspirators. 
Chris had known about the bugs all 
along. 

“Not true, Doris, that your work 
is almost done, is it?” 

“Not exactly. I’m devious.” 



“You’re a psychologist. Bugs still 
on, right?” 

“I said I was devious.” She 
inserted a plug into her handsome 
left ear, the one away from Chris. 

“What do you think Ryan will 
come up with?” 

“Pressure.” 

“Applied how?” 

“We’ll probably know before 
morning.” 

There was no provision on May- 
flower 3 for any private circuit 
between the CO and Houston. No 
need for such had been anticipated. 
That oversight would be remedied 
on future missions. 

Sleep, now, in the Blue and Red 
domes. Earth hanging up there and 
Tycho stretching off into invisibility 
in the night. The squawk box 
coming to life again just after two 
o’clock, Tycho Base local time. 
They would ordinarily leave the 
boxes off at night, but tonight they 
were, of course, on. Chris hit the 
mike as fast as he could. 

“Tycho Base.” 

“Chris — old buddy — we have 
some news for you.” 

“Go.” 

“Sorry to wake you up, but we 
thought you’d like to know you now 
have two girls. Congratulations.” 

Chris had almost forgotten that 
Teiko was just about due. He knew 
guilt. “Thanks, man. She had 
twins, then?” 

“No. By two I meant Teiko and 
the new one. They’re both, as they 
say, doing fine.” 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



59

“Can I talk to her?” 

“She’s sleepy, but she had it easy. 
We’ve got her on hold. Just 
one — Teiko?” 

“Hai. Chris?” 

Chris cut both squawk boxes and 
put on the phones. Privacy in a 
lunar colony is a sometime thing. 
Sometimes wanted and needed, 
sometimes not. Chris and Teiko 
had the fringes of it now for a few 
moments. 

“I hold you,” Chris said at the 
end. “Both of you.” 

“Hai. Is good. She look like you, 
if you could be Japanese. Good 
night, Chris.” 

Teiko knew nothing of the 
problem of Mayflower 3, having 
been busy and out of range of a 
squawk box for the last few hours. 

There were congratulations, ordi- 
nary courtesy easing the tension 
for a few moments, and then the 
Blue and Red domes settled down 
for sleep again, Chris returning to 
his bag next to Doris. 

“Good show, boss. Such good 
news. I’m happy for you. All three 
of you.” 

“Thanks, Doris.” They edged 
with difficulty toward sleep. “I 
wanted it to be a girl.” 

“I know.” Of course, Chris 
thought. She's done every test on 
me there is. “You need sleep now, 
boss.” She had removed the plug 
from her ear. “We’ve a hard time 
coming up.” She reached out, took 
his hand and held it until he was 
asleep. 



AND they were all more or less 
. l \. asleep for something like two 
hours when the boxes came on 
again. Four thirty a.m. Ryan. 
“Tycho Base from Houston.” 
Chris, disturbed from pleasant 
dreams, took the mike. 

“Dr. Conway. I know the hour is 
inconvenient, but no more for you 
than for us. You all awake and lis- 
tening?” 

Chris looked around. Everyone 
was there. Disheveled mostly — but 
Wang looked as if he’d just come 
from the barber. 

“Our motley crew is assembled. 
Dr. Ryan,” Chris said. 

“Roger. Okay, Dr. Conway. And 
congratulations on the birth of your 
daughter. Now, we’re patched into 
another conference call. We’re not 
about to play Hail To The Chiefs 
but President McKinney will now 
speak to you. Mr. President — ” 
“Thank you. Doctor.” That fa- 
miliar voice. It was, Chris said 
later, as if there had been until then 
something stagy, arranged, about 
the Mayflower 3 contretemps. That 
voice squawked from the box into 
the dome and suddenly made it for 
real. His second shot on the air at a 
recalcitrant man on the moon and 
not much of a batting average going 
for him. In this case not man, but 
woman. “Dr. Miyasaka.” 

Jean knew this was for her — she 
was a U.S. citizen. Tetsuo was a 
Japanese national. 



60 



GALAXY 




“Yes, Mr. President.” 

“I have been told about your — er, 
suggestions to improve the scien- 
tific program of Mayflower Three. 
To come directly to the point, 
Doctor, you are specifically and 
expressly ordered to return to Earth 
as scheduled. You are, as you 
know, a member of NASA, a 
member organization of 1 ASA, and 
under certain acts of Congress you 
are under my direct command. I 
regret that it has become necessary 
to exercise that power of command. 
Do you acknowledge?” 

Jean swallowed air. “I — we — 
hear you, Mr. President. And 
we hear you with respect,” she 
said, shrugging. “But our minds are 
made up. We think it better — ” 

“Dr. Miyasaka.” The President’s 
voice was incisive. “It is not better. 
1 have not made this decision 
alone — I am not a scientist. Your 
suggestion has been considered — 
almost from the moment you 
proposed it — by the top echelons 
of the appropriate scientists in 
lASA. You should know that the 
decision to stay with the original 
program is unanimous.” 

“Your decision, Mr. President. 
Ours is unanimous also.” 

“Three selfish and headstrong 
geologists against the consensus of 
the top scientists in your field?” 
“We’re here — they’re not.” Jean 
was flushed and her voice trembled. 

/, little Jean from Santa Barbara, 
arguing with the President of the 
United States! 



“You have your orders. Dr. 
Miyasaka. Dr. Tetsuo Miyasaka?” 
Tetsuo took the mike. “Yes, Mr. 
President.” 

“Your Emperor, Doctor.” 

There followed a staccato ex- 
change in Japanese, during which 
Tetsuo paled and began to tremble. 
Jean touched his hand and that 
steadied him some. Chris gathered 
from Tetsuo’s tone that he was 
standing firm. This was correct. 

That exchange ended and a 
Russian voice came on. The Sec- 
retary General of the Party, of 
course. Same story. Then President 
McKinney again. 

“All right. Doctors,” he said. 
“All of you have your orders from 
the leaders of your three countries. 
Our powers of persuasion appear to 
be ineffective. Are we to under- 
stand, then, that you intend to carry 
out this act of mutiny, though it 
means either suicide or murder?” 
“We are not murderers,” Dimov 
said, “and we do not intend to com- 
mit suicide.” 

“This mission, gentlemen — and 
lady — will continued as planned. In 
a short time we are sending to 
Tycho Base seven scientists/ 
colonists, certainly including Doc- 
tors Kazlovski, Carpenter and 
Goodman. That will make eleven. 
Eight can return to lunar orbit, and 
thence to Earth. Thus, if you 
continue as you plan, you kill either 
yourselves or others. Murder or sui- 
cide. Good luck. Doctors Conway, 
Bennett, Wang, Gentili and Go- 



MAYFLOWER THREE

lovin. Good morning.” There was a 
click and that was that. 

“Better think it over, Doctors,” 
Ryan said. “They mean it. Houston 
out.” 

C HRIS studied the three geo- 
logists. “You’re causing a bit 
of trouble, aren’t you? And the real 
part of it hasn’t started yet.” 

“It’s a bluff,” Jean said. “They 
wouldn’t dare. It would be 
murder.” 

“Exactly,” said Wang. “Just as 
the President said. And who will be 
the murderers, then?” 

“Certainly not we.” 

“I think so,” said Wang. “I think 
so. It will be, in any case, an 
interesting experiment, yes?” 
“You’re being cold-blooded 
about this,” Tetsuo said. 

Wang smiled. “I?” 

Everyone was sleepy and in a bad 
mood and there was a sense of ten- 
sion. There hadn’t been much rest 
and there was work to do. Wang 
and Gentili, who had the duty, be- 
gan to prepare breakfast. Wang, 
acting as if he’d spent a decade as 
head waiter at Maxim’s, passed 
coffee and that helped. 

“What if the President isn’t bluf- 
fing, you guys?” Chris asked. 

“Is not possible,” said Dimov. 
“As a matter of idle curiosity,” 
Doris asked, “what would you do if 
you knew the other three were, in 
fact, coming up here?” 

“I guess we’ll find out in a couple 
of days when Red and Blue are on 



lunar trajectory,” Jean said. “If 
they aren’t aboard, we’ve won. If 
they are aboard and say they’re 
coming down — ” 

“Yes,” said Doris. “What if it’s 
like that?” 

“They land at their peril,” Dimov 
said. “Because we don’t go up.” 
“You mean,” Doris went on, 
“that if they do come, when it’s 
time to go back you’d just leave 
them here? Room on the bus for 
you but not for them? How would 
you make them accept that? How 
coiild you accept that?” 

“They come at own risk. If they 
come down while we here they 
know they can’t get up again. 
Simple.” 

“They know some three can’t get 
up — that’s right, Leo. But who will 
say which three? Women and chil- 
dren first? We’ve women, though 
no children. Geologists first, they 
being so important? We’ll have six 
of those.” This was Doris, laying it 
on them. “And how decide? Mortal 
combat? It would be mortal, all 
right.” 

There was a silence. 

“Is a can of worms,” Wang said. 
“Is not civilized. Is not worthy.” 

“I agree with you,” Gentili said. 
“And in the meantime I have my 
own work, which I propose to do.” 
He suited up and left the dome; 
back to the impact crater, where 
things were better ordered. Anaida 
began to clean up. Wang went to 
his devices and Doris and Chris sat 
there. 



62 



GALAXY 




“For people wanting to spend a 
lot of time at the crater, you’re 
losing a lot of it,” Chris said. “You 
want to talk it over among 
yourselves — with no bugs?” 

“What we care for hugs?” Tetsuo 
said. “Anyway we have now no 
secrets.” 

“You’re right. Commander,” 
Dimov said. “We waste time here. 
Let us go.” 

They suited up and left. 



<< does Wang make bet- 

ter coffee than anyone 
else?” Chris asked. “We all 
use the same stuff.” Chris was 
alone in the dome with Doris. 
Anaida read a Russian novel in the 
other dome. “Tea should be his 
bag — excuse the expression — not 
coffee.” 

“Class. Elegance. Style,” said 
Doris. “Any ideas, boss?” 

“One, anyway.” 

“Want me to split?” 

“Well, you’re the psycho- 
logist — maybe you should know,” 
he said and told her what he had in 
mind. “Might be useful in the end,” 
he said, “don’t you think?” 

“I had thought of something like 
that,” Doris said. 

“So what say? Go or no go?” 
“Might as well try, boss. I don’t 
envy you.” 

“Okay. Go into the other dome 
like the good girl you are — and be 
sure Anaida isn’t listening. 

Chris then cut off the link to the 



other colonists and spoke at some 
length to Houston. 

<<^YCHO BASE from Red. 
1 Copy, Chris?” 

“Loud and clear, Chas.” 

“We enter lunar orbit in forty- 
eight minutes. Moon takes off 
in — let’s see — six hours and thirty- 
one minutes. Pepper thirteen 
minutes later. Any problems?” 
“Yes.” 

“Roger. Just want to put it on the 
record. Is your crew assembled?” 
“Roger, Chas. We’re here, but 
not for long. As you know. We’ll be 
going over to the modules shortly. 
Some of us will, that is.” 

“Yes. Okay, you’re all there 
copying. Now a word from our 
sponsor. I mean, just time for a few 
special messages. Directed to your 
three geologists, from our three 
geologists. All right, Alicia.” 

“I am Alicia Carpenter. I am a 
geologist. I am also an astronette. I 
will soon be coming down to the 
lunar surface. I am twenty-six years 
old, my hair is blond — ” 

“For Christ’s sake, Alicia. The 
whole world is listening, (It wasn’t.) 
All right. I suppose you all heard 
that down there. Control wants us 
to get it all on the record. Okay, 
Vlad.” 

“Roh-ghay,” came the voice. “Is 
Vladimir Kazlovski, geologist. I 
address the Doctors Miyasaka and 
Doctor Dimov. I, too, will soon be 
on the lunar surface to study rocks. 
My hair is brown — ” 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



63 




Chas sighed. “All right! 
Goodman?” 

“Ah, yes. Maximilian Goodman 
here. Geologist. My hair, as it hap- 
pens, is black. It’s okay, Chas, 
don’t fret. I’ll get on with it. We 
three, we happy band of fellow 
geologists, not to mention cos- 
mologists, are putting on this 
show to remind Jean, Tetsuo and 
Leo that we are indeed here and 
that we shall be descending shortly. 
So get the modules up. Doctors, 
and don’t be forgetful and remain 
behind. That would, as you under- 
stand, make a problem.” 

“All right, Chris. Time for you to 
begin your countdowns for Moon 
and Pepper. We’ll be seeing you 
soon. Not you, Chris, but everyone 
else, I hope.” 

“Roger. Don’t hold your breath. 
Tycho Base out.” 

I AST-MINUTE preparations 

' were essentially complete. 
Suiting up was in progress. Chris 
looked at the three geologists. 

“Your hour of decision is at 
hand,” he said. 

“Is wrong,” Dimov said. “Our 
hour of decision was some days 
ago.” 

“Carpenter, Kazlovski and 
Goodman are coming down, you 
know.” 

“Bluff.” 

“I order you to suit up and 
prepare for liftoff.” 

“No go.” 



“Well. If the President, the Em- 
peror and the Secretary can’t move 
you I don’t suppose I can. Okay. 
Doris — you, Gentili, Anaida, 

Shau — all set?” They nodded. 
“Good thing we all know how to 
fly, right?” 

Gentili and Doris would go up in 
Moon, Anaida and Wang in Pep- 
per, the modules they had landed 
in. 

The President, always a most 
persistent man, came on once more. 
To no avail. 

Chris took Doris aside. “I wish 
you were staying. I do. Give my 
love to Teiko and the baby.” 

“Of course. I want to stay, too. 
But — you know — ” 

Moon and Pepper lifted off fault- 
lessly. 

A nd landed with seven scientists. 

1. Eventually all were together 
in the Blue dome. 

“At least we’ll lose weight,” 
Goodman, who was plump, said. 
“Assuming we divide the rations 
equally.” 

“What other way is there to do 
it?” Dimov. 

“Well, the eight of us who are 
supposed to be here could have 
what we’re supposed to and you 
could have what was left.” 

“Would be nothing left.” 

“That’s right.” 

Dimov and the Miyasakas looked 
at each other. 

“Our energy supply is also for 
eight,” Chris said. “We are eleven. 



64 



GALAXY 




Therefore everything is cut down by 
more than a quarter. You had 
thought of that, of course.” 

“Did not think these three would 
be so foolish as to come,” said 
Dimov. 

“If you’re trying to make us feel 
guilty,” Jean said, “you’re not suc- 
ceeding.” 

“Why the troubled look on your 
face then?” Chris asked. 

“We do realize that we’ve created 
a problem. But we’ve only done 
what we have to do. None of you 
can understand that.” 

“It’s possible we might under- 
stand that,” Maximilian Goodman 
said. “We are geologists also. But 
I -we — will tell you one thing. The 
three of us intend to go back to 
Earth.” 

Chris knew where this would all 
lead in the end. Or almost all the 
way to the end. He was the com- 
mander and he had a secret 
weapon. He felt now totally alone 
and wished for Mayflower 1. 

“We are supposed to be eight and 
we are eleven. The housing will be 
as follows: the six geologists in the 
Red dome, the rest of us here.” 

The rest were: Chris, com- 

manding officer of an imperiled 
colony; Gladys Copperwaite, a psy- 
chiatrist from Cambridge (Eng- 
land); Donald Markel, an astro- 
nomer from Cambridge (Massa- 
chusetts); Ursula Louval, a 
psychoanalyst from Paris; and 
Aristotle Bozos, an unknown 
quantity from no one (barring 



Chris) knew where. No seis- 
mologist, as originally planned. No 
geophysicist. Instead, one addi- 
tional head person plus Aristotle 
Bozos. 

The ambiance in the domes was 
not as it had been and eleven to dine 
in one dome were too many. Chris 
decreed that the geologists would 
take their meals in the Red dome, 
the others in the Blue. 

“Do you think it’s wise to have 
them all together?” Gladys asked. 
“Why not?” 

“Well — that dome will be a little 
tense. Hostility, guilt, fear — ” 
“We’ll leave it that way — at least 
until the lunar night begins. Things 
may get hairy then. We’ll see.” 
“There’s no way we can all make 
it, is there?” 

“No way, Gladys. lASA can 
mount no rescue mission. The 
hardware isn’t there.” 

“I suppose those three knew 
that.” 

“They knew it.” 

“What is Aristotle Bozos’ 
function?” 

“That’s classified.” 

“Oh. Sorry, boss.” 

“Okay. I know your function, by 
the way. Good luck.” 

Gladys shrugged, ending the 
exchange. 

The next days passed almost 
smoothly. The two teams of geo- 
logists worked separately during 
the day, but compared notes at 
night without rancor, almost as if 
they didn’t know, with virtual

certainty, that all six would not 
return to Earth. Scientific interest, 
the thirst for knowledge, evidently 
could overcome animosity as well 
as fear of lonesome lunar death. 

Aristotle Bozos mostly read and 
watched people. He was large, 
hairy, dark and amiable. He went 
out on the lunar surface from time 
to time to no apparent purpose. 
While the light lasted Mayflower 3 
proceeded on an almost normal 
course. The colonists were hungry a 
good part of the time, but there 
were no serious complaints about 
that. 

And the night came.

D onald markel collated 

data and constructed charts 
that none of the others could under- 
stand. The six geologists studied 
their maps and theorized as tension 
built up in the Red dome. Maxi- 
milian Goodman looked through 
his notebooks and thought a 
lot — he was pleased because he was 
losing weight. Gladys Copperwaite 
and Ursula Douval arranged a cu- 
bicle in the B/we dome and they 
both — separately and together — in- 
terviewed everybody, particularly 
the geologists, in such privacy as 
was available. Their mission? To 
assist — if not to coerce — the 
Miyasakas and Dimov in the deter- 
mination of a rational course of 
action when came time for liftoff. 



since all of them could not make it. 

“Making any headway?” Chris 
asked them one night in the quiet of 
the Blue dome. 

“None worth mentioning,” Ur- 
sula said, “but at least 1, we, keep 
confronting them with the prob- 
lem. Goodman, Carpenter and 
Kazlovski are, of course, de- 
termined to survive the mission. As 
is right. Okay. But the other three 
simply won’t talk about being left 
behind when the rest of us leave. 
They think autistically. They speak 
of a rescue mission.” 

“That’s out of the question.” 
“Yes. And they know that 
somehow, somewhere. But they’re 
not facing it. Not one of them.” 
“Tetsuo?” 

“He’s no better than the 
others — in spite of being Japanese. 
And he’s in this with his wife, of 
course, which is one more compli- 
cation. He’s not about to take the 
hara-kiri route.” 

Chris asked, “Has it occurred to 
them that we can take everyone 
back but one?” Ursula’s pupils di- 
lated and Gladys gasped. “I guess it 
hasn’t occurred to you either. How 
really curious it is.” 

“How?” asked Gladys. 

“Come on. Ursula?” 

“I don’t see it.” 

“How brainwashed we are. The 
mission is more or less shattered, 
certainly not going according to 
plan, but apparently nobody in 
these two domes thinks about vio- 
lating the plan still more in the 



66 



GALAXY 




interest of saving a life or two. Cu- 
rious, yes?” 

“Yes. Okay, we give up.” ’ 

The three were to one side, 
talking quietly. Markel and Bozos 
were playing chess, paying no at- 
tention. Bozos was holding his own, 
though Markel had once held 
master rating. 

“The rocks.” 

“What about them?” 

“Don’t you get it? The automatic 
assumption is that the rocks go up 
when we do because that’s part of 
the plan. Moon and Pepper are 
each to take up not less than one 
hundred and fifty pounds of 
selected samples, no more than a 
hundred and sixty pounds. The 
rocks will survive here, won’t they, 
until someone can come to pick 
them up? The people can’t. Jean 
weighs about one twenty-five. We 
can take her in one module, plus 
about thirty pounds of the more im- 
portant specimens. Tetsuo and 
Dimov are both about one sixty. 
So — no rocks in the other module, 
one scientist. Simple.” 

Ursula, the psychoanalyst, was 
thoughtful indeed. “You’re right. 
Commander. I cannot understand 
how we all missed that. We live on 
the edge of mystery. If not igno- 
rance. And I’m an analyst. Holy 
Toledo. Will Houston go along 
with it?” 

“They’ve ordered it.” 

“Was this your idea or theirs?” 
“Both. I said it first, but they had 
put it together by the time I did. It 



is a rather obvious partial solution 
to the problem.” 

“I feel like an absolute idiot,” 
Ursula said. “This changes things 
some, doesn’t it?” 

“It do, shrink, it do.” 

“One of the three has to stay. Die 
here, right?” 

“No other way.” 

“Why didn’t you tell Gladys and 
me earlier?” 

“Orders. Ask one of your 
colleagues on Earth. We are rats in 
mazes, you know.” 

“All right. The one that’s left — it 
will, I suppose, be one of the 
three?” 

“I don’t think one of the rest of 
us is going to play the sacrificial 
lamb. I know I’m not. I’ve got a 
daughter on Earth I haven’t yet 
seen. The others — except the 
three — deserve to survive. Either of 
you want to volunteer?” 

They shook their heads. 

“So. Our ploy now is to put this 
to them and leave it to them to de- 
termine who goes. Right?” 

“You’re the doctor.” 

“You’re the commander. Where 
is Bozos in this?” 

“Classified. I can tell you one 
thing about him, though — he plays 
an expert Najdorf.” 

“Thanks a lot. Okay, Com- 
mander. I know how to get them all 
down.” 

“So do I. Have Dimov and 
Tetsuo fast down to eighty pounds 
each. That what you were thinking 
of?” 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



67 




“Yes. But not seriously.” 

“No way. Not enough time.” 
“Anything else we can leave be- 
hind — to be picked up later with the 
rocks?” 

“Negative. Rocks and people, 
notebooks and data, are about all 
we have for payload.” 

“I would very much like a 
cigarette now,” Gladys said. 
“That’s the first thing I’ll ask for 
when we hit that carrier.” 

“Medics won’t let you, you know 
that. What’s on your mind?” 

“The chess-playing Bozos, for 
one. I don’t know what he’s here 
for, but he’s not doing much. Why 
didn’t lASA simply leave him 
down there? Then we could all get 
down. Seems either cold-blooded or 
badly thought out.” 

“Think about it. No — it’s time 
for sleep. I’ll tell you. And don’t 
assume lASA didn’t think about 
this — they did. All the way to the 
top. A simple matter of precedent.” 
Silence for some moments. “1 
think I get it,” Ursula said. 

“We won’t go to the planets, then 
to the stars — our great grandchil- 
dren won’t — without . discipline. 
We’ll die.” 

“So lASA is deliberately sacri- 
ficing one scientist, one life — one 
life they could have saved — to 
make the point?” 

“That’s right. And I am — I 
think — with lASA. Anyway, that’s 
the way it is.” 

They sat in silence, looking up at 
Earth, a blue-green moon up 



there — home. I've two girls up 
there. Chris thought. I’ll be there 
soon. 

“You’re right,” said Ursula fi- 
nally. “It is time for sleep. Busy day 
for me tomorrow. Good night. 
Commander.” 

Lights out in both domes. 

T he group session next 
morning (the lunar night con- 
tinuing) added tension, doubt and 
uncertainty, not to mention con- 
flict, to the mix already present in 
the first geological team. Markel 
didn’t know what was going on and 
didn’t much care — he had work to 
do and the chess with Bozos went 
well. Chris chose breakfast time, 
the day of the lunar dawn, to talk to 
everyone at the same time. He had 
asked the Red crew to bring in 
tables so they could breakfast 
together. The terminator had 
passed through — or over — Tycho 
during their night and the ambiance 
within the domes had changed 
again. Now there was bright light, 
the impact crater out there, all 
those rocks and work to be done. 

“Most of you know this al- 
ready,” Chris said, over coffee, 
“but perhaps we should all have a 
look at it together. We lift off in six 
days. I wish Wang were here. He 
made better coffee.” He cast an ac- 
cusing glance at Bozos and outlined 
the situation. 

He said at the end, “So one of 
us — one of you, because I’ll be 
going back home — one of us will re- 



68 



GALAXY 




main here. To join Nora Ivanovna 
and Stuart Stong. One of you three, 
1 should say,” he said, looking at 
the Miyasakas and Dimov. 

“Why one of us?” Jean asked. 
“I’m not saying we do or don’t ac- 
cept that. But why?” 

“Because I say so and because 
lASA says so. To be trite about it, 
you brought this upon yourselves. 
Well, there’s no discussion about it. 
One of you three stays here — and 
which one is your decision. And I 
have nothing else to say. Ques- 
tions?” 

“What if we can’t — uh — decide?” 
Dimov asked. Bozos threw him a 
speculative glance. 

“Then I decide. But best you do it 
yourselves, right? I know you’ve 
been talking about it.” 

“Hai. We decide what to do, all 
right. But now, if meeting over, is 
work to be done.” 

“The meeting is adjourned,” 
Chris said. 

The geologists, all six of them, 
lost no time getting back to the 
crater. 

WE draw straws?” 
-i— ^ Dimov asked, the three of 
them talking together that evening. 

“Maybe you and I,” Tetsuo said. 
“We can’t leave Jean here.” 

“That’s a male chauvinist sexist 
remark,” Jean said. “My status 
here is the same as yours. Precisely. 
Besides, Tetsuo and I are husband 
and wife. Can one of us leave the 
other here?” 



“You are suggesting I volunteer 
to stay? I have a wife, too. In 
Moscow.” Dimov looked up at 
Earth. 

“No, I’m not suggesting that. It’s 
going to be a tough decision any 
way it goes. Maybe we could leave 
Bozos. He doesn’t do anything ex- 
cept play chess with Markel. He’s 
not even a scientist, 1 don’t think.” 
“1 don’t think he look like kind of 
man to make sacrifice,” Dimov 
said. “Chris will say nothing about 
why he is here. If he is not here we 
all go back.” 

“Maybe you and I attack him in 
dome. Kill the bastard.” 

“Is something to think about.” 
“Then you’ll spend the rest of 
your lives in jail,” Jean said. 

“Better than dying alone on 
moon, yes?” 

“Could strangle him at night 
when all asleep. Solve problem.” 
“We’re in plenty of trouble in any 
case when we get back,” Jean said. 
“Murder wouldn’t be much worse 
than what they’ve already got on 
us. And we’d live. Be paroled in old 
age — who knows?” She felt light- 
headed. She couldn’t stand the idea 
of being left there by herself and she 
couldn’t think of leaving Tetsuo 
there. And she knew the chances 
were two in three that one of them 
would draw the short straw — if it 
came to that. 

“Doesn’t have to be Bozos,” 
Dimov said. “Could be any other?” 
The Miyasakas shook their 
heads. “No,” Tetsuo said. “Is 



MAYFLOWER THREE 



69 




wrong. Cannot do that. Must be 
this Bozos — or one of us.” 

They saw the correctness of this 
while trying not to see the incor- 
rectness, let alone the difficulty, of 
picking on Bozos. Denial, evasion, 
and more denial. 

“I guess Houston isn’t lying when 
they say they can’t mount a rescue 
mission,” Jean said. 

“They either can’t or won’t,” 
Tetsuo said. “Same thing.” He 
touched Jean’s hand and between 
the three of them was a crystalliza- 
tion of understanding and ap- 
praisal. One of them would stay 
here, to die alone on the gray sur- 
face — unless they saw to it that 
someone else was stranded. Which 
meant Bozos. And they opted for 
Bozos rather than one of them. 
Simple. 

Thus the line was drawn. 



T he five in the Blue dome 
spoke together. Markel was 
interested only from the spectator 
point of view — the others were 
more involved. “They’ll be after 
you,” Gladys said, looking at Aris- 
totle Bozos. “They can’t figure why 
you were sent up here, one conse- 
quence of your presence being that 
one of them can’t go back home.” 
Bozos smiled. “They’ve been 
after me,” he said. “For two days. 
But they are — if I can say so 
without offense — outclassed.” 
“Why did lASA send you here?” 
Ursula asked. 



“For the lesson, the demon- 
stration — you understand,” Bozos 
said. 

“But for that they could at least 
have sent a scientist, a worker, not 
a — chess player.” 

Bozos was unflappable. “Yes. Is 
maybe one other reason also. 
Perhaps we find out tomorrow. Is 
liftoff, yes? We see.” 

Liftoff, yes. Time now to go 
back. Thirty-odd pounds of rocks 
and dust are already stowed in 
Moon. The module stands there, 
waiting only for five colonists and 
their personal gear to complete the 
payload. Pepper nearby. It is 
the last night, though still the lunar 
day. The only certainty is that 
someone here is going to terminate 
shortly. 

There are two attempts on 
Bozos’ life during the night. Bozos 
is mightily muscled — he is alert and 
he deals with these attempts with 
contemptuous ease. Besides, the 
forays are clumsy and awaken 
others. 

Bozos’s probability of survival 
was unimpaired when, at suit-up 
time, he and Chris entered the Red 
dome. 

“Time to decide,” Chris said. 
“Which of you stays behind?” 

The other three geologists were 
already into their suits, anxious to 
be gone. Chris stood there, con- 
fident, in command, looking for- 
ward to seeing his two girls. It was 
too much and Tetsuo and Dimov 
were suddenly back in the cave. 



70 



GALAXY 




They leapt at the same instant upon 
( hris, who had not expected this. 
No matter. Bozos glided smoothly 
f orward, kneed Tetsuo into anguish 
and knocked Dimov halfway across 
the dome. He stood back smiling 
and drew a Colt .45 from a pocket 
of his jumper. 

“That was a no-no,” Chris said. 
“Bad judgment, besides. Mr. 
Bozos’ function — uh— now be- 

comes clear.” 

“The Enforcer.” 

The other two girls and Markel 
had come in from the Blue dome. 

“That’s right,” Chris said. “The 
mission had to survive — most of it, 
that is. It was in jeopardy because 
of the situation you created. I, and 
I ASA, foresaw violence. And I am 
not a — violent man. Hence, Aris- 
totle Bozos, a recruit from 
a — well — different organization. 

Thanks, Aristotle.” Bozos nodded. 
“And now you must make your de- 
cision.” 

“Cheap melodrama,” muttered 
Tetsuo. 

“But effective.” 

Tetuo shrugged. “We draw lots, 
Dimov and I.” Dimov nodded. 

“We all draw lots,” said Jean. 
“I’m in this as much as you.” 

Dimov scribbled on three scraps 
of paper, crumpled them in his ex- 
tended hand. Jean and Tetsuo each 
took one, uncrumpled them. 

“I’m it,” Jean said, blank-faced. 
“The rest of you had better hurry. 
We’re a little late.” 

There was embarrassment and 



confusion all round, people milling 
back and forth. Then Chris and the 
rest of the Blue crew went back to 
their dome, began to suit up. Jean 
came running in, floating through 
the lunar gravity. 

“Where’s Tetsuo?” 

They looked at her blankly. She 
went to the side of the dome then, 
near the air lock, and looked out- 
side. Frantically, she began to unzip 
the lock. Bozos gently restrained 
her. 

“He must have walked out just 
after we drew,” she said. 

Bozos nodded, but no one noticed 
it. Chris looked outside, saw the 
figure lying there. 

“He is dead, Jean. Suit up now. 
We must get going.” 

Jean’s face froze into a blank 
expression that would be there a 
long time. Gladys and Ursula pro- 
pelled her into the other dome and 
helped her into her suit. 

""Blue, Red and Houston from 
Tycho Base.” 

Three rogers at once. 

“We’re leaving the domes now. 
We’re four minutes behind 
schedule, but we’ll make it up.” 
“Roger. No sweat. Who — ” 
“Tetsuo Miyasaka is dead, about 
ten yards from the air lock. Jean 
got the black ball and Tetsuo took a 
walk. Tycho Base out.” 

And they left that place. Jean 
stopped, bent down, as they passed 
Tetsuo. She put her gloved hand on 
his cheek for a moment, then went 
on to the module. ★ 



MAYFLOWER THREE

■^^HEN Zozz, home from the 
Wpit, had licked his fur clean, he 
howled before John Bananas’ 
door. John’s wife, Teresa, opened it 
and let him in. She was a thin, 
stooped woman of thirty or thirty- 
five, her black hair shot with gray. 
She did not smile, but he felt 
somehow that she was glad to see 
him. 

She said, “He’s not home yet. If 
you want to come in we’ve got a 
fire.” 

Zozz said, “I’ll wait for him — ” 



and six-legging politely across the 
threshold sat down over the stone 
Bananas had rolled in for him when 
they had been new friends. Maria 
and Mark, playing some sort of 
game with bottle caps on squares 
scratched on the floor dirt said, 
“Hi, Mr. Zozz — ” and Zozz said, 
“Hi — ” in return. Bananas’ old 
mother, whom Zozz had brought 
here from the pads in his rusty 
powerwagon the day before, looked 
at him from piercing eyes then fled 
into the other room. He could hear

Teresa relax, hear her wheezing 
outpuffed breath. 

He said, “I think she thinks I 
bumped her on purpose yesterday.” 
“She’s not used to you yet.” 

“I know,” Zozz said. 

T told her. Mother Bananas, it’s 
their world and they’re not used to 
you." 

“Sure,” Zozz said. A gust of 
wind outside brought the cold in to 
replace the odor of the gog-hutch 
on the other side of the left wall. 

“1 tell you it’s hell to have your

There were no wise men from 
the east. But a woman had 
arrived from another planet . 



husband’s mother with you in a 
place as small as this.” 

“Sure,” Zozz said again. 

Maria announced, “Daddy’s 
home!” 

The door rattled open and 
Bananas came in, looking tired and 
cheerful. Bananas worked in the 
slaughtering market and though his 
cheeks were blue with cold, his 
two trousers cuffs were red with 
blood. He kissed Teresa and tou- 
sled the hair of both children and 
said, “Hi, Zozzy.” 



73 



Zozz said, “Hi. How does it 
roll?” And moved over so Bananas 
could warm his back. 

Someone groaned and Bananas 
asked a little anxiously, “What’s 
that?” 

Teresa said, “Next door.” 

“Huh?” 

“Next door. Some woman.” 

“Oh. I thought it might be 
Mom.” 

“She’s fine.” 

“Where is she?” 

“In back.” 

Bananas frowned. “There’s no 
fire in there. She’ll freeze to death.” 
“I didn’t tell her to go back there. 
She can wrap a blanket around 
herself.” 

Zozz said, “It’s me — I bother 
her.” He got up. 

Bananas said, “Sit down.” 

“I can go. I just came to say hi.” 
“Sit down.” Bananas turned to 
his wife. “Honey, you shouldn’t 
leave her in there alone. See if you 
can’t get her to come out here, 
okay?” 

“Johnny — ” 

“Teresa, dammit!” 

“Okay, Johnny.” 

B ananas took off his coat 
and sat down in front of the 
fire. Maria and Mark had gone 
back to their game. 

In a voice too low to attract their 
attention Bananas said, “Nice 
thing, huh?” 

Zozz said, “I think your mother 
makes her nervous.” 



Bananas said, “Sure.” 

Zozz said, “This isn’t an easy 
world.” 

“For us two-leggers? No, it ain’t, 
but you don’t see me moving.” 

Zozz said, “That’s good. I mean, 
here you’ve got a job anyway. 
There’s work.” 

“That’s right.” 

Unexpectedly Maria said, “We 
get enough to eat here, and me and 
Mark can find wood for the fire. 
Where we used to be there wasn’t 
anything to eat.” 

Bananas asked, “You remember, 
honey?” 

“A little.” 

Zozz said, “People are poor 
here.” 

Bananas was taking off his shoes, 
scraping the street mud from them 
and tossing it into the fire. He said, 
“If you mean us, us people are poor 
everyplace.” He jerked his head in 
the direction of the back room. 
“You ought to hear her tell about 
our world.” 

“Your mother?” 

Bananas nodded. “You should 
hear what she has to say.” 

Maria said, “Daddy, how did 
grandmother get here?” 

“Same way we did.” 

Mark said, “You mean she 
signed a thing?” 

“A labor contract? No, she’s too 
old. She bought a ticket — you 
know, like you would buy some- 
thing in a store.” 

Maria said, “Why did she come. 
Daddy?” 



74 



GALAXY 




“Shut up and play. Don’t bother 
us.” 

Zozz said, “How did things go at 
work?” 

“So-so.” Bananas looked toward 
Ihe back room again. “She came 
into some money, but that’s her 
business. I never ask her anything 
about it.” 

“Sure.” 

“She says she spent every dollar 
to get here — you know, they 
haven’t used dollars even on Earth 
for fifty, sixty years, but she still 
says it. How do you like that?” He 
laughed and Zozz laughed, too. “I 
asked how she was going to get 
back and she said she’s not going 
back. She’s going to die right here 
with us. What could I possibly 
answer?” 

“I don’t know.” Zozz waited for 
Bananas to say something and 
when he did not, added: “I mean. 



She is your mother, after all.” 
“Yeah.” 

Through the thin wall they heard 
the sick woman groan again and 
someone moving about. Zozz said, 
“I guess it’s been a long time since 
you saw her last.” 

“Yeah — twenty-two years New- 
tonian. Listen, Zozzy — .” 
“Uh-huh.” 

“You know something? 1 wish I 
had never set eyes on her again,” 
Bananas said. 

Zozz said nothing, rubbing his 
hands, hands, hands. 

“That sounds lousy I guess.” 

“I know what you mean.” 

“She could have lived good for 
the rest of her life on what that 
ticket cost her.” Bananas was silent 
for a moment. “She used to be a 
big, fat woman when 1 was a kid, 
you know? A great big woman with 
a loud voice. Look at her

now — dried up and bent over. It’s 
like she wasn’t my mother at all. 
You know the only thing that’s the 
same about her? That black dress. 
That’s the only thing I recognize, 
the only thing that hasn’t changed. 
She could be a stranger — she tells 
stories about me I don’t remember 
at all.” 

Maria said, “She told us a story 
today.” 

Mark added: “Before you came 
home. About this witch — ” 

Maria said, “ — that brings the 
presents to children. Her name is 
La Befana, the Christmas Witch.” 

Zozz drew his lips back from his 
double canines and jiggled his head. 
“I like stories.” 

“She says it’s almost Christmas 
and on Christmas three wise men 
went looking for the Baby and they 
stopped at the old witch’s door and 
they asked which way it was and 
she told them and they said come 
with us.” 

The door to the other room 
opened, and Teresa and Bananas’ 
mother came out. Bananas’ mother 
was holding a teakettle. She edged 
around Zozz to put it on the hook 
and swing it out over the fire. 

“And she was sweeping and she 
wouldn’t come,” Maria resumed. 

Mark added, “Said she’d come 
when she had finished. She was a 
real old, real ugly woman. Watch, 
I’ll show you how she walked.” He 
jumped up and began to hobble 
around the room. 

Bananas looked at his wife and 



indicated the wall. “What’s this?” 
“Some woman. I told you.” 

“In there?” 

“The charity place — they said she 
could stay there. She couldn’t stay 
in the house because all the rooms 
are full of men.” 

Maria was saying, “So when she 
was all done, she went looking for 
Him only she couldn’t find Him 
and she never did.” 

“She’s sick?” 

“She’s knocked up, Johnny, 
that’s all. Don’t worry about her. 
She’s got some guy in there with 
her.” 

Mark asked, “Do you know 
about the Baby Jesus — do you, Mr. 
Zozz?” 

Zozz groped for words. 

“Johnny, my son — ” 

“Yes, mama.” 

“Your friend — Do they have the 
faith here, Johnny?” 

Apropos of nothing Teresa said, 
“They’re Jews, next door.” 

Zozz told Mark, “You see, the 
Baby Jesus has never come to my 
world.” 

Maria said, “And so she goes all 
over every place looking for Him 
with her presents and she leaves 
some with every kid she finds, but 
she says it’s not because she thinks 
they might be Him like some 
people think but just a substitute. 
She can’t never die. She has to do it 
forever, doesn’t she. Grandma?” 
The bent old woman said, “Not 
forever, dearest. Only until tomor- 
row night.” ★

SCIENCE FACT— AND SPECULATION 



IS THE 

STAR OF BETHLEHEM 

OBSERVABLE TODAY? 



ROBERTS. RICHARDSON 

Associate Director, Griffith Observatory 
Former staff member. Hale Observatory 



W HAT was the star of 
Bethlehem? Is there scientific 
evidence for its existence? If so, 
what is this evidence? Can we 
identify the star with any celestial 
object known today? May we ex- 
pect it to reappear as a visible star? 

Answers can be found to all these 
questions. But no provable answers. 
We can only guess and con- 
jecture — and continue the search. 

One definite statement can be 
made about the star. Any sug- 
gestion concerning it is sure to 
anger somebody. I speak from 
thirty years’ experience. 

We — I — wish to present a new 
candidate for the identity of the 
star. Which does not mean that I 
myself believe we have a final 



answer. I don’t. I emphasize again: 
proof is impossible. 

What the Bible tells us about the 
star of Bethlehem is little. It is men- 
tioned four times by Matthew, but 
without a word of description. No 
hint is given as to its position 
among the stars, its color or 
brightness. We generally think of 
the star as an exceptionally bright 
object, but we do so mostly because 
we are accustomed to seeing it 
brilliantly depicted bn Christmas 
cards and other yuletide ornaments. 
Still, the chances are that the star 
was on the bright side or it would 
not have caught the notice of 
ground observers unequipped with 
telescopes. 

It appeared at the time of Jesus’ 



77 





birth. But when was Jesus born? 
Somewhere between 4 and 7 b.c. is 
as close as we can fix the date. For 
our purposes we shall assume it to 
be 5 B.c. The anachronism that 
Jesus was born in the time we call 
Before Christ originated with the 
Roman monk, Dionysius Exiguus 
citca A. D. 556. Known now to be 
wrong, his chronological system of 
reckoning has become so firmly es- 
tablished there is little hope of 
changing it. 

If the year of Jesus’ birth is un- 
certain the day itself is hopelessly 
lost. December 25 was selected in 
the fourth century principally as a 
matter of expediency. On that date 
the Romans were occupied with 
their annual orgy of the Saturnalia 
and hence less likely to be 
concerned with the activities of the 
Christians. 

We can be sure the ancients were 
much more familiar with the 
constellations and other heavenly 
bodies than are people today. 
Today, because of smog and arti- 
ficial illumination, many people 
scarcely know the stars exist ex- 
cept by hearsay. There were no as- 
tronomers to inform our distant 
predecessors, only astrologers. As- 
tronomers today regard astrologers 
with contempt, the idea that we can 
foretell future events from the 
aspect of the celestial bodies being 
considered too ridiculous for 
serious discussion. But in biblical 
times astrologers were highly re- 
spected as Magi or “wise men,” as 



usually translated in English scrip- 
ture. The Magi were thoroughly fa- 
miliar with the constellations and 
the stars that form them — they 
could even predict the motions of 
the sun, the moon and the planets 
with fair accuracy. 

If we consider the star as a sign 
sent by God to announce the birth 
of Christ no explanation of its ap- 
pearance is necessary. Once we 
admit the supernatural, anything is 
possible. If we limit ourselves to 
scientific possibilities, however, 
only three are worthy of attention. 

1. Planets revolve around the sun 
in nearly circular orbits 
(for the purposes of the present dis- 
cussion) in nearly the same plane, 
the farther from the sun the slower 
their motion. We see them from the 
Earth, which itself is in motion. The 
Earth’s motion and other factors 
complicate the true situation 
enormously. Trying to disentangle 
a planet’s true motion as seen 
against the background of the dis- 
tant stars from its apparent mo- 
tions was a problem that baffled as- 
tronomers for centuries. 

But occasionally two or more 
planets appear close together on the 
celestial sphere and we say they are 
in “conjunction.”* They are ac- 
tually millions of miles apart, but if 
they are in nearly the same line of 
sight they give the impression of 
being virtually in contact. 

* Rigorously defined: when they have the same 
right ascension or celestial longitude.

GALAXY 




Early in the last century the 
German chronologist, C. L. Ideler, 
found Jupiter and Saturn to have 
been in conjunction three times in 7 
B.c. He believed the Magi in- 
terpreted the first conjunction as 
the sign that started them on their 
way to Jerusalem. The last con- 
junction was so close that to a 
nearsighted person the light of 
Jupiter and Saturn might have 
seemed blended into a single body. 
Dr. Ideler convinced himself that 
this triple conjunction established 
the birth of Christ as 7 b.c. 

A check by the Greenwich Obser- 
vatory revealed Dr. Ideler’s work 
was not as reliable as he had sup- 
posed. A triple conjunction of 
Jupiter and Saturn did indeed occur 
in 7 B.c. But even at their closest 
approach the two planets were 
separated by twice the distance of 
the full moon and so could not 
possibly have been mistaken for 
a single “star” or even touching 
or near-touching “stars,” despite 
the technical “conjunction.” The 
hypothesis of a close approach is in- 
genious but does not hold up when 
tested mathematically. 

2. Could a star of Bethlehem 
have been not a star, but a bright 
comet? The most famous bright pe- 
riodic comet is Halley’s, which 
makes a close approach to the 
Earth and its sun, on an average, 
every 77 years. The various returns 
of Halley’s comet have been de- 
termined by electronic computers 



back to 622.04 b.c. At practically 
every return there is a record of a 
bright comet in the right part of the 
sky at the right time. Halley’s 
comet was last near us in 1910 and 
will next be nearest the sun on Feb- 
ruary 9, 1986. The coming appa- 
rition will be a poor one — the 
comet will not be favorably 
placed for observation. 

One of the earliest and best 
authenticated appearances of 
Halley’s comet occurred in 1 1 b.c. 
A bright comet is an unusual ob- 
ject, sure to arouse widespread awe 
and wonder. Although the date is 
four years before the earliest limit 
set for Jesus’ birth, so much un- 
certainty is involved in this event 
that the discrepancy is not in- 
tolerably large. 

But the fact remains that the evi- 
dence does not quite fit. Besides, 
the Bible reports successive reap- 
pearances of the “star.” 

3. The most satisfactory type of 
celestial object for the star of 
Bethlehem to have been is a nova or 
“new star. ’By a new star we do not 
mean one previously nonexistent, 
but simply one of which we have 
been unaware. It was there all the 
time but indistinguishable from 
myriads of other faint telescopic 
objects. For reasons unknown a 
star becomes unstable and, in 
perhaps a day or two, increases ten- 
or a hundred-thousand-fold in lu- 
minosity. After reaching maximum 
light it begins to fade and after a 



STAR OF BETHLEHEM 



79 




week or so sinks below naked-eye 
visibility. The flareup seems to be 
of a superficial nature, affecting 
only the outer layers of the star. 

Such novae are not rare ob- 
jects — about five are picked up 
every year and probably a dozen 
more go undetected. Usually we see 
only those close enough to attain 
naked-eye visibility. 

Much rarer objects, probably of a 
different nature, are the super- 
novae, which undergo sudden in- 
creases in luminosity of perhaps a 
billion-fold. Observations in the 
Milky Way and other galaxies indi- 
cate they occur at the rate of one in 
356 years on the average, although 
some oriental scholars find an 
average of one every 156 years. 

Supernovae have been recorded 
with certainty in the Milky Way in 
A.D. 1054, 1572 and 1604. Around 
maximum light they were so bright 
as to be visible in full daylight. (The 
supernova of 1054 has been 
identified from Chinese and 
Japanese records with the object in 
Taurus we call the Crab Nebula. It 
seems incredible that there is not a 
single reference to this brilliant ob- 
ject in surviving European records 
of that period.) 

A nova fits all the conditions for 
the star of Bethlehem. It appears 
unexpectedly. Occurring suffi- 
ciently close to Earth, it would 
have been sure to attract the at- 
tention of the Magi. It rapidly fades 
from sight — and this would account 
for its invisibility today. Only one 



slight difficulty is involved^ — until 
recently we had no record of a nova 
at the time of the birth of Christ. 

In 1966 a list of 90 novae and 
possible supernovae — derived from 
oriental sources between the 
fourteenth century b.c. and 
1690** — was published. Of special 
interest are Numbers 8 and 9, 
recorded in 5 b.c. and 4 b.c., re- 
spectively. No position is given for 
Number 8 except that it originated 
in the southern constellation of 
Capricornus. Number 9 occurred in 
Aquila at right ascension (RA) 19h 
50*^, declination (Dec.) 10° N. 



ATTHEW tells us that . 
the star, which they saw in 
the east, went before them, till it 
came and stood over where the 
young child was.” This would mean 
that the star of Bethlehem was at 
the zenith of Bethlehem. To be in 
the zenith the declination of a star 
must be the same as the latitude of 
the place, which is 31°.6 for 
Bethlehem. This immediately rules 
out nova Number 8 in Capricornus, 
which is much too far south of the 
celestial equator. 

Nova Number 9 is more hopeful 
with a declination of 10° N. When 
highest in the sky at Bethlehem, or 
on the meridian, it would be 26° 
south of the zenith, or at an altitude

of 64° above the horizon. But eye 
estimates of altitude — even by ex- 
perienced observers — are not 
trustworthy. Most people will 
describe an object with an altitude 
greater than 50° as being 
“overhead.” 

Now, the basic reference point of 
astronomers is the vernal equinox, 
corresponding to Earth’s zero meri- 
dian through Greenwich, England. 

However, the celestial “meri-

enormous hoops, the hour-circles 
travel across the sky from east to 
west. Point where sun crosses ce-

dicates the prime hour-circle through 
the vernal equinox. Note derivation

dian” is continually moving 
westward. We call this westward 
motion “precession.” and it results 
from the gradual change in the di- 
rection of the Earth’s axis of 
rotation in space, akin to the wob- 
bling motion of a spinning top. It 
arises from the gravitational action 
of the sun and moon on the equa- 
torial bulge of the Earth, which like 
a top is also spinning. At present a 
line through the north pole along 
the Earth’s axis extended passes 
near the star Alpha Ursae Minoris 
at the end of the handle of the Little 
Dipper. We call this star our Po- 
laris. But it was not always so. Four 
thousand years ago Alpha Draconis 
was our Polaris and in a.d. 13,500 
it will be the bright star Vega. After 
25,700 years the Earth’s axis will 
have come full circle and returned 
again to Alpha Ursae Minoris. 

As the Earth’s axis shifts position 
there is a corresponding change in 
the position of the constellations 
and the seasons in which we are 
used to seeing them. Today we 
regard Orion as a winter 
constellation and Scorpius as a 
summer constellation, but in a.d. 
15,000 this situation will be 
reversed. The constellation of the 
Southern Cross is now visible from 
only the southernmost part of the 
United States, but there was a time 
when it was visible as far north as 
the Aleutian Islands. 

How did the constellations ap- 
pear from Bethlehem in 4 b.c. as 
compared with today? In par- 



82 



GALAXY 




ticular, how was the position of the 
alleged nova in Aquila affected? 

Calculations show that pre- 
cession worked the wrong way to be 
helpful, moving the nova farther 
toward the south. In 4 b.c. it would 
have been 27° from the zenith of 
Bethlehem, hardly “overhead” to 
such sophisticated observers as the 
Magi. 

Thus we seem to have exhausted 
all the possibilities. Not a con- 
junction of the planets, not Halley’s 
comet, not the doubtful record of a 
nova satisfactorily fulfills the re- 
quired conditions. 

That brings us, at last, to my own 
proposal. 

T he ordinary novae we have 
mentioned are often called 
“flash” novae. They flash to 
prominence, then fade slowly back 
into obscurity. Other objects are 
known, however, called recurrent 
novae which have undergone two, 
three and four flareups. Their 
outbursts occur irregularly at inter- 
vals of several decades and have a 
smaller range in luminosity than 
the ordinary variety. 

Could the star of Bethlehem have 
been a recurrent nova? 

The most likely possibility for 
this conjecture is an object in the 
little circlet of stars forming the 
constellation of Corona Borealis, 
the Northern Crown. The first 
known outburst of this object called 
T Coronae Borealis (T Cor Bor) 



was observed on May 12, 1866, 
when it reached second magnitude, 
about the same brightness as the 
brightest stars in the Big Dipper. (A 
star barely visible to the unaided 
eye under favorable conditions is 
sixth magnitude; a bright star such 
as Vega is 0.14 magnitudes; the 
planet Venus at maximum 
brightness is magnitude 4.4 and 
visible in full daylight if you know 
exactly where to look.) 

The second outburst of T Cor 
Bor was first seen on Feb. 9, 1946, 
when its magnitude was 3.2. On 
both occasions the star fell below 
naked-eye visibility after about a 
week. But the light curves from 
telescopic observations for both 
1866 and 1946 were remarkably 
similar. 

The 1950 position of T Cor 
Bor was RA 1 5 h 51 ^, Dec. 26°. 1 N. 
How does precession affect the 
position of objects in this part of the 
sky? Using an approximate for- 
mula we find RA (5 b.c.) 14h 35>ri, 
Dec. 31°.7 N. The latitude of 
Bethlehem is 31°.6. Thus in 5 B. c., 
T Cor Bor would have passed 
through the zenith of Bethlehem. 
(The exact agreement between the 
latitude of Bethlehem and the decli- 
nation of T Cor Bor in 5 b. c. is 
purely accidental and of no signifi- 
cance whatever.) 

Since we used the approximate 
instead of the rigorous formulae in 
calculating the precession for T Cor 
Bor, it is desirable to have some 
check on our results. Fortunately 



STAR OF BETHLEHEM 



83 




we have an easy test. Theory shows 
that precession changes the RA, 
Dec., and celestial longitude of an 
object, but not its celestial latitude. 
That is, the celestial latitude of T 
Cor Bor in 1950 should be the same 
as its celestial latitude in 5 b. c. 

Applying this check we find. 
Celestial latitude T Cor Bor 
(1950);+45°.3. 

Celestial latitude T Cor Bor (5 
B.C.): -1-44.0 — which is as good 
agreement as we can expect from 
such rough work. 



K nowing the right ascension 
of T Cor Bor in 5 b. c., allows 
us to make a guess at the date of 
Jesus’ birth. 

Suppose Jesus were born at 10 p. 
M., local apparent time, when T Cor 
Bor at RA 14h 35"^ was on the me- 
ridian of Bethlehem. This would 



make the RA of the sun 14h 35^, 
which would have been in early 
June. But, as mentioned earlies, 
there is no actual evidence to 
indicate that Jesus was born in 
winter rather than summer. 

Finally, the appearance of a new 
star in Corona Borealis, a 
constellation representing a crown 
or halo, might have had a symbolic 
effect in heralding the birth of 
the new king. 

If. ..//... T Cor Bor is the star 
of Bethlehem, then this famous ob- 
ject may still be observed today. 
With a suitable star chart it can be 
identified as a faint star (magnitude 
10.0 currently) in the field of a 
three-inch telescope. 

Will T Cor Bor blaze up again? I 
should say it almost certainly will. 
When? Tomorrow night? Next 
year? The next century? Nobody 
knows. 



IS THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM 
OBSERVABLE TODAY? A COMMENT 



Rev. Ronald E. Royer 

St. Frances Catholic Church 
Azusa, California 



T he Christian belief that the 
Supreme Being entered His 
natural world to raise us above our 
natural condition certainly leaves 
room for God to use a natural 
phenomenon to announce this 
supernatural event. Though it is 
easier to describe the Star of 



Bethlehem as a total miracle, to do 
so does not seem quite in line with 
the nature of the total event of the 
Incarnation, which is a fusion of the 
natural and the supernatural. So I 
find Richardson’s review of this 
problem as orthodox as it is 
resourceful. 



84 



GALAXY 




As a parish priest I am an 
amateur in Scripture research as 
well as in astronomy. ’ But my 
readings do indicate that the non- 
Jewish world knew of the Jewish 
expectation of a Messiah because of 
the ancient prophecies. The 
“Magi,” who lived somewhere to 
the East were among those 
awaiting some sign of the coming of 
the Messiah. What better sign for 
them than a new star in the 
heavenly crown, Corona Borealis? 
We know that a crown was a sign of 
kingship at that time since Jesus 
Christ received one for His pro- 
claimed kingship, though it was of 
thorns. Unfortunately we do not 
know how these Magi read the 
circlet of stars — but if they did read 
it as a crown the new star’s position 
in the constellation as well as its de- 
clination would be most significant 
for them. So Richardson’s nomi- 
nation of T Cor Bor stands this test 
pretty well. 

But how does T Cor Bor stand 
the more difficult test of the second 
appearance recorded by Saint Mat- 
thew, Chapter 2, vs. 9? It fails per- 
fectly. T Cor Bor just isn’t visible 
long enough. Of course the other 
candidates for the Star of 

Bethlehem fail this test also, but not 
as perfectly as T Cor Bor. From 
this and the action of the star 
leading the Magi to the dwelling of 
the Holy Family, those who do 
admit of a natural celestial 

phenomenon’s starting the Magi 
out on their journey tend to believe 



that the second appearance was mi- 
raculous, pure and simple. 

But as I studied the light curve of 
T Cor Bor (page 80) I became in- 
trigued by the secondary maximum 
some four months after outburst. In 
our very limited experience with 
recurrent novae — and especially in 
this area — this secondary outburst 
has not reached naked-eye visi- 
bility. But could it vary — could it 
have done so for the Magi? If God 
willed, yes. But a variation in its 
natural cycle may also be possible. 

Assuming then that T Cor Bor 
did again reach naked-eye visibility 
for the Magi, the four-month in- 
terval fits well with the preparation 
and travel time required for the 
Magi. We know that they came no 
sooner than forty days after the 
birth of Christ since the purification 
period Saint Luke talks about is 
forty days (Luke 2:22). Herod’s 
massacre of the Innocents actually 
indicates an arrival of several 
months after the birth of Christ. 

So we still have T Cor Bor in the 
running, but how about the star’s 
having led the Magi to Bethlehem? 
Matthew 2:5 tells us that the ar- 
dent prophecies did that, not the 
star. Its reappearance only con- 
firmed that they were on the right 
track. 

The real difficulty here is that 
Matthew seems to have the star ac- 
tually leading to the dwelling of the 
Holy Family, an impossibility for 
any extraterrestrial object. If T Cor 
Bor is our Star of Bethlehem we 



STAR OF BETHLEHEM 



85 




have to read Matthew 2:9 as a 
layman’s description of a zenith 
passage. In that case, it is not too 
far-fetched to consider that the in- 
habitants of Bethlehem pointed out 
to the Magi the exact place where 
lived the child whose birth had 
caused such a stir a few months 
back. 

Maybe I am stretching the bib- 
lical text a little bit to fit T Cor Bor 
into this new theory. Please excuse 
me, but I have made many esti- 



mates of the brightness of T Cor 
Bor in the past nineteen years for 
the American Association of 
Variable Star Observers. I was very 
much excited when Robert 
Richardson talked to me about its 
candidacy — could I all this time 
have been seeing the actual star of 
Bethlehem? At any rate, those who 
look closely at the stars and think 
about them may still be led to adore 
the Lord as were these mysterious 
heaven-gazers from out of the East.^

and cryogenic sperm banks, there is very little that space permits us to say 
about the environmental struggle - except we’re in it up to our gas masks.

PROJECT 

40 



PART TWO 



WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

Story opens with undercover agent 
CARLOS DEPEAUX trying to blend 
with southeast Oregon scenery while 
keeping a careful watch on an innoc- 
uous farmhouse through powerful bi- 
noculars. Some distance away his 
fellow agent, a girl named TYMIENA, 
keeps the farm under electronic and 
radar surveillance from a specially 
equipped van camper. Ostensibly 
CARLOS and TYMIENA are nature- 
loving husband and wife on a camper 



vacation — CARLOS is a birdwatcher, 
if anyone should ask. 

He is, however, chilled by a growing 
awareness that he is the only life 
form — other than plants — in the 
vicinity of the farm. There are no birds, 
no animals small or large, not even 
insects around. Adding to his unease is 
the knowledge that his predecessor, 
PORTER, vanished without a trace 
while watching this same lack-life 
farm. Carlos knows, of course, that 
the farm’s proprietor, NILS 
HELLSTROM, is no farmer, but is 
noted for making documentary films 
about insects. He is also suspected of 
being in the process of developing a 
superweapon that would give world do- 
minion to any nation possessing 
it — and no one is quite sure of 
HELLSTROM’ S loyalties. The 
weapon is described as a ” toroidal field 
disruptor,” is capable of altering mat- 
ter over great distances and its exis- 
tence has been deduced from specifica- 
tions that a HELLSTROM aide 
inadvertently left in an MIT library. 
The specs were labeled: Project 40. 

CARLOS and TYMIENA are em- 
ployed — as was PORTER — by a 
Government “Agency” so top-secret it 
has no other name. It is headed by a 
man equally nameless, who is 
responsible only to the President — not 
even to God. His aide is totally 
ruthless, physically powerful, top-level 
I.Q. DztjLE PERUGE; operations di- 
rector is a nonentity named JOSEPH 
MERRIVALE. 

What the Agency does not know is 
that Hellstrom heads a 300-year-old 
cult of humans who have patterned 
their culture, genetics and thought 
processes upon those of insects as a sur- 
vival measure. Bred for intelligence, 
cult members have infiltrated society at 



large at all levels of authority, including 
branches of Government. 

A small nation of HELLSTROM’ S 
subjects lives underground in the 
honeycombed hill — or Hive — under 
HELLSTROM’S farm. The Hive’s 
main objective for centuries has been to 
become impregnable. Its weaponry and 
science surpass anything found outside. 
Each individual in it is an experti bred 
for a single specialty for generations. 
Life expectancy in the Hive is several 
times the “wild” human lifespan. 

CARLOS and TYMIENA are cap- 
tured by the Hive and the Agency sends 
a small task force headed by DZULE 
PERUGE himself, seconded by top 
agents EDWARD JANVERT and his 
girl, CLOVIS CARR, to investigate 
the latest disappearance. 



XI 

General memo from Joseph 
Merrivale: Whether Porter, 

Depeaux and Grinelli are ac- 
tually dead is unimportant for 
these present considerations. 
Although we presume they are 
dead, nothing is changed if they 
are only missing. We have 
learned that Hellstrom will not 
hesitate to act against us. In 
view of his frequent overseas 
trips, ostensibly in pursuit of 
his insect films, a renewed ef- 
fort to assess his foreign 
contacts is indicated. His 
ruthless actions bear a certain 
familiar stamp. On the home 
front the problem is more com- 
plex. Because we cannot admit 



90 



GALAXY 




the purposes that prompted our 
investigation we cannot now 
proceed through ordinary 
channels. Suggestions on al- 
ternate procedures will be 
welcomed. Destroy this entire 
message immediately after 
reading. This is mandatory. Do 
it now. 

(Appended comment by 
Dzule Peruge with cover — for 
the Chiefs eyes only: Nuts! 
I’m opening several straight- 
forward inquiries. I want an 
examination of that film com- 
pany along every avenue we 
can open. My approach in 
Oregon will be to launch a 
missing-person inquiry through 
every agency I can reach. FBI 
assistance will be solicited. 
Your help there would be ap- 
preciated. — Dzule.) 

J ANVERT did not bring up the 
subject of their companions in 
this project until he and Clovis were 
on the plane headed west. He had 
chosen seats well forward of the 
others and on the left side. The 
window beside him gave a good 
view of a sensational sunset over 
the left wing, but he ignored it. 

As expected, he and Clovis had 
been ordered to assume teenage 
guise — and Nick Myerlie, whom 
both of them considered to be an 
ineffectual ass, had been named to 
cover as their father. What none of 
them had expected was that Janvert 
would be selected for the number- 
two spot in charge of the outing. 

He and Clovis held their heads 
close together, speaking in barely 
audible whispers. 

“I don’t like it,” Janvert said. 



“Peruge will hit the ceiling and 
choose someone else once we’re in 
the field.” 

“What good would that do him?” 
“I don’t know, but you wait and 
see. Tomorrow at the latest.” 

“This arrangement could be 
in recognition of your sterling 
qualities.” 

“Shit!” 

“Don’t you want the second 
spot?” 

“Not on this merry-go-round.” 
His lips set in a stubborn line. “This 
one’s a nasty.” 

“You think they’re looking for a 
scapegoat?” 

“Don’t you?” 

“It’s possible. How do you get 
along with Peruge?” 

“Not badly, considering.” 
“Considering what?” 

“The fact that he doesn’t trust 
me.” 

“Eddie!” 

One of their teammates took this 
moment to wander past, headed for 
the forward toilets. The teammate 
was an ex-gunner from the Vietnam 
war (he called it “Nam”) named 
Daniel Thomas Alden and everyone 
called him DT. Janvert remained 
silent while DT passed, noting the 
hard, youthful face, the square and 
deeply tanned line of jaw. There 
was a white scar at the bridge of his 
nose and he affected a flight cap 
with transparent green visor that 
imparted a dark green cast to his 
face. Janvert suspected DT of being 
a spy for the brass. Rumor had it he 
was shacking up with Tymiena, and 
Janvert found himself suddenly 
wondering what the younger man 
was thinking now. 

As he passed, DT glanced at 



PROJECT 40 



91 




Janvert, but gave no sign of 
recognition. 

Janvert whispered, “Do you sup- 
pose DT enjoys this work?” 

“Why?” 

“You’d think he would find it a 
bit more constraining than an ac- 
tual war — not as many chances to 
kill people.” 

“Sometimes you’re too damned 
bitter.” 

“And you shouldn’t be on this 
assignment at all, honey,” Janvert 
said, “Why didn’t you beg off?” 
“I thought you might need 
someone to defend you.” 

“The way you did last night?” 

She ignored the allusion, asked, 
“Have you heard the talk about DT 
and Tymiena?” 

“Yes. I almost feel sorry for 
him.” 

“You think she’s — gone?” 

“I don’t want to think about 
it — but yes, I do.” 

“But why? Couldn’t they all Just 
be — held somewhere?” 

“I can smell death in this one. 
Those missing people were the 
shock troops. You expect casualties 
with shock troops.” 

“What are we then?” 

“With Peruge along? I don’t 
know. I’ll tell you when I find out 
how he deploys us.” 

“Front line or rear?” 

“Right.” 

“Aren’t they going to serve din- 
ner on this flight?” she asked. 

“Those stewardi are too 
interested in getting our ‘elders’ 
drunk.” 

“That’s one of the things I hate 
about playing the kiddie role,” she 
whispered. “I can’t ask for a 
drink.” 



“I hate the makeup,” he said. 
“I’ll bet they don’t feed us before 
Nebraska.” 

“This is a bean-and-cod special,” 
she said. “They’ll give us fishballs 
and haricot. Are you still feeling 
low?” 

“Honey, forget some of the 
things I said last night. I was feeling 
like the very end.” 

“To be strictly accurate, there 
were two of us in that mood. It’s 
probably the phase of the moon.” 

“I still don’t know a good reason 
why I was named Number Two on 
this case — do you?” 

“None I’m sure of” And almost 
as an afterthought: “The others are 
pretty old.” 

“All the more reason — I mean, 
why would they want a younger 
agent in command?” 

“Youth must have its day,” she 
whispered and bent to nibble his 
ear. “Knock it off, darling. The old 
goat right behind me is trying to 
eavesdrop.” 

Janvert knew better than to 
glance back at once, but he 
straightened presently and glanced 
around the crowded aircraft. The 
lights were on now and it was dark 
outside — each window was a patch 
of black. The white-haired old man 
behind Clovis was reading Time 
while drinking a whiskey over ice. 
He looked up as Janvert turned 
around, but immediately went back 
to his magazine and drink. Janvert 
could not recall ever having seen 
him before — still, the old man 
could be spying for someone. 

Angrily Janvert sank back into 
his seat, bent close to Clovis. 
“Honey, we’ve got to break away 
from this racket. There must be a 



92 



GALAXY 




country somewhere that would be 
safe for us. There must be some 
place where the Agency can’t reach 
us.” 

“The other side?” 

“You know what that would 
mean — more of the same only in a 
foreign language. No — we need a 
nice tidy little foreign country 
where we can blend into the popu- 
lation without being noticed. It has 
to exist somewhere on this dirty 
planet.” 

“You’re thinking about DT and 
Tymiena.” 

“I’m thinking about you and 
me. 

“He’s listening again,” she whis- 
pered. 

Janvert folded his arms and sank 
into a sullen silence. It was going to 
be a bitch of a flight all the way to 
Portland. He resigned himself to it. 

Later, when Nick Myerlie came 
past and bent over them to ask; 
“You kids getting along okay?” 
Janvert merely growled at him. 

Inter-Hive Memo — Project 40: 
The heat problem remains 
severe. Our latest model 
melted before becoming fully 
operational. Secondary reso- 
nance was measurable, how- 
ever, and it was climbing 
toward the expected peaks. If 
the proposed new cooling tech- 
niques are successful we should 
get our first fully operational 
tests within the month. The test 
is sure to cause manifestations 
that will be noticeable Outside. 
At the minimum we can expect 
a new island to appear in the 
Pacific Ocean somewhere off 
Japan. 



P ^ERUGE caught a late flight 
out of Dulles and was forced to 
accept coach, which compounded 
his annoyance over the conference 
with Merrivale. The Chief had 
insisted he have that meeting, 
however, and Peruge had seen no 
good way to avoid it. He had driven 
over to Operations after preparing 
the way with a call and had met 
Merrivale in the latter’s office. The 
gloves had been off right from the 
beginning. 

Merrivale had glanced up 
without change of expression as Pe- 
ruge strode into the office. There 
was a pinched up, frightened look 
around Merrivale’s eyes and Pe- 
ruge thought. He knows he’s been 
nominated for patsy. 

Peruge seated himself across 
from Merrivale in one of the big 
leather chairs, indicated a folder on 
the desk. “You’re reviewing the 
reports, 1 see. Found any holes in 
them yet?” 

Merrivale obviously thought the 
question put him at a disadvantage. 
“My reports are precisely fitted to 
the circumstances for which they 
were made.” 

The pompous bastard! 

Peruge was well aware that his 
presence annoyed Merrivale. It al- 
ways did. Peruge was physically a 
big man — many said he would be 
gross if he ever let himself go to 
fat. But he possessed a softly 
sinister grace of movement which, 
coupled with his size, never failed to 
irritate Merrivale. 

“The Chief wanted me to ask you 
why you gave second spot on the 
assignment to that little shrimp, 
Janvert,” Peruge said, needling 
Merrivale again. 



PROJECT 40 



93 




“Because he’s long overdue for 
responsibility.” 

“He’s not trustworthy.” 
“Nonsense!” 

“Why didn’t you delay and let me 
appoint my own second?” 

“No sense in delay. The briefing 
had to proceed.” 

“So you rushed into another mis- 
take,” Peruge said. His voice 
conveyed a sense of calm, superior 
knowledge. That mention of the 
Chief had been telling. Merrivale’s 
face darkened. 

“Why are you going out to 
Oregon yourself?” 

“The answer to that is obvious, 
given the situation.” 

“What situation?” 

“Three of our best people have 
been lost.” 

Merrivale nodded. Then: “You 
spoke of something important to 
discuss with me. What is it?” 
“Several things. First, that memo 
you circulated indicated that we 
were unsure of our next step in this 
case. The Chief was rather upset by 
that.” 

Merrivale actually paled. 

“We — the circumstances — ” 
Peruge interrupted as though he 
hadn’t heard Merrivale. “Second, 
we are concerned about the instruc- 
tions you gave those three agents. It 
seems strange to us that — ” 

“I followed my bloody orders to 
the letter!” Merrivale said, slam- 
ming a hand onto the folder. 

The story of his life, Peruge 
thought. He said, “There are ru- 
mors that Tymiena didn’t like this 
assignment.” 

Merrivale sniffed, managed to 
look unimpressed. “They always 
object and then talk about it behind 



my back. What good are rumors?” 

“I got enough hints to convince 
me she may have had a valid ob- 
jection to the way things were being 
handled. Did she talk about specific 
objections.” 

“We talked, yes. She thought we 
should go in openly after 
Porter — make a more official ap- 
proach.” 

“Why?” 

“It was just a feeling she had, 
nothing more.” Merrivale made 
feeling sound like a peculiar female 
foible. 

“That feeling appears to have 
been accurate. You should have lis- 
tened to her.” 

“She was always having those 
crazy hunches,” Merrivale ob- 
jected. “She didn’t like working 
with Carlos, for one thing.” 

“So she did have specific objec- 
tions. Why did she object to 
Carlos?” 

“I’m only guessing, but I 
presume he has made objectionable 
advances to her at some time. At 
any rate, that wasn’t the kind of 
quibble we tolerate in the Agency. 
They know the work they’re called 
upon to do and what it may entail.” 

Peruge just stared at him. Merri- 
vale’s face was an open page, his 
thoughts written across it for 
anyone to read: They’re blaming 
me for these losses. Why are they 
blaming me? I only did what they 
told me to do. 

Before Merrivale could begin 
giving voice to these thoughts Pe- 
ruge said, “There is pressure from 
farther up the line and we’re going 
to have some explaining to do. 
Your part in this comes in for par- 
ticular questioning.”

GALAXY 




M ERRIVALE got the whole 
picture now — there was 
pressure from higher up and 
someone was being, prepared as 
sacrificial goat. That goat was 
named Joseph Merrivale. The fact 
that he had successfully protected 
himself on many similar occasions 
did not ease his pain at finding him- 
self today’s target. 

“This is not fair,” Merrivale 
growled. “It is simply not fair.” 

“I’d like you to recount as much 
as you remember of your last con- 
versation with Tymiena,” Peruge 
said. “Everything.” 

Merrivale took a moment to 
regain his composure. Then; 
“Everything?” 

“Yes.” 

“Very well.” Merrivale’s mind 
was neatly organized and could re- 
produce most conversations from 
memory. He was hampered this 
time, however, by the necessity of 
screening every scrap through a 
self-protective analysis. He lost his 
fake British accent as he proceeded. 
Peruge found this amusing. 

Presently Peruge interrupted: 
“So she went looking for Carlos.” 
“Yes. Carlos was in Archives, 
I believe.” Merrivale wiped 
perspiration from his forehead. 

“It’s too bad we don’t have her 
here to question,” Peruge said. 

“I’ve told you everything.” 

“Oh, I believe you,” Peruge said. 
He shook his head. “But there still 
was something. She had read the 
reports and — ” He shrugged. 

“Agents do die in the line of 
duty,” Merrivale argued. 

“Of course, of course,” Peruge 
said. “Such occurrences are per- 
fectly ordinary.” 



Merrivale scowled, obviously 
thinking the facts were being 
twisted to damn him. 

“Carlos had no similar objec- 
tions?” Peruge asked. 

“None whatsoever.” 

Peruge pursed his lips in thought. 
Damnable business! So the little 
clerk had finally bought it. His 
legendary caution had failed him at 
last. Unless that caution had 
somehow pulled him through. 
Carlos might still be alive. 
Somehow Peruge did not give much 
weight to this possibility. The first 
pawn had been taken, then the 
second and the third. Now it was 
time for a more powerful piece. 

He asked, “Did Carlos and 
Tymiena quarrel about this job?” 
“Perhaps.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“They were always snapping at 
each other. Who noticed after a 
while?” 

“And we don’t have them here to 
ask,” Peruge mused. 

“I don’t need reminders of that.” 
“Do you recall what Carlos said 
when you last saw him?” 

“Certainly. He told me he would 
report within forty-eight hours of 
his arrival on the scene.” 

“Did they have radio?” 

“There was one in the van they 
picked up in Portland. They called 
in to check the equipment. That 
was from Klamath Falls. Portland 
relayed.” 

“Forty-eight hours, huh?” Pe- 
ruge muttered. “Why did he ask for 
that time spread?” 

“He wanted a chance to get set 
up on the scene — to reconnoiter the 
area and choose his observation 
site.” 



PROJECT 40 



95 




“Yes, but—” 

“That was not an unreasonable 
spread.” 

“But Carlos was always so cau- 
tious.” 

“This speaks of caution,” Merri- 
vale objected. 

“Why didn’t you order him to 
make more frequent periodic 
calls?” 

“It did not seem indicated.” 

Peruge shook his head from side 
to side. It was diabolic. A pack of 
amateurs would not have left this 
many loose ends and blunders be- 
hind them. Merrivale would admit 
no mistakes, though. And the man 
had those explicit orders to fall 
back on. Embarrassing. He would 
have to be shunted aside, though. 
He would have to be stored 
somewhere until the axe fell. Merri- 
vale was a miserable incompetent. 
There was no excuse for him. He 
was just the kind of man Peruge 
needed right now, someone to point 
to when the really embarrassing 
questions were asked. 

With angry abruptness Peruge 
pushed himself out of the chair, 
stood glowering down at Merrivale, 
who appeared thoroughly cowed. 

“You’re a fool, Merrivale,” Pe- 
ruge said in a cold, hard voice. 
“You’ve always been a fool and al- 
ways will be. We have a full report 
on Tymiena’s objections from DT. 
She wanted a backup team. She 
wanted frequent radio contact. You 
specifically told her not to bother 
Portland-relay unless the message 
was something vital. You told her 
she was to take her orders from 
Carlos and not to question them. 
You ordered her not to mount any 
official inquiry into what happened 



to Porter. Under no circumstances 
was she to move out from under her 
cover. Those were your instruc- 
tions.” Peruge pointed to the folder 
on Merrivale’s desk. “And you had 
read that!” 

Merrivale sat in shocked silence 
at the outburst. For a horrible 
moment he appeared about to cry. 
His eyes glistened with unshed 
tears. But he managed to respond 
with a semblance of his accent once 
more intact. 

“I say— you don’t leave your 
opinions in any doubt — ” 

I ATER, on the telephone from 
j the airport, Peruge said, “I 
suppose we ought to be grateful to 
him. There’s no doubt now of the 
situation we’re in.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
the Chief asked, his voice disgrun- 
tled. 

“I mean that we went in without 
knowing Hellstrom’s situation. 
Now we know it. He’s willing to 
play for high stakes.” 

“As though we weren’t.” 

“Well, I’ve settled with Merri- 
vale, at any rate. I ordered him to 
stand by for reassignment.” 

“He won’t do anything stupid?” 
“Hasn’t he done enough stupid 
things already?” 

“You know what I mean, dam- 
mit!” 

“I think he’ll obey his orders to 
the letter,” Peruge said. 

“But you upset him badly.” It 
was a statement, not a question. 

“No doubt of it.” This was an un- 
familiar tack and Peruge hesitated, 
staring thoughtfully at his scram- 
bler cap on the telephone. 

“He’s been on the phone to me,” 



96 



GALAXY 




the Chief said. “He complained 
about you bitterly. Then he said he 
was putting our written instructions 
to him in a safe place. He also 
made a point of telling me that he 
had given Janvert the special signal 
corps number and code letters, as 
per our instructions for supervising 
agents. He even quoted the section 
to me from some set of orders we 
gave him years ago.” 

After a long silence Peruge said, 
“We might have to take stronger 
measures with him.” 

“Yes, there’s always that,” the 
Chief said. 

XII 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
Unlike man whose physical 
limitations are dictated from 
the moment of his birth, the 
insect is born with the actual 
ability to improve upon his 
body. When he reaches the 
limits of his capability he mi- 
raculously transforms into an 
entirely new being. It is in this 
metamorphosis that I find the 
most basic pattern for my 
understanding of the Hive. To 
me the Hive is a cocoon from 
which the new human will 
emerge. 

H ellstrom sat thinking in 
his cell. His eyes were 
absently aware of the charts and 
diagrams pasted over his walls, the 
reassuring standby blink of his 
repeater console. But he was not ac- 
tually seeing these things. They’ll 
send in the first team now, he 
thought. They were just probing be- 
fore. Now we’ll get the real experts 



and from them we may learn 
enough to save ourselves. 

It had been a long night and a 
longer day. He had managed to get 
a two-hour nap, but the Hive was 
tense and twanging with crisis 
awareness. Body chemistry told the 
workers what was happening if 
nothing else told them. 

When he had returned to his cell 
a little more than two hours earlier 
Hellstrom had been so tired he had 
tossed his Outsider jacket onto a 
chair and just flopped on the bed in 
his clothes. Something heavy in a 
pocket of the jacket had been left 
hanging over an edge, however, and 
had dragged the jacket into a 
mound on the floor beside the 
chair. He could see the lump of the 
heavy object and abruptly remem- 
bered the Outsider pistol he had 
picked up before leaving his 
cell — how long ago? The incident 
not only seemed to belong to 
another lifetime — but to another 
universe. Everything had changed. 
Powerful Outside forces had 
developed an interest in something 
that was sure to lead them to the 
Hive. 

Project 40. 

The source of the leak appeared 
so innocent on the surface that 
Hellstrom shivered when he 
thought about it. Jerry, one of the 
cameramen, had been assigned to 
the MIT sequences and, as part of 
that assignment, had been charged 
to do a special research project in 
the library. He remembered leaving 
the papers on a table “for no more 
than a half-hour.” They had been in 
the same place when he had 
returned and he had collected them, 
thought no more about it. An in- 



PROJECT 40 



97 




nocent slip. But it had been all the 
Outsiders needed. They seemed to 
possess a malevolent genie who 
watched out to take advantage of 
such casual mistakes. 

Jerry was heartsick. He felt that 
he had betrayed his beloved Hive. 
And he had. But an accident had 
been bound to happen some day. 
The miracle was that the Hive had 
endured so long undetected. The 
peace of anonymity had its own life 
cycle, apparently. Peace at any 
price never quite worked out the 
way one hoped. There was always a 
higher price to pay. 

Feeling nervous and quite ir- 
ritable — emotions he knew his body 
would transmit like an invisible 
trail all along the way, but 
somehow not caring — Hellstrom 
arose suddenly, went down to check 
on Project 40. The Hive had to 
speed things up down there. 

It had to! 

Coded memo from Peruge: For 
the time being I will not change 
Janvert’s assignment. We must 
consider the delicate problem 
of a replacement for Merrivale. 
Certain aspects of Janvert’s 
enrollment in the Agency ap- 
peal to me in this regard. Our 
hold upon him could be made 
very firm. There appears to be 
no doubt of our observation 
that a strong attachment has 
developed between Janvert and 
Clovis Carr. This could be 
worked to our advantage. To 
be on the safe side I have com- 
missioned D. T. Alden to 
keep a special watch on both 
of them. A copy of his report 
will be forwarded to you. 



F )|ERUGE dumped his suitcase 
on the bed of the motel room on 
the outskirts of Fosterville. He had 
allowed himself only one small bag 
and a camera case with his commu- 
nications gear. The camera case he 
draped over a chair arm. It was the 
way he liked to travel — bags under 
the airplane seat, no airport fuss, in 
and out of an area with as little at- 
tention called to himself as 
possible. In spite of his six feet four 
inches of height, he knew he tended 
not to attract second glances. He 
had learned long ago a self-effacing 
diffidence of manner he could 
adopt when he needed it. He tended 
to put it on like a garment when 
traveling. 

It had taken him all morning to 
get the backup teams positioned in 
the mountains north of town, where 
they could operate line-of-sight 
communication to both his motel 
room and the observers at the farm. 
He was hungry for lunch, but there 
were things to be done first. He 
glanced around the room. It had 
been furnished in Grand Rapids 
Western — dark wood with imi- 
tation brand burns, a heavy-wear 
fabric for all upholstery. The place 
reeked of expense-account mini- 
mums. He sighed, dropped into a 
chair that creaked under his weight. 
One big hand found the telephone 
on the lamp table beside the chair 
and he dialed the motel office. 

Yes, they knew the number for 
the office of the local deputy 
sheriff. Was there trouble? 

Peruge explained that he had 
been asked by his company to make 
a missing-person inquiry. Mere 
routine. He had to listen to an in- 
volved explanation about the

town’s having only one deputy, but 
a good one, mind you. The sheriffs 
office was actually over at the 
county seat. Presently, by 
answering all of the probing, cu- 
rious questions with monosyllabic 
grunts, Peruge got the number he 
wanted and the motel office made 
the connection for him. Two 
minutes later he was discussing his 
problem with Deputy Lincoln 
Kraft, a man with a flat, almost 
characterless voice. 

“We’re reasonably sure they’re 
missing,” Peruge insisted. “Carlos 
was supposed to be back at work 
Monday and today’s Friday. That’s 
not like him. Very punctual, our 
Carlos.” 

“His wife, too, eh?” Kraft made 
this sound accusatory. 

“Men often take their wives with 
them on vacation,” Peruge said. He 
wondered then if that had been too 
flip for the local law. 

Kraft apparently missed the sar- 
casm. He said, “Yes, I guess they 
do at that. Seems kind of strange 
your company would send you 
looking around for these people, 
though.” 

“Carlos has one of our most im- 
portant routes,” Peruge explained. 
“We can’t let that sort of thing go 
by default. The competition moves 
right in on you, you know.” 

“Guess that’s right. What line of 
work did you say you were in?” 
Kraft asked. 

“I’m vice president of the Blue 
Devil Fireworks Corporation of 
Baltimore. It’s one of the biggest in 
the country. Carlos was one of our 
best salesmen.” 

“Was?” Kraft asked. “You got 
reasons you haven’t told me that 



make you believe he’s in real bad 
trouble?” 

“Nothing specific,” Peruge lied. 
“If s just that it isn’t like him not to 
show up when he’s supposed to.” 

“I see. Probably some real ordi- 
nary explanation behind this, but 
I’ll see what I can do. What makes 
you think he’s missing in this 
area?” 

“I received a letter from him. It 
mentioned a valley near Fosterville 
where he was going to look for 
scaled quail.” 

“For what?” 

“Scaled quail. It’s a bird that 
lives in arid land.” 

“Is he a hunter? He might have 
had a hunting accident and not been 
able to — ” 

“He didn’t hunt birds to kill 
them. He liked to watch them and 
study them — sort of an amateur 
ornithologist.” 

“Oh, one of those.” Kraft made 
the hobby sound faintly dis- 
reputable, perhaps reflecting on the 
man’s sex habits. “What’s the name 
of this valley?” 

“Guarded Valley. Do you know 
where it is?” 

Such a long silence ensued that 
Peruge became impatient. “You 
still there, Mr. Kraft?” he asked. 
“Yeah, I’m still here.” 

“Do you know that valley?” 
“Yeah. Sort of. That’s 
Hellstrom’s place.” 

“Whose place?” Peruge rather 
liked the fine air of misunder- 
standing he managed to impart to 
this question. 

“That’s Doc Hellstrom’s place. 
He owns that valley. Been in his 
family for years.” 

“I see. Well, perhaps this medical 



PROJECT 40 



99 




gentleman won’t mind if we make 
inquiries in his neighborhood.” 
“He’s not a hospital doctor,” 
Kraft said. “He’s a bug doctor. He 
studies bugs. Makes moving pic- 
tures about ’em.” 

“That shouldn’t make any dif- 
ference,” Peruge said. “Will you 
see to the inquiries, Mr. Kraft?” 
“You gotta come in and sign a 
formal request,” Kraft said. 
“Missing-person report. I got one 
of the forms around here some 
place. We haven’t had a missing 
person since the Angelas kid got 
herself lost on Steens Mountain. 
That wasn’t the same thing as your 
problem, of course. Didn’t need a 
missing-person report for that.” 

F ^ERUGE considered this 
response, beginning to wonder 
about this deputy. The Agency’s 
files showed quite a number of 
missing persons in the area over a 
period of some fifty years. All 
instances had reasonable explana- 
tions, but still — He decided that 
Kraft sounded nervous under that 
flat voice. Perhaps a little fishing 
would be in order. 

Peruge said, “I hope this doctor’s 
place isn’t dangerous. He doesn’t 
have poisonous insects around, 
does he?” 

“Might have a scorpion or two,” 
Kraft said, his voice brightening. 
“They can be mighty bad some- 
times. You got pictures of these 
missing persons?” 

“I have a photograph of Carlos 
and his wife — one he kept on his 
desk.” 

“That’s fine. Bring that along 
with you. Did you say they were in 
a camper?” 



“They had one of those big van 
campers — a Dodge. Carlos was 
very proud of it.” 

“Doesn’t seem a thing like that 
could just disappear.” 

Peruge agreed with him, asked 
how to find the deputy’s office. 

“You got a car?” Kraft asked. 

“I rented one back in Klamath 
Falls.” 

“This Carlos fellow must be 
pretty important to your com- 
pany.” 

“I’ve already told you he is,” Pe- 
ruge said, allowing a trace of 
testiness to appear in his voice. 

“They fly you all the way out 
here from Baltimore just to inquire 
about him?” 

Peruge took the handset away 
from his ear, stared at it. What 
gave with this country cop? He put 
the instrument back to his ear, said, 
“Carlos covered the whole West 
Coast for us. It’s important that we 
find out about him as soon as 
possible. If something’s happened 
to him we have to replace him im- 
mediately. The buying season is 
about to begin. I’ve already talked 
to the state patrol in Salem. They 
told me to contact the authorities 
here.” 

“Thought you said you got a car 
in Klamath Falls,” Kraft said. 

“I went that far by chartered 
plane,” Peruge said and waited 
with increasing interest for Kraft’s 
response. 

“Chartered plane? My, my. You 
could have flown right here and 
landed on our little dirt strip if 
you’d wanted. Why didn’t you do 
that?” 

So both of us are fishing, Peruge 
thought. Good. He wondered what 



100 



GALAXY 




Kraft’s response would be if the ex- 
planation included an account of 
how Peruge had missed connections 
in Portland and had been forced to 
rendezvous with his people in Kla- 
math Falls. 

“I don’t like these little country 
landing fields,” Peruge said. 

“Can’t say I blame you much for 
that, but this is a nice enough little 
field. You file a report with the 
state police in Salem?” Kraft’s tone 
was alert and probing. 

Good interrogation technique, 
Peruge thought. This country cop 
was no simpleton. 

“Yes, I did. Carlos had his van 
shipped to Portland for this va- 
cation and took it from there. The 
state police are making inquiries 
along the way. They have copies of 
this photograph.” 

“I see. Fireworks must be big 
business,” Kraft said. “You people 
are spending a lot of 
money — chartered airplanes and 
everything.” 

Peruge considered this, decided a 
barb was called for. He said, “We 
look after our people and hang the 
cost, Mr. Kraft. I hope you’ll start 
your inquiries as soon as possible. 
Now, how do I get to your office?” 

“You’re at the motel, eh?” 

“Yes.” 

Kraft told him to come out of his 
motel parking lot, turn right “like 
you were going to Lakeview” and 
come out to county road 14. “Hang 
a left there and come up to the new 
shopping center. You can see it 
from the highway. I got a little of- 
fice on the second floor. Everybody 
knows where it’s at.” 

“I’ll be right over,” Peruge said. 

“Just a minute, Mr. Peruge,” 



Kraft said. “You carrying any sky- 
rockets or firecrackers — things like 
that?” 

“Of course not.” Peruge 
managed to sound properly 
shocked while noting that Kraft 
had his name down correctly and 
was obviously on the official of- 
fensive. Did they think him una- 
ware of state laws on fireworks? 
He said, “We ship only through 
legal channels. Deputy Kraft. Our 
people carry photographs and order 
lists. If we broke laws we wouldn’t 
be in business very long. I find your 
question interesting, however.” 

“Just want to be sure you know 
our law,” Kraft explained. “We 
don’t take it kindly when people 
come around saying one of our 
folks may have caused harm to a 
visitor. You gotta be mighty — ” 

“I didn’t even suggest that,” Pe- 
ruge interrupted. “I take it as very 
interesting that you suggest it, 
however. Deputy Kraft. You can 
expect me in your office in just a 
few minutes.” 

Silence. Then; “Okay. Don’t 
forget that picture.” 

“I wouldn’t think of it.” 

Peruge sat staring at the 
telephone for a moment after 
hanging up. Presently he placed a 
call to Salem and told the state pa- 
trol he had talked by telephone with 
Deputy Sheriff Lincoln Kraft and 
asked if the patrol had anything to 
report. They had nothing to report. 
He called the Baltimore switch- 
board next and asked them to 
contact the FBI. This had been 
agreed upon as a code signal that he 
distrusted the local authorities and 
his office was to firm up the request 
for FBI assistance. 



PROJECT 40

He depressed the stem on his 
wristwatch transmitter then and felt 
the faint throbbing against his skin 
that told him the teams at the 
Steens Mountain campsites were 
on the job and monitoring his 
signal. Everything was in order. 
Time to begin bearding Hellstrom 
in his den. 

XIII 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
The living prototype of the 
computer was designed by 
nature long before man ever 
set foot on Earth. It is nothing 
more nor less than the termite 
mound, one of the first ex- 
periments in social order. It is 
a living reminder that all may 
not be as man would wish it 
among the life forms that share 
this planet with him. We all 
know, of course, that compared 
with man the insect does not 
display what we could describe 
as intelligence. But why should 
we feel proud about that? 
Where there is no intelligence 
there may be no stupidity. And 
the termite mound stands as a 
living accusation, a finger 
pointed at our pride. A com- 
puter is a mechanism pro- 
gramed with a thousand tiny 
bits of information. It operates 
by juggling information into a 
form of logic. Think about it. 
Is a beautifully functioning 
society not a form of logic? I 
say that the creatures of such 
a mound, each a bit of the 
whole, move through their 
hidden circuits, thousands of 
tiny particles of information 



organizing themselves into an 
indisputable form of logic. 
Their source of power is a 
broodmother, a queen. She 
represents a great throbbing 
mass of energy, motivating all 
around her with her insatiable 
need. Thus our Hive rests 
firmly on its breeding cham- 
bers. Within the queen’s pul- 
sating body lies the future of 
the mound. Within our breed- 
ing chambers lies our future 
and, in truth, the future of 
humankind. 

K raft called the farm as soon 
as Peruge had broken the 
connection. He had Hellstrom on 
the line within a minute. 

“Nils, there’s a fellow at the 
motel named Peruge. Says he’s 
from the Blue Devil Fireworks 
Company and he’s looking for a 
missing salesman and the 
salesman’s wife. Missing in your 
area. Says he has a letter from the 
salesman that mentions Guarded 
Valley. Should we know anything 
about that?’’ 

“I told you to expect this,” 
Hellstrom said. 

“I know, but this fellow sounds 
very sharp. He’s already talked to 
the state patrol and I wouldn’t be a 
bit surprised if he called in the 
FBI.” 

“Don’t you think you can handle 
him?” 

“I may’ve made him suspicious.” 
“How?” 

“I kept probing for some kind of 
admission from him that this 
wasn’t an ordinary missing persons 
case. He’s on his way over here 
right now. Says he has a pho- 



102 



GALAXY 




lograph of the missing couple. 
State patrol has a copy, too. FBI is 
sure to get another one. Some- 
body’s bound to have seen this pair 
and the search is going to center 
right here.” 

“Nobody will find anything at 
the farm,” Hellstrom said. He 
sounded sad and tired, and Kraft 
felt the first nigglings of a deeper 
concern. 

“I sure hope you’re right. What 
should I do?” 

“Do? Cooperate with him in 
every way. Take the photograph. 
Come up here to inquire.” 

“Nils, I don’t like this. I hope 
you’re — ” 

“I’m trying to keep the interface 
of our conflict as small as possible. 
Line. That is my most urgent 
concern.” 

“Yes, but what if he asks to tag 
along?” 

“I hope he does.” 

“But—” 

“Bring him.” 

“Nils, if I bring him up there with 
me — I hope he’s coming back with 
me.” 

“That is our concern. Line.” 

“Nils — I’m real worried. If 
he—” 

“I’ll handle it myself. Line. We’ll 
have everything smooth and ordi- 
nary here when you arrive.” 

“I sure hope so.” 

“How did he get to Fosterville, 
Line?” 

“Rented car.” 

“Is he alone?” 

“I don’t think so. There are 
several new campers up on the 
mountain.” 

“We noted the activity. Rented 
car, eh?” 



“Look, Nils, this guy had better 
not have an accident in that car. I 
got a funny feeling about this one. 
He’s big trouble.” 

“No doubt of it,” Hellstrom 
agreed. “They’ve sent in the first 
team.” 



From the Hive breeding 
record: This new group must be 
watched with extreme care. 
This includes all of the 
breeding batch designated 
Fractionated Actinomycin Nu- 
cleotide Complex Y-series 
(FANCY). While it offers us a 
great potential in several spe- 
cializations the Hive needs des- 
perately it may harbor a strain 
of instability. This instability 
may be evidenced in a 
heightened breeding drive, in 
which case it can be diverted 
to the Hive’s advantage. 
However, other symptoms may 
crop up and should be reported 
to Breeding Central immedi- 
ately. 

H ellstrom sat in reflective 
silence after the emergency 
meeting of his Council. He felt that 
the entire Hive had become what he 
imagined a hunted submarine to 
be — rigged for silent running. All 
power systems, including venti- 
lation, were operating at mini- 
mums. Water interchange with the 
deep underground river that ran the 
turbines and was the Hive’s major 
water source had been put under 
special observation to prevent 
anything from entering it that 
might arouse Outside suspicions 
when that water reached the Snake 
River system. 



PROJECT 40 



103 




How much did Peruge and his co- 
horts know about Project 40? 
Hellstrom wondered. The question 
had been left unanswered by the 
Council meeting. The Outsiders 
could not know everything about 
Project 40, nor was it likely they 
knew anything about the Hive as 
yet. Hellstrom felt confident of this. 
At the barest suspicion that some- 
thing like the Hive existed they 
would be in here with an army. 
Some accommodation had to be 
reached with these Outsiders before 
they learned too much. The deaths 
were regrettable, but they had 
followed as an inevitable conse- 
quence of Porter’s death. That had 
been an error. 

We lived too long in the security 
of our camouflage, he thought. We 
became too bold. Making films 
caused that — and all the necessary 
intimate arrangements with Out- 
siders that grew out of the films. 
We underestimated the Outsiders. 

Hellstrom suppressed a weary 
sigh. He missed Old Harvey. The 
present security team was a good 
one, but Old Harvey had possessed 
a special ability, a balancing 
wisdom. The Hive needed him now 
more than ever and all they had of 
Old Harvey’s legacy was his fa- 
vorite protege, Saldo. Did Saldo 
represent what came out of the vats 
new? Saldo had undergone a pro- 
found maturing since the night of 
the hunt. The transformation ap- 
peared to Hellstrom in some ways 
to resemble a metamorphosis. It 
was as though Saldo had really in- 
herited Old Harvey’s wide ex- 
perience and wisdom on that fatal 
night. Hellstrom knew he was 



leaning on Saldo for the same kind 
of support he had learned to expect 
from Old Harvey. Whether Saldo 
could bear up under these demands 
remained to be seen. So far he had 
shown bursts of brilliance and 
imagination, but Hellstrom shook 
his head. It was difficult to lean on 
such a young and untried member 
of the New Breed in a crisis. But 
whom else did he have? 

The Council meeting had started 
at noon in a screening room that 
occupied one entire corner of the 
barn studio. It was a room of 
outwardly conventional appear- 
ance — oval table flanked by mas- 
sive chairs. Hive-made of heavy 
extrusion plastic to counterfeit 
teak. A pulldown screen filled one 
end of the room. Speakers on each 
side of it clung to the high ceiling 
corners. A small double-glass 
window at the other end looked into 
the projection room. The walls were 
baffled and hung with loosely 
draped fabric to dampen sounds. 

S ALDO had remained behind the 
others at Hellstrom’s request. 
The bullet scar along his jawline 
had not completely healed. It stood 
out whitely against his dark skin. 
The hawkish features were relaxed, 
but there was a steady alertness in 
his brown eyes. Hellstrom recalled 
that Saldo was of the S 2 a -1 Series 
on the male side — this made him 
one of Hellstrom’s cousins. The 
younger man had been picked from 
prime drone stock, the source of all 
the breeding males. He had been 
subjected to all of the proper 
chemical reinforcements. And now 
Saldo represented a nice con- 



104 



GALAXY 




vergence of the functional traits 
upon which the Hive relied so 
heavily. 

“We must be prepared- at every 
level to respond quickly and 
thoroughly if anything goes 
wrong,” Hellstrom said, looking up 
and starting the conversation as 
though Saldo had shared the pre- 
ceding reverie. “I have sent 
messages to all of our fronts Out- 
side that they must be prepared to 
proceed on their own if we are lost. 
All records that allude to such 
fronts have been made ready for de- 
molition.” 

“But have we anticipated every 
contingency?” Saldo asked. 

“The question I’ve been asking 
myself.” 

“I know.” And Saldo thought: 
Our Prime Male is tried. He needs 
rest and we cannot give him that 
rest. Saldo felt at this moment ex- 
tremely protective toward Hell- 
strom. 

“Peruge probably will be car- 
rying special electronic equip- 
ment,” Hellstrom said. “At the 
very least he’ll be transmitting his 
position and condition to monitors 
Outside. I’m sure of it.” 

“To those people on the moun- 
tain.” 

“Yes. We must know the nature 
of his equipment as soon as 
possible.” 

“I’ve made all the preparations,” 
Saldo said. “Nils, shouldn’t you get 
some rest?” 

“No time. Peruge is on his way 
and he’s just the tip of the iceberg.” 

“The what?” 

Hellstrom explained the allusion. 
Then: “How many people do you 
think he has on the mountain?” 



“There are at least ten people 
camping up there. They could all be 
his.” 

“That many?” Hellstrom shook 
his head. 

Saldo nodded, sharing Hell- 
strom’s disquiet. The idea of 
more than ten people at once 
snooping into the Hive’s affairs 
created a profound disturbance of 
his inbred caution and condi- 
tioning. 

“Does Line have anyone he can 
send up the mountain to play 
camper with those others?” Saldo 
asked. 

“He’s looking into it.” 

“Line is bringing this Peruge per- 
sonally, isn’t he?” 

“Yes. But we mustn’t assume 
that Peruge trusts Line.” 

“Line was no match for this Pe- 
ruge — that’s obvious,” Saldo said. 
“I heard his account.” 

“Learn from that,” Hellstrom 
said. “It’s good to have our Outside 
fronts include a deputy sheriff, but 
a front creates its own problems. 
The more we expose of ourselves 
the more danger we’re in.” 

Saldo tucked this lesson into his 
memory. One did not deploy agents 
with complete impunity. The very 
existence of an agent carried its 
own message when that agent was 
exposed. The very fact that Peruge 
could suspect Lincoln Kraft re- 
vealed something about the Hive. 
Saldo vowed to remember this 
lesson when the present crisis was 
past. He had no doubt that the Hive 
would surmount the present diffi- 
culties. His trust in the Prime Male, 
Hellstrom, was profound. 

“Peruge may possess a device to 
reveal that we’re probing for his 



PROJECT 40 



105 




equipment,” Hellstrom said. 

“I have given instructions to 
monitor for that eventuality,” 
Saldo said. 

Hellstrom nodded, pleased. So 
far Saldo had anticipated every 
contingency that had arisen in 
Hellstrom’s own mind — and some 
that had not. Prime breeding stock 
always showed its worth in the 
crunch. Saldo possessed a pene- 
trating intelligence. The younger 
male would be of inestimable value 
to the Hive when he had been tem- 
pered and fully trained. 

‘‘What excuse have you prepared 
if he detects our probes?” 
Hellstrom asked. 

“I want to discuss that with you. 
Suppose, for the film in progress, 
we are making a sound-track with a 
great deal of complex mixing. It 
would be perfectly explainable 
electronic activity. The visit of this 
Peruge surely could not be expected 
to interrupt that. We have a 
schedule to keep. Any interference 
with Peruge’s equipment could be 
explained by this work,” 

Hellstrom nodded thoughtfully. 
‘‘Excellent. And if I ask him when 
he arrives if he has a radio be- 
cause — ” 

‘‘ — a radio would interfere with 
our equipment,” Saldo completed 
for him. ‘‘The question would be 
perfectly natural.” 

‘‘See to the cover preparations,” 
Hellstrom said. 

Saldo arose, stood with his 
fingertips touching the table, hesi- 
tating. 

“Yes?” Hellstrom asked. 

“Nils, are we sure the others 
didn’t have such equipment. I’ve 
been reviewing the tapes and 



records and — ” He shrugged, ob- 
viously loath to criticize. 

“We searched them. There was 
nothing.” 

“That seems odd — the fact that 
they didn’t carry such equipment.” 

“They weren’t considered im- 
portant enough,” Hellstrom said. 
“They were sent in to see if they 
would be killed.” 

“Ah.” Saldo’s expression be- 
trayed both understanding and 
shock. 

“We should have understood that 
about Outsiders,” Hellstrom said. 
“They are not very good humans, 
the wild ones. They commonly 
waste their workers this way. The 
ones who intruded here were ex- 
pendable stock. I know now that it 
would have been far wiser for us to 
confuse them and send them away 
with a believable story.” 

“It was a mistake to kill them?” 

“A mistake to make it necessary 
to kill them.” 

Saldo nodded his understanding 
of the fine distinction. “We made a 
mistake,” he said. 

“I made a mistake,” Hellstrom 
corrected him. “Too much success 
made me careless. We must always 
keep the possibility in mind that 
any of us can err.” 

The words of brood mother 
Trova Hellstrom: Let me intro- 
duce here a word about the 
quality we call caution. Where 
we say we have been and where 
we say the Hive is headed 
— somewhere in that myste- 
rious future — is by necessity 
somewhat removed from what 
we imagine are facts. Our own 
interpretation always inter- 



106 



GALAXY 




venes. What we say we are 
doing is inevitably modified 
by our own understanding and 
by the limits of our compre- 
hension. First, we are partisan. 
We see everything in terms of 
Hive survival. Second, the 
Universe has a way of ap- 
pearing to be one thing while 
it is actually something else. 
In this light caution becomes 
a reliance upon our deepest 
collective energies. We must 
trust the Hive itself to possess 
wisdom and to manifest that 
wisdom through us, its cells. 

W HEN they reached the point 
on the lower road where Pe- 
ruge could get his first look at 
Hellstrom’s farm he asked Kraft to 
stop. The deputy brought his 
station wagon to a skidding, dusty 
halt, peered questioningly at his 
passenger. 

“Something wrong, Mr. Pe- 
ruge?” 

Peruge merely tightened his lips. 
Kraft interested him. The deputy 
could have been type-cast for the 
role he played. It was almost as 
though someone had looked at him 
and said, Now, this one — we’ll 
make him the deputy. Kraft had a 
sunburned, western appearance, 
thick nose and beetling brows, pale 
yellow hair topped by a wide- 
brimmed hat. His squarish features 
surmounted a blocky body which 
moved with a stiff-legged 
horseman’s walk. Peruge had seen 
several people on Fosterville’s one 
main street who looked vaguely like 
Lincoln Kraft. 

Kraft accepted Peruge’s silent 
appraisal without qualms, secure in 



the knowledge that he was a Hive- 
hybrid whose appearance could not 
possibly excite questions about 
alien background. Kraft’s father 
had been a local rancher seduced in 
a gene foray by a breeding female. 
Many Fosterville locals had re- 
marked on Kraft’s resemblance to 
the father. 

Kraft cleared his throat and said, 
“Mr. Peruge, I said — ” 

“I know what you said.” 

Peruge glanced at his wristwatch. 
Its hands stood at quarter to three. 
Every delay imaginable had been 
thrown in the way of this ex- 
cursion — telephone calls, careful 
examination of the missing-person 
report, a lengthy study of the pho- 
tograph, question after question 
and a laborious assemblage of 
answers on paper, all executed in a 
slow and meticulous longhand. But 
here they were, finally, in sight of 
Hellstrom’s farm. Peruge felt his 
pulse quicken. The air carried a 
dry, cloying silence. Even the 
insects were still. Peruge sensed 
something out of character about 
the stillness. He grew aware slowly 
of the absence of insect sounds, 
asked Kraft about this. 

Kraft pushed back his hat, 
rubbed a sleeve across his forehead. 
“I expect someone’s used a spray.” 
“Really? Does Hellstrom do that 
sort of thing? I thought all the envi- 
ronmentalists were against sprays.” 
“How did you know the Doc was 
into ecology?” 

Sharp! Sharp! Peruge reminded 
himself. He said, “I didn’t know it. 
I just assumed an entomologist 
would have that as one of his 
concerns.” 

“Yeah? Well, maybe the Doc 



PROJECT 40 



107 




isn’t spraying. This is rangeland 
right here.” 

“Somebody else could be doing 
it?” 

“Maybe. Or the Doc could be 
doing something else. Did you have 
me stop just so you could listen?” 
“No. I want to get out and scout 
around the area and see if I can 
spot any sign of Carlos’ camper.” 
“Not much sense in that.” Kraft 
spoke quickly with an undertone of 
sharpness. 

“Oh? Why?” 

“If we decide he’s really been 
around here we’ll do a thorough 
search.” 

“I thought I told you,” Peruge 
said. “I’ve already decided he was 
around here. I’d like to get out and 
have a little look at the area.” 

“Doc don’t like people wandering 
around his place.” 

“But you said this was rangeland. 
Does he control it?” 

“Not exactly, but — ” 

“Then let’s have a look.” Peruge 
put a hand on the door. 

“You just wait a minute,” Kraft 
ordered. 

Peruge nodded silently. He had 
found out what he wanted to 
know — Kraft was here to block any 
investigation by strangers. 

“All right,” Peruge said. “Does 
Hellstrom know we’re coming?” 



XIV 

K raft had put the station 
wagon in gear, prepared to 
resume their lurching progress 
toward the farm, but now he hesi- 
tated. Peruge’s demand that they 
stop had shocked him. The first 



thought had been that the Outsider 
had seen something suspicious, 
something overlooked by the Hive’s 
cleanup workers. Peruge’s attempts 
to get out and search the area had 
done nothing to ease that initial dis- 
quiet. Now it occurred to Kraft 
that Peruge or his people might 
have tapped the telephone to the 
farm. But Hive Security was always 
wary of that — surely it would have 
detected such an intrusion. 

“Matter of fact, he does know,” 
Kraft said. “I called to make sure 
Doc was here himself. Sometimes 
he goes gadding off to mighty 
strange places. And I wanted to 
clear it that we were coming. You 
know how these scientists are.” 
“No. How are they?” 

“They do experiments some- 
times. Outsiders go blundering in 
and upset everything.” 

“Is that why you don’t want me 
to get out here?” 

Kraft spoke with obvious relief. 
“Sure it is. Besides, the Doc makes 
movies up here all the time. He gets 
a bit testy if you ruin his pictures. 
We try to be good neighbors.” 
“You’d think he’d put out guards 
or something.” 

“No. The locals all know about 
his work. We steer clear of his 
place.” 

“How testy does he get if one 
ruins his experiments or his 
movies?” Peruge asked. “Does 
he — ah — shoot?” 

“Nothing like that. Doc wouldn’t 
really hurt anybody. But he can be 
mighty rough-mouthed when he 
wants. He’s got important friends, 
too. Pays to be on his good side.” 
That he has, Peruge thought. 
And that could explain the strange 



108 



GALAXY 




behavior of the local law. Kraft’s 
job must be a sinecure. He would be 
careful not to lose that sinecure. 

Peruge said, “Okay. Let’s go see 
if we can find Dr. Hellstrom’s good 
side.” 

“Yes, sir!” 

Kraft got the car moving, made a 
special effort to act casual and un- 
concerned. Hellstrom’s orders had 
been explicit: this was a routine in- 
vestigation into some missing 
persons. All cooperation would be 
extended. 

Peruge admired the farm 
buildings as they approached the 
north fence. The farm had been 
built in a time when materials were 
squandered without any worries 
about the supply. There wasn’t a 
knot in any of the lumber visible on 
this side of the farmhouse or the 
barn, although the wood had that 
dark gray of long weathering and 
probably could have used a coat of 
paint. Peruge wondered idly why 
the farm wasn’t painted. 

Kraft stopped parallel to the 
fence and just clear of the gate, 
said, “We walk from here. Doc 
doesn’t like us bringing our cars up 
to the buildings.” 

“Why’s that?” 

“Something to do with his work, 
1 expect.” 

“The place could use a coat of 
paint,” Peruge said as he got out his 
side of the car. 

Kraft, got out, closed the door on 
his side and spoke across the roof of 
the car. “1 heard tell Doc used some 
kind of wood preservative on his 
buildings. They just look plain 
weathered. Kind of pretty when you 
think about it.” 

“Oh?” Peruge walked to the gate. 



waited for Kraft. “What’s that 
concrete building over there?” He 
pointed to the low structure inside 
the fence to the left of the gate. 

“Might be a pump house. About 
the right size for a big one. Or it 
could be something to do with the 
Doc’s work. I never asked.” Kraft 
watched Peruge carefully. The 
concrete structure housed an emer- 
gency ventilation system that could 
be opened by explosives and was 
linked to standby pumping. Several 
more such installations were scat- 
tered around the area, but the 
others were camouflaged. 

“Is Hellstrom married?” Peruge 
asked. 

Kraft opened the gate before 
answering. “I don’t rightly know.” 
He stood aside to let Peruge enter, 
closed the gate. “Doc has lots of 
pretty gals around here sometimes. 
For his movies, I s’pose. Maybe he 
thinks there’s no sense buying a 
cow when milk’s free.” Kraft 
chuckled at his own hairy witticism, 
added: “Let’s get along up to the 
farm.” 

F |ERUGE shuddered as he fell 
into step with the deputy. That 
humor had been a little heavy. This 
deputy was neither pure western, 
pure yokel or pure anything else. 
Kraft tried too hard to appear the 
semi-rustic. The trying was so ob- 
vious at times that it dominated 
every other action. Peruge had de- 
cided earlier to watch the deputy 
carefully — now he put an extra note 
of caution on his resolve. 

“Place looks kind of shabby,” 
Peruge said, hurrying to keep pace 
with Kraft’s long-legged stride. De- 
spite the stiffness of his gait, the 



PROJECT 40 



109 




deputy moved with a no-loitering 
directness that suggested he didn’t 
want Peruge to take too close a 
look at the surroundings. 

“I thought it looked pretty good 
here,” Kraft said. “They keep the 
farm area pretty neat.” 

“Do they do much farming?” 

“Not much any more. His folks 
used to keep a lot more crops. 
Some of the kids the Doc has here 
plant corn and things in the spring, 
but they’re just playing at farming, 
seems to me. City people, most of 
them. They come up here from 
Hollywood or out from New York 
and gawk at us natives and play 
farmer.” 

“Hellstrom has a lot of visitors?” 
Peruge kicked at a dusty clump of 
grass as he spoke. The dry, hot air 
of the place bothered him. There 
was an irritant humming sound in 
the background; it was apparently 
coming from the farm, and an un- 
derlying animal smell that made 
him think of a zoo. The odor had 
not been apparent outside the fence, 
but became stronger the deeper 
they went into the little valley. 
What he could see of the creek on 
his right showed only a thin trickle 
of water. The rest was mostly pools 
and puddles connected by narrow 
rills full of green algae that waved 
in weak currents. There appeared 
to be a small waterfall at the upper 
end of the valley, however. 

“Visitors?” Kraft asked after a 
long pause. “Sometimes the place 
is crawling with ’em. Can’t spit 
without hitting someone. Other 
times he probably doesn’t have 
more’n ten or twelve people here.” 

“What’s that smell?” Peruge de- 
manded. 



“What smell?” Kraft asked, then 
realized Peruge meant the Hive 
odor, most of which was washed 
from the vented air, but which was 
always detectable here in the valley. 
Kraft rather enjoyed the odor. It 
reminded him of his childhood. 

“That animal smell,” Peruge 
said. 

“Oh, that. Probably something to 
do with the Doc’s work. He keeps 
mice and things in cages up there. I 
saw them once. Regular me- 
nagerie.” 

“Oh. Is that a year-round water- 
fall I see at the upper end of the 
valley?” 

“Yep. It’s pretty, isn’t it?” 

“If you like that sort of thing. 
What happens to all of the water? 
The creek seems rather small down 
here.” Peruge stopped as Kraft 
looked directly at him, forcing the 
deputy to come to a halt, also. 

“I expect the ground soaks it 
up,” Kraft said. He appeared im- 
patient to continue, but unable to 
think of a good argument. “The 
Doc may take part of it up there for 
irrigation or cooling or something. 
I dunno. Let’s get on up, eh?” 

“Just a minute,” Peruge said. “I 
thought you said Hellstrom didn’t 
do much farming.” 

“Doesn’t. But what he does still 
takes some water. Why you so cu- 
rious about his creek?” 

“I’m curious about everything on 
this place,” Peruge said. “There’s 
something wrong about it. No 
insects. I don’t even see any birds.” 



K raft made a swallowing 
motion in a dry throat. Ob- 
viously, there had been a thorough 



no 



GALAXY 




iiightsweep recently. Trust this Pe- 
ruge to notice the absence of local 
launa! 

“Birds often hide wher.e it’s cool 
m ihe hot part of the day,” he ven- 
lured. 

“Is that right?” 

“Didn’t your birdwatching friend 
ever tell you that?” 

“No.” Peruge glanced around 
liirn, peering carefully at everything 
in sight. The quick and intense mo- 
tions of his head and eyes alarmed 
Kraft. “What he did say once,” Pe- 
I uge continued, “was that there was 
an animal or a bird for every time 
of day or night. I don’t believe the 
birds are hiding — you can’t hear 
them. There are no birds here and 
no insects.” 

“Then what was your friend 
doing here?” Kraft asked. “If there 
are no birds, what was he 
watching?” 

Ah, my friend, not so fast, Peruge 
thought. We aren’t ready yet to 
take off the gloves. But Peruge was 
convinced now that Kraft was in 
league with Hellstrom. Peruge said: 
“C'arlos would’ve noticed the 
absence of birds and he might’ve 
gone hunting for an explanation. If 
lie found an explanation that could 
cause trouble for someone, that 
might explain why he’s missing.” 

“You sure got a suspicious 
mind,” Kraft said. 

“Haven’t you?” Peruge asked. 
I le moved into willow shadows at a 
bend in the creek, forced Kraft to 
lollow. “What’s this Hellstrom 
really like. Deputy?” 

Kraft didn’t care for being called 
Deputy in that tone of voice, but he 
kept his manner casual in response. 
“Oh, he’s just a plain, ordinary. 



run-of-the mill scientist type.” 

Peruge noted that Kraft’s voice 
came out flat and reasonable, but 
something in the set of his body, es- 
pecially in the watchful turn of head 
and eyes, put the lie to this mask. 
Peruge nodded, as though he under- 
stood this, silently urging Kraft to 
continue. 

“They’re all crazy, of course,” 
Kraft said, “but not dangerous.” 

“I’ve never really agreed with 
that harmless, crazy scientist pic- 
ture,” Peruge said. “I don’t think 
they’re all innocent and harmless. 
To me no atomic physicist is 
completely responsible and trust- 
worthy.” 

“Oh, come now, Mr. Peruge.” 
Kraft was making a valiant attempt 
to sound jovial and hearty. “The 
Doc makes movies about bugs. 
Educational. I expect the worst 
thing he’s ever done is bring some 
pretty girls up here for some moon- 
light nooky.” 

“Not even dope?” Peruge 
pressed. 

“You believe all that stuff you 
read about Hollywood types?” 
Kraft asked. 

“Some of it.” 

“I’d bet my bottom dollar that 
the Doc is clean,” Kraft said. 

“Would you?” Peruge asked. 
“How many missing-persons cases 
have you really had in his area over, 
say, the past twenty-five years?” 

With a sinking feeling Kraft 
thought. He’s seen all of the old 
records! Nils had been right about 
this one without even seeing him. 
The Outsiders had sent a sharp and 
prying mind this time. Peruge was 
aware of all the old mistakes the 
Hive had made. Bad. bad. bad. To 



PROJECT 40 



111 




hide his reaction, Kraft turned 
away and resumed his progress 
toward the farm buildings, which 
now were less than fifty yards 
ahead. “Depends on what you call a 
missing person,” he said. And, as 
he noted that Peruge still stood in 
the willow shadow: “Come on. We 
can’t keep the Doc waiting.” 

Peruge followed, suppressing a 
smile. The deputy really was quite 
transparent. Kraft had been shaken 
by the barb about missing persons. 
This was not just a plain, ordinary, 
run-of-the-mill deputy. Things were 
beginning to jell in Peruge’s mind. 
Three agents had been wasted here, 
chasing a suspicion. Discovery of a 
deputy-who-wasn’t-a-deputy gave 
those suspicions a new dimension. 
Something had been learned, after 
all. And, Peruge thought, Hell- 
strom’s learned what we’re willing 
to pay for access to his Project 
40. Now we find out what he’s 
willing to pay. 

“I always thought a missing 
person was a missing person,” Pe- 
ruge said, addressing Kraft’s 
blocky back. 

Kraft spoke without turning: 
“That all depends. Some people 
want to be missing. Guy runs out on 
his wife or his job — I guess he’s 
technically missing. But that’s not 
what you’re saying about your 
man. When I say ‘missing person’ I 
generally mean someone who’s in 
real trouble.” 

“And you don’t think any real 
trouble could happen here?” 

“This isn’t the Old West any 
more,” Kraft said. “This area is 
tamer than a lot of your cities. 
People don’t even lock their doors 
most places around here. Too 



damn much trouble fishing around 
for the keys.” He grinned back over 
his shoulder. “Besides, we wear our 
pants kind of tight. Don’t leave 
much room in our pockets.” 

T hey were passing the farm- 
house now. The barn loomed 
before them across a bare stretch of 
dirt perhaps sixty feet wide. An old 
fence divided the open area, but 
only the posts remained. The wire 
had been removed. There were 
yellowed curtains on the bay 
window of the farmhouse wing that 
jutted toward the creek, but the 
place held an oddly vacant air. 
Kraft wondered about that house. 
Empty? Why? Houses were sup- 
posed to be occupied. Did 
Hellstrom and his crew live there? 
Did they eat there? Why wasn’t 
someone inside rattling pots and 
pans and things? He recalled 
Porter’s comment about negative 
signs. A penetrating observation. 
The wrongness wasn’t so much in 
what you could see around 
Hellstrom’s farm as in what you 
couldn’t see. 

He found another positive sign 
now, though — an acid odor. He 
thought first of photo chemicals, 
then rejected that answer. The 
smell was much more penetrating 
and biting. Something to do with 
Hellstrom’s insects, perhaps? 

A swinging door had been set into 
the old sliding door of the barn. The 
smaller door opened as Kraft and 
Peruge approached. Hellstrom 
himself stepped out. Peruge 
recognized the man from the pho- 
tographs in the Agency’s files. 
Hellstrom wore a white turtleneck 
shirt and gray trousers. His feet 



112 



GALAXY 




were tucked into open sandals. His 
rather sparse light hair looked as 
though it had been tangled by a 
wind and then pushed into a sem- 
blance of order by hurried fingers. 

“Hi, Line,” Hellstrom called. 

“Hi there. Doc.” 

Kraft strode up to Hellstrom, 
shook hands. Peruge, following 
closely, received the odd impression 
of a rehearsed action. Kraft and 
Hellstrom shook hands with such a 
perfunctory sense of unfamiliarity. 

Peruge moved to one side, 
choosing a position that gave him a 
view of the barn door Hellstrom 
had left standing partly open. 
Nothing was visible except dark- 
ness in the small gap remaining. 

T he action seemed to amuse 
Hellstrom. He grinned as Kraft 
introduced him to Peruge. Peruge 
found Hellstrom’s hand cool, but 
rather dry. There was a sense of 
forced relaxation about the man, 
but no sign of excess perspiration in 
the palm. He had himself well 
under control, then. 

“Are you interested in our 
studio?” Hellstrom asked, indi- 
cating the door and the direction of 
Peruge’s gaze with a nod. 

Peruge thought, Aow, aren’t you 
the cool one! He said, “I’ve never 
seen a movie studio.” 

“Line told me on the phone that 
you were looking for one of your 
employes who might be missing in 
our area,” Hellstrom said. 

“Ah, yes.” Peruge wondered why 
he couldn’t see anything beyond 
that open door. He had seen Holly- 
wood studios and remembered 
a sense of organized confusion — 
bright lights, dollies, cameras. 



people bustling about, then that 
frozen stillness of the moments 
when they were filming. 

“Have you seen anyone nosing 
around here. Doc?” Kraft asked. 

“Nobody but our own people,” 
Hellstrom said. “No strangers, at 
least recently. When did these 
people turn up missing?” 

“About a week ago,” Peruge 
said, returning his attention to 
Hellstrom. 

“That recently?” Hellstrom 
asked. “My. Are you sure they 
aren’t just extending their vacation 
without notice?” 

“I’m just as sure as a man can 
be,” Peruge said. 

“You’re welcome to look 
around,” Hellstrom said. “We’ve 
been pretty busy in the studio 
lately, but we would have noticed 
any strangers in the neighborhood. 
We keep a pretty close watch to see 
that no one bursts in on our work 
unexpectedly. I don’t think you’re 
going to find any sign of your 
people in our area.” 

Kraft visibly relaxed, thinking. If 
Nils thinks they’ve cleaned up the 
area well enough, then it’s clean. 

“Oh?” Peruge pursed his lips. It 
came to him abruptly that there 
were several levels to this con- 
versation. He and Hellstrom knew 
this. Most likely the deputy did, 
too. The various parts of the inter- 
leaved message were distinct. Pe- 
ruge was welcome to pry around, 
but he would find nothing incri- 
minating. No strangers could come 
upon Hellstrom’s farm without 
being seen. Hellstrom probably re- 
mained confident that his powerful 
connections would keep the real 
contest submerged. Peruge, for his 



PROJECT 40 



113 




own part, had revealed to 
Hellstrom an awareness that people 
were missing in the immediate 
vicinity of the farm. In a way, 
Hellstrom had not denied this, but 
had merely pointed out that it 
would be useless to look for the 
missing people. How, then, were 
the real stakes to be introduced into 
the game? 

Hellstrom said, “Deputy Kraft 
tells me you work for some kind of 
a fireworks company.” 

Ah, Peruge thought with delight. 
He said, “My firm has diversified 
interests, Mr. Hellstrom. We’re 
also interested in metallurgy, espe- 
cially new processes for ex- 
ploitation. We’re always on the 
hunt for potentially valuable inven- 
tions.” 

Hellstrom stared at him for a 
moment. Then: “Would you like to 
come in and see the studio? We’re 
very busy right now — behind 
schedule on our latest epic.” He 
started to turn, hesitated as though 
at an afterthought. “Oh, I hope 
you’re not carring a radio or 
anything of that kind. We use 
short-range radio in part of our 
mixing circuitry for the 
soundtracks. Other equipment can 
play hob with our work.” 

You son-of-a-bitch! Peruge 
thought. He folded his hands ca- 
sually in front of him, left wrist in 
right palm, turned off the tiny 
wristwatch transmitter. And he 
thought. If you think you re going 
to keep me out of your little 
playpen, baby, you think again. I’m 
going in there and I may see more 
than you expect. 

Hellstrom, noting the movement 
of Peruge’s hands, and suspecting 



the reason, still found himself 
wondering at the man’s curious 
statement about diversified in- 
terests, metallurgy and new in- 
ventions. What could these have to 
do with Project 40? 

XV 

The words of Trova Hell- 
trom: Whatever we do in 
breeding for the specialists we 
require, we must always include 
the human being in our pro- 
cesses, prefering this to the 
intrusion of surgical instru- 
ments. The sexual stump can 
be condoned only as long as 
we include the body’s original 
genetic materials in the prac- 
tice. Anything that smacks of 
genetic surgery or engineering 
must be looked upon with the 
gravest misgivings. We are, 
first and foremost, human 
beings and must never loose 
ourselves from our animal 
ancestry. Whatever we are, we 
are not gods. And whatever this 
universe may be, it obviously 
rests heavily in dependence 
upon the accidental. 

<< TTE’S not transmitting,” 
XA Janvert said, moving the 
control dials on his instruments. He 
sat in the curtained shadows of the 
van’s interior, the receiver mounted 
in front of him on a ledge originally 
intended as part of the camper’s 
kitchen. Nick Myerlie’s bluff and 
sweaty body was leaning over him, 
one red-knuckled hand on the 
counter beside the radio. The big 
man’s heavy features carried a 
frown of deep concern. 



114 



GALAXY 




“What do you think’s happened 
to him?’’ 

“I think he turned his transmitter 
off deliberately.” 

“For god’s sake! Why?” 

“The last thing I received — ” he 
lapped the tape recorder over the 
radio — ” was Hellstrom saying 
something about not bringing any 
radio equipment into their studio.” 
“That’s risky business — turning 
off his transmitter.” 

“I would have done the same,” 
.lanvert said. “He has to get into 
that studio.” 

“But still—” 

“Oh, shut up! Is Clovis still out- 
side with her telescope?” 

“Yes.” Myerlie sounded hurt. He 
knew Jan vert was second in com- 
mand on this case, but it was irri- 
tating to take such short-tempered 
treatment from a runt. 

“See if she’s seen anything.” 
“That thing’s only twenty-power 
and it’s still pretty misty out there. 
Hot weather always does that.” 

“Go find out anyway. Tell her 
what’s happened.” 

“Right.” 

The camper creaked and moved 
as Myerlie took his big body out- 
side. 

Janvert, who had lifted one 
earphone away from his right ear to 
talk to Myerlie, replaced it now and 
stared at the receiver. What had Pe- 
ruge meant by the last odd con- 
versation? Metallurgy? New inven- 
tions? 

The words of Trova 
Hellstrom: Our future lies in an 
ultimate form of human do- 
mestication. All Outside pat- 
terns of humankind must be 



seen, then, as wild forms. In 
our domestication process we 
will necessarily introduce a 
multiplicity of diverse human 
types into our social scheme. 
No matter how much diversity 
this brings, the mutual interde- 
pendence and consequent sense 
of respect for our essential 
oneness must never be lost. 
Brood Mother and Prime Male 
are different only in surface 
features from the lowliest 
worker. If the most exalted 
among us have any prayer, it 
must be one of thanksgiving 
that there are workers. It is 
salutary when seeing a com- 
mon worker, to think: There, 
but for leader foods and 
training, am I. 

E ntering the studio through 

a double-door system — which 
explained why he had not been able 
to see inside the building from the 
yard — Peruge sensed something 
odd about the sounds and move- 
ments. That fetid animal smell was 
very strong in here, too. He as- 
cribed it to a glass-fronted structure 
off on his left, behind which he 
could discern animals in cages. He 
identified mice, guinea pigs and 
monkeys. 

In all of the film studios Peruge 
had seen before this, he had ob- 
served that special quality of silence 
while group energies flowed up a 
mysterious channel into the camera 
lens. This place was different, 
though. No one tiptoed. Those who 
moved about walked with a casual 
silence that suggested they found it 
normal. The door baffles had 
eliminated that incessant humming 



PROJECT 40 



115 




so irritatingly noticeable outside, 
but here a faint sussuration re- 
placed it. 

Only one camera crew appeared 
to be working. It had set up in a 
corner to Peruge’s right and was 
working very close to a glass 
container about three feet on a side. 
The glass reflected hot shards of 
light. 

Hellstrom had warned Peruge 
not to talk until told it was permit- 
ted. Peruge pointed to the camera 
crew in the corner, lifted his eye- 
brows in a silent question. 

Bending close, Hellstrom whis- 
pered, “We’re capturing the articu- 
lation of insect body parts in a new 
way. Magnified views. The lens is 
actually inside that glass 
case — which maintains a special cli- 
mate for the subject insect.” 

Peruge nodded, wondered at the 
rule of silence. Would they be doing 
sound-on-film for such a sequence? 
It seemed unlikely, but his ac- 
quaintance with film making was 
perfunctory at best, hurriedly aug- 
mented for this assignment, and he 
knew better than to speak his 
question aloud. Hellstrom would 
like nothing better than an excuse 
to throw him out. The man’s 
nervousness had become in- 
creasingly obvious. 

Hellstrom leading and Kraft 
bringing up the rear, they struck 
out diagonally across the center of 
the studio area. As always when an 
Outsider was this close to the 
workings of the Hive-head, 
Hellstrom found himself unable to 
completely suppress feelings of dis- 
quiet. The Hive’s territorial condi- 
tioning went too deep. And this Pe- 
ruge reeked of Outsider smells. He 



did not belong in this place. Kraft, 
behind him, would be having an 
even worse time of it. He had never 
before accompanied an Outsider 
into these precincts. The working 
crews were behaving with outward 
normalcy, however. They would 
feel this Outsider’s presence as a 
constant rasping on the awareness, 
but front training dominated their 
reactions. All proceeded smoothly. 

Peruge noticed the movement of 
people around him — across his 
path, beside him, off in the corners 
of the cavernous studio. All ap- 
peared to be on normal business 
and none gave more than a casual 
glance to the trio crossing the open 
area, but Peruge could not avoid 
the feeling that he was under the 
closest scrutiny. He looked upward. 
The bright lights being used in the 
lower part of the studio left the up- 
per regions in deep shadows which 
his vision could not penetrate. Was 
that deliberate? Were they hiding 
something up above him? 

The swinging descent of a cage on 
the end of a boom caught his at- 
tention and he stumbled over a coil 
of cables. He would have fallen if 
Kraft had not leaped forward to 
catch his arm. The deputy restored 
Peruge to balance, put a finger to 
lips for silence. Kraft released Pe- 
ruge’s arm reluctantly. It felt more 
secure to have a controlling arm on 
this intruder. He found himself torn 
by tormenting worries. Nils was 
playing with fire! There were 
voiceless workers out there on the 
studio floor. They had been condi- 
tioned for the menial tasks here, 
but their presence posed an explo- 
sive danger. What if one of them 
reacted to Peruge’s Outsider che- 



116 



GALAXY 




mistry? The man’s smell was of- 
fensive! 

P ^ERUGE, seeing his path clear 
for a few paces, glanced back at 
the descending boom cage. It had 
swung from the gloomy mystery of 
the upper reaches and was moving 
in oiled silence down to the camera 
setup in the corner. A woman in a 
white smock occupied the cage. She 
had a startlingly pale skin accented 
by ebony hair tied at the neck in a 
simple chignon. The fluttering of 
her smock in the wind of the 
boom’s movement suggested that 
she wore nothing under it. 

Kraft pushed Peruge’s arm, 
urging him to move faster. 
Reluctantly Peruge picked up his 
pace. There had been something 
magnetically attractive about that 
pale-skinned woman and he could 
not get her image out of his mind. 
Her face had been a madonna oval 
beneath that black cap of hair. The 
arms protruding from the smock’s 
short sleeves had suggested 
sensuous softness. 

Hellstrom stood now at a door in 
a structure that had been erected as 
a separate, flat-roofed building in- 
side the studio. A wall climbed to 
the upper areas behind the flat roof. 
Peruge estimated that the wall split 
the barn in half lengthwise and 
wondered what lay behind it. He 
followed Hellstrom into a dimly 
lighted room with heavy glass from 
waist height to ceiling across two of 
the inner walls. One glass partition 
gave a view into a smaller studio 
where insects were flitting openly 
back and forth through blue 
light — pale, big-winged moths by 
their appearance. The other 



window framed a shadowy room 
where men and women worked at a 
long, curved bank of electronic 
instruments. Small screens directly 
in front of each operator showed 
lilliputian movements. It reminded 
Peruge of a television control 
booth. 

Kraft closed the door behind the 
trio and stood, arms folded across 
his breast, as though guarding the 
entrance. Another door in the far 
right corner, Peruge noted, led into 
the shadowy room of the electronic 
instruments. Again Peruge felt that 
the entire setup did not quite fit his 
picture of a movie studio. 

A small oblong wooden table 
with four chairs around it stood in 
the room and Hellstrom took a 
chair on the far side of it, spoke in a 
calm voice: “The men you’re 

watching in there, Mr. Peruge, are 
mixing several sound sources for a 
combined track. It’s delicate work.” 

Peruge studied the people in the 
shadowy room, unable to pinpoint 
what struck him as odd about them. 
Abruptly he realized that of the six 
men at the arc of instruments and 
three women standing on the far 
side of the arc, all but one looked 
enough alike to be from the same 
family. Again he scanned the faces 
illuminated by the low, wavering 
light. Five of the men and three of 
the women were alike, not only in 
the uniform white smocks, but in 
short blond hair and rather pinched 
faces, dominated by large eyes. The 
women were distinguished only by 
rather obvious breasts and a slight 
softening of the features. The lone 
male who differed from the others 
was also blond and reminded Pe- 
ruge of someone. He realized then 



PROJECT 40 



117 




that the odd man out looked like 
Hellstrom. 

AS ALL this flashed through his 
xV. mind the door behind Kraft 
opened and the young woman from 
the boom entered. At least, Peruge 
cautioned himself, she appeared to 
be the same young woman, but 
after the people next door he began 
to wonder. 

“Fancy!” Hellstrom exclaimed, 
in quick though quiet alarm. Why 
was she here? He hadn’t sent for her 
and he didn’t like the stalking feline 
expression on her face. 

Kraft stepped aside grudgingly to 
allow her to pass. 

Peruge watched her, noting the 
oval, almost doll-like face, the ex- 
tremely sexy body, its contours 
showing through the thin smock. 
She kept her attention on 
Hellstrom while speaking, but there 
was no doubt she was playing to Pe- 
ruge. 

“Ed sent me over,” she said. “He 
wants you to know that we have to 
re-shoot that mosquito sequence. 
You’re in it, you know. 1 told you 
we’d have to re-shoot. The mos- 
quitoes were disturbed, but you 
wouldn’t listen to me.” 

Abruptly she appeared to notice 
Peruge. She moved to within a pace 
of him and asked, “Who’s this?” 

“This is Mr. Peruge,” Hellstrom 
said, a deep note of caution in his 
voice. What was Fancy doing? 

“Hello, Mr. Peruge,” she said, 
her voice lilting. She moved even 
closer to him. “I’m Fancy.” 

Hellstrom watched her closely. 
What was she doing? He inhaled 
deeply, detected that Fancy had 
shot herself up with breeding- 



hypers. She was trying to arouse 
Peruge! Why? She was having an 
effect, too. Peruge was attracted to 
Fancy and unable to explain the 
sudden magnetism. No wild Out- 
sider could understand the simple 
chemistry of the situation. Kraft, 
too, was caught momentarily by 
her powerful sexuality, but 
Hellstrom flashed a hand signal 
that alerted him to the hypers. 
Kraft, long out of the Hive’s daily 
contacts and constant reinforce- 
ments, took a few seconds to re- 
cover. Peruge, however, was not re- 
covering. 

Should he let this continue? 
Hellstrom wondered. She was 
playing a dangerous game and 
acting without instructions. 
Granted, it would be desirable to 
have Peruge’s genes in the Hive 
stocks, but . 

Peruge stood in partial shock. He 
could not recall having been caught 
up in sexual excitement this swiftly 
and this thoroughly ever before. 
The woman felt it, too. She was 
panting for him. He wondered dis- 
tantly if these people had done 
something to him, but rejected the 
consideration immediately. This 
was that oddly random chemistry 
one heard about. He realized, 
catching up with her words, that 
Fancy was asking if he were going 
to stay the night. 

With an effort Peruge said, “I’m 
staying in town.” 

She glanced at Hellstrom. “Nils, 
why don’t you invite Mr. Peruge to 
stay with us?” 

“Mr. Peruge is here on business,” 
Hellstrom said. “I imagine he 
would prefer staying in his own 
quarters.” 



118 



GALAXY 




Peruge wanted nothing more 
than to stay the night with this com- 
pelling woman, but he began to 
sense inner alarm signals. 

“You’re just being stuffy,” Fancy 
said to Hellstrom, Again she 
looked up into Peruge’s eyes. “Are 
you in films, Mr. Peruge?” 

He tried to fight free of that en- 
veloping aura of sexuality, tried to 
think. “No. I’m — I’m, ah, looking 
for some friends, an employee and 
his wife, who are missing. They 
were last reported around here 
someplace.” 

“Oh, I hope nothing’s happened 
to them,” she said. 

Hellstrom arose from the table, 
crossed to Peruge’s side. “Fancy, 
we do have a schedule to keep.” 



F ^ERUGE tried to wet his lips 
with his tongue. His mouth felt 
dry. His body trembled. The delec- 
table little witch! fVas she told to 
make a play for me? 

Hellstrom glanced at Kraft, won- 
dered if he should do something 
physical to get Fancy out of the 
room. She had really shot herself 
up, the crazy female! He spoke to 
her in a reasonable but com- 
manding tone: “Fancy, you’d better 
get back to the crew. Tell Saldo I 
want special attention paid to the 
most urgent problems first and tell 
Ed I’ll be ready to re-shoot the 
mosquito sequence tonight.” 

Fancy drew back a step, relaxed. 
She had this Peruge on a string and 
she knew it. The man almost 
followed her as she moved away 
from him. He would keep. She said, 
“All you ever think about is work. 
Anybody would think you were just 



a plain old, common everyday 
worker.” 

She was taunting him, Hellstrom 
realized. 

Fancy obeyed him, though, her 
Hive-training dominant. She 
turned slowly, walked to the door 
with only a flicking glance at Kraft. 
She paused in the doorway to look 
back at Peruge. She smiled at the 
Outsider then, slyly and invitingly, 
raised her eyebrows in another 
silent taunt directed at Hellstrom 
and went out, closing the door 
softly behind her. 

Peruge cleared his throat. 

Hellstrom studied Peruge. The 
man was having trouble recovering, 
not surprising in view of how Fancy 
had armed herself for that attack. 
It had been an attack, Hellstrom 
realized. Pure attack. She was out 
to get Peruge, to breed him. 

“That’s a — very attractive 
woman,” Peruge said, his voice 
husky. 

“Would you like to go over to the 
house for a cup of coffee?” 
Hellstrom asked, feeling a sudden 
sympathy for Peruge. The poor 
wild creature had no idea of what 
had happened to him. 

“That’s very kind of you,” Pe- 
ruge said, “but I thought we were 
going to look at your studio.” 

“Didn’t you see the studio out 
there?” 

“Is that all there is to it?” 

“Oh, we have the usual support 
facilities,” Hellstrom said. “Some 
of it’s too technical for the casual 
visitor to understand, but we have a 
wardrobe section and one of the 
best editing labs in the business. 
Our collection of rare insects is 
without equal anywhere in the 



PROJECT 40 



119 




world. We could also screen some 
of our film for you if you’d like, just 
to show you what we do here, but 
not today. I’m afraid. The schedule 
is pretty tight. I hope you under- 
stand.” 

Kraft took up his cue. “Are we 
delaying you. Doc? I know how im- 
portant your work is. We just came 
by to find out if any of your folks 
had seen any of Mr. Peruge’s 
friends.” 

“I’ll certainly inquire around 
among my crew about that,” 
Hellstrom said. “Why don’t you 
come back and take lunch with us 
tomorrow, Mr. Peruge? Maybe I’ll 
have something to report by then.” 

“I’d like to do that,” Peruge said. 
“What time?” 

“Would eleven in the morning be 
all right?” 

“That would be fine. Maybe 
some of your people would like to 
hear about my company then, too. 
We do have an intense interest in 
metallurgy and new inventions.” 

There he goes again, Hellstrom 
thought. He said, “If you get here 
by eleven we’ll have about an hour 
before lunch. I’ll have someone 
show you around — editing, ward- 
robe, the insects.” He smiled 
pleasantly. 

Will my guide be Fancy? Peruge 
wondered, feeling his heartbeat 
quicken. 

He said, “I’ll be looking forward 
to that. In the meantime — I hope 
you won’t mind if I call in some 
help and have a look around the 
area myself.” 

Hellstrom saw Kraft’s muscles 
tighten, spoke quickly, “Not right 
here on the farm, I hope, Mr. Pe- 
ruge. We’re getting ready to shoot 



some outside footage while this 
weather holds. It doesn’t help much 
when people stumble over our 
setups and delay us. I hope you 
understand how costly such delays 
can be.” 

“Oh, yes, I understand,” Peruge 
said. “I was thinking only of having 
a look at some of the range area 
around your farm. Carlos’s letter 
made it clear that he was in this 
area. I thought we might see if we 
could turn up something.” 

Aware of Hellstrom’s mounting 
alarm, Kraft said, “We don’t want 
you interfering with the official in- 
vestigation, Mr. Peruge. Amateurs 
can completely destroy evidence 
without — ” 

“Oh, I’ll have only the best 
professional help,” Peruge said. 
“You can count on that. They 
won’t interfere one bit with the of- 
ficial investigation. And I’ll make 
sure they don’t bother Mr. 
Hellstrom at his movie-making. 
You’ll have nothing but admiration 
for the quality of professional help 
I’m calling in, Mr. Kraft.” 

“Guess you don’t care how much 
money you spend searching for 
your people,” Kraft muttered. 

“Expense is no object,” Peruge 
agreed. He was enjoying this sud- 
denly. This pair was on the hook. 
They knew it, too. “We’re going to 
find out what happened to our 
people.” 

That challenge is plain enough. 
Hellstrom thought. He said, “Of 
course, we sympathize with your 
concern. Our own immediate prob- 
lems tend to dominate our at- 
tention. We can be pretty single- 
minded when our schedule is 
threatened.” 



120

F ^ERUGE felt himself beginning 
to come down from the lift 
Fancy had given him and now 
alarm and anger began to take 
over. They had tried to catch him 
with a little pussy! He said, “I 
understand how things are, 
Hellstrom. I’m going to tell my 
home office to deploy all the 
professional manpower we can 
spare.” 

Kraft stared at Hellstrom, 
seeking a cue. 

Hellstrom said evenly, “We 
understand each other, 1 think, Pe- 
ruge.” He glanced at Kraft. “You 
just keep intruders from interfering 
with us, eh. Line?” 

Kraft nodded. What did Nils 
mean? How could he stop an army 
of investigators? This Peruge was 
going to call in the FBI. The bas- 
tard had done everything but say it 
in so many words! 

“Until tomorrow, then,” Peruge 
said. 

“Line knows the way out,” 
Hellstrom said. “I hope you will 
forgive me if I don’t see you out. I 
really must stay and get on with my 
work.” 

“Of course,” Peruge said. “I’ve 
already noticed how well Deputy 
Kraft knows his way around your 
farm.” 

Hellstrom’s eyes glittered as he 
shot a restraining signal at Kraft. 
“Local officials have never been 
barred from our land,” Hellstrom 
said. “We will see you tomorrow, 
Peruge.” 

“You certainly will.” 

Peruge moved ahead of Kraft to 
the door, opened it and stepped out 
into a full collision with Fancy, who 
appeared to be returning. He 



caught an arm around her to keep 
her from falling. There was no 
doubt at all that she wore nothing 
under the white smock. She ground 
into him as he jerked his arm away 
in shock. 

Kraft pulled her away, asked, 
“You all right. Fancy?” 

“I’m fine,” she said, grinning at 
Peruge. 

“That was clumsy of me,” Pe- 
ruge said. “I’m sorry.” 

“You needn’t be,” she said. 
Hellstrom spoke from behind 
them. “We’ve had enough commo- 
tion out here. Line. Would you see 
Mr. Peruge out?” 

They left hurriedly, Peruge in 
considerable confusion. He’d 
received the unmistakable im- 
pression that Fancy had been ready 
to flop him down and seduce him 
right then and there! 

Hellstrom waited until the outer 
door closed behind Kraft and Pe- 
ruge, then turned an inquiring stare 
on Fancy. 

“He’s in the bag,” she said. 
“Fancy, what are you doing?” 
“I’m doing my homework.” 
Hellstrom suddenly noted the 
thickening of Fancy’s bosom, the 
way her upper arms stretched the 
fabric of the smock. 

He asked, “Fancy, do you see 
yourself as a broodmother?” 

“We haven’t had one since 
Trova,” she said. 

“And you know why.” 

“All that nonsense about a 
broodmother exciting the swarming 
drive?” 

“It’s not nonsense and you know 
it.” 

“Some of us think it is. We think 
the Hive may swarm without a 



PROJECT 40 



121 




broodm other, and that might be 
disastrous.” 

“Fancy, don’t you think we know 
our jobs? The Hive will have to 
grow at least ten thousand more 
workers before swarming pressures 
become apparent.” 

“They’re apparent right now,” 
she said. She rubbed her arms. 
“Some of us can feel them.”

Comment on the current film: 
The film sequence shows an 
insect cell, the development of 
the egg and, finally, the cater- 
pillar emerging. How striking 
is this metaphor. We emerge 
from the parent body, those 
wild creatures who call them- 
selves humankind. The mes- 
sage of this metaphor goes 
much deeper, however. It says 
we must prepare for our 
emergence. We are immature 
at this stage, our needs dom- 
inated by preparations for 
adulthood. When we emerge, 
it will be to take dominion 
over the surface of the Earth. 
When we have achieved our 
adult form we will eat to live 
rather than to grow. 

F ^ERUGE heard the telephone 
ring for a long time before the 
Chief answered. He had been sit- 
ting on the edge of his motel bed 
after returning from lunch with 
Hellstrom. It had been an ex- 
tremely disappointing lunch. He 
had seen no sign of Fancy. The 
proceedings in the dining room of 
the old farmhouse had been formal 
and shallow. No one had risen to 



his bait about new inventions. The 
Chief was not going to like this 
report. 

The Chiefs voice came on the 
phone presently, alert and respon- 
sive despite the long delay in 
answering. The old man had not 
been asleep, then, but doing some- 
thing he had refused to interrupt 
even to answer what he often re- 
ferred to as “that instrument from 
hell.” 

“I told you I’d call as soon as I 
got back,” Peruge said. 

“Where are you calling from?” 
“The motel. Why?” 

“Are you sure that phone’s 
clean?” 

“It’s clean. I checked.” 

“Let’s scramble anyway.” 

Peruge sighed, got out his equip- 
ment. Presently he had the Chief’s 
voice in his ear with that distant 
quality the scrambler imposed. 

“Now tell me what you found 
out.” 

“They refuse to respond to any 
overture about metallurgy or new 
inventions.” 

“Did you quote an offer?” 

“I said I knew someone who 
would pay up to a million for a 
promising invention in that field.” 
“That didn’t tip them?” 
“Nothing.” 

“The board is beginning to 
pressure me,” the Chief said. 
“We’re going to have to act soon, 
one way or another.” 

“Hellstrom must have some 
price,” Peruge said. 

“You think he may bite, if you up 
the ante?” 

“I don’t know for sure. What I’d 
like to do is send Janvert and 
probably Myerlie around to the 



122 



GALAXY 




south of Hellstrom’s valley and 
look for signs of Carlos and 
Tymiena. I have a hunch they may 
have approached • from the 
south — the lower end of that valley. 
Lots of trees that way and you 
know how cautious Carlos was.” 
“You send no one.” 

“Chief, if we— ” 

“No.” 

“But if we could put that kind of 
pressure on Hellstrom, we might 
get him for much less. We could 
have this thing all sewed up and 
ready to move before the board 
gets — well, you know how they can 
be when they get suspicious.” 

“You would teach your grand- 
father to suck eggs? I said no!” 

F JERUGE began to sense com- 
plications. “Then what do you 
want me to do?” 

“Tell me what you saw at 
Hellstrom’s place.” 

“Not much more than I saw 
yesterday.” 

“Be specific.” 

“In one sense, the place is quite 
ordinary. Almost too businesslike. 
No relaxation — everyone seems 
serious and — dedicated. That’s the 
word that kept occurring to me. 
That’s not ordinary. These people 
put me in mind of a Chicom farm 
commune laboring to meet its 
harvest quota.” 

“I don’t think we’re going to find 
a Red in this woodpile,” the other 
said, “but that’s something to keep 
in mind if we need to cover our- 
selves with glory. However, the 
matter is much more serious than 
you realize.” 

“Oh?” Peruge was suddenly 
alert, intensely concentrated on the 



voice coming to him over the 
phone. 

“I had a call from upstairs 
today,” the Chief said. “A special 
assistant to the Man. They wanted 
to know if we were the ones poking 
into Hellstrom’s affairs.” 

“Oh-oh!” That explained why 
Hellstrom had appeared so confi- 
dently in command of the situation. 
How did this little bug doctor get 
that kind of clout? 

“What did you do?” Peruge 
asked. 

“I lied,” the Chief said, his voice 
bland. “I said it must be somebody 
else because I hadn’t heard about it. 
However, I promised to check be- 
cause sometimes my people become 
a bit overzealous.” 

Peruge stared at the wall in 
silence for a moment. Who was 
being set up here? He said, “We 
have Merrivale lined up if we need a 
patsy.” 

“That was one of the things I 
considered.” 

One of the things? 

The Chief interrupted his 
development of that worry by 
asking, “Now tell me what they’re 
doing on that farm.” 

“They’re making movies about 
insects.” 

“You told me that yesterday. Is 
that all they’re doing?” 

“I’m not sure what else — but I 
have some ideas about where they 
may be doing it. There’s a 
basement in that studio — wardrobe 
and some other crap down there, all 
disgustingly standard in ap- 
pearance. But a tunnel leads from 
the barn to the old farmhouse. They 
took me through it and we had 
lunch in the house. There were 



PROJECT 40 



123 




some very strange dames to wait on 
us, too, I tell you. Beautiful dolls, 
all four of them, but they don’t 
talk — not even when you speak 
directly to them.” 

“What?” 

“They don’t speak. They just 
serve table and go away. Hellstrom 
said it’s because they’re perfecting 
special accents and have been or- 
dered by their voice coach not to 
say anything unless the coach is 
there to listen and correct them.” 
“That sounds reasonable.” 

“Does it? It struck me as odd.” 
“Were you transmitting to 
Janvert and the others?” 

“No. It was the same as 
yesterday. They were very nice 
about it and so-o-o reasonable. 
Radio for their soundtracks and so 
on. Would I please not cause prob- 
lems?” 

“I still don’t like you going in 
there without radio. If something — 
Maybe you’d better replace Janvert 
with Myerlie or DT as your 
second.” 

“Relax. Hellstrom as much as 
told me that I’d be all right if I 
played it cool.” 

“How did he do that?” 

“He explained in detail how 
angry he gets when people cause 
setbacks in their schedule. I was 
told to stick close to my guide and 
not stray.” 

“Who was your guide?” 

“Some little guy named 
Saldo — no bigger than Shorty 
Janvert. Very close-mouthed. 
There was no sign of the dame they 
threw at me yesterday.” 

“Dzule, are you sure you’re not 
imagining — ” 

“I’m sure. Look, we’re stymied. I 



need help. I want the highway pa- 
trol, the FBI and anyone else we 
can dragoon into crawling over 
those hills around Hellstrom’s 
farm — ” 

“Dzule! Didn’t you hear me when 
I told you about my call from up- 
stairs?” 

F ^ERUGE tried to swallow in a 
suddenly dry throat. The Chief 
could be abrupt and final when his 
voice took on that calm, reasonable 
tone of correction. So there was 
more than just reported to that call 
from upstairs. The troops were 
stirred up. 

“You cannot ask for help on a 
project that doesn’t exist,” the 
Chief said. 

“Did you know I’d transmitted a 
request through Signals for FBI 
help?” 

“I intercepted that and cut it off. 
That request no longer exists.” 

“Is there any way we could get an 
overflight to inspect that farm?” 
“Why?” 

“It’s what I was starting to ex- 
plain. This tunnel from the barn to 
the house — I’d like to know if there 
are more such tunnels under that 
area. Geological Survey has tech- 
niques to detect that kind of thing.” 
“I don’t think I could ask for that 
kind of help without tipping our 
hand. I’ll look into it, though. 
There may be some other way. 
You’re suggesting they may have 
laboratories and such under the 
barn in tunnels?” 

“Yes.” 

“It’s an idea. I’ve a couple of 
friends in the oil industry who owe 
us favors.” 

“The board—” 



124

“Dzule!” A warning note in the 
voice said: Don’t question my in- 
telligence. 

“I’m sorry. Chief,” Peruge said. 
“It’s just that — well. I’m uneasy 
about this thing; All afternoon at 
that farm — 1 kept wanting to get 
the hell out of there. There’s a stink 
about the place and — it’s a creepy 
setup. The trouble is, I can’t pin 
down a single thing — except the 
blatant facts of Porter and com- 
pany.” 

The voice on the phone took on a 
patronizing, fatherly tone. “Dzule, 
my boy, don’t go inventing trouble. 
If we can’t get our hands on 
Hellstrom’s invention and control 
the metallurgical process this be- 
comes a straightforward case. I can 
discover that some of my 
overzealous boys have uncovered a 
hornet’s nest of subversion. To do 
that, however, we need much more 
than we already possess.” 

“Porter and — ” 

“They don’t exist. You forget 
that my signature was on the 
orders.” 

“Ah — yes, of course.” 

“I can go upstairs and say we 
have this bit of a file — little more 
than a memorandum, really — 
which one of our boys found at the 
MIT Library. I can do that — but 
only if I’m ready to defend the ar- 
gument that it involves the private 
development of a major weapons 
system.” 

“Unless we have more infor- 
mation they’ll make the same kinds 
of guesses we did.” 

“Precisely,” the Chief said. 

“I see. Then you want me to take 
this to an open negotiation with 
Hellstrom.” 



“Indeed I do. Is there any reason 
why you think you cannot do that?” 
“I can attempt it. I have a date to 
go back there tomorrow. I led them 
to believe I’ll have an army of 
professional help to conduct a 
search of the area within a day or so 
and they — ” 

“What are your preparations?” 
“Janvert and his teams will be 
using line-of-sight to follow my 
movements while I’m outside the 
buildings. When I get inside, I most 
likely will be incommunicado. We 
will, of course, probe for a soft 
spot — a window or something that 
could act as a microphone for our 
laser pickup. However, I don’t be- 
lieve I should wait for that kind of 
contact before opening — ” 

“How do you propose to open the 
negotiations?” 




up. I’ll admit that I’m an envoy of a 
powerful agency in the government, 
but I won’t identify us, naturally. 
After that—” 

“No.” 

“But—” 

“We have three agents probably 
dead and they — ” 

“They don’t exist. You said so 
yourself.” 

“Except to us, Dzule. No. You 
will merely tell them that you 
represent people who are interested 
in their Project 40. Let them worry 
about what reserves you may have. 
They’ve probably killed three 
people — that, or they’re holding 
prisoners and — ” 

“Should I look into that possi- 
bility?” 

“For God’s sake! Of course not. 



PROJECT 40

But the chances are high they’ll be 
more fearful of what they suspect 
than of what they know. For all 
they know, you could have the 
army, the navy and the marines 
standing by, with the FBI in 
reserve. If you need leverage, 
mention our missing friends, b^ut 
don’t appear anxious to get them 
back. Refuse to negotiate on that 
score. We want Project Forty, 
nothing else. We don’t want 
murderers or kidnapers or missing 
people. Is that clear?” 

“Very.” And, an empty feeling 
growing within him, Peruge 
thought. What if I turn up missing? 
He thought he knew the answer to 
the question and he didn’t like it. 

“I’ll get those oil people to do 
what they can,” the Chief said, 
“but only if it can be done without 
tipping our hand. Finding out 
where Hellstrom’s people work 
doesn’t strike me as too helpful at 
this point.” 

“What if he refuses to ne- 
gotiate?” Peruge asked. 

“Don’t provoke a showdown on 
it. We still have the board and its 
forces in reserve.” 

“But they’d — ” 

“They’d take the whole thing and 
throw us a bone, yes. But a bone is 
better than nothing.” 

“Project Forty could be entirely 
innocent.” 

“You don’t believe that,” the 
Chief said. “And it’s your job to 
prove what we both know in this 
case.” The Chief cleared his throat, 
a loud, hacking noise over the 
scrambler. “As long as we have no 
proof we don’t have a damn thing. 
They could have the secret of the 
end of the world down there, as we 



led the boafd to believe, but we 
can’t move unless we prove it. How 
many times do I have to say that?” 

Peruge rubbed his left knee where 
he had bumped it against a light 
stand in Hellstrom’s studio. It 
wasn’t like the Chief to continue to 
stress a point. What was happening 
back there? Was the Chief trying to 
send him a subtle message? 

“Do you want me to find a good 
excuse for us to pull out of this?” 
Peruge asked. 

There was open relief in the 
Chiefs voice; “Only if it seems the 
right thing to do, my boy.” 

Somebody's with him, Peruge 
realized. It had to be someone ac- 
corded a degree of trust, somebody 
important, but someone who could 
not be told everything. Try as he 
might, Peruge could not fit anyone 
he knew into this description. It 
should be perfectly obvious to the 
Chief that his agent in the field had 
no intention of pulling out. But he 
was fishing for that suggestion from 
me. Which meant the someone in 
the Chiefs office was hearing both 
ends of the conversation. The 
cryptic nature of the hidden 
message bespoke extreme caution 
at headquarters. A call from up- 
stairs? How powerful a man was 
this Hellstrom? 

“Can you say anything about the 
kinds of toes we may be stepping 
on?” Peruge asked. 

“No.” 

“Isn’t it even possible to find out 
whether Hellstrom’s influence has a 
purely political base — big contribu- 
tions to the party, that sort of 
thing — or whether it’s possible, for 
instance, that we’re nosing into the 
affairs of another agency?” 



126 



GALAXY 




“Now you’re beginning to under- 
stand the problem as I now see it,” 
the Chief said. 

So somebody from' another 
agency is with him now, Peruge 
thought. That could mean one of 
the Chiefs own people had been in- 
filtrated into the other agency. It 
could mean there were two agencies 
interested in Hellstrom or it could 
mean Hellstrom ’s Project 40 was 
the product of another agency. In- 
vestigators could be tripping over 
each other if this thing were stirred 
up enough. 

“I get the message,” Peruge said. 

“When you meet Hellstrom,” the 
Chief said, “don’t introduce this 
other possibility yourself. Leave 
that up to him.” 

“I understand.” 

“I certainly hope you do — for 
your own sake as well as mine.” 

“Shall I call you back later 
today?” 

“Not unless you have something 
new to report. Call me immediately 
after you’ve seen Hellstrom, 
however. I’ll be waiting.” 

Peruge heard the connection 
close at the other end. He discon- 
nected his scrambler, replaced the 
telephone on its stand. For the first 
time in his life, Peruge began to 
sense what his field agents felt. It’s 
all very well for him to sit back 
there all safe and tidy, but I’ve got 
to go out and risk my neck and he 
won’t lift a finger if I get chopped! 

XVII 

The words of Trova Hellstrom: 
At all cost, we must avoid 
falling into what we have come 
to understand as “the termite 



trap.” We must not become too 
much like the termite. Such 
insects give us our pattern for 
survival, but they have their 
ways and we have ours. We 
learn from them, but not 
slavishly. Termites, never able 
to leave the protective walls of 
their mound, come into a world 
that is completely self-suffi- 
cient. And thus it must be with 
us. The entire termite society is 
guarded by soldiers. And thus 
it must be with us. When the 
mound comes under attack the 
soldiers know they can be 
abandoned outside the mound, 
left to die to buy time for others 
to make the mound im- 
pregnable. And thus it must be 
with us. But the mound dies if 
the queen dies. We cannot be 
that vulnerable. If the mound 
dies, that is the end of them. 
We cannot be that vulnerable. 
The small seeds of our con- 
tinuation have been planted 
Outside. They must be pre- 
pared to go on alone if our 
mound dies. 



AS HE returned to the Hive down 
the long slope of the First 
Gallery, Hellstrom listened for 
some sound or other message to 
reassure him that all was well here. 
No such message came to him. The 
Hive remained an entity — it still 
functioned — but the sense of pro- 
found disturbance reached all 
through it. That was the Hive’s 
nature: touch one part of it and all 
its cells responded. The chemistry 
of their internal communication 
could not be denied. Key workers, 
driven by the urgency of their situa- 



PROJECT40 



127 




tion, emitted subtle pheromones, 
external hormones that spread 
through the common air. The 
Hive’s filters had been reduced to a 
minimum to conserve power. The 
pheromone signals remained for all 
to inhale and for all to share. Signs 
indicated that this situation could 
not continue without profound and 
possibly permanent effect on the 
totality. 

His broodmother had once 
warned him: Nils, the Hive can 
learn just as you learn. The totality 
can learn. If you fail to understand 
what the Hive learns you could 
bring about destruction for us all. 

What was the Hive learning now? 
Hellstrom wondered. 

Fancy’s behavior suggested 
something demanded by the Hive in 
its deepest needs. She spoke of 
swarming. Was that it? They had 
been working for more than forty 
years to delay swarming. Had that 
been a mistake? He was worried 
about Fancy and had just tried un- 
successfully to find her. She was 
supposed to be with the shooting 
crew, but she hadn’t been at her 
station and Ed had not known 
where to find her. Saldo had 
assured him that Fancy was now 
under constant surveillance, but 
still Hellstrom worried. Could the 
Hive create a natural broodmother? 
Fancy might be a logical choice for 
this role. What could the Council 
do if that happened? Should they 
send Fancy to the vats rather than 
risk an early swarming? He hated 
the thought of losing Fancy — that 
superb bloodline had produced 
many useful specialists. 

If we could only breed out the in- 
stability. 



Provided the problem was insta- 
bility. 

Hellstrom came to the concrete 
arch that opened into the Second 
Level feeding station, saw that 
Saldo awaited him there as or- 
dered. Saldo could be depended on. 
This reassured Hellstrom. He 
realized how much he had come to 
depend upon the younger male. 
Without speaking, Hellstrom 
moved to Saldo’s side. They 
entered the feeding station and fed 
together at the conveyor, drinking 
deeply of the common broth from 
the vats. Hellstrom always found a 
deep satisfaction in eating the food 
of the common workers. It was a 
satisfaction the supplemental leader 
foods never gave him. The leader 
foods might double the expected 
Hive lifetime, yet they lacked that 
one ingredient Hellstrom identified 
as unifying force. 

Sometimes we need a lowest 
common denominator, he thought. 
This was never more apparent than 
in a time of crisis. 

Saldo signaled that he was 
anxious to report, but Hellstrom 
gave the sign for patience, recog- 
nizing his own unwillingness to hear 
that report. While eating, 
Hellstrom had felt himself over- 
come by realization of how fragile 
the Hive was. The domesticated 
world he sought for humankind 
seemed now no more than a thin- 
shelled egg about to be crushed. All 
was so clear and sturdy in the Hive 
Manual, but so shimmering and 
weak in the execution. Although his 
mind searched for a clue, he could 
see no help in the Manual. 

The Hive moves toward a non- 
verbal base for human existence. It 



128 



GALAXY 




is a major purpose of the Hive to 
find that base, then to build a new 
language fitted to our needs. First, 
in the light of that plain message 
from the insect world, we shed the 
errors of the past. 

They had not shed the errors of 
the past. They might never shed 
them. The path loomed so long, so 
exacting in its demands. No one 
had really imagined how long it 
might take or how many pitfalls 
they might have to surmount. At 
first — three hundred or more years 
ago, back in the oral-tradition 
times — they had assumed “a 
hundred years or so.” How swiftly 
that error of the past had made it- 
self known! The new truth had 
arisen then — the Hive might have 
to endure for a thousand years or 
more, unless a dramatic death con- 
vulsion overcame the Outsiders. A 
thousand years until the Earth lay 
domesticated under their dominion. 

Hellstrom recalled thinking how 
the familiar Hive walls around him 
might crumble and be repaired hun- 
dreds of times before the Hive came 
into its own and the workers took 
over control of the planet surface. 

What a fantasy! These walls 
might endure no more than another 
few hours and never be rebuilt. 



T he necessity of breathing con- 
fidence into the Hive had never 
seemed this difficult. Reluctantly 
Hellstrom signaled for Saldo to 
speak, noting with a sense of revul- 
sion how obvious it was that the 
younger man thought a few words 
with the Prime Male would solve all 
problems. 

“Fancy got the breeding hypers 



from Hive stores by stealing them,” 
Saldo said. “There’s no record of 
an official — ” 

“But why did she take them?” 
Hellstrom asked. 

“To defy you, the Council and 
the Hive,” Saldo said. He obviously 
thought the question demented. 

“We must not be too quick to 
judge,” Hellstrom said. 

“But she’s dangerous! She 
should — ” 

“She must be allowed to continue 
without interference,” Hellstrom 
said. “Perhaps the entire Hive ac- 
tually speaks through her.” 

“Are we trying to breed with this 
Peruge?” 

“Why not? We’ve used that 
method of getting outside blood 
many times. Peruge has been pre- 
selected for us by the wild Outside. 
He is living evidence of success.” 

“Success at what price?” 

“However we get the strong 
ones — you know we must get them. 
Perhaps Fancy knows better than 
any of us how to deal with this 
threat.” 

“I don’t believe it! I think she’s 
using this talk of a swarm as an ex- 
cuse to leave the Hive. You know 
how fond she is of Outsider foods 
and comforts.” 

“There is that possibility,” 
Hellstrom agreed. “But why does 
she want to leave? I think your ex- 
planation is too glib.” 

Saldo appeared more abashed by 
the implied rebuke than it had war- 
ranted. He was silent for a moment. 

Then; “Nils, I don’t understand 
what you’re saying.” 

“I do not understand it clearly 
myself, but Fancy’s behavior may 
not be as simple as you imagine.” 



PROJECT 40 



129 




Saldo stared questioningly at 
Hellstrom’s face as though some 
line or flicker of movement there 
might provide enlightenment. What 
did the Prime Male know that 
others did not? Hellstrom was an 
offspring of the Elders, the first 
colonists of this, the first true Hive. 
Had he received special instructions 
from that mysterious source of 
wisdom — what to do in this kind of 
crisis? Saldo’ s attention was caught 
by a flicker of movement to his 
left — the bowls of broth moving on 
the conveyor — as someone took a 
bowl from the end. Workers were 
feeding around them, taking no 
special notice of the two superior 
specialists. It was natural that no 
special notice be taken — common 
chemistry told the workers who 
belonged here and who did not. 
Bring in an Outsider, though, and 
unless the workers could see that 
the Outsider was under the control 
of their fellows or unless the alien’s 
chemistry had been sufficiently 
masked the intruder would go im- 
mediately into the vats, carried 
there by unspeaking workers who 
cared only that a dangerous mass of 
protein be removed. The workers’ 
response now appeared all very 
normal, but Saldo began to ex- 
perience in this moment some of 
Hellstrom’s sense that the Hive had 
been deeply wounded. There was a 
jerky stiffness to some of the 
movement, a belligerent thrust 
about the stride. 

“Is something wrong of which I 
am unaware?” Saldo asked. 

Ah, the wisdom of this young 
male! Hellstrom thought, pride suf- 
fusing him. 

“That may well be,” Hellstrom 



said. He turned, signaled for Saldo 
to follow, led the way to the gallery. 
They took the first side ramp and 
the next lateral passage, proceeded 
briskly to Hellstrom’s cell. Inside, 
Hellstrom indicated a chair for 
Saldo, but stretched his own body 
on the bed. Blessed brood, but he 
was tired! 

EEDIENTLY Saldo sat 
down, glanced around. He 
had been in this cell before, but 
present circumstances made the 
place appear vaguely strange. A 
disturbing difference clamored for 
his attention, but he could not pin- 
point it. Presently he realized the 
difference was the reduced noise 
from the service tunnel behind the 
rear wall of the cell. The hushed 
minimum of Hive operation could 
not be escaped in this place. 
Perhaps that was why Hellstrom re- 
fused to move to better quarters. 
Subtle odors of disturbance could 
be detected in the air, too. All the 
messages of crisis came to focus 
here. 

“Things are wrong here that none 
of us know about,” Hellstrom said, 
picking up the conversation with an 
answer to the question Saldo had 
asked at the feeding station. “That 
is our problem, Saldo. Events will 
occur to alarm us and we must be 
prepared to deal with them on their 
own terms. As the Outsiders" say: 
‘We must hang loose.’ Do you 
understand?” 

“No.” Saldo shook his head. 
“What kind of events do you 
mean?” 

“If I could describe them, they 
would not fit the definition of un- 
knowns.” Hellstrom’s voice was 




130 



GALAXY 




sad. Moving only his eyes, keeping 
his hands clasped behind his head, 
Hellstrom glanced across at Saldo. 
The young male suddenly- appeared 
as fragile as the Hive. What could 
Saldo’s imaginative resourcefulness 
really do to avert the disaster 
building around him? Saldo was 
only thirty-four years old. Hive 
education gave those years a spe- 
cious sophistication, a false world- 
liness of a kind never seen Outside. 
Saldo’s naivete was Hive naivete. 
He did not know the kinds of lib- 
erties he might exercise Outside. 
He did not know what it was to be 
truly wild. Except vicariously 
through books and all the other 
trappings of Hive education, Saldo 
had little experience of the ran- 
domness that prevailed beyond the 
confines of the Hive. Given time, 
Saldo might gain that experience. 
The young male was the exact type 
the Hive must send into the 
tempering cauldron of wild human- 
kind. But much of what he learned 
from his Outside ventures would 
bring him nightmares. He would, as 
every front specialist did, encyst 
those nightmares in a special un- 
conscious core at the depths of his 
being. 

Just as I have walled up my own 
most trying experiences, Hellstrom 
thought. 

There could be no complete and 
permanent denial of such memories 
short of the vats, though. They 
came stealing out through unex- 
pected cracks in one’s defenses. 

Taking Hellstrom’s long silence 
as rebuke, Saldo lowered his gaze. 
“We do not know all that may hap- 
pen to us, but we must be prepared 
anyway. I see that now.’’ 



Hellstrom felt like crying out, I 
am not perfect! I am not invincible! 

Instead he asked, “How is Pro- 
ject Forty coming?’’ 

“How did you know I had just in- 
quired of it?’’ Saldo asked, awe in 
his tone. “I didn’t mention it.’’ 

“All of us who carry the extra 
burden of awareness are inquiring 
regularly of Project Forty,’’ 
Hellstrom chided. “What did you 
find?’’ 

“Nothing new — really. Oh, they 
are building the new test model 
swiftly and it will — ’’ 

“Have they changed their 
opinion about its prospects?’’ 

“They are raising new arguments 
about the generation of extremely 
high heat.’’ 

“Is there more?’’ 

Saldo lifted his gaze, studied 
Hellstrom. Despite the Prime 
Male’s obvious fatigue, there re- 
mained one more matter that could 
not be avoided. 

“A band of the hydroponics 
harvesters was found wandering in 
the upper levels about an hour 
ago,’’ Saldo said. “As nearly as we 
can determine they were expressing 
a need to go to the surface.’’ 
Hellstrom sat upright on the bed, 
shock suppressing his fatigue. 
“Why wasn’t I told immediately?’’ 
“We handled it,” Saldo said. “It 
was blamed on the general distur- 
bance. They’ve all been chemically 
adjusted and are back at work. I’ve 
instituted patrols in all of the 
galleries to prevent a recurrence. 
Have I done wrong?” 

“No.” Hellstrom lay back on the 
bed. 

Patrols! Of course, that was all 
they could do now. But this told 



PROJECT 40 



131 




how deeply disturbed the entire 
Hive had become. Fancy was 
right — the predictions about the 
swarming urge had not taken into 
account a crisis such as this one. 

“Were there breeders among 
them?” Hellstrom asked. 

“A few potentials, but they — ” 
“They were swarming, right?” 
Hellstrom said. 

“Nils! Just a few workers 
from — ” 

“Nevertheless, they were swarm- 
ing. It is there in the calculations 
of our earliest written records. You 
know this. We have watched for it 
and tried to predict it from the first. 
And without our leadership’s being 
able to set the exact moment, we 
have reached a critical condition.” 
“Nils, the—” 

“You were going to speak about 
numbers. This is not a mere conse- 
quence of numbers. Total popu- 
lation in a given space figures in our 
calculations, but this is something 
else. Young workers and potential 
breeders, at the very least, find 
themselves driven to leave the Hive. 
They were striking out on their 
own. That is swarming.” 

“How can we prevent a — ” 
“Perhaps we cannot.” 

“But we can’t allow it now!” 
“Yes, we must do our best to 
delay the swarming. To let them go 
now would destroy us. Have the fil- 
ters turned back to maximum for a 
few hours and then adjust them to 
optimum.” 

“Nils, a suspicious Outsider in 
our midst might — ” 

“We cannot do otherwise. 
Desperate measures are required. 
A quiet weeding of population may 
be indicated if this — ” 



“The vats?” 

“Yes, if the pressure becomes too 
great.” 

“The hydroponics workers 
who — ” 

“Watch them carefully,” Hell- 
strom said. “And the breeders — 
even Fancy and her sisters. A 
swarm will need breeders.” 

XVIII 

Peruge’s private instruction to 
Daniel Thomas (DT) Alden: 
Janvert has come into 
possession of the special signal 
corps number and code re- 
quired to call the President. If 
you see any attempt by Janvert 
to make such a call, any se- 
cretive attempt to use a 
telephone, you are to stop him, 
using whatever force you find 
necessary. 

P IERUGE tuned in a symphony 
concert on the motel room’s 
radio under the mistaken idea that 
it might distract him. Time and 
again he found his awareness re- 
turning to contemplation of that 
disturbing woman at Hellstrom’s 
farm. 

Fancy. 

What an odd name that was. 

This motel had been chosen be- 
cause it provided him with a room 
whose rear windows gave line-of- 
sight communication with the 
Steens Mountain camps where his 
backup teams had stationed 
themselves in the guise of vaca- 
tioners. Peruge knew he had only to 
signal out that rear window and he 
could be in direct touch with any 
one of the three teams — nine 



132 



GALAXY 




people. The laser-transceiver would 
catch their voices as clearly as if 
they stood in the room with him. 

It bothered Peruge that he had 
allowed Shorty Janvert to remain 
in charge of the teams on the moun- 
tain. Damn that slimy-minded 
Merrivale! 

This was not a reassuring situa- 
tion and, as night gathered over the 
brown countryside beyond his 
room, Peruge reviewed his instruc- 
tions and his preparations. Had he 
been wise to restrict Janvert by the 
explicit order: You’re to report 
everything to headquarters before 
initiating non-specified movements 
during those periods when I’m out 
of communication on that farm. 

The specified movements were 
extremely few and limited in scope: 
trips to Fosterville for groceries and 
visual check on Lincoln Kraft; shift 
of campsite to meet necessities of 
protecting the overall cover; visits 
between camps to transfer the 
watch and maintain constant sur- 
veillance. 

So far Janvert had given no overt 
indication of untrustworthiness. 
His communications fitted all the 
reliability requirements. Tonight’s 
was no exception. 

“Does the Chief know you’re 
going in there without communica- 
tions?’’ 

“Yes.’’ 

“I don’t like that.’’ 

“I’m the one to worry about that, 
not you.’’ Peruge had countered. 
Who did Janvert think he was? 

“I’d like to see inside that place 
myself,’’ Janvert said. 

“You’re not to make any such at- 
tempt without specific advice from 
headquarters and then only if I 



have been out of communication 
beyond a pre-set time limit.’’ 

“.I don’t doubt your capabilities,’’ 
Janvert said, his tone remarkably 
conciliatory. “I’m just worried 
about all the things we don’t know 
in this case. Hellstrom displays a 
remarkable lack of respect for our 
persons.’’ 

Peruge suspected Janvert of 
trying to fabricate a tone of real 
concern where none existed, felt im- 
patient with such embroidery. 

“The farm is my problem,’’ Pe- 
ruge said. “Your problem is to ob- 
serve and report.” 

“Fat chance we get to observe 
while you’re in there without a 
transmitter.” 

“You still can’t find a weak spot 
in their armor?” 

“I’d have told you first thing if I 
had.” 

“Don’t get upset about it. I know 
you’re trying.” 

“There’s not a sound behind 
those walls. They must have a so- 
phisticated damper system of some 
kind. Plenty of odd sounds in the 
valley, but nothing we can really 
identify. Machinery, mostly and it 
sounds like heavy machinery. I sus- 
pect they have equipment suffi- 
ciently sophisticated to have spot- 
ted our probes. Sampson and Rio 
are moving their rig to grid position 
G-6 some time tonight. They did 
most of the probing.” 

“You’re staying put?” 

“Yes.” 

J ANVERT was taking all the 
right precautions, Peruge 
thought. Why do / distrust him? 
Would the little runt always live 
under the cloud generated by his 



PROJECT 40 



133 




reluctant recruitment? Peruge felt 
angry with himself. It was disloyal 
to entertain the thoughts flowing 
through his mind. What was the 
Chief really doing? 

Did the Chief consider Dzule Pe- 
ruge just another one of the many 
expendables? 

And the magnetic woman at 
Hellstrom’s farm — was she just 
teasing him? Some women con- 
sidered him handsome and his big 
body exuded animal power — which 
might explain most of what had 
happened up there. 

Nuts! Hellstrom put her up to it! 
“You still there?” Janvert asked. 
“Yes!” Voice angry and sharp. 
“What gave you the idea there 
might be more people on that farm 
than we can see? The tunnel?” 

“That — yes, but there’s more 
that you can’t put your finger on. 
Record this for transmission, 
Shorty. I want a watch put on the 
ordinary supplies going into that 
place. How much food, that sort of 
thing? Be discreet, but pry.” 

“I’ll take care of it. Do you want 
DT assigned to that?” 

“No. Send Nick. I want an esti- 
mate on how many people would 
match the normal food orders.” 
“Right. Did the Chief tell you 
about the diamond bits for well 
drills?” 

“Yes. They would have been de- 
livered just about the time Carlos 
and Tymiena were supposed to be 
there.” 

“Weird, isn’t it?” 

“It fits an odd kind of pattern,” 
Peruge said. “We just haven’t 
found the precise nature of the pat- 
tern.” He cast about in his mind, 
wondering at the reason for dia- 



mond drill bits in a movie com- 
pany. There was just no explaining 
it and no sense wondering without 
more evidence. More likely to come 
up with a wrong answer than a right 
one — and either way he couldn’t be 
certain. 

“I agree,” Janvert said. 
“Anything more for this report.” 

“Nothing.” Peruge signed off, re- 
placed the equipment in its cover- 
packaging, stored it in his shaving 
kit. 

Janvert had been more talkative 
than usual. Those surface attempts 
to be pleasant couldn’t be anything 
but false from that feisty little bas- 
tard. 

Peruge thought about this as he 
lay in the quiet darkness of his 
motel bed. He knew he had been 
cut off. He was alone, removed 
even from the protection of the 
Chief, and he wondered why he 
went on. 

Because I want to be rich, he 
thought. Richer than the bitch of 
the board. I will be, too, if I can get 
my hands on Hellstrom’s Project 
40 .

transmitter is in his 
X wristwatch,” Saldo said. 
^^We caught it just before he turned 
the thing off.” 

“Good work,” Hellstrom said. 

They stood in the electronic 
gloom of the barn aerie, the Se- 
curity command post. Workers 
were going about their jobs quietly 
all around, a single-minded deter- 
mination reflected in every 
movement. Nothing would get 
through this guard. 

“Those probes we detected came 
from Steens Mountain,” Saldo 
said. “We’ve located the position 
on the chart.” 

“Excellent. Is their lack of suc- 
cess igniting a renewed effort or are 
they quiet now?” 

“Quiet. I’ve arranged to send a 
picnic party into the area tomor- 
row. They’ll play and enjoy 
themselves and report back tomor- 
row night. The party will be com- 
posed only of extremely ex- 
perienced fronts.” 

“Don’t count on their learning 
much.” 

Saldo nodded agreement. 

Hellstrom closed his eyes tightly 
in distress and fatigue. He couldn’t 
seem to get enough rest and what 
little he got failed to restore him. 
What they needed and would never 
find was a way to send Peruge 
packing, a way to answer all his 
questions without answering them. 
Those mysterious, probing ques- 
tions about metallurgy and new in- 
ventions irritated Hellstrom. What 



could that possibly have to do with 
Project 40? New invention — yes, 
possibly. But metallurgy? He de- 
cided to communicate his question 
to the lab at the earliest op- 
portunity.

How primitive and far behind

wild Outside! 

P ^ERUGE heard the scratching 
at his door as part of a dream. It 
was a dog from his childhood 
calling him to get up for breakfast. 
Good old Danny. He could see the 
wide, ugly face, the dripping jowls, 
in his dream. He actually felt the 
fact that he was in bed, clad only in 
pajama bottoms as had always been 
usual for him. Abruptly circuits 
closed in his memory. That dog had 
been dead for years! He was awake 
instantly, silent and probing with 
all of his senses for evidence of 
danger. 

The scratching continued. 

He slipped his heavy automatic 
from under his pillow, rose and 
went to the door. The floor was 
cold against his bare feet. Standing 
at one side with the weapon ready, 
he jerked the door open on its 
chain. 

There was a nightlight outside his 
door. It cast a yellow glow on 
Fancy, who stood there wrapped in 
something furry, dark and bulky. 
She supported a bicycle with her 
left hand. 

Peruge closed the door, released 
the chain, swung the door wide. He 
knew he appeared strange standing 
there in his pajama bottoms with a 
big mankiller automatic in his 



PROJECT 40 



135 




hand, but he sensed the urgent need 
to get her out of sight in his room. 

He felt a surge of elation. They 
had sent this little vixen to com- 
promise him — but he had one of 
them outside their goddamned 
farm! 

Fancy entered the motel room 
without speaking, wheeling her 
bicycle. She leaned the cycle 
against the wall as Peruge closed 
and locked the door. When he 
turned toward her she was facing 
him and removing her outer 
garment, a long fur coat. She threw 
the coat over the bicycle’s handle- 
bars, stood in the thin white smock 
she had worn when he had last seen 
her. Her eyes were focused intently 
on his with a smoky, mocking look. 

Fun first? Peruge wondered. Or 
business first? His hand was slip- 
pery with perspiration against the 
butt of the automatic. God, she was 
a sexy bitch! 

He went to the window beside the 
door, slipped back the draperies, 
peered out. He could see no 
watchers. He crossed to the rear 
window, looked out over the 
parking lot toward the mountain. 
No prying strangers were visible 
there, either. Nobody. What time 
was it, for Christ’s sake? And why 
wasn’t the bitch talking? He crossed 
to the nightstand, lifted his wrist- 
watch. 1:28 A.M. 

Fancy watched all of this activity, 
a small smile on her lips. Outsiders 
were strange creatures. This one 
appeared even stranger than usual. 
Their bodies told them what they 
should do and they constantly dis- 
obeyed. Well, she had come pre- 
pared. 

Peruge glanced at her from his 



position by the nightstand. Her 
hands were clenched into fists, but 
she appeared to be carrying no 
weapon. He slipped his gun into a 
drawer of the stand. Was she being 
quiet because the room had been 
bugged? That couldn’t be — he had 
made certain the room was clean. 
He moved carefully, not turning his 
back on her. Why had she come on 
a bicycle? And in a fur coat, for the 
love of god! He wondered if he 
should alert the nightwatch on the 
mountain. Not yet. Fun first. 

Fancy reached up with her left 
hand as though she had read his 
mind, unbuttoned the front of her 
smock, shrugged out of it and let it 
fall. She stood there naked, a 
sensuous pocket-Venus body which 
sent his pulse racing. There were 
open sandals on her feet. She 
kicked them off, stirring up trails of 
dust from her ride into town. 

Peruge, his eyes glittering, wet his 
lips and said, “Aren’t you some- 
thing!” 

Still without speaking. Fancy ap- 
proached him, reached up and 
clasped both his bare arms. His left 
arm tingled as she touched it and he 
smelled a sudden, heavy musk. His 
gaze jerked toward the tingling in 
shocked alarm and he saw a tiny, 
flesh-colored ampule crushed be- 
neath her forefinger against his 
skin, a fleck of his own blood there. 
In his panic he knew he should hurl 
her away from him, call for help 
from his nightwatch, but his 
muscles remained frozen while that 
tingling spread through his body. 
His gaze slipped from the ampule 
on his arm to Fancy’s firm breasts, 
the dark nipples protruding with 
sensual tensions.

As though a mind-obscuring fog 
were creeping up from his loins, Pe- 
ruge felt his will dissolve until his 
only awareness was of the woman 
who was now clinging to him, 
pressing against him with 
surprising strength, forcing him 
backward onto the bed. 

Fancy spoke. “You want to breed 
with me? That’s good.” 

From the Hive Manual: A 
basic aim of the socializing 
process should be to create the 
widest possible tolerance of di- 
versity among the society’s 
components. 

<<T7ANCY’S missing,” Saldo 
X7 said. 

He had come in person to 
Hellstrom’s quarters, racing down 
the corridors and galleries which 
never lacked activity, ignoring the 
upset his running passage created 
among the workers. 

Hellstrom sat upright in his bed, 
rubbing sleep from his eyes, 
shaking his head to wake himself. 
He had been in deep sleep, his first 
in days, trying for a good rest be- 
fore tomorrow’s certain con- 
frontation with Peruge. 

He peered up at Saldo’s 
frightened face in the cell glow. 
“Alone? She left alone?” 

“Yes.” 

Hellstrom exhaled a sigh of 
relief. “How did she get out of the 
Hive? Where is she?” 

“She used that faulty emergency 
ventilator in the rock at the north 
perimeter. She had a bicycle.” 
“Weren’t there guards?” 

“She stunned them with de-hyp.” 
“But the Security watch!” 



“They missed it,” Saldo 
confessed. “She’s obviously used 
this route before. She went into the 
trees and avoided every one of our 
detectors.” 

She would, of course, Hellstrom 
thought. A bicycle? Why a bicycle? 
Where had she gone? “How did she 
get a bicycle?” he asked. 

“It’s the one we took from the 
Outsider, Depeaux.” 

“What was that still doing 
around? Why wasn’t it reduced for 
salvage?” 

“Some of the engineers were 
playing with it. They were thinking 
of manufacturing our own model to 
speed up delivery service in the 
lower galleries.” 

“Which direction did she go?” 
Hellstrom levered himself out of 
the bed. What time was it? He 
glanced at the crystal clock on his 
wall: 3:51 a.m. 

“She apparently went across the 
Palmer bridge. There are tracks.” 

Toward town then. Why? 

“The guards she stunned say she 
was wearing Outsider garments,” 
Saldo said. “Wardrobe reports a 
fur coat missing. She was into Hive 
stores again, too. We haven’t de- 
termined yet what she took.” 

“How long has she been gone?” 
Hellstrom asked. He slippfed his 
feet into Hive sandals, groped for a 
robe. 

“Almost four hours,” Saldo said. 
“Guards were unconscious for a 
long time.” He rubbed at the 
healing wound on his jaw. “I’m 
sure she’s gone into town. Two 
chemical trackers went as far along 
her trail as they dared. She was still 
headed for town when they broke 
off.” 



PROJECT 40

“Peruge,” Hellstrom said. 

“What?” 

“She’s gone to breed with Pe- 
ruge.” 

“Of course! Shall I call Line and 
have him — ” 

“No.” Hellstrom shook his head 
from side to side. 

Saldo trembled with impatience. 
“But that bicycle belonged to one 
of Peruge’ s agents!” 

“Who identifies bicycles? They’re 
not likely to make the connection. 
Fancy won’t tell him where that 
machine came from.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“I’m sure. Fancy has a one-track 
mind where breeding is concerned. 
I should have anticipated this when 
I saw her go on the attack with Pe- 
ruge as target.” 

“That man is clever! She could 
tell him something without even 
realizing it.” 

“A possibility we’ll have to inves- 
tigate. But for now you will alert 
Line. Tell him where she is and see 
that he makes certain they don’t 
take her away for interrogation. Pe- 
ruge is sure to have his friends 
watching him. We don’t want any 
more activity around that motel 
than is absolutely necessary.” 

S ALDO stared at Hellstrom in 
shocked silence. He had ex- 
pected Hellstrom to call up all of 
the Hive’s defensive resources. This 
was not an adequate response! 

“Any more indications of 
swarming pressure?” Hellstrom 
asked. 

“No. The — the ventilation ap- 
pears to have helped.” 

“Fancy is fertile,” Hellstrom 
said. “Getting her pregnant by an 



Outsider will help, too. She be- 
comes quite tractable while pro- 
ducing a child.” 

“Ah — ” Saldo stood in admi- 
ration of Hellstrom’s wisdom. 

“I know what she took from 
stores,” Hellstrom said. “She will 
have a male sex-fraction in an am- 
pule to hype up this Peruge. She 
wants to breed with him, that’s all. 
Let her. Outsiders have extremely 
odd reactions to this natural form 
of human behavior.” 

“So it is said,” Saldo murmured. 
“I’ve studied the behavioral precau- 
tions for work Outside.” 

“Depend on it,” Hellstrom said, 
smiling. “I have seen this happen 
many times. Peruge will show up 
here tomorrow the figure of con- 
trition. He will be with Fancy and 
very defensive. He will feel guilty. 
That will make him vulnerable to 
us. Yes — I believe I know how to 
handle this situation now, thanks to 
Fancy. Bless her.” 

“What are you saying?” 

“The wild Outsiders aren’t all 
that different from us chemically. It 
took Fancy to remind me of this. 
The same techniques we use to 
make our workers tractable, do- 
mesticated and yielding to the 
Hive’s needs will work on Out- 
siders.” 

“In their food?” 

“Or their water or even their 
air.” 

“Are you sure Fancy will 
return?” Saldo could not keep 
down the niggling doubt. 

“I’m sure.” 

“But the bicycle — ” 

“Do you really think they’ll iden- 
tify it?” 

“We cannot risk that they will!” 



138 



GALAXY 




“If it makes you feel better, warn 
Line about this possibility. I think 
Peruge’s senses will be so dulled 
after a night of hyped-up breeding 
with Fancy that he wouldn’t even 
recognize a bicycle when he saw it.” 
Saldo frowned. There was a 
manic note to Hellstrom’s manner 
and voice that was deeply dis- 
turbing. “1 don’t like this, Nils.” 
“You will,” Hellstrom assured 
him. “Trust me. Tell Line you are 
sending in a special security team. I 
want their instructions to be ex- 
plicit, no misunderstandings. Go 
over them with the utmost care. 
They are not to interfere tonight. 
Their major task is to insure that 
Fancy is not removed from that 
motel. She must spend an uninter- 
rupted night with Peruge. In the 
morning, they are to collect her at 
the first opportunity and bring her 
to me. I wish to thank her in 
person. The Hive does learn — it 
does react to danger as a single or- 
ganism. It is just as I have always 
suspected.” 

“I agree we should make sure she 
gets back here,” Saldo said. “But 
thank her?” 

“Naturally.” 

“For what?” 

“For reminding us that Outsiders 
share our chemistry.”

P I ERUGE awoke in the gray 
dawn gloom, swimming up to 



consciousness from some faraway, 
energy-drained place. He turned his 
head to see the tangled confusion of 
his bed, came to the slow realiza- 
tion that he was alone in the bed 
and that this should be important 
information. A bicycle with a coat 
thrown over the handlebars stood 
against the wall beside the door. A 
crumpled white garment lay on the 
floor between bed and door. He 
stared at the bicycle, wondering 
why he felt that a bicycle should be 
so important. 

A bicycle? 

Water splashed in the bathroom. 
Someone was humming. 

Fancy! 

He pushed himself to a sitting 
position, his mind as muddled as 
the bed. Fancy! For the love of 
God! What had she used on him? 
He had a foggy remembrance of 
what he thought were eighteen 
orgasms. An aphrodisiac? If so, it 
was more potent than anything in 
his wildest fantasies. 

Water still splashed in the 
bathroom. She was taking a 
shower. God! How could she move? 

He tried to reassemble the night 
in his memory, met only the wildest 
confusion, a recurrent image of 
writhing flesh. He thought; That 
was me! For God’s sake! That was 
me! What was that stuff Fancy had 
given him? Could that be Project 
40, for the love of heaven? He 
wanted to laugh hysterically, but 
couldn’t summon the strength. The 
sound of splashing water came to 
an abrupt stop. His attention 
moved to the bathroom door. 
Movement there, the voice hum- 
ming. Where did she get the 
strength? 



PROJECT 40 



139 




The door opened and Fancy 
emerged, a towel wrapped around 
her loins, another towel in her 
hands with which she was drying 
her hair. 

“Good morning, lover,” she said. 
She thought; He looks completely 
used up. 

He stared at her without 
speaking, memory searching. 

“Didn’t you like breeding with 
me?” she asked. 

That y\>as it! he thought. That had 
been the thing he had tried to re- 
member but couldn’t until she 
spoke. Breed with her? Could she 
be one of those kooky, turned-on 
members of the new genera- 
tion — sex for procreation only? 

“What did you do to me?” he 
asked. His voice came out in a 
husky croaking which shocked him. 

“Do? I just— ” 

He lifted his left arm to expose 
the area where she had injected him 
with that mysterious musky 
substance. Faint discoloration there 
revealed a subcutaneous bruise. 

“Oh, that,” she said. “Didn’t you 
like it when you were hyped up?” 

He levered himself back against 
the bed’s headrest, adjusted a 
pillow behind him. God, he was 
tired. “Hyped,” he said. “So you 
shot me with some kind of dope.” 

“I only gave you an additional 
store of what every male has when 
he’s ready to breed,” she said, 
knowing her tone betrayed her own 
puzzlement. Outsiders were so 
strange about breeding. 

Peruge’s head ached and he felt 
that her words increased the pain. 
He turned slowly, looked squarely 
at her. God! What a voluptuous 
body! He spoke painfully, but 



clearly. “What’s this breeding 
crap?” 

“I know you use other words for 
what we did,” she explained, trying 
to sound reasonable, “but that’s 
what we like to call it — breeding.” 

“We?” 

“My — friends and I.” 

“You breed with them?” 

“Sometimes.” 

He thought. Crazy communal 
hop heads! Could that be what 
Hellstrom was hiding — sex orgies 
and aphrodisiac drugs? Peruge felt 
a deep and sudden prurient envy. 
Suppose that was what these cra- 
zies did! Suppose they had regular 
parties such as the one he’d ex- 
perienced with Fancy. It was 
wrong, of course. But what a hold 
an experience like that could get on 
a man! On a woman, too, no doubt. 

It was criminal to do such things, 
but . 

Fancy dropped her towels, began 
putting on her smock, seemingly 
with no more concern about her 
nudity than she had experienced the 
night before. 

Despite his headache and pro- 
found lassitude, Peruge marveled at 
her sensuous grace. She was all 
woman! 

AS SHE dressed. Fancy admitted 
J\. to herself that she felt hungry 
and she wondered if Peruge had 
money to buy breakfast. She 
enjoyed the thought of exotic Out- 
sider food, but she had not prepared 
herself with money from Hive 
stores before sneaking out. 

I was in a hurry, she thought, and 
could not suppress a joyful giggle. 
The wild Outsider males were such 
fun when one hyped them, as 



140 



GALAXY 




though their suppressed breeding 
energies had been stored up for just 
such an occasion. 

As he watched Fancy dress, Pe- 
ruge found his original worries 
about her returning. What had 
driven her to his bed? Breeding? 
Nonsense. She had come into 
possession of an undoubted aph- 
rodisiac, though. He couldn’t deny 
this. His own behavior in the night 
gave ample testimony to this. 

Eighteen times! 

Something was very sick up there 
at that farm. 

Breeding! 

“Have you had any babies?” 

“Oh, several,” she said, then 
realized it had been wrong to admit 
this. Her own training in Outsider 
sex inhibitions had been explicit on 
that score. Her personal ex- 
periences had reinforced the 
training. Now it was a potentially 
dangerous admission. Peruge had 
no way of knowing how old she 
was. Old enough to be his mother, 
no doubt. That Hive-difference 
between appearance and age was 
one of the things that could never 
be shared with Outsiders. She felt 
an abrupt resurgence of Hive- 
caution. 

Her answer astonished him. 
“Several? Where are they?” 

“Oh — with friends.” She tried to 
act casual and unconcerned, but 
was now fully alert. Peruge must be 
diverted. “You want to breed some 
more?” she asked. 

But Peruge was not to be shunted 
from this fascinating disclosure. 
“Don’t you have a husband?” 

“Oh, no.” 

“Who fathered your several chil- 
dren?” he asked, then realized he 



probably should have asked about 
fathers, plural. 

His questions increased her 
nervousness. “I don’t want to talk 
about it.” Admitting that she had 
borne children had been a mistake. 
Hive-consciousness restored other 
memories of the night with Peruge, 
as well. The Outsider had made 
interesting admissions while in the 
throes of breeding ecstasy. There 
had been, for a time, a level of his 
deepest awareness completely open 
to her. Moving with an elaborate 
show of casualness, she crossed to 
the bicycle, took up the long fur 
coat, held it over her arm. 

“Where are you going?” he de- 
manded. He forced his legs off the 
edge of the bed, let them fall to the 
cold floor, which restored some of 
his energy. His head whirled with 
fatigue and there was an aching in 
his chest. What the hell had been in 
that shot? She had really used him 
up. 

“I’m hungry,” she explained. 
“Can I leave the bicycle while I go 
out and eat? Maybe we can breed 
some more later.” 

“Eat?” His stomach rebelled at 
the thought. 

“There’s a cafe just down the 
street,” she said. “I’m very 
hungry — ” she giggled — “after — ” 

She has to come back and get her 
damned bicycle, he thought. He 
realized he was no match for her in 
his present weakened condition. He 
would have a reception committee 
ready for her when she did return, 
though. He was going to unravel 
the mystery of Nils Hellstrom and 
the beginning of the thread was 
named Fancy. 

“Just down to the cafe,” he said. 



PROJECT 40 



141 




as though he were explaining it to 
himself. He recalled seeing the neon 
sign. 

“I like an — breakfast,” she said 
and swallowed in a sudden chill. 
Nervousness had almost tripped 
her into saying “an Outsider 
breakfast.” Outsider was a word 
one did not use with Outsiders. She 
covered her slip, asking, “Do you 
have any money? I sneaked out in 
such a hurry last night I didn’t 
bring any.” 

Peruge gestured to his trousers on 
a chair across the room. “Hip 
pocket. Wallet.” He put his head in 
his hands. The effort of sitting up 
had taken a frightening amount of 
his reserves, and the chest pain, the 
headache left him confused. He 
realized he was going to have to put 
out a tremendous effort to stand up. 
Maybe a cold shower would help. 
He heard Fancy fumbling for the 
money, couldn’t bring himself to 
look at her. 

Take it all! Damned bitch! 

“I’m taking five dollars,” she 
said. “Is that all right?” 

I often pay more, he thought. But 
she obviously was no regular 
whore — or she would have taken 
all. 

“Sure, anything you need.” 

“Should I bring you coffee or 
something?” she asked. He really 
did look sick. She found herself 
worrying about him. 

Peruge swallowed an upsurge of 
nausea, gestured weakly. “No I, 
uh — I’ll get something later.” 

“You’re sure?” 

“I’m sure.” 

“All right, then.” His appearance 
worried her, but she reached for the 
door handle to let herself out. 



Perhaps he just needed a little more 
rest. 

She called cheerfully as she 
opened the door, “I’ll be right 
back.” 

“Wait,” he said. He dropped his 
hands from his face, lifted his head 
with an application of conscious ef- 
fort. 

“Did you change your mind 
about my bringing you something?” 
she asked. 

“No. I — ^just — wondered. So we 
bred. Do you expect to have a baby 
by me?” 

“I certainly hope so. I’m right at 
the top of my fertility.” She smiled 
disarmingly, added: “I’m going to 
go eat now. I’ll be back before you 
know it. Everybody says I’m a fast 
eater.” 

She went out, closing the door 
briskly behind her. 

'P'AST breeder, too, he thought. 
M Her answer only added to his 
confusion. What the hell had he run 
into? A baby? Was this what Carlos 
had discovered? He had a sudden 
vision of the dapper Carlos De- 
peaux held in some subterranean 
bondage by Fancy and her friends, 
a continual hyped-up orgy with that 
mysterious aphrodisiac for as long 
as it lasted. Or for as long as Carlos 
lasted. Peruge tried to visualize a 
continual orgy of breeding — babies 
on an assembly line. Somehow he 
could not imagine Carlos fitting in. 
Certainly, he couldn’t see Tymiena 
in it or even Porter. Tymiena had 
never struck him as the motherly 
type. And dry-as-dust Porter ran 
from intimate encounters with 
women. 

Hellstrom was involved in some- 



142 



GALAXY 




thing to do with sex, though — and it 
was probably dirty as hell. 

Peruge rubbed a hand across his 
forehead. The motel had provided 
an in-room coffeemaker with paper 
packets of instant brew. He lurched 
to his feet, found the equipment in 
the closet alcove beside the 
bathroom door, heated water and 
made two cups. He drank it much 
too hot. His mouth felt scalded af- 
terward, but the coffee gave him a 
lift and reduced the throbbing in his 
head. He could think a bit more 
clearly now. He put the front door 
on the chain latch and got out his 
transceiver. 

The second signal burst at the 
mountains brought contact with 
Janvert. Peruge’s hands were 
unsteady, but he brought a chair to 
the window, rested the equipment on 
the sill and set himself grimly to the 
task of reporting. They exchanged 
code-recognition signals and Pe- 
ruge launched himself into the 
whole story of his night with Fancy, 
sparing nothing. 

“Eighteen times?” Janvert 
sounded unbelieving. 

“As nearly as I can remember.” 

“You must’ve had some time.” 
The beam transceiver failed to 
mask Janvert’s tone of cynical 
amusement. 

“Don’t give me any crap,” Pe- 
ruge growled. “She shot me full of 
something, an aphrodisiac or some- 
thing, and I was just a big, eager 
bundle of flesh. See if you can keep 
this on a professional level, will 
you? We have to find out what it 
was that she gave me.” He glanced 
down at the bruise on his arm. 

“How do you propose doing 
that?” 



“I’m going up there today. I may 
brace Hellstrom about it.” 

“That might not be too wise. 
Have you checked with HQ? . 

“The Chief wants — I’ve 

checked!” Christ! It was too dif- 
ficult to explain that the Chief had ' 
ordered direct negotiations. This 
development couldn’t change that. 
It only added to the things to be in- 
troduced in the negotiations. 

“You play it cool,” Janvert said. 
“Remember, we already have three 
people missing.” 

Did Janvert take him for an idiot, 
for Christ’s sake? 

Peruge massaged his right 
temple. God, his head felt as empty 
as his body. She had really drained 
him. 

“How did this dame get down 
from the farm?” Janvert asked. 
“Nightwatch didn’t report any car 
headlights out that way.” 

“She rode a bicycle, you 
damn fool! Didn’t I already tell you 
that?” 

“No, you didn’t. Are you sure 
you’re feeling all right?” 

“I’m just a little tired.” 

“That I can understand.” There 
he went with the goddamned humor 
again! “So she rode a bicycle. You 
know, that’s interesting.” 

“What’s interesting?” 

“Carlos was a bicycle nut. The 
Portland office said he took a bike 
with him in the van. Remember?” 
Peruge glanced back at the 
bicycle leaning against the wall. He 
did remember, now that Shorty 
mentioned it. A bicycle. Was that 
possible? By any stretch of good 
fortune, could that set of flimsy 
wheels be linked to Depeaux? “Do 
we have a serial number or 



PROJECT 40 



143 




anything else to identify Carlos’s 
bicycle?” he asked. 

“Maybe. There might even be 
fingerprints. Where’s this bicycle 
now?” 

“Right here in the room with me. 
I’m bike-sitting while she gets 
breakfast.” He recalled his original 
resolve then. Christ almighty! His 
mind was going! “Shorty,” he 
barked, some of his old strength re- 
turning for a moment, “you get a 
team down here as soon as you can. 
Collect this bicycle, yes, but we 
have to get our hands on Fancy for 
a long and thorough interro- 
gation.” 

“That’s more like it,” Janvert 
said. “DT is right here listening to 
us and he’s all hot to go.” 

“No.” DT had to stay there and 
keep an eye on Janvert. The Chief 
had been explicit about that. “Send 
Sampson’s team.” 

“DT is seeing to it. They’ll be on 
their way in just a minute.” 

“Tell them to hurry, will you? I 
know only one way of delaying this 
dame and after last night I’m really 
not up to it.” 



XX 

The words of Nils Hellstrom: I 
remember my childhood in the 
Hive as the happiest period, the 
happiest experience a human 
could ever enjoy. Nothing I 
needed was denied me. I knew 
that all around me were people 
who would protect me with 
their lives. It came to me only 
gradually that I owed these 
people the same full measure of 
payment were it ever demanded 



of me. What a profound thing 
the insects have taught us! How 
different it is from the wild 
opinions about insects current 
Outside. Hollywood, for 
instance, has long contended 
that the mere threat of having 
an insect crawl upon your face 
is enough to make a grown 
man beg for mercy and tell 
every secret he ever knew. 
Philosopher Harl, the wisest of 
his specialty among us, tells me 
that from childhood night- 
mares to adult psychosis, 
the insect is a common horror 
fixation in the Outsider’s mind. 
How strange it is that Out- 
siders cannot look beyond the 
insect’s great strength and effi- 
cient face to see the lesson 
embodied there for us all. 
Lesson one, of course, is that 
the insect is never afraid to die 
for his bretheren. 

<< TTOW could they let those 
JLX Outsiders get away with 
that bicycle?” Hellstrom stormed. 

He stood almost in the center of 
Hive Central Security, a chamber 
deep within the Hive that could tap 
into and repeat the data collected 
from any of its internal and ex- 
ternal sensors. The room lacked 
only the positive direct visual 
backup of the barn aerie to make it 
the most important Security post in 
the Hive. Hellstrom often preferred 
this backup post to the aerie. The 
sense of bustling workers whose ac- 
tivities spread outward all around 
gave him a feeling of protection he 
believed helped his thought 
processes. 

Saldo, who had made the report. 



144 



GALAXY 




shuddered under the combined 
weight of Hellstrom’s wrath and his 
own complex personal know- 
ledge — not only of the danger 
this development brought, but of 
the judgment error which went 
directly back to the Prime Male. 
Saldo was shaken in his innermost 
being. If only Hellstrom had 
heeded the words of warning. If 
only — But it would not be wise to 
remind Hellstrom of this as yet. 

“Our surveillance workers did 
not know what was happening until 
too late,” Saldo explained. “Fancy 
had emerged earlier and they were 
lulled into a sense of complacency. 
A closed truck drove up. Four men 
went into Peruge’s room and two of 
them emerged, bringing the bicycle. 
They were driving away with it be- 
fore our people could get across the 
street to try to stop them. We 
pursued, but they were prepared for 
that and we were not. Another 
truck blocked our pursuit and let 
them get away. They were at the 
airport and the bicycle was gone be- 
fore we could catch up.” 

Hellstrom closed his eyes. His 
mind felt clotted with foreboding. 
“And all this time. Fancy was down 
the street at the restaurant eating 
Outsider foods.” 

“We’ve always known how she is 
about that,” Saldo said. “It’s a 
defect.” He made the vat sign, eye- 
brows raised questioningly. 

“No.” Hellstrom shook his head. 
“Don’t be too quick to discount her 
value to us. Fancy’s not yet ready 
for the vats. Where is she right 
now?” 

“Still at the restaurant.” 

“I thought I ordered her brought 



Saldo shrugged. 

Of course, Hellstrom thought. 
The workers were fond of Fancy 
and many of them knew about her 
defect. What harm was there in let- 
ting her finish a meal of exotic Out- 
sider food? Fondness could be a 
defect, too. “Have her picked up 
and brought back immediately,” he 
ordered. 

“I should have ordered that 
myself at once,” Saldo admitted. 
“No excuse. I was at my station 
monitoring our communications 
with town when — No excuse. All I 
thought of was hurrying down the 
gallery to you.” 

“I understand.” Hellstrom indi- 
cated a communications console 
ahead of him. 

Saldo moved to the station 
quickly, relayed Hellstrom’s order. 
It felt good to be taking positive 
action, but his deeper disturbance 
was not eased. What did Hellstrom 
mean with his mysterious allusions 
to Fancy’s value? How could she 
possibly help save the Hive with her 
behavior? But the Older Ones often 
did know things denied to the 
younger. Most of the Hive’s 
workers knew this. It did not seem 
possible that Fancy was helping, 
but the possibility could not be de- 
nied in the face of Hellstrom’s 
positive assertion. 



The words of Nils Hellstrom: 
There is another respect in 
which we must guard against 
becoming too much like the 
insects upon whom we pattern 
our design for human survival. 
The insect has been called a 
walking digestive tract. This is 



PROJECT 40 



145 




not without reason. To support 
his own life an insect will con- 
sume as much as a hundred 
times his own weight each 
day — which to each of us would 
be like eating an entire cow, a 
herd of thirty each month. To 
those who have witnessed the 
insect’s profligate display of 
appetite the outcome is clear. If 
allowed to continue on his re- 
productive rampage, the insect 
would defoliate Earth. Thus, 
with our lesson from the insect, 
comes a clear warning. If the 
race for food is to be the 
deciding conflict, let no one say 
it came without this warning. 
From the beginning of time 
wild humans have stood help- 
less, watching the very soil 
they nurtured give birth to a 
competitor that could outeat 
them. Just as we must not let 
our teacher, the insect, con- 
sume what we require for sur- 
vival, we must not launch a 
similar rampage of our own. 
The pace of our planet’s 
growing cycle cannot be de- 
nied. It is possible for insects or 
for man to destroy in a single 
week what could have fed 
millions for an entire year. 



“We lifted all of the prints we 
could en route and put everything 
on a chartered plane to Portland,” 
Jan vert said over the laser 

transceiver. “The preliminary 
report says some of the prints 
match the ones from the dame in 
your room. Have our boys picked 
her up yet?” 

“She got away,” Peruge growled. 

Clad only in a light robe, he sat in 



front of the window, looking out ut 
the morning light on the mountain 
and trying to keep his mind focused 
on the report. To do so was be- 
coming increasingly difficult. His 
chest ached with a demanding 
persistence and every movement 
took so much energy each time he 
wondered if he had any reserves 
left. 

“What happened?” Janvert 
asked. “Did our team slip up?” 

“No. I should have sent them to 
the cafe. We saw her come out and 
head back here, but three men 
drove up and intercepted her.” 
“They grabbed her?” 

“There was no struggle. Fancy 
just jumped into the car with them 
and they drove off. Our people 
weren’t in position. The van that 
helped us get away with the bike 
wasn’t back yet. Sampson ran out 
when we saw what was happening, 
but it all happened too quickly.” 
“She’s back at the farm, eh?” 
“I’m sure of it.” 

“Did you get a license number?” 
“They were too far away — but 
the number makes little dif- 
ference.” 

“So she just went along with 
them?” 

“That’s how it seemed. Sampson 
thought she looked unhappy about 
it, but she didn’t argue.” 

“Probably unhappy that she 
couldn’t come back and play with 
you some more,” Janvert said. 

“Stuff that,” Peruge snapped, 
then put a hand to his head. His 
brain felt blocked off, not working 
at all normally. He felt hemmed in 
by details and was aware of things 
slipping away front him. He really 
needed to take a cold shower, snap 



146 



GALAXY 




out of this fog and get ready to 
return to the farm. 

“I’ve been referring to the files,” 
Janvert said. “This Fancy fits the 
description of the Fancy Kalotermi 
who’s an officer of Hellstrom’s cor- 
poration.” 

Peruge sighed. “I know, I know.” 

“You feeling all right?” Janvert 
asked. “You’re sounding a little off 
your feed. Maybe that shot she 
gave you — ” 

“I’m okay.” 

“You don’t sound it. We don’t 
know what was in that stuff she 
used to charge you up last night. 
Maybe you’d better go out for a 
physical and we send in the second 
team.” 

“Meaning you,” Peruge growled. 

“Why should you have all the 
fun?” 

“I told you to stuff that. I’m all 
right. I’ll take a shower and get 
ready to go pretty soon. We have to 
find out how she did what she did.” 

“I want to be the first to know,” 
Janvert quipped. 

Damn fool! Peruge raged, rub- 
bing his head. God, how his head 
ached — and his chest. He had to go 
out on a job as touchy as this one 
and have to rely on a clown to back 
him up! It was too late too change 
that now, though. Peruge felt his 
hand tremble against his forehead. 

“You still there?” Janvert asked. 

Peruge winced at the sound. “I’m 
here.” 

“Wouldn’t it be a gas if this 
Project Forty turned out to be an 
aphrodisiac?” 

S HORTY was impossible. He 
was the perfect antithesis of 
everything Peruge needed right 



now. There was no doubt of the 
Tnalice in Janvert’s responses, no 
doubt of the man’s unreliability. 
What could be done to change that 
now, though? The teams were scat- 
tered all over the area. And he had 
to be up at that damned farm in a 
couple of hours. He didn’t know 
how he was going to manage that, 
but he had to. For a moment he 
tried to consider that Janvert’s 
cynical banter might contain a 
small seed of good sense. The effort 
was futile. What had that shot 
contained? Christ! If he could get a 
corner on that he would make more 
than with ten metallurgical 
processes. Make a fortune under 
the counter. 

“You’re taking an awful long 
time between answers,” Janvert 
said. “I’m going to send Clovis 
down to have a look at you. She’s 
had some nursing experience 
and — ” 

“She stays right there with you. 
That’s an order.” 

“That dame could have done a 
helluva lot more than just charge 
you up as a bed partner,” Janvert 
argued. 

“That’s all it was, dammit!” But 
Shorty’s words carried the seeds of 
panic. The night with Fancy had 
distorted his perceptions of many 
things, including his idea of 
woman. The uninhibited little slut! 

“I don’t like the way you sound 
at all,” Janvert said. “Is Sampson 
still around?” 

“I sent him back up to you.” 

“The backup van isn’t here yet. 
What if we — ” 

“You contact them the way I told 
you and get them back up there! 
You hear me. Shorty?” 



PROJECT 40 



147 




“But that would leave you in 
town alone. Hellstrom’s crowd 
could have a team there and we 
wouldn’t.” 

“They won’t dare to attack me.” 

“I think you’re wrong. 1 think 
they may already have attacked 
you. That town could be completely 
in their hands. The deputy sure as 
hell is.” 

“I’m ordering you to stay up 
there with all of your teams,” Pe- 
ruge said. 

“We could have you at a clinic in 
Portland within two hours,” 
Janvert said. “I’m going to call 
for — ” 

“I am ordering you not to 
contact headquarters,” Peruge 
said. 

“I think you’re out of your mind. 
A clinic might be able to examine 
you and tell us what was in that 
shot.” 

“Not likely. Christ! She said it 
was — a hormone or something.” 

“You believe that?” 

“It’s probably true. Sign off now 
and do what I told you.” He 
dropped a hand onto his own cut- 
off switch, heard the blip as the 
transceiver went dead. 

Damn! Everything took so 
damned much energy. 

Willing every movement, he put 
away the transceiver, went into the 
bathroom. A cold shower. That was 
what he needed. If he could only get 
fully awake. The bathroom still 
showed the scattered wetness of 
Fancy’s ablutions. He stepped into 
the tub, supported himself with a 
hand on the showerhead while he 
groped for the faucet. Cold water. 
He turned it on full. At the first 
shock of the chilling stream, he felt 



a sharp band of pain tighten on his 
forehead and chest. He staggered 
from the tub, trying to breathe, left 
the water running. He stumbled 
from the bathroom, dripping, 
knocked the remains of his coffee- 
making from the counter as he 
passed, but didn’t even hear it. The 
bed! He needed the bed. He flopped 
his wet body onto the bed, rolled 
onto his back. His chest was on fire, 
his skin trembling with a deep chill. 
It was so cold! He arched his back, 
tried to pull the bedding around 
himself, but his fingers lost their 
grip and his suddenly out-flung 
hand fell over the edge of the bed. 
He was dead before his relaxing fin- 
gers touched the floor. 

XXI 

The words of Nils Hell- 
strom: In the sense popularly 
believed Outside, it is not pos- 
sible to fight back against any 
aspect of nature. What must be 
understood is that we fit our- 
selves into existing patterns, 
adapting as our influence upon 
those processes brings about its 
inevitable change. The way the 
wild Outsiders fight insects is 
particularly enlightening. By 
opposing themselves to a 
powerful aspect of existing 
processed the wild one unwit- 
tingly add fuel to the defenses 
of those they oppose. The Out- 
siders’ poisons bring instant 
death to most insects. But the 
few who survive will develop 
an immunity, a tolerance to 
ingest the poison with no 
harmful effect. Returning to 
the womb of the Earth, these 



148 



GALAXY 




survivors pass on this im- 
munity to new generations of 
billions. 

T ’HE Hive seemed always so 
neat, efficient and reassuring 
after she had been Outside, Fancy 
thought. She admired the way her 
fellow workers moved about their 
tasks without fuss, with that quiet, 
purposeful air of knowing what 
they did. Even the escort taking her 
down the familiar galleries, down 
the relays of elevators, gave off this 
same air. She did not think of these 
people as her captors. They were 
fellow workers. It was good to get 
out of the Hive occasionally, but so 
much better to come back. Espe- 
cially with the almost certain 
knowledge that she had added to 
the Hive’s gene store by last night’s 
foray. The Hive comforted her 
mind and body now just by its 
presence around her. 

Outsiders could be great sport, 
too — especially the randy wild 
males. In her fifty-eight years. 
Fancy had brought nine Outsider- 
fathered babies into the Hive, each 
one of them concealed in the mys- 
terious fecundity of her body. Hers 
was a great contribution to the gene 
pool. She understood gene pools 
just as she understood insects. She 
was a specialist. Outsider males and 
ants were her special favorites. 

Sometimes as she watched an ant 
colony in the lab. Fancy felt that 
there might be a way for her to 
move right into the colony, perhaps 
even become its broodmother. It 
might merely require a period of 
chemical acclimatization for her 
charges to accept her as one of their 
own. In her fantasy, she could 



imagine the escort which now took 
her deep into the Hive as her own 
Queen’s guard. She would be the 
ant-queen. And the strange thing 
was that ants did tend to accept her. 
Ants, mosquitoes, many different 
kinds of insects showed no distur- 
bance at Fancy’s intrusions. 
Whenever she thought of this and 
conjured up attendant fantasies it 
was easy for her to imagine the 
Hive as her colony. 

So firmly had imagination taken 
hold of Fancy’s consciousness that 
when the escort brought her into 
Hellstrom’s presence, she looked 
upon him at first with queenly 
condescension and failed to observe 
his overwrought condition and 
tension. 

Hellstrom noted that she still 
wore the fur coat she’d taken from 
wardrobe and she appeared mighty 
proud of herself. He nodded to dis- 
miss her guards. They retreated 
into the background, but remained 
alert and observing. Saldo’s orders 
had been explicit about that. Much 
of Security was growing to recog- 
nize that Saldo possessed qualities 
that demanded obedience. In this 
room of the Hive’s inner security 
processes at least half of the 
workers had begun to harbor 
divided loyalties. 

“Well, Fancy,” Hellstrom said, 
his voice tired but carefully neutral. 

She perched on a corner of 
Hellstrom’s desk, grinned at him. 

Hellstrom took the chair behind 
the desk, sank into it, looked up at 
her. “Fancy, would you try to ex- 
plain to me what you thought you 
were doing in last night’s esca- 
pade?” 

“I merely spent the night 



PROJECT 40 



149 




breeding with your dangerous Mr. 
Peruge. He was about as fearsome 
as any other Outsider male I’ve 
ever met.” 

“You took supplies from Hives 
stores,” Hellstrom said. “Tell me 
about that.” 

“Just this coat and a shot of our 
own male breeder hormones,” she 
said. “I hyped him up.” 

“Did he respond?” 

“Just as the others always did.” 
“You’ve done this before?” 

“Lots of times.” Hellstrom was 
acting strangely, she thought. 

Hellstrom nodded to himself, 
tried to read another message into 
Fancy’s responses, something to 
confirm his suspicion that she was 
acting out of an awareness of the 
Hive’s most fundamental needs. 
Additions to the gene pool were 
beneficial, yes; and Peruge’s genes 
would be most welcome. But she 
had taken a prized Hive secret Out- 
side, risked Outsider discovery that 
the Hive possessed a profound 
knowledge of the workings of 
human hormones. By her present 
admission, she had done so more 
than once. If Outsiders learned 
some of the things the Hive could 
do in manipulation of human 
chemistry more problems would 
arise. 

“Did you ever discuss this with 
anyone?” Hellstrom asked. Surely, 
some circumstance must exist to 
explain her behavior. 

“I’ve talked about it with many 
of the breeder females,” she said. 
What could possibly be bothering 
old Nils? She saw now that he was 
working against deep tensions. 

“Your only discussions have been 
with breeder females?” 



“Yes. Many of us use the hor- 
mones when we go Outside.” 

Shocked, Hellstrom shook his 
head. Blessed Broodmother! And 
none of the Hive’s ruling specialists 
had ever once suspected! What else 
might be going on in the Hive? 

“Peruge’s friends have the 
bicycle,” Hellstrom said. 

She looked at him, not under- 
standing. 

“The bicycle you took when you 
sneaked into town,” Hellstrom ex- 
plained. 

“Oh. The workers who picked me 
up were so insistent they made me 
forget all about it.” 

“By taking that bicycle, you’ve 
created a crisis,” Hellstrom said. 

“How?” 

“Don’t you recall where we got 
that bicycle?” 



S HE put a hand over her mouth 
in sudden comprehension. All 
she had been thinking about a quick 
way to get into town when she had 
borrow^ the machine. A certain 
amount of pride had also been in- 
volved in the action. She was one of 
the few workers who had learned 
how to manage a bicycle Outside. 
She had demonstrated her ability 
for the engineers during the 
preceeding week, even taught one 
of them to ride it. But her ingrained 
Hive-protective sense was fully 
aroused now. If that bicycle could 
be traced to the couple the workers 
had thrown into the vats. 

“What can I do to get it back?” 
she asked. 

This is the Fancy I can work with 
and admire, Hellstrom thought, 
responding to her sudden alertness. 



150 



GALAXY 




“I don’t yet know,” he told her. 

“Peruge is coming to see you 
today,” she said. “Can I demand 
that he return it to me?” 

“It’s too late for th,at. They’ve 
sent it away in an airplane. That 
must mean they suspect.” 

She nodded. She knew about fin- 
gerprints and serial numbers. 

“Our best move may be to deny 
that we ever had that bicycle.” 

“No telling who may have seen 
you on it,” Hellstrom said. 

And he thought sadly to himself: 
Our best move may be to deny that 
Fancy exists. We have others with a 
close enough resemblance to her 
face and body. Were her finger- 
prints likely to be on any of the 
documents she had signed as Fancy 
Kalotermi? Not likely — they had 
since been handled by many. 

“I’ve done wrong, haven’t I?” 
Fancy asked, beginning to grasp the 
extent of the problem she had 
created. 

“It was wrong for you and other 
females to take Hive stores Out- 
side. It was wrong to take that 
bicycle/” 

“The bicycle — I see that now,” 
she admitted. “But the breeder- 
hyps only insured fertilization.” 
Even as she spoke Hive-honesty 
forced Fancy to admit to herself 
that this didn’t explain fully why 
she and the others used Hive stores 
this way. It had been an experiment 
at first, then a delightful discovery 
of how susceptible Outsider males 
were. She had shared the discovery 
with a few sisters. They had made 
up their own stories to explain to 
Outsider males who became cu- 
rious. This was an expensive new 
drug they had stolen. They might 



not be able to get more of it. Better 
to use it while they had it. 

“You must name all of the fe- 
males who shared your little trick,” 
Hellstrom said. 

“Oh, Nils!” 

“You must and you know it. All 
of you will give us detailed accounts 
concerning the reactions of Out- 
sider males, how curious any of 
them may have been, who they 
were, how many times you’ve 
raided Hive stores this way, 
everything.” 

She nodded dejectedly. It would 
have to be done, of course. The fun 
was ended. 

“On the basis of our review we 
may conduct some experiments 
Outside, fully controlled and ob- 
served,” Hellstrom said. “For that 
reason be explicitly detailed in your 
account. Anything you recall could 
be valuable.” 

“Yes, Nils.” She felt contrite 
now, but secretly elated. Perhaps 
the fun wasn’t ended. Controlled 
experiments meant further use of 
Hive methods on Outsiders. Who 
better qualified for such a project 
than those already experienced? 

“Fancy, Fancy,” Hellstrom said, 
shaking his head. “The Hive has 
never b^een in greater peril and you 
continue to play your games.” 

She clasped her arms around her 
body, hugging herself. 

“Why?” he asked. “Why?” 

She remained wordless. 

“We could even be forced to send 
you to the vats,” Hellstrom said. 

Her eyes went wide in alarm. She 
slipped off the desk, stood facing 
Hellstrom. The vats! But she was 
still young. She had many years of 
breeding service ahead of her. They

needed her talents with the insects, 
too. Nobody was better than she 
was with the insects! She began to 
voice these arguments, but 
Hellstrom cut her short. 

“Fancy. The Hive comes first.” 
His words shocked her and she 
recalled suddenly the thing she had 
reminded herself to tell Hellstrom. 
Certainly the Hive came first! Did 
he think her a moral reject? 

“I have something else to 
report,” she said. “It may be im- 
portant.” 

“Oh?” 

“The hyp hit Peruge very hard. 
He thought I was asking him ques- 
tions at one point. I wasn’t, but 
when I recognized what he was 
doing, I did ask questions. He 
wasn’t fully awake, just reacting. I 
think he spoke the truth.” 

“What did he say? Out with it.” 
“He said he had come to make a 
deal with you. He said their study 
of the papers they had 
found — about Project Forty, you 
understand — ^had led them to be- 
lieve you were developing a new 
way to shape metals. Steel, that 
sort of metal. He said a metallur- 
gical breakthrough could be worth 
billions. What he said didn’t always 
make sense, but that was the gist of 
it.” 

Hellstrom felt such elation at her 
words he wanted to get up and hug 
her. The Hive had been working 
through her! 

S ALDO came into the room as 
these thoughts/emotions 
coursed through Hellstrom and 
Hellstrom almost called the young 
male over to explain. Fancy’s dis- 
covery gave the Hive, a way out. 



The invasion was commercial. The 
discovery confirmed Hellstrom’s 
instincts about Hive-learning. 
The lab would have to be told im- 
mediately. This might even help 
the Hive scientists in their own re- 
searches. The wild Outsiders some- 
times came up with rare insights. 
“Have I helped?” Fancy asked. 
“Indeed you have.” 

Saldo had stopped for a few 
words with one of the observers at 
the bank of instruments. He 
glanced across at Hellstrom, shook 
his head. Peruge was not yet on his 
way, then. Saldo had been 
instructed to give word at the first 
sign of Peruge. Hellstrom wanted 
Peruge to come now. 

Metallurgy? Inventions? All of 
those mysterious allusions by Pe- 
ruge now made sense — a re- 
markable degree of sense. 

Fancy still stood at the desk 
watching Hellstrom. 

“Did Peruge say anything else?” 
Hellstrom asked. 

“No.” She shook her head. 
“Nothing about the agency that 
sent him, the government agency?” 
“Well, he did say something 
about somebody named Chief. He 
hates Chief. He cursed horribly.” 
“You have helped enormously,” 
Hellstrom said, “but you must go 
into hiding now.” 

“Hiding?” 

“Yes. You’ve helped in many 
ways. I don’t even mind any longer 
that you stole Hive stores. You’ve 
reminded us that we share the same 
body chemistry with Outsiders. 
We’ve changed somewhat in three 
hundred years, of course, because 
we’ve bred for change, but — ” He 
gave her a brilliant smile. “Fancy, 



152 



GALAXY 




you must do nothing else now 
without consulting us.” 

“I won’t. I really won’t.” 

“Very good. Was Mirneca one of 
the breeder females you shared this 
little trick with?” 

“Yes.” 

“Excellent. I want you — ” He 
hesitated, taking in her pale face, 
the expectant expression. “Is there 
any chance that last night’s esca- 
pade was successful, that you’re im- 
pregnated?” 

“A very good chance.” She 
brightened. “I’m right at peak fer- 
tility. I’ve become pretty good at 
judging it.” 

“See if the gestation lab can con- 
firm that,” he said. “If test results 
are positive your period of hiding 
should be pleasant enough. If 
you’ve been impregnated, turn 
yourself in at Worker Gestation 
Prime. Tell them it’s at my instruc- 
tions. Don’t go on dormancy, 
though, until we’ve sent someone 
down to interrogate you on your 
use of breeder-hyp with Outsiders.” 

“I won’t. Nils. I’ll go down to the 
lab right away.” 

She turned, hurried across the 
chamber. Several workers looked 
up at her passage. She probably 
still trailed some of the hyp. 
Hellstrom had been too busy to 
notice. She was really a ridiculous 
female, he thought. What had they 
bred in this Fancy line? 

Saldo approached Hellstrom’s al- 
cove, looking back at Fancy until 
she had left the chamber. 

Hellstrom rubbed his chin. He 
kept himself on hair suppressants 
during most of his Hive days, but 
the beard insisted on growing 
anyway. He needed a shave and 



would have to get one before 
meeting Peruge. Appearance was 
important with Outsiders. 

So it was metallurgy and inven- 
tions, was it? 

As Saldo stopped just inside the 
alcove, Hellstrom asked absently; 
“What do you want?” 

“I listened while you were talking 
to Fancy,” Saldo said. 

“You heard what she said about 
Peruge?” 

“Yes.” 

“Do you still think you were at 
fault in letting her out of the Hive?” 
Hellstrom asked. 

“I — ” Saldo shrugged. 

“It was the Hive working things 
out in spite of us,” Hellstrom said. 
“The whole Hive can react as a 
single organism or it can react deli- 
cately through any one of us. Re- 
member that.” 

“If you say so,” Saldo said. He 
didn’t sound as though he believed 
this, however. 

“I say so. Oh, and when you in- 
terrogate Fancy I want you to be 
gentle with her.” 

“Gentle? She endangered the — ” 

“She did not. She gave us our es- 
cape hatch. You will be gentle with 
her. And with the other females, 
too — the ones she names.” 

“Yes, Nils.” Saldo felt that these 
orders went against reason, but he 
could not bring himself to outright 
disobedience of the Prime Male. 

Hellstrom stood up, moved 
around the desk and headed out of 
the chamber. 

“Will you be in your cell if I need 
you?” Saldo asked. 

“Yes. Have me called the instant 
Peruge is sighted.”

S TAND out to sea, south of San 
Francisco, and look at the 
coast. It requires little imagination 
to visualize a gigantic beast out of 
the remote past rising from the 
shallows, trying to draw himself 
ashore. Your mind can see him 
strain, imagine his anguish as he 
fails and slips protestingly back 
into the sea, leaving great gouges in 
the land. The sea, the eternal 
healer, does her best to repair the 
damage, to fill the gouges, and thus 
are born the beaches. Cup-shaped, 
they pock the coast from San 
Francisco to Monterey in numbers 
beyond counting. Some, large and 
crowded, bear names like Thorntor, 
Half Moon, Pomponio, Butano. 
Others, small and hidden from the 
casual traveler by rugged bluffs and 
dense chaparral, have no names. 

At the north end of one such 
nameless beach the rugged shoulder 
of a brush-covered bluff plummets 
precipitously into the sea. At the 
south end a jumble of monolithic 
rock mutely accepts the eternal on- 
slaught of the surf. The highway is 



far above the sand, unseen, its traf- 
fic unheard. Far out to sea a 
gleaming white sail slides north. It 
will stay out to sea. Seen from its 
deck, this tiny beach is insignifi- 
cant. From this beach, for two 
people newly married and much in 
love, the sail and rest of the world, 
ignored and ignoring, are equally 
insignificant. 

Vaughn Harding awoke slowly, 
savoring the delicious warmth of 
the sun in his face, the yielding sand 
beneath him, the gentle, irregular 
crashing of the surf. Race you to 
the water, Carol, he said sleepily. 
His words echoed flatly, a dull 
metal sound. He listened uncer- 
tainly to the ragged surging of the 
surf and a gentle coldness gripped 
his gut. Softly, he said, Carol? and 
opened his eyes. 

The coldness in his belly 
tightened. Brows knotted in 
concentration, Harding blinked 
rapidly to clear the red haze before 
him. Comprehension hovered mad- 
deningly out of reach, taunting him 
with small, disconnected bits of 
understanding. Images, infuriat- 
ingly dreamlike, floated through 
his awareness. The beach ... a 
walk with Carol . down the hill, 
through . but Carol . 

Harding groaned and tried to sit 
up. Agony lanced like a hot knife 
through his left wrist, arm, 
shoulder. Before he could utter a 
cry blackness engulfed him. 

They sat together and watched

the sun slip beneath the horizon, 
watched the gathering of darkness. 
At length he touched her auburn 
hair with his lips and said, C’mon, 
honey, let’s get up before it’s too 
dark to see. She remained silent 
and he sat enveloped in the fra- 
grance of her hair. Carol? he said 
softly. 

She drew away, turned to face 
him. Her eyes shimmeringly 
reflected the lingeringly bright ho- 
rizon. He folded her in his arms and 
felt her tears on his shoulder. 

Darling, he said soothingly, I 
thought we were all through with 
this — I thought you promised no 
more tears. 

I’m sorry, Vaughn. But I’m 
scared. It seems like such a long 
time and I’m afraid you won’t come 
back. I wish you wouldn’t go. 

Honey, don’t be like this — there 
isn’t anything to worry about. He 
gripped her shoulders and looked 
intently into her eyes. I promise 
you, Carol, I’ll quit as soon as I get 
back. We’ll have the rest of our 
lives together and thirty thousand 
Federation credits a year for 
retirement pay. Three months 
seems like an awfully small price to 
pay for that, doesn’t it? 

She blurted: No amount of 

money is worth your not coming 
back. They wouldn’t pay you that 
much if it weren’t so dangerous! 

He said firmly, a touch of exas- 
peration in his voice. It is not dan- 
gerous — it’s a perfectly safe 
assignment. They pay as they do 



because that’s how it is on the 
books. When the Charter was es- 
tablished this was a dangerous job, 
but that was two hundred years 
ago. The job’s changed, honey, but 
the Charter hasn’t — you know the 
Federation never changes anything 
it doesn’t have to. This deal is a 
give-away — I sit on my duff and 
collect hazard pay for doing a job 
that hasn’t seen a hazard for two 
hundred years! And then I’ll be 
home again. 

She looked at the darkening 
horizon for a long time before 
she murmured. Three months, 
Vaughn . 

G radually the comfortable, 

drowsy warmth that enfolded 
Harding like a blanket was 
disturbed by a throbbing in his arm. 
Slowly the cottony emptiness in his 
mind was displaced by hints and 
traces of memories, mocking at 
first, then disjointedly comprehen- 
sible. 

. terrestrial, of course, said 
Senator Williams dryly. The joke 
was standard and had long since 
been divested of whatever humor it 
had once possessed. Even in the 
small corner of the galaxy that had 
become familiar there were so 
many satellites orbiting so many 
planets that unless given a plan- 
etary referent the term “month” 
was meaningless. Such definition 
did not exist in the Charter, 
however — a condition out of which 
inevitably grew the horror story 



156 



GALAXY 




about the man (nobody could re- 
member his name) assigned to a 
planet (exactly which one escaped 
the teller’s memory at the moment) 
for a standard three-month tenure 
who, after spending seventy-six 
Earth-standard years there, had 
“only two months to go.” The 
story, rolled out in grim seriousness 
to wide-eyed recruits whose gulli- 
bility lay not in believing it, but in 
thinking they were supposed to, 
predictably gave rise to the question 
asked with profound sincerity and 
tongue scarcely noticeably in 
cheek. That is three months terres- 
trial, isn’t it, sir? 

Harding suppressed a dutiful 
chuckle. 

The Senator, satisfied, went on 
candidly: Damnably silly anyway 
— if you ask me. 

Sir? 

Oh, you know. All this garbage 
about a three-month habitation. He 
stared popeyed at Harding, who 
stirred uncomfortably in his chair 
and said nothing. You needn’t 
worry, Harding. I’m not going to 
jerk your soft retirement out from 
under you. I just think it’s a terrible 
waste of Federation resources — a 
pointless expenditure of money that 
could well be put to more humani- 
tarian projects. The continued ex- 
ploration under the Charter, the 
maintenance of a Corps of 
Volunteers — the whole thing is a 
shining monument to the empty- 
headed imbecility of the Congress. 

Harding fidgeted under Wil- 



liams’ glare and said uncertainly, 
/ don’t understand why you feel 
the way you do. 

Williams waved impatiently. You 
can’t figure out why Tm on the 
Committee, is that it? Simply a 
concession to the Humanist 
party — I was appointed. And / 
must admit that when / was ap- 
pointed I didn’t feel this way. But 
I’ve learned a lot since then. I’ve 
changed my views a great deal, 
which is of some embarrassment to 
my colleagues, as it appears that 
Senators on this Committee are 
supposed to remain inflexibly 
prejudice. Look — he stabbed a 
thick finger at Harding — in the first 
place it’s asinine to have the whole 
operation of Charter activities 
directed by a Senate committee. 
What do we know about space 
flight, about stellar navigation and 
celestial mechanics and the rest of 
it? Nothing! We have to assemble a 
huge staff of military experts to run 
things for us. But do we turn the 
Charter operations over to them, as 
we logically should? We do not! 
The Charter Committee provides 
too good a featherbed for too many 
rhetorically minded Senators who, 
without it, might have to go to 
work. So the Committee remains to 
waste money and have patriotic 
platitudes mouthed about it. 

But the political aspects, sir, 
began Harding. What about — 

Hah! erupted Williams. Political 
aspects! What political aspects? 
Look — two hundred years ago we

had taken our first trembling steps 
into the universe. We had a fairly 
large permanent colony on the 
moon. We had a ten-man scientific 
mission on Mars. We had made the 
first manned landing on Venus. We 
found traces of organic material on 
the moon. We found fungus on 
Mars. Fungus! We found more or- 
ganic matter on Venus. We’d found 
life or its presumed traces on three 
bodies in the solar system, not to 
mention the generally accepted 
existence of intelligent life on our 
own planet. The Federation drew in 
its skirts and decided that the odds 
overwhelmingly favored our en- 
countering other intelligent life in 
the galaxy. So they did two things. 
They extablished the Charter, pri- 
marily to assure that we included in 
the Federation no planet already 
claimed by another civilization. 
That we did not was checked out by 
the three-month residency re- 
quirement — if no supermen from 
out there showed up in the three- 
month period we stayed on a planet 
it was assumed to be unclaimed by 
anyone else. Next they established 
the Charter Committee to be the 
Federation representatives in the 
event that we did encounter another 
sapient race. There are your po- 
litical aspects! What do you think 
of them? 

Harding smiled weakly. Well, it 
all seems logical to me. sir. 

Logical? fumed the Senator. 
Logical? What’s happened since the 
Charter was established, Harding? 



What’s been the history of the 
Charter operations? 

I — ah. I don’t know too much — 

Of course you don’t! It’s 
classified — all classified! If it 
weren’t, if the public knew any- 
thing about it. the whole charade 
would collapse. Harding — Williams 
thumped the desk with a meaty fist 
to emphasize his words — we have 
discovered, inhabited and incor- 
porated into the Federation more 
than forty-three hundred planets. 
Among all forty-three hundred of 
those planets, do you know on how 
many we have encountered life? 
Seven! Seven planets — and I use 
the term “life” loosely. We have 
discovered a fungus on three of 
those seven, a bacterial form on two 
others and traces of organic com- 
pounds on the two remaining. 
Where are the mighty civilizations 
this Committee is preparing to deal 
with? Where is the super-race from 
beyond the galaxy whom we dare 
not offend by claiming territorial 
rights to one of their planets? 
Fungus! I fully expect that we shall 
some day encounter a mighty star- 
ship being flown across the breadth 
of the galaxy by a highly intelligent, 
sapient mushroom! Fungus! Good 
God, Harding, if there is other in- 
telligent life out there it’s so damn 
thinly spread out that we won’t find 
it in a million years. This whole 
Committee with its petty require- 
ments is eminently stupid. Most of 
the members know it, although they 
won’t admit it. And what’s more, 



158 



GALAXY 




they knew it fifty years ago, during 
the credit panic. If the Committee 
had been abolished then, savings 
to the Federation would have been 
incalculable. But did they abolish 
it? Hell, no — it would have cosfem 
their precious goldbricking jobs. 
Instead, with a great show of pious 
concern for the economy of the 
Federation, they reduced from fifty 
to one the number of men required 
to inhabit a planet prior to its incor- 
poration into the Federation. 
Habitation, they decided with un- 
dertakers’ solemnity, might reason- 
ably be performed within the 
intent of the Charter by a single in- 
dividual. Those self-serving bas- 
tards! Not only did they keep their 
soft jobs, but they implied to the 
credulous public that they were 
saving untold amounts of money. 
And every last one of those men 
knew perfectly well that it’s damn 
near as expensive to send one man a 
half-billion light-years out there as 
it is to send a hundred. It’s not how 
many you send, it’s the getting 
there that’s so damn expensive. 

Harding sat silent for a few mo- 
ments, then cleared his throat un- 
comfortably. If, ah, that’s all, sir — 

Yes, Harding, that’s all, said 
Williams wearily. / hope my 
outburst didn’t upset you. I get to 
brooding about my esteemed 
colleagues at times — he made a 
grim face — and it just pours out, 
like diarrhea. 

Williams stood abruptly. Well, 
that’s it, then, he said briskly. 



You’ll be on the Nebula, Captain 
Holcombe commanding. Shuttle 
lift at oh-three-hundred tomorrow, 
slip twenty-seven. You can look 
forward to three months of relaxa- 
tion or meditation or whatever you 
fellows do out there. Good luck, 
Harding. Enjoy yourself. 

Harding shook the proffered 
hand and turned to leave. At the 
door he hesitated and said. Ah, 
Senator, there is one thing I’d like 
to make sure of before I go. 

Yes, Harding? What’s that? 

Well, I want to be sure that if 
I — that is, if anything happens, my 
wife will — ah, my pension — 

It’s all taken care of, said 
Williams gently. She’ll get it all. 
You needn’t worry, though — 
nothing ever happens on these 
jaunts. I’d forgotten about your 
marrying until just now. What’s 
her name again? 

Carol, sir; her name is Carol. 

Her name is Carol. 

Her name is Carol. 

Her name is Carol. 

Her name. 

C AROL. God, how his arm 
hurt. Harding grimaced and 
very carefully sat upright. He 
pawed briefly at his faceplate and 
realized he could do nothing about 
the red haze before him. 

“Blood,” he muttered, the taste 
of it thick in his mouth. “You dumb 
slob. Stupid!” 

He heaved a disgusted sigh and 
winced at the fire in his arm.

159 




Slowly, painfully, he began to 
struggle to his feet. The agony was 
fierce — dizziness and nausea now 
washed over him in waves. Finally 
he stood, feet planted wide apart, 
eyes open and staring. He found 
that by cocking back his head he 
could see dimly through the rela- 
tively clear upper portion of the 
faceplate. He gazed at the undu- 
lating wall of sand before him and 
waited for the urge to vomit to sub- 
side. 

What a dumb thing to do, he 
thought. What a dumb, stupid, 
rookie stunt. No, not even a rookie 
stunt. Any average rookie would 
have been too smart — or too scared, 
more likely — to go traipsing off 
across the country. But not Dumb 
Harding. No, old Dumb Harding, 
lacking even the sense God gave 
goats, had left the pressure dome 
and gone for a walk. Harding 
snorted at his folly. He had headed 
toward the dunes that were the only 
feature marring the otherwise 
perfect flatness of the plateau. They 
had been only about five kilometers 
distant and he had reached them 
with ease. He had wound his way 
through them, had come abruptly 
to the rift and stopped before it, 
feeling a tingle of excitement. The 
rift was not on the map so carefully 
prepared for him or on any of the 
photographs used to prepare it. 

He had gone to within three or 
four meters of the edge and stared 
down expectantly. The possibility 
that he, Vaughn Harding, might 



confound Senator Williams and 
find intelligent life had been strong 
in his mind. His hope had been 
quickly quenched. Nothing had 
seemed unusual about the rift — it 
had simply been there, oyerlooked 
by photographers, unrepresented 
on the map. 

The sound of the slide had carried 
faintly to him in the thin at- 
mosphere and perhaps three 
seconds had passed before he had 
realized what was taking place. He 
had shouted “Look out!” to no- 
body and had started back pedaling 
frantically. He had not been fast 
enough. The collapsing rim of the 
rift had reached out toward him 
and he had suddenly tumbled, 
cartwheeled, plummeted down the 
steep side. He remembered a stun- 
ning impact as his body, weighing 
half again its Earth-normal 180 
pounds had hit something solid, a 
momentary sensation of weight- 
lessness, another crunching impact 
all but overshadowed by a violent, 
red-rimmed burst of pain. Then 
blackness and dreams, warm and 
fragrant with Carol. 

His nausea subsided somewhat, 
and slowly Harding fished about in 
the voluminous pocket on his right 
leg. He withdrew a long nylon strap 
with aluminum clips on each end. 
Cautiously he wound it about his 
damaged left arm and his waist, 
eventually succeeding in immo- 
bilizing the arm. It was dreadfully 
uncomfortable, but would keep the 
arm from hampering him too

much. That done, he took a few ex- 
perimental steps through the sand. 
As he did so, the gently insistent 
hissing that in his dream had been 
the surf intruded itself on his con- 
sciousness. He cocked his head 
back and looked up. The top of the 
rift was almost lost in blowing, 
swirling sand. After an open- 
mouthed moment, he said 
passionately, “You son of a bitch! 
You goddam son of a bitching 
wind!” This place, he thought bit- 
terly, was full of surprises — first the 
rift, now the wind. 

H ARDING’S landing on the 
planet had been routine to the 
point of boredom. Except for the 
barren, sandy landscape outside the 
viewports he might have been in the 
Link back at Vandenburg. Not 
until the four contact lights glowed 
bright green could he be sure he was 
down. He put the power switches in 
the auto position, pulled the bus bar 
and reached for the radio. 

Contact positive, landing affirm- 
ative. The natives of Kalahari II 
are rushing out with large signs 
saying “Earthling, go home.” I 
think I see a camel over there — or 
maybe it’s a hamburger stand. 

Very funny, Harding. Kalahari 
1 1, for God’s sake. 

Holcombe, you have the vivid 
imagination of a rather dull toad. If 
you think I’m going to spend three 
months on this slagheap and call it 
KSC 3885 F, guess again. What 
would you call it, with all this sand? 



Never mind, never mind — I know 
what you’d call it: KSC 3885 F. 
Thank God you jug jockeys aren’t 
the only people in the universe. I 
couldn’t stand it. 

Why, thank you, Vaughn, said 
Holcombe sweetly, you are lucky to 
know me, only I didn’t think you 
realized it. Why don’t you build 
your house, worm, so we can take 
our offensive presence from your 
vicinity and live in peace for three 
months? 

Harding chuckled. Holcombe 
was twice his age and minus a leg, 
but he was damn good company. 
He would be missed. Quickly 
Harding scanned the gauges on the 
small instrument panel and, satis- 
fied that the tiny ship was stable, 
opened the lock and engaged the 
short ladder. The ship was not 
pressurized — oxygen was too 
precious a commodity to be vented 
indiscriminately into space. 
Harding had donned his suit in the 
transport, and the oxygen in the 
small ship had been purged into the 
bigger one. No waste. 

On the sandy surface Harding 
busied himself with the dome 
package. The push of a stud on the 
exterior of the little ship activated 
explosive bolts on the opposite side 
and three large panels flew away 
into the sand. From the exposed 
portion, like a large, gleaming 
spider, the ribs of the dome began 
to unfold. As they reached their 
farthest extension the panels 
between them popped into 



REFLEX 



161 




place — soon the apparition took on 
the regular aspect of a shining 
hemisphere with the ship hanging 
on one side like a misshapen appen- 
dage. Harding walked slowly 
around the dome, inspecting it care- 
fully. Satisfied with its appearance, 
he returned to the ship and pressed 
a second stud. The reports from 
four more explosive bolts sounded 
thinly in the alien atmosphere and 
the ship began to move. Electric 
motors whined and gears meshed 
and the center portion of the ship 
containing the instruments and 
engine rose on struts. The lower 
portion, containing the airlock and 
stores, settled squatly on the sand, 
its landing struts folding up like the 
legs of a grasshopper. 

As it came to rest something 
caught Harding’s eye. 

Hey, Holcombe, the wind's 
blowing. Faint swirls and eddies of 
sand drifted around his ankles. 

Right, Harding, returned Hol- 
combe laconically. Don’t it always 
blow on Thursday? 

This is on the level. Holcombe. 
It’s blowing the sand around down 
here. Harding sounded tense. 

You sure it’s not your 
imagination? 

Damn it, Holcombe — 

Okay, okay, take it easy. There 
is an atmosphere , you know. You 
probably just stirred it up a bit with 
your landing. First convection that 
place has seen in a million years. 
You know what the weather boys 
said — no meteorological hazards. 



Easy enough for you to say. all 
nice and snug up there, said 
Harding. In the silence between 
words he could hear the faint 
murmur of sand against his suit. 

Relax, friend. It’ll be gone before 
I get around again. Think you can 
stop peeping under the bed. 
Granny, and get the ship ready to 
go? Holcombe sounded faintly 
amused. 

Go to hell. Pop, snorted Harding. 
Give me a mark. 

Yes. sir, said Holcombe, mealy- 
mouthed. Coming up on one 
hundred minutes — mark! Got it? 
His voice faded rapidly as the 
transport’s orbit carried it toward 
the horizon. 

Got it, affirmed Harding, If 
you’ll get off the horn I have work 
to do. See you later. 

See ya. came Holcombe’s faint 
voice. Harding looked down at his 
feet and watched the sand drift 
gently over them. No meteoro- 
logical hazards, he thought. No cli- 
mate. A dead planet. Resolutely he 
turned to the dome. 

The lower portion of the ship 
formed the airlock for the dome. 
He activated both the inner and the 
outer doors twice and, satisfied that 
they worked freely, closed them 
and began sealing the gasket 
between the lock and the dome. 

One hundred minutes later the 
tiny instrument package leaped off 
the struts to rejoin the transport — it 
would be reused countless times on 
future landings. The struts re-

mained behind, a tower bearing 
radio antennae. Inside the dome 
Harding listened to the diminishing 
squeal of the rocket motor and was 
alone. 

Holcombe’s voice came over a 
speaker. Locked on and tracking. 
Good shot, Harding. You all set 
down there? 

Roger, roger. Snug as hell. 
Airtight, warm — and this place is 
almost big enough to stand up in. 
Couldn’t ask for more, he said, 
thinking wistfully of Carol. 

Beautiful, said Holcombe. What 
about your hurricane? 

Harding had forgotten about it in 
his rush to secure the dome. He 
looked carefully through the 
window and said, No wind. Not a 
breath. 

Told ya. 

Damn know-it-all. You make me 
sick. 

Now, Harding, that’s not nice. I 
might just forget to come back for 
you. 

And miss my peerless company 
going home? I doubt it. 

I guess you’re right, said 
Holcombe slowly. This ship ain’t 
the same without its mascot. See 
you in three months, Vaughn. 

Terrestrial? 

Ha-ha. Enjoy yourself . 

Thanks, Holcombe. See you 
later. Holcombe made no reply and 
Harding shut off the radio. He 
looked again through the window at 
the sandy plain. No wind. No me- 
teorological hazards. 



H arding gazed up at the 
sand-swirled wedge of sky 
above the rift and turned the non- 
sense syllables over and over in his 
mind, giving them a singsong qual- 
ity. No meterorological hazards — 
no meteorological hazards. He 
shook his head to clear his 
thoughts and immediately regretted 
doing so as pain flared cruelly 
through his arm. Carefully he 
arched his good arm high into 
the air and peered over the blood- 
wash on his faceplate. The elapsed- 
time gauge on his wrist was barely 
visible — three hours gone, four left. 
He lowered his arm slowly, gazed 
up the side of the rift and felt a 
surge of frightened anger at him- 
self, at Holcombe for bringing him 
here, at the Federation and its 
Charter. Favoring his damaged 
arm, he walked to the steep slof)e 
and started to climb. 

The ascent was an opus in an- 
guish. The loose sand slipped and 
sighed away beneath his feet, rob- 
bing him of two meters for each 
three he climbed. Periodically he 
went to his knees — only the excru- 
ciating jarring of his arm kept him 
from sinking into an exhausted 
faint. His legs ached, throbbed with 
overexertion and oxygen star- 
vation. He stopped once to rest and 
began to slide inexorably back into 
the depths of the rift. After that he 
was afraid to stop again. 

Through it all the wind whipped 
sand down over the edge above him, 
piling it up against the front of his 



REFLEX 



163 




suit as fast, almost, as he could 
push through it. Slowly the 
grinding sand etched the smooth 
faceplate, lacing it with myriad tiny 
scratches, each insignificant alone, 
but in combination sufficient 
further to reduce his vision. He 
sweated heavily and the mixture of 
perspiration and blood ran down 
his collar, irritating him in- 
tolerably. 

And still he climbed — step, step, 
step. His legs felt bathed in 
fire — they trembled uncontrollably. 
Only by putting his good hand on 
each leg in turn and leaning for- 
ward could he lock his knees — he 
no longer had the strength to do it 
otherwise. He sobbed in pain — his 
arm throbbed almost audibly. 
Centimeter by centimeter he made 
his uncertain way upward. After a 
seeming eternity of pain- 
punctuated frustration his shaking 
legs deserted him — he stumbled 
and fell forward. The impact of his 
fall elicited a yell of pain and disap- 
pointment. Gradually it came to 
him that he was not sliding back 
into the rift. He lay listening to the 
sand whisper against his helmet and 
slowly realized that he was out, that 
he was on level ground above the 
rift. Hard on the heels of that 
awareness came the recollection of 
his fall into the rift, of the 
collapsing rim reaching out for him 
and dragging him down in an 
avalanche of sand. Strength he 
didn’t know he possessed flooded 
him and he was on his feet, running. 



stumbling, lurching on wobbly legs 
away from the rift. With each step 
his knees threatened to buckle and 
pitch him into the sand. With each 
step the pain in his arm blazed high, 
and long before it ebbed came 
another jarring step, another lance 
of pain. In a mounting crescendo 
the pain rose higher and higher 
until his whole universe consisted of 
hurt, jarring, thudding, unremitting 
agony. With a great, blinding crash 
the pain reached an impossible 
peak and was no more. 

T he peaceful blue serenity of 
the ocean off the California 
coast belies its occasionally 
treacherous nature. Where tiny 
beaches pockmork the coast the 
current follows the shoreline, 
burying a deadly riptide just be- 
neath the innocent-looking surface 
of the sea. There is an axiom for 
those who swim where the riptides 
lurk; if caught by the rip — don’t 
fight it. Ride with it. Conserve your 
strength and eventually the tide will 
bring you close to shore and safety. 
It is an axiom suitable for quo- 
tation by those who venture to 
ankle- or knee-depth — an axiom 
espoused by those who remain in 
the shaded safety of their huge um- 
brellas. To one caught in the rip, 
helplessly treading water and 
watching the beach recede rapidly 
until the people are mere dots 
against the white sand, it is an 
axiom all too easily forgotten. In 
the grip of panic one swims re- 



164 



GALAXY 




flexively, striving for shore without 
thought, realizing only too late that 
he strives in vain. 

Harding knew he was drowning. 
He struggled feebly, knowing his 
struggle was almost over. Distantly 
he promised himself that if ever 
again he was caught in a rip. But 
that, of course, was pointless. There 
would be no more rips — this was his 
last swim. He felt vaguely apolo- 
getic, aware that Carol would be 
upset and embarrassed by his igno- 
minious death. His reflexes over- 
rode his willpower and he took a 
salt unwilling gasp of seawater. 
He could hear the approaching 
surf, and wondered dimly if he 
would survive long enough to be 
pounded to jelly on the rocks — he 
had not the strength to fight the 
slamming surf. He took another 
deep, reflexive breath of the sea — it 
forcefully expelled itself and his 
body demanded that he draw 
another and another and. 

^ ^ TESUS,” he muttered. Reach- 
ing up behind his helmet, 
he opened the valve on the reserve 
oxygen tank and lay breathing 
deeply of the cool, fresh air. 
Reserve tank, he thought — that 
meant two hours left. Two hours. 
But he was out of the rift now and it 
was level ground all the way to the 
dome. When finally his breathing 
returned to normal he rose gingerly 
to his feet, wary and distrustful of 
his shuddering legs. He tightened 
the cinch on his arm, grunting in 



pain as he did so, and activated the 
receiver in his helmet. From the 
earphones came the musical ping- 
ping, ping-ping of the homer. 
Harding muttered, “Damnation!” 
and, turning forty-five degrees to 
his left, began to march unsteadily 
through the blowing sand. Once he 
stopped and peered ahead, cocking 
back his head. Nothing. His visi- 
bility was reduced to fifty meter by 
the obscured faceplate and the 
blowing sand. Resolutely he plod- 
ded on. 

The homer was a simple device, a 
relic of the days that saw atmos- 
pheric aircraft on Earth flown by 
fallible, human pilots. It sent out a 
tight-beam radio signal in a preset 
direction — the classic Morse code 
for the letter A: ping-beep, ping- 
beep. To one side of the A band was 
the I band: ping-ping, ping-ping. To 
the other side was the M band: 
beep-beep, beep-beep. As long as 
one’s earphones played the 
comforting song of the A band one 
moved in a straight line which, if 
extended, would end at the dome. 
If, instead, one heard the 
distressing sound of either the / or 
M bands it was a simple matter to 
move right or left and find the A 
band and the route to safety. 

Harding moved on into the wind, 
stopping now and then to peer 
around. When finally he found the 
A band he turned reflexively to his 
right and followed it. The seductive 
hissing of the wind-blown sand 
against his suit filled his mind with 



REFLEX 



165 




images: now a kitchen faucet run- 
ning, splashing water into an empty 
sink; now a panful of bacon, savory 
and sizzling. Most often it was the 
sea — sometimes pulling out over 
the rocks at Moss Beach as he and 
Carol dashed among the tidepools 
searching for starfish; sometimes 
smashing against the jetty at Long 
Beach as he leaned against a huge 
rock and watched Carol move 
gracefully along the breakwater; 
sometimes surging sluggishly over 
the white sands below Pescadero, 
where Carol lay waiting for him on 
a blanket before a guttering 
campfire. Harding often fished the 
surf and cooked his catch over such 
a private campfire. Carol started 
and tended the blaze while he 
fished. She would wait for him, a 
little higher up the beach, out of the 
wind. He could hear snatches of a 
rhythmic song from her portable 
radio, so she couldn’t be too far 
away. Just up ahead, probably — 
just beyond . 

W ITH profound surprise 
Harding realized that he had 
stopped walking and was standing 
still, searching helplessly for Carol. 
“Idiot!” he raged. “You goddam 
idiot!” He plunged ahead angrily, 
cursing himself for a fool. Each step 
he took jarred his arm painfully and 
he grunted in response. He devoted 
his consciousness singlemindedly to 
the sequence of step, grunt, step, 
grunt. He heard the homer dis- 
tantly, responded to its varied song 



reflexively, by tropism. Once more 
he stopped and looked about, but 
could see nothing. The scouring 
sand had finished the job the blood 
had started. His faceplate was 
dimly translucent, like a washroom 
window. He sighed and moved on. 

Step, grunt, step, grunt. Occa- 
sionally his awareness rose a bit 
and he mused about the time 
remaining to him. That he was run- 
ning low on oxygen was ob- 
vious — his breathing was deeper 
than it should have been. He was 
taking one great gasp with each 
step. Concentration on anything 
but the sequence of step and grunt, 
however, was more than he could 
handle — concern about his air re- 
mained too distant to coalesce into 
fear. 

A dark, bewildering cloud of un- 
certainty settled on his mind. 
Where was he going? He heard a 
noise and, devoting his attention to 
it, recognized it with pride as the 
homer. He stepped forward and the 
sound of the A band abruptly 
changed to that of the M band. 
Frowning, confused, he turned to 
his right and took another step and 
found himself almost immediately 
listening to the ping-ping of the I 
band. Panting heavily, he sought 
and found the A band again and, by 
moving his head from side to side, 
defined its width as about a half- 
meter. A half-meter — that meant 
he was about a hundred meters 
from the dome. Sucking deeply of 
the foul air in his suit, he lined him- 



166 



GALAXY 




self up carefully with the A band 
and stepped forward. Only a 
hundred meters, he thought. 
Slowly, punctuated by great gasps, 
a smile of congratulation began to 
spread across his face — and froze in 
a horrified grimace before it came 
to full flower. 

The homer fell silent. 

“Hey!” He panted, listening. 
There was no sound save the 
mirthless chuckle of the sand 
against his suit. “Damn it,” he 
yelled weakly, “don’t — don’t quit 
now!” The sand thrummed in his 
ears. He resisted an urge to run and 
spoke more calmly to himself. 
“Now wait a minute — ^just — wait. 
It’s only a hundred meters 
away — not more than a hundred 
meters.” He started to turn around, 
but thought better of it. If his foot- 
prints were still there he couldn’t 
see to line up on them. Squaring his 
shoulders, he stepped deliberately 
ahead, counting steps. 

Two steps to the meter in the 
bulky suit — two hundred steps to a 
hundred meters. Better make it 
two-twenty, he thought, re- 
membering the sand that robbed 
him of strength and his steps of 
distance. He tried counting aloud, 
but the effort of breathing soon be- 
came too great. He was breathing 
twice to each step, two great, 
rasping gasps that made his ribs 
and belly ache. He plodded groggily 
ahead, trying desperately not to 
lose count. 

A shock of pain roused him and 



he realized he had fallen. Vaguely 
he knew that was bad; knew that 
for some reason he didn’t want to 
fall, knew that he had to stay on his 
feet. He was going somewhere, but 
the pounding of the surf in his ears 
made it difficult to remember 
where. He struggled slowly and 
grimly to his feet and his head 
cleared somewhat. “God — damn — 
sand — ” he panted, moving 
forward. Something tangled his 
foot and he fell heavily, a bright 
shaft of pain knifing through 
his dimming consciousness. She 
wouldn’t let him sleep. That was 
her one bad habit — she would not 
let him sleep. Whenever he wanted 
to sleep she would wake 
him — pinch him and wake him. He 
put out his arm to fend her off and 
touched something rigid, angular. 
Confused, he ran his hand over it 
and a dim realization bubbled into 
being. 

“The — the tower — ” he croaked. 
His field of view was a swimming 
red haze. Eyes forced wide open as 
if to penetrate the mistiness before 
him by sheer willpower, he climbed 
to his feet and felt his way along the 
tower. At the end of it he came to 
something solid, looming darkly 
before him. He felt his way along it, 
unseeing, searching for something. 
He knew he should remember this 
object, this thing before him, and 
was impatient with himself for not 
recognizing it. It came to him 
slowly that it was a bluff above the 
beach and that Carol was at the 



REFLEX 



167 




top, waiting ... he had to find . 
there was a path . 

He collided with something jut- 
ting from the surface before him 
and accidentally found the 
oversized handle to the outer lock. 
That was it! She wasn’t at the 
top — she was inside! He pulled the 
handle and fell heavily to the floor. 
The lock closed automatically be- 
hind him and he crawled forward, 
conscious only of the shattering 
pain in his arm and of Carol. He 
pawed clumsily at the handle to the 
inner lock. Concepts of purging, of 
pressure equalization slipped slug- 
gishly through his mind, signifying 
nothing. Something had to happen 
before he could get in to Carol, but 
he couldn’t figure out what it was. 
While he puzzled over it the inner 
lock sprang open and he slumped 
inside. 

Vaughn? Is that you? 

“Carol — can’t — can’t breathe — ” 

Oh, Vaughn, you’re so silly. Of 
course you can’t breathe. You have 
your helmet on. 

“—can’t—” 

Vaughn, sweetheart, take off 
your helmet. Here, I’ll help 
you — we have to take it off before 
you can breathe. 

“Helmet — ” gasped Harding. 
Fingers fumbled at the catches — 
whose? Was Carol . she . 

He tore off the helmet. His chest 
heaved violently and the air caught 
in his throat. His wide-eyed, sur- 
prised gaze fastened not on Carol, 
but on a ragged gash in the dome. 



through which protruded one 
twisted leg of the fallen tower. For 
a tiny moment that merged imper- 
ceptibly with eternity, Harding felt 
horribly cheated. 

The sand, drifting through the 
gash, piled up slowly and gusted 
about the dome. A few grains set- 
tled, unfelt, on Harding’s glassy, 
staring eyes. 

Outside, the wind slackened. 

We feel that if there is a 
single criterion by which to 
define life it can only be the 
phenomenon of existence. A fly 
is alive and, after a fashion, 
aware. But does the fly recog- 
nize as living the horse he bites? 
For that matter, does the horse 
in crushing the fly recognize the 
fly as living? Or is the horse 
simply responding reflexively 
to a ‘non-living’ irritant? Our 
views of the phenomenon of 
life, gentlemen, are as those of 
the fly. We must broaden those 
views or, like the fly, we shall 
be doomed to live out our exis- 
tence in a universe at whose 
mercy we shall be through our 
failure to understand.

Here's what Robert S. Richardson has 
been good enough to tell this department 
about himself: 

Since earliest childhood, I was interested 
both in writing and in astronomy, a double 
obsession that continued into college. Unfortu- 
nately, I regarded neither profession as likely to 
produce what is known as a "good" living. I 
was absolutely right. 

When I tell people I was born in Kokomo, In- 
diana, they always give me that "what-a-bum- 
joke" look. But people are born in Kokomo. 
Soon after my birth, my parents moved to the 
Pacii'ic coast. They never went back. 

My wife won't let me disclose my age, since 
that would give a clue to her age I will say, 
however, that I have a distinct recollection of 
seeing Halley's Comet when it last returned in 
the spring of 1910. 

With some misgivings. I decided finally on 
a career in astronomy, toward which end I 
earned my Ph.D degree during seven years at 
UCLA and UC in Berkeley. Main achievement 
at UCLA was being the first man to break 10 
seconds in the 100-yard dash. Happiest 
recollection is the three weeks spent in UCLA 
hospital. Have no happy recollections of UC. 

I began writing, chiefly for monetary reasons, 
and had the misfortune to sell my first article to 
the old Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine. 

I say "misfortune" because the sale gave me 
the idea that writing was an easy source of in- 
come. I was speedily disillusioned. 

Immediately after receiving that Ph.D 
degree. I joined the staff of Mount Wilson Ob- 
servatory near Pasadena, specializing in the 
sun and planets. (This observatory, with its 
200-inch telescope on Mt. Palomar, is now 
operated jointly with Caltech as the Hale Ob- 
servatory.) After some 25 years of research 
there and elsewhere, I joined Griffith Observa- 
tory in Los Angeles as Associate Director. 
There, the urge to write became stronger in me 
than ever. Ultimately I decided to follow 
Nietzsche's dictum to "live dangerously" and 



voluntarily resigned to become a freelance 
writer at an age when most men are gloomily 
contemplating retirement. I have never re- 
gretted my decision. 

I have authored scores of articles and books 
on astronomy, besides short stories under the 
name Philip Latham, 



The idea for the GALAXY article in this issue 
came from dissatisfaction with the usual expla- 
nations for the Star of Bethlehem, the best 
being that the phenomenon was a nova. It oc- 
curred to me that it might be, rather, a recur- 
rent nova. Next question: is there a known 
recurrent nova which precession would put 
over the zenith of Bethlehem at the time of 
Christ? Investigation showed that the "blaze" 
star. T Coronae florea/Zs, fulfilled all conditions. 

Fortunately I was able to get the cooperation 
of Father Ronald E. Royer, a young priest at 
nearby St. Frances of Rome Church. Besides 
teaching. Father Royer has had a longtime 
interest in astronomy and boasts an excellent 
observatory with a telescope he made himself. 

My wife Marjorie and I live in the foothills 
below Mount Wilson in sight of the buildings 
where I used to observe the stars. We have a 
daughter, Rae — an art student at UCLA — and 
one grandchild, Jima, age 5, apparently 
concentrating on avant-garde art in kin- 
dergarten.

T hey come along far too 
seldom — these treasure boxes 
of carefully selected stories, studi- 
ously and carefully compiled, inter- 
leaved with commentary and analy- 
sis. Damon Knight used to do a 
lot of this; one wishes he would 
resume it. Willis McNelly is 
good at it, and Thomas Disch’s 
The Ruins of Earth, though it 
lacks the internal commentaries, 
is a shining example. Now we 
have Dr. Clareson’s A Spectrum 
of Worlds, a gem-dealer’s 
display, a laboratory analyst’s 
report and a kind of love-letter 
to the whole field, its origins, its 
nature and its significance. (I was 
going to write “purpose,” but 
wouldn’t that open a sack of 
snakes?) Dr. Clareson is a 
professor at Wooster in Ohio, 
and is the mainspring of the 
Science Fiction Research As- 



sociation — which seems to be de- 
veloping into a communications 
center for all facets of sf — and of 
its journal. Extrapolation. He 
edited a previous critical anthology 
{SF: The Other Side of Realism) 
and now gives us A Spectrum of 
Worlds. It’s a survey and study of 
various brands of sf from Henry 
Fielding to Anthony Burgess (in his 
introduction) and from Bierce 
(1893) to Silverberg (1969) in the 
table of contents. It’s a fine overview 
of the field for newcomer and old 
hand alike. I’m especially grateful 
for Jack London’s The Red One, 
which I happen not to have read be- 
fore, and 0,God, couldn’t that man 
write! Some of the stories are 
literary atrocities, but are there for 
good reason as the editor clearly 
points out. Here and there one 
might be abraded by Dr. C.’s 
schoolmasterish instructions as to

what to think of a story, and both 
the Aldiss specimen and Dr. Cla- 
reson’s comments on it remind me 
of the remark made by an ob- 
scurantist poet I just invented; “If 
you understand what I just said 
you have missed the point.” (I 
honor, admire, and sometimes envy 
Brian Aldiss, but every once in 
a while I wish he would go 
back to 1957 and his little super- 
man and start over. This is one of 
the times. Other times I bite 
my tongue for saying such things.) 
Still, I heartily recommend the 
book. 

“Can’t you understand that ro- 
manticism is no more an enemy of 
science than mysticism is? In fact, 
romanticism and science are good 
for one another. The scientist keeps 
the romantic honest and the ro- 
mantic keeps the scientist human.” 
Thus speaks Amanda, in Another 
Roadside Attraction, and if you 
want my feelings about sf, there 
they are. Ah, Amanda. How this 
unique, extraordinary, provocative 
beauty of a book has escaped really 
wide attention is, to me, a major 
mystery. I spend a great deal of 
time with books — never in my life 
can I recall spending it in a con- 
dition of such expansive delight as I 
have done with this one. Tom Rob- 
bins is one of the most vivid 
imagists, with one of the most out- 
rageous heads walking the world 



today. And if that sounds as if he is 
walking on his head, so be it — he 
certainly is walking on and in mine. 
Maybe I have no business even 
mentioning this book on these 
pages; perhaps you will feel conned 
because it isn’t hard-line sf. Well, 
it’s got scientists and a think-tank 
and a high-atmosphere balloon ex- 
periment with cosmic rays and 
solar energy. It also has literature’s 
most improbable kidnaping and a 
group of the most unusual 
characters and situations you will 
ever encounte^;j> Forget categories 
and fall into this book and enjoy. 
Enjoy. If you have a sense-of- 
wonder, this very sensuous book 
will fulfill it. 

L loyd biggle, jr.’s agent 

4 once transferred to him an 
editor’s request for “a Bigglish kind 
of story.” To judge by the 
collection The Metallic Muse, this 
means a readable, sometimes 
amusing, sometimes poignant story 
with a straight-line, unconvoluted 
plot. The yarns are often stitched 
with music — the author is a trained 
musician — and are usually con- 
structed around an idea or solu- 
tion withheld until the punchline. 
A valid technique, except where the 
reader gets to the punchline first. 
The one I liked best is Orphan of 
the Void. A pleasing package.

partial list of DAW books for this 
strophe. DAW is making it difficult 
for a reviewer to devote his space to 
anything else. Issuing four titles a 
month — anthologies, collections, 

original novels, all with the claim to 
first paperback — or even first 
book — publication, makes it high 
tide time. Anyway: The World 
Menders annoys me because of its 
virtues. Biggie works with one of 
the most provocative ideas ever to 
come up the pike: the definition of 
humanity itself. (This was superbly 
dealt with in a fine French novel by 
Vercors, called You Shall Know 
Them, long out of print. If you can 
lay hands on a copy, do.) Biggie has 
set up an engrossing problem in 
civilization and culture on the 
planet Branoff IV, where the more 
or less urban Rascz are 
served by the Olz, who do all the 
dirty work. Most Rascz have 
never seen an Ol; some 
seem never to have heard of them. 
The task of the secret Earth expe- 
dition is to bring democracy to 
Branoff — rather, to cause the in- 
habitants to bring democracy to 
themselves — but how do you do 
either when the Olz seem to have no 
self-respect, no sense of group 
identity, and the Rascz have no 
reason to believe that they should 
or even might? My irritation stems 
from the fact that nothing in this 
plot would work unless the be- 



havior of each of its components 
was precisely as stated — and I 
don’t think it would be. Liv- 
ing things — cultures or indi- 
viduals — are only statistically 

precise in their behavior, and the 
presence of one or two mildly wild 
talents anywhere in either group 
would make the whole thing im- 
possible. Irritation the second deals 
with the protagonist and his rela- 
tionship with the girl Liano, an 
Earth colleague — truly a lovely and 
compelling creation. Biggie did not 
develop this facet of his story. 
Professionally, she had answers for 
his hero’s problems, plenty of them, 
and if the man ever even asked for 
them, reader knoweth not. Finally, 
the axiom, the solemn credo of the 
whole book, is that democracy is 
good for all species on all planets at 
all times in all places. This thesis, 
viewed objectively even by as case- 
hardened a democracy-lover as 
myself, is as foolish as those 
Russian sf first-contact stories that 
judge the worth, and even decide 
the life or death, of alien cultures by 
whether or not they are socialist. 
All these seem like carps (a more 
highly evolved life form than the re- 
cidivistic sturgeon) and they have 
used up a lot of my space here — but 
what I want to get across is that 
they spring from the book’s virtues, 
and are sparked by a writer who is a 
comer.

RIEFLY then; Genius Un- 
limited springs from the 
literary loins of Hawk Garse and 
Doc Savage, complete with dead 
stops for lectures on gimmicks and 
this fall’s fashions in sexual ac- 
cessories. It’s a book to toss to 
hard-core of addicts who mourn 
that the good old days are forever 
gone. If this is your cookie, eat it 
and have fun. The Year’s Best Hor- 
ror Stories explodes one with nos- 
talgia for the long-mourned Weird 
Tales. Richard Davis has done a 
fine job of collecting horrors from a 
wide spectrum of sources here and 
in England and even one from the 
Spanish; the contents are over 80% 
excellent. Some, like the Spanish 
entry by Eddy Bertin, are re- 
planting of the familiar Gothic 
fields. Some, like the Matheson, 
are the skilled nightmares that start 
with shock and run all the way to 
ghastly, one or two, like Celia 
Fremlin’s A Quiet Game, are 
outstandingly original. A worthy 
package. Dean Koontz, in A 
Darkness in my Soul, seems to have 
had his novelistic womb badly 
frightened by Harlan Ellison, ’long 
about the second trimester. Into a 
fairly rigid near-future history (and 
fairly frightening, friends — could 
be he’s not far wrong) he injects a 
concept that completely fragments 
his flywheel. It takes a lot of unset- 
tling to make me mix metaphors 



that much. How is it that the more 
stupendous, colossal, cosmic an sf 
novel is, the more trivial it seems 
to be in retrospect? I think it’s be- 
cause that it-could-happen-to-ME 
element is abandoned and you can’t 
believe it any more, even for fun. 
Koontz would do well not to try 
stuff like this until he grows up to 
be Robert Silverberg. Suzette 
Elgin’s At the Seventh Level owes 
more to the richness and delicacy of 
its prose than to its structure, which 
again hangs on a single, not-too-ob- 
scure gimmick which, if revealed 
early, would have made the book 
unnecessary. However, she writes 
so beautifully that she would be 
worth reading even if she had far 
less to say than she has here. How 
she achieves her complex, stained- 
glass effects without approaching 
the precious or the “purple” fills 
me with awe. We Can Build You 
proves for all time that: 1) Philip K. 
Dick is overwhelmingly competent 
and capable and might — probably 
will — produce a major novel and 
that: 2) this isn’t it.. I base the first 
on his handling of his characters, 
who are consistent and warmly 
recognizable even in their stubborn 
irrationalities, on the boldness and 
provocation of his themes and his 
side remarks, on the richness of his 
auctorial background and the spar- 
kles of laughter finger-flicked all 
over his work. I base the second on

his willingness to pursue some 
collateral and fascinating line at 
the expense — and even the 
abandonment — of his central 
theme, which was (or so in the book 
he told me) the manufacture of 
exact simulacra of any human 
being and the impact of this 
development on humanity. The 
pursuit, in and out of the fringes of 
insanity, of an obsessive love affair 
had me laughing and crying, but 
Dick and I both were conned, 
weakwilled as dieters gobbling hot 
hot fudge sundaes, into this de- 
light instead of going about our 
business. 

Jeff Sutton’s novel The Mind- 
blocked Man is yet again one of 
those concealed-gimmick stories, in 
which one shrewd early guess will 
destroy the book for the reader. He 
awakes. He doesn’t recognize what 
he sees in the mirror. He doesn’t 
know who he is. He has fleet- 
ing memories he can’t place. 
Someone’s out to get him. Im- 
mense resources are brought to 
bear on him and he is trapped a lot, 
escapes a lot. Ultimately the fate of 
worlds depends on his actions and 
decisions. I have a stack of this 
stuff this high in my office and I 
don’t know what to do with it, since 
I won’t burn books. End listings of 
DAW for now. I think we all owe 
the tireless Mr. Wollheim a debt of 
gratitude. 



D avid gerrold’s when 

Harlie Was One is a con- 
scious-computer story with a very 
nicely evolved plot which I defy you 
to anticipate. Although his evil in- 
dustrialists tend a bit to simplism 
and Central Castings, his main 
characters are warmly human and 
dimensional. His computer, Harlie 
is both understandable and likable 
as a personality and, in its 
coldblooded objectivity, terrifying. 
Pay attention to Harlie. He gives us 
more than a glimpse of the potency 
of the computer and how it will af- 
fect us all even if it doesn’t achieve 
consciousness. The book carries a 
good freight of social and psycho- 
logical insight. 

I’ve just space to announce that 
Walt Lee’s monumental Reference 
Guide to Fantastic Films, Volume 
i,A-F, is now in print. It gives you 
every available bit of information 
(“available” means researchable by 
Lee, which means thorough) on 
fantastic films, their first US 
release titles, origins, classification 
(comedy, historical, surreal, etc.), 
length, production credits. There 
are thousands of entries — some 190 
pages of small print in a big (8‘/2 X 
11) well-bound and exceedingly 
handsome paperback — sprinkled 
throughout with historic stills and 
loaded with information. For

needs no excuse for being. Adventure, 
excitement, the old “sense of wonder" 
need no rationalization. Even pornog- 
raphy need not be burdened with 
redeeming social value if it succeeds in 
what it sets out to do — titillate. Ban it 
when it is boring. 

We are in another Age of Reason. If 
something appeals to our sense of 
beauty and not to our intellect we mis- 
trust it. If it gives us pleasure without 
purpose we fear it. And if it somehow 
manages to hang on despite these 
obstacles we feel obliged at least to 
pump it full of “meaning." Give it a 
cold, concrete handle. 

Let’s keep a touch of poetry in this 
prosaic Age of Reason. 

Brent Higginbotham

Directions: 

Robert F. Young’s “The Years,” 
printed in your September issue, was 
cute and I enjoyed it. But one thing 
about it bothered me — it was a time- 
travel story. To me, time travel isn’t 
science fiction. Let me explain why. 
For me science fiction deals with the 
future or outer space or science — in 
other words, that which is unknown but 
possible. That which is not possible or 
at least believable as possible is not 
science fiction but fantasy. 

Time travel does not fit the sf 
definition because it is neither possible 
nor believable. The entire concept is 
built upon an absurdity — a belief that 
since we remember an event that event 
always exists. In other words, if I once 
swing a baseball bat, then somehow, 
somewhere, I am always swinging that 
baseball bat. In addition, there is sup- 
posed to be an infinite number of me al- 



( Continued from page 6 ) 
ways doing all the things I have ever 
done — somewhere back in time. For 
me that is absurd and without -basis in 
credibility. I believe the past 
existed — but does not exist. Our 
memories and ideas of it exist, but even 
those can become distorted. If a man 
dies and if, despite all available evi- 
dence of his dissolution and decom- 
position you believe that he continues 
to live unchanged — then your belief is 
magical and childish. 

Time travel rests upon the inane 
assumption of the unchangeability of 
events, people and objects. If a writer 
can present a basis for the assumption 
that things do not change, he can make 
time travel into sf. If not, he deals in 
fantasy. Fantasy can, of course, be ter- 
rific.

Science fiction is finally being dis- 
covered for what it is— literature for 
the thinking man. 

Hugo Greensback was the father of 
the term “science fiction.” He 
considered it to be anything that takes 
place in the future that could one day 
become true. Almost all the well- 
known authors would be left out in the 
cold by this definition. 

With science fiction being taught in 
some colleges as a literature that deals 
with today {the Air Force Academy is a 
good example}, we can be sure that the 
change is for the better. Only time will 
show the full significance of the change, 
but I think most science fiction readers 
will be pleased with the final outcome.
