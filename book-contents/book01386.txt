PRICE OF HONOR 



Evolution had bestowed speech upon dogs and 
far hanrests upon man. All should have been 
paradise, yet bitter conflict persisted . 




NOVELETTE 




/ 



I 

R ay LARKIN hefted his energy 
rifle impatiently as Beowulf 
sniffed the air again and walked 
forward a few steps. Larkin watched 
the scout dog amble over to Little- 
john’s point and then to Anson’s. 
When brief, gravelly conversation 
with each assured Beowulf the area 
was clean, the scout dog trotted back 
to Larkin and growled, “Safe, Ray.” 
To a human ear untuned to a 
scout dog’s harsh and grating voice, 
the slurred flat speech might have 
been unintelligible. But to Ray 



Larkin it was perfectly clear. The 
three huge dogs and the man moved 
out, a well-coordinated unit. 

One of the other scout dogs had 
reported a large herd of those ante- 
lope-like animals in the area so Ray 
felt a little expedition was in order. 
The antelope always attracted pred- 
ators and Centaurs, posing a danger 
that could not be ignored. 

Larkin’s eyes never stopped 
moving, darting from small hill to 
small hill, questioning the slightest 
quiver of the low bushes. His caution 
was superfluous, he knew, for the 
dogs could sense any danger long 



7 



before it became apparent to his 
inferior senses. 

As he walked, Larkin inspected 
the small plants and wild grasses that 
would no longer exist after the 
voracious cholos passed this way, de- 
vouring everything in their path. The 
cholos had ' been at work terra- 
forming the surface of the continent 
for more than six months now. But 
Larkin, who had never worked with 
cholos before his marriage to Mary 
and Taylor, still found the giant slugs 
a source of wonder. At the moment 
they ought to be about two or three 
kilometers behind him, guided by 
Mary and Taylor and the remaining 
six scout dogs. 

He snapped out of his reverie as 
the dogs halted, testing the air. 
“What is it?” he called to Beowulf. 

“Hide cats. Maybe seven. Heading 
this way.” 

“Think they know we’re here?” 

Beowulf nodded his shaggy head 
at the rippling grass and answered, 
“Yes, Ray. Bad wind.” 

'Larkin agreed: the erratic wind 
was changing direction every few 
seconds, surely carrying the scent of 
man and dogs to the cats. It was the 
scout dogs who had named them , 
“hide cats.” The powerful felines 
preyed mainly on the antelope-like 
animals that grazed on the many wild 
grasses of the prairie. The cats were 
big, about one-and-a-half meters tall 
at the shoulder. For all their size, 
though, they were lean and sleek- 
obviously designed for explosive 
bursts of speed over limited dis- 



tances. In the open, however, or if 
the chase lasted for more than ten 
seconds, not even the fastest cat 
could catch the slowest of the 
amazingly fleet antelope with their 
comic but effective leaping gait. 
Neither were the cats six-limbed like 
the antelope although they carried 
tiny vestigial grasping limbs on both 
sides of their throats. But nature had 
given the hide cats an additional 
weapon to compensate for their lack 
of endurance. Each cat bore mark- 
ings on its sides enabling- it to lie 
down on one side and melt into the 
grass so perfectly that a careless 
antelope could stumble over the 
camouflaged creature before be- 
coming aware of its presence. 

Larkin disengaged the safety on 
his rifle and warned the dogs to be 
ready. “Those dumb bastards will 
rush us the moment they see us. 
They haven’t a brain in their heads,” 
he cautioned Littlejohn and the 
others. 

A trickle of sweat rolled down 
Larkin’s back in spite of the chill 
edge to the wind. Nor was he alone 
in feeling the tension that builds 
before action-the hair on the dogs’ 
necks was rising in ragged clumps, He 
wanted to crack a joke but could 
not. And though human testicles had 
lost that ability long ago, he thought 
he felt his own trying to ascend into 
his abdomen for protection. 

Larkin and the dogs topped a 
small rise— and suddenly were face to 
face with the hide cats. For one 
excruciatingly long second nothing 



8 



IF 




moved save the tops of the grasses. 
Then, like figures in a film that 
unexpectedly shifts from slow to 
speeded-up motion, both groups ex- 
ploded into action. 

Larkin was aware of the streak of 
yellow hurtling through the grass at 
him and he brought the rifle up to 
his shoulder in one quick motion, 
squeezing the trigger by reflex. The 
energy bolt blew the predator’s head 
off and the momentum of the cat’s 
attack carried its headless torso to 
Larkin’s booted feet, spraying them 
with blood. 

Beowulf, three hundred pounds of 
snapping, barking fury, bowled ovex- 
two cats larger than himself with an 
audacious charge. Confused and sur- 
prised, the two cats slashed out at 
each other as they tumbled over and 
over together. Beowulf took advan- 
tage of the situation to rip out the 
throat of the nearest one while it 
fought with its companion. 

Anson and Littlejohn, screaming 
canine obscenities, darted among 
three of the cats and slashed open 
their bellies. The enraged animals 
could only claw and bite futilely at 
the dogs’ long hair, a protection as 
efficient as armor so long as the cats 
were unable to find a secure hold. 

While Beowulf bit through the 
spinal cord of his hamstrung op- 
ponent, Larkin killed the remaining 
hide cat with a hurried shoulder shot. 

Anson, muzzle stained a deep red, 
looked down at a pile of steaming 
entrails on the grass, then turned to 
Littlejohn. “Fun, hah? Kill plenty 



hide cats this time. We teach cats to 
fool with man and dogs.” 

“Yeah,” agreed Larkin, wiping 
hide cat blood from his cheek. 
“Fun.” 



T he occupants of the camp 
moved leisurely among the small 
earthen huts and flickering cooking 
fires, laughing and gossiping. They 
were mostly females and children. 
The males, except those too old or 
crippled to hunt, were following a 
leaper herd to the south. Only two or 
three able-bodied warriors had been 
left behind to watch over the camp. 
The other males on hand, mostly 
malcontents or poor hunters, grum- 
bled about having to miss the excite- 
ment and glory of the hunt. 

Runner-with-the-Wind studied the 
activities of the camp from the top 
of a small hill. With him were twenty 
members of his sham, or war party. 
Despite the sounds of rapid breathing 
and the stamping of hoofs behind 
him, -Runner was not about to lead 
his warriors, many of them young- 
sters, down on the camp until he was 
absolutely certain everything was 
exactly as it seemed to be. Runner 
was young still, but determined not 
to make the mistakes of youth. He 
had successfully passed his manhood 
test six summers ago, killing 2ignur- 
as his people called hide cats— with 
nothing but his shar, the short thrust- 
ing spear all male warriors carried. He 
had been so sure of himself then; but 
the long scar on his left flank was a 



PRICE OF HONOR 



9 




constant reminder that unstudied ac- 
tion can lead to crippling or death. 
Still, his killing of the gnur after 
being severely wounded had been a 
bold act. His mother had made a 
song about his exploit and his elder 
brother had sung - it before their 
father and the council of the tribe. 
Both his father and his brother were 
dead now and it was he who carried 
the quirt of the chieftain, the koro. 

Finally satisfied that all was as it 
appeared. Runner gave a hand signal 
to attack. Hoofs blurring, the 
warriors swept over the crest of the 
hill. They yelled and screamed as 
they dashed across a water-gutted 
opening, barren of the life-giving 
teve, and into the camp. 

As the intruders swarmed around 
the outlying huts the few guards 
tried uselessly to halt the sham's 
advance. One old warrior, his tail 
braid already more white than 
brown, bravely planted himself 
squarely between the huts and the 
onrushing attackers. ' Gnurkiller, 
Runner’s chief lieutenant and 
younger brother, closed with him 
and the two whirled in a dance 
choreographed to end in death. 
Gnurkiller avoided a weak thrust and 
drove his own shar into the heavy 
lower body of the old warrior. The 
fire-hardened tip pierced the old 
one’s heart and he fell to his knees, 
crying out piteously before toppling 
into dust soaked with his own blood. 

Several of Runner’s warriors 
carried torches of dried teve which 
they lit by holding them over the 



cooking fires. Torches aflame, the 
intruders plunged into the darkness 
of the huts. Old men armed with 
nothing but stones were pushed back 
by the fire and then killed. Runner 
thrust his flaming bundle of teve into 
the face of a defender with a de- 
formed leg. The cripple recoiled, 
turned to run. Runner caught him at 
the door of the hut and speared him 
through the base of his skull. 

The hut interiors roiled with the 
chaos of close-quarter fighting. Some 
females remained passive. Others ran 
in circles, bit, kicked out and other- 
wise tried to avoid capture. To 
Runner’s way of thinking this was 
good: such females would bear bold 
sons. 

Many of the females had already 
borne children, of course, and often 
these children, unaware that the men 
wanted only young or childless 
women, tried to defend their 
mothers as best they could. Runner’s 
men were forced to slash with their 
hoofs at these young ones to drive 
them off. Children were knocked 
unconscious or, tumbled against the 
walls of the hut by the impatient 
raiders. 

“Quickly,” Runner-with-the-Wind 
shouted to his men in a hut grown 
foul with smoke and the sweat of 
fear. “Take the females and let us 
depart!” 

Runner was frantically trying to 
direct his companions’ efforts and 
see that none lingered too long in 
any one hut. 

“Idiots!” He struck two of his 



10 



IF 




warriors who had stopped to argue 
over a beautiful young female. The 
koro*s sting made them realize their 
foolishness. “This is not the time to 
fight among ourselves. Just take 
her!” Runner was only too aware 
that, had he allowed it, some of his 
men would be so foolish as to try to 
mount the females here and now. 
They were like so many children, and 
it was his responsibility to be their 
stern father. 

Driving the captured females— now 
called shaman, or booty-before 
them, the raiding party galloped out 
of the looted camp and disappeared 
into the still lowering darkness of 
night. Behind them a baby wailed 
forlornly. 

HE JOURNEY to their own 
camp was several hours long, and 
the captured females complained 
about everything— they were acting 
like true shaman already. Their feet 
were hot and tired; they were thirsty; 
they wanted to rest... Runner told 
them to be quiet or they would feel 
the caress of his koro. 

There was a time to be gentle and 
even loving to a shama but there was 
also a time when such forbearance ^ 
was jarringly out of place. His own 
shaman at the camp knew this belief 
of his and acted accordingly, careful 
of his ephemeral moods. Those 
among these captured females who 
would become his would soon learn 
the ways of their lord and master. 
Some would have to be beaten, some 
would cry out and tear their hair 



to complain of their rank within his 
family, but all would eventually 
acquiesce-they were shaman, after 
all, not warriors, not men. 

The young sentry at the camp 
touched his forehead in deference, 
then watched enviously as the suc- 
cessful raiding party marched 
proudly into its own encampment, 
wearing pride like fine bone-jewelry. 

“Runner, Runner!” shouted the 
eight shaman of his huts, crowding 
around him with their children cling- 
ing shyly to their hands. Runner 
reached out and pulled several of the 
females to him, giving each a hug or a 
warm caress. He disliked such public 
shows of affection but they were 
expected of him. Runner,'^ as always, 
submitted to the call of duty. He 
smiled at his children though he was, 
as always, slightly uncomfortable 
with them, especially his daughters. 
He wished he could remember the 
names of at least some of them, but 
to him all his children looked alike. 

He turned to the new shaman. 
Already several warriors were pre- 
pared to fight over the distribution 
of the females. He silenced their 
arguments with a hard glance and 
strode in among the females to have 
his pick of the lot. The raiding party 
had captured more than thirty and it 
was only fair that he, as chieftain, 
should receive at least four for his 
hut. 

Quickly he picked out three, amid 
incompletely stifled groans as favor- 
ites were lost. After his third choice 
he paused a moment, then slowly 




PRICE OF HONOR 



11 




ambled over to the beautiful young 
sharna who had nearly caused two of 
his men to come to blows in the 
enemy camp. 

“No!” gasped one of the two 
involuntarily. 

“No-? No?” rasped Runner-with- 
the-Wind. “Are you now chieftain 
here?” he demanded. He lashed out 
with his koro, landing a stinging blow 
across the other’s flank. “You shall 
choose last for daring to question my 
primacy 'Of choice!” 

The brief confrontation further 
upset the already frightened young 
sharna and she tried to back away, 
her flanks heaving. There was no 
place for her to go. Older females, 
aware of the futility of fighting the 
inevitable and resigned to the con- 
cept of marriage by kidnap, thrust 
her forward again. 

Runner-with-the-Wind held out his 
hand and spoke softly. “Come, little 
one. I will not harm you, I swear it.” 

Slowly, shyly, she stepped forward 
tentatively and slipped her small 
hand into his. His grasp reassured 
her. He led her quietly past his other 
newly acquired shaman, pausing only 
to speak to Nami, his number one 
sharna. “Take the other new ones to 
my huts and see that they are prop- 
erly fed. Then let them rest. I want 
no fighting among you. See that their 
welcome is genuine.” 

Runner-with-the-Wind led the 
young sharna, trembling still in fear 
and anticipation, to the privacy of 
the hut he kept solely for mating. He 
lit a candle of leaper fat and studied 



the planes of her face in its faint 
glow. 

“What is yoiir name, little one?” 

“Sunchaser.” 

“Do you know how old you are?” 

“I have seen fifteen summers.” 

“You look older. And you are 
very beautiful.” 

“Thank you, my lord. You are— I 
mean—” She cast her eyes down 
shyly, not daring to look at his lean 
hard body. 

Runner thoughtfully fingered one 
of his decorative scars. This one 
seemed so young, so innocent. He 
promised himself he would do 
nothing now to cause her in the 
future to fear his need for her. He 
would not take her in any manner 
that might turn her from him. He 
began.

M ARY^ Elizabeth Brennen 
Castle re agh-Larkin was dis- 
gusted by the interior of the nitro- 
propelled hover-van that served both 
as mobile lab and living quarters for 
her and Ray and Taylor. It was a 
mess. Not a dirty mess, but the kind 
of disorderly mess that any working 
area becomes when concern is more 
for the work than for appearance. 
The place had not really had a good 
cleaning in the nearly six months 
they had been on the surface of New 
Kansas, and it looked it. Mary did 
most of the cleaning, not because she 
was a woman and it was her place to 
do it— let Ray or Taylor suggest that

and she would remind them of her 
brown belt before bouncing them off 
the walls and ceiling-but because the 
lab was hers and she felt responsible 
for it. She knew, though, that both 
men would complain that putting 
things in some semblance of order 
would cause notes and papers, nor- 
mally right at hand, to lose them- 
selves under miscellaneous headings 
in the files. Well, the two of them 
would just have to scream, she con- 
cluded. But where to start? 

Roughly half the van was lab/work 
area, with the remaining half devoted 
to human needs. In the extreme rear 
of the van was the bathroom with its 
sonic shower and chemical toilet 
facilities. Further front were the 
sleeping quarters and the tiny closets 
totally inadequate to the needs of 
three people. Given all the limita- 
tions the living room, however, was 
fairly spacious with a carpet deep 
enough to lose a small dog in and 
body-heat furniture. Built into the 
walls were various audio-visual enter- 
tainment facilities to cut boredom 
into manageable sizes, and here and 
there aborigine sculpture from New 
Australia decorated the area. The 
reading material— enough to stock a 
fair-sized public library in a medium- 
sized city-was on microfilm and, via 
the stationary satellites ringing the 
planet, could be exchanged with the 
other 987 people busy terraforming 
other parts of New Kansas. At the 
midpoint of the van, situated to serve 
both working and living quarters, was 
the small electronic kitchen. 



The front of the van was devoted 
solely to Mary’s scientific instru- 
ments and measuring devices. The 
tiny lab computer could handle 
minor problem-solving chores and 
little else, but it saved Mary drudg- 
ery. 

Tall and slender, with curves and 
hollows in all the right places, Mary 
was a stunning young woman. Her 
chestnut hair cascaded down to her 
shoulders, enhancing a light dusting 
of freckles. But she had not been 
attractive as a child and had not yet 
fully accepted as real her meta- 
morphosis into a beauty. 

Mary had been taking post- 
graduate courses in chemistry at the 
University of Brazil when she first 
met Ray Larkin through her husband 
Taylor. Soon the three were spending 
a great deal of time together. Then 
Taylor, an agrobiologist already ac- 
cepted into the Planetary Coloniza- 
tion Bureau, spent six months on the 
colony planet learning the ins and 
outs of breeding and caring for 
cholos. His only obligation was one 
year’s service for the Bureau. 

Placed in charge of “protecting” 
Mary by a trusting Taylor during his 
absence, Ray started to fall in love 
with her himself. It had all seemed so 
ludicrous at first: Mary was a mem- 
ber of the Matriarchal Party, from 
which came almost all of the Federa- 
tion’s leaders, and she had wounded 
a man in a duel. Protecting Mary 
seemed as necessary as protecting a 
scout dog from a chipmunk. 

As for Ray Larkin, he was an 



PRICE OF HONOR 



13 




indifferent anthropologist. He had 
written his thesis on the social inter- 
action and sexual practices of scout 
dogs. This led to an ever greater 
degree of interest in the dogs and he 
applied for his own team. As a 
free-lancer he and his dogs had com- 
pleted two lucrative missions for the 
Bureau by the time he met Taylor 
and Mary. 

Ray was slight, a writer of poetry, 
and basically a loner. For most of his 
life he had felt himself outside the 
mainstream of human social activity. 
He would rather play complex games 
with Cheng, his cybernetic apartment 
house computer, than attend a party 
or group grope. Mary had grown used 
to staying in on Saturday nights with 
him in his apartrrient, smoking 
through a few narcostiks and listen- 
ing to his unique collection of scout- 
dog folk songs rather than joining 
other students in more typical activi- 
ties. 

And then Taylor returned. Ray 
and Mary had struggled to devise 
some painless way of telling him 
about them. Actually they had not 
had to say a word— their faces had 
told the story .vin two months they 
had put their thumbs to a “triple”— a 
three-way marriage contract. 

461¥7HAT is it, Anson?” 

fTThe big dog had just trotted 
back from his position as point. 
“Centaurs been here— nosing ’round, 
Ray,” the dog replied. 

Ray then saw the marks left by 
the hoofed feet of the Centaurs. 



“Yeah, I guess you’re right. They’re 
still curious about us.” 

“Hah!” said Beowulf. “Anson is so 
hurried up-” 

“Anxious,” corrected Ray. 

“Yah— anxious, then, to get back 
to camp today. That why he was first 
to smell Centaurs. Mebbe Anson 
anxious see someone.” 

“Mebbe Ozma,” suggested Little- 
john. 

“What you know!” snapped An- 
son. 

“Well, now,” said Ray. “I’ve 
noticed, too, how you’ve been 
sniffing around Ozma a bit more 
than around the other females. You 
wouldn’t be having a little private 
romance with her, would you?” Ray 
knew the scout dogs were not nor- 
mally monogamous. 

“We are almost there,” said Anson 
stonily. The rest laughed at his 
obvious discomfort, but neither long 
nor nastily. 

Ray left the dogs to proceed on 
their own into camp and headed for 
the line of cholos. They never ceased 
to amaze him and he often stopped 
off on his way back to the hover-van 
to watch them methodically eating 
their way through the grasses. 

It was rapidly getting dark and 
Ray nearly stumbled when he 
emerged from the heavy grass onto a 
bare patch of earth. Completely de- 
void of grass, the patch was as wide 
as a country lane and snaked away 
through the grass. Ray followed the 
“road” with his eyes— right up to the. 
point where it ran smack up to a 



14 



IF 




huge “rock” lying across its path. 
The “rock” was a cholo. The “road” 
through the grass was the result of 
the cholo’s having just passed 
through a few minutes ago. 

The cholo’s size became readily 
apparent as Ray approached it from 
behind. He walked forward until the 
rear of the gray-white mass of the 
creature’s body loomed over him. 
Because of his position he had no 
fear for his life-no cholo could move 
in any direction but forward. In 
addition, a cholo was harmless unless 
frightened. Even then Ray would 
have to be standing in its immediate 
path to be injured. 

The square, blunt tail of the cholo 
scraped over the bare ground, leaving 
it moist and steaming slightly in the 
cool evening air. There was a notice- 
able though not unpleasant odor 
rising from the newly bared soil in 
the wake of the giant beast. 

R ay smiled to himself as he 
remembered the day Taylor had 
shown him his first cholo. The smell 
was one of the first things he had 
asked about. 

“That odor, what is it? It’s-it’s 
almost like-” 

“Like freshly baked bread?” 
finished Taylor. 

“Yeah, that’s it.” 

“Shit.” 

“Ahhh, I beg your pardon?” 

Taylor laughed and explained, 
“It’s the smell of a cholo’s natural 
excretion.” 

“Oh.” 



Ray slowly walked over to the 
untouched grass parallel to the track 
of the cholo. It was the first cholo 
Ray had ever seen outside of holo- 
graphs and it was indeed an im- 
pressive sight. Only the great blue 
whale of the Terran oceans could 
equal it in size— but of course there 
were no more blue whales on Earth. 

“How much does one of those 
things weigb?” 

“Approximately fifteen tons,” 
Taylor replied. “That’s back on 
Earth, of course, not here on this 
training planet. They’re twenty 
meters long by three meters wide and 
four meters high. They eat the equiv- 
alent of their own weight every 
twenty-four hours. Earth-standard 
time. Developed over two hundred 
years ago by the Bureau’s labs from 
unsegmented earthworms, they’re ar- 
tificially engineered creatures specifi- 
cally developed to range over the 
surfaces of Terran-type planets un- 
able to-” He stopped, shaking his 
head. “I’m sorry. I’m afraid I’m 
beginning to lecture.” 

“Please go on. It’s all most fas- 
cinating.” 

“Well, okay. As I was saying, 
they’re put to work on planets un- 
able to support Terran plant forms in 
their unaltered states. For instance, 
on New Kansas the cholos will eat 
great swathes through the local vege- 
tation and topsoil and excrete a 
waste. That waste is as deadly a 
poison for the native plants as it is a 
highly efficient fertilizer for the 
Terran crops that will some day be

growing here long after the cholos 
have passed.” 

He pointed to the bare earth left 
in the wake of the cholo. 

“On New Kansas, with its winds, 
soil left like that would soon blow 
away. The last thing we’ll be trying 
to create is a dustbowl, so to hold 
the newly transformed soil for the 
Terran plants we’ll sow Terran 
grasses behind the cholos.” 

T hat had been Ray’s introduc- 
tion to the cholos. Now, on New 
Kansas himself, he never tired of 
observing their endless mealtime. 

He walked to .the front of the 
cholo and watched it attack the 
grasses with great vigor. The cholo’s 
mouth was a gaping hole into which 
the tall grass disappeared. This cholo, 
like the others, never stopped eating: 
cholos possessed no muscles to close 
their mouths. 

Ray lit a narcostik and stared at 
the creature’s featureless visage. 
Nothing but the mouth differen- 
tiated the cholo’s front from its rear. 
The huge slug was eyeless— Ray’s 
dogs served as the cholos’ eyes. , 

Each dog carried a small trans- 
mitter on a collar around its neck. 
Similarly, each of the cholos had a 
small receiver implanted in its flesh 
on both the right and left sides of its 
body. Slaved to the transmitters, the 
receivers imparted a brief, sharp stab 
of pain-whenever one of the dogs got 
within ten meters of a cholo. This 
made it easy for the cholos to be 
driven in any desired direction. In its 



forehead each cholo also had a small 
electronic “eye” that sent back 
images to Ray’s pocket receiver and 
to a receiver in the van. By choosing 
among channels one to twenty-five 
Ray could monitor any of the 
cholos. 

Ray mused that his was not an 
easy job. He had a hover-scooter and 
nine dogs, one of which was preg- 
nant. The ten of them were supposed 
to guard and guide twenty-five 
cholos. That meant keeping away 
hide cats and curious Mierson’s Cen- 
taurs. The Centaurs seemed content 
to leave the cholos and dogs alone. 
For the time being, anyway. 

Ray ground out his butt and 
headed back for the van. 

B eowulf led Ws small party 
back to the temporary camp Ray 
had devised for the scout dogs. His 
lips curled back in pleasure as first 
the females and then the males 
greeted him. 

“How it go?” asked the pregnant 
Mama-san. 

“Good. We got to kill hide cats.” 
“Oh?” said Frodo. “Tell us ’bout 
it.” 

Beowulf shook his head. “Food 
first. Then I tell all that happened.” 
Even as he spoke Pandora brought 
him some antelope meat. Ozma did 
the same for Anson and Littlejohn. 

“Before eat, we recite the Law,” 
said Beowulf. 

They formed a rough circle. 

“What is the Law?” intoned Beo- 
wulf. 



16 



IF 




‘To stand by Man *s side, as dogs 
have always stood. ** 

“What is the Law?” 

‘To place duty above self, honor 
above life. ” 

“What is the Law?” 

“7b allow harm to come to no 
man, to protect man and his posses- 
sions. ” 

“What is the Law?” 

“7b stand by man *s side -as dogs 
will always stand. ” 

“Let us eat.” 

R UNNER’S various shaman, new 
and old, were finishing their meal 
of leaper flesh cooked over damp 
leaves lying on hot coals. As they ate 
they stared morosely at Runner’s 
mating hut. 

Kirinav, Runner’s number two 
sharna, glanced at one of the new 
females and asked, “You-what is the 
name of the new shama spending the 
night with Runner?” 

The young sharna chewed on a 
piece of rubbery meat for a moment 
before replying. “My name is 
Zarav— not "you." The one our man 
took is named Sunchaser. Had it not 
been for the raid she would have 
been sleeping with another in one 
moon’s time.” 

“Bah! All men are the same,” 
sneered Nan-ha. 

“I don’t believe that,” said Peo. 
“Runner is good to us. And brave.” 
“Bravery,” said Kirinav, looking 
up momentarily from her self- 
appointed task of braiding a young 
child’s tail. “What is bravery but a 



word the men use to hide the killing 
of the old and weak?” 

“How can you say that? What do 
you mean?” asked Zarav. 

“She means,” replied Nan-ha, 
“that our men play at war and 
raiding as our children play at tag.” 

“I did not wish to be taken away 
from my tribe,” said a puzzled Zarav, 
“but nothing about it resembled 
child’s play. Many brave, old and 
crippled men died defending us from 
seizure.” 

“God of the Winds!” exclaimed 
Kirinav, “she really doesn’t know the 
truth!” 

“Truth? What truth?” asked a 
still-bewildered Zarav. 

Nami, who had been listening 
silently but had been reluctant to 
enter the conversation until now, put 
her arm around Zarav and asked, 
“Do you in all honesty really not 
know about the raids the men carry 
out?” 

“Please, what are you all talking 
about?” 

“I will tell you,” said Nan-ha. “It 
is all an elaborate game, played so 
that the warriors of the tribes might 
mate with shaman from other camps. 
In any camp, at least five or six 
females are born for every male. 
When one tribe’s council feels that 
there are enough young females of 
child-bearing age and enough old or 
crippled warriors to warrant it, they 
approve a raid against their own 
camp. Nothing is done overtly. In- 
stead, they become careless ever so 
slowly. Soon scouts from other tribes

17 




are aware of where their camp is and 
how many females without children 
are living in it. Then, one day, the 
warriors make a great show of going 
off to hunt leapers. The old and the 
lame are left behind to guard the 
females. When the warriors finally 
return, they find that their camp has 
been raided. Much noise is made, but 
somehow the raiders are never 
found.” She paused a moment. “And 
that is how your camp came to be 
raided, too.” 

“No! I cannot believe such a mon- 
strous thing! What about the old 
ones— they fought back, they tried!” 
“Yes, of course. Such a raid is 
their chance to find a death weighted 
with honor, not shame. The same 
holds true for the lame and crippled. 
And there are boundaries which must 
be observed. You have noticed, 
haven’t you, th^t only females with- 
out children were taken— those who 
had no husbands to feed them?” 
“But-” 

“Hush, child,” soothed Nami. 
“Men must have their chance to feel 
brave. Besides, it has gotten you a 
husband and provider.” 

Ill 

A fter Ray had told Mary and 
L Taylor about the hide cats that 
evening, he mentioned Anson’s find- 
ing the scent of Centaurs just outside 
the camp. 

“What do you think it means?” 
asked Mary. 

“Hard to say,” answered Ray. 



“Maybe they’re just curious about 
us.” 

“1 hope that’s all it is,” said! 
Taylor. “But don’t count on it.” 

“Ah, want to elaborate on that?” 
said Ray. 

“Sure. There are dozens of other 
groups on the various continents 
working the land just as we are, 
right? Well, some of them have 
started having more run-ins with the 
Centaurs than ever before.” 

“I see,” said Ray slowly. 

“You and the dogs better be extra 
careful from now on.” 

“Hmmm. I suppose you’re right.” 
Ray thought about the Cen- 
taurs— and that evoked memories of 
the day the three of them had signed 
on for New Kansas. 

M elvin nhroma, half black 

and half Israeli, a round man 
with gleaming ivory teeth, was the 
career Planetary Colonization Bureau 
official in charge of recruiting terra- 
formers for New Kansas. If he carried 
off the precolonization operations 
cleanly he would be promoted to the 
position of Assistant to the Assistant 
to the Co-Vice-Director of Sector 
Ag-17n. 

Sitting across from Nhroma, with 
Taylor and Mary, Ray fidgeted in his 
chair. He wished the man would 
cease sermonizing and get to the 
signing of the papers. 

“Yes, New Kansas will be a mar- 
velous colony world for us. Of course 
the soil must be altered ever so 
slightly to favor Terran plants, and 



18 



IF 




the oceans must be sown with micro- 
organisms to prepare vast areas of the 
northern continent for eventual colo- 
nization and farming. It won’t be 
easy.” Ray cupped his chin in his 
hands; he knew a zealot when he saw 
one. “There will be wild animals, 
disease, wind, cold, but eventually 
you will triumph.” 

“We’re not heroes, you know,” 
said Taylor. “We’ll be getting paid 
for our efforts.” 

“Certainly. Those of you who 
survive— if I may be so indelicate- 
will be named First Citizens of New 
Kansas. A special tax will be levied 
on the colonists to keep you in 
luxury for the rest of your lives— if 
that is what you desire.” 

“Yes, yes,” said Ray impatiently, 
“but you mentioned wild animals. 
Does that category include the Mier- 
son’s Centaurs?” 

“Where— how ' did you learn of 
them?” 

“Things have a way of getting 
around.” 

“Well, I suppose I must be frank, 
then. As you probably know already, 
they’re called Mierson’s Centaurs 
after the xenobiologist of the first 
scouting party to explore New 
Kansas. In reality, of course, they 
bear only a surface resemblance to 
Earth’s mythical half-human, half- 
horse centaurs,” he explained. 

“And how did Mierson find out 
all this?” asked Mary. 

“There was a fight. An expedition 
member and two Centaurs were 
killed. One of the two Centaurs 



happened to be female and Mierson’s 
cursory dissection turned up some 
interesting anomalies.” 

“Such as?” 

“Well, the Centaurs are a curious 
mixture of mammalian and reptilian 
life. Like mammals, they bear their 
young alive from an internal womb 
and suckle them from teats on the 
undersides of their bodies-just 
where they’re located on a horse or 
cow.” 

“That figures,” mused Ray. 

Nhroma ^iled and went on. 
“The ‘man’ part of their anatomy, 
however, is covered by a tough rep- 
tilian hide. They have a hafrless skull 
that is remarkably humanoid— two 
eyes, a nose of sorts, a mouth with 
the kind of teeth one might expect 
to find in any omnivorous life form, 
including man. But they are pri- 
marily carnivores, not herbivores. 
The rest of their humanoid upper 
torso is little more than an enlarged, 
heavily muscled neck to which two 
arms with opposed-thumb hands con- 
nect. Lungs, heart and digestive 
organs are all in the “horse” part of 
their bodies.” 

“They’re hunters, aren’t they?” 
asked Ray. 

“Yes. They subsist mainly on the 
antelope-like forms that roam the 
prairies. The Centaurs add to that 
diet by catching small animals and 
gathering wild roots and other plants 
that require no cultivation.” 

“All well and good,” said Mary. 
“But isn’t it contrary to the-Plane- 
tary Colonization Code of 2207? 



PRICE OF HONOR 



19 




Intelligent life forms whose tech- 
nology is inferior to our own are not 
to be exploited or subjected to xeno- 
cide.” 

“Ah,” said Nhroma, “there you 
have the crux of the matter. The 
Centaurs have not been officially 
recognized as intelligent. There is 
some doubt they ever will be. Our 
current resources and the need for 
new worlds are such that no matter 
what the eventual findings prove 
about the Centaurs, we must go 
forward with colonization.” 

“You’re saying that colonization 
will go forward regardless of the 
harm done to the Centaurs?” 

“Now just a minute. That’s un- 
fair!” Nhroma retorted. “The Cen- 
taurs will be taken care of. Land will 
be set aside especially for them. The 
colonial government will see to their 
welfare.” 

His listeners appeared skeptical. 
“Look, as things are now all that 
prairie is essentially going to waste. 
In ten, twelve years it could be 
feeding thousands. Ultimaftely it will 
feed millions. And still the Centaurs 
will have lands on which to live and 
hunt. The Bureau has learned from 
the brutal mistakes of the past.” 

“But what if the Centaurs don’t 
take kindly to our usurping their 
lands. What if they should attack 
us?” persisted Ray. 

“Well— in that case, you must 
defend yourselves, mustn’t you?” 

T he sun had risen. Runner de- 
cided it was time to get the tribe 



moving. The raid must follow form; 
many &ays’ travel must be put be- 
tween themselves and the sacked 
camp. Further, this area was just 
about hunted out. They would move 
north in pursuit of the great herds of 
leapers that provided his people with 
the necessities of life. Not only food, 
but tools, weapons and rude clothing 
were the legacy of each leaper felled 
by a warrior of the tribe. Upon the 
leapers^ the tribe depended for its 
very existence. And the leapers, in 
turn, were dependent upon the wild 
grasses of the prairie for their lives. 

Under Runner’s prodding camp 
was struck and the meager tools and 
possessions of the tribe were placed 
on rude travois to be carried to the 
next settlement. The tribe’s nomadic 
itinerary would follow the move- 
ments of the great herds of leapers. 

Leaperstalker, one of Runner’s 
lieutenants, was trying to make him- 
self important, dashing about yelling 
orders, pleading for haste, snapping a 
length of rawhide at shaman slow to 
join the ragged line of march. Runner 
smiled, content to allow his seconds- 
in-command to whip the people into 
line— and incur their natural resent- 
ment. That was a trick Runner had 
learned first from his father and then 
from his elder brother: the chieftain 
must, in his people’s eyes, be the 
guiding spirit of the tribe; he must be 
the font of wisdom, of leadership, 
the dispenser of all good, including 
food and Discipline, though, 

recognized as originating with the 
chieftain, was meted out by the 



20 



IF 




members of the council, by Runner’s 
lieutenants. 

When all was ready, when the 
shaman had sorted themselves into 
marching order according to their 
status within the tribe and the scouts 
had taken up their positions, 
Runner-with-the-Wind took his place 
at the head of the column. He held 
hi^ his koro, the visible badge of his 
leadership. All the males touched 
their right fists to their foreheads, 
reaffirming loyalty to the chieftain. 
Runner acknowledged the salute, 
adding his shar to his koro then 
lowering both. The tribe moved out. 

660 O,” Ray was saying, “I don’t 
i^think we’re in any danger from 
the Centaurs.” 

Taylor put down his coffee cup. 
“Look, Ray, we’re more than nine 
hundred kilometers from the nearest 
cholo group.” 

“Well, what’s your point?” 

“Do you know how I’ve been 
driving the cholos?’’ 

“Normally in a line about one to 
two kilometers wide, right?” 

“Yes. Obviously it’s not compact 
enough for them to scour each and 
every square meter of vegetation. But 
that’s not necessary. Given a good 
toehold, our tough Terran grasses 
spread out slowly from the cholos’ 
original paths and displace the 
weaker native grasses.” 

“Thank you, Melvin Nhroma.” 

“So I’m lecturing-this is impor- 
tant. For the time being I see no 
reason to change the pattern. But if 



we have any run-ins with the Cen- 
taurs I want to move the cholos in 
closer. They won’t be as efficient, 
but you and the dogs can guard them 
better.” 

“I hope your confidence isn’t 
misplaced.” 



H IS scouts led Runner to the low 
bluff overlooking the valley? 
From his vantage point he could 
clearly see the paths of destruction 
the scouts had been unable to stop 
jabbering about since they had first 
dashed back to the tribe’s makeshift 
temporary camp. They were pouring 
out a tale of great strips ef teve 
somehow torn from the land. 

“What could have done this, 
Runner?” one of his men asked as all 
stared unbelievingly at the sight. 

“I do not know. There is no 
mention of such a thing in the songs 
of our forefathers. It is a new ca- 
lamity.” 

“Ah,” someone grunted, “here 
comes Sharcarrier. He has been down 
on the valley floor examining this 
great curse from close up. Perhaps he 
has seen something we cannot dis- 
cern from here.” 

When at last the young warrior 
reported to his chieftain, the news 
was not good. The youth had noticed 
that the soil, where the teve had been 
stripped away, was not completely 
bare after all. Instead the shoots of a 
new and strange form of teve could 
be seen pushing from the ground. 
Sharcarrier had noticed that ahead

this vegetation seemed less estab- 
lished, while farther behind it was 
even thicker and more luxuriant than 
at the spot he had first examined. 

“And,” Sharcarrier told Runner- 
with-the-Wind, “if you follow this 
strange path back far enough, you 
come to places where the new teve is 
as thick and heavy as the old was.” 
He paused to gulp for breath. “But 
even more sinister, this new teve 
spreads like a slow fire through the 
rest of the teve killing it and taking 
its place on the prairie.” 

“What of the animals?” ques- 
tioned Runner. 

“There are none.” 

“But if there is teve then surely 
there must be leapers. And where 
there are leapers there are gnur to 
hunt them!” 

“I don’t think the leapers can eat 
this new teve. They have moved 
away in search of food.” 

As Runner was digesting this dis- 
turbing piece of information another 
member of the scouting party said, 
“Then we must move on until we 
again find the great herds.” 

“Yes,” said Runner-with-the-Wind 
with sudden vehemence, “but what 
shall we do if this new teve becomes 
a great blaze that consumes all in its 
way? The leapers will disappear for 
lack of food.” He paused. “And so 
shall all who are nourished by the 
herds.” 

“You mean the gnurV" ques- 
tioned a youth. 

“Yes,” answered another. “But 
not solely the gnur. ” 



T he dogs were happy. Littlejohn, 
Ozma and Mama-san had to re- 
main with the cholos to Jceep watch 
but the other six had permission to 
go hunting on their own. The free- 
dom made them pups again. 

“Hah,” said Pandora, “is fun to 
chase antelopes again.” The other 
dogs, moving in a loose pack, agreed. 

“Frodo,” said Beowulf, “you 
better stay last. You too fat to catch 
antelopes.” 

“Yeah,” agreed Grendel. “Frodo’s 
belly drag on ground. Ha ha-” 

While Grendel was laughing Frodo 
suddenly leaped at her, knocking her 
down with a well-placed shoulder 
block and giving her a nip on the 
rump as he did so. “Ha, I not too fat 
to bite your ass, Grendel.” All the 
other dogs laughed— except Beo- 
wulf, who moved further away when 
Frodo turned to stare in his direc- 
tion. 

The pack trotted on, telling dirty 
jokes and arguing about who was the 
most spectacularly endowed with re- 
spect to sexual equipment. 

“You can talk,” said Grendel, 
“but Littlejohn not little where it 
counts.” 

“Ho,” said Beowulf. “Mebbe 
that’s why Ray make Littlejohn stay 
behind— he too tired carrying great 
weight around to chase antelopes.” 
“I bet Littlejohn not too tired to 
chase Ozma or Mama-san,” quipped 
Frodo. 

Pandora added to Grendel’s pique 
by saying, “What make you think he 
have to chase them?” 



22 



IF 




The snickering had died down by 
the time Anson, who had gone on 
ahead to scout, returned. 

“Which?” asked Beowulf, seeing 
the joy in Anson’s eyes. “Hide cats 
or antelopes?” 

“Antelopes. Just over hill.” His 
tongue hanging out, Anson con- 
tinued, “Wind’s blowing this way. 
Ought to catch scent soon as we 
move closer. Mebbe ten of them in 
nice, tight group,” 

“Good,” said Sinbad. “We take 
one same way as usual?” 

“Why not?” replied Frodo. “It 
works.” 

“So let’s go,” said Anson, the 
thrill of the impending chase burning 
bright in his eyes. 

Grendel and Sinbad moved out to 
the right to flank the unsuspecting 
antelope. Pandora and Beowulf took 
the left flank, leaving Anson and 
Frodo to proceed straight ahead. The 
two dogs in the center waited for the 
others to take up their positions, 
then loped forward slowly. They 
topped the slight hill, moving toward 
the antelope through the cover of the 
high grasses. The antelope continued 
grazing until the two dogs were 
nearly on top of them. Then 
suddenly one of the antelope raised 
its head and snorted in alarm. Like 
fragments of a shellburst antelope 
scattered in every direction, bound- 
ing across the plain in great, twisting 
leaps. 

As soon as the antelope broke, 
Frodo and Anson leaped in pursuit. 
Frodo flung a brief burst of words in 



Anson’s direction and the two of 
them decided on one of the scatter- 
ing antelope, ignoring the others. 
They forced it in the direction of " 
Grendel and Sinbad on the right. Just 
as the antelope reached the grass 
concealing the pair, they broke from 
hiding and charged. Flinging itself 
around in midair, the startled ante- 
lope changed direction. Now moving 
at right angles to the hiding place of 
Pandora and Beowulf, the antelope 
was forced again to change its line of 
flight when they burst across its 
path. All six dogs were now in 
pursuit, driving the frantic antelope 
back and forth among them. 

In the mad ecstasy of the chase 
the dogs were barking furiously, 
human speech completely forgotten. " 
They were reenacting an ancient 
ritual of pursuit and death that pre- 
dated even their ancestors’ associa- 
tion with the shambling primate that 
was to become man. 

The terrified antelope would run 
flat out in what it hoped was the 
path to safety only to have one of 
the dogs loom up, teeth bared, forc- 
ing it to change direction. Built for 
speed but not for endurance, the 
antelope soon began to tire. The dogs 
closed in. Its tongue lolled gro- 
tesquely from the corner of its 
mouth as it sou^it some escape from 
the circle of canines. 

Flanks heaving, the antelope 
stumbled in fatigue and immediately 
Pandora leaped upon its back. The 
assault knocked it to the ground. The 
other dogs were soon tearing and

slashing at its throat. It thrashed and 
kicked in mindless terror as its life- 
blood spurted in streams. The felled 
beast gave one final shudder and its 
eyes went blank. 

There was blood everywhere. The 
dogs were covered by it; it dripped 
from their fangs. Sinbad raised his 
muzzle to the sky and, from deep 
within his throat, issued an ancient 
howl— a cry of triumph and a chal- 
lenge to whomever would dare dis- 
pute his prowess as a hunter. Then he 
joined the others in tearing the ante- 
lope to pieces in a glorious orgy of 
primitive bloodlust. 

66V OU saw them leave the body 

M, of the leaper?” asked 
Runner-with-the-Wind . 

“Yes. I heard a terrible cry of 
pain or pleasure and investigated. 
They were just leaving the body of 
the leaper when I spotted them. I 
made certain I stayed downwind of 
them. They were huge, almost as big 
as a male gnur. ” 

“And they didn’t eat the leaper’s 
flesh?” 

“No, though they tore its body to 
pieces. Perhaps they drank its 
blood.” 

“Hmmm. I would see these beasts 
and the wondrous creatures they 
guard with my own eyes. Come, let 
us make plans to test the defenses of 
these monsters with the rising of the 
next sun.” 

66 ARE YOU SURE?” Taylor 

xm. asked Anson. 



“Yep. They kept back, but we 
knowed they watching us.” 

“Three hours, you say? We’ve had 
Centaurs stumble across our path and 
become curious enough to investi- 
gate, but never for such a long period 
of time. Did they know that you 
knew they were watching?” 

“Hunh? Oh, no, don’t think_so.” 
“Okay, you’d better get back to 
your post. I’ll see what Ray has to 
say about this.” 

IV 

R unner felt that he and his 
warriors were ready— as ready as 
they would ever be. Even as he 
prepared himself to test the defenses 
of the monsters, he thought about 
the events of last evening • • • 

Runner had watched the seer 
throw the leaper bones three times. 
“Well?” he had asked the man of 
magic. 

“The spirits say the signs are 
good.” 

“Yes— the spirits are already dead 
and do not have to make the attack. 
It is easy for them to say the signs 
are good.” 

“Do not speak blasphemy, my 
son!” 

“I try not to, though it is difficult. 
And I worry. Perhaps the spirits seek 
company in their land of death-” 
Outside the holy one’s hut, 
Runner’s shaman had gathered to 
wait for him. “What is this?” he had 
asked. 

“Do not go. Runner,” pleaded 



24 



IF 




Teffl. “The monsters will devour you 
all!’- 

“Have you no faith in the strength 
of my arm? Besides, you worry too 
soon. The council has not voted yet.” 

“You know they will do what you 
want them to,” said Nami. 

“A sharna should not be so per- 
ceptive,” Runner replied, smiling. 
Then: “Hold up my first-born son. I 
would see him before I enter the 
council meeting-place.” 

Only three summers old, the 
young male was handed gingerly 
from sharna to sharna until Runner 
could cradle the small form in his 
arms. He hugged the smaller version 
of himself, then lifted him high in 
the air and shouted, “My son, my 
heir! If I do not return, he is the new 
chieftain!” 

The new chieftain had started to 
wail. 

T he CHOLO moved placidly for- 
ward, eating, while the Centaurs 
edged in closer, as yet unnoticed by 
the dogs. 

“It pays us no heed!” said an awed 
warrior. 

“No wonder,” replied Runner. 
“Look, it has no nose, nor eyes-only 
that great mouth.” 

“So,” said Moon-son. “Let us kill 
it and stop the evil it does.” 

“Moon-son is right,” agreed 
Runner. “We must use our shars on 
this beast.” 

^ At that the warriors, shars poised 
to strike, moved in and surrounded 
the cholo. 



Runner chose a flank. “Die, mon- 
ster!” he shouted as he plunged 
home his shar. Immediately the 
others began thrusting their short 
shars into the body of the great 
teve-t2iitx. 

Reacting to pain unlike any it had 
ever felt before, the cholo shuddered 
and tried to escape by charging for- 
ward. 

Moon-son, caught unaware by the 
beast’s sudden spurt of speed, tried 
to get out of its path. Too late— the 
huge creature lunged forward in fear 
and pain, knocking Moon-son off his 
feet. Screaming, Moon-son tried to 
get up. Before he could, the entire 
front of the cholo came down on 
him like a dark shadow and abruptly 
cut off his scream. 

“God of the Winds!” shouted a 
shocked warrior. 

“Keep thrusting!” Runner 
ordered. 

The cholo bellowed and tried to 
flip over to its back but lacked the 
strength. Still, only after hundreds of 
blows had been struck did the crea- 
ture die. 

“We did it!” shouted the warriors 
at last, realizing the reve-eater finally 
was dead. 

But there was no time for re- 
joicing. Growls and barks of anger 
and challenge reached them. 

“The leaper killers!” shouted 
Runner. “Prepare for the attack!” 

The warriors formed a rude circle, 
faced outward. Not a moment too 
soon-the leaper killers were already 
on them. 



PRICE OF HONOR 



25 




It quickly became clear to Runner 
that he and his men could not 
conquer these snarling, darting 
shapes. The beasts rushed in, slashed 
at Runner’s men with their fangs 
while adroitly avoiding the thrusts of 
the shars, then backed off for an- 
other rush. 

Yet the contest appeared a stand- 
off. No one on either side would be 
able to inflict any serious wounds 
without risking death. 

Runner did what he thought best. 
“Quickly, let us retreat!” His men 
wheeled and galloped across the 
plains. 

The leaper killers tried to follow 
but were unable to maintain the 
speed of Runner’s warriors. 

When it appeared they had safely 
outrun their pursuers. Runner dared 
slow down and turn back to look. He 
glimpsed one of the two-legged be- 
ings among the leaper killers. The 
strange being was pointing something 
in his direction. Suddenly a mound 
of soil to Runner’s right burst into a 
hundred bits. This was followed by a 
loud report from the direction of the 
two-legged one. Runner urged his 
men to more speed. 

When they reached camp, it be- 
came a scene of jubilation. The 
warriors were welcomed back as 
heroes, as mortals bold enough to 
battle monsters and emerge un- 
scathed and victorious. Runner’s 
shaman and children swarmed about 
him ecstatically. The older children 
clamored for his attention while the 
younger were pushed forward to be 



taken and held by him for a few 
seconds. It was as if to touch him 
were to touch someone godlike: his 
shar, his whistler, his koro, all were 
touched, stroked, grasped briefly. His 
wives kicked and shoved each other 
to be near him, ignoring all pretense 
of status order. It was the same with 
the rest of the tribe. The only ones 
not celebrating were the people of 
Moon-son’s hut. 

“Moon-son died a warrior’s 
death,” Runner told them. “Rejoice. 
He has joined the ancient heroes sung 
in the songs of the tribe.” 

T aylor looked at Ray as if he 
were a stranger. “The dogs say 
you missed hitting the leader of the 
Centaurs by a good two meters. I 
know you’re a dead shot, even at 
that distance. So what happened?” 
“I-I don’t know. I just couldn’t 
kill him unfairly, I guess.” 

“Jesus-” Taylor shrugged re- 
signedly. 

44/^ OLD, hunh?” Grendel asked 
Beowulf. 

“Yah, but spring coming.” 

“So are big winds, Ray say.” 

“And they not make our job 
easier,” Beowulf acknowledged. 

Grendel looked down the line of 
cholos. “Littlejohn coming.” 

“What is it?” Beowulf asked when 
Littlejohn reached them. 

“Nothing. Ray sent me to see 
what happening here.” 

“Things quiet,” replied Grendel. 
“How ’bout you?” 



26 



IF 




“Same.” 

“I’m worried up,” Beowulf said. 
“Oh, why?” asked Littlejohn. 
“They be back for sure,” said 
Beowulf, shaking his head, “And 
there not ’nough of us if bunches 
attack us.” 

“Funny,” said Littlejohn, “that’s 
what Ray say, too.” 

T he wind was blowing hard to- 
ward the monsters’ line of march 
as Runner’s warriors drew up in a 
circle around him. 

“The leaper killers that guard the 
giant teve -enters will catch our scent. 
It is borne on the Sharcarrier 
said. 

“Is my name not Runner-with- 
the-Wind?” Runner asked. “The holy 
man has asked the gods of the nav to 
bless us. Let the leaper killers smell 
us. It will be too late for them to 
prevent the holocaust the nav will 
bear to the monsters they protect.” 
He looked at his warriors. Each 
carried a firepot, a shar and a 
whistler. “You know the plan. Go.” 
They dispersed to set the ^ve 
aflame. 

(4T smell them, too,” said 
J. Littlejohn as Mama-san trotted 
over with a warning. “Something up. 
Tell Ray.” 

Mama-san had not gone ten paces 
before she heard Littlejohn cry, 
“Fire!” 

She_ turned to see a wall of flame 
rushing down on them like a tidal 
wave. 



The cholos had to be turned or 
they would head right into the fire. 
By the time they sensed the flame it 
would be upon them. They would 
have no chance at all. 

The dogs leaped into action. Dash- 
ing in close to the cholos, they 
started the beasts turning away from 
the blaze. There was a small chance 
such tactics could save creatures . 

In the van Taylor was first to 
notice the flames. “I’d better get this 
heap moving!” He slipped into the 
control couch. “The dogs will start 
turning the cholos on their own and 
Ray has the hover-scooter.” 

“All right,” said Mary. “I’ll batten 
down any loose material.” 

46T^AMN it!” Ray shouted into 

X-r the wind as he stood between 
the cholos and the van and watched 
the fire sweep closer to the beasts. 

He climbed onto his scooter and 
dashed about, shouting orders at the 
dogs. 

There was enough smoke to ob- 
scure visibility beyond forty or fifty 
meters. Ray failed, in the confusion, 
to consciously note the distant 
figures moving through the smoke 
like shapes flowing across a dream- 
scape. 

Aware now that something was 
wrong, the cholos felt the first tenta- 
tive touch of heat from the flames 
and started to move faster. They 
were no longer eating— they were 
moving away from a danger they as 
yet could recognize only as some- 
thing to be feared. 



PRICE OF HONOR 



27 




Suddenly a jagged streak of light- 
ning tore across the darkening sky, 
followed by a hollow clap of thun- 
der. The wind turned back on itself 
momentarily. The tidal wave of 
flame was checked as if by an in- 
visible dam. Then the dam was 
breached in several places as the wind 
revived, sucking up parts of the fire 
and hurling them forward among 
virgin grasses. 

One of the slower cholos was 
overtaken and enveloped by a sheet 
of flame. Ray heard an incredibly 
deep rumble of sheer terror tear from 
the trapped cholo— the first sound he 
had ever heard a cholo utter. The 
cholo’s pulpy body sizzled and 
popped like that of a fat and juicy 
caterpillar in a campfire. The 
doomed creature writhed in an ago- 
nizing dance of death. 

“Oh, sweet Jesus!” Ray moaned, 
turning away. The smell of burned 
cholo flesh resembled that of charred 
rubber. It reached his nostrils as he 
wheeled his scooter and joined the 
other cholos in their mad retreat 
from the fiery onslaught. He gagged 
but kept driving. 

The dogs were all around him 
now. The cholos, in full flight, 
needed no more urging to run from 
the fire. 

“C’mon, Ray,” Beowulf shouted 
at him. 

“I’m coming, but I want to stay as 
close as possible to the cholos. You 
fellows are faster than the cholos. 
Get ahead where it’s safe.” 

“Okay, Ray. Good luck!” 



Backs rippling, the cholos raced 
across the plain. The dogs had 
pinched them in toward a common 
center and occasionally they would 
collide with and rebound from each 
other as they ran before the wind’s 
hot breath. 

Small animals and an occasional 
antelope and hide cat could be ^en 
among the cholos and dogs. No 
species paid any attention to -any 
other: the fire was common enemy 
to all. 

64T T’S no use,” Taylor told Mary. 

JL“We can’t outrace the fire. I 
remember a deep ravine about two 
kilometers ahead— I’m going to make 
for the bottom. There’s little growing 
there to burn and I’m almost certain 
the van can survive the heat when the 
fire leaps over us.” 

“It sounds good. I only hope that 
Ray is safe.” 

R ay saw the van disappear into 
the ravine and waited for it to 
climb out the other side. When it did 
not reappear he panicked for an 
instant, imagining the van was stuck 
at the bottom. Then he hit upon 
Taylor’s probable plan and approved 
its soundness. 

He refused to look back. He could 
hear, even above the roaring of the 
fire, the death rumbles of the cholos. 

Soon he was . at the ravine. He 
bounced over the lip and guided the 
scooter down the steep side of the 
wall in a kind of controlled skid. He 
hit bottom and almost lost the 



28 



IF 




scooter but managed to keep it up- 
right by sheer muscle. 

He intended to linger in the ravine 
no longer than it would take for him 
to be sure both Mary and Taylor 
were uninjured. He passed slowly in 
front of the windscreen, waving 
madly when the two faces from 
inside pressed up against it. Then the 
scooter lurched as he applied power. 
He was climbing the other side of the 
ravine, not nearly as steep as the side 
he had descended, when something 
about the van’s position occurred to 
him. The cholos . 

He turned just in time to see one 
of the beasts hesitate at the lip of the 
ravine then press forward as a tongue 
of flame licked at it. It tried to inch 
its way down but quickly lost trac- 
tion on the loose soil of the steep 
slope and skidded sidewise. The 
cholo hit a small outcropping of 
rocks, flipped, began to roU. It ca- 
reened to the ravine’s floor and 
smashed into the rear of the van with 
tremendous force. The cholo’s im- 
pact slewed the rear of the van 
around drunkenly; the vehicle struck 
the opposite wall of the ravine and 
overturned. All communication an- 
tennas were shorn off. 

There was nothing Ray could do 
at the moment. Other cholos were 
braving the ravine at various points 
along its length. The fire was right 
behind them. He had to get away, 
praying that Taylor and Mary had 
survived the awful collision. 

In seconds the flames had reached 
the ravine and leaped across it, borne 



by the gusting wind. Ray and the few 
surviving cholos ran before it. 

Again and again lightning crackled 
across the sky, now the hue of dusk. 
The wind began to blow erratically. 
At last heavy drops of water, each 
the size of a small stone, began to 
fall. It was as if the gods were 
weeping for the lost cholos. - 

The rain fell faster. The wind 
shifted, blowing the fire back to- 
wards the devastated earth it had just 
swept bare of all life. A victim of its 
own voracious appetite, the fire now 
had nothing to sustain it and began 
to collapse inward on itself. 

Ray looked about for the dogs. He 
could see only one or two. The 
others, he assumed, were probably 
trying to run down and halt the still 
fleeing cholos that had survived the 
fire. 

He was turning the scooter to head 
back toward the ravine when he 
heard the sound of hoofs. 

ANSON saw the Centaurs rushing in 
on Ray and reacted instantly. 
As he bounded across the prairie he 
saw a bolo-like throwing weapon 
knock Ray from the scooter. The 
sight infuriated him. Now he gave no 
thought to his own safety-a man 
had been attacked! 

His assault was so swift, so silent, 
that they were unaware of it. He was 
in the air, fangs bared, when the 
target Centaur finally turned in 
alarm, exposing his throat to Anson. 

Screaming a battle cry only at the 
last instant, Anson felt his teeth tear 



PRICE OF HONOR 



29 




deeply into the Centaur’s throat. 
Blood filled his mouth and gushed 
between his teeth. 

Knowing the wound he had in- 
flicted was fatal, Anson charged a 
second Centaur. By this time the 
others were aware that death was 
among them. Anson no sooner had 
his fangs in his second victim’s throat 
than he felt the first spear enter his 
back. Its only effect was to make 
him bite down harder, the better to 
force the life out of this bedamned 
creature that had dared attack his 
master. More spears pierced his body. 
He felt his jaws release his mortally 
wounded prey. 

“I have obeyed the law!” Anson 
howled as the leader of the Centaurs 
drove a final spear through the scout 
dog’s heart. 

44 T) LEASE hurry. I can’t stand 

JL it!” 

“I’ll just be a few seconds more,” 
Taylor promised. “There.” He 
stepped back from the side of the 
convulsively heaving cholo with an 
odd sense of achievement. “The 
charge is implanted. Let’s get back 
now.” 

Mary followed him to the over- 
turned van. He picked up a small 
black box . and took one last look at 
the suffering cholo. It was the same 
one that had disabled the van. The 
beast was burned terribly and be- 
yond recovery. Taylor was about to 
help it in the only way he knew. 

“Here we go,” he said as he 
pressed the firing stud. The dying 



cholo seemed to rise several feet into 
the air as if by levitation. Then a 
loud whoomp reached their ears and 
the huge creature broke apart 
raggedly at its middle. 

“Thank Zen,” murmured Mary. 
“That’s just one. We’ve got 
twenty-four more to worry about— 
and nine dogs and one Ray.” 

“Let’s get started.” 

Taylor followed her to the top of 
the ravine. The view was not es- 
pecially pretty. Across the gulf, in 
the direction from which they had 
come, the land lay scorched and raw. 
Wisps of smoke still rose from the 
fire-blackened soil. Tiny flames flick- 
ered, hissing as they tried unsuccess- 
fully to embrace unburned patches 
of grass still heavy with water from 
the brief but furious cloudburst that 
had doused the blaze. Dotted ob- 
scenely across the hellish landscape 
were the charred remains of more 
than half a dozen of the cholos- 
losers in the race against wind-driven 
flames. The cooked flesh still popped 
and split, oozing a colorless mucus 
that made the cholos resemble 
glistening slugs emergent upon a 
wasted abdomen after journeying 
through moist entrails. 

Mary gagged, dropped to her knees 
and vomited in convulsive heaves. 

Taylor bent, stroked her shoul- 
ders. “Are you all right?” 

“Oh, sure!” she ^napped back. 
“Never better.” She dabbed at the 
corners of her mouth with a handker- 
chief. 

“You’re going to lie down a 



30 



IF 




while,” Taylor ordered. He helped 
her up. They scrambled back to the 
van. 

Wind whistled through the 
shattered windows. New Kansas 
seemed a hopelessly long way from 
Earth. The night’s incoming tide of 
darkness flowed silently across the 
prairie and they felt weirdly alone. 

T AYLXDR patted the small mound 
a few last times with his shovel 
and stepped back. 

He felt awkward as usual with the 
dogs and uncertain about how to 
begin. “I didn’t know-ah— Anson all 
that well, only through the work he 
did for us. But based on that alone, 
I’m well aware of what a fine and 
loyal member of our crew he was. He 
recognized his duty and he did it- 
even at the cost of his life.” He 
smiled wanly. “Anson is one of New 
Kansas’ first colonists. His body will 
give nourishment to a soil which will 
one day grow Terran plants.” 

Beowulf looked up at Taylor, his 
expressive dog’s face lined with 
sorrow. “Thank you, Taylor.” There 
was a pause. “We want to be ’lone 
with Anson now, okay?” 

“Sure. I understand.” Taylor 
swung the folding shovel to his shoul- 
der and turned back to the camp he 
and Mary had set up near the van. 

'^The dogs surrounded the small 
grave and lay down, heads on paws, 
staring silently at Anson’s final rest- 
ing place. They possessed no tele- 
pathic powers but, like all scout 
dogs, were markedly empathetic to 



each other’s moods and to subtle 
shadings of feeling. Their intelli- 
gence, artificially augmented, was 
secondary to their emotions. The 
idea might seem ludicrous, even dis- 
tasteful, to someone not acquainted 
with scout dogs, but it was remark- 
ably easy for a sensitive human to 
love— almost to be in love with— the 
dogs he or she worked with. 

The pain they experienced now 
from the loss of Anson was intensi- 
fied by the fear they felt for the 
safety of the missing Ray. In a way, 
Anson’s death was easier to deal 
with-it had a finality to it. But 
about Ray they did not know how to 
feel. Hope seesawed with despair. 
And, though it was in no way de- 
served, they blamed themselves for 
the apparent loss of Ray. 

Beowulf rose stiff-leggedly to his 
feet. “Let us recite the Law.” 

“What is the Law?” 

“Tb stand by man side, as dogs 
have always stood. ” 

“What is the Law?” 

“7b place duty above self, honor 
above life. ” 

“What is the Law?” 

“7b allow harm to come to no 
man, to protect man and his posses- 
sions. ” 

“What is the Law?” 

*To stand by man *s side-as dogs 
will always stand. ” 

Beowulf looked mournfully at the 
other dogs, especially Ozma, and 
added, “Honor be Anson’s— ’cause he 
obeyed the Law. Shame be ours— 
’cause we did not.”

Then Beowulf raised his muzzle to 
the brooding sky and voiced a long, 
drawn-out wolfs howl of sorrow. 
One by one the others joined him. 

The chill wind took up the mourn- 
ful cry. 

V 

R unner had never had a slave 
before, so it was with some 
difficulty that he approached the 
problem of deciding just what to do 
with the two-legged one. There was 
the question of how to guard him 
adequately, too. Actually that task 
was made simpler by several factors. 
First, the slave seemed unaggres- 
sive— was “he” perhaps a female—and 
unlikely to attempt to harm any of 
the shaman or children? Further, the 
slave was unaware of where he was 
and any escape he effected could 
only be an escape to death. Runner 
thought that no escape at all. 

When the slave had first awakened. 
Runner had decided to permit him to 
be freed to the extent of wearing a 
rope collar tied to a post near 
Runner’s hut. After noting that the 
slave took his meals calmly and 
peacefully-he ate leaper meat with 
relish— Runner agreed to Sunchaser’s 
proposal that he be permitted to 
roam free of the collar while under 
observation. Sunchaser, as it turned 
out, kept the slave under her eye 
most of the day, feeding him and 
patiently showing him the camp. 

Runner was skeptical, but accord- 
ing to Sunchaser the slave quickly 



learned the meaning of nav, sha, shot, 
shamon, shaman, teve, gnur and 
other common words. The slave - 
seemed quick-witted enough. Runner 
mused. 

T he van had been righted and the 
antennas crudely repaired by the 
time the persistent winds reached 
gale force. Taylor and Mary had 
rounded up most of the cholos and 
led them to the shelter of a ridge of 
low hills. The dogs were still search- 
ing for a trace of Ray. 

“Vaslev?” Taylor firmly held 
down the “receive” button as the 
communicator crackled and hissed. 
He was rewarded by the tinny- 
sounding voice of Vaslev Khorsegai, 
another group leader. 

“Yeah, Taylor, whaf s up?” 

“I’m afraid we’ve had some 
trouble.” Taylor took a deep breath 
and described the events of the pre- 
ceding few days. 

“Whew. Sounds bad, Taylor. Just 
what do you want us to do?” 

“I’m not sure— though I know Ray 
must be found if he’s still alive.” 
“Well, I can call some of the other 
groups and see what we can do.” 
“Fine. Actually, until the dogs 
have some idea of where he is, 
Vaslev, I guess nothing much can be 
accomplished. 

“I know. The Bureau has pretty 
much left us to our own resources. 
But we’ll do something. We have to 
band together in the face of any 
trouble from the Centaurs or we’ll go 
down one by one.”

IF 




R AY’S background in anthropol- 
ogy meant much to him during 
the first few days as a captive. Within 
hours of waking up a prisoner of the 
Centaurs he had learned that the 
chief of this “tribe” was called Sola- 
minov— or “Runner-with-the-Wind”— 
and that the Centaurs thought of 
themselves as “the people.” As a 
two-legged monster Ray knew he did 
not qualify as a real person to them 
but they were remarkably unhostile. 
One of the chieftain’s young 
wives, Sunchaser, had taken his “edu- 
cation” in hand and was responsible 
for hastening the process of familiar- 
izing him with the Centaur language. 
With a few root words to build on 
Ray discovered that the speech 
patterns of the Centaurs were not so 
far removed fromrmany of the other 
“primitive” languages he had studied 
at the University of Brazil. 

Just as Eskimos on Earth had had 
more than a dozen words to describe 
the many kinds of snow contained 
within the framework of their daily 
lives so, too, did the Centaurs appear 
to have upward of thirty different 
forms to describe the various kinds 
of grasses that might be encountered. 

For instance, mehteve was “thick 
grass.” Yoteve was “tall grass.” Shar- 
teve was “cutting grass.” Gnurteve 
was “hide-cat grass.” 

Further, there were more than ten 
different words describing types of 
wind in the Centaur vocabulary, 

Ray was especially intrigued to 
learn that the same word that meant 
wives also meant booty —shaman. 



He began to talk with Sunchaser 
as he became more fluent in the 
Centaur tongue. She learned as much 
about him as he did about her and 
her culture. 

“Are all your people deformed?” 
she asked him one day. 

“Deformed?” 

“You have only two legs.” 

“Oh. Yes. Though* a four-legged 
man would be the deformed one in 
my land.” 

“How strange.” 

“Yes.” Then: “Did you speak to 
Runner about what I told you?” 

“I did.” 

“And?” 

“He says he will not speak with a 
slave.” 

“But it may mean the end of your 
people if you cannot see that we 
mean you no harm!” 

“If you mean us no harm, why do 
your monsters eat our teve andrleave 
only poison behind?” 

“There is much land here. We only 
want to share it with you.” 

“Runner says you cannot share 
what is not yours.” 

At that Ray fell silent. 

T he wind howled constantly 
and Ray found it difficult to 
sleep more than ten minutes at a 
time. Again he shifted position under 
the rude leaper blanket. Nervously he 
fingered the knife sheath at his belt. 
At first he had been incredulous that 
Runner would permit him to retain 
his knife, but then this was a society 
based on honor and honor dictated

that a warrior, even a prisoner, keep 
his sha. 

Ray kept imagining that a hide 
cat—he still could not think of them 
as gnwrs— was stealthily creeping up 
on him but reminded himself con- 
stantly that Runner always posted 
guards. Still . 

Some time later, he did not know 
when, he heard a noise. Almost 
afraid to move, he slowly turned his 
head. 

“Ga-a-a wha-a-a?” asked a pint- 
sized Centaur. Ray chuckled in. relief. 
It was Runner’s first-born son. Ray 
knew him well enough— the young- 
ster was fascinated by Ray and 
followed him everywhere. 

‘‘Hey, you’d better get back to 
your hut before your mom misses 
you, little Runner.” 

“Ka-a-a-a-” 

“I said—” Ray stopped short when 
he saw the large shape materializing 
out of the night. It was a hide cat. A 
big one. 

“Beat it, kid,” said Ray softly, 
pulling his knife and stepping in 
front of the youngster. The hide cat 
snarled and advanced. 

The child, panicked, ran for his 
hut. His motion attracted the hide 
cat. Ray swore as the cat started 
toward the boy. 

“Hey! "Here!” he shouted, but to 
no avail. The cat obviously had his 
mouth set for a Centaur. It 
studiously ignored Ray. ' 

“Okay, bastard!” 

Ray intercepted the cat’s rush and 
jumped on its back, grabbing one ear 



and locking his legs around the cat’s 
lean body. That caught the cat's 
attention, all right— especially when 
he drove his knife into its throat. The 
animal leaped straight into the air 
and landed hard. 

Clinging desperately to the cat’s 
ear Ray simultaneously told himself 
that he was nuts and that this was no 
time for pride. “Help!” he yelled at 
the top of his lungs. 

Shapes started pouring from the 
huts but he had no time to enjoy the 
results of his cry. He was too busy 
knifing the cat in neck and shoulder 
with one hand while hanging on with 
the other. 

The cat changed tactics and 
whirled suddenly. Ray found himself 
flying through the air— minus his 
knife, which remained stuck in the 
cat’s neck. 

This is it, he thought as the cat 
turned on him, fangs bared. It 
bunched to spring, then looked 
puzzled. It was puzzled by the 
sudden sprouting of a half-dozen 
spears in its back and sides. The cat 
made a weak mewing sound and 
toppled, blood gushing from multiple 
wounds. 

Ray saw Runner staring down at 
him, looking concerned. “Thanks, 
Runner,” he said, then passed out.

the camp. “Ray in there.” 

“Think we ought rush them?” 
asked Sinbad.

“Oh, sure— and get Ray killed 
plenty quick,” snapped Beowulf. 
“No, we tell Taylor we found him. 
Taylor know what to do.” 



44*^f[^OU’VE learned our tongue 
X quickly,” Runner said to- 
Ray. The other council members 
nodded assent. 

Ah, Ray told himself. Runner 
is the only one I need really consider. 
The others will follow his lead with- 
out much question. Aloud he said, “I 
was trained in my land to do so.” 

“I see.” Runner paused. “I must 
again thank you for saving my son’s 
life. You could have been killed. Why 
did you not try to save yourself?” 

“I— and my people— mean you no 
harm. I could not allow a child to die 
when it was in my power to prevent 
it.” 

“I believe what you say. But what 
of the rest of your people? Can you 
speak for them?” 

‘T think so. If you and I can agree 
to go our ways in peace, will not all 
our people follow? I am sure they 
will, for no one wants a useless, 
wasteful conflict. Is it part of the 
warrior’s code of your people to die 
for nothing?” 

“Of course not. If it is a peace 
with honor that you offer, then, for 
my people’s sake, I must make a 
covenant with you. What do your 
people do to signify an agreement?” 

“We grasp hands.” 

The two did so. 

“Good,” Runner said. “I will dis- 



patch several warriors to guard you 
on your way back to—” 

The Centaur leader was inter- 
rupted by the sound of energy rifles. 

“What-oh my God!” said Ray. 
Together he and Runner joined the 
council members rushing outside. 

The camp was in an uproar. Scout 
dogs dashed from hut to hut, looking 
for Ray. Men on hoover-scooters, 
men he did not recognize, were 
careening through the camp firing at 
anything that moved. 

“No!” he screamed, but saw Gnur- 
killer fall, his face gone. To his right 
Littlejohn and Frodo brought down 
a Centaur and ripped out his throat. 
Ray rushed in their direction. 

Sunchaser was running after him. 
“Make them stop before it’s too 
late!” 

^ “I’ll try.” Behind him some of the 
huts were going up in flames. 

As he turned back to the at- 
tackers, he heard Ozma shout, “Ray! 
We’U save you!” 

“Wait. I-” 

Ozma streaked past him and 
leaped for Sunchaser. The scout dog, 
though a female, easily outweighed 
the slight Centaur and knocked her 
over on impact. 

“No! You don’t understand!” Ray 
screamed hoarsely as he tried to pull 
Ozma from the frantically jerking 
body of Sunchaser. 

Suddenly he went limp. He’d seen n 
the life go out of Sunchaser’s eyes. 
“Why, why?” 

Ozma laughed cruelly. “They kill 
Anson.” 



PRICE OF HONOR

“But she was a female, not a 
warrior.” 

“Taylor say kill everyone till save 
you. Must be taught lesson.” 

“God— oh, God!” Ray heard two 
hover-scooters pull up on either side 
of him. He felt himself grasped under 
each arm and lifted into the air. 

“Don’t worry, buddy,” a strange 
voice was saying. “You’re safe.” 

“Yeah-safe.” 

In that way he was carried away 
from the camp and returned from 
savagery to civilization. 



T he wind was still strong 
though the time of the winds 
was nearly past. Ray and the dogs 
walked slowly across the prairie, 
heading into the wind. 

“We’re sorry for what we done, 
Ray.” 

“It’s not your fault, Beowulf.” 
“Yah, but-” 

“No buts.” 

“Okay. Think they will take 
you-us— back?” 

“I don’t know.” He smiled grimly. 
“I suppose you and the others heard 
the argument I had with Mary and 
Taylor about what we’re doing. I 
can’t blame them. I once believed 
everything they still believe— that the 
Centaurs will have lands set aside for 
them for all time by the Bureau and 
that the colonists will honor the deal. 
But ‘all time’ will give way when the 
colonists need- more room or when 
something valuable is discovereid on 
the Centaur land. I can’t accept that. 



I have to try to help them. They 
need someone on their side who 
knows what’s happening to them.” 

They were silent after that, each 
alone with his thoughts as they 
trudged toward the ruined camp. 

Eventually the camp came into 
view. Ray slowed down the dogs and 
they walked warily toward the cen- 
ter. When they were within three 
hundred meters of the camp Ray saw 
Runner emerge from his hut and 
stand impassively in front of it. 

Ray approached to within fifty 
meters. Then he stopped and made a 
great show of letting his energy rifie 
fall to the ground. Runner remained 
impassive. 

Again Ray started forward, the 
dogs following at his heels. Fmally 
Ray came to a stop directly in front 
of Runner. Runner stared into Ray’s 
face, the Centaur’s eyes refusing to 
betray his emotions. 

Ray thought of Runner’s responsi- 
bility to his tribe and hoped he 
would put its future ahead of per- 
sonal feelings. But the human could 
not help thinking of Gnurkiller, of 
Sunchaser, and of the sorrow Runner 
must be bearing. 

Ray very deliberately raised his 
right fist to his forehead in a salute, 
presenting his unprotected chest to 
Runner. Runner would raise his shar 
either to return the salute or to 
plunge his weapon into Ray’s chest. 

Runner and Ray stared into each 
other’s eyes as the wind blew. 

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the 
shar moved ... •

HOW TO 
BLOW UP 
AN ASTEROID 

Only a band of bold spacemen stood 
between Earth and final catastrophe! 



DUNCAN LUNAN 




E arth had been a member of 
the Interface interstellar civiliza- 
tion for four years. There were things 
to show for it, including a major 
spaceport functioning in Montana 
and a joint Human/Fallaran project 
thriving on the moons of Jupiter. 
Not bad, although still the only true 
spaceship available was a Recovery 
and liaison Vehicle left behind by 
the Sasarenn, reptilian foes of the 
Interface, dislodged from the Solar 
System in 2081. It would be many 
months yet before Earth’s prototype 
starships got airborne. 

On the whole those first four years 
had been quiet, considering that all 
the member races of the Interface 
could have descended on the Solar 
System once the matter-transmitter 
relays were placed in their various 
orbits. Yet for McKay, involuntary 
Planetary Agent since the Sasarenn 
confrontation, the period had been 
busy enough and so had passed 
quickly. Even in human terms, four 
years is not a long time. In astro- 
nomical terms it is negligible. 

Of course a year or two later, 
when Earth would make definite 
contact with some unscrupulous 
members of the Interface, McKay 
was to wonder if the advent of the 
body designated 2085-JA hadT)een 
coincidence after all... 

He was a long way from the field 
when the emergency arose. The swift 
reaction of his team proved that 
despite its many responsibilities, it 
"still recognized that the RLV was 
primarily a rescue vehicle. 



McKay was walking along axoun- 
try road when the communications 
relay implanted in his skull by the 
Sasarenn handed him the punch in 
the back of the head. Those punches 
seemed to get more vicious as he 
grew older. McKay recovered his 
breath and pulled out his RLV com- 
municator. “Acknowledge.” * 

He stood motionless, the land- 
scape around him “annihilated” as 
the perception circuit gave him the 
read-out from the computer on the 
orbiting space station. Though he 
had never stressed the point in pub- 
lic, Interface membership gave ^th 
some coverage against the random 
hazards of the Universe— and the 
hazard now coming in from the stars 
was one unknown to Earth for geo- 
lo^cal ages. This McKay learned 
from the read-out. Immediately he 
opened a communications channel 
overriding radio chitchat around the 
sfpacefield. 

“McKay to all units, absolute 
priority. RLV team to ship, repeat, 
RLV team to ship. Divert all traffic 
away from the field and the Interface 
corridor. Clear all Committee for 
Earth’s Defense channels for a 
planetwide alert Go!” He plugged 
back into the space station and began 
preparations. 

Exactly three minutes later, Sla- 
zeck called him from the ship. 
“We’re standing by to lift, Mac, but , 
one of our trainees reported sick this 
morning. I don’t think it’s too 
serious— want me to spring him?” 

“Negative,” McKay radioed. 

IF

“Take off immediately and home on 
my relay. This one’s our biggest 
emergency ever!” 

ffe returned his perceptions to the 
station. When he came back to 
reality the scream of the approaching 
RLV was all around him. The ship 
was coming down STOL, wings wide- 
spread, flaps and gear down. McKay 
raised the communicator again. 
“Don’t land. Just drop me a line.” 
“Acknowledge.” Slazeck was at the 
controls. He brought the ship to the 
hover, the hot jets beating down and 
boxing McKay. A silvery pick-up line 
spiraled down from the airlock in the 
underside. McKay slipped into the 
harness and was winched swiftly 
aloft. It was a good trick to stay clear 
of the Jetstream and get in this way 
without banging your head, and 
McKay wasn’t wearing a helmet. But 
he made it without mishap. Slazeck 
climbed the ship toward the Inter- 
face corridor as McKay changed into 
flight overalls. 

\ Arnold, the Air Force trainee, was 
with Devlin in the cabin. So too, 
unexpectedly, was Devlin’s wife 
Cathy. Mcl^y blurted, “What are 
you doing here?” 

“You didn’t say this is a contact 
mission,” replied Cathy, hurt. “So I 
dropped everything and ran for the 
ship like everyone else.” 

“Okay. Sorry, Cathy. You’ll have 
to stick with us as far as the satel- 
lite— there isn’t time to return you to 
the field.” He pulled himself through 
the hatch into the cockpit, dropping 
into the copilot’s seat.

“We’re in the Interface corridor,” 
Slazeck told him, plugging into the 
computer-autopilot. “Shall I circle 
while you put out your broadcast?” 
“No, hold your climb,” said 
McKay. “We’ll put out a global warn- 
ing from the space station.” He 
contacted the orbital Interface relay 
and set the controls to place the ship 
by the station, velocities matched. 
“Up Interface!” 



AHEAD of the ship, spectacular in 
J\^ the perception circuits’ all- 
around vision, a circle of blackness 
appeared. Half a mile across, two- 
dimensional, the disk looked into

space six thousand miles up. The jets 
thrust the RLV into it and died 
instantly, momentum carrying their 
last gulp of air out of the exhausts in 
a cloud of ice crystals. The blue disk 
astern closed, leaving them in Earth’s 
shadow. 

Visible through the forward ports, 
a giant wheel floated serenely. The 
space station. 

“Twelve minutes from alert to 
orbit,” said Slazeck. “But for picking 
you up, we’d have done it in six.” 
“Every second counts,” McKay 
assured him. “Go ahead and dock, 
Walt, while I start the briefing.” His 
own display told him everyone on 
board was plugged in. “It’s a radar 
alert, crew. The satellite picked it up 
and rang all the alarms. Unknown 
space object. I’m bringing it up now 
on the display.” 

“Got it,” said Devlin. 

“That speck?” Cathy asked care- 
fully, concealing her incredulity. 

“ That speck’ is nearly one-and-a- 
half million miles out,” said McKay. 
“There’s a radar beam locked on it 
now, but it was first detected on a 
routine sweep of surrounding space. 
'Diat’s like when the old BMEWS 
system picked up the moon by acci- 
dent. To show up at that distance, 
the thing out there has to be really 
big. And it’s coming our way. It’s on 
a collision course with Earth!” 

“You mean it’s too big to burn up 
in the atmosphere?” 

“If it’s as big as it looks, that 
object won’t even feel the atmos- 
phere,” said McKay. “But the atmos- 



phere will feel the object, all right. 
There’ll be enough hard radiation 
from the entry alone to threaten 
millions of people.” 

Whatever their personal reactions 
to that news, the team members 
conscientiously showed no emotion. 

“It could be a mile across,” Devlin 
read from the computer. “A full- 
grown asteroid— and not one of the 
Earth-grazefs, on that orbit.” 

“Right. Looks as if it’s come from 
clear outside the solar system—” 
“Nosing into the docking collar, 
Mac,” Slazeck reported. 

“Okay, we’ll continue this con- 
ference in the station. Cathy, follow 
me to the control room. We’ve got to 
put out that alert.” 

By now the international channels 
were cleared, waiting impatiently to 
hear the nature of the threat. In the 
control module of the space station,' 
McKay studied the latest read-outs 
from its sensory systems. Meanwhile 
Cathy contacted the U.N. head- 
quarters of the Committee for 
Earth’s Defense. Next, she switched 
the translators into the circuit for the 
international broadcast. Then McKay 
took over and told the world, 
through its military warning systems, 
what was coming. 

“The impact will be in the western 
hemisphere, some way north of the 
equator.” he finished. “The exact 
dimensions and constitution of the 
asteroid are unknown. Taking the 
most pessimistic view, the effects of 
the impact may be disastrous for 
every nation on Earth. We’ve sent

IP 




out message spheres calling for Falla- 
ran help but warships may not get 
here in time. All emergency services 
should be mobilized at once. Prepara- 
tions must be made for a major 
catastrophe.” 

He switched off. The rest of the 
team was now crowded into the 
weightless control room of the satel- 
lite. 

*TVe scrambled up the corridor,” 
McKay said, “because it seems to me 
that we’re the only ones who can do 
anything about this. If anybody can 
think of a definite, sure-fire plan 
involving gear or personnel we don’t 
have, we’ve got just over one hour to 
do something about it.” 

No suggestions came up. After a 
moment Arnold said, “Did I under- 
stand you to say eight hours to 
impact?” 

“Eight hours, yes.” McKay 
glanced at his watch. “Nearer seven- 
and-a-half, now. But to do anything 
about it we have to get out to the 
asteroid. It’s making more than forty 
miles a second right now and will be 
doing nearer fifty by impact. So we 
can get to it only by Interface-and 
the range of an Interface relay is ten 
thousand miles. I’ve sacrificed one of 
Earth’s three relays for the purpose, 
hurling it out to meet the asteroid at 
300 miles per second, so they’ll pass 
in a little more than an hour. That 
leaves us only six hours, probably, by 
the time we get down on the 
asteroid— but that 300 mps is near an 
absolute limit in this situation. Much 
faster, and the relay couldn’t hold 



the range for the normal thirty 
seconds’ duration of an Interface. 
Our timing will have to be perfect as 
it is.. .this is the narrowest launch slot 
I ever heard of.” 

“What can we do when we get 
there? There’s no way to divert a 
rock like that from Earth, is there?” 

“1 can’t think of one,” McKay 
replied. “If it’s a mile across, it’s too 
big to go through an Interface. Some- 
how we’ve got to break it up. We 
won’t be able to destroy it but if we 
can shatter it, the collision will do 
less damage.” 

Slazeck spoke. “Suppose we cap’t 
split it up. Just how bad will the 
crash be, Mac?” 

“I have some assessments from the 
computer here. As I said, just falling 
through the atmosphere, that baby 
can generate enou^ hard radiation 
to sterilize a huge area. It could be 
enough to kill all exposed life in 
line-of-sight. Adding the effects of 
the actual impact, the amount of 
energy that will be let loose, there 
might be no survivors at all from 
Paraguay well up into Canada. Be- 
yond that radius there will still be

radiated back into space. If it’s in the

atmosphere. Tidal waves will scour

all the low ground in the world. 
There could be enough water-vapor 
and sohds lifted into the atmosphere 
to bring back the ice age. And if the 
damn thing’s really massive, coming 
at this speed, I suppose there’s a 
chance it could break. up the Earth’s 
rocky crust altogether.” 

The picture of total cataclysm 
drawn by McKay was reflected in the 
horror stamped on everyone’s face, 
including his own. It was a paralyzing 
moment. 

He was the first to regain control 
of himself; after all, he had faced 
planetary disaster ' before. Slazeck 
and Devlin, responding to their long 
training and the steely self-command 
of their chief, managed to pull them- 
selves together. Cathy, so as not to 
break down her husband, managed to 
fight back her tears. Only Arnold, 
the trainee, could not seem to break 
out of his horrified trance. McKay 
did not^blame him. How awful to 
contemplate was the po^ible end of 
Earth and all its life. 

Slazeck decided that the silence 
had to be broken. 

“You’d need pretty high density 
to crack the crust,” he growled. 

“Oh, sure— I’m just mentioning the 
worst possibilities I can think of. We 
don’t know yet what the object is 
made of. I’m hoping it’s pretty light. 
The observations we have from the 
lunar relay suggest it has a high 
albedo on parts of its surface. If what 
we have is a loose ball of ice and 
pumice out of some comet, it’s much 
less of a threat.” 



“And we could break up some- 
thing like that?” 

“Quite likely. Two of our missiles 
have nuclear warheads. I’m won- 
dering about taking more along, but 
that would crowd out our rescue 
equipment. I think we should keep 
the stuff aboard in case we have to 
make a landing.” 

Slazeck nodded. “Unless the 
thing’s really fragile, we’ll have to 
plant our charges below the surface.” 

“That’s what I have in mind. The 
RLV’s carrying cutting tools as well 
as explosives for use with the rescue 
systems. I think we’ve got to save the 
world with what’s aboard right 
now.” 

Cathy had blown her nose a 
couple of times. She decided she 
could trust her voice. 

“So you’re going out through 
Interface, to ride the asteroid back 
in?” 

“That’s it, Cathy. Of course we’ll 
have to use Interface to get off 
again.” 

“Why did you stop at this satellite, 
chief?” 

“To get a look at the main com- 
puters. To get ourselves a few 
minutes of conference before we 
committed the ship to deep space. 
And mostly, Cathy, to deposit you. 
You’ll be safer here.” 

“But you’ll be gone only a few 
hours,” she said. “Not long enough 
for me to get in your way. It sounds 
as if I ought to go with you. Look, 
you’ll need coffee.” 

“Hell’s beUs-” McKay began. 



42 



IF 




“Chief, you know I make a mean 
cup of coffee, ” the girl wheedled. 

McKay’s attention seemed else- 
where, just for a second, as if he had 
plugged into the perception circuits. 
“All right,” he said, snapping out of 
it. “You can come. Let’s get back to 
the ship. Walt, you help me put these 
controls back on automatic.” 

As they too were leaving, Slazeck 
shook his head grimly. 

“A mean cup of coffee?” 
“Just a thou^t, Walt,” McKay 
said. “True, I don’t like to take 
Cathy into space, even for liaison 
missions. But there’s a finite chance 
that the object will be dense enough, 
formed outside the solar system as it 
was, to chum up the whole crust of 
Earth with shockwaves. If that’s 
going to happen we have to save at 
least one woman-and there aren’t 
any girls on the Jupiter project.” 
“We’d probably decide not to con- 
tinue the human race.” 

“Even so, Cathy should be saved 
for Devlin— and I’m glad, Walt, that 
the rest of us are bachelors.” 

II 

T he connecting tunnel to the 
docking boom was withdrawn, 
the lock door closed. The RLV 
backed out of the tangential collar 
into the glory of the sunrise. Slowly, 
as the white sun separated from the 
planet, the ship drew away and 
turned into the plane of the orbit. 

McKay fed the parameters for the 
Interface into the computer well in 



advance. When the time came the 
link would be set up automatically. 

The last few minutes seemed eter- 
nal. Nobody could forget that once 
they reached the asteroid, time 
would be desperately short. But at 
last came the thirty-second warning. 

“Activate,” ordered McKay. 

The display traced the outline of 
the Interface ahead. The chemical 
motors fired, thrusting the RLV 
smoothly through the invisible disk. 
There was no change in attitude. The 
stars did not move. But the Earth 
disappeared and came back as a 
distant blue-green crescent. The 
moon flicked across the heavens, 
shrinking and changing phase. And 
out of nowhere, looming like a shape 
from a nightmare, came 2085-JA. 

There was a pause of two or three 
seconds during which the Interface 
closed again. The relay hurtled on 
out of range, and the RLV’s parabola 
swung round and locked on Earth. 
McKay took observations and* read- 
ings for at least three minutes. Then 
he cleared his throat and broadcast 
his description to the waiting planet. 

“It could be worse, but not by 
much. Nickel-iron. Roughly spheri- 
cal, though there’s a pronounced 
ridge like a shoulder on the side 
nearest us. It’s overlaid with ice in 
ridges and peaks, an intricate pattern 
that looks built up by accretion. It 
has little or no rotation relative to 
the sun, so there’s a big clear patch 
on that side of it. The patch is black 
and glistening. Looks pretty solid. 
Around it the ice ridges facing the 



HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



43 




sun are vaporizing, so the asteroid is 
dragging a faint cometary tail-very 
faint. We’re going to take stock of 
what we can do, now that we see the 
thing.” 

Another pause, not all due to the 
time lag between the asteroid and 
Earth. 

At last the voice of Earth came 
back. “RLV, can you estimate the 
size of the body?” 

“Approximately one mile in di- 
ameter,” said McKay. “Likely a core 
fragment from some split planet. It 
must mass billions of tons.” 

The Earth authorities did not 
reply. Confirmation of their fears, 
apparently, had stunned them. 

“Well,” said Slazeck suddenly, 
“we’re coming down toward six 
hours to impact. I take it we’re going 
to sink charges?” 

“Right,” said McKay. “But where? 
That^ear patch looks big enough for 
a good spread of microphones. If we 
can pass seismic shocks through it 
and triangulate, maybe the computer 
can trace the asteroid’s inner struc- 
ture. From that we can calculate the 
best charge locations. Walt, suit up 
and we’ll put you down there. You 
too, Dev.” 

The RLV being designed as a 
rescue ship, its g-couches were excep- 
tionally versatile. With acceleration 
shielding closed around them, they 
could be separated from the ship’s 
life-support and passed out through 
the side hatches as air-cushion sleds 
or stretchers. In space, they could 
serve well for ship-to-ship transfers, 



so why not for ship-to-asteroid trans- 
fers? 

As McKay was edging the ship 
toward the black patch on the sun- 
ward side of the asteroid Slazeck and 
Devlin put on their suits and broke 
out the microphone equipment. 
They opened the lock, and he guided 
two sleds down the hull to them. 

“You’ll need the sleds to land in 
this gravity. It’s low enough to be 
deceptive-about 0.001 -g. I’m keep- 
ing the ship well out till we pick a 
touchdown site, so you’ve got the 
honor of making the first landing on 
the beast. Ready?” 

“Affirmative.” 

To save time, the two were taking 
along explosives and one big nuclear 
warhead. Festooned with equipment, 
the two cockleshells drew away from 
the ship, wending slowly and care- 
fully down to meet their shadows on 
the shiny surface. 

“You’re right about this gravity, 
Mac,” Devlin reported over his radio 
as they began to unload. “Things 
bounce right up. You grab above 
them because you think they’re 
weightless.” 

Looking down from a safe dis- 
tance, McKay could see their diffi- 
culty. On almost every step they rose 
off the surface and had to wait for 
gravity to pull them back. 

“Suggest you stockpile your 
equipment right there, Walt. Then 
you can use the sleds to pay out the 
microphone cables. We’re down to 
five hours thirty...” 

“Will do. Mack.” 



44 



IF 




McKay watched until the first two 
niikes were in position. 

“For once, we could really use 
magnetic-soled boots,” Slazeck re- 
ported. 

“We’ll make a note for the next 
time this happens, maybe in a few 
hundred megayears. While you’re 
putting out the third mike, Walt, I’ll 
move the ship to the far side of the 
asteroid. I’ll throw a communications 
relay halfway around so we can still 
hear each other.” 

“Roger, we copy.” 

S MILING at the old-fashioned 
phrase, McKay turned the ship. 
He was still holding the ' RLV well 
out from the asteroid in order not to 
be snared by the tug of its mass. He 
knew by experience not to mistake 
low gravity for no gravity. It might 
almost be easier to get an orbit 
around the thing, he thought, as he 
edged the ship along the icy bulk. In 
fact, Arnold suggested just that. 

“No. One burst on the attitude 
control jets could slam us right into 
it, if I went that close.” 

At the halfway mark McKay 
launched the com repeater, nudging 
it gently outward at just over escape 
velocity. Above the dark side, setting 
the autopilot to compensate for the 
coming recoil, he deployed the guns 
above and below the hull. 

Reflections of the muzzle flashes 
could just be seen in the dark ice. 
“Firing one. ..firing two. ..firing 
three.. .firing four...” The shells burst 
inadequately on the asteroid, 



suddenly giving scale to its bulk. 
Chips of ice flew and cracks radiated, 
but the overall effect was negligible. 

“Doesn’t look like enough,” 
McKay said to Arnold. 

“I remember an Air Force attempt 
to bomb an iceberg, sir,” said the 
trainee. “Ice can absorb a lot of 
explosive energy. And it’s the metal 
underlying it that’s our real prob- 
lem.” 

A few moments later Devlin re- 
ported. The microphones had picked 
up vibrations generated by the shells. 
But the tremors had been too' weak 
to reveal anything about the aster- 
oid’s structure. 

“I’m going to try a missile,” 
McKay announced. “Better hope it 
works. We’ve only got four.” 

The missile bay had been left open 
after the withdrawal of the first 
nuclear warhead. McKay rolled the 
ship a quarter-turn and fired one of 
the conventional-warhead missiles. 

It streaked toward the asteroid, 
picking up speed fast, and made a 
satisfying explosion. Clearly it had 
penetrated the ice. This time Slazeck 
and Devlin reported a definite shock 
underfoot, enough to lift them off 
the surface for a second, and the 
computer went into its analysis pro- 
gram. 

Numbers and geometrical figures 
danced on the color display, dissolv- 
ing to a 3-D rotating model of the 
asteroid’s interior. Stress lines were 
defined. McKay guessed that maybe 
it had been liberated from its planet 
of origin by the impact of some 



HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



45 




similar wanderer; such was its den- 
sity, it must have been under great 
heat and pressure. The ice must have 
formed over it in space, perhaps by 
accretion over billions of years, or 
from water vaporized by the original 
cataclysm. 

The computer pushed straight on 
to plot the asteroid’s destruction. 
The first solution, a hundred percent 
certain, involved placing both nuclear 
warheads near the center. The appa- 
ratus kept calculating possible loca- 
tions. McKay shut it off when it 
pinpointed two spots respectively ten 
and fifteen feet below the surface. 

“We’ll try to make that one,” he 
announced. “We’re down to only 
forty percent probability of success, 
but that’s about the best we can do.” 
Over the radio he explained the plan 
to the two team members on the 
surface. 

“Right,” answered Slazeck, from 
the far side. “Looks like our best bet. 
What it amounts to is that we’ll be 
relying more on resonance than on 
the force of the bombs. Want us to 
take the shaft nearest us?” 

“Affirmative. The computer indi- 
cates that you should sink it on the 
edge of that clear patch. So you 
won’t have problems clearing ice. 
You can go straight down, which will 
make it easier for you to blast out. 
We’ll need the ship’s equipment for 
the hole on this side.” 

“Okay, we’d better get started. 
Not much more than five hours to 
go, now.” 

“Check.” 



McKay got the ship under way 
again, maneuvering it painstakingly 
toward the touchdown site. 

“The shaft will have to go in there, 
below that shoulder ridge. We want 
to get the charge right in under the 
ridge if we can.” 

“I’m going to bum some of it 
off,” said McKay. He dropped lower. 
Close up, the ice cover looked a 
nightmare to land on. He was bring- 
ing the ship down slowly, turning 
into the tail-first attitude necessary 
for eventual touchdown. 

“Primary boost, three-second 
warning-we won’t need the shields.” 

“Check,” said Arnold. He gripped 
the handholds. 

As the ship neared the jagged 
surface, McKay fired the fusion sus- 
tainer motor. A short burst was 
enough to cancel velocity and push 
the RLV away again. The blue flames 
sank through the ice, splashing on the 
hard metal below. A hemisphere of 
glowing haze grew up and dispersed 
into vacuum. 

“That should do it.” said McKay, 
when the gases cleared. “We’ve 
burned down those surface ice ridges. 
They were worrying me— looked too 
insubstantial to land on. And we’ve 
cleared off most of the ice film over, 
the metal shoulder. I’ll put her down 
this time.” 

He turned through 1 80 degrees in 
the pitch axis, fired the motor to 
cancel their outward coast, and 
turned back again for the tail-first 
approach. He was maneuvering 
quickly now. Slazeck and Devlin 




were hard at work on their site, the 
precious minutes ticking away, and 
Arnold and McKay had not even 
reached theirs yet. He extended the 
tail blocks and eased down on the 
chemical motors, firing out lines 
from the blocks to anchor the ship to 
the surrounding ice. The blocks 
touched and their stabilizer booms 
snapped out. McKay cut the idling 
rockets. 

“Nice landing, sir,” gasped Arnold. 

“Let’s go, lieuten'ant,” McKay re- 
plied shortly, unfastening his straps. 
He could not say quite why he was 
irritated; though he was still nomi- 
nally in the USAF, with NASA, 
relations with his former colleagues 
had been strained since the Sasarenn 
confrontation. He led the way 
through what was now the floor 
hatch. With Arnold, he paused in the 
main cabin. 

Ill 

K athy had unstrapped from 
what was now the upper couch. 
Looking cute as a button in her brief 
space-skirt and scarlet body-stocking, 
she eyed the vacuum pot in its 
horizontal niche. 

“Not much time for coffee at the 
moment,” McKay said as he passed 
her. “We’ll be panting for it when the 
job is over, though.” 

“Good luck, Mac.” She smiled at 
him. 

McKay dropped from the floor, 
normally the rear wall, through the 
airlock hatch. “We’U go out sepa- 



rately,” he told Arnold. “When the 
ship’s upright, there isn’t room for 
both to suit up in the lock.” Closing 
the hatch overhead, he got into his 
own suit as fast as possible, depres- 
surized, and opened the outer door. 

Another difficulty. He had never 
had to leave the ship in this attitude, 
though Slazeck had done it on one of 
the Jupiter missions. Ordinarily he 
would be standing on the outer door, 
which would become a ramp lower- 
ing him to the ground. In this case 
the door swung up overhead, and the 
ground was far below. Normally the 
couch-sled units swung from vertical 
to horizontal and deployed from the 
rescue hatches to the ground; here 
the units came out vertical, and had 
to be lowered to the lock. Arnold 
took care of that from the inside 
while McKay extended the normal 
rear bulkhead as a platform and 
pulled the sled oyer on to it. 

He cast off the lines, climbed on 
the sled and lifted off from the 
platform. Foreseeing these difficul- 
ties, Slazeck had separated both nu- 
clear warheads from their missiles. 
All McKay had to do was transfer the 
second one’s lines to the sled, but 
even that needed the limbs of an 
octopus. He had to lock the sled’s 
controls, keeping it hovering un- 
steadily on short blasts of the air jets, 
while he held the edge of the missile 
bay with one hand and unhooked the 
lines with the other. 

Anyone with no zero-g experience 
would involuntarily have pushed the 
sled away with his feet. McKay 



HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



47 




avoided that trap but hooking the 
lines to the sled took both hands, 
and he nearly overturned. Once it 
was hooked, to ease the warhead out 
of the bay on the end of the lines 
was child’s play. Which was lucky, 
since his heart-rate and oxygen con- 
sumption were far too high so far. 
With the nuclear device penduluming 
below him, McKay began the descent 
to the base of the metal ridge. By 
now Arnold was in his suit and 
coming out of the lock. 

McKay lowered the warhead deli- 
cately, brought the sled down beside 
it. Then he spoke into his throat 
mike. “We’re going to need lights, 
lieutenant. Can you bring them down 
this trip, or should I come back up?” 

“I don’t think I could pay out 
both sets of cables at one time,” 
said Arnold. “I’d sooner you come 
up and give me some guidance.” 

“Will do.” McKay was becoming 
engrossed in the job now, though the 
need for haste was never forgotten. 
He left the warhead and lifted the 
sled back across to the ship, up 
toward the open lock. They had been 
able to do something like this on lo, 
though in its Earth-normal gravity it 
had been better to ground the sleds 
and winch them aboard when the 
RLV was upright. 

Arnold was loading his sled with 
explosives and the heavy-duty laser 
intended for cutting into wrecked 
hulls. Jockeying in as Arnold floated 
out, McKay paid the power line out 
to the laser by hand until it was well 
clear of the hull. Then he broke out 



their big rescue lights from the equip- 
ment bay, loaded them on his own 
sled. 

At the base of the ridge, the 
commander and the trainee got the 
lights set up. The metal surface, still 
slippery with ice patches, was treach- 
erous in the low gravity. As Slazeck 
had indicated, the asteriod’s pull was 
just enough to spoil coordination. To 
save time in the long run every 
movement had to be absurdly slow- 
helpless floating could mean only 
worse delay. The intense concentra- 
tion required was beneficial, though. 
To a degree the work diverted the 
minds of the two from the awesome 
disaster that threatened. Otherwise 
Arnold and possibly McKay himself 
might have succumbed to panic. 
They took the laser from its sling, 
mounting it in the nose of the sled 
that had brought it down. Before 
letting fly, McKay called Slazeck. 

“We’re way ahead of you,” Sla- 
zeck reported. “Four feet down, and 
starting to set our third charge. Rush 
it, Mac. Only four hours to go,” 

“We’ll catch up with you, using 
the laser,” McKay promised. There 
would be no recoil from it. 

Devlin was working with a hand 
drill powered from the sled, bracing 
himself with his EVA jetpack. At 
their end McKay and Arnold lined up 
their own sled on the intended shaft. 
They triggered, held steady. In the 
near-vacuum of space the laser beam 
was invisible, but a glowing hole 
appeared in the ridge. McKay cut off 
the beam. The hole swiftly cooled. 



48 



IF 




The projecting core of the shaped 
charge fitted neatly into the orifice 
made by the laser at that focus. 
McKay ' twisted off the detonator 
cap, and he and Arnold withdrew 
with the sled. He pulled up the 
plunger from the cap, rotated it 
ninety degrees, thrust it down again. 
There was no sound, but icicles 
which had formed on the fringe of 
the laser-blast shattered again. No 
cloud hung after the detonation. 
Gases had dispersed into vacuum, 
dust and fragments had flown out at 
above escape velocity. There was 
now a satisfying pit in the black 
metallic ridge, beginning the slanting 
shaft they had to drive for fifteen 
feet. 

This time the sled had to be 
positioned more carefully, to beam 
along the axis now established. After 
lasering, and using the suit maneu- 
vering pack, McKay turned himself 
head-first into the pit to plant the 
second charge and arm it. They had 
to clip a communications repeater at 
the lip of the hole, and again draw 
the sled back with them before firing 
the charge. Another soundless blast. 
Then back again, to plant another 
charge. 

Align the sled. ..avert eyes.. .fire 
laser.. .plant charge, arm it...with- 
draw...detonate. Thus was the shaft 
battered into the metallic bulk of the 
asteroid. If it had not been necessary 
for a fully suited man to go down the 
s&aft each time, the charges could 
have been set to blast a narrower, 
deeper hole. But the Sasarenn de- 



signers had not envisaged this par- 
ticular situation. McKay marveled 
that their systems could be adapted 
to it at all. 

Another precious hour passed. 
Three hours to impact, and the shaft 
was only halfway to the required 
depth. Fatigue was slowing the pair 
as well as causing mistakes in coor- 
dination. McKay fumbled with one 
of the charges, sending it tumbling 
away from him. If it had not 
bounced toward Arnold, who fielded 
it successfully, it would have gone 
irretrievably out over the ice ridges 
before falling. At that point McKay 
ordered five minutes’ rest. 

“Wish we had some of that coffee 
down here, Cathy,” he said wearily 
to the ship. 

“I’m keeping it hot,” Cathy re- 
plied. “Mac, if you have time, the 
boss wants to talk to you from 
Earth.” 

“Sure, put him on. Hello, Lang. 
Can you hear me?” 

The time-lag was much less now. 
Lang’s familiar voice arrived soon 
enough. “How’s it going, pal?” 

“Our shaft is about half sunk,” 
said McKay. “Walt and Dev are down 
more than that. But we’ll catch up to 
them. While theirs is an easier, 
shallower shaft to make, they have 
more trouble drilling.” 

“Not too bad, though. Doesn’t 
sound hopeless—” 

“Hell, no. We’ll get the warheads 
placed,” McKay promised. “Of 
course, what will happen after that is 
anybody’s guess.” 



HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



49 




“You guys will make it for us, 
Mac. Billions down here are cheering 
you on.” 

'^‘Any panic?” 

“None reported anywhere, 
strangely. Mac, you never saw any- 
thing like it. The whole world is 
swiftly organizing for crisis. Whole 
populations are treking to higher 
ground to escape tidal waves. Say it’s 
cut down to a rain of fragments on 
South America-there will be im- 
mediate worldwide response. Sup- 
plies, equipment, teams on standby 
all over the globe will be converging 
on the affected areas. Some teams 
from the U.S. and South American 
countries have already flown into 
Caracas, to be there when the crunch 
comes. They’ve volunteered to be 
right on the scene, assuming you 
shatter the asteroid and there will 
still be a scene.” 

McKay took a deep breath. 
“Thanks, Lang,” he said slowly. 
“You make me feel better. What 
you’ve been telling me is that if 
mankind has to go down, it will go 
down fighting. And maybe it won’t 
have to go down. Tell the world we’ll 
do our level best, for everybody.” 

He turned again to the draining, 
repetitive task of drilling. For a 
moment, he was thinking, the stars 
overhead had seemed close enough to 
touch. 

D uring the latter stages Earth 
majestically rose over the me- 
tallic horizon, more because of the 
planet’s increase in apparent di- 



ameter than the asteroid’s slight rota- 
tion. Soft blue light crept between 
the sharp yellow ovals cast by the 
work lamps, throwing the tumbled 
ice around them into relief. Earth 
looked incredibly beautiful, render- 
ing still more tragic the ruin ap- 
proaching. They were crossing the 
moon’s orbit now, an hour and a half 
from impact. But the final charge 
was in place. At a safe distance from 
the shaft, McKay pulled up still 
another trigger, twisted it and thrust 
it down. By now the shock waves were 
taking appreciably longer to reach 
them. 

Once again they maneuvered the 
laser sled back to the shaft. McKay 
had been making marks on the side 
every three feet as they had blasted 
down. The gap below the fourth 
mark looked adequate. 

“I think that does it, lieute- 
nant.” 

“Looks like it, sir. But can we get 
that warhead down here? And how 
can we load it in?” 

“We’ll hook it to my sled again. 
Then we’ll set up the timing mechan- 
ism, and lower the warhead and the 
sled on the same lines, using the laser 
sled as a belay. It’s going to take a 
while, so let’s get to it.” 

Precious minutes passed while the 
rig was readied. The warhead went 
down first, the lines from McKay’s 
sled passing to Arnold’s and down 
the shaft to the charge. When they 
went slack McKay guided his sled 
into the shaft, following it down to 
connect up the power cable. Arnold 



50 



IF 




was taking the strain with his sled, 
holding McKay’s near the foot of the 
shaft. 

“Okay, send down the foam.” The 
canister came down on a hand-line. 
McKay pushed himself back a few 
feet and sprayed the foot of the shaft 
with the acceleration foam used in 
the RLV cabin when a rescue gave 
them more passengers than g- 
couches. He worked back, spraying, 
until the warhead and the sled were 
fixed in place. Then Arnold dropped 
the lines, and McKay backed to the 
surface for the last time. 

“We’re sealing our shaft, Walt,” he 
radioed. “Where do you stand?” 

“Not too far behind,” came the 
reply, from Devlin this time. “We’re 
rigging the sleds to lower our war- 
head now.” 

“Check,” said McKay. 

He and Arnold sprayed their re- 
maining canisters of foam into the 
shaft, anchoring the last cable to the 
wall, and finally McKay connected 
the antenna that would activate the 
timer. 

“Seventy minutes to go,” he said. 
“I’m glad that in this low gravity one 
sled can lift us both. The laser, too.” 
They unshipped the laser and placed 
it back in the sling. McKay gripped 
the sled, and Arnold lifted all toward 
the airlock, up the smooth underside 
of the RLV standing on its tail in the 
blue Earthlight. 

With profound relief, they shed 
their suits and climbed through the 
main cabin straight up to the cock- 
pit. 

HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



There they found Cathy, her eyes 
anxiously following the perception 
displays. No one mentioned coffee. 
Her husband was still far from the 
ship, along with Slazeck. 

Then Slazeck’s voice suddenly 
burst from the com speakers. He 
announced triumphantly that the 
other warhead was in position and 
wired up. At fifty-two minutes to 
impact, he and Devlin were finished 
at their site and about to start back 
on their shared sled. 

McKay switched in the master 
communicator and passed the news. 

“Wonderful, Mac!” Lang re- 
sponded. “For the last hour there’s 
been direct coverage from here to 
just about every radio and TV station 
in the world. I guess the biggest 
collective sigh in history just went 
up. You’ve done a great job, all of 
you up there. Mankind thanks you.” 
“I hope the result will be worth 
the effort,” McKay said. He was 
relaxing in the form-fitting couch, 
content just to lie there until it was 
time to take off. When the antennae 
activated the timers, they would have 
two .minutes to get away from the 
asteroid. That would have to be on 
full secondary boost, since there 
were no Interface relays within 
range. So he would raise ship and 
align it for the getaway before he 
told the computer to activate. The 
maneuver would begin the instant 
the others were back. 

“Slazeck to RLV, come in please. 
We have a problem.” 

Arnold stiffened on his couch.

Cathy, fortunately, had returned to 
the main cabin. McKay jumped up 
and grabbed the panel mike. 

“What’s wrong, Walt?” 

“We have a complete power failure 
on the sled. I repeat, complete power 
failure.” 

“Report your location, Walt.” 
“We’re about a mile from the ship 
but floating down. Hitting the ice 
shouldn’t hurt us. We’re only about 
seventy feet up, and there’s practi- 
cally no gravity.” 

“We’ll break out more sleds—” 

“I suggest not, Mac. We’ve already 
used up three couches out of six, and 
nearly all our acceleration foam. We 
still have a secondary boost to get 
through. Besides, I don’t think you 
should leave the ship again, so near 
to impact time.” 

A minute or so passed while 
McKay thought hard. 

“Here comes our own impact,” 
called Devlin. 

Muffled sounds came over the 
radio. McKay stayed quiet. 

“We made it,” Slazeck said finally. 
“We were spilled off the sled, but 
there’s no damage.” 

“You’re right in the middle of the 
ice cover.” said McKay, eyeing the 
displays. “Shall I try for a landing 
beside you, or can you make it back 
to the clear patch in the sun?” 

‘ “I don’t think you should land 
back there, Mac. We didn’t seal our 
shaft as tight as yours-we weren’t 
anticipating rocket blast from the 
ship. Also, our shaft is vertical and 
shallow, so blast waves would go 



right in. On the other hand, the ice 
cover where we’ve come down is 
pretty fragile. All pinnacles and 
slopes. They would cave in under the 
ship for sure.” 

McKay began to see what was 
coming. “What’s your proposal, 
Walt?” 

“We’ll try to make it to where you 
are, Mac. If we don’t, you have to 
save yourselves and Cathy.” 

“Agreed, Walt,” said McKay, try- 
ing to forget Cathy’s husband was 
out there. “We’ll give you all the 
time we can. But we’re going to lose 
your signal shortly. The asteroid’s 
rotation, such as it is, will take the 
com relay over our horizon. I was 
hoping to take off before we lost 
contact with your warhead antenna.” 

“We won’t be wasting any time, 
Mac. Dev’s breaking out ice-climb 
gear now.” 

McKay looked at the panel clock. 
Forty-five minutes to Earth impact. 

IV 

I T was Devlin who had the experi- 
ence in ice-climbing. Maybe not 
on distant planets or wandering 
asteroids but at least on Earth— the 
Alps, ranges in Canada and Alaska. 

“I guess you give the orders for 
this part,” said Slazeck. 

Devlin was unloading ropes and ice 
axes from the tilted sled, “lucky we 
brought this stuff. We’ll have to fit 
each other with the crampons. Now 
look, Walt', it’s going to be mainly 
common sense, but we’ll have to 



52 



IF 




watch the gravity all the time on 
these ice slopes. It might seem we 
could bounce straight to the top 
using the suit jets, and maybe we 
could if we got a good purchase each 
time we touched, but how could we 
halt at the top? We don’t know 
what’s on the other side. If we 
couldn’t stop, we might tumble right 
into some Jagged blocks and rip the 
suits open. Or be carried onto a 
surface that couldn’t bear our 
weight. So we’ll have to go slowly 
and steadily. We can’t leap around 
here any more than on, say the 
Everest icefall.” 

He strapped the crampons on Sla- 
zeck’s feet, explaining the ties. 

“And keep your feet apart while 
climbing, or you’ll get sucked out 
through rips in your suit. Crampons 
are sharp as spurs.” He should have 
accompanied that line with a reas- 
suring grin through his polarized 
visor. But he had no stomach, at the 
moment, for grinning. He sat, legs 
splayed, watching Slazeck fumble 
with the unfamiliar straps. Then the 
two men uncoiled the climbing rope. 
In this gravity, it was like spaghetti 
with a mind of its own. 

With Slazeck on the other end of 
the 300-foot rope, Devlin took the 
carabiners and pitons and attached 
them to his belt. “Ice-axe in the left 
hand, ice-dagger in the right,” he said 
into his radio. “Use the pick,” he 
indicated, “not the adze. I’ll tie on to 
the carabiner on the dagger handle 
when the rope runs out, and reel you 
in.” 

HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



“You mean you’re going to do all 
the actual climbing— and just pull me 
along behind you?” 

“That’s it, Walt. Grade ten hard- 
rock tiger in the sky, that’s me.” 

Slazeck dug in the pick and 
dagger, paying out the rope as Dev- 
lin, climbing or crawling with con- 
trolled haste, made his way up the 
gleaming slope. Each yard was won 
by striking out first with the ice axe, 
gaining purchase and ramming the 
dagger home before the axe curved 
forward again. 

“You’re going out of sight from 
here, Dev.” 

“Okay, I’m tying on now. Hold 
the axe by the pick and adze and 
push the handle away from you till 
you’re leaning forward. Then I’ll take 
in slack.” 

With a curious bunny-hopping 
motion, Slazeck followed him to the 
ridge. 

“As an introduction to climbing 
this can’t be beat,” Devlin told him. 
“Little chance of falling, no rocks on 
the head, no avalanches, no sudden 
blinding mists...” 

On the ice ridge, the sky seemed 
broader overhead. They saw that 
Earth had swollen noticeably since 
the start of the climb. “But does 
your ass get frizzled by the atmos- 
phere on Everest?” Slazeck grunted. 
“Climb, Dev!” 

The sequence was repeated again 
and again, between the jagged pin- 
nacles, up and down the freakish 
low-g slopes. They were outpacing 
the asteroid’s rotation, lowering the 

53 




Earth back toward the skyline. But 
all the time the home planet grew. 
Devlin increased the pace as he got 
into the rhythm of the climb. He had 
gone on out of sight, Slazeck still 
paying out the rope, when it went 
suddenly tight. 

“It’s taut here, Walt. You holding 
back?” 

“It must be snagged,” Slazeck 
said. 

Devlin swore. “Okay, stay where 
you are. I’ll reel myself back until 1 
can free it.” 

The operation wasted another pre- 
cious minute while Slazeck stood idle 
at the end of the rope. At last Devlin 
told him to come on up to the cleft. 
It seemed obvious to Slazeck, when 
he saw the broken ice in it, that a 
line passed across it would catch. 

“Let’s watch it, Dev,” he said. 
“We’re getting careless.” 

“It’s the lack of exhilaration. This 
kind of mountaineering is a bore.” 
Devlin started again, across a mound 
of rough ice ahead. “It’s like a 
circular version of Mt. McKinley— a 
slow, monotonous, grinding climb.” 

By now they had to be near the 
ship, though the white nosecone 
steadfastly refused to break the hori- 
zon. They had been moving for more 
than twenty minutes and the Earth 
was huge. EVA in the Van Allen 
belts soon, just the ideal introduction 
to climbing Devlin had described. 

“Ridge ahead, Walt. I’m tying on. 
Come up.” 

Slazeck joined him on the ridge 
and stared over. An ice slope of 



seventy-five degrees, about sixty feet 
across, confronted them. 

“We can’t glissade in these suits, 
Walt. And a run’s too risky. We have 
to rappell, thrusting ourselves 
down.” 

The explanation of the technique 
took up valuable seconds. Slazeck 
was now in the lead position. He 
leaned back until perpendicular to 
the ice and thrust himself down: 
long, slow, parabolic leaps. In this 
gravity, it took forever. At last Dev- 
lin braked him as he neared the 
bottom of the chasm. 

He untied the rope and Devlin 
pulled it back to himself, doubled it, 
ran it over his shoulder and half 
around his waist. In due course, after 
another eternal descent, he too 
reached the bottom. 

He glanced at his watch, and at the 
looming Earth. “I’d say our time’s 
gone, Walt. If the ship’s not over this 
next rise I don’t believe we’ll make 
it. Daggers and ice axes. Do what 
you’ve seen me doing and keep the 
rope short.” He started briskly up 
the slope. 

The ship was not there. Nor over 
the next ridge, since they could not 
see the nose section. They were 
paying out rope to start forward 
again for a desperate scramble over 
the ice sheet ahead, when the white 
fire of the RLV’s chemical motors 
rose over the skyline and turned all 
the ice points to diamonds. 

AFTER radio contact was lost,, 
there was silence in the RLV

IF 




cabin. McKay felt acutely frustrated, 
resting unsuited in the cozy ship 
while his friends were struggling 
across that barren landscape. Since 
the vessel was standing on its tail, its 
occupants could see across the first 
ridge to the one beyond. They would 
glimpse the climbers coming, if the 
two made it. But the ball of the 
Earth was expanding so swiftly on 
the horizon that obviously the main 
issue now was speed, 

“They’ll get here in time, won’t 
they?” Cathy asked querulously, 
over the communicator. 

Wearily McKay rubbed his fore- 
head. “I don’t know. Climbing was 
never a hobby of mine nor, as far as I 
know, of Walt’s.” 

“And Dev’s been climbing a lot 
less since we got married,” Cathy 
murmured unhappily. 

Nearly a quarter-hour after loss- 
of-signal had cut off the climbers, 
Lang asked over the Earth relay 
about explosion time. “I’ll delay it as 
long as possible,” McKay replied 
loudly, for Cathy’s sake. ‘Ten 
minutes before impact will be my 
deadline.” 

There was silence at the other end. 
Eventually Lang came back. ‘There’s 
some feeling here that the conse- 
quences will be worse the longer you 
wait.” 

‘That’s debatable. The sooner we 
blast, the wider will the fragments 
spread. Destruction will follow over a 
broader area.” 

“The people in Venezuela may 
prefer it that way, Mac.” 



“The people round about are as 
important as Venezuelans,” McKay 
responded. 

That silenced Earth for quite a 
while. The asteroid and its human 
cargo rushed on toward the home 
planet at frightful speed, far faster 
than McKay had ever made the ap- 
proach by spaceship. 

The shortage of g-couches was no 
longer going to be a problem. McKay 
launched another of Earth’s Interface 
relays outward, to separate his ship 
from the asteroid an instant before 
explosion deadline. If Walt and Dev 
came into sight with only minutes to 
spare, he could now send the last 
couch/sled unit to them by remote 
control. Another power failure at 
that stage at least could not make the 
situation any worse. 

Suspense and frustration mounted 
as the minutes passed. McKay con- 
sidered launching the sled to bring 
them over the final part of the climb. 
No. Too risky. He could not pinpoint 
the location of the climbers, and to 
set the sled down anywhere else 
would mean they could never get to 
it. 

Once again, Lang called from 
Earth. “They’re still not in sight,” 
McKay told him. 

A short pause. “I’m deeply sorry 
to have to do this, Mac. You are 
ordered by the Committee for 
Earth’s Defense to take off im- 
mediately and trigger the bombs.” 

McKay glanced at the cabin dis- 
play. Alone down there, Cathy was 
plugged^ into the conversation. “Five

minutes more, Lang,” he answered. 

There was no reply. The Com- 
mittee knew it could not control 
him. Threaten to cashier him after 
his return? Nonsense. With the ship 
inescapably keyed to his own per- 
sonality by the Sasarenn relay in his 
head, no one else could be Planetary 
Agent on equal terms. 

Oh the ship, the nightmare was 
becoming reality. McKay knew 
exactly what would happen next; it 
was just a question of when Cathy’s 
grip on herself would fail. 

There it was. Her voice. She was 
asking, “Only two more minutes-are 
you really going to take off, Mac?” 
“I must, Cathy.” But he could not 
face that himself. “I can see no 
reason to prolong the agony. Even if 
they come over that ridge now, 
there’d be no way they could get to 
the lock in time. I’ll have her up in 
thirty seconds.” He threw switches, 
made preparations. The ship came to 
life. “Rocket acceleration warning, 
three seconds,” called McKay, clos- 
ing the firing circuits. 

“You can’t do it, Mac!” 

“I have no choice, ” said McKay, 
pulling back the throttle slide. Explo- 
sive bolts cut the cables and the RLV 
went straight up on the bright flare 
of the chemical motors. It was not a 
full-power lift-off, though in that low 
gravity it looked like one. McKay cut 
the thrust after five seconds, ac- 
quired the com relay and activated 
the timers. Ninety seconds to detona- 
tion— and on the radio... 

“Slazeck to McKay— good luck. 



Thank you for waiting so long.” 

The search devices suddenly pin- 
pointed them. They had made about 
three-quarters of the distance. De- 
cision seized McKay: he had done all 
he could for Earth, now he must save 
his crew. 

“Invert and cancel!” he snapped 
to the autopilot. 

The ship turned over much faster 
than he could have managed it on 
fly-by-wire. Eighty seconds to de- 
tonation, and it was heading back for 
the asteroid. 

“McKay to Slazeck. Report land- 
ing conditions in your area.” 

“Don’t try it, Mac. We’re on a 
fragile sheet between ridges. It 
couldn’t take the weight of the ship, 
much less a rocket blast-off. It would 
cave in, bury the ship and all of us.” 

“I’m coming in anyway, Walt.” 

“Okay, Mac— we’ll jump, you 
catch us.” 

Inspiration struck. “We don’t need 
that!” McKay shouted. 

He pitched the nose down and 
fired the motors, adding a horizontal 
component to downward velocity. 

“I’m trying hyperbolic flyby, 
which will be slow in this gravity. 
Stand by to catch airlock lines!” 

T here was no storm-front this 
time to blow the lines aside, as 
once had happened during a previous 
rescue mission. The ship sailed down 
with computer-aimed precision. The 
climbers grabbed the lines and rose 
off. 

Already the hyperbolic path was 




taking the ship away from the 
asteroid, but much too slowly. Arnold 
had set the orbital relay to bring the 
RLV to rest. 

“Up Interface!” McKay cried, and 
fired the motors to thrust the ship 
through. 

On Earth, the suspense reached a 
critical value. “What’s happening?” 
Lang yelled maniacally. 

“We’re clear of the asteroid, with 
the entire crew aboard,” McKay an- 
swered triumphantly. “Ten seconds 
to detonation.” He forced himself 
into some semblance of calm. Were 
they still on television? “Nine- 
eight— seven— six— five— four— three- 
two— one— fire!” 

The ship was now thousands of 
miles from the plunging asteroid. 
Still, McKay had expected some 
visual effect .on the screens. Or had 
the timers failed? 

“The charges have fired, I 
assume,” he told Earth, “though 
there’s no visible sign yet. The 
asteroid is going away from us very 
fast, but I’m going to higher magnifi- 
cations on the RLV sensors. Ah, 
there it starts— the ice cover is ex- 
ploding off, along with a lot of small 
debris. The fireballs are breaking out! 
If we’ve done nothing else we’ve 
blown two big chunks out of the 
asteroid, but if we got the resonance 
we wanted . Look at that! Two 
golden fireballs, coalescing into a 
rainbow sphere, too much ionization 
for our radar to penetrate—” He 
paused till he plainly identified what 
he was looking for. “We’ve done it! 



There are chunks bursting out on 
both sides, along the axis between 
the detonations. We’ve split the aster- 
oid right through the center! Not just 
in two halves, but into a great cluster 
of fragments.” 

“Fantastic!” Lang replied hoarsely 
from Earth. “Everyone’s going crazy 
here. I guess you can hear the noise. 
You’ve saved the world, McKay, do 
you realize that? Millions are already 
celebrating. Everyone is especially 
delighted that you managed to get 
Walt and Dev back aboard.” 

“Thanks,” said McKay. People 
celebrating. Delighted. Well, nothing 
with the weight or momentum re- 
quired to crack Earth’s crust would 
hit the planet now. It was safe. And 
destruction could not occur on the 
scale that would have characterized a 
hit by the single solid bulk of the 
asteroid. But the countless frag- 
ments, large and small, into which it 
had been split— they could do plenty 
of damage yet. 

He looked up. Arnold, the young- 
ster, had appeared at his side. 

“Congratulations, sir!” 

“There will be casualties by the 
thousand. Especially if the stuff 
smashes into land masses.” 

“But nothing like what would 
have happened if you hadn’t 
succeeded.” Arnold was elated. “Be 
sides, most of the smaller stuff will 
burn up in the atmosphere. And even 
the larger rocks will be peeled radi- 
cally.” 

“That’s true.” He unfastened his 
seat straps and leaned into the cabin. 



HOW TO BLOW UP AN ASTEROID 



57 




“What’s going on back there?” 

The inner door of the lock was 
open and Cathy was beside it al- 
ready. In the lock, Slazeck and Dev- 
lin were shedding their suits. “We’re 
doing all right,” Devlin called. “I 
hear we got the bastard.” 

“We split it into dust, metallic 
gravel and a bunch of chunks,” 
McKay confirmed. 

He retreated to the couch, stared 
at the screens. 

“The wreckage is still separating,” 
he reported to Earth. “It’s getting to 
be a long way ahead of us now, so I’ll 
move the ship down through Inter- 
face. You’re going to need overhead 
spotting when those big lumps get 
into the atmosphere, which will be in 
five minutes or so from now.” 
“Roger.” 

Acquiring the orbital relays again, 
McKay took the ship down to fifteen 
thousand miles, and again two 
minutes later to ten thousand. He 
had no intention of getting in front 
of that falling cluster of ^ot, or even 
meeting small fragments expelled at 
high speed by the explosions. As he 
went down to seven thousand miles, 
the other four were plugging in down 
in the cabin. “There’s going to be a 
fantastic meteor shower in less than 
two minutes,” said Devlin, “and I 
really want to see that!” 

“You might have been in the 
middle of it,” McKay remarked. He 
was watching some of the bigger 
fragments falling ahead of them. 
They had split the asteroid very 
successfully, but even a thousand 



tons falling at that speed would do 
more damage than a flock of H- 
bombs. 

His misgivings grew to near-cer- 
tainty as he estimated the number of 
fragments. 

“Lang,” he said, “I think this is 
going to be pretty bad, though not 
the global disaster it might have 
been. You’d better get out your 
worldwide alert now, in case the big 
flare-up interferes with reception 
later. The leading edge of the meteor 
swarm is going to enter the atmos- 
phere very shortly-in fact, I can see 
the first trails already...” 

He had to abandon the descrip- 
tion. There were no adequate words 
for the spectacle of billions of 
nickel-iron particles igniting in the 
upper atmosphere, burning them- 
selves to vapor. 

Beneath the fiery cover, glowing, 
the larger fragments were plowing 
into the blue haze of planetary at- 
mosphere. 

“There’s the first impact, off- 
shore,” said McKay to Earth. “A 
brilliant white flash... I can just see 
the mushroom growing. There’s an- 
other-and another. There are going 
to be to tidal waves all around the 
Caribbean, three more impacts, four, 
six— one of those was on land. 
There’s a second land hit-” He went 
on, completely the professional ob- 
server now, as dead silence took over 
in the RLV cabin. “Three more hits 
together inland. .another two out at 
sea. Oh, God ... a direct hit— God, 
on Caracas ...” •

H e was sitting in the shade, clear 
of the brawl, on the carved 
wooden porch of a roadside inn. A 
secret agent appeared out of the 
bright sun and offered to shake 
hands. John Wesley Sand looked at 
the plump man and his outstretched 
hand. A faint white scar circled the 
wrist. “Hello, Mort,” he said. 

“I’m calling myself Ralph now,” 
said the Political Espionage Office 
man “Am I blocking your view?” 

“I wasn’t watching,” said Sand. He 
was a lanky light-haired type in his 
late twenties. His left eye always 
seemed about to wink. 

The PEO agent said, “When I got 
the tip you were here on Silvestra, in 
the Cinco Territory, I guessed you’d 
rocketed out for the annual brawling 
festival.” The plump man’s voice 
changed to a deeper, buned one and 
he added, “But me, I knew you 
hadn’t, John.” 

“I’ll teU you, Mort,” said Sand, 
moving his glass of green ale slowly 
across the wooden surface of the 
table in front of him. “Right now 
Cinco Territory is somewhat hectic. 
When the brawling is over, though, it 
will be calm and quiet. Which is why 
I’m here. For calm and quiet.” 
“Please,” said the PEO agent in his 
higher voice, “don’t pretend you’re 
not for hire any more.” His voice 
switched lower. “We need you, John. 
We’ve lost two of our Political Es- 
pionage Office agents on this thing 
already.” 

“Now you want to lose a free- 
lancer.” 



The plump agent came around the 
table and sat down in the chair 
nearest the long bony Sand. “If I can 
get a word in here— me, Ralph—” 

Sand said, “I thought you guys 
voted on who was going to domi- 
nate.” 

“Oh, we did, but Mort won’t play 
fair.” 

“I get tired going around talking 
like a pansy,” said the agent, his 
voice deep again. “It’s bad enough 
being chubby.” His voice went up. 
“You’re the one who was twenty 
pounds overweight, Mort. I’m Sony I 
ever got stuck in that cruiser with 
you.” 

“You ought to be calm,” sug- 
gested Sand. “Here you are, a miracle 
of science, probably the only one on 
this planet at the moment. Enjpy 
yourself, Ralph.” 

“Ralph is some pansy name,” said 
the agent in his Mort voice. “Boy, it 
seemed like a good idea at the time. 
After those damned guerillas planted 
the bomb in the cruiser, and Fatso 
and I got blown up. Not enough left 
of either of us to save, but plenty of 
parts to make one composite. How- 
ever, being a comp is not much fun.” 

“Being alive at all ought to strike 
you as fun.” Sand scratched the hair 
over his left ear. “You .want to hire 
me for something?” 

“Let me explain,” said the Ralph 
voice of the comp agent. 

“I’d appreciate it.” Down in the 
bright dusty streets, intricate fist- 
fights were going on. The population 
of Cinco Territory was about evenly 



60 



IF 




divided between humans and cat 
men. The dozens of brawls within 
view involved about the same percen- 
tages of each. Sand sipped his ale, 
watching the yellow street dust drift 
up into the bright blue of midday. 
“First, what’s PEO paying?” 

Ralph said, “John, you’ve been on 
Barnum, our home planet, in recent 
months. So you know that there’s a 
little bit of an inflationary trend 
going on. To help curb this PEO has 
agreed to pay all mercenaries a little 
less for the time being.” 

Sand smiled quietly at the plump 
PEO man. “I figure if you can’t hire 
me, you’ll have to go after those 
highjacked weapons yourself. And 
you might end up like Brennan and 
DeBonnis.”

restricted planet, the transportation 
system isn’t what it is on Barnum 
and the obsolete weapons were 
shipped by train. Halfway between 
the old armory in Quatro and the 
spaceport here in Cinco the train was 
stopped and the weapons taken.” 



“John, do you know who high- 
jacked them?” 

“No,” answered Sand. “But you 
pay me ten thousand interplanet 
dollars and I’ll find out.” 

“Ten thousand?” said the agent in 
both voices at once. “John, didn’t I 
just explain about inflation?” 
“That’s why I need ten thousand.” 
“Ten thousand?” 

“Plus a thousand now for ex- 
penses.” 

“What’s going to cost a thousand 
dollars out in the wilderness?” 
“Bribes,” answered Sand. “Some- 
times it’s simpler to pay people not 
to kill you— rather than fighting it 
out.” 

“Well, John, since you’ve done 
such good work for us in the past,”

said thje PEQ agent slowly, “we’ll 
meet your terms.” 

“Okay.” 

“Do you know about a man 
named Dougal Amarel?” 

“Not too much,” said Sand. “He’s 
some kind of political maverick, 
hiding out from the provisional 
government.” 

“Yes.” The agent’s plump hands 
fluttered above the table for a mo- 
ment. “Amarel, a human type, has 
founded something he calls the War 
Rally Party. This particular planet 
hasn’t had a real war for seventeen 
years or more. Probably these brawl- 
ing festivals have acted as a safety 
valve. Amarel seems to think his 
people are soft and need a good 
rousing war to toughen them up. We 
suspect he may be the one who stole 
the weapons, intending to supply his 
followers with them.” 

“I haven’t heard anything about 
that,” said Sand. “Though it’s 
possible. Exactly what kind of wea- 
pons were on that train?” 

“Nearly three hundred dingbats.” 
“Dingbats?” 

“A weapon from before your time, 
John. Invented by a renowned scien- 
tist named Marcus Lorenzo Holts 
some three decades ago. It works 
wonderfully well in the jungle. Bar- 
num kept getting involved in jungle 
wars on one planet after another 
around that time and these dingbats 
came in handy.” 

“What do dingbats look like?” 
“They’re robots of sorts. About 
four feet high. They’re not humanoid 



but shaped rather like hot-water 
heaters, if you know what one of 
those is. They’re on wheels and are 
extremely good at tracking. They 
have all kinds of little extendable 
arms that can shoot and chop and 
hurl projectiles. You’ll see at the 
briefing.” 

“Why did Holts call them ding- 
bats?” 

“He was simply being whimsical,” 
said the agent. “Intellectuals often 
have an unfortunate weakness for 
whimsy. If you’ll come on over to 
the Silvestra Sylvan where I’m stay- 
ing, I’ll give you more background 
information and show you a movie.” 
Sand’s left eye nearly closed. 
“Okay,” he said, “but later on.” 
“Well, no later than sundown.” 
Sand nodded. He finished his ale 
and glanced at the nearest brawl. 

S AND wandered into the 
shadowed room and slouched 
down into a rustic chair. “Brief me,” 
he said. 

“You’re forty minutes late,” said 
the chubby agent, tapping a film 
cartridge with a plump finger. 

“Yes,” agreed Sand, 

“We think it will be valuable for 
you to look at this special intelli- 
gence film about the dingbats. That 
way you’ll be much better prepared 
to search for them.” The PEO man 
moved flat-footed across the dry 
matting of the inn room floor and 
shoved the cartridge into a slot in the 
television wall. “Some of this is still 
secret and classified footage, John.”

“Shall I close my eyes?” 

The agent chuckled in his Mort 
voice. “Enough spoofing. Let’s get 
down to the serious business at 
hand.” He pushed the starter toggle 
and the wall was filled with an 
enormous picture of hills and woods 
and" distant cottages in the early 
morning sun. “This is combat foot- 
age from the memorable battle of 
Leisure Hills Estates. You’ve heard of 
it?” 

“No.” 

“Well, it was a famous battle 
during the Eight Years’ War on Murd- 
stone some twenty years or so back. 
Here come the dingbats.” 

On the wall tank-shaped robots, 
nearly man-high, came rolling down a 
grassy hillside. There were hundreds 
of them, some bronze-colored and 
some the hue of gray enamel, moving 
ahead smoothly on thin black 
wheels. 

Sand stretched up out of his chair. 
‘That’s enough I’ll recognize them 
now.” 

“Wait a bit, John,” said the secret 
agent. “Watch them in action. It will 
help you realize how dangerous they 
can be in the wrong hands. There 
they go into the town proper. As I 
recall. Leisure Hill Estates was a 
suspected sanctuary for over-age 
guerillas. During the Eight Years’ War 
there were a lot of left-wing senior 
citizen guerillas operating. It was a 
war that produced some odd fac- 
tions.” 

On the wall cylindrical dingbats 
were rolling down the main street of 



the little town. On the cottage roofs 
old men in battle clothes showed 
now, sniping with blaster rifles. Arms 
began to sprout from the dingbats— 
arms ending in pistols, arms that 
spouted flame, arms that terminated 
in canisters of subduing gas. 

“They were very versatile for their 
time,” explained the PEO man. “This 
entire skirmish involved not one live 
combat soldier, not on our side. In 
fact even these combat movies were 
taken by a dingbat cameraman. 
There’s a particularly nice shot of an 
old lady and her rocking chair going 
up in smoke. Harsh, realistic— the 
face of war.” 

The burning suburb snapped off 
the wall screen and was replaced by a 
blond man in an old-fashioned 
synthetic leather jumpsuit, sitting in 
a tin chair. 

“This bit of film is from a popular 
Barnum program of twenty seasons 
back. I believe it was called the Ed 
Nerf Hour of Talk.” The Ralph voice 
took over and corrected, “Ed Neff.” 

One lone tank-shaped dingbat sat 
at a piano near the grinning host, 
playing a four-hand piano duet by 
himself. 

“Here you see part of a public 
relations effort to humanize the ding- 
bats,” said the PEO agent. “I have 
several hundred feet showing a 
white-bearded dingbat handing out 
gift packages in a slum.” 

“This is sufficient,” said Sand, 
standing once more. 

Ed Neff and the piano-playing 
dingbat were suddenly supplanted by

a vast flat field. In the center of the 
field stood a domed building. As the 
camera moved closer the name Simu- 
lated National Bank showed over the 
grilled building entrance. 

“These final films, from the Fort 
Anmar Proving Grounds, were taken 
some seventeen years ago. It was 
hoped the dingbats might fit into 
civilian life. Here they were supposed 
to put down a simulated riot at a 
typical branch bank. Look there, 
those six lead dingbats are getting 
much too excited. Here they’re 
shooting the eight or ten volunteer 
soldiers who pretended to be causing 
a run on the bank. The dingbats 
proved to haVe a devil of a time 
switching from live ammunition to 
blanks.” 

The wall turned white again. 

The PEG agent said, “Don’t you 
feel better prepared and better in- 
formed after this?” 

Sand made no reply. 

A PACK of bristling blue dogs came 
. stalking across the high grass of 
the plain. They snarled, yapped, 
bayed, circled. Sand scratched the 
side of his nose with the flat of the 
knife he had been using to slice his 
loaf of dark bread. He pointed thd 
tip of the bright knife at the seven 
Wd dogs, who had halted about 
thirty feet from him. “Easy now,” he 
told the pack. 

Sand remained on the stump he- 
was using as a chair. Far across the 
empty grassy fields were the tracks 
of the Silvestra Overland Railroad. 



By asking questions and paying out 
$320 in bribes in the past two days, 
Sand had learned that the dingbat 
train had been highjacked somewhere 
between where he was now and the 
small station town of Esforma six 
miles up the line. 

One of the wild dogs lurched 
closer, his shaggy blue head bent to 
the right and his teeth intermittently 
showing. He was making an annoyed, 
puzzled sound. 

“Alongside my knapsack over 
there,” Sand said, “I have a sturdy 
walking stick. Inside that same pack I 
have a blaster pistol. So if you 
fellows don’t want your heads 
cracked or your tails shot off, go 
away.” 

Tlie lead dog howled. Then he sat 
down suddenly and began scratching 
his ear. 

“Ticks,” said Sand. “Come over 
here and I’ll get it off you.” 

“I’m just in time.” From behind 
Sand a blaster sizzled and the 
scratching dog gave one surprised 
yelp as it turned to flames and then 
to char. 

Sand rose up quietly and looked 
back. Standing twenty feet behind 
him was a short and slightly bent cat 
man in woods-colored tunic and 
trousers. He was smiling, whiskers 
perked up, and putting away his 
silver pistol. “You a sportsman?” 
asked Sand. “Or do yau have some 
other reason for going around killing 
stray dogs?” Sand was slightly un- 
settled, since he had not heard the 
cat man approach at all. 



IF

“I’m the chap who just saved you 
from being devoured, sir,” said the 
cat man in his high voice. “My name 
is Olan and by profession I’m a guide 
and woodsman.” He gestured at the 
dogs, now running away. “Never 
trust a wild dog.” He moved closer 
silently, rubbing his paws together. 
“You no doubt have other methods 
on your home planet, sir— kind 
words, little favors, amiable persua- 
sions. This is wild country here, sir. 
I’ll tell you my rule. If a bunch of 
dogs are coming for you, kill one of 
them as soon as you safely can. This 
rule can be applied to more than wild 
dogs.” 

Sand sat down and resumed 
cutting the loaf of bread. “What are 
you working on at the moment, 
Olan?” 

The cat man rubbed his cheek 
whiskers with a paw and then rubbed 
his ear. “I wish you hadn’t men- 
tioned ticks. Whenever somebody 
mentions ticks I imagine I’ve picked 
up one.” He rubbed his ear again and 
squatted down three yards from 
Sand. His long brown-and-white tail 
swished at the grass tips as he spoke. 
“You’re this chap Sand, sir?” 

Sand nodded, left eye almost 
closed. “What did you come after me 
to sell?” 

The cat man chuckled and 
touched his whiskers. “You’re very 
trusting, sir. Perhaps I came rather to 
kill you and take your money. Here 
is another rule. With such poor 
people as you find in many parts of 
our planet you must not offer big 



bribes. Start with a small bribe. 
Better yet, give the chap an injury 
first and he may tejl what he knows 
for nothing.” 

“We have different views of our 
professions,” said Sand. “Okay, if 
you want to try and rob me get to it. 
If you don’t, make your pitch and go 
away.” 

“You’re the chap who’s looking 
for the dingbats, are you not?” 

1 am. 

“I can guide you to the men who 
waylaid the Silvestra Overland Rail- 
road train.” 

“Who are they?” 

Olan laughed a high fuzzy laugh. 
“Perhaps you’re not as amiable, 
really, as you act. Perhaps you’re the 
sort of chap who might learn what I 
know and then kill me.” 

Biting into the dark bread. Sand 
said, “So you’d like a fee to guide 
me? And you won’t tell me anything 
now?” 

The brown-and-white cat man 
spread his paws wide. “You’re a 
mercenary, sir, and I’m a mercenary. 
We understand each other. Pay me 
first, and I’ll lead you to the men and 
the weapons you want. But I’ll tell 
you nothing more in advance.” 

“Well, okay,” replied Sand, chew- 
ing. He pointed the knife at Olan. “If 
I ever decide to merge I’ll get hold of 
you. Right now I’ll continue on my 
own,” He stood and picked up his 
pack, keeping one hand near the flap 
concealing the pistol. 

Olan spread his paws again and 
rose. He smiled and his sleepy cat

eyes narrowed. “In a day or two, sir, 
ril look you up once more. You act 
like a chap who gets impatient. Two 
more days of no success for you and 
we can perhaps do business.” He 
bowed slightly and turned away. 

When the cat man had been gone 
ten minutes. Sand walked off toward 
the Esforma station. 

T he heavy woman stroked her 
inner thigh with one fat jeweled 
hand. She leaned until her chin hung 
over the small oaken table. Her tiny 
mouth pursed for an instant. “Cer- 
tainly, certainly,” she said to Sand. 
She slumped back in her chair and 
stopped stroking. 

Sand’s chair was pulled far back 
from the table and his legs were 
stretched out in front of him. “What 
is it you’re so positive about?” 
“Moms Granada is my name,” she 
said, rubbing in the vicinity of her 
large breasts until the nylon of her 
frock crackled. “Certainly you’re 
Sand.” 

He agreed he was. He had been to 
the Esforma station and the six- 
building town surrounding it. He had 
found out nothing, spent another 
hundred dollars. Now he was stopped 
at a small inn in the low hills above 
town. The round windows of the inn 
were growing black with night. “I’m 
better known out here than I ex- 
pected.” 

Moms Granada nodded her bright 
rei head at the frail cat man behind 
the oak bar across the room. “He’s a^ 
chum of Olan’s. Olan was in here 



earlier. He told the innkeeper all 
about you and what you’re looking 
for. That’s the very reason I invited 
you over.” 

Sand reached between his legs and 
pulled his chair closer to the large 
woman’s table. There was no one but 
them and the innkeeper in th6 
beamed whitewashed room. “You 
know, ma’am, I had you figured for 
someone in a line other than inform- 
mg. 

“Right. I’m a procuress by trade,” 
admitted Moms Granada. “That fact 
explains why I know what you want 
to know. My customers are a splen- 
did source of information.” She ran a 
heavy forefinger down the side of her 
pulpy face. 

“You know who took that stuff 
off the train?” 

“Jean-Paul Howzinger.” Her little 
mouth pursed again. 

“Yeah,” said Sand. “I’ve heard of 
him. He heads up an outfit called the 
Primo-Cinco Gang. Bunch of desper- 
adoes, highwaymen and cutthroats. 
Nobody has linked him with this 
job.” 

“People are afraid to talk about 
him much. You’re from off-planet 
and already you know he cuts 
throats. I can’t be hurt by him, 
though. Five hundred dollars-” 

“Buys me what?” 

“I can tell you where Jean-Paul 
Howzinger is hiding at this moment.” 

“Him I don’t care about. Where 
did he take the stuff?” 

“He’s still got it,” she said. “Two 
dayjs ago he did, at least. I delivered a

IF 




wagonload of girls there. I can draw 
you a map.” 

Sand lifted his left heel from the 
wood floor and then dropped it. His 
left eye closed. Tapping his heel once 
more he watched the fat woman. 
“Okay, ril buy your map.” 

“TeU you what, Sand-Til throw 
in a girl.” 

“Nope,” he said. “Tm here for 
dinner and a night’s rest.” 

“The food here isn’t all that 
good,” said the fat woman. “You’ve 
been around the planets and I bet 
you never saw a cat man who could 
cook. This girl is brand new. I’ve 
been scouting the area and I just 
hired her. I’ve got her locked upstairs 
now.” 

Sand closed his left eye again. 
“Locked?” 

“She’s had some second 
thoughts,” said Moms Granada. “In 
my line of work you can develop 
qualms. That’s why I’d like her to 
meet you first, rather than some 
back-country desperado or cut- 
throat.” 

Sand said, “Okay, since it’s a 
special case. You get to work making 
the map and I’ll go up right now.” 

“I appreciate this.” She touched 
his arm as he passed. “I’ll climb 
partway upstairs with you. It’s dark 
on the staircase and you can slip me 
the five hundred and get the key.” 

Sand grinned and started upward. 

T he girl was twenty-two years 
old, slim and blond, wearing a 
simple blue shift. She was tied to the 



near post of the four-poster bed. The 
ropes around her wrists were long 
enough to allow her to sit up straight 
on the old trunk at the foot of the 
bed. 

Sand locked the door behind him. 
The room was small, whitewashed. 
“I’m John Wesley Sand.” 

“Which are you—” asked the girl— 
“highwayman, desperado or cut- 
throat?” 

“None of those,” he told her. “I 
got curious about why you were 
locked in here.” 

“What did you pay Moms?” 

“Five hundred bucks.” 

The girl inhaled sharply. “Oh, 
she’s overcharging you.” 

“I get a map, too.” He came 
nearer, took out his knife and cut her 
free. 

“Now wait,” said the blond girl. 
“Did she promise to sell you infor- 
mation on the location of the Holts 
dingbats?” 

“Yes.” 

“I don’t know what she’s got in 
mind for you,” said the girl. “She 
offered to help me locate them while 
I was n\aking inquiries in Esforma 
yesterday.” 

“Instead she locked you up.” 
“Yes.” The girl had a fine sharp- 
boned face. She watched Sand for a 
moment. “You’re not with the Politi- 
cal Espionage Office?” 

“Only part-time. Tm a mer- 
cenary.” 

“Fine, because I don’t want to be 
obliged to PEO or any other agency 
of the Barnum government.” 



DINGBAT

“And who are you?” 

“Ann Veronica Holts,” she said. 
“My grandfather invented the ding- 
bats.” 

“You want them back for senti- 
mental reasons?” 

“No, I want to destroy them.” 
“Why?” 

“IVe been out here on Silvestra 
with a private foundation called the 
Remote Welfare Service for almost 
two years,” said the girl. “When I 
found out those dreadful machines 
were still in existence I decided they 
had to be destroyed. My grandfather 
was a misguided man. He even kept 
dingbats in his home. I was raised by 
him and I grew up around the 
things.” 

Sand put a hand on hers and 
shook his head. He was getting better 
at hearing a cat man’s approach. 
“You think this Jean-Paul Howzinger 
really has the dingbats?/’ he asked 
close to her ear. 

“Yes. He and his gang stole them 
to resell later. But Moms Granada 
isn’t really going to let you get the 
dingbats. She’s on his side.” 

“She is, though, planning to take 
you to his stronghold and add you to 
the girls she’s sold him?” 

“Yes.” 

“Okay.” Sand touched her hand 
again, then moved quietly across the 
moonlit room and unfastened the 
latch on the single window. He 
swung the shutters open and hopped 
to the ledge. Below, a gentle hill and 
high grass merged silently into pine 
forest. 



“I thought you were going to 
rescue me,” said Ann Veronica. 

“Eventually I am,” answered 
Sand. 

The door to the room was shoved 
open. The innkeeper, Olan and two 
other cat men rushed in, each armed 
with a knife. 

Sand jumped out into the night. 

H e bellied forward through the 
spiky grass, going in the same 
direction as the wind across the 
afternoon plateau and timing his 
flickering of the stiff grass to match 
that of the wind. At the edge of a 
cliff he rolled to his left, slowly and 
carefully, then raised himself slightly 
and looked down from behind a 
protecting shrub. Below Moms Gra- 
nada drove a sturdy, bright-painted 
closed wagon drawn by four brown 
grouts— a grout is something like a 
horse and something like a cow, with 
more legs than either— along a dusty 
trail. Olan, the cat man guide, was 
riding on the seat next to Moms. 
Inside, shackled, was Ann Veronica. 
Sand had been following the three of 
them since the hour after dawn when 
they had left the inn. 

Somebody stepped on his back. 
“Oof,” said Sand as a boot heel 
dug into his spine. 

“Stretch your hands out in front 
of you,” ordered a nasal voice. 
“Where’s your knife?” 

Sand twisted his head and saw the 
cat man standing with one foot on 
him— a heavy fellow in a rough home- 
spun jerkin. He held two long- 



IF 




stemmed pistols. “It’s poking into 
my lower ribs at the moment.” 

“Turn over and fetch it,” said the 
big cat man. 

At Sand’s nearby pack a human 
type had just located Sand’s pistol. 
The man was short and old, with a 
white circle of whiskers around his 
mouth. “Gun,” he said. “Loaf of 
bread, cracker crumbs, pinch of 
lint.” 

“Just find his weapons,” said the 
cat man. 

“I like to be thorough, you slim- 
witted tabby.” 

“The knife. Sand,” repeated the 
cat man. 

Sand, on his back now, drew out 
the knife. 

“Why are you out here?” 

“Hiking,” said Sand as the cat man 
dropped a booted foot on his chest. 

“You’re John Wesley Sand and 
you’ve been following Olan and that 
rolling bordello.” 

“Well, yes, that too.” 

“Hoping to locate Jean-Paul How- 
zinger perhaps?” A third person had 
come silently across the grass. He was 
tall and slightly bent and had a high 
forehead and slicked-down dark hair. 
He was graced with a left-sided smile 
and slightly yellow skin. 

“From the descriptions I’ve had,” 
said Sand, “you’re not Howzinger.” 

“How true. I’m Dougal Amarel, 
the noted revolutionary.” 

“Why don’t you get your foot off 
the lad, you glassy-eyed wood 
pussy?” said the bearded old man. 

“Let Sand up,” said Amarel. 



The cat man complied. 

Sand sat erect, wiping his chest 
with his palms. “You’re after the 
dingbats?” he asked Amarel. 

Amarel gave a faint chuckle, 
wringing his long yellowish hands. 
“Well, it’s an interesting story. I 
intended to highjack the train my- 
self. I had worked out a plan with 
DeVoto. This is DeVoto here,” he 
explained, pointing at the cat man. 

“They all got silly names,” re- 
marked the old man. “Foolish cat 
names.” 

“Well, so DeVoto and I conceived 
a plan for highjacking the weapons 
train. We got ourselves down by the 
railroad tracks, all beautifully con- 
cealed-DeVoto and I and fifty of 
my War Rally Party. There we were 
waiting for Ihe train,” said Amarel. 
“We must have waited the whole 
morning. And darned if Jean-Paul 
and his Primo-Cinco gang hadn’t al- 
ready held up the train sixteen miles 
before it got to us.” 

“When you got a pussy cat 
planning your strategy,” said the old 
man,“you can’t expect many coups.” 
“Smith here,” explained Amarel, 
“is a veteran of several wars on 
several planets.” He strode over and 
slapped old Smith across his whisk- 
ered mouth. “No more anti-feline 
talk. Smith.” 

Sand laughed. 

Amarel said, “I didn’t think you 
were someone who laughed at an- 
other’s discomfort.” 

“I was amused by the fact that I’m 
not the only one who doesn’t hear 



dingbat 




people sneaking up.’^ He nodded 
toward their right. 

Out of the grass rose six big men. 
The nearest was plump and mous- 
tached and wore a flowered tunic 
and neck scarf. He held a silver 
blaster rifle aimed at Amarel. “You 
ought not to come so close to my 
lair.” 

“Now this,” said Amarel to Sand, 
“is Jean-Paul Howzinger.” 

“So I figured,” replied Sand. 

S AND went stumbling sideways 
across the mud floor of the 
stone hut. The thick plank door was 
slammed and locked at his back. He 
retrieved his balance just short of the 
chair Ann Veronica Holts was sitting 
in. 

“Do you happen to have a screw- 
driver?” she asked. 

Sand flexed his right arm, the one 
Howzinger’s men had twisted behind 
him in the process of thrusting him 
into the hut. “Nope,” he told her. He 
crossed the dry gray floor and lis- 
tened at the thick door. Then he 
returned to the girl. “Would a knife 
do?” 

“Probably,” said the pretty girl. 
“Oh, by the way. I’m not angry with 
you or anything. I realized your 
strategy. I had a lot of time to think 
while I was trussed up in that stuffy 
wagon. Yes, I realized you were using 
me as a sort of stalking horse. To 
lead you to Jean-Paul Howzinger and 
his gang.” 

“Is that what a stalking horse 
does? I keep getting it mixed up with 



a scapegoat and a stray lamb. Why 
did you want a screwdriver?” 

“Over there,” answered the girl. 

In the far comer of the low stone 
hut were two cylindrical mechan- 
isms, obviously somewhat broken 
down. Screws and cogs and curls of 
fine wire were scattered about. 
“What are they? Two broken-down 
dingbats?” 

“Yes. Apparently Howzinger and 
his men had some trouble getting the 
hang of how the mechanisms work. 
They wrecked the first couple they 
tried to operate.” 

“I always,” said Sand as he 
reached down alongside his ankle, 
“carry a spare knife in my boot.” 

“Good. It’s fortunate you were 
thrown in here.” 

Sand handed her the short blade. 
“They seem to have sorted out the 
prisoners by affiliation. They put 
Amarel and his followers two huts 
over.” 

“He was captured along with 
you?” She left the chair. 

“Actually Amarel captured me. 
Then Howzinger and the Primo- 
Cinco bunch came along and cap- 
tured us all.” 

“While I was bouncing along, se- 
curely bound, in that dirty wagon- 
well, I came to the conclusion you 
were honest,” Ann Veronica told 
him. She dropped to one knee beside 
the discarded war machines. She 
touched the tip of the knife to her 
pretty chin. “Tliat’s one of the things 
that differentiates men from ma- 
chinery. Instincts. Hunches. Feelings.

IF 




I often argued about that with my 
grandfather during the hot stimmer 
afternoons I spent hanging around 
his workshop when I was a kid.” 

Sand eyed the chair she had been 
sitting in. He moved it closerto her 
and dropped down on it. “You think 
you can repair these two dingbats?” 
“Certainly. They had the adjusting 
knob turned up too high and that 
overheated these link rods right in 
here and naturally that put undue 
pressure on the mandrels as well as 
the billets. When that happens the 
extra strain affects the axial com- 
pressor and so all these thrust springs 
under here get loose and jiggle free.” 
“And you can fix it all up with 
just a knife?” 

“Well, a screwdriver would be 
better-but I think so.” 

“Are these things still loaded?” 
“Yes, because you can’t disarm 
them if there’s a malfunction. A 
feature my grandfather built in for 
battlefield protection.” 

“Then we can, theoretically, use 
the pair of dingbats here to help us 
fight our way out of Howzinger’s 
stronghold,” said Sand. After the 
Primo-Cinco gang had captured him 
and the War Rally Party people. Sand 
had been brought, tied and bent over 
the back of a pack grout, through the 
valley and up onto a rocky slope, 
thick with scrub and black cactus. 
Howzinger had nearly a hundred men 
with him on the tree-surrounded 
slope. They occupied something like 
three dozen huts. Behind the largest 
were two hundred or more packing 



crates with dingbat stenciled on each. 
While Ann Veronica tinkered, Sand 
wandered to the thick wood door 
and put his left eye to a slim crack. 
“That’s interesting,” he said. 

“What is?” 

“A hundred or so angry-looking 
guys are riding out of the woods, 
humans and cat men. Shooting a 
lot.” 

“They must certainly be Amarel’s 
War Party people trying to rescue 
him.” 

Sand sidestepped and put his eye 
to a different crack. “Howzinger and 
his gang are starting to uncrate the 
dingbats.” 

“To help repel the attack, I 
assume.” Ann Veronica stood up, 
absently wiping one oil-spotted hand 
across her buttocks. “There.” 

Whooping was commencing out- 
side. “Got them fixed already?” 

“Yes, I believe so.” She paused, 
listening. “Oh, they’ve got their ding- 
bats turned up too high again.” She 
reached down and fingered a series of 
buttons under a plate in one of the 
dingbat’s backs. Then locked the 
plate in place. 

T he war machine skittered a few 
feet. A thin alloy arm popped 
out of its right side and made a 
saluting gesture against the top of the 
tank. “Subaltern 068 reporting for 
duty,” said the machine out of a 
round grid in its midsection. 

“Go out through that door, 068,” 
ordered Ann Veronica. She got the 
other dingbat activated. 



DINGBAT

This one jumped erect, saluted and 
said, “God bless you, miss.” 

“Darn,” said the girl. “This one’s 
programed to be a chaplain. My 
grandfather always built a few of 
them to soothe his critics.” She came 
over to Sand. “We’ll have to make do 
with 068 here.” 

Subaltern 068, using three of his 
arms and a tube that extended out of 
his chest, had burned the hinges and 
locks off the big door and now used 
two metal-booted feet to kick the 
door down. 

“Moms Granada parked her wagon 
twenty yards from here,” said Ann 
Veronica. “Was it still there when 
they brought you in?” 

“You get an odd perspective, up- 
side down over a pack grout. But I 
think I did notice the wagon.” 

“Okay, 068. Cover us while we 
run for that wagon.” 

“You bet, miss.” Subaltern 068 
rolled out of the hut, two arms 
swinging blaster pistols. A flame can- 
non extended from his top. 

Keeping behind the dingbat. Sand 
and the lovely girl headed for the 
wagon. Although it was empty of 
occupants, the grouts had not yet 
been unharnessed. Sand boosted Ann 
Veronica to the seat and jumped up 
beside her to take the reins. “Get 
inside,” he told her. 

“I have to stay out here and 
instruct 068.” 

A thousand feet from them ^e 
Primo-Cinco gang by now had nearly 
half the dingbats uncrated. How- 
zinger was supervising while part of 



his gang fired at the advancing War 
Rally bunch from the protection of 
the hut walls. The dingbats were still 
mostly making whooping sounds. 
Some of them were running in 
wobbly circles among the men who 
were uncrating. A dozen of the war 
machines were firing straight up in 
the air with a variety of weapons, 
others were puffing out clouds of a 
green-hued gas. Fifteen were digging 
a trench behind the packing cases. 

“Get going,” said Sand to the 
grouts, switching the reins. The ani- 
mals started moving and the wagon 
rolled. 

Ann Veronica told her smoothly 
functioning dingbat, “068, make a 
path for us. Use your anesthetic pel- 
lets.” To Sand the girl added, “These 
pellets are the one humane touch 
grandfather agreed to build in.” 

“Right you are, miss,” replied the 
dingbat. Two new arms extended 
from low on the tank and the ma- 
chine went spinning down the slopes, 
firing at the invaders who were leav- 
ing the brush and cactus and coming 
up the hillside. 

An albino cat man was hit first 
and stumbled off his horse, falling 
asleep in midair a second before he 
crashed in a blueberry bush. Two 
white-bearded men fell next and then 
the War Rdily Party members started 
to pull back to avoid the oncoming 
wagon. In five minutes Sand and Ann 
Veronica had ridden clear of the 
fighting and were out in the valley 
beyond the slopes. 

Subaltern 068 whirred up along-

side and said, “Requesting per- 
mission to assume command of 
battle operations back there, miss. 
Now that you’re free of danger.” 
Sand’s left eye closed for an in- 
stant. “You’re designed to lead the 
rest of those dingbats?” he shouted 
down. 

“In the absence of authorized 
human military personnel, yes. 
Tliat’s what the 068 designation indi- 
cates,” replied the rolling dingbat. 
“You see, there’s no rank higher than 
subaltern among us. The numerical 
designations are how...” 

“Since there are no official human 
military people in charge, you are?” 
“Exactly, sir,” replied Subaltern 
068. “My fellow dingbats back there 
will simply keep running around aim- 
lessly unless some authorized person 
takes over, or some civilian such as 
you, miss, who has sufficient knowl- 
edge. This latter circumstance seems 
unlikely. What the dingbats need is a 
clear-cut order to attack a specific 
enemy.” 

“Okay,” said Sand, “go back and 
take over, 068.” 

“And who is the enemy to be?” 
“Round up all the humans and cat 
men on both sides and hold them 
prisoner until you’re relieved, 068,” 
Sand told the rolling dingbat. 

“Is that what you wish also, 
miss?” 

Ann Veronica nodded. “Yes, Sub- 
altern 068. And do it humanely, 
understand?” 

“Humanely?” 

“Well, as humanely as possible.” 



The wagon kept on, picking up speed 
as the road grew smoother. 

“Good luck, miss,” called 068. 

After a few moments Ann 
Veronica asked Sand, “You’re figur- 
ing to come back in with police and 
take in all those dingbats and outlaws 
and war buffs?” 

“No.” 

“Wasn’t that your job?” 

“My job,” answered Sand, “was to 
locate the lost dingbats. Which I’ve 
done. I figure everybody will keep 
fighting down there for most of the 
day and then the dingbats should win 
and lock the rest of them up. When 
we hit Esforma, I’ll telegraph my 
Political Espionage Office contact 
and tell him where the dingbats are.” , 

“You’re not the most ambitious 
secret agent I’ve ever met.” 

“I’m not an agent at all,” Sand 
said. “I’m basically a planet bum 
who works now and then to make 
expenses. Where do you want to 
go?” 

Ann Veronica shrugged with her 
hands. “I don’t know. Where are you 
going to stop after Esforma Sta- 
tion?” 

Sand’s eye narrowed. “Here and 
there,” he told her. “I’m on vacation 
again.” 

“That’s about what I feel up to,” 
she said. 

“Come along then.” 

She laughed. “We should have 
brought that dingbat chaplain with 
us. I mean, a girl has to be prepared 
for anything.” 

He laughed too. And kissed her. •

W HEN Rex Hereford took to 
working nights and weekends, 
the Head of Instrument Development 
and Research became alarmed. Not 
because working overtime was so 
unusual for this group, but because 
Rex was working on his own private 
project. And Rex was an odd bird. 

But the Head acted cautiously and 
with circumspection. He checked all 
requisitions of parts and even stayed 
after five himself, once or twice, 
wandering through the spotless cor- 
ridors and peeking into the immacu- 
late laboratories. Although he pre- 
tended to himself that company se- 
crets were being stolen, he knew Rex 
Hereford would never stoop to that 
sort of thing. 

“Crazy, maybe— but he’s a moral 
sort of guy,” the Head said to him- 
self. 

Rex’s behavior was a delicate 
matter. It had to be handled with 
discretion. So at 5:03 one evening 
Irving Gumbo, Rex’s extraordinary 
technician, found himself in the 
Head’s lavishly appointed office 
with a generous drink, poured from 
the Head’s own special stock, in 
front of him. Irving hesitated. 

“Nonsense,” said the Head. “It’s 
after hours. And well keep this 
meeting a secret between you and 
me. 

“Thank you, sir,” said Irving. 

He swallowed the liquor in one 
gulp. Lines of warmth radiated from 
his navel. The Head beamed at him 
genially. 

“Now, Irving,” he said, “I want a 



bit of information from you. No 
tattling, just an exchange between 
friends.” 

Irving nodded. 

“For some time now,” said the 
Head, “Rex Hereford has been stay- 
ing nights to work on a project of his 
own. I’m quite curious about it.” 

“So am I, sir,” said Irving. He 
leaned forward confidentially. “I 
stay here with him pretty late on 
occasion. He pays me out of his own 
pocket to wire up certain sections of 
some apparatus he’s been developing. 
But he’s never told me what it’s 
supposed to be for. , Of course, sir, 
I’ve worked strictly on my own 
time-” 

“Of course,” said the Head. “And 
where does he get his electrical com- 
ponents?” 

“If you check the requisitions 
you’ll find he’s paid for everything 
he’s used.” 

“I’d never do a thing like that,” 
said the Head. “I’ve never, doubted 
Rex for a moment. I’m just wonder- 
ing about patent rights and all that.” 
Irving sighed, “I couldn’t help 
you there, sir. I’m afraid I just don’t 
know enough about his project—” 
“That’s all right,” said the Head. 
“If you should find out. I’d appre- 
ciate hearing from you. And believe 
me, you’ve been quite helpful to me. 
Most helpful indeed.” 

He picked up his decanter of good 
stuff and to Irving’s dismay returned 
it safely to the cupboard. 

“Hereford is our most creative 
engineer,” the Head said. “For the 



77 




moment I see no point in alarming or 
antagonizing him. So don’t mention 
our little conference to him, will 
you?” 



I RVING GUMBO was baffled by 
the entire affair and, like the 
Head, was terribly curious. He had 
admired and envied Rex Hereford for 
many years. Rex was a splendid 
engineer. Also, he had the manner 
and poise of a dashing man-about- 
town. He had a hungry eye and a 
hungrier imagination for more than 
instrumentation design. The rhyth- 
mic twitch of a passing backside or 
the implied cleavage of a swelling 
bosom were enough to set him on 
fire. 

Rex was rather handsome— tall, 
debonair, with luxuriant red hair and 
a fierce red moustache that drooped 
over the corners of his mouth. He 
emulated the nineteenth century 
' dandies, wearing a succession of ele- 
gant checkered vests, a monocle he 
did not need, and pearl-gray spats in 
fair weather and foul. There was not 
a woman in the entire plant who did 
not find Rex irresistible. 

About himself Irving had no illu- 
sions. He knew that he possessed 
exceptional manual skills, that he 
had quick insights into circuitry, that 
he had few peers at troubleshooting a 
malfunctioning piece of equipment. 
But his appearance sharply differed 
from Rex Hereford’s. Irving’s squat 
form was topped by a face that 



might have been hewn from badly 
quarried granite. His black hair was 
stringy and unkempt. And he wore 
the same unpressed sharkskin suit for 
weeks on end. He envied the inde- 
finable allure of Rex Hereford and 
often wondered why Rex remained 
faithful to Becky, his flat-chested 
wife. 

Irving had gained some insight into 
the situation during one of those 
rare, intimate moments when the 
prototype of a new instrument 
suddenly starts to function at two 
A.M. after months of work, causing 
the men responsible to feel unusuaUy 
close to one another. 

“You’re as good with apparatus as 
you’re supposed to be with women,” 
Irving had exclaimed. “I guess you 
were born with the touch.” 

“I wasn’t always comfortable with 
women,” he said. “My father was a 
dedicated atheist. But to prove he 
was not immoral on that account, he 
set up a code of behavior that even a 
saint couldn’t stick to. There I was, 
despite myself, always trying to live 
up to it. Because I coveted every 
woman that passed, I assumed I was 
some kind of animal.” 

“But desire is a natural thing,” 
said Irving. 

“I realized that later,” said Rex. 
“Three years on the analytic couch 
convinced me there was nothing 
wrong in feeling desire. It was the 
deed that was sinful, not the dream. 
So I taught myself to make love 
mentally to all women. Yet the truth 
is that even now I couldn’t possibly

IF 




bed down with a woman I wasn’t 
married to. The moral code im- 
planted in my youth still controls 
me. I love Becky. She’s a good 
woman, sometimes even an exciting 
woman. But in my bones I know I 
was born to enjoy many women. I’ll 
never be happy until I can find a way 
to do just that.” 

“Have you thought of bigamy?” 
asked Irving. 

Rex Hereford stiffened. His fore- 
head and ears turned a red more 
flaming than his moustache. 

“Why do you ask that?” he 
muttered, staring into the techni- 
cian’s face. 

Irving shru^ed noncommittally. 
“No reason at all. I was just making 
conversation.” 

There was a silence of several 
seconds before Rex spoke again. 

“I have thought of bigamy,” he 
said slowly, eyes glazed as though he 
were in a trance. “But it violates my 
code, for one thing. For another, 
there are too many legal complica- 
tions.” 

This last remark struck Irving 
Gumbo as poor justification for in- 
activity. In his mind’s eye he too saw 
himself as a Don Juan— though 
trapped within a homely exterior— 
and if there were even the remotest 
chance of success he knew he would 
go to any lengths to satisfy his 
longings. But he said nothing, and 
the dialogue with Rex petered out. 

He continued to work evenings 
along with Rex, building large sec- 
tions of the engineer’s mystery de- 



vice, bothering no longer to ask 
questions. 

Then one day the project ter- 
minated as abruptly as it had begun. 
The sections of the instrument disap- 
peared. Rex Hereford stopped com- 
ing in nights and weekends. He 
seemed merrier, freer, like a bird 
released from its cage. 

Irving’s curiosity grew even more 
intense. 



H e recalled well enough his meet- 
ing with the Head, knew that 
implicit in that conversation had 
been the command to find out what 
Rex had been working on. Irving 
decided that for the next several 
days, during his off hours, he would 
shadow Rex as unobtrusively as 
possible. 

The technician adopted an im- 
penetrable disguise. From an exclu- 
sive men’s shop he purchased a mag- 
nificent double-knit suit with close- 
fitting tailored vest, suede shoes, and 
a deep blue foulard that knotted 
casually at the throat. A red-satin 
lined opera cape caught his fancy, as 
did a huge soft felt hat with a broad 
pliant brim he bent into a sweeping 
arc. He gazed at his image in the 
full-length store mirror and was en- 
chanted by the colorful reflections, 
confident no one could ever guess his 
identity. 

He followed Rex Hereford in taxi- 
cabs at a respectable distance and 
tipped the drivers lavishly. He tip- 
toed cautiously around building 



A MAN OF MANY PARTS 



79 




corners, face averted from the over- 
head lamps, the great brim of his hat 
shielding his granitic features from 
the curious passersby. One thing he 
soon discovered. Every night Rex 
went home directly to his wife and 
never emerged until the following 
morning. 

Irving’s eyes became red-rimmed 
and swollen from lack of sleep. 
Twice he was questioned by sus- 
picious patrolmen and forced to 
move on in spite of his entirely 
plausible story . .looking for an ap- 
propriate site in the neighborhood 
for a new Opera House. He was 
rapidly growing discouraged. One 
night, when he had given up the 
surveillance of Rex to attend a 
hockey game, he discovered the engi- 
neer at a rinkside seat with a magnifi- 
cently proportioned blonde at his 
side. 

It was clear they were enjoying 
themselves enormously. After a 
crushing victory for the home club 
Rex and his buxom friend went off 
to a nearby nightclub. Irving 
followed at a discreet distance and, 
although not dressed appropriately 
since he was back in the unpressed 
sharkskin, entered the club. A 
twenty dollar bill procured a table 
that enabled him to keep the illicit 
pair in his peripheral vision. 

They drank champagne, danced 
every dance with frenzied abandon, 
and eventually the blonde bit Rex’s 
earlobe, an act that brought Irving to 
his feet. With a breast full of jea- 
lousy, ^ger and sheer nosiness, he 



walked over to the table and fixed 
his sad eyes on Rex’s merry face. 
Rex leaped to his feet and pumped 
Irving’s hand joyously. 

‘irving, my dear friend,” he said. 
“It’s so good to run into you. I want 
you to meet Mary Lou, my wife.” 

“Wife?” croaked Irving. 

“Since Tuesday last,” smiled Rex. 

Mary Lou opened two enormous 
blue eyes and looked warmly into 
Irving’s tiny brown ones, touching 
off in Irving a feeling of longing for 
this ravishing creature. She held out a 
soft hand. He kissed it in Continental 
style. Rex nodded approvingly. After 
muttering his congratulations and 
drinking a single glass of champagne 
with the frolicking couple Irving 
made his apologies and fled into the 
night. Although tired beyond de- 
scription he went directly to the 
Hereford Cape Codder and took his 
station across the street to see what 
time Rex would return home. Rex 
never did return, or so it seemed. But 
in the morning the door opened and 
Rex appeared at the threshold, 
kissing Becky goodbye. 

Irving was enraged. 

“Fraud,” he cried to himself. 
“Pharisee, Tartuffe!” He had run out 
of epithets but he knew one thing for 
certain-Rex Hereford was not the 
moral man Irving had taken him to 
be. 

Thereafter Irving found it difficult 
to work with Rex, particularly since 
the latter showed neither signs of 
embarrassment nor any disposition 
to take the technician aside and 



80 



IF 




confess all. Rex was blithe, carefree 
and more hard-working than ever. 

O N the following Sunday, as Irv- 
ing strolled through the vast 
expanses of Sugarlane Park carrying a 
paper bag of stale breadcrumbs to 
feed the waterfowl, he heard the 
hearty booming laugh of Rex Here- 
ford. Irving crept up to a hedge and 
peered over it to see, to his utter 
amazement, Rex lying on the grass 
and tickling in an unmentionable 
spot a voluptuous brunette Irving 
had never laid eyes on before. 

He could not bear it. Casting good 
sense and discretion to the winds, he 
burst through the hedge and accosted 
the licentious pair. Rex beamed 
genially at the squat apparition and 
did not even bother to withdraw his 
hand from the gorgeous anatomy. 

“Irving, as I live and breathe,” he 
cried. “Let me introduce my dear 
wife, Letitia.” 

Wife? Irving’s mind would have 
boggled had it retained the capacity 
to do so. Once again he took hold of 
a lissome hand and kissed it, mur- 
muring pleasantries and best wishes. 
But as he backed off his conscience 
tormented him. 

Reluctantly he proceeded to the 
Hereford home and rapped gently 
with the gargoyle knocker. Becky 
came to the door and eyed him, 
bemused by the huge hat and the 
opera cape. 

“Is that you, Irving Gumbo?” she 
said at last. 

“In the flesh,” he replied, trying 



to summon up a jocular air but 
succeeding only in stumbling over a 
fold in the cape. “Thought I’d stop 
by to see you folks. But I suppose 
Rex is off somewhere?” 

He hoped he was being circum- 
spect. He did not want to hurt her, 
but ultimately she would have to be 
told. She smiled at him. 

“If you must know,” she said, 
“Rex is still in bed. He and I have 
been enjoying the morning to- 
gether.” 

It was more than Irving could 
handle. Either Rex had found some 
means of deluding his wife or Irving 
was hallucinating. He backed out, 
phrasing apologies about a forgotten 
appointment, and although Becky 
tried to get him to stay for a cup of 
coffee he ignored her protestations 
and stumbled into the tree-lined 
street. 

The following day he put the 
question directly to Rex. The engi- 
neer simply arched an eyebrow, re- 
moved his monocle and cleaned it 
expertly. 

“You did not see me in the park 
yesterday,” he said firmly. 

“But I did,” cried Irving indig- 
nantly. “And last week at the hockey 
game and also at a nightclub.” 

“Neither of those men were me,” 
said Rex. There was a whimsical glint 
in his eye. 

“I spoke to you,” said Irving. 
“And to your— your wife. You biga- 
mist, you!” 

It was out in the open. He had said 
it. He leaned back, expecting violent 



A MAN OF MANY PARTS 



81 




denials, recriminations, perhaps a 
physical blow. But none of these 
things followed. 

“I’ve got to tell somebody sooner 
or later,” said Rex. “It might as well 
be you. So far at least you’ve shown 
a reasonable amount of discretion. 
And the story will come out in the 
open some day anyway.” He bit 
distractedly at the ends of his red 
moustache. “All right, Irving,” he 
said. “Come along with me. We’re 
calling it a day.” 

T hey climbed into Rex’s natty 
red sports car and headed in the 
direction of his home. Rex drove 
silently, wrapped in thought. Irving 
said nothing, wondering what the 
denouement of this strange tale 
would be. They left the car together, 
both still silent. Rex led the way to 
the garage at the side of his home, 
opened the combination lock and 
drew Irving inside before turning on 
the overhead light. 

“It’s right here,” said Rex, “under 
this vinyl covering.” 

Irving looked closely at the device. 
It was a tall, broad cabinet with three 
vernier dials and a single power 
switch. He could relate nothing in its 
appearance to the sections he had 
wired. 

“I assembled it entirely on my 
own,” said Rex. “It was a back- 
breaking job. But the really difficult 
part of the operation was acquiring 
the enormous energy this unit de- 
mands. I withdrew every cent of my 
savings and took out a very large loan 



to purchase the enriched plutonium 
necessary for fuel. But the other 
fellows are helping me pay off the 
loan.” 

“Other fellows?” 

“Nine, to be exact,” said Rex. 
“Starting with myself, we’re num- 
bered zero to nine for identification 
purposes. You see, this device is a 
duplicating machine. It utilizes cer- 
tain ideas on sampling to produce a 
statistically reasonable duplicate of 
anything that’s placed inside the 
sample chamber—” 

He quickly grabbed a chair and 
placed it under the sagging figure of 
Irving Gumbo. Then Rex took a 
bottle of brandy froin the shelf and 
poured the technician a stiff drink. 

“Now,” said Rex after the color 
had returned to Irving’s cheeks, “you 
might ask me why I didn’t use this 
machine to duplicate something 
really valuable, gold for example. 
The answer is, of course, that the 
cost in energy would be worth more 
than the value of the output. But 
what about duplicating people? 
There is a feat not to be measured in 
dollars and cents. Not that the risks 
aren’t high, mind you, because each 
of the duplicates is not a true atom- 
for-atom copy. Only on the average 
would such an event take place. 
Therefore in principle it would take 
an infinitely large number of repro- 
ductions to produce a perfect copy 
of a human being. But it was worth 
the risk!” 

“Why did you want duplicates of 
yourself?” a^ed Irving. He still be- 



82 



IF 




lieved he was the victim of a mon- 
strous practical joke. 

“To set myself free,” said Rex. 
“Don’t you see? My blasted code of 
ethics kept me from the lusty kind of 
living I always craved. But as ten 
different men-and yet basically tlie 
same man-I could have my cake and 
eat it too. Right now nine of us are 
married to nine different women so 
that in effect, without violating a 
single tenet of my code, I have been 
able to live intimately with nine 
women. Incidentally, the number 
should be ten very shortly.” 

“And what about your own wife, 
Becky? Have you told her yet?” 

“Don’t worry about Becky,” said 
Rex. “She’ll understand. Remember, 
Rex Hereford Number Zero is stUl 
strictly her boy.” 

“And what if she wanders into 
Sugarlane Park the way I did and 
finds one of the other Rexes 
grabbing his wife Letitia in a las- 
civious way?” 

Rex’s face fell. 

“It shouldn’t-have happened. Each 
of the other fellows was supposed to 
take a job in a separate part of the 
country. Seven of them did. Periodi- 
cally we meet in our Family Circle 
council and exchange experiences 
with one another, the experiences we 
share as one man. Unfortunately one 
of the duplicates is slightly aberrated 
and a second is a flamboyant extro- 
vert. He’s the one you saw in the 
park with Letitia, who is not his wife 
at all. I must confess that he’s a 
particular source of worry to me. But 



he’ll learn to toe the line. Meanwhile 
I plan to tell Becky before she or 
some friend or relative runs into 
either of these two men.” 

He placed the vinyl wrapper back 
on the duplicating machine as though 
he were covering a sleeping Venus, 
then escorted Irving back to the 
street. 

“We’ll have to say good night for 
now,” said Rex. “1 haven’t yet 
nerved myself to tell Becky. You 
may be surprised to hear this, but 
since I’ve achieved this other outlet 
I’m more deeply in love with Becky 
than ever. And she’s going to be 
pleasantly surprised to see me home 
early.” 

“ITl never again be surprised at 
anything I see,” said Irving. 

H e watched enviously as Rex 
walked to the front door and 
quietly let himself in. Then Irving 
started slowly up the tree-shaded 
street, musing over what ten copies 
of himself might do if turned loose 
on the women of America. 

Violent shouting roused him from 
his reverie. He had heard family 
quarrels before, because the walls of 
his apartment were paper thin and 
the acoustics of transmission superb. 
He had always been both fascinated 
and repelled by the flaming emo- 
tions, particularly when a husband 
had caught his wife in an act of 
infidelity. 

But never, never in his entire 
lifetime, had he heard the same male 
voice shouting— and answering itself. 



A MAN OF MANY PARTS 



S3 





S CIENCE fiction has often been 
put down as mere category fic- 
tion, a minor division of the great 
field of literature. (Some prefer the 
academic term genre, which means 
the same, but applies more specifi- 
cally to the arts.) 

Well, science fiction may be good 
or bad, depending on the skill and 
honesty of the writer. But whether 
it’s a category is another matter. The 
dictionary first defines category as 
“an ultimate concept or form of 
thought,” and I can neither accept 
nor decline that application of mean- 
ing-but if the second definition of 
“a class or division” is meant to 
indicate limit or restriction, it most 
certainly dges not apply. 

Rather than being a limited class 
of fiction, science fiction is an enor- 



mous field where almost every 
possible division of literature can be 
contained. It can embrace adventure, 
romance, sport or mystery; it can 
involve spies and grand politics, his- 
torical encounters (of imaginary his- 
tory, of course— but as real as most 
history in fiction) and can even be 
used as a variation of western fiction. 
Asimov’s mystery novels and Piper’s 
historicals are at least as valid as the 
mainstream forms on lending library 
shelves. 

Science fiction can then go be- 
yond certain limits to embrace 
stories that cannot be done in the 
so-called mainstream or any other 
previously known category. For in- 
stance, all other forms of fiction are 
based upon man’s struggle to deal 
with himself or with his terrestrial 



84 




environment. Only science fiction 
can and does reach beyond such 
narrow and provincial bounds. 

In fact, if I were to try to find an 
inclusive definition of our field, 
rather than the exclusive one I’ve 
used before, I would have to define 
science fiction as: fiction that con- 
cerns itself with all time, all space 
and all possibilities. Its only and 
self-imposed restriction is that it 
rarely deals with the limited areas of 
general fiction, since those are al- 
ready sufficiently exhausted. 

There are a large number of divi- 
sions-or categories— within this enor- 
mous field and I have no idea of how 
many. Lxmg ago, trying to list them, 
I gave up after naming thirty-plus, 
but there must be many more that 
could be recognized as definite and 
familiar types by readers with an 
extensive familiarity with science fic- 
tion. If anyone else has drawn up 
such a listing. I’d like to see it— 
perhaps eventually we could derive 
acceptable names for purposes of 
cataloguing. 

Certainly some of the oldest and 
most generally accepted sf is made up 
of what I call the Sudden Doom 
story. This involves some sudden 
development or discovery that 
threatens total ruin to Earth as we 
know it. The major early example of 
this would be H.G. Wells’ War of the 
Worlds. More recently, Wyndham^ 
Ballard and Christopher have given us 



good examples, and The Andromeda 
Strain by Crichton was one of the 
more successful ones in terms of 
sales. 

Now we have Mutant 59: The 
Plastic Eaters, by Kit Pedler and 
Gerry Davis (Bantam, $1.50). This is 
a fairly good example of the type, 
depending chiefly on suspense. Like 
all the best doom stories, it is set in 
the very near future and involves 
only a single supposition. A scientist 
becomes interested in the difficulty 
of disposing of used plastic bags in 
his sewage and attempts to breed a 
strain of bacteria that can live off 
and destroy such plastic. (Not too 
hard to believe when we realize some 
of the things that known bacteria can 
digest.) He succeeds and the bacteria 
break free and begin attacking all 
plastic in London— and eventually, of 
course, will spread over the whole 
world. 

It’s a nice, simple idea, depicting a 
redistic threat. Almost all insulation 
is a form of plastic. When that is 
gone, nothing electrical or electronic 
can work properly. Automobiles and 
planes cannot operate— indeed, so 
much plastic is used in modern 
planes that they would probably fall 
to pieces in flight. Almost every form 
of modern life is threatened. 

Unlike the Crichton story, this 
novel is on fairly firm ground in its 
use of science. In theory, at least, 
most of it could happen. And the 



readimg room 



85 




authors play fair with the reader, 
again unlike Crichton. This time the 
menace does not xhange all by itself 
and prove to be only a paper dragon, 
looking fierce at first, but turning 
out to be really quite harmless to 
provide a phony ending. The ending 
is a bit weak, but more from the 
human presentation of it than from 
the lack of validity against the prob- 
lem posed. The human problems 
seem to have a solution that is almost 
an anticlimax after the major prob- 
lem posed by the doom situation. 

In fact, the weakness of the novel 
lies in the characters, not the situa- 
tion. In the beginning of the story, 
they are too many and too typecast 
for us to follow easily. This seems to 
clear up during the middle of the 
book when a small group is faced 
with the problem of survival while 
trapped underground, but once that 
difficulty is solved, no further devel- 
opment of character is shown. The 
human elements of the story remain 
mere pegs to hang the story on 
instead of people about whom we 
can be vitally concerned. 

One of the best sections of the 
novel takes place on board an air- 
plane where a scientist with evidence 
on the nature of the menace dis- 
covers that he has unwittingly 
brought the bacteria on board— and 
must watch the plastic of the plane 
become useless goo before his eyes. 

As a suspense story, it is good. In 



all other ways it is only fair, though a 
good deal better than most other 
popular examples of this type we’ve 
seen for some time. Recommended 
for quick reading. 

ANOTHER grouping consists of 
xmwhat I call the World After 
Chaos novel. (Sometimes this is re- 
ferred to as Our Barbarous Descen- 
dants, but since the category doesn’t 
demand barbarians, I prefer a more 
general heading.) This type of story, 
of course, deals with what happens 
to our world after some cataclysm 
has destroyed our civilization— we 
may have had atomic warfare, been 
struck by some great plague or what- 
ever, but most of what we know has 
been wiped out and Earth is starting 
over. Examples ran rife shortly after 
World War II, but perhaps the best 
was Davy, by Edgar Pangborn— up 
until now. 

Hiero's Journey, by Sterling La- 
nier (Chilton, $6.95), is an outstand- 
ing example of this type of novel. 

Lanier is a trained zoologist and 
obviously has the interests of a full 
naturalist-in the best sense in which 
that word was once used. He lays his 
story in the year 7476, long after 
the destruction of civilization by a 
great atomic war. The mutations 
from radiation have already taken 
place and the ecology is now fully 
stabilized around a mixture of fami- 
liar and mutated life forms. But the 




time that permitted this adjustment 
has not been so great that all records 
and memories of the past have been 
destroyed. 

Now the descendants of certain 
French-Canadians and Indians, who 
occupy what was midwestern Can- 
ada, are striving to build a secure 
culture against the subtle and secret 
attacks of what they call the Un- 
clean— apparently humans who have 
mutated somewhat and who hate all 
normal mankind. The nonmutants 
survived because they were scattered, 
rural groups well removed from the 
cities that were destroyed— but they 
began environmental reconstruction 
with little of our civilized knowledge 
and were sorely ignorant of much of 
what they had to know to survive. 

Hiero, a priest-scientist and 
warrior, is sent out alone dn a 
mission. He must cross a largly un- 
known and hostile wilderness to the 
ruins of the ancient cities in search of 
something vaguely known as a com- 
puter; such a device is the only hope 
of coordinating the shreds of knowl- 
edge still preserved to make resisting 
the Unclean possible. 

It is quite a trip. And the joy for 
the reader comes not merely from 
the high adventure, but from the 
richness and reality of the world 
Lanier has created. This isn’t a mere 
distortion of our own world in 
poorer terms, nor some imitation of 
one of our earlier times— it’s a world 



that hangs together with color and 
feeling of its own. Weapons, life- 
style, beasts, plants, climate and even 
such things as religion all fit into a 
viable Weltansicht and Zeitgeist of 
Lanier’s own. 

There are characters enough here 
to please any romantic, too. There’s 
a tamed morse (moose-horse), a mar- 
velous bear, a girl from the lands 
once civilized, a tree woman, pirates, 
good-guy Eleveners and Unclean bad 
guys. Happily, nothing is ever too 
simple, nor is everything always what 
it seems. 

There is a good adventure story 
behind it all, with a satisfactory 
ending that isn’t too easily foreseen, 
though Lanier has left himself oppor- 
tunities for later adventures to follow 
this. I hope he does go on to make it 
a series, if he can give us more as 
good as Hiero *s Journey. 

It is the best example of this 
type of story that I have seen. Highly 
recommended. 

O NE early category has currently 
been enjoying a great revival. 
This is what I call the Sword And 
Planet novel. It’s somewhat like 
Sword And Sorcery, but with less 
emphasis on sorcery (sometimes re- 
placed by arcane “science”), and 
with the exotic cultural background 
laid on another planet instead of in a 
mythical past of Earth. At its best, 
its hero is a reasonably intelligent

man, rather than the barbarian of the 
Conan-type story. Edgar Rice Bur- 
roughs brought this story form its 
early popularity and a flood of books 
recently have either imitated his 
work or derived from it. 

Messenger of Zhuvastou, by An- 
drew J. Offutt (Berkley, 75c) is of 
the type, but is less derivative than 
many others. Offutt begins with a 
rich and highly educated young man 
from Earth seeking entry to a quite 
primitive planet, where Earthmen are 
sworn not to upset the native culture 
by introducing their technology. His 
excuse is that he’s searching for his 
fiancee, who is now on Zhuvastou. 

With a lot of warning, he’s finally 
admitted. And then his troubles be- 
gin. The natives aren’t all noble 
savages— they tend more to be realis- 
tic semi-savages, dirty, crude and 
violent. And there is evidence that 
other Earthmen who have come 
there are probably engaged in some- 
thing even more violent than the 
natives have developed for them- 
selves. It also turns out that there’s a 
lot more to that story of his 
“fiancee” than he told the entry 
guards. 

There is plenty of swordplay and 
fitting, intrigue and confusion, as in 
the best Sword And Planet work. 
There’s also a bawdy good-humor 
not usually found. (The chapter 
headings seem to be a bit too well 
designed for comedy— forget them. 



though they fit the story-the story 
itself is honest high adventure.) 

Zhuvastou is a good planet for 
background, somewhere between a 
Burroughs type and one whose cul- 
ture is treated in more serious science 
fiction. I think this evolution is a 
happy one. The natives are convinc- 
ing, their conflicts are believable and 
the part in their plotting and politics 
played by Earth and a few people 
from Earth fits in excellently. 
Finally, Offutt may seem at times to 
stray casually from one adventure to 
another, but in the end he sews 
everything into a related whole. 

To all the readers who love this 
type of fiction: Offutt’s novel should 
not be missed. It brings a breath of 
freshness into a field that needs it, 
without ruining the attraction that is 
still inherent in it. 



ANOTHER of Offutt’s novels 
-tjL pleases me much less. This is 
Ardor on Argos (Dell, 95c). Inci- 
dentally, despite its higher price, it’s 
also a much shorter book than Zhu- 
vastou— thzt may be part of the 
trouble, since good Sword And 
Planet seems to require space in 
which to develop its full flavor. 

This book obviously cleaves much 
closer to the ancient formula, with 
an introduction on how Offutt got 
the story from the real hero, etc., 
rather than wrote it. Then it goes

finally is hurled into another world. 
When he lands our hero takes time to 
speculate on all the works of Bur-

Mars. (This is fiction eating itself, as I 
see it, and it isn’t usually good 
technique.) After that, we finally get 
down to the adventure, which seems 
pretty good for a while. But then we 
begin to run into anomalies— jungles 
that aren’t there, though they seem to 
be, for instance. It all begins to take 
on a dreamlike quality. 

In the end we find that it is 
dreamlike— the quality is explained 
adequately, but still weakens the 
action-romance we want from this 
type of story. (Also, it presents an 
old plotting flaw— when anything can 



happen, as in a dream, noting really 
matters and any problem can be 
solved by some other sudden devel-

The ending has some element of

been.

humans share a common evolution. 

Poul Anderson’s The People of the 
Wind (Signet, 95c) explores the cate- 
gorical theme the hard way— by at- 
tempting Jo realize the nonhumans 
and their culture in careful detail. In 
this case, the aliens are birdlike 
people called the Ythri. 

Anderson seems fascinated with 
intelligent avians, probably because a 
culture developed by winged crea- 
tures capable of flight, yet with some 
kind of technical civilization, pre- 
sents major difficulties of portrayal. 
He tried it in The War of the Winged 
Men, but his interest there was in his 
human, van Rijn. As a result, the 
avians were mostly sketched in. Re- 
cently he returned to the problem, 
giving it much more thought. He 
came up with a short story in which 
he showed how flight might be 
possible for creatures heavy enough 
to have complex brains and ability to 
handle tools-and his “super- 
chargers” for supplying oxygen for 
such work was a fine detail. This story 
told of the discovery of the aliens. 

Now the novel takes place after 
men and Ythrians have settled to- 
gether on the planet of Avalon. 
Several generations have passed, and 
the young people of both races are 
beginning to associate freely, with a 
great blurring of their natural cul- 
tures. These are moments of high 
emotional tension and sometimes of 
tragedy. The Ythrian “prostitute” 



must arouse more pity than could 
ever be given to any human in the 
same plight, for instance. And the 
displaced humans who feel the at- 
traction toward Ythrian flightmates 
possess real and moving feelings we 
can share. 

Unfortunately, it seems to me, 
Anderson has “pulped” a marvelous 
background that should have been 
handled for its own dramatic values; 
he has added a space war, in which 
the two races on Avalon are being 
attacked by the whole Terran Em- 
pire. This has produced melodrama 
and clever plotting where we should 
have had something deeper than the 
action of spaceships being destroyed 
or the politics of Earth-interesting, 
but not too unusual. 

There is enough material on 
Ythrian culture and on the problems 
of the two races cohabiting a planet 
to show that this intrusion of ex- 
traneous action was not caused by 
Anderson’s inability to handle his 
main story. What there is of biracial 
adjustment is superb, with obvious 
evidence that Anderson has thought 
out the problem in great detail. I 
wish he’d stuck to that story. 

This could have been a landmark 
work of science fiction-the first to 
explore the problem in the detail and 
with the understanding and empathy 
it deserves. As it is, despite the war, 
it’s a very good book— but unfor- 
tunately, no more. •

O F course we moved into the 
cities of Zobranoirundisi when 
Worlds Federated finally permitted a 
colony there. Although Survey had 
kept a watch on the planet for more 
than thirty years standard and the 
cities were obviously on a standby 
directive, the absentee owners re- 
mained conspicuous by their ab- 
sence. Since Resources and Supplies 
had agitated in Council for another 
breadbasket planet in that sector of 
the galaxy and Zobranoirundisi was 
unoccupied we were sent in, char- 
tered to be self-sufficient in one 
sidereal year and to produce a sur- 
plus in two. 

It would, therefore, have been a 
great misdirection of effort not to 
have inhabited the cities— we only 
moved into four— so patently suitable 
for humanoid life forms. The murals 
that decorated a conspicuous wall in 
every dwelling gave only a vague idea 
of the physiology of our landlords, 
always depicted in an attitude of 
reverent obeisance toward a domi- 
nating Tree symbol so that only the 
backs, the rounded fuzzy-covered 
craniums and the suggestion of arms 
extended in front of the bodies were 
visible. 

I suppose if we had not been so 
concerned with establishing the 
herds, getting in the crops and so 
forth, generally breaking our necks 
to meet the Colony Charter require- 
ments, we might have discovered 
sooner that there had been a gross 
error. The clues were there. For 
example, although we inhabited the 



cities they could not be brought to 
“operational” fully despite all the 
efforts of Dunlapil, the metropolitan 
engineer. Then too, we could find no 
single example of the Tree anywhere 
on the lush planet. But with R&S on 
our backs to produce, produce, pro- 
duce, we didn’t take time to delve 
into the perplexing anomalies. 

Dunlapil, with his usual urbane 
contempt for the botanical, quipped 
to Martin Chavez, our ecologist, that 
the Tree was the Tree of Life and 
therefore mythical. 

“Carry the analogy further,” he 
would tease Martin, “and it explains 
why the Zobranoirundisi left. Some 
dissident plucked the Apple and got 
’em all kicked out of the Garden of 
Eden.” 

Eden might well have been 
modeled on Zobranoirundisi with its 
velvet fields, parklike forests and 
rolling plains. Amid these sat lovely 
little cities constructed of pressed 
fibrous blocks tinted in pleasant 
colors during a manufacturing pro- 
cess whose nature frustrated Dunlapil 
as much as the absence of the Tree 
perplexed Chavez. 

So, suppressing our pervasive sense 
of trespassing, we moved into the 
abandoned dwellings, careful not to 
make any irreparable changes to ac- 
commodate our equipment. In fact 
the only sophisticated, non- 
indigenous equipment that I as 
Colony Commissioner permitted 
within any city was the plastistele 
Comtower. I ordered the rocketport 
constructed beyond a low range of

IF 




foothills on the rather scrubby plain 
at some distance from my head- 
quarters city. An old riverbed proved 
an acceptable road for moving cargo 
to and from the port and no one 
really objected to the distance. It 
would be far better not to offend our 
landlords with the dirt and chaos of 
outer-space commerce clo^e to their 
pretty city. 

We pastured the 'cattle in the 
neatly separated velvet fields. Martin 
Chavez worried when close inspec- 
tion disclosed that each velvet field 
was underpinned by its own ten- 
meter-thick foundation of ancient 
rock-hard clay. Those same founda- 
tions housed what seemed to be a 
deep irrigation system under every 
field. 

I did ask Martin Chavez to investi- 
gate the curious absence of herbi- 
vores from a planet so perfectly 
suited to them. He had catalogued 
several types of omnivores, a wide 
variety of fowl and a plethora of 
fishes. He did discover some fossil 
remains of herbivores but nothing 
more recent than traces comparable 
to those of our Pleistocene epoch. 

He was therefore forced to con- 
clude-and submitted his voluminous 
report with numerous comparisons 
to nearby galactic examples— that 
some catastrophe, perhaps the same 
that had wiped out the humanoids, 
had eliminated the herbivores at an 
earlier stage. 

Whatever the disaster had been— 
bacterial, viral or something more 
esoteric— it did not recur to plague 



us. We thrived on Zobranoirundisi. 
The first children, conceived under 
the bluish alien sun, were born just 
after we had shipped our first year’s 
surplus off-world. Life settled into a 
pleasant seasonal routine: the beef, 
sheep, horses, kine, even the win- 
doers of Grace’s World imported to 
Zobranoirundisi on an experimental 
basis, multiplied on the velvet fields. 
The xenograrian crops from half a 
dozen worlds gave us abundant 
yields. We had some failures, of 
course, with inedible or grotesque 
ergotian mutations, but not enough 
to be worth more than a minor 
Chavezian thesis in the record and a 
shrug of the pioneering farmer. If a 
colonist is eating well, living comfort- 
ably, with leisure time for his kids 
and time off with his wife on the 
languid Southern seas, he puts up 
with minor failures and irritations. 
Even with the omnipresent guilt of 
trespassing. 

I was not the only one who never 
felt entirely at ease in the pretty 
cities. But, as I rationalized the inter- 
mittent twinges of conscience, it 
would have been ridiculous to build 
facilities when empty accommoda- 
tions were already available, despite 
their obstinate refusal to work no 
matter how Dunlapil tried. Still, we 
managed fine and gradually came to 
ignore the anomalies we had never 
fully explored, settling down to 
make our gardens and families grow. 

T he tenth year was just be- 
ginning with surprising warmth 



VELVET FIELDS 



93 




when Martin Chavez called a meeting 
of myself, himself, and Dunlapil as 
Engineering Specialist. Chavez had 
even convened it on a Rest day, 
which was annoying as well as un- 
usual. 

“Just in case we have to call a 
meeting of the Colony,” he told me 
when I protested the scheduling. 
That statement together with his 
insistence was enough to make me 
feel apprehensive. Although Martin 
Chavez was a worrier he was no fool; 
he did not force his problems on 
anyone unnecessarily, nor was he for 
calling useless meetings. 

“I have an unusual report to make 
on a new plant growth discernible in 
the velvet fields. Commissioner Sa- 
rubbi,” he announced formally. 
“Such a manifestation is not gene- 
rally associated with a simple mono- 
cot yledonous plant. I’ve cross- 
checked both used and unused pas- 
tures, and the distortions of the 
growth in the used fields are dis- 
tressing.” 

“You mean we’ve imported a virus 
that’s mutating the indigenous 
grasses?” I asked. “Or has the old 
virus that killed off the herbivorous 
life returned?” 

“Nothing like this mutation has 
ever been classified and no, I don’t 
think it’s a repeat of a previous 
calamity,” Chavez said, frowning 
with worry. 

“Ah, c’mon, Marty,” Dunlapil said 
with some disgust. “Don’t go calling 
for a planetary quarantine just when 
we’re showing a nice credit balance.” 



Chavez drew himself up indig- 
nantly. 

“He hasn’t suggested anything of 
the sort. Dun,” I said, wondering if 
the urban engineer was annoyed be- 
cause Chavez seemed closer to solv- 
ing the enigma of the Tree than 
Dunlapil was to the mechanics of the 
cities,, “Please explain. Specialist 
Chavez.” 

“I have lately discerned a form 
of weird evolution from the family 
Graminaceae, which these plants 
have resembled until now.” He 
snapped on the handviewer and pro- 
jected a slide onto the only wall in 
my office bare of the ubiquitous 
murals. “The nodular extrusions now 
developing in the velvet fields show 
none of the characteristics of herba- 
ceous plants. No joined stems or 
slender sheathing leaves.” He looked 
around to see if we had seen enough 
before he flashed 6n a slide of 
magnified cellular material. “This 
cross-section suggests genus Helian- 
thus, an improbable mutation.” Cha- 
vez shrugged his helplessness in pre- 
senting such contradictory material. 
“However, something new is under 
every sun and we have not yet 
determined how the unusual blue 
light of this primary will affect 
growth after prolonged exposure. We 
might get a Bragae II effect.” 

“The next thing you’ll be telling 
me, Martin,” Dunlapil said as if to 
forestall a discourse on galactic com- 
parisons, “is that these plants are the 
aliens who built these cities.” He 
grinned at me.

IF 




“That ou^t to be obvious,” Cha- 
vez said with such a lack of rancor 
that the disbelief I had been enter- 
taining disappeared. “Commis- 
sioner—” Chavez’s grave eyes met 
mine— “can you give me another rea- 
son why every city has similarly 
fenced lots, all placed to catch full 
daily sun? Why the velvet fields with 
that central dominant Tree symbol 
appear to be the reverent focus of 
the aliens— excuse me— the indig- 
enous species?” 

“But they’re clearly humanoid,” 
Dunlapil said in protest. 

“Their culture is agrarian. And 
there are no grazing beasts. Nor a 
single example of that blasted Tree 
anywhere on the planet-yet!” 

That was when I truly began to 
fear. 

“There are no grazing beasts,” 
Chavez went on inexorably, “because 
they have been eliminated to protect 
the velvet fields and whatever is 
growing within them now.” 

“You mean, when those fields 
bloom with whatever it is they 
bloom with, the aliens will return?” 
Dunlapil asked. 

Chavez nodded. “If we haven’t 
irreparably altered the growth 
cycle.” 

“But that’s fantastic! An entire 
civilization can’t be dependent on a 
crazy who-knows-how-long cycle of 
plant life!” Dunlapil spluttered. 

“Nothing is impossible,” replied 
Chavez at his most didactic. 

“Your research has been suffi- 
ciently comprehensive?” I asked him, 



although I was sick with a sense of 
impending disaster. 

“As comprehensive as my limited 
equipment and knowledge allow. I 
would welcome a chance to submit 
my findings to competent xenobiolo- 
gists and xenobotanists with greater 
experience in esoteric plant-life 
forms. And I respectfully request 
that you have Colonial Central send 
us a team at once. I’m afraid that 
we’ve already done incalculable 
damage to the--” he gave a grim 
smile;, he would not make the same 
mistake 2%2dn— indigenous organism 
seeded in those fields.” 

The semantic nicety was no help 
to my frame of mind. If Chavez were 
even remotely correct, we would 
require not only xenobotanists and 
xenobiologists but an entire Investi- 
gation Team from Worlds Federated 
to examine our intrusion into a 
domain that had not, after all, been 
abandoned by its occupants like a 
Marie Celeste but was simply lying 
fallow— with the owners in residence. 

As Chavez, Dunlapil and I 
walked from my office toward the 
Comtower, I remember now that I 
felt a little foolish and very scared, 
like a child reluctant to report an 
accident to his parents but positive 
he had to risk upsetting them. The 
plastistele tower had never looked so 
out of place, so alien, so sacrilegious 
as it did now. 

“Now, wait a minute, you two,” 
Dunlapil protested. “You toow what 
an Investigation Team means—” 

“Anything and everything must be 



VELVET FIELDS 



95 




done to mitigate our offense as soon 
as possible,” Chavez said, interrupt- 
ing nervously. 

“Dammit.” Dunlapil stopped in 
his tracks. “We’ve done nothing 
wrong.” 

“We may have crippled an entire 
generation.” Chavez said with an 
expression of ineffable sorrow. 

“There are plenty of fields we 
never touched. The aliens— natives— 
can use them for food—” 

Chavez’s smile deepened and he 
gently removed Dunlapil’s hand from 
his arm. “ ‘From dust ye came, to 
dust ye shall return, and from dust 
shall ye spring again. ’” 

It was then that Dunlapil under- 
stood the enormity of our crime. 

“You mean, the plants are th^ 
people?” 

“What else have I been trying to 
explain? They are born from the 
Trees.” 



W ^E DID what we could even as 
we waited for the specialists 
and the Investigation Team to arrive. 

First we cleared the animals and 
crops from every one of the velvet 
fields. We removed every sign of our 
colonial occupation from the cities. 
The Team, composed of five non- 
human and three human species, 
arrived with menacing urgency well 
before the initial flood of xeno- 
specialists. The Team members did 
not comment on the preliminary 
efforts to repair our error, nor did 
they protest their quarters in the 



hastily erected dwellings on the bare, 
dusty plain and the subsequent roar 
ing activity of the spaceport close by. 
All they did was observe with por- 
tentous intensity. 

Of course, except for vacating the 
cities-and occupying them had been 
the least of our cumulative crimes 
—everything we did to remedy our 
trespass proved wrong in the final 
analysis. We would have been less 
destructive had we kept the cattle on 
the velvet fields and not slaughtered 
them for food. We ought to have let 
the crops ripen, die and return to the 
special soils that had nourished them. 
For the fields we stripped produced 
the worst horrors. But how were we 
to know? 

Now, of course, we do know. We 
are burdened to this very day with 
guilt and remorse for the wholesale 
dismemberment and dispersal of 
those irretrievable beings: eaten, di- 
gested, defecated upon by grazers. 
And again, eaten, digested and elimi- 
nated by those who partook of the 
grazers’ flesh. Of the countless disin- 
tegrated natives removed from their 
home soil by unwitting carriers, none 
can fruit on foreign soil. And on 
their own soil, to repeat, the fields 
we had stripped produced the worst 
horrors... 

I remember when the last report 
had been turned in to the eight 
judges comprising the Investigation 
Team. Its members wasted no further 
time in formulating their decree. I 
was called to their quarters to hear 
the verdict. As I entered the room I 



96 



IF 




saw the judges seated on a raised 
platform, several feet above my head. 
That in itself was warning that we 
had lost all status in Worlds Feder- 
ated. 

A flick of the wrist attracted my 
attention to one of the three humans 
on the Team. Humbly I craned my 
head back but he refused to glance 
down at me. 

“The investigation is complete,” 
he said in an emotionless tone. “You 
have committed the worst act of 
genocide yet to be recorded in all 
galactic history.” 

“But sir-” My protest was cut off 
by a second peremptory gesture. 

“Xenobiologists report that the 
growths in the velvet fields have 
reached the third stage in their evolu- 
tion. The parallel between this life 
form in its second stage and that of 
the cellulose fauna of Brandon II is 
inescapable.” Chavez had already 
told me of that parallel. “Now the 
plants resemble the exo-rhizomorphs 
of Planariae V and it is inevitable 
that this third stage will give way to 
the sentient life pictured in the 
murals of their cities. 

“You came here as agrarians and 
agrarians you shall be, in the fields of 
those you have mutilated. What 
final reparations will be levied against 
you, one and all, cannot be known 
until the victims of your crimes 
pronounce the penance whereby you 
may redeem your species in the eyes 
of the galaxy.” 

He stopped speaking and waved 
me away. I withdrew to announce

the verdict to my dazed fellow colo- 
nists. 

I would far rather we had been 
summarily executed then and there, 
instead of being worn and torn apart 
by bits and pieces. But that was not 
the way of judgment for those who 
trespass in modern times. 

We could not even make an appeal 
on the grounds that the planet had 
been released to us, for the Colony in 
its Charter took on all responsibility 
for its subsequent actions, having 
reaped benefits now so dearly to be 
paid for. 

So we worked from that day until 
Budding Time late that hideous fall. 
We watched anxiously as the seedling 



VELVET FIELDS 



97 




exo-rhizomorphs grew at a phe- 
nomenal rate until they were ten, 
then twenty, finally twenty-five feet 
high, thick-trunked, branching out, 
lush with green triangular foliage. By 
midsummer we knew why it was that 
during our time on Zobranoirundisi 
we had never been able to find any 
example of the Tree: such Trees grew 
once every hundred years. 'For they 
were the Trees of Life and bore the 
Fruit of Zobranoirundisi in the cellu- 
lose wombs, two to a branch, three 
to eleven branches per Tree. In the 
good fields— that is, the unviolated 
fields. 

In the others... 



T he galaxy knows we tried to 
atone for our crime. Every man, 
woman and child devoted himself to 
tending the twisted, stunted, de- 
formed, half-branched Trees that 
grew so piteously in those desecrated 
fields. Every one of us watched with 
growing apprehension and horror as 
each new day showed further evi- 
dence of the extent of our sacrilege. 
Oh, the hideous difference between 
those straight, tall Zobranoirundisi 
and— the Others. We were ready for 
any sacrifice as penance. 

Then, the morning after the first 
good frost, when the cold had 
shriveled the stems, the first Zob- 
ranoirundisi tore through his vege- 
table placenta. He shook his tall 
willowy body, turned and made 
obeisance to his natal Tree of Life, 
ate of the soil at its roots, of its 



triangular foliage.. .and knew! 

I can never retell the agony of that 
day when all those Zobranoirundisi 
faced us, their maimers, and an- 
nounced the form our expiation 
would take. We bowed our heads to 
the inevitable, for we knew the sen- 
tence to be just and of Hammurabian 
simplicity. 

We had to give back to the soil 
what we had taken from it. The 
handless Zobranoirundisi, recog- 
nizing his missing member from the 
cells now incorporated into the 
fingers of a young colony child nur- 
tured on milk from cattle fed in the 
velvet fields, had every right to re- 
claim what was undeniably his own 
flesh. The legless Zobranoirundisi 
could not be condemned to a 
crippled existence when the Ter ran 
child has used the same cells to run 
freely for seven years on land where 
previously only Zobranoirundisi had 
trod. 

We rendered, all of us, unto the 
Zobranoirundisi that which was truly 
theirs— seed and soil of the velvet 
fields, part and particle of the origi- 
nal fertilizing dust that would have 
been reconstituted during the cycle 
we had so impiously interrupted. 

Nor were we permitted to evade 
the least segment of required repara- 
tion, for all mankind watched us. I 
will say this of us proudly, though I 
no longer have a tongue: mankind 
will be able to live with its con- 
science. Not one of us, when re- 
quired, failed to give his flesh to the 
Zobranoirundisi in atonement. •

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

When the Superom moved inward 
from their origin in the Outer Vor- 
tices of the galaxy they sought 
planets like their own for habitation. 
As their skill and knowledge devel- 
oped they sought to reclaim other- 
wise inhospitable planets. Thetis was 
one of these: for its sun was burning 
out, and in the three- thousandth age 
of their appearance in the Fourth 
Vortex the Superom had developed 

101 



the artificial sun, A sun \^as erected; 
the planet wjs made ready for hu- 
manity. 

Six hundred years before the pres- 
ent an incurable plague swept 
through the Inner Vortices-a plague 
that attacked only Superom and 
none of the lesser breeds of hu- 
manity, Unreasoning fear and the 
urge of all Superom to return Jo the 
origins of the race forced the Galac- 
tic Council to order a total retreat 
from the Third and Fourth Vortices, 
and the Superom left their fabulous 
civilizations behind. 

Shortly before the retreat had 
been ordered, however, an explora- 
tory force had left Thetis for the 
Fifth Vortex. By the time it returned 
the withdrawal was already com- 
plete. The marooned Superom jour- 
neyed to the Galactic City at Man- 
danar to see if it were still possible to 
follow. But any hopes they might 
have had were destroyed by the 
The tans, who prevented them from 
leaving. The lesser human breeds felt 
that so long as Superom remained on 
Thetis, peace and prosperity would 
continue. 

Now, after a series of dark ages of 
degeneration, only four descendants 
of the original Superom of Thetis 
remain. SHE VAN, a young female 
Superom, has discovered old talk- 
tapes indicating the imminent death 
of Thetis* artificial sun. She tries to 
convince her cousin, DELBET, of the 
significance of this. But the young 
giant Superom is dull-witted, cares 
for little besides machinery, hunting 



and -in an innocent, childlike way- 
for his cousin. 

SHEVAN wishes to take the 
GREAT KAREL -a Superom pre- 
served in a casket for six centuries 
and hence a sacred symbol to most 
Thetans of their plane t*s former 
greatness-to Mandanar. There, she 
believes, the old secrets of the 
Superom are hidden. 

But the tyrannical Superom Re- 
gent of Thetis, KEREN, stands in her 
way. Any return to the old ways 
would threaten KEREN *s rule and 
the primacy of his seat of power, the 
city Spadrox. Enlisting the aid of the 
Helangles, a nomadic tribe that 
travels on mechanized *'steedes, ** he 
captures SHEVAN and DELBET. 
SHEVAN is then locked up in the 
Tower with the GREAT KAREL*s 
casket, and DELBET returns to his 
beloved machinery in the mines. 

SHEVAN persuades SHADE, a 
wraith haunting the Tower, to bring 
DELBET to -her. She tells the giant 
her plan: he is to send an apparently 
authenticated Superom message to 
all the tribes of Thetis -Helangles, 
Conducs, Saivainte and Agorans- 
announcing the Awakening of 
KAREL. 

As the tribes arrive SHEVAN 
steals from the Tower through an 
underground tunnel to talk to the 
returning DELBET. So that KEREN 
will not suspect the source of the 
fake message, she takes DELBET 
back to the Tower with her but, on 
the way there, she is sexually at- 
tacked by the Helangle dwarf ARC- 



102 



IF 




WELD. DELBET pounces on ARC- 
WELD and foils the assault, thereby 
incurring his intense hatred. 

The Day of the Awakening arrives. 
DELBET, who in hunting has devel- 
oped the ability to project his voice, 
puts words into the mouth of the 
still- frozen KAREL. KAREL is heard 
to tell the assembled multitude that 
he must be taken to Mandanar. 

KEREN is in a fury. He hears of 
ARCWELD *s frustrated adventure 
and seeks him out. ARCWELD, 
hungry for revenge on the giant and 
for power over the Regent, agrees to 
help KEREN stop SHEVAN, DEL- 
BET, and the Mandanar expedition 
that has just been mounted. To 
maintain contact KEREN gives the 
Helangle a black communicator box. 

ARCWELD, sent by the leader of 
his tribe to scout a path for the 
expedition, stops near a stone 
jungle-in actuality amiined city-to 
contact KEREN. There he is cap- 
tured by the Submetropols, a strange 
breed of humans that has lived 
underground since the time of the 
Superom. But the strange black box, 
which apparently has the Superom 
Regent trapped inside, awes them. 
They attribute supernatural powers 
to ARCWELD and he finds himself 
in a position to command them to do 
his bidding. 

Thus, when the expedition passes 
through a tunnel, at a prearranged 
moment the Submets come out of 
hiding, disrupt the caravan and cap- 
ture SHEVAN. DELBET, however, 
escapes. 



But DELBET, as well as ZED- 
WARD, an old Saivainte scholar, 
remember that the Submets at one 
time had an enemy, the witawu, 
which were attracted by short-wave 
radiation. The North Shore Conducs 
have domesticated the witawu. The 
members of the expedition decide to 
dispatch a task force to contact these 
Conducs and obtain witawu. The 
intention is to use them as a weapon 
against the Submets in order to 
rescue SHEVAN. 

The swift task force includes both 
DELBET and ARCWELD .

T he white guidelines of the road 
spun back endlessly under their 
wheels in the night. The task force 
rumbled along the main highway 
toward the stone jungle of Port West, 
then, after three hours, swerved 
north on the lateral toward the 
northwestern shore of the West 
Water. 

The headlights of Arcweld’s and 
Cleavewind’s steedes drilled cylindri- 
cal hollows in the darkness. The 
swiftest Conduc auto had been com- 
mandeered for the task force— it 
carried Delbet, Mutch and the Caxi- 
tine Conduc Homan, Apian’s son. 
Pinned between the auto’s precise 
medians of light in the The tan night, 
the rest of the task force seemed like 
a space-vehicle threading the gulf 
between galaxies. 

The dwarf and his younger Hel- 
angle companion alternated in lead- 



INHERITANCE 



103 




ing the way. When it was liis turn to 
lead, Arcweld let his stunted imagina- 
tion grope as far forward as it could. 
He made tens of plans but either 
forgot or discarded most of them. 
When he was at the rear he rode close 
enough to the Conduc auto for his 
lamp beam to pick up Delbet’s erect 
head and shoulders in the cab. 

The dwarf crouched low over his 
steering bar, head thrust forward on 
its squat neck. Behind the visor his 
eyes paid only half attention to the 
road. The rest of the time they stared 
at the giant’s skull as though Arc- 
weld’s hate were a flame that could 
bum through bone. 

Delbet showed no sign of sensing 
the dwarfs emnity. The giant hardly 
spoke. He stared ahead into the tip 
of the leading cone of light, willing 
each new contour in the road to 
surrender their destination to them. 

When he did speak it was only to 
deny two agitated appeals from 
Qeavewind for a halt. At last 
Homan, who was driving the Conduc 
auto, did force a halt. The auto^’s 
cruze fuel was overheating and the 
engine might collapse if they did not 
stop. Reluctantly the giant capitu- 
lated to Homan’s warning. 

It was nearing dawn as they pulled 
off the highway. Cleave wind was 
asleep as soon as he had stretched 
out beside his steede. Delbet and the 
Agoran Mutch slept leaning against 
one another in the auto. 

While Homan opened the recharge 
vents on the power unit of the engine 
Arcweld, sleepless and burning with 



urgency, sw^pt his bike around. He 
watched the Conduc driver for a 
moment. Without raising his visor, he 
grunted, “Gonna move on up the 
next ridge. Scout it. Dig?” 

Conduc and Helangle rarely had 
much to say to one another. Homan 
nodded briefly and turned back to 
his work. 

The dwarf gunned his engine and 
roared away, confident the noise 
would not wake the rest of the 
exhausted party. Opportunity had 
presented itself. It was time to suffer 
the screaming and scolding. 

He went a long way down the 
highway, then swung off the road 
and bumped cross-country. 

In the reddish-gray light of Thetan 
daybreak, several hundred meters ' 
from the road he found an old 
quarry. There, he was certain, no one 
could see him from the road. He 
rocked his steede up on its forkrests 
and flung off his gauntlets. Muttering 
agitatedly under his breath, he 
fumbled the pannier straps free. 

His hands shook as he set the 
controls on the box. Although it was 
so early in the morning, not more 
than five seconds passed before the 
enraged face of Keren swam to the 
surface of the screen. 

Operating the box always dis- 
turbed the dwarf. The impression of 
Keren’s physical presence it created 
challenged the senses. He backed into 
the deeper shadows of dawn, into a 
scar in the rock face. He felt less 
visible and less vulnerable there. 

He said nothing, but Keren had 



104 



IF 




been waiting ten hours for a sum- 
mons. He had already guessed the 
worst. 

He was still trapped at Spadrox, a 
virtual hostage of the Thetans since 
the episode in the Tower and the 
departure of Karel’s casket. He had 
waited sleeplessly by the transceiver 
for the call which would force his 
subjects to free him-the call which 
would mean that the casket and 
Shevan were again in his power and 
Thetis under his control. 

If his rage had been cold it would 
have frightened the dwarf, but Arc- 
weld understood violence. The Hel- 
angle laws were violent and he was 
used to living by them. After a 
moment or two of misgiving the 
dwarf began to relish the power he 
had oyer this superior creature. He 
squatted in his dark rock cleft and let 
Keren rave. He gnawed his fingers 
and grin-snarled and enjoyed the 
Superom’s impotence. 

At last Keren needed to have his 
fears confirmed. His ranting calmed. 
Then the dwarf, with studied inso- 
lence, related what had happened in 
the tunnel and afterward. 

He was careful to place the blame 
on the inferior Submets. Their failure 
to secure Delbet had forced the 
dwarf to make a change of plan. 

“Change of plan!” shouted Keren 
in renewed fury. “What change? 
Must I rely on a beat-up insect brain 
to plan for me, Keren of Thetis?” 

“If not my beat-up brain— 
whose?” Deliberately the dwarf had 
discarded the deferential form when 



addressing Keren. He squatted so 
that his face, half blanked by the 
visor, was thrust into the screen. 
“Okay. Yawl hit the road yawself. 
Bum dust! I’ll pitch the box into the 
quarry if yawl don’t need me!” 
Arcweld could not understand all 
the barbed words the Superom flung 
at him in response. 

When Keren had run dry again the 
dwarf said, “Yawl asked me about a 
change of plan. Yawl still wanta hear 
if? I don’t have much time. I got to 
get back to the truck. Light’s rising. 
I’m supposed to be taking a look at 
the road.” 

Keren’s eyes blazed but he kept 
his temper. 

“It had better work, dwarf. You 
can’t afford to fail a second time. 
Tell me. I will judge it.” 

“Who failed?” The Superom’s 
carefully worded jibe had stung the 
Helangle. “Yawl planned the am- 
bush, didn’t yawl? But not you that 
failed— not me. It was those camp 
troglos. Couldn’t hold the giant. I 
think, too. Dig? I think like 
Superom—” 

“Careful, dwarf.” 

“Yawl wanta hear my scheme or 
not?” 

“Speak,” said Keren, his voice 
choked with suppressed anger. 
Arcweld spoke. 

T WO or three times the young 
Helange, Cleavewind, seemed^un- 
certain which route was best. This 
though he was supposed to have the 
mindmap of the zone and, in any 



INHERITANCE 



105 




case, all his tribe learned as children 
to navigate by the movement and 
position of the sun. 

It was Mutch who really had the 
mindmap. 

In his youth Mutch had several 
times accompanied merchantile cara- 
vans of his people to the remote 
Conduc colonies of the North Shore. 
With the pleasurable clarity of youth 
recollected in middle age he recog- 
nized paths and landscapes— the look 
of a particular range of hills against 
the ^y— the appearance of ruined 
stone jungle that seemed pegged to 
the plain by cores of stone when 
looked at from the ridge. 

Arcweld observed Mutch’s gift 
carefully. 

At midday the party met the first 
colony of Conducs of the Western 
Shore. Homan spoke to them. They 
had heard about the Awakening and 
had recently consulted with several 
tribal groups already assembling out- 
side Port West to see the expedition 
and the casket pass. 

Delbet chose to remain out of 
sight. He impressed on Homan that 
the ambush and the kidnaping must 
be kept secret. 

The Caxitine chiefs son promptly 
invented a plausible story to explain 
the presence of the strange group of 
travelers. The Conducs were not sur- 
prised that the Superom wanted to 
get hold of some witawu elixir. 
Plenty of stories were told on the 
Western Shore about its scarcity and 
fragrant taste. It was rare and expen- 
sive, a proper food for gods. 



The Conduc leader said they had 
heard that the North Shore tribes^ 
were starting to move toward their 
longnight camps in the south. He 
believed Harvest was a good time for 
buying the elixir. It was at its best 
then. 

Homan climbed the ridge again to 
rejoin the task force. He was visibly 
pleased with himself. 

From the spine of the ridge they 
could see the sunlight firing oc- 
casional silver arrows off the swell of 
the West Water which lay like a 
green-blue stone in the distance. 

Delbet was anxious to be off. “Do 
we follow the road along this ridge?” 
Cleavewind stared at the West 
Water, glanced at the sun. “While we 
got the water there on our right 
hand, okay. Yawl check, Arcweld?” 
The dwarf was watching Mutch, 
who was standing on the cab of the 
auto. His thumbs were tucked into 
his belt. He was staring cross-coun- 
try, inland from the ridge. 

“The road bends to follow the 
shore of West Water,” Mutch said. “I 
reckon if we was to take a rough 
kind of way down there and through 
this old tract of foodland we could 
save hours of traveling. We’d bisect 
the West Water circuit road and come 
back on where it turns northwest 
toward the mountains.” 

Mutch laughed and smoothed his 
shiny head with one hand. 

“I remember-just a boy, I was— 
we’d been caught out on a plain like 
that in a rainstorm. One caravan 
time. Zut! How it rained!” He smiled 



106 



IF 




again, sweeping the past across the 
sky with a wave of his hand. 

Arcweld watched him thought- 
fully from behind his visor. 

Delbet spoke. “Good, Mutch. 
We’ll take your way.” The giant was 
ready to start. “You sit next to 
Homan and guide him. The Helangles 
may get the worst of this ride. A few 
saved hours may make the difference 
between getting Great Karel and 
Shevan back alive and . .and . .” 
The thought of the alternative ob- 
viously was too much for him. He 
gestured urgently and climbed into 
the auto. 

Cleavewind accepted the situation. 
He made the Thetan obeisance to 
Superom: palms flat against helmet. 

Surly astride his steede, Arcweld 
still watched. Mutch’s route suited 
him well enough but he must not 
show it. What he did not understand 
was the way the giant treated him. 
Surely Delbet had recognized him 
from their previous encounters. Only 
a day and a half ago Delbet had fled 
from the dwarf in the dawn on the 
hillside above the camp as though 
pursued by demons. There was no 
trace of that panic now. 

Arcweld’s mind flicked from 
possibility to possibility. Maybe, 
after all, it had had nothing to do 
with identity or recognition but had 
somehow been related to what Del- 
bet was doing there. 

But hunting talue? The dwarf 
chewed his lip reflectively. Why the 
hell feel guilty about hunting talue? 
He tried to recall each moment of 



the encounter. Although his crude 
imagination relived it again and again 
as the caravan moved on, he failed to 
detect any new clues. 

The plain looked flat and easy 
from the spine of the ridge. When 
they got down to it and began to 
cross they found malice under its 
bland surface. 

The vegetation was short enough. 
The main strains of Thetan grass 
rarely grew above twenty centi- 
meters. But they masked ridges and 
grooves where long ago the plain had 
been irrigated for a high-moisture 
crop. They shook the guts out of 
vehicles and riders. After four hours 
of bucking and bounding, Homan 
again had to insist on a halt. 

Arcweld had not slept now for 
most of two days. His Imotty limbs 
ached from controlling the bucking 
of his steede. His thighs were sore 
from bracing against the shocks 
quaking the machine. Still the chemi- 
cals leeching into his nervous system 
kept him awake. 

He sat by his bike on the ground, 
sore and panting. The sun, slipping 
down the sky, was starting to fade. 
He watched the patient Homan open- 
ing the vents on the motor again. 
Faintly acrid, the smell of warm 
cruze drifted on the air. 

The dwarf knew how quickly the 
fuel weakened if under constant 
stress. He let his mind turn this over. 
His developing ambition for power 
over Keren would be enhanced if he 
could strand the giant here in the 
wilderness. He worked with the blunt 



INHERITANCE 



107 




tools- of his imagination to picture 
how it might be brought about. The 
group was so small that outright 
treachery would reveal his hand com- 
pletely, he realized. 

He snarled with frustration. Mutch 
caught his attention. He was talking 
to Cleave wind. The Agoran was wav- 
ing his short arms about as usual. He 
seemed to be doing a lot of pointing 
in the direction of the distant tail- 
down of the ridge. Cleavewind was 
shaking his head dubiously. He, too, 
was obviously feeling the fatigue of 
the journey. 

Arcweld shut down external 
stimuli and briefly looked inward at 
his own mindmap. It was blurred and 
hazy, too dim to see what Mutch 
might be getting enthusiastic about. 
He switched back to watching Mutch 
just in time to catch a half-appealing 
look from Cleavewind. 

The dwarfs mind flicked suddenly 
and he got a picture. Another 
followed it and another. He felt a 
blush of vanity. Yes, he, a Helange, 
thought like Superom. 

He forced his sore arms to lever his 
body up and his aching legs to carry 
him half-limping, half-loping to the 
conferring pair. 

H IS determination was worth the 
pain it cost him as he had 
guessed it would be. He made his 
brain flick back over the series of 
pictures he had just seen. He wanted 
to be sure they were still there. 

He ground his teeth and snarled to 
conceal the aches racking his body. 



The look on Cleavewind’s face 
wavered between relief and unease. 

“Hi,” said the dwarf. He waited. 
He had invited himself to join the 
conversation, but he did not mean 
to contribute. 

Mutch smiled his expansive smile 
and continued with what he had 
been saying to Cleavewind. 

“Sure, I’m right. I reckon it’s 
about there, if it still exists. Now, 
why don’t we take a look—” 

“Trader says he digs this place,” 
said Cleavewind apologetically to 
Arcweld. “Says the Conducs we’re 
looking for might have a pad down 
’long the shore. Far side of that 
ridge. Reckons we ought to search 
around while we’re stopped. Save 
beatin’ farther north,” 

“I just got a feeling in my belly,” 
said Mutch conversationally. “Don’t 
ask me where it comes from, but I 
just got it. I reckon they was around 
here last time I came up on a 
caravan. But that feeling tells me— I 
can’t just pin it all down— that it was 
right there that something went 
wrong . .” 

The dwarf watched, wrinkled fin- 
gers kneading away at his aching 
groin. 

“My belly’s a pretty good guide, 
too. It ain’t often wrong.” 

“The storm,” suggested Cleave- 
wind disinterestedly. “You told us 
’bout that before. Check?” 

Mutch shook his head. 

The young Helanglb repeated, “He 
thinks we oughta search while we’re 
pulled up.” He wanted Arcweld to 



108 



IF 




take over the situation, and the 
decision. 

The dwarf looked painfully at the 
sky and the mountains. Even his 
neck ached. He noticed that the 
mountains seemed appreciably nearer 
in the waning sunlight. 

“He’s a smart fellow,” Arcweld 
said. He said it as if Mutch were not 
there. “The last time he did what his 
gut told him, we got into this ass- 
aching grassland. Sooner we make a 
road again, I dig it fine.” 

“You roadsters always did com- 
plain about shortcuts,” Mutch ban- 
tered, but sounding vaguely de- 
fensive. “Off your machines and 
roads you got no stamina. Now, 
when I was a boy—” 

“Cradpats,” blurted Arcweld 
rudely. “If it’s gonna save my balls 
from bouncing another three hours, 
rU Yide yawl to the ridge and we’ll 
take a look. But I thought yawl said 
this Conduc lot padded on the North 
Shore by the peaks.” 

“Quite right, my sawn-off friend. 
But as you heard Homan say after he 
met that last bunch, our Conduc 
brothers tend to move off the North 
Shore at this time in Harvest. Like 
the rest of us, they don’t care to sit 
in mud and cold. And there’s plenty 
of that comes down off the moun- 
tains during the longnight.” Mutch 
laughed. “No, sir. They wrap up 
their swarms of witawu and hike 
down to this shore where it don’t 
freeze and they can keep their tails 
dry. Then they’ve got the elixir just 
garnered to trade and all the little old 



witawu in nice drowsy hives. It’s all 
fine and cozy-like. Except anything 
less cozy than a witawu swarm dis- 
turbed in hibernation I personally 
wouldn’t care to imagine.” 

The dwarf kneaded away at his 
groin, pinching, jerking. He tried to 
switch back to the pictures but the 
Agoran’s own vivid images were too 
unsettling. 

“He wanted me to lift him up 
there.” Cleavewind lay back on the 
turf, giving in to exhaustion. He drew 
up his withered legs so that he 
looked like a cross between an insect 
larva and a human fetus. “I’m used 
up. I’m so balled-up tired my mind- 
map’s blanked. I just can’t take 
him.” He yawned. 

“I’ll lift yawl,” Arcweld said. 
“Hell, another hour on this ass- 
aching pitch and I quit. I just hope 
your gut’s not too reliable and we 
don’t hit your trouble. What kind 
of trouble?” 

“I can’t recall.” Mutch shook his 
head and looked over at the tail- 
down of the ridge, trying to recap- 
ture the faded memory. He stuck his 
thumbs into his belt and pushed out 
his lower lip with his tongue. 

“Let’s go,” said Arcweld. 

It looked to be less than five 
hundred meters to the tail-down of 
the ridge. But the falling sun had 
brought a slight haze with it and 
distances had become deceptive. By 
the time Arcweld had the steede 
crisscrossing up the slope they had 
covered more than a kilometer and 
Mutch was shaken speechless. 



INHERITANCE 



109 




Fortunately the impact of the 
view from the ridge top rendered 
speech superfluous. They saw that 
the old highway did run up there. 
Niutch dismounted stiffly from be- 
hind the dwarf. Arcweld levered his 
steede up onto its rest, then shoved 
up his helmet visor to get a better 
view of the broad scene. 

Peering out from below jutting 
brows, he cursed. He was half- 
blinded by the light —they were 
facing the sun. He shoved sweat and 
pain away from his face with an 
impatient gesture. His eyes focused, 
and his big jaws snapped shut in 
surprise. The mindmap flowed once 
across his consciousness with harsh 
clarity. Then it was gone again. In- 
stinct had jolted his shallow memory 
.before and it had been right. 

The West Water was close. It 
stretched away west and south as far 
as he could see. Northwest and 
north, the mountains cupped a silver 
breast of it in black hands. 

The sun had perhaps an hour until 
setting but was already a red globe in 
the mist. Under the overhang of the 
mountains, stretches of water were 
already night. 

After the relentless green ridges of 
the plain, the variations before them 
were startlingly colorful. But that 
was not what had brought Arcweld ’s 
teeth together in surprise and 
triumph. 



I MMEDIATELY below them, at 
the foot of the volcanic shale 



where water erosion had laid open 
the ridge, were visible a host of 
scarlet blooms. They were lantern- 
shaped and fist-sized and rested on 
the. hairy stalks of a plant with 
brilliant yellow foliage. 

This great canopy of color covered 
the whole of the foreshore from the 
foot of the ridge to a distance of two 
to three hundred meters into the 
ocean. Here and there the scarlet- 
and-yellow spread was broken by the 
protrusion of an egg-shaped dome. 

Out of the corner of his eye 
Arcweld glimpsed Mutch staring, 
mouth open in an astonished 0 as he 
looked down on the shimmering 
mantle. 

The Agoran flung out one of his 
extravagant gestures. “You see!” he 
breathed. He did not require an 
audience to applaud the accuracy of 
his intuition. The gesture looked as if 
it were intended for the attentive 
host of blossoms below him rather 
than for the dwarf. 

In reflex response to the eccen- 
tricity of the scene, Mutch began to 
descend as if hypnotized toward the 
frozen kaleidoscope of color. Arc- 
weld’s gesture of restraint was also 
reflex. Quickly he curtailed it. The 
absorbed Agoran saw neither it nor 
the dwarf’s quick smothering of it. 

Arcweld slammed shut his visor; 
his heart was racing. He hopped up, 
crouching on the ridge’s spine, his 
neck and helmeted head thrust for- 
ward. His aching arms felt a tingle 
spread upward from the fingers, as 
though the ground were sending him 



110 



IP 




messages. Lips drawn apart as far as 
they would stretch, saliva gathering 
at their corners, he watched Mutch’s 
descent. 

So far the Agoran had not looked 
back. His ecstatic cries floated up to 
the dwarf, some of them chopped by 
the effort of descent. 

“—Told you so— beriflame— long- 
night quarters— look at it! Perfect 
example -now I’ve got>it— ” 

Arms spread suddenly like the 
wings of a wheeling bird, Mutch 
checked himself. He had started to 
slip on the loose shale. 

As though both men were con- 
trolled by strings of the same puppet 
master, Arcweld simultaneously 
jerked out of immobility. He crab- 
scuttled sidewise, then backward, 
eyes fixed on the Agoran. The dwarf 
reached one long ape-arm behind 
him. 

Arcweld’s hand found the steering 
bar on his steede. He levered himself 
with arm-power alone, then sprang 
acrobatically. His eyes were still on 
Mutch. 

Mutch was sliding downward on 
the unstable shale. He was having 
difficulty keeping his balance. The 
Agoran ’s face was contorted by dis- 
may. His cries had ceased. Could he 
stay on his feet? 

Arcweld kicked down his steede, 
stamping the motor into life. He held 
the throttle open. 

Mutch’s short arms groped des- 
perately at the shale face for a 
handhold. He still had not made a 
sound. 



For a moment the whole scene 
was poised. Then with perfect con- 
trol the dwarf shattered it. Throttle 
wide, gears and retroactors pitted 
against one another, he let the steede 
plunge forward. At that velocity and 
so shackled, the bike’s nosewheel dug 
and flung the ground into a fountain 
less than a meter from the lip of the 
ridge. 

The picture in his mind had sprung 
into place. The flame berries. The 
dangerous spots where they thrived. 
The warning of the scarlet lantern- 
fists. 

Above Mutch the ridge crumbled. 
Lumps of shale slid away and 
stormed down. One of them, 
obedient to the malign being that 
had dispatched it, struck the trader 
in the chest. 

Birdlike again, arms flapping, his 
round body plunged. At the bottom 
he cried out once and almost scramb- 
led free of the sticky black swamp 
which nourished the beriflame. But 
the morass held him greedily. 

He continued to struggle with his 
mouth wildly open. The mechanical 
silhouette of a man above held open 
the steede’s alarm siren, drowning 
Mutch’s cries as the swamp drowned 
Mutch. 

It was swiftly over. The last thing 
to disappear into the throbbing car- 
pet of scarlet and yellow was the 
Agoran’s bald head. It parodied the 
domes of the witawu’s empty winter 
hives, eggs in the silent flames. 

Arcweld dismounted drunkenly. 
His hand remained on the siren. He 



INHERITANCE 



111 




labored backward, dragging the 
steede with him, keeping the siren 
howling. 

Homicide was unforgivable. “Not 
guilty!” cried the dwarf. The siren 
drowned his denial. “Not guilty! Not 
guilty!” 

Out on the plain they had heard 
the blood-chilling omen. Now, in the 
distance, they saw the dwarf, 
hunched and twisted against the last 
of the sun— waving, crookedly alone, 
his mouth open on a soundless plea 



M utch was gone. Delbet and 
Homan the Caxitine stood 
staring down on the carpet of flame- 
berries. Just below where they stood 
was a tumble of volcanic stjale and 
level with it a discontinuity in the 
plantation. Broken leaves and 
crushed stalks marked the spot where 
the Agoran had disappeared. 

Arcweld looked at the mountains. 
In the gathering dark they seemed to 
have hunched closer together, grown 
threatening, accusing. 

Cleavewind had dismounted from 
his steede. He was crouched by Del- 
bet and Homan, but he was not 
looking at Mutch’s grave. He was 
looking at his tribesman. 

“I didn’t remember. I was blown. 
My mindmap blanked on me. If he’d 
just -waited, kept his cool. I could 
have told him-” 

Delbet was still staring at the tide 
of beriflame that concealed the 
deadly swamp. 

“I couldn’t stop him. He flew. 



Like a bird. How could I stop him?” 

“Down there,” said Homan. “The 
domes out there are witawu hives.” 
He was addressing Delbet. 

“He saw them.” Arcweld shrilled. 
“That’s what did it. He sailed down 
there like a bird.” 

“Witawu— here?” Delbet was 
baffled. 

“Longnight quarters.” Homan 
looked away toward the mountains. 
As the sun guttered out in the 
mist-shrouded face of the water, 
night advanced across the plain. Soon 
it would be dark enough for the 
primeval Thetan sun to emerge like a 
purple ghost from its grave in the 
night sky. “The tribes won’t have 
moved dowrTfrom the mountains yet 
with the amber fog and the elixir. We 
have a long way to go to meet 
them.” 

“At least we got it now,” said 
Cleavewind. “We got the trail. The 
one they foUow down from the 
mountains every longnight. It beats 
along this shore. We just follow it. 
Dig?” 

The dwarf hawked and spat. May- 
be the death of Mutch had come too 
late. He flared his nostrils to see 
whether he could catch a whiff of 
overheated cruze from Homan’s 
auto. Pictures flicked over steadily in 
his mind. 

He stood motionless for almost a 
minute, grinning and snarling silently 
at the distant sky, before he realized 
the giant was watching him. Delbet 
had wrenched his attention away 
from the flameberries and the wita-

wu hives and was looking at Arcweld 
as if he could penetrate the dwarfs 
skull and see the pictures turning 
there. 

Arcweld shuddered suddenly. His 
bladder was distended and painful. 
He shambled away. He looked for a 
concealing rock and urinated against 
it. There had been something in the 
giant’s expression— something like re- 
cognition. Arcweld did not know 
what it meant. His brain was not 
equipped to analyze and forecast. He 
felt his hatred bubble, he felt dread 
of the giant’s power, he felt the 
insistent surge toward the new things 
he coveted. But he would have been 
unable to express any of these emo- 
tions in such terms. Only through 
instinct illuminated by the tor- 
menting pictures did he understand 
why his teeth bit into his raw lip, 
why the hair on his scalp bristled, 
why the chemicals pouring into his 
blood had kept him erect and sleep- 
less hour after hour. 

The dark came upon them quickly 
and with it exhaustion. Even Delbet, 
who showed signs of relentlessly de- 
nying everyone another night’s sleep, 
had to submit. He still had the 
Saivainte cloak he had worn during 
his exile in the mountains. He 
wrapped himself in it and was soon 
asleep, squeezed uncomfortably 
across the pilot seat in the auto. 

Homan lit a fire-ore torch to keep 
the darkness pressed back from the 
camp’s perimeter. He sat awhile, his 
back against the auto, until he too 
sank into sleep. 



Cleavewind twitched and snored 
and fought the frightful goblins freed 
by his dreams. 

For a time Arcweld remained ram- 
pant and wakeful, staring into the 
well of the sky, listening to the 
silence broken now and then by the 
sleep sounds of his companions. 
“Arnalda!” moaned Cleavewind, 
briefly desiring some dream tent- 
mate. Homan’s eyelids fluttered. He 
turned and sighed. He lay on his back 
smiling sightlessly at the infinitely 
slow constellations of his ancestry 
turning in the sky. Delbet’s hands 
twitched as he hunted talue and 
called Shevan to come and play. 

The pictures in Arcweld ’s head 
began to slow and fade. They stum- 
bled, intertwined, became confused. 
He slept. 

Only the fire-ore torch stayed 
watchfully awake. Its light did not 
reach the trembling carpet of beri- 
flame under which Mutch slept more 
soundly than any of his former com- 
panions on the ridge above. 

X 

F rom the scarlet host of lan- 
terns rose the domes of many 
moons. Slowly they waxed and 
turned. The genial face of Mutch 
wearing a mask of melancholy turned 
its eyes to watch the dwarf from 
every one of them. 

Arcweld’s hands felt swollen and 
unusable as he struggled with the 
vent covers on the Conduc auto. A 
constellation of stars peeled them- 



INHERITANCE

selves from its side. Each one burned 
like a red-hot spark as it lodged 
between his fingers. 

He wanted to cry out but knew 
that would wake the others. 

Painfully he jammed each of the 
vent covers. The big eyes of moons 
watched him from their scarlet grave. 

There was only one cover re- 
maining but each time he jammed it, 
it sprang open. With a moan he 
realized that sunk deep within it and 
trying to swim to the surface was a 
face. 

He thrust down the cover again. 
He held it over the persistent face. 
There was an ominous sound in the 
sky. With a force of a volcano the 
vent cover spurted into the air. Stars 
burned his hands again. The auto was 
gone. In its place, beckoning to the 
threatening sign in the sky, was the 
black box from his pannier. 

Keren’s face still struggled to es- 
cape from its depths but the sound 
was whirling down from the sky, 
twisting like the core of a cyclone. 
The Superom’s mouth opened in a 
final shriek of hate and fury as the 
sound in the sky co^agulated and 
funneled into the box. 

The dwarf fled from the Regent’s 
baleful glare only to find the re- 
proach of the dead Agoran cutting 
off his flight. 

Arcweld fell to his knees. Ten of 
Mutch shook their choked heads. 
Too close behind him, the sound had 
absorbed the box and now pursued 
him. A flint of rich, furred amber 
swayed, poised above him, spiraled 



down, a menacing throb. He tried to 
scream but was drowned out by a 
sirenlike wail. It was throttling him. 
He tried to open his mouth. He could 
not move. 

He fought himself awake and im- 
mediately writhed into a frozen ges- 
ture of terror. Within thirty centi- 
meters of his eyes were Delbet’s. The 
giant’s hand was over his mouth. 

The dwarf prepared to die. Above 
him the stars were already fading. 
The muscles of his cheeks and jaw 
made the plea: “Not guilty!” 

“Keep quiet. Don’t move,” said 
the giant. The commands were super- 
fluous. Arcweld could neither speak 
nor move in that grip. 

“I know you.” Delbet was so close 
the dwarf could feel the breath from 
the giant’s nostrils. “You are mis- 
taken to hold on to that grudge 
against me. When I struck you on the 
hillside above Spadrox I saved you 
from death. You were not to blame! 
How were you to know it was a 
Superom girl wrapped in that Con- 
duc caftan? But you would surely 
have died if you had harmed the girf 
You know that, don’t you?” 

Arcweld ’s eyes rolled from side to 
side. Why had the Superom giant 
crept to him in the dawn to tell him 
this? Pinned down, he could not see 
where any of the others were. He 
could not see his steede. He could 
not see whether the Superom had 
maybe broken into the pannier and 
exposed his secret. 

The giant continued to whisper 
rapidly, as though trying to beat the 



114 



IF 




daybreak. “It was you on that other 
hill, too, wasn’t it? I was hunting 
talue. You saw me. You saw what I 
could do—” 

CWELD’S eyes stopped rolling. 
His taut body shuddered. The 
terrified images in his mind slowed. 
He clawed among them for the dawn 
of two days past. He did not under- 
stand. He had tried to before and had 
failed. Pictures of the tunnel and the 
ambush and the seething, clammy 
Submets clogged his brain. 

“-why I did it,” the giant whis- 
pered. “How it was. I had to do it. I 
had to. Shewy’s smart. She’s clever. 
Playing-leastways I was playing, and 
she was searching around and moon- 
ing around and thinking around as 
usual. We found the old library. It 
had talk-tapes in it. You know what 
talk-tapes are, Helangle? She made 
me take them back to Spadrox. Then 
she spent weeks and weeks looking at 
these funny little dots and lines and 
squiggles. Then she used to tell me 
things. Stories that came out of the 
tapes into her head. I said she was 
clever, didn’t I?” 

The dwarf lay still now, not even 
struggling in the giant’s grip. He 
listened. 

“History. History it was mostly. 
All about how Thetis used to be. 
And one of the frightening things 
was— the sun was dying-eh?-sun 
dying, Arcweld! And when it went 
out-you, me, all of us-we’d all go 
with it-” 

The giant’s story continued in 



hurried whispers. How Sheyan’s ti^- 
tuition had become an obsession.^ 
How she had made him rebuild 
Keren’s disused aircar and run away 
from Spadrox with her in the first 
ill-planned attempt to reach Man- 
danar. 

“Shevan says there, right there in 
Mandanar, we’ll find the old ones’ 
secrets preserved for us^ Shewy says 
they wouldn’t have gone and just 
abandoned us. She reckons that there 
in Galactic City we’ll find the an- 
swers. You understand me, Hel- 
angle?” 

Arcweld stared at him. He blinked 
once. It might have been interpreted 
as assent. Here was another Superom 
in his hands— in the hands of a 
Thetan! The dwarf felt an excite- 
ment that made his belly tense like a 
spring. 

“So you see when Keren captured 
us he locked Shewy up. I had to go 
along with her plans then. She said 
Keren wouldn’t let us meet again. 
She said he was planning to do 
something bad to her. She had me 
make the messages and send them to 
the tribes.” 

Arcweld breathed the cool dawn 
air. It was sweet. It was aromatic. He 
breathed dowly. He was inhaling 
power itself. 

Delbet hesitated. The dwarf 
waited too. His gathering intelli- 
gence, still half-animal, waited for 
the moment to pounce on the revela- 
tion he sensed was due. 

“She said that only if Karel 
spoke— that would be the way to 




INHERITANCE 



115 




break Keren’s power. She knew that 
when I hunted talue I could pi|t my 
voice in another place—” 

The dwarf inhaled deeply. Now 
the Superom Regent could break the 
expedition. The giant was telling the 
Helangle everything he needed to 
know. All he had to do was transmit 
the information to Keren. 

“I made the voice come from the 
casket. It wasn’t Karel. It was me 
that spoke. Shevan said if I could do 
it for talue I could do it in the 
Tower. But I did it because we have 
to save Thetis. Then I saw that you 
knew. But we need your help, Hel- 
angle.” 

Arcweld breathed. 

“You harbor the grudge. You wish 
to stop the expedition because of 
me. But now you know the true 
purpose. The one Keren won’t let 
himself see.” 

Power. In. Out. Sweet, aromatic 
power. 

“You will Jielp. I need your ex- 
perience and your mindmap to find 
the witawu and rescue Shevan and 
Great Karel. I, a Superom, demand 
your confidence and your un- 
grudging help.” 

Arcweld was confused. The simple 
giant, in his innocence, had recog- 
nized and yet had failed to recognize 
the dwarfs role. 

Calmly he lifted a wrinkled paw to 
push Delbet’s hand from his lips. 

His voice croaked, “Superom are 
our masters. Now I dig. What you say 
checks. I’ll go along.” 

A smile of relief wreathed the 



giant’s innocent face. He squeezed 
Arcweld’s shoulder in one enormous 
paw. “So— we’re allies.” 

The dwarfs lips parted in an enig- 
matic ape expression. Delbet nodded, 
smiling. Suddenly, with the swift 
animal grace he had acquired from 
hunting, he faded from the dwarfs 
side into the gathering light. 

Arcweld’s expression did not 
change. He turned his head fraction- 
ally to watch the giant go. Behind 
the grin-snarl he plunged his dripping 
hands into a gashed ribcage and drew 
forth an enemy’s heart. He had the 
power at last— 

Power he could not use yet be- 
cause there was no time now to 
absent himself from the expedition. 
An hour after the sun appeared in 
the sky they were back on the 
highway that skirted the northwest 
shore of the West Water. Keren 
would be waiting and fuming at 
Spadrox, but there was no chance to 
contact him as the task force sped 
without pause first west, then north- 
east, the great black mountains 
marching steadily over the plain to 
meet them. 



AS THE doomed sun stood over- 
i\head at noon the Conduc camp 
stitched itself to a ridge on the shore 
of the West Water. 

The Conducs of the North Shore 
were grim and somber. Their dress, 
their wild eyes, the women’s hair and 
the men’s beards— all reflected some- 
thing of the harsh crags under which 



116 



IF 




they lived for most of the year. 
Arcweld, who had traveled widely 
between the enclave at Spadrox and 
the lower shores of the West Water, 
had never seen such a savage-looking 
crew. 

The Conducs suffered a shock, 
too. In their homes under the 
shadow of the mountains they were 
cut off from contact with other 
Thetan tribes. Not within the living 
memory of any of them had a 
Superom crossed their territories. So 
far as they were concerned the old 
super-race of Thetis was no more 
than a legend. They knew little and 
cared less about the traditions born 
centuries before. 

The appearance of the giant with 
his Superom eyes and black cap of 
hair, tall and forbidding as a North 
Shore crag when seen among his 
Thetan companions, proved too 
much for them. Even though they 
recognized Homan as one of their 
lowland brothers they shrank to the 
ground in fear. They bent like grass 
before the first longnight gales. It 
took Homan ten minutes of cajolery 
and persuasion to get the braver 
among them to listen to his strange 
and fearful history. 

Only the Conduc leader’s two 
older sons and one other man would 
consent to make contact. They sat 
down cross-legged in a council ring 
with Homan and the giant. They 
were scared and sullen. They kept 
their eyes fixed on the earth and 
their chins lowered to their chests. 
Thus their unkempt hair hung for- 



ward about their cheeks and screened 
them from the terror of the giant’s 
presence. 

The rest of the tribe, including its 
old and frail leader, crept away to 
the shelter of their vehicles. From 
the windows the wild eyes of one or 
two of the bolder spirits would oc- 
casionally peep fearfully at the coun- 
cil group and the strangers whose 
coming had thrown awry the simple 
pattern of their lives. 

The three Conduc nomads had not 
heard of the Awakening or the 
exodus from Spadrox. Homan pa- 
tiently explained it all. 

They listened sullenly. Life on the 
North Shore made them wary of 
strangers. They muttered and glanced 
at one another and looked from time 
to time uneasily at the place just 
outside the camp where two of their 
tribe’s sworn rivals squatted on a 
patch of dusty ground. To Conducs, 
the blank visors and insect-head hel- 
mets of the Helangles signified 
menace. 

The stories Homan had to tell did 
nothing to relieve their minds. 
Clearly they were ill at ease. Yet out 
of their planet’s past had stepped a 
legend. He had walked straight into 
their lives looking the way the laws 
said he must look, having the power 
and the authority to combine and 
lead a mixed group of Thetans. How 
could the Caxitine’s stories be mere 
invention? How could there be any 
trick? 

“So,” said Homan, “we must use 
the amber fog to flush out the 



INHERITANCE 



117 




troglodytes. They have become out- 
casts. They have committed treason. 
They have carried away the casket in 
which rests all hope for our planet’s 
future and for the return of the 
Superom from the stars. In the 
underground Submet s are masters. 
None of us could follow. But the 
amber fog will find them. It will 
drive them out with fear.” 

“Yes!” Delbet smashed his right 
fist into the palm of his left hand. 
“We shall drive out the Submet s. We 
shall force them to give up Shevan 
and Great Karel. There’s not much 
time. We must hurry back.” 

The North Shore Conducs 
flinched. Even now that Delbet had 
intervened in the council they would 
not look at him or speak to him. 

The older of the two brothers said 
something in dialect to his com- 
panions. 

Homan frowned. The three no- 
mads looked glumly at one another. 

“What do they say, Homan?” Del- 
bet leaned down, his brow wrinkled 
with anxiety. 

Homan shook his head. 

With trembling lips the younger of 
the two brothers began to talk but 
faltered and stopped. 

Once more the three North Shore 
people exchanged agonized looks. 
Finally the third man cleared his 
throat and said, “All the witawu are 
dormant, just settling for the long- 
night. They would not be of any 
use-” 

“No!” Delbet exclaimed, striking 
his thigh in agitation. “It’s better 



that way! Mutch the Agoran said 
they were fiercer when they were 
roused out of the longnight sleep—” 

The spokesman continued to 
address Homan, still not daring to 
acknowledge Delbet ’s presence. “We 
shall starve next year without the 
amber fog.” He stared sullenly at his 
companions. They scowled encour- 
agement. “There are no wild witawu 
left. If we lost our hives we could not 
breed them. We would have no elixir 
to trade to the caravans.” 

“Listen to me,” said Homan 
angrily. “Does your tribe, too, wish 
to suffer as the Submets of Westward 
City Three will suffer for their 
treachery? What would you do if we 
had brought our master Delbet Sir 
here into your camp wounded? 
Would you have dared refuse a 
Superom doctoring? Would you have 
refused him something to bind his 
wounds in order to save him from 
death?” 

The shrewdness of this appeal sank 
a barb of a different kind into 
Delbet’s unsophisticated imagination. 

He writhed. It was as if the tribes- 
men had actually denied him succor 
and the situation Homan had . hy- 
pothesized were at hand. He shot out 
one of his great hands. He, so gentle 
in all things, now in blind panic 
seemed about to break the spokes- 
man’s arm. 

“You— refuse. How dare you— ” he 
choked. 

T he Conduc shrieked. Arcweld, 
observing from a short distance 



118 



IF 




away, jerked forward. Understanding 
violence, his whole body cocked for 
the snap of bone. He thought he 
heard the swishing scuttle as the 
watchers in the nomad autos dived 
sympathetically away from the 
wrathful Superom ready to maim 
their luckless colleague. 

But Homan had grabbed his 
master’s elbow in time. 

“Wait, Delbet Sir! Wait!” He 
turned to the North Shore men. 
“You. Listen! Below ground in West- 
ward City Three creatures have re- 
verted to the primitive. They no 
longer acknowledge the power and 
greatness of the Superom. Perhaps 
they never knew it. They ambushed 
the caravan and they carried the 
Superom Shevan Lady and the casket 
of Great Karel into the underground. 

“At the Awakening in Spadrox, 
Great Karel commanded us to carry 
him to Mandanar where the casket 
would be opened at last. He revealed 
that at Galactic City lie the secrets to 
revive and restore him—” Homan 
dropped his voice. “Will it be you, 
Conduc nomads of the North Shore, 
who prevent this by blocking rescue 
from the Submets?” 

“Two hives will be enough,” Del- 
bet added urgently. “And they will 
be returned to you. If the amber fog 
is not recaptured after it has accom- 
plished its mission, then I or my 
cousin Shevan will order your 
brother tribes of the North Shore to 
replace your losses from their re- 
sources.” 

The nomads hung their heads. 



“Well?” queried Homan. 

The one who had been on the 
brink of injury could not speak. His 
teeth were still rattling. The older 
brother undertook to reply. With 
crude diplomacy he mumbled, “What 
our masters command cannot be in 
question. We ask only that our living 
be remembered. Our people would 
starve without the amber fog. We 
shall speak to our father. He will 
order that hives of the amber fog be 
given to you. Come with us. We must 
honor you in our camp.” 

The dwarf had overheard the ex- 
changes in council. Although unable 
to comprehend all, he understood 
enough. But no one would know 
that. The expression on his gnarled 
face was never easily readable. 

He and Cleavewind were supposed 
to be guarding the auto while Delbet 
and Homan pow-wowed. The first 
thought in his mind as he saw the 
five men rise to move deeper into the 
camp was that he might seize the 
opportunity to report to Keren. He 
could communicate to the Regent 
the astonishing and damning infor- 
mation Delbet had given him that 
morning. He felt sure that if he did, 
by the time the task force got back 
to the stone jungle Keren would have 
descended upon it and so would be 
waiting to abort the expedition and 
reward him. 

But he had a second thought. Now 
he could go to work on the auto to 
see whether he could rig the vents to 
bring it to a halt in some remote 
place. 



INHERITANCE 



119 




The ceaseless pictures turned in 
the dwarfs mind. He saw the giant 
stranded. He saw himself racing back 
to the stone jungle, discarding the 
deadly hives of the witawu. He saw 
himself standing before the Regent 
and receiving his reward. He saw the 
hissing, cringing Submets deliver She- 
van and the sea-emerald casket to 
him . 

Suddenly in the afternoon sunlight 
a shiver ran down the dwarfs spine. 
The Submets had been promised 
reward and protection for the raid. 
All the Regent’s threats and cunning 
had been required to screw them up 
to the point where they dared lay 
hands on Superom and the sacred 
relic: What fears might now be 
shrinking their limited intelligence as 
they cowered underground? They 
would know that the ambush had 
not achieved all that had been in- 
tended. Two days had passed with- 
out the promised arrival of the leader 
to whom they could relinguish their 
awesome captives. And all the while, 
in their dim world, no doubt the 
Superom girl-child had been har- 
assing them with her eloquence. 

Arcweld scratched and kneaded at 
his groin anxiously. If the pale 
troglos were browbeaten into re- 
vealing the authorship of the plot, an 
entirely different reception com- 
mittee might be awaiting the return 
of the task force. 

He turned his mind away from 
these nightmares. Delbet and Homan 
and the three nomads had moved far 
into the Conduc camp. Another 



council was about to start. The 
group’s old chief was helped from his 
auto. The Conducs had gained confi- 
dence and were beginning to leave 
their hiding places and gather 
around. 

The two embers of thought which 
had glowed in the dwarfs mind were 
fanned into flame by the blast of fear 
he had just felt. Evidence of the trick 
that had removed the seat of power 
from Spadrox must reach Keren. 
Armed with such evidence he could 
go immediately to Westward City 
Three. Equally, Del must be pre- 
vented from arriving before the Re- 
gent. The two thoughts were the legs 
of a single idea: he must act now. 
The dwarf preened himself. He; a 
Helangle, by marshaling thoughts and 
implementing ideas, was showing 
Superom powers. 

ARCWELD looked at the autos of 
jf\the North Shore people. The 
tracks of the battered vehicles had 
been adapted for the rough ground 
and mudflats of the northern lands. 
If he immobilized Homan’s auto the 
giant would simply commandeer one 
of the nomads’ trucks. Still, Arcweld 
felt confident that his steede would 
travel twice as fast as any of the 
beat-up transports he saw formed 
into the customary defensive ring 
around the camp. The only machine 
that could match his for speed was 
Cleavewind’s. 

The dwarf swiveled his head. He 
saw Cleavewind squatting behind the 
auto, facing the empty plain and a 



120 



IF 




silver arm of the West Water. 

Cleavewind had long ago lost 
interest in the events at the camp. A 
stubby finger scratched meaningless 
patterns in a patch of dust between 
his feet. 

“Hey, Cleave?” 

“Huh?” The young Helangle lifted 
his face. 

‘That crazy giant’s gonna start 
right on back. Soon as he gets the 
amber fog, we’ll be burning ground 
again. You better go trade cruze with 
those Conducs. We gonna need it. 
Dig?” 

The young one stared. Goggles hid 
his eyes, but the rest of his face was 
clearly sleepy. Obviously he had been 
lost in some daydream. 

“Huh? You blown your mind? We 
got enough cruze for a week. Both of 
us. What do we need with cruze?” 

“For that-” the dwarf jerked his 
head at Homan’s auto-“tickbrain! It 
burns cruze like grass. He’ll never 
make it back to the stone jungle if he 
don’t take fuel on board.” 

“So let him worry about it. Does a 
Conduc worry about how a Helangle 
runs his steede? Nix!” Cleavewind 
still had not moved his body. It 
continued to face the plain and the 
distant sweep of water. He looked 
back at Arcweld over his shoulder. 

“Go on down there and remind 
him,” Arcweld said. “Go tell him 
he’ll need to trade for cruze as well 
as amber fog. Go on. Before the 
council breaks up.” 

Cleavewind hopped to his feet. 
“Why the hell don’t you go?” 



“Because I give the orders, dig?”, 
growled the dwarf menacingly. “Go 
ahead. Burn. No, goddamn it— not on 
that. You wanna start a rumble!” 

Cleavewind had sullenly heaved his 
bike off its forkrest. 

The dwarf and the young Helangle 
faced one another in silence. A few 
seconds passed. With helmets 
jammed on tight, goggles down and 
identical black jackets studded with 
designs they looked like huge antago- 
nistic insects. 

Cleavewind chewed his lip. Arc- 
weld saw that the youngster might 
carry his defiance and his steede out 
of reach. That would destroy the 
plan. The dwarf’s heart pumped. He 
had to cajole or bully. The choice 
was clear. He was a Helangle. 

He said with unpleasant calm, 
“Yawl ever been neuro-whipped. 
Cleave?” 

Cleavewind ’s cheek twitched. 

“Listen,” said Arcweld. “Yawl 
listen, dugsucker. Me. Arcweld. I 
think like Super om. I talk to the 
stupid giant. He hears me when I 
talk. Yawl better start nodding when 
I give orders. Otherwise yawl gonna 
taste the neuro-whip when we get 
back.” 

Neither Delbet nor Shevan toted 
one of the fearsome old weapons 
from Keren’s armory-but Cleave- 
wind did not know that. With a snarl 
he shoved the bike back onto its rest. 
He went down the slope into the 
camp. 

Arcweld watched him go. The 
dwarfs lips parted over his blunt 



INHERITANCE 



121 




teeth and his nostrils dilated to drag 
air into his lungs, cramped under the 
hammering of his heart. 

There was little time. What he had 
to do must be done quickly. The 
council was less than two hundred 
meters away. He could see Delbet’s 
head and shoulders clear above the 
crowd even though the giant was 
seated. He seemed to be talking with 
some urgency, gesturing occasionally. 
His hands molded the air into shapes 
of speech. 

C LEAVEWIND had covered 
about half the distance between 
the edge of the camp and the confer- 
ence. The dwarf, reaching behind 
him, felt the step of Homan’s auto. 
He froze. He hoped that when 
Cleavewind reached the fringes of the 
listeners they would thereby be dis- 
tracted and not notice anything 
strange going on at the auto. 

Cleavewind looked back. Arcweld 
clowned angrily at him to continue 
on. 

The young Helangle hesitated and 
then with a snarl jerked forward, 
skirting the group, looking for a way 
through to Homan and the giant. 

One or two of the North Shore 
Conducs glanced at Cleavewind with 
distaste. 

The dwarf turned quickly. He 
sprang the catches securing the hatch 
over the motor, then jerked out the 
wrench in the top of his boot. He slid 
the hatch to one side, hauled himself 
upright and with two or three savage 



twists jammed shut the vents from 
the fuel cell. Sweat trickled down his 
nose under his goggles. 

He would have to jam the vents on 
the other side as well. He craned 
forward, trying to see over the com- 
pact motor, but could not sight the 
other vents accurately enough. 

Scowling and panting, he scuttled 
around the front of the vehicle. He 
paused to look into the camp. The 
group was still intact, the conference 
continuing. 

With a kind of panicky fury the 
dwarf jammed the remaining vents. 

Now that it was begun the plan 
had to be carried through. He was 
revealed, committed. Dropping into 
his ape-crouch, he sped around the 
blind side of the vehicle. His tongue 
felt dry and leathery though flecks of 
spittle gathered at the corners of his 
mouth. 

Cleavewind’s steede perched on its 
rests immediately behind the auto. 
He spun the nuts on the fuel-cell 
cover. The pungent smell of cruze 
stung his nostrils. Apart from homi- 
cide the most heinous crime aihong 
the Helangles was the theft or vandal- 
izing of a steede. Arcweld suffered a 
moment of instinctive fear as the 
cover swung down. Then he jammed 
the wrench into the exposed cell, 
tumbling backward with fright and 
pain as a great white blister of cruze 
swelled from the gash, stinging his 
eyes and singeing his gauntlet. 

. He half rolled, half scrambled to- 
ward his own bike. Now only two 
things remained: flight and the hope 



122 



IF 




that he had frustrated effective pur- 
suit. 

The camp was stirring uneasily. 
Arcweld reached his steede and 
kicked it down onto its wheels. The 
smooth blue of the sky threw back 
the roar as his foot stabbed the 
motor into life. On the ground the 
cruze from the violated cell was a 
burning star. 

He opened the throttle. The en- 
gine shrieked. There was no point in 
looking back— he had announced 
himself at last. But as he wrenched 
the bike around and the sky spun in 
sympathy he found that an image of 
the camp froze into one stopped 
instant of time in his head. 

A field of faces in fixed surprise. 
The faces had turned to him as the 
flowers of the plain turn to the sun. 
From among them glared the hand- 
some Superom face of Delbet. He 
strode forward, at first indignantly, 
then with passionate urgency. The 
picture moved. The giant broke into 
a run.. The sky whirled above the 
dwarf and now the road and the 
plain opened before him-leaves of a 
book wiped clean. 

Arcweld flew. 

T he Helangles rode in packs, 
scouted in parties. It was twenty 
years since Arcweld had ridden alone 
with any considerable journey before 
him, twenty years since he had 
traveled ritually into a stone jungle 
to serve the night of his manhood. 
Daybreak the next morning had 
found him flying. He flew now as he 



had then, with the sky pouring back 
the sound of his steede. The same 
dream-demons pursued him: the fire 
and wrath of the unknown future 
and the impenetrable past. 

He must stop and use the box to 
summon Keren out of Spadrox but 
he knew that first he must open a 
wide gulf between himself and pur- 
suit. Otherwise he might be over- 
taken while making the call. 

He feared the route by the West 
Water along the ridge where Mutch 
had died. On the other hand the 
harsh ridged plain might delay him. 
Worse,- it might damage his steede. 
He held to the road. 

The sun was descending. Behind 
him the horizon had swallowed the 
last view of the North Shore Conduc 
camp. The sweep of the old highway 
was as empty as the surface of the 
West Water itself. The dwarf flew, 
crouched like a jockey. The wind 
tore at his helmet. His teeth were 
bared and the vibrating motor like a 
part of him. 

As he sped down an incline and 
catapulted up the other side he re- 
cognized the field of beriflame across 
the bay. His heart slurred. “Not 
guilty!” Even as he mumbled the 
words his hands closed spasmodically 
on the retroactors. 

The steede slewed halfway across 
the highway with a screech and a 
whinny. The motor stalled. 

The dwarf teetered crazily but 
stuck to the saddle. He sat snarling 
and yickering like a beast, as though 
the old demons of his youth had

vaulted twenty years and blockaded 
the road ahead. 

Above the scarlet field and the 
gleaming witawu hives, a number of 
halted vehicles were strung along the 
ridge. Even at this distance they were 
identifiable as those of Conduc no- 
mads. 

The punished motor of his steede, 
restarted, was whimpering only a 
little ICuder than the dwarf. Again it 
stalled. But his panic had cooled 
enough for him to realize that the 
camp ahead was part of the annual 
migration from the north. This group 
must have come in across the plain 
during the morning. Delbet’s party 
had missed a meeting with them by a 
few hours. Arcweld looked back at 
last. Empty road, empty plain. 

The camp had caught the sound of 
his approach through the vast loneli- 
ness. One or two of the shaggy 
nomads were standing in the road; 
others had climbed onto their autos. 
Movement in the field drew Arc- 
weld’s attention to a pair of crude, 
boats floating among the flame- 
berries between the hives. Their Con- 
duc crews stood up to look. The 
boats were full of gently pulsing 
things that looked like giant sponges. 

The grave, bearded nomads stared 
at the distant apparition. They 
looked at one another. A Helangle— 
alone? 

ARCWELD SPAT. With his with- 
in ered leg as a crank he thrust the 
motor, into life again, opened the 
drive and retroactors together. The 



steede leaped forward over the high- 
way like a hunting tree-tiger, landed 
on the embankment, hurtled down 
the far side and into the plain. 

The dwarf intended to describe a 
loop around the camp and rejoin the 
highway further south. But having 
made some two kilometers he caught 
sight of a ruined escarpment and the 
dry canals of one of the old irrigation 
reservoirs. He sent the bike bouncing 
into one of the dust-filled ducts, 
drove a little way on and stopped. 
The trench seemed deep enough to 
hide him from anyone on the ridge 
highway. 

He looked around. The silence was 
enormous after the din of the motor. 
Yes, he was out of sight from the 
ridge. This was a better place than 
most for making his call to Keren. 

He threw off his gauntlets, swung 
stiffly from the saddle of his steede. 
Opening the pannier, he set the box 
on the ground. Crouching, with thick 
fingers he did what Keren had taught 
him to do to the knobs and switches. 

He waited. His breath was the 
noisiest thing in the great silence. 
Sweat running from under his helmet 
and visor had streaked the dust on 
his face. The distorted reflection of a 
savage looked at him from the curve 
of the box’s screen. 

Now the screen began to fill with 
its own particular darkness. The 
dwarf waited, twisting his face ner- 
vously, shrugging, fidgeting while the 
box hummed. Still nothing swam to 
the surface of the pool at its center. 
The Regent was a long time answer- 



124 



IF 




ing the call. Arcweld spat into the 
dust. His right hand kneaded away at 
his groin, coaxing, comforting. 

He pushed again the switch which 
summoned his master. He lifted his 
head, anxiously staring up at the sun. 
Keren might be eating but the pul- 
sator on his wrist should alert him at 
any time. A tiny glacier of fear began 
to spread from the pit of the dwarfs 
stomach. 

If something had happened to the 
Regent, Arcweld was alone. Alone. 
Even his breath no longer broke the 
silence. Alone he could not frustrate 
the expedition. Nor could he rejoin 
it. 

In fear the dwarf struck the box. 
“Come! Keren! Yawl bearded crad- 
pat Superom bastard. Come!” 

A little dust rolled from the cracks 
in the stones of the dead canal. The 
hum seemed louder. 

“Dwarf—” said the box. “Is it 
you? You, at last, you stunted, mis- 
conceived—” 

“Keren Sir!” Arcweld added the 
respectful suffix in sheer relief. “I 
can’t see you.” 

“I’m here. You’ve turned the box 
into the sun. Turn it with its back to 
the sun, you misshapen animal. 
Where have you been? What have 
you done?” 

“Listen,” the dwarf breathed. 
“Yawl listen good, Regent.” His arro- 
gance was returning. He hopped 
about with excitement. “Ain’t much 
time. The Agoran got drowned. We 
got to a North Shore Conduc camp. I 
busted the Homan kid’s auto and my 



man’s steede so they couldn’t 
follow.” 

Keren’s bearded face was visible at 
last. Its hollow eyes stared at the 
capering, twisted shadow he had 
made into an ally. 

“I got all you need to bust the 
whole thing wide. After I killed— ah— 
after Mutch got drowned the dumb 
giant came to me one morning—” 

The humming had gathered 
strength. There was more than the 
sound of two voices. 

“He said-” 

“Speak louder, dwarf. What’s that 
whirring sound?” 

It was gaining power with every 
second. Arcweld stopped. Clearly the 
source was not the box. It was the 
sky. The sky! 

The dwarf stared at the turning 
blue bowl. All day it had followed 
him, watching him, empty, polished; 
now over the West Water behind him 
it had become blemished. It had 
grown three clumps of fungi that 
screwed great cone-shaped cavities in 
its inscrutable face. And there was no 
mistaking where they pointed. 

Keren was shouting a word. In the 
instant of panic before he realized 
what the word was, Arcweld tried to 
‘remember where he had seen the 
purposeful fungi before. In a 
dream— a nightmare? 

His shriek and Keren’s angry cry 
came simultaneously. 

“Witawu!” ^ 

“The amber fog!” 

“The transceiver! Those things are 
attracted by radio short-wave. Switch 



INHERITANCE 



125 




it off, you dolt!” howled the Regent. 

But it was too late. The dwarf had 
gathered the precious magic box in 
his arms and was no longer listening. 

I N loud cones the witawu sped 
over the plain. The first stimulus 
from the box had jabbed them out of 
the drowsy prelude to their longnight 
sleep. They terrified their keepers, 
spiraling from the hives and the boats 
as though Harvest had never come. A 
thousand generations had not 
blunted the deep instinct that the 
radio waves had triggered. The wita- 
wu flew unerringly inland, called by 
an echo from the past. 

“Dwarf! They’ll destroy you! 
Switch it off!” 

Arcweld might have been deaf. 
Crazed by panic, he could not relin- 
quish the magic the Superom had 
entrusted to him. While Keren 
screamed warning after warning, the 
dwarf fought to get the box into the 
pannier. Foam flecked his lips. He 
was beyond the reach of the Regent’s 
voice or anything else. 

Arcweld slammed shut his visor 
and sprang into the saddle. The first 
witawu swarm, buzzing expectantly, 
bored down through the radio waves 
flooding from the strange object be- 
low. 

“Aahhg-” Striking at the hard 
bodies and invisible wings was use- 
less. They swarmed over the dwarf. 
His gauntlets lay somewhere on the 
ground; a dozen white-hot needles 
sank into his unprotected hands. He 
could not see properly through the 



mass of amber that had settled on his 
goggles and visor. 

Wildly his leg cranked the steede 
alive. Thousands of witawu were 
flung momentarily into the air. They 
collided with the next swarm ar- 
riving. Thousands more clung to bike 
and rider. A great pendulous mass of 
winged bodies, like some obscene 
growth, fought to get into the 
pannier. 

Their weight unbalanced the bike. 
It careened from side to side, striking 
the banks, sending down storms of 
dust as the dwarf tried to escape 
from the gully to the plain. 

All the folk of the Conduc group 
except those still aboard their boats 
in the beriflame field climbed to the 
highway atop the ridge. They stared 
up at the sky and over the plateau, 
seeking an explanation for the flight 
of their witawu, and exchanging 
brittle cries of astonishment and dis- 
belief And there, dotted along the 
ridge like a theater audience, they 
watched the final act of the night- 
mare that had begun at dawn three 
days earlier on a hillside above West- 
ward City Three. 

In the still afternoon light the 
cloud of insects circled. They whirled 
and eddied, rose and fell, blew like 
wind-driven smoke. 

At first it looked as though the 
swarms were consolidating to tow 
something along the ground. They 
swirled, expanded, massed, dived up- 
on the earthbound object. They 
covered it with throbbing amber. It 
seemed as if they were trying to drag 



126 



IF 




it back as a prize to the Conduc 
camp. 

Then one of the sharper nomads 
realized the witawu were not towing 
it— it was towing them. 

He called out to a companion. The 
man nodded. They were remember- 
ing the solitary Helangle who had 
appeared mysteriously on the road 
twenty minutes ago. Now the ap- 
proaching shape, clouded and dis- 
torted by the swarming insects, was 
becoming recognizably a Helangle 
steede and rider. Now, too, the 
sound- of the motor was clear, al- 
though the frenzied din of the wita- 
wu challenged it. The infested bike 
and its pilot reeled crazily across the 
plain. 

The dwarf dared not scream. The 
amber insects were everywhere and 
would not stop at exploring an open 
mouth. The dreams in Arcweld’s 
mind had become molten and he 
could no longer control the pictures. 
But he kept his lips shut. Time after 
time he sought to raise one stung, 
swollen hand to brush the insects 
from his goggles and try to see where 
he was going. 

In desperation he opened the 
throttle wide. The bike bucked and 
plunged. He had to lean this way and 
that to counter the crowding weight 
of witawu dragging the bike off 
balance. He was incapable of under- 
standing that cutting the pannier free 
would rid him of the attackers, 
though every thread of instinct left 
to him was concentrated on his own 
survival. 



The bike screamed forward, lurch- 
ing from side to side. The amber fog 
thinned and scattered but quickly 
reformed. Hot-wire stings sank into 
the dwarfs hands, chin, neck. 

The steede bounced high on the 
washboard surface of the plateau. 
Witawu swarmed about the Helangle, 
circling, settling, rising and swirling, 
buzzing furiously. 

The people on the ridge watched 
woodenly, aware that they could not 
help even if they wanted to. They, 
better than any other Thetans, knew 
the unmanageable fury of the witawu 
swarms. Arcweld was beyond aid. 

For half a minute they watched as 
the steede zigzagged toward them, 
sometimes airborne, sometimes 
earthbound. Then one Conduc 
shrieked and waved his arms. They 
scattered. Men and woman grabbed 
their children and dived for safety. 

A swath of sparks flew into the 
air. One of its steering bars had 
sideswiped a rock as the bike had 
keeled over almost parallel to the 
ground. Somehow Arcweld righted 
it. The motor roared again. The bike 
dipped and then leaped up the ridge. 

Thousands of witawu still clung to 
Helangle and steede. It struck the 
ridge top and bounced against one of 
the Conduc autos. Tiny but real stars 
showered from the constellation 
painted on the steede’s side. The 
dwarf was flung forward but some- 
how held on as the bike touched the 
highway. 

He could see nothing, hear 
nothing. He was totally covered now 



INHERITANCE 



127 




by stinging, buzzing witawu. His 
every muscle and nerve were com- 
mitted to blind flight. 

Convulsively his right hand wrung 
the throttle. With a protesting howl 
the steede sprang forward. Its wheels 
struck ground on the far side of the 
road. Thousands of witawu rose in 
instinctive self-preservation from the 
doomed steede and its misshapen 
rider. They soared skyward, sepa- 
rated at last, hung, then plunged into 
the water less than ten meters from 
the field of flameberries. 

A great hiss, suddenly extin- 
guished, made the Conducs cover 
their heads. A plume of water shot 
skyward and fell back to the surface 
in watm rain. 

When they dared look again, the 
columns of bubbles rising from the 
bottom were moving slowly out to 
sea. 

The sun watched from the gather- 
ing mist with a single, unblinking 
eye. 

Above the place where Arcweld 
had disappeared the witawu circled, 
droning sullenly, sorting themselves 
into their proper swarms. The lan- 
guor of Harvest resettled over land 
and sky now that the call of the 
radio waves had ceased. 

Book Three: DELBET 

XI 

H e felt scared when she looked 
at him that way. Before she had 



been old enough to be called Lady, 
she used to scratch and bite and kick 
when he teased her and she got really 
angry. 

She did not do such things any 
more. Now the kicks and bites and 
scratches came in her words and 
from her eyes. 

They hurt as bad. Worse, maybe. 
They gave you the same feeling you 
got when you met up with a tree 
tigress nursing cubs and did not have 
your slingbow. 

She was pretty as a tree-tiger cub, 
too. Real pretty. Especially when she 
was angry. 

“What did you tell himT*’ she said. 
“What did you say fo him, Del?” 

The giant locked his big hands 
between his knees and squeezed till 
the joints cracked. He did not know 
how to lie. “Why, Shev—I didn’t tell 
him anything more than he’d already 
seen or guessed. I could see all the 
time he was mad-nursing something 
inside— like about that night when 
he-” 

“What?” She spoke softly but 
with menace. It was like a faraway 
thunderclap. 

“Why, that night when you came 
down into the camp dressed up like a 
Conduc and—” 

“No, not that!” The words 
slammed shut on the memory. 
“What? What did you tell him?” 

Del looked up at the sky. It was a 
dome streaked with clouds— whorls, 
anagrams of vapor. A Harvest sky, 
hugging storms. 

The deck of the vessel throbbed to 



128 







the beat of the crude stern-mounted 
engine. Delbet shifted uneasily. 

“He could have wrecked the task 
force, Shev. He was plotting all the 
time. 

“What? What, I asked you. Not 
why.” 

“Well— I told him how ft was. 
About Msindanar and about how you 
read in the library about the sun 
running down and-well-nothing 
much, really. Nothing I didn’t have 
to.” He cracked his knuckles again. 
He stared at morning and the face of 
storms in the sky. 

“And?” 

“Well, Shewy-” 

“You told him about the Tower 
and the Awakening. You told him 
that, too. Didn’t you?” 

“Shewy-” 

“You dummy! You witless, long- 
legged spitfly! I should have left you 
in Spadrox with Keren right from the 
start. A talue’s got more sense—” 

“I had to do it, Shev. The morning 
before we went down into Westward 
City Three he saw me. He was in the 
scrub up there on the mountain. 1 
didn’t tell you before. I’d broken 
camp to go hunt talue. He saw me, 
all right. He heard me pitch the call. 
He was a Helangle but he wasn’t like 
an ordinary Helangle.” 

“And you: You!” The girl threw 
all her fury into the words. Although 
she *and Delbet were alone on the 
high deck in the prow of the boat 
and talking Superom, the well deck 
below and behind them was crowded 
with Thetans. Any other violence 

INHERITANCE 



would have betrayed their dis- 
harmony. “And you -are not 
Superom! You would have done 
better working the cruze mine!” 

He stretched one arm to restrain 
her, but the expression on her face 
froze him. 

“Listen,” she said. “I told those 
lining, colorless, slimy creatures 
everything that was going to happen 
to them if they didn’t return me and 
the casket to the surface right away. 
I intuited they were waiting for 
someone— someone who had prom- 
ised to come but hadn’t. After two 
days they were really scared. And do 
you know what they told me? They 
told me a dwarf was in the city on 
the morning of the ambush. A Hel- 
angle who opened his mouth like 
this-” She snarled, drawing back her 
lips in a spectral imitation of Arc- 
weld. “They said he had a magic box. 
A box like those theif ancestors 
sometimes tended below ground for 
the masters. They said it had a 
Superom prisoner inside it. Eh? 
You-do you know what that 
means?” 

The giant stared at her. He was too 
scared to think. He always became 
fearful when Shewy got angry. He 
swallowed and shook his head. 

“He was spying for Keren,” said 
the girl. “Keren got to him at the 
Spadrox gathering. He sent him on 
the expedition with a transceiver. 
They fixed the ambush. The Submets 
should have got you, too. You realize 
that, don’t you? When they had us 
down underground the dwarf was 

129 




going to bring Keren flying. That 
would have finished us all!” 

Delbet’s face flushed. His mouth 
opened and shut. Then everything 
softened into a huge grin of relief. 

“But he’s dead, Shev. Gone! The 
witawu got him. He drove off the 
cliff into the water. A whole tribe of 
North Shore Conducs saw him go 
under. It was right near where Mutch 
drowned. He’s dead. We don’t have 
anything to fear from him,” 

“Oh, Delbet.” The girl shook her 
head. Her anger was melting into pity 
for the big simple man. “The dwarf 
probably told Keren everything. The 
one way Keren can get out of Spad- 
rox is by convincing the The tans we 
tricked them in order to carry off 
Karel’s casket. If the dwarf gave him 
your-ypur confession, he’ll use it. 
He’ll be on his way now to break the 
expedition.” 

Delbet listened glumly as the girl 
spoke on. 

“Why do you think I insisted on 
traveling through the night to Port 
West as soon as you got back to the 
city? Why did I bully the Water 
Conducs to take the expedition in 
their fleet and sail before sunrise?” 
Delbet stared down at the deck. 
“Well-Shev-Keren’s not here. And I 
guess he could have been if he 
wanted. After all, he has the aircar.” 
Shevan looked up at the sky. It 
was empty. 

AROUND them the morning sea 
was white-winged with a fleet of 



vessels. The waters throbbed with the 
beat of their engines. Their square 
sails flapped, sucking for a breeze. 

Even though many thousands of 
Thetans had gathered at Port West to 
see the expedition off, it had taken 
Shevan’s fierce persuasion and the 
stem words of Floridian, their chief, 
to raise the Water Conducs and their 
fleet before dawn. Thetans had been 
afraid of the dark since the lights of 
the Superom had gone out six hun- 
dred years ago. 

None of the sea-harvesters had 
ever sailed to the far shore of the 
West Water. None could say what 
was there. Delbet had found the 
North Shore people suspicious of the 
unfamiliar, the people of the fishing 
waters to the south reluctant to risk 
their boats and thus their livelihood. 

But Shewy with her soaring 
passion-the awesomeness of the 
mysterious casket , carrying a sup- 
posedly living Superom of the Great 
Age— the legends of the Superom’s 
return recalled aloud by Floridian, 
these had finally spmng the sailors 
from their beds and families. 

The sea stretched before them, 
unbroken by any sight of land. The 
sun had risen only a short time 
before, a sun dispirited as if sensing 
its own mortality. Before long, the 
loops and trails of cloud spun into a 
sheet masking the sunlight. A squall 
twisted down from the north. 

Stirred by invisible spoons of 
wind, the heaving water sent the 
boats reeling. Sails slapped, and can- 
vas tore, ropes parted. A single ex- 



130 



IF 




plosion of thunder was drowned by 
rain. The cruze-powered engines con- 
tinued to churn the boiling waves but 
their thrust was puny in contest with 
the wild water and wind. 

The Conduc sailors had been 
caught off guard by the sudden 
storm. Only one or two crews got 
canvas down and trimmed their boats 
in time to run before the wind. 

Two or three vessels were 
swamped. Another, broadside to the 
wind, capsized. The Conduc autos 
and Helangle steedes and terrified 
cadels and tribesmen thrashed and 
sank together. 

The storm wrought its havoc for 
about ten minutes. Then, outrunning 
the surviving vessels, it churned away 
southward, an angry colossus of 
wind, mist and rain scudding across 
the face of the sea. 

The boat that carried Delbet and 
Sheyan pitched and rolled in the 
quieting wake of the squall. 

Varso, th^ Conduc fleet captain, 
climbed painfully to the foredeck. 
He was long-haired and bearded, as 
were all the Conducs. His huge deep- 
set eyes had dark bags of fatigue 
under them. A metal collar engraved 
with the tribal constellation indi- 
cated his office. He had fallen heavily 
during the storm. His left arm was 
bruised and the hand swollen. 

The two Superom cousins watched 
him. Delbet did not feel sick because 
nothing unsettled him, but Shevan 
had to bite her lips and dig her nails 
into the palms of her clenched fists 
to hold down her nausea. 



Varso raised his uninjured hand in 
salute. “We’re going about, Delbet 
Sir. There may be survivors.” 

The giant started to nod his agree- 
ment but Shevan said, “No!” 

Varso looked at her blankly. So 
did Delbet, his mouth hanging open. 

“No. We must go on. Five 
minutes, and probably there’ll be 
another storm.” 

“But-” Varso gestured at the sky. 
Delbet followed the gesture. The sky 
was as innocent and cloudless as a 
child’s eyes. 

“Go on I say!” Sheyan’s face was 
ashen but her voice had an edge like 
broken glass. “Go on, I will not have 
the casket endangered.” 

Varso glanced appealingly at Del- 
bet. The giant turned away. In the 
storm he had pushed Shewy under 
one of the bulwarks and held her 
there. He was soaked and battered. 
His black cap of hair had been torn 
apart. Strands of it were matted to 
his ears and forehead. Mandanar 
seemed a million years away in an- 
other galaxy, the journey purpose- 
less, the pain and hazards f^utile. 

The Conduc fleet captain stood 
motionless. He seemed stunned. 

“Go on!” Shevan insisted. 

Then, as though she commanded 
some supernatural power, the 
weather spoke irrevocably.. Shrouds 
and webs of mist unexpectedly spun 
from the north to wrap the sun 
again. A new wind shrieked down at 
them, flinging the vaporous Thetan 
rain and the mounting waves against 
what remained of the fleet. 



INHERITANCE 



131 




From pale sunshine to the heart of 
fury was a few seconds’ transition. 
This time the remnant boats were 
already pointed to run from the 
storm. None was swamped or cap- 
sized. 

The giant once again held the girl 
against the bulwark with his body. 
She clung to him, moaning, her face 
pressed into his belly. The rain was 
almost fine enough to breathe and 
drown in. It was as if Keren had 
invoked some secret meteorology of 
his own to wreck them all. 

This time the storm lasted longer. 
When at last it had funneled away 
into silence and the sky hung out the 
watery sun, the fleet was .well 
scattered. Vessels dotted the south- 
ward vista. 

From the command deck in the 
stern Varso’s dark eyes stared 
sullenly forward at the two Superom, 
but he did not approach them again. 
The threat of another storm brewing 
in the north was enough to stifle 
thoughts of turning back. 

The flotilla leader signaled the 
scattered craft to crowd on power 
and run south. He did not look 
behind. Anyone who had survived in 
the water after the first squall would 
have a long swim ahead of him. 

The enginemen coaxed their crude 
motors to peak effort. The boats 
ploughed through the water. The sea 
was still choppy and fidgety from the 
violence that had seized it not long 
ago. 

More squalls developed through 
the morning but they ran farther and 



farther eastward. The flotilla did not 
have to change course again. 

Still, it was well into afternoon 
before the lookout shouted, “Land!” 
Slowly the two wings of the Bay of 
Anselm came into view, like a giant 
claw reaching to grab the flotilla. 



ALTHOUGH the sun was shining 
jl \ brightly now and the only rem- 
nant of squall was tumbling like a 
boiling cloud along the eastward 
horizon, the bay looked threatening. 
Behind it extended the great cracked 
stone jungle of the old Superom 
from which the bay took its name. 
The new Anselm, where a South 
Shore Conduc tribe had settled to 
establish a fishing colony, included 
the foreshore and the patched jetties 
and piers of the old city. Dark lifeless 
hills hunched around it. 

Varso had obviously been to An- 
selm before. His boat was recognized 
while still a long way offshore. The 
Anselm folk stopped their work and 
waved and shouted. Varso took the 
flotilla close in. The inhabitants ob- 
viously knew which pier he would 
choose and began to crowd it. 

There were eight boats left of the 
twelve that had set out from Port 
West. Varso jumped ashore to be 
greeted by the colonial chief. Men, 
women and children pressed forward, 
excitedly staring at the Superom. 
Varso held a shouted conversation in 
dialect with some of the elders. 
There was a good deal of wise 
nodding and gesticulation, fist- 



132 



IF 




brandishing and finger-pointing at sea 
and sky. 

‘‘They say we should shelter here 
tonight,” Varso told Shevan. “They 
have good reason. Morning storms 
are often followed by evening storms 
on the West Water.” 

Varso stared at his feet. Few 
Thetans who had faced Shevan once 
in disagreement were likely to try it a 
second time. 

Shevan was looking at the sky. 
Delbet followed her gaze. All the 
enemies bom of time were on high. 
The old senile sun. The fading artifi- 
cial sun of the Super om. The silent 
dome of blue that reminded him of 
the old observatory dome with its 
fragmented inscription. The image of 
Keren, looming in the gaint’s imagi- 
nation like a storm cloud... 

“Besides,” t|ie Water Conduc said, 
seeing Shevan’s hesitancy. “We shall 
need all the light left today to repair 
our damaged boats.” 

“Very well. But you must rig 
fire-ore lamps, as many as are neces- 
sary, and work through the dark if 
need be. We must leave at dawn 
tomorrow. This expedition must be 
on the far side of the West Water by 
tomorrow night. We must cross the 
Graystones before the beginning of 
longnight. That is not far away.” 

Shasem, the Anselm chief, 
scratched his beard and spoke briefly 
to Varso. The South Shore dialects 
were further removed from the The- 
tan tongues of the Western Shore. 
Shevan had difficulty foUowing the 
chief*s words. 

INHERITANCE 



Zedward the Saivainte, who had 
survived the storm in the flotilla’s 
flagship, leaned toward Shevan and 
murmured, “Although he is difficult 
to understand, Shevan Lady, I be- 
lieve that he says the journey from 
Anselm to the far shore will take at 
least two and a half days. He gives 
the reason but I do not—” 

The girl’s eyes blazed at Varso. 
“Nonsense!” she exploded. “The 
books and the maps say that it’s a 
day’s journey. It is two days’ time 
direct by vessel from Port West. How 
can it be longer from here?” 

Varso spoke in quick, broken sen- 
tences to Shasem. The South Shore 
fisherman listened. His cheeks had 
paled with fear when the Superom 
demigoddess spoke in anger, but his 
eyes were stubborn. 

Shevan listened impatiently. All 
the other Thetans crowding the deck 
of the vessel in council kept their 
eyes lowered. 

“Well?” 

“There is no waterway from An- 
selm-” Varso spoke rushed and 
fearful phrases-“other than the way 
that skirts the Place of Rocks, Vamin 
Darma. No Conduc of these waters 
will cross it although it is said to be 
possible. They fear. They fear the 
monster Khedau.” 

The fisher Conducs hissed at one 
another when they heard the name. 
Heads shook, bearded chins raised 
and eyes peered fearfully past the 
claw of headland into the westward 
sea distances. 

“Khedau?” 




Another ripple of fear and discon- 
tent. 

“What is this Khedau?” 

With as much gravity and poise as 
Zedward himself might have mus- 
tered the colonial chief said some- 
thing in his own dialect which never- 
theless needed no translation. 

“Khedau is Khedau!” 

Faced with the fear behind the 
monumental simplicity of the old 
man, Shevan was silent for several 
seconds. Then the Superom intelli- 
gence asserted itself again. 

“Listen to me.” She raised her 
voice. “All of you who can under- 
stand, hear me. I, Shevan, a true fruit 
of the Superom, am a monster more 
terrible than this Khedau. And I go 
to Mandanar where I shall find the 
means to recreate the power of the 
Superom so that Thetis shall be great 
again. 

“Also I carry with me the secret 
mind of my forefathers. Its knowl- 
edge is enshrined in the living body 
of Karel, the same Great Karel who 
lived among Thetans when Thetis 
was great. 

“Del, tell them to bring the casket 
on deck!” 

A PARTY of Caxitine Conducs 
L helped by several Agorans man- 
handled the casket from its place of 
safety to the deck. The fisher Con- 
ducs of Anselm hung their heads. 
The awed silence that descended 
upon the Thetans in Varso’s boat 
radiated outward to the other boats 
and then along the piers and jetties 



and through the Longshore colony. 
The old crumbling stone jungje 
seemed to move a few paces closer to 
the sea. The clap of wind on rope 
and the slap of water on shore and 
hulls and piers were the only sounds 
in the bay. 

In the silence the casket shone 
ghostlike. Inside its sea-deep emerald 
light the old man slept. The fluctu- 
ating levels of the instruments set 
into the casket confirmed the flicker 
of life preserved for six centuries. 

Shevan spoke again. 

“These are my powers. At Spad- 
rox on Awakening Day, Karel spoke. 
The message was that we should bear 
his casket to Mandanar. These are my 
powers! I and Delbet Sir, my cousin, 
are Superom. Superom who made 
Thetis and colonized Thetis do not 
fear any monster of Thetis.” 

Delbet stared sideways at her. Al- 
ways when she was opposed the fury 
coiled up tight inside her. It made 
her slender frame quiver like a hunt- 
ing animal’s, poised and ready under 
the taut blue suit. 

The giant stared miserably at the 
enormous peace within the casket 
that could impose silence on the 
whole colony and bay. Only he and 
his cousin knew the truth of the 
speech on the Awakening— now when 
^e spoke deception was heard as 
truth. Delbet shivered, remembering 
how he had foolishly taken the dwarf 
Arcweld into his confidence. If what 
Shevan had guessed were true per- 
haps one other knew the truth about 
Karel’s Awakening. Keren might be 




planning now to follow them from 
Spadrox. He might even be on his 
way. 

Shevan finished speaking. Once 
more the casket created silence. 
Finally Shasem whispered a few sen- 
tences hoarsely to Varso. 

“Well?” said Shevan. “What does 
he say now?” 

The flotilla leader cleared his 
throat. 

“My brother says that he gives 
reverence to Great Karel. He says 
that he rejoices in the mission to 
recreate Thetis. He says that he 
respects the powers you are gifted 
with. But he says that none of the 
Conducs of the South Shore Anselm 
have sailed through the Vamin 
Darma. They would not because of 
the Monster Khedau. There are no 
charts, and if one of the norther 
Harvest squalls such as today‘s blew 
down the fleet would be wrecked.” 

Shevan stamped her foot. “And 
you!” she exploded. “What do the 
Conducs of Port West say? I don’t 
ask for the favors of these supersti- 
tious barren-landers! What will the 
South Shore people of Port West 
say— Varso ’s people-if I ask them to 
carry Great Karel across the Vamin 
Darma in a day?” 

Varso was silent. Del could ima- 
gine behind those dark, sleepless eyes 
the memory of a sailor’s agony, 
unable to turn back within earshot of 
drowning men. At last he said, “We 
must repair the storm damage. To- 
morrow when we see the dawn sky 
we shall be better able to decide. My 



men are weary. They have lost com- 
panions today and are dispirited. 
How can I ask them to answer 
tonight?” 

“He’s right, Shev. Let them-” 

“Shut up, Del.” The girl shook off 
his restraining hand impatiently. She 
breathed deeply and considered. 

“Very well, Varso. But under- 
stand— we leave at first light to- 
morrow unless the weather’s against 
us. See that the refitting is well done. 
If your men work well you may 
breach the cargo of sanpardan we 
took from the submets and brought 
with us. But it is to be strictly 
controlled. The work first— the san- 
pardan as reward.” 

“As my Lady commands.” 

The conducs of the flotilla worked 
on their boats. Squads of colonists 
helped them. 

Four boats had to be raised from 
the water to repair hull damage 
incurred below the waterline. When 
the light drained away behind the 
dead hills and the elder sun came 
out, fire-ore lamps were hung in 
festoons. 

Shevan, Delbet, Zedward, Apian 
and some of the other Thetan leaders 
of the expedition spent the night 
inland in the caravan of the Anselm 
chief. But the Anselm Conducs were 
wary of the Helangles. They gave 
them a place outside the sandhill 
ridge above the caravan circle. 

Only seventeen of those who had 
set out from Port West remained 
beneath the command of Starhowl. 
They quickly pitched their tents, 



INHERITANCE 



135 




forgetting the terrors of the day’s 
journey and the loss of their com- 
rades in the thrusting and crowing 
evoked by their women. 

S HEVAN stood at a window, 
staring uneasily at the distant 
harbor. The noise of the work going 
on there blew in from the sea. 

“They are mending their boats,” 
she said, “but they were afraid and 
they are still afraid. The The tans’ 
world has shrunk so. They fear to 
go beyond a very tight horizon. 
Varso hasn’t forgiven my harshness 
this morning when I wouldn’t let him 
turn back for survivors. I can’t trust 
him to carry his men across the Place 
of Rocks.” 

“Sometimes I envy the Helangles.” 
Zedward was wrapped in the gray 
cloak he had drawn up to protect his 
head from the chill evening. He 
peered through the inland window of 
the caravan toward the ridge. “Per- 
haps we of the Decline would have 
been happier if we had greater sen- 
sual appetites and a more limited 
intelligence as do they.” 

Delbet’s forehead wrinkled in a 
frown. Homan the young Caxitine 
Conduc roared with laughter. “I 
think my broader Caxitine intelli- 
gence helps to deepen my apprecia- 
tion of sensuality. What do you 
say, Delbet Sir?” 

The giant shook his head. He 
cracked his bony fingers. He felt hot 
and ashamed. Apian, Homan’s father, 
frowned at his son. 

“Love—” mused Zedward. 



“Love-that’s what the Superom 
taught us—” 

Delbet rubbed his jaw. 

Love. Love was the warm, silver 
beauty of the talue pulsing in the 
hand, surrendering its crystal treasure 
of fire-ore. Love was the silent 
beauty of the machinery striking up, 
down, back and forth, glistening with 
oil. 

Shevan shook her head. “I ,can’t 
trust them. We must keep a watch.” 
“Maybe it was not wise to 
promise to let them breach the san- 
pardan,” said Homan. “It makes us 
argumentative and the Saivainte very 
pompous. The Agorans just go to 
sleep. But the Helangles get spiteful.” 
Zedward looked at the girl. Slowly 
she and her cousin were becoming 
less remote and godlike, especially to 
Thetans of their own age such as 
Homan. Their decisions could be 
discussed— not challenged yet, but 
discussed. They were less exalted, 
more of the people. He sensed 
Homan felt that by the way the 
young Thetan spoke. 

Shevan shook her head. “No. I 
said they might breach the sanpardan 
as reward. I won’t go back on it. Del, 
you must keep watch on them— you 
and Homan. He’ll go with you. 

“Make sure that Varso explains 
correctly to his crews. Be sure you 
convince him if he wavers that we, 
the Superom, have the power and 
that we fear no monsters. And keep 
the Helangles away from the san- 
pardan. 

“Varso should speak to the sailors 



136 



IF 




before the casks are breached. Old 
Shasem mustn’t blind them with 
honors of this Khedau when their 
wits are dulled. Homan, you must 
translate if Delbet requires it.” 

The two young men got up to go. 
The giant gave his cousin a wounded 
ook but Homan seemed content. 

Zedward, gray beard drooping on- 
to his thin chest inside the cloak, 
hooded his eyes. It would have been 
better to have chosen Apian, he 
thought. He looked at the girl. He 
was an old The tan. He licked his lips, 
but did not question. 

The young men had gone now. It 
was too late. 

XII 

I T WAS still dark when Delbet 
opened his eyes. Before he rea- 
lized that the scythe of pain swinging 
back and forth behind them be- 
longed exclusively to him he saw but 
failed to recognize the blind disk of 
the old sun. Far overhead in the 
pre-dawn sky it peered down through 
the swinging bars of pain like an 
incredibly old jailor staring down 
into a cosmic oubliette. 

Then the pain made him groan, a 
groan with long cords reaching back 
to his stomach. He fought through 
torture to his hands and knees and 
there, four-legged, he was sick and 
then again and again and again until 
his stomach was a knot of cramp. 
And when the dry retching was 
finished he heard the sound of mock- 
ing laughter above his own noise and 



saw that the darkness held more than 
the old sun’s face. 

Through the water in his eyes and 
the pain behind them he saw legs and 
feet which could only be- the with- 
ered limbs of a group of Helangles. 
Among them was a single pair of 
feet, one sandaled, the other bare. 
Raising his head between the blows 
of the scythe the giant saw that the 
feet were Homan’s and that Homan 
was upright only because he was 
supported between the Helangles 
Kickstart and Cleavewind. 

The young Caxitine was alive and 
groaning as Delbet had groaned, but 
the giant was swamped by a new 
wave of nausea when he realized that 
Homan’s wide-open eyes saw nothing 
except eternal night. ' 

And after the giant tried to vomit 
again and couldn’t he wished that he 
himself might be at least temporarily 
blind— for he was forced to look at 
the terrible face of his cousin Shevan. 

‘They have gone!” she stormed.^ 
“They saw a raw landsman and a 
simple giant! They fooled them with 
‘friendship.’ They poured the juice 
of a plant into them and made them 
dummies. And when the dummies 
closed their eyes and snored like 
kiltawi in the longnight they sailed 
away! Varso took his men and his 
ships and we’re left here with these 
superstitious primitives of Anselm!” 

Delbet was kneeling before her. 
“Forgive me, Shev. I think I’m dying. 
Please forgive me.” 

He recalled now trying to be wary. 
He remembered the way the prized 



INHERITANCE 



137 




liquor of the Submets had foamed 
from each cask as the sailor Conducs 
had breached the sanpardan. He had 
held back; but Homan’s shouts of 
laughter as he joined in the celebra- 
tion, and the merry bearded faces of 
the Conducs crowding about him, 
and the hands slapping his back and 
urging him to honor the party under 
the stars, and the swinging fire-ore 
lamps-these had overcome him. 

The Conducs had roared with 
laughter as he had choked and 
sneezed, potent brew jumping down 
his throat and fizzing up his nose. He 
had drunk again and again to prove 
his manhood. Before long the stars 
had begun to collide and the harbor 
and newly repaired boats had 
swarmed with bearded sea-smelling 
friends dancing and fighting and de- 
liriously daring to embrace this 
Superom, to put their bearded lips to 
his ear and tell him rambling stories 
he did not understand. And after 
that there had been only the dark— 
the dark through which the pain 
struck at him again and again and 
again. 

“Forgive me.” 

But Shevan was furious with him 
now and she struck him with the 
blind, wounding rage of a child as he 
knelt before her. When she exhausted 
herself and her fists fell to her sides 
and the only rage remaining flowed 
in tears from her eyes, old Zedward, 
the scholar Thetan, and Apian, the 
father of the blind Homan, led her 
gently away. 

She sat\ on a hewn rib of timber 



and stared out over the bay. The 
ships of the Port West Conducs were 
long gone. There was not even the 
sound of their engines, only the 
empty sounds of water and sky— the 
new day coming up with the shrink- 
ing sun. 

She looked defeated. The power 
of obedience she commanded had 
begun inexorably to slip from her as 
the expedition journeyed farther and 
farther from Spadrox. The fear of 
Superom power was giving way to 
the potency of more immediate gods. 

“We shall have to take some of the 
Anselm ships. We must cross to the 
Graystones before Harvest-end.” She 
spoke as though to herself, though 
Delbet followed her humbly across 
the beach. Behind him trailed the 
three tribal leaders, Zedward, Apian 
and, scuttling painfully, the Helangle 
called Starhowl. 

“I say go around,” said StarhowL 
“Don’t dig this lousy water. Makes 
storms, makes rust. Shags up the 
cruze cells. I had a mindmap of this 
once. I say around only takes two, 
three days and it’s safer. Besides we 
would need crewmen and those An- 
selm jerks won’t go past this Khedau 
thing.” 

“No,” said Shevan. “I can save 
two days by crossing. Besides, I think 
this monster is only a figment of 
someone’s imagination.” 

“The Anselm people won’t go,” 
said Apian. “They would rather die 
here. They’re really scared of Khe- 
dau, whatever it is.” 

“And you?” Shevan turned to the 



1 ^ 



IF 




Conduc leader so abruptly that her 
cousin jumped in surprise^ 

The three chiefs stopped in their 
tracks. 

S HE faced them, a soft sea breeze 
stirring her hair, proud head and 
shoulders etched onto the disk of the 
rising sun behind her. 

Apian cleared his throat. “I-” he 
started. “We—that is— the Caxitine 
Conducs are not really sailors, but I 
think we do not fear without reason. 
I would be prepared to explore—” 
“Zedward?” 

“I have been thinking,” said the 
old Saivainte. “Trying to pick out of 
all my memories of all the books I 
have read what this creature could 
be. I’m sure the Superom eliminated 
all the primitive sea-beasts of old 
Thetis.” 

“But will you come with me? Will 
the Saivainte come and risk this 
Vamin Darma?” 

The old man raised his bony shoul- 
ders in a shrug of resignation. “Those 
of my tribe are scholars and teachers. 
We have always been close to the 
Superom. If you command—” 

“It ain’t one of the old monsters,” 
said Starhowl. He fidgeted from one 
hand to the other, a mannerism 
common to all Helangles divorced 
from their steedes. He pummeled his 
wrinkled strip of forehead with his 
free fist. “Jerksville— that mindmap’s 
really beat up. Hell! It’s got giant 
eyes— real big-like this—” he whirled 
his arm in an impossible circle 



“—bright— big eyes. And a cry like a 
hit tree tiger.” He thought awhile. 
“That’s all I can caU up.” 

“I see that the noises from your 
tents aren’t always hovAs of lust. 
Sometimes you have nightmares, 
too,” said Shevan. “Your people are 
mean and tough. They fight. Will 
they come?” 

Starhowl looked abashed. “Sure! 
Hell! If not. I’ll beat the hell out of 
every one. Like, okay, so I’d rather 
have the land. But— heU, I wasn’t 
stalling I remember. We gotta get 
Great KareLto Mandanar.” He licked 
his lips. 

The girl nodded. “Cousin?” She 
was still cold to the giant. She would 
not use his name. 

“You know I’ll go wherever you 
want, Shev,” he said humbly. 

She turned and began to pace 
forward again. “Good. We’ll take two 
boats— only two. It’s foolish to risk 
many lives. Those we don’t need or 
who are afraid to come with us can 
return overland or any other way to 
the other side of the water and their 
homes.” 

“Shasem?” Zedward queried. 
“The old man? Will he release the 
boats? Will you be able to find 
crews? Where have the Anselm Con- 
ducs gone? I have seen none since the 
Port West people fled. Perhaps 
they’re hiding in the hills?” 

“No,” said Shevan. “They’re here, 
lying low in their autos. Maybe they 
think we’ll go away by road. But I’m 
going to cross the West Water. And 
I’ll take Shasem with me. If I take 



INHERITANCE 



139 




him as hostage his sons will come. 
They’ll handle the boats. And we can 
prove to them that this monster 
threatens nothing but their stu- 
pidity.” 

“That’s if we survive, of course,” 
said Apian softly to his two com- 
panions. 

Fortunately for him the breeze 
blew his words away from Shevan. 
She pressed forward in command 
again, gaining confidence with every 
step. 

The Anselm people had only two 
boats with cruze engines and Shevan 
commandeered them both. She was 
in no mood to listen to any contrary 
pleas. She let the unlucky colonists 
know she held them equally to blame 
for the departure of their kinsmen to 
Port West. 

She organized a ruthless Helangle 
foray into the nearby stone jungle to 
fetch Shasem, who had slipped away 
from the camp to what he thought 
was ' a place of safety. The dwarf 
riders, relishing their new role as 
Superom shocktroops, brought the 
old man back tied to a litter. Shevan 
had him taken straight to a boat and 
then had his sons Edvart and Stanlyn 
rounded up. 

By the time the two boats were 
provisioned, the passengers selected 
and Conduc crews press-ganged, it 
was afternoon again. Due to yester- 
day’s storms and the defection of 
Varso’s flotilla the expedition had 
lost one more precious day. 

It was a grim departure. The An- 
selm sailors were tenified. The many 



Thetans who had traveled this far 
with the expedition only to be left 
behind watched from the crowded 
shore as the two boats floated out 
into the bay. Apian was among these 
silent spectators: Shevan had released 
him to care for his blinded son. 

The bleak hills crouching around 
the bay and the corpse of the old 
stone jungle decaying below listened 
to the beat of the stern engines as the 
boats moved toward open water. 
The mournful wails of the Anselm 
people could be heard from the 
shore. They were convinced the 
crews the Superom had forced into 
the boats were going to their deaths. 

Shevan did not look back— she had 
been forced to abandon many faith- 
ful Thetans. Now she had neither 
Agorans nor their nervous, long- 
necked cadels. Of the Saivainte she 
had brought with her only Zedward. 
She had carefully chosen ten Hel- 
angles, led by Starhowl, and balanced 
them with ten of Aplah’s Caxitine 
Conducs. These, together with the- 
reluctant Anselm Conducs, Delbet, 
herself and the casket were the entire 
complement that sailed into the open 
sea and set course westward again. 

D elbet stood in the prow of 
the leading boat two hours out- 
side the Bay of Anselm. During the 
last half-hour the Anselm Conducs 
had grown increasingly agitated. The 
face of the helmsman had slowly 
changed to the color of sour milk. 
His lips trembled and his hands 
shook on the wheel. 



140 



IF 




From the bow of the lead vessel 
the cry of the lookout was the only 
human sound between sea and sky. 
“Vennel shahah-vennel shahah-” 
The monotonous chant repeated 
every fifteen seconds: “Clear water— 
clear water-” 

Delbet listened, shading his eyes, 
staring into the distance against the 
flashing waves. He was the first to 
hear the chant falter. 

He glanced sharply at the lookout. 
The man’s eyes seemed to have 
grown too big for his skull. The 
tension dragged his head forward; his 
neck sinews were taut cords. His 
short sand-colored beard jutted at 
the horizon. 

The impression lasted only an in- 
stant, but to Delbet the man looked 
as though on the point of having a 
fit. Then compulsive training asserted 
itself. “Vennel shahah—” he wailed. 
“Vennel shahah— ap caildor Vamin 
Darma!” 

A chorus of groans and shrieks 
greeted the sighting. 

Delbet peered ahead. 

Even had he not caught the last 
two words the ripple of fear that ran 
through the Anselm sailors would 
have translated the call. The quality 
of the horizon had changed. The 
unbroken line of water was fuzzy 
with light. 

The giant felt a cold hand in the 
pit of his stomach. Something of the 
fear of the Anselm Conducs seized 
him. He swallowed, shading his eyes 
again, staring ahead. 

The lookout repeated in a choked 



voice, “Ap candor Vamin Darma! Ap 
candor-ap candor-” Slowly the 
man shrank into hiding in the look- 
out post. 

Delbet realized his cousin had 
Joined him. She said nothing. He saw 
her face pucker in a scowl as she 
stared ahead with him into the sun. 
Her mouth, usually full and mobile, 
tightened into a hard line. 

“Dead ahead, Shev.” 

She nodded. “I see it.” 

The giant kept his eyes shaded. It 
was something for his hands to do to 
avoid their betraying his racing dis- 
quiet. 

“Looks pretty much like an atoll 
or reef or something,” he offered 
diffidently. “Don’t see much there 
like a monster to get scared of.” 

Shevan gave him no comfort. 
“Wait. We aren’t close enough yet. 
Right now we’d better get back 
down into the boat. The Anselmites 
are on the point of diving over- 
board.” 

They were. The Vamin Darma was 
becoming clearer every minute. Al- 
ready most of them were nearer to it 
than they had ever expected to be. 
They could see it from ‘the main 
decks now. The horizon’s fuzziness 
was caused by light on breaking 
spray. The area must lie amid cross- 
currents, the giant thought. There 
was little wind to whip the water 
into such waves. 

Several of the Anselm people had 
fallen flat on the decks from fright. 
All the Anselmites were ineffective 
now. Even terror of Shevan and of 



INHERITANCE 



141 




her Superom intelligence could not 
outwei^ the terror of tribal legend. 
And their tenor communicated itself 
to the Caxitine Conducs, who looked 
gray and anxious and muttered to 
one another. Even the Helangles, 
largely insulated from fear or fore- 
boding by their blunt senses and 
their belligerence, could not entirely 
escape the strangeness of the mo- 
ment. A few of them clung to bul- 
warks with their wrinkled hands, 
staring at the approaching unknown 
and jibbering at one another in their 
short colorful phrases. The fear had 
^re^d as well to the second vessel, 
where Shevan had left Zedward the 
Saivainte and Starhowl in command. 

Both boats moved inexorably for- 
ward. 

When she was sure the vessels 
would sail on without the help of the 
sailor Conducs, Shevan hurried for- 
ward again. She no sooner got to the 
bow decks than the luckless look- 
out was finally galvanized out of his 
rigid terror. With a shriek he 
launched himself from the cockpit 
into the water. 

One of the more alert Helangles 
tried unsuccessfully to grab him as 
his head bobbed past in the boat’s 
wash. The terrified sailor swam 
astern. Although he was heading for 
certain death in that huge expanse of 
water he did not cry out again or try 
to rejoin the boats. Transfixed by his 
honor of the Place of Rocks ahead, 
his only thought was to put as much 
distance as he could between it and 
himself. 



Other Anselm Conducs tried to 
follow his example. None got away 
from Shevan’s boat, but before the 
Caxitines and Helangles on the 
second vessel could secure them 
several sailors tried to leap over- 
board. Those who succeeded 
followed their comrade, swimming 
strongly as though the shores of the 
Bay of Anselm were still in sight, to a 
common end. Those left aboard 
wailed and groaned in misery. 

Edvart and Stanlyn, Shasem’s 
sons, rushed along the deck. Al- 
though they were both full-grown 
men they flung themselves on their 
father, howling like distraught in- 
fants. 

The reason for the Anselmites’ 
new frenzy was soon apparent to 
Delbet. He raced along the deck and 
joined Shevan in the prow just be- 
hind the lookout’s empty cockpit. 

The Vamin Darma got closer. It 
was spreading over the entire western 
horizon. The breaking water and 
light-drenched spray no longer hid 
the shoulders and crags of innum- 
erable small islands, fissured and 
pitted by long erosion. From the 
turbulence of the water it was clear 
that from every island visible ex- 
tended dangerous reefs perilously 
close to the surface. 

But it was not the menace of this 
alone that made the West Water 
sailors howl. A terrifying shape 
threaded through the spray and ,the 
leaning crags, looking for all the 
world as though it had been alerted 
by the vessels’ approach.

IF 




“The Conducs’ monster! The Khe- 
dau!” shouted Delbet. 



T he giant felt Shevan’s hand 
grope for his in alarm. When she 
found it she gripped him convulsively 
and her touch was ice. 

The approaching form, cylindrical 
but tapered slightly toward its apex, 
was taller than the tallest crags. It 
was still nearly two kilometers dis- 
tant when, just below its top, a great 
saucer-shaped eye of light opened. 

It seemed to wink at them, then 
swiveled away. A moment later a 
second lens was brought to bear on 
the boats and held them in a longer 
blinding glare before it closed again. 

The boats were still heading di- 
rectly for the looming figure when 
the first turbulence in the water hit 
them. They began to pitch and roll. 

The Khedau wove through the 
hazards of the Vamin Darma with 
practiced skill. It swung unerringly 
past rocks and crags, sometimes 
swaying in some furious disturbance 
but always righting itself. Its eyes 
glared from one boat to the other. 
Free of the main skirt of rocks and 
moving northward along their face, 
from somewhere inside the Khedau 
came a long, hostile roar. 

The howls of fear were no longer 
confined to the Anselmites. Caxitines 
and Helangles joined them. 

Holding convulsively to Delbet on 
one side and the Bulwark on the 
other Shevan shouted over her shoul- 
der, “Starboard ninety! We’ll run 



head-on into it if we go any further.” 

Whether or not he heard all she 
said through the din the Caxitine 
steersman recognized the danger and 
flung himself against the crude tiller. 
The rudder turned and so, more 
slowly, did the boat, yawing and 
groaning. 

There was a collective shout from 
behind them. A wave had broken 
over Zedward’s boat. It staggered 
about uncertainly. In terror of the 
roaring monster on their port beam 
and of the water pouring around 
their feet, the crew fought one an- 
other to bail or to find a place of 
safety. 

“\^at is it? What is it, Shev?” 

She stared at him briefly. Then her 
eyes flickered back to the swaying, 
glaring beast and its fearful home. 

“No wonder they were scared.” 

“We’ll never get past it. It’s ten 
times faster than we are. Hell. We 
ought to turn back.” 

“No,” she said. “Look— watch it 
carefully—” 

The two young cousins clung to 
each other and to the boat’s side as it 
lurched through the heaving sea. 
Through the mist of spray they 
stared at the tall guardian of the 
Vamin Darma. 

It was still moving parallel with 
them to northward, skirting the sea- 
ward fringe of the rocks, gliding 
between crags and outcroppings, un- 
dulating through the surf, glaring and 
roaring. 

“You know, Del-it isn’t-it 
isn’t-” 



INHERITANCE 



143 




A long shout from the second boat 
interrupted her. Zedward the old 
Saivainte stood in the prow waving 
his arms, hailing, gaunt. 

“What is it? What’s he saying, 
Shev?” 

“What I was just going to say, I 
think. Zedward’s a bookman too. I 
think he’s seen it. Just as I’ve seen 
it.” 

With both arms she signaled Zed- 
ward to bring his boat closer. 

Delbet caught a word or two as 
the gale tore up the old man’s 
shouts and scattered them down- 
wind. The giant turned back to stare 
at the towering Khedau that opened 
an eye then closed it again in a 
gigantic wink. The Khedau and the 
boats continued on parallel courses 
across the north face of the Vamin 
Darma. The monster gave no threat 
of attack. Its cries seemed somehow 
admonitory rather than threatening. 

Suddenly Shevan was laughing, 
helplessly lau^ng. It had the mad, 
solemn illogic of a nightmare: the 
tossing boats, the stalking monster, 
the clashing water and grinding teeth 
of the Vamin Darma. 

Zedward’s boat drew alongside. 
Its volunteer helmsmen were a 
couple of Helangles. They coaxed 
and shoved and cursed the engine but 
were -careful that Shevan’s boat re- 
mained between them and the Khe- 
dau. 

Zedward held the rail. He was 
shouting against the noise of the 
water and the boats and the monster 
in the surf. 



Shevan put her hand to her 
mouth. Her eyes ran with tears of 
relief. She moved toward the rail 
to be nearer to Zedward. 

“The Khedau!” he shouted. ‘Khe- 
dau! There is a word like it in some 
of the old hill dialects of the remote 
Conducs.” 

“I know what it is, Zedward,” the 
girl shouted , through another bout of 
laughter. “Don’t you?” 

“The word had the dual meaning 
‘guide’ as well as ‘guardian.’ ” 

“Not the word. I don’t need the 
bloody etymology lesson. Do you 
know what the Khedau is?” 

Delbet glanced confusedly from 
one to the other and then at the 
prowling, glaring monster a few hun- 
dred meters away. It changed course 
and moved westward again. It 
opened a wide eye of light and glared 
back thoughtfully at the boats— 
beckoning? inviting? 

Zedward cupped one hand to his 
mouth. “Not a monster— made— your 
people— Superom— set down at sea- 
in the dangerous sea places—” 

Shevan’s head nodded vigorously. 
“That’s it. It’s mechanical. That’s 
exactly it. One of those beautiful, 
everlasting things my people made. 
And it has gpne on working because 
it doesn’t know how to stop.” 

The giant shook his head in disbe- 
lief but Shevan continued. 

“Every time a boat comes near it 
sweeps out to warn it of danger and 
guide it to the clear channels through 
the rocks. When the Superom left the 
Conducs lost their history, and in 



144 



IF 




their minds the Khedau degenerated 
into an o^re ready to devour them. A 
monster in a monstrous place. Some- 
thing to be feared. But it’s just 
another of your beloved bloody ma- 
chines, Del! It’s a guideship! We have 
only to follow it and it will take us 
across the Vamin Darma.” 

XIII 

Y 'ES, she was right. Shevan was 
right. As she was almost always 
right. 

Within two hours the remnant of 
the expedition crossed the Place of 
Rocks with its frightful crags, drift- 
ing spray and clutching currents. The 
slender Khedau was left to resume 
the patrol that hardly a boat had 
disturbed for six centuries. 

By moonfall of the next morning 
the glaring, shouting mobile watch- 
tower dropped below the steep curve 
of the Thetan horizon and out of 
sight. By moonset the boats rolled 
through the gentle surf of a beach. 
The expedition had finally crossed 
the West Water. 

From Shevan to the most fright- 
ened Anselmite deckhand, everyone 
was utterly exhausted. As soon as the 
boats were beached, however, all 
helped carry the casket ashore. Then 
they found a place in the dunes 
beyond the beach and slept. 

When morning arrived, Delbet, on 
top of a dune, stared out to sea. The 
shrinking sun was already high in the 
^y. IT ^emed to shrivel visibly each 
day. Del believed it, too— he had 



become convinced of the truth be- 
hind Shevan’s mission. 

Northward, the two Anselmite 
vessels were small on the surface of 
the West Water. In spife of Shevan’s 
demonstration that the Khedau was a 
friend rather than an enemy the 
sailors’ primitivism had quickly re- 
asserted itself. No sooner had they 
put out to sea than Shasem gave the 
order for them to bear north. The six 
hundred years of night were still 
more potent than an afternoon of a 
girl’s determination. The Vamin 
Darma remained a forbidden area. 
The Khedau was a monster they 
dare not provoke. 

This surly reversion to superstition 
was like the closing of a door. What 
was left of the expedition was finally 
cut off from those areas which had 
maintained some link with the The- 
tan past through the enclave at Spad- 
rox. The remaining travelers found 
themselves in totally strange coun- 
try-country that had never had any 
existence for them other than on 
maps or in memory. 

The lip of this side of the West 
Water was* the lower end of the curve 
of a vast geographical bowl, once the 
crater of a colossal volcano. Remote 
in the distance, a chain of mountains 
marked the rim of the plateau. The 
tundra stretching out shadowless on 
all sides was gray: the gray of infer- 
tile volcanic shale that gave the Gray- 
stones its name. Here and there rifts 
and cairns of rock relieved the flat 
landscape, but apart from some 
sweeps of moss as gray as the stone

to which it clung there was no sign of 
plant or animal life in the whole 
immense saucer. 

The cart that had carried Karel’s 
casket from Spadrox had been left 
behind at Port West. The light fishing 
vessels of the Water Conducs had not 
been able to cope with it. The 
expedition now had to rely on a 
much cruder vehicle hastily knocked 
together by the Caxitine Conducs 
and towed by two Helangle steedes. 

The column was wholly dependent 
upon the dwarf scouts for mobility. 
None of the Conduc autos had been 
able to cross the West Water. The 
only choice left was to take turns 
walking when there was no room on 
the improvised vehicle. 

The expedition moved out of the 
small fertile area bordering the mud 
and sand flats of the inland sea and 
set out across the desert toward the 
ragged range of mountains to the 
west. The sun stood directly over- 
head. Even at noon it seemed drained 
of all fire in these last days of 
Harvest. 

Shevan urged the expedition for- 
ward, allowing very little time for 
rest or food. She chilled them with 
threats of what could happen if the 
longnight came early, bringing the 
cold and winds down across the 
tundra from the north. 

The coming of evening found 
them still on the plain, many kilo- 
meters from the seashore. When the 
sun set and allowed the ancient ghost 
sun of Thetis to tremble in the sky. 
She van’s apprehensions found a cool 



endorsement. The temperature 
dropped rapidly. 

The expedition made camp. The 
Helangles were sent to gather up 
what fuel they could find for fires. 
Later, in that camp deep on the 
Graystones, Superom, Conducs, Sai- 
vainte and Helangles lay on a 
common ground warmed by 
common fires and ringed by the 
steedes arranged with the cart into a 
protective outer wall. 

Not since before the departure of 
the Superom— perhaps never— had 
representatives of so many of the 
Thetan races made a common camp. 
Karel’s casket lay at its center. As the 
firelight died the casket’s faint emer- 
ald glow intensified. It threw a little 
of its frosty, sea-floor light across the 
forms of thei sleepers. 

Not only did the Helangles provide 
the only means of transport, they 
had the only means of shelter. More 
accustomed to nomadic life, they 
lay by their steedes, grunting and 
twitching and snoring in the open 
while their less hardy companions 
made what comfort they could of 
the Helangle tents. 

Few people other than the dwarfs 
slept well. 

T oward dawn Delbet woke. For 
the tenth or twelfth time that 
night the freezing breath of the 
plateau had numbed him out of 
sleep. 

TTie fires were out, mounds of 
gray ash, Here and there curled a 
wisp of smoke. It was still a long way

IF 




from light; the old ghost sun was 
slipping below the horizon and the 
Superom sun had not yet risen. 
Delbet lay watching his breath con- 
densing against the sag of the hairy 
tent, barely large enough to contain 
his giant frame. The cold had stolen 
into his legs and shoulders. He would 
have liked to return to sleep but 
could not. 

Something moved against the cone 
of light at the tent flap. The giant 
flexed, immediately wide awake, but 
before he could sit up or reach for 
his slingbow he recognized the faint 
girl-scent of his cousin. 

“Shev?” he whispered uncertainly. 

She crawled in beside him. “I’m 
frozen. I’ve been— I’ve been awake. 
This bloody place scares-” 

“Aw hell, baby. Why didn’t you 
come wake me before?” 

The slightest chink in her armor, 
the smallest hint that she could slip 
back to the unquestioning trust in 
him and dependence on his strength 
she had felt as a child, never failed to 
melt his heart. 

Her body was taut as a drawn 
slingbo^y. Her teeth chattered. He 
put out his arms and cuddled her to 
him. He stroked her hair. She began 
to relax but she kept shaking. Her 
hair reminded him of the beautiful 
waterfall-colored coats of the talue. 
Her neck and shoulders felt damp 
beneath his gentle hand. 

Shevan kept her ice-cold fists 
clenched in front of her. The giant 
felt them pressed like arctic rock 
against his belly. 



“I feel like I’ve been awake for 
hours,” she whispered. “I was scared 
the cold might do something to the 
survival systems of the casket. I got 
up to have a look at it. Del— some- 
thing happened. Something out there 
on the Gray stones.” 

“Huh? What do you mean?” Del 
twisted his head trying to look down 
at her but her face was too close up 
against his chest. “What happened?” 

A convulsive shiver racked her 
from head to toe. 

“The old sun was just dipping 
down to the horizon as I came away 
from the casket. I thought I heard 
something. Or maybe I didn’t. Maybe 
I just felt— intuited it. Some trailing 
end of a dream or one of the scouts 
moving. They talk a lot. They dream 
a lot. This cold- 

“Anyhow, I was by the cart. I 
looked out underneath it, between 
the wheels. For a moment there was 
nothing. Then, suddenly, there was 
something- 

“ Across the old sun. Kind of 
thrown into relief, silhouetted. 
Something.” 

“Uh-huh. What sort of some- 
thing?” The giant kept stroking her 
hair. “What sort of thing, Shewy? 
Man? Animal? What?” 

“I don’t know. I— it was so quick. 
A shadow, falling across the bar of 
light.” 

“Dreamed it,” he said, “You 
dreamed it.” 

“No. No, I didn’t dream it.” She 
moved and he realized that the whole 
fly -front of her suit was gaping open. 



INHERITANCE 



147 




“HeU!” he said. “You dumb little 
cub, you! No wonder you’re cold. 
You got damn near nothing on.” 

Her little fists divided and she slid 
her arms around him. She lay tremb- 
ling. “Del-oh, my dear-” 

The giant moved uneasily. She 
changed so fast. He never knew what 
to expect. She’d be strong and pas- 
sionate, determined, for days, even 
weeks on end, bullying anyone who 
opposed her, scaring the brutish Hel- 
anges, lashing the Conducs with her 
tongue, matching intellects with the 
Saivainte. Then suddenly she’d need 
to come to him, need to be held and 
petted and comforted like a child. 

“Listen,” he said, “it’s nearly sun- 
up. Let’s get out of this torn old 
Helangle blanket and get something 
to eat. I’ll make a sweep around 
camp. See what I can find.” 

“Wait,” she said. “Wait, Del.” 

The giant felt a strange tenseness 
in her body. She was waiting for 
something, too— like the moment be- 
fore diving off a rock for the pool 
below; the instant before triggering 
the slingbow, before the bolt hisses 
through the air. He felt her thighs 
tremble. Every part of her was poised 
to strike or suffer or submit. 

His movement onto one elbow was 
a reflex. -He fled from this mood that 
had transported his cousin. He rolled 
out of his blanket quickly. He tucked 
it around her. Her pale face stared up 
at him from the cocoon. It had a 
remote, ecstatic look. “Stay here. 
Keep warm. I’ll go take a look.” 
“What do you feel for me, Del? 



What is it that you feel for me?” The 
edge to her words and her great, dark 
eyes, so like those of the other 
cousin left behind in Spadrox, re- 
strained him. They held him better 
than her imprisoned hands, forced 
him to bend over her in the gray 
light. 

“You,” he said, “you’re dreaming. 
You’re still dreaming. What do you 
mean, Shev?” 

“No I’m not,” she said. “No. You 
answer me, Del. What do you feel?” 

H e knelt staring with scared 
earnestness into her face. Again 
he did not understand. He shook his 
head. Demands that he put into 
words what it was easier to sense and 
to let be embarrassed him. 

“Well,” he said, “I just want you 
to be happy. I want both of us 
safe and happy. Like it used to be at 
Spadrox when you were little and I 
wasn’t much more than as high as an 
ordinary man. Just— for you and me 
to go on living in sight of each other 
like that-” 

The clumsy words stopped. She 
looked at him with a sustained look 
that searched deeply. Her eyes 
closed. Her lips parted. She touched 
her top lip with her tongue. 

“Go! Go on out, you big child! Go 
catch yourself a bloody talue— ” 
Confusion, fury, tenderness over- 
laid by an unrelenting will to be: His 
cousin seemed to wage a constant 
war against something ^e could not 
control, something forever holding 
her back from that edge of being. 



148 



IF 




These spiky thoughts harrowed the 
giant. He felt he had been punished 
without reason. He did not under- 
stand. He slunk away. The darkness 
accepted him. 

He moved through the camp with 
expert stealth. No one woke. One or 
two of the Helangles stirred and 
muttered. Odd words fumbled 
through a net of dreams, turning and 
writhing in throats. 

Del crossed the perimeter of the 
camp. The land was dark. The sky 
was flat, a pale, uniform fish-belly 
silver. 

He was unarmed but did not feel 
afraid. This was dead land with 
nothing but the fallen images of 
rocks. There were few places where 
anything could hide. 

He spiraled away from the camp in 
concentric sweeps. He acquired a 
new sense in these circumstances and 
intuitively searched for tracks where 
shadows denied his eyes purchase, 
where neither moss nor volcanic rock 
held any scent. 

He found nothing. A hundred 
meters from camp, crouching so his 
giant frame would not be silhouetted 
against the sky, he thought about 
what Shevan had seen or thought she 
had seen. 

He found himself instinctively 
examining each potential lair within 
striking, distance of the camp. There 
was nowhere anything could hide. 
His eyes followed the profile of a 
monolith toward the skyline and 
back down. He looked again, moved 
on, came back to it. The machine in 



his brain would not let him leave the 
massive form. He frowned with the 
effort of fusing his conscious and 
unconscious thoughts. 

He stayed crouching in the silence 
and the slowly developing light. He 
went over the rock contour again and 
again. Then he remembered what 
Shevan had said. And he got it. 
Something silhouetted against the 
ancient sun which was now the moon 
of Thetis’ night. Something sil- 
houetted against the old sun. But 
what Delbet saw was a great band of 
cloud across the horizon. The old sun 
would not have been visible as it set. 
And the mountains themselves would 
have prevented anything appearing in 
silhouette— anything which was not 
mammoth or walking the mountain 
tops. 

The giant listened to the dawn 
rising on the lifeless plain. The hair 
on his neck prickled. He remembered 
the day when the twisted dwarf 
Arcweld had seemed to grow out of' 
the ground in the hillside forest 
above Westward City Three, just be- 
fore the first of the expedition’s 
many troubles had begun. 

He had already started back to- 
ward camp^ when the first cries of 
dismay unwound him to his full 
height and brought him running. 

Smoketrail was missing. The re- 
maining Helangles were scuttling 
around shouting at one another and 
calling for their lost comrade. There 
were few places in the camp where 
he might be. It was soon clear that he 
was gone, vanished off the face of 



INHERITANCE

the night plain as though into its very 
air. 

Someone identified his steede 
stacked among the others in the 
camp’s stockade. Kickstart re- 
membered that Smoketxail had slept 
to his left in the outer circle of 
Helangles, right at the camp’s edge 
farthest from the watchfires. 

Starhowl organized a search party. 
They roared off to circle the area and 
investigate any crevice or outcrop 
that gave the merest hint of shelter. 
Four Caxitines also left the camp on 
foot at sunup to search the im- 
mediate neighborhood. 

Shevan watched their frantic ef- 
forts with dark dispassion. When Del 
came back to camp she was already 
out of the Helangle tent talking to 
Zedward. She looked pale and re- 
mote, as though she had endured 
some major physical crisis. Her eyes 
were huge and hollow in her pale 
face, 

Delbet pretended to busy himself 
with a minute inspection of the outer 
perimeter where the missing Helangle 
scout had slept but the giant was 
within earshot of the girl and the old 
man. 

“—What was it like?” Del heard 
him ask, 

“A shadow,” she said. “The relic 
sun was setting. I looked out be- 
tween the wheels of the cart. Some- 
thing crossed the bar of light. As if 
leaping down to the earth. Arms 
like this— but not really arms—” 
--Del watched her shyly. She raised 
her arms so they formed an acute 



angle with her shoulders. She had 
momentarily acquired the wings of a 
bird. 

“Then it was gone.” 

The image troubled the giant, but 
he could not think why. 

T wenty minutes later the Caxi- 
tine Conducs found Smoketrail. 
He was dead. 

Moving in a circle they .had 
worked their way behind the camp, 
covering the trail the expedition had 
followed just before stopping the 
previous night. 

A little to northward a fault line in 
the rock substrata, split by old earth- 
quakes, formed several connected 
hollows full of tumbled stone. At the 
lowest point of the biggest hollow, 
water had collected from the Harvest 
dews— one of the reasons the expedi- 
tion had made camp nearby. 

One of the more alert Conducs 
noticed that the water was a strange, 
dark color. It was fouled by blood. A 
red trail led to a vertical crevice in 
the adjacent ravine. There, hardly 
concealed at all, was the cold body 
of the Helangle scout. He had died 
instantly from a clean thrust in the 
neck. The weapon had vanished with 
his killer. 

It was a primitive crime and the 
Helangles reacted primitively. They 
first accused the Conducs, but when 
the Conducs violently protested that 
they carried nothing that could have 
inflicted such a wound the dwarf 
scouts turned upon each other. 
Those who were from Smoketrail’s 



150 



IF 




own pack accused the others. The 73 
City South and other packs made an 
uneasy alliance, claiming that Smoke- 
trail’s companions from the West 
Helangles had done away with him 
because he had been ambitious. 

There was no explanation for the 
murdered man’s leaving the camp 
alone at night. No one could guess 
why he should have walked the two 
hundred meters to the ravine. The 
pool seemed the obvious .explana- 
tion, but plenty of water had been 
carried into the camp to last the 
night. 

Although the quarrel among the 
Thetans continued till the sun had 
risen high Shevan did not intervene. 
Time was being lost but she seemed 
to need to stay by the casket and 
talk earnestly to Zed ward. She re- 
fused to go to the ravine. In the end 
the giant and Zedward had to ride 
down with a party of Helangles and 
find a place to bury Smoketrail’s 
remains. ^ 

Everyone was frightened and de- 
pressed by the conjunction of violent 
death with the apparition Shevan had 
seen in the night. When they finally 
set out in moody silence, even the 
sky seemed to conspire against them. 
The sun appeared only occasionally 
from behind great ramparts of cloud 
sweeping down from the north. Huge 
menacing shadows stalked every- 
where across the Graystones as the 
cloud squadrons galloped overhead. 

When the expedition camped that 
night the Helangles, dusty, weary and 
sullen, found fuel to build watchfires. 



Fear sank their ill humor and encour- 
aged them to make a pact with the 
Conducs and among themselves that 
allowed agreement on mounting a 
guard. 

Delbet said he would take his turn 
but had no intention of sleeping at 
all that night. Hour after hour, 
whether on guard or dozing with his 
feet to the fire, his hunter’s senses 
were turned to his cousin’s tent. 

She was a strange child. Since last 
night she had grown still more im- 
penetrable, remote, hardly acknowl- 
edging his existence. All day she had 
said nothing to anyone but Zedward. 
Delbet had seen the old Saivainte 
regarding her with gravity and pity. 

The night passed. Nothing 
happened. The relic sun began to 
wane. It looked down now and then, 
an old invalid peering from between 
scudding clouds. In the morning the 
expedition was intact. 

Slowly they moved on, all that 
day and the next. The Graystones 
did not trouble them with any 
further horrors. The continually 
threatening cold did not descend. 
The shadowy mountains neared. 

“Beyond them and on the table- 
land is the Galactic City of the 
Super om,” said Zedward. “Mandanar 
the impenetrable and secret, where 
Great Karel can be awakened by the 
marvels of his people.” 

It was Zedward’s turn with Delbet 
to ride the cart. The giant stared up 
at the sierra ahead and nodded, 
replying as the cart bumped over the 
plain. 



INHERITANCE 



151 




“And what if it’s dead like the 
other stone jungles? What if Shevan 
misinterpreted a sentence— just a 
single phrase— on the talktapes and 
followed the paths through the 
words the wrong way?” 

“In that case one thing at least is 
clear. We would not be able to 
return to Spadrox. Not without great 
hardship. Those of us who are young 
now would be old and those of us 
who are already old would die on the 
way.” 

Delbet thought bleakly about the 
kind of homecoming they might ex- 
pect at the enclave. But by the time 
they returned, Keren himself might 
be dead and the Thetans might have 
forgotten the existence and purpose 
of the expedition. The Regent’s face 
fastened itself on the giant’s mind 
and would not let go. 

These thoughts were like a premo- 
nition oozing up through cracks in 
Delbet’s consciousness. He tried to 
put them out of his head, but even 
while Zedward was talking, bumping 
alongside him in the cart, the images 
took hold, shutting out the old man’s 
words. 

A few hours later the second 
calamity of the Gray stones struck. 

T he giant was constantly 
aware of the powers at work on 
Thetis: the force of wind and rain; 
the trembling cold of the longnight; 
the senescence of the preterite sun; 
the warmth of the star his own 
people had set alight in the sky. 
Because of his essential simplicity he 



was always conscious of the struggle 
between these and the men who 
clung to existence on the planet. So 
the events of that afternoon and 
evening, as the sun disappeared be- 
hind great banks of cloud and a 
threatening wind rose, could not be 
disentangled from the forewarning of 
the evil foce that had haunted him as 
he rode on the cart. 

Not long after the midday break 
one of the Helangle scouts sighted an 
old Superom road. It crossed the 
Graystones from north to south, near 
the first slopes of the foothills of the 
mountain range. 

Spirits soared. Following Shevan’s 
directions the expedition hurried 
south, searching for a road junction 
to take them through a mountain 
pass and onto the plateau which 
Zedward said lay beyond. 

They found the road after travel- 
ing for two hours, then moved west- 
ward, but stopped in the late after- 
noon at a point where the road 
crossed the foothills before joining 
the pass into the range. A problem 
was upon them. 

Soon they would need cruze to 
replenish the fuel cells on the Hel- 
angle steedes. 

Shevan, Delbet, Starhowl, one of 
the Conducs and Zedward sat to- 
gether under the scowl of cloudbanks 
and the shadow of mountains and 
talked for almost an hour. 

Starhowl was prepared to go on. 
Shevan had not yet completely es- 
caped the trauma of three nights ago, 
and she sensed in the others the 



152 



IF 




apprehension of running out of fuel 
in the mountains. They agreed that 
although several hours of light re- 
mained they would camp there that 
night. 

“Now we’re off that place,” said 
Del, with a jerk of his head to 
indicate the Graystones, “we might 
be able to dig some cruze out of this 
rock.” 

The Conduc looked doubtful. The 
Caxitines were expert miners. 

“We wouldn’t have the equipment 
to get at the purest ore. We might get 
some out of the surface but then it 
would be too crude. We’d need re- 
fining equipment.” 

“One way or another we have to 
get cruze.” Shevan pressed her 
cheek wearily with her left hand. 
“We can’t walk over the mountains 
in the longnight.” ' 

“Maybe we could make it,”* said 
Starhowl. “Like coasting downhill 
and using the motors for up— huh?” 

Shevan said, “We can’t risk it 
On the plateau we’ll probably find 
Conducs who will have supplies. But 
we can’t trust ourselves to go into 
the mountains without having some 
reserve.” 

“Shev, I guess I ought to take a 
party. We’ll move up toward the 
mountains. That’s cruze ground if I 
ever saw any. The Conduc says we 
can’t mine the rich ore. He’s right, 
but we can manage on crude if 
there’s enough of it. If I can get up 
high enough on one of the mountains 
and strike a seam that’s been cut out 
by the weather-” 



“We need you back before night- 
fall. We can’t split the group here, 
right next to the Graystones and at 
night.” 

Zed ward cleared his throat. “I was 
wondering,” he said, “if you could 
find a cave. These mountains and the 
desert were very thinly inhabited. 
Probably the outcrop cruze hasn’t 
been touched-” 

Delbet clapped his thigh with de^ 
light. He would have thumped the 
old man’s shoulder had he not feared 
Zedward might collapse into a sigh 
and a handful of dust. 

“Zedward’s right! If we can find a 
cave— there might be an exposed 
seam.” 

Shevan nodded. “Very well, but 
remember you’ve got to be back 
before dark. Del-” 

She looked at lier cousin with 
another of her enigmatic looks, so 
troubled and troubling. But now he 
was too captured by Zedward’s idea 
to pay much attention to Shevan’s 
moods. 

Within ten minutes a party had 
been selected and was on the move: 
the giant, two Helangles and two 
Conducs. 

The Helangles rigged a litter be- 
tween their steedes for the others to 
ride. With two hours left until sunset 
they roared off along the junction 
highway, climbing steadily for the 
hills. 

Delbet made them break across 
country after about half an hour. 
One of the Conducs had drawn the 
giant’s attention to a red-streaked 



INHERITANCE 



153 




fold in one of the hillsides. Though 
the fold might not indicate the pres- 
ence of ore-bearing rock the face 
itself was split and had formed from 
the second generation intrusion rock 
of Thetis. This rock frequently 
carried ore and was soft enough in 
certain strata to erode into cave 
formations when exposed to weather 
or subterranean water. 

They had to cover the last three 
hundred meters on foot as the 
ground became progressively more 
rock-strewn. 

At last they stood in a saucer- 
shaped clearing looking up at the 
folded rock. One of the Conducs 
walked over and scraped away at one 
of the red streaks with a probe from 
his prospecting kit. 

Del moved in behind him, watch- 
ing the dust fall. As the probe bit 
further, the spurting dust in the tube 
- began to glow feebly. 

“This is it, Delbet Sir. First 
strike.” 

“First strike!” The smiling giant 
looked ready to jump up and down 
with pleasure. 

“It’s weak,” said the second man. 
“Debilitated. Probably wouldn’t even 
kick a cell. Been too near the surface 
for too long.” 

“Yes. Okay. But it is cruze ore. 
There should be a richer source 
nearby.” 

L eaving the Helangles on watch, 
the Conducs and the giant set 
out to search for a cave that would 



reach into the rock far enough to 
touch a worthwhile seam of cruze. 
There were a numben of fissures 
which began promisingly, but they 
quickly petered out. 

The Conducs had begun to climb 
the face when Delbet found a cave. 

He had started moving around the 
hill to see whether the prospects 
looked more promising on the other 
side when he heard a familiar sound. 

The sound itself was a good omen. 
A huge grin of pleasure split the 
giant’s face. The sound was repeated: 
the warning whoop of a talue. A 
second later a flash like a question 
mark written in water curved against 
the rock and then dissolved. 

The giant froze, but the talue had 
seen him. He sprinted, almost as soft 
and elegant as the creature itself, and 
saw the eye-shaped gash in the 
ground into which the talue had 
disappeared. 

To the left of it was another, 
much larger hole. Rock that at- 
tracted talue would carry fire-ore and 
its mineral relation, cruze ore. Al- 
though the two elements acted vol- 
canically if brought into contact they 
existed side by side, dormant, in 
similar strata. 

“Here!” Delbet shouted. 

When the others reached him they 
found him crouched, peering into the 
gloom of a tunnel which shelved 
steeply toward the base of the hill. 

If there were rich deposits of 
cruze-bearing ore anywhere below 
the hill the sloping cave would lead 
the party nearer to them. 



154 



IF 




The Conducs lit their prospector’s 
lamps and lowered them into the 
cave. The light caught the faint glint 
of water. The soft strata of the 
intrusion rock had been worn away 
by some subterranean spring; the 
hard strata had been left to form a 
good shelving chamber. To judge 
from the light the cave was large 
enough for a man to occupy with 
little more discomfort than a stoop. 

Delbet looked at his two pros- 
pecting companions. They both 
nodded. 

The giant called to the two Hel- 
angle scouts. “One of you watch the 
mountains. The other watch the 
highway. If we aren’t out of the cave 
by the time the light starts to go 
from the desert, come down and 
warn us.” 

The dwarfs touched their crash- 
hats in acknowledgment. One of 
them left his bike and started to 
climb the ridge above to get a view of 
the mountains. 



44nn WO OF US wni go in as far as 
X we can. We’ll fasten a line out 
here.” Delbet started to tie a rope to 
a boulder near the cave mouth. “The 
other must stay clear, someplace 
where the tunnel entrance is still 
visible. Be ready to give help or call 
the Helangles if the front men get in 
difficulty. Okay?” 

“Okay, Delbet Sir.” 

“Right. I’ll go.” The giant started 
to lower his bulk into the cave. Three 
minutes later they were all under- 



ground. Delbet paid out the rope as 
they moved through the cave by the 
light of the prospecting lamps. 

After forty meters the cave 
forked. Both forks were too narrow 
to permit Delbet to go far so he 
returned to the junction where he 
could see the entrance as a gash of 
light in the darkness. 

His two companions crawled into 
the fork which they judged to lead 
under the hill. They and their lights 
were soon cut off from Delbet by 
further twists and turns, although he 
could hear them for a long time 
talking to each other and rattling 
loose stones as they pressed forward. 

Ten minutes went by. Fifteen. The 
entrance seemed much farther away 
than forty meters. The two black 
mouths of the forked ways were 
dark, silent. It was cold and solitary 
underground. The water of the lost 
stream whispered occasionally. Now 
and then a random drop of water fell 
from somewhere overhead. 

The giant jumped when the first 
drill started up. It was twenty-five 
minutes since the Conducs had 
entered the tunnels, yet their drills 
sounded so loud they might have 
been only a dozen meters away, just 
around the corner in the darkness. 

The two drills whined together for 
a while. Then they stopped. Then 
one went on alone on a different 
note. 

Delbet, who had spent much time 
devising machinery for the cruze 
mine at Spadrox, recognized the 
change in pitch as the solo drill 



INHERITANCE 



155 




struck into the old hard rock of the 
Thetan substrata. The Conducs were 
ambitious. They were going for a rich 
seam, probably trapped in a layer of 
intrusion rock between two layers of 
hard rock. 

The sound of the prospecting 
lasted twenty minutes. It was 
followed by a long silence. 

The giant strained his ears to catch 
the sound of the two miners re- 
turning. He crawled a little way 
down the secondary tunnel and 
listened. There was no sound. 

He went back to the junction and 
tested the cord. It was tight. Where it 
vanished upward the eye of light at 
the cave entrance was still bright. 
The drilling started again. 

Delbet tried to imagine what was 
happening under the hill. Maybe his 
companions had struck an isolated 
pocket of ore and exhausted it be- 
fore they had sufficient amounts. 
Maybe the rock looked promising 
but had concealed only a bumed-out 
deposit. 

The second round of drilling 
stopped shortly. In the new silence 
the giant waited anxiously. The 
underground cold had begun to 
strike at his bones. He had been in 
the cave more than an hour. He 
looked back and up at the mouth. 
There was not much time left before 
the Helangle guards would come to 
warn him of sunset. 

Delbet yawned and flapped his 
arms in an effort to keep warm. He 
listened then knelt and peered down 
the right fork of the tunnel. The 



Conducs were returning. He could 
hear them. His eyes caught dribbles 
of light from their lamps. At the 
same moment a pebble fell down the 
shaft behind him. 

He strained his neck to look back 
again to the entrance. The thought 
was still in his mind that one of the 
Helangles would appear there soon to 
warn them it was time to start for 
the camp. 

As he looked up something 
twisted across the light, brushed past 
him and fell to the floor of the cave. 
The giant jumped away reflexively 
and in the same instaiit realized that 
what had fallen was the rope they 
had used to let themselves down the 
incline to the cave floor. 

He. was baffled, then angry. The 
rope could not have slipped acci- 
dentally from its anchpr. He stared 
belligerently up the slope to the 
entrance. Maybe one of the Helangles 
had tripped on the cord and tom it 
free. 

There was no one visible up there. 
Delbet crouched on his haunches and 
felt around the floor until he found 
the fallen rope. He sat in the gloom, 
fingering the end of it. There could 
be no doubt about which end had 
come from the surface. The other 
end was still fastened to a spur of 
rock at the cave junction. And the 
surface end had been severed— cut 
through. 

Cut! The giant stared in disbelief 
at the end of cord in his hand. The 
sound of his companions ap- 
proaching along the fork was getting 



156 



IF 




louder. Delbet looked up yet again to 
the entry way. Surely the Helangles 
had not cut the line-what would 
have been their purpose? 

He opened his mouth to shout but 
realized in time that it might panic 
the two Conducs returning with the 
cruze ore. He started to scramble up 
the incline, trailing the rope behind. 

He was less than halfway up when 
the aperture suddenly grew heads as 
though s.ome fertile medium 
sprouting a bacterial growth. Six 
faces appeared simultaneously on all 
sides staring down the hole. They 
were all fiercely bearded. None of 
them was Helangle. 

D elbet was so startled he 
neither moved nor spoke. He did 
not know if they had seen him. It 
was possible they had not, looking 
from light into darkness. 

One of them grunted a short 
comment to another. The giant re- 
cognized a Conduc inflection in the 
speech, but it was in a dialect he had 
never heard. 

Without betraying his position by 
movement he called out in the uni- 
versal tongue. 

“Hey! You there! What the hell 
did you do to my rope?” 

The effect was dramatic. There 
was a split second’s pause, then all 
the heads withdrew as magically as 
they had appeared. 

Delbet felt a chill. He rushed up 
the incline. Rocks showered down as 
he scrambled for the exit. His hands 
were tom, his legs grazed. Below him 



in the pool of darkness at the junc- 
tion he heard some worried bleats 
from the Conduc miners who were 
nearing the end of their tunnel but 
he could not stop to reassure them. 

He was still too far away when like 
a tired old eye the entrance began to 
close. He saw what was happening 
and with an immense effort flung 
himself forward and upward to jam a 
small rock into the closing gap. He 
hoped it would give him a second 
longer to escape the trap. 

The rock held momentarily but 
the force steadily shoving the boul- 
der over the exit was too great. 
Delbefs rock wedge sprang away, 
missing him by a whisper, and 
bounced down the incline, taking a 
minor avalanche with it. 

Only a few minutes before the 
trace rope had been secured to a 
boulder. Now the rope lay at the 
bottom of the first shaft and the 
boulder firmly blocked the cave’s 
entrance. Delbet and the Conducs 
were trapped. 

The giant clung to the rock and 
shouted through one of the re- 
maining open cracks. 

“Listen-you out there. I am 
Superom. I am Delbet Sir from Spad- 
rox. Superom! I order you to move 
this rock and free me. Superom here, 
I tell you! Do you know what the 
punishment is for disobedience to 
the Superom?” 

He listened, panting. The outer- 
world was quiet. Grunting with the 
effort he fought to move the rock 
plug but everything worked against 



INHERITANCE 



157 




him. The cave mouth was almost 
horizontal; the full weight of the 
boulder rested against it. And the 
only footholds were no good. Delbet 
could not get the full power of his 
shoulders under the rock. 

“You!” he shouted again. “Hey— 
you. Answer me! I am Superom. 
Answer me!” 

There was still no response. Then 
after several seconds a voice broke 
the silence. Its owner was obviously 
standing prudently far from the cave, 
probably concealed behind rocks in 
the clearing. He spoke in the uni- 
versal tongue, but haltingly and 
badly. 

“Superom don’t coming out of the 
ground. Superom coming from the 
sky. You are not. We are going for 
get real Superom who returned to us 
from sky. You stay!” 

“Come back!” shouted Delbet. 
“Come back! There are no Superom 
left in Thetis but those in Spadrox— ” 

Then he realized the significance 
of what the mysterious spokesman 
had said. The giant stopped abruptly, 
his mouth already open to shout 
again. He swallowed, leaning against 
the rock and the cave wall. It might 
just have been a translating slip. 
The man had spoken the univer- 
sal tongue very crudely. Like the 
fusing of two channels, the giant’s 
brain related two things: what his 
captors had just said and what She- 
van had seen three nights past. 

“What is it? Delbet Sir-what’s 
happened? Is it night? Why didn’t 
the Helangles call us?” 



Forty meters down the cave, Del- 
bet made out the shapes of the two 
Conduc miners. Now that the en- 
trance was closed the darkness was 
thicker, more oppressive, but he 
could see them. 

“We’re trapped, my friends,” he 
said. “Strange people have sealed us 
in. I don’t know who they are. I 
don’t know what has happened to 
the Helangles. I don’t know what’s 
going to happen to us. But they’ll be 
back and I fear who may be with 
them.” 

XIV 

T he first Conduc said, “It’s dark. 
I’m getting cold.” 

“I’m afraid,” said the second one. 
“What’s going to happen?” 

“What lies beyond the ore face?” 
The giant peered restlessly into the 
yawn of the first fork^ He had no 
comfort or answers for his scared 
companions. 

“The passage goes on, but it gets 
wet and even narrower. I wouldn’t 
like to try it without a proper team 
Behind me. And you couldn’t even 
make it to the face, Delbet Sir.” 
“Don’t worry about me. If there is 
a chance to save yourself, take it. 
And if you can get to the surface you 
might be able to reach camp and 
raise the alarm before the new ones 
get back.” 

“No. We stay with you.” The 
Conducs spoke the same words in a 
single voice. 

Twenty minutes had passed since 
the cave had been sealed. Delbet had_ 
no means of knowing how far the 



158 



IF 




raiders might have to go before they 
could return in force with the 
menace their words had promised. It 
might take an hour or two. Or, if 
they had to go as far as the plateau, 
it might take a day or more. 

It was dark outside. At the foot of 
the incline darkness was almost total. 
Cold had begun to probe their bones. 

They were already overdue at 
camp. She van would be watching the 
fading ribbon of highway and cursing 
him again. Their only hope was that 
one of the two Helangles might have 
escaped and warned the expedition 
of what had happened. 

The two Conduc prospectors at- 
tempted to dislodge a section of the 
boulder by drilling but the huge rock 
was solid pre-intrusion stone. They 
abandoned the attempt when it was 
clear that even if their drills held out 
it would take too long to cut away 
a section large enough to permit 
escape. 

The smaller of them went down 
the left fork to see what chance of 
escape it offered, but the passage 
Tunneled down to less than a meter 
diameter and was half-full of icy 
water. 

They all sat together now, backs 
against the cave wall, staring up into 
the shaft. If they could not find a 
way around the plug they would be 
trapped until their captors returned. 

“Go.” said Delbet. “Both of you. 
It’s your only real chance. Even if 
they come back for me they won’t 
be likely to follow you into the fork. 
And you may find a way through-” 



“No.” They spoke as one. 

Both the Conduc miners were 
thoroughly frightened. Stubbornness 
increased with their fear. All three 
men were listening for any sound 
that would indicate their captors 
were returning. 

“What’s that?” hissed the small 
man. 

“Sss!” Delbet warned. They froze 
into immobility. 

From the extremity of the incline 
came a faint but unmistakable scuffl- 
ing. The giant reached through the 
darkness and roughly gripped an arm 
of each of his companions. Both 
were shaking as if fever-ridden. He 
tightened his hold, willing them to 
silence. 

“Hell’s fire!” The word came out 
on his own breath, but so faintly it 
could have been part of the darkness. 

The scuffling sound approached 
them from the surface down the 
tunnel in short rushes. Suddenly Del- 
bet’s lips parted on a short breathy 
whistle. Both Conducs were incredu- 
lous. To them it sounded as though 
the giant had magically produced a 
talue from the air above their heads. 
There was an immediate answering 
whistle from midway along the in- 
cline. The scuffle had stopped. 

Delbet whistled again and the 
talue that had come into the cave 
flashed forward, dislodging a flurry 
of earth. 

The giant called again, encourag- 
ingly. The little beast made another 
dartiiig rush but then gave a quick 
whoop of warning and fled. 



INHERITANCE 



159 




“Hell! Scented us!” Delbet re- 
laxed. Far above, the talue’s claws 
scrabbled on the rock as it slithered 
from the cave. “But that’s it-there’s 
a chance—” 

“How?” 

“What do you mean, Delbet Sir?” 
“Conjunction,” said the giant. 
“Cruze. Fire -ore. The talue collect 
fire-ore pellets. If we can catch one 
with a fire-ore pebble-” 

“Explosion!” 

“Blow the plug!” 

“That’s it.” 

“But the cruze-it’s not refined.” 
“It won’t matter. We won’t need a 
big explosion. I think the cruze in 
the ore you’ve collected is rich 
enough. You found a good seam.” 
“How are you going to catch the 
talue?” 

The giant’s mind was already 
racing. “I wish I had a slingbow and 
bolts! But it will have to be net and 
noose-” 

“Net?” 

“The line. Start unraveling it. 
There’ll be enough strands in it for 
net and noose both,” 

They switched on, the prospecting 
lamps. They had been conserving 
them for an emergency, but this was 
the emergency. 

F ifteen minutes later they were 
in darkness again at the head of 
the incline. Through the largest re- 
maining crevice between boulder and 
cave' wall they could just glimpse the 
sky and the dark hump of i^adow 
that was the spur of a hiU. 



The Conducs positioned them- 
selves so that the rough net they had 
made was spread to wrap any talue 
Delbet could snare. 

The giant moistened his lips. His 
heart was pounding. He warbled the 
talue call into the night. 

They missed the first two but soon 
developed their technique and co- 
ordination well enough to catch one. 
Four talue later the trapped Thetans 
found the first piece of pouched 
fire-ore. 

Delbet insisted they continue. 
Time was passing, but a single piece 
of ore mi^t be inadequate. Never- 
theless, after they acquired three 
more pieces he was forced to give up. 
The local talue colony was at last 
becoming suspicious. The intervals 
between animals responding to the 
lure were getting longer. 

The prisoners retreated to the foot 
of the incline. Working by the light 
of the lamps, they used three out of 
the four cylinders of ore to make 
three crude bombs. 

As the two elements were brought 
into contact eruption would com- 
mence immediately and within a few 
seconds the chemical reaction would 
produce an explosion. Hence the 
fuses would have to be long. Delbet 
and the two Conducs shredded the 
cord of the line again until they had 
three long threads. Then the two 
Conducs climbed back up the incline 
and placed the three charges close 
together at the top of the crevice 
where there was a surface flat enough 
to hold the nuggets of fire-ore. They 



160 



IF 




wedged the inverted canisters of 
CTUie over the fiitore fuses. They 
had cut thin metal wafers from their 
prospecting kits to separate fuse and 
charge. When the threads were pulled 
the disks would be drawn clear. The 
cruze would fall into contact with 
the fire-ore. 

Delbet’s thread broke as he pulled 
it; due to his anxiety he had jerked it 
too hard. But the Conducs were 
more expert. Orange .fire, molten and 
potent, dripped from two places 
overhead, lighting the darkness. 

The volcanic power from these set 
off the third bomb. 

The three men scrambled for 
safety. Crouched in the right fork 
passage out of the direct path of the 
blast they saw the light change 
quickly to red, to white. A small 
eruption followed by a big one sent 
stones and earth spraying down the 
tuimel. 

Delbet and the other two scramb- 
led up over the warm rubble. Through 
acrid dust and fumes they could see 
that their makeshift bombs had 
blown a great gash in the cave wall. 
The imprisoning plug had partly 
fallen into the hole but more than 
enough room was left to set them 
free. 

They ran. Near the entrance to the 
first dip they found the remains of 
the Helangle steedes. They had been 
painstakingly smashed, the wheels 
tom and buckled. There was no sign 
of the dwarf scouts. 

Much of the night had passed. The 
sky was clouded but already slate 



gray light on the eastern horizon 
announced sunrise. 

“This way.” Delbet led them up a 
ridge, due east toward the camp. “If 
their fires haven’t gone out we 
should be able to see them from the 
top.” 

The giant stood amid rock and 
shrub at the summit and stared east- 
ward. Far away, like a great lens, the 
invisible West Water focused the gray 
pre-dawn light against the clouds. 
But on the humped back of the 
Graystones desert between the hori- 
zon and the foothills, the last of the 
night settled like a black bird. 

The giant sank to his haunches. He 
ran his tongue over his lips, still 
dusty from the explosion. The Con- 
ducs joined him. 

“Where? Where are they?” 

“Can you see them?” 

Delbet shook his head. 

“No.” He pointed. “They ought to 
be somewhere there. To the right of 
the highway.” 

They looked together. There was 
no glimmer of light. If the rest of tfie 
expedition were there the watchfires 
had been allowed to burn out. 

If they were there . But the 
giant knew what to expect as light 
crept across the plain. Full daylight 
revealed the desert to be as empty as 
it had been before the expedition 
had arrived. Shevan, Zedward, Star- 
howl and the precious casket had all 
vanished. 

T hey were without food or 
water. They had no transport.

161 




Behind them lay the barren Gray- 
stones; ahead, the pass across the 
mountains and the possibility of en- 
counter with the hostile band that 
had sealed the cave. 

Certain that their enemies would 
return, Delbet and the Conducs 
moved to the south of the road and 
spent all day hiding in another cave 
trying to decide what to do. 

Two things were clear. The disap- 
pearance of their friends was due to 
the arrival of the hostile natives. And 
the three stranded men had a choice: 
either starve or freeze to death be- 
tween the Graystones and the moun- 
tains, or risk capture and try to reach 
the plateau beyond the mountains. 

“There’s no question,” said Del- 
bet. “We can’t stay here, not with 
longnight coming. On the other side 
of those mountains and to the west 
on the plateau stands Mandanar. 
Even if it really was Keren who came 
down from the sky in the aircar— 
even if he has control of the Thetans 
on the plain and has captured the 
expedition, Mandanar’s where he’ll 
head for. He’ll take them there for 
sure.” 

The Conducs looked at him and 
at one another, then lowered their 
eyes. The thought of Keren in 
power again and powerful enough to 
have abandoned Spadrox frightened 
them. They might have chosen the 
wrong side, 

“Besides,” the giant continued, “if 
we can reach the plain we may find 
some of your people to give us food 
and transport or just plain news of 



whether they’ve seen Shewy and 
Karel’s casket.” 



AT FIRST they moved only at 
/V night, parallel to the highway, 
trying to use what cover they could. 
The road was always empty. Not 
once did they see a sign of the 
marauding tribe. Delbet imagined 
that, having achieved all they needed 
to in a single night, the natives had 
withdrawn to the plain beyond the 
mountains. 

Probably they had no intention of 
returning. The cave was to have been 
a convenient tomb. If the interment 
had been at Keren’s prompting, his 
cousin would now think Delbet dead. 
That might give him the benefit of 
surprise if rescue were possible. 

As they climbed higher into the 
mountains the nights got colder. 
Freezing mist often his the sky at 
dawn and one evening the wind from 
the north had snow on its breath. 

They had not seen any sign of 
other humanity. To make haste they 
moved onto the highway and trav- 
eled during the day. They were thiii, 
bedraggled, footsore. Delbet took to 
wearing his Saivainte cloak all the 
time, partly as disguise in case they 
should be seen, partly as protection 
against the weather. 

They had not long begun the 
descent toward the plateau when late 
one afternoon they heard the sound 
of Conduc autos. 

They had passed a road inter- 
section two kilometers back, the first 



162 



IF 




road junction since the Graystones. 

Delbet’s first instinct was to hide. 
He feared that the caravan might 
carry the unfamiliar tribe of Conduc 
brigands who had penned him and 
the miners in the c^ve. But the trio 
was sighted and overtaken before 
they could get far from the road. 

The travelers were not hostile al- 
though they spoke like the others. 
They were curious, too, at finding a 
Saivainte and Conducs from such a 
distant tribe on foot on the road 
together but were quick to offer the 
walkers a lift. When the language 
difficulty had been partially over- 
come the leader told Delbet that 
they were b(3und for the old Galactic 
City at Mandanar. “It is said that 
Superom from Spadrox have re- 
turned out of the sky and brought a 
magic casket with them. It contains 
the intelligence of one of our former 
masters, preserved at distant Spadrox 
but soon to awaken and revitalize the 
world. 

“The ancient lore of our clan 
contains the belief that such an 
intelligence was preserved at Spad- 
rox. But it is a very ancient belief 
and no one has set great store by it 
for a long time. 

“I suppose that you, too, have 
come to the Plateau of the City for 
the same reason. The Saivainte are 
few now and were the teachers of the 
old Thetis. Your companions say 
that you come from beyond the West 
Water. Do you know of this magical 
casket, brother?” 

Delbet kept the hood of his Sai- 



vainte cloak shielding his face and 
tried to copy the deliberate speech of 
old Zedward. “Yes. It is the body 
and spirit of Great Karel, who missed 
the flight of his kind from Thetis. It 
has been preserved at Spadrox where 
descendents of the expedition, 
Superom who were not in stasis, 
formed their enclave.” _ 

The Conduc nodded. “The casket 
was brought in a machine from the 
sky by the last two survivors.” 

Delbet felt his heart slamming 
against his ribs. He was about to ask 
a question when the Conduc an- 
swered it. 

“They say one calls himself Keren, 
Regent of Thetis, although we have 
paid no allegiance to any central 
authority in my lifetime or that of 
my father or his father.” The caravan 
leader shrugged. 

“Who is the other?” asked the 
giant. 

“His woman, one supposes.” 

The curt acceptance of the ob- 
vious bruised Delbet. His brain 
struggled to grasp the thing that had 
eluded him for so long, but it slipped 
away under the Conduc’s next state- 
ment. 

“Messengers have been sent to call 
us to Mandanar and the old place of 
the Superom for the revelation of the 
intelligence.” 

“Perhaps we may travel with 
you,” said Delbet. “We became sepa- 
rated from our party. We were at- 
tacked by a hostile tribe in the 
mountains.” 

“Ah!” The leader nodded wisely. 



INHERITANCE 



163 




“The Askalan Conducs. They are 
fierce lonely people of the hills and 
the desert. Tell me, brother Sai- 
vainte, did you cross the Graystones? 
Is it the terrible place they say it is?” 

While the Conduc caravan moved 
forward onto the plateau Delbet in- 
vented a history of the journey for 
the old leader. As the giant talked he 
tried to order his thoughts. 

What had happened seemed clear. 
Keren had somehow recovered his 
dominance at Spadrox. Probably 
lurid tales of the problems befalling 
the expedition had filtered back to 
the enclave. Besides there was no 
knowing how much the dwarf Arc- 
weld had been able to tell his master 
before he had drowned. 

The Regent, by spreading fright- 
ening rumors of the hazard to Karel’s 
casket, could easily have regained 
power over his Thetan captors. He 
must have left Spadrox in the aircar 
and caught up with the expedition as 
it crossed the Graystones. There was 
no doubt now in Delbet’s mind that 
the strange apparition Shevan had 
seen was Keren’s aircar landing in the 
mountains. 

The Askalan people, cruel and 
lonely as the mountains in which 
they lived, would have suited his pur- 
poses well. While Delbet and his party 
had prospected for cruze, Keren 
and the Askalans had ambushed the 
others and easily overcome them. 

Now Karel’s casket was in Keren’s 
hands. Worse, so was Shevan. The 
thing she feared, the thing she had 
tried to tell him when she was a 



prisoner in the Tower had happened 
to her. With all his simple wifi he 
tried to hold on to it, to understand, 
but he could not. 

XV 

H e came to the city as though it 
had always been waiting for 

him. 

After several days’ travel, as soon 
as the friendly caravan made the final 
turn in die road, Delbet saw it. 
Immediately he was sure that some- 
how he had visited or dreamed of 
this place before. Perhaps this feeling 
was only a link with the memory of 
his forefathers; perhaps the vivid 
recreation of the talk-tapes Shevan 
had unwound for him was welling up 
from his subconscious. Perhaps Man- 
danar was no more than the in- 
scrutable place at the end of a 
journey— and in the end every jour- 
ney is the same . 

Beneath stars glinting like first 
frost in the pre-dawn sky the old 
galactic communications center of 
the Superom was a white wheel 
glittering on the plateau. Complex 
roads and support buildings radiated 
like spokes from the mathematically 
precise circularity of the central ar- 
chitecture. 

Mandanar had not degenerated as 
had the old cities the rulers had built 
for their subject peoples. No one 
except the troglodyte Submets lived 
in those stone jungles for fear of the 
awesome and vanished past that 
lurked there. The Galactic City had 



164 



IF 




stayed undecayed and inviolate, as 
enduringly simple and insoluble as a 
mathematical equation whose terms 
are infinite. 

As they approached, the giant saw 
a huge gathering of Thetans of many 
tribes. It reminded him of the 
assembly at Spadrox he and his 
cousin had effected so many weeks 
ago as part of their escape plan. But 
for this gathering there was no cer- 
tainty of revelation. 

Previously his determined little 
cousin had engineered events. Now 
that she was once again in the hands 
of Keren her deception would surely 
be exposed— unless by some miracle 
of intuition Shevan had sensed that 
truly in Mandanar lay means of 
reviving the dormant Karel and of 
finding some way to escape the 
despair of the planet with the dying 
sun. 

The caravan moved through the 
perimeter of the throng, looking for 
a place to halt. 

Delbet’s first instinct was to find 
and rescue Shevan. After that he did 
not care whether they tried to defeat 
Karen and recover possession of 
Karel’s casket or whether she might 
be persuaded to run away and forget 
her furious ambitions and be content 
to live with him in Thetis till the sun 
went out. Again he had a fleeting 
sense of some impending, hidden 
doom, but it would not stay. 

After the caravan had settled upon 
a campsite and had eaten a hurried 
meal, Delbet slipped away with his 
two miner Conduc friends. 



They decided to split up and 
approach the focus of the sprawling 
camp from different directions to see 
whether they could locate any of 
their comrades from the expedition. 
They had no difficulty deciding 
where the camp’s focus lay. The old 
Superom aircar which Delbet had 
repaired for the first escape had 
obviously landed on a small hillock 
at the camp’s edge. Scorch marks 
patched the ground where the car’s 
vertical lift had thrust. 

There could be no doubt now that 
the shape Shevan had seen in the 
desert had been that of the landing 
aircar. Keren had used it to follow 
the expedition. 

His fierce half-breed sons accom- 
panied him. They lounged around 
the landing point near some rough 
huts the Thetans had built for them. 
They bristled with weaponed arro- 
gance. 

There was no sign of Keren, 
Shevan or the casket. 

Delbet did not dare go close to the 
camp. He stooped so that his stature 
would be less obvious and, as the 
Saivainte were tall, his disguise in 
some measure excused his height. 
But the mere presence of what ap- 
peared to be one of such a rare tribe 
made him conspicuous. Fortunately 
most of the other Thetans-Conducs, 
Helangles, Agorans and many allied 
and cousin tribes-were busy with 
their morning meal, too busy to 
notice the lonely stooping scholar 
Thetan stalking through the camp in 
the uncertain light of daybreak. 



INHERITANCE 



165 




Delbet circled the hillock twice at 
a safe distance. He was not anxious 
to meet any of the other Thetans 
from the expedition yet. There was 
no way of knowing what fears or 
doubts Keren might have put into 
their minds about Delbet and Shevan 
since the Regent had captured the 
expedition. 

‘*I wouldn’t mind betting you’re 
looking for your brother, eh?” A tug 
at Delbet’s cloak and a cheerily loud 
voice coming from behind him made 
him spring around in a panic. 

A round, hearty Agoran had 
stopped him. The little man 
looked surprisingly like Mutch, but 
then most Agorans between the ages 
of twenty -five and fifty looked alike. 

“What brother?” Delbet mumbled. 
His heart was still thumping with the 
fear of being exposed. He drew his 
cloak around him and let the hood 
fall forward over his face. 

“Why now-don’t tell me you 
didn’t come all this way from across 
the West Water without the company 
of your friend and brother.” 
“Umm,” muttered Delbet. 
“Zedward!” chortled the Agoran, 
“who came with Regent Keren Sir 
and his lady. Come on! Don’t pre- 
tend you don’t know just because 
you don’t want to be seen bandying 
words with a vulgar Agoran!” 

“Not at all,” said Delbet. The little 
man was making quite a noise. One 
or two curious faces had already 
turned to stare in their direction. 



“Well, I don’t bear you any 
grudge. You’re a funny lot, you are. 
Living up in the mountains off kil- 
tawi’s milk and cheese. Must be a 
damn lonely life. Tell you what— 
your friend’s gone into the city with 
Keren Sir. That’s where he is. They 
went off in the flying machine. I was 
talking to one of the Helangles they 
brought with them. Talking! Well 
now— gibbering’s more like. Star- 
howl-I think that’s his name. Any- 
how he was telling me how they 
found this library or something con- 
trolled by a machine and full of some 
kind of old Superom mish-mush and 
they’ve left the Superom girl down 
there to-hey, don’t you want to 
hear-” 

With some mumbled words of 
thanks and apology the giant swept 
swiftly away. For one- thing he had 
heard enough; for another the garru- 
lous Agoran was attracting too much 
attention; for a third the formless, 
rootless premonition had struck at 
him again. Each time it came it 
gathered weight. It was as if he 
wandered along the surface of a 
sphere of darkness which contained a 
kaleidoscope of memories, forms, 
voices. But when he stretched out his 
grasping senses there was nothing for 
them to perceive. 

He felt sure that the reason for the 
look of permanence about the camp- 
site was due to the secrets of Man- 
danar, which remained elusive even 
to the descendents of the Superom. 
Keren must have discovered a 
memory bank in Galactic City. It 



166 



IF 




would be typical of him to leave 
Shevan there. He would require her 
to interpret the stored images and 
words for him. The possibilities of 
how the Regent might seek to per- 
suade Delbet’s unwilling cousin made 
the giant’s flesh creep. 

He could think of only one thing: 
how to rescue Shevan. All the objec- 
tives of their flight from Spadrox and 
her insistence upon the journey to 
Mandanar sank without eddy below 
memory’s surface. In Keren’s hands 
Shevan ’s future held only the dark 
ugly things she feared. 

The Superom inheritance on 
Thetis meant that to kill was an 
unimaginable crime, but he would 
need something to set against the 
potent neuroprobes which Keren and 
his sons carried at their belts. 

When the expedition had been 
captured the giant’s slingbow had 
been captured with it. He moved" 
slowly along the densely packed 
campsite. He walked hooded, head 
and shoulders bent in the oft-seen 
manner of the Saivainte— lost to their 
sunoundings as though deep in the 
contemplation of some line of pro- 
found thought. But his mind was 
alert. From beneath the hood he 
observed everything around him. 

Delbet knew that one of the Con- 
duc tribes served the Agorans by 
hunting the talue and supplying the 
precious fire-ore to the traders for 
sale. Many of them used slingbows. 

He made a complete circuit of the 
camp before he found what he 
wanted. Unobserved, he was at last 



able to reach tlirough tlie open 
window of a Conduc auto and steal a 
good bow and a quiver of bolts. He 
concealed them under his Saivainte 
cloak. 

From the rim of the camp he 
looked toward Mandanar. He could 
see the aircar perched near its center 
like a huge insect. 

The morning meal was over. Many 
Thetan groups were leaving the 
campsite for the surrounding coun- 
tryside. Presumably they would hunt 
food, trade, explore. Delbet left the 
camp, too. 

He circled north and approached 
the city parallel to an empty road. 

The buildings of Mandanar were 
more awe-inspiring than those that 
survived in the stone jungles. They 
were frequently blank-faced, almost 
entirely windowless, not built of 
stone but of a metal unknown to 
him. 

The hazard of being seen— he was 
the only moving thing on the de- 
serted boulevards between the giant 
spokes leading toward tlie center— 
finally overcame his fear of pene- 
trating the secret wheel. 

He passed three ramps. They could 
only have been designed to lead to 
entries or exits, although these ramps 
ended in a smooth vertical surface 
that held no visible clues. 

He was getting closer to the 
center. The motionless mechanical 
insect rested on the flat surface of a 
cylindrical structure. Most of its hull 
was transparent and he could see no 
one was in it. But its proximity and 



INHERITANCE 



167 




thus the proximity of his enemy 
made him uneasy. He climbed the 
fourth ramp. 

He was three-quarters of the way 
toward the top before the blank face 
of the wall relaxed. Its superb me- 
chanisms, obedient, immune to 
Thetan time, opened an illuminated 
throat where previously nothing had 
shown. 

Delbet lengthened his stride and 
found himself at last within a crea- 
tion made for his own kind. 

H e stood on a curved bay or 
platform that was part of an 
elliptical cylinder. In a wall below 
him were stacked a number of con- 
tainers of various, shapes, stenciled 
with hieroglyphs the giant could not 
understand. 

The door closed exactly and 
silently behind him. He turned and 
saw that the platform stood on a 
central column that enabled it to 
move around the walls of the cy- 
linder under the direction of its 
passenger. There was no doubt in the 
giant’s mind that the well was a 
receiving and storage point and that 
the platform was used for loading. 

The top of the cylinder ended in a 
railed gallery. Delbet was a fly 
perched on the wall about midway 
between the gallery and the hold 
below. His heart began to pound. He 
realized that if the mobile loader had 
ceased to respond to its controls he 
could well be trapped. 

He touched the control column 
with trepidation. 



It was pictogramed for manipula- 
tion by robots and could not be 
misinterpreted. He eased the manual 
rather stiffly in the direction of the 
vertical arrow. 

There was the trailing edge of a 
second while nothing happened. 
Then the vehicle shuddered and 
rose, jerkily at first but with in- 
creasing certainty, toward the gallery 
above. 

The giant moved down a corridor 
which ran straight for hundreds of 
meters toward the center. Either side 
of him were clearly defined doors, 
each of which mirrored its oppo- 
site. 

Delbet wondered if they were the 
doors to living spaces. None of those 
he tried would open. 

The corridor was interrupted only 
by elliptical galleries identical to the 
one through which he had entered. 
As he got nearer to the center they 
became more heavily stacked with 
piles of goods. 

The fifth one he looked into con- 
tained something much more fright- 
ening. At first he thought it was a 
body. Then he realized that it was 
only some special kind of protective 
suit, complete with helmet. No body, 
he told himself as he fled in fright 
down the corridor, could stay pre- 
served six hundred years unless it had 
the aids available to Karel. It was just 
a suit sprawled in an analog of 
human prostration on the loading 
platform. 

The giant approached the terminal 
of the corridor. More than once the 



168 



IF 




lingering premonition of so many 
recent days insinuated itself into his 
mind, forcing him to stare back over 
his shoulder. But if the ghosts or 
phantoms of his forefathers were 
here they had not revealed them- 
selves yet. 

He saw it as he approached the 
door: a sign still fresh, a warning that 
carried across six hundred years of 
night and oblivion. Control Area. 
Check all passes. 

The next second the door was 
open. There was no one to demand 
his pass. No one living . 

The demands the occupants of the 
control area made on the white-faced 
giant were those of his sanity. 

The control area was not large but 
must have been a nerve center of the 
complex. It was tightly compacted 
with, instrumentation and machinery 
on two levels and the seating pattern 
and control consoles were designed 
for manning. The horror" of the 
giant’s revelation was that they were 
manned! 

They were manned by the col- 
lapsed and contorted special suits. 
With his mouth soundlessly open, 
Delbet stared in rooted terror around 
him. 

One of the suits had" fallen back- 
ward into a chair. Its helmet lolled 
sideways onto its shoulder. 

The hollow caves of eyes and the 
absurdly toothy grin of the skull 
inside stared accusingly at the in- 
truder. Delbet closed his eyes and 
looked again. The suit carried the 
shoulder flash of the Superom Space 



Elite, the same badge the sleeping 
Karel wore at his chin. 

The giant backed slowly around 
the control console. He kept his eyes 
on the spectral commandant. One of 
Delbet’s hands tracked along the 
front of the console to guide him; 
the other gripped the stolen sling- 
bow. 

There were perhaps ten skeletons 
inside suits scattered about the con- 
trol area. They had all been suddenly 
smitten at their work by the brain 
disease that had emptied the planet 
of its rulers. These ten, like him in 
the suit in the loading bay, had not 
escaped. 

And now a new fear thrust Delbet 
back against the wall, as though to 
put as much space as possible be- 
tween him and the relics. Suppose 
the disease had remained potent all 
these years. Even now it might be 
advancing somewhere in his head, 
slowly extending its murderous ten- 
drils throughout his brain. 

He. fled. The next corridor was 
short and the signs over the entry 
read: Data Storage. Level One- 
Classified. Level Two -Recreational. 
Check passes Level One. 

Delbet could think only of what 
new confirmation of disaster might 
lie through the next. door. He had 
momentarily forgotten that he was 
not alone in the complex and that he 
had come with only one purpose. 

Heart hammering, he stood at the 
doorway. It opened soundlessly for 
him as all the other doorways had 
opened. 



INHERITANCE 




Behind him, the dr^ husks of suits 
sat at their timeless labors. 

Delbet found himself looking 
again into the dark hollows of eyes. 
But these were alive; these were the 
fatigue-ringed eyes of his cousin, 
Shevan. 

They looked at him without hope. 
They looked at him without recogni- 
tion, even without belief. 

A small frown crossed her face and 
vanished. “You — ” she said. 
“You’re— you’re dead. You— are 
dead, Del, my dear-” 

F or all he knew he might be. 

Inside this creation of the old 
super race that had dominated galaxy 
time, planetary and sidereal time had 
neither meaning nor purpose. Dizzily 
he knew that if suddenly the white 
spokes began to spin about their 
central hub they would soon become 
a blur. They and everything in them 
would merge and become indis- 
tinct— not subject to time but within 
it. When he had climbed the ramp 
and entered Mandanar, Thetis had 
ceased to be. Yes, he might be dead, 
or alive, or not yet born; past, 
present and future were indistin- 
guishable. Within the city he felt 
already whirling about him, temporal 
states had been extinguished. He did 
not know— even now he did not 
know . 

The girl half rose from the table at 
which she had been working. “What 
are you?” she whispered. 
“Shev-Shewy-it’s me, Del.” 
‘They buried you. They buried 



you! Keren did. They sealed you in 
the ground. Keren did!” 

Her real grief galvanized the giant. 
He moved quickly forward. 

“No. I escaped, Shev. It’s me. I’m 
real.” He held out his arms. When she 
did not move he realized she was a 
prisoner. A short, crude chain locked 
to a ring around her ankle secured 
her to the table. 

Delbet knelt. He seized the chain 
and pulled it angrily. Shevan gasped. 
She clutched his bent head. 

“No, Del! You’re hurting!” 

Delbet turned the chain and ring 
wildly in his hands seeking some way 
to free her. 

“Hush! Listen!” She sank quickly 
into her chair, pulling the giant’s 
head into her lap. Her hands warned 
him to be still. The silence rustled in 
the strange city. They remained mo- 
tionless for almost a minute. Nothing 
happened. No one came. 

“I thought—” she said in rushed 
whispers. “Keren— he’s gone to the 
revival sphere. Karel is there. The 
casket won’t respond. Keren and 
Zedward go there every day . Del, 
my dear Del— it is really you. How 
did you escape?” 

The giant told her in a few hurried 
sentences how he and the miner 
Conducs had escaped from the caye 
and how they had come at last to 
Mandanar. 

Shevan shook her head. “It’s all 
useless,” she said. “We’re doomed- 
— the last Superom, Keren, all the 
Thetans.” 

“What do you mean, Shewy?” 



170 



IF 




“Even Keren sees it. He was the 
last. Zedward saw it before me. 
Keren wanted to keep me here and 
to use the threat of the neuro-whip 
to make me work on the tapes in the 
library. So I haven’t seen much of 
Mandanar. But Zedward did. Zed- 
ward recognized it. He told me what 
he feared. Afterward I spent hour 
after sleepless hour scouring the end- 
less Tnemory systems. I found all the 
confirmation I needed. It all coin- 
cides ” 

“What?” said Del. “Realized 
what? Recognized what? What coin- 
cides?” 

“How much have you seen?” 
Shevan held his face between her 
hands and stared down into his 
scared eyes. Del shook his head, 
Shevan said, “We must stay here, my 
bal)y gianV until the sun goes out 
and extinguishes us along with it.” 

“The old ones- they didn’t leave 
any way for us? After all-” 

Shevan’s eyes filled with tears. 

“No way. No way because none of 
them found the way either. Even 
Keren saw it in the end. The struc- 
ture of the city, the skeletons in 
^ suits, almost all wearing helmets, the 
windowless spokes, the control 
centers. It seems they were all 
aboard. Perhaps they were even in 
countdown when the scourge struck 
them. Mandanar is a huge space 
vehicle, Del. A secret the Superom 
carefully guarded from the Thetans. 
It never left Thetis. It is a mausoleum 
now, a cenotaph, a tomb. Nothing 
more.” 



The immense, glacial truth of it 
froze Del’s thoughts. He stared at his 
cousin: the beautiful but haggard 
woman who had begun the journey 
as a child. He tried to shake his head, 
but her eyes denied him even that 
brief consolation. 

“Perhaps it’ll last. Perhaps it won’t 
go out, Shevan. The sun.” 

“No. Even you know it now.” 
“Keren? What-” 

“Keren is afraid. He’s more afraid 
now than ever. If the Thetans learn 
that the Superom can never return, 
what reason would they have for 
acknowledging Keren— or you or I or 
the shell of Karel kept alive six 
hundred years to no purpose?” 

“I can’t believe-I can’t believe it, 
Shev. Everything! AU we’ve done—” 
“Our cousin pins his hopes on 
Karel. He spent all his time guarding 
him in the tower at Spadrox. He 
needed for Karel to stay asleep. 
The dormant Karel was the authority 
behind Keren’s rule. Keren derived 
his power from the casket. Now he 
believes his only hope is in having 
Karel roused. The Thetans revere the 
last relic of their former greatness. 
Our cousin thinks that he can tap the 
store of knowledge Karel took with 
him into space and brought back 
alone. With that Keren will hold on 
to power. That’s what he believes.” 
“He’s crazy. We must stop him.” 
“The quasi-sun will do that,” said 
Shevan. “Given time that will stop us 
all. But I fear the time between. I 
fear that if Keren recovers his power 
now he will turn to me—” 



INHERITANCE 



171 




The giant stared at her with puz- 
zled eyes. 

“Until now his wives have been 
Thetan. The children they bore are 
half-bred. The Superom descendents 
of the survivors of the Fifth Vortex 
expedition had their genesis in the 
incubator stock from their cargo. But 
the incubators are dead. I am the last 
Superom female. Keren has it in 
mind-” 

“No!” The word that came out of 
Delbet was barely recognisable. “No! 
You— breed with that brute-his bas- 
tard hung in you-no! Shevan— for 
pity! No!” 

T he last cry, so filled with 

bitterness and anguish, evoked 
another. Delbet and Shevan lifted 
startled eyes. 

Keren crouched on the gallery 
above them. The silent doors of 
Mandanar had admitted him. No less 
astounded by the confrontation, 
Zedward was transfixed behind him. 

“You!” Keren’s snarl was little 
more than a whisper. His dark beard 
bristled as his jaw jutted forward. 
“The dumb giant. Betrayed again! 
They told me you were dead!” 

“No, my cousin.” Slowly Delbet 
drew up to full height. “I have 
come for Shevan.” 

“Masters!” The old Saivainte 
leader’s voice was as dry as fallen 
leaves. “Karel!” 

But Keren and Delbet were too 
closely locked on a collision course 
to heed Zedward. 



Keren’s hand was already moving 
backward raggedly to his hip before 
the giant put bolt to slingbow. Years 
of hunting talues had made him 
swift, but the Regent had too good a 
start. 

The neuroprobe was inaccurate at 
long range but the pain slammed 
along the giant’s right arm, gnawing at 
every nerve. His mouth twisted into a 
groan. His knees buckled. 

Shevan snatched the slingbow as it 
fell and with hasty aim leveled and 
fired. 

Slingbow bolts were not lethal and 
at worst stunned and anesthetized. 
Her wild aim, though, caught Keren 
full between the eyes. The bolt could 
not go deep. Stopped by the bone it 
jutted from his brow for a second. 
His head flung backward and he cried 
out in agony. The Regent’s hands 
groped, one for the bolt, the other 
for the gallery rail. 

He tore the bolt free but the drug 
in its tip had already spread to his 
nervous system. His eyes glazed. He 
pitched forward, hung for a moment, 
pivoted on the rail then over- 
balanced. He fell to the floor below. 
The sharp crack as his neck broke 
was sickeningly loud. 

Shevan screamed. Zedward leaned 
over the rail. His horrified eyes stared 
for a moment at the dead man. He 
looked up. 

“Delbet Sir, Shevan Lady!” His 
old lips worked dryly for a moment. 
Then: “Karel! Great Karel. We did 
too much. The mechanisms— failing. 
Life going— out.”

IF 




“Del!” The girl’s shriek raised the 
giant from the floor. 

“Hurry. Del!” 

The giant’s right arm was numb, 
but he used it like a club. The first 
blow buckled the metal table leg. 
The second tore it free. Blood 
trickled down his forearm from a 
gash as he wrenched the chain away, 
freeing Shevan. 

They ran. Even the spare old 
Saivainte ran. He led the way as door 
followed collapsing door. At last 
they reached the revival sphere. 

The six-hundred-year sleep was 
ending. The last of the Superom 
Space Elite had already begun to 
shrivel. The quiet anonymity of dust 
was waiting. 

Somewhere inside the hibernation 
casket a last spark pulsed alive. The 
casket fitted immaculately into the 
complex mechanism of revival. On 
the dark rectangular screen that re- 
corded brain activity, tiny threads of 
light still wandered. They were frag- 
mented and grew weaker as the 
powerless observers stood and 
watched. 

“Keren tried a last experiment,” 
Zedward whispered hoarsely. “The 
revival pulses were strong, then 
everything collapsed.” 

Shevan shook her head. Her face 
was ashen. 

On the screen the pulses had be- 
come virtually invisible. 

Delbet tensed. “The signs 
—Shevan— look— ” 

A weak pulse vanished. Suddenly 
there was a surge. 



“In the observatory!” cried I>el. 
“Shevan! The inscription.” 

“Yes. Look!” 

The anagramatic pattern rallied. 
The shrinking past was fighting to 
repeat a last message before its light 
finally went out. 

“It’s the same,” breathed Shevan. 
“The same code as the bank tapes—” 

The giant was staring at the bright, 
trembling messages: Karel’s last un- 
spoken speech. “Zone Kappa. Deck 
One-” 

“Code upper three, center five, 
lower seven, upper four, center six, 
lower eight. Quick, Zedward-we 
must record!” Shevan turned to the 
Saivainte. He was already scrawling 
the code on the hem of his cloak. 

“Sun,” Del intoned. “Nova Gene- 
sis— The t is— preservation -our 
home-against-” 

“It’s going out-he’s ending!” 
Shevan put her hands to her face. 
The last light fell in an arc to the 
lower edge of the screen and was 
extinguished. 



W HEN it was out the survivors, 
searched the central complex. 
The control zone of the great matrix 
which had monitored the birth and 
would have projected the flight of 
the Galactic City was clearly and 
logically divided. There were very 
few of the skeletal crew here. Those 
they found were of senior rank. Zone 
Kappa was clearly designated. Deck 
One was a program deck, a bank of 
gleaming keys.

“Yes, I understand,” said Del. “I 
didn’t know. But now I know.” 

“But even if the ship lifts off, Del, 
where will we go? Where will we 
finish? We’re not prepared.” 

The giant looked at her. He shook 
his head. 

“No,” he said. “It’s not that, 
Shewy.” 

“What then?” 

The giant stood in front of the 
deck. “Love—” he said quietly. 
“What they taught and what they 
left. Never to fail those who remain. 
Faithful in life. Faithful in death. To 
the principle. To the idea that made 
them walk upright and move out 
from the center to the farthest arms 
of the galaxy.” 

He stretched out his right hand. 
“Upper three, center five, lower 
seven, upper four-” 

“Del, darling. What is it?” 

“Watch, baby,” he said. “Center 
six, lower eight-” 

All the keys were depressed. 

“The message,” said Del. “Left 
here to be activated by a pulse from 
a thousand light-years away if neces- 
sary, but always the one simple 
word.” 

“Del!” 

“Watch!” The giant was looking 
for something. He found it. Suddenly 
on a curved screen before them 
appeared a huge panorama of sky 
and earth. 

The campsite showed clear, and 
parts of Mandanar itself, the distant 
mountains, the plateau to the west. 
The fading artificial sun burned heat- 



lessly in a clear sky. It was almost at 
meridian. 

The giant looked again. In a few 
hours he had discarded his long 
childhood like an unwanted skin. His 
left hand depressed a key marked: 
Stack. 

From power which had lain un- 
diminished for six hundred years the 
control deck took the numbers into 
the computer log. Alpha Ready 
burned in green symbols. 

“Yes,” breathed Del. Gently but 
firmly he pressed Activate. 

A short, jarring accumulation of 
power sped away. 

Then came a great flame, a light 
near the orbit of the dying star and 
burning with the brightness of a 
hundred suns. 

The gasps inside the tower multi- 
plied and echoed in a great cry of 
awe and wonder from the gathering 
Thetans as the message in the sky 
settled into a burning orb— a new sun 
that already dwarfed and threatened 
to engulf the old one. 

“Now we can begin again.” Delbet 
turned to his cousin. “With the 
message they left us. I understand. I 
know. Do you understand, Shev?” 

“In the way that women know,” 
she said. “Inside. Before anything 
conscious. Before understanding.” 

Zedward nodded, staring with a 
smile of triumph at the life the old 
Superom had left waiting in the sky. 

Shevan clung to the new Sup- 
erom— the giant, the commanding 
creature who had come into his 
inheritance. •

Re‘(i(^(};s <jfid wror 



Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I am an old-time sf reader -began 
with Amazing in 1926, moved over 
to the Campbell ASF. I began read- 
ing Galaxy with the first issue in 
1950. Now I have a complete file. 

I have If complete also, beginning 
with 1962. 

I read sf strictly for entertainment; 
not for instruction or to share a 
writer *s world protests or to be con- 
fused or puzzled. I do occasionally 
enjoy a mystery or a mystifying 
situation, if well written and ex- 
plicitly and well resolved. To leave 
the reader hanging may have been 
good for one shot long ago (The 
Lady or The Tiger), but imitations 
now are merely annoying. To leave 
something unsaid also used to be a 
way of dodging the censor -but not 
now surely. 

With the appearance of The Gods 
Themselves (taking its title from one 
of my favorite quotes) I began to feel 
I should resubscribe. What decided 
me (with some delay) was Gene 
Wolfe *s La Befana. That, I need not 
tell you, is one of the instant classics. 
It will be argued over, repeatedly 
reprinted and compared with Arthur 
C. Clarke *s The Star. 

What finally got me writing the 
check, however, was Bob Stickgold's 
Susie’s Reality. The idea, of course, 
is not new in sf-more recently one 
thinks of Jerome Bixby *s It’s a Good 



Life and the Charlie episode in Star 
Trek. But the chimp in this connec- 
tion is a new element and the em- 
bodified flashback is highly effective. 

Clifford Simak is one of my favor- 
ite authors, but Our Children’s Chil- 
dren brings a slight shock with its 
resurrection of the old-fashioned ' 
BEM (beautifully drawn on pp 6-7). 
See our next thrilling switcheroo 
installment? Best wishes. 

Charles F. Richter -Altadena, Calif. 

Bob Stickgold and his first pub- 
lished piece of fiction, Susie's Reality 
(IF, June ’73), have elicited more 
favorable reader comment than any 
new author If has been privileged to 
publish this year-and none, of 
course, worth more than an accolade 
from a reader of Mr. Richter’s broad 
background. Of himself Bob writes: 
“A brief biography? Born in Chicago 
in 1945, did undergraduate work in 
biochemistry at Harvard, getting a 
bachelor’s cum laude (almost every- 
one does) in three years. Then grad- 
uate work in biochemistry at Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, with a master’s 
and PhD. Currently doing post- 
doctoral research in neurochemistry 
at Stanford, with eventual aims at 
the biochemistry of memory, learn- 
ing and cognitive development (if not 
consciousness). That’s the straight 
side of me. Politically, I’m working 
with Science for the People, a group 
seeking to have science work for the 
good of the people, rather than the 
good of the corporate structure. 
Hopefully, I would like to get into 
writing some relevant (viable? Ed.) 
science fiction, but that awaits eph- 
emeral Time in which to work on 
it ... I hate being called Mr. (or Dr.) 
Stickgold, so call me Bob . .” 

Thank you. Bob. -JAKOBSSON
