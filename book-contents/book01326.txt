On Hugos 



I n case you missed it, we’ve got a 
piece of good news to pass along: 
at the World Science Fiction Con- 
vention in Cleveland, Labor Day 
weekend, the magazine to win the 
Hugo for best sf magazine in the 
world is — the one you’re holding 
in your hand right now! 

Naturally, we’re delighted. Nat- 
urally, we’re more determined than 
ever to try to hang on to it, now 
that we’ve got it. Seems to us the 
way to do it is by putting together 
the best stories we can find, and 
that’s what we’ve been trying to 
do anyway . but it certainly 
gives us added incentive. 

And it also gives us an idea. 



B esides If, the Hugos — that is, 
the annual science-fiction 
achievement awards given by vote 
of the members of each year’s world 
sf convention — went to: 

Best Novel: Tie between Frank 
Herbert and Roger Zelazny. 

Best Short Story: Harlan Ellison 
(for “ Repent , Harlequin /” Said the 
Ticktock Man, which we are pleased 
to point out originally appeared in 
our sister magazine, Galaxy.) 

Best All-Time Series: Isaac Asi- 
mov. 

Best Artist: Frank Frazetta. 
What struck us about the list is

that — well, say: wouldn’t it be 
a nice thing to have an issue of a 
magazine that contained stories by 
Ellison, Herbert, Zelazny and Asi- 
mov — and had a cover by Frazetta? 
Especially if the magazine hap- 
pened to be that other Hugo win- 
ner, //? 

The more we thought of the idea, 
the more we liked it; and what we 
are doing now is attempting to make 
it come true. We already have sev- 
eral of the stories, and Frazetta 
working on a cover; and we hope 
to have the rest shortly . and 
that’s what will be in If for March. 

It’s our way of saying thank you 
— very much. 

T he rest of the convention was 
interesting, too. We got to see 
of couple of TV and motion-picture 
previews — well, they were pre- 
views then; by the time you read 
this, they’ll be yesterday’s news, no 
doubt. But Star Trek, the new NBC 
television sf series, and the motion 
: cture Fantastic Voyage both re- 
ved rather surprisingly whole- 
urted enthusiasm from the view- 
. What is surprising about it is 
t just that they were good. That 
's very likely to happen, if only 
cause the producers of both had 
:e wit to get writers who know 
eience fiction to make up their 
'cripts for them. ( Star Trek has 
bought stories from Ted Sturgeon, 
Harlan Ellison and many other sf 
favorites; Fantastic Voyage was 
based on* a story by old-time sf 
writer Jerry Bixby.) What sur- 
prised us was that not only did 
these have the ingredients that 
pleased us aficionados, but they also 
have clearly begun to register big 



successes with the public at large. 
Say, fellows, do you suppose public 
taste has begun to catch up with 
us? 

Another pleasant sight at the 
convention was the clothes-of -to- 
morrow pageant sponsored by our 
companion magazine, Galaxy , and 
called, appropriately enough, A Gal- 
axy of Fashion. (Maybe you saw 
it on television if you weren’t there 
in person. If not, you may be get- 
ting some more chances; it will be 
carried on several programs this 
winter.) Some 22 glamorous girls 
dressed up in what they thought 
the well-dressed young lady of a 
couple centuries would be likely to 
wear. In some cases it was clear 
they thought they wouldn’t wear 
much — but that wasn’t too hard 
to take, either. 

Interested? You might think of 
coming around to next year’s con- 
vention and seeing for yourself. It 
will be in New York City, Labor 
Day weekend, and it ought to be 
something special. 

For one thing, it’s got a rather 
exceptionally well chosen Guest of 
Honor. You’ve seen him on these 
pages — most recently last month, 
as a matter of fact. And we see 
him quite a lot. It happens that, 
early in 1954, he and his wife came 
out to our home in New Jersey to 
spend a weekend. The weekend last- 
ed several months; then they bought 
themselves a house down the road 
and they’ve been there ever since, 
much ornamenting the community 
by their presence. 

His name? Why it’s Lester del 
Rey, of course. Can you think of 
a better choice?

IF • Novelette 




Two races had met on a collision 
course in space. Now the survivors 
of both had to learn to live again! 



1 

O ur Old Man is a good Old Man. 

His name is Colston McCall, 
and I don’t know what he used to 
do before. Now he’s Chief of Polic- 
ing for the Western District of 
Greater New York, and he knows 
what’s important and what isn’t. 



I was sitting under a big pine tree, 
feeling weak and dizzy. I had taken 
a load of aspirin, and my stomach 
wasn’t feeling right. But it was a 
nice sunny day. I could feel the 
soft, lumpy back giving in to the 
weight of my back. The branches 
made a sweet, shady canopy. 

The ground was soft under the 



7 





spongey pine needles, too, and it 
felt good sitting there, looking out 
over the meadows. There were wild 
flowers growing. 

We might have had that ground 
plowed up, and people planting 
things. But there weren’t enough 
people to plow up everything, and 
we had as many fields going as we 
had machinery for. We were doing 
our best. It still took a lot of people 
who had to go into the warehouses 
for packaged food that hadn’t spoil- 
ed. There just wasn’t any way we 
could have been organized better. 
We all had something useful to do, 
all of us who weren’t in beds. I 
shouldn’t have been sitting under 
any tree. 

But it was a beautiful day, and I 
had been hurting bad all night and 
morning. The doctors in the hos- 
pital had given me a piece of paper 
saying I only had to work when I 
wanted to. I guess that means I 
only had to work when I could stand 
it, but if they had written it out 
that way it would have made a 
sadist out of anybody who asked 
me if I would do something for him. 
We’ve gotten very careful. Very con- 
siderate, in nice practical ways. Our 
manners are lousy, because there’s 
no time to be polite, but it’s true 
what people used to say — the fewer 
people are, the more important peo- 
ple become. I remember what it 
was like back in the 1960’s, before 
the Klarri had their accident, but I 
can’t believe how mean people used 
to be to each other. I remember 
specific things they did to each other, 
and it gets me boiling mad because 
that’s how I’d feel if somebody 



tried to do that kind of thing to me 
these days. It’s how we’d all feel. 

I think some of the things that 
used to make us sick, before, 
came from living like that. I think 
that if I was fifteen years younger 
and just coming to make my own 
way in the world we have now, I 
wouldn’t have my trouble, and I 
wouldn’t have to sit here thinking. 
I mean, a man like me who had 
come so well through the Klarri 
sicknesses should have had a lot 
to do in this world, and instead I 
was shutting off because of some- 
thing the old world had done to 
me. 

I wished I wasn’t sitting under the 
tree. I wished I wasn’t trying to soak 
it all in. I knew that if I could, I 
would soak in all the sun and pine 
trees and wild flowers in the world, 
just for me. 

I had thrown away the note the 
doctor had given me on the back 
of a page torn off a calendar pad. 
Well, you don’t keep a note like 
that. Not when it’s been written with 
a pencil stub by the light of a gaso- 
line lantern in a big tent. Not when 
the doctor’s so tired, and the people 
in the tent are so bad off from sick- 
nesses nobody knows. I mean you 
don’t walk around with something 
like that in your pocket. I would 
rather just sit here for a while and 
feel guilty. 

But, you know, you can’t keep 
that up very long. You know all 
you’re doing is playing with your- 
self, because any time you feel guil- 
ty for having something simple and 
clearcut like cancer, you’re really

just pretending you can afford 
luxuries. I didn’t have to feel guilty 
about anything, not one blessed 
thing. But it’s human to feel guilty, 
and the thing about any kind 
of pain isn’t the pain. It’s that 
it turns you back to that wet, 
helpless thing you were when 
you were born. You know the 
sky and the earth have gone soft and 
could smother you or swallow you 
any time. You know it’s not that way 
for anybody else. Other people are 
still doing things in a world that will 
still be there and be dependable to- 
morrow. But you’re not. You’ve 
poled your raft to a one-man island 
of jelly. So you enjoy the chance 
to put splinters into yourself. And 
that’s playing. 

I was just starting to get up when 
Artel, my partner, came walking to 
me from the Old Man’s house. “Ed,” 
he said, “Mr. McCall wants to talk 
to us.” 

“Right,” I said, and the two of 
us walked back. Facing this way, I 
could see all the tents, and the 
houses that had been turned into 
offices, and the tracks of trucks and 
people cutting back and forth across 
what used to be the front and back 
lawns of the development. The whole 
thing was turning into a plain of 
mud, but at least there was a de- 
cent amount of space between the 
houses -and a decent amount of 
open ground to put up tents and pre- 
fabs on, instead of everything 
jammed together the way it was in 
the cities and towns. 

It was rotten in the cities and 
towns. Not just the fires, or the 
other kinds of trouble you get when 



a bunch of dose-packed people get 
awfully sick and lose their heads. 
We were over that, but still when 
you went into some place where the 
buildings were like walls along the 
street and everything should have 
been alive and working, selling shoes 
and groceries, the feeling of death 
would come over you and you 
couldn’t do anything useful. They 
used to talk about how people were 
all moving out of the cities, before. 
Maybe because they already had 
something like that kind of feeling. 
Anyway, this place where the Old 
Man had set up was a development 
out along Route 46, and back in 
there up in the hills there were 
lakes and wild animals, and you 
had a better feeling. You had bet- 
ter contact with the permanent 
things of the world. 

“Is he sending us out on some- 
thing?” I asked Artel. 

“Yes.” 

A rtel didn’t ever talk much. The 
Old Man had teamed us up 
about a year ago, and it worked 
well. Klarri are a lot like us. Their 
arms and legs are longer in propor- 
tion to their bodies, and their shoul- 
ders are wider. They have long, nar- 
row skulls, with all of the cerebral 
cortex formed over what would be 
the back of the brain in a human, 
so if you’re a highbrow among the 
Klarri, you’re a bigdome. When 
they haven’t washed for a few hours, 
there’s a light, rusty deposit that 
forms on their skins and turns them 
that color. And nobody likes the 
way their teeth look. If a human 
being had teeth like that, he had 



10 



IF 




some bad vitamin deficiency when 
he was a kid. But they’re decent peo- 
ple. When they look at a hospital, I 
think they feel exactly the way we 
would if spaceships of ours had 
brougjht pestilence to a whole world 
of theirs. 

There’s one other thing about 
Klarri. Their kids all walk bent for- 
ward, and so do some of their adults, 
because that’s the way their spines 
are. But they have a lot of trouble 
with that. It’s like appendicitis with 
humans, and there isn’t a Klarr who 
isn’t aware that he could have severe 
back trouble almost any time. So 
there’s a lot of them have had a 
fusing operation on the lower spinal 
column, either because they became 
crippled, or they started to feel little 
twinges and they got worried and had 
it done right away. It’s just like 
people. Only instead of appendicitis 
scars, the ones who’ve had the fusing 
operation have this funny way of 
walking and standing as if they were 
about to fall over backwards. Artel 
was like that, but he also had to 
wear a back brace because he’d been 
hurt in the lifeboat crash that killed 
his wife and children. Back braces 
are faster than re-fusing operations. 

You see, there can’t be any doubt 
about it any longer. You do the 
best you can. We don’t much be- 
lieve in theory any more. You can 
be as civilized as the Klarri, and 
know you shouldn’t go around con- 
taminating other people’s worlds, but 
when your faster-than-light ship 
breaks down and you’ve got to 
ditch, you pile into the lifeboats and 
you ditch. If you’re really lucky 
you’ve had your FTL breakdown 



within reaching-distance of a solar 
system, and the solar system’s got a 
planet you can live on; you come 
down any way you can, and you 
don’t put decontamination high on 
your priority list. Life is hard; it’s 
hard for Klarri, it’s hard for humans. 
You spend each day living with 
whatever happened the day before, 
and that’s it — that’s how it is in 
all Creation, for everything with 
brains enough. 

II 

C olston McCall was a big man — 
there must have been a time 
when he weighed close to two hun- 
dred fifty pounds. He was way over 
six feet tall, and now he was all 
muscle and bones except for a little 
bit of a belly. He was about fifty 
or fifty-five, I guess, and he would 
lean back in his chair and lo<5k at 
a problem and solve it in a voice 
that must have been hell on his 
help in the days when he was run- 
ning some kind of company. When- 
ever he raised his voice and called 
out a man’s name, that man would 
get there quickly. 

We went through into his office, 
and he looked up and waved us 
toward a couple of folding metal 
chairs. “Sit down, men.” We did, 
with Artel straddling his chair back- 
wards the way cowboys did in movie 
saloons. 

“How are you feeling, Ed?” 

“All right.” 

The Old Man looked straight at 
me for just a second. “Can you go 
twenty miles to someplace where 
there might not be any doctors?” 



BE MERRY 



11 




Well, the only other answer to 
that is, “No sir, I’m ready to lie 
down and die,” so I didn’t say that. 

“All right. There’s a town down 
the coast where nobody’s sick.” 

Artel sat up straight. “I beg your 
pardon?” 

The Old Man laid his hand down 
flat on a small stack of papers. 
“These people have never asked for 
any medicines. Now, I don’t know 
what that means. We first contacted 
them about two and a half years 
ago. One of our scouts found a party 
irom their town foraging through 
.he highway discount houses down 
along Route 35, there.” 

I nodded. That was the usual pat- 
tern in those days. The towns were 
all gutted on the inside, and any 
survivors had to start spreading out 
and looking for supplies outside. But 
that yras a mug’s game. You burned 
up what fuel you had, running emp- 
tier and emptier trucks farther and 
farther, coming back with less and 
less. What happened after that was 
they’d pool their remaining fuel, load 
everybody into the trucks and come 
busting up north, because everybody 
had the idea the big city had to be 
different. 

The Old Man went on: “Well, it 
turned out that, for once in a great 
while, these were the kind of peo- 
ple who’d stay put if we’d promise 
to send food down. So that’s how 
it’s been ever since.” 

And pretty grateful we were, too, 
F thought. 

“Well, that was all right,” the Old 
Man said, “but it’s getting to be too 
nuch of a good* thing, maybe, 
rhey’re not complaining at all. 



You’ve got to figure any medical 
supplies they might have had left 
would be pretty much down to basics 
by now. Your antibiotics and your 
other fancy drugs either don’t exist 
any more or have turned to mush. 
Well, hell, you know that.” 

We knew. It was the biggest prob- 
lem we had; things were tightening 
up pretty badly. And it wasn’t any 
use being able to grow penicillin or 
any of those fermentation drugs 
you don’t need much of a* plant for, 
in a pinch. All that stuff was just 
so much extra peanut butter on the 
sandwich for the strains of bug we 
had now. 

“But these people don’t seem to 
have noticed that. They don’t even 
complain about their food; they take 
whatever the trucks bring, they never 
ask for more, they never ask for 
anything different from what they 
get. I don’t like it when people don’t 
gripe about what we can deliver. 
And these people just take it and go 
away with it and never say a word.” 

CCT Tow many people?” I asked. 

-CA “A hundred and eighty-odd. 
I cut down their ration by three per 
cent just to see what would happen. 
They haven’t reacted at all. About 
the medicine, I had one of the drivers 
ask them if they needed a doctor, 
and they said no. They didn’t say 
they had a doctor, and they didn’t 
say they were all healthy. They just 
said ‘No’ and walked away.” 

“They’re either very lucky or very 
generous,” Artel said. 

The Old Man gave him a quick 
look. “I’m always ready to believe 
in those things up to a point. But 



12 



IF 




now I’d like to know if maybe there’s 
something they haven’t told anybody 
about.” 

Artel nodded. 

I wanted to know about the food 
part. “What kind of a town is it?” I 
asked. “What kind of people are 
they? Could they be fishing or farm- 
ing?” 

“Not in that country,” the Old 
Man said. “They’re just property 
owners — squatters, some of them, 
but it’s a community. All friends and 
relatives, all townies. Real estate 
agents, storekeepers, tree surgeons — 
all they know is how to sell cars and 
salt water taffy to each other.” He 
sounded angry. The same thing an- 
gered us all: it had turned out farm- 
ing was more than scratching the 
ground and dropping seeds into it. 
And it’s slow, besides being hard 
to learn. He’d tell you just the op- 
posite, but your hungry townsmen 
would rather die than farm. 

It sounds good, to just wave a 
hand and say, “Let there be light 
again.” But that's the kind of thing 
that drives you wild. The Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse are 
ducks, and they nibble you to death. 

“No, I don’t believe it,” the Old 
Man said, slapping the inventory con- 
trol forms again. “Go down there 
and find out about it. Come back 
and tell me about it, quietly. Quiet- 
ly.” 

“Of course,” Artel said. “It 
wouldn’t do to raise false hopes.” 

“Or even real ones.” That was 
what made him a leader and me and 
Artel troopers. Our Old Man likes 
to go softly. He might not have been 
a top man before, when you had to 



move bing, bing, bing because the 
competition was clicking along right 
behind you. But he was good for us 
now. 

You want to keep it soft. You want 
to take it slow and easy, and you 
have to know what to let slide. Can- 
cer, they say, used to hit twenty-five 
per cent of the population in one 
of its forms or another. They had 
been pretty close to cures, before. 
They weren’t any closer now, be- 
cause you can afford to ignore some- 
thing like that when you’ve had dis- 
eases that each kill sixty, seventy 
per cent in one summer. 

You don’t even care whether it 
was all the Klarri’s fault or not. 
They were in awful trouble, too, cast 
away on an uncharted shoal, with 
our diseases beating the hell out of 
their survivors, and them with 
fewer biochemists than we had. I 
mean — what are you going to do? 
You could have some kind of lurch- 
ing war and string them all up to 
lampposts, but there were better 
things to do with the energy, es- 
pecially now that the first impact 
had passed and most of us that were 
going to die of each other were 
pretty much dead. If somebody was 
to put me in a time machine and 
send me back to 1960, the people 
then ought to shoot me down like 
a mad dog in -the streets; I was carry- 
ing more kinds of death in me than 
anybody ever dreamed of, before. 
And if it wasn’t for this home-grown 
thing of my own, Td count as a 
healthy man by today’s way of judg- 
ing. So you don’t worry about yes- 
terday. You take what you have, 
and you work with it today.

“All right,” the Old Man said. 
“Go down there, the two of you. 
Maybe we’ve got a miracle.” That 
was as close as any one of the three 
of us got to laughing and clapping 
each other on the back and crying 
hallelujah. 

I went down to the hospital while 
Artel waited for me. I walked 
through to the back, to where the 
dispensary was. The idea was, if you 
were well enough to walk in and 
ask for medicime, you had better be 
sick enough to walk by all those 
beds and still want medicine. I saw 
them all; the ones with the sores, 
and the ones with the twisted limbs, 
the ones with the blind eyes, and 
the ones with the hemorrhages. I 
heard them and I smelled them, hu- 
man and Klarri. 

These were surviyors. The losers 
were dead. These were the ones you 
could expect still had a chance to 
live, if they could be kept strong 
enough to avoid things like pneu- 
monia and the other killers of the 
weakened. I still had some kind of 
low-grade lymph node trouble. My 
arms would go to sleep, and I 
couldn’t squeeze anything very hard 
without having my fingers go numb 
for hours afterward. While they 
were trying to do something about 
whatever bug it was that had made 
my lymphatic system react, they 
found this other thing that had been 
living in me for quite some time al- 
ready. 

It didn’t matter. I was around yet 
to walk down between the beds. 
Now, my Mary had drowned in her 
own blood. And I’d had this kid, 



about six, with his own little two- 
wheeler. A sidewalk bike, with solid 
rubber wheels, that was supposed 
to be for just diddling around in 
front of the house. Kind of a first 
step after graduating from a trike. 
There was an ice cream store that 
was open on Sundays fourteen blocks 
away from where we lived, and 
about ten days before the Klarri 
lifeboats came showering in from 
the sky, this kid and I had gone to 
that ice cream store, with me on my 
Sears, Roebuck three speed and him 
on that boneshaker of his. Six years 
old, and pumping away like mad 
with just a little four-inch crank 
sprocket that gave him no speed at 
all, and me reminding him to slow 
down and pace himself, and him 
grinning over at me as he went 
bouncing over the potholes in the 
alleys. Good little kid. 

T he dispenser nodded when he 
saw me coming. He was a young 
Klarr, usually with his head bent 
over a medical dictionary; the wall 
had human and Klarr anatomical 
charts, and there was a human clerk 
putting together the mimeographed 
pages of a new medical text. We 
were beginning to shape up. For a 
long time, now, the Old Man hadn’t 
been letting them put Klarr and hu- 
man patients at separate ends of the 
tents. The idea was, if you were doc- 
tor in the ward, by now you ought 
to be able to work most of the prob- 
lems you saw no matter who had 
them. You’d have maybe one or 
two Klarr patients in the hospital at 
any time. It meant something that 
you’d always have more Klarr than

that on the staff, or studying to join 
it. 

.Anyway, I showed the dispenser 
my Special Branch requisition per- 
mit, and he punched another notch 
on the edge of it and gave me a 
plastic bottle with twenty-five as- 
pirins, and I said thank you and 
went back out through the tent. 
There was a supply truck running 
down to Trenton that wouild come 
within twenty or twenty-five miles 
of this place we were going to. Artel 
had drawn a couple of bikes from the 
transport pool for us on his permit 
and was just lashing them on to the 
side of the truck. We got in and 
we rode in the back, on top of a 
bunch of cases and bags. Artel made 
a kind of a hump-back pad out of 
bean sacks for himself and lay down 
on his stomach. I wedged myself in- 
to a nice tight fit where I wouldn’t 
be bounced around too much, and 
after a while we took off. 

Ill 

T he name of the town was Ocean 
Heights. After the truck dropped 
us, we moved toward it through 
some very pretty country, using the 
Garden State Parkway for a while. 
We had good gear; Artel’s bike was 
a Peugeot and mine was a Raleigh, 
both of them fifteen-speed light- 
weights with high pressure sew-up 
tires and rat-trap pedals; they 
weren’t specially comfortable, but 
they were very fast on any kind of 
decent surface, and with all that 
gearing to choose from, hill-and- 
dale touring was a snap. 

We each had a .22 hunting rifle 



— the Old Man would have hack 
our hearts if we’d carried anything 
to kill more people with — and 
some food, some tools and a water 
bottle apiece. We looked very tech- 
nological, and you fed pretty good 
when you’ve got good gear. So we 
were both pretty well off in our 
own minds as we went zipping along, 
through the pine woods and along 
that smooth asphalt track. When we 
cut off and got onto Route 35, of 
course, we started running into signs 
of taffy salesman life — lots of 
roadside stands and one saloon 
painted DaGlo orange, and a lot of 
garden tool and outboard ' ‘motor 
shops, along with great big discount 
centers. All of it looked shabby, 
beat up, and just a shell. There was 
nothing left in the discount houses 
but phonograph records, and little 
plastic pots to raise rubber plants 
in, and games made by the Wham-0 
Manufacturing Company. The wind 
was in off the ocean, and that was 
all right too. ' I 

I t started to get dark while we wef§* 
still five miles way from Ocean 
Heights. That was the way we want- 
ed it. 

We took ourselves a couple of 
miles further, and then we cut out 
up a side road, into the woods. We 
found a good place to leave the 
bikes and made a little bit of a 
camp. It was good getting off the 
bike. Artel was walking very slow- 
ly, and he was leaning farther over 
backwards than ever. I didn’t remark 
on it; I guess I’ve already said that 
in our own eyes from ten or fifteen 
years before, we’d all seemed like 



BE MERRY 



15 




very rude people. Artel sighed when 
we were finally able to sit down 
and lean against something. So did 
I, I guess. 

We sat down close together. Artel 
had one of those squeeze type flash- 
lights that generates its own power. 
We put my windbreaker over our 
heads to muffle the light and we 
studied the map, laying out a head- 
ing for Ocean Heights from where 
we were. We’d be able to walk it in 
not much more than a couple of 
hours. We got our compass head- 
ings straight in our heads, and then 
we were able to come out from un- 
der the windbreaker, which was all 
right with me. One of the reasons 
Artel and I could work as a team 
was because I didn’t mind his smell. 
(That was what I said; actually, I 
liked it). But not in big doses like 
this. It was like eating a pound of 
milk chocolate. 

We’d done this kind of thing be- 
fore; we knew what we were doing. 
A couple of hours from now, when 
it was still dark and we could ex- 
pect most people to be thinking of 
sleep, we’d get moving, so that by 
the time we hit the place it would 
be tight-fast in dreamland. We’d 
ghost around and find out what we 
could. Get the lay of the land, figure 
an escape route and boltholes if we 
needed them. It sounds like playing 
Indians, but it’s the kind of technique 
you work out when you’re dealing 
with unkown people these days. You 
can’t even tell in advance sometimes 
whether they’re humans or Klarri; 
that was originally why a Special 
Branch team had to have at least 
one of each. 



W e sat in the woods and waited 
until it was time to move. Wte 
didn’t talk much as a rule. For one 
thing, what had happened to Artel’s 
respiratory system gave him a lot of 
trouble with breath control. For an- 
other thing, life’s too simple to need 
a lot of conversation. But it was 
lonely out there, and nightfall both- 
ers me. “Listen,” I asked Artel, “do 
you think your people will ever find 
you?” 

“Pretty unlikely,” he said after a 
while. “The volume they’d have to 
search is mighty big.” After a while 
he added: “It’d be better if they 
didn’t. We’d be as deadly now to 
our home as we were to you.” I 
could see him smile a little. “We 
Klarri here have traded too much 
back and forth with Earth. We’ve 
become much more like you than 
like our people.” 

He folded his arms with his hands 
over his shoulders, the way they 
do. “I don’t see much difference 
between us, in anything, really. Our 
machinery may be a little better. 
But most of us don’t understand it 
any better than you understand 
yours. We lose ships, once in a while. 
We don’t find them any more often 
than you’d expect. We have to pre- 
tend this isn’t so, because otherwise 
we couldn’t sell tickets to each oth- 
er.” 

“Travel agents about the same any 
place, I guess,” I said. 

He shrugged. “Civilization’s about 
the same any place. You take a ship 
from one star to another, and you 
say to yourself, ‘Here’s something 
my father couldn’t do.’ It’s true. My 
father couldn’t infect a world with a 



16 



IF 




population of three billion, either. 
Nor lose an interstellar passenger 
ship. And end with only a few thou- 
sand survivors from it. And have a 
whole future to solve.” 

He pushed himself down and lay 
on his back for a minute, with his 
hands behind his head, looking up. 
“I’m glad I don’t have to imagine 
how they’re going to do it.” He didn’t 
sound particularly worried; well, it 
wasn’t our problem. I’d heard hu- 
mans and Klarri talk about thines 
like what’ll happen when we build 
spaceships again. It’s a cinch they 
won’t be rockets; they’ll be a lot like 
the Klarr ships, I guess. But where 
will they go? Looking for planets 
where Klarri and humans from Earth 
could start the same business of 
living together, or contacting the 
Klarr worlds, or what? What would 
happen if we met Klarri from some 
political faction that didn’t like our 
Klarri? Well, there are damn fools 
everywhere, I guess. When the real 
problems really came, they’d more 
than likely have some shape of their 
own, and they’d either be solved or 
flubbed in some way that was possi- 
ble to their own time. 

“You heard about this new idea?” 
Artel said cautiously. “There’s some 
biochemjst with a hypothesis. He 
says that with two or three genera- 
tions of gene-manipulation, it might 
be possible to have Klarr- and hu- 
man-descended compromise people 
who could breed true with each oth- 
er. Think there’s anything to that?” 
“I’ve heard that. What do I 
know?” It shouldn’t have, but the 
idea made my stomach turn. I guess 
Artel felt the same way. 



“It’s an idea,” Artel said, and I 
could see he didn’t like it any better 
than I did. But that was one of 
those things the two of us didn’t 
have to worry about. And I appreci- 
ated what he was trying to do. You 
try to make as much contact as you 
can. Probably the Old Man has put 
us together originally because we 
were both lonely in the same way. 
Everybody wants to ’see a team as 
good as possible. Just for its own 
sake; not just because so many of 
the Klarr ships had happened to hit 
the Western Hemisphere. Other 
places, there’d been so few Klarr, 
I think they killed them all during 
the pestilence feelings. There were 
people who talked about national 
pride being involved; they said a lot 
of things like that, maybe getting 
ready to hand the next generation 
something they could go to war 
about. 

Talk’s all right in its place. Now 
we’d done some, Artel and I just 
waited in the woods. 

IV 

A t about ten o’clock we started to 
slide into the outskirts of Ocean 
Heights. These Jersey coast towns are 
all a lot alike. There’s always a high- 
way paralleling the ocean, leaving a 
strip maybe three miles wide with 
feeder roads running down to the 
Atlantic. Follow the feeder road and 
you find you’re on the main street of 
some town that was in its heyday 
in 1880. Right up near the water 
there’ll be a strip of big Steamboat 
Gothic summer homes; frame and 
shingle construction, three, four

storeys high, with lots of cupolas, 
and gingerbread, and maybe even 
an imitation widow’s walk. Big 
verandas, hollow wooden columns 
and lots of etched glass in the 
ground^floor windows. Some people 
think that’s a sign of gracious living. 
I think it just proves how much we 
wanted mass production. 

Closer in toward town there’ll be 
a lot of stores. Some of them will 
have bright new cast stone or alumi- 
num fronts, but the buildings are 
all fifty years old behind them. 
There’ll be a couple of yellow fire- 
brick structures, with almost anything 
in on their ground floors now, that 
used to be the A & P and the Wool- 
worth’s. Those moved out to the 
shopping center back in the 1950’s. 
There’ll be a couple of movie thea- 
ters, and one of them was closed 
long before the rouble hit the town 
itself. There’s a Masonic Temple, 
churches of various Christian de- 
nominations, a hotel for little old 
ladies and salesmen. Used car lots 
full of stuff carrying ten dollars 
worth of paint over the salt rust. A 
railroad track. A couple of tele- 
vision repair stores, and a weekly 
four-page newspaper dedicated to 
getting people to shop at home. 

On the ocean there are some sea- 
food restaurants, a miniature golf 
course and a building that looks like 
a horse barn but in the summertime 
houses a wheel of fortune and a cou- 
ple^ of dart-toss games, with most 
of the stalls standing empty even 
in the height of the season. The 
parking lot for the oceanfront amuse- 
ments is where the dog track used 
to be. The boardwalk is falling down 



everywhere. There are piles 1 and 
sheets of rusty iron sticking up out 
of the beaches farther along, where 
the boardwalk used to reach. The 
people say it’s the Republican legis- 
lators from the inland counties, with 
their blue laws, that killed these 
towns. If you approach from the 
beach, the first thing you notice is 
the plastic-coated paper from the 
frozen custard stands. It doesn’t 
mash up and wash into the ground 
at all; it just turns gray. 

We slid on in through the out- 
skirts. Artel said: “It was bad here.” 

L ooked like it. There was a lot of 
burnt pits full of bricks and 
pieces of charred timber, with dead 
trees standing around them, where 
there had been fires. There was all 
sorts of trash in the gutters, swept 
in from the fires and the general 
scraps that blow around and pile up 
when nobody collects them. The 
gutters were clogged with odd pieces 
of wood, tarpaper, sand and gravel. 
The sewer grates were all choked, 
and the streets were broken down. 
Rain water and frost had broken up 
the asphalt and undermined the ce- 
ment. Some of the streets had been 
laid in brick, and they now looked 
as if long walls had collapsed onto 
the ground. It wasn’t unless you 
looked hard, toward the ocean, that 
you could see the occasional lanfern 
burning and could believe that any- 
one lived on beyond this mess. 

We found only one street that was 
really open. It had truck ruts in it, 
with trash smashed down into them, 
and unmarked sand washed into 
pools in other places. The last sup- 



18 



IF 




ply run had (been a couple of weeks 
ago, and it looked as if our trucks 
were the only things that came and 
went. Once we had found the main 
drag this way, we moved off away 
from it and worked our way along 
the back streets. We came across 
dead cars, and the weathered tum- 
ble-down of barricades. Once I 
tripped over a shotgun with a broken 
stock, the wood grainy from rain- 
water and sunlight, the barrels just 
tubes of rust. “You’d think they’d 
have cleaned up the useful things,” 
Artel said. 

“It’s broken.” 

“But it could have been fixed.” 

“No, not here,” I said. The soil 
was sand, just one great big bar that 
the Atlantic had raised over thou- 
sands of years of pounding itself up 
against the rock coast of what were 
now the northern counties, and you 
couldn’t raise anything on it but 
scrub pine. West of the line running 
from New York down to Camden 
you were off the interstate highways 
and main railroads. The only thing 
you could do with this part of the 
world was sleep in it and play in it, 
and sell taffy to each other. We’d 
passed a horse-racing track coming 
in. Big looming plant, standing dirty 
in the darkness. Its parking lots had 
been full of cars, and there was a 
smell, originally trapped in all that 
wet upholstery, that hung in the 
air. That was as far as they’d gotten 
— the people trying to get out of 
the city. They were turned back by 
the local cops, cursing and sweating, 
and thanking God there was some 
place to point to where all those 
people could go to die. 



Farther in toward the town we 
passed the Women’s Club building 
— a big place with a phony Grecian 
front, that the local people had prob- 
ably tried to make into a supplemen- 
tary hospital at this end of town. We 
padded on up the steps, and there 
were three-year-old bodies right up 
against the doors, inside. We backed 
off. 

“We won’t find anyone living right 
around here,” Artel said. Twenty 
years from now, the Women’s Club 
building and the cinderblock walls 
of the bowling alley down the street 
would be all that stuck up out of the 
second growth. There’d be trees 
growing out of the sewers. 

W e crossed the railroad tracks, 
and we stood there as if we’d 
just sat straight up in bed in the 
middle of the night. The first thing 
I noticed was the smell of fresh 
paint. But there was plenty of other 
stuff to hit you, all at once. 

It must have been one of the 
best parts of the town to begin with. 
The houses were brick, two and 
three storeys high. They were all 
set in the middle of very nice lots, 
and most of them had those Georgian 
fronts that spell class. In daylight, 
we might have seen soot and patch- 
es in some of the brickwork, but we 
didn’t see it now. All the outlines 
were crisp and sharp; there wasn’t 
a warped board or a sagging roof 
anywhere here. There were neat, 
well located privies in the back- 
yards, we found as we started to 
move around. The fronts of them 
were made out of brick and had 
shrubs planted around them. 



BE MERRY 



19 




It was all like that. The hedges 
were trimmed. The lawns were like 
velvet. There wasn’t a chipped place 
in any sidewalk, nor litter on the 
grass, or anything. 

There were lanterns burning up- 
stairs in two or three of the houses. 
“What the hell?” I said. There were 
eight or ten solid blocks of this stuff. 
All if needed was a wall around it. 

“This is ’way off the supply 
route,” Artel said. “To see this part, 
you’d have to do what we did. You 
notice the trees — how thick' they 
are? I think they even had airplanes 
in mind when they picked this spot.” 
“Listen,” I said. From one of the 
houses, through a window open to 
the soft night air, you could hear it: 
“Bella figlia del amore ...” 

“What is that?” Artel asked. 
“Opera. Somebody’s got a wind- 
up phonograph.” 

“Or a generator.” 

“But no bulldozer to bury his 
dead with.” 

Artel looked back over his shoul- 
der toward the other side of the rail- 
road tracks. “That is different.” 

We kept moving, with faint music. 
There was no other living sound. No 
night birds, no cats in love, no dogs. 
There wasn’t any sound of people 
sneaking through yards. This town 
didn’t have teenagers who liked to 
visit each other. All these people 
were locked up tight in their little 
clean town-within-a-town, most of 
them sleeping the sleep of the inno- 
cent. The innocent and the healthy. 

We worked our way closer toward 
the ocean. We were only a block 
away from it. The waves were roll- 
ing in to the shore regularly and 



gently, making the only steady sound 
we could hear, now that we were 
out of range of the phonograph. I 
looked back over my shoulder, and 
I could see nothing but those 
few upstairs lights, some of which 
had been put out since we had 
gone by. Solid citizens turning in. I 
thought they were lantern lights. 
They might have been lightbulbs on 
low voltage. We were getting more 
questions than answers out of this 
town. 

W e got down to the beach, and 
we found another dirty fringe 
— a motel with its windows broken 
out, a playground with scrub bushes 
growing up among the teeter-totters 
and the monkey bars, a flight of 
wooden steps tumbled down the 
stone jumble of the sea wall. If you 
had been going by in a boat you 
would have never known about that 
neat little clean patch with its edged 
flower beds and its unlittered streets. 

There was a big, dark building 
just inland of the playground. Flat- 
sided and square, it was two storeys 
high, and the ground floor windows 
were well over the height of a man’s 
head, long and very narrow. If this 
was a war, and the building was at 
a crossroads, I would have reported 
it for a bunker. The sign over the 
doorway said “Ocean Heights Pro- 
fessional Bldg.” The double doors 
were at the head of a flight of stairs 
set back and flanked by solid, mason- 
ry. I could have defended it from 
the inside with one machine-gun. 
There was a padlock hanging on the 
doors, closing a chain looped 
through the handles.

IF 




“There was a gambling casino in 
Ocean Heights during World War 
II,” Artel said. He was the one 
who’d gone through the Old Man’s 
background file on the town. “It was 
closed by state investigators in 
1947 .” 

“We’ve found it.” Going by the 
delicately scalloped, once white- 
painted directory board bolted to 
the wall beside the stairs, an architect 
and a real estate agent had set up 
offices in it after the space became 
available. There was no sound in it 
now, and no lights. But I noticed 
something, and it made me wonder. 
I pulled in a deep breath through my 
nose. 

“It’s not empty,” I said. 

“I agree,” Artel said. “I have that 
feeling. And yet I can’t say why.” 
In the starlight, I could see him 
shake his head quickly. “It bothers 
me. It was built to be a hiding place. 
They might be doing almost anything 
in there.” 

“Let’s look around some more,” 
I said. 

“If you say so,” Artel said hesi- 
tatingly. 

The other thing we found was 
down at the beach. It was something 
looming, most of it under the water, 
the waves phosphorescing weakly 
against the one side that we could 
see. It stretched* away into the dark- 
ness, and its curved sides went up 
like the biggest dead whale in the 
world. I could see a long strut ex- 
tending out over the water at a shal- 
low angle, and the round circle of a 
landing pad hanging at a crazy angle 
from the end of it. It was a crashed 
Klarri lifeboat. 



“What happened to the people in 
it, I wonder,” Artel said. 

“They’re in that building back 
there. Locked up and kept out of 
sight,” I said. I had smelled them, 
the scent seeping out weakly through 
the double doors and God knew 
how many other barriers inside. 
“What do you want to do about 
it?” 

It was up to him. They were his 
people. If he wanted us to go in 
there and break them out now, I 
didn’t see any way for me not to 
help him. Maybe we could get away 
with it; I wasn’t crazy about the idea 
of trying to do all that without 
making any noise, but it was up to 
him. “Anything you say.” 

“Come off it, Ed. We don’t know 
anywhere near enough about the 
situation in this place. We haven’t 
found what we were sent for.” Artel 
sounded a little mad. He had a right 
to be. I’d as good as said he wasn’t 
a team man. I felt bad about having 
been rude. “Come on — let’s go 
back to camp. We had a plan and 
let’s follow it.” Artel slipped off in- 
to the darkness. 

I followed him. We didn’t say 
anything more to each other that 
night. We got back to our camp 
and sacked out. 

A team is a little bit like a mar- 
riage. I don’t care what anybody 
says, sometimes it’s better not to 
talk it out. It makes you feel like 
hell for a while, but you’ve got an 
even chance the next morning one 
or the other of you will say some 
thing in a friendly way and then the 
other one will feel relieved and it 
will be all over.

V 

I n the morning we went in straight. 

There’s no point to horsing 
around. If we’d had things like 
phone taps, snooper microphones 
and truth serum to work with, we 
might have decided on something 
different. But life’s too simple these 
days for any of that kind of stuff 
to be worth a damn. We’d just ask 
them questions, and then see what 
their lies added up to. 

Coming down to main drag on our 
bikes, we went right through the 
dead shopping district of the town 
and then cut right on a concrete 
street a couple of blocks in from 
the ocean. I figured we’d be coming 
up to signs of life soon. 

What we heard first was the 
sound of a ball bat from some field 
two or three blocks away and off 
to our right, somewhere near where 
the clean patch of houses was. We 
couldn’t see anything, but we could 
hear kids yell; it was the kind of 
noise you get from a schoolyard at 
recess time. 

We made another half a block, 
still going by houses that were all 
abandoned, and then we heard some 
little kid yelling “Daddy! Daddy! 
Daddy!” The sound of fast, little feet 
on the floor of a veranda went clat- 
tering in echoes along the street, and 
then a screen door slammed shut. 
We’d filially been spotted. We 
stopped and began walking our bikes 
up the middle of the street. 

About a hundred fifty yards ahead 
there was a traffic light hanging 
from guy wires over an intersection. 
There were a couple of gas stations 



there, and the drive-in apron of an 
ice cream stand. It made a kind of 
open pH ace where you might expect 
people to gather when you unloaded 
your supply truck. Between there 
and us there were a couple of houses 
that might be lived in. They didn’t 
have any broken glass in their win- 
dows, and there were light-colored 
streaks of unpainted putty in places 
along the sash. They didn’t look 
neat, but they looked livable. They 
looked about the way you might ex- 
pect houses to look in a. town, if it 
wasn’t a town on its feet enough 
to have that nice little residential 
section tucked away back there. 

A screen door slammed again, and 
this time we caught the direction of 
the sound. It was coming from a cou- 
ple of houses down and to our right. 
It was a big, green, three-story 
house, and we could see faces at the 
windows, but the glass was dirty, and 
we couldn’t tell much about them. 
What we could see was the man 
coming out from the veranda and 
walking down the front steps. He 
stood there for a minute as we came 
closer. 

He was a tall, thin, oldish-looking 
man with a checked shirt and suit 
pants, wearing glasses and carrying 
a pipe in his hand. He looked seedy 
and comfortable, with the pants 
hanging down flat and butt-strung 
behind, and the knees baggy in 
front. He waved a hand at us in a 
nice neighborly way, and then he 
walked around the side of the house. 
There was a sudden hammering of 
metal on metal — a wild, carrying 
sound — and all the other noises 
we’d been hearing stopped. The only 



22 



IF 




things to listen to were the steady 
wash of the ocean off to our left 
and the grit of our tires on the 
street. The man came back from 
around the house just as we reached 
his front walk. He had bushy salt- 
and-pepper hair growing out of the 
sides and back of his head, and a 
streak of it growing back from his 
forehead; his hairline was shaped 
like a thick-tined pitchfork, and he 
reminded me of all the retired men 
who might come around to your 
place in the summertime and help 
you build a rose arbor for a few 
dollars. 

4 4 J Towdy!” he said. “Didn’t hear 

A A you coming.” He was look- 
ing closely at Artel. I had the feel- 
ing he was having trouble making 
up his mind whether Artel could 
possibly be a Klarr. 

“Howdy,” I said. “My name’s 
Ed Dorsey. This is my partner, 
Loovan Artel. Artel’s his first name. 
What was all that racket?” 

The man came forward and stuck 
out his hand. “My name’s Walter 
Sherman. Got one of those iron fire- 
alarm rings set up next to the house. 
I kinda let people know when we’ve 
got company. PJeased to meet you.” 
He shook my hand, and then he gave 
Artel another look, very fast. He 
thought it over and shook Artel’s 
hand. “Pleased to meet you” 

“My pleasure,” Artel said, grin- 
ning a little. 

Sherman blinked once. He was 
trying to act right. He was doing 
pretty well, I thought, considering 
he hadn’t ever before seen a Klarr 
wearing human clothes and riding 



a bicycle. Sherman looked all 
right, too. He was getting old, 
but there was a nice glint in his eye 
and good color in his face. His hair 
wasn’t dead and dull, and the whites 
of his eyes were clear. He didn’t 
move or talk like a man who was 
anywhere near sitting down and 
waiting to get older. He looked like 
an upstanding gent, and you don’t 
get to see very many of those any 
more. 

I took a quick look around. 

There were people beginning to 
show up. One or two of them were 
coming out of nearby houses, but 
most of them were beginning to 
gather down at the intersection un- 
der the traffic light, coming up side 
streets and back from where the 
clean houses were. Just looking 
down that way, if you were a supply 
truck driver, say, you’d guess that 
they had all come out of the houses 
down there. “We’re from Philadel- 
phia,” I said to Sherman. “Survey 
team.” Artel and I got cards out 
of our shirt pockets and showed 
them to him. They were signed 
“F. X. Daley, United States Com- 
missioner, Philadelphia District.” 

“We’re just starting to check this 
part of the country,” I said as Sher- 
man took the cards in his hand and 
studied them, peering and blinking 
with the pipe in his mouth. The pipe 
was cold and empty — had been 
for years, probably. “We’d just like 
to find out a little bit about this 
community — how many people, 
what kind of social organization . 
that kind of thing.” 

“That’s right, sir,” Artel said. 
“We’d appreciate your cooperation. 



BE MERRY 



23 




Or if you’d rather direct us right 
away to your mayor or whoever’s 
in charge, why, we’ll get out of your 
front yard and let you go back to 
what you were doing.” 

“Oh, no — that’s all right,” Sher- 
man said, (handing us back the cards. 
“I imagine there’ll be some people 
from our Town Council here in a 
minute. Glad to help.” 

There wasn’t any doubt we were 
bothering him. He was talking off 
the top of his head and thinking 
very hard about something else. I 
wondered for a minute if these peo- 
ple had some way of knowing there 
wasn’t anything in Philadelphia — 
not a blessed thing — but it didn’t 
seem likely. One of the hardest 
things to be sure of in this world is 
nothing. 

ii'lXTell, come in and — ” he 
▼ ▼ waved with his pipe toward 
the steps of his veranda. “Ah, why 
don’t you sit down?” He was looking 
at the touring saddles on our bikes. 
“I imagine it might be nice to rest 
yourselves on something flat.” 

He tried to chuckle. He was trying 
to be pleasant, he really was. But 
we had caught him off base very 
bad by not coming into town with 
a truck engine roaring ahead of us, 
and by not both of us being human. 

We sat down on his front steps. 
We left our bikes up on their kick- 
stands, with the .22’s strapped down 
to. the carriers, just like any survey 
team would have. 

“You — ah — people look bush- 
ed,” Sherman said. “You come all 
the way from Philadelphia on those 
bikes?” 



I nodded. “Easy stages, yeah,” I 
told him. “There’s a lot to check 
out.” He looked a lot healthier than 
either one of us, that was for sure. 

“We ought to explain,” Artel said. 
“It’s the people who can’t do a regu- 
lar day’s work they can spare for 
things like surveys.” Like me, he 
was watching the bunch of people 
coming toward us. They were walk- 
ing fast. Not running; just coming 
on at a good pace. There were young 
and old, and a few kids, a good 
mixed human crowd coming to the 
railroad station to watch the stream- 
liner go by. A good, healthy crowd. 
Even not running, they were moving 
faster than any bunch of people I’d 
seen in years. They looked good; 
clean, eager. They looked the way 
people ought to look when something 
exciting is happening. You could 
see the front ones slow down and 
frown as they made out what Artel 
was. 

A freckled man in suntans and a 
rainhat, with squint-wrinkles around 
his blue eyes, came through them 
as they began to gather into a clump 
on Sherman’s front lawn. “Hi 
Walt!” he said as he came up to us. 
“I see you got company.” 

“Couple of government men from 
Philadelphia,” Sherman said. 

“Philadelphia, eh?” he said, 
shaking hands with us as we stood 
up. “My name’s Luther Koning. 
Pleased to meet you both.” 

“Luther’s sort of like our mayor,” 
Sherman explained. 

W hatever he was, he was the 
man we’d come to see. I 
guessed he was about fifty; all long,

IF 




flat muscle under that weather-tight 
skin, and able to act as if it was 
nothing unusual to see a Klarr walk- 
ing around outside that big, silent 
building out behind the abandoned 
playground. He had fast reactions, 
Koning did, and where other people 
had slowed to a walk and stopped, 
he had come on forward. 

“Glad to meet you,” I said. I told 
him my name, and I told him: “This 
is Artel, my partner.”, 

“Mm-hmm,” Koning said. “Well, 
I can see that,” he said in an agree- 
able enough voice, looking over at 
that bicycles and the two rifles. “Two 
equally intelligent races in the same 
jam, after all. They waste their 
strength in fighting, there’s no hope 
at all. So they work together. It 
makes sense.” He looked at me and 
then at Artel. “You look tired — 
both of you. Things still aren’t so 
good in the big city, huh?” 

“Things aren’t so good anywhere, 
Mr. Koning,” Artel said. “But we’re 
trying to make them better. That’s 
why we’re here.” 

“Why are you here?” Koning 
grinned again. “We’re standing here 
talking, and for all I know you two 
are anxious to get something done 
right away.” 

“They’ve got I.D. cards here from 
Philadelphia,” Walter Sherman said. 
He had gotten a chance to settle 
down some, and his voice was easier. 
But he was really fast in getting 
that across to Koning, even though 
he said it in a careless voice. “Gave 
me a turn, coming in that way. On 
bicycles.” He chuckled: “Real fancy 
machines, those are. Smart idea. 
Saves on gasoline.” I think the point 



he was trying to make was that we 
were dissimilar from the people who 
came in trucks, and that we might 
not even know about any other or- 
ganization. 

“We’re just trying to find out if 
you people need anything,” I said 
harmlessly to Koning. I was watch-, 
ing the crowd. There were thirty o 
forty of them, and it seemed to me 
that any time you can collect twenty 
per cent of the total population ai 
the drop of a hat, you’re dealing 
with an excitable population. E i 
they didn’t look jumpy the way a 
crowd of sick-nervous people might. 
You don’t see the kind of shuffling 
and fevery face-jerking you get some- 
times. These people weren’t looking 
for excitement. Sick people need 
excitement because it interrupts their 
misery. When they get it, they lose 
their dignity; it’s a dose of the stuff 
they crave, and when you pour it 
out in front of them they can’t hide 
how much they need it. These people 
weren’t like that. They didn’t need 
to be a mob. But they were very, 
very interested. Like members of 
the same club, and a famous guest- 
lecturer. There wasn’t a Klarr among 
them. That would have struck me 
even if I hadn’t known about the 
special building. 

I couldn’t make this crowd out. 

I kept looking at them; men of all 
ages, housewife-types in cotton print 
dresses, some of them with water- 
spotted aprons around their middles 
where they’d been washing up the 
breakfast dishes. There were young 
men in T-shirts, who looked as if 
they’d been working around the 
yard, and older men who were like 



BE MERRY 



25 




Sherman and Koning in looking like 
they’d lived useful, cheerful lives, 
and bad a lot of useful time in them. 
It was the kind of crowd that gives 
you the feeling life is comfortable 
and pleasant all the time. There 
wasn’t another one like it in the 
whole world. 

It bothered the hell out of me. 
Some of the kids had brought their 
gloves and started a game of catch 
out beyond the fringes of the crowd. 
Other kids were circulating back and 
forth; you couldn’t get their attention 
with a conversation on a veranda, 
but they were either going to be 
where the attraction was, whatever 
it was, or they were going to spread 
the news. Some of them had been 
up to Sherman’s house and back 
down to the intersection several 
times already. Now one of them on 
the edges of crowd yelled: “Here 
comes Tully!” Koning turned around 
as if he’d been shot, but he recovered 
nicely. 

“Hey! Let’s keep it down; we’re 
trying to talk here,” he said. But he 
kept looking sideways over at a man 
ambling along the sidewalk, so Artel 
and I did too. 



VI 

T ully was like one of those men 
you’ll see sitting on a beach- 
front bench staring out over the 
water. Nobody can do anything for 
or to them. They’re past the big 
tussle. He had given up trying to 
look as if God never made pot bel- 
lies, and was wearing loose-weave 
light pants with a big, comfortable 



waistline and big baggy legs. He 
had rubber-soled cloth shoes on and 
bright socks that you could see show- 
ing under the flipping cuffs of his 
pants. He had broad-strap suspen- 
ders holding up his pants, and he 
was wearing a short-sleeved, bright 
shirt. His bare arms were thin and 
knobby, tanned an even darker and 
shinier brown than Koning’s face 
was under his freckles. He was wear- 
ing a headband with a transparent 
green eyeshade. There was a fringe 
of white hair around his stuck-out 
ears, and the top of his skull was 
tanned and glistening. He had a big, 
amiable grin. He walked along as 
if he had all the time in the world, 
knowing that he was a center of in- 
terest, too, and the rest of the show 
would wait for him. 

Neither Koning nor Sherman said 
a word. People will do that. People 
think that if they stop, time stops. 

Tully ambled into the crowd, still 
grinning, and the crowd drifted out 
of his way. There wasn’t anything 
obtrusive about it; it wasn’t like the 
Red Sea parting for Moses into two 
straight-edged and shiny walls. It 
was just that they drifted out of his 
way, easily and naturally as if every- 
body in town knew from a baby 
that you didn’t stand close to Tully. 
Tully walked forward, still grinning. 

He cocked his undersized, round- 
chinned, round face up at the veran- 
da. He looked at Artel, and then he 
looked past Koning and me at Sher- 
man. When he spoke, his voice was 
high, like the cackle of a chicken 
with the biggest egg in the yard. 
“Ah-heh, Doc. Heard you had one 
of them Hammerheads visiting on 



26 



IF 




your porch.” He looked Artel up 
and down. “Looks like a prime ex- 
ample, considerin’ how puny critters 
are these days.” 

He looked at me now. His eyes 
under the shade were small and 
black, and smart. “His partner don’t 
look so good either, does he?” He 
stood there with his little squirrel- 
paw hands hooked into the front of 
his trousers, and when he began to 
laugh, first his cheeks quivered, and 
then the loose skin in his neck, and 
then his belly under the shirt, and 
then he was bouncing on the balls of 
his feet. But he didn’t make any 
noise. He flapped with laughter as 
he ran his eyes around from Sher- 
man and quickly across Artel and 
me to Koning, and then he began to 
turn very slowly and his glance didn’t 
miss one of the people around him. 
And then he walked away. He went 
back down the sidewalk the way he’d 
come, his hands still hooked in the 
waistband of his pants, his back 
shaking a little bit, the suspenders 
tight across his wizened shoulders, 
and a reflection of sunlight bouncing 
off the curved sheen of his eye- 
shade. 

“Well,” Artel said in an amused 
and careless voice, “I see every town 
has its character.” 

K oning rubbed his hand across 
the back of his neck, where 
the skin was seamed and granulated 
from years of exposure to sunlight. 
His jaw washout; I could see his 
lower teeth. They were wet and 
brown, and snaggled by oncoming 
age. The breath was pushing out 
steadily through his nostrils, making 



a very thin whistle. He took off ilia 
khaki rain hat and ran bis hand over 
his scalp. He put the hat back on, all 
without taking his eyes off Tully. 
The crowd was looking up ait us 
expectantly, and I believe half of 
them were holding their breaths. 

“I didn’t know you were a doc- 
tor,” I said to Sherman, as if this 
were interesting but not vital. Of all 
the things that had beeh happening 
to us since Sherman had given the 
alarm, this was the one that I 
couldn’t make out to have not no- 
ticed. “Want to make a note of that, 
Artel?” I went on. “It’s good news. 
It means we won’t have to send one 
of our own in.” Artel nodded and 
took a pad of mimeographed form 
sheets out of his pocket. He got out 
a pencil, licked the tip and made an 
X-mark in a box. 

“Doctor present. Right/* he 
mumbled boredly. 

“By the way, Doctor, congratula- 
tions,” I said to Sherman. “You 
must be doing a fine job here. These 
people look fine.” 

Sherman said quickly: “Now, wait 
— you’re getting the wrong idea. I’m 
no doctor. We don’t have any doc- 
tor. That’s just something that crazy 
old coot calls everybody.” His glance 
flickered over to Koning. 

“I ought to lock — no, God damn 
it, I . can’t . .” Koning wasn’t 
talking to me. He was talking direct- 
ly to Sherman. 

Whatever it was, it had them com- 
pletely shaken up. I can imagine 
how they must have planned for 
snoopers in advance, sitting around 
a kitchen table and nerving each 
other. “Well, listen , Luther — 



BE MERRY

whafll we do if somebody comes 
around asking questions?” “We’ll 
handle it , Walt . After all , it’s our 
town , we /ive here. The important 
things are all kept out of sight , and 
/low would they know what ques- 
tions to ask? Don’t you worry about 
it, Walt. You just always let me do 
most of the talking, and I’ll make 
sure they don’t find out anything 
but what we want them to know.” 
That was exactly how it had gone 
between them; it’s the kind of con- 
versation smart, decent men with a 
secret have held between themselves 
since time knows when. And it had 
worked, back when things were 
looser. 

They were looking at each other 
like two men tied to opposite ends 
of a rope, and the middle of the 
rope hooked over a spur of rock on 
the side of a twenty thousand foot 
mountain. 

“Oh. Sorry, Mr. Sherman,” I said. 
“Artel, looks like you’re going to 
have to start a new form.” 

“Yeah. Before I do that — Mr. 
Sherman, do you have very many 
seniles in your population? Will you 
require any special supplies — tran- 
quilizers or that sort of thing?” Artel 
asked. 

4 4TT7 e ll, I wouldn’t know,” Sher- 
w man, said doggedly. “And 
Tully don’t sfeem to do any harm, as 
long as you don’t pay him any 
mind.** 

“We’ve been very lucky here,” 
Kening said. He was beginning to 
get bade to himself. He was talking 
a little fast, and the wrinkles at the 
centers of his eyes weren’t com- 



pletely relaxed. But he was doing a 
good job of recovering. “We’re all 
healthy people here. Oh, once in a 
while somebody mashes his thumb 
with a hammer or something. But 
that’s not anything that can’t be 
taken care of. We live nice and quiet. 
It’s good. When I look back on how 
it was in the old days, I’ve got to 
say we live better. That’s a terrible 
thing, when you think of how this 
town used to have twenty-five thou- 
sand people in it and mighty few 
of them ready to be dead. But now 
we’ve got through the bad time, 
things are pretty good. For the live 
ones. Meaning no insult, maybe a 
lot better than they are for you out- 
side.” 

He was looking steadily at Sher- 
man. And he had come to something 
in his mind. He wasn’t back on his 
heels any more. He was nervous, and 
he didn’t like to trust his own im- 
provisations any better than any- 
body else would. But he was going 
to go with it, whatever it was. He 
wasn’t looking to Artel and me for 
his cues any longer. You could see 
that happening in him; you could 
hear it in his voice. “Look, gentle- 
men,” he said, stepping back and 
smiling. “I got taken up here in a 
hurry, and there’s a couple of little 
things that I’d like to finish up, if 
that’s all right with the two of you. I 
mean, this isn’t any kind of an em- 
ergency. It’s a surprise, but it isn’t 
an emergency. So if you could ex- 
cuse me for about a half hour, I 
could come back then and I’d have 
the rest of the day clear to talk to 
you. I’m sure Mr. Sherman can 
keep you entertained, and maybe fill 



28 



IF 




you in on some of the background. 
Just the general stuff; I’ll be back 
in time to give you the specifics. 
How would that be?” He grinned at 
Sherman with everything but his 
eyes. “Why don’t you take them in- 
side* Walt? Millie could maybe give 
them S little refreshment.” 

“Well, I don’t know — ” Sherman 
looked at Koning as if he had gone 
just as wild as Tully. “I mean, the 
house is a mess . 

It was sad, watching a man turn 
into a nervous housewife right in 
front of my eyes. 

“No, you go ahead and take them 
inside,” Koning said. “Don’t worry 
about the house.” He grinned again. 
“Relax, Walt! You’re just not used 
to company,” he chuckled. 

S herman nodded slowly. “All 
right,” he said, “take your word 
on that.” 

His face went through a spasm; I 
think he started to grin back, and 
then realized immediately he couldn’t 
make it stick. I didn’t dare look over 
at Artel myself, for fear we’d lay 
ourselves open in the same way. 

The crowd was livening up again; 
Koning’s starting some kind of ac- 
tion was taking the dismay of Tully 
out of them. The kids, of course, 
hadn’t stayed quiet for more than a 
minute. Some of them were back to 
playing catch, and some of the oth- 
ers had drifted on down the street 
after Tully — I didn’t know whether 
on purpose after Tully or just hap- 
pening to be headed in the same di- 
rection. I noticed nobody had tried 
giving Tully any catcalls or joshing, 
not even the kids. 



It was a nice town; they were 
polite to their sick ones. 

“It sounds like a practical idea,” 
I said. “And I sure could use a cool 
drink, Mr. Sherman. How about you, 
Artel?” 

Artel nodded. “Yo.” 

“Oh, well, sure,” Sherman said. 
“No problem about that. Got a good 
well down by where the 'Nike site 
used to be. Deep, Government-dug 
well. Lucky that way, too, we were. 
Lots of good water.” 

“Well, that would be fine!” I said. 
I could hear Koning sigh just a 
little bit. “Okay! So it’s all settled — 
Doc here’ll take care of you two 
fellows ’til I get back, and every- 
thing’ll work out just fine.” Koning 
turned and trotted down the steps. 
“Be seeing you!” 

I waved a hand cheerfully after 
him. So did Artel. “Well,” Sherman 
said. “Let’s — let’s go inside.” So 
we did. 

VII 

A blonde young woman of maybe 
twenty-five was waiting in the 
hall, carrying a baby over her shoul- 
der, one arm around it and 
the spread fingers of her other hand 
supporting it over the fresh, clean 
diaper. There were a couple of other 
kids clustered around her; a girl 
maybe a year older than the baby, 
and a boy in a T-shirt and corduroy 
rompers who was just under school 
age. He had little leather shoes on, 
scuffed up around the toes since the 
time this morning his mother had 
coated them with some of that polish 
that comes in a bottle with a dabber. 



BE MERRY 



29 




The little girl had her arms around 
her mother’s knee and her face buried 
in the side of her skirt. Sherman 
said: “This is my wife, Millie. And 
my kids. That’s LaVonne, and Walt, 
and the baby’s name is Lucille. Mil- 
lie, this is Mr. — ” He looked over 
at me. 

“Dorsey. I’m very pleased to meet 
you. This is my partner — ” 

“Loovan Artel. Loovan’s his fam- 
ily name,” Sherman said. 

Millie Sherman nodded, looking 
at Artel. Her eyes were very big, and 
the corners of her mouth kept twitch- 
ing. Finally she said, “Oh.” 

“It’s all right , Millie,” Sherman 
soothed. 

“We just need a place to sit, Mrs. 
Sherman,” Artel said gently. “Until 
Mr. Koning gets back.” 

“That’s right, honey,” Sherman 
said, throwing Artel a grateful 
glance. “Luther just asked me to 
give these men some refreshment 
until he gets back. He asked me to 
bring ’em in.” 

Putting the seal of authority on 
it seemed to buck her up, some. 
“Oh.” She wet her lips. “Well, won’t 
you come in?” She pulled the boy 
Walter out of the way and stood 
back against the wall. We were in 
one of those narrow foyer things, 
that runs through toward the back 
of the house and has doors opening 
off it into the main rooms, and a 
flight of stairs going up. 

“Let’s go straight on through to 
the kitchen. I’m sure you fellows 
don’t mind,” Sherman said. 

“Not at all,” Artel said, and we 
followed him toward the back of the 
house. I threw a glance into the 



living room as we went by. There 
were couches and a lot of chairs up 
against the walls, with a coffee table 
in front of each couch. There were 
books on the tables, bound in bright- 
colored cheap cloth. Novels. 

The kitchen was big, with a 
chrome-legged table, wooden cabin- 
ets and a lot of chrome-legged chairs 
with padded plastic seats and backs. 
Next to the capped stub’ of a gas- 
pipe coming up through the floor 
was a cast iron wood range, and in 
the sink was a big, galvanized iron 
pan with the washing water in it. The 
drinking water was in a regular of- 
fice-type water cooler with a big glass 
bottle held upside-down in it. And 
in one corner, standing spindly- 
legged, was a kerosene refrigerator. 
“Well, now, that’s something,” I said, 
nodding toward it. “You people are 
really starting to get straightened 
around here.” Sherman’s eyes fol- 
lowed mine. He looked at the re- 
frigerator as if all hope were lost. 

“I have to have it,” he said. 

“Oh? Are you a diabetic?” I said. 

W hat happened to his face now 
was like nothing I could recog- 
nize, but if he had been made out of 
strings, I could have heard them 
snap. The look 'he gave me was damn 
near unbearable; I might have been 
a cobra. 

Without taking his eyes off me, he 
said to his wife: “Millie, I’m sure 
you and the kids have things to do 
elsewhere. I can take care of these 
gentlemen by myself. You go on 
Millie. You go on, now.” 

Millie nodded and backed out of 
the room, taking the kids with her.

The kitchen had a swinging door on 
it, and it swung shut. 

“What do you mean, am I a dia- 
betic? All the diabetics are dead.” 
“It’s just that refrigerators and 
insulin go together in this house, 
Ddctor,” I said. “And before you 
tell me again you’re not a doctor, 
any fool can see Koning doesn’t care 
any more whether we find out or 
not. Artel, you figure his office is 
across the hall from that waiting 
room?” 

“Uh- huh. I could smell the an- 
tiseptics.” 

“Look, Dr. Sherman, why don’t 
you relax?” I said. “Koning told 
you that, and I’m telling you that. 
So you’re getting it from both sides, 
and you might as well believe it. 
Let’s sit down and just wait. We 
can talk if you like. Koning’s ob- 
viously gone to do something.” 
“Town Council meeting, I guess,” 
Sherman said desperately. 

“I figured something like that. 
Take it easy, Doc — it’s us that 
may have our heads in a noose. 
Artel, drift out there and see what 
his office looks like, will you?” Artel 
nodded and went out. I could hear 
Millie Sherman gasping out in the 
hall and Artel murmuring some- 
thing reassuring that ended in “ ‘scuse 
me, Ma’am, kids . .” 

Sherman sank down in one of the 
kitchen chairs. .He held his head in 
his hands with his elbows on his 
knees. “You had to bring one of 
them in with you,” he mumbled. 

I pulled another chair away from 
the kitchen table and sat down. 
“Well sure, Doctor. He’s a United 
States citizen. At least where we 



come from he is, and he’s got just 
as much right to walk these streets 
as I have.” 

“You don’t realize what you’re 
doing to us.” 

“No, I don’t, except I know guilt 
when I see it. But it’s a pretty good 
question who’s doing what to whom.” 

Sherman’s head came up fast. 
“What do you mean? What do you 
know?” 

“Whatever we know, we’ll know a 
lot more, and if we never go back 
to tell our Old Man about it, why 
that’ll tell him something, too.” 

I started to talk very fast. I had 
him on the ropes, and win, lose or 
even, I was going to press that as 
long as Koning would let me. “What 
do you people think you’re doing 
here, Sherman? Living in some little 
world of your own? You may think 
so, all fenced off behind a bunch 
of skeletons and burnt-out houses, 
but there’s a whole goddamned 
world out there, and in the middle 
of the night sometimes you know it. 
This is just one town. One town, in 
a whole country. On a continent. On 
a world. We’re not just dying out 
there — we’re living and breathing, 
too. You think it’s fun for me and 
Artel to come down here and play 
patsy with you people? There’s no 
time for that.” 

H e was white and sweating. He 
was shaking his head back and 
forth. “No. No, this is a good town. 
You’re not the only people we’ve 
seen. We’ve seen other people from 
outside. YouTe all sick — all of you. 
You’re weak, and you’re in pain. 
I’ve been watching the way you

IF 




move, Porsey. You treat your bones 
like glass. I can imagine what it’s 
like out there. You lived through it 
— you were the lucky ones, and 
look at you! Your livers and your 
kidneys must be like old pieces of 
sponge. Your lungs are in rags. And 
maybe, maybe if you get halfway 
decent food, and enough rest, and 
enough time, you’ll slowly get back 
toward what you were. But most of 
you will never make it. Your kids 
might — for those of you who’ve 
got the energy for parenthood, and 
those of you who can successfully 
transmit immunities to your off- 
spring. What’s your infant mortality 
rate, Dorsey? What’s your live birth 
rate? Who takes care of your kids? 
Who educates them? Who keeps up 
the public sanitation? How many 
psychotics have you got?” 

Artel came back into the kitchen. 
“All he’s got in his layout is surgical 
stuff. He’s a bonesetter. Just about 
the only medicines he has are aspirin, 
iodine and vaseline. Funniest doctor’s 
office I’ve ever seen. Well, Koning 
told us. But it’s no surprise they 
thought they ought to hide it.” Artel 
got a chair for himself and sat down 
watching Dr. Sherman with a sleepy, 
unwavering expression. “I’m sorry 
your wife and children are so upset 
by me,” he Said. Sherman nodded 
blindly, not looking up from the 
floor. 

“Boy’s by my first wife,” he said. 
“I married late. Always figured it 
would be too big a change in my 
life. Got older, changed my mind.” 

“You’ve been very fortunate,” Ar- 
tel said. 

“I know it. There isn’t another 



family in town with two survivors. 
You think I didn’t know the odds, 
when I finally realized what we had 
on our hands? What do you think I 
wouldn’t have done to save Mary 
and the boy both? It was hopeless 
in the hospital by then. I voted tq 
dynamite the place, it was so bad. 
Didn’t matter — if they’d all voted 
with me, there wasn’t time nor sensP 
or strength to do it. Man, you can 
know how to swim, but when the 
wave hits you the next thing you 
know you’re smashed up against the 
shells on the shore. I came home, 
and I barricaded this place. Had big 
pans full of carbolic acid, soaked 
rags in it and stuffed them in the 
windows. Had spray guns full of dis- 
infectant. You could barely breathe 
in here. What good was it? I wasn’t 
even thinking. We were all out of 
our heads. We were sick, and we 
were using it all up. When it started, 
we were using up the antibiotics as 
if we could always order another 
truckload in the morning. Had lab 
technicians — technicians — work- 
ing up slides, and had all the doc- 
tors out on the floor. We did every- 
thing backwards. We couldn’t be- 
lieve — ” Sherman held his head and 
laughed. “We couldn’t believe what 
was going to happen. We couldn’t 
act like we believed what was going 
to happen. I mean, if we’d let our- 
selves think about what was going 
to happen — ” 

He stood up quickly. “I never 
got you your water.” He went to a 
cabinet over the sink and got out 
some glasses. 

“We kept listening to the radios, 
telling ourselves somebody some- 



BE MERRY 



33 




where would announce treatments. 
I had a radio with me everywhere I 
went, in my shirt pocket. I listened 
to that radio night and day, had my 
pockets full of batteries. When I 
couldn't get stations any more, I 
kept it on anyhow — kept it on 
wanting to know if WOR would get 
back on the air.” He pushed the 
glasses clunking under the spigot of 
the water fountain. 

“I wasn’t listening for any an- 
nouncement. I was just listening to 
the cities die. Every time a station 
went off the air, I’d say to myself 
‘There, you smart people at Mas- 
sachusetts General. There, you fancy 
labs down at Johns Hopkins. There, 
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Cen- 
ter — you couldn’t find it either.’ 
That’s how we were — you remem- 
ber how you were?” He came over 
to us and pushed the glasses into 
our hands. “Here. Here.” Water 
slopped on my wrist. 

VIII 

S herman went back to his chair. 

_ He sat there looking at us. His 
hands turned the pipe over and over, 
and the ferocity had taken hold of 
him. “Luther wanted me to give you 
the background. AU right, I’ll give 
you the background. What do you 
think happens to the organization 
of a place* like this? The water mains 
lead from a reservoir that belongs 
to a town fifteen miles away. What 
happens when they close the valves 
up there because they’re scared 
they’ll need it all to themselves? What 
happens to your food storage when 
your refrigeration goes? How much 



do you think we had stored around 
here, when we could always bring 
everything down from Newark in 
a couple of hours? What happens 
when you realize that’s all there is, 
hah, and you’re not going to bring 
any more from any place else, ’cause 
nobody’s producing any more, no- 
body’s packing it, nobody’s putting 
it on trains? By God, they fought 
for it in the dark! They broke into 
houses where fat people lived, some- 
times before and sometimes after 
they set * fire to a block on account 
of pestilence. 

“It’s dead, it’s dead out there,” he 
said, pointing. “You came in through 
it. You saw it. You lived through 
it where you were, but you were in 
a goddamned metropolis with the 
rivers to scoop water out of and the 
warehouses jammed up. Do you 
know what we had to do to clear the 
site for that well you’re drinking 
from now? They were dead! They 
were all dead, and we’d come crawl- 
ing through the gutters, we’d come 
through three hour journeys that 
took a block. We didn’t clear them 
out. We — we as good as burrowed 
through them. We were twisted 
around them like snakes.” He looked 
up. “Of course, it’s all clean and 
neat now,” he smiled. “Everything’s 
clean and neat. This is a model 
community.” He wiped out his eye 
sockets with the backs of his hands. 
There was sweat drenching his shirt 
under the arms. 

“Drink your water,” he said. 

“Thank you,” I said. I took a 
hearty swallow. “I gather you didn't 
save your Mary.” 

“No,” he said bitterly, outraged 

IF 



34 




at my manners. “I didn't save my 
Mary.” 

Well, I hadn’t even intended for 
him to get some of my point. But 
it would have been nice if he’d been 
able to realize you couldn’t buy any- 
thing with that story these days. They 
were always like that, when you 
contacted them. The loners — the 
ones we pick up in open country- 
side because they used to be farm- 
ers — would run around our town 
for days, telling their particular 
story over and over again. 

It always took them a while to 
understand that nobody was listen- 
ing. The communities we’d contact 
couldn’t believe that the rest of the 
world was just like them. They all 
had this vision that theirs was the 
only town blighted, even though 
nothing that used power or fuel or 
the cooperation of large groups of 
people could be seen in the world 
any longer. We had all run scream- 
ing. We had all spent everything we 
had, trying to run, trying to learn 
an answer, trying to hide, trying to 
wipe out. You could only be glad 
the world’s military was still shock- 
ed from what the air defense missiles 
had done to the incoming Klarr life- 
boats, because if they’d been full of 
their usual, spirit we would have 
found some excuse for unloading 
that stockpile on ourselves, too. The 
only special grief Ocean Heights 
might have would be from having 
that lifeboat land on their doorstep 
and provide them with five hundred- 
odd immediate centers of cross-in- 
fection instead of their having to 
wait their turn from the winds and 
the refugees. But I figured that 



silent building farther down canceled 
that excuse, too. And besides, Mary 
is a common name. 

44T 00k, Doctor,” I said, “we’ve 
1 .J got cards from the United 
States government. You remember 
the United States. We obviously rep- 
resent the return of some kind of 
social organization to the world. You 
see us — you see what kind of 
shape we’re in. You say you’ve seen 
other people. What’s more, you can’t 
tell me somebody in town doesn’t 
know how to build a crystal set. 
There isn’t much to pick up, but 
there’s something. You’re trying to 
tell me you’re cut off, but you’re 
not — you know what kind of shape 
the world’s in, even if what you 
know is only little bits and pieces. 
We’re sitting right here in your 
kitchen working on the little bits and 
pieces we know, and it adds up bad. 
It adds up real bad, Doctor, just 
from what you’ve given us. What’s 
going on in this town?” 

Sherman shook his head miser- 
ably. “I can’t tell you,” he whisper- 
ed. 

“You’ve been trying to,” Artel 
said. “You’re doing everything but 
putting it into words.” Sherman’s 
glance jerked over toward him and 
met pity. I don’t know whether he 
could tell that’s what it was on a 
Klarr face or not. “Doctor, you have 
a great secret in this town. But you 
are its only sentry. It’s possible to 
get as far as your house without be- 
ing detected. And then you call at- 
tention to yourself by hammering 
on a gong. When you and Koning 
talk to each other in front of us, you 



BE MERRY 



35 




make sure we notice every lie. You 
think Tully told us about you? We 
didn’t need Tully for that. But it 
was you and Koning who told us 
Tully is important — you and Kon- 
ing, and all your other neighbors 
and friends. When you tell us how 
things were in this town, you’re 
apologizing in advance for what we’ll 
know when we put all the pieces to- 
gether.” Sherman was going whiter 
and whiter. The wood of the pipe 
was creaking in his hands as he 
squeezed them and the skin slipped 
damply over it. “You couldn’t fool 
anybody who’s the least bit inter- 
ested,” Artel finished up, still gently. 
“You know that. You’ve always 
known that.” 

I put down my water glass and 
walked over to the refrigerator. “He 
marched us by the waiting room be- 
cause it was smart not to let us sit 
there and figure out he was a doctor, 
so we wouldn’t ask him any medical 
questions. He walked us right in 
here into the kitchen. Where the 
refrigerator is.” I opened it. 

Sherman cried out: “We couldn’t 
get two! We could only find one, and 
it made sense to keep it in the kitch- 
en!” 

I nodded. “And there was a fuel 
problem, too,” I said. I could 
afford to be understanding. I didn’t 
have the foggiest notion yet what 
the hell he meant. “It’s a hard 
world; we’ve got to economize.” 

I was looking through the re- 
frigerator, and it was dark enough in 
there so that I was having trouble. 
There were a couple of heads of 
lettuce, wrapped in cellophane with 



the New York seal on them, and 
some leftovers in plastic covered 
dishes, half a sausage . and, up 
close to the weak cooling coils, half- 
pint cream bottle with a homemade 
rubber diaphragm stretched over its 
mouth. 

I took it out and held it up to the 
light. It was three-quarters full of a 
just faintly yellow liquid with white 
clouds stirring around the bottom. 

Sherman stared at it and me and 
Artel. Then he jumped up and made 
a lunge for it. He had his hand 
open, and he was trying to slap it 
away and smash it. His eyes were 
bulging. His face looked like it was 
a foot wide and made of chalk. 
“No, let me!” he panted as I duck- 
ed it out of his reach. “Please!” 

First, I stepped back from him, 
so that he fell clumsily against the 
standing cabinet, and then as he put 
his hands down to catch his balance, 
I said: “All right,” quietly, and held 
the bottle out. He straightened up, 
and I carefully put it into his hands. 
He stood looking down at it, and 
just as suddenly as he’d jumped up, 
tears began to fall on his shirtsleeves. 
Woebegone, he carefully put it back 
in the refrigerator and closed the 
door. He turned around and leaned 
his back against it. He took a long, 
gasping breath, and then he sniffed 
sharply. Well, anyone will when 
they’re crying. 

I looked over at Artel. 

“That’s the kind of setup they use 
when they want to measure out doses 
for injections.” 

Artel nodded. “He’d do his sterili- 
zation in here, on the stove.” He 
began opening cabinet doors, and 



36 



IF 




on the second try he found the 
leatherette-covered tin case with the 
syringes and the needles carefully 
nested. I turned to Sherman. “We’ve 
been in this town what — forty-five 
minutes? That’s how long it took you 
folks to lead us straight to the won- 
der drug. Sure this is a good town.” 
Sherman kept his eyes on the floor. 
He had shrunk inside his clothes. 
He was shuddering, and he was still 
weeping. I looked over at Artel. 
Artel shook his head — he couldn’t 
tell what that stuff was either. 

IX 

4 4nphat’s it, huh. Doctor?” I 
a asked. “The stuff in that bot- 
tle replaces all other kinds of medi- 
cines. You come into Dr. Sherman’s 
office with, say, liver flukes, a bad 
heart and a broken arm. He sets 
your arm, and he goes back into the 
kitchen and. comes back with a sy- 
ringe full of this stuff and squirts 
it into you, and you walk out smiling, 
all cured. You come in with spots 
in front of your eyes, a roaring in 
your ears and a sweltling in your 
armpit. Doctor gives you the needle, 
and six hours -later you’re dancing 
with your best girl. Doc, is that the 
way it is?” 

“Don’t make fun of it,” Sherman 
whispered. 

He was down to that. It was all 
he had left. We had broken him — 
well, no; the three of us together, 
and this town, and this world had 
broken him. That’ll happen, if you 
let it, every time. Sherman was say- 
ing: “It’s specific against Klarr- 

transmitted infectious diseases and 



allergic reactions. And it has broad- 
spectrum applications in treating the 
older forms of infectious disease. It 
won’t repair a damaged heart, no. 
But it reduces that heart’s burden.” 

He looked at Artel and winced 
the way he would have if he were 
hit with a gust of windy rain. “It may 
be a panacea,” he explained. “In a 
matter of hours after a three cubic 
centimeter injection, the subject is 
completely free of everything that 
can possibly be destroyed by an anti- 
body. I’m — I’m trying to make 
myself clear to you. The human 
body reacts to the stuff by manu- 
facturing counteragents which not 
only destroy it, but every other in- 
vading organism. At least, I’ve never 
seen the infectious disease that one 
dose isn’t effective for. I — ” he 
waved his hand in the air. “The 
population’s too small for me to have 
seen examples of all the sicknesses 
that humans could get. But it’s never 
failed me yet. And the reaction’s 
permanent. The only people we need 
it for is the new babies. There’s no 
disease in this town, Mr. Loovan.” 
The tears were starting in his eyes 
again; not the big, steady running 
wetness on his face he’d shown be- 
fore, but he had to keep blinking. 
“You see, the human body has its de- 
fense mechanisms. And this stuff 
stimulates them. Fantastically.” He 
shook his head violently and turned 
to me. because Artel had kept look- 
ing at him deadpan. 

“You can see it, Dorsev! You 
must know that the normal human 
being’s bodv is constantly engaged in 
staving off all sorts of potential ill- 
nesses. At any time, a great deal of 



BE MERRY 



37 




the human mechanisms’s functioning 
is directed toward the destruction of 
invading micro-organisms and the 
filtering and disposal of the resultant 
wastes. And I’m sure I don’t have 
to tell you how vulnerable the or- 
ganism is if it has been exhausted. 
And I don’t have to tell you how 
debilitating even simple illnesses are; 
at some time in your life you must 
have had a common cold, or a re- 
action to an infected tooth, or a 
cut. Can you imagine how much 
energy was constantly being drain- 
ed from your system by things as 
commonplace as that? Energy that 
could have gone to doing work or 
maintaining the growth and repair 
functions of your body?” He was 
shifting back and forth between the 
two of us now. We kept looking at 
him blankly because there wasn’t any 
need to encourage him and we 
weren’t planning to interrupt him. 
And he kept trying to get through 
to us — trying to get us to smile, 
or pat his hand and say. “It’s all 
right.” 

“Can you imagine what the 
population of this town is like? It’s 
free to devote full energy to life. 
There’s none of that gray, dragging 
stuff they used to come in to me 
with in the old days, that I couldn’t 
diagnose, and made them miserable, 
and I’d write tonics for. Do you re- 
alize how rhuch tension has been 
wiped out of their lives? They’re 
not nagged by a hundred little ill- 
nesses. They’re not terrified by sud- 
den stomach-twinges and mysterious 
rashes or coughing spells. They don’t 
find themselves spitting or passing 
blood. They don’t worry themselves 



into stomach ulcers, and they don’t 
come down with nervous diseases. 
When you add that to the fact that 
they no longer have many of the old 
social tensions . Don’t you see? 
It’s like a miracle for them! It’s like 
perpetual springtime — they’re alive 
— they’re vital. They don’t tire as 
fast, they don’t mope — ” 

“And they laugh all the time,” I 
said. “Artel and I could see that; 
running and dancing and singing and 
clapping their hands when they saw 
us. Like a bunch of happy South 
Sea islanders in a book. Nature’s 
Children.” 

Sherman ducked his head again. 
“They were pretty well off until you 
showed up,” he muttered. 

“No arthritis, Doctor?” Artel said. 
“No athlete’s foot, no kidney 
stones?” 

CCT didn’t say that,” the doctor 

A said. “If you had something 
like that before the Klarri came, 
there’s nothing that can be done for 
you except to make you generally 
healthier. That helps.” His head came 
up a little farther, “There is some- 
thing interesting about that, though. 
I don’t see any new cases starting. 
You can’t tell with a sample this size, 
but it just may be we won’t have 
any of that after this generation. 

“There’s a lot I don’t know about 
it. What I’ve got does the job it has 
to. But I’m not going to pretend to 
you that my extraction methods are 
exact. I haven’t got the time or equip- 
ment to isolate the precise effective 
fraction, whatever it is. I’ve got a 
bundle of stuff there, and some 
part of it does the job. The rest

doesn’t do any harm.” He was start- 
ing to gather /the little pieces of him- 
self hack together again. Talking 
shop was doing him good. Well, that 
had to be one of his reasons for 
talking shop. 

“What does it do for cancer, 
Doc?” I asked. 

“I think it prevents it. I know it 
doesn’t cure it.” 

“That’s fine, Doctor.” I looked at 
him from a long way away. I had 
an idea I was about to smash him 
again. 

I looked over at Artel. He had 
caught it in the doctor’s choices of 
words. It was sad to see his face. 
“Doctor — where do you get this 
stuff?” 

He had nearly made himself for- 
get it. He had been talking, and 
talking, and all the time his mind 
had been putting the screens back 
up. He stared at me as if I’d belched 
in church, and then he took a little 
half step away from Artel, a little, 
sidling, sheepish step I’m sure he 
didn’t know he was performing. “I 
extract it from human-infected 
Klarr blood,” he said, his mouth 
blowing each word in its own bub- 
ble. Artel sighed and bowed his head. 

I’d had my next question ready, 
and 1 was pretty sure of the answer 
to that one, too, but I had to stop 
and study him for a minute. Then I 
said. “And everybody in town 
knows where it comes from?” 

Sherman nodded, two or three 
times, slowly. “Alii the adults. I 
wish you hadn’t brought in Mr. 
Loovan.” 

“I think we’d better move, Artel.” 

He wasn’t keeping all his mind 



on the spot we were in, but he 
nodded. “Yo.” We pushed open the 
swinging door. 

“Wait!” Sherman cried behind us. 
“If you try to run for it, they’re 
bound to kill you.” 

A rtel was moving quickly up the 
foyer. “We know that,” I said 
over my shoulder. That kind of talk 
annoys me. I didn’t need him to 
teach me by business. Sherman’s 
wife and his kids were hanging over 
the bannister three-quarters of the 
way up the stairs, staring down at 
us. Artel hit the front door as hard 
as he could, slamming it back against 
the wall, and then kneed the screen 
door open so that it spanged against 
the outside house wall. The people 
standing around out there jumped. 
Well, that was the effect that he 
wanted. 

“Good-by, Mister Boogeyman!” 
the little girl piped as Artel hit the 
veranda with his boots clattering. I 
went just as fast behind him, slam- 
ming both doors shut. Artel didn’t 
slow; you never want to do that. I 
jumped the steps and picked up 
speed, so that we reached the crowd 
side by side. We went right by our 
bikes, picked the biggest man in the 
group, and stood with our toes prac- 
tically on his. “Where do 'we find 
Luther Koning?” I barked in his 
face. The rest of the people were 
falling back. Artel and I were both 
glowering and obviously beside our- 
selves with rage. The man took a 
step back, and we took a step for- 
ward. Artel reached down and 
grabbed his belt. “Come on, you! 
You’re fooling with the Govern- 



BE MERRY

ment!” The man waved vaguely 
down the street toward the intersec- 
tion. 

“Right!” I said. “Let’s go, buddy.” 
Artel pushed the man back firmly, 
letting go of his belt, and the two 
of us swung down the sidewalk, 
marching side by side, our feet com- 
ing down regular as heartbeats, our 
faces grim, our arms swinging. Kids 
and housewives scattered out of our 
way. “You can’t — !” somebody 
protested. 

“Well, then, you run tell him,” I 
said, and we kept going. 

t4T"\orsey! Loovan!” Sherman 

U shouted, coming down his 
veranda steps, his feet thudding 
across the lawn as he cut over to us. 
We kept marching. He came panting 
up to us. He was trying to keep up, 
but he kept losing speed as he turned 
to try to talk to us. I kept my eyes 
on the people down at the intersec- 
tion; there were a fair number of 
them down there, and I saw one of 
them notice us coming and freeze. 

“Dorsey!” Sherman panted. “You 
don’t understand. It’s not just — ” 
He tripped over the cover of a water 
meter, stumbled, and lost pace. He 
came trotting up even with us again. 
“Loovan — ” Then he realized he’d 
picked the wrong one to tell the rest 
of it to. “Dorsey! We were dying. 
We were too’ weak to move. We 
hadn’t eaten in days. We hadn’t 
eaten eftough in weeks, and all that 
time we’d been burning with fever. 
My wife was lying dead upstairs. 
For three days. And I couldn’t get 
up there. I had the boy In my office; 
on the examining table. I was lying 



on the floor. I couldn’t reach him. I 
had him strapped down. He was cry- 
ing. I couldn’t reach him. We were 
all like that.” 

“So were we,” I said. I had run 
out of patience with him entirely. 

But Sherman wanted to make his 
point. I had been waiting for him to 
tell me where their captive Klarrs 
were, and it seemed to me at the 
time that would be the only other in- 
teresting thing he could have left to 
tell us. Instead, he kept hobbling 
on: “You weren’t lost and cut off 
from the rest of the world! Do you 
know how bad the human animal 
wants to live? Do you know what it 
will do to keep alive? Do you know 
what it will keep trying to do, right 
up to the last minute? As long as it 
has its teeth and claws?” 

I was listening for any footsteps 
coming up fast and determined be- 
hind us. I was paying most of my 
attention to that. There weren’t any. 
We’d left them standing there. Now 
we were almost up to the intersec- 
tion. The Fourth corner was a big 
saloon-hotel thing, and I guess it 
was a town hall now, because I 
could see Koning and a bunch of 
other men come out quickly through 
the doors and stop dead, watching 
us. There was a grinning, jumping 
figure with them, pointing at us com- 
ing on and slapping his broomstick 
thigh, making the flapping cloth of 
his pants billow as if he had no 
bones at all. 

“It was Tully!” Sherman puffed 
out. “There was a lot of Klarr-killing 
going on for a while. Then we got 
too weak, and we gave it up. But 
Tully wounded one someplace where

they’d both crawled to die, I guess. 
Starving to death, both of them. 
Tully must have been just as far out 
of his head — just as far back to 
being a dying animal as you can get. 
You know what I mean?” he plead- 
ed. “You know how Tully was? It 
was just him and this dying Klarr. 
It was Tully. It was Tully that was 
the animal. But it was Tully then 
that had sense enough to come and 
save me — and save little Walt — 
after he was back to being a man 
again.” He barely got it out. “It was 
Tully who found out. I just refined 
his discovery. Made it nice and 
medical and sanitary. But you see 
how it is — they can't let the two 
of you go!” 

Artel had stopped dead. He had 
turned to salt in the blink of an eye. 
“Move. Move.” I said to him, 
“You’ve got to move,” still looking 
straight ahead, stopping dead with 
him. Whatever we did, we had to do 
it together. “If you don’t move, none 
of this gets back.” We moved. 

Now there were about fifteen or 
twenty people at the intersection. 
They were all men. They were 
wound up tight, moving their feet 
and hands back and forth. They 
stood on the corner in front of the 
hotel as we marched off the end of 
the sidewalk and across the street 
toward them. 

T ully was bouncing and grinning 
^at the crowd’s left. He had a 
lot of energy; a lot of drive. You 
had to figure him for spunk. For 
him to be the historical personage 
he was, he had to have had the per- 
sistence to have haggled hot raw 



meat with loose teeth in a mouth 
full of open sores. 

You won’t often find that kind of 
grit, even in your really desperate 
person. Even so, the nearest man 
to him was drawn a little away 
from him. Like the others in the 
crowd, he was watching Artel and 
me, but he kept darting side-glances 
at Tully, too. 

We walked up to Koning, who 
was trying to keep his face blank 
and was keeping it tense instead. I 
looked only at him; straight into his 
eyes. It was important to hit him 
before he could say or do anything. 
I said casually: “Well, it worked out 
the way you were hoping. Sherman 
cracked wide open and told us all 
about it. So you didn’t do it. It’s 
all out of your hands and off your 
mind.” 

Koning started to frown. “What 
do you mean by that?” 

Artel said “Look, Mr. Koning,” 
with his voice patient, “if you really 
didn’t want it taken off you, you 
would have made sure to ask the 
supply trucks for some drugs now 
and then. Whether Doc wanted to 
deprive the poor sick outside world 
or not.” 

“Now you can just be mayor,” I 
said. “That’ll be a lot easier, won’t 
it?” 

“Well, we’ve got things to do, Mr. 
Koning,” Artel said. “Let’s go, Ed. 
That building’s four blocks down 
and over to our right.” 

Sherman had been trying to catch 
his breath over to my right for the 
last few moments. He said: “I 

never — ” 

I gave him something that might

pass for a smile. “We know where 
the lifeboat is, too, Dr. Sherman. 
And those over there.” I waved my 
hand in the direction of the neat 
houses, off beyond the bulk of the 
hotel. “Well, you can see we have 
to open that casino building, Mr. 
Koning. Care to come along?” 

Koning’s jaw flexed a couple of 
times. He looked around, and once 
you do that, of course, you’ve lost 
it. 

He took a deep breath. And then 
nodded hastily, looking back at the 
crowd. “All right. Okay.” 

Artel and I stepped out. We walk- 
ed down the middle of the street, 
with Koning walking along beside us, 
and having to compromise between 
a casual walk and a trot, until he 
finally settled for keeping in step 
with us. Doc Sherman tagged along. 
One or two other people started to 
follow, and then the rest of them, 
and with the group that had slowly 
followed us down from Sherman’s 
house, it made a respectable bunch. 
Tully had set out down the sidewalk. 
He was keeping pace with us the 
best he could. He kept trying to 
attract the attention of people who 
passed near him. I could hear him 
saying: “Where do you think you’re 
going, you^ chicken punk?” He said 
it to young and old, irrespective of 
sex. “Where do you think you’re 
going, you chicken punk?” I could 
hear it as a fading mutter in the 
background. People were looking at 
him and then looking away. They 
were dodging around him, and 
twitching their feet nearer the center 
of the street. Except for him, no- 
body was talking. 



I n daylight, the building was paint- 
ed green. Not new — from be- 
fore. Artel and I trotted up the 
steps. Koning pushed himself ahead 
and unlocked the doors into the 
lobby. The crowd waited out in the 
street. 

The lobby was dark and musty. 
It was floored in a checkerboard 
pattern of red and brown vinyl tiles 
with a black rubber runner laid 
down over them. There were office 
doors opening on the lobby, but 
Koning went ahead toward a flight 
of stairs leading to the left. “Lantern 
around here somewhere,” he said. 

“Never mind,” Artel said, taking 
his flashlight out of his windbreak- 
er. We went up the stairs with it 
whirring. At the top of the stairs 
there was another set of double 
doors. Koning unlocked those. The 
smell kept getting stronger. 

There was some light coming in 
from one window near us. They had 
bricked up the rest from the inside. 
The entire second floor was one big 
room from here on back, and the 
open window was on this side of the 
row of bars and cyclone fencing 
they had put in from one wall to the 
other. Artel shone his light in 
through the bars. 

“We could see six iron cots with 
mattresses on them. There were two 
Klarri lying on two of them. The 
mattresses were turned back and 
rolled over on three others. There 
was another Klarr sitting on the 
edge of the remaining bed. He 
was wearing what was left of his 
shipboard clothes, I guess. 



BE MERRY 



4 * 




“All right, unlock that,” I told 
Koning, pointing to the pipe-and- 
cyclone-mesh gate that went from 
floor to ceiling. Some master crafts- 
man had worked hard and ex- 
pertly, custom-building that. Kon- 
ing nodded, went over to it and trem- 
bled the key into the lock. He pushed 
in on the gate, and it swung back. 
He turned around and looked at 
Artel and me expectantly. 

“I don’t think anything much is 
going to happen to you, Koning,” 
I said. “We don’t mess with com- 
munities if we can possibly help it. 
We all had to live through a bad 
time, and we all found out things 
about ourselves.” 

Koning nodded. 

“We didn’t find out what you 
found out. I’ll give you that,” I said. 

“But that was just luck,” Artel 
said; he took a deep breath before 
each phrase. “Just your luck. In- 
stead of somebody else’s, somewhere 
else.” 

Koning shook his head. “Listen 
— that Tully — ” 

“I’m sure Artel understands,” I 
said. “After all, you couldn’t do 
anything to Tully.” 

Koning said bitterly: “The son 
of a bitch kept reminding us and 
mocking us. He’d ask us if our arms 
were sore from Doc’s needle.” 

“I wish you’d go away,” Artel 
told him. 

K oning nodded again and went 
around us to go back down 
the stairs. He went down quickly, 
and then we could hear his foot- 
.steps in the lobby, and the sound 
of him going out through the double 



doors outside. He was not a bad man. 
Not the sort who would eat the 
flesh of a Klarr, no matter how 
hungry. Just the sort who would 
take a Klarr’s blood to make medi- 
cine out of it. And take. And take. 

As soon as it was all quiet, Artel 
began to tremble. He shook like a 
leaf. He put one hand on my shoul- 
der and squeezed. “Oh, Ed.” 

“Easy, easy,. easy.” 

“Chicken punks,” Artel muttered. 

The Klarr who’d been sitting on 
his bed had gotten up. He came 
shuffling forward, peering ahead. 

“Artel, I don’t see any reason 
why it might not work the other 
way. Maybe I’m wrong, but I don’t 
see why Klarr-infected human 
blood fractions wouldn’t do it for 
your people.” 

“They didn’t try that, though, 
did they?” Artel said with his eyes 
shut. 

“Well, they couldn’t,” I said. 
“They needed these Klarri to stay in- 
fected.” 

Artel nodded. “I understand 
that.” 

The other two Klarri had noticed 
something was different and had 
turned over on their beds. I speak 
a pretty good version of Klarr. 
“Hey,” I said to them. “We’re police- 
men. You can come out.” 

“What are we going to do with 
them, Ed?” Artel said. 

“Move ’em into one of the houses. 
I’ll stay with them until you send a 
truck down to pick them up. If you 
take a bike out to the Camden 
route, you’ll probably be up at the 
Old Man’s maybe late tonight, to- 
morrow morning for sure.”

IF 




Artel nodded. “All right.” He put 
his hand back on my shoulder as 
the white-haired Klarr came closer, 
got to the gate, and stood in it with 
one hand on each upright, leaning 
forward and looking out at us. 

“I am Eredin Mek, Sub-Assistant 
Navigating Officer. My companions 
here are very weak and may be 
frightened. Could one of you go in 
and speak to them, please?” He came 
closer. 

“Go ahead, Artel,” I said, and he 
ducked through the gate and walked 
quickly toward the back of the cell. 

“Is is possible to go outside?” 
Eredin asked me. 

“Certainly,” I said. 

“I’d like that.” 

We walked together to the stairs, 
and then, with him putting one hand 
on the bannister and the other over 
my shoulders, we got down the 
stairs and out into the lobby. I could 
see the crowd milling around out- 
side, and for a minute I thought we 
were in trouble again, but their backs 
were to the glass doors. Then we got 
out through those, and stood at the 
head of the steps. Tully was across 
the street. He was standing on the 
sidewalk, and he was saying some- 
thing to 'the people. They were 
ducking their heads away from him. 

Tully saw Eredin and me. He 
pointed over at us. “Hey, critter!” 
That made them raise their heads. 
They all turned, and when they saw 
Eredin leaning against me, they sigh- 
ed like an extra wave. Sherman and 
Koning were in the middle of them, 
pale. They could all see what it 
meant, the Klarr up there on the 
steps with me, stinking and sick, but 



out. Only Tully didn’t see what it 
meant to him. He thought he still 
had something going for him. 

He laughed. “Hey, critter! I 
b’lieve you’re even scrawnier than 
me! What’s the matter — ain’t we 
been feedin’ you right?” He looked 
around for his effect. 

“Who is that man?”. Eredin mut- 
tered, peering, groping like any sen- 
sible person will when he’s weak and 
is in a world he doesn’t understand; 
like somebody senile. “What’s he 
saying?” 

Klarr is a language that made my 
answer come out: “He is the savior 
of their tribe.” 

4 4XTah!” Tully was crying out. 

I “Yah, ya bunch a needle- 
pushing arm-wipers — ” 

“Ah, God!” Sherman groaned 
and turned and rammed badk 
through the crowd toward Tully. 
Then they were all as if they were 
being yanked on strings. They clus- 
tered suddenly around the squirrel- 
cheeked man in the green sunshade. 

I could see Koning’s face. The veins 
were standing out; his mouth was 
wide open, and what was coming 
out of him and all of them was what 
you might hear if all the lovers in 
the world were inside one big mega- 
phone. The people at the back of 
the crowd tried to push in. The whole 
mass of them fell against a tall hedge. 

Eredin looked up at me, squinting, 
his eyes watering; there had to be a 
lot of things he couldn’t know the 
reasons for. “They ‘ — they kept 
taking our blood,” he complained. 

“I know,’* I said. I patted him on 
the shoulder. END

IF * Short Story 



THE THOUSANDTH BIRTHDAY PARTY 

by DURANT IMBODEN 

Today was his birthday . and he 
dared not open his birthday gift! 



I t was party time. Or rather it 
would be party time soon. The 
event was scheduled for the follow- 
ing day, at six in the evening, and 
Ogilvy Carr, the guest of honor, 
was nervously biting his fingernails 
in anticipation of the party game 
which would have a most profound 
effect on the outcome of the affair 
— an affair which celebrated his 
1,000th birthday, as it happened. 

Carr chewed his fingernails in- 
deed. He pondered, and with each 
additional bit of pondering a little 
more calcium would leave his finger- 
tips and find itself lolling in the 
warm recesses of Carr’s mouth. 

“You’re chewing your fingernails 
again, love,” his wife said. 

Carr looked down at his hand. 
“Or somebody’s fingernails,” he said. 
“1 hardly know who I am — or 
who I’ll be — any more. I suppose 
I can thank medical science for 
that.” 

“And the government, of course.” 
Helen made the remark with a some- 
what tired smile adorning her face. 



“Of course,” he answered. 

“I suppose it is kind of interesting, 
when you think of it, how many 
people we’re made up of,” she said. 
“Heaven knows, my great aunt Nel- 
lie could be the donor of that new 
bone in my hip, or Uncle Herbie, 
bless his lovely soul, could some day 
replace my heart or my lungs or my 
left foot. That left foot will have to 
be replaced one of these days, you 
know . Dr. French said he’s will- 
ing to bet that in another fourteen 
or fifteen years it’s going to be can- 
cerous.” 

Carr wasn’t particularly happy. 
“And in fourteen or fifteen years 
. it could be my foot that re- 
places yours, you know.” 

“I hardly think so, Ogie. More 
likely someone like Uncle Herbie 
will have the honor. You do have 
very large feet, you know. I’m a 
ladies’ seven, of course, but you’re 
a fat man’s twelve. Our feet would 
hardly match.” She thought a 
moment and giggled. “Of course, I 
could take both your feet and look 



46 




like a duck. I could even go skiing, 
barefoot — and without skis.” 

“It’s hardly funny, my dear,” Carr 
said softly. 

“You’re quite right,” his wife 
agreed, this time speaking in a more 
serious tone of voice. “Ogie, love — 
Ogie, I’m so worried about the 
party.” 

L ots of people worried about the 
party. Practically anyone in his 
or her 900’s, as well as the kinfolk of 
these most senior citizens, worried 
about the party. For on a person’s 
1,000th birthday, the lucky fellow 
or woman would be the guests of — 
and participants in — the lottery. 

It was a lottery which decided 
not whether a man would win a 
soccer or baseball pool, or which 
women would be lucky enough to 
win a washing machine in a super- 
market drawing, but which men 
would live and which men would 
die; which women would live, and 
which would go on to their heavenly 
reward. 

It was, needless to say, a lottery 
of great importance for the people 
involved in it. And eventually prac- 
tically anyone of any signficant eco- 
nomic status would become involved 
in it, ^since the upper middle-class 
and the well-to-do invariably man- 
aged to reach their 1,000th birth- 
days. 

How? Well, the health of the na- 
tion and of the technologized world 
was booming. It took money to live 
to be a thousand, but then lots of 
people had money in this era of un- 
precedented prosperity. Most of 
them chose to spend a large share 



of their money on keeping their 
feet — not to mention the rest of 
their bodies — out of the grave. 
Medical science could work won- 
ders these days. If a man’s heart 
started to give out, all he had to do 
was undergo special drug and nutri- 
tive treatment. If that didn’t show 
results quickly, he would" be given 
a reconditioned heart from the or- 
gan banks. Or if there was a momen- 
tary shortage of reconditioned 
hearts to prevent this rehabilitative 
surgery, he could settle for an arti- 
ficial heart, which worked just as 
well or better, although it neces- 
sitated annoying yearly battery re- 
placements and interfered with re- 
ception on many transistor radios. 
If an arm or a leg became mangled 
in an aircar accident, or if a stom- 
ach decided to come down with a 
stubborn cancer virus, all that was 
needed was a trip to the hospital. If 
drugs couldn’t do the job, the organ 
banks almost invariably could. 

There was only one significant 
problem brought on by semi-univer- 
sal longevity, and that was over- 
population. 

Birth control had helped to allevi- 
ate the difficulty somewhat, but the 
fact remained that if far more peo- 
ple were being born than were dy- 
ing, Mother Earth would eventually 
have to give up trying to support 
them, since there would be no other 
alternative. The interplanetary col- 
onies would continue to absorb 
some of the excess populatipn, of 
course, but they were still relatively 
new, and their growth was limited 
by many logistical and economic fac- 
tors. 



THE THOUSANDTH BIRTHDAY PARTY 



47 




So one year someone came up 
with the idea of the lottery. 

I t was a simple idea, of course. For 
that matter, it wasn’t even a ter- 
ribly new idea. Prophets in the fic- 
tion and alarmist propaganda fields 
had been predicting similar lotteries 
for several centuries. 

In any case, the lottery was put in- 
to effect. It naturally upset a great 
many people. But necessity was 
necessity, and the world’s leaders — 
who were exempted from the lottery, 
by the way — accepted the inevit- 
able and told their subjects that they 
would have to do likewise. 

The plan worked quite simply. 
Whenever a person reached the age 
of 1,000, as verified by a check of 
government birth records, the lot- 
tery officials of his region would 
treat him to a birthday party. The 
primary game at the party was not 
Blind Man’s Bluff or Pin the Tail on 
the Donkey, but the lottery. And 
the lottery was a life-or-death game. 

It did help to make the party 
more interesting than the average 
party, though. 

After the senior citizen and his 
clan had enjoyed a feast of gargan- 
tuan proportions and had lightened 
their hearts and heads with synthetic 
champagne (far cheaper than the 
real stuff; government economy was 
always an important political issue, 
after all), the lottery officials would 
escort the guest of honor into a 
soundproofed, concrete room at the 
end of the long, concrete corridor. 

There one of the officials would 
unlock a large bin filled with Ping- 
pong balls. 



One of the balls was coated With 
a substance which would cause it to 
glow when placed under an ultra- 
violet light source. The senior citi- 
zen would be told to pick one of the 
balls from the bin; if he happened to 
be lucky enough to get the one 
which glowed, he would be escorted 
back into the banquet hall, and 
everyone would drink even more 
synthetic champagne, on the house, 
and jubilation would reign as the 
man blew out the candles on his 
cake and rejoiced in 'his good for- 
tune and in the most lovely and 
lasting birthday gift of all . im- 
mortality. Or at least as much im- 
mortality as medical science and the 
military-industrial power structure 
could promise him. 

On the other hand, if the guest of 
honor failed to pick the winning 
Ping-pong ball, he would immediate- 
ly be shot. A high-powered rifle was 
held by a hidden sharpshooter who 
kept it aimed at the back of the 
lottery participant’s head as he drew 
the ball from the bin. At a sign from 
one of the officials, the senior citi- 
zen would be sent into God’s king- 
dom without so much as a last ciga- 
rette. 

In such cases one of the officials, 
a psychiatrist specially trained to 
calm screaming relatives, would go 
back into the banquet hall to con- 
sole the next of kin and to extin- 
guish the candles on the deceased 
guest’s cake before the melting wax 
spoiled too much of the frosting.

“Ogie, honey, I’m very worried

about the party. What ir you don’t 
win the lottery?” 

“I think the answer to that ques- 
tion is fairly obvious, Helen. And I 
haven’t a chance in a million of win- 
ning.” 

“Kitty Murphy’s thirty-second 
cousin’s best friend’s brother won 
the lottery, Ogie. People do win it, 
after all.” 

“Yes, but how about the billions 
of other people who don’t?” Carr’s 
expression was glum. It reflected his 
disposition perfectly. 

“You’d better win the lottery, 
that’s all I’ve got to say.” 

“What do you mean, I’d better 
win the lottery?” 

“If they kill you, Ogie, I’ll kill my- 
self. I want to be with you.” 

“There’s no heaven, Helen.” 

“For me there is. And for you, 
because you’re mine. I’ve known 
'there was a heaven since ’way back 
in Sunday school.” 

“I hope there is, dear. I’ll admit 
I don’t look forward to not meeting 
up with you somewhere along the 
line. Although I’ll be damned if I 
want to spend eternity playing a 
bloody harp.” 

“Ogie, you’re going to die!” She 
blurted the words suddenly. “But 
I’m going Jo die with you.” 

“You can’t let yourself die, Helen. 
You’ve got too many years of hap- 
piness and excitement ahead of you. 
You’re only 258 years old.” 

“Our first batch of kids are grown 
up, Ogie, and we never got around 
to having more. I would have liked 
to have more, Ogie. But I guess it’s 
too late now.” 

“You could remarry,” he said, 



putting a slightly trembling hand on 
her shoulder. 

“Do you want me to remarry?” 
she asked. 

“No.” 

“There you are. And I don’t want 
to remarry, either. Even if you did 
have that other wife, I know you 
loved me best, and I don’t ever want 
anyone else, Ogie.” 

“Don’t say ‘loved’,* Helen. I 
don’t like to hear you speaking in 
the past tense already. You know 
I’ll love you right up to the end.” 

“And I’ll love you, too, Ogie. 
Only — ” 

“Yes, dear?” 

“Ogie, if there are girl angels up 
there, don’t go hanging around with 
them. Wait till I’m up there with you, 
okay?” 

T he official had just unlocked the 
bin. He stuck his arm down 
into the Ping-pong balls, up to his 
shoulder, and stirred them around 
quite thoroughly. 

“What are the odds today?” Carr 
asked, trying to sound light-hearted 
about the whole thing. 

“4,523 to one. Not very good.” 
“No. But then, I guess they never 
are, are they?” 

“I guess not.” 

Carr stepped in front of the bin, 
standing in the spot indicated by 
the head official. 

“You’re taking it pretty calmly,” 
the official said. “More calmly than 
most.” 

“I’m a fatalist,” said Carr. “I 
consider the game fatal. I didn’t 
come here with any hopes or illu- 
sions, anyway.” 



THE THOUSANDTH BIRTHDAY PARTY

“Well, you’re an odd one, then.” 
The official scratched his groin. 
“Hardly anyone ever comes here 
really believing that he’s going to 
die. I don’t think Vm going to, if I 
reach a thousand. Dying doesn’t 
seem very real these days. Most peo- 
ple hardly ever see it happen, and 
when you’re like me and you see it 
happening all the time, it becomes 
pretty mechanical. Maybe because 
everyone goes the same way.” 

“I guess so.” 

“The people back at the party 
are going to wonder what’s happen- 
ing,” the official said. “I guess you’d 
better go ahead and draw. I don’t 
like to keep the widows waiting. It’s 
harder on them when things drag 
on.” 

“Sure.” 

The officials all stepped back, and 
Ogilvy Carr reached into the bin. 

“You got it?” the head official 
asked. 

“Yes.” Carr sighed. “Come on. 
The hell with it — go ahead and 
shoot.” 

“Take it easy, pal,” the official 
said. “We’ve got to follow the rules, 
even if you’re in a hurry because 
St. Peter has offered you his job as 
head doorman at the Pearly Gates. 
Toss the ball over here.” 

“Yeah,” said another of the of- 
ficials. “let’s get the ball rolling.” 
No one thought it was very funny. 

Carr tossed the ball to the head 
official. The head official handed 
it to one of his assistants, who 
placed it under the ultraviolet lamp. 

Ogilvy Carr stood quietly, waiting 
for the inevitable. He listened care- 



fully, wondering if he’d be able to 
hear the marksman’s rifle hammer 
dick before the bullet reached his 
brain. 

“It’s glowing,” the junior official 
mumbled in astonishment. And like 
the sun rising on a new day, the 
ball was indeed glowing. 

C4T thought that bit about one of 
A them glowing was all a publici- 
ty gimmick,” one of the other of- 
ficials said wonderingly. “Luke, I 
thought they just let someone go 
every few million times to keep 
everyone’s hopes up.” 

“Well, it’s glowing,” said the head 
official. He went over to Carr and 
clapped him on the shoulder. “It’s 
glowing, sir. It’s glowing.” He 
stepped back a moment and sud- 
denly began staring at Carr in awe. 
“My Lord,” he exclaimed quietly, 
“you’re — you’re an Immortal.” 
And thus did Ogilvy Carr go back 
into the banquet hall, accompanied 
by the lottery officials and much 
thunderous applause, to blow out the 
candles of his birthday cake and to 
celebrate his status as an Immortal. 

“Thank God, Ogie,” his wife whis- 
pered after she kissed him wetly 
during their tight embrace. “We’re 
together, Ogie,” she whispered again, 
as the photographers’ flashguns 
popped all around them and she and 
her husband were clasped and kiss- 
ed by well-wishers. 

“Yes, Helen dearest, we’re togeth- 
er,” he whispered back. 

And they would be, at least for 
another seven hundred and forty- 
two years. END

The Starpafhers were always foo 
few and usually too late . but 
without them the galaxy was dead! 



I 

T ie light flicked from OPERA- 
TIONAL green to amber 
READY. I leaned back in the cush- 
ioned depths, took a deep breath 
and let it out slowly. My body auto- 
matically began the discipline that 
let every nerve, muscle and fiber 
approach controlled unconscious- 
ness. 

Without moving, I glanced at Ca- 
det DeLuso. The boy was quiet, but 
a fine mist covered his cheek. Nat- 
ural enough, under the circum- 
stances. First op-jump ought to 



bring out the sweat in a man, if 
he has any sense at all. 

The blinking amber said 12, 11 
— 10 seconds. I closed my eyes and 
silently wished Cadet Matt DeLuso 
luck. That’s the least you can do 
for these kids — wish them a little 
luck .... 

No, I caught myself — that’s not 
all, Waldermann. There’s one thing 
more. You can stop thinking of your 
Cadets as kids. They’re not kids at 
all, they’re men. And damn fine 
ones, too. If they weren’t, they 
wouldn’t make it this far — they 
wouldn’t be starpath candidates. 



51 




So, seconds before jumpoff, 1 
gave DeLuso manhood — the least 
I could do, and maybe the most. De- 
Luso himself would have to take 
it from there. 

Then READY amber turned to 
red TRANSMIT, and the soft gong 
began pealing the seconds from one 
to ten — in the very special note 
that triggers a deeply keyed response 
in every Starpather’s brain. My eyes 
closed, and I began to trance out. A 
deep hum rolled through my body, 
rising from thunder to a siren shriek. 
Through some far, dimly wakeful 
sense, I heard a faint cry from 
DeLuso. Then I exploded .... 

T here’s always that tiny jolt, like 
a hundred billion little cubes 
of ivory clamping together at once. 
Ask any Starpather about that jolt. 
He’ll tell you it’s the sweetest sound 
in the world. 

You see, it isn’t a stack of cubes 
at all, friend — it’s you. And if you 
can feel that jolt it means your 
body is back in one piece again, and 
you’ve made it through Starpath. 

The first thing I did was look 
at DeLuso — fast. He was there, 
his eyes flickering open, breath 
steady. I pushed myself up, and the 
cushions petaled wide to let me 
through. DeLuso turned then and 
looked at me. 

“Congratulations,” I said dryly. 
“For some reason, Cadet, it ap- 
pears you’ve made it through Star- 
path.” ■' 

DeLuso was a light shade of class- 
room chalk, but he managed a grin. 
“Thank you, sir. It’s — a lot differ- 
ent than I expected.” 



I shot his sick grin right back at! 
him. “Oh? Really, Cadet? Well, it's 
also a lot different than I expected , 
Misterr 

DeLuso stared. I jerked cover- 
alls and slipons from the locker and 
glared at him. “You made a noise, 
Cadet. Did you know that? No, you 
didn’t hear it, but I did. You made 
a noise during transmit! Your relax- 
ation cycle was imperfect. Some- 
thing tensed, probably a muscle in 
the lower throat, and a little breath 
of air you weren’t supposed to have 
in the first place moved over that 
muscle causing vibration, motion, 
sound. Our, as we call it in Star- 
path, Cadet — good old Instant 
Death. Evidently you stopped in 
time. You are here — and that pret- 
ty well proves it, doesn’t it? Now, 
next question: How many times do 
you think you can get away with a 
damn fool stunt like that?” 

I glanced at the tiny station chro- 
nometer set in the curved wall of 
the shell. “You have twenty-one 
minutes, forty-two seconds, standard 
time, to work out that little prob- 
lem. I suggest you have it solved 
on schedule, or you won’t have to 
worry about getting chewed out at 
the next station. Any questions?” 

Apprehension had started across 
his face, but it faded quickly. “No, 
sir,” he said smartly. “No ques- 
tions, sir.” Good man. 

I tossed him coveralls and slipons. 
“Get dressed, Cadet. Let’s see what’s 
going on outside.” 

We left the dome and stepped 
out pn the plastic circle under the 
dim moon of Arcturus Seven, better 
known to the colonists there as Gell- 



52 



IF 




hell. We were 33 light-years from 
Earth as the crow flies — micro- 
seconds by Starpath. The Frostrees 
beyond the settlement clearing were 
halfway through their screaming 
lunch, tearing each other apart and 
flinging bloody foilage to the pink 
sky. The ragged, scab-covered col- 
onists stood just beyond the dome’s 
field, pelting us with filth. Several 
of them dropped dead and began 
to decompose as we watched. 

Cadet Matt DeLuso didn’t say a 
thing. I was beginning to think he 
migjht actually make Starpath. 

“Okay,” I told him, “you’ve 
caught the scenery. Go get the car- 
go — we only have 18 more minutes 
here.” 

DeLuso retreated to the dome 
and lugged out the 3x5 flat alum- 
inoid carton. I opened it near the 
edge of the field, checked it quickly, 
released the inner seal and closed it 
up again. They saw what we had, 
and for a brief minute they even 
forgot about throwing stuff at us. 
A low moan swept over the crowd. 

I looked them over. One guy 
was a little taller than the rest. He 
was skin and bones like everyone 
else, but a trifle less scabby. 

“You,” I pointed, “would you 
come to the edge of the field, 
please?” He' dragged himself over 
on shaky legs and stopped a yard 
away. He stared at men through 
rheumy eyes, then spat at my face. 
The spittle hit the field and rolled 
away. 

“You’re a little late , Starpather,” 
he croaked. His mouth curled up 
in hate, and I thought for a second 
he might spit again. 



“I’m sorry. We do what we can. 
How many have you lost?” 

He laughed, and that just about 
ended the conversation right there. 
“You want this morning’s count, or 
up to the last three minutes? We 
started with 900 people here, mister. 
We got about 200 left.” 

“I’m sorry about that, too,” I 
told him. I picked up the case and 
tossed it through the field*. It landed 
in the soft turf on the other side. 

Y ou always throw cargo through 
the field. You never roll it, or 
push it or shove it. The field’s about 
an inch thick, and if you happen to 
shove something a little too easy, 
or a pebble gets in the way — or 
anything — your cargo just stays 
there till Hell freezes over. Things 
that get caught in that inch don’t 
move. Once you lose momentum you 
can’t push it through, and certainly 
no one on the other side can pull 
it. Not unless you turn off the field. 
And brother, that is just what you 
don't do — ever. 

The colonists were already into 
the carton and passing out the little 
blue pills, but the tall man in front 
of me hadn’t moved. 

“Think that stuff’ll work?” he 
asked doubtfully. 

I nodded. “It should. They work- 
ed on the sample culture you fur- 
nished. No reason it shouldn’t do the 
job.” 

“Uh-huh. But you don’t really 
know, do you?” he said dully. I 
could tell the poor guy was dead 
on his feet. In his condition he 
shouldn’t have even been standing 
up. He made no move to get his 



STARPATH 



53 




share of the pills. I had an idea 
he just really didn’t care any more. 

“No,” I said quietly, “I don’t 
know for sure. I hope they do. I’d 
like to make you understand that 
we want to save as many people as 
possible on Gellhell.” 

“I’ll bet you do,” he said dark- 
ly. “I’ll bet you stay awake nights 
thinking about Gellhell. I'll bet you 
can hardly take a drink of good 
Earth whiskey or pull a Fungirl into 
the sack you’re so . worried . 
about . ” 

I turned away from him. His 
eyes were clouding up, and he was 
shaking all over. “DeLuso! Over 
here!” 

He came up quickly. “We have 
about 6 minutes, Cadet. Get in there 
and run through Operational prep. 
I’ll be with you in three and a half 
minutes.” 

DeLuso stared. “Operational? Sir, 
you want me to activate?” 

I watched him a moment. Right 
now he could use a bit of fatherly 
encouragement, a little friendly ser- 
vice cajolery. To hell with that. He 
also needed to learn to follow or- 
ders without a moment’s hesitation. 

“Cadet, you received an order.” 
I let the hard freeze travel from 
my eyes to his. He swallowed hard. 
But again control returned quickly. 
He snapped off a perfect salute and 
disappeared jnto the dome. I turned 
back to my scarecrow colonist. 

He was exactly where I had left 
him, and he made no motion toward 
the antiplague drugs. 

“About your Frostrees,” I said, 
“we can’t help you destroy them 
— and we don’t advise you to try, 



either. The lab boys discovered 
they’re a part of your ecological 
setup, and you can’t spare them.” 

“ the ecological setup, 

Mister!” The rage was back in his 
sunken eyes. “These things are kill- 
ing our crops as fast as we can 
grow ’em. We don’t hardly have 
the strength to burn ’em back!” 

I nodded. “There’s something in 
the carton for that. Tiger wheat. It 
worked pretty well on Ogirra. They 
had a problem very similar to yours.” 
His temper dropped a' few de- 
grees, but his eyes narrowed suspi- 
ciously. “What you figure some- 
thing called Tiger wheat’ll do to 
people, mister? Or did you think 
of that?” 

“Shouldn’t do anything,” I told 
him. “Unless you’re part plant. It 
should poison the Frostrees or any- 
thing else that tries to grow near it. 
Won’t bother people. Just stay away 
from it until after it loses its 
strength at harvest time. It’s all in 
the microbook in the seed pack.” 

He glared at me and shook his 
fists tight against his sides. “We 
don’t want any part of the stuff,” 
he hissed. “We’ll make out ourselves 
somehow. Without Starpath hand- 
outs!” 

The gong sounded softly behind 
us. I said, “You might change your 
mind when you get back on your 
feet. I hope so. Good-by — and 
the best of luck.” 

He tried to mouth a curse, then 
dropped on his thin knees to the 
ground. I jumped through the hatch 
and let the seal sigh behind me. 
I was in the cushion as OPERA- 
TIONAL green turned to amber.

DeLuso’s eyes were welded to the 
bright, blinking READY. 

“Everytiiiiig operational, sir.” 

I gave him a curt, military-type 
nod, then added: “Watch the throat 
muscles; I might see you next 
stop . 

II 

D eLuso gasped as we stepped out 
of the dome. It was night, and 
Vara Vara’s purple moon filled half 
the sky, spotting the landscape with 
soft, violet shadows. A slight breeze 
carried the odors of exotic blossoms 
and dusty pollen. 

DeLuso said something, softly, 
but I didn’t catch his words. Still, 
I understood. Vara Vara is that kind 
of world. 

“Makes you feel kind of guilty,” 
he said absently. “I mean, sir — 
after Gellhell — the things they 
have to go through just to stay 
alive.” 

I grinned in the darkness. “Uh- 
huh. Seems that way, doesn’t it? You 
know anything about Vara Vara, 
son?” 

He turned, and I picked up his 
face in the violet shadows. 

“It’s Paradise, DeLuso. At least, 
if there’s a * paradise anywhere i n 
this Universe, Vara Vara comes 
closest to filling the bill. It’s rather 
old, for a colony. Discovered near- 
ly 150 years before Starpath. Long- 
sleep colonists — some of the few 
on record that ever landed anywhere 
in those days. They took one look 
at Vara Vara, and decided this was 
it. So they mutated — and made 
Vara Vara theirs.” 



I could feel the boy’s surprise. 
Somewhere a night bird broke into 
its trilling cry. “Sir — mutated? 
But — r ” 

I nodded. ’’Mutation equipment 
was standard on every colony ship 
those days just in case. Then as now, 
it’s pretty hard to turn back. This 
was one of those cases. They thought 
it was worthwhile, and I* can’t say 
that I blame them. As to why they 
made the change, the answer is down 
there.” 

I walked to the edge of the field 
and pointed into purple darkness. 

“Below, Cadet. We’re in the top 
of a planet-wide forest, three miles 
high. Up here is where the colonists 
live. This is the paradise part of 
Vara Vara. Two miles down is the 
hell.” 

I walked back to the dome and 
turned up outside volume as high 
as it would go, aiming the directional 
pickups straight down. DeLuso 
hadn’t moved. 

“Now,” I said. “Listen.” 

There was really very little to hear 
at this distance, but it was enough 
to stand a man’s hair on end. Tt 
wasn’t so much what you could 
hear. , 

I looked at the cadet. He was 
a purple statue with a marble-white 
face. I turned the volume back to 
low. 

“Don’t ask what’s making those 
noises,” I said. “You wouldn’t be- 
lieve me if I told you. Anyway, 
the Vara Varans don’t mind. Need- 
less to say, they don’t wander around 
down there.” 

I stopped, and faced DeLuso. His 
eyes were turned to the leafy dark- 



STARPATH

ness. I knew what he was doing; 
he was trying to pinpoint the soft, 
velvety hum that had suddenly fill- 
ed the night. I smiled to myself, re- 
membering the night that almost 
alien sound had first reached my 
own ears. 

“There,” I said, “Look.” I raised 
a hand toward the dim purple moon. 
A bright ball of cold fire was 
pulsing toward us through black 
leaves. The soft hum turned to a 
definite, whirring beat. Then the 
fluttering of wings filled the night. 
A blur of violet flowed across the 
surface of the field, then settled 
lightly on a loop of twisted vine. 
DeLuso’s eyes widened. 

“Hello, Lyrerae,” I said. 

“Hell ooooooooooooo, Keith Wal- 
dermann, my Starpather!” Her 
voice was a high, golden song. She 
touched the coldlight bug nestling 
on her shoulder, and it purred into 
dimness. 

A ll of the women of Vara Vara 
are beautiful, each in their 
own way. The expression of beauty 
is a part of the Vara Vara way of 
living. None of the others — to me 
— can touch the beauty of Lyrerae. 

She smiled, glanced at me warm- 
ly, then turned her eyes search ing- 
ly on DeLuso. 

“And this one, Keith? I have not 
seen him with you before?” Lyre- 
rae’s* voice made her simple state- 
ment sound like a declaration of 
love. 

“Lyrerae. This is Cadet Matt De- 
Luso. This is his first trip, but 
we may be able to make a Star- 
pather out of him.” 



“I’m — pleased to meet you,” 
Matt mumbled. 

Lyrerae laughed. “He’s pretty, but 
not as pretty as you, Keith.” 

“Of course not,” I said serious- 
ly, “he’s just a cadet. Maybe when 
he’s an old Starpather, he’ll be as 
pretty as I am’. And what can we 
do for you, Lyrerae? Any prob- 
lems?” 

A light breeze ruffled the soft 
surface of her wings, an$l she made 
quick adjustments of balance. 
“There are no problems on Vara 
Vara, Keith. We left our problems 
behind many years ago. But,” she 
said brightly, “I am going to find 
a problem for you, Keith. I promise. 
I think you will stop coming if I 
cannot find a problem. Yes?” 

“No,” I grinned, “I won’t stop 
coming, Lyrerae.” 

“I know,” she laughed. “I know! 
And you, Matt DeLuso? You will 
come back, too?” 

“I’d like that,” said Matt. “Very 
much.” 

Lyerae winked at him and stretch- 
ed high on her long legs, spreading 
slim arms and delicate wings. The 
light down that covered her body 
fluttered briefly, then flattened 
slowly into place. It was something 
to see. It was simply WOMAN, 
spelled in capital letters. 

“I said, “Be nice to the custo- 
mers, Cadet. Smile or something.” 
DeLuso wasn’t listening. His gaze 
was lost in golden eyes, and Lyrerae 
had made another conquest. 

Then she left us with a high, 
singsong laugh and rose out of sight 
beyond violet shadows. 

I touched DeLuso’s arm. “Okay, 



56 



IF 




son, come on. We’ve got calls to 
make.” 

He blinked hard and brought his 
eyes back from the purple moon. 
“Sorry, sir, I — ” 

I turned him around and grinned. 
“Don’t be, Cadet. You get used to 
a lot of things on Starpath. You 
never get used to Vara Vara. Now, 
let’s get hopping.” 

W e had time for two more. 

Gresticbor was a dawn world 
full of scaly beasties, but nothing the 
well established colony there couldn’t 
handle. Then Styrxx, a mining plan- 
et dug in half a mile under a white 
sun we’d never see. They had a 
nice revolution brewing there, and 
both sides wanted arms from Star- 
path to, as they put it, “guarantee 
law and order.” Arms, of course, 
they didn’t get. Starpath figures talk 
is cheaper than arms and certainly 
a lot less lethal in the long run. So 
talk I gave them. 

Styrxx is very heavy on rare 
earths, and they’re almost ready to 
afford the luxury of a two-way 
Starpath terminal. I let them know 
that the paperwork on two-ways for 
a world without a stable government 
had a way of getting shuffled 
around a bit. They got the general 
idea, but I Was glad we had a nice, 
firm field around us. Mining isn’t 
entirely automated out there yet, 
and some of those guys looked ready 
and able to take a couple of Star- 
paithers apart. Field or no field. 

We’d hit four worlds in a little 
under 3 hours. Travel time: Zero 
Plus. Light-years: say, five hundred, 
five forty. Then suddenly the sched- 



ule was broken for us, and we were 
shuttled off the circuit and into 
stasis at Primera. 

I caught DeLuso’s puzzlement as 
we stepped out into the busy sta- 
tion at Primera Starpath Control. I 
let it go for the moment. There was 
nothing I could really tell him — 
not yet. Anyway, I didn’t feel much 
like talking. 

Breaking schedule is part of the 
game, but it always pulls that perm- 
anent knot in your stomach a little 
tighter. You know that each time 
you make a schedule, chances are 
good that other stomachs are hav- 
ing fits so your particular emergen- 
cy can be smoothed over. 

It isn’t easy. And we never get 
used to it, in spite of what we tell 
ourselves: that someone else needs 
shuttle time more than we do. That 
they’ll be waiting on the sidelines 
for you to finish up next time 
around. It doesn’t work that way. 
Those are your worlds out there, 
and some of them are in big trou- 
ble. Some of them might not make 
it if you miss your next call. Some 
of them are so critical you should 
try to get scheduled for a call every 
month or so. But you know it might 
be a year — or two years — and 
you wonder what’s happening out 
there. 

But there just isn’t enough power 
to keep all the circuits open. There 
just aren’t enough men who can 
ride the Starpaths. Not yet. 

Ill 

B y the book, Primera goes down 
as a Class-A world. By defini- 



STARPATH 



57 




tion, that means it’s old enough and 
rich enough to have an industrial 
export-import situation, a large pop- 
ulation and a stable political setup. 
Most important, it means Primera 
qualifies as a Starpath Crossroads, 
a world where the power plants can 
handle the mainlines and shuttles 
for a Starpath sector — one of 
those unfathomable slices of the 
galactic pie. 

There are more than enough di- 
versions on Primera to keep a man 
from boredom, if you happen to be 
in the state off mind that allows you 
to enjoy them. It was, I reflected 
wryly, about half true what they 
said about members of the Corps. 
An off-duty Starpather is no damn 
good to anyone. It’s a pretty fair 
appraisal. The men who qualify for 
Starpath duty are not men who 



easily shrug off the burden of the 
worlds that depend on them. It 
isn’t a responsibility you cast aside 
one day and pick up the next. 

There’s really no such thing as 
a Starpather on leave. 

I guess I’m a little dense. We’d 
been on Primera two days before 
I figured out what was wrong with 
DeLuso. The standards I easily and 
natuarlly applied to myself could 
mean little to him. I had an idea 
he’d make a good Starpather in 
time. Experience would take care 
of that. But for now, he was a fresh, 
raw cadet who had been Earthbound 
all his life until 48 hours ago. Since 
then he had crossed 500-odd light- 
years of space and walked on five 
strange worlds. Not a hell of a long 
Starpath career — but not bad for 
two days out of Earth I

IF 



As yet, I realized, Matt DeLuso 
was not overly interested in tra- 
dition. He was, normally enough, 
interested in what any healthy 
character of 20 or 21 years should 
be interested in. To put it mildly, 
he was straining at the bit to get 
at the sights of Primera — and do- 
ing his best to keep his impatience 
from an obviously ancient superior 
officer! 

As we crossed the warm, sun- 
drenched malf to the Grand Prim- 
era’s dining area, DeLuso kept his 
jaw denched and eyes straight 
ahead, stonily ignoring the open ad- 
miration of the two dark-eyed beau- 
ties tanning themselves at poolside. 
Seated at our table, he gave the 
oversized menu the same degree of 
concentration I’d expect from an 
astrogator pouring over his charts. 



Even when a trio of silvermasked 
Fungirls brushed by, tall, statuesque 
creatures who moved with unworld- 
ly grace, DeLuso merely clutched 
his menu tighter. 

So I know when I’m beaten. 

“DeLuso!” 

The menu dropped, and my cadet 
jerked into a full sitting brace. 
“Sir!” 

“All right. Take it easy,” I said. 
“We might as well get it over with, 
Cadet. It’s either you or me, and 1 
figure you win the deal hands 
down.” DeLuso managed to main- 
tain innocent bewilderment. 

I let out a deep breath. “Come 
off it, Mister. You’ve got dancing 
girls and nightclubs written on your 
eyeballs. Order something for me 
and hang on a little longer. I’ye get 
a couple of calls to make.”

DeLuso brightened slightly. But 
I’ve been around long enough to 
catdh those not so subtle hints of 

— what? Disbelief? Doubt? I stood 
up, leaned my hands on the table, 
and stared down at him with my 
best parade ground scowl. 

“Son, you really think I’m too 
palsied to make it to the phone by 
myself — or find a number when I 
get there?” 

DeLuco paled. “Oh, no, sir!” 
“Fine. In that case, Cadet — ” 
“Keith, all your numbers are dod- 
dering grandmothers by now. I know 

— you stole about half of them 
from my book!” 

I jerked around to face the deep 
voice behind me and looked up 
into a leather face slit by a broad 
smile. “Walt! Walt, for the — !” 
We were pumping hands and slap- 
ping backs, and DeLuso was stand- 
ing at stiff attention across the ta- 
ble. 

“They told me at Command you 
were out on shuttle. I dropped by 
as soon as we were scheduled off.” 
The tall man winced. “I know. 
Took my adjutant half a day to 
get the office girls back in harness. 
I had an idea Keith Waldermann 
was in town.” 

I grinned. Good old Walt. “Sir,” 
I said gravely, “you have just saved 
an old Starpather’s creaking image. 
Oh, Sector Commander Martin, 
meeb Cadet Matt DeLuso.” 

Martin grabbed Matt’s hand, siz- 
ing up the cadet in that rapid and 
remarkably accurate manner that 
amazed everyone who had ever 
worked with him. It was the kind 



of ability you’d expect in a Star- 
path Commander — but it was 
certainly no less remarkable for that. 

“Glad to have you aboard,” said 
Walt. “Been with us very long, 
Cadet?” 

“Two days, sir,” Matt said. “I’m 
kind of a newcomer, sir.” 

“What he didn’t mention,” I told 
Walt, “is that he made his first and 
fifth jump during that period. Which 
is a little rough, Cadet,” I grinned. 
“Didn’t tell you that before. Afraid 
it might go to your head.” 

Matt reddened suddenly, and Walt 
smiled. At the same time, the sector 
commander’s brow raised, and he 
exchanged a quick glance with me, 
obviously impressed. 

“It looks as if you may have a 
Starpather on your hands, Major,” 
he said evenly. Walt gave DeLuso 
another searching look as he spoke, 
and the tone of his voice changed 
slightly. Matt didn’t catch it, cer- 
tainly. But I’d known Walt Martin 
a long time. 

He said, “I think a man’s fifth 
jump calls for a drink from his sec- 
tor commander. I, ah, will also in- 
clude a lunch on the deal, since the 
chits will find their way to my office 
eventually, anyway. Might as well 
make sure they’re honest. And 
Cadet.” He turned to DeLuso. “If 
you think an even older Starpather 
might be able to come up with a 
few decent numbers, I suggest you 
get yourself fitted with some dress 
greens this afternoon. Now if we 
can be seated, gentlemen, I think 
we might be able to make a small 
but significant dent in the Starpath 
budget. ...”

glory boys, the danger corps, the 
top rung on the ladder. Sometimes 
they respect us, because they know 
what kind of a job we’re doing. But 
nobody loves us. I guess that’s real- 
ly asking a little too much. 

Phimera City is big — class con- 
scious, wealthy, sophisticated. It’s a 
city full of old money, the kind 
that’s hard to shake up and difficult 
to impress. 

There is one thing, though, that’s 
guaranteed to do the job: three 
Starpathers in full dress uniform, 
plus a trio of the best-fooking girls 
in town. 

We took the full tour. Matt De- 
Luso’s eyes seemed to grow wider 
at every stop. We made several of 
the most popular spots in town 
and ended up at a place accurate- 
ly described at the best steak house 
in the known universe. And every- 
where, of course, we were the cen- 
ter of attention. If you’re a Star- 
pather, you’re supposed to get used 
to that. 

Me, I never do. I don’t think 
many of us do. 

You see, it’s not quite the same 
as being a planet-wide, stereo star, 
or a high, government official. It’s 
not like that at all. A better analogy 
would be the attitude most people 
have toward their police force: nec- 
essary, maybe, but not overly wel- 
come — until you need them. 

Take the analogy a bit further, and 
you have the general feeling to- 
ward Starpathers. We’re the highest 
paid, most privileged cops in his- 
tory. We go places no one else 



is allowed to go, see things not 
one in a million will see in their 
lifetimes. We patrol the known seg- 
ments of the galaxy — that small 
arm of stars lost on the edge of 
the Milky Way’s rim. 

It’s dangerous, sure. Not too many 
of the people who complain about 
our so-called status would 'trade 
places with us for a day, But who 
thinks of that part of the job when 
they see a cop out spending the 
taxpayers’ money? 

M att DeLuso seemed to find a 
a great deal to consider on the 
black surface of his morning coffee. 
\ had an idea his silence wasn’t en- 
tirely due to the effects of wine, 
women and song. I thought — and 
I was right — that he had managed 
to glimpse a few of the negative 
aspects of Starpath service. 

“You’d have to be pretty dense 
not to see it, wouldn’t you, sir?” 

I knew what he meant, but I ask- 
ed, anyway. “You’ve discovered that 
we’re liked — but not well liked. 
Right, Cadet?” 

DeLuso nodded. “We heard about 
it in school. You know the way 
things filter down, sir. But that 
was just talk. When you see it out 
here — the way they look at 
you. ...” 

I smiled to myself and poured a 
fresh round of coffee. “There’s 
something else, too,” I told him. 
“Another factor. You don’t get so 
much resentment when you are 
where people have everything — 
and that’s the situation back home. 
Old Mother Earth is riding high — 
has been for a long, long time. Why 



STAR PATH 



61 




fed bad about Starpath? No, Cadet, 
the formula works this way: a Star- 
pather is loved in direct proportion 
to the current amount of comfort 
available on Homeworld ‘X*. Prim- 
era tolerates us; Gellhell hates us. 
You’ve seen both worlds, and it’s 
not too difficult to follow their 
reasoning. Look at it this way. At 
about 20 times light speed which is 
the best we can manage so far, a 
Longsleeper still takes 20 years to 
cover the distance out to Deneb. 
Subjectively the colonists haven’t 
missed a thing. They haven’t aged; 
that 20 years was spent in blissful 
sleep. 

“Deneb wasn’t bad — they found 
two good worlds there — but they’re 
still a long way from home. It’ll be 
several generations before they can 
begin to tame their worlds to the 
point where minimum technology 
begins. But they do have one thing. 
They have us. Within a few weeks 
they have their Starpath receiving 
station open. We get the signal and 
drop in to say hello. One more link 
in the chain is complete. 

“Naturally, these people are pret- 
ty happy to see us at first. We 
just left home, seconds ago. We 
have all the latest news for the 
past 20 years. So we say hello. 
Then 

“Then,” DeLuso finished for me, 
“we seal up the works and say 
good-by. Yes sir. I get the idea.” 

“So do they, very quickly. The 
thrill of pioneering wears off as 
soon as the supplies run out. Soon 
they need things. Maybe they need 
things badly, like Gellhell. We do 
what we can, but we can’t do every- 



thing. Most of the time we stand 
behind our force field and give 
friendly advice. But we don’t take 
passengers, and we don’t bring in 
supplies. We don’t, because it’s 
economically impossible. It costs a 
small fortune to break up the mass 
of two men and assemble them at the 
other end of Starpath. The load of 
necessities for just one worid would 
bankrupt the whole spiral arm! 

“The colonists know this,” I said, 
“but it isn’t much comfort when 
you need help in the worst way. We 
have the stuff — but we can’t give 
it to them. And it looks as if we’re 
still a long way from pushing heavy 
cargo through Starpath. That leaves 
us in kind of a touchy position. 
Until a world has time to develop 
its own power — like Primera — 
we can’t even set up a Starpath 
transmitting station. We just run 
through on the circuit and drop 
off 10 or 15 pounds of whatever 
will do the most good at the time.” 

“Sir,” asked DeLuso, “did you 
ever read about the early 19th- and 
20th-century railroads on Barth? 
They laid track across the country, 
but they couldn’t afford to stop at 
every station along the line. Only the 
economically important areas had 
anything like real two-way travel. 
Starpath is about in the same posi- 
tion now.” 

I shook my head. “Worse, Cadet. 
Remember, those trains could stop 
and let off cargo and people, or 
take something out. We can’t. Even 
the richest worlds still have to send 
anything out the hard way — 
through every long mile of space. 
Starpath is a link between the 



62 



IF 




worlds. A valuable link, certainly. 
But for now that’s all it is. We’ve 
been in space a little over 300 
years, but we haven’t always had the 
advantage of even 20 times light 
speed. Space travel has been a slow, 
hard pull. And Starpath’s even 
younger — less than a hundred 
years. We’re just getting our feet 
wet, Cadet! We have a long way 
to go.” 

IV 

T here were two more days. Matt 
DeLuso spent them with the 
girl he had met on our big night 
out. I spent mine alone, and didn’t 
regret it at all. They were quiet, 
good days, with the balmy sun of 
Primera following me over bright 
beaches and through shaded parks. 

For the first time since I can 
remember, I managed to put Star- 
path in a small compartment some- 
where and let the old nerves un- 
wind. It was still there, of course. 
It never goes away. But there was 
something else there, too. It was 
almost as if some part of me had 
an idea it might be a good thing 
to store up visions of green grass 
and wet mornings and red sun- 
sets over gray mountains. I remem- 
ber every minute of those 48 hours, 
and I hang onto them. They sav 
it takes a good three to five years 
to grow a new pair of eyes, even if 
the first ones work out. So I need 

pictures of those two good days 

I was half awake on pink sand 
when the shadow of the Starpath 
floater dropped over me and shut 
out the sun. A port opened be- 



fore the gear touched sand, and I 
took one quick look at the young 
pilot’s face. Just one. Then I grab- 
bed my gear and sprinted the few 
yards to the ship and pulled myself 
in. The boy wouldn’t look at me; 
his face was a sick ash-gray, and 
his eyes were somewhere else. I 
laid a hand on his shoulder and 
turned him around. 

“Okay, son, take it easy. Now. Is 
this what I think it is?” 

He nodded dumbly, trying hard 
to work his mouth over the words. 
“Sir . it’s Priority Red.” 

1 didn’t say anything. Like the 
boy, I knew there was nothing to 
say. I didn’t believe it any more 
than he did. You just don’t believe 
there’ll ever be a Priority Red .... 

T he ship screamed down and 
jerked against the roof of Star- 
path Control. It only took me half 
a minute to reach the staging room, 
but I knew it was true long 'before 
then. I could feel it — the unbe- 
lievable surge of power pouring 
into Control from all over the plan- 
et. There’d be no private or indus- 
trial power left on Primera now. It 
was all channeling into this one 
building, down into the giant gener- 
ators beneath Control and out to 
some flyspeck world that had bought 
itself the big package of trouble. 

We were draining a planet to 
feed raw power to a distant star. 
The same thing would 'be happen- 
ing on a dozen other Starpath Con- 
trol worlds. Electric transport 
would halt; atomic plants would 
scream as hot power was torn from 
their vitals. If you needed power 



STARPATH

to live — you’d die. Whatever prob- 
lem you had, Priority Red was big- 
ger. 

r “Keith! Over here!” I jerked 
around, vaulted a power truck haul- 
ing an ugly, snouted weapon and 
faced Walt Martin. He grasped my 
hand and signaled to a nearby cap- 
tain. The captain nodded and sprint- 
ed away. 

“Pm glad you’re here, Keith,” 
Walt said softly. “We’re going to 
need everyone who’s had over fif- 
teen minutes of Starpath exper- 
ience!” 

“It’s true. then. It finally hap- 
pened.” 

Walt nodded grimly. “It’s true, 
and it’s bad.” He turned to the high- 
vaulted chamber of the staging 
room. It was chaos, unless you 
knew what was going on there. 
Every bank of Starpath conveyors 
was in use. As men stepped from 
their missions on a hundred worlds, 
they were handed a combat suit 
and shuffled into line. Weapons, 
trucks hummed back and forth like 
blind beetles through the auxiliary 
tunnels. And everything, men and 
equipment, tunneled eventually to- 
ward one particular Starpath por- 
tal. 

“Where is it, Walt? Where did 
they hit?” The. sector commander’s 
face was gray and drawn. He had 
aged ten years in half an hour. 

“I said it was bad, Keith. It’s 
worfce than that. It’s Corphyrion.” 

I took a deep breath and held it. 
“Yeah. It would be. Damn , Walt! 
We’ll never hold it! It’s too far!” 

“We’ll hold it,” said Walt. “We’ll 
hold it because we have to hold it.” 



And he was right, of course. If 
we didn’t hold Corphyrion, we’d lose 
more than Starpath. Starpath first, 
but then the whole spiral arm. 

The captain pulled up to us then 
and handed me a set of combats. 
Behind him sprinted Matt DeLuso, 
half in and half out of his fight- 
ing gear. 

“Major!” he said and started a 
salute in my direction. Then he 
saw Walt beside me and turned the 
gesture to him. “Commander Mar- 
tin! Sir, I — ” 

I said, “Okay, hold it, Cadet. 
This is a Priority Red, son. .1 don’r 
have time to tell you what that 
means. Neither does the Command- 
er. Get yourself to supply and 
draw a weapon. Pull one for me 
while you’re at it. There won’t be 
a briefing on this one. Matt — 
just stick close and come out shoot- 
ing.” 

Matt stared. “Shooting? Sir, shoot- 
ing at what?” 

I looked at him, then at Walt. 
Walt smiled grimly. “Cadet, we 
haven’t the faintest idea. But I 
think we’ll know what to shoot at 
when we see it.” 

I didn’t have the slightest doubt 
about that. 

W alt and I transmitted together, 
on the second wave. DeLuso 
and Captain Hamiel, Commander 
Martin’s captain-aide, came right be- 
hind us. 

It was a pure, textbook hell. There 
were about forty men already 
crowded outside the dome, behind 
the bubble of our force field. There 
was no room to do anything. Every- 



64 



IF 




one was on top of someone else. Be- 
side me, a heavy- weapons sergeant 
cursed under his breath as a com- 
bat foot came down on his gaunt- 
let hand. He was trying to assemble 
a bulky disruptor that had of ne- 
cessity been transmitted in four sec- 
tions. 

Raw, unimaginable power was 
surging in from Starpath worlds to 
supplement and reinforce the dome’s 
generators. The field’s protective 
bubble was expanding to make room 
for our forces — but not fast 
enough. The dome’s air condition- 
ing wasn’t built to handle this kind 
of thing. On top of that, whatever 
was outside our field was letting us 
have it with some pretty awesome 
stuff. Energy washed over the field, 
turning it faintly red, and we were 
getting plenty of heat from that 
alone. 

A hand tapped my shoulder, and 
I faced Commander Martin. He mo- 
tioned me to the far side of the 
dome where a harried group of 
technicians were laboring over a 
small, glowing screen. 

“Their weapons output makes it 
damn near impossible to pin down 
any positions,” he growled. “But 
we think we have something” He 
pointed. “There. Those three blips 
keep turning uprin spite of the stat- 
ic. We have three disruptors as- 
sembled. I can’t afford to wait for 
more. We can’t take much more of 
this pounding, Major — get this 
stuff in line and try to knock out 
those positions!” 

I pulled Captain Hamiel, along 
with me and sent Cadet DeLuso 
back to key in the cables from ra- 



dar to our bank of disruptors. Sweat 
burned into my eyes under the 
heavy combat armor. I glanced up 
once and saw a deep circle of 
chenyred pouring across the side 
of our field. 

Suddenly the sweat under my 
helmet turned to ice. We were deal- 
ing with some smart cookies. They^ 
hadn’t been able to penetrate out 
force field with their mass fire- 
power — so they were turning every- 
thing they had on one spot. That 
spot was absorbing a hell of a lot 
of energy — and holding. For how 
long? 

I didn’t want to think too much 
about that. 

DeLuso sprinted up and signaled 
me the cables were keyed. I turned. 
Two Starpathers were gingerly low- 
ering the deadly disruptor tubes 
and extracting the shiny safety keys. 

“Ready, Major,” said Hamiel. 
“I’ve set it up for one blast over 
each of the three targets. I think, 
sir, if we hit them while they’re still 
concentrating fire on one area — ” 

I nodded quickly, cutting him off, 
and glanced once more at the deep, 
red scar spreading across our field. 

I wondered what the enemy — 
whoever or whatever they were — 
would 'be thinking right now. The 
more I considered that concentrated 
firepower stunt, the less I liked it. 
It was a good idea, certainly. Maybe 
I’d have done the same thing in 
their place. Still, maybe it was just 
too good an idea .... 

I turned back to Hamiel. “Cap- 
tain, change your settings. Con- 
centrate two of your weapons on 
targets one and three. Lob die other 



STARPATH 



65 




one high and slow over target two. 
I want it to fire a good two seconds 
ahead of your other weapons.” 

Hamid stared. I could see his 
eyes darting around to the side 
land behind me, probably hoping to 
find Walt looking over my shoulder. 

“Major,” he said slowly, “we 
don’t know much about their wea- 
pons, but we do know they have 
the capacity to knock off a slow- 
firing battery.” 

“That, Captain, is my thinking, 
too. It’s getting hotter than hell in 
here — please carry out the order, 
Hamiel! Now!” He turned red un- 
der his helmet, his mouth opening 
with the beginning of another pro- 
test. I moved him aside quickly. 

“DeLuso!” 

The cadet nodded, moved to the 
weapons and made rapid adjust- 
ments. He raised his hands from the 
board, and I pressed the button of 
the first disruptor, sending the sil- 
ver bolt in a high, slow arc they 
couldn’t miss. 

They didn’t. Before I’d counted 
off the two seconds, a white blast 
shook the dome, and I jammed home 
the other two buttons at once. Twin 
missiles thrummed through the field 
in a ground4uigging trajectory. A 
mile away, double cones of silent 
purple ligjit winked and died. I ran 
around the dome and glanced at 
the small screen. 

Two of the blips Were gone for 
good. A disruptor missile plays some 
pretty horrifying tricks on its tar- 
get. Every atom in the area moves 
a meter to its right and changes 
place with its neighbor. Result: 
some pretty gory scenery. 



“Major.” It was Hamiel. “Sir, 
I — ” 

“Forget it, Captain. We don’t 
have time for a bloody court martial 
— those characters aren’t licked 
yet!” In answer, a flood of red 
splashed over the dome. I grinned 
anyway — their concentration was 
a lot weaker than before. 

W e fed bolts into our three dis- 
ruptors as fast as they could 
fire. Some of them got through — 
and a lot of them didn’t. 

We weren’t fooled by the enemy’s 
strength any more, but they had 
learned a lot about us, too. They 
were answering us from three new 
positions now. But they had spread 
their power thin. I could feel their 
concentrations weakening, and I 
could read the story in the viewer. 
Walt looked over my shoulder. I 
looked back, and he smiled grimly. 

“Okay,” he said, “let’s take ’em, 
Major.” 

It always seems to end up that 
way, doesn’t it? You can soften up 
the enemy with Che most awesome 
of weapons. Then you have to go in 
yourself and dig ’em out. 

We went. And every Starpath 
soldier that leaped through that 
force field knew there was only 
one way back. He knew that field 
couldn’t be turned off to let him 
in unless every enemy position was 
destroyed first. I did what every 
other soldier did. I tried not to 
think about it. 

There wasn’t time to worry about 
getting back. We found that out 
soon enough. I lost half a dozen 
troopers before we made the small 



66 



IF 




gully about 100 yards from the 
dome. 

I knew Walt’s group had fared a 
little better. But not much. We gave 
them everything we had — hand 
disruptor, V-grenades, small arms 
fire. We did a pretty fair job of it, 
too, because the second wave got 
through our covering fire with only 
half our casualties. 

I moved out of our gully down 
a small ridge and got my first sight 
of the enemy. A dark beak opened 
under black pinpoint eyes, and a 
stubby weapon came up fast in 
long arms. I kicked in the green- 
tinted faceplate and kept going. A 
trooper in front of me turned with 
half a face and dropped under my 
feet. We stormed the first position 
and fried a good fifty of them. They 
died silently, great horny beaks 
straining for whatever poison they 
breathed back home. 

I turned, then, to take a quick 
count of my men. My stomach sank, 
and a bad taste welled up in my 
throat. There were three of them 
left: Matt DeLuso and two veteran 
Starpath troopers. 

I looked at Matt. He managed a 
tight -grin. He didn’t look much like 
a raw cadet now. You couldn’t come 
through that last hundred yards 
without earning Starpath wings. 

Martin stepped into our post and 
held out a weary hand. “Well, Keith, 
we got ’em. It was a high price for 
Round One. But we did it.” 

I looked at him. “Sir?” Then I 
got it. A cold hand reached up and 
touched the hairs on the back of 
my neck. 

Of course — the ship! Somewhere, 



there was a ship that had brought 
the aliens to Corphyrion. 

Walt nodded grimly. “I’ve ordered 
a couple of small flyers, but it’ll 
take half a damn hour to get them 
through piece by piece and reas- 
sembled. Hell, Keith, this is no 
way to fight a war — sneaking back 
and forth across the galaxy through 
a mousehole!” He cursed under his 
breath and ran a glove over his 
mud-streaked faceplate. “Come on, 
let’s get these troopers back to the 
dome area — fast!” 

We almost made it . 

S uddenly a soldier in the rear 
looked up and yelled loud enough 
to bum out every receiver in the 
area. And there it was — a black, 
egg-shaped ship rising out of the 
hills not two miles away. 

We turned and sprinted for the 
dome area, but it was already too 
late. Red lights winked from the 
black ship, and troopers began to 
die. The disruptors behind our field 
opened up to cover us, but there was 
Little they could do. It was too late 
now to even think about lifting the 
field to let us in. No matter what 
happened on Corphyrion, we 
couldn’t risk losing the dome. 

So that was that. If our disrup- 
tors couldn’t stop that looming black 
egg, the enemy could scoot for 
home and come back with a thou- 
sand, a million more — before we 
could get enough power on Corph- 
rion to put down a small-sized riot. 

There were five of us — Walt, 
DeLuso, myself and two troopers. 
We all hit the dirt at once and 
hung on. We had a pitiful amount 



STARPATH 



67 




of cover — a small, dried up creek 
bed and a couple of leafless shrubs. 
All we could do was wait. And I 
didn’t figure we had too much 
longer for that. 

The alien ship dropped lower, 
then setded atop a small hill over- 
looking the dome. I cursed aloud, 
and DeLuso turned with a ques- 
tioning look. 

“They’re landing, Matt,” I said 
dryly, “because they’re a particularly 
nasty bunch of characters. They’re 
in no hurry to finish us off!” 

“They don’t have to be,” grunt- 
ed Walt. “That ship is just big 
enough to neutralize our disruptors, 
long enough to ram a beam through 
that field. Look!” 

I glanced across the gully and 
squinted at the dome. A bright red 
spot was growing on one perimeter. 

It couldn’t have been more than 
a foot wide, but it was a concentrat- 
ed circle of awful power. Theoreti- 
cally the dome’s field would hold. 
But it had never been meant to 
stand that kind of attack. 

“Major!” 

I jerked up, following DeLuso ’s 
arm. I frowned, seeing nothing. 

Then figures moved in the churn- 
ed up debris before the dome, and 
three troopers suddenly plunged 
into the open, running for a grove 
of trees to our left. They made 15 
or 20 yards, before the ship spotted 
them. I dutched Walt’s shoulder 
as red lances leaped out and cut the 
legs from under the last trooper. As 
he dropped, he tossed a long sliver 
of silver to the man beside him. 
He and his companion made it to 
the trees as angry beams of light 



cut through every leaf and branch 
above them. 

Walt and I exchanged quick looks, 
then belly-crawled our way back 
along the ditch. DeLuso and the 
troopers followed. 

We met them halfway — Captain 
Handel and a young Starpath tech- 
nician. Hamiel grinned, snapped a 
quick salute at Martin. 

“I thought you might find some 
use for a couple of these, sir. We 
also borrowed a carton of fuses.” 

I looked at Hamiel’s feet, and 1 
suddenly knew what the dying 
trooper had tossed to his buddy. 
There were three bound cannisters 
of disruptor missiles. Enough to 
send every alien on Corphyrion to 
his own particular heaven — the 
hard way. 

I grinned and pounded Hamiel 
on the back as darts of crimson 
fire searched the air over our heads. 

“Captain, the apologies are on 
me! Walt, it’ll work, if we can get 
close enough to drop this bundle 
within a hundred yards of the ship. 
There’s cover at the base of the 
hill, and they’re not likely to have 
troops out now. They’re too damn 
busy trying to get one of those 
beams through the field!” Walt 
managed a tired grin, but it was the 
old Walt again. He glanced at me, 
then at Hamiel. 

“Okay, Captain — let’s get our- 
selves a spaceship!” 

V 

I t was there, less than a hundred 
yards away, squatting like a black 
bug on the crest of the hill. We

IF 




came up from behind, away from 
the scathing red beams, but a ter- 
rible crimson aura lit the ship to 
tefli us of the awful firepower pour- 
ing over the Starpatih dome below. 

I glanced up the full, then at 
Commander Martin. Walt’s face 
was grim in the fading light. He 
slid back around the dark slab o*f 
rock to my side and shook his head. 

I understood. It wasn’t going to 
be a pushover, if it was possible at 
all. The first 75 yards weren’t too 
bad; scattered outcroppings offered 
cover, particularly after Corphyrion’s 
sun dropped lower behind the hills. 
That was the beginning — 75 

yards of possible protection. After 
that came 25 long yards of red 
death. 

That last stretch of ground was 
completely bare. There wasn’t a loose 
pebble for cover. AH we could do 
was count on the increasing dark- 
ness — and hope that aliens had 
naturally poor night vision. There 
was some consolation in the fact 
that they were likely to be concen- 
trating most of their attention on 
the dome in the opposite direction, 
but — I wasn’t personally counting 
a hell of a lot on that. I’d seen them 
fight. 

We had to lay those disruptor 
missiles right on the enemy’s door- 
step. It was obvious, now, from this 
distance. The alien ship glowed with 
a faint, blue-green aura — they had 
a screen of their own. There was 
no way to tell how strong it might 
be, but We couldn’t afford to guess. 
There was too much to lose if we 
happened to guess wrong. For all 
we knew, they had already alerted 



their home world through some 
means of c ommunic ation we knew 
nothing about. We had instant trans- 
mission — but only through Star- 
path. Another race could have al- 
ready solved the problems of hyper- 
speed radio in a totally different 
manner. It -might be too late al- 
ready .... * 

We couldn’t dwell too long on 
that. The job now was to get those 
missiles up the hill, as close to the 
ship as possible. It was enough for 
the moment. 

It happened — and none of us 
saw it. Hamiel was with us, right 
behind me, then he was gone. Then 
Walt cursed and stiffened beside me. 
I turned to see a dim figure dis- 
appear in the rocks to the right of 
the ship. Commander Martin stared 
for a quick second, then jerked 
around and plunged after his aide. 
I jumped up and wrapped my arms 
around his combat suit in a tight 
grip. 

Walt tried to shake me off, and we 
both went down to the hard ground. 

“Damn it, Major,” he raged, “get 
— your — hands — !” 

I shook my head and held fast. 
“No, sir. It’s done. Someone was 
going to have to do it. He just 
decided first.” 

Walt relaxed slightly, but his eyes 
still blazed into mine. “That wasn’t 
his decision, Keith. It was mine.” 

I nodded. “That’s why he didn’t 
wait, Walt. He got the job he want- 
ed before you decided to volunteer. 
He was right about that — wasn’t 
he?” 

Walt didn’t answer. He walked 
slowly over to the oanndsters and 



STARPATH 



69 




hooked them over his shoulder. He 
looked hack and smiled distantly. 

“Everyone else is disobeying or- 
ders today, Major. Guess I better 
take a crack at it myself.” He turn- 
ed and motioned to the nearest 
trooper. “Come on, son, let’s get 
our luggage up the hill.” 

“Walt,” I said tightly, “just a 
damn minute! That doesn’t happen 
to be your job either!” 

He turned to answer, but his 
words died as a spark of blue fire 
flashed in the darkening hills. 

I looked up. Captain Hamiel was 
framed against the sky, perched 
high atop a scarred boulder on our 
right. He was yelling at the top 
of his lungs emptying his sidearm 
at the great black egg. The bolts 
splashed harmlessly off the screen- 
ed shell, and a dark muzzle shifted 



in the middle of the alien hull and 
seared Hamid’s boulder with red 
flame. 

Hamiel dropped. For a second I 
thought he was hit; then I caught 
him again as he crabbed his way 
to another position. He fired again, 
then jerked away as another red 
beam split the landscape. 

I turned to catch Walt and his 
trooper melt into the darkness. De- 
Luso stood beside me, unmoving. I 
cursed myself silently. Three Star- 
pathers were out there now,' moving 
up on an alien ship, while I stood 
behind a damn boulder with DeLuso 
and two troopers, waiting to offer 
history’s most helpless covering fire. 

I had known it the minute we 
reached the hill. Walt had known 
it, and so had the Captain. It was 
perfectly clear. 








70 



IF 




Whoever moved up that hill 
could forget about coming back. 

I was looking right at Hamiel when 
he died. A red beam simply 
sliced him in half as he changed 
boulders. It was all over. The cap- 
tain had finished his job. 

And it worked. Walt and the 
trooper reached the last bit of cover 
without trouble. I glanced at the 
dark muzzle in the alien hull. It 
still swept the boulder’s around 
Hamiel’s body, searching the shad- 
ows for more of the enemy. 

All Walt and his trooper had to 
do was stay in the darkness — and 
wait for that one, perfect heartbeat 
when something tells you NOW! 

I strained against the growing 
night, gripping the barrel of my 
gun until steel burned into my 



glove. I guess the distance Walt and 
the Staipather must have covered, 
then silently signaled DeLuso. We 
moved off up the hill, hugging the 
dark side of the stony ridge. I 
stopped once, searching for move- 
ment ahead. 

Nothing. Only the red aura of 
deadly fire pouring into * Starpath’s 
dome, and the faint blue shimmer 
of the alien screen.. Then — 

— two shadows, silent, close to 
the ground. I strained against the 
darkness. For a quick second, I 
saw them — Walt and the trooper, 
outlined before a patch of white, 
only a few yards from the black 
hull, a few steps away. 

DeLuso shouted beside me and 
the two dazzling white flares ex- 
ploded overhead like small suns. The 
two bright figures in combat gear 




STARPATH 



71 




paused for a split second against 
tiie blinding light, then raced for 
the alien ship. 

The trooper was ahead, Walt a 
few steps behind. The deadly muz- 
zle above them cut a swift, angry 
arc out of the sky. A thin tongue 
of red fire licked across the hill 
and burned the trooper to his knees ^ 
His quick, short cry echoed through 
my receiver; then he was quiet. Walt 
ran on another ten feet before a 
beam of crimson winked against his 
helmet. 

He kept moving — a weird, aim- 
less dance before the beam found 
him again and slammed him hard 
against the ground. The thin pen- 
cil of energy stayed there, search- 
ing him out with murderous ven- 
geance, probing, cutting, slashing 
away until a billion fiery segments 
of Walt Martin blazed against the 
night. 

DeLuso and I moved as one man, 
dodging the bright lances, sprinting 
for the silver bundle of missiles 
ahead. Red fire dug at my heels, 
turning cold rock into molten pools. 
We spread, Matt to the left, me 
to the right. For a brief second, we 
were free of the deadly fire as alien 
guns shifted to cover their splitting 
targets. 

I saw it coming as if I had all 
the time in the world. A thin lance 
of fire hissing across the hill in a 
precise, slow, agonizingly perfect 
arc. I even knew exactly where and 
when my legs would intersect that 
blazing circle. I was down, clutch- 
ing dumbly at a raw, charged grove 
of black where a portion of thigh 
had been a moment before. 



There was no time for pain. 1 
crabbed awkwardly along the 
ground, ahead of the hungry lances 
that probed the landscape for the 
rest of me. 

DeLuso dodged past, and I fired 
a short and ineffectual burst over 
his head toward the dark sfbip. The 
two troopers behind us joined in. 

Matt grabbed the cannister with- 
out stopping and bolted for the ship. 
A bright beam clipped his shoulder, 
and he staggered briefly, then went 
on. I fired another burst ‘ and got 
a splash of hot liquid rock for an 
answer. It burned through a soft 
spot in my armor and lay like a 
small sun on my spine. -I screamed 
until the noise hurt my ears, then — 

“Major! Over here T 

1 turned, caught the two troopers 
a few yards to my left, behind 
a low ridge of rook. For a second 
I just stared at them, wondering 
how the hell they had made it 
through that forest of red fire. Then 
I got a good leg under me and 
moved. 

I glanced up the hill once and 
froze. My throat went suddenly dry. 
Matt was down! Gone. An ugly 
circle of fire churned the ground 
where he had been a second before. 
I cursed something to myself, turned 
away from the troopers, and started 
up the long hill. 

A trooper yelled, leaped out after 
me. I aimed a savage kick at his 
head with a leg that wasn’t fit for 
kicking. He shoved me behind cover 
as the ground turned to flame be- 
hind me. Pain hit my leg in a pulse 
of agony. I lashed out, slamming a 



72 



IF 




weak ifist at an anonymous face- 
plate. The trooper pulled hack, 
startled, his mouth moving frantical- 
ly. I was in no mood for listening. 

“Damn it!” I screamed. “A sol- 
dier’s down out there, trooper!” 

“Major, he's safe I He made itl " 

“He — what?” I sat up, pushing 
the trooper off, and raised my head 
over the ridge. An alien flame 
brightened the sky, hut I saw him. 

Red lances probed and screamed 
around our own cover, hut no beam 
could reach Cadet Matt DeLuso. 
He was flat beneath the curve of the 
alien ship, face pale in the bright 
light, the silver cannisters safe be- 
side him. 

“Come on. Matt; Get those fuses 
set r 

I gripped the barrel of my weap- 
on, wondering what was holding 
the boy up. All he had to do now 
was — 

Then I saw it, and my body went 
suddenly limp with defeat. Even 
from here you could tell that the 
fusing elements were nothing but 
masses of useless metal. Somewhere 
on the long trip up the hill they 
had been hit. 

I cursed and pounded my fist 
against oold stone. Men had died 
to get those missiles up there, in 
the shadow of the alien ship. And 
now they were nothing. Useless. 

“Oh, my God, sir. Look!” 

I caught the trooper’s tone and 
jerked around. For a moment there 
was nothing. Then I saw, and a 
pulse of grim pleasure shot a burst 
of laughter from my lips. The two 
troopers heard and returned black 
grins. 



We were licked, sure. But' now 
we had something to shoot at, some- 
thing with a blue aura of protec- 
tion. The aliens knew Matt was un- 
der there, and they knew whatever 
he had with him meant trouble. 
So they made the big mistake. They 
sent their own troopers out to get 
him. 

Fire pinned us to the ground, but 
we poured in .a wave of death at 
the enemy soldiers. Faceplates burst; 
and parrot beaks screamed for 
homework! air. We piled them up in 
charred heaps as fast as they came 
around the black ship. The trooper 
beside me dropped as a red beam 
neatly sliced the left side of his 
body from the right. Through a 
storm of crimson death I saw Matt 
DeLuso, far away, crouched be- 
neath the enemy ship. I saw him 
calmly snap the safety keys from 
his ddsruptor missiles, and I realized 
coldly — and proudly — what he 
was going to do. I added another 
trio of aliens to the burning pyre 
beside the ship, and then red fire 
crawled along the barrel of my 
weapon and plunged a million hot 
needles through my eyes .... 

VI 

r iey bought us time on Corphy- 
rion — Matt DeLuso, Hamid, 
and 17 other Starpathers who died 
there. Only one — Walt Martin — 
knew just how much we needed 
that time. 

I wish Matt DeLuso could have 
known what he was doing when he 
pulled the keys and set off his 
missiles by hand against the cold 



STARPATH

bull of an alien ship. He would 
have done it anyway, certainly. He 
didn’t need any big reasons. It was 
a job that had to be done — and 
that was enough. 

But there’s so much Matt didn’t 
know — Matt, the troopers behind 
our field at the dome, the young 
soldier who carried me through 
red hell just before Matt’s disrupt- 
ors did their job. There are some 
things we can’t talk about, even 
to that most exclusive group of 
men who make up Starpath. 

You can’t tell a man he’s a Star- 
path trooper because he’s one out 
of a billion — because his brain 
contains some rare quality that en- 
ables him to withstand that ter- 
rible twist through whatever strange 
dimensions Starpath passes. You 
can’t tell a Starpath cadet he has 
one slim chance in hell of making 
it through his initial flight — of 
waking up to stand on a new world 
and gaze at unknown stars. 

Oh, we try. We try to weed 
them out before it’s time for that 
deadly voyage through wrenching 
darkness. But — we need them — 
we need them so badly! 

And if we think they can make it 
— if we think they might make it 
we put them into a Starpath cap- 
sule and shut out the thoughts that 
come. 

When we get a Matt DeLuso, a 
man who can ride the Starpath 
lanes, we give him hell and tell 
him he’s a foul-up Cadet who’ll 
probably never make the grade. 
What can you tell him? That you 
lost a thousand others in another 
dimension, hoping for one DeLuso? 



You see, there isn't any vast, Star- 
path army out there. It doesn’t 
exist. We don’t have a cop on 
every beat to guard the alien stars. 
We don’t have anything like that 
at all. 

We have half a thousand troopers 
— five hundred men — and 3,000 
lonely worlds spread across the great 
spiral arm. Three thousand tiny, 
vulnearable worlds, and only five 
hundred men who can span the 
depths between them. That’s it. 
That’s the Starpath secret. 4 

We spread out from Earth too 
fast. We weren’t ready to fling col- 
onies across the great gulfs between 
the stars. We weren’t ready because 
our ships were too slow to spread 
a network of impregnable defenses 
over a thousand light-years. 

We weren’t ready because there 
was always the chance of Priority 
Red. 

And now it’s happened. A non- 
human intelligence. An alien intelli- 
gence that wiped out the colony on 
Corphyrion without a second thought 

Starpath has warned the other 
worlds, and the ships are sweeping 
out to the far reaches with men 
and weapons. But starships take too 
long — much, much too long to 
save a world. Only Starpath can 
be there instantaneously — when 
it happens. It’s up to Starpath to 
hold them back until we can build 
new, faster ships — ships with Star- 
path drives that can wrench an ar- 
mada through the dark dimensions 
to any point in the galaxy. 

It’ll take time, but we can do it. 

We must do it!

A RELIC 
OF THE 
EMPIRE 

They were pirates, but of a harmless , 
gentle sort. He was their victim — 
and far deadlier than they could be!

Illustrated by BURNS 




I 

W hen the ship arrived Dr. Rich- 
ard Schultz-Mann was out 
among the 'plants, flying over and 
around them on a lift belt. He hover- 
ed over one, inspecting with proprie- 
tary interest an anamolous patch in 
its yellow foliage. This one would 
soon be ripe. 

The nature lover was a bread- 
stick of a man, very tall and very 
thin, with an aristocratic head sport- 
ing a close-cropped growth of cop- 



pery hair and an asymmetric beard. 
A white streak ran above his right 
ear, and there was a patch of white 
on each side of the chin, one coin- 
ciding with the waxed spike. As his 
head moved in the double sunlight 
they changed color constantly. 

He took a tissue sample from the 
grayish patch, stored it and started 
to move on . 

The ship came down like a day- 
light meteor, streaking blue-white 
across the vague red glare of Big 
Mira. It slowed and circled high 



75 




overhead, weaving drunkenly across 
the sky, then settled toward the 
plain near Mann’s Explorer. Mann 
watched it land, then gave up his 
bumblebee activities and went to 
welcome the newcomers. He was 
amazed at the coincidence. As far 
as he knew his had been the first 
ship ever to land here. The com- 
pany would be good . but what 
could anyone possibly want here? 

Little Mira set while he was 
skimming back. A flash of white at 
the far edge of the sea, and the 
tiny blue-white dwarf was gone. 
The shadows changed abruptly, 
turning the world red. Mann took 
off his pink-tinged goggles. Big Mira 
was still high, sixty degrees above 
the horizon and two hours from sec- 
ond sunset. 

The newcomer was huge, a thick, 
blunt-nosed cylinder twenty times 
the size of the Explorer. It looked 
old. Not damaged, not even weath- 
ered, but indefinably old. Its nose 
was still closed tight, the living bub- 
ble retracted, if indeed it had a 
living bubble. Nothing moved near- 
by. They must be waiting for his 
welcome before they debarked. 

Mann dropped toward the new- 
comer. 

The stunner took him a few hun- 
dred feet up. Without pain and with- 
out sound, suddenly all Mann’s 
muscles turned* to loose jelly. Fully 
conscious and completely helpless, 
he continued to dive toward the 
ground. 

Three figures swarmed up at him 
from the newcomer’s oversized air- 
lock. They caught him before he hit. 
Tossing humorous remarks at each 



other in a language Mann did not 
know, they towed him down to the 
plain. 

T he man behind the desk wore 
a captain's hat and a cheerful 
smile. “Our supply of verinol is 
limited,” he said in the trade 
language. “If I have to use it I will, 
but I’d rather save it. You may have 
heard that it has unpleasant side ef- 
fects.” 

“I understand perfectly,” said 
Mann. “You’ll use it the moment 
you think you’ve caught me in a lie.” 
Since he had not yet been injected 
with the stuff, he decided it was a 
bluff. The man had no verinol, if 
indeed there was such an animal 
as verinol. 

But he was still in a bad hole. 
The ancient, renovated ship held 
more than a dozen men, whereas 
Mann seriously doubted if he could 
have stood up. The sonic had not 
entirely worn off. 

His captor nodded approvingly. 
He was huge and square, almost a 
cartoon of a heavy-planet man, with 
muscularity as smooth and solid as 
an elephant’s. A Jinxian, for anyone's 
money. His size made the tiny ship- 
board office seem little more than 
a coffin. Among the crew his cap- 
tain’s hat would not be needed to 
enforce orders. He looked like he 
could kick holes in hullmetal or 
teach tact to an armed kzinti. 

“You’re quick,” he said. ‘That's 
good. I'll be asking questions about 
you and about this planet. You’ll 
give truthful, complete answers. If 
some of my questions get too per- 
sonal, say so, but remember I’ll use

the verinol if I’m not satisfied. How 
old are you?” 

“One hundred and fifty-four.” 
“You look much older.” 

“I was off boosterspice for a cou- 
ple of decades.” 

‘Tough luck. Planet of origin?” 
“Wunderland.” 

“Thought so, with that stick- 
figure build. Name?” 

“Dr. Richard Harvey Schulz- 
Mann.” 

“Rich Mann, hah? Are you?” 
Trust a Jinxian to spot a pun. 
“No. After I make my reputation 
Fll write a book on the Slaver Em- 
pire. Then I’ll be rich.” 

“If you say so. Married?” 

“Several times. Not at the mo- 
ment.” 

“Rich Mann, I can’t give you my 
real name, but you can call me Cap- 
tain Kidd. What kind of beard is 
that?” 

“You’ve never seen an asymmetric 

btwd?” 

“No, thank the Mist Demons. It 
looks like you’ve shaved off all your 
hair below the part, and everything 
on your face left of what looks like 
a one-tuft goatee. Is that the way 
it’s supposed to go?” 

“Exactly so.” 

“You did, it on purpose then.” 
“Don’t mock me, Captain Kidd.” 
“Point taken. Are they popular 
on Wunderland?” 

Dr. Mann unconsciously sat a 
little straighten “Only among those 
willing to take the time and trouble 
to keep it neat.” He twisted the sin- 
gle waxed spike of beard at the left 
of his chin with unconscious com- 
placence. This was the only straight 



hair on his face, the rest of the 
beard being close cropped and curly; 
and it sprouted from one of the white 
patches. Mann was proud of his 
beard. 

“Hardly seems worth it,”: said the 
Jinxian. “I assume it’s to show you’re 
one of the leisure classes. What are 
you doing on Mira Ceti-T?” 

“I’m investigating one aspect of 
the Slaver Empire.” 

“You’re a geologist, then?” 

“No, a xenobiologist.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“What do you know about the 
Slavers?” 

“A little. They used to live all 
through this part of the galaxy. One 
day the slave races decided they’d 
had enough, and there was a war. 
When it was over everyone was 
dead.” 

“You know quite a bit. Well, Cap- 
tain, a billion and a half years is a 
long time. The Slavers left only two 
kinds of evidence of their existence. 
There are the stasis boxes and their 
contents, mostly weaponry, but rec- 
ords have been found too. And 
there are the plants and animals 
developed for the Slavers’ conveni- 
ence by their tnuctipun slaves, who 
were biological engineers.” 

“I know about those. We have 
bandersnatchi on Jinx, on both sides 
of the ocean.” 

“The bandersnatchi food animals 
are a special case. They can’t mu- 
tate; their genes are as thick as 
your finger, too large to be influ- 
enced by radiation. All other relics 
of tnuctipun engineering have mu- 
tated almost beyond recognition. Al- 
most. For the past twelve years I’ve 



A RELIC OF THE EMPIRE 



77 




been searching out and identifying 
the surviving species.” 

“It doesn’t sound like a fun way 
to spend a life, Rich Mann. Are 
there Slaver animals on this planet?” 
“Not animals, but plants. Have 
you been outside yet?” 

“Not yet.” 

“Then come out. I’ll show you.” 

II 

T he ship was very large. It did 
not seem to be furnished with 
a living balloon; hence the entire 
lifesystem must be enclosed within 
the metal walls. Mann walked ahead 
of the Jinxian down a long unpaint- 
ed corridor to the airlock, waited 
inside while the pressure dropped 
slightly, then rode the escalator to 
ground. He would not try to escape 
yet, though the sonic had worn off. 
The Jinxian was affable but alert. He 
carried a flashlight-laser dangling 
from his belt, his men all arouhd 
them, and Mann’s lift belt had been 
removed. Richard Mann was not 
quixotic. 

It was a red, red world. They 
stood on a dusty plain sparsely scat- 
tered with strange yellow-headed 
bushes. A breeze blew things like 
tumbleweeds across the plain, things 
which on second glance were the 
dried heads of former bushes. No 
other life-forms were visible. Big 
Mira sat on the horizon, a vague 
fiery semicircular cloud, just dim 
enough to look at without squint- 
ing. Outlined in sharp black sil- 
houette against the red giant’s bloody 
disk were three slender, improbably 
tall spires, unnaturally straight and 




regular, each with a vivid patch of 
yellow vegetation surrounding its 
base. Members of the Jinxian’s crew 
ran, walked or floated outside, some 
playing an improvised variant of 
baseball, others at work, still others 
merely enjoying themselves. None 
were Jinxian, and none had Mann’s 
light-planet build. Mann noticed 
that a few were using the thin wire 
blades of variable-knives to cut down 
some of the straight bushes. 
“Those,” he said. 

“The bushes?” 

“Yes. They used to be tnuctip 
stage trees. We don’t know what 
they looked like originally, but the 
old records say the Slavers stopped 
using them some decades before the 
rebellion. May I ask what those men 
are doing in my ship?” 

Expanded from its clamshell nose, 
the Explorer’s living bubble was 
bigger than the Explorer. Held taut 
by air pressure, isolated from 
the surrounding environment, proof 
against any atmospheric chemistry 
found in nature, the clear fabric 
hemisphere was a standard feature 
of all camper-model spacecraft. 
Mann could see biped shadows mov- 
ing purposefully about inside and 
going between the clamshell doors 
into the ship proper. 

“They’re hot stealing anything, 
Rich Mann. I sent them in to re- 
move a few components from the 
drives and the comm systems.” 
“One hopes they won’t damage 
what they remove.” 

“They won’t. They have their or- 
ders.” 

“I assume you don’t want me to 
call someone,” said Mann. He no- 



ticed that the men were preparing 
a bonfire, using stage bushes. The 
bushes were like miniature trees, 
four to six feet tall, slender and 
straight, and the brilliant yellow 
foliage at the top was flattened like 
the head of a dandelion. From the 
low, rounded eastern mountains to 
the western sea, the red land was 
sprinkled with the yellow dots of 
their heads. Men were cutting off 
the heads and roots, then dragging 
the logs away to pile them in coni- 
cal formation over a stack of death- 
dry tumbleweed heads. 

“We don’t want you to call the 
Wunderland police, who happen to 
be somewhere out there looking for 
us.” 

“I hate to pry — ” 

“No, no, you’re entitled to your 
curiosity. We’re pirates.” 

“Surely you jest. Captain Kidd, 
if you’ve figured out a way to make 
piracy pay off, you must be bright 
enough to make ten times the money 
on the stock market.” 

“Why?” 

B y the tone of his voice, by his 
gleeful smile, the Jinxian was 
baiting him. Fine; it would keep 
his mind off stage trees. Mann said, 
“Because you can’t catch a ship in 
hyperspace. The only way you can 
match courses with a ship is to wait 
until it’s in an inhabited system. 
Then the police come calling.” 

“I know an inhabited system 
where there aren’t any police.” 

“The hell you do.” 

They had walked more or less 
aimlessly to the Explorer’s airlock. 
Now the Jinxian turned and gazed 



A RELIC OF THE EMPIRE 



79 




out over the red plain, toward the 
dwindling crescent of Big Mira, 
which now looked like a bad forest 
fire. ‘Tm curious about those spires.” 
“Fine, keep your little secret. I’ve 
wondered about them myself, but I 
haven't had a chance to look at them 
yet” 

“I’d think they’d interest you. 
They look definitely artificial to me.” 
“But they’re a billion years too 
young to be Slaver artifacts.” 

“Rich Mann, are those bushes the 
only life on this planet?” 

“I haven’t seen anything else,” 
Mann lied. 

“Then it couldn’t have been a 
native race that put those spires up. 
I never heard of a space-traveling 
race that builds such big things for 
mere monuments.” 

“Neither did I. Shall we look at 
them tomorrow?” 

“Yes.^i Captain Kidd stepped in- 
to the Explorer’s airlock, wrapped 
a vast hand gently around Mann’s 
thin wrist and pulled him in beside 
him. The airlock cycled, and Mann 
followed the Jinxian into the living 
bubble with an impression that the 
Jinxian did not quite trust him. 
Fine . 

It "sfras dark inside the bubble. 
Mann hesitated before turning on 
the light* Outside he could see the 
last red sliver of Big Mira shrinking 
with visible haste. He saw more. A 
man was kneeling before the conical 
bonfire, and a flickering light was 
growing in the dried bush-head 
kindling. 

Mann turned on the lights, ob- 
literating the outside view. “Go on 
about piracy,” he said. 



“Oh, yes.” The Jinxian dropped 
into a chair, frowning. “Piracy was 
only the end product. It started a 
year ago, when I found -the puppe- 
teer system*” 

“The ” 

“Yes. The puppeteers’ home sys- 
tem.” 

Richard Mann’s ears went straight 
up. He was from Wunderland, re- 
member? 

A puppeteer may best be described 
as a headless, three-legged cen- 
taur with two Cecil the Seasick Sea 
Serpent puppets on its hands. The 
puppets are actual brainless heads 
set on weaving necks; but they are 
also hands, the only toolmaking ap- 
pendages a puppeteer can claim. A 
puppeteer’s thick, mobile lips and 
forked tongue are as dextrous as 
the human hand, with taste and 
smell thrown in for free. 

Puppeteers are highly intelligent, 
herbivorous and very old as a 
species. Their corner on interstellar 
business is as old as the human 
Bronze Age. And they are cowards. 

A courageous puppeteer is not 
regarded as insane only by other 
puppeteers. It is insane and usually 
shows disastrous secondary symp- 
toms: depression, homicidal tenden- 
cies and the like. These poor, warp- 
ed minds are easy to spot. No sane 
puppeteer will cross a vehicular road- 
way, or travel in any but the safest 
available fashion, or resist a thief, 
even an unarmed thief. No sane 
puppeteer will leave his home sys- 
tem, wherever that may be, with- 
out his painless method of suicide, 
nor will it walk an alien world with- 



80 



IF 




out guards — non-puppeteer guards. 

The location of the puppeteer sys- 
tem is one of the puppeteers’ most 
closely guarded secrets. Another is 
the painless suicide gimmick. It 
may be a mere trick of precondition- 
ing. Whatever it is, it works. Puppe- 
teers cannot be tortured into re- 
vealing anything about their home 
world, though they hate pain. It 
must be a world with reasonably 
Earthlike atmosphere and tempera- 
ture, but beyond that nothing is 
known. 

Or was known. 

Suddenly Mann wished that they 
hadn’t lit the bonfire so soon. He 
didn’t know how long it would burn 
before the logs caught, and he want- 
ed to hear more about this. 

“I found it just a year ago,” the 
Jinxian repeated. “It’s best I don’t 
tell you what I was doing up to 
then. The less you know about who 
I am, the better. But when I’d got 
safe out of the system I came 
straight home. I wanted time to 
think.” 

“And you picked piracy? Why 
not blackmail?” 

“I thought of that.” 

“I should hope so! Can you im- 
agine what the puppeteeers would 
pay to keep that secret?” 

“Yes. That’s what stopped me. 
Rich Mann, how much would you 
have asked for in one lump sum?” 
“A round billion stars and im- 
munity from prosecution.” 

“Okay. Now look at it from the 
puppeteer point of view. That billion 
wouldn’t buy them complete safety, 
because you might still talk. But 
if they spent a tenth of that on de- 



tectives, weapons, hit men, et cetera , 
they would shut your mouth for 
keeps and also find and hit anyone 
you might have talked to. I couldn’t 
figure any way to make myself safe 
and still collect, not with that much 
potential power against me. 

“So I thought of piracy. 

“Eight of us had gone in, but I 
was the only one who’d guessed just 
what we’d stumbled into. I let the 
others in on it. Some had friends 
they could trust, and that raised our 
number to fourteen. We bought a 
ship, a very old one, and renovated 
it. She’s an old slowboat’s ground- 
to-orbit auxiliary fitted out with 
hyperdrive; maybe you noticed?” 
“No. I saw how old she was.” 
“We figured even if the puppeteers 
recognized her, they’d never trace 
her. We took her back to the pup- 
peteer system and waited.” 

A flickering light glimmered out- 
side the bubble wall. Any second 
now the logs would catch. 

Mann tried to relax. 

4 4 pretty soon a ship came in. We 
1 waited ’til it was too deep in 
the system’s gravity well to jump 
back into hyperspace. Then we 
matched courses. Naturally they 
surrendered right away. We went in 
in suits so they couldn’t describe us 
even if they could tell humans apart. 
Would you believe they had six hun- 
dred million stars in currency?” 
“That’s pretty good pay. What 
went wrong?” 

“My idiot crew wouldn’t leave. 
We’d figured most of the ships com- 
ing into the puppeteer system would 
be carrying money. They’re misers, 



A RELIC OF THE EMPIRE 



81 




you know. Part of being a coward 
is wanting security. And they do 
most of their mining and manu- 
facturing on other worlds, where 
they can get labor. So we waited 
for two more ships, because we had 
room for lots more money. The 
puppeteers wouldn’t dare attack us 
inside their own system.” Captain 
Kidd made a sound of disgust. “I 
can’t really blame the men. In a 
sense they were right. One ship 
with a fusion drive can do a hell of 
a lot of damage just by hovering 
over a city. So we stayed. 

Meanwhile the puppeteers regis- 
tered a formal complaint with 
Earth. 

“Earth hates people who foul 
up interstellar trade. We’d offered 
physical harm to a puppeteer. A 
thing like that could cause a stock 
market crash. So Earth offered the 
services of every police force in hu- 
man space. Hardly seems fair!” 

“They ganged up on you. But 
they still couldn’t come after you, 
could they? The puppeteers would 
have to tell the police how to find 
their system. They’d hardly do that; 
not when some human descendant 
might attack them a thousand years 
from now.” 

The Jinxian dialed himself a 
frozen daiquiri. “They had to wait 
’til we left. I still don’t know how 
they tracked us. Maybe they’ve got 
something that can track a gravity 
wairp moving faster than light. I 
wouldn’t put it past them to build 
it just for us. Anyway, when we 
angled toward Jinx we heard them 
telling the police of We Made It 
just where we were.” 



“Ouch.” 

“We headed for the nearest double 
star. Not my idea, Hermie Pres- 
ton’s. He thought we could hide in 
the dust clouds in the trojan points. 
Whatever the puppeteers were using 
probably couldn’t find us in normal 
space.” Two thirsty gulps had finish- 
ed his daiquiri. He crumpled the 
cup, watched it evaporate, dialed an- 
other. “The nearest double star was 
Mira Ceti. We hardly expected to 
find a planet in the trailing trojan 
point, but as long as it was there we 
decided to use it.” 

“And here you are.” 

“Yeah.” 

“You’ll be better off when you’ve 
found a way to hide that ship.” 
“We had to find out about you 
first, Rich Mann. Tomorrow we’ll 
sink the Puppet Master in the ocean. 
Already we’ve shut off the fusion 
drive. The lifters work by battery, 
and the cops can’t detect that.” 
“Fine. Now for the billion dol- 
lar — ” 

“No, no, Rich Mann. I will not 
tell you where to find the puppeteer 
planet. Give up the whole idea. Shall 
we join the campfire group?” 

Mann came jokingly alert. How 
had the stage trees lasted this long. 
Thinking fast, he said, “Is your au- 
tokitchen as good as mine?” 
“Probably not. Why?” 

“Let me treat your group to din- 
ner, Captain Kidd.” 

Captain Kidd shook his head, smil- 
ing. “No offense, Rich Mann, but I 
can’t read your kitchen controls, and 
there’s no point in tempting you. 
You might rashly put someth — ” 
WHAM!

IF 




T he living bubble bulged inward, 
snapped back. Captain Kidd 
swore and ran for the airlock. 
Mann stayed seated, motionless, 
hoping against hope that the Jinxian 
had forgotten him. 

WHAM! WHAM! Flares of light 
from the region of the campfire. 
Captain Kidd frantically punched 
the Cycle button, and the opaque 
inner door closed on him. Mann 
came to his feet in one leap and 
started running. 

WHAM! The concussion hurt his 
ears and set the bubble rippling. 
Burning logs must be flying in all 
directions. The airlock recycled, 
empty. 

No telling where the Jinxian was; 
the outer door was opaque too. Well, 
that worked to his advantage as 
well. 

WHAM! 

Mann searched through the air- 
lock, pushing sections of spacesuit 
aside to find the lift belt. It wasn’t 
there. He’d been wearing it; they’d 
taken it off him after they shot him 
down. He moaned: a tormented, un- 
couth sound to come from a cultured 
Wunderlander. He had to have a lift 
belt. 

WhamWhamWham. Someone was 
screaming far away. 

Mann snatched up the suit’s chest- 
and-shoulder section and locked it 
around him. It. was rigid vacuum ar- 
mor, with a lift motor built into 
the back. He took an extra moment 
to screw down the helmet, then hit 
the Cycle button. 

No use searching for weapons. 
They’d have taken even a variable- 
knife. 



The Jinxian could be just outside 
waiting. He might have realized the 
truth by now. 

The door opened . Captain 
Kidd was easy to find, a running 
misshapen shadoW and a frantic 
booming voice. “Flatten out, you 
yeastheads! It’s an attack!” He 
hadn’t guessed. But he must know 
the We Made It police would use 
stunners .... 

Mann twisted his lift control to 
full power. 

The surge of pressure took him 
under the armpits. Two standard 
gees sent blood rushing to -his feet, 
pushed him upward with four times 
Wunderland’s gravity. A last stage 
log exploded under him, rocked him 
back and forth, and then all was 
dark and quiet. 

He adjusted the attitude setting to 
slant him almost straight forward. 
The dark ground sped beneath him. 
He moved northeast. Nobody was 
following him — yet. 

Captain Kidd’s men would have 
been killed, hurt or at least stunned 
when the campfire exploded in their 
faces. 

He’d expected Captain Kidd to 
chase him; but the Jinxian couldn’t 
have caught him. Lift motors are all 
alike, and Mann wasn’t as heavy as 
the Jinxian. 

He flew northeast, flying very 
low, knowing that the only land- 
marks big enough to smash him were 
the spires to the west. When he 
could no longer see the ships’ lights 
he turned south, still very low. Still 
nobody followed him. He was glad 
he’d taken the helmet; it protected 
his eyes from the wind.

IF 




in 

I n the blue dawn he came awake. 

The sky was darker than navy 
blue, and the light around him was 
dim, like blue moonlight. Little Mira 
was a hurtingly bright pinpoint be- 
tween two mountain peaks, bright 
enough to sear holes in a man’s re- 
tina. Mann unscrewed his helmet, 
adjusted the pink goggles over his 
eyes. Now it was even darker. 

Mann poked his nose above the 
yellow moss. 

The plain and sky were empty of 
men. The pirates must be out looking 
for him, but they hadn’t gotten here 
yet. So far so good. 

Far out across the plain there was 
fire. A stage tree rose rapidly into 
the black sky, minus its roots and 
flower, the wooden flanges at its 
base holding it in precarious aero- 
dynamic stability. A white rope of 
smoke followed it up. When the 
smoke cut off, the tree became in- 
visible . until, much higher, there 
was a puff of white cloud like a flak 
burst. Now the seeds would be 
spreading across the sky . 

Richard Mann smiled. Wonderful, 
how the stage trees had adapted to 
the loss of their masters. The Slavers 
had raised them on wide plantations, 
using the' solid fuel rocket cores in- 
side the living bark to lift their ships 
from places where a fusion drive 
would have done damage. But the 
trees used the rockets for reproduc- 
tion, to scatter their seeds further 
than any plant before them. 

Ah, well. Richard Mann snuggled 
deeper into the yellow woolly stuff 
around him and began to consider 



his next move. He was a hero now 
in the eyes of humanity-at-large. He 
had badly damaged a pirate crew. 
When the police landed he could 
count on a reward from the pup- 
peteers. Should he settle for that, or 
go on to bigger stakes? 

The Puppet Master's cargo was 
bigger stakes, certainly. But even if 
he could take it, which seemed un- 
likely, how could he fit it into his 
ship? How to escape the police of 
We Made It? 

No. Mann had another stake in 
mind, one just as valuable and in- 
finitely easier to hide. 

What Captain Kidd apparently 
hadn’t realized was that blackmail 
is not immoral to a puppeteer. There 
are well established rules of conduct 
which make blackmail perfectly safe 
both for blackmailer and victim. 
Two are that the blackmailer must 
submit to having certain portions of 
his memory erased and must turn 
over all evidence against the victim. 
Mann was prepared to do this, if 
he could force Captain Kidd to tell 
him where to find the pupppeteei* 
system. 

But how? 

Well, he knew one thing the 
Jinxian didn’t . 

L ittle Mira rose, fast, arc blue, a 
hole into hell. Mann remained 
where he was, an insignificant mote 
in the yellow vegetation below one 
of the spires Captain Kidd had re- 
marked on last night. The spire was 
a good half mile high. An artifact 
that size would seem impossibly huge 
to any but an Earthman. The way 
it loomed over him made Mann un- 



A RELIC OF THE EMPIRE 



85 




comfortable. In shape it was a slen- 
der cone with a base three hundred 
feet across. The surface near the 
base was gray and smooth to touch. 

The yellow vegetation was a thick, 
rolling carpet. It spread out around 
the spire in an uneven circle half a 
mile in diameter and dozens of feet 
deep. It rose about the base in a 
thick turtleneck collar. Close up, 
the stuff wasn’t even distinct plants. 
It looked like a cross between moss 
and wool, dyed flagrant yellow. 

It made a good hiding place. Not 
perfect, of course; a heat sensor 
would pick him out in a flash. He 
hadn’t thought of that last night, and 
now it worried him. Should he get 
out, try to reach the sea? 

The ship would certainly carry a 
heat sensor, but not a portable one. 
A portable heat sensor would be a 
weapon, a nighttime gunsight, and 
weapons of war had been illegal for 
some time in human space. 

But the Puppet Master could have 
stopped elsewhere to get such im- 
plements. Kzinti, for example. 

Nonsense. Why would Captain 
Kidd have needed portable weapons 
with night gunsights? He certainly 
hadn’t expected puppeteers to fight 
hand-to-hand! The stunners were 
mercy weapons. Even a pirate would 
not dare kill a puppeteer, and Cap- 
tain Kidd was no ordinary pirate. 

All right. Radar-? He need only 
burrow into the moss/wool. Sight 
search? Same answer. Radio? Mental 
note: do not transmit anything. 

Mental note? There was a dicta- 
phone in his helmet. He used it 
after pulling the helmet out of the 
moss/wool around him. 



Flying figures. Mann watched 
them for a long moment, trying to 
spot the Jinxian. There were only 
four, and he wasn’t among them. 
The four were flying northwest of 
him, moving south. Mann ducked 
into the moss. 

“Hello, Rich Mann.” 

The voice was low, contorted with 
fury. Mann felt the shock race 
through him, contracting every 
muscle with the fear of death. It 
came from behind him! 

. From his helmet. 

“Hello, Rich Mann. Guess where 
I am?” 

H e couldn’t turn it off. Spacesuit 
helmet radios weren’t built to 
be turned off: a standard safety fac- 
tor. If one were fool enough to 
ignore safety, one could insert an 
“off” switch; but Mann had never 
felt the need. 

“I’m in your ship, using your ship- 
to-suit radio circuit. That was a good 
trick you played last night. I didn’t 
even know what a stage tree was 
’til I looked it up in your library.” 
He’d just have to endure it. A 
pity he couldn’t answer back. 

“You killed four of my men and 
put five more in the autodoc tanks. 
Why’d you do it, Rich Mann? You 
must have known we weren’t going 
to kill you. Why should we? There’s 
no blood on our hands.” 

You lie, Mann thought at the ra- 
dio. People die in a market crash . 
And the ones who live are the ones 
who suffer. Do you know what it f s 
like to be suddenly poor, and not 
know how to live poor? 

“I’ll assume you want something, 



86 



IF 




Rich Mann. All right. What? The 
money in my hold? That’s ridiculous. 
You’d never get in. You want to 
turn us in for a reward? Fat chance. 
You’ve got no weapons. If we find 
you now we’ll kill you.” 

The four searchers passed far to 
the west, their headlamps spreading 
yellow light across the blue dusk. 
They were no danger to him now. 
A pity they and their fellows should 
have been involved in what amount- 
ed to a vendetta. 

“The puppeteer planet, of course. 
The modern El Dorado. But you 
don’t know where it is, do you? I 
wonder if I ought to give you a hint. 
Of course you’d never know whether 
I was telling the truth.” 

Did the Jinxian know how to live 
poor? Mann shuddered. The old 
memories came back, but rarely; but 
when they came they hurt. 

You have to learn not to buy 
luxuries before you've bought neces- 
sities . You can starve learning which 
is which . Necessities are food and a 
place to sleep , shoes and pants. 
Luxuries are tobacco , restaurants , 
fine shirts , throwing away a ruined 
meal while you're learning to cook , 
quitting a job you don't like. A 
union is a necessity. Boosterspice is 
a luxury. » 

The Jinxian wouldn’t know about 
that. He’d had the money to buy his 
own ship. 

“Ask me politely, Rich Mann. 
Would you like to know where I 
found the puppeteer system?” 

Mann had leased the Explorer on 
a college grant. It had been the 
latest step in a long climb upward. 
Before that . 



He was half his lifetime old when 
the crash came. Until then booster- 
spice had kept him as young as the 
ageless idle ones who were his 
friends and relatives. Overnight he 
was one of the hungry. A number 
of his partners in disaster had rid- 
den their lift belts straight up into 
eternity; Richard Schultz-Mann had 
sold his for his final dose of booster- 
spice. Before he could afford booster- 
spice again there were wrinkles in 
his forehead, the texture of his skin 
had changed, his sex urge had de- 
creased, strange white patches ap- 
peared in his hair, there were twinges 
in his back. He still got them. 

Yet always he had maintained his 
beard. With the white spike and the 
white streak it looked better than 
ever. After the boosterspice restored 
color to his hair he dyed the patches 
back in again. 

“Answer me, Rich Mann!” 

Go ride a bander snatch. 

It was a draw. Captain Kidd 
couldn’t entice him into answering, 
and Mann would never know the 
pirate’s secret. If Kidd dropped his 
ship in the sea, Mann could show 
it to the police. At least that would 
be something. 

Luckily Kidd couldn’t move the 
Explorer. Otherwise he could take 
both ships half around the planet, 
leaving Mann stranded. 

The four pirates were far to the 
south. Captain Kidd had apparently 
given up on the radio. There were 
water and food syrup in his helmet; 
Mann would not starve. 

Where in blazes were the police? 
On the other side of the planet? 

Stalemate. 



A RELIC OF THE EMPIRE

IV 

B ig Mira came as a timorous peep- 
ing Tom, poking his rim over 
the mountains like red smoke. The 
land brightened, taking on tinges of 
lavender against long, long navy blue 
shadows. The shadows shortened 
and became vague. 

The morality of his position was 
beginning to bother Dr. Richard 
Mann. 

In attacking the pirates he had 
done his duty as a citizen. The pi- 
rates had sullied humanity’s hard- 
won reputation for honesty. Mann 
had struck back. 

But his motive? Fear had been 
two parts of that motive. First, the 
fear that Captain Kidd might decide 
to shut his mouth. Second, the fear 
of being poor. 

That fear had been with him for 
some time. 

Write a book and make a for- 
tune! It looked good on paper. The 
thirty-light-year sphere of human 
space contained nearly a trillion 
readers. Persuade one per cent of 
them to shell out half a star each for 
a disposable tape and your four per 
cent royalties became two hundred 
million stars. But most books nowa- 
days were flops. You had to scream 
very loud nowadays to get the at- 
tention of even ten billion readers. 
Others tried to* drown you out. 

Before Captain Kidd, that had 
been Richard Schultz-Mann’s sole 
hope of success. 

He’d behaved within the law. Cap- 
tain Kidd couldn’t make that claim; 
but Captain Kidd hadn’t killed any- 
body. 



Mann sighed. He’d had no choice. 
His major motive was honor, and 
that motive still held. 

He moved restlessly in his nest 
of damp moss/wool. The day was 
heating up, and his suit’s tempera- 
ture control would not work with 
half a suit. 

What was that? 

It was the Puppet Master , moving 
effortlessly toward him on its lift- 
ers. The Jinxian must have decided 
to get it under water before the hu- 
man law arrived. 

... Or had he? 

Mann adjusted his lift motor until 
he was just short of weightless, then 
moved cautiously around -the spire. 
He saw the four pirates moving to 
the Puppet Master . They’d see him 
if he left the spire. But if he stayed, 
those infrared detectors . 

He’d have to chance it. 

The suit’s padded shoulders goug- 
ed his armpits as he streaked 
toward the second spire. He stopped 
in midair over the moss and 
dropped, burrowed in it. The pirates 
didn’t swerve. 

Now he’d see. 

The ship slowed to a stop over 
the spire he’d just left. 

“Can you hear me, Rich Mann?” 

Mann nodded gloomily to himself. 
Definitely, that was it. 

“I should have tried this before. 
Since you’re nowhere in sight, you’ve 
either left the vicinity altogether or 
you’re hiding in the thick bushes 
around those towers.” 

Should he try to keep dodging 
from spire to spire? Or could he out- 
fly them? 

At least one was bound to be 



IF 




faster than he. The armor increased 
his weight. 

“I hope you took the opportunity 
to examine this tower. It’s fascinat- 
ing. Very smooth, stony surface, ex- 
cept at the top. A perfect cone, al- 
so except at the top. You listening? 
The tip of this thing swells from 
an eight foot neck into an egg- 
shaped knob fifteen feet across. The 
knob isn’t polished as smooth as the 
rest of it. Vaguely reminiscent of an 
asparagus spear, wouldn’t you say?” 
Richard Schultz-Mann cocked his 
head, tasting an idea. 

H e unscrewed his helmet, ripped 
out and pocketed the radio. In 
frantic haste he began ripping out 
double handfuls of the yellow moss/ 
wool, stuffed them into a wad in the 
helmet and turned his lighter on it. 

At first the vegetation merely 
smoldered, while Mann muttered 
through clenched teeth. Then it 
caught with a weak blue, smokeless 
flame. Mann placed his helmet in a 
mossy nest, setting it so it would not 
tip over and spill its burning con- 
tents. 

“I’d have said a phallic symbol, 
myself. What do you think, Rich 
Mann? If these are phallic symbols 
they’re pretty well distorted. Huma- 
noid, but not human, you might 
say.” 

The pirates had joined their ship. 
They hovered around its floating sil- 
ver bulk, ready to drop on him 
when the Puppet Masters infrared 
detectors found him. 

Mann streaked away to the west 
on full acceleration, staying as low 
as he dared. The spire would shield 



A RELIC OF THE EMPIRE 




him for a minute or so and then . 

“This vegetation isn’t stage trees, 
Rich Mann. It looks like some sort 
of grass from here. Must need some- 
thing in the rock they made these 
erections out of. Mph. No hot spots. 
You’re not down there after all. 
Well, we try the next one.” 

Behind him, in the moments when 
he dared look back, Mann saw the 
Puppet Master move to cover the 
second spire, the one he’d left a mo- 
ment ago, the one with a gray streak 
in the moss at its base. Four huma- 
noid dots clustered loosely above the 
ship. 

“Peekaboo,” came the Jinxian’s 
voice. “And good-by, killer!” 

T he Puppet Master’s fusion drive 
went on. Fusion flame lashed 
out in a blue-white spear, played 
down the side of the pillar and 
into the moss/wool below. 

Mann faced forward and concen- 
trated on flying. He felt neither ela- 
tion nor pity, but only disgust. The 
Jinxian was a fool after all. He’d 
seen no life on Mira Ceti-T but for 
the stage trees. He had Mann’s word 
that there were none. Couldn’t 
he reach the obvious conclusion? 
Perhaps the moss/wool had fooled 
him. It certainly did look like yellow 
moss, clustering around the spires 
as if it needed some chemical ele- 
ment in the stone. 

A glance back told him that the 
pirate ship was still spraying white 
flame over the spire and the foliage 
below. He’d have been a cinder by 
now. The Jinxian must want him ex- 
tremely dead. Well — 

The spire exploded all at once. 



It sat on the lavender plain in a 
hemisphere of multicolored fire, en- 
gulfing the other spires and the 
Jinxian ship; and then it began to 
expand and rise. Mann adjusted his 
attitude to vertical to get away from 
the ground. A moment later the 
shock wave slammed into him and 
blew him tumbling over the desert. 

Two white ropes of smoke rose 
straight up through the dimming 
explosion cloud. The other spires 
were taking off while still green! 
Fire must have reached the ‘foliage 
at their bases. 

Mann watched them go with his 
head thrown back and his body 
curiously loose in the vacuum ar- 
mor. His expression was strangely 
contented. At these times he could 
forget himself and his ambitions in 
the contemplation of immortality. 

Two knots formed simultaneously 
in the rising smoke trails. Second 
stage on. They rose very fast 
now .... 

“Rich Mann.” 

Mann flicked his transmitter on. 
“You’d live through anything.” 

“Not I. I can’t feel anything be- 
low my shoulders. Listen, Rich 
Mann, I’ll trade secrets with you. 
What happened?” 

“The big towers are stage trees.” 

“Uh?” Half question, half an 
expression of agony. 

“A stage tree has two life cycles. 
One is the bush, the other is the big 
multistage form.” Mann talked fast, 
fearful of losing his audience. “The 
forms alternate. A stage tree seed 
lands on a planet and grows into a 
bush. Later there are lots of bushes. 
When a seed hits a particularly fer- 



90 



IF 




tile spot, it grows into a multi- 
stage form. You still there?” 

“Yuh.” 

“In the big form the living part 
is the tap root and the photosyn- 
thetic organs around the base. That 
way the rocket section doesn’t have 
to carry so much weight. It grows 
straight up out of the living part, 
but it’s as dead as the center of an 
oak except for the seed at the top. 
When it’s ripe the rocket takes off. 
Usually it’ll reach terminal velocity 
for the system it’s in. Kidd, I can’t 
see your ship, I’ll have to wait ’til 
the smoke — ” 

“Just keep talking.” ^ 

“I’d like to help.” 

“Too late. Keep talking.” 

( 4T’ve tracked the stage trees across 
A twenty light-years of space. 
God knows where they started. 
They’re all through the systems 
around here. The seed pods spend 
hundreds of thousands of years in 
space, and when they enter a system 
they explode. If there’s a habitable 
world one seed is bound to hit it. If 
there isn’t, there’s lots more pods 
where that one came from. It’s im- 
mortality, Captain Kidd. This one 
plant has traveled further than man- 
kind, and it’s much older. A billion 
and a — 



“Twenty-three point six, seventy 
point one, six point nil. I don’t know 
its name on the star charts. Shall 
I repeat that?” 

Mann forgot the stage trees. “Bet- 
ter repeat it.” 

“Twenty-three point six, seventy 
point one, six point nothing. Hunt 
in that area ’til you find it. It’s a- 
red giant, undersized. Planet is small, 
dense, no moon.” 

“Got it.” 

“You’re stupid if you use it. You’ll 
have the same luck I did. That’s 
why I told you.” 

“I’ll use blackmail.” 

“They’ll kill you. Otherwise I 
wouldn’t have said. Why’d you kill 
me, Rich Mann?” 

“I didn’t like your remarks about 
my beard. Never insult a Wunder- 
lander’s asymmetric beard, Captain 
Kidd.” 

“I won’t do it again, you can be 
sure of that. 

“I’d like to help.” Mann peered 
into the billowing smoke. Now it was 
a black pillar tinged at the edges by 
the twin sunlight. “Still can’t see 
your ship.” 

“You will in a moment.” 

The pirate moaned . and Mann 
saw the ship. He managed to turn 
his head in time to save his eyes.

The "Other” Fandoms 

by LIN CARTER 



Now that Our Man in Fandom has 
shown you what sf fans are like, 
meet a few other species of fan! 



P lease don’t get the idea that sci- 
ence-fiction fans are interested 
in science fiction only l Because it’s 
just not so. The world of sf fandom 
likes to think of itself as being a 
microcosm of the outside world: a 
world in miniature. And just as in 
the outside world people have some 
main interests in common, but also 
other interests in particular — so it 
is in fandom. 

Everybody who reads has a few 
very favorite writers. In fandom, 
people with like interests tend to 
get together and form clubs and 
publish fanzines and even have con- 
ventions dedicated to their particular 
private interests. Since I’ve been 
writing’ these Our Man In Fandom 
columns, I’ve had letters from * lots 
of science-fiction readers who liter- 
ally never dreamed there were clubs 
and magazines devoted to sf. The 
fact ikat there are fandoms within 
Fandom is even less known to you 
of the Outside World. 



If you happen to be fond of the 
Oz books, Sherlock Holmes, The 
Lord of the Rings , Edgar Rice Bur- 
roughs, Robert E. Howard, monster 
movies, James Branch Cabell, old 
comic strips and comic books, Gothic 
literature, movie serials and jolly 
stuff like that, you may be excited 
to hear there exist whole clubfulls of 
kindreds souls. And you might want 
to know how to get in touch with 
one of these “other” fandoms. So 
hang on, while Your Man In Fan- 
dom takes you on another Guided 
Tour of the Twilight Zone . 

Burrough Fandom 

S ome writers — and some books 
— have about them a magic, 
a charisma, that attracts devotees 
and acolytes with incredible magne- 
tism. Edgar Rice Burroughs is a 
prime example. His career began 
with the February 1912 issue of All- 
Story, and the first installment of A 



92 




Princess of Mars . Today, 54 years 
later, lie is remembered as perhaps 
the single most successful writer in 
the English language, author of some 
65 books which have sold more than 
forty million copies in 58 languages. 
For about ten years now there has 
been a club of Burroughs fans called 
The Burroughs Bibliophiles which 
was founded by top ERB-fan Vernell 
Coriell. 

The Burroughs Bibliophiles got a 
giant-sized membership boost some 
years ago when Don Wollheim of 
Ace Books discovered the Bur- 
roughs estate had allowed copy- 
rights to lapse on a more-than-good- 
ly number of Burrough’s works 
and was thus able to bring out the 
books in Ace editions, starting a Bur- 
roughs revival the likes of which had 
never been seen before. The Biblio- 
philes now number about 1000. 

Within Burroughs fandom are 
some active and devoted ERB-peo- 
ple. Vernell Coriell publishes a 
magazine of ERB lore called The 
Gridley Wave. And Camille Caza- 
dessus, Jr., who rivals him for the 
title of ERB Fan #1, publishes ERB- 
dom. All sorts of books and pamph- 
lets on Burroughs have been private- 
ly published by the Burroughs fans, 
such a s The Dream Weaver: an Ed- 
gar Rice Burroughs Chapboolc, by 
Alvin Fick (1962); Edgar Rice Bur- 
roughs, A Bibliography, by Bradford 
M. Day (1962); A Golden Anniver- 
sary Bibliography of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs, by Henry Hardy Heins 
(1962); and The Reader’s Guide to 
Barsoom and Amt or, by David G. 
Van Arnam (1963). The ERB fans 
hold an annual “dum-dum” (that’s 



Ape for get-together) which coin- 
cides with the yearly World Science 
Fiction Convention, same Labor Day 
weekend, same hotel. If you chance 
to be fond of Tarzan and John Car- 
ter of Mars and would like to join 
the Bibliophiles, why not drop a 
card to Vernell Coriell at 6657 Lo- 
cust, Kansas City, Mo. 

Sword & Sorcery Fandom 

A nother writer of comparable 
charisma, who learned a lot 
from Burroughs and who wrote 
pretty much the same sort of ad- 
venture fiction, was Robert E. How- 
ard. He was an old Weird Tales au- 
thor, who created Conan the Cim- 
merian, a grim, savage barbarian 
warrior who strode about the pre- 
historic Hyborian Age looking for 
princesses to rescue, magicians to 
fight and monsters to kill. The ro- 
bust and heroic fantasy of his fic- 
tion attracted many fans, and when 
the Conan books began to be re- 
printed in hardcover editions by 
Gnome Press, publisher Martin 
Greenberg, author L. Sprague de 
Camp, critic John D. Clark and 
some other nice people founded 
The Hyborian Legion to commemo- 
rate his creation. 

Membership gets you a gorgeous 
scroll in Egyptian hieroglyphics. And 
there is a fanzine, Amra, devoted to 
Howard and Burroughs and Leiber 
and other things swordlike and 
sorcerous. Amra (“The Lion” — 
Conan’s name when he was a pirate) 
is a beautifully printed fanzine, win- 
ner of the Hugo Award, and regular- 
ly contains stories, articles, book re- 



THE "OTHER" FANDOMS 



93 




views and verse by such Hyborians 
as Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, 
Leigh Brackett, Sprague de Camp, 
artist Roy Krenkel and others (in- 
cluding Your Man in Fandom.) The 
latest issue I have seen was Vol. 2, 
Number 41. 

The Legion has permanent offi- 
cers such as the King of Aquilonia, 
the Count of Poitain, the Royal 
Sorceror, the Commander of the 
Black Dragons, etc. And there’s an 
annual Muster of the Legion which 
coincides with the World Conven- 
tion as does the Burroughsian dum- 
dum. Legion people also publish 
magazines like The Howard Collec- 
tor , Glenn Lord’s excellent occasion- 
al fanzine, now in its seventh issue. 

Since the Conan books are now 
being published in paperbacks from 
Lancer Books (yes, the ones with 
the mind-staggeringly gorgeous Fra- 
zetta cover-paintings!), any How- 
ard fan, old or new, can find out 
about the Legion and Amra by writ- 
ing to the editor, George Scithers, 
Amra f Box 9120, Chicago, 111. 

Tolkien Fandom 

M aybe Conan is new to you, but 
surely you’ve read The Lord 
of the Rings! This mammoth trilogy 
by Oxford don J.R.R Tolkien had its 
first beginnings in a children’s book 
called Thi Hobbit (1937). The 
Trilogy itself, completed in 1956 and 
containing some 1,300 pages of su- 
perb fantasy, has been discovered by 
millions of (high school and college 
undergraduates, and other people 
(among them, C.S. Lewis, Richard 
Hughes, W.H. Auden, Naomi Mitch- 



ison, Anthony Boucher, and other 
critics and literary figures). There 
be some (myself among them) who 
feel LOTR is the greatest fan- 
tasy of the century. Be that as it 
may, the $15 price for the hard- 
cover edition from Houghton Miff- 
lin placed these great books out of 
reach until just recently, when Ace 
Books brought out the entire trilogy 
in paperback — followed closely by 
Ballantine Books, with “The Au- 
thorized Edition.” By now, the pa- 
perback set is a runaway best seller 
and an underground classic of awe- 
some success. Both pb sets have sold 
more than a quarter of a million 
copies in 10 months. 

With all this excitement going on, 
it’s no wonder there’s a Tolkien So- 
ciety of America now forming. It 
hasn’t been in existence for very 
long, but it already has upwards of 
one thousand members who meet or 
exchange views by means of cor- 
respondence or specialized Tolkien- 
ian magazines. They are particularly 
excited (and you may be, too) to 
learn that Tolkien has been and 
currently is working on an equally 
mammoth sequel to The Lord of 
the Rings since he concluded the 
first trilogy 13 years ago. It will be 
called The Silmarillion and, unlike 
most sequels I know of, it takes place 
EARLIER than the book it sequeli- 
zes. Earlier, like by a couple of 
thousand years or so! 

Organized by a youthful Tolkien 
enthusiast here in New York — 17- 
year-old, Harvard-bound Dick Plotz 
— the Tolkien Society of America 
has had its meetings discussed wide- 
ly, in The New Yorker and The 



94 



IF 




Saturday Evening Post, for example. 
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet W. H. 
Auden attended the first meeting and 
spoke briefly on Tolkien (he was one 
of Professor Tolkien’s students at 
Oxford years ago). 

The Society publishes a quarterly 
Tolkien Journal full of news, articles, 
poems, stories, book reviews, art 
and letters. There is also an irregular 
supplement, a newsletter or bulletin 
called The Green Dragon . Other 
Tolkien Fandom magazines include 
7 Palantir (the first of them all, I be- 
lieve), George Heap’s Ancalagon, 
Greg Shaw’s Entmoot. The Society 
meets at the home of Dick Plotz, 
the “Thain” or headman, at 159 
Marlborough Rd., Brooklyn, New 
York. Corresponding memberships 
(i.e., those who can’t attend meetings 
in person) are scattered throughout 
44 states; there are local, regional 
chapters called “smials.” If you are 
interested, drop a note to Dick Plotz 
at the address above. 

Supernatural Horror Fandom 

T hen there are they who relish the 
macabre over the heroic. One 
group of demonic devotees, The 
Otranto Residents Society, very in- 
formal, *was founded circa 1950, de- 
voted to “the Gothic novel and the 
Gothic film” — and they mean the 
REAL Gothic novel, the literary 
movement Horace Walpole began 
back in the 18th Century when he 
wrote The Castle of Otranto (from 
which the Society takes its name), 
not these silly romantic mysteries 
for women that are all over the 
newsstands these days, with myster- 



ious old houses brooding in the back- 
ground, one lighted window in the 
tower, gal in white nightgown in 
foreground, you know what I mean. 

Head Resident is a New York tele- 
vision producer named Chris Stein- 
brunner, who lives in Elmhurst, Long 
Island. The Society has fostered an- 
other group called The Fantasy Film 
Club, also under Chris Steinbrunner’s 
aegis. They meet weekly and run off 
an old movie, either a classic of the 
creepy, like Frankenstein Meets The 
Wolf man, or sometimes a corny but 
delightful old movie serial like The 
Whispering Shadow or Drums of 
Fu Manchu. 

The Otranto Residents Society 
and The Fantasy Film Club have an 
annual Halloween costume party. 
They also sponsor occasional open- 
to-the-public film showings of the 
Flash Gordon serials and similar 
things at the McBurney YMCA in 
New York City. And they often at- 
tend sneak previews or special pre- 
view showings of forthcoming films 
in the field of the supernatural. 
Among the members are Charles M. 
Collins, Jr., editor of Fright !, a spec- 
tacularly successful (3 printings!) 
and extraordinarily good Gothic an- 
thology, Ken Beale (an editor of the 
Monster Movie Magazine, Castle of 
Frankenstein) and, for that matter, 
Your Man In Fandom. 

Movie Monster Fandom 

S peaking of Hollywood horrors, 
there a miniature fandom in that 
field, too. This fandom has only 
sprung up in the last decade or so, 
when the magazines like Famous

Monsters of Filmland and the above- 
mention CoF began publishing. But 
this sub-branch of fandom is boom- 
ing, publishing monster fanzines 
galore, like Gore Creatures which 
comes from Baltimore; Famous 
Fantasy Films from Brookline, 
Mass.; Classics of the Horror Screen 
which emerges from Canada; Hor- 
ror Scope from Amarillo, Texas; 
Famous Fiends from Filmdom, 
which escapes regularly from Belle- 
vue — I mean, Belleville! — Illinois, 
and dozens more. 

Within Monster Fandom are loads 
of small clubs devoted to favorite 
actors: an Oliver Reed Fanclub in 
Trenton, N.J., a Christopher Lee 
Fan Club in Warwick, Rhode Is- 
land; an Alfred Hitchcock Fan Club 
in Massachusetts; and even some- 
thing called The Count Dracula So- 
ciety, which sounds rather ominous. 

These movie horror fans are quite 
scattered and have not yet been 
brought together into one central or- 
ganization. But there are signs of 
one in the making: at least, there 
was a Manhattan Monstercon held 
here in New York on September 18, 

1965, and there will be another one 
sometime in the latter months of 

1966. So — who knows? 

I see I have run out of the space 
allotted to me, so we’ll see you next 
month, when Your Man In Fandom 
will lead you in exploring The In- 
ternational Wizard of Oz Fan Club, 
the worldwide Sherlock Holmes fan- 
dom, comic book fandom in general 
and The International Comic Society 
in particular, the new James Branch

Call Me Dumbo 

by BOB SHAW 

Illustrated by FINLAY 



The trouble with being Dumbo was 
that some things got mixed up. 
Like 'where Dumbo was — and who! 



I 

T he thoughts were strange, and 
they hurt. 

My husband is called Carl — and 
that’s a nice name. My three little 
sons are called David, Aaron and 
John -r- and those are nice names. 
But I’m called Dumbo — and that 
sounds silly. It isn’t even like a real 
name. How did I get it in the first 
place? 

Dumbo bustled around the cottage 
trying to quiet her mind with work. 
Morning sunlight streamed across 
the breakfast table, making it glow 
like an altar. She set out five dishes 
of hot porridge then went to fetch 



the children who were tumbling 
noisily in her flower garden. Once 
out in the peaceful, sun-filled air 
she felt a little better. Beyond the 
picket fence the grain fields which 
Carl tended so carefully rolled down 
to the river like unleashed bolts of 
yellow satin. 

“Come for your breakfast,” she 
called. “And don’t trample my roses, 
David. You’d miss the pretty colors 
as much as anybody.” 

“What roses?” David’s six-year-old 
face was flushed with exertion. “You 
mean these green things?” The 
younger boys tittered admiringly. 

“ Those roses,” Dumbo empha- 
sized. 



97 





“ Those roses,” Dumbo empha- 
sized. 

David pointed straight at the 
freshly opened, deep red blossoms. 
“You mean these green things?” 
Dumbo hesitated uneasily. David 
was being naughty, showing off to 
his brothers, but he was full of confi- 
dence, compactly indomitable as 
only a healthy child can be. And 
he had said this sort of thing before. 
Dumbo stared at the roses, but her 
eyes had begun to hurt now. 

“Into the house!” she commanded. 
“Your porridge will be cold.” 

They went into the coolness of 
the whitewashed walls, and the chil- 
dren scrambled up on their chairs. 
Carl came in from the outhouse 
where he kept his pets and nodded 
approvingly as he saw the children 
eat. The faded shirt stretched across 
his thick, powerfully sloping shoul- 
ders was already dappled with sweat. 

“Have your breakfast now, dar- 
ling,” Dumbo said concernedly. “You 
worry more about the animals than 
about yourself.” 

“Daddy fixed the rabbit’s leg,” 
Aaron announced proudly. 

Carl smiled at the child as he sat 
down, and Dumbo felt a flash of 
jealousy. She decided to win a smile 
with a trick that never failed. 

“Some day Daddy’s going to have 
a daughter to worry about — and 
then he’ll have ho time for rabbits.” 
Carl kept his head down, scooping 
porridge into his mouth. 

“We have to have a baby 
girl,” Dumbo persisted, disappointed. 
“Isn’t that so darling?” 

Behind his rimless glasses Carl’s 
pale blue eyes shuttled briefly. 



“Your Daddy,” Dumbo switched 
to the children, “just lives for the 
day when we’ll have our own 
little . ” 

“For Christ's sake T Carl’s spoon 
clattered into the dish, and his shoul- 
ders worked beneath the straining 
shirt. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly. 
“Of course we’ve got to have a girl. 
Now will you please sit down and 
eat your own breakfast? Will you 
please?” 

D umbo smiled happily and took 
her seat. Carl had given her 
the reassurance she wanted. It was 
good to know she was loved, and yet 
the disturbing new thoughts thudded 
continuously in her head. Who ever 
heard of a name like Dumbo? She 
should be called something different.' 
A nice womajily, motherly name. 
Something like . perhaps . 
Victor ... no, that’s a man-name 
. Victoria would be nice . 

She finished her porridge and 
brought a plateful of smoking grid- 
dle-cakes to the table. The children 
chirped excitedly. They ate in com- 
parative silence for a while, then 
Dumbo felt the pressure build up 
again. 

“Carl, darling. I don’t like being 
called Dumbo. It isn’t a nice name. 
I want to be called Victoria.” 

Carl abruptly stopped chewing 
and looked at her with bleak, un- 
friendly eyes. “You didn’t take your 
medicine this week. Did you?” 

“I did,” Dumbo answered quick- 
ly. “You know I never miss it.” She 
could not remember having seen 
Carl look at her like that ever before, 
and she was afraid. 



98 



IF 




“Don’t lie to me, Dumbo.” 

“But I . .” 

“Into the bedroom, Dumbo.” 

Carl stood up and told the boys 
to continue eating. He followed 
Dumbo into the bedroom, took the 
black hypodermic gun from its case 
and poured three drops into the 
chamber from Dumbo’s egg-shaped 
medicine bottle. 

“I’m disappointed in you, Dum- 
bo,” Carl said, his thick fingers 
husking audibly against each other 
as he primed the gun’s pressure cy- 
linder. 

For a moment Dumbo considered 
the almost blasphemous act of resist- 
ing her husband’s will, but Carl gave 
her no chance. He pinned her big 
soft body to the wall with his fore- 
arm and fired the hypodermic into 
her throat. The charge felt ice cold, 
stinging. 

“Don’t forget it again,” Carl said, 
putting the gun away. 

Dumbo blinked back tears. Why 
was Carl being so unkind? He knew 
she put her duty to him and the 
children above everything. And she 
never omitted her weekly shot. 

Back at the table Carl ate in si- 
lence until his plate was clear. He 
got up, kissed the three boys and 
went to the door. Morning light 
caught his spectacles, turning the 
lenses into miniature suns. 

“I’m going to the village after 
lunch,” he said to Dumbo, “so check 
the larder this morning.” 

“All right, darling. We need cof- 
fee.” 

“Don’t try to remember it — just 
check it.” 

“All right, darling.” 



When he had gone Dumbo began 
tidying the cottage* aware once 
more of the pain b^iind her eyes. 
The children played with the re- 
mains of the breakfast, and Dumbo 
left well enough alone, thinking idly 
that she might like to go into the 
village in the afternoon with Carl. 
Finally the boys’ quiet absorption 
with the scraps degenerated into 
horseplay, and Dumbo determinedly 
pushed them outside. It was a long 
time since she had been to the vil- 
lage, and if she got through her 
work early . 

“Lend me your egg, Mum.” It 
was Aaron, the four-year-old. “I 
want to play with it.” 

Dumbo laughed. “I have no egg, 
sweetie. We haven’t had eggs in the 
house for years.” 

“That’s a big lie,” Aaron said ac- 
cusingly. “You have an egg! In your 
bedroom. In there.” 

Dumbo hardly heard. Why were 
there no eggs in the house? Eggs 
are so good for children. That settled 
it. She would go to the village with 
Carl and attend to the shopping her- 
self. It was so long since she had 
been there she had almost forgot- 
ten .. Her thoughts returned to 
Aaron. 

“That isn’t an egg, silly,” she said, 
ushering the child out. “That’s my 
medicine bottle. It just looks like an

Aaron refused to be ushered. 
“It is an egg. I know ’cause David 
told me. David boiled it last week, 
but he must have boiled it too much 
’cause it wouldn’t crack.” 

“Well, that was very naughty of 
David,” Dumbo said, feeling faint

heart-whispers of alarm. ‘That’s my 
medicine bottle, and Daddy doesn’t 
like anyone to touch it.” She had no 
idea what was in the little bottle, but 
she sensed that boiling it might do 
it harm. Carl stored the main supply 
in the coolest part of the outhouse. 

Aaron looked gleefully over his 
shoulder. “Are you going to spank 
David?” 

“Perhaps,” Dumbo said numbly. 
“I’m not sure.” She found it dif- 
ficult to speak. The pain behind her 
eyes had grown worse, and she had 
just realized that, although the fam- 
ily had lived at the cottage for many 
years, she had hardly ever set foot 
outside its neat, white picket fence. 
And it was so long since she had 
been to the village, she was no longer 
sure of the way. 

II 

D umbo brooded over it during the 
morning. 

The act of worrying was strange 
to her, but deep wells of comfort 
within her broad, heavy body seem- 
ed to be drying up. Under the 
ankle-length dress insistent perspira- 
tion swept her skin so that she walk- 
ed with an unpleasant, rubbery 
slither of thighs. Several times she 
was tempted to shorten a dress to 
a more comfortable length, but it 
would have made Carl angry, and 
she already annoyed him once that 
day. Her purpose in life was to give 
Carl love and happiness, not to an- 
noy him. 

Carl returned from the fields ear- 
ly, carrying a scythe with a broken 
handle. He ate lunch quickly and, 



with only a perfunctory check on 
the pets, settled down on the back 
porch of repair the scythe. He work- 
ed in silence, massive shoulders bow- 
ed in what looked, to Dumbo, 
strangely like loneliness. In spite ol[ 
the distraction of her headache, she 
felt a pang of unhappiness. She went 
out and knelt beside him. Carl 
glanced up, and his eyes were sud- 
denly sick. 

“See to the children,” he said. 

“They’re asleep. The heat* . .” 

“Then find something else to do.” 

Dumbo walked away blindly and 
began cleaning the already clean 
kitchen. A few minutes later Carl 
came in. Dumbo turned to him hope- 
fully. 

“I’m going to the village now,” 
he said flatly. “Where’s the list?” 

Dumbo gave him the paper and 
watched from the door as he went 
out through the front gate and walk- 
ed down the path to the river. She 
wished things were better, that she 
was pregnant again, this time with 
the girl child Carl wanted so des- 
perately. That would make things 
good again, perhaps even better 
than they had ever been before. Al- 
most before she understood what 
was happening, Dumbo found her- 
self out through the gate, out into 
the unfamiliar world of brilliant yel- 
lows, and following Carl towards the 
village. 

At first she was afraid, then her 
excitement became too strong. She 
could give the excuse that he al- 
ways forgot to bring eggs, and, any- 
way, it would be fun to go into the 
village and see other people again 
after all this time. Dumbo kept well

behind Carl, now determined not to 
be seen too soon. 

Carl turned right at the river, 
walked along the bank for ten min- 
utes, crossed a ford of flat stones 
and climbed the steep, grassy hill on 
the far side. Dumbo waited cau- 
tiously until Carl had vanished over 
the crest before she gathered up her 
skirts and crossed the river. Going 
up the hill, she guessed the village 
must be visible from the top because 
Carl had often made the round trip 
in less than an hour, Heat and exer- 
tion in her heavy, shapeless garments 
made Dumbo’s head feel worse, but 
she was keyed up at the prospect of 
seeing the village, the stores, the 
people. She’d walk with Carl a little 
while even if he was mad at her. 

On the dusty crest she shielded 
her eyes from the sun and peered 
down the other side. She found her- 
self looking at featureless grasslands 
which spread without interruption of 
the distant horizons. 

There was no village. 

S waying slightly with the shock. 
Dumbo glimpsed the movement 
of Carl’s faded pink shirt as he 
scrambled down the hill below her. 
He was heading towards an object 
which Dumbo’s first brimming 
glance had missed. It was as large as 
five or six cottages in a line, and 
the outlines were blurred with 
climbing grasses; but to Dumbo it 
lobked like a huge cylinder of black 
metal lying on its side at the edge 
of the plain. 

An inexplicable reaction made her 
look upwards at the sky, then she 
sank weakly to her knees. 



Carl reached the cylinder, confi- 
dently pulled open a door and 
vanished into the interior. Dumbo 
waited for him to reappear, wonder- 
ing numbly why the world had gone 
mad. Was she sick? Could that thing 
actually be a village? The heat of 
the blistering afternoon pressed in 
around her, making her head swim 
in a blur of marching colors. Unseen 
birds chittered continuously. 

Some time later Carl emerged 
from the cylinder with a box in his 
arms and came up the hill towards 
her. An instinct warned Dumbo it 
was now imperative to keep out of 
sight. She backed through the dry 
grass on hands and knees then ran 
down the faint path to the ford. 
Across the river she realized there 
was no chance of making it to the 
bend before Carl reappeared on the 
skyline. She threw herself into a 
mass of orange-colored scrub and 
crouched in the sudden privacy 
of tangled twigs and clattering 
leaves. 

Carl came down to the ford but 
did not cross. 

He upended the box, throwing a 
number of glittering objects into 
the water, then turned and went 
back over the hill towards the cy- 
linder. The objects flashed sunlight 
as they bobbed away on the current. 
Dumbo got to her feet, thankful for 
the unexpected opportunity to get 
back to the cottage unseen, but she 
was curious about the contents of 
the box. It was, she decided, worth 
one further risk. 

She ran downstream for a short 
distance for a closer look at the 
floating objects. They looked like 



102 



IF 




little glass boxes, each of which con- 
tained a small ball of some whitish 
substance. Clinging to projecting 
roots and leaning dangerously over 
the bank, Dumbo managed to 
snatch one from the warm, sluggish 
water. She examined it closely. The 
box was oblong, about as big as her 
hand, and the two smaller faces were 
of black, opaque material. It was 
too light to be glass and strangely 
cold to her touch. 

Inside the box, floating languidly 
in clear fluid, was a human eye. The 
red cord of the optic nerve snaked 
around it, terminating in a tiny silver 
plug. 

Dumbo hurled the box in the river 
and ran, doubled over, frantically 
whipping her head from side to side 
to fling thin nets of vomit clear 
of her huge, soft body. 

Ill 

I n the gray light of morning Dum- 
bo partially opened her eyes and 
smiled. This was the time she like 
best, lying in the dark warmth of 
her bed, before the unwelcome and 
unstoppable invasion of identity fill- 
ed the peaceful vacuum of her mind. 
She stirred contentedly and let her 
eyes open a little further. 

The bedroom ceiling looked 
wrong. 

Dumbo sat up in bed, knuckling 
her eyes fiercely. The ceiling was 
wrong. In place of the familiar white 
plaster was an expanse of riveted 
gray metal, more like part of a ship 
than a rural cottage. It was as though 
she had been moved into strange 
surroundings during the night but 



— she looked around — this wa- 
her room all right. All the simple 
items of furniture were in their usua^ 
places. 

She walked to the window am- 
looked out at the front garden, bu 
it too was wrong. 

The fence was still there, but no\ 
it was made of crude stakes am 
wire, and inside it there were m 
flowers. Her roses had been replacet 
by worm less clumps of dark gree; 
foliage. What was it David had said. 
You mean these green things? 

Dumbo brushed tangled hair awa> 
from her face and hurried to the 
children’s room, fighting down a 
sudden dread; but they were there 
as always, stretched on their beds 
in extravagant postures of sleep. 
She listened at the door of Carl’s 
room and heard his regular breath- 
ing. Her family appeared to be safe; 
but, as she glanced around the cot- 
tage’s central kitchen in the increas- 
ing daylight, she saw that the walls 
too had turned to gray metal. They 
had a patchy, slightly makeshift ap- 
pearance. 

Moving with quick, frightened 
steps in the crawling gloom, Dumbo 
went back to her own room, got into 
bed and pulled the sheets up to her 
chin. The first coherent thoughts 
came some time later, and with them 
the knowledge that the changes in 
her surroundings had been accom- 
panied by changes inside her head. 
She found herself able to think, to 
remember. 

7 am not on Earth. I am on an- 
other world which I reached by star- 
ship with Carl. 

/ do not live in a white-washed

stone cottage . I live in a house which 
Carl must have built from bits of 
the ship. 

There is no nearby community. 
There is only the hulk of the ship, 
and Carl' goes there when we need 
supplies. 

Dumbo’s mind had begun to work 
with a speed she found exhilarating. 
For years she had been trying to run 
in waist-high water, now she was 
reaching shallows, gaining speed, be- 
ginning to fly. Thought crowded 
upon thought, memory upon deduc- 
tion. 

Why did / not understand all this 
before? Easy — because Carl was 
giving me a drug. 

Why do 1 understand it now? 
Easy — because David destroyed 
the current batch of the drug. 

Why was Carl giving me the 
drug? I’m not sure. Could it be 
that . ! 

Dumbo tried to pull back from 
the mental precipice, but she was too 
late. 

Why the eyes in plastic boxes? In 
the river? 

S he dragged the bedclothes up over 
her face and lay without moving 
until the sun had risen and the boys 
were marauding noisily through the 
house, naked and shouting for break- 
fast. While she was cooking it, she 
heard Carl begin to move behind his 
door. Dumbo tensed up as he came 
into the kitchen; but he, at least, had 
not changed. She watched him move 
about the new, drab world, half ex- 
pecting him to look round through 
her at any moment and reach for 
the hypo gun. But his pale blue eyes, 



behind their flakes of glass, remained 
disinterested and impersonal. Dum- 
bo was relieved and somehow disap- 
pointed. After all, she was a woman 
— his wife. There ought to be more 
to it than this. They lived together, 
and she had given him children. 
Mysteries and horrors did not cancel 
out that sort of relationship. 

She set the table for breakfast, 
really seeing things for the first time, 
testing her new powers. The chairs 
were all of sleek weightless metal — 
that was because the* starship would 
have had chairs and they were easily 
portable; but the big kitchen table 
and cupboards were wooden and 
homemade. The range on which she 
cooked with a log fire had been 
fashioned from some kind of heavy 
machine casing, but the cups and 
dishes were beautifully styled in bril- 
liant, glass-smooth plastic. In a way 
she did not mind the changes, except 
for the fact that outside the window 
was a garden full of dark green 
things. She was going to miss the 
roses. 

“I’ve made your favorites this 
morning,” she said, carrying a smok- 
ing tray to the table. “Griddlecakes.” 

Carl stared down at them, pressing 
the back of his hand to his fore- 
head. “That’s great. That’s really 
great. My favorite breakfast every 
day — every God-damned day in 
life. You’re some cook, Dumbo.” 

The older boys giggled ap- 
preciatively. 

Dumbo opened her mouth to hit 
back, then realized it would have 
been a mistake. Carl always spoke 
to her like that, and she never 
answered back. That’s why she was 



104 



IF 




called Dumbo instead of . her 
memory baulked — could it be Vic- 
toria? Anyway, the point was that 
Carl acted as though he hated her, 
and this made the mystery of their 
past even deeper. Suppose the star- 
ship had made a forced descent on 
an empty world, with no hope of 
ever being found. Further suppose 
she had been the only woman on 
board, perhaps married to one of 
the crew, and Carl had murdered 
all the others so that he could have 
her. It might account for the use 
of the memory-killing, euphoria-pro- 
ducing drug — but it explained noth- 
ing else. 

The day was hot, sunny and un- 
eventful. 

Carl spent most of the time work- 
ing in his fields. Surveying her sur- 
roundings from the front of the 
house, Dumbo noted that the slop- 
ing grain fields had not been part 
of the fantasy world. She wondered 
if the crop was indigenous to the 
planet or if starships normally car- 
ried seed as part of a survival kit. 
Assuming the ship had been lost, they 
had been lucky to alight on this per- 
fect pastoral world — but perhaps 
it had not been that way at all. Carl 
might have abducted her and 
brought her here purposely, to es- 
cape from something. 

Dumbo contented herself with the 
task of caring for the children and 
the house. It was, after all, woman’s 
work. She could lie low for another 
day or two and, provided the drug 
had had no permanent effect, simply 
wait for all answers to emerge from 
her memory. And perhaps the ex- 
planation would be sane and rea- 



sonable, and things would be won- ' 
derful again. Dumbo began to feel 
hopeful. 

During the night she remembered 
her brother. 

IV 

C rossing the river in daytime had 
been easy, but by starlight the 
flat stones of the fprd were mere 
water-borne shadows of uncertain 
shape and position. 

Dumbo slipped once and went 
knee-deep in water with a splash. 
The noise frightened her. She stared 
about her in the darkness, suddenly 
aware that this was an alien world 
where at night even the vegetation 
might be hostile. The tree's not a 
tree , she remembered a stray line, 
when there's nobody there on the 
heath. 

Shivering unhappily, she stepped 
on to the bank and moved up the 
hill in the direction of the starship. 

The mental pictures of her brother 
had appeared abruptly. At first she 
had thought they might be of a hus- 
band — this tall, rangy, fair-haired 
youngster with the intelligent eyes — 
but the emotional response was 
wrong. She knew the way a woman 
felt about her man, the way she felt 
about Carl. There was an immediate 
affection and warmth here, but an 
indefinable sexual blankness, the 
drawing of a line which meant 
womb-sharing. The same flesh and 
blood. At that point the need to 
know more had become too urgent 
to resist. 

From the crest of the hill, the 
starship was almost invisible in the

darkness. As she walked down to it, 
dress slapping wetly on her shins, 
the ship’s outlines refused to be de- 
fined. It seemed to crawl on the 
ground, dissolve, shake like jelly, 
reach gleeful hands into the sky. 
Dumbo watched her own feet and 
kept walking until she was close 
enough for her eyes to map the hull’s 
contours. She had trouble finding 
the door; but once the handle was in 
her hand, instinct took over. The 
lever clicked sideways easily, and the 
door opened towards her. 

There was light inside. 

Dumbo sensed to run, but there 
was a cold stillness to the light which 
suggested that it always shone, even 
when there was nobody there to no- 
tice. She went up a narrow metal 
stair into a corridor which curved 
away for a short distance on each 
side, ending in featureless metal 
doors. The light came from a tube 
which ran the full length of the cor- 
ridor ceiling. Two sections of it 
were fainter than the others, and a 
third had dulled to a cloudy amber. 

Dumbo hesitated, then went to 
the right. Cold air puffed out around 
her as she opened the door. The 
large room beyond it was dimly lit 
and filled with rack after rack of 
transparent plastic boxes. Dumbo 
slammed the door shut but not be- 
fore she had glimpsed the rows of 
nameless organs — glistening brown, 
pale blue; red-veined. 

She pressed both hands to her 
lifting stomach and breathed deeply 
for a moment, snatching air. 

The other door opened into a 
shorter transverse corridor which 
led to several doorways at her level 



and, by way of an open metal stair 
and catwalk, to a similar set of rooms 
above. Some of the doors were 
closed, others lay open. Dumbo 
looked into the nearest room — it 
was tiny and contained a number of 
long, metallic objects on a stand. 
Rifles, she thought, feeling the vivid 
stains of memory flow into yet an- 
other compartment of her mind. She 
opened two lockers and found pistols 
and grenades. She touched the 
luminous dials of the grenades’ time 
fuses, frowning thoughtfully — it 
appeared that not all her regained 
memories would be pleasant. 

The second room along the corri- 
dor was larger and more brightly lit 
than the others. In the center of it 
was a long, white table supported 
on a single, complicated pedestal. 
Around the walls were gleaming, in- 
comprehensible machines and instru- 
ments, the sight of which failed to 
evoke any responsive wash of 
thought, even then. She closed the 
memory. I was a stranger here, she 
thought. 

N one of the others rooms on the 
bottom level were of interest, 
except the one which had obviously 
been a combined galley and mess. 
The chairs were all gone — they 
were back at the house — but one 
of the cupboards still contained cups 
and dishes. The sight of the familiar 
glowing utensils in the alien sur- 
roundings gave Dumbo a vague emo- 
tional wrench. 

On the upper level she chose the 
central room first. 

Her reaction to the five massively 
cushioned chairs and curving instru- 



106 



IF 




ment arrays was so strong that it 
caused a moment of nearly physical 
pain. She crossed the faintly lit room 
to touch the dusty seats and blank 
gray screens. I knew this place, she 
thought wonderingly, and yet it’s so 
. mechanical. Only a trained en- 
gineer could have been at home in 
this room. Could she have been a 
pilot? Dumbo turned her head to 
drink in more of the strange, yet al- 
most familiar environment, then she 
glanced over her shoulder. 

In the shadows behind the door 
stood five helmeted figures. 

She leapt back awkwardly, but 
the figures were only empty suits, 
clipped to the wall. Their hoses and 
cables hung loose, and behind the 
faceplates was nothing but gaping 
blackness. Two of the suits had tri- 
angular yellow flashes on the shoul- 
ders and name plates cemented to 
the chests. Dumbo went close 
enough to read. 

The first said, SURG./CDR. 
CARL VAN BUYSEN. That would 
be Carl, Dumbo thought, moving 
to the next. 

The second said, LT./CDR. 
ROBERT V. LUCAS. 

Dumbo pressed both hands to her 
forehead. The name Lucas meant 
something to her — but what? This 
could be' her brother’s suit, and if 
that were the case then one of the 
unmarked suits might have been hers. 
But there was something not quite 
right about the idea of brother and 
sister on the same military . 

“You haven’t been taking your 
medicine — have you, Dumbo?” 

The voice was Carl’s, and it came 
from close behind. 



Dumbo spun, arms over her face, 
but Carl had his hands in his pock- 
ets. He was smiling unpleasantly. 

“I have been taking it,” Dumbo 
blurted instinctively. “You gave me 
a shot yourself.” 

“Then you’ve been playing tricks 
with it. That’s bad, Dumbo, very 
bad.” 

Dumbo experienced a new emo- 
tion — resentment. “Don’t speak to 
me like that. And my name isn’t 
Dumbo. It’s . .” 

“Go on,” Carl said interestedly. 
“I want to see how far you’ve got.” 

“I don’t know. That part is harder 
than the rest . but it isn’t Dumbo. 
Don’t call me that any more.” 

“Poor Dumbo!” Carl reached for- 
ward caressingly, grabbed a hand- 
ful of Dumbo’s hair and twisted. His 
oval face was priestly with hatred. 
“Get back to the house,” he whis- 
pered. 

Dumbo sobbed with pain. “What 
did you do with my brother? And 
the others? You killed them!” 

Carl’s fingers relaxed their grip 
instantly. “You say that to me? You 
say that to . me!” He shuddered. 
“Carl is a gfver of life. Understand 
that. Carl is a holy giver of life. He 
has never killed anything.” 

“Then where’s my brother? And 
the others?” 

“Why should I have killed any- 
body?” 

“Because,” Dumbo said trium- 
phantly. “I was the only woman on 
the ship.” 

“You!” Carl stepped back slowly, 
appalled. 

“You wanted me to yourself.” 

“You’ll pay for saying that, Dum- 

107 



CALL ME DUMBO 




bo.” Carl raised his fist, then re- 
laxed it deliberately, one finger at a 
time. “Listen to me — you never 
had a brother. There was nobody 
on this ship but you and me. We 
were in the thick of a tactical emer- 
gency, so we tried to take the ship 
to Lark IV by ourselves. The suit 
you t were looking at when I came 
in was your own.” 

Dumbo looked at the stiffly lean- 
ing pressure skin with its black maw 
of a face and bodly stencilled name- 
plate. 

“But ...” 

“That’s right.” Carl laughed soft- 
ly. “Hello, Victor!” 

V 

S omehow, incredibly, Dumbo was 
not angry. Almost of their own 
accord her hands crept down the 
front of her heavy dress and cradled 
the sagging, scarred belly. Perhaps 
it was too soon for a reaction, per- 
haps when she had recovered all her 
past and was able to compare it 
with the present . 

“There had been a surprise at- 
tack in the region of Lark IV,” 
Carl was saying. “The losses were 
heavy, and Sector Command was 
screaming for medical support, so 
you and I tried to get through with 
an organ bank. We almost made it, 
but they hit us fair and square with 
a warp scrambler. You know what 
that means, Dumbo?” 

She shook her head. 

“I thought not, but you did then. 
For months after we limped down 
on to this world, you sat up at 
nights with the ship’s ten-inch scope 



trying to catch a glimpse of our 
home galaxy. You should have 
known better. You and I were a 
sitting on a billion-digit combination 
lock, and somebody had spun the 
wheels. Somebody with a bad memo- 
ry.” 

Carl pulled off his glasses and 
began polishing the lenses, blue eyes 
peering myopically into another ex- 
istence. 

“There we were on a completely 
empty world. A clean, .fresh world, 
ideally suited for life — and there 
was nothing for us to do but grow 
old and die.” Carl’s voice grew 
louder. “And Carl could not allow 
that. It would have been a terrible 
wrong — because the only obstacle 
standing in the way of Life was a 
few ounces of redundant male flesh. 

“I had everything that was needed 
— the organ bank was in good con- 
dition then. The individual power 
cells are failing now, and I’m dis- 
carding more and more units every 
week, but at that time I was able 
to produce a usable set of basic fe- 
male organs and glands for you. One 
hypno session after the operations 
and a weekly shot of an LSD deriva- 
tive took care of the rest. 

“That’s your illustrious back- 
ground. How do you like it, mother ?” 

Dumbo twisted the signet ring she 
wore on the third finger left hand. 
It turned easily on bearings of per- 
spiration, but she felt strangely un- 
touched, strong. 

“I’m sorry, Carl — you can’t pun- 
ish me like that. Don’t you see? 
The things you have just said might 
have destroyed Victor Lucas, but he 
can never hear them. He doesn’t 



108 



IF

109 




exist any more. I’m . Victoria 
Lucas.” 

Carl shivered in the cool stale 
air* “You’re right. My logical facul- 
ty must be getting rusty. The whole 
idea of punishment assumes con- 
tinuity of personality, and you won’t 
have that — not after your next shot. 
Are you going to walk back to the 
house, or do I drag you?” 

D umbo took a deep breath. “Why 
bother with the shots when we 
don’t need them? There’s no point 
in pretending all this has made me 
feel deliriously happy, but I can 
take tilings as they are, without the 
illusions. I ought to hate you, but 
you did too good a job on me with 
those glands. I really am a woman 
— and I’m prepared to go on being 
your wife.” 

Carl hit her back-handed, thick 
fingers hanging loose like flails. 

She dropped back against one of 
the control chairs and hung on to 
it, staring up at him in dismay. 

“My wife!” White coronas glowed 
around Carl’s eyes. “You freak ! 
You nothing! You think I ever 
touched you?” 

“I don’t remember ... but what 
then? Our children?” 

“ Our children!” Carl spoke eager- 
ly, suddenly seeing the potency of 
the new weapon. “Three nice kids, 
but what a family! You for a mother, 
and three unknown soldiers for fa- 
thers. You looked into the organ 
bank for a moment, didn’t you, Dum- 
bo? Recognize anybody?” 

The words took time to reach 
Dumbo. When they did she stood up 
and moved out past Carl. 



“That’s right, mother,” he whis- 
pered in her ear as she went by. He 
followed her down the metal stair 
towards the lower level. “But don’t 
take it so personally, Dumbo. There 
are sound genetic reasons in favor 
of the children having different fa- 
thers — it’s all for the good of our 
future community. Think instead of 
how lucky you are. Yes, lucky! No 
man could ever touch you and still 
keep his food down, yet, thanks to 
the wonders of medical science, 
you’ve had three children to as many 
different men. And you’ll go on 
having them, until you produce the 
girls we need.” Carl hung on to the 
stair rail so that he could watch 
Dumbo’s face while he spoke. 

“Of course, I was lucky too. A 
ship like this doesn’t carry frozen 
semen, you know. If it wasn’t f©5 die 
fact that the organ bank caters 'to 
even the most drastic type of injury, 
there would only have been me — 
and that really would have been a 
fate worse than death. 

“You hear me, Dumbo? Why 
don’t you say something?” 

Dumbo reached the lower level 
and passed the door to the longitu- 
dinal corridor. 

“Not that way, mother.” Carl 
caught her shoulder from behind. 

“She wrenched free and ran. Carl 
gave a startled grunt and came after 
her, his footfalls speeding up as he 
remembered the armory. Dumbo 
burst through the door, throwing 
herself towards the rifle rack. Carl’s 
hand raked down her back. She 
snatched one of the weapons by the 
barrel and swung it blindly, hoping 
to find Carl’s belly. He had fallen

forward on to his hands and knees, 
and the rifle butt opened his face 
like a purse. He rolled on to his 
back, unconscious, with a bright red 
bubble quivering at each nostril. 

Dumbo placed the rifle butt on 
his upturned throat and bore down 
with all the weight of her big, soft 
body. 

VI 

M orning sunlight streamed across 
the breakfast table, making 
it glow like an altar. 

Dumbo set out five dishes of hot 
porridge and went to fetch the chil- 
dren who were tumbling noisily out- 
side. She hummed quietly to her- 
self as she watched the boys eat, 
taking pride in the very smell of the 
good, simple food. As soon as she 
was sure the children had everything 
they needed, she loaded a wooden 
tray and carried it into Carl’s room. 

“Come on, darling,” she said 
brightly. “I know you don’t feel like 
eating, but you must make the ef- 
fort.” 

Carl sat up in the bed and touched 
his bandaged face. “What is this?” 
The words came slowly through 
swollen lips. 

“It’s your breakfast, of course. 
I’ve made your favorites today. Now 
eat up so you’ll get well quickly.” 
He stared up at Dumbo for a 
moment, then his face relaxed. 

“Well, I’ll be damned,” he said 
wonderingly. “I thought you were 
going to kill me, but you must have 
realized you couldn’t make out here 
on your own.” 

“Eat up, darling. Don’t let your 



breakfast get cold.” Dumbo fluffed 
up the pillows to support Carl’s back. 

Carl shook his head, chuckling 
.with relief. “Well, I’ll be damned. 
And you even had sense enough to 
go back on the shots.” 

Dumbo leaned down on the bed 
to get her face close to his. 

“Correction,” she said coldly. “I 
haven’t taken a shot. Not yet. I took 
a fresh lot of the drug from the 
store and primed the gun with it, but 
I haven’t taken the shot yet. I want- 
ed to wait.” She glanced at the watch 
on her wrist. 

“Wait for what?” Carl pushed the 
tray away. “What are you doing 
with my watch?” 

“I waited to see your face, of 
course. I could have taken the shot 
earlier, when you were still sleeping, 
but I would have become Dumbo 
again and wouldn’t have understood 
what was happening. Would I?” 

“Get off my bed,” Carl said thick- 
ly. “I’m getting up. Where’s the hypo 
gun?” 

“Don’t rush, darling.’’ Dumbo 
pushed him back on to the pillows. 
“Let me tell you what I’ve been do- 
ing while you were asleep. First of 
all, I brought you here from the 
ship, and that took ages because I 
had to drag you most of the way. 
Then I put you to bed and fixed 
your face and a little while ago, 
while the oven was warming up, I 
went back to the ship and . she 
glanced at the watch again, “. 
listen, darling.” 

Carl pushed her away savagely, 
using his knees. He half rose in the 
bed, spilling the food, then froze 
as the sound reached the house. 



CALL ME DUMBO 



111 




It was a distant multiple explo- 
sion. 

“What was that?” His shocked 
eyes hunted across her face. 

“That, darling, was your organ 
bank. I had no idea the grenades 
would make such a noise. I hope 
they haven’t worried the children. I 
must see how they are.” She paused 
at the door and looked back. 

Carl was kneeling naked on the 
bed. 

“Oh, yes,” Dumbo said. “I musn’t 
forget this.” 

She took the hypo gun from a 
pocket, fired the charge into her 



wrist and went out to the startled 
boys. By the time she had washed 
up the breakfast things and tidied 
the room, the walls no longer seem- 
ed like metal. She went to the win- 
dow and looked out. Her roses shone 
redly in the peaceful morning air. It 
was going to be yet another perfect 
day. 

Dumbo smiled as she watched the 
boys at play. She hoped the next 
child would be a girl because that 
was what Carl wanted more than 
anything else in the world. 

And all she wanted was to be his 
wife. END

IF m Short Story 



The 
Forgotten 
Gods of Earth 

by Andrew J. Offutt 

In the haunted caverns beneath 
ancient Earth he found an enemy 
that even he could not conquer! 



K ymon of Kir gazed up at the 
black castle towering into the 
dim sky, its turrets and minarets re- 
sembling dark fingers pointing the 
way to the forgotten gods of Earth. 
The Mother Planet of Man had 
come upon sad times, he thought, 
when she was reduced to scattered 
castle-keeps haunted by the ghosts 
of her illustrious history. Some said 
magic ruled Earth now; some said 
science, remembered by the sorcer- 
ers who made the Mother Planet an 
inhospitable place for all save them- 
selves. 

Inhospitable enough it was with- 
out the scientist-sorcerers, Kymon 



thought, a planet full of desolation 
and twisted black remains of once- 
was. The descendants of Earth call- 
ed her Atramentos, now, and shun- 
ned the blue-black ball circling tired 
old Sol. 

Kymon chuckled, the deep-throat- 
ed sound of a giant of a man from 
a barbarian land. Men called Earth 
“barbarian”, too, but not those who 
had visited his own dark Kir. If 
magic reigned here, only a Kirian 
could prevail, Kymon knew — and 
at that a Kirian with a goodly sword 
and the muscle to back it up. Well, 
he thought, soon the black mage 
Gundrun and all his demonic guard- 



113 




ians would go to meet the somber 
gods of Atramentos. Or he himself 
would. He loosened the pommel of 
his long glaive, Goreater, glanced at 
the ring on his finger and mounted 
the hill to the castle. 

A small man named Fejj had told 
him of the place. In the fabled Black 
Castle of Atramentos, he had said, 
lay the Princess Yssim, captive of 
the sorcerer Gundrun. A comely girl 
she was, with a body to bring fire 
into a man’s veins — or so she had 
been, when she had become Gun- 
drun’s prisoner. The oastle was ren- 
dered impregnable by his spells and 
his demons. The princess alone knew 
the whereabouts of the treasure- 
trove of the pirate Senek, destroyed 
these twenty years in the Coalsack. 
Gems and precious metals there 
were, Fejj had said in his narrow- 
eyed hiss, to ransom Emperor Titus 
himself. And Kymon had nodded 
and listened. The girl was merely 
sweetening to the spoils. 

A man such as Kymon did not 
go about rescuing women without 
good reason. Not, certainly, when 
they were so easily come by and, 
those of royal blood, notoriously 
spoiled and dangerous. 

O ver cups of wine in a dim tavern 
in Yttocs, on Sark, the two men 
had agreed to share the treasure. 
Then because Kymon was a barbar- 
ous Kirian and such men could be 
trusted to rely upon their muscles 
and ability rather than shrewd dou- 
ble dealing, Fejj had told him how 
to reach the place. He had told, too, 
of the power of the ring he wore; 
while it made no magic it negated 



all spells cast upon the wearer. Guns 
and science were of no value on the 
planet men once called Earth, he 
had said; only magic and copper- 
backed steel could prevail there. And 
Kyman had chuckled and showed 
him his copper-pommeled sword 
without telling him how he had come 
by it. Besides, he had reminded the 
little man, Kirians were not allowed 
guns anyhow. 

They had made their pact and 
left, coming by the passage-money 
the same way Kymon had got the 
sword. On the great ship slashing 
through space Fejj had said, “Few 
men would I trust with the knowl- 
edge I have imparted to you Kymon 
of Kir. But ’tis well-known that 
barbarians are not back-stabbers, 
and — ” 

And shortly after Kymon had 
been thus reminded that Fejj was 
no longer necessary, the little man 
had met with a terrible accident and 
had gone to repose in the ship’s re- 
frigerators until planetfall. Kymon 
found that the ring fit his little 
finger perfectly. 

Now, gazing up at the castle, Ky- 
mon chuckled again. The universe 
was full of stupid men, he thought, 
and the myth of barbarian honor 
served the men of Kir well. He set 
his foot on the hill on which stood 
the castle. 

The monster bird came winging 
down like a giant stormcloud heavy 
with rain, its leathery wings flapping 
with the sound of thunder. It paused 
above his head, steadying itself on 
wings the size of space-freighters, 
then folded them and careened down 
at him. 



114 



IF 




Full four bursts from the photon 
gun Kymon wasted on the bird be- 
fore 'he believed Fejj’s words and 
slung the gun away. Goreater ate. 
Clapping a hand over the scratches 
laying bare the great sheaves of 
muscle in his chest, Kymon looked 
down at the flopping body of the 
bird. It writhed even in death, some 
awlful virescent ichor bubbling from 
its neck. 

Then it vanished. 

“Steel backed by copper!” Kymon 
shouted and swished the sword joy- 
ously, spitting in the direction of the 
discarded pistol. Then he went on, 
paying little attention to the wounds 
in his big chest. They would heal, 
as had scores of others. 

A s he drew nearer he began to 
feel the strangeness of the 
place, the evil. Trailing tendrils of 
wraithy stuff like cobwebs seemed 
to writhe over his face. He blinked 
and shook his head and raised his 
hand to tear his way clear. But his 
hands touched nothing. There was 
nothing there; no cobwebs, no ten- 
drils, merely the eerie feel of them. 
He shivered. Neither man nor beast 
had been woman-spawned to strike 
fear to the big barbarian’s heart. But 
this palpable, evil which came of 
warlocks and shades, the forgotten 
shadow-world of necromancy and 
specters, that otherworld of appari- 
tions and divinations and things 
which a man could feel but not see 
. these brought a shiver to Ky- 
mon and set his teeth a-rattle in 
his head. He touched the ring, real- 
izing he had not used it, that he 
had fought and destroyed a sorcer- 



er’s demon with nought but his own 
thews and sword. 

But now fear laid on him fingers 
cold as the nordic winds of far-off 
Kir, tightened them about his heart. 
Again he shivered. He began to 
shake. He felt hot water and an 
atrabilous taste in his mouth and he 
turned away, whimpering, to flee 
down the hill. 

And then, his knees shaking, his 
hands chill and wet, he realized 
what was happening. He managed to 
mouth a foul barbaric curse despite 
the sorcery-induced fear which was 
attacking him. As if rooted in quick- 
sand he turned slowly back to the 
castle. He raised his left hand, aim- 
ing the ring at the misty towers. “I 
defy you,” he shouted, and thrice 
he repeated the words Fejj had 
taught him. And the ring seemed to 
come alive, to glow and shimmer 
and pour strength down his arm. 

Magic or ancient science, it was 
effective. The haze vanished. The 
ghostwebs ceased their invisible 
twisting. His fear left him. 

And there before him stood the 
black castle of Atramentos. 

No longer was it a shadowy thing 
of fear and unholy blackness; now 
it was merely a towering pile of 
blackest basalt, gleaming liquidly 
even in the moonless night. The door 
rose before him, twice his height. A 
chain with links thick as his thumb 
was looped through the door handle 
and secured to great spikes on either 
side. 

Growling low in his throat, Ky- 
mon drew Goreater. He sucked in 
a mighty breath and, laying hold of 
the pommel with both hands, he 



THE FORGOTTEN GODS OF EARTH 



T15 




swung the sword far back over his 
shoulder and brought it whistling 
down with all the strength of his 
corded muscles. Shock blazed up 
his arms like tongues of lightning. 
The sword rebounded and nearly 
took off his head. 

The chain held, rattling. 

Somewhere laughter rose to fill 
the air, a wind^howling cackle of 
glee and mockery. Kymon spun. 
There was nothing. Only the glist- 
ening Trinitite plain and the twisted 
remains of the civilization that had 
settled Kir, time out of mind. 

Kymon turned back to the castle, 
cursing. He bent to examine the 
door, chain, spikes . and saw that 
the spike on the left had been driven 
into the castle wall with such force 
that it had cracked the masonry. He 
smiled and sheathed his sword. Lay- 
ing hold of the chain and the spike’s 
head with both hands, he braced one 
foot against the wall. Then he drew 
a deep breath and yanked. 

There was no loosening, no grad- 
ual feeling of give. One moment he 
was tugging with all his strength, 
his body shaking with the effort. The 
next he was sprawling heels-over- 
head as the spike slid from the wall 
with a rattle of the chain and a 
crumbling of stone. Kymon picked 
himself up and stepped across the 
forlorn chain. He set a foot against 
the door and shoved. It swung in 
without a sound; he had expected 
a creak from the aged hinges. An 
odor of death and mouldering 
corpses rushed out to embrace him. 
With Goreater ready in his hand lie 
entered the murkiness of the entry- 
hall. 



'T'he serpent was almost upon him 
a before he knew of its existence. 
Its shimmering scales rose above 
him, its xaethic eyes gazed at him 
like the very fires of blackest hell. 
Far behind he could see its immense 
body stretching off along the hall- 
way. He sniffed tihe evil odor of its 
breath as it 'hissed, felt the blast of 
fetid air and hurled himself aside 
as the eyes blazed up like the coals 
of a stirred fire and shot forward 
at him. 

Kymon moved with a swiftness 
greater even than the reptile’s. The 
great head swished past. Goreater 
swished after it, bit into the back 
of its head with a chunking sound. 
The monster body shivered and 
lashed in the final torment of death 
as the head plopped to the floor and 
rolled away. It exuded a vast pool of 
nigrescent ichor. The last lash of the 
terrible tail caught Kymon just be- 
low the knees, sending him skidding 
and sliding along the floor to sprawl 
in a great room beyond the hall. 
Even as he came to an abrasive stop 
he saw the serpentine body shimmer 
and vanish. Somehow he clung to 
Goreater. 

And good it was that he did. 

“Black devils of Gnish!” he mut- 
tered. He got to his feet, crouching, 
aching and smarting from more 
than one abrasion. Here there was 
light, bathing the big room and re- 
flecting back from a gleaming floor 
of tesselated tile. Approaching him 
now were men who were not men, 
alive but not alive — creatures dead 
but not dead. Full half a score of 
them there were, bearing the gaping 
wounds that had been the violent 



116 



IF 




death of them. The eyes of one pop- 
ped wide, and his black tongue lolled 
forth as it had at the moment he 
had been slain by the reptile in 
some dark yesterday. They advanc- 
ed, creatures returned to life by Gun- 
drun’s evil spells, and Kymon saw 
himself mirrored in them. These 
were his predecessors; would-be he- 
roes who had come here on the same 
mission as his. Now clawed hands 
rose as they came jerkily at him. 

The first Kymon met with flash- 
ing sword to send his arm flopping 
away across the floor, black blood 
spattering forth. The fingers con- 
tinued to flex and clutch. The shriek 
ripped from the creature’s throat 
chilled Kymon’s very blood. But the 
howl and gore told him that though 
these men 'might be dead, they were 
alive, too, and could be killed . 
again. He hurled the thing aside, the 
scarlet stump of its arm pumping 
out pseudolife. 

And then Goreater was a flashing, 
live thing, spattering walls and ceil- 
ing and floor with the steaming crim- 
son wake of its terrible smiting. He 
ran a black giant from Tiamar 
through and through and yanked 
free the sword, feeling the dying 
man’s claws tear his arm as he fell. 
A smallish fellow Kymon seized and 
gripped by his heels and swung him 
in an arc to down one, two, three 
of the others. Then he released the 
man and heard the revolting popping 
noise as his skull burst against the 
wall and spewed forth rank red and 
gray. Whilst the others shrank back, 
checked by their awe, Kyman struck 
the heads from the three men he 
had downed. 



Kymon’s battle cry ripped from 
his lips as he spun to the man whose 
arm he had lopped off. The fellow’s 
head leaped to join his severed arm 
on the gore-slippery floor. He turn- 
ed in time to dodge an axe in the 
hands of a creature whose face was 
one great wound that had been -rip- 
ped and shredded in some bygone 
time by the monster bird outside. 
Kymon’s foot swept up and com- 
pleted the destruction of that dead 
face, crushing nose and teeth and 
bursting eyeballs from their sockets 
to sail like agates into the air. Blood 
bathed Kymon’s leg in warm sticki- 
ness. 

But four remained now, and Ky- 
mon roared at them to come join 
their comrades. They came, mindless 
things, restored but temporarily from 
the dead to serve as fighting ma- 
chines for the master of this castle 
of horror. The cry of the maimed 
and the dying was in Kymon’s ears 
and his veins, and his own battle cry 
joined them to spur him forward. 

They fell, gushing forth their car- 
mine juices, their souls leaping forth 
to meet their liberator, the flashing 
Goreater. And the awesome sword 
drank and ate; and once again these 
men died. The musty halls of that 
darkling castle reeked and smoked 
with blood and gore, rang with the 
fearsome cry of the big barbarian 
from the mountains of far Kir, with 
the dying cries of those sent to de- 
stroy him. 

A nd then he stood alone. His nos- 
trils flared as he stood panting, 
surrounded by the corpses and heads 
and limbs no longer joined one to 



THE FORGOTTEN GODS OF EARTH 



117 




the other. His feet were planted in 
curdling blood. Their blood and his 
dripped from his hands, trickled 
warmly down his bare legs. 

Deliberately, with the unconcern- 
ed industriousness of a woodsman 
cutting trees, he hacked the heads 
from those not already beheaded. In 
the event he failed, Gundrun would 
no longer use these men who should 
long ago have been walking the 
afterworld with the shades of their 
friends. 

He bellowed out his rage and his 
challenge. 

“Gundrun! Blackest creature on 
Earth’s face — resurrector of slain 
men! Gundrun! Your oversized spar- 
row died outside — your swollen 
fishing worm in the hall — and at 
my feet lie ten heads severed from 
their decomposing bodies! Gundrun, 
commander of the legions of hell! 
Whiat else send you to meet Kymon 
of Kir?” 

His voice ran down empty halls, 
dashed into dark empty rooms and 
out again, slashed through the thick 
webs of long undisturbed spiders and 
set them a-tremble, rose up the long 
stairway before him, shouted back 
at him from shroud- draped walls of 
shiny basalt. 

He waited. Again he filled his 
lungs to roar out his challenge, again 
he flung wide his jaws to shout. 

Then at the * head of the steps 
stood Gundrun, black sorcerer of 
Atramentos. 

His eyes blazed down at Kymon’s 
as had the dead serpent’s. A slender 
nose arced out between those eyes, 
hooked like the beak of the prodi- 
gious bird. Below that nose writhed 



tendrils of mustache like the fear- 
wraiths that had touched Kymon 
outside the warlock’s lair. And be- 
low the mustache was a lipless slash 
of a mouth, resembling nothing more 
than the old wounds of the dead 
men at Kymon’s feet. His body was 
lost in a long, ungirt robe of unre- 
flecting black. 

4 4 ymon of Kir, is it?” Gun- 
^ drun asked, and he laughed, 
and Kymon knew then the .source 
of the disembodied laughter he had 
heard outside. “And you have de- 
stroyed my guardians and penetrated 
to the very marrow of my keep! 
Well Kirian, well-met! Join me here, 
mightiest of men, that I need fear 
no more such intrusions. Be my 
guardian of the Black Castle!” 
Kymon’s eyes glittered like the 
bubbling tar pits of Midaldithon as 
he stared back at the thaumaturge. 
“Join you, Hell-creature? Live here 
as guardian of this tomb? I love life 
too much to live here with death!” 
Gundnin’s drooping mustaches 
wriggled like tentacles, and his mouth 
pretended to smile. He waved his 
hand, tracing invisible patterns in 
the air. And the air was filled with 
the golden glow of a thousand lights; 
the birdsongs of lutes and the belly- 
booms of drums and the ululating 
skirl of pipes. A vision of the finest 
of succulent foods from every gal- 
axy, the richest wines served in au- 
reate goblets. There were pillows of 
the softest fabrics and hues. And 
there were women; slender girls with 
breasts round and cupped as the 
goblets, eyes telling of love and de- 
sire, hips churning and yearning to- 



lls 



IF 




ward him. And there were others, 
too, deep-chested women with caver- 
nous dark navels winking in their 
round bellies and bronzed arms to 
crush a man in their embrace. Ky- 
mon gasped; they were Kirian wom- 
en! Women of ihis own world, their 
eyes for him and him alone, their 
bodies coppery chalices of sensual- 
ity. Kymon saw, and his great sword 
was forgotten in his lifeless hand 
as he started toward them with eyes 
like those of the dead-alive men he 
had slain. He dropped the sword, 
raised his hands. 

And the vision flickered and fad- 
ed. Only for a moment did it pale, 
then it began to return in full color 
and sound and promise — but in 
that brief failing of Gundrun’s 
powers the mists faded from Ky- 
mon’s eyes and brain as if dissipated 
by the morning sun. Again his eyes, 
clear and blazing, glared up the 
steps at the black-robed man. 

“Gall you this foul illusion life? 
Call you the world of men shallow? 
Nay, sorcerer — it is your necro- 
mancy which is shallow! Your spell 
has but reminded me of what will 
be mine when I return to Kir a 
rich man. Your world is death, and 
I am here to see that you join the 
other dead things in it!” He frown- 
ed, slowly lowered his head to fol- 
low the sorcerer’s gaze. And then 
he knew why the illusion had flick- 
ered, why Gundrun stared, why 
there was the hint of fear in his 
eyes. Kymon was looking down at 
the ring. 

He scooped up his sword and 
set a foot upon the steps, -grinning. 
And then Gundrun raised his arms, 



wrists like clean-picked skeletons 
emerging from loose black sleeves. 
Blue light flickered and danced at 
his fingertips. In that instant that 
he stiffened his arms, pointing his 
talons at the barbarian, Kymon flung 
up his hand and pointed the ring. 
He shouted, three ringing times, “I 
defy you!” 

Lightning leaped from Gundrun’s 
fingers. Down at Kymon it crackled 
in sizzling streams of cobalt blue. It 
flashed before his face so that he 
winced and closed his eyes against 
its searing glare. But he felt nothing; 
nothing save the power and strength 
coursing down his arm from the 
ring, shaking him as his voice had 
shaken the dusty cobwebs. 

H e opened his eyes. All around 
him shimmered the blue-siz- 
zling lightning, but it was checked, 
held at bay by the power of the 
ring. With a wild roar he hurled 
himself up the stairs, holding the 
ring 'before him and swinging up 
Goreater. His war cry filled the air. 

“When came you by that accursed 
ring?” Gundrun shouted, and fear 
shrilled his voice. “The ring of Br 
— it negates my mag — get back — 
NO!” 

Gundrun of Atramentos died, 
screaming and waving his skeletal 
arms as Goreater bit through his 
skull and forehead and nose and 
mouth and neck and was covered 
to its copper hilt with spurting blood. 
Kymon left the body where it lay 
and bounded back down the steps. 
He waded again through the noisome 
river of gore with its islands of 
headless corpses. He rushed down 



THE FORGOTTEN GODS OF EARTH 



119 




one dim corridor and up another, 
leaving scarlet prints in his wake. 
Then 'he found the huge brass-bound 
door Fejj had described. 

Goreaiter’s first bite split it in 
twain. Kymon jerked back the hing- 
ed half and descended into darkness. 

And descended. He counted to 
ten and folded down a finger and 
began again, and then repeated the 
action. 

There were nine-and-forty steps, 
seven times seven, taking him far 
into the earth. Yet somehow the 
air remained fresh, although it grew 
steadily cooler and damper. He 
stalked forward into the gloom, 
wishing he had brought a light. But 
ahead was a glow. 

He rounded a corner into light, so 
sudden and bright that he squinted 
and put up a hand before his eyes. 
Then he swung up his dripping 
glaive as he saw the man. 

He wore arms and armor, the 
nosepiece of his helmet making his 
face a sinister mask. He raised a 
hand in command to halt, then car- 
ried it quickly to his mouth as he 
sneezed. Kymon grinned, an ugly 
animal-baring of his teeth. Well he 
recalled his sojourn in such a place. 
Dungeons were universally damp 
and chill. But there was no time for 
commiserating with the fellow’s dis- 
comfort. 

Kymon raised his sword and start- 
ed toward the small man. 

e man’s hands sprang to his 
buckle, let belt and sword and 
pistol clang to the dewy floor. 

“Thank the gods!” he said nasal- 
ly. “You’ve come to rescue the 



Princess Yssim — and me! Two 
years have I remained down here, 
locked in, held here by locks and 
iron of sorcery. Photon beams had 
no effect on his locks. Guard he 
called me; unwilling warder have 
I been, bearing food and water and 
occasional wine to the poor girl 
here.” He stepped back and extend- 
ed his arm, offering Kymon a ring 
bearing one huge key. “It will not 
open the door,” the man said. “Gun- 
drun has sealed it with his spells.” 

Kymon sheathed his sword and 
took the key. “It will now,” he said. 
“Gundrun and his spells have gone 
to meet Lilith and Satanas.” In the 
light of a score of ancient globes, 
fed by some forgotten science or 
magic in this chthonian place, he 
peered into the barred cell. 

She was beautiful. Her hair was 
liquid gold, flowing down over her 
shoulders to cap arms round and 
snowy white. Her bosom was to the 
liking of any man; it was big, Kir- 
ian-big and swaying and shuddering 
beneath the shift with her excited 
breathing. The dirty shift she wore, 
he saw more with interest than com- 
passion, was too thin for the chill 
dampness of her prison. Her eyes 
swept his tall figure. 

He bent to the lock, his eyes shad- 
ed by their lids, still on the girl. She 
was a trifle pale — but he was not 
looking at her face. “A man named 
Fejj sent me hither, princess. He 
said you alone knew the where- 
abouts of some treasure . which I 
promised to him. I came here only 
to rescue you from that villainous 
Gundrun. But I have found my 
treasure ...”

IF 




She nodded silently, seeming not 
to hear his words. Her eyes were 
bright on the lock. “Ah!” she 
breathed, as the keys clicked and he 
swung open the grille. She stood 
within, lovely and fair, and Kymon 
thought that never had he seen such 
a comely woman. He held out a 
hand. She came toward him — 

— and past. He turned to stare as 
she fairly hurled herself into the 
arms of her guard. 

Kymon sighed. Well, the fellow 
had said he was her unwilling gaoler, 
and he had mentioned two years. 
In that time a man and a girl who 
had seen no one else might certain- 
ly grow to love one another. Kymon 
flexed his weary muscles. But such 
a man! He sighed again, licking his 
lips as he watched the little guard 
drink the nectar from Yssim’s lips. 
Well, there was still the treasure. 

At last they drew apart, and, after 
gazing long down into the man’s 
eyes, Yssim turned to her rescuer. 
“Sirdh and I can never thank you 
enough, O hero. Who are you? 
Whence came you?” 

“My name is Kymon. I was born 



on Kir, but it has been long since 
I have felt the sun on her moun- 
tains.” 

“We are your slaves, Kymon of 
Kir.” 

“I have no need of slaves,” Ky- 
mon said. “But . Fejj mentioned 
that you had knowledge of a great 
treasure, the horde of Senek. Per- 
haps ...” 

She smiled. “Aye! The- treasure 
trove! Enough for you and me and 
Sirch and Fejj; enough for a score, 
a hundred! The space pirate Senek 
did indeed bury it on Earth. Tis a 
big planet, but we need not search. 
It is not I who possess the secret of 
its whereabouts, Kymon; ’tis Gun- 
drun. He alone knows the secret. 
You have conquered his guardians 
and his keep; now we shall wrest 
the secret from him!” 

Kymon stared unbelievingly at her 
for a moment. Wrest the secret 
from the lips Goreater had cleft in 
two? 

He began to curse . and at last 
to laugh and, laughing, turned to re- 
trace his steps to the open sky, and 
space. END

S oon the firemen had a water 
supply again. Wisely they first 
doused our own side of the river. 
The powerful jets of the two engines 
could reach practically every build- 
ing on this side without having to 
move. 

For the first time I had a good 
look at the blocked New Bridge. It 
was badly damaged and twisted, yet 
after the fire it might remain service- 
able as a bridge, once the debris on 



it had been cleared. It was all too 
clear, however, that there was no 
chance of clearing it while the fire 
still raged. Some of the stones were 
still glowing red, and there was 
smoldering wood in the pile. In any 
case, I estimated that without bull- 
dozers it would take a hundred men 
two days to clear the bridge. 

Without bulldozers .... We were 
in farming country, and although 
all the resources of Shuteley itself 
were on the other side of the river, 
there were plenty of farms this side.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



In the little town of Shuteley, England, on the hottest summer of 
any residents memory, a party of visitors appeared. They were all 
young, and they were enormous. Moreover, they had a couple of 
traits that startled the quiet people of Shuteley. The girls in the party 
wore dresses that dieappeared from time to time; and all of them had 
an unusual knowledge of what was happening in the town . and 
what was about to happen. 

The giants had established a camp on the bank of a river outside 
of Shuteley. Val Mathers visited their camp to satisfy his curiosity. 
Then, suddenly, incredibly the whole town went up in flames. And 
Val's company insured all of Shuteley! 



I raced to a callbox. There was 
one among the sheds not a hundred 
yards away. I picked up the receiver. 

As I might have guessed, it was 
dead. The exchange was in Shuteley. 
In any case, water, debris and heat 
must have put the overhead wires to 
the box out of service long since. 

There was a callbox about a mile 
back, and it might be working. Say- 
ell should know about communica- 
tions. Probably, I realized, he was 
in constant radio contact with his 
headquarters. 

I ran back and tried to talk to 
him. But he was busy and waved 
me away. My suggestion about the 
brook had enabled him to be busy; 
he was quite certain, however, that I 
could not repeat the triumph. 

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



The fire hoses had been turned 
across the river, and rather unex- 
pectedly they had made some im- 
pression. On the other side a fairly 
large semicircular area was free of 
fire, partly because nearly every- 
thing that would burn was already 
consumed, certainly everything high- 
ly inflammable, and partly because, 
being next to the river, its mean 
temperature was not as high as 
areas in the center of the holocaust. 
The water as it fell still rose in 
clouds of steam in places, but as the 
cooling jets played everywhere the 
glow of heat was fading, and the red- 
ness of everything visible was now a 
reflection of the flames still leaping 
farther back. 

Indeed, the eye had now become 

123 



used to the overall redness and can- 
celed it out. Just as, when one wears 
dark glasses, it is possible after a 
while to see colors as they really 
are. Everything was red. But blue- 
red didn’t look the same as green- 
red. 

There was less smoke than I’d 
have imagined. Although my eyes 
stung and watered all the time, that 
too could be ignored, like the various 
smells; and for a long time I had 
not choked, coughed, or been out 
of breath. I suspected that there 
must, after all, be a slight breath 
of air away from us. Perhaps it 
was a breeze created only by the fire, 
sucking air from our side. 

The firemen were not attempting 
a desperate enterprise. Now that 
there was ah apparent toehold across 
in the blazing town, one of the 
engines was going to attempt to 
cross the dry river bed. 7 

P ersonally I thought the attempt 
was several kinds of a mistake. 
The last few minutes had shown 
that the two engines, given an ade- 
quate supply of water, could accom- 
plish something from this side of 
the river. They had won back a little 
from the fire. And even if it was 
scorched earth that they gained, an 
area that the fire had finished with 
and no longer wanted, even if the 
area represented only a fraction of 
one per cent of the total area of 
Shuteley, the process could be re- 
peated. Unfortunately there was no 
road along this side of the bank, 
but the engines could travel along 
the lanes and reach the bank from 
other vantage points — the one from 



which we had first seen the fire, for 
example — and do what they had 
done here. 

The ladders could be used to en- 
able water to be sprayed over a 
wide area on the other side. Of 
course it would turn to steam. But 
that was all right; it took about six 
times as much heat to convert water 
to steam as it did to raise it to boil- 
ing point. 

Also I thought that it was too 
soon to attempt to cross to an area 
which had so recently been red with 
inner heat. Water falling on hot 
stone or metal draws off surface 
heat, but the glow wells up again 
to the surface. I doubted that even 
the firemen in their asbestos boots 
could stand anywhere across the 
river yet, and I was quite certain 
that the rubber tires of the machines 
would be burned off them in sec- 
onds. And although the heat here 
was just bearable (because we had 
to bear it), we had been insulated 
all along by the breadth of the river, 
which, though dry, had never burn- 
ed. Across the river the firemen 
would be on ground, which had 
only recently been surrendered by 
the flames, and that much nearer 
the heart of the blaze and its fierce, 
searing heat. 

Besides, I didn’t think the ve- 
hicles had one chance in a hundred 
of making the crossing. They were 
ordinary fire tenders, designed rather 
for getting to the scene of an out- 
break at top speed than crossing 
impossible terrain. They might cross 
grass or rough country, but they 
weren’t tanks or tractors. They had 
four rubber-shod wheels (intact, 



124 



IF 




true, because someone had had the 
sense to shield the vehicles with wet 
tarpaulins), and they were heavy. 

The bed of the river was a U. Not 
a deep U, for the Shute was never 
deep, not even where it ran into the 
much larger river that flowed on to 
the sea. Yet the Shute was no brook. 
It had flowed steadily along the 
same course for thousands of years, 
millions for all anyone knew, and the 
bed had gradually deepened, silted 
in the middle, perhaps, but with ever- 
steepening outer walls. 

Even if a tender could drive down 
one side of the bank and cross the 
swampy bed, could it ever get up 
the incline on the other side? 

I was certain it couldn’t. 

SayelJ, however, was determined. 
He wasn’t going to wait, either. A 
dozen men were stamping along the 
bank, grassy here, trying to estab- 
lish where best to make the at- 
tempt. 

A fleeting thought occurred to me. 

Sayell was probably no fool, 
even if his brother was. He was 
probably reasonably well trained in 
fire-fighting techniques. But he was 
no genius, and the situation which 
faced him had never faced anybody 
before. 

Fires don’t wait for the experts, 
the bosses, the generals, politicians 
and scientists to turn up. In an hour 
or two this area would be swarming 
with people ail of whom could have 
handled the situation better than any 
of us, between cups of tea. I remem- 
bered, irreverently but not irrelevant- 
ly, how Gulliver put out the Lillipu- 
tians’ fire. Some man-mountain 



could have done the same for us, if 
only he happened to be there. 

Unfortunately, we were right out 
of man-mountains at the present 
time. Chance had elected poor, hon- 
est, not-too-bright John Sayell as 
the man in charge. 

I knew already that he’d be pillor- 
ied. Whatever he did, he should 
have done better. If Shuteley was 
annihilated — and anyone from this 
side of the river could see it al- 
ready was — well, he couldn’t have 
done worse. 

But he still didn’t have to com- 
mit the criminal irresponsibility of 
staking all on the impossible, thus 
abandoning the small, yet important, 
things which were possible. 

I strode through his crew. “Say- 
ell,” I said. 

The look he turned on me was 
that of a tortured man. “Mr. Math- 
ers,” he said, being civil with an 
enormous effort, “you’ve done two 
good things tonight. You found a 
water supply, and you got your wife 
to clear the bystanders out of our 
way. But now we have to — ” 

“Now you have to do the right 
thing,” I said, “because there’s no- 
body else to do anything. Have you 
checked the footbridges?” 

He said a coarse, derisive word. 
“They’re wooden,” he said. “What 
chance have they? For God’s sake, 
man, get out of my way.” 

“For God’s sake, man,” I said, 
“remember that you didn’t think it 
worthwhile looking at the Winsihell 
brook.” 

That didn’t reach him. Debating 
points don’t register when you’re in 
the glare of disaster, when you only 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



125 




have to turn your head to see it. 

“There’s the fire,” he said. His 
voice, I noticed for the first time, 
was raw. He had been shouting. 
“We’re going to put it out. Please 
let me get on with it, Mathers.” 

As he dropped the “Mr.” for the 
first time, his self-control broke 
again, and he nodded. “Out of my 
way, man! Or by God I’ll knock you 
senseless with my axe.” 

I stood back. Perhaps I should 
have fought with him, tried to de- 
pose him as overlord of the tiny, 
laughable army which was the only 
weapon with which the Great' Fire 
of Shuteley could be fought, at the 
only time when it mattered, when 
something still might be done. 

But what was the use? He knew 
something about fighting fires. And 
I, apart from fire risk, knew noth- 
ing. I had failed long before Sayell 
had a chance to fail. It was up to me, 
indirectly and yet significantly, to 
do all I could to see that something 
like this could never happen in 
Shuteley. 

A few years ago, a few months 
ago, even a few hours ago, I could 
have saved hundreds of lives which 
had now ended. 

M y thoughts stopped there. In a 
disaster such as this, there 
comes a time when you have to 
count the cost, but it’s only natural 
to delay it as long as possible. 

In the back of my mind I had 
thought all along that I wasn’t really 
here. 

I don’t know what happened. May- 
be there was a small fire among 
ithe timbered houses on the green. 



Maybe people stood around watch- 
ing it, until it spread and they had 
to move away. Maybe it was gradual, 
quick but steady, and every area was 
cleared as the fire took over. Maybe 
nobody died in the fire. If it was 
steady enough in growing, that could 
happen. 

There must have been a lot of 
noise. People couldn’t have missed 
what was happening watching TV, 
because quite early on the electricity 
must have gone and all the TV’s 
must have gone off. 

Dina would have been one of the 
first to know what was going on. 
She must have enjoyed it. A magnifi- 
cent bonfire, the greatest spectacle 
she had ever seen. 

Dina, I suddenly realized with 
utter certainty, had escaped the dis- 
aster. Despite her feeble-mindedness 
(I used the brutal expression for al- 
most the first time, because at such 
a time the natural tendency was to 
print everything bold and clear) 
she had the kind of abilities, physical 
and mental, which would make her 
The Most Likely Person to Survive. 
She would enjoy a fire, untouched 
by tragedy, uninterested in its wider 
significance . but the moment 
the fire seemed to be getting out of 
hand, she would know, with animal 
cunning (after all, compared with 
even the most sagacious animal she 
was a genius), that now was the time 
to go somewhere else. And she was 
supremely capable of doing it. She 
didn’t smoke, didn’t drink, didn’t 
overeat or take drugs, and had never 
been ill in her life. Nobody in the 
whole of Shuteley could get from 
one place to another quicker than 



126 



IF 




Dina once she had made up her 
mind. 

Dina was alive and well (even if 
Miranda couldn’t be trusted). 

Sheila, I knew, was alive, well, 
and not even scorched. 

Gil, Jota, Miranda — the other 
people I cared about — were prob- 
ably all right too. Miranda would 
certainly be all right. She was with 
the giants. I hadn’t had time to 
think much about the giants since I 
was driving back from the road- 
house, but I took it for granted that 
none of them had suffered in the 
slightest degree in the fire. It was 
our affair, not theirs. Somewhere 
they were standing outside it, watch- 
ing, enjoying the fun. 

So, selfishly, I tried to put the 
disaster in proper perspective. For 
me it could have been a lot worse. 

Yet Sayell was sending the first 
of his tenders across the river, and 
that bothered me. To do the man 
justice, he leaped on it as it reached 
the bank at the selected place. Ir- 
rationally, like all good commanders, 
he wouldn’t send his men where he 
wouldn’t go himself. 

The tender rushed down the in- 
cline. Still, the spot had been chosen 
carefully and sensibly. The vehicle 
stayed upright, it managed to slow 
(by gears, not brakes, I guessed) at 
the bottom and started the crossing. 

There was irony and tragedy in 
what happened to it then. Comic 
tragedy, I guess, if a town had not 
been burning to death only a short 
distance away. 

What looked like reasonably solid 
mud on the left side of the engine 
was merely earth mixed with water 



in misleading proportions, if you 
judged simply by Hie eye. 

The tender keeled over on its 
side and commenced to sink in the 
mud. 

XXI 

N obody was hurt, except in spir- 
it. The firemen, mud-covered 
scarecrows, clambered bkck up the 
dry river bank. Sayell saw me and 
set a course that would take him as 
far as possible from where I was 
standing. I could do him a big favor 
by ceasing to exist. 

The tender in the river bed, of 
some value just a few seconds ear- 
lier, was now so much junk. And 
the other tender could accomplish 
just half what had been possible a 
couple of minutes ago. 

I knew how Sayell felt. In the 
face of disaster, continuing disaster, 
you had to do something. You had 
to try anything that might do some 
good. If it failed . well, you’d 
tried. 

I left the group of firemen, know- 
ing that if there was somewhere 
where I could be useful, it wasn’t 
there. Sayell wouldn’t listen to me. 
He was on a razor’s edge. The fact 
that I had been right two or three 
times and he had been wrong would 
make it utterly impossible for me 
even to get him to listen to me 
again. 

Sheila wouldn’t need help with the 
children and old people over the 
hill. She was young and strong and 
didn’t dither, and in emergency any- 
one old or young would be glad to 
obey such a leader. It was when peo- 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



127 




pie hadn’t a leader, or only a quasi 
force-of-circumstance , unconfident 
leader like Say ell, that everybody 
ran about like frightened hens. 

I moved back the way 1 had come, 
along the river behind the huts. Since 
there was nothing particularly useful 
I could do this side of the river, I 
should get across to the other side. 
Although I couldn’t cross where I 
was, and would die if I did, it would 
be necessary to go only a few hun- 
dred yards in either direction to be 
able to cross either the bed of the 
river or the river above the obstruc- 
tion. 

There might, I thought, be a 
chance of clearing the blockage 
which had dammed the river. That 
would certainly help, if it could be 
done. A river running past a fire 
like this was better than a dry bed. 
At the very least, it was a firebreak. 

I wasn’t really thinking, merely 
reacting as a human animal. Most 
other animals would have put as 
much distance as possible between 
them and the fire, but as a human 
being I had to sniff round the con- 
flagration and see if there was any- 
thing to be done. 

Some events are numbing, like a 
blow on the head which doesn’t put 
you out but leaves you staggering 
through pain and nausea and dizzi- 
ness and momentary blackouts. This 
was one. If you stared at the fire 
. well, you couldn’t do it for long, 
and th^re was really nothing to see 
but glare and smoke and flame and 
horror, if you let your mind analyze 
what you were seeing. But anyway, 
after you’d had a glance or two 
across the river, you realized that 



you couldn’t afford to watch the 
fire. 

It was hypnotic as well as terrify- 
ing. There was flame motion, smoke 
pattern, that caught you and held 
you like the one movement in an 
utterly still scene. Your eyes could 
water and smart, but a second would 
grow to a minute, ten minutes, and 
it would be an instant. 

To retain the power of movement, 
the power of action, you stopped 
looking across the river. 

I knew perfectly well that if I 
wanted to find people who had es- 
caped from the blazing town, if I 
wanted to know how it happened, 
I should go the other way, down- 
river. Practically all the roads and 
lanes and other escape routes came 
out that way. Upriver on this side 
there was nothing but the track that 
led to my house and then curved 
away from the river to a few farms, 
and on the other, Castle Hill and 
a rubbish dump. 

But the giants were upriver. 

I n retrospect it’s strange that the 
giants and their part in what was 
going on could be practically ignored 
for so long. 

Obviously, as I’d said to Sheila 
on that mad drive back to Shuteley, 
they were in this business up to their 
necks. At the least, they had known 
what was going to happen. At most, 
they were entirely responsible for 
it. 

Yet if somebody starts a fire, a 
little fire that can destroy only a 
single house or a farm, if somebody 
standing beside you strikes the match 
and fires the hay, you don’t go for 



128 



IF 




him. Your first move, instinctive 
and correct, is to deal with the fire. 
Coldly, logically, it might be valid 
to go for the fire-raiser, to make 
sure he does no more damage. 

But the fire-raiser might do no 
more damage anyway — and the fire 
already exists. 

The giants were still at the back 
of my mind, with what might well 
become known as the Great Fire of 
Shuteley taking all my attention. 

Then, as I passed a gap through 
which the scene across the river 
could be glimpsed, I saw something 
that brought the giants right back 
into the picture. 

It was one of those snapshot im- 
pressions you get as you pass the 
end of a lane, or a window, or a gap 
in a hedge. The brain takes the snap- 
shot like a camera, the picture re- 
maining often sharper and clear 
than a scene you’ve viewed for ten 
minutes. 

Between me and the dull embers 
of a building across the river which 
could burn no more, I had seen one 
of the giants — over there. He was 
tall and blond, but he was not Greg. 
He wore what looked like a plastic 
coverall over a hump on his back. 
His eyes were hidden behind thick 
dark glasses. ' 

The whole thing was so much like 
something in a horror film that I 
paused for a few seconds before go- 
ing back, refusing to believe I had 
really seen him. 

No one could live over there. No 
one could breathe. Certainly no one 
could walk in any kind of footwear 
I could imagine, because the ground 
was red hot. And a plastic spacesuit 



would shrivel up instantly like a 
fertilizer bag thrown into an open 
fire. 

I jumped back, after that moment 
of disbelief, but of course the giant, 
even if real, was past my narrow 
angle of view. I burst through to the 
riverside, and there was nobody to 
be seen. 

Yet I had seen him. The clear 
picture in my mind had beaten back 
the disbelief. He was neither Greg 
nor any of the giants I had con- 
sciously looked at. The picture didn’t 
fade. I could still see it. Shutting my 
eyes, I could even notice things I 
hadn’t noticed before. 

What had looked like a hump 
must be the breathing apparatus 
which made it possible to walk 
through fire. The giant had been 
hurrying, not quite running, carry- 
ing nothing in his hands, under his 
arms or on his shoulders. He had 
worn a transparent plastic covering, 
enclosing his head and all the rest 
of him. Under the covering he seem- 
ed to have nothing but the hump. 
He was either naked or nearly so. 
Colors of things seen in such a set- 
ting could be anything at all, since 
yellow-orange-crimson flame filled 
the sky. 

And one thing more — he had 
not meant to be seen. You only 
have to glimpse an incompetent 
amateur sneak-thief for a moment 
to realize he’s up to something and 
doesn’t want to be observed. There 
had been something similar in the 
way the giant was hurrying. Possibly 
an obstruction had forced him to 
skirt the river for a few yards, visi- 
ble from the other side. Deeper in 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



129 




the blazing town, he could not have 
been seen. Flames and smoke, if 
nothing else, would have swallowed 
him from view. 

Although he had been hurrying 
downriver, back the way I had come, 
I didn’t change my mind and go 
that way. If he really existed, if his 
incredible fire-suit really worked, 
no doubt he could walk through the 
middle of the fire as easily as he 
could skirt the edges. The people 
downriver would not see him, if he 
didn't want to be seen. 

I went on. If one of the giants was 
wandering alone through the blazing 
town, the rest of them might be do- 
ing the same. 

Including Miranda. “I think I’ll 
be seeing Dina,” she had said. “We’ll 
do something.” 

She had also said: “No, I shan’t 
see you again, Val.” 

Maybe she was wrong. 

W hen I saw the blockage it was 
clear that explosives were go- 
ing to be needed before the river re- 
turned to its usual course. 

Shuteley Castle had stood on 
Castle Hill, the one piece of high 
ground on the north side of the 
river, just above the Old Bridge. A 
ridge ran along the south side, but 
on the north, only at the eastern 
extremity of the town did the ground 
rise to any height. There the castle 
stood. Or had stood. 

It had glowered across the town 
from a curious round mound which 
looked so artificial that historians 
argued about the possibility that 
Saxon serfs had piied Castle Hill 
high with only picks and shovels. 



Anyway, the fire had spread 
round the bracken which fringed 
the hill. It seemed that the bracken 
itself had held up the hill, for when 
it was gone, the castle and most of 
Castle Hill had collapsed into the 
river, taking the Old Bridge with it. 

Above the obstruction, the river 
tumbled into a hole which had not 
been there before, making a small, 
but quite impressive waterfall before 
dashing itself against the huge mound 
of rubble which was all that remain- 
ed of the castle and the hill on 
which it had stood. The river tried 
to climb over the mound, which was 
ten feet too high, and then took the 
path of considerable, but least, resis- 
tance and streamed off southwards 
in about a dozen rivulets through a 
gap in the south ridge. 

Until then I had not worked out 
that I’d either have to cross this side 
of the obstruction or cross twice, 
first the diverted river and then the 
river itself. 

I didn’t like the look of the streams 
rushing behind the ridge. They were 
shallow but very fast. It would be 
impossible to keep my feet if I 
tried to wade through, and when 
water flings you about you’re liable 
to crack your head on a stone. 

It would be hazardous to try to 
cross the river bed on the west side 
of the mound of rubble, because it 
was steep and very loose. And back 
the way I had come the heat across 
the river was too fierce. Only close 
to the blockage, where what re- 
mained of Castle Hill afforded some 
protection from the heat, and where 
there was nothing left to bum, cross- 
ing might be possible. 



130 



IF 




So I started picking my way across 
the obstruction itself. 

After I’d gone about ten yards, 
climbing toward the top of the 
mound, I found I couldn’t go back. 
Loose earth and stones were sliding 
down the slope under my feet, and 
the best I could do was slip two 
feet back and gain three. If I tried 
to go back, I stood an excellent 
chance of being buried alive. 

I had a moment of sheer panic as 
I neared the peak of the mound and 
the rubble sliding beneath me threat- 
ened to sweep me off on the dry side 
of the blockage. I saw myself falling 
about fifty feet over rubble which 
would come with me, almost certain- 
ly burying me beyond any hope of 
rescue (if I happened to be alive 
when I reached the bottom) and far 
beyond any possibility of digging my- 
self out. 

I fought against the slide, running 
against it like a man on a treadmill 
over a precipice. The light was tricky, 
and my sense of direction was not 
all it might have been. The glare of 
the fire cast long, moving shadows; 
smoke stung my eyes, and on the 
other side of the mound the dark- 
ness was so intense that I couldn’t 
even see the white water. 

I overdid it. 

O ne moment I was fighting clear 
of the drop into the dry bed. 
The next I was teetering over black- 
ness, flicked by spray from the block- 
ed river below. And all the time the 
rubble beneath me cascaded this way 
and that, now into the dry bed, now 
down the slope to the south bank, 
now into the foaming river. 



Suddenly there was nothing be- 
neath my feet at all. Then I was in 
water. Then the whole world ex- 
ploded. 

I came to soaked, cold, shivering, 
with an aching head and the rush of 
water in my ears. For a moment 1 
was blind. 

Dazed and deafened, I neverthe- 
less realized where I was. I 'was 
somewhere in the middle of the delta 
of streams rushing into the blackness 
of the south side of Shuteley. The 
water rushing past me was not more 
than a few inches deep. 

It seemed to take a long time be- 
fore I worked out what to do and 
where to go. The huge mound of 
debris in the river bed cut off all 
heat and so much light that I found 
it hard to recover any sense of direc- 
tion. And after being toasted for so 
long I could have sworn the water 
all round me was only one degree 
above freezing point. 

At last I realized that if I forced 
my way through streams flowing 
from left to right I must come to dry 
land. Then all I’d have to do was 
cross a normal river that didn’t 
know what trouble it was going to 
run into farther on. 

I got across the streams somehow 
— and then couldn’t find the river. 
I seemed to be in a kind of marsh 
with rivulets running in all direc- 
tions. Only the glow of the fire, cut 
off by the pile of rubble which had 
stopped a river, enabled me to find 
my way back to the bank of a more 
or less normal Shute. 

I made my way along the bank. 

Dizzy and with a head which 
seemed to be cloven in two, I shied 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



131 




away from the very thought of at- 
tempting to swim across the river. 
I’d probably be swept down to the 
whirlpool which had already knock- 
ed me silly. The Shute had always 
been a placid river, and in this hot 
summer it had been more placid 
than ever. But any river becomes 
angry if it’s balked and not allowed 
to follow the course it has taken for 
centuries. 

Presently, stumbling upriver, I be- 
came aware that one of my discom- 
forts had gone. I was still soaked, 
but I was no longer shivering. It was, 
as usual, a hot night. 

My house ought to be visible in 
the reflected glow. Yet it wasn’t. 
Ahead of me, nothing was visible. 

This was very strange. By com- 
parison with the glare behind me. I 
was walking into darkness. Neverthe- 
less, the red glow, the heat of which 
I could still feel on the back of my 
neck and through my wet clothes, 
should have lit up the river ahead 
at least as far as my house. 

And ahead there was nothing. 

I sniffed, and not because I 
smelled something. Quite the reverse. 
There was a sudden startling absence 
of smell. I was puzzled as a sleeper 
awakening to silence is puzzled, be- 
fore he realizes that a clock has 
stopped. 

Voices upriver gave me a clue. I 
had moved into a region of odorless 
vapor which didn’t sting the eyes, 
had no smell, and cut visibility. I 
moved on. The voices grew louder. 

Then I stopped. 

I had almost reached my house. 
It was invisible, but it could be no 
more than a hundred yards away. I 



had followed the river to the copse 
— and there, just in front of me, 
was a bridge where there had never 
been a bridge. And there were peo- 
ple on it, crossing from the other 
side to the copse. 

Not for the first time that night I 
acted without thought. I went closer, 
but along the bank, stealthily. I 
slipped silently into the water. Cau- 
tiously, carefully, I paddled under 
the bridge. 

The people I had seen on the 
bridge were giants, in' plastic suits 
with the hump I had already no- 
ticed, and baffled, bedraggled, fright- 
ened people who could only be refu- 
gees from the Great Fire of Shute- 
ley. 

XXII 

T he bridge was as startling in its 
way as luxon. 

It was only a catwalk perhaps a 
foot wide with two rails three feet 
apart. There were no supports and 
no reinforcements of any kind. It 
lay across the river like a plank, but 
I felt it, pushed against it, and it 
was solid as a rock. 

There was little or no risk that 
I’d be seen under the bridge. The 
smokescreen or whatever it was that 
the giants were using as cover cut 
visibility very effectively. It was not 
like fog or mist. You could see ten 
yards very distinctly, twenty to 
thirty yards vaguely, and beyond that 
was blackness. Sound, too, was 
muffled. 

All the giants wore plastic suits 
and small, quite neat boots. Under- 
neath they all wore as little as possi- 



132 



IF 




ble, but nevertheless seemed to be 
bathed in sweat. 

The dark goggles their eyes would 
need in the center of a conflagra- 
tion were folded down across their 
chests. Wearing them, out of the fire, 
they would be blind. 

The others, the people who had 
come from Shuteley, wore a simpler 
sort of plastic suit, loose pants and 
tunics which, unlike those of the gi- 
ants, were thrown open. Instead of 
the hump the giants had, they had 
merely a small black box apparently 
stuck to the inside of the plastic. 

I thought suddenly of Jota and 
his part in all this. Had the giants 
recruited him, or was he lying 
drugged in one of the tents at the 
camp? 

Miranda was not among those I 
saw. 

Vague recollections of time sto- 
ries I had read raced through my 
mind. Of course, I had never taken 
time travel seriously. It was the kind 
of thing which, if it ever happened, 
was never likely to impinge on me 
and affect my life. 

One of the assumptions made in 
such stories suddenly assumed 
significance. You couldn’t steal a 
man from the past, because of the 
effect his disappearance would have 
in his future, your past and present. 
But a man whose life was over, 
through accident — a man about 
to be destroyed in an explosion, 
buried for ever by an avalanche, en- 
gulfed in a mine disaster — such 
a man, on the point of ceasing to 
exist, could be plucked from his 
time without affecting subsequent 
events significantly. 



Was that what the giants were 
doing? 

I wanted to hear what was being 
said, and that posed a problem. In 
the river I was too near the flowing 
water to be able to make anything 
, out, and if I crawled up the bank, 
the giants coming along the other 
side and crossing the bridge might 
see me. 

So I drew back a little and swam 
across the river far enough down- 
stream to be invisible from the 
bridge. As I neared the other side, 
the bank, though not high, had me. 
Then I crawled along the bank un- 
til I was under the north end of 
the bridge, still hidden by the bank, 
and pulled myself partly out of the 
water. 

I heard: “Well, you'd be dead 

otherwise ." 

“But what are you going to do 
with us? Where are we going?” 

“You'll be safe." 

“This is the Mathers place. 
Where’s Mr. Mathers?” 

“In his house asleep.'' 

“My wife! What about my wife? 
I haven’t seen her since — ” 

“She'll be all right." 

“I don’t want to go. I want to 
go back and . .” 

The giants’ voices were slightly 
muffled by their suits, but on the 
whole easier to make out than those 
of the frightened, anxious, shocked 
refugees. I could hear only snatch- 
es, of course, as people passed over 
my head. 

“We’ll never get back?” 

“You'll be well looked after. 
Think of it this way — you're going 
to heaven." 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



133 




“Heaven?” 

“To you it'll be heaven . Nobody 
with a choice would stay here” 
“What do you want us for? Did 
you start the fire?” 

“No, we didn't start the fire” 
“Why did you take us past Castle 
Hill and the dump? There was no- 
body there.” 

“We didn't want to be seen. If it 
meant being seen, we couldn't help 
you” 

“My Moira ... I saw her catch 
fire. I’ll never forget her scream. 
She blazed like 

“We saved you, didn't we?” 
“Why couldn’t you save Moira?” 
“Others were looking. People who 
aren't here. We couldn't let them see 
us” 

And then again: “This must be 
the Mathers place. Where the insur- 





ance manager lives. Is he in this 
somehow?” 

“He couldn't be more out of it” 
“You mean he’s dead?” 

“ Just dead to the world” 

T he conversation went on, and I 
strained my ears to hear it, but 
the two who were talking were half- 
way across the bridge now, and it 
was another snatch of talk I heard. 

“What happened to the fire bri- 
gade? Why didn’t they . .” 

A very common word on the lips 
of these poor bewildered survivors 
was “why.” If they didn’t ask why 
God had permitted such a disaster, 
they asked why they had escaped, 
why others hadn’t escaped, why the 
strangers, if they could do so much, 
couldn’t do even more, like putting 
out the fire. 



From the giants’ replies it was ob- 
vious that to them, as to Miranda 
before I managed to get through to 
her, the people of Shuteley were 
little more than characters in a play, 
The answers were quiet, soothing, ap- 
parently truthful as far as they went, 
which wasn’t far. 

“Where did you come from?” 

“You'll see ” 

“You’re the kids that I saw in 
town yesterday, aren’t you?” 

“Yes” 

“If I thought you had anything 
to do with the fire ...” A stream 
of invective followed, empty, hope- 
less obscenity, for the man who was 
speaking knew perfectly well he 
could do nothing but curse. He 
couldn’t even fight the giants or re- 
sist them. The giants, girls and boys, 
had spread themselves out among 
these refugees to prevent protest or 
rebellion. 

I realized that there were a great 
many more of the giants than I had 
ever seen, far more than there could 
have been at the camp. I had not 
known of more than about a score 
of them. There must have been at 
least forty crossing the bridge, not 
counting any who might have cross- 
ed before I arrived on the scene. 

I knew from the snatches of con- 
versation I heard that the giants had 
been careful to be observed by no 
one who was going to live through 
the fire. They had led these people 
through the fire, in their simpler 
fire-suits (probably simpler so that 
they could be put on quickly and 
with no risk of mistake), and by a 
route chosen to avoid being seen. 
The crowds of people who must 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



135 




have escaped the fire would not 
gather about the northeast end of 
town at the rubbish dump, but at 
the other end, where the roads were, 
and the straggling cottages which 
must have escaped the fire, and the 
nearest farms. That could have been 
confidently predicted. 

Presently the procession ended. 
There was a gap, and then three 
more figures appeared, two huge, 
one small. 

They were Greg, Wesley and Mi- 
randa. 

Wesley reached the bridge, just 
above me, and spoke. 

Oddly enough, it still surprised me, 
after all that had happened, that the 
giants’ language, when they were 
speaking to each other and not to 
us, was not the English of the mid- 
20th century. It was English, and 1 
could understand most of it by lis- 
tening to the sense rather than the 
sound. But many of the words were 
not quite right, several of the vow- 
els had changed, and since the speech 
was colloquial there were many 
phrases that were hard to figure out. 

What Wesley said, roughly, was: 
“That’s . (the lot?) now. We’ve 
left nothing but the stasis and the 
two ...(?) in it. Who’s going 
back?” 

“I am,” said Greg. 

“We’re both going back,” said 
Miranda. 

I couldn’t see Wesley, but I sensed 
his uncertainty. “Okay,” he said, 
after a pause. “I’ll go on and tell 
them to ... (?) everything but the 
stasis, is that right?” 

“And the stasis just before dawn,” 
said Miranda. 



“Sure. You’ve got to be there 
then. If you’re not — ” 

Greg said a word which was en- 
tirely new to me, and yet the mean- 
ing couldn’t have been more obvious. 
The politest translation would be, 
“Go away.” 

Wesley went away, crossing the 
bridge and disappearing into the 
copse. 

M oving slightly, I could see Greg 
and Miranda quite well, for 
they had stopped short of the bridge 
and were not looking ‘at it. Keeping 
my eyes on them, I could duck out 
of sight at any moment before I 
could be seen, if they turned their 
heads. 

They wore suits exactly like the 
others. The briefs they wore under- 
neath seemed to be pink or gray. 
Seeing them both running with 
sweat, I wondered why they didn’t 
take off their plastic suits or at least 
open them up. I also wondered why 
a technology capable of constructing 
flimsy suits which could withstand 
the highest temperatures couldn’t go 
a step farther and make them com- 
fortable as well. 

Miranda said: “Let’s go back, 

then.” 

“And wait till dawn?” 

“Yes.” 

Greg laughed. “So that you can 
keep your eye on me, darling. Wait- 
ing for a wrong move.” 

“The next wrong move,” said 
Miranda steadily. 

He laughed again. “You idiot,” 
he said. “You’re all idiots, you and 
the others behind this . .(?). When 
you found you couldn’t keep me out 



136 



IF 




of it, you should have canceled it. 
You knew I’d kill it.” 

“We knew,” said Miranda, and I 
heard the defeat in her voice. “But 
you might fail. Lots of things might 
have happened. Maybe they still will. 
Jcyta might have — ” 

For the third time, irritatingly, 
Greg bellowed with laugher. It was 
the laughter of a vandal, a spoiled 
kid with an inflated idea of his own 
value in the world. It was the laugh- 
ter of a bully. 

“Jota,” Greg said, “has a little 
talent. I have the Gift. Nevertheless, 
Jota may be as important as you 
think. I think he is. That’s why I 
had to see that your plans for Jota 
didn’t work out.” 

“Greg,” said Miranda quietly, 
“listen to me for a minute. Please 
listen.” 

“Go ahead. There’s plenty of 
time. I’ll listen.” 

“You’re not necessarily bad. You 
never had a chance. That sounds 
trite, and it is. You were not only 
bigger and ... (?) and better-look- 
ing than anybody else, as far back as 
you can remember, but when girls 
began to interest you you didn’t 
have to bother to be nice to them 
or even go to the trouble of deceiving 
them. You had it all! You’ve often 
thought , about how you’re different 
from ordinary people, Greg. Have 
you ever thought about how ordi- 
nary people are different from you?” 
This time Greg didn’t laugh. He 
was interested enough to let her go 
on. 

And as I waited, rather chilled by 
the water in which I was partly im- 
mersed, I felt for a stone or a stick. 



Whether Miranda was on my side 
or not, I couldn’t be on Greg’s side. 
It couldn’t be a mistake to take 
Greg if I could. 

4 4T)eople who haven’t the Gift,” 
JT Miranda said, “have to learn 
to coexist. When they’re babies they 
know instinctively that they have to 
get and keep their parents on their 
side. As children they know that 
other children may * sometimes be 
rivals, but they have to be allies too. 
So what you never learned was — ” 
Greg bellowed again. “Is that all? 
I thought for a moment you had 
something to say. Now listen to me. 
First, take off that suit.” 

“I can’t, I have to go back and — ” 
“You’re not going back, darling. 
Not to the stasis. Not across the 
bridge. Not anywhere.” 

I might have moved then, but 
with a silent suddenness which 
startled me so much I almost cried 
out, the bridge above me winked out. 

It just wasn’t there. It didn’t burn 
or fade or shimmer or flash. It 
simply ceased to exist. 

Although probably both Greg and 
Miranda noticed this out of the 
corner of their eyes, neither bother- 
ed to look. Which was just as well, 
because I might have been slow in 
ducking out of sight. 

Miranda took a step back and 
turned as if to run. Greg reached 
out casually with his long arm and 
tumbled her to the ground. 

Standing over her, he said: “But 
before I kill you, darling, I want to 
tell you that things couldn’t have 
been arranged better if you’d let me 
plan them all myself. The stasis goes 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



137 




just before dawn, right? Just before 
dawn you’ve got to get those two 
out and get back in yourself, right? 
They’re left alive, here, and you’re 
safe back home, right?” 

“Yes,” said Miranda. 

“There are two spare suits in the 
stasis so that you can get those two 
out, rigjht?” 

“Yes.” 

“Wrong. They’re gone.” 

Miranda sat up quickly. “I watch- 
ed you all the time — ” 

He laughed. “I know you did. So 
I got Wesley to shift them. He 
wasn’t keen, but he didn’t want to 
die. So he . .(?) for me.” 

“He’ll know ...” Miranda be- 
gan and stopped. 

“He won’t know anything. He 
has no idea what the suits are for. 
But that’s not all. Suppose I just kill 
you here and now, swim across and 
tell everybody you went back by 
yourself?” 

I didn’t fully understand all this, 
but from her startled gasp it was ob- 
vious that Miranda did. It was as if 
she had allowed herself to be locked 
in a dungeon of death, as part of a 
plan, and then felt in her pocket and 
discovered she didn’t have the key. 

Greg couldn’t let it go. He had to 
savor his cleverness to the full. 
“They’ll believe me They’ll have to. 
You know that anything I say is the 
truth — always has been the truth. 
All I’ve ever had to do is go into 
any . (?) office and make a 
statement. Whatever I say, it has to 
be the truth. Otherwise — ” 

She leaped from under him and 
ran like a deer. Greg lunged after 
her. My hand forced, I scrambled 



up the bank and went after them. 
In my right hand I held a heavy 
stone. 

They could both run much faster 
than I could. I’d have lost them in 
the strange mist that hid the bridge. 
But only a hundred yards away, 
the mist ceased to exist. And I came 
on Greg and Miranda, only six feet 
from the river, with Greg again 
standing over Miranda. 

I let fly with my stone. It caught 
Greg full on the back of the head, 
and he staggered. His legs collapsed 
under him. He pitched right over 
Miranda and landed on the other 
side of her. 

We could have escaped if we’d 
been quick enough. But Miranda 
stared up at me in surprise, astonish- 
ed to see anyone at all, more as- 
tonished to see me. And I coughed 
as a cloud of smoke swirled round 
me — out of the giants’ protective 
mist, I had forgotten to be careful 
how I breathed. 

Greg was up. He lashed out at my 
head, and although I escaped the full 
force of the blow, I went down 
heavily. The next second Greg had 
Miranda in his grasp. Holding her, 
he made a quick pass at me, and 
something stung my eyes. 

I couldn’t move. I could see and 
hear, I could move my eyes and, 
with an effort, my head. But that 
was all. 

CCTTThat went wrong, Miranda?” 
VY Greg asked, looking down 
at me. “Why is he here?” 

“I don’t know. I left the . .(?) 
in the house, below the bottom shelf 
in a cupboard. It was set slow-to- 



138 



IF 




limit, short of death. Anybody in 
the house should have got sleepy 
very gradually, and then — ” 

“So it didn’t work. Or he went 
out too soon. It doesn’t matter. Take 
off your suit, Miranda.” 

“No.” 

“Take if off. I’m going to take him 
into Shuteley, in your suit. Then I’ll 
open it.” 

I didn’t shudder, because I 
couldn’t. 

Picturing what was going to hap- 
pen to me (walking through an in- 
ferno, unharmed, and then a 
wrench as the plastic suit was torn, 
then. .) I must have missed some- 
thing. A moment later Greg was 
saying: 

“I want you, darling.” 

“Don’t try to be funny.” 

“I’m very serious. There’s nothing 
more important in the world to me. 
I want you, here and now.” 

Incredibly, Miranda, who had 
been standing up to him, opposing 
him, arguing with him, was as weak 
and pliable as if under hypnosis. 

Well, was that it? Hypnosis? 

“I thought . .” she said, visibly 
struggling. 

“You thought after that one time, 
when you resisted, and I let it go, 
that you could stand against me. 
That I didn’t want you. That you 
still had some authority over me. 
That for some reason, any reason, I 
was never going to claim you.” 

He laughed. It was a forced laugh. 
There was no mirth in it. And I re- 
alized now that Greg’s laugh was al- 
ways forced, completely lacking in 
real enjoyment. 

At once, as if he had never laugh- 



ed, he went on fiercely, malevolently: 
“I set you up, darling. For when I 
wanted you. And the time is now.” 

There was a brief pause. Then, 
slowly, reluctantly Miranda touched 
her plastic suit at several points, at 
the throat, at her waist, at her knees. 
It split and fell off her, and the box 
at the back came with it. So did the 
boots, which were part of the^ suit. 
So did the dark goggles. 

Like an automaton she stepped 
closer to Greg. 

And he hit her. 

I’d never seen such a blow. At 
the very least he was twice her 
weight. He hit her as a very large 
man could have hit a rather small 
child, but perhaps never had in hu- 
man history; surely even a human 
beast would find it impossible to hit 
someone so much smaller so hard. 

Her feet left the ground. She 
would have been thrown several 
yards anyway. As it was, she sailed 
far out over the river, unconscious 
before she touched the water, and 
was swept away. 

She was possibly dead before she 
landed. In the river, unconscious, 
she would drown. 

Greg was satisfied. He scarcely 
glanced at the river. Instead, he bent 
to pick up her suit. 

Straightening, he looked down at 
me. Greg must be used to looking 
down on people. Yet he still seemed 
to enjoy it immensely. 

“I’m a little sorry for you, Val,” 
he said, in ordinary English. “You 
didn’t know what you were up 
against — despite knowing Jota. 
Miranda knew.' Wesley and all the 
others knew — especially the giris. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

of course. You didn’t you poor fool. 
If you’d stayed quietly at home to- 
night, you’d at least have lived. 
Miranda left a sleep cylinder in the 
house to make quite sure, because of 
what we had to do here.”” 

He shrugged. “You needn’t worry. 
I won’t open your suit until we’re 
right in the middle. You’ll scarcely 
feel a thing. It’ll be over in a sec- 
ond.”

don’t think Greg hit me again. 

I had been drinking at the road- 
house, not enough to show, but 
enough to know I’d been drinking. 
What had happened since would 
have made me stone cold sober if 
I’d had ten times as much, yet the 
residual alcohol in my system was 
one thing. The shock of what had 
happened was another. Then, the 
constant blast of heat from the blaze 
across the river must have done 
something to all of us, though since 
it was constant we soon ignored it. 
I had fallen into the river, hit my 
head and got water in my lungs. 
Greg had hit me and thrown a par- 
alyzer of some kind at me. 

It could have been all that which 
had suddenly caught up with me. In 
any case, the next I knew I was 
being led through the fire. Dazed, 
I hardly knew whether I was dream- 
ing or not. Certainly only in dreams 
could I ever have experienced any- 
thing remotely like this before. 

In spite of the goggles over my 
eyes, the flames were still blinding 
until the eyes adjusted. Greg, at my 
left side, grasped my arm tightly, 



half leading me, half carrying me. 
And we moved through a vast fur- 
nace. 

The suits were totally efficient. 
They completely screened all heat, 
and the air I breathed was pure. No 
smoke stung my eyes or throat. 

Yet it was an ordeal of terror. 

There was nothing to be seen but 
living flame and smoke. Frequently 
the ground writhed with liquid fire 
— blazing oil, tar or anything which 
liquefied in extreme heat. The con- 
fidence I soon acquired in my suit 
and boots — which fitted surprising- 
ly well — did very little to still ter- 
ror of the unknown. 

I was lucky, I suppose, that I 
was too dazed to think properly. I 
had that this can't be real feeling 
that makes people capable of things 
otherwise utterly beyond them. 

It also prevented me from having 
to fight or at least resist Greg. He 
had just murdered Miranda and had 
every intention of murdering me at 
any moment in a particularly horri- 
ble way. I should have done some- 
thing, though Greg could kill me 
quite easily simply by abandoning 
me. 

But the feeling that this wasn’t 
really happening made it possible 
to play along with it. At the moment 
Greg was helping me. 

The vagueness did not prevent me 
from remembering afterwards the 
horror of a fire that consumed not a 
building but a whole town. 

I saw only some of what the fire 
had done, and I was glad of it. 

One single impression summed it 
up. 

The damage to property was noth- 



140 



IF 




ing. Houses could be built again. 
Cars in the street had melted into 
red puddles. That was unimportant. 
But too often, no longer in the cars, 
because the cars no longer possess- 
ed any “in,” there were relics of hu- 
man beings, who had not, even in 
presumably efficient vehicles, been 
able to escape what was happening 
round them. 

In a way it was all clean and an- 
tiseptic. Fires are clean. A fire like 
this was cleanest of all fires. There 
was no blood to be seen, no skin, 
no guts, nothing unpleasantly ani- 
mal like that. The fire had taken 
care of all such things. There would 
be no plague after the Great Fire 
of Shuteley. The fire had been too 
efficient for that. Anything organic 
within the inner area had perished 
forever. 

The crowning horror was the 
mound of blackened bones. 

I wouldn’t have seen it if it hadn’t 
been in an area (where in the town 
I hadn’t the slightest idea, for noth- 
ing was recognizable) which must 
have buried early and was therefore 
totally consumed. Around it the fire 
still raged, but here there was near 
blackness. Even the tar in the streets 
had been burned, and the stone 
merely glowed darkly. 

And in the wreckage of a col- 
lapsed building was a vast mound of 
skeletons. There seemed to be thou- 
sands of them, but there were prob- 
ably only hundreds. 

For one wild moment I wondered 
if the giants had collected all the 
victims they could find and dumped 
them all together in one refuse heap 
of human remains. I almost hoped 



this was so. But it couldn’t be. These 
were the victims of a single disastrous 
incident in the general horror. This 
was not the total toll, only a single 
part of it. 

A large number of people must 
have been together somewhere in 
the town when the fire caught them. 
They must have died quite quickly, 
or the pile of bones would not have 
been so neat and compact. 

Only the impression, the picture, 
registered at the time — but it reg- 
istered for life. It was something I’d 
never forget. 

It was only then that I started to 
hate the giants. What kind of beings 
could have known this was going to 
happen and not tried to avert it? 

A wareness came back gradually, 
but rapidly, and it was to some 
extent retrospective. 

I knew I had reached a haven of 
peace and coolness in the heart of 
the fire, which was still blazing all 
around me, but as if behind glass. 
But what was I doing in a haven? 
Greg had brought me through the 
fire: I knew that. He had meant to 
tear my fire-suit at a spot where the 
temperature was instantly lethal: I 
knew that too. Yet I had come 
through the fire, with Greg. 

I became aware, with some sur- 
prise, that I wore only my under- 
pants. The fire-suit I had been wear- 
ing had been removed. It lay on the 
ground beside me. I now under- 
stood why the giants wore little or 
nothing under the suits. The suits, 
light and not elaborate, could be ef- 
fective only if they were utterly im- 
pervious to heat, a complete barrier 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



141 




to it. If they let any heat through 
at all, they’d b? useless in such a fire. 

It was beyond even the giants to 
construct a suit which would stop 
heat coming in and let body heat out. 

So you stewed in your own juice. 

Greg was with me, he was talking 
to me, but the sense didn’t register 
yet. Apparently realizing this, he 
stopped. 

He had thrown a gas capsule at 
me, or something which had a sim- 
ilar effect. Apart from that moment 
when my eyes smarted, there were no 
painful effects. But although I could 
move, although my mind could regis- 
ter some things, it couldn’t sort them 
out. 

I glanced around. 

We were in a huge hemisphere 
of no-fire, entirely surrounded by 
fire, in an area in the town which I 
couldn’t place. It was flat, and the 
ground was plain, scorched earth, 
with few stones and no debris. In 
the center was a dome, a curious 
object. It was a plain hemisphere 
15 feet high, as smooth as ice but 
of no material I knew. The faint 
silveriness suggested metal, the trans- 
lucency glass, the milky opaqueness 
plastic. One thing was clear: since 
it stood in the exact center of the 
cleared space, and since the dome 
of no-fire was exactly the same 
shape, one followed from the other. 

The air was cool and fresh, with 
no smell of burning. A faint breeze 
from the center of the stasis — 
there was no doubt that this was the 
mysterious stasis I’d heard about — 
confirmed that the machine there 
was air-conditioning the sanctuary. 

Above the hemisphere, as well as 



around it, flames and smoke swirled 
up into the night sky. Indeed, there 
was no sky to be seen at any point. 
The flames were so fierce that they 
completely submerged the dome. 

“The village green,” Greg was 
saying. The effect of the capsule, or 
whatever it was, was wearing off. 
“Incidentally, there are a couple of 
people you know here.” 

“Why didn’t you kill me?” I 
croaked. I wasn’t grateful. You 
don’t have to be grateful to a man 
for not killing you. Yet through the 
haze I was curious. 

“You’ll die anyway,” he said. 
“Without this you’ll die.” He picked 
up the suit. “Without it you can’t 
get out of here.” 

Yet he had suddenly become less 
certain, less confident. 

And as I recovered further, I 
said: “I’m not down on fate’s list, 
is that it? You couldn’t kill me? It’s 
not on the cards?” 

“There isn’t any such thing as 
fate’s list,” he retorted, not laughing 
any more. “If I decide you’re to die, 
you’re dead.” 

He no longer wanted to talk. He 
turned and walked to the edge of the 
stasis, not looking back. As I watch- 
ed, he passed through the edge. The 
invisible wall flared, but seemed to 
offer him no resistance. I was per- 
fectly prepared to believe, however, 
without experiment, that for me the 
stasis was a prison. Either there was 
some kind of wall which I couldn’t 
get through (which seemed likely, 
since the air wasn’t being sucked 
out by the oxygen-greedy flames), or 
I’d die, frizzled to a cinder, before 
I’d completed a single step outside. 



142 



IF 




1 didn’t immediately walk round to 
the other side of the machine. I 
was still coming to myself. Vivid 
as my recollection of the mountain 
of skeletons was, I* wondered if it 
was part of a dream. I hoped it was. 

The last thing to come right was 
my hearing. Stupidly I’d been won- 
dering why, if there were two other 
people here, I couldn’t hear them 
and they hadn’t heard Greg and me 
talking. Were they bound and 
gagged? If so, why, when I wasn’t? 

Then I realized that though in the 
stasis there was no blistering heat 
and no smoke, all the sounds of the 
fire came through, the crackling, 
hissing, boiling, crashing, popping, 
fizzing, sizzling, roaring .... 

Anyway, I knew who the other 
two were. They were Jota and Dina. 

Yet although I knew, I hesitated 
a moment longer. Several times ear- 
lier I’d had a rather theoretical 
thought that if Dina perished, my 
own life might be simpler and better. 
But that’s the kind of thing you 
think only when you don’t believe 
it can happen. When you know it 
can happen, when you know it’s 
more than likely, you discover what 
you really want. 

Dina had to be there. I was hesi- 
tating because I was afraid I was 
wrong, afraid the other two might be 
Gil and Barbara, or Barbara and 
Garry, or Jota and Gil, or some other 
two from the four. 

I might have waited much longer. 
But as my hearing returned to nor- 
mal, I heard Jota’s voice over the 
medley of fire sounds. I moved clos- 
er, started to go round the stasis ma- 
chine, and paused incredulously. 

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



“Wake up, damn you,” Jota was 
saying. “Wake up, little cousin. What 
use are you lying there, while we’re 
stuck in the middle of all this? Wake 
up, you little darling, and become 
useful.” 

He didn’t say exactly this. He 
used all the available oaths, particu- 
larly the sexual ones. 

I moved further round so that I 
could see what was going on. Dina 
was lying on her back, sound asleep, 
and Jota was kneeling beside her, his 
back to me. 

He shook her, gently at first and 
then more insistently. He was saying: 
“There’s nothing wrong with you, 
apart from the thing nobody is sup- 
posed to speak about. Wake up, 
then. Wake up and — ” 

His words then became shockingly 
obscene. The kind of mindless idiot 
from whom deliberate coarseness us- 
ually comes, who expresses the most 
earthy ideas in his earthy experience 
in the most earthy way, doesn’t have 
the intelligence or imagination to 
make much of a job of it. Indeed, 
the more earthy he becomes, the 
less he would shock anybody except 
elderly spinsters, who never hear 
such effusions anyway. 

But Jota was a master of obsceni- 
ty. 

I might have quite admired his 
performance in uncommitted wonder 
if I’d happened to be uncommitted. 
But the girl was Dina. The fact that 
Jota was her cousin didn’t particu- 
larly bother me — if the law allows 
cousins to marry, consanguinity 
ceases to be an issue in all such 
matters. 

What did bother me was that Jota 

143 




Cared for absolutely nothing beyond 
the fact that he was here, and Dina 
was here, and she wouldn’t waken. 
He even made it plain that he didn’t 
care much whether she awakened or 
not. 

That Dina was a child mentally 
was nothing to him. That there was 
something unnatural about her sleep 
was also nothing. 

Jota was single-minded. 

XXIV 

W hy I waited, listening, watch- 
ing, doing nothing, would 
have been hard to explain at the 
time, but not difficult to explain 
afterwards. 

I hadn’t forgotten the case of Jota 
and Sheila. 

I had admired Jota, I had envied 
him, and always I’d been a little 
afraid of him. What it was about him 
that I feared I didn’t know then, 
though I could have guessed that the 
knowledge that nobody had ever 
stood up to Jota and bested him had 
a lot to do with it. 

If at the first moment when I 
knew that Jota was trying to seduce 
my feeble-minded sister I had gone 
round and shown myself, the inci- 
dent might have fizzled out com- 
pletely. Jota would have laughed, I 
would have cooperated with him in 
laughing the whole thing off, and 
that would have been that. 

Why I waited was partly to give 
him enough rope to hang himself, 
mainly to let myself get so angry that 
Jota wouldn’t be able to make me 
laugh the whole thing off as we’d 
done in Sheila’s case. 



Well, that’s what it amounted to. 
I had thrashed Jota, but after that, 
instead of just contemptuously kick- 
ing him out, I had made him pro- 
mise to be a good boy . and if 
Sheila had been willing, we’d all 
have pretended to be friends again. 

I remembered Dina coming down 
the stairs that afternoon and won- 
dered if it was at that moment that 
Jota decided the conquest of his fair 
cousin must be delayed no longer. 

I got more and moce angry. 

I moved only when Jota lost his 
temper, started slapping Dina’s face 
and punched her in the ribs. 

“Jota,” I said, “if you touch her 
again, I’ll kill you.” 

He turned his head. And when I 
saw his face, I knew he was an ani- 
mal. 

Lust makes some of us cheat. 
But it turns only some of us into 
animals like Jota. I knew by his face 
at that moment that when he reach- 
ed this state — as he must have done 
many times — he had ceased to be 
anything resembling a human being. 

If he had to kill, that was all 
right. 

If the woman died, now or later, 
that was unimportant. 

If she was married, if her life and 
those of others were going to be al- 
tered irrevocably in the next few 
seconds — well, what had that to 
do with Jota? 

If she was a feeble-minded kid, 
his cousin, sleeping peacefully 
through disaster — what right had 
she to sleep when he wanted her? 

“Val,” was all he said, but his 
thoughts and emotions showed in 
his face. At first he had no inten- 



144 



IF 




tion of being diverted. Then anger 
followed when he realized the dif- 
ference my presence was bound to 
make. Then . fear? 

The fist I planted in his face, 
rather inexpertly but with consider- 
able force, made up his mind for 
him. This was neither a love scene 
nor a conversation piece. It was a 
fight. He had no choice. 

He made a further effort neverthe- 
less. He jumped to his feet and 
backed away, saying: “Val, let’s be 
reasonable about this — ” 

I leaped on him and hit him on 
the mouth, which spurted blood. Jota 
ceased attempting to be reasonable 
and swung at me. I caught his arm 
and threw him, without any trouble 
at all. 

T here had been a wrestling bill at 
Shuteley one night when I was 
about fifteen, and someone gave me 
a ticket, I’d been fascinated, not by 
wrestling as an entertainment, but 
by the revelation that if you knew 
how you could throw people far 
heavier than yourself all over the 
place. So I found out about it. 

I certainly never became an ex- 
pert wrestler. As far as Jota was 
concerned, however, I might as well 
have been a world champion. I could 
throw him with very little , effort, 
and he had no idea how to fall. In- 
stead of rolling with the throw, he 
came down untidily with a crash 
each time, even on the fairly soft 
ground. 

I threw him every time he got 
up and never followed him down, 
because this wasn’t a sporting con- 
test that would be settled by a body 



press or a submission. I didn’t want 
to hunt him, exactly. Instinctively I 
was trying to beat him, to humble 
him, to teach him a lesson, so that 
he would never make a pass at Dina 
or Sheila again. 

He kept backing, though he didn’t 
actually run away, and to his credit 
he got up every time when he, could. 
And he kept trying to talk to me. 
“Val, you and I shouldn’t be . 
I wasn’t going to . Will you listen 
to me.” And then, rather ludicrous- 
ly, considering his position: “I’m 
warning you, Val!” 

We were close to the edge of the 
stasis, and when I threw him again 
I simply didn’t think about it at all. 
What the stasis was I had no idea. 
To me it was simply a wall. Greg 
had walked through it, but Greg 
was in a special suit. 

When I threw Jota and he rolled 
towards the edge, I expected him to 
stop against it as he’d have done at 
any other wall. 

But he didn’t. 

There was a sudden roar, and I 
was sucked toward the barrier my- 
self as air rushed from the stasis 
into the inferno beyond. Despite the 
brightness of the flames, the sudden 
glare as Jota rolled through made 
everything else seem dull. 

He had no time to scream. 

Outside the stasis the flames were 
dying a little, but the temperature 
had not begun to drop. Out there, 
things that would burn didn’t catch 
fire, they simply dissolved in the 
heat. 

Five seconds after I threw him 
out of the stasis, Jota was not identi- 
fiable even as a cinder. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



145 




A s Jota died, there was a gasp be- 
hind me, a feminine half- 
checked moan of horror. Horrified 
myself, I didn’t turn at once. I as- 
sumed that Dina had wakened. 

It was only when, out of the corn- 
er of my eye, I saw Dina lying on 
the ground, peacefully, comfortably, 
breathing deeply and regularly, that 
I realized someone else had joined 
us. 

I turned and saw Miranda. 

I had not expected to see her 
again. It had seemed likely that she 
was dead. Even if she had survived 
what Greg had done to her, it was 
not in the cards that she’d be moving 
around any more that night; and 
then, lacking a suit, she couldn’t 
get into the stasis through the blaz- 
ing town. 

But she did have a suit. And al- 
though she reeled a bit and her hair 
was over one eye, she was in better 
shape than could have been expected. 

She got in first. “Didn’t you 
know what would happen when he 
hit the stasis? Or did you try to kill 
him . murder him?” 

I had certainly not tried to kill 
Jota, and I was shocked at the man- 
ner of his death and my responsibili- 
ty for it. Yet Miranda’s obvious hor- 
ror at what she had seen filled me 
with incredulity. It rallied me and 
made me temporarily cease to won- 
der that she was here at all. 

I said in sudden anger, “Whatever 
I did, are you to be the judge? You, 
who knew exactly what was going to 
happen and let it happen? You came 
here to watch a gala performance, 
to extract the last ounce of vicar- 
ious enjoyment out of the Great Fire 



of Shuteley. But was that all. Or did 
you start the fire?” 

My outburst didn’t bother her. In 
fact, she calmed down. “You didn’t 
know,” she said. “Anyway, what’s 
remarkable is that you and Jota 
fought, and he died, and you didn’t 
. Why did you fight?” 

I said nothing, merely glanced 
down at Dina. 

She was still sleeping like a baby. 
She looked so happy she must be 
happy, having wonderful dreams. 

“What about Dina?’’ I said. 

“She’s been . treated. She may 
be different when she wakes up. 
That’ll be in about three hours. I 
can’t promise.” 

“And you left her with Jota,” I 
said. 

Miranda’s eyes widened. “You 
don’t mean he ... So that was it. 
Don’t say anything for a minute. Let 
me think.” 

“You seem remarkably concerned 
about Jota. And remarkably uncon- 
cerned about the ten thousand peo- 
ple you allowed to burn to death.” 

“Not ten thousand. Not a thou- 
sand. We saved many who would 
have died. You know that, don’t you? 
Only we couldn’t leave them here, 
we had to take them with us. We 
couldn’t leave here, alive, anyone 
who should have died. Except Jota. 
Saving him, leaving him here alive, 
was one of the main purposes of the 
operation.” 

“It would have been easier to 
avert the fire.” 

She shook her head impatiently. 
“Could you eradicate the French 
Revolution? Could you negate the 
First World War, even if technically 



146 



IF 




the means were in your grasp? No, 
the Shuteley fire had to happen. All 
we could do was make certain small 
changes. Saving Jota, for one.” 

“He died in the fire? Before you 
intervened?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, looks like fate had it in for 
him. But why should a little thing 
like being burned to a crisp prevent 
Jota from living to the age of nine- 
ty? You can loop him back. It’s 
been done before.” 

4 4TT7e’ll have to try to do some- 
▼ V thing like that,” she said 
thoughtfully. “The question is, how? 
I don’t have any apparatus. Greg 
won’t let me return through the 
copse. I can’t return from here un- 
til near dawn. When I do, it’s pretty 
certain that — ” 

“For God’s sake, Miranda, tell me 
what’s going on,” I exclaimed. 
“From the beginning, you’ve been 
saying too much and not enough. 
Either you should have been a per- 
fectly ordinary party of campers 
who knew nothing about anything, 
or you should have concealed noth- 
ing.” 

“Both Greg and I told you too 
much, Val,” she said quietly. “But 
only you. Nothing that anyone else 
knows matters.” 

“Gil? Jota? Sheila? Dina?” 

“Gil is with us, and you’ll never 
see him again. He’s supposed to have 
died in the fire, with Barbara and 
Garry. They’re all with us — else- 
where. Jota, at the moment, isn’t in 
the picture. Sheila knows nothing 
except at second hand, what you tell 
her. And Dina will know less. Or 



rather, the little bit that will remain 
with her will be so improbable that 
she won’t tell anyone but you.” 

As she spoke I realized that, what- 
ever the reasons. I really was the 
one person still breathing and still in 
Shuteley who knew anything impor- 
tant about Snow White and the gi- 
ants. Nobody but me had paid any 
particular attention to them in The 
Copper Beech. Gil had noticed the 
peculiarity about the coins, but he’d 
kept it to himself, and now it would 
be impossible to prove anything. The 
luxon suits had made people stare, 
but by this time everybody but me 
— and Tommy — must have de- 
cided they’d been seeing things. 

Apart from that, Greg had talked 
only to me. And Miranda had talk- 
ed only to me. If I were suddenly 
transported to Parliament or Scot- 
land Yard or the FLAG head of- 
fice, I couldn’t hope to convince the 
people there that the giants were 
anything but a party of kids iri a 
summer camp. Of course there would 
be oddities to excite curiosity, even 
official curiosity. None of the camp- 
ers would ever be traced — they’d 
disappear, with their camp, into thin 
air. Other witnesses would confirm 
the giants’ abnormal proportions. 
And surely I couldn’t be the only 
person to glimpse a giant in a fire- 
suit? But these would be only enig- 
mas. There would be enough to 
make it appear there must be some- 
thing in my story. Not enough to 
prove any signficant part of it. 

“Yes, I see,” I said. “But why 
me? Because I’m not going to be 
around, is that it?” 

“That’s not the reason,” she said, 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



147 




“though just now I can’t see how 
you and Dina can survive. One of 
you, yes. There’s one suit. Not both, 
any way I can figure.” 

We had time to work out some- 
thing about that. It was still a long 
time to dawn. 

“Why me?” I insisted. 

XXV 

W e had been standing talking, 
Miranda still in her suit, the 
goggles at her neck, the hood over 
her head. Now she started to take it 
off, turning away. 

But almost at once she turned 
back. She had made up her mind. 

“Val,” she said, “remember the 
first time I saw you? I knew you. 
I’d seen photographs of you. And 
I was careless enough to show it. 
After that, I spoke to you. So did 
Greg. We both wanted to meet you, 
to make up our minds about you.” 
“So I’m famous?” I said. “Impor- 
tant?” 

“Not important, Val. Not even 
famous. “You’re the villain of the 
Shuteley fire.” 

The calm, factual statement shook 
me. I must have gone white. “I — 
7 started it?” 

“No, no, not that. History didn’t 
need that to make you the villain. 
The scapegoat, if you like. After this 
there’s going to be a new word in 
the language — mather. Not a cap- 
ital ^Mather. You don’t talk of a 
capital Boycott either. Just mather, 
meaning a catastrophe following the 
most incredible incompetence.” 
“Me?” I said stupidly. 

“Oh, it isn’t fair, of course. I know 



that. But history often isn’t fair. An 
inhuman monster becomes a nation- 
al hero. A clever man who made 
one wrong decision goes down as a 
jackass, a blunderer. A fool who did 
one right thing by mistake is held 
up for all time as the personifica- 
tion of wisdom. You — ” 

“Well, what did I do?” 
“Nothing,” she said gently. “I 
said it isn’t fair. You’ll be blamed 
for what you did do, what you 
didn’t do, and history will accept 
wild accusations as trlith. You’ll 
even be confused with old Amos 
What’s-his-name, who died long be- 
fore you were born, and blamed for 
what he did. He started a fire or 
two, you know. The general impres- 
sion of Val Mathers is going to be 
that he was completely heartless and 
unscrupulous and stupid as well. He 
bribed and lied his way to control 
of all insurance in Shuteley and then 
he set fire to the town.” 

“But this is absolutely impossi- 
ble!” I exclaimed. “History can’t — ” 
“Well, there I misled you. Real 
history, the history of the historians, 
will get things much straighten Real 
history is fairer to Captain Bligh, 
too, than the legend. The historians 
know you’re not old Amos and didn’t 
start the fire and lots of other facts 
like that. It’s a fact, too, that it 
would hardly be to your advantage 
to be head of insurance and then 
start the fire. But it’s not facts that 
go into legend.” 

She smiled slightly. “You may, 
now that I’ve warned you, be able 
tQ do something to protect yourself. 
That’s if you do get out.” 

“I most certainly will,” I said 

IF 



148 




warmly. “If what you say is true, 
there must be some villain in the 
piece, and if it’s not me — ” 

“Oh, there you’re wrong again, 
Val. It is you.” 

“I thought you said — ” 

She sighed and said: “We’re in 
the same boat, you and I. You’re 
going to be a scapegoat, and so am 
I. You’re partly to blaine, and I’m 
partly to blame. You for the fire, I 
for the failure of my mission here 
. Wait till I get this suit off, and 
I’ll tell you the whole story.” 

She took off her fire-suit with ob- 
vious relief. It was cool in the stasis, 
but until she took off the suit she 
was insulated from coolness as well 
as heat. There were beads of mois- 
ture on her smooth midriff and her 
bare abdomen glittered with drop- 
lets. 

A large multicolored bruise under 
her right breast showed where Greg 
had hit her — carelessly, mistakenly, 
for there was scarcely any other part 
of her body where such a blow 
would have done less damage. 

I wanted to ask what had happen- 
ed to her and where she got the suit, 
but refrained. I’d hear i:: due course. 

She was going to tell me about 
herself and the giants and Jota and 
the fire. 

She told me. 

T he fire started in the stack room 
of the public library over an 
hour after the library was closed and 
shuttered for the night. This was 
(would be?) established later from 
evidence pieced together too late 
to be of more than academic inter- 
est. Presumably an assistant who 



wasn’t suppposed to be smoking at 
all had thrown down the butt. It 
was going to be assumed that this 
assistant was one Maggie Hobson, an 
elderly library assistant who smoked 
furtively and incessantly. And it was 
a convenient assumption — because 
Maggie Hobson, who lived alone in 
a single room near the library, did 
not survive the fire. 

The stack room, with just enough 
ventilation to act as an efficient fur- 
nace, generated such heat that when 
at last the fire burst its prison, it 
was an explosion of flame. The whole 
library was soon an inferno. 

The fire grew gross in secret by 
one of the many quirks of chance 
that enabled the Shuteley fire to be- 
come what it did. Most public li- 
braries are in the town’s main street; 
they have huge uncurtained windows, 
and a fire inside would be spotted 
as soon as books started to blaze. 

But this library, though in the 
center of town, was just off High 
Street and presented a blank Vic- 
torian-quasi-Greek pillared facade to 
the world. The interior lighting was 
by skylights facing the other way. 

And the warehouse next door, 
with the court behind, was in pro- 
cess of changing hands. It was blank, 
shuttered, empty. There was little in 
the warehouse to help the fire — 
but nothing to hinder it. 

So fingers of flame sped covertly 
through the warehouse to the tim- 
bered houses beyond, through the 
silent court to the rear of the shops 
in High Street, through a church 
hall to a tire store. 

There were automatic fire alarms 
in the library, connected to the fire 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



149 




ination and set to go off at a cer- 
tain temperature. Something went 
wrong; the connection was broken 
without setting off the alarm. Even 
fire alarms are not always wholly 
fireproof. 

Never before had a fire in the 
middle of an inhabited town — and 
not even a sleeping town, for all 
this was around 9:30 — gained such 
a hold unknown to anybody. At oth- 
er times and places something would 
have been seen. But this blaze grew 
behind blank stone and shuttered 
doors. 

Of course it wasn’t long anyway 
before the secret was out. But by 
that time the library, the tire store, 
six shops, four or five houses, the 
inner court, the church hall, the 
warehouse and a filling station an- 
nounced the news simultaneously 
with leaping, roaring flames almost 
beyond hope of control. 

If there had been firemen on the 
spot within five minutes, they 
wouldn’t have had any idea where 
to start. 

But that was another of the laugh- 
able tricks fate played that night. At 
9:35, a matter of minutes before 
Shuteley knew it had a fire of its 
own, the fire units were dashing to 
a farm blaze three miles south of 
the town. Not all of them — not 
for another couple of minutes. Then 
a barn blaze was reported, also 
south of the town, and Shuteley was 
denuded of all official fire-fighting 
potential. 

The irony was that the last tender 
crossed the New Bridge seconds 
after the discovery of the Shuteley 
fire . and it left from the fire 



station across from the library. 

Mere seconds after the first shouts 
of “Fire! Fire!” the blaze had swal- 
lowed the town’s telephone exchange 
and the fire station radio. 

So far there was not a single hu- 
man casualty. And perhaps, if every- 
body had stayed calm and collected, 
there might not have been any. Well, 
perhaps a few people in the near- 
est houses, those which were pretty 
comprehensively on fire before the 
first alarm, must inevitably have 
been trapped. But others, some dis- 
tance and several minutes from the 
heart of the blaze, should have lived, 
and didn’t . 

Wood smoke swept the streets. 
People coughed and ran. A few brave 
souls went the wrong way, trying to 
save wives, children, parents who 
might or might not have already 
escaped. Heat struck them down, for 
this was the hottest of fires. It wasn’t 
a creeping, insidious fire. It was a 
roaring, searing, all-engulfing tiger 
of a fire. A man took three steps 
towards it and never had a chance 
to retrace them. Heat lashed him, 
blinded him, struck him down and 
boiled him. 

Most people had the sense to. go 
the right way. And they lived. Fierce 
as it was, this fire couldn’t race like 
a prairie fire. It had to leap from 
house to house, taking hold — 
taking hold, true, in about a quar- 
ter of the usual time, yet still needing 
time. 

And the people in the streets could 
outrun it with no trouble at all. They 
could even give the alarm as they 
went, that is, if it didn’t take too 
long .... 



150 



IF 




C hildren died because they were 
too slow. Most of the younger 
children were asleep, which put' them 
at a big initial disadvantage. They 
were difficult to rouse; blazing 
towns were outside their experience, 
and they were inclined to waste time 
over such luxuries as screaming for 
parents, putting on clothes, going in 
search of favorite toys. 

Old people died because they 
wouldn’t go without savings, memen- 
tos, insurance policies, pension 
books, framed photographs — and 
often because they wouldn’t leave 
without locking the front door. If 
they’d forgotten the keys, they’d go 
back for them. 

Others died because they couldn’t 
believe it. Fires in towns are put 
out. You watch them as you watch 
workmen excavating. It’s safe across 
the road. Other people are nearer 
than you are. These people couldn’t 
believe that this was something dif- 
ferent, something that was going to 
go down in the history books. They 
had the chance to run for their lives, 
and they didn’t take it. 

They thought other chances would 
come, and they didn’t. 

The fire waited for nobody. 
Given such a splendid start, it spread 
out rapidly in all directions, reach- 
ing the river yery quickly, because 
High Street was only about a hun- 
dred yards from the river. 

Hardly anybody, as it happened, 
fled across any of the bridges. They 
were forced east or west by the 
fire’s dash to the river, over, if they 
had a chance, north. And the fire, 
reaching the river, proceeded to 
spread all the way along it. 



That the firemen weren’t even 
there was an irony, after the first 
few minutes, rather than a significant 
factor. They might certainly have 
helped in giving ithe warning and in 
the withdrawal from the town. They 
could not have done anything that 
mattered in putting the fire out. 

Every man, woman and child who 
looked into the yellow maw of the 
blaze and decided at once to get the 
hell out of this lived to tell ’the tale. 
Those who died were the people 
who for one reason or another 
never had a chance; those who made 
up their minds, erroneously, that 
there was no desperate rush; the 
heroes and heroines; and those who 
thought that there might be an op- 
portunity of making something out 
of the disaster. It was a grim night 
for looters, who gambled on having 
time that they didn’t get. 

In addition, there was Trinity Hall. 

I should have known at once when 
I came on the mound of skeletons 
that this must be the site of Trinity 
Hail. Shuteley had various other 
halls, but only one with two up- 
stairs assembly room where hun- 
dreds of people could gather. 

On the first of the upper floors 
a pensioners’ party was being held. 
Above, a school dance was in full 
swing. 

The stairway, though narrow and 
wooden, was adequate. The trouble 
was by mutual agreement the old 
and the young people had shut them- 
selves off from each other. Neither 
wanted to have anything to do with 
the other. Everyone who was coming 
was present, and both halls were 
firmly barred to gatecrashers. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



151 




The fire raced past the hall on two 
sides and closed in. Nobody escaped 
— the whole thing was too quick. 
The fire escape, ancient as it was, 
was sound enough. But if anyone 
ever got to it (and perhaps nobody 
did), it would have offered a grim, 
hopeless choice — the fire inside, 
the fire outside, the fire all around, 
the fire beyond the fire. 

Because of the noise in both halls 
and those two barred, Keep Out 
doors, in the few vital minutes when 
escape would have been possible, 
nobody knew there was anything to 
escape from. People running before 
the fire in the streets outside were 
shouting, screaming, banging on 
doors — but no bursting in, dash- 
ing upstairs and battering on inside 
doors. 

Brave, foolhardly people else- 



where took heroic chances to spread 
the alarm. But no one happened to 
think of Trinity Hall — no one who 
was in the right place at the right 
time to do anything about it. 

The fire cut the telephones al- 
most at once, but the electricity fail- 
ed in only a few places early on. 
Perhaps it was a blessing that lights 
stayed on; their failure would have 
added to the panic of old and young 
people. 

Yet if the lights had gone out when 
all phones ceased to operate, people 
who got no warning until it was too 
late would have been alerted. At 
the least, television and radio would 
have gone off. 

In Trinity Hall, in particular, the 
sudden failure of all lights would 
have brought both parties to a sud- 
den halt. But the lights stayed on. 




52 



So 61 pensioners and 139 boys 
and girls between thirteen and nine- 
teen died in Trinity Hall. Exactly 
two hundred. And that grisly piece 
of the disaster , more than anything 
else, Miranda told me, was the thing 
which was going to make my name 
stink for ever. 

I didn’t attempt to interrupt as she 
told me what she knew, which 
was less than I’d have expected. 

The giants didn’t really know 
everything. Their remarkable knowl- 
edge which had so impressed me 
on several occasions was merely a 
small collection of isolated bits of 
exact information. Miranda, who 
knew so much about me, hadn’t 
known of the existence of Dina. 
Peiihaps, in the world in which the 
giants played no part, Dina became 



worse, had to go into a home, and 
was not mentioned in any account^ 
that survived. 

Miranda did not, after all, have 
to do much explaining to show me 
how I could become the villain oi 
the Shuteley fire. As she spoke, 1 
could see this for myself. And 1 
felt cold horror at the partial justice 
of it. 

I wasn’t really a villain. I had done 
nothing stupid, immoral’ or illegal. 
And yet ... 

FLAG was to all intents and pur- 
poses the only insurance company 
in Shuteley. Practically all pressure 
exerted on traders, farmers, firms, 
factories and ordinary householders 
to make fire less likely was exerted 
by FLAG — by me. I didn’t per- 
sonally inspect anything, of course. 
But I was responsible. If there was 




SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



153 



blame, it could be 'laid at my door. 

And there was going to be blame. 
After such a catastrophe, millions of 
people all over the world were going 
to feel that such a thing couldn’t 
happen unless someone had* been 
criminally irresponsible. 

There were fire prevention of- 
ficers, too, but not one based in 
Shuteley. Anyway, Shuteley didn’t 
have a bad fire record. Advice on 
fire prevention and official pressure 
for better standards usually follow- 
ed incidents which showed the need 
for them. 

We were the people most respon- 
sible for fire prevention. And we 
were slack. 

FLAG head office was pleased 
with Shuteley. The directors liked 
having a town in their pocket, in- 
surance-wise. As local manager, I 
was expected to carry on the good 
work. Shuteley made more money 
for the firm than any other town 
four times its size, simply because 
of the volume of business. And the 
claims record was highly satisfac- 
tory. The office ran sqioothly. But 
after all, the directors liked Shuteley 
first and foremost because it was 
the one place where the company 
was supreme. Shuteley made them 
feel good. It was unique. 

There was no actual directive, but 
I was well aware that I must not 
lose business, must not allow any 
other insurance company a toehold. 
This meant that I wasn’t supposed 
to be too hard to please. It would 
never do if we wouldn’t insure a 
property and some other company 
would; if we insisted on certain fire 
safeguards and the other company 



waived them; if we set a higher pre- 
mium than the other company. 

S o, while our methods in Shuteley 
were not exactly bent, they had 
always been yielding. No doubt some 
of the town’s smarter business men 
knew our position and cunningly 
took advantage of it. We wanted to 
insure them, and prestige mattered 
even more than profit. We could 
easily be maneuvered into giving a 
better deal than anyone else. We 
could also be persuaded to be satis- 
fied with lower standards of safety 
than anyone else. 

No, I hadn’t been careless. I 
hadn’t been crooked. I had merely 
been more easily satisfied than any 
insurance manager anywhere else 
would have been, with full backing 
from my firm. 

But my firm’s backing was going 
to fade away after this, after the stag- 
gering claims that would be made. 
FLAG would have to pay, in ef- 
fect, the cost of the town, plus the 
insured value of the lives lost. Al- 
though the bill wouldn’t kill the firm, 
it would make it very sick indeed. 
And instead of being the blue-eyed 
boy who kept a whole town in the 
company’s pocket, I’d be the crass 
idiot whose incompetent methods 
were partly or even wholly respon- 
sible for the biggest pay-out ever 
made by any single insurance com- 
pany in the world. 

Also the firm’s backing would 
fade away the moment there was 
a hint of public concern about the 
branch’s methods. 

Naturally the firm had known 
what I was doing and approved. 



154 



IF 




But that was before the Great Fire 
of Shuteley. 

Oh, I could see it all. People 
like to have someone to blame. And 
I was just sufficiently involved to be 
a perfect choice. 

“The most unfair bit,” Miranda 
said quietly, “is the way Trinity Hall 
will be blamed on you. A fire of- 
ficer called Christie inspected it a 
year ago and reported.” 

I groaned. I hadn’t exactly forgot- 
ten the incident, I had merely failed 
to fit it in place. I knew what was 
coming. 

“You saw Christie and showed 
him your own inspector’s report on 
Trinity Hall. This said that although 
the building wasn’t up to the highest 
fire-prevention standards and had a 
big proportion of wood in the struc- 
ture, and old wood at that, although 
the situation left a great deal to be 
desired, all fire-safety conditions 
were fully met.” 

“That’s enough,” I said. It was 
more than that: it was too much. 

I wanted to hear about other 
things, no longer that. 

“What happened to you?” I 
asked. 

XXVI 

44/^reg hit 'hard,” she said, “but 

V-J not hard enough. I’m small, 
yet I’m pretty tough. I came to in 
the river, choking, and let it carry 
me almost to the blockage. Then I 
swam ashore. I had a suit hidden in 
some bushes as a safeguard. It wasn’t 
entirely a surprise to me, what Greg 
did.” 

“What I can’t understand,” I be- 



gan and stopped. I was going to 
say I couldn’t understand why Greg 
was allowed to sabotage everything 
that the others were trying to do, 
whatever that was, why Miranda 
and the rest of the giants had ever 
thought for a moment it was worth 
going ahead with their scheme while 
Greg was along with them, wrecking 
every move they made, and in the 
end trying to kill Miranda .and fail- 
ing only because in his vicious anger 
he preferred to lash out rather than 
make quite sure of her. 

But that was only one of the 
things I couldn’t understand. The 
others rose up and silenced me, 
tongue-tying me because I couldn’t 
make up my mind which to press 
first. 

Miranda, not surprisingly, was no 
longer immaculate. The two minute 
pink garments she wore were mere- 
ly utilitarian, totally dissimilar from 
the subtle, carefully designed bikini 
she had worn that afternoon. It was 
probable that she and the giants 
had worn the briefs under their suits 
simply to avoid startling too much 
the Shuteley people who were to 
see them. 

She was scratched and bruised, 
apart from the huge discoloration 
where Greg had hit her. And seeing 
her as she was then reminded me 
of the impossible glossiness of all 
the giants. 

“You do come from the future,” 
I said. 

“What you call the future,” she 
agreed. “What we know as the pres- 
ent.” 

“That’s a play on words.” 

“No. Time doesn’t happen all at 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



155 




once. The moving finger writes, and 
having writ, moves on. The date is 
2197.” 

“ Your date.” 

“No. The date. At this moment, 
it’s April 17, 2197 — a Wednesday, 
if you care to check. What comes 
after April 17, 2197, is the future, 
completely inaccessible. Before 2197 
is the partly accessible past.” 

Her certainty irritated me. “This 
is what makes all you people cruel, 
inhuman — the delusion that your 
own period is the only one that mat- 
ters.” 

She was as certain as the torturers 
of the Inquisition. “It’s April 17, 
2197.” 

“Then I was born to no real exis- 
tence? I live out my life in the shad- 
ows, dead from the moment I was 
born?” 

That made her pause for a mo- 
ment. “The metaphysical problems,” 
she said at last, “are far beyond me. 
Perhaps you lived out your life in 
the second half of the twentieth cen- 
tury . perhaps you’re restored 
to play it out again at the end of 
the twenty-second. I can’t tell you 
the truth from your angle. All I 
know is that the pointer of time 
stands at 2197.” 

When I tried to argue, she went 
on: “Val, just think. I was born in 
2167, and I’m here. Time must have 
reached ...” 

So she was thirty. It was surpris- 
ing, in a way disappointing. She 
could have been eighteen or eighty, 
from what I had known, guessed 
and imagined. Thirty seemed an in- 
determinate age for Miranda. It 
seemed an anticlimax. 



She went on trying to convince 
me that time had always reached a 
definite point, just as a clock had to 
register something, even if it had 
stopped. The date, the vital date, 
the only date that had any life or 
meaning was April 17, 2197. Any- 
thing before that was the past; any- 
thing in front of it was the future. 

Presently she realized she was 
wasting her time trying to convince 
me and abandoned the attempt. 

“It doesn’t matter,” she sighed, 
sitting down and leaning back against 
the stasis machine. “Ydu want to 
know, but you don’t want to know. 
You think you want the truth. All 
you want, of course, is what you 
want to hear.” 

“I do want the truth,” I retorted. 
“What is it? You’re a history class? 
At a college?” 

Her eyes widened. “That’s near 
enough true,” she admitted. “I’m 
the teacher. The rest are pupils. But 
we’re more than just a class. There 
are changes to be made.” 

“Changes? You’re committing 
suicide, then? Change the past — 
your past, if you insist — and you 
change everything.” 

“No,” she said patiently. “Time 
can’t be changed, though bits of it 
can. Think of time as a river. It’s 
an old idea, the river of time. But 
the analogy can be taken a good 
deal farther. Time is a river. And 
it’s April 17, 2197. Remember that, 
assume that, as a hypothesis, even 
if you’re not convinced. Suppose we 
of 2197 interfere in the past, what 
happens?” 

“You cease to exist,” I said. “You 
wink out as if you never were.” 



156 



IF 




“No,” she said. “Remember, the 
past is a river. Block a river, and 
what happens? Except in one case 
in a million, just what happened 
here. The river flows to the sea. 
Block it, and it takes another course. 
It still flows to the sea. Can you 
even imagine anything else? And ex- 
cept in the most unusual circum- 
stances, the contour of the land 
forces the river to return to its origi- 
nal course rather quickly, and flow 
on as if it had never left it. Just 
think — the very fact that a river 
exists means that gravity is forcing 
all the surplus water in the area to 
collect and flow in a certain direc- 
tion. Stop the flow, and the water 
makes a detour and then returns to 
the original direction, the original 
bed.” 

W hat she said made sense, but 
only in a limited way. Arguing 
by analogy proved nothing. She was 
saying, in effect, that because a river 
would act in a certain way, time 
must act in the same way. 

I said so. 

She agreed. “It doesn’t always hap- 
pen. A river flows one side of a 
hill. Divert it even a few yards at a 
certain point, and it must flow the 
other side of the hill. And then it’s 
possible that it never gets back to 
the original' course. Well, that can 
happen in time, too, but even more 
rarely than it does with a river. 
Make minor changes in the past, and 
your own time is certainly affected 
. but not in a catastrophic way. 

The river makes a detour and re- 
turns to its original course.” 

She paused and then said quietly: 



“I ought to know, because I’ve done 
it more than once.” 

“You’ve done it? Changed the 
past?” 

She stood up and began to walk 
about. The flames were dying, I saw, 
for the firelight flickering on her 
skin, making it yellow and orange 
and red but mainly a deep bronze, 
was far less bright than it had been 
when Jota and I fought. 

“About twenty-five years ago it 
was discovered that it was possible 
to alter the past, for a purpose, with- 
out making a vast, indiscriminate 
chaos of time. At this moment, all 
the force and life of time is in Wed- 
nesday, April 17, 2197. Any time 
diversion made anywhere has its ef- 
fect, perhaps a vast effect on 2197, 
but in the changed world I still 
exist, I’m still a teacher, I still do 
the same things at the same time.” 

The paradoxes of time travel have 
always fascinated some people, but 
I’d never been one of them. I had 
assumed, as most people did, that 
if you somehow managed to change 
even the tiniest event in the past, 
the consequnces which must result 
would multiply, square and cube 
themselves with every passing milli- 
second, producing even in a few 
years a totally different world. 

If a girl were delayed ten seconds 
and consequently never met the man 
she would have married, never had 
the children, grandchildren, great- 
grandchildren she would have had, 
naturally the future must be quite 
different. Yet far tinier changes 
must, I had believed and still be- 
lieved, be just as significant. 

“What sort of changes have you 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



157 




made?” I demanded. “And how do 
you know you’ve made them?” 

She smiled and sat down again. 
But she was very restless. Some- 
thing was bothering her, something 
that to her was far more important 
than the Great Fire of Shuteley — 
which, after all, was only history. 

“Anyone who moves in time,” she 
said, “remembers everything. You 
were in a loop, so you know what 
happens. You experience and remem- 
ber the entire loop — the previous 
track, what happened, the return, 
the change in events, the conse- 
quence.” 

Jota and I had entered the camp, 
fought; Jota had been killed, and I 
had killed. Then we’d been pushed 
back a few minutes and lived through 
a different version of the incident. 
And we remembered everything. 

Miranda went on: “What have we 
changed? Sorry, Val, I can’t tell you. 
It’s better not. They’re all in your 
future. This is the farthest-back point 
where a change has been sanction- 
ed.” 

“So it’s sanctioned, is it?” I de- 
manded. “Your parliament or senate 
or whatever you’ve got calmly de- 
cides to monkey with — ” 

“Wait, please.” She laid her hand 
on my arm. “Cool down. You know 
nearly enough now for me to tell you 
plainly and simply why we’re here, 
what we intended to do, and how 
the operation .is going.” 

S he was, however, in no hurry to 
start. And now that it had come 
to the point, I felt no urge to hurry 
her. 

We all like a safe, ordered world. 



Me more than most. The idea of 
people watching you, interfering with 
you, manipulating you makes the 
flesh creep. And yet, in this very 
special case, if the giants had come 
to do the obvious thing and did it, 
if even now they could be persu- 
aded to do it, I for one would have 
been delighted they came. Though 
afterwards, I wouldn’t want any 
such interference again. 

“We’re here to have two people,” 
she said. “One is Garry Carswell . 
not that he died in the original fire. 
If he had, we wouldn’t have known 
his importance — he wouldn’t have 
had any importance. What did hap- 
pen was that he lived, horribly 
scarred and mutilated, with the mind 
of a genius, but a traumatic genius 
who never really escaped the Fire of 
Shuteley. We believe that by saving 
him, which we’ve done — letting 
him die might have been another 
way — we can avert . .” 

She stopped. “No, I won’t tell you 
about our time, your future,” she 
said. “Nobody should ever want to 
know that, for certain.” It’s enough 
to say that our world may be a 
better place if Garry Carswell never 
grows up to be a brilliant diabolist. 
We’ve also saved his parents, Gil 
and Barbara, to live in our world. 
They died in the original fire, and 
that fact didn’t help Garry. You 
won’t see any of them again.” 

This didn’t bother me: most peo- 
ple who had the choice of living in 
2197 or dying in 1966 would find 
the choice easy. Many would even 
be glad to make the change. 

“And the other you came to save 
was Jota,” I said. “Well, that

IF 




shouldn’t cause you any trouble. 
Make one of your loops, as you call 
them, and give him a third life, or 
a fourth or fifth, or whatever it is. 

“That might be possible, but for 
Greg.” 

“Yes, it all comes back to Greg, 
doesn’t it?” 

She shivered, probably partly at 
the thought of Greg and what he had 
done and what he still might do, 
and partly because it was rather cool 
and airy in the stasis, in comparison 
with the various kinds and degrees 
of heat we had all been experiencing. 
Jumping up, she pulled at her two- 
piece and with no trouble at all the 
scraps of material became a leotard, 
knitting at her waist with no ap- 
parent join. It was only a trivial 
miracle, hardly worth mentioning. 

‘The loops,” she said, “are legal. 
They’re allowed. Only minimal ap- 
paratus is required, and the effect 
is extremely local. A few people are 
affected; the rest of the world is 
quite unaffected.” 

“Legal?” I said. “Allowed?” 

“The moment time-molding be- 
came possible, there was immediate, 
irresistible public pressure for loops.” 

Sitting down again, she snuggled 
close to me, quite impersonally, 
merely for warmth. I had been noth- 
ing; then a lover; now I was a friend, 
if that. 

“Think how the very possibility 
of loops instantly transfigures the 
world. Most accidents can be averted 
up to five seconds before they hap- 
pen. A precious vase is dropped 
. turn back the clock, undrop 
the vase, and it lasts another thou- 



sand years. More important ... a 
driver is careless for a fraction of a 
second, and a car plunges into a 
river. Regain the last five seconds; 
drowned people are undrowned.” 

“As Jota and Wesley were unkill- 
ed,” I murmured. 

“Exactly. The permitted technique 
works only over a short period, a 
few minutes at most, and a tiny area. 
But it’s saved thousands of lives, a 
lot of valuable property and pre- 
vented many disasters. Now, you 
want to know about Greg.” 

“Yes, Greg,” I said. “Tell me 
about Greg. Explain the inexplica- 
ble.” 

“Why he’s here? Well, he’s got the 
Gift” 

“The gift?” 

“He’s a witch doctor. Only his 
magic works.” 

T he introduction of further go 
bledegook irritated me. I v 
just beginning to figure out how t 
business made sense. And then s 
introduced something fantastic whi. 
could never make sense. 

Before I could speak, she sa 
sharply: “Don’t say it. Val, yo 
haven’t been very bright. You couL 
tell me far more about the Gift than 
I can tell you. You know all about 
it. Or you would, if you’d ever 
opened your eyes.” 

I could think of only one explan- 
ation. “/’ve got it?” I exclaimed. 
“No, not you. Jota.” 

Step by step she made me re- 
member, and interpret. And I lived 
through years of my life with her, 
prompted by her.

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

I have just been reading some of 
my back issues of If and I am now 
completely sold on Retief. The first 
one I read was Retief — God Speak- 
er, and I thought it was fantastic. 

I have also enjoyed the Berserker 
and Gree stories as much. In the 
October, 1965 issue you included a 
bibliography of Retief. I was wond- 
ering whether or not you could do the 
same thing for the Gree and Ber- 
serker stories. — F. McLeilan, 2436 
Park Row West, Montreal 28, P. Q.

Dear Editor: 

You said in If: “ Every (series) 
story has to stand on its own merits, 
so that if you’ve never read any- 
thing that went before it in the 
series you’ll still be able to under- 
stand it and enjoy it. So we’ve never 
felt it necessary to say anything 
about the series status of a story 
in the introduction.” 

Now there’s nothing worse than 
reading a story studded with refer- 
ences to preceding stories in the 
series — like a private joke. But 
the writer can’t be expected to ex- 
plain everything that has happened 
in earlier stories. Cordwainer Smith 



cannot, in each Casher O’Neill story, 
devote a page to explaining why 
Casher was exiled from his own 
planet. (I remember in the old Har- 
dy Boy books how the author would 
painstakingly rehash all the facts 
about Frank and Joe in all 40-odd 
books, for the benefit of new read- 
ers.) Far better that the reader visit 
a second-hand book store and read 
the preceding stories. 

Besides which, when I read a good 
series story I immediately want to 
read all the other stories in the same 
series. Since the Galaxy magazines 
aren’t indexed, the search can be 
long and unrewarding. It would 
greatly help if you listed the other 
stories in the series, too. — Jeffrey 
P. Rensch, 2433 Via Sonoma, Palos 
Verdes Estates, California 90275. 

O You sure those lengthy rehashes 
were “were for the benefit of new 
readers?” Our guess would be they 
were for the benefit of old writers, 
looking for an easy way to fill up 
blank pages ! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

When Murray Leinster writes for 
If he certainly knows which side his 
bread is “but” tered on. His story A 



160 




Planet Like Heaven , is thirteen 
pages long. On nine of those thirteen 
pages three or more sentences start 
with the word “but”. It’s enough to 
make a man “butt” his head against 
a wall! — Walter Erbach, 2979 
Dudley, Lincoln, Nebraska.

Dear Editor: 

As you and some of your read- 
ers know, there is an international 
organization, sometimes described 
as a “lonely heads club,” called 
Mensa. 

The only requirement for mem- 
bership is a documented intelli- 
gence level above that of 98% of the 
population. The opportunity of com- 
municating with others at this level, 
is, I think, the principal reason for 
joining, since many of us are es- 
sentially outside the mainstream of 
human activity, having been var- 
iously described as “misfits” and 
“social cripples.” 

Mensa has no political or reli- 
gious orientation. It is not orthodox 
in the doctrinaire sense of the word. 
Its primary purpose is to research 
into intelligence via a ready-made 
group of high-IQ persons who are 
willing to assist in this sort of re- 
search by answering questionnaires 
and the like. There is also the op- 
portunity for social contact with 
fellow intellects at the local level, 
since many areas have local Mensa 
groups. 

At the present time, we are 
trying to form a special interest 
group, within Mensa, for science 
fiction. Anyone who is already a 
member of Mensa and is interested 
in this idea should contact Alma 
Hill, 463 Park Drive, Boston, Mass., 
02215, and mention this letter. Any- 
one who is not a member of Mensa 
and wants information about join- 



ing will receive it if he/she writes 
to me. 

For, lo, these many years, we 
have all talked about the mind- 
stretching qualities of science fic- 
tion and its appeal to a high-in- 
telligence segment of the reading 
public. Now is a good time to prove 
it to ourselves.

Dear Editor: 

Although I have been reading 
If, Galaxy and Worlds of Tomorrow 
since 1960 I have yet to see a SF 
fan club in the Pittsburgh area. I

ence there since the 18th World 
Science Fiction Convention, but I 
have been unable to find any. I 
don’t even know ONE person who

reads science fiction is an idiot. 
So please help me. I’m desperate.

Dear Editor: 

Brother Drake Maynard in Hue

nominated Build We Must by Dan-

of the year. I’m afraid I must pro- 
test. I am fighting rather dirty 
here, but I protest anyway. In the 
July issue along with Brother May- 
nard’s letter was another short-short 
by the same author called The Man 
from When. Though I did like the 
first story, the second one is defi- 
nitely better and hits you harder.

ever happened to that second Asimov 
story you mentioned way back last 
year in If, the one was in Galaxy 
but whatever happened to no. 2?

Dear Editor: 

Shame on you. An editor should 
be a bat more careful when read- 
ing stories employing a sex-switch 
trick. 

I refer to the story Arena , by 
Mack Reynolds, published in the 
September, 1966 issue (#106). The 
key to this tale lies in the fact that 
Billy is Ken’s wife, and therefore 
female, not male, as the reader is 
likely to assume at the beginning of 
the story. The reader is particularly 
helped along in this assumption by 
text which appears in the first para- 
graph of the second column of page 
78. If I may quote: 

“ . There in the sand was 
Billy, his body bearing a score of 
gaily ribboned darts.” (Italics mine).

yourself? Do I rate a free sub-

Dear Editor: 

* I have been reading science fic- 
tion for something like forty years, 
and in the desert of 90% unmiti- 
gated crud of Sturgeon’s Law, your 
magazine has been a welcome oasis. 

However, with the July issue I 



am very much afraid that my in- 
terest in your magazine has come 
to a regrettable end; this occasioned 
by the gratuitous (and badly writ- 
ten) attack upon the John Birch 
Society in the story, Bircher. 

It is the usual editorial plea, in 
such cases, that a good yarn is not 
to be bowdlerized merely because it 
might be expected to offend a min- 
ority of the readers; this argument 
might carry a great, deal more 
weight if I were not so very sure 
that if you were to receive a manu- 
script setting forth, the society for 
what it is — an association of some 
of the finest people in the United 
States — you’d reject it out of 
hand, no matter how well written.

Dear Editor : 

This is the first time I have 
written your magazine, but I just 
have to express my thanks to you. 
I think A. A. Walde’s Bircher s, is 
truly a fresh and enjoyable story. 
Mr. Walde seems to have great 
promise as a SF writer. His style 
is quite similar to the style used 
for writing some of the detective 
stories of the 1950’s. I would like 
to see more of Mr. Walde’s work. 

Finally, I would like to say that 
I found Mr. Berry’s letter proposing 
a new look for SF magazines very 
good. Mr. Pohl, what is the chance 
of such a magazine being published?

fair. But we do think about it from

the Foundation Trilogy 



T) Y 12,067 it was clear that the massively cor- 
rupt Galactic Empire was near total col- 
lapse. Its myriad worlds had already begun to 
war among themselves, plunging the universe 
into barbaric chaos. Civilization seemed doomed. 

But master scientists laboring to ensure that 
civilization would be preserved during the dark 
ages to come, established twin “Foundations” at 
opposite ends of the Galaxy, to form the nucleus 
of a new civilization, and in time to unite across 
the Galaxy to form a new ... a stronger ... a 
more enduring Second Empire. 

In Foundation and Foundation and Empire , 
we follow the course of the First Foundation as 
it rekindles the light of civilization in an ever- 
increasing portion of the Galaxy — and as it is 
confronted by its greatest crisis: a dangerous 
mutant, an evil yet brilliayit psychopath whose 
soul-consuming desire is conquest of the Galaxy! 

Within a decade, he tyrannized the entire 
Galaxy — except for the Second Foundation. 
And this became his mania — to find and conquer 
the Second Foundation. Everything in the 
Galaxy must be his! . .
