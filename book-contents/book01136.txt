Unnatural Selection 



A LL OF the Darwinian Theory 
is based on the doctrine of the 
survival of the fittest — fittest 
meaning, in this sense, the individ- 
ual most likely to have offspring 
which in turn will survive long 
enough to have more offspring. 
Some organisms produce this 
fitness simply by laying so many 
tens of thousands of eggs that 
a lot of them hatch and survive. 
Others by developing organs or 
traits which make them fast, in- 
telligent or dangerous to foes. As 
a theory, this one is elegant and 
highly productive — insofar as it 
relates to the past. 

As to the future, however, 
there’s not much hope for it. 

There are three main reasons 
for thinking so. First of all, what 
used to be antisurvival traits no 
longer get weeded out — and, in- 
deed, sometimes are selected for. 
(Witness the milk cow, which 
couldn’t live a week in an en- 
vironment containing large pred- 
ators; witness the genes for 
various human weaknesses like 
nearsightedness and agam- 
maglobulinemia, which used to be 
selected out and now are com- 
pensated for admirably by glasses 
or by drugs.) Secondly, some 
traits that used to be prosurvival 
(and still are, for the individual) 
are now distinctly deleterious to 
the species in general — witness the 



prevailing population explosion. 

But the most interesting indica- 
tion of a non-Darwinian future 
lies in the technological develop- 
ment of new organs for man. 

Consider ESP. There’s very lit- 
tle evidence that it exists between 
human beings, though many of 
us think it ought to and most 
of us wish it did. But there’s good 
evidence now that it exists — or 
can be made to exist — between 
men and machines. It works like 
this. Put an EEC skullcap on your 
head, tracing the electrical cur- 
rents in your brain and reading 
them out as waveforms on a 
cathode tube. Program a computer 
to scan those patterns and inter- 
pret them as commands: If they 
grow in amplitude or frequency 
they make the machine go faster. 
If they dwindle they make the 
machine go slower or turn it off. 
Practice consciously changing the 
shape of the waves as you see 
them on the tube — and with a 
little luck and a lot of pract'". 
you can run the machine without 
normal sensory communication. 

Is it really ESP? 

Not in the traditional sense, to 
be sure. But still it is extra- 
sensory, all right — and of course 
the machine does perceive. 

The trouble with Darwinism is 
that it’s too slow. It takes a 
million years or so to make a 
new species. Chances are tech- 
nology can do it in a matter of 
decades. — FREDERIK POHL

The Dark Continents 
of 

Your Mind 



DO YOU struggle for balance? Are you forever trying to 
maintain energy, enthusiasm and the will to do? Do your personality 
and power of accomplishment ebb and flow — like a stream con- 
trolled by some unseen valve? Deep within you are minute organ- 
isms. From their function spring your emotions. They govern your 
creative ideas and moods — yes, even your enjoyment of life. Once they 
were thought to be the mysterious seat of the soul — and to be left 
unexplored. Now cast aside superstition and learn to direct intel- 
ligently these powers of self. 




Let the Rosicrucians, an age-old fra- 
ternity of thinking men and women (not 
a religion), point out how you may fash- 
ion life as you want it — by making the 
fullest use of these little-understood nat- 
ural faculties which you possess. This is 
a challenge to make the most of your 
heritage as a human. Write for the Free

HUMANS , 




A. E. VAN VOGT 




I 

ajT ACH morning,” Miliss said, 
Li “is the dawn of nothing.” 

So she was leaving. 

“No children, no future,” the 
woman continued. “Every day like 
every other, going nowhere. The 
sun shines but I’m in darkness — ” 
It was, Dav realized, the begin- 



ning of the death talk. He tensed 
his perfect muscles. His blue 
eyes — they could observe with 
a deep understanding on many 
levels — misted with sudden anx- 
iety. But his lips and his infinitely 
adaptable tongue — which in its 
time, and that time was long in- 
deed, had spoken a hundred 
languages — said no word. 



4 



His mission was io make a gift of 
humanity's past to beings of an 
alien planet — and discover: Could 
Man survive his own immortality? 




He watched her, made no move 
to help her and no effort to stop 
her as she piled her clothes onto 
a powered dolly, to be wheeled 
into the east wing of the house. 
Her clothes, her jewels from a 
score of planets; her special 
pillows and other bedroom arti- 
cles; the specific furniture — each 
piece a jewel in itself — in which 



she stored her possessions; her 
keys — plain and electronic, push- 
button control types for energy 
relays and tiny combination 
systems for entry into the great 
Reservoir of the Symbols — all 
now were made ready to be 
transported with a visibly growing 
impatience. 

Finally she snapped, “Where is 



5 



your courtesy? Where is your 
manliness — letting a woman do all 
this work?” 

Dav said evenly, “It would be 
foolish of me to help you leave 
me.” 

“So all those years of polite- 
ness — I merely bought them 
with unalienated behavior. You 
have no natural respect for a 
woman — or for me.” 

She yelled accusations at him. 
Dav felt a tremor stir inside him, 
not from her words but from the 
meaning of the anger that ac- 
companied them, the unthinking 
automatic quality of that anger. 

He said flatly, “I am not going 
to help you leave me.” 

It was the kind of answer one 
made to a stereotype. His hope 
had to be that these preliminaries 
of the death compulsion could be 
headed off. 

His words, however, were far 
from effective. Her blond cheeks 
gradually turned to a darker color 
as the day — unlike other days, 
which were often as slow as 
forever — devoured itself, digesting 
hours in great gulps. And still 
her possessions, more numerous 
evidently than she had realized, 
were not shifted from the west 
to the east wing of the long, big 
house. 

Late in the afternoon Dav 
pointed out that her act of with- 
drawal was a well-known phe- 
nomenon of internal female 
chemistry. He merely wanted from 
her the analytical consciousness 
of this fact — and her permission 
to give her the drugs that would 
rectify the condition. 



She rejected the argument. 
From her lips poured a stream 
of angry rationalizations. 

“The woman is always to 
blame. The fault is in her, not 
in the man. The things that I 
have had to put up with — they 
don't count — ” 

Long ago, when she was still 
in her natural state, before the 
administration of the first im- 
mortality injections, there might 
have been genuine cause for ac- 
cusations which attacked male 
subjectiveness. But that was back 
in a distant time. After the body 
had been given chemical aids all 
things were balanced by a diet 
of understanding drugs. 

D AV located the relevant book 
in the library and abandoned 
his initial attempts to keep from 
her the seriousness of her condi- 
tion. He walked beside her and 
read paragraphs detailing the 
emotional affliction that had led 
to the virtual destruction of the 
human race. The dark thoughts 
she had expressed — and was now 
acting on — were described so ex- 
actly that abruptly, as he walked 
beside her, he bent in her direc- 
tion and held the book up to 
her face. His finger pointed out 
the significant sentences. 

Miliss stopped. Her eyes, a 
deceptive gray-green, narrowed. 
Her lips tightly compressed, un- 
mistakably resisting what he was 
doing. Yet she spoke in a mild 
tone. 

“Let me see that.” 

She reached for the book. 

Dav surrendered it reluctantly. 



6 



GALAXY 



The sly purpose he detected in 
her seemed even more automatic 
than the earlier anger. In those 
few hours she appeared to have 
become a simpler, more primitive 
person. 

So he was not surprised when 
she raised the book above her 
head and, with a wordless 
vocalization, flung it to the floor 
behind him. 

They had come to within a few 
yards of a door which led to her 
part of the house. Dav resignedly 
stooped to pick up the book, 
aware of her walking rapidly to 
that door. It opened and slammed 
shut behind her. 

After silence descended, after 
the coming of the brilliant, purple 
Jana twilight, when the sun finally 
sank out of sight behind the 
slickrock mountains to the west 
and the sweet, soft darkness of 
the shining, starlit night of Jana 
settled, Dav tested the connecting 
doors between the two wings. All 
four resisted his pull with the 
rigidity of unbreakable locks. 

HE following morning. 

The sound of a buzzer pre- 
cipitated Dav into the new day. 
For a meager moment the hope 
stirred in him that Miliss was 
calling. But he rejected that 
possibility even as he formed the 
image in his mind that triggered 
the nearest thought amplifier. His 
dismissal of the idea turned out 
to be correct. The buzzing ceased. 
A picture formed on the ceiling 
screen. It showed a Jana trades- 
boy with groceries standing at the 
outer door. 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



Dav spoke to the boy in the 
Jana tongue and glided out of 
bed. Presently he was accepting 
the bag from the long-nosed 
youth, who said, “There was a 
message to bring this to another 
part of the house. But I didn't 
understand clearly — ’’ 

Dav hesitated with the fleeting 
realization that the ever-present 
Jana spy system was probably 
behind those words. And that if 
he explained, the informatic 1 
would be instantly relayed to the 
authorities. Not that he could ever 
tell these beings the truth. Their 
time for immortality was not yet. 

Nor was it their time to learn 
the numerous details of the final 
disaster — when, in a period of a 
few months, virtually the entire 
human population of the galaxy 
rejected life, refused the pro- 
longation drugs. People by the 
billion hid themselves and died 
unattended and uncaring. 

A few, of course, were captured 
by appalled survivors and had 
treatment forced on them. A 
wrong solution, it developed. For 
the people who sympathized and 
helped, by those very desperate 
feelings, in some manner attuned 
themselves into the same deadly 
psychic state as the naturally 
doomed. 

In the end it was established 
that the only real survivors were 
individuals who felt a scathing 
contempt for people who could 
not be persuaded to accept help. 
Such a disdainful survivor could 
sarcastically argue with some- 
one — yes, for a while. But 
force him, no. 



7 



Dav stood at the door of the 
great house in which he and Miliss 
had lived these several hundred 
years. And he realized that this 
was the moment. 

To save himself he had to re- 
member that what Miliss was 
doing deserved his total disgust. 

He shrugged, and said, “My 
wife has left me. She is living 
alone on the other side of the 
house. So deliver these to the door 
at the far east side.” 

He thrust the bag of groceries 
back into the hands of the Jana 
and motioned him away. 

The boy took the big sack and 
backed off with visible reluctance. 

“Your wife has left you?” he 
echoed finally. 

Dav nodded. In spite of himself 
he felt vaguely regretful at the 
revelation. To these Jana males, 
pursuit of females began early and 
continued into late life, terminat- 
ing approximately at the moment 
of death. Until now the human 
woman had been a forbidden and 
unapproachable female. But no 
question — there had always been 
a perverted Jana male interest in 
Miliss. 

With an abrupt dismissal Dav 
suppressed such thoughts. What 
they represented was unimportant. 
It did not matter. 

L ATER that day he saw her in 
her part of the garden, lissome, 
still beautiful, showing no signs 
of immediate deterioration. Ap- 
parently — even on this second 
day — she was still an immortal 
blond woman. Seeing her, Dav 
shrugged and turned away, his lip 

8 



curling and in his mind the 
thought that she was not really 
human. 

She could not reason. 

Still later darkness had fallen 
when, after testing with the 
various keys the Blaze Points of 
the Great Reservoir of the Sym- 
bols, he came to the summit of 
the hill from which he could see 
their long, white house. 

Its night lights showed the gar- 
den and the glint of the river 
on the far side. But around it 
nothing moved. Silent stood the 
old house, familiar, a centuries- 
old landmark. 

Something about the stillness 
below disturbed him. He had a 
sudden feeling that no one was 
there. The house itself was 
dark — both wings. 

Puzzled but not alarmed — be- 
cause he was safe and Miliss did 
not count for she was doomed 
anyway — Dav hurried down. He 
tried first a door to her wing. 
It was unlocked. 

An amplified thought hit him. 
Miliss speaking mentally. 

Dav, l have been arrested by 
Jaer Dorrish and am being taken 
to a military prison. / have the 
impression that this is a Dorrish 
clan takeover scheme and that it 
is connected with the fact that 
Rocquel has now been gone for 
a year. That’s all. 

The account was succinct, as 
impersonal as his own receipt of 
it. She had left him a communica- 
tion of facts. In her message was 
no appeal, no request for help. 

Dav stood silent. He was evok- 
ing a mental picture of the sar- 

GALAXY 




HUMANS, GO HOME!

donic Jaer Dorrish and, more 
vaguely, the image of Rocquel, the 
hereditary leader of the Janae, 
who had disappeared slightly 
more than one Jana year ago. 
A year on Jana was three hundred 
ninety-two and a fraction days 
long. 

He felt opposed to Jaer, of 
course — in a way wished the 
steely-minded Rocquel were back. 
Usurpations usually meant trouble 
and unrest. But if it had to be, 
it had to. The Janae constituted 
a problem for him as Guardian 
of the Symbols. But individuals 
among them were not, in one 
sense, important. Though he had 
liked Rocquel, and still liked 
Rocquel’s — widow? 

Nerda. 

In the morning I’ll look into 
this. 

II 

R OCQUEL’S senses blurred in 
arriving. He lay down for a few 
seconds on the shadowy grass. It 
was already day — fairly early 
morning; he noticed when he 
climbed to his feet. He could see 
the palace, visible among the trees 
of the vast garden which sur- 
rounded the building. 

Rocquel stood for a moment, 
head thrown back, breathing 
deeply of the air of his native 
planet. A year had seemed a long 
absence. So much had happened. 
Yet the sky of Jana and these 
hills that he had known in his 
lost youth so intimately seemed 
unchanged. Here, during all those 
tremendous days of his absence, 
time had sculptured with a slow 

10 



and exacting chisel. A gentle wind 
blew in Rocquel’s face as he 
started slowly toward the road 
beyond the near trees, the winding 
road that would take him to the 
palace. 

Incredibly, he made it to within 
a hundred yards of the sprawl 
of building before a Jana male 
came suddenly from around some 
trees, saw him and stopped. Roc- 
quel recognized the other at once: 
Jaer Dorrish. Jaer w'as a big 
fellow, bigger than Rocquel, good- 
looking in a swarthy way. His 
eyes narrowed. He seemed to 
brace himself. 

He said arrogantly in the tone 
of one addressing an intruder, 
“What are you doing here — 
stranger?” 

Rocquel walked forward at a 
deliberate pace. He had been 
cautioned to take up his old posi- 
tion before he revealed the new 
facets of his personality. He didn’t 
need the warning — it was implicit 
in the sly act of a person who 
knew him, pretending not to. 

The problem of what one of 
the Dorrish men was doing in 
the Rocquel grounds so early in 
the morning — or ever — he would 
come to later. Right now the de- 
nial of his identity was surpass- 
ingly significant. 

Rocquel said, “Jaer, con- 
sider — do you want me for an 
enemy?” 

This time Jaer Dorrish showed 
his understanding of the situation. 

“By Dilit,” he said exultantly, 
“I’ve caught you unarmed.” 

He drew his sword in a single, 
continuous movement and began 

GALAXY 



V 



to circle Rocquel, apparently not 
quite believing that he need 
merely rush in and slash. His eyes 
speculatively sized up Rocquel's 
condition. 



R OCQUEL backed and simul- 
taneously turned. He paused 
where Jaer had been standing. It 
took him moments to locate con- 
sciously the symbol made by the 
invisible Tizane energy, which he 
had directed to the spot the in- 
stant he saw Jaer. He kicked it 
cautiously, leaning backward so 
that his body would not be at- 
tracted by the symbol. His foot 
tingled unpleasantly — it was a 
feeling of something grabbing at 
him, something very powerful that 
did not quite reach him but only 
clawed the outer threads of his 
clothing, failing to get a good 
hold. Twice he pulled clear of 
it. Presently he was able to step 
over the broken ground without 
experiencing a reaction. 

He was already out of danger 
when Jaer laughed and replaced 
his sword. 

The big male said arrogantly, 
“If one does not threaten, one 
cannot show mercy. You see, 
Rocquel, I expected that you 
would return today. I have had 
observers watching the grounds all 
night so that I could have this 
confrontation with you.” He 
grimaced triumphantly. “I analyze 
that you owe your return to me. 
Because yesterday I arrested the 
human woman, Miliss, and here 
you are this morning, exactly as 
I anticipated. It was a sudden 




HUMANS, GO HOME! 



II 



intuition of mind. You have a 
lot of explaining to do — sir.” 

Jaer was visibly jubilant. He 
waved at somebody behind Roc- 
quel. Rocquel was wary of the 
gesture. In his careful defensive 
maneuvering he had gotten his 
back to the buildings. Finally he 
glanced carefully around and saw 
that Nerda was walking toward 
them. 

As she came near she said, 
“You were not really in danger, 
were you? It showed in your 
manner.” 

Rocquel said, “Not front one 
person.” 

He walked to her and she did 
not resist his kiss. She might as 
well have. Her lips were cool and 
unresponsive. Her passive body 
did not welcome his embrace. 

Rocquel drew back, scowling. 
An old anger against this defiant 
young female rose to gall him. 

“Damn you,” he said, “Aren’t 
you glad to see me?” 

Nerda merely gazed at him 
coolly. 

“I forgot,” said Rocquel, stung. 
“It was a welcome period of rest 
for you. It's difficult for a male 
to remember that Jana females 
do not have feelings.” 

His wife shrugged. 

Rocquel stared at her, curious 
now rather than hostile. Like all 
Jana females, she was icily aloof. 
He had married her in the usual 
fashion by having her father bring 
her to his house. She had subse- 
quently borne him a son and a 
daughter but in the Jana female 
tradition she continued to treat 
him like an intruder in her 

12 



life — whom she must tolerate but 
did not particularly care to have 
around. 

Rocquel scowled jealously. 
“What about Jaer?” 

That brought a reply. 

“I think he has already ex- 
plained his presence. Rather than 
have any further words from him, 
I would prefer to hear your ex- 
planation of your absence.” 

Rocquel rejected explanations. 
“Come along,” he said gruffly. 
“Let us go inside.” 

T HERE were things to do. The 
news of his return would spread 
rapidly. The men in control of 
the council must not be allowed 
too much time to< decide what 
to do about him. There would 
be regents, generals and their 
aides — who would be unhappy at 
the return of the hereditary ruler 
of the army. Before this night 
he must again be recognized as 
entitled by law and right to wield 
the scepter of his sphere. 

He took Nerda’s arm gently. 
The move was calculated. He 
wanted to enter the palace beside 
her, his identity given validity by 
her presence. A year was a long 
time on Jana. Jana males par- 
ticularly had short memories. He 
could not have planned his arrival 
better if he had personally made 
all the arrangements in advance. 

Rocquel had the tocsin sounded 
as soon as he reached the main 
guard station. Shortly the palace 
guard and the servants were 
drawn up in five lines of a hun- 
dred each. He addressed them in 
his deepest baritone, recalling 

GALAXY 



himself to the older men, inviting 
the younger men to remember his 
face and body structure. He 
wanted them to be able to identify 
him under all circumstances. 

He felt a little better when that 
job was done and the people had 
been dismissed to return to their 
duties. But not much better. The 
servants and guards could be 
talked to like a schoolroom full 
of children. But not the officers. 
Not the nobility. 

He had a new, superior — yet 
not at all condescending— attitude 
toward these people. They were 
simple souls. He now understood 
how rapidly Dav and Nliliss were 
rushing Janae into civilization by 
a trial and error system that at- 
tempted to take each man for 
what he was. 

The lower classes were given 
easy tests. Those who showed 
even a modicum of mechanical 
ability were soon placed on 
assembly lines where they per- 
formed one action, then two, then 
several — but never many. For 
decades now some pretty sharp 
mechanics had been coming up 
the line and from their ranks arose 
a new class — engineers. 

The officers and nobility were 
a different breed. Quick to take 
insult, they were truly impervious 
to all but the barest elements of 
education. They had been 
persuaded that being able to read 
and write was a mark of distinc- 
tion but they were never entirely 
convinced. Why, they wanted to 
know grimly, were the lower 
classes also being taught reading 
and writing? The resultant, in-

SEPTEMBER, and the mad, wild 
beauty of the St. LouisCon is over 
(but won't be actually by the 
time you read this). Never mind. 
Traditional ly, in publishing, Sep- 
tember is a good reading month. 
Summer doldrums are over, the 
kids are back in school, everyone 
is thinking in a serious-minded 
way about the long, hard, in- 
tellectual winter ahead. So Sep- 
tember is a big, big publishing 
month. 

WE are celebrating it with 
George MacDonald's very kooky 
Kafkaesque fantasy LILITH. What 
is almost as extraordinary as the 
novel itself is the idea that 
anything as modern as this was 
written back in the I890's by a 
Scottish (sometime) minister of 
advanced years. You'll recognize 
it by the superb Gervasio cover 
of a man in an attic. 



AND in September, s.f.'s major 
novel of the year — STAND ON 
ZANZIBAR, by John Brunner. Not 
an easy book to read (clearly a

finitely stubborn attitude had 
made it necessary to have a dif- 
ferent written language for the 
people — one the upper classes 
didn’t respect — before the nobles 
sullenly allowed their children to 
go to special, separate schools. 

Telling the nobility of his 
return, it seemed to Rocquel, 
would have to be done at an all- 
male dinner in the vast dining 
hall adjoining the even vaster 
jousting room. 

A BOUT mid-morning Dav at last 
felt free to put through a call to 
Nerda. There was a long delay. 
Finally an aide came to the phone. 

He said in a formal tone, “The 
queen wishes me to inform you 
that her lord, Rocquel, has 
returned and, since he will in 
future represent the power of the 
armed forces, her talking to you 
might be misconstrued at this 
stage. That is all, sir.” 

Dav hung up. startled. The 
great Rocquel was home. Where 
had he been? 

The hereditary general had al- 
ways been a male first, his every 
movement and the tenor of his 
being expressing the quiescent 
violence of his powerful, super- 
masculine breed. It seemed an 
unfortunate coincidence for Miliss 
that the deadly, narrowed-eyed 
Jana ruler had returned. Dav di- 
vined that, if a struggle for power 
look place, Miliss might be its 
first victim. 

After some thought Dav phon- 
ed the palace a second time and 
asked for Rocquel. 

Once more he endured delay. 

GALAXY 



At last another aide said, “His 
Excellency, the lord-general Roc- 
quel wishes me to inform you 
that a new law will be pro- 
mulgated tomorrow to the council. 
He invites you to attend the 
council meeting which will be held 
at the slickrock rendezvous.” 

T HE dinner that night shocked 
Rocquel. He had forgotten the 
extreme coarseness of his 
peers — at least it had become 
vague in his mind. An uproar of 
yelling and jesting began as the 
first males arrived. More arrivals 
simply added to the pandemo- 
nium. Things quieted down only 
to a degree when the meal was 
finally served. Plates clanked. 
Forks and knives clattered. Males 
yelled a peculiar type of ac- 
ceptable insult at acquaintances 
farther along a table — insults 
having to do with the jester’s 
belief that the other lacked sexual 
prowess. Such remarks always 
brought bellows of laughter while 
onlookers insultingly urged the 
object of the attack to prove his 
capabilities. 

Yet since humor always probed 
the abyss of a male’s sensitivity 
to criticism, suddenly a word 
would be unacceptable. In a flash 
the aggrieved male was on his 
feet, ragefully demanding 
satisfaction. Moments later the 
two nobles, yelling furiously at 
each other, would stamp out to 
the jousting room and add the 
clash of their steel to the sound 
of the dozens that were already 
there. 

Shortly a scream of outrage an- 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



nounced the first blood had been 
drawn. In the presence of Rocquel 
the custom was that the male ini- 
tially blooded in any way was 
expected to acknowledge defeat. 
Such acknowledgment meant that 
the insult was nullified. But the 
loser who felt himself still ag- 
grieved could demand a later 
reckoning away from the palace 
grounds. 

It was of this assembled group 
of mad creatures that Rocquel 
demanded silence when the eating 
was completed. Getting it, he gave 
the explanation for his absence 
that had been suggested to him — a 
religious withdrawal, a year of 
wandering among the people as 
a mendicant, a time of self- 
searching and thorough selfless- 
ness, of deliberate, temporary ab- 
dication of power. 

He concluded his fabricated 
account. 

“I saw our people in their daily 
actions. I lived among them, sur- 
vived on their generosity and can 
report that the Jana world is in- 
deed a worthy one.” 

He received a prolonged ova- 
tion. But a bad moment came 
when he presently went into the 
jousting room where the guests 
had drifted after his talk. 

A voice grated beside his ear, 
“Your sword, sire.” 

Rocquel experienced a blank 
instant as he realized he was being 
challenged. 

He swung around as of old 
in a swift, automatic defense ac- 
tion. His blade came out, weaving, 
before he saw that his challenger 
was Jaer Dorrish.

OF SYMBOLS 




Jana is a planet with one large 
continent and a number of small 
islands. All the rest is ocean. 

The continent is about t w o 
thousand miles square and from time 
immemorial scores of powerful tribes 
of the Janae have fought each other 
to one uneasy truce after another. 

Then came two human beings, Dav 
and Miliss. They set up headquarters 
in a big, sprawling White House— by 
the river. 

Their civilizing task had been to 
bring the warring tribes up to the 
status of city states, then to unions of 
cities and finally to one state for the 
entire continent, headed by t h e 
hereditary general of the largest of 
the original tribes. At the same time 
they were to create a scientific 
civilization of a kind that never ex- 
isted during similar natural develop- 
ments on other planets. 

In effect, 4000 years of Jana 
s o c i o -political development was 
telescoped into 400 through the use 
of Symbols familiar to Man through 
centuries of infancy but finally refin- 
ed to powerful physical forces of 
instant effectiveness. 

Normally a Symbol motivates. 
During a span of time millions of 
minds align in support of a single 
idea. At its most intense the idea is so 
strongly held by so many persons 
that rebellion against it becomes a 
mortal offense. 

Study of the chemistry of such an 
alignment of minds behind an idea 
had revealed two common de-

and MAN 



• • • 



nominators. For each Symbol the 
body actually manufactured a 
substance which varied slightly from 
Symbol to Symbol. The variations 
were expressed in different codings 
and energy charges. 

The energy charges were the sec- 
ond common denominator when re- 
produced artificially— and ampli- 
fied— they showed as palpable force 
fields. Such fields had only a mild 
effect on individuals who believed in 
the Symbol. But they became pro- 
gressively more palpable when ex- 
perienced by persons who resisted 
the Symbol. In the presence of 
someone who was totally against the 
Symbol the field attained such an 
intensity that it acquired a spinning 
motion — at which stage it could be 
dangerous to life. 

Already begun on Jana was a 
special type of parliament: The 
Chosen. This body would eventually 
show its remarkable qualities but 
was currently restricted by the power 
of the nobles. 

The elective system was simple. 
The electorate was divided into 
groups of a hundred voters. Each 
group sent a representative to an 
Elected Board. Each Elected Board 
consisted of a hundred delegates 
and, in turn, elected members to 
Elected Committees, who selected 
The Chosen. 

Each level group hod its political, 
local or national duties which, for the 
time being, were subordinated to the 
automatic privileges of the nobles. 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 




Rocquel poised, sword ready. 
He gazed questioningly into the 
dark, cynical eyes of his enemy. 

From somewhere in the sea of 
faces surrounding them, from out 
of the diminishing curtain of 
sound — diminishing as more 
males grew aware of what was 
happening — Rocquel was aware 
of a top officer speaking sharply. 

“Jaer — have you forgotten? 
You have to state your reason 
when you challenge the crown. 
And it must be a reason ac- 
ceptable to the majority present.” 

“My reason,” said Jaer in his 
deliberate fashion, “is that story 
of where he said he was during 
the past year—” 

The officer who had spoken 
walked forward. He was grave, 
fortyish, narrow-eyed. 

“Is it a matter of misun- 
derstanding the story or of reject- 
ing it?” 

Silence had settled over the 
room and the words made an echo 
into the distances of that cavern- 
ous space. The question visibly 
gave Jaer pause. His expression 
showed his comprehension that a 
to-the-death had to follow any 
total challenge of a noble’s word. 

Abruptly he laughed and put 
away his sword. 

He said, “I think I shall ask 
privately for a clarification. If 
Rocquel decides what I have to 
say is truly a reason for a 
challenge — then we shall have our 
bout. Perhaps tomorrow.” He 
thereupon stepped close to Roc- 
quel and said in a low insolent 
voice. “Your excellency— the 
coincidence of my arresting Miliss 

18 



and your prompt return needs to 
be explained. If the two are not 
related — you will, of course, have 
no objection to my plans for 
disposing of her.” 

Rocquel said evenly, “If you 
are operating within the frame of 
the law — ” 

“The law is what the council 
decides,” replied Jaer arrogantly. 
“Do I have your word that you 
will not interfere — in view of my 
suspicions?” 

“There will be a new law,” 
said Rocquel in a formal tone. 
“Within the frame of that law — I 
shall not interfere.” 

He walked away, leaving Jaer 
Dorrish with a black scowl on 
his face and a query about the 
“new law” unspoken on his purs- 
ed lips. In his mind Rocquel read 
the thought that this very night 
he must attend on the human 
woman — must force her before 
any protecting law was passed. 

Yet Rocquel could not be sure 
he had read correctly even when 
Jaer left the party within minutes. 

N ERDA was waiting for Rocquel 
when he came in. He was late, 
very late. As soon as he en- 
tered — and after he had nodded 
to her — she retreated to her 
dressing room and began to get 
ready for bed. He watched her 
shadow through the translucent 
door. A regretful thought passed 
through his mind that he should 
have given her permission to retire 
without waiting for his return. 

Presently he rejected the 
thought of such leniency. Ac- 
cording to Jana law a wife could 

GALAXY 



not undress at night to go to bed 
until her husband gave per- 
mission. She could lie down with 
her clothes on. She could even 
sleep though that was frowned on. 
She could go to bed before his 
return only with his written per- 
mission or if a doctor stated in 
writing or in the presence of 
witnesses that she was ill. 

The rules seemed harsh. But 
Rocquel had read the ancient doc- 
uments containing the results of 
studies made of Jana female 
behavior prior to the passing of 
the stringent laws and there was 
no question. Jana females would 
associate with males only when 
forced. A female, unforced, would 
promptly move off by herself and 
remain that way all her life. 

The facts had been set jdown 
by amazed historians who named 
names and places. The truths of 
the long-ago experiments in 
allowing freedom to females were 
attested to by famous people of 
Jana history. There was no point 
in repeating the experience in 
modern times. 

Jana females had no maternal 
instinct and particularly detested 
their male children. It had been 
a sad thing to read some of the 
comments made by females during 
the free period. 

A male child will eventually 
become a Jana male — that most 
detestable being. And so any 
charming childlike attributes he 
may have are an illusion. 

Another female had been in 
favor of the race’s dying out — be- 
cause its continuance required 
that Jana males also survive, to 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



which she was “totally opposed.” 

What could males do, con- 
fronted by such females? 

They had done it. 

The laws were just and as kind 
as they could be. A female could 
complain if she suffered any ill- 
treatment — and receive an imme- 
diate hearing from a court. No 
expense was spared by the State 
to protect her from a brutal hus- 
band. 

In return she must do her duty 
by her husband and her children. 
Since she had no feeling about 
her functions the law prescribed 
her exact routine. 

Obviously even the hereditary 
general could not lightly alter 
either the custom or the law. Ner- 
da came to bed and presently he 
gave her permission to sleep. 

She slept — it seemed instantly. 

Ill 

Miliss heard a key in the lock 
of her cell. She had not undressed. 
She sat up in the rough bunk and 
watched curiously as a manlike 
figure, waving a long flashlight, 
unlocked the door and entered. 

From the vast shadowy size of 
him she divined his identity. But 
not until he deliberately raised the 
light and beamed it into his face 
did she recognize .lacr Derrish. 

His face, like that of all Jana 
males, was too long, too much 
given over to nose. But the skin 
was a clear reddish color and 
smooth. 

She was not repelled. 

At least, she thought, the Janae 
were a distinctly humanlike breed. 



19 



for which — in view of the fate 
she sensed was in store for 
her — she was thankful. It did not 
occur to her to formulate in her 
mind the mental pattern that 
would activate a thought amplifier 
in the house where she and Dav 
lived — no help for her from that 
rigid mind, she decided. 

But she did have a purpose 
of her own adaptable to this sit- 
uation. It had been growing on 
her all day. The male stepped 
briskly across the cell toward her 
cot. 

She said hurriedly, “I've been 
thinking about what you told me 
last night — your prediction that 
Rocquel would return as a conse- 
quence of my arrest. And it hap- 
pened. He did come back.” 

Jaer stopped his forward move- 
ment. He did not reply. Her 
next w'ords quivered on the tip 
of her tongue but remained 
unspoken. 

Miliss w'as startled. She had an 
enormous sensitivity to small 
signals. He had been coming for- 
ward with that Jana male ar- 
rogance, his whole manner vi- 
brating with the message that he 
would not be denied. 

And now he stood still. And 
the way he stood telegraphed un- 
certainty. 

“Is something w'rong?” Miliss 
asked. 

More silence, a sense of darker 
emotions. She was astounded. 
Jana males w'ere reputed to have 
a peculiar calm humor in the rape 
situation. Both humor and savoir- 
faire required expression in w'ords, 
not silence. 



During the strange pause, like 
a suspension of time in the cell, 
she had nevertheless become 
aware of the night and the prison. 
A time had been on Jana when 
there had been no prisons, only 
a few compounds where “ene- 
mies” were kept prior to execu- 
tion. 

On Jana, for more millennia 
than she cared to recall, people 
had been tolerated — or executed. 
No middle situation had Ted. 
This and similar prisons were ac- 
tually a great victory for less 
harsh attitudes. 

So the sounds of a vast life 
around her were presently heart- 
ening to Miliss. She heard 
metallic clanks, distant throat 
raspings, Jana males snarling in 
their sleep and occasional echoes 
of faraway voices. Sounds of 
many prisoners. The Nunbrid 
prison was large. It was filled 
with people who would be tried 
in court for their offenses and 
who were not subject — as had 
once been the case — to the com- 
pulsive masculine rage of some 
intolerant noble. 

A feeling of peaceful ac- 
complishment was settling over 
Miliss. Dav and she had civilized 
these people. 

Jaer finally spoke. 

“I had a sudden insight — and 
I’m having another one.” 

His voice was strained, not 
really calm. She sensed in its tone 
an advantage for her. Somehow 
the situation was no longer as 
dangerous as it had been. This 
male was genuinely disturbed. 

By what? 



20 



GALAXY 



M ILISS pressed her own pur- 
pose upon him. 

“Is that all you can say about 
the coincidence of your prediction 
and Rocquel’s return?” 

“I’m still wondering about it 
myself,” was the grim answer. 

The threat was in his voice 
again. She rushed past it. 

“Don't you realize the im- 
possibility of such an unsupported 
insight — the odds against its bar- 
ing truth?” 

For a tense moment in the 
unyielding closeness of the cell, 
in the darkness broken only by 
a flashlight that sometimes 
pointed at her and sometimes at 
the metal bars — and occasionally, 
briefly. at Jaer himself — she 
thought that he would ac- 
knowledge reason and dismiss the 
subject. But Jana nobles, she 
shortly decided in despair, were 
not up to her kind of strict logic. 
His mien told her he was ac- 
cepting his intuition. 

For a long moment, while he 
stood there silently, her fear grew. 

Then : “There’s only one ex- 
planation,” he said slowly. “Roc- 
quel was in hiding with you and 
Dav while he was gone.” 

“No. That's absolutely not true. 
If you’re acting on that assump- 
tion — you're in danger.” 
“Danger?” 

“There’s a hidden force at 
work. It can strike at you if you 
ignore it. In fact, it probably has 
already struck— or how could you 
have had two insights?” 

“You’re trying to alarm me,” 
said Jaer harshly. “And a Jana 
male cannot be frightened.” 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



“But he can think about how 
best to survive,” countered Miliss. 
“At least — ” she couldn’t help the 
biting remark — “the males 1 know 
always do.” 

Again silence filled the cell. 
The light winked off. Into that 
darkness and that silence Miliss 
projected what seemed to her to 
be the only possible explanation. 

“What has happened means 
that you've been programed,” 
she said. 

“Programed? I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“It's impossible that you could 
have a second major intuition 
unless somebody had installed it 
in your mind under mechanical 
hypnosis.” 

“I just bad it. It’s my own 
thought.” 

“It’s not your owm thought. 
You're being manipulated,” She 
broke off. “Don't you see, you 
couldn’t possibly — being a Jana 
noble — have all by yourself pre- 
dicted Rocquel’s return on the 
basis of my arrest. It's too radical 
and fantastic a prediction. Yet it 
came true. And now another one? 
Impossible.” 

Once more he was silent. The 
flashlight was on again, its beam 
tilted casually, showing his 
scowling face, narrow'ed eyes and 
lower lip pushed up. He was 
evidently having unpleasant, 
calculating thoughts. 

Abruptly he asked, “Why did 
you and Dav separate?” 

Miliss hesitated, then said, “He 
w'as more and more adopting the 
attitudes and behavior of the Jana 
male — and treating me as Jana 

21 



males treat Jana females. I had 
had enough years ago — but we 
were alone here, two human 
beings, the last of our kind in 
this area. So 1 tried to make my 
peace with the situation as Jana 
females have done for so long.” 

T HERE was actually more to it 
than that. It had, of course, 
kept occurring to her that the fre- 
quent despair she had felt over 
Dav might in fact be the death 
wish that had destroyed the hu- 
man race. She had fought against 
her growing embitterment. until, 
one day not too long since, she 
had had an insight of her own. 

Human males were, had always 
been, exactly as vicious as the 
Janae. But human women, having 
their own maternal instinct to 
satisfy, had endlessly compromis- 
ed with the egotistical villains. 
The need for motherhood had put 
a fortunate — for the men and the 
race — veil over a woman’s 
awareness of the impossible true 
nature of the beasts. 

Once she had recognized the 
thought, leaving Dav was only a 
matter of a brief period of 
rethinking her reasons, and con- 
vincing herself finally. 

Jaer’s voice came grimly. 

He said, “1 didn’t have my first 
insight until after I had arrested 
you. I’ve had my second one in 
your presence. So you’re doing 
this to me. By Dilit, woman—” 
Miliss said urgently, “Tell me 
what your second insight is.” 
When he had told her she said, 
“But that’s ridiculous — what good 
does that do me?” 

22 



Jaer must have recognized her 
logic. He stood very still. 

After a long pause he said 
slowly, “But 1 did get both 
thoughts in your presence, so 
someone knows I’m here.” 

His manner showed unease. 
The implication of danger was 
visibly penetrating his awareness. 
Miliss sensed her advantage. 

She said, “What is so mean- 
ingless about these insights is that 
I detect that your purpose in ar- 
resting me was entirely personal. 
You saw a possibility of challeng- 
ing the throne and simultaneously 
obtaining me as a mistress — ” 

“Silence, woman.” Jaer sound- 
ed alarmed. “1 have never desired 
the throne — that’s treason. I’d 
better leave before I damage you 
and ruin my case against you in 
court. But don't think I’m through 
with you.” 

The light winked out. Quick 
steps sounded. A metal door 
clicked open and clanged shut. 

She heard him retreating along 
a corridor. And realized that she 
was almost as shaken as he. 

That second insight, she told 
herself, is absolutely mad. 

But for the first time in many 
years she slept poorly. 

IV 

HE next day. 

Shortly after sunrise the 
council members began cycling up 
to the meeting place at the begin- 
ning of the slickrock range, seven 
miles west of Nunbrid. By the 
time Rocquel arrived on his new 
motorbike, Dav and eight Jana 

GALAXY 



males of high rank were already 
there. The human sat on his bike 
off to one side but the Jana nobles 
were impatiently gunning their 
motors, visibly anxious to get 
started on their hazardous 
meeting-in-motion. 

Rocquel was greeted by a num- 
ber of insulting but quite good- 
natured eomments about his 
overweight machine. He respond- 
ed with well-placed sneers about 
overcautious small-bike riders. 
But he was curious. There had 
been changes in design during his 
absence. Wheeling around with 
the casual daring of an expert 
cyclist, he made quick, searching 
examination of the mount of 
each council member to see what 
time and manufacturers had 
wrought. 

As always for slickrocking, all 
the motorcycles were small, tough, 
and light. But Rocquel noticed 
that three of the bikes were 
smaller than he remembered — not 
more than lOOcc., perhaps even 
90 or 80 — compared to his 175 
cc. machine. 

He questioned the three owners 
about it. He was still getting 
boastful replies when Jaer Dorrish 
and a sly-eyed air-force officer 
roared up and charged their metal 
steeds up the first incline. 

Jaer yelled, ‘‘Meeting called to 
order — ” 

A number of nobles uttered 
wild cries, gunned their motors 
and took off in pursuit of the 
latecomers. 

Dav brought up the rear. 

Moments later everyone was in 
motion and the meeting of the 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



supreme council of Jana was in 
session. 

Jn the old days — before the 
machines — a king had held his 
council meetings while riding a 
tamed, high-backed Mesto-beast. 
The Mestos were dangerous, cun- 
ning creatures, always, looking for 
an opportunity to upset their 
riders, and Mcsto-riding was, ac- 
cordingly, considered great fun. 
But a Mesto simply could not 
cover the distances or go over 
the rough and beautiful slickrock 
country. 

At first the nobles climbed 
steadily, strung out unevenly, 
bobbing up and down over domes, 
knobs and ridges, skipping at a 
good clip over the almost glass- 
smooth, steel-hard straights. Roc- 
quel, coming up from behind, kept 
edging up to Jaer and finally had 
his bike racing along parallel to 
the bright green machine of the 
big male. 

“What’s on the agenda?” he 
yelled. 

Jaer’s answering cry brought up 
the subject of Miliss. He made 
a slashing gesture with one hand, 
cutting the air with it as if it 
were a blade, then showed his 
teeth in a grimacing smile. 

He shouted, “1 propose that 
this woman be put to death.” 

“On what grounds?” Rocquel 
roared back, surprised. 

Jaer’s suggestion was discour- 
teous in view of the fact that 
Dav was at the council meeting. 
Or was it possible that Jaer had 
not yet seen Dav? 

As the day dragged by Jaer’s 
unawareness of Dav began to 

23 



seem less and less a coincidence. 
But Jaer’s intentness on Miliss 
and on the new law might have 
accounted for his attitude toward 
Dav. 



D AV anticipated a crisis as soon 
as he was told what was on the 
agenda and the nature of the new 
law. 

The law itself required no spe- 



cial explanation for him. It was 
he who had proposed the idea 
of a constitutional monarchy to 
a resistant Rocquel. The very next 
day — a year ago — the powerful 
Jana leader had gone off on a 
religious hegira. 

Now he was back, acceptant. 

Mentally, Dav triggered a 
thought amplifier. It in turn chan- 
neled power into a relay that 
blazed one of the symbols. 




24 



GALAXY 



The symbol of a Constitutional 
Monarchy. 

That done, he considered with 
mirthless good humor the pro- 
posal to execute Miliss. Ironic that 
jaer was planning to put on trial 
a person already doomed. 

Should Jaer be told? 

But when Dav finally joined 
the group the crisis came so 
rapidly that there w'as no time 
to mention anything. 



The council members stopped 
in front of a big cave, at 
the 9000-foot level. Here the great 
nobles of Jana sat on bikes with 
engines idling while they gulped 
breakfast. 

Rocquel was aware of an ugly, 
throaty sound from Jaer. He spun 
around and saw Dav easing his 
bike into the clearing. Dav came 
to a full stop. 

Beside Rocquel, Jaer let out

a bellow and gunned his motor. 

T HAT night Roequel described 
the day to Nerda, then asked 
curiously, “What do you think 
happened to Jaer? You know 
more about what Dav can do than 
anyone.” 

Conversations between them 
were not common. She was not 
required by law or custom to 
speak to him as long as she per- 
formed her wifely duties. He was 
not surprised when she did not 
reply. But he deduced from the 
thoughtful expression on her face 
that she was considering the mat- 
ter and would eventually give him 
an answer. 

Yet it was morning before she 
answered. 

“A symbol,” she said then, “as 
Dav has described it, represents 
a real thing or thought. It is not 
itself the thing or the thought — ” 
Roequel waited, uneasily aware 
that he was being presented with 
a concept that might be too subtle 
for a Jana noble — too subtle even 
for himself, despite his past year 
of indoctrination. 

. Nerda continued, “When the 
symbol representing constitutional 
monarchy is finally a part of the 
thinking of millions of Janae, the 
force of it in all those minds will 
maintain such a system for 
decades under normal cir- 
cumstances — or at least until 
another symbol replaces it, which, 
of course, is happening very 
rapidly with Dav and Miliss forc- 
ing us into civilization.” 

Roequel felt helpless before her 
explanation. She seemed to un- 

26 



derstand what she was saying and 
he didn’t. 

We males of the nobility are 
really no longer a part of what 
is happening. 

It was discouraging but he 
persisted. 

“What I saw,” he said, “was 
Jaer’s motorcycle stop — not 

short — but as if it ran into an 
elastic wall that took the full force 
of his forward impetus and gently 
flung him back. He ended up on 
the ground. But he was not hurt.” 
“He struck the symbol,” said 
Nerda. “These symbols have be- 
come progressively more violent 
in their reaction. The most violent 
so far is the symbol of a constitu- 
tional monarchy.” 

He said, “You say the symbol. 
But what was the force involved?” 
“The force of the symbol.” Her 
expression showed her awareness 
of his bewilderment. “Don't you 
see?” she urged. “All those 
millions of people who believe.” 
What Roequel was seeing was 
that he had made a mistake in 
asking her for her opinion. He 
wanted to say that nobody yet 
believed in the new law. It would 
not even be publicly announced 
until later this morning. But his 
awful feeling leaped past that idea 
to the more personal awareness 
that he had lowered himself in 
her eyes. He recalled with a sink- 
ing sensation the Jana male con- 
viction that if a female even once 
gained a genuine advantage over 
her husband it was the end of 
their relationship. Nothing the 
male did after that could repair 
the damage. 



GALAXY 



Fighting for recovery, he nod- 
ded and said aloud, “1 see. Your 
many conversations with Dav 
have been very educational and 
valuable for both of us. I con- 
gratulate you. It’s a difficult con- 
cept.” 

He divined from an odd look 
in her eyes that she saw through 
his verbal stratagem. 

She said slowly, “We mustn’t 
expect too much from a constitu- 
tional monarchy in terms of 
change in the passions. Rule of 
law merely regulates a society in 
a more orderly fashion than 
absolutism. An accused individual 
is no longer subject to arbitrary 
judgments but is allowed time by 
the courts to defend himself 
within the frame of the law. Yet 
in the end he may pay the same 
penalty.” She concluded: “And 
so, to answer your question of 
last night — I believe we shall see 
how Jaer was affected by the way 
he allows the trial of Miliss to 
be conducted.” 

Rocquel, who was still striving 
for recovery from his fateful error 
in having this discussion with her 
at all, said in his most matter-of- 
fact voice, “What I’m curious 
about is the nature of the charges 
he intends to level against her — ” 

T HOSE charges surprised Dav 
more than Rocquel, who still 
nursed memories of his year away. 
He had learned something about 
humans during his absence and 
could even control a certain sym- 
bol himself — without, he realized, 
really understanding it. 

Miliss was accused of being an

enemy alien, illegally resident on 
Jana; spying for an invading alien 
force from space; conspiring to 
pretend to be a member of a 
decadent race when in fact she 
was a member of a superior, dom- 
inant race set down among primi- 
tives. 

She was also charged with har- 
boring criminal intent. 

Dav scanned the headlines un- 
believingly, standing in the rain 
in front of a newsstand. Janae 
in colorful raincoats drifted past 
him as — directed by a guide sen- 
tence on page one — he turned to 
the editorial page. There he read " 
in the language of Low Jana: 

In an unprecedented action 
the government today chal- 
lenged the right to live on 
this planet of the two relics of 
an older civilization. Almost 
melodramatic charges of con- 
spiracy were leveled at the 
couple but only the woman 
has been arrested. 

We propose to leave to the 
courts the resolution of the 
legal tangle implicit in this 
arrest but find ourselves 
thoughtful about the matter 
on a strictly theoretical basis. 

Explorers have recently 
found isolated tribes of Janae 
still living in stone-age cul- 
tures. Contact with our supe- 
rior civilization was in- 
acted as a depressant on the 
aspirations and mores of the 
backward peoples and they 
have seemed unable to 
recover as a group. 



27 



Until today's governmental 
action we have known a re- 
verse condition with the two 
human beings resident on 
Jana. They represent an older 
culture — one that apparently 
had virtually died out for 
reasons never analyzed. Such 
a decadent culture, even 
though it had clearly attained 
heights of scientific achieve- 
ment far in advance of what 
is available on Jana, has not 
acted as depressant on spirit 
of the Janae. 

Matters to be adjudicated 
by the courts include the fol- 
lowing: Are Dav and Miliss 
representatives of a superior 
culture that is merely pre- 
tending to be decadent, so 
that the normal depressant 
impact upon an inferior cul- 
ture is avoided? If so, does 
their presence here come 
under the heading of an alien 
conspiracy? And can such a 
purpose be interpreted as an 
invasion? 

T HE account was perceptive. It 
indicated the presence of a high- 
ly intelligent professional class 
already in existence in Nunbrid 
and hundreds of other cities. The 
lower-class Janae had clearly 
matured more rapidly than their 
hereditary rulers. Yet the tone of 
the editorial was neither inflam- 
matory nor antagonistic. In fact, 
it showed respect for the govern- 
ment and awareness of the mean- 
ing of the new law. 

28 



Dav's own thought ceased at 
that point. He had been aware 
that passersby were glancing at 
him. Now, suddenly, one big male 
stopped, uttered an explosive oath 
and lifted an arm threateningly, 
'as if to strike. 

Dav shrank back involuntarily. 
The male grew instantly con- 
temptuous and kicked at him. 
Dav, alert now, dodged with easy 
skill but dropped his newspaper. 
The big fellow scooped it up from 
the wet sidewalk and pounded the 
soggy sheets. 

He roared, “You've got to be 
nothing. You're the last of a 
vanished race. A nothing! A 
nothing!” 

Dav retreated. He found a side 
street, slipped into its darker, 
damp distances, heading for 
home. As he approached the edge 
of the city he heard a sound in 
the night ahead of him, a swelling 
murmur of ugly voices. Then, out 
in the open spaces between 
himself and his house, he saw 
a huge crowd carrying torches. 

Startled, Dav withdrew from 
the open area and headed for a 
small house on a nearby street. 
The place was actually a secret 
entrance to the big white mansion. 
Long ago, when Jana had been 
more primitive, unpleasant inci- 
dents had occurred. The secret 
access had often proved useful. 

He made his way safely through 
the connecting tunnel to the big 
house and from its interior gazed 
out at the crowd through a 
viewplate. The plate magically 
dissolved the night and the rain, 
showing a dull day-view of the 

GALAXY 



large grounds in front of the 
house. 

At first look the mob seemed 
even huger than he had estimated. 
Dav shook his head sadly. The 
pattern was the same as it had 
once been on old Earth. At the 
top was the hereditary hierarchy. 
Next came a law-abiding middle- 
class of people. At the bot- 
tom seethed the vast mass of the 
unthinking. 

The hierarchy was semi- 
psychotic, murderous, subjective. 
And the middle class was still 
relatively new and unaware of its 
future power. The mob was com- 
pletely duped. 

Dav observed with relief that 
several hundred troops patrolled 
an area between him and the 
angry crowd. An officer spoke 
through a loudspeaker system, 
addressing the mob. 

“Go home. The rule of law 
shall prevail. Go home. If these 
people are spies they will be judg- 
ed by the law. Go home — ” 

The frequently repeated ad- 
monition began to have its effect 
toward midnight. Dav saw that 
there were fewer people outside 
and more were drifting back 
toward the city. But it was nearly 
two in the morning before, feeling 
that the danger was over, he went 
to bed. 

Lying there he rejected the ac- 
cusations against Miliss and 
himself with little more than a 
moment’s consideration. 

It was true, as the newspaper 
editorial had pointed out, that 
primitives had in the past suffered 
psychic and racial disaster as a 

HUMANS, GO .HOME! 



result of being exposed abruptly 
to a superior culture. And, con- 
ceivably, somebody might mer- 
cifully evolve a more systematic 
approach to the problem. 

But the mentors would know. 
That had to be. It would be 
absolutely ridiculous if Miliss and 
he weren’t aware of their own 
realities. 

All these hundreds of years of 
ignorance on so vital a point? 

Impossible. 

The truth was that simple — and 
obvious. Nearly four hundred 
empty years made a weight of 
time in his mind that no words 
and no Jana accusation could 
penetrate. 

He had no trouble sleeping. 

V 

R OCQIJEL had stayed in the 
palace communications center 
during the period of threat against 
Dav. Several times he spoke 
directly to the commanding officer 
of the troops patrolling the 
grounds. 

At last, weary and a little guilty 
at having been out late again, 
he went to his apartment. The 
bedroom was dark as he en- 
tered — and he had an instant, 
awful intuition. 

He flicked on the light and 
stood confused and shaken. Nerda 
was in bed, undressed under the 
sheets. Her eyes were closed. Her 
breathing came with the regularity 
of sleep. 

Rocqucl's thought flashed back 
to their conversation of the morn- 
ing and to his sudden feeling that 
he had ruined himself with her. 



29 



His inability to grasp the meaning 
of the symbol idea troubled him 
again. 

Standing beside his sleeping 
wife, he visualized the reper- 
cussions of her rebellion if it were 
ever found out. His absence had 
shaken the throne and he had 
returned too recently to have fully 
recovered his power and position. 
He had divined an uneasiness in 
the nobility — it would take a little 
while before those suspicious, 
violent beings were reassured that 
the new law was not a direct 
threat. 

And if they found out that he 
was so weak that he could not 
control his wife — Instantly an 
old impulse propelled him toward 
her sleeping body. His hands and 
jaws clenched with the automatic 
effort that would shove her 
in a single thrust out of the far 
side of the bed. 

He poised before the act, sud- 
denly gripped and held by a 
thought and feeling new to him. 

He had been about to act on 
the Jana male attitude. But was 
Nerda justified in her rebellion? 
Was the old way the way women 
should be treated? Had his 
analysis of her reason for what 
she had done been accurate? 

A flash of an old male paranoia 
darkened his face and mind — the 
absolute conviction that Nerda 
was doing this because another 
male had gotten to her. 

Dav, the human? 

Some portion of Rocquel’s 
mind recognized the total irra- 
tionality of the thought — recog- 
nized that if it were true Jana fe- 

30 



males would not associate with 
males of their own free will, they 
obviously did not betray their hus- 
bands. He was also aware that 
Dav, who had an unlimited sense 
of personal responsibility, would 
not have taken advantage of the 
queen’s year of “widowhood.” 

The recognition and awareness 
were not enough for his fevered 
brain, alive with brutal images. 
He had to know. 

He turned and walked out of 
the room. Within minutes he was 
part of a motorcycle army unit 
roaring through the night streets 
of Nunbrid toward the military 
prison where Miliss was confined. 

T HE long, bleak concrete corri- 
dors of the prison echoed to his 
footsteps and those of his guards. 
The light carried by the prison’s 
officer-of-the-night was bright 
enough but it cast wavering shad- 
ows. 

In that uneven brightness, Roc- 
quel noted the gray drabness of 
this prison world, and some of 
the singleness of his purpose soft- 
ened. The thought came to him 
that Miliss had been held here 
now for several days and that 
this was wrong. 

He could do nothing about it 
under the new law but within 
himself he felt a deep anger 
against Jaer. 

The rage was brief. It ended 
as they reached Miliss’ cell — and 
there she was. Rocquel went in 
alone, his guards retreating, wait- 
ing. 

Their first moments together 
were ordinary. Miliss’ surprise and 

GALAXY 



pleasure when she recognized him, 
then her puzzlement that he 
should come at so late an hour 
gave him his opening. 

He asked her the question: 
Why had she and Dav separated? 

The woman was startled. She 
sensed the dark purpose in 
him — who had always been so 
friendly to her and with whom 
she had communicated so well in 
the past. 

After a moment, realizing that 
delay was unwise, she gave him 
Dav’s diagnosis — that she had 
gone into the death tiling that 
had destroyed man. She deemed 
it the best reply, considering all 
possibilities. 

Her answer and its deadly 
implications for her shocked him 
out of his madness. She explained 
in greater detail. 

Rocquel said, “Then what 
you are saying is that you acted 
out of some parallel to the type 
of emotion used by people who 
actually did have the death thing. 
You did this consciously, knowing 
Dav would believe it was in fact 
the death thing.” 

“I think that’s what I did,” 
Miliss replied. She added quickly; 
“The death thing is subtle. One 
can fool oneself.” 

Rocquel persisted, “But as far 
as you’re concerned, you’re not 
really dying?” 

“As far as I know I'm not.” 
Rocquel considered that in a 
gathering amazement. 

Finally: “But why aren’t you 
doing something about getting out 
of this prison? You shouldn’t be 
here.” 



“What can I do?” 

“Don’t you have any protection 
of your own?” 

“Nothing,” she said, “but the 
symbols so far activated. Except 
for a few hand weapons and 
mobile energy units, most of 
which we’ve given to the Janae, 
that’s all we have.” 

“What about other — later- 
symbols?” 

“Their time is not yet,” said 
Miliss. “They wouldn't work— not 
for Jana.” 

Rocquel sighed. 

But, he wanted to say, Dav 
used the power of millions of 
believers in a constitutional 
monarchy before they ever believ- 
ed in it — in fact, before they even 
knew about it. Why not use the 
power of millions of believers in 
some future symbol before they 
ever believe in it.? 

He did not ask the question. 
The concept of any symbol was 
beyond his ability to grasp. He 
realized humbly that he was a 
Jana nobleman of a somewhat 
simple nature and that the year 
he had spent aboard the earth 
battleship — the time he had 
described to no one — had been 
really like some tribal king's be- 
ing — entertained — if that was the 
right word — by traders or scien- 
tists from a superior civilization. 
Being kindly disposed, they had 
been anxious not to hurt his 
feelings — but to them he had been 
a nothing. His status had been 
meaningless except insofar as they 
had a policy of using native kings 
in their interplanetary welfare 
w'ork. 



HUMANS, GO HOME! 



31 



Nonetheless, he tried again to 
reach understanding. 

At his request Miliss explained 
the power of a symbol once more. 
But it didn’t penetrate. 

We thick-skulled males. 

HA ND the ridiculous thing,” he 
it explained his failure to Miliss, 
“is that I myself actually have 
control of a symbol — ” 

He stopped. It was an ad- 
mission that he would have made 
to no other living person — only 
to this one individual with whom 
he had always felt able to speak 
freely. 

He finished lamely, "Of course, 
that was given to me as a protec- 
tion.” 

He stopped again because of 
the look on her face — intent, avid, 
seeking, startled, unbelieving but 
finally believing. 

Miliss whispered, “Who gave 
you control of that symbol?” 
“Human beings,” Rocquel said 
simply. 

She sank back. She seemed to 
cringe on the cot as if, like 
a mental patient, she were wrack- 
ed by a psychic disease that con- 
tracted her body, curling it, twist- 
ing her head to one side. 

Finally she said, “Then Jaer’s 
intuitions, accusations, may be 
true. There are human beings out 
there — ” She suddenly broke off, 
breathless. “Tell me exactly where 
you were, what you saw — ” 
Rocquel described his year on 
tire battleship. 

She whispered, “There were 
both men and women?” 

“Yes. It was a community of 

32 



several thousand, I would say.” 
"They never landed anywhere?” 
“Not that I was aware of.” 
He sighed. “But it was such a 
big ship. I saw only what ap- 
peared on the visual screens in 
the sections where I was permitted 
to wander. They didn’t teach me 
the language. 1 only heard what 
the interpreting machines said to 
me.” He considered possibilities. 
“Landing parties could have gone 
down to planets without my 
knowing it.” 

“It was one of these humans 
that taught you control of a sym- 
bol?” 

"Yes.” 

Miliss persisted: “But what was 
it supposed to do? If Jaer had 
actually slashed at you with his 
sword — what would have hap- 
pened to him?” 

Rocquel didn’t know. 

He explained slowly, “They 
warned me to be careful with 
it — because if I wasn't it would 
hook on to me, too.” He added: 
“When 1 set it up against Jaer 
I could feel it tugging at me sort 
of like — ” he paused, grop- 
ing — “maybe like a magnet.” 

“But what is it a symbol of?” 
Miliss asked. 

Rocquel had no idea. 

She went on, baffled: “It must 
be drawing its energy from some 
meaningful idea on another 
planet — since we didn’t sense 
anything here. But what could it 
be?” No answer came to her and 
she asked, “You still have control 
of it?” 

He nodded. 

“Did they say they would let 

GALAXY 



you maintain it permanently?” 
Rocquel gazed at her unhap- 
pily. ”1 can't remember. I was 
told something— but each time I 
think I’m going to recall it, it 
fades.” 

"That sounds like close-to- 
the-surface programing.” Miliss 
nodded. "As if whatever it relates 
to might happen at any time. So 
we must be near a crisis.” She 
added, obviously thinking out 
loud, that only a symbol could 
act with subtle or powerful 
influence over distances. She 
finished: “It must be very 

personal to you, which in itself 
is unusual. For example, if I could 
do what you have described — I 
could get out of this prison.” 

M ILISS’ second admission of 
helplessness focused Rocquel’s 
attention on her situation. Her 
confession that she could not pro- 
tect herself was abruptly enor- 
mously significant. It placed con- 
trol back in Jana hands. Janae 
could accept or reject a gift of 
knowledge from the reservoir on 
a self-determined basis. 

We can use what they have 
but we don't have to. 

Rocquel felt somehow stronger 
in his Jana identity as he had 
that awareness. The accusations 
leveled at Miliss by Jaer had had a 
certain truth to them. The entire 
populace felt a displacement as 
a consequence of the human 
presence, gentle as it was. 

After a little he was able to 
reason out the extent of her pre- 
dicament. He was appalled. Her 
position was very severe if she 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



and Dav could not really protect 
themselves. 

With an effort he pushed aside 
his anxiety for her, grew calm 
and grave. 

“There will be a difficult time 
ahead, my dear,” he said gently. 
“The new law binds me as much 
as it does everyone else. I cannot 
arbitrarily set you free. Have you 
an attorney?” 

"Not yet,” Miliss answered. 

“I’ll call Dav and tell him that 
it is imperative he get one for 
you.” 

“He won’t do a thing.” She 
reminded him of the death-drive 
situation— how only those surviv- 
ed who refused to help. She 
finished; “I counted on that to 
keep him away from me. So there 
can be no help from him.” 

Rocquel shook his head, 
smiling, and pointed out that his 
position in the matter was 
stronger than Dav’s. 

“I’ll call him,” he said firmly. 
"He’ll do it because I ask him, 
not necessarily to help you.” He 
broke off. “He’s the one who 
should act in this matter. It will 
look odd if he doesn't. So he 
will.” 

At that moment Rocquel acci- 
dentally caught a glimpse of his 
watch. It registered nearly four 
in the morning. He was instantly 
contrite. 

“I'm sorry,” he apologized. 
“I’ve kept you awake.” 

Miliss brushed his words aside. 

"I feel so much better. You've 
given me the first information 
from — out there — •” she gazed 
upward, waved vaguely — "that 

33 



I’ve had in all the years Dav and 
I have been here. It’s not 
clear — it’s hard to decide what 
it means. But now I know that 
there are still a few other human 
beings.” 

On that note they separated. 
Rocquel returned to the palace 
and presently slipped into bed 
beside the sleeping Nerda. 

She was a problem to which 
he had no quick solution either. 

VI 

T HE Jana attorney whom Dav 
consulted shook his head grave- 
ly over the fourth count. 

“The other accusations,” he 
said, “have as yet no legal penal- 
ties. The judge could do anything, 
could even release her. But crim- 
inal intent has proved dangerous 
in the past. It can bring a capital 
verdict.” 

Dav attended the trial as a 
witness, getting angrier every 
minute as all his “gifts” to the 
Janae were used as evidence 
against Miliss. The argument of 
the State was that a superior 
culture was. by way of its scien- 
tific gifts, cunningly guiding the 
Janae away from their natural 
development and into a mental 
enslavement that was the 
equivalent of a takeover of one 
people by another. Dav’s concern 
was with the accusations, not with 
Miliss. 

Called to the stand by Miliss’ 
attorney, he denied all such intent. 

“Science is neutral,” he said. 
“It is the truth of nature. Jana 
scientists would normally and in 
due course have discovered ex- 



actly tne same truths. In giving 
the Janae the sc^ntific artifacts 
of Earth’s ancient civilization I 
fulfilled a duty imposed upon me 
by a vanished race to hand on 
the torch of knowledge as rapidly 
as feasible in the hope that, with 
such a head start, the Janae would 
succeed in establishing a per- 
manently growing civilization in- 
stead of one that would eventually 
dwindle as others, including 
man’s, have been them — ” 

When he later came out on 
the street a troop of guards sent 
by Rocquel saved him from a 
demonstrating crowd. 

KEEP YOUR FOREIGN SCIENCE 
. .JANA MUST BE FREED FROM 
THE ALIEN YOKE. .JANA FOR THE 
JANAE. .DEATH TO THE INVADERS 
. .HUMANS, GO HOME 

The crowds screamed insults as 
Dav was escorted to a bus that 
took him, accompanied by several 
guards, to the end of the line. 
From there the soldiers walked 
with him to his house, where other 
soldiers patrolled the approaches, 
back, front and sides. 

Miliss was found guilty on all 
counts and sentenced to death. 
Three appeals to ever higher 
courts failed. But Rocquel granted 
her a full pardon on the grounds 
that The Chosen had not legis- 
lated on the matters at issue. 

“Prime minister” Jaer Dar- 
rish — and where had the title 
come fro m? — thereupon in- 
troduced amendments to criminal 
law. They were duly passed by 
The Chosen. Rocquel, to Jaer’s 
surprise, did not veto the legisla- 
tion. 



34 



GALAXY 



He asked Rocquel about it. The 
hereditary ruler gestured. 

“I told you I wouldn’t in- 
terfere.” He paused, curious. 
“Suppose all those charges you’re 
making turn out to be true. If 
man is really a superior race, then 
presumably a fleet of total power 
will come to the rescue of his 
representatives on Jana — and we 
will all be degraded by having 
to submit, however briefly, to an 
occupation force. What would you 
gain if that were to happen?” 

Jaer scowled. 

“Jana honor,” he said with the 
traditional arrogance of the Jana 
male, “demands that the truth 
of this matter be brought out into 
the open. We shall deal with this 
so-called total power when we see 
it.” 

“With what weapons?” Rocquel 
asked derisively. 

Jaer said, “The human man is 
being watched night and day. At 
the proper moment we’ll make 
a raid and we’ll capture all man’s 
scientific secrets and make an end 
of this degrading dole system on 
which he seems to have been 
operating — one secret at a time. 
Such doling is an unbearable 
insult. We want to have every- 
thing — now!” 

Rocquel stared sardonically at 
the other’s flushed face. 

Finally he said skeptically, 
“Your concern with such minor 
matters does not fit with your 
previous character, Jaer. I wonder 
what you’re really up to.” 

The. big male stiffened. “Do 
you question my loyalty, sire?” 

It could have been a dangerous 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



moment. But Rocquel merely 
shook his head chidingly. 

“No, Jaer, I expect you will 
accept the new law. It is to your 
advantage. What is your next 
move?” 

“You'll see.” 

Jaer turned abruptly and walk- 
ed away. 

L ATER Rocquel sought out Ner- 
da, reported Jaer’s statements 
and asked her opinion. 

She answered at once — no 
longer a surprise to him. Ever 
since her rebellion on the matter 
of going to sleep without his per- 
mission — which she now did as 
a matter of course — she had been 
freer in her responses in every 
way, even in their personal rela- 
tions. 

She told him that in her opinion 
Jaer wanted the human woman 
and that therefore his real target 
in the trial was not Miliss but 
Dav. 

Rocquel stared at his wife. 

“But — ” he began and stopped. 
Careful, he thought. Don’t 
give her another reason for losing 
respect for you. No knowing what 
repercussions that would have. 

But he felt slightly helpless 

before her statement. What she 
suggested was an immensely tricky 
thing for Jaer to be doing. 

Presumably the head of the Dor- 
rish clan expected that Miliss 

would be freed. 

Rocquel’s thought paused, a 
light dawning. Of course, in the 
trial of Miliss all the weaknesses 
of the prosecution’s case— and the 
strength of the defense — would be 

35 



revealed whereupon all the various 
loopholes in the law would be 
rectified — at which time Dav 
would be tried and irrevocably 
convicted. 

Rocquel stepped forward im- 
pulsively, and embraced Nerda. 

You're very brilliant,” he said. 
“There’s no question — I’ve got a 
very unusual and perceptive 
queen. Thank you.” 

He kissed her and was aware 
for the barest instant that she 
kissed him back. The action must 
have been involuntary. She broke 
the kiss and became passive. 

Rocquel was not offended. In 
the back of his mind was the 
thought that Jana females were, 
perhaps, not as unemotional as 
was believed. 

It might be worthwhile some 
day to conduct a deeper experi- 
ment. 

Meanwhile — he had to warn 
Dav. 

The next morning Rocquel 
learned that Miliss, who had been 
returned to custody on the formal 
charge of being a danger to the 
realm, was to be retried. Her at- 
torney’s plea at the preliminary 
hearing that afternoon was double 
jeopardy and the inapplicability 
of retroactive legislation. 

The judge released her. 

The prosecution requested and 
got a warrant for the arrest of 
Dav. 

The evening paper reported that 
the arresting officers had failed 
to find the Earth man. 

D AV spent the late afternoon in 
one of the hiding places of the 

36 



Reservoir of Symbols, planning 
his escape. 

It was time for the kind of 
disappearance that Miliss and he 
in times past had occasionally had 
to undertake. There had been 
other Janae like Jaer Dorrish. 
They, too, had had their own 
remorseless purposes. Escape in 
those distant times had almost al- 
ways consisted of their waiting 
somewhere for the particular 
enemy to live out his short life 
span. 

Dav left his hiding place after 
dark and made his way through 
the brush. His destination was a 
certain hillside where, nearly sev- 
enty years ago. he had buried 
a small spaceship. 

In years gone by, such long 
buried machinery had not always 
been readily located when 
needed — but this one had survived 
its seven decades totally free of 
unpleasant accidents. No 
bulldozer had nosed near it. No 
one had perched a building on 
top of it. The craft waited for 
him in its temporary grave. 

Dav was carefully clearing 
away a particularly dense clump 
of tall shrubs when he heard a 
sound. Noiselessly he sank to the 
ground. 

Too late. He heard a swift pad 
of footsteps in the dark. Two pairs 
of eyes glowed at him from beside 
some brush. Then strong, lean 
fingers had him pinned down. 

The unmistakable long nose of 
a Jana male was silhouetted 
against the haze of city lights. 
A Jana female stood beyond him. 

The deep voice of the male 

GALAXY 



s:i id exultantly, “Got you. Perna, 
quick, come over here and turn 
a light on this spying rascal — 
The words halted on a curse. “By 
Dilit, it isn't that scoundrel 
suitor of yours after all. Perna, 
bring that light, and let’s see what 
we’ve got here.” 

There was silence except for 
the unhurrying footsteps of the 
female. 

Dav lay unresisting, l ie could 
have taken steps. Pic could 
have reached up and, with the 
enormous strength that lie could 
focus into any part of his body, 
with unerring fingers stabbed at 
the two vital nerve centers in the 
Jana to send the big male 
sprawling in agony. Or he could 
simply have contemptuously and 
effortlessly disengaged himself by 
a direct muscular thrust. 

He did neither. As in past 
times, he was prepared to act de- 
fensively according to the need. 

A blaze of light cut off his 
thought. The light beat pitilessly 
down on his upturned face. And 
then, the female’s voice came, 
thick with disgust. 

, “Why, it’s the man. So this 
is the kind of lover you protect 
me from. Bah!” 

“Not so fast with your 
criticism,” growled the male. 
“There’s a reward. We can get 
married.” His grip tightened on 
Dav. “Get up, you antique. It’s 
time you and that woman ceased 
hanging on to life. Your kind is 
dead.” 

The moment for action had ar- 
rived but Dav did nothing. He 
offered no resistance as lie was 

HUMANS. GO HOME! 



jerked roughly to his feet. 

In those moments, an astound- 
ing thing had happened. 

He did not care. 

His thought was: Man’s 

civilization is dead — why should 
Miliss and / be bound by the 
values oj a society that has failed? 

The barriers he had erected 
against Miliss collapsed and a 
great guilt overwhelmed him. 
Suddenly he saw how rigid he 
had been as the dedicated savior 
of a new race. 

In that prolonged moment of 
anguish something she had once 
said flashed in his memory. 

I'm sure even your nose is get- 
ting a little longer. Pretty soon 
you'll even look like the Janae — ” 

He had lived in a dream, he 
saw now, a kind of self-induced 
hypnotism — an ideal which had 
given a temporary significance to 
an otherwise meaningless ex- 
istence. 

With Miliss doomed, nothing 
here was worth saving. 

He went wordlessly with his 
captor. 

T HE news came to Rocquel in 
the small hours of the morning 
that Dav had been arrested. He 
left his bed, dressed, phoned 
Miliss. 

“Have you had a visitor yet?” 
“No. But 1 imagine he’ll be 
here soon.” 

Rocquel said, “I’m coming 
right over.” 

He arrived by way of the secret 
entrance, and walked along a nar- 
row, dim-lit corridor until he came 
to a closed door. 



37 



Voices sounded from beyond 
it. 

Rocquel drew the door toward 
■ .ini and stepped through. He 
found himself in an alcove lighted 
by reflections from a bright room 
beyond a green and gold screen. 
The voices came from the other 
side of the screen. He recognized 
the calm bass of Jaer Dorrish 
and Miliss’ indignant soprano. 

“I’m surprised,” Miliss was 
saying, “that you continue to 
pursue me despite the fact that 
you are probably personally pro- 
grammed and may be in grave 
danger.” 

Jaer answered her with com- 
plete assurance, “l once allowed 
myself to be alarmed by such 
words. That will not happen 
again.” 

“What you’re saying,” said 
Miliss sharply, “is that you’ve 
abandoned reason.” 

“The Jana male,” was the cool 
reply, “knows what is important. 
A female is. Motivations for fear 
arc not." He chuckled lazily. “Let 
me reason out this situation for 
you. If you resist me you may 
lx- arrested again. But I may 
not even press charges against 
Dav if you give in. Who knows 
what privileges may continue for 
you two if you and I occasionally 
meet privately during the many, 
otherwise dull years ahead.” 

Rocquel stood there behind the 
screen and shook his head. Ner- 
da's intuition was correct. This 
entire action against the human 
beings was simply a typical Jana 
male scheme in connection with 
a female. 



He was not shocked. Or sur- 
prised, really. 

Jaer said, “It is late, my dear. 
Surely you do not expect any 
other visitors this evening.” 

The remark made it the ideal 
moment for Rocquel to come 
out of his hiding place. 

(i \kl ^ ^ * * said to him,” he told 
fT Nerda after he returned to 
the palace, “was, ‘Jaer, if I'm 
going to surrender some of the 
prerogatives of the crown — it is 
because I believe you and others 
of the nobility, in exchange for 
greater political power, will give 
up the purely personal privileges 
of forcing individuals to yield to 
a lordly whim.’ ” 

“And what did he answer?” 
“Nothing. He turned and walk- 
ed out of the room and out of 
the house.” 

Nerda made a distasteful 
gesture. 

“If he can get rid of Dav, he’ll 
count on eventually forcing Miliss 
to accept his protection.” 

“Then you think he will press 
charges against Dav?” 

“Your words didn't reach him. 
He’s still an old-style Jana male.” 
She shrugged. “So, of course.” 

D AV sat apathetic throughout 
his trial. The defense attorney 
appointed by Rocquel could not 
even persuade him to testify on 
his own behalf. 

He was convicted of being an 
alien spy and sentenced to be 
beheaded. 



38 



GALAXY 



VII 



B Y THE time Rocquel’s heli- 
copter settled down on the big 
compound where the executions 
would take place the male nobility 
was milling around inside, cat- 
calling and gambling. The wagers 
usually consisted of someone’s 
maintaining that he would win the 
chance to chop off the head of 
a convicted person. 

Rocquel walked through the 
crowd of would-be executioners, 
hearing grumbling about the in- 
creasing shortage of criminal 
heads. He came to the roped-off 
area where the victims were 
guarded and saw what the prob- 
lem was. Fewer than a hundred 
males, including Dav — and four 
females — were herded together at 
one end of an area that in the 
past had often held as many as 
five hundred. 

Roughly one hundred heads 
were to be divided among nearly 
eighteen hundred eager young no- 
bles. 

Roquel was handed the list of 
the doomed. Silently he scanned 
down it, looking for identifying 
comments. His attention caught 
two names. Their owners were 
classified as engineers. He scowled 
and turned to Jacr. 

“What are valuable men like 
that doing on this list?” 

Jacr held up a hand in a de- 
manding way. 

“Your majesty,” he said in a 
formal tone. “I must call to your 
attention that you are violating 
the procedure of the new law. 
The king can no longer deal 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



directly with individual cases. As 
your prime minister, I will consult 
you or listen to your advice and, 
in some instances but not all, will 
recommend that you grant mercy. 
Please give me that list.” 

With a sinking sensation Roc- 
quel handed it over. He had been 
intent on trying to save Dav and 
had automatically, as in times 
past, taken charge. He grew aware 
that the big male Jana was smiling 
satirically. 

“As for your question, sire,” 
Jaer said blandly, “the new law 
specifies that all persons are sub- 
ject to due process and to similar 
penalties.” He shrugged. “They 
killed. They were tried. The sen- 
tence was automatic.” 

“I sec,” said Rocquel. 

What lie saw most of all was 
that the noisy crowd would be 
against Dav and that lie had no 
solution to his problem of how to 
save the human. 

Jacr was speaking again. 

"Would you like to have me 
single these males out for ques- 
tioning, sire?” 

The Jana prime minister’s tone 
was tantalizing. He clearly felt 
himself in total ascendancy in this 
situation and was prepared to play 
hard at the game of constitutional 
monarchy. It seemed so obviously 
in his favor. 

Rocquel nodded yes to the 
question. While the two doomed 
males were being located he con- 
sciously forced himself to remem- 
ber his old way of dealing with 
one thing at a time. Presently he 

3 ? 



was able to put the fate of the 
human being out of the forefront 
of his mind and concentrate his 
attention on the here and now. 

T HE scene that he was thus able 
to focus on was almost literally 
right out of old Jana. He saw 
everywhere the swishing silks of 
die nobles, a glinting ocean of 
changing colors. Each male’s head 
was an elongated red shape that 
was visible at about the same 
height above the almost solid wall 
of silk. Eighteen hundred such 
heads made a picture of — oddly 
enough — innocent beauty. 

But it was the beauty of a 
beast of prey, proud, arrogant, 
strong, untamed. It was as if a 
natural state of being were on 
display. The primitive impulses 
that still moved these males from 
violence to violence in a never- 
ending madness were the product 
of equally primitive necessi- 
ties — their truth unquestioned on 
Jana until Dav and Miliss had 
begun to force self-control on an 
hierarchy that lived by the bloody 
law of supermasculinity. 

/ am looking, thought Rocquel, 
on the end of an era. Here, in 
these eighteen hundred . is embod- 
ied the last of the really feudal 
thing. 

It had to go, of course. But 
how? 

His thought ended as the two 
scientists were brought before 
Jaer. The Dorrish male glanced 
questioningly at Rocquel. who 
stepped forward. A moment later 
he was confronting their reality. 
Professional scientists and all 

40 



technical personnel had received 
special treatment from the courts 
for many years. They were not 
let off totally free, as a noble 
might be, but were given a prefer- 
red status. A person with an ad- 
vanced degree was proclaimed to 
be the equal of twenty ordinary 
persons. Possession of a second- 
ary degree made him the 
equivalent of fifteen persons. And 
the lowest degree, ten. Techni- 
cians started at two and went up 
to nine. 

Thus a twenty-person engineer 
who killed a wholly non- 
professional individual suffered 
what was only a one-twentieth 
penalty — usually a fine. Only if 
he killed another scientist of a 
twenty-person status was he in 
serious danger of being executed. 
That was murder by law. 

Jaer was speaking. 

“Here they arc, sire. 1 don’t 
really sec that we can do anything 
for them under the new regula- 
tions.” 

Rocquel had the same thought. 
But lie said nothing as Jaer turned 
away and ordered the males to 
be brought closer. The two engi- 
neers came forward and were 
identified as. respectively, a fifteen 
and ten. The former had killed 
in a fit of rage which — when his 
gag was removed— he earnestly 
protested had been a proper reac- 
tion to an insolent three. And 
the ten had killed a unit person 
in a fit of typical Jana male tem- 
per for no particular reason. 

No occasion existed for 
favoritism. The new law must 
convince by its impartiality. The 

GALAXY 




HUMANS, GO HOME! 



41 





two were simply unlucky that they 
were the first examples of their 
class. 

Rocquel nodded. Jaer had the 
gags replaced and then read in 
a loud, clear voice the confirma- 
tion of the sentences. 

Moments later the lottery 
machine drew the names of the 
executioners. And, to the sound 
of much cursing on the part of 
those who had lost, the grinning 
winners came forward, simul- 
taneously raised their swords and 
simultaneously struck at the heads 
on the blocks. 

And missed. 

A roar of amazement came 
from the gallery of noble Janae. 

R OCQUEL was fighting a pecul- 
iar confusion. Something — some 
energy — had snatched at one side 
of his body, pulled at one arm, 
spun him slightly. At that moment 
the yelling started and he realized 
that something was wrong. 

He whirled. 

The two nobles had recovered. 
Muttering words of outrage, they 
raised their swords for a second 
blow. 

“Wait!” Rocquel roared. 

The swords wavered, were 
sullenly grounded. Two angry, 
embarrassed nobles glared at their 
hereditary king questioningly. 

“What happened?” Rocquel 
demanded. 

Both told the same story. 
Something like a wind had 
snatched at their swords. Or it 
was as if they had struck at a 
blast of air so strong it had 
diverted their slashing blows. 

42 



Catcalls were beginning among 
the onlookers. Rocquel glanced 
unhappily at the prison compound 
and saw that Dav had come to 
the gate. 

Rocquel spoke to Jaer. 

“Let nothing happen till 1 
return.” 

The Dorrish leader gave him 
a startled look but said nothing 
as Rocquel walked over to where 
Dav stood. 

The human greeted him with: 
“What happened?” 

“That’s what 1 was going to 
ask you.” 

He explained what the nobles 
had said. 

“Sounds like a symbol,” Dav 
admitted, frowning. “But 1 know 
of none that is applicable in a 
situation such as this. Due process 
has occurred. There’s nothing 
better on Jana right now. Why 
don’t you have Jaer continue with 
the executions? Maybe it was an 
accident.” 

Rocquel, who was remembering 
the grabbing sensation that had 
affected his right side moments 
before and also on the morning 
of his return to Jana, silently 
doubted it. But he walked back 
to the executioners’ blocks and 
ordered the two engineers releas- 
ed. That was the tradition. 

“You forfeit your wagers,” he 
curtly told the would-be execu- 
tioners. 

The two males walked off, 
cursing. 

The order of procedure now 
required that the females be kill- 
ed. One of the four was a poor 
little old thing who was quite 

GALAXY 



insane. She believed the crowd 
was present to fete her. It did 
not even occur to Rocquel to do 
anything for her. Jana had no 
place for insane people. They 
were invariably put to death if 
they became a burden — and a 
burden she was. 

As Rocquel turned to consider 
the other females, he found his 
way barred by Jaer. The big male 
was shaking his head. 

“Sire,” he said, “you have been 
taking command again.” 

The truth was obvious. Rocquel 
shook his head. 

He said with a twisted smile, 
“Giving up power seems to be 
quite a difficult process. So bear 
with me, Lord Jaer. I mean well.” 

No answering smile moved that 
grim countenance. 

Rocquel thought, what a 
remarkable man the ancient king 
on earth must have been who 
first agreed — when there were no 
precedents — to limit his absolute 
rights under a constitutional 
monarchy. 

At the moment he could not 
remember the name of that king, 
though Dav had told him. 

What brought the historic prec- 
edent to mind was that, even 
now, Rocquel found it hard to 
adjust to the idea that what he 
gave up Jaer would gain. But 
finally Rocquel relaxed. 

He stepped back. 

“Continue, Lord of the Dor- 
rish.” 

He was able then to observe 
the scene once more without in- 
terference from his troubled inner 
self. 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



Of the other three females, two 
were beyond anyone’s power to 
help. They had been accused of 
adultery by their noble husbands 
and had been convicted. Rocquel 
privately doubted that the un- 
natural crime had occurred but 
this was not the time to take 
issue with a court’s findings. 

The remaining woman had de- 
nied the truth of religion. As she 
was brought before them, Jaer 
glanced questioningly at Rocquel. 
He evidently expected no in- 
terference, intended the glance to 
be a matter of form only. 

He was turning away when 
Rocquel caught his arm. 

The Dorrish leader faced about 
with a tolerant expression. It be- 
came quite evident, as he listened 
to Rocquel, that on these minor 
matters he was prepared to allow 
the king the prerogative of grant- 
ing mercy. 

He finally said, “Sire, why don’t 
I say that in this instance a 
reprieve will be granted and then 
you state the reasons.” 

That was the way it was done. 

Rocquel spoke briefly to the 
assembled nobles, stressing the 
need — as Dav had urged upon 
him long ago — to keep religion 
humanitarian. 

He spared her life. 

H E STOOD by then, tense, not 
knowing what to expect as the 
three overjoyed winners came 
forward. The two w'ho were 
assigned the adulterous females 
uttered expressions of pleasure at 
having the privilege of performing 
so necessary a task. 



43 



All three swords whipped high 
and came down as one. 

The females had been kneeling 
fatalistically. They looked up after 
a little as if to ask what was 
wrong. 

What was wrong was that the 
swords were lying a dozen feet 
away — Rocquel, who had watched 
closely, thought he had seen the 
glint of too much metal as the 
weapons had flown through the 
air. But he could not be sure. 
Something strong had grabbed at 
him as with fingers of steel and 
had moved him inches at the mo- 
ment of attempted execution. 

He saw that Jaer was lying on 
the ground nearby. Rocquel 
helped the big male to his feet. 

“What happened?” 

“This is magic,” Jaer muttered. 
“Something hit me a terrific 
blow.” 

He seemed uncertain and of- 
fered no objection to Rocquel 's 
suggestion that the executions 
should be temporarily halted 
pending an investigation. 

“But what kind of investiga- 
tion?” he asked in a bewildered 
tone. 

Rocquel assured him that there 
was at least one person to ques- 
tion. 

And so, after the women had 
been released and the second 
group of executioners dismissed, 
Rocquel had Dav brought out of 
the compound. 

“You saw' that?” he asked ac- 
cusingly. 

“Yes. There’s no doubt. It’s a 
symbol and the second time it 
w'as more violent. The pow'er 

44 



behind it is increasing very 
rapidly.” 

“But what symbol can it be?” 
Rocquel protested. “I thought 
symbols were — ” He stopped, re- 
membering that he had no idea 
what symbols were. He finished 
lamely: “What do you suggest?” 
Dav said, “The next time there 
may be feedbacks and the execu- 
tioners may get hurt.” He seemed 
interested. Some of the apathy he 
had displayed earlier seemed to 
be lifting. His eyes were suddenly 
bright. He looked around 
hopefully. “Why don’t you let Jaer 
try to execute me? That would 
solve a lot of problems.” 

Rocquel frowned. He shook his 
head. Injury to— or the death 
of — the head of the Dorrish clan 
would merely create confusion in 
an important segment of the Jana 
populace. 

T HE catcalls were beginning 
again, demanding decisions. But 
the nobles sounded puzzled. The 
tone of the raised voices showed 
that the vocalizers were not clear 
as to what was going on. And only 
a percentage was actually yelling. 
It struck Rocquel that to the 
aristocratic onlookers the events 
at the focal point of the execu- 
tions had probably been obscure. 

Besides, no one had ever been 
able to explain anything, really, 
to Jana nobles as a group. 

The fact that no help could 
be expected from the nobility 
made the situation even more dif- 
ficult. Rocquel stood distracted, 
not knowing W'hat to do. The 
yelling grew louder, more insist- 

GALAXY 



ent. Abruptly Rocquel realized 
why. By bringing Dav out ot' the 
compound he had given the im- 
pression that the human was next 
in line for execution. 

And Dav’s life was what those 
who cried out were demanding. 

Dav was pale but yelled above 
the bedlam almost directly into 
Rocquel’s ear, “Why not make 
the attempt? Let’s see what hap- 
pens.” 

Rocquel tried to answer back, 
tried to say, What's going on? 
What’s happening? Is the symbol 
I believed l had control of acting 
independently of my command — 
or any command at all? 

He couldn’t say it. The words 
wouldn't come. His face contorted 
with his effort to speak. 

Dav asked, “What’s the matter, 
sire?” 

Rocquel tried again to speak, 
could not. A degrading awareness 
overwhelmed him. 

I’m programmed. I could tell 
Miliss about the symbol / con- 
trolled but I can’t tell Dav. 

Not — the realization suddenly 
was strong— that he had ever 
really controlled it. It had been 
attached to him somehow — but in 
the manner of a symbol it had 
reacted in this situation because 
this was what it related to. 

“I feel,” said Rocquel — and 
now the words came easily — “that 
these executions are not being 
allowed.” 

So he could speak if he made 
no direct reference to his symbol. 

Dav was shaking his head. 

“I don’t understand it. The time 
is not yet on Jana for the end 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



of capital punishment. In fact — ” 
He sounded appalled. He waved 
vaguely, his gesture taking in the 
horizon. “If a few million of those 
paranoid males out there ever get 
the idea that they cannot be ex- 
ecuted all hell will break loose.” 

The picture of total 
disaster— of pillage, rape, and 
mayhem — evoked by the man’s 
words, sent a chill through Roc- 
quel. He visualized vast armies 
of criminals rioting in the streets, 
swarming in gangs through the 
country. Something had to be 
done at once. 

Belatedly again he remembered 
that the Dorrish leader was in 
charge here and should be con- 
sulted. He swung about and be- 
came aware that the big male was 
standing off to one side, watching 
Dav from narrowed eyes. 

Rocquel had time for only a 
glance — the seconds were flying 
by and the noise from the gallery 
was rising to such a crescendo 
that further conversation was im- 
possible. Rocquel signaled the 
royal drummers to beat for 
silence. 

Moments later he explained to 
a startled audience what Dav had 
said about a symbol’s being in- 
volved. 

When he had finished a loud 
voice cried from somewhere in 
the crowd. “If we mob that so- 
and-so it’ll end the nonsense.” 

Whoever spoke must have tried 
to push forward. A movement 
started. A dozen, then dozens, 
then hundreds surged forward. 

A voice yelled in Rocquel’s ear, 
“Run for your life — ” 



45 



The tone was so urgent that 
Rocquel was a score of feet 
toward safety before he realized 
that it was Dav who had yelled 
at him. He stopped and 
turned — and was barely in time 
to see the disaster. 

VIII 

M ALE bodies were being spun 
as if in a whirlpool. A fountain 
was already up in the air, being 
held and twisted by an invisible 
force. 

From the corner of one eye 
he saw Dav frantically pushing 
through the retreating crowd 
toward him. The human broke 
through abruptly. 

“Quick!” he yelled. “If they’re 
whirled any higher, they may be 
hurt or killed when they fall.” 
Rocquel said blankly. “What do 
you mean — quick? Quick what?” 
Dav’s eyes, so bright for a mo- 
ment, misted. A puzzled look 
came to his face. 

He muttered, “What’s the mat- 
ter with me? I don’t know why 
I said that.” 

But the real message of his 
reaction had penetrated. Rocquel 
was thinking. He's programed, 
also. 

He felt the truth grow in him. 
It bothered him. Bothered him 
a lot. But the truth was that he 
was unquestionably watching the 
symbol over which he had been 
given control. 

What was reassuring was the 
fact that in this decisive hour the 
ultimate decision had been left 
to the hereditary general of 
Jana- — himself. 

46 



As he hastily evoked within his 
mind the mental pattern that 
would bring the Tizane energy to 
bear on the symbol. Rocquel 
thought. It really doesn't take very 
much direct interference with in- 
dividuals to control a planet with 
symbols. Only a few key 
persons. 

In the entire sequence of events 
the most unique facet was that 
both of the mentors — Dav and 
Miliss — had also not been allowed 
free will. 

A FTER the whirlpool of noble 
males of Jana began to drop to 
the ground— where some lay for 
a long time — Rocquel suggested 
to Jaer that the executions con- 
tinue. 

The big male stared at him 
blankly. 

“Your majesty,” he said finally 
in amazement. “I doubt we could 
find a single person at this mo- 
ment willing to act the role of 
executioner.” 

Rocquel was convinced of it. 
He worded his reply blandly. The 
decision to suspend executions 
must be made by the government 
and not by the constitutional 
monarch. 

He added, watching Jaer 
closely: “I have a feeling that 
the government should also grant 
a pardon to Dav.” 

Those words got him, first, a 
dark, darting look. Slowly a 
crooked smile stretched across 
that normally grim face. 

“Your majesty,” said Jaer 
Dorrish, “let me refer to an earlier 
remark of yours. I have realized 

GALAXY 



today that you do mean well and 
that it is hard to give up power. 
Apparently it is almost as hard 
for a person like myself to accept 
an accretion of power 
gracefully — but I should like to 
assure you that it is my intention 
to try. I see the role of prime 
minister as one that will involve 
a great deal of integrity. So — ” 
He made a gesture with one hand, 
said in a formal tone, “To prove 
to you that I have the intent of 
living up to that level of integrity, 
I hereby request in my capacity 
as leader of the government until 
the first election under the new 
law that you grant a reprieve 
and full pardon to Dav, the hu- 
man.” 

“I grant it,” said Rocquel. 

It was a great victory — yet he 
experienced a sudden drop in 
spirits on the way home. He rode 
nearly a hundred yards with his 
motorcycle guard before he realiz- 
ed that he was having a more 
severe recurrence of an earlier 
feeling. 

I'm programed and that de- 
grades me. 

Back in the palace, he told 
Nerda his feeling. All the rest 
of that afternoon and part of the 
evening, she argued with him. 

Programing, she pointed out, 
was like a drop of chemical which 
might give to a flowing stream 
a slightly bluish tinge. Nothing 
but a dam could stop or divert 
the stream — yet after the injection 
of the chemical it was colored 
in a specific way. 

Her analogy triggered a thought 
in Rocquel. His programing had 

HUMANS. GO HOME! 



taken the form of accelerated 
civilizing of a paranoid 
male — himself. He was still 
hereditary general, still married to 
Nerda, with no intention of giving 
up either the position or the wife. 
Yet he had tolerated a change 
in the form by which he exercised 
his power, and he had accepted 
less total control over his wife. 

And in neither instance did he 
feel a real loss. 

Nerda suggested to him that 
the long-term programing of 
Miliss and Dav had been designed 
to make it possible for them to 
accept the unendurable existence 
of a lovely human couple 
marooned on an alien planet. And 
because the stream of life flowed 
immortally through them, they 
were separately programed as 
a man and a woman to survive 
periodic crises. So the great 
civilization out there controlled 
even its own emissaries. 

In this generation, Nerda con- 
tinued, perhaps only she and 
Rocquel would know the truth 
and, to a lesser extent, Jaer. The 
hereditary general and his wife, 
and the hereditary leader of the 
principal subordinate group, the 
Dorrish. But their own personali- 
ties remained overwhelmingly 
private. The stream of Jana iden- 
tity flowed on in them — but it 
was now a more civilized being 
that felt the flow. 

She must have realized from 
the accepting expression of his 
face and body that she could 
finally change the subject. 

“Do you still have control of 
the symbol?” she asked. 



47 



It was night and they were 
standing at a huge window looking 
toward the slickrock mountains. 

Rocquel imaged the first three 
stages of the Tizane pattern. 
Something grazed his leg. He 
knew' a hackles-raising sensa- 
tion — a sense of an energy field 
of enormous power. 

Hastily he turned his thoughts 
aside. 

“Yes,” he said. “It’s still there.” 

“In your presence,” said Nerda, 
“no one can be killed — as long 
as you control that symbol. Did 
they say when they would take 
it away from you?” 

Rocquel was about to make the 
same reply he had given to 

Miliss — -when he realized that 
there was quite a different 

awareness in him. A barrier had 
lifted from his memory. He 

recalled exactly what he had been 
told. 

“No,” he said simply, “they just 
gave it to me. It's a lifetime gift.” 

He began to feel better. 

In my presence, no one can 
be killed. 

Suddenly he divined that his 
yvas a very advanced symbol in- 
deed. He stood at a nearly 

unthinkable height of understand- 
ing and power. 

Deep inside him something that 
was almost infinitely savage was 
mollified. Possessing what was 
surely one of the ultimate human 
symbols — he accepted his lesser 
than human status. 

F OR Dav it felt strange to be 
free. He walked slowly to a 
nearby restaurant and sat down 

-43 



at a table. He was eating almost 
mindlessly when he heard the ra- 
dio announce that he had been 
pardoned. The news struck him 
with an odd impact. The life force 
within him quickened. 

He grew aware that the Janae 
in the restaurant were staring at 
him curiously. No one showed 
hostility. 

He had no place that he wanted 
to go — so later he walked the 
streets. Finally he began to won- 
der. 

Am / trying to solve a prob- 
lem — and if so, what? 

He could not decide. 
Everything seemed very far away. 

He had a feeling that there was 
something he should be doing. Rut 
he did not know what. 

Night came. 

He waved a surface car to a 
halt. It drew up, its lights glit- 
tering, its bells clanging. No one 
said anything to him as he swung 
aboard. 

Some younger Janae climbed 
on at the next stop. They sat 
giggling at him. But they rushed 
off into a brilliantly lighted park 
where hundreds of youthful Janae 
were dancing to the rhythm of 
a low, fast-tempo, sobbing music. 

He continued his public ex- 
posure until almost midnight, 
without any untoward incidents. 
He returned to the white house 
by the river. As he entered the 
w'est w'ing he presumed Miliss was 
in her part of the residence. But 
he made no effort to contact her. 

He slept the special deep sleep 
which triggered long-ago pro- 
graming deep in his brain. Still 

GALAXY 



asleep, he went to a room that 
was deceptively equipped with 
what seemed to be ordinary Jana- 
level electronic equipment. But by 
pressing certain buttons and turn- 
ing certain dials in a specific se- 
quence Dav activated a com- 
munications system hidden in a 
remote part of the Jana planet. 

Subspace radio waves thereup- 
on transmitted a message to a 
receiver many light-years away. 

The message was: “The crisis 
of the last stage of kings has 
passed — ” 

The message completed au- 
tomatically, then repeated and re- 
peated. Finally a relay was closed 
on the receiving planet by an ac- 
cepting mind. 

A voice — or a thought— said. 
“Message received, recorded.” 

A light flashed on in an instru- 
ment in front of Dav and, still 
asleep, he returned to bed. 

M IIJSS had watched him first 
through scanners and then — as 
she realized his catatonic 
unawareness of his surround- 
ings — by following him closely. 

So that, as he turned away from 
the equipment, she stepped up to 
it and spoke to the distant listener. 
It was almost as if her com- 
munication were expected. 

The voice answered, “We have 
come to a time when the wom- 
an — you — must know something 
of the truth.” 

“What is the truth?” Miliss 
asked. She did not wait for the 
reply but rushed on: Was there 
a universal death or was the idea 

HUMANS, GO HOME! 



the result of early programing? 

“At the next crisis,” was the 
reply, “you will be allowed to 
visit— -and see for yourself. 
Meanwhile, the man — Dav — must 
not be told. In fact, you will 
discover if you try that you cannot 
tell him.” 

“Why not tell him?” 

It seemed that the reasons for 
that were deeply bound up in the 
godlike cravings of masculinity in 
the male and related idealistic 
motivations. 

“And that's all we are allowed 
to say,” concluded the faraway 
voice. 

When the connection had been 
broken Miliss — feeling suddenly 
much better, even light-hearted, 
as if she were again somebody 
and not a living artifact of a dead 
culture; feeling strangely tender 
toward that poor, programed 
superbeing, her husband — began 
the long task of moving back into 
the west wing. 

By morning she had most of 
her beautiful things in their proper 
locations. And so, when Dav 
awakened and turned over he saw 
a blond woman with a smile on 
her face — and a faint look of in- 
nocence as if everything she had 
done, including this return, had 
been totally rational. 

This vision said to him. “I hope 
you’ll be glad to know that you 
have a wife again.” 

On a planet where there is only 
one woman, and that woman 
beautiful, what could the only 
man say to that? 

Dav said he was glad. 

“Come over here," he said. ©

VENUSIANS 

by Donald H.Menze! 



This month's cover is timed 
to coincide with Mariner VI 
and VII flybys of Mars, 
intended to determine 
whether the Red Planet 
con support life. The artist. 

Dr. Donald H. Menzel, is 
Paine Professor of Practical 
Astronomy and Professor of 
Astrophysics, Harvard 
University; former Director, 
Harvard College Observatory; 
Research Scientist, Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory. 

Is there life on the 
Red Planet? 

Reed right 




S OME people have visions. Oth- 
ers hear voices. What the vi- 
sions or voices signify nobody 
knows. Messages from the past? 
Portents of the future? Glimpses 
of other worlds? I wouldn’t ven- 
ture an opinion. I myself seem 
to make frequent contact with 
worlds and eras beyond our Earth. 

I first became aware of this 
unusual ability about ten years 
ago, in March 1958, to be exact. 
1 was sitting in a meeting of the 
Faculty of Harvard University. I 
had brought with me a tablet to 
record memoranda of decisions, 
especially those affecting the 
Observatory or the Department of 
Astronomy. And this meeting, 
devoted mainly to problems of 
Parietal Rules — those decisions 
feeling the hours when Harvard 
students may entertain female 
companions in their rooms— was 
incredibly dull. 

At some moment during these 
boring deliberations 1 suddenly 
realized that my pencil, previously 



50 




engaged in aimless doodling, had 
now assumed control. Sweeping 
over the tablet, the pencil began 
to delineate mysterious beings, 
clearly not of earthly origin. They 
must have some planet to live 
on — and I eventually realized that 
most resided on Mars. But a 
few Venusians, Moon Beings and 
inhabitants of a planet revolving 
around Alpha Centauri revealed 
their existence also. Many of 
them, brightened with water col- 
ors, have become collectors’ 
items. And only the most 
insensitive of my colleagues, those 
with no sense of artistic appre- 
ciation, refer to my work as 
“Doodles from Menzel’s penzel.” 
More than a decade and some 
ten thousand spacemen later, 1 
present herewith a few represent- 
ative creatures from outer space. 

T HE cover illustration depicts a 
recurring theme, the Martian 
Cyclops, whose form does not in 
the least resemble that of the 



mythical one-eyed giant who held 
Ulysses captive. The Martian 
creature is not a monster with 
one eye. It is a monster eye that 
clearly lives for vision alone — for 
the mere joy of viewing the rug- 
ged. cratered desert of the red 
planet. The large wings permit 
rapid flight. 

The “holes” — which reveal the 
three-dimensional nature of the 
being — are characteristic of many 
space creatures. They function 
something like the gills of a fish, 
increasing contact with the en- 
vironment. 

The skating, dancing dinosaur 
lives in a checkered world, seeking 
satisfaction in the speed of Mar- 
tian living. The dinosaur’s skin 
is like smooth green leather, af- 
fording ample protection against 
the bitterly cold Martian winter 
nights. The polar caps of Mars, 
unlike those of planet Earth, are 
only a foot or two thick. But 
they nevertheless provide an ex- 
cellent rink for skaters. 



MARTIANS AND VENUSIANS

The progenitors of the female 
Martian dragon left the Moon 
millions of years ago as that body 
gradually lost its air and water 
into space. She finds the environ- 
ment of Mars particularly 
friendly. Many of the plants on 
Mars are peripatetic. I am cur- 
rently expecting a revelation con- 
cerning the nature of the offspring 
from this union. 

I he Venusian Beauty is a joy 
to behold. Her elaborate hair-do 
represents the traditional style of 
the females of that planet. Her 
outboard bust is entirely func- 
tional, the better to survive in 
the intense heat of the planet. 
Life, as recently noted by Pro- 
fessor Willard Libby, well-known 
Nobel Laureate, can exist only 
in the mild zone between the ice- 
capped poles and the broiling 
equatorial region. Note how the 
tail enhances her ethereal beauty. 

On Earth, we have long believ- 
ed that tailless man was higher 
in the evolutionary scale than the 
ape. We see how wrong we were 
in this supposition. Doubtless, as 
man ascends to greater heights 
he, too, will grow a tail. 

The Martian Sea Horse is a 
friendly creature despite the fact 
that he is frozen stiff most of 
the time. But when the warmth 
of the Martian day unlocks the 
ice on the fringes of the polar 
cap the Sea Horse rapidly cavorts 
through the seas, conversing with 
every creature he encounters. 



Here we sec him discussing Mar- 
tian politics with a friendly one- 
eyed Sea Slug, They have not yet 
decided for whom to vole. But 
every creature on Mars has the 
ballot. 

The Martian C loud represents 
a form unlike anything on Earth. 
We are accustomed to beings that 
are solid or liquid or a combina- 
tion of both. However, although 
gases do enter life’s processes in 
the form of oxygen or in varieties 
of waste products, we do not think 
of gases as living beings. 

Enormous clouds develop on 
Mars. They express intelligence 
and have powers of locomotion. 
Terrestrial astronomers have fre- 
quently seen fast-moving clouds 
on Mars but have been at a loss to 
explain them. The speeding spots 
are enormous living creatures. 

We complete this exhibit with 
two Martian birds. The Purple 
Bearded Night Owl, a denizen of 
the Martian night, flaps his wings 
in the thin, cold atmosphere 
and munches a meager meal of 
insects, while Phobos, the planet's 
nether moon, looks benignly on. 
The second bird, the Rainbow- 
Feathered Esophagus, welcomes 
the day with song. The rainbow 
lutes of the plumage make this 
creature a welcome sight on the 
bleak Marscape. 

Within a few decades, after 
Martian explorers return to Earth, 
we may see such creatures in our 
terrestrial zoos. •

the G'drellian, was 
phasing out of adolescence 
— and four billion humans 
were about to be phased out 
of existence! 



JOE HALDEMAN 

T RAPPED. From the waterfront 
bar to a crap game to a simple- 
minded ambush in a dead-end 
alley. 

He didn't blame them for being 
angry. His pockets were stuffed 
with their money, greasy and 
crumpled fives and tens. Two 
thousand and twenty of their 
hard-earned dollars, if his memory 
served him right. And of course 
it did. 



53 



They had supplied three sets 
of dice— two loaded, one shaved. 
All three were childishly easy to 
manipulate. He let them win every 
throw at first, then less and less 
often. Finally he tested their 
credulity and rapidly emptied their 
pockets with ten sevens in a row. 

That much had been easy. But 
now he was in a difficult position. 
Under the transparent pretext of 
finding a bigger game, the leader 
of the gang had steered him into 
this blind alley, where five others 
were hiding in ambush. 

And now the six were joined 
in a line, advancing on him, 
pushing him toward the tall hur- 
ricane fence that blocked the end 
of the alley. 

He started pacing them, walk- 
ing backward. Not that they could 
do any physical harm to him. But 
he needed time. Only thirty sec- 
onds, give or take a little, before 
he would back into the fence and 
be caught. 

Thirty seconds objective . 

He froze and did a little trick 
with his brain. All the energy his 
strange body produced, except for 
that fraction needed to maintain 
human form, was channeled into 
heightening his sensory percep- 
tions, accelerating his mental pro- 
cesses. He had to find a way 
out of this dilemma without ex- 
posing his true nature. 

The murderous sextet seemed 
to slow down as the ratio of sub- 
jective to objective time flux in- 

54 



creased arithmetically, .geometri- 
cally, exponentially. 

A drop of sweat rolled from 
the leader’s brow, fell two feet 
in a fraction of a second, a foot 
in the next second, an inch in 
the next, a millimeter, a mi- 
cron . 

Now. 

A pity he couldn't just kill them 
all slowly and painfully. Terrible 
to have artistic responsibility sti- 
fled by practical considerations. 
Such a beautiful composition; a 
spectrum of attitudes ranging from 
the little one’s ill-concealed fear 
of pain, of inflicting pain, to the 
leader’s leering, sadistic anticipa- 
tion of pleasure in the kill — the 
dilettante! 

A smallish work, only six to 
play on. Still, he ought to practice 
on some little pieces before the 
great epic. But it might arouse 
suspicion. 

And Llarval said . 

That snail. Insensitive brute . 

Next ■ time out I’ll get me a 
supervisor who is able to un- 
derstand . 

But next time out, I’ll be too 
old . 

Even now / can feel it . 

Damn that snail! 

T HE ship hovered above a South 
American plantation. People 
looked at it and saw only the sky. 
Radar would never detect it. Only 
a voodoo priest in a mushroom 
trance felt its presence. He tried 

GALAXY 



lo verbalize and died of a cerebral 
occlusion. 

Too quick. Artless. Braxn was 
kind of ashamed of it. 

“Bluntly, I wish we didn't have 
to use you, Braxn.” 

Llarval was talking. 

His crude race communicated 
vocally and the unmodulated, in- 
and-out-of-phase thought waves 
washed a gravelly ebb and flow 
of pain through Braxn’s organ of 
communication. He stored the 
pain, low intensity that it was, 
for contemplation at a more 
satisfactory time. 

Llarval repeated: “If only we 
had brought someone else of your 
sort — besides your father, of 
course. Shape-changers aren’t 
such a rarity.” 

He plucked out a cilium in 
frustration but of course felt no 
pain. Braxn was too close, sucked 
it in. 

“A G’drellian poet. A poet of 
pain. Of all the useless baggage 
to drag around on a survey ex- 
pedition — ” Llarval sighed and 
ground his shell against the wall. 
‘‘But we have no choice. Only 
two bipeds aboard the ship and 
neither of them is even remotely 
mammalian. And the natives of 
this planet are acutely 
xenophobic. Hell, they're om- 
niphobic. Even harder to take 
than you, worthy poet. But this 
is the biggest find of the whole 
trip! The crucial period of transi- 
tion — they may be on the brink 

OUT OF PHASE 



of civilization, still animals but 
rapidly advancing. Think of it! 
In ten or twenty generations they 
may be human and seek us, as 
most do.” 

The shapeless blob that was 
Braxn was turning a bored shade 
of green. 

“We’ve met thousands of 
civilized races — more thousands 
of savage ones — but this is the 
first we’ve ever found in transi- 
tion, correct? Ethnology, alien 
psychology, everything — ” Llarval 
shuddered — “even your people's 
excuse for art, will benefit im- 
measurably.” 

Braxn had his doubts but he 
made no comment. He hadn't 
bothered to form a speech organ 
for the interview. He knew Llarval 
would do all the talking anyway. 

But Braxn had been studying, 
under stasis, for several hours. 
Knowing exactly what needed to 
be done, he let most of his body 
disintegrate into its component 
parts and started to rebuild. 

First the skeleton, bone by 
thousandth bone; the internal 
organs, in logical order, glistening, 
throbbing, functioning; wet-red 
muscle, fat, connective tissue, 
derma, epidermis smooth and 
olive, fingernails, hair, small mole 
on the left check. 

Vocal cords, virgin, throb con- 
tralto: “Mammalian enough?” 

“Speak Galactic.” 

“I said, ‘Mammalian enough?’ 
I mean, would you like them big- 



55 



ger — ” she demonstrated — “or 
smaller?” 

“How would I know?” snapped 
Llarval, trying to hide his disgust. 
“Pick some sort of statistical 
mean.” 

Braxn picked a statistical mean 
between the October and the No- 
vember Playmate of the Month. 

With what he thought was 
detached objectivity, Llarval said, 
“Ugly bunch of creatures, aren’t 
they?” 

About a hundred million years 
ago, Llarval’s prehistoric 
ancestors had known one natural 
enemy — a race of biped mam- 
ma's. 

With a silvery laugh Braxn left 
to prepare for planetfall. 

He got a kick, for the moment, 
out of being a “she.” 

B RAXN had studied Earth and 
its people for some ten thou- 
sand hours, subjective time. She 
knew about clothes. She knew 
about sex. She knew about rape. 

So she appeared on Earth — on 
a dirt road somewhere in South 
America— without a stitch and 
without a blush. And her 
scholastic observations were con- 
firmed in the field, so to speak, 
in less than five minutes. She 
learned quite a bit the first time, 
less the second. The third time, 
well, she was merely bored. 

She made him into a 
beautiful — poem? 



She made him into a mouse- 
sized, shriveled brown husk lying 
dead by the side of the road, 
his tiny features contorted with 
incredible agony. 

She synthesized clothes, gray 
and dirty, and changed herself into 
an old, crippled hag. It was twenty 
minutes before she met another 
man, who . 

Another dry husk. 

Braxn was getting an interest- 
ing, if low, opinion of men, Boliv- 
ian farmers in particular. So she 
changed herself into one. The 
shoe on the other foot, she found, 
made things different but not 
necessarily better. Well, she was 
gathering material. 

She waited for a car to come 
by, reverted to the original volup- 
tuous pattern, disposed of the 
driver when he stopped to 
investigate, took his form and his 
car and started on a world tour. 

B RAXN tried to do everything 
and be everyone. 

He was in turn a doctor, 
lawyer, fencing coach. Prostitute, 
auto racer, mountain climber, golf 
pro. He ran a pornography shop 
in Dallas, a hot-dog stand at Con- 
ey Island, a death-sleep house in 
Peking, a Viennese coffee house, 
the museum at Dachau. He ped- 
dled Bibles and amulets, Fuller 
brushes and heroin. He was a 
society deb, a Bohemian poet, a 
member of Parliament, a eul-de- 
jatte in Monaco.

GALAXY 



For operating expenses, when 
he needed small sums, he wove 
baskets, sold his body, dived for 
pennies, cast horoscopes. 

Threw dice. 



T HE sweat drop had moved a 
hundredth of an inch. 

Must stop wasting time hut it’s 
so hard to concentrate when it 
feels as if you had all the time in 
the universe . 

Braxn knew that he could re- 
main in this state only a few more 
minutes (subjective) before he 
was stuck in it permanently. On 
the ship he could spend as much 
time as he wanted in mental ac- 
celeration but here there was no 
apparatus to shock him out of 
it before trance set in. The trance 
would go on for more than a 
thousand years, such was his 
race's span of life. But to the 
six hoods he would age and die 
in a few seconds, reverting to his 
original form for an invisible 
nanosecond before dissolving into 
a small gray mound of dust. 

He was seeing in the far in- 
frared now and definition was 
very poor. He switched to field 
recognition. The dull animals 
confronting him had dim red 
psionic envelopes, almost com- 
pletely washed out by his own, 
a crackling, stroboscopic violet. 

Electromagnetic. The ion fog 
around the leader's watch glowed 
pale blue. Leakage from the 

OUT OF PHASE 



telephone and power lines made 
kaleidoscopic patterns overhead. 
His back felt warm. 

Warm? 

He switched to visual again and 
searched the people's eyes for 
reflections. There— the little 
scared one — his eyes mirrored the 
fence, the hurricane fence. Gate 
spaced with ceramic insulators. 

He started to slow down his 
mind, speed up the world. The 
drop inched, fell to the ground 
with slow purpose; struck and 
flowered into tiny droplets. 

Sound welled up around him. 

“ — on't have to use the gun.” 

Braxn stumbled back toward 
the electrified fence, manufactur- 
ing adrenalin to substitute for his 
spent strength. His stomach knot- 
ted and flamed with impossible 
hunger. He received the pain and 
cherished it. 

The leader advanced for the 
kill, bold and cocky, switchblade 
in his right hand, his left swinging 
a bicycle chain like a stubby 
lariat. 

Braxn secreted a flesh-colored, 
rubbery coating over his body 
and, on top of that, a thin layer 
of saline mucus. 

“Left-handed retiarius,” he 
mumbled under his breath. 

The leader brought the chain 
around in a swift, flat arc, face- 
high. Braxn reached back and 
made contact with the fence. 

The chain cracked Braxn high 
on the right cheekbone and whip- 

57 



ped around the back of his head, 
the end of it putting out his left 
eye. There was a low, sixty-cycle 
hum. His good eye saw the hood 
give one spastic jerk and crumple 
to the ground. 

He looped the chain around the 
little one’s neck and pulled him 
into the fence. Four to go. 

They had backed away, 
somewhat bewildered. One took 
a step toward Braxn, faltered, 
then turned and ran. The others 
bolted and followed him. 

Basking in the pain of his shat- 
tered face, Braxn leisurely reached 
out with his mind and sorted their 
garbled thoughts. Unfortunately 
all four had grasped the signifi- 
cance of his trick with the fence 
and none should be allowed to 
spread the tale, however un- 
believable. 

To buy time he stopped the 
blood flow to their brains tem- 
porarily. Each one collapsed 
before he reached the end of the 
alley. He carried them back and 
carefully arranged them around 
the fence. Carefully, for it was 
delicate work. Braxn erased their 
memories of the past few hours. 
He substituted the memory of an 
elaborate and vicious practical 
joke which ended with all of them 
being knocked unconscious by the 
charge from the fence. 

All fixed up. But time enough 
for a special little treat for the 
leader, Cleve, who had caused 
him to go to all this trouble. 

58 



He studied the man’s still 

figure. Dirty blond hair, low 

forehead, drooping moustache not 
quite hiding an unsightly mole at 
the corner of his mouth. Black 
leather shirt tight over flaccid 

muscles, beer belly, faded blue 
jeans tucked into black boots. 

With little effort Braxn redid 

his own exterior in the shape of 
Cleve. But he took the details, 
not from reality but from the 
twisted self-image in Cleve’s dim 
brain. 

Thus the biceps were a little 
larger, the face a little meaner 
than a lying mirror would reflect. 
Flat belly and hair blond almost 
to the point of whiteness. Instead 
of the ugly mole there was an 
incredibly virile scar that lanced 
down to his chin, catching the 
corner of his mouth down into 
an arrogant sneer. Grade-B movie 
syndrome. 

He manipulated a couple of 
glands and the real Cleve woke 
up instantly. He caught sight of 
Braxn. His eyes narrowed and he 
rose slowly to his feet. He kept 
his distance and stared. 

Sure of Cleve’s attention, Braxn 
started his performance. 

The strong, manly face blurred 
for an instant and came back into 
focus. The scar was a puffy, in- 
fected seam that defiled a face 
no longer vigorous or handsome. 
It pulled down the lower lip to 
expose a yellow canine. The face 
was lined with a delicate tracery 

GALAXY 



of worry and pain, the grooves 
growing deeper and more complex 
in front of Cleve’s horrified eyes. 

The hair, sprinkled with gray, 
grew white and W'as gone except 
for a dirty stubble on the twisted, 
knobby chin. Face and body 
wasted away. Wrinkled parchment 
stretched tight over a leering 
death-mask. 

Bloodshot eyes clotted with 
rheum. Cataracts clouded and 
blinded them. The lids closed and 
collapsed inward and the 
body — real only in the minds of 
two disparate creatures — was 
mercifully dead. 

The skin turned gray, then 
olive, and released its life-grip on 
the ancient body. The body puffed 
up again in macabre burlesque 
of its younger brawn. It lived 
again for a short time as maggots 
fed on its putrescence. 

Then a dry, withered husk, still 
standing upright. The last vestiges 
of skin and flesh sloughed off 
to reveal a brown-stained skeleton 
filled with nameless cobw'ebs. It 
collapsed with a splintering clat- 
ter. 

On top of the pile of gray dust 
and bones the yellow skull glared 
balefully at Cleve for a long mo- 
ment and then, piece by piece 
the whole grisly collection started 
to reassemble itself. 

Cleve had been trying to scream 
for nearly a minute. Finally he 
let out a little squeak and fainted. 

Braxn made sure he would be 



out for a while, then erased from 
Cleve’s memory the specific de- 
tails of the experience. He left 
only a gnawing, undirected feeling 
of horror. 

He scanned the silent forms 
around him and found that they 
were all still unconscious. One, 
the little one, was dead. Probing 
further, Braxn dissolved a blood 
clot, patched an infarction and 
shocked the still heart back into 
action. Pity to spoil good art. He 
liked the combination of cause- 
and-effect and dumb luck causing 
only the harmless one to die. Sur- 
vival of the fittest, eugenics will 
out, and all that. With a mental 
shrug Braxn walked off to find 
a cab. 

ffA H, ENTER, by all means.” 

U Llarval slipped into the 
Survey Chiefs cabin with trepida- 
tion. He was in for a bad time. 

The Chief, who looked like a 
cross between a carrot and a 
praying mantis, got right to the 
point. 

“Llarval. your reports stopped 
coming in several cycles ago. 
From this I infer that A) your 
scout is dead, not likely; B) he 
got disgusted with your asinine 
questions and lectures, rather 
more likely; or C) he w'ent on 
one of his blasted binges and is 
busily turning the autochthones 
into quatrains and limericks. I 
find this last alternative the most 
probable, if the least palatable.

He is ;i G'drellian, an adolescent

“Yes, sir. That means he’s in

“It means he should have been 
locked up before we got within 
a parsec of this primitive world. 
You should not have sent him 
down on the surface of this world

ing your captain. You may 
be — you may have been — in 
charge of ethnological research 
but certain decisions are not 



implemented without my okay.” 
“But, sir, after his initial ex- 
periments he stopped killing them. 
I made him stop. He might have 
drawn attention to himself.” 
"Your devotion to objectivity 
is most commendable. 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“It shows that you know and 
appreciate the first rule of con- 
tact.” He pressed a stud and one 
wall became transparent. He 
gestured at the busy scene beneath 
them. “Are they aware of our 
presence?” 



OUT OF PHASE 



61 



“Of course not, sir. That is 
the first rule.” 

“Tell me, Llarval. What sort 
of radiation would you suppose 
their eyes are sensitive to?” 

The captain’s addiction to ob- 
liqueness was most exasperating. 

“Well, sir, since their planet 
goes around a yellow star, their 
organs of vision are most sensitive 
to a narrow band of radiation 
centered around the yellow 
wavelengths.” 

The captain scraped his thorax 
with a claw. Llarval interpreted 
this as applause. His race had 
forgotten sarcasm eons before the 
captain's had invented lire. 

“You are a good study, Llar- 
val.” 

“Thank you, sir." 

“So we make the ship 
transparent to these wavelengths 
at great expenditure of power.” 

“Yes, sir. So the natives' 
development won’t be influenced 
by premature knowledge of — ” 

“And with similar expenditure 
of power we extend this 
transparency down to the longer 
wavelengths. Why do we do this, 
Llarval?" 

The little ethnologist was 
perplexed. Even the lowliest cabin 
boy could answer these questions. 

“Why, of course, sir, it’s to 
make the ship invisible to radar 
detection. Only it’s not really in- 
visible. It’s just that the local 
implicit coefficient of absorption 
becomes asymptotic with — ” 

62 



“Llarval.” The captain sighed. 
“I learned one of those creatures’ 
words the other day. 1 suppose 
by now you’ve run into i t 
also — catechism.” 

“Yes, sir.” Llarval squirmed. 
“Now' as far as I can tell, 
though I’m not a man of learning 
myself, this is a form of stylized 
debate. One person asks a series 
of questions. The answers are so 
simple that they brook no 
disagreement or misinterpretation. 
These answers — forced, as it 
were, upon the hapless inter- 
rogatee — lead to an inevitable 
conclusion, which gains a spurious 
validity through sheer tautological 
mass. Is that fairly accurate?” 
Llarval paused for a second to 
retrieve the sentence’s verbs as 
the captain had mischievously, if 
appropriately, switched from 
English to Middle High German. 
“Yes, sir. Very accurate.” 
“Well, then.” The captain gave 
a gleaming, metallic smile. “To 
borrow another of their delight- 
fully savage concepts, the coup 
de grace. How did we know — long 
before we came within range — ?” 
“Radio broadcasts, sir, and 
television.” 

“Which means?” 

“Sir, I’m aware of — ” 

“You’re aware of the fact that 
our arty friend could gain control 
of this planet-wide network and, 
in a matter of seconds, destroy 
almost every intelligent being on 
the planet. Or perhaps worse, 

GALAXY 



reduce them to gibbering animals. 
Or worse still, increase their un- 
derstanding of themselves beyond 
the threshold ■ — ” 

“Yes, sir.” 

I .larval could fill in the blanks. 

“Then, get out of here and let 
more capable minds deal with the 
situation.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The ethnologist started to scut- 
tle toward the door. 

“And. Llarval — remember that 
your captain, like most of the 
members of this expedition, nor- 
mally communicates mind-to- 
mind and receives your surface 
thoughts even when they are not 
verbalized.” 

“Yes, sir,” he said meekly. 

“Your captain may be a ‘pom- 
pous martinet,’ yes, but really, 
Llarval — ‘a vegetable that walks 
like a man?’ Racism is, I think, 
singularly inappropriate in an 
ethnologist. Make an appointment 
with the psychiatric staff.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And on your way down, check 
at the galley and see if Troxl 
has a couple of years’ work for 
you to do.” 

The captain watched the 
disconsolate creature scurry out. 
He settled down at his desk. He 
passed a claw over a 
photosensitive plate. 

Computer, he thought. 

Here, Captain. 

Where the he!! is that G’drellian 
poet?

dummy thought waves exactly out

And by combining the two pat- 
terns . 

How do yon know he isn't just 
on the other side of the planet? 

The captain sighed. A computer 
will talk on one subject forever, if 
you let it. 

Using the planet's satellites as 
passive reflectors, I can cover 
ninety percent or more of the 
planet's surface. And by integrat-

All right. Have Stores send me 
up a winter outfit. I'll have to 
go and try to blackmail him into 
telling me where his blasted prog- 
eny is. 

Give him a thousand u'itlcss 
ethnologists, thought the captain 
to himself. Give him a thousand 
garrulous computers but spare 
him the company of even one 
G’drellian. Even on G’drell they 
confined the adolescents to one 
island — to work out. their poetry 
on worms and insects and each 
other.

A survey expedition needed a 
G’drellian, of course. A mature 
one to solve problems beyond the 
scope of the computer. But damn 
that Brohass! He must have 
known lie was gravid when he 
volunteered for the trip. How did 
one deal with these creatures, who 
seem to live only to torment other 
people with their weird, i n - 
scrutable sense of humor? Brohass 
knew he would undergo fission, 
knew his offspring would reach 
adolescence in mid-voyage — and 
probably contrived to send the 
ship to a planet where . 

The captain’s reverie was 
broken by the robot from Stores. 

“The clothing you requested, 
sir.” 

“Just put it on the hook there.” 

The robot did so and glided 
out of the room. 

He should have had it delivered 
to the locker, thought the captain. 
Clothing was tantamount t o 
obscenity to many of the crew 
members and one had to maintain 
dignity. 

Yes, one must, mustn't one? 
thought the computer. 

Will yon go do something 
useful? 

The captain threw up a block 
in time to miss the reply. He 
jerked the clothes off the hook 
and strode out of the cabin, letting 
out occasional thoughts about the 
ancestry, mating habits, etc., of 
the machine that was the ship’s 
true captain. 



ASTEIM your seat belts, 

1 please.” The slender stew- 
ardess swayed down the aisle, past 
a young man with a handsome, 
placid face and a Brooks 
Brothers suit. “Landing at Ken- 
nedy International in three 
minutes.” 

Braxn did as told, shifting the 
heavy attache case from his lap 
to the floor. Two hundred pounds 
of gold bullion would buy a lot 
of prime time. 

They landed uneventfully. 
Braxn took a helicopter to the 
Pan American Building, went 
down to the 1 3 1st floor and into 
an office. Gold leaf on the frosted 
glass entrance proudly proclaimed 
Somebody, Somebody and Some- 
body, Advertising Counselors. 

He came out two hundred 
pounds lighter, having traded the 
gold for one minute of time — at 
nine Saturday night, an hour 
away — on each of the major 
television and radio networks. A 
triumph of money over red tape. 
His commercial would be strictly 
live, with no chance of FCC in- 
terference. And his brand of soap 
would certainly make the world 
a cleaner place to live in. 

Alone. 

T HE captain donned his thermal 
outerwear and entered the mas- 
sive locker. Sure enough, there 
was a huge blue stalactite 
suspended from the ceiling. He 
addressed it.

GALAXY 



Brolwss, he thought obse- 
quiously, would you serve your 
captain? 

The huge icicle fell and splin- 
tered into several thousand pieces. 
They reassembled into a creature 
who looked rather like the cap- 
tain. 

“What would you do to me 
if 1 said no?” 

“That’s ridiculous,” said the 
captain, somewhat emboldened by 
facing a familiar shape. “No one 
can do anything to harm you.” 
“All right, that settled, will you 
please go and let me get back 
to my conversation.” 

Curious in spite of himself, the 
captain asked, “Whom are you 
conversing with? You don’t 
generally think with the other 
crew members.” 

“My father has found a par- 
ticularly humorous ninth-order 
differential equation. He is ex- 
plaining it to me and I would 
like to devote all of my energy 
to understanding.” 

The captain shivered, not just 
from cold. Brohass’ father had 
been dead for thirty years. But 
half of him would live as long 
as Brohass lived— a quarter would 
live as long as Braxn. And so 
on down the line. It was unsettling 
to mere mortal beings, that a 
G’drellian maintained an autono- 
mous existence within his decend- 
ants for hundreds of thousands 
of years after physical death. 
Whether a G’drellian would ever 



die completely was problematical. 
They claimed that none yet had. 

“This won’t take much of your 
time. I want you to locate Braxn 
and give him a message.” 

“Why can’t you find him 
yourself?” 

“It’s a rather large planet, 
Brohass, and he’s thrown up a 
strong communication block.” 

“We’re on a planet? Which 
one?” 

The captain thought a long 
string of figures. “They call it 
Earth.” 

“I’m afraid I’m unfamiliar with 
it. Please open your mind and 
let me extract the relevant de- 
tails.” 

The captain did so, with 
chagrin. Brohass could easily have 
asked the computer but his people 
were born voyeurs and never 
would pass up the chance to probe 
another’s mind. 

“Interesting, savage — I can see 
why he was drawn to it. Inci- 
dentally, your treatment of Llarval 
was shameful. In his place you 
would have lost control of my 
son just as quickly. And your 
knowledge, Captain, of the people 
on this planet, is encyclopedic 
but imperfect. You misunderstand 
both catechism and tautology. 
You used the expression coup de 
grace where coup de theatre 
would have been more fitting. 
And your Middle German would 
send a Middle German into con- 
vulsions. Furthermore, you are an

in assessing my son’s plans. He

“Brohass!” 

“Captain?” 

“Aren’t you going to do

“Interfere with my child’s 
development?” 

“He’s going to kill four billion 
entities!” 

“Yes — he probably is. Mam- 
mals, though. You have to ad- 
mit they’d probably never make 
anything of themselves anyhow.” 

“Brohass, you must stop him.” 

“I'm pulling your spindly leg, 
Captain. I’ll talk to him. Just 
once, just once I would like to 
have a captain who could take 
a joke. You know, you vegetable 
people are unique in the civilized 
universe in your — ” 

“How much time do you 
have?” 

“Oh, two thousand three hun- 
dred thirty-eight years, four days 
and — ” 

“No, no — -how much time 
before Braxn gets on the air?” 

“If Braxn got on the air he 
would fall to the ground — even 
as you and I.” 

The captain made a strangling 
noise. 

66 



“Oh, don't bust a root. I have 
several seconds yet.” Brohass 
reverted to his native formlessness 
and sent a tendril of thought 
through his son’s massive block. 

B RAXN. This is your father. Will 
you slow clown just a bit? 
Braxn concentrated and the 
bustling studio slowed down and 
froze into a tableau of suspended 
action. Yes, Father. Is there 
something l can help you with? 

Well, first, tell me what you’re 
doing in a television studio. 

At the minute of maximum 
saturation I’m going to broadcast 
the Vegan death-sign. That’s all. 

That’s all? You'll kill 
everybody. 

Well, not everybody. Just those 
who are watching television. Oh. 
yes, I've worked out a phonetic 
equivalent for simultaneous radio 
transmission. Get a few more that 
way- — if it works. 

Oh, I’m sure you can do it, 
son. But, Braxn, that’s what l 
wanted to think to you about. 

You’re going to try to think 
me out of it. 

Well, if you want to put it 
that way.

You know that vegetable that

Hey; that’s a good one, Father. 
When’d you .

anything that l . Brohass sigh- 
ed. Look, Braxn. You’re poaching 
on a game preserve. Worse, 
shooting fish in a barrel. With 
a fission bomb, yet. How can you 
get any satisfaction out of that? 

Lather, I know that quantity 
is no substitute for quality. But 
there are so many here! 

Brohass snorted. 

And you want to be poet 
laureate, right? 

There’s something wrong in 
that? This will be the biggest epic 
since Jkdir exterminated the . 

Braxn. Braxn — my son. You’re 
temporizing. You know what's 
wrong, don’t you? Surely you can 
feel it. 

Braxn fell silent as he tried 
to think of a convincing counter- 
argument. He knew what was 
coming. 

The fact is that you are matur- 
ing rapidly. It’s time to put away 
your blocks — sure, you can go 
through with this trivial exercise. 
But you won’t be poet laureate. 
You’ll be dunce of the millen- 
nium, prize buffoon. You’re too 
old for this nonsense. I know it, 
you know it and the whole race 
would know it eventually. You 
wouldn’t be able to show your 
mind anywhere in the civilized 
universe. 

He knew that his father was 
thinking the truth. He had known 
for several days that he was ready 
for the next stage of development 
but his judgment was blinded by 

OUT OF PHASE 



the enormity of the canvas lie 
had before him. 

Correct. The next stage awaits 
you and I can assure you that 
it will be even more satisfying 
than the aesthetic. Yon have a 
nice planet here and you might 
as well use it as the base of your 
operations. The captain is easily 
cowed — after I assure him that 
you no longer wish to, shall we 
say, immortalize these people in 
verse, he’ll be only too glad to 
move on without you. We’ll he 
back to pick you up in a century 
or so. Goodbye, son. 

Goodbye, Father. 

The filament of the green light 
on the camera facing him was 
just starting to glow. He had 
something less than a hundredth 
of a second. 

Extending his mental powers to 
the limit, he traced down every 
network and advertising executive 
who knew of the deal he had 
made. From the minds of hun- 
dreds of people he erased a 
million memories. substituting 
harmless ones. Two hundred 
pounds of gold disappeared back 
into thin air. Books balanced. 

Everyone in the studio had the 
same memory: five minutes ago 
a police-escorted black limousine 
screeched to a halt out front, and 
this man, familiar face lined and 
pale with shock, stormed in with 
a covey of Secret Service men 
and commandeered the studio. 

Braxn filled out his face and 

67 



body with paunch. The man who 
owned this face died painlessly 
as soon as Braxn had assimilated 
the contents of his brain. The 
body disappeared. His family and 
associates “remembered” that he 
was in New York for the week. 

A finger of thought pushed into 
another man’s heart and stopped 
it. Convincing — he was over- 
worked and overweight, anyhow. 
But to be on the safe side, Braxn 
adjusted his catabolism to make 
it look as if he had died ten 
minutes earlier. He manufactured 
appropriate cover stories. 

All this accomplished, Braxn 
let time resume its original rate 
of flow. 



The light winked green. 

A voice offstage said, “Ladies 
and gentlemen — ” what else could 
one say? — “the, uh. Vice Presi- 
dent of the United States.” 

Braxn assumed a tragic and 
weary countenance. 

“It is my sad duty to inform 
the nation . .”

So like the moon, with eyes upon the void, 

We might with effort glimpse an asteroid 
At dim remove; below us in the sand 
Crow sturdy roots, defiant as a band 
Of outlaws: beaten back though not destroyed. 
They fight, with strength and doggedness alloyed. 
Against the blows of Nature's brutal hand. 

The huge extensive caps that melt and freeze 
Lend moisture to the dusty atmosphere , 

And spur the efforts of the shrubs to grow; 

In pools of melted ice perhaps appear 
Scant forms of protozoan life that seize 
A transient space between the months of snow.

LARRY NIVEN 





I T WAS noon of a hot blue day. 

The park was lively with raised 
voices and bright clothing, chil- 
dren and adults. The geriatrics 
generation had come early enough 
to claim a bench and was otd 
and feeble enough to hold it. 

I had brought a sandwich 
lunch. I ate slowly, saving out 
an orange and a second can of 
beer for later. The populace 



69 



danced before me, never dreaming 
that I was watching. 

The afternoon sun burned 
warm on my scalp. A lizaidlike 
torpor stole over me, so that the 
sound of adult voices and chil- 
dren’s screaming-for-the-hell-of-it 
dimmed and faded. 

But I heard the footsteps. They 
jarred the earth. 

I opened my eyes and saw the 
rammer. 

^ He was six feet tall and 
massively built. He wore a scarf 
and a pair of blue balloon pants, 
not too far out of style, but they 
didn’t match. What they exposed 
of his skin was loose on him, 
as if he had shrunk within it. 
Indeed, he looked like a giraffe 
wearing an elephant’s skin. 

He walked without spring. His 
feet slapped hard into the gravel 
with all his weight behind them. 
Small wonder I had heard him 
coming. By now everyone in sight 
was either looking at him or 
turning to see what everyone was 
looking at. Except the children, 
who had already lost interest. 

To me he was irresistible. 

There are always the casual 
peoplewatchers. They watch their 
neighbors in restaurants, shops or 
monorail stations when they have 
nothing else to do. They develop 
their own amateurish tech- 
nique — they don’t know what to 
look for and they usually get 
caught. But I’m not that kind of 
peoplewatcher. 



There are the fanatics, the 
dedicated ones, who learn their 
technique in a closed-circuit TV 
class. Many of them hold lifetime 
subscriptions to Face In The 
Crowd and Eyes Of The City, 
the hobby magazines. They write 
letters to the editor telling how 
they spotted Secretary-General 
Haruman in a drugstore and he 
looked unhappy. 

That’s me. The fanatic type. 

And here I was, not twenty 
yards from a rammer, a man from 
the stars. 

He had to be one. His taste 
in clothing was odd and his 
carelessly draped skin was alien. 
His legs had not yet learned to 
cushion his weight against Earth’s 
heavier gravity. He projected the 
discomfort and self-consciousness, 
the interest, surprise and pleasure, 
that silently shouted tourist. 

His eyes, looking out from 
behind the ill-fitting mask of his 
face, were bright, blue and happy. 
My staring rudeness was noticed 
but did not affect his almost 
religious joy. Nor did his feet, 
though they must have hurt. His 
smile was dreamy and very 
strange. Lift the corners of a span- 
iel’s mouth with your forefingers 
and you’d see such a smile. 

He drew in life from the sky 
and the grass and the voices and 
the growing things. I watched his 
face and tried to read it. Was 
he the priest of some new Earth- 
worshipping religion? No. Prob-

nbly he was seeing Earth for 
l lie first time, was tuning his 
biorhythms to Earth for the first 
time, feeling Earthweight settle 
into his bones, watching sunrises 
twenty-four hours apart until his 
very genes told him he was home. 

It made his day when he saw 
the boy. 

T HE boy was around ten, a 
handsome child, naked and 
tanned all over. When I was 
growing up even the infants wore 
clothing in public. I had not 
noticed him until now and he in 
turn had not noticed the rammer. 
He kneeled on the path that pass- 
ed my bench, his back toward 
me. I could not see what lie was 
doing but he was very intent and 
serious about it. 

By now most of the passersby 
had turned away — from disin- 
terest or an overdose of good 
manners. I eyed the rammer 
watching the boy. 1 studied him 
from half-closed eyes, practicing 
my famous imitation of an old 
man asleep in the sun. The 
Heisenberg Principle implies that 
no peoplewatcher should allow 
himself to be caught at it. 

The boy stooped suddenly, then 
rose, his hands cupped. Moving 
with exaggerated care, he turned 
from the gravel path and crossed 
the grass toward a dark old oak. 

The rammer’s eyes went big 
and round. All his pleasure gave 
way to horror and then the horror 

PASSERBY 



drained away, leaving nothing. 
The star-man’s eyes turned up 
in his head. His knees began to 
buckle. 

Stiff as I am these days, I 
reached him. I slid an admittedly 
bony shoulder under his armpit 
before he could fall. All the mass 
of him came gratefully down on 
me. 

I should have folded like an 
accordion. Somehow I got the 
rammer to the bench before [ 
had to let go of him. 

I told an astonished matron, 
“Get a doctor.” 

She nodded briskly and wad- 
dled away. I turned back to the 
rammer. 

Sick eyes looked up at me from 
under straight black bangs. The 
rammer’s face was oddly tanned 
— dark where the sun could 
reach, white as milk where folded 
skin cast shadows. His chest and 
arms were like that too. Where 
the skin was pale it had paled 
further with shock. 

“No need for doctor,” he 
whispered. “Not sick. Something 
I saw.” 

“Sure. Put your head between 
your legs. It'll keep you from 
fainting.” 

I opened my remaining beer. 

“I will be all right in a mo- 
ment,” he said from between his 
knees. He spoke the Tongue oddly 
and his weakness further slurred 
the w'ords. “It was the shock of 
what I saw.” 

71 



' “Here?” 

“Yes. No. Not entirely — ” 

He stopped to shift mental 
gears and 1 handed him the beer. 
He looked at it as if wondering 
which end to suck on, then half- 
drained it in one desperate 
draught. 

“What did you see?'’ I asked. 

He had to finish swallowing. 

“1 saw an alien spacecraft. 
Without the spacecraft it would 
have meant nothing.” 

“What kind of ship was it? 
Smithpeople? Monks?” 

These are the only known 
spacegoing races, aside from 
ourselves. I'd never seen one of 
their ships but they sometimes 
docked on the outer worlds. 

The rammer's eyes narrowed in 
his quilted face. 

“I see. You think I speak of 
some registered alien ship in a 
human spaceport.” His words 
were no longer slurred. He picked 
them with care. “I was halfway 
between the Horvendile and 
Koschei systems, shipwrecked at 
the edge of lightspeed, waiting to 
die. And I saw a golden giant 
walking among the stars.” 

“A humanoid? Not a ship?” 

“I — thought it was a ship. I 
can’t prove it.” 

I made a thoughtful, wordless 
sound, unwilling to commit myself 
but letting him know I was listen- 
ing. 

“Let me tell you. I was a year 
and a half out from Horvendile, 

72 



bound for Koschei. It would have 
been my first trip home in thirty- 
one years . .” 

F LYING a ramship under sail 
is like flying a spiderweb. 

Even with the web retracted 
a ramship is a flimsy beast. Cargo 
holds, external cargo netting and 
hooks, pilot cabin, life-support 
system and the insystem fusion 
motor are all contained in a rigid 
pod barely three hundred feet 
long. All else is balloons and 
webbing. 

At takeoff the balloons are fill- 
ed with hydrogen fuel for the 
insystem fusion motor. By the 
time the ship reaches ramscoop 
speed the fuel is half gone, 
replaced by low-pressure gas. The 
balloons are retained as meteor 
shielding. 

The ramscoop web is super- 
conducting wire, thin as spider- 
web, tens of thousands of miles 
of it. Coiled for takeoff, it 
forms a roll no bigger than the 
main pod. Put a uniform negative 
charge on it and it spreads to 
form a hoop two hundred miles 
across. It ripples at first under 
the differentiating fields. 

Interstellar hydrogen, thin as 
nothing, enters the mouth of the 
ramscoop web. An atom to a 
cubic centimeter. Differentiating 
fields compress it along the axis, 
compress it until it undergoes 
fusion. It burns in a narrow blue 
flame, yellow- tinged at the edges. 

GALAXY 



Hie eleclromagnetic fields in 
fusion flame begin to support the 
ramscoop web. Mighty forees add, 
making web and flame and in- 
coming hydrogen one interlocking 
whole. 

A rigid pod, invisibly small, 
titles the flank of a whispy cylin- 
der of webbing two hundred miles 
across. A tiny spider on an enor- 
mous web. 

Time slows down, distances 
compress at the higher velocities. 
Hydrogen flows faster through the 
web— the ramscoop fields in- 
crease in power. The web becomes 
more rigid, more stable. 

A ship should not need super- 
vision as it approaches the mid- 
point turnover. 

‘'I was halfway to Koschei,” 
said the rammer, “carrying the 
usual cargo — genetically altered 
seeds, machine prototypes, spices. 
And three corpsicles — passengers 
frozen for storage. We carry 
anything that cannot be sent by 
message laser. 

“I still don’t know what went 
wrong. I was asleep. I had been 
asleep for months, with a current 
pulsing through my brain. Perhaps 
a piece of meteoric iron entered 
the ramscoop. Perhaps the 
hydrogen grew thin for an hour, 
then thickened too fast. Perhaps 
we entered a sharply bounded 
OH+ region. In any case 
something twisted the ramscoop 
field and the web collapsed. 

“I was wakened too late. The 



web had roman-candled and was 
trailing the ship like a parachute 
that will not open. Wires must 
have touched for much of the 
web was vaporized. 

“It was my death,” said the 
rammer. “Without the ramscoop 
weh I was falling helplessly. I 
would enter the system of Koschei 
months loo early, moving at near- 
ly lightspecd, a dangerous missile. 
For my honor I must inform 
Koschei by laser — so that I might 
be shot down before I arrived.” 
“Take it easy." I soothed him. 
His jaw had clenched, and the 
muscles that tightened in his face 
patterned the skin like a jigsaw 
puzzle. “Relax. It's all over. Smell 
the grass — you’re on Earth now.” 
“I wept helplessly at first, 
though we consider weeping un- 
manly.” The rammer looked 
around him as if coming awake. 
“You are right. Would the law 
take offense if l took off my 
shoes?” 

“No.” 

He took off his shoes and wig- 
gled his toes in the grass. His 
feet were too small for him. His 
toes were long and agile, almost 
prehensile. 

N O DOCTOR had appeared yet. 

Probably the matronly woman 
had simply walked atxay to avoid 
being involved. In any case, the 
rammer’s strength had returned. 

Ffe said, “On Koschei we tend 
to large girth. Gravity pulls less 

73 



PASSERBY 



heavily at the meat of us. To 
qualify as a rammer I sweated 
away half my body weight, so 
that the unneeded two hundred 
earthweight pounds of me could 
he replaced by payload cargo." 

“You must have wanted the 
slats badly.” 

“Yes. I was simultaneously 
learning disciplines whose very 
names most people can neither 
pronounce nor spell.” The ram- 
mer pulled at his chin. The quilted 
skin stretched incredibly and did 
not snap back immediately when 
he let go. “1 cut my weight by 
half, yet my feet hurt when 1 
walk the Earth. My skin has not 
yet shrunk to fit my smaller 
mass. Perhaps you noticed.” 

“What did you do about 
Koschei?” 

“I sent the message. It would 
precede me to Koschei by just 
two ship's months.” 

“Then?” 

“I thought to wait it out, to 
use what time was left to me. 
My taped library was ade- 
quate — but even in the face of 
death, I grew bored. 

“After till, I had seen the stars 
before. Ahead they were blue- 
white and thickly clustered. To 
the side they were orange and 
red and somewhat sparse. Behind 
was black space, empty but for 
a handful of dying embers. Dop- 
pler shift made my velocity more 
than obvious. But there was no 
sense of motion. 

74 



“A month and a half of this 
and 1 was ready to go back to 
sleep. 

“When the collision alarm went 
off, I tried to ignore it. My death 
w'as already certain. But the noise 
bothered me, and 1 went to the 
control room to shut it off. 1 
saw then that a respectable mass 
was quickly approaching, aimed 
dangerously, from behind. It was 
moving faster than my own ship. 

1 searched among the sparse 
crimson dots w'ith my scope at 
top magnification. Presently I 
found a golden man walking 
toward me. 

“My first thought was that I 
had gone mad. My second was 
that my God had come for me. 
Then, as the intruder grew in the 
scope screen, l saw that it was 
not quite human. 

“Somehow that made it better. 
A golden man walking between 
the stars was impossible. A golden 
alien was a lesser impossibility. 
At least 1 could examine it sanely. 

“1 found the alien larger than 
I had thought, much larger than 
human. It was a biped, definitely 
humanoid, with two arms and legs 
and a well-defined head. Its skin 
glowed all over like molten gold. 
It was hairless and without scales. 
Between its legs was nothing but 
smooth skin. Its feet were strange, 
without toes, and the knee and 
elbow joints were bulbous and 
knobby — ” > 

“Were you really thinking in 

GALAXY 



big expensive words like that?” 
"I really was. I wanted to forget 
that I was terrified.” 

‘Oh.” 

“The intruder was nearing fust. 
Three times 1 had to lower the 
magnification. Each time 1 saw 
him more clearly. His hands were 
three-fingered, with a long middle 
finger and two thumbs. The knees 
and elbows were too far down 
the limbs but seemed quite flexi- 
ble. The eyes — ” 

“Flexible? You saw them 
move?” 

T HE rammer became agitated. 

He stuttered; he had to stop to 
gain control of himself. When he 
spoke again he seemed to force 
the words through his throat. 

“[ — decided that the intruder 
was not actually walking. But as 
it approached my ship it seemed 
to be walking on empty space.” 
“Like a robot?” 

“Like a not-quite man. Like 
a Monk, perhaps, if we could see 
beneath the garment worn by 
Monk ambassadors.” 

“But—” 

“Think of a man-sized human- 
oid.” The rammer would not let 
me interrupt. “Think of him as 
belonging to a civilization ad- 
vanced beyond our own. If his 
civilization had the power, and 
if he had the power within his 
civilization, and if he were very 
egotistical, then perhaps,” said the 
rammer, “perhaps he might com- 

PASSERBY 



rnand that a spacecraft be built 
in his own image. 

“That is the way I thought of 
the intruder in the ten minutes 
it took him to reach me. I could 
not believe that a humanoid with 
smooth, molten gold skin would 
evolve in vacuum — or that he 
could walk on emptiness. The hu- 
manoid shape is for gravity, for 
planets. 

“Where does engineering be- 
come art? Once our ground- 
bound automobiles looked like 
spacecraft. Surely an advanced 
spacecraft might be made to look 
like a given man and to move 
like him. yet still have the 
capabilities of a spacecraft. The 
man himself would ride inside. 
If a king or millionaire could 
cause this to be done — why, then 
he would stride like a god across 
the stars.” 

“1 wonder if you don't think 
(if yourself in just that way.” 

The rammer was astonished. 
"Me? Nonsense. I am a simple 
rammer. But 1 find man-shaped 
spacecraft easier to believe in than 
golden giants walking on emp- 
tiness.” 

“More comforting, too.” 

“Yes.” The rammer shuddered. 
"It came up very fast, so that 
I had to damp the magnification 
to keep him in view. His middle 
finger was two joints longer than 
ours and the thumbs were of dif- 
ferent sizes. His eyes were set 
freakishly far apart and too low 

75 



in the head. They glowed reel with 
their own light. His mouth was 
a wide, lipless, horizontal line. 

“Not once did 1 think to avoid 
the intruder. We could not have 
reached a collision course by ac- 
cident. I assumed that he had 
altered course to follow me and 
would alter course again to pro- 
tect us. 

“He was on me before I knew 
it. I had flipped the magnification 
down another notch and when I 
looked the setting was at zero. 
I looked up at the sparse red 
stars and found a golden dot as 
it exploded into a golden man. 

“1 blinked, of course. When my 
eyes opened he was reaching for 
me.” 

“For you?” 

The rammer nodded con- 
vulsively. 

“For the pod of my ship. He 
was much larger than the pod, 
or rather, his ship was.” 

“You still thought it was a 
ship?” 

I would not have asked- — but 
he kept changing the pronoun. 

“I was looking for windows in 
tire forehead and the chest. I did 
not find them. He moved like 
a very large man.” 

“I hate to suggest it,” I said, 
“not knowing your religion. Could 
there be gods?” 

“Nonsense.” 

“How about superior beings? 
If we’ve evolved beyond the 
chimpanzees, couldn’t — ■” 

76 



“No. Absolutely not,” said the 
rammer. “You don't understand 
modern xenogeny. Do you not 
know that we and the Monks and 
the Smithpeople are all of equal 
intelligence? The Smithpeople are 
not remotely humanoid in shape, 
yet it makes no difference. Evolu- 
tion stops when a species begins 
to use tools.” 

“Fve heard that argument. 
But—” 

“When a species begins to use 
tools — environment no longer 
shapes that species. The species 
shapes its environment to suit 
itself. Beyond this the species 
does not develop. It even begins 
to take care of its feebleminded 
and its genetically deficient. 

“No, he could have better tools 
than mine, this intruder, but he 
could not be my intellectual 
superior. He was certainly nothing 
to worship.” 

“You seem awfully sure of 
that,” I snapped. 

I NSTANTLY I regretted saying 
so. The rammer shivered and 
wrapped his arms around his 
chest. The gesture was ludicrous 
and pitiful at the same time, for 
his arms swept up an armful of 
folded skin and hugged it to him. 

“I needed to be sure. The in- 
truder had taken my main pod 
in his hand and pulled me 
toward — toward his ship. 

“I was glad of my crash straps. 
Without them I'd have bounced 



GALAXY 



about like a pea in a dryer. As 
it was, I blacked out for an in- 
stant. When 1 opened my eyes 1 
faced a great red iris with a black 
pupil. 

“He looked me over with care. 
I— forced myself to look back, 
lie had no ears, no chin. A bony 
ridge divided his face where a 
nose might have been, but there 
were no nostrils. He pulled back 
for a better view of the main 
pod. This time I was not jolted. 
I le must have realized that the 
jolting could hurt me and had 
done something to prevent it. 
Perhaps he had made his ship 
inertialess. 

“1 saw him lift his eyes mo- 
mentarily to see over my pod. 

“You must remember that I 
was facing back along my own 
wake, back toward Hor- 
vcndile — to where most of the 
stars had been red-shifted to 
black,” The rammer was picking 
his words with increasing care and 
patience. They came so slowly 
that 1 wanted to squirm. “I was 
not looking at the stars. 
But — suddenly there were a 
million clustered stars, and they 
were all white and bright. 

“I did not understand. I put 
side and forward views on the 
screen. The stars looked the same 
in all directions. Still I did not 
understand. 

“Then I turned back to the 
intruder. He was walking away 
across the sky. 

PASSERBY 



“You must understand that, as 
he walked, he receded at much 
faster than walking speed. Ac- 
celerating. In a few seconds he 
was invisible. I looked for signs 
of an exhaust but saw none. 

/‘Then T understood.” The 
rammer lifted his head. “Where 
is the boy?” 

The rammer looked about him, 
his blue eyes searching. Children 
and adults looked back curiously 
for he was a weird sight. 

He said, “I do not see the boy. 
Could he have left?” 

“Oh, that boy. Sure, why not?” 

“There is something I must 
see,” 

The rammer eased his weight 
forward onto his bare and bat- 
tered feet. I followed him as he 
crossed the gravel path, followed 
him onto the grass. And the ram- 
mer resumed his tale. 

“The intruder had examined me 
and my ship with care. He had 
made himself and my ship iner- 
tialess or otherwise cushioned us 
against acceleration. Then he had 
canceled our velocity relative to 
Koschei.” 

“But that wasn't enough,” I 
objected. “You’d still die.” ■; 

The rammer nodded. 

“Still, at first I was glad to 
sec him go. He was terrifying. 
And his last mistake was almost 
a relief. It proved that he 
was — human is not the word I 
want. But he could make 
mistakes.” 

77 



, “Mortal,” I said. “He was 
mortal.” 

“I do not understand. But never 

mind. Think of the power of him. 
In a year and a half, at point 
six gravities, I had accelerated to 
a velocity which the intruder can- 
celed in no more than a second. 
] preferred death to his dreadful 
company. At first. 

“Then I became afraid. It 
seemed unjust. He had found me 
halfway between stars, stranded, 
waiting to die. He had half-saved 
me — and then left me to die, no 
better off than before! 

“I searched for him with the 
scope. Perhaps I could signal him 
if I knew where to aim my com 
laser. But l could not find him. 

“Then I became angry. I — ” 
The rammer swallowed. “I 
screamed insults after him. I 
blasphemed in seven different 
religions. The more distant he was 
the fess I feared him. I was 
reaching my stride when — when 
he returned. 

“His face was outside my main 
window. His red eyes looked into 

mine. His strange hand was 
reaching for my main pod. My 
collision alarm was just beginning 
to sound — his return had been so 
sudden. I screamed out — I 
screamed — ” He stopped. 

“What did you scream?” 

“Prayers. 1 begged for forgive- 
ness.” 

“Oh.” 

“He took my ship in his hand. 

78 



I saw the stars explode before 
me.” 

T HE rammer and I had reached 
the shade of a dark oak, one 
so old and so spread out that 
its lower limbs needed the support 
of iron pipes. A family picnicking 
beneath the tree watched our ap- 
proach. 

“Explode?” 

“That lacks accuracy,” the 
rammer apologized. “What hap- 
pened was this — the stars became 
very much brighter, at the same 
time converging toward a point. 
They flared horribly. I was blind- 
ed. The intruder must have shifted 
me to within a meter-per-second 
of lightspeed. 

“I rubbed my hand hard across 
my eyes. My eyes remained clos- 
ed. 1 felt acceleration. It remained 
constant while I waited for my 
eyes to recover. Through ex- 
perience I was able to estimate 
its force at ten meters per second 
squared.” 

“But that's — ” 

“One gravity. When I could see 
again 1 found myself on a yellow 
plain beneath a glaring blue sky. 
My pod was red hot and was 
already sagging round me.” 
“Where did he put you?” 

“On Earth, in a refertilized part 
of North Africa. My pod was 
never built for such things. If 
Earth’s gravity collapsed it, then 
reentry should have torn it to 
pieces. But the intruder must have 

GALAXY 



taken care of that, too, I guess.” 

I AM a peoplewatchcr, an expert. 

I can crawl into a man’s mind 
without letting him know I ex- 
isted. I never lose at poker. And 
I knew the rammer was not lying. 

We stood beside the dark oak. 
I'lie lowermost limb grew almost 
parallel to the ground and was 
supported by three iron pipes. 
Long as were the rammer’s arms, 
he could not have wrapped them 
around that limb. Its bark was 
rough, gray, powdery and smelled 
of dust. The top of it was level 
with the rammer’s chin. 

‘‘You're a very lucky man.” I 
said. 

“No doubt. What is that?” 
Black and furry, an inch and 
a half long — one end wiggling in 
blind curiosity as it moved along 
the bark. 

“A caterpillar. You know, 
there’s no computing the odds you 
ran against being alive now. You 
don’t seem very cheerful about 
it.” 

“I w'as — but think about it,” 
said the rammer. “Think what the 
intruder must have reasoned out 
to do what he did. 

“He looked through the main 
window to examine me as well 
as he could. I was tied to a chair 
by crash straps and his sensors 
had to see through thick impact 
quartz designed for transparency 
in the other direction. He could 
see me but only from the front. 

PASSERBY 



He could examine the ship. But 
it was damaged and he had to 
guess to what extent. 

“First he must have reasoned 
that f could not slow my ship 
without the ramscoop web. But 
he must also have deduced the 
presence of reserve fuel to 
decelerate me to zero speed from 
the lowest speed at which my 
ramscoop can operate. It was 
apparent that I must have it. Thus 
he stopped me dead — or nearly 
so — and left me to go home the 
slow way, using only my 
reserve fuel. 

“After he had left me lie must 
have realized that I would be dead 
of age before I ended such a trip. 
Imagine how thorough his exam- 
ination of me must have been. 
So he came back for me. 

“By projecting my line of flight 
he must have knowm where I was 
going. But could I live there with 
a damaged ship? He did not know. 

“And so he looked me over 
more carefully, deduced the star 
and planet where I must have 
evolved — and he put me there.” 

“That’s pretty far-fetched,” I 
said. 

“Yes. The solar system was 
twelve light years distant — yet he 
reached it in an instant. But that 
is not the point.” The rammer 
let his voice trail off. He seemed 
oddly fascinated by the black 
caterpillar, which was now defying 
gravity as it explored a vertical 
wall of bark. “He placed me not 

79 



only on Earth but in North Africa. 
He deduced not only my planet 
of origin but the region where 
I bad evolved. 

“I stayed in my pod for two 
hours before ] was found. Your 
United Nations police took a 
record of my mind but they do 
not believe what they found. A 
ramship pod cannot be towed to 
Earth without radar’s finding it. 
Further, my ramscoop web is all 
over the desert. Even the 
hydrogen balloons survived the 
reentry. They think that it must 
be a hoax, that 1 was brainwashed 
as part of that hoax.” 

“And you? What do you 
think?” 

Again the rammer’s face 
tightened into jigsaw-puzzle lines. 

“1 had convinced myself that 
the intruder was no more than 
another spacecraft pilot — a 
passerby who stopped to help, as 
some persons will stop to help 
if your car battery fails far from 
a city. His power might be greater 
than mine. He might be wealthier, 
even within the context of his 
own culture. We were of different 
species. Yet he had stopped to 
help a member of the great 
brotherhood, for we were both 
spacemen.” 

“Because your modern 
xenogeny says he couldn’t have 
been your superior.” 

He didn’t answer. 

“J can pick a few holes in that 
theory.” 

SO 



“Can you?” 

I ignored his disinterest. “You 
claim that evolution stops when 
a species starts building tools. But 
suppose two tool-users evolved on 
the same world? Then evolution 
might go on until one race was 
dead. We might have had real 
problems if the dolphins had had 
hands.” 

“It may be.” He was still 
watching the caterpillar — an inch 
and a half of black fur exploring 
the dark bark. My ear brushed 
the bark as 1 faced him. 

“Then again, not all human 
beings are alike. There are Ein- 
steins and there are morons. Your 
passerby might have been of a 
race that varies more. Make him 
a super-Einstein — ” 

“1 had not thought of that. 1 
had assumed that his deductions 
were made with the aid of a com- 
puter. At first.” 

“Then, a species could evolve 
itself. If they once started fiddling 
with their genes they might not 
stop until their children were mile- 
high giants with a space drive 
stuck up their spines. What the 
hell is so interesting about that 
caterpillar?” 

“You did not see what the boy 
did?” 

“Boy? Oh. No, I didn’t.” 

“There was a — caterpillar 
moving along the gravel walk. 
People passed. None looked 
down. The boy came. He stooped 
to watch.” 



GALAXY 



“Oh?” 

“Presently the boy picked up 
(lie caterpillar, looked about him, 
then came here and put the cater- 
pillar safely on the limb.” 

“And you fainted.” 

“I should not have been so 
affected by what, after all, is no 
more than a comparison. I would 
have cracked my skull had you 
not caught me.” 

“A poor return for the golden 
one, if you had.” 

The rammer did not smile. 



“Tell me — if an adult had seen 
the caterpillar, instead of a 
boy — ” 

“Probably he’d have stepped on 
it.” 

“Yes, I thought so.” The ram- 
mer put his tongue in his 
cheek, which stretched incredibly. 
“He is nearly upside down. 1 hope 
he will not fall off.” 

“He won’t.” 

“You think he’s safe?” 

“Sure. Don’t worry about him.”

JOHN FORTEY 



T WO MEN walk slowly down the 
street. It is evening. A slight 
wind blows dust and dead leaves 
past them, plays with their hair.

brushes his hair from his eyes. 
I he wind as easily returns it. 

They halt at the corner, 
sheltered for a moment from the 
breeze. The older man produces 
cigarettes and each takes one. 
Their destination is the building 
opposite, a gray construction of 
old, stained concrete, crumbling 
at the edges. The older man stud- 
ies the face of his dark-eyed 
companion in the flare of the 
match. He looks for signs of ner- 
vousness, of fear, finds none. Both 
men inhale, blow clouds of gray 
smoke into the gray night air. 
They smoke in silence for a few 
minutes. Finally the younger man 
smiles resignedly and glances at 
his wristwatch. 

“Time for me to go, Ivan,,” 

The other sighs deeply. Few 
words are left unsaid — they have 
discussed everything. 

“I wish you luck, Stefan.” 

They clasp hands firmly. Stefan 
turns, crosses the street and enters 
the building. 

A third man approaches, dress- 
ed in flowing robes of black, his 
head hooded. Walking swiftly, 
black robes flapping, he follows 
Stefan through the doorway, 
glancing once in Ivan’s direction. 

Ivan involuntarily steps back 
into deeper shadow, feeling his 
breath speed up, his heart thump 
a little louder, faster. Under the 
man’s dark cowl, revealed for a 
second by that one swift glance, 
he has caught a glint of silver. 

CITADEL 



The notice above the doorway 
reads: evening classes. 

O N SALISBURY Plain, five miles 
from Stonehenge, stands the 
Citadel of the Brotherhood. It is 
a structure of shimmering metal, 
two miles in height, a full half 
mile across at the base. It tapers, 
in a logarithmic curve, to a point. 
At various heights are balconies 
open to the air — but those more 
than two thousand feet from the 
surface enclosed with a 
transparent substance. The main 
structure is formed of a titanium- 
steel alloy. No joints or welds 
are discernible. The structure ap- 
pears: to have been cast or carved 
from a mass greater than it. 

Pulse modulated signals of 
various wavelengths have been 
intercepted emanating from the 
Citadel on several occasions. One 
such signal, wavelength 27.48 
Mc/s, was immediately identified 
as television but faded before a 
coherent picture could be obtain- 
ed. Other electrical phenomena 
have been observed in the vicinity, 
most notably jamming of all radio 
reception up to a range of three 
miles and a form of St. Elmo’s 
Fire persisting for several hours. 

It would seem almost impossi- 
ble to believe that such a structure 
could be erected without arousing 
the curiosity of the local populace, 
yet such appears to be the case. 
Bondsmen, when questioned in its 
very shadow, knew nothing of it 

83 



and admitted to no interest at all. 

The Citadel was raised in April, 
1987. It was completed in two 
days. No details as to the struc- 
tural methods used have been ob- 
tained. 

T HE thirty-fourth meeting of 
the Society of the Spider took 
place in a Berlin cellar. Berlin, 
city of spies for almost fifty years, 
now held the last spies on earth. 
The cellar stank of dust and old 
wine. Broken glass crunched un- 
derfoot and mice scuttled in the 
shadows. Sixteen of the members 
had met here regularly for over 
two years, discussing, planning, 
arguing. These men sat com- 
fortably, in silence. 

Of the remaining two, one was 
a new member. The hypnotic 
brand of his initiation still smarted 
in his subconscious. He sat for- 
ward in his seat, staring at the 
dimly lit faces around him, jump- 
ing at every unexpected sound. 
The other was the founder of the 
society, Ivan Petrov. Absent from 
meetings for a month, he had 
returned, bringing with him the 
new member, Stefan Alderton. 
Petrov spoke. 

“Gentlemen. All of u s 
here- — with the exception of Ste- 
fan — are familiar with t h e 

Brotherhood artifacts. We have 
discussed them often and sug- 
gested possible uses or reasons 
for their existence. Stefan, on the 
other hand, had not beard of them 

84 



until four days ago. He is a native 
of Kazakhstan, where the 
Brotherhood is still largely 
unheard of. He came west in 
search of his brother. His ex- 
periences of the Brotherhood, 
although brief, are, however, more 
intimate than anyone else here can 
claim.” 

He paused, glancing at Aider- 
ton. 

Alderton supplied: “I found my 
brother. He is now a Priest of 
this Brotherhood.” 

Petrov continued above a mur- 
mur of sympathy: “His lack of 
knowledge underlines the 
deplorable breakdown of com- 
munications over the past ten 
years. 1 shall, therefore, give a 
brief history of the Brotherhood's 
rise to power to clarify matters 
and mainly for Stefan's benefit. 
The artifacts themselves, we shall 
discuss later. 

“The Brotherhood first made 
its appearance in central Europe, 
circa nineteen eighty-three. It 
spread swiftly, mainly via further 
education classes for adults, by 
offering courses based o n 
tachistoscopic film and hypnosis, 
designed to • teach a foreign 
language in days or quantum 
physics in a few hours. It is 
believed that" these courses also 
prepared the student for the next 
step — full initiation into the 
Brotherhood. Wc know very little 
about the details. Much of our 
data is obtained by questioning 

GALAXY 



pupils before they become too 
uncooperative. After several such 
courses most students retreat into 
a world of their own. Priests can 
be immediately recognized by 
their black robes and, more cer- 
tainly, by the metal band each 
wears, apparently inset, around 
the upper part of the head. 
Further, individual Priests appear 
to have no separate self- 
awareness. Each forms a part of 
a group consciousness. 

"in five years the Brotherhood 
won complete control of Europe, 
most of Asia and North America. 
The next five years sufficed for 
them to take command of the 
whole planet. As a result, civiliza- 
tion as we knew it has virtually 
ceased to exist. We are plunged 
again into the Dark Ages, with 
the Brotherhood playing the roles 
of both the nobility and the 
Church. We. the remaining eighty 
per cent of the population, are 
cast as serfs and denied educa- 
tion — unless we wish to submit 
to the teachings of the Priests, 
which inevitably culminate in 
B rot h e r hood membership. 

“This situation is the reason 
for the existence of this society. 
Our purpose is to alter it.” 

Petrov paused again. He stared 
for a long moment at Alderton. 
When he again spoke his voice 
held a soft note of hope, in sharp 
contrast to his previous harsh 
tones. 

“We are all old men here, Ste- 

CITADEL 



fan. Look around you — not one 
of us is below the age of sixty. 
We need a young man who hates 
tiic Brotherhood as we do. Most 
young people accept the present 
situation — or perhaps prefer it to 
the Cold War. They prefer a 
peaceful pastoral existence to the 
threat of nuclear annihilation. But 
you have lost a brother. You 
know this is not the way of prog- 
ress, that we in a cultural 
backwater. We need a man who 
will agree to enter t h e 
Brotherhood for us and fight for 
us from within. 

“You are our choice, Stefan.” 

FED a dog. 

Feed it regularly for six 
months, ringing a bell while it 
feeds. At the end of the six 
months the bell alone, without 
food, is enough stimulus to bring 
saliva to the mouth of the dog. 
A similar effect can be obtained 
with pain — 7 resulting in the phe- 
nomenon of a dog's salivating 
when it is pricked with a pin. 

The dog has acquired a condi- 
tioned reflex. 

Or take a television audience 
of several thousand, all mindlessly 
watching soap opera. Interrupt the 
play f o r advertisements — and 
most of your audience will treat 
it as a chance to make coffee, 
visit the toilet or possibly even 
speak. The few who continue 
watching have probably been 
mesmerized. 

Now, without interrupting the 

85 



play, substitute for a single frame 
the word thirst in capital letters. 
If the frame-speed is fast enough 
no one in your audience will be 
able to read it. It will not be 
on the screen long enough to 
register consciously. Do this three 
more times at intervals of twenty 
seconds. The fifth time, flash 
UEER at them. 

Your audience will rush to the 
nearest public house as one. 

This is subliminal conditioning. 

These and other similarly half- 
understood methods were used on 
Stefan Alderton. The Spider took 
his mind and molded it. His sub- 
conscious was made a minefield 
of hidden reflexes, each designed 
to break through tiny later condi- 
tioning. He endured hours of 
seemingly innocuous scenic film 
while subliminal t e c h n i q u e s 
sprayed him with new concepts. 
His dreams were not his own. 
Each night a muted speaker under 
Ins pillow whispered to his mind, 
which was unhindered now by 
coherent thought. 

Only his mornings were free. 
Most of them were spent with 
Petrov — walking, talking. He told 
over and over again the story of 
his brother's eagerness to travel 
West, to go to the great schools 
now being opened, to learn as 
much as possible of the world 
around him. 

And of their last meeting. 

Each time he told the story 
it was as if he lived that moment 

06 



again, stood again in the small 
room with its odor of books and 
chalk dust, felt again the heat 
from the single shaft of sunlight 
that fell directly onto h i s 
face— and saw again the blank, 
unrecognizing stare of his brother. 
That unseeing stare could be 
found on the face of any and 
every Priest. Stefan painfully 
recalled looking around the room, 
nothing that although there were 
five other Priests in the room, 
not one of them bothered to look 
directly at him. 

There had been no need for 
them to look at him — they had 
been able to see him through the 
eyes of his brother. 

His sudden shocked realization 
of this fact had made him want 
to vomit. He had run from the 
room, forgetting his coat in his 
haste. 

Ivan had found him two days 
later, drunk, money all gone, 
wanting only revenge. Ivan had 
dragged his story from him many 
times, knowing that his hatred 
would burn the fiercer if con- 
stantly stoked— and would help 
Stefan persevere in bis quest for 
vengeance. 

The lessons continued for six 
weeks. 

Satisfied at last. Stefan’s tutors 
released him. He and Petrov 
traveled to England, where he 
enrolled in the Brotherhood- 
controlled night school nearest to 
the Citadel. 



GALAXY 



Six months passed. During it 
no contact was attempted by 
Spider. Alderton was watched 
from a distance but not very 
carefully. 

f Until he was reported wearing 
black robes and a metal ring in 
his skull. 

T HE Western Desert of Aus- 
tralia sports the second Brother- 
hood artifact. Known as the Pat- 
tern, this structure consists of rods 
of a pink substance (presumed 
plastic but to date no sample has 
been available for analysis) of 
various widths laid out in a com- 
plicated design and covering 
roughly two hundred and fifty 
square miles. The rods vary in 
length, the longest being up to 
thirty feet, the shortest less than 
an inch. 

p Although Priests can be seen 
walking freely through the Pat- 
tern, no other animal life can exist 
closer than about five hundred 
yards. Even at this distance severe 
headaches and invol untar y 
twitchings of the limbs is usual 
in humans. Birds and other 
wildlife avoid this area but tests 
with guinea pigs and rats show 
them suffering acutely at a 
distance and dying if placed closer 
than five hundred yards. It is not 
known if these symptoms are a 
; result of the Pattern or some form 
of protection designed to keep 
i unwanted visitors away from the 
area. 

CITADEL 



Photographs taken front high- 
altitude drones show the Pattern 
to be roughly hexagonal in shape 
and resembling a gigantic 
snowflake. 

As with the Citadel, no function 
has been postulated for this struc- 
ture. 

T HE BODY of Stefan Alderton 
walked slowly towards the great 
door set in the steel wall that 
towered above the clouds. Six 
months of evening classes had 
taken his mind. He wore a metal 
ring in his skull. 

Two members of S p i d e r 
crouched in a parked car a quarter 
of a mile away, watching a radar 
screen. The thin beam of electrons 
traced its green path across the 
screen, peaked in the center, and 
flicked back to the beginning two 
thousand times each second. The 
peak, first, told that the X- 
band transmitter hidden in Stefan 
Alderton’s left forearm was still 
functioning and second, it gave a 
direction. 

Another car parked two miles 
east, bonnet in the air and a 
mechanic frantically d o i n g 
nothing, gave a second direction. 
A third car, containing at first 
glance a courting couple, gave a 
third. 

All three tracking stations lost 
Stefan as he entered the steel shell 
of the Citadel. 

Sensing fulfillment, Spider 
assembled in the village which lay 

87 



practically at the foot of the metal 
spire. Its patience was rewarded 
at the end of the third day of 
waiting. Once more a peak formed 
on the flickering green trace. 

The cage of the Citadel had 
released its willing prisoner. 

T HE function of the third 
artifact is known. Unfortunately 
its location is not. It was built 
in France and is an enormous 
ceramic ball of almost three 
kilometers diameter. On March 
5, 1986, at 10.05 hours local 
time, it rose from the ground and 
headed rapidly due north, gaining 
altitude as it proceeded. No 
rockets or other motors were 
observed but the area from which 
it was launched was later found 
to be radioactive, although not 
dangerously so. It was last seen 
three days later — by sheer acci- 
dent — some twenty Astronomical 
Units away by an astronomer, Mr. 
G. Kerry, who was carrying out 
routine photography of the Orion 
constellation. This area of the sky 
is of especial interest as several 
pulsars have been recently located 
here which are believed to corres- 
pond with known, visible stars. 

The only starship successfully 
launched by mankind, the sphere 
has been seen by some five hun- 
dred men. Its existence is known 
to perhaps four times that num- 
ber — excluding, of course, Priests. 

Further details of its trajectory 
will be available when the Kerry 

83 



photographs have been examined. 

T WO men huddle under a laurel 
hedge at the very base of the 
Citadel. They whisper — partly in 
awe, partly from fear of being 
detected, although no one else is 
in sight. 

“He's on that ledge — about sev- 
en hundred feet up.” 

“I see it.” Petrov stares up until 
his whole back aches. “How long 
lias be been there?” 

“Four hours. From back 
there — ” he gestures to a line of 
trees a mile distant — “you can 
just make him out with 
binoculars. He just stands there. 
He hasn’t moved all this time.” 
‘"A nightwatchman, perhaps? 
Sentry?” " 

“We're dealing with one mind. 
Petrov, not a group.” He smiles 
with pleasure at being able to re- 
peat back to Petrov what the 
leader himself has said until it 
is almost a motto. “He watches 
the night but lie isn't a man. Not 
as we use the term.” 

Their whispering ceases as the 
sound of footsteps becomes audi- 
ble. A Priest appears, walks 
slowly past without pausing or 
glancing either way. Starlight 
glints on bis shining headband, 
making it glow. The even tread 
fades and the two men straighten. 

“We’ll have to try to reach 
him,” Petrov decides. 

“What? Up seven hundred feet 
of polished steel?” 



GALAXY 



“No, I mean reach him mental- 
ly. He’ll come to us if we can 
do that.” 

“We’ll lose him altogether if 
he breaks contact with the rest 
of the Brotherhood,” objects the 
other. 

Petrov ignores him, sucking his 
bottom lip thoughtfully. 

“We’ll use the flares.” 

“But we can’t risk it now.” 

Petrov stares him down. 

“Go back. Tell them. The 
flares.” ' 

The other hesitates, makes to 
argue further, then turns and 
crawls through the hedge. In a 
few moments Petrov is left alone 
with the night and the Citadel 
towering above him. The top is 
invisible but he can just see the 
ledge on which Alderton stands, 
silhouetted against the low cloud. 

Twenty minutes pass. Then, 
over by the line of trees, five 
Very lights flicker a colored pat- 
tern across the sky. 

The pattern mirrors one already 
in the strange mind of Stefan 
Alderton. 

The watchers in the trees see 
the figure on the high balcony 
stagger, jerk arms and legs like 
a marionette — and fall. 

Seven hundred feet. Men have 
fallen from aircraft at much 
greater heights and lived, their 
falls broken by trees, snowdrifts. 

There are no trees below Stefan 
Alderton and certainly no snow. 
But the walls of the Citadel curve 



outward. He falls two hundred 
feet before they curve sufficiently 
for him to make contact. He 
bounces outward slightly, once, 
and then maintains contact for 
the rest of his fall. His left 
leg flails against the wall and 
smashes beyond any hope of 
repair. The steel ring set into the 
bone of his skull scrapes the shin- 
ing wall for filly feet, sending 
up a shower of brilliant sparks 
and making the whole Citadel 
resonate. 

The curve of the wall increases 
sharply at the base. Friction piles 
on friction as Stefan plunges 
down. The skin is lorn from his 
body. A wet smear is drawn down 
the wall parallel to the glittering 
streak which makes the contact, 
of his headband. 

The last fifty feet, mercifully, 
he begins to roll, and is spun 
away from the tower, to come 
to rest mere yards from the wait-, 
ing Tvan. 

The Citadel hums like a gigan- 
tic tuning fork in the sudden quiet. 

Footsteps. Shouts. Ivan runs to 
the body. 

“Stefan—” 

“Ivan — ” 

The eyes open once and close 
again. The whole incredibly living 
body shudders. The whispered 
greeting is barely audible. 

Ivan forces himself to disregard 
the terrible injuries, the face partly 
torn away and covered with 
blood. 



CITADEL 



89 



“Stefan. The Citadel. The Pat- 
tern, What are they for, Stefan?” 

Stefan shudders again. For a 
moment Ivan thinks Stefan is still 
one with the group mind — mem- 
bers of which must surely even 
now be racing to the laurel hedge. 
But no — Stefan had spoken, Ivan 
lowers his head to Stefan’s. 

“We were right, Ivan,” 
whispers Stefan. “The Priests are 
one. One mind. But oh, how we 
underestimated that mind — how 
we misunderstood it! It is the 
mind of a child, undeveloped. And 
yet it — they — make us look like 
apes.”

“Quickly, Stefan, the Pat-

I READ the news today. James 
Earl Ray will be in court to ap- 
peal his confession. Sirhan Sirhan 
is getting settled in his cell on 
Death Row. Apollo 10 is about 
to re-enter after successful com- 
pletion of the penultimate Lunar 
mission. There is no trace of the 
ground crew sergeant who took 
the Hercules out over the Atlantic 
and asked for one phone call to 
his wife. And got it. 



And that’s some of the news 
of the world of the future. 

If you obtain a copy of AH 
Our Yesterdays, by Harry War- 
ner, Jr., (As you should. From 
Advent: Publishers, Inc., P.O. 

Box 9228, Chicago, 111. 60690. 
$7.50) and read its account of 
the doings and thinkings of 
science fiction people in the 
1940s, you will get more than 
one normally bargains for in a 



91 



book like this. You will get the 
incunabula — the photos of F. 
Towner Ltney ; the personality 
analysis of Walt Dunkelberger; 
the index that revealed to my 
astonished eyes that I’d been 
observed helping to sing a Richard 
S. Shaver lampoon at the 1947 
Philcon. But you will also, I think, 
get more than an inkling of how 
and why it is that some of us 
have to claim a “new thing” to- 
day. For what we mean by the 
“new thing” is a portmanteau into 
which we stuff all the aspects of 
the future we simply did not see 
coming. 

Long one of the most respected 
recorders of events within the 
microcosm of sf fans, Harry War- 
ner has produced here, first of 
all, that calm, reasoned and, 1 
suppose sometimes slightly pre- 
judiced, “fan history” that the 
microcosm needs as a coun- 
terweight to Sam Moskowitz's 
earlier The Immortal Storm. All 
Our Yesterdays concentrates on 
the 1940s. Brief essays first 
establish the prior state of science 
fiction and science-fiction fandom, 
so as to provide a perspective 
in which to view the more closely 
detailed events. Subsequent 
volumes are promised on the later 
decades. Warner several times 
refers to Moskowitz and chides 
his book for being far too con- 
cerned with the pocket struggles of 
New York fandom, and therefore 
for being a significant distortion 

92 



of the lore of the fannish universe. 
(This seems a valid point, 
although it is also true that the 
movers and shakers of the New 
York bush wars are generally still 
significant activists in both pro- 
fessional and amateur science fic- 
tion, whereas most of the other 
major fannish events of the 1940s 
are sunk without trace). 

But some of you may be won- 
dering, even more titan usual, just 
what the hell I’m talking about. 

Well, there is a thing called 
fandom. It is the result of the 
recorded thoughts, and the in- 
creasingly recorded deeds, of folk 
who at some time in their lives 
were moved not only to read 
science fiction but to live in it. 
These people were impelled to 
contact other sf readers and to 
form associations with them on 
the basis of either a mutual in- 
terest in science fiction or of some 
even stronger mutual interest 
discovered as a result of the pre- 
liminary sf contact. Articulate, 
.given to bursts of hyperactivity, of- 
ten consumed by a loneliness de- 
manding Brobdingnabian spasms 
of communication they have 
from their number contributed the 
major portion of today’s science- 
fiction editors, writers, artists. The 
derivative formatists have in turn 
perpetuated science fiction as we 
know it today and as it continues 
to raise fresh generations of fans. 
And these fans, in turn, will some 
day. But before we elaborate 

GALAXY 



on that conclusion, you should 
know that it might well be of 
considerable interest to you to read 
All Our Yesterdays, even if you 
don't recognize anything more 
than the names of the people who 
have since become familiar pro- 
fessionals. (Or well-known scien- 
tists, for that matter. You will 
find their names here in the form 

“Young published two 

issues of a mimeographed maga- 
zine in 1943, but nothing more 
was ever heard of him.”) 

For even if you don't recognize 
any of the names, it is 
nevertheless true that no other 
entertainment literature to my 
knowledge has ever raised up a 
satellite structure of such com- 
plexity that it can — and often 
does — -exist independent of the 
First Cause, nor has any other 
literary genre generated such a 
systematized frame of reference 
in which entire communities of 
outwardly ordinary individuals 
can share the same dramatic in- 
terior life. 

I N FACT, the only thing 1 have 
seen analogous to fandom is so- 
ciety itself. No other institution 
is comparable in its dedicated 
pursuit of the proper attitude, the 
apt message, the most effective 
plan and the noblest future. 
(Modified, of course, by a sober- 
ing realization that out there, 
somewhere, regrettably squats that 
great stultifier, Practicality.) All 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



of us, each in his own words 
and each in his own way, would 
like to try to do something, 
however small, that would im- 
prove Man’s grasp and un- 
derstanding. 

Of what? Well, of the extension 
of the past. 1 think that we in 
the 1940s, pursuing this common 
human trait of simplifying the past 
and calling it the future, believed 
even more than we realized that 
the more efficient machines would 
lead to better men and that the 
larger cities would lead to 
reasonable folk. Oh, some 
doubted it. But not me. 

This is what is to be found 
in Harry Warner’s book even if 
you never heard of and don’t care 
about gafia, crifanac or Morojo. 
It is indeed a history, as dis- 
tinguished from a polemic. The 
specific names and things it cites 
are reflections of real events and 
genuine feelings. And there is 
sense to be made of it even if 
your interest is wholly inde- 
pendent of the particular labels 
this constellation of realities hap- 
pens to have donned for the oc- 
casion. Warner’s opinions are evi- 
dent but unobtrusive; it is possible 
to discern that this microcosm, 
like our larger one, is mostly made 
up of good folk w'ith strong 
personal opinions, is mostly 
motivated towardi improvement, 
certainly less creative than it 
thinks but nevertheless aware of 
creativity’s importance. This 

93 



book, like fandom, is a good 

thing. 

But as I said up there in the 
beginning, even a good thing can 
miss a point. And tiiis, too, is 
not surprising since we do have 
only the past for a hint of what 
the world of the future will bring. 

I would like to illustrate my 
point. I think perhaps I can. Here 
is a column I wrote in April, 

1968, after returning home from 
a business trip. But then 1 re- 
membered that my job is to review 
science-fiction books, not science 
fiction. So I put it aside: 

From the air Washington, D.C., 
looked dusty in the late afternoon. 
In the main terminal at National 
Airport, ticket clerks had been 
suggesting there might be seats 
on flights from Friendship Air- 
port. They had no suggestion as 
to how long it might take the 

regular limousine service to get 
through downtown Washington to 
Friendship, which is near Bal- 
timore. But there were certainly 
no seats to Chicago, Milwaukee 
or St. Louis at National. So 1 

took the shuttle to New York and 
that was how 1 saw the burning 
like a barricade across the city 
at 14th Street. The flames were 
Da-Glo orange. 

My plan was to take a Chicago 
plane from LaGuardia. 1 settled 
for a cab ride to Kennedy and 
the last seat on a flight home 

via Cincinnati. 



The nation’s capital, as I was 
saying, hod been burning. From 
National, with its panoramic win- 
dows, the historical monuments 
along the Potomac had stood out 
clearly against the ropy smoke. 
We had gotten to National, usual- 
ly a twelve-minute cab ride down 
Connecticut Avenue for the 
Shoreham, via Georgetown and 
the Key Bridge. Whether you 
know D.C. or not, what this 
means is that for five tired 
businessmen who had been 
strangers until they struck their 
bargain with the cabbie, the 
Insurrection up to this point had 
been an hour’s traffic jam. 

The flight path from Kennedy 
to Cincinnati crosses Baltimore. 
D.C. is off the left wing. Doubling 
back as 1 was, at something like 
10:00 P.M. local time, now, I 
was sitting in a First Class left 
window seat with a double 
whiskey sour in my hand, partak- 
ing of a little Mozart through the 
headphones of my Astrostereo. 

Washington from the air at 
night is one of the world’s great 
visions. When I see it, I think 
of the superdense cities traced out 
far below our England in the 
Arthur C. Clarke story. It is like 
looking at a scanner display and 
making out the lovely, obviously 
intelligent webworks of an 
aesthetically conscious, persistent 
and prosperous alien people. At 
this time, it had rust-colored, very 
dark streaks across it.

In Cincinnati the bouncy 
stewardess with the Texas accent 
received a message that flight 
crews would not be permitted to 
leave O'Hare Field for their 
homes in Chicago but would have 
to bunk out at the field after 
the flight terminated. She asked 
me what Washington had been 
like. I couldn’t think of how to 
put it. 

“Like World War III,” I said 
and she nodded happily, com- 
prehending. 

But later, when we swung in 
over the West Side of Chicago at 
midnight, she ran up and down 
the aisle, pointing out and crying: 
“Look it thet! Look it thet, my 
Gawd!” 

Well, I got home all right, to 
suburban Evanston, in a cab driv- 
en by a man who blamed the 
whole thing on the Mayor of 
Philadelphia for taking away his 
policemen’s shotguns. I also 
learned that he lived in all inno- 
cence on the 3000 block of West 
Madison and I was his last fare 
before he checked in and went 
home. I’m not really a jerk but 
I didn’t like the way he talked, 
so I just wished him pleasant 
dreams. 

The next day, I checked with 
the local police for reassurance, 
and then my wife, my four sons 
and I got on our six bicycles 
and went up to the Baskin- 
Robbins store on the corner of 
Dempster and Chicago. The 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



youngest is six and I'd promised 
him he could have a ride to the 
ice cream store when I got back 
home from the annual convention 
of Pickle Packers, International, 
a very nice bunch of people I 
no longer work for. 

As I recall, everybody had a 
double dip but David, the 
youngest. Despite his twelve-block 
accomplishment, he settled for 
one dip. The next day being Sun- 
day, we dressed up neatly and 
took the bus to Raymond Park 
for the memorial service. 

W HAT all this has to do with 
science fiction ( I wrote in 
April, 1968) is so obvious that 
its full implications still escape 
me. It was not at all like World 
War III. World War III in the 
movies is accompanied by sirens, 
crashing sounds and the crackle 
of flames. But the common ele- 
ment in all my insulated glimpses 
from real life was the absence 
of sound effects. In all the after- 
noon and evening, I heard one 
klaxon — on an empty ambulance 
headed for the Key Bridge away 
from D.C., probably toward a 
road accident on the chock-full 
highway to Dulles airport. Other 
than that, it was cab motors, tur- 
boprop and jet engines, arrival 
and departure announcements, 
coins dropping into telephones, 
ten pennies in a slot for a copy 
of the Chicago Sun-Times. That, 
and politeness; the very quiet, 

95 



resigned AP wireplloto editor in 
Washington on Friday morning, 
when the headline was still d.c. 
QUibrs down. He said he was 
glad to see me again, hoped I'd be 
back next year, but didn’t really 
t!i ink he’d be able to do much 
with my 8 X 10 glossy of a pretty 
girl unveiling a sculpture of a six- 
foot eagle clutching a 2 Vi -foot 
pickle in its claws. All of us were 
polite; the taxi' man in Washing- 
ton, the five of us in his cab, 
even when we were stuck im- 
movably in that narrow George- 
town Street, with people walking 
rapidly and the hooter getting 
closer and closer. There was no 
shoving or shouting at National; 
the clerks worked quickly and 
without raising their voices. On the 
shuttle, a salesman put his knee 
in my lap while trying to aim 
his Nikon through the window, 
:md 1 was very polite to him. 

It had to be, of all things, a 
stewardess out of Steve Canyon 
who became my only exhibit for 
panic, and it was two other cab 
drivers, one in John Lindsay’s 
New' York and one in Dick 
Daley’s Chicago, who spoke con- 
fidently of locking their doors and 
“driving right through’’ crowds if 
the need ever arose. One thing their 
television viewing has apparently 
failed to show them is a car with 
its four wheels in the air. Or else 
they’ve related it to a movie about 
World War III. At 26.000 feet, 
with Mozart and whiskey sours, 

96 



I gazed with fascinated interest 
on the subterrene jewelery of 
Washington at night and thought 
of Arthur C. Clarke. What dif- 
ference docs it make what you 
relate to? 

What difference? Well, I’m not 
sure. The difference, if tiny, must 
be somew'hcre in the difference 
between the flashy and the endur- 
ing. So much of what we want 
is flash. Flash is often more fun. 
The novel of World War III is 
not popular by accident. And the 
mysterious figure with mysterious 
capabilities, spinning conspiracies 
or, conversely, righting wrongs 
with one morally superior 
stroke — he, too, is an enduring 
archetype among us because there 
are enduring needs within us and 
he meets them. A large part of 
what is generally called “science 
fiction” all in one lump, good 
and bad, flashy and enduring 
together, is wedded and bedded, 
part, parcel and calliope with a 
complex, communicative, com- 
munal, c o m m u t a t i v e , com- 
prehensive social network which 
fosters and battens on the urgent, 
immediate need to make the 
future happen. 

We want to escape from the 
incomprehensible hcre-and-now 
into a simplified world where an 
Avenger sets things right with one 
forceful blow after the “mealy- 
mouth politicians and fuzzy- 
minded social ‘scientists’ have 
muddled it up.” We want to have 

GALAXY 



the Arcturians come down in 
search of Marilyn Monroe and 
knock aside things-as-they-are in 
the process. Wc want a new deal 
for ourselves, by being born again, 
this time fully conscious, into a 
world depopulated by the Plague, 
where all is still and all is 
ours. 

We live in a flash world. The 
dimensions of things have gotten 
worked around to where they are 
larger than life as it was w'hen 
the harmless entertainments of 
Hash fiction were first created. 
Any one man with a degree in 
biochemistry, for instance — one 
poor, miserable, unsung cataclast 
with a mere ten years’ education, 
or just an ordinary lot of luck — 
could make such a Plague. We 
may all be dying tomorrow for 
one man’s gratification of a wish 
which should legitimately be 
sending a hundred thousand of 
us to the newsstands with seventy- 
five cents each for the next John 
Christopher novel. 

You follow me? So much of 
science fiction has nothing to do 
w ith the intrinsic things of science 
fiction. It has to do with the in- 
trinsics of less than perfect hu- 
manity. It is predicated on the 
powcrlessness of the individual, 
rather than on the capabilities of 
the lucky few. The Plague, the 
Arcturians, or the Avenger, arc 
needed to fill the lack of power 
in our lives. 

Or they were. Here in the world 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



of the future, our longed-for ex- 
pertise of things has created in- 
numerable places where once 
powerful authority has no 
monopoly on accomplishment, 
and where there are many weap- 
ons that are best wielded by 
empty hands. If he but be driven 
enough today, any man can be 
his own pulp hero, and those of 
us who want all their thrills 
vicarious will never again nod safe 
in their libraries. 

That’s what it all has to do 
witli science fiction. It has to do 
with the difference between flash 
writing and good writing, because 
good writing is life and flash writ- 
ing is the other thing. Good art 
has to do with life realized. We’ve 
always known that. What some 
of us appear to have missed is 
that life has changed funda- 
mentally, and science fictionally. 

That’s what it has to do with 
science fiction. The greater chunk 
of the old basis is dead as of 
April 4, 1 968. We used to set 
stories on Mars and in the future 
not because we understood those 
places but because w e 
didn’t — which made them totally 
believable places in which to have 
momentous things happen. Life at 
home proceeded apace. But we 
live now in a time in which it 
not only can happen here — you 
name it. and it can happen, good, 
bad and indifferent, provided 
only it’s flashy enough — it not 
only can happen here, it will. •

All Mr. Kraken' s assets were frozen — including his heart! 



G raham kraken lay upon 

his deathbed. His eyes wavering 
upon a dim and faraway ceiling, 
he savored the reassuring words. 

“The odds arc all in your 
favor,” the doctor said. 
n Tlte bed seemed to tense be- 



neath Kraken. Springs coiled 
tautly. 

“Some day—” the doctor’s 
voice rang with tiny, metallic 
chimes — “medical science will 
have advanced far enough to 
revive you. Your frozen body will 



not deteriorate in the interim.” 
The chimes grew hushed. “Some 
day science will repair your body 
and you will live again.” 

Graham Kraken died easily and 
they froze his corpse. 

H E DREAMED that he was in 
Miami Beach and opened his 
eyes. Blinking into the dimness 
of his room, he found a visitor 
seated at his bedside. 

“Good morning,” said the 
visitor. 

The stranger, Kraken noted, 
was an elderly gentleman with a 
bald head and a pleasant face. 

“Good morning,” said Kraken 
in a friendly manner. “Nice ear- 
rings you have there.” 

“Thank you,” said the visitor. 
“They’re antennae.” 

“Oh?” 

"For the transistor radios built 
into my earlobes.” 

“Indeed?” 

“Stereo.” 

“How nice,” said Kraken. 
“How do you turn it off?” 

“Don't,” the visitor responded. 
“Speak up a bit’, please.” 

“I'm sorry, - ’ said Kraken. “I 
didn't know.” 

“Nice weather we’re having.” 

“I hadn’t really noticed. By the 
way, have they done anything 
about that?” 

“Well, they did for a short 
time.” the old gentleman said. 
“But they had to give it up.” 
“Too many conflicting wishes?” 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



“I'm afraid so.” 

“A pity.” Kraken glanced at 
the heavily curtained window. As 
he watched, the glass behind the 
curtains suddenly shattered. 
“Oh?” he said. “Riots?” 

“No,” replied the visitor. 
“Supersonic transports.” 

Another pane of glass au- 
tomatically slipped into place. 

“I guess you get quite a lot 
of that.” 

“Easy come, easy go.” 

“By the way,” Graham Kraken 
asked, “what year is this?” 

‘‘Twenty-eighty-eight,” lie said. 

“Well,” said Kraken, “it has 
been a while.” 

“One year is pretty much like 
another, - ’ said the stranger. 

“How about the money?” won- 
dered Kraken. “Did my estate 
hold out?” 

“I'm afraid nol,” said the 
visitor. “1 had to pay for your 
revival.” 

“That was very kind of you,” 
said Kraken. He noticed the 
sunlight edging the window cur- 
tains. 

He rose upon an elbow. T he 
motion made him feel faint. 

“Please don’t try to move,” the 
visitor said. “It’s important that 
you rest for the heart transplant.” 

“Oh?” Kraken leaned back. “Is 
there something wrong with my 
heart?” 

The visitor stood up slowly. 

“No,” he replied, "but there’s 
something wrong with mine.”

by Willy Ley 



T HOSE who have the tlesire — 
and a reason, plus the neces- 
sary cash — to buy a compound 
that was declared to be impossi- 
ble. can now do so. The name 
of the compound is chlorine pen- 
tafluoride and its chemical for- 
mula, expressed by the name, is 
CIF-.. It is a rocket fuel — or 
rather an oxidizer for a fuel. Well, 
sort of, since it is not truly an 
“oxidizer.” But we shall see. 

Nobody thought of chlorine 
peniafluoride specifically in the 
past, but for the last forty years 
rocket men have been dreaming 
about “something like it." The 
dream was based on one cold 
fact — —a very cold fact in- 
deed — namely the boiling point of 
liquid oxygen at minus 183 



degrees centigrade. Oxygen must 
be colder than that to stay liquid. 
This caused certain handling prob- 
lems and one got to wishing that 
there were a substitute for liquid 
oxygen that stayed liquid at or- 
dinary temperatures. Could one 
use an oxygen-rich substance that 
was liquid over about the same 
temperature range as water — or 
over the temperature range of 
alcohol — and was also inex- 
pensive? Since this was a 
dream — why not throw in a low 
price? 

Since any self-respecting person 
has a chemical handbook or two 
somewhere on the bookshelf it 
became customary to devote 
otherwise unoccupied evenings lo 
looking up oxygen-rich liquid 



100 



compounds. For various reasons 
the molecules of these compounds 
should also be fairly light. There 
was no reason to worry about 
that point, they turned out to be 
compounds of light elements. The 
elements in question, with their 
atomic weights, were: 



Hydrogen (H) 1 

Nitrogen (N) 14 

Oxygen (O) 16 



Since we’ll have to know the 
atomic weights of three other ele- 
ments later on they might be add- 
ed to the list right here. They 
are: 



Fluorine (F) 19 

Sulphur (S) 32 

Chlorine (Cl) 35 1/2 



*• The Vi after 35 in the case 
of chlorine is not a typographical 
error but a fact of nature that 
annoyed chemists for at least 
three-quarters of a century. The 
explanation is that the atoms of 
the common garden-variety 
isotope weigh 35 units each — but 
another chlorine isotope with a 
weight of 37 is just common 
enough to shift the weight of the 
natural isotope mixture by half 
a unit. 

: To return to the theme: the 
reason for checking on various 
compounds was to find an 
oxygen-rich substance that could 
be substituted for pure oxygen in 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



a rocket. At that moment I re- 
membered having been told once 
by my chemistry professor that 
the names of oxygen and of 
hydrogen are both wrong and 
should be reversed. Oxygen means 
“acid maker” but quite a number 
of oxygen-free acids exist. 
Hydrogen means “water maker” 
but no acid exists that docs not 
contain hydrogen and when it 
comes to water hydrogen plays 
a minor role. The formula of 
water is, of course, H O which 
means that the weight of the 
molecule is 2 + 16 = 18. It 

also means that there is quite a 
high percentage of oxygen in that 
stuff; by weight the ratio is 8 
to 1 in favor of oxygen. 

But try to make the hydrogen 
atoms let go of the oxygen. With 
ordinary means it cannot be done 
at all — one reason water was 
thought to be an element for such 
a long time — and it can fairly 
easily be done only when an elec- 
tric current is available. But 
bew'are of memories of classroom 
demonstrations in which a glass 
apparatus was filled with water 
and a little sulphuric acid was 
added "to make the water conduct 
the electric current.” Of course 
you could see the hydrogen ac- 
cumulate at one electrode and the 
oxygen at the other. Of course 
you could see that the hydrogen 
required twice as much space as 
the oxygen. But the electric cur- 
rent did not take the water apart 

101 



directly, even if it looked that 
way. 

What happened is this: 

The electric current took the 
sulphuric acid apart. The formula 
of the acid is H-SO, and the result 
was H 2 (free hydrogen) + SO, 
(sulphur trioxide) + O (an ox- 
ygen atom). The two gases 
hydrogen and oxygen had been 
freed in the ratio of 2 : 1 and 

SO was left behind. The SO,, 
mediately combined with the sur- 
rounding water: SO., + H.O = 
H,SOi so that you had a molecule 
of sulphuric acid again. And then 
the whole cycle started all over 
again, gradually using up the 
water. 

Since the hydrogen atoms 
would not release the oxygen 
atom, water could not be used. 
But compounds with more than 
one oxygen atom in their makeup 
might not be so stubborn about 
it. How about hydrogen peroxide, 
chemically speaking H 2 0„. Any 
chemist who had experience with 
“willing" to split into H„0 and O. 
In fact it was too willing, it did so 
without any visible reason and in 
so short a time that the process 
could only be called an explosion. 

Miss or Mrs. Reader have no 
fear, however. The hydrogen 
peroxide in your bathroom is only 
“a four per cent aqueous solution’’ 
which means that 4 per cent of 
what is in the bottle is hydrogen 
peroxide. The other 96 per cent 
is harmless water. And you could 

102 



not get anything stronger than an 
8 per cent solution, which is still 
safe. Explosions happen when the 
solution is 30 per cent or 
stronger. Chemists with ex- 
perience warn everybody away 
from strong H-O. solutions and 
it took a lot of research during 
the second World War to find 
out why strong H 2 0 2 blew up. 
It happened when the substance 
touched copper and since piping 
usually involved brass fittings 
hydrogen peroxide looked even 
more unsafe than it is. True, it 
has been used but nobody likes 
to work with it. 

N OW, the handbook told of two 
nitrogen compounds that one 
might consider. They were 
nitrogen tetroxide ( N..O, ) and 
nitrogen pentoxide (N a O : .). For 
the tetroxide the weight ratio of 
nitrogen to oxygen in the molecule 
would be 28 : 64; for the pentox- 
ide the weight ratio would be 28 
: 80. Not bad in either case, 
especially since the nitrogen was 
not too likely to combine with 
anything during the combustion 
process and would, one could 
hope, simply appear as gaseous 
nitrogen in the exhaust. But the 
chemists with experience shook 
their heads again: unsafe. 

By now N 2 0, is made and is 
available in tank car lots. Ap- 
parently one merely had to learn 
a technique of handling it. But 
thirty years ago the bad ex- 

GALAXY 



pcriences of some researchers left 
only one substitute for liquid ox- 
ygen that could be used: nitric 
acid. The formula is HNCL so 
that the atomic weights in the 
molecule add up: 1 + 14 + 
48. Hence the weight ratio of 
oxygen to hydrogen-plus-nitrogen 
was 48 to 15, or a little better 
than 3 to 1. It would need a 
more detailed analysis of the 
combustion process to show 
whether the nitric acid would 
relinquish its oxygen easily or not. 
And after analysis — on 
paper — had shown that it would, 
it would need some experimen- 
tation to verify the assumptions 
made for the calculation. 

Of course anybody with even 
the most rudimentary knowledge 
of chemistry knows that nitric 
acid is by no means a peaceful 
substance. But at least it would 
not blow up. 

And most folks also know by 
now that quite a number of 
rockets, among them very big 
ones, use nitric acid as a substitute 
for oxygen. 

When rockets using nitric acid 
were still comparatively small 
somebody asked whether one 
should not have a look at fluorine. 
Fluorine behaves like oxygen, 
only more so. It reacts with prac- 
tically anything it can reach, even 
causing flames in the process. 
Most of the time no ignition is 
needed. The compounds produced 
are fluorides instead of oxides but 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



a description of fluorine as a 
super-active oxygen is reasonably 
correct. One has to add, though, 
that it is horribly poisonous. 
Hence pure fluorine w'as unlikely 
to find practical application on 
a large scale. But how about 
fluorine-rich substances which 
might do the job with somewhat 
dampened violence? 

The Office of Naval Research 
thought that the idea deserved 
some investigation and gave a 
contract to the research division 
of the Propellant Chemistry sec- 
tion of Rocketdyne, builder of 
rocket engines in Canoga Park, 
California. The manager of the 
research division, E. A. Lawton, 
gave the assignment to Dr. Walter 
Maya and Dr. Maya went to 
work. This was in 1961. 

The work involved a mixture 
of fluorine and chlorine both of 
which are gases at room tem- 
perature. Compounds of fluorine 
and chlorine then known included 
CIF, consisting of just one atom 
of each, and CIP 3 , chlorine 
trifluoride. The gases behaved as 
expected but left just a trace 
of another compound. There was 
so little of it that all one could 
say at the moment was that the 
unexpected — and possibly new — 
compound strongly absorbed 
radiation of a wavelength of 
13.7 microns, which is in the in- 
frared region of the spectrum. 

The next step was obvious, 
though very difficult. It entailed 

103 



making enough of the compound 
for its molecular weight to be 
determined. The weight turned out 
to be 130'/2 . That awkward V 2 
was. of course, due to chlorine; 
subtracting 35 V 2 from 130 V 2 
gave 95 which is five times the 
weight of the fluorine atom. If 
the new compound did not con- 
tain anything else the substance 
had to be chlorine pentafluoride, 
something that had never been 
made before, one atom of chlorine 
holding on to five atoms of 
fluorine. The next step was to 
prove that the compound con- 
sisted of chlorine and fluorine 
only. 

Once that was done and the 
nature of the new compound had 
been definitely established it was 
comparatively easy to think of a 
number of ways of making it — the 
reaction by which it had been 
obtained originally was much too 
slow to satisfy anybody. One bet- 
ter way was via a compound with 
the metal cesium, CsCIF,, cesium 
chlorotetrufluoride, reacting with 
more fluorine. The gas formed 
after condensation proved to be 
CIFr.. In 1963 the researchers had 
about 15 pounds of the new com- 
pound — enough to establish all its 
characteristics. 

Chlorine pentafluoride is color- 
less, both as a liquid and as 
a gas. Its odor is similar to that 
of fluorine — it is toxic but far 
less violent than pure fluorine. 
Below minus 103 degrees cen- 



tigrade ( = minus 153.4 degrees 
Fahrenheit) it is solid. Above 
minus 14 degrees centigrade ( = 
7.3 degrees Fahrenheit) it is a 
gas. Its density is 2.022 grams 
per cubic centimeter at minus 54 
degrees centigrade ( = minus 65 
degrees Fahrenheit) while the 
density is 1 .793 grams per cubic 
inch at 20 degrees centigrade ( = 
68 degrees Fahrenheit). 

The precise molecular weight 
is 130.44. 

The question of how C1F 5 will 
do in a rocket engine has only 
theoretical answers so far. If 
Rocketdyne has run any actual 
tests on the teststands they don’t 
say so. Its value as a fluoridizer 
is about the same as that of liquid 
oxygen as an oxidizer. But CIFr, 
can be stored (under its own 
vapor pressure) at normal tem- 
peratures. It has the advantage 
of being heavier than liquid ox- 
ygen which means that more of 
it can be put into a given tank. 
A likely rocket fuel for use with 
CIFr, is hydrazine, the mixture ra- 
tio being about 2.6 parts (by 
weight) to one part of hydrazine. 

And that is as far as the story 
has progressed at the moment. 

Picture Writing in 
Our Time 

T HE place of the story was and 
still is one of the Frisian islands 
in the North Sea. The time was 
the summer of 1912, vacation

GALAXY 



lime, and one of the vacationers 
on that island was a staff member 
of the Ethnographic Museum in 
Leipzig. 

There was not much a vaca- 
tioner could do in such a place 
in those days. One could go swim- 




made by the old woman to assist 
her memory about the errands she 
ran. 

The ethnologist, for a tip, ac- 
quired a no longer needed page 
of the notebook (see figure) and 
the explanation. The round object 





tiling, one could watch seagulls 
and sandpipers and one could also 
watch people. Among the people 
the vacationer watched was an 
old woman who bustled around 
from house to house and came 
to the inn with packages. The 
innkeeper, when asked, said that 
the old woman was a general 
messenger, the illiterate widow 
of a fisherman. She earned a little 
money by running errands. 

The ethnologist was not espe- 
cially curious until he watched the 
old woman scribbling in a 
notebook — hadn’t the innkeeper 
said that she, like most others 
of her generation, was still 
illiterate? He managed to get a 
look at the notebook. It did not 
contain a single letter but was 
full of pictures that looked like 
childish drawings. They had been 




at the extreme left in the top 
row that might be a picture of 
a potato actually meant rice the 
old woman had been asked to 
fetch from town. The second ob- 
ject meant soup greens. The circle 
with two lines meant a sponge 
on a string and the square next 
to it meant a portable slate, then 
customary for grades one, two and 
three in grade schools. Somebody 
was learning to write! The sketch 
to the right of the slate was sup- 
posed to be a pot, the sign next 
to it that looks like a small b 
probably indicated the customer. 
The sign is repeated once more 
later. 

To the right of the pot we have 
a somewhat drastic pictogram, 
somebody wanted “worming 
medicine" — whether for man or 
beast is unclear. To the right of

it a cluster of signs referred to 
wine. The bottle shape is the 
general indicator. The repeated b 
meant the same customer who 
wanted the pot. The four circles 
meant four bottles. The sign at 
the extreme right in the top row 
was supposed to show a pig — but 
not a live one. It was intended 
to be read as ham or pork. 

The drawing to the left in the 
bottom row is a whole sentence: 
the messenger was to tell the 
butcher that he should come to 
the village to slaughter a pig and 
that he should bring two pig blad- 
ders with him. The drawing to 
the right in the bottom row 
meant: deliver a letter from the 
blacksmith to his wife-to-be. 

The page from the notebook 
of the messenger woman was 
placed into the archives of the 
museum in Leipzig. An enlarged 
photograph was put on public 
display. Learned discussion of the 
find was not too fruitful. The old 
woman knew of writing — she 
simply could not do it herself. 
So she had invented a 
substitute. But what would she 
have done if nobody in her area 
knew how to read and write — in 
other words if the concept of 
writing had been unknown to her? 

Nobody could answer that 
question, of course. 

But that interesting notebook 
leaf still indicates how writing, 
elsewhere, and several thousands 
of years earlier, must have started.

Astronautics 

International 

N OT quite two years ago, in the 
December, 1967, issue of Gal- 
axy, I pointed out that the con- 
quest of space was not just a 
race between the Soviet Union 
and the United States. Other 
countries also contributed. I spoke 
about the French satellites; there 
were a total of five, three of them 
orbited by the French Diamant 
rocket. I spoke of the Italian 
satellites, two of them, and of 
the British and Canadian 
satellites, all of which were col- 
laborations with the United States. 
The countries in question had 
furnished the satellites. The 
United States had furnished the 
rockets. 

Since then more things have 
happened in that field. At about 
the time the readers of Galaxy 
read that particular issue an 
American rocket roared into the 
sky from the Australian Woomera 
Proving Ground, carrying an 
Australian satellite. Its designa- 
tion was WRESAT, meaning 
(Australian) Weapons Research 
Establishment Satellite. It was or- 
bited on November 29, 1967, and 
stayed in orbit until January 10, 
1968. 

The next three international 
satellites that were successfully 
orbited — one was destroyed by 
one of the rare failures of the 

GALAXY 



Scout rocket — all belonged to 
ESRO, the European Space 
Research Organization. ESRO-I1, 
I lie first to reach orbit, is called 
Iris. It was put into orbit on May 
17, 1968, and is still orbiting. 
ESRO-I, named Aurora, followed 
on October 3, 1968, and is also 
still in orbit. The third of the 
three ESRO satellites is the most 
interesting. 

It is called HEOS-A; the letters 
stand for High Eccentricity Orbit 
Satellite and the eccentricity is in- 
deed high. The perigee of that 
satellite is only 273 miles from 
the surface but its apogee is 
139,458 miles out in space, a 
little more than halfway to the 
moon. It takes 105 hours and 
5 1 .8 minutes for the satellite to 
complete one of its orbits. Its 
purpose is to see — among other 
things — what magnetic fields are 
doing inside the orbit of the moon. 

It was launched on December 
5, 1968, and its working life is 
expected to be about one year. 
Afterwards it will continue orbit- 
ing for a long time. Its weight is 
238 lbs. 

The successful launch of this 
satellite made the Europeans feel 
a little better about a failure they 
had experienced only a week 
earlier. The ELDO (European 
Launcher Development Organiza- 
tion) has spent years developing 
a three-stage satellite launch vehi- 
cle, named Europa- 1. There had 
been a few failures but the rocket 



that was on the launch pad at 
the new French firing range in 
French Guiana promised t o 
behave. The first stage, a British 
Blue Streak, did function as plan- 
ned and so did the second stage, 
the French Coralie, which had 
given trouble in earlier flights. 
When the third stage, the German 
Astris, separated from the Coralie 
and ignited properly everybody 
was convinced that it would put 
the Italian-built satellite into orbit. 
But after seven seconds of firing 
the Astris cut off and both it 
and the satellite crashed 
somewhere. The researchers are 
not even sure where impact took 
place, because at the instant of 
engine cut-off all telemetry cut 
off, too, and the trackers lost the 
vehicle. 

Since then Canadian-American 
collaboration has put another 
Canadian satellite into orbit, on 
January 30, 1969. It is called 
ISTS, meaning International 
Satellite for Ionosphere Studies. 

European plans for the future 
are quite diversified. Hie French 
have stated that they are develop- 
ing a larger version of their Dia- 
mant satellite launcher. But even 
the larger Diamant will not be 
able to orbit the French Roseau 
satellite now under construction 
in Toulouse. During a Franco- 
Soviet Scientific Cooperation 
Conference, held in that French 
city in November 1968, it was

FRANK HERBERT 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



Dune was an arid planet, 
inhabited by gigantic sandworms 
and wild Frernen whose customs 
were based on water scarcity. Its 
only resource was melange, an 
addictive drug produced by the 
worms. This “spice” aided 
longevity and gave an adept 
visions of the future. 

' After the murder of his noble 



father, FALL AT RIDES was 
dumped into the desert, together 
with his pregnant mother, the 
LADY JESSICA, who had been 
trained by the Bene Gesserit — 
a female order devoted to mental 
arts and the control of genetic 
lines to produce a “kwisatz 
haderach”, a messiah capable of 
using psi powers. Paul was to 
be their instrument. 

hi learning to live with the Fre- 
rnen, Paul was forced to take an 




overdose of drug. This opened his 
mind permanently to the 
future — or futures. Lady Jessica 
also look an overdose with the 
result that ALIA, Paul's sister, 
was horn with full knowledge of 
all her mother had known. 

Paul, by then also known as 
MU AD' DIB , eventually led the 
I remen against the Harkonnen 
rulers and their Sardqukar 
soldiers. In the battle. Paul's old 
friend and teacher. DUNCAN 
IDAHO, was killed. As ruler, 
Paul took the Harkonnen heir. 
PRINCESS IRU LAN. as his con- 
sort — but refused to consummate 
the marriage, remaining true to 
the Piemen woman CHANI. 

Now, twelve years later, Paul 
has made the desert bloom and 
he rules a mighty empire of stars. 
He has become almost a god to 
the Qizarate, a cult built around 
his visions. Against it, the other 
(gutsi-political and quasi-religious, 
forces of humanity have just 
begun to unite. 

Among these is the Bene 
Cesserit, headed bv the Reverend 
Mother GAIUS HELEN 
MOIIIAM , working through the 
weak help of their trainee, 
Princess Irulan. More or less with 
them is the Bene Tleilax, sup- 
posedly amoral scientists; their 
representative is the Tleilaxu Pace 
Dancer SCYTALE, who can look 
like any man or woman. The two 
groups have the aid of the Spacing 
Guild, which must control the 
melange trade, since only spice 
visions make interstellar naviga- 
tion possible. Their Steersman 
EDRIC is more fishlike than hu- 



man and must live in a tank. 
His main function is to obscure 
Pant's visions with his own gift 
so their plotting will not be 
detected. 

They send Princess Irulan back 
to Paul to demand he give her 
an heir; she has so far kept Chani 
sterile by adding drugs to the Pre- 
men woman's food. Paul refuses. 
He is filled with bitter visions, 
unsure but what he is the very 
instrument of the future he tries 
to avoid. He is sure, however, 
that a royal heir by Irulan will 
destroy all hope. 

Paul detects the Reverend 
Mother on Ed rip’s ship and has 
her arrested. But Scvtale and BI- 
JAZ. a created Tleilaxu dwarf, 
escape. 

Scytale secretly visits a Premen 
quarter to gain information. He 
leaves Bijaz behind but takes with 
him the semuta-addicted daughter 
of OTHEYM. a bitter old desert 
fighter. Her name is LICHNA. 

During an interview with Edric, 
Paid learns nothing. The presence 
of the Steersman muddies all his 
future visions. It also upsets 
STILGAR, his minister of state, 
and KOREA, head of the 
Qizarate. Paul can only determine 
that the Reverend Mother has 
suggested that Princess Irulan 
have Chani killed, since Paul’s 
mate now refuses the food con- 
taining the sterility drug. 

Edric then makes Paul a 
shocking present — something that 
looks like Duncan Idaho, except 
for metallic eyes. It is a 
ghola — Duncan’s body has been 
regrown front its cell patterns by 

109 



DUNE MESSIAH 



Tleilaxu science. But it has no 
memories from its former life and 
is now named HA YT. Paul is 
disturbed by the fact that he saw 
no vision of Duncan's return. He 
asks the purpose of the gift, and 
Hayt answers : "I have been sent 
to destroy you.” But Hayt does 
not know how it will come about. 
He tells Paul to send him 
away — but Paul cannot, since 
Duncan was once so close to 
him. 

Alia is sent to study the body 
of a girl found in the desert. She 
can learn little, except that the 
corpse shows signs of sernuta- 
addiction, but she is sure it in- 
dicates some grave danger. On 
the way hack, Hayt reveals signs 
of being the real Duncan Idaho, 
and she is attracted to him in 
spite of herself. When he kisses 
her, she protests; but he tells her 
he only did what she wanted. 

On the verge of new struggles 
of empire, Paul finds nothing 
going well. There are reports of 
treason among the F re men and an 
attempt to steal a worm and 
develop melange on another 
world — one Pend cannot see,

A S HE LAY there deep immersed 
in the screaming odor of the 
spice, staring inward through the 
oracular trance, Paul saw the 
moon as it became an elongated 
sphere. It rolled and twisted, hiss- 
ing — the terrible hissing of a star 
being quenched in an infinite 
sea — like a ball thrown by a child. 
It was gone. 

This moon had not yet set. 
Realization engulfed him. It was 
gone: no moon. The earth quaked 
tike an animal shaking its skin. 
Terror swept over him. 

Paul jerked upright on his 
pallet, eyes wide open, staring. 
Part of him looked outward, part 
inward. Outwardly, he saw the 
plasmeld grillwork which vented 
iris private room, and he knew 
he lay beside a stonelike abyss 
of his Keep. Inwardly, he conti- 
nued to see the moon fall. 

Out! Out! 

His grillwork of plasmeld look- 
ed onto the blazing light of noon 
across Arrakeen. Inward— there 
lay blackest night. A shower of 
sweet odors from a garden roof 
nibbled at his senses, but no floral 
perfume could roll back that 
fallen moon. 

Paul swung his feet to the cold 
surface of the floor, and he peered 
through the grillwork. He could 
see directly across to the gentle 
arc of a footbridge constructed 
of crystal-stabilized gold and pla- 
tinum. Fire jewels from far Cedon 
decorated the bridge. It led to 
the galleries of the inner city 
across a pool and fountain filled 
with waterflowers. If he stood, 
Paul knew, he could look down 

GALAXY 



into petals as clean and red as 
fresh blood whirling, turning 
there — discs of ambient color 
tossed on an emerald freshet. 

His eyes absorbed the scene 
without pulling him from spice 
thralldom. 

That terrible vision of a lost 
moon. 

The vision suggested to him a 
monstrous loss of individual 
security. Perhaps he’d seen his 
civilization fall, toppled by its own 
pretensions. 

A moon ... a moon ... a 
falling moon. 

It had taken a massive dose 
of the spice essence to penetrate 
the mud thrown up by the tarot. 
All it had shown him was a falling 
moon and the hateful way he'd 
known from the beginning. To 
buy an end for the Jihad, to 
silence the volcano of butchery, 
lie must discredit himself. 

Disengage . disengage , . 
disengage . 

Floral perfume from the garden 
roof reminded him of Chani. He 
longed for her arms now, for the 
clinging arms of love and forget- 
fulness. But even Chani could not 
exorcise this vision. What would 
Chani say if he went to her with 
the statement that he had a par- 
ticular death in mind? Knowing 
it to be inevitable, why not choose 
an aristocrat’s death, ending life 
on a secret flourish, squandering 
any years that might have been? 
To die before coming to the end 
of willpower, was that not an 
aristocrat’s choice? 

H E STOOD, crossed to the lapped 
opening in the grillwork and 

DUNE MESSIAH 



went out onto a balcony which 
looked upward to flowers and 
vines trailing from the garden. His 
mouth held the dryness of a desert 
march. 

Moon . moon — where is 
that moon? 

He thought of Alia’s descrip- 
tion, the young woman’s body 
found in the dunes. A Fremen ad- 
dicted to semuta! Everything fitted 
the hateful pattern. 

You do not lake from this 
universe, he thought. It grants 
what it will. 

The remains of a conch shell 
from the seas of Mother Earth 
lay on a low table beside the 
balcony rail. He took its lustrous 
smoothness into his hands, tried 
to feel backward in Time. The 
pearl surface reflected glittering 
moons of light. He tore his gaze 
from it and peered upward past 
the garden to a sky become a 
conflagration — trails of rainbow 
dust shining in the silver sun. 

My Fremen call themselves 
‘Children of the Moon . .’ 

He put down the conch, strode 
along the balcony. Did that terri- 
fying moon hold out hope of 
escape? 

He probed for meaning in the 
region of mystic communion. He 
felt weak, shaken, still gripped by 
the spice. 

At the north end of his 
plasmeld chasm, he came in sight 
of the lower buildings of the 
government warren. Foot traffic 
thronged the roof walks. He felt 
that the people moved there like 
a frieze against a background of 
doors, walls and tile designs. The 

III 



people were tiles! When he blink- 
ed, lie could hold them frozen 
in his mind. A frieze. 

A moon falls and is gone. 

A feeling came over him that 
the city out there had been 
translated into an odd symbol for 
his universe. The buildings he 
could see had been erected on 
the plain where his Frcmen had 
obliterated the Sardaukar legions. 
Ground once trampled by battles 
rang now to the rushing clamor 
of business. 

Keeping to the balcony's outer 
edge, Paul strode around the cor- 
ner. Now, his vista was a suburb 
where all the city structures lost 
themselves in rocks and the blow- 
ing sand of the desert. Alia’s 
temple dominated the foreground; 
green and black hangings along 
its two-thousand-meter sides dis- 
played the rising moon symbol of 
Muad’dib. 

A falling moon. 

Paul passed a hand across his 
forehead and eyes. The symbol- 
metropolis oppressed him. He 
despised his own thoughts. Such 
vacillation in another would have 
aroused his anger. 

He loathed his city! 

Rage firmly rooted in boredom 
flickered and simmered deep 
within him, nurtured by decisions 
that couldn’t be avoided. He knew 
which path his feet must follow. 
He’d seen it enough times, hadn’t 
he? Seen it! Once . long ago 
he’d thought of himself as an in- 
ventor of government. But the in- 
vention had fallen into old pat- 
terns. It was like some hideous 
contrivance with plastic memory. 

112 



Shape it any way you wanted, 
but relax for a moment, and it 
snapped into the ancient forms. 
Forces at work beyond his reach 
in human breasts eluded and de- 
fied him. 

P AUL STARED out across the 
rooftops. What treasures of un- 
trammeled life lay beneath those 
roofs? He glimpsed leaf-green 
places, open plantings amidst the 
chalk-red and gold of the roofs. 
Green, the gift of Muad’dib and 
his water. Orchards and groves lay 
within his view — -open plantings 
to rival those of fabled Lebanon. 

“Muad’dib spends water like a 
madman,” Fremen said. 

Paul covered his eyes. 

The moon fell. 

He dropped his hands, stared 
at his metropolis with clarified 
vision. Buildings took on an aura 
of monstrous imperial barbarity. 
They stood enormous and bright 
beneath the northern sun. Colossi! 
Every extravagance of architec- 
ture a demented history could 
produce lay within his view: ter- 
races of mesa proportion, squares 
as large as some cities, parks, 
premises, small bits of cultured 
wilderness. 

Superb artistry abutted inex- 
plicable prodigies of d i s m a I 
tastelessness. Details impressed 
themselves upon him: a postern 
out of most ancient Bagdhad ... a 
dome that was dreamed in fabled 
Damascus . .an arch from tire 
effect of unrivaled magnificence. 
A moon! A moon! A moonL. 
Frustration tangled him. He felt 
the pressure of mass-unconscious, 

GALAXY 



Iliat burgeoning sweep of hu- 
mankind across his universe. They 
rushed upon him with a force 
like a gigantic tidal bore. He 
sensed the vast migrations at work 
in human affairs: eddies, currents, 
gene flows. No dams of absti- 
nence, no seizures of impotence 
nor maledictions could stop it. 

Muad’dib's Jihad was less than 
an eye blink in this larger move- 
ment. The Bene Gesserit swim- 
ming in this tide, that corporate 
entity trading in genes, was trap- 
ped in the torrent as he was. 
Visions of a falling moon must 
be measured against many other 
legends, other visions found in a 
universe where even the seemingly 
eternal stars waned, flickered, 
died . 

What mattered a single moon 
in such a universe? 

Far within his fortress citadel, 
so deep within that the sound 
sometimes lost itself in the flow 
of city noises, a ten-string rebaba 
tinkled with a song of the Jihad, 
a lament for a woman left behind 
on Arrakis — 

“Her hips are dimes curved by 
the wind, 

Her eyes shine like summer heat. 

I wo braids of hair hang down 
her back — 

Rich with water rings, her hair! 
My hands remember her skin. 
Fragrant as amber, flower- 
scented. 

Eyelids tremble with 
memories . 

I am stricken by love’s white 
flame!” 



The song sickened him. A tune 
for stupid creatures lost in senti- . 
mentality! As well sing to the 
dune-impregnated corpse Alia had 
seen. 

A FIGURE moved in shadows of 
the balcony’s grillwork. Paul 
whirled. 

The ghola emerged into the 
sun’s full glare. His metal eyes 
glittered. 

“Is it Duncan Idaho or the man 
called Hayt?” Paul asked. 

The ghola came to a stop two 
paces from him. “Which would 
my Lord prefer?” 

The voice carried a soft ring of 
caution. 

“Play the Zensunni,” Paul said 
bitterly. Meanings within mean- 
ings! What could a Zensunni 
philosopher say or do to change 
one jot of the reality unrolling 
before them at this instant? 

“My Lord is troubled.” 

Paul turned away, stared at the 
Shield Wall’s distant scrap, saw 
wind-carved arches and but- 
tresses, terrible mimicry of his 
city. Nature playing a joke on 
him! See what / can build! He 
recognized a slash in the distant 
massif, a place where sand spilled 
from a crevasse, and thought: 
There! Right there, we fought 
Sardaukar! 

“What troubles my Lord?” the 
ghola asked. 

“A vision,” Paul whispered. 
“Ahhhhh, when the Tleilaxu 
first awakened me, I had visions. 

I was restless, lonely . not really 
knowing T was lonely. Not then. 
My visions revealed nothing! The 

113 



DUNE MESSIAH 



Tleilaxu told me it was an in- 
trusion of the flesh which men 
and gholas all suffer, a sickness, 
no more.” 

Paul turned, studied the ghola’s 
eyes, those pitted, steely balls 
without expression. What visions 
did those eyes see? 

“Duncan . Duncan . .” Paul 
whispered. 

“I am called Hayt.” 

“I saw a moon fall,” Paul said. 
“It was gone, destroyed. I heard 
a great hissing. The earth shook.” 
“You are drunk on too much 
time,” the ghola said. 

“I ask for the Zensunni and 
get the mentat!” Paul said. “Very 
well! Play my vision through your 
logic, mentat. Analyze it and 
reduce it to mere words laid out 
for burial.” 

“Burial, indeed,” the ghola 
said. “You run from death. You 
strain at the next instant, refuse 
to live here and now. Augury! 
What a crutch for an Emperor!” 
Paul found himself fascinated 
by a well-remembered mole on 
the ghola’s chin. 

“Trying to live in this future,” 
the ghola said, “do you give 
substance to such a future? Do 
you make it real?” 

“If I go the way of my vision- 
future, I’ll be alive then,” Paul 
muttered. “What makes you think 
I want to live there?” 

The ghola shrugged. “You ask- 
ed me for a substantial answer.” 
“Where is there substance in 
a universe composed of events?” 
Paul asked. “Is there a final 
answer? Doesn’t each solution 
produce new questions?” 

1 14 



“You've digested so much time 
you have delusions of im- 
mortality,” the ghola said. “Even 
your Empire, my Lord, must live 
its time and die.” 

“Don’t start to parade smoke- 
blackened altars before me,” Paul 
growled. “I’ve heard enough sad 
histories of gods and messiahs. 
Why should 1 need special powers 
to forecast ruins of my own like 
all those others? The lowliest ser- 
vant of my kitchens could do 
this.” He shook his head. “The 
moon fell!” 

“You’ve not brought your mind 
to rest at its beginning.” 

“Is that how you destroy me?” 
Paul demanded. “Prevent me from 
collecting my thoughts?” 

“Can you collect chaos?” the 
ghola asked. “We Zensunni say: 
‘Not collecting, that is the ultimate 
gathering.’ What can you gather 
without gathering yourself?” 

“I’m deviled by a vision and 
you spew nonsense!” Paul raged. 
“What do you know of prescien- 
ce?” 

“I’ve seen the oracle at work,” 
the ghola said. 1 Tve seen those 
who seek signs and omens for 
their individual destiny. They fear 
what they seek.” 

“My falling moon is real,” Paul 
whispered. He took a trembling 
breath. “It moves. It moves.” 
“Men always fear things which 
move by themselves,” the ghola 
said. “You fear your own powers. 
Things fall into your head from 
nowhere. When they fall out, 
where do they go?” 

“You comfort me with thorns,” 
Paul growled. 



GALAXY 



An inner illumination came 
over i lie ghola’s face. For a mo- 
ment, lie became pure Duncan 
Mnlio, a storehouse of relic 
memories. “I give you what com- 
lort | can,” lie said. 

Paul wondered at that momen- 
tary spasm. Had the ghola felt 
.met which his mind rejected? 
Il ul llavt put down a vision of 
Ins own? 

“My moon has a name,” Paul 
vv hispcrcd. 

Me let the vision flow over him 
then. Though his whole being 
shrieked, no sound escaped him. 
Me was afraid to speak, fearful 
licit liis voice might betray him. 
I lie air of this terrifying future 
was thick with Chani’s absence. 
Mesh that had cried in ecstasy, 
eyes that had burned him with 
their desire, the voice that had 
charmed him because it played 
no tricks of subtle control — all 
gone, back into the water and 
the sand. 

Slowly, Paul turned away and 
looked out at the present and the 
plaza before Alia’s temple. Three 
shaven-headed pilgrims entered 
from the processional avenue. 
I hey wore Grimy yellow robes and 
hurried with their heads bent 
against the afternoon's wind. One 
walked with a limp, dragging his 
left foot. They beat their way 
against the wind, rounded a cor- 
ner and were gone from his sight. 

.lust as his moon would go, 
they were gone. Still, his vision 
lay before him. Its terrible pur- 
pose gave him no choice. 

The flesh surrenders itself, he 
thought. Eternity takes back its

waters briefly, danced with a cer-

Beg not the sun for mercy. 

— Maud’dib’s Travail 
From the Stilgar Commentary 

O NE moment of incompetence 
can be fatal, the Reverend 
Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam re- 
minded herself. 

She hobbled along, apparently 
unconcerned, within a ring of 
Fremen guards. One of those 
behind her, she knew, was a deaf 
mute immune to any wiles of 
voice. No doubt he had been 
charged to kill her at the slightest 
provocation. 

Why had Paul summoned her? 
Was he about to pass sentence? 
She remembered the day long ago 
when she’d tested him. .the child 
Kwisatz Haderach. He was a deep 
one. 

Damn his mother for all eter- 
nity! It was her fault the Bene 
Gesserit had lost their hold on 
this gene line. 

Silence surged along the vaulted 
passages ahead of her entourage. 
She sensed the word being passed. 
Paul would hear the silence. He’d 
know of her coming before it was 
announced. She didn’t delude 
herself with ideas that her powers 
exceeded his. 

115 



Damn him! 

She begrudged the burdens age 
had imposed on her — the aching 
joints, responses not as quick as 
once they’d been, muscles not as 
elastic as the whipchords of her 
youth. A long day lay behind her 
and a long life. She’d spent this 
day with the Dune Tarot in a 
fruitless search for some clue to 
her own fate. But the cards were 
sluggish. 

The guards herded her around 
a corner into another of the 
silent, seemingly endless vaulted 
passages. Triangular metaglass 
windows on her left gave a view 
upward to trellised vines and in- 
digo flowers in deep shadows cast 
by the afternoon sun. Tiles lay 
underfoot — figures of water 
creatures from exotic planets. 

Robed figures passed across 
another ball in front of her, cast- 
ing covert glances at the Reverend 
Mother. Recognition was obvious 
in their manner — and tension. 

She kept her attention on the 
sharp hairline of the guard imme- 
diately in front — young flesh, pink 
creases at the uniform collar. 

Now an open doorway from 
which emerged the sound of tim- 
brel and flute playing soft, elder 
music. A glance showed her blue- 
in-blue Fremen eyes staring from 
the room. She sensed in them the 
ferment of legendary revolts stir- 
ring in wild genes. 

There lay the measure of her 
personal burden, she knew. A 
Bene Gesserit could not escape 
awareness of the genes and their 
possibilities. She was touched by 
a feeling of loss: that stubborn 

116 



fool of an Atreides! How could 
he deny the jewels of posterity 
within his Joins? A Kwisatz 
Haderach! Born out of his time, 
true, but real — as real as his 
abomination of a sister. .and 
there lay a dangerous unknown. 
A wild Reverend Mother spawned 
without Bene Gesserit inhibitions, 
holding no loyalty to orderly 
development of the genes. She 
shared her brother’s powers, no 
doubt — and more. 

T HE size of the citadel began to 
oppress her. Would the pas- 
sages never end? The place reeked 
of terrifying physical power. No 
planet, no civilization in all hu- 
man history had ever before seen 
such man-made immensity. A 
dozen ancient cities could be hid- 
den within its walls! 

They passed oval doors with 
winking lights. She recognized 
them for Ixian handiwork: 
pneumatic transport orifices. Why 
was she being marched all this 
distance, then? The answer began 
to shape itself in her mind— to 
oppress her in preparation for this 
audience with the Emperor. 

A small clue, but it joined other 
subtle indications— the relative 
suppression and selection of 
words by her escort, the traces 
of primitive shyness in their eyes 
when they called her Reverend 
Mother, the cold and bland, 
essentially odorless nature of these 
halls — all combined to reveal 
much that a Bene Gesserit could 
interpret. 

Paul wanted something from 
her! 



GALAXY 



She concealed a feeling of ela- 
tion, A bargaining lever existed. 
It remained only to find the nature 
of that lever and test its strength. 
Some lovers had moved things 
greater than this citadel. A finger’s 
touch had been known to topple 
civilizations. 

The Reverend Mother reminded 
herself then of Scytale’s assess- 
ment: When a creature has 
developed into one thing, he will 
choose death rather than change 
into his opposite. 

The passages through which she 
was being escorted grew larger 
by subtle stages — tricks of 
arching, graduated amplification 
of pillared supports, displacement 
of the triangular windows by 
larger, oblong shapes. Ahead of 
her, finally, loomed double doors 
centered in the far wall of a tall 
antechamber. She sensed that the 
doors were very large, and was 
forced to suppress a gasp as her 
trained awareness measured out 
the true proportions. The doorway 
stood at least eighty meters high, 
half that in width. 

As she approached with her 
escort, the doors swung in- 
ward — un immense and silent 
movement of hidden machinery. 
She recognized more Ixian handi- 
work. Through that towering 
doorway she marched with her 
guards into the Grand Reception 
Hail of the Emperor Paul Atreides 
— “Muad’dib, before whom all 
people are dwarfed.” 

As she advanced toward Paul 
on the distant throne, the 
Reverend Mother found herself 
more impressed by the architec- 

DUNE MESSIAH 



tural subtleties of her surround- 
ings than she was by the im- 
mensities. The space was large; 
it could have housed the entire 
citadel of any ruler in human 
history. The open sweep of the 
room said much about hidden 
beams behind these walls and the 
far away domed ceiling must sur- 
pass anything ever before at- 
tempted. Everything spoke of 
engineering genius. 

Without seeming to do so, the 
hall grew smaller at its far end, 
refusing to dwarf Paul on his 
throne centered on a dais. An 
untrained awareness, shocked by 
surrounding proportions, would 
see him at first as many times 
larger than his actual size. Colors 
played upon the unprotected 
psyche; Paul’s green throne had 
been cut from a single Hagar 
emerald. It suggested growing 
things and, out of the Fremen 
mythos, reflected the mourning 
color. It whispered that here sat 
the one who could make you 
mourn — life and death in one 
symbol, a clever stress of op- 
posites. Behind the throne, 
draperies cascaded in burnt 
orange, curried gold of Dune 
earth, and cinnamon flecks of 
melange. To a trained eye, the 
symbolism was obvious, but it 
contained hammer blows to beat 
down the uninitiated. 

Time played its role here. 

T HE Reverend Mother measured 
the minutes required to ap- 
proach the Imperial Presence at 
her hobbling pace. You bad time 
to be cowed. Any tendency 

117 



toward resentment would be 
squeezed out of you by the un- 
bridled power which focused 
down upon your person. You 
might start the long march towardv 
that throne as a human of dignity, 
but you ended the march as a 
gnat. 

Aides and attendants stood 
around the Emperor in a curiously 
ordered sequence — attentive 

household guardsmen along the 
draped back wall; that abomina- 
tion, Alia, two steps below Paul 
and on his left hand; Stilgar, the 
Imperial lackey, on the step 
directly below Alia; and on the 
right, one step up from the floor 
of the hall, a solitary figure, the 
fleshly revenant of Duncan Idaho, 
the ghola. She marked older Fre- 
men among the guardsmen, 
bearded Naibs with stillsuit scars 
on their noses, sheathed 
crysknives at their waists, a few 
maula pistols, even some lasguns. 
Those must be trusted men, she 
thought, to carry lasguns in Paul’s 
presence when he obviously wore 
a shield generator. She could see 
the shimmering of its field around 
him. One burst of a lasgun into 
that field and the entire citadel 
would be a hole in the ground. 

Her guard stopped ten paces 
from the foot of the dais and 
parted to open an unobstructed 
view of the Emperor. She noted 
now the absence of Chani and 
Irulan, and wondered at it. He 
held no important audience 
without them, so it was said. 

Paul nodded to her, silent, 
measuring. 

Immediately, she decided to 

1 18 



take the offensive. She said: “So, 
the great Paul Atreides deigns to 
see the one he banished.” 

Paul smiled wryly, thinking: 
She knows l want something from 
her. That knowledge had been 
inevitable, she being who she was. 
He recognized her powers. The 
Bene Gesserit didn’t become 
Reverend Mothers by chance. 

“Shall we dispense with fenc- 
ing?” he asked. 

And she said: “Name the 

thing you want.” 

Stilgar stirred, casting a sharp 
glance at Paul. The Imperial 
lackey didn’t like her tone. 

“Stilgar wants me to send you 
away,” Paul said. 

“Not kill me?” she asked. “I 
would have expected something 
more direct from a Freman Naib.” 

Stilgar scowled and said: “Of- 
ten, I must speak otherwise than 
I think. That is called diplomacy.” 

“Then let us dispense with 
diplomacy, as well,” she said. 
“Was it necessary to have me 
walk all that distance? I am an 
old woman.” 

“You had to be shown how 
callous I can be,” Paul said. 
“That way, you’ll appreciate 
magnanimity.” 

“You dare such gaucheries with 
a Bene Gesserit?” she asked. 

“Gross actions carry their own 
messages,” Paul said. 

She hesitated, weighing his 
words. So — he might yet dispense 
with her. .grossly, obviously, if 
she. .if she what? 

“Say what it is you want from 
me,” she muttered. 

“You must be careful how you 

GALAXY 



speak to me, old woman,” Paul 
said. 

H E CALLED me that when he 
was a stripling, the Reverend 
Mother thought. Does he remind 
me now of my hand in his past? 
The decision / made then, must 
1 remake it here? She felt the 
weight of decision, a physical 
thing that set her knees to 
trembling. Muscles cried their 
fatigue. 

“It was a long walk,” Paul said, 
“and I can see that you’re tired. 
We will retire to my private 
chamber behind the throne. You 
may sit there.” He gave a hand 
signal to Stilgar and arose. 

Stilgar and the ghola converged 
on her; they helped her up the 
steps and followed Paul through 
a passage concealed by the 
draperies. She realized then why 
he had greeted her in the hall — a 
dumb show for the guards and 
Naibs. He feared them, then. And 
now — now, he displayed kindly 
benevolence, daring such wiles on 
a Bene Gesserit. Or was it daring? 
She sensed another presence 
behind and glanced back to see 
Alia following. The younger wom- 
an’s eyes held a brooding bale- 
ful cast. 

The private chamber at the end 
of the passage' was a twenty-meter 
cube of plasmeld, with yellow 
glowglobes for light and the deep 
orange hangings of a desert still- 
tent around the walls. It contained 
divans, soft cushions, a faint odor 
of melange, crystal water flagons 
on a low table. It felt cramped, 
tiny after the outer hall. 

DUNE MESSIAH 



Paul seated her on a divan and 
stood over her, studying the an- 
cient face — steely teeth, eyes that 
hid more than they revealed, 
deeply wrinkled skin. He indicated 
a water flagon. She shook her 
head, dislodging a wisp of gray 
hair. 

In a low voice, Paul said: “I 
wish to bargain with you for the 
life of my beloved.” 

Stilgar cleared his throat. 

Alia fingered the handle of the 
crysknife sheathed at her neck. 

The ghola remained at the 
door, face impassive, metal eyes 
pointed at the air above the 
Reverend Mother’s head. 

“Have you had a vision of my 
hand in her death?” the Reverend 
Mother asked. She kept her atten- 
tion on the ghola, oddly disturbed 
by him. Why should she feel 
threatened by the ghola? He was 
a tool of the conspiracy. 

“I know what it is you want 
from me,” Paul said, avoiding her 
question. 

T hen he only suspects, she 
thought. The Reverend Mother 
looked down at the tips of her 
shoes exposed by a fold of her 
robe. Black. .black. .shoes and 
robe showed marks of her con- 
finement: stains, wrinkles. She 

lifted her chin and met an angry 
glare in Paul’s eyes. Elation surged 
through her, but she hid the 
emotion behind slitted eyelids. 

“What coin do you offer?” she 
asked. 

“You may have my seed, but 
not my person,” Paul said. “Irulan 
banished and inseminated by ar- 
tificial. .” 

119 



- “You dare!” the Reverend 
Mother flared, stiffening. 

Stilgar took a half step forward. 



D isconcertingly, the ghoia 

smiled. And now. Alia was 
studying him. 

“We'll not discuss the things 
your Sisterhood forbids,” Paul 
said. “I will listen to no talk of 
sins, abominations or the beliefs 
left over from past Jihads. You 
may have my seed for your plans, 
but no child of irulan’s will sit 
on my throne.” 

“Your throne,” she sneered. 
“My throne.” 

“Then who will bear the Im- 
perial heir?” 

“Chani.” 

“She is barren.” 

“She is with child.” 

An involuntary indrawn breath 
exposed her shock. “You lie!” she 
snapped. 

Paul held up a restraining hand 
as Stilgar surged forward, 

“We’ve known for two days 
that she carries my child.” 

“But Irulan. 

“By artificial means only. 
That’s my offer.” 

The Reverend Mother closed 
her eyes to hide his face. Damna- 
tion! To cast the genetic dice in 
such a way! Loathing boiled in 
her breast. The teachings of the 
Bene Gesserit. the lessons of the 
Butlerian Jihad — all proscribed 
such an act. One did not demean 
the highest aspirations of hu- 
mankind. No .machine could 
function in the way of a human 
mind. No word or deed could 

120 



imply that men might be bred 
on. the level of animals. 

She shook her head. The genes, 
the precious Atreides genes— only 
these were important. Need went 
deeper than proscription. For the 
Sisterhood, mating mingled more 
than sperm and ovum. One aimed 
to capture the psyche. 

The Reverend Mother under- 
stood now the subtle depths of 
Paul’s offer. He would make the 
Bene Gesserit party to an act 
which would bring down popular, 
wrath. .were it ever discovered. 
They could not admit such pater- 
nity if the Emperor denied it. This 
coin might save the Atreides genes 
for the Sisterhood, but it would 
never buy a throne. 

She swept her gaze around the 
room, studying each face: Stilgar, 
passive and waiting now; the 
ghoia frozen at some inward 
place; Alia watching the 
ghoia. .and Paul — wrath beneath 
a shallow veneer. 

“This is your only offer?” she 
asked. 

“My only offer.” 

She glanced at the ghoia, caught 
by a brief movement of muscles 
across his checks. Emotion? 
“You, ghoia,” she said. “Should 
such an offer be made? Having 
been made, should it be accepted? 
Function as the mentat for us.” 

The metallic eyes turned to 
Paul. 

“Answer as you will,” Paul 
said. 

The ghoia returned his gleam- 
ing attention to the Reverend 
Mother, shocking her once more 
by smiling. “An offer is only as 

GALAXY 



good as the real thing it buys,” 
lie said. “The exchange offered 
here is life-for-life, a high order 
of business.” 

Alia brushed a strand of cop- 
pery hair from her forehead. She 
said: “And what else is hidden 
in this bargain?” 

The Reverend Mother refused 
to look at Alia, but the words 
burned in her mind. Yes, far 
deeper implications lay here. The 
sister was an abomination, true, 
but there could be no denying 
her status as a Reverend Mother 
with all the title impled. Gains 
Helen Mohiam felt herself in this 
instant to be not one single 
person, but all the others who 
sat like tiny congeries in her 
memory. They were alert, every 
Reverend Mother she had 
absorbed in becoming a Priestess 
of the Sisterhood. Alia would be 
standing in the same situation 
here. 

“What else?” the ghola asked. 
“One wonders why the witches 
of the Bene Gesscrit have not 
used Tleilaxu methods.” 

G AHJS HELEN MOHIAM and 
all the Reverend Mothers with- 
in her shuddered. Yes, the 
Tleilaxu did loathsome things. If. 
one let down the barriers to artifi- 
cial insemination, was the next 
step a Tleilaxu one — controlled 
mutation? 

Paul, observing the play of 
emotion around him, felt abruptly 
that he no longer knew these peo- 
ple. He could see only strangers. 
Even Alia was a stranger. 

Alia said: “If we set the 



Atreides genes adrift in a Bene 
Gesscrit river, who knows what 
may result?” 

Gains Helen Molviam’s head 
snapped around, and she met 
Alia’s gaze. For a flashing instant, 
they were two Reverend Mothers 
together, communing on a single 
thought: What lay behind any 

Tleilaxu action? The ghola was 
a Tleilaxu thing. Had he put this 
plan into Paul's mind? Would 
Paul attempt to bargain directly 
with the Bene Tleilax? 

She broke her gaze front Alia's, 
feeling her own ambivalence and 
inadequacies. The pitfall of Bene 
Gesserit training, she reminded 
herself, lay in the powers granted; 
such powers predisposed one to 
vanity and pride. But power 
deluded those who used it. One 
tended to believe power could 
overcome any barrier. .including 
one’s own ignorance. 

Only one thing stood para- 
mount here for the Bene Gesserit, 
she told herself. That was the 
pyramid of generations which had 
reached an apex in Paul 
Atreides. .and in his abomination 
of a sister. A wrong choice here 
and the pyramid would have to 
be rebuilt. .starting generations 
back in the parallel lines and with 
breeding specimens lacking the 
choicest characteristics. 

Controlled mutation, s h e 
thought. Did the Tleilaxu really 
practice it? How tempting ! She 
shook her head, the better to rid 
it of such thoughts. 

“You reject my proposal?” Paul 
asked. 

“I'm thinking,” she said. s 



DUNE MESSIAH 



m 



And again, she looked at the 
sister. The optimum cross for this 
female Alreides had been 
lost. .killed by Paul. Another 
possibility still remained, how- 
ever — one which would cement 
the desired characteristic in- 
to an offspring. Paul dared offer 
animat breeding to the Bene 
Gesserit! How much was he really 
prepared to pay for his Chani’s 
life? Would lie accept a cross with 
his own sister? 

Sparring for time, the Reverend 
Mother said: “Tell me, oh, 

flawless exemplar of all that’s 
holy, has Irulan anything to say 
of your proposal?” 

“Irulan will do what you tell 
her to do,” Paul growled. True 
enough, Mohiam thought. She 
firmed her jaw, offered a new 
gambit: “There are two Atreides.” 

Paul, sensing something of what 
lay in the old witch’s mind, felt 
blood darken his face. “Careful 
what you suggest,” he said. 

“You’d just use Irulan to gain 
your own ends, eh?" she asked. 

“Wasn't she trained to be 
used?” Paul asked. 

And we trained her, that's what 
he’s saying, Mohiam thought. 
Well. .Indent's a divided coin. 
Was there another way to spend 
such a coin? 

i “Will you put Chani’s child on 
the throne?” the Reverend Mother 
asked. 

“On my throne,” Paul said. He 
glanced at Alia, wondering sud- 
denly if she knew the divergent 
possibilities in this exchange. Alia 
stood with eyes closed, an odd 
stillness-of-person about her. With 

122 



what inner force did she com- 
mune? Seeing his sister thus, Paul 
felt he’d been cast adrift. Alia 
stood on a shore that was receding 
from him. 

T HE Reverend Mother made her 
decision, she said: “This is too 
much for one person to decide. 
I must consult with my Council 
on Wallach. Will you permit a 
message?” 

As though she needed my per- 
mission! Paul thought. 

He said: “Agreed, then. But 
don’t delay too long. I will not 
sit idly by while you debate.” 

"Will you bargain with the Bene 
Tleilax?” the ^hola asked, his 
voice a sharp intrusion. 

Alia’s eyes popped open and 
she stared at the ghola as though 
she'd been wakened by a 
dangerous intruder. 

“I’ve made no such decision,” 
Paul said. “What I will do is 
go into the desert as soon as it 
can be arranged. Our child will 
be born in sietch." 

“A wise decision,” Stilgar in- 
toned. 

Alia refused to look at Stilgar. 
It was a wrong decision. She could 
feel this in every cell. Paul must 
know it. Why had he fixed himself 
upon such a path? 

“Have the Bene Tleilax offered 
their services?" Alia asked. She 
saw Mohiam hanging on the 
answer. 

Paul shook his head. “No.” He 
glanced at Stilgar. “Stil. arrange 
for the message to be sent to 
Wallach.” 

Paul turned away, waiting while 

GALAXY 



Stilgar summoned guards, left 
with the old witch. He sensed 
Alia debating whether to confront 
him witli more questions. She 
turned, instead, to the ghola. 

“Mentat,” she said, “will the 
Tleilaxu bid for favor with my 
brother?” 

The ghola shrugged. 

Paul felt his attention wander. 
The Tleilaxu? No. .not in the 
way Alia meant. Her question re- 
vealed, though, that she had not 
seen the alternatives here. 
Well. .vision varied from sybil to 
sybil. Why not a variance from 
brother to sister? Wander- 
ing. .wandering. He came back 
from each thought with a start 
to pick up shards of the nearby 
conversation. 

“. .must know what the 
Tleilaxu. .” 

“. .the fullness of data is al- 
ways. .” 

. .healthy doubts where. .” 

Paul turned, looked at this 
sister and caught her attention. 
He knew she would sec tears on 
his face and wonder at them. Let 
her wonder. Wondering was a 
kindness now. He glanced at the 
ghola, seeing only Duncan Idaho 
despite the metallic eyes. Sorrow 
and compassion warred in Paul. 
What might those metal eyes 
record? 

There are many degrees of sight 
and many degrees of blindness, 
Paul thought. His mind turned 
to a paraphrase of the passage 
from the Orange Catholic Bible: 
What senses do we lack that we

around us? 



Were those metal eyes another 
sense than sight? 

Alia crossed to her brother, 
sensing his utter sadness. She 
touched a tear on his check with 
a Fremen gesture of awe. "We 
must not grieve for those dear 
to us before their passing.” 

“Before their passing,” Paul 
whispered. “Tell me, little sister, 
what is before?”

and priest business ! You think I 
don't see my own mythos? Con- 
sult your data once more, Hayt. 
I've insinuated my rites into the 
most elementary human acts. The 
people eat in the name of 
Maud'dib! They make love in my 

name, are born in my name

blessing of Maud’dib!

OU risk much leaving your

at this time,” Edric said, glaring 
through the walls of his tank at 
the Face Dancer. 

“How weak and narrow is your 
thinking,” Scytale said. “Who is 
it who comes to visit you?” 

Edric hesitated, observing the 
hulk shape, heavy eyelids, blunt 
face. It was early in the day and 
Edric’s metabolism had not yet 
cycled from night repose into full 
melange consumption.

“This is nut the shape which 
walked the streets?” Edric asked. 

“One would not look twice at 
some of the figures 1 have been 
today,” Scytale said. 

The chameleon thinks a change 
of shape will hide him from 
anything, Edric thought with rare 
insight. And he wondered if his 
presence in the conspiracy truly 
hid them from ail oracular 
powers. The Emperor’s sister, 
now. 

Edric shook his head, stirring 
the orange gas of his tank. He 
said: “Why are you here?” 

“The gift must be prodded to 
swifter action,” Scytale said. 

“That cannot be done.” 

“A way must be found,” 
Scytale insisted. 

“Why?” 

“Things are not to my liking. 
The Emperor is trying to split 
us. Already he has made his bid 
to the Bene Gesserit.” 

“Oh, that. ” 

“That! You must prod the 
ghola to. 

“You fashioned him. Tleilaxu,” 
Edric said. “You know better than 
to ask this.” He paused, moving 
closer to the transparent wall of 
his tank. “Or did you lie to us 
about this gift?” 

“Lie?” 

“You said the weapon was to 
be aimed and released, nothing 
more. Once the ghola was given 
we could not tamper.” 

“Any ghola can be disturbed,” 
Scytale said. “You need do 
nothing more than question him 
about his original being.” 

“What will this do?” 

124 - 



“It will stir him to actions 
which will serve our purposes.” 
“He is a mentat with powers 
of logic and reason,” Edric ob- 
jected. “He may guess what I’m 
doing. .or the sister. If her atten- 
tion is focused upon. .” 

“Do you hide us from the sibyl 
or don’t you?” Scytale asked. 

“I’m not afraid of oracles,” 
Edric said. “I'm concerned with 
logic, with real spies, with the 
physical powers of the Imperiurn, 
with control of the spice, with. .” 
“One can contemplate the Em- 
peror and his powers comfortably 
if one remembers that all things 
arc finite,” Scytale said. 

O DDLY, the Steersman recoiled 
in agitation, threshing his limbs 
like some weird newt. Scytale 
fought a sense of loathing at the 
sight. The Guild Navigator wore 
his usual dark leotard, bulging at 
the belt with various containers. 
Yet. .lie gave the impression of 
nakedness when he moved. It was 
the swimming, reaching move- 
ments, Scytale decided, and lie 
was struck once more by the 
delicate linkages of their con- 
spiracy. They were not a com- 
patible group. That was weakness. 

Edric’s agitation subsided. He 
stared out at Scytale, vision col- 
ored by the orange gas which sus- 
tained him. What plot did the 
Face Dancer hold in reserve to 
save himself? The Tleilaxu was 
not acting in a predictable fashion. 
Evil omen. 

Something in the Navigator’s 
voice and actions told Scytale that 
the Guiklsman feared the sister 

GALAXY 



more than the Emperor. This was 
an abrupt thought flashed on the 
screen of awareness. Disturbing. 
Had they overlooked something 
important about Alia? Would the 
ghola be sufficient weapon to 
destroy both? 

“You know what is said of 
Alia?” Scytale asked, probing. 

“What do you mean?” Again, 
the fish-man was agitated. “Never 
have culture and beauty had 
such a patroness,” Scytale said. 

“What is enduring about cul- 
ture, beauty?” Edric demanded. 
“We will destroy both Atreides. 
Culture! They dispense culture 
the better to rule. Beauty! They 
promote the beauty which 
enslaves. They create a literate 
ignorance — easiest thing of all. 
They leave nothing to chance. 
Chains! Everything they do forges 
chains, enslaves. But slaves al- 
ways revolt.” 

“The sister may wed and pro- 
duce offspring,” Scytale said. 

“Why do you speak of the 
sister?” Edric asked. 

“The Emperor may choose a 
mate for her,” Scytale said. 

“Let him choose. Already, it 
is too late.” 

“Even you cannot invent the 
next moment,” Scytale warned. 
“You are not a creator. .any 
more than are the Atreides.” He 
nodded. “We must not presume 
too much.” 

“We aren’t the ones to flap 
our tongues about creation,” 
Edric protested. “We aren’t the 
rabble trying to make a messiah 
out of Maud'dib. What is this 
nonsense?” 



“It's this planet,” Scytale said. 
“It raises questions.” 

“Planets don’t speak!” 

“This one does.” 

“Oh?” , 

“It speaks of creation. Sand 
blowing in the night, that is crea- 
tion.” 

“Sand blowing. .” 

“When you awaken, the first 
light shows you the new 
world— -all fresh and ready for 
your tracks.” 

Untracked sand? Creation? 
Edric felt knotted with sudden 
anxiety. The confinement of his 
tank, the surrounding room, 
everything closed in upon him, 
constricted him. 

Tracks in sand. 

“You talk like a Fremen,” 
Edric said. 

“This is a Fremen thought and 
it’s instructive,” Scytale agreed. 
“They speak of Mauad'dib’s Jihad 
as leaving tracks in the universe 
in the same way that a Fremen 
tracks new sand. They've marked 
out a trail in men’s lives.” 

“So?” 

“Another night comes,” Scytale 
said. “Winds blow.” 

“Yes,” Edric said, “the Jihad 
is finite. Muad’dib has used his 
Jihad and. .” 

“He didn’t use the Jihad,” 
Scytale said. “The Jihad used him. 
T think he’d have stopped it if 
he could.” 

“If he could? All he had to 
do was. .” 



hrt H, be still!” Scytale barked, 
w “You can’t stop a mental

epidemic. It leaps from person 
to person across parsecs. It’s 
overwhelmingly contagious. It 
strikes at the unprotected side, 
in the place where we lodge the 
fragments of other such plagues. 
Who can stop such a thing? 
Muad'dib hasn’t the antidote. The 
thing has roots in chaos. Can or- 
ders reach there?” 

“Have you been infected 
then?” Edric asked. He turned 
slowly in the orange gas, wonder- 
ing why Scytale’s words carried 
such a tone of fear. Had the Face 
Dancer broken from the con- 
spiracy? There was no way to 
peer into the future and examine 
this now. The future had become 
a muddy stream, clogged with 
prophets. 

“We’re all contaminated.” 
Scytale said, and he reminded 
hntself that Edric’s intelligence 
had severe limits. How could this 
point be made that the Guildsman 
would understand it? 

“But when we destroy him,” 
Edric said, “the contag. .” 

“I should leave you in this 
ignorance,” Scytale said. “But my 
duties will not permit it. Besides, 
it’s dangerous to all of us.” 

Edric recoiled, steadying 
himself with a kick of one webbed 
foot which sent the orange gas 
whipping around his legs. “You 
speak strangely,” he said. 

“This whole thing is explosive,” 
Scytale said in a calmer voice. 
“It’s ready to shatter. W'hen it 
goes, it will send bits of itself 
out through the centuries. Don’t 
you see this?” 

“We’ve dealt with religions 

126 



before,” Edric protested. “If this 
new. .” 

“It is not just a religion!” 
Scytale said, wondering what the 
Reverend Mother would say to 
this harsh education of their 
fellow conspirator. “Religious 
government is something else. 
Muad'dib has crowded his 
Qizarate in everywhere, displaced 
the old functions of government. 
But he has no permanent civil 
service, no interlocking embassies. 
He has bishoprics, islands of 
authority. At the center of each 
island is a man. Men learn how 
to gain and hold personal power. 
Men are jealous.” 

“When they’re divided, we’ll 
absorb them one by one,” Edric 
said with a complacent smile. 
“Cut off the head and the body 
will fall to. 

“This body has two heads,” 
Scytale said. 

“The sister. .who may wed.” 
“Who will certainly wed.” 

“1 don’t like your tone, 
Scytale.” 

“And I don't like your 
ignorance.” 

“What if she does wed? Wilt 
that shake our plans?” 

“It will shake the universe.” 
“But they’re not unique. I, 
myself, possess powers which. ...” 
“You’re an infant. You toddle 
where they stride.” 

“They are not unique!” 

“You forget, Guildsman, that 
we once made a Kwisatz 
Haderach. This is a being filled 
by the spectacle of Time. It is 
a form of existence which cannot 
be threatened without enclosing 

GALAXY 



yourself in the identical threat. 
Muad'dib knows we would attack 
his Chani. We must move faster 
than we have. You must get to 
the ghola, prod him as 1 have 
instructed.” 

"And if I do not?” 

“We will feel the thunderbolt.”

Oh, worm of many teeth , const

The flesh and breath which lure

To cover intoxications of divinity 
Or hide the burnings of desire !

from the Dunebook 

P AUL had worked up a sweat on 
the practice floor using crys- 
knife and short sword against the 
ghola. He stood now at a window 
looking down into the temple 
plaza and tried to imagine the 
scene with Chani at the clinic. 
She’d been taken ill at mid- 
morning, the sixth week of her 
pregnancy. The medics were the 
best. They’d call when they had 
news. 

Murky afternoon sandclouds 
darkened the sky over the plaza. 
Fremen called such weather dirty 
air. 

Would the medics never call? 
Each second struggled past, 
reluctant to enter his universe. 

Waiting. .waiting. The Bene 
Gesserit sent no word from 

DUNE MESSIAH 



Wallach. Deliberately delaying, of 
cou rse. 

Prescient vision had recorded 
these moments, but he shielded 
his awareness from the oracle, 
preferring the role here of a 
timefish swimming not where he 
willed, but where the currents 
carried him. Destiny permitted no 
struggles now. 

The ghola could be heard rack- 
ing weapons, examining the 
equipment. Paul sighed, put a 
hand to his own belt and deac- 
tivated his shield. The tingling 
passage of its field ran down 
against his skin. 

He'd face events when Chani 
came, Paul told himself. Time 
enough then to accept the fact 
that what he’d concealed from her 
had prolonged her life. Was it 
evil, he wondered, to prefer Chani 
to an heir? By what right did 
he make her choice for her? 
Foolish thoughts! Who could 
hesitate, given the alter- 
natives — slave pits, bodily torture, 
agonizing sorrow. .and worse. 

He heard the door open, 
followed by Chani's footsteps. 

Paul turned. 

Murder sat on Chani’s face. 
The wide Fremen belt which 
gathered the waist of her golden 
robe, the water rings worn as a 
necklace, one hand at her hip, 
never far from the knife, the 
trenchant stare which was her first 
inspection of a room, any 
room — everything about her stood 
now only as a background for 
violence. 

He opened his arms as she 
came to him, gathered her close. 

127 



“Someone,” she rasped, speak- 
ing against his breast, “has been 
feeding me a contraceptive for a 
long time. .before I began the 
new diet. There’ll be problems 
with this birth because of it.” 

“But there are remedies?” he 
asked. 

“Dangerous remedies. I know 
the source of that poison! I'll have 
her blood.” 

“My Sihaya,” he whispered, 
holding her close to calm a sudden 
trembling. “You’ll bear the heir 
we want. Isn’t that enough?” 

“My life burns faster,” she said, 
pressing against him. “The birth 
now controls my life. The medics 
told me it goes at a terrible pace-. 
I must eat and eat. .and take 
more spice, as well. .eat it, drink 
it. I’ll kill her for this!” 

Paul kissed her cheek. “No. my 
Sihaya. Y’ou’U kill no one.” And 
he thought: Irulan prolonged your 
life, beloved. For you, the time 
of birth is the time of death. 

H E felt hidden grief drain his 
marrow then, empty his life into 
a black flask. 

Chani pushed away from him. 
“She cannot be forgiven!” 

“Who said anything about 
forgiving?” 

“Then why shouldn’t I kill 
her?” 

It was such a flat, Fremen 
question that Paul felt himself 
almost overcome by a hysterical 
desire to laugh. He covered it 
by saying: “It wouldn’t help.” 
“You’ve seen that?” 

Paul felt his belly tighten with 
vision-memory. 

123 



“What I've seen. .what I’ve 
seen. .” he muttered. Every 
aspect of surrounding events fitted 
a present which paralyzed him. 
He felt chained to a future which, 
exposed too often, had locked on- 
to him like a greedy succubus. 
Tight dryness clogged his throat. 
Had he followed the witchcall 
of his own oracle, he wondered, 
until it had spilled him into a 
merciless present? 

“Tell me what you’ve seen," 
Chani said. 

“I can’t.” 

“Why mustn’t I kill her?” 

“Because I ask it.” 

He watched her accept this. She 
did it the way sand accepted 
water, absorbing and concealing. 
Was there obedience beneath that 
hot, angry surface? He realized 
then that life in the royal Keep 
had left Chani unchanged. She’d 
merely stopped here for a time, 
inhabiting a way station on a 
journey with her man. Nothing 
of the desert had been taken from 
her. 

Chani stepped away from him 
then and glanced at the ghola who 
stood waiting near the diamond 
circle of the practice floor. 

“You’ve been crossing blades 
with him?” she asked. 

“And I’m better for it.” 

Her gaze went to the circle on 
the floor, back to the ghola’s 
metallic eyes. 

“I don’t like it,” she said. 

“He’s not intended to do me 
violence,” Paul said. 

“You’ve seen that?" 

“I’ve not seen it!” 

“Then how do you know?” 

GALAXY 



“Because he’s more than ghola; 
he’s Duncan Idaho.” 

“The Bene Tleilax made him.” 
“They made more than they 
intended.” 

She shook her head. A corner 
of her nezhoni scarf rubbed the 
collar of her robe. “How can you 
change the fact that he is ghola?” 
“Hayt,” Paul said, “are you the 
tool of my undoing?” 

“If the substance of here and 
now is changed, the future is 
changed,” the ghola said. 

“That is no answer!” Chani 
objected. 

Paul raised his voice: “How 
will I die, Hayt?” 

Light glinted from the artificial 
eyes. “It is said, m’Lord, that 
you will die of money and power.” 
Chani stiffened. “How dare he 
speak thus to you?” 

“The mentat is truthful,” Paul 
said. 

“Was Duncan Idaho a real 
friend?” she asked. 

“He gave his life for me.” 

“It is sad,” Chani whispered, 
“that a ghola cannot be restored 
to his original being.” 

“Would you convert me?” the 
ghola asked, directing his gaze to 
Chani. 

“What does he mean?” Chani 
asked. 

“To be converted is to be turn- 
ed around,” Paul said. “But 
there’s no going back.” 

“Every man carries his own 
past with him,” Hayt said. 

“And every ghola?” Paul asked. 
“In a way, m’Lord.” 

“Then what of that past in your 
secret flesh?” Paul asked. 



C HANI saw how the question 
disturbed the ghola. His move- 
ments quickened, his hands 
clenched into fists. She glanced 
at Paul, wondering why he probed 
thus. Was there a way to restore 
this creature to the man he’d 
been? 

“Has a ghola ever remembered 
his real past?” Chani asked. 

“Many attempts have been 
made,” Hayt said, his gaze fixed 
on the floor near his feet. “No 
ghola has ever been restored to 
his former being.” 

“But you long for this to hap- 
pen,” Paul said. 

The blank surfaces of the 
ghola’s eyes came up to center 
on Paul with a pressing intensity. 
“Yes!” 

Sighing softly, Paul said: “If 
there’s a way. .” 

“This flesh,”. Hayt said, 
touching left hand to forehead in 
a curious saluting movement, “is 
not the flesh of my original birth. 
It is. .re-born. Only the shape 
is familiar. A Face Dancer might 
do as well.” 

“Not as well,” Paul said. “And 
you’re not a Face Dancer.” 

“That is true, m’Lord.” 
“Whence comes your shape?” 
“The genetic imprint of the 
original cells.” 

“Somewhere,” Paul slowly said, 
“there’s a plastic something which 
remembers the shape of Duncan 
Idaho. It’s said that the ancients 
probed our region before the 
Butlcrian Jihad. What’s the extent 
of this memory, Hayt? What did 
it learn from the original?" 

The ghola shrugged. 



DUNE MESSIAH

“What if he wasn't Idaho?” 
Chani asked. 

“He was.” 

“Can you be certain?” 

“He is Duncan in every aspect. 
I cannot imagine a force strong 
enough to hold that shape thus 
without any relaxation or any de- 
viation.” 

“M’Lord!” Hayt objected. 
“Because we cannot imagine a 
thing, that doesn’t exclude it from 
reality. There are things I must 
do as a ghola that I would not 
do as a man.” 

Keeping his attention on Chani, 
Paul said: “You see?” 

She nodded. 

Paul turned away, fighting deep 
sadness. He crossed to the bal- 
cony windows and drew the 
draperies. Lights came on in the 
sudden gloom. He pulled the sash 
of his robe tight, listening for 
sounds behind him. 

Nothing. 

He turned. Chani stood as 
though entranced, her gaze cen- 
tered on the ghola. 

Hayt, Paul saw, had retreated 
to some inner chamber of his be- 
ing — had gone back to the ghola 
place. 

C HANI turned at the sound of 
Paul’s return. She still felt the 
thralldom of the instant Paul had 
precipitated. For a brief moment, 
the ghola had been an intense, 
vital human being. For that mo- 
ment, he had been someone she 
did not fear — indeed, someone 
;he liked and admired. Now, she 
Understood Paul’s purpose in this 
probing. He had wanted her to 

130 



see the man in the ghola flesh. 

She stared at Paul. “That man, 
was that Duncan Idaho?” 

“That was Duncan Idaho. He 
is still there.” 

“Would he have allowed Irulan 
to go on living?” Chani asked. 

The water didn’t sink too deep, 
Paul thought. And he said: “If 
I commanded it.” 

“1 don’t understand,” she said. 
“Shouldn’t you be angry?” 

“I am angry.” 

“You don’t sound. .angry. 
You sound sorrowful.” 

He closed his eyes. “Yes. That, 
too.” 

“You’re my man,” she said. 
“I know this, but suddenly I don’t 
understand you.” 

Abruptly, Paul felt that he 
walked down a long cavern. His 
flesh moved — one foot and then 
another — but his thoughts went 
elsewhere. “I don’t understand 
myself,” he whispered. When he 
opened his eyes, he found that 
he had moved away from Chani. 

She spoke from somewhere 
behind him. “Beloved, I’ll not ask 
again what you’ve seen. I only 
know I’m to give you the heir 
we want.” 

He nodded then. “I’ve known 
that from the beginning.” He 
turned and studied her. Chani 
seemed very far away. 

She drew herself up, placing 
a hand on her abdomen. “I’m 
hungry. The medics tell me I 
must eat three or four times what 
I ate before. I’m frightened, 
beloved. It goes too fast.” 

Too fast, he agreed. This fetus 
knows the necessity for speed.

The audacious nature of 
Muad'dib’s actions may be seen 
in the fact that He knew from 
the beginning whither He was 
bound, yet not once did He step 
aside from that path. He put it 
clearly when He said : “l tell you 
that l come now to my time of 
testing when it will be shown that 
I am the Ultimate Servant.” Thus 
He weaves all into One, that both 
friend and joe may worship Him. 
It is for this reason and this 
reason only that His Apostles 
prayed: ‘‘Lord, save us from the 
other paths which Muad’dib cov- 
ered with the Waters of His Life." 
Those “other paths” may be 
imagined only with the deepest 
revulsion. 

— from the Yiam-el-Din 
(Book of Judgment) 

T HE messenger was a young 
woman — her face, name and 
family known to Chani — which 
was how she’d penetrated Im- 
perial Security. 

Chani had done no more than 
identify her for a Security Officer 
named Bannerjee, who then ar- 
ranged the meeting with 
Muad’dib. Bannerjee acted out of 
instinct and the assurance that the 
young woman’s father had been 
a member of the Emperor’s Death 
Commandos, the dreaded 
Fedaykin, in the days before the 
Jihad. Otherwise, he might have 
ignored her plea that her message 
was intended only for the ears 
of Muad’dib. 

She was, of course, screened 

DUNE MESSIAH 



and searched before the meeting 
in Paul's private office. Even so, 
Bannerjee accompanied her, hand 
on knife, other hand on her arm. 

It was almost mid-day when 
they brought her into the 
room — an odd space, a mixture 
of desert-Fremen and Family- 
Aristocrat. Hiereg hangings lined 
three walls, delicate tapestries 
adorned with figures out of Fre- 
men mythology. A view screen 
covered the fourth wall, a silver 
gray surface behind an oval desk 
whose top held only one object, 
a Fremen sandclock built into an 
orrery. The orrery, a suspensor 
mechanism from lx, carried both 
moons of Arrakis in the classic 
Worm Trine aligned with the sun. 

Paul, standing beside the desk, 
glanced at Bannerjee. The 
Security Officer was one of those 
who’d come up through the Fre- 
men Constabulary, winning his 
place on brains and proven loyalty 
despite the smuggler ancestry at- 
tested by his name. He was a 
solid figure, almost fat. Wisps of 
black hair fell down over the dark, 
wet-appearing skin of his forehead 
like the crest of an exotic bird. 
His eyes were blue-blue and 
steady in a gaze which could look 
upon happiness or atrocity 
without change of expression. 
Both Chani and Stilgar trusted 
him. Paul knew that if he told 
Bannerjee to throttle the girl im- 
mediately, Bannerjee would do it. 

“Sire, here is the messenger 
girl,” Bannerjee said. “M’Lady 
Chani said she sent word to you.” 

“Yes.” Paul nodded curtly. 

Oddly, the girl didn't look at 

131 



him. Her attention remained on 
the orrery. She was dark-skinned, 
of medium height, her figure con- 
cealed beneath a robe whose rich 
wine fabric and simple cut spoke 
of wealth. Her blue-black hair 
was held in a narrow band of 
material which matched the robe. 
The robe concealed her hands. 
Paul suspected that the hands 
were tightly clasped. It would be 
in character. Everything about her 
would be in character — including 
the robe, a last piece of finery 
saved for such a moment. 

Paul motioned Bannerjee aside. 
He hesitated before obeying. Now, 
the girl moved — one step forward. 
When she moved there was grace. 
Still, her eyes avoided him. 

Paul cleared his throat. 

N OW, the girl lifted her gaze, 
the whiteless eyes widening 
with just the right shade of awe. 
She had an odd little face with 
delicate chin, a sense of reserve 
in the way she held her small 
mouth. The eyes appeared ab- 
normally large above slanted 
cheeks. There was a cheerless air 
about her, something which said 
she seldom smiled. The corners 
of her eyes even held a faint 
yellow misting which could have 
been from dust irritation or the 
tracery of semuta. 

Everything was in character. 
“You asked to see me,” Paul 
said. 

The moment of supreme test 
for this girl-shape had come. 
Scytale had put on the shape, the 
mannerisms, the sex, the 
voice — everything his abilities 

132 



could grasp and assume. But this 
was a female known to Muad’dib 
in the sietch days. She’d been a 
child, then, but she and Muad’dib ] 
shared common experiences. Cer- 
tain areas of memory must be 
avoided delicately. It was the most 
exacting part Scytale had ever at- 
tempted. 

“I am Olheym’s Lichna of Berk ; 
al Dib.” 

The girl’s voice came out small, 
but firm, giving name, father and 1 
pedigree. 

Paul nodded. He saw how 
Chani had been fooled. The tim- 
ber of voice, everything was re- 
produced with exactitude. Had it 
not been for his own Bene 
Gesserit training in voice and for 
the web of dao in which oracular j 
vision enfolded him, this Face 
Dancer disguise might have gulled 
even him. 

Training exposed certain 
discrepancies: the girl was older ' 
than her known years; too much 
control tuned the vocal chords; 
the set of neck and shoulders 
missed by a fraction the subtle 
hauteur of Fremen poise. But 
there were niceties, too: the rich 
robe had been patched to betray 
actual status. .and the features 
were beautifully exact. They 
spoke a certain sympathy of this 
face dancer for the role being 
played. 

“Rest in my home, daughter 
of Otheym,” Paul said in formal 
Fremen greeting. “You are wel- 
come as water after a draught.” 

The faintest of relaxations ex- 
posed the confidence this apparent 
acceptance had conveyed. 

GALAXY 



“I bring a message,” she said. 

“A man’s messenger is as 
himself,” Paul said. 

Scytale breathed softly. It went 
well, but now came the crucial 
task; the Atreides must be guided 
onto that special path. He must 
lose his Fremen concubine in cir- 
cumstances where no other shared 
the blame. The failure must 
belong only to the omnipotent 
Muad’dib. He had to be led into 
an ultimate realization of his 
failure and thence to acceptance 
of the Tleilaxu alternative. 

“I am the smoke which 
banishes sleep in the night,” 
Scytale said, employing a 
Fedaykin code phrase: / bear bad 
tidings. 



P AUL fought to maintain calm- 
ness. He felt naked, his soul 
abandoned in a groping-time con- 
cealed from every vision. Powerful 
oracles hid this Face Dancer. Only 
the edges of these moments were 
known to Paul. He knew only 
what he could not do. He could 
not slay the Face Dancer. That 
would precipitate the future which 
must be avoided at all cost. 
Somehow, a way must be found 
to reach into the darkness and 
change the terrifying pattern. 

“Give me your message,” Paul 
said. 

Bannerjee moved to place 
himself where he could watch 
the girl’s face. She seemed to 
notice him for the first time and 
her gaze went to the knife handle 
beneath the Security officer’s 
hand. 

DUNE MESSIAH 



“The innocent do not believe 
in evil,” she said, looking squarely 
at Bannerjee. 

Ahhh, well done, Paul thought. 
It was what the real Lichna would 
have said. He felt a momentary 
pang for the real daughter of 
Otheym — dead now, a corpse in 
thg sand. There was no time for 
such emotions, though. He scowl- 
ed. 

Bannerjee kept his attention on 
the girl. 

“I was told to deliver my 
message in secret,” she said. 

“Why?” Bannerjee demanded, 
voice harsh, probing. 

“Because it is my father’s 
wish.” 

“This is my friend,” Paul said. 
“Am l not a Fremen? Then my 
friend may hear anything I hear.” 

Scytale composed the girl- 
shape. Was this a true Fremen 
custom. .or was it a test? 

“The Emperor may make his 
own rules,” Scytale said. “This 
is the message: My father wishes 
you to come to him, bringing 
Chani.” 

“Why must I bring Chani?” 

“She is your woman and a 
Sayyadina. This is a Water matter, 
by the rules of our tribes. She 
must attest it that my father 
speaks according to the Fremen 
Way.” 

There truly are Fremen in the 
conspiracy, Paul thought. This 
moment fitted the shape of things 
to come for sure. And he had 
no alternative but to commit 
himself to this course. 

“Of what will your father 
speak?” Paul asked. .1 

133 



“He will speak of a plot against 
you — a plot among the Fremen.” 
“Why doesn’t lie bring that 
message in person?” Bannerjee 
demanded. 

She kept her gaze on Paul. “My 
father cannot come here. The 
plotters suspect him. He’d not 
survive the journey.” 

“Could he not divulge the plot 
to you?” Bannerjee asked. “How 
c,ime he to risk his daughter on 
such a mission?” 

“The details are locked in a 
distrans carrier that only 
Mnud'dib may open,” she said. 
“This much I know.” 

“Why not send the distrans, 
then?” Paul asked. 

“It is a human distrans,” she 
said. 

“I’ll go, then,” Paul said. “But 
I’ll go alone.” 

“Chani must come with you!” 
“Chani is with child.” 

“When has a Fremen woman 
refused to. .” 

“My enemies fed her a subtle 
poison,” Paul said. “It will be 
a difficult birth. Her health will 
not permit her to accompany me 
now.” 



B EFORE Scytale could still 
them, strange emotions passed 
over the girl -features — frustration, 
then anger. Scytale was reminded 
that every victim must have a 
way of escape — -even such a one 
as Muad’dib. The conspiracy had 
not failed, though. This Atreides 
remained in the net.. Fie was a 
creature who had developed 
firmly into one pattern. He’d 

134 



destroy himself before changing 
into the opposite of that pattern. 
That had been the way with the 
Tleilaxu kwisatz haderach. It 
would be the way with this one. 
And then. the ghola. 

“Let me ask Chani to decide 
this,” she said. 

“I have decided it,” Paul said. 
“You will accompany me in 
Chani’s stead.” 

“It requires a Sayyadina of the 
Rite!” 

“Are you not Chani’s friend?” 
Boxed! Scytale thought. Does 
he suspect? No. He’s being Fre- 
men-caulious. And the contracep- 
tive is a fact. Well — there are 
other ways. 

“My father told me I was not 
to return,” Scytale said, “that I 
was to seek asylum with you. He 
said you’d not risk me.” 

Paul nodded. It was beautifully 
in character. He couldn’t deny this 
asylum. She’d plead Fremen obe- 
dience to a father’s command. 

“Ell take Stilgar’s wife, Harah,” 
Paul said. “You’ll tell us the way 
to your father.” 

“How do you know you can 
trust Stilgar’s wife?” 

“I know it.” 

“But 1 don’t.” 

Paul pursed his lips. “Does 
your mother live?” 

“My true mother has gone to 
Shai-hulud. My second mother 
still lives and cares for my father. 
Why?” 

“She’s of Sietch Tabr?” 

“Yes.” 

“1 remember her,” Paul said? 
“She will serve in Chani’s place.” 
He motioned to Bannerjee. “Have 

GALAXY 



attendants take Otheym’s Lichna 
to suitable quarters.” 

Bannerjee nodded. Attendants. 
The key word meant that this 
messenger must be put under spe- 
cial guard. He took her arm. She 
resisted. 

“How will you go to my 
father?” she pleaded. 

“You'll describe the way to 
Bannerjee,” Paul said. “He is my 
friend.” 

“No! My father had command- 
ed it! I cannot!” 

“Bannerjee?” Paul said. 

Bannerjee paused. Paul saw the 
man searching that encyclopedic 
memory which had helped bring 
him to his position of trust. “I 
know a guide who can take you 
to Otheym,” Bannerjee said. 

“Then I’ll go alone,” Paul said, 
j, “Sire, if you. .” 
r “Otheym wants it this way,” 
Paul said, barely concealing the 
irony which consumed him. 

“Sire, it’s too dangerous,” Ban- 
nerjee protested. 

“Even an Emperor must accept 
some risks,” Paul said. “The 
decision is made. Do as I’ve com- 
manded.” 

Reluctantly, Bannerjee led the 
face dancer from the room. 

J Paul turned toward the blank 
screen behind his desk. He felt 
that he waited for the arrival of 
a rock on its blind journey from 
some height. 

j Should he tell Bannerjee about 
the messenger’s true nature? No! 
Such an incident hadn't been 
written on the screen of his vision. 
Any deviation here carried pre- 
cipitate violence. A moment of 

DUNE MESSIAH 



fulcrum had to be found, a place 
where he could will himself out 
of the vision. 

If such a moment existed. 
XV 

No matter how exotic human 
civilization becomes, no matter 
the developments of life and so- 
ciety nor the complexity of the 
machine/human interface, there 
always come interludes of lonely 
power when the course of hu- 
mankind, the very future of hu- 
mankind, depends upon the 
relatively simple actions of single 
individuals. 

— from The Tleilaxu Codbuk 

A S HE crossed over on the high 
footbridge from his Keep to 
the Qizarate Office Building, Paul 
added a limp to his walk. It was 
almost sunset and he walked 
through long shadows that helped 
conceal him, but sharp eyes still 
might detect something in his car- 
riage that identified him. He wore 
a shield, but it was not activated, 
his aides having decided that the 
shimmer of it might arouse suspi- 
cions. 

Paul glanced left. Strings of 
sandclouds lay across the sunset 
like slatted shutters. The air was 
hiereg dry through his stillsuit 
filters. 

He wasn’t really alone out here, 
but the web of Security hadn't 
been this loose around him since 
he’d ceased walking the streets 
alone in the night. Ornithopters 
with night scanners drifted far 

135 



overhead in seemingly random 
pattern, all of them tied to his 
movements through a transmitter 
concealed in his clothing. Picked 
men walked the street below. 
Others had fanned out through 
the city after seeing the Emperor 
in his disguise — Fremen costume 
down to the stillsuit and temag 
desert boots, the darkened 
features. His cheeks had been 
distorted with plastene inserts. A 
eatchtube ran down along his left 
jaw. 

As he reached the opposite end 
of the bridge, Paul glanced back, 
noting a movement beside the 
stone lattice that concealed a bal- 
cony of his private quarters. 
Chani, no doubt. “Hunting for 
sand in the desert,” she’d called 
this venture. 

How little she understood the 
bitter choice. Selecting among 
agonies, he thought, made even 
lesser agonies near unbearable. 

For a blurred, emotionally 
painful moment, he relived their 
parting. At the last instant, Chani 
had experienced a tau-glimpse of 
his feelings, but she had misinter- 
preted. She had thought his emo- 
tions were those experienced in 
the parting of loved ones when 
one entered the dangerous un- 
known. 

Would that 1 did not know, 
he thought. 

He had crossed the bridge now 
and entered the upper passageway 
through the office building. There 
were fixed glowglobcs here and 
people hurrying on business. The 
Oizarate never slept. Paul found 
his attention caught by the signs 

I3& 



above doorways, as though he 
were seeing them for the first 
time: Speed Merchants. Wind 

Stills and Retorts. Prophetic 
Prospects. Tests and Trials oj 
Faith. Religious Supply. Weapon- 
ry. .Propagation of the Faith. i 
A more honest label would 
have been Propagation of the 
Bureaucracy, he thought. 

A TYPE, of religious civil servant 
had sprung up all through his 
universe. This new man of the 
Qizarate was more often a con- 
vert. He seldom displaced a Fre- 
men in the key posts, but he was 
filling all the interstices. He used 
melange as much to show he 
could afford it as for the geriatric 
benefits. He stood apart from his 
rulers — Emperor, Guild, Bene 
Gesserit, Eandsraad, Family or 
Qizarate. His gods were Routine 
and Records. He was served by 
men tats and prodigious filing 
systems. Expediency was the first 
word in his catechism, although 
he gave proper lip service to the 
precepts of the Butlerians. 
Machines could not be fashioned 
in the image of a man’s mind, 
he said, but he betrayed by every 
action that he preferred machines 
to men, statistics to individuals, 
the far away general view to the 
intimate personal touch requiring 
imagination and initiative. 

As Paul emerged onto the ramp 
at the far side of the building, 
he heard the bells calling the 
Evening Rite at Alia’s Fane. 

The temple across the throng- 
ed square was new, its rituals of 
recent devising, but there was 

GALAXY 



something about this setting in 
a desert sink at the edge of Ar- 
rakeen — something in the way 
wind-driven sand had begun to 
weather stones and plastene, 
something in the haphazard way 
buildings had gone up around the 
fane. Everything conspired to 
produce the impression that this 
was a very old place full of tradi- 
tions and mystery. 

He was down into the press 
of people now — committed. The 
only guide his Security force could 
find had insisted it be done this 
way. Security hadn’t liked Paul's 
ready agreement. Stilgar had liked 
it even less. And Chani had ob- 
jected most of all. 

The crowd around him, even 
while its members brushed against 
him, glanced his way unseeing and 
passed on, gave him a curious 
freedom of movement. It was the 
way they’d been conditioned to 
treat a Fremen, he knew. He car- 
ried himself like a man of the 
inner desert. Such men were quick 
to anger. 

As he moved into the quicken- 
ing flow to the temple steps, the 
crush of people became * even 
greater. Those all around could 
not help but press against him 
now, but he found himself the 
target for ritual apologies: “Your 
pardon, noble sir. I cannot pre- 
vent this discourtesy.” “Pardon, 
sir; this crush of people is the 
worst I’ve ever seen.” “I abase 
myself, holy citizen. A lout shoved 
me.” 

Paul ignored the words after 
the first few. There was no feeling 
in them except a kind of ritual 

DUNE MESSIAH 



fear. He found himself, instead, 
thinking that he had come a long 
way from his boyhood days in 
Caladan Castle. Where had he put 
his foot on the path that led to 
this journey across a crowded 
square on a planet so far from 
Caladan? Had he really put his 
foot on a path? He could not 
say he had acted at any point 
in his life for one specific reason. 
The motives and impinging forces 
had been complex — more com- 
plex possibly than any other set 
of goads in human history. He 
had the heady feeling here that 
he might still avoid the fate he 
could see so clearly along this 
path. But the crowd pushed him 
forward and he experienced the 
dizzy sense that he had lost his 
way, lost personal direction over 
his life. 

The crowd flowed with him up 
the steps now into the temple 
portico. Voices grew hushed. The 
smell of fear grew stronger — 
acrid, sweaty. 



A COLYTES had already begun 
the service within the temple. 
Their plain chant dominated the 
other sounds — whispers, rustle of 
garments, shuffling of restless feet, 
coughs— telling the story of the 
Far Places visited by the Priestess 
in her holy trance. 

She rides the sandworm of 
space! 

She guides through all storms 
Into the land of gentle winds. 
Though we sleep by the snake’s 
den, 

137 



She guards our dreaming souls. 
Shunning the desert heat, 

She hides us in a cool hollow. 
The gleaming of her white teeth 
Guides us in the night. 

By the braids of her hair 
We are lifted up to heaven! 
Sweet fragrance, flower-scented 
Surrounds us in her presence. 

Balak! Paul thought, thinking 
in Fremen. Look out! She can 
be filled with angry passion, too. 

The temple portico was lined 
with tall, slender glowtubes 
simulating candle flame. They 
flickered. The flickering stirred 
ancestral memories in Paul even 
while he knew that was the intent. 
This setting was an atavism, 
subtly contrived, effective. He 
hated his own hand in it. 

The crowd flowed with him 
through tall metal doors into the 
gigantic nave, a gloomy place with 
the flickering lights far away 
overhead, a brilliantly illuminated 
altar at the far end. Behind the 
altar, a deceptively simple affair 
of black wood encrusted with sand 
patterns -from the Fremen 
mythology, hidden lights played 
on the field of a pru-door to 
create a rainbow borealis. The 
seven rows of chanting acolytes 
ranged below that spectral curtain 
suddenly took on a stark, eerie 
quality — black robes, white faces, 
mouths moving in unison. 

Paul studied the pilgrims 
around him, suddenly envious of 
their intentness, their air of listen- 
ing to truths he could not hear. 
It seemed to him that they gained 
something here which was denied 

138 



to him, something mysteriously 
healing. 

He tried to inch his way closer 
to the altar and was stopped by 
a hand on his arm. Paul whipped 
his gaze around to meet the prob- 
ing stare of an ancient Fre- 
men — blue-blue eyes beneath 

overhanging brows, recognition in 
them. A name flashed into Paul’s 
mind: Rasir, a companion from 
the sietch days. 

In the press of the crowd, Paul 
knew he would be completely 
vulnerable if Rasir planned 
violence. 

The old man pressed close, one 
hand beneath a sand-grimed 
robe — grasping the hilt of a 
crysknife, no doubt. Paul set 
himself as best he could to resist 
attack. The old man moved his 
head toward Paul's ear and 
whispered: “We will go with the 
others.” 

It was the signal to identify 
his guide. Paul nodded. 

Rasir drew back and faced the 
altar. 

“She comes from the east,” the 
acolytes chanted. “The sun stands 
at her back. All things are expos- 
ed. The full glare of light — her 
eyes miss no thing, neither light 
nor dark.” 

A wailing rebaba jarred across 
the voices, stilled them and 
receded into silence. With an 
electric abruptness, the crowd 
surged forward several meters. 
They were packed into a tight 
mass of flesh now, the air heavy 
with their breathing and the scent 
of spice. 

“Shai-hulud writes on clean 

GALAXY 



sand!” the pale acolytes shouted. 

P AUL felt his own breath catch 
in unison with those around 
him. A feminine chorus began 
singing faintly from the shadows 
behind the shimmering pru-door: 
“Alia. .Alia. It grew louder 
and louder, fell to sudden silence. 

Again — voices beginning vesper 
soft: 

She stills all storms — 

Her eyes kill our enemies, 

And torment the unbelievers. 
From the spires of Tuono 
Where dawnlight strikes 
And clear water runs, 

You see her shadow. 

In the shining summer heat 
She serves us bread and milk — - 
Cool, fragrant with spices. 

Her eyes melt our enemies, 
Torment our oppressors 
And pierce all mysteries. 

She is Alia. .Alia. .Alia. 

Slowly, the voices trailed off. 
Paul felt sickened. What are 
we doing? he asked himself. Alia 
was a child witch, but she was 
growing older. And he thought: 
Growing older is to grow more 
wicked. 

The collective mental at- 
mosphere of the temple ate at 
his psyche. He could sense that 
element of himself which was one 
with those all around him, but 
the differences formed a deadly 
contradiction. He stood immersed, 
isolated in a personal sin which 
he could never expiate. The im- 
mensity of the universe outside 
the temple flooded his awareness. 

DUNE MESSIAH 



How could one man, one ritual, 
hope to knit such immensity into 
a garment fitted to all men? 

The universe opposed him at 
every step. It eluded his grasp, 
conceived countless disguises to 
delude him. That universe would 
never agree with any shape he 
gave it. 

A profound hush spread 
through the temple. 

Alia emerged from the darkness 
behind the shimmering rainbows. 
She wore a yellow robe trimmed 
in Atreides green— yellow for 
sunlight, green for the death which 
produced life. Paul experienced 
the sudden surprising thought that 
Alia had emerged here just for 
him, for him alone. He stared 
across the mob in the temple at 
his sister. She was his sister. He 
knew her ritual and its roots, but 
he had never before stood out 
here with the pilgrims or watched 
her through their eyes. Here, per- 
forming the mystery of this place, 
he saw that she partook of the 
universe which opposed him. 

Acolytes brought her a golden 
chalice. 

Alia raised the chalice. 

With part of his awareness, 
Paul knew that the chalice con- 
tained the unaltered melange, the 
subtle poison, her sacrament of 
the oracle. 

Her gaze on the chalice, Alia 
spoke. Her voice caressed the ears 
flower sound, flowing and 
musical : 

“In the beginning, we were 
empty,” she said. 

“Ignorant of all things,” the 
chorus sang. 

139 



“We did not know the Power 
that abides in every place,” Alia 
said. 

“And in every Time,” the 
chorus sang. 

“Here is the Power,” Alia said, 
raising the chalice slightly. 

“It brings us joy,” sang the 
chorus. 

And it brings us distress, Paul 
thought. 

“It awakens the soul,” Alia 
said. 

“It dispels all doubts,” the 
chorus sang. 

“In worlds, we perish,” Alia 
said. 

“In the Power, we survive,” 
sang the chorus. 

Alia put the chalice to her lips. 
She drank. 

T O HIS astonishment, Paul found 
he was. holding his breath 
like the meanest pilgrim of this 
mob. Despite every shred of 
persona! knowledge about the ex- 
perience Alia was undergoing, he 
had been caught in the tao-web. 
He felt himself remembering how 
that fiery poison coursed into the 
body. Memory unfolded the time- 
stopping when awareness became 
a mote which changed the poison. 
He re-experienced the awakening 
into timelessness where all things 
were possible. He knew Alia’s 
present experience, yet he saw 
now that he did not know it. 
Mystery blinded the eyes. 

Alia trembled and sank to her 
knees'. 

Paul exhaled with the enrap- 
tured pilgrims. He nodded. Part 
of the veil began to lift from him. 

140 



Absorbed in the bliss of a vision, 
he had forgotten that each vision 
belonged to all those who were 
still on-the-way, stili to become. 
In the vision, one passed through 
a darkness, unable to distinguish 
reality from insubstantial accident. 
One hungered for absolutes which 
could never be. 

Hungering, one lost the present. 

Alia swayed with the rapture 
of spice change. 

Paul felt that some transcen- 
dental presence spoke to him, 
saying: “Look! See there! See 

what you’ve ignored?” In that 

instant, he thought he looked 
through other eyes, that he saw 
an imagery and rhythm in this 
place which no artist or poet 

could reproduce. It was vital and 
beautiful, a glaring light that ex- 
posed all power-gluttony. .even 
his own. 

Alia spoke. Her amplified voice 
boomed across the nave. 

“Luminous night,” she cried. 

A moan swept like a wave 

through the crush of pilgrims. 

“Nothing hides in such a 

night!” Alia said. “What rare light 
is this darkness? You cannot fix 
your gaze upon it! Senses cannot 
record it. No words describe it.” 
Her voice lowered. “The abyss 
remains. It is pregnant with all 
the things yet to be. Ahhhhh, what 
gentle violence!” 

Paul felt that he waited for 
some private signal from his 
sister. It could be any action or 
word, something of wizardry and 
mystical processes, an outward 
streaming that would fit him like 
an arrow into a cosmic bow. 

GALAXY 



“There will be sadness,” Alia 
intoned. “I remind you that all 
things are but a beginning, forever 
beginning. Worlds wait to be con- 
quered. Some within the sound 
of my voice will attain exalted 
destinies. You will sneer at the 
past, forgetting what I tell you 
now: within all differences there 
is unity.” 

Paul suppressed a cry of disap- 
pointment as Alia lowered her 
head. She had not said the thing 
he waited to hear. His body felt 
like a dry shell, a husk abandoned 
by some desert insect. 

Others must feel something 
similar, he thought. He sensed the 
restlessness about him. Abruptly, 
a woman in the mob, someone 
far down in the nave to Paul’s 
left, cried out, a wordless noise 
of anguish. 

A LIA lifted her head and Paul 
had the giddy sensation that the 
distance between them collapsed, 
that he stared directly into her 
glazed eyes only inches away from 
him. 

“Who summons me?” Alia 
asked. 

“I do,” the woman cried. “I 
do. Alia. Oh, Alia, help me. They 
say my son was killed on Muritan. 
Is he gone? Will I never see my 
son again. .never?” 

“You try to walk backward in 
the sand,” Alia intoned. “Nothing 
is lost. Everything returns later, 
but you may not recognize the 
changed form that returns.” 

“Alia, I don’t understand!” the 
woman wailed. 

“You live in the air but you 
DUNE MESSIAH 



do not see it,” Alia said, 
sharpness in her voice. “Are you 
a lizard? Your voice has the Fre- 
men accent. Does a Fremen try 
to bring back the dead? What 
do we need from our dead except 
their water?” 

Down in the center of the nave, 
a man in a rich red cloak lifted 
both hands, the sleeves falling to 
expose white-clad arms. “Alia,” 
he shouted, “I have had a business 
proposal. Should I accept?” 

“You come here like a begger,” 
Alia said. “You look for the gold- 
en bowl but you will find only 
a dagger.” 

“I have been asked to kill a 
man!” a voice shouted from off 
to the right — a deep voice with 
sietch tones. “Should I accept? 
Accepting, would I succeed?” 
“Beginning and end are a single 
thing,” Alia snapped. “Have I not 
told you this before? You didn’t 
come here to ask that question. 
What is it you cannot believe that 
you must come here and cry out 
against it?” 

“She’s in a fierce mood 
tonight,” a woman near Paul 
muttered. “Have you ever seen 
her this angry?” 

She- knows I'm out here, Paul 
thought. Did she see something 
in the. vision that angered her? 
Is she raging at me? 

“Alia,” a man directly in front 
of Paul called. “Tell these 
businessmen and faint hearts how 
long your brother will rule!” 

“I permit you to look around 
that corner by yourself,” Alia 
snarled. “You carry your prej- 
udice in your mouth! It is because 

Ml 



my brother rides the worm of 
chaos that you have roof and 
water!” 

With a fierce gesture, clutching 
her robe. Alia whirled away, 
strode through the shimmering 
ribbons of light and was lost in 
the darkness behind. 

Immediately, the acolytes took 
up the closing chant, but their 
rhythm was off. Obviously, they'd 
been caught by the unexpected 
ending of the rite. An incoherent 
mumbling arose on all sides of 
the crowd. Paul felt the stirring 
around him — restless, dissatisfied. 

“It was that fool with his stupid 
question about business,” a wo- 
man near Paul muttered. “The 
hypocrite!” 

What had Alia seen? What 
track through the future? 

Something had happened here 
tonight, souring the rite of the 
oracle. Usually, the crowd 
clamored for Alia to answer their 
pitiful questions. They came as 
beggars to the oracle, yes. He 
had heard them thus many times 
as he’d watched, hidden in the 
darkness behind the altar. What 
had been different about this 
night? 

The old Fremen tugged Paul’s 
sleeve and nodded toward the exit. 
The crowd already was beginning 
to push in that direction. Paul 
allowed himself to be pressed 
along with them, the guide’s hand 
upon his sleeve. There was the 
feeling in him then that his body 
had become the manifestation of 
some power he could no longer 
control. He had become a non- 
being, a stillness which moved 

142 



itself. At the core of the non- 
being, there he existed, allowing 
himself to be led through the 
streets of his city, following a 
track so familiar to his visions 
that it froze his heart with grief. 

I should know what Alia saw, 
he thought. / have seen it enough 
times myself. And she didn't cry 
out against it. .she saw the alter- 
natives, too.

Production growth and income 
growth must not get out of step 
in my Empire. That is the 
substance of my command. There 
are to be no balance-of-payment 
difficulties between the different 
spheres of influence. And the 
reason for this is simply because 
I command it. I want to 
emphasize my authority in this 
area. / am the supreme energy- 
eater of this domain, and will re- 
main so alive or dead. My 
Government is the economy.

Ul WILL leave you here,” the 
1 old man said, taking his hand 
from Paul’s sleeve. “It is on the 
right, second door from the far 
end. Go with Shai-hulud, 
Muad’dib. .and remember when 
you were Usui.” 

Paul’s guide slipped away into 
the darkness. 

There would be Security men 
somewhere out there waiting to 
grab the guide and take the man 
to a place of questioning, Paul 
knew. But Paul found himself 



GALAXY 



hoping the old Fremen would 
escape. 

There were stars overhead and 
the distant light of First Moon 
somewhere beyond the Shield 
Wall. But this place was not the 
open desert where a man could 
sight on a star to guide his course. 
The old man had brought him 
into one of the new suburbs; that 
much Paul recognized. 

This street now was thick with 
sand blown in from encroaching 
dunes. A dim light glowed from 
a single public suspensor globe 
far down the street. It gave 
enough illumination to show that 
this was a dead end street. 

The air around him was thick 
with the smell of a reclamation 
still. The thing must be poorly 
capped for its fetid odors to 
escape, loosing a dangerously 
wasteful amount of moisture into 
the night air. How careless his 
people had grown, Paul thought. 
They were millionaires of 
water — forgetful of the days 
when a man on Arrakis could 
have been killed for just an eighth 
share of the water in his body. 

Why am I hesitating? Paul 
wondered. It is the second door 
from the jar end. I knew that 
without being told. But this thing 
must be played out with precision. 
So. ./ hesitate. 

The noise of an argument arose 
suddenly from the comer house 
on Paul’s left. A woman there 
berated someone; the new wing 
of their house leaked dust, she 
complained. Did he think water 
fell from heaven? If dust came 
in, moisture got out. 

DUNE MESSIAH 



Tj 

Some remember, Paul thought. 

He moved down the street and 
the quarrel faded away behind. 

Water from heaven! he thought. 

Some Fremen had seen that 
wonder on other worlds. He had 
seen it himself, had ordered it 
for Arrakis; but the memory of 
it felt like something that had 
occurred to another person. Rain, 
it was called. Abruptly, he re- 
membered a rainstorm on his 
birthworld — clouds thick and gray 
in the sky of Caladan, an electric 
storm presence, moist air, the big 
wet drops drumming on skylights. 
It ran in rivulets off the eaves. 
Storm drains took the w'ater away 
to a river which ran muddy and 
turgid past the broad family 
orchards. .trees there with their 
barren branches glistening wetly. 

P AUL’S foot caught in a low 
drift of sand across the street 
For an instant, he felt mud cling- 
ing to the shoes of his childhood. 
Then he was back in the sand, 
in the dust-clotted, wind-muffled 
darkness with the Future hanging 
over him, taunting. He could feel 
the aridity of life around him like 
an accusation. You did this! 
They’d become a civilization of 
dry-eyed watchers and tale-tellers, 
people who solved all problems 
with power, power and more 
power — hating every erg of it. 

Rough stones came underfoot. 
His vision remembered them. The 
dark rectangle of a doorway ap- 
peared on his right — black in 
black — Otheym’s house, Fate’s 
house, a place different from the 
ones around it only in the role 

143 



Time had chosen for it. It was 
a strange place to be marked 

down in history. 

The door opened to his knock. 
The gap revealed the dull green 
light of an atrium. A dwarf peered 
out, ancient face on a child's 
body, an apparition prescience 

had never seen. 

“You’ve come then,” the ap- 
parition said. The dwarf stepped 
aside, no awe in his manner, 

merely the gloating of a slow 
smile. “Come in! Come in.” 

Paul hesitated. There’d been no 
dwarf in the vision, but all else 
remained identical. Visions could 
contain such disparities and still 
hold true to their original plunge 
into infinity. But the difference 
dared him to hope. He glanced 

back up the street at the creamy 
pearl glistening of his moon 
swimming out of jagged shadows. 
The moon haunted him. How did 
it fall? 

“Come in,” the dwarf insisted. 

Paul entered. He heard the door 
tluid into its moisture seals 
behind. The dwarf passed him, 
led the way, enormous feet slap- 
ping the floor, and opened the 
delicate lattice gate into the roofed 
central courtyard. He gestured. 
“They await. Sire.” 

Sire, Paul thought. He knows 
me, then. 

Before Paul could explore this 
discovery, the dwarf slipped away 
down a side passage. Hope was 
a dervish wind whirling, dancing 
in Paul. He headed across the 
courtyard. It was a dark and 
gloomy place, the smell of 
sickness and defeat in it. He felt 

144 



daunted by the atmosphere. Was 
it defeat to choose a lesser evil? 
How far down this track had he 
come? 

Light poured from a narrow 
doorway in the far wall. He put 
down the feeling of watchers and 
evil smells and entered the door- 
way into a small room. It was 
a barren place by Fremen stan- 
dards with heireg hangings on 
only two walls. Opposite the door, 
a man sat on carmine cushions 
beneath the best hanging. A fe- 
minine figure hovered in shadows 
behind another doorway in a bar- 
ren wall to the left. 

Paul felt vision-trapped. This 
was the way it had gone. Where 
was the dwarf? Where was the 
difference? 



H IS senses absorbed the room in 
a single gestalten sweep. The 
place had received painstaking 
care despite its poor furnishings. 
Hooks and rods across the barren 
walls showed where hangings had 
been removed. Pilgrims paid 
enormous prices for authentic 
Fremen artifacts, Paul reminded 
himself. Rich pilgrims counted 
desert tapestries as treasures, true 
marks of a hajj. 

Paul felt that the barren walls 
accused him with their fresh 
gypsum wash. The threadbare 
condition of the two remaining 
hangings amplified the sense of 
guilt. 

A narrow shelf occupied the 
wall on his right. It held a row 
of portraits — mostly bearded Fre- 
men, some in stillsuits with their 

GALAXY 



catchtubes dangling, some in Im- 
perial uniforms posed against ex- 
otic offworld backgrounds. The 
most common scene was a 
seascape. 

The Fremen on the cushions 
cleared his throat, forcing Paul 
to look at him. It was Otheym 
precisely as the vision had reveal- 
ed him — neck grown scrawny, a 
bird thing which appeared too 
weak to support the large head. 
The face was a lopsided 
ruin — networks of crisscrossed 
scars on the left cheek below 
a drooping, wet eye, but clear 
skin on the other side and a 
straight, blue-in-blue Fremen 
gaze. A long kedge of a nose 
bisected the face. 

Otheym’s cushions sat in the 
center of a threadbare rug, brown 
with maroon and gold threads. 
The cushion fabric betrayed 
splotches of wear and patching, 
but every bit of metal around the 
seated figure shone from 
polishing — the portrait frames, 
shelf lip and brackets, the pedestal 
of a low table on the right. 

Paul nodded to the clear half 
of Otheym’s face. “Good luck to 
you and your dwelling place.” It 
was the greeting of an old friend 
and sietch-mate. 

“So I see you once more, 
Usui.” 

The voice speaking his tribal 
name whined with an old man’s 
quavering. The dull drooping eye 
on the ruined side of the face 
moved above the parchment skin 
and scars. Gray bristles stubbled 
that side and the jawline there 
hung with scabrous peelings. 

DUNE MESSIAH 



Otheym's mouth twisted as he 
spoke, the gap exposing silvery 
metal teeth. 

“Muad’dib always answers the 
call of a Fedaykin,” Paul said. 

The woman in the doorway 
shadows moved. She said: “So 
Stilgar boasts.” 

She came forward into the light, 
an older version of the Lichna 
that the Face Dancer had copied. 
Paul recalled then that Otheym 
had married sisters. Her hair was 
gray, her nose grown witch sharp. 
Weaver’s callouses ran along her 
forefingers and thumbs. A Fremen 
woman would have displayed such 
marks proudly in the sietch days, 
but she saw his attention on her 
hands and hid them under a fold 
of her pale blue robe. 

Paul remembered her name 
then — Dhuri. The shock was that 
he remembered her as a child, 
not as she’d been in his vision 
of these moments. It was the 
whine that edged her voice, Paul 
told himself. She’d whined even 
as a child. 

“You see me here,” Paul said. 
“Would I be here if Stilgar hadn’t 
approved?” He turned toward 
Otheym. “I carry your water bur- 
den, Otheym. Command me.” 

This was the straight Fremen 
talk of sietch brothers. 



O THEYM produced a shaky nod, 
almost too much for that thin 
neck. He lifted a liver-marked left 
hand and pointed to the ruin of 
his face. “I caught the splitting 
disease on Tarahell, Usui,” he 
wheezed. “Right after the victory 

1 45 



when we’d all. A fit of 
coughing stopped his voice. 

“The tribe will collect his water 
soon,” Dhuri said. She crossed 
to Otheym, propped pillows 
behind him and held his shoulder 
to steady him until the coughing 
passed. She wasn’t really very old, 
Paul saw, but a look of lost hopes 
ringed her mouth and bitterness 
lay in her eyes. 

“I’ll summon doctors,” Paul 
said. 

Dhuri turned, hand on hip. 
“We’ve had medical men, as good 
as any you could summon.” She 
sent an involuntary glance to the 
barren wall on her left. 

And the medical men were 
costly, Paul thought. 

He felt edgy, constrained by 
the vision but aware that minor 
differences had crept in. How 
could be exploit the differences? 
Time came out of its skein with 
subtle changes, but the 
background "fabric held oppressive 
sameness. He knew with terrifying 
certainty that if he tried to break 
out of the enclosing pattern here, 
it would become a thing of terrible 
violence. The power in this 
deceptively gentle flow of Time 
oppressed him. 

“Say what you want of me,” 
he growled. 

“Couldn’t it be that Otheym 
needed a friend to stand by him 
in this time?” Dhuri asked. “Does 
a Fedaykin have to consign his 
flesh to strangers?” 

We shared Sietch Tabr, Paul 
reminded himself. She has the 
right to berate me for apparent 
callousness. 

146 



“What I can do I will do,” 
Paul said. 

Another fit of coughing shook 
Otheym. When it had passed, he 
gasped : “There’s treachery, 

Usui. Fremen plot against you.” 
His mouth worked then without 
sound. Spittle escaped his lips. 
Dhuri wiped his mouth with a 
corner of her robe, and Paul saw 
how her face betrayed anger at 
such waste of moisture. 

Frustrated rage threatened to 
overwhelm Paul then. That 
Otheym should be spent thus! A 
Fedaykin deserved belter. But no 
choice remained — not for a Death 
Commando or his Emperor. They 
walked Ockham’s razor in this 
room. The slightest misstep 
multiplied honors — not just for 
themselves, but for all humankind, 
even for those who would destroy 
them. 

Paul squeezed calmness into his 
mind. He looked at Dhuri. The 
expression of terrible longing with 
which she gazed at Otheym 
strengthened Paul. Chani must 
never look at me that way, he 
told himself. 

“Lichna spoke of a message,” 
Paul said. 

“My dwarf,” Otheym wheezed. 
“I bought him on. .on. .on a 
world. .1 forget. He’s a human 
distrans, a toy discarded by the 
Tleilaxu. He’s recorded all the 
names. .the traitors. .” 

Otheym fell silent, trembling. 

“You speak of Lichna,” Dhuri 
said. “When you arrived, we knew 
she’d reached you safely. If you’re 
thinking of this new burden 
Otheym places upon you, Lichna 

GALAXY 



is the sura of that burden. An 
even exchange, Usui. Take the 
dwarf and go.” 

Paul suppressed a shudder. He 
closed his eyes. Lichna! The real 
daughter had perished in the 
desert, a semuta - wracked body 
abandoned to the sand and the 
wind. 

Opening his eyes, Paul said: 
“You could have come to me at 
any time for. 

“Otheym stayed away that he 
might be numbered among those 
who hate you, Usui,” Dhuri said. 
“The house to the south of us 
at the end of the street, that is 
a gathering place for your foes. 
It’s why we took this hovel.” 

“Then summon the dwarf and 
we’ll leave,” Paul said. 

“You’ve not listened well,” 
Dhuri said. 

“You must take the dwarf to 
a safe place,” Otheym said, an 
odd strength in his voice. “He 
carries the only record of the 
traitors. No one suspects his 
talent. They think I keep him for 
amusement.” 

“We cannot leave,” Dhuri said. 
“Only you and the dwarf. It’s 
known. .how poor we are. We’ve 
said we’re selling the dwarf. 
They’ll take you for the buyer. 
It’s your only chance.” 

P AUL consulted his memory of 
the vision: in it, he’d left here 
with the names of the traitors, 
but never seeing how those names 
were carried. The dwarf obviously 
moved under the protection of 
another oracle. It occurred to Paul 
then that all creatures must carry 

DUNE MESSIAH 



some kind of destiny stamped out 
by purposes of varying strengths, 
by the fixatives of training and 
disposition. From the moment the 
Jihad had chosen him, he’d felt 
himself hemmed in by the forces 
of a multitude. Their fixed pur- 
poses demanded and controlled 
his course. Any delusions of Free 
Will he harbored now must be 
merely the prisoner rattling his 
cage. His curse lay in the fact 
that he saw the cage. He saw 
it! 

He listened now to the emp- 
tiness of this house. There were 
only the four of them in 
it — Dhuri, Otheym, the dwarf and 
himself. He inhaled the fear and 
tension of his companions, sensed 
the watchers — his own force 
hovering in ’thopters. 

I was wrong to hope, Paul 
thought. But thinking of hope 
brought him a twisted sense of 
hope, and he felt that he might 
yet seize his moment. 

“Summon the dwarf,” he said. 

“Bijaz!” Dhuri called. 

“You call me?” The dwarf 
stepped into the room from the 
courtyard, an alert expression of 
worry on his face. 

“You have a new master, Bi- 
jaz,” Dhuri said. She stared at 
Paul. “You may call him. .Usui.” 

“Usui, that’s the base of the 
pillar,” Bijaz said, translating. 
“How can Usui be base when 
I’m the basest thing living?” 

“He always speaks thus,” 
Otheym apologized. 

“I don’t speak,” Bijaz said. “I 
operate a machine called 
language. It creaks and groans.” 

147 



A Tleilaxu toy, learned and 
alert, Paul thought. The Bene 
Tleilax never threw away 
something this valuable. He turn- 
ed and studied the dwarf. Round 
melange eyes returned his stare. 

“What other talents have you, 
Bijaz?” Paul asked. 

“I know when we should 
leave,” Bijaz said. “It’s a talent 
few men have. There’s a time for 
endings — and that’s a good 
beginning; Let us begin to go, 
Usui.” 

Paul examined his vision 
memory — no dwarf, but the little 
man's words fitted the occasion. 

“At the door, you called me 
Sire,” Paul said. “You know me, 
then?” 

“You’ve sired, Sire,” Bijaz said, 
grinning. “You are much more 
than the base Usui. You're the 
Atreides Emperor, Paul Muad'dib. 
And you are my finger.” He held 
up the index finger of his right 
band. 

“Bijaz!” Dhuri snapped. “You 
tempt fate.” 

“I tempt my finger,” Bijaz pro- 
tested, voice squeaking. He 
pointed at Usui. “1 point at Usui. 
Is my finger not Usui himself? 
Or is it a reflection of something 
more base?” He brought the finger 
close to his eyes, examined it with 
a mocking grin, first one side then 
the other. “Ahhh, it’s merely a 
finger, after all.” 

“He often rattles on thus,” 
Dhuri said, worry in her voice. 
“I think it's why he was discarded 
by the Tleilaxu.” 

“I’ll not be patronized,” Bijaz 
said, “yet I have a new patron. 

148 



How strange the workings of the 
finger.” He peered at Dhuri and 
Otheyrn, eyes oddly bright. “A 
weak glue bound us, Otheyrn. A 
few tears and we part.” The 
dwarf’s big feet rasped on the 
floor as he whirled completely 
around and stopped facing Paul. 
“Ahhh, patron! I came the long 
way around to find you.” 

Paul nodded. 



OU’LL be kind, Usui?” Bijaz 
I asked. “I’m a person, you 
know. Persons come in many 
shapes and sizes. This be but one 
of them. I'm weak of muscle, but 
strong of mouth; cheap to feed, 
but costly to fill. Empty me as 
you will, there’s still more in me 
than men put there.” 

“We've no time for your stupid 
riddles,” Dhuri growled. “You 
should be gone.” 

“I’m riddled with conundrums,” 
Bijaz said, “but not all of them 
stupid. To be gone, Usui, is to 
be a bygone. Yes? Let us let 
bygones be bygones. Dhuri speaks 
truth, and I’ve the talent for hear- 
ing that, too.” 

“You’ve truthsense?” Paul ask- 
ed, determined now to wait out 
the clockwork of his vision. 
Anything was better than shat- 
tering these moments and produc- 
ing the new consequences. There 
remained things for Otheyrn to 
say lest Time be diverted into 
even more horrifying channels. 
“I’ve /tow-sense,” Bijaz said. 
Paul noted that the dwarf had 
growm more nervous. Was the lit- 
tle man aware of things about 

GALAXY 



to happen? Could Bijaz be his 
own oracle? 

‘'Did you inquire of Lichna?” 
Otheym asked suddenly, peering 
up at Dhuri with his good eye. 

“Lichna is safe,” Dhuri said. 

Paul lowered his head, lest his 
expression betray the lie. Safe! 
Lichna was ashes in a secret 
grave. 

“That’s good then,” Otheym 
said, taking Paul’s lowered head 
for a nod of agreement. “One 
good thing among the evils, Usui. 
I don’t like the world we’re mak- 
ing, you know that? It was better 
when we were alone in the desert 
with only the Harkonnens for 
enemy.” 

“There’s but a thin line between 
many an enemy and many a 
friend,” Bijaz said. “Where that 
line stops, there’s no beginning 
and no end. Let’s end it, my 
friends.” He moved to Paul’s side, 
jittered from one foot to the other. 

“What’s /tow-sense?” Paul ask- 
ed, dragging out these moments, 
goading the dwarf. 

“Now!” Bijaz said, trembling. 
“Now! Now!” He tugged at Paul’s 
robe. “Let us go now!” 

“His mouth rattles, but there’s 
no harm in him,” Otheym said, 
affection in his voice, the one 
good eye staring at Bijaz. 

“Even a rattle can signal 
departure,” Bijaz said. “And so 
can tears. Let’s be gone while 
there’s time to begin.” 

“Bijaz, what do you fear?” Paul 
asked. 

“I fear the spirit seeking me 
now,” Bijaz muttered. Perspira- 
tion stood out on his forehead. 



His cheeks twitched. “I fear the 
one who thinks not and will have 
no body except mine — and that 
one gone back into itself! I fear 
the things l see and the things 
I do not see.” 

This dwarf does possess the 
power of prescience, Paul thought. 
Bijaz shared the terrifying oracle. 
Did he share the oracle’s fate, 
as well? How potent was the 
dwarf’s power? Did he have the 
little prescience of those who 
dabbled in the Dune Tarot? Or 
was it something greater? How 
much had he seen? 

“Best you go,” Dhuri said. 
“Bijaz is right.” 

“Every minute we linger,” Bijaz 
said, “prolongs. .prolongs the 
present!” 

Every minute 1 linger defers 
my guilt, Paul thought. A worm’s 
poisonous breath, its teeth drip- 
ping dust, had washed over him. 
It had happened long ago, but 
he inhaled the memory of it 
now — spice and bitterness. He 
could sense his own worm wait- 
ing — “the urn of the desert.” 

“These are troubled times,” he 
said, addressing himself to 
Otheym’s judgment of their world. 

“Fremen know what to do in 
time of trouble,” Dhuri said. 

Otheym contributed a shaky 
nod. 

Paul glanced at Dhuri. He’d 
not expected gratitude, would 
have been burdened by it more 
than he could bear, but Otheym’s 
bitterness and the passionate 
resentment he saw in Dhuri’s eyes 
shook his resolve. Was anything 
worth this price? 



DUNE MESSIAH 



14 ? 



“Delay serves no purpose,” 
Dhuri said. 

“Do what you must, Usui,” 
Otheym wheezed. 

Paul sighed. The words of the 
vision had been spoken. “There’ll 
be an accounting,” he said, to 
complete it. Turning, he strode 
from the room. He heard Bijaz 
foot-slapping behind. 

“Bygones, bygones,” Bijaz 
muttered as they went. “Let 
bygones fall where they may. This 
has been a dirty day.” 



F IRST Moon stood high over the 
city as Paul, his shield activated 
and shimmering around him, 
emerged from the cul-de-sac. A 
wind off the massif whirled hot 
dust down the narrow street, 
causing Bijaz to blink and shield 
his eyes. 

“We must hurry,” the dwarf 
muttered. “Hurry! Hurry!” 

“You sense danger?” Paul ask- 
ed, probing. 

“I know danger!” 

An abrupt sense of peril very 
near was followed almost imme- 
diately by a figure joining them 
out of a doorway. 

Bijaz crouched and whimpered. 
It was only Stilgar moving like 
a war machine, head thrust for- 
ward, feet striking the street 
solidly. 

Swiftly, Paul explained the 
value of the dw'arf and handed 
Bijaz over to Stilgar. The pace 
of the vision moved here with 
great rapidity. Stilgar sped away 
with Bijaz. Security Guards en- 
veloped Paul. Orders were given 

150 



to send men down the street 
toward the house beyond 
Otheym’s. The men hurried to 
obey, shadows among silent shad- 
ows. 

“We want live prisoners,” one 
of the Guard officers snarled. 

The sound was a viscon-echo 
in Paul’s ears. It went with solid 
precision, vision matching reality, 
tick for tick. Ornithoptcrs drifted 
down across the moon. 

The night was full of Imperial 
troopers attacking. 

A soft hiss grew out of the 
other sounds, climbed to a roar 
while they still heard the sibilance. 
It picked up a terra cotta glow 
that hid the stars, engulfed the 
moon. 

Paul, knowing that sound and 
glow from the earliest nightmare 
glimpses of his vision, felt an odd 
sense of fulfillment. It went the 
way it must. 

“Stone burner!” The cry was 
all around him. “Stone bur- 

ner. .stone burner. .” 

Because it was required of him, 
Paul threw a protective arm 

across his face, dove for the low 
lip of a curb. It already was too 
late, of course. 

He knew it. 

Where Otheym’s house had 
been, there stood now a pillar 

of fire, a blinding jet roaring at 
the heavens. It gave off a dirty 
brilliance which threw into sharp 
relief every ballet movement of 

the diving crowd. 

For every member of this frantic 
throng it was too late.

WILLY LEY 



The First Citizen of the Mcon 



The world of science fiction has 
just lost its most important citizen. 
And — if histories are written by 
men of understanding — it may 
some day be realized that world 
has lost one of its singularly great 
leaders, surely a fact not readily 
apparent to some during his life. 
Willy Ley died of a sudden heart 
attack on June 24, 1969. 

1 cannot write a standard 
obituary for a man who stood 
high in my affection and regard 
for thirty years. It is the evening 
before his funeral as I type this

Willy was a contributor for almost 
half of his adult life. 

This issue marks the end of the 
nineteenth full year during which 
his column For Your Information 
has appeared. It is without ques- 
tion a record for the longest series 
of continuous contributions to any 
science-fiction magazine by other 
than the editor. 

Other records were set by him 
in the past. In the fifteen years 
between his arrival in this country 
and his first article for Galaxy he 
contributed to at least 90 issues of 
various science-fiction magazines, 
doing articles that found regular 
publication at a time when such 
science articles were far less in 
demand than they are today.

Out of the twenty-seven men 
who have been picked as guests of 
honor at World Science Fiction 
Conventions, Willy Ley was the 
only one whose reputation was 
based upon the writing of nonfic- 
tion. This was in 1953, at the 
second Convention held in Phila- 
delphia. Looking back, 1 realize 
now that no one bothered 
to comment on the distinction, 
probably because Willy was au- 
tomatically accepted by readers 
and fellow writers as one who was 
not limited by any category. 

His, choice of nonfiction was 
certainly not dictated by any lack 
of ability to handle fiction. He 
proved this by the few pieces of 
pure fiction he wrote under the 
name of Robert Willey — a pen- 
name meant to separate fiction 
from fact, not to conceal his iden- 
tity. F. Orlin Tremaine blurbtd 
his At the Perihelion as a "great 
science fiction novel” and gave it 
the cover, despite the seeming 
obscurity of the name. And his 
Fog was a piece of mood writing 
that proved to have a lasting effect 
in a strange way. 

Fog was a story of the utter 
confusion and dark mood of what 
real revolution means to those 
who see it without being able to 
know exactly what they are 
seeing. Two years later 1 did a 
story in which I tried to capture 
some of the same elements of 
suspense in a different way at the 
request of the editor — the story 



was Nerves and may be the best I 
ever wrote. Theodore Sturgeon 
told me years later that his 
Killdozer was a second derivation. 
How far the chain went 1 do not 
know. 

Willy's influence on the entire 
stream of science fiction was far 
stronger than this, however. His 
popular books and articles on the 
hard facts of rockets, orbits and 
space travel established the basic 
handling of such subjects. Writers 
who never read any of his early 
books on rocketry derived most of 
their facts from him through the 
stories by men who had studied 
his writings. 

In time his reputation spread 
far beyond any genre. Men who 
would never read science fic- 
tion — or indeed anything except 
the tabloid newspapers — were im- 
pressed by his byline. 1 know 
from personal experience that the 
fact that one knew Willy Ley was 
a unique testament to one’s 
respectability. 

Willy never let his stature 
bother him. From the time I read 
his first fan letter in an American 
science-fiction magazine until the 
last time 1 saw him, he took it for 
granted that the writers a n d 
readers of science fiction were 
somehow his real family, l ie was 
always ready to respond to a re- 
quest for an appearance at a fan 
conclave when his schedule per- 
mitted and he was often one of the 
first men I met at the annual 



152 



CREDO 



World Science Fiction Conven- 
tions. 

But his real importance lay 
beyond any realm of fiction. I said 
at the beginning that he was our 
most important citizen but I did 
not mean to indicate that he was 
our greatest writer. His role in the 
field of science fiction was beyond 
that. 

John W. Campbell summed it 
up in one way when he said, 
“Most of us dream about the 
future and some of us write about 
our dreams. But Willy Ley did 
something about his.” 

He took what must be the very 
basic dream with which science 
fiction began — the desire that man 
should get off a single planet and 
spread his seed throughout the 
heavens. And more than any other 
man, often by the least obvious 
means, he built that dream into 
reality. 

W ILLY LEY was born in Oc- 
tober, 1906, in Berlin. He was 
educated in general science of the 
day, with particular emphasis on 
zoology. Anyone who has read his 
books on the strange animal life 
of earth, such as The Lungjish, 
the Dodo and the Unicorn, or his 
numerous articles in this maga- 
zine, must be aware of his never- 
failing interest and his ability. Had 
he continued his studies he might 
have become a zoologist of note. 
But he quit before winning his 
degree. (He did receive an 



Honorary Doctorate from Adelphi 
University in 1960.) 

He had discovered a little, book 
full of obscure mathematical proof 
that rockets had the ability to 
reach the moon. This was printed 
in 1923 and was the work by 
Hermann Oberth. It had caused 
some flurry of argument among 
scientists and engineers, few of 
whom accepted it, but it was far 
beyond the grasp of the average 
man. 

Willy decided it had to be made 
available to all. And shortly 
before he was twenty, he wrote a 
book without mathematics to tell 
the story to the world. When it 
was published it did what he 
wanted. Men who could share in 
the dream of the conquest of 
space suddenly found a reason to 
believe it was possible. As Willy 
had suspected, where the learned 
men of the day were content to 
argue, the less pedantic 
enthusiasts began to scheme and 
plan to do something about 
Oberth’s message. 

The impetus of Willy’s first 
book, Die Fahrt im Weltall 
(Journey into Space), brought a 
group of men to join him in 
organizing the German Rocket 
Society ( Verin fiir Raumschif- 
fahrt) in 1927. 

Work had been done on rockets 
and their theory before. I n 
America, Goddard had experi- 
mented with liquid fuels and had 
written a brief paper on high- 

153 



CREDO 



altitude rockets for use in weather 
observations. In Russia, 
Tsiolkovsky had spent years 
working out detailed plans. But 
these had languished without at- 
tention. 

The VfR, as it was known, 
began to accumulate funds for 
research. They used every means 
to scrape together enough to build 
crude models and to find a testing 
ground. Willy took on the thank- 
less task of getting out the bulle- 
tins of the VfR through which 
members — who eventually includ- 
ed a rocket tyro named Werner 
von Braun, were recruited and 
funds solicited. He arranged for 
the German film company produc- 
ing Fritz Lang’s Frau im Monel to 
agree to contribute to the VfR in 
return for advice and a public de- 
monstration of a rocket. And he 
gave himself the task of keeping 
things moving during the difficult 
years when highly independent 
and willful men often disagreed 
violently. He spoke casually about 
one of his darkest periods: “In 
order to raise money, I went on a 
lecture tour.” He was then twenty- 
five years old and branded by 
many as a crackpot for fooling 
with what sane men knew was 
nonsense— but he never made an 
issue of the difficulties and 
derision he faced on his tour. 

Unlike most hobby groups, 
the VfR actually did valuable 
research. They built and tested 
rocket motors, and they learned 



the necessary hard lessons. Willy 
contributed the suggestion that 
they switch from gasoline to 
alcohol and water to burn with 
their liquid oxygen— and for the 
first time the pioneers had a 
self-cooling motor — as all later 
rockets did. He also discovered 
how much water should be mixed 
with the alcohol for proper 
cooling. Eventually the VfR pro- 
duced a working prototype of a 
motor that has remained basically 
the same ever since. This spelled 
some five years of research by a 
group of enthusiasts with limited 
funds. 

B Y 1933 Willy began to realize 
he could no longer stay in Hit- 
ler’s Germany. Count Wernher 
von Braun had been drafted from 
the VfR to the military develop- 
ment of rockets, after learning the 
hard lessons from the work at the 
VfR testing field. As events prov- 
ed, von Braun was a single- 
minded genius who let no con- 
siderations stand in the way of his 
doing the one thing he could do 
better than anyone else. 

But Willy was not the type of 
man who could sacrifice in any 
way his basic humanity for expe- 
diency — even for the sake of the 
dream that dominated his life. 
Without question the future of 
rockets — in the early thirties — lay 
in Germany; but too many other 
things also lurked in the dark 
future of that Germany.

CREDO 



Willy reached America in 1935. 
There he tried briefly to carry on 
with the American Rocket Society 
but their work seemed pure hobby 
stuff to him after the serious ef- 
forts of the VfR. 

I met him first thirty years ago, 
when his dream of space seemed 
farthest from its goal. The U.S., 
whose citizen he became in 1944, 
was at war with Germany and 
Willy was still a resident alien, 
somewhat suspect and restricted, 
however well he had proved his 
loyalty to the principles for which 
he fought. We talked of many 
things, from multilingual jokes to 
a Van Vogt novel. 

He was a big man — not so 
much in height as in impression of 
hugeness and massive solidity. 
And the deep voice that came out 
was a growl that made him seem a 
bear in human form. His English 
was not quite colloquial then, 
though his vocabulary and un- 
derstanding of grammar had been 
extraordinary even before he came 
here. He evidenced no sign of 
harshness or bitter feelings. He 
was a warm and comfortable man. 

And he talked of rockets and of 
what could be done. Whenever he 
could, he still wrote articles on the 
subject to prepare the general 
public for what he felt they must 
begin after the shooting was over. 

For a brief time after -the war it 
seemed that his hopes would reach 
fruition. The U.S. had recovered a 
stock of the V-2 rockets which 



von Braun had developed from 
their origins at the VfR. The en- 
tire crew from Peenem nde under 
von Braun had surrendered to the 
Americans. We tested the rockets 
and we began building our own 
Viking. Willy was busy with lec- 
tures and consultations. 

For a time he seemed headed 
again for actual work with 
rockets. His contract with Galaxy 
even had an escape clause permit- 
ting him to quit if he were called 
to rocket duty. But his inability to 
agree with any man whom he 
knew to be either wrong or foolish 
kept him from the good graces of 
some who had discovered rockets 
in 1946 and were now trying to be 
experts. 

H E CONTINUED lecturing and 
writing and preparing the pub- 
lic. And then the boom in rocketry 
collapsed. The dark days follow- 
ing 1950 saw endless restrictions 
on research. Military rockets were 
not big enough to carry the pro- 
jected H-bombs, it was felt, so 
they were moved aside for more 
and bigger bombers. Space was 
something we meant to explore 
some day, of course — but there 
was time for that when the cold 
war ended. And if we went into 
space, it couldn’t be with one of 
von Braun’s war rockets. (Von 
Braun was then well along in his 
design of today’s Saturn booster.) 
Ours would have to be a “peace” 
rocket. ;

Willy sighed softly once in a 
while when I met him in the com- 
pany of a small group that met at 
the home of Fletcher Pratt. But 
usually he did not let his disap- 
pointments hide the conviviality 
that was so much a part of him. 
He was perhaps the most cheerful 
of all at the old science-fiction 
Hydra Club among fans and pro- 
fessionals. 

And he went on working. He 
lectured, he wrote books. His man- 
ual on rocketry first came out in 
1944 as Rockets and has been in 
continuous printings under various 
names since then. It is currently 
Rockets, Missiles and Men in 
Space and has probably given un- 
derstanding of space travel to 
more men than any dozen other 
books. He collaborated with von 
Braun on a series of articles for 
Collier’s that did more to convince 
the public of the possibility of 
space travel than anything else. 
And he acted as an advisor to 
Walt Disney to get his message 
across. 

Then came Sputnik. Willy had 
known of the plans to send up one 
of von Braun’s military rockets 
with a small canister at least a 
year ahead of the Russians and of 
its cancellation because of inter- 
service nonsense. He shrugged and 
went cheerfully on television to 
calm and explain and offer hope. 

The point I’m making is that 
Willy lived. He lived more in time 
with his days — and the world’s 

156 



tomorrows — than most men. He 
was more than a prophet without 
honor. Events did not pass him 
by. Rather, he shaped them. 

The work done at the VfR 
would have been impossible with- 
out him. And while vague other 
signs of some interest in rocketry 
existed, nothing so shaped the ma- 
turity of the space age. The VfR 
took an idea and made it into en- 
gineering practice, enabling von 
Braun to enlarge it and demon- 
strate it over London. 

It was largely Willy’s work that 
killed the public antipathy to 
rockets after their use as a terror 
weapon and began to make people 
dream of space again. When Ken- 
nedy proposed the race to the 
moon he mentioned huge sums 
required to finance it. The cost 
was more than had ever been 
spent on a science project. Yet 
when public polls were taken, jt 
turned out that the people were 
willing to support our space ven- 
ture — and not just for national 
prestige. Somehow, through all his 
articles, Willy and those who were 
converted by him had managed to 
convince half of the nation that 
there was value enough in the 
space program for them to go 
along with the huge expenditure. 

Willy Ley had quietly deter- 
mined before he was twenty years 
of age that men should set foot on 
the Moon during his lifetime. And 
step by step, he led them to turn 
their eyes from this single planet 

CREDO 



to the vast reaches of space. 

It took him forty years and he 
missed his goal of seeing the first 
man on the moon by a month. But 
there is precedent for that.

plains of Moah unto the moun- 
tain. .And the Lord showed him

announced that the Roseau 
satellite would be shipped to the 
Russian space center at Baikonur, 
to be launched by a Russian 
rocket. Expected launch date is 
November, 1971. 

The Europeans seem to have 
revamped quite a number of pro- 
grams late in 1968. ESRO decid- 
ed that the TD1 satellite should 
be taken out of the regular 
schedule and be made a special 
project. Scheduled launch date for 
that satellite is March, 1972. The 
TDl satellite is an astronomical 
satellite like the American OAO 
(Orbiting Astronomical Obser- 
vatory), the second of which was 
put into orbit on December 7, 
1968. (The first OAO was suc- 



cessfully orbited on April 8, 1966, 
but a malfunction of the power 
supply rendered it useless.) De- 
tails of the design of TD 1 have 
not yet been released. Presumably 
the design is still what is called 
fluid, meaning undecided. 

At the same time ELDO decid- 
ed to discontinue a satellite 
development called Vempa. The 
French and West German govern- 
ments immediately signed a con- 
tract for a continuation of Vempa 
between them. Junkers in Ger- 
many had started development of 
the payload for ELDO and will 
now reshape it for the German 
government. The French have 
promised to orbit it with the larger 
version of the Dianmut rocket. 
No launch date has been set. •
