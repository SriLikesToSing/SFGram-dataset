become a man. 

But will the world stay peaceful? 
That depends on whether we can keep 
the peace. Peace costs money. 

Money for military strength and 



for science. And money saved by 
individuals to help keep our economy 
strong.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid - 
den processes of man's mind t and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

3UWUH3IN 



The creatures on 
the little planet 
were real bafflers. 
The first puzzler 
about them was that 
they died so easily. 
The second was that 
they didn't die at all. 



I 

T ENSION eased away as 
the spaceship settled 
down on its metallic haunch- 
es and they savored a safe 
planetfall. 

Ekstrohm fingered loose 
the cinches of his decelera- 
tion couch. He sighed. An 
exploration camp would mean 
things would be simpler for 
him. He could hide his prob- 
lem from the others more eas- 
ily. Trying to keep secret 
what he did alone at night 





was very difficult under the 
close conditions on board a 
ship in space. 

Ryan hefted his bulk up 
and supported it on one el- 
bow. He rubbed his eyes 
sleepily with one huge paw. 
“Ekstrohm, Nogol, you guys 
okay?” 

“Nothing wrong with me 
that couldn’t be cured,” No- 
gol said. He didn’t say what 
would cure him; he had been 
explaining all during the trip 
what he needed to make him 
feel like himself. His small 
black eyes darted inside the 
olive oval of his face. 

“Ekstrohm?” Ryan insist- 
ed. 

“Okay.” 

“Well, let’s take a ground- 
level look at the country 
around here.” 

The facsiport rolled open 
on the landscape. A range 
of bluffs hugged the horizon, 
the color of decaying moss. 
Above them, the sky was the 
black of space, or the almost 
equal black of the winter sky 
above Minneapolis, seen 
against neon-lit snow. That 
cold, empty sky was full of 
fire and light. It seemed al- 
most a magnification of the 
Galaxy itself, of the Milky 
Way, blown up by some mas- 
ter photographer. 

This fiery swath was ac- 
tually only a belt of minor 
planets, almost like the aste- 
roid belt in the original So- 
lar System. These planets 
were much bigger, nearly all 



capable of holding an at- 
mosphere. But to the infuri- 
ation of scientists, for no 
known reason not all of them 
did. This would be the fifth 
mapping expedition to the 
planetoids of Yancy-6 in 
three generations. They lay 
months away from the near- 
est Earth star by jump drive, 
and no one knew what they 
were good for, although it 
was felt that they would 
probably be good for some- 
thing if it could only be dis- 
covered — much like the con- 
tinent of Antarctica in an- 
cient history. 

“How can a planet with so 
many neighbors be so lone- 
ly?” Ryan asked. He was the 
captain, so he could ask ques- 
tions like that. 

“Some can be lonely in a 
crowd,” Nogol said elaborat- 
ely. 

66 \V THAT will we need out- 

W side, Ryan?” Ek- 
strohm asked. 

“No helmets,” the captain 
answered. “We can breathe 
out there, all right. It just 
won’t be easy. This old world 
lost all of its helium and 
trace gases long ago. Nitro- 
gen and oxygen are about it.” 

“Ryan, look over there,” 
Nogol said. “Animals. Ring- 
ing the ship. Think they’re in- 
telligent, maybe hostile?” 

“I think they’re dead,” Ek- 
strohm interjected quietly. 
“I get no readings from them 
at all. Sonic, electronic, gal-

vanic — all blank. According 
to these needles, they’re stone 
dead.” 

“Ekstrohm, you and I will 
have a look,” Ryan said. “You 
hold down the fort, Nogol. 
Take it easy.” 

“Easy,” Nogol confirmed. 
“I heard a story once about 
a rookie who got excited when 
the captain stepped outside 
and he couldn’t get an en- 
cephalographic reading on 
him. Me, I know the mind of 
an officer works in a strange 
and unfathomable manner.” 
“I’m not worried about 
you mis-reading the dials, No- 
gol, just about a lug like you 
reading them at all. Remem- 
ber, when the little hand is 
straight up that’s negative. 
Positive results start when it 
goes towards the hand you 
use to make your mark.” 
“But I’m ambidextrous.” 
Ryan told him what he 
could do then. 

Ekstrohm smiled, and fol- 
lowed the captain through the 
airlock with only a glance at 
the lapel gauge on his cover- 
all. The strong negative 
field his suit set up would 
help to repel bacteria and in- 
sects. 

Actually, the types of in- 
fection that could attack a 
warm-blooded mammal were 
not infinite, and over the 
course of the last few hun- 
dred years adequate defenses 
had been found for all basic 
categories. He wasn’t likely 
to come down with hot chills 



and puzzling striped fever. 

They ignored the ladder 
down to the planet surface 
and, with only a glance at 
the seismological gauge to 
judge surface resistance, 
dropped to the ground. 

It was day, but in the thin 
atmosphere contrasts were 
sharp between light and sha- 
dow. They walked from mid- 
night to noon, noon to mid- 
night, and came to the beast 
sprawled on its side. 

Ekstrohm nudged it with a 
boot. “Hey, this is pretty 
close to a wart-hog.” 

“Uh-huh,” Ryan admitted. 
“One of the best matches I’ve 
ever found. Well, it has to 
happen. Statistical average 
and all. Still, it sometimes 
gives you a creepy feeling to 
find a rabbit or a snapping 
turtle on some strange world. 
It makes you wonder if this 
exploration business isn’t all 
some big joke, and somebody 
has been everywhere before 
you even started.” 

T HE surveyor looked side- 
wise at the captain. The 
big man seldom gave out with 
such thoughts. Ekstrohm 
cleared his throat. “What 
shall we do with this one? 
Dissect it?” 

Ryan nudged it with his 
toe, following Ekstrohm’s ex- 
ample. “I don’t know, Stor- 
my. It sure as hell doesn’t 
look like any dominant intel- 
ligent species to me. No 
hands, for one thing. Of

course, that’s not definite 
proof.” 

“No, it isn’t,” Ekstrohm 
said. 

“I think we’d better let it 
lay until we get a clearer pic- 
ture of the ecological setup 
around here. In the mean- 
time, we might be thinking 
on the problem all these dead 
beasts represent. What kill- 
ed them?” 

“It looks like we did, when 
we made blastdown.” 

“But what about our land- 
ing was lethal to the crea- 
tures?” 

“Radiation?” Ekstrohm 
suggested. “The planet is 
very low in radiation from 
mineral deposits, and the at- 
mosphere seems to shield out 
most of the solar output. Any 
little dose of radiation might 
knock off these critters.” 

“I don’t know about that. 
Maybe it would work the 
other way. Maybe because 
they have had virtually no 
radioactive exposure and don’t 
have any R’s stored up they 
could take a lot without 
harm.” 

“Then maybe it was the 
shockwave we set up. Or may- 
be it’s sheer xenophobia. They 
curl up and die at the sight 
of something strange and 
alien — like a (spaceship.” 

“Maybe,” the captain ad- 
mitted. “At this stage of the 
game anything could be pos- 
sible. But there’s one possi- 
bility I particularly don’t 
like.” 



“And that is?” 

“Suppose it was not us that 
killed these aliens. Suppose 
it is something right on the 
planet, native to it. I just 
hope it doesn’t work ort 
Earthmen too. These critters 
went real sudden.” 

E kstrohm lay in his 

bunk and thought, the 
camp is quiet. 

The Earthmen made camp 
outside the spaceship. There 
was no reason to leave the 
comfortable quarters inside 
the ship, except that, faced 
with a possibility of sleeping 
on solid ground, they simply, 
had to get out. 

The c^mp was a cluster of 
aluminum bubbles, ringed 
with a spy web to alert the 
Earthmen to the approach of 
any being. 

Each manjiad a bubble to 
himself, privacy after the 
long period of enforced inti- 
macy on board the ship. 

Ekstrohm lay in his bunk 
and listened to the sounds of 
the night on Yancy-6 138. 
There was a keening of wind, 
and a cracking of the frozeii 
ground. Insects there were 
on the world, but they were 
frozen solid during the night, 
only to revive and thaw in 
the morning sun.. 

The bunk he lay on was 
much more uncomfortable 
than the acceleration couches 
on board. Yet he knew the 
others were sleeping more 
soundly, now that they had 



THE PLANET WITH NO NIGHTMARE

renewed their contact with 
the matter that had birthed 
them to send them riding 
high vacuum. 

Ekstrohm was not asleep. 

Now there could be an end 
to pretending. 

He threw off the light 
blanket and swung his feet 
off the bunk, to the floor. Ek- 
strohm stood up. 

There was no longer any 
need to hide. But what was 
there to do? What had chang- 
ed for him? 

He no longer had to lie in 
his bunk all night, his eyes 
closed, pretending to sleep. 
In privacy he could walk 
around, leave the light on, 
read. 

It was small comfort for in- 
somnia. 

Ekstrohm never slept. Some 
doctors had informed him he 
was mistaken about this. Ac- 
tually, they said, he did sleep, 
but so shortly and fitfully 
that he forgot. Others ad- 
mitted he was absolutely cor- 
rect — he never slept. His 
body processes only slowed 
down enough for him to dis- 
pell fatigue poisons. Occa- 
sionally he fell into a waking, 
gritty-eyed stupor ; but he 
never slept. 

Never at all. 

Naturally, he couldn’t let 
his shipmates know this. In- 
somnia would ground him 
from the Exploration Service, 
on physiological if not psy- 
chological grounds. He had to 
hide it. 



O VER the years, he had 
had buddies in space in 
whom he thought he could 
confide. The buddies invari- 
ably took advantage of him. 
Since he couldn’t sleep any- 
way, he might as well stand 
their watches for them or 
write their reports. Where 
the hell did he get off threat- 
ening to report any laxness 
on their part to the captain? 
A man with insomnia had bet- 
ter avoid bad dreams of that 
kind if he knew what was 
good for him. 

Ekstrohm had to hide his 
secret. 

In a camp, instead of ship- 
board, hiding the secret was 
easier. But the secret itself 
was just as hard. 

Ekstrohm picked up a 
lightweight no-back from the 
ship’s library, a book by 
Bloch, the famous twentieth 
century expert on sex. He 
scanned a few lines on the 
social repercussions of a cel- 
ebrated nineteenth century 
sex murderer, but he couldn’t 
seem to concentrate on the 
weighty, pontifical, ponderous 
style. 

On impulse, he flipped up 
the heat control on his cover- 
all and slid back the hatch of 
the bubble. 

Ekstrohm walked through 
the alien glass and looked up 
at the unfamiliar constella- 
tions, smelling the frozen 
sterility of the thin air. 

Behind him, his mates stir- 
red without waking.

“L wasn’t planning on

have to jump me the first

“Look, Ekstrohm, do you

cided you did it to bedevil 
me? I’ve been up for hours — 
thinking — looking into this. 
You’re the only possibility 
that’s left.” 

“Why?” 

W^piIE bodies are missing. 

A What could it be? Sca- 
vengers? The web gives us a 
complete census on every- 
thing inside it. The only ani- 
mals inside the ring are more 
wart-hogs and despite their 
appearance, they aren’t car- 
nivorous. Strictly grass-eat- 
ers. Besides, no animal, no in- 
sect, no process of decay 
could completely consume ani- 
mals without a trace. There 
are no bones, no hide, no 
nothing.” 

“You don’t know the way 
bacteria works on this planet. 
Radiation is so low, it may 
be particularly virulent.” 
“That’s a possible explana- 
tion, although it runs counter 
to all the evidence we’ve es- 
tablished so far. There’s a 
much simpler explanation, 

12 



Ekstrohm. You. You hid the 
bodies for some reason. What 
other reason could you have 
for prowling around out here 
at night?” 

I couldn't sleep. The words 
were in his throat, but he 
didn’t use them. They weren’t 
an explanation. They would 
open more questions than 
they would answer. 

“You’re closing your eyes 
to the possibility of natural 
phenomenon, laying this 1 op 
me. You haven’t adequate 
proof and you know it.” 

“Ekstrohm, when some- 
thing’s stolen, you always sus- 
pect a suspicious character 
before you get around to the 
possibility that the stolen 
goods melted into thin air.” 

“What,” Ekstrohm said 
with deadly patience, “what 
do you think I could have 
possibly done with your preci- 
ous dead bodies?” 

“You could have buried 
them. This is a big territory. 
We haven’t been able to 
search every square foot of 
it.” 

“Ryan, it was thirty or for- 
ty below zero last night. How 
the devil could I dig holes in 
this ground to bury any- 
thing?” 

“At forty below, how could 
your bacteria function to rot 
them away?” 

Ekstrohm could see he was 
facing prejudice. There was 
no need to keep talking, apd 
no use in it. Still, some re- 
flex made him continue to 



JIM HARMON 




frame reasonable answers. 

“I don’t know what bac- 
teria on this planet can do. 
Besides, that was only one ex- 
ample of a natural phenome- 
non.” 

“Look, Ekstrohm, you don’t 
have anything to worry about 
if you’re not responsible. 
We’re going to give you a 
fair test.” 

What kind of a test would 
it be? He wondered. And 
how fair? 

Nogol came trotting up 
lightly. 

“Ryan, I found some more 
wart-hogs and they keeled 
over as soon as they saw me.” 

“So it was xenophobia,” 
Ekstrohm ventured. 

“The important thing,” 
Ryan said, with a sidelong 
glance at the surveyor, “is 
that now we’ve got what it 
takes to see if Ekstrohm has 
been deliberately sabotaging 
this expedition.” 

T HE body heat of the three 
men caused the air-con- 
ditioner of the tiny bubble to 
labor. 

“Okay,” Ryan breathed. 
“We’ve got our eyes on you, 
Ekstrohm, and the video cir- 
cuits are wide open on the 
dead beasts. All we have to 
do is wait.” 

“We’ll have a long wait,” 
Nogol ventured. “With Ek- 
strohm here, and the corpses 
out there, nothing is going to 
happen.” 

That would be all the proof 



they needed, Ekstrohm knew. 
Negative results would be 
positive proof to them. His 
pink ticket would turn pure 
red and he would be grounded 
for life — if he got off without 
a rehabilitation sentence. 

But if nothing happened, 
it wouldn’t really prove any- 
thing. There was no way to 
say that the conditions to- 
night were identical to the 
conditions the previous night. 
What had swept away those 
bodies might be comparable 
to a flash flood. Something 
that occurred once a year, or 
once in a century. 

And perhaps his presence 
outside was required in some 
subtle cause-and-effect rela- 
tionship. 

All this test would prove, 
if the bodies didn’t disappear, 
was only that conditions were 
not identical to conditions un- 
der which they did disappear. 

Ryan and Nogol were pre- 
pared to accept him, Ek- 
strohm, as the missing ele- 
ment, the one ingredient 
needed to vanish the corpses. 
But it could very well be 
something else. 

Only Ekstrohm knew that 
it had to be something else 
that caused the disappear- 
ances. 

Or did it? 

He faced up to the ques- 
tion. How did he know he 
was sane? How could hexbe 
sure that he hadn’t stolen 
and hid the bodies for some 
murky reason of his own? 

13 



THE PLANET WITH NO NIGHTMARE 




There was a large question as 
to how long a man could go 
without sleep, dreams and ob- 
livion, and remain sane, 

Ekstrohm forced his mind 
to consider the possibility. 
Could he remember every step 
he had taken the night be- 
fore? 

It seemed to him that he 
could remember walking past 
the creature lying in the 
grass, then walking in a cir- 
cle, and coming back to the 
base. It seemed like that to 
him. But how could he know 
that it was true? 

He couldn’t. 

T HERE was no way he 
could prove, even to him- 
self, that he had not dispos- 
ed of those alien remains 
and then come back to his 
bubble, contented and happy 
at the thought* of fooling 
those smug idiots who could 
sleep at night. 

“How much longer do we 
have to wait?” Nogol asked. 
“We’ve been here nine hours. 
Half a day. The bodies are 
right where I left them out- 
side. There doesn’t seem to 
be any more question.” 

Ekstrohm frowned. There 
was one question. He was 
sure there was one question 
. Oh, yes. The question 
was: How did he know he 
was sane? 

He didn’t know, of course. 
That was as good an answer 
as any. Might as well accept 
it; might as well let them do 

14 



what they wanted with him. 
Maybe if he just gave up, 
gave in, maybe he could sleep 
then. Maybe he could. 

Ekstrohm sat upright in 
his chair. 

No. That wasn’t the an- 
swer. He couldn’t know that 
he was sane, but then neither 
could anybody else. The point 
was, you had to go ahead liv- 
ing as if you were sane. That 
was the only way of living. 

“Cosmos,” Ryan gasped. 
“Would you look at that!” 

Ekstrohm followed the 
staring gaze of the two men. 

On the video grid, one of 
the “dead” animals was slow- 
ly rising, getting up, walking 
away. 

“A natural phenomenon !” 
Ekstrohm said. 

“Suspended animation !” 
Nogol ventured. 

“Playing possum!” Ryan 
concluded. 

Now came the time for 
apologies. 

Ekstrohm had been 
through similar situations be- 
fore, ever since he had been 
found walking the corridors 
at college the night one of the 
girls had been attacked. He 
didn’t want to hear their apo- 
logies ; they meant nothing to 
him. It was not a matter of 
forgiving them. He knew the 
situation had not changed. 

They would suspect him 
just as quickly a second time. 

“We’re supposed to be an 
exploration team,” Ekstrohm 
said quickly. “Let’s get down 

JIM HARMON 




to business. Why do you sup- 
pose these alien creatures 
fake death?” 

Nogol shrugged his wiry 
shoulders. “Playing dead is 
easier than fighting.” 

“More likely it’s a method 
of fighting,” Ryan suggested. 
“They play dead until they 
see an opening. The n — 
ripppp.” 

“I think they’re trying to 
hide some secret,” Ekstrohm 
said. 

“What secret?” Ryan de- 
manded. 

“I don't know,” he answer- 
ed. “Maybe I’d better — sleep 
on it.” 

Ill 

R YAN observed his two 
crewmen confidently the 
next morning. “I did some 
thinking last night.” 

Great, Ekstrohm thought. 
For that you should get a Ha- 
zardous Duty bonus. 

“This business is pretty 
simple,” the captain went on, 
“these pigs simply play pos- 
sum. They go into a state of 
suspended animation, when 
faced by a strange situation. 
Xenophobia ! I don’t see 
there’s much more to it.” 
“Well, if you don’t see that 
there’s more to it, Ryan — ” 
Nogol began complacently. 

“Wait a minute,” Ekstrohm 
interjected. “That’s a good 
theory. It may even be the 
correct one, but where’s your 
proof?” 

16 



“Look, Stormy, we don’t 
have to have proof. Hell, we 
don’t even have to have theo- 
ries. We’re explorers. We 
just make reports of primary 
evidence and let the scientists 
back home in the System fig- 
ure them out.” 

“I want this thing cleared 
up, Ryan. Yesterday, you 
were accusing me of being 
some kind of psycho who was 
lousing up the expedition out 
of pure — pure — ” he searched 
for a term currently in use in 
mentology — “demonia. May- 
be the boys back home will 
think the same thing. I want 
to be cleared.” 

“I guess you were cleared 
last night, Stormy boy,” No- 
gol put in. “We saw one of 
the ‘dead’ pigs get up and 
walk away.” 

‘‘That didn’t clear me,” Ek- 
strohm said. 

The other two looked like 
they had caught him clean- 
ing wax out of his ear in pub- 
lic. 

“No,” Ekstrohm went on. 
“We still have no proof of 
what caused the suspended 
animation of the pigs. What- 
ever caused it before caused 
it last night. You thought of 
accusing me, but you didn’t 
think it through about how I 
could have disposed of the 
bodies. Or, after you found 
out about the psuedo-death, 
how I might have caused that. 
If I had some drug or some- 
thing to cause it the first time, 
I could have a smaller dose, 

JIM HARMON 




or a slowly dissolving capsule 
for delayed effect.” 

The two men stared at him, 
their eyes beginning to nar- 
row. 

4< I could have done that. Or 
either of you could, have done 
the same thing” 

“Me?” N o g o 1 protested. 
“Where would my profit be 
in that?” 

“You both have an admit- 
ted motive. You hate my guts. 
I’m ‘strange,’ ‘different,’ ‘sus- 
picious.’ You could be trying 
to frame me.” 

“That’s insubordination,” 
Ryan grated. “Accusations 
against a superior officer. .” 
“Come off it, Ryan,” Nogol 
sighed. “I never saw a three- 
man spaceship that was run 
very taut. Besides, he’s 
right.” 

Beet-juice flowed out of 
Ryan’s swollen face. “So 
where does that leave us?” 
“Looking for proof of the 
cause of the pig’s pseudo- 
death. Remember, I’ll have 
to make counter-accusations 
against you two out of self- 
defense.” 

“Be reasonable. Stormy,” 
Ryan pleaded. “This might 
be some deep scientific mys- 
tery we could never discover 
in our lifetime. We might 
never get off this planet” 
That was probably behind 
his thinking all along, why he 
had been so quick to find a 
scapegoat to explain it all 
away. Explorers didn’t have 
to have all the answers, or 



even theories. But, if they 
ever wanted to get anyplace 
in the Service, they damned 
well better. 

“So what?” Ekstrohm ask- 
ed. “The Service rates us as 
expendable, doesn’t it?” 

B Y Ekstrohm’s suggestion, 
they divided the work. 
Nogol killed pigs. All day 
he did nothing but scare the 
wart-hogs to death by com- 
ing near them. 

Ryan ran as faithful a 
check on the corpses as he 
could, both by eyeball obsei*- 
vation and by radar, video and 
Pro-Tect circuits. They lack- 
ed the equipment to program 
every corpse for every sec- 
ond, but a representative job 
could be done. 

Finally, Ekstrohm went 
scouting for Something Else. 
He didn’t know what he ex- 
pected to find, but he some- 
how knew he would find some- 
thing. 

He rode the traction-scoot- 
er (so-called because it had no 
traction at all — no wheels, no 
slides, no contact with the 
ground or air) and he reflect- 
ed that he was a suspicious 
character. 

All through life, he was go- 
ing around suspecting every- 
body and now everything of 
having some dark secret they 
were trying to hide. 

A simple case of transfer- 
ence, he diagnosed, in long- 
discredited terminology. He 
had something to hide — his 



THE PLANET WITH NO NIGHTMARE

insomnia. So he th. r'\ 
everybody else had their gau- 
ty secret too. 

How could there be any 
deep secret to the pseudo- 
death on this world? It was 
no doubt a simple fear reac- 
tion, a retreat from a terri- 
fying reality. How could he 
ever prove that it was more? 
Or even exactly that? 

Internal glandular actions 
would be too subtle for a 
team of explorers to estab- 
lish. They could only go on 
behavior. What more in the 
way of behavior could he 
really hope to establish? The 
pattern was clear. The pigs 
keeled over at any unfamiliar 
sight or sound, and recovered 
when they thought the coast 
was clear. That was it. All 
there was! Why did he stub- 
bornly, stupidly insist there 
was more to it? 

Actually, by his insistence, 
he was giving weight to the 
idea of the others that he was 
strange and suspicious him- 
self. Under the normal, sane 
conditions of planetfall the 
phobias and preoccupations 
of a space crew, nurtured in 
the close confines of a scout 
ship, wouldn’t be taken seri- 
ously by competent men. But 
hadn’t his subsequent beha- 
vior given weight to Ryan’s 
unfounded accusations of ir- 
rational sabotage? Wouldn’t 
it seem that he was actually 
daring the others to prove his 
guilt? If he went on with un- 
orthodox behavior — 

18 



That was when Ekstrohm 
saw the flying whale. 

T ENSION gripped Ekstro- 
hm tighter than he grip- 
ped the handlebars of his 
scooter. He was only vaguely 
aware of the passing scenery. 
He knew he should switch on 
the homing beacon and ride in 
on automatic, but it seemed 
like too much of an effort to 
flick his finger. As the tension 
rose, the capillaries of his eyes 
swelled, and things began to 
white out for him. The rush 
of landscape became blurred 
streaks of light and dark, 
now mostly faceless light. 

The flying whale. He had 
seen it. 

Moreover, he had heard it, 
smelt and felt it. It had re- 
leased a jet of air with a 
distinctive sound and odor. It 
had blown against his skin, 
ruffled his hair. It had been 
real. 

But the flying whale 
couldn’t have been real. Con- 
ditions on this planetoid were 
impossible for it. He knew 
planets and their life possi- 
bilities. A creature with a 
skeleton like that could have 
evolved here, but the atmos- 
phere would never have sup- 
ported his flesh and hide. Wa- 
ter bodies were of insufficient 
size. No, the whale was not 
native to this world. 

Then what, if anything, did 
this flying alien behemoth 
have to do with tile pseudo- 

JIM HARMON 




death of the local pig crea- 
tures? 

I’ll never know, Ekstrohm 
told himself. Never. Ryan 
and Nogol will never believe 
me, they will never believe in 
the flying whale. They’re ex- 
plorers, simple men of action, 
unimaginative. Of course, 
I’m an explorer too. But I’m 
different, I’m sensitive — 

Ekstrohm was riding for a 
fall. 

The traction-scooter was 
going up a slope that had 
been eroded concave. It was 
at the very top of the half- 
moon angle, upside down, 
standing Ekstrohm on his 
head. Since he was not strap- 
ped into his seat, he fell. 

As he fell he thought rue- 
fully that he had contrived to 
have an accident in the only 
way possible with a traction- 
scooter. 

Ekstrohm’s cranium collid- 
ed with the ground, and he 
stopped thinking. 

E KSTROHM blinked open 
his eyes, wondering. He 
saw light, then sky, then pigs. 
Live pigs. 

But — the pigs shouldn’t be 
alive. When he was this 
close they should be dead. 
Only they weren’t. 

Why. why. 

He moved slightly and the 
nearest pig fell dead. The 
others went on with their 
business, roaming the plain. 
Ekstrohm expected the droo- 
ping of the pig to stampede 



the rest into dropping dead, 
but they didn’t seem to pay 
any attention to their fallen 
member. 

I’ve been lying here for 
hours, he realized. I didn’t 
move in on them. The pigs 
moved in on me while I was 
lying still. If I keep still I 
can get a close look at them in 
action. 

So far, even with video, it 
had been difficult to get much 
of an idea of the way these 
creatures lived — when they 
weren’t dead. 

Observe, observe, he told 
himself. 

There might be some rela- 
tionship between the flying 
whale and the pigs. 

Could it be the whales were 
intelligent alien masters of 
these herds of pigs? 

Ekstrohm lay still and ob- 
served. 

Item : the pigs ate the soft, 
mosslike grass. 

Item: the pigs eliminated 
almost constantly. 

Item : the pigs fought regu- 
larlv. 

Fought? 

Fought? 

Here was something, Ek- 
strohm realized. 

Why did animals fight? 

Rationalizations of nature- 
lovers aside, some fought be- 
cause they had plain mean 
nasty dispositions — like some 
people. That didn’t fit the 
pigs. Thev were indolent 
grazers. They hadn’t the 
energy left over for sheer-cus- 

19 



THE PLANET WITH NO NIGHTMARE 




sedness. There had to be a 
definite goal to their battles. 

It wasn’t food. That was 
abundant. The grassy veldt 
reached to all horizons. 

Sex. They had to be fight- 
ing for mates! 

He became so excited he 
twitched a foot slightly. Two 
more pigs dropped dead, but 
the others paid no heed. 

He watched the lazily mill- 
ing herd intently, at the same 
time keeping an eye out for 
the flying whales. Back on 
Earth porpoises had been 
taught to herd schools of fish 
and of whales. It was not im- 
possible an intelligent species 
of whale had learned to herd 
masses of land animals. 

But Ekstrohm knew he 
needed proof. He had to have 
something to link the pseudo- 
death of the wart-hogs to the 
inexplicable presence of the 
whales. Perhaps, he thought, 
the “death” of the pigs was 
the whales’ way of putting 
them into cold storage — a 
method of making the meat 
seem unattractive to other 
animals, on a world perhaps 
without carrion scavengers. 

Something was stirring 
among the pigs. 

O NE under-sized beastie 
was pawing the dirt, a 
red eye set on the fattest ani- 
mal in sight. Then Shortie 
charged Fatso. But abruptly 
a large raw-boned critter was 
in Shortie’s path, barring him 
from Fatso. 



Faced by Big Boy, Shortie 
trembled with rage and went 
into a terrible temper tan- 
trum, rolling on the ground, 
pawing it in frenzy, squealing 
in maddened rage. Then 
Shortie was on his feet, des- 
perate determination showing 
in every line of his body. 
With heedless, desperate, 
foolhardy courage he charged 
Big Boy. 

Big Boy took the headlong 
charge in his side with only 
a trifling grunt. 

Shortie bounced ten feet in 
the light gravity, and grimly 
wallowed to his feet. He lev- 
eled an eye at Big Boy, and 
his legs were pumping in 
frenzied fury again. 

Big Boy shifted his kilos of 
weight casually and met 
Shortie head on. 

The tremendous ker-rack 
reverberated from the bluff 
behind Ekstrohm. 

Shortie lay on the ground. 

No, Ekstrohm thought, he 
isn’t dead. His sides were 
pumping in and out. But he 
was knocked cold. 

Ekstrohm had to sympa- 
thize with him. He had never 
seen a more valiant try 
against insurmountable odds. 

Big Bov was ambling over 
towards Fatso, apparently to 
claim his prize. Fatso appar- 
ently was the sow. 

But Big Boy stalked on past 
Fatso. She squealed after him 
tentatively, but he turned and 
blasted her back with a bel- 
lowing snort.

JIM HARMON 




Ekstrohm watched the 
scene repeated with other ac- 
tors several times before he 
was sure. 

The older males, the Big 
Boys, never collected the fa- 
vors of the harem for them- 
selves. 

Instinctively, the pigs were 
practicing birth control. The 
older males abstained, and 
forced the younger males to 
do the same. 

On a world like this, Ek- 
strohm’s first thought was of 
death. 

He thought, these pigs must 
be like lemmings, deliberately 
trying to destroy their own 
race, to commit geno-suicide. 

But that didn’t answer any 
of the other questions, about 
the pseudo-death, the alien 
whales. 

And then Ekstrohm 
thought not of death but of 
life. 

IV 

T HE traction-scooter was 
where he had left it, hang- 
ing upside down on the un- 
derside of the concave slope. 
It had stopped automatically 
when his weight had left the 
seat. He reached up, toggled 
the OVERRIDE switch and 
put it manually into reverse. 

Once straightened out, he 
was on his way back to the 
base. 

I feel good, he thought. I 
feel like I could lick my 
weight in spacemen. 



Only then did he realize 
why he felt so good. 

What had happened had 
been so strange for him, he 
couldn’t realize what it had 
been until now. 

While he had been knock- 
ed out, he had been asleep. 

Asleep. 

For the first time in years. 

Sleep. He felt wonderful. 
He felt like he could lick all 
of his problems. 

Ekstrohm roared back into 
the base. The motor was si- 
lent on the traction-scooter, 
of course, but the air he kick- 
ed up made its own racket. 

Ryan and Nogol came out 
to greet him sullenly. 

“Listen,” he told them, 
“I’ve got the answer to all 
of this.” 

“So have we,” Ryan said 
ugly. “The fir§t answer was 
the right one. We’ve been 
scaring pigs to death and 
watching them, scaring and 
watching. We learned noth- 
ing. You knew we wouldn’t. 
You set us up for this. It’s 
like you said. You fed all of 
these beasts your stuff in ad- 
vance, something that acts 
when they get excited. .” 

It didn’t make sense, but 
then it never had. You 
couldn’t argue with prejudice. 
He was “different.” He didn’t 
act like they did. He didn’t 
believe the same things. He 
was the outsider, therefore 
suspect. The alien on an alien 
world. 

Ekstrohm sighed. Man 

21 



THE PLANET WITH NO NIGHTMARE 




would always be the final ali- 
en, the creature man would 
never understand, sympathize 
with or even tolerate. 

There was no point in try- 
ing to argue further, Ek- 
strohm realized. 

“You’ll never understand, 
Ryan. You could have seen 
all the things I saw if you’d 
bothered to look, but you were 
too anxious to blame me. But 
if I can’t make you under- 
stand, I can at least beat you 
into acceptance.” 

“Huh?” Ryan ventured. 

“I said,” Ekstrohm repeat- 
ed, “that I’m going to beat 
some sense into your thick 
skull.” 

Ryan grinned, rippled his 
massive shoulders and charg- 
ed. 

E KSTROHM remembered 
the lesson Shortie had 
taught him with Big Boy. He 
didn’t meet the captain’s 
charge head on. He sidestep- 
ped and caught Ryan behind 
the ear with his fist. The big 
man halted, puzzled. Ek- 
strohm sank his fist into the 
thick, solid belly. 

Slowly, Ryan’s knees gave 
way and he sank towards the 
ground. 

When his chin was at the 
right level of convenience, Ek- 
strohm put his weight behind 
his right. 

Ryan swayed dreamily 
backward. 

But he threw himself for- 
ward and one ham of a fist 

22 



connected high on Ekstrohm’s 
cheek. He was shaken to his 
toes, and the several hours’ 
old pain in the back of his 
head throbbed sickeningly. 
One more like that would do 
for him. 

Ekstrohm stood and drove 
in a lot of short punches to 
Ryan’s body, punches without 
much power behind them be- 
cause he didn’t have it. But 
he knew better than to try a 
massive attack on a massive 
target. 

When he couldn’t lift his 
arms any more, Ekstrohm 
stopped punching. He realiz- 
ed Ryan had fallen on his face 
a few seconds before. 

Then he remembered, and 
whirled. He had left his back 
exposed to Nogol. 

N o g o 1 smiled. “I’m not 
drawing Hazard Pay.” 

After a while, Ekstrohm 
stopped panting and faced 
Nogol and the captain who 
was now sitting, rubbing his 
jaw. “Okay,” he said, “now 
you’ll listen or I’ll beat your 
skulls in. I know what’s be- 
hind all of this on this 
planet.” 

“Yeah? What do you think 
it is. Stormy?” Ryan asked. 

“First of all, I think there’s 
a basic difference between 
this world and any other the 
ExPe has investigated.” 

“Now what could that be?” 
Nogol wanted to know with a 
tiny smile. 

“These worlds are close. 
The gravity is low. You 

JIM HARMON 




wouldn’t need much more 
than a jet plane to get from 
one of these planetoids to an- 
other. Some animals have de- 
veloped with the power to tra- 
vel from ohe of these plane- 
toids to another — like a squid 
jetting out water. They har- 
nessed some natural power 
system.” 

“What does that prove?” 
Ryan wanted to know. 

“It proves that this world 
and others in this belt are 
prepared for interplanetary 
travel. It’s probably a part of 
their basic evolutional struc- 
ture, unlike that of heavy, in- 
dependent planets. This false 
‘dying’ is part of their prep- 
aration for interplanetary 
visitors.” 

“Why would these aliens 
want others to think that they 
were dead?” Ryan asked. 

“Correction, captain. They 
want visitors to believe that 
they can die.” 

R YAN blinked. “Meaning 
that they can't die?” 
“That’s right. I think 
everything on this planet has 
immortality,” Ekstrohm said. 
“I’m not exactly sure how. 
Maybe it has to do with the 
low radiation. Every indi- 
vidual cell has a *memory’ of 
the whole creature. But as 
we age that ‘memory’ becomes 
faulty, our cells ‘forget’ how 
to reproduce themselves ex- 
actly. Here, that cell ‘mem- 
ory’ never fades. Bodies re- 
new themselves indefinitely.” 



“But why hide it?” Nogol 
asked. 

“This planetoid can just 
support so many creatures. 
They practice birth control 
among themselves,” the sur- 
veyor said. “The natives na- 
turally want to discourage 
colonization.” 

Ryan whistled. “Once we 
report this, every rich and 
powerful man in the Federa- 
tion will want to come here to 
live. There’s not enough space 
to go around. There will be 
wars over this little hunk of 
rock.” 

Nogol’s hard, dark eyes 
were staring into space. 
“There’s only one sensible 
thing to do. We’ll keep the 
world to ourselves.” 

“I don’t like that kind of 
talk,” Ryan growled. 

“Ryan, this little ball of 
dirt isn’t going to do the Fed- 
eration as a whole any good. 
But it can be of value to us. 
We can make ourselves com- 
fortable here. Later on, we 
can bring in some women. 
Any women we want. Who 
wouldn’t want to come here?” 

Ryan began to argue, but 
Ekstrohm could see he was 
hooked. The man who risked 
his life, the man who sought 
something new and different, 
the explorer, was basically an 
unstable type removed from 
the mainstream of civiliza- 
tion. Nothing was liable to 
change that. 

By nightfall, Rvan and 
Ekstrohm had agreed. 



THE PLANET WITH NO NIGHTMARE 



23 




“We’ll have to keep a con- 
stant watch,” Ryan was say- 
ing. “We'll have to watch out 
for ExPe scouts looking for 
us. Or, after a few genera- 
tions, another ship may come 
to complete the mapping.” 
Nogol smiled. “We'll have 
to keep an eye on each other 
too, you know. One of us may 
get to wanting more room for 
more women. Or to have chil- 
dren, a normal biological 
urge. Death by violence isn’t 
ruled out here.” 

“I don’t like that kind of 
talk,” Ryan blustered. 

Nogol smiled. 

Ekstrohm thought of the 
others, of the sleepless, 
watchful nights ahead of 
them. That was probably his 
trouble, all of his life. He 
didn’t trust people ; he had to 
stay awake and keep an eye 
on everybody. Well, he would 
be one ahead here. 

Of course, it was wrong not 
to trust anybody, but Ek- 
strohm knew habit patterns 
were hard to break. 

Sleep is a habits 



R YAN and Nogol were jar- 
red awake in the night by 
the spaceship blasting off 
without them. They ran out 
and shook their tiny fists in 
fury at the rising flame. 

Operating a spaceship 
alone was no cinch but it 
could be done. Ekstrohm 
would get back to the nearest 
Federation base and report 
the planetoid without death. 
He didn’t have absolute con- 
fidence in any government, 
no. But he suspected the Fed- 
eration could do more with 
the world than two men like 
Ryan and Nogol. 

Ekstrohm took his fingers 
off the punchboard and lay 
back on his couch. 

He yawned. 

Ryan and Nogol were slow, 
but in time they might have 
learned to do without sleep, 
and to guard their treasure 
night and day. 

Fortunately, Ekstrohm 
knew from long experience 
what the two others didn’t. 

An eternity without sleep 
isn’t worth the price. — END

Naturally human work was more creative, more inspiring,

THE REAL 
SELL 

BY WILLIAM W. STUART 

B EN TILMAN sat down in 
the easiest of all easy 
chairs. He picked up a maga- 
zine, flipped pages; stood up, 
snapped fingers; walked to 
the view wall, walked back; 
sat down, picked up the maga- 
zine. 

He was waiting, near the 
end of the day, after hours, in 
the lush, plush waiting room 
— “The customer’s ease is the 
Sales Manager’s please” — to 
see the Old Man. He was fidg- 
ety, but not about something. 
About nothing. He was irri- 
tated at nobody, at the world ; 
at himself. 

He was irritated at himself 
because there was no clear 
reason for him to be irritated 
at anything. 

There he sat, Ben Tilman, 



HARD 



normally a cheerful, pleasant 
young man. He was a sales- 
man like any modern man and 
a far better salesman than 
most. He had a sweet little 
wife, blonde and pretty. He 
had a fine, husky two-year-old 
boy, smart, a re*il future Na- 
tional Sales Manager. He 
loved them both. He had every 
reason to be contented with 
his highly desirable, comfort- 
able lot. 

And yet he had been getting 
more sour and edgy ever since 
about six months after the 
baby came home from the 
Center and the novelty of re- 
sponsibility for wife and child 
had worn off. He had now 
quit three jobs, good enough 
sales jobs where he was doing 
well, in a year. For no reason? 

25 





For petty, pointless reasons. 

With Ancestral Insurance, 
“Generations of Protection,” 
he’d made the Billion Dollar 
Club — and immediately begun 
to feel dissatisfied with it — 
just before cute, sexy, blonde 
Betty had suddenly come from 
nowhere into his life and he 
had married her. That had 
helped, sure. But as soon after 
that as he had started paying 
serious attention to his job 
again, he was fed up with it. 
“Too much paper work. All 
those forms. It’s work for a 
robot, not a man,” he’d told 
Betty when he quit. A lie. The 
paper work was, as he looked 
back on it, not bad at all; 
pleasant even, in a way. It 
was just — nothing. Anything. 

Indoor-Outdoor Climatizers 
— sniffles, he said, kept killing 
his sales presentation even 
though his -record was good 
enough. Ultra-sonic tooth- 
brushes, then, were a fine 
product. Only the vibration, 
with his gold inlay, seemed to 
give him headaches after ev- 
ery demonstration. He didn’t 
have a gold inlay. But the 
headaches were real enough. 
So he quit. 

So now he had a great new 
job with a great organization, 
Almagamated Production for 
Living — ALPRODLIV. He 
was about to take on his first 
big assignment. 

For that he had felt a spark 
of the old enthusiasm and it 
had carried him into working 
out a bright new sales ap- 

26 



proach for the deal tonight. 
The Old Man himself had 
taken a personal interest, 
which was a terrific break. 
And still Ben Tilman felt that 
uneasy dissatisfaction. Damn. 

“Mr. Robb will see you now, 
Mr. Tilman,” said the cool ro- 
bot voice from the Elec-Sec 
Desk. It was after customer 
hours and the charming hu- 
man receptionist had gone. 
The robot secretary, like most 
working robots, was function- 
al in form — circuits and 
wires, mike, speaker, exten- 
sion arms to type and to reach 
any file in the room, wheels 
for intra-office mobility. 

“Thanks, hon,” said Ben. 
Nevertheless, robot secre- 
taries were all programmed 
and rated female — and it was 
wise to be polite to them. Af- 
ter all, they could think and 
had feelings. There were a lot 
of important things they could 
do for a salesman — or, some- 
times, not do. This one, being 
helpful, stretched out a long 
metal arm to open the door to 
the inner office for Ben. He 
smiled his appreciation and 
went in. 

T HE Old Man, Amalgamat- 
ed’s grand old salesman, 
was billiard bald, aging, a lit- 
tle stout and a little slower 
now. But he was still a fine 
sales manager. He sat at his 
huge, old fashioned oak desk 
as Ben walked across the 
office. 

“Evening, sir.” No re-

sponse. Louder, "Good eve- 
ning, Mr. Robb. Mr. Robb, it’s 
Ben, sir. Ben Tilman. You 
memo’d me to come — ” Still 
no sign. The eyes, under the 
great, beetling brows, seemed 
closed. 

Ben grinned and reached 
out across the wide desk to- 
ward the small, plastic box 
hanging on the Old Man’s 
chest. The Old Man glanced 
up as Ben tapped the plastic 
lightly with his fingernail. 

"Oh, Ben. It’s you.’’ The Old 
Man raised his hand to adjust 
the ancient style hearing aid 
he affected as Ben sank into 
a chair. "Sorry Ben. I just 
had old Brannic Z-IX in here. 
A fine old robot, yes, but like 
most of that model, long-wind- 
ed. So — ’’ He gestured at the 
hearing aid. 

Ben smiled. Everyone knew 
the Old. Man used that crude 
old rig so he could pointedly 
tune out conversations he 
didn’t care to hear. Any time 
you were talking to him and 
that distant look came into his 
half closed eyes, you could be 
sure that you were cut off. 

“Sorry, Ben. Well now. I 
simply wanted to check with 
you, boy. Everything all set 
for tonight?” 

"Well, yes, sir. Everything 
is set and programmed. Betty 
and I will play it all evening 
for the suspense, let them 
wonder, build it up — and 
then, instead of the big pitch 
they’ll be looking for, we’ll let 
it go easy.” 

THE REAL HARD SELL 



"A new twist on the old 
change-up. Ben, boy, it’s going 
to go. I feel it. It’s in the air, 
things are just ripe for a new, 
super-soft-sell pitch. Selling 
you’ve got to do by feel, eh 
Ben? By sales genius and the 
old seat of the pants. Good. 
After tonight I’m going all 
out, a hemisphere-wide, thirty 
day campaign I’ll put the top 
sales artist of every regional 
office on it. They can train on 
your test pattern tapes. I be- 
lieve we can turn over billions 
before everybody picks up the 
signal and it senilesces. You 
give an old man a new faith 
in sales, Ben! You’re a sales- 
man.” 

“Well, sir — ” But the Old 
Man’s knack with the youth- 
ful-enthusiasm approach was 
contagious. For the moment 
Ben caught it and he felt 
pretty good about the coming 
night’s work. He and Betty 
together would put the deal 
over. That would be some- 
thing. 

Sure it would . 

“How do you and your wife 
like the place, Ben?” It was 
some place, for sure, the brand 
new house that Amalgamated 
had installed Ben, Betty and 
Bennie in the day after he had 
signed up. 

“It’s — uh — just fine, sir. 
Betty likes it very much, 
really. We both do.” He hoped 
his tone was right. 

"Good, Ben. Well, be sure 
to stop by in the morning. 
I’ll have the tapes, of course. 



27 




but I’ll want your analysis. 
Might be a little vacation 
bonus in it for you, too.” 

"Sir, I don’t know how to 
thank you.” 

The Old Man waved a hand. 
“Nothing you won’t have 
earned, my boy. Robots can’t 
sell.” That was the set dismis- 
sal. 

“Yes, sir. Robots can’t man- 
age sales, or — ” He winked. 
The Old Man chuckled. An old 
joke was never too old for the 
Old Man. The same old bro- 
mides every time; and the 
same hearty chuckle. Ben left 
on the end of it. 

D IALING home on his new, 
Company-owned, conver- 
tible soar-kart, he felt not too 
bad. Some of the old lift in 
spirits came as the kart-pilot 
circuits digested the direc- 
tions, selected a route and 
zipped up into a north-north- 
west traffic pattern. The Old 
Map was a wonderful sales 
manager and boss. The new 
house-warming pitch that he 
and Betty would try tonight 
was smart. He could feel he 
had done something. 

Exercising his sales ability 
with fair success, he fed him- 
self this pitch all along the 
two hundred mile, twenty- 
minute hop home from the 
city. The time and distance 
didn’t bother him. “Gives me 
time to think,” he had told 
Betty. Whether or not this 
seemed to her an advantage, 
she didn’t say. At least she 



liked the place, “Almalga- 
mated’s Country Gentleman 
Estate — Spacious, Yet fully 
Automated.” 

“We are,” the Old Man told 
Ben when he was given the 
Company - assigned quarters, 
“starting a new trend. With 
the terrific decline in birth 
rate during the past 90 to 100 
years, you’ll be astonished at 
how much room there is out 
there. No reason for everyone 
to live in the suburban cen- 
ters any more. With millions 
of empty apartments in them, 
high time we built something 
else, eh? Trouble with people 
today, no initiative in obso- 
lescing. But we’ll move them.” 

Home, Ben left the kart out 
and conveyed up- the walk. The 
front door opened. Betty had 
been watching for him. He 
walked to the family vueroom, 
as usual declining to convey 
in the house. The hell with 
the conveyor’s feelings, if so 
simple a robot really had any. 
He liked, to walk. 

“Color pattern,” Betty or- 
dered the vuescreen as he 
came in, “robot audio out.” 
With people talking in the 
house it was still necessary to 
put the machines under mas- 
ter automatic and manual 
control. Some of the less 
sophisticated robots might 
pick up some chance phrase of 
conversation and interpret it 
as an order if left on audio. 

“Ben,” said Betty, getting 
up to meet him, "you’re late.” 

Ben was too good a sales- 

WILLIAM W, STUART 



28 




man to argue that. Instead, 
he took her in his arms and 
kissed her. It was a very good 
sixty seconds later that she 
pushed him away with a 
severeness destroyed by a 
blush and a giggle to say, 
“Late but making up for lost 
time, huh? And sober, too. 
You must be feeling good for 
a change.” 

“Sure — and you feel even 
better, sugar.” He reached for 
her again. She slipped away 
from him, laughing, but his 
wrist tel-timer caught on the 
locket she always wore, her 
only momento from her par- 
ents, dead in the old moon-orb 
crash disaster. She stood still, 
slightly annoyed, as he un- 
hooked and his mood was, not 
broken, but set back a little. 
“What’s got into you tonight 
anyway, Ben?” 

“Oh, I don’t know. Did I 
tell you, the O.M. may give 
us a vacation? Remember 
some of those nights up at 
that new ‘Do It Yourself’ 
Camp last summer?” 

“Ben !” She blushed, smiled. 
“We won’t get any vacation 
if we blow our house-warming 
pitch tonight, you know. And 
we have three couples due 
here in less than a half hour. 
Besides, I have to talk to you 
about Nana.” 

ti^pHAT damned new CD- 
1 IX model. Now what?” 
“She’s very upset about 
Bennie. I’m not sure I blame 
her. This afternoon he simply 

THE REAL HARD SELL 



refused his indoctrination. All 
the time he should have been 
playing store with Playmate 
he insisted on drawing things 
— himself, mind you, not 
Playmate. On the walls, with 
an old pencil of yours he 
found someplace in your 
things. Nana couldn’t do a 
thing with him. She says 
you’ve got to give him a spank- 
ing.” 

“Why me? Why not you?” 
“Now Ben, we’ve been over 
that and over it. Discipline is 
the father’s job.” 

“Well, I won’t do it. Ben- 
nie’s just a baby. Let him do 
a few things himself. Won’t 
hurt him.” 

“Ben!" 

“That Nana is an officious 
busybody, trying to run our 
lives.” 

“Oh, Ben! You know Nana 
loves little Bennie. She only 
wants to help hirm” 

“But to what?” 

“She’d never dream of lift- 
ing a finger against Bennie no 
matter what he did. And she 
lives in terror that he’ll cut 
her switch in some temper tan- 
trum.” 

“Hmph ! Well, I’m going up 
right now and tell her if I 
hear another word from her 
about spanking Bennie, I’ll 
cut her switch myself. Then 
she can go back to Central for 
reprogramming and see how 
she likes it.” 

“Ben! You wouldn’t.” 
“Why not? Maybe she needs 
a new personality?” 



29 




“You won't say a thing to 
her. You’re top soft-hearted.” 
“This time I won't be.” 
This time he wasn't. He met 
Nana CD-IX in the hallway 
outside Bennie's room. Like 
all nurse, teaching, and chil- 
dren’s personal service robots, 
she was human in form, ex- 
cept for her control dial safely 
out of baby’s reach, top, cen- 
ter. 

The human form was re- 
assuring to children, kept 
them from feeling strange 
with parent’s back. Nana was 
big, gray-haired, stout, buxom, 
motherly, to reassure parents. 

“Now, Mr. Tilman,” she 
said with weary impatience, 
“you are too late. Surely you 
don’t intend to burst in and 
disturb your son now.” 
“Surely I do.” 

“But he is having his sup- 
per. You will upset him. Can’t 
you understand that you 
should arrange to be here be- 
tween 5:30 and 6 if you wish 
to interview the child?” 

“Did he miss me? Sorry, I 
couldn’t make it earlier. But 
now I am going to see him a 
minute.” 

“Mr. Tilman!” 

“Nana! And what’s this 
about your wanting Bennie 
spanked because he drew a 
few pictures?” 

“Surely you realize these 
are the child’s formative 
years, Mr. Tilman. He shouM 
be learning to think in terms 
of selling now — not doing 
things. That’s robot work, Mr. 

30 



Tilman. Robots can’t sell, you 
know, and what will people, 
let alone robots think if you 
let your boy grow up — ” 

WTTE’s growing up fine; and 
11 1 am going in to see 
him.” 

“Mr. Tilman!” 

“And for two credits, Nana, 

I’d cut your switch. You hear 
me?” 

“Mr. Tilman — no! No, 
please. I’m sorry. Let the boy 
scrawl a bit ; perhaps it won’t 
hurt him. Go in and see him 
if you must, but do try not to 
upset him or — All right, all 
right. But please Mr. Tilman, 
my switch—” 

“Very well Nana. I’ll leave 
it. This time.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Tilman.” 
“So we understand each 
other, Nana. Though, matter 
of fact, I’m hanged if I ever . 
did quite see why you senior- * 
level robots get so worked up 
about your identities.” 
“Wouldn’t you, Mr. Til- 
man?” 

“Of course. But — well, yes, 

I suppose I do see, in a way. 
Let’s go see Bennie-boy.” 

So Ben Tilman went into 
the nursery and enjoyed every 
second of a fast fifteen-minute 
roughhouse with his round- 
faced. laughing, chubby son 
and heir. No doubt it was 
very bad, just after supper. 
But Nana, with a rather hu- 
manly anxious restraint, con- 
fined herself to an unobtru- 
sive look of disapproval. 

WILLIAM W. STUART 




He left Bennie giggling and 
doubtless upset, at least to a 
point of uneagerness for 
Nana’s bedtime story about 
Billie the oldtime newsboy, 
who sold the Brooklyn Bridge. 

So then he was run through 
a fast ten-minute shower, 
shave and change by Valet. 
He floated downstairs just as 
Betty came out of the cocktail 
lounge to say, “Code 462112 
on the approach indicator. 
Must be the Stoddards. They 
always get every place first, 
in time for an extra drink.” 
“Fred and Alice, yes. But 
damn their taste for gin, don’t 
let Barboy keep the cork in 
the vermouth all evening. I 
like a touch of vermouth. I 
wonder if maybe I should- 
n’t—” 

“No, you shouldn’t mix the 
cocktails yourself and scan- 
dalize everybody. You know 
perfectly well Barboy really 
does do better anyway.” 

“Well, maybe. Everything 
all set, hon ? Sorry I was late.” 
"No trouble here. I just fed 
Robutler the base program 
this morning and spent the 
rest of the day planning my 
side of our Sell. How to tan- 
talize the girls, pique the cu- 
riosity without giving it away. 
But you know — ” she laughed 
a little ruefully — “I sort of 
miss not having even the 
shopping to do. Sometimes it 
hardly seems as though you 
need a wife at all.” 

Ben slid an arm around her 
waist. “Selling isn’t the only 



thing robots can’t do, sugar.” 
He pulled her close. 

“Ben ! They’re at the door.” 

They were, and then in the 
door, oh-ing and ah-ing over 
this and that. And compli- 
menting Barboy on the mar- 
tinis. Then the Wilsons came 
and the Bartletts and that 
was it. 

“Three couples will be 
right,” Ben had analyzed it. 
"Enough so we can let them 
get together and build up each 
others’ curiosity but not too 
many for easy control. People 
that don’t know us so well 
they might be likely to guess 
the gimmick. We’ll let them 
stew all evening while they 
enjoy the Country Gentleman 
House-Warming hospitality. 
Then, very casually, we toss 
it out and let it lie there in 
front of them. They will be 
sniffing, ready to nibble. The 
clincher will drive them right 
in. I’d stake my sales reputa- 
tion on it.” If it matters a 
damn, he added. But silently. 

They entertained three cou- 
ples at their house-warming 
party. It was a delightful par- 
ty, a credit to Ben, Betty and 
the finest built-in house ro- 
bots the mind of Amalgamat- 
ed could devise. 

By ten o’clock they had 
dropped a dozen or more ran- 
dom hints, but never a sales 
pitch. Suspense was building 
nicely when Betty put down 
an empty glass and unobtru- 
sively pushed the button to 
cue Nana. Perfect timing. 



THE REAL HARD SELL 



31 




They apologized to the guests, 
“We’re ashamed to be so old- 
fashioned but we feel better 
if we look in on the boy when 
he wakes in the night. It keeps 
him from forgetting us.” 
Then they floated off up- 
stairs together, ostensibly to 
see Nana and little Bennie. 

Fred Stoddard : “Some place 
they have here, eh? Off-beat. 
A little too advanced for my 
taste, this single dwelling 
idea, but maybe — Ben sure 
must have landed something 
juicy with Amalgamated to 
afford this. What the devil is 
he pushing, anyway?” 

Scoville Wilson (shrug) : 
“Beats me. You know, before 
dinner I cornered him at the 
bar to see if I could slip in a 
word or two of sell. Damned 
if he didn’t sign an order for 
my Cyclo-sell Junior Tape Li- 
brary without even a C level 
resistance. Then he talked a 
bit about the drinks and I 
thought sure he was pushing 
that new model Barboy. I was 
all set to come back with a 
sincere ‘think it over’ — -and 
then he took a bottle from the 
Barboy, added a dash of ver- 
mouth to his drink and walked 
off without a word of sell. He 
always was an odd one.” 
Lucy Wilson (turns from 
woman talk with the other 
two wives) : “Oh no! I knew 
it wasn’t the Barboy set. They 
wouldn’t have him set so slow. 
Besides didn’t you hear the 
way she carried on about the 
nursery and that lovely Nana? 

32 



That must have been a build- 
up, but Ben goofed his cue to 
move in on Sco and me for a 
close. Doesn’t Amalgamated 
handle those nurseries?” 

Tom Bartlett : “Amalgamat- 
ed makes almost anything. 
That’s the puzzle. I dunno — 
but it must be something big. 
He has to hit us with some- 
thing, doesn’t he?” 

Belle Bartlett: “Who ever 
heard of a party without a 
sell?” 

Nancy Stoddard : “Who ever 
heard of a party going past 
ten without at least a warm- 
up pitch? And Betty prom- 
ised Fred to send both Ben 
and Bennie to the Clinic for 
their Medchecks. You know 
we have the newest, finest 
diagnosticians — ” 

Fred Stoddard: “Nancy!” 
Nancy Stoddard: “Oh, I’m 
sorry. I shouldn’t be selling 
you folks at their party, 
should I? Come to think, 
you’re all signed with Fred 
anyway, aren’t you? Well, 
about Ben, / think—” 

Lucy Wilson : “Sh-h-h ! 

Here they come.” 

S MILING, charming — and 
still not an order form in 
sight — Ben and Betty got 
back to their guests. Another 
half hour. Barboy was pass- 
ing around with nightcaps. 
Lucy Wilson nervously put a 
reducegar to her sophisticated, 
penpermint-striped lips. 

Quickly Ben Tilman was on 
his feet. He pulled a small, 

WILIIAM W. STUART 




metal cylinder from his pock- 
et with a flourish and held it 
out on his open palm toward 
Lucy. A tiny robot Statue of 
Liberty climbed from the cyl- 
inder, walked across Ben’s 
hand, smiled, curtsied and 
reached out to light the re- 
ducegar with her torch, pip- 
ing in a high, thin voice, 
“Amalgamated reducegars are 
cooler, lighter, finer.” 

“Ben ! How simply darling !” 
“Do you like it? It’s a new 
thing from Amalgamated Nov- 
elDiv. You can program it for 
up to a hundred selective sell 
phrases, audio or visio key. 
Every salesman should have 
one. Makes a marvelous gift, 
and surprisingly reasonable.” 
“So that's it, Ben. I just 
love it!” 

“Good! It’s yours, compli- 
ments of Amalgamated.” 

“But — then you’re not sell- 
ing them? Well, what on 
earth—?” 

“Damn it, Ben,” Fred Stod- 
dard broke in, “come on, 
man, out with it. What in hell 
are you selling? You’ve given 
us the shakes. What is it? The 
Barboy set? It’s great. If I 
can scrape up the down pay- 
ment, 1*11 — ” 

“After we furnish a nur- 
sery with a decent Nana, Fred 
Stoddard,” Nancy snapped, 
"and get a second soar-kart. 
Ben isn’t selling Barboys any- 
way, are you, Ben? It is that 
sweet, sweet Nana, isn’t it? 
And I do want one, the whole 
nursery, Playmate and all, 

THE REAL HARD SELL 



girl-programmed of course, 
for our Polly.” 

“Is it the nursery, Betty?” 
Lucy pitched in her credit’s 
worth. “Make him tell us, 
darling. We have enjoyed 
everything so much, the din- 
ner. the Tri-deo, this whole 
lovely, lovely place of yours. 
Certainly the house wanning 
has been perfectly charming.” 
“And that’s it,” said Ben 
smiling, a sheaf of paper 
forms suddenly in his hand. 
“What? Not — ?” 

"The house, yes. Amalga- 
mated’s Country Gentleman 
Estate, complete, everything 
in it except Bennie, Betty and 
me. Your equity in your Cen- 
ter co-op can serve as down 
payment, easy three-genera- 
tion terms, issue insurance. 
Actually, I can show you how, 
counting in your entertain- 
ment, vacation, incidental, and 
living expenses, the Country 
Gentleman will honestly cost 
you less.” 

“Ben!” 

“How simply too clever!” 
Ben let it rest there. It was 
enough. Fred Stoddard, after 
a short scuffle with Scoville 
Wilson for the pen, signed the 
contract with a flourish. Sco 
followed. 

“There!” y 

“There now, Ben,” said Bet- 
ty,, holding Bennie a little 
awkwardly in her arms in the 
soar-kart. They had moved 
out so the Stoddards could 
move right in. Now they were 
on their way in to their re- 

33 




served suite at Amalgamated’s 
Guest-ville. “You were abso- 
lutely marvellous. Imagine 
selling all three of them!” 

“There wasn’t anything to 
it, actually.” 

“Ben, how can you say 
that? Nobody else could have 
done it. It was a sales master- 
piece. And just think. Now 
salesmen all over the hemis- 
phere are going to follow your 
sales plan. Doesn’t it make 
you proud? Happy? Ben, you 
aren’t going to be like that 
again?” 

No, of course he wasn’t. He 
was pleased and proud. Any- 
way, the Old Man would be, 
and that, certainly, was some- 
thing. A man had to feel good 
about winning the approval of 
Amalgamated’s grand Old 
Man. And it did seem to make 
Betty happy. 

But the Actual selling of the 
fool house and even the two 
other, identical houses on the 
other side of the hill — he iust 
couldn’t seem to get much of 
a glow over it. He had done 
it; and what had he done? It 
was the insurance and the 
toothbrushes all over again, 
and the old nervous, sour feel- 
ing inside. 

“At least we do have a va- 
cation trip coming out of it, 
hon. The O.M. practicallv 
promised it yesterdav. if our 
sell sold. We could — ” 

“ — go back to that queer 
new ‘Do It Yourself’ camp un 
on the lake you insisted on 
dragging me to the last week 

34 



of our vacation last summer. 
Ben, really !” He was going to 
be like that. She knew it. 

“Well, even you admitted it 
was some fun.” 

“Oh, sort of, I suppose. For 
a little while. Once you got 
used to the whole place with- 
out one single machine that 
could think or do even the 
simplest little thing by itself. 
So, well, almost like being 
savages. Do you think it 
would be safe for Bennie? We 
can’t watch him all the time, 
you know.” 

“People used to manage in 
the old days. And remember 
those people, the Burleys, who 
were staying up there?” 
“That queer, crazy bunch 
who went there for a vacation 
when the Camp was first 
ooened and then just stayed? 
Honestly, Ben! Surely you’re 
not thinking of — ” 

“Oh, nothing like that. Just 
a vacation. Only — ” 

Only those queer, peculiar 
people, the Burleys had seem- 
ed so relaxed and cheerful. 
Grandma and Ma Burley 
cleaning, washing, cooking on 
the ancient electric stove; 
little Donnie, being a nuisance, 
poking at the keys on his 
father's crude, manual type- 
writer, a museum piece; Don- 
nie and his brothers wasting 
away childhood digging and 
piling sand on the beach, pad- 
dling a boat and actually 
building a play house. It was 
mad. People playing robots. 
And yet, they seemed to have 

WILLIAM W. STUART 




a wonderful time while they 
were doing it. 

“But how do you keep stay- 
ing here?” he had asked Buck 
Burley, “Why don’t they put 
you out?” 

“Who?” asked Buck. “How? 
Nobody can sell me on .iv- 
ing. We like it here. No robot 
can force us out. Here we are. 
Here we stay.” 

T HEY pulled into the Guest- 
ville ramp. Bennie was 
fussy; the nursery Nana was 
strange to him. On impulse, 
Betty took him in to sleep in 
their room, ignoring the dis- 
approving stares of both the 
Nana and the Roboy with 
their things. 

They were tired, let down. 
They went to bed quietly. 

In the morning Betty was 
already up when Ben stum- 
bled out of bed. “Hi,” she said, 
nervously cheerful. “The 
house Nanas all had overload 
this morning and I won’t 
stand for any of those utility 
components with Bennie. So 
I’m taking care of him my- 
self." 

Bennie chortled and drool- 
ed vita-meal at his high-chair, 
unreprimanded. Ben mustered 
a faint smile and turned to 00 
dial a shave, cool shower and 
dress at Robather. 

That done, he had a bite of 
breakfast. He felt less than 
top-sale, but better. Last night 
had gone well. The Old Man 
would give them a pre-paid 
vacation clearance to any re- 

THE REAL HARD SELL 



sort in the world or out. Why 
gloom? 

He rubbed Bennie’s unruly 
hair, kissed Betty and convey- 
ed over from Guest-ville to 
office. 

Message-sec, in tone re- 
spect-admiration A, told him 
the Old Man was waiting for 
him. Susan, the human recep- 
tionist in the outer office, fa- 
vored him with a dazzling 
smile. There was a girl who 
could sell ; and had a product 
of her own, too. 

The Old Man was at his 
big, oak desk but, a signal 
honor, he got up and came 
half across the room to grab 
Ben’s hand and shake it. “Got 
the full report, son. Checked 
the tapes already. That’s sell- 
ing, boy! I'm proud of you. 
Tell you what, Ben. Instead 
of waiting for a sales slack, 
I'm going to move you and 
that sweet little wife of yours 
right into a spankirg new, 
special Country Gentleman 
unit I had iivmind for myself. 
And a nice, fat boost in your 
credit rating has already gone 
down to accounting. Good? 
artistic sales challenge that is 
Good. Now, Ben, I have a real, 
crying for your talent.” 

“§ir? Thank you. But, sir, 
there, is the matter of the va- 
cation- — ” 

“Vacation? Sure, Ben. Take 
a vacation anytime. But right 
now it seems to the Old Man 
you’re on a hot selling streak. 
I don’t want to see you get 
off the track, son; your into

ests are mine. And wait till 
you get your teeth into this 
one. Books, Ben boy. Books! 
People are spending all their 
time sitting in on Tri-deo, 
not reading. People should 
read more, Ben. Gives them 
that healthy tired feeling. 
Now we have the product. We 
have senior Robo-writers with 
more circuits than ever be- 
fore. All possible information, 
every conceivable plot. Maybe 
a saturation guilt type cam- 
paign to start — but it’s up to 
you, Ben. I don't care how you 
do it, but move books.” 
“Books, eh? Well, now.” 
Ben was interested. “Funny 
thing, sir, but that ties in 
with something I was think- 
ing about just last night.” 
“You have an angle? Good 
boy!” 

“Yes, sir. Well, it is a wild 
'bought maybe, but last sum- 
mer when I was on vacation I 
met a man up at that new 
camp and — well, I know it 
sounds silly, but he was writ- 
ing a book.” 

“Nonsense!” 

“Just what I thought, sir. 
But I rpad some of it and, I 
don't know, it had a sort of a 
feel about it. Something new, 
sir, it might catch on.” 

“All right, all right. That’s 
enough. You’re a salesman. 
You’ve sold me.” 

“On the book?” Ben was 
surprised. 

“Quit pulling an old man’s 
leg, Ben. I’m sold on your 
needing a vacation. I’ll fill out 

THE REAL HARD SELL 



your vacation pass right 
now.” The Old Man, still a 
vigorous, vital figure, turned 
and walked back to his Desk- 
sec. “Yes sir,” said the secre- 
tarial voice, “got it. Vacation 
clearai.ce for Tilman, Ben, 
any resort.” 

“And family,” said Ben. 

“And family. Very good, 
sir.” 

The Old Man made his sign 
on the pass and said heavily, 
“All right then, Ben. That’s it. 
Maybe if you go back up to 
that place for a few days and 
see that psycho who was writ- 
ing a book again, perhaps 
you’ll realize how impractical 
it is.” 

“But sir! I'm serious about 
that book. It really did have 
— ” he broke off. 

The Old Man was sitting 
there, face blank, withdrawn. 
Ben could feel he wasn’t even 
listening. That damned hear- 
ing aid of his. The Old Man 
had cut it off. Suddenly, un- 
reasoningly, Ben was furious. 
He stood by the huge desk and 
he reached across toward the 
hearing aid on the Old Man’s 
chest to turn up the volume. 
The Old Man looked up and 
saw Ben’s hand stretching out. 

A sudden look of Tear came 
into his china blue, clear eyes 
but he made no move. He sat 
frozen in his chair. 

Ben hesitated a second. 
“What—?" But he didn’t have 
to ask. He knew. 

And he also knew what he 
was going to do. 



37 




“No!” said the Old Man. 
“No, Ben. I’ve only been try- 
ing to help ; trying to serve 
your best interests the best 
way I know. Ben, you must- 
n’t—” 

But Ben moved forward. 

H E took the plastic box on 
the Old Man’s chest and 
firmly cut the switch. 

The Old Man, the Robot Old 
Man, went lifeless and slump- 
ed back in his chair as Ben 
stretched to cut off the Desk- 
sec. Then he picked up his va- 
cation clearance. 

“Robots can’t sell, eh?” he 
said to the dead machine be- 
hind the desk. “Well, you 
couldn’t sell me that time, 
could you, Old Man? 

Clumsily, rustily, Ben whis- 
tled a cheerful little off-key 
tune to himself. Hell, they 
could do anything at all — ex- 
cept sell. 

“You can’t fool some of the 
people all of the time,” he re- 
marked over his shoulder to 
the still, silent figure of the 
Old Man as he left the office, 
“it was a man said that.” He 
closed the door softly behind 
him. 

Betty would be waiting. 
Betty was waiting. Her 
head ached as she bounced 
Bennie, the child of Ben, of 
herself and of an unknown 
egg cell from an anonymous 
ovary, on her knees. Betty 
3-RC-VIII, secret, wife-style 
model, the highest develop- 
ment of the art of Robotics 



had known instantly when 
Ben cut the Old Man’s switch. 
She had half expected it. But 
it made her headache worse. 

“But damn my program- 
ming!” She spoke abruptly, 
aloud, nervously fingering the 
locket around her neck. 
“Damn it and shift circuit. 
He’s right ! He is my husband 
and he is right and I’m glad. 
I’m glad we’re going to the 
camp and I’m going to help 
him stay.” 

After all, why shouldn’t a 
man want to do things just as 
much as a robot? He had 
energy, circuits, feelings too. 
She knew he did. 

For herself, she loved her 
Ben and Bennie. But still just 
that wasn’t enough occupa- 
tion. She was glad they were 
going to the new isolation 
compound for non-psyehotic 
but unstable, hyper-active, 
socially dangerous individual 
humans. At the camp there 
would be things to do. 

At the camp they would be 
happy. 

All at once the headache 
that had been bothering her 
so these past months was 
gone. She felt fine and she 
smiled at little Bennie. “Ben- 
nie-boy,” she said, kissing his 
smooth, untroubled baby fore- 
head. “Daddy’s coming.” Ben- 
nie laughed and started to 
reach for the locket around 
Mommy’s neck. But just then 
the door opened and he jump- 
ed down to run and meet his 
daddy. END

I 

W HEN the twisted and 
radioactive wreckage 
screamed down out of space 
on to their dark planet, the 
Shogleet were instantly in- 
trigued. To that incredibly an- 
cient race, evolved to the point 
whei'e energy, matter and 
form had no more secrets to 
hide and only curiosity re- 
mained, anything new was an 
occasion for rejoicing. And 
this was new. 

Metals, plastics, physical 
and chemical combinations — 
they were familiar enough. 
But this strange mass had 
been formed into a particular 
shape. They probed at once, 
and at once found that there 
was something more. 

Something lived, but only 
just. 

Using their combined tal- 
ents, they caught at the fragile 
remnant, preserved it, studied 
it, reconstructed it. From the 
still viable patterns of intelli- 
gence, they deduced the whole. 
They remade a man. They 
went further, discovering his 
history and, from that, some- 
thing of the history of the 
whole species. They were un- 
willing to admit that such a 
monstrosity could be genuine, 
yet their probings could not 
be argued. So they remade 
his ship, which had obviously 
been only a small part of the 
whole tangled wreckage, and 
they sent it back whence it had 
came. And they appointed 



one of their number to go With 
it, and him, to investigate. 

T HE Shogleet crouched by 
Lancelot’s beautiful boots, 
and purred. The purr was not 
a sign of pleasure, but the by- 
product of producing an out- 
line-blurring vibration and a 
curiosity-damping field. The 
corridor outside the Agent- 
Director’s office was a busy 
place, and the Shogleet had 
no wish to be observed. 

Yet it was pleased. These 
things called Men were even 
more fantastically odd than it 
had at first imagined. With its 
perceptors extended, it was 
listening to the conversation 
on the other side of the wall. 
Voices were discussing Lance- 
lot. 

“ — not only made us a 
laughing-stock, but he’s get- 
ting to be a damned pest! 
Hanging about outside my of- 
fice, demanding to be sent on 
a mission. I wouldn’t trust 
him to empty my waste-bas- 
ket. What the hell am I going 
to do with him?” 

“Perhaps we might cook up 
a mission for him, Chief.” 
“Don’t be obscene, Peters. 
That moron, on a mission? 
Don’t forget, this is the blast- 
ed idiot who tried to rescue a 
disabled star-ship with a one- 
man raft!” 

“Just the same, Chief, we 
could pick out something.” 
“But I can’t send a Prime 
G-man on a routine call, damn 
it. Not that he is a Prime, 



40 



JOHN RACKHAM 




except on paper. But you know 
what I mean.” 

“Ah, but wait until you hear 
what I’ve dug up. It’s from 
a Vivarium planet. We don’t 
usually handle those. What 
generally happens is that the 
local man goes in, disguised, 
and re-sets the alarm, then 
smoothes out the fuss. Doesn’t 
affect us unless it’s a case of 
external invasion, you know.” 
“All right, all right. I know 
all that. But what’s it to me? 
Some inside problem on a Viv 
planet. So?” 

“Yes. But this planet is 
called Avalon. It’s static in the 
‘pseudo-feudal’ stage, with a 
culture based on Arthurian 
legend. Get it?” 

The Shogleet, recording all 
this avidly, head a gasp. Put- 
ting mental query marks 
against the new terms, it went 
on listening. 

“Arthurian!” Hugard 
breathed. “Peasants. Knights 
in armor. Sword and shield 
stuff. Go on.” 

"I thought we could play 
it up big, and let him have it. 
Make it sound a desperate 
emergency. Give him some- 
thing to do.” 

“Yes. Quite harmless, of 
course. But I like the sound of 
it. Where is this Avalon?” 
“That’s the best part, Chief. 
It’s in the Omega Centaurus 
cluster. That’s twenty thou- 
sand lights away!” 

“That settles it for me. It 
will take him a . month, real 
time, just to get there. I’ll be 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



shut of him for a while. Sure 
we’re not treading on any pri- 
vate toes with this?” 
“Absolutely. Strictly a rou- 
tine call, on a waiting list.” 
“Fine. Fine! Get me the 
data so I can blow it up big, 
and then shoot him in here. 
Peters, I won’t forget this. To 
think that I’m going to be rid 
of that moron, for a while at 
least — ” 

T HE Shogleet crept to Lan- 
celot’s shoulder, shivering 
gently with anticipation. 
When the summons came, it 
rode into the office with him 
and saw him stiffen into a 
stern salute before the Direc- 
tor’s desk. 

“Ah, Lake,” Hugard nodded 
portentously. “At last I have 
a mission for you. Something 
I cannot pass on to anyone 
else. It will tax your powers 
to the utmost. I am not asking 
you to volunteer ; I am order- 
ing you to go. That is how 
serious it is. You understand?” 
“I do, sir,” Lancelot said, 
sternly. “Rely on me!” 

“Good man! I was count- 
ing on that. Now, you’ll take 
full details with you to study 
en route, of course, but I can 
give you the gist. The planet 
is Avalon. The alarm is ur- 
gent. Avalon is a closed cul- 
ture. No one, not even we of 
Galactopol, can intervene in 
a closed culture, unless the 
situation is desperately criti- 
cal.” The Shogleet felt Lance- 
lot stiffen, saw the swell of 

41 




his chest and the fire in his 
eyes, and wondered anew at 
these strange creatures who 
thrilled to the prospect of 
imminent danger. 

“Most importantly — ” Hug- 
gard hushed his voice — 
“As this is a closed culture, 
I can only send one man. You 
will be alone. Single-handed. 
You will be equipped, of 
course, as fully as possible, 
compatible with the culture. 
But everything else will be up 
to you. You’re on your own.” 

“I understand, sir,” Lance- 
lot said simply. “Rely on me. 
If it's called for, I’ll stake my 
life, rather than let down the 
Service.” Huggard turned his 
face away, obviously overcome 
by some strong emotion. Then, 
coughing, he handed a form 
to Lancelot and stood up. 

“That’s your authorization. 
You’ll pick up the rest of the 
documents at the front office. 
How soon can you leave?” 

“At once!” Lancelot snap- 
ped, saluting crisply. Hugard 
put out a hand. 

“Good luck, my boy. You’ll 
need it.” 

“Thank you, sir.” Lancelot 
took the hand with an enthu- 
siasm that made the Director 
wince. “Don’t worry about 
me. I’ll come through!” He 
spun on his heel and marched 
from the office. 

“You know,” he confided to 
the Shogleet, “Hugard isn’t 
such a bad old guy, after all. 
I thought he was neglecting 
me. But I can see his point, 

42 



now. I’ve misjudged him.” ... 

“Lancelot,” the Shogleet 
whispered, “do something for 
me. Get a stock of visio-tapes 
on feudal cultures, vivarium 
planets and the Arthurian 
legend.” 

“All right. Anything to 
oblige. But you pick the queer- 
est things to be curious about. 
Arthurian legends, is it? My 
Dad used to be interested in 
them.” 

T HIS the Shogleet already 
knew, as well as much 
more. It had learned, for one 
thing, the truer version of 
how Lancelot Lake came to be 
cast away in the first place. 
This it had picked up from 
various sources, in and about 
Galactopol headquarters. 

Lancelot Lake had been a 
humble technician in the low- 
est grades of Galactopol, serv- 
ing his time in a spaceways 
emergency - and - observation 
station, and passing his time 
in dreams of glamor and 
glory. He shared the simple 
faith of his equally simple 
parents, that it was just a 
matter of time before he had 
his big “break.” And Fate had 
been very obliging. 

The star-class liner Orion, 
carrying wealthy passengers 
but very little else, had devel- 
oped a major defect in her 
main drive. Her skipper, in 
angry calm, warped out of 
hyper-drive, gave the order 
“Abandon Ship!” and pointed 
his lifeboat cluster toward the 

JOHN RACKHAM 




nearest E-and-O station. It 
had not been an emergency. 
There had not been the least 
danger — only nuisance, and 
the loss of a valuable ship. 
The lifeboat signals had plain- 
ly said so. 

But Lancelot had read his 
own special brand of under- 
standing into those signals. 
On the run, fired with holy 
zeal, he had broken out his 
one-man raft, designed purely 
for short-range forays about 
the surface of his planetoid- 
station. Linking in to the pow- 
erful, all - wave, sub - etheric 
emergency radio of the sta- 
tion and giving a blow-by- 
blow account of his effort, he 
had stormed off to rescue the 
Orion single-handed. 

No one could hear the life- 
boat signals, after that. The 
Orion company reached the 
E-and-0 station quite safely. 
There, in company with every 
other open planet in the Gal- 
axy, they had listened, fas- 
cinated, to the classic broad- 
cast that Lancelot was pour- 
ing out. 

Dedicated, always brave, 
heedless of personal safety, 
washed with the radiation 
from a rapidly disintegrating 
nuclear drive, he kept on to 
the inevitable, hopeless, gal- 
lant end. Like a gnat grao- 
pling a runaway elephant, he 
went spiralling down into the 
great gravity sink of Antares, 
until the thermal radiation 
from that giant sun over- 
whelmed his transmission. 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



The rest was silence. 

Now, a stupid, gloriously 
gallant, dead hero, is one 
thing. Posthumous awards are 
a matter of little consequence. 
It was nothing — the least 
they could do — to make the 
deceased Lancelot a Prime G- 
man. But the same hero re- 
turned from the dead was 
something else again, as the 
Shogleet had learned. 

Perhaps, it pondered, they 
had done too good a job of the 
reconstruction. They had made 
him strictly according to the 
images in his own brain. Con- 
sequently, he was big, brawny, 
blue -eyed, golden-haired, 
handsome, and well-nigh in- 
destructible . translating 
literally the concept “You 
can’t keep a good man down.” 
Had Lancelot known Hamlet, 
he would have agreed with 
his description : “What a piece 
of work is Man ; how noble in 
reason; how infinite in facul- 
ties ; in form and .moving, how 
express and admirable; in ac- 
tion how like an angel; in 
apprehension how like a god !” 
But Hamlet was insane, 
whereas Lancelot was sincere, 
simole, and assured of the 
reality of his dream. Hence — 
as Hugard had said — a 
damned pest. 

II 

L ANCELOT’S happy glow 
lasted well into the second 
week. Then he grew bored. 
The ship, though small, was 

43 




comfortable and almost self- 
directive. There was nothing 
to do. 

He decided to check his 
equipment. The Shogleet, en- 
grossed in the tortuous lan- 
guage of Mallory, was inter- 
rupted by its ward, who came 
bearing a long and shining 
rod tipped with a razor-edged 
blade. 

“This thing,” he said. “It’s 
a lance, isn’t it? And there’s 
another thing, like a big blade 
with a cross-bar and a hand- 
grip. A sword?” 

“I would think so. There 
should be armor, also. I gather 
you are to masquerade as a 
knight. From the literature, 
it seems there actually was a 
knight named Sir Lancelot.” 

“That’s so. My Dad used to 
tell about him. Oh, Hugard 
knew what he was doing when 
he picked me for this mission ! 
Fate, that’s what it is.” The 
Shogleet had other views, but 
kept discreetly silent about 
them. 'v 

“The concept of a vivarium 
culture interests me,” it said. 
“Apparently not all men seek 
change, only a small percen- 
tage?" 

“That’s so,” Lancelot nod- 
ded, sagely. “The happy man 
is the adjusted man. Knows 
what he’s good at and where 
he belongs, and gets on with 
it. Like me, for instance. Nat- 
ural born adventurer — and 
here I am.” 

“But you were originally a 
station-keeper. A mistake?” 

44 



“Oh, no. Psycho-dynamics 
is infallible. That station- 
keeper job was just a starter, 
so that I could work up.” 
The Shogleet, knowing full 
well that Lancelot knew noth- 
ing at all about the science of 
psycho - dynamics, wished it 
had asked for a tape on that. 
It was curious to see how the 
technique would work out on 
a whole planet seeded with 
one psycho-type. 

Eventually, warning bells 
gave tongue and their little 
ship went down, on a guide 
beacon, over a green and 
peaceful world, dotted with 
islands, laced with blue sea, 
into a small glade ringed with 
rugged hills. It was just on 
sunrise, on a glorious spring 
morning. 

Lancelot breathed deep of 
unfiltered air and the sweet 
scent of growing things, and 
found an immediate complaint 
to make. 

E’RE about a hundred 
▼V miles away from the 
chief city, Camlan,” he said, 
as he frowned at a map. “And 
no transport. I mean, that kit 
I have to wear, it’s a weight. 
It’s not going to be easy just 
getting it on, much less walk- 
ing.” 

“According to the accounts,” 
the Shogleet said. “A knight 
rode something. A steed, I 
believe, or horse. What is a 
horse, Lancelot?” 

“Damned if I know. I vague- 
ly recall drawings, when I was 

JOHN RACKHAM 




a kid. Sort of big animal,If%r 
legs, head at one end, tail 1 * at 
the other. But stop a bit, that 
explains something — ” and 
he lugged out some massive 
pieces of metal-work. ‘These 
had me baffled, but they must 
be horse-armor. And this 
thing is a seat, to go on its 
back, 1 guess.” 

“I shall have to approxi- 
mate,” the Shogleet decided. 
“From your memories, and 
what I have read, 1 will trans- 
form myself into a horse.” 

“All right, but give me a 
hand with this hardware first. 
I can't get it on alone. In fact, 
I don't see how it can all go 
on one man!” 

But, with patience and 
struggling, trial and error, 
they got the pieces that a 
skilled synthesist had fabri- 
cated from the patterns of 
museum relics buckled, strap- 
ped and locked about Lancelot. 

His guess had been good. 
He could hardly hold upright 
under the load of metal. 

“How the hell does any- 
body hop about,” he complain- 
ed, making a few labored 
steps, “and swing a sword in 
this lot? It's not possible!” 

The Shogleet paid no atten- 
tion. It was busy on its own 
accou nt. Swallowing great 
quantities of air and energy, 
and speeding its metabolism 
to a great rate, it was con- 
verting its mass to a some- 
thing that would fit that 
armor. Lancelot, shambling 
round, gave advice according 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



to Els Blurred memories. Then, 
struggling mightily, he hoist- 
ed up the pieces one at a time, 
and then, the saddle. Sweat 
was dribbling into his boots 
by the time he was done. 

“Hell! This is a day's work 
by itself,” he groaned, bash- 
ing his helmet in a vain at- 
tempt to wipe away the sweat 
from his brow. “There must 
be an easier way.” 

“I imagine,” the Shogleet- 
horse guessed, “that this is 
why the knight had a squire, 
as it says in the tapes.” Lan- 
celot grunted his heartfelt 
agreement at this, hung the 
blank shield on a saddle-hook, 
the sword and sheath on the 
opposite side, stood the long 
lance by a handy tree, and 
eased his visor down past his 
nose, which was already raw 
from the first, light-hearted 
try. 

Then he eyed the stirrups. 

“You'll have to kneel,” he 
said. “I'll never make it up 
there.” 

He climbed aboard gingerly, 
and they left the glade at a 
sedate walk. “First thing,” he 
said firmly, “we get a squire. 
I'll never make it to Camlan 
at this rate.” 

“Very well,” the Shogleet 
agreed, trying to work out a 
method of progress that would 
not unseat Lancelot. It com- 
promised on a rubber-legged 
shamble which carried them at 
a smooth glide through what 
it assumed was a “woody 
glen.” Half an hour of this 

45 




brought them to a clearing, 
laid out in a chessboard of 
little fields, with a huddle of 
timber shacks in the center. 
Their arrival was the signal 
for a bedlam of shouts, 
screams and f ran tics barking 
from a horde of half -wild dogs. 

The uproar lasted only a 
second or two. Then all was 
silent, apart from furtive rus- 
tlings in the nearby bushes. 

“Where did everybody go?” 
Lancelot demanded, grabbing 
the saddle-horn. “How am I 
going to round up a squire, 
if they all run off like that? 
No, wait — there’s one, over 
by that tree.” 

H E was an old man, grizzle- 
haired and cramped with 
rheumatic stiffness. In his 
simple brown smock, he clung 
to the tree and trembled at 
their gliding approach. Lan- 
celot let go the saddle-horn 
and tried to sit up, impres- 
sively. 

“Ho, there !” he called. “Why 
did everyone run away?” 
“Marry, fair sir,” the old- 
ster mumbled, cringing. “It 
would have been at sight of 
the strange beast thou ridest. 
No mortal eye ever saw such 
a mount before.” 

“What's wrong with me?” 
the Shogleet demanded curi- 
ously. “Isn’t a horse like this?” 
“Now strike me dead!” the 
peasant blanched, clutching 
the tree. “It spoke like a 
Christian. I heard it!” 

“Naturally,” Lancelot said 



grandly. “’Tis a magic steed, 
just as I am a holy knight. I 
have need of a squire. Call the 
others, that I may choose.” 
“Nay, noble sir, we are but 
humble peasants. Wilt find no 
squire here.” 

“Oh, blast!” Lancelot re- 
lapsed into Galactic in his irri- 
tation. Then, with strained 
patience, “Where then shall a 
knight find himself a squire?” 
“The Baron Deorham has 
many such,” the old man of- 
fered. “Steeds, too, though 
none such as thou ridest. But 
he is a wonderly wroth man, 
and a great warrior. He will 
surely attack thee, an thou 
come near him.” 

“Fear not for me, old man. 
I am Sir Lancelot. I will to 
Deorham.” 

“Lancelot! Now am I dead 
and in hell, forsooth. Lancelot 
is legend!” 

“Never mind . that. Just 
point the way, you old fool.” 
The old man cringed again, 
and wobbled a shaky arm in 
the direction of a rough track. 
The Shogleet went into its 
gliding run again. 

“A pity I couldn’t get him 
to put me right on this shape,” 
it said. “I must study a real 
horse at the first opportunity.” 
“This feels all right,” Lan- 
celot argued. “Still, I suppose 
you’re right. It won't do to 
scare the locals out of their 
wits all the time . Say, that 
looks a likely place.” 

They had broken clear of 
trees, and before them the 



46 



JOHN RACKHAM 




grass went away in a slow 
rise to a hill, where there was 
a massive gray building. “Just 
let me do the talking. Appar- 
ently horses aren’t supposed 
to talk.” He clutched the sad- 
dle-horn valiantly, and they 
went on at a fair speed. 

Suddenly the Shogleet sens- 
ed life and movement nearby, 
and swung round. 

“What did you do that for?” 
Lancelot demanded, clinging 
desperately. Then he saw what 
the Shogleet had detected. 
About seventy yards away, 
just rounding an outflung 
clump of trees, came three rid- 
ers. On either side the figures 
were slight, but the man in 
the center was gross, his steed 
huge, his armor bright in the 
sun. His shield bore the device 
of a mailed fist, and his lance 
carried a fluttering blue plume 
at its tip. 

“That’s what I want,” Lan- 
celot muttered. “A picture on 
my shield and a flag on my 
stick. Then they’ll know who 
I am.” 

“So that,” the Shogleet mur- 
mured, interestedly, “is what 
a horse is like.” And it dis- 
creetly began modifying its 
shape. “We should keep still,” 
it advised. “Let him come to 
us. I want to see that creature 
move.” 

As if in answer to the 
thought the big man put up a 
mailed fist. They distinctly 
heard the click of his visor as 
it snapped into place. Then he 
applied his heels to his mount 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



and began thundering at them 
over the turf. 

44T OOK at him go!” Lan- 

-L* celot said, admiringly. 
“I must learn to ride like 
that.” The mighty figure thun- 
dered nearer, and Lancelot 
grew uneasy. “He’ll never be 
able to stop in time,” he mut- 
tered. “Not at that clip. Now 
what’s the fool up to?” — for 
the stranger had dropped his 
lance to the horizontal, and 
the point was aimed straight 
at Lancelot. The Shogleet, 
ever curious, stood quite still. 

“Hey! You lunatic! Point 
that thing the other way !” 
Lancelot yelled. But it was 
obvious even to him that the 
other had no intention of do- 
ing any such thing. At the last 
minute, he managed to fumble 
up his shield. There was a 
rending crash as point met 
shield, fair and square. Lance- 
lot shot backwards over the 
Shogleet’s cruppers, to land 
with a jarring thud on the 
ground. The Shogleet spun 
round, to watch as the yoilng 
man groaned, sat up and then 
struggled to his feet. 

“Art unhorsed!” the stran- 
ger roared. “Dost yield?” 

“Yield nothing,” Lancelot 
gasped, indignantly. “I wasn’t 
even fighting. You want to 
give a bit of notice, next time 
you do something like that. 
Charging up like that without 
so much as a word . .” and 
that was as far as he got. The 
strange knight, backing up 

47 




and tossing away his shattered 
lance, had yanked out his 
sword. Putting heels to his 
horse again, he tore up to 
where Lancelot stood. His 
blade rose and fell mightily, 
and a clang echoed across the 
meadow. Lancelot went down 
on his knees, hung there a 
moment and then kneeled 
over, groaning. The Shogleet 
trotted to where he lay and 
nuzzled him. 

“You must get up and fight,” 
it murmured. “I believe you 
are liable to be taken captive 
otherwise.” 

“Fight !” Lancelot mumbled. 
“I’m half-killed already. That 
damned lunatic should be put 
away.” He sat up and banged 
his mailed fist on his helmet 
to clear his head. The knight 
backed off a yard or two, 
waiting. 

“Get up, quickly,” the Shog- 
leet encouraged, and knelt. 
This sent the knight’s horse 
into a rearing frenzy, giving 
Lancelot time to mount — and 
time to get annoyed, also. 

“All right,” he growled. 
“Wants a fight, does he? We’ll 
see about that.” He unsheath- 
ed his sword with an effort 
The strange knight crouched, 
setting his horse into another 
gallop. At the critical mo- 
ment, he stood up in his saddle 
to give more power to his 
sword-arm. Lancelot heaved 
his shield up, the shock numb- 
ing his arm. then swung blind- 
ly in riposte. 

“Turn round,” he ordered, 
48 



as the knight charged past. 
“Let me have another bash 
at him. I only nicked him that 
time.” 

“You may kill him, you 
know.” 

“And what d'you fancy he’s 
been trying to do to me? I’m 
black and blue all over. Let me 
have another crack at him, I 
said !” 

“Wouldn’t it be wiser to ask 
him to yield? In that way, we 
might get some information, 
which we sadly need.” Lance- 
lot grumbled under his breath, 
but when he saw that his cas- 
ual swipe had sheared the 
knight’s helmet-spike, and 
split his shield in half, he 
agreed reluctantly. 

“Ho, knight,” he called, and 
waved his sword. “Wilt yield?” 

“To a foul fiend from the 
pit?” the knight roared, toss- 
ing away his ruined shield and 
bent sword. “Never! Pit thy 
sorcery against this !” And he 
unhooked from his saddle a 
short length of heavy chain, 
ending in an iron ball studded 
with vicious spikes. Once 
again, he came thundering 
forward. 

“There!” Lancelot gasped. 
“I said the man was raving. 
If he catches me with that 
thing, I'm a dead duck.” 

He put up his shield and 
peered round it warily. The 
spiked ball flailed through the 
air and crashed full on the 
shield, slamming the young 
man over to an extreme angle. 
In sudden, blind rage, he 

JOHN RACKHAM 




swung back, lashed out with 
the sword, felt it bite into 
something. Then, as the Shog- 
leet bridled off, he looked back, 
and his stomach squirmed. 

The super-hard, razor-keen 
blade had sliced through ar- 
mor and knight, from shoul- 
der to groin. There was blood 
everywhere. 

Ill 



44npHE fool would have it,” 
A he muttered. “Now 
there’ll be trouble.” 

But the body was hardly 
flopped to rest before the two 
attendants rode up, slid from 
their mounts and went down, 
each on a knee, heads bowed. 

“Spare me, Sir Knight,” 
they said, in unison. “I am 
thy servant.” 

“They’re only kids,” Lance- 
lot said, surprised. “What are 
your names?” 

“I am hight Alaric,” said 
the ginger one, on the left. 

“And I, Ector,” the other 
added, shaking his long yel- 
low locks. “How shall we call 
thee, Lord?” The Shogleet felt 
Lancelot brace up and stiffen. 

“I am Sir Lancelot!” he 
announced. They promptly 
flat on their faces. “Oh, get 
up!” he said, irritably. “I’m 
not going to eat you. Now, 
one’s to be my squire, and the 
other to look after my horse. 
Which way do you want it?” 
“The horse!” they said, to- 
gether and at once. 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



“That won’t be necessary,” 
the Shogleet said, forgetting. 
“I can look after myself quite 
well.” Again the two youths 
fell to the ground, shaking and 
white. 

“Get up !” Lancelot shouted. 
“How can I get anything done 
if you keep passing out, all 
the time? Now, what happens 
about him?” 

“Thy liege-men will attend 
to it, Lord,” said Alaric, in a 
shaky voice. 

“My liege-men?” 

“But certainly. Hast slain 
Deorham. That which was his 
is now thine.” 

“Oh !” Lancelot looked round. 
“Castle and all? Well, that’s 
handy. And that was Deor- 
ham, was it? All right, one 
of you nip off and tell the gang 
the boss is coming home, hun- 
gry . and bruised, too !” 

“I will. Lord!” Alaric fled 
for his horse and raced on 
ahead. 

The Shogleet contented it- 
self with a modest canter, 
finding the new movement in- 
triguing. Lancelot was not im- 
pressed. 

“You’re shaking me to a 
jelly,” he groaned. “Can’t we 
go back to the other way?” 

“This is more accurate. You 
had better learn. You/ may 
have to ride a real horse some 
day.” Lancelot forgot to grum- 
ble as they reached the court- 
yard of the castle, and he 
could appreciate the size of 
the place. He slid off, and 
stood agape at high rough- 

49 




scone walls and towers, their 
slit-windows innocent of glass, 
but with gay cloths trailing 
from every vantage point. Ec- 
tor approached, unwillingly, 
to take the Shogleet’s bridle. 
Lancelot objected at once. 

“You can’t go off and leave 
me, not now. What’ll I do? I 
mean, you know more than 
me about all the customs and 
things.’’ 

“It will be quite all right,” 
the Shogleet consoled him in 
Galactic, ignoring the flabber- 
gasted stares of the men-at- 
arms who had drawn near. 
“Just give orders. Tell them 
what you want. I will join 
you as soon as I can.” 

It went with Ector to a 
great low stable, where there 
were many half-wild horses 
and a great smell. As soon as 
it could be alone^ it cast off 
the horse-shape. It had given 
a degree of thought to this, 
and decided it was best to as- 
sume some human-like form. 
So, on its rapid transit through 
the stables, courtyard and into 
the great hall, it settled into 
a small, dark-hued, manikin 
shape, thinking to be less im- 
pressive and thus less fright- 
ening in that guise. 

Trotting through the serfs 
who were busy scattering 
fresh rushes on the stone-slab 
floor, it found Lancelot seated 
at the head of a long, rude 
table, on which more serfs 
were arranging platters heap- 
ed with hot food. He was deep 
in conversation with an old, 

50 



rugged-looking, gray-bearded 
man, but looked up as the 
Shogleet came close and 
scrambled on to the arm of 
his chair. 

WrpHIS is Gildas,” he said. 

-I “Calls himself a senes- 
chal. Sort of head-man. Been 
telling me all about the prop- 
erty.” 

Gildas backed off warily. 

“Now, sooth,” he muttered. 
“I do believe thou art Lance- 
lot, and this thy familiar. 
What is it, a troll?” 

“Lancelot,” the Shogleet 
said, in Galactic. “Have you 
forgotten? We are on a mis- 
sion? You should be asking 
Gildas for news of the emer- 
gency.” 

“Say, that’s right. I’d for- 
gotten. It’s not every day a 
man gets a barony.” He turn- 
ed in his chair. “Draw near, 
Gildas. There is nothing to 
fear.” 

“Thou sayest it well, Lord,” 
Gildas growled, “but. I like it 
not. A troll that stands and 
parleys like a man. Still, it is 
but part and parcel with the 
strange things that have come 
on this land but lately.” 

“Ah, now, that’s what I 
wanted to know about. What’s 
going on? I have to know, 
because I'm here to stop it.” 
Gildas stepped back, trans- 
formed from a sullen gray- 
beard into an angry enemy. 

“I knew it!” he roared. “I 
knew thou wert false! I will 
hail the men-at-arms, that 

JOHN RACKHAM 




they may cut thee down. Nay, 
strike me dead an thou canst, 
but I will say it.” 

“Oh, lord!” Lancelot mut- 
tered. “What now? For heav- 
en's sake, man, I’m not going 
to strike anybody dead. Not 
again. I’ve had enough of that 
for one day. Just get a grip 
on yourself and tell me what 
it’s all about.” 

“Methinks yon troll doth 
already know, and the ques- 
tion is but a trap. Natheless, 
I will tell. Ye wit well there 
is but one great sin in this 
land. It is hight ‘Change.’ The 
wise ones tell us this is the 
best of all worlds, and that it 
is sin to think otherwise. So 
all say, where it can be heard. 
But who can say what a man 
thinketh in his heart? To la- 
bor and sweat and garner the 
fruits of the land is the old 
way, the honest way. But who 
will labor and sweat when his 
fields may be ploughed, sown, 
aye, and garnered into his 
barn, without he turn a hand? 
This be a change that many 
welcome.” 

“I haven’t the foggiest idea 
what you’re going on about,” 
Lancelot confessed. “Don’t tell 
me the sky is going to fall 
over a few ploughed fields? 
I was thinking of gathering 
some of those lads out there 
to ride with me to Camlan — ” 

“Camlan !” Gildas leaped 
back again, surprisingly spry 
for one of his age. “Again I 
say ye are false !” And he had 
his mouth open to shout as 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



Lancelot jumi>ed up and seiz- 
ed him. 

“Stop it!” he yelled. “I’m 
getting sick of this double- 
talk. Why the hell can’t you 
come right out and say what 
you mean?” He turned to the 
Shogleet, with Gildas dangling 
chokingly from his mailed 
fists. “Can you make any sense 
out of it? I think they’re all 
stark raving mad here.” 

The Shogleet eyed Gildas. 
“Put him down,” it said. 
“Now, what land is this, and 
who is your king?” 

“This is Brython,” Gildas 
said, squeakily, “and our king 
hight Cadman. Soon to be 
Cadman of the Fiery Dragon, 
in sooth. He dwells in Alban, 
twenty miles south. If ye be 
the wise troll, advise this your 
master to ride to Cadman and 
plead to aid, on our side!” 
“I’m beginning to get it,” 
Lancelot sighed “What’s Cam- 
lan then?” 

“Camlan is for Bors, King 
of the Kellat, and our deadly 
foe. Even now doth he call an 
army of knights, to invade our 
land and seize our dragon. To 
destroy it, he claims, but many 
suspect it is but to capture it 
for his own use.” 

“Oh, come now. A real dra- 
gon?” 

“It is sooth, Lord. I myself 
have seen it, and my eyes were 
weak for a day after. It is 
truly a fearsome thing for an 
enemy. But for us it be great 
good. It is strange, and we all 
fear it, but who can argue 

51 




against a full barn and tilled 
fields, all without labor?" 

66 A DRAGON which labors 
-rV in the field? That would 
be something really worth see- 
ing, Lancelot. The tapes said 
nothing of this.” 

“A dragon!" Lancelot mur- 
mured, dreamily. “That would 
be right up my street. All 
right, Gildas, we’ll leave the 
question of politics for a bit. 
Shove some of that grub my 
way, would you? And pass 
some tools.” Gildas frowned 
at this. 

“There are no eating imple- 
ments in this culture, Lance- 
lot," the Shogleet advised, 
drawing on its studies. “Dag- 
ger and fingers only.” 

Before Lancelot could voice 
his grumble, Gildas said, “Wilt 
permit thy wives now, Lord?" 

“My what? How do I come 
to have wives?” 

“They were Deorham's, are 
now thine. They wait thy leave 
to come to table." 

"Good grief! Now I have a 
couple of wives." 

“Nay, Lord. Six." 

Lancelot shrank into his 
glittering armor. He cast an 
appealing eye on the Shogleet. 
“What do I do now? Six 
wives! One w'o'uld be too 
many.” 

“Ask Gildas," the Shogleet 
advised. “He will know. There 
was nothing in the tapes about 
such a situation, so I cannot 
help you." 

“Here a minute,” Lancelot 
THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



gulped. “I have been long in 
the grave and forget many 
customs of this land. What 
shall I do with these — wo- 
men? What are they all for, 
anyway? And why six?” 
“Marry, Lord, but I under- 
stand thee not. A man may 
take as many wives as he 
needs and can support, if he 
be a knight. And what would 
a wife be for, but to serve? 
Still, it matters not, now. If 
thou art truly for our cause, 
then must eat and depart 
forthwith. All is to hand. We 
can fetch Alban by nightfall.” 
“What, right away?” 

“All is to hand,” Gildas re- 
peated firmly. “Even this day 
did Deorham make ready for 
the journey, to join Cadman 
and all the other great knights 
of this land, against the Kel- 
lat. Else thou wouldst not have 
found him in the meadow, 
where he did but try out his 
armor and steed.” Lancelot 
groaned and looked about fe- 
verishly. The Shogleet, watch- 
■ ing, saw him shudder. 

“I’m up a tree this time. I 
can’t face a twenty-mile drag, 
not after what I’ve just had 
from the Baron. I ache, I tell 
you. But I don’t fancy all these 
women hanging about either. 
I’m caught both ways.” 

“The Lady Phillipa hath the 
healing touch,” Gildas offer- 
ed. “If thou wilt shed thy 
mail, Lord, she will attend 
thee.” And he clapped his 
hands before Lancelot could 
stop him. 



53 




They came in at once. The 
Shogleet suspected they had 
been close at hand, listening. 
At any rate, there was no need 
to warn the Lady Phillipa that 
her services were needed. A 
large and robust woman of 
some thirty years, she made at 
once for the hapless knight 
and, with Gildas assisting, had 
him out of his mail as readily 
as a mother undresses a child, 
and with as little concern. 

It was the Shogleet’s first 
contact with women at close 
quarters and it was intensely 
interested in this new phe- 
nomenon. What it found par- 
ticularly puzzling was Lance- 
lot’s obvious awkwardness, as 
if he was afraid the females 
might see the body that had 
been built for him. This was 
not the behavior-pattern that 
it had traced in Lancelot in the 
beginning. According to that, 
he was lordly and quietly 
compelling in the presence of 
the opposite" sex. It began to 
suspect that this, too, had 
been part of the young man’s 
fantasies. It was all very 
strange. 

H ALF an hour later, on a 
real horse, into the saddle 
of which Lancelot had been 
hoisted by a primitive block- 
and-tackle arrangement and 
three sweating serfs, the 
young man led a great rout 
from the castle courtyard. On 
his arm, the Shogleet listened 
keenly to the chatter of the 
men around. A few were 

54 



mounted, most were afoot, and 
they all were filled with en- 
thusiasm for the battle ahead. 
But, of the dragon, there 
were divided opinions. Some 
thought it a blessing,, a gift 
from the gods to a deserving 
country, but they were in a 
minority. The rest devoutly 
believed that it was evil. The 
right and proper thing for a 
man was to work or to fight, 
they declared. What man could 
do either, when a dragon did 
both so much better than any 
man? Not so, they said, and 
this legendary knight was 
come, for sure, to rid them 
of it. 

Lancelot, jogging along in 
his armor, was acting and 
talking in anything but a 
knightly manner, but the 
Shogleet paid him little heed. 
Disguished under the mini- 
strations of Lady Phillipa, it 
had managed to help him with 
doses of carefully tuned ener- 
gy. The young man was as 
good as new, except in spirit, 
in which region he was badly 
bruised. 

“I shall never keep this up 
for twenty miles,” he groan- 
ed, as his teeth jarred and 
clicked at every pace. “I’m a 
nervous wreck, I tell you. If 
this is knivht errantry, then 
I’ve had it.” They made a 
good twenty miles an hour, 
and should have fetched Al- 
ban in two hours. But it was 
nearer five, and the sun low- 
ering in the sky, before the 
roofs of the city came in sight. 

JOHN RACKHAM 




Then the Shogleet recalled, 
from its studies, the low level 
of education consistent with 
this culture. Few of these peo- 
ple could count as far as twen- 
ty. For them, forty was well- 
nigh an infinite number. 

Over the bridge and into 
the narrow streets of Alban, 
Lancelot was pushed into the 
lead. The Shogleet sharpened 
its senses for more informa- 
tion about the dragon. There 
were whispers on all sides 
about the “knight with the 
naked shield” and “how his 
armor doth glitter, like sil- 
ver,” but not a mention of the 
mysterious beast. In the cen- 
ter of the city they came to 
the castle. The crowd of idle 
sightseers gave way to a 
great throng of men-at-arms, 
knights, squires. 

They came to the foot of a 
great flight of steps. 

“That’s it,” Lancelot said, 
with resigned conviction. 
“Just let me fall off right here. 
I’m through." 

But Alaric had spurred his 
mount forward, just as a 
tall, gray-headed man, with a 
heavily - lined, strong face, 
came to the head of the steps. 

“ Your Majesty,” the squire 
cried in a high but quite audi- 
ble voice. “I am squire to this 
knight. This day hath he slain 
Deorham in a great battle. 
Whereupon, and without stay 
for rest, hath he ridden right 
speedily, with this great com- 
pany, to offer service with 
thee against thine enemy. 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



Your Majesty, this is Sir 
Lancelot!” 

The Shogleet could hear the 
great gasp which ran through 
the crowd at this awesome 
name. Even the King himself 
seemed to shrink a little. 

“It is, indeed, a great hon- 
or,” he said uneasily, “to have 
such a great one return from 
the shades to serve in our 
cause. Dismount, Sir Lance- 
lot. Approach and be welcom- 
ed to our presence.” Lancelot 
crawled wearily fronvthe sad- 
dle. He stood on shaky legs, 
looked up the steps and began 
to climb. 

But the Shogleet, with its 
razor-keen senses, had caught 
something highly irregular. 
Alaric had gone on, to keep 
one pace to the rear of Lance- 
lot, while Ector stayed to hold 
the horse. 

“Ector!” the Shogleet hiss- 
ed, becoming part-visible for 
the purpose. “See you that 
man in the brown jerkin and 
the cap over his eyes, there 
close by the knight in the fal- 
con shield?” Ector peered, and 
nodded. 

“Mark him. Discover what 
you can. When the moment is 
ripe, have word with him. and 
say Lancelot has need of him. 
Have him come.” 

“And if he will not come. 
Lord?” 

“Whisper in his ear this 
word. It is a great magic, so 
forget it not. The word is 
‘Galactopol.’ Hearing it, he 
will come.” 



55 




IV 



E CTOR repeated the word 
fearfully, and went off 
with the horse. The Shogleet 
scurried up the steps, its curi- 
osity-damping field going full 
blast. Lancelot was wearily 
explaining to King Cadman 
that he had travelled far and 
fast, and that all he wanted 
to do, right then and there, 
was to rest. 

“They must be made of 
steel and leather,” he com- 
plained bitterly, in the cham- 
ber that had been assigned to 
him, as Alaric helped him un- 
buckle his armor. “Believe it 
or not, but that crowd down 
there are just getting set for 
an all-night session. Drinking, 
carousing and eating. Moun- 
tains of food. Entertainers 
standing by. Women all over 
the place. Don’t they ever get 
tired?” The squire was sent 
off for bread and wine and a 
bowl of hot water, and the 
Shogleet soon had Lancelot 
easier in body. But his spirits 
were well down. 

“I’m a flop at this game,” 
he gloomed. “All right, I’ve 
turned up a dragon. But sup- 
pose I can’t fight it? And sup- 
pose I do? I still don’t know 
what the emergency is all 
about, and I’ve no idea how to 
start looking. I’m a duff, I tell 
you. Best thing I can do is go 
back to Director Hugard and 
turn in my badge.” 
“Patience,” the Shogleet 
counseled. “I think Ector may 
have news for us. Ah, here 
he is now.” 

56 



E CTOR had found his man. 

Lancelot looked, indiffer- 
ently. 

“Who might you be?” he 
asked. 

“That’s a good question,” 
the stranger replied crisply. 
“I was going to ask the same 
thing. Who the hell are you? 
And what’s the big idea of 
riding around in that fake 
chrome - silicon - steel armor, 
hey?” 

“That’s it,” the Shogleet 
nodded, shimmering into full 
visibility. “That’s what I 
heard you say, down there by 
the steps.” The man in brown 
stepped back carefully, blinked 
a time or two and swallowed. 

“I don’t believe it,” he said. 
“I see it. I hear it. A little 
brown pixy, with red eyes, 
talking Galactic. But I don’t 
believe it.” 

“Hey!” Lancelot sat up, 
painfully. “That’s a point, too. 
You’re talking Galactic. Who 
are you, anyway?” 

“He is obviously a Galacto- 
pol agent,” the Shogleet said 
patiently. “The real point is, 
why is he here? Why would 
they send two agents?” 

“Two agents?” The stran- 
ger stared, then pushed his 
cap back. “I'm beginning to 
get it, I think. Heard of you, 
haven’t I? Lancelot Lake?” 
“That’s right. And you?” 
“Oh, I’m just a third-level 
sector man. Name’s Alfred 
North. Pass myself off as a 

' JOHN RACKHAM 




journeyman blacksmith here. 
It’s a living, with all the armor 
about. That’s how I could spot 
your stuff. Nothing here to 
even scratch that. You’d be a 
pay-off bet in a tourney.” 

“No fear!” Lancelot said, 
hastily. “I’ve had all I want of 
that. But what is this all a- 
bout? What’s the emergency?” 
“It’s a dilly, all right.” 
North fished out a case, of- 
fered it. “Smoke?” 

“Thanks!” Lancelot’s eyes 
shone, until he recalled the 
squires. “How about them, 
then? Won’t they mind?” 
“It'll scare them, but they’ll 
write it off as magic. That’s 
a handy way to cover up any- 
thing you don’t understand. 
That’s why they can take the 
dragon so easily.” 

“There really is a dragon, 
then?” 

“But surely. You mean you 
didn’t know? It’s had me stop- 
ped, I can tell you. I was 
thinking of screaming for spe- 
cial aid. How come you’re 
here, if you don’t know about 
it?” 

“I gues3 I’m your special 
aid. I only got here this mor- 
ning, and I can’t seem to keep 
still long enough to find out 
anything that makes sense.” 
North frowned, then shrug- 
ged resignedly. “I suppose you 
special boys have your own 
methods. Anyway, I’d say you 
have the right approach in 
this case. We usually work 
under cover, but this one isn't 
like that at all. When the 



alarm went off, I wasn’t both- 
ered — ” 

“That alarm,” the Shogleet 
interrupted. “I am curious 
about that. Is it some form 
of automatic device?” 

North sighed. “I was hop- 
ing you’d go away, if I didn’t 
pay any attention.- Ah, well.” 
He inhaled thoughtfully. “You 
see, when these planets are 
colonized, they implant the 
compatible beliefs as a dogma. 
But, just to take care of any 
sports, there’s a ritual, a form 
of exorcism, that is triggered 
off by any major change. And 
that fires the alarm. Doesn’t 
happen very often. It’s usu- 
ally a gene-twist. Some kid 
gets curious about the stars 
up there, or begins to fiddle 
about with experiments in 
steam-pressure. That kind of 
thing. But this one is dif- 
ferent.” 

“A real dragon?” Lancelot 
asked, wide-eyed. 

64nnHAT would be the day,” 
A North grinned. Then he 
sneaked a look at the Shogleet, 
and his grin slipped a little. 
“No,” he said, stubbing out 
his smoke-tube. “If you think 
back a couple of hundred 
years, when they were terra- 
forming this planet, they used 
machinery. Big stuff. One gad- 
get was a combined cultivator- 
harvester. Thorium powered, 
and just about everlasting. 
They used hundreds of ’em. 
And somebody goofed. One got 
left behind, in a cave they 



THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



57 




were using for storage space. 
Now, after all these years, one 
of the local boys has found it. 
He’s using it.” 

“Hold on,” Lancelot object- 
ed. “He wouldn’t know how.” 

“That’s the hell of it. He 
wouldn’t have to; I’ve check- 
ed. The thing is run from a 
mentrol — a sort of head- 
band, with trimmings. You 
put it on, and think your or- 
ders, like ‘stop,’ ‘go,’ ‘right,’ 
‘left,’ ‘fast,’ and ‘slow.’ And 
what more do you want? The 
way I figure it, somebody must 
have found the mentrol and 
tried it on for size, and that 
started the whole thing off.” 

“Yeeow!” Lancelot gasped. 
“He must have had the hell 
of a fright when it came rum- 
bling out of its cave. But it 
all fits. The way they lap up 
magic here, it wouldn’t be any 
trouble for them to spot that 
whoever wears the mentrol 
controls the beast. Which is 
right, anyway. Who owns it 
now?” 

“That's Sir Brian de Boyce. 
Next to old Cadman, he’s the 
big boy in these parts. The 
way I heard it, one of his 
freemen found the mentrol, so 
Sir Brian eliminated him, and 
took charge. And it’s ruining 
the economy. There isn’t a 
peasant in miles who’s put his 
back into his job in months. 
I’m stymied. I’m only a free- 
man here. I can’t just charge 
in and tell Sir Brian what to 
do. But you can. You’re a 
knight.” 

58 



“That’s all right,” Lancelot 
mused, “but how do I get it 
from him?” 

“You’ll fight him for it, of 
course.” Lancelot fell back. 

“Oh, no ! I’m not having any 
more of that,” he groaned. 
“You didn’t see what Deor- 
ham did to me. I can show you 
the bruises — ” 

“Come off it.” Noah was 
curt. “If you took a stroll 
down to the main hall right 
now, you’d find that they’re 
working out the list for the big 
fight, in the morning. No, not 
against Bors and his boys. 
Against each other.” 

“Eh? What for?” 

“It’s the culture pattern. 
Trial by combat. Knights fight 
for rank, prestige. Cadman 
wouldn’t dream of leading a 
field of knights unless they 
had all been graded by prow- 
ess. That’s how it’s done. The 
winners qualify; the losers 
flunk out. I’ll bet you there’s 
a dozen down there right now, 
just aching to have a crack 
at you. You can call yourself 
Sir Lancelot. But they’ll want 
you to prove it. And you can’t 
refuse, either; if you chicken 
out, your name will smell. 
Even a serf will spit on you.” 
“Oh lord !” Lancelot sat up, 
jmd r»nt his head in his hands. 
“I wish I’d never seen this 
place. What the hell am I go- 
ing to do?” 

“Your best bet is to lash out 
with a challenge to Sir Brian, 
rio'ht away. If you’re lucky, 
and he’s free to take you on, 

JOHN RACKHAM 




then all you have to do is chop 
him down, and you’re top man 
— and the mentrol is yours. 
You’d better be quick. The 
competition is fierce.” 



1MTASQUERADING as a 
■L*-!- horse again, the Shogleet 
carried Lancelot through the 
busy streets, early the next 
morning. It was of the opinion 
that Lancelot had been rea- 



sonably fortunate. He had 
drawn one strange knight 
from the far west, called 
Gnut, an unknown about 
whom fantastic stories were 



rife. 



“Discounting the tales,” it 
argued, “for these people have 
only the vaguest ideas of accu- 
racy, you are fortunate. You 
will defeat Gnut, then Sir 



Brian, and the mentrol will 
be yours.” 

Lancelot refused to be cheer- 



ed. “I’m sick of this knight 
business,” he muttered. “I 
spend all my time in this 
blasted metal strait- jacket, 



jogging my guts out on a 
horse, people bashing me 
about. Now I’ve got to fight a 
couple of guys I’ve never seen 
before. And if I win what hap- 
pens? Every knight for miles 
around will be waiting to have 
a bash at me to show how good 
he is. And they talk about 
competition in a dynamic cul- 
ture! They don’t know what 
they’re talking about.” 

They were turning the cor- 
ner, by a high-roofed house. 
The Shogleet was pondering 



on the unspoken implication 
in Lancelot’s words. He was 
actually so low in spirit as to 
entertain the thought that he 
might not win! Then there 
came a gentle hail from the 
balcony, and a gay-colored 
scrap of silk fluttered through 
the sunlight, to catch on the 
tip of Lancelot’s lance. 

“Tis a troth. Lord,” Alaric 
said. “Wouldst have me seek 
out its owner?” Then he ex- 
plained, as Lancelot was com- 
pletely fogged. He would enter 
the house find out who had 
tossed the silk, ask for her 
glove, and Lancelot would car- 
ry it into battle. “An thou art 
victorious, Lord, the hand 
which fits the glove is thine. 
It is the custom.” 

“But I’ve got six wives, 
now!” 

“What of that?” Alaric de- 
manded. “Who knoweth what 
treasures may hap, today? I 
know not of Gnut, but Sir 
Brian is a wonderly rich man 
— and all can be thine.” 
“Good grief!” Lancelot 
shuddered. “Doesn’t a man 
ever settle down with just one 
wife here?” 

“To wed, thou meanest? 
Marry, that is a different mat- 
ter. That is the way of a man 
who is old, and would put an 
end to glory and adventure.” 
“Precious few of these lads 
will live so long,” Lancelot 
mumbled. “The way they go 
at it. What do you call ‘old’?” 
Alaric frowned. “I can but 
guess, sire. A great many 



THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



59 




years, certainly. As many as 
thirty." 

The Shogleet was amused 
by Lancelot’s sudden silence. 
It knew he was thirty-three. 
But there was food for 
thought, too. If it was rare for 
a knight to live longer than 
thirty years, then this would 
be a self-control mechanism 
tjo keep down the numbers of 
the non-productive to within 
the capacity of an agricultural 
community. Knighthood, it 
seemed, served the multiple 
function of entertainment, 
hazard, prestige and the skim- 
ming off of the restless few. 

But the wives were an en- 
igma. The Shogleet determine 
ed to question North at the 
first opportunity. 

T HE tournament field was 
riot of color. Gay streamers 
flirted with the breeze from 
the pavilions at either end. 
Each pennant was a knight. 
Tabarded heralds carried ros- 
ters. The chattering populace 
was accommodated on rude 
plank seats along either length 
of the field. In the privileged 
center of one side was the 
royal stand, thick with drapes. 

Alaric was kept busy point- 
ing out the various celebrities, 
reeling off their reputations, 
their possessions, their pedi- 
grees, until even the Shogleet 
marvelled a little at such a 
memory. Then the boy saw Sir 
Brian’s pennant. He indicated 
it. 

“His lands are the most spa- 

60 



cious in Brython, second only 
to the King. Vast herds, great 
forests and three castles.” _ 

“How many wives?" 

“As I heard it last, sire, 
eleven.” 

“Oh, great!" Lancelot sag- 
ged. “That’s a hell of an in- 
centive to win. But if I don’t 
kill him, then he’ll kill me!" 

Bugles rent the chatter, and 
set the pennants rising and 
falling. The contest began. 
Lancelot watched gloomily. 

“Look at that!" he mutter- 
ed to the Shogleet. “Ton and 
a half of raving insanity, trav- 
elling at about thirty miles an 
hour. Double it, because the 
other lunatic is doing the 
same. No wonder they count 
you out if you fall. By the 
time you stop that with your 
belly and fall about five feet 
onto hard ground, plus all the 
hardware, it’s no wonder they 
don’t get up to argue.” 

The pennants rose and fell. 
Trumpets blared. Brass-lung- 
ed heralds told the tally of 
victor and vanquished. Then 
up went a barred black pen- 
nant, with a gold spot. A her- 
ald roared. 

“Sir Gnut, of the Westland 
. to meet Sir Lancelot!” 

Alaric broke out a pure 
white pennant, and the chal- 
lenge was shouted back. 

“Sir Lancelot to meet Sir 
Gnut!" 

The great surf-roar of the 
crowd was stilled as that fab- 
ulous name spread from lip to 
lip. Lancelot settled himself in 

JOHN RACKHAM 




the saddle, and put out a hand 
for the lance which Alaric 
held ready. But the Shogleet 
had already spotted Gnut, at 
the other end. A smallish man, 
in all-black mail, on a small, 
wiry stallion, he looked fast. 

“Leave the lance,” it order- 
ed. “Prepare to use your 
sword.” It cantered on to the 
field before Lancelot could ar- 
gue “Now sit firm. Fend off 
his point with your shield, 
then cut him down with your 
sword.” 

“Who, me?” Lancelot chat- 
tered. “How the blazes can I, 
with you bouncing me about 
like that?” A great yell went 
up from the crowd as the gal- 
lant knight flung his arms 
about the neck of his steed to 
keep from falling off. 

The Shogleet halted. The 
warden’s flag fell. Sir Gnut 
went into his gallop at once, 
head well down, crouching 
over his crouched lance. Lan- 
celot fumbled for his sword. 
The Shogleet braced itself. 
Lance met shield with a rend- 
ing crash, and splintered into 
matchwood. The Shogleet 
pranced backward and round, 
to keep Lancelot in the saddle. 
Gnut was equally nimble, toss- 
ing away the ruined lance and 
whipping out his blade. In and 
out like a snake, he battered 
Lancelot, again and again, 
rocking him in his saddle until 
he was good and angry. 

“All right!” he roared. “You 
asked for it!” And he stood 
in his stirrups, waiting for the 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



black knight to charge in just 
once more. Then the Shogleet 
felt him slash down, viciously 
. and there was a shocked 
Aaah! from the crowd. 

“Serve him right,” Lance- 
lot growled as they trotted 
from the field, and the serfs 
ran on to carry off the sliced 
remains of Sir Gnut. “Let’s 
hope that made Sir Brian stop 
and think a bit.” 

V 

B ACK in his tent there was 
a surprise waiting for 
Lancelot. 

The Shogleet, poking its 
horse-head through the tent 
flap, saw a slim, girlish fig- 
ure, with her glossy gold hair 
done in gleaming braids about 
her head. This was the young- 
est female it had seen. It stud- 
ied her with great interest. 
Her complexion was curiously 
translucent, so that the flush 
of blood in her cheek was 
clearly visible. And her voice 
was soft and low, as she greet- 
ed Lancelot. Alaric, as usual, 
was on hand with explana- 
tions. 

“This is the Lady Jessica, 
sire. She who threw thee the 
silk which thou accepted.” 

“I pray,” she said, softly, 
“that thou’rt willing to ac- 
cept my glove as a gage, Sir 
Knight.” Timidly she held out 
a slim hand. Lancelot took it 
as if it was an eggshell. The 
Shogleet was completely baf- 
fled by his beet-red face and 

61 




the glazed look in his eye. This 
was a side to Lancelot that it 
had not seen before. 

The Lady Jessica had to 
stand on tiptoe to put her face 
to Lancelot's. Then she went 
even more red in the face, and 
whispered, “I pray that thou 
wilt be triumphant, Sir 
Knight — for my sake!” 

Then she was gone, leaving 
Lancelot staring into vacancy 
and rubbing his cheek. North 
pushed his way into the tent, 
grinning. 

“Nice work, Lake,” he said. 
“Not much style, but you 
chopped him down quick.” 

“Here — ” Lancelot said, 
abstractedly. “Something I 
wanted to ask you. This busi- 
ness about wives. I mean, I 
won six from Deorham. Lord 
knows how many Gnut had, 
but Sir Brian has eleven. 
What do I do with all them?” 

“Ah!” North chuckled. 
“You’re a bit mixed, there. 
The word should rightly be 
‘housewives.’ They’re a kind 
of high-class servant. When 
you think about it, there isn’t 
much else a high-born lady 
can do, except run the domes- 
tic side, while the menfolk 
are busy battling. They have 
their duties, you see, like 
keeping track of the hired 
help, tending to the kitchen, 
the bedchamber, the linen — 
that sort of thing. They tend 
to the man of the house, too, 
of course, and entertain his 
guests. But they’re strictly 
property. No need to be both- 

62 



ered, if that's what you’re 
worried about.” 

Lancelot’s face went red 
again. “So there isn’t any reg- 
ular getting married and set- 
tling down, then?” 

“Oh, sure, but that’s a dif- 
ferent thing. For the knight 
who is past his prime and 
wants to settle down. Retire. 
You know. He usually selects 
some old place out in the 
sticks, turns in the rest of his 
property to the King, to be a 
prize for some contender, and 
settles in to raise a family. 
More squires and ladies, and 
the whole thing starts all over 
again. Not many get that far. 
It’s too dull for them. Why?” 
Lancelot was saved his 
stammering explanation by 
the sound of a herald from the 
field. Sir Brian’s pennant had 
gone up. 

“Take the lance this time,” 
the Shogleet decided, studying 
Sir Brian. 

“Good grief!” Lancelot had 
been looking, too. “See the size 
of him! No wonder he’s the 
top man in these parts. He’s 
going to take a bit of knocking 
out.” 

The Shogleet pricked up its 
ears at the sudden change in 
Lancelot’s tone, but it had 
more urgent matters to con- 
sider. “Couch your lance firm- 
ly,” it advised. “Aim for his 
midriff.” The flag fell. They 
began to go forward, from a 
canter into a gallop, Lancelot 
manfully sitting forward and 
forgetting to complain. The 

JOHN RACKHAM 




mighty Sir Brian thundered 
toward them, his lance glitter- 
ing in the sun. At the very 
moment of impact, the Shog- 
leet stiffened, rearing on its 
haunches to keep Lancelot in 
the saddle. There was a deaf- 
ening double clang from the 
shields, a wheeze from Lance- 
lot as the wind was punched 
out of him, the screech of tor- 
tured metal and a gruesome 
gargle from Sir Brian. 

Then, despite all the Shog- 
leet could do, it felt Lancelot 
lifted and dragged from the 
saddle. 

S KIDDING furiously to a 
stop, it wheeled to look. 
There was Lancelot, on foot, 
dazedly clutching the haft of 
the lance. The other end, with 
its razor tip, had stabbed 
through Sir Brian’s shield, his 
armor and Sir Brian himself, 
and stuck out a hand’s breadth 
on the far side. 

With a grunting effort, Lan- 
celot tore the lance free. He 
staggered back as the Shogleet 
cantered up, to kneel so that 
he csould remount. The crowd 
was stunned into momentary 
silence. Then it went wild. 

Even King Cadman looked 
shaken, as they cantered pa^t 
the royal stand for the salute 
and accolade. Back in the tent, 
Lancelot eased himself out of 
his helmet and sat. 

“That’s me,” he said flatly. 
“I’m through, done, finished.” 
North pushed through the 
tent-flap just in time to dis- 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



agree with the last word. 

“There's still the dragon,” 
he said. “That shouldn’t be 
too hard, now that you've won 
the mentrol. Nice bout, that 
was. Just as well you’re not 
staying in these parts. The 
rest of the boys don’t stand a 
chance against you.” 

“It’s the superior metal, 
of course,” the Shogleet com- 
mented, poking itsJhorsehead 
into the tent. North jumped a 
clear foot off the ground, 
knocking his head on the 
wooden spar of the tent. 

“Talking horses, now,” he 
breathed. “Is this routine 
equipment for you Prime G- 
men?” 

“Forget that,” Lancelot 
snapped. “What about this 
dragon? Let’s get it over with, 
and we’ll see whether I’m 
staying here or not.” 

North eyed him thoughtful- 
ly. “I suggest you play it this 
way. There should be a coffee- 
break, soon. You get an audi- 
ence with Cadman. Tell him 
this dragon is a great evil. 
You’ve come to kill it and, 
once done, you'll return to the 
shades. That way, everybody’ll 
be shut up. All right?” 
“Sounds simple enough. But 
tan I kill the thing?” 

“I'll fix that,” North said 
briskly, “once I have the men- 
trol.” He glanced out of the 
tent and chuckled. “Here they 
come now.” 

“Who?” 

“Sir Brian’s crowd. His 
lieges, turning themselves in. 



63 




You want the lad with the 
gadget. Never mind the rest.” 

“Suppose . said Lancelot, 
in a tone that made the Shog- 
feet prick up its ears at once. 
“Suppose I was staying here, 
and I didn’t want all these 
retainers hanging about — 
what’s the routine proced- 
ure?” 

“Nothing to it.” North gave 
him that thoughtful look 
again. “You just manumit 
them. Give ’em their freedom. 
They’ll just go off and sign 
up with somebody else. It’s 
not wise, though, because you 
couldn’t run an estate without 
staff, and they work for their 
keep.” 

“That’s a point,” Lancelot 
admitted. He went to receive 
his spoils with a pensive air. 

Late that afternoon, with 
the awed populace keeping a 
safe distance, the Shogleet 
bore Lancelot, following North 
who was on foot, to the mead- 
ow where the monster “slept.” 
North had the mentrol in his 
hand. 

“This shouldn’t be any 
trouble,” he said. “A bit of 
expert sabotage, and it will be 
all over. There she is, folks.” 

I T was easy to see why the 
peasants had dubbed it a 
dragon. Its sectioned body, all 
of fifty feet long, hugged the 
ground, rising to a twenty- 
foot high hump in front. 
There a single head-lamp grave 
it a one-eyed, evil look. 

“That front scoop,” North 

64 



explained, “can be set to any 
level you like, and there are 
controls which can be adjusted 
so that the stuff is processed, 
inside. Got a rudimentary 
‘brain’ — enough to identify 
and reject organic matter 
that’s still alive. It wouldn’t 
touch a man, even if you tried 
to make it. Not that any of the 
locals would have the nerve 
to chance it. Nor do I blame 
them. Incidentally, it proc- 
esses wastes and makes its 
own bags and fertilizer, all in 
one operation. That’s not do- 
ing the economy any good, 
either, believe me. I’ve been 
stuck because I couldn’t lay 
my hands on this little gadget. 
But now I have it, I know 
that it’s immobile. Nothing 
can happen until I put it on 
my head. Come on.” 

. But the Shogleet had other 
idcES 

“Lancelot,” it said. “You 
had better go back. Warn the 
audience not to come too near. 
And there is someone you 
would wish to see, I think?” 

“That’s right.” Lancelot 
slid down eagerly, and went 
clanking back. 

“You’re a smart animal,” 
North said, shrewdly. “What’s 
on your mind?” 

“Answer me a question, 
first. I gather that there is 
a sort of personal polarity, an 
attraction and an attachment 
between humans of opposite 
sexes, if certain other factors 
are favorable. It involves such 
activities as marrying, set- 

JOHN RACKHAM 




tling down, raising a family 
— all of which are concepts 
which I do not quite under- 
stand. But I believe such re- 
lationships are not amenable 
to reason. Yes?” 

“If you mean that there’s 
neither sense nor reason in a 
guy who’s in love, that’s dead 
right,” North chuckled. “Love 
makes a fool of a man. There’s 
never been a cure for it yet.” 
“That is what I thought. 
Thank you. Now, it is not 
enough that the dragon be 
destroyed. It must be seen to 
be destroyed. Impressively.” 
“It’s a good point. What’s 
on your mind?” 

The Shogleet proceeded to 
tell him, in rapid, explicit de- 
tail. North’s eyes widened. 

“I can do it, sure, if that’-s 
the way you want it. I hope 
you know what you’re doing, 
that's all.” 

He hurried off across the 
meadow, to disappear into the 
gaping jaws of the cultivator. 
Lancelot came, clanking back. 
He had already mounted by 
the time North returned. 

“Let’s get it over with,” he 
said impatiently, dropping his 
visor. “I might as well tell 
you that, as soon as I’ve fin- 
ished with this thing, I’m re- 
tiring from Galactopol. I’m 
through. Now, what do I do?” 
“It’s all fixed,” North said 
dryly. “I’ll get well clear, then 
I’ll put this on and make it 
look as if you two are battling. 
When you’ve had enough, you 
bash it with your sword.” 

THE STAINLESS STEEL KNIGHT 



“Fat lot of good that’s go- . 
ing to do !” 

“I told you, it’s all fixed. 
Keep an eye out for a yellow 
danger-plate. It’s marked 
‘DRIVE - UNIT SAFETY 
COVER.' Just hit that. That’s 
all.” 

The Shogleet broke into a 
gentle canter. Lancelot drew 
his sword. The long, gleaming 
machine suddenly broke into 
loud and grumbling life, its 
great jaws agape. With a 
growl of gears, it moved and 
swung its great head round, 
like a humped serpent seeking 
prey. Then the headlight lit 
up, sending out a bright beam. 

“You know,” Lancelot jerk- 
ed, as the Shogleet swerved 
to chase the lumbering ma- 
chine, “this isn’t such a bad 
place, after all. I mean, once 
you get away from this armor- 
plated business. I think I’ll 
retire. I own all Sir Brian’s 
lands now. I could settle down, 
take life easy — ” 

“But you are a Prime G- 
man, Lancelot. It is your duty 
to return to Headquarter’s 
and report the successful com- 
pletion of your mission.” 

“North will take care of 
that for me.” 

“But you don’t really belong 
here.” 

“What’s that got to do with 
it? It’s a free country, isn’t 
it?” Lancelot waved his sword 
valiantly, and the Shogleet 
swerved suddenly, so that the 
tip of the blade struck the 
yellow panel.

T HE bang was enough to 
impress even the Shogleet. 
It was very busy, for a few 
fractionated seconds, warding 
off blast, radiation and chunks 
of flying debris. Then there 
was a ringing silence. In a 
thick haze of settling dust, it 
turned, scrambled up out of 
the hole and crept over the 
torn and ruptured earth to 
where North was peering, 
open-mouthed, from a shelter- 
ing bankside. Of the Brythons 
there was nothing to be seen 
but the puffs of dust from 
their flying heels. 

“You look all right,” North 
gasped, “but what about him?” 
“He is stunned, and in tem- 
porary fugue. It will pass. If 
you would hang the mentrol 
on my saddle, we will be leav- 
ing. You can clear up the odd 
details?” 

“Sure, I can handle those. 
You’re leaving right now?” 
“I think it would be wise. 



Lancelot seems to have formed 
one of those attachments, for 
a certain young lady. He in- 
tended to remain here per- 
manently. That would have 
been unwise, I understand?” 

“Dead right,” North grin- 
ned, but there were grim un- 
dertones. “With what he’s got, 
and you along, he would be 
‘Change’ in a big way. That 
wouldn’t do. I’d have to inter- 
fere. And that might be 
nasty.” 

“Yes, that is what I thought. 
It is better this way.” 

“Just what are you, any- 
way — a sort of guardian 
angel?” 

“You might say that, yes,” 
the Shogleet nodded, and set 
off to gallop the long trail, 
back to the ship. 

But it was still curious. It 
wondered just what Director 
Hugard would say when Lan- 
celot got back.

A fter w a t c h i n g the 
stranger drag Rosie Ash- 
win the length of Main Street, 
screaming her head off, Bill 
Garland, the town’s Law En- 
forcement Officer, turned to 
his cronies and said : “Did you 
see that? I don’t mind telling 
you, it was all I could do to 
stop myself going right out 
there in the street and telling 
the stranger to let Rosie 
alone!”

“He doesn’t mean any 
harm,” said Taft Barker un- 
easily. There were still a lot 
of people in Winsafton who 
preferred to ascribe anything 
the stranger did to mere ex- 
uberance. 

“Sooner or later, Bill Gar- 
land,” said Sam Basch, who 
didn’t, “you’re going to have 
to do something about that 
guy. You’re the LEO.” 

Garland pretended not to 
hear that. 

The stranger had Winsaf- 
ton pretty near the end of its 
tether. Gradually he had 
taken complete control of the 
town. Now he seemed to spend 
most of his time thinking up 
new, more capricious, more 
outrageous ways of exercis- 
ing his power. 

The stranger had a perfect- 
ly good name, Ed Ramsay, 
but nobody in Winsafton ever 
used it except to his face. 
“Stranger” meant “colonist” 
these days. There were seldom 
enough colonists around for it 
to be necessary to specify the 
one you meant. 

Few colonists returned to 
Earth. When they did they 
usually came to some town 
where they had family ties, 
where cousins, uncles, aunts, 
nephews and nieces still lived. 
But the stranger apparently 
had no connections on Earth, 
certainly not in Winsafton. 
Every day a dozen people 
asked resentfully: “What did 
he have to come here for, any- 
way?” It must have been a 

OOORMAT WORLD 



rhetorical question. There was 
never any answer. 

At first he merely pushed 
people around the way re- 
turned colonists always did. 
When he began to realize just 
how push-aroundable the peo- 
ple of Winsafton were, how- 
ever, he began to make his 
early behavior look like old- 
fashioned gallantry. 

He picked on the best house 
in Winsafton, the Goodman 
place, and just moved in. Well, 
what could the Goodmans do? 
They could hardly throw him 
out bodily. They just had to 
put up with him. And at first 
everybody but the Goodmans 
snickered and said it served 
the Goodmans right for hav- 
ing the showiest plaee in 
town. 

People snickered even more 
when it became known, as 
such tilings always become 
known in nothing flat, that 
the stranger had pulled Sally 
Goodman into his bedroom one 
night and kept the door lock- 
ed until next morning. 

There was no jealous lover 
to get mad about it. Sally was 
well on in her thirties and 
hadn’t been pretty even at 
eighteen. It seemed a good 
joke on the Goodmans that the 
stranger had not only elected 
to use their house as his own 
but also regarded their daugh- 
ter as part of the furnishings. 

T HEY stopped snickering 
when the stranger casually 
tossed Sally aside and started 

69 




helping himself to any pretty 
women who caught his eye. 
And to anything else he fan- 
cied. After all, you never knew 
it wouldn’t be your own wife 
next. Or it might even be your 
car or your house. 

It was Hank Hawk’s new 
Chrysler that the stranger 
eventually took, only two 
hours after dragging Rosie 
Ashwin into his lair at the 
Goodman place and slamming 
the door. Hawk’s complaints 
to the Law Enforcement Offi- 
cer were bitter. 

“Well, we don’t want to go 
off half-cocked about this, 
Hank,” said the LEO cau- 
tiously. “Maybe he’s only bor- 
rowed your car.” 

“I didn't say he could bor- 
row it. He stole it.” 

“Now, you can’t go around 
saying things like that. Hank, 
even about a stranger. He nev- 
er even spoke to you, did he? 
So maybe he thought you 
wouldn’t mind.” 

“I want my car back !” said 
Hank obstinately. 

“Then why don’t you just 
take it back?” 

,“How can I do that? The 
stranger knocked Bob Good- 
man all the way downstairs 
once, when he’d ordered fried 
chicken for dinner and got 
steak instead. I doift want to 
take any chances. I don’t see 
why I should. You’re the Law 
Enforcement Officer, not me.” 
“Sure, Hank,” said Garland 
soothingly, “but I can’t do a 
thing until I know a law’s 

70 



been broken. As of now, all I 
know is, the stranger borrow- 
ed your Chrysler. That ain’t 
against the law.” 

“I want my car back !” Hank 

Qrrpamprf 

“Then take it back, Hank.” 
“You’re scared of the stran- 
ger,” Hank said bitterly. 

“Now, there’s no call to be 
abusive. Hank. Run along 
now, and come to me when 
you have a genuine complaint.” 
Hank raised his fists to 
heaven in frustration. 

I N this way the LEO man- 
aged for a long time to do 
nothing whatever about the 
stranger and his actions. How- 
ever, as time went on, Gar- 
•and became uneasily conscious 
that sooner or later he might 
be forced to speak severely to 
the stranger. This he was re- 
luctant to do. The stranger 
was all too liable to spit to- 
bacco juice at him. It wasn’t 
good for a LEO’s prestige and 
authority to have tobacco juice 
spat at him. 

Yet more and more people 
were starting to talk like 
Hank Hawk. There was, for 
example, the storekeeper who 
said the stranger now owed 
$3,216.58 and had shown nei- 
ther inclination nor ability to 
pay a cent. There was Wesley 
Coleman, who bumped into the 
stranger as Coleman emerged 
from his own front gate. The 
stranger immediately threw 
stones at Coleman’s house, 
breaking every single front 

j. t. McIntosh 




window. There was the truck 
driver who was unable to pre- 
vent the stranger denting 
Hank Hawk's Chrysler against 
his truck. The stranger not 
only knocked the truck driver 
down, he found a can of yel- 
low paint on the truck, tore 
the truck driver’s pants to 
ribbons and poured the paint 
on his naked belly. Everybody 
agreed that this was rude. 

As Law Enforcement Offi- 
cer, Garland was sheriff, po- 
lice chief, police force, district 
attorney and public prosecu- 
tor rolled into one. There was 
no one to whom to pass the 
buck. If anybody did anything 
about the stranger, it would 
have to be the LEO. 

Garland was so concerned 
over this that he seriously 
considered emigrating. He got 
as far as reading pamphlets 
about sixteen of the forty- 
three available colonies. Then 
he realized something he should 
have seen at once. On any one 
of those forty-three pioneer 
worlds the entire population 
would consist of people like 
the stranger. 

He dismissed the possibility 
of emigrating from his mind. 
There remained, of course, 
suicide . 

The trouble was, the stran- 
ger got worse every day. 
Although he didn’t appear to 
give a damn for anybody or 
anything, the pattern of his 
behavior showed clearly 
enough that from the moment 
he arrived in Winsafton he 



had been trying things to see 
if he’d get away with them. 
When he did, he’d try some- 
thing a little more extreme. 

At first when he took things 
on credit there had been at 
least a pretense that he was 
going to pay eventually. Later 
he bullied people into saying 
they’d presented the things to 
him as gifts. Eventually he 
simply took what he wanted 
without explanation or prom- 
ise. 

His caveman tactics witr 
women, too, started quietly 
with Sally Goodman, extended 
to young, unmarried girls who 
were far too timid to describe 
publicly and in detail exactly 
what had happened to them 
and complain about it, and 
gradually spread to any fe- 
male the stranger happened 
to fancy. 

T IE limit was reached when 
the stranger arrived at a 
wedding and carried off the 
bride, pretty little Lucy Smith, 
the instant she became Lucy 
Jaffray. It was no good talk- 
ing about droit de seigneur 
to citizens of Winsafton. This, 
they felt, was going too far. 

Unable to stall any more, 
Garland organized a posse of 
all the men who had least 
reason to love the stranger 
— Lucy’s father Tom Smith, 
Harry Jaffray, Hank Hawk, 
the truck driver, the store- 
keeper, Wesley Coleman, half 
a dozen others. They called at 
the Goodman place. 



DOORMAT WORLD

The stranger came out to 
stand on the porch and look 
at them. 

He was a big man, but no 
bigger than Garland or the 
truck driver. A stronger sun 
than Sol had burned his face 
so brown it was almost pur- 
ple. He was untidily dressed 
in an off-the-peg suit he had 
taken from the local tailor — 
without, of course, paying for 
it — and there was egg on his 
chin. 

“Well?” he said, grinning 
wolfishly at them. His act 
could be as corny as he liked. 
Nobody was going to laugh 
at him. 

Garland cleared his throat. 
“Mr. Ramsay,” he said, “Win- 
safton is a peaceable little 
town. In my ten years as Law 
Enforcement Officer, all I’ve 
ever had to deal with, except 
for the Saturday night drunks, 
has been one case of justifiable 
homicide and three of theft. 
We’re proud of this record, 
and—” 

“Why was the homicide jus- 
tifiable?” the stranger asked, 
suddenly interested. 

“Husband shot a man who 
assaulted his wife. You rea- 
lize, Mr. Ramsay, that if any 
one of six or seven men shot 
you dead, they’d go free.” 

“Six or seven!” the stran- 
ger roared suddenly, affront- 
ed. “Hell, I been here a month ! 
It must be at least thirty.” 

As he yelled at them, the 
whole posse took an involun- 
tary step backwards. The 

72 



stranger took a step forward. 
“Say, if anybody has any com- 
plaint against Ed Ramsay, 
he’s come to the right place. 
Let’s hear what you’ve all got 
to say.” 

He stepped down from the 
porch. The group hurriedly 
rearranged itself, everybody 
trying to get as far away from 
the stranger as possible. Cole- 
man was unlucky. He bumped 
into the truck-driver and 
couldn’t get any further back. 

“You,” said the stranger, 
standing so close to Coleman 
that their breaths mingled. 
“Have you got something 
against me?” 

Coleman took a deep breath. 
His voice came out in a high 
whine. “You broke all my 
windows !” 

“Well, it’s summer, ain’t it?” 

“Yes, but—” 

“You want plenty of fresh 
air, don’t you?” 

“Yes, but — " 

“Want me to sue you for 
deliberately running into me 
and trying to knock me down?” 

“I didn’t deliberately — ” 

“I say you did. And no- 
body’s going to disagree with 
me.” 

Coleman gulped and made 
no answer. 

“Would you like to with- 
draw your complaint?” the 
stranger asked, clenching his 
large, knotted right hand and 
brandishing it under Cole- 
man’s nose. 

“I would,” said Coleman 
hastily. “Very much.” 

j. t. McIntosh 




“Okay,” said the stranger. 
“Your apology’s accepted. Get 
the hell out of here.” 

Coleman scuttled off, his 
ears red, not looking back. 

N EXT the stranger stepped 
up to the truck-driver. 
“Have you something you 
want to say?” 

“I’ve still got patches of 
yellow paint on my stomach !” 
said the truck-driver indig- 
nantly. 

“What do you want, the 
second coat?” 

“No, I . No, I . I just 
wanted to tell you . .” 
“You’ve told me.” 

The truck-driver made off 
rapidly after Coleman. 

Garland saw what was hap- 
pening but was powerless to 
prevent it. The posse had felt 
strong and resolute when there 
were more than a dozen of 
them. Now as men left, one 
after another, those who re- 
mained became more and more 
uneasy and less willing to 
stand up to Ramsay. 

"You. Who are you?” the 
stranger demanded. 

“I’m Harry Jaffray. It was 
my wife you — ” 

The stranger ehuckled.“Sure 
boy, I know what you want 
to know. Very natural.” He 
winked, slapped Jaffray’s 
shoulder, whispered into his 
ear and pushed him away. 

Curiously enough, it was 
Sam Basch, who had never 
had any direct cause to hate 
Ramsay, who stood up to him. 

DOORMAT WORLD 



“We don’t like you,” he said 
bluntly. “Go away.” 

“You want me to push your 
nose out of the back of your 
head, maybe?” 

“No. That wouldn’t make 
me like you any better.” 

The stranger looked Sam 
Basch over. Once Sam had 
been a very powerful man, 
but Sam was sixty-one now. 
He was beginning to stoop a 
little and he limped slightly. 

“Old man,” said the stran- 
ger, “you know what’ll hap- 
pen when I hit you ?” 

“No,” Sam admitted. 

“You do now,” said the 
stranger, and shot out his fist 
like a piston. Sam Basch took 
it right on the belly-button, 
and shut up like a jackknife. 

That was the end of the 
discussion. The three who re- 
mained picked Sam up, dusted 
him off, and wouldn’t let him 
go after the stranger, who had 
disappeared into the house. 

"If I was only thirty -years 
younger . .” Sam gasped, 
holding his middle. 

“But you’re not,” said Gar- 
land regretfully. For a mo- 
ment of wild hope he had 
thought he was going to be 
able to pass the buck to Sam 
Basch (who, he now remem- 
bered, had nearly emigrated 
once). But Sam was too old. 
And the stranger was too 
tough. 

No, there was nothing for 
it now but to keep out of the 
stranger’s way and not catch 
him at anything. So long as 

73 




the LEO did that, he could 
pretend that Ramsay hadn’t 
done anything. 

W HEN the second colonist 
arrived in Winsafton, the 
town for a few hours was 
close to panic. 

It was very rare indeed for 
colonists to visit Earth. The 
emigration regulations were 
strict and unequivocal. Any- 
body who wanted to emigrate 
was told bluntly that he could 
either go or stay, but he had to 
make up his mind one way or 
the other once for all time. 
And in all the colonies there 
was so much to do, and so 
much more opportunity than 
there had been on Earth for 
centuries, that few people had 
any time to be homesick and 
bemoan the fact that the emi- 
gration authorities wouldn’t 
let them go back to Earth. 

Inter-galactic travel was so 
expensive and demanded so 
much organization that no in- 
dividual could actually pay for 
his passage, any more than 
any one person could pay for 
a country’s national defense 
Consequently individuals did 
not decide for themselves that 
they’d leave Earth for the col- 
onies or return from a colony 
to Earth. They submitted 
their cases to a board which 
considered each case on its 
merits. 

Since Earth was still the 
leading manufacturing planet 
Earth made most of the gal- 
axy’s spaceships. They left 

74 



Earth crammed with emi- 
grants, and not one of them 
in ten ever returned. They 
were used thereafter for inter- 
galactic trade, not for ferrying 
back malcontents to Earth. 

The case of the stranger in 
Winsafton was therefore un- 
usual; and the arrival of a 
second colonist in the same 
small town at the same time 
was even more unusual. 

The people of Winsafton 
weren’t worried for long, how- 
ever. It soon got around that 
the newcomer was Jim Arlen, 
Hugh Arlen’s youngest boy, 
who had been born and 
brought up in Winsafton. 

That made all the differ- 
ence, of course. Everybody 
remembered Jim Arlen, a 
tough but likeable youngster 
who had been chased out of 
every fruit orchard in the dis- 
trict at one time or other. 

“Let’s see,” people said, 
scratching their heads, “young 
Jim must be — why, he must 
be thirty-five now.” 

“All of that,” others agreed. 
“Time flies, doesn’t it?” 

It was Sam Basch, not Bill 
Garland, who went to see Jim 
Arlen at the town’s one hotel. 

“Hi, Jim,” he said. “Re- 
member me? I shot you full 
of buckshot once.” 

“Nobody ever shot me full 
of buckshot,” Jim replied. “If 
you shot at me, you missed.” 
Basch sighed. “I never was 
much of a shot. Pity. There’s 
somebody in town who needs 
shooting right now.” 

j. t. McIntosh 




“You mean Ed Ramsny?” 
Jim grinned. “I’ve heard 
about him.” 

Sam Basch wanted to know 
one thing before he talked to 
Jim Arlen about Ramsay. 
“Why’d you come back, Jim?” 

Jim was as big as Ed Ram- 
say, a little younger and not 
so heavily tanned. He still had 
the easy grin Sam remem- 
bered. 

“It seems my father still 
owns a big plot of land north- 
east of town,” Jim said. “We 
never gave it much thought 
when we emigrated. We tried 
to sell it, but nobody would 
buy. Now it seems there’s 
some trouble over this land. 
The board on Zukeen sent me 
back to straighten out the 
mess and report on some new 
agricultural equipment while 
I’m here.” 

Basch nodded. “So you’ll be 
going back soon?” 

“In a couple of months, I 
reckon.” 

“You've heard about Ram- 
say? You know him, maybe?” 

“Hell, no. He comes from 
Benvice and I’m from Zukeen. 
Never met anybody from Ben- 
vice. Don’t know much about 
the place.” 

“The fact is, Jim, Ramsay’s 
been terrorizing the town.” 

“I’ve heard that. I don’t see 
how.” 

S AM explained. As he did 
so, Jim’s smile became a 
puzzled frown. 

“I don’t get it,” he said at 

DOORMAT WORLD 



last. “You mean he did all this 
and nobody stopped him?” 
“Nobody tried to ’cept me. 
He gave me a poke in the guts 
and that was that.” 

“I still don’t get it. He’s 
just one man. How can one 
man have a whole town lick- 
ing his boots?” 

“You were pretty young 
when you left here, Jim. You 
weren’t old enough to look 
around you and do any think- 
ing. Don’t you know Earth’s 
been sending out colonists for 
hundreds of years?” 

“Sure, but what’s that got 
to do with it?” 

“You were a pretty tough 
family, Jim, you and your 
folks and your brother. I 
bailed your father out of jail 
two or three times, and as for 
your mother . well. We 
won’t go into that. Point is, 
you were all pretty hard to 
handle. Tell me, Jim, are you 
known as a tough family on 
Zukeen?” 

Jim grinned. “Hell, no. 
Solid citizens, the Arlens. 
Hardly ever in jail, any of us. 
The old man’s a counselor. 
Even my brother hasn’t been 
in any trouble since he shot 
his father-in-law, and that 
was five years ago.” 

“Well, Jim, Earth isn’t like 
the colonies. For centuries 
anybody with any courage, 
determination or imagination 
has emigrated. It’s still pos- 
sible to make a fortune in the 
colonies. It hasn't been pos- 
sible here on Earth since the 

75 




early twentieth century. Nat- 
urally anybody with any initi- 
ative emigrates. And this has 
been going on for hundreds 
of years.” 

Jiln nodded slowly. “I’m be- 
ginning to see what you’re 
getting at.” 

“Natural selection, Jim. 
People without courage, de- 
termination, imagination and 
initiative tend to beget chil- 
dren without courage, deter- 
mination, imagination and 
initiative. ’Course, they don’t 
always succeed. Even now, a 
lot of fellows like you are 
growing up here on Earth. 
That’s why the flow of emi- 
grants to the colonies never 
dries up. See?” 

“Yes, I guess I do.” 

“Earth’s a doormat world, 
Jim. People here ask to be 
stepped on. Mind, I don’t say 
they like it. But if you apolo- 
gize every time somebody 
wipes his feet on you, it’s not 
surprising if you get stepped 
on a lot. Still, we get on all 
right when there aren’t any 
colonists around. It’s only 
when men like Ed Ramsay are 
here that people get stepped 
on. What can you expect, 
when there’s nobody in Win- 
safton with enough guts to 
say boo to a goose?” 

“I seem to remember that 
you were always ready to say 
boo to a goose.” 

"Maybe, Jim, but do you 
remember something else? I 
always wanted to emigrate. 
Only my wife wouldn’t go.” 

76 



Jim nodded. “I remember.” 
“Well, look, Jim. You were 
born here. But you’re a colon- 
ist. You’re not scared of Ed 
Ramsay. You can get rid of 
him. Do that for us, and we’ll 
be grateful.” 

Jim grinned but shook his 
head. “Hell, Sam, Ramsay’s 
nothing to me. He never did 
me any harm.” 

“Wait around,” said Sam 
meaningly. "I guess it won't 
be long before you change 
your mind.” 

S AM was wrong. A month 
passed and there was no 
clash between Ed Ramsay and 
Jim Arlen. Whether by chance 
or by design, Ramsay avoided 
antagonizing Jim in any way. 
Although he didn’t stop tak- 
ing anything he wanted, from 
whisky to women, Ramsay did 
nothing new during this peri- 
od. He didn’t seek Jim’s com- 
pany either. When the two 
colonists met in the street they 
merely nodded to each other 
and passed on. 

Meanwhile Jim Arlen was 
finding out for himself how it 
had been possible for Ed Ram- 
say to subjugate the whole 
town so that whenever he ap- 
peared, doors and windows 
slammed, loungers scuttled off 
down side streets and women 
ran like startled does. 

Resistance had been bred 
out of Terrans. They weren’t 
scared of each other, and con- 
sequently when no colonists 
were around they acted like 

j. t. McIntosh 




any human society anywhere. 

But when somebody who 
did have a strong will said: 
“Do this,” everybody in Win- 
safton — except Sam Basch — 
meekly did as he was told. 

Out in the square on a 
hot day, Jim experimentally 
handed his coat to a man he’d 
never seen before. “Take that 
to the hotel, please,” he said 
firmly. 

The other didn’t say a word. 
He simply took the coat to the 
hotel. 

Gradually Jim began to 
understand the situation, and 
realize what was happening 
to Ed Ramsay. All power cor- 
rupts, someone had said, and 
absolute power corrupts abso- 
lutely. If it wasn’t absolute 
power that any colonist 
wielded in Winsafton, it was 
something very dose to it. 

Seeing Wesley Coleman one 
day with an expensive cigar- 
ette case, Jim tried another 
experiment. 

“That’s a nice case,” he said 
casually 

“You like it?” said Coleman 
guardedly. 

“Sure do. Let me look at it, 
will you?” 

Silently Coleman handed 
the case to him. 

“I sure would like a case 
like this,” Jim said. 

He knew perfectly well that 
if he took it, Coleman would 
say nothing. He also knew 
that if he told Coleman to give 
it to him, Coleman would do 
so. What he wondered was if 



Coleman could be made appar- 
ently voluntarily to offer him 
the case. 

Coleman could. It took a 
while, and Jim had to admire 
the case very pointedly before 
Coleman said reluctantly that 
he could have it if he liked. 
Satisfied, Jim shook his head 
and handed it back, to Cole- 
man’s obvious relief. 

That was power. If you had 
to break the law to get what 
you wanted, you might find 
yourself in real trouble even- 
tually, even when the law was 
represented only by a spine- 
less figurehead like Bill Gar- 
land. Among people like this, 
however, you didn’t even have 
to break the law. You did 
what you liked and then made 
anybody else concerned say 
you had their full permission. 

Ramsay was still using 
Hank Hawk’s Chrysler, and 
Hank was still complaining 
about it to Garland. But every-- 
body knew, including Garland 
and Hank, that if the L.E.O. 
ever brought himself to the 
point of charging Ramsay 
with theft, Ramsay would 
make Hank say he’d lent him 
the Chrysler. Or even that he’d 
given it to him. 

Almost involuntarily, Jim 
found himself ordering people 
about. After all, when he was 
sitting down comfortably and 
suddenly wanted something, 
why should he go for it when 
there were others around? 
When he wanted to go out of 
town and look round the prop- 



DOORMAT WORLD 



77 




erty his father owned, why 
shouldn’t he tell somebody to 
drive him out and show him? 

He knew that Ramsay was 
simply waiting for him to 
leave before turning the screw 
still harder on the citizens of 
Winsafton. He knew also that 
Sam Basch hadn’t been the 
only one who had hoped that 
Jim Arlen would fix Ed Ram- 
say for them. But now, after 
a month, they were getting 
worried. If Ramsay could 
avoid a clash with Jim Arlen 
for a month, couldn't he go 
on doing it for another month? 
Would Jim Arlen go away 
from Winsafton, his business 
completed, leaving Ed Ram- 
say to extend his power until 
the whole town literally 
crawled at his feet? 

There had been efforts to 
make Jim stay longer, but he 
had pointed out that the only 
ship from Earth to Zukeen in 
the next two years left on 
August 7. 

He was sorry for the Win- 
snftonians and from what he’d 
heard of him he didn’t think 
much of Ed Ramsay. How- 
ever, in the colonies your own 
business took all your time 
and effort, and you got out of 
the habit of meddling in other 
people’s. 

If Ed Ramsay tangled with 
him, okay, he and Ramsay 
would settle the business be- 
tween them. If Ramsay didn’t 
tangle with him, Jim Arlen 
h^d no intention of interfer- 
ing. 



W ALKING one day in the 
square — which was oval 
— Jim Arlen became aware of 
something different, without 
knowing what it was. It took 
him a couple of minutes to 
realize that the statue in the 
center of the grass patch was 
missing. It was no great loss. 
The statue had been of some 
gloomy, long - faced pioneer 
who had lived long before 
space travel. 

Turning from the empty 
plinth Jim saw Lucy Jaffray, 
who was undoubtedly the pret- 
tiest girl in town. Another ex- 
periment instantly suggested 
itself to him. 

“Lucy!” he called. 

She started, and seemed 
only moderately relieved to 
find that it was Jim Arlen and 
not Ed Ramsay who had 
shouted. She came submissive- 
ly enough. 

“Look, the statue’s gone,” 
Jim said. 

She nodded. “It’s being 
cleaned,” she said guardedly. 

“I think you’d make a lovely 
statue, Lucy.” 

“Me?” 

“Yes, you, Lucy.” He put 
his hands on her waist and 
lifted her to stand on the 
empty plinth. 

“Please let me come down,” 
she begged, blushingly. Al- 
ready a hundred spectators 
had gathered. 

Jim looked up at her ad- 
miringly. She certainly made 
a very attractive statue. 
“Statues don’t wear clothes,” 



78 



j. t. McIntosh 




he said. “Anyway, girl statues 
don’t. If you’re going to be a 
statue, I guess you’ll have to 
take yOur clothes off, Lucy.” 
“But I don’t want to be a 
statue !” 

“You can’t help it, Lucy. 
You’re pretty enough to be a 
statue, and we can’t leave the 
plinth empty, can we? Take 
your clothes off, Lucy.” 
Blushing still more violent- 
ly she unzipped her dress and 
dropped it to the ground. 

“Now when did you see a 
statue wearing a girdle?” said 
Jim. “It isn’t right, Lucy. It 
isn’t right at all.” 

Slowly and reluctantly she 
took off her underclothes, 
stockings and shoes and 
crouched on the plinth, cover- 
ing herself with her arms. 

“Really, Lucy, you don’t 
seem to have the idea at all. 
I don’t think you’ve ever seen 
a statue. Stand straight up — 
that’s better.” 

The crowd was huge now. 
It stayed at a respectful dis- 
tance, however, and nobody 
snickered or said anything 
loud enough for Jim Arlen to 
hear. 

Poor Lucy went white, then 
red, then white again. It 
seemed to her as if all the eyes 
in the world were fixed on her. 

“Okay,” said Jim at last, 
“you can come down now.” 
“Stay where you are,” said 
a voice behind them. 

Ramsay was looking at the 
naked girl with frank lust in 
his eyes. “I must have been 



crazy,” he said, “taking you 
home only once.” 

“I said you could come 
down, Lucy,” Jim said. 

“And I said stay where you 
are,” said Ramsay. 

Jim lifted the girl down, ig- 
noring Ramsay. Ramsay spat 
tobacco juice and bellowed like 
a bull. Jim turned, and in an 
instant Winsafton had what it 
wanted — a fight between the 
two colonists. 

L UCY picked up her things 
and ran. Nobody else went, 
however. 

It was a fight the like of 
which hadn’t been seen on 
Earth for centuries. Such a 
fight would have been impos- 
sible between two Earthmen, 
or between a colonist and an 
Earthman. Both fighters were 
down at least a dozen times, 
and no Earthman would have 
kept getting up. 

The winner of any tough, 
even scrap is not so much the 
man who can take more as the 
man who does take more. Be- 
fore half the population of 
Winsafton, neither contestant 
was prepared to be beaten. 
Both knew that the loser 
would be finished in the town. 

Ramsay’s nose was bleed- 
ing copiously, making him 
look much more badly hurt 
than he was. Jim Arlen’s left 
eye was closing rapidly and 
his shirt was torn half off. 

For the tenth time Ramsay 
rushed at Jim and both men 
rolled on the ground. Both 



79 



DOORMAT WORLD 




rose and Ramsay went down. 
Ramsay leapt to his feet and 
Jim went down. Now one of 
Ramsay’s eyes was cut and 
Jim spat out a tooth. 

For a long time there was 
nothing in it. Then Ramsay 
went down three times in a 
row. He was slower each time 
he got up. And the crowd 
watched him realize that al- 
though he could still take a 
lot more, he couldn’t take 
enough. 

The fourth time he went 
down in a row he stayed down. 
Perhaps he could have made 
another try. The fact was that 
he didn’t. 

“I don’t want to see you in 
town again, Ramsay,” Jim 
said. 

“You won’t,” Ramsay mut- 
tered. 

They had both forgotten the 
crowd, since everybody had 
kept a very respectful dis- 
tance away. But at this every 
citizen of Winsafton let out 
such a yell of delight that 
Ramsay, still on the ground, 
jerked convulsively. 

In a moment Jim was sur- 
rounded by hundreds of people 
who wanted to shake him by 
the hand. In the intoxicating 
joy of the moment, Wesley 
Coleman accidentally trod on 
Ramsay’s face. 

They heard later that Ram- 
say went back to Benvice. 

Jim Arlen was feted for 
days. He was a public hero. 
No one who saw that fight 
ever forgot it. What amazed 

80 



the spectators was the dogged 
courage of men who could be 
knocked down time after time 
and come back for more. In 
the exceedingly rare physical 
arguments which still took 
place on Earth, it was always 
taken for granted that if a 
man hit the ground, that was 
the end of the fight. Often the 
first blow was the last. 

Curiously enough, it was 
less than a week before Win- 
safton’s attitude changed dra- 
matically. The start of the 
change was when Jim made 
Wesley Coleman give him his 
cigarette case. Then Jim bor- 
rowed Hank Hawk’s Chrysler, 
which Hank had had for four 
days altogether. Then, sines 
it was obviously the most com- 
fortable house in town, Jim 
moved in with the Goodmans. - 
And finally Jim Arlen, not sq^ 
polygamous as Ramsay, took 
Lucy Jaffray in to live with 
him. 

He was not unaware, him- 
self, of what had happened. 
.4/1 power corrupts, he told 
himself ruefully, pulling Lucy 
to him, and absolute power 
corrupts absolutely. 

Winsafter relied desperately 
on one thing — Jim Arlen’s 
spaceship blasted off on Au- 
gust 7. 

With the warmth of Lucy 
against him, Jim was wonder- 
ing vaguely if it might not be 
possible to miss his ship. 

He decided it wouldn’t mere- 
ly be possible. It would be 
easy. END

THE BEM CALLED 

WINDIGO 



What do you do 
when you KNOW 
you're insane? 



44C O she ordered her b^oth- 

O er-in-law to strait-jack- 
et her, stun her with an axe 
and then set fire to her tent. 
While this was done, her hus- 
band and children looked on, 
for she had an undisputed 
right to dispose of herself as 
she chose.” 

So reads one of the high 
points — and they are many 
— in an extraordinary report 
recently published in the Pro- 
ceedings of the American Eth- 
nological Society, and written 
by Dr. Morton I. Teicher, a 
dean at Yeshiva University. 

Many years ago — 71, to be 
exact — one James George 
Frazer wrote down a similar 
brief anecdote (a suspenseful 
description of a priest in an 
olive grove, naked sword in 



hand, moving about among 
the shadows, sleeping in sec- 
l'et, brief snatches, watching, 
watching every waking sec- 
ond for the man who would 
murder him to take his place, 
as he had murdered and re- 
placed his predecessor. Ex- 
plaining who, where and es- 
pecially why this happened 
took Sir James a quarter of a 
century and twelve monu- 
mental volumes. The result 
was The Golden Bough. 

Such anecdotes, out of con- 
text, are provocative in the 
extreme, and this kind of pro- 
vocation is just what nudges 
the best science fiction out 
of the best science-fiction 
writers. 

What these two anecdotes 
have in common is the note of 



81 




social acceptance they carry, 
for in one the brother-in-law 
does the dirty work while the 
family looks on, and in the 
other the murderer/victim is 
a priest. 

B UT back to Dr. Teicher 
and his work. His special 
field is the Algonkian-speak- 
ing group of northeast Ameri- 
can Indians — the Cree, Ojib- 
wa, Beaver and others — and 
their strange and ancient 
monster, the windigo. 

There are few, if any, draw- 
ings or sculptures of the wind- 
igo, mainly because these peo- 
ple have never gone in for the 
graphic arts. But their myths 
are very specific. The windigo 
has (rather like the Abomin- 
able Snowman) yard-long feet 
with only one toe and long 
pointed heels. His eyes are 
bloody and bulging, and you 
can hear his hissing breath 
for miles. His lipless mouth, 
jagged teeth and terrible 
clawed hands are used to pack 
the monster full of swamp 
moss, rotten wood and mush- 
rooms, but only when he can’t 
get human flesh. 

Now, these Indians are not 
cannibals, and have a rather 
unusually strong taboo 
against the practice. Yet fre- 
quently — in 42 out of the 70 
cases here documented — can- 
nibalistic acts were com- 
mitted, usually against rela- 
tives or close friends. And in 
every one of the cases, which 
must be termed “insanity”, 

82 



the windigo was involved. Dr. 
Teicher calls them “windigo 
psychoses”, having used the 
windigo element in them to 
tie together a whole collection 
of case histories which range 
right across the clinical spec- 
trum, from mild neurosis to 
the most advanced psycho- 
pathological states. These In- 
dians are as familiar with the 
presence of the windigo, and 
its ability to cause such a 
variety of disorders, as we are 
with the presence of a virus- 
group which can cause every- 
thing from sniffles to epidemic 
influenza. They too have their 
therapies. One of these is the 
ceremonial murder of the in- 
fected person, even before he 
has committed a cannibalistic 
act. 

Which brings us to the case 
of the bound, axed, doomed 
woman in the burning tent, 
and the solemn husband and 
children who passively wit- 
nessed the scene. She had felt 
that she was becoming a win- 
digo. It got worse; it got so 
bad that the people around 
her began to look like beavers; 
she wanted to eat them. She 
therefore ordered her own 
death. 

This is undoubtedly insan- 
ity, but one must remark in 
passing that it startlingly 
lacks the “I’m all right” ra- 
tionalization of so many ma- 
jor psychoses. She knew she 
was insane. And isn’t that the 
traditional proof of sanity?

I N 2212, when Walt Onegh 
died, Arm Brewer, Direc- 
tor of Staff, recommended 
Tom Calloway to fill the emp- 
ty position as Director of 
Crews at Midwest Construc- 
tion. The board, of course, 
confirmed. 

One of Tom’s first acts was 
to drop by Arm’s office and 
thank him. 

“I’d hoped—” he said. 
“But not so soon.” 

Arm clapped his big hand 
on Tom’s shoulder. His crop- 
ped white hair aureoled his 
healthy pink face. 

“Not a moment too soon,” 
he said. “You’re management 
material, Tom. A man of prin- 
ciples is rare in this cutthroat 
world of ours.” 

“You overestimate me,” 
said Tom. But he glowed in- 
side. It was true he had hop- 
ed; but not quite as modestly 
as he implied to Arm. Fifty 
was not old these days. But 



neither was it younj*. And 
he would be fifty-one m three 
weeks. And with people knif- 
ing each other in the back for 
every little job or advan- 
tage. 

“Run along and take over 
your offices,” said Arm geni- 
ally. “You inherit from Walt, 
lock, stock and barrel. Suite 
312.” 

“Suite 312,” echoed Tom, sa 
voring it. For the three hun- 
dreds were third level. Exe- 
cutive. 

T HE meaning of lock, stock 
and barrel became more 
apparent when he actually 
stood in the outer room of his 
two-office suite, however. It 
obviously included Christine 
Nyall and the plant. 

It was the plant which, of 
the two, struck him more 
strongly at first glance. 
Among the silver and opale- 
scences, the businesslike glit- 
ter of the office, it stood out 
like a drab of nature, its

thick, shiny green leaves 
spread out flatly above the 
crystal pot. 

“Why, what is it?” Tom 
asked, forcing a smile. 

“A sort of rubber plant,” 
Christine Nyall replied. She 
ducked her head above her 
stenomachine, then added, 
with almost a touch of defi- 
ance, “Mr. Onegh liked a 
touch of green about the 
place.” 

She did not meet his eye 
when speaking. It was this 
more than anything else that 
disturbed Tom, who had tak-. 
en pride all his life in meet- 
ing everyone with a level gaze 
and a clear conscience. It was 
painfully obvious to him at 
this moment that Christine 
■was being turtle-cautious. 
That was what came from be- 
ing formerly Walt’s secretary, 
and thus now a holdover. 

The plain fact of the mat- 
ter was that there was now 
no job for her, with Walt 
dead. In the glutted labor 
market of overpopulated 
Earth, there was not any 
other position available for 
her within the company — un- 
less Tom made one. And Tom 
did not. His own secretary, 
Bera Karlson, had been with 
him twenty years. He had no 
intention of replacing her 
with this old woman. On the 
other hand, by virtue of her 
age and length of service, 
Christine was Class A Secre- 
tarial. She had tenure. She 
could not be discharged short 

84 



of the legal retirement age. 

It was an uncomfortable 
situation, with its only possi- 
ble solution lying in Chris- 
tine’s voluntary retirement. 
And it was clear she had no 
present intention of that. 

“Um,” said Tom, stepping 
over to the plant. He looked 
down at it. It was not a pret- 
ty thing, he thought; and on 
one broad and fleshy leaf a 
small spot showed whitely. 

“It seems to have a touch 
of blight,” he said; 

“Oh no,” said Christine, 
swiftly. “That’s just a little 
bald spot.” 

“I see,” said Tom. He turn- 
ed away and went on into the 
private office to examine that 
which would be his. 

A fterwards, he took 

the problem of Christine 
home with him. It was still 
obsessing him after dinner, 
when he woke to the realiza- 
tion that his wife had been 
speaking to him and he had 
not been listening at all. 

“What?” he asked. And 
looked at her contritely. “Sor- 
ry, Josi. I had my mind on 
the office.” 

She smiled at him forgiv- 
ingly, this slim, amazingly 
youthful woman to whom he 
had been married for the last 
nineteen years. He had mar- 
ried late and, as he firmly be- 
lieved, for love. And all that 
had come out of his marriage, 
including his two young sons 
— one fifteen and one eleven 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




— had made him idyllically 
happy. 

“What’s bothering you?” 
she asked. 

“No,” he said. “Tell me 
what you were talking about, 
instead.” She shook her head. 

“I'll save it,” she said. “You 
first.” 

He stretched and straight- 
ened up on his couch, look- 
ing across to where she sat 
half-curled upon an overstuff- 
ed hassock, brown against the 
white of it, her long limbs 
and the slight angularity of 
her body softened by the 
lounging pajamas tightbelted 
around her slim waist. 

“It’s Christine Nyall,” he 
said. “She’s not retiring.” 

“Oh?” said Josi. “But that 
doesn’t affect you, does it?” 

“I’m afraid so.” He gri- 
maced slightly. “She’s a hold- 
over. And with no place to go 
she’ll be staying in my outer 
office. You see — ” He ex- 
plained the holdover system, 
and tenure. 

“But can’t you make her 
do her sitting around some- 
place else?” asked Josi. 

“Not without risking a writ 
of prejudice and a work fine, 
if a court convicts me,” he 
said unhappily. “The tenure 
law reads she must be kept 
‘on the job’. And the job is 
that of being secretary to the 
Director of Crews.” 

“Oh,” said Josi. There was 
silence. Finally he broke it by 
asking what had been on her 
mind. 



“I shouldn’t bother you 
with it now,” she said. 

“Nonsense. I shouldn’t 
bring the office home with 
me, anyway. Go ahead.” 

“ — Can’t you talk her into 
retiring?” 

Tom sighed. 

“The only thing I can do is 
make life in the office a liv- 
ing hell for her,” he said. 
“I’ve known it done before 
by other men with the same 
problem. Only I’m just not 
built to do something like 
that.” 

“No,” she answered, look- 
ing at him. 

“No.” He looked down at 
his hand, which had closed 
itself into a fist. He opened 
it, wiggled the fingers, then 
looked again at Josi. 

“We’ll forget it,” he said. 

“Now, what was it you 
wanted to talk about?” 

S HE got up from the has- 
sock and came over to sit 
down beside him. He looked 
curiously at her. 

“Something important?” 
he asked. 

“Yes. Tom — ” 

“What?* 

“You’re class A manage- 
ment now,” she said. “You’ve 
got tenure. You don’t have 
to work any more. We don’t 
need to go on living close to 
the Company Offices.” 

“No — ” He still looked at 
her, slightly puzzled. “But 
what about it? Where would 
you want to live?” 



A TASTE OF TENURE 



85 




“Away from the city.” 

He looked at her in aston- 
ishment, convinced that she 
must be joking. But her face 
was unsmiling. 

“But there is no away from 
the city,” he said. “Not now- 
adays. You know that, Josi. 
There’s no unimproved land 
left anywhere in the world.” 
“There’s the Preserves,” 
she said. 

“The Preserves!” He blink- 
ed. “But you can't live in 
them. They’re parks. De- 
liberately restricted — you 
know that — by the govern- 
ment, so we’ll have a few 
scraps of open country to 
look at and remember the 
past.” 

“Oh yes,” she said. “But 
they have tourist lodges.” 

He smiled with sudden un- 
derstanding. He reached out 
for her hands. Josi let him 
take them, but they lay limp 
and quiet in his grasp. 

“Honey,” he said. “I hate 
to disappoint you, but these 
cabins and things might as 
well be on Pluto as far as you 
and I are concerned. I know 
it looks like you can live 
around the Preserves. But 
you can’t. Those tourist quar- 
ters have all been bought up 
years in advance by the big 
travel agencies. To get them 
you’d have to sign up for 
what they call perpetual tours 
— all-expense luxury set-ups. 
And the prices are fantastic. 
Why, for you and me and the 
boys, just the four of us, it’d 

86 



be twenty or thirty thousand 
a year.” He smiled at her con- 
solingly. 

She still refused to smile 
back. Her face was calm and 
still. 

“Forty,” she said. 

“Forty?" He frowned. 

“Forty thousand a year, 
Tom, for the four of us.” 

He shook his head. Her 
words seemed to buzz in his 

6£IX*S. 

“Forty thousand?” he ech- 
oed. “How do you know?” 

“I've been checking up.” 

“But Josi — ” He ran out of 
words, trying not to think 
what he could not help think- 
ing. “You didn’t suppose, ser- 
iously — ” 

“I’ve never supposed any- 
thing else,” she replied. And 
he wondered then how she 
could look him in the eye and 
say it. “I’ve been waiting for 
this for a long time, Tom — 
longer than you’d believe. 
Since my first baby was 
born.” 

H E shook his head again, 
unbelievingly. 

“We can do it now,” she 
said. “With your increase in 
salary and if we use the sav- 
ings and borrow against your 
pension. We’ll have enough 
for five years; and by that 
time you’ll have got another 
income boost.” 

“Josi!” 

“Oh, stop staring like that!” 
she snapped, suddenly. “Did 
you think I’d let my boys miss 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




out on a chance at what the 
real world once was, if there 
was any way at all to give 
them even a taste of it?” 

He sat back on the couch, 
dazed. “It isn’t like you.” 

“Because I’ve been a good 
wife all these years and done 
what you wanted, and lived 
where you wanted? You 
thought I never had a selfish 
desire of my own? Oh, Tom, 
Tom!” She clutched his hands 
with a strength that shocked 
him. “How long are you go- 
ing to go on pretending that 
people are still like they were 
in the old days? There’s no 
civilization left now. You 
ought to know that! It’s 
claw, tooth and nail ! And I’m 
looking after my children!” 

“Josi,” he said. 

She shook her head at 
him. “Tom,” she said, “Do 
you know how many people 
there are on Earth now ?” 

“Yes,” he said. “And I 
know they’re considering laws 
to control the population ex-, 
pansion.” 

“Control it!” She laughed 
like someone lie had never 
seen before. “If they’d talk- 
ed of controling it fifty years 
ago, it might have helped us. 
What’s going to help us now? 
It’s my babies that have to 
grow up in a world where 
there’s ten people for every 
job and no future for even the 
ones who get it. The only way 
they can live is if they make 
the right friends. And the 
only way they can meet the 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



right friends is to go where 
they are. And that’s the Pre- 
serves !” 

“Josi!” said Tom. “Noth- 
ing like that’s necessary. 1 
hope I’ve made a moderate 
success of myself in the 
world. And I can truthfully 
say I’ve done it by decent, 
honorable methods!” 

“You !” she cried. “Oh, you! 
The great anachronism !” 

“Josi — ” But she was Be- 
yond all reasoning.

A S Tom came in through 
his outer office on his 
way to his desk the following 
morning, the rubber plant 
took his eye again. It grated 
on his overwrought nerves 
like a shabby challenge. He 
was on the verge of bursting 
out at Christine to get rid of 
it, when he became suddenly 
aware of its extraordinarily 
protected position on a new 
little ledge, hugging the wall 
by her desk — now pushed to 
the farthest possible distance 
from the desk of Bera Karl- 
son, who had moved her own 
equipment in on the opposite 
side of the room. Abruptly he 
realized that he had been on 
the verge of taking out his 
own unhappiness on an un- 
derling — a thing he had 
never before allowed himself 
to do. He nodded to both wo- 
men ; and made himself smile. 
“Good morning,” he said. 
They answered together —

WILLIAM W. STUART 





Bera with a tinge of tension 
in her voice, Christine almost 
in a whisper. He went on into 
his own private office, the 
door sucking gently closed be- 
hind him. 

He dropped in the chair at 
his own desk; and for a min- 
ute he sat limply, his eyes 
closed. The long, unfinished, 
unclear, unrewarding argu- 
ment with Josi the evening 
before had left him drained of 
energy and clogged with bit- 
terness. He had gained noth- 
ing but her promise to let him 
think this matter of the Pre- 
serves over for a few days be- 
fore talking of it again. 

He straightened with an ef- 
fort and glanced at his ap- 
pointment screen. The name 
of Orval Lasron glowed at 
him from its gray, opaque 
surface. He stared at the two 
words, troubled by some 
slightly ominous echo at the 
back of his mind, which they 
evoked. Surely, he did not 
know the man? After a mo- 
ment, he gave up. Buzzing 
Bera to admit Lasron, he got 
up and crossed over to the one 
wall-wide window that looked 
down to the Executive Wait- 
ing Lounge, three floors be- 
low. 

He heard Bera’s voice speak 
out over the annunciator down 
there and a stocky, short man 
in middle age, with lumpy 
features, rose from a table. 
He crossed over to where the 
angle of the wall below cut 
him off from Tom’s sight. 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



After a second, the man 
rose into sight on a floating 
magnetic disk, which came to 
a stop outside the window. 
Tom touched the dissolve but- 
ton and extended his hand. 
Lasron stepped through the 
now non-existent window. His 
handshake was brisk and im- 
personal. 

“I interrupted your drink 
down there,” said Tom. ‘‘May 
I—” 

“No, thanks,” said the 
other. 

T OM led the way back to 
his desk and both men 
seated themselves. Face to 
face, Lasron was somewhat 
more impressive than he had 
been at a distance. There was 
a hardness to his bunchy fea- 
tures and his eyes seemed to 
show the light of a constant, 
buried anger. 

“And what can I do for you, 
Mr. Lasron?” 

“You don't know me,” stat- 
ed Lasron. He crossed one 
thick leg over the knee of the 
other. 

“No.” 

“I’m the local agent for the 
Secretarial Code,” said Las- 
ron. “I didn’t know you, eith- 
er. You were in Sales before, 
were you ?” 

“That’s right. Our labor 
relations were all handled 
higher up.” 

“Yes.” Lasron shifted in 
his chair with an abrupt, im- 
patient movement. “Well, 
you’ve got a holdover. Chris- 
tine Nyall.” 



89 




“I know,” said Tom, sober- 
ing. “A shame that — ” 

“I don’t think so,” inter- 
rupted Lasron. “Christine 
doesn’t think so.v She intends 
to remain on the Job. Quite 
happy in it. It’s standard pro- 
cedure in these cases to drop 
around on the one in Man- 
agement responsible. Just as 
a reminder.” He paused. “You 
understand.” 

“No,” answered Tom, sit- 
ting straighter. “I don’t think 
I do.” 

Lasron sighed. 

“All right,” he said. “Any 
evidence of prejudice and 
we’ll slap a writ on you for a 
fine. Deal with an illegal out- 
fit and we’ll spend half the 
money in the treasury, if 
necessary, to get a felony rap 
to stick to you.” 

“Now, wait! Now, look 
here,” said Tom. “Just a min- 
ute, Lasron. Just what do you 
think you’re insinuating? My 
record is perfectly clean and 
fair. I know some people on 
Management Level have the 
popular reputation of pulling 
dirty tricks in cases like this. 
But for your private informa- 
tion—” 

Lasron waved one hand, 
wearily. 

“I have a code of ethics!” 
snapped Tom. “No, I don’t 
pretend I wouldn’t like to see 
Christine happily retired. But 
— ” He became suddenly 
aware that he was talking to 
a man who was staring out 
the window, humming a small 

90 



tune nervously to himself, his 
fingers beating small, jerky 
time on the arm of his chair. 

“Good,” said Lasron, when 
Tom stopped. He got to his 
feet. His eyes of buried an- 
ger burnt briefly and imper- 
sonally on Tom, as if the man 
across the desk was some- 
thing mechanical, trouble- 
some and potentially danger- 
ous. “I won't take up any 
more of your time.” 

Tom rose also, and punched 
the dissolve button. 

“Drop by any time,” he 
said, defiantly. “You don’t 
have to make an appointment. 
Just walk in.” 

Lasron looked at him brief- 
ly. He appeared to be about 
to say something, then turn- 
ed away. He nodded his head 
and stepped through the dis- 
solve window onto the disk 
which wafted him down and 
out of sight. 

Tom was left standing with 
a feeling of ugly inadequacy. 
He half-turned to his interof- 
fice with the intention of call- 
ing Arm Brewer, to report the 
agent’s threats. But it would 
be a bad beginning in the new 
position to go running for help 
right off the bat. He turned 
away again. 

Then he thought of calling 
in Christine and challenging 
her about the agent’s behavi- 
or. But that was not strictly 
fair, either. Time, he thought, 
sitting down at his desk again 
— time would iron matters out 
automatically. 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




T WO days later Josi re- 
minded him of his prom- 
ise to consider the move to 
the Preserves. He put her 
off, saying he had not had 
the chance to think, pleading 
the situation at the office. 

“Just don’t take too long, 
Tom,” she said. 

She said it in such an odd, 
unusual tone that he looked 
at her startled, and then look- 
ed away again before she 
could catch him staring. He 
wanted to ask her what she 
meant; but discovered sud- 
denly he was afraid to. 

That night he slept badly, 
and when he did get to sleep 
he slept late. 

It was later than usual 
when he stepped through the 
entrance to his outer office. 
He could feel immediately 
that there was something 
wrong. As she answered his 
good morning, Christine kept 
her eyes fixed on the surface 
of her desk ; while Bera, glan- 
cing deliberately at him, gave 
him a look of peculiar out- 
rage, features set and a little 
pale. Tom shouldered past 
them both into the security of 
his own office, hoping to 
avoid the matter, whatever 
it was. 

He was given no choice. On 
his appointment screen, Bera’s 
name stood out brilliantly, in 
the space where his first ap- 
pointment should have been. 
Tom hesitated for a moment, 
to put a small barrier of time 
between his entrance and 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



Bera’s admission; and then 
pressed her button and sum- 
moned her in. 

She came and sat down op- 
posite him. It was abundant- 
ly clear that a crisis point had 
been reached, for as she sat 
on the edge of her chair her 
body was rigid with the glass- 
brittle tension of a woman on 
the verge of explosion. 

T HEY began calmly enough, 
but Bera’s low voice quick- 
ly climbed the scale toward 
hysteria. She did not want to 
complain. He knew that she 
never complained; but — she 
reminded Tom of all the years 
she had worked for him. She 
asked him if he had ever had 
any reason to complain. She 
thought that over the years — 
and so on. Inevitably came 
the tears. 

She sat in the big visitor’s 
chair and cried, a large-boned, 
not unlovely woman at the 
end of her thirties; but past 
the point where tears could 
look good on her. Tom gave 
her a drink and waited until 
the emotion was controlled. 

He was shocked to discover 
the whimpering fear that un- 
derlay her outburst. 

“Why, Bera,” he said, as 
soon as she was in fit shape to 
listen, “what makes you think 
I’d ever get rid of you? Why, 
I could no longer get along 
without you than — ” he hunt- 
ed for an enormous metaphor 
and could think of nothing 
but— “my right arm.” 



91 




Bera gulped, “But She has 
tenure and I haven’t, and you 
only need one of us.” 

“Then I’ll just have to put 
up with both of you,” he said, 
in a poor attempt to be jocu- 
lar. “Anything else is ridicu- 
lous.” He frowned. “Besides, 
I think after a while she’ll get 
tired of not having a real job 
to do around here, and retire.” 
“No, she won’t — the old bid- 
dy!” said Bera with sudden 
viciousness. “She wants to 
hang on forever.” 

“Now, you know that’s not 
true,” said Tom. “She just 
liked her job. All of us do.” 
“Well, I don’t care. She 
doesn’t belong in our office. 
Why doesn’t she just go?” 
“Where do you want her to 
go?” asked Tom, reasonably. 

“I don’t care. It isn’t as if 
she’d starve to death. You 
make as much money retired 
nowadays as you do working.” 
“Well, she’s not going to get 
your job,” said Tom. “Now 
straighten up, Bera, and for- 
get this nonsense. As far as 
I’m concerned, Christine has 
already retired.” 

"Then she shouldn’t be al- 
lowed to clutter up the office 
with things like that plant of 
hers.” 

“Why, it’s not a bad look- 
ing plant,” said Tom. “I think 
it’s rather a nice idea, having 
it there. Hardly anyone keeps 
flowers or plants around now- 
adays.” 

“It gets in my way,” said 
Bera, sullenly. Tom felt it 

92 



was time to put his foot down. 

“I’m sure you can work 
around it,” he said. “Try it 
for a few weeks, anyway. If 
Christine is still here after 
then, and the plant still inter- 
feres around the office, we’ll 
see about getting rid of it. 
All right?” 

Tom got to his feet, which 
forced her to rise as well. 
“Try and get along with 
Christine, then, Bera. I’m 
leaving now. I just dropped 
by today to take a look at 
things. You can tell anyone 
who calls that I won’t be back 
before tomorrow. Handle 
them as you like.” 

“Yes.” She wiped her eyes. 

“So long, then.” He went 
out, closing the door on her 
answering good-by. In the 
outer office, Christine was sit- 
ting at her desk, her face ex- 
pressionless and a sheet of 
paper filled with aimless dood- 
lings before her. 

“Well, I’m off for the rest 
of the day, Christine,” he 
said. 

“Good morning, Mr. Callo- 
way,” she replied, without 
looking up. 

He went out the door. 

W HEN the tension in the 
outer office did not im- 
prove, he took a trip to the 
other side of the building to 
talk to Arm. 

“Tom !” Arm jumped to his 
feet as Tom entered, and came 
forward bouncily, his heavy 
face smiling under its white 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




hair. , “How’s our newest 
member upstairs here? Have 
a drink?" 

“No thanks,” said Tom. 
“How’ve you been, Arm?” 
“How could I be? Eighty- 
seven and sound as the Com- 
pany’s credit rating!” Arm 
slapped his wide chest. “Why 
don’t you and Josi step out 
with me one of these nights 
and find out for yourselves? 
See if the old bachelor can’t 
outdo you yet?” 

“I wouldn’t doubt it. I’ll 
talk to Josi about it,” said 
Tom, smiling. “Arm, I hate 
to come funning to you with 
troubles right away, but I’ve 
got stuck in a situation.” 
“That the straight sheet?” 
Arm punched for a drink and 
set it on the edge of his desk. 
“What is it?” 

“Christine Nyall. Old Walt’s 

oppppfurv 99 

“Christine — ? Oh, the hold- 
over!” Arm looked at Tom, 
pulled a long face and rocked 
abruptly with hearty laugh- 
ter. “Now, that is rough. If 
only she’d been some young 
bounce, huh, Tom?” 

Tom smiled agreeably, if 
perfunctorily. 

“Well, well.” Arm sobered. 
“So you’ve got old Walt’s girl 
on your hands. You knew 
about her and Walt? Yes, I 
see you did. Well, now, what’s 
the problem?” 

“Well, since I brought Bera 
up with me. I’ve really no 
need for Christine. But she’s 
trying to stick it out.” 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



“They all do.” 

“For myself, I don’t mind 
too much — after all, she’s 
bound to retire eventually. 
But it crowds the office, you 
know how we are for space. 
And, worst of all, she’s upset- 
ting Bera.” 

“Well, now, that is serious,” 
said Arm. “A good secretary, 
broken in over the years. I 
can see why you wouldn't 
want her disturbed. Why 
don’t you do something about 
it?” 

“But that’s the point. What 
can I do?” said Tom. “She’s 
got tenure. The representa- 
tive of the Secretarial Code 
was around just a week or so 
ao-o to remind me of that. 
What can I do?” 

Arm looked across the desk 
at him with a curious expres- 
sion on his big face. 

“You haven’t been ap- 
proached yet, then?” he said, 
slowly. 

“Approached? By who?” 

Arm’s drink had been sit- 
ting unnoticed all this time. 
He picked it up now and sip- 
ped at it. 

“There’s people,” he said, 
“who make a point of being 
useful in just such situa- 
tions.” 

“There are?” Tom search- 
ed his expression for a clue. 
“In the face of the tenure 
law? What can they do? Who 
are they, anyway?” 

“They contact you.” 

“But I mean — oh,” said 
Tom. “Oh, oh I seel” 



93 




“I don’t know anything 
about them myself,” Arm 
said, sipping on his drink. 
“Nothing whatsoever. I’ve 
just heard about them.” 

“Of course,” said Tom. 
There was a fumbling mo- 
ment of silence. 

“Sure you won’t have a 
drink, after all?” 

“Thanks,” said Tom auto- 
matically. Arm had already 
punched for a full glass with- 
out waiting for an answer. 
Now he handed the drink 
over. Tom took it, his eyes 
staring unseeingly through 
the wall of Aim’s office. 

Will !” said Josi, meeting 
him at the front door, 
when he arrived at home. 

“Hello, honey.” He kissed 
her. They went inside. 

“You’ve been drinking,” she 
said. 

“I had a few at the office 
with Arm,” he answered, as 
they sat down. “He wants us 
to go out with him one of 
these nights.” 

“That’s nice,” said Josi. 
“You don’t sound very en- 
thusiastic,” he said. 

“No, I suppose not.” 
“Josi!” he burst out. “Josi, 
will you snap out of it? Can’t 
you understand I’ve got a cri- 
sis brewing in that office of 
mine? If I don’t handle this 
right, what do you think my 
chances of promotion will 
be?” 

“I’m just waiting,” she 
said. 

94 



“Here I am up to my ears 
in business troubles — ” 

“And spending the morn- 
ing getting drunk with Arm.” 
It developed into a first 
class fight. 

Ill 

T HE outer office had be- 
come an armed camp. 
There was no disguising the 
atmosphere of antagonism 
that existed there. Tom dodg- 
ed through it as quickly as 
he could, and remained buried 
in the inner office during the 
hours of his working day. 

But this was no solution. 
Bera became more and more 
unreliable until it became ob- 
vious, even to Tom, that her 
work had become clearly sec- 
ondary to her feud with 
Christine. On Tuesday, at 
the beginning of the third 
week, Tom was disturbed at 
his desk by what could only 
be the sounds of a scuffle. 

He went swiftly to the door 
of the outer office and jerked 
it open. The two women were 
standing facing each other, 
breathing hard, and the jar 
which held the plant was 
clutched with fierce protec- 
tiveness in the arms of Chris- 
tine. As the door opened, she 
turned to look at Tom for a 
single moment, then turned 
back and put down the plant 
once more in its accustomed 
place. She reseated herself, 
silently. Bera turned and 
walked jerkily back to her 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




own desk and also sat down. 
Neither one said a word. 

He waited until they were 
ostensibly busy again, then 
walked through the office and 
out of the front door. He did 
not say a word to Bera; and 
the back of his neck was 
aware that she stared after 
him with bitter, fearful eyes, 
while the woman across from 
her sat silent and depressed, 
her head down and her eyes 
hopelessly fixed on her desk. 

Feeling as if he was chok- 
ing, Tom made his way out of 
the building. He avoided the 
lobby lounge below and took 
an aircab to a rooftop bar 
neart>y — the Parisien, it was 
called. Its small round tables 
and wire chairs were imita- 
tive of an old-fashioned side- 
walk cafe. He ordered a tall 
scotch and tried to relax. 

Things, he thought, could 
not go on like this. Twenty- 
four hours had been the limit 
on family quarrels between 
Josi and himself for years 
now. But the present one 
about the move to the Pre- 
serves seemed to renew itself 
daily. Softly, he pounded on 
the white, slick surface of the 
table with his fist. Trouble 
at the office. Trouble at home. 
And the two things feeding 
on each other to keep them- 
selves alive. The tension be- 
tween Josi and himself was 
blurring his usual decisive- 
ness so that he was fumbling 
the office problem. And the 
office problem wore his 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



nerves thin so that one word 
from Josi was enough to set 
him off. Why couldn’t Josi be 
a help instead of a hindrance 
at a time like this? And why 
couldn’t Christine be sensible 
and retire? 

T HE scotch came. He ac- 
cepted it automatically, 
indifferent to the anachronism 
of a live waiter instead of the 
usual delivery panel set in the 
table. The truth was, he had 
started out with a sneaking 
sympathy for Christine. It 
was not impossible for him to 
put himself in her shoes, to 
feel an empathy with her. He 
had, therefore, been half-in- 
clined to let things drift, to 
let her sit out her remaining 
days in his office — perhaps 
even in time to give her small 
bits and pieces of work to 
make her feel necessary. He 
had never imagined such a 
violent reaction, however, 
from Bera. Who would have 
supposed. 

A shadow fell abruptly 
across his table. 

He looked up and saw gaz- 
ing .down at him a distin- 
guished looking man of his 
own age. A handsome fellow, 
slim, w r ith a touch of easy 
amusement at the corners of 
his thin mouth. 

“Well, Mr. Calloway,” said 
the man, “you’re a hard per- 
son to get in touch with.” 

He sat down. Tom stared 
at him in astonishment. 
“Hard?” He looked more 

95 




closely at the man. “Do I 
know you?” 

“May I introduce myself?” 
He put the question with 
such unnatural stilted for- 
mality that for a second Tom 
did not realize that it was an 
actual question, and not a 
rhetorical one. 

“Is there any reason why 
you shouldn’t?” asked Tom. 

“Joe Smith,” said the other, 
taking this as permission and 
offering his hand. “Utility 
Services.” 

Tom shook hands automa- 
tically. 

“Utility Services?” 

“Of course you don’t know 
us. We aren’t listed. In fact,” 
Joe Smith turned to signal 
the anachronistic waiter, “le- 
gally we don’t exist.” 

A bell rang in Tom’s mind. 
He sat up straight behind his 
scotch and looked penetra- 
tingly at his visitor. 

“And illegally?” he asked. 
The man laughed. 

“We understand you have a 
problem, Mr. Calloway — 
thanks—” he accepted his 
glass from the waiter. “A 
holdover.” 

“Who told you?” 

“Why,” said Smith, “it’s a 
matter of public record, isn’t 
it?” He looked at Tom. “We’re 
prepared to help you out.” 
“How?” 

Smith waved a hand. 

44T\EPENDS on the difficul- 
1 J ty. Once it was merely 
a matter of offering a job 

96 



with some dummy firm. But 
the Secretarial Code is well up 
on simple tricks like that, 
lately. In the case of your 
Christine — let’s see. She was 
supposed to have been having 
a long-term affair with her 
former employer, wasn’t she? 
Perhaps someone who resem- 
bled him a great deal could 
bring about her resignation.” 
“Now, look here,” said Tom. 
“Yes, Mr. Calloway?” 

“I certainly wouldn’t stand 
for anything like that.” 

Smith raised his eyebrows. 
“What did you expect?” He 
leaned forward over the table, 
lowering his voice. “I’ll tell 
you what you expected — a mi- 
racle. We don’t deal in mira- 
cles. Just results.” 

Tom flushed. 

“All right, Smith,” he said. 
“I don’t think we’ve got any 
business to do together.” 

“I think we have,” said 
Smith. “Or rather, you have 
business to do with us. If 
not now, later. We’re a busi- 
ness fact of life in this mod- 
ern world, Mr. Calloway. Ug- 
ly, if you insist on looking at 
us that way, but just as un- 
avoidable as any other fact 
of life.” 

“I don’t think so,” said 
Tom grimly. 

“Don’t you ?” queried Smith. 
“Open your eyes, Mr. Callo- 
way. This isn’t the last cen- 
tury. It’s the present. There’s 
no way to hide from the facts 
of life now.” 

“I’m not sure I know what 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




you’re talking about,” said 
Tom. “But I’ll tell you this. 
I’ve lived by my own code of 
ethics all my life. And got 
along all right. So go peddle 
your dirty papers someplace 
else.” 

. “No, no,” said Smith, shak- 
ing his head. “It’s all very 
fine to have ethics, Mr. Callo- 
way, but they simply don't 
work in business. They’ve 
gotten to be a luxury nobody 
can afford any more. Save 
your ethics for home. Tell 
them to the kids for bedtime 
stories when you tuck them 
in for the night. But don’t 
go messing up your career 
with them. You’ll regret it. 
Indeed you will, Calloway. 
People like this Christine ex- 
pect to get kicked out. They 
just hang around creating a 
fuss until they are.” 

WTF you think you can say 
•l that — ” Tom checked him- 
self suddenly, remembering 
the office as it had been late- 
ly. Remembering Josi. “My 
wife — ” he began, without 
thinking. Then he stopped. 
“What about your wife?” 
“None of your business!” 
“Oh? But I take it,” said 
Smith, looking at him closely, 
“you weren’t about to listen 
to her, either?” 

Tom shuddered suddenly 
and quite unexpectedly. 

“It’s all nonsense,” he said. 
“Someone walk over your 
grave?” said Smith, not en- 
tirely unmaliciously. “You 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



ought to know the truth as 
well as your wife. As well as 
me, for that matter.” He 
waved his arm out over the 
parapet of the rooftops, at 
the endless buildings sur- 
rounding them. “Look at that. 
Full up. Ripe. Starting to 
rot, wouldn’t you say?” He 
grinned at Tom. 

“What’re you talking 
about?” said Tom. “There’s 
unlimited frontiers. New 
worlds. .” 

“You want to go? Do I 
want to go ?” Smith sat back, 
shaking his head and took a 
drink from his glass. “Easier 
to stay here and face facts, 
Calloway. And the fact you’ve 
got to face — ” he tapped with 
his fingernail on the shiny 
white tabletop, his nail mak- 
ing a hard clicking sound 
against it — “is that you must 
do for this Christine or, indi- 
rectly, she’s going to do for 
you. If you don’t get her out 
of that office, the mess’ll 
grow. It’ll grow until you find 
yourself into it too deep to 
pull yourself out. I’ve seen 
this sort of thing before.” He 
got up. “Think about that 
Calloway. You or her. And 
the longer you hesitate, the 
more likely it's going to be 
both of you.” 

I T was evening before Tom 
found Christine Nyall. 
After Smith left, Tom had 
tried to call her at the office. 
Bera hold him the older wo- 
man had gone for the day. 

97 




Bera did not have Christine’s 
address, either, so Tom had 
been forced to go to a pub- 
lic tracing center. It took the 
center three hours to come up 
with a list of places where 
she might be found. 

He located her at last, sit- 
ting at one of the small tables 
around the wide expanse of 
dance floor in one of the mid- 
age groups recreation centers. 
She sat alone, a barely touch- 
ed drink in front of her, the 
glowingly white translucent 
dance floor throwing a pale 
illumination on her overpow- 
dered face. He strode over 
and sat down opposite Ik 

“Christine,” he said. 

She turned from her blank 
contemplation of the dancing 
couples on the floor and look- 
ed at him. As his identity 
registered, her features slid 
into the carefully controlled 
expression he was used to see- 
ing at the office. 

“Mr. Calloway,” she mur- 
mured. 

“Hello.” He stumbled, sud- 
denly at a loss for words. "Er 
-^another drink?” 

She touched the glass be- 
fore her. 

“Thanks, no,” she said. 

“I see,” he said, “Well, I 
think I’ll have one.” He press- 
ed buttons and waited for a 
few short seconds until a filled 
glass rose from the slot in the 
center of the table. He took 
it, swallowed largely and put 
it back on the table. “I’ve had 
a hard time finding you.” 

98 



The words reminded him 
immediately of the man nam- 
ed Smith. He put his drink 
down with a gesture of revul- 
sion. He looked at Christine, 
almost pleadingly. 

“Look, Christine,” he said, 
“do you really think you’d 
feel happier belonging to my 
office staff than you would, 
retired ?” 

She reached for her glass 
and turned it. 

“Yes,” she said, “Yes, I 
do.” 

“You know,” he said, try- 
ing to joke, “sooner or later 
we all have to quit.” 

She looked up sharply. He 
saw her eyes were terrified. 

“Not until retirement age !” 
she said, “I’ve got tenure!” 

“Of course, of course. I 
know you’ve got tenure,” said 
Tom. “But you do see — you’re 
just putting off the inevitable, 
don’t you?” 

“I only want my rights. 
That’s all!” 

T OM took a heavy gulp 
from his glass. He push- 
ed it away from him. 

“Look,” he said, “I want us 
to be friends. I know how 
I’d feel if I was — well — put 
in an awkward position with 
some years yet to go to re- 
tirement. I’d like to do what’s 
best for you. And I know 
Bera. She can be difficult to 
get along with.” 

“I don’t mind,” said Chris- 
tine carefully. 

“Oh come now,” said Tom. 
GORDON R. DICKSON 




“Informally— just between 

the two of us — I know she’s 
been raising cain ever since 
we moved into the new of- 
fice.” 

“Bera’s all right,” she an- 
swered. “I like Bera.” 

Tom gaped at her. The 
statement was too monstrous 
to refute. 

“Christine!” he burst out, 
finally. “Let’s be honest, any- 
way!” She looked stubbornly 
down at her drink. “Look, if 
you really want to stay, you 
can. I’ll talk to Bera. Or the 
three of us will all get to- 
gether and thrash this thing 
out. That is, if you really 
want to stay.” 

She glanced up obliquely, 
almost slyly, at him. 

“I can stay anyway,” she 
said.) “My tenure guarantees 
it” 

“Of course! Of course you 
can stay !” cried Tom. “That’s 
not what I’m talking about. 
I’m talking about fitting you 
in, making a useful place for 
you.” 

“That’s all right.” He rais- 
ed her head to look him 
squarely in the eye. “You 
don’t have to bother about 
me.” 

“Good Lord !” shouted Tom. 
“Do you like things the way 
they are?” 

“You might as well give up, 
Mr. Calloway,” she said. “I 
know what my rights are, 
and I’m not going to give 
them up. If you’ve got any 
questions you can call up the 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



Secretarial Code and talk to 
Mr. Lasron. Of course, I’ll 
have to report to him you 
tried to talk to me here, to- 
day.” 

For a moment Tom stared 
at her in amazement. 

“You stupid woman!” he 
burst out finally. “Can’t you 
see I’m trying to help?” 

Christine’s face went white 
and frightened. She jerked 
as if she had been struck. For 
a moment she sat as if para- 
lyzed; then she made a small 
noise in her throat and scram- 
bled up. She was hurrying 
off, before Tom could stop 
her, between the tables. 

“Christine! Wait!” he call- 
ed after her. But she was al- 
ready gone. 

I T was late when he at last 
got home. Josi was wait- 
ing for him in the lounge 
room. 

“Had your supper?” she 
asked a little sharply, as he 
came in. 

“I’m not hungry.” He drop- 
ped into a chair. 

“Would you like a drink? 
Or — ” she stood over him — 
“have you had too many al- 
ready?” 

“Josi,” he said wearily, put- 
ting his head in his hands, 
“don’t start in on me now.” 
She sat down opposite him. 
“I’m sorry, Tom,” she said. 
“But we’ve got something to 
talk over. I’ve been waiting 
for you since this afternoon.” 
“Can’t it wait?” 



99 




“No, Tem.” 

A note he had never before 
heard in her voice made him 
look up. 

“I’m leaving things up to 
you, Tom,” she said. “I went 
down to the tourist agency 
and told them to go ahead 
with our reservations.” 

“Josi!” 

“You listen to me now. The 
plans are at a premium. I 
can’t afford to wait. The Pre- 
serves may be filled up, or 
the price increased any day 
now, to where we can't afford 
it.” 

“Josi, listen!” 

“No. Now I’m doing the 
talking, Tom,” she said. “I 
told you I was going through 
with this. And I meant it. 
The reservation is in my 
name. If you won’t come 
along, then I’m getting a di- 
vorce. My settlement will pay 
for the first few years of the 
plan ; and after that we’ll 
work things out any way we 
can. But whether you like it 
or not, whether you come or 
not, the boys and I are leav- 
ing for the Preserves. It’s up 
to you, Tom.” 

She i-ose to her feet and left 
him, sitting in the lounge, 
numb and old and alone. 

IV 

T HE next morning found 
him having breakfast at 
a poolside restaurant not far 
from the office. He had slip- 
ped out of the house to avoid 

100 



Josi, for reasons that were at 
the moment unclear to him. 
He sat at his small table un- 
der a striped awning, staring 
out at the early morning 
swimmers in the pool. The 
coffee seemed tasteless. 

He had spent the whole of 
a wakeful night trying to be- 
lieve what Josi had told him. 
Accepting it was something 
else again. First he had to 
believe she would do such a 
thing. It was all the more 
wildly improbable for the rea- 
son that he believed Josi still 
loved him. Only there seem- 
ed to be some startling and 
hitherto unsuspected limits to 
that love. 

How, he wondered, staring 
at the pool, had Josi reached 
such a point? He tried to 
think back over their discus- 
sions — well, be honest and 
call them arguments. Had 
there been some point at 
which he had driven her to 
desperation ? Thinking back, 
he could remember no such 
point. In fact, he had never 
given a definite “no” to* the 
idea. He had merely been 
doubting and wanting to put 
off his decision until he could 
settle the problem of Chris- 
tine. 

That could only mean — he 
came back to the point not 
for the first nor even for the 
hundredth time since the pre- 
vious evening — that Josi had 
simply long ago decided to 
eliminate him from the fam- 
ily. She had thought not my 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




husband, our family; but sim- 
ply my children and I. She 
had cut him out. 

Or had he ever belonged? 

After a while, he got up and 
went to the office. 

When he came in this morn- 
ing, Bera was absorbed in her 
work ; but Christine looked up 
at him with a momentary 
strange, unreadable expres- 
sion. He brushed past both 
of them and went on into his 
own office. 

He sat down at his desk. 
He had never been an early 
morning drinker; but now he 
punched for Scotch. After a 
moment, the tall glass rose to 
the surface of his desk and 
he took it. It tasted alien and 
bitter, like the coffee he had 
drunk earlier. But he forced 
himself to swallow it. 

After a little while, the 
hard edges of his world sof- 
tened somewhat. He straight- 
ened up and looked at his ap- 
pointment screen. 

There, waiting for him, was 
the name of Lasron. He got 
up from his desk and looked 
out the window, down into the 
lounge. 

T HERE was Lasron wait- 
ing. Tom made out the 
man’s thick body seated alone 
at a table before a glass from 
which he was not drinking. 
His fingers seemed to be 
drumming on the table top. 
Impatient. Well, he would just 
have to wait. Team came back 
to his desk and pushed the 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



button that summoned Chris- 
tine. 

She came in hesitantly, 
closing the door behind her 
instead of letting it suck shut 
automatically, and approach- 
ed his desk. 

“Sit down,” said Tom. 

She seated herself careful- 
ly on the edge of the big vis- 
itor’s chair. 

“Christine,” he said, “I 
wanted to talk to you.” 

“I know,” she answered. 
She was watching her own 
fingers, which she had laced 
together and was turning, 
backwards and forwards, 
in her lap. 

“You know?” he said. 

“I’m so terribly sorry, Mr. 
Calloway,” she said. “I want 
to apologize — ” 

He stared at her in startle- 
ment. But she was hurrying 
on, tripping over her own 
words in her haste. 

“I just couldn’t help it af- 
ter working here so long. I 
couldn’t help thinking it was 
our office — mine and Mr. 
Onegh’s. And then, when 
you’re older and you’ve got 
no one — to be cut loose, to 
just eat and sleep and die and 
be forgotten — you go a little 
crazy, I guess.” 

“Well, now,” said Tom, 
“Christine — ” 

“And they make matters 
worse for us down at the Sec- 
retarial Code. They warn us 
Management will try all sorts 
of dirty tricks to make us re- 
sign, when we’ve got tenure. 

701 




They get us so worked up, 
Mr. Calloway, that we can’t 
trust anyone. And I didn’t 
trust you. I called Mr. Lasron 
last night, after you talked to 
me. It wasn’t until after I 
punched off the phone, that I 
thought to remember you 
hadn’t been anything but 
kind. You didn’t even com- 
plain about the plant." 

Tom found his voice a little 
hoarse, and cleared it. “No 
point in being unfair." 

“I know. I just couldn’t be- 
lieve it." She twisted her 
hands. “I want to tell you 
about that plant, Mr. Callo- 
way. It — ’’ She hesitated, and 
her powdered face twisted in- 
to a slight grotesqueness. “It 
meant a good deal to me. You 
must know about me and Mr. 
Onegh.” 

“Yes,” said Tom. 

“A lot of people knew.” She 
was stroking one blue-veined 
hand with the fingers of the 
other, as if in fascination with 
the process. “They knew I 
loved him and they guessed — 
that was before his wife died 
— that we were getting away 
for a weekend, now and then. 
But nobody here knew we 
once had nearly a whole year 
together.” 

T OM jerked his head back 
from the window. 

“Yes." She nodded a little. 
“It was before you came to 
the Company. There was an 
underground city supply unit 
to be set up in the Midlands, 

102 



on Venus. The Company took 
the bid. Mr. Onegh was sent 
out as Management Represen- 
tative when we got the job. 
I took a leave of absence; and 
he pulled some strings to get 
me an appointment on the 
Government Inspection Crew. 
So we both went out, and no 
one here knew about it.” 

She stopped. Tom was star- 
ing at her. She went on. 

“It was a year,’-’ she said. 
“We could have stayed on Ve- 
nus. I wanted to. But Walter 
— ” Her voice trailed off. 

“He thought,” said Tom, 
and was jarred at the sound 
of his own voice, so strange 
it sounded, “of his wife and 
his job here.” 

“Yes,” she Whispered. 

Her index finger made lit- 
tle circles on the arm of the 
chair. She spoke again. 

“He was a coward,” she 
said. Tom started and looked 
at her with a sort of horror. 
“I thought you loved him?” 
“I did.” She raised her 
head. “He wasn’t a coward 
when I first met him. It was 
the years made him that. All 
the years and the sneaking 
around corners with me. And 
the business getting tighter 
and tighter every year, so 
that even someone who’d been 
with the Company as long as 
he had didn’t feel safe.” 
“Class A Management. 
With tenure.” Tom’s throat 
was dry, suddenly. 

She smiled sadly at him. 
“Oh, they've got dirty 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




tricks for Management level, 
too,” she said. “When I was 
working with Walter — ” Her 
voice trailed off, embarrassed- 
ly. 

T OM sat still in his chair. 

He opened his mouth, 
closed it again and suddenly, 
almost with violence, shoved 
himself to his feet. Turning, 
he stepped to the office win- 
dow and looked out. Across 
from him, over the airy 
depths of the lounge below, he 
could make out Arm Brewer, 
his white thatch vigorously in 
movement beyond the pane of 
his window on the opposite 
side of the lounge. 

“What about the plant?” 
Tom said without turning. 
“You were going to tell me 
about the rubber plant.” 

“Well, you know how Venus 
is,” her voice rang in his ears. 
“The carbon dioxide blanket, 
the dust storms, nothing 
green anywhere. It was 
against the shipping rules, 
but he took the plant along 
when he went to Venus — for 
me. To make me happy. For 
that one year it grew in our 
home.” 

Out and below Tom, the 
lounge eddied in its steady 
movement of continual 
coming and going. Salesmen, 
jobhunters, caterers, favor- 
seekers, representatives like 
Lasron — the flotsam of the 
commercial sea. All waiting. 
All hungry. 

Yes, thought Tom. 

A TASTE OF TENURE 



Just then, through the 
wide-swinging entrance of the 
lounge came the tall, thin fig- 
ure of Mr. Smith. For a mo- 
ment, Tom hung, not even 
breathing, staring down at 
the tall man. 

Behind him, Christine talk- 
ed on. But he heard her only 
as background noise. Smith 
had just nodded to Lasron, 
sitting at his table; and Las- 
ron had lifted a hand in ac- 
knowledgement. 

Mr. Smith paused to speak 
to the receptionist, his ele- 
gant head a little on one side. 
He turned and went over the 
opposite wall soaring up from 
the lounge. A disk came im- 
mediately to life on the floor, 
and he stepped aboard. It 
bore him upward to the win- 
dow of Arm’s office, opposite. 
The window dissolved before 
him as Arm reached out a 
hand in greeting. They went 
inside together and — did their 
heads turn to look for a mo- 
ment in the direction of Tom's 
office as they went? 

Tom had a sudden diz- 
zying sensation of falling. It 
was as if the lounge below 
reached up with clutching fin- 
gers to drag him down. He 
clung to the window drape 
beside him for a minute, find- 
ing the heavy metallic cloth 
slippery in his damp hands. 
He took a deep breath, 
straightened and turned. 

“Yes, yes,” he said, inter- 
rupting Christine. “I appre- 
ciate your telling me about 



103 




the plant. But I think that 
in spite of the sentimental at- 
tachment you have for it, 
we’ll have to get rid of it.” 

H ER mouth open, she star- 
ed at him. In her aston- 
ishment she looked almost im- 
becilic. 

“You understand,” he went 
on, the words coming auto- 
matically, “I’m a liberal-mind- 
ed man myself. But I can 
hardly be expected to put up 
with a souvenir of this type. 
After all, this is a business 
office, not a bedroom. I was 
a young man once myself — 
fairly recently, too. And I 
had my — er — fun. And I rec- 
ognize that a single woman 
and a man with a perpetually 
ailing wife might have their 
problems op a physical plane. 
But to flaunt mementos of — 
well, it seems to me to be a 
little too much.” 

She looked up at him with 
a rabbit-like fascination, as 
if he had suddenly revealed 
scales and a moveless eye. He 
met her look squarely. It was 
odd. but he felt no need to 
avoid her. His eyes were 
heavy as pebbles in his face, 
and as insensitive to what he 
gazed at. 

“So I'll just ask you to put 
it away somewhere right 
now,” he said. He paused. 
“Naturally, I’m going to have 
to submit a memo on this to 
the Company psychiatrist. I 
believe you need help, Chris- 
tine. Women often do at your 

104 



age. I’ll do what I can by at- 
taching a complete account 
of what you told me about 
you and Walter — ” 

With one quick, gasping in- 
take of breath, she was on 
her feet. She turned and ran 
from his office. The imper- 
sonal machinery of the door 
closed it politely behind her. 

Tom sat down at his desk. 
He felt as if he should be 
shaking, but he was not. He 
laid his hands on the desktop 
but felt nothing. 

After a while he became 
aware of the sound of Bera’s 
buzzer, calling for his atten- 
tion. But he ignored it. It 
was not until some little time 
after that, that the door to 
his office opened and she 
came in. Her eyes were wide, 
showing too much white; and 
her lips trembled. 

“What is it?” he asked. 

“Mr. Calloway — Mr. Callo- 
way, it’s Christine!” 

H E looked carefully at her. 
“What about Christine?” 
“I’m worried. Perhaps I’ve 
been — I didn't think.” 

“Will you tell me,” he said, 
“what it is? If you don’t 
mind, Bera!” 

“She locked herself in the 
supply closet in our outer of- 
fice. She won’t come out, and 
she doesn’t- — doesn't answer.” 
“Oh?” said Tom. “I see.” 
He took a slow breath and 
leaned back in his chair. 

“I’m scared. She took the 
plant. Oh, Mr. Calloway, I

didn’t mean to be so nasty to 
her! If she’s— ” 

“Control yourself, Bera.” 
Tom got up from his chair. 
“I’m sure it’s quite all right. 
Perhaps the door locked ac- 
cidentally. Perhaps she had 
a little fainting fit in there. 
After all, she’s not as young 
as she once was. Why don’t 
you run down and get the 
janitor up here to unlock the 
door? Don’t make a fuss 
about it. Just say the door’s 
locked and we can’t find the 
key.” 

“Oh, yes! I’ll run!” said 
Bera. “I’ll run right away!” 
She dashed out of the room. 

After she had gone, Tom 
sat still for a second. Then 
he reached out and punched 
for a private connection to 
Arm Brewer on the interof- 
fice phone. 

Arm’s face sprang into 
view on its screen. 

“Who? Oh, Tom. What can 
I do for you?” 

“Just give me a few point- 
ers about something when 
you’ve got time, Arm,” said 
Tom. “Josi and I are think- 
ing of taking one of those 
perpetual tours around the 
Preserves — ” 

“Preserves? Sure!” boom- 
ed Arm. “I’ve been on them. 
Tell you all about it, if you 
want. How’s things down at 
your end there?” 

“I’m afraid I’m going to 
have to let Bera go after all,” 
said Tom, steadily. “And keep 
Christine. Bera’s gone all to 



105 





.pieces lately. Lets her work 
go, and spends all her time 
picking on Christine. Of 
course, there's no tenure 
problem with Bera.” 

“Ah? I hadn’t realized 
that,” said Arm, raising white 
eyebrows. “Well, that settles 
your little problem.” 

“Yes. I’m afraid so.” Tom 
sighed. “Too bad. I’d never 
have considered this if she'd 
— but, well, this is easier all 
around. She's been making 
life hell for Christine.” 
“Yeah. I heard something 
about that. Look, talk to you 
later, okay, Tom? I’ve got a 
little deal on right now.” 
“Fine. Thanks, Arm.” 

“Not at all. Any time.” 
Tom broke the connection 
and sat back, waiting for 
Bera to return. For a while 
he heard nothing but silence. 
But then, at last, there was 
the muffled sound of voices 
reentering his outer office. 
For a moment they murmur- 
ed busily together; then there 
was the sound of a lock turn- 
ing. Then silence. 

— When the scream came, 
he was expecting it. 

High and clear in Bera’s 
voice, he had been expecting 
it all along. Sitting still at 
his desk, he did not move. 
Only the muscles of his body 
froze all together as if the 
blood in them had congealed 
at the sound; and the sweat 
stood suddenly out on his 
forehead like living water 
from the rock. -—END

W HEN you come right 
down to it, there are only 
two things to be done about 
the deadly unwanted by- prod- 
ucts of the atomic age — seal 
them off somehow, or learn to 
live with them. The Atomic 
Energy Commission likes the 
policy of burying atomic 
wastes underground, in care- 
fully selected sites where it 
can be ascertained that there 
will be no low-level water 
tables or other opportunity 
for “leakage”. In spite of the 
fact that any atomic facility 
produces vast amounts of 
"hot” waste, a surprisingly 
large amount of it can be dis- 
posed of in a small space. For 
example, all the low-intensity

wastes of Oak Ridge have 
been buried in a 60-acre area. 
Commission experts calculate 
that one 2- to 300 acre site 
would be enough to bury all 
the wastes produced in the 
northwest for the next 20 
years. As to airborne radio- 
activity — well, ways have to 
be found to live with it. One 
way is indicated by experi- 
ments at Georgia Tech, who 
have been able to cut the 
radioactive cesium content of 
milk by feeding cows on grass 
grown indoors, not in soil but 
in hydroponic tanks. The cut, 
measured against a control 
group of outdoor-pastured 
cows, was dramatic — about 
38%.

THE 

JUNKMAKERS 

BY ALBERT TEICHNER 

ERIC WAS THE BEST ROBOT THEY'D EVER HAD 
—PERFECTLY TRAINED, EVER THOUGHTFUL. 

A JOY TO OWN. NATURALLY THEY 
HAD TO DESTROY HIM ! 



1 

W ENDELL HART had 
drifted, rather than 
plunged, into the underground 
movement. Later, discussing 
it with other members of the 
Savers’ Conspiracy, he found 
they had experienced the same 
slow, almost casual awaken- 
ing. His own, though, had 
come at a more appropriate 
time, just a few weeks before 
the Great Ritual Sacrifice. 

The Sacrifice took place 
only once a decade, on High 



Holy Day at dawn of the 
spring equinox. For days prior 
to it joyous throngs of work- 
ers helped assemble old ve- 
hicles, machine tools and com- 
puters in the public squares, 
crowning each pile with used, 
disconnected robots. In the 
evening of the Day they 
roudly made their private 
eaps on the neat green lawns 
of their homes. These tradi- 
tionally consisted of house- 
hold utensils, electric heaters, 
air conditioners and the fam- 
ily servant. 



10? 




The wealthiest — considered 
particularly blessed— even had 
two or three automatic ser- 
vants beyond the public con- 
tribution, which they de- 
stroyed in private. Their more 
average neighbors crowded in- 
to their gardens for the awe- 
some festivities. The next 
morning everyone could re- 
turn to work, renewed by the 
knowledge that the Festival 
of Acute Shortages would be 
with them for months. 

Like everyone else, Wendell 
had felt his sluggish pulse 
gaining new life as the time 
drew nearer. 

A cybernetics engineer and 
machine tender, he was down 
to ten hours a week of work. 
Many others in the luxury- 
gorged economy had even 
smaller shares of the purpose- 
ful activities that remained. 
At night he dreamed of the 
slagger moving from house to 
house as it burned, melted and 
then evaporated each group 
of junked labor-blocking de- 
vices. He even had glorious 
daydreams about it. Walking 
down the park side of his 
home block, he was liable to 
lose all contact with the out- 
side world and peer through 
the mind’s eye alone at the 
climactic destruction. 

Why, he sometimes won- 
dered, are all these things so 
necessary to our resurrection? 

Marie had the right answer 
for him, the one she had 
learned by rote in early child- 
hood : “All life moves in cycles. 



Creation and progress must 
be preceded by destruction. In 
ancient times that meant we 
had to destroy each other ; but 
for the past century our in- 
herent need for negative mo- 
ments has been sublimated — 
that’s the word the news 
broadcasts use — into proper 
destruction.” His wife smiled. 
“I’m only giving the moral 
reason, of course. The practi- 
cal one’s obvious.” 

Obvious it was, he had to 
concede. Men needed to work, 
not out of economic necessity 
any more but for the sake of 
work itself. Still a man had 
to wonder . 

had begun to visit the 
Public Library Archives, 
poring over musty references 
that always led to maddening- 
ly frustrating dead ends. For 
the past century nothing real- 
ly informative seemed to have 
been written on the subject. 

“You must have government 
authorization,” the librarian 
explained when he asked for 
older references. Which, nat- 
urally, made him add a little 
suspicion to his already large 
dose of wonder. 

"You’re tampering with 
something dangerous,” Marie 
warned. “It would make more 
sense for you to take long- 
sleep pills until the work cycle 
picks up.” 

“I will get to see those early 
references.” he said through 
clenched teeth. 

He did.

ALBERT TEICHNER 




All he had needed to say at 
the library was that his worfc 
in sociology required investi- 
gation of some twentieth cen- 
tury files. The librarian, a tall, 
gaunt man, had given him a 
speculative glance. “Of course, 
you don’t have government 
clearance . But we get so 
few inquiries in sociology that 
I'm willing to offer a little 
encouragement.” He sighed. 
“Don’t get many inquiries al- 
together. Most people just 
can't stand reading. You might 
be interested to know this — 
one of the best headings to 
research in sociology is Con- 
spicuous consumption .” 

Then it was Wendell’s turn 
to glance speculatively. The 
older man, around a healthy 
hundred and twenty-five, had 
a look of earnest dedication 
about him that commanded re- 
spect as well as confidence. 

“Conspicuous consumption? 
An odd combination of words. 
Never heard of that before. 
I will look it up.” 

The librarian was nervous 
as he led his visitor into a 
reference booth. “That’s about 
all the help I can offer. If any- 
thing comes up, just ring for 
me. Burnett’s the name. Uh — 
you won’t mention I put you 
on the file without authoriza- 
tion, I hope.” 

“Certainly not.” 

As soon as he was alone he 
typed Conspicuous consump- 
tion into the query machine. 

It started grinding out long 
bibliographical sheets as well 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



as cross-references to Obsoles- 
cence, Natural; Obsolescence, 
Technological; Obsolescence, 
Planned, plus even odder items 
such as Waste-making, Art of 
and Production, Stimulated 
velocity of. How did such dis- 
parate subjects tie in with 
each other? 

B Y the end of the afternoon 
he began to see, if only 
dimly, to what the unending 
stream of words on the view- 
er pointed. 

For centuries ruling classes 
had made a habit of conspicu- 
ously wasting goods and ser- 
vices that were necessities for 
the mass of men. It was the 
final and highest symbol of 
social power. By the time of 
Louis XIV the phenomenon 
had reached its first peak. The 
second came in the twentieth 
century when mass production 
permitted millions to devote 
their lives to the acquisition 
and waste of non-essentials. 
Hart’s twenty-second century 
sensibilities were repelled by, 
the examples given. He shud- 
dered at the thought of such 
anti-social behavior. 

But a parallel development 
was more appealingly positive 
in its implications. As the 
technological revolution 
speeded up, devices were su- 
perseded as soon as produced. 
The whole last half of the 
1900’s was filled with in- 
stances where the drawing 
board kept outstripping the 
assembly line. 

Ill 




Hart remembered this last 
change from early school days 
but the later, final develop- 
ment was completely new and 
shocking to him. Advertising 
had pressured more and more 
people to replace goods before 
they wore out with other 
goods that were, essentially, 
no improvement on their pred- 
ecessors! Eventually just the 
word “NEW” was enough to 
trigger buying panics. 

There had been growing 
awareness of what was hap- 
pening, even sporadic resis- 
tance to it by such varied 
ideologies as Conservative 
Thrift, Asocial Beatnikism 
and Radical Inquiry. But, 
strangely enough, very few 
people had cared. Indeed, any- 
thing that diminished con- 
sumption was viewed as dan- 
gerously subversive. 

“And rightly so!” was his 
first, instinctive reaction. His 
second, reasoned one, though, 
was less certain. 

The contradiction started to 
give him a headache. He hur- 
ried from the scanning room, 
overtaxed eyes blinking at the 
rediscovery of daylight. 

Burnett walked him to the 
door. “Not feeling well?” he 
inquired. 

“I’ll be all right. I just need 
a few days real work.” He 
stopped. “No, that's not why. 
Tm confused. I’ve been read- 
ing crazy things about obso- 
lescence. They used to have 
strange reasons for it. Why, 
some people even said replace- 

112 



ments were not always im- 
provements and were unnec- 
essary !” 

Burnett could not complete- 
ly hide his pleasure. “You’ve 
been getting into rather deep 
stuff.” 

“Deep — or nonsensical!” 
“True. True. Come back to- 
morrow and read some more.” 
“Maybe I will.” But he was 
happy to get away from the 
library building. 

Marie was horrified when 
he told her that evening about 
his studies. “Don’t go back 
there,” she pleaded. “It’s dan- 
gerous. It’s subversive! How 
could people say such awful 
things? You remember that 
Mr. Johnson around the cor- 
ner? He seemed such a nice 
man, too, until they arrested 
him without giving a reason 
. and how messed up he was 
when he got out last year. 
I’ll bet that kind of talk ex- 
plains the whole thing. It’s 
crazy. Everyone knows items 
start wearing out and they 
have to be replaced.” 

“I realise that, honey, but 
it’s interesting to speculate. 
Don’t we have guaranteed 
freedom of thought?” 

She threw up her hands as 
if dealing with a child. “Nat- 
urally we have freedom of 
thought. But you should have 
the right thoughts, shouldn’t 
you? Wendell, promise me you 
won’t go back to that library.” 
“Well — ” 

“Reading’s a very risky 
thing anyway.” Her eyes were 



ALBERT TEICHNER 




saucer-round with fright. 
“Please, darling. Promise.” 
“Sure, you’re right, honey. 
I promise.” 

H E meant it when he said 
it. But that night, toss- 
ing from side to side, he felt 
less certain. In the morning, 
as he went out, Marie asked 
him where he was going. 

“I want to observe the prep- 
arations for the Preliminary 
Rites.” 

“Now that,” she grinned, 
“is what I call healthy think- 
ing.” 

For a while he did stand 
around the Central Plaza 
along with thousands of other 
idlers, watching the robot 
dump trucks assemble the 
piles of discarded equipment. 
The crowd cheered loudly as 
an enormous crane was knock- 
ed over on its side. 

“There’s fifty millions worth 
out there!” a bystander ex- 
ulted. “It’s going to be the 
biggest Preliminary I’ve ever 
seen.” 

“It certainly will be!” he 
said, catching a little of the 
other man’s enthusiasm de- 
spite his previous doubts. 

Preliminary Rites were part 
of the emotion-stoking that 
preceded the Highest Holy 
Day. Each Rite was greater 
and more destructive than 
those that had gone before. 
As tokens of happy loyalty, 
viewers threw hats and 
watches and stickpins onto 
the pile just prior to the entry 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



of the slaggers. What better 
way could be found for each 
man to manifest his common 
humanity? 

After a while doubt started 
assailing him again, and Hart 
found himself returning al- 
most against his will to the 
Library Building. Burnett 
greeted him cordially. “To- 
day’s visit is completely le- 
gal,” he said. “Anyone doing 
olden time research is auto- 
matically authorized if he has 
been here before.” 

“I hope my thought can be 
as legal,” Hart blurted out. 
“Well — that was just a joke.” 
“Oh, I can recognize a joke 
when I hear one, my friend.” 
Hart went to his booth, feel- 
ing the man’s eyes measuring 
him more intently than ever. 
It was almost a welcome re- 
lief to start reading the ref- 
erence scanner once more. 

But not for long. As the 
wider pattern unfolded, his 
anxiety state intensified. 

It was becoming perfectly 
obvious that many, many re- 
placements used to be made 
long before they were needed. 
And it was still true. I should 
not be thinking such thoughts, 
he told himself, I should be 
outside in the Plaza, being 
normal and human. 

But he could see how it had 
come about, step by step. First 
there had been pressure from 
the ruling echelons, many of 
whose members only main- 
tained their status through 
excessive production. Then, 

113 




much more important, there 
had been the willful blindness 
of the masses who wanted to 
keep their cozy, familiar tread- 
mills going. 

He slammed down the off 
button and went out to the 
librarian’s desk. “Do people 
want to work all the time,’’ he 
said, “for the sake of work 
alone?" 

He immediately regretted 
the question. But Burnett did 
not seem to mind. '“You’ve 
only stated the positive rea- 
son, Mr. Hart. The negative 
one could be stronger — the 
fear of what they would have 
to do if they did not have to 
work much over a long peri- 
od.” 

"What would it mean?” 

“Why, they would have to 
start thinking! Most people 
don’t mind thought if it’s con- 
centrated in a narrow range. 
But if they have to think in a 
broad range to keep boredom 
away — no, that’s too high a 
price for most of them! They 
avoid it when they can. And 
under present circumstances 
they can.” He stopped. “Of 
course that’s a purely hypo- 
thetical fiction I’m construct- 
ing.” 

Hart shook his head. “It 
sounds awfully real to be 
purely — ” He, too caught him- 
self up. “Of course, you’re 
only positing a fiction.” 

Burnett started putting his 
desk papers away. “I’m leav- 
ing now. The Preliminary be- 
gins soon. Want to come?” 

114 



The man’s face was stolidly 
blank except for his brown 
eyes which burned like a zea- 
lot’s. Fascinated by them, 
Hart agreed. It would be best 
to return anyway. Some of 
the bystanders had looked too 
curiously at him when he had 
left. Who would willingly leave 
a Rite when it was approach- 
ing its climax? 

II 

T HE Plaza was now throng- 
ed and the sacrificial pile 
towered over a hundred feet 
in the cleared center area. 
Then, as the first collective 
Ah! arose, a giant slagger 
lumbered in from the east, the 
direction prescribed for such 
commencements. Long polar- 
ity arms glided smoothly out 
of the central mechanism and 
reached the length for Total 
Destruction. 

“That’s the automatic set- 
ting,” parents explained to 
their children. 

“When?” the children de- 
manded eagerly. 

“Any moment now.” 

Then the unforeseen oc- 
curred. 

There was a rumbling from 
inside the pile and a huge 
jagged patchwork of metal 
shot out, smashing both arms. 
The slagger teetered, swaying 
more and more violently from 
side to side until it collapsed 
on its side. The rumbling 
grew. And then the pile, like 
a mechanical cancer, ripped 

ALBERT TEICHNER 




the stagger apart and then 
absorbed it. 

The panicking crowd fell 
back. Somewhere a child be- 
gan crying, provoking more 
hubbub. “Sabotage!” people 
were crying. “Let’s get away !” 

Nothing like this had ever 
happened before. But Hart 
knew instantly what had caus- 
ed it. Some high-level servo 
mechanisms had not been 
thoroughly disconnected. They 
had repaired their damages, 
then imposed their patterns 
on the material at hand. 

A second slagger came rush- 
ing into the square. It dis- 
charged immediately ; and the 
pile finally collapsed and dis- 
integrated as it was supposed 
to. 

The crowd was too shocked 
to feel the triumph it had 
come for, but Hart could not 
share their horror. Burnett 
eyed him. “Better look indig- 
nant,” he said. “They’ll be out 
for blood. Somebody must 
have sabotaged the setup." 

“Catch the culprits !” he 
shouted, joining the crowd 
around hint. “Stop anti-social 
acts !” 

“Stop anti-social acts!” 
roared Burnett ; and, in a 
whisper : “Hart, let’s get out 
of here.” 

As they pushed their way 
through tile milling crowd, a 
loudspeaker boomed out : “Re- 
turn home in peace. The in- 
stincts of the people are good. 
Healthy destruction forever! 
The criminals will be tracked 



down ... if they exist.” 

“A terrible thing, friend,” 
a woman said to them. 

“Terrible, friend,” Burnett 
agreed. “Smash the anti-social 
elements without mercy!” 
Three children were cluster- 
ed together, crying. “I wanted 
to set the right example for 
them,” said the father to any- 
one who would listen. “They'll 
never get over this!” 

Hart tried to console them. 
“Next week is High Holy 
Day,” he said, but the bawling 
onlv increased. 

The two men finally reached 
a side avenue where the crowd 
was thinner. “Come with me,” 
Burnett ordered, “I want you 
to meet some people.” 

H E sounded as if he were 
instituting military disci- 
pline but Hart, still dazed, 
willingly followed. “It wasn’t 
such a terrible thing,” he said, 
listening to the distant up- 
roar. “Why don’t they shut 
up!” 

“They will — eventually.” 
Burnett marched straight a- 
head and looked fixedly in the 
same direction. 

“The thing could have gob- 
bled up the city if there hadn’t 
been a second slagger!” said 
a lone passerby. 

“Nonsense,” Burnett mut- 
tered under his breath. “You 
know that, Hart. Any self- 
regulating mechanism reaches 
a check limit sooner than 
that.” 

“It has to.” 



THE JUNKMAKERS 



115 




They turned into a large 
building and went up to the 
fiftieth floor. “My apartment,” 
said Burnett as he opened the 
door. 

There were about fifteen 
people in the large living 
room. They rose, smiling, to 
greet their host. “Let’s save 
the self - congratulations for 
later,” snapped Burnett. 
“These were merely our own 
preliminaries. We're not out 
of the woods yet. This, ladies 
and gentlemen, is our newest 
recruit. He has seen the light. 
I have fed him basic data and 
I’m sure we’re not making a 
mistake with him.” 

Hart was about to demand 
what was going on when a 
short man with eyes as in- 
tense as Burnett’s proposed a 
toast to “the fiasco in the 
Plaza.” Everyone joined in 
and he did not have to ask. 

“Burnett, I don’t quite un- 
derstand why I am here but 
aren’t you taking a chance 
with me?” 

“Not at all. I've followed 
your reactions since your first 
visit to the library. Others 
here have also — when you 
were completely unaware of 
being observed. The gradual 
shift in viewpoint is familiar 
to us. We’ve all been through 
it. The really important point 
is that you no longer like the 
kind of world into which you 
were born.” 

“That’s true, but no one can 
change it.” 

“We are changing it, said 



a thin-faced young woman. 
“I work in a servo lab and — 
“Miss Wright, time enough 
for that later,” interrupted 
Burnett. “What we must know 
now, Mr. Hart, is how much 
you’re willing to do for your 
new-found convictions? It will 
be more work than you've ever 
dreamed possible.” 

He felt as exhilarated as he 
did in the months after High 
Holy Day. “I’m down to under 
ten hours labor a week. I’d do 
anything for your group if I 
could get more work.” 
Burnett gave him a hearty 
handshake of congratulation 
. but was frowning as he 
did so. “You’re doing the right 
thing — for the wrong reason. 
Every member of this group 
could tell you why. Miss 
Wright, since you feel like 
talking, explain the matter.” 
“Certainly. Mr. Hart, we 
are eng ged in an activity of 
so-called subversion for a pos- 
itive reason, not merely to 
avoid insufficient work load. 
Your reason shows you are 
still being moved by the values 
that you despise. We want to 
cut the work-production load 
on people. ' We want them to 
face the problem of leisure, 
not flee it.” 

“There’s a heart-warming 
paradox here,” Burnett ex- 
plained. “Every excess even- 
tually undermines itself. 
Everybody in the movement 
starts by wanting to act for 
their beliefs because work ap- 
pears so attractive for its own 

ALBERT TEICHNER 



116 




sake. I was that way, too, un- 
til I studied the dead art of 
philosophy.” 

“Well — ” Hart sat down, 
deeply troubled. “Look, I de- 
plore destroying equipment 
that is still perfectly useful 
as much as any of you do. But 
there is a problem. If the de- 
struction were stopped there 
would be so much leisure peo- 
ple would rot from boredom.” 

B URNETT pounced eagerly 
on the argument. “Instead 
they’re rotting from artificial 
work. Boredom is a tempo- 
rary, if recurring phenome- 
non of living, not a permanent 
one. If most men face the dif- 
ficulty of empty time long 
enough they find new prob- 
lems with which to fill that 
time. That’s where philosophy 
showed me the way. None of 
its fundamental mysteries can 
ever be solved but, as you pit 
yourself against them, your 
experience and capacity for 
being alive grows.” 

“Very nice,” Hart grinned, 
"wanting all men to be phi- 
losophers. They never have 
been.” 

“You shouldn’t have 
brought him here,’ growled 
the short man. “He’s not one 
of us. Now we have a real 
mess.” 

. “Johnson, I’m leader of this 
group!” Burnett exploded. 
“Credit me with a little un- 
derstanding. All right, Hart, 
what you say is true. But 
why? Because most men have 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



always worked too hard to 
achieve the fruits of curios- 
ity.” 

“I hate to keep being a 
spoil-sport, but what does that 
prove? Some men who had to 
work as hard as the rest have 
been interested in things be- 
yond the end of their nose.” 

They all groaned their dis- 
approval. 

“A good point, Hart, but it 
doesn’t prove what you think. 
It just shows that a minority 
enjoy innate capacities and 
environmental variations that 
make the transition to phi- 
losopher easier.” 

“And you haven’t proven 
anything about the incurious 
majority.” 

“This does, though: when- 
ever there was a favorable 
period the majority who could, 
as you put it, see beyond the 
ends of their noses increased. 
Our era is just the opposite. 
We are trapped in a vicious 
circle. Those noses are usu- 
ally so close to the grindstone 
that men are afraid to raise 
their heads. We are breaking 
that circle!” 

“It’s a terribly important 
thing to aim for, Burnett, but 
— ” He brought up another 
doubt and somebody else an- 
swered it immediately. 

For the next half hour, as 
one uncertainty was expressed 
after another, everybody join- 
ed in the answers until in- 
exorable logic forced his sur- 
render. 

“All right,” he conceded, “I 

117 




will do anything I can — not 
to make work for myself, but 
to help mankind rise above 
it." 

'C'XCEPT for a brief, trium- 
■Ijphant glance in Johnson’s 
direction, Burnett gave no 
further attention to what had 
happened and plunged imme- 
diately into practical matters. 

To halt the blind worship of 
work, the Rites had first to be 
discredited. And to discredit 
the Rites, the awe inspired by 
their infallihle performance 
had to be weakened. The sab- 
otage of the Preliminary had 
been the first local step in that 
direction. There had been a 
few similar, if smaller, epi- 
sodes, executed by other 
groups, but they had received 
as little publicity as possible. 

“Johnson, you pulled one so 
big this time that they can’t 
hide it. Twenty thousand wit- 
nesses ! When it come3 to get- 
ting things done you're the 
best we have!" 

The little man grinned. "But 
you're the one who knows how 
to pick recruits and organize 
our concepts. This is how it 
worked. I re-fed the emptied 
cryotron memory box of a ro- 
bot discard with patterns to 
deal with anything it was like- 
ly to encounter in a destruc- 
tion pile. I kept the absolute- 
freeze mechanism in working 
order, but developed a shield 
that would hide its activity 
from the best pile detector.” 
He spread a large tissue sche- 

118 



matic out on the floor and they 
all gathered around it to study 
the details. “Now, the impor- 
tant thing was to have an ex- 
ternal element that could re- 
sume contact with a wider cir- 
cuit, which could in turn start 
meshing with the whole robot 
mechanism and then through 
that mechanism into the pile. 
This little lever made the con- 
tact at a pre-fed time.” 

Miss Wright was enthusias- 
tic. “That contact is half the 
size of any I’ve been able to 
make. It’s crucially import- 
ant,” she added to Hart. “A 
large contact can look sus- 
picious.” 

While others took minipho- 
tos of the schematic. Hart 
studied the contact carefully. 
“I think I can reduce its size 
by another fifty per cent. Al- 
loys are one of my specialties 
— when I get a chance to 
work at them.” 

“That would be ideal,” said 
Burnett. “Then we could set 
up many more discarded ro- 
bots without risk. How long 
will it take?” 

“I can rough It out right 
now.” He scribbled down the 
necessary formulas and every- 
one photographed that too. 

“Maximum security is now 
in effect,” announced Burnett. 
“You will destroy your copies 
as soon as you have trans- 
ferred them to edible base 
copies. At the first hint of 
danger you will consume 
them. Use home enlargers for 
study. In no case are you to 

ALBERT TEICHNER 




make permanent blowups that 
would be difficult to destroy 
quickly.” He considered them 
sternly. “Remember, you are 
running a great risk. You’re 
not only opposing the will of 
the state but the present will 
of the vast majority of citi- 
zens.” 

“If there are as many other 
underground groups as you 
indicate,” said Hart, “they 
should have this information.” 
“We get it to them,” an- 
swered Burnett. “I’m going 
on health leave from my job.” 
“And what will be your ex- 
cuse?” Wright demanded an- 
xiously. 

“Nervous shock,” smiled 
their leader. “After all, I did 
see today’s events in the 
Plaza.” 

W HEN Hart reached home 
his wife was waiting for 
him. “Why did you take so 
long, Wendell. I was worried 
sick. The radio says anti-so- 
cials are turning wild servos 
loose. How could human be- 
ings do such a thing?” 

“I was there. I saw it all 
happen.” He frowned. “The 
crowd was so dense I couldn’t 
get away.” 

“But what happened? The 
ways the news was broadcast 
I couldn’t understand any- 
thing.” 

He described the situation 
in great detail and awaited 
Marie's reaction. It was even 
more encouraging than he had 
hoped for. “I understand less 

120 



than before! How could any- 
thing reactivate that rubble? 
They put everything over five 
years old into the piles, and 
the stuff’s supposed to be de- 
crepit already. You'd almost 
think we were destroying 
wealth before its time, because 
if those disabled mechanisms 
reactivate — ” She came to a 
dead halt. “That’s madness! 
Oh, I wish High Holy Day 
were here already so I could 
get back to work and stop this 
empty thinking /” 

Her honest face was more 
painfully distorted than he 
had ever seen it before, even 
during the universal pre-Rite 
doldrums. “Only a few more 
days to go," he consoled. 
“Don’t worry, honey. Every- 
thing’s going to be all right. 
Now I’d like to be alone in 
the study for a while. I've 
been through an exhausting 
time.” 

“Aren’t you going to eat?” 

The last word triggered the 
entry of Eric, the domestic 
robot, pushing the dinner cart 
ahead of him. “No food to- 
night," Hart insisted. The 
shining metal head nodded its 
assent and the cart was wheel- 
ed out. 

“That’s not a very humane 
thing to do,” she scolded. 
“Eric’s not going to be serv- 
ing many more meals — ” 

“Good grief, Marie, just 
leave me alone for a while, 
will you?” He slammed the 
study door shut, warning him- 
self to display less nervous- 

ALBERT TEICHNER 




ness in the future as he lis- 
tened to her pacing outside. 
Then she went away. 

The projector gave him a 
good-sized wall image to con- 
sider. He spent most of the 
night calculating where he 
could place tiny self-activators 
in the “obsolescent” robots 
that were to be donated by 
his plant. Then he set up the 
instruction tapes to make the 
miniature contacts. Produc- 
tion then would be a simple 
job, only taking a few min- 
utes, and during a working 
day there were always many 
periods longer than that when 
he was alone on the produc- 
tion floor. 

But thinking the matter out 
without computers was much 
more difficult. Human beings 
ordinarily filled their time on 
a lower abstracting level. 

When he unlocked the study 
door in the morning he was 
startled to see Marie bustling 
down the corridor, pushing 
the food service cart herself. 
That did not make sense, espe- 
cially considering last night’s 
statement about Eric. 

“I thought you’d want 
breakfast early,” she coughed. 

“You didn’t have to bother, 
honey. Eric could have done 
it.” 

If she had been prying, the 
cart might have been a prop 
to take up as soon as he came 
out. On the other hand, what 
could she in her technical ig- 
norance make of such mat- 
ters anyway? 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



It was best not to rouse any 
deeper suspicions by openly 
noticing her wifely iiosiness. 
At breakfast they pretended 
nothing had happened, devot- 
ing the time to mutually dis- 
approved cousins, but all day 
long he kept wondering wheth 
long he kept wondering 
whether ignorant knowledge 
couldn’t be as dangerous as 
the knowing kind. 

T HE next morning, after a 
long sleep, he went to the 
factory for the first of his 
semi-weekly work periods. 

He sat before a huge con- 
sole, surveying scores of dials, 
at the end of a machine that 
was over five hundred yards 
long. Today it was turning out 
glass paper the color of wat- 
ered blood, made only for Rit- 
ual publications, packing it in 
sheets and dispatching them 
in automatic trucks; but the 
machine could be adjusted to 
everything from metal sheet- 
ing to plastic felts. At the far 
end sat another man, dimin- 
ished by distance, busily tend- 
ing more dials that could real- 
ly take care of themselves. 

After a while the man went 
out for a break. Hart ran a 
hundred yards to a section 
that was not working. He 
snapped it into the alloy sup- 
ply and fed in the tape. In a 
minute, several dozen tiny 
contacts came down a chute. 
He pocketed them and discon- 
nected the section just before 
his fellow worker reappeared. 

121 




The man walked down the 
floor to him, looking curious. 

“Anything the matter?” he 
asked, hopeful for some break 
in routine. 

“No, just felt like a walk.” 

“Know what you mean — I 
feel restless too. Too bad this 
plant’s only two years old. 
Boy, wouldn’t she make a 
great disintegration!” He 
grinned, slapping a fender 
affectionately. 

Hart joined in the joke. 
“Gives us something to look 
forward to in ten years.” 

“A good way to look at 
things,” said the other man. 

At home he locked the con- 
tacts in a desk drawer. To- 
morrow he would deliver most 
of them to Burnett’s apart- 
ment. 

But the next morning an 
emergency letter came from 
his group leader, warning him 
not to appear there. I am go- 
ing completely underground. 
I think they may suspect my 
activities. The dispersion plan 
must go into effect. You know 
how to reach Johnson and 
Wright and they each in turn 
can get to two others. Good 
luck! 

He had just put the letter 
in his pocket when Eric an- 
nounced the arrival of a Ritu- 
als Inspector. 

The man had nervous close- 
set eyes and seemed embar- 
rassed by his need to make 
such a visit. Hart took the 
offensive as his best defense. 
“I don’t understand this, In- 

122 



spector,” he protested. “You 
people should be busy with 
High Holy preparations. Are 
you losing your taste for 
work?” 

“Now, now, Mr. Hart, that's 
a very unkind remark. I dis- 
like this nonsense as much 
as anyone.” His square jaw 
chewed into each word as he 
opened his scanning box. “It’s 
the anti-social sabotage.” 

“Do you mean to say I am 
under suspicion?” Marie was 
now loitering in the doorway, 
worse luck. 

“Oh, no. Nothing so insult- 
ing. This is strictly imper- 
sonal. The Scanning Center 
has picked apartments at com- 
plete random and we’re to 
make spot checks.” 

The eye at one end of the 
box blinked wickedly, waiting 
for an information feed. 
“Now, sir, if you'll pardon 
me, I’ll just take the records 
from one of those desk draw- 
ers — any drawer — and put 
them in the box.” Hart slid 
open a drawer. “No, sir, I 
think I’ll try the next one. It’s 
regulation not to accept sug- 
gestions.” 

With a hand made deft by 
practise he scooped out all the 
sheets and tapes and put them 
in the box. The scanner’s fin- 
gers rapidly sorted them past 
the eye. Hart exhaled, reliev- 
ed that an innocuous drawer 
had been selected, and the in- 
spector handed back the ma- 
terial to him. “Well, Inspector, 
that’s that.” 



ALBERT TEICHNER 




“Not quite.” The Inspector 
selected another drawer at the 
other end of the desk and 
dumped everything before the 
scanner. His examination was 
speeding up and that was not 
good; he would have time to 
take more sample readings. 

“Now if you’ll empty your 
left pocket — ” 

H, this is too much!” 
Vr Marie exploded. “My 
husband struggles all night 
on secret work, studying to 
find ways to stop the anti- 
socials, and you treat him like 
one of them!” 

“You’re working on the 
problem?” the Inspector said 
respectfully. “What are you 
doing?” 

Frying pan to fire. Hart 
preferred the pan and pulled 
open a drawer. “It’s too com- 
plicated, too much time need- 
ed to explain!” 

The Inspector glanced at his 
watch. “I’m falling behind 
schedule.” He closed up his 
box. “Sorry, but I have to 
leave. Heavy time sheet to- 
day.” 

As soon as he was gone, 
Hart breathed easier. Nothing 
incriminating would be fed 
into the Central Scanner. 

Marie became apologetic. 
"I'm sorry I said it, Wendell, 
but I couldn’t keep quiet. All 
I did last night was peek in 
once or twice.” 

He shrugged. “I’m just on 
a minor project.” 

“Every bit counts.” She 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



shook her head. “Only you 
have to wonder — I mean, 
don’t think I’m treasoning, 
but while I was shopping an 
hour ago a lot of women said 
you have to think — how come 
all that obsolescent junk could 
work so well, after being thor- 
oughly wrecked, too? You al- 
most wonder whether some of 
it was too good for disinte- 
gration.” 

Wendell pretended to be 
shocked. “Just a fluke of cir- 
cumstance. If something like 
that happened again you'd be 
right to wonder. But it could 
not ever happen again.” 

“Don’t get me wrong, Wen- 
dell. None of the women at- 
tacked anything. It was more 
like what you just said. They 
said if it happened again, then 
you’d have to wonder. But of 
course it couldn’t happen 
again.” 

How well the tables had 
turned! Not only had Marie’s 
ignorant knowledge proven 
helpful but she had now given 
him a positive idea also. 

When he met Wright and 
Johnson at the latter’s apart- 
ment that evening he explain- 
ed it to them. “We can propa- 
gate ‘dangerous’ thoughts and 
yet appear completely loyal. 
We can set up the reaction to 
next High Holy Day.” 

“How?” demanded Johnson. 
“That’s having your cake and 
eating it.” 

“Nothing’s impossible in the 
human mind,” Wright said. 
“Let's listen.” 

123 




“Here's the point. Wher- 
ever you go there will be peo- 
ple tsk-tsking about the Pre- 
liminary fiasco. Just reassure 
them, say it meant nothing at 
all by itself. If it ever hap- 
pened again, then there would 
be room for doubt but, of 
course, it could not happen 
again!” 

Wright smiled. “That's al- 
most feminine in its subtlety." 

He smiled back. “My wife 
inspired it. Don’t get nervous 
— it was unconscious, sheerly 
by acident." 

“Whatever the cause, it’s 
the perfect result,” Johnson 
conceded. “We’ll spread it 
through the net.” 

“Along with this, I hope.” 
Wendell dumped the contacts 
on a table top. “It’s the small- 
est size possible. A lot should 
get by unnoticed. Find cell 
members who can set up cry- 
otrons with a wide range of 
instructions to cope with any- 
thing in the piles. Some weird- 
ly alive concoctions of ‘ob- 
solescent’ parts ought to re- 
sult.” 

“Some day the world’s go- 
ing to know what you’ve done 
for it,” said Johnson solemnly. 

“That could happen too 
soon!” Miss Wright’s face, 
honest and open in its horse- 
like length, broke into a wide 
grin. 

“Amen,” said Hart, adding 
the private hope that Marie, 
blessed with superior looks, 
might be able to show as much 
superior wisdom some day. 

124 



T HE hope was not immedi- 
ately fulfilled. When he 
reached home Marie was in a 
tizzy of excitement. “You’re 
just in time, darling. They just 
caught three subversives. One 
of them was a woman,” she 
added as this were compound- 
ing an improbability with an 
impossibility. “They're going 
to show them.” 

He gripped his belt tightly. 
“A woman?” 

“That’s right. There she is 
now.” 

A uniformed officer was 
gently helping a pale little old 
woman sit down before the 
camera, as if she were more 
an object of pity than of fear. 
Hart relaxed. 

“ — caught red-handed with 
the incriminating papers,” 
shouted an offstage announc- 
er. “Handbills asserting ob- 
jects declared obsolescent 
could actually last indefinite- 
ly!” 

“What do you have to say 
for yourself?” the officer ask- 
ed gently. “You must realize, 
of course, that such irreligious 
behavior precludes your mov- 
ing in general society for a 
long time to come.” 

“I don’t know what came 
over me,” she sobbed -in a 
tired voice. “Curiosity. Yes, 
curiosity, that’s what it was. 
I saw these sheets of paper 
in the street and they said we 
should stop working so hard 
at compulsory tasks and start 
working to expand our own 
interests and personalities.” 

ALBERT TEICHNER 




“Self - contradictory non- 
sense!” said the voice. 

“Yes, I know that. But it 
made me curious and I took it 
home to read, and it said our 
compulsory tasks were artifi- 
cially manufactured and, if 
you didn’t believe that, look at 
the pile that reactivated itself 
the other day.” She stopped, 
reorganizing her thoughts. 
“Of course, though, that thing 
in the Plaza was unique, you 
know. I don't think it could 
mean a thing . unless it 
happened a few times. And 
the fact is it won’t ever hap- 
pen again.” 

“Well, that much makes 
very good sense,” said Marie. 
“You said the same thing, 
Wendell. I don't think that 
poor woman knew what she 
was doing — just a dupe for 
subversive propaganda.” 

“ — a dupe for subversive 
propaganda,” the announcer 
was saying. 

“See, exactly what I said.” 

“Yes. dear.” 

How swiftly the decentral- 
ized underground was work- 
ing! Hart could not tell wheth- 
er the old woman was an ac- 
tive member or just a passive 
responder, but it did not mat- 
ter. She was now spreading 
the seeds for future doubt 
across the land. 

Two old men were brought 
in and they mumbled the same 
disconnected story as their 
sister. 

“We have intensively in- 
terrogated these prisoners,” 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



boomed the announcer, “and 
know there is nothing more 
to the rumored anti-social plot 
than this stupid chatter. Re- 
main vigilant and you have 
nothing to fear!” 

“You are sentenced to five 
years isolation from general 
society,” said the officer, in a 
voice dulcet enough to sell ad- 
vance orders for replacement 
products that had not yet been 
made. “Our intention is to 
protect you from bad influ- 
ences. Our hope is that others 
will take your lesson to heart.” 
“God bless you,” said the 
woman and her brothers join- 
ed in effusive thanks. 

“Makes you proud to be a 
human being,” Marie said. 
“I was getting some stupid 
doubts myself, dear. I must 
admit it. But that’s all past. 
I can hardly wait for the 
Highest Holy Day.” 

“Neither can I,” sighed her 
husband. 

IV 

T HE next day at noon Eric 
came to him, functioning 
on the final set of servo in- 
structions that had been in- 
stalled in him at the factory 
of his birth eight years be- 
fore. He shook hands with the 
two of them and said: “Now 
I am prepared for death.” 
Marie was tearful. “I will 
miss you, Eric. If you were 
only under five years old your 
span could be extended.” 
“Everything that happens 

125 




is right,” Eric said impas- 
sively. 

He clambered on to the 
operation table, instinctively 
knowing which flat surface 
was for him, and, breaking all 
his major circuits, gave up the 
ghost that only man could re- 
store to him. 

Hart found his wife’s grief 
easy to bear. The day after 
tomorrow she would join in 
the general exultation of High 
Holy Day, with Eric well for- 
gotten. He methodically began 
smashing the surface of the 
limbs and torso; the greater 
the visible damage, the great- 
er the honor redounding to 
the sacrifice donor. “This will 
be our gift to the general 
pile,” he said. 

“I thought we could keep 
him for our garden sacrifice,” 
Marie protested meekly. “Most 
people do.” 

“But the other way is the 
greater sacrifice.” 

There was no reply, because 
she knew he spoke for the 
deeper, more moving custom. 
But suddenly he began to act 
depressed himself. “I know 
we say it every ten years, but 
Eric was really the best com- 
panion we ever had.” He ges- 
tured toward the table. “I 
want to sit here with him for 
a while — alone.” 

“That’s carrying things too 
far, Wendell. A little grief is 
proper — but this much is 
actually morbid.” 

“It’s all within my rights.” 
She tossed her head petu- 

126 



lantly. “Well, I’ve done my 
‘'are. I can’t stand any more. 
It makes a person think and 
get depressed. I don’t care 
what you’re going to do. I’m 
going out to enjoy a Prelimi- 
nary.” 

“Can’t blame you for that,” 
he nodded. 

When she had gone he start- 
ed to work on new instruction 
tapes for activating the servo- 
cryotron. Nothing could be 
surrendered to chance. Every 
possible circumstance in the 
pile had to be anticipated. 
There had to be instructions 
for action if Eric was crushed 
below fifty feet of metal, for 
assembling any kind of scram- 
bled wiring, for adapting all 
types of parts in its immedi- 
ate surroundings, for using 
these parts to absorb parts 
further away and for timing 
the operation to the start of 
the Highest Rite. 

Some tapes had been pre- 
pared earlier, so it was pos- 
sible to put everything in the 
cryotron box before Marie re- 
turned, as well as to attach 
the tiny contact that would 
reach out from the box until 
it reached its first external 
scrap of wire or metal. 

“You poor darling,” she 
pouted. “You missed the most 
wonderful thing ! They demol- 
ished a whole thirty-story 
building !” 

His blood, atavistically ef- 
fected, pulsed faster until his 
new creed came to grips with 
his old emotions. “They usu- 

ALBERT TEICHNER 




ally don’t bother with build- 
ings for the Rites.” 

“I know — that’s what was 
so wonderful! The State has 
decided to make this one the 
biggest Day of all time. We’ll 
have enough work to fill the 
whole ten years! Everybody 
was so happy.” 

“I'm sure they were.” He 
caught himself in mid-sar- 
casm and said, “I’m sorry I 
missed it.” 

“And I'm sorry I’ve been 
so selfishly self-centered.” She 
frowned. “I forgot about it, 
but there were people in the 
crowd boasting they had been 
assigned to fight anti-social 
movements. I had to boast 
back that my husband had 
been honored too.” 

He tensed. “Oh? What did 
they say to that?” 

“Frankly, they laughed.” 
“I should think so. The Cen- 
tral Scanner didn’t pick up 
anything except a lot of inef- 
fective propaganda. The sab- 
otage business was all hy- 
steria.” 

“That’s just what they said 
— the assignments were an 
empty honor.” She coldly con- 
sidered Eric. “I want to wreck 
him too.” 

“I’ve smashed the insides,” 
he said. “You’d better just 
work the surface.” 

“That’s all I want to do,” 
she answered, starting to 
scratch traditional marks all 
over the dead robot. It gave 
her a full afternoon of happy, 
busy labor. 

THE JUNKMAKERS 



T HE next day a large open 
truck came around and the 
street echoed to the appeal for 
contributions. Festival spirit 
was running high everywhere 
and when the neighborhood 
crowd saw the young robot 
porters carry Eric out there 
was a loud cheer of apprecia- 
tion. 

“My husband decided on 
a major contribution right 
away,” Marie announced to 
them. 

“It’s the least we could do,” 
he said modestly. 

Many onlookers, swept 
away by their example, rush- 
ed indoors to bring out addi- 
tional items of sacrifice. But 
only two others gave up their 
robots. The rest clung to them 
for private Holy Night cere- 
monies. Soon Eric disappeared 
under the renewed deluge of 
egg-beaters and washers. 

“The best collection I have 
seen today,” said the inspector 
accompanying the truck. “You 
people are to be congratulated 
for your exceptional patrio- 
tism.” 

“Destroy!” they shouted 
back joyously. "Make work!” 
At dawn the Central Plaza 
was already crowded and new 
hordes kept pouring in from 
outlying areas. Wendell and 
his wife had been among the 
first to arrive. They waited, 
impatient in their separate 
ways, on the borderline five 
hundred yards from the ten- 
story pyre. 

Martial music roared from 

127 




loudspeakers, interrupted by 
tiie mellifluous boom of a mer- 
chandising announcer: “New 
product! Better models! One 
hundred years of High Holy 
Days! New! New! NEW!” 
“Destroy !” came the return- 
ing shout. “Make work ! Work ! 
Work!” 

All the sounds echoed back 
and forth until baffled away 
by the open area across the 
Plaza, where one large struc- 
ture had already been destroy- 
ed. Three others were slated 
for collapse today. 

“The biggest Holy Day 
ever,” a restless old woman 
said to Marie. “I’ve seen all 
nine of them.” 

“Eric’s in there,” Marie 
chatted back, superficially sad, 
deeply happy. 

“Who?” 

“Our house robot.” 
“Imagine that! Did you 
hear that?” People gathered 
round them and cheered. The 
good-natured jostling contin- 
ued until someone said : “Five 
minutes to go!” 

Wendell checked his watch. 
Somewhere in the pile at least 
one element was coming to 
life, a metal arm reaching out 
for brother metal to engulf in 
its cybernetic sweep. 

“They’re coming!” A line 
of six shiny new slaggers 
came rumbling into the open 
with military precision. They 
moved along slowly, prolong- 
ing the pleasures of anticipa- 
tion, then broke rank, each 
seeking its assigned point 

128 



around the pile of appliances 
gathered for destruction. 

“The latest improved mod- 
els,” said the loudspeakers. 
“They will first perform fif- 
teen minutes of automatic ma- 
neuvers.” The military music 
resumed and each slagger 
turned, as if circling a coin, in 
clanking rhythm to it. 

“The three hundred and six- 
ty degree turn. Next, making 
a box on the Plaza floor . .” 
The voice stopped, appalled. 

A N avalanche of metal slid 
down one side of the pile 
and the crowd gasped. The 
downward movement viscous- 
ly slowed ; then the metal, sud- 
denly alive with the capacity 
to defy gravity, circled up- 
ward. Jagged limbs started 
flailing about. 

“Disintegrator attack!” 
screamed the loudspeakers. 
“Attack!” 

The maneuvers stopped. For 
one brief moment prior to 
changeover the Plaza was 
dead still, except for the deaf- 
ening rumble in the pile. The 
slaggers broke the spell, rush- 
ing full speed toward the pile, 
evaporator beams working. 

One by one they faltered 
and were sucked into the de- 
structive pyre. 

The crowd fell further back. 
The whole pile came alive like 
a mineral octupus. Then the 
squirming thing collapsed, ev-

ably broken and dead. Every- 
thing had been happening too

fast for any pronounced re- 
action to accompany it; but 
now the world went crazy. 

“Stand firm!” pleaded the 
loudspeakers. “We will get re- 
inforcements as soon as cele- 
brations are finished else- 
where.” 

A barrage of enormous boos 
came from the disintegrating 
mob. “Never again! Fakes! 
It's finished, done for!” 
“Stand firm!” 

But the breakup down side 
avenues continued. “I don’t 
understand,” Marie shudder- 
ed. “Everything’s crazy. We’ve 
been deceived, Wendell. Who’s 
been deceiving us?” 

“Nobody — unless it’s our- 
selves.” 

“I don't understand that 
either.” Saucer-eyed she 
watched a great clump of dis- 
gruntled people push past. “I 
have to think!” 

Suddenly, as they came 
around a corner, they were 
facing Burnett. 

Hart tried to disregard him 
but the group leader would 
have none of that. He rushed 
up to Hart. “Good to see a 
friendly face. Shocking devel- 
opments !” His face was grim, 
but tiny wrinkles at the cor- 
ners of his eyes betrayed an 
amusement that could only be 
discovered by those who look- 
ed for it. 

“Mr. Burnett,” he explained 
to Marie. “A librarian at the 
main building. Mr. Burnett, 
my wife Marie.” 

“I am most happy to meet

you, Mrs. Hart. Have you 
heard the latest?” 

“No, Mr. Burnett.” 

“The same tilings have been 
happening everywhere! They 
announced it on the radio and 
they’re saying it’s due to anti- 
social elements. Shocking!" 

She shook her head stub- 
bornly. “I don’t know what to 
think. Maybe we shouldn’t be 
shocked, maybe we should be. 
I just don’t know, Mr. Bur- 
nett. I came to enjoy myself 
and look how it’s ended.” She 
bravely held back a sob. “May- 
be we’d have been better off if 
we’ve never heard about High 
Holy Days!” 

Burnett looked about with 
feigned apprehension. “You 
have to be careful what you 
say. The government says 
there’s even talk — subver- 
sive handbills — about trying 
to rehabilitate some of the 
stuff in the piles.” 

“The government ought to 
keep quiet!” she exploded. 
“They said this couldn’t hap- 
pen. You can’t believe any- 
thing they say any more. The 
people decide and the govern- 
ment will have to listen, that's 
what I say! And I'm a pretty 
typical person, not one of your 
intellectual kind. No criticism 
of present company intended.” 
“None taken, Mrs. Hart. 
Our human future,” said Bur- 
nett, exchanging a grin with 
his aide, “remains, as it al- 
ways has really been. Inter- 
esting — to say the least!”

HUE AND CRY 



W ELL, here we are, month 
after month trying to do 
the best we can in the way 
of producing an IF you’ll like, 
and it’s sometimes like drop- 
ping words down a well. We 
know you’re out there because 
somebody buys all those mag- 
azines! But, specifically, who 
are you? 

One of you is Lawrence 
Crilly of Elizabeth, New Jer- 
sey, who writes: 

Is is too much to ask for a 
letter-col ? It'd convince the fans 
that you’re actually trying to 
please them — while capturing 
the attention of casual readers — 
and the promise of egoboo if 
their names appeared in print 
would compel a large number of 
readers to comment on the stor- 
ies, who normally do not — my- 
self included. You ought to give 
this serious consideration. 

We did. Sounds like a good 
deal . so . consider this 
the letter-col; and if it’s brief 
this time, it’s because we don’t 
have much more that we can 
publish. 

But you can remedy that! 
Just get down to your type- 
writers ! 

And while you’re writing, 
check us out on a couple of 
basic assumptions we’re mak- 
ing. For instance: 

Assumption Number One : 
There’s space in the science 



fiction field . somewhere be- 
tween the childish adventure 
and the Prophets of Doom . 
for a magazine that’ll give 
the reader stories to enjoy — 
as well as something to think 
about. 

We think, in other words, 
that although science-fiction 
has come a long way, there is 
still a lot that the long-time 
“Great Names” of science 
fiction have to give us. (For 
which reason we’re proud to 
welcome back, in near-future 
issues, the likes of Lester del 
Rey, E. E. “Skylark” Smith 
and a dozen more all-time 
favorites.) What we aim for 
in IF is all the color of the 
old days, and all the stimula- 
tion of the new. 

Assumption Number Two : 
The readers are entitled to a 
share in making the decisions. 
Accordingly, we’ll try to do 
what you want — asking only 
that you tell us what it is ! 

Assumption Number Three : 
That “progress” is sometimes 
spelled M-I-S-T-A-K-E. We’ll 
try to do what you want — 
but if we goof, tell us so! 

As a starter, next issue will 
have a slightly different for- 
mat — a more compact type 
and therefore, we hope, more 
story-content. We’ll be look- 
ing forward to knowing what 
you think of that — and every- 
thing else ! END
