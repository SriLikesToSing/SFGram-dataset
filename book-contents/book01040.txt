FREEDOM FROM EVERYTHING 



WW/ITHOUT doubt the most im- 
portant discovery ever made 
is in the hands of people who 
recognize only a fraction of its 
immense significance. It is not 
going too far to say that by broad- 
casting the discovery, this edi- 
torial may mark the end of all of 
mankind’s problems. 

Like every great formulation, 
the discovery looks simple: 

“If you know why you feel 
angry,” say psychoanalysts, “you 
don’t have to be angry” 

Simple on the surface, yes, but 
it may take centuries for every 
aspect to be explored and applied. 
Before we begin our preliminary 
extrapolation, however, let’s test 
its validity in its current usage. 

Assume you drive a car and 
someone has sides wiped you. You 
know that going into a rage is in- 
fantile behavior. So -you pull over 
and carefully scrutinize your emo- 
tions. You feel angry because 
some roadhog endangered several 
lives and caused a few hundred 
dollars’ worth of damage. Why? 
Because he’s filled with aggres- 
sions. Are they your problem or 
his? His, of course. Retaliation 



would be your aggressions — your 
problem, not his. Still angry? Cer- 
tainly not; having worked out the 
whole thing, you have no need to 
be angry. 

The formulation naturally ap- 
plies to all emotions: joy, despair, 
love, hate, fear and so forth. We 
could test each, but we’d only be 
confirming the soundness of the 
discovery. Nor should we waste 
time on the prospect of a world 
in which all emotions, once 
known, need not be expressed. 
Let’s concentrate instead on the 
astonishing practical extensions. 

If it’s true that knowing why 
you feel an emotion removes the 
need to express it — and you’ve 
seen that it is so — then not apply- 
ing the formula to all human func- 
tions is a refusal to face reality. 

Take not-eating. Stated in 
blunt terms, we eat because we 
think (have been conditiond to 
believe) we are hungry. Any 
number of people, knowing why 
they felt hungry, have been able 
to fast for (seemingly) incredibly 
long periods. 

True enough, some died and

Thera were pride and indignation In Mezzerow'* 
mission to Earth and yet a practical reason . 
but maybe he should have let bed enough alonel 



Loves Company 

By F. L. WALLACE 

illustrated by EMSH 



T HE OFFICIAL took their suited his fancy and smeared it 
passports, scanning the against the small square of 
immense variety of stamps plastic, 
he had to choose from. He select- “Marcus Mezzerow?” he asked, 
ed one with multicolored ink that glancing at the older man and 

back at the passport. His lips 
quivered with amusement at what 
was printed there. “There seems 
to be a mistake in the name of 
the planet,” he said. “It’s hard to 
believe they’d call it Messy Row.” 
“There is a mistake,” said Mar- 
cus heavily. “However, there’s 
nothing you can do about it It’s 
listed as Messy Row on the 
charts.” 

The official's face twitched and 
he bent over the other passport. 
He was slow in stamping it “Wil- 
bur Mezzerow?” he asked the 
young man. 

“That’s me,” said Wilbur. “Isn’t 
it a terrible thing to do? You’d 
almost think people on Earth 
can’t spell — or maybe they don’t 




MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY

listen. That’s why Pa and me are 
here.” 

“Wilbur, this man is not re- 
sponsible for our misfortune,” 
said Marcus. “Neither can he cor- 
rect it. Don’t bore him with our 
problems.” 

“Well, sure.” 

“Come on.” 

‘Welcome to Earth,” said the 
official as they walked away. He 
caught sight of a woman coming 
toward him and cringed inwardly 
before he recognized that she, too, 
had just arrived from one of the 
outer worlds. He could tell be- 
cause of the absence of the iden- 
tifying gleam in her eyes. On 
principle he’d stamp her passport 
with dull and dingy ink. 

W ILBUR scuffled along beside 
his father. He hadn’t at- 
tained his full growth, but he was 
as tall though not as heavy as 
Marcus. “Where are we going 
now?” he asked. “Get the name 
changed?” 

“Don’t gawk,” said Marcus, re- 
straining his own tendency to 
gaze around in bewilderment. 
Things had changed since his 
father had been here. “No, we’re 
not. It’s simple, but it may take 
longer than we think. We have 
to act as if Earth is an unfriendly 
planet.” 

“Hardly seems like a planet.” 
“It is. If you scratch deep 
enough under those buildings, 

8 



you’ll find soil and rock.” Even 
Marcus didn’t know how deep 
that scratch would have to be. 

“Seems hard to believe it was 
once like — uh — Mezzerow.” 
Wilbur was looking at the build- 
ings and pedestrians streaming 
past and the little flutter cars 
that filled the air. “Bet you can’t 
find any place to be alone in.” 

“More people are alone within 
ten miles of us than you have 
ever seen,” said Marcus. He 
stopped in front of a building and 
consulted a small notebook. The 
address agreed, but he looked in 
vain for a name. There wasn’t 
a name on any of the buildings. 
Nevertheless, this ought to be it. 
They’d been walking for miles 
and he had checked all the 
streets. He spoke to Wilbur and 
they went inside. 

It was a hotel. The Universe 
over, there is no mistaking a 
hotel for anything else. Continu- 
ous arrivals and departures stamp 
it with peculiar impermanency. 
A person might stay twenty 
years and yet seem as transient 
as the man still signing the 
registry. 

A clerk sauntered over to the 
Mezzerows. He was plump, but 
the shoulders of his jacket were 
obviously much broader than he 
was. “Looking for someone?” he 
inquired. 

“I’m looking for the Outer 
Hotel,” said Marcus. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




‘This is a hotel,” the clerk said, 
raising his shoulders and letting 
them fall. One shoulder didn’t 
come down, so he grasped the 
bottom of the sleeve and pulled 
it down. 

“What’s the name?” 

The clerk yawned. “Doesn’t 
have a name — just a number. 
No hotel has had a name for the 
last hundred years. Too many of 
them.” 

“My father stayed at the Outer 
Hotel fifty years ago, before he 
left to discover a new planet It 
was at this address.” 

The clerk, wary of his shoulder 
pads, shrugged sideways. It 
gave him a bent look v^hen one 
shoulder stayed back. “Maybe it 
wasn’t a hundred years ago,” he 
said to his fingernails. “Anyway, 
they don’t have names now.” 
“This must be the old Outer 
Hotel,” Marcus decided. “We’ll 
stay here.” 

The clerk’s aplomb was not as 
foolproof as he imagined. It 
slipped a trifle. “You want to stay 
here? I mean really?” 

“Why not?” growled Marcus. 
“You have room, don’t you? It 
seems like a decent place. I don’t 
have any other recommenda- 
tions.” 

“Certainly it’s decent and we 
have room. I thought you might 
be more comfortable elsewhere. 
I can recommend an exclusive 
men’s hotel to you.” 



“We are plain people and don’t 
want anything exclusive,” said 
Marcus. “Register us, please.” 

“I don’t do menial tasks,” said 
the clerk with an offended laugh. 
“I’m here for the sole purpose of 
imparting class to the hotel. Take 
your registry problems to the 
desk robot.” 

Wilbur looked curiously at the 
pudgy clerk as he walked away, 
smiling coyly at the passersby. 
“Pa, how can a man like him 
make this place seem classy?” 
“Son, I don’t know,” said Mar- 
cus heavily. “Earth has changed 
since your grandfather described 
it to me. I don’t propose to find 
out what’s the matter with it. 
We’ll just take care of our busi- 
ness and go home.” 

T HEY signed at the desk, giv- 
ing their baggage claim 
checks to the robot, who assured 
them that everything would be 
zipped straight to their room 
from the spaceport. 

In spite of Wilbur’s protests 
that, he wasn’t tired, that he was 
just getting used to walking again 
after being cramped in the ship, 
they went to their rooms to fresh- 
en up. Thus they missed the 
noontime exodus of workers from 
the buildings around them. 

Marcus had food sent up, but 
didn’t eat much, though initially 
he had been hungry. The lot 219 
steaks were excellent in appear- 



MEZZilOW LOVES COMPANY 



9 




ance, nicely seared and thick. In- 
side, they were gray and watery, 
with an offensive taste, obviously 
tank-grown. After a few bites, 
Marcus abandoned the meat and 
ate vegetables. These, though ill- 
flavored and artificially colored, 
he could eat without suspicion. 

Wilbur consumed everything 
before him, ending by looking 
hungrily at the steak on his 
father’s plate. Marcus hastily 
shoved the trays in the disposer 
slot. If he had time before he 
left Earth, he meant to find out 
what a “lot 219” steak was. He 
hoped it wasn’t what he thought. 

When they were ready, they 
dropped to the ground floor. The 
clerk who gave class to the hotel 
was nowhere in sight. They went 
out into the street and headed 
for the tall spire of Information 
Center. It was a landmark they 
couldn’t miss. Every human who 
thought of visiting Earth was 
familiar with it. If a question 
couldn’t be answered there, it was 
beyond the scope of human 
knowledge. 

There were many more women 
than men on the streets. Marcus 
noted it, but didn’t think it un- 
usual. He had heard that women 
had more free time in the middle 
of the day on planets that had 
been settled for a long time. He 
walked on with a long stride, 
oblivious to the feminine glances 
he and his son attracted. 

10 



At Information Center, he con- 
sulted the index at the entrance, 
jostled by people from thousands 
of planets who were doing the 
same. The red line on the floor 
led to the planet section, which 
was what he wanted. Keeping 
check on Wilbur, who showed a 
tendency to wander, he followed 
it to the end. 

The end was an immense room 
with innumerable small booths. 
Instinctively, Marcus distrusted 
booths; more than anything else, 
they resembled vertical coffins. 
Growling to Wilbur to stay close 
by, he went inside and closed the 
door. He inserted a coin and 
made the selection. 

A harried face appeared on the 
viewplate. “Does your question 
require a human answer?” 

“It certainly does,” said Mar- 
cus. “I didn’t come nine hundred 
and forty-seven light-years to be 
befuddled by a robot.” 

The harried face barked some- 
thing unintelligible in another di- 
rection and then turned back to 
Marcus. “Very well. Question?” 
“I want to request a change. 
My planet — ” 

“Planet? Change?” repeated 
the face. It disappeared and a 
finger took its place. The finger 
rifled rapidly down a vertical in- 
dex. It stopped and stabbed and 
the index popped open. “Go to 
building P-CAF.” The finger 
snatched a slip out of the open 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




space and dropped the slip in a 
slot. “Go to the platform at the 
rear of this building. Take any 
tube with P-CAF on it. Apply at 
that building for the change.” 
Marcus wasn’t surprised, but 
he felt annoyed. “Can’t you make 
the change here? I don’t like be- 
ing shoved around.” 

“We are not authorized to 
make changes. We are merely 
what our name implies; we have 
the information to direct you to 
the proper sources. The slip I 
gave you is a map of the general 
vicinity of the place you want. 
You can’t get lost.” 

“You gave me no map,” snap- 
ped Marcus. The voice didn’t an- 
swer him, though the finger still 
waved on the viewplate. He 
couldn’t argue very well with a 
finger. The plate burped and a 
slip dropped out of the slot below 
it. Only then did he release the 
lever, allowing the finger to 
vanish. 

M ARCUS studied the map. P- 
CAF (Planets; changes, ap- 
ply for) was between M-AVO 
(Marriages; alternate variations 
of) and M-AAD (Marriages; an- 
nulment and divorce). 

Hastily, he stuffed the map in 
his pocket as Wilbur pressed the 
door, trying to look at what he 
had in his hand. It was nothing 
for a growing boy to see. 

It wasn’t a good map, since it 

MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



didn’t show where the building 
was in relation to the rest of the 
city. The transportation tube 
would take him there, but he’d 
have to find his own way back. 

The tube that whisked them to 
P-CAF was occupied mainly by 
Outers, a circumstance that made 
the crowded uncomfortable trip 
more bearable. Marcus didn’t talk 
to the others — their interests 
were worlds apart — but he felt 
closer to them than to the strange, 
frantic people of Earth. 

P-CAF was neo-drive-in classic 
cal, a style once in vogue through- 
out the Universe. With Wilbur 
following, Marcus plunged in. It 
seemed strange that he had come 
nine hundred odd light-years for 
a matter that, once stated, would 
only take a few matters of some 
minor official’s time. And yet it 
was necessary. For years, he had 
been writing requests without re- 
sults. 

It was not as crowded as In- 
formation Center. The booths 
were wider and Marcus decided 
they both could squeeze in. It 
was a historic moment: Wilbur 
should be present. After several 
trials, they did get in together. 

The official who came to the 
plate was as relaxed as the other 
had been harried. “Planets; 
changes, apply for,” he said. He 
had perfected the art of raising 
one eyebrow. 

“That’s why we’re here,” said 

11 




Marcus, fumbling in his jacket 
He was jammed against Wilbur 
and couldn’t get his hand in his 
pocket. 

“Land masses reshaped, oceans 
installed, or climate recycled?” 
asked the official. 

“We don’t want the climate 
changed,” said Wilbur. ‘We’ve 
got lots of it — rain, hail, snow, 
hot weather. All in the same day 
— though not in the same place. 
It’s a big planet, nearly as big 
as Earth.” 

‘Wilbur, I’ll do the talking,” 
declared Marcus, still struggling 
to reach his pocket. 

“Yes, Pa. But we don’t want 
the continents reshaped. We like 
them as they are. And we’ve got 
enough oceans.” 

“Wilbur,” Marcus said sharply, 
pulling his hand free. He held up 
a tattered chart. 

“Are you sure you know what 
you do want?” asked the relaxed 
man with a yawn. 

“I’m coming to it,” said Mar- 
cus. “Fifty years ago, my father, 
Mathew Mezzerow, discovered a 
planet. Things being the way they 
were then, planet stealing and 
such, Captain Mezzerow didn’t 
come back and report it. He set- 
tled on it right there, securing 
for his heirs and descendants a 
proper share of the new world.” 

“What do you expect for that, 
a medal?” 

“He could have had a medal. 



Being practical, he preferred a 
part of the planet Since then, we 
have become a thriving com- 
munity. But we’re not growing as 
fast as we should. That’s why I’m 
here.” 

“You’ve come to the wrong 
place,” said the man. “P-EHF is 
what you want.” 

“Planets; economic help for? 
No, we don’t want that kind of 
aid. However, there is one insig- 
nificant mistake that has been 
hindering us. People don’t settle 
the way they should. You see, 
though Captain Mathew Mezze- 
row didn’t return to report his 
discovery in person, he did send 
in a routine claim. That’s where 
the mistake was made. Naturally 
he named the planet after him- 
self. Mezzerow. Mezz — uh — 
row. The second e is almost 
silent, hardly pronounced at all. 
But what do you think somebody 
— a robot, probably — called 
it?” 

“I can’t guess.” 

“Messy Row,” said Marcus. “It 
maligns a good man’s name. 
We’re stuck with it because some- 
body bobbled.” - 

66T ADMIT it isn’t pretty,” said 
the official with a cautious 
smile. “But I can’t see that it 
affects anything. One name is as 
good as another.” 

“That’s what you think,” Mar- 
cus retorted. “I can see how the 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




robot made the mistake and I’m 
not blaming it My father sent in 
a verbal tape report Mezzerow 
could sound a little like Messy 
Row. Anyway, it’s had a bad ef- 
fect on the settlers. Men come 
there because it sounds easy and 
relaxed, which it is, of course, to 
a point. But women avoid it 
They don’t like the sound of the 
name.” 

“Then it’s really women you’re 
concerned with,” said the official. 
A cold glazed stare had replaced 
his indifference. “In any event, 
you’ve come to the wrong place. 
We reconstruct planets. Names 
are out of our jurisdiction.” 

“It makes things bad when 
there aren’t enough women,” con- 
tinued Marcus. “Some men leave 
when they can’t find anyone to 
marry.” He crumpled the old 
chart in his hands. “It’s not mere- 
ly that, of course. Simple justice 
demands that a great man’s name 
be properly honored.” 

“You’ve come to the wrong 
place for justice,” said the offi- 
cial. “P-CAF doesn’t make this 
kind of an adjustment. Let’s see 
if I can’t refer you to someone 
else.” He rested his head on his 
hand. Then he straightened up, 
snapping his fingers. “Of course. 
If you want the name of a planet 
changed, you go to Astrogation; 
charts, errors, locations of.” 

“You do?” Marcus asked dubi- 
ously. Life on Mezzerow had not 

MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



prepared him for the complexities 
of governmental organization. 

“Certainly,” said the official, 
happy that he had solved the 
problem. “Don’t thank me. It’s 
what I’m here for. Go to A- 
CELO.” 

“Where is it?” 

The official frowned import- 
antly and turned to the great 
vertical file that Marcus was 
learning to associate with all de- 
partments of the government He 
stabbed his finger at a space, but 
nothing opened. “Seem to be all 
out of reference slips,” he said 
with a casual lack of surprise. 
“Come back tomorrow and I may 
have some. It’s quitting time 
now.” 

“Do I have to come back? A- 
CELO may be on the other side 
of the city from here.” 

“It may be,” said the official, 
reaching for his jacket. “If you 
don’t want to waste time, buy a 
map from an infolegger. It’ll be 
a day old, but chances are it 
should be accurate on most 
things.” The plate snapped off, 
leaving Marcus and his son star- 
ing at nothing. 

Marcus got up and left the 
booth. “What’s an infolegger?” 
asked Wilbur as he followed him. 

“They move things fast on 
Earth,” said Marcus tiredly. He 
hadn’t realized how wearing it 
could be to chase down the 
thread of responsibility in a gov- 

13 




emment that had many things to 
look after. “An infolegger doesn’t 
know any more about it than you 
do, but he’ll sell you information 
that you can ordinarily get free 
from the government.” 

“But who buys from him?” 
“Fools like me who get tired 
of running around. We’d better 
get back to the hotel.” 

“I wish we were on Messy — 
Mezzerow,” said Wilbur wistfully. 
“Ma would have dinner ready 
now.” 

“I keep forgetting your appe- 
tite. All right, we’ll eat as soon 
as we find a restaurant.” 

T HEY found one a block away. 

It was easy enough to walk 
there. It was stopping that was 
hard. Marcus made his way to 
the side of the street and hauled 
Wilbur in out of the stream of 
pedestrians. Inside there was one 
vacant table which they prompt- 
ly took, oblivious to the glares 
of those who were not so fast 
afoot. 

Marcus studied the menu at 
length. To his disappointment, 
there was no lot 219 steak listed. 
Instead there were two other 
choices, a lot 313 and a miscel- 
lany steak. Marcus looked up to 
see that his son had already 
dialed his orders Questioning re- 
vealed that Wilbur had missed 
his afternoon snack and thought 
that a full portion of one steak 

14 



and half of the other would com- 
pensate for his fast. “Vegetables, 
too,” said Marcus. 

“Pa, you know I don’t like that 
stuff.” 

“Vegetables,” said Marcus, 
watching to make sure his son 
selected a balanced diet. After 
deliberation, he decided on a 
high protein vegetable plate for 
himself, though ordinarily he 
liked meat. He couldn’t get that 
idea out of his mind. 

The low rectangular serving 
robot scurried up and began dis- 
pensing food with a flurry of ex- 
tensibles. Marcus noted that the 
steaks were identical with those 
served in the hotel. “Waiter, 
what is the origin of those 
steaks?” 

“The same as all meat. Hy- 
gienically grown in a bath of 
nutrients that supply all the 
necessary food elements. Trim- 
med daily and delivered fresh 
and tender, ready for instant 
preparation.” 

“I’m familiar with the process,” 
snapped Marcus, wincing as his 
son chewed the gray, watery sub- 
stance. “What I asked was . the 
origin, the ultimate origin. From 
what animals were the first cells 
taken?” 

“I don’t know. No other pro- 
tein source is so free from con- 
tamination.” 

“Will the manager know?” 

“Perhaps.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Tell him I would like to see 
him.” 

“I’ll pass the request along. But 
it won’t do any good. The man- 
ager can’t come. It’s a robot at- 
tached to the building.” 

“Then I’ll go to it,” said Mar- 
cus, rising. “Keep the food warm. 
How do I get there?” 

“The manager shouldn’t be 
disturbed,” said the robot as it 
placed thermoshields over the 
food. “It’s the small room to the 
rear, at the right of the kitchen.” 
Marcus found the place with- 
out difficulty. The manager 
lighted up as he came in. The 
opposite wall blinked and a chair 
swung out for him. “Complaint?” 
said the manager hollowly. The 
manager was hollow. 

“Not exactly,” said Marcus, re- 
peating his request. 

The manager meditated brief- 
ly- 

“Are you an Outer?” 

“I am.” 

“I thought so. Only Outers ask 
that question. I’ll have to find 
out some day.” 

“Make it today,” said Marcus. 
“An excellent thought,” said 
the manager. “I’ll do it. But this is 
a chain restaurant and so you’ll 
have to wait. If you don’t mind 
the delay, I’ll plug in one of our 
remote information banks.” 
Marcus did mind delay, but it 
was worse not knowing. He 
waited.

64T HAVE it,” said the robot 
after an interval. “There is 
great difficulty feeding a city this 
large. In fact, there is with all of 
Earth — it’s greatly overpopu- 
lated.” 

“So I understand,” mumbled 
Marcus. 

“The trouble began forty-five 
or fifty years ago with the water 
supply,” said the robot. “It was 
sanitary, but there was too great 
or not great enough concentra- 
tion of minerals in it. Information 
isn’t specific on this point. The 
robots in control of the tanks 
found that beef, pork, lamb and 
chicken in all their variety would 
not grow fast enough. Many 
tanks wouldn’t grow at all. 

“The robots communicated 
this fact to higher authorities and 
were told to find out how to cor- 
rect the situation. They investi- 
gated and determined that either 
the entire water-system would 
have to be overhauled, or a new 
and hardier protein would have 
to be developed. Naturally, it 
would require incalculable labor 
to install a new water-system. 
They didn’t recommend it.” 

“Naturally,” said Marcus. 

“The situation was critical. The 
city had to be fed. The tank 
robots were told to find the new 
protein. Resources were thrown 
open to them that weren’t hither- 
to available. In a short time, they 
solved the problem. About half 

15 




of the tanks that were not grow- 
ing properly were cleaned out 
and the new protein placed in 
them. The old animal name sys- 
tem was outmoded so the new 
lot number system was devised 
and applied to every tank re- 
gardless of its ultimate origin.” 

“Then nobody has any idea 
what they’re eating,” said Mar- 
cus. “But what was that new 
protein? That’s what I want to 
know.” 

“It was hardy. It came from 
the most adaptable creature on 
Earth,” said the robot. “And 
there was another factor in favor 
of it. The flesh of all mammals is 
nearly the same. But there are 
differences. The ideal protein for 
a meat-eating animal is one 
which exactly matches the crea- 
ture’s own body, eliminating food 
that can’t be fully utilized.” 

Marcus closed his eyes and 
grasped the arm of the chair. 

“Do you feel ill?” inquired the 
managing robot. “Shall I call the 
doctor? No? Well, as I was say- 
ing, there was already a supply 
of animal tissue on hand. It was 
this that the robots used. It’s 
funny that you’re asking this. Not 
many people are so curious.” 

“They didn’t care,” snarled 
Marcus. “As long as they were 
fed, they didn’t ask what it was.” 

“Why should they?” asked the 
robot. “The tissue was already 
well adapted to growth tanks. 

16 



Scrupulously asceptic, in no way 
did it harm the original donors 
who were long since dead. And 
there was little difference in the 
use of it, anyway. No one would 
hesitate if he were injured and 
needed skin or part of a liver or 
a new eye. This was replacement 
from the inside, by a digestive 
process rather than a medical 
one.” 

“The robots took tissue from 
the surgery replacement tanks,” 
said Marcus. “Do you deny it?” 

“That’s what I’ve been telling 
you,” said the robot. “A very 
clever solution considering how 
little time they had. However 
only about half of the tanks had 
to be replaced.” 

“Cannibals,” said Marcus, near- 
ly destroying the chair as he 
hurled it away from him. 

“What’s a cannibal?” asked 
the robot. 

But Marcus wasn’t there to 
answer. He went back to the res- 
taurant, under control by the 
time he reached the table. He 
couldn’t tell Wilbur because Wil- 
bur had finished eating except 
for the vegetables which were 
mostly untouched. Marcus sat 
down and took the shields off 
the food, looking at it gloomily. 

“Pa, aren’t you going to eat?” 
asked Wilbur. 

“As soon as I get my breath 
back,” he said. It wasn’t bad when 
he ate, but the mere thought of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




food was distasteful. He gianced 
sternly at his son. “Wilbur, here- 
after you may not order meat. As 
long as we are on Earth, you will 
ask for eggs.” 

“Just eggs?” said Wilbur in- 
credulously. “Gee, they’re real 
expensive here. Anyway, I don’t 
like them without a rasher of — ” 
“Eggs,” said Marcus. Another 
thought occurred to him. “Sunny- 
side up. No cook can disguise 
that.” 

T HE sky was dark when they 
left the restaurant. After 
work, traffic had abated and the 
entertainment rush hadn’t come 
on the streets, which were now 
curiously silent and deserted. 
Marcus caught sight of the tall 
spire of Information Center glis- 
tening against the evening sky. 

“Where are we going?” asked 
Wilbur. 

“To the hotel. We have a hard 
day’s work tomorrow.” 

“Can we walk? I mean, we 
can’t see anything in the tubes.” 
“It’s a long walk.” 

“It’s right over there. I’ve 
walked farther before breakfast.” 
Marcus noted with approval 
that Wilbur had used the In- 
formation Center as a landmark 
to deduce the correct location of 
the hotel. His training showed. 
Even in the confusion of the city, 
he wouldn’t get lost. “It’s farther 
than you think, but we’ll walk if 



you want. It may be our last 
evening on Earth. At least, I sin- 
cerely hope so.” 

They went on. In time they 
saw what there was to see. It was 
a city, vast and sprawling, but 
still just another city Man had 
created. The buildings were huge, 
but constructed as all buildings 
had to be, out of stone and steel, 
concrete and plastic. Women 
were beautiful, tastefully gowned 
and coiffured, but it was easy to 
see that they were merely women. 
Shops were elaborate and fanci- 
ful, but there was a limit to what 
they displayed, an end to the free 
play of fancy. 

By the time they realized they 
were tired, they were close to the 
hotel. There wasn’t any use 
in seeking transportation, since 
they’d get where they were going 
almost as fast either way. They 
had kept to the main thorough- 
fares since there was more to see. 
But Marcus had quickly accus- 
tomed himself to the pattern of 
streets and as they neared their 
destination he saw a short cut 
which they took. 

It was getting late and the 
street was dark. He began to 
wonder whether they should have 
come this way. He decided they 
shouldn’t have. A faint red flash 
from the doorway indicated that 
his tardy decision was sound but 
useless. His knees tingled where 
the red flash struck him and in

the middle of a stride he felt he 
didn’t have any feet He fell for- 
ward, trying to shield Wilbur. 
Wilbur was falling, too, and they 
collided on the downward arc. 

Hands seized him, lifting him 
up. He was in no condition to 
struggle. Besides it wasn’t safe. 
A tingler wasn’t a lethal weapon, 
but it could have unpleasant ef- 
fects if used carelessly or hastily. 
He didn’t think they were in any 
real danger and it was best not 
to provoke their captors. 

B Y THE time he had recov- 
ered sufficiently to be aware 
of what was going on, he found 
he had been carried to a space 
between two buildings, hidden 
from the street by a masonry 
projection. Wilbur was sitting be- 
side him and a dim light played 
on them. 

“Don’t move,” said a voice that 
made an effort to be rough and 
hard, but failed by an octave. 
Now that Marcus thought of it 
the hands that had lifted him 
were small and soft. Their cap- 
tors were women. The discon- 
nected impressions of the city 
seemed to fall into a pattern. He 
was not greatly surprised at what 
was happening. 

The light moved closer and 
Marcus could make out the figure 
of the woman who held it. Be- 
hind her were others — all 
women. But even delicate hands 



were capable of leveling a tingler. 
“Don’t say anything,” he said to 
his son in a low voice. Wilbur 
nodded dazedly. 

“No whispering,” barked the 
soprano, shining the light directly 
in his eyes. “Now, are either of 
you married?” 

Marcus sighed; so that was it. 
Poor Earth was in a bad way 
when a pudgy unattractive clerk 
could get a high-salaried job sole- 
ly because he was male. 

“Answer me,” demanded the 
high unsteady voice. “Are either 
of you married? On Earth, I 
mean.” 

Marcus could see her clearly, 
now that his eyes had become 
accustomed to the light. She was 
young, barely out of her teens. 

“What kind of question is that? 
When you’re married, you’re mar- 
ried. It doesn’t matter where you 
are.” On Earth, apparently, it did. 

“Outers,” she exclaimed hap- 
pily. “I’ve always hoped I’d find 
one. They’re real men. Now let’s 
see, which one shall I take?” She 
flashed the light on Wilbur, who 
squirmed and blinked. 

“He’s younger and will proba- 
bly last longer,” she said critic- 
ally. “On the other hand, he’ll be 
clumsy and inexperienced.” 

She turned to Marcus. “You 
need a shave,” she said crisply. 
“Your beard is turning gray. I 
think I’ll take you. Older men 
are nice.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

“You can’t have me,” said Mar- 
cus. She was near and he could 
have taken both the weapon and 
the light from her. But he 
couldn’t stand, much less walk, 
and there were other women in 
the background, all armed prob- 
ably, watching the girl who 
seemed to be their leader. “You 
see, I am married. Wilma 
wouldn’t like it, if I took another 
wife.” 

“Not even just for the time 
you’re on Earth? It isn’t much to 
ask.” She turned the light on her- 
self. “Am I unattractive?” 

She was not outstandingly 
beautiful, but since she was 
dressed as scantily as law allowed 
and fashion decreed Marcus 
could see her desirability. “How 
old are you?” he asked. 

“Old enough,” she said. “In 
eleven months, I’ll be twenty- 
one.” 

“You’re pretty,” said Marcus. 
“If I were fifteen or twenty years 
younger — and not married — 
I’d come courting.” 

“But you did.” she said in 
amazement. “Why did you come 
down a dark street, if you weren’t 
looking for romance?” 

T HIS, it seemed, is what passed 
for romance on Earth. Men 
must be outnumbered at least 
three to one. It tied in with what 
he had so far observed. “I’m 
sorry for your trouble,” he said. 



“But you must remember that 
we’re Outers. We’re not familiar 
with your customs. We were 
merely taking a short cut to our 
hotel.” 

She gestured in sullen defeat. 
“I suppose it was a mistake. But 
why can’t I have him, then? He’s 
not married.” 

“He isn’t, nor will he be for 
some time. He has barely turned 
seventeen. I won’t give my per- 
mission.” 

“He’s your son? Then you are 
experienced. Are you sure you 
won’t reconsider me — just while 
you’re on Earth? I told you I 
don’t like young men. Maybe 
that’s because my father was an 
older man.” 

“I’m sure he was,” said Marcus. 
“However that’s no reason to find 
me irresistible.” He tried to stand, 
but his legs were rubbery and he 
sat down quickly. 

She looked at him with con- 
cern. “Does it hurt? I guess we 
gave you the strongest charge.” 
She handed him the light and 
went to the women who were 
standing some distance behind 
her. He heard her whispering. 
Presently she came back. 

She knelt beside him and be- 
gan rubbing his legs. “I sent them 
away,” she said. ‘They’re going 
to look for someone else. It was 
my turn to propose to whomever 
we captured, but now you spoiled 
it.” 



MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY

He smiled at her earnestness. 
“I’m sure you deserve better than 
you’re apt to find with these 
strange methods of courtship. 
However I think you should help 
my son. You gave him a charge, 
too.” 

“I bet I did,” she said scorn- 
fully. “Don’t worry about him. 
Kids recover easily.” 

“Should I clout her, Pa?” asked 
Wilbur as he stood up, bending 
his knees gingerly. “She had no 
business shooting us.” 

“She didn’t, but you have no 
business talking like that. Touch 
her and I’ll wallop you.” 

The girl ignored Wilbur, put- 
ting her arms around Marcus and 
helping him to his feet. From the 
girl’s reaction to him you’d never 
think so, but he was getting old. 
The first step was proof of it. He 
could walk unaided, but it felt 
as if someone were pulling pins 
out of his legs at the rate of two 
or three a second. 

“I’ll go with you to the hotel,” 
said the girl. “There are probably 
other marriage gangs out. If they 
see me with you, they’ll think 
I’ve already made my catch.” 
Marcus frowned in the dark- 
ness. Wilbur was getting entirely 
the wrong idea about women. 
He’d find it difficult to adjust to 
the different conditions at home. 
Marcus told the girl their names 
and asked hers. 

“Mary Ellen.” 



“That’s all, Mary Ellen?” 

“Of course, I have a last name, 
but I’m hoping to change it.” 

He sighed in resignation. 
“Mary Ellen, we won’t discuss 
marriage again. Is this clear? 
However I have plans for you. 
I’ll get in touch with you before 
we leave Earth.” They were near- 
ing a brightly lit thoroughfare 
and he felt safer. 

“I was hoping you’d say that,” 
she said wistfully. She dug into 
a tiny purse and handed him a 
card. “You’ll notice there’s an- 
other name on it, too. That’s 
Chloe, my half-sister. She’s smart 
and I like her, but I hope you 
don’t like her — not better than 
me, anyway.” 

“I’m sure I won’t. But why 
half-sister? I’d think it would be 




20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




rather difficult for your mother 
to marry again.” 

“Of course she couldn’t,” she 
said scornfully. “No woman’s al- 
lowed more than half a — ” 
“Mary Ellen!” 

“All right, I won’t say it,” she 
said crossly. “But you asked.” 

H E COULD fill in the missing 
information. With women 
drastically outnumbering men, 
husbands had to be shared. Men 
were allowed more than one 
mate, but women never were. 
Perhaps the development of poly- 
gamy had been inevitable. 

Earth was the center of a vast 
and spreading civilization. Men 
went out to settle the newly dis- 
covered planets while, for the 
most part, women tended to re- 



MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



21 




main behind. More than that, 
there were some women who 
came to Earth from planets that 
had been settled longer, attracted 
by the glamor of an older civiliza- 
tion and high-paying jobs, never 
realizing until they got there the 
other conditions that went with 
it. 

Earth’s dilemma was therefore 
a partial solution to one of the 
problems of his own planet. But 
the important problem, getting 
the name changed to Mezzerow, 
was harder than he had antici- 
pated. He wasn’t looking forward 
to tomorrow. 

He noticed Mary Ellen glanc- 
ing curiously around. “Is there 
anything wrong?” he asked. 

“Nooo. It’s just sort of funny 
that you’d stay here — in the 
heart of the unmarried girls’ resi- 
dential district.” She grinned at 
him. “Maybe I’d better go in with 
you.” 

“I think you’d better,” he said. 
That’s what the pudgy clerk had 
meant. He should have listened 
to him and gone to the men’s 
hotel. 

The lobby was crowded with 
women, many of whom, he sus- 
pected, had been waiting for their 
return. On a man-starved planet, 
word got around. Perhaps he was 
imagining it, but he thought he 
heard an audible sigh of disap- 
pointment when they came in 
with Mary Ellen. She had more 



than repaid them for the few 
anxious moments she had caused. 
Much more, though she didn’t 
know it yet. 

They went directly to their 
rooms and Marcus sent Wilbur 
inside, lingering at the door to 
talk with the girl. “Should I come 
in?” she asked hopefully. “I’m 
really sorry about your legs.” 

“You will not come in, Mary 
Ellen. I don’t trust myself alone 
with you.” 

“You mean it?” 

“I was never more sincere.” He 
almost believed it himself. 

“We don’t have to get married 
if you’re not going to be here 
long enough to make it worth- 
while,” she said happily. “I was 
thinking — ” 

He glanced warningly inside 
the room. 

“He’s a big nuisance,” she 
whispered. “Look. I’ve got to 
work tomorrow, but in the eve- 
ning I’ll be free. Put the kid on 
a merry-go-round and come and 
see me, huh?” She threw her arms 
around Marcus and kissed him 
passionately. Then she turned 
and ran down the hall. 

Marcus shook his head and 
went into his room. 

I N THE morning, Marcus had 
little difficulty contacting an 
infolegger. For a rather large sum, 
a map purporting to show the 
location of A-CELO exchanged 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




bands. For another sum, a map 
of the principal transportation 
tubes was added to it Both were 
assuredly out of date in many 
respects, but were probably cor- 
rect in the one detail Marcus was 
concerned with. 

They started rather late to 
avoid the morning rush. There 
were some transportation compli- 
cations. At the first trial they 
arrived at the wrong section of 
the city. After consultation with 
various passengers and robot way 
stations, they got it straightened 
out. Penciling corrections On the 
map, they retraced their route, 
making only one mistake along 
the way. This mistake was not 
their fault. A transfer junction 
had been relocated since they 
had passed through it on the way 
out 

They got to their destination 
in good time, perhaps faster than 
if they had used the services of 
Information Center. A-CELO was 
also an example of neo-drive-in 
classical. But instead of resem- 
bling something appropriate, say 
a five or six pointed star, it ap- 
peared to be a mere jumble of 
children’s curv-blocks. A closer 
look convinced Marcus that his 
first appraisal had been wrong. 
Originally it must have been 
built to house another A-function. 
Perhaps A-WR (Anatomy; wom- 
an, reclining). 

Whatever it was on the out- 
MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



side, A-CELO was confusion 
within. Marcus found it impossi- 
ble to get near the question 
booths. Robots scurried about in 
seemingly useless tasks and work- 
men shouted orders that no one 
paid attention to. In the midst of 
the dust and turmoil, one man 
stood on a platform and watched 
the frantic effort with bored 
serenity. 

"Moving,” he said automatic- 
ally as Marcus approached. 

“Where to?” 

“I don’t know. It depends on 
whom we can bump.” 

"IMf ARCUS paled visibly. They 
were moving and didn’t know 
where. Another day and his map 
was useless. And if this man was 
right, even Information Center 
wouldn’t know where A-CELO 
was tomorrow. “Isn’t there a 
planning commission?” he said. 
“Don’t they tell you where to 
move?” 

The man shrugged. “There’s a 
planning commission. But they 
had too many responsibilities and 
had to move to a larger building, 
the same as we’re doing. Until 
they get settled, everyone’s on 
his own.” The man spoke quietly 
into the mike and the tempo of 
the removal robots accelerated. 
He turned back to Marcus and 
added an explanation: “Three ex- 
ploration ships returned yester- 
day, loaded to the brim with 

23 




micro-data. That’s why we have 
to move.” 

Marcus rubbed his face. He 
could see it posed a problem. It 
was not merely the storage of 
new data, the data also had to 
be made available to the public. 
This required new offices, human 
supervisors, robot clerks. 

That was the way they did 
things on Earth, but he wished 
they’d waited a few days. “You 
can’t be moving this stuff out on 
the streets. Somebody must have 
an idea where you’re going. Tell 
me who he is. I’ve got to find out 
where you’ll be tomorrow.” 

“Oh, no. If you found where 
we’re moving, you’d learn who 
we’re going to bump,” said the 
man with cheerful cunning. 
“They’d take steps to repel us. 
Can’t have that.” The man 
scratched his head. “Tell you, if 
you’re really honest — - if you’re 
not a department spy — I can 
show you how to take care of 
your business today.” 

“I’m an Outer,” said Marcus. 
“I don’t care about your squab- 
bles. I want to get something 
settled and get out of here.” 

“You look like an Outer,” said 
the man. “Here’s what you do. 
Part of the department is still 
functioning. Go to the side en- 
trance. Question booths there are 
open.” He turned back to the 
mike and barked orders that had 
no visible effect on anything. 

24 



*T*HE man was partly wrong. 

-*■ The side entrance was open, 
but corridors and booths were 
jammed with displaced informa- 
tion seekers. Marcus was not easi- 
ly discouraged. By now he was 
accustomed to the vast machina- 
tions required for the simplest 
things. He went to the back en- 
trance. It, too, was jammed, but 
after a short desperate struggle 
he squeezed into a booth, leaving 
Wilbur to hang on the outside. 

The official who answered him 
was sleepy and harassed, a diffi- 
cult expression. He yawned and 
took his feet off the desk to 
acknowledge the call and then a 
robot removed the desk. He had 
no place to put his feet so he 
kept them firmly on the floor as 
if he expected that, too, to vanish. 

Marcus stated the request 
clearly, spreading the chart for 
the man to see. “Here is the 
original from which the photo- 
tape was made and sent to Earth 
with his comments. I don’t know 
what happened here. Perhaps the 
tape was fuzzy or it may have 
been fogged in transit by radia- 
tion. Or it may have been faulty 
interpretation on the part of a 
robot.” 

The official peered out of the 
view plate. “Messy Row. Mezze- 
row. Ha, ha.” He laughed per- 
functorily and got up to pace. A 
robot came near the chair and he 
sat down hastily. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Here, you can see that in his 
own hand he spelled it Mezze- 
row,” said Marcus. “He named it 
after himself as every explorer is 
entitled to do once in his career. 
I ask that in simple justice the 
mistake be corrected. I have a 
petition signed by everyone on 
the planet.” 

The official waved the docu- 
ments back. “It doesn’t matter 
who signed,” he said. “We don’t 
allow these things to influence 
our decision.” He put his head in 
his hand though he had no desk 
for his elbow. His lips moved 
soundlessly as he framed the 
reply. 

“I want to give you an insight 
to our problems,” he said. “First, 
consider pilots. There are all sorts 
of beautiful names for planets. 
Plum Branch, Coarsegold, Waves 
End, but there’s only one Messy 
Row. It’s a bright spot on their 
voyage. They look at the charts 
and see it — Messy Row. They 
laugh. Laughter is a therapeutic 
force against the loneliness of 
space. The name of your planet 
is distinctive.” 

“We don’t care for the distinc- 
tion,” said Marcus. “It’s got so 
bad, we call it Messy Row our- 
selves, when we’re not thinking. 
Who’s going to settle on a planet 
they laugh at?” The official didn’t 
seem to hear. Marcus adjusted 
the volume control, but there 
didn’t seem to be anything wrong 

MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



with the sound or the volume. 

“This is only a small part of it,” 
continued the man. “Do you have 
any idea how many charts we 
print? You would have us make 
them obsolete. Think of the ships 
roaming through space, many 
never touching Earth. How can 
we reach them with corrected 
charts?” 

“I’m glad you said corrected 
charts,” said Marcus. “But cor- 
rected charts shouldn’t be any 
harder to deliver than new ones 
— which, you’ll admit, you’re 
always making.” 

“I can’t compromise our fam- 
ous accuracy for the whims of a 
few selfish individuals,” said the 
official. He stood up and this time 
the robot whisked the chair away. 
He smiled and reached out his 
hand for the familiar vertical file. 
The file wasn’t there, but a robot 
was. It took his hand and tried to 
lead him away. He shook himself 
loose. “You can see we’re busy. 
Come back when we’re not in the 
midst of an upheaval. I might 
consider a request that at present 
I must turn down.” He walked 
briskly away, leaving Marcus 
with a fine view of an empty 
room — until a robot came and 
took the viewplate to the other 
end. 

Marcus eased out of the booth. 
Wilbur was waiting with an 
anxious face. “I know it’s past 
noon,” he said gloomily to his son.

“We’ll get something to eat 
Eggs.” Wilbur knew better than 
to protest. 

T HEY left A-CELO before the 
removal robots arrived at the 
rear section. In the quiet of a 
nearby restaurant Marcus con- 
sidered the problem anew. The 
mission hadn’t been entirely a 
failure. He could accomplish one 
important task without the aid of 
any government agency. In fact, 
it was better if he didn’t ask their 
help; 

But he owed something to the 
memory of Captain Mathew 
Mezzerow. Mezzerow his father 
had called the planet — and 
Mezzerow it was going to be. 

There was also Wilma. She 
had arrived when both she and 
the settlement were quite young. 
Courted and feted and proposed 
to endlessly, she had found the 
excitement of being the center of 
attention irresistible. She hadn’t 
minded the name then, not since 
she was the prettiest, most attrac- 
tive girl there. There weren’t 
many others. 

But she had changed as Messy 
Row had grown. They had four 
sons now, Wilbur the oldest. Four 
sons. She was not concerned 
whether they would marry. Her 
sons were smart and handsome 
and belonged to the best family 
— they would experience no 
trouble in finding wives. But if 

26 



they did she could always take 
them visiting — to a planet on 
which there was no woman 
shortage. 

Once she had been slightly 
giddy, even after they were mar- 
ried. Marcus had often wondered 
how her lashes could possibly re- 
main intact when other men 
came near. She had outgrown 
that phase and when the chry- 
salis burst it revealed a different 
woman. 

Out of the flirtatious girl came 
the homemaker. Everything near 
her was immaculate. Fences 
around the house were white- 
washed and the lawns were al- 
ways mowed. Inside, everything 
was as tidy as a pin. Mud was 
never tracked in. Wilma no long- 
er approved of Messy Row as the 
name of any planet on which she 
lived. 

Marcus had to have help. 
Someone who lived on Earth 
would know the proper approach 
better than he. He fished out the 
card Mary Ellen had given him 
and the longer he looked the 
more certain he was that he had 
found the person. It was not 
Mary Ellen. It was her sister. 

Mary Ellen and Chloe — no 
last names given. Apparently this 
was custom, the way unmarried 
girls informed the world that they 
were looking for mates. In addi- 
tion to their names was the ad- 
dress at which they both lived. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




There was also the occupation 
of each. Mary Ellen was a junior 
attendant, whatever that was. But 
Chloe was far more important. 
She was an astrographer, a senior 
supervisor astrographer. 

Marcus ate rapidly, a definite 
plan materializing with each bite. 
Chloe was the key. With her aid, 
he should be able to change 
Messy Row. He smiled reflec- 
tively. With what fie had to offer 
she would certainly consent to 
help him — even if it was illegal. 

M ARY Ellen was not at home, 
but Chloe was and she wel- 
comed them. Marcus truthfully 
explained how they’d met her 
sister. Chloe commented unfavor- 
ably on the marriage gangs and, 
though Marcus agreed, he re- 
ceived the remarks in silence. It 
was not for him to change the 
mores of Earth. Society had to 
work with what there was. 

Chloe was small and dark in 
contrast to the larger blonde 
Mary Ellen. She was older, too. 
Once she must have been quite 
pretty, but instead of easing gra- 
ciously into the poise of maturity 
she had been forced into the 
early thirties without a husband. 
The struggle showed. 

She was cordial when they 
came in and even more cordial 
when he finished outlining his 
plan. “Yes, something can be 
done,” she said quietly. “I will set 



up the organization and ship 
them out in groups of ten. I have 
a vacation in a few months and 
Mary Ellen and I will come then.” 
She glanced at him anxiously. 
“That is, if you think I’m needed.” 

“You are,” he assured her. “We 
need wives, mothers, skilled tech- 
nicians. I can’t think of anyone 
who will fit the description 
better.” 

“Then you’ll see me again,” she 
said. “And not merely for the 
reasons you think. You see, I 
have a high-salaried job and 
could have been married before 
this. But it didn’t seem right. I 
want to feel I’m of some use to 
a civilization that seems to have 
forgotten people like me exist.” 

“Mezzerow needs you,” he said. 
“I was thinking of a man I know. 
Joe Ainsworth, a quiet thought- 
ful fellow of about thirty-five or 
thirty-seven. His trouble has been 
that he likes pretty women who 
are also intelligent. I’ll have him 
keep an eye out for you.” 

She smiled and the transforma- 
tion took place. She was pretty. 
Marcus wondered whether there 
was such a person as Joe Ains- 
worth. There must be, in kind, if 
not in name. 

“So much for that,” said Chloe 
briskly. ‘The rest of your plan 
for Messy Row is a fine example 
of muddy thinking. In the first 
place I work for a private com- 
pany, not the government.” 



MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY

“But you make government 
charts.” 

“True. But let me show you 
what I mean. What’s the code 
number of the chart Messy Row 
is on?” 

Marcus quoted it from memo- 
ry. The code of a map on which 
a given system could be found 
was almost as important as the 
name. 

Chloe closed her eyes. “No,” 
she said when she opened them. 
“That’s done in another depart- 
ment. I couldn’t possibly change 
it to Mezzerow.” 

“But if you changed it, the 
name would stay,” said Marcus. 
“I’ll give you money to see that 
it gets done. Once it’s on the map 
nobody will say anything. Even 
if they do notice, all they’ll know 
is that there’s a conflict between 
early and late editions. They’ll 
have to go directly to the source 
to straighten it out. And we’re 
the source.” 

Chloe smiled fleetingly. “It’s 
never done that way. Do you 
think they’d send nine hundred 
and forty-seven light-years to find 
whether the name is Messy Row 
or Mezzerow?” She crossed her 
legs and they were nice legs. 
There had to be a Joe Ainsworth. 

“It won’t work,” said Chloe. “I 
can’t make the change myself or 
even bribe someone to do it.” She 
noticed his dejection and touched 
his hand. “Don’t be discouraged. 

28 



There’s another way. An Outer 
wouldn’t think of it because he 
doesn’t know what goes on be- 
hind the scenes.” 

“I’ve seen enough to give me 
a good idea,” said Marcus. 

“I wonder. Have you noticed 
that when you ask for informa- 
tion you are always answered by 
a human? And just as obviously 
he doesn’t know. He has to con- 
tact a robot and relay the in- 
formation along.” 

H E HADN’T thought of it. 

The omnipresent vertical file 
was, in reality, a robot memory 
bank. Why not give the robot a 
voice and dispense with innumer- 
able men and women? The ques- 
tion was on his face when he 
looked at Chloe. 

“Robots are logical — nothing 
more,” she said. “Most questions 
can’t be given black and white 
answers. There must be an inter- 
mediary who understands the 
limitations of the mechanical 
mind to interpret it to the public.” 
“I don’t see how this is going 
to help me,” he said. 

“You’ve been trying to get an 
official to say that you’re right 
and he’ll see that the change is 
made. Abandon that approach. 
He’ll never take the time. Write 
your request.” 

“For forty years we’ve been 
writing. That’s why I’m here.” 
Chloe smiled again. “The num- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ber of letters received by the 
government in one year reaches 
a remarkable total. Or perhaps 
the total isn’t huge when you 
consider how many humans in 
the Universe there are. Anyway, 
off-planet letters are never 
opened, because there’s no way 
to tell from the outside which 
are important. So they’re all 
pulped and used as nutrients in 
food tanks.” 

Marcus nodded dubiously. “I 
see. Anyone who thinks he has 
something important will come 
here ... as I did. And if he isn’t 
satisfied he tries to go over the 
head of whoever refused the re- 
quest. This volume is still great, 
but it’s small enough to be pro- 
cessed without falling hopelessly 
behind.” 

“Exactly. And if you phrase 
your request properly there’s a 
good chance it will be granted, 
even if it is foolish.” 

“This isn’t foolish,” said Mar- 
cus, rubbing his hands. “I’ve got 
all the facts. I can write them in 
my sleep.” 

“Who said anything about 
facts?” said Chloe. “The worst 
thing you can do is to give them 
facts. Don’t you see what I’m try- 
ing to tell you?” 

Marcus took a deep breath. 
“No,” he said. 

“Let’s go over it again. Mathew 
Mezzerow discovered a planet 
and named it after himself. Does 

MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



this mean anything? Not really. 
Does it mean anything that 
Messy Row will be settled more 
slowly because of the name? 
Again no. Thousands of other 
planets will gain the settlers that 
Messy Row loses. The robot will 
refuse a request based on facts 
and from the government’s view- 
point will be justified.” 

“But you just said robots don’t 
handle requests.” 

“Face to face they don’t. You 
would resent it as an arrogant 
bureaucracy being told you 
couldn’t have something by a 
robot. But you don’t see who 
processes written requests. And 
in these matters the government 
uses robots because they’re more 
efficient.” 

It was too complex for Marcus. 
Robots processed written re- 
quests, but not those made in 
person. Robots were logical and 
only logical and therefore ordi- 
narily should not be appealed to 
on the basis of reason. 

He swallowed hard and looked 
at Chloe. “What should I do?” 
he asked. 

“Emotion,” she said. “Robots 
don’t understand emotion. But 
they can and have been built to 
recognize emotion. On a minor 
matter such as this, you need to 
overload the emotion recognition 
factor. 

“Merely identify the planet. 
Then stress not the justice of 



29 




your claim but the anguish you've 
suffered. Make it extreme — 
paint a picture of the misery the 
'error has already caused and will 
continue to cause. If you make it 
strong enough, the robot will set 
aside rational processes and grant 
the request.” 

T BEGAN to be clear. As the 
government grew in size and 
complexity and contact with the 
governed parts became more 
tenuous, greater reliance had to 
be placed in logic, machinemade 
logic. But machines could not 
hope to encompass all the irra- 
tionality of Man. And irrational 
demands were apt to cause 
trouble. Pride was irrational, and 
so was the greater part of human 
misery. 

Therefore, in minor matters, 
the government had provided a 
safety valve for irrational re- 
quests. Only in minor matters, 
men still decided important 
issues. But in the innumerable 
small decisions that had to be 
made daily, robots would set 
aside their logical process if a 
strong emotion were present. 

“Pa,” said Wilbur from the 
corner in which he had been 
squirming sleepily. 

“Not now, Wilbur,” growled 
Marcus. “I suppose you’re hun- 
gry.” In his mind he was com- 
posing the request. It was 
unlike anything he’d written. 



“I think there’s something in 
the kitchen,” said Chloe, but Mar- 
cus hastily refused. Even on her 
salary she couldn’t afford to serve 
eggs. 

Mary Ellen came in just then. 
She slouched in dispiritedly, 
cloak drooping about her. “Hi, 
sis,” she said as she opened the 
door. 

Then she saw Marcus and 
revived abruptly. She flung her- 
self across the room and into his 
lap, wrapping her arms around 
him. “Mark, dear,” she said, smil- 
ing cattily over his head at her 
sister. 

Marcus sighed regretfully. 
Heaven knew what the boy in 
his innocence would tell his 
mother. He worked himself loose 
from the girl’s embrace and ex- 
plained why he was here. 

“Then we’re going to Messy 
Row?” 

“In a few months,” said Chloe. 
“Marcus is setting up a perpetual 
fund to help those who can’t pay 
their fare.” 

“Oh, I’ll go,” said Mary Ellen, 
looking steadily at Marcus. “But 
you needn’t expect me to get 
married.” 

Marcus smiled to himself. She 
was dramatizing. When she found 
her choice wasn’t limited she 
would scarcely remember him. 
There was, if Marcus now re- 
called correctly, a Joe Ainsworth, 
twenty-four or five. What made 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




him seem older, when Marcus 
had first thought of him, was his 
prematurely gray hair. The two 
should be a perfect match. Chloe 
could not have Joe Ainsworth 
after all, but there’d be another 
for her. 

“Please change, Mary Ellen,” 
said Marcus. “We’re going to 
dinner.” 

“All of us?” 

“Certainly all of us,” said Mar- 
cus dryly, noting her disapproval. 

A S SHE left he began discuss- 
ing with Chloe what he 
should say in the request. Ap- 
parently there were nuances he 
didn’t understand because he 
still didn’t have it settled to his 
satisfaction when Mary Ellen 
returned. 

“I’m ready,” she said, pirouet- 
ting for his approval. 

She was ready, but not for a 
quiet little dinner. “I suggest a 
wrap for your shoulders,” he said. 
She made a face, but went to get 
one. 

“How long will it take to get 
this through?” he asked Chloe. 

“Four to six years. There’s a 
backlog.” 

“Four to six years?” he repeat- 
ed increduously. He began to see 
that the loophole the government 
had provided was very small in- 
deed. Who would bother, even if 
he felt strongly about it, when he 
knew it would take so long? 

MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



“That’s going through regular 
channels.” Chloe frowned and 
smoothed her hair. “You may be 
very lucky though. Today, just 
today, we might find a much 
faster way. You said they are 
moving A-CELO?” 

“They are,” he said, hoping he 
knew what she meant. This was 
a golden opportunity that might 
never come again. 

“Then they’ll be busy through 
the night A workman should 
have access to the master robot” 

Marcus smiled. “I’m an excel- 
lent workman.” 

“You’ll need me, too. You 
won’t recognize what you’re 
after.” 

“Granted. Is it dangerous?” 

“Not physically. But there’s a 
severe penalty for tampering with 
government property. There’s an 
even heavier one for trying to get 
your case considered ahead of 
schedule.” 

He could see why this was so. 
He could also see that Chloe was 
the kind of person Messy Row 
needed. She knew what she was 
getting into, but didn’t hesitate. 
“Then you should come with me. 
But stay in the background. 
Promise me you’ll try to get away 
if I’m caught.” 

She shrugged. “If you’re caught 
you’ll need help on the outside.” 

Mary Ellen came back, a trans- 
parent shimmering wrap over her 
shoulders. She was blonde and 



31 




dazzling. “Where are we going? 
I’m so happy.” 

Marcus loosened his collar and 
sat down. “Dinner’s off, except 
for you two. Chloe and I have 
work to do. Mary Ellen, take 
Wilbur back to the hotel for me. 
Watch after him.” 



“You want me to?” she asked 
despondently. 

“I asked you to.” 

“Then I will.” She arched her 
back, and it was a splendid arch. 
She swirled around, pausing at 
the door. “Come on, brat,” she 
snarled. 





“Pa, I can get along — ” said 
Wilbur. Marcus looked at him 
and he left with Mary Ellen. 

“We haven’t much time,” said 
Marcus when they were alone. 
“First we have to write the re- 
quest. I’ll need your help.” 

Chloe took the cover off a 



small machine in the corner. She 
sat down and turned toward him. 
“We have to emphasize anguish 
and suffering.” 

“Misery,” suggested Marcus. 
“Misery is a good strong word,” 
she agreed. “It isn’t used much 
lately. You should have this acted 
on in hours instead of years.” 

“It will be nice,” said Marcus. 
“I can’t think of any name as bad 
as Messy Row.” Slowly he began 
to speak of the misery resulting 
from the error. Making correc- 
tions as they went, Chloe typed 
it on the tape. 

M ARCUS Mezzerow felt the 
weight of forty-three years 
roll away. He was tired, but it 
was relaxed tiredness that comes 
with achievement. It had been 
easy to walk into A-CELO and 
become part of the bustle and 
confusion. It had even been easy 
to locate the master robot that 
processed decisions on chart 
names. But the rest hadn’t been 
easy even with Chloe to guide 
and counsel him. 

The master robot was one of 
the last things to be moved. It 
was located deep in the sub-sub- 
basement, ordinarily inaccessible. 
It was a ponderous contrivance, 
awkward to move and quite deli- 
cate. Truck robots backed up to 
it and under it, lifting it up. Tech- 
nicians and extra workmen swift- 
ly began disconnecting it from 

33 




'the building. Marcus was one of 
those extra workmen and he did 
his job as well as the others. But 
he didn’t get an opportunity to 
insert his request in the machine. 

Chloe sauntered past in shape- 
less work clothes, winking as she 
went by. She attracted no atten- 
tion because there were many 
women around. Marcus got ready, 
moving to the front of the 
machine, feeling the spool in his 
pocket. A technician stared sus- 
piciously at him, but there wasn’t 
anything definite to object to. 

Chloe leaned against the wall, 
moving the switch next to her 
with her elbow. Immediately 
standby circuits cut in, but the 
flicker of lights caused a commo- 
tion. The technician next to Mar- 
cus whirled, shouting at Chloe 
who looked startled and tired. 
The tiredness was real. 

In the few free seconds he had, 
Marcus put the spool in the 
machine close to the top. It 
jammed the remaining spools 
closer together, but the machine 
was built to compensate for over- 
loads. There should be no trouble 
from this. 

The spool itself was another 
thing Chloe had helped him with. 
Normally requests were received 
on paper and had to be trans- 
cribed. She had enabled him to 
bypass one stage altogether. 

They worked on after the 
shouting episode. At the first rest 

34 



break they walked up to the 
street level, pausing in a dimly 
lighted hall to strip off their outer 
work clothing which they dis- 
posed of. They were no longer 
workmen. They were pedestrians 
who had passed by and wandered 
in to see what was happening. 
They didn’t belong in the build- 
ing and were told to leave, which 
they did. 

And so it was late when Mar- 
cus entered the hotel. There was 
no one around, for which he was 
thankful. He didn’t feel like fend- 
ing off women at this hour of the 
morning. He went up and let him- 
self in quietly. Wilbur was asleep 
in the adjoining room and the 
door between them was open. He 
closed it before turning on the 
light, which he adjusted to the 
lowest level. Perhaps by this time 
the master chart robot was in a 
new location, grinding out deci- 
sions. Messy Row was or soon 
would be a thing of the past. 

“Pa,” Wilbur called as Marcus 
removed a shoe. 

“Yes. I’m back. Go to sleep.” 
“Did you get it done?” 

“It’s finished. We’re taking the 
next ship out.” 

“Tomorrow?” 

“If there’s one scheduled to- 
morrow.” 

“Before we say good-by?” 
Marcus could hear the bed 
rustle as Wilbur sat up. “We’ll 
send them a note. Anyway they’ll 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




be on Mezzerow in a few 
months.” 

T HE door opened and Wilbur 
stood there, his face white 
and his eyes round and serious. 
“But I gotta say good-by to Mary 
Ellen.” 

Marcus took off the other shoe. 
He should have known not to 
leave them alone. His only ex- 
cuse was that he had been think- 
ing of other things. “I thought 
you didn’t like her,” he said. 

“Pa, that was because I thought 
she didn’t like me,” said Wilbur. 
“But she does. I mean — ” He 
leaned heavily against the door- 
way and his face was long and 
sad. 

Marcus smiled in the near 
darkness. The boy had been 
around girls so seldom he didn’t 
know how they behaved. He had 
mistaken a normal reaction to the 
opposite sex for something more. 
Nevertheless it had worked out 
nicely. Wilbur would not remem- 
ber who it was that Mary Ellen 
had really pursued. With the 
feverish egotism of youth he 
would retain only the memory 
of the interest she’d shown in 
him. A kiss would haunt him for 
years. “Am I to understand you 
made love to her?” he asked 
sternly, amused at his own in- 
accuracy. 

“Oh, Pa,” said Wilbur. “I kissed 
her.” 



“These affairs pass away.” 

“I still gotta say good-by,” said 
Wilbur. 

“We’ll see,” said Marcus. Not 
if he could help it, would they. 
It would be a terrible thing if, 
on parting, Mary Ellen would 
throw her arms around him, ig- 
noring Wilbur. She was too young 
to understand what it might mean 
to someone even younger than 
herself. Marcus went to sleep 
with the satisfaction of a man 
who is in full control of destiny. 

In the morning th^re was no 
need for subterfuge. A ship was 
going near Mezzerow. Not direct- 
ly to it, the planet wasn’t that 
important. But it was merely a 
short local hop from one of the 
planets on the schedule. Mezze- 
row. After all these years he 
could call it by the rightful name 
without feeling provincial. 

The excitement of the return 
trip shook Wilbur out of his pre- 
occupation with Mary Ellen. 
Marcus packed and had the lug- 
gage zipped to the space port. He 
called Chloe and completed the 
financial arrangements and left a 
message for her sister who was at 
work. 

And then they were at the port, 
entering the ship. There was a 
short wait before takeoff. They 
settled in the cabin and Wilbur 
promptly went to sleep. Food, 
sleep, girls; it was all a young 
man had time for. 



MEZZEROW LOVES COMPANY 



35 




But Marcus couldn’t rest 
though he was tired. He wanted 
to hear the schedule announced. 
By this time the correction 
should have been made. The 
rockets started, throbbing softly 
as the tubes warmed up. Wilbur 
awakened with a start, sitting on 
the edge of the acceleration dia- 
phragm. “Do you think they’ll 
announce it?” he asked. 

“I think so,” said Marcus. The 
Universe would know that it was 
Mezzerow. 

The rockets throbbed higher; 
the cabin shook. Weren’t they 
going to call the schedule? The 
intercom in the cabin rasped. 

They were. “Bessemer, Coarse- 
gold,” said the speaker. 

“Get on the acceleration 
couch,” said Marcus as he did so 
himself. 

“Noreen, Cassalmont,” the 
speaker droned. But now there 
was too much interference from 
the rockets. The thrust pressed 
Marcus deep into the flexible dia- 
phragm. The announcer shouted, 
but the blood was roaring in his 
ears. 

Marcus felt himself sliding 
into the gray world of takeoff. 

T HEN they were out among 
the stars and the sensation 
of great weight rolled away. 
Marcus sat up. 

“We didn’t hear it,” said Wil- 
bur, swinging his legs. 

36 



“We didn’t. But they an- 
nounced it.” 

“I wish I’d heard,” said Wilbur. 

It was bothering Marcus, too. 
“The thing to do is to find out,” 
he said. They went into the 
corridor. The rockets were silent; 
the star drive had taken over. 
The solar system was behind 
them, indistinguishable from the 
other stars. 

The pilot was busy and nodded 
his head, asking them to wait 
while he set the controls. He 
flipped levers and after an in- 
terval turned around. “Can I help 
you?” he asked. 

“We didn’t hear the schedule,” 
said Marcus. “The rockets were 
too loud.” 

The pilot smiled apologetic- 
ally. “You know how it is — last 
minute corrections on the charts. 
We had to wait until new ones 
were delivered, just before take- 
off.” 

The oppression that had been 
hovering near lifted a little. 
“I understand,” said Marcus. 
“Would you tell me if Mezzerow 
was one of the corrections?” 

The pilot turned to the list and 
ran his finger down the line. He 
looked and looked again. “No 
Mezzerow here,” he said. 

The oppression had never 
been far away. It came back. “No 
Mezzerow?” said Marcus bleakly. 

“No, but I’ll check.” The pilot 
bent over the list. “Wait. Maybe 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




this is why I didn’t see it. Take 
a look.” 

Marcus looked where the pilot 
was pointing. Above the finger- 
nail, in bold black letters, was the 
name. 

MISERY ROW (Formerly 
Mezzerow — changed to 
avoid confusion with a fami- 
ly name.) 

“Thanks,” said Marcus faintly. 
“That’s what I wanted to know.” 
They went to the cabin in si- 
lence. Marcus closed his eyes but 
that didn’t shut out the new 
name. Nothing could. 

“That’s not as nice as it was,” 
said Wilbur. “What do you sup- 
pose was wrong?” 

“I don’t know,” said Marcus. 
But he did know. Fourteen times, 
or was it eleven, he had used one 
word. He had tried to overload 
the master robot with emotion 
and he had succeeded. 

He had given it one outstand- 



ing impression: Misery. 

“What’ll we do?” said Wilbur. 
“Go back and change it?” 

“No,” said Marcus. “We’ll leave 
it as it is. When you grow up and 
take my place, you can try your 
hand at it if you want.” 

Women would get there re- 
gardless of what it was called. 
Chloe would realize what had 
happened and anyway he’d write. 
She’d see that they got to the 
right place. And with women for 
the men who wanted to settle, 
they’d get along. 

Besides, there was the element 
of uncertainty. He had thought 
nothing could be quite as bad as 
the old name . until this. He 
shuddered to think what the next 
change might be like. 

“Will it be all right?” asked 
Wilbur anxiously. ' 

“It has to be all right,” said 
Marcus, his voice strong with 
resignation. “We’re going home to 
Misery Row.”

Death Wish 

By NED LANG 



Compared with a spaceship in 
distress, going to hell in a 
handbasket is roomy and slowl 



T HE space freighter Queen 
Dierdre was a great, squat, 
pockmarked vessel of the 
Earth -Mars run and she never 
gave anyone a bit of trouble. That 
should have been sufficient warn- 
ing to Mr. Watkins, her engi- 
neer. Watkins was fond of saying 
that there are two kinds of equip- 
ment — the kind that fails bit by 
bit, and the kind that fails all at 
once. 

Watkins was short and red- 
faced, magnificently mustached, 
and always a little out of breath. 



With a cigar in his hand, over a 
glass of beer, he talked most cyni- 
cally about his ship, in the' im- 
memorial fashion of engineers. 
But in reality, Watkins was fool- 
ishly infatuated with Dierdre, 
idealized her, humanized her, and 
couldn’t conceive of anything se- 
rious ever happening. 

On this particular run, Dierdre 
soared away from Terra at the 
proper speed; Mr. Watkins sig- 
naled that fuel was being con- 
sumed at the proper rate; and 
Captain Somers cut the engines

at the proper moment indicated 
by Mr. Rajcik, the navigator. 

As soon as Point Able had 
been reached and the engines 
stopped, Somers frowned and 
studied his complex control 
board. He was a thin and meticu- 
lous man, and he operated his 
ship with mechanical perfection. 
He was well liked in the front 
offices of Mikkelsen Space Lines, 
where Old Man Mikkelsen point- 
ed to Captain Somers’ reports as 
models of neatness and efficiency. 
On Mars, he stayed at the Officers 
Club, eschewing the stews and 
dives of Marsport. On Earth, he 
lived in a little Vermont cottage 
and enjoyed the quiet compan- 
ionship of two cats, a Japanese 
houseboy, and a wife. 

TTIS instructions read true. And 
* yet he sensed something 
wrong. Somers knew every creak, 
rattle and groan that Dierdre 
was capable of making. During 
blastoff, he had heard something 
different In space, something dif- 
ferent had to be wrong. 

“Mr. Rajcik,” he said, turning 
to his navigator, “would you 
check the cargo? I believe some- 
thing may have shifted.” 

“You bet,” Rajcik said cheer- 
fully. He was an almost offen- 
sively handsome young man with 
black wavy hair, blase blue eyes 
and a cleft chin. Despite his ap- 
pearance, Rajcik was thoroughly 

DEATH WISH 



qualified for his position. But he 
was only one of fifty thousand 
thoroughly qualified men who 
lusted for a berth on one of the 
fourteen spaceships in existence. 
Only Stephen Rajcik had had the 
foresight, appearance and forti- 
tude to court and wed Helga, Old 
Man Mikkelsen’s eldest daugh- 
ter. 

Rajcik went aft to the cargo 
hold. Dierdre was carrying tran- 
sistors this time, and microfilm 
books, platinum filaments, sala- 
mis, and other items that could 
not as yet be produced on Mars. 
But the bulk of her space was 
taken by the immense Fahrensen 
Computer. 

Rajcik checked the position- 
ing lines on the monster, exam- 
ined the stays and turnbuckles 
that held it in place, and re- 
turned to the cabin. 

“All in order, Boss,” he report- 
ed to Captain Somers, with the 
smile that only an employer’s 
son-in-law can both manage and 
afford. 

“Mr. Watkins, do you read 
anything?” 

Watkins was at his own instru- 
ment panel. “Not a thing, sir. I’ll 
vouch for every bit of equipment 
in Dierdre .” 

“Very well. How long before 
we reach Point Baker?” 

-“Three minutes, Chief,” Rajcik 
said. 

“Good.” 

39 




The spaceship hung in the 
void, all sensation of speed lost 
for lack of a reference point Be- 
yond the portholes was darkness, 
the true color of the Universe, 
perforated by the brilliant lost 
points of the stars. 

Captain Somers turned away 
from the disturbing reminder of 
his extreme finitude and won- 
dered if he could land Dierdre 
without shifting the computer. It 
was by far the largest, heaviest 
and most delicate piece of equip- 
ment ever transported in space. 

He worried about that ma- 
chine. Its value ran into the bil- 
lions of dollars, for Mars Colony 
had ordered the best possible, a 
machine whose utility would off- 
set the immense transportation 
charge across space. As a result, 
the Fahrensen Computer was per- 
haps the most complex and ad- 
vanced machine ever built by 
Man. 

“Ten seconds to Point Baker,” 
Rajcik announced. 

“Very well.” Somers readied 
himself at the control board. 

“Four — three — two — one 
—fire!” 

COMERS activated the engines. 
^ Acceleration pressed the three 
men back into their couches, and 
more acceleration, and — shock- 
ingly — still more acceleration. 

“The fuel!” Watkins yelped, 
watching his indicators spinning. 



“The course!” Rajcik gasped, 
fighting for breath. 

Captain Somers cut the engine 
switch. The engines continued 
firing, pressing the men deeper 
into their couches. The cabin 
lights flickered, went out, came 
on again. 

And still the acceleration 
mounted and Dierdre’s engines 
howled in agony, thrusting the 
ship forward. Somers raised one 
leaden hand and inched it to- 
ward the emergency cut - off 
switch. With a fantastic expendi- 
ture of energy, he reached the 
switch, depressed it. 

The engines stopped with dra- 
matic suddenness, while tortured 
metal creaked and groaned. The 
lights flickered rapidly, as though 
Dierdre were blinking in pain. 
They steadied and then there was 
silence. 

Watkins hurried to the engine 
room. He returned morosely. 

“Of all the damn things,” he 
muttered. 

“What was it?” Captain Som- 
ers asked. 

“Main firing circuit. It fused 
on us.” He shook his head. “Metal 
fatigue, I’d say. It must have 
been flawed for years.” 

“When was it last checked 
out?” 

“Well, it’s a sealed unit. Sup- 
posed to outlast the ship. Abso- 
lutely foolproof, unless — ” 

“Unless it’s flawed.” 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Don’t blame it on me! Those 
circuits are supposed to be X- 
rayed, heat-treated, fluoroscoped 
— you just can’t trust machin- 
ery!” 

At last Watkins believed that 
engineering axiom. 

“How are we on fuel?” Captain 
Somers asked. 

“Not enough left to push a 
kiddy car down Main Street,” 
Watkins said gloomily. “If I could 
get my hands on that factory in- 
spector . .” 

Captain Somers turned to Raj- 
cik, who was seated at the navi- 
gator’s desk, hunched over his 
charts. “How does this affect our 
course?” 

Rajcik finished the computa- 
tion he was working on and 
gnawed thoughtfully at his pen- 
cil. 

“It kills us. We’re going to 
cross the orbit of Mars before 
Mars gets there.” 

“How long before?’ 

“Too long. Captain, we’re fly- 
ing out of the Solar System like 
the proverbial bat out of hell.” 

R AJCIK smiled, a courageous, 
devil-may-care smile which 
Watkins found singularly inap- 
propriate. 

“Damn it, man,” he roared, 
“don’t just leave it there. We’ve 
got a little fuel left. We can turn 
her, can’t we? You are a naviga- 
tor, aren’t you?” 



“I am,” Rajcik said icily. “And 
if I computed my courses the 
way you maintain your engines, 
we’d be plowing through Austra- 
lia now.” 

“Why, you little company 
toady! At least I got my job le- 
gitimately, not by marrying—” 

“That’s enough!” Captain Som- 
ers cut in. 

Watkins, his face a mottled red, 
his mustache bristling, looked like 
a walrus about to charge. And 
Rajcik, eyes glittering, was wait- 
ing hopefully. 

“No more of this,” Somers said. 
“I give the orders here.” 

“Then give some!” Watkins 
snapped. “Tell him to plot a re- 
turn curve. This is life or death!” 

“All the more reason for re- 
maining cool. Mr. Rajcik, can 
you plot such a course?” 

“First thing I tried,” Rajcik 
said. “Not a chance, on the fuel 
we have left. We can turn a de- 
gree or two, but it won’t help.” 

Watkins said, “Of course it will! 
We’ll curve back into the Solar 
System!” 

“Sure, but the best curve we 
can make will take a few thou- 
sand years for us to complete." 

“Perhaps a landfall on some 
other planet — Neptune, Ura- 
nus — ” 

Rajcik shook his head. “Even 
if an outer planet were in the 
right place at the right time, we’d 
need fuel- — a lot of fuel — to get 



DEATH WISH 



41 




into a braking orbit. And if we 
could, who’d come get us? No 
ship has gone past Mars yet.” 

“At least we’d have a chance,” 
Watkins said. 

“Maybe,” Rajcik agreed indif- 
ferently. “But we can’t swing it. 
I’m afraid you’ll have to kiss the 
Solar System good-by.” 

Captain Somers wiped his fore- 
head and tried to think of a plan. 
He found it difficult to concen- 
trate. There was too great a dis- 
crepancy between his knowledge 
of the situation and its appear- 
ance. He knew — intellectually — 
that his ship was traveling out of 
the Solar System at a tremendous 
rate of speed. But in appearance 
they were stationary, hung in the 
abyss, three men trapped in a 
small, hot room, breathing the 
smell of hot metal and perspira- 
tion. 

“What shall we do, Captain?” 
Watkins asked. 

COMERS frowned at the engi- 
^ neer. Did the man expect him 
to pull a solution out of the air? 
How was he even supposed to 
concentrate on the problem? He 
had to slow the ship, turn it. But 
his senses told him that the ship 
was not moving. How, then, could 
speed constitute a problem? 

He couldn’t help but feel that 
the real problem was to get away 
from these high-strung, squab- 
bling men, to escape from this 

42 



hot, smelly little room. 

“Captain! You must have sopie 
idea!” 

Somers tried to shake his feel- 
ing of unreality. The problem, 
the real problem,' he told him- 
self, was how to stop the ship. 

He looked around the fixed cab- 
in and out the porthole at the 
unmoving stars. We are moving 
very rapidly, he thought, uncon- 
vinced. 

Rajcik said disgustedly, “Our 
noble captain can’t face the situ- 
ation.” 

“Of course I can,” Somers ob- 
jected, feeling very light-headed 
and unreal. “I can pilot any course 
you lay down. That’s my only 
real responsibility. Plot us a 
course to Mars!” 

“Sure!” Rajcik said, laughing. 
“I can! I will! Engineer, I’m going 
to need plenty of fuel for this 
course — about ten tons! See that 
I get it!” 

“Right you are,” said Watkins. 
“Captain, I’d like to put in a req- 
uisition for ten tons of fuel.” 

“Requisition granted,” Somers 
said. “All right, gentlemen, re- 
sponsibility is inevitably circular. 
Let’s get a grip on ourselves. Mr. 
Rajcik, suppose you radio Mars.” 

When contact had been estab- 
lished, Somers took the micro- 
phone and stated their situation. 
The company official at the other 
end seemed to have trouble 
grasping it. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“But can’t you turn the ship?” 
he asked bewilderedly. “Any kind 
of an orbit — ” 

“No. I’ve just explained that.” 

“Then what do you propose to 
do, Captain?” 

“That’s exactly what I’m ask- 
ing you.” 

There was a babble of voices 
from the loudspeaker, punctuated 
by bursts of static. The lights 
flickered and reception began to 
fade. Rajcik, working frantically, 
managed to re-establish the con- 
tact. 

“Captain,” the official on Mars 
said, “we can’t think of a thing. 
If you could swing into any sort 
of an orbit — ” 

“I can’t!” 

“Under the circumstances, you 
have the right to try anything at 
all. Anything, Captain!” 

Somers groaned. “Listen, I can 
think of just one thing. We could 
bail out in spacesuits as near 
Mars as possible. Link ourselves 
together, take the portable trans- 
mitter. It wouldn’t give much of 
a signal, but you’d know our ap- 
proximate position. Everything 
would have to be figured pretty 
closely — those suits just carry 
twelve hours’ air — but it’s a 
chance.” 

T^HERE was a confusion of 
-*■ voices from the other end. 
Then the official said, “I’m sorry, 
Captain.” 



“What? I’m telling you it’s our 
one chance!” 

“Captain, the only ship on Mars 
now is the Diana. Her engines 
are being overhauled.” 

“How long before she can be 
spaceborne?” 

“Three weeks, at least And a 
ship from Earth would take too 
long. Captain, I wish we could 
think of something. About the 
only thing we can suggest — •” 

The reception suddenly failed 
again. 

Rajcik cursed frustratedly as 
he worked over the radio. Wat- 
kins gnawed at his mustache. 
Somers glanced out a porthole 
and looked hurriedly away, for 
the stars, their destination, were 
impossibly distant. 

They heard static again, faintly 
now. 

“I can’t get much more,” Raj- 
cik said. “This damned reception 
. What could they have been 
* suggesting?” 

“Whatever it was,” said Wat- 
kins, “they didn’t think it would 
work.” 

“What the hell does that mat- 
ter?” Rajcik asked, annoyed. “It'd 
give us something to do.” 

They heard the official’s voice, 
a whisper across space. 

“Can you hear ... Suggest . .” 

At full amplification, the voice 
faded, then returned. “Can only 
suggest . most unlikely . but 
try . calculator . try . .” 



DEATH WISH 



43 




The voice was gone. And then 
even the static was gone. 

“That does it,” Rajcik said. 
“The calculator? Did he mean the 
Fahrensen Computer in our 
hold?” 

“I see what he meant,” said 
Captain Somers. “The Fahrensen 
is a very advanced job. No one 
knows the limits of its potential. 
He suggests we present our prob- 
lem to it.” 

“That’s ridiculous,” Watkins 
snorted. “This problem has no so- 
lution.” 

“It doesn’t seem to,’.’ Somers 
agreed. “But the big computers 
have solved other apparently im- 
possible problems. We can’t lose 
anything by trying,” 

“No,” said Rajcik, “as long as 
we don’t pin any hopes on it.” 

“That’s right. We don’t dare 
hope. Mr. Watkins, I believe this 
is your department.” 

“Oh, what’s the use?” Watkins 
asked. “You say don’t hope — but 
both of you are hoping anyhow! 
You think the big electronic god 
is going to save your lives. Well, 
it’s not!” 

“We have to try,” Somers told 
him. 

“We don’t! I wouldn’t give it 
the satisfaction of turning us 
down!” 

fT'HEY stared at him in vacant 
astonishment. 

“Now you’re implying that ma- 



chines think,” said Rajcik. 

“Of course I am,” Watkins said. 
“Because they do! No, I’m not 
out of my head. Any engineer will 
tell you that a complex machine 
has a personality all its own. Do 
you know what that personality 
is like? Cold, withdrawn, uncar- 
ing, unfeeling. A machine’s only 
purpose is to frustrate desire and 
produce two problems for every 
one it solves. And do you know 
why a machine feels this way?” 

“You’re hysterical,” Somers 
told him. 

“I am not. A machine feels 
this way because it knows it is 
an unnatural creation in nature’s 
domain. Therefore it wishes to 
reach entropy and cease — a me- 
chanical death wish.” 

“I’ve never heard such gibber- 
ish in my life,” Somers said. “Are 
you going to hook up that com- 
puter?” 

“Of course. I’m a human. I 
keep trying. I just wanted you to 
understand fully that there is no 
hope.” He went to the cargo hold. 

After he had gone, Rajcik 
grinned and shook his head. “We’d 
better watch him.” 

“He’ll be all right,” Somers 
said. 

“Maybe, maybe not.” Rajcik 
pursed his lips thoughtfully. “He’s 
blaming the situation on a ma- 
chine personality now, trying to 
absolve himself of guilt. And it 
is his fault that we’re in this spot. 



DEATH WISH 



45 




An engineer is responsible for all 
equipment.” 

“I don’t believe you can put 
the blame on him so dogmati- 
cally,” Somers replied. 

“Sure I can,” Rajcik said. “I 
personally don’t care, though. 
This is as good a way to die as 
any other and better than most.” 

Captain Somers wiped perspi- 
ration from his face. Again the 
notion came to him that the prob- 
lem — the real problem — was 
to find a way out of this hot, 
smelly, motionless little box. 

Rajcik said, “Death in space 
is an appealing idea, in certain 
ways. Imagine an entire space- 
ship for your tomb! And you have 
a variety of ways of actually dy- 
ing. Thirst and starvation I rule 
out as unimaginative. But there 
are possibilities in heat, cold, im- 
plosion, explosion — ” 

“This is pretty morbid,” Som- 
ers said. 

46¥’M A pretty morbid fellow,” 
Rajcik said carelessly. “But 
at least I’m not blaming inani- 
mate objects, the way Watkins 
is. Or permitting myself the lux- 
ury of shock, like you.” He stud- 
ied Somers’ face. “This is your 
first real emergency, isn’t it, Cap- 
tain?” 

“I suppose so,” Somers an- 
swered vaguely. 

“And you’re responding to it 
like a stunned ox,” Rajcik said. 

46 



“Wake up, Captain! If you can’t 
live with joy, at least try to ex- 
tract some pleasure from your 
dying.” 

“Shut up,” Somers said, with 
no heat. “Why don’t you read a 
book or something?” 

“I’ve read all the books on 
board. I have nothing to distract 
me except an analysis of your 
character.” 

Watkins returned to the cabin. 
“Well, I’ve activated your big 
electronic god. Would anyone 
care to make a burned offering 
in front of it?” 

“Have you given it the prob- 
lem?” 

“Not yet. I decided to confer 
with the high priest. What shall 
I request of the demon, sir?” 

“Give it all the data you can,” 
Somers said. “Fuel, oxygen, wa- 
ter, food — that sort of thing. 
Then tell it we want to return to 
Earth. Alive,” he added 

“It’ll love that,” Watkins said. 
“It’ll get such pleasure out of re- 
jecting our problem as unsolv- 
able. Or better yet — insufficient 
data. In that way, it can hint 
that a solution is possible, but just 
outside our reach. It can keep us 
hoping.” 

Somers and Rajcik followed 
him to the cargo hold. The com- 
puter, activated now, hummed 
softly. Lights flashed swiftly over 
its panels, blue and white and 
red. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Watkins punched buttons and 
turned dials for fifteen minutes, 
then moved back. 

“Watch for the red light on 
top,” he said. “That means the 
problem is rejected.” 

“Don’t say it,” Rajcik warned 
quickly. 

Watkins laughed. “Supersti- 
tious little fellow, aren’t you?” 

“But not incompetent,” Rajcik 
said, smiling. 

“Can’t you two quit it?” Som- 
ers demanded, and both men 
turned startedly to face him. 

“Behold!” Rajcik said. “The 
sleeper has awakened.” 

“After a fashion,” said Watkins, 
snickering. 

Somers suddenly felt that if 
death or rescue did not come 
quickly, they would kill each 
other, or drive each other crazy. 

“Look!” Rajcik said. 

A LIGHT on the computer’s 
*"*• panel was flashing green. 

“Must be a mistake,” said Wat- 
kins. “Green means the problem 
is solvable within the conditions 
set down.” 

“Solvable!” Rajcik said. 

“But it’s impossible,” Watkins 
argued. “It’s fooling us, leading 
us on — ” 

“Don’t be superstitious,” Raj- 
cik mocked. “How soon do we get 
the solution?” 

“It’s coming now.” Watkins 
pointed to a paper tape inching 



out of a slot in the machine’s 
face. “But there must be some- 
thing wrong!” 

They watched as, millimeter 
by millimeter, the tape crept out. 
The computer hummed, its lights 
flashing green. Then the hum 
stopped. The green lights blazed 
once more and faded. 

“What happened?” Rajcik 
wanted to know. 

“It’s finished,” Watkins said. 

“Pick it up! Read it!” 

“You read it. You won’t get me 
to play its game.” 

Rajcik laughed nervously and 
rubbed his hands together, but 
didn’t move. Both men turned 
to Somers. 

“Captain, it’s your responsibil- 
ity.” 

“Go ahead, Captain!” 

Somers looked with loathing at 
his engineer and navigator. His 
responsibility, everything was his 
responsibility. Would they never 
leave him alone? 

He went up to the machine, 
pulled the tape free, read it with 
slow deliberation. 

“What does it say, sir?” Rajcik 
asked. 

“Is it — possible?” Watkins 
urged. 

“Oh, yes,” Somers said. “It’s 
possible.” He laughed and looked 
around at the hot, smelly, low- 
ceilinged little room with its 
locked doors and windows. 

“What is it?” Rajcik shouted. 



DEATH WISH 



47 




S OMERS said, “You figured a 
few thousand years to return 
to the Solar System, Rajcik? 
Well, the computer agrees with 
you. Twenty-three hundred years, 
to be precise. Therefore, it has 
given us a suitable longevity 
serum.” 

“Twenty-three hundred years,” 
Rajcik mumbled. “I suppose we 
hibernate or something of the 
sort.” 

“Not at all,” Somers said calm- 



ly. “As a matter of fact, this se- 
rum does away quite nicely with 
the need for sleep. We stay awake 
and watch each other.” 

The three men looked at one 
another and at the sickeningly 
familiar room smelling of metal 
and perspiration, its sealed doors 
and windows that stared at an 
unchanging spectacle of stars. 

Watkins said, “Yes, that’s the 
sort of thing it would do,”

OF THE IRON HORSE 



I N THE days of the Second 
World War, when every old 
ax blade and every rusty

George Bennie's experimental monorail 
track with station, photographed in 1930 



worked hard and with top prior- 
ity on the repair of a bomb-dam- 
aged structure of almost the same 
kind in a city in West Germany 
in the British Zone of Occupation. 

Both the structure that was dis- 
mantled in England and the one 
that was repaired in Germany 
were monorail tracks, the only 
ones in the world. They were not 
completely alike, but the main 
difference was not one of con- 
struction. 

The most important difference 
was that the one in England was 
experimental and had been built 

50 



for purposes of testing and dem- 
onstration, while the one in Ger- 
many was and is a hard-working 
part of the city’s public transpor- 
tation system, the city being El- 
berfeld-Barmen. It has been ever 
since it was built in 1900 and its 
history, except for the bomb dam- 
age sustained during the Second 
World War, is happily devoid of 
any dramatic incident. It simply 
worked from the first day on and, 
through all these years, it was a 
unique offshoot of the iron horse. 
There was no other like it. 

But it is quite probable that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



one day in the future, the pas- 
senger-carrying monorail of El- 
berfeld - Barmen will not be 
unique any more. It will then be 
the oldest example of a special 
and very useful means of trans- 
portation. And it is also likely 
that the newer examples will owe 
their existence and usefulness to 
a premeditated disregard of the 
principles that guided the design 
and construction of the first. 

T THINK the story will emerge 

best when told in proper chron- 
ological order. The city of Elber- 
feld-Barmen was originally two 
cities, Elberfeld and Barmen, both 
situated some distance apart on 
the banks of a fairly small river, 
the Wupper, which is a tributary 
of the Rhine River. The valley of 
the Wupper River was in the cen- 
ter of what was to become one of 
the most heavily industrialized 
sections of all Europe. 

Even before the turn of the 
century, the traffic situation of 
the whole area had become very 
nearly unmanageable. And the 
neighboring cities of Elberfeld 
and Barmen were in an especially 
difficult spot. As almost always 
happens — npbody knows why — 
people living in one city had jobs 
in the other. Local traffic was 
heavy and, in addition to the lo- 
cal traffic, there was a good deal 
of through traffic. 

In both cities, the streets were 

MUTANT OF THE IRON HORSE 



generally old and rather narrow 
and by no means straight. The 
Imperial Railroad bought what 
rights of way it needed and, in 
time, took care of much of the 
through traffic. The local traffic 
problem still remained to be 
solved. 

An engineer from Cologne, by 
the name of Eugen Langen, 
pointed out to the harassed city 
officials of both cities that there 
was something that might be 
called open space between the 
two cities, namely the Wupper 
River. One might build an ele- 
vated railroad running over the 
river, without hampering the 
river traffic itself. 

Eugen Langen probably was 
not the first to think of this, but 
if others had harbored the same 
idea before him, they had given 
up, for the river does not happen 
to be very straight, either. No 
elevated railroad, if circumstances 
forced it to stay over the river, 
could follow all its twists and 
turns and run at a speed faster 
than a brisk walk. The answer, 
presented by Langen, was a type 
of railroad which could follow 
the twists and bends and still run 
at a reasonable speed. 

He evolved a structure resem- 
bling a steel-girder bridge run- 
ning the length of the river, with 
supports looking like inverted 
“V”s, planted into the banks of 
the river. This structure supported 



51 




two single rails and the trains 
were suspended from these rails. 
Each car hung from so-called 
bogies and each bogie had two 
wheels, one behind the other, 
which rested on the single rails. 
In each bogie, the front wheel 
was the driving wheel with an 
electric motor, while the second 
wheel merely trailed. The cur- 
rent for the driving wheels was 
furnished in the same manner 
as for any other electric train. 

Naturally, a car hanging from 
bogies could take rather sharp 
turns fairly fast in perfect safety. 
The name given to the new de- 
vice was Schwebebahn, which 
might be translated nearly liter- 
ally as “levitated railroad,” but is 
usually referred to in English en- 
gineering literature as the Wup- 
pertal Monorail. 

COME twenty-five years after 
^ its completion, somebody 
wrote a paper proving conclusive- 
ly that the structure must be un- 
safe, since it should collapse un- 
der its own weight. At the time 
this was written, the Schwebe- 
bahn had a record of having han- 
dled 4200 passengers per hour in 
each direction ever since it was 
opened to the public. It obviously 
was far less unsafe than the critic 
had calculated. Whoever was in 
charge then modified operations 
somewhat, however. Instead of 
three-car trains, which had been 

52 



customary, the Monorail ran only 
two-car trains, but more of them. 

Since the stations are spaced 
rather closely together, the speed 
of this monorail is never very 
high. Its function, and consequent- 
ly its speed, might best be com- 
pared to a fairly fast streetcar 
line operating under ideal traffic 
conditions, with nobody else ever 
getting in the way. 

The Wuppertal Monorail has 
shown that such a transportation 
system has definite advantages in 
crowded areas because it can pro- 
vide urban mass transportation 
without taking up any space on 
the ground worth mentioning. It 
is with just this thought in mind 
that there have been sporadic 
studies of a monorail project for 
southern California. 

This monorail, if built, would 
be a suburban rapid transit — 
let’s say fairly rapid — line run- 
ning from the center of Los An- 
geles to Van Nuys in the San 
Fernando Valley, a distance of 
18 miles. Instead of following a 
river, the San Fernando Valley 
Monorail would follow a pro- 
posed freeway and it would look 
different for this reason. Instead 
of being supported by inverted 
“V”s, the rails would be supported 
by T-shaped girders which would 
be imbedded in the center-park 
strip of the freeway. 

As in the example of the Wup- 
pertal Monorail, the San Fernan- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




do Valley Monorail is to have 
electric drive and the cars are to 
be suspended from two bogies 
apiece, each bogie with two 
wheels. But in the new proposal, 
every bogie wheel is supposed to 
be a driving wheel, equipped with 
an electric motor of 55 horse- 
power, which would result in a 
maximum speed (this is purely 
a coincidence of figures) of 55 
m.p.h. No higher speeds are pos- 
sible under the circumstances be- 
cause of economic spacing of the 
stations. 

For the sake of passengers, es- 
pecially standees, acceleration 
and deceleration of the cars must 
not surpass a maximum of six 
feet per second squared, and this 
would imply a spacing of stations 
a minimum of 5 miles apart if one 
wanted to reach 100 m.p.h. be- 
tween stations. 

The most important talking 
point of the advocates of mono- 
rail systems is, of course, safety, 
for which the Wuppertal Mono- 
rail has produced a most impres- 
sive record. 

A suspended monorail cannot 
be derailed except by difficult 
and highly ingenious sabotage. 
The rails cannot possibly be 
flooded. No snow can accumulate 
on the rails, although this consid- 
eration, of course, does not apply 
to sunny California. No driver, 
however reckless or careless, can 
stall his car on the track. 



The second talking point is 
that, in this particular case, 
where a rapid transit line has to 
be built in a heavily populated 
area, a monorail would be cheap- 
er than a surface railroad. 

I N AUGUST, 1947, the Metro- 
politan Traffic and Transit 
Committee of the Los Angeles 
Chamber of Commerce completed 
a study of what it would cost to 
build a double-track surface rail- 
road in the center of the freeway. 
This, of course, meant widening 
the freeway and buying some 
right-of-way for the purpose. The 
final figure read that this double 
track railroad would cost $1,165,- 
000 per mile. 

But that was only for the wid- 
ened freeway and the roadbed. 
There would be additional ex- 
penses for tracks, stations, signal 
systems and, naturally, the trains 
themselves. 

The monorail along the same 
route would cost $834,000 per 
mile, including structures, signal 
system, car yard, repair shops 
and eight intermediate stations. 
This figure of $834,000 per mile 
included everything but the cost 
of the terminal station and the 
price of the rolling stock. 

Interesting — but how about 
that other monorail structure the 
English used up for scrap during 
the Second World War? 

Well, that one, though also a 



MUTANT OF THE IRON HORSE

The Doppersberg station of the Wuppertal monorail in Elberfeld 



monorail, is something from an 
entirely different chapter of the 
same book, maybe even a chapter 
from a different book. To under- 
stand it, we have to go back to 
early entries in the story of the 
iron horse. 

When the first locomotives 
were in what would now be 
called the planning stage, a few 
people who had learned mathe- 
matics severely lectured the in- 
ventors on their lack of mathe- 
matical knowledge. 

A rail, they said, is a straight 
line. A wheel is a circle. A loco- 
motive wheel on a rail is, mathe- 
matically speaking, a circle and 
a tangent. As everybody knows, 

54 



a circle and a tangent touch in 
just one point. Therefore no car 
could possibly be moved by ap- 
plying force to its wheels. Since 
wheel and track touched in one 
point only, there could not pos- 
sibly be enough friction to move 
the vehicle. The wheel, in all 
probability, would merely spin. 

A few inventors took this in- 
formation to heart and came up 
with “designs” in which the 
wheels were cogwheels fitting a 
notched rail — or else in which 
all wheels were all freely spinning 
and the motion was to be ac- 
complished by pushing rods en- 
gaging either the cross ties of the 
tracks or else the ground directly. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The latter type had imitation 
horse feet at the end of the push 
rods! But some people just built 
locomotives and found out that, 
tangent to the circle notwith- 
standing, they got enough trac- 
tion not only to move the loco- 
motive but to make it pull a 
train, too. 

tTROM then on, traction on the 
rails was taken for granted 
and the railroads grew rapidly, in 
numbers, size and in weight. As 
a matter of fact, they grew too 
much in weight. Rolling stock 
was built to last and if it grew

heavy in the process, well, that 
was the way things were. Around 
1900, a good solidly built passen- 
ger car in which every seat was 
occupied weighed just three per 
cent more than the same car 
without any passengers! 

Every once in a while, some- 
body noticed this obvious in- 
efficiency and made suggestions 
for lightweight trains. He was 
then either told that durability 
was the most important consid- 
eration or was suspected of being 
a camouflaged salesman for an 
aluminum company. Only recent- 
ly have lightweight trains actual- 
ly appeared on the scene, but 
they are still rare. 

In the meantime, imaginative 
engineers had gone a step further 
in their reasoning. Except for 
heavy freight engines, where 
their great weight was useful 
when it came to traction, there 
was no need or reason for ineffi- 
cient overweight in rolling stock. 
One should, therefore, use all the 
tricks of the trade to lighten the 
cars. It would then, obviously, 
take much less power to move a 
car. And with lessened power re- 
quirements, one could think of 
engines other than the steam en- 
gine. 

Moreover, why rely on traction 
of turning wheels? Airplanes mov- 
ing around on the ground moved 
on wheels, but no wheel traction 
was involved. Why not investi-

gate whether an airplane propel- 
ler might not furnish the motive 
power for wheeled vehicles, too? 

It turned out after the First 
World War that several engineers 
had secretly toyed with this idea 
for years. But it also turned out 
that the first propeller-driven 
railroad car had been built in a 
most unprofessional manner. 

The year was 1917 and the 
place was Palestine. A contingent 
of German soldiers stationed 
there found the climate too warm 
for their taste, but fortunately 
the shore of the Mediterranean 



Sea was only a little more than 
a mile away. Unfortunately, how- 
ever, they had to walk that mile, 
though there was a railroad track. 
There also was a flatcar but no 
locomotive. 

Then somebody looked spec- 
ulatively at a wrecked airplane. 
Its propeller was undamaged, its 
engine in running condition. No 
harm in taking the engine out of 
the wrecked plane and mounting 
it on the flatcar. Maybe it would 
work. 

It did.

example, a German scientist who 
had been in charge of propeller 
production and testing (for air- 
ships) through the war advocat- 
ed, in 1918, that available rail- 
road cars and available aircraft 
engines should be put together as 
emergency propeller-driven rail- 
roads. The scientist was Dr. Otto 
Steinitz, who had devoted some 
spare time to the problem of pro- 
peller-driven trackbound vehicles 
for several years. 

The reason he publicly advo- 
cated his ideas at that particular 
time was that he believed that 
such emergency vehicles would 
help to return German soldiers 
home after the Armistice had 
been signed. Theoretically, the 
months just following a revolu- 
tion may be the proper psycho- 
logical time for advocating new 
ideas in other fields, too. In real- 
ity, nothing happens as a rule, if 
only because of the lack of means. 

At any event, the Germans fi- 
nally got their soldiers home 
without taking advantage of Dr. 
Steinitz’s suggestion. 

B UT the proper sub-section in 
the Office of the Federal Rail- 
roads of the Ministry of Trans- 
portation was interested and a 
single car was built. It wasn’t 
built quite the way Dr. Steinitz 
wanted it. The chief engineer of 
this particular railroad shop con- 
sidered it a rather extreme case 



of lunacy that Dr. Steinitz wanted 
ball bearings; who had ever heard 
of a railroad car running on ball 
bearings? Dr. Steinitz lost this 
particular battle. The same man 
also could not see why the front 
end of the car should not be 
square. 

Dr. Steinitz had stated that he 
wanted the front end of the car 
to look “somewhat like the stem 
of a ship.” The man in charge of 
the actual building decided that 
one did not build pointed railroad 
cars; it just wasn’t done. After 
much complaining, a kind of com- 
promise was reached. 

It was not very good, but the 
completed vehicle did work. It 
passed a test run with flying col- 
ors in May, 1919. It made a run 
with the railroad committee of 
the National Assembly on board. 
It pulled a trailer; by chance, only 
the heaviest type of freight car 
happened to be available to serve 
as a trailer on that day. But the 
propeller car pulled it just the 
same. 

Then, after a number of non- 
committal statements had been 
issued, it ran for a year around 
freight yards in Berlin, doing odd 
jobs of moving freight over short 
distances, even though Dr. Stein- 
itz had stated over and over 
again that the propeller drive for 
trackbound vehicles would work 
most efficiently for long runs at 
rather high speeds and that the

propeller drive was not good for 
stop-and-go driving. 

The German railroads had to 
replace most of their rolling 
stock, which had been worn out 
in four years of war with contin- 
uous duty and little maintenance. 
But they built conventional 
equipment. No lightweight rolling 
stock. And certainly no propeller 
drive. 

More than ten years later, an- 
other engineer by the name of 
Krukenberg succeeded in per- 
suading the railroad office to build 
him a streamlined (and light- 
weight) test car with a pusher 
propeller. It made several runs 
between Berlin and Hamburg at 

58 



record speeds and became the fa- 
vorite subject of newspaper and 
newsreel photographers. 

And then there came an official 
statement that propeller - driven 
railroad cars were “not yet prac- 
tical.” 

^T^HE next step was taken by 
the Scotsman George Bennie 
in putting together the propeller 
drive and the monorail. 

Many of the objections, some 
silly, some justified, that had 
been brought forth against pro- 
peller drive for surface vehicles 
became automatically invalid 
when applied to overhead mono- 
rails. And the propeller drive, on 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the other hand, greatly simplified 
the construction of the monorail 
car. The wheels in the bogies no 
longer had to be powered and 
the problem of current supply 
and current pickup along the line 
could be eliminated by having 
the propeller driven by an air- 
plane type engine running on avi- 
ation gasoline. 

George Bennie was in the for- 
tunate position of being able to 
do more than write articles about 
his project and publish detailed 
drawings. In 1929, he built a 
750-foot test section of monorail 
track, complete with a station 
and a propeller-driven car. And 
he predicted as a result of both 
calculations and tests that a pro- 
peller-driven monorail ought to 
be able to reach speeds of 200 
m.p.h. This sounded pretty far- 



fetched at the time, but he may 
very well have been conservative 
in his prediction. 

Of course the propeller-driven 
monorail is something entirely 
different from the bogie-wheel- 
driven type in action over the 
Wupper River and under study 
for the San Fernando Valley. 
There the goal is reasonably fast 
transit for rfiany passengers be- 
tween closely spaced stations. 

The propeller-driven monorail 
is a means of really rapid transit 
for large passenger loads in any 
kind of weather over fairly long 
distances, with stations spaced 
widely apart. Just what the spac- 
ing of the stations will be and to 
what overall range monorail sys- 
tems might be expanded will de- 
pend entirely on local conditions, 
on actual transportations needs.

Ideally, for high speeds and ef- 
ficient operation, the stops should 
be at least 15 miles apart, while 
the total length of a run may be 
200 miles. Above distances of 
200 miles, especially if they are 
to be traveled non-stop, the air- 
plane begins to assert its superi- 
ority. 

But within the 200-mile range 
in congested areas, the only pos- 
sible competitor in terms of speed 
would be the large helicopter — 
the bus-type helicopter. Not be- 
ing trackbound, it is more flexible 
than a monorail, but it is not as 
independent of local weather con- 
ditions. And its fuel consumption 
per ton/mile of payload flown is 
much higher, of course, probably 
about ten times as high because 
airborne equipment has to lift 
the physical payload in addition 
to moving it. 

Strange as it may seem at first 
glance, the traffic density on a 
rigidly proscribed track can com- 
pete with that in the apparently 
boundless atmosphere. The heli- 
copters could fly at many differ- 
ent levels, but at some time they 
have to land in a specific place, 
which is the place where a con- 
gestion might occur. 

A S LONG as a discussion like 
this one deals with techno- 
logical problems like speed ver- 
sus fuel consumption, passenger- 
carrying capacity over a given 

60 



route for a specific time interval, 
and safety of operations in vari- 
ous kinds of assumed weather, 
you are on reasonably firm 
ground. But when it comes to fi- 
nancial aspects, such firm foun- 
dation for thinking seems to van- 
ish more often than not. I don’t 
know the reasons; I just remem- 
ber examples from the past. 

At one time, a railroad had to 
go around mountains. It had to 
do that — or so it was stated — 
because drilling a tunnel through 
a mountain would cost far too 
much, provided it was possible at 
all. 

At some other time, somebody 
showed why the automobile 
would always remain a city vehi- 
cle. The reason was so simple 
that a child could understand it. 
To travel in an automobile from 
one city to another would require 
a road of exceptional quality, a 
quality comparable to a city 
street. Naturally such roads could 
be built, but hundreds of miles of 
such roads would cost so much 
that the public simply could not 
afford them. 

To discuss the probable cost 
of a monorail system is, there- 
fore, a very difficult undertaking 
and a general comparison of costs 
between monorail, railroad, su- 
perhighway and helibus line 
would quickly turn into science 
fiction. A- real answer can be giv- 
en only after a specialized and 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




thorough study of one particular 
route, as was made in the case of' 
the San Fernando Valley project. 
There the financial superiority of 
the monorail was extreme, to put 
it mildly, because of the rights of 
way that had to be bought in an 
area where they are expensive. 

■p|ISTANCE alone is certainly 
no guide : Chicago to Peoria, 
Illinois; San Antonio to Corpus 
Christi, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia, 
to Birmingham, Alabama; Taco- 
ma, Washington, to Portland, Or- 
egon; Burbank, California, to San 
Diego; and Providence, Rhode 
Island, to Newark, New Jersey, 
are all about the same milage as 
the Piper Cub flies. But even as- 
suming equal transportation de- 
mands — which is certainly wrong 
— the cost of construction of any 
connecting trackage would vary 
enormously from place to place, 
without counting the cost of right 
of way. 

Among the places just quoted, 
the Chicago to Peoria line proba- 
bly has the flattest country. 
There a double-track monorail 
structure might cost more than 
a double-track railroad. But once 
you deal with country that is not 
flat, the surface rail line encoun- 
ters expensive items such as grad- 
ing, cutting through hills, cross- 
ing rivers and creeks and similar 
vagaries of nature. 

The monorail encounters the 

MUTANT OF THE IRON HORSE 



same natural features, but in the 
vast majority of cases, the struc- 
ture can neutralize them by the 
simple expedient of lengthening 
or shortening the supports. It is 
just the type of structure that 
can cope with difficult territory. 

Moreover, it is just the type 
of vehicle that would be useful 
for serving an airport which is a 
score of miles from the city to 
which it belongs. 

In short, it is the means for 
really fast ground transportation 
and it accomplishes this feat by 
raising the vehicles a little off the 
ground — truly a mutant of the 
iron horse.

Who would not have pity for a

Illustrated by WEISS 



T HE OLD GUY didn’t have 
a chance. All he could do 
was shield his head with 
limp arms and moan, while this 
other fellow — a young, husky 
six-footer — gave him a vicious, 
cold-blooded beating. 

“Hey, there!” I yelled indig- 
nantly. “Cut it out!” 

But the kid kept belting away, 
as if he were methodically work- 
ing out on a fifty-pound training 
bag. Finally, the old man sagged 



to the pavement. Then this hood- 
lum began to kick him. 

I’m not a hero. I’m a news- 
paper man whose job it is to look 
at things objectively. But I know 
right from wrong. 

My one punch caught the 
young bruiser back of the ear 
and spilled him on the ground. 
He lay there for a moment, then 
rolled over. Even by the street 
light, it was easy to see his eyes 
were glassy.

It gave me lots of satisfaction. 
Tm not a big man — just com- 
pact — but I take care of myself. 
I don’t drink or smoke and I 
exercise regularly. The result is 
I can handle myself in the 
clinches. 

The kid sat up and pushed 
himself unsteadily to his feet. I 
could see now that he was a col- 
lege boy. The red sweater with 
the terrycloth border and the 
white pants with a shortened 
left leg were a dead giveaway. 

“Listen here,” I said roughly, 
“you nuts? Beating up an old 
man!” 

He appeared to be desperately 
searching for an explanation — 
something to say. Then, abruptly, 
without having uttered a sound, 
he reeled away and shambled 
hurriedly down the street. 

My first inclination was to 
give chase. But the old man 
groaned and I turned to help 
him. That was when I had it — 
a virtual brain storm. 

This whole episode, I could 
see, was a perfect answer to the 
damnable criticisms leveled at 
my series on juvenile delin- 
quency. More than that, it was 
an absolute vindication! 

B ARELY AN hour ago, I’d had 
to sit at a meeting and take 
it on the chin from twenty of 
the town’s leading lights who 
designated themselves The Com- 



mittee for the Protection of 
Youth. The outfit was, of course, 
politically inspired. It had obvi- 
ously been started by the Mayor 
and his gang as a means of tor- 
pedoing Jones, the publisher of 
my paper. Jones, you see, had 
become politically ambitious him- 
self. 

Since I was the star on Jones’ 
team, they piled on me. Some of 
the nicer things said about my 
articles were that they consti- 
tuted filthy muckraking, were a 
pattern of irresponsible lies, and 
were designed principally to 
smear the incumbent politicos. 
The children of the town, they 
cried, were being sacrificed to 
ruthless ambition. 

It wouldn’t have been so bad 
if Jones had stuck by me. But he 
cut and ran. Discretion, he had 
whispered to me from behind a 
pudgy hand, was the better part 
of valor. Then he told them he 
would discontinue the articles. 

Now I had first-hand proof of 
a particularly brutal bit of delin- 
quency. A cruel assault on a podr, 
helpless old man! Furthermore, 
I was the hero of the incident! 

Bending down to see how seri- 
ously the old man had been hurt, 
I asked, “What happened, Pop? 
Was he trying to rob you or 
something?” He didn’t answer. 

I looked around for help, but 
the street was deserted. The best 
thing, I decided, was to take him

home. There Nan, my wife, could 
patch him up while I found out 
what had happened. I bent down 
again and pulled him to his feet 
He staggered. I put one steady- 
ing hand on his shoulder and 
gripped his wrist with the other. 
My spine went cold. 

It was his, flesh. Not so much 
that it felt like rubber — but the 
chill. Here we were in the middle 
of a heat wave, the thermometer 
nudging ninety, and the old guy’s 
wrist is like an icicle! 

For a second, it threw me. 
Then I thought of shock. That 
might explain it And Nan, having 
been a nurse, would be the one 
to know. 

I started the old man walking. 
“See if you can make it to my 
house,” I urged. “It’s just around 
the comer.” 

Nan switched on the porch 
light when she heard us on the 
steps. Opening the door, she drew 
back with a little shriek. The old 
man was pretty gruesome-looking 
at that But it wasn’t just his 
blood-covered face and matted 
white beard. 

There was something spiderish 
about him. He was angular, and 
dark, and skeletal. His eyes, deep- 
set and brooding, seemed to 
crouch under his shaggy, jutting 
brows. 

“Take it easy, honey,” I said. 
“The old guy just needs some 
patching up.” 

THE SCAPEGOAT 



S HE RECOVERED quickly 
and helped him into the 
house. After we’d eased him into 
the easy chair by the fireplace 
in the living room, she turned 
to me, worried. “Were you in an 
accident?” 

I gave her the story and she 
looked at me sharply, but didn’t 
speak. She went into the bed- 
room and came back with blank- 
ets and medicine bottles. Tuck- 
ing the blankets around the old 
man’s legs, she said, “But I don’t 
understand why you were walk- 
ing. You went to the meeting in 
Jones’ car. Why didn’t he bring 
you back?” 

I didn’t answer. The old man 
had closed his eyes and his 
breathing was becoming very 
shallow. “Look at him,” I said. 
“Is he all right?” 

“He’s sleeping. Why don’t you 
answer my question?” 

“Jones didn’t bring me home 
because I had words with him 
and walked away in a huff.” 
“Over the meeting?” 

“Partly.” I explained about the 
meeting and how Jones had back- 
tracked when the going got rough. 
“After all, it was his idea to build 
circulation with sensational arti- 
cles and to use them to attack 
the present administration. But 
when there’s a showdown, he acts 
like a scared rabbit. And that’s 
what I told him.” 

“Fm glad,” Nan said, her face 

65 




brightening. “What did he say to 
that?* 

“He gave me a lot of bull about 
it being a mistake to pick on peo- 
ple’s children and how we should 
stick to old standbys like red- 
light districts and dope traffick- 
ing.” 

Nan slapped the iodine on the 
table. “Some nerve! What did 
you tell him?” 

“I told him he was jerking the 
rug from under me and that I’d 
be damned if I’d write a bunch 
of warmed-over tripe. Then I 
walked away.” 

“You finally quit!” 

Until then, I don’t think I’d 
ever realized just how much Nan 
hated my work. Of course, off 
and on, we’d really had some 
knock-down drag-outs, but I’d 
never considered them serious. 
Oh, we often talked about my 
going into teaching physical ed. 
It had been my intention ever 
since college. Some day I’d actu- 
ally do it. 

I shook my head. “No, honey, 

I didn’t quit.” 

“But you’re going to?” 

I shrugged in a gesture of help- 
lessness. “How can I? An unpro- 
voked attack against a poor old 
man is dynamite. It puts me in 
the driver’s seat. I can write an’ 1 
article that will make every 
mealy-mouthed hypocrite who 
spoke against me tonight eat his 
words.” 



f HE FIRE in her eyes died. 

“It’s always something,” she 
said wearily. “Year after year, 
you’ve come up with one reason 
or another to stay in the rotten 
business. And what does it 
amount to? Mud-slinging! I’m be- 
ginning to think you like it!” 

She’d never come out so blunt- 
ly and, deep down, I felt my re- 
sentment pressing like the sharp 
edge of a coiled spring. Origin- 
ally, getting into the newspaper 
game had been a sort of fluke. 
Majoring in physical ed at col- 
lege, I often covered the various 
sports events for the campus 
paper. One day, a big-time scan- 
dal broke, involving gamblers 
and one of the teams, and I 
found myself in a perfect spot 
to do an exclusive for a city 
paper. My stuff was run verbatim 
under a by-line and afterward 
picked up by the wire services. 

Later, with a trick knee keep- 
ing me out of the war, I managed 
to talk myself into a job with 
the newspaper that had run my 
expose. I was goaded by a feel- 
ing that I ought to be doing some- 
thing bigger than teaching chil- 
dren how to play games. 

From the very start, I discov- 
ered I had a peculiar talent. If 
I found myself anywhere near a 
skeleton in a closet, I could plain- 
ly hear its rattle. Before long, 
my reputation was firmly estab- 
lished.

Nan, whom I’d met at college, 
knew of my ambition to teach 
and began planning toward that 
end as soon as we married. She 
started what she called a quitting 
fund. This was to stake a move 
to a small town where her uncle 
was principal of the high school. 
He was supposed to help me get 
a foothold in the new career. 

But then Tommy was born and 
there were bills to pay. After that 
there were other reasons, like car 
payments. By the end of the war, 
the teaching plans were no longer 
discussed, and Nan and I had 
drawn so far apart that even the 
bickering between us had ceased. 

Finally, when Tommy was 
about ten, she suddenly let me 
have it. 

It seems the kid was running 
around with a tough crowd. She 
wanted to get him away from the 
city. He needed the fresh air and 
the decent, normal home-life of 
a small town, she said. And she 
meant every word of it. 

Luckily, Jones had come along 
right about then and offered me 
a job on his newspaper, back in 
the old home town. He had an 
idea he could drive the opposition 
paper out of business by featur- 
ing yellow journalism at the local 
level. That’s where I came in. 
With my ability to make the 
news bleed, he figured he could 
cinch it. For that reason, he was 
willing to double my present sal- 

THE SCAPEGOAT 



ary. So I accepted. 

Nan, of course, was furious, 
even though I pointed out the 
extra dough meant we could start 
planning again. She didn’t calm 
down until I promised to quit the 
job after six months. 

'V7’ES, IT WAS always some- 
thing. She was right enough 
about that. But she had no right 
to make such an issue of things. 
I started to tell her that, then 
stopped. Maybe she was picking 
a quarrel to make me forget 
about the old man and the story. 
I threw a fast block into my re- 
sentment. 

“Honey,” I said, “don’t be un- 
reasonable. Remember this job 
with Jones was supposed to get 
Tommy away from the city, and 
the extra dough was all part of 
that big plan for the teaching 
business.” 

“What plan?” she flared. 
“There never was a plan except 
to pamper your vanity! Big-shot 
Potter, the whiz-bang newspaper- 
man! That’s all you’ve ever been 
interested in!” 

I had to take a deep breath 
to keep from yelling back at her. 
“You’re not being very fair about 
this. I did it all with you and 
Tommy in mind.” 

Her voice lowered. “Is that so? 
Well, how about the promise to 
quit in six months? We’ve saved 
the money. What marvelous 



67 




thing do you have in mind for 
me and Tommy now?” 

That hurt. As a matter of fact, 
I’d been quite enjoying the stint 
with Jones. My series on juvenile 
delinquency had just about 
doubled circulation and that gave 
me a deep sense of accomplish- 
ment. Then, too, writing the stuff 
against the Mayor and the rest 
of the town’s big-wigs — in keep- 
ing with Jones’ political ambi- 
tions — nurtured a feeling of 
power that was very satisfying. 

Frankly, the meeting earlier 
that evening had set me down 
harder than I cared to admit. 
Now, with every chance for a 
comeback, Nan wanted me to 
pass! 

“Listen,” I snarled, “so it’s hot. 
So don’t take it out on me!” 

Her fists bunched and the color 
drained from her face. Knowing 
the signs, I could tell this was 
going to be a lulu. 

But the door flew open and 
Tommy came clomping through 
the hallway and into the front 
room. He’s a big kid for his age, 
mentally and physically. He 
spotted the old man right away. 

“Gol/ee/” he breathed excitedly. 
“Who’s the creep?” 

“Never mind,” Nan said, quick- 
ly recovering her composure. 
“He’s had an accident. Just get 
some money from your father 
and go to the drugstore for more 
bandages. I’ll need them.” 



I gave him a buck and he ran 
out the kitchen way, slamming 
the back door so hard, the whole 
house shook. 

The old man’s eyes flickered 
open. He looked at me first, then 
at Nan. “Well,” he said in a 
peculiar muffled tone that sug- 
gested he was speaking through 
an obstruction like a fencing 
mask, “isn’t this cozy!” 

I immediately threw a lot of 
questions at him. His name, he 
said, was Ashe — just plain Ashe. 
He couldn’t remember any other 
name. He couldn’t remember 
why he’d been beaten up, nor 
what had led up to it. He was 
very confused. He thought may- 
be it would all come back to him 
later. However, he did remember 
my rescuing him and he appre- 
ciated that very much. Hearing 
hifn say so gave me a nice, tin- 
gling glow. I invited him to stay 
for dinner and he accepted. 

jVj~AN objected. “There’s only 
" salad,” she wailed. “It was 
too hot to cook.” 

“Salad’s fine,” I told her. 

“Oh, Ted, pleasel” 

“Listen here,” I said coldly, 
“I’ve invited Ashe to stay and 
he’s accepted. Why all the fuss?” 
She gave me a hurt look, 
turned, flounced into the kitchen. 
I started to follow, thinking I’d 
made a mistake in being so 
brusque. Then I thought, the heck 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




with it. Let her take it any way 
she wanted. 

Sweat was plastering my shirt 
and pants to me like a skindiver’s 
outfit. I needed a shower. I told 
Ashe to rest easy and went into 
the bathroom. 

When I came out, Tommy had 
returned. He and the old man 
were busily gabbing. Nan, stand- 
ing by the kitchen door, frantic- 
ally signaled me to join her. In 
the kitchen, she backed me 
against the sink. “Get him out 
of here!” 

“Why?” I asked, startled. 

“There’s something wrong with 
him.” 

“Wrong?” 

“He gives me the willies.” 

“It’s just the heat,” I scoffed. 

“If you must know, he — he 
leered at me! While you were in 
the shower. It was awful!” 

“Nan, do you think that kind 
of yarn is going to stop me from 
writing about what happened to- 
night? It won’t. And you can 
make up your mind I’m keeping 
the job. When I get through with 
the people in this town, they’ll 
know they’ve been dealing with 
Edward Potter!” 

Tight-lipped, she went to the 
refrigerator for the supper. 

As soon as we’d sat down, Ashe 
began to talk. He kept it up 
through the entire meal. He’d 
been everywhere and done every- 
thing, to hear him tell it. Tommy, 



listening bug-eyed, kept asking 
questions. It sort of got me. The 
hero of the affair, to my own son, 
was Ashe! 

It was Nan who finally blew 
the whistle. 

“Mr. Ashe,” she said, her voice 
honed to a razor-edge, “I’m sure 
Ted would be much more inter- 
ested in knowing what led up to 
the fight tonight — or are you 
still confused?” 

There was a beat of three 
while he studied Nan carefully. 
Then he said, “It’s quite apparent, 
Mrs. Potter, that you’ve absolute- 
ly no use for me. This shows dis- 
cernment. Most likely, with a 
woman’s instinct, you’ve hit upon 
at least part of the truth. Because 
of that, it might be wise to lay 
all my cards on the table. But I 
warn you, it will be hard to be- 
lieve.” 

“That,” said Nan, leaning back 
with a gleam of triumph in her 
eyes, “I’ll bet on!” 

TT WAS hard to believe, all 
-®- right. So hard, in fact, that I 
thought he was just pulling Nan’s 
leg. 

He said he’d come from an- 
other world, outside our solar 
system, where people existed in 
a kind of liquid state, bouncing 
about, for the most part, like 
large water-filled bladders. They 
were, however, capable of taking 
almost any shape their superior 



THE SCAPEGOAT 



69 




minds willed. They could flatten 
and drift about in the water, or 
they could inflate and rise in the 
air. They could even become fac- 
similes of other living things, tak- 
ing on the shape, texture and 
coloration, a capability which 
aided greatly in their main func- 
tion of traveling as missionaries 
of goodness amongst the peoples 
of the Galaxy. For they were per- 
fect — as perfect as angels. 

As he talked, Nan’s face got 
redder and redder. Finally, when 
I couldn’t keep from snickering, 
she jumped up, grabbed her 
empty plate and headed for the 
kitchen. 

“Don’t rush off, honey,” I said 
innocently. 

She stopped at the kitchen 
door and glared at me. “I guess 
I know when I’m being kidded!” 
“But,” said Ashe in his cold, 
dry purr, “I’m not kidding.” 

It seemed to me the joke had 
gone far enough. “Don’t tell me,” 
I said sarcastically, “that you’re 
a missionary to Earth!” 

“No,” he admitted. “I’m here 
because I was banished.” 

“Oh. A sort of fallen angel!” 
“Exactly.” 

Another chill scurried along 
my spine. It was his tone of voice 
more than anything. But then, 
too, his eyes had a dull, black 
humorlessness about them. 

Nan returned to the table and 
sat down. I noticed a band of 



perspiration mustaching her up- 
per lip. Indeed, I seemed to have 
grown much hotter myself. 

Irritably, I said, “Ashe, it’s too 
damn warm for games. If you 
don’t want to explain what hap- 
pened this evening, that’s your 
privilege. But, as you know, the 
story means a lot to me. And I 
did stick my neck out for you!” 

He held up a .gnarled hand. 
“One moment, my boy. Let me 
finish.” 

So he finished. And the rest of 
the story was even nuttier. 

He was a throwback, he said 
with quiet pride. The perfection 
which had taken his people count- 
less years to attain was wiped 
out the moment he came into 
being. They’d tried to reform him, 
but there was something funda- 
mental about his evil — as if it 
were an essence. 

As a last resort, they’d put 
him into one of their wonderful 
machines and thrown the switch. 
At that agonizing instant, he’d 
imagined himself to be water 
scraping over the edge of a sharp 
rock. Then he’d come to, drifting 
through space. And, much later, 
he’d touched Earth. Once landed, 
he’d taken on many shapes, 
through the years — mainly, 
however, of people who’d died. 

'P'VEN AS HE talked, I was 
carefully sliding my chair 
back. If I could reach the phone

in the hallway without being no- 
ticed, it would be fairly simple 
to get help. But he saw what I 
was doing and laughed. 

“Edward,” he said, “I know 
you don’t believe me, but stick 
around until I prove it.” 

What happened next almost 
made me sick to my stomach. 
His face, which had been as 
wrinkled as a fielder’s mitt, all 
of a sudden took on the appear- 
ance of a disturbed reflection in 
a pool of water. His flesh began 
to writhe like a tangled mass of 
earthworms. Thirty seconds after 
it began, he’d sloughed off thirty 
years. Even his beard, which had 
been as white as shower-room 
tiling, became a fierce, dead black. 

I heard Tommy pipe, “Gol- 
/ee/” and Nan sigh — only it 
sounded more like a groan. I 
shook away the dazed feeling and 
it was immediately replaced by 
a great excitement. 

“Listen here,” I said hoarsely, 
“this story will set the whole 
country on its ear. With my by- 
line on it!” 

“Oh, Ted,” Nan cried, “don’t 
let him take you in! It’s a trick. 
It’s — it’s mass hypnotism or 
something.” 

“The trouble with you,” I said, 
“is you don’t believe even what 
you see with your own eyes!” 

The next day, ' I went to see 
Jones. We’d decided — Ashe and 
I — upon a course of action. The 

THE SCAPEGOAT 



existence of Ashe was to remain 
a secret, but I was to keep my job 
with the paper at all costs. Then 
we could sit back and wait for 
the opportune moment to spill it, 
a time when we had the best 
angle and were positive Ashe 
wouldn’t be labeled a hoax. 

Driving to the plant, I was 
tense enough to snap. It was not 
entirely from the unabated heat, 
either. I didn’t like the way Ashe 
had acted during the latter part 
of the evening. 

Naturally I had felt disappoint- 
ment at not being able to reveal 
his presence. But what rankled 
most was the guy’s colossal gall. 
Okay, so I’m childish, only I just 
don’t like to have someone gob- 
ble up my share of the dessert. 

He’d also borrowed all the cash 
in the house and then demanded 
I draw on my bank account. I 
quickly discouraged that. But the 
topper was his forcing Nan and 
me to sleep on the couch while 
he used the bed. He said his 
bruises still hurt, even though 
they weren’t visible. 

IX/f Y MOOD didn’t improve 
when Jones kept me waiting 
for over an hour. Surprisingly 
enough, he was in good spirits. 
As I entered the office, he indi- 
cated one of the leather chairs 
and said with a laugh, “Sit down, 
Ted. I’ve got some good news.” 

My opinion of him the previ- 

71 




ous evening obviously hadn’t 
been taken very much to heart. 
Sourly, I told him, “As a publish- 
er, you should know that good 
news is no news.” 

The smile left his face. Then, 
with a visible effort, he forced it 
back. “You have something there, 
Ted. You certainly have. But 
point of view is important, also. 
You see, they’ve arrested a gang 
of kids for shoplifting. One of 
them is Tommy, your son.” 

I jumped up. “Arrested Tom- 
my!” 

“Now wait, Ted. Don’t go off 
half-cocked. It’s a break. Don’t 
you see? You can cover delin- 
quency with the lid off now. 
You’ll be writing as a parent in 
the same boat with other 
parents. .” 

I could still hear his frantic 
noises after I’d slammed the door 
behind me and run the length of 
the corridor. 

At the police station, I had the 
distinct feeling they’d been wait- 
ing for me. I knew most of them, 
especially the big red-headed guy 
who beckoned me into a rear 
office. His name was Thompson 
— Detective Emanuel Thomp- 
son. He always looked as if he 
wore a football uniform under 
his dark blue suit. My articles 
had roasted him plenty. He 
handled juvenile delinquency 
cases. 

“Well, Mr. Potter,” he greeted 



me, Smiling tightly, “we meet un- 
der unfortunate circumstances.” 
“Can the phony sympathy,” I 
said. “You’re not the type. Just 
let me see my boy.” 

He used a red-and-blue hand- 
kerchief to wipe the dampness 
from his beefy neck. “I think we’d 
better have a little talk first.” 

“I got no talking to do. This 
is a lousy frame-up against me 
and the paper. Get my son out 
here and do it fast!” 

TIE put the handkerchief away, 
sighed and reached for the 
phone. 

It really got me when Tommy 
came into the room. He’d been 
crying; his face was streaked, and 
he looked scared and forlorn. 

“Son,” I said, finding it diffi- 
cult to keep the rasp out of my 
voice, “if you’ve got a hat, put 
it on and let’s go.” 

Thompson pulled out his hand- 
kerchief again and carefully low- 
ered himself into the chair behind 
the desk. “You don’t seem to 
understand, Mr. Potter. Your boy 
is in trouble. He’s been identified 
as leading a gang of kids who 
spent most of the morning shop- 
lifting in stores all over town.” 
“That’s bull,” I said. “How 
could my boy do a thing like 
that? He’s only twelve. Who iden- 
tified him, anyway?” 

“The shopkeepers and the 
other members of the gang.” 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




F OR ONE awful moment, I 
felt a great cavity of doubt 
“Son,” I asked, “what’s this all 
about?” 

Tommy’s face creased with 
fear and tears brimmed his eyes. 
“It was Ashe,” he quavered. 
“Ashe?” 

“Yes. I told him about the 
gang.” 

“Gang?” 

“The Red Skulls.” 

“What the heck are you talk- 
ing about?” 

“Some of the fellows got to- 
gether and built a hut for a club- 
house over on the garbage dump. 
We call ourselves the Red Skulls. 
I was made leader. I’m called 
the Skull Cap.” 

‘Why haven’t I heard about 
this?” 

“You never asked, Dad. I tried 
to tell you one night, but you 
were hurrying to get to that road- 
house on the turnpike. You said 
you had a big lead on juvenile 
delinquency.” 

“Well, you certainly didn’t try 
very hard,” I said angrily. “What 
was this gang’s purpose?” 

“Oh, different things. One of 
the fellows has a .22 and we 
hunt rats. Then — ” 

“Go on.” 

“That’s all.” 

“You started to say something 
else.” 

He kicked at the floor. “Aw, 
gee!” 



“Let’s have it!” 

“We smoked.” 

“Smoked!” 

He nodded. 

“And what else?” 

“That’s all. Honest!” 
Thompson said, “What about 
shoplifting?” 

“No,” sniveled Tommy. “That 
was Ashe. He wanted me to talk 
the gang into shoplifting, but I 
wouldn’t. Then he changed him- 
self to look like me and talked 
the fellows into it when I wasn’t 
around. I only know about it 
because I ran into them after 
they’d been in a store . .” 

Thompson gave me a funny 
look. ‘Who’s this Ashe he keeps 
talking about?” 

I started to tell him. Then I 
got a sudden mental flash of how 
idiotic it would all sound. “The 
boy,” I said evenly, “is beside 
himself because of all he’s been 
through. It’s time to call a halt 
to this farce. I’m going to hire 
myself some legal talent.” 

He shrugged. “Suit yourself.” 
Tommy grabbed my arm and 
cried, “Please don’t leave me, 
Dad!” 

I pulled away from him, feel- 
ing as if I’d dropped him off a 
cliff. 

Right outside the station, I met 
Nan. She was pale and breath- 
less. Jones had phoned the news. 
She wanted to go to Tommy 
immediately. 



THE SCAPEGOAT 



73 




I guided her to the car and 
pushed her inside. “Listen here,” 
I said tensely, “for once, don’t 
make a fuss. Just help me find 
Ashe. He’s the one who can free 
Tommy.” 

S HE BEGAN to laugh. “That’s 
a hot one!” she gasped. 
“That’s really a hot one!” 

I shook her, thinking she was 
hysterical. 

She stopped laughing and 
swallowed hard. “Ashe is home.” 
“Home?” 

“Blind drunk, with a blonde on 
his knee.” 

I tramped so hard on the ac- 
celerator that it must have 
scraped the ground all the way 
home. Ashe didn’t hear me pull 
up to the house because the radio 
was going full blast. I hit the 
light switch in the hallway and 
the brightness flared against the 
lengthening afternoon shadows, 
spotting him and the blonde on 
the living room couch. 

The blonde looked as if she’d 
come from a burlesque runway. 
Ashe dumped her- on the floor 
and staggered to his feet. He’d 
changed his appearance again. 
Now he looked a strikingly hand- 
some twenty-five. He came for- 
ward to throw a heavy arm 
around my shoulder. 

“Glad to see you, Ted,” he 
mouthed. “Ran out of money. 
Must have more. Small loan . .”

I put both hands on his chest 
and pushed. He stumbled back 
and thudded against the wall. 
“The police have picked up 
Tommy,” I said flatly. “He’s been 
charged with the shoplifting you 
did today.” 

He sobered instantly. He 
jerked the blonde to her feet, 
booted her out, slammed the door 
and came back to me. “Ted, I’m 
shocked to hear this. Tell me 
about it quickly. We must do 
something right away.” 

The blonde had begun to howl 
and scream curses. I could hear 
doors and windows opening all 
the way down the street. “You 
monster!” Nan spat, and hurried 
outside. Presently the girl quieted 
down. 

“Ted,” Ashe whispered, “I’m 
ashamed of myself. Here you be- 
friended me and all I’ve done is 
get you and your family in 
trouble.” He held a cupped hand 
over his eyes as if he were shad- 
ing tears. “Can you possibly find 
it in your heart to forgive me?” 

I was moved. After all, a poor, 
homeless alien being couldn’t 
very well be expected to under- 
stand our manners and feelings. 
Yet this one did. All because he’d 
been touched by my friendship. 

“Ashe,” I said, feeling the 
the warmth of good will, “I’m 
happy to hear you say that. By- 
gones are bygones. The important 
thing is springing Tommy.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Exactly,” he said. “We’ll go 
and explain everything to the 
police. But we’ll do it in grand 
style. This is your big show. We 
must have Jones and the Mayor. 
We must have photographers, re- 
porters, television, radio — every- 
thing!” 

WAN RETURNED. “The girl 
-L ’ will be all right. She was just 
upset.” 

“Honey,” I told her excitedly, 
“we’re about to stand the whole 
country on its collective ear. 
Ashe is going to reveal his iden- 
tity!” 

Nan’s face pinched into a look 
of disgust. “You mean you’re 
trusting this — this creature 
again?” 

“Sure, honey. Anyone can 
make a mistake.” 

“That’s right!” she exploded. 
“You’re making one now! Oh, 
Ted, stop being such a fool!” 

“Listen here,” I said, “this is 
the last two minutes of the game. 
We’re trying to score before the 
gun — and you start an argu- 
ment!” 

She began to blubber. 

Why must she always be so 
unreasonable? Why the constant 
bickering and tension and unhap- 
piness? I was sick to death of it. 
I grabbed Ashe’s arm. “Come on,” 
I said, “let’s go.” 

Even outdoors, the air felt hot 
and clammy. I headed the car 

THE SCAPEGOAT 



for the plant, figuring I could do 
my phoning from there as well 
as pick a crew. But on Main 
Street, Ashe spotted a cab and 
made me stop. 

He said he’d better go on 
ahead. He thought things would 
work smoother that way. He 
could start the ball rolling on 
the release of Tommy, and I 
wouldn’t be held up by having 
to tell people who he was. 

I drove on alone. But it was 
a mistake. People simply didn’t 
believe my story about an alien 
being. In various ways and tones 
of voice, they all suggested I go 
home and sleep it off. In despera- 
tion, I went up to Jones’ house, 
even though he’d already told 
me on the phone that he was in 
the middle of a dinner party. 

He came up close to me and 
sniffed my breath. 

“Don’t worry,” I told him. “I 
never touch it. But maybe I 
should smell yours. Anyone who 
turns his back on the biggest 
story of all time must be drunk!” 

He jerked the cigar from his 
mouth and gave me a narrow- 
eyed, searching look. “Ted, I just 
hope for your sake this isn’t 
some kind of a joke.” 

TpiFTEEN minutes later, we 
pulled up to the police sta- 
tion in a three car convoy, with 
a big crew from the paper. I led 
the group inside, feeling the ex- 

75 




citement grow in me. I marched 
up to the desk sergeant “Where 
is he?” 

The desk sergeant looked 
startled. ‘Who?” 

Well, he wasn’t there. He just 
wasn’t there! It was like getting 
tackled two yards from a touch- 
down by a tackier you hadn’t 
realized was anywhere near! 

Jones pushed forward, chew- 
ing agitatedly on his cigar. “Ed- 
ward, you’ve got some nerve, 
pulling a stunt like this! It’s an 
outrage!” 

“Take it easy,” I said weakly. 
“Something’s gone wrong.” 

“It certainly has. You must 
have gone insane!” 

“Listen here! If you don’t stick 
with me on this, I’m all through 
with the paper!” 

“That suits me fine!” 

I watched him leave, trailing 
cigar smoke. The others followed. 
My face burned and Sweat 
trickled down my back and along 
my sides. I wanted to hit out at 
something . 

A hand gripped my elbow. It 
was Sergeant Thompson. “Mr. 
Potter, you shouldn’t let this get 
you down. People’s kids get in 
scrapes all the time. Tomorrow 
you’ll have a talk with the judge 
and everything will turn out 
okay.” 

I jerked my elbow away. “In 
other words, you think I’m batty, 
too!” 



“No,” he said, gripping my el- 
bow again and starting me to- 
ward the door. “It’s been hot and 
you just need some rest” 

“Thompson,” I said, dragging 
myself to a halt, “I know it 
sounds nuts, but this Ashe char- 
acter really exists. Help me find 
him and you can cut yourself a 
slice. It’ll be big time!” 

The grip on my elbow in- 
creased. “Go home, Mr. Potter, 
and get a good night’s sleep.” 
“But it’s on the level, Thomp- 
son. Jones and I busted up. I’m 
playing on your team now!” 

His face got all flushed. “My 
job isn’t a game and I don’t be- 
long to any team. Get wise, will 
you? Stay in your own back 
yard for once. It could stand a 
lot of weeding!” He pushed me 
out the door then — so hard, I 
almost fell. 

STANDING there, feeling the 
heat press in on me, I tried 
to dope out the next move. My 
car was still at Jones’ place, so 
I’d need a cab. I turned toward 
the drugstore at the end of the 
block where I could phone. Walk- 
ing along, I recalled Ashe had 
taken a cab earlier in the evening. 
If I could talk to the driver, I 
might get a lead on his where- 
abouts. I walked faster. 

I thought of Thompson and 
his remark about the back yard 
. and the weeds. Again, for the 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




third time, a chill traveled the 
length of my spine. I began to 
run. I ran past the drugstore and 
all the way home. 

They were both in the bed- 
room. Nan stood in the far corner 
with her back against the wall. 
Her shoulders were scratched 
and her lip cut. She held a, heavy 
bookend poised to strike at Ashe, 
who was in front of her, moving 
stealthily forward. 

The moment I spun him 
around, I froze in amazement. I 
couldn’t recognize him. Then, all 
at once, I realized I was looking 
at the spitting image of myself. 

He broke from my grasp and 
darted to the window. Before I 
could follow, Nan had dropped 
the bookend and flung herself 
into my arms. “Oh, Ted,” she 
sobbed, “I knew it wasn’t you!” 

I kissed her and gently dis- 
engaged her arms. “I’ve got to get 
Ashe,” I said. 

When I vaulted through the 
window and circled the house, I 
spotted him rushing down the 



street. I caught him around the 
corner at the same spot where 
I’d first seen him. 

I slugged him. Yet I knew it 
was useless the instant the blow 
landed. He felt just like sponge 
rubber. But I kept hitting him. 
I didn’t bother listening to his 
cries and I didn’t give a damn 
that he’d changed himself back 
to an old man. 

The blow on the back of my 
neck was so sudden, I didn’t feel 
it. The only sensation was unbal- 
ance, as if I were walking up- 
hill. Then I was slapped with the 
sidewalk. 

Looking up, I could see he was 
young, clean-cut and well built. 
His long, horsy face was furious. 
“You crazy?” he yelled. “Beating 
up an old man!” 

I searched desperately for an 
explanation — something to say. 
Then, abruptly, without having 
uttered a sound, I reeled away 
and shambled hurriedly down 
the street . home, to Nan.

The Venus Trap 

By EVELYN E. SMITH 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



One thing Man never counted on to take along 
into space with him was the Eternal Triangle 
— especially a true-blue triangle like thisl 



"w: 



'HAT’S the matter, 
darling?” James 
.asked anxiously. 
“Don’t you like the planet?” 
“Oh, I love the planet,” Phyllis 
said. “It’s beautiful.” 

It was. The blue — really blue 
— grass, blue-violet shrubbery 
and, loveliest of all, the great 
golden tree with sapphire leaves 
and pale pink blossoms, instead 
of looking alien, resembled noth- 
ing so much as a fairy-tale ver- 
sion of Earth. 

Even the fragrance that filled 
the atmosphere was completely 
delightful to Terrestrial nostrils 
— which was unusual, for most 

78 



other planets, no matter how well 
adapted for colonization other- 
wise, tended, from the human 
viewpoint, anyway, to stink. Not 
that they were not colonized nev- 
ertheless, for the population of 
Earth was expanding at too great 
a rate to permit merely olfactory 
considerations to rule out an oth- 
erwise suitable planet. This 
particular group of settlers had 
been lucky, indeed, to have drawn 
a planet as pleasing to the nose 
as to the eye — and, moreover, 
free from hostile aborigines. 

As a matter of fact, the only 
apparent evidence of animate life 
were the small, bright-hued crea- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





THE VENUS TRAP 




tures winging back and forth 
through the clear air, and which 
resembled Terrestrial birds so 
closely that there had seemed no 
point to giving them any other 
name. There were insects, too, 
although not immediately percep- 
tible — -but the ones like bees were 
devoid of stings and the butter- 
flies never had to pass through 
the grub stage but were born in 
the fullness of their beauty. 

However, fairest of all the crea- 
tures on the planet to James 
Haut — just then, anyhow — was 
his wife, and the expression on 
her face was not a lovely one. 

“You do feel all right, don’t 
you?” he asked. “The light grav- 
ity gets some people at first.” 
“Yes, I guess I’m all right. I’m 
still a little shaken, though, and 
you know it’s not the gravity.” 

TTE WOULD have liked to 
take her in his arms and say 
something comforting, reassuring, 
but the constraint between them 
had not yet been worn off. Al- 
though he had sent her an ether- 
gram nearly every day of the voy- 
age, the necessarily public nature 
of the messages had kept them 
from achieving communication in 
the deeper sense of the word. 

“Well, I suppose you did have 
a bit of a shock,” he said lamely. 
“Somehow, I thought I had told 
you in my ’grams.” 

“You told me plenty in the 



’grams, but not quite enough, it 
seems.” 

Her words didn’t seem to make 
sense; the strain had evidently 
been a little too much. “Maybe 
you ought to go inside and lie 
down for a while.” 

“I will, just as soon as I feel 
less wobbly.” She brushed back 
the long, light brown hair which 
had got tumbled when she faint- 
ed. He remembered a golden 
rather than a reddish tinge in it, 
but that had been under the yel- 
low sun of Earth; under the scar- 
let sun of this planet, it took on 
a different beauty. 

“How come the preliminary 
team didn’t include — it in their 
report?” she asked, avoiding his 
appreciative eye. 

“They didn’t know. We didn’t 
find out ourselves until we’d sent 
that first message to Earth. I sup- 
pose by the time we did relay 
the news, you were on your way.” 
“Yes, that must have been it.” 
The preliminary exploration 
team had established the fact that 
the planet was more or less 
Earth-type, that its air was 
breathable, its temperature agree- 
ably springlike, its mineral com- 
position very similar to Earth’s, 
with only slight traces of unknown 
elements, that there was plenty 
of drinkable water and no threat- 
ening life-forms. Human beings 
could, therefore, live on it. 

It remained for the scout team 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




to determine whether human be- 
ings would want to live on it — 
whether, in fact, they themselves 
would want to, because, if so, 
they had the option of becoming 
the first settlers. That was the 
way the system worked and, in 
the main, it worked well enough. 

After less than two weeks, this 
scout team had beamed back to 
Earth the message that the planet 
was suitable for colonization, so 
suitable that they would like to 
give it the name of Elysium, if 
there was no objection. 

There would be none, Earth 
had replied, so long as the pio- 
neers bore 'in mind the fact that 
six other planets had previously 
been given that name, and a hu- 
man colony currently existed on 
only one of those. No need to 
worry about a conflict of nomen- 
clature, however, because the 
name of that other planet Ely- 
sium had subsequently been 
changed by unanimous vote of 
settlers to Hades. 

4 FTER this somewhat sinister 
piece of information, Earth 
had added the more cheerful 
news that the wives and families 
of the scouts would soon be on 
their way, bringing with them the 
tools and implements necessary 
to transform the wilderness of 
the frontier into another Earth. 
In the meantime, the men were to 
set up the packaged buildings 



with which all scout ships were 
equipped, so that when the wom- 
en came, homes would be ready 
for them. 

The men set to work and, be- 
fore the month was out, they dis- 
covered that Elysium was neither 
a wilderness nor a frontier. It was 
populated by an intelligent race 
which had developed its culture 
to the limit of its physical abili- 
ties — actually well beyond the 
limit of what the astounded Ter- 
restrials could have conceived its 
physical abilities to be — then, 
owing to unavoidable disaster, 
had started to die out. 

The remaining natives were 
perspicacious enough to see in 
the Terrestrials’ coming not a 
threat but a last hope of revivify- 
ing their own moribund species. 
Accordingly, the Earthmen were 
encouraged to go ahead building 
on the sites originally selected, 
the only ban being on the type of 
construction materials used — 
and a perfectly reasonable one 
under the circumstances. 

James had built his cottage 
near the largest, handsomest tree 
in the area allotted to him; since 
there were no hostile life-forms, 
there was no need for a closely 
knit community. Everyone who 
had seen it agreed that his house 
was the most attractive one of 
all, for, although it was only a 
standard prefab, he had used 
taste and ingenuity to make it a 



THE VENUS TRAP 



81 




little different from the other un- 
imaginative homes. 

And now Phyllis, for whom he 
had performed all this labor of 
love, for whom he had waited five 
long months — the tedium of 
which had been broken only by 
the intellectual pleasure of teach- 
ing English to a sympathetic na- 
tive neighbor — Phyllis seemed 
unappreciative. She had hardly 
looked at the inside of the cot- 
tage, when he had shown her 
through, and now was staring at 
the outside in a blank sort of 
way. 

The indoctrination courses had 
not, he reflected, reconciled her 
to the frontiersman's necessarily 
simple mode of living — which was 
ironic, considering that one of her 
original attractions for him had 
been her apparent suitability for 
the pioneer life. She was a big 
girl, radiantly healthy, even 
though a little green at the mo- 
ment. 

TTE JUST managed to keep his 
voice steady. “You don’t like 
the house — is that it? 

“But I do like it. Honestly I 
do.” She touched his arm diffi- 
dently. “Everything would be per- 
fect if only — ” 

“If only what? Is it the cur- 
tains? I’m sorry if you don’t like 
them. I brought them all the way 
from Earth in case the planet 
turned out to be habitable. I 

82 



thought blue was your favorite 
color.” 

“Oh, it is, it is! I’m mad about 
the curtains.” 

Perhaps it wasn’t the house 
that disappointed her; perhaps it 
was he himself who hadn’t lived 
up to dim memory and ardent ex- 
pectation. 

“If you want to know what is 
bothering me — ’’she glanced up 
apprehensively, lowering her 
voice as she did — “it’s that tree. 
It’s stuck on you; I just know 
it is.” 

He laughed. “Now where did 
you get a preposterous idea like 
that, Phyl? You’ve been on the 
planet exactly twenty-four hours 
and — ” 

“ — and I have, in my luggage, 
one hundred and thirty-two eth- 
ergrams talking about practically 
nothing but Magnolia this, Mag- 
nolia that. Oh, I had my suspi- 
cions even before I landed, James. 
The only thing I didn’t suspect 
was that she was a free!” 

“What are <you talking about, 
honey? Magnolia and I — we’re 
just friends.” 

“Purely a platonic relationship, 
I assure you,” the tree herself 
agreed. It would have been silly 
for her to pretend not to have 
overheard, since the two were 
still standing almost directly un- 
derneath her. “Purely platonic." 

“She’s more like a sister to me,” 
James tried to explain. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




"DHYLLIS stiffened. “Frankly, 
if I had imagined I was going 
to have a tree for a sister-in-law, 
I would have thought before I 
married you, James.” Bursting 
into tears, she ran inside the cot- 
tage. 

“Sorry,” he said miserably to 
Magnolia. “It’s a long trip out 
from Earth and an uncomfortable 
one. I don’t suppose the other 
women were especially nice to 
her, either. Faculty wives mostly 
and you know how they are . 
No, I don’t suppose you would. 
But she shouldn’t have acted that 
way toward you.” 

“Not your fault,” Magnolia 
told him, sighing with such inten- 
sity that he could feel the humid- 
ity rise. “I know how you’ve been 
looking forward to her arrival. 
Rather a letdown, isn’t it?” 

“Oh, I’m sure it’ll be all right.” 
He tried to sound confident. “And 
I know you’ll like Phyllis when 
you get to know her.” 

“Possibly, but so far I’m afraid 
I must admit — since there never 
has been any pretense between 
us — that she is a bit of a disap- 
pointment. I — and my sisters also 
— had expected your females, 
when they came, to be as upright 
and true blue as you. Instead, 
what are they? Shrubs.” 

The door to the cottage flew 
open. “A shrub, am I!” Phyllis 
brandished an axe which, James 
winced to recall, was an item of 



the equipment he had ordered 
from Earth before the scout team 
had learned that the trees were 
intelligent. “I’ll shrub you!” 
“Phyllis!” He wrested the axe 
from her grip. “That would be 
murder!” 

“ ‘Woodman,’ as the Terrestrial 
poem goes,” the tree remarked, 
“‘spare that tree! Touch not a 
single bough! In youth it shel- 
tered me and I’ll protect it now!’ ” 
Good of her to take the whole 
thing so calmly — rather, to pre- 
tend to take it so calmly, for he 
knew how sensitive Magnolia 
really was — but he was afraid 
this show of moral courage would 
not diminish Phyllis’s dislike for 
her; those without self-control sel- 
dom appreciate those who have 
it. 

“If you’ll excuse us,” he said, 
putting his arm around his wife’s 
heaving shoulders, “I’d better see 
to Phyllis; she’s a little upset. 
Holdover from spacesickness, I 
expect. Poor girl, she’s a long way 
from home and frightened.” 

“I understand, Jim,” Magnolia 
told him, “and, remember, what- 
ever happens, you can always 
count on me.” 

6CT MUST say you’re not a very 
admirable representative of 
Terrestrial womanhood!” James 
snapped, as soon as the door had 
slammed behind him and his wife, 
leaving them alone together in 



tHE VENUS TRAP 



83 




the principal room of the cottage. 
“Insulting the very first native 
you meet!” 

“I did not either insult her. All 
I said was, What beautiful flow- 
ers — do you suppose the fruit is 
edible?’ How was I to know it 
— she could understand? Natu- 
rally I wouldn’t dream of eating 
her fruit now. It would probably 
taste nasty anyway. And how do 
you think l felt when a tree an- 
swered me back? You don’t care 
that I fainted dead away, and 
I’ve never fainted before in my 
life. All you care about is that 
old vegetable’s feelings! It was 
bad enough, feeling for five 
months that someone had come 
between us, but to find out it 
wasn’t someone but something — !” 

“Phyllis,” he said coldly, “I’ll 
thank you to keep a civil tongue 
in your head.” 

Dropping into the overstuffed 
chair, his wife dabbed at her eyes 
with a handkerchief. “She wasn’t 
so very polite to me!” 

“Look, Phyllis — ”he strove to 
make his voice calm, adult, rea- 
sonable — “you happened to have 
hit on rather a touchy point with 
her. Those trees are dioecious, 
you know, like us, and she isn’t 
mated. And, well, she has rather 
a lot of xylem zones — rings, you 
know.” 

“Are you trying to tell me she’s 
old?” 

“Well, she’s no sapling any 



more. And, consideration aside, 
you know it’s government’s policy 
for us to establish good relations 
with any intelligent life-form we 
have to share a planet with. You 
weren’t in there trying.” 

Phyllis put away her handker- 
chief with what he hoped would 
be a final sniff. “I suppose I 
shouldn’t have acted that way,” 
she conceded. 

“Now you’re talking like my 
own dear Phyllis,” James said 
tenderly, though, as a matter of 
fact, he had a very remote idea 
of what his own dear Phyllis was 
like. He had met her only a cou- 
ple of months before the scout 
mission was scheduled, and so 
their courtship had been brief, 
and the actual weeks of marriage 
even briefer. He had remembered 
Phyllis as beautiful — and she was 
beautiful. He had not, however, 
remembered her as pig-headed — 
and pig-headed she was, too. 

“How come she hasn’t a mate? 

I didn’t think trees were choosy.” 

TTE WOULDN’T take excep- 
tion to that statement, un- 
charitable though it was; after 
all, someone whose only acquaint- 
ance with trees had been with 
the Terrestrial variety would na- 
turally be incapable of appreciat- 
ing the total tree at its highest 
development. 

“It’s a great tragedy,” he told 
her in a hushed tone. “There was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



84 




a blight some years back and 
most of the male trees died off, 
except for a few on the other side 
of the planet — well out of bee- 
shot, even if the females there 
would let the females here have 
any pollen, which they absolutely 
won’t.” 

“I don’t blame them,” Phyllis 
said coldly. Of course she would 
identify at once with the trees 
whose domestic lives seemed to 
be threatened. 

“It’s not that so much. It’s that 
the male trees produce so little 
pollen.” 

‘This would be a good place 
for people with hay fever then, 
wouldn’t it?” 

“And even when there is fruit, 
so much of it tends to be par- 
thenocarpous — no seeds.” He 
sighed. ‘The entire race is dying 
out.” 

“How is it you know so much 
about botany?” she asked suspi- 
ciously. “It’s not your field.” 

“I don’t know so very much, 
really,” he smiled. “I had to learn 
a little, if I wanted to work the 
land, so I borrowed an elemen- 
tary text from Cutler.” Had he 
been a trifle idealistic in quitting 
his snug, if uninspiring, job on 
the faculty to join in this Utopian 
venture? So many of the other 
men at the university had en- 
rolled, it had seemed a splendid 
idea until Phyllis’s arrival. 

“Daddy never had any trouble 



working his land and he doesn’t 
know a thing about botany. 
You’ve been boning up on it just 
to please her!” 

“Phyllis! How can you jump 
to conclusions without a shred of 
evidence?” Not that she wouldn’t 
be able to collect such evidence 
later, because the allegation hap- 
pened to be correct. If, instead of 
coming to Elysium, I had merely 
gone to China, would she have 
thought it so odd that l studied 
Chinese? Then why, where the 
natives are trees, shouldn’t I 
study botany? The woman is un- 
reasonable. 

W A ND will her — people let 
you farm?” 

Now he could show her how 
cogently and comprehensively he 
could answer a logical question. 
“That aspect of the situation will . 
be all right, dear, because only 
the trees are an intelligent spe- 
cies and, even of them, some 
aren’t so bright. They won’t have 
any more objection to our eating 
the other fruit and vegetables 
than we would have to an extra- 
terrestrial’s eating our eggs and 
chickens, for example. We’re go- 
ing to try to introduce some 
Earth plants here, though, as the 
higher forms of vegetation are 
dying out and we’re afraid the 
lower might follow. Pity it’s too 
late for a sound conservation pro- 
gram.”

P HYLLIS said grimly, “She 
doesn’t think it’s too late for 
a sound conservation program. 
She still has hopes — far-fetched, 
maybe, and I’m not so sure they 
are. Mark my words, James, she’s 
got designs on you.” 

“Don’t be idiotic,” he protested. 
“That would be — ” he attempted 
to introduce a light note — “it 
would be miscegenation.” 

“These foreigners can’t be ex- 
pected to have our standards.” 
And she burst into tears again. 
“A fine thing to go through that 
miserable five-month trip only to 
find out a tree has alienated my 
husband’s affections.” 

“Oh, come on, Phyl!” He still 
was trying for a smile. “What 
would a tree see in me?” 

“I’m beginning to wonder what 
I saw in you. You never loved 
me; you just wanted a wife to 
come out and colonize with you 
and b-b-breed.” 

What could he say? It was al- 
most true. Phyllis was a beautiful 
girl and he loved her, but, if he 
had planned to remain as an in- 
structor with the Romance Lan- 
guages Department instead of 
joining the scout mission, he knew 
he would never have asked her 
to be his wife . for her sake, of 
course, as well as his own. He 
should say something to reassure 
her, but the words wouldn’t come. 

“I don’t like it here,” Phyllis 
sobbed. “I don’t like blue leaves. 

86 



I don’t like blue grass, I like them 
green, the way they’re supposed 
to be. I hate this nasty planet. It’s 
all wrong. I want to go home.” 
She was very young — less than 
eight years younger than he, true, 
but he was mature for his age. 
They didn’t know each other very 
well. And, finally, there were 
more men than women on the 
planet and he had noticed that 
the bachelors had seemed readily 
disposed, upon her arrival the 
day before, to overlook the fact 
that she had no college degree. 
So he must be patient with her. 

“There’s nothing wrong about 
it, dear. The plants here synthe- 
size cyanophyll instead of chloro- 
phyll; that’s why the leaves are 
blue instead of green. And, of 
course, there are different min- 
eral constituents of the soil — 
more aluminum and copper, for 
instance, than on Earth, and some 
elements we haven’t quite iso- 
lated yet. So, you see, they’re 
bound to be a little different from 
Terrestrial trees.” 

“A little different I wouldn’t 
mind,” she said sulkily, “but 
they’re a lot different without be- 
ing nearly alien enough.” 

“Look, Phyllis — dear — those 
trees have been very hospitable, 
very kind. We owe them a lot. 
They themselves suggested that 
we come here and live with them 
in, so to speak, symbiosis.” 

“That’s a fine idea!”

1TE BEAMED. “I knew you’d 
understand after I had ex- 
plained it to you.” 

“We provide the brains and 
they provide the furniture.” 
“Phyllis! What a thing to say!” 
“I’ve heard of man-eating trees 
before. I suppose there could be 
man-loving ones, too.” 

“Phyllis, these trees are as gen- 
tle and sweet as — as — ” He didn’t 
know how he could explain it to 
her. No one who had never been 
friends with a tree could appre- 
ciate the true beauty of the xy- 
lemic character. “Why, we even 
offered to go over to the other 
side of the planet and fetch some 
pollen for them, but they wouldn’t 
hear of it. Unfortunately, they’d 
rather die than be mated to any- 
one they had never met.” 

“What a perfectly disgusting 
idea!” 

“I don’t think so. Trees can be 
idealistic — ■” 

“You fetching pollen for her, I 
mean. Naturally she wouldn’t 
want pollen from a tree on the 
other side of the planet. She 
wants you!” 

“Don’t be silly. Incompatibility 
usually exists between the pollen 
of one species and the stigmata 
of another. Besides,” he added 
patiently, “I haven’t got pollen.” 
“You’d better not, or it won’t 
be her who’ll have the stigmata.” 
“Phyllis — ” he sat down on the 
arm of her chair and tried to em- 



brace her — “you know that you’re 
the only life-form I love.” 

“Please, James.” She pushed 
him away. “I guess I love you, 
too, in spite of everything . 
but I don’t want to make a public 
spectacle of myself.” 

“What do you mean now?” 

“That tree would know every- 
thing that goes on. She’s tele- 
pathic.” 

"Where did you get a ridicu- 
lous idea like that? What kind 
of rubbish have you been read- 
ing?” 

“All right, tell me : how else did 
she learn to speak such good Eng- 
lish?” 

“It’s because she’s of a very 
high order of intelligence. And I 
suppose — ” he laughed modestly 
— “because I’m such a good 
teacher.” 

“I don’t care how good a 
teacher you are — a tree couldn’t 
learn to speak a language so well 
in five months. She must be tele- 
pathic. It’s the only explanation.” 

64/^IVE her time,” the tree ad- 
vised later, as James came 
out on the lawn to talk to his 
only friend on the planet. 

He hadn’t seen much of the 
other scouts since the house- 
building frenzy had started, and 
visits among the men had de- 
creased. The base camp, where 
the bachelors and the older mar- 
ried couples lived, was located a 



THE VENUS TRAP

good distance away from his 
land, for he had raised his honey- 
moon cottage far from the rest; 
he had wanted to have his Phyl- 
lis all to himself. In the idyll he 
had visualized for the two of 
them, she would need no com- 
pany but his. Little had he imag- 
ined that, within twenty-four 
hours of her arrival, he would be 
looking for company himself. 

“I suppose so,” he said, kicking 
at a root. “Oh, I’m sorry, Maggie; 
I didn’t think.” 

“That’s all right,” Magnolia 
said bravely. “It didn’t really hurt. 
That female has got you all up- 
set, you poor boy.” 

James muttered a feeble de- 
fense of his wife. 

“Jim, forgive me if I speak 
frankly,” the tree went on in a 
low rustle, “but do you think 
she’s really worthy of you?” 

“Of course she is!” 

“Surely on your planet you 
could have found a mate more 
admirable, high-minded, exem- 
plary — more, in short, like your- 
self. Or are all the human females 
inferior specimens like Phyllis?” 
“They’re — she suits me,” James 
said doggedly. 

“Of course, of course. It’s very 
noble of you to defend her; you 
would have disappointed me if 
you had said anything else, and I 
honor you for it, James.” 

He kicked at one of the peb- 
bles. The tree meant well, he 



knew, yet, like so many well- 
meaning friends, she succeeded 
only in dispiriting him. It was al- 
most like being back at the fac- 
ulty club. 

“I don’t suppose a clod like her 
would have brought any more 
books along,” the tree changed 
the subject. James’s own library 
had been insufficient to slake the 
tree’s intellectual thirst, so he had 
gone all over the planet to bor- 
row books for Magnolia. Dr. La- 
kin, at Base, who had formerly 
taught English literature, pos- 
sessed a fine collection which he 
had been reluctant to lend until 
he had learned that they were 
not for James but for a tree. At 
that, he had fetched the books 
himself, since he was anxious to 
meet her. 

“A lot of the trees here have 
learned the English language,” he 
had told James, “but none seems 
to have developed a taste for its 
literature. Your Magnolia is un- 
doubtedly a superior specimen. 
Excellent natural taste, too — 
perhaps a little unformed when 
it comes to poetry and the more 
sophisticated aspects of life, but 
she’ll learn, she’ll learn.” 

| TNFORTUNATELY, the same, 
^ James knew, could hardly 
be said of his wife. “Phyllis did 
bring some books,” he told Mag- 
nolia. 

“For you, no doubt. That was 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




kind of her. I’m stire she has 
many good qualities which will 
unfold one by one, as her meri- 
stems start differentiating. I hope 
you don’t feel I’ve been too • — 
well, personal, Jim. I was only 
trying to help. If I’ve gone too 
far . .” 

“Of course not, Maggie. After 
all — ” he laughed bitterly — “I do 
know you better than I know 
her.” 

“We have been good friends, 
haven’t we, Jim? It was rather 
nice — these five months we spent 
alone together. For the first time 
in my life, I have never regretted 
being so far from my sisters. ‘And 
this our life, exempt from public 
haunt, finds tongues in trees, 
books in the running brooks, ser- 
mons in stones, and good in ev- 
erything.’ ” 

Her blue leaves shone violet in 
the scarlet rays of the setting sun; 
the gold of her trunk was lit with 
red radiance. She was the most 
beautiful creature he had ever 
seen . but she was a tree, not 
a woman. 

“I’m sure she’ll fit in after a 
while,” Magnolia continued. 
“Perhaps she isn’t well. She seems 
to guttate an awful lot. Do you 
suppose she’s been overwa- 
tered?” 

“That wasn’t guttation,” James 
said heavily. “It was tears. It 
means she’s unhappy,” 

“Unhappy? Perhaps she won’t 

THE VENUS TRAP 



fit in on this planet, in which case 
she should by all means go back 
to Earth. It’s cruel and unfair to 
keep an intelligent — loosely 
speaking — life-form anywhere 
against her will, don’t you think?” 
“She’ll be happy here,” James 
vowed. “I’ll make her happy.” 
“Well, I certainly hope you can 
manage it! By the way, do you 
suppose you’ll have a chance to 
read me the books she brought, or 
will she be keeping you too 
busy?” 

“I’ll never be too busy to read 
to you, Magnolia.” 

“That’s very nitrogenous of 
you, Jim. Our — intellectual com- 
munions have meant a lot to me. 
I’d hate to have to give them up.” 
“So would I,” he said. “But 
there won’t be any need to. Phyl- 
lis will understand.” 

“I certainly hope so. I so ad- 
mire your English literature. It’s 
so deeply cognizant of the really 
meaningful things in life. And if 
your coming to this planet has 
served only to add poetry to our 
cultural heritage, it would be rea- 
son enough to welcome you with 
open limbs. For it was a truly 
perceptive versifier who wrote 
the immortally simple lines: 
‘Poems are made by fools like 
me, but only God can make a 
tree.’ 

“And such a charming tune to 
go with it, too,” Magnolia went 
on. “We have always sung the 



89 




music that the wind and the rain 
have taught us, but, until you 
came, we never thought of put- 
ting words and melody together 
to form one glorious whole. ‘A 
tree that may in summer wear,’ ” 
she caroled in a pleasing con- 
tralto, “‘a nest of robins in her 
hair.’ By the way, Jim, ever since 
reading that poem, I’ve been 
meaning to ask you precisely 
what are robins and do you think 
they’d look well in my hair, by 
which, I suppose the bard refers, 
in a somewhat pedestrian flight 
of fancy, to leaves?” 

“They’re a kind of bird,’ he 
said drearily. 

“Birds — nesting in my hair! 
I wouldn’t think of allowing it. 
But then I suppose Terrestrial 
birds are quite different from 
ours? More housebroken, shall we 
say?” 

“Everything’s different,” James 
said and, for an irrational mo- 
ment, he hated everything that 
was blue that should have been 
green, everything sweet that 
should have been vicious, every- 
thing intelligent that should have 
been mindless. 

CINCE matters could not grow 
^ much worse, they improved 
to a degree. After a day or two 
had passed, Phyllis, being a con- 
scientious girl, came to realize 
how wrong it had been for her as 
a Terrestrial immigrant to show 

90 



overt hostility toward a native of 
the planet that had welcomed 
her. 

“But how can she be a — a per- 
son?” Phyllis wanted to know, 
when they were inside the cot- 
tage, for she had learned to hold 
her tongue when they were near 
Magnolia or any of her sisters, 
who, though they could not speak 
the language as fluently as she, 
understood it very well and eaves- 
dropped at every possible oppor- 
tunity in order, they said, to im- 
prove their accents. “She’s a tree. 
A plant. And plants are just vege- 
tables.” She stabbed her needle 
energetically through the table- 
cloth she was embroidering. 

“You mustn’t project Terres- 
trial attitudes upon Elysian 
ones,” James said, patiently look- 
ing up from his book. “And don’t 
underestimate Magnolia’s capa- 
bilities. She has sense organs, and 
motor organs, too. She can’t move 
from where she is, because she’s 
rooted to the ground, but she’s 
capable of turgor movements, 
like certain Terrestrial forms of 
vegetation — for example, the 
sensitive plant or blue grass.” 

“Blue grass,” Phyllis exclaimed. 
“I’m sick of blue grass. I want 
green grass.” 

“However, these trees have 
conscious control of their pufv- 
ini, whereas the Earth’s plants 
don’t, and so they can do a lot of 
things that Earth plants can’t.” 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“It sounds like a dirty word to 
me.” 

“Pulvini merely means motor 
organs.” 

“Oh.” 

TIE CLOSED his book, which 
was a more advanced botany 
text, covered with the jacket of 
a French novel in order to spare 
Phyllis’s feelings. “Darling, can’t 
you get it through your pretty 
head that they’re intelligent life- 
forms? If it’ll make it easier for 
you to think of them as human 
beings who happen to look like 
trees, then do that.” 

“That’s exactly what I am do- 
ing. And I’m quite sure she thinks 
of you as a tree who happens to 
look like a human being.” 

“Phyllis, sometimes I think 
you’re being deliberately difficult. 
Do you know one of the reasons 
why I took such pains to teach 
Magnolia English? It was that I 
hoped she would be a companion 
for you, that you could talk to 
■ each other when I had to be 
away from home.” 

“Why do you call her Magno- 
lia? She isn’t a lot like one.” 
“Isn’t she? I thought she was. 
You see, I don’t know so much 
botany, after all.” Actually, he 
had picked that name for the tree 
because it expressed both the ar- 
boreal and the feminine at the 
same time — and also because it 
was one of the loveliest names he 



knew. But he couldn’t tell Phyllis 
that; there would be further mis- 
understanding. “Of course she has 
a name in her own language, but 
I can’t pronounce it.” 

“They do have a language of 
their own then?” 

“Naturally, though they don’t 
get much chance to speak it, since 
they’ve grown so few and far 
apart that verbal communication 
has become difficult. They com- 
municate by a network of roots 
that they’ve developed.” 

“I don’t think that’s so clever.” 
“I merely said... oh, what’s the 
use of trying to explain every- 
thing to you? You just don’t 
want to understand.” 

TJ HYLLIS put down her nee- 
dlework and closed her eyes. 
“James,” she said, opening them 
again, “it’s no use pretending. 
I’ve been trying to be sympa- 
thetic and understanding, but I 
can’t do it. That tree — I’ve forced 
myself to be nice to her, but the 
more I see of her, the more con- 
vinced I am that she’s trying to 
steal you from me.” 

Phyllis was beginning to poi- 
son his mind, he thought, because 
it had seemed to him also, in his 
last conversation with Magnolia, 
that he had discerned more than 
ordinary warmth in her attitude 
toward him . and perhaps a 
trace of spite toward his wife? 
Preposterous! The tree had 



THE VENUS TRAP 



91 




only been trying to cheer him up 
as any friend might reasonably 
do. After all, a tree and a man 
. Nonsense! One had an ana- 
bolic metabolism, one a catabolic. 

But this was a different kind 
of tree. She spoke, she read, she 
was capable of conscious turgor 
movements. And he, he had often 
thought secretly, was a different 
kind of man. Whereas Phyllis... 

But that was disloyalty — to 
the type as well as the individual. 
The tree could be a companion 
to him, but she could not give 
him sons to work his land; she 
could not give him daughters to 
populate his planet; moreover, 
she did not, could not possibly 
know what human love meant, 
while Phyllis could at least learn. 

“Look, dear,” he said, sitting 
down beside his wife on the couch 
and taking her hand in his. She 
didn’t draw away this time. “Sup- 
pose that what you say is true — 
not that it is, of course. Just be- 
cause the tree has a crush on me 
doesn’t mean I necessarily have 
a crush on her, does it?” 

His wife looked up at him, her 
rose-red lips parted, her moss- 
gray eyes shining. “Oh, if only I 
could believe that, James!” 
“Anyhow, she doesn’t know 
what the whole thing’s about, 
poor kid!” 

“Poor kid\” 

“Phyllis, you know you’re pret- 
tier than any tree.” That was not 

92 



literally true, but reason was use- 
less; he had to make his point in 
terms she could understand. “And, 
remember, she’s got a lot of rings 
— she must be centuries old — 
while you are only nineteen.” 
“Twenty,” Phyllis corrected. “I 
had a birthday on the ship.” 
“Well, you certainly must al- 
low me to wish you a happy 
birthday, darling.” 

She was in his arms at last; 
he was about to kiss her, and the 
tree seemed very remote, when 
she drew back. “But are you sure 
she doesn’t — she isn’t — she can’t 
be watching us?” 

“Darling, I swear it!” “Lady, by 
yonder blessed moon I swear, that 
tips with silver all these fruit-tree 
tops ” . But he had sense 
enough not to say it, and Elysium 
had not one blessed moon, but 
three, and everything was all 
right. 

For a while anyway. 

66T SEE your wife is developing 
a corm,” the tree remarked, 
as James paused for a chat. He 
hadn’t much time to be sociable 
those days, for there was such a 
lot of work to be done, so many 
preparations to be made, so many 
things to be requisitioned from 
Earth. The supply ships were be- 
ginning to come now, bringing 
necessities and an occasional lux- 
ury for those who could afford it. 
“She’s pregnant,” James ex- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




plained. “Happened before I left 
Earth.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“She’s about to fruit. Didn’t I 
read that zoology book to you?” 

“Yes, but — oh, James, it all 
seems so vulgar! To fruit without 
ever having bloomed — how 
squalid!” 

“It all depends on how you 
look at it,” he said. “I — that is, 
we had hoped that when the baby 
came, you would be godmother 
to it. You know what that is, 
don’t you?” 

“Of course I do. You read Cin- 
derella to me. I know it’s a great 
honor. But I’m afraid I must de- 
cline.” 

“Why? I thought you were my 
— our friend.” 

“Jim, there is something I must 
confess: my feelings toward you 
are not merely those of a friend. 
Although Phyllis doesn’t have too 
many rings of intellect, she is a 
female, so she knew all along.” 
Magnolia’s leaves rustled diffi- 
dently. “I feel toward you the 
way I never felt toward any intel- 
ligent life-form, but only toward 
the sun, the soil, the rain. I sense 
a tropism that seems to incline 
me toward you. In fact, I’m 
afraid, Jim, in your own terms, I 
love you.” 

“But you’re a tree! You can’t 
love me in my own terms, because 
trees can’t love in the way peo- 
ple can, and, of course, people 



can’t love like trees. We belong 
to two entirely different species, 
Maggie. You can’t have listened 
to that zoology book very atten- 
tively.” 

“Our race is a singularly adapt- 
able one or we wouldn’t have sur- 
vived so long, Jim, or gone so far 
in our particular direction. It’s 
lack of fertility, not lack of en- 
terprise, that’s responsible for our 
decline. And I think your species 
must be an adaptable one, too; 
you just haven’t really tried. Oh, 
James, let us reverse the classical 
roles — let me be the Apollo to 
your Daphne! Don’t let Phyllis 
stand in our way. The Greek gods 
never let a little thing like mar- 
riage interfere with their plans.” 

6613UT I love Phyllis,” he said 
in confusion. “I love you, 
too,” he added, “but in a different 
way.” 

“Yes, I know. More like a sis- 
ter. However, I have plenty of 
sisters and I don’t need a brother.” 

“We’re starting a conservation 
program,” he tried to comfort her. 
“We have every hope of getting 
some pollen from the other side 
of the planet once we have ex- 
plained to the trees there how 
far we can make a little go, and 
you’ve got to accept it; you 
mustn’t be silly about it.” 

“It isn’t the same thing, Jim, 
and you know it. One of the pen- 
alties of intelligence is a diffu-

siveness of the natural instincts. 
I would rather not fruit at all 
than — ” 

“Magnolia, you just don’t un- 
derstand. No matter how much 
you — well, pursue me, I can nev- 
er turn into a laurel tree.” 

“I didn’t—” 

“Or any kind of tree! Look, 
some more books were just sent 
over from Base.” 

Magnolia gave a rueful rustle. 
“Just were sent? Didn’t they 
come over a month ago?” 

James flushed. “I know I 
haven’t had a chance to do much 
reading to you in the last few 
weeks, Maggie — or any at all, in 
fact — but I’ve been so busy. 
After the baby’s born, things will 
be much less hectic and we’ll be 
able to catch up.” 

“Of course, James. I under- 
stand. Naturally your family 
comes first.” 

“One of the books that came 
was an advanced zoology text 
that might make things a little 
clearer.” 

“I should very much like to 
hear it. When you have the time 
to spare, that is.” 

“Tell you what,” he said. “I’ll 
get the book and read you the 
chapter on the reproductive sys- 
tem in mammals. Won’t take 
more than an hour or so.” 

“If you’re in a hurry, it can 
wait.” 

“No,”" he told her. “This will 




94 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



make me feel a little less guilty 
about having neglected you.” 

U W HEREU P° N the umbilical 
** cord is severed,” he con- 
cluded, “and the human infant is 
ready to take its place in the 
world as a separate entity. Now 
do you understand, Magnolia?” 
“No,” she said. “Where do the 
bees come in?” 

“I thought you were in such a 
hurry to get to Base, James,” 
Phyllis remarked sweetly from 
the doorway, wiping her redden- 
ing hands on a dish towel. 

“I am, dear.” He slipped the 
book behind his back; it was pos- 
sible that, in her present state of 
mind — induced, of course, by her 
delicate condition — Phyllis 
might misunderstand his motive 
in reading that particular chap- 
ter of that particular book to that 
particular tree. “I just stopped 
for a chat with Magnolia. She’s 
agreed to be godmother to the 
baby.” 

“How very nice of her. Elarth 
Government will be so pleased at 
such a fine example of rapport 
with the natives. You might even 
get a medal. Wouldn’t that be 
nice? . James,” she hurried on, 
before he could speak, “you still 
haven’t found any green-leafed 
plants on the planet, have you? 
Have you looked everywhere? 
Have you looked hard?” 

“Haven’t I told you time and 




time again, Mrs. Haut,” the tree 
said, “that there aren’t any — 
that there can’t be any? It’s im- 
possible to synthesize chlorophyll 
from the light rays given off by 
our sun — only cyanophyll. What 
do you want with a green-leafed 
plant, anyway?” 

Phyllis’s voice broke. “I think 
I’d lose my mind if I was con- 
vinced that I’d never see a green 
leaf again. All this awful blue, 
blue, blue, all the time, and the 
leaves never fall, or, if they do, 
there are new ones right away to 
take their place. They’re always 
there — always blue.” 

“We’re everblue,” Magnolia ex- 
plained. “Sorry, but that’s the 
way it is.” 

“Jim, I hate to hurt your feel- 
ings, but I just have to take down 
those curtains. The colors — I 
can’t stand it!’ 

44 TJ REGNANT women some- 
times get fanciful notions,” 
James said to the tree. “It’s part 
of the pregnancy syndrome. Try 
not to pay any attention.” 

“Kindly don’t explain me to a 
tree!” Phyllis cried. “I have a 
right to prefer green, don’t I?” 
“There is, as your proverb says, 
no accounting for strange tastes,” 
the tree murmured. “However — •” 
“We’re going to have a formal 
christening,” James interrupted, 
for the sake of the peace. “We 
thought we should, since ours 

96 



will be the first baby born on the 
planet. Everybody on Elysium 
will come — that is, all the human 
beings. Only because they can 
come, you know; we’d love to 
have the trees if they were capa- 
ble of locomotor movement. 
You’ll get to widen your social 
contacts, Maggie. Dr. Lakin and 
Dr. Cutler will probably be here; 
I know you’ll be glad to see Dr. 
Lakin again, and you’ve been 
anxious to meet Dr. Cutler. 
They’ve been asking after you, 
too. I think Dr. Lakin is plan- 
ning to write a monograph on you 
for the Journal of the American 
Association of Professors of Eng- 
lish Literature — with your per- 
mission, of course.” 

“Christening — that’s one of 
your native festivals, isn’t it? It 
should be most interesting.” 
“That’s right,” Phyllis mur- 
mured. “It will be Christmas 
soon. I’d almost forgotten. It’ll 
be the first Christmas I’ve ever 
spent away from home. And 
there won’t be any snow or — or 
anything.” She started to guttate 
— to cry again. 

“Cheer up, honey,” Jim said. 
“It won’t be as bad as you think, 
because I didn’t forget Christmas 
was coming. There’s something 
specially nice for you on its way 
from Earth; I only hope it gets 
here on time.” Phyllis sniffled. 
“Maybe we’ll have a Christmas 
party, too. Would you like that?”

But she remained unresponsive. 

He turned to the tree. “Chris- 
tening’s entirely different, 
though,” he explained. “It’s — I 
guess naming the fruit would be 
the best way to describe it.” 

“Is that so?” Magnolia said. 
“What kind of fruit do you ex- 
pect to have, Mrs. Haut? Or- 
anges? Bananas? As your good 
St. Luke says, the tree is known 
by its fruit. You look as if yours 
might be a watermelon.” 

“Why, the — idea!” Phyllis 
choked. “Are you going to stand 
there, James, and let that vege- 
table insult me?” 

“I’m sure she didn’t mean to,” 
he protested. “She got confused 
by — that zoology book I read 
her.” 

The door slammed behind his 
weeping wife. 

“I don’t think you quite under- 
stand, Maggie,” he said. “In fact, 
sometimes I almost think you, 
too, don’t want to understand.” 
“I know what kind of fruit it’s 
going to be,” the tree concluded 
triumphantly. “Sour apples.” 

44/"KUCH,” exclaimed Magnolia, 
“that tickles! There’s more 
to acting as a Christmas tree than 
I had anticipated from your glow- 
ing descriptions, Jim.” 

“Here, dear,” Phyllis said, 
“maybe you’d better let me put 
the decorations on her.” 

“You can’t get on the ladder 



in your condition,” he said, ap- 
prehensive not only for her wel- 
fare but for the tree’s. Phyllis had 
not taken kindly to the idea of 
having Magnolia as official Christ- 
mas tree, suggesting that, if she 
must participate in the ceremo- 
nies, it might be better in the 
capacity of Yule log. However, 
Jim knew Magnolia would be of- 
fended if any other tree were 
chosen to be decorated. 

“I’ll manage all right,” he as- 
sured his wife. “If you want to 
be useful, you might put on some 
coffee and make sandwiches or 
something. The bachelors are 
coming over from Base with that 
equipment that arrived yester- 
day, and they’ll probably be glad 
of a snack before turning in.” 
“The coffee’s already on and 
the canapes made,” Phyllis 
smiled. “And I’ve baked cookies, 
too, and whipped up a batch of 
penuche. What kind of a Christ- 
mas party do you think it would 
be without refreshments?” 

“Very efficient, isn’t she?” 
Magnolia remarked, as the bat- 
tery-powered lights that James 
had affixed to her began to wink 
on, for the deep red-violet dusk 
had already fallen and the first 
moon was rising. “Have you 
thought, Mrs. Haut, that if you 
fruit today, it will save the ex- 
pense of another festival?” 

“I don’t expect to fruit for an- 
other two months,” Phyllis said 



THE VENUS TRAP

coldly, “and why shouldn’t we 
have another festival? We can 
afford it and I like parties. I 
haven’t been to one since the day 
I landed.” 

“Is the life out here getting a 
little quiet for you, petiole?” the 
tree asked solicitously. “It must 
be hard when one has no intel- 
lectual resources upon which to 
draw.” 

P HYLLIS held her peace for 
ten seconds; then, “I wonder 
where those boys can be,” she 
said. “I hope they bring some 
pickles along. I asked to have 
some sent, but I’m accustomed to 
having no attention paid to what 
I want.” 

“There’s a surprise coming for 



you, Phyllis,” James could not 
help telling her again, hoping to 
arouse some semblance of inter- 
est. “Something I know you’ll 
love . And for you, too,” he 
said courteously to Magnolia. 

“You mean the same surprise 
for both, or a surprise apiece?” 
the tree asked. 

“Oh, one for each, of course.” 

“I see the lights of the ’copter 
now!” Phyllis cried and, running 
out into the middle of the lawn, 
began waving her handkerchief. 
He hadn’t seen her so pleasantly 
excited for a long time. 

“I don’t suppose I’ll need to 
turn on the landing lights,” he 
said to Magnolia. “You should 
do the trick.” 

“Am I all finished?” she rustled 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




anxiously. “I do wish I could see 
myself. How do I look?” 

“Splendid. I’ve never had as 
beautiful a Christmas tree as you, 
Maggie,” he told her with com- 
plete honesty. “Not even on 
Earth.” 

“I’m glad, Jim, but I still wish 
I could be more to you than just 
a Christmas tree.” 

“Shh. The others might hear.” 
For the helicopter had landed 
and the visitors were pouring out, 
with shouts of admiration. Not 
only the bachelors had come — 
and in full force — but some of 
the older men from Base, who 
apparently felt they could man- 
age to do without their wives for 
twelve hours, even if those hours 
included Christmas Eve. He won- 



dered where he and Phyllis could 
put them all, but some could sleep 
outside, if need be, for it was 
never cold on Elysium. The winds 
were gentle and the rains light 
and fragrant. 

TSTHILE the visitors were 
” crowding around Phyllis and 
the tree, James rooted eagerly 
through the packages they had 
brought, until he found what he 
wanted. Then he rushed over to 
the group. “I know I should wait 
until tomorrow, but I want to 
give the girls their presents now.” 
The other men smiled sympa- 
thetically, almost as joyful as he. 
“Merry Christmas, Magnolia!” 
He hoped Phyllis would under- 
stand that it was etiquette which 



THE VENUS TRAP 



99 



dictated that the alien life-form 
should get her gift first. 

“Thank you,” the tree said, “I 
am deeply touched. I don’t be- 
lieve anyone ever gave me a pres- 
ent before. What is it?” 

“Liquid plant food — vitamins 
and minerals, you know. For you 
to drink.” 

“What fun!” she exclaimed in 
pretty excitement. “Pour some 
over me right now!” 

“Not so fast, Jim, boy!” Dr. 
Cutler, the biologist, snatched the 
jug from James’ hand. “First you- 
all better let me take a sample 
of this here stuff back to Base to 
test on a lower life-form, so’s I 
can make sure it won’t do any- 
thing bad to Miss Magnolia. 
Might have iron in it and I have 
a theory that iron may not be 
beneficial for the local vegeta- 
tion.” 

“Oh, thank you!” the tree rus- 
tled. “It’s so very thoughtful of 
you, Doctor, but I’m sure Jim 
would never give me anything 
that would injure me.” 

“I’m sure he isn’t fixing to do 
a thing like that, ma’am, but he’s 
no botanist.” 

“And for you, Phyllis . .” 
James handed his wife the awk- 
ward bundle to unwrap for her- 
self. 

She tore the papers off slowly. 
“Oh, Jim, darling, it’s — it’s — ” 

“You wanted a bit of green, so 
I ordered a plant from Earth. 

100 



You like it? I hope you do.” 
“Oh, Jiml” She embraced him 
and the pot simultaneously. 
“More than anything !” 

“It won’t stay green,” Magnolia 
observed. “Either it’ll turn blue 
or it’ll die. Puny-looking speci- 
men, isn’t it?” 

“Well,” said James, “it’s only 
a youngster. I guess this Christ- 
mas is too early, but next Christ- 
mas there ought to be berries. 
It’s a holly plant, Phyl.” 

“Holly,” she repeated, her voice 
shaking a little. “Holly.” She and 
Dr. Cutler exchanged glances. 

“I told you, Miz Phyllis, ma’am 
— he may know the first thing 
about botany, but he doesn’t 
know anything after that.” 

“Jim,” Phyllis said, linking her 
free arm through his, “I mis- 
judged you. Dr. Cutler is right. 
You don’t know so very much 
about botany, after all.” 

TIE LOOKED at her blankly. 

Her voice was trembling, 
and not with tears this time. “I 
love this little plant; it’s just 
what I wanted . but there 
aren’t ever going to be any ber- 
ries, because, to have berries, 
you have to have two plants. 
And the right two. Holly’s di — 
dio — it’s just like us.” 

“Oh,” James said, feeling thor- 
oughly inadequate. “I’m sorry.” 
“But you mustn’t be sorry. I’m 
going to plant it here on Elysium, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and I hope it will stay green in 
spite of what she says, and it’ll 
have blossoms anyway . and it 
was very, very sweet of you, 
dear.” 

She kissed his cheek. 

“Is this one a boy or a girl?” 
Magnolia asked. 

“You-all can’t tell till it blooms, 
Miss Magnolia, ma’am,” Dr. Cut- 
ler informed her. 

“Maybe I can. Hand it up here, 
please.” 

Phyllis paused for an irreso- 
lute moment, then, smiling ner- 
vously at her guests, obliged. 

“It’s a boy,” Magnolia an- 
nounced, after a minute. “A boy.” 
She gave back the pot reluctantly. 
“Phyllis,” she said, “you and I 
have never been friends and I 
admit that it’s been my fault just 
as much as yours.” 

“As much as mine?” Phyllis 
echoed. “I like that — ” and was 
going to go on when she obvi- 
ously recollected that they had 
company, and stopped. 

“So I know it’s presumptuous 
of me to ask you a favor.” 

“Yes, Magnolia?” Phyllis said, 
her fine cornsilk eyebrows arched 
a trifle. “What is this favor?” 

‘When you plant the little fel- 
low — you said you were going 
to, anyhow — would you plant 
him near me?” 

Phyllis looked down at the 
plant she held cradled in her 
arms and then up at the tree. “Of 



cours§, Magnolia,” she said, 
frowning slightly. “I didn’t real- 
ize . .” Her voice began to trem- 
ble. “I have been pretty rotten, 
haven’t I?” She looked toward 
James, but he turned his glance 
away. 

“Just because you were a 
plant,” Phyllis continued, “didn’t 
mean I had to be a b-b-beast It 
must have been awful for you, 
seeing me like this, practically 
crowing over you, and knowing 
that you yourself would never 
have the chance to be a m-m-m- 
mother.” 

“‘Full many a flower is born 
to blush unseen,’ ” Magnolia said 
sadly, “‘and waste its sweetness 
on the desert air.’” 

"D HYLLIS was crying un- 
ashamedly now. “I’ll plant him 
right next to you — Maggie. I 
want you to have him. He can be 
your baby.” 

“Thank you, Phyl,” Maggie 
said softly. “That’s very . blue 
of you." 

“Although I think that’s a jim- 
dandy idea,” the biologist said, 
“and I sure wouldn’t want to do 
anything to discourage it, being 
real interested in the results of 
an experiment like that my own 
self, I don’t think you ought to 
feel so mean about it, Miz Phyl- 
lis. If all she wanted — begging 
your pardon, Miss Magnolia, 
ma’am — was a baby, why didn’t 



THE VENUS TRAP 



101 




she take an interest in the holly 
until she found out it was a male? 
Why wouldn’t a little old girl 
holly have done as well?” 

“Why — why, you scheming 
vegetable!” Phyllis exploded at 
Magnolia, clutching the holly 
plant to her protective bosom. 
“He’s much too young for you, 
and I’m going to plant him far 
away, where he can’t possibly 
fall into your clutches.” 

“Now, Miss Phyllis, we-all 
mustn’t look at things out of their 
proper perspective.” 

“Then why did you take your 
hat off when you were introduced 
to Miss Magnolia, Cutler?” Dr. 
Lakin asked interestedly. 

“Sir, where I come from, we 
respect femininity, whether it be 
animal, vegetable or mineral. 
Nonetheless, we-all got to remem- 
ber, though Miss Magnolia is un- 
questionably a lady, she is not a 
woman.” 

Phyllis began to laugh hysteri- 
cally. “You’re right!” she gasped. 
“I had almost forgotten she was 
only a tree. And that it is only a 
little Christmas holly plant that’s 
probably going to die, anyway — 
they almost always do.” 

“That’s cruel, Phyllis,” James 
said, “and you know it is.” 

“Do you really think I’m 
cruel? Are you going to tell the 
Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Vegetables on me? 
But why am I cruel? I’m giving 

102 



her the holly. That’s what she 
wants, isn’t it? Do you hear that, 
Miss Magnolia, ma’am? He’s all 
yours. We’ll plant him next to 
you — right away. And I hope he 
doesn’t die. I hope he grows up to 
make you a good husband.” 

UOHE’S really quite remark- 

^ able,” Dr. Lakin said to 
James later that same evening, 
after the planting ceremonies 
were over and the rest of the 
party had gone into the cottage 
for fresh coffee and more sand- 
wiches and cookies and penuche. 
“Quite remarkable. You’re a 
lucky man, Haut.” 

“Thank you, sir,” James replied 
abstractedly. “I’m sure Phyllis 
will be pleased to — ” 

“Phyllisl Oh, Mrs. Haut is a 
very remarkable woman, of 
course. A handsome, strong girl; 
she’ll make a splendid mother, 
I’m sure. But I was referring to 
Miss Magnolia. She’s a credit to 
you, my boy. If for no other rea- 
son, your name will go down in 
the history of our colony as that 
of the guide and mentor of Miss 
Magnolia. That’s quite a tree you 
have there.” 

James looked at the dark form 
of the tree — for the lights had 
been turned out — silhouetted 
against the three pale moons and 
the violet night. “Yes, she is,” he 
said. 

“You’re fortunate to be her 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




neighbor . , and her friend.” 
“Yes, I am.” 

“Well, I expect I’d better join 
the rest. Are you coming on in, 
Jim?” 

“In a little while, sir. I thought 
I’d — I wanted to have a word 
with Magnolia. I won’t be long,” 
“Of course, of course. I’m de- 
lighted to see that there is such 
an excellent relationship between 
you . Good night, Miss Magno- 
lia!” he called. 

“Good night, Dr. Lakin,” the 
tree replied, politely enough, but 
it was obvious that she was pre- 
occupied with her new charge, 
who stood as close to her as it 
was possible to plant him and yet 
allow room for him to grow. 

HTHE door closed. James walked 
across the lawn until he was 
quite near Magnolia. “Maggie,” 
he whispered, reaching out to 
touch her trunk — smooth it was, 
and hard, but he could feel the 
vibrant life pulsing inside it. Cer- 
tainly she was not a plant, not 
just a plant, even though she was 
a tree. She was a native of Ely- 
sium, neither animal nor vege- 
table, unique unto the planet, 
unique unto herself. “Maggie.” 
“Yes, Jim. Don’t you think his 
silhouette is so graceful there in 
the moonlight? He isn’t really 
puny — just frail.” 

“Maggie, you’re not serious 
about this holly?” 

THE VENUS TRAP 



“What do you mean?” And still 
he didn’t have her full attention. 
Woud he ever have it again? 

“Serious about raising him to 
be your — your — ” 

“Why not, Jim?” 

“It’s impossible.” 

“Is it? It certainly is far more 
possible with him, isn’t it? That 
much I understood from your 
zoology books.” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Besides, I have nothing to 
lose, have I?” 

“But even if it were possible, 
wouldn’t it be humiliating for 
you? The creature’s mindless!” 
Magnolia’s leaves rustled in the 
darkness. She was laughing — a 
little bitterly. “Your Phyllis isn’t 
your intellectual equal, Jim, and 
yet you say you love her and I 
suppose you do. Am I not enti- 
tled to my follies also?” 

But she couldn’t compare Phyl- 
lis to a holly plant! It was un- 
reasonable. 

“He may die, of course,” Mag- 
nolia said. “I’ve got to be pre- 
pared for that. The soil is differ- 
ent, the air is different, the sun 
is different. But the chances are, 
if he survives, he’ll turn blue. 
And if he turns blue, who knows 
what other changes might be 
brought about? Maybe the plants 
on your Earth aren’t inherently 
mindless, Jim. Maybe they just 
didn’t have a chance. ‘Know ye 
the land where the cypress and 



103 




myrtle are emblems of deeds 
that are done in their clime...?’ 
That land isn’t Earth, Jim, so it 
might just possibly be Elysium.” 

A GAIN he didn’t say anything. 
A *- What he wanted to say, he 
had no right to say, so he kept 
silent. 

“It’ll be a chance for me, too, 
Jim. At least we’re both plants, 
he and I. That gives us a head- 
start.” 

“Yes, I suppose it does.” 

“Intellect doesn’t count for 
much in the propagation of the 
species. Life goes on without re- 
gard for reason, and that’s mainly 
what we’re here for, to make sure 
that life goes on — if we’re here 
for anything at all. Thanks to 
your kind, Jim, life will continue 
on this planet; it will certainly 
be your kind of life — and I hope 
it can be ours as well.” 



“Yes,” he said. “I hope so, too.” 

And he did, but he wished it 
didn’t have to continue in quite 
that way. Perhaps it was a trick 
of the three moons, but the holly 
plant’s leaves seemed to have 
changed color.. They were no 
longer green, but almost blue — 
powder blue. 

“You’d best be getting on to 
your party, Jim,” Magnolia said. 
“You wouldn’t want to be remiss 
in your duties as host. And please 
close the door gently when you 
go inside. The little holly plant’s 
asleep.” 

As he closed the door carefully 
behind him, he heard a burst of 
laughter coming from the kitchen, 
where the guests apparently had 
assembled — raucous animal 
laughter — and, rising shrill and 
noisy above it, Phyllis’s company 
laugh.

NO BOUNDARIES by Henry 
Kuttner and C. L. Moore. Bal- 
lantine Books, 35c 

A CCORDING to the brief bi- 
ography at the rear of this 
book, the Kuttners have stopped 
writing under myriad pseudo- 
nyms. 

High time, too. Fifty per 
cent of active readers were con- 
vinced that fifty per cent of ac- 
tive authors were the Kuttners. 

This collection is representa- 
tive of their talent for creating 
and maintaining mood as in “Vin- 
tage Season,” “Two-Handed En- 

★ ★★★★ shelf 



gine” and “The Devil We Know:” 
with the rollicking “Exit the Pro- 
fessor” thrown in as a change of 
pace. “Home There’s No Return- 
ing” is the only low mark in the 
book, but suffers more through 
comparison with its companions 
than through faults of its own. 

The previously mentioned 
brief biography is a little gem of 
wit and information. The author 
of that should not remain anony- 
mous or pseudonymous. 

Recommendation? You should 
read it. 

The Kuttners should get back 
into production again!

MARTIANS, GO HOME by 
Fredric Brown. E. P. Dutton & 
Co., Inc., $2.75 

B ROWN claims that all writers 
since Wells have overlooked 
the obvious. Martians are not 
huge-chested spindles, pink liz- 
ards or any of the other innu- 
merable shapes pictured by sci- 
ence fiction. They really are Lit- 
tle Green Men! 

The story’s hero, a science fic- 
tion writer named Luke Dever- 
eaux, retires to a California des- 
ert shack to recover his writing 
touch miles from civilization. He 
thinks he is unique, therefore, 
when he is visited by a two-and- 
a-half-foot green Martian who 
turns out to be as nasty an indi- 
vidual as you never met. 

It develops, however, that all 
over Earth at the same instant, 
a billion Martians have made 
themselves obnoxiously known. 
They “kwimmed” to Earth and 
that is the extent of the informa- 
tion that they will impart. For 
the rest, being of basically cruel 
nature, they deliberately cause 
nervous breakdowns, suicides and 
destruction of world economy. 

Fortunately, they are visible 
and audible only, not otherwise 
material. Also, they appear and 
disappear at will, do not use in- 
dividual names, and address all 
males as “Mack” and all females 
as “Toots.” Their knowledge of 

106 



idiomatic language is fantastic 
and their interest in the human 
sex life insatiable. Unfortunately, 
they possess both night and X- 
ray vision, so that the human 
birthrate falls off alarmingly the 
first year of their invasion, even 
in France. 

There are spots where the au- 
thor got carried away by his nar- 
rative, but he succeeded in writ- 
ing a very funny book. 

THE WORLD WE LIVE IN by 
the Editorial Staff of Life and 
Lincoln Barnett. Time Inc., and 
Simon & Schuster, Inc., $13.50 

rpHIS large, handsome book 
contains the complete series 
which ran in Life in thirteen in- 
stallments for over two years. If 
you were one of those who at- 
tempted to save the individual is- 
sues in which it appeared, only 
to have pages ripped and lost 
and copies mislaid, you will be 
happy to have this permanent 
record. 

For those who have never 
seen it in periodical form, I> 
quote the introduction by Van- 
nevar Bush, wartime Chief of the 
Office of Scientific Research and 
Development: 

“It is not a treatise but a mod- 
est volume of text richly illus- 
trated which will captivate the 
imagination of millions of non- 
scientific people who would not 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




otherwise concern themselves 
with its subject matter.” 

I heartily agree. The illustra- 
tions are profuse and magnificent. 
The text is inclined to floweri- 
ness, but it doesn’t get in the way 
of the pictures, which are guar- 
anteed to absorb the interest. 

The total time covered by the 
contents is some fifty billion 
years, from the birth of Earth 
four to five billion years ago, to 
the heat death of the Sun thirty 
to fifty billion years in the fu- 
ture. 

Altogether, it’s as intriguing a 
natural history book as I’ve ever 
seen under • one cover and more 
than adequately proves the truth 
of the old saw about one picture 
being worth at least a thousand 
words. 

MAN AND THE WINDS by E. 
Auhert de la Rue. Philosophical 
Library, $6.00 

T^VERYONE knows how the 
wind has influenced history 
through the invention of the sail 
and, of course, these days the en- 
tire world watches the path of a 
modern hurricane or typhoon, 
but how many people know the 
intimate story of local winds and 
their influence in subtle ways on 
human life? 

The author takes us to many 
localities, mainly European, 
where virtually the entire behav- 

★ ★ ★ ★ ★ SHEIF 



ior of the inhabitants has been 
determined by the vagaries of at- 
mospheric disturbances. 

According to the jacket, the 
publishers believe this to be the 
first book written on the winds 
as they affect mankind. It doesn’t 
need that distinction to qualify 
as a rewarding book on an unu- 
sual subject. 

EXPERIMENTS IN THE 
PRINCIPLES OF SPACE 
TRAVEL by Franklyn M. Bran- 
ley. Thomas Y. Crowell Com- 
pany, $2.00 

r I 'HE author, a science teacher 
in a New Jersey college, is 
also the author of two science 
fiction juveniles, Lodestar: 
Rocket Ship to Mars and Mars. 
The present book, addressed to 
the 12-year-and-up audience, is 
a brain-prodding exposition of 
the problems Man must expect 
to arise from his projected first 
trip into space. 

From the first chapter on the 
question of destinations to the 
last concerning the problem of 
gravity, the author sustains in- 
terest, not only with his text, but 
with the demonstrative experi- 
ments he suggests. 

I found that my young son, 
Ricky, was not only eager but 
capable of conducting the experi- 
ments with the simple household 
materials the author suggests.

MEN, MICROSCOPES AND 
LIVING THINGS by Katherine 
B. Shippen. The Viking Press, 
$3.00 

r 1 1 HIS intimately written book 
concerns itself with the vital 
discoveries of men who were 
forerunners in their fields, from 
Aristotle, the first biologist, 
through Darwin, and down to 
Weismann and Morgan, of gene 
and chromosome fame. 

Each vignette, and there are a 
score of them, records the high- 
lights in the lives of men who 
changed biology from supersti- 
tion to the science it is today. 

The book is handsomely illus- 
trated in line by Anthony Ravi- 
elli. It is intended for teen-age 
audiences, but even a well-in-

THE MOON by H. P. Wilkins 
and Patrick Moore. The MacMil- 
lan Company, $12.00 

"DOTH authors are Fellows of 
the Royal Astronomical Soci- 
ety. In addition, Dr. Wilkins is 
director of the Lunar Section of 
the British Astronomical Associa- 
tion and Moore is its secretary. 
With that background, the reader 
can expect as authoritative a 
book on the subject as can be 
published. He is not disappointed. 

The book features — and, in 

108 



mous revised 300-inch lunar map 
fact, is built around — the fa- 
of Dr. Wilkins. To those readers 
who are not familiar with the 
map, it is possibly the most de- 
tailed record of the Moon’s face 
in existence. 

The introduction takes the 
reader from the history of Selen- 
ography to a general survey of 
surface details and classification, 
and speculates on the causation 
of observed changes which would 
tend to prove that the Moon is 
not in a state Of suspended ani- 
mation. 

The following twenty-five sec- 
tions deal with the individual 
portions of the map as segmented 
by the authors. As they state, the 
book is meant primarily for ob- 
servers. However, anyone who 
has ever looked at the Moon 
with appreciation will find the 
book a source of provocative in- 
formation. Besides marvelously 
detailed sections of the map, 
there are fine lunar photographs 
and enlarged drawings of some 
of the more spectacular features. 

There follows a series of ap- 
pendices, the most valuable of 
which covers lunar photography, 
a subject which the amateur 
knows through sad experience is 
badly neglected. If the reader 
ever intends to purchase a tele- 
scope, this book will serve both 
as incentive and guide.

The Moralist 



By JACK TAYLOR 

Aye, 'tis a difficult thing 
to be a lady on a far world 
— but who needs them there? 



Illustrated by WEISS 



T HERE ARE exceptions to 
almost every rule and 
Xenon was one of them. 
The rule in this particular case 
was the old cataloguers’ adage 
that cataloguing duty was never 
pleasant, often dangerous and al- 
ways hard. Xenon is the fourth 
planet of one of the stars investi- 
gated some seven or eight years 
ago by the battleship Terra on 
her swing around the edge of the 
Black Hole. 

Unequipped for exploration, 
the Terra hadn’t bothered to land 
on the planet, but instead had 



taken only the usual gravitational 
and atmosphere readings and 
then had continued on her long 
mapping patrol. She had slowed 
just long enough to send back 
her report on tight beam to 
Venus Relay Station and propose 
the name of Xenon, “the un- 
known.” After all, a planet with 
point nine Earth gravity and al- 
most twenty per cent oxygen in 
its atmosphere was well worth a 
name rather than a number. 

About a year later, the pre- 
liminary exploration ship arrived 
and spent several weeks mapping

and testing this, that and the 
other thing. Then she went home 
and wrote her report — and what 
a report it was! The thing read 
like a Chamber of Commerce 
bulletin that had been sponsored 
by a subdivider. All it needed 
was a couple of ads offering some 
choice business locations for sale 
and it would have been complete. 

The planet was perfect, the 
climate was perfect, the soil fer- 
tile. There were no natives or 
hostile life to bother a man. The 
forests were wide, the plains were 
broad and the numerous rivers 
were not only full of fish but also 
emptied into blue seas that were 
just as full of fish as the rivers. 
That report was enough to make 
a man quit his job and go to 
Xenon to start a chicken ranch 
or grow oranges. 

f T , HE BUREAU of Coloniza- 
tion acted with its usual 
speed. Three years later, a cata- 
loguing group landed from the 
supply ship Hunter. The duties 
of the groups are simple enough; 
they determine which of the food 
crops known to Man can best 
adapt themselves to the condi- 
tions found on the particular 
planet under examination. They 
list the native flora and fauna, 
minerals and resources. They 
chart the weather and its cycles 
and, in general, try to determine 
if Man can exist there and, if so, 

no 



if the planet is worth the expense, 
trouble and danger of coloniza- 
tion. 

Most planets are not worth it, 
but Xenon was. 

And now the group had re- 
turned with its final report and 
its recommendations. The report? 
Xenon was perfect, just perfect. 
The recommendations? Immedi- 
ate colonization, but be careful 
who is sent so that place isn’t 
spoiled by a bunch of land-grab- 
bing exploiters who might not 
appreciate the place. 

They had been back nearly a 
week before Lee Spencer had 
time to come to my place for the 
weekend. Due to a combination 
of my wife’s cooking and a seden- 
tary desk job with the Bureau, 
I was beginning to have a bit of 
difficulty in bending over far 
enough to zip on my shoes in 
the mornings, but Lee was still 
as lean and fit as he was the day 
he blasted off for Xenon nearly 
four years before. 

He had been given the full 
returned-hero treatment, com- 
plete with press conferences, tes- 
timonial dinner, audience with 
the Coordinator — everything. 
He hadn’t had a waking moment 
to himself since he landed, so I 
suppose that might have been 
one reason that he relaxed so 
completely in front of the library 
fire after dinner and talked more 
than he perhaps should have. Or 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the generous slug of the old 
brandy my grandfather left me 
may have had something to do 
with it. 

At any rate, he was in an ex- 
pansive mood that night after 
Martha had filled him with one 
of her always excellent dinners 
and I had nearly floated him in 
Grandfather’s brandy. 

We had a lot of “do you re- 
member” man talk to catch up 
on and after enduring nearly two 
hours of conversation about peo- 
ple and happenings of which she 
knew nothing, Martha gave up 
and headed for the stairs. ' 

“You two can talk all night if 
you want,” she announced over 
her shoulder, “but I’m going to 
bed. Breakfast on the patio about 
nine or so, Lee.” 

“I’ll be there, Marty. Sleep 
tight.” 

“Not as tight as you will, I’ll 
bet,” she grinned. “There’s an- 
other jug in the kitchen if you 
think you may need it.” 

W E HEARD her bedroom 
door hiss as it slid closed 
and sat for a moment looking 
into the fire and listening to it 
whispering secrets to itself. 

“She’s a pretty nice wife, Sam,” 
he told me. 

“Thanks. I like her, too.” 

“Not at all like Prunella.” 
“Prunella?” I said. “I don’t 
think — ” 



“Well, that’s what the boys at 
the station began calling her a 
couple of days after she landed. 
Behind her back, of course.” 

“I still don’t know who — ” 
“You know, the niece of that 
windbag in World Congress that 
you featherheads in the front of- 
fice sent out to replace Pop Jen- 
sen when he fell out of that tree 
and had to be sent back to Earth 
for hospitalization.” 

“Oh, that one. Look, Lee, I 
didn’t have anything to do with 
her selection. She was appointed 
by the Old Man himself. Under- 
stand there was some kind of 
pressure on him from the top.” 

“I forgive you, Sam, but I 
rather doubt if some of the other 
people of the group will for a 
while.” 

“How come she didn’t stay?” I 
asked. “Political pressure or not, 
I can’t imagine the supervisors 
sending out an incompetent re- 
placement.” 

“Incompetent?” he almost 
snorted. “Prunella was the most 
belligerently competent female 
that it has ever been my misfor- 
tune to run across. Prunella was 
efficiency personified, make no 
mistake about that. She was — 
or is — a top-flight botanist and 
had led several expeditions here 
on Earth, but she couldn’t realize 
that Xenon wasn’t Earth. She 
tried to live by the book as she 
had here, but in spite of the gen- 

lu 



THE MORALIST 




eral excellence of the Spaceman’s 
Handbook, her methods didn’t 
work so well.” 

I primed him with another 
two fingers out of the bottle and 
sat back to listen. 

“Good brandy,” he said. “I 
made some once on Xenon, but 
Prunella put a halt to that in a 
hurry, just as she did a lot of 
other things. The trouble with 
her was that she was always in- 
sufferably right. Every blasted 
time! And she was right again 
when she pointed out that if we 
were to come under attack, the 
products of the little distillery 
might impair our efforts to de- 
fend ourselves. My still went un- 
der the ax.” 

| I E SIGHED and then went 
on. “She neglected to say 
what might attack us or where 
this enemy might come from, 
since men are the only animals 
to achieve space flight thus far 
and there was nothing on Xenon 
that was hostile to us. 

“But I’m getting ahead of my 
story,” he told his glass. “It prob- 
ably all started when she arrived. 
We had been looking forward to 
the day, but none of us more than 
Joe, our cook. Joe was that rare 
find, a man who took pride in his 
work and worked with pride. Joe, 

I firmly believe, could barbecue 
a spaceman’s boot so that it 
would taste like steak. He con- 

112 



sidered Prunella and her arrival 
a fine opportunity to show what 
he could do when he really 
wanted to. 

“For her first meal with us, 
Joe had prepared Prunella a feed 
from every edible native fruit, 
vegetable and meat that he could 
lay his hands on. It was the same 
stuff that we had been getting 
fat on for nearly two years, but 
did we eat any of his cooking 
that night? Not a bite,” he an- 
swered himself.— “I thought she 
was going to toss a fit right there 
and then. 

“ ‘Gentlemen,’ she said, ‘you 
know as well as I that consump- 
tion of any native product of a 
strange planet is expressly for- 
bidden by the Spaceman’s Hand- 
book of Survival until these 
products have been thoroughly 
investigated and passed upon by 
the proper authorities. Therefore, 
we shall eat the synthetics that 
have been provided for us until 
these have been examined by the 
labs on Earth.’ 

“She was right, of course,” Lee 
went on. “Many poor devils have 
died in agony because they were 
foolish enough to eat some lus- 
cious-looking fruit before it had 
been checked. We tried to tell 
her that our lab monkeys and 
cats had eaten and liked every- 
thing on the table, as had we, but 
we still had to send samples to 
Earth. That was two years ago 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





THE MORALIST 




and they still haven’t handed 
back a report.” 

He sighed again and this time 
didn’t wait for me to pour for 
him. 

“So we ate synthetics, but you 
know how they are — every mor- 
sel filled to the brim with every- 
thing a man needs to live on 
indefinitely, except one thing — 
taste. It almost broke Joe’s spirit, 
he fixed the stuff for us in every 
way known to mortal Man. No 
matter how thin he sliced it, it 
was still synthetic and still had 
that flavor of a well-aged glue- 
pot.” 

Lee ran his tongue over his 
lips, as though the taste were still 
in his mouth. "There were count- 
less little incidents such as that,” 
he said, “none of them important, 
but they all added up to a con- 
stant irritation and resentment 
among the men. Maybe it was 
easygoing Pop Jensen who 
spoiled us. I don’t know.” 

L EE THOUGHT for a moment 
or two. “Then there was the 
time a water-pup nuzzled Prun- 
ella while she was taking a lone 
swim in the river that ran near 
the station. She spent all morning 
on a sandbar in the middle of the 
river before the school of pups 
tired of their play and left long 
enough for her to consider it safe 
enough to swim back to the river 
bank.” 



He grinned to himself. “Sam, 
those pups are as harmless and 
friendly and playful as any pups 
of Earth, but Prunella didn’t 
know that and none of us could 
convince her of it. She said that 
the pups might be dangerous, 
under some unknown circum- 
stances which she didn’t define, 
then quoted us a passage from 
the Handbook which prohibited 
fraternization with any native 
life-forms until friendly relations 
were established. She evidently 
didn’t consider being nuzzled a 
friendly act. Ergo, no more swim- 
ming and that was an order.” 

He made another trip to the 
brandy bottle, then sank back 
into the deep chair again. “But 
the most exasperating thing 
Prunella pulled on us was the 
inspections every morning before 
we left on our daily field trips. 
We had all been on Xenon long 
enough to know what equipment 
we needed to carry, right down to 
the last specimen box, but what 
we carried and what the Survival 
Handbook said to carry were two 
different things. That is, they 
were two different things before 
Prunella began her inspections. 
We had found long before that 
all of the gear prescribed by the 
Handbook was heavy, most of it 
was useless, none of it necessary 
on Xenon. It might be of some 
use on some other planet, but we 
didn’t need it there. So, as a con- 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




sequence, we didn’t lug much of 
that junk around over the land- 
scape with us.” 

“None of it?” I said. 

“Well, almost none. But after 
Little Miss Efficiency began mak- 
ing her morning spot checks, we 
left the compound each day look- 
ing like a picture of what the 
well-dressed man on a strange 
planet will wear. We carried 
everything in the book and a few 
more that Pruny thought up all 
by her little self. In addition to 
all the survival, signaling and 
first-aid equipment that dangled 
and jangled from various parts 
of us, we also carried enough 
offensive and defensive weapons 
to start and maintain a war of no 
small size. 

“Granted, the first-aid and 
radio paraphernalia might be 
handy in some way, but blasters, 
needle-guns, knives, defense 
shields and all the other appara- 
tus struck as being a little on the 
ridiculous side, especially since 
neither we nor the men before 
us had found a single life-form 
on Xenon that would attack Man. 
Or rather, with one exception, 
none of them would and a blaster 
or needle-gun was of no use on 
that one.” 

T FOLLOWED my cue. “Real- 
ly? And what was this mysteri- 
ous exception?” I thought I was 
playing straight man for some 



elaborate joke, but Lee was 
serious. 

“Damn it all, don’t you people 
even read your own directives? 
I’m talking about the powder 
puffs. Does that mean anything 
to you?” 

Seeing my blank look, he ex- 
plained resignedly, “The powder 
puffs are the way the Xenon 
equivalent of Earthly mushrooms 
takes to spread its spores. They 
have some unpronounceable 
Latin name, but we called them 
powder puffs because, oddly 
enough, that’s what they looked 
like. The puffs are little round 
balls of a very light fluffy ma- 
terial, with the spores adhering 
to small fibers on the surface. 
The things are carried by the 
winds over great distances hnd 
when they finally come down, 
they bump along, leaving a dust- 
ing of spores on anything they 
touch.” 

“They don’t sound very dan- 
gerous,” I told him. 

“They aren’t then. It’s the next 
step in their life cycle that makes 
them a nuisance. You see, Sam, 
if they don’t come in contact with 
some substance containing mois- 
ture and a high percentage of 
nitrogen, the spores lie dormant. 
Can you think of any substance 
fitting those requirements better 
than a nice warm mess of living 
protein?” 

He grinned at me ghoulishly. 



THE MORALIST

“Don’t look so horrified, Sam. I’ll 
bet credits against chalk that 
you’re host to at least one kind 
of fungus right now. Do you have 
athlete’s foot?” 

He was thirsty again and took 
steps to remedy such a deplor- 
able situation. “The puffs are only 
another type of fungus, even 
though they do cause more 
trouble than most. The animals 
on Xenon are immune from them, 
but when they land on a man, 
they send out tiny rootlets that 
are like minute hairs. These go 
into the nearest capillary and 
start taking the nitrogen they 
need from the blood. After a 
week or so, they drop off and 
continue their cycle. I’m told that 
a man can be practically covered 
with the varmits and his nitrogen 
balance won’t be disturbed 
enough to bother him.” 

“Then why worry about them?” 
I asked as he paused a moment. 

He didn’t seem to hear me. 
“Those puffs would be just an- 
other annoyance except for the 
fact that those little rootlets evi- 
dently work on the nerve endings 
of the body just enough so they 
don’t hurt but itch instead and, 
brother, how they do itch! Makes 
you wish you had four more 
hands and someone else to help 
scratch.” 

He squirmed in remembrance. 
“I understand some of the earlier 
men dug out divots of flesh to 

116 



get rid of the intolerable itch and 
to keep from going crazy. It’s 
that bad. Good thing, though, 
that the spores can’t live inside 
the body. Can you imagine hav- 
ing an itch like that in your 
lungs?” 

A MOTHER sip and then he 
continued. “You’ll forgive 
me if I seem to wander from La 
Prunella, but you have to under- 
stand the powder puffs to know 
why she left our bed and board 
so suddenly. 

“Of course, it’s true all of the 
old-timers on Xenon had been 
puffed at one time or another, 
but just to prevent a repeat per- 
formance, we all, including 
Prunella, wore that protective 
goo you people sent out to us a 
few years ago. Works pretty well. 
You build up a considerable im- 
munity after the first attack of 
puffs and more after each suc- 
ceeding one, but that’s the hard 
way. The goo is easier.” His voice 
trailed off as, with a surprised 
look, he noticed his glass, was 
again empty. This time he 
brought the bottle back with him. 
“But to get back to Pruny. Well, 
the men were getting pretty fed 
up with Prunella’s arbitrary ways 
and her morning inspections, but 
the last straw was when she shot 
Johnny, the station’s pet Me-too 
bird that we had raised from al- 
most an egg. Same as humans, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Johnny had his little faults and 
foibles, but we loved him in spite 
of them. 

“One of those faults was the 
reason Johnny lived outside the 
dome instead of inside with the 
rest of us, as he would have liked. 
We never let him stay inside for 
any length of time because he 
was never able to understand 
why floors should be clean and 
kept that way. So Johnny’s nest 
was on top of the ultra-wave 
tower and that’s where he spent 
most of his time when he wasn’t 
lazily riding around on the 
shoulders of one of us or pan- 
handling Joe, the cook, for some- 
thing extra to eat. 

“He was in his nest when 
Prunella got him with that deli- 
cate-looking, deadly little needle- 
gun of hers. I’ll bet he had a 
hundred of those tiny slivers of 
steel in him. One would have 
been enough, but she must have 
set the gun on full automatic and 
then let it spew itself empty.” 

I made sympathetic noises. 

“She said afterward that John- 
ny had been a possible disease 
carrier and, besides, he was dirty. 
There was absolutely no doubt 
about it — Johnny was dirty 
and in more ways than one, but 
as for diseases, Xenon seemed to 
have none that the human race 
hadn’t already overcome on some 
other planet far more dangerous 
than this one.” 

THE MORALIST 



T LAID more wood on the fire 
as Lee paused to sip and roll 
the brandy. 

He said, “I’ve always suspect- 
ed, however, that the real reason 
for Johnny’s assassination struck 
Prunella, so to speak, like a bolt 
from the blue when she walked 
under his nest in the tower. At 
any rate, I saw her shoving her 
shirt into the disposer chute. 
Johnny had one bad habit and 
all of us knew better than to get 
within his range, but Prunella, 
being new with us, just didn’t 
understand that bird,” 

He stopped, twirling his empty 
glass suggestively, with painful 
memories obviously clouding his 
eyes while he stared into the hyp- 
notically flickering fire. 

“Empty,” he said mournfully, 
“just as my heart was.” He bowed 
his head to Johnny’s memory as 
I hastily left him alone with his 
grief. I quickly returned from the 
kitchen, bringing a fresh supply 
of the medicinal spirits that 
Grandfather had advised for mo- 
ments of stress and, over Lee’s 
feeble protests, forced a generous 
dosage into his glass. He regard- 
ed it with a wan, pathetic smile, 
then, at my urging, choked back 
his sorrow and nearly drained 
the goblet in a manful gulp. 
Grandfather was right. The sor- 
row left Lee’s eye and from 
somewhere he found new courage 
to go on. 

117 




"The death of the bird seemed 
to crystalize the rebellion. That 
night, the entire personnel of the 
station unanimously elected 
themselves as joint chairmen of 
the Ways and Means Committee 
of the Xenon Anti-Prunella and 
After - sundown Elbow - bending 
League and immediately called 
a special meeting. The emergency 
session convened around a keg 
of my illegal brandy which, in 
some miraculous manner, had 
escaped Prunella’s searching 
hatchet. Not wishing to offend 
the unknown gods who had thus 
smiled upon us, we took small 
token sips as we meditated.” 

Lee demonstrated with the 
glass in his hand. “How to throw 
off the yoke of the oppressor who 
had come among us? How to ease 
the bite of her lash on our quiver- 
ing backs? How to restore our 
tiny, inoffensive still whose musi- 
cal, tinkling drip we loved so 
well? The suggestions put before 
the committee that night were 
many and varied and wonderful.” 
Lee tried to light a cigarette 
and nearly broiled the end of his 
nose with the flame. 

“Lopez, head of our camera 
team, wanted to pickle her in a 
barrel of brandy and send her 
back to Venus Relay Station 
aboard the next courier rocket. 
Sounded like a good idea, too, 
until Olsen, one of the biologists, 
objected on the grounds that 

118 



those bums on Venus never did 
anything for us, so why should 
they get all that good brandy? 
The motion was tabled as imprac- 
tical when we saw the pit into 
which Lopez and his wild ideas 
had nearly led us. A whole barrel 
of brandy! The man must have 
been desperate to call for such 
extreme measures.” 

XTE SHOOK his head. “Aker- 
mann, the chemist of the 
bunch, proposed smoking her as 
one would a ham and then hang- 
ing her over the main gate of the 
compound to keep away the 
beasties and things that go boomp 
in the night. Now that was what 
I thought a fine idea. Functional, 
you might say. Might as well get 
some good out of her. But then 
Joe smothered it with his obser- 
vation that, after one look at that 
face of hers, the good beasties 
would stay out of the compound, 
too. 

“The dark and devious ways 
of the plotter were difficult for 
us to assume, scientists and tech- 
nicians that we were, and the 
trips to the keg became more fre- 
quent as we sought the aid of 
the nameless gods who had sent 
it to us.” He paused again as 
Grandpa’s brandy took another 
beating. “The web of our own 
fuzzy thinking was entangling us 
more and more when I was privi- 
leged to be present during the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




only true flash of genius I’ve ever 
witnessed.” 

The wonder, the awe was still 
in his voice. “Akermann’s assist- 
ant, the Kid, was singled out for 
the touch and I must say for him 
that he held up very nicely under 
the blow, but one could see that 
his sudden responsibility set 
heavy on his narrow bony 
shoulders. The Kid drew addi- 
tional inspiration from the glass 
in his hand, then leaped to his 
feet and as promptly sat down 
again. He gave the decking at his 
feet a baleful glare and tried 
again, first choosing his footing 
carefully as a man should when 
the floor shows that alarming 
tendency to tilt.” 

“‘Men,’ he said owlishly, ‘le’s 
fix it show see — I mean so she 
— won’t like it here an’ maybe 
she’ll go ’way. Le’s set the puffs 
on her.’ 

“ ‘On her what?’ someone 
wanted to know. 

“‘On her nuthin’. Just on her!’ 
the Kid said. 

“‘Oh.’ 

“There was another mass as- 
sault on the speedily diminishing 
supply of illicit brandy while the 
committee prayed to the gods of 
the spacemen for guidance. The 
committee decided to consider 
the motion. 

“ ‘Wunnerful idea,’ Akermann 
beamed at his protege, ‘but how 
you gonna get ’em to bite through 



that protective goo she dunks 
herself in every mornin’. Just how 
you gonna, huh?’" 

T NODDED. “How about that?” 
I asked Lee. 

“The Kid was ready with an 
answer. ‘Do y’ know why we wear 
clothes made only of vegetable 
or synthetic fibers and not any 
animal wool, hide or fur?’ 

“‘Sure, any fool knows that,’ 
Akermann said. ‘The cotton lobby 
had a law passed.’ 

“ ‘I’m serious,’ the Kid told him 
disgustedly. 

“‘Howdy,’ our learned chemist 
said happily, sticking out his 
hand. ‘I’m Akermann.’ 

“The Kid must have finally 
decided that his boss was even 
more advanced in brandy shock 
than he was if it was possible — 
and it was. He picked another 
chemist, Harry North, as his new 
straight man and, squinting one 
eye a bit in an effort to keep him 
in focus, said, ‘Harry, do you 
know why we don’t wear wool ’n 
stuff like that?’ 

“‘Sure,’ Harry answered. ‘The 
Handbook says animal fibers are 
protein an’ if the puffs get a foot- 
hold on any article of clothing 
made of ’em, then their rootlets 
c’n penetrate most any kind of 
goo an’ fasten into the guy that 
happens to be so stupid. Then 
someone has to give him the 
treatment to keep him from 



THE MORALIST 



119 




scratching right down to the liver 
an’ lights.’ 

“The Kid’s punch line was try- 
ing to get out so bad that he was 
about to blow a tube. “That’s 
right, Harry,’ he smiled patroniz- 
ingly. “Now if Prunella was to 
wear somethin’ like that, do y’ 
spose the puffs would get ’er?’ 

“Harry was still puzzled. ‘Sure 
they would, but she’s not gonna 
do it. Handbook says not to, n’ 
even gives a long list of stuff not 
to wear. Nope, she won’t.’ 

-‘“I know there’s a list, but one 
nitrogenous fiber didn’t get on it. 
Silk is a protein — fibroin — 
but it’s not on the list.’ 

‘“Silk? Why should silk be on 
the list?’ Martin, a big, beefy 
physicist, was red-faced and in- 
dignant. ‘It’s too expensive and 
fragile for ordinary wear an’ be- 
sides, no self-respecting spaceman 
l ever knew would be caught 
dead in a silk undershirt or a silk 
anything else! What d’you think 
those guys are, a bunch of women 
to go around wearing sil — ’ He 
stopped abruptly, staring at the 
Kid with something like awe. ‘Do 
you think we can get ’er into 
something made of silk?’ he asked 
humbly, as befits a man when 
he speaks to a superior being. 

“There was a respectful silence 
as the group waited for Mr. Paul- 
son, formerly the Kid, to speak. 

“Mr. Paulson clapped his hand 
over his mouth, said ‘Urp’ be- 

120 



tween his clenched fingers, turned 
a remarkable shade of green and 
looked about him like a trapped 
animal. A few of his admirers 
led him through a small door, no 
doubt to worship silently at his 
feet while he rested after his soul- 
shaking ordeal. It was clear that 
Mr. Paulson had given his all for 
the cause.” 

T EE SAID, ‘The door slid shut 
on Mr. Paulson’s pain-racked 
exit, its latching hiss drowned by 
the simultaneous demand of the 
committee, individually, for the 
attention of the committee, col- 
lectively. Each of them consid- 
ered himself the sole person pres- 
ent capable of carrying on the 
great work for which Mr. Paul- 
son had so nobly sacrificed him- 
self. Ordinarily sedate doctors of 
this or that gibbered at each other 
in an arm-waving^ frenzied at- 
tempt to be heard. 

“In a matter of seconds, half 
the committee had the other half 
backed into chairs, against tables 
and into corners, earnestly ex- 
plaining in a conspiratorial roar 
just how Prunella was to be en- 
ticed into wearing the silken 
booby-trap. 

“The committee gradually 
shouted itself into a red-faced, 
thirsty semi-hoarseness only to 
find a demon — ne Shulman, 
our top botanist — guarding the 
inspirational keg with a heavy

stool and promising a swift and 
personal drought to any man 
who didn’t shut up on the spot. 
I need not say that we shut nor 
that order was fast in coming 
among us. 

“In the comparative quiet that 
followed, there was a rapid-fire 
shifting of ideas, deleting some, 
adding to others, and Prunella 
was doomed. The plot wasn’t too 
thick. It depended only on the 
fact that an expert’s eye was 
needed to detect the difference 
between sheer Enduron, the new- 
est and best of the synthetic 
fibers, and sheer silk. By the 
same token, the reverse was true. 
That is, given silk, one could 
easily mistake it for Enduron. 

“The services of a woman on 
Terra were necessary to us, so 
Sparks magnanimously recruited 
his young sister, a writer or artist 
or something of the sort, who 
lives somewhere in southern 
Europe. All she had to do was 
buy a dozen pairs of the fluffiest, 
frilliest, most outrageously femi- 
nine silk undies she could find 
in the most chi-chi shop in Paris 
and then send them to Prunella 
with a note honoring her as the 
first woman on Xenon and asking 
Prunella to accept them as a 
token of admiration from one 
woman to another. Some ficti- 
tious name was to be signed to it. 

“We raided the office, obtained 
Prunella’s file and copied out the 



proper measurements from it 
Sparks fed the message, measure- 
ments and a blank signed photo- 
check into the coder and the 
automatic ultra-wave transmitter 
took it with a swift blip of sound 
and that was that.” 

T WAITED for Lee to catch his 
* breath, which he did by in- 
haling from a full glass. Then he 
continued talking. 

“All this occurred about the 
middle of Xenon’s third month. 
We expected the skivies to arrive 
on a supply ship due the first of 
the following month, which gave 
us nearly three Earth weeks to 
wait, but we didn’t mind. After 
all, we had something to wait 
for. 

“The ship, bless the crew, was 
on schedule almost to the hour. 
Adams had had his wide-angle 
’scope aimed at the sky above 
Xenon since long before break- 
fast, and he and the detectors 
ran a dead heat when the ship 
winked out of sub-space about 
two million or so miles out. 

“By mid-morning, the ship’s 
gravitors had floated her into the 
field for the usual feather-light 
landing, and mail call, always the 
first order of business, was over. 

“Women have a well-deserved 
reputation for dawdling over 
trifles when important matters 
wait, but that morning Prunella 
broke all previous records. She 



THE MORALIST 



121 




gossiped with the ship’s captain 
about interminable bills of lad- 
ing, she inspected the field for 
any possible damage by the ship, 
she swallowed enough coffee to 
start a fair-sized shortage. Fin- 
ally, just in time to save the 
station from a mass nervous col- 
lapse, she left the office for her 
quarters, carrying her mail in 
one hand and that small, all-im- 
portant package in the other. 

“She reappeared for lunch 
wearing the tiny smile of a 
woman who knows she is appre- 
ciated by someone and, we hoped, 
also wearing something else not 
quite so visible. Never was one 
so closely watched by so many. 
If she looked distressed, we 
gloated. If she squirmed in her 
chair, we rejoiced. Her every 
move was analyzed for possible 
puff symptoms. 

“Prunella, that evening, dined 
as the captain’s guest aboard 
ship. In the mess hall, with Mr. 
Paulson installed in the seat of 
honor, the arguments were long, 
loud and heated: She had ’em 
on. She didn’t. The puffs had her. 
They didn’t. 

“I hadn’t realized there were 
so many synonyms for fool and 
idiot or so many genteel ways to 
sneer until my learned colleagues 
that night debated the case of 
the puffs versus Prunella. We 
went to bed still in an agony of 
indecision.” 



T EE WAITED for me to be 
appropriately sympathetic. I 
obliged. 

“The next morning, Prunella 
had breakfast alone in her quar- 
ters, but then she often did. Or 
I should say she ordered break- 
fast sent and then ate only a 
little of it and sent it back. A 
short while later, Prunella left 
her room, went to the library and 
returned to her quarters with a 
spool of microfilm in her hand. 
All the people who could cram 
into the tiny library cubicle were 
in before the hiss of Prunella’s 
closing door died away. A wild 
rape of the library files improved 
our digestions, dispositions and 
belief in the ultimate triumph of 
good over evil — Prunella had 
withdrawn the film on ‘Effects 
of Xenon Life-forms on the 
Human Body.’ 

“I learned later that some far- 
sighted soul had added lurid de- 
tails to the section of the film 
dealing with the puffs, describing 
minutely what one could expect 
after powder puff infestation. 
Odd thing about a few of those 
added details — some of the 
more horrible ones had never 
been noticed before nor have 
they been reported since. 

“Prunella went aboard the sup- 
ply ship Hunter shortly after 
noon, scratching determinedly in 
several places that no lady 
should, at least in public.

“The captain, most of his load- 
ing done and seeing her dire 
nefed, blasted off for Terra imme- 
diately and flipped into sub-space 
much closer to the planet than 
he should have. Prunella was on 
Terra that same night, Xenon 
time. The captain told me on his 
next trip that Pruny had com- 
mandeered both quarantine nurs- 
es at Polar Space Field to work 
on her. It still took the two 
women several hours to finish, 
according to him. She must have 
been covered with the things. Bet 
she looked as though she were 
sprouting fur.” 

“One thing I don’t understand,” 
I told Lee. “You kept referring 
to a ‘treatment’ of some kind for 
the powder puffs. Didn’t Prunella 
know about it? If she did, I don’t 
see why she didn’t take it on 



Xenon. Surely, at the risk of be- 
ing insubordinate, you didn’t deny 
it to her if she had ordered it.” 
“Quite the contrary, Sam. 
Prunella knew all about the 
‘treatment.’ And in spite of your 
suspicions as to our hard hearts, 
many of us offered our services 
after leering in what we hoped 
was a suggestive manner. You 
see, Sam, the mysterious treat- 
ment consisted of nothing more 
than a very close examination of 
every square centimeter of the 
skin with a high-power magnifier 
and using a pair of fine tweezers 
to pull out the puff rootlets. But 
in addition to all of Prunella’s 
other faults and/or virtues, 
Prunella was a prude.” 

We drank a silent toast to pure 
womanhood.

THE MORALIST 



123 





In the Cards 

By ALAN COGAN 

It is one thing to safeguard the future . 
and something else entirely to see someone 
you love cry in terror two years from now! 

Illustrated by EMSH 



T HE FIRST thing I did 
when I bought my Grundy 
Projector was take a trip 
to about two years ahead and see 
what was going to happen to me. 
Everyone was doing it around 
that time; students were taking 
short trips into the future to learn 
whether or not they would pass 
their exams, married couples were* 
looking ahead to see how many 
kids they were going to have, 
businessmen were going into the 
future to size up their prospects. 

I took the trip because I was 
getting married and I couldn’t re- 
sist the temptation of finding out 



how things would work out with 
my fiancee Marge and myself. 
Not that I had any doubts about 
Marge, but the Grundy Projec- 
tors were guaranteed harmless 
and there’s no point in taking 
chances with a serious step like 
marriage. 

Everybody was looking ahead 
then. Within a week after the 
Grundy Projectors were intro- 
duced, you could walk past homes 
every evening and see people 
with those shimmering bird-cages 
around them. Their bodies were 
there, but heaven knows when 
their minds were — months and 




'IN THE CARDS 



125 




often even years ahead of time. 

I knew exactly when to go on 
my first time trip. I even knew 
where: I’d already put a down 
payment on a home in the new 
dome housing area where Marge 
and I would be living after the 
wedding. Knowing where to go 
on a time trip is important. On 
this one, for instance, I hadn’t 
been assigned ?n address yet and 
there were all sorts of changes in 
the place — buildings and streets 
where there had only been empty 
lots and sections marked off by 
string — and I just had to hunt 
until I came to our home. 

You can imagine how much 
more difficult finding my future 
self would be if I hadn’t known 
the exact location. That’s about 
the only major drawback to mak- 
ing time trips and I don’t see how 
it can be overcome. Directories 
would be one answer, but how 
would you go about putting them 
together if your crews can’t ask 
questions or touch filing cards or 
even open future visiphone 
books? 

E ventually, after setting 
the dial around the two-year 
mark, which is about the maxi- 
mum limit on most models, I 
found myself in my future home 
in the dome housing area. I was 
watching myself as I would be 
and Marge as she would be. Only 
I didn’t like what I saw. 



We were fighting and scream- 
ing at each other. You could tell 
at a glance that we hated each 
other. And after only two years! 

I was completely stunned as I 
watched that scene. Future Marge 
looked furious; she had the kind 
of look I never even suspected 
she could get on her face. But I 
think I was more enraged at my 
future self than at her. At the 
time, I was seriously in love with 
Marge — although it seemed evi- 
dent it wasn’t going to last— -and 
I loathed myself for acting that 
way toward her. And after all 
those rash promises I had been 
making, too! 

I was really a tangled mess of 
emotions as I watched our future 
selves battling it out. 

I became conscious of not be- 
ing alone as I watched. It didn’t 
take long to discover that it was 
Marge who had come to join me. 
I should have expected her — 
she must have been just as curi- 
ous about her marriage as I was 
and, like myself, would naturally 
take her Projector to the two- 
year limit. Of course we couldn’t 
hold hands the way we would 
have if our bodies had been there, 
but then we probably wouldn’t 
have held them long. We were 
both pretty embarrassed by what 
we saw. 

The cause of the fight was very 
obscure, and though we saw and 
heard everything perfectly, we 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




still didn’t really understand. 
However, the emotions expressed 
were plain enough. 

“You aren’t going to die, 
Marge,” my future self was yell- 
ing at her. “Try and get that 
through your damned thick stu- 
pid skull!” 

“I am! I am!” she was scream- 
ing back at me. “You know I’m 
going to die. You want to get rid 
of me. Our marriage has been 
one long fight from the start.” 

“Don’t talk such damned rot,” 
my future self hollered back at 
her. “There’s probably a perfectly 
good explanation for it all and 
you’re too ignorant to see it!” 

“The only explanation is that 
I’m going to die,” future Marge 
insisted. She broke down, sobbing 
into an already saturated hand- 
kerchief. 

My future self stamped around 
the room, cursing and furiously 
kicking the furniture. “Why don’t 
you find out for sure? Why don’t 
you go in closer and find out the 
real reason?” 

She sobbed even louder. “I 
daren’t! You do it for me. Go 
find out for yourself and then 
tell me.” 

That seemed to make my fu- 
ture self even madder. “You know 
I wouldn’t touch one of those 
things even to save my life. I 
mean it, too! Besides, if you do 
die, it’ll be your own fault. You’ll 
have believed yourself to death! 



You think you’re going to die 
and now you won’t be happy un- 
til you are dead.” 

Future Marge began to sob 
hysterically and my Marge, who 
had been right beside me, sud- 
denly seemed to grow a little 
more remote. 

Then a strange thing hap- 
pened. My future self stopped 
pacing up and down the room 
and turned to look straight at me 
with the queerest expression on 
his face. That was enough for 
me. I got out of there fast and 
flipped back to the peace and se- 
curity of 2017. 

T CLIMBED out of my Grundy 

Projector, glad to be back in 
the relative calm of my body, al- 
though it still took me a long time 
to get settled down. I felt like 
smashing the Projector there and 
then, and I guess I should have 
done it. 

The problem that had me all 
tied in knots was whether or not 
I should go ahead and marry 
Marge after what I had seen. I 
know it looked as though I was 
going to marry her anyway, but 
in my innocence I figured I could 
beat that. 

I soon realized I was going to 
get nowhere sitting all by myself 
in my room, so I went over to 
Marge’s place. She was waiting 
for me, swinging quietly to and 
fro on the hammock on the dark 



IN THE CARDS 



127 




patio. Normally I would have sat 
right down beside her, but this 
time I just stood back sheepishly 
and waited. 

Neither of us said anything 
for a while and I just watched as 
the hammock floated in the faint 
bluish light from some nearby 
lamps. Marge seemed to shine 
almost angelically as the glow 
caught her dark eyes and her 
softly tanned arms and legs. 

¥ OOULD have whipped my- 
self for treating her the way 
I had seen myself treating her 
in the future. It must have been 
a mistake. There had to be a 
mistake somewhere. I couldn’t 
have made myself do anything 
to hurt her. 

Her voice was husky and 
scared when she spoke. “Do you 
think it’ll happen the way we 
saw it, Gerry?” she asked. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “They 
say that whatever you see always 
turns out to be the thing that 
happens.” 

“Do you think we’ll fight like 
that when — if we’re married?” 

It was on the end of my tongue 
to talk common sense and logic 
to her, but then I realized that 
neither of us wanted to hear any- 
thing like that. We were in love 
and we didn’t want to hear any- 
thing that conflicted with our 
emotions. 

Marge sat up in the hammock 
128 



and made room for me to sit 
down beside her. 

“I just don’t see how it could 
happen to us,” I said.. “I don’t see 
how we could fight like that 
There must have been some mis- 
take. Maybe we looked in on the 
wrong people.” 

Neither of us added anything 
to that. We both knew we weren’t 
going to change so much that we 
couldn’t recognize ourselves two 
years later. 

“Maybe it was some sort of al- 
ternative world we saw,” I sug- 
gested, eagerly clutching at any 
straw, “showing us what could 
happen if we didn’t work hard at 
our marriage. It could have been 
a sort of warning of what could 
happen to some people. But not 
us, of course!” 

Marge’s lonely little hand crept 
into mine for comfort and I began 
to warm up to the subject. 

“Don’t you worry about it,” I 
assured her. “What would we ever 
find to quarrel about?” 

The idea seemed so preposter- 
ous, we both began to laugh. 

“I couldn’t fight with you, Ger- 
ry,” Marge said, snuggling closer. 

“Me, neither,” I said. “Don’t 
worry about what we saw. The 
scientific boys will probably have 
a rational explanation worked out 
for the whole thing. I’ll bet it’s 
happened to lots of people.” 

Somehow, while we were talk- 
ing, we had managed to get very 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




close together in the hammock. 
Marge and I could never talk far 
apart for long. 

“I couldn’t wait for you to come 
over,” Marge said in a small voice. 

“I couldn’t wait to get here,” I 
lied. “I just don’t believe that 
what we saw could possibly hap- 
pen to us. What on Earth would 
wp ever find to fight over?” 

That was the one basic mis- 
take that we, and everyone else, 
made when we discussed the 
Bilbo Grundy Projector. When 
the Projector showed you some- 
thing was going to happen, it 
happened. 

That night, Marge and I made 
plans to get married even sooner 
and the ceremony took place 
four weeks later. 

G RUNDY’S PROJECTOR had 
been a well-kept secret until 
it suddenly burst upon us with a 
carefully planned publicity cam- 
paign. There hadn’t even been a 
hint of experiments in the time- 
travel field until the discovery 
had suddenly been made public 
in the newspapers and on the TV 
screens of the whole world. 

Grundy had discovered a way 
of projecting a person’s view into 
the future and the equipment re- 
quired turned out to be amazingly 
compact, simple and inexpensive. 
The average cost of a Projector 
was fifty-five dollars — well within 
practically anyone’s price range. 



Grundy and his backers had 
lined up a large number of fa- 
mous people beforehand, all of 
whom had tried the Projector 
and were only too willing to tell 
us how great it was. Terrific fun 
— the newest thrill since the first 
radio, or the first airplane, or the 
first space rocket. And absolutely 
harmless, tool 

All you had to do was set a 
dial and get into the cage and 
you could watch yourself an hour 
or a day or up to two years ahead 
of time. If you wanted to see if it 
was going to rain that weekend, 
all you did was climb in and 
take a look. If you wanted to' see 
where you would be going for 
your annual vacation, just press 
a button and you would see your- 
self making the final plans. All 
for fifty-rfive dollars. What with 
all the advertising coming at us 
via every possible medium, 
Grundy sold a million in the 
first five days. 

Because he knew exactly how 
many he was going to sell — just 
by making use of his own inven- 
tion — Grundy was fully prepared 
for the onslaught of customers. 

Everyone talked of nothing but 
the new sensation. You couldn’t 
go anywhere without hearing 
about it. It seemed as if the rest 
of the world had. stopped. 

Before long, there wasn’t a 
thing about the next two years 
that we didn’t know. We all 



IN THE CARDS 



129 




jumped ahead in great leaps and 
found out all kinds of things that 
were due to happen to us and to 
the world. If the things were good, 
we waited happily for them to 
happen. If things didn’t look too 
good, we shrugged it off, like 
Marge and me, and said it couldn’t 
happen to us. 

¥JUT that was the catch. What- 
ever we saw happening did 
take place exactly as we saw it 
— it was inescapable. The first 
instance I saw of this was in the 
accountanting office where I op- 
erated an accounts analyzer. We 
advertised for a new operator to 
assist in my department and lined 
up interviews with thirty-two ap- 
plicants. When the day of the 
interviews arrived, only one ap- 
plicant turned up. He was found 
suitable and got the job. 

The president, Mr. Atkins, was 
pretty het up about the whole 
affair. “Why would thirty-one 
men not present themselves for 
interviews as they had arranged?” 
he kept asking me. “It’s a good 
job, isn’t it, Gerald?” 

I tried to explain to him that 
the Time Projector was probably 
involved in the affair, although I 
couldn’t see how exactly. Mr. At- 
kins was an old man who didn’t 
believe in new gadgets of any 
kind and he wasn’t convinced. 
Finally, however, I managed to 
get him to call some of the appli- 



cants and ask them why they had 
not appeared for their interviews. 

He almost went apoplectic 
when he heard the reasons. Each 
of the thirty-one answered that 
he had flipped ahead to see what 
was going to happen on that par- 
ticular day and each one had seen 
that he wasn’t going to visit Mr. 
Atkins in search of a job, so he 
didn’t go. Some of them even 
told him that they knew they 
were going to get jobs elsewhere 
on a certain date and that they 
were just taking a vacation until 
that day came. 

I had a hard time soothing 
Mr. Atkins that afternoon. He 
wouldn’t stop talking about it. 
Finally, just to satisfy himself, he 
re-interviewed the sole successful 
applicant. As we should have ex- 
pected, the new man answered 
that he had looked ahead to see 
that he was going to get the job 
and had dutifully made his ap- 
pearance. 

Mr. Atkins was flabbergasted 
and he spluttered and fumed for 
minutes on end. Then he looked 
crafty. “What am I going to do 
now?” he asked the new man. 

“You’re going out to get drunk, 
sir,” the new man answered. 

And that’s exactly what Mr. 
Atkins did. 

| RAZY situations like that be- 
^ came commonplace in no 
time. The newspapers were filled

with them every day, though it 
still took us quite a while to un- 
derstand that there was nothing 
we could do to avoid the inevi- 
table. It was all pretty staggering 
and naturally we protested like 
madmen. Naturally it didn’t do 
a bit of good. It was in the cards 
that we would protest without 
results. 

Even when we did get quieted 
down, we were still in a daze be- 
cause of the weird things that 
were happening. For instance, 
there was this fellow on our 
street who suddenly became fa- 
mous for writing a best-selling 
novel. 

For ten years, he had been 
writing without selling a word 
and then suddenly he broke into 
the big time with a best-seller. 
Everyone asked him how he had 
done it and he calmly explained 
that he looked into the future 
and .saw himself with a popular 
novel to his credit. He found out 
what the novel was about and 
then catpe back to his own time 
and wrote it and his success 
worked out exactly as he had seen 
it on his time trip. No one could 
say that he hadn’t written the 
book himself. 

My kid brother Willy was in 
first year rnedjcine when he 
looked ahead and saw that he 
wasn’t going to be present at the 
term-end exams, so he just didn’t 
bother to attend. He stayed in 

IN THE CARDS 



bed that day. He didn’t want to 
be a doctor, anyway — I think he 
only started it for my mother’s 
sake. A lot of people argued with 
him and said if he had only got- 
ten out of bed that morning and 
gone to school, the prediction 
would have been proven false. 

The only answer to that, of 
course, is that Willy just didn’t 
get out of bed that morning, thus 
proving the prediction true. 

We argued for weeks over that 
one. It doesn’t matter now — Willy 
is a ’copter mechanic and crazy 
about the work. After all, he 
didn’t have the slightest difficulty 
getting a job. He simply looked 
ahead to see where he would be 
working and then applied. 

Inevitably, some people found 
out when they were going to die. 
Even when they took steps to 
forestall the grim event, they 
often discovered that their plans 
actually helped them arrive at 
their demise right on the button. 
But most people died of old age 
anyway, what with all the latest 
developments in safety engineer- 
ing and medicine. 

Nevertheless, it meant that fate 
was having its own way as usual, 
with the difference that we knew 
everything beforehand and re-

kinds of changes affected our 
lives. 

For a start, a lot of people au- 
tomatically found their jobs had 
disappeared overnight — weather 
forecasters, news analysts, poll- 
sters, stock-market speculators, 
and all the people connected with 
any form of racing, betting, lot- 
teries or raffles, to name only a 
few. Gambling, respectable or 
otherwise, requires someone to 
win and someone to lose — and 
who’d be willing to lose on a re- 
sult he already knew? 

A few new jobs were created 
by others who looked ahead and 
foresaw such things as earth- 
quakes, fires, floods, volcanic 
eruptions and violent storms. 
They set up special teams for 
handling these disasters, evacu- 
ating people and removing valu- 
able property beforehand. 

This explained why, as we 
looked ahead, we saw fewer and 
fewer deaths occurring from these 
tragedies. The growing efficiency 
of the rescue services worked 
wonders — which were part of the 
future, as you’d expect, not suc- 
cessful attempts to change it — 
although there were always a 
small number of deaths, mainly 
the kind of people who never 
used to pay any attention to the 
news, didn’t look at road signs, 
and the like. 

Some of them belonged to the 
crowd who opposed Bilbo Grun-

dy’s fabulous invention. They 
were strictly a minority but, as is 
usually the case, they were a 
pretty noisy and outspoken 
bunch. They were a mixed lot, 
too, made up of people who had 
foreseen their deaths or personal 
disaster, those who had lost their 
jobs through the invention, a 
number of cranks who habitually 
were against everything, plus a 
few, like myself, who just didn’t 
feel easy about the Projector. 

I couldn’t see that time travel 
was evil or sinful the way some 
of them described it and I never 
attended any of their protest 
meetings, but I did sympathize 
with them to a certain extent. 
Everyone called them the ‘Die- 
hards’ and the stock remark was 
that they should look into the 
future to see if their movement 
was going to be a success before 
they got too involved in it. 

That drove them wild. 

1%/f ARGE spent a lot of time 
with her Projector. The de- 
vice was very popular with wom- 
en, mainly, I guess, because it was 
the absolutely perfect fortune- 
telling device and it was much 
more fun than either video or 
visiphone conversations. 

I put my own Grundy Projec- 
tor away in the basement shortly 
after I got married and I never 
used it any more. To my way of 
thinking, it made life pretty dull. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




I had just been married and I 
was also starting to get ahead 
at my job — Mr. Atkins had put 
me in charge of a whole depart- 
ment full of accounts analyzers. 
I went around with all sorts of 
wild plans and dreams of a rosy 
future for us. I hoped someday 
to form my own company and I 
was also interested in finding a 
better place to live. The dome 
housing development was only 
temporary as far as I was con- 
cerned and I wanted something 
bigger for when we could afford 
a family. 

I suppose we all have those 
dreams of success when we’re 
young, and though most of us 
have fairly predictable futures, 
I still can’t help thinking that it’s 
those wild dreams and schemes 
that keep us slugging away and 
add a little zest to life. Anyway, 
I soon found that Marge was 
knocking all the zest out of my 
life because she knew the future 
for both of us and she kept telling 
me about it. 

It took me a few weeks to fi- 
nally persuade her that I’d rather 
not know what was going to hap- 
pen. But it was too late then, be- 
cause she’d told me everything 
that was important. 

For instance, I knew I was go- 
ing to be living in the dome 
house for another two years and 
probably more. I knew I was still 
going to be working for Mr. At- 



kins and I knew just how much 
money I was going to have in the 
bank at the end of two years. I 
even knew that my paunch would 
get bigger and my hair would 
start falling out 

Life got to be just a matter of 
sitting around waiting for the ex- 
pected to happen. 

I TRIED hard to break Marge 
of the time projection habit, 
but it was useless. She was as ad- 
dicted as everyone else and the 
Grundy Projector looked as 
though it was going to be here for 
good and no one was going to 
stop it. 

After all, who could prevent an 
expectant mother from jumping 
ahead a year or so to find out 
whether she is going to have a 
boy or girl? I know the doctors 
can tell with one hundred per 
cent accuracy in the second 
month, but the parents-to-be still 
want to find out if Junior will 
look like Mom or Dad. 

Or who could prevent a young 
boy and girl from finding out 
whom they were going to marry? 
New methods of courting ap- 
peared — if you could call it 
courting. A boy would merely 
look ahead and find out who the 
lucky girl was going to be and 
then call on her. She was usually 
sitting at the front door waiting 
for him, too. I kind of liked the 
old-fashioned way, when Marge

and I met by chance one day 
and then spent months getting 
to know each other. 

Of course it was impossible to 
avoid knowing future news 
whether you wanted to hear it 
or not. The newspapers, in trying 
to beat each other to scoops, 
could only find good headline 
material among the Diehards; 
the rest of us all knew what 
would happen to us. Most of the 
papers carried two separate sec- 
tions — one for future events and 
the other for present “news.” 

We still had crime with us. 
The crooks who knew they Were 
going to jail always went there 
at the appointed time, regardless 
of their elaborate precautions and 
so-called foolproof systems. Oth- 
ers who knew they were going 
to stay free for a couple of years 
at least led fabulously successful 
lives of crimes, made more daring 
by the fact that they knew they 
were temporarily safe from the 
law. The police, on the other 
hand, never bothered to chase 
these characters, knowing in ad- 
vance that they weren’t going to 
catch them anyway. 

This naturally set the Diehards 
to hollering. For a time, they 
talked of forming vigilante groups 
to do their own policing, but no- 
body worried about this. It was 
in the cards, you see, that they 
weren’t going to do it. 

The final blow to the Diehards 

134 



came during the Federal Elec- 
tions of 2017, when the Neo-Re- 
publicans just got up and walked 
out of office and the United 
North -South Democrats walked 
in without a single election speech 
being made. I know a few votes 
were cast, but everyone knew 
what the results would be long 
before it happened. 

The part that annoyed the Die- 
hards so much was that it was 
their handful of votes that de- 
cided the results. 

OWARD the end of the first 
two years, Marge and I began 
to have our first samples of that 
bitter quarrel we had both wit- 
nessed on our first time trip. I 
had almost forgotten about what 
I had seen, but soon I saw how 
I was going to be taking part in 
such quarrels quite frequently. 

Marge just wouldn’t stop mak- 
ing those time trips and it seemed 
to me she spent hours every day 
in her Projector. There was some- 
thing in the future that worried 
her and, naturally that worried 
me, too. I was almost tempted to 
get my own Projector out of the 
basement and find out for myself. 
Marge was beginning to look sick 
and pale all the time. She got 
much thinner and weaker and I 
knew she cried a lot when I 
wasn’t around. 

I tried my best to find the 
cause of the trouble, but I got 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





nowhere. Trying to cheer her up 
with little surprises was a waste 
of time. It’s no fun trying to sur- 
prise anyone who knows better 
than yourself what the surprise 
is going to be. 

Finally, when out of despera- 
tion I had almost decided to take 
my first time trip in nearly two 
years, I came home from the of- 
fice to find Marge sobbing hys- 
terically beside the Projector. 

“We’re going to die, Gerry!” 
she said, when I managed to get 
,her fairly coherent. “I’ve been 
looking ahead for months now 
and I just don’t see us anywhere 
in the future!” 

So there it was. I didn’t know 
what to do or say. I was scared 
and mad and sorry for Marge for 
keeping such a secret bottled up 
inside herself for so long. 

The first thing I said was, 
“There must be a mistake — ” until 
I remembered that there were 
never any mistakes with Grundy 
Projectors. 

TVTEVERTHELESS, I still tried 
-L ’ to find a way out of the situ- 
ation. “Maybe you couldn’t find 
us because we moved,” I said 
quickly. “Maybe I got another 
job and left town or was trans- 
ferred to the Boston office. Mr. 
Atkins has mentioned it a couple 
of times.” 

“I looked,” Marge said miser- 
ably. “I looked everywhere and I 



just couldn’t see us anywhere.” 
“But how do you know we’re 
going to die?” I argued. “Did you 
see it happen?” 

She shook her head. “I didn’t 
dare look that close. I got it 
pinned down to somewhere in the 
next month and I didn’t dare look 
any closer, afraid I might have 
to see something horrible. All I 
know is we just won’t be around 
sometime after the next four or 
five weeks.” 

“Has anyone mentioned any- 
thing to you about our death?” I 
asked. It was considered improper 
to even hint at another person’s 
death just in case that person 
hadn’t found out. Still, you know 
how tactless some people can be. 

Marge just shook her head and 
went right on sobbing. 

“Listen,” I said, “I’ll bet you’re 
getting all worked up for noth- 
ing. Anything — absolutely any- 
thing — could happen in the 
next few weeks. There’s probably 
a perfectly simple explanation 
for the whole thing.” 

I guess I wasn’t very convinc- 
ing because Marge just stared 
dumbly at me, tears spilling out 
of her eyes. “Gerry, would — 
would you go and look? If it’s 
something harmless, you can 
come right back and tell me. If 
it’s something awful, I won’t ask 
about it.” 

“No,” I said. “That would be 
just the same as telling you what’s 



IN THE CARDS 



135 




going to happen. Besides, I don’t 
want to know.” 

We just sat around the house 
for the rest of that evening. After 
Marge had gone to bed, I went 
down to the basement and 
smashed both our Bilbo Grundy 
Time Projectors into little pieces. 
I’d seen the hopelessness and de- 
spair in people who had learned 
just how and when they would 
die. Smashing the things wouldn’t 
change the future — I realized 
that — but I didn’t want Marge 
obeying the impulse to find out. 
Or myself, for that matter. 

S HORTLY after that, the quar- 
reling started in earnest. 
Marge wouldn’t let up on the 
business of dying, and as well as 
being scared, I was also sick of 
hearing about our short and ques- 
tionable future. Marge was furi- 
ous with me for destroying her 
Projector and blamed me con- 
stantly for making her suffer by 
preventing her from looking into 
the future. 

“Now we won’t know what’s 
going to happen until it’s too 
late!” she shrieked at me. 

“That’s right!” I yelled back. 
“And that’s just the way I want 
it! What’s the use of knowing and 
worrying in advance if there’s no 
way of doing anything about it?” 
Then, one night, we had the 
identical fight that we had 
watched two years earlier, on our 

136 



first time trip. Marge, as usual, 
was crying hysterically about not 
having long to live and I was 
shouting at her about wishing 
herself into the grave. She seemed 
to have forgotten that I was go- 
ing to go, too, and had taken all 
the suffering on her own shoul- 
ders. 

When I was hollering and 
stamping about the room, I had 
a funny, eerie feeling as I sud- 
denly remembered that my 
younger unmarried self had 
watched — or was watching — 
the same scene. 

I just stopped doing anything 
for a moment and stared around 
the room. Naturally I saw noth- 
ing, because there was nothing to 
see, and I remembered how 
quickly my younger self had fled 
when I had looked up like that 
Ashamed, I tried to soothe Marge, 
but she was too far gone to be 
comforted. 

I was glad to get out of the 
house every day and spend a 
few hours at the office. I must ad- 
mit that I was scared to be with 
Marge because it looked as 
though we were going to go to- 
gether and I felt safer away from 
her. I know it’s nothing to be 
proud of, but it helped ease the 
tension, for Marge as well as my- 
self. 

One day, Mr. Atkins stopped 
in at my office and sat down to 
talk. There was nothing unusual 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





about this; he often visited me 
for a chat, even though he wasn’t 
so friendly with the other em- 
ployees. 

We talked for a while about 
the usual things, department busi- 
ness and some of the staff mem- 
bers. 

Then Mr. Atkins turned the 



conversation away from business 
matters. “Do you have one of 
those newfangled Time Projec- 
tor things, Gerald?” he asked. Mr. 
Atkins was getting on in years 
and called everything introduced 
in the last thirty years “newfan- 
gled.” 

“No,” I said. “I did have one,

but I stopped using it soon after 
I got it.” 

“Didn’t you like it?” 

I shrugged. “It wasn’t that. I 
just preferred to find out for my- 
self what would happen to me.” 
I didn’t want to tell him the true 
story or my other troubles. 

Mr. Atkins sat back in his chair 
and sighed. “Ah, yes. I don’t sup- 
pose you remember too much 
about the old days, not after the 
last two years we’ve been through. 
People had problems in those 
days and they used to have to 
solve them for themselves. Peo- 
ple don’t have to make decisions 
any more, you know. Do you 
think you could still make a de- 
cision, Gerald?” 

T GOT a little excited and found 
it difficult to stop fidgeting and 
stay quietly seated. I began to 
suspect that he was leading up to 
something important. It could 
have been the transfer to another 
branch or an out-of-town assign- 
ment which would explain our 
disappearance in the future. 

“I still try to make plans and 
direct my own future whenever 
I can,” I stalled. 

“It’s difficult, I know,” Mr. At- 
kins went on, “especially when 
all the news is about something 
that’s going to happen a day or 
a week or a year from now. It’s 
not so bad for an old man like 
me, but it must be tough on you 

138 



young fellows. Too bad this Bilbo 
— uh— ” 

“Grundy,” I said. “Bilbo Grun- 
dy.” Mr. Atkins knew the name 
as well as I did, but it was one of 
his little tricks to pretend he was 
getting old and forgetful, al- 
though he really wasn’t. It used 
to be a good business tactic be- 
fore the Grundy Projector came 
out. It wasn’t any more — not with 
people being able to see outcomes 
of dealings — but he couldn’t get 
rid of the habit. 

“It’s too. bad he had to invent 
that fool time gadget,” he went 
on. “I suppose your wife uses it 
all the time. They seem to be 
very popular with women.” 

“Marge gave it up a short time 
ago,” I lied. “She got bored with 
it.” 

Mr. Atkins nodded thought- 
fully. “Wouldn’t it be nice to live 
in an age again when none of us 
knew what was going to happen? 
When life had lots of surprises — 
both good and bad? When you 
could get up in the morning and 
not be sure what was going to 
happen before night? Would you 
like that, Gerald?” 

I didn’t know what to say. He 
was off on that wandering-mind 
routine and I didn’t know for 
sure whether he was really ram- 
bling or not. 

“I think I’d like it, Mr. Atkins,” 
I said. “As long as everyone else 
was in the same boat.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“ Would you like it?” He was 
suddenly looking at me with the 
shrewd, out-of-the-corner-of-the- 
eye expression he had when he 
was handling some wealthy cli- 
ent’s intricate income tax prob- 
lems. 

“I mean it,” I told him. “I’m 
tired of living among people who 
know my business two years 
ahead of time.” 

“I can get you to a world like 
that,” he said quietly. 

I didn’t say anything in reply. 
Who could? 

“I have some friends,” he went 
on, “who make a practice of help- 
ing people like yourself to better 
things.” 

“What do you mean by ‘better 
things’?” I asked warily. 

“I’m talking about time travel, 
Gerald. The real thing — not the 
Bilbo Grundy toy, but real phy- 
sical time travel. These friends 
have gone a lot further than 
Grundy did with his invention 
and they perform the service of 
transporting people to a better 
age.” 

“You mean the future?” 

“The past!” said Mr. Atkins. 
“The chances are the future will 
be even worse. I’m talking about 
the middle of the last century, 
around the nineteen - fifties or 
thereabouts.” 

I began to laugh. “The nine- 
teen-fifties! What would I do to 
earn a living in those days?” 



TIE GAVE me a thin smile. “I 
guess that would be your 
first unsolved problem. After all, 
you said you wanted problems 
and the chance to make plans 
and try to make them/eome true.” 

“But why pick me?” I wanted 
to know. 

“I like you, Gerald,” he said. 
“I would like to see you have a 
decent chance. And don’t flatter 
yourself — you wouldn’t be the 
first one to go. You’d be in good 
company.” 

I just sat staring vacantly at 
him. 

“I guess you could say this is 
your first big decision in two 
years,” he added. “There’s no 
hurry. You can think it over for 
a while.” 

I asked questions — lots of them 
— but I didn’t get too many an- 
swers. Mr. Atkins explained that 
naturally the affair was hush- 
hush. After the way the Grundy 
Projector had been thrust so ir- 
responsibly upon us, no one want- 
ed any further complications. But 
there were some answers I could 
piece together both from what I 
already knew and the hints he 
dropped. 

I’d been in on conferences and 
listened to Mr. Atkins try to fig- 
ure out ways of expanding, build- 
ing up our business. Each time, 
he’d been stymied by the Grundy 
Projector. If he’d bull some idea 
through, his competitors would

139 




see exactly how it worked out. If 
he didn’t, they’d know that, too. 
And I had heard him rant when 
the accountants — using the 
Grundy Projectors, of course — 
would make up their inventory, 
sales, profit-and-loss and tax state- 
ments two years or more in ad- 
vance. 



That was actually what galled 
him. Mr. Atkins was used to mak- 
ing plans, calculating risks and 
gains, taking his chances. With 
the Grundy Projectors in exis- 
tence, nobody could do that any 
more. I gathered from what he 
told me that there was a syndi- 
cate of men like himself backing

the inventor of a genuine time 
machine. They didn’t condemn 
the Grundy invention on any 
moral or religious or even selfish 
grounds. They just resented very 
bitterly the same thing that an- 
noyed me — the sense of repeti- 
tion. 

As Mr. Atkins put it, “It’s no 



different than reading a story and 
then having to relive the whole 
thing, anticipating each action and 
bit of dialogue. And that’s pre- 
cisely what this is. Only it’s our 
lives, not fiction. We didn’t like 
it, Gerald. We didn’t like it at 
all! But we did something about 
the problem instead of merely 
complaining.” 

Let me say right now that I 
thought the solution they came 
up with was nonsensical and I 
kept searching, all the time we 
talked, for ways of politely turn- 
ing down the offer. Escaping to 
to the past was a ridiculous an- 
swer. But it was just the kind of 
notion that would appeal to an 
old-fashioned character like Mr. 
Atkins. 

I didn’t tell him so, of course. 
I thanked him for his considera- 
tion and shook hands and felt 
relieved when he finally left. 

MIND was made up by 
then. I’d back out, quit if 
I had to, rather than take refuge 
in the past to evade the future. 

It wasn’t until I got out of the 
office that I realized there was 
no big decision to make; it was 
already made for me. Either I 
was going to die or I was going 
into the past — and I wasn’t go- 
ing to die if I could help it. But 
neither did I intend going into 
the past if I could really help

When Marge realized that I 
wasn’t merely trying to take her 
mind off the fatal day, she 
pounced on me and hugged me as 
though I myself had invented the 
time machine just to save her 
life! 

“It’s wonderful, darling!” she 
cried. “You were right all along! 
Oh, how can you forgive me for 
making things so unbearable for 
you?” 

“About this idea of going into 
the past — ” I said. 

“What’s the difference when we 
go to,” she cut in, “as long as we 
don’t have to die?” 

“But I figured on telling Mr. 
Atkins at the last minute that all 
I want is a transfer — ” 

“What’s the sense of guessing?” 
she asked excitedly. “All we have 
to do is bprrow a couple of Pro- 
jectors and see!” 

I began to feel myself being 
squeezed into a one-way trap. I 
put my foot down — but where it 
landed was in a Grundy Projector 
from the people next door- — and 
where it figuratively emerged was 
eleven days later, when I couldn’t 
shut my non-physical eyes to the 
way the whole situation would 
turn out. 

Marge and I, with half a 
dozen others, were getting into a 
helicar. I followed them out to a 
house in the country. We handed 
in all the money we had saved 
and in return were given old- 



style clothes, ancient - looking 
money and a small amount of 
luggage. Then we all stepped into 
what looked like an oversized 
version of a Grundy Projector 
and vanished. 

Fight? Argue? Scheme? 

I didn’t have a chance. 

TT WAS 1956 when we arrived 

in old New York. We were 
met by others who had pioneered 
the way before us and they looked 
after our group until we lgprned 
the ropes. 

There was nothing easy about 
getting used to the era. I wished 
often that I could get back to my 
own time, Grundy Projector or 
no Grundy Projector. Still, Marge 
didn’t complain; she was prepared 
to endure anything just because 
she thought her life had been 
saved. Occasionally! bothered by 
my blunders in adjusting to this 
past century, I’d start to reason 
with her, explain that her life 
hadn’t been in danger at all. But 
then, luckily, I would realize that 
convincing her would leave an 
angry, dissatisfied wife on my 
hands and I always managed to 
stop in time. 

I got a job working as a night 
janitor in a bank and studied ac-

was able to get a steady job.

the rest lost weight, occasionally 
to the point of emaciation. But 
that merely proves they wavered 
in their knowledge of why they 
felt hungry. The ones who died 
were just not trying. 

Eating is a habit (compulsive

Most children seem to be “poor”

they feel hungry and so don’t

Not-breathing used to be a

only half-knowing why we

According to the textbooks, we 
breathe so that we can bring oxy- 
gen to the blood cells and remove 
waste products. Superstition, ob- 
viously. When we breathe, the 
alleged waste products removed 
are displaced oxygen molecules, 
shoved along by newcomers; two 
things can’t occupy the same 
space at the same time.

found in childhood: we are 

spanked at birth for not breath- 
ing. 

There’s no point wasting time 
discussing sleep — it’s a heritage 
from our primitive ancestors, who 
had nothing else to do at night — 
or day, if they were nocturnal. 



Breaking any rituals as en- 
trenched as these always creates 
a sense of impending doom. But 
it can be done. That is the thing 
to keep in mind. 

There are so many ways in 
which the formula can be used 
that the real question is where to 
start. 

Spaceships — we could dis- 
pense with food storerooms, gal- 
leys, air recirculation, sanitation, 
heat control, gravity, bunks — 
everything but hull and motive 
power. 

War — maybe the enemy won’t 
buy the formula, but our knowing 
why fission, fusion and bacteria 
warfare kill would make them 
non-lethal. 

Disease — they could all be 
laughed out of existence in a mat- 
ter of minutes. 

Immortality — right at our 
fingertips. 

Overpopulation — one genera- 
tion to bring under control. 

Poverty — who, knowing why 
he felt poor, would be poor? 

Economics — if we know why 
we want to make and buy things, 
we don’t have to. 

The last item bothered me, 
I admit: idle people are bored 
people. But would they be, if 
they knew why they felt bored? 

Lord, what a discovery! But 
hoW is it that I know why I feel 
elated and still am elated?
