Illustrated by Robin Jacques 

The celebrated master of science fiction 
and fantasy now mesmerizes readers with a 
tale of a magic puzzle found in an abandoned 
house. Each of four boys who try to understand 
its strange powers is caught in an eerie spell that 
carries him backward in time to a long-ago and 
far-away adventure. Each confronts a dragon of 
historical legend that relates to his ancestral 
heritage: African, Chinese, Scandinavian, 
Welsh. A brilliant mosaic of cultural lore.

Aside from naming some of our more celebrated contributors such as Ray 
Bradbury, Paul Ehrlich, Jacques Cousteau and Paolo Soleri, and mention- 
ing a few interesting ideas like solar energy, organic burial, Wankel engines 
and cryogenic sperm banks, there is very little that space permits us to say 
about the environmental struggle - except we’re in it up to our gas masks.

D irector magno ves- 

TEVAAL was glad that the 
space shuttle was not equipped to 
enter the planet Roget’s at- 
mosphere at the customary 
maximum velocity. The slower, 
powered descent, gave him ample 
opportunity to study the terrain he 
was approaching. His powerful 
lenses and the facility offered by the 
shuttle’s navigation dome afforded 
him a unique view of the sector of 
the planet adjacent to the 
spaceport. His interest had been 
kindled by the s(>acegram he had 
received, hinting at great trouble. 
Vestevaal was a firm believer in 
making the maximum use of infor- 
mation when attempting to solve a 
problem. 

Below him now lay Anharitte, 
not the largest but certainly the 
most influential city on Roget. He 
could see it all with crystal clarity. 
To the west spread the sea, one of 
the great oceans dividing the plan- 
etary continents. To the north and 
east the landmass was largely 
sandy, fertile plains comprising the 
provinces of TEmpte, Magda, pro- 
vincial Anharitte and the broad 
lands of T Ampere. Beneath the 
city proper, the teautiful bow of the 
AprUlo river cut a wide channel 
throu^ the sandbanks to the sea. 
The city of Anharitte was based 



on natural geological features. The 
three broad hills must have been is- 
lands in a Time when the oceans had 
been even wider than the limits de- 
cided by their present disposition. 
The hills formed a rough triangle 
rising above the stubborn plains, 
forcing the waters of the tributary 
of Daizan and several small canals 
to pass between their green and 
granite flanks. The first hill was 
Anharitte itself, the main com- 
mercial and administrative center 
of the region. Even from a height 
the director could see the outlines 
of the three great castles of Di 
Guaard, Di Rode and Di Irons. 
Farther east along the banks of the 
Aprillo rose the second 'hill, 
T Ampere, no longer a citadel, yet 
holding the major wealth of a vast 
province under more than adequate 
control. 

Situated roughly between the 
other hills, yet displaced north, was 
the third hill. It was smaller than its 
brethren and even from a height ap- 
peared more sinister with the pre- 
dominating grays and browns of the 
underlying rocks. This was Magda, 
key to a minor province and pos- 
sessing the most formidable fortress 
of all. It was with Magda, with its 
paucity of approach roads and its 
craggy, inhospitable outlines, that 
the director was most concerned. 
These lands were the realm of the 
man known as the Imaiz, who, if 



6 



IF 




the rq>orts were substantiated, 
posed a considerable threat not 
only to the composite city of An- 
haritte, but also to the spaceport 
and the rich trade therefrom. 

At the spaceport there were no 
formalities. All the details such as 
the ship’s identity and charter, the 
manifest and the passenger list, had 
long since been transmitted to the 
terminal by the shipboard data 
links and the relevant cargo equip- 
ment was already standing at the 
edge of the landing bowl. As the 
shuttle completed touchdown pro- 
cedure, Director Vestevaal strode 
straight to the small cushion-craft 
awaiting him. Within minutes he 
was clear of the limits of the 
spaceport. 

T he cushion-craft bore him 
along the wide sandy road of 
the Via Arena, the main trade road 
leading into Anharitte. In front of 
him, green and mellow in the sun, 
stood the broad bulk of Firsthill, 
bearing on its right-hand shoulder 
the dominating battlements of the 
Castle Di Guaard frowning down 
on the reaches of the great Aprillo 
river. Slightly farther away and to 
the left, the darker shades of 
Thirdhill — the lands of Magda — 
rose in a dark and rather sinister 
contrast. It was not possible for 
Vestevaal to see the castle of 
Magda from his present location. 



but somewhere on those strange, 
broken heights was the fortress 
home of the Imaiz. the wizard of 
Anharitte, whose activities had 
fetched Magno Vestevaal unwill- 
ingly halfway across tlM universe^. 

Some three and a half kilometers 
along the Via Arena he came to the 
Black Rock. This marked the limit 
for the free use of cushion-craft. 
From this point on he had to — by 
city ordinance — engage some stave- 
bearers whose poles would guide 
the craft safely through the popu- 
lated streets. Because the vehicle 
had no positive contact with the 
roadway it was subject to deflection 
by winds and gradients. Within the 
city limits the stave-bearers would 
run alongside, driving their staves 
occasionally into the soft undersand 
and forcing the fenders of the craft 
to run along the iron-tipped poles, 
thus defining and correcting the 
course of the floating vehicle. 
Progress was necessarily slow and 
laborious, but since power-driven 
wheeled vehicles were not allowed 
on the three hills, the visitor had no 
choice but to suffer it or to walk. 

Just past the Arena a ragged run- 
ner, sent by the Company’s agent, 
Tito Ren, met them and trotted 
ahead to guide them up the slopes 
of the Trade Road and through the 
crowded ways to the food market of 
Firsthill where Ren had an office. 
The agent paid the men off quickly. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



7 




ordered house servants to collect 
the luggage and ushered the di- 
rector into the welcome coolness of 
the office chambers. 

Whfie he was watdi^for Vesfe- 
va,^ to complete his ablutions Tito 
Ren watched continually out of the 
window that overlooked the food 
market, as if h^ /were waiting for 
someone to appear. A half-hour 
later the director was refreshed and 
ready. He laid the spacegram 
purposefully on the table. 

“Well, Tito, you’ve fetched me a 
long way at a most inopportune 
time. Whatever you have to say had 
better be good.’’ 

Ren turned away from his van- 
tage point at the window. 

“It will be,’’ he said. “But the 
best way I can approach the intrica- 
cies of the situation is to start by 
showing you something. Unfortu- 
nately the time is yet a little early. 
Please take some wine.’’ 

“If this is a fool’s errand — ’’ 
Vestevaal said ominously. He did 
not bother to complete the sentence. 
He knew Ren as one of the most 
shrewd and efficient agents in the 
Company, and the long-standing 
association between the two men 
had bred a mutual trust and re- 
spect. Grumbling into his beard, 
Vestevaal accepted wine and came 
and stood by the window looking 
out at the busy, colorful market. 

“How long have we to wait for 



this great happening?” he asked. 

Ren shrugged. “She would nor- 
mally be here by now. But I suspect 
the coming of your cushion-craft 
wiS have sturred tlnngs up a bit. The 
<Hie thing you can rely pn in An- 
haritte is that every third man is a 

spy” 

“And every third woman?” asked 
Vestevaal mischievously. 

Ren shook his head. “The women 
count for almost nothing in An- 
haritte. Except one — and that’s the 
one we’re waiting for.” 

F inally becoming bored 
with the scene, the director 
turned away and began to explore 
the chambers. Ren remained obsti- 
nately at the window. Then a cry 
from the agent brought Vestevaal 
hastily back to follow Ren’s indi- 
cating finger. 

“Here’s what I was waiting to 
show you. Director. Do you see that 
girl down there?” 

“The tall ono in the orange 
dress?” 

“That’s Zinder — a bondslave of 
the Castle Magda on Thirdhill. She 
comes to the market daily, shop- 
ping for the Imaiz.” 

“For a bondslave she’s re- 
markably well dressed.” 

“For a bondslave she’s re- 
markable in too many ways.” Ren 
turned back into the room to face 
Vestevaal. “Notice how the traders 



8 



IF 




treat her. Almost with deference. 
9ie may be a slave, but there’s 
none who would dare molest her. 
There’s not a beggar or a bondsman 
on the three hills who wouldn’t 
come to her defense — even, at the 
risk of his life.” 

Magno Vestevaal scowled. “Re- 
markable. It shows a degree of 
social unity I’d not have expected in 
such a feudal setup.” 

“Great currents are at work 
here,” said Ren. “But they run 
deep. To measure their pulse needs 
a careful finger. It wouldn’t be 
naive to say that Zinder somehow 
represents what the Ahhfi as a race 
hope to become.” 

“A bondslave?” The director was 
perplexed. 

“Yes, but what a bondslave! 
Study her carefully. Look at every 
detail about her — polished to 
perfection. Notice the dignity in the 
way she walks. That poise comes 
from confidence. And the confi- 
dence comes from thorough 
training and education.” 

“I don’t see why you’re making 
so much of her,” said Vestevaal 
with a trace of irritation. “Many 
people groom their pets. I assume a 
slave girl in Anharitte is a legiti- 
mate part of a man’s harem.” 

“A slavemaster’s control is ab- 
solute, including control of life and 
death,” confirmed Ren. “But I 
don’t think you quite understood 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



me. I said training and education.” 
“But you don’t educate slaves — 
not beyond what’s necessary for 
them to perform their duties,” ob- 
jected the director. 

“Then one neeib to speculate on 
just what Zinder’s duties are. We 
haven’t yet found the full measure 
of her abilities. She’s prpHcient in 
all thirteen space languages, is ap- 
parently gifted in music and -arts 
and has a scientific knowledge that 
would probably qualify her for two 
or three degrees at a Terran uni- 
versity.” - 

“Fantastic,” said Magno Veste- 
vaal, when the implications had 
sunk home. He moved the curtain 
to gain a further look at the tall 
dark Ahhn girl who moved like a 
queen around the market. “How do 
you know so much about her, 
Tito?” 

“I paid good Company money to 
the Society of -Pointed Tails to have 
her investigated. They devised 
many tests of her knowledge and 
aptitude by way of commerce and 
conversation. They were more than 
impressed by what they found.” 
“How much confidence do you 
have in the society’s report?” 

“Every confidence. In Anharitte, 
a society must keep perfect faith 
with its patron.'A society can refuse 
to accept any assignment — and fre- 
quently does to 'avoid conflict of 
interests — but once an assignment 

9 




is accepted its terms and conditions 
become binding on its members 
even to the point of death. That’s 
clan law, and its enforcement is 
savage.” 

“Accepting that for the moment, 
perhaps you’d explain why you felt 
it n^ssary to spend Company 
money investigating a slave girl?” 

Ren cleared his throat. “An- 
haritte is a freeport not only for 
Roget but for all ship trade space- 
ward into the Hub. As a space- 
commerce base it is priceless. The 
vast fortunes of the space combines 
and the merchant worlds have been 
possible very largely because of the 
facility offered by Anharitte as a 
Freetrade exchange. Make no mis- 
take, Director, our own Company 
could not exist without commercial 
access to Anharitte.” 

“I’m more aware of the fact than 
you arc,” said Vestevaal, “or I 
would not be here nOw. What 
disturbs me is your implication that 
our access to Anharitte is at risk.” 

“I see it this way,” said Ren. 
“Anharitte is unique in having 
maintained its long-term social sta- 
bility Mn spite of having been ex- 
posed to space commerce. There 
have been a few other freeports, but 
all have succumbed to the disadvan- 
tage of their planetary govern- 
ments, requiring a disproportionate 
share of the value of the merchan- 
dise being shuttled through their 



territory. Anharitte is: different — 
the tolls and levies remain nominal 
because they’re shared only by the 
five aristocratic Houses: those of 
the Lords Di Irons, Di Rode, Di 
Guaard and by the Lady 
T Ampere — and by the House of 
Magda. The influence of these few 
has maintained a rigid social struc- 
ture — albeit one with a slave base — 
which has given the necessary sta- 
bility to Anharitte.” 

“True,” said Vestevaal. “And it 
pays the lords very handsomely to 
maintain things just as they are. So 
I don’t see what the problem is.” 
“The Imaiz of Magda is rocking 
the boat,” said Reh. 

“What makes you think that?” 
“Director — have you any idea 
what happens to a slave base cul- 
ture when somebody starts edu- 
cating slaves to Terran graduate 
standard?” 

“You’ve made your point,” said 
Vestevaal heavily. “Your culture 
goes unstable. Tt becomes contami- 
nated with ideas like democracy, 
civil liberty and other corrosive no- 
tions. And finally it disintegrates.” 
“And from the ruins somebody 
builds a so-called brave new 
order — which is inherently more 
expensive for freetraders.” 

“Which is inherently ruinous for 
freetraders,” corrected Magno Ves- 
tevaal. “You were perfectly right to 
call me in, Tito, lliis could be the 



10 



IF 




biggest threat to trade since the dis- 
solution of the Omanite empire. 
And you’re perfectly sure that the 
House of Magda is responsible?^’ 
“There’s no doubt of it. It’s 
entirely the work of the Imaiz.” 
“How is the Imaiz different from 
the other lords of Anharitte?” 

“I think the clue lies in the word 
Imaiz itself. This translates 
variously as wizard, wise man or 
madman, depending on which 
Ahha dialect you speak. The sug- 
gestion is that the Imaiz is accorded 
the full rights of nobility because 
his magic is too potent to be 
ignored. The House of Magda has a 
long history of congenital insanity 
among its occupants — a not 
surprising situation when you con- 
sider the close in-breeding that used 
to take place in aristocratic houses 
in order to keep the right of succes- 
sion within a very narrow group. 

“The persistent mental aberra- 
tions of the rulers of Magda, 
usually a form of extreme megalo- 
mania, have given rise to many 
long-standing superstitions about 
the master of the fortress of 
Thirdhill. One of these is that the 
Imaiz has the ability to cast spells 
and control the future. History 
seems to show that few of Magda’s 
occupants were very proficient in 
the black arts, for all the cruel and 
ingenious black rites they devised. 
But the present Imaiz appears to be

a difTerent proposition altogether.” 

“You’re surely not suggesting 
that he actually is proHcient in the 
black arts?” 

“No. And neither is he mad. I’ve 
a diflerent and more dangerous pic- 
ture of the current Imaiz, Dion- 
daizan. All the evidence points to 
the fact that he’s cunning, ruthless, 
academic — and probably of Terran 
origin.” 

“The devil!” said Vestevaal. “I 
thought that outworlders weren’t 
permitted to hold land titles on 
Roget.” 

“They aren’t. There’s some sort 
of subterfuge at work here. But the 
fact that he’s succeeded in be- 
coming a holder is a measure of the 
man we’re up against.” 

II 

WHAT sort of evidence 
do you base your con- 
jecture that he’s a Terran,” asked 
Vestevaal. “You’ve surely not been 
able to study the man himself?” 

“No. We’ve had to content our- 
selves with observing Zinder. She’s 
genuine Ahhn stock — but there’s no 
academy on Roget that could give 
her the type of education she 
possesses.” 

“But that still leaves the possi- 
bility of the Imaiz being from one 
of the other prime worlds.” 

“True,” admitted Ren. “But the 



Society of Pointed Tails is 
thorough in investigating such mat- 
ters. During their inquires they un- 
covered a most significant fact. 
When calculating, Zinder works in 
decimals to the base ten — then 
converts the answers to the galactic 
duodecimal system.” 

“That’s nothing special,” said 
Magno Vestevaal. “I do the same 
myself.” 

“My point entirely. Director. 
Your primary education was on 
Terra and you can’t get out of the 
habit. Whoever trained Zinder had 
a similar habit. And Terra’s the 
only planet in the universe that still 
clings to the base ten.” 

“Point taken, Tito. Your effi- 
ciency does you credit. It won’t go 
unrewarded, I promise you. But it 
does look as though there’s a hell of 
a storm brewing for Freetrade on 
Anharitte. From your observations, 
does this look like part of a de- 
liberate takeover by the House of 
Magda?” 

“No. Far worse than that. It 
looks like interference with the 
social structure by an inveterate do- 
gooder more interested in the wel- 
fare of the bottom four-fifths of the 
population than he is in legitimate 
profit.” 

“ ‘Curse all saviours of the 
human race — for they are 
responsible for most of the blacker 
parts of history!’ ” quoted Veste-

vaal despondently. He moved back 
to the window and began to watch 
the tall slave girl again, now 
examining her every movement 
with a wiser interest. “Damn it, 
Tito, you know we can’t let this 
happen, don’t you?’’ 

“I know it,’’ said Ren. “That’s 
the reason I called you in. I want 
permission, financing and backing 
to organize an opporition to the 
Imaiz." 

“Interference with the internal 
politics of an independent planet is 
an extremely dangerous business.’’ 

“But it wouldn’t be the first time 
it has been done. Nor is what I pro- 
pose strictly interference. It could 
rather be viewed as assistance in 
maintaining the existing balance of 
power. The Lords Di Rode and Di 
Guaard and the Lady T Ampere 
are scarcely going to side with the 
Imaiz and risk their income if not 
their lives if a revolution comes. Di 
Irons is the city prefect. He’s a bit 
of an unknown quantity in this, but 
he’s responsible for law and order, 
so I doubt if he’ll reject our as- 
sistance in maintaining the status 
quo. Most of the societies grow fat 
under the present regime, so they’re 
not going to welcome change either. 
And I’m sure the planetary 
government would love to have us 
thwart a provincial uprising for 
theih — if it were done with dis- 
cretion. That puts the major per- 



centage of wealth, influence and 
interests on our side. Give me the 
facilities and I’ll crush the Imaiz 
without leaving even a ripple on the 
surface.’’ 

“Not so fast, Tito. We’re nOt the 
only Company affected— or even 
the largest. And we’ve the merchant 
worlds to consider. Before we take 
any action that might affect the 
future of Anharitte as a freeport 
we’re going to need the approval of 
the Freetrade Council — most par- 
ticularly as insurance in case the 
venture goes sour on us. And before 
I dare approach the council I have 
to be absolutely certain that what 
you’ve told me is the truth. Not 
that I’m doubting you, of course, 
but it would be embarrassing if we 
were being manipulated into doing 
the dirty work for somebody who 
had a simple grudge against the 
Imaiz.” 

“I appreciate your caution. If 
you wish I’ll arrange for the senior 
scribes of the Society of Pointed 
Tails toi meet you so that you can 
question them directly.’’ 

“No need for that,’’ said Magno 
Vestevaal. “I think I can satisfy 
myself more easily.’’ He moved 
toward the door. 

“What had you in mind?’’ Ren 
rose to follow him. 

“I’m going downstairs, of course. 
To have a word with Zinder.’’ 

Ren’s eyebrows rose. “I wouldn’t 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE

advise it. And for God’s sake — re- 
member she’s well protected.” 

“It was the truth of that 
proposition I wished to test. If that 
fact holds true, then the rest of the 
story holds true.” 

Tito Ren sighed and reached for 
his sword belt. He paused only to 
fasten the ornate buckle before he 
followed the director out into the 
street. 

T he emergence of the two 
outworlders into the brilliant 
sunshine at the edge of the square — 
the director purposefully striding 
towards Zinder, and' Ren fol- 
lowing — caused an immediate thrill 
of interest to run through the 
market place. There was a quieting 
in the pace of the bargaining, 
though each man pretended still to 
be about his business. The agent 
sensed rather than saw the evasive 
group of figures who moved to 
strategic positions in the crowd, 
prepared for trouble. Worst of all 
was the unspoken wariness of the 
merchants, traditionally neutral in 
political affairs. If Vestevaal forced 
the incident into an affray, then 
even the dour men of small com- 
merce seemed likely to side with 
Zinder. 

Ren normally had complete con- 
fidence in Vestevaal’s ability to 
contain a crisis. However, Ren was 
from habit more attuned to the 



local undercurrents in Anharitte 
than Vestevaal could be. Purely 
from luck of “feel”^f the situation 
the director might provoke an ex- 
plosive incident. Under his tunic 
Ren could feel the comforting 
weight of his blaster. He would 
hesitate to use the' weapon in such a 
populated place, but, if necessity 
demanded, he could drop a dozen 
men with a single charge. 

“You there! Girl — come here.” 
Vestevaal was approaching Zinder, 
calling imperiously. She turned her 
head and waited for him, her face 
composed, as if the meeting were an 
event not unexpected. 

The director stopped suddenly as 
he realized she intended that he 
must l)e the one to walk the in- 
tervening distance if he wished to 
speak with her. She plainly did not 
propose to come to him. 

“1 said come,” said Vestevaal, 
knowing the delicate dictates of 
slave etiquette. 

She looked him up and down 
with shrewd appraisal, then turned 
back to the merchant at whose stall 
she was and continued her transac- 
tion. The director sensed that all 
eyes were upon him and wondered 
how he would resolve the offered 
slight. It was unthinkable for any 
slave other than Zinder to have dis- 
obeyed a public command from a 
man so obviously a prominent out- 
worlder. Vestevaal realized that he 



14 



IF 




had trapped himself into an open 
contest of wills. He could not afford 
to let the matter pass. 

He strode angrily across the 
remaining distance and caught hold 
of her left wrist, on which the slave 
mark was indelibly written. At 
close quarters she was attractive 
rather than beautiful in the classic 
sense. Her dark hair framed a 
strong face, which displayed an 
unassailable character. But more 
impressive was the rich by-play of 
emotions continuously monitored 
in her eyes. 

“I thought so — the House of 
Magda.” Vestevaal was em- 
phasizing the aspect of bondage, 
trying to draw a reaction. “Your 
master will be hearing from me. 
You’re the one they call Zinder, 
aren’t you?” 

“But of course. Director Veste- 
vaal. But then you knew that before 
you came across here. Indeed, I am 
the reason you came.” Her voice 
was clear and melodious, modu- 
lated with a subtle artistry. Her 
speech was perfectly articulated 
Terran in which the attractive lilt of 
the native Ahhn accent had been 
carefully preserved. “But I’m glad 
you did come. Peering from behind 
a curtain is rather undignified for a 
man of your standing with the 
Freetrade Council.” 

“Damn!” said Vestevaal, 
knowing that he was now the center 



of an attentive audience. “You take 
much on yourself, girl. Not only do 
you open wounds, but you also ap- 
ply salt.” 

“Salt? Only to the wounds of ene- 
mies,” she answered easily. 
“Among friends salt is for sharing 
at table. If I’ve off'ered salt. Di- 
rector, it’s you who have chosen 
how to use it.” 

I N HER deep eyes was no fear 
or displeasure, only an engaging 
challenge. Behind the eyes were 
limitless funds of resourcefulness. 
Though her lips were smiling 
slightly, they showed neither in- 
solence nor arrogance. She was 
meeting him on an equal level and 
both of them knew it. What had 
started as a deliberate confron- 
tation had ended in a rout for 
Vestevaal. His wry smile of admi- 
ration turned into a great gust of 
laughter and he reached this time 
for her right hand and kissed it. 

“As you so rightly said, Zinder, it 
was I who chose how to use the salt. 
But whereas a man can mostly 
choose his friends, circumstances 
choose his enemies for him. There 
are times when one could wish the 
reverse. Please present my compli- 
ments to the Imaiz — and tell him 
that if ever he wishes to dispose of 
your bond he will find in myself an 
eager purchaser.” 

“I will convey your words to 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



15 




Dion-daizan. Fm sure he’ll be both 
amused and flattered.” 

“And also tell him that I mean to 
stop him by every means at my dis- 
posal.” 

“That isn’t news. Director Veste- 
vaal. Had he not been convinced of 
it he would not have bothered 
sending me here today.” 

“He anticipated this meeting?” 
^’The chance of this or something 
like it was highly probable. He felt 
it only fair you should know the 
character of the opposition.” 

“He could scarcely have made 
the point more strongly.” 

“What else would you expect of 
the wizard4>f Anharitte?” 

She bowed respectfully and 
moved away like a colorful flower 
among the stalls, the barest hint of 
triumph on her lips. The tension 
that had held the cluttered market 
in a long hiatus drained slowly 
away and the noisy chaUer of 
bargaining returned. Ren, who had 
been silent to this moment, moved 
to the director’s elbow. 

“I told you I didn’t advise it,” he 
said critically. 

“You were right, Tito,” Magno 
Vestevaal told him. “I should have 
listened to you more carefully. 
Mark that round to the credit of the 
Imaiz. If that’s a sample of his 
tactics we’ll be needing more than 
moral support from the Freetrade 
Council.’’ 



“Then you’re satisfied with my 
assessment of the situation?” 

“Send word to have the shuttle 
readied for blast-off' as soon as I 
reach it. I’ll be calling an emer- 
gency session of the council and 
asking for their backing with all the 
facilities we ne^. With the evi- 
dence I shall give them I doubt 
there will even be a debate. In the 
meantime, you’re in charge here. 
You have my authority to draw 
whatever Company funds you need. 
Stop the Imaiz, neutralize his 
policy or just plain kill him — I 
don’t mind which. But if he turns 
many more slaves like Zinder loose 
in Anharitte we’re surely going to 
have another democracy on our 
hands. And what will become of 
Freetrade then?” 

Ill 

T O UNDERSTAND the 
function of the societies in An- 
haritte it was necessary to view 
them against the background of the 
uneasy truce local feudalism main- 
tained. The burgeoning space 
technology barely thrust out- 
side the city’s limits. Almost alone 
among the institutions of An- 
haritte, the societies had been 
forced to adapt to the twin pres- 
sures and now formed a precarious 
link at once joining and keeping 
separate the rival ways of life.

IF 




Historically the societies had 
been clans of skilled mercenary sol- 
diers who offered their services to 
any who found it beneficial to use 
hired arms rather than maintain 
their own forces. In either attacking 
or defensive roles, the clans had 
played a great part in the early for- 
mation of the “kingdoms” from 
which the great Houses of Roget 
had emerged after the adoption of 
central government. 

With the coming of less turbulent 
times the societies had found new 
exercise for their warlike crafts. 
When the thriving communities had 
outgrown the protection afforded 
by the great castles on the three 
hills, the merchants outside the 
citadels had become exposed to at- 
tacks by Tyrene pirates who came 
up the broad Aprillo river. Many 
merchants had then found it 
expedient to use the armed services 
of the societies to protect their 
homes and warehouses. From this 
had evolved the contract system 
whereby a merchant engaged a so- 
ciety for protection but paid for the 
service only as and when it was re- 
quired. This function, too, sharp- 
ened the efficiency of the societies 
themselves, because the best pro- 
tection contracts went to the clans 
with the proven ability to preserve 
the life and wealth of their patrons. 

As piracy became a less profit- 
able profession, the idea of

contract protection remained. Al- 
ways adaptable, the societies were 
swift to monitor the change and 
quick to evolve new services tp of- 
fer. Slave control in the expanding 
estates was an obvious extension. 
The passing of two disastrous 
plagues brought about the introduc- 
tion of society hospitals. Frequent 
fires in the huddled wooden 
buildings caused the initiation of 
society fire services. Thus the out- 
world concept of insurance found a 
more personal and practical 
analogue in Anharitte. 

Yet the warrior function of the 
societies was not forgotten. A man 
with the price might still arrange 
for the skilled disposal of his rival 
or the waging of a feud with an 
enemy. While the taking of life in 
Anharitte was not necessarily a 
crime, disturbance of the peace of 
the city was an offense. The soci- 
eties learned to conduct their affairs 
with great discretion under the grim 
and scowling eyes of a prefecture 
which neither approved nor disap- 
proved of what they did — provided 
the quiet life of the city was main- 
tained. 

The coming of the spaceport had 
further enhanced the societies’ role. 
No outworlders were permitted to 
hold property titles on Roget — a 
necessary pr^aution for a culture 
intending to preserve its own 
identity in the face of commercial 



outworld interests — but there was 
nothing to stop outworlders en- 
tering into contracts with a society 
and leasing buildings held in the so- 
ciety’s name. The same applied to 
slave-bonds and to every other form 
of transaction that had to be regis- 
tered with the prefecture. Thus the 
societies, inextricably part of the 
old culture, became also the bridge- 
head of the new. 

As a Company agent more astute 
than most, Tito Ren had long since 
learned the value of an in-depth 
study both of the history and the 
cultural mores of the territories to 
which he was assigned. Thus he had 
been quick to recognize the 
multiple role of the societies and 
equally quick to adapt the system 
to his own requirements. His re- 
searches had shown the Society of 
Pointed Tails to be not only the 
most efficient of the available clans, 
but also the one still most proficient 
in the use of arms in situations 
where the rudimentary laws of 
Roget could not be bent sufilciently 
to gain t^ necessary advantage for 
an ambitious freetrader. 

Ren had wooed the members of 
Pointed Tails by concentrating his 
considerable leasings of property, 
services and local labor with them. 
He pursued his advantage by of- 
fering them well-paid investigation 
assignments probing those aspects 
of life in Anharitte he found of 



18 



IF 




interest. Now he was ready to move 
into the next phase— that of ac- 
tually using the Pointed Tails as an 
instrument with which to manipu- 
late particular elements of An- 
haritte society itself. He was pre- 
pared to recognize, however, that a 
society as competent as the Pointed 
Tails would not be likely to accept 
his propositions without question. 
Nor was he wrong. 

C ATUUL GRAS, senior scribe 
of the Society of Pointed Tails, 
looked questioningly at Ren. 

“You’ve already spoken with 
your director, then?” 

“I have — and he’s in complete 
agreement. The Imaiz will have to 
be stopped. The director has al- 
ready given me access to whatever i 
Company funds I need in order to 
make a preliminary approach, to 
you — and now he has gone to con- 
sult with the Freetrade Council. If 
they concur. I’ll have unlimited 
funding from the Galactic Bank it- 
self and whatever additional fa- 
cilities I choose to call on.” 

“And you wish the Pointed Tails 
to prepare a scheme of harassment 
and feud against Dion-daizan?” 

“I need more than a feud. I need 
to crush Diori-daizan. Harassment 
may have its place — but if it doesn’t 
bring results I’m prepared to con- 
sider anything short of full-scale 
warfare.” 



“And the Prefect Di Irons? Do 
you think he’s going to sit by hap- 
pily while -you wage war on the 
Imaiz?"’ 

“I intend to seek the support of 
all the lords of Anharitte, Di Irons 
among thejn. If we can gain their 
backing plus that of the Freetrade 
Council, the Imaiz won’t stand a 
chance.” 

Catuul, his brilliant robes flowing 
about his muscled body, took a 
pensive turn around Ren’s book- 
lined chamber. He was obviously 
not enthusiastic. 

“I think you oversimplify about 
the lords,” he said. “Di Irons will 
never support you in an overt act of 
war against the Imaiz, whatpvw his 
private sympathies. Di Guaard is so 
insane he’s still holding an inqui- 
sition to find pirates who became 
extinct two generations ago. Di 
Rode will listen to you, but he’s un- 
likely actively to support an out- 
worlder against another House of 
Anharitte. Only the Lady 
T’ Ampere appears as a possible 
ally--thought I doubt you’d be pre- 
pared to pay her price for the 
alliance.” 

“And the Society of Pointed 
Tails?” asken Ren. “Will they sup- 
port me?” 

Catuul frowned. “I can’t an- 
ticipate the decision of my fellow 
scribes. I’ll call an immediate 
meeting of the lodge and recom-

mend they take your assignment. ' 
But there will be much argument.” 
‘‘What’s there to argue about?” 
‘‘About the possibility of losing 
the fight. It’s easy enough for you 
to wave money and say you want to 
crush the Imaiz. But did you never 
think that Dion-daizan may prove 
powerful enough to crush the lot of 
us?” 

‘‘That isn’t possible,” said Ren. 
‘‘Because whatever strengths he 
has, I can call on resources to 
match his ten times over. This is 
one fight you can’t possibly lose.” 
“Your thinking is typical of an 
outworlder’s,” said Catuul. “You 
don’t appreciate Dion’s con- 
siderable influence with the bond- 
slaves — or his command of magic. 
Believe me, you under-estimate his 
potential, or you would not so 
lightly engage in plans for his 
destruction.” 

“Dion-daizan is a fraud. He’s a 
Terran adventurer — with no more 
occult powers than you or I.” 

Catuul shrugged. “Call him by 
any name you like. We know him 
as a formidable and unforgiving 
enemy. He never aillows an injury to 
pass unavenged.” 

“I can always approach another 
society if the Pointed Tails have 
cowards among their members,” 
said Ren coldly. 

“Cowards?” Catuul swung on 
him angrily. There are none braver 



or more dedicated than the Pointed 
Tails. It isn’t they ;who might 
falter — but you.” 

“IT’ Ren was perplexed. 

“Of course. If the society accepts 
your assignment every man is com- 
mitted to the death. But you have 
the op^tion to rescind the contract at 
any time. If the going gets too 
rough you can retreat offworld to 
lick your wounds and total up your 
losses. But we can’t. We have to 
continue operating here in An- 
haritte — and the Imaiz makes no 
distinction between those who are 
paid to injure him and those who do 
the paying. Only the scrolls tell of 
the remains of societies who once 
tangled with the Imaiz and lost.” 

“Nevertheless,” said Ren, “that 
isn’t going to happen. If ever I drew 
back, the Freetrade Council would 
replace me with another. They can’t 
afford to do otherwise. And their 
resources have no limit — they can 
acquire them a thousand times 
faster than we can exhaust them. 
I’m oflering you the backing of a 
dozen merchant worlds and seven 
hundred space companies and com- 
bines — to fight one man and a 
handful of slaves. Tell that to the 
other scribes and see if they share 
your doubts.” 

“I’ll tell them,” said Catuul 
gravely, gathering his robe across 
his arm. “And I think they’ll be 
convinced. But it will be a close de- 



20 



IF 




cision. I’ll let you have our answer 
in the morning.” 

W ’HEN Catuul had departed 
Ren turned his attention to 
the radio link with the space ter- 
minal. From the spaceport the 
powerful FTL communications 
equipment reached out in real time 
to the relay chains across the vast- 
nesses of commercial Interstellar 
space. In response to his inquiry he 
learned that an incoming call from 
Freetrade Central was already 
logged a mere five hours away. Fi- 
nally Vestevaal’s voice came 
through. 

“Tito, can you hear me clearly?” 
“Yes, Director. Transmission is 
good. Did the council meeting go in 
your favor?” 

“It did indeed. They were even 
more perturbed than we — espe- 
cially those who have big invest- 
ments nearer the Rim. The out- 
come is that we’ve ^ot all the sup- 
port we need. The Galactic Bank 
will give you unrestricted credit. 
Any Freetrade ships calling at An- 
haritte will be obliged to offer as- 
sistance — and the merchant worlds 
of Combien and Ranee are 
donating a light battle cruiser to be 
set down on Anharitte for the du- 
ration of the exercise. The battle 
cruiser will have most of the fa- 
cilities you might require in the way 



of laboratories, trained com- 
mandos, communications, arma- 
ments and the like. You’ve enough 
there to start a war if you should 
need to.” 

“It mustn’t come to that,” said 
Ren. “If we upset the planetary 
government we’ll be thrown off' 
Roget for sure. Our best chance is 
to try to woo the local lords to our 
side, then to Tight an undercover 
campaign against the Imaiz. Then 
we can divide Magda’s share of the 
spaceport royalties among the 
remaining Houses and expect the 
dust to settle pretty fast.” 

“You’re the man on the spot, 
Tito, so it’s your advice that counts. 
I’ll be returning to Roget shortly, 
but purely as an observer and to 
maintain liaison with the Freetrade 
Council. 1 may advise on policy, 
but the strategy and conduct of the 
battle will be entirely your affair. I 
hope that arrangement is to your 
liking.” 

“I couldn’t have asked for better. 
Terran or no Terran, if we have 
modern weapons and the support of 
the other lords, the Imaiz hasn’t got 
a chance.” 

“I wish I completely shared your 
confidence,” said Magno Veste- 
vaal, signing off. “But Zinder 
didn’t have to make that con- 
frontation in the market. For the 
moment I almost wondered if the 
Imaiz wasn’t spoiling for a fight. 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



21 




C ATUUL GRAS came back 
the next morning with the 
Pointed Tails’ acceptance of the of- 
fer. The price was high, but Ren 
brushed aside the financial con- 
siderations. ""You managed to Find 
agreement, then?” 

Catuul grimaced. “Some of the 
scribes had reservations, but they’re 
all alarmed by what the Imaiz is 
doing. Certainly they respond to 
your argument that if we’re to 
maintain things in Anharitte as 
they now stand, some form of 
action is^ necessary to curtail Dion- 
daizah. The fact that you’re willing 
to finance and supply backing for 
the skirmish makes it easier for us 
to do what we should finally have 
been forced to do anyway. In some 
ways this is an alliance — and there 
are other societies who may con- 
tribute to our cause.” - 
Ren held out his hand in accep- 
Unce of the bargain. “Then it’s set- 
tled. TYit Imaiz will be stopped.” 
“He will b^. But initially we must 
proceed by> customary feud and 
harassment. Only if these measures 
aren’t effective can we consider out- 
right war.” 

“I’ll accept that,” said Ren. 
“You start to prepare a campaign 
against the /mmr. I’ll do some pre- 
liminary canvassing for support 
among the other lords. I suggest we 
meet again in two days time to 
decide our plan of action.” 



A S REN left his office he was 
L at once aware of being ob- 
served. He had not gone far 
through the quaint and narrow 
streets before a prefecture 
watchman approached him. 

“Agent Ren?” 

“The same.” The watchman had 
obviously been waiting for him to 
emerge. “What services can 1 
offer?” 

“If you please, you will accom- 
pany me to the prefecture. Lord Di 
Irons wishes to speak with you.” 
“And I with him,” said Ren, 
though he recognized the summons 
for the imperious demand tjiat it 
was. If he had thought of declining 
the invitation the appearance of two 
more watchmen behind him 
pointed up the wisdom of cheerful 
compliance. 

Even in the bright sun the 
prefecture looked cold and unin- 
viting. The wide portals shaded the 
exterior brilliance quickly into a 
dim chill that seemed resident in the 
very fabric of the building. Tito 
Ren could not repress a shiver as he 
entered the main door. The stone 
corridors of the law were always an 
anathema to him. 

Di Irons’ office was large and 
grimly impressive. On the same 
scale was the man himself. Huge, 
bearded, and with a shock of rust- 
red, unruly hair, he was as unlike 
the typical Ahhn as was Ren him- 



22 



IF 




self. His very presence spoke of 
strength and granite resolution. The 
prefect was obviously not a man to 
be li gh tly deflected from his task. 

“Agent Ren — ” the handshake 
was a mere formality — “I’ve asked 
you here because we need ^ better 
understanding of each other. My 
job is to maintain the law in An- 
haritte. Yours is to run a profitable 
exchange of trade through our sea 
and spaceport facilities. It would be 
a pity if in pursuit of our respective 
duties we should happen to 
collide.’’ 

“Indeed a pity.” Ren shifted un- 
comfortably on his chair. 
“However, I think the possibility is 
slight. We traders are aware that 
we remain hpre on sufferance.” 

“Don’t fence with me,” said Di 
Irons savagely. “I spoke of under- 
standing. We both know that the 
lords of Anharitte are as much de- 
pendent on your money as you are 
upon access to the freeport fa- 
cilities. So let’s speak frankly. I 
know that you and your director 
intend making feud with the 
Imaiz." 

Ren examined his inquisitor 
warily. “You know of that?” 

“Of course. Not much occurs in 
Anharitte that isn’t known in the 
prefecture. Whether or not we 
choose to act on what we know de- 
pends on our interpretation of the 
law. Provocation isn’t an offense. 



But if Vestevaal had struck Zinder 
the other day we’d have been very 
much concerned.” 

“To protect a slave?” Ren af- 
fected a measure of surprise he did 
not feel. 

Di Irons’ voice was quieter now 
but just as dangerous. “No. We 
would have had to intervene to 
protect yoiir stupid hides. And that 
offends our idea of preservation of 
the peace. You’re no stranger here, 
Ren. You know which way the tides 
flow in Anharitte.” 

“I know it,” said Ren, “but the 
director needed proof of my in- 
terpretation.” 

“Well, I gather he got it. But I 
don’t advise him to make an open 
confrontation like that again. 
Zinder has too many sympathizers 
to make it a healthy pastime. But 
what escapes me is why your di- 
rector needed proof of her ability to 
cut him down to size.” 

“Because it’s my contention that 
if the Imaiz continues to educate 
slaves to her level, the slave struc- 
ture will crumble. Your society as it 
now exists will crumble. Don’t ask 
me what will replace it — but it will 
certainly be a system with less 
tolerance toward Freetrade than 
the one we enjoy at the moment.” 
“So that’s it.” Di Irons was sud- 
denly caught by the speculation. 

“You asked for understanding,” 
said Ren. “Well, I’ve shown my 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



23 




blade. Now dare you return the ges- 
ture? 1 -don’t imagine you lords of 
Anharitte would look upon the 
withdrawal of Freetrade with much 
favor.” 

“No!” Di Irons reacted violently. 
“You’ll not involve me in politics. 
The Imaiz may be ill advised in the 
way he treats his slaves. But if I 
were to take arms against every 
slavemaster I considered ill advised 
I would not have half enough cells 
in which to hold them — or a tenth 
enough tormentors to make their 
stay uncomfortable. In any case, I 
think you’re reading more into this 
than is written. I know Dion well. 
He’s U frequent guest in my 
household.” 

“And Zinder? Is she a frequent 
guest, too? A slave?” 

“If Dion wills it. A slavemaster’s 
rights over his bondslaves are ab- 
solute — and that’s a principle I 
must uphold. If he chooses to pretty 
her and pamper her it’s no concern 
of mine. She would not be the first 
bondslave to become a favored con- 
cubine — though I’ll not say that’s 
what she is. If Dion is pleased to 
bring her to my table I’ll be the last 
to interfere. In any case, Zinder’s a 
charming and cultured girl.” 

“And you approve of a bond- 
slave’s being educated to this 
level?” 

“I don’t necessarily approve 
when a master has a slave stoned to 



death for some imagined slight. My 
function is not to judge but to main- 
tain the law. Thus far I’ve no evi- 
dence that Dion-dfaizan has broken 
it.” 

“Then you’re not willing to^a^ist 
us in protecting Anharitte from the 
Imaiz' s slave policy?” 

“I’m not even convinced there is 
any threat. A man who owns slaves 
must always be on guard against re- 
bellion — and I fancy Dion runs less 
risk of this than most. But above 
all, the law must be neutral — or it 
ceases to be law and becomes 
tyranny. Let it not be said that a 
prefect of Anharitte used his 
position to persecute others on the 
word of an outworld merchant’s 
agent. 

“If you think you have a griev- 
ance against Dion-daizan you can 
have recourse to the supreme court 
in Gaillen. Or you can attempt to 
achieve satisfaction through the 
services of a society. But let them 
advise you on tactics. The societies 
know how to operate with dis- 
cretion. If your feud moves into the 
public realm I shall act — and act 
decisively and without favor. Do I 
make myself clear?” 

“Would you also move against 
the Imaiz if the necessity arose?” 

“The lords of Anharitte have 
certain rights of arms. Outside 
those, whoever destroys the peace 
of Anharitte will be forced to ac-

IF 




count to nic. That goes for the 
Imaiz, for the other lords — and 
most especially for you, Ren. Agent 
you may be, but if you assume the 
role of agent provocateur then 
you’ll not find us so hospitable.” 
Ren scowled with disap- 
pointment. “I doubt the other lords 
would condone your tolerance 
toward the activities of Dion-daizan 
and his slaves.” 



T ^HE prefect exploded in 

anger. “You’re an outworlder, 
Ren. Don’t try and tell me what Di 
Rode and Di Guaard and the Lady 
T’ Ampere would or wouldn’t think. 
I was raised with these people. I 
know what they think better than 
they know it themselves.” 

“But you weren’t raised with the 
Imaiz/' said Ren coldly. “Because 
the suggestion is very strong that 
he’s a Terran. Don’t tell me that 
doesn’t offend your precious law?” 
For the first time Di Irons 
seemed unsure of himself. 

“You have evidence to support 
that statement?” ^ 

“No positive proof as yet. But I 
will have. Don’t you query the 
rights of the claimants to your aris- 
tocratic Housfes?” 

“Query?” Di Irons was grimly 
amused. “Do you think I would 
dare look closely at the credentials 
of Di Rode or Di Guaard — or they 



at mine? How many murdered in- 
fants^ do you suppose would ^e 
found in the moats? Which unfortu- 
: nate son went alive into his tomb 
behind the new wall in the tower? 
Whose mother is that demented 
crone who . has sat in chains for 
thirty years in the dungeon? The 
rights of the title go to the claimant 
with the ability to survive at the 
top. The state acknowledges the 
title of the House — the holder of 
the title declares himself.” 

“1 understand all that,” said Ren 
patiently. “But surely the position 
is different if the occupant of the. 
title is an outworlder?” 

“It would be — if the matter could 
be proved. Then I would have to 
act. But you’ve admitted you don’t 
have the evidence^ Until you do, I 
submit you’re playing a very 
dangerous game.” 

“Dangerous in what way?” asked 
Ren. 

“I know Dion well. He’s shrewd, 
resourceful — and his information is 
impeccable. What do you think 
he’ll be doing while you wander the 
countryside trying to stir trouble 
against him? I strongly advise you 
to guard your back, not to visit 
dark places alone and to engage a 
taster to test your food. If you were 
to die — I’m sure I’d have a hard 
time trying to hang the responsi- 
bility on Dion-daizan.” 

“I’ll remember that. But in the 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



25 




meantime, think' over what I’ve 
said. I doubt even you would refuse 
a quarter of Magda’s share of the 
income from the spaceports con- 
cession.” 

“I prize ssome things above 
money,” said Di Irons. “And one 
of them is life. Nobody in his senses 
provokes a needless quarrel with a~ 
man as far-reaching and formidable 
as Dion-daizan. I know it’s not 
fashionable among Freetraders to 
speak of magic and superstition, 
but some of the works of the Imaiz 
are well beyond the powers of 
man.” 

“That I must yet have proved to 
me,” said Tito Ren. “For^the 
moment 1 prefer to regard him 
merely as an academic Terran ad- 
venturer with ho supernatural 
powers.” 

“It would be churlish of me,” 
said Di Irons, “not to wish you a 
successful venture. If what you’ve 
told me is true I stand to gain or 
lose as much as you. But I would 
need more reason than you’ve given 
before l iaised my hand against the 
wizard of Anharitte. Take care, 
merchant. You’ve chosen a 
stronger enemy than you think.” 

The conversation was interrupted 
by a knock on the door. A 
watchman came in, apologized for 
the intrusion and handed Di Irons a 
note. The latter read it, looked 
questioningly at Ren for a 



moment — then his face broke into a 
wry smile. 

“It appears I spoke more truly 
than I knew. Don’t tell me after this 
that you don’t believe in the powers 
of the Imaiz." 

“Why? What’s happened?” 

“You rent a bonded oil and spirit 
warehouse on the quayside of First- 
water?” 

“1 do.” Ren was half on his feet. 
“What’s the trouble?” 

“It’s on fire,” said Di Irons. 
“You had best get down there. I 
think this will not be the last con- 
versation we’ll be having on the 
matter, so you have my permission 
to proceed. But tomorrow I’ll be 
asking questions. I don’t tolerate 
the destruction of property in a pri- 
vate feud — and if I find proof that 
either you or Dion^^daizan has done 
this deliberately, an accounting will 
have to be made.” 

“I’m not likely to set fire to my 
own warehouse,” said Ren bitterly. 

“And Dion’s not stupid enough 
to indulge in ordinary arson,” said 
Di Irons. “Or in any event. I’ve 
never been able to prove he is. If 
you find me some proof, Ren, I’ll 
guarantee to lay it where it 
belongs.” 

IV. 

R en thought of returning to his 
- chambers for his cushioncraft.

IF 




Then he realized that the poling of 
the vehicle by stavebearers through 
the city streets and down the Trade 
Road would be a slow and tiresome 
business. A mule cart would be 
quicker — but not much. The total 
distance from the prefecture to 
Firstwater was no greater than two 
kilometers and much of the way lay 
down the slopes of Firsthill into the 
valley formed with Thirdhill on the 
other shore. Overall he calculated 
he could make the journey more 
quickly on foot and he set out at a 
labored jog — with complete dis- 
regard for lack of dignity or sweat. 

He had barely cleared the fringes 
of the buildings and come out at the 
end of the Trade Road overlooking 
Firstwater when he became aware 
of the broad smoke column rising 
into the sultry air. If he had thought 
the fire might only be a minor one 
his surmise was soon corrected. 
Even through the dense smoke 
cloud he could see the bright seat of 
the flame — and its visibility at this 
distance told him that the confla- 
gration must be total as far as his 
installation was concerned. 

The Trade Road was easy to ne- 
gotiate. Such carts as were on it 
were also moving downhill, laden 
with spectators eager to witness the 
fire. Most of these vehicles, braked 
with iron wedges and chains against 
the slope, were easily overtaken, 
and his urgent running raised a 



great deal of amused comment. On 
the Via Arena the crowds thickened 
and the road to Magda Crossing 
was nearly impassable in the di- 
rection of the river. Fortunately a 
group of Pointed Tails met him and 
forg^ him a path through the mobs 
to a point near the burning 
warehouse. 

The Pointed Tails’ fire appliance 
was there — with all its hand- 
cranked absurdity. So obviously 
inadequate was it against the 
roaring inferno that confronted it 
that it had not been put into even 
token use. Two other societies had 
also brought their appliances, but 
these were equally useless and stood 
well clear of the outer perimeter 
fence, where they would not be af- 
fected by the intense heat. 

The fire itself was overwhelming. 
The whole building, with walls of 
massive stone blocks, vibrated with 
the tremendous roar of the furnace 
within. The structure had no win- 
dows, and the two exterior doors 
jetted streams of angry flame like 
enormous blowlamps. The roof, 
once a structure of heavily tarred 
wood, was completely gone. Sur- 
mounting the walls was a con- 
tinuous crown of fire, which 
produced such intense heat that the 
spectators had to move back re- 
peatedly to avoid being scorched. 

The warehouse ' had two pe- 
rimeter fences, one contained 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



27 




within the other, but it was now im- 
possible to approach the building 
nearer than the confines of the 
outer fence. Here Ren found Catuul 
Gras, his face heavy red from the 
heat, Catuul was watching the 
progress of the conflagration with 
frank disbelief. His expressive 
glance at Ren suggested both 
physical and mental agony. He ges- 
tured toward his own useless fire 
appliance. 

“I took the liberty of calling on 
the spaceport for emergency as- 
sistance. I hope I didYight/' 

‘‘Exactly right,” approved Ren. 
‘‘How did the fire start?” 

‘‘We don’t know. No goods have 
moved in or out of the warehouse 
for fifteen days. Everything was se- 
cure on the last round of the society 
guards and the picket between the 
fences has been strictly maintained. 
The fire started behind locked 
doors and we’re certain that no- 
body could have entered.” 

‘‘Could some sort of time fuse or 
incendiary mechanism have been 
placed inside?” 

Catuul grimaced. ‘‘1 know of no 
device obtainable hereabouts with 
such a long delay. But if you’re 
thinking this is the work of the 
Imaiz you pose a paradox. Those 
doors were sealed several days be- 
fore your quarrel with Dion-daizan 
became actual. You could only sus- 
pect his hand if you were prepared 



to credit him with the magical 
powers you deny he possesses.” 
‘‘Nevertheless, the timing’s too 
perfect to be a matter of coinci- 
dence. Even Di Irons hinted he sus- 
pected that the Imaiz was behind it. 
Well, if it is Dion’s work and 
there’s any evidence left to prove it, 
it will give us a good start for our 
harassment. Di Irons is all set to 
string up the Imaiz by the thumbs if 
he’s found responsible for the 
destruction of property during a 
private feud. All he needs is proof— 
and here come the boys who can 
give it to us.” 



M ovement among the 
watchers on the road sig- 
naled the arrival of the cushion- 
craft emergency tender from the 
spaceport. Behind it came two 
more tenders containing compound 
foam and chemicals and were deftly 
manipulated into place. In com- 
plete contrast to the laughable 
native fire appliances, these three 
vehicles, normally reserved for 
spacecrash emergencies, were mag- 
nificently equipped and manned by 
trained and competent crews. 
Within seconds the great pumps 
were working and hoses were being 
run out as far as the river to bring in 
the additional water necessary to 
complete the work of the foam 
coverage. 



28 



IF 




Pictor Don, the spaceport’s emer- 
gency commander, spared neither 
Ren nor Catuul a glance as he de- 
ployed his facilities for maximum 
effect. The foam from the hoses hit 
the side of the building and 
wherever it touched it solidified into 
glass slag and instantly formed an 
air-excluding seal that was also an 
impressive heat-reducing barrier. 
The properties of the solidifying 
foam were such that it could easily 
withstand the temperatures in- 
volved, while its noncommuni- 
cating cellular structure was light, 
yet strong enough to prevent the 
collapse of all but the heaviest parts 
of buildings. In dealing with a fire 
of these proportions the shell of the 
building could literally be filled 
with foam in a matter of minutes 
with a hundred per cent expectation 
of complete extinction of the fire. 

The radiated heat fell away dra- 
matically as the foam blanket 
coated the waUs and the forecourt. 
Ren and Catuul followed the fire 
team nearer as the work of filling 
the building’s shell with foam 
began. After a short while, 
however, they became aware that 
something was wrong — the flames 
in the interior, instead of yielding, 
had become concentrated in one 
central spot and now roared like a 
volcano. The flare hurled large 
pieces of congealed foam high into 
the air to fall at a distance, to the 



intense consternation of the 
onlookers. 

Finally Pictor Don dropped down 
from his command point and came 
over to Ren. 

“What have you got in there, 
Tito? Rocket fuel?’’ 

The agent shook his head. “No. 
Mainly high-grade crude oils and 
essential oils waiting shipment 
offworld to Ranee for refining.’’ 

“But the oxidants,’’ protested 
Don. “You should know better 
than to store oxidants with 
flammables.’’ 

“There are no okidants there. In 
fact, no tonnages of oxidants are 
available on Roget.’’ 

Pictor Don shook his head. 
“That foam can extinguish 
anything up to and including a 
blazing well-head without trouble. 
But you’ve got something in there 
that could have put the whole 
building comfortably into orbit had 
the jet been pointed down instead of 
up. A few tons of liquid oxygen 
would do the trick with your high- 
grade oil — but without oxygen you 
couldn’t produce a flare like that in 
a million years.^’ 

“No oxygen,’’ said Ren. “There’s 
not a liquid oxygen plant within 
sixteen light-years of Roget and 
it’s a dead certainty that oxygen is 
not imported.’’ 

A cry from a member of the fire 
team indicated that the situation 



the wizard of ANHARITTE 



29 




was changing. Pictor Don returned 
to his post and Ren saw the bright 
plume of flame above the building 
gradually diminish and finally be- 
come extinguished by the solidi- 
fying foam. The fire was out. 

“What happens now?’’ asked 
Catuul. 

“First they extract the heat from 
the surface by cooling the mass 
with water. Then they progressively 
add alkali to the water and this 
slowly dissolves the foam. By con- 
trol of what they spray they can 
stop the process at any point to al- 
low the removal of potentially 
dangerous masonry or to inspect 
for signs of arson before the evi- 
dence is too much disturbed.’’ 



T 'HE fire team was now spraying 
riyer water from its hoses, but 
such was the heat-insulating effec- 
tiveness of the cellular mass that 
very little of the intense heat still 
trapped belo>y the surface was 
available to be carried away by the 
water. Pictor Don mounted a hy- 
draulic hoist and climbed from it 
to the surface of the foam filling the 
building’s walls. The strength of the 
glasslike substance was such that 
his weight barely dented the sur- 
face. He scrunched over almost the 
entire area of the warehouse on a 
quick tour of inspection. 

He ordered alkali to be applied. 



About a thirty-centimeter layer of 
the foam was stripped from the sur- 
face by chemical leaching. Newly 
exposed fragments of the building 
were cooled ' with water and a 
second round of inspection 
followed. 

Then the emergency commander 
approached the edge of the building 
and called over the wall. “Get Tito 
Ren up here — and that Pointed Tail 
fellow.’’ 

Somewhat reluctantly Ren and 
Catuul Gras allowed themselves to 
be conducted to the hoist and raised 
to the top of the wall. There was 
something unnerving about step- 
ping onto a layer of foam that had 
been a sprayable liquid such a short 
time before. The surface felt 
alarmingly fragile. Overcoming 
their fears, however, the two 
walked across the crunching sur- 
face toward Pictor Don. At a 
certain point he cautioned them to 
stop. 

“Mind where you put your feet in 
that area just in front of you. 
There’s a giant bubble in the foam 
reaching, as far as 1 can judge, right 
down to base level. That was the 
blowhole through which the last 
flame persisted. Unless I miss my 
guess, the root cause of the fire lies 
directly at the bottom end of that 
bubble. Does its position give you 
any clues?’’ 

Catuul glanced around at the 



30 



IF 




fra gm ents of outer wall visible 
above the foam, trying to verify his 
bearings. “We’re located over what 
was the inner storeroom.” 

“What was kept in there?” 

“The high-grade crude oil,” said 
Ren. 

“In metal tanks?” 

“No. Wooden barrels. It’s the 
only way the native producers will 
package it. Wharfage facilities 
don’t run to the accommodation of 
tankers.” 

“Wasn’t there anything else?” 
Pictor Don was completely uncon- 
vinced. 

“Nothing,” said Ren. “I counted 
the barrels myself. We werb going 
to repackage the whole con- 
signment in spaceweight containers 
ready for shipment. And every 
single barrel was broached to ob- 
tain analysis samples, so I can 
guarantee that the store con- 
tained nothing but high-grade oil.” 
“Very well.” Pictor Don’s voice 
still carried no evidence of convic- 
tion. He indicated that they should 
all return to the ground. The 
chemical stripping of the foam 
began again, with interruptions at 
intervals for repeated inspections. 
Finally Don again called for Ren 
and Catuul Gras. 

The thickness of the foam had 
been reduced to a meter. The space 
around the blowhole had been- com- 
pletely cleared for a radius of 

THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



several meters. Ren and his col- 
league were now able to inspect the 
area Pictor Don regarded as the 
base of the fire. 

“A drain — ” Ren regarded the' 
charred and blackened area of the 
floor with astonishment. 

“Yes.” Don was critical. “A 
drain you used to take the overspill 
of oil during the sampling of the 
barrels for analysis, perhaps?” 
“There was some oil spillage,” 
agreed Ren. “But I don’t see — ” 
“Where does the drain lead?” 

“To the river, I should hope.” 

S econds later he was running 
across the broad forecourt 
toward the river, a sudden suspicion 
in his mind. The banks were com- 
plex with piers and moorings and 
wharves, but hard against the bank 
protruded one particular pipe 
whose end even now drained black 
dregs from the disastrous fire. The 
marks of a coupling that had been 
placed over the pipe’s end were 
plainly visible — the coupling itself 
was gone, along with the craft that 
undoujbtedly had borne it. 

Angrily Ren scanned the river. 
The slow drift of barges and ships — 
left toward the spaceport and right 
toward the shipping lanes and the 
sea — was a complex movement that 
defied analysis. The number of 
barges and ships provided too much 
information for Ren to be able to 

31 




determine which craft might be 
e^ripped^with couplings to hold 
against his particular drain and dis- 
charge tonnage quantities of oxi- 
dant under pressure into the in- 
terior of the warehouse. Here was 
plain evidence of sabotage, but no 
proof of the sort that could be used 
to point a finger at Dion-daizan. 

“It was a honey of a scheme,” 
Ren said later in grudging admi- 
ration. “We’ll never convince Di 
Irons of the truth — ” 

Pictor Don had himself lowered 
on a cradle down to the entrance of 
the pipe. Here he explored with an 
instruments. ^ 

“The water from the hoscdown 
has washed out all real evidence,” 
he said. “But I’d guess somebody’s 
been feeding pure oxygen up this 
pipe — and I’d say the probability 
was high that it was obtained by 
boiling off liquid oxygen.” 

“And the ignition?” asked Ren. 
“They wouldn’t need to bother. 
The oil would ignite spontaneously 
as the oxygen concentration went 
up. You’ve been rather cleverly 
sabotaged, Tito.” 

“And no prizes for guessing by 
whom,” said Ren morosely. 

“I thought you said there was no 
tonnage oxygen available on 
Roget?” 

“There are no plants that we’re 
aware of, Pictor. Native industry 
isn’t that far advanced. But I’m 



wondering if there aren’t oxygen fa- 
cilities in Castle Magda. A good , 
Terran technician supplied with the 1 
sort of money the spaceport dues 
provide shouldn’t have too much 
trouble building a liquid oxygen 
plant — or any other technical fa- 
cility, when you come to think of 
it.” 

“But I don’t see,” said Catuul 
Gras, “how it could be known that 
putting Something up that par- 
ticular pipe would result in a fire in 
our warehouse. There are hundreds 
of similar pipes to choose from. In 
any case, the drain at the other end 
of the pipe might not have been in 
the right position.” 

“I think I know how that was de- 
cided,” said Ren. “Somebody 
worked out the details of that epi- 
sode from inside the warehouse.” 
He indicated the gang of slaves now 
filing back into the warehouse com- 
pound ready to start the work of de- 
molition and clearance. 

“If the Imaiz could bring Zinder 
to Terran graduate standard, how 
many other slaves has he similarly 
educated and then resold? It’s 
slightly unnerving to think that we 
could have one or two graduate 
chemists working as bondslaves in 
our establishments. Think what an 
effective fifth column that would 
make. Is it possible, Catuul, that 
we’ve acquired some slaves the 
Imaiz might have trained?” 



IF 



32 




“It’s possible. “The Imaiz buys 
and sells many slaves, using many 
different auctioneers. Nobody save 
the prefeet would have a continous 
record of any single slave’s history. 
Dion-daizan could hold one for 
years and then return him to the 
market — and nobody would be the 
wiser.’’ 

“But the auctioneers keep 
records of their individual triansac- 
tions?’’ 

“They keep all normal records by 
way of trade. What did you have in 
mind?’’ 

“I doubt Di Irons will allow us 
access to the prefecture records. 
But I need an individual history for 
every slave we possess. Go back to 
the auctioneers and use whatever 
pressures you must to obtain copies 
of their records relating to the 
slaves in whom we’re interested. I’ll 
have a computer programed at the 
spaceport. With it we should be 
able to reconstruct individual his- 
tories — I want to know of any slave 
whose bond has been with the Imaiz 
for one year or more.’’ 

“With what object?” 

“So that we may closely question 
those whom the Imaiz may have 
trained or influenced. They may tell 
us much about Dion, his objectives 
and his facilities. When we’ve 
finished we have the legal right to 
do with them whatever the evidence 
suggests. We should at least find 



the men behind the warehouse 
sabotage. Possibly we’ll fihd many 
more who’ve not yet had the time to 
make a move against us.” 

Catuul’s eyes shone with com- 
prehension. “It’s a good plan, 
friend Tito. I don’t anticipate much 
difficulty about copying the auc- 
tioneers’ records. It’s frequently 
done by those comparing slave 
stock for breeding purposes.” 

“Then the matter is settled,” said 
Ren. “When the director gets back 
he’s going to expect us to have some 
pretty damaging ammunition 
aimed at the Imaiz. He’s not going 
to be too happy about the loss of 
the warehouse. Some of the es- 
sential oils in it were priceless by 
any standards. From this point on 
we’re very much at war with the 
Imaiz.” 

V 

V ESTEVAAL, on his return, 
was much perturbed that the 
Imaiz had struck the first damaging 
blow in a fight essentially started by 
Ren. To cover himself Ren outlined 
his policy for evaluating the slaves 
and isolating those who had been 
under the Imaiz’s influence. 
Vestevaal was impressed by the de- 
tail, but pointed out that the action 
was purely defensive. Wars were 
not won by orderly retreats. 

The merchant worlds of Combien 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



33 




and Ranee had firmly stressed to 
Vestevaal the importance of An- 
haritte as a freeport and had 
backed their stand by donating the 
battle cruiser now at the spaceport. 
The Freetrade Security Council 
had been just as vociferous and 
had not only pledged unlimited fi- 
nancial backing, but had insisted on 
sending a professional trouble- 
shooter, Dr. Alek Hardun, as a 
technical backup for Ren’s team. 
Implicit in this latter action was the 
threat that if Ren did not make a 
success of defeating the Imaiz, the 
merchant worlds and the Freetrade 
Council were quite prepared to 
move in a stronger cadre to settle 
the question. 

“Nevertheless,” said Ren, “if 
we’re to retain the cooperation of 
the societies, we must first observe 
the principle of harassment and 
feud. To attempt outright war on 
the Imaiz at this stage could set 
even the societies against us, be- 
cause we’re outworlders and they’re 
indigenous. I know all the argu- 
ments, but if we turn public opinion 
against us the planetary 
government will have to act — and 
we’ll have lost the freeport 
anyway.” 

“Well, it’s still your show, Tito. 
But let’s see some positive action 
against the Imaiz. I want to see him 
hit where it hurts and not only for 
my personal satisfaction. I have to 



make reports back to the Freetrade 
Council. I never was much good at 
making negative reports.” 

“Then how about this for an 

opener? We intend to contest 

Zinder’s bondship with Dion- 

daizan.” 

Vestevaal swung around 

abruptly. 

“Damn!” he said. “That would 
certainly make Dion sit up. How 
would you set about it?” 

Ren smiled wolfishly. “All 
bondships have to be registered at 
the prefecture — and that’s the only 
official record. If anything hap- 
pened to the entry regarding the 
bondship of Zinder to Dion-daizan 
the Imaiz would have no legal way 
of proving his ownership.” 

“And it can be arranged that 
something will happen to the 
entry?” 

“The register clerk is a minor 
member of the Society of Pointed 
Tails.” 

“Surely it isn’t as simple as that.” 
“No. In normal circumstances 
the loss of the entry would not af- 
fect the position, because the rights 
of ownership of the bond would not 
be contested. But in this case the 
ownership will be called into 
question by the Pointed Tails acting 
on your behalf. As prefect. Lord Di 
Irons won’t be very happy about 
the situation, but in order to uphold 
the law he’ll have to impound 



34 



IF 




Zinder until the matter is settled. 
That leaves Dion-daizan with two 
courses of action. He can take the 
case to the supreme court in 
Gaillen — where he would win, of 
course, except that the litigation 
could take a year — ” 

“Or?” 

“He could take the quicker 
course of accepting the fact that he 
has no provable right to Zinder's 
bond. In that case binder would be 
put into the slave market, from 
which Dion-daizan could hope to 
buy her back.” 

“As a very rich man he should 
have no trouble on that score,” said 
Vestevaal dubiously. 

“No. But it’s an open market. 
Anyone can bid who’s entitled to 
hold a slave-bond. That rules you 
out as a direct participant, but ijt 
doesn’t stop the Pointed Tails from 
acting on your behalf. If we bid 
against Dion, using our backing 
from the Galactic Bank as gua- 
rantee, we could force up the price 
to where even Dion’s resources 
would be strained. We could make 
him cripple himself financially in 
order to save her.” \ 

The director smote his^knee in 
lusty approval. 

“You know, Tito, you’ve some- 
thing of a genius for this sort of 
thing. Keep up this level of 
skulduggery and we’ll see you on 
the Freetrade Council yet.” 



H eartened, Ren stroUed 
down to the lodge of the 
Pointed Tails. The place always im- 
pressed and fascinated him. Here 
the ancient Ahhn customs and ar- 
chitecture had been carefully 
preserved from outworld in- 
fluences. The walls and ceilings of 
the lodge were ornamented with red 
and gold reliefs showing stylized 
pictures of legendary battles, with 
captions worded in the original but 
now lapsed High-Ahhn cuneiform 
script. The whole establishment 
was richly carpeted, hung with re- 
markably descriptive tapestries and 
scented with delicate fragrances. It 
was the closest the Ahhn had ever 
come to creating a temple. In its 
halls the history of a proud and in- 
telligent race was set out to show its 
richness and cohesion and a depth 
of culture that could have been the 
envy of many older civilizations. 

Catuul Gras seemed to be 
expecting him and Ren was not sur- 
prised. He knew the intimate web 
of observation and communication 
with which the societies laced the 
city. 

“Docs the director approve of the 
plan to contest Zinder’s bond?” 
Catuul asked. 

“He does. We’re to proceed as 
planned. I think we’d best make our 
move this afternoon, in case some 
suspicion of what we' intend leaks 
back tothe/ma/z.” 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE

''I agree, friend Tito. Speed and 
secrecy arc essential. We will watch 
for Zinder to come to the fruit 
market today. As soon as Fm sure 
she’s there I’ll have my colleague. 
Mallow Rade, lay formal com- 
plaint at the prefecture and demand 
her impoundment.” 
r“And the entry in the register?” 
“That’s already taken care of. 
The matter only waits for us to 
draw it to the prefect’s attention. 
But news travels with the flics in 
Anharitte. I suggest neither you nor 
your director show yourselves out- 
side your chambers until the 
watchmen have aixested her. I hope 
the prefect will have enough sense 
to bring sufficient men to prevent 
any trouble. As the director’s agent, 
it will be necessary for you to be 
present at the formal discussion of 
the case afterward. It might be 
safer if the director didn’t expose 
himself at all for a day or two.” 

“I doubt he’ll agree,” said Ren. 
“But I’ll try to get the point over to 
him. How’s the work going on 
collecting information for pre- 
paring histories on the slaves?” 
“Slowly. As fast as we get the 
lists complete we’re sending them 
by runner to Dr. Hardun at the 
spaceport.” 

“Good. Have we any results as 
yet?” 

“Most interestingly, yes. We 
can’t produce the histories until all 



the copying is complete, but al- 
ready a pattern is starting to 
emerge. The Imaiz buys and sells 
many slaves in an apparently 
random fashion. But Dr. Hardun’s 
pointed out that there’s a system 
behind it.” 

“Oh? What sort of system?” Ren 
was immediately attentive. 

“Dion-daizan has an ar- 
rangement with the slave auc- 
tioneers whereby he’s notified when 
a new batch of slaves is available. 
He sends his steward to make a pre- 
liminary viewing, then bids heavily 
for those he chooses.” 

“Which is surely a reasonable 
practice?” 

“Yes, except that he purchases 
many times his normal labor re- 
quirement. All but a few of these he 
shortly returns to the market for 
resale.” 

“And presumably makes a profit 
on the deal.” 

Catuul shook his head. “No. The 
significant thing is that he usually 
takes a loss because he outbid the 
market in the first place.” 

“I don’t see — ” Ren’s voice car- 
ried a note of puzzlement. “Then, 
assuming he’s no philanthropist, 
the value of the transactions must 
lie uniquely in the few he doesn’t 
return for sale.” 

Catuul nodded. “The only infor- 
mation we could gain about them 
was obtained by questioning the 



36 



IF 




ones he rejected. It appears that all 
the slaves he purchases are given a 
very thorough medical checkup and 
put through a series of tests.'" 

“What sort of tests?” 

“I think you outworlders describe 
them as intelligence and aptitude 
tests. The few who pass remain with 
the Imaiz, The failures are returned 
to the market.” 

“So that Dion-daizan is 
cultivating a select group of in- 
telligent, capable and healthy 
slaves?” 

“Presumably. But it’s interesting 
to guess at the standards he’s 
working toward. Dr. Hardun 
examined the best of the latest 
batch the Imaiz had offered for 
resale. Sonie of Dion’s rejects were 
not only above average intelligence 
and fitness for the slave caste — they 
were also above average for citizens 
of any class.” 

Ren’s scowl caused his eyebrows 
to meet. “So Dion’s not only 
building a select group of slaves, 
he’s x;ulling an elite. Zinder’s no 
happy accident. Nor is she likely to 
be unique. Damn — how long has 
this been going on, Catuul?” 

“Certainly for ten years, 
probably longer. I suppose at least 
seventy per cent of marketable 
slaves in Anharitte have been 
through his hands at some time or 
another. And he also buys some in 
the provinces.”

“And pure-bred Ahhn stock is 
renowned for its high intelligence. 
Dion’s probably acquired a concen- 
tration of brains in Nfagda that is 
unique on Roget — perhaps unique 
on any of the known worlds. Can 
you arrange that only low-grade 
slaves are offered to Dion in 
future?” 

“I’ll do what I can. With most 
auctioneers a little pressure will do 
the trick. The ones swe can’t in- 
fluence are those the Pointed Tails 
themselves are duty-bound to 
protect. We can’t hurt one of our 
own clients for the beneflt of 
another.” 

“Then tell them frankly what we

think the Imaiz is about. Ask for 
their cooperation. It’s in their 
interests to work with us because if 
the Imaiz wins, the slave trade 
dies.” 

“It might work with some,” said 
Catuul dubiously. “But others 
make much money out of the 
Imaiz, There will be many who 
won’t want to offend him and who 
will be suspicious of your motives.”

R en stayed at the window of his 
.. office chambers all that af- 
ternoon. Zinder was late arriving. 
Finally, however, her dark hair and 
proud bearing made her as ap- 
parent in the crowd as a lantern in 
the darkness. Even the excellence of 
her flowing gown set her as a 
woman apart and made her im- 
possible to miss. Attuned as he was 
to the pattern of undercurrents in 
the populace, Ren could sense a 
tension in the market, as though 
some suspicion of what was to take 
place had already passed as rumor. 

Vestevaal frett^ in a chair be- 
hind him. A man of direct action, 
he had no use for patient ob- 
servation from behind half-drawn 
curtains, nor did he accept the prin- 
ciple that feud and harassment were 
necessary preliminaries to des- 
troying an enemy. Nevertheless he 
obeyed Ren’s insistence that he 



confine himself indoors at least 
until after Zinder’s arrest. He 
amused himself by interrogating 
the spaceport computer complex 
from Ren’s line-fed office terminal 
and inspecting the agency accounts 
in the minutest detail. 

' When the watchmen arrived Ren 
saw the tension visibly rise in the 
market. As they moved in the di- 
rection of Zinder the scene became 
tinged with menace almost to the 
point of open resistance. But Di 
irons knew his trade. As the ar- 
resting officers moved to take the 
slave girl a second force of 
watchmen deployed through the 
crowd ready to nip in the bud any 
pockets of disobedience. Even so 
the resentment was building to 
crisis proportions and some slight 
catalyst could easily have tipped the 
balance into violence. Ren under- 
stood now Catuul’s insistence that 
Vestevaal should not be present 
when the arrest took place. 

Jt was Zinder herself, however, 
who averted the dangerous phase. 
She shrugged amusedly at the 
watchmen’s advance, then turned 
and addressed herself to the crowd. 
Ren could not hear what she said, 
but he was certain from the at- 
tention she was receiving that she 
was completely in control of the 
situation. She calmed and pacified 
the group around her and told it 
something that proved such a huge 



38 



IF 




joke that those nearest to her broke 
away laughing and went to retell it 
to others/ 

Prefect Di Irons thrust his way 
through and spoke to her. Again 
she laughed, and even he came out 
of the encounter with a reluctant 
smile curling the corners of his de- 
termined mouth. Then Zinder 
allowed herself to be escorted away. 
None of the watchmen touched her. 
They formed a double rank and 
she, obligingly, walked between 
them, moving off in the direction of 
the prefecture. The marketplace re- 
laxed, yet returned not to trade but 
rather to heated and speculative 
conversation. Di Irons and the 
watchmen stood stolidly watchful 
for any hotheads who might try to 
rekindle hostility. 

When Catuul Gras came up, Ren 
met him at the door. 

“I think it’s safe now, friend Tito. 
I have men enough to cover you to 
the prefecture. The hearing will 
take place as soon as Dion-daizan 
can get a spokesman there. Zinder 
has predicted to the crowd that the 
Imaiz will teach the director a great 
lesson. I must speak with him at 
once.” 

“He’s inside,” said Ren. 

“Good. You go along to the 
prefecture. I’ll follow as soon as I 
can.” 

Ren buckled on his sword and 
carefully checked the readiness of 



the blaster which he wore concealed 
beneath his shirt. Warily he moved 
out into the square. Surprisingly, 
nobody seemed to pay him much 
attention. This was now the battle 
of the giants, the Imaiz versus 
Vestevaal. Ren was merely a bit- 
player and not a main participant 
at all. 

As he passed out of the square a 
sudden grip on his arm made Ren 
swing round. He found himself face 
to face with the prefect. 

“Agent Ren, I’m not deceived. I 
can read your hand behind this little 
charade. I don’t know what you 
hope to gain by antagonizing the 
Imaiz, but let me repeat my 
warning. Dion is more camming than 
you’ll allow. Twist his tail too often 
and he’ll break you into a thousand 
parts. And if your machinations 
cause public trouble in Anharitte — 
I’ll break you myself. I hope I 
make myself understood?” 

“Perfectly,” said Ren. “But I pay 
well for the best available advisers 
and they guarantee we’re engaged 
in nothing contrary to the law. I 
take it we’ve a perfect right to re- 
quest that Zinder be impounded 
pending a legal enquiry?” 

“You have that right through a 
society,” agreed Di Irons, “But I 
would not have thought you well 
advised to exercise it. The loss of 
the register entry is in itself suspect. 
I am now looking for a despoiler of 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



39 




prefecture records — and Dion- 

daizan will be looking for blood. I 
suspect that if 1 delay my inquiries 
a little my problem will be 
answered for me. Be very cautious, 
Ren. You’ve chosen a dai^erous 
adversary.” 

T ' HE prefect moved away. Now 
that Zinder had actually been 
removed to the prefecture, the 
whole area had assumed an at- 
mosphere of disturbed indignation 
that seemed unlikely to flare more 
violently. However, it was obvious 
that only the presence of so many 
watchmen had prevented a riot and 
open interference with the arrest. 
Ren understood how perilously 
close the incident had been to 
causing a breach of the peace and 
he saw that in this the Imaiz had a 
powerful weapon he" could use 
against the Pointed Tails. By 
creating a public outcry at a similar 
maneuver he could easily throw 
the blame back on to the society 
and its employer as the prime 
sources of public unrest. 

Ren’s ^rival at the prefecture 
was just in time for him to witness 
the lodging of an ofFicial notice 
contesting the Imaiz s ownership of 
Zinder by Mallow Rade, a junior 
scribe of the Pointed Tails. When 
the paper had been recorded Di 
Irons, whose mood seemed to be 



one of thunder, called formally for 
a spokesman from the House of 
Magda to pose a rebuttal. 

For a long time nobody moved. 
Then, from the back of the crowd, a 
young slave pushed his way forward 
and presented his stewardship cre- 
dentials to Di Irons. 

“Ah, Barii.” Di Irons seemed 
slightly relieved. “Do you know 
how Dion-daizan wishes to proceed 
in this matter?” 

Barii, Who bore his slave mark, 
together with the house symbol of 
Magda, like a proud badge on his 
naked arms, nodded. Ren was 
watching the youth intently, noting 
the same quiet confidence in the 
boy he had recognized in Zinder. 
Here was both an intelligence and a 
competence that had no place in the 
slave. 

“May I see the register from 
which Dion’s title is missing?”— 

Di Irons brought out the volume 
and opened it to the disputed page, 
exposing the rows of names 
scrawled painfully in a large and al- 
most illegible script. One of the 
entries had clearly been overwritten 
at a later date. There was no doubt 
that the alteration had been de- 
liberate. 

Barii reached into his pouch and 
drew out some article the purpose 
of which was not plain until the 
unexpected brilliance of an 
electronic flash glared back from 



40 



IF 




the yellowing pages. A second flash 
illuminated the startled face of the 
register clerk. Barii put his camera 
back into its pouch and bowed to Di 
Irons. If his fa<^ held any 
expression at all it was one of 
concealed amusement and antici- 
pation. 

Then Ba^ii spoke. 

“Dion-daizan has noted the ob- 
jections to his ownership of 
Zinder’s bond. Everyone in An- 
haritte knows that Zinder’s 
preeminence is largely due to her 
association with the House of 
Magda — thus there can be no doubt 
of the true tenure of her bond. 
However, the Imaiz is immensely 
concerned about the maintenance 
of the law on the three hills. In con- 
sequence he has directed that, since 
no clear title to his ownership seems 
to be recorded in the prefecture, he 
will renounce his claim to being 
Zinder’s legal bondholder. He re- 
quests that the slave in question be 
put to public auction and that the 
proceeds of the sale be dedicated to 
the public funds of the city, as is the 
custom.” 

Di Irons had listened to this 
speech with growing disbelief. He 
seemed about to throw in some 
crushing protest, but was stopped 
by something he saw in Barii’s face. 
The prefect’s shrug was massive 
and uncomprehending. 

“So be it,” he said. “It’s the con- 



sidered opinion of the prefecture 
that th6 bondship of Zinder has no 
clear tenure. The slave woman 
called Zinder wiB therefore be 
returned to the market and submit- 
ted to public auction. Let it be 
known that anyone desirous of ob- 
taining this property may attend 
tomorrow at the preset hour and 
bid legal coinage for unrestricted 
bond rights. The matter is now dis- 
missed from these courts.” 

Ren’s attentive eyes fell upon the 
register clerk, whose hands had un- 
doubtedly been responsible for the 
alteration of the entry. The clerk 
seemed relieved that Di Irons had 
so easily acceded to the contesting 
of the records, yet his nervous 
glances at Barii showed that he 
knew retribution was still due. The 
steward’s act of photographing the 
entry had shaken him badly and his 
ashen hue was indicative of a deep 
and mortal fear. Knowing of the 
clerk’s association with the Pointed 
Tails,, Ren was pleased to note that 
members of the clan moved protec- 
tively nearer to the clerk to guard 
him against danger. 

Di Irons was looking at his 
treacherous clerk with something 
akin to murder in his eyes. His 
sword hand convulsively gripped 
the hilt of his weapon. For a 
moment Ren thought that Di Irons 
was going to attack the fellow, but 
Barii moved between them and a

slight lift of his eyebrows caused the 
prefect to relax. 

Ren relaxed too. 

All Anharitte was watching the 
outcome of this dispute — the sup- 
posed omnipotence on the Imaiz 
Was now on public trial. Dion- 
daizan’s easy acquiescence to the 
challenge might mean only that he 
had chosen the slave market as the 
quicker route for regaining Zinder’s 
bond, but currently the wizard’s 
public image must have suffered a 
lowering as a result of Ren’s auda- 
cious move. Ren had well prepared 
the ground ahead. It was going to 
be an interesting battle. 



R en awoke in the night with a 
start. A house servant was 
shaking his arm. 

“Agent Ren — wake up, please! 
The prefect sends for you ur- 
gently.’’ 

Shaking the sleep from his head, 
Ren roused himself and forced his 
mind to concentrate. 

“What did you say?” 

“The prefect sends watchmen to 
guide you. The register clerk is 
dead.” 

“Damn!” said Ren, struggling 
into his clothes. “What has it to do 
with me?” 

He went downstairs to re- 
monstrate with the watchmen who 
waited in the downstairs office. The 



sergeant listened to his protest 
without expression. 

“The Lord Di Irons is aware of 
your position. Nonetheless he 
directs we conduct you to the place 
of the accident.” 

“Accident?” 

The sergeant refused to be drawn 
out. “Come, Agent Ren. Lord Di 
Irons himself will explain the mat- 
ter.” 

Ren reached for his cloak, girded 
on his sword and reluctantly 
followed the watchmen into the 
night. 

The air outside was chill and 
damp with the clinging mists from 
the sea. The whole township was in 
darkness save for the occasional 
flare of the watch braziers and the 
torches carried by his escort. The 
sudden transition from sleep to the 
cold darkness and the leaping 
flames of the brands touched the 
scene with unreality made only 
more credible by the hardness of 
the shifting, round cobbles 
underneath his feet. 

The route the watchmen chose 
was unfamiliar to Ren, involving 
numerous turns down narrow 
streets and alleys until his whole 
sense of direction was destroyed. 
Finally the party halted in front of a 
mean drinking place and Ren 
waited impatiehtly while the 
watchmen knocked on a small ai^d 
unfamiliar door. Shortly, bolts 



42 



IF 




were drawn and the great bulk of Di 
Irons himself loomed between the 
door posts. 

“Ah, Ren. Come in. You’re an 
astute man, so I’m going to give 
you an opportunity to exercise your 
cleverness.” 

The prefect leaned past Ren and 
instructed the watchmen to 
continue searching the area. Then 
he withdrew into the room and 
beckoned to Ren. The doorway was 
so small that even Ren had to duck 
his head as he entered. The ceiling 
inside was scarcely higher and the 
room stank of cheap alcohol and 
the presence of too many bodies. 
Ten of th^ Pointed Tails, Catuul 
Gras among them, sat in a circle 
around a flickering lamp, looking 
uneasify at Di Irons. On the far side 
of the room another door led out to 
a small bricked courtyard, which 
two watchmen illuminated with 
poled lanterns. Across the thresh- 
old of this second door lay the 
register clerk. He had a fatal wound 
in this throat and blood spread wide 
across the floor. 

Di Irons was crushing. “I lay the 
responsibility for this piece of mis- 
chief at your door, Ren.” 

The statement caught Ren com- 
pletely off guard. 

“Mine?” 

“Of course.” 

“But I had nothing whatever to 
do with his death.” 



“Then you should consider better 
the consequences of your actions. I 
know perfectly well that this man 
overwrote Dion-daizan’s title in the 
register and I know that your 
money induced him to do it. Now 
he’s dead because of it. If this piece 
of bloodshed is an example of how 
you mean to harass the Imaiz you’d 
be well advised to employ a more 
competent society.” He spat in the 
general direction of Catuul Gras. 

“I admit I could have been an 
interested party,” said Ren. But if 
the man’s dead it was the Imaiz, 
who had him killed. Why don’t you 
tax him with it?” 

“I would — if I had a shred of 
proof. But we’ve found po trace of 
an assassin, no sign of any weapon. 
It’s only our suspicion that the 
Imaiz would want this man 
destroyed. There’s no tangible con- 
nection with Dion-daizan. If you 
can give me proof of his complicity. 
I’ll take the issue to his door. Until 
then I regard this as the result of 
your own inept machinations.” 

“You’ve found no weapon?” Ren 
was perplexed. He turned to Catuul 
Gras. “Weren’t you here when it 
happened?” 

“I was — we all were.” Catuul’s 
gesture encompassed his comrades. 
“We chose this house because it has 
only one door connecting with the 
street — and that door could be 
stoutly bolted. The windows have 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



43 




shutters inside and the courtyard 
leads only to blank walls. Here, at 
least, we thought we could defend 
him from the mighty wrath of the 
Imaiz/* 

“Then what happened?” Ren was 
impatient. 

“We were drinking moderately 
and talking and because the roof is 
low the room soon grew hot. We 
opened the door to the courtyard to 
let in air, since we dared not unbar 
the windows. Even then, for safety’s 
sake, we put three men in the court- 
yard so that no 'surprise attack 
could come from there.” 

“And?” 

“The clerk was badly worried 
and drank more freely than was 
wise. Knowing the courtyard was 
guarded, he felt safe in going to the 
door to relieve himself into the 
gully. As he reached the door he 
seemed to choke and we saw him 
fall down just where you see him 
how. His throat was torn and he 
drowned in his own blood.” 

“Then how did — ?” 

“We don’t know. Those in the 
courtyard saw and heard nothing, 
nor did those of us who stayed in- 
side. Whatever split his throat has 
not been found, though we’ve 
searched the yard and the room a 
dozen times. No man among us has 
recent blood on his weapons, so 
even treachery is ruled out. I per- 
sonally think that the Imaiz sent an 



invisible beast to claw out his 
throat.” 

“You know I can’t accept that,” 
said Ren angrily. “There are no 
such things as invisible beasts.” 

R en bent down to examine the 
. wound, but realized, with his 
Fingers and shoes slipping with 
blood, that he had neither the 
knowledge nor the stomach to gain 
much from the examination. H^ 
passed on out into the courtyard, 
inspected its solid walls and tried to 
scrutinize the higher surroundings, 
which were obscured by darkness. 
Finding no solution to the mystery, 
he climbed back past the body in 
the doorway and faced Di Irons. 

“If you’ll permit. Prefect, I’d like 
Dr. Hardun at the spaceport to per- 
form an examination of the body.” 
“Will that help. Agent Ren? The 
man is dead — his throat is gone. 
What more can be learned from 
him?” 

“There must be some evidence of 
whatever broke his throat. We’ve 
many facilities on the battle cruiser. 
A weapon that caused that damage 
must have left a trace. If it’s there 
we’ll find it.” 

The prefect shrugged. “I see no 
harm in your trying. If you wish 
you may come and take the body 
after daybreak. And you, Catuul, 
will have an accounting to make 
with his widow. I shall hold the'

Pointed Tails responsible for the 
cremation and all expenses. No- 
body's lightly going to disturb the 
peace while I’m prefect on the three 
hills. 

“It will be as you direct, 
Prefect,” said Catuul Gras quietly, 
though a variety of emotions strug- 
gled in his voice. 

The prefect called his watchmen 
and departed. Ren turned to Catuul 
in anger. 

“The fate of the clerk is unfortu- 
nate, but I thought your society 
could have handled a thing like the 
death of a member with discretion. 
How did Di Irons come to learn of 
it?” 

“I asked myself the same thing,” 
said Catuul. “The watchmen claim 
they were called here because of 
complaints of a disturbance. But 
there was no disturbance. When the 
man fell dead we were too amazed 
to cry out — and thereafter we were 
too afraid of attracting attention. 
Yet the watchmen arrived within 
minutes of the death. Indeed, they 
must have started on their way 
while the man was still alive. 
Whoever complained to them must 
have done so with a foreknowledge 
of the death to come.” 

“Di Irons seems reluctant to 
agree that the Imaiz must have 
been responsible. Does he have 
some sympathy for Dion-daizan?” 

“I think not. Di Irons concerns 



himself with the peace of the city. If 
two sides feud he cares little which 
side goes under — as long as the 
fighting is contained. Knowing this, 
Dion is perhaps using him to harass 
us like fools. I swear to you one 
thing, friend Tito — if Dion-daizan 
hopes to buy Zinder back at the 
auction he’ll find her the most ex- 
pensive purchase he has ever at- 
tempted.” 

VII 

T he slave market was situated 
on the eastern slopes of An- 
haritte, in the bowl through which 
descended the old road leading to 
the valley and to Secondhill and 
T’ Ampere. The location was said to 
have been chosen in the days when 
slaves were leased to merchant 
vessels entering the shipping lanes 
to trade their cargoes along the in- 
land rivers and canals. The slaves 
were used to handle the cargo ex- 
changes and in theory returned 
to their owners when the ships once 
again reached the Aprillo en route 
to the sea. 

However, so many slaves were 
lost through misuse by their tempo- 
rary masters that the system fell 
into disrepute and slave-leases were 
abandoned. 

It was doubtful if a more astute 
class of man existed on all the three 
hills than the average slave auc-

tioneer. Operating usually on a 
percentage basis against the immu- 
table laws of supply and demand, 
he knew well how to present his 
wares to the best advantage and 
how to drive the shrewdest bargain. 

This afternoon, however, most of 
the sale rostrums were unattended 
by clients, no matter how elo- 
quently the vendors phrased their 
sales address. A curious order had 
replaced the normal hubbub of the 
slave market and almost all the 
onlookers were facing a solitary 
platform high on the slope. 
Watchmen were in Abundance, as if 
to emphasize the weight of the hand 
of the law, but the crowd was 
genuinely good humored and 
interested in the coming spectacle. 
The atmosphere was one of antici- 
pation rather than resentment. The 
occasion was the sale of Zinder's 
bond — and speculation had it that 
the Imaiz himself would be coming 
to the bidding. 

Ren had arrived early with 
Catuul Gras and a more than 
nominal bodyguard of Pointed 
Tails. They first approached the 
auctioneer to establish CatnuPs 
right to bid on behalf of Magno Ve- 
stevaal and to offer proof of the 
considerable funding on which they 
could draw if necessity arose. Then, 
under the jovial eyes of the happy 
auctioneer, they were offered 
selected seating in front of the ros- 



trum from which to conduct their 
business. At a few minutes to the 
preset hour at which the 
proceedings should have begun 
there was still no sign of anyone 
from the House of Magda. Then 
the crowd divided abruptly and a 
man strode through alone — Dion- 
daizan, the wizard of Anharitte. 

This was the first time that Tito 
Ren had ever been really close to 
the Imaiz and he studied Dion care- 
fully as the latter spoke to the auc- 
tioneer in the customary mode of 
introduction. Ren’s analysis did not 
leave him particularly impressed. 
Of indeterminate age, though 
probably nearing fifty years, Dion 
appeared to eschew all forms of 
shawmanship or affectation. 

-Qad in a simple white gown, 
without apparent weapons, Dion’s 
face was neither distinguished nor 
particularly memorable. Only the 
movement of his hands indicated 
quiet confidence and competence 
that warned the agent to be wary. 
Whether or not the man was a Ter- 

ran was not discernible from his 

/ 

unexceptional appearance, but he 
was obviously skilled in the control 
both of himself and others. And 
from the respect with which he was 
treated it was obvious that he was 
nearly a god in the eyes of An- 
haritte. 

The auctioneer held up his hands 
for attention, His prologue was 



46 



IF 




treated to a quantity of good-na- 
tured banter from the onlooking 
assembly, but this died when Zinder 
herself was brought out. 

Ren was stunned. He had seen 
the work of beauticians on seven 
prime worlds, but never in all his 
experience had he seen such exqui- 
site presentation of the female form 
as Zinder managed on her way to 
the rostrum. The audience of 
perhaps a thousand held its breath 
as she walked on stage in burnished 
radiance. Only Dio;i himself 
seemed unimpressed. 

Even the auctioneer became 
speechless. Though he had issued 
instructions that Zinder be readied 
for the market, he had not an- 
ticipated the skill in the hands of 
several inhabitants of Magda whose 
task it had somehow become. He 
started to make his customary ap- 
peal to would-be purchasers, but 
seemed to becoitie awed by the 
wonder 6f it all. Evidently lost for 
words, he Tinally paid her the ulti- 
mate tribute — he kneeled and 
kissed her hand. 

A cheer rose from the assembly. 



C ATUUL GRAS came coldly 
to his feet. “I bid you five barr 
for the bond,” he said. 

So low a price was a calculated 
insult. The audience tensed with an- 



ticipation. It was going to be an 
evening to remember. 

^Raised to the second power,” 
said Dion-daizan unhurriedly. 

“Six barr to the second power,” 
said Catuul Gras. He was playing 
his hand narrowly. 

“To the third power,” said Dion- 
daizan. 

“Seven to the third power,” 
Catuul said. 

Ren, whose mathematical 
training probably transcended that 
of any in the Avatching public, 
lapsed into mental calculation of 
the true value of the bids, unsettled 
by the way in which the Imaiz each 
time multiplied the value of the bid 
by raising the index. It was abso- 
lutely certain that at some point 
the Imaiz was going to ap- 
proach a figure he could not 
possibly afford, and at that point 
Catull must withdraw. He was 
relieved to note that, as the values 
rose, the scribe became more 
punctilious about, obtaining confir- 
mation before proceeding. 

Nevertheless, Ren continued dis- 
concerted by the actions of the 
Imaiz, who seemed determined to 
drive the price into truly as- 
tronomical figures. 

It said much for the mental con- 
stitution of the auctioneer that he 
was able to continue functioning as 
evenly as he did in the face of the 
rapidly mounting values. He was 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



47 




sweating profusely and developed a 
marked tremor of the limbs when 
his due commission on the sale 
would have made him rich beyond 
all his dreams. Still the contest 
continued. 

Ren was now using a pocket cal- 
culator to bring out the absolute va- 
lues of the bids in terms of the ga- 
lactic credits. The Imaiz used no 
calculating aids, but Ren had the 
feeling that Dion-daizan was 
nevertheless completely aware of 
the real value of the figures with 
which they were playing. Only 
Catuul seemed out of his depth and 
repeatedly looked at Ren for con- 
firmation that he was intended to 
continue. 

“Ten barrs raised to the sixth 
power, “ said Catuul uneasily. This 
was more money than he had ever 
heard of. 

“Ten to the seventh power.” 
Dion-daizan showed slight signs of 
agitation although Ren suspected 
the wizard was well within his 
ample budget. 

“Eleven to the seventh.” 

The Imaiz faltered and a gasp of 
anticipation ran through the 
watching crowd. Ren felt a savage 
elation at the thought of having 
placed the Imaiz on public trial. It 
was a beautiful piece of 
harassnient. 

“Eleven barrs to the eighth 
power,” said the Imaiz finally. 



Somebody in the crowd with 
some appreciation of the amount 
involved gave him a round of ap- 
plause. Ren signaled for Catuul to 
continue. 

“Twelve to the eighth,” said 
Catuul grimly. 

The Imaiz stopped and scanned 
the crowd, as if trying to estimate 
the cost of losing face. Then he 
shrugged resignedly and turned 
again to the auctioneer. Ren still 
judged Dion-daizan to be within the 
limits of his purse, but the wizard 
was obviously struggling with con- 
siderations that evidently weighed 
as heavily with him as the regainings 
of Zinder. 

“Twelve to the ninth,” said the 
master of Magda in a voice that 
could scarcely heard. 

Catuul Gras stole a warning look 
at Ren, but the agent had a 
reasonable idea of the Imaiz* s true 
flnancial potential, based on the 
yearly spaceport dues paid to the 
House of Magda. He knew it was 
possible to squeeze the Imaiz even 
drier. 

“Thirteen to the ninth,” said 
Catuul. 

“Thirteen to the tenth,” said the 
Imaiz, his voice suddenly sharp 
with a new resolve. 

“What’s the old fox up to?” 
asked Catuul anxiously. “Has he 
really got that much money?” 

“I think he has. But he’s be- 



48 



IF 




coming uncomfortable. I think just 
once more must take him to the 
limit.” 

“Fourteen to the tenth,” said 
Catuul. 

The auctioneer had long since 
ceased to comprehend the magni- 
tude of the figures being used and 
cared only that each bid was higher 
than the last. On a commission of 
even one per cent his family would 
be rich for generations. 

Dion-daizan sat, his face sud- 
denly bland. The auctioneer looked 
at him questioningly. 

“Dion — don’t you wish to raise?” 

“Of course not.” The Imaiz’s 
faice was alive with humor, re- 
vealing a richness of personality he 
had hitherto concealed. “Believe 
me, it’s not through lack of finance, 
but in observance of a principle.” 

“Prmciple?” The auctioneer was 
lost. 

“Yes,” said Dion-daizan happily. 
“Anyone who would bid fourteen to 
the tenth power barrs for Zinder 
musit Jiave achieved a true ap- 
preciation of her worth. Far be it 
for me to det^r such enlightenment. 
It’s not every day that my 
progressive policies gain such 
eminent recognition. Nor is it often 
in Anharitte that the real worth of a 
human being is so openly ac- 
knowledged. May others soon be- 
come as wise as Director Veste- 
vaal.” 



R en watched with mounting 
> horror as the hammer fell. The 
auctioneer’s voice boomed above 
the murmur of the crowd. 

“I hereby declare the slave 
Zinder to be sold to the Society of 
Pointed Tails acting on behalf of its 
client. Director Magno Vestevaal. 
The agreed price is fourteen barrs 
raised to the tenth power — a com- 
pletely unprecedented sum for any 
slave at any time in history and a 
truly magnificent tribute to the 
slave-training policy of the House 
of Magda.” 

“Damn!” Ren, ashen of face, 
staggered to his feet. It was too late 
to rescind the bid — ^the transaction 
was already complete. He turned 
appealingly to Catuul Gras. 

“What the hell’s Dion up to?” 
“Teaching the director a lesson, I 
should think,” said Catuul grimly. 
“Well he’s certainly made his 
point — and at our expense. Let’s 
face it, Tito. He’s beaten us at our 
own game.” 

“I don’t believe it,” said Ren, 
consumed by his own anger. “A 
man like Dion isn’t going to let 
Zinder go.” 

Zinder, from the rostrum, had 
displayed a keen interest in the 
proceedings. Far from seeming bet- 
rayed by Dion-daizan’s action, she 
appeared elated. She saluted her 
late master who, in turn, ap- 
proached her to kiss her hand. Then 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



49 




Dion-daizan turned to the crowd 
and raised his hands in an expansive 
gesture of triumph. The ensuing 
cheer was probably the loudest ^oar 
of acclamation from human throats 
that Roget had ever known. 

The auctioneer took Zinder’s 
halter and led her, a symbol of ap- 
parent meekness, to Catuul Gras. 
The latter took the plaited rope as 
though it were likely to grow hot 
and looked somewhat stupidly at 
Ren. 

“The sale price is on guarantee 
from the Galactic Bank,” said the 
auctioneer. “The contract set- 
tlement is now between the 
purchaser and the city adminis- 
tration. Therefore I have no need to 
detain you, except to remind you of 
the convention that the title of the 
bond 'must be registered at the 
prefecture by within seven hours or 
the money is forfeit and the bond is 
returned to the city adminis- 
tration.” 

“I understand,” said Catuul 
Gras. “I assure you the bond will be 
duly registered within the time.” 

Ren said nothing, not being able 
to trust himself to speak. Having 
been tricked into authorizing such 
an astronomical sum on the acqui- 
sition of a single female slave, he 
knew that the blackest hour of his 
career was upon him. An error in 
his judgment had caused this em- 
barrassment to happen. He had 



been certain above all things that 
the Imaiz would not allow Zinder 
to be bought over his head. Now 
the wizard was standing both 
pleased and apparently unworried 
as Zinder was led away by the 
hands of his sworn enemies. Ren 
was still not convinced that the 
Imaiz would allow it to happen, but 
failed to see how he could, prevent 
it — unless by some ambush or de- 
ception Dion managed to stop the 
bond’s being registered in time. 

Catuul’s mind was apparently 
working along the same lines. He 
signaled members of his clan out 
from the crowd and ' sent them 
ahead to see that the roads Zinder 
and her new owners had to travel 
were free from possible trouble. 
With practiced inconspicuousness 
the little group melted away. 

“I think,” said Catuul, “that we 
had best pick up the director and 
get the registration over as soon as 
possible. That is — ” he glanced 
uneasily at the radiant Zinder — 
“assuming that you wish to go 
through with it.” 

“For that sort of money,” said 
Ren ruefully, “the deal had better 
be legally complete. Though the 
devil knows how it’s going to look 
on the account books.” Despite the 
immensity of his blunder the humor 
of the situation overwhelmed him 
and he started to chuckle spasmodi- 
cally at his own discomfort. 



50 



IF 




T he assembled crowd was be- 
ginning to disperse with much 
laughter and amused speculation. 
Not a few ^ame to have a closer 
look at Zinder wearing the cus- 
tomary bondage halter. For a 
moment Ren felt angered by what 
he regarded as morbid curiosity. 
But when he saw the proud and 
dominant strength in Zinder’s face 
he realized that on the end of the 
halter was a powerful social ca- 
talyst. What he was parading 
through the streets was the anach- 
ronistic shame of Anharitte’s slave 
trade. He and the Pointed Tails 
were being used to underscore the 
unfairness and absurdity of the 
system. While he was agent for the 
titular master, it was obviously the 
slave who held command of the 
situation and the hearts of the 
onlookers. 

Thinking deeply in this vein, Ren 
walked ahead. Catuul followed, 
leading Zinder on the halter as if 
she were any common beast. Four 
of the Pointed Tails armsmen acted 
as a guard detail and also carried 
the torches, which were just needing 
to be lit as the purple dusk closed 
down. Ren found the journey acu- 
tely embarrassing. His civilized in- 
stincts prompted him to make con- 
versation with Zinder, whose in- 
tellectual talents were probably 
more than equal to his own. But the 
halter she wore about her neck 



made such an action seem incong- 
ruous and he could think of no topic 
of conversation that could span the 
dual standards that had been thrust 
upon him. 

He therefore stalked ahead of the 
group, growing increasingly angry 
at his own inability to resolve the 
conflict within himself. He sensed 
in the situation the ingenuity of the 
Imaiz in attacking the slave 
problem in this particular way and 
his respect for the wizard increased 
considerably. The Imaiz was 
forming a schism not only in so- 
ciety but also deep in the psyches of 
individual participants — such as 
himself. It was a dangerous and 
powerful game, and Ren knew that 
if Dion-daizan were not stopped 
he would ultimately win the ba^jtle. 

Magno Vestevaal was waiting in 
Ren’s chambers. The director had 
been drinking liberally, presumably 
celebrating a victory that had not 
been won. Ren roused him from his 
chair, knowing the worst had best 
be told without delay. 

“We have to go immediately to 
the prefecture to register the bond.” 
“Register?” Vestevaal’s eyes re- 
focused on Ren in an instant. 
“What the hell do you mean?” 

“I mean that the Imaiz played 
with us as he might with fools. You 
now own Zinder.” 

“Own Zinder?” Vestevaal ap- 
peared to sober himself by a tre- 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



51 




mendous effort of wUl. “I see! And 
how much did this — ah — acqui- 
sition cost us, Tito?” 

“Fourteen barrs to the tenth 
power,” said Ren, being de- 
liberately obtuse to soften the 
shock. 

“What in hell is that in terms of 
money?” 

Ren bent over his office calcu- 
lator and converted the figures first 
to duodecimal galactic credits and 
then to the Terran ten-based 
notation which the director handled 
more happily. Vestevaal watched 
him steadily, sensing in Ren's ac- 
tions a cer^in reticence that fore- 
told of trouble. 

“WeU?” 

Ren had finished the calculations 
and was examining the printout, 
wondering how to present it in the 
best light. 

“You’d better sit down again,” 
he said. “Would you believe about 
two hundred million million Solar 
dollars?” 

For a moment the director ap- 
peared in danger of suffering a sei- 
zure. At last he swore. “You could 
buy two battle cruisers for less. 
Tito — have you any idea how I’m 
going to explain that sort of expen- 
diture to the Freetrade Council? 
What are you trying to do— ruin 
me?” 

“No, but I think it’s a reasonable 
certainty that the Imaiz is. He 



promised to teach you a lesson. I 
guess this is it. But I still think 
we’ve hit him where it hurts. After 
all, we’ve got Zinder.” 

“Where is she?” asked Vestevaal. 
The color was slowly coming back 
into his cheeks. “Do you have her?” 

“She’s outside with Catuul and 
the guard.” 

“Then fetch her in — fetch her in! 
Where’s your hospitality, Tito? It’s 
not every day you get the chance to 
entertain somebody who’s worth 
more than all your Company ex- 
ecutives rolled into one. 

Ren called for Zinder. Unlike 
Ren, Magno Vestevaal was in no 
doubt as to how she should be 
treated. He borrowed Ren’s sword 
to cut the halter from her neck, 
then handed her into a chair as 
though she were a queen. She took 
the incident completely unabashed. 
Already she seemed to have es- 
tablished with Vestevaal a degree of 
rapport that reached to depths Ren 
could not envision. She accepted 
wine and fell into a quiet con- 
versation with the director until 
Ren was forced to interrupt, fearing 
that if they further delayed they 
would become overdue for regis- 
tering her bond. 

The remainder of the journey to 
the prefecture was in marked con- 
trast with that from the slave 
market. Magno Vestevaal led the 
way, engaged in earnest con-

IF 




versation with the slave girl on his 
arm, while Ren and Catuul 
followed disconsolately at their 
heels. The four armsmen had dis- 
persed themselves fore and aft of 
the group, swords drawn and ready 
for trouble, since Catuul still feared 
an ambush or an interference de- 
signed to delay the Registration of 
the bond. The director, however, ri- 
diculed the idea of potential trouble 
and refused even to remain consis- 
tently within the shield of guards. 
He was right — inasmuch as they ar- 
rived at the grim portals of the 
prefecture without any sign of un- 
wanted intervention. 

VIII 

T he prefecture was bustling 
with people. Watchmen were 
returning or departing on duty — 
clerks were fetching and carrying 
their massive volumes and a small 
mob around the slave registry was 
presumably waiting to see the regis- 
tration of Zinder. Ren was not sur- 
prised to sec Barii, the Imaizs 
slave-caste steward in the group — 
and Dion-daizan himself. Everyone 
turned to watch as the director and 
his costly prize came across the 
threshold. 

Dion-daizan made a bow of cour- 
tesy to Magno Vestevaal, which the 
latter good-humoredly returned. 
The director seemed in remarkably 



good spirits, having regained his 
equilibrium completely after his 
shock of learning of Ren’s transac- 
tion. His reaction to Dion-daizan 
was an acknowledgment of the ex- 
cellence of his adversary. Dion’s re- 
spect was no less evident. Both men 
turned to regard Zinder, who stood 
peacock-proud watching the 
register clerk intently as he 
painstakingly wrote the details of 
her bondage on a new page of his 
mammoth book. 

Di Irons came out of his office 
and took charge of the proceedings. 
His manner suggested that it was 
important for the peace of the city 
that the registration went smoothly. 
The prefect inspected the entry 
carefully, held it up for Dion-diazan 
to examine, then called for the 
mark of the auctioneer to authenti- 
cate the sale. 

Catuul went suddenly tense. He 
had momentarily lost sight of Barii, 
but finally located him standing be- 
hind the Imaiz, who had retired 
discreetly to the rear. Like Ren, the

scribe had the gravest doubts that 
the Imaiz would permit the regis- 
tration to be completed, but it was 
difFicult to see how he could now 
prevent its finalization. Everyone in 
the room felt the tension rise and 
additional watchmen came out 
from some dark antechamber to 
stand silent and ready for trouble. 

After the auctioneer had made 
his mark several statutory witnesses 
followed — Mallow Rade came to 
sign on behalf of the Pointed Tails. 
It was then Vestevaal’s turn to sign 
as the ultimate purchaser. Such a 
succession of names was not usually 
required, but Di Irons was taking 
no chances. Necessity demanded 
that this was one registration that 
could never be disputed. 

^Vestevaal was aware that he 
could be altering the course of his- 
tory on Roget as he took out his 
pen. He was buying a legend for 
hard cash, and the implication of 
the completed deal was that even 
enlightenment had its price. This 
was not, he reflected ruefully, the 
first time nor w.as .Roget the first 
world on which that lesson had 
been learned. As he turned from 
the book he could not resist flashing 
a look of triumph in the direction of 
Dion-daizan. In return he recefved 
a polite smile, which might have 
signified resignation — but probably 
did not. 

The director turned and held out 



his hand, indicating that Zinder 
should walk before him. Then a 
gasp of amazement from the 
onlookers diverted his attention 
back to the register. To his as- 
tonishment he saw the lines of ink 
begin to smoke and spread out, 
charring the surrounding paper. 
Some potent chemical reaction 
caused a glow that quickly became 
a flame that ran up the angled 
page — and though Vestevaal seized 
another volume and beat upon the 
burning book, he succeeded only in 
completely breaking up the fragile 
ash, which further disintegrated of 
its own volition. 



ALL eyes turned accusingly to the 
xX Imaiz, then back to Di Irons, 
wondering hbw the situation was 
going to be resolved. The prefect, a 
cloud of smoke still about his star- 
tled head, growled in a voice like 
thunder and savagely pulled the 
book toward him as he brushed 
away the burned edges. 

“Dion-daizan — I take it this is 
some work of yours.” 

“Mine?” The Imaiz sounded 
shocked. “There are ten good 
people between myself and the 
book — and have been all evening. 
Likewise, my servant Barii has not 
approached the proceedings. I 
could have had no more to do with 
the loss of the entry than— say — 



54 \ 



IF 




Agent Ren had with the loss of the 
title I once owned.” 

“You make a good point,” said 
Di Irons, glancing sourly at Ren, 
who had come forward to examine 
the burned page of the register. 
”The question is, what's to be done 
now?” 

“Who claims the title to Zinder?” 
asked the Imaiz, His voice, though 
soft, carried perfectly. 

“I do, of course,” said Vestevaal. 
“Then I contest your title to the 
bond. I submit that at this moment 
you can no more prove your owner- 
ship than could I a short while after 
Zinder was taken from me.” 

“There must have been a thou- 
sand witnesses to my purchase 
tonight.” Vestevaal was adamant. 
“1 demand that the registration 
begin anew.” 

“You have a thousand witnesses, 
but all Anharitte knew for ten years 
that Zinder belonged to me. Whose 
evidence is the stronger?” 

“Stop this!” thundered Di Irons. 
“Dion, I shall have many words to 
say to you concerning your conduct 
this night. And you. Director, and 
your puppet Ren, are beginning to 
tire my patience. In the circum- 
stances — I can see that the Imaiz 
has a valid point. Your situation is 
no different from his a little while 
ago. If justice is to be done I think 
the case should be treated in the 
same way.” 



“What docs that mean?” asked 
Vestevaal sharply. 

“If you wish. Director,, your so- 
ciety can contest my decision in tbe 
supreme court at Gaillen. I advise 
you now that it would be a waste of 
time to do so, with the Imaiz so 
closely attentive to his own claims. 
But my own ruling is this: it^s the 
considered opinion of the 
prefecture that the bondship of 
Zinder still has no clear tenure. 
Under the law it is therefore my 
duty to impound the slave girl in 
question and return her to the 
market for public auction. I have 
no more to say on the subject.” 

“But 1 have,” said Vestevaal an- 
grily. “I’ve paid a great sum of 
money for that girl. Do I not get 
that back?” 

“What? You squeal because your 
agents forced a bad bargain?” Di 
Irons was cuttingly acid. “Come 
now! As a merchant you’re fully 
aware that all purchases in An- 
haritte are on the basis of caveat 
emptor — let the purchaser beware. 
Ren was warned by myself most 
specifically not to proceed with the 
gambit. And I’m sure your 
reputation for trade on this planet 
would be little helped by your con- 
tinuing such a claim. Especially — ” 
he leaned forward heavily — ^^“since 
the money was provided by the 
Freetrade Council for the express 
purpose of causing civil mischief in 



THE WIZARD OF ANHARITTE 



55 




Anharitte. Do you care to take 
that matter to court, Director? I 
doubt the planetary government 
would view the proceedings with 
much favor.” 

Vestevaal appeared on the verge 
of making a critically harsh reply. 
Then he looked at Zinder. She met 
his gaze with level inquiry, as if 
searching for something she ex- 
pected to find in him. Vestevaal 
reacted with sudden resolutions — a 
smile of tired humor lit his face. 

“My apologies. Prefect. I spoke 
out of turn. Of course I respect 
your ruling on both counts. Never 
let it be said that Magno Vestevaal 
doesn’t know how to accept defeat 
with dignity.” 

Vestevaal turned to Zinder and 
kissed her hand, then bowed to 
Dion-daizan. He turned to Ren and 
Catuul Gras and indicated that they 
all should leave. 

“Well, Tito — how’s that for 
being outclassed?” Vestevaal’s 
voice held a note of genuine 
appreciation. ‘‘I’ve seen some 
rank skulduggery among the 
Freetraders, but believe me, Dion- 
daizan makes the rest of them look 
like amateurs. Damn it — I’d love to 
see him on the council!” 

‘‘Are we going to take the debt 
for Zinder without fighting?” asked 
Ren. 

“We have no alternative. We 
dare nqt go to court lest we sour 



the attitude of the planetary 
government toward Freetrade. You 
know how parochial these hick- 
world governments can be.” 

“This makes me wonder if there’s 
a collusion between the Imaiz and 
the prefect.” 

“I don’t think so. Di Irons is the 
straightest man I’ve ever come 
across. But he’s trying to use unso- 
phisticated laws to control a situa- 
tion with which even sophisticated 
laws would find it difficult to cope. 
So he compensates by applying a 
good measure of rough horse-sense. 
And why shouldn’t he? It’s just that 
sort of approach that keeps An- 
haritte the place it is. And at least 
he’s helped to cut our losses.” 

“I don’t follow that.” 

Vestevaal laughed heartily and 
clapped Ren on the back. 

“My dear Tito, you’re too damn 
sober. Don’t you realize that 
without Zinder we’ve one less 
mouth to feed and back to clothe. 
And there’s a further problem you 
haven’t even thought of. Suppose 
we had retained her — what the hell 
would we have found to do with 
her?” 

The following day Zinder was 
again put up for sale. The Imaiz 
took up the bidding and this time 
nobody opposed him. The hammer 
fell at the price of one bar. And this 
was perhaps the final irony.

WHOM 

THE

LOVE 

The discovery of contempo- 
rary gods on other planets oc- 
casioned a concerted inquiry 
into Earth* s past that threw 
new light on the ‘^legendary** 
gods of old. The Greek and the 
Asgard pantheons acquired 
new dimensions and even his- 
tory at last admitted that, ages 
ago, Zeus and company had 
dwelled upon the slopes of 
Mount Olympus — and that in 



57 




times of old, Odin had really 
sat on the high-seat in 
Hlidskjalf 

The provenance of the 
gods was another matter. The 
dead ones could not talk and 
the living ones could be 
contacted otUy through their 
worshipers who, quite under- 
standably, dared not risk of- 
fending them by voicing 
impious questions. The present 
consensus is that they are the 
scattered remnants of a once- 
great galactic race whose 
heyday predates the dawn of 
man. Such an opinion would 
seem to impugn their divinity. 
That it does not merely points 
up the psychological need of 
the average mortal to stand in 
awe of beings ostensibly nobler 
than himself, whether they be 
true gods, savior-kings or Ken- 
nedys, 

— Zyre: What is a God?, 

pp. 261-2 

I F THERE were any Niefi in- 
stallations^ on Northstar \19, 
Recoh Officer Hale could not find 
them. True, no one had said 
definitely that there were — only 
that there might be. But it was 
Hale’s job to eliminate might^be’s, 
which explains his presence in the 
skies of the polestar’s nineteenth 
planet. 



But although he found no enemy 
installations, he found something 
else: four cities. They stood on the 
banks^ of an eccentric river that 
snaked its way across a verdant 
plain dominated by a shining 
mountain — and all of them were 
dead. 

No time limit had been imposed 
on Hale’s Northstar 19 mission and 
he certainly was in no hurry to get 
back to the Earth-Niefi War. So 
he decided to find out what kind of 
cities they were, or rather, what 
kind of cities they had been. He 
chose the one nearest the mountain 
(for some reason the mountain fas- 
cinated him) and brought his recon- 
craft down in the middle of its 
central square. He opened the locks 
and climbed down to the ground. 

Stone edifices, some still intact, 
others with fallen walls and 
collapsed roofs, stared at him in the 
midmorning sunlight. Both their 
size and design indicated they had 
been built by men like himself. He 
took a deep breath of the unpurified 
air, smelled the greenness of trees 
and grass and the dust of desuetude. 
He was suddenly glad he had come. 

He had memorized the city's con- 
formation during his descent and 
knew that the square was on the 
crest of a hill. The buildings beyond 
had been built upon the hillside and 
stood in a wid^ band around the 
base. On the east the city was bor- 



58 



IF 




dered by the river, on the south by a 
forest and on the west by a park or 
graveyard. To the north the ruins 
gradually gave way to grassy low- 
lands, which once upon a time, no 
doubt, had known the bite of plow- 
shares. 

The architecture of the buildings 
forming the square had a Hellenic 
flavor. The arch was nowhere in 
evidence, and columns and entab- 
latures prevailed. One of the 
buildings brought the Parthenon to 
mind; although the resemblance 
was superficial at best. A huge 
statue stood before the columned 
entrance. Perhaps it was the way 
the morning sunlight struck it, 
turning it to gold, that made Hale's 
interest leap — perhaps it was the 
haughty aspect of the lofty head. In 
either case, he walked across the 
square and stood before it. It was 
the statue of a goddess. 

Unlike the columns, which were 
limestone, she had been sculptured 
of granite. A few faded streaks of 
dye informed him that her hair was 
black. It fell to her shoulders, disci- 
plined only by a band worn around 
her forehead. Breast plates, me- 
tallic skirt and thonged sandals 
completed her attire. 

He looked up at this comely 
granite girl, this stone goddess of 
the long legs, the bursting breasts, 
the Grecian arms and shoulders. 
Her face made him think of Byron 



and Keats. It expressed what they 
had been trying to say. The quick 
sweep of nose from high wide 
forehead to upper lip spoke of 
strength — the sensuous yet noble 
mouth somehow suggested a 
knowledge of the weakness of men. 
The girlish chin was godly. Once, 
no doubt, painted pupils had lent 
life to her sightless eyes. Time had 
taken it a^ay. 

He brought his own eyes down to 
the base of the pedestal on which 
she stood. There was writing there, 
etched meticulously into the stone. 
Picture writing. There was a word 
that looked like a plow, one that 
looked like a sword. One that 
looked like a snake probably sym- 
bolized the river. There was a word 
that looked like a tree, three that 
looked like stars. There was one 
that suggested the city — 

At length he came to her name: 

Entering the temple — for such it ^ 
proved to be — he found that with 
the exception of one feature it was 
devoted entirely to her. The ex- 
ception stood just within the en- 
trance — a great granite statue of 
Herculean symmetry and grace 
whose stern countenance, albeit 



WHOM THE GODS LOVE 



59 




beardless, suggested Zeus. Unques- 
tionably it represented the major 
deity. Nevertheless, this was not his 
temple — it was 

Statues of her were everywhere— 
statues, statuettes and busts. Some 
were carved of limestone, some of 
granite — others . were cast in 
bronze. The central floor space was 
given over to two parallel rows of 
stone inches, an aisle running 
down between them to a granite 
altar flanked by two bronze bra- 
ziers black with age. 

In a number of places the roof 
had fallen in and Hale had to pick 
his way around piles of fallen ma- 
sonry to reach the altar. He halted 
before it. A life-size statue 
of stood just behind it. This 

one had eyes and wore a dress. The 
dress half-covered the full breasts 
and fell but little lower than the 
hips. The eyes were represented by 
ice-blue chips of glass. 

He found them disconcerting. 

As he stood staring into their cold 
and glittering depths the conviction 
overcame him that he himself was 
being observed. Not from within 
the temple or even from the adja- 
cent buildings— but from afar. 

He tried to rid himself of the 
feeling, but it would not go away. 

Before leaving the temple, he 
looked once more at the towering 
statue just within the entrance. This 
time, he examined the pedestal. It, 



too, was covered with ideographs. 
At length he found the one that 
stood for the deity’s name: 

O UTSIDE, he made his way 
down the hillside to the lower 
city. Here the broken buildings 
were fewer, while partly filled-in 
depressions marked the cellars of 
wooden dwellings that had long ago 
either fallen or burned to the 
ground. Clearly this was the section 
of the poor. 

He felt more at home here than 
on the hill. 

The conviction that he was being 
observed intensified, but the feeling 
now was of being watched from 
nearby rather than from afar. It 
was possible, he supposed, that 
some of the buildings were in- 
habited. Both the reconcraft’s poli- 
meter and its sentience detector 
were reliable instruments — but the 
former responded only to reason- 
ably large groups of structures, 
while the latter could not detect the 
presence of intelligent life forms ex- 
cept in reasonably large groups 
(specifically, the minimum number 
of structures and the minimum 
amount of personnel the Niefi 
would need to establish an effective 
military installation). Nevertheless, 
Hale found it hard to believe that 
anyone abided in the city. It did not 



60 



IF 




matter in any case: the Niefi could 
be discounted altogether (they 
abhorred human cities), and the 
high-intensity incandescer strapped 
to Hale’s right wrist would be more 
than a match for anything a bronze- 
age semi-savage might throw or 
thrust at him. 

He spent the rest of the day 
poking among the ruins. They fas- 
cinated him. He found pottery- 
shards, blackened utensils and 
bones. Most of the bones seemed to 
be those of women and children, 
but as a layman he could not, of 
course, be certain. Once he caught a 
blur of movement at the edge of his 
vision, but although he turned his 
head quickly he saw nothing. 

He skipped lunch. For supper he 
ate a can of synthichicken and half 
a loaf of canned bread and drank a 
thermopint of ale. The ale made 
him drowsy and he partially dozed 
afterward as he sat in the reconcraft 
lock, watching the blue mists of 
evening creep down from the plain. 
He decided to stay the night and 
perhaps the morrow too. Why not? 
The war could get on without him 
for another day. From what he had 
learned thus far he felt sure the 
ruins were remnants of a once-pros- 
perous and powerful city-state on 
the order of Athens or Lace- 
daemon. Perhaps, years ago, the 
four cities had engaged in an 
internecine “Peloponnesian War’’ 



that had left but few survivors. 
Among the stars man had already 
found a hundred histories of him- 
self— here, perhaps, was another. 

W 'HEN the valley filled with 
night. Hale closed the locks 
and climbed up into the little cabin 
in the reconcraft’s nose. He un- 
dressed, turned out the light and lay 
down on his bunk. On the opposite 
bulkhead an oval porthole looked 
out upon the crumbling cornices of 
the higher edifices. He lay helpless 
in the dark, waiting for Gwendolyn 
to come into his mind. He and she 
had met years earlier at a posh 
beach resort, where he had been 
employed as a swimming in- 
structor. All summer long they had 
been lovers and after she had 
returned to her home in Greater 
Philadelphia he had traveled more 
than five hundred miles to pay her a 
surprise visit. The season had 4>een 
late September, hazy-hot, and he 
had perspired as he walked up the 
wide shaded walk to the patio-por- 
tico that fronted the rambling neo- 
renaissance house. In the columned 
coolness tall young men and tall 
young women had lolled, tall cool 
glasses in their hands. He remem- 
bered a flurry of movement, a blur 
of color as he had come into sight 
from the shade. A door had opened 
and slammed shut. He had wanted 
to turn around and go back, but 



WHOM THE GODS LOVE 



61 




had been unable. He had had to 
keep walking until he had come to 
the marble steps and asked the 
question whose false answer still 
burned in his mind. Gwen? One of 
the tall young men had answered, 
ice cubes tinkling as he talked. Oh, 
she got suddenly called away. 

Away, away, away . 

Tonight as on other nights he 
waited and waited, but she did not 
come and at last he closed his eyes. 
He could see the ruins. They drifted 
past his inner vision like gray sheep. 
He counted them and presently he 
slept. 

i^VAKENING deep in the night, 
I\, he lay in the darkness 
searching his mind for the reason 
sleep had fled. He could not Find it. 

At last he got up, stepped over to 
the porthole and looked through 
the thick glass down into the 
square. All three of Northstar 19’s 
moons were in the sky. The flag- 
stones were silver in , the multi- 
moonlight and the broken buildings 
stood like argent ghosts. Shadows 
played along their feet, making eva- 
nescent patterns in the night. At 
first he thought his mind was 
projecting an image of Gwen, but 
he knew instantly that the girl 
standing in the square was not — 
could not be — she. This was 
someone else altogether, yet 
someone he was sure he knew. He 



saw first of all the blazing blackness 
of her hair and then he saw the 
nightflower of her face. Gradually 
her body took shape in the multiple 
light — he saw the shining hillocks 
of her breasts, the silver pillars of 
her legs, the pale shadow of her 
pubic hair. The pillars quivered in 
the multi-moonlight, subtly faded 
away. When he searched the 
shadows for her face it 'was no 
more — her black hair blended 1)ack 
into the night. And the square slept 
in the multi-moonlight, dreamed in 
the multi-moonlight and all was as 
it had been before. 

He stepped back across the little 
room and dropped down again on 
his bunk. He lay with his hands 
clasped behind his head, thinking. 
Whoever had been in the square 
was not a ghost. Ghosts did not 
haunt dead poleis. 

But sometimes tutelary gods did. 

T iHE next morning Hale had a 
look at the building before 
which his nocturnal visitor .had 
stood. It told him nothing. 

The day was golden, the air 
sparkling with particles of dis- 
persed dew. Beyond the ruins, 
treetops twinkled in a sporadic 
morning wind. After a light 
breakfast, he went back down into 
the lower city and resumed his 
unofficial investigation of the ruins. 
He found more pottery shards. 



62 



IF 




more blackened utensils and more 
bones. 

He also found a second Temple 
of ^ 

It stood on the southern out- 
skirts, at the feet of the forest that 
climbed the valley’s slope to the 
plain. It was larger than its sister on 
the hill and this, together with its 
location, led him to conclude it had 
been built expressly for the poor. 

Going inside, he found it like its 
sister both within and without. 
There were more benches and the 
altar at the end of the aisle was 
larger. But the altar statue was the 
same. 

Down front was a girl, sitting on 
one of the benches. A girl clad in 
bronze armor, with a forehead band 
encircling her black hair. 

Hale was not surprised. He had 
never seen a goddess, but he knew 
he was seeing one now. He also 
knew, from history, that Athena 
Polias had haunted ancient Athens 
long after her true worshipers had 
turned to dust. 

If Athena Polias had haunted her 
dead polis, why couldn’t haunt 
hers? 

H e walked down the aisle, 
through slanted columns of 
sunlight, around piles of fallen 
stone. She did not turn her head. 

When he reached the bench she 
was sitting on he sat down beside 



her, not because he dared to, but 
because he didn’t know what else to 
do. 

She faced him and he saw the 
quick sweep of nose from high wide 
forehead to upper lip and the god- 
like girlish chin. Her eyes surprised 
him. He had expected to find ice in 
them — instead he found the sum- 
mer skies of Earth. 

In contrast her hair made him 
think of the blackness of winter 
forests — its disarray of the wind on 
a winter’s night. 

She said, Vve been waiting for 
you since dawn. 

She had spoken into his mind. He 
found he could speak into hers. You 
watched me all day yesterday. Why 
didn't you reveal yourself to me 
then? 

I revealed myself to you last 
night. 

Yes, he said, but not as you are 
now. Why did you wait so long? 

Your mind has a wall around it, 
like mine, / could not see inside. 

Can you see inside it now? 

Only a little — not enough to tell 
me where you really came from or 
who you really are. But I decided to 
contact you anyway, 

Vm glad, he said. I've a lot of 
questions to ask. About you and 
about your city-state. 

There were three other poleis like 
it, as you no doubt know. Many 
years ago they grew envious of one

another and engaged in a long and 
disastrous war. The final battle was 
fought upon the plain. The women 
fought beside the men — those who 
had not been murdered along with 
their children in successive rapes of 
the four cities. 

^ Were there no survivors? 

A few. They became shepherds 
and live far away beyond the moun- 
tain and the' plain. They blame the 
cities for their misfortune — they 
regard them as places of evil and 
will not live in them any more.

guardian goddesses of the other 
city-states. There are other pan- 
theons^ but they are inferior to 
ours. 

^ Where do you live? Hale asked. 

We live high upon the mountain 
that looks down upon the plain. I 
thought you knew. 

I guessed. Hale said, but I didn*t 
know.

I cant. Til take you there tomor- 
row. Perhaps tonight. v 
She stepped sideways, slipped 
from sight. He stared at where she 
had stood. Oddly, her absence 
brought home to him more forcibly 
than had her presence the fact that 
she was a goddess, and momen- 
tarily he was overcome by awe. For 
a while he founckit difficult to be- 
lieve that he had not dreamed the 
meetings- But in the end he knew 
that it had been real and that he 
would see her again. 

H e skipped his midday meal 
again and went on a tour of 
the river bank. The Earth-Niefi 
War seemed to recede with every 
step he took. It had less reality for 
him now than the one that had 
talcen place here on Northstar 19 — 
how many years ago? He felt sus; 
pended between present and past. 

Stone wharves protruded into the 
river. He walked out on one of 
them, sat down in the sunlight and 



64 



IF 




let his legs hang over the water. The 
current was sluggish, almost imper- 
ceptible, and the river, wide at this 
point, brought to his mind a blue 
lake. Once the simile became fixed 
in his mind it was inevitable that he 
should see the raft. Even so, he 
found it odd that Gwendolyn 
should enter his reverie when she 
was so far backstage from the 
proscenium of his thoughts. 

The raft was anchored in the mid- 
dle of the lake. There were two 
people on it. Beyond their golden 
glistening bodies a distant frieze of 
summer homes showed against a 
blue terrestrail sky. 

Hale looked but little different 
then from how he was now. Tall 
and spare, almost beautiful in his 
virile handsomeness. Gwen was a 
flaming nymph in the sunlight. 
When they went out together he al- 
ways had trouble wearing clothes. 
He worked hard at it and achieved 
a degree of aptitude — but the poor 
look well dressed only to the pen- 
niless. and he knew that in her eyes 
he was a store- window mannikin on 
. parade. On the raft it was different. 
Nearly naked in the sun he was her 
peer and she accepted him as such. 
More important — he accepted him- 
self as such. 

She had said she loved him as 
they walked one moonlit night 
along the shore, the waves fainting 
at their feet. Her words had been 



more than a declaration of love — 
they had been an invitation. He had. 
been accustomed to such invita- 
tions,'6ut he had found this one dis- 
concerting. Later, in the dark boat- 
house, he had been . more dis- 
concerted yet — and hurt as well — 
to find he was not the Tirst and 
possibly not even the second or the 
third. But his disenchantment had 
not lasted and by the end of the 
summer he had been more deeply in 
love with her than he had been be- 
fore. Maturely in love . had been 
the way he had expressed it to him- 
self. What he had felt toward her 
before had been mere boyish in- 
fatuation. It wasn’t finding out that 
the rich were like everybody else 
that wrecked poor-boy lover — it 
was ilAding out that the truth had 
no effect upon his fascination. 

T he raft went away and the 
river came back, and a flock of 
heronlike birds rose from the r^s 
and flapped across the stream to 
the opposite bank where the frieze 
of summer homes had been. Hale 
liked the river better, found 
Northstar’s warmth more com- 
forting than Sol’s. Perhaps here 
was where he belonged.

ternoon wandering over the 
grassy lowlands and returned to the

petite, but he forced himself to eat. 
Then he walked through the ruins 
to the lower-city temple of . 

The temple was empty. He 
walked down the aisle and sat on 
the bench where they had met. As 
he sat there in the silence the first 
moon climbed into the sky and sent 
her silver footprints down the aisle, 
then withdrew them to shine down 
through the crevices in the roof. 
The second moon arose and she too 
made obeisance at the altar be- 
fore looking down from above. He 
knew that it was growing late, re- 
membered that had said 

“perhaps” she might be there. But 
he went on sitting in the silver 
silence, hoping. 

She did not come. He stood up at 
last, dumb with disappointment, 
and walked out into the night. The 
third moon was climbing up the 
star-runged ladder of the east and 
the light of night was as the light of 
day. He wandered among the ruins. 
Passing a megalithic platform, he 
pictured a politician standing on it, 
making promises to the poor. 

Presently he came to a garden, 
passed through its gate and sat 
down in the multi-moonlight. A lit- 
tle distance away a waterless foun- 
tain stood like a silver centerpiece. 
Weeds grew riotously around his 
feet. Suddenly he heard her step 
and saw her just beyond the garden 
wall. She came through the garden 



gate, her armor blazing, her black 
hair gleaming in the night. 

You weren*t in the temple, she 
said. Then I saw you sitting here. 

He said, I waited for you for 
hours. I thought you werent 
coming. 

She said, Til take you to the bat- 
tlefield. 

He walked with her through the 
ruins and they climbed the forested 
slope to the plain. The^ walked over 
the plain in the multi-moonlight, 
the shining mountain rising on their 
right. Around them herds of wild 
livestock slept. Ululations sounded 
from far away. 

They circumvented a quarry that 
had become an artesian lake and 
came at last to a huge circular 
depression bordered by sprucelike 
trees. She halted just beyond the 
fringe of trees and he halted beside 
her. He looked into her summer- 
sky eyes, silvery now — at the wild 
blackness of her hair. A trembling 
began in his hands. He said. Let me 
count the ways . 

She looked back at him, puzzled. 
The wall around your mind has 
grown higher. What is it you do not 
wish me to see? 

Nothing, he said. Is this the bat- 
tlefield? 

Yes. The Cwm of the Dead. 

He saw the bones. They began at 
his feet, spread outward, littering 
the entire basin. Interspersed

among them were battered shields, 
broken swords, bits and pieces of 
armor — all black with age. Oddly, 
he was reminded of the utensils he 
had dug up. 

Surely the gods could have 
averted such a tragedy. 

No, ifC/ said. We could not 
avert it because we were gods. The 
people of my polls prayed to me to 
bring them victory, while the people 
of my sisters* poleis prayed to them 
to bring them victory. Thus^tf^p^ 
decreed as he did. 

But he could have stopped it. 

Only at the expense of creating 
dissension among the gods and this 
he would not do. Thus he decreed as 
he did, fully aware of the conse- 
quences. Since the war we have be- 
come gods without worshipers. The 
survivors have turned their backs 
on us and have taken to worshiping 
savior kings. We no longer know 
what it is like to be adored. I no 
longer know what it is like. 

I adore you. Hale said. 

She turned toward him. Yes, but 
in a different way. She stepped 
closer to him, her gaze warm upon 
his face. He found her hand in his. 
It was like the moonlight, light, 
cool and soft — and somehow the 
three qualities passed from her 
palm through his and became com- 
mingled with his blood, apotheo- 
sizing him. He found himself 
kissing her in the multi-moonlight. 



the women he had known before 
her transmuting to glass beads on a 
cheap necklace in his mind, Gwen 
the gaudiest zircon of them all. 

And yet it was he who pulled 
away. We have no right to make 
love here, he said. Not in the Cwm 
of the Dead. 

In the beginning Love met Death 
in the dark woods of the world and 
found him to be her twin. 

I have no right to make love to 
you in any case. 

Why? 

He stared at her. Because — 

He saw that she had turned and 
was pointing across the battlefield. 
We are about to be attacked. Look. 

There were five of them. Wolves. 
Not the kind he was familiar with, 
but enough like them to justify the 
term. They were loping across the 
cwm, spreading outward as they 
came. ’s right arm was al- 
ready extended — now she extended 
her fingers and white fire leaped 
from their tips. The lead wolf be- 
came a gout of flame. But the 
remaining four did not even slow 
their pace. ’s second thun- 

derbolt missed. Hale extended his 
own right arm. Two tongues of blue 
and brilliant flame seemed to leap 
from his fingertips and the two 
foremost wolves disintegrated. 

incinerated the fourth — and 
the fifth, badly singed, retreated 
into the night.

T hey walked back across the 
plain in the multi-moonlight 
holding hands, their shoulders 
touching now and then, the three 
moons slipping swiftly down the 
western slope of night. The moment 
they entered the forest she 
unclasped her armor and let it fall 
to the ground. Then she pulled him 
into a flower-carpeted arbor and 
drew him down upon her. Not once, 
she whispered. Not once, but a 
thousand times ... A golden ladder 
appeared from somewhere and he 
climbed it high into the sky. There 
was a bursting in his brain — the 
ladder trembled and he fell. He 
climbed it again, this time even 
higher into the sky, only to fall once 
more, white fires burning in his 
brain. 

He did not know how many times 
he climbed and fell. He did not 
care. Toward morning they made 
their way down through the forest 
and halted before the lower-city 
temple. I must go now, 
said. He pulled her tightly 
against him, tried to imprison her 
with his arms. No, not yet, / may 
never see you again! Her body 
trembled, lost substance. In a 
moment only the ghost of her re- 
mained. And then even the ghost 
was gone, but not before he heard it 
whisper. You are the first real god I 
have ever known! 

He was thunderstruck. 



H e stood in the fading moon- 
light, staring at where she had 

been. 

You are the first real god I have 
ever known , . 

She had seen him ride down from 
heaven on a huge and shining 
“steed” such as she had never 
dreamed of. She had seen him 
unleash “thunderbolts” more 
powerful than her own. She, who 
had probably entered hundreds of 
unsophisticated mortal minds, had 
encountered a wall when she tried 
to enter his. 

She had mistaken him for a god 
from the beginning. A god, 
perhaps, from one of the other pan- 
theons. 

The rosy-fingered dawn had 
drawn a pink line along the eastern 
horizon. Hale walked slowly back 
to the reconcraft, climbed into the 
control room and sat down. 

In a way, he was a god. 

True, there were billions of other 
gods like him. But they did not 
dwell on Northstar 19 and never 
would. 

The first golden fingers of the sun 
reached through the locks and ex- 
tended themselves toward his feet. 
He had always thought his feet 
were made of clay. He saw now that 
they were not. 

He stood up. His shoulders 
seemed to brush the sky. The fading 
stars hovered inches from his head.

IF 




The intra-fleet communicator 
came to life. “Fleet Com to Recon 
Two. Acknowledge, RC Hale.” 

Hale looked down from his 
eminence at the picayune reminder 
of his past. 

“Repeat: FleetCom to Recon 
Two. Acknowledge, RC Hale. If 
unable to acknowledge, then return 
FleetCom immediately.” 

“I’m not going back,” Hale said. 

“What has gone wrong. Recon 
Officer Hale? Repeat: What has 
gone wrong?” 

“I’m a god,” Hale said. “I’m 
agoing to live among my own 
kind.” 

He got a pipe wrench out of the 
tool cabinet and smashed the com- 
municator’s face. 

He closed the locks ahd raised the 
reconcraft high above the dead city. 

They wouldn’t come looking for 
him — he wasn’t that important. But 
even if they did they would never 
find him. 

He pointed Pegasus toward the 
mountain. 

The mountain came to meet him 
and high up on its shining slopes he 
saw the marble columns of the hall 
of the gods. He guided Pegasus 
down from the sky, brought her to 
rest on the slope below and dis- 
mounted. 

He began walking up the slope in 
the hot sunlight. He started to 
sweat. Did gods perspire? He won- 



dered. It seemed like an uncouth 
trait for a god. 

The hall was huge, he saw as he 
neared it. Some of its columns had 
fallen. Its roof had collapsed in 
places. Clearly the gods were 
having a hard time shifting for 
themselves. But he would help 
them. He would use his techno- 
logical powers to help them rebuild 
the hall, remold it into the mag- 
nificent structure it had been be- 
fore. 

They had come out of the hall 
and were standing before the 
columned entrance, waiting to 

welcome him. He saw tall and 

mighty . He saw stately 

. He saw ^ s 

handsome brothers and sisters. 

He saw 

She had exchanged her armor for 
a white dress that barely covered 
her breasts and fell just below her 
hips. Her blue eyes glittered in the 
sunlight like shards of glass. 

He was very close to the hall 
now. He thought it odd that his 
fellow gods did not come forth 
to greet him. Then he saw 1 ^ 4 ^ 
raise his right arm, as though 
in salutation. He was about 
to raise his own in kind 
when a blast of brilliant blueness 
leaped from the deity’s fingertips. 
The bolt passed over Hale’s head 
and a moment later Pegasus 
vanished in a huge gout of flame. 



WHOM THE GODS LOVE

The mountain trembled. A hot 
wind seared the slope. 

Hale had halted horrified in his 
tracks. “You don’t understand!” he 
screamed. He looked desperately 
at 

Tell them who I am! Tell them 
what I am! 

looked coldly back at 
him. Kill him\ she said to 

lowered his arm, ex- 
tended fingers now pointed toward 
Hale’s head. Hale flung himself 
frantically to the left and the bolt 
passed over his shoulder. Blinded 
by its brightness, he went rolling 
and scrambling down the slope. 
Stones rattled around him. His in- 
candescer was torn from his wrist. 
When he reached the bottom of the 
slope he staggered to his feet and 
ran. A sound like the tinkling of ice 
cubes came from far above. It was 
the laughter of the gods. 

AFTER a while his vision 
l\. returned. He slowed his steps 
and began walking in the direction 
of the river. He did not reach it till 
late afternoon. He threw himself 
face down on the grassy bank and 
cupped water into his mouth. A low 
moan sounded from behind him. 
Turning, he saw the wolf. 

He twisted his body into a sitting 
position. Instinctively he raised his 
arm. Then he remembered that his 
incandescer was no longer strapped 



to his wrist, that it had been ir- 
retrievably lost on the slope. He let 
his arm drop to his side. 

The wolf did not move. Presently 
Hale realized that it had not 
followed him to the river, as he had 
at first assuhied, but had been there 
before he arrived. He saw that its 
right flank was badly burned, and 
recognized it as the wolf ’s 

final thunderbolt had singed. 

There was pain in the animal’s 
eyes. Hale raised his arm again. 
This time, the wolf crept to his side 
and settled down beside him. He 
stroked its coarse fur, then lay back 
exhausted on the grass. 

There were bound to be survivors 
living along the river. Eventually he 
would follow it far enough to find 
them. However much he might 
want to, he could not live alone. But 
he was not yet ready. First he must 
wait for his wound to heal, for the 
pain to go away. 

He closed his eyes and presently 
he slept. The gods looked down 
from above. But they did not see 
him — they saw only their reflec- 
tions in the stream. 

What is a god? A god is a 
being, mortal or immortal, who 
can with impunity doff his j her 
democratic mask the moment 
the need for it is past.

DAVID MAGIL 



The most terrifying 
life form in the 
universe was — himself! 





W ’E WERE in trouble, bad 
trouble. The outer wall of our 
reactor had cracked. The thermal 
sealant had leaked in. It was burned 



up, gone. We had repaired the fault, 
policed the area, but in order to 
keep from exceeding our thermal 
limit and blowing, every liquid on 
board the ship had been poured into 
our tanks. It wasn’t good enough. 
Power was evaporating the liquids. 
Temperatures on board were in 
excess of 108°F and they were 
building. Crew was down to 
minimal clothing, almost none. 
And the temperature was going to 
erase us. We didn’t have any liquid 
for human consumption. 

And we were 316 days from 
Emergency Base Extender. 

My ship. Patroller 374. My 
captaincy: Colonel Jack L. Powers, 



71 



United Earth Patrol Forces. Pur- 
pose of journey: normal patrol 
operation. Special situation: 
Inspector-passenger, General of 
Patrol Forces, Eight-star Senoir 
Commander Rallfeld> Ship’s state: 
Emergency 1. 

1 had. reported to General 
Rallfeld. He had made no com- 
ment, given no advice. And I had 
no idea. We simply had no other 
liquids on board. And without 
liquids we could either go black and 
freeze or go on until we fusioned. 

Temperature rose to 109®F. 

And there was no place to head, 
no place to go. The area was La- 
cuna G 47832. 

Crew working at maximum. All 
nonessential personnel confined to 
berths — minimal activity, attempt 
to add as little additional heat as 
possible. 

Working crew was demanding 
power. Not verbally, but I could see 
the demand every time they looked 
at me. One burst of full power for 
three minutes would lift our tem- 
perature five degrees. Where to use 
it? A three-minute tbrust toward 
Extender and maybe bring in a 
dead ship? A patrol ship was worth 
a fortune. Or a minute full-burst 
call to Extender requesting emer- 
gency rescue? Or a near search in 
case of remote possibility there was 
anything in area? G 47832 was 
largely uncharted. There might 



have been something within range. 

“Weiss. Near search. One minute 
on full power. Commander, see that 
everything else is cut off. Quickly as 
possible, Weiss.” 

“Sir,” he said and pushed his 
power call. 1 reached over and 
pushed “confirm” on my console. 

A twelve-second delay and the 
shot came through. I watched it on 
power control, I watched it on the 
thermometer. I watched it on the 
clock. The damned second hand 
just seemed to hang there — the P 4 
register didn’t. It was 140®F down 
there and I watched as it sped to 
145,147,149. 

“How far can we go in P four. 
Chief?” 

“Two-eleven, Captain. Maybe. 
I’m not sure. But maybe to two- 
eleven.” 

We were three degrees up. Could 
hardly feel it. Just felt thirsty. No 
hope for that. 

“Refrigeration off in J Seven, 
Captaiq.” 

“Anything for it?” 

“Nothing, sir. That’s directly 
above P Four. It was just a matter 
of time. You want perishables 
transferred, sir?” 

“Commander? How much heat 
would we generate moving it to 
nearest refrigeration? Get the list. 
See if anything essential is in it.” 
“Power off, sir,” the bosun told 
me.

IF 




“Fine. Weiss. Get that analysis as 
fast as you can.” 

“We’re at one-fourteen, sir.” 
“Bad. Get me General Rallfeld. 
Advise him of our situation.” 

“Sir.” 

“Weiss. What the hell’s hap- 
pening? You have anything? What’s 
taking so long?” 

“Sorry, sir. The twenty-nine 
eighty-seven is slow.” 

“Who the hell gave you consent 
to use it? You’re trained. Eye-read 
it! We’re trying to save power. 
Mister.” 

“Sir, I don’t know how to eye- 
read.” 

“You don’t. Any one of you 
here trained to eye-read a scan 
chart? No? Okay, Mister. Use the 
twenty-nine eighty-seven. Try to 
use it fast, will you.” 

“Yes, sir. I’m sorry, sir.” 

“Forget it. Just concentrate on 
what you can do.” 

“Sir.” 

I WANTED to get up and 
pace. But that would mean more 
heat. We couldn’t afford it. Even 
thinking was too much of an ex- 
penditure. What we needed was 
stasis. I had always laughed at the 
experiments on preservation, bio- 
suspensions. At Inter-Planetary 
Science Confederation Conferences 
I had voted against grants for such 
research. 1 regretted those votes 



now. I was on the verge of losing 
my ship, my men. 

“Major, you been on to General 
Rallfeld?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Any comment from him?” 

“No, sir. He just thanked you for 
the courtesy and wishes you luck, 
sir.” 

“Yes. Get back to him. No, Let 
me. How much power is used on 
full ship auditory?” 

“In thermals, a tenth of a degree, 
sir.” 

“What’s our bio limit. Doctor?” 
“We’re at one-eighteen. Captain. 
At one-forty we’ll begin to suffer 
severe impairment. 1 have the 
figures if you want them.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“We’ll lose fifteen per cent in the 
next twenty-two degrees, sir. 
Twenty per cent for every accretion 
of five beyond that. Chance of 
utilizable surviving crew non- 
existent by a hundred and sixty 
Fahrenheit.” 

“Thank you. Doctor.” 

“One nineteen, sir.” 

“Thank you, son.” I thought for 
a minute. I’d keep it short. No en- 
couragement. There surely wasn’t 
anything encouraging. I reached 
over and switched on the auditory. 

“Captain Powers here. Our situa- 
tion is deteriorating. We’re making 
every attempt to rectify it. We will 
keep you informed of any signifi-

cant developements. I’m speaking 
to you to ask if any of you have any 
memory of stories told you about 
Thermal Accelerate, any classroom 
studies, private investigations. If 
you have knowledge, information 
or ideas please report to Com- 
mander Rupler by auditory. Thank 
you.” I turned to Weiss after 
switching off. “Anything?” 
“Nothing yet, sir. There’s 
nothing in one or two quadrant.” 
“Go ahead with it. Stay easy, 
son.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

We were up to 121°F. 

“Captain. P Four is beyond 
human habitation.” 

“Thank you. Doctor. What goes 
next?” 

“R Five, sir. We have crew there. 
Twenty-eight men, four women.” 
“Can we move them?” 

“It’s your command, sir.” 

“Very well. Let me know when 
they’re dead.” 

“Yes, sir, Captain.” 

“Captain?” Weiss asked. “I 
think I have a radio signal. It’s 
UHF. Fourth quadrant, degree 
area one-seventeen. Thirteen, 
fourteen, fifteen— it’s at sixteen 
hours. Mass. Mass? It’s a planet, 
sir! Wait. There’s VHF. Dozen, 
there are dozens — there are hun- 
dreds of radio transmitters, sir. It’s 
an inhabited planet! An inhabited 
planet! It has intelligent life!” 



“Easy, son. Verify, please.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Chief. What’s our capacity to 
do sixteen hours?”^ 

“We could do it, sir. Cut off 
everything. We could do it. We’d 
get there four or five before critical 
mass. We’d be dry.” 

“Doctor?” 

“I’m checking it. Captain. Okay. 
Yes. It would take us up to one- 
fifty Fahrenheit — say fifty-five per 
cent mortality. Maybe down to fifty 
per cent if survivors can get liquids 
immediately on landing.” 
“Commander. Is there any 
record of an inhabited planet in this 
area?” 

“None, sir.” 

“Captain. General Rallfeld to 
speak to you, sir.” 

“One minute. Okay. Prepare for 
full propulsion power. You have a 
confirm on that, Weiss?” 

“Yes, sir. It’s absolute. It’s there. 
No mistake. Captain.” 

“All right. Prepare to go, 
gentlemen. We’re getting out.” 

I reached up for the phone. To an 
eight-star I spoke privately. 
“General. This is Captain Powers.” 
“I’d like to see you in my 
quarters. Captain.” 

“General. We’re in Emergency. 
We have just found an I planet at 
sixteen hours. I’m preparing to go 
for it. I don’t feel I can leave my 
command at this moment, sir.”

“I figured you’d find it. There’s 
no sense in your going toward that 
planet, Captain. Get down here. Go 
or don’t go on your fire command. 
It doesn’t matter. But get down 
here. I’ll explain when you do. That 
is an order.” 

“I don’t understand, sir. Do you 
advise against my firing?” 

“It doesn’t matter. Captain. 
Nothing is going to save this ship. 
Might as well go for it. But give 
your command and then get down 
here.” 

“Yes, sir,” I said. 

“Commander. Fire when you’re 
ready. If you need me I’ll be with 
the general.” 

Ben looked at me. I just shrug- 
ged. And I patted Weiss on his 
shoulder on the way out. I had a lot 
to live for. If there was any chance 
of living I was going to make it and 
my s1iip and my crew would make it 
with me.

Mark,” came over the audi- 
tory. “Three, two, one.” 

I held on for it. It was a quick 
burst, minimum added G. I waited 
for any after kick. There was none. 

It was damned hot down there in 
the passageway. I knocked. The 
general opened the door. His face 
was grim, taut. He was a lot of 
years my senior, one of the earliest 
patrollers, an almost legendary 



man. But he didn’t look old. He 
also didn’t look as if he were feeling 
the heat. Responsibility of com- 
mand goes deep. We were probably 
the only two men aboard still in full 
uniform, the only two aboard using 
all our will power to keep our sweat 
glands from betraying that we felt 
the heat, too. 

“General.” 

“Captain. Sit down. This / 
planet. From here it’s fourth quad- 
rant, degree one-seventeen?” he 
asked, going to hi^ table and 
looking down at a chart. 

“That’s correct, sir. May I ask 
how you know that?” 

“I’ve been following your 
progress. Captain. I would have 
come up and offered assistance if 
I’d known anything to help you. To 
the best of my knowledge and in the 
light of my experience 1 recom- 
mend that you cut off oxygen. Go 
black. Captain.” 

“We’re still alive, sir,” 

“This planet we are now heading 
toward. Captain — I was the first 
man to make contact with it.” 
“You’ve been there, sir? But — ” 
“Easy, Captain. It’^s not on charts 
because it was removed from them 
by command decision. As you ap- 
proach the planet, you have auto- 
matic gear that will signal nine. 
Condition nine.” 

“Nine means forbidden. Why, 
sir? And when? Why haven’t we

75 




gotten the signal by this time?” - 
” Because you’re not using 
enough power to get distant scan. 
As you near — on any degree of 
power— the nine signal will come 
up.” 

“But this is Emergency One, sir.” 
“What docs nine mean, Cap- 
tain?” 

“Approach forbidden under all 
circumstance, sir.” 

“Exactly. So what do you pro- 
pose to do?” 

“At this moment — with no al- 
ternative? I’ll land. General. If we 
can get there why not try it? It 
means dying there or here.” 

“I don’t think you will land. The 
planet we are approaching was once 
briefly list^ as Rallfeld. I thought 
I was the discoverer. I first made 
contact, I thought. I believed I was 
the first man who landed. The inha- 
bitants are a pretty extraordinary 
species, Captain. They have no 
form, none that I know. If they do 
they’ve never let us see it. The form 
they take is the sympathetic. If you 
were an elephant. Captain, you 
might find they all were elephants.” 
“They’ll wear our form for us?” 
“Yes. They can assume your 
form if they choose. Or they can 
assume the form of this starship or 
a fleet of starships. They could turn 
themselves into an army of pa- 
trollers. If that happened, in that 
army the brain duplication would 



have the imperative of getting 
home. Captain; getting back to 
Earth. Some of them, a million, ten 
million could turn themselves into 
weapons and then all it would take 
would be the move across space. 
You’ll have on your mind Extender. 
They’ll get to Extender. I think they 
are indestructable. Captain, and I 
know their only purpose is to 
destroy. What men once fantasied 
Mars was, what Sparta once was. 
Sir, this is the planet of war. And, 
Captain, if you land you will be 
risking the annihilation of Earth 
and perhaps of half the I planets in 
the universe.” 

“Butyou say that you landed.” 

<ilL7*ES. They were quiescent 
X then. Captain, things were 
different. I was just storming 
around, really an explorer, an ad- 
venturer more than a patroller. My 
orders were to go out to my fuel ca- 
pacity and then turn around and 
head back. We weren’t in trouble. 
We were in a normal mode. My 
chief spotted them. He yelled at me. 
Great excitement. Those days our 
contacts with other species — with I 
planets — were minimal and tre- 
mendously exciting. We were get- 
ting radio. We didn’t believe it. And 
it wasnH a simple signal. They were 
jamming up every one of the bands. 

“In those days our equipment 
was primitive, but we had equip-

ment. We tricked in on the signals 
and da go out to my fuel capacity 
and then turn around and head 
back. We weren’t in trouble. We 
were in a normal mode. My chief 
spotted them. He yelled at me. 
Great excitement. Those days our

“In those days our equipment

and damn if they weren’t coming 
from a planetary body. It was be- 
yond our safe-reserve fuel 
allotment — but hell, if we could get 
to it I wanted to do so. 

“So we moved for it. And we did 
a broad scan. You know how close 
the nearest star is. Captain? This is 
a true Lacuna. Hell, you can hardly 
see stars with your naked eye in this 
black. We searched. How the devil 
could you have a planet with a riot 
of radio coming from it — life on 
it — and no star? That didn’t make 
sense. Until that time our every 
contact had been with similar life 
forms with similar needs. We really 
believed we were the dominant 
species in the universe. Hell, you 
saw a Zithythin and you hardly 
could tell him from a Sw^e. Their 
planets were like ours, their life

to this planet and what the hell 
would they be?’’ 

He stopped and seemed to be re- 
membering. The cabin was hot. I 
wondered how much worse jt was 
than before we had gone on power. 
It felt worse.

the lingual transverter. We put it on 
the signals. It took a little time but 
it actually checked out. We were 
listening to disk jockeys and pop 
tunes. Just like home. A complex 
language. A language we would 
now classify as type N four-forty- 
one. Closest thing to it was 
Chinese, perhaps. 

“We kept probing. First thing we 
hit was that the Lacuna wasn’t al- 
ways that. At one time they had 
over four thousand stars around 
one massive one. Of the four thou- 
sand stars, at least fifteen hundred 
had planetary systems. Everyone of 
those stars. Captain, was dead. 
They were cinders, all burned out.’’

pened?’’

hundred and twenty-six hours after 
our first contact we went into a dis- 
tant orbit. From there we found no 
probes, no defenses, no electronic 
queries. They had radio but they 
were only using it for enter- 
tainment. Through our lingual 
transverter we sent down a query. 
We identified and requested per- 
. mission to land. This obviously was 
a sophisticated planet. We received 
no response. In the meantime we 
did standard electronic probing, 
made quite difficult by the 
darkness. We found electricity, but 
no light. We found heat but no fire. 
We found elaborate cities, quite 
large cities. There were bodies of 
water,Ngreat mountains. The planet 
is twice the size of ours. We later 
discovered it maintains a popula- 
tion of one point eight billion. 

“After repeated attempts to 
make contact or sense, we deter- 
mined — or more properly I did — to 
make our landing. It^vas something 
very special, Captain. We came 
down on a field outside one of their 
largest cities. With no sun there 
shouldn’t have been anything 
much-“but, Captain, we came 
down in paradise. Our lights 
showed flora so lavish and rich in 
colors so exotic that it exceeded the 
best we have on Earth. There was — 
and this is difficult to describe to a 
professional — a peace, a calm. The 
air was our air. The temperature 

78 



was balmy. A spring bubbled fifty 
yards from us and the water was 
pure. It was what Earth water 
probably was in the beginning. 
Beautiful, Captain. 

“No one came out to greet us. 
We waited, but no one came. We 
carried rovers in those days. In vio- 
lation of standing orders I relieved 
myself of command and with two of 
my men and our one semiportable 
transverter we drove into the city. 

iiTNCREDlBLE city. Captain. 

X All darkness. No windows 
on great buildings that soared be- 
yond anything we had even 
imagined on Earth — architectural 
forms fabricated of materials so 
beautiful that we stopped to stare 
at walls. Paved streets, no street 
lamps, gutters, drains. Sizes made 
us feel the natives must be bigger 
than we were, but not considerably 
bigger. There were no lamp posts, 
no other lighting forms or facilities. 
The darkness, except where our 
lights probed, was total. 

“We drove on. There were no ve- 
hicles in the streets. The streets 
were immaculate. Unbelievable 
place. Captain, absolutely unbe- 
lievable. There were no natives on 
the streets — we saw no animal life 
whatever. We kept going. Around 
every corner we discovered a new 
wonder. Then we reached the 
business section. Still no people,

which made us guess that it was 
perhaps their night. The stores had 
no display windows — you know 
what they had instead? They had 
radio and they had little boxes. The 
radio advertised — quietly it offered 
descriptions and prices. If you put 
your hands in the boxes you could 
feel the items or simulations of 
them. We were a little afraid but 
tried it. Difficult. If you’ve ever 
tried to identify even a familiar ob- 
ject in the darkness in one of those 
party games, you’ll know how dif- 
ficult it was — but totally fas- 
cinating, Captain. This feel thing — 
apparently they had even worked in 
out to replace movies. Feel a sound. 
They had no light. We had sensors 
and I swear to you we came up with 
zero photons. Nothing. Only our 
lights, our headlights, our spot- 
lights — old ruby lasers. 

“The place was — or seemed — 
deserted, abandoned. There was 
radio everywhere — even traffic con- 
trol, believe it or not — but we came 
up with nothing. Equipment primi- 
tive by your standards, but not un- 
sophisticated. 

“And then. Captain, right off a 
massive central square — our lights 
turned as we did and suddenly we 
had in them an image of me. It 
wasn’t quite perfect to my eyes. It 
was a slight variation, features co- 
pied but just perceptibly modified. 
But it was me. 



DRIVER called out: 
-lVX ‘Jesus.’ I told hirb to stop. 
I got out, holding my light on this 
doppelganger. I walked up to it 
slowly. It was dressed as I was with 
modifications, unfrightened as I 
was, curious as I was. 

“ ‘Bring over the transverter — 
slowly’ I called back to my men. 

“ ‘Not necessary, Captain,’ it 
said. It spoke our language even. 
Mister Powers. It even had that. 

“ ‘Who are you?’ 

“ ‘An official. I’m a guide in this 
instance. You are a patroller from 
the planet Earth. Please, would you 
lower your light to below my eyes. 
It is the first light I’ve ever seen. It 
has beauty but it is painful.’ 

“ ‘Sorry. We’re interested in 
you — your planet. We have contact 
with other species. We — ’ 

“ ‘I know. Captain. Let me 
quickly tell you our story. We are 
immortal. Yet we have births but 
maintain our population.’ 

“ ‘Mass deportations?’ 

“ ‘No. We are not a very old civi- 
lization. I, frankly, am not clear as 
to the nature or science of our full 
developmental story. We were 
primitives on a naked planet at 
about the same time your species 
lived in caves. And then one of us 
discovered. We had waters and 
naked rock, barren soil. Some 
visitor must have brought the 
fishes. We had fishes — we fished

them. One day while this ancestor 
was Fishing, knowing that his tribe 
had hunger, he was thinking 
strongly of fish. Suddenly he saw a 
fish and by a curious process he be- 
came a duplicate of that animal. He 
flopped to the ground — another 
tribesman grabbed him and he was 
eaten. But one of the tribe who had 
witnessed the transfiguration de- 
cided to investigate. 

“ ‘Apparently we had the capac- 
ity to adopt any form. However, the 
capacity was limited to one adop- 
tion. Some of us turned ourselves 
into rocks. When visitors came and 
taught us of trees and grass and ani- 
mals on their planets, some of us 
turned ourselves into those things. 
But most of us simply lived and 
grew and learned. 1 forget, that was 
in the time of the Great Light. Suns 
or stars were filling our skies. In 
those days there was never 
darkness. 

“ ‘Then it was simple. More and 
more advanced races came to visit. 
And suddenly our world exploded 
with new possibilities. They had 
radio, we — some of us — became 
transmitters and others receivers. 
They had images of their cities. 
Some of us were drawn by those 
images and turned ourselves into 
the buildings and streets — enough. 
Captain, so that we had cities. 
Perhaps you chose to be a great 
building forever — or if you thought 



ill of yourself, maybe you became a 
gutter. Think of it. Everything you 
see, you have seen, was once one of 
us.’ 

“‘What happened then?’ I 
asked this copy of myself. 

“ ‘By copying we assimilated 
many elements of many civiliza- 
tions. From primitivism we became 
advanced. It all happened quickly. 
Four thousand of you years ago we 
were peasants. Three thousand six 
hundred of your years ago we had 
become the most advanced civiliza- 
tion in the universe. We even visited 
your planet. Funny stories of that. 
One day I must tell you.’ 

“‘Whatever you want to tell 
me,’ I said. 

“ ‘Perhaps I should tell first of a 
very handsome speicies of very dis- 
tant visitors who came to us. They 
were having some difficulty with 
their population and they con- 
sidered our planet suitable for their 
colonial needs. So they came in 
great numbers, bent on conquest. It 
was very impressive to us. Prior to 
this we had had no knowledge of 
war. Suddenly, Captain, almost all 
of us wanted to be warriors. We be- 
came them. We had no logistic pro- 
blems as they did, but we had all 
their knowledge and skills and tech- 
nology. We quickly defeated them 
in a bloody battle that only was too 
short — and with our warriors’ 
hunger we felt compelled to go on. 



80 



IF 




We went off, Captain, to conquer 
the universe. We were mostly war- 
riors, what else was there to do?’ 

“ The universe is vast. Please 
lower that light. Captain. It pains 
my eyes — they are greatly atrop- 
hied after three thousand years of 
darkness. We conquered and con- 
quered — planet after planet fell to 
us. We were mighty, powerful, 
ruthless. Too much so, it seems. 
The other planets, the ones we had 
not yet destroyed, for the first time 
came into a confederation for the 
specific purpose of acting against 
us. In one great sweep — while 
most of our >\arriors wefe off at 
wars — they came and burned out 
our stars and destroyed those of us 
who were weapons and eradicated 
every source of light. Remember, 
we can only copy. They destroyed 
all our sources of light and with no 
model we had no new capacity to 
make light, even to make fire. Their 
purpose was to kill us, of course. 
How could life exist without some 
of the products of light? But enough 
of us had not yet committed our- 
selves to a modification. We still 
had our adaptability. We became 
creatures of darkness — even those 
of us who chose to be plants — 
food — soon became indestructible 
plants — immortal. Don’t ask me 
how. Immortality is basic to our 
species — it is the one thing we have. 
Our children have the capacity to 



change as I have changed to copy 
your image.’ 

“ ‘You’ll always be my image?’ 

“ ‘Yes.’ 

“ ‘Can others become you, be- 
come my image?’ 

“ ‘Only from the original. Cap- 
tain. There is infinite allowance of 
duplication from the original.’ 

“ ‘You are no longer a warrior 
race?’ 

“ ‘That is difficult to say. It is 
part of our genetic heritage. Given 
freedom to move and be and given 
sight — who knows what we might 
be again.’ 

“ ‘The light went out three thou- 
sand years ago?’ 

“ ‘That is correct, Captain.’ 

“ ‘And you’ve just maintained 
yourselves in this darkness in a rela- 
tively quiescent state?’ 

“ ‘We are noted for our 
perseverance. We always go on. 
The stores you have passed, the 
radio you have heard they go back 
to the days of light or the period be- 
fore the lack of light forced modifi- 
cation. For three thousand six 
hundred years it has been as you see 
it. We have survived. We have 
waited.’ 



ii \Y/ ELL, Powers, that was it. 

W We thanked him. He 
urged us not to rush off. We said 
that we had to, but we would report

and we certainly expected to send 
back a full Sci-Explor Team. He 
said that he and his people would 
look forward to that. And then we 
left.” 

“They have water there?” I asked 
the general. 

“You are being obtuse. Perhaps 
it’s the heat. Yes, of course they 
have water. But we never went 
back. No scientiHc team visited 
them. They are strictly a prohibited 
planet. They are rated a prime 
menace. They are just waiting to 
copy from anyone — to copy enough 
so that they can go out and conquer 
again.” 

“How can you know that, 
General?” 

“Restricted File Nine-A-four.” 

“That’s an ancient history file.” 

" “Yes. These beings have the ca- 
pacity to become invincible. For the 
sake of all I planets in- these 
galaxies, for the sake of Earth, I am 
sorry — but I must forbid you to 
land.” ^ 

“We need liquids or we will die. 
General.” 

“Eight hundred and twenty-seven 
on this ship — how many billions out 
there? I recommend. Captain, that 
you shut off oxygen. Death will be 
swift and painless. I further recom- 
mend that you aim your ship at the 
planet and time it for full fusion im- 
pact. These creatures are an abomi- 
nation.” 



“My responsibility is to this ship 
and to my crew.” 

“Like hell it is. Captain. Your 
responsibility is considerably 
greater than that.” 

“Very well. General. Thank you 
for telling me this. I’ll take it under 
advisement.” 

“I’ll iake command. You are 
relieved. Captain.” 

“No, General It’s my ship. Con- 
sider yourself confined to 
quarters,” I told him and stalked 
out. 

N othing new to report as I 
resumed my command. Tem- 
perature was 135°F. Revised esti- 
mates indicated ship mortality 
would be 19% at 140°F. Ship pro- 
ceding on course with minimal 
power utilization. Crew resting, in 
position. Command room filled 
with nudists. The very attractive 
flight officer Duncan wore only a 
cache sex. It was largely sweated 
through and transparent. Duncan 
was the one beauty on the ship. 
Every man had hoped from the 
outset to establish a relationship 
with her. She had proved stiff, de- 
void of humor, uninterested in 
semal pursuits, painfully modest 
^no totally untouchable. I watched 
bead of perspiration roll down the 
valley between her high breasts. I 
found I had not enough juices to be 
aroused. No other crewman or of- 



82 



IF 




ficer on the deck seemed even 
aware of her nudity. 

We just sat, too tired and ener- 
vated to speak. We waited. We 
watched the clock. We watched the 
thermometer slowly inch up. We 
listened to the brief reports of new 
compartments reaching Thermal 
Accelerate Lethal. And we wasted 
away. Our freeze-dried foods had 
no liquids in them, there was not 
even frost to lick. We had no liquids 
in us — not any more. We fasted. 
And every half-hour we got the 
time check, the ETA to our planet, 
to the general’s planet: Rallfeld: 

G etting hard to breathe. The 
nasal passages burn, they feel 
all wrong, unnatural. We’re three 
from Rallfeld — call it that. 1 an- 
nounced it to the crew as if it meant 
something. The doctor says it just 
had to be something for them to 
hang on to. A number. Our voices 
croak when we speak. My throat 
feels as if it’s going to hemorrhage. 
The worst thing is the building 
headache. No one is sweating any 
more. That’s over. Four crewmen 
and the .major are down. I’ve just 
left them. 1 don’t have the strength 
to move them — I doubt that anyone 
else has. They’re just down where 
they fell, a reproach to me, a re- 
minder of our imminent fate to the 
others. 

Temperature is now 142®. I’m 



trying to guess at what temperature 
our instruments will start going out, 
though I know that most of them 
will certainly outlast us. 1 keep 
wondering whether it isn’t worth 
the risk to open primary or at least 
secondary approach procedures just 
to have some reference if the heat 
does knock essential equipment out 
of function. But if I use that power 
now, knowing that I’m obligated to 
use full power on j-eal approach, 
how many more men will I kill? 

God! It’s a great ship, an extraor- 
dinarily fine entrustment of com- 
mand. But with the trust I have 
responsibility. 

What do I do? 

Rallfeld has to be judged ra- 
tional. He seemed rational when he 
told the story. I believed his ex- 
perience. But belief isn’t enough, 
not with command. 

The override gauge, the supreme 
command center counter, even 
without power is reading Condition 
9. That means they must have a 
satellitp'system and their transmit- 
ters must have max power. 

9 means off limits. Going into the 
mushrooms of a nuclear war they 
only send out a 7. Nine means it. If 
I land and get away with it — if I 
save the ship and my crew — if I get 
back alive with no damage done 
they will still lock me up for life. 
The penalty is automatic. There are 
no exceptions.

But how could they know? If I 
pull it off, how would they know? If 
the planet is twice the size of our 
Earth with only a fraction of 
Earth’s population certainly there 
has to be one place sparsely popu- 
lated. It’s dark perpetually. We 
could go in, get the water in fast 
and get the hell off. And then 1 
could claim I didn’t know anything, 
didn’t know where the hell I was, 
was too irrational in a heat stroke 
to even be aware of 9. 

Temperature is 145®. We’re now 
38% down — we’ve stopped counting 
cortex burnouts. It’s bad. I don’t 
understand how I’m still making it. 

Eighty-two minutes from the 
planet. Difficult to swallow the 
stimulants — effects are erratic and 
lunatic. 

As long as they are blind or al- 
most blind, as long as all is 
darkness below — as long as they 
don’t have light we have to be fairly 
safe. If we actually encountered 
them, how many would there be? 
We could go out fully armed, kill 
everything. The only real danger 
would be if they captured one of us. 
Say one sees us, or a dozen, or a 
hundred, or a thousand. As long as 
they can’t hold us for endless repli- 
cations, what can they do? They 
can’t take" reproductions from each 
other. With maximum urgency, 
with every facility at our command, 
we can get the water and get out. 



Even if they somehow took ten 
thousand of us-— what would ten 
thousand mean against all the 
power of the Patrollers? No threat, 
no serious threat. Speed is the only 
issue, the single issue. ^ 

Seventy-five minutes. I’ll turn on 
approach at fifteen, not before. 
And even that is premature and 
very late. 

The doctor just fell. He was a 
good friend. 

Do 1 explain again chain of com- 
mand? No. They know. If I don’t 
make it they’ll handle it. They’re a 
fine crew. 

“We’re at two hundred and five 
degrees Fahrenheit, Captain,” the 
chief said. 



I HAD to think before realizing 
he was talking about P 4. We 
had six degrees before we blew up. I 
made my mind stop thinking of 
what was happening in the reactor, 
how many millions of degrees were 
getting ready to burst out of it. 
Twenty-eight minutes. Question is 
whether to wait on approach power. 

I tried to think. “We’ll go into 
approach at four minutes. Power at 
four and a half. Can you handle it 
that quickly?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“All right. Now listen. We’re 
going to have damn little chance to 
pick and choose our site. We want

water and we want to be as far from 
any habitation as possible. No 
contact. When we get in: full armed 
section, manual total annihilate. 
The men must keep together. Hoses 
and fast-as-possible loading.” 

“It’ll take us time to cool.” 

“Okay. Then land, sit tight,* but- 
toned up. We wait, then out and 
fast load.” 

“Life support?” 

“Not necessary. There is oxygen 
compatible atmosphere.” If we’re 
battened down and just sit on the 
surface, even with time, what the 
hell can they do to us? They might 
duplicate our ship but what about 
our interior? What good would the 
ship be without our interior, 
without us, without our operating 
knowledge? No. They won’t be able 
to touch us. 

Temperature fierce. It’s difficult 
to think, to move. Twelve minutes. 
Maybe I’ll go down in history as 
the greatest traitor, but I’m not 
going to sit here and die. I’m not 
going to surrender my command to 
death. 

I’m even thinking in a whisper. 

“So you’re going ahead. Cap- 
tain,” a strong, natural voice. I 
turned painfully, slowly. It was the 
general. He was fully uniformed. 
He wasn’t sweating. He didn’t look 
weakened. He stood there. 

“1 ordered you confined to your 
quarters, General.” 



“Poor Captain Powers. You have 
decided to go in, haven’t you?” 

“Yes, General. It’s a risk that I 
must take.” 

“Very well. Just do not forget 
that I did my best to warn you. I 
tried to stop you.” 

“Yes. I understand. When we get 
back to Extender, I’ll place myself 
under arrest, sir.” 

“Do you mind if I stay up and 
watch the landing? It’s sort of 
coming home, you know?” 

“Do what you please. Just don’t 
interfere, sir.” 

“Tell me this. Captain. As I 
understand the new propulsion 
technology, a simple weld and a vis- 
cuous fluid would fix up your ship 
to perfection. Is that correct?” 
“That’s all. General. Just that.” 
“Good. I’ll just get out of your 
way, unless you should want me to 
help.” 

“How is it you still have your 
voice, your strength?” 
“Constitution, 1 suppose. Cap- 
tain.” He smiled. 

Temperature up to 151°F. One-

In a great flash the screen lit. We 
had U-V on, dark probe. It is

Another body of water. Yes. Looks 
sparsely populated. Good. No

Those are lights. Where did they 
get them? How? 

Going in fast. Strong gravity pull. 
Three minutes. Nothing else left 
Abort attempt now would take us 
into fusion. Up to 208°F in P 4. Our 
temperature is 157°. Just coming in 
now. Nothing to it. Just steady in. 

“Where the hell did they get 
those lights?” 

LEFT a few things behind, 
X Captain. The rover. I guess 
they must have replicated that like 
crazy. That laser spot, those head- 
lights.” 

“Coming in. Captain. Thirty-five 
seconds.” 

We’re going to make it. 

“Down! Down! We’re down!” 
“Shut off — everything off!” 
“Well, you made it. Captain. 
Congratulations.” 

“Yes. Why didn’t you tell me 
that you’d left them light?” 

“Call it dual loyalties. I’m 
taking over command of this ship, 
now. Captain.” 

“Why now?” 

“We’re here is why. You and 
your crew may consider yourselves 
prisoners of war. If I have any in- 
fluence I’ll try to persuade my 
people to treat you according to the 
Interplanetary Convention.” 

“You are — ” I tried to get it out, 
couldn’t. My tongue was swollen. 
“Sabotage?” 



“The heat really slowed up your 
thinking. Captain. The story about 
the first visit to the planet is quite 
true. Just the one now obvious 
slight omission. Come with me. 
Captain. Here. I’ll help you.” 

“No.” 

“Oh, yes. I tried to save you. I’ve 
admired your species. But I do have 
my loyalties, you know.’’ 

“No.” 

“Yes, Captain. You needn’t be 
worried about your life, not for a 
good long time.” He walked over to 
me and just lifted me in his arms. 1 
wanted to fight but I was too feeble. 
He was an old man but he just 
picked me up and carried me. We 
went down ship, my ship. 1 de- 
sperately wanted to fight him, kill 
him, get to the controls. I had to get 
us to fusion. But I couldn’t even lift 
my arms. 

Crew fallen away, dead littering

We reached the hatch. 

I knew what awaited me even be- 
fore it opened.

a long low hill. The slope to her 
anterior portion was almost identi- 
cal to that of her posterior — 
gradual and not at all precipitous. 
Her mouth, an efficient grazer’s 
mouth, was hidden by the anterior 
part of her body and pointed 
straight down over the vegetation 
that formed her diet. 

Armored over her entire length, 
she normally had nothing to fear at 
this latitude. Occasionally the 
vespertosauri would get this far, 
but they were a minor hazard at 
worst. No projection thrust itself 
from her profile — even her eyes 
were sunk beneath several layers of 
armor, massive eyelids that opened 
only when vibration gave a warn- 
ing — for even to a teratohippus 
the powerful winds of the region 
were a danger. 

She was well adapted to her 
environment. A masterpiece of 
Betulian evolution. As the official 
guidebook put it: 

Teratohippus ectostia — one 
of the wonders of Betul’s fauna, 
this huge beast is a harmless 
grazer inhabiting the polar 
reaches of the planet and sur- 
viving on otherwise inedible 
plant life there. Little is known 
of its physiology or behavior 
because of the difficulties of 
conducting research in the bar- 
ren reaches of its habitat. 



Although the creature is com- 
paratively rare, you may be 
able to observe one grazing as 
you pass over the northern 
tundras on your way to the 
Ferris Observatory . 

AS THE skimmer passed over 
Jl\, perhaps the thousandth 
frozen rill — this one looking exactly 
like the others — Millie went back 
to her guidebook (itself not very 
thrilling) and wondered when the 
trip over the desolation would end. 
She had been told the journey to 
the Betulian pole would last “all 
day” and had been unable to imag- 
ine what the term could mean on 
a planet with a much longer day 
than Earth’s — and on a course that 
followed the sun on its journey. It 
was still broad daylight. Eight 
hours had passed and the pilot — 
Captain Chamberlan — had just 
announced they were six hours 
away from Ferris. 

Only five passengers were on 
board. The others were her Project 
Chief Dr. Jens Hiacint and the 
team’s documentarian, Henry 
Dalmat, plus two astrohistorians 
from the Grand University of 
Tufts, Earth’s leading institute for 
interplanetary archivalism. She 
had not caught the names of the 
last two (she thought one was 
named Smith) and they hadn’t 
tried hard to get acquainted.

Archivalists generally looked 
down on the sciences she and her 
two colleagues represented. Alien 
biology was still a fairly new field 
and only a few schools, such as 
their University of Wayland, 
dabbled in it. Earth was still hung 
up on history, she thought, because 
of its economic value in settling 
legal claims of possession. She 
supposed interplanetary law — with 
its attendant fields, archivalism and 
power theory — was important. 
(Earth was of value now only as a 
receptacle of documents and as an 
arbiter of dispute.) But she wished 
they would recognize the impor- 
tance of other — less pragmatic — 
sciences as well. 

None of the passengers were 
“tourists,” of course, because no 
ordinary citizen could afford the 
immense costs of visiting another 
solar system and its developing 
planet. They were, like most 
visitors to Betul, Earthling scient- 
ists sponsored by wealthy universi- 
ties on a mission intended to add to 
that vast repository of information 
that was the parent planet. 

When Millie spotted the dark 
object on the horizon she im- 
mediately remembered the item 
in her guidebook. She turned back 
a few pages and read the meager 
information on teratohippus. She 
nudged Dr. Hiacint and pointed 
out the beast. He had been dozing 



but became instantly alert. Hia- 
cint was a leading alien biologist, 
head of her department. He 
grabbed his binoculars and leaned 
against the porthole as he examined 
the strange beast. 

“God, what I’d give to be able 
to look at it up close.” His gray 
head was quivering with excite- 
ment. 

“May I use your glasses a min- 
ute?” Millie was a teracist and 
this animal was a classic example 
in her specialty. He handed over 
the binoculars with overt reluc- 
tance. She looked closely at the 
mountainous creature and mar- 
veled at how it could get enough 
sustenance in these barren wastes. 

Her excitement was perhaps 
greater than his. “I wonder if we 
could manage an opportunity to 
study it while we are here?” She 
looked questioningly at Hiacint. 

Behind her she heard a snicker. 
One of the astrohistorians (the one 
named Smith?) had his head 
buried in a vital statistics record 
from Ferris — he was deliberately 
ignoring the beast on the tundra. 

“You could never last out there. 
Miss Verd,” he said. “I under- 
stand the temperature approaches 
absolute zero when darkness 
falls.” 

“And how do you know so 
much?” 

He gestured at his book. “I’ve 



TERATOHIPPUS

been reading about attempts to 
reach and study that creature. Sur- 
vival down there is almost impos- 
sible for humans. No one has ever 
lived through an attempt to travel 
the tundra on the surface. A team 
of three biologists died a few years 
ago near here while trying to ob- 
serve a teratohippus or whatever 
you call them. It says here that — ” 
“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped. “1 
don’t have time to waste right 
now.” She looked back at the 
animal, was alarmed to see that 
the skimmer was almost directly 
above it. She pressed her face 
against the port. “Does it seem to 
be moving?” she asked Dr. Hiacint. 

“I can’t see anything resembling 
movement. But we don’t know yet 
what is under all that armor. It 
could be feeding — or doing any 
number of things down there.” 
“Professor, isn’t there equip- 
ment for survival in that type of 
environment?” 

“Of course there’s equipment,” 
the astrohistorian butted in. “But 
it has limitations, mainly on the 
length of time you can stay out 
there, but also on the size and 
sophistication required for your 
type of studies.” 

She told him petulantly, “I 
didn’t ask you, Mr. Smith.” 

It was then that she felt the 
barely perceptible, but different, 
vibration in the skimmer. The 



others sensed it, too, to judge by 
their expressions. She looked out 
through the porthole and saw the 
surface approaching. 

“My God. We’re going down.” 

/ 

S TEF CHAM BEL AN, a cap- 
tain in the Visitor’s Transpor- 
tation Section, had been cursing 
his boredom and wondering why 
he had volunteered for the job. 
The Exploratory Corps needed the 
money brought in by visitors, of 
course, and someone had to tend 
to them . but, he thought, why 
me? He always reached this stage 
about halfway across these barren 
deserts between Base and Ferris. 
The ship nearly flew itself and he 
could hardly keep from dozing. 
But he couldn’t afford to give in. 
His passengers might be looking at 
him — their entire crew — and lose 
faith. But he was yawning when it 
happened. 

The shudder was caused by a 
lack of power. He quickly switched 
off the reactor, which showed an 
unaccountable and dangerous 
temperature. Auxiliary power 
came on immediately and auto- 
matically, but the shuddering did 
not cease. He glanced at the gauge 
and realized there was simply not 
enough energy on board to keep 
the craft flying. 

The ship gave a series of violent 
jerks. The engines deprived of 



90 



IF 




their customary load, were strain- 
ing. He switched all he had into 
the landing mode and the skin>mer 
calmed down a bit. He programed 
immediate touchdown procedures 
and punched the Mayday indicator. 

Another serious shockwave 
shook the small ship and he 
switched off the signal. There was 
just enough energy now, to keep 
the ship in landing mode. It was 
settling slowly to the surface, 
shuddering slightly. 

“Crash positions,” he yelled to 
his passengers, afraid even to use 
the intercom. Over his shoulder 
he saw his charges folding their 
seats back to reclining position. 
Then the shudder became a gasp. 
He manually overrode the landing 
mode and speeded up the descent. 
At about fifteen meters the power 
went out completely. 

The frozen, powdery, mold-like 
life on the tundra — the basic food 
of the teratohippus — saved their 
lives as the ship plummeted to the 
surface. 

W HEN she felt the first shock 
— which felt something like 
a vespertosaur mounting its attack- 
ing dive — she started to close up 
all her defenses and prepare for an 
attack. But being the slow, deli- 
berate creature she was, she elected 
to wait and analyze the. vibrations 
a little longer. 



They were coming from almost 
overhead and they seemed to her 
more like the stragglings of some 
small dying creature than the 
threatening dive of a predator. 

She felt the shock of the craft 
crashing somewhere behind her 
and her multiple olfactors recog- 
nized the slight scent of a plenti- 
tude of food at the point of impact. 
The silence following the shock 
convinced her that no danger dwelt 
in the little creature that just died. 

The rich odor of food was tempt- 
ing, but she could not afford to 
turn about for it. Ahead, many 
days ahead, was her nest with her 
young — now in hibernation — who 
would require her milk soon. She 
was two-thirds of the way through 
her circle. She could not stop now. 

Her brain blotted out the mem- 
ory of the strange dying creature 
that flew and programed itself for 
the critical days ahead when time — 
she thought — would be her greatest 
enemy. 

W HEN Chambelan came to 
(he must have been uncon- 
scious only a minute or two) he 
was amazed they were all still 
alive. The skimmer had not been 
designed to take that hard a fall and 
— with total loss of power — the 
life-support systems should have 
failed, too. 

He checked over the systems 



TERATOHIPPUS 



91 




before he even checked on the 
passengers. Life support was 
functioning — partially — on stored 
power sources that were indepen- 
dent of all other systems. They 
had perhaps eight hours to go. 
Communications systems were 
dead, destroyed on impact. All 
locomotive systems were out. What 
he had left were a few scanning 
systems. It didn’t look good. 

He made his way back through 
the debris to check on the pas- 
sengers. 

“Everyone okay?” 

“Yes, I think so.” The speaker 
was Hiacint, who had pretty well 
taken over direction of the party. 
“What I don’t understand is — with 
the damage to all the equipment — 
why weren’t we all injured?” 

“That’s easy to explain, sir,” 
Chambelan said after a minute’s 
thought. “Those cabin seats were 
salvaged from the interplanetary 
ship that brought our first team to 
Betul. They were designed to 
protect passengers from much 
greater impacts than this. What 
really surprises me is why the shell 
to this skimmer didn’t fracture. 
With no breathable oxygen and as 
flimsily dressed as we are, we could 
have had no injuries and could still 
have died in seconds.” 

Dr. Hiacint had a small instru- 
ment in his hands. “While you 
were busy up front I was examining 



the powdery substance that we 
landed in. We seem to have hit a 
colony of a supercold one-celled 
life. It seems to have a depth of 
several meters. The ship’s fall was 
broken by the colony’s bulk. Now 
we have ‘floated’ to the top of the 
mass — probably a group rejection 
of an alien substance.” 

“What is that gadget?” 

“It’s a bioscanner. I took my 
reading through the porthole and 
analyzed it with my portable 
Prolyzer, The colony seems to be 
moldlike — ” 

“Mold?” 

“Yes, you might say a giant 
supercold mushroom saved our 
lives.” 

“That’s all very interesting, but 
when are we going to be rescued?” 
The speaker was Michael Peripet, 
leader of the Initial Archivalist 
Documentation Team. 

Chambelan took a deep breath. 
“I don’t really know if we are going 
to be rescued. I was only able to 
broadcast Mayday for a few sec- 
onds. I had a choice of broadcast- 
ing or crashing. 1 chose to land 
safely. It is doubtful that anyone 
heard our Mayday.” 

“Why aren’t you sending out a 
message now?” 

“Because our communications 
are shot. Besides, we don’t have 
the power even if we could repair 
the equipment.” 



92 



IF 




“We have power to keep this ship 
warm. Why don’t we have enough 
to send out a message?” 

“You don’t seem to appreciate 
the tremendous energy required 
for communication on a planet 
this size. We are somewhere in the 
middle of a vast area that com- 
prises one-third of Betul. Betul is 
about three-fifths the size of the 
planet Jupiter. Line-of-sight com- 
munications — the most economical 
— are impossible. Our only means 
of reaching either Base or Ferris 
Observatory is by planetary modu- 
lation and this requires a great deal 
more than we have available.” 
“Surely they’ll miss our flight 
and come looking for us,” Dr. 
Verd asked, “won’t they?” 

“I’m sure they will. But by the 
time we’re missed at Ferris — about 
six hours from now — our present 
power supplies will be almost ex- 
hausted. As I said earlier, we won’t 
last more than a few seconds once 
our life-support system fails.” 
Peripet was looking through the 
porthole at the bleak tundra of 
Betul. “What a place to die.” 
Chambelan felt a little embar- 
rassed. He was responsible for the 
safety of these people, but there 
really wasn’t anything he could do. 
“I think I’ll go up front and see if 
I can salvage some communica- 
tions gear. It’s our only hope. 
Maybe a scout ship will be in the 



area for normal, IjNifi-of-sight 
communications.” As he turned 
to leave he knew there was no hope 
of the last. Scout ships seldom 
came to this area. All personnel 
were busy building the new closed 
city at Estrodome, on the far side 
of Betul. But he had to keep up a 
good front. 

The rest stared with Peripet 
through the ports at the forbidding 
spot that would probably become 
their tomb. 

II 

T he captain had been busy for 
more than a hour in the cabin 
up front. He didn’t seem to be 
having much luck. The archivalists 
had withdrawn inco themselves and 
were still staring out. Good old 
Dalmat was busy recording every- 
thing — particularly the evidence 
on the mold culture that had 
broken their fall — for future gener- 
ations. Dr. Hiacint was running 
more tests and feeding them to 
Dalmat. They were both good 
scientists — Millie thought it a 
shame to see them die like this. 

She was still /thinking about the 
teratohippus, about survival, about 
things that were and ought to be. 

“Professor,” she said Tinally, 
“I’ve been wondering about some- 
thing. Our biggest problem now is 
centered around the need for heat.” 



TERATOHIPPUS 



93 




“Yes, I’ve had that on my mind, 
too. We seem to have food supplies 
and oxygen for several days, but a 
source of energy great enough to 
protect us from the intense cold 
here is our greatest need.” 

“Is there any way of searching 
this area for a source of heat? 1 was 
thinking of the teratohippus. If it 
survives and is able to move that 
huge bulk— musn’t it generate 
large amounts of heat?” 

“It should.” Professor Hiacint 
was thinking. He turned toward the 
cabin where the captain was work- 
ing. “Chambelan,” he called, “do 
you have a functioning infrared 
scanner?” 

“Yes, among other scanning 
equipment. But I have no equip- 
ment for analysis.” 

“We can use my Prolyzer, which 
is still operative. Let’s scan the 
area for heat sources.” 

“What good will that do us?” 
“Perhaps none. But what harm 
will it do?” 

Millie had the Prolyzer in hand 
and was moving toward the cabin. 
Hiacint gathered up some mate- 
rials and followed her. He con- 
nected his data-plotter onto the 
ship’s infrared scanner and Cham- 
belan started a sweep. 

His first effort revealed no heat 
sources at all, nothing within sight 
even near survival levels for human 
beings. 



“Tighten the scanning,” Millie 
told them. “Bring it in on the' 
Teratohippus itself. If there’s any 
heat source out there capable of 
being of value to us it must be in a 
creature the size of that thing.” 
Chambelan tuned the instru- 
ment to tight scan and manually 
aimed the fountenna at the crea- 
ture, while both Millie and Hiacint 
leaned over the Prolyzer — which 
Hiacint had programed for direct 
image response on the screen. 

At first nothing appeared. The 
professor punched in a more sensi- 
tive response and slowly an image 
came on the screen — a bluish tinge 
showed on a field of gray. “The 
heat level on the creature’s dermis 
is far belqw survival level for us, 
about forty degrees below freez- 
ing."” A frown and a shrug showrf 
Hiacint’s disappointment. 

“Wait, Professor!” Millie was 
looking closely at the screen, 
where a tiny green speck appeared. 
“Look there.” Then: “Captain, 
would you try to take the scan in 
even closer — onto that spot?” 
Chambelan tightened the scan 
even more and guided the external 
fountenna as best as he could. As 
he gingerly inched the level for- 
ward the green dot became a large 
area of brilliant green in a yellow 
field. 

Hiacint punched madly onto the 
control board. “Millie, you’ve 



94 



IF 




found it. There seems to be . an 
aperture in this creature with 
temperatures suitable for the 
support of human life. The aper- 
ture itself is barely large enough for 
a human, but — ” ^ 

“But it could lead to something 
larger,” Millie was earnest. 

“But why^do you think so? 
asked Chambelan. 

“Ah, that’s Miss Verd’s spe- 
cialty,” Hiacint replied. “She 
pioneered the field of teracial 
biology by finding similar types of 
creature on other planets. She can 
probably explain better than I.” 
They both turned to Millie. 

“This life-form undoubtedly 
belongs to the class known as 
Teraciae. They are all large ani- 
mals, exoskeletal and usually 
warm-blooded, which have adapted 
to extremely cold environments on 
once-warm worlds. The external 
skeleton is a primary evolutionary 
tool for their survival and generally 
includes a cavity of varying size for 
the purpose of air intake — a breath- 
ing chamber, /US it were.” 

“But why a cavity?” 

“Because the creature’s breath- 
ing apparatus is still attuned to its 
warmer existence. The cavity al- 
lows the external air to be warmed 
up before it enters the animal’s 
lungs. I was only guessing, but I 
supposed this creature to be like 
others I’ve studied.” 



Professor to 

Chambelan. “Do any 

means of leaving this shipt” 

“Yes, there are suits aboard for 
limited use outside. They contain 
enough fuel to provide warmth for 
about an hour — but certainly not 
enough for a trip to the creature 
and back.” 

“But enough,” Millie asked, “to 
reach the teratohippus?” 

“I think so.” 

“Then one of us must go out and 
see if we can use it for survival.” 

Chambelan got up. “I guess Vd 
better go. There’s a good chance 
that whoever goes won’t come 
back.” 

“But you wouldn’t know what to 
look for.” Millie turned to the 
professor. “Would he?” Hiacint 
started to open his mouth, but 
Millie cut him off. “So you see, 
Captain, I really must be the one 
to go.” 

“But you’re the only wo — ” 
Hiacint’s warning glance directed 
Chambelan’s attention to the 
growing choler on Millie’s face. 
He felt a little foolish, but he 
nodded reluctantly. “Yes.” 

ii "V7*OU know, my name really 
X isn’t Smith.” 

Millie stopped putting on her 
EV suit and looked up in surprise. 

“Did 1 ever say it was?” 

“Yes, just before the accident or 



TERATOHIPPUS 



95 




whatever it was. 1 believe I was 
teasing you a bit and — ” 

“Teasing? You were being down- 
right nasty.” 

“I suppose I was. I’d like vto 
apologize.” 

She finished inserting herself 
into the rather flimsy suit and was 
testing the bulky heating unit she 
would wear on her back. “That’s 
all right. I’d really forgotten about 
it.” He seemed a little embarrassed. 
“By the way, what is your name?” 
“It’s Smirg, Evan Smirg. I’m the 
vivistorian with the team.” 

She looked a little puzzled. The 
word was new to her. You never 
knew what gimmick the archi- 
valists would come up with in order 
to grab more responsibility in 
interspace affairs. She started to 
set on her helmet when he caught 
her hand. 

“Wait. What I really want to 
say is that I think I should take 
your place and go out there.” 

She lowered the helmet. “Why?” 
“Well — first, I’m probably the 
least capable of aiding the group in 
a survival situation. And second, I 
don’t think a woman should take 
such a risk. 1 think — ” 

When the rest of the group got 
there, Smirg was nursing a sore 
eye, trying to stop the flow of blood 
from his nose and choking back a 
chuckle. Millie had closed the air- 
lock’s inner door and was grinning 



triumphantly through the viewport. 

In another instant she was out- 
side, alone in the forbidding 
atmosphere of Betul. 

I N THE Betulian biosystem the 
teratohippus is of only minor 
importance, but it does contribute. 
It is one (certainly the largest) of 
a number of grazers descended 
from sea dwellers of eons ago when 
Betul was a planet of tropical 
waters. 

The lowest order of life in these 
reaches is the moldlike mycoplank- 
ton. This is composed of unicellular 
life, most of it capable of convert- 
ing the frozen water and carbon 
dioxide and suspended minerals 
into proteoids. Other members of 
the plankton live off the majority 
and are called simply proteophages. 

As the mycoplankton migrate 
through and over the glacistrata 
in search of minerals they provide 
food for the grazers. The grazers 
in turn are food for the teeming 
populations of the moderate 
zones, which invade the tundras 
during the brief “summer” period. 

The circle is completed when the 
wastes and decaying bodies of the 
teratohippus, and of the hunters 
who die during summer forages, 
supply a continuous source of 
minerals for the mycoplankton. 

The teratohippus thus is only 
ope link in the vast food chain of 



96 



IF 




the northern tundras which is so 
important in maintaining the 
seemingly overpopulated animal 
and plant existence of the Betulian 
equatorial regions. Or rather, a 
portion of a link — expendable from 
a purely systems viewpoint. 

i^TJROFESSOR HIACINT, 
Xcan you hear me?” 

“Yes, Dr. Verd, Your transmis- 
sion is coming in clearly. Where 
are you now?” 

“I’m in the cavity. It’s extra- 
ordinarily large. Larger than any 
such we’ve seen before. Big enough 
to shelter all of us.” 

Millie rubbed her right hand as 
she looked around. Her knuckles 
were slightly tender from hitting 
the impertinent Dr. Smirg. Maybe 
I shouldn't have, she thought, but 
he deserved it. 

The chamber was arched, about 
forty meters high in the center. 
It widened abruptly as one came 
in through the tiny aperture and ex- 
tended about twelve or thirteen 
meters along the creature’s dor- 
sum until it narrowed again into a 
series of pulsating holds that she 
took to be air-intake pipes — 
nostrils. 

The material of the walls and 
bottom seemed to be similar to the 
skeletal armor outside. It was 
hard and only porous enough for 
heat transfer. Where the sides 



sloped down and met the “floor” 
lay a strange phenomenon, some- 
thing she had not seen in any other 
teraciae. The hard skeletal mate- 
rial gave way almost at the corner 
and became gray, fleshy. With her 
light she was able to make out 
several pools of liquid there. She 
decided not to explore further 
until she received assistance. 

The radio interrupted her ob- 
servations. “Dr. Verd, would you 
give us an atmosphere reading, 
please?” 

“Certainly, I’m sorry.” She 
plugged the small scanning device 
into her transmitter, pressed the 
switch. “I’m scanning now. What’s 
the good word?” 

Dr. Haicint’s voice came through 
the speaker: “Temperature read- 
ing — eighteen degrees.” 

She heard a voice in the back- 
ground pipe in: “eighteen, that’s 
almost room temperature — ” 

“Atmosphere, nontoxic,” Dr. 
Hiacint continued. “Oxygen read- 
ing is too low to maintain life but 
high enough so our nasalators will 
be sufficient. Dr. Verd, you may 
disconnect your climatization unit 
but continue using oxygen until 
we get there' with a supply of 
nasalators.” 

“Fine. Will we have enough 
oxygen supplies?” 

“At those levels we could last 
several months. Food could get to 



TERATOHIPPUS 



97 




be a problem. We’ll abandon the 
ship now and join you. We’ll take 
along all the oxygen and food sup- 
plies we have. How difficult is 
entry?” 

“It’s an easy slope, no worse 
than some of the hills out on the 
tundra. The creature is moving 
away from the ship, but very 
slowly.” 

“Fine, we’ll join you there 
shortly.” 

F or just a moment she had the 
peculiar sensation that her 
young were inside her again, but 
the great squirming and moving 
around were missing and none of 
her milk had been touched. The 
single sensation was there, but it 
was not substantiated by other 
sensations, so it must have been in 
error. 

This was not a usual occurrence 
for a teratohippus, but her survival 
will was strong. She decided to 
move more rapidly. The strange 
sensation made her think of the 
young ones waiting for her back 
in the nest. They would need the 
milk she had been manufacturing 
throughout her circular eating 
journey. ' 

She must reach them before 
they came out. Or they would die. 

Her head turned a little more to- 
ward the nest and her motile 



muscles speeded up their cycle of 
contractions. 

She was going home. 

M illie felt rather than saw 
or heard the movement 
above. She flashed her light upon 
the forward wall (opposite the 
cavity entrance) and saw high 
above a row of throbbing tendons 
— wirelike strands — lying close 
to the wall and interwoven upon 
themselves. There were far too 
many to count. They stretched 
about two meters from a point ;at 
the highest peak of the ceiling to a 
long, narrow opening just above 
the creature’s nostrils. The throb- 
bing seemed to be irregularly 
paced. When her light flashed 
across the weird assembly of 
strands, those on the right side 
seemed to be throbbing wildly. 

She started to step closer to 
explore the phenomenon, then 
thought better of it. Perhaps she 
should wait until the Dr. Hiacint 
arrived. The function of the ten- 
dons made three mysteries about 
this beast. She had some ideas, 
but they seemed farfetched. 
Dr. Hiacint would corroborate her 
theories or clear up the uncer- 
tainties. 

She went through the problems 
again in her mind. Why was this 
chamber so much larger than 
other similar ones she knew of? 



98 



IF 




What was the purpose of the pools 
of fluid on the edge of the chamber? 
And what were those piano wires 
against the anterior wall? 

She unstrapped the heating unit 
from her back, placed it on the 
floor and sat down upon it. She 
had a while to wait. 

Ill 

W 'HEN the five men arrived 
they were heavily loaded with 
equipment. They had enough oxy- 
gen for several months, thanks to 
the nasalators — the type that 
strapped around the neck. The 
flattened tube that curved across 
the cheekbone and fed oxygen 
into the left nostril would be un- 
comfortable but necessary. 

Emergency rations^ they had for 
quite a few days, but the only com- 
munications equipment consisted 
of small transceivers in the EV 
suits, plus one small transmitter 
Stef Chambelan had salvaged from 
the ship. He hoped to make use of 
the unused power cells in the EV 
suits to get it operating at least on 
a line-of-sight basis. 

Dr. Hiacint had his Prolyzer, of 
course, and Dr. Dalmat had 
scrounged up every scanning de- 
vice he could find and carry. 
Dalmat’s concern was less for 
survival than for the gathering of 
knowledge. As a documentarian. 



he lived in a worldf^-^a. Im- 
mortality lay for him' #ifhin a vast 
and well-arranged array of facts 
that would be used and appreciated 
by' future scientists. Compared 
with that, what had mere life to 
offer? 

The archivalists were quite meek 
by now. The shock of approaching 
death had knocked all the pom- 
posity out of them. Their work re- 
warded them well — but only during 
their lifetimes. They were fright- 
ened and carried their share of 
supplies from the ship. They also 
carried an unbelievable number 
of legal documents related to 
Betul. If they had any real dedica- 
tion it was to the furtherance of 
Earth’s supremacy in interspace 
law — documents were proof and 
proof was essential to law. 

Chambelan mounted a simple 
video-scanner on the surface 
armor of the teratohippus, then 
settled down to his transmitter. 

The three astrobiologists began a 
systematic exploration of their 
new home. 

<<TWTELL, Professor, what 
W do you think of it?” 
Millie was seated with the rest as 
they ate their first day’s rations. 
It had been a hard day and much 
was still unanswered. While the 
biologists had been examining the 
cavity little had been spoken. 



TERATOHIPPUS

Hiacint thought a moment be- 
fore he answered. “I’m sure my 
conclusions will be the same as 
yours, Dr. Verd. 1 would say that 
the size of the cavity and the pools 
of fluid are related to each other. 
But the ‘pihno wires’ as you call 
them are another thing entirely. 
Don’i you agree?’’ 

“Yes,’’ Millie answered. “I 
think I know what the first two 
mean, but the third has me 
stumped.” 

“All right, you tell me what the 
first two are and I’ll tell you what 
the third is.” 

“You know?” 

“I think I know. But first things 
first.” 

Millie put the words together in 
her mind before she uttered them, 
then spoke carefully. “I’d say that 
the large size of the cavity means 
that it is used for some other pur- 
pose besides breathing— though it 
certainly serves as a breathing 
chamber, too. The pools of fluid 
provide a clue to that purpose. 
They seem to me to have only one 
possible use — to feed the young of 
the creature.” 

Smirg cut in; “You mean that 
stuff is milk?” 

“Yes, milk.” Millie grinned. 
“Just as in terrestrial mammals, 
except there are no mammae. I 
would guess that the fluid is created 
and stored here during a feeding 



cycle and the young feed on it dur- 
ing a nursing cycle that comes 
next.” 

“This place we’re in is a kind of 
womb?” Smirg again. He was 
looking around in awe. 

“Yes, a womb or a nursing 
chamber. She probably carries the 
young here during the next cycle, 
as I said, while she feeds. That 
would explain the extraordinarily 
high temperature. This cavity 
would also serve as protection for 
the young — both from predators 
and from the cold. They probably 
stay in here until they develop 
considerable size and are equipped 
with armor sufficient for life 
outside.” 

Smirg was looking at the tiny 
aperture. “If they get very large 
how in the world to they get out 
through that opening?” 

Hiacint said, “There are two 
possible answers. First, the open- 
ing-just like the human vagina — 
might expand enough to let the 
young escape. The second, and I 
think the more plausible, answer is 
that the opening doesn’t expand, 
but that the parent teratohippus is 
gradually consumed in the process 
of nursing and the young merely 
break their way out of the parent’s 
carcass when the process is com- 
pleted. Wouldn’t you agree. Dr. 
Verd?” , 

“Yes,” Millie answered. “I 



100 



IF 




hadn’t thought about it, but I 
believe you must be right. She 
probably is destroyed in the pro- 
cess of ‘giving birth.’” 

Smirg looked a little upset at the 
thought. ‘‘But what about the male, 
does he krap on living while the 
female dies?” 

Both Millie and the professor 
were smiling. ‘‘I don’t think we’ll 
find that there is a male,” Hiacint 
said. 

‘‘But you call this creature ‘she.’ ” 

‘‘Merely a euphemism, a term 
we’ve carried over from our terres- 
trial experience. 1 believe these 
creatures are asexual. The young 
are exact copies of the parents. 
But the functions we are describ- 
ing here more closely resembles 
that of the Earth female than of 
the male, so I think we’re justified 
in referring to the animal as a 
female.” 

Millie was thinking. ‘‘Professor, 
how many young do you estimate 
there are?” 

‘‘Judging by the number of 
pools. I’d say no more than four. 
There could be only one, of course, 
but I doubt it. The species would 
not last long on a one-to-one natal 
basis with the parent dying at 
childbirth.” 

‘‘But what about the third phe- 
nomenon, the ‘piano wires’? You 
said you had the solution to that.” 

“I believe I do.” Dr. Hiacint 



said. ‘‘This creatnr<|^i|^^^i^tal. 
If it originally were a 
ture, as I think it was, it prpbab^ 
had an endoskeletal structure to 
begin with. I’m guessing that with 
the genetic change — due not only 
to exigency but to massive gamma 
radiation from the dying star (this 
planet’s sun) that caused the change 
in the planet — the central motor 
elements of the creature were 
trapped in a middle position. Be- 
cause they controlled movement 
they could not exist completely 
externally, but with the eons-long 
shift to an external skeleton they 
could not remain within the animal. 
1 believe those wires up there are 
the mechanical motor control ele- 
ments of teratohippus. They link' 
the brain with the muscular 
structure.” 

‘‘This means,” Dalmat said, 
‘‘that the teratohippus can be con- 
trolled by any person who could 
discover the meaning and function 
of each of those strands.” 

‘‘Like a puppet, you mean?” 
asked Smirg. 

‘‘Not like a puppet — but as ani- 
mate beings are controlled — ” 

‘‘That program you wel'e work- 
ing on, Dalmat, did you complete 
it?” Hiacint and Dalmat had 
worked together for many years 
and they almost read each other’s 
minds. 

‘‘Yes. Using the information Dr. 



TERATOHIPPUS 



101 




Vcrd gave us on the movement of 
the tendons when the teratohippus 
changed directions — and feeding in 
all the available data on the anat- 
omy of the animal — 1 have been 
able to identify at least those 
strands that control direction. We 
should now be able to divert the 
animal from its present course and 
direct it toward the temperate 
zone.” Silence fell — the silence of 
immense relief — as Dalmat con- 
tinued: ‘‘From my calculations— 
bas^ on Dr. Hiacint’s data, of 
course — I estimate it will take 
about two and a h^lf Earth months 
to reach a sufficiently southern 
position for a Mayday message to 
get through to Betulbase with line- 
of-sight broadcast.” 

Chambelan broke in. ‘‘But what 
about food? I don’t think our 
present supply will last even with 
the strictest rationing.” 

‘‘We should be able to use the 
teratohippus not only for trans- 
portation but also for sustenance,” 
Hiacint said. ‘‘We’ll be able to 
supplement our present rations with 
the ‘milk’ of the creature. My 
tests show it to be nontoxic. It 
probably won’t taste very good, 
but I think it will keep us alive.” 
‘‘But will the food be digestible? 
After all, we’re dealing with an 
alien biological system.” 

“True, the substance contains 
proteoids not normally used by 



humans, but Dr. Verd and I have 
had a great deal of experience with 
this type of thing. I think we should 
be able shortly to produce enough 
artificial enzymes to allow us all 
to get the food we need. Here again 
the taste of the enzymes may not 
be the best, but survival itself- is 
at stake.” 

No one spoke for a while. The 
very concept was strange. To ride 
a living mountain to safety. To 
use the feeble strength of one 
human hand to turn and direct a 
creature as long as a football field. 

Finally Dalmat stood up. He 
took a sketch he had drawn and 
some wire and walked to the front 
of the creature. The others fol- 
lowed self-consciously, Hiacint 
holding a light for Dalmat. Using 
Chambelan’s shoulders, Dalmat 
clambered to a point where he 
could reach the left side of the 
field of strands. 

“These motor control elements 
seem to be, reversed. The left group 
controls the right side of the animal 
and vice versa.” He picked out a 
group of about ten or twelve and 
tied the wire around them. Draw- 
ing it tight, he threw the end to 
Hiacint, who anchored it firmly 
to the “floor” with a small spike. 

“This should make the animal 
b^in a slow turn to the right, back 
toward the south. In a few days 
we’ll alter the wire to straighten 



102 



IF 




out her course. Then we’ll be 
headed to safety. With our data 
plotter we’ll be able to keep a 
running record of general position 
and make changes as they are 
needed.” He brushed off his hands 
and looked at his work. “Not a bad 
job for a documentarian.” 

S HE felt her muscles tense in- 
voluntarily and then she 
realized she was moving toward 
the right. This could not be. She 
was moving away from her young. 
She could not do that. She must 
turn back. She flexed her muscles 
as best as she could, but she con- 
tinued to move to the right. 

Her young. What would happen 
to her young? But then the sensa- 
tion that her young were already 
within her womb was stronger 
now. Could it be? 

But no — she still should not be 
moving toward the right. She 
had turned right on her first two 
cycles, as was proper. For this and 
for the nursing cycles, she must 
move to the left. Something was 
wrong, but there was nothing she 
could do about it. 

She continued grazing — as she 
must. She continued trying to turn 
to the left, as she must. She con- 
tinued her steady pace, as she 
must. But the parental instinct 
cried within her with all the anguish 
of a species’ need. 



I T WAS many days later. The 
humans sat in the middle of the 
chamber, weary and impatient. 
Chambelan was twisting the dials 
on his transmitter, making another 
futile effort to reach someone with 
a Mayday. Smirg poured a vial 
of black liquid over a bowl of gray- 
ish paste and ate it with a spoon. 
It was peculiarly sweet — some- 
thing, he thought, like a rotten 
mango. 

It was night and the creature — 
as was its wont — had stopped its 
feeding until daybreak. The 
temperature outside was infinitely 
colder than anything on Earth but 
the inside temperature had dropped 
imperceptibly. 

Millie sat with her back turned 
to the rest, looking at the gasping 
nostrils lit up by the shadowy light 
of the group’s single functioning 
lattern. Finally she could stand it 
no more. 

“Don’t you feel the weeping?” 
she asked. 

“Weeping?” It was Parapet. 
“What weeping?” 

“The subtle shudder that she 
makes these days, a shudder that 
wasn’t there when we first found 
her. I think she’s weeping for her 
children that will probably die.” 
Parapet turned to Dr. Hiacint. 
“I think she’s cracking under the 
strain. Don’t you have any medi- 
cine to give her?” 



TERATOHIPPUS 



103 




The professor’s glance at Para- 
pet showed pure contempt. “She’s 
not cracking up. She’s right, you 
know. My instruments show a 
definite change in the teratohippus. 
‘Weeping’ may not be the right 
word, but it’s pretty close. We 
have warped this creature’s exis- 
tence, slain her children and now, 
perhaps, we are leading her to a 
certain death.” 

“But is it right. Professor?” 
Millie was on her feet. “Is it right 
for us to do this terrible thing? 
Wt are destroying not only a 
generation of these beings, we are 
leading this one— the creature that 
has been our salvation — into an 
environment that must kill her, to 
predators that will rip her to 
shreds, to a place where there will 
be no more food for her to eat. How 
can we justify our own existence 
with that crime over our heads?” 

“Survival.” Parapet’s face 
writhed with emotion. “Survival — 
in this situation, we are the con- 
querors. For all time, on every 
planet and between planets, the 
conquerors — the strongest, the 
most intelligent, the craftiest — 
were the survivors and the weak 
paid with their own destruction. 
Whether it be tribe or species or 
man-to-man, it is right and just for 
the strong to destroy.” 

“My God, man, your vicarious 
experience of interplanetary power 



has made you absolutely insane.” 
The speaker was Smirg. His attack 
on a fellow archivalist brought 
astonishment to every face. “The 
strong have not always destroyed 
the weak — not when strength was 
coupled with • intelligence, for 
strength can by augmented by the 
aid of the weak. The butchers of all 
time — the Huns of our Earth and 
the Achobests of space, for example 
— have conquered only to a point 
and then in turn been destroyed 
by the civilizations that utilized 
all elements, strong and weak, to 
form strength by unity. What Miss 
Verd is trying to ask is: is there 
another way? Can we save both 
ourselves and this creature?” 

Millie turned to face the profes- 
sor. “Isn’t there a way?” 

He shook his head. “Both Dal- 
mat and I have tried to find a solu- 
tion. We’ve worked out model after 
model. But every way we look at it, 
either we must die or the terato- 
hippus and its brood must die. 
There is no way to save all.” 

She turned her face again to the 
semidarkness. She spoke softly and 
as if by rote, as if she had rehearsed 
each word: “Then we must go on 
for another month, feeling the in- 
tense sorrow of a parent for its 
children? We must sit here and do 
nothing while this great creature 
slowly dies? We must try to wipe 
out from our minds and our con- 



104 



IF 




sciences the thought of the tera- 
tohippids out there somewhere 
dying?” 

“I guess we must.” 

Smirg walked over and took her 
hand. 

She did not object. And the shud- 
dering seemed to each of them to 
become more intense. 



S OMEWHERE in the vast 
reaches of the tundra, within a 
neat cavern dug into the side of a 
frozen rill, lay three neat round 
shells. Giant cocoon^ in which 
young life was stiring. 

The time had come. Genetics 
willed that they must come out, to 
creep into the warm womb of their 
parent. The shells shook with the 
struggle to escape. 

A crack in each in turn let in the 
frozen atmosphere and movement 
stopped. The mouth of the cavern, 
normally covered by thje warm 
body of the parent teratohippus^ 
was open to the chill world. 

There were no further struggles 
and no cries. The strong had won. 
The weak were dead. 

Somewhere far away a weeping 
mountain knew the time had 
come and passed. And continued 
its involuntary way toward the land 
where vespertosauri and sciurop- 
teroids would soon feast on its 
remains. #

SHAUSTA 



DAVID LEWIS 

The alien gave him a game to 
play — and one chance to win! 



T he Terrans have poker and 
horses and wheels. The Kalidar 
have shausta. That would be fine, 
except that on Kalidar home terri- 
tory you only play shausta, period. 
Poker? With the Kalidar? You 
might as well spit on their flag. So 
there’s half of the basics of inter- 
planetary gambling. The other half 
comes later. 

Now, I take my living from 
Sanka Maru, a Japanese ship on 
the Kalidar run, but times have 
changed and a merchant doesn’t 
sign on cutthroats any more. I’m a 
junior navigator and have been for 
five years. Promotion is slow on an 
Asian ship, especially for Cau- 
casians. It’s one of those things you 
learn to put up with and cheerfully, 
too, all things considered. 

The pay level’s good — I might get 
promoted — and twice a year I see 
the Kalidar. Forget about shausta, 
and the Kals are great people to 
know. 

Their physical appearance helps, 
of course. Any one of them could 
visit Earth and pass himself off as a 
Terran if he really wished to. There 
are enough odd Terrans around to 
make almost any Kal look nearly 
normal. As a people they average a 
half-head shorter than the average 
human, have higher, flatter cheek- 
bones and beakish noses. As I re- 
call, there was some chortling 
about their low foreheads when pic- 



tures first reached our enlightened 
world, but something the pictures 
didn’t show was how far back the 
Kalidar skull goes. I don’t enjoy 
deflating egos, but their actual 
cranial cavity is somewhere around 
a quarter again larger than ours. 
That’s something worth our 
thinking about. 

What really wins us to the Kals, 
though, is pity. Imagine how you 
would take to being packed into 
some glorified refrigerator on 
board an unproven settlement ship 
and having yourself fired at some 
obscure dot on the edge of the inter- 
galactic abyss. Furthermore, pic- 
ture yourself arriving at your new 
Eden after a hundred years or so, 
only to find it aswarm with ratty 
humanoids busy calling themselves 
the only intelligent race in the 
universe. Yes, pity. The Kalidar 
situation is pathetic, and humanity 
goes wild over things like that. 
That’s why we’re so wonderful and 
that’s why we let them have Mars. 

So there are two big pluses for 
the Kalidar — they look like us and 
are pitiful. Other than that, one can 
put away a sizable fortune selling 
Kalidar merchandise back home, 
which helps us like each other 
economywise, too. That leaves 
only one more good reason for in- 
terracial amity between us and the 
Kals — or it seems good to me. The 
Kalidar aren’t perfect. 



SHAUSTA 



107 




1 know that doesn't sound like 
much, but after years of comic- 
book indoctrination, humanity had 
been expecting First contact with 
some wildly Superior beings who 
would make us feel that the plug 
had been pulled on our l^appy little 
world. 

It didn't work o\it that way. 

T here are enough things 
morally, socially and techno- 
logically wrong with the Kalidar to 
leave us feeling smugly superior as 
long as we ignore things morally, 
socially and technologically wrong 
with humanity. For instance, the 
Kals have narcotics, violence and 
thieves. Beyond that, they have 
been known to cheat in business 
deals and, most importantly for me, 
they have a penchant for games of 
chance. Now what could be much 
more human than that? 

So you see. I'm back to shausta 
already. 

Shausta is the Kalidar game of 
chance. It is largely mathematical. 
It is easy to learn, harder to play, 
easiest to lose at. It is also well 
worth one's trying and it deserves 
some explanation, seeing that I'm 
writing about it. 

For the best that I can offer we 
have to go back some five years. 
That was when 1 was on my first 
run, had laid foot on Martian soil 
for the first time ever and was as 



green a novice as Sanka Maru had 
ever seen. I was also as green a no- 
vice as Nathaniel Sanderson, Cau- 
casian and mere cargo lugger for 
fifteen years, had ever seen or 
wished to. 

Sanderson was a veteran of the 
Kalidar run. He had signed on the 
first ship out and as a result of his 
lengthy experience he knew as 
much about the Kalidar as any man 
alive when he retired. And before 
that golden day arrived he passed 
on to me much of what he had 
learned. He started the night we 
grounded — with shausta. 

“You might as well start learning 
the ropes now,” he said. “It'll 
take a long time.” 

“Sure,” I answered. “Whatever 
you say.” 

We had become friends on the 
journey out on a basis of one-sided 
respect. 

“We'll start with shausta,” he 
said. “It'll do you the most good in 
the least time and it isn't hard. If 
you're the average crewman and 
want some port life once you've 
grounded you play shausta until 
you've made some friends among 
the Kals. Furthermore, if youH*e an 
offworlder and want to make some 
friends shausta's the only way to 
fly. Got that?” 

“Yes,” 1 said, wondering what 
this thing was. 

“Shausta is Kalidar poker,” 



108 



IF 




continued Sanderson, answering 
my question by chance. “It’s dif- 
ferent, of course,-^but it’s a game of 
chance — like rolling dice. 

“The only thing is that shausta’s 
mathematical. Here’s the setup. 

“To start with you’ve got the 
First Caller. When a round opens 
this character spouts a number — 
let’s say ten. Then his assistant, the 
Action Determiner, pulls an action 
card from a pile on the floor in 
front of him. In shausta you sit on 
the floor, see? Now, the action card 
has a mathematical process on it — 
addition, subtraction, etcetera, on 
up to cubing. And here’s the 
gamble part of it. You, the player, 
don’t get to see the action card. 
That’s a privilege reserved for the 
Determiner. 

“Okay. Once you’ve got your 
first number and a card has been 
pulled, the Second Caller gives you 
another number. It can be anything 
as long as it’s rational. The First 
Caller can give you an irrational if 
he feels like it. You following me?’’ 

“Good. Now here’s the game. 
You make a stab at what action 
was pulled for you and work it out 
in your head. The First Caller gave 
you ten. The Second Caller gives 
you thirteen. What do you say?’’ 

I thought for a moment. 

“Twenty-three,” I said. 

“You lose.” Sanderson grinned. 
“Your action card was multiplica- 



tion. What’s more, cvcaif you get 
the right action but don’t come up 
with the exact answer of, say, the 
square root of thirteen divided by 
nine-eighteenths, you lose. That 
means your figuring had better be 
on the beam — you’ve only got two 
minutes. Overstep the time limit 
and you lose. In the beginning the 
numbers are simple — you don’t hit 
irrationals and stuff until the stakes 
start getting high. Stakes always 
start ojut low and it’s in incredibly 
bad taste to wager more than a 
hundred. If by some chance your 
action card is squaring or cubing 
the Action Determiner holds up a 
clenched fist. That’s to tell the 
Second Caller not to give you 
another number and you square or 
cube the one you already have. 
That’s the game — except for one 
more official, usually a computer 
that works out the problem you’ve 
been given. His — its — word is law. 
If your answers don’t match you 
lose. Simple as that. All you need to 
do is keep your head and think 
clearly. It’s errors in figuring that 
usually show who comes out on top. 
The drawing business is all chance 
and players average about the same 
number of right or wrong guesses, 
usually wrong. 

“You ready to play?” 

“No,” I said, too quickly. 

“Didn’t think so,” he agreed. 
“But come along and watch. 



SHAUSTA 



109 




Maybe you’ll think differently by 
the time we leave.” 

“Maybe,” I echoed. 

So we went. 

I QUICKLY discovered two 
things about shausta and the 
Kalidar that Sanderson had 
neglected to tell me. For one, 
shausta could not have been a 
worse game for the Kalidar to play. 

Can you imagine any Earthside 
gambler with enough faith in his 
own intelligence to add figuring out 
equations in two minutes flat to the 
already risky element of chance in a 
game? I can’t — and that’s why I 
was worried about shausta. I felt 
that any race crazy enough to in- 
vent such a gamble must be a race 
of mathematical wizards. And 1 
couldn’t have been more wrong. 
The Kalidar 1 met that night were 
more like mathematical slugs, so 
much so that by the time we left I 
was sure an unhampered Terran 
could run rings around most any 
one of them. But I suppose you 
caught that modifier — “unham- 
pered.” 

The Kalidar played dirty. 

The Kalidar played background 
music. 

Such background music you have 
never heard. Maybe you think that 
some oriental tunes sound alien to 
the Caucasian ear and vice versa. I 
do and I have evidence from the 



other side. It’s taken me five years 
to get used to what Sanka Manias 
captain pipes over the intercoms at 
night — for me it’s one of those 
things that you learn to live with, 
like slow promotions. But the stuff 
that the Kalidar play is alien to 
where you can feel it like a brick. 

Considering the importance of 
the tachika style to interplanetary 
gambling. I’ll go into some detail. 
First of all, the music is always 
played in shausta houses ^nd it’s al- 
ways played live by a husband-and- 
wife team. These two characters are 
extraordinary in themselves, fanati- 
cally devoted to their .music and 
generally semistarved. They double 
on the instruments — two large 
recorders, one small one and a 
snaredrum-proportioned percus- 
sion piece — but at least one of the 
the big recorders is always in use, 
giving what is best described as the 
melody line. 

The music starts. Every piece 
opens the same way, with the man 
taking a shuddering breath and 
blowing the lowest possible note for 
the longest possible time. Then, 
eyes bulging, he nips a quick breath 
and shoots chromatically up and 
down his range in maybe ten 
seconds, which isn’t to say that his 
range is short but that he’s playing 
somewhat faster than sixty-fourth 
notes. Then you know the concert 
has begun. The man gives another

long low note, this one accompa- 
nied by wife on percussion— and 
next the world between your ears 
erupts in a burst of what I under- 
stand is sheer improvisation along 
standard themes that will last 
anywhere from a quarter to a half- 
hour, whereupon both musicians 
collapse, clawing for air and water, 
only to start up again immediately 
after. 

If you were a lover of music I 
suppose you could learn to love 
this. I don't mind it myself as long 
as I’m not doing anything, since 
strange as it seems, tachika is a su- 
perb tranquilizer. The only problem 
is, they always play it during 
rounds of shausta and if you’re 
doing the gaming you^ll soon find 
that you can’t think clearly, that 
numbers get lost somewhere below 
your cranium and over your eyes 
and that you lose whatever bet you 
made. 

That’s what I mean by the 
Kalidar’s playing dirty. Tachika 
brings you down to the same math- 
ematical plane they inhabit and 
maybe below it. When Sanderson 
and I left the action that night I was 
positive I could play the game, but I 
was equally sure that tachika 
would give me hell when I tried. 

Of course, there’s more to this 
tachika than I’ve mentioned — one 
more important thing must be 
covered. Kalidar music is partly 



built around silence. For a climax 
they don’t always use a crescendo — 
sometimes they use nothing, 

There you are, listening, as the 
scales wail up and sob down and 
suddenly — nothing. Dead silence. 
Except that if the prelude has been 
handled well your mind is still 
hearing the rhythm and abandons 
everything. It closes in on that 
mental pounding, since you are in a 
shocking pool of silence and there’s 
nothing else to grab hold of. The 
pounding in your head gets louder 
and louder until it threatens to split 
your skull like an overblown 
balloon. You feel the tension 
straining every bone and muscle 
and when the recorders suddenly 
howl out again in the middle of a 
phrase at ten times the volume they 
started out with you don’t even 
notice thent — they are quieter than 
what your mind has been giving you 
and you know the climax came in 
that silence you could taste like a 
scum in your mouth. 

A tachika piece usually onds 
pretty quickly after that bubble 
breaks. 

Like I said, it’s alien. 

B ut as I was also saying, I was 
* worried about how tachika 
would effect my playing and I was 
doubly worried since I had just seen 
it affect Sanderson’s. I knew that a 
genius he was not, but I also knew 



SHAUSTA 



111 




that he should have done better 
than he did^ and I couldn’t under- 
stand why he hadn’t asked for 
silence while he played, so I asked 
him. 

“Grissom,” he said heavily, 
“there’s something you had better 
learn and quickly. It’s a sort of 
Golden Rule and I hoped you’d 
learn it while serving on a Japanese 
ship. But I guess hot. So here it is. 
Don’t question an alien custom. 
Tolerate it. You don’t need to like 
it, but you have no business at- 
tacking it. You had just better learn 
to live with it. You understand 
that?” 

“Yes,” I said stubbornly. “But 
suppose it’s not a custom. What if 
the Kals mixed tachika and shausta 
after they found tachika puts us 
into a coma? They must know it 
does that.” 

Sanderson nodded. “Maybe, but 
ours not to question why — ours but 
to do or die. They say it’s custom so 
we take their word forjt. Period.” 

And that was that. We didn’t talk 
anymore that night since custom 
had skinned one Nathaniel San- 
derson and had really skinned him 
bad. 

And so here I am, five years later 
and getting pretty good at shausta 
myself and with a bit of evidence to 
back up my old friend’s beliefs. 
That bit of evidence constitutes the 
second half of necessary interpla- 



netary gambling knowledge. I 
learned it the hard way, but I think 
I’ll spare you the pains. This is what 
happened three years ago on San- 
derson’s last run and my fourth. 

Sanderson knew it was his last 
run and had decided to spend his 
last evening before we spaced with 
old friends. This left me on my own. 
So I went to a shausta house and 
put myself into the running. 

“Greetings,” welcomed Tarran, 
the proprietor. “It is good to see 
Grissom. Sanka Maru spaces 
tomorrow and we will not see 
Grissom for many months. Enjoy 
this evening for us.” 

“I’Jl do my best,” I answered as I 
paid the entrance fee. “Pm sorry I 
haven’t been in more often.” 

“This way, Grissom,” he said 
without other comment — pleasant- 
ries had been dispensed with at the 
door. “Will please you to follow?” 
In a shausta house the proprietor 
is god. I followed. 

He led me to the gaming room 
and held open heavy, cast doors. He 
followed me in and the tongue of 
light our entrance had made disap- 
peared. My sight went black and I 
struggled to adjust. I had no trouble 
picking out the red smudge pots 
hanging over every gaming post, 
but the fades below them remained 
tinted smears in the dark. Only the 
tachika players could be seen 
clearly, the twin white candles they 



112 



IF 




played by providing the needed 
light. 

“There is one here who would 
play you, Grissom,” whispered 
Tarran. “Have you objections?” 

“No,” I whispered back, still 
trying to pick out details. It 
couldn’t hurt. I knew no one here 
and if someone knew me, fine. Be- 
sides, Kalidar custom says that you 
accept a seating request. 

With a surety that my own con- 
founded eyes found amazing, Tar- 
ran picked his way through the 
floor-seated throng and brought me 
to one of the red smudge pots. Only 
one shadowed figure sat at this one, 
not counting the gaming officials, 
but there was an unoccupied 
cushioi^. I sat down. 

“Welcome, Grissom,” whispered 
my opposite. “I am happy to see 
you t^fore you space.” 

T hat voice was the first really 
pleasant surprise of the whole 
three-month run. It belonged to the 
one Kalidar on Mars I could al- 
most consider a friend. He had a 
small mine in the outback and since 
1 hadn’t met him portside I had 
assumed he was out working it. It 
seemed that I was wrong. 

“Lyrr,” I said, too loudly for the 
heavy atmosphere. “This is a good 
meeting! When did you get in?” 

A toothy grin flashed in the dark. 
“Today, Grissom. I hear the 



Maru has grounded and hurry — but 
the desert is wide and my crawler 
breaks down. I have to walk!” 

I returned the grin. Pleasant sur- 
prise number two: he had come all 
the way in from his claim to see me. 
Sanderson’s circle of acquaintances 
had stirred my envy, but maybe, if 
my luck held, I might have one of 
my own. I started to speak, but as 
fate or whatever would have it, I 
didn’t finish. A rich bass wail cut 

i. 

through the murk and a tachika 
piece began. 

“Players,” hissed the First 
Caller. “The placing of bets. You 
will decide who begins.” 

I looked at Lyrr. I could make 
out his face after a fashion, but his 
eyes still hid in pockets of shadow. I 
motioned for him to take the first 
round. He nodded and pulled out 
his credit sack. I matched him with 
my wallet. 

“Three darro, Grissom?” he 
whispered. 

Three darro. About a dollar. 

I nodded. He smiled. 

“The first number?” he asked 
and, as if in answer, the tachika 
recorder scuttled over its full range 
and the piece began in earnest. 
Tension made its first appearance. 

“Four,” said the First Caller. 

The Action Determiner pulled a 
card. 

“Six,” said the Second Caller. 

Lyrr thought for a moment, then 



SHAUSTA 



113 




grinned at me. “Twenty-four,” he 
said. 

The computer, accepting card 
and punched-in numbers, clicked 
once. The screen went green and 
formed a ten. Lyrr gave me three 
darro credits and it was my turn. 
When the computer dispensed its 
answer I returned the notes. 

That set the pace for the evening. 
One tachika piece ended; another 
began. The second ran down and a 
third filled the void. The bets be- 
came higher, the problems harder. I 
made my first calculating mistake, 
Lyrr his second. At no point did we 
stay more than ten darro richer or 
poorer than when we began. The 
tachika made me stumble on simple 
irrationals and before I knew it the 
irrationals were complex, with bets 
pushing two hundred and forty, two 
hundr^ and fifty, two hundred and 
sixty darro. I began to sweat. I 
began to sweat badly. Heck, I 
began to drip! 

“The quantity three times the 
square root of one hundred and se- 
venty-one over twenty-three,” said 
the First Caller and I got out a two- 
hundred seventy note. 

“The square root of eighteen over 
the square root of twenty-three,” 
said the First Caller and I got it 
back. 

A RIVER ran down my back. We 
^ had been playing some two 



and a half hours. If I could get the 
next one right 1 would be up some 
ninety dollars. If I lost — well, Lyrr 
would be happy. With a shock I re- 
membered that I had never pushed 
over eighty before. 

“The quantity five times the 
square root of twenty-seven over 
the quantity the square root of 
three,” proposed the First Caller. 

“Thirteen,” said the second. 

I breathed in. It didn't sound too 
hard, not hard at all provided I 
guessed the right action. I breathed 
oiit. It was multiplication. Believe 
me, I knew! I started figuring. 

The square root of twenty-seven 
breaks down into three times the 
square root of threcr— three times 
five is fifteen — clear the bottom 
root by squaring and multiply the 
numerator by the square root of 
three. Fifteen times three over 
three — forty-five over three — 

fifteen! I had it! I was invincible! 

And then, suddenly, the tachika 
music stopped. 

But it was really only the sound 
that had stopped. 

It was a silent crescendo — one of 
the silent crescendos. I thought I 
hadn't been listening closely 
enough — I had willed myself not 
to — but it was a vain hope. The 
tachika rhythm began sounding in 
my head, and with infuriating speed 
my mind closed in on it. Up and 
down, over and around, up and 



114 



IF 




thirteen times fifteen is up and 
down and the first beat of silence 
washed into me, turning my spine 
into ice and the up and down and 
beat number two sent my skeleton 
freezing clear out to the nerves and 
the down and around and the third 
squashed my mind into jelly and so 
help me God, I couldn’t think! 
Forty seconds left and I couldn’t 
think! 

The fourth beat crested, worse 
than before. I felt myself explode. 

“Stop that damned music,’’ 1 
shouted. 

It stopped. Dead. 

1 h^dd just about twenty seconds 
to spare. 

Forty-five plus one hundred and 
fifty, I figured. 

“One-hundred and ninety-five,’’ I 
said, and the computer confirmed 
it. Lyrr passed me two-hundred and 
seventy darro credits. I smiled., I 
was alone in that. 

The First Caller watched from 
behind his red-mask face. He mo- 
tioned toward the tachika players. 

“No,’’^ I said and their instru- 
ments stopped halfway. , 

“Grissom,’’ whispered Lyrr. 

“No,’’ I repeated. “No music.’’ 

I was ninety dollars in the black. 
I was going to stay there. To you- 
know-where with Sanderson’s rule. 
No Kal connivers were, going to 
skin me that night. Even ^ Lyrr, 
friendly, grinning, deceitful Lyrr, 

SHAUSTA 



finally had turned against me. 
Ever hear of gold fever? 

T ^HE First Caller regarded me 
solemnly. He rose and spoke to 
the players. The hiss of the Kalidar 
tongue drifted back across the 
room. The two gaunt musicians laid 
their recorders aside. Thty extin- 
guished their candles and came to 
stand in the darkness around us. I 
became aware of a shifting center 
of attention. Our gaming post was 
collecting an audience. 

Fine, I thought. They deserve to 
watch. 

“Two hundred and eighty-five 
dapro, Lyrr?’’ I suggested. 

.^he mask of his face let no emo- 
tion slip. “Yes,“ he whispered. 
“Two hundred and eighty-five” 

The tension began to build. 
Ninety-five dollars. Couldn’t get 
much higher. 

“Seventy-three and fifty-six hun- 
dredths,’’ said the First Caller. 

The Action Determiner pulled his 
card. He raised a clenched fist and 
Lyrr had his first power probleni. 

My mind raced, no longer 
restrained by tachika. Lyrr was 
good, but he wasn’t a genius. He 
would probably square his number 
and hope. That was what I would 
have done. I don’t know if the 
Kalidar pray. 

“Three hundred and ninety-eight 
thousand thirty-^ight and five 

115 




hundred seventy-four thousand 
sixteen millionths/' said Lyrr. 

I gaped. I was only part way 
through figuring it out for myself^, 
but I could already see he had 
cubed it. My jaw swayed a little 
farther then. Only twenty seconds 
had flown. 

The computer agreed with him — 
398038.574016. 

I paid up uneasily. It was graph- 
ically clear that Lyrr was a genius 
with squares and cubes. This was 
his first such problem for the 
evening and now I was five in the 
red. In the next round I would 
probably slap myself further. 

“Grissom,” whispered Lyrr. 
“Two hundred and eighty-five 
darro?” 

He wasn’t increasing the bet. 
That suited me fine and I nodded. 

“Negative sixty-three and se- 
venty-two hundredths,” said the 
First Caller. I went a hundred in the 
red. 

But averages cut both ways. Lyrr 
would pull me out. I raised the bet 
by three darro and he agreed 
reluctantly. He had no choice. 
When the shock waves died down I 
owed him one hundred and ninety- 
six dollars. I had to write an I.O.U. 

“Two hundred and eighty-eight 
darro?” he suggested slowly. I think 
he would have reduced it if custom 
hadn’t stood in the way. I accepted. 

Then divine providence stepped 



in. I got out the right answer with 
seconds to spare. The debt became 
smaller and. the averages were 
overwhelmingly bad for Lyrr. 

“Three hundred darro,” 1 hissed 
and we hit the highest ceiling. There 
was no grin from the other side. 

“Ninety-two and twenty-nine 
thousandths,” whispered the First 
Caller. 

“Twenty-seven and one hundred 
and three thousandths,” breathed 
the Second. 

A general inhalation rose from 
the shadows around us. The whole 
house was watching. Lyrr sat in 
silence, his eyes still hidden in black 
pockets, but the red mask was 
creased and damp. My foot was 
falling asleep with nettle-like tin- 
gles. 

“Two thousand four hundred and 
ninety-four and two hundred sixty- 
one thousand nine hundred and 
eighty-seven millionths,” said Lyrr, 
not looking up. 

The computer verified his 
figure — 2494.261987 — and the 
game ended in bedlam. 

S OMEHOW I scrawled another 
* I.O.U. and made my way out of 
the milling, dark-shrouded crowd. 
Somehow I remembered how the 
low-pressure air-lock worked and 
remembered to turn on my respi- 
rator before breathing the near- 



116 



IF 




vacuum outside. Then I was 
walking away from the shausta 
house, moving numbly toward the 
port, where floodlights lent a car- 
nival air to the loading of Sanka 
Afaru. 

“Grissom,” said a voice. Lyrr, of 
course. 

I stumbled on without looking 
up. I could barely hear his feet hit- 
ting the sand beside me. 

“Grissom.” He sighed, accepting 
a bad loser. “I wish to return your 
money.” 

“No,” I growled. 

“Yes,” he said. “Money gained 
by cheating is not worth one’s 
keeping. I return it.” 

The bills pressed into my fist. ! 
took them automatically. 

“Grissom,” continued Lyrr, “is 
not surprising you think we are 
cheaters. Tachika dulls you and be- 
cause you see us figure badly you 
think we are trying to gain an ad- 
vantage. But you are wrong. 
Tachika came to the shausta house 
long before the Kalidar came to 
Mars. It is only to make things 
fair.” 

I was listening uncomfortably. 

“Sanderson, he got angry one 
time, too. I was not there, but the 
story stays. He stopped the tachika 
and was beaten as you were. Then 
we Kalidar thought it fun, but we 
have since learned differently. It is 
cheating to use something another 



has not, even if you are born with it. 

“Grissom, we Kalidar are good 
with numbers, as you can see, but 
there is something more. Among 
ourselves we are also telepaths. We 
can try to shut out errant thoughts, 
but even so, when the Action Deter- 
miner looks at a card, in my head I 
know what action he sees. That is 
why we have tachika. It dulfs you, 
but it dulls us even more and it 
screens out telepathy to make 
shausta a game instead of an exer- 
cise. It is not to dull humans, but to 
dull the Kalidar.” 

I stopped and looked at him. 

“You know, Lyrr?” I said. “I’ve 
been a fool. What Sanderson said 
wasn’t drivel.” 

He couldn’t understand me, but 
he grinned regardless. I could see 
his eyes now in the glare from the 
port and they certainly weren’t 
grim. 

“Grissom,” he said, “when does 
Sanka Afaru space? Early or late in 
the morning?” 

“Neither,” I told him. “Middle 
of the afternoon.” 

“Then come,” he said abruptly. 
“Rest at my home this evening. 
There is time in the morning for 
you to get back and there is much I 
need to know of Earth — what cus- 
toms not to break in chance- 
playing!” 

So I went home with him and 
taught him poker. ®

I 

i<|-TP, FISK,” Yola said. 

“Earn your daily bonus 
and commission or etee.” 

Fisk Centers rolled over groggily. 
“Else what?” ~ 

“This.” An avalanche of icy 
foam descended on his head. 

He struggled up, gasping for 
breath, suddenly wide awake. 
“What was that for?” 

“Well, I did warn you,” she said 
contritely. “You look like a walrus 
surfacing.” 

“Nonsense. I don’t have tusks.” 
“A toothless walrus, then. Fat, 
wet, stupid — ” 

“You’re about to look like a 
spanked brat.” 

“No time,” she said. “Bolt your 
food, Fisky. Today you go to work 
for your living.” 

“What makes you so sure I’ll 
have any better luck today than I’ve 
had all week?” 

“Because you handled the week. I 
set up today. While you snored.” 

“I should have stayed single,” 
Fisk muttered as he stumbled to the 
suiter and let it dry and dress him. 
“Or at least gotten married. The 
last thing any sane man would 
do is become an adoptive father to 
a pre-teen hellion.” 

“Right,” she agreed. “Especially 
when he has to live off her money.” 
“That’s my money! Twenty per 



cent Coitmrlision just for — ” 

“For sdliiig an innocent child on 
the Uack mar-^” 

“S9«it up.” He stepped out of the 
suiter, resplendent in blue jeans, 
checkered shirt and goggles. “What 
did you do to the setting?” he 
roared. 

“You look just right for your 
job,” she said. “Hurry up.” 

He tore off the goggles. “My 
job-^oihg what?” 

“Selling cars, of course.” 

“Cars? I’m no mechanic — ” 
“That’s all you know. Dad. 
Salesmen don’t have to know 
anything about the workings. Just 
believe in your product and sell, 
sell, seU!” 

Fisk punched a soy omelet. “Be- 
lieve in my product? I haven’t even 
driven a car for five years.” He 
took a bite, but paused before 
masticating it. “What car am I sup- 
posed to sell?” 

“Fusion. They’ve got a real nice 
commission deal — ” 

The mouthful of omelet sprayed 
over the table. “The atomic racer? 
The radioactive juggernaut that 
makes the obituary headlines every 
other week? The — ” 

“The same. They’re making a 
play for the middle-class market 
and they need middle-class 
salesmen. Hot chance for you.” 
“Hot? Listen, Yola — do you 
realize that my annuities don’t

mature for another twenty-five 
years and are voided in the event of 
deliberate suicide? If I die tomor- 
row in a Fusion you inherit 
nothing.” 

“Term life insurance,” she 
answered. “That’s their bonus. Life 
and commissions. You live off the 
commissions, of course. But if you 
die—” 

“Enough, child. The longer I 
listen to you the worse 1 feel. I’m 
not going near any — ” 

“Suit yourself,” she said. “We’ll 
run out of money tomorrow.” 

“Tomorrow? There’s enough for 
at least another week.” 

“You forget you have a family to 
support. Two don’t live as cheaply 
as one, you know.” She paused, 
serious and for the moment rather 
pretty in her brown-faced way. 
“Fisk, it’s a good chance for you. I 
thought you’d really go for a decent 
income — ” 

Fisk sighed. “I’ll talk to the man. 
But it had better be strictly 
salesroom. If I hhve to go near a 
living Fusion I’ll resign on the 
spot.” 

“Sure,” she said. “Come on— 
you’re due to report in twenty 
minutes.” 

iiTyiSK CENTERS? Right,” 
the executive at Fusion 
Motors said briskly as Fisk intro- 
duced himself. “Your daughter 



here set it up. Glad to have a man 
of your experience with us.” 
“Experience? 1 haven’t — ” 

Yola tromped his toe and Fisk 
realized that she had invented suit- 
able qualifications for him. Time 
to set that straight right now. .He 
took a breath. 

“You’re in the weekly Hurdle, 
starting at ten today,” the man 
said. 

Fisk’s breath wooshed out. “I beg 
your — ” 

The man guided him out through 
a service e^it, led him into a mas- 
sive garage filled with menacing 
machinery. “Bill, he’s here.” 

Fisk tried again. “Look, I don’t 
know what she told you, but I’m 
not—” 

“Here’s your co-pilot. Bill. Bill, 
this is Fisk. Used to be with Ferrari 
before the antipolluters closed 
down their commercial branch. 
Drove in the antarctic cross- 
country a couple times, maybe 
twenty years ago. Going to sell for 
us. I want him to get a real feel for 
the Fusion, but you’ll have to carry 
the burden this time.” 

“Great,” Bill said, shaking Fisk’s 
hand with a grip of steel and rub- 
ber. “Come on, Fisk. We’ve got 
just thirty-five minutes to blastoff 
and you’ll need briefing.” 

“But I— ” 

“Don’t get me wrong,” Bill said, 
hustling him along while Yola trot-

ted excitedly behind. “I’m not put- 
ting down your experience. But 
there’s been a lot of development in 
the past two decades and most of it 
has been led by Fusion. And the 
Hurdle is a real workout. If 
anything happens to me you’ll have 
to take over — because the finish 
line’s the only safe exifc Ever drive 
over five hundred before?” 

“Well, I — ” Then it occurred to 
Fisk that BiU wasn’t talking about 
distance and certainly not about 
regular highway travel. Stunned, he 
fumbled for a suitable way to set 
things straightjmmediately. 

Yola caught up. She smiled 
sweetly at Bill. “Can I come, too? I 
love racing — ” 

Bill looked at her with leathery 
compassion. “Sorry, kid^ No jun- 
iors allowed. This is a rough 
course and it changes every week. 
You’ll have to watch it on the cus- 
tomer screen. Mine’s the purple 
Eight.” 

“Oh.” She looked dangerously 
sullen, but fell back. 

“Bill, there’s been a misunder- 
standing,” Fisk said, already out of 
breath because of the pace Bill was 
setting through the monstrous ga- 
rage. “I can’t — I never — ” 

“Here she is,” Bill said proudly, 
puUing up at a tremendous sculp- 
tured vehicle with eight massive 
wheels. “Hop in. We’ll get strapped 
while the tug takes her there. I’ll 



brief you while we’re-moving.” He 
gave Fisk h powerful boost into the 
open cockpit. 

The moment the twp men landed 
in the firm molded seats, the tug 
started hauling the car out of its 
niche and down a ramp. Bill saw to 
Fisk’s complex protective harness 
before attending to his own. 

“But I’m only supposed to be a 
salesman,” Fisk protested. “1 can’t 
get involved in a race. 1 have ab- 
solutely no — ” 

“No problem. Boss always 
breaks in the new men like this. 
Idea is you don’t need to know 
every detail about the car — jfou just 
have to believe in it absolutely, and 
the details will take care of 
themselves. So we don’t load you 
down with statistics and all that 
junk — we just show you. Once 
you’ve raced the Fusion Special 
you’re a believer.” 

“But I’m trying to tell you that 1 
don’t know the first thing about — ” 

“Sure. The boss explained. 
You’ve never touched the Fusion 
before. And twenty years is a long, 
long time in racing. We’d have let 
you sit it out this week, but my 
regular co-pilot isn’t out of the hos- 
pital yet. But I know you’ve got the 
stuff. 1 used to watch that antarctic 
cross-country when I was a kid. 
Those glaciers, those ice cre- 
vasses — ” He shook his head. 
“Hell, the hurdle isn’t rougher than

that. But it is different — and you’ve 
got to ride it several times before 
you get the feel. So I’ll drive and 
you just handle the map — okay? 
Nobody tackles a new race in a new 
car cold.” 

Al^PALLED, Fisk could only 
XXnod. At this point it almost 
seemed better to take the horrible 
ride and keep his mouth shut. At 
least the driver was competent and 
it would be a one-time experience. 

“Actually, that map is impor- 
tant,” Bill said consolingly. “I can’t 
take my eyes off the track when I’m 
at speed. They do it that way to 
make sure the race stays fair. New 
track for each run — nobody knows 
the specific layout until the race 
starts and then he has to figure his 
strategy from the map. Yours is a 
necessary job and don’t you doubt 
it for a moment. One misreading 
and we’re dead.” 

Fisk came to an abrupt deci- 
sion — he would blurt out the truth 
and get released from this race right 
now. “Bill, I—” 

“I wouldn’t drive without a 
mapman. My co-pilot tried that a 
couple weeks ago, when I was out 
at the last minute with intestinal 
grippe. You know — bathroom 

every ten minutes, ready or not. 
Didn’t dare drive. So he took it 
alone, because you can’t get a re- 
placement at the last moment and 



we didn’t want our entry scratched. 
That’^ why he cradled up — trying 
to read the map before he got of the 
tunnel — ” Bill shook his head. 
“Fifteen hours in surgery and he’ll 
have to drive next time with a pros- 
thetic hand and a plate ii) his skull. 
Ran over his insurance and he’s got 
a family to support. That’s why I 
have to rim a good race this time. 
Got to help him out.” 

Fisk realized that if he spoke out 
now Bill would have no co-pilot. 
Then he would have either to take it 
alone, risking the same fate that 
had wiped out his partner, or drop 
out of the race entirely. Then his 
friend’s medical bills would ruin his 
family. 

Fisk well understood the prob- 
lems of financial ruin. He had been 
a moderately wealthy man not so 
long ago. Being broke was not a 
fate he would wish on anyone. 

“. true dual-purpose car,”'Bill 
was saying. He evidently liked to 
talk. “Motor’s always at full 
power, of course, so the clutch 
guides it. Not the kind of clutch you 
knew, eh? No gearing. Just engage 
for the percentage of power you 
want. Depress gently and you’ve 
got a gentle touring car. Goose it 
and you’ve got a real racer. I use a 
model just like this for city 
traffic — ” 

What could Fisk do but stick 
with it? Racing terrified him and

not just because of his health — but 
more was riding on this race than 
his preferences. 

. duplicate controls, but yours 
will be inactive. Except for the indi- 
cators — you need to watch them in 
case of emergency. Regular 
steering wheel, you see; nothing 
complicated. Fusion’s designed for 
the simple-minded — that’s why I 
like it. And over here — ” 

The tug was maneuvering the car 
into the starting stall. A giant chro- 
nometer above was ticking off the 
last seconds before the start. Fisk 
squitmed in his harness, feeling 
cold sweat on his palms, face and 
underarms. He hoped that the term 
insurance was for a large amount. 

“The map will fall into the fax 
hopper there as the gun goes off,’’ 
Bill said. “Grab it and — ’’ 

A FAINT pop came through the 
. armored hull. Paper dropped. 
And the car ground forward with 
such authority that it was all Fisk 
could do to breathe. There was very 
little noise. Pollution-control had 
realty clamped down on loud sports 
jobs; both the hydrogen/helium 
fusion engine and the mercury 
vapor working fluid were almost 
silenu Also, it seemed, the cockpit 
was soundproof. 

Fisk had to admit it — this was a 
nice piece of machinery. 

Competing cars shot out of their 



stalls. Blue, white, green, red yel- 
low — internal combustion, steam, 
electric, jet, atomic and assorted 
hybrids. The car industry had 
claimed that stifl* antipollution 
standards would ruin it, but in fact 
they had led to a marvelous 
flbwering of superior new types. 
The money that had once been 
wasted on planned, obsolescence of 
style now went into improvement of 
mechanics. Drivers still had to buy 
a new car every three years, but 
now they obtained a superior 
product in each new model. And 
this was where that superiority 
was demonstrated — in professional 
competition, using the cars sold in 
the showrooms. It was a drag race 
start: thirty bright vehicles 

straining forward on a ten-mile 
straightaway. No noise or fumes. 

Fisk sneaked a look at the 
speedometer. His duplicate was 
functioning, but it took him a 
moment to find the mph scale 
among the massed dials and digits. 
The main readings were feet per 
second and kilometers per hour, but 
he was pedestrian enough to orient 
on old-fashioned miles per hour. 
They were already doing ISO, and 
accelerating rapidly. And the other 
cars were keeping pace or pulling 
ahead, so that the group velocity 
was deceptive. 

“Look at the map,’’ Bill shouted. 
“What’s the first hurdle?’’ 



124 



IF 




Fisk opened the map hastily and 
scanned it. He had been day- 
dreaming while his very life was at 
stake in an obstacle race at Hun- 
dreds of miles per hour. 

“The Narrows,” he said. 

“The Narrows? That’s a stiff lo- 
cation, but good for us. Hang on — 
we’ll have to push it.” 

And, astonishingly, the ac- 
celeration increased. The Fusion 
began gaining on other cars. 

“I thought you were all-out be- 
fore,” Fisk gasped. 

“Hardly. This is the finest car 
ever made, overall. The Fusion’s 
got more actual muscle than any 
car on the market — and unlimited 
range. It has a little piece of the sun 
inside, you know — that’s the heat 
of the conversion, four hydrogen 
atoms transforming into one he- 
lium atom in controlled fusion. 
Fuel’s no problem — it’s loaded 
when we make it and it runs on just 
a little bit of hydrogen until the car 
is junked. We have no top speed, 
really — car would shake apart be- 
fore we ever reached maximum. 
Only limiting factor — oh, don’t 
worry, we won’t shake apart — in a 
race like this is the frictive surface: 
the tires. That’s why we’ve got 
eight — and they’re broad ones, too. 
But too much acceleration makes 
them skid a bit and that’s bad for 
control and worse for wear. Got to 
save the rubber or we’ll have 



trouble finishing, even though the 
tires are solid. Guess you were still 
on pneumatics in the antarctic, 
huh?” 

“I guess.” Fisk realized that he 
had just received lesson one in 
Fusion salesmanship. The car was 
so powerful that even solid com- 
position tires could wear out of 
round in the course of an hour. 

And Bill was taking that risk 
now. The Fusion was overhauling 
car after car. The speedometer 
read — Fisk looked again, as- 
tonished — 390 mph . 395 . 400 
and still rising. Air whistled past 
the little winglike vanes on the sides 
that were necessary for control at 
such velocity — even the sound- 
prooftng could not eliminate every 
vestige of that hurricane keening. 
410 mph . 

Bill was right. Telling a pros- 
pective salesman about the Fusion 
could not have been nearly as effi- 
cient as showing him, regardless of 
his presunied experience. When he 
got into the showroom and a cus- 
tomer asked him about power and 
speed Fisk would not need any ar- 
tifice to describe the car. He had 
seen it in action, seen the other 
racers falling behind at 430 .

« OU' haven’t raced before,” 
X Bill observed mildly.

And it was out at last^too late. 
“I tried to tell you, but—” 
Bill smiled. “But you’re a sucker 
for a sob story.” 

“Oh-oh. You mean to say your 
co-pilot didn’t — ” 

“No, he did, all right. I do need 
this money for him. But nine men 
out of ten would not risk their own 
necks in a grind like this to help out 
someone they’d never seen. You’re 
too soft-hearted. I’ll bet you’ve 
been stepped on more than once or 
you wouldn’t be looking for a job at 
your age.” 

“Close enough.” 

“Don’t worry about it, Fisk. Lots 
of people sneer because they 
haven’t got the guts to be decent 
when the heat is on. I knew you 
weren’t a racer the moment I saw 
you. You don’t have racer’s ways. 
But I wasn’t going to embarrass the 
boss right before a race — and 1 did 
need a mapman.” 

“And you’re a bit soft yourself,” 
Fisk said. “Helping your friend, 
sparing your boss, giving me a 
chance at a JobL-’’ 

Bill laughed easily. “Takes one to 
know one, doesn’t it? Little girl set 
it up, right? Wanted her daddy to 
be a big man? Well, you are one — 
and not because of any fancy race. 
Gpt a child like that myself— 
wouldn’t trade her. No, I’ll cover 
for you, Fisk. They can’t hear us 
here. Only contact is the radio and 



that’s one-way — in. On the public 
band. So no driver can sneak in tac- 
tical info during the race. You’re an 
honest man and I like that, so I 
stopped you from making an ass of 
yourself, or seeming to. Man quits 
a race at the start, the word spreads 
that he’s chicken, no matter what 
the facts. After this you’ll be a racer 
officially — and nobody has to know 
the difference.” 

Fisk was beginning to find the 
man’s solicitude a bit confining. 
“But it isn’t honest to — ” 

“It isn’t right to make a scene 
right before a race, embarrassing 
the company and hurting the little 
girl’s feelings. Got to choose your 
course in a hurry — even when the 
best one is ragged. That’s racing. I 
-figured more people would be bet- 
ter oft this way, so this is how I 
played it. Okay?” 

What was there to say? 

“Okay,” Fisk agreed reluctantly. 

Then he saw the end of the track: 
slanting walls of concrete foam nar- 
rowed the thirty-car highway into 
twenty, ten, five lanes. Bill ma- 
neuvered the vehicle around the few 
remaining leaders with minute but 
expert turns of his steering wheel 
that nevertheless brought anguished 
squeals from the massive tires. At 
500 mph he passed his last com- 
petitor and slammed into the Nar- 
rows. 

“New leader and winner of the 



126 



IF 




first heat. Fusion!” a voice an- 
nounced. Fisk jumped, then 
realized that it was the car radio. 
The race was being broadcast to the 
sports fans of the world. 

“Sales: Fusion twenty-four, 

Steamco nineteen, Dupeijet 
seventeen—” 

“Hear that?” Bill cried happily. 
“The sales foUow the performance, 
roughly. Usually the winner of a 
Hurdle is good for a hundred and 
fifty contracts or more right during 
the race. Much more if something 
spectacular happens. We’re ahead 
where it counts.” 

Fisk was amazed. “You mean 
people are buying cars while they 
watch?” 

“They sure are. When a car 
makes a good move, the saleslines 
light up. Impulse buyers. Want to 
own a car with class. We’re selling 
Fusions fight now, Fisk — one per 
cent commission on the gross goes 
to the driver. Five hundred dollars 
per unit, if they take the Special — 
less for the tamer models, though 
no Fusion is really tame. If I run 
well this time and sell a hundred 
cars — ^that’s twenty-five grand. 
Pretty good for a week’s pay. Of 
course I don’t always finish — then I 
get nothing. And most races I make 
less than ten grand when I do place. 
And I’d have to finish at least 
second or third just to cover my 
friend’s medical expenses if I 



wanted to do it in one race. But it’s 
a living. I figure to retire after I 
make one really big killing — if it 
isn’t myself I’m killing.” 

« T SEE,” Fisk said, chilled by 
X the concept and by the 
rapidly closing walls of the Nar- 
rows. Five hundred miles per hour 
was an outrageous speed for a car 
and now that there was something 
to measure it against outside . 

“Oh, sorry — I didn’t mean to rub 
it in, pal. You aren’t a regular 
driver, so that commission doesn’t 
apply to you. But I’ll tell them you 
helped a lot and if we do well the 
company’ll give you a 'nice starting 
bonus. Your commissions will 
come niostly from your showroom 
sales.” 

Fisk’s concern had been about 
the danger, not the money, but he 
didn’t push the matter. 

Bill braked, using small para- 
chutes that blossomed and~dragged 
behind the car. They provided a 
steady reduction of speed without 
sluing. Fisk was glad they did. 
The Narrows, according to the 
map, was a one-lane chute with 
thick twelve-foot-high barricades 
on either side. No vehicle could 
pass another here and some of the 
curves could be disastrous at peak 
velocity. 

Studying the map at this point 
was foolish — Fisk raised his eyes to 



HURDLE 



127 




his surroundings. The crisscrossed 
timbers were invisible at this range, 
merely a graying of the view, but he 
knew they were timbers of steel. 
Speed here was less essential than 
control. Any accident would block 
the Najrows. Bill had ensured his 
own passage and placement by en- 
tering first. 

A faint rattle sounded in the car. 
Bill cocked an ear alertly. "'Check 
your gauges, he snapped to Fisk. 
“Probably that was an irregularity 
in the track — felt like it. But just in 
case—’" 

Fisk scanned the dials and lights. 
“AU green and in normal range.” 

“Right. Some of these buggies 
are more maneuv^able at speed,” 
Bill explained as he sweated the 
Fusion down and through. “They 
could leave us behind on a track 
like this — if they could pass us. 
We’re heavy and prone to chassis 
stresses. Not the fault of the car — 
it’s inherent in the mass and much 
of that mass is shielding that we 
simply have to have. If any of those 
other cars carried our weight 
penalty they wouldn’t have a 
chance in this race. But here in the 
Narrows we lose no ground. If 
anything’s wrong we can slow down 
and check it out. Next straightaway 
we’ll show ’em dust! What’s next on 
the map?” 

“Hairpin.” 

“Say, we’re really in luck! That’s 



our worst time loser and now we’ve 
got first crack at it. The big ugly 
god of Hurdle racers must be 
smiling on us. We might even win 
this one, baby!” 

Bill continued to slow, but even at 
ISO the huge racer skewed and 
tilted on the gentle curves, alarming 
Fisk. 

They shot out of the Narrows and 
into Hairpin at a comparative crawl 
of 120 mph. Bill slued into the ap- 
proach, deliberately skidding the 
rear wheels and braking. The car 
behind the Fusion was a jet. Fisk 
watched it in the rear-view screen 
so as not to have to watch the 
nightmare ahead. He knew the jet’s 
wheels were merely for^ support. 
The only thing that stopped it from 
being a flyaway winner on the 
straightaway was the pollution 
damping — its flaming exhaust had 
to meet almost prohibitive stan- 
dards of emission control. It was, of 
course, chemically fueled and could 
not travel as far as the Fusion. 

Bill whipped around another kil- 
ler bend of the Hairpin at 90 while 
metal groaned and dirt flew wide. 
Fisk thought he heard another rat- 
tling, but decided that it was caused 
by the spray of pebbles thrown up 
against the bottom of the vehicle. 
Outside each curve was a six-foot 
drop-off onto an escape lane — the 
turn had to be made tightly for 
there was no second chance. 



128 



IF 




“Fusion still leads," the radio 
announced. “Excellent tactics in 
a slow second heat. Sales; Fu- 
sion twenty-six, Duperjet twenty- 
one . 

“Not much pickup on the Nar- 
rows,'' Bill explained in frag- 
mentary fashion between the body- 
smashing maneuvers. He was heel- 
and-toeing it now, working acceler- 
ator clutch and wheelbrake almost 
simultaneously with his right foot 
while his left controlled the 
movable windvanes for additional 
control. The parachute brakes had 
been jettisoned — they could not be 
turned on and off like this. Fisk was 
amazed Bill still had concentration 
for chatter while performing such 
heroic feats. “I held up the line. 
Crowd likes action. But we're in 
good field position. Watch us go 
once we pass Hairpin." 

He braked down to 60 for the 
sharpest bend. Fisk thought the 
turn impossible — it looked like the 
point of a knife. 

And somepne rah out into the 
track. 

F isk became faint with horror, 
but Bill's reaction time was like 
an old-fashioned mousetrap. He 
swerved to miss the figure, 
throwing the car into a four-wheel 
tilt, and careened off the bank to 
drop into the escape^ lane. The two 
men bounced like yayos in their 



harnesses as the great car landed, 
but they and it took the fall without 
physical damage. 

The jet following did likewise, 
landing more gently because it had 
only half the Fusion's mass. It 
pulled up even. 

The lane had no passing room. 
The cars jostled together and spun. 
The side vane of the jet cut through 
the Fusion's bubble top, opening a 
neat incision in the shatterproof 
material. Then the lighter car shot 
ahead, reorienting in a fine display 
of equilibrium and blasting back 
down the intercept lane to rejoin the 
race. Missing a turn did not, it 
seemed, disqualify a car but merely 
delayed it. 

Already three other cars had 
navigated this fold of the H^pin 
and more were coming. The dust 
was rising higher as the road 
eroded. The remaining entries 
would be taking the curve virtually 
blind — another disadvantage of 
trailing the leaders. 

Bill guided the car to a safe slow- 
down, then slapped a hand to his 
head. "Get her moving," he said 
thickly. "The—" 

Fisk saw blood. 

"My controls don’t — " he began, 
but paused as he saw Bill slump. 
How badly had the man been in- 
jured? The harness prevented him 
from looking more closely. 

"New leader," the radio an- 



HURDLE 



129 




nounced. “Fusion and Dupeijet 
spun out on Hairpin. Steamco is 
now first. Sales: Steamco thirty- 
two, Fusion — one moment, the can- 
cellations are still coming in — 
Fusion twenty-one, Dupererjet 
fifteen . 

The car was blocking the sole es- 
cape lane. Any car that missed the 
turn would shoot right this way at 
sixty or better, probably out of con- 
trol. The ballooning dust guar- 
anteed that the on-rushing vehicle 
would not see the Fusion in time to 
stop, even if it were in condition to 
do so. 

Something knocked on the bub- 
bel and for a heartbeat Fisk 
thought a collision had already oc- 
curred. But the figure who had 
started this disaster by mate- 
rializing in the forbidden territory 
of the Hurdle Hairpin had remate- 
rialized and was dancing outside. 
This time Fisk recognized her. 

“Yola!” he cried in dismay. He 
should have known. 

She yelled something, he couldn’t 
make out in the confusion. Then 
she pointed at Bill. 

“Duperjet clipped him, thanks to 
you — ’’ Fisk shouted. 

“Fisk, let me in!” Her voice came 
through the unnatural vent. 

He found the canopy switch on 
Bill’s side and jerked it. The bub- 
bletop yanked itself up, its ripped 
portion catching, then springing 



loose. Yola jumped about inside. 

“Close up and get rolling,” she 
ordered, settling into Bill’s inert 
lap. “First car that misses that 
pretzel — pow!” 

An apt summation.- “But I 
can’t — my controls don’t — ” 

“Don’t give me that. You’ll kill 
us all — ” She looked back. “Here 
comes one now!” 

Fisk’s hand found the changeover 
switch and his foot came down on 
the accelerator clutch. The car 
lunged aimlessly, all eight whebls 
spinning in the dirt. He grabbed at 
the steering wheel, easing up 
enough on the clutch to let the 
wheels catch. 

“But there’s nowhere to go — ” he 
protested belatedly. 

“Back on the main track, stupid! 
We’ve got to get this guy to a 
doctor. He’s bleeding — ” 

And Fisk was somehow guiding 
the behemoth down the track at 
rapidly accelerating velocity. His 
lightest pressure on the pedal 
elicited a surge of brute animation 
that was frightening in its strength. 
No car was behind — that had been 
a false alarm. But ^e knew they 
could not have remained in the es- 
cape lane — and Yola was right 
about Bill. The man was hurt and 
every minute that kept him from 
medical attention might reduce his 
chances of survival. The only way 
out was straight ahead. 



130 



IF 




T hen a car did appear in the 
escape lane, nosing out of thcL. 
dust cloud as though from a broWn 
tunnel, and Fisk involuntarily 
goosed the Fusion back onto the 
main track, his tires screaming as 
he turned. Fortunately for hijn 
there were no further hairpin loops. 

“What are we in for next?” he 
asked her, his hands sweating. He 
was moving the monster — but how 
long could he control it? Every time 
he pushed down on the pedal the 
wheels destroyed themselves a little 
in their effort to accelerate the ve- 
hicle instantly. But it was either 
ride this tiger or be smashed flat by 
the one following. 

Yola scrabbled for the map, 
which had strewn itself across 
Fisk’s feet. “The Elevated,” she 
said. “Better get up speed.” 

“No, thank you. I’m doing eighty 
now— and I know my limits. We’re 
just going to limp out the safest way 
we can find and — what were you 
doing on the track, anyway?” 

“Have it your way,” she said with 
affected nonchalance. “But I’m a 
race fan from way back and I think 
you’d better get it up. Ever see the 
El on the newscreen?” 

“Brilliant recovery by Duperjet,” 
the radio blared. “Fusion is not out 
of the race, but trails the pack and 
is moving erratically. Sales: Du- 
V perjet fifty-five, Steamco forty- 
nine, Gasturb thirty . .” 



“Never watched sports.” He 
Jooked around nervously. “Look, 
Yola— Bill’s a nice guy and it’s 
your fault he’s hurt. See if you can 
bandage him up — or something.” 

“What do I know about first- 
aid?” she demanded as rebelliously 
^s always when told to do some- 
thing. But she began looking in the 
car pocket^ for the medical sup- 
plies that had to be there. 

“ . and Fusion twelve — no, 
ten.” 

Fisk saw what lay ahead of them. 
“That?” 

“What do you think? Watch 
those cars behind you.” 

Fisk saw them come up on him at 
an alarming clip as they navigated 
the last of Hairpin and accelerated. 
The track was widening here, but 
one slow vehicle could be disaster. 
He speeded up. 

Yola found a rolled bandage and 
began stretching it out. Fisk knew 
her hands were dirty — they always 
were^but kept his peace. Infection 
was the least of his present 
concerns. “We’re taking a beating 
at the box office,” she said. “But 
we’re still in the race and we’re not 
last either. Yet.” 

Still the cars came, showing no 
inclination to avoid a possible 
crash. Fisk’s adrenalin squirted. He 
stamped down hard and the car 
surged forward as though its speed 
of a hundred miles per hour had 



HURDLE 



131 




been mere idling. It was a fine piece 
of machinery and it could hardly 
perform like this if it had suffered 
mechanical damage in the accident. 
There was, indeed, a certain exhila- 
ration in managing a brute like this, 
Fisk discovered. / 

They were booming up the steep 
approach ramp of the Elevated. 
The combination of acceleration 
and angle shoved the riders back 
into their seats, hard. Yola 
balanced precariously and Fisk felt 
the first twinge of nausea. He had a 
circulatory disorder that could be 
aggravated by sustained physical 
stress. Ordinarily it didn’t bother 
him — token medication kept the 
symptoms suppressed — but ordi- 
narily he didn’t tackle obstacle 
races in SOO-mph juggernauts. 

Yola complained, *^His neck is all 
icky with hair and gore — I can’t 
make the bandage stay.” 

“Then hold it in place with your 
hand,” Fisk rasped, resenting the 
need to split his concentration aiid 
expend his breath in a situation like 
this. “We’ve got to keep him from 
bleeding too much. If Bill hadn’t 
swerved to avoid you — ” 

She uttered a monosyllable Fisk 
didn’t recognize — fortunately. He 
was pretty sure it would have 
earned her another week in solitary 
back at the orphanage from whence 
she sprang. But somehow she Fixed 
the bandage in place. 



T hen they were up, other cars 
ahead and behind. Ahead also 
stretched mind-numbing miles of 
twisted ribbon, five hundred feet 
above the ground, tapering into a 
thread in the distance, though it 
was four lanes wide. 

Two following cars charged past, 
the whine of their tires momentarily 
loud. The odor of oil and hot rub- 
beroid swirled in through the rent in 
the bubble. 

Yola sneezed. “There can’t be 
many more behind us,” she mut- 
tered, torn between hope and 
regret. She clung to the straps of 
Bill’s harness as the incoming gusts 
swept black hair across her brown 
face. “But don’t stop now — you 
have to take the El at speed or you 
fait off.” 

She was speaking literally. The 
paving contorted like a living tape- 
worm, given animation by his speed 
of 170 mph. In addition, the hole in 
the bubble interfered with the 
streamline contour and created a 
dangerous drag that Fisk seemed to 
feel all the way down to the sliding 
tires. But their forward momentum 
was not enough. The road tilted 
now into a forty-five degree em- 
bankment— -he would indeed fall off 
unless he maintained speed suffi- 
cient to match the needs of the 
curve. 

“Yeah,” Yola said, licking her 
lips. At eleven, with her deprived

IF 




background, she, was more enthu- 
siastic than afraid. He hadn’t really 
needed to ask why she had sneaked 
into the racegrounds. She had done 
so because it was forbidden. She 
had wanted a ride and now she had 
it. Quite possibly her last. 

More wind blasted in as he ac- 
celerated. “Close up that hole,’’ 
Fisk snapped as another warning 
wave of dizziness came over him. 
The blood circulation to his brain 
was being inhibited— but to stop 
was to die. Already they were 
sliding toward the nether perimeter 
and the drag was making matters 
worse. He had to keep turning the 
wheel and bearing down on the 
pedal to counter the drift. But if he 
accelerated too strongly and broke 
the wheels free of the surface . 

“Don’t tell me what to do!’’ Yola 
flared. 

Fisk twitched the wheel the other 
way. The Fusion jerked toward the 
rail. The bright water of a scenic 
lake spread helow — a natural safety 
net. But they could drown, for the 
massive car would plummet to the 
bottom. 

“Okay! Okay!’’ she exclaimed 
with bad grace. “You’re the 
driver — ’’ She dug out some 
harness strap and additional 
bandage and wedged the mass into 
the gap. It helped. 

Now Fisk was able to gain the 
speed he needed: 200 . 2S0 . 



280 — finally the drift abated and 
they were cruising in a kind of 
stasis. It was, actually, rather 
pleasant in its way — the velocity 
anesthetized his sense of proportion 
and the balancing forces lulled his 
circulatory incapacity. What re- 
mained was a growing sense of 
well-being and power. He was no 
longer Fisk the hard-sell sucker — 
he was Fisk the Supreme! The 
Secret Life of Fisk Centers . 

Then the curvature and banking 
reversed. 

Fisk was driving for his life and 
there was suddenly no joy in it. He 
slued across the strip at 300 mph 
without any exact knowledge where 
he was going or how long he could 
last. His brain tried to black out. 
He tilted his head back as far as he 
could, trying to let the blood in his 
system flow level to the gray region 
that needed it. 

“Slow up! Speed down!’’ Yola 
screamed. “Watch the sky ^low!’’ 
Which was just about the way Fisk 
saw it. 

“Duperjet is still the leader,’’ the 
radio announced. “Sales: Duperjet 
seventy-eight, Steantco sixty. 
Electro forty-four . .’’ 

T he tilt decreased and the car 
was rolling down the steep exit 
slope at 3S0 mph. Fisk knew there 
had been many miles of elevated 
ribbon and that he had covered 



HURDLE 



133 




every twist at daredevil speed, but 
his memory had a short-term blank 
on the subject. That was fortunate 
for his equanimity, ^infortunate for 
his security, since memory lapse 
was another signal of his functional 
impairment. Nothing but blind re- 
flex had carried him through, but 
before long his reflexes would cut 
out, too. 

Yola sat silent and staring. The 
ride must have been good to faze 
her like that, Fisk thought. 

“ . Fusion thirteen . .” 

At the foot of the ramp was an 
impenetrable bank of fog. The road 
led directly into it. 

Fisk sighed. No way to avoid it. 
This was obviously part of the 
course. Another hurdle. He turned 
on lights, searing beams of 
brilliance that might well have been 
windowed from the solar activity of 
the engine, but the best they could 
do here was about two hundred 
feet. The car was moving at more 
than five hundred feet per second, 
according to the relevant scale of 
the speedometer — 360 mph. How 
many seconds >^uld it take him to 
come to a stop? 

He applied the brakes. The car 
slowed with neck-wrenching sud- 
denness. Bill groaned. /Good — the 
sound proved he was alive. The 
smell of burning rubberoid infil- 
trated from somewhere. 

“Keep moving!” Yola screamed. 



“Fogbank always has stuff in it — ” 

A gap opened in the road. By the 
time Fisk reacted, it was too late to 
react. The car hurtled the twenty 
foot void with no more than a nasty 
jolt. 

“Try that at half the speed,” 
Yola muttered faintly. 

Fisk had to agree with her. Un- 
dervelocity was just as dangerous 
here as overvelocity. His con- 
servative course was to maintain 
middle-range speed — say 300 mph. 

A wall appeared, made of stone 
and steel by its look. 

Fisk swerved left barely in time. 
The wall was oblique, cutting 
across the lane only gradually, right 
to left. His instinct had been accu- 
rate and he had dodged the hurdle. 

“Try that at half speed,” he 
mimicked. 

“Luck,” Yola said disparagingly, 
as though her own life were not part 
of the stakes. 

Not all of the fog was outside. 
Fisk’s arms were becoming leaden 
on the wheel and his eyelids felt 
heavy. His system had taken just 
about all it was going to. He was 
out of adrenalin. Wisps of cloud 
passed between his face and the 
instrument panel — or perhaps 
between his eyes and brain. 

“Wake up!” Yola screamed. 

Fisk snapped alert, laughing — 
and momentarily felt refreshed, 
ready to continue another couple of 



134 



IF 




minutes. He was giving Yola all the 
thrills she had asked for — and 
more. 

“Duperjet is out of the race,” the 
radio announced. “Crackup in the 
Slalom—” 

Fisk bounced over a washboard 
trap and emerged from the fog. 
Fogbank hadn’t actually been so 
bad. It would have been another 
matter in the press of the pack, 
however: 

T hey were out of the fog and 
into a forest. Green concrete 
pseudotrees or pilings rose from the 
highway in a seemingly solid mass. 
They were cold — ice had formed on 
them and snow coated the ground. 

“The Slalom,” Yola said de- 
spairingly. “Doom!” 

But the pilings were less impene- 
trable than they seemed from a 
distance. In the seconds it took to 
reach the first, Fisk saw that they 
were spaced well apart. There was 
room to skid around them if for- 
ward progress were not excessive. 
The tracks of many wheels showed 
the routes other cars had taken. 

But across the main trail were 
wheels themselves, and jagged 
pieces of metal — the debris of a 
recent accident strewed across the 
course. Dupeijet, surely. This was 
dangerous territory. 

”... Fusion nineteen . Du- 
perjet nine . .” 



The buyers certainly had little 
sympathy for a loser. Yet Dupeijet 
was a flne car. It had led the pack 
after that spinout. Fusion was re- 
covering sales — but what a grisly 
way to succeed. 

Fisk was falling under the sway 
of stress fatigue again. He willed his 
remaining strength into his hands 
and aimed the vehicle at the widest 
aperture between groups of pilings, 
following the common trail, Here 
and there the refrigerative grid 
showed, scraped temporarily bare 
by the passage of the pack, giving 
him slightly improved footing. He 
was still doing over 300 mph and he 
knew better than to attempt to 
change speed here^ 

Yola covered her eyes. “You 
drive like a zombie,” she said. 

The trail split. A piling lay dead 
ahead. Fisk forced a message down 
along the resistive nerve tissue of 
his right arm and the arm convulsed 
a bit, pulling the wheel around just 
that necessary fraction. The car 
slued, scraping against the piling 
on the left and almost disloging 
Yola’s hole-stufTing. At this point 
Fisk hardly cared — it was as 
though car and racetrack were far 
away. Even his own extremities 
were, almost beyond reach. His 
heart was laboring to the point of 
collapse, but the life-sustaining 
blood was not getting through. He 
was numb and terribly tired. 



HURDLE 



135 




Yet he would not let go entirely. 
He hung on. A thin rivulet of ani- 
mation trickled along the buried 
conduits of his pallid flesh. As the 
pilings loomed his muscles twitched 
and the car shaved by, never quite 
hitting, never quite sacriFicing the 
tfaction so necessary to keep it 
from following the Duperjet into 
destruction. But Fusion’s huge 
mass gave it traction where a 
lighter car might have skated. The 
impact of their passage howled 
about the myriad death traps of the 
Slalom — if he had been the lyrical 
type he might have immortalized 
the experience in poetry — and then 
they were out of it. 

“We’re alive,” Yola whispered, 
amazed. “At least I am. For a while 
I almost wished I was back at the 
orphanage.” She looked at Fisk. 
“You can stop here. We’re out of 
the woods and nobody’s behind us 
any more.” 

Fisk ignored her. Now he faced a 
straightaway, long and level and 
dry. Far ahead he could see several 
other cars. The Fusion had actually 
gained on them during this last 
hurdle. The race wasn’t over yet — 
and as long as he was in it, why not 
win it? 

Ill 

I T WAS madness, he knew — the 
futile delusion of grandeur of an 



oxygen-starved brain, its frontal 
lobes anesthetized. He didn’t care. 

^ Bill needed a large sales tally for his 
friend’s medical bills — and perhaps 
for his own. Fisk was indirectly 
responsible for the Fusion's fall 
from first to last place in the 
Hurdle and for Bill’s injury. There 
was power under his foot if not in 
his body or brain. Why not invoke 
it, double or nothing? 

“Daddy, what are you doing?” 
Yola whispered as the car 
accelerated. 

“You wilful little brat — you got 
me into this,” he snapped. “Now 
you’re going to see it through.” 

He was mad — insane, not angry. 
His brain had gone berserk and was 
running faster than the car. He had 
never suffered this effect of his 
malady before. It was as though 
another personality had fought to 
the surface — a completely un-Fisk 
monster. No, not true. This was his 
true personality. Shackled by 
decades of civilized restraint, it had 
emerged at last. 

“So it’s like that. Centers,” Yola 
muttered. “Well, want to know 
what’s next? The MTountain.” 

Fisk-normal quailed, but the 
demon aspect who had usurped 
control' of his body said in fine de- 
tergent-opera fashion, “Yeah? So 
watch this.” And his right foot 
crunched down harder. 

The speedometer read 400 mph. 



136 



IF 




It climbed rapidly as the tireless 
machine obeyed the imperious 
command of a lunatic. 

“Steamco eighty-six. Electro 
fifty-nine, Gasturb forty-nine . 
the radio said and continued on 
through the entire list of twenty-six 
cars remaining in the race. Fusion 
was back up to twenty-four. 

The car was doing 500 now and 
Fisk’s foot was a marvel of unre- 
mitting ponderosity. This was a 
fair-sized straightaway — the kind 
where power counted. Fusion’s fa- 
vorite track. The gap between him 
and the pack was closing. How 
much would this buggy do? 

“This is suicide,’’ a small voice 
whimpered. At first Fisk thought it 
was that of his civilized-self 
conscience, but it turned out to be 
Yola’s. 

Fisk’s eyeballs seemed to be 
locked in their sockets, able to 
move only marginally to cover the 
contours of the road. He himself 
was a machine, his arms levering 
more or less together, sharing his 
drastically limitecL muscular power 
as though connected by an old- 
fashioned limited-slip differential. 

600 mph . 

Suddenly the straightaway was 
ending and he was overhauling the 
pack at a phenomenal clip. The 
demon in him exulted. 

“You fool — it’s the Mountain!’’ 
Yola screamed, afraid. But Fisk 



saw only his beautiful passing of 
competitors on the fast track. So 
they had written off Fusion, had 
they? 

Then his foot came up involun- 
tarily. Yola was down beside the 
pedal, prying it loose. And the pack 
moved ahead again and crammed 
like so much floating refuse into the 
drain-like access to the next hurdle. 

“Fusion has merged with the 
pack.’’ The radio sounded sur- 
prised. “Looked for a moment 
there as if— but the driver was too 
smart to risk a pass on Mountain. 
We thought Fusion had mechanical 
trouble, but obviously not| Sales: 
Steamco a hundred and one . 
Electro seventy-five, Gasturb fifty- 
five, Vaporlock forty-four, Fusion 
thirty-eight ...” 

“Wow!” Yola cried, forgetting 
her apprehension of the moment 
before. “You may be crazy, but 
we’re bacK in the sales niontiy! 
What’s your cut of the gross, 
Fisk?” 

He didn’t answer, knowing how 
little the money meant, compared 
to the lives depending on it. She had 
climbed back into Bill’s lap and 
Fisk’s foot was free, but now the 
ascent was too steep to permit high 
velc^ity. He trailed the pack at a 
poor 380 mph. - 

The course wedged into a two- 
lane thread, along which cars were 
spaced like traveling ants. A cliff

developed on the right, the drop-ofT 
becoming tall and sheer. A car 
ahead, trkdio pass another precipi- 
tously. The banking of the road 
reversed, throwing .it tdo faf out 
and the vehicle sailed into space to 
torpedo into the water trap below. 

**Coaldust slipped,” the radio 
cried. ‘Twenty-four cars remain in 
the race at the two-thirds point . .” 

The demon that now governed 
Fisk’s ailing body took note. A lot 
of cars would not finish because 
their drivers were too eager. He had 
better bide his time until he hit 
another straightaway. 

'Me^while, Mountain was a ter- 
ror. Visibility declined as the blind 
curves became sharper. A small 
thunderstorm was anchored at the 
crest,* peHiftg the entries with rain 
and hailstones. He had to slow to 
280 and pace himself by the car 
ahead through the blasting rain. 
TK|n 6ame the descent and Fisk ac- 
celerated down the glassy slope. 

“Steamco one-twenty-nine . 
Electro one-fourteen . Vapor- 
lock sixty-eight . Fusion fifty- 
nine . .” 

Fusion and Fisk were moving up 
on sales faster than on the pack, 
perhaps because the spectators 
knew what would happen on the 
next level heat, but not fast enough. 
The demon would settle for nothing 
less than total victory. 

”Oh-oh,” Yola said. “Loop’s 



coming next. Cool it, leadfoot.” 
Bill groaned again. He was 
showing signs of recovery. 

F ISK’S eyes were on the desert- 
like sandflat beyond. Gently 
rolling dunes were artfully placed to 
alleviate the monotony and impede 
progress — a straight-line route 
would necessarily take in several of 
them. The alternative was to waste 
time going around them. He had no 
idea of what it was like to drive on 
sand. But if the other cars could 
handle it, so could Fusion — and this 
might be its last chance to pass the 
pack before the finish. 

“Steamco still leads going into 
the Loop,” the radio said. “Pack’s 
pretty close and tight, though. 
There’s likely to be some 
action . .” 

Indeed there was. Fisk observed 
the Loop, nestled in the angle 
between the Mountain terminus 
and the Dunes plain. It seemed to 
be about three lanes wide — but the 
pack contained about fifteen cars 
^nd few of them were giving way to 
let the procession become orderly. 
The Fusion was gaining, but would 
strike the Loop just after the pack 
did. 

It didn’t look as though there 
were any inherent limit on speed 
here — the faster he went, the less 
likely he would be to fall off at the 
upsidedown apex, provided he had 



138 



IF 




the car under control. And as long 
as nothing got in his way. But could 
his defective body take the strain? 
The Fusion was willing — the flesh 
was weak. 

The first car hit the Loop. Up 
and over it went at some five 
hundred miles per hour, like a toy. 
Only car lengths behind it came the 
second, closing. Then, squeezing in 
two and three abreast, the pack, 
vying for position even as they en- 
countered the vertical ascent. And 
the Fusion was bearing down at SSO 
mph, still accelerating, still gaining. 

Steaihcb shot from the corkscrew 
exit and land^ on the fringe of the 
sandflaL Dust billowed up momen- 
tarily. Electro smacked into this 
and swerved, stirring up a greater 
cloud. Then the pack was tearing 
through like so many piranhas. 

Fisk was entering the Loop at 600 
mph. 

“Hang on!” -he yelled, though 
Yola needed no. warning. They 
smashed into the vertical curve and 
Fisk’s breath left him. This was in 
effect a ten- or fifteen-G takeoff, he 
was sure. He clutched at a painful 
gray awareness. 

“. spectacular crash!” the 
radio blared avidly and Fisk 
realized he had failed and could ex- 
pect nothing but agony before 
he died. “Pileup just beyond the 
Loop . .” 

Not me— someone else . 



He was headed up at ^50 .mph; 
The reality^ that kept, him fighting 
was the climbing needle^^-signifying 
conquest. 

Yota screamed tbinly. They were 
upside down, plummeting head- 
first, leveling, taking off, upside^ 
down, proceeding along the awful 
corkscrew of the Loop. Fisk shoved 
the pedal all the way to the floor, 
connecting engine to wheels 
without any bleeding of power. He 
rode the descent lane into ever in- 
creasing velocity.

seemed to strain. This was ultimate 
glory!

Dead ahead, half concealed by a. 
low dune and a sinking 4ust cloudy 
was the roadblock. Licks of flame 
shot up and smoke was piling into 
the sky. No chance to turn. A thou-

sand feet away — and in less than 
one second they were upon it, 
traveling at 750 mph, Fisk’s foot 
still savagely mashing^ the pedal. 
The Fusion was tearing itself apart 
and eradication was a microsecond 
away, but he would not even at- 
tempt to ease up. Already he was 
touching the vane-angle switch. 

T he low dune shoved the rub- 
beroid and metal aloft in a 
single mighty convulsion. The great 
wheels barely touched the flaming 
corpse of the nearest car. 

And they were airborne as the 
shaking became almost intolerable. 
Fumes siphoned in through the 
stuffed hole as the car was bathed in 
fire. The speedometer stood at 760. 
“Great God,’’ Vola screamed in a 
whisper. “We’ve cracked the speed 
of sound!’’ 

“Fusion is past!’’ the radio 
gasped. “Fusion hurdled pileup. .’’ 
The car landed, and sand swirled 
up behind it in little tornadoes 
spawned by the vacuum of their 
passage, but the mighty machine 
crunched on. The flames were far 
behind. Fisk’s hands and arms were 
senseless and stiff in a kind of living 
rigor mortis, but straight ahead was 
all the car needed in the way of a di- 
rective. Now at last his foot began 
to creep up from the pedal. 

“What — what?’’ a voice mum- 
bled. 



“Hey, he’s coming to,’’ Yola 
cried as Bill stirred. 

“Keep him quiet,’’ Fisk’s voice 
rasped. “We’re still doing six- 
ninety on sand — ’’ 

“Sales,’’ the radio said. 
“Steamco one-fifty-two . 

Fusion — one moment, it’s still 
changing — that feat of piloting 
really stirred up the — never saw 
anything like it. Fusion takes the 
lead in sales! Fusion one-seventy- 
,three . And Steamco— one 
moment — ’’ 

Bill lifted his head. “God, man, 
that’s near my best. What — ’’ 

“1 had to take over,’’ Fisk said 
tefsely. He was still fighting the 
rising tide of gray behind his eyes. 

“Yeah— but— ’’ 

“Revised sales,’’ the radio said. 
“Fusion two hundred and eight — 
folks, it’s still changing. We can’t 
get a fixed reading. The race isn’t 
even finished . Fusion two-forty- 
nine . two-sixty-one—’’ There 
was an unexplained pause, then: 
“Folks, to recap: there has been a 
nfteen-car collision on the Dunes 
just beyond the Loop, but the 
remaining cars are still running. 
Here’s the replay — ’’ ‘Another 
pause as the screen viewers saw the 
film. “Steamco retains the lead on 
the track, but that’s all — and 
Fusion is coming up fast. The 
others — seven cars, I believe — are 
picking their way around the

wreckage, avoiding the flames. 
None of them will finish in the 
money. It’s a two-car race! Fusion, 
not known for its maneuverability, 
pulled such an extraordinary feat 
of — Fusion three hundred and 
nineteen! Those orders are pouring 
in! Here’s the replay on that hurdle 
of death. That’s Fusion Firing out of 
the Loop — look at that! It cracked 
mach one! We thought the car was 
out of the running, then this! The 
buyers are really impressed. Hell, 
I’m impressed, and I’ve been in this 
business for — Most racers would 
have been smashed to pieces, 
busting sound like that, let alone 
doing it through flame! Fusion

Folks we can’t keep up. Un- 
precedented sales for an unfinished 
race. Looks like a record in the 
making, even if Fusion doesn’t win 
the Hurdle. Four-fifty-two ... I 
gotta buy one myself . .” The an- 
nouncer panted into silence. 

“That tells it,” Bill exclaimed. 
“Sweetest music f ever heard. And 
I thought you couldn’t drive — ” 

“I can’t,” Fisk said. “I’m sicker 
than yqu are.” 

Bill looked at him. “You’re white 
as bones — you have a heart condi- 
tion? I’ve lost some blood, but I’ve 
taken lumps before — better let me 
take over. Kid, get down on the 
floor or somewhere.” 

Yola scrambled down, finding a 



place to squat between the bucket 
seats. Bill threw the switch and 
Fisk’s controb went dead. Now he 
could relax. These regular racing 
drivers were almost as tough as 
their cars. 

“What’s next?” Bill demanded, 
angling the car gently around 
another dune. 

“Tunnel,” Yola said, wrestling 
with the map. 

“Fusion six hundred and 
seven . .” 

F isk lay back and let himself 
slide into whatever oblivion 
awaited. The demon had left him, 
but Fisk-normal still needed his 
medicine. Jhe race’s end could not 
be far off and it did look as though 
he were planning to survive. 

“Fusion seven-twenty-six . .” 

Bill shook his head. “Fisk, I 
don’t know exactly how you did 
it — but you’ve just made us rich. 
Those sales are going to hit a thou- 
sand. It’s a bandwagon now — 
everybody in the world will want a 
Fusion. We’ll get a quarter million 
dollars in commissions — ” 

“They’ll come to their senses and 
begin canceling after the excitement 
passes,” Fisk pointed out. Now 
that he could afford to fainty he 
seemed perversely to be recovering 
strength. 

“Sure — but the cancellations will 
be made up by other buyers reading

about this in the fax. That always 
happens. Don’t worry — we’ve got 
record wfnnings and the credit’s 
yours. So you took her through 
mach, did you? 1 never had the 
nerve.” 

“Terrific!” Yola cried, liking the 
idea of fame. 

• “Uh — better not,” Fisk said, 
eying the tiny mouth of the ap- 
proaching tunnel. Bill sounded 
normal, but Fisk didn’t trust the 
man’s condition. He had been un- 
conscious for a fair period and must 
have lost a significant quantity of 
blood — and an error in judgment of 
so much as six inches could be fatal, 
in that tight passage ahead. 

' “No, no, Fisk — you did it and 
you’ll get the commission. When I 
tell the boss how you pulled it 
out — ” 

“We’ll be rich!” Yola exclaimed 
with childish avarice. 

Fisk hadn’t been talking about 
money. His concern had been to see 
them through the tunnel alive. 
Steamco had just entered and at the 
rate the Fusion was going there 
would be contact between them in- 
side that darkness. Was Bill in- 
tending to vie for position even 
now? 

But it seemed money was a 
factor, because of the tremendous 
sales spurred by bis mad exploit of 
moments ago. Yola’s gre^ and 
Bill’s misunderstanding sent a 



negative ripple through the weary 
convolutions of his brain. “When 
you tell your boss that he’ll fire you 
for allowing an unqualified driver 
to take over and play roulette with 
ina^inery and people’s lives in the 
Hurdle. BecaUM you knew about 
me and he didn’t. It was blind luck 
that got us through — as the tapes of 
the race will show.” 

Bill slid the car into the Tunnel as 
though he had done it aQ his life— 
as perhaps he had. “Maybe so,” he 
said soberly. “But luck doesn’t 
usually operate that way — not on 
the El or the Mountain — and espe- 
cially not in getting up speed to 
hurdle wreckage. There was driving 
genius in your hands and feet, like it 
or not. But you’re right — it’s bad 
business and my boss would rather 
not know. Okay — we’ll split the 
take, half and half. It’s right to 
share, because I got hurt and 
you — ” 



AS THE Tunnel closed about 
them the rag-and-strap plug 
popped out of the bole in. the bub- 
ble, urged by the suddenly 
compressing air within the con- 
fined space. An almost solid 
blast of atmosphere rammed in, 
striking Bill in the face and making 
a stormlike turbulence within the 
bubble. The car swerved, partly be- 
cause Bill'^ould barely see in the 



142 



IF 




gale, but mostly, Fisk knew, be- 
cause of the drag of the aperture it- 
self. There was no room to com- 
pensate here. The stony walls were 
inches away. 

But Yola knew what to do and 
since no one had told her to do it, 
she did it. She crawled across Bill’s 
lap, probably kneeing him painfully 
in the process, fetched in the tat- 
tered wad and jamfhed it back into 
the hole. The storm subsided. 

Fisk was able to speak again. 
“You were hurt because my 
daughter ran out in front of us 
while you were going through 
Hairpin. She almost killed us all.” 

“Take the money — take the 
money!” Yola cried. 

“You sure are one for making ob- 
jections,” Bill said ruefully. “What 
do you want?” 

“1 think we’d better just walk out 
of your life when the race is over. A 
good — ” 

He had to pause, for they had 
caught up with Steamco. The Tun- 
nel was lighted, but irregularly — 
the width varied from one to three 
lanes with curves thrown in. Pass- 
ing could be tricky — and Steamco 
had no intention of being passed. 

“A good sales day is the least we 
can do to repay — ” 

But Fisk had 'to stop again as Bill 
swerved to pass on a subterranean 
straightaway and was quickly 
Mocked off. Steamco had to know 



that there was no car to beat but 
Fusion — all the drivers would have 
been hearing the radio reports. The 
only way Steamco could recoup 
was by finishing ahead — or by put- 
ting Fusion out of the race entirely. 

The passage narrowed, halting 
the maneuvering for the moment. 

“ — the trouble we have caused 
you,” Fisk continued. “I’ll find 
another job.” 

“Fisk, shut up,” Yola said. 
“You’re throwing away a quarter 
million dollars.” 

“Fusion nine hundred and eighty- 
one sales . .” 

“Look, Fisk,” Bill said earnestly 
as the dark walls rushed past and 
trickles of wind whined in through 
the stuffed hole. “I told you I’d 
cover for you about yotir lack of ex- 
perience, laughable as that seems 
now. You’ve had experience 
somewhere — somehow — even if 

you don’t remember it. You’re 
covering for me, really. And I’d 
never make trouble for your little 
girl. You don’t have to sign over the 
money for that. I want you to have 
your share because you earned it. I 
wouldn’t feel right letting you go 
away with nothing after the way 
you—” 

“1 wouldn’t feel right taking it,” 
Fisk said firmly. “You were right — 
any idiot can drive this car and one 
just did — ” 

“Fisk,” Yola said, “if you don’t

take that money. I’m going to — ” 

The dark track opened into a 
dual lane, then into a broad cavern 
spiked with stalagmites casting 
multiple and deceptive shadows. 
Many trails seemed to be open. Bill 
goosed the Fusion and angled for 
the far right opening. The Steamco 
moved over to block him, staying 
just ahead so that passing was 
impossible. 

“I’ll take the commission myself 
and make out a check for you,’’ Bill 
said, as though nothing special were 
going on. “I’ll take all the credit for 
the race, if that’s the way you want 
it — but you’ve got to have your 
share of the commission. I can’t 
take all the money for a race I 
didn’t drive.’’ 

“I don’t want it,’* Fisk said. 

Bill tried to pass again. The ma- 
neuver was impressive at 400 mph 
in the partially lighted cavern. But 
Steamco was ready and stayed 
ahead. 

“Fusion one thousand and thirty- 
eight. .’’ 

“I’ll give H to your daughter, 
then,’’ Bill said. “An irrevocable 
trust for her education, so she 
doesn’t have to run onto any more 
'racetracks.’’ 

“Yeah, yeah!’’ Yola agreed, but 
with less enthusiasm. 

Fisk shook . his head. “That 
money should go to your injured 
partner.” 



Another dangerous dodge that 
nearly put both cars into a post. 
“Twenty-five per cent to your little 
girl, then.” Bill looked grim. “A 
hundred grand will cover my 
friend’s bill. You’re making me set- 
tle for twice that. I don’t like profi- 
teering on something like this. I’m 
hurting in my conscience worse 
than on my head and I can’t dicker 
with you any more. That’s my final 
offer.” 

“Flip for it,” Yola said. “You go 
left next split — last moment. If 
Steamco goes right, you pass and 
Fisk takes the share.” 

“Okay.” 

Fisk was about to demur again, 
when the radio interrupted: “Folks, 
you’ll be glad to know the drivers 
survived Duperjet’s crash. They 
blame themselves for misjudg- 
ment — too much speed in the 
Slalom . .” 

Fisk felt a tremendous relief. 

Bill accelerated again, almost 
touching Steamco’s persistent tail. 
As the post zoomed in on them, the 
first of a line of them, he nudged 
right, then cut sharply left. 
Steamco was caught on the right 
side, too late to compensate 
without cracking into the pylon. 

UVJTHAT’S the matter wHh 
W you?” Yola demanded as 
she and Fisk stepped out of the 
tube at his apartment building.

“We need money and you know it. 
Why wouldn’t you take your share?” 

Fisk himself hardly understood 
his reasons. ”What I did wasn’t 
real. Some demon in me wanted the 
glory of winning the Hurdle, no 
matter what the cost. I was too sick 
to control it — ” 

“That’s right. You looked like a 
corpse. 1 thought sure you meant to 
kill us.” 

“But once the pressure was off 1 
regained control. By then it was too 
late to undo the damage — ” 

“But you’re the one who brought 
off the win.” 

“The demon brought if off. But 
at least 1 ^dn’t have to give that 
demon the satisfaction of making a 
profit from the episode. With no 
credit and no money — ” 

“Except that trust Bill’s setting 
up for me that nobody can touch,” 
she said. “Fisk, that money would 
have bought a lot of fun for both of 
us and now all it’s good for is edu- 
cation. Ugh!” 

“Precisely. Education abolishes 
demons.’’ 

“1 just don’t get it,” she said 
crossly* 

“Neither do 1,” Fisk admitted. 
“I just knew that neither the racing 
credit nor the money was rightfully 
mine. 

“I will earn my fortune in my 
own way or not at all. That’s my 
particular hurdle. Maybe it’s a 



question of whether Dr. Jekyll or 
Mr. Hyde will govern.” ~ 

“Who?” 

He sighed. “Never mind. It’s a 
devious point of characterization — 
and perhaps illusory. But disaster 
strikes every time I compromise my 
principles. I tried to make an illicit 
profit in Marsland speculation and 
lost everything. 1 got involved in 
black market adoption and almost 
landed in jail. This time I very 
nearly killed us all. The demon of- 
fers material riches, but his real 
goal is misery.” 

She uttered the expletive he still 
didn’t understand. “The first time 
you got a new, exciting life. The 
second time you got me. This time 
you could have had — ” 

“At any rate — I’ll never go near 
another racing car as long as I — ” 

“Hey, what’s this?” she cried, 
lifting something out of the 
package slot of the apartment 
door.” 

Fisk -looked at what she had 
found. It was a small square item 
with a gift tag. 

Yola read it aloud. “‘You’re a 
great sport. Sink Bill.’ ” 

“That’s ‘Sine.,’ not ‘sink,’ ” Fisk 
said. “For ‘Sincerely.’ ” But she 
was already tearing open the wrap- 
ping with juvenile impatience. 

Inside was the personalized ID 
ownership key for a new Fusion 
Special. •

THE 

EXECUTIVE RAT 




146 




W HEN Dr. Fahy came into 
my office I was genuinely 
pleased to see him. His reputation 
in behavioral studies was interna- 
tional and I had been secretly hop- 
ing that he would ask me to design 
instrumentation to carry out his 
new series of experiments. Doctor 
Fahy was in his early sixties, a tall 
thin man with a rather dour expres- 
sion. He spoke with a minimum of 
words and the only time he smiled 
was when he learned that his grant 
would not be charged for my 
engineering time. 

“As a recent arrival at the uni- 
versity,” he said, “I’m quite 
overwhelmed by the many free 
services.” 

“The parts and construction time 
are charged,” I pointed out. 
“Naturally,” said Dr. Fahy. 

His pale blue eyes wandered 
about my office and fixed upon the 
double row of filing cabinets. 

“You have a kind of executive 
responsibility, haven’t you?” 

I nodded. 

“I’m the sole engineer of the 
electronics laboratory but I do 
have two technicians working for 
me. With all due modesty, let me 
point out that I’ve designed every- 
thing from a simple stimulator for 
monkey testicles, to special pur- 
pose minicomputers.” 

Dr. Fahy did not seem overly im- 
pressed. 



“That’s fine,” he said dryly. 
“Then you should have no diffi- 
culty meeting my needs. I’ve typed 
out a set of specifications which I 
will leave in your care. Within a 
week’s time, I should like a cost 
estimate and a projected date of 
delivery.” 

I accepted the three pages of 
specifications with some disap- 
pointment. He seemed to sense my 
distress. 

“Is anything wrong?” he asked. 

I sighed. 

“The standard working practice 
here is for the researcher to outline 
for me what he intends to do. I 
have some familiarity with the 
ongoing research. Knowing exactly 
what is supposed to happen enables 
me to design a better and more apt 
instrument.” 

He nodded. 

“That certainly sounds reason- 
able,” said Dr. Fahy. “Neverthe- 
less, I don’t work that way. You 
build me what I’ve asked for and 
I’ll assume all responsibility for the 
end result.” 

I was annoyed at his brusqueness 
but I concealed my anger. 

“As you wish,” I said. 

I T WAS clear from a study of the 
specifications that Doctor Fahy 
wanted an animal shocker of extra- 
ordinary potential. He was asking 



THE EXECUTIVE RAT 



147 




for a ten-thousand volt source 
capable of delivering up to ten 
milliamperes of current. Once 
chosen, the current setting was to 
remain stable to within a tiny 
fraction of a per cent despite wide 
variations in the resistance of what- 
ever it was he intended to shock. An 
accurate printout of the value of 
the shocking current was required 
as well as a complex logic facility 
to program the sequencing and 
timing of the shocks. There were to 
be remote and local controls. But 
most disconcerting were the extra- 
ordinary tolerances that were 
asked for. Clearly this design would 
require utterly new techniques. 

I was still quite annoyed at Dr. 
Fahy’s reticencfe. If he had told me 
what he intended to do I might 
have been able to point out whero 
some of the specifications might be 
relaxed. 

I decided to go first to the 
library and read up on his past 
experiments. I had no difficulty in 
locating his work. The experi- 
mental journals of psychology 
were filled with them. Generally 
his procedure was to shock ex- 
perimental rats in the region of the 
tail and at the same time submit 
them to trying sets of circum- 
stances. In his '"executive rat’\ 
experiment, he found that animals 
who could not turn off the shock 
source right after it had been turned 



on, developed a severe kind of 
stomach ulcer. 

In some cases, he would warn 
the rat by a tone that the shock 
was about to come. In other cases, 
he provided them with a series of 
tones which terminated just before 
the shock began. But in every case, 
he gave the animals tasks to per- 
form despite the approaching 
shocks. 

My greatest disappointment 
came in discovering that nowhere 
did he describe his experimental 
apparatus, save in general terms. 
He did not specify the accuracies 
of his readings and his results were 
summarized only in statistical 
terms. I went back to my office and 
set about a preliminary design to 
meet the specifications. When I 
had finished I called in Dr. Fahy 
and showed him the results. He 
became quite angry. 

"Four thousand dollars to 
build?" he cried. "That’s out- 
rageous!" 

I attempted to soothe his anger. 

"If only you would relax your 
specifications," I began. 

"He snorted. "Nonsense.This 
apparatus is virtually the same as 
the one I had at Bradman Tech. 
The engineer there had no diffi- 
culty in building it for half the 
amount. I don’t like to question 
your competence, but perhaps 
you’d like me to get his design?" 



148 



IF 




“There’s no need for that,’’ I 
snapped. “I don’t need someone 
else’s design. But the cost of the 
parts and labor cannot be reduced.’’ 

He shrugged. 

“If I must, I must,’’ he said. 
“When can I have it?’’ '' 

“It will take about a month to 
get the parts and a month to build 
the entire unit. Then a week or two 
to check it out. However, there are 
other people ahead of you.’’ 

He waved his hands impatiently. 

“I can’t wait my turn,” said Dr, 
Fahy. “If you want a letter from 
the university president authoriz- 
ing you to give me priority I’ll get 
it for you. I have a new grant 
proposal to write in five months. 1 
must have fresh data long before 
then.” 

At that point I made my first 
great error. 

“I’ll give you first priority,” I 
said. 



B y virtue of nights and 
Saturdays of unstinting work 
I managed to deliver this very 
complex system within two months’ 
time. He accepted it matter-of- 
factly and without even perfunctory 
thanks. After two days of trial. Dr. 
Fahy called me on the phone and 
indicated that except for minor 
bugs everything seemed in order. 

He then dropped his bombshell. 



“I shall require four copies of the 
prototype system,” he said. “And 
I must have them as soon as possi- 
ble. I have four technicians 
drawing salary here and they’ll 
have nothing to do until you 
supply me with these additional 
units.” 

“We’re not set up for produc- 
tion,” I said. “Wc do have other 
jobs to do.” 

“That’s not my concern,’^ he 
said. “If you require authorization 
for additional technicians I’ll 
get it for you.” 

Two days later the authorization 
to hire two additional technicians 
came through from the university 
president’s office. But there was no 
provision for additional bench 
space. Thereafter I spent two 
frustrating weeks interviewing job 
prospects before I found two men_ 
who seemed even marginally to 
meet the job requirements. 

^I asked Dr. Fahy, in the interests 
of speedy output, to let me borrow 
the prototype for use as a model 
but he refused. 

“The unit is in constant use and 
can’t be spared,” he said. 

I had to work very closely with 
my new technicians and provide 
them with detailed mechanical 
drawings of each section, particu- 
larly demonstrating the way all 
parts had to be mounted. Weeks 
went by with Dr. Fahy constantly 



THE EXECUTIVE RAT

calling me and complaining about 
the delay. I Was in the process of 
checking out unit Number Two, 
when Dr. Fahy called again. 

“Unit One just quit in the middle 
of an experiment. Can you come 
right over?” 

I went. The power light on the 
panel of the controller was off. 1 
checked the fuse — it was okay. 
After an hour of fussing around I 
disconnected the controller and 
took it back to my laboratory. 
Two hours later I found a poorly 
soldered connection. When it had 
been resoldered, I returned the 
controller. Dr. Fahy set his dials for 
a test run. His panel lights in- 
dicated an incorrect sequence of 
shocks. 

“It’s been acting up this way 
lately,” said Dr. Fahy. 

I was astonished. 

“I .wish you’d told me before. 
That should never happen.” 

He was annoyed when I insisted 
on taking the controller back once 
again. This time it took a day of 
probing to find that one of my 
integrated circuit chips was failing 
on an intermittent basis. I replaced 
the chip and to my shocked sur- 
prise, there was no improvement. 

Dr. Fahy came by at this time. 

“My experiments are stopped 
cold,” he said. “Why don’t you 
let me try Unit Two?” 

“You can,” I said reluctantly. 



•4f 

“But I haven’t really completed 
all my checkout tests.” 

“I’ll take my chances,” he said. 

T he third unit came to my 
bench a week later but I still 
hadn’t found the trouble with 
Unit One. And then 1 discovered 
a diode had been wired in back- 
ward. I was both elated and 
annoyed. 

“I’ll be damned,” I cried. “How 
the hell did this unit ever work?” 

I delivered it to Dr. Fahy 
the following day. 'He seemed 
relieved. 

“The printouts of this second unit 
are unreliable,” he said. 

I took Unit Two back. 

Unit Four was ready when I 
finally repaired Unit Two and 
then I discovered Unit One back 
on my bench with a note from Dr. 
Fahy stating that it had become 
unreliable again. The symptoms 
of Unit One were the most 
baffling I had ever encountered. It 
would function perfectly on my 
bench and then misbehave in Dr. 
Fahy’s lab. 

“Are your assistants reporting 
the symptoms correctly?” I asked. 

“My assistants do not touch any 
of the controls. I am the only one to 
do so,” he said. 

I shook my head in ^puzzlement 
as he added a few biting sarcasms. 



150 



IF 




I had taken to waking in the middle 
of the night with hunger pains 
that were allayed only by lots of 
milk and cookies. Sometimes they 
even occurred between meals 
during the day and I began to 
keep snacks on hand in my 
laboratory. My weight began to 
go up, despite the fact that I had 
begun to come in on Suhdays in an 
attempt to catch up on my backlog. 

Dr. Fahy saw me nibbling cook- 
ies and sipping milk one day. 

“It’s not a good idea to cram in 
so many sweets,” he said. 

1 was flattered by his interest. It 
was the first time he had seemed 
to take personal note of my 
habits. I told him of my continual 
hunger. He became alive with 
attention. 

‘/When did it start,” he asked. 
“How frequently, do yon get 
these hunger pains?” 

I told him. 

“Have you had a physical 
recently?” 

“About six months ago,” I 
said. “Everything was perfect.” 

“If I’m right,” he said, “you’ve 
got a peptic ulcer.” v 

He insisted on taking a full his- 
tory of my symptoms before send- 
ing me off to the specialist 
associated with the university who 
confirmed the diagnosis. He put 
me on a diet of milk and antacids. 

“Are you under particular 



stresses?” he asked sympathetically. 
“For the time being, yes.” 

“They won’t help your ulcer. 
You need a long rest from your 
work.” 

I sighed. 

“I don’t see how.” 



B ut a small amount of relief 
appeared on the horizon. The 
annual engineering show had come 
to town and despite my work load, 
I decided to attend. With a great 
deal of guilt, I went to a talk given 
by a man named Holcomb, an 
engineer from Bradman Tech, Dr. 
Fahy’s former Bailiwick. After- 
ward I went up to chat with 
Holcomb. 

“Did you know Dr. Fahy?” I 
asked. 

He smiled. 

“Very well,” he said. ‘‘He’s a 
difficult man to please. Fortunately 
I never did any instrumentation for 
him.” 

“Who did?” I asked. 

He seemed puzzled. 

“Did what?” 

“Built his previous instrumenta- 
tion at Bradman Tech.” I told him 
of the troubles I had run into. He 
shook his head. 

“Beats the hell out of me,” he 
said. “I never built anything for 
Fahy. He’s a trained engineer. He 
got his bachelor’s degree in elec- 



THE EXECUTIVE RAT 



151 




Ironies before he got his doctorate 
in psychology.” 

“TTien you have no idea who de- 
signed and built his shockers?” 

“He probably made them him- 
self,” said Holcomb. “At the 
time I was annoyed because he 
didn’t use me.” 

“I wish I had been that lucky,” 
I said. 

But now I began to wonder what 
was going on. That night I went 
back to my office and pondered 
the situation. Dr. Fahy had been 
quite clear in asserting that his 
equipment had been designed for 
him at Bradman Tech. He had 
been lying to me. 

I walked over to his laboratory 
in the Hanley- Building. It was 
after nine in the evening and the 
doors were locked. I used my 
duplicate keys and went inside 
the deserted , rooms. All of the 
equipment, including three of my 
malfunctioning programers, had 
been turned off. I meticulously 
checked his interconnecting cables 
and found three sets running off 
somewhere. I followed them and 
found that they ran to a remote 
room where presumably Dr. Fahy 
could operate electronic gear in- 
cluding a programable patch board. 

I had nev^r seen any of this 
equipment before. 

I turned it on and checked the 
function of all the controls. 1 then 



went back into the main laboratory 
and turned on the equipment I had 
designed. It was almost one in the 
morning before I finished my 
investigation. 

I slept poorly that night and 
spent quite a bit of time at the 
refrigerator, allaying my hunger 
pains. In the morning I went to sec 
Dr. Fahy. He seemed annoyed at 
the interruption. 

“I must talk to you,” I said. “I 
believe I’ve found the source of our 
electronic instability.” 

He smiled. 

“Have you really?” 

“It’s in your remote logic 
control system,’’ I said. “The one 
that you designed and patched into 
my units.” 

He nodded. 

“I suppose you want an explana- 
tion,” he said. 

“To put it mildly.” 

“I’ve always worked with rats,” 
said Dr. Fahy. “Generally speak- 
ing, they develop ulcers for two 
reasons. One is the situation where 
they are given shocks unless they 
solve an unsolvabic problem. The 
other involves solving an infinite 
number of solvable problems.” 

“It seems I got an infinite 
number of insolvablc problems,” I 
said. 

“That was nasty, wasn’t it,” said 
Dr. Fahy. “But you sec, working 
with rats is one thing. Extrapolat- 



152 



IF 




ing to humans is quite another/" 
‘*So you chose me. And I did 
develop the expected gastric ulcer.” 
“You’re angry and I don’t blame 
you,” said Fahy. “But there was a 
scientific problem of the greatest 
moment at stake. I became 
obsessed with knowing the answer. 
Can you understand that?” 

“How do you think the faculty 
council will react when I report 
what you’ve done?” 

“You won’t do that,” said Dr. 
Fahy. “For one thing, you can’t 
prove your case. I’ll deny every- 
thing.” 

“Even this conversation?” 

“Even that. But you have an 
alternative choice. If you agree 
to sign a waiver of claims against 
me. I’ll publish our data. It will 
rock the scientific world and give 
you immortality.” 

“No doubt,” I said dryly. “But 
who would publish this caricature 
of science?” 

“I’m editor of a psychology 
journal. I’ll put itlhrough myself. 
There will be a storm afterward 
but I’ll take my chances with that. 
It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experi- 
ment that has never been done 
before.” 

“You could have gotten volun- 
teers.” 

“Could I? If the subject 
had prior knowledge, it would 
have vitiated all the results. 



wouldn’t it?” Fahy was gloating. 
“I’ll think it over,” 1 said. 

I WAS sitting in my office, a 
week later, when the terrible 
news broke. There had been a 
dreadful accident in the Fahy 
laboratory. One of the shockers 
had failed to operate. Dr. Fahy 
had opened the cage that should 
have turned off the high voltage 
through a^n interlock. In some inex- 
plicable way he had received a ten- 
thousand-volt jolt across the chest. 
After intensive first-aid he had 
finally come around. 

As I arrived, he was being 
carried out of the laboratory on a 
stretcher. One of his young as- 
sistants was in tears. 

“How is he?” I asked her. 

“He’ll live — but he’s a very sick 
man,” she said. 

After she had gone, 1 examined 
the cage where the accident had 
occured. I turned off the power at 
the main panel and went directly to 
the interlock. It took but a few 
seconds to remove the override 
wire I had inserted the night before 
and restore the interlock circuit to 
its normal state. Then I set off to 
my office to write a report about 
the mechanical failure of the inter- 
lock to the shocker. 

That night, for the first time in 
many months, I slept through 
without a single hunger pain. •

I ’M TOLD that a good reviewer 
is a monstrously clever man who 
doesn’t like anything and whose job 
is to delight his readers by sharing 
his cynicism with them, while 
disliking them beyond all else. The 
above may ap^)ly to many fields of 
reviewing, but I’ve never believed it 
applied to reviews of science-fiction 
books. I feel it more important to 
cover the books that should be read 
than to warn people from the bad 
ones — and I’m always delighted 
when I have a list of good works. It 
may not give me as many chances 
to show off my own brilliance, but 
it serves the readers. 

Dealing with books I like 
presents problems, of course. For 
one thing. I’m farther out on a thin- 
ner limb — enumerating the ways in 
which a novel can fail is not dif- 
ficult and involves hardly any risk

at all. But the lack of these faults 
does not necessarily make a good 
book. Even technical writing" ex- 
cellence can do no more than make 
a barely acceptable one. Some of 
the newer writers show more 
technical excellence than we’ve had 
in the field before, yet I find their 
adaptations of the avant-garde 
themes from Story magazine of the 
early thirties boring, no matter how 
well done. 

The elements in a story that 
usually please me most ^em to lie 
in the writer himself. He must have 
a wide range of interests and enthu- 
siasms. These should include a 
liking for and knowledge of the 
scientific aspects of our civilization 
^ as ' well as human and cultural 
developments. He must enjoy 
playing with a variety of future 
possibilities. He must have a real 
and varied interest in science fiction 
for itself. And he must enjoy 
writing and watching his plots and 
characters develop, just as he would 
enjoy seeing another writer’s story 
develop while reading it. It isn’t 
enough to like being a writer or 
winning approval from a clique — he 
must find enough pleasure in writing 
science fiction to put every bit of 
himself into it for his own approval. 
If you can get all that together 
you’ve got an author of merit. 

I think we’ve been lucky enough 
to add such a writer to the field 



recently. David Gerrold has had 
four novels published within the last^ 
year or less, the first being a 
collaboration with Larry Niven 
which had serious faults, but also 
many strong virtues. {The Flying 
Sorcerers, previously reported 
here.) The others are solo flights and 
they look very promising in sum. 

His Space Skimmer (Ballantine, 
95^) is apparently the first of a 
series, from what I’ve been told. In- 
cidentally, the gadget on the cover 
looks like some artist’s attempt at 
symbolism but is actually a very 
good depiction of the ship in the 
story — ^something of an ultimate 
dream of spaceships, around which 
the plot develops. A thousand years 
before the story begins, the Empire 
of the Galaxy had extended itself 
beyond its ability to communicate 
and was falling to pieces. The skim- 
mers were created to solve the prob- 
lems, but they went out and were 
never heard from again. The Em- 
pire fell and each component of it 
evolved its own culture and life 
style or form. As the story develops 
a barbarian who must flee his mis- 
erable world discovers a skimmer 
and takes off in it. But he under- 
stands its operation so poorly that 
he has to seek assistahee. Each new 
addition to the crew provides new 
problems, and each introduces new 
cultures and more mysteries about 
the problems that wrecked the Em-

pire. The plot is a little thin — 
probably because this story basi- 
cally sets up the situation for others 
to come. But the characters are 
good — their interrelationships pro- 
vide interest and tension and the 
ship grows to be a major character 
in the story. I for one will be 
interested in seeing more of the ad- 
ventures. The book gets a qualified 
recommendation as the beginning 
of what may be an excellent series. 

G ERROLD’S novel Yesterday s 
’ Children (Dell, 95i ) has 
nothing to do with wonderchildren. 
The characters are adults, but true 
children of the impersonal nature of 
war's evolution into the future. All 
the action takes place aboard a 
long-put-of-date destroyer, manned 
by people assigned to the ship be- 
cause of their failure to merit better 
positions. Its Captain, Brandt, is a 
man who has given up responsi- 
bility. First Officer Korie is either a 
madman with an obsession to fight 
or a genius at doing the impossible. 
The two officers are totally opposed 
and the crew is caught in the mid- 
dle. The story begins in the course 
of a chase after an enemy ship — it 
ends Vith the resolution of the 
chase. And the enemy (the “bogie”) 
throughout is only a light on the 
screens — and the war is simply a 
development of centuries of war. 
The characterization and conflict 



of characters are excellent. The 
tension mounts steadily as the 
characters evolve. The technical 
details of the ship and its method of 
extralight travel are developed fully 
and credibly. (There’s no reason for 
the awkward present-tense style, 
but it ceases to bother after a 
while). 

The only real flaw is unfortu- 
nately major. The ending, while 
well prepared, is not an adequate 
resolution. 

The whole story has centered on 
the character of Korie. The ending 
seems to push the resolution of that 
character aside, as if the reader 
were not involved with him. (And 
nothing could be less true.) If the 
rest of the novel hadn’t been ex- 
cellent, this might have been ac- 
ceptable. As it is, Gerrold has writ- 
ten a damned good book that be- 
comes unsatisfactory only in the 
last two or three pages. 

It does, however, prove the 
ability of Gerrold to handle back- 
grounds, character, technical 
details and almost every aspect of 
the science-fiction novel with 
passion and with marvelous inven- 
tiveness. 

I T IS in his When Harlie Was 
One (Ballantine, $1.25) that 
Gerrold proves what a fine science- 
fiction writer he can be. This is a 
first-rate novel. Much of it was 



156 



IF 




published in stories appearing in 
Galaxy Magazine, but this book is 
not a collection of novelettes— Ger- 
rold has written this version as a 
true, continuous novel, with a con- 
siderable development. 

The story centers on a computer, 
Harlie, who was designed to be as 
human as possible. He’s one year 
old when the story opens. He is 
under the tutelage of a psycho- 
logist, David Auberson. And he’s in 
danger, because the company that 
built him is under new management 
and determined to scrap him if he 
can’t prove he is financially 
valuable. Harlie faces immininent 
death. What does he do? He is an 
adult in intelligence, but immature. 
So he overloads his inputs by feed- 
back and goes on a “trip.” He 
writes kooky verse. And he gets on 
a binge of discussions about the 
nature of God and of human love, 
etc. When pressed for proof of his 
value he comes up with a demand 
for more funds to build a G.O.D. 
machine to make him omniscient. 
By now there’s a question of his 
sanity as well of his value — and 
even his father-figure psychologist 
can’t be sure of the answer. 

The characters and their evolu- 
tion in the story could not have 
been better handled. Harlie ad- 
vances from precocious imma- 
turity to a true person — one both 
fully human and fully robotic. 



Gradually we see and believe as he 
transfers to being the consulting 
psychologist for Auberson in his 
troubles with the love affair that is 
the sub-plot of the novel. The long 
discussions on religion and love are 
done so well and with such a lack of 
the obvious or banal that they are 
as interesting as any plot develop- 
ment — and so integrated that they 
are plot development. The technical 
background of Harlie is handled 
convincingly and with an inventive- 
ness that makes it a major part of 
the problem and resolution. And 
the ending of the story isn’t a 
simple solution to the immediate 
problem, but an extension and 
deepening of all that has gone be- 
fore. It’s a clever book — and a 
darned good one. 

The novel is being issued in 
hardcover as a Science Fiction 
Book Club selection. Let me 
recommend that every member 
choose it. It’s one of the best novels 
of the year.

man who has come to a realization

developing. This book bears no 
direct relation to Dickson's famous 
Dorsai series, but the connection 
must be made by the reader, 
nevertheless. The novel takes place 
at an early stage of Earth’s coloni- 
zation of the stars. The problem is 
to make the colony worlds self-sup- 
porting and then to somehow resist 
the encroachment of - aliens — 
closely related problems. Added to 
all is the fact that Earth has let it- 
self become a mess and now must 
ship out much of its population — 
but it can’t afford to support or de- 
fend its outcasts. 

I didn’t find this novel quite as 
good as the best of the Dorsai series, 
but that may be due to the fact that 
—as a professional writer who gets 
involved in the method of other 
writers — I am becoming too famil- 
air with the way Dickson handles 
this type of idea. Nevertheless, 
Dickson’s deep interest in the way 
the past must affect the future and 
his always ingenious handling of 
the sociology of aliens combine to 
make it a very good novel. His 
exploration of the^ value of outcasts 
from one culture when exposed to 
a different one gives this novel 
something not to be found in 
similar degree in the Dorsai books. 
I recopimend it highly. 

F REDERIK POHL is another of 
our old masters and a 



surprising one in his collection. 
The Gold at the Starbows End 
(Ballantine, $1.25). The three short 
stories are excellent examples of the 
type of fiction we expect from him, 
one of which I was happy to be able 
to buy from him for Worlds of Fan- 
tasy. There are' also two very long' 
novelettes — and here is where the 
surprise comes in. Both were pub- 
lished in 1972, so they are quite 
recent. Both are good. And both 
represent Pohl as most readers do 
not expect him to be. 

Most of the readers of this 
magazine must have read The 
Merchants of Venus Underground. 
This is straight adventure fiction in 
its best form. It takes the modern 
beliefs in what Venus is like — which 
make fiction seem hopeless on a 
planet so inhospitable to life — and 
gives us a realistic colony struggling 
at the edge of failure. Pohl then 
puts forward as hero the type of 
man who might survive there and 
builds a convincing story out of the 
conflicting interests of the hero and 
a tourist who hires him to explore 
the traces of a mysterious other 
race. Good from start to excellent 
finish. 

The Gold at the Starbow s End is 
a story I will not try to summarize. 
When I finished reading it, I called 
up Pohl to tell him it was the best 
novelette I’d read for several 
years— and I was completely

sincere. It should win a Hugo and a 
Nebula award — it deserves all 
honors. 

It’s a hard story to pin down, 
using some surprising extensions 
into the future from Pohl’s interest 
in such things as number theory and 
mental development. It’s very much 
Pohl at his best. And yet, somehow, 
the whole thing seems like a new 
and unexpected development in 
Pohl’s writing career. The story is 
basically in the grand tradition of 
romance and human supremacy 
from the good old days, yet it mixes 
its vision with the bitter truth from 
modern science fiction. The 
novelette seems to have taken the 
so-called new wave and old wave, 
combined the best of both and 
come up with something uniquely 
its own self. 

The collection is Pohl at his top 
form, better than his previous ones. 
I can’t recommend it too highly. 

A nother collection is a must,

than a generation ago. John W. 



Campbell’s Cloak of A'esir (Lancer, 
95^, is back in print after far too 
many years. (This was originally 
issued in a small hardcover edition

previously in softcover form.) 
Seven of the “Don A. Stuart’’ 
stories are here, including the two 
stories of Aesir and the matchless 
tale of the ultimate destiny of 
Man — Forgetfulness, It’s very good 
to have these stories available 
again — and good to know that a 
great deal more of Campbell’s fic- 
tion will soon be republished. 

In our field, anything from the 
early ’thirties seems almost prehis- 
toric. While most of the Don A. 
Stuart fiction will stand the test of 
so much time, very few other stories 
from that distant past will endure 
so well. We’ve learned a great deal 
in forty years and we’ve constantly 
redefined science fiction as it has 
evolved.

avocation, or hobby. He was a dis- 
tinguished mathematician, but his 
fiction dealt more with the emo- 
tional impact of science and the fu- 
ture than with science for itself. 
And for years one of his novels has 
been considered a classic. I read 
The Time Stream (currently avail- 
able from Dover Publications at 
$1.75) out of order and over a per- 
iod of years as I could find the old 
magazines from 1931 and 1932. 
I could recognize its merits 
but was left with some loose ends — 
natural under the conditions of my 
reading. Now I’ve had a chance to 
read the story in one sitting. 

I know now why it was con- 
sidered a classic. It was a pioneer- 
ing work dealing with variable time 
(though this is still confusing)— and 
the emotional quality deriving from 
its sweeping concept was new and 
fresh when it was first published. 
The book deals with a nearly per- 
fect society in the future (or past, 
since time here is circular) and 
present-day men who dip into the 
time stream to be swept into that 
society. But men of that “future” 
are also dipping into the time 
stream and going to the far past, 
tracing their own doom and the 
cyclic doom of all societies be- 
tween. And, unfortunately, in Eos, 
which is the Eden of the future, 
there are the snake and the apple. 

The book still is not entirely clear 



and much of its luster seems to have 
faded with time and changing quali- 
ties of writing. There are no real 
characters and the motivations 
are often cloudy and unreal. Yet 
there is a fascination to The Time 
Stream. I think the volume is well 
worth the price, particularly since 
Dover has done its usual splendid 
job of printing and binding and has 
also included four of the original 
Frank R. Paul illustrations, very 
well reproduced. 

Dover Publications (180 Varick 
Street, New York, N.Y. 10014) 
offer a large selection of science- 
fiction and adventure classics that 
are always good buys. I would 
recommend that any serious reader 
write for their free list. Most book- 
stores carry only a few. 

Incidentally, Dover also sells a 
series of “Teach Yourself’ Books. 
I’ve seen two of these, both priced 
at $2.50: Cybernetics, by F. H. 
George; and Electronics, by W. P. 
Jolly. I have no intention of review- 
ing self-help books, but these are 
too good to pass up. They won’t 
make a professional scientist out of 
anyone, but they will give the sim- 
plest and most accurate introduc- 
tion to an understanding of their 
subjects I’ve seen. They also have 
lucid, modern diagrams — some- 
thing sadly lacking in many books 
— and are worth more than the 
price asked for them. •

T he laboratory was roomy and 
equipped to the ceiling and I 
hated every antiseptic inch of it, 
especially the inches comprising the 
cage. I was in the cage and the only 
thing I had with me was a boot. It 
should have been a gun because 
that was what I had made a grab 
for after my hasty rush through the 
water toward the beach a short 
time ago. 

“Hey, dumdum,” I called. The 
cage had no bars — it was simply 
a big box with walls made of strong 
metal screen. I banged on the 
screen by the door and called 
again. 

My kidnaper was about twenty 
feet away and as busy as could be 
with a batch of chemicals and test 
tubes. He was big, blond, naked, 
beautiful and one-hundred-per cent 
insane. Every time he looked at me 
he went blind. Each time I said 
something to him he went deaf. 
And that made no sense for he 
seemed to be able to see and hear 
normally otherwise. 

I gave the door a kick and he cast 
a glance my way and chuckled. 
Plainly he knew that he had 
something in the cage and his 
senses had been alert enough for 
him to snatch me off the beach and 
carry me here. That much I could 
understand. 

He must have had a brainstorm 
because he rushed out of the lab 



and came back a few minutes later 
with a handful of weeds. There was 
a four-inch space at the bottom of 
the cage and he shoved the weeds 
under it and grinned at me. Evi- 
dently I was supposed to have lunch 
now. 

I tried to kick the weeds at him 
but he turned too quickly and sped 
back to his test tubes. “Which 
culture?” he said and picked up a 
vial and examined it. What amazed 
me was that I understood every- 
thing he said. His speech was 
similar to ancient Chinese and I 
was a language expert. 

“Hey, dumdum,” I called. 
“Come and let me out. I*m no 
animal — I’m a girl. You know 
what a girl is.” 

He didn’t turn around, so busy 
was he preparing that culture. I 
slammed the screen with the flat 
of my hand and after a while he 
came over and looked in at me. 
For some reason he went blind 
again. Poking his nose against the 
mesh, he squinted and blinked. 

“I don’t understand how I could 
have missed something as big as 
you,” he said. “Where have you 
been hiding? I could have sworn 
there wasn’t another large animal 
for miles and piles.” 

I slammed the screen where his 
nose touched it and he' jumped 
back. “Let me out,” 1 yelled. 

He stood a short distance away

and squinted at me out of big sad 
eyes. *T11 do it painlessly. And Til 
try not to kill you, but I can’t 
promise anything.” 

H e went back to his putter- 
ing and I paced the cage for 
several minutes. I put on the boot 
and tried to kick a hole in the 
screen. It was then that I noticed 
the watch on my wrist. I wasn’t 
naked after all. Tying the piece 
of wire to the band, I dangled the 
watch outside the cage and swung 
it like a pendulum. All of a sudden 
the wire knot loosened and the 
watch fell on the floor about three 
yards away. 

Dumdum stepped on it when he 
came to visit me again. He said, 
“Ouch,” and picked off the watch 
that stuck to his sole. He held it a 
fraction of an inch away from his 
eyes, blinked at it a few times 
and then threw it away. He came 
on over to the cage and looked at 
me. His eyes grew bleary and I 
knew that this time it wasn’t only 
from blindness. He was feeling 
sorry because of what he was going 
to do to me. 

"'This thing in the cage isn’t a 
guinea pig,” I said. "You carried 
me from the lake, remember? I 
had two arms and legs, I was soft 
and cuddly and I stank. Damn you 
to hell, what’s wrong with you?” 



"I have a feeling,” he said. "This 
time it will work. You’re going to 
give it all back to me. I’ll have 
Radena again.” 

"I don’t know what that is but I 
hope it rots,” I said and, leaping 
to the sidescreen, I kicked at the 
same spot I had kicked before. 
The wire began to give. I waited 
until he went away and then I 
unwound wires around the weak 
spot in the screen and kicked like 
crazy. A hole began to appear and 
I kept kicking until it was big 
enough to crawl through* • 

Scrambling past the mad scien- 
tist, I got out of the building and 
ran around a corner and fell head- 
long into a cemetery. It took me 
a few seconds to realize what the 
place was. This was where he 
buried his guinea pigs after he 
murdered them. .He had made a 
stone for each one and there must 
have been hundreds of them in the 
long narrow rows. 

Behind me he said, ?You must 
have teeth like razors the way you 
bit through that screen.” 

"I’m not an animal,” I told him 
at the top of my lungs. "I’m too 
bright to be an animal. I know 
what this place is — it’s where you 
put what you^on’t need anymore. 
Here, I’ll show you.” Digging like 
a fiend, I made a hole in the 
ground after which I hauled off the 
boot and buried it.

“I see you’re a carnivore.” He 
kneeled and dug up the boot and 
gave it back to me. “You can’t 
hide your bone here. This is sacred 
ground.” 

He picked me up and took me to 
the cage and I sat in a corner and 
watched while he repaired the 
hole in the screen. 

“You’re a smart little beast,” he 
said. “You chose the weakest spot 
in this wall.” 

I didn’t want to savor the sight 
of him. But he was so damned 
beautiful. His back was big and 
smooth and I stared at it with a 
mixed kind of hunger. Then I saw 
something move on it and I stared 
more intently. All at once 1 re- 
coiled. 

Quietly crawling to the screen I 
looked at his back. The skin 
rippled. I began to move away from 
him. Beautiful he might be, but he 
was untouchable. He was wearing 
a festoon. 

Half a mile from this lab was 
a pretty little lake with a patch of 
trees bordering one side of it. 
Hidden in the trees was a fancy 
space cruiser that should have put 
down in the New York port on 
Earth twenty hours ago. Landing 
on an uninhabited planet for no 
other reason than to take a bath in 
a lake was something only an idiot 
or a spoiled brat would do. I’d been 
called spoiled plenty of times. My 



name was Raven Pek and my father 
had too much money. He bought 
me anything I wanted but he 
didn’t teach me how to be satisfied 
with myself. All I did was roam 
rround in my little ship, looking 
for something to do. 

My clothes were on the beach by 
the lake. The supposedly unin- 
habited planet had at least one 
person on it and that person had 
plucked me out of the water and 
made me his prisoner. 

As for the festoon — it was only a 
tale. A festoon was a parasite that 
lived somewhere in the Vigil 
Cluster. 

It was said to be immortal and it 
lived inside a host. It didn’t harm 
the wearer, in fact a symbiotic 
relationship was established that 
was beneficial to both. The festoon 
nourished itself on the host’s spare 
energy and the host enjoyed good 
health. 

The story was a myth and every- 
body knew it. I knew it. But my 
kidnaper was wearing something 
translucent, something that rippled 
like water and it couldn’t be a 
natural part of his body. Nor coiild 
it be a myth. 



M y brooding was interrupted 
when the cage door swung 
open and the mad chemist walked 
in to look down at me.

IF 




“No,” I yelled and tried to get 
away. 

He picked me up, carried me 
out and put me down on one of the 
slabs. Then he picked up a hypo- 
dermic. 

I don’t know what made me de- 
cide to pray. I used to like religion 
when I was little, but I hadn’t 
thought about God in years. Any- 
how, I rose to my knees, mad^ a 
steeple of my hands and began 
saying goodbye to everything. 
This man was mad and I doubted 
my chances of surviving after he 
injected me with his alien solution. 

I didn’t see his first reaction. I 
was certain that his vision cleared. 
Whatever it was that had been 
making him partially blind must 
have lost its control over him for a 
few moments. This was what I 
thought then. Later I realized his 
subconscious had forced him to see 
me before it was too late. But he 
did see me, not as an animal but 
as a human being. 

The hypo fell from his hand and 
shattered on the floor. I looked up 
and saw him standing there, his 
eyes filling with tears and his body 
stiffening in shock. “Oh, God,” he 
said softly and his hands rose to 
cover his eyes. 

All at once something weird 
happened. His hands dropped and 
his eyes looked different. They were 

clouded, as if a thin film had slid

over them. I saw myself fade from 
his vision and from his mind and it 
was as if I weren’t there. Like a 
smear on a window I had been 
wiped out of his existence'. In 
amazement 1 watched as he began 
looking around the lab with a 
puzzled expression,- watched as he 
finally gave a shrug and walked 
away. He went out of the building 
and I sat on the slab and tried to 
figure out what was going on. 
Eventually 1 followed him. 

H e was standing on a hill and 
I ran after him. He tramped 
through a large garden of vegeta- 
bles, walked down a path between 
two streams of water and came to a 
halt. From where I stood I could 
see another building. This one was 
long and narrow, and the greater 
part of it was built into the ground 
so that only about the top four feet 
of it was visible. The entrance was a 
steep stairwell scarred from rain 
and wind and choked with decay- 
ing leaves. 

The man raced down the steps 
and threw himself at the two great 
doors. He battered at them with 
his fists, then looked anxiously 
about, as if he had forgotten how 
to open them. Several minutes 
passed before he pressed his shoul- 
der against the back edge of the 
door on the right. Both immedi- 

165 




ately slid open and he hurried 
inside. I was right behind him. 

I had never seen anything like 
that building. It contained a long 
series of walled-in cubicles. Their 
front partitions were made of trans- 
parent glass or plastic. There must 
have been hundreds of them for 
they ran far beyond my line of 
vision, side by side, to the left and 
right of a narrow corridor, and each 
one of them held dummies, manni- 
kins. At l^t that was what I 
thought they were. 

The man stood before the pane 
of the first cubicle. He raised his 
hands and said, “It isn’t done yet, 
Radena. We haven’t lasted out the 
terror. But be assured that we 
wiU.’’ 

« YOU FOOL— she’s dead,’’ I 
X said behind him. “They’re 
all dead.’’ 

Living people couldn’t sit as 
those people sat. There were four 
in that first cubicle — a middle-aged 
man and woman, a young woman 
and a child. Dressed in blue robes, 
they sat stiffly on a velvet-coVcred 
couch and their eyes appeared to be 
focused straight ahead. The older 
couple was holding hands. The 
young woman beside them was 
slender and beautiful. A strand of 
her long golden hair touched the 
face of the child that lay. in her 
arms. 



“Radena,” said the madman 
outside the cubicle. Taking a step 
forward, he lifted one hand and 
placed it flat against the clear 
window. “Speak to me. I want to 
hear you.” After a long moment 
he sank to his knees and both hands 
went up to the glass. 

Behind him I said, “She’s dead. 
She can’t speak to you.” 

All of a sudden there came a 
whirring sound followed by a 
metallic click and someone spoke. 
In this v^lt of the dead there were 
noises, of living things. 

“Tero,” said a woman. “I speak 
but it is not my real voice you are 
hearing. Your presence energizes 
the recording mechanism. I was 
compelled to make the record be- 
cause my strength is nearly gone. 
Listen to me, Tero. We have called 
back all the physicians. They have 
joined us in the ancestral vaults. 
Look at them and know the truth.

penetrated the filtering systems 
and we are dying. You cannot find

called and called but you do not 
respond. Your mother and father 
beg you to come to us. Give it up, 
Tero. You broke your heart trying 
to save us and now eternity awaits. 
1 want to enter it with you. Please 
hurry.” 

The madman wept in his blind-

ness. His dull eyes lifted and saw 
movement where there was death 
and vacuum. His brain believed the 
lie. He perceived nothing that was 
real. 

“Patience, Radena,” he said 
gently. 

“We’ll fmd the cure. We are 
working night and day. Nothing 
can stop me. I love you.” 

Slowly he climbed to his feet and 
turned away, walked past me with- 
out knowing I was there. He left 
the sanctuary and swiftly climbed 
the steps leading to the fields and 
streams. 



1 WENT back to the lake. I took 
up my belt and gun and put 
them on. 1 left my clothes on the 
sand. From there I went to hunt 
for the festoons. 

In a nearby valley I found hun- 
dreds of them. In its independent 
state a festoon looked like a cube 
of glittering quartz a foot high and 
as many inches across. It appeared 
to be hard and impenetrable but 
legend said that it was soft. 

I approached a cube that rested 
in a patch of clover. Kneeling, I 
thrust my hands into the thing and 
it closed over me like a tender vise. 
As if from the other end of a long 
tunnel, a voice spoke in a hollow 
whisper. The inhumanness of the 
sound shocked me. This was the 



voice of alienness and it was 
intelligent. 

“Welcome,” said the festoon. 
“You desire me for your own?” 

“No. I only want some infor- 
mation.” 

Along the endless tunnel came 
the whisper, “In exchange for a 
sample of your life force?” 

“That depends on how much of 
it you consider a fair exchange.” 

The cube seemed to flow around 
my wrists. “You are creative.” 

“I assume that means I have 
energy to spare. But what if you 
decide to take it all?” 

“I destroy nothing,” said the 
festoon. 

I wanted to yank my hands out 
of the thing and get away, but I 
remained still. “What do you do 
with the life force of a host?” 

“The word is ‘companion.’ We 
arc not parasites. We are happy 
with a companion and require but 
a small portion of his energy. 
Already 1 am using yours and you 
do not even notice. Festoons and 
Spenicki rose together from primal 
molecules. They care for lis. We 
love them. We live as one.” 

“There is only a single Spenicki 
left.” 

“We could not combat the dis- 
ease and they perished one by one. 
A certain number concealed them- 
selves in the ancestral vaults in 
hopes that the few immunes would 



EMPTY EDEN 



167 




find a cure. It was all for nothing. 
The companions are dead.” 

“One of your kind is a criminal. 
It lives in the man Tero and con- 
trols his senses. It makes him blind 
and deaf.” 

Did the hollow voice chuckle? 
“I know of no maverick festoon.” 
“Never mind what you think you 
know. Tell me how to open the 
man’s eyes and ears.” 

“A festoon has little will of its 
own once it is insid^ a companion. 
Catch the man at a moment when 
his emotions are strong. Command 
him to hear, command his eyes to 
open and you will have the thing 
you desire. But you may not revel 
in his awareness. Beware of — ” 
“Don’t lecture me,” I Said. 
“What happens to you now that 
there are no more companions?” 
“We wait for others to come.” 
“The maverick festoon in the 
man wants to own him as long as 
it can. It blinds him so that he 
knows nothing of what goes on 
about him. How long can this con- 
tinue if no one interferes?” 

Like a whisper from the void 
came the answer: “For as long as 
he lives.” 

- “I’ll put a stop to it. I’ll force him 
to command the thing to come out 
ofhiih.” 

“You are leaving me now?” 

I am. 

“Wait. Grant me total entrance.” 



“No,” I said coldly. 

“You deny your own spirit. Even 
as we communicate you grow 
warm. You desire me, yet you say 
no. My species lives in loneliness 
and hunger.” 

“Release me.” 

My hands came free in an 
instant. The festoon rested on the 
grass like a block of quartz and I 
swiftly walked away from it. 

Where was I going? To track a 
man, to trace his footsteps. I 
stalked Tero as if he were already 
my own. 



H e ate from his garden so 
that he would have the 
strength to continue his hunt for 
specimens. ^ Inside his body the 
maverick festoon nourished itself, 
lazed and perhaps dreamed and the 
thin portion of it which shbwed on 
Tero's back looked sleek and 
smooth and glittered in the sun- 
light. He was easy to watch and 
easy^o follow. 

He caught a wriggling creature 
in the fields. 1 followed him into 
the lab and watched him murder it 
with his experimenting. Then I 
stood behind him as he wept and 
buried it in the cemetery. 

“Festoon, you’re a disgrace to 
your species,” I said. 

Tero gave no sign that he heard 
me. With a chisel he carved a 



168 



IF 




picture of the animar on a fine 
piece of stone. 

“You’ve blinded him completely 
to me, haven’t you?’’ I said to the 
creature he wore. I knew it could 
hear me because it was using Tero’s 
senses as if they belonged to it. 
“You would have let him kill me,” 
I said. “It was his subconscious 
that forced you to let him see me at 
the last minute.” 

Tero went away" to find another 
specimen and I let him go. I was 
hungry but the vegetables in the 
garden were not to my liking. I 
found an orchard of white fruit 
that tasted sweet and, as I stood 
and ate and did some dreaming of 
my own, something touched my 
foot. 

A festoon rested against my leg. 
In a moment it flowed around my 
foot and cherished it. I started to 
object and then changed my mind. 

“What is that noise?” 

“You hear with keenness,” said 
the festoon. 

The sound was gone then. Or 
was it? I looked about. There were 
only the orchard, the ground, the 
clear sky, yet there was an odd 
throbbing sound in the air and it 
seemed to be coming from nearby. 

“Someone is mourning,” I said. 

“Walk through the trees for a 
little while and you will see,” said 
the festoon, releasing my foot. 

Beyond the orchard was a valley 



where thousands of festoons con- 
gregated. There were large ones 
and small ones. Like chunks of ice 
they decorated the valley and their 
glitter was blinding. Beside me 
came the single specimen in a 
graceful rolling motion. As soon 
as it paused I plunged my. foot into 
it. 

“What are they doing?” I said. 

“Listen.” 

Their grief was heavy and their 
need intense. Pressing clo^e to one 
another, they sought comfort in an 
almost desperate manner. Suddenly 
they perceived my presence. In an 
instant their minds approached 
mine. I questioned. They answered. 
They let me see what had gone 
before on the planet. 



F irst came the dawn of the 
world and this was marked 
by upheavals. Then came the after- 
noon and the birth of man. Genes 
crossed in strange patterns that 
produced a two-fold entity, a 
double psyche or a twinned soul. 
A Spepicki newly born was a 
human infant and a festoon. The 
second was no more alien than the 
first. The two were one organism. 

On rare occasions when a festoon 
abandoned its young companion 
the child died. The festoon also 
died. The presence of the creature 
was essential to the child until it 



EMPTY EDEN 



169 




arrived at puberty, after which it 
rejected the festoon. This joined the 
common pool of festoons and 
waited until summoned by any 
Spenicki who desired it. They were 
unusual twins, spawned together 
to separate as the human soul 
groped toward maturity, the one 
to stand and wait, the other to 
strive for outward meaningfulness. 

The Spenicki were gentle. They 
were also intelligent. In the begin- 
ning they went to the stars, traded 
their culture and goods with people 
on other worlds, became known as 
the scholars of the heavens. Their 
language was adopted by many 
and the knowledge of the festoons 
spread. But there was much wrang- 
ling between star systems and 
eventually the Spenicki withdrew 
and went no more into space. On 
their own world they grew mightily, 
but not as warriors. They built, 
but not a great deal. Their 
scattered cities were temporary 
shelters where travelers paused 
to rest. The Spenicki were natural 
rovers and they had once again 
begun to look at the stars when the 
epidemic came among them. 

It was ironic that the brother- 
hood of festoon and man brought 
about the death of half the partner- 
ship. Knowledge of medicine was 
scant. Who needed a physician 
when one could take for himself a 
festoon who possessed the world’s 



knowledge? The twin saw into the 
labyrinths of the mortal body, 
viewed it as a house to be kept in 
order, had the power to control the 
inner workings and knew those 
inner workings intiihately. 

One day came a storm with 
lightning flashes so severe that 
the higher reaches of the atmo- 
sphere may have been disturbed. 
Soon after that the dust began 
drifting down. It was yellow and 
heavy and soon after it started to 
fall the Spenicki began to die. The 
festoons grew frantic because all 
their efforts to destroy the bacteria 
failed. 

Now there were no more com- 
panions — there was no more joy, 
no warmth in the brotherhood 
because there were no more broth- 
ers. Now the festoons gather^ and 
feared and became almost human. 
They wanted a miracle. 

They wanted me to give them a 
miracle. I understood what they 
meant. I was to go back where I 
came from, bring my people here 
and present them to their brothers. 
Were we not all one and the same? 

We weren’t the same and I told 
them so. The rest of the galaxy 
wanted no part of them. Festoons 
were taboo. 

M y explanation puzzled them, 
made them ask more ques- 
tions. 



170 



IF 




How could I teach a thing that it 
was repulsive when it had been 
conditioned to believe otherwise? 

I told them about racism-. This 
bewildered them. I talked of prej- . 
udice and they said it was illogical. 

I explained independent pride and 
they eagerly agreed that this was a 
good thing and then they spoke of 
a two-in-one singular twin. 1 con- 
tinued talking and they continued 
to reply, but neither of us could 
compromise. 

“You are not moved by our 
desolation,” said the festoon who 
was by now wrapped securely 
around my foot. 

I denied it. 

“We mourn,” they said. 

I shrugged. 

“Our lifespan is great,” they said 
and my glance turned cold. \ 

“We are your brothers,” they 
said and I denied it in a loud and 
forceful voice. 

“Another,” they said and I 
understood and became angry. 

I said, “My kind are all the 
same.” 

“Unlikely,” said the festood at 
my feet. The creature suddenly re- 
jected me without being com- 
manded. It set me free as if the 
contact with me were unpleasant. 
That made me more angry than 1 
had been. 

“I’m sorry,” I said to the throng 
in the valley. “You can’t expect me 



to do the impossible. Maybe the 
Spenicki wanted you but nobody 
else does.” 

They didn’t hear. They were as 
deaf as Tero. 



O HELL with them. I walked 
away from the valley and away 
from the orchard, tramped through 
the fields and climbed the hill, 
stood on the path and gazed down 
at the sanctuary wh^re the dead 
remnants of the Spenicki race sat 
and waited for time to destroy 
their atoms. 

I knew the fertoon in Tero was 
crafty. Would it permit him to 
know that his family was dead, let 
him know the world was empty, 
take a chance on the brother’s 
choosing swift and final dissolu- 
tion? Of course it wouldn’t. The 
festoon was fighting for its life. It 
had blocked me out of Tero’s 
awareness because I was strange. 
Anything strange might mean the 
end. Allow the brother to mow his 
lawn, dig in his garden, hunt for 
guinea pigs and grovel before the 
shrine of Radena, but never for an 
instant let him suspect the truth. 

I had wasted enough time. 
Climbing onto the roof of the 
sanctuary I gathered a pile of 
sticks and dead leaves. Then I set 
my gun at its lowest heat and set 
fire to the pile. Black smoke began 




EMPTY EDEN 



171 




to sweep upward and the wind took 
it. 

Several minutes passed and Tero 
came out of the lab. He saw the 
smoke and came running. 

“Stop,” he cried. I knew he was 
shouting at the wind. The festoon 
wouldn’t permit him to see me. 
Breaking a limb from a tree, Tero 
jumped to the roof of the building 
and swept the burning pile onto 
the ground. 

As I had known he would, he 
immediately went down to the 
building to make certain that all 
was safe. I was there and waiting 
for him. He raced in through the 
door and hurried over to the first 
cubicle. 

“Radena, are you well?” 

“Radena is not well,” I said, but 
his ears were sealed by the festoon. 
I gazed at him for a long moment 
before I turned and aimed the gun. 
What I wanted to do was bla^t the 
face of Radena, but then the effect 
might be ruined. He had to see her 
body topple over as the vacuum 
inside the cubicle was destroyed by 
inrushing air. 

The gun was still set at its lowest 
power. I didn’t increase it. Aiming 
at the top left corner of the trans- 
parent waH, I squeezed the trigger. 
The heat beam took out a corner of 
the wall and a section of the roof. 

Not waiting to see the bodies fall 
from the couch, I whirled to Tero. 



“See your dead woman?” I said. 
“Look at her and then forget her. 
Put her in the past where she be- 
longs. Live in the present and in 
the future with me. I’m here. I’m 
real. I’m not a ghost.” 

The emotions of Tero were 
stronger than the grip of the festoon 
and he suddenly saw what was 
happening in the cubicle. All at 
■once his body went rigid. I could 
see him trying to deny the vision 
before him but his emotions were 
too intense and the delicate chains 
of the festoon were annihilated. 

My hand was pressed against my 
mouth. I tasted blood and knew I 
had bitten myself. I had wanted to 
take pleasure from his pain but I 
couldn’t. The horror on his face 
was not satisfying to me. His terror 
seemed to grow in intensity and I 
was afraid he would die of shock. 



U NABLE to look at him I ran 
past him, hurried out of the 
building. I didn’t stop running until 
I was well away from the place. 

He came after me, I watched as 
he climbed the hill and I wanted 
to shout at him to hurry, to look 
alive, to be aware of me as a girl 
who had wanted him from the very 
beginning. 

He moved so slowly and he 
looked so old. The sunlight was 
being cruel to him. 



172 



IF 




But it wasn’t the sun. His spirit 
was dead. He reached the rise of the 
hill and came to a halt and I found 
myself looking at a zombie. His 
eyes were filled with tears. His 
arms hung at his sides. Even the 
brightness of his hair had faded. 
Limp and almost lifeless, he stood 
and looked at the ground. 

I shivered and gritted my teeth. 
“Get rid of the festoon,” I said 
harshly. “It’s your enemy. It lied 
to you.” 

For a long minute he made no 
response. Then his head finally 
came up and for the Hrst time he 
looked at me. I thought 1 was 
prepared for that first glance, in 
fact I was ready for practically 
anything, but no scorn or rage 
blasted at me from his eyes. Not 
even hatred. What he gave me was 
indifference — nothing. I was there 
but I didn’t matter. The distance 
between us might as well have been 
a light-year. 

Raising both arms toward the sky 
he said, “I tried,” and his voice was 
gentle. “In my own way I live and 
die. Festoon, go from me.” 

The creature came out of his 
pores like thick perspiration and 
this required no more than a few 
seconds. Its glittering mass col- 
lected on his chest and clung there, 
seemingly loath to let him go. From 
where I stood I could almost hear 
its faint wail of sorrow. 



“Goodbye, old friend,” said 
Tero. 

Then I knew. I swayed with 
shock. This was no maverick 
festoon. 

Tero’s will had been its will. 
It had hidden only what he asked 
to have hidden. The thing had 
always done what he wanted. He 
had preferred illusion and pain to 
the peace of death. He had re- 
mained in his blind torment for the 
purpose of seeing the one face that 
held meaning for him. Now that 
was gone. 

The festoon loosened its hold on 
his chest and dropped to the 
ground. 

I knew something else then. I 
knew death. I saw it come in waves. 
Tero stood silent and unafraid as 
time wreaked its final havoc upon 
him. 

For how long had the festoon 
brother held his body together as 
glue held bits of old paper? For a 
thousand years? For ten thousand? 
Or more? 

His marvelous physique was 
destroyed before my eyes. The gold 
of his hair became gray. Bones 
crumbled. Flesh shrank. The whole 
of what had been a man caved in- 
ward like weakened sod. In front 
of my eyes Tero died. His great 
bulk swayed, tottered, fell apart. 
What scattered at my feet were a 
few bits of debris. •

^ Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

In the Reading Room for August, 
1972, Lester del Key considers the fea- 
sibility of a brief description of science 
fiction as opposed to fantasy. He states 
that, in effect, one is forced to accept no 
definition at all or only a circular one. 

Now it is a simple and easf proposi- 
tion in formal logic to show that a dic- 
tionary either contains an undefined 
term or else all of its definitions are cir- 
cular. Mr. del Keys observation is an 
extension of this proposition, no doubt 
as readily demonstrated within the 
propositional calculus. 

Fortunately, for he had a sound 
reason for doing so, he refused to ac- 
cept this formal rebuff and went on 
about the business at hand, that of 
phrasing a succinct statement of what 
sf is about. Mr. del Rey is not a man 
easily put upon, or off, and his expli- 
cation of the state of affairs b con- 
vincing. 

His key words and phrases are these: 
rationality, fiction, alternate, and sf is 
that fiction which deals rationally with 
alternate possibilities. 

It will be objectionable to some that 
science has short shrift in his formu- 
lation. Science is one of the actualities 
ofsf 



Science is the binder, no less than the J 
base. To paraphrase from the ancient 4 
texts of rhetoric, science is the unity ^ 
and coherence of sf, whereas specula- | 
tion provides the emphasis and the ; 
difference. ^ 

It is science that raises the coefficient " 
of credibility to the level of consent. 

It is possible to go a little more in the > 
direction that science is essential. The 
universality of science is a major 
component of the credibility of sf And 
sf is the point of maximal convergence 
of fiction imitating science and fiction , 
imitating reality. Foe sf imitates science 
in the Aristotelian sense that art imi- 
tates nature. There is a pervasive in- 
stinct for ''other’ and it is science that 
, is, in this context, the compelling frtime 
that holds the work in its proper sh(q>e. 

Science is public, knowledge and has 
a social dimension (John Ziman). It is 
upon the first of these, among other 
things, that fiction relies for concur- 
rence with its inventions and for its 
background and milieu. Fiction is a 
part of the social fabric and sfis a part 
of the fabric of science, if only a patch 
thereon. 

The "scientific method" is an inte- 
gral part of any conception of science 
and it is implicit that, the use of science 
in sf brings with it the scientific method 
and leads to agreement with and 
reliance upon the imaginative 
constructs of this fiction. It is the sf 
writer’s use of the precepts of the scien- 
tific method that lends corroboration to 
what otherwise would be an unconvinc- 
ing narrative. 

Thus it seems at least to me that Mr. 
del Rey’s definition should have a fa- 
vorable reception — with the proviso 
that science is a necessary addition.- 

As to fantasy —

Alexander Doniphan Wallace

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

With all due respect to Mr. del Rey, 
fm afraid I find his definition of sf 
much too narrow. ** Fiction that deals 
rationally with alternate possibilities** 
is obviously one man*s description of 
what he personally likes — not 
necessarily what others like. And it 
manages to exclude most classic sf if 
not much of contemporary science fiic- 
tion. Certainly Doc Smith*s improb- 
able novels cannot be aassified as sf 
under Mr. Del Rey*s definition— 
theyre not possible alternatives— 
they* re fantasies. And yet people 
obviously think of them as sf de- 
spite their logical absurdity. (Unless 
science took a swift turn to the left we 
just didn*t have the technology to build 
a ship o/ Skylark’s size and potential in 
1927.) Also, what does possible** 
mean? Isnt the background and 
development of Seven Days in May 
possible — and isnt the story* s setting a 
'‘possible alternative** — and isnt it 
"fiction handled rationally**— and 
doesn't this, by Mr. del Rey*s 
definition, make it perfect sf? Yet 
aren't novels of the Seven Days in May 
genre precisely what Mr. del Rey 
condemns? 

Further, Mr. del Rey*s definition is 
apparently born of a feeling on his part 
that the boundaries of modern sf are 
becoming too blurred. Why he con- 
siders this bad 1 frankly don't under- 
stand— to me it indicates that sf is filled 



with vitality, a vitality that cannot be 
contained by narrow definitions. 
Describing sf, giving it regular shape 
and size, is like trying to contain the 
wind— a little bit always escapes and 
you're forced to become just a little 
larger in order to contain it all. 

It was once quite easy to pinpoint 
sf—it was pulp fiction, badly written, 
adolescently conceived, dealing with 
journeys within the realm of scientific 
imagination. That was a generation ago 
and it covered everything from the 
worst to the best. Now things have 
changed and we find it impossible to ex- 
plain just what it is about sf that we like 
or that, for us, makes it unique. 

Perhaps the most honest definition of 
science fiction is Damon Knight's: 
"Science fiction is what were pointing 
at when we say 'science fiction.* **

How 

do you speak 
without a 
voice box? 



How does 
a woman live 
without a 
breast? 



You go into 
a cancer operation 
and all you care about is 
coming through alive. 

And you come through. 

You’re alive. 

Now there you are, facing the hard 
part : How do you live with this 
drastic change? 

That’s when you need the kind of hdp you 
can only get from someone who has been 
through the same thing, 

A woman who has had a breast removed 
reassures another woman who has just had the same 
operation. She teaches her special exercises. She helps 
with her clothes problems. She knows how shattering it 
can be, and helps her pick up the pieces. 

A man who has lost his voice box helps another man to 
speak again. Instruction, yes. But more important, 
encouragement; the example of someone who’s lived through 
the same thing and overcome the same problem, 

“How can you possibly know what it’s like?” 

“I’ve been there.” 

That’s our program for rehabilitation. 

It’s not just enough to save your life ; we also care how well 
you live it. 

So if you need help, if you know someone who does, please" 
call our local Unit. We can help.
