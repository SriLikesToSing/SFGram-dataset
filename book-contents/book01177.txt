“Life on Mars wouM be a bore 
if we didn’t have something 
good to read... 




A popular storytelling magazine like 
FICTION is as indispensable as your life 
support system or gravity pack. When a 
four week dust storm is tearing away at my 
unit, I just relax with a good mystery or 
western. Some guys read poetry on those 
long buggy rides to perimeter points, so 
that their style with the females doesn't go 
stale. The woman I room with is always 
paging around for the sexy parts. Drives me 
nuts. ..My girl-friend is crazy about gothics 
and crossword puzzles. And of course there 
is always the science-fiction if your tastes 
incline in that direction. Personally, I like 
the reviews. When I touch earth again. I'm 
going to get a nice little job teaching 
literature at a girl's school and I've got to 
keep informed. ..That’s the way it is..."

‘". and through the chinks

and feel such refreshing airs of 
|liberty, as daily raise our ardour 
^ for more.” — Edmund Burke, 
A Vindication of Natural Society

I 

I T WAS the summer of 2008, a per- 
fectly ordinary year, but for the 
sake of context you should know 
that it was the ninth year of New 
Harmony and seventh of the first 
and original penal reservation, the 
F'astcoast Confinement. 

On J u ly 1 5th of that year, at 7:19 
in the morning, Berlin’s Superin- 
tendent of Police boarded Luft- 
hansa’s Flight 103 for the trans- 
atlantic trip to Eastcoast — and lest 
Karl Schmidt think that the Senate 
took his trip lightly, it sent a dele- 
gation of its senior members to the 
airport despite the early hour, who 
followed him all the way to the end 
of the ramp urging his objective, 
careful, and professional assess- 
ment of the American experience. 

Karl Schmidt undertook the voy- 
age yielding to pressure of the worst 
sort. He was fifty-nine and four 
years beyond retirement age, a fact 
that the Senate had at last turned 
to its advantage, suggesting 
through intermediaries that, should 
he continue obstinate and old- 
fashioned, the Senate could and 
\\ ould replace him with a man more 
modern in his outlook. But they 
hoped they wouldn’t have to. 

Schmidt stood before the 
senators, tall, grave, his long face 
somewhat longer than usual, his 
sparse grey hair combed back 
straight with a part in the center. 
He assured them that he’d do his 
best. ‘‘But gentlemen,” he said at 
the end, ‘‘don’t think that a single 



visit will change my mind. Old dogs 
don’t learn new tricks, and I’ve al- 
ways opposed aping the Amis, 
fheir solutions turn out to be to- 
morrow’s problems.” 

Just then they heard the muffled 
report of an explosion somewhere 
on the airport grounds. Soon there- 
after a voice announced yet another 
major sabotage attempt. Fortu- 
nately it had miscarried. With the 
exception of an old bus, no damage 
had been done to man or property. 

The senators looked pointedly at 
Herr Schmidt, and he in turn 
shrugged his shoulders. The men 
would be caught. Justice would be 
done. A few hotheads, anarchists, 
and antisocials shouldn’t panic 
society to adopt the drastic Ameri- 
can solution. Schmidt understated 
the problem, of course. It was 
pretty grim in Europe. He himself 
sometimes felt desperation as he 
watched Western Society unravel 
before his eyes. But nothing could 
convince him that Confinements 
were the answer. The Senators 
obviously disagreed. He saw it in 
their eyes. Schmidt is too old and 
set in his ways, they thought. Too 
bad he is a public institution in 
Berlin and difficult to shunt aside 
without political pain. 

C VER THE Atlantic, in the perpe- 
I tual sunshine of high altitude, 
Schmidt reflected on past and 
future. 

Since his birth in 1949, the world 
had transformed itself under the 



7 




twin pressures of growing popula- 
tion and shrinking energy supplies. 
It had all turned out differently 
than he'd thought it would, in his 
early twenties, when world catas- 
trophe had been predicted. Instead 
the world had carried on, creaking 
and groaning like an old weary 
ship, too stupid to know that it 
should sink. Atomic war had been 
avoided, but ip its stead had come 
disorders all over the globe — not 
least of which had been the Chino- 
Kussian war of '79, an incon- 
gi^iously bright period in Schmidt’s 
life, for he had served in the Inter- 
national Intervention Brigade and, 
incidentally, had trained in the 
U.S. before the IIB was mobilized. 
Then in 1999 came the disaster 
some people said Nostradamus had 
predicted. It hadn’t been a man- 
made holocaust but a geological 
happening that had reduced the is- 
lands of Japan to the Keys of Japan 
in a series of convulsions and had 
pidlcd much of California into the 
sea. Flooding on a scale unheard of 
since Noah had lightened the 
planet’s human cargo, and men 
still cleared debris after nearly a 
decade. China was now once again 
the spoil of warlords who paid a 
kind of distracted allegiance to the 
ghost of the People’s Republic. 
Russia was the Sick Man of Asia, 
preoccupied in putting down inter- 
nal revolts. Europe had fragmen- 
tized into thirty-five sovereignties, 
and the fragments had been gather- 
ed into the Union of Europe ruled 



from the cantons of Switzerland, 
presumably safe from the sea. And 
America had become a theocracy of 
sorts. 

The United States were now 
United Harmonies or New Har- 
mony or simply Harmony. The re- 
gime called itself the New Puri- 
tan Secular Order. NPSO was the 
brainchild of a single man, one 
Ralph Waldo Gunnison, a tiny, 
withdrawn, wispy figure who’d 
spent forty years as an obscure 
teacher of Mental Science at night 
while repairing TV sets by day. He 
reached prominence in 1978 as 
leader of the Meditation Crusade. 
His object was simple enough. He 
saw preparations for the Interven- 
tion and proposed an alternative. 
Let the American people pray and 
meditate, and let the boys stay 
home. He theorized that Mind 
could grab hold of Substance in 
deep prayer and thus force its de- 
sire into Manifestation. Let Ameri- 
cans pray for peace on the Mon- 
golian border. The force of Spirit 
could overcome the force of the 
Sword. This appealed to a popula- 
tion torn by Vietnam 11 (which was 
really l.aos 1). Gunnison became a 
pest in the Senate, organized pro- 
tests against the Intervention, and 
predicted awesome disasters when 
the nation went off to war again, 
fhe natural disaster came in ’99, 
two years after the Peace of Tchu- 
lA'h. It coincided with a severe re- 
cession and other disorders. Gunni- 
son became the first Harmonizer,

GALAXY 




and the New Puritan Secular Order 
was launched. 

Karl Schmidt had passed 
through the United Harmonies in 
2001 on his way to Brasilia, which 
had emerged as a dominant force in 
world politics, inadvertently filling 
a vacuum created up north of it. 
International conferences now 
tended to be held — if they were 
held in the New World — in San 
Paulo or Brasilia. No one liked 
prudish Miami, prissy New Fran- 
cisco, or drab Eastcoast. The 
changes had been visible then, but 
nothing like he expected to see 
now. Mind had indeed transformed 
Substance and made Manifest a 
world in Ralph Waldo’s image and 
likeness. And the people loved it. 
The world wanted to emulate it. 
And people of Berlin lusted after 
harmony, tired of the social 
disease, the dissolution of order 
and meaning, that plagued all erst- 
while industrialized countries — ex- 
cept America, of course. 

Uniformed girls served lunch a 
little ahead of Schmidt’s accustom- 
ed meal time. He picked at the food 
but ordered three bottles of wine 
anticipating a dry time in East- 
coast. Then he opened his slender 
briefcase and took out the briefing 
materials for a second perusal. 
After a while he laid the papers 
aside and shook his head much as 
he’d done some days ago in his 
widower apartment in the blue- 
plush armchair beside the empty 
paraqueet cage by the window 



where he did evening work. He 
couldn’t reconcile himself to the 
notion of confinements. He won- 
dered at the brazen boldness of the 
erstwhile TV repairman who’d 
dared launch a social experiment of 
unprecedented proportions and un- 
predictable consequences. Yes, 
Schmidt expected that conse- 
quences would flow from this 
sooner or later, despite claims to 
the contrary made in the Harmony 
brochures. 

In such musings and under the 
mellow' influence of rhenish, Karl 
Schmidt dozed off. A stewardess 
lifted his head and gently slipped a 
pillow' beneath it without his notice. 
He slept soundly until the plane be- 
gan its descent. 

T he plane approached low over 
water. In the distance to the 
right brightly painted sailboats 
swayed unevenly in waves created 
by a small tugboat bound out to 
sea. The plane moved over solid 
ground. The wheels touched down 
and the engines reversed. The 
green blur became immaculately 
combed lawn, and up ahead large 
white billboards with blue lettering 
came toward them as they rolled 
forward. Soon he could read the 
signs. Meditation, Substance, 
Manifestation. Karl Schmidt had 
arrived in New Harmony. They 
taxied to the gate, and a voice an- 
nounced the local time and wel- 
comed them to Peaceful Abiding 
International Airport. 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

Schmidt gathered his hat and 
briei'case. He lined up with others 
on one of the five aisles of the 
jumbo and deplaned past the tired 
smile-masks of the girls. To him 
this was and would remain 
Kennedy International, the airport 
where he had arrived on his first 
trip to the United States, a young 
man mesmerized by dreams of ad- 
venture and tired of the Vice Squad 
in Berlin. He’d been bound for an 
Oklahoma training field of the 
International Intervention Brigade 
but had stopped a while in New 
York City to taste the forbidden 
fruits of MJ and Synthesex — legal 
in the States but, at that time, still 
prohibited in Germany. Schmidt 
w as sure that no one smoked mari- 
juana now in Harmony, and the 
orgasmic sex-drug that had been all 
the rage in the late ’70’s was surely 
taboo. 

fhe letter of invitation had 
promised him a full-time guide and 
aide, a certain Richard H. Gilligan, 
executive assistant to Easteoasfs 
Commissioner of F^olice. Schmidt 
walked out through the mobile gate 
peering ahead at the people who’d 
come to meet the Bight. A young- 
ster in a bright red jacket with a 
blazer caught his eye. He had a 
pink, scrubbed, wholesome look, a 
reddish crew cut, a freckled face. 
I he youngster saw Schmidt’s 
searching look and moved toward 
him with the hesitant expectation 
of a man greeting a relative 
stranger. “Herr Schmidt?” “Mr. 



Gilligan?” The young man’s hand 
came forward and gave his a tight, 
manly grip. 

“Welcome to Harmony, Herr 
Schmidt. Welcome to Eastcoast. 
You have a good Bight? 1 sure hope 
you did; we want you to be happy 
w ith us. Get off to a good start, and 
all that. Herr Schmidt, have we got 
things to show you!" 

fhe young man was tense, ap- 
parently, and he effused when he 
was tense. 

“1 am very curious, of course,” 
Schmidt said evenly. “I’m sure it’ll 
be interesting.” 

“I’ll say!” Gilligan enthused. 
"You better believe it, Herr 
Schmidt.” 

In an attempt to ease the young 
man’s tension, Schmidt said: 
"Perhaps we better make that 
‘Karl’ from now on.” 

“Sure, Karl, anything you say, 
sir. Just call me Hank. Name’s 
Richard H., you know. The H. 
stands for Henry, and that comes 
out Hank. 1 don’t use ‘Richard.’ 
Haven’t used ‘Richard’ since I 
ji>ined the force. The boys kid you 
loo much. They call you ‘Dick 
Dick' and things like that. You 
know what 1 mean? Dick? Detec- 
tive?” 

Schmidt nodded gravely. “I 
understand you perfectly. Hank.” 

“ fhis w ay, please, Karl, if you’ll 
just follow me . .” 

I hey w alked through an echoing 
hall. Schmidt noted the asceptic 
(uder and the unparalleled neat- 



10 



GALAXY 




ness. He reealled a tourist poster 
he’d seen on the Kurfuerstendam: 
WE MAKE SWITZERLAND LOOK 
DOWNRIGHT DIRTY. VISIT THE 
HARMONIES. Nowadays,, of course, 
it took little to exceed Switzerland 
in cleanliness. It was the hub of the 
F.uropean Union and something of 
a moral as well as aesthetic slum. 

1'hey moved toward the male side 
of the Customs line. Gilligan was 
pleased that the guest spoke such 
excellent English, but the old 
man’s gravity disturbed him. 

Gilligan was uncommonly aware 
of the great responsibility he 
carried. All civil seiwants in New 
Harmony knew of the Harmonizer’s 
personal wish to see Order expand 
into the Zones of Decadence. In 
seven years of service, Gilligan had 
never had so obvious a chance to 
make his mark as now. Of the 
thirty-live states of Europe, Berlin 
was the best candidate. Berlin 
seemed most decade;nt of all Euro- 
pean states as if. in gaining its free- 
dom with East Germany’s drop 
IVom the shrinking Soviet orbit, the 
city had lost its rationale for living. 
Now. for the first time, a Uni-Eu 
representative was here to see and 
listen. Many officials of much 
higher rank would address the 
visitor. Nevertheless Gilligan’s role 
was superlatively important — Herr 
Schmidt’s general comfort and well 
being were in his hands. He could 
have a striking innuenee on the im- 
pression the German gained during 
his stay. 



Absorbed in such reflections, he 
shepherded the German through 
the baggage search. He paced ner- 
vously up and down outside the 
sanitation show'ers where green dis- 
infectant streams bombarded every 
traveler. He led Herr Schmidt, now 
in a fluffy robe, to the cavitation 
baths where ultrasonic waves ex- 
ploding under w^ater blasted dirt 
from every pore. He supervised the 
louse-spray operation. And finally, 
he rushed about solicitously to help 
the Super find his microwaved 
clothing basket in the irradiation 
hall. 

As they went out into the 
terminal proper, the German said: 

“Are you sure we didn’t miss a 
step in this process. Hank? It seems 
to me they forgot to pump my 
stomach.” 

Gilligan laughed nervously. To 
distract the German from the abso- 
lutely necessary sanitation require- 
ments (after all this was New Har- 
mony, not an underdeveloped 
nation), he pointed ahead and ex- 
plained that the gentlemen up front 
in red jackets, such as the one he 
w ore, were heads of various offices 
of the Department, and the tall, big 
man in their center (he didn’t want 
to say “obese”) was the Commis- 
sioner of Police for Eastcoast. 

I'hen, indicating the newsmen and 
the rV cameras, he expressed the 
hope that Herr Schmidt might 
address a few’ words to the waiting 
Media. 

Schmidt felt both apprehensive 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



11 




and amused as they moved for- 
ward. The Eastcoast police officials 
in their blinding ,red jackets 
grinned expectantly as Schmidt ap- 
proached. They reminded him of 
salesmen at a convention. All the 
people in the terminal were neat 
and tidy to a fault. Despite his 
rather thorough cleansing, he felt 
dirty, as if the decadence of Europe 
still hung about him like a musty 
odor. 

Warm, hamlike hands clasped 
his, and a huge, gross man bubbled 
his welcome. 

To Gilligan’s relief, everything 
went smoothly. The ComPol did 
the introductions going from man 
to man. They were all here, of 
course. Supply Logistics and 
Barrier Engineering and Legal and 
Psychological and all the rest, plus 
the Regional Crusade Rep and a 
man from the Lord Mayor’s 
office — in short a VIP reception if 
Gilligan ever saw one. ComPol even 
remembered to give Dr. Fieldgreen 
of Adjustment Education some- 
thing of a little build up. They’d de- 
cided, in laying out the Sales 
Strategy, to show Schmidt the 
VPLE test tonight even before his 
briefings tomorrow. Tonight was 
the first routine application of the 
technique. 

Then Herr Schmidt spoke briefly 
to the press, and while Gilligan had 
hoped for more enthusiasm, at 
least Herr Schmidt said nothing 
negative. 

ComPol walked them to the heli- 



copter with his arm around Herr 
Schmidt’s shoulder. Herr Schmidt 
seemed a bit discomfited by that, 
but then the ComPol couldn’t help 
it; he was a regular glad-handing 
hugger of a man. 

“Now, Karl,’’ the ComPol boom- 
ed, “we’ve got it all laid out for you, 
old buddy, a little tour, a little nap, 
dinner, and then a night operation 
just to get you off to a good start. 
And all that before your visit offi- 
cially kicks off tomorrow.’’ He 
turned to Gilligan. “Now' see here. 
Hank, you make sure Karl here 
gets whatever he wants. Any old 
thing! And if you need help, holler. 
Just give me a ring.” He stopped 
and, still holding Schmidt by the 
shoulder, he let his arm describe a 
large circle. “Pretty now, isn’t it, 
Karl. Every last bit of this ter- 
minal’s new, built after the Flood, 
and those mosaies are our pride 
and joy.” 

The ComPol pointed to the excel- 
lent portraits of the Harmonizer all 
around. Each showed Gunnison in 
a classic pose — Meditative, Pen- 
sive, Executive, Lyric, and Tragic. 

Schmidt was a big man, nearly 
two meters in his stoekings, but he 
felt almost frail next to this giant. 
He glanced absently at the Har- 
monizer’s five images but his mind 
lingered with anxiety over the pros- 
pect of dinner. The steaks would be 
five centimeters thick, no doubt, 
and ComPol w'ould insist that he 
eat his raw. Ah, these Ameri- 
cans .

They went on, and soon they 
walked in sunshine. Then they 
crossed macadam and mounted 
narrow stairs to the copter. Down 
below Com Pol waved an arm. 

Inside the airship Gilligan intro- 
duced him to the pilot and showed 
him a good seat. And then, alone at 
last with Schmidt, he rubbed his 
hands and said: 

“What’s your pleasure, Karl? 
Shall we check you in at the hotel, 
or shall we take a look-see at good 
old EC?” 

“EC*^” 

“The Eastcoast Confinement.” 

“Aha,” Schmidt said. “By all 
means let’s look-see good old EC.” 

Gilligan said: “Let’er rip, Brew- 
ster.” 

The blades began to turn. 
Moments later they were airborne. 

T he scene below reminded 
Schmidt of a favorite Gunnison 
slogan: Let All Things Be Renew- 
ed. Whatever had been had been 
erased by floodwater, bulldozer, or 
crane. Schmidt saw what he’d al- 
ready seen in countless newscasts — 
the prim geometricities of New 
Harmony. Neat-as-a-pin suburbs 
rushed by. Shiny red trolleys 
shimmered up through the foliage. 
Uniform small cars, all brightly 
waxed, beaded the highways. 
Schoolyards teemed with uniformed 
children (here vacations had been 
abolished) and shopping arcades 
with shopping women. 



“So,” Schmidt said, peering out. 
“So this is Harmony.” 

“Impressive, ain’t it,” Gilligan 
beamed. “Must look good to you, 
coming from where you come 
from.” 

Schmidt chuckled. “Oh, it’s not 
so bad, Berlin. We struggle on in 
all our decadence.” 

“1 guess you’re right, at that. 
One gets used to it. Still, if it’s any- 
thing like it used to be here . .” 
Gilligan shook his head. “I remem- 
ber how it was, Karl. Something 
else! Filth, pollution, mobs, 
weirdos! And headlines!? Head- 
lines like you can’t believe your 
eyes! Jesus, how did we ever live?” 
“How indeed,” Schmidt said 
with a tiny smile. He kept peering 
at the scene below'. 

“1 don’t know why you folks put 
up with it over there,” Gilligan 
said. “You don’t have to. We 
don’t. We’ve got the technology if 
you’ve got the will. We’ll make a 
deal with you. We’ll send the ex- 
perts, you provide the labor. Any- 
thing for a cause.” 

Schmidt took his eyes off the 
landscape and turned to Gilligan. 
“The Clean World Crusade?” 

A gleam of enthusiasm brighten- 
ed Gilligan’s eyes. “Yessir! That’s 
the name of the game.” 

As they approached Manhattan 
island from the south, Gilligan 
turned tour guide and explained 
this and that. Schmidt only half 
listened. He sought for some sign of 
the old city, but there was precious 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



13 




little to see. Massive holograph pro- 
jectors set into the Hudson’s banks 
simulated the ancient skyline, of 
course, this being tourist season. 
Gilligan explained how that bit of 
illusion was generated and at what 
energy cost. But through the 
ghostly image of the past, Schmidt 
saw only squat, uniform buildings. 
Immediately ahead of them, Gilli- 
gan explained, was Eastcoast’s ad- 
ministrative center. Schmidt had 
inferred that. People walked about 
in the red jackets of Gunnison’s 
civil service. He saw a formation on 
a roof top. Chanting? Praying? 
Doing yoga? 

Governor’s Island passed by on 
the left. It was still a Coast Guard 
station but now the service had 
been renamed. Sea Wall? Beach 
Sweep? Something like that. The 
men wore odd, pointed blue caps 
with yellow pom-poms on top. The 
Harmonizer took an interest in uni- 
forms and was said to be a crack 
designer in addition to his many 
other superlative talents. 

They flew over East River and 
left troubled waters in their wake. 
Garbage barges on the right moved 
toward some distant dumping 
ground much as they’d moved in 
the old days, but now the barges 
were painted white and even the 
garbage had a primly piled look. 
Then the copter rose to clear the 
bridges, and Schmidt saw the huge, 
shimmering bubble of irridescence 
even before Gilligan pointed to it 
with a dramatic gesture. 



“There she is, Karl. Beautiful, 
isn’t it. Just look at her! Just look at 
her shine! " 

The Eastcoast Confinement. 

“What you’re seeing there,’’ 
Gilligan explained, “is a dynale- 
tonic laminar flow of lectromag 
radiation. Ozonified, too. Only its 
not just one laminate but about fif- 
teen hundred plies, like. It’s about 
four meters thick at the bottom, 
but it thins out on top. We generate 
it in a Lunac converter. Darn ex- 
pensive, energy-wise. Sixty thou- 
sand kilo-cals per square meter of 
surface.’’ 

To the fifty-nine year old eyes of 
a policeman it was just a shimmer- 
ing bubble, an extremely large 
bubble. It began around Forty- 
Second Street (if there was still 
such a thing) and extended away to 
the north as far as the eye could 
see. A blue-grey haze above it sug- 
gested smoke. 

Passage through the barrier 
wasn’t lethal, Gilligan said, but it 
caused temporary paralysis and ex- 
treme nausea followed by migraine. 
The field’s strength increased geo- 
metrically with each breaching, 
and mass exodus from the Confine- 
ment was practically impossible. 

Schmidt nodded. He understood 
all this, and Gilligan’s explanation 
was superfluous. He wondered 
what went on inside. The human 
aspect interested him far more than 
the whizz-bang stuff. Americans 
knew and loved whizz-bang. But 
did they understand the sociology? 



14 



GALAXY 




They made toward the bubble, 
approaching it fast. On the left 
Schmidt saw midtown Manhattan, 
the transformed Manhattan. He 
could see into the straight, uniform 
streets and inspect the low concrete 
buildings, each exactly the same as 
the other. The monotony was re- 
lieved only by large billboards. The 
people in the streets, however, were 
reassuringly people — women chat- 
ted in doorways and little children 
ran and bicycled about. 

Then they left the city behind 
and flew parallel to the barrier for a 
while. At one point the ship began 
to vibrate and the copter veered to 
the left. 

“Neutralizer,” Gilligan said. 
“Brewster just turned it on.” 

They moved through. For a 
second, but only for a second, 
Schmidt felt a surge of nausea and 
pain at his temples. 

T he Eastcoast Confinement 
could be divided fairly neatly 
into four quadrants. This was not a 
physical division, purely, although 
il was also that, complete with 
w alls, towers, w ater or rubble-filled 
trenches, and all the rest. Rather, it 
arose from the tribal patterns with- 
in the reservation. In the east where 
the helicopter entered, Peacefreak 
held sway — and a bloodthirsty 
hunch they were too, Gilligan said. 

1 hey faced the Maoling redcaps on 
the west and adjoined Ecofreak to 
the south. Panthermess had its do- 
mains on the north, but Gilligan 



explained that Panther “fingers” 
extended well into the other terri- 
tories. The Panthers were much in 
demand for the medical services 
they provided. Each tribe was fur- 
ther subdivided into so-called 
“packs,” and each pack had its 
own “turf’ and took part in the 
foodwar in a kind of rotation, like. 

Gilligan wondered what else 
Schmidt needed to know by way of 
context w'hen the German asked 
him curtly why none of this was in 
the literature he’d been sent. Gilli- 
gan replied that it was all of mar- 
ginal interest compared with the 
technology. He worried a little be- 
cause Herr Schmidt had begun to 
frown in an odd sort of way, and so 
Gilligan hastened to assure him 
that very ample sociological data 
were available and would be pro- 
vided in the course of briefings to- 
morrow' afternoon. 

Schmidt frowned because he was 
thinking. Here it was. His oldest 
arguments with the Senate came 
back to him now. He had argued 
with the gentlemen politicians. He 
had told them what he had suspect- 
ed — namely that inside the Con- 
finements lived societies as legiti- 
mate and real as those outside. He 
had never been able to buy the 
NPSO propaganda to the effect 
that the people Inside were the 
dregs of the earth, incompetents, 
incapables, antisocials, degener- 
ates — people, in other words, 
w hose presence in the larger society 
represented a danger to the whole. 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



15 




He knew it couldn’t be that simple. 
He had cited the facts of life to the 
Senate. Even penitentiaries were 
organized into societies. What 
Gilligan had told him, and what he 
now saw, convinced him that he 
had been right. 

Dow n below he saw a part of old 
New York — a jumble of buildings 
high and low , canyons and valleys 
and open spaces, real brick, ce- 
ment, steel, and glass rather than 
holographic images. It should have 
looked like a grim urban desert, 
but it wasn’t quite that. Everywhere 
he saw green, green of every con- 
ceivable shade — the dark green of 
bushes, the light green of new 
sprouts, the variable green of carrot 
tops, cabbages, lettuce, turnips, 
and other plants he didn’t recog- 
nize. It seemed as if old Manhattan 
had been overgrown with vegeta- 
tion. It greened on rooftops, 
streets, squares, yards, window- 
sills. 

Next he was struck by the mass 
of people. He saw them everywhere, 
fhey swarmed down there in 
clumps and bunches. They sat 
darkly, fhey worked in rows 
amidst the green. Faces turned up 
toward them and hands waved. 
.Schmidt imagined that he saw the 
people smile, but he couldn’t be 
sure of that. 'They ilcw too high and 
a blue haze from a thousand chim- 
neys obscured the view. 

They moved over a mile-long, 
snaking queue and Gilligan point- 
ed to it. 



“That’s a food line down there, a 
pack distribution point. And that 
over there, that clump of men with 
axes? See the red hats? Maoling 
slaves tearing up the pavement to 
make more strip farms. They culti- 
vate every bit of land they can 
find.’’ 

“Maoling slaves?" 

“Yep. That’s the latest. In the 
last couple of months Peacefreak 
has started taking slaves, and our 
guess is it's spreading all over the 
Confinement. They work ’em twenty 
hours a day on half rations. Keeps 
the population down.’’ Gilligan 
chuckled. 

“Your food shipments . .?’’ 

“Not enough; not nearly 
enough.’’ Gilligan chuckled again, 
“l et’s face it, Karl. We’re not try- 
ing very hard to keep’em alive in 
here; but they fight back.’’ 

S CHMIDT meant to follow up on 
that remark, but his attention 
snagged on a weird, impressive 
structure that now detached itself 
from the haze. It was a dome 
topped by three slender needles of 
unequal length. The building stood 
in a large square of cleared ground. 
Masses of people tilled the square 
with a dark dotting of heads. The 
structure seemed made of bits and 
pieces of waste material — glass, 
briek. steel, and plastie all welded 
together in a loose reticulation. The 
massive construct gleamed in the 
mixed light of afternoon sunshine 
and shimmering barrier. This was 



16 



GALAXY 




certainly not old New York, nor 
was it New Harmony. This was 
something new and somehow alien, 
(he expression of some kind of 
spirit; Schmidt sensed a kind of 
grandeur and defiance in this 
aggregation of materials. 

He pointed to it. “And that?” 
“That’s Sophia Grande.” The 
lone dismissed the whole thing in 
such a way that Schmidt, already 
alerted, grew suspicious. 

“What is it? A church?” 

“Our Lady of the Expansion.” 
“fhat wasn’t in my briefing 
package either. What is this? Some 
sort ol' recent development?” 
Gilligan- shook his head and 
curled his lips in an expression of 
contempt. “Naw, not really. The 
structure is fairly new, but the myth 
is almost as old as the Confine- 
ment. They say down there that the 
liarricr will come down some day 
and the people inside will inherit 
(he earth. They say a woman will 
lead (hem, so they built her a 
cluirch.” The voice expressed 
scorn, and Schmidt had a momen- 
tary glimpse of a slightly different 
Kichard H. Gilligan, Gilligan the 
hard-nosed cop. For a second there 
was silence filled only by the 
chopping whirr of blades. “Fat 
chance.” Gilligan said. “Cold day 
in hell. We’ve got this barrier on a 
lusion plant, and that, believe me, 
ain’t gonna run out of fuel.” 
Silence. “Brewster, you better get 
up a bit. fhey’re bound to take a 
shot at us.” 'fuming to Schmidt, he 



pointed down. “See that double 
wall and the water trench? That’s 
the border between Peacefreak and 
Maoling. There. Those dark half 
circles? Catapult nests.” 

A religious myth strong enough 
to engender a public works built by 
a mass of people under some kind 
of tight coordination would mean 
the presence of real culture down 
below , something that these dregs 
of humanity were not supposed to 
possess. Schmidt set that aside for 
the moment and concentrated on 
the scene. 

Near the catapult nests half- 
naked men worked feverishly. In 
seconds fire-darts rose up toward 
them reaching for the copter’s 
bottom-mounted fuel tanks. But 
Brewster had lifted the ship in a 
right-leaning circle and the darts 
fell short. The ship passed almost 
directly over Sophia Grande as it 
turned, and Schmidt got a better 
look at the shining needles of the 
construct. There was something 
odd about the light reflection and 
the geometry of the panels laid on 
(he needles’ surface. What had 
seemed like panes of glass to 
Schmidt from a greater distance 
now resembled panels of some 
kind. Solar panels? But that, of 
course, was ludicrous. The technol- 
ogy was denied to these miserable 
inhabitants of this incredible, green 
ghetto. More likely small hot- 
houses used to grow food. 

“How many people live in here?” 
he asked. The Eastcoast Confine-

merit looked tar larger than he’d 
imagined from the literature. 

“Right million, give or take, 
we— ” 

“Rxciise me, Hank; did you say 
eight million? The literature — ” 

“I know, Karl. The offieial sta- 
tistics only list principals, and there 
are only two million principals 
down there.” 

“Principals?” 

“I don’t want to anticipate your 
briefings, Karl, but here goes any- 
way.” Gilligan’s tone turned tu- 
torial. “Crime is a social phenome- 
non. not an individual thing. When 
the Mind embraces crime, it pol- 
lutes or infects all those who 
co-vibrate with it.” 

Gilligan turned to Schmidt to see 
if the German followed him. This 
was deep stuff, and Europeans 
were terribly skeptical. That’s why 
the World Crusade made so little 
progress in the Zones of Decadence. 
But the German seemed receptive, 
and Gilligan \^ent on: 

“When someone commits a 
crime, we obviously find the co- 
vibrators, too, and in they go, the 
whole lot.” 

“I take it, then,” Schmidt said, 
that ‘co-vibrators’ are . what? 
Husbands, wives, children?” 
Gilligan nodded. “That’s right, 
Karl, fhat’s why we have eight 
million down here, although the 
exact number isn’t known. Eight 
million’s a guesstimate. The input 
is down to a few thousand a year, 
and (hey kill that many in the food- 



war and the tribal raids. On the 
other hand, the birth rate . .” 
Gilligan pointed to the copter’s 
padded, stitched ceiling and shook 
his head. “You’d swear they’re 
deliberately breeding. Goes to show 
you that they’re antisocial. It’s sui- 
cide to breed in a confinement, 
social suicide.” A thought made 
him smile. “Gunnison says we 
might have to import people from 
the Confinement one of these days. 
Anti-fcr is working too well on our 
side. F^opulation on the Outside is 
down to a hundred and fifty 
million, but counting all of our 
Confinements, all forty-seven of 
them, the Inside population’s push- 
ing sixty and it’s growing.” 

In the silence Schmidt pondered 
that relationship. The birthrate was 
up? In all other industrial nations, 
it was dropping at an alarming 
rate. 

“Say. Karl, why not!” Gilligan 
cried suddenly. “Let’s just do it 
right now . I'he official tour isn’t till 
Friday, but you might as well get a 
look at the best population control 
device ever invented — and the 
oldest.” He chuckled. “Brewster, 
let’s circle by the Pile for just a sec, 
and then you’d better head out 
again.” 

T he w Olds “foodw ar” and “pile” 
did not appear in the literature, 
but Schmidt understood the refer- 
ence. I he population w as supplied 
by helicopters equipped with 
neutrali/ers such as this one had. 



18 



GALAXY 




Schmidt expected a large mob 
scene at points where the food was 
distributed . people trampling 
each other. But when they came 
upon the scene, he saw with the 
cold horror of a man whd’d seen 
many things that it was worse than 
that. This was a real war. 

Long before they reached the 
spot. Schmidt saw the busy move- 
ment of large transports far away 
behind the haze of smoke. They 
came in from the Jersey side in an 
endless line. Huge bales swung by 
cables from the bottom. The ships 
dipped, released the bales, rose up 
high again, and headed back. 

The locus of the deposition was a 
large square surrounded by old 
brow list ones. In an area five blocks 
square the ubiquitous green of the 
(Tmllnement was conspicuous by 
absence, fhe copters came in and 
released bales in the center of the 
scpiare. and it was indeed a huge 
pile of materials. In a circle all 
around it. defending the mouths of 
street radiants, men fought a fierce 
battle against attacking masses — 
but it wasn’t a mob against a mob 
so much as organized military for- 
mations against organized de- 
Icnders shielded from roof-top 
arrow lire and wheeled catapult 
tlarts by barriers built of broken 
crates, sacks of sand, and concrete 
rubble. 

Brewster brought the ship to a 
hover, and they watched the fight. 
Below them a long line of women 
and children marched southeast in 



single file. They carried crates on 
back, head, and slung on bicycles. 
Schmidt w as reminded of ants. 

“Peacefreaks again,” Gilligan 
said in a tone of displeasure. “They 
dominate the distribution. Peace- 
freaks. sec? You can tell by the 
yellow band they’ve got tied around 
their arms and the yellow shirts 
some ofem wear. If we were closer 
you could see the symbol. That’s 
the Hundred and Twelfth Street 
Pack. Our records show that 
Peacies are in charge here 
sixty-four point two percent of the 
time. And they only have 
thirty-three point nine percent of 
the population.” 

“Are you sure it’s point nine?” 
Schmidt asked. 

“Absolutely,” Gilligan said. 
“You’ll see, Karl. We’ve got this 
technology down pat. Every trans- 
port brings back a report, and it 
goes right into a computer. We 
know all about these birds. Stats, 
everything. Nothing you have to in- 
vent lor yourselves in Berlin. We’ll 
come in and set it up for you free of 
charge. And we’ll guarantee that 
it'll work.” 

“I’m sure it will. Hank,” 
Schmidt said. 

Gilligan looked at the German. 
He heard something in the man’s 
voice. But the long face was 
serious, and the gray eyes were 
fixed steadily at the scene below. 

“Nose down a bit, Brewster. 
Herr Schmidt might want to see the 
symbol.” 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

“There’s no need for that,’’ 
Schmidt said. “Does it go on like 
this all the time?’’ He watched a 
salient of men in red railroader 
caps. They had stormed over the 
bodies of their dead and had cut 
and slashed their way past the bar- 
rier to a corner of the Pile. Immedi- 
ately a column of women ma- 
terialized in the feeder street, and 
men began to throw bales and 
sacks across the barrier. 

“Twenty-four hours a day.’’ 
Gilligan answered. “Not on the 
Sabbath, of course. We don’t 
deliver on the Sabbath.’’ Gilligan 
shook his head. He watched the 
battle with a professional eye. 
“I’eacefreak’s too strong.’’ he said. 
He turned to Schmidt. “You’re just 
in time to sec us try a little innova- 
tion tonight. Com Pol mentioned it 
to you. What we call an adjustment 
operation. Peacefreak’s too strong 
and must be weakened, or else we’ll 
get unification down there, and 
that’s dangerous.’’ 

“Why so?” 

“ fhey’ve got some awfully smart 
people in there. Physicists, chem- 
ists, people like that. Brainy folks 
are often antisocial. They could in- 
vent a neutralizer in no time at all. 
But they can’t massproduce’em — 
not so long as they keep fighting. 
So we keep’em off balance.’’ 

“What’ll you do, exactly, to- 
night?’’ 

“Peacefreak’s too well led,’’ 
Gilligan said. “That’s w'hy they 
keep gaining turf. We’ll pick up 



some of their chiefs on girly raids 
and . .’’ Gilligan hesitated, look- 
ing for the word. “Let’s say we’ll 
give them a bit of education — that’s 
permitted by the Constitution. Our 
stats people say four chiefs should 
do it. Peacefreak will drop down to 
around thirty percent or so.’’ 

“In population?” 

“No.” Gilligan gestured toward 
the battle. “In RD.” 

“In RD?” 

“I^esourec Dominance. Control 
of the pile.” 

They watched in silenee as the 
redcapped men were dislodged 
again by the furiously slashing 
counterattack of blood-drenched 
Peacefreaks. 

Gilligan gestured. “Maoling 
can’t do it. They’re too weak and 
starving too fast for OPMB.” 

I'he initials were multiplying. 
“OPMB?” 

“Optimum Population Mass 
Balance,” Gilligan said. “You’ll 
get all that in the briefing tomor- 
row. Have you seen enough?” 
Schmidt nodded. Involuntarily 
he thought of a rat trap he had once 
seen. It'd been a box with a trap 
door, fhe rats fell down into the 
box and were slowly starved into 
cannibalism. As the copter rose 
and turned again, this time to the 
south, he made a note to ask about 
“girly raids” and to inquire how it 
was that “education” was “per- 
mitted” by the Constitution, and 
how much “education” would 
weaken the leadership abilities of 



20 



GALAXY 




Peacefreak tribal chiefs. But for the 
moment he didn’t want to pursue 
the matter. He was tired. His inter- 
nal body-clock told him it was 
eleven at night, although here the 
sun still shot oblique rays into the 
smoky atmosphere beneath the 
barrier. 

II 

E mmanuel Toronto Salazar 
Smith. Or Emmanuel Smith. 
Or Manny, for short. 

Manny stared at the gorgeous 
three-color graffiti painted on the 
bathroom wall above the toilet that 
no longer worked and had never 
worked and wouldn’t be allowed to 
work even if it did — the fecal 
matter was too precious to waste. 
What you didn’t put, on the crops 
you burned as fuel. The graffiti was 
a bold yellow swirl faintly resem- 
bling an E and a double S. A red 
border enclosed the letters, and two 
fat green dots hung over the rump- 
like curve of the last letter on the 
right, riiey called those dots the 
eyes of Emmanuel Toronto Salazar 
Smith. Or Manny, for short. Every- 
one knew Manny-Man in the ten- 
block turf where that symbol and 
those eyes warned interlopers to 
stay off Brinco territory. 

He shifted his eyes from wall to 
mirror to help clumsy hands tie the 
bright yellow tic under the collar of 
a starched white shirt. A neat suit 
jacket hung from the rusty hook of 
a shower-curtain rod. Manny 



flicked a bit of dust from its arm 
and then put it on. Neat and tidy. 
You had to be spotless out there or 
the squeeze would nail you before 
you even saw the chickie line. He 
had w orn his raiding suit four times 
in his life, and this was the fifth 
time. It brought back memories of 
pain and a kind of fear that he 
never felt inside the Realm. It was 
the fear of his cells, the fear of his 
blood, the fear of his guts, the fear 
not of Manny-Man but of that 
which Manny-Man carried about 
with him. his bod. The fear was al- 
ready beginning. It would grow 
slowly on the way to the chapel. It 
would grow greater and greater 
w ith every step of that endless walk 
south to the border. And finally it 
would be there screaming in his 
brain when he’d face the Fire, 
riial’s w hy he had delayed so long. 
But now the time had finally come. 
He couldn’t stay Manny-Man much 
longer without a Queen. His eyes 
would be put out, covered over, and 
the Pack would sell him off to 
Maoling as a common slave. 

He pulled the jacket down and 
pulled in his chin. Almost. He look- 
ed almost puritan. The face was a 
bit too Latin — dark and swarthy 
despite the camouflaging powder, 
riiey said that browns and blacks 
lived out there, and they did, but 
Manny knew and they all knew in- 
side the Realm that browns and 
blacks didn’t belong in Harmony. 
Slowly they brought them all in 
here and shoved them in through 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

the barrier loeks, with the locks set 
at full force, so you’d get a good 
feel of what it was like, crossing the 
Fire. Manny didn’t mind so much 
with the young men and women. It 
did them good to know what it was 
all about. But it hurt with the 
oldies and the children who rolled 
around on the ground twitching 
and spasming and throwing up the 
precious food they’d brought in 
with them in their stomachs. 

He turned and swept the gold 
into his hand from the empty water 
tank of the useless toilet. He stared 
at the pendant for a second then 
put the whole mess into his pocket. 
He was ready to go. 

In the Big Room lounging rubes 
looked up from chores. They were 
busy with whetstones sharpening 
swords or tipping arrows or dipping 
darts into steaming asphalt re- 
claimed from pavements lifted up 
to make more farms. They broke 
into derisive laughter and pointed 
fingers at him. They made noises in 
the cheeks and called him Neaty- 
toe and Sensy-wensy. But Manny 
sensed their approval now. There 
was a joy and glee in their abandon- 
ed yelping. They saw him dressed 
and they were reassured. He half 
suppressed a smile and gave them 
the thumb. At the door he turned. 

“Tonight,” he called. He fixed 
them with dark, brooding eyes 
whose whites were almost dark 
yellow and were marked by fine red 
arteries. They rested swords, darts, 
and arrows and settled down to 



listen. “Tonight we’ll have a 
Queen.” 

Manny ran down stairs. The 
rube cheer resounded behind him 
and echoed dully through the bare 
brick halls of the ancient building. 

He walked through dark streets 
eyeing the w alls. Competing graffiti 
had mushroomed here and there in 
the last day or so. His rubes had 
claimed they couldn’t stop it. He 
suspected that some of them had 
painted signs, eager to be pack 
chiet' themselves. “You lost your 
stroke. Your queen’s fled. You got 
no gripe, Manny-Boy.” Manny- 
Boy, the rubes had said. Not 
Ma nny-Man. 

Folk lined the sidewalks three 
deep getting a breath of night air. 
1-yes followed him and heads 
nodded in approval. They saw his 
raiding dress and they knew that he 
was Manny-Man again now that 
he’d resolved to take the Ordeal 
and do it again — go up against the 
Man’s wall for a Queen. Back in 
charge . if he came back. 

Manny didn’t know how it had 
all started, the business with the 
t|uccns. It lay very far back, several 
years, and in the Realm you lived 
one day at a time. Suddenly they 
were there. One pack had one and 
then another. Packs with queens 
(lid better in the war. The Virgin 
Mom had Idretold this long, long 
ago. back when they were still 
building the engines and you could 
still go out ol'the Realm by subway. 
And then it was like this. You had 



22 



GALAXY 




to have a queen. The people de- 
manded it. And the only real queen 
was one you took from a chickie 
line. They waited for you. They had 
precious things hidden away in 
their clothing and on their 
body . things that the squeeze 
would catch at the official gates 
with detectors. The people said 
those precious things guarded the 
pack luck. Manny-Man had his 
doubts about that, but you never 
knew, and without the queen the 
rubes led poorly and the boys didn’t 
fight. 

He headed for the Brinco chapel 

aware that women detached them- 

• 

selves from the crowd and came in 
his wake like an ever-growing 
comet’s tail. He saw it up ahead, 
the gleaming chapel, still only half 
finished. One spire of burning 
steel-glass-stone reached up above 
the dark, surrounding tentements. 
Four holy panels from Sophia 
Grande had been installed already 
to make pow er in the chapel’s base- 
ment. They had lathes and drills 
and other machinery down there 
that the queens had told him to as- 
semble. It was holy work indeed. 
One year, tw'o years? The work 
moved forw ard slowly, but the time 
would come some wondrous night 
when neutralizers would open up 
the barrier in a thousand places 
and the folk would burst from the 
Confinement and rage over the 
land like a herd of hungry locusts 
following Her lead. 

He stopped for a second and 



looked at the construction — a won- 
drous design he’d made himself, 
modeled on the Grande. When it 
was done, the Lady would smile on 
Brinco. No other pack in Peace- 
freak would have a chapel so beau- 
tiful. Someday they’d call it Em- 
manuel Toronto Salazar Smith’s 
gift to Her of the Expansion. 

He entered the chapel and kissed 
the stone book’s nipple by the door. 
“Mercy please,’’ he murmured. 
Head inclined he walked toward 
the empty wood-cage suspended 
from the loft above the votive light 
extinguished now that no queen sat 
and prophesied from the cage. He 
knelt down, careful not to smudge 
the raiding suit. 

Slowly he let the feeling rise in 
him. 

It came readily enough. He felt 
longing and desire. The holy bed 
stood on the right. Four weeks had 
passed since she’d been here. He let 
the feeling expand from the par- 
ticularities of that one girl into the 
universality of the Lady. Emotions 
choked him, and the feeling burst 
out in a sob. 

“Queen Mother,’’ he cried with 
lifted head sensing the people in the 
darkness behind him, feeling their 
emotion of dread at the agony in his 
voice. “Queen mother, precious 
bride and crone.” 

His voice rang clear with erotic 
ardor. It shivered him to say it. 

“You saw fit to leave our midst 
as a slave to Maoling.” 

“Maoling,” the women murmur- 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



23 




ed in the back. The murmur grated 
with harsh anger. Yes. They looked 
at the right altar railing ruined in 
the last assault when a handful of 
rubes and men had died in that sur- 
prise raid weeks ago. Manny had 
been at the Pile with most of the 
men. The redcaps had ravished her 
away. 

“Queen Mother Bride!” 

His eyes filled with tears of long- 
ing. Emmanuel Toronto Salazar 
Smith had loved Betty Simple, 
Brinco’s queen. He’d dreaded the 
time when she would leave him in 
the course of things to journey to 
Sophia Grande. But she’d been 
taken before her year was up. He 
sobbed. He almost saw her pouting 
in the cage. She always pouted and 
her oracles were mixed with dark 
obscenities. But she had clung to 
him always in sacred intercourse on 
Janenights when the people came 
w ith candles. He saw her lay on the 
holy bed raised high on carved stilts 
below the cage. She had a yellow 
bow tied jn her hair and peace signs 
painted on her naked thighs. 

“Queen of Expansion, give my 
heart strength,” he sobbed. “Se- 
cure me in the fire of the wall. 
Make me invisible to the squeeze. 
Grant me a queen for Brinco whose 
lips shall call the future clear. 
Mercy thanks.” 

“Mercy thanks,” the women 
\\hispered, and it sounded like 
w ind passing over straw. 

Manny bent his head. 

Slowly a lone voice behind him 



took up the Hymn in reedy tones. 
Then they all came in, a hundred 
Brinco fem-folk voices. The sound 
grew and enveloped him. 

Lady High in gracious splendour 
Grant us now the land beypnd. 
Homage to you now we render 
To secure the Sacred Bond. 

Jee, jee, jimeny high, 

Jee, jee, jimeny low. 

To secure the Sacred Bond 
To secure the Sacred Bow . , . 

M anny-man Toronto Salazar 
Smith rose, turned, and 
passed out between the women. 
Their dark eyes rested on his 
powdered face in serious, question- 
ing expectation. At the door a 
deaconess gave him the wooden 
flower painted white and affixed to 
the end of a carved stick. Four 
times he’d held the stick; this was 
the fifth time. It would secure his 
passage through friendly and hos- 
tile territories despite the puritan 
threads and the yellow tie. 

Soon he left behind the last of the 
yellow -red graffities with the green 
eyes of Manny-Man. He marched 
with fixed gaze, flower stick held 
high, fhe people made way for him 
and murmured “Mercy thanks.” 
1 hen later he entered Ecofreak 
land and they said nothing at all 
but let him go from pack turf to 
pack turf toward Forty-Second 
Street where lately Eco’s had 
breached another wall and let 
raiders use the gap for a decagram

of gold. The gold was in his pocket. 
Five rings, two armbands, forty- 
five teeth, and a pendant. He 
wasn’t sure about the pendant. 
That might be amalgam. 

Security tightened around Forty- 
Fifth Street. Ecofreaks knew they 
had a good thing. This was sup- 
posed to be one of the best gates 
through the Fire, a low-pressure 
spot in the shield. (They all claimed 
(hat, of course, they all did, and it 
was never true.) This pack had no 
need to fight on the Pile every eigh- 
teen days. Not when you had a 
gate. They had the gold and bought 
the bread. Checkpoint followed 
checkpoint. Each had a little scale 
and he had to empty his pocket. 
Each time a shrewd man fingered 
(lie pendant. 

“fhat’s amalgam.” 

“It may be that, but I’m a gram 
over.” 

“So you are, Peacy, so you are.” 
fhey examined the seal on the 
liottom of the tlower-stick pressed 
there by the Virgin Mom of Sophia 
(jrande with a ring on melted poly- 
ethylene. Then they waved him on. 
I hesc men said “Mercy thanks.” 
I'or them it was a business. They 
didn’t take sides. 

At the last stop they took his 
wealth and gave him directions. 

“Down into the sub over there, 
three llights. Then you go along the 
rails to the right for eighty meters, 
give or take. And then you’ll see a 
eave-in on your left with a narrow 
break to the left of that. Through 



there. In a bit you’ll see the 
shimmer. Good raiding.” 

To them it was all routine. 

“How' much for a torch?” 

“Four nails.” 

“Jeez. You rubes know to 
squeeze.” 

The men shrugged. 

Manny-Man gave up four 
precious cigarettes and they lit a 
torch for him from one stuck in a 
crack in the wall. 

Emmanuel Toronto Salazar 
Smith set out with a torch in one 
hand and a flower in the other 
dow n dark stairs to get a queen for 
Brinco Pack lest the Lady frown 
and the pack fail in battle on the 
Pile. In a way he held their future 
in his hand. 

T he dinner in Karl Schmidt’s 
honor was drawing to an end. 
Servants served ice cream to the 
guests who sat in bright red jackets 
around the oval table in a private 
dining room of the Crusade House. 
On the walls hung tapestries with 
slogans. 

fhe Special Assistant to the Lord 
Mayor had the word. 

“Herr Schmidt,” he said, “you 
ask about the philosophical basis of 
the Confinement. Let me put it like 
this, flic basis is mercy and free- 
dom. fhe guidance laid out in the 
Harmonizer’s Science of Morals is 
clear. He writes, ‘And make no 
mistakes about it. Punishment is 
presumption, but nonviolent with- 
drawal is permitted.’” 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

The Lord Mayor said: “That’s a 
mouthful. ’’ 

The youthful Regional Crusade 
Rep broke in eagerly: “What Hen- 
dricks is saying, Herr Schmidt — ’’ 

“What I’m saying,” Hendricks 
asserted, “is that we have eliminat- 
ed punishment. It no longer 
exists.” 

The Lord Mayor: “It’s gone, it’s 
gone.” 

The City’s Secretary for Per- 
petual Harmony leaned over his ice 
cream dish and gestured with an in- 
dex finger: “The Constitution ex- 
pressly forbids punishment, and we 
abide by that.” 

“But we have a Cosmic Right to 
live in harmony,” Hendricks aug- 
mented. 

The Lord Mayor: “There you 
have it.” 

Hendricks: “We may withdraw 
nonviolently.” 

The Secretary: “And we’ve done 
so, in effect.” 

The Rep: “While we allow the 
dissidents every freedom within the 
boundaries of the Confinement.” 

“They live in bliss with their co- 
vibrators,” Schmidt said. 

“All have the same rights, of 
course. Principals and co-vibrators. 
We make no distinctions what- 
ever.” 

fhe Lord Mayor shook his head: 
"None! None!” 

Hendricks continued: “They 

have their lives, and we have ours, 
and that’s the Lesser Harmony.” 

“And the Greater?” 



“That’ll come in time. We have a 
program we call Gradual Life Sup- 
port Cutback.” 

“GLSC,” the Rep threw in. 
“Which is being implemented as 
their indigenous agriculture im- 
proves. Ultimately — ” 

“Pardon me, Mr. Hendricks, but 
do you honestly expect eight million 
people to live off agriculture on a 
part of Manhattan?” 

“We don’t play numbers games 
around here, Herr Schmidt,” Hen- 
dricks replied. “Eight million, two 
million, a hundred thousand. As 
the Harmonizer has so aptly 
written, ‘All things reach their ap- 
pointed level.’” 

Schmidt said: “With all due re- 
spect, Mr. Hendricks, but back 
home we’d call that genocide,” 
The Secretary for Perpetual Har- 
mony broke the brief, awkward 
silence: “Herr Schmidt, GLSC re- 
lies on gradual adjustments, 
natural attrition. We expect the 
birthrate to drop inside.” 

“But now' it’s rising.” 

“A temporary phenomenon, 
Herr Schmidt.” 

The Lord Mayor nodded: “Tem- 
porary, temporary.” 

The Regional Rep explained: 
“We believe that the rate of growth 
shows signs of declining. Our ex- 
perts on population dynamics ex- 
pect that once a certain point is 
reached, the birthrate will take a 
sharp dip.” 

“It seems to me that point 
should’ve been reached long ago.”

rhe Secretary shook his head: 
“Under normal circumstances, 
maybe. But these are antisocials.” 
“Antisocials and their co-vi- 
brators, don’t forget,” • Schmidt 
said. 

“Yes, of course.” 

“Look here, you guys!” The 
booming voice was the ComPol’s. 
He had been silent too long. “Karl, 
here, he’s a practical man. Let’s 
not bend his ear with philosophy 
and stuff like that. The Confine- 
ment works. That’s where I come 
out on this. Hey, Karl, how about a 
little steak sauce. The rest of us are 
on ice cream, and you haven’t even 
touched your steak.” 

Schmidt waved a hand defensive- 
ly. “My stomach is still in Berlin.” 
“Hey, that’s a good one,” Com- 
Pol chuckled. “His stomach’s in 
Berlin. Karl, that’s what I like 
about you, your sense of humor. 
Say, you won’t mind watching to- 
night’s operation, will you? Time 
change, and all that?” 

“You’ve convinced me that it will 
be interesting.” 

The Rep broke in eagerly: “We 
finally think we’ve solved a big 
problem, Herr Schmidt. The Com- 
missioner has said it well. The Con- 
finement works, but — ” 

Hendricks cut in: “But that 
doesn’t mean that we don’t have 
very real practical problems.” 

The Lord Mayor: “Very real.” 
“For example?” 

The Secretary took a turn to 
elaborate: “I think that all of these 



gentlemen would agree that there 
remains a significant danger from 
within.” 

“From w ithin the Confinement?” 
“Yes.” 

“The Ghengis Khan threat.” 

The Rep began: “What Mr. 
Hendricks means — ” 

“1 mean the danger of unifica- 
tion.” 

The Lord Mayor nodded gravely: 
“Ghengis Khan, yes!” 

Com Pol took the floor: “You’ve 
got to see it like this, Karl. There’s 
a lot of real smart alecks in there, 
too smart for their own good.” 
Schmidt said: “I believe Gilligan 
mentioned that to me. He fears that 
neutralizers might be invented 
and — ” 

“Hell, w'e assume they’ve done 
that,” ComPol said. “We’re 
worried about mass production. 
They might start that if they ever 
unify under some Ghengis Khan.” 
Hendricks took the lead: “In 
practical terms, Herr Schmidt, 
we’re limited in what we can do. 
The Constitution is clear on the 
subject, and so are the Har- 
monizer’s writings. We may 
withdraw nonviolently, but we can’t 
meddle with their internal politics.” 
The Lord Mayor said: “No. That 
would be wrong, that’s for sure.” 
Schmidt looked around and 
addressed them all: “Isn’t that a 
little incongruous? You lock up a 
third of the population but you 
scrupulously avoid interference on 
some Constitutional basis.” 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

“Herr Schmidt.” Once more the 
Secretary filled a silence. “I think 
all of us would object to the phrase 
Mock up.’ Sequestration is the term 
we use, and it is far more descrip- 
tive. ‘Locking up’ implies a form of 
punishment. We don’t punish in 
New Harmony. You might, in Ber- 
lin, but we don’t deprive people of 
their Freedom. We merely se- 
quester them into their vibrational 
community.” 

I'he Rep came in eagerly: “The 
writings arc quite explicit on the 
subject. Why, in Moral Science the 
Harmonizer writes — ” 

“Farley,” Hendrieks broke in, 
“Herr Schmidt is not all that in- 
terested in the writings. I’m sure. 
But now that you bring it up, the 
quote you’re groping for is: ‘The 
just seek justice and the base base- 
ness. Let us therefore establish a 
place of justice and a place of base- 
ness. and let Mind sequester 

the wheat from the chaff.’” 

The Lord Mayor agreed: “Well 
put. well put.” 

“Nevertheless, you do want to 
interfere.” 

“We merely want to ensure that 
the Sequestration remains effec- 
tive." 

“Why don’t you let Mind do 
that?" 

file Rep eagerly threw in: “The 
Harmonizer writes: ‘Mind works 
through Man as Man works 
through Mind.”’ 

“So you have to give Mind a 
Hand?" 



The Secretary for Perpetual Har- 
mony smiled painfully and said: “I 
see, Herr Schmidt, that your sense 
of humor is very active, indeed. 
You sense a contradiction here, but 
the conflict is more apparent than 
real. Precisely put, the doctrine 
goes something like this: The 

‘hand’ you refer to is actually a 
manifestation of Mind. Farley’s 
quote should be understood in its 
poetic, not in its metaphysical 
sense. It appears in the Har- 
monizer’s Science of Aesthetics.” 



C omPol had grown restless 
again: “As one practical man to 
another. Karl, let me say this. 
We’re lucky as hell that the boys in 
(here go on girly raids regular as 
clockwork, or we’d have our work 
cut out for us." 

“ fell me about that. The phrase 
intrigued me when Gilligan used it 
(his afternoon." 

“Girly raid?” 

“Yes." 

“Well, it's like this. Karl. When 
you’re dealing with weirdos and 
crazies, there’s always something 
like that — something you can’t ex- 
plain. and the girly raids are one of 
those things. The big studs in 
there, the chiefs, they have to kid- 
nap their girls from the Outside. 
It’s a kind of . of a ... an act of 
what-you-ma-call it . machismo, 
like. 1 mean, those guys go through 
agonies coming and going, and I 
guess it makes them look pretty big

in the eyes of the crowd inside.” 
The Rep interjected: ‘‘Of course, 
there is a more sophisticated ex- 
planation — ” 

‘‘Which is,” Hendricks continu- 
ed, ‘‘that there’s a differential 
moral pressure on this side of the 
barrier that pulls the chiefs. As it 
says in the .Science of Morals, ‘The 
Victim is by far the stronger in such 
cases, acting like a magnet on 
filings.”’ 

The Lord Mayor: ‘‘Apt, apt.” 
The Secretary said, pointing with 
a spoon: ‘‘1 see that you’re puzzled, 
Herr Schmidt. What Hendricks 
means is that — ” 

“1 was coming to that,” Hen- 
dricks said. ‘‘The theory is simply 
that we have a certain number of 
unidentified co-vibrators out here 
who attract the chiefs.” 

“Let me see if I understand 
you,” Schmidt said. “You’re saying 
that the girls — some girls — wish to 
be kidnapped and so — ” 

“That’s evident — ” 

“ — they get what they deserve?” 
“Where I come out on this,” the 
Com Pol said, reasserting the prac- 
tical again, “is that they come-, and 
that gives us a chance to educate 
them.” 

“Gilligan mentioned that. What 
do you do? Use some kind of 
drug?” 

“Goodness no,” the Rep cried. 
The Secretary was also shocked: 
“That would be clearly illegal.” 
Hendricks: “A breach of the 
Constitution.” 



The Lord Mayor: “Breach, that’s 
the word.” 

ComPol said: “Karl, let me tell 
you what w'e’ll be doing tonight and 
in the future. We’ll vipple the guys 
and send them back in.” 

“‘Vipple’ stands for Victim-Per- 
petrator Life Exch^inge,” Hen- 
dricks explained. 

The Rep chimed in with: “It’s an 
educational tool, pure and simple.” 

“It ain’t simple!” ComPol pro- 
tested. “It takes up three floors of a 
good-sized building. And it’s 
damned expensive, too. But it 
should work. The boys tell me it’ll 
work. It’s like this, Karl. Used to 
be, we lectured to the chiefs. For 
one day. That’s all we’re allowed. 
We used to lecture them till they 
were blue in the face. But that 
didn’t work. Now with vipple, we’ve 
got ’em.” 

The Secretary held up his hands. 
“Gentlemen, gentlemen. You’re 
going too fast for Herr Schmidt. He 
looks from face to face and I see 
that he is confused. Let me explain, 
Herr Schmidt. VPLE is a new dis- 
covery, a phenomenal new device 
invented in our penal laboratories 
by Dr. Fieldgreen.” 

ComPol: “You met him this 
afternoon.” 

And the Rep: “It’s a conscious- 
ness expander.” 

Then Hendricks: “Let Herb ex- 
plain.” 

“What it does, Herr Schmidt, is 
this. It transfers the experience of 
one person to another, and vice-

29 




versa. Clearly you get a tremendous 
expansion of eonseiousness.” 

“ fhat’s possible?” 

“We’ve done it!” 

ComPol added: “Works like 

gangbusters.” 

The Rep exulted: “It’s a real 
breakthrough.” 

Sehmidt shook his head. “I don’t 
see how that would serve your pur- 
poses. How will that incapacitate 
the chiefs? That’s your object, isn’t 
it? To destroy their effectiveness?” 
Hendricks pushed his ice cream 
dish aside and said: “Whatever 
makes a chief a chief in there, it 
must be his superb adaptation, 
right?” 

“All right,” Schmidt said. “1 
would agree.” 

“Adaptation’s a state of mind, 
right?” 

Schmidt shrugged. “All right; go 
on.” 

“With VPLE, we expand the 
guy’s consciousness. That changes 
his state of mind.” 

“Right,” Schmidt conceded, 
“but it doesn’t follow that he’ll be 
maladapted. More likely, he’ll be 
better adapted.” 

“Not so,” Hendricks said. 

“He loses his charisma.” the Rep 
intcriccted. “and that’s what these 
boys rule by. in there.” 

“ I hey become much more ‘re- 
llcctivc’ — that’s the phrase.” This 
was the Secretary. 

“Wc’vc got proof in the case of 
Abe Her/enberg Sultzy Chico 
Kid.” 



fhe Lord Mayor nodded: “Yes, 
the Kid.” 

“Abe Herzenberg . .?” 

ComPol saw his opening. “We’ve 
only vippled one guy so far. Abe 
Herzenberg Sultzy Chico Kid. (All 
of these guys have these long 
names — more machismo.) We 
knew it’d work from the animal ex- 
periments, but we had to have a 
test case — for the legality of it. So 
we vippled the Kid, and then w'e 
had some friends of ours file a 
friendly suit.” 

fhe Rep: “It went all the way to 
the Celestial Arbiters.” 

Hendricks: “And the case held. 
VPl.n is a legal educational tool.” 
fhe Lord Mayor: “Legal’s the 
word.” . 

“Put what I wanted to say, Karl, 
is that it worked on this Sultzy Kid. 
Afterwards he was kind of a 
zombie, like, and so was the 
victim.” 

Lor a second there was silence. 
1 hen Schmidt began: “So you have 
a new technical innovation that, in 
effect . .” He stopped. Richard 
H. Gilligan had appeared at the 
door of the dining room. “It 
appears, gentlemen, that my guide 
is ready to take me from your 
midst.” 

Heads turned. Then Hendricks 
said: “Herr Sehmidt. Let me try to 
sum up the Lord Mayor’s thoughts 
about your visit, fhe people of Ber- 
lin and the people of the United 
Harmonies have a long and friendly 
history of mutual cooperation.

We’d like your eity to be the first on 
the Continent to try a confinement. 
Conditions warrant it. Your people 
want it. Your Senate would vote for 
it if only you withdraw your opposi- 
tion. The Mayor has that assurance 
from the delegation that came to 
visit us last year. The time for 
action is now, and we are at your 
service." 

The Lord Mayor said: “My senti- 
ments, my sentiments." 

Ihe Regional Rep: “Such a 
venture w ould cement our deep cul- 
tural ties." 

And the ComPol: “Karl, old 
buddy, believe me, it’s good to 
know they’re behind that barrier, 
all nicely sequestered up, the whole 
damned lot of them, safe and se- 
cure." 

Finally, the Secretary for 
Perpetual Harmony: “A toast, 

gentlemen. 1 give you the Berlin 
(onllnement." 

Schmidt gave his glass of carrot 
juice a tiny lift. But he didn’t drink 
to w hat he judged was pious, igno- 
rant, official genocide, no, not even 
to be polite. 

T hey drove out of the Eastcoast 
Police Compound over a ribbed 
metal surface that made talk diffi- 
cult in a vehicle Gilligan had called 
a van but Schmidt would have de- 
scribed as a station wagon. He sat 
in front between Gilligan and a uni- 
formed chauffeur. 

It was nighttime in Manhattan. 
Schmidt found it odd to drive 



through what seemed to him more 
like a military reservation than a 
city (with its low concrete build- 
ings. virtually empty streets, and its 
“buttoned-up-tight-for-the-night” 
atmosphere) while all around flick- 
ered a luminous replica of old New 
York. Sometimes the streets pro- 
jected by the holograph generators 
didn’t coincide with the real, the 
new , the neo-puritan road, so that 
the van drove through buildings, 
statues, lamp posts. 

When they got off the ribbed 
street and the high-pitched hum 
stopped, Gilligan began to describe 
the operation that lay ahead, but 
Schmidt only half listened. His 
mind still mulled over the dinner 
conversation. 

Gilligan said that catching a 
chief was relatively easy once you 
knew the exit points he used. The 
barrier could be crossed at any 
point, of course, but the chiefs 
always came out underground to 
avoid detection. The surface was 
constantly patroled, and it was easy 
to pick them up as they spasmed on 
the ground. It took the better part 
of half an hour to recover from pas- 
sage, and the chiefs liked to do so 
in privacy, of course. Now up ahead 
was an underground breach the 
Peacefreaks liked to use because it 
was near their territory, and that’s 
where they were going now. The 
Department had set up an observa- 
tion room from which the breach 
could be watched through hidden 
cameras. Once a chief was spotted. 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

detectives would follow him until he 
made his move against a girl. Then 
they’d hustle him off to be vippled. 

Gilligan asked Schmidt if he had 
been told about VPLE, and the 
German said yes, he’d been told a 
little something. Gilligan then 
launched off into a description of 
that. He knew a lot about the 
animal tests that had been con- 
ducted and the technology — work, 
he said, that had grown out of ex- 
periments with brain wave control 
in the sixties and seventies. But 
when Gilligan noticed that Schmidt 
was pensive, he stopped, and they 
rode on in silence. 

Schmidt thought about RD, 
OPMB, GLSC, VPLE. His detailed 
briefing package had made no 
mention of these things. Nor had 
there been mention of complex 
social arrangements inside the Con- 
finements. No. Nor mention of a re- 
ligious movement that had throw 
up a truly intriguing, original 
building. Despite its humble ma- 
terials and seemingly random con- 
struction, Sophia Grande (even the 
name had stuck), reminded him in 
an odd sort of way of the cathedral 
in Cologne. Our Lady of the Ex- 
pansion. It darkened his mood to 
think about that. Was it possible 
that an authentic new religion had 
been born inside the Confine- 
ment— a new inspiration that 
would die along with the people 
when Harmony carried out “grad- 
ual life support cutback’’? GLSC. 
Schmidt imagined a conversation 



between Harmony officials. Said 
one: “Let’s glitch the bastards.’’ 
Said the other: “Yeah, let’s glitch 
’em, let’s glitch 'em good.’’ 

On the left people in spic-and- 
span clothing streamed out of the 
lighted rectangle of a large concrete 
building, a Meditation Hall. They 
v\ere gone in a flash as the van 
drove by, but they set Schmidt to 
thinking about the people on the 
Outside. Not the officials, the little 
people. How did they feel about the 
Confinements? America had be- 
come a remarkably quiet and 
placid place since the so-called 
“Renewal,’’ that period of a year or 
more after Gunnison’s take-over. 
They were said to resemble the 
Japanese of antediluvian times. 
(The Japanese resettlements on the 
Asian mainland were areas of tur- 
moil, passion, and disorder. Class 
war raged. The Japanese had 
settled once and for all the argu- 
ment about an unchangeable 
national character. There was no 
such thing.) 

Americans operated the great in- 
dustrial plant — for it remained 
great even after the disorders of 
l999-2()()0. I'hey farmed, raised 
cattle, moved goods, educated, 
comnumicted, and entertained 
themselves. But Harmony was not a 
world power, as the U.S. had been. 
Its financial and military tentacles 
were withdrawn and folded in a 
prim, clean lap. The striving, 
hustling, bustling spirit had gone 
out of Americans. All that they pro- 



32 



GALAXY 




moted now was the Confinements. 
Was that a clue? Had America 
withdrawn into itself to nurture a 
new creation? Or was it caught in 
the grip of a fatal disease? Was 
American placidity a kind of 
grand, national guilt? 

The car slowed down. Abruptly 
(hey were out of the holographic 
ghost town. The geometric unifor- 
mity of the real Manhattan lay be- 
liind. The scene resolved into an 
ancient neighborhood of half-ruin- 
ed brick buildings, dark in silhou- 
ette against the barrier’s shimmer. 
The road ahead had narrowed, and 
in the headlights of the vehicle 
Schmidt saw the huge buckled con- 
crete slabs of an impassable street. 

“We go on foot from here.” The 
ear door opened and a light came 
on in the cab of the van. Gilligan 
held the door. “You’re absolutely 
sale,” he said. Sehmidt groaned a 
little as he got out. Ancient bones. 
“We’ve got this whole place staked 
out w ith men.” Gilligan gestured in 
a wide eirele w ith an electric torch 
Schmidt hadn’t seen him activate. 

Schmidt stretched. He was still 
tired, despite the good snooze on 
the plane and a nap in the aseptic 
hotel room. The barrier was very 
near. It niiieh resembled a rain- 
bow, but it was a dome of a rain- 
bow, not merely a strip. Tiny fire- 
llies of current pulsed amidst the 
colors. It was beautiful in a way. 

He j'ollowed the eirele of Gilli- 
gan’s light on the broken pave- 
ment. and they walked into the 



darkness of brick. 

How the barrier was generated, 
the cost of generation, how deep it 
extended underground, and how 
high into the sky — all that had been 
in the brochures. They knew all 
about the deletenious gynomax ex- 
pansion but nothing about the 
l.ady of the Expansion. 

The abandoned old-fashioned 
buildings turned out to be part of a 
buffer zone between the barrier and 
the rest of the city. In a moment 
they were through it and emerged 
into a no man’s land. Gilligan 
hesitated — then moved to his left in 
a diagonal line across the razed ter- 
rain. In the jerkily moving ball of 
light. Schmidt saw bits of broken 
brick pressed into the clay, pieces 
of reinforcing bars dark with rust, 
and other litter. He had a wry 
thought. All this was a bit below 
par for the famous tidiness of New 
Harmony. Immediately up ahead 
(he barrier seemed to rise right out 
of the grourid. 

Suddenly Schmidt stopped. 

“Hold it a minute, Mr. Gilligan!” 

Gilligan turned and his light 
turned with him on the ground. 

Schmidt gestured. “Who’re 

they?” 

The light moved and picked out 
a girl on the edge of the desolate, 
barren terrain. She stood near a 
brownstone that had been cut in 
hair by the giant bulldozer that 
must have cleared this strip of land. 
Behind her a bathtub hung like a 
whitish blob inside the shell of the 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



33 




building by a pipe. The girl stood 
very erect, very still. Her blond hair 
fell straight down. She wore a 
simple skirt and blouse. Neatly 
neo-puritan. Beyond her stood an- 
other girl in the same attitude, and 
beyond her yet another, and so on 
until the desolation curved away 
out of sight. 

Schmidt looked at Gilligan who 
hadn’t replied. The young man 
fidgeted in obvious discomfort. 

“Well?” 

Gilligan hesitated, unsure of 
himself. Like every other official of 
the New Puritan Secular Order, he 
was an avid student of the Har- 
monizer’s writings, but he didn’t 
fully understand the doctrine of dif- 
ferential moral pressure that people 
used to explain the Vigil. To Gilli- 
gan the Vigil had always seemed a 
straightforward protest movement 
that should be put down without 
much ado, and that’s how his 
superiors would behave, he 
thought, if they were free to act. 
But somehow a protest movement 
was not compatible with the doc- 
trine of differential moral pressure. 
Anyway. Gilligan was confused. 

“Girls,” he said lamely, unable 
to delay any longer. “Just some 
girls.” 

.Schmidt raised his eyebrows at 
the evasive reply. Girls they were, 
so much was established; but he 
didn’t need Gilligan to tell him 
that. This was one hell of a lot more 
than girls. This was a formation of 
girls, fhe girls stood spaced out at 



five meter intervals. All stood in the 
same odd, almost reverent pose, 
Schmidt said: 

“Surely that can’t be all? Come 
on. Hank. You have such nice ini- 
tials for everything that I don’t 
understand. Tell me what the 
letters are.” 

Gilligan smiled painfully. 
“That’s the VOP,” he said. He 
added: “If you must know.” When 
Schmidt raised his eyebrows again, 
he went a step further: “The Vigil 
of Protest.” 

“Oh? 1 thought you people lived 
in harmony. All the malcontents 
are supposed to be behind that 
thing.” Schmidt gestured at fire- 
llies in a sea of color. 

Inwardly Schmidt was pleased. 
Maybe the America he knew and 
loved hadn’t died altogether. There 
was some hope. 

Gilligan squirmed. “It’s the Con- 
stitution,” he said. He paused, 
struggling to find the right expres- 
sion. “Oh, gee, it’s complicated. 
You see, Karl, they’re not 
organized. They never speak. They 
come alone: they leave alone. 

We’ve got agents tracking the lot, 
but wc’vc never been able to prove 
conspiracy. So it’s not a protest 
under the Constitution.” Pause. 
“God know s why they do it . Of 
course we have a theory.” 

“Differential moral pressure? 
Unidentified co- vibrators?” 

“Oh. you’ve been told.” 

“Lnough to understand, alto- 
gether enough,” Schmidt said. “Of 



34 



GALAXY 




course no one bothered to tell me 
about the . VOP. Why do they 
call it the Vigil of Protest?” 

''They don’t call it anything. 
They ]\xs\ come and stand here. The 
people call it that. It’s just a phrase 
that’s got about. We’d better be go- 
ing, Karl.” 

“Just a minute,” Schmidt said. 
“How long has this been going 
on ' 

“As long as I can remember. I 
guess ever since the barrier went 
up. That’d be seven years.” 

“So not all the people support 
the Confinement — on the Outside, 
(liat is.” 

“1 wouldn’t say that,” Gilligan 
protested. “Not a bit. Like you 
said, they’re co-vibrators. They are 
attracted to the baseness.” Gilligan 
gestured toward the barrier. “They 
rightfully belong in there. Could we 
go? This is the time they always 
start coming through. 1 don’t want 
(o miss the action.” 

Schmidt hesitated, but then he 
gave up, nodded, and followed 
(jilligan’s light once more toward 
an unmarked hole in the middle of 
the razed terrain. Once it must 
have been the entrance to the sub- 
ways that no longer ran. 

I'hey went down and then, led by 
CJilligan’s light, they walked along 
abandoned corridors amidst cob- 
webs and litter to a small room 
crowded with equipment. Two 
lounging detectives rose and were 
introduced. Then Gilligan pointed 
to a large screen set against the 



wall. It showed the sparkling light 
of the barrier edged on two sides by 
what looked like a broken wall. 
They sat down to wait for a chief. 

T he chief w as a long time in com- 
ing. At the moment he — that is 
to say Emmanuel Toronto Salazar 
Smith — sat on a rock in a cavelike 
enclosure w ith his hands around his 
face. He sat on a white handker- 
chief that he had spread out to pro- 
tect his suit. From time to time he 
glanced up at the shimmering 
barrier that filled the cave with dim 
light. He glanced especially at the 
fireflies in the color, measuring 
their intensity. 

On two successive earlier tries, 
he had found the Fire too hot. 
Three chiefs had gone ahead of 
him, and it being the peculiarity of 
the Fire to intensify when someone 
passed through it, Manny-Man had 
had to wait. Now he still waited, 
guessing that in another hour or so 
he might chance it again. 

He smoked his last cigarette like 
a man condemned. He carefully 
smoothed the empty package and 
put it in his pocket. Then he waited 
without even that consolation. 

On the other side of the barrier, 
in the small observation room, the 
two detectives, accustomed now to 
the presence of the foreign visitor 
and bored by the absence of action 
on the flickering screen, resumed 
the argument .Schmidt’s entrance 
had interrupted. They discussed 
the Flood. 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



35 




One maintained that the Flood 
had come because Ralph Waldo 
had prayed for Divine vengeance 
seeing that the Nation disregarded 
his counsel. Furthermore, the 
things that had gone on in Califor- 
nia! The Devil himself had lived in 
California and had feasted his nos- 
trils on the smoke of hippies and 
cats and children sacrificed by 
cultists on the beaches over fires of 
driftwood. It was no surprise to the 
detective that God should listen to 
Ralph’s entreaties. He himself had 
known something would happen 
just from reading his Bible. 

The second one called the first a 
superstitious fool whose blabber- 
ings were a blasphemy and de- 
graded the Great Mental Scientist. 
He wouldn’t sit by and let any man 
make a petty tribal god out of 
Ralph Waldo. Ralph was the ulti- 
mate modern man — a man who’d 
learned the law s both of Matter and 
Spirit. 

If this detective’s opinion 
counted for anything, it was that 
Ralph had foreseen the Flood by 
searching the Future with his Third 
F.ye, the one the Hindoos said was 
right in the center of your forehead 
and o]iened when you lived a 
strictly scientific life. As for the 
Bible, in his humble opinion, it was 
a corruption of something once 
valuable, but lor all practical pur- 
poses. it was as good as useless 
now . 

As this argument grew heated, 
Cfilligan became slightly embar- 



rassed and tried to engage Schmidt 
in a competing conversation. But 
Schmidt waved him away. He said 
this was a most interesting and en- 
lightening discussion. Hearing this, 
the detectives launched into ever 
greater flights of eloquence. 

rhus time passed. 

At last, in his cave, Manny-Man 
rose from his rock. He thought he 
detected a thinning of sparkles in 
the color, and when he tested the 
Fire w ith a finger, he found that it 
had lessened its bite. 

The third try would succeed, he 
decided. Three was the Lady’s 
sacred number. This time he’d 
make it all the w ay through and not 
recoil from the suffocating nausea 
and the searing, paralyzing pain. 

He took a deep breath. 

His lear had become so intense 
that his bod no longer felt it. Sweat 
beads stood on his forehead and 
over his lip. He moved forward, but 
his feet were rooted in the clay dirt 
of the ground. He stared down and 
saw bits of old tile that had paved 
this area. 

“Please,” he w hispered. “Please, 
l.ady, be with me, let me go, let it 
be over, please release me.” 

The lady denied his request. In- 
stead she made him think compul- 
sively about the passage back which 
was also still before him. He’d have 
to make it carrying a girl in his 
arms. And he remembered Betty 
Simple as they’d passed through 
coming the other way — not at this 
breach but at another. She had 



36 



GALAXY 




screamed in the middle of the hell 
ol Fire. And he’d stared at her face, 
licr open mouth, her terrified eyes. 
And Fire had clung to her lips and 
longue and teeth. Her brows and 
liair and eyes had flamed. And he’d 
almost fainted with the fear of 
Strangeness that had overcome his 
hod fear. 

“Be with me. Lady,’’ he whis- 
pered again. 

He gave himself a little nudge 
forward, and this time his body 
obeyed him. He eased himself into 
I lie brilliant hell slowly, shoulder 
llrsl, his face torn by a grimace. 
( entimeter by centimeter he 
merged with the barrier and be- 
came a dark shape within its bril- 
liance. 

Schmidt saw the figure first and 
called attention to it. It was a dark 
luimanoid shadow in the light. It 
came very slowly. Then at last 
Manny-Man broke out of the bar- 
rier, doubled over, swayed, and fell 
over like someone dead. He jerked 
involuntarily. Spasms passed over 
his half-bent form. Whisps of elec- 
Iromagnetic energy played over the 
exposed surface of his skin like 
names. Then the radiation died 
down to a shimmer on hands and 
face. Finally even the shimmer 
faded away. 

“Peacefreak,” Gilligan said, and 
the disputatious detectives nodded. 
“That’s our man.” Gilligan was 
tense with excitement. “The yellow 
tie,” he added with a glance at 
Schmidt. 



Schmidt marveled. The form on 
the ground testified to the excru- 
ciating agonies the slow passage 
must cause. Why did they do it? 
Surely only the deepest and most 
fundamental human motivation 
could induce a man to go through 
such torture. 

Gilligan walked to a radio and 
called for someone he dubbed 
Dragnet Five. He told the man they 
had a “live one.” He gave instruc- 
tions and emphasized that no 
action be taken until the subject 
had committed an act of force. 
“We’ve got to have an honest to 
goodness V-P pair,” he concluded. 
“You know those chicks. They 
know the Constitution. We’ve got 
to get them dead to rights.” Drag- 
net Five said that he understood. 

Gilligan then turned to Schmidt. 
“It’s all set. This should be clean as 
a whistle.” He pointed to the screen 
where the Peacefreak still spasmed 
on the ground. “He’ll come to in 
about twenty minutes. Then he’ll 
clean himself. They believe they 
must be spic-and-span to go unde- 
tected. They always pick a nice 
clean spot on this side. I’ll give you 
odds that he’ll go under the strip 
and come up in the brick. Then 
he’ll snatch himself a VOP chick. 
I’d guess. He’ll drag her back into 
the ruins. When he gets her into the 
shadow's, we’ll move in.” 

Gilligan was all serious concen- 
tration, all cop. He rubbed his 
hands. 

“And then?” Schmidt asked. 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT 



37 




“And then we’ll vipple the pair.” 
Ill 

T he girl waited to be snatched. 

Her name was Timmy Mc- 
Callum, but in the Vigil they called 
her Rubeegol, which was the 
brandname of a lipstick. She also 
thought of herself as Rubeegol. She 
had left her old life behind. 

Everyone in the Visible Vigil had 
a code name, the necessary condi- 
tion for surreptitious communica- 
tions by telephone and letter. Com- 
munications were essential, for the 
Vigil orchestrated a widespread 
national protest — and what it had 
become, the Expansion Plot. So the 
girls had code names, and the girl- 
ish chit-chat about nailpolishes, 
deodorants, depilatories, creams, 
ointments, unguents, and powders 
wasn’t what it seemed. 

But it was more complicated 
than that. 

No member of the VV ever spoke 
to any other member, but they 
communicated nevertheless, using 
intermediaries, never fewer than 
three. The go-betweens were 
members of the Invisible Vigil. 
These girls never went near the 
forty-seven Confinements of New 
Harmony. 

Rubeegol came from the upper 
class. Her father belonged to the 
new aristocracy that had arisen 
with NPSO. He was Internal 
Crusade Representative for Allied 
Donsanto International, one of two 



chemical giants in the country with 
headquarters in flood-safe St. 
Louis in Mokan Harmony. Rubee- 
gol grew up in California. She took 
part in the East Rush when, 
following the earliest California 
tremors in February 1999, a third 
of the state’s population (later 
called The Remnant) had literally 
climbed the Rocky Mountains and 
had thus escaped both the earth- 
quakes and the Flood. Her father 
had been a space engineer in 
charge of a thousand people en- 
gaged in the formulation of nose- 
cone coatings, and thus he had the 
management experience required 
for organizing one of the sixteen 
Remnant “Salients” that had 
fanned out all over the land east of 
the Rockies to generate the popular 
uprising in favor of Gunnison. 

Through the first years of the Re- 
newal, Rubeegol had been an 
ardent Puritan, working as a nurse 
in the Civil Disturbance. When 
things settled down, she resumed 
her interrupted studies, and since 
there was no longer a UCLA, she 
went to Eastcoast. Here she wit- 
nessed establishment of the first 
Confinement, and she was one of 
the first girls in her class to join the 
Women’s Protest which over time 
grew into the Vigil. 

Rubeegol served IV for nearly 
four years. She recruited eighty 
girls at last, and as a reward she 
was allowed to “take off her make- 
up,” as they said in the Movement. 
She turned visible. She got her 



38 



GALAXY 




chance to enter Lady-service inside 
(he barrier. 

This was her three hundredth 
(lay of vigil. With days off and vaca- 
tions counted in, that made nearly 
a year and a half of waiting — time 
enough to grow impatient, time 
enough to wonder if she’d ever be 
snatched. 

Yet tonight she had a light heart, 
beneath the hard-nosed militancy 
(hat came with the acceptance of 
Vigil discipline, Rubeegol remained 
a woman. She didn’t totally avoid 
(he pervasive anti-fern propaganda 
which said — in effect — that women 
were different: more sentimental, a 
little light headed, warmer of heart, 
iingifted in technology, and intui- 
(ive rather than brainy. She knew 
all this for the pure bosh it was. 
Rubeegol knew all about women 
and what they could do. 

In a period of less than seven 
years, a handful of women (many of 
(hem active Puritans during the Re- 
newal) had infiltrated the Confine- 
ments and established the Lady- 
eiilt. It had started as a collective 
effort, as a political tactic, a way to 
give cohesion and hope to the 
wretches in those unspeakable, 
bounded slums. But the Cult had 
developed a spirit and meaning of 
i(s ow n. The rituals devised to man- 
age the masses had begun to act on 
(he originators, and now the Cult 
was something more. The bits and 
pieces of poetry and scripture taken 
almost at random from hundreds of 
sources and Xeroxed crudely to 



make a Holy Book had linked like 
fibers into a real Scripture with an 
oddly cohesive logic of its own. The 
concept of a stern yet benevolent 
Lady — simultaneously Bride, 
Mother, and Ancient Crone — now 
seemed real and vibrant with life. 
Taboos imposed merely to create 
an air of mystery turned out now to 
have inherent value. (One of these 
was the sanctity of metals of all 
kinds, and the command to save 
them.) Disciplines extracted to 
create order had created high 
morale. (One of these was the re- 
quirement that chiefs undergo the 
Ordeal of Fire to get a queen and 
hence to merit their positions of 
leadership.) Oracular pronounce- 
ments by pack and tribal queens 
became of necessity real oracles. 
And the sacramental fornications 
on Janenights — chosen as a central 
rite because nothing less would 
have captured the attention of the 
debased population — had become 
charged with symbolic significance. 
The Lady became the Cosmos, the 
Ecosphere, the Mild Adaptation, 
the Circle of Peace, the Song of 
Heaven, the Merciful, the Bond of 
Service. Her robe was the sky and 
her undergarments the rainbow, 
and the barrier itself the shelter of 
her skirts. 

In the Lady’s name — and later in 
Her service — women worked to free 
the confined populations using any 
and all tools they could, including 
technical tools. Rubeegol stood on 
the edge of the razed terrain in

shoes between whose soles cad- 
mium flakes had been hidden, 
•They would make solar panels, and 
the panels would power the under- 
ground factories. Her clothing was 
laced with other metals and fibers 
needed to make neutralizers. Pro- 
gress was slow, but the first factory, 
the one beneath Sophia Grande in 
Eastcoast, already produced such 
devices. They couldn’t be used yet. 
The authorities could detect neu- 
tralizer breaches. But they were 
being produced, and some day they 
would be used. 

Rubeegol was all too conscious of 
the fact that women had organized 
the metals smuggling, by-passing 
the detectors at the official gates 
through the device — and the discip- 
line — of Queen Raids. Women had 
engineered the logistical system 
Outside as well as the production 
system within. Women had solved 
the complex problems presented by 
an environment so primitive the 
common people burned fecal waste 
to cook their meals. 

Women. Yes, women had done 
all that, a signal achievement. The 
Confinement had helped, of 
course. The psychic pressures 
generated by a population expand- 
ing against a barrier had prepared 
the folk for religious conversion. 
The brutal competition for food 
had created a longing for unity and 
peace — and the Lady-cult supplied 
a kind of central union even as it 
pardoned and sanctioned the 
reality of vicious foodwar that it 



couldn’t stop. Better that some live 
well than that all starve and Con- 
finement become a graveyard of 
men and women without flesh on 
their bones. Meanwhile in every 
oracle every queen urged the people 
to make the Realm green. 

Women. She was proud to be a 
woman. 

Nevertheless, Rubeegol accepted 
from the Harmony propaganda 
what it pleased her to accept. She 
was superstitious when it pleased 
her, and she was more intuitive 
than men, when it pleased her. 
After all, she was a woman, and it 
was the ancient privilege of women 
to do what they pleased. She knew 
this in her bones. 

Tonight it pleased her to have an 
intuition. She would be snatched. 
She knew it. It also pleased her to 
be superstitious. She felt she had 
received too omens. This was the 
three hundredth day of her vigil, 
and the number three was sacred to 
the Lady. The second omen had 
been a flashlight beam pointed in 
her direction by two men who’d 
stood in the darkness and had then 
disappeared down the subway en- 
trance. The light had picked her 
out. Why her? Why not one of the 
other vigilantes? Rubeegol felt sure 
it was a sign. 

She thought about that, and she 
thought about life inside the 
Realm, the year she’d spend inside 
a cage hung up in a church or 
chapel, the Janenights she’d an- 
nounce whenever it pleased her.

and then the work in Sophia 
(jrande on the great plot to break 
out of the bubbles and overrun the 
land. 

Her mind wandered off into the 
future and ranged over the past. 
She exulted in the thought that hu- 
manity would once again be reunit- 
ed in America. The narrow, crabby 
aberration of a time would be swept 
away. But then she brought her 
mind back to her intuition, growing 
lldgety and nervous again. Her 
(ime was nearly up. She’d have to 
leave soon and then, after a 
measured interval, as if it had 
liappened at random, another girl 
would take her place. 

But no, she thought, that won’t 
he. Tonight is the night. 

It was in the air about her. She 
telt a sense of expectation. 

Or was it just that the squeeze 
were thicker than usual? In that 
ruin to her left she’d seen the glow 
of a cigarette. Earlier she’d heard 
(he upsurge and abrupt cut-off of a 
transistor radio — as if someone’s 
Unger had slipped on the volume 
dial. They were out in force to- 
night. 

Well, she thought, they can’t do 
anything to me. 

Is it that that I’m sensing? she 
wondered, momentarily worried. 
All those cops? 

No, she assured herself. It’s real. 
I’ll be snatched tonight. 

The police were remarkably well 
disciplined, by and large. Neverthe- 
less Rubeegol had heard of girls 




What a banner month September Is 
for the science-fiction side of the house! 
Leading our mass-market list — breaking 
out of the category and heading straight 
for the bestseller lists — is RENDEZ- 
VOUS WITH RAMA, Arthur C. 
Clarke’s smashing new novel! Backed by 
publicity, promotion and all the atten- 
dant fanfare reserved for mainstream 
bestsellers, RAMA is sure to set records 
for sf sales, perhaps even surpassing 
CHILDHOOD’S END. If that’s possible! 
RAMA has been reviewed in all the 
major media — not least TIME MAGA- 
ZINE: ^‘The probability that a vast 
superior intelligence would be totaUy in- 
different to man and his doings is indeed 
what Clarke is writing about.” It’s al- 
ready won the Nebula and John W. 
Campbell Award . and we’re betting 
on its taking the ‘’triple crown!” 

If we had to nominate a cover as the 
best science- fiction cover of this [or any 
other) year, we’d opt for the Dean Ellis 
extravaganza that packages RAMA . 
but, of course, we are totally impartial. 
Each year Ellis contributes several of the 
most imaginative and best executed 
covers in the business — not only are they 
beautiful, but they sell books. Strangely, 
his name never appears on Hugo 
ballots . perhaps because his work is 
concentrated in the book field, and only 
exposure in sf magazines keeps an 
artist’s name before the fans. Pity! Think 
about it . 



A year and something ago we read 
quite an off-beat yam in Galaxy: “A 
Voice and Bitter Weeping.” You may 
remember it — a delightful tale of some 
Israeli mercenaries who find themselves 
embroiled in a war between Texas and 
the United States. A novel idea, we 
thought! Indeed, enough ideas floating 
around to make a novel . and so we

long-distanced the chaps responsible in 
Texas and asked for more — 55,000 
words more to be exact. 

And so, a year later, we offer The 
Texas-Israeli War? 1999, by Jake 
Saunders and Howard Waldrop. Rebel- 
lious Texans have kidnapped the Presi- 
dent of the United STates and are hold- 
ing him captive in Crystal City. His 
future— and indeed the future of the 
country — depends on a band of fearless 
Israelis whose courage has been tested in 
other wars! Sol Inglestein Is the delicious 
hero, and we nominate Alan — Alda or 
Arkin — to play the lead, when Holly- 
wood discovers this fast-paced and de- 
lightfully exciting sf adventure. 



Finding science-flction short stories to 
publish is easy. Everybody’s a writer— or 
at least everybody thinks he’s a writer. 
Finding good short stories to publish is 
quite another matter. Nonetheless, we’ve 
thrown our editorial hat into the original- 
anthology ring and are introducing 
STELLAR 1, all new stories written by: 
Clement, Dickson, Foster, Lafferty, 
Niven, Rothman, Silververg, Simak and 
Vinge. 

The editor of this splendid new series 
is Judy-Lynn del Rey, who learned ail 
about science fiction in the eight years 
she was Managing Editor of Galaxy and 
IF. Now she is Ballantine’s sf editor and 
writes most of these columns . she is 
also related to Lester del Rey by mar- 
riage. 



And last, but never least, we offer 
STAR TREK LOG TWO, adaptations 
of everybody’s favorite phenomenon 
written by Alan Dean Foster. Gene 
Roddenberry called from California the 
other day to rave about LOG ONE . 
*‘that Foster has really brought those 
characters to life . can hardly wait for 
the next one.” Well, here it is, on sale 
everywhere; and LOG THREE will 
follow in January. BB 



who’d been dragged off into the 
ruins by squeeze for a bit of forcible 
bushwack. She imagined a dirty old 
mattress, a heavy pressing body, 
hard breathing. 

She shook off the feeling. It had 
never happened to her, but it was 
the kind of thing a vigilante was 
supposed to take in her stride. You 
couldn’t be sexually selective in this 
job. You’d be the mate of whatever 
chief snatched you, even if he 
turned out to be Frankenstein him- 
self. 

Time passed. 

Rubeegol watched the play of fire 
in the barrier. An airplane flew by 
overhead. She grew sluggish and 
despondent. And when the feet dis- 
lodged a brick behind her in the 
ruin, she mistook the sound for the 
scamper of a rat. The man caught 
her totally by surprise. His final 
rush came too quickly to elicit any- 
thing resembling a reaction from 
her. The hand enveloped her 
mouth and crushed her nose. She 
gulped for air. A knee bruised the 
small of her back. Her hands 
fought frantically for balance as he 
pulled her back. Then she saw an 
explosion of stars. The pain rushed 
in just as her consciousness fled, 

S HE came awake in a speeding 
car. She opened her eyes for a 
second and immediately closed 
them again. One glimpse told her 
that she was in a police van. She lay 
on a cot. Peripherally she’d sensed 
another figure next to her, and at 



42 



GALAXY 




the foot of the cot had squatted a 
police technician in a white shirt. 
She’d recognized the gold-rimmed 
cap. In the wide front seat she’d 
seen two men next to a driver in a 
chauffeur’s uniform. 

The tactic of camouflage reward- 
ed her with information. The men 
in the front conversed, and she 
could hear them fairly well despite 
the rush of tires on the pavement. 

“Mind you,’’ one voice said — it 
was bright, young and eager. “We 
don’t know for sure that it’ll work, 
hut our psychologists swear it’ll in- 
capacitate the man.’’ 

“By the expansion of his con- 
sciousness. I was told that; over 
dinner.’’ The voice of an older 
man. Rubeegol detected an accent. 

Silence. The wheels whizzed over 
pavement. 

Rubeegol felt a dull ache on the 
side of her head, a throbbing. But 
she pushed that aside. She was 
thinking hard. She added one and 
one together. She had been snatch- 
ed. In the moment before some 
hard object had exploded against 
her head, she’d known her attacker 
as a chief. By the smell. Not a cop, 
a chief. The pungent odor still 
hung in the car. It conjured up a 
llash-niemory of her uncle’s farm. 
Men coming in from the hunt 
brought in that earthy odor, that 
redolence of animality. The figure 
she sensed next to herself must be a 
chief and her attacker. 

Adjustment operation, she 
thought with irritation. Clumsy at- 



tempt to influence the internal poli- 
tics of the Confinement. It irritated 
Rubeegol because it meant a delay 
in her entry, nothing more. They 
would lecture the chief and, if it 
pleased them, they’d include her 
also under the ‘victim’ rubric of the 
law . At most they could carry on for 
twenty-three hours and fifty-nine 
minutes. Thereafter it was deten- 
tion, and that was unconstitutional. 
Then they’d be released or placed 
inside EC. She preferred release. If 
she was pushed through the metal 
detectors at the official entry point, 
she would lose the precious cargo 
she carried. 

Up front the older man spoke; 
“You’ve assured me that it’s legal, 
but I’ve been thinking. In Berlin 
we’d call it an invasion of privacy. 
Isn’t that illegal here?’’ A foreign- 
er, hence the accent. 

“Not if it’s mutual,’’ the young 
voice said. “The Celestial Arbiters 
found that an exchange of privacies 
was not covered.’’ 

Rubeegol was puzzled. What on 
earth were they talking about now. 
An exchange of privacies? It sound- 
ed menacing, somehow. 

“Doesn’t that come to the same 
thing?’’ Berlin asked. “It hurts 
them both, doesn’t it? And even if 
we assume that the perpetrator de- 
serves what he gets — what about 
the victim? Those failure rates you 
cited earlier don’t sound encour- 
aging. Not for mice or rats or ham- 
sters or guinea pigs; certainly not 
for people. You’re exposing an 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

innocent victim to the risk of 
schizophrenia. High risk, if your 
numbers are correct.” 

“Innocent?” 

“Of course. The victim’s inno- 
cent, of course.” 

“We have a slightly different 
conception here,” the young voice 
said. “We make no differentia- 
tion.” 

Now Rubeegol understood a part 
of what they were talking about. 
Ralphy’s Science of Morals, she 
thought. The victim invites the 
crime. Nothing ever happens by ac- 
cident. If you get robbed, you want 
to get robbed. The Mind reaches 
out and grabs hold of Substance. 
Substance manifests in Phenom- 
ena. She thought of the ideological 
indoctrination she’d undergone 
during the Renewal and later in 
college. It had all made marvelous 
sense at one time. 

The older man said: “I had for- 
gotten. That is your penological 
doctrine. That falls under the 
rubric of co-vibration, right? But 
I’d understood that you don’t carry 
that principle into practice. Say a 
high official of NPSO is attacked, 
what then?” 

Rubeegol began to like the old 
man. 

The youngster answered: “As a 
rule we don’t enforce that pro- 
vision, and there is the exception 
clause where a victim can show that 
professional or scientific involve- 
ment with crime may have been the 
cause of the attack. But the point 



is, Karl, that we’re legally covered. 
That’s why we don’t hesitate to 
vipple the girl. Legally she’s as 
guilty as the man.” 

“Mr. Gilligan, I—” 

But Rubeegol didn’t hear what 
the older man said. The car ran 
over a ribbed surface now and tires 
hummed at a high pitch. She recog- 
nized the place by the sound. Good 
old familiar Police Compound. It 
was like home. They dragged you 
off to the Compound once a month 
at least for interrogation. They 
were on West Side near Seventh 
Avenue and Thirty-Third Street. 

The phrase rang through her 
mind. Vipple the girl. Vipple? 
Rubeegol began to feel strong 
apprehensions and judged it high 
time to come awake officially. She 
opened her eyes and looked about, 
sat up. There was a chief beside 
her, a handsome, dark brute of a 
man — not Frankenstein, thank 
God. Her movement appeared to 
trigger motion in the technician 
who squatted at the foot of her cot. 
He reached down into a narrow 
black case between his legs. 

“Where am 1? What is this? 
Where are you taking me?” 

She spoke calmly knowing the 
rules of the game. At her words the 
two men in the front seat immedi- 
ately turned and the chauffeur 
glanced over his shoulder briefly. 
She saw an expression of sympathy 
in the grey eyes of the older man, 
but the young one looked stern. He 
said: 



44 



GALAXY 




“Calm yourself, chicky. Just 
don’t get hysterical right away.” 
“I’m not a bit hysterical. 1 just 
want to know where you’re taking 

f * 

me. 

The young man turned to the 
technician who still fumbled with 
something between his knees. 
“Messerschmidt, you better give 
her a sedative. She’s overwrought.” 
“Now just a minute,” Rubeegol 
cried, but she saw that it would do 
no good to argue. The technician 
had risen to a crouching position 
and approached her with an 
injector in his hand. His round cap 
almost brushed the roof of the van 
and he swayed with the motion of 
the vehicle. She struggled briefly 
when he bent over her, but the gun 
soon touched her arm at one point, 
and for the second time within a 
short span she felt the outrush of 
awareness. 

T he VPLE laboratory’s action 
component was a room divided 
in the center by a pane of glass. 
One side contained two elaborate 
devices that reminded Schmidt of 
dentist’s chairs. An impressive con- 
sole stood between them. Wires ran 
from the console to instrument 
arms above each chair. On the 
other side of the glass were arm- 
chairs, couches, a coffee table, and 
other furniture reminescent of a 
doctor’s waiting room. 

Dr. Fieldgreen, a little man in a 
white coat and sporting a goatee, 
stood by the glass with Schmidt on 



the couch side. Gilligan leaned over 
the coffee table behind them and 
leafed through a magazine. Beyond 
the glass, lab technicians prepared 
the V-P pair. Both the girl and the 
dark man were unconscious, and 
the technicians strapped them into 
the chair now. 

Dr. Fieldgreen apologized for the 
seeming simplicity of the set-up. He 
had a calm, precise delivery. 
“There is much, much more to 
VPLE than you see here,” he as- 
sured Schmidt. “Our computer 
facilities are on the floor below, and 
the signal modulators occupy sixty 
cubic meters on the floor above.” 
He pointed a finger at the white 
cork of the sound-proofed ceiling. 
“The rest of this floor is office 
space, labs, and the animal test 
areas, of course. Our annual 
budget is eighty-five million 
dollars, but of course we spend 
most of that in outside contracts on 
component work. You see, Herr 
Schmidt, we are still looking for 
improvements. This process takes 
almost eight hours, which is unac- 
ceptable, totally unacceptable.” 
Dr. Fieldgreen frowned and shook 
his head to underline his words. 

“How do you monitor the pro- 
cess,” Schmidt asked. He had been 
toying with an idea he didn’t care to 
share with anyone just yet. 

“Through instruments,” the 
doctor said. “I failed to mention 
that, but we have a recording room 
next door where the wave patterns 
are graphed.” 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

“I meant,” Schmidt pursued a 
little guardedly, “I meant human 
monitoring. Can’t you ... I guess 
I’d imagined that you could ‘listen 
in’ on the exchange between two 
people. Human monitoring . .” 
The little man shook his head 
slowly but persistently. ‘‘No, no,” 
he said. ‘‘No, no, Herr Schmidt.” 
He lifted a finger. “First, it’s highly 
dangerous. The danger of schizoid 
reaction is pronounced. In that 
area we are also expending some re- 
sources, as you can imagine. 
Second,” and he added another 
finger, “there’s what we call the 
Heisenberg effect. You see, Herr 
Schmidt, you can’t monitor without 
participation, and so the monitor- 
ing itself would tend to interfere 
with the process. Third — ” 

“Excuse me. Doctor. I didn’t 
understand you completely. You 
mean to say you don’t know what is 
exchanged between the people?” 
“Of course we do. Their life ex- 
perience.” Dr. Fieldgreen pointed 
to the couple in the dentist chairs. 
Technicians were fitting loose nets 
of wire over the man’s head. "'His 
experience will become her experi- 
ence, and her memories, feelings, 
etc., will become his memories and 
so forth.” 

“Do you mean that he’ll lose his 
memories and get hers?” Schmidt 
asked incredulously. 

“No, no. Each will retain his or 
her memories as well. The process 
is additive.” 

“Hmm,” Schmidt said, think- 



ing, “But as for substance, the con- 
tent of those memories. Do you 
monitor . .” 

“We have no way of monitoring 
that — unless, of course, we were to 
subject ourselves to VPLE, which is 
ridiculous.” 

“Then how do you know what 
takes place?” 

“Through animal tests.” 

“But how can you be sure? One 
animal picks up what another 
animal has learned?” 

“Exactly. After VPLE, each has 
the other’s behavioral repertoire.” 
Schmidt shook his head in 
wonder. If it was true, if it really 
worked, this device could fantasti- 
cally magnify human powers. 
“Third,” Dr. Fieldgreen said. 
Schmidt looked at him in puzzle- 
ment. Then he saw the three fingers 
in the air. 

“One more question. Dr. Field- 
green, before you go on to your 
third point. Dr. Fieldgreen, has it 
occurred to you that VPLE might 
create a superman?” 

The doctor nodded. “It has. But 
we don’t think it wdll. It hasn’t 
created a supermouse or a superrat 
at this point. As a matter of fact, 
the tendency is in the other direc- 
tion. Vippled laboratory animals 
tend as a whole to underperform in 
the maze. We have a theory about 
that. We eall it the Field Capacity 
Syndrome. We assume, and I think 
rightly, that the brain can only ab- 
sorb and hold so much informa- 
tion — what w'e call field capacity.

GALAXY 




And if it’s overloaded, you get a 
leaching effect. The additional in- 
put seeps away. That seems to be 
(he actual situation. Two sets of ex- 
perience get mixed up, but only a 
portion of each remains, and conse- 
quently the subject loses mental co- 
ordination. At least that was the 
obvious result with Abe Herzenberg 
Sultzy Chico Kid.” 

Abe Herzenberg Sultzy Chico 
Kid. Superrats and supermice. 
Mental leachate dripping through 
the psychic ether. A strange world, 
Karl Schmidt thought, which made 
mice and rats the model for Man 
assuming no discontinuity in the 
spectrum of life between rodent 
and poet. Maybe there was no 
sharp and obvious break. Maybe 
man was nothing more than a 
superrat . 

“Third,” Dr. Fieldgreen said. 

Schmidt gave the persistent 
doctor a glance. “Oh. Of course. 
Third, Dr. Fieldgreen.” 

“Third,” said the doctor, “we 
wouldn’t monitor even if we could. 
That would be an illegal invasion of 
privacy.” 

“Why. of course,” Schmidt said. 
“I’d forgotten about that.” 

D r fieldgreen threw the 
switch shortly after midnight. 
The instrument panel on the con- 
sole between the chairs came alive 
in multichromatic splendor. In the 
chairs the man and girl seemed un- 
aware that anything had trans- 
pired. They sat strapped in, asleep 



or comatose, their faces even and 
peaceful as if they were dreaming. 
Each had a netting draped about 
the head with wires extending from 
the netting to the instrument arm 
and from there to the console. 
Furthermore, Schmidt understood 
that the impulse from her chair 
passed, through the console, into 
the signal modulator banks on the 
floor above; and from there, pre- 
sumably modulated, to the com- 
puter banks on the floor below; and 
from there, appropriately digitaliz- 
ed, into the console; and from 
there, through the cables, to his 
chair. And vice versa. 

Schmidt watched, wondering if 
he would have a chance to do the 
foolish thing he had decided to do. 

The large group that had as- 
sembled soon dispersed again. 
There was nothing to see, no 
drama, no action. Nevertheless, 
Schmidt continued standing before 
the glass, his arms folded in front, 
his eyes on the couple. He was 
aware that his continued presence 
was a bother to both Gilligan and 
Dr. Fieldgreen. 

At a quarter to one, Gilligan 
appeared at his elbow and sug- 
gested that they retire now. The 
process would continue until eight 
in the morning, there would be no 
change . 

But Schmidt shook his head. 

First, his personal body-clock 
now said that it was nearly seven in 
the morning in Berlin, the time he 
habitually rose without the help of 



THE EASTCOAST CONFINEMENT

an alarm. Soon he would get up 
and put on his thick blue-white 
robe. In the refrigerator would be a 
cool carton of yogurt. Five after 
seven the bell would ring and Rudi, 
the baker’s son, would bring him 
hot, crisp rolls. 

Second, Schmidt was much too 
interested in this process to 
abandon the scene now. 

He told Gilligan this much, leav- 
ing out the yogurt part. Then he 
tapped the young man on the 
shoulder in a fatherly way. “Go on 
home and get a good rest,’’ he said. 
“You probably have a wife waiting 
for you.’’ 

Gilligan blushed a little. It ap- 
peared that he had no wife. He was 
only thirty-two, and ani-fer asked 
you not to marry until thirty-five. 

“However that may be,’’ Schmidt 
said, “please feel free to go.’’ 

And third, he thought. But the 
real reason why Schmidt wanted to 
stay he kept to himself. 

Gilligan accepted the verdict and 
somewhat morosely he sat down on 
the couch and picked up the maga- 
zine he had been reading. It was 
the latest issue The Meditative 
Scientist. The lead article was 
“Gunnison’s Contributions in Men- 
tal Chemistry.’’ 

A little after two in the morning, 
Gilligan finally gave up his vigil. He 
rose and told Schmidt that, if it was 
all right with him, he’d slip off and 
grab a nap in the BDQ where he 
lived. Schmidt told him he’d made 
a wise decision and asked what 



BDQ stood for. Bachelor Detective 
Quarters, Gilligan told him. The 
BDQ was just a hop and a skip 
from here, and Gilligan had the 
phone number of his room written 
out on a slip of paper torn from a 
page of the magazine. Call him 
anytime. Then he bade good night 
and left. 

Still Schmidt waited. 

Apart from the hum of machin- 
ery and the on-and-off throb of an 
air compressor somewhere over- 
head, there was very little activity in 
the VPLE laboratory. At half past 
two Dr. Fieldgreen put In an ap- 
pearance and stayed for a short 
chat. He parted saying that he’d be 
unavailable for a while. His as- 
sistant, Miss Virginia Haut, could 
be reached by pushing that button 
just to the left of the Harmonizer’s 
picture on the wall. Miss Haut 
spoke German like a native. Dr. 
Fieldgreen said, as if to encourage 
Schmidt, and then he also left. 

Miss Haut did not make an ap- 
pearance, but Schmidt noted that a 
technician entered the action room 
in half hour intervals, glanced at 
instruments, and made marks on a 
sheet affixed to a clipboard. 

After a while Schmidt went to the 
toilet and, on the way, he looked 
around a bit. He opened a door 
here and glanced into a room there, 
and he saw that the place was 
empty. For a while he contem- 
plated pairs of rats wired in gleam- 
ing glass containers as they ex- 
changed lives. A papercluttered 



48 



GALAXY 




office with wood paneling would be 
Dr. Fieldgreen’s domain. Over the 
doctor’s desk he saw a clock. The 
time was nearly four. 

Schmidt went back to the waiting 
room just in time to see the techni- 
cian enter with his clipboard. 
Schmidt watched while inside his 
fifty-nine year chest his heart beat 
like that of a nine-year old. At last 
the technician took his leave, and 
Schmidt took a deep breath to calm 
himself. He squared his shoulders 
and walked through the glass door 
in the glass wall disregarding the 
DO NOT ENTER sign.

E mmanuel Toronto McCallum 
Salazar Rubeegol Timmy 
Smith whirled away into celestial 
agonies and then dropped down 
again like a leaf abandoned by the 
breeze. And then the breeze came 
back again and carried the 
androgynous Creature up again in 
a spiral through corridors of fusing 
experience . back, back, back 
once more to that which had been, 
until the plasticities of perception 
collapsed again and the Creature 
fell in a darkness down, down, 
down . but never far enough 
down, never down to the dark, still, 
limpid rest for which it longed. 

It was a roller-coaster to exhaus- 
tion. Each successive pass pene- 
trated deeper and fused ever more 
experience. Cell clusters fell into 
the relentless wine press of some 



kind of electronic force and gave up 
the juices of memory, and a male 
juice mingled with a female juice 
and dried on parched vistas of 
burning nerve deserts into visions. 

The Creature seethed with an 
enormity of insight. It longed to 
stop and to assess the fantastic ex- 
perience. Its fused parts started 
dialogues constantly interrupted by 
brutal shoves into yet other, 
deeper, and stranger tangles of re- 
call. On the ends of the whirling, 
egg-shaped mental cosmos cracks 
began to form. The Creature 
sensed in panic that those cracks 
might open and drain away the last 
cohesion of its being. Its structure 
of awareness groaned in the final 
stages of a pleasure so intense that 
it was a searing pain. 

Stop, screamed the Creature, 
falling once more, falling into a 
black darkness of total exhaustion. 
Stop, it screamed. I can’t stand it 
any more. 

And it stopped. Incredibly, it 
stopped. 

The Creature fell. It was a leaf in 
the shaft of a deep well. The 
orange-red blaze of experience was 
a receding circle of light above. It 
came down slowly, turning. It came 
to rest on the still surface of a mo- 
tionless sea. 

For a timeless moment the Crea- 
ture braced for the inevitable kick 
of forces that would spiral it up 
from its floating bed into a thou- 
sand tortures of mingling, but the 
kick didn’t come. The Creature lay

softly and there was only a won- 
drous silence all about. 

In that stillness and in that dark- 
ness, the Creature shaped an ego 
from the chaos by an act of reflec- 
tion, and it discovered itself to be 
Emmanuel Salazar, a Puerto Rican 
male, lately the leader of a clump of 
humanity inside a penal reservation 
on the island of Manhattan. For 
sound but unconscious reasons, 
Salazar also used numerous other 
names, including the patronymic 
‘Smith,’ whose purpose, he realiz- 
ed, was to set him apart and to en- 
hance his authority with the sugges- 
tion of Anglo ancestry. He ruled by 
a combination of skill and 
instinct — a magnetic personality, 
quick executive reflexes, and an in- 
stant conceptual grasp of small- 
unit warfare. He commanded re- 
spect and won high shares of the 
Man’s food distribution, and there- 
fore he was the key element in 
Brinco Pack’s survival. Through 
some kind of mechanical contriv- 
ance, the Eastcoast police had ex- 
posed him to the inner experience 
of the girl he had chosen for his 
fifth Queen, and he knew this be- 
cause she knew it. He assumed that 
Rubeegol also knew what he knew. 
She was the agent of a Movement 
they called Lady-cult inside the 
Confinement, and the network em- 
braced, by Salazar’s calculation, at 
least fifteen percent of all women 
Outside. Within a short time, per- 
haps less than a year, again by his 
calculations — combining what he 



knew (and now, for the first time, 
really understood) and what she 
knew — all of the Confinements in 
New Harmony would burst open 
like seedpods and engulf a sur- 
prised and unsuspecting world. 
From the ensuing collision would 
come — by inference from historical, 
cultural, anthropological, and psy- 
chological studies that Rubeegol’s 
mind had furnished him as evi- 
dence — a great cultural efflores- 
cence. 

Salazar smiled at the bottom of 
the well cradled in a leaf on the 
measureless ocean of darkness. He 
retraced the mingling with Rubee- 
gol’s mind and now, in that still- 
ness, he understood the process it- 
self and how the fusion of memories 
had taken place. Unaware of the 
mechanism, he had resisted the ex- 
perience with all of his ego ener- 
gies, and in the process he’d almost 
destroyed the structure of his mind. 
If he ever had to do it again, he 
would know what to do. He’d cast 
aside all resistance and plunge with 
a cry of abandon into the alien 
mind — so very much the same as 
his own, so very much One and in- 
separably human. 

And then he saw’ the dot of 
orange light at the top of the well 
grow in diameter until it became a 
blazing sun that came dowm toward 
him with a rush of light and fire, 
and he plunged eagerly into the 
kind, surprised, but welcoming 
mind of Karl Schmidt, Superin- 
tendent of the Berlin Police.

T he long arm of the clock on 
the wall moved dangerously 
close to the six. Schmidt expected 
the technician to come in any 
second with the clipboard. 

Don't go yet, Salazar’s mind said 
to him. Give her time to recover 
and to consolidate her ego. 

There was a kind of laughter in 
the mind, a joyousness, an antici- 
pation. He loves her, Schmidt 
thought. 

Of course I love her, Salazar 
laughed. How canyon help but love 
someone you are. 

They both knew that Rubeegol’s 
mind had swayed on the brink of 
collapse when Schmidt had at last 
released her for the leaf-like drop to 
the bottom of the well. They also 
knew that, given time, she’d make 
the same discoveries as Salazar had 
made, for she knew what he knew. 
Her impact on Schmidt had been 
lar more brutal than Salazar’s. 
Schmidt had clutched his head at 
the temples when the force pulled 
him into the panoramas of her be- 
ing. He had reared back like an 
epileptic with the shock. The man, 
by contrast, was in control. He gave 
of himself or he denied as he 
wished. He could carry on a conver- 
sation or wander about Schmidt’s 
memories taking this and leaving 
that. The power of his mind en- 
veloped Schmidt and made the old 
man marvel at the potentialities of 
the human brain. But time was 
running out. The consequence of a 
discovery were more hazardous 



than the benefit of another 
minute’s rest for Rubeegol. 
Schmidt thought “Good-bye” to 
Salazar and removed the netting 
from his head. He replaced it care- 
fully over the girl’s blond hair and 
then, furtively, like a fifty-nine year 
schoolboy, he slipped out through 
the door into the waiting room. 

He’d left just in time. The tech- 
nician entered and made for the 
gauges on the instrument console 
between the chairs. He lingered 
somewhat longer than usual, and 
his face darkened with puzzlement. 
He glanced at Rubeegol. He moved 
to her side. He removed and then 
replaced the netting on her head. 
Finally, back at the console, he 
nodded to himself and made a no- 
tation on his board. 

Schmidt sought the comfort of 
the couch, sank down, and closed 
his eyes. He smiled to himself, rich 
with information about the East- 
coast Confinement. He, she, and 
Salazar knew something perhaps 
no one else knew so well — the shape 
of the future. He knew less than 
they did, of course. He’d only 
gotten a brief, confused glimpse, 
but it had been enough to cheer 
him. Schmidt also hoped that the 
glimpse of him that was now theirs 
would have a balmful influence — 
like a vitamin or other vital trace 
element — in the growth of the 
Movement. He was sure that both 
of them would play major, perhaps 
decisive, roles in its future. 

The experience had drained him,

although it was still early. At the 
moment, in Berlin, it went on to- 
ward eleven in the morning — al- 
most time to walk down to Cafe 
Mayer where, in company of men 
who had long retired, Schmidt took 
a cup of coffee, a small brandy, and 
granted himself a single cigar. Mid- 
morning. He dozed off. 

Gilligan returned at seven-thirty 
restored to a pink, scrubbed, cheer- 
ful self full of eagerness to please. 
He brought a thermos of coffee for 
Herr Schmidt and a sweet roll. At a 
quarter to eight Dr. Fieldgreen 
walked through the waiting room 
muttering to himself. He clutched a 
set of paper discs marked by 
squiggly lines. He came back 
through again and then yet once 
more, until Gilligan stopped him 
and asked what it was that bother- 
ed him so. 

“Back to the drawing boards,” 
Dr. Fieldgreen muttered. He 
slapped a set of disks with a limp 
hand. “There is an inexplicable 
change in the pattern. It happened 
between four and four-thirty. We 
can’t figure it out.” He glanced at 
Schmidt. “Did you observe any- 
thing, Herr Schmidt?” 

Schmidt shook his head slowly. 
“I’m afraid I won’t be much help. 
After Mr. Gilligan left me in a 
lurch last night, I confess I followed 
his example and fell asleep on the 
couch.” He smiled. “Sorry.” 

“Damnable pattern,” Fieldgreen 
muttered, staring down at the disk. 
“It’s almost as if . .” He shook 



his head and walked out again. 

At eight o’clock the entire VPLE 
laboratory staff arrived for the con- 
clusion of the exercise. They crowd- 
ed around the glass of the observa- 
tion room while inside technicians 
uncoupled the victim-perpetrator 
pair. Schmidt stood at the window 
pretending consuming interest, but 
he already knew the strategy the 
couple would follow, something 
that he had worked out in a nano- 
second exchange of thought 
between himself and Salazar, 

It all went as planned. The 
couple acted disoriented, sluggish, 
and stupid. Everyone beamed on 
Schmidt’s side of the glass and ex- 
changed pleased nods and glances. 
Just like Abe Herzenberg Sultzy 
Chico Kid. Unresisting, the couple 
let itself be led into the van. Then, 
with Schmidt and Gilligan up front 
again, the group drove in early 
morning light — it was overcast 
now — through the much diminish- 
ed shimmer of holographic images 
north to the edge of the Confine- 
ment. 

Detectives pushed the couple out 
of the van on the periphery of the 
brick. It looked far more dreary 
and desolate to Schmidt than it had 
in the rainbow-shimmer of the 
night. Before the van backed away 
again, leaving the pair outlined 
against the ruins, both he and she 
contrived to shoot a glance of full 
awareness to Schmidt, a look only 
the three of them understood. 

The van backed away, turning. It 



52 



GALAXY 




lurched forward, backed again in 
the narrow road, and thea it pulled 
away toward the concrete geome- 
tricities of Manhattan. 

Emmanuel Salazar looked at the 
girl and she looked at him. Her face 
was his face, and he could read her 
eyes almost as if they were his own. 
There was still a little strangeness 
about her. He didn’t know all 
about her; he hadn’t plumbed her 
deepest being. The German had 
saved them. He had interrupted the 
process, and they both retained un- 
violated sanctuaries of irreducible 
privacy. His mind wheeled with the 
enormity of the task ahead, and he 
sensed that she had the same 
thought. So much to do. Har- 
mony’s new technology must be 
replicated. Raiding chiefs must be 
protected from the VPLE experi- 
ence. Greater cohesion must be 
created w'ithin. Forces must be 
freed for production work. Time 
w as of the essence. They had to win 
the race against GLSC. A track 
opened before his mental eyes. 
Soon he’d be chief of Peacefreak 
Tribe and later chief of chiefs. The 
process would be inevitable. He felt 
within him the fire and eloquence 
to move hearts, the will to over- 
come, and the intelligence to see 
the answers. And Rubeegol would 
remain his partner and mate 
throughout. She’d become the 
Lady’s surrogate. She of the Visible 
Expansion. Together they would 
link the Confinements into a coor- 
dinated w'hole. She’d rule the 



temple, and he’d rule the war. He 
saw a flickering in her eyes, and 
with gladness he dropped these 
thoughts and smiled at her in re- 
sponse. 

“You know, of course, that I love 
you.’’ 

“I never would have guessed,’’ 
she said. 

They embraced and kissed. 
When they broke apart, she said: 

“No, darling, I won’t scream in 
the Fire like Betty Simple did.’’ 

“That’s encouraging,” he said. 
“And I promise that I’ll bathe oc- 
casionally.” 

“I’d call that progress,” she said. 

“Come on,” he said, “after a 
night like this, I can hardly wait to 
get to know' you,” 

“What’ve you got in mind,” she 
asked. “A Janenight in the morn- 
ing?” 

“No, no. I don’t particularly care 
to be watched. Let’s have a dry 
run.” 

“Not too dry,” she said, and they 
both laughed. 

I T WAS the summer of 2008, a per- 
fectly ordinary year. On July 19th 
of that year, at 2:49 in the after- 
noon, Berlin’s Superintendent of 
Police boarded Lufthansa’s Flight 
301 for the transatlantic trip to 
Germany — and lest the old man get 
the wrong impression, a delegation 
of Eastcoast officials followed him 
all the way to the end of the ramp of 
Peaceful Abiding International 
Airport’s international terminal.

Karl Schmidt stood before them, 
tall, grave, his long face kindly. He 
had been briefed, he had been tour- 
ed, and now he assured the gentle- 
men that he had seen a very, very 
impressive display of American in- 
genuity. Yes, indeed, he said, 
America was and remained the 
land of promise, the beacon of the 
future. The officials were clearly 
pleased, and they waved to him as 
he boarded the jumbo jet. Hank 
Gilligan walked into the plane with 
him and made sure that he had a 
pillow and that his hat was properly 
put away into the overhead rack. 
Then, tears in his eyes, he shook 
hands with the German and, with a 
sob, turned and walked out. 

The plane took off and flew away 
east. Soon it plunged into the night 
that came rushing west. 

Schmidt did not sleep this time. 
He spent some hours on Level II, in 
the lounge, with a bottle of wine. 
He chatted with the senior 
stewardess. He enjoyed a light. 
Continental dinner. He browsed 
through some European news- 
papers he hadn’t seen in days and 
caught up on all the latest scandals, 
abductions, and civil disturbances. 
Finally he walked up the stairs to 
the observation room of the triple- 
decker jumbo. He took up a posi- 
tion in front of one of the large oval 
windows, folded his arms across his 
back, and reflected on the my- 
sterious unfolding of destiny. 

Strange, he thought, very 
strange. 



Inadvertently, unconsciously — or 
perhaps inspired by a kind of mad- 
ness that is really the ultimate in 
sanity — Ralph Waldo Gunnison 
had stumbled onto the solution, 
one solution. He had intensified the 
disunities, separations, fragmenta- 
tions, hatreds, and alienations that 
plagued the world. He had magni- 
fied the global disease to a point 
where man’s genius at last found an 
answer. A new culture grew like a 
fetus inside the womb of Confine- 
ment, and it would burst forth 
soon, its face still shrouded, its 
character unrevealed. For a while 
there would be turmoil and the 
clash of forces old and new; but 
then the world would hear a new 
song and march to a new drum- 
beat. 

Schmidt knew what he would tell 
the Senate. Wait, he’d say to them. 
Wait a couple of years. Oh, yes. 
Plan by all means. Plan in a 
low-key sort of way. Don’t 
announce it to the public. Planning 
would take the Senate’s attention 
off the issue. It would set their 
mind at ease about the future. And 
the future, Schmidt knew, would 
be revealed soon. In two years there 
would be no longer any Confine- 
ments on earth. 

The huge machine hummed 
competently through the darkness. 
In the sky stars hung in silence, un- 
moving. Then, suddenly, much 
sooner than he had expected, dawn 
drew a bright line across the 
horizon. ★

Like the man said: 
"War is Hell.’’ 



DAVID DRAKE 



^^rw^HiNK you’re going to like 
X killing, boy?” asked the old 
man on double crutches. 

Rob Jenne turned from the 
streams of moving cargo to his un- 
noticed companion in the shade of 
the starship’s hull. His own eyes 
were pale gray, suited like his dead- 
white skin to Burlage, whose ruddy 
sun could raise a blush but not a 
tan. When they adjusted, they took 
in the clerical collar which complet- 
ed the other’s costume. The 
smooth, black synthetic contrasted 
oddly with the coveralls and shirt of 
local weave. At that, the 
Curwinite’s outfit was a cut above 
Rob’s own, the same worksuit of 
Burlage sisal that he had worn as a 
quarryhand at home. Uniform 
issue would come soon. 

At least, he hoped and prayed it 
would. 

When the youth looked away 
after an embarrassed grin, the 
priest chuckled. ‘‘Another damned 
old fool, hey boy? There were a few 
in your family, weren’t there . 
the ones who’d quote the Book of 
the Way saying not to kill — and 
here you go off for a hired murder- 
er. Right?” He laughed again. 



seeing he had the younger man’s 
attention. ‘‘But that by itself 
wouldn’t be so hard to take — you 
were leaving your family anyway, 
weren’t you, nobody really believes 
they’ll keep close to their people 
after five years, ten years of star 
hopping. But your mates, though, 
the team you worked with . how 
did you explain to them why you 
were leaving a good job to go on 
contract? ‘Via!’” the priest 
mimicked, his tones so close to 
those of Barney Larsen, the gang 
boss, that Rob started in surprise, 
‘‘you get your coppy ass shot off, 
lad, and it’ll serve you right for 
being a fool!” 

‘‘How do you know I signed for a 
mercenary?” Jenne asked, clench- 
ing his great, calloused hands on 
the handle of his carry-all. It was 
everything he owned in the universe 
in which he no longer had a home. 
“And how’d you know about my 
Aunt Gudrun?” 

“Haven’t I seen a thousand of 
you?” the priest blazed back, his 
eyes like sparks glinting from the 
drill shaft as the sledge drove it 
deeper into the rock. “You’re 
young and strong and bright

enough to pass Alois Hammer’s 
tests — you be proud of that, boy, 
few enough are fit for Hammer’s 
Slammers. There you were, a man 
grown who’d read all the cop about 
mercenaries, believed most of 
it . more’n ever you did the 
Book of the Way, anyhow. Sure, I 
know. So you got some off-planet 
factor to send your papers in for 
you, for the sake of the bounty he’ll 
get from the Colonel if you make 
the grade — ” 

The priest caught Rob’s blink of 
surprise. He chuckled again, a 
cruel, unpriestly sound, and said, 
“He told you it was for friendship? 
One a these days you’ll learn what 
friendship counts, when you get an 
order that means the death of a 
friend — and you carry it out.” 

Rob stared at the priest in repul- 
sion, the grizzled chin resting on 
interlaced fingers and the crutches 
under either armpit supporting 
most of his weight. “It’s my life,” 
the recruit said with sulky defiance. 
“Soon as they pick me up here, you 
can go back to living your own. 
‘Less you’d be willing to do that 
right now?” 

“They’ll come soon enough, 
boy,” the older man said in a 
milder voice. “Sure, you’ve been 
ridden by everybody you know . 
now that you’re alone, here’s a 
stranger riding you too. I don’t 
mean it like 1 sound . wasn’t 
born to work, I guess. There’s 
priests^ — and maybe the better 
ones — who’d say that signing on 



with mercenaries means so long a 
spiral down that maybe your soul 
won’t come out of in another life or 
another hundred. But I don’t see it 
like that. 

“Life’s a forge, boy, and the 
purest metal comes from the 
hottest fire. When you’ve been 
under the hammer a few times, 
you’ll find you’ve been beaten down 
to the real, no lies, no excuses. 
There’ll be a time, then, when you 
got to look over the product . 
and if you don’t like what you see, 
well, maybe there’s time for 
change, too.” 

The priest turned his head to 
scan the half of the horizon not 
blocked by the bellied-down bulk of 
the starship. Ant columns of steve- 
dores manhandled cargo from the 
ship’s rollerway into horse and ox- 
drawn wagons in the foreground: 
like most frontier worlds, Burlage 
included, self-powered machinery 
was rare in the backcountry. 
Beyond the men and draft animals 
stretched the fields, studded fre- 
quently by orange-golden clumps of 
native vegetation. 

“Nobody knows how little his 
life’s worth till he’s put it on the 
line a couple times,” the old man 
said. “For nothing. Look at it here 
on Curwin — the seaboard taxed 
these uplands into revolt, then had 
to spend w'hat they’d robbed and 
more to hire an armored regiment. 
So boys like you from — Scania? 
Felsen?— ” 

“Burlage, sir.”

“Sure, a quarryman, should 
have known from your shoulders. 
Y ou come in to shoot farmers for a 
gang of coastal moneymen you 
don’t know and wouldn’t like if you 

did. ” The priest paused, less for 
effect than to heave in a quick, 
angry breath that threatened his 
shirt buttons. “And maybe you’ll 

die, too; if the Slammers were im- 
mortal, they wouldn’t need recruits. 
But some that die will die like 
saints, boy, die martyrs of the Way, 
for no reason, for no reason . 

“Your ride’s here, boy.” 

T he suddenly emotionless words 
surprised Rob as much as a 
scream in a silent prayer would 
have. Hissing like a gun-studded 
dragon, a gray-steel combat car slid 
onto the landing field from the 
west. Light dust puffed from be- 
neath it: although the flat-bed 
trailer behind was supported on 
standard wheels, the armored 
vehicle itself hovered a hand’s- 
breadth above the surface at all 
points. A dozen powerful fans on 
the underside of the car kept it 
floating on an invisible bubble of 
air, despite the weight of the fusion 
power unit and the steel-iridium 
armor. Rob had seen combat cars 
on the entertainment cube oc- 
casionally, but those skittering 
miniatures gave no hint of the awe- 
some power that emanated in 
reality from the machines. This one 
was ten meters long and three wide 
at the base, the armored sides 



curving up like a turtle’s back to 
the open fighting compartment in 
the rear. 

From the hatch in front of the 
powerplant stuck the driver’s head, 
a blank-mirrored ball in a helmet 
with full face shield down. Road 
dust drifted away from the man in a 
barely-visible haze, cleaned from 
the helmet’s optics by a static 
charge. Faceless and terrible to the 
unfamiliar Burlager, the driver 
guided toward the starship a 
machine that appeared no more in- 
human than did the man himself. 

“Undercrewed,” the priest mur- 
mured. “Two men on the back 
deck aren’t enough for a car 
running single.” 

The older man’s jargon was un- 
familiar but Rob could follow his 
gist by looking at the vehicle. The 
two men standing above the waist- 
high armor of the rear compart- 
ment were clearly fewer than had 
been contemplated when the com- 
bat car was designed. Its visible 
armament comprised a heavy 
powergun forward to fire over the 
head of the driver, and a similar 
weapon, also swivel-mounted, on 
either side to command the flanks 
and rear of the vehicle. But with 
only two men in the compartment 
there was a dangerous gap in the 
circle of fire the car could lay down 
if ambushed. Another vehicle for 
escort would have eased the 
danger, but this one was alone save 
for the trailer it drew. 

Though as the combat car drew 



58 



GALAXY 




closer, Rob began to wonder if the 
two soldiers present • couldn’t 
handle anything that occurred. 
Both were in full battle dress, 
wearing helmets and laminated 
back and breast armor over their 
khaki. Their faceplates were 
clipped open. The one at the for- 
ward gun, his eyes as deep-sunken 
and deadly as the three revolving 
barrels of his weapon, was in his 
Ibrties and further aged by the dust 
sweated into black grime in the 
creases of his face. His head rotated 
in tiny jerks, taking in every nuance 
of the sullen crowd parting for his 
war-car. The other soldier was huge 
by comparison with the first and 
lounged across the back in feigned 
leisure: feigned; because either 

hand was within its breadth of a 
powcrguirs trigger, and his limbs 
were as controlled as spring steel. 

With careless expertise, the 
driver backed his trailer up to the 
conveyor line. A delicate hand with 
the fans allowed him to angle them 
slightly, drifting the rear of the 
combat car to edge the trailer in the 
opposite direction. The larger sol- 
dier contemptuously thumbed a 
waiting horse and wagon out of its 
slot. The teamster’s curse brought 
only a grin and a big hand rested on 
a powergun’s receiver, less a threat 
than a promise. The combat car 
cased into the space. 

“Wait for an old man,” the 
priest said as Rob lifted his carry- 
all. "and I’ll go with you.” Glad 
even for that company, the recruit 



smiled nervously, fitting his stride 
to the other’s surprisingly nimble 
swing-and-pause, swing-and-pause. 

The driver dialed back minusculy 
on the power and allowed the big 
vehicle to settle to the ground with- 
out a skip or a tremor. One hand 
slid back the face shield to a high, 
narrow nose and eyes that alertly 
focused on the two men approach- 
ing. “The Lord and his martyrs!” 
the driver cried in amazement. 
“It’s Blacky himself come in with 
our newbie!” 

Both soldiers on the back deck 
slewed their eyes around at the cry. 
The smaller one took one glance, 
then leaped the two meters to the 
ground to clasp Rob’s companion. 
“Hey!” he shouted, oblivious to the 
recruit shifting his weight uncer- 
tainly, “Via, it’s good to see you! 
But what’rc you doing on Curwin?” 

“1 came back here afterwards,” 
the older man answered with a 
smile. “Born here, I must’ve told 
you . though we didn’t talk a 
lot. I’m a priest now, see?” 

“And I’m a flirt like the load 
wc’rc supposed to pick up,” the 
driver said, dismounting with more 
care than his companion. Abreast 
of the first soldier, he too took in 
the round collar and halted gape- 
mouthed. “Lord, I’ll be a coppy rag 
if you ain’t,” he breathed. “Who- 
ever heard of a blower captain 
taking the Way?” 

“.Shut up. Jake,” the first soldier 
said without rancor. He stepped 
back from the priest to take a

better look, then seemed to notice 
Rob. “Umm,” he said, “you the re- 
cruit from Burlage?” 

“Yessir. M-my name’s Rob 
Jenne, sir.” 

“Not ‘sir’, there’s enough sirs 
around already,” the veteran said. 
‘Tm Chero, except if there’s lots of 
brass around, then make it Ser- 
geant-Commander Worzer. Look, 
take your gear back to the trailer 
and give Leon a hand with the load. 

“Hey, Blacky,” he continued 
with concern, ignoring Rob again, 
“what’s wrong with your legs? We 
got the best there was.” 

“Oh, they’re fine,” Rob heard 
the old man reply, “but they need a 
weekly tuning. Out here we don’t 
have the computers, you know; so I 
get the astrogation boys to sync me 
up on the ships’ hardware whenever 
one docks in — ^just waiting for a 
chance now. But in six months the 
servos are far enough out of line 
that 1 have to shut off the power till 
the next ship arrives. You’d be sur- 
prised how well I get around on 
these pegs, though . .” 

Leon, the huge third crew mem- 
ber, had loosed the top catches of 
his body armor for ventilation. 
From the look of it, the laminated 
casing should have been a size 
larger; but Rob wasn’t sure any- 
thing larger was made. The 
gunner’s skin where exposed was 
the dense black of a basalt out- 
cropping. “They’ll be a big crate to 
go on, so just set your gear down till 
we get it loaded,” he said. Then he 



grinned at Rob, teeth square and 
slightly yellow against his face. 
“Think you can take me?” 

That was a challenge the recruit 
could understand, the first he could 
meet fairly since boarding the star- 
ship with a one-way ticket to a 
planet he had never heard of. He 
took in the waiting veteran quickly 
but carefully, proud of his own 
rock-hardened muscles but certain 
the other man had been raised just 
as hard. “1 give you best,” the 
blond said. “Unless you feel you 
got to prove it?” 

The grin broadened and a great 
black hand reached out to clasp 
Rob’s. “Naw,” the soldier said, 
“just like to clear the air at the 
start. Some of the big ones; Lord, 
testy ain’t the word. All they can 
think about’s what they want to 
prove with me . so they don’t 
watch their side of the car, and 
then there’s trouble for everybody.” 

“Hammer’s Regiment?” called 
an unfamiliar voice. Both men 
looked up. Down the conveyor rode 
a blue-tunicked ship’s man in front 
of what first appeared to be a huge 
crate. At second glance Rob saw 
that it was a cage of light alloy hold- 
ing four . “Dear Lord!” the re- 
cruit gasped. 

“Roger, Hammer’s,” Leon 
agreed, handing the crewman a 
plastic chit while the latter cut 
power to the rollers to halt the cage. 
The chit slipped into the computer 
linkage on the crewman’s left wrist, 
lighting a green indicator when it 



60 



GALAXY 




proved itself a genuine bill of 
lading. 

There were four female human- 
oids in the cage — stark naked ex- 
cept for a dusting of fine blue 
scales. Rob blinked. One of the 
near-women stood and with a 
smile — Lord, she had no teeth! — 
and rubbed her groin deliberately 
against one of the vertical bars. 

“First quality Genefran flirts,” 
Ixon chuckled. “Ain’t human, 
boy, but the next best thing.” 

“Better," threw in Jake, who had 
swung himself into the fighting 
compartment as soon as the cage 
arrived. “I tell you. kid. you never 
had it till you had a flirt. Surgically 
modified and psychologically pre- 
pared. Rowf!” 

“N-not human?” Rob stumbled, 
unable to take his eyes off the cage, 
“you mean like monkeys?" 

Leon’s grin lit his face again, and 
the driver cackled, “Well, don’t 
know about monkeys, but they’re a 
whole lot like sheep.” 

“You take the left side and we’ll 
get this aboard,” Leon directed. 

1 he trailer’s bed was half a meter 
below the rollerway so that the 
cage, though heavy and awkward, 
could be slid without much lifting. 

Rob gripped the bars numbly, 
tuniing his face down from the 
tittering beside him. “Amazing 
w hat they can do with implants and 
a w ig,” Jake w as going on, “though 
a course there’s a lot of cutting to 
do first, but those ain’t the -differ- 
ences you see, if you follow. The 



scales, now — they have a way — ” 

“Lift!” Leon ordered, and Rob 
straightened at the knees. They 
took two steps backward with the 
cage wobbling above them as the 
girls — the flirts! — squealed and 
hopped about. “Dowm!” and cage 
clashed on trailer as the two big 
men moved in unison. 

Rob stepped back, his mouth 
w orking in distaste, unaware of the 
black soldier’s new' look of respect. 
On an y work left a man used to 
awkward weights. “This is foul,” 
the recruit marveled. “Are those 
really going back with us for, 
for ...” 

“Rest’n relaxation,” Leon 
agreed, snapping tie-downs around 
(he bars. 

“But how . .” Rob began, 
looking again at the cage. When 
the red-wigged fiirt fondled her left 
breast upward, he could see the im- 
plant scars pale against the blue, 
fhe scales were more thinly spread 
where the skin had been stretched 
in molding it. “I’ll never touch 
something like that. Look, maybe 
Burlage is pretty backward 
about . things, about sex, 1 
don’t know. But I don’t see how 
anybody could ... I mean — ” 

“Via, wait till you been here as 
long as we have,” Jake gibed. He 
clenched his right hand and 
pumped it suggestively. “Field ex- 
pedients. that’s all.” 

“On this kinda contract,” Leon 
explained, stepping around to get 
at the remaining tie-downs, “you 



UNDER THE HAMMER 



61 




can’t trust the local girls. Least not 
in the field, like we are. The 
Colonel likes to keep us patrol sec- 
tions pretty much self-contained.” 

“Yeah,” Jake broke in — would 
his cracked tenor never cease? 
“Why, some of these whores, they 
take a razor blade, see — in a cord, 
you know? — and, well never 
mind.” He laughed, seeing Rob’s 
face. 

“Jake,” Sgt. Worzer called, 
“hop in.” 

The driver slipped instantly into 
his hatch. t)isgusting as Rob found 
the little man, he recognized his 
ability. Jake moved with lethal cer- 
tainty and a speed that belied the 
weight of his body armor. 

“Ready to lift, Chero?” he 
asked. 

T he priest was levering himself 
toward the starship again, 
Worzer watched him go for a mo- 
ment, shook his head. “Just run us 
out to the edge of the field,” he 
directed. “1 got a few things to 
show our recruit before we head 
back; nobody rides in my car with- 
out knowing how to work the 
guns.” With a sigh he hopped into 
the fighting compartment. Leon 
motioned Rob in front of him. 
Gingerly, the recruit stepped onto 
the trailer hitch, gripped the 
armored rim with both hands, 
lifted himself about. Leon followed. 
The trailer bonged as he pushed off 
from it, and his bulk cramped the 
littered compartment as soon as he 



grunted over the side. 

“Put this on,” Worzer ordered, 
handing Rob a dusty, bulbous 
helmet like the others wore. 
“Brought a battle suit for you, 
too.” he said, kicking the jointed 
armor leaning against the back of 
the compartment, “but it’d no 
more fit you than it would Leon 
there,” 

The black laughed. “Gonna be 
tight back here till the kid or me 
gets zapped.” 

“Move’er out,” Worzer ordered. 
The words came through unsus- 
pected earphones in Rob’s helmet, 
although the sergeant had simply 
spoken, without visibly activating a 
pickup. 

The car vibrated as the fans 
revved, then lifted with scarcely a 
jerk. From behind came the 
squeals and chirrups of the frills as 
the trailer rocked over the irregu- 
larities in the rammed-earth field. 

Worzer looked hard at the star- 
ship’s open crew portal as they 
hissed past it. “Funny what folks 
go an’ do,” he said to no one in par- 
ticular. “Via, wonder what I’ll be 
in another ten years.” 

“Pet food, likely,” joked the 
driver, taking part in the conversa- 
tion although physically separated 
from the other crewmen. 

“.Shut up, Jake.” repeated the 
blower captain. “And you can hold 
it up here, we’re out far enough.” 

fhe combat car obediently 
settled on the edge of the stabilized 
area. The port itself had capacity 



62 



GALAXY 




for two ships at a time; the region it 
served did not. Though with the 
high cost of animal transport many 
manufactures could be star-hopped 
to Curwin’s back country more 
cheaply than they could be carried 
from the planet’s own more urban- 
ized areas, the only available ex- 
change was raw' agricultural pro- 
duce — again limited to the immedi- 
ate locality by the archaic trans- 
port. Its fans purring below audi- 
bility, the armored vehicle rested 
on an empty area of no significance 
to the region — unless the central 
government should choose to land 
another regiment of mercenaries on 
it. 

“Look,” the sergeant said, his 
deep-set eyes catching Rob’s, “we’ll 
pass you on to the firebase when w'e 
take the other three frills in next 
week. They got a training section 
there. We got six cars in this patrol, 
that’s not enough margin to fool 
with training a newbie. But 
neither's it enough to keep some- 
body useless underfoot for a week, 
so we’ll give you some basics. Not 
so you can wise-ass when you get to 
training section, just so you don’t 
get somebody killed if it drops in 
the pot. Clear?” 

“Yessir.” Rob broke his eyes 
away, then realized how foolish he 
must look staring at his own 
clasped hands. He looked back at 
Worzer. 

“Just so it’s understood,” the 
sergeant said with a nod. “Leon, 
show him how the gun works.” 



The big black rotated his weapon 
so that the muzzles faced forward 
and the right side was toward Rob 
and the interior of the car. The 
mechanism itself was encased in 
dull-enameled steel ornamented 
with knobs and levers of unguess- 
able intent. The barrels were 
stubby iridium cylinders with 
smooth, two-centimenter bores. 
Leon touched one of the buttons, 
then threw a lever back. The plate 
to which the barrels were attached 
rotated 120 degrees around their 
common axis, and a thick disk of 
plastic popped out into the 
gunner’s hand. 

“When the bottom barrel’s ready 
to fire, the next one clockwise is 
loading one a these” — Leon held 
up the 2 cm disk — “and the other 
barrel, the one that’s just fired, 
blows out the empty.” 

“There’s a liquid nitrogen 
ejector,” Worzer put in. “Cools the 
bore same time it kicks out the 
empty.” 

“She feeds up through the 
mount,” the big soldier went on, 
his index finger tracing the path of 
the energized disks from the closed 
hopper bulging in the sidewall, 
through the ball joint and into the 
weapon’s reeeiver. “If you try to 
lire and she don’t, check this.” I'he 
columnar finger indieated but did 
not move the stud it had first 
pressed on the side of the gun. 
“ That’s the safety. She still doesn’t 
lire, pull this” — he clacked the 
lever, rotating the barrel cluster an- 



UNDERTHE HAMMER

other one-third turn and catching 
the loaded round that flew out. 
“Maybe there was a dud round. 
She still don’t go, just get down 
outa the way. We start telling you 
about second-order malfunctions 
and you won’t remember where the 
trigger is.’’ 

“Ah, where is the trigger?” Rob 
asked diffidently. 

Jake’s laughter rang through the 
earphones and Worzer himself 
smiled for the first time. The ser- 
geant reached out and rotated the 
gun. "See the grips?” he asked, 
pointing to the double handles at 
the back of the receiver. Rob 
nodded. 

“Okay,” Worzer continued, 
“you hold it there” — he demon- 
strated — “and to fire, you just 
press your thumbs against the 
trigger plate between’em. Let up 
and it quits. Simple.” 

“You can clear this field as quick 
as you can spin this little honey,” 
l.eon said, patting the gun with af- 
fection. “The hicks out there” — his 
arm swept the woods and cultivated 
fields promiscuously — “got some 
lilies, they hunted ’fore the trouble 
started, but no powerguns to men- 
tion. About all they do since we 
moved in is maybe pop a shot or 
two off, and hide in their holes.” 

“ riicy’ve got some underground 
stockpiles,” Worzer said, amplify- 
ing l.eon’s words, “explosives, 
maybe some factories to make rifle 
ammo. But the Colonel set up a 
recce net — spy satellites, you 



know — as part a the contract. Any 
funny movement day or night, a 
signal goes down to whoever’s 
patrolling there. A couple calls and 
we check out the area with ground 
sensors . anything funny then — 
vibration, hollows showing up on 
the echo sounder, magnetics — any- 
thing!^ — and bam! we call in the 
artillery.” 

“Won’t take much of a jog on the 
way back,” Leon suggested, “and 
we can check out that report from 
last night.” 

“Via, that was just a couple 
dogs,” Jake objected. 

“Okay, so we prove it was a 
couple dogs,” rumbled the gunner. 
“Or maybe the hicks got smart and 
they're shielding their infra-red 
now . Been too damn long since 
anything popped in this sector.” 

“Thing to remember, kid,” Wor- 
zer summed up, “is never get 
buzzed at this job. Stay cool, you’re 
fine. This car’s got more fire- 
power’n everything hostile in fifty 
kilos. One call to the firebase 
brings in our arty, anything from 
smoke shells to a nuke. The rest of 
our section can be here in twenty 
minutes, or a tank platoon from the 
firebase in two hours. Just stay 
cool.” 

T urning forward, the sergeant 
said. “Okay, take her home, 
Jake. We’ll try that movement re- 
port on the way.” 

The combat car shuddered off 
the ground, the frills shrieking.

Rob eyed them, blushed, and 
turned back to his powergun, feel- 
ing conspicuous. He took the grips, 
liking the deliberate way the 
weapon swung. The safety button 
was glowing green, but he suddenly 
realized that he didn’t know the 
color code. Green for safe? Or 
green for ready? He extended his 
index finger to the switch. 

“Whoa, careful, kid!’’ Leon 
warned. “You cut fifty civvies in 
half your first day and the Colonel 
won’t like it one bit.’’ 

Sheepishly, Rob drew back his 
finger. His ears burned, mercifully 
hidden beneath the helmet. 

They slid over the dusty road in a 
fiat, white cloud at about forty 
KPH. It seemed shockingly fast to 
the recruit, but he realized that the 
car could probably move much 
faster were it not for the live cargo 
behind. Even as it was, the trailer 
bounced dangerously from side to 
side. 

The road led through a gullied 
scattering of grain plots, generally 
fenced with withes rather than im- 
ported metal. Houses were rela- 
tively uncommon. Apparently each 
farmer plowed several separate lo- 
cations rather than trying to work 
the rugged or less productive areas. 
Occasionally they passed a rough- 
garbed local at work. The scowls 
thrown up at the smoothly-running 
war car were hostile, but there was 
nothing more overt. 

“Okay,” Jake warned, “here’s 
where it gets interesting. Sure you 



still want this half-assed check 
while we got the trailer hitched?” 

“It won’t be far,” Worzer an- 
swered. “Go ahead.” He turned to 
Rob, touching the recruit’s shoul- 
der and pointing to the lighted map 
panel beside the forward gun. 
“Look, Jenne,” he said, keeping 
one eye on the countryside as Jake 
took the car off the road in a sweep- 
ing turn, “if you need to call in a lo- 
cation to the firebase, here’s the 
trick. The red dot” — it was in the 
center of the display and remained 
there although the map itself seem- 
ed to be flowing kitty-corner across 
the screen as the combat car 
moved — “that’s us. The black 
dot” — the veteran thumbed a small 
wheel beside the display and the 
map, red dot and all, shifted to the 
right on the panel, leaving a black 
dot in the center — “that’s your 
pointer. The computer feeds out 
the grid coordinates here” — his 
finger touched the window above 
the map display. Six digits, chang- 
ing as the map moved under the 
centered black dot, winked 
brightly. “You just put the black 
dot on a bunker site, say, and read 
off the figures to Fire Control Cen- 
tral. The arty’ll do all the rest.” 

“Ah,” Rob murmured, “ah . 
sergeant, how do you get the little 
dot off that and onto a bunker like 
you said?” 

There was a moment’s silence. 
“You know how to read a map, 
don’t you, kid?” Worzer finally 
asked. 



UNDER THE HAMMER

“What’s that, sir?” 

The earphones boomed and 
cackled with raucous laughter. 
“Oh my coppy ass!” the sergeant 
snarled. He snapped the little wheel 
back, re-centering the red dot. 
“Lord, I don’t know how the train- 
ing cadre takes it!” 

Rob hid his flaming embarrass- 
ment by staring over his gunsights. 
He didn’t really know how to use 
them, either. He didn’t know why 
he’d left Conner’s Stoneworks, 
where he was the cleanest, fastest 
driller on the whole coppy crew. His 
powerful hands squeezed at the 
grips as if they were the driver’s 
throat through which bubbles of 
laughter still burst. 

“Shut up, Jake,” the sergeant 
finally ordered. “Most of us had to 
learn something new when we 
joined. Remember how the of man 
found you your first day, pissing up 
against the barracks?” 

Jake quieted. 

They had skirted a fence of cane 
palings, brushing it once without 
serious effect. Russet grass flank- 
ing the fence flattened under the 
combat car’s downdraft, then 
sprang up unharmed as the vehicle 
moved past. Jake seemed to be 
following a farm track leading from 
the field to a rambling, substan- 
tially-constructed building on the 
near hilltop. Instead of running 
with the ground’s rise, however, the 
car cut through brush and down a 
half-meter bank into a broad-based 
arroyo. The bushes were too stiff to 



lie down under the fans. They 
crunched and howled in the blades, 
making the car buck, and rico- 
cheted wildly from under the skirts. 
The bottom of the arroyo was sand, 
clean-swept by recent run-off. It 
boiled fiercely as the car first 
shoomped into it, then ignored the 
fans entirely. Somehow Jake had 
managed not to overturn the 
trailer, although its cargo had been 
screaming with fear for several 
minutes. 

“Hold up,” Worzer ordered 
suddenly as he swung his weapon 
toward the left-hand bank. The 
wash was about thirty meters wide 
at that point, sides sheer and a 
meter high. Rob glanced forward to 
see that a small screen to Worzer’s 
left on the bulkhead, previously 
dark, was now crossed by three 
vari-colored lines. The red one was 
bouncing frantically. 

“They got an entrance, sure 
’nough,” Leon said. He aimed his 
powergun at the same point, then 
snapped his face sheild down. 
“Watch it, kid,” he said. The 
black’s right hand fumbled in a 
metal can welded to the blower’s 
side. Most of the paint had chipped 
from the stencilled legend: gre- 
nades. What appeared to be a lazy 
overarm toss snapped a knobby 
ball the size of a child’s fist straight 
and hard against the bank. 

Dirt and' rock fragments shot- 
gunned in all directions. The gully 
side burst in a globe of black 
streaked with garnet fire, followed 



66 



GALAXY 




by a shock wave that was a physical 
blow. 

“Watch your side, kid!” some- 
body shouted through the din, but 
Rob’s bulging eyes were focused on 
the collapsing bank, the empty tri- 
angle of black gaping suddenly 
through the dust — the two ravening 
whiplashes of directed lightning 
ripping into it to blast and scatter. 

The barrel clusters of the two 
veterans’ powerguns spun whining, 
kicking gray, eroded disks out of 
their mechanisms in nervous arcs. 
The bolts they shot were blue-green 
Hashes barely visible until they 
struck a target and exploded it with 
transferred energy. The very rocks 
burst in droplets of glassy slag 
splashing high in the air and even 
back into the war-car to pop 
against the metal. 

I. con’s gun paused as his fingers 
hooked another grenade. “Hold 
it!” he v\arned. The sergeant, too, 
canic ofl the trigger, and the bomb 
arrowed into the now-vitrified gap 
in tlic tunnel mouth. Dirt and glass 
shards blew straight back at the 
bang. A stretch of ground sagged 
for twenty meters beyond the gully 
wall, closing the tunnel the first 
explosion had opened. 

I hen there was silence. Even the 
frills, huddled in a terrified heap on 
the Hoor of their cage, were sound- 
less. 

Cjlowing orange specks vibrated 
on Rob’s retinas; the cyan bolts had 
been more intense than he had 
rcali/.cd. “Via,” he said in awe. 



“how do they dare . .?” 

“Bullet kills you just as dead,” 
Worzer grunted. “Jake, think you 
can climb that wall?” 

“Sure. She’ll buck g mite in the 
loose stuff.” The gully side was a 
gentle declivity, now, where the gre- 
nades had blown it in. “Wanna un- 
hitch the trailer first?” 

“Negative, nobody gets off the 
blower till we cleaned this up.” 
“Umm, don’t want to let some- 
body else in on the fun, maybe?” 
the driver queried. If he was tense, 
his voice did not indicate it. Rob’s 
palms were sweaty. His glands had 
understood before his mind had 
that his companions were consider- 
ing smashing up, unaided, a guer- 
rilla stronghold. 

“Cop,” Leon objected deter- 
minedly. “We found it, didn’t we?” 
“Let’s go,” Worzer ordered. 
“Kid. watch your side. They sure 
got another entrance, maybe a 
couple.” 

The car nosed gently toward the 
subsided bank, wallowed briefly as 
the driver fed more power to the 
forw ard fans to lift the bow. With a 
surge and a roar, the big vehicle 
climbed. Its fans caught a few 
pebbles and w hanged them around 
inside the plenum chamber like a 
rattle of sudden gunfire. At half 
speed, the ear glided toward an- 
other fenced grainplot, leaving be- 
hind it a rising pall of dust. 

“Straight as a plumb line,” Wor- 
zer commented, his eyes flicking 
his sensor screen. “Bastards’ll be

waiting for us.” 

R ob glanced at him — a mis- 
take. The slam-spang! of shot 
and ricochet were nearly simul- 
taneous. The recruit whirled back, 
bawling in surprise. The rifle pit 
had opened within five meters of 
him. and only the haste of the dark- 
featured guerrilla had saved Rob 
tVoni his first shot. Rob pivoted his 
powergun like a hammer, both 
thumbs mashing down the trigger. 
Nothing happened. The guerrilla 
ducked anyway, the black circle of 
his foxhole shaped into a thick cres- 
cent by the lid lying askew. 

Safety, safety! Rob’s mind 
screamed and he punched the 
button fat- fingered. The rifleman 
raised his head just in time to meet 
the hose of fire that darted from the 
recruit’s gun. The guerrilla’s head 
exploded. His brains, flash-cooked 
by the first shot, changed instantly 
from a colloid to a blast of steam 
that scattered itself over a three- 
meter circle. The smouldering frag- 
ments of the rifle followed the torso 
as it slid downward. 

The combat car roared into the 
field of waist-high grain, ripping 
dow n twenty meters of woven fenc- 
ing to make its passage. Rob, 
vaguely aware of other shots and 
cries forward, vomited onto the 
floor of the compartment. A 
colossal explosion nearby slewed 
the car sidew ays. As Rob raised his 
eyes, he noticed three more swarthy 
riflemen darting through the grain 



from the right rear of the vehicle. 

“Here!” he cried. He swiveled his 
weapon blindly, his hips colliding 
with Worzer in the cramped space. 
A rifle bullet cracked past his hel- 
met. He screamed something again 
but his ow n fire was too high, blue- 
green droplets against the clear 
sky, and the guerrillas had grabbed 
the bars w hile the frills jumped and 
blatted. 

The rifles were slamming but the 
frills were in the way of Rob’s gun. 
“Down! Down!” he shouted use- 
lessly, and the red-haired frill 
pitched across the cage with one 
synthetic breast torn away by the 
bullet she had leaped in front of. 
l.eon cursed and slumped against 
Rob’s feet, and then it was Chero 
Worzer shouting, “Hard left, 
Jake,” and leaning across the fallen 
gunner to rotate his weapon. The 
combat car tilted left as the bow 
came around, pinching the trailer 
against the left rear of the vehicle — 
in the path of Worzer’s powergun. 
fhe cage’s light alloy bloomed in 
superheated fireballs as the cyan 
bolts ripped through it. Both tires 
exploded together, and there was a 
red mist of blood in the air. The 
one guerrilla who had ducked 
under the burst dropped his rifle 
and ran. 

Worzer cut him in half as he took 
his third step. 

fhe sergeant gave the wreckage 
only a glance, then knelt beside 
Leon. “Cop, he’s gone,” he said, 
fhe bullet had struck the big man

in the neck between helmet and 
body armor, and there was almost a 
gallon of blood on the floor of the 
compartment. 

“Leon?” Jake asked. 

“Yeah. Lord, there musta been 
twenty kilos of explosive in tl.'at sat- 
chel charge. If he hadn’t hit it in 
the air ...” Worzer looked back 
at the wreck of the trailer, then at 
Rob. “Kid, can you unhitch that 
yourself?” 

“You just killed them,” Rob 
blurted. He was half blinded by 
tears and the after-image of the 
gunfire. 

“Via, they did their best on us, 
didn’t they?” the sergeant snarled. 
His face was tiger striped by dust 
and sweat. 

“No, not them!” the boy cried. 
“Not them — the girls. You just — ” 

Worzer’s iron fingers gripped 
Rob by the chin and turned the re- 
cruit remorselessly toward the car- 
nage behind. The frills had been 
torn apart by their own fluids, some 
pieces flung through gaps in the 
mangled cage. “Look at’em, 
Jenne!” Worzer demanded. “They 
ain’t human but if they was, if it 
was Leon back there. I’d a done 
it.” 

His fingers uncurled from Rob’s 
chin and slammed in a fist against 
the car’s armor. “This ain’t heroes, 
it ain’t no coppy game you play 
when you want to! You do what you 
got to do, ’cause if you don’t, some 
poor bastard gets killed later when 
he tries to. 



“Now get down there and 
unhitch us.” 

“Yes, sir.” Rob gripped the lip 
of the car for support. 

Worzer’s voice, more gentle, 
came through the haze of tears: 
“And watch it, kid. Just because 
they’re keeping their heads down 
don’t mean they’re all gone.” 
Then, “Wait.” Another pause 
while the sergeant unfastened the 
belt and bolstered handgun from 
his waist and handed it to Rob. 
Leon wore a similar weapon, but 
Worzer did not touch the body. 
Rob wordlessly clipped the belt, 
loose for not being fitted over 
armor, and swung down from the 
combat car. 

The hitch had a quick-release 
handle, but the torqueing it had re- 
ceived in the last seconds of battle 
had jammed it. Nervously aware 
that the sergeant’s darting-eyed 
watchfulness was no pretense, that 
the shot-scythed grainfield could 
hide still another guerrilla, or a pla- 
toon of them, Rob smashed his 
boot heel against the catch. It held. 
Wishing for his driller’s sledge, he 
kicked again. 

“Sarge!” Jake shouted. Grain 
rustled on the other side of the 
combat car and against the sky be- 
yond the scarred armor loomed a 
parcel. Rob threw himself flat. 

T he explosion picked him up 
from the ground and bounced 
him twice, despite the shielding 
bulk of the combat car. Stumbling 



UNDER THE HAMMER

upright, Rob steadied himself on 
the armored side. 

The metal felt odd. It no longer 
trembled with the ready power of 
the fans. The car was dead, lying 
at rest on the torn-up soil. With 
three quick strides, the reeruit 
rounded the bow of the vehicle. He 
had no time to inspect the dished-in 
metal, because another swarthy 
guerrilla was approaching from the 
other side. 

Seeing Rob, the e.\-farmer shout- 
ed something and drew a long 
knife. Rob took a step back, re- 
membered the pistol. He tugged at 
its unfamiliar grip and the weapon 
popped free into his hand. It seem- 
ed the most natural thing in the 
world to finger the safety, placed 
just as the tri-barrel’s had been, 
then trigger two shots into the face 
of the hinging guerrilla. The snarl 
of hatred blanked as the body tum- 
bled face-down at Rob’s feet. The 
knile had flow n somewhere into the 
grain. 

“Fbros?” a man ealled. Another 
lid had raised from the ground ten 
meters away. Rob fired at the hole, 
missed badly. He climbed the 
caved-in bow , clumsily one-handed, 
keeping the pistol raised. There 
was nothing but twisted metal 
where the driver had been. Sgt. 
Worzer was still semi-erect, clutch- 
ed against his powergiin by a length 
of structural tubing. It had curled 
around both his thighs, fluid under 
the stunning impact of the satchel 
charge. The map display was a 



pearly blank, though the window 
above it still read incongruously 
614579 and the red line on the de- 
tector screen blipped in nervous 
solitude. Worzer’s helmet was 
gone, having flayed a bloody traek 
across his scalp as it sailed away. 
His lips moved, though, and when 
Rob put his face near the sergeant’s 
he could hear, “The red . pull 
the red tab ...” 

Over the left breast of each set of 
armor were a blue and a red tab. 
Rob had assumed they were deco- 
rations of some sort. He shifted the 
sergeant gently. The tab was locked 
down by a eotter pin which he 
yanked out. Something hissed in 
the armor as he pulled the tab, and 
Sgt. Worzer murmured, “Oh Lord. 
Oh Lord.” Then, “Now' the stimu- 
lant, the blue tab.” 

After the second injection sped 
into his system, the sergeant 
opened his eyes. Rob was already 
trying to straighten the entrapping 
tube. “Forget it,” Worzer ordered 
weakly. “It’s inside, too . damn 
armor musta Hexed. Oh Lord.” He 
closed his eyes, opened them in 
time to sec another head peak cau- 
tiously from the tunnel mouth. 
“Bastard!” he rasped, and faster 
than he spoke he triggered his 
powergun. Its motor whined spite- 
fully though the burst went wide. 
I'he head disappeared. 

“I want you to run back to the 
gully,” the sergeant said, resting 
his eyes again. “You get there, you 
say ‘Fire Central’. That cuts in the 



70 



GALAXY 




arty frequency automatic. Then 
you say, ‘Bunker complex . 
Worzer looked down. ‘“Slx-one- 
lour, five-seven-nine.’ Stay low and 
wait for a patrol.” 

‘‘It won’t bend!” Rob snarled in 
frustration as his fingers slid again 
Ironi the blood-slick tubing. 

‘‘Jenne, get your ass out of here, 
now. ” 

‘‘Sergeant — ” 

‘‘Lord curse your soul, get out or 
I’ll call it in myself! Do I look like I 
wanna live?” 

‘‘Oh, Via . .” Rob tried to re- 
holster the pistol he had set on the 
bloody floor. It slipped back with a 
clang. He left it, gripping the side- 
wall again. 

‘‘Maybe tell Dad it was good to 
see him,” Worzer whispered. “You 
lose touch in this business, Lord 
knows you do.” 

“Sir?” 

“The priest . you met him. 
Sergeant-Major Worzer, he was. 
Oh Lord, move it — ” 

At the muffled scream, the re- 
cruit leaped from the smashed war 
car and ran blindly back the way 
they had come. He did not know he 
had reached the gully until the 
ground flew out from under him 
and he pitched spread-eagled onto 
the sand. “Fire Central,” he 
sobbed through strangled breaths, 
“Fire Central.” 

“Clear,” a strange voice snapped 
crisply. “Data?” 

“Wh-what?” 

“Lord and martyrs,” the voice 



blasted, “if you’re screwing around 
on firing channels, you’ll wish you 
never saw daylight!” 

“S-six ... oh Lord, yes, six one 
four, five seven nine,” Rob sing- 
songed. He was staring at the 
smooth sand. “Bunkers, the ser- 
geant says it’s bunkers.” 

“Roger,” the voice said, busi- 
nesslike again. “Ranging in 
fifteen.” 

Could they really swing those 
mighty guns so swiftly, those snub- 
barrelled rocket howitzers whose 
firing looked so impressive on the 
entertainment cube? 

“On the way,” warned the voice. 

The big tri-barrel whined again 
from the combat car, the silent lash 
of its bolts answered this time by a 
crash of rifle shots. A flattened 
bullet burred through the air over 
where Rob lay. It was lost in the 
eerie, thunderous shriek from the 
northwest. 

“Splash,” the helmet said. 

The ground bucked. From the 
grainplot spouted rock, smoke and 
metal fragments into a black 
column fifty meters high. 

“Are we on?” the voice 
demanded. 

“Oh Lord,” Rob prayed, beating 
his fists against the sand, “Oh 
Lord.” 

“Via, what is this?” the helmet 
wondered aloud. Then, “All guns, 
battery five.” 

And the earth began to ripple 
and gout under the hammer of the 
guns. ¥■

WITCH 




JAMES F. LACEY 



W HEN Norm punched Atmos- 
phere 32, his six-by-nine flop 
with its Class 24 components be- 
came moonlit sandy beach com- 
plete with sound of surf, smell of 
sea. He donned his autobarber, 
buckled his excribelt and pondered 
the mysteries of a simulated 
gibbous moon. There should be a 



lighthouse, he felt, and a girl with a 
strange mind, though he had never 
seen a beach or an ocean — had 
never, in fact, felt any inclination to 
venture beyond Bubble 691 of 
Metro- East. 

It was Friday night, and Norm 
w as looking forward to the political 
meeting. As he sealed his alumalloy 



72 



suit, he noticed some oldstyle 
letters that seemed to be flashing in 
the night sky just below the 'moon. 
Norm knew what they were because 
he had studied letter-reading to ful- 
fill a requirement for his M agister’s 
degree in Stonyculture. TAKE 
RONNIE TO TRA MWAY36AAT 
24:00, the stray message flashed. 
“Don’t know anyone named 
Ronnie,’’ Norm said aloud. He 
\\ondered if he should request a 
transceiver circuit-check, since 
Mom had been behaving erratically 
lately. He pushed the tramway 
button and waited. 

The political party was in Corn- 
room 4, two levels up and four sec- 
tions west. Norm would be there in 
less than an hour, he figured, 
barring a chainbreak or a tramjam. 
He checked his CL24 digit, set for 
six hours tlopleave every weekend 
and tramway to any pubplace in 
Bubble 691 — except the Mayor and 
other exec thinktanks. The tram 
arrived and opened . 

AN OLD man in a rumpled busi- 
ness suit trudged along a 
pitted macadam road toward the 
lighthouse, his body hunched for- 
ward, his hands hanging almost to 
his knees. Shouts and laughter 
penetrated the roar of the surf; 
waited for the youngsters climbing 
the scarp from the beach sixty feet 
below. It was a warm July evening, 
the sun still half an hour high. 
Three, five, eight naked bodies 



scrambled onto the dune top. They 
pulled up abruptly when they 
spotted Cal, the old man, and 
nodded to him in a half-hearted 
gesture of respect. 

“Norma, Supper Service to- 
night — come along.’’ 

“Yes, Father Witch,’’ she re- 
plied, separating herself from the 
others. The two walked toward the 
lighthouse. The kids walked across 
the road and then, laughing, hur- 
ried to Lovelane. 

Norma climbed the steel ladder 
and pushed through the hatch into 
the cage. In the dark she found the 
acety'ene inlet-line cock, opened it, 
it the pilot flame in the lamp. 
When the big light ignited she re- 
moved the bar from the spokes of 
the sprocket wheel, and as the links 
of the weighted chain engaged the 
sprocket the light began to revolve. 
She listened to the familiar scratch 
of the chain as the light played 
upon the multiprismed lens. 

When she returned to the galley. 
Cal was pouring coffee through a 
strainer. On the table lay an open 
volume of the Annals of Tacitus. 
The lighthouse was stocked with a 
seemingly inexhaustible supply of 
Martinson’s coffee, Chivas Regal 
and editions of classical texts. 

“Ten minutes to curtain,’’ Cal 
said. 

“You’ve been in the radio room 
nearly an hour.” 

“A lot of news tonight,’’ Cal 
said. “You were right about Ron. 
They found him about fifteen miles 



73 




down the beach.” 

“Dead?” 

“Very.” 

“Stupid.” Norma blinked back 
tears. “Stupid to pull lobster traps 
in that fog. He didn’t know which 
way to swim.” 

“Something odd about all this 
and about the radio. I’ll tell you 
about it later, after the show. Now 
bring the fish.” 

The beacon of Nauset Light, 
flashing in the night sky, 
summoned the Stonies to the 
Supper Service. Arriving in couples 
and family groups from what had 
once been vacation cottages and 
summer homes, they seated them- 
selves in a semicircle about the 
driftwood fire. They wore skirts of 
salt grass and sea lettuce, necklaces 
of mollusk shell, bracelets of sea- 
polished pebbles. Norma walked 
out of the lighthouse first, cere- 
monially clad in a white cotton 
dress. She placed the striped bass 
on the fire. Cal, who had followed 
her, stepped forward into the 
center of the circle and intoned the 
familiar ritual: 

Our land is named for a fish 
Out of the sea we have come 
From the sea we are fed 
May we feed forever on its 
mystery 

Out of death has come life — 

The waters turned black 
Death piled upon the sand and 
stank 

The flies came bringing plague 



And the men died turning black 
in turn 

Those who fled are the living 
dead 

Tomorrow belongs to the sea 
people 

And to those who are dreamers 
of dreams 

Father Witch in heaven 

Deliver us from evil omens 

“There will be a heavy fog to- 
morrow morning,” Cal continued 
in his ordinary voice. “It will burn 
off before noon. One of the Gibson 
girls in Gonquet has had quad- 
ruplets — two girls and two boys. 
The raiding party has returned to 
Metro. It’s safe to move back to the 
bay side. Two Metromen will arrive 
in a small copter later tonight or to- 
morrow. Do not kill them. This is 
important. Bring them to the light- 
house. They won’t be armed . .” 

After the service Norma sat alone 
under the stars and stared into the 
embers of the fire. The children 
were peaceful except for^H'ab who 
was cold and uneasy. Sleep, sleep, 
my child, she said to the uneasiness 
in her mind. Then her other self 
was in a room full of people dressed 
in the metal clothes of Metromen. 
One of them, whose back was to 
her, had a familiar posture. When 
he turned, Norma saw he was Ron. 
He recognized her and seemed 
equally astonished. 

“Norma.” a voice called from the 
darkness. Not Ron’s voice. She 
stood up but said nothing. 



74 



GALAXY 




“Norma,” the voice came again, 
closer. She could make out Garth’s 
ligure and the feathered bonnet of 
I he Cosgard commune chief. 
“Norma, come with me.” 

“You have your own women.” 
“Ron is dead and I’m in his 
l)lace. How long are you going to 
stay with the old man?” he said, 
moving closer. 

“Be careful, now . 

“Listen, 1 come here for the 
weather reports,, that’s all.” 

Garth made her uneasy. 

“You owe me your thanks, at 
least,” he said. 

“For what?” 

“For your life.” 

“You killed those two for spite. 
It had nothing to do with me.” 
“One for spite, perhaps. The 
other Metroman was about to kill 
you.” 

“That's absurd. Why would he 
want to kill me? And why would he 
use a spear-fishing gun?” 

“Absurd, yes. But true.” 

“Leave the girl in peace,” Cal’s 
rusty voice echoed from the dark- 
ness. 

“Of course. Father Witch,” 
Garth answered. They did not con- 
fuse Cal with God. Only with the 
godhead. Many times he had tried 
to straighten them out before giving 
up on it and just answering to the 
name. “Father Witch, I would not 
harm her.” 

B ecause of a tramjam Norm was 
pretty late for the political 



meeting. It was in full swing when 
he arrived. The party leader, who 
would be up for Transformation 2 
next month, met him at the tram- 
way. The voting had not yet.^begun. 
Political posters saluted Norm as he 
entered thecomroom, electronically 
advocating candidates for the 691 
election. Norm was not particularly 
interested, the office at stake, that 
of Senator, being merely a stepping 
stone for politicos. He just wanted 
the voting over with, since he was 
scheduled for a Project Assign- 
ment. Looking around the room, 
he recognized a few colleagues he 
had already met in person and a 
number of others he had worked 
with on screen. 

“Please be seated,” a metallic 
voice requested. Norm slid into an 
unoccupied voting machine. The 
screen dilated, presenting the ten 
issues. 

As usual in local elections most 
of the issues were Metro concerns, 
affairs with which the candidates, if 
elected, would have little to do: the 
Energy Rights Defensive Reaction 
with Metro-Central — philosophical 
differences about future bio- 

types — policy toward Stonies and 
other primitive life forms. Only to- 
ward the bottom of the list did the 
issues become relevant: the 

question of ilopleave and tram- 
jams; the mounting problems of 
asphyxiation and the Quality of 
Life. 

Norm favored maintaining the 
two sexes and about at the present 



WITCH CHILDREN 



75 




ratio, and maintaining a variety of 
bio-types as well, at least until re- 
search proved conclusively that 
these differences were natural. 

As each of the issues was pre- 
sented he inserted his right index 
finger — the CL24 digit — into a 
socket on a six-point scale, indi- 
cating his degree of approval and 
disapproval. After he had gone 
through the ten issues, the screen 
indicated the order of his prefer- 
ences for the candidates — 3, 2, 4, 
1, as it happened. As the results 
came in he saw that 3 had no 
chance, so he switched to 2. He 
watched the flickering numbers as 
they mounted and was pleased with 
himself when the arrow came on 
indicating that 2 had won. Upon 
identification. Norm was surprised 
to discover the winner was Karl 
524, a cybrosport scholar he had 
been working with on a project they 
had just completed. 

According to the con-circ screen, 
Norm had a few minutes before his 
appointment with his Project 
Director. While selecting an N -cap- 
sule from the buffet table — it was a 
dinner meeting — Norm felt some- 
one’s eyes on him. 

No, not eyes exactly, he mentally 
amended. A mind. The mind of a 
girl. She was sitting by the embers 
of a fire under the night sky. 

Norm experienced her astonish- 
ment. He turned and saw her. The 
alumalloy suit was incongruous but 
the features were right. A shock of 
recognition flashed from the base 



of his spine and struck somewhere 
in the back of his head. It was not 
an unpleasant sensation, nor half 
so disturbing as the situation: a 
dream, one that bothered him be- 
cause of its consistency, was walk- 
ing directly toward him. 

“Ron?” she asked. 

“No, I’m Norm.” 

“Veronica.” Something about 
the name rang a bell. Veronica? 
Ronnie, for short. He realized her 
name should be Norma. 

“You know about the light- 
house?” he asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Ever been there?” 

“No.” 

“But you’ve studied Stonycul- 
ture, watched tapes ...” 

“No.” 

“I’m afraid we’ve been having 
the same dream.” 

“Do you know about the chil- 
dren?” 

“Yes,” Norm answered, and for 
the moment he could feel those 
small-body comforts and anxieties. 
His attention was diverted by the 
appointment screen. “We’ll have to 
talk later,” he said. “1 have a 
project appointment right now.” 
“We. I believe. You and 1 have 
been teamed up.” 

As they walked toward Project 
Director S, the situation. Norm 
felt, had begun to make some 
sense. He and Veronica were the 
subjects of a psychological experi- 
ment, and the entire matter would 
be cleared up immediately. 



76 



GALAXY 




Project Director S, who specializ- 
ed in Interdisciplinary Research, 
had been elected to and had sur- 
vived the Fifth Transformation. He 
was built into his office equipment. 
Were it not for his sense of humor, 
conferring with S would be much 
like talking to an unoccupied room. 

S’s door opened as they ap- 
proached, closed behind them. 
They sat at the conference console. 
Norm placed his palm down on the 
console so that his digit met the 
identification lock. Norm X, the 
electronic read-out announced. 
Assistant Professor of Anthropol- 
ogy. Specialty: Contemporary At- 
lantic Stonyculture. Transforma- 
tions. none ...” 

“Forget the formalities,” S an- 
nounced in a polyphonic voice. “I 
know both of you quite well. In 
fact. I’ve been going over your 
tapes.” 

“The project is important, 
then,” Norm said. He spoke to the 
clock on the wall, following the 
sweep of the second hand with his 
eyes. The face showed 23:46. 

“It’s unusual, to say the least. 
But before we get to it I have a few 
questions. Have you two ever met 
before?” 

“Just in the comroom tonight.” 
“Never before, in person or on 
screen.” 

“. No.” 

“Why the hesitation?” 

“Oh,” Norm answered, “I felt 
a certain ... 1 don’t know how to 
put it. It was as if we had indeed 



met somewhere before.” 

“Go on.” 

SAY NOTHING. A command. 
Veronica had received it too. Norm 
could tell, because for an instant he 
seemed to be into her mind. 

“Interesting. Can you explain 
why you felt that way?” 

“Not really. Deja vu, perhaps.” 

“And you, Veronica, did you feel 
the same way?” 

“1 felt nothing at all,” she lied. 
Norm recalled her astonishment, 
mixed as it was with a deep ur- 
gency. Just then he realized that the 
urgency had sprung from sexual 
attraction. But that was impos- 
sible, almost natural! 

“Anyw'ay, to get on with it,” S 
continued, “you have been assign- 
ed to a classified project. The desig- 
nation indicates it will deal with 
Stonyculture but there are no 
specifics. You are to embark on a 
sputtercraft — presumably, you will 
receive instructions in transit. 
There will be no enforcers — not 
even a pilot. You will go tomorrow, 
alone.” 

“But I can’t fly a sputtercraft,” 
Norm said, confused. 

“That’s the least of it. Why send 
a computer technician like Veron- 
ica to a place where there are no 
computers?” 

“Perhaps,” Norm suggested, his 
prior idea surfacing, “we’re the 
subject of an experiment.” 

“A thought. But as Project 
Director I would have been inform- 
ed. In this case, though, just about 



WITCH CHILDREN

everything has been relayed 
through a security bank.” 

‘‘.Any reason to think we’re 
guinea pigs?” 

‘‘You two are genetically ... re- 
lated. And there are some other 
oddities or coincidences.” 

‘‘About us?” 

‘‘Well, there’s another project 
that apparently ties in. It has to do 
with rearing children. Three of the 
subjects are in the same genetic line 
as you two. And since the time 
those three were put together, most 
of the reports override me and I 
can’t even guess what’s going on. 
The researchers have asked for 
maximum security status. Day be- 
fore yesterday, on their recommen- 
dation, a full squadron of enforcers 
was sent to Cape Cod. Does any of 
that mean anything to you?” 

‘‘Not really. It might tie in, 
though, as you say.” 

‘‘Well, without further informa- 
tion I can’t let you go tomorrow. It 
would be suicide.” 

‘‘I’d prefer more information 
myself.” 

‘‘Yes. One more thing. You’ve 
worked with Karl 524?” 

‘‘We’ve just finished a project.” 
‘‘Something to do with games, I 
believe?” 

‘‘We did a comparative analysis 
of cybroball and a game the Stonies 
call scrimmage, 7'hey’re both de- 
rived from football, an aggressive 
tribal ritual that the ancients . .” 
‘‘Yes, I recall your tapes. Pub- 
lished in Access Level 22, weren’t 



they? Congratulations. And now 
this Karl is a Senator.” 

‘‘You believe that ties in. too?” 
‘‘I don’t know. Maybe it’s a case 
of Fifth Transformation paranoia. 
You’ll hear from me as soon as I get 
more data.” The clock had stopped 
at 23:55. 

As they made their way through 
the comroom. Norm avoided his 
Conversation Circle. ‘‘We have an- 
other appointment,” he said, lead- 
ing Ronnie to the tramway. 

‘‘Who with?” 

‘‘Damned if I know, but it’s right 
here and in half a minute.” 

First the lights went out. Amid 
the confusion in the comroom 
Norm could hear components 
shutting down. Then came the 
acrid smell of overloaded circuits, a 
series of Hashes, splattering 
sounds. The tramway whisked open 
and Ronnie stepped into its lighted 
cubicle. ‘‘Quick,” she said, ‘‘before 
we’re spotted.” 

R eaching the third deck, Norma 
found Cal seated on the old sofa 
drinking a large glass of whiskey 
and looking more than usually for- 
lorn. 

‘‘I’ll dim the light,” Norma said. 
‘‘Leave it.” 

‘‘It’s nearly midnight.” 

‘‘Leave it on. I’ve been told to 
leave it on.” 

‘‘Told? What do you mean? Are 
you sure you’re not drunk?” 

‘‘I’m not drunk now, but I will be 
in about an hour. I think it was a 



78

computer. 1 don’t like getting 
orders from a machine.” 

Norma sat down and poured her- 
self a drink. ‘‘It has to do with the 
raiding party, the one we’re not to 
kill.” 

‘‘1 suppose it does.” 

‘‘Cal, you’ve always been secre- 
tive and laconic . .” SAY NO- 
THING, the voice commanded — 
and Norma was her other self, 
sitting with Ron in a room with a 
clock and hearing mechanical 
noises. 

‘‘What’s wrong, Norma?” Cal 
sipped whiskey. ‘‘Speak up.” 

‘‘It’s time for you to talk. There 
are a number of people running 
around in my head. You must tell 
me — who are they? Who am I?” 
“‘You are the wonderful child 
who came from the sky.” 

‘‘Stop it. Cal. please.” 

He paused. ‘‘Sorry. Twenty-odd 
years ago a copter from Metro 
landed out front. The pilot pre- 
sented me with a baby girl. Said re- 
searchers wanted to find out about 
the difference between children 
raised here and those raised in 
Metro. We were short of 
children — and you were a wonder- 
ful child.” 

‘‘Then I’m not really your daugh- 
ter. And my mother . .” 

‘‘What I told you about your 
mother — my wife — is true. She 
died in the plague. We used to 
come here every summer. The 
cottage you call Lovelane was our 
place.” 



‘‘Is she buried there?” 

‘‘No. We got out as soon as the 
plague broke. A colleague of mine 
flew us to Boston-Cambridge, one 
of the complexes bubbled over even 
then. Both of them died.” 

‘‘So you returned.” 

‘‘There was no point in staying. 
I’d been thinking of leaving the 
university, anyway. You see, what I 
taught no longer interested any- 
one.” 

‘‘Those old books?” 

‘‘Books. With reading going out 
of style, it became futile to expect 
young people to pore over texts in 
languages that hadn’t been spoken 
for a thousand years. That hit me 
hard. In those days I believed every 
answer worth knowing and every 
question worth asking could be 
found in those books.” Cal sighed. 
‘‘I’m getting maudlin. Must be the 
scotch.” 

‘‘What was it like, when you re- 
turned?” 

‘‘Everyone dead or gone. In a few 
months new people started to arrive 
— groups of kids, a couple of fami- 
lies. But till they came I was Adam 
with more work to do than naming 
the animals — fiddling with gasoline 
engines, getting a generator work- 
ing, things like that. A humbling 
experience for an academic.” 
“Why did you move into the 
lighthouse?” 

“There was the radio, and the 
light is the soundest structure 
around. Anyway, there’s something 
about a lighthouse. For a few years

I talked with hams all over New 
England. Then they revoked ama- 
teur licenses and Metro began to 
treat us the way they do now.” Cal 
reached into his vest, took out his 
brass pocket-watch. “Just about 
midnight,” he said. “Time to get 
back to the radio room for more 
orders.” 

“What makes you think it’s a 
computer.” 

“Computer voice. Also it talks to 
me over the radio in Latin hexa- 
meters — in the style of Virgil. 1 
don’t suppose anyone alive can 
speak classical Latin. Ironic — I 
once used to think of myself read- 
ing from those ‘old books’ to my 
children and grandchildren. But 
only computers understand classi- 
cal languages nowadays.” 

Then Norma was pressed up 
against the other Ron in a tight 
windowless compartment that 
jostled and clanked as it moved. 

THERE is the tram headed?” 
Ronnie asked. 

“Seems to be going down, and 
toward Bubble Center,” Norm re- 
plied. 

“How did you know about the 
tram?” 

“Mom — my transceiver — sent a 
message before I left the flop to- 
night. It didn’t make sense at the 
time.” 

“S wasn’t much help.” 

“Why did you lie to him about 

“For the same reason you were 



evasive. There’s a struggle going 
on, I’m sure — a power struggle of 
some sort.” 

“How do you know what side 
we’re on? It may only be some kind 
of reaction test.” 

“I don’t think so, no. And I trust 
the voice.” 

lUPPITER ILLA PIAE/SEC-

time weak and attenuated though 
echoing in a rough bass. Ronnie 
shut it off, realizing the message 
was not meant for her or Norm. 

The tram, which had been clank- 
ing along at the unusual speed of 
almost 30 klicks, screeched to a 
halt. When the door opened they 
found themselves looking into the 
brain of Bubble 691 — Admin

Norm and Ronnie hurried into

“Okay,” Norm replied. “Let’s do

The instructions now on the wall- 
screen were mostly for Ronnie. 
They involved programing and 
sabotaging the central computer. 

“If they were after us before, 
they really have reasons now. We 
seem to be carrying out a political 
assassination.” 

“The Mayor will survive,”

Ronnie answered. “He’ll be doing 
things he won’t know about and 
he’ll have forgotten a lot, but he’ll 
survive. That takes care of instruc- 
tions one through nine.’’ 

“Ten 1 can follow myself,’’ Norm 
replied. It read simply: RETURN 
TO TRAMWAY. 

The tram traveled straight up for 
more than ten minutes, then level- 
ed off, headed due east. When it 
stopped and opened. Norm and 
Ronnie were peering into a large 
bleak hangar with its hatchway 
open to the sky. It was empty ex- 
cept for a lone sputtercraft. They 
walked across the hangar, footfalls 
echoing metallically in the vast 
chamber. “I suppose we get in,’’ 
Norm said, opening the cockpit. He 
sat down in the pilot’s seat. “What 
now?’’ 

“We fly to the lighthouse,’’ 
Ronnie backed into the adjoining 
seat. 

“But I don’t know . .’’Sudden- 
ly Norm discovered he did know 
how to operate the sputtercraft. He 
could read the instruments and 
gauges. He understood even the 
mechanism of the internal combus- 
tion engine that drove the rotary 
blades. Then he felt eyes on him 
and a mind. Turning, he saw three 
small faces staring at him through 
the glass panel that separated the 
cockpit from the crew station. 
“Those must be the Y’s on that 
chart.” 

“Yes,” Ronnie replied. “The 
children . our children.” 



C AL was telling Norma that the 
radio signal was unusual in a 
number of ways. “It’s on all fre- 
quences for one thing,” he said, 
turning the tuning dial. The mes- 
sage came in a mechanical 
cadence. lUPPlTER ILLA PIAE

“What does it mean?” 

“Jupiter — God, I suppose we 
would say today — set these coasts 
apart for a manly race when he 
alloyed the golden age with bronze 
and hardened the bronze age with 
iron, from which a happy flight is 
granted to the pious, according to 
prophesy.” 

“That sounds good for the sea 
people, as you call us,” Norma 
commented. PROBABLE DURA- 
TION OF PRIMAR Y O VERRIDE

voice as that coming over the radio, 
but it was faint and far away in her 
mind. Norma ignored it. 

“It’s from Horace,” Cal explain- 
ed. “From a poem lamenting 
Rome’s self-destruction.” 

“So, Metro is destroying itself?” 
“That would be . interesting.

hidden,’ whose growth had been 
cut off in the womb. Another pre- 
diction of the fall of Metro, if that’s 
what the computer is telling us. 
What’s wrong, Norma?” 

He had seen she was not listen- 
ing, was concentrating on some- 
thing else. THEY MEAN TO KILL 
YOU, the voice inside her head was 
saying. 

“Give me something to write on. 
Cal — quick!” 

He handed her a stub of a pencil, 
looked for paper. “Dammit,” he 
said. “Write on the wall.” 
Sh«^wrote:

“Ronnie is what I used to call my

to be just a dream, but it’s getting 
stronger.” 

“Is there anything else?” 
“Another diagram. I can remem-

“Well, I’m X’O, and Ron is 
X’O^ . That’s the date he died, July 
8. They killed Ron — Garth was 
right. They were trying to kill me.” 
“Quadruplets!” Cal blurted. 
“That explains it.” 



“Explains what?” 

“Why they would save premature 
children born to a woman dying of 
the plague. Two sets of identical 
twins — ideal subjects for the re- 
search they were interested in.” 
“Your wife?” 

“Yes, your mother. She died on 
July 21, 1982, just as the diagram 
says.” 

All was becoming clearer. Not 
only the meaning of the diagrams 
but the minds of the others. In the 
other mental chamber, the one with 
the copter, the impulses were 
stronger than they had ever been. 
She knew Norm’s confusion and 
then his understanding of the air- 
craft, felt the hesitant liftoff, the 
initial uncertainty of the flight, and 
then she saw the nighttime sky and 
its myriad stars with eyes of 
wonder. Behind the lifting craft, 
the immense hemispheres ofMetro- 
East were diminishing to an ebony 
honeycomb that glowed with a cold 
phosphorescence. 

“They’re coming here. Norm, 
Ronnie and the children.” 

“To the lighthouse?” 

“Yes, in a copter.” 

“1 see. That’s why we left the 
light on. Well, there seems to be 
nothing to do but wait, and have 
another drink.” 

I T WAS a harrowing flight. Norm 
sat tensely at the stick, eyes glued 
to the altimeter, overcompensating 
for every roll, pitch and yaw. The 
twenty minutes of flying time 



WITCH CHILDREN

stretched to an eternity before he 
spotted the swirling beam of the 
light. Once in view, the light 
lurched toward them. When they 
were within a thousand meters of it, 
Norm hovered the craft and began 
to descend. It hit sooner and much 
harder than he expected. He felt 
stunned and dizzy. An old man 
with hair on his head led them to 
the lighthouse. 

Inside, in what the old man. Cal, 
had called the galley. Norm sat un- 
comfortably at the table, staring in 
horror at the red corpse of a crus- 
tacean on his plate and trying to 
avoid thinking about the evil-smell- 
ing liquid he had been cheerfully 
handed and was apparently expect- 
ed to drink. Seated across from 
Norm, Cal ripped open a steaming 
bivalve and stuffed its gray carcass 
into his mouth. “Eat something,” 
he said, “You must be starving.” 

“No, thank you,” Norm replied, 
watching with disgust Cal’s carni- 
vorous teeth making short work of 
the quahog. Norm knew that the 
Stonies ate fish, flesh and fowl, but 
knowledge is not experience. He 
also realized that the hollow feeling 
in his stomach and the lightness in 
his head were hunger. But nature, 
he had been taught, was something 
that had been overcome. It was 
then he realized that Cal was hav- 
ing fun at his expense. “It will be 
all right,” the old man laughed. 
“Your aversion to food is chemi- 
cally induced. It will wear off.” 

“You’re sure about that?” 



“We’ve had some experience 
with Metropeople. It takes a couple 
of days. You have a few other 
surprises coming.” 

Norm felt a twinge of concern 
and realized that Norma was 
worried about the children. Both 
women had been trying to get some 
response out of them. “What’s 
wrong?” he asked. 

“They won’t say a word. And 
they just sit there,” she replied. 

“Is that unusual?” 

“It ... is ... all right,” the eld- 
est child said hesitantly. She was 
about seven. “Speak . ingisdiffi- 
cult ... for . us.” THIS IS 
EASIER. 

Norm felt the blast of “sound” 
thunder in his head. Everyone but 
the children had instinctively cover- 
ed their ears with their hands. 
“You better just talk, or turn that 
down,” Cal said. 

“Sor . ry.” 

“I’ll ... do . it,” the boy 
said, talking to Norma and then 
climbing the ladder. He was about 
five years old. 

“Do what?” 

“Turn off . the . light.” 

“It can be dangerous,” Norma 
said. 

“1 only . have to close . 
inlet-line valve,” the little boy, Jon, 
answered, and the others laughed 
at his assurance. 

“The boy has been picking your 
brains. He’ll do all right,” Cal re- 
plied. Turning to Nell, the oldest, 
he continued. “Tell us about the

experiment — about Metro.” 

“It is . compli . cated to 
say.” /I ROOM WITHOUT WIN- 
DOWS. Cal saw the blank walls 
the transparent plastic cubicles, the 
overhead devices that fed the chil- 
dren. He saw the blank stares of the 
others and felt the dreamlike 
warmth aglow in Nell’s mind. 

“The others?” 

“Went . crazy.” 

“But you?” 

“I knew about . my mothers 
and fathers.” 

“So Metro was trying to raise 
children without human contact, 
and these survived because they 
had a mental contact with you. But 
what happened?” 

“On . ly we sur . vived.” 
BECAME SUSPICIOUS. THEIR 
OBSERVATIONS PROVED WE

“So that’s why you were so hesi-

“They . blundered.” PUT US

“That’s why it got so much 
stronger!” Norma said. 

Ronnie added, “These kids must 
be genetically identical, practically. 
1 suppose they aeted as a catalyst — 
that would explain how Norm and I 
knew about the lighthouse.” 

“It explains everything else, as 



well,” Cal added, “ — except why 
the computer at Metro is on our 
side.” 

“We’ll think about that to- 
morrow,” Norma said. “The 
children are tired. It’s two a.m.” 
Tab. the three-year old, had fallen 
asleep. So had Norm . 

Next morning two of the children 
were gone. 

Norm was the first to awake, 
from an uneasy sleep, and he knew 
immediately that they were missing. 
It did not alarm him. The two had 
left Tab, the little girl, behind. 
Across the room, on a sofa, he saw 
a figure under a coverlet. The bald 
head told him it was Ronnie. He 
felt his own scalp and realized, with 
a touch of squeamishness, that 
without an autobarber he would 
grow hair on his head and face. 

Norm began to make breakfast. 
It was easy, he discovered, as long 
as he did not try to think about it. 
His hands knew where the eggs 
were and how much butter to dab 
in the warming skillet. They knew 
how to break the eggs and beat 
them with a fork. They knew how 
much soft cheese to grate upon the 
sizzling eggs in the pan and when to 
fold the omelet in tw^o. They knew 
all of these things familiarly, but 
his mind was still revolted by the 
thought of actually eating it. 

Suddenly the knowledge in his 
hands was obliterated. In its place 
seethed a horror, a horror he recog- 
nized as part of the strangeness of 
Norma’s mind, but amplified be- 



WITCH CHILDREN 



85 




yond belief. It was the ferocity of a 
beast ready to spring. He heard her 
bare feet on the ladder and turned 
to see her jump the last three steps. 
“Quickly,” she said. “The chil- 
dren!” 

“They can take care of them- 
selves, can’t they?” 

“Maybe they can, maybe not.” 
Into the horror, which had abated, 
came a stream of images. Wild- 
looking men in animal skins, hunt- 
ing with spears, butchering 
children. 

“But that’s a myth,” he said with 
scholarly conviction. The notion of 
hunting animals was revolting 
enough. To hunt people . Never- 
theless he zipped up his suit and 
followed Norma as she hurried 
down the ladder to the next deck. 

She ran at a steady pace north 
along the macadam road. He 
followed at her heels knowing, as 
she did, where the two children 
were. It was an exhilarating experi- 
ence for Norm to run the first 
hundred yards; then suddenly he 
felt exhausted. His lungs protested. 
Sweat seemed to fill his suit. He 
stopped to catch his breath and 
strip off the alumalloy. She had 
passed beyond the crest of a dune 
and w as out of view. Norm decided 
to walk briskly. 

At first a bath of balmy warmth, 
the sun became painful to his skin. 
Its brilliance blazed in his eyes, 
forcing Norm to squint. The roar of 
the surf beat in his head like a 
drum. Even the salt smell — so plea- 



sant in Atmosphere 32 — became 
painfully intense. The beach grass 
and pine shrubbery cut and 
whipped his legs and occasional 
whiffs of bayberry made him dizzy. 
Norm kept his eyes on the path 
directly before him, unwilling to 
yield to the spasms of nausea 
brought on by glimpses into the 
abyss of blue sky. But when he felt 
Norma’s alarm — anger mingled 
with fear — he forced himself to 
look up. He saw' a compound of un- 
painted weathered cottages on the 
slope of cultivated hill. Then the 
ground rose and struck his face and 
shoulders. 

w CAME for the children,” 
Norma said. 

“1 don’t care why you came. 
You’re here, and you’re staying 
here with me,” Garth answered. 

“Where are they?” 

“The kids? They’ve been hang- 
ing around the hospital since they 
arrived. What’s wrong with them? 
They haven’t said a word.” 

“Nothing’s wrong with them. 
They escaped from Metro last 
night.” 

“If they mean so much to you, 
you can have them. They can stay, 
too.” 

“I’m not staying.” 

“Grow up, Norma. You were to 
be Ron’s woman. He’s dead and 1 
rule at the commune now. The best 
women belong to the strongest 
men.” 

“1 have a man.” 



86 



GALAXY 




Garth laughed. “We’ll see about 
(hat.’’ 

There was a knock at the door 
and a warrior entered. His shoul- 
der-length hair was tied with a 
Inaided band. Like Garth, he wore 
a leather loincloth and sandals. 
“We’ve found someone,’’ he said, 
placing his shotgun on a rack. 

“Why bother me? Take what he 
doesn’t need, feed him, and send 
liim on his way.’’ 

“You should look at this one. 
Garth.’’ 

“Bring him. then.’’ 

Two women helped Norm into 
(he room and sat him down on a 
wicker chair. 

“Well, what have we here?’’ 
Garth said. “Ron’s ghost? It looks 
like Ron three days dead.’’ 

“It’s his brother, his twin 
brother,’’ Norma explained. “He 
escaped from Metro last night, 
also.’’ 

“The skin is as white as a fish’s 
belly. Is this your man, then?’’ 
Garth laughed and Norm was 
furious. “Can it speak?” 

Norma sent the proper reply. 
Norm nodded. “Thank you for 
your hospitality. Garth, leader of 
the Cosgard commune. Whatever is 
in my power 1 will do for you and 
yours.” 

“He not only speaks, but with a 
civil tongue. Still, what can you do, 
Metroman?” 

THE DIGIT. It was the same 
commanding voice Norma and 
Norm had heard several times the 



night before. Now it was accom- 
panied by a wave of electronic 
music and resonances of the chil- 
dren’s consciousness. She turned to 
Norm to see his reaction. 

“Watch that weapon,” he said, 
pointing with his right hand at the 
shotgun. The stock turned black 
and crumbled into ashes. The 
metal melted. 

“Another witch?” Garth asked, 
glancing at Norma. “1 thought one 
was enough.” His eyes returned to 
Norm. “Do you expect to frighten 
me with a trick, Metroman?” 
HELP MARY. 

“I’ll help Mary,” Norm said, 
feeling the minds of the children 
reaching for his. 

“Clairvoyant, too,” Garth said, 
“Maybe I can help,” Norm re- 
peated unconvincingly. 

As the three of them made their 
way toward the hospital, Norma 
observed the work going on in the 
commune complex. Men were 
hewing pine rafters and splitting 
cedar shingles. Two women were 
planing cabinets. A pumper that 
still advertised the Eastham Volun- 
teer Fire Department was lifting 
water into the central tank. 

From the outside the hospital 
looked like the other cottages. The 
interior, however, except for a 
washroom, consisted of a single 
large chamber. A row of beds ex- 
tended along each wall, barracks 
style. A young woman lay asleep on 
the first bed. The two children were 
sitting on the second, staring with 



WITCH CHILDREN 



87 




blank eyes into the jerry-rigged crib 
between the beds. Norma looked 
into the crib and saw four tiny 
diapered babies. 

“Two girls and two boys,” Garth 
said. 

Norm bent over the crib and 
touched the infants. The older chil- 
dren continued to stare into the 
crib and Norma felt her mind ex- 
pand in a surge of electronic 
counterpoint. It radiated knowl- 
edge, power, will — all directed at 
the tiny bodies in the crib, at their 
lungs, at the budding alvioli. 

Like the children. Norm stared. 

“They’ll live,” he said, after a 
while. 

“1 see they are indeed breathing 
easier, Metroman. I’ll be at head- 
quarters. When you’re through 
here, join me and we’ll share a 
bottle of wine.” 

As soon as Garth had closed the 
screen door, Norma asked, “How 
did you do it — the shotgun, the 
babies?” 

“1 didn’t.” 

“Who did, then?” 

“Mom, 1 suppose.” 

F rom where Ronnie sat on the 
beach, the Nauset Light half a 
mile away looked like a stray white 
rook from a titanic chess set. The 
metaphor, she knew, was Cal’s. He 
was thirty steps down the beach, 
surf fishing, and had just hooked a 
striper. Tab was playing in the 
sand. It had been an anxious morn- 
ing for them all, but now the turbu- 



lence in her head was still. When 
Cal netted the fish, he called to her, 
“Lunchtime. They will be back 
soon.” 

“Good,” she answered. “I’m 
starved.” Breakfast had been diffi- 
cult but lunch, Ronnie knew, 
would be no trouble at all. She 
pulled the straw hat over her ears, 
wrapped the heavy olive-drab 
blanket about her shoulders, 
staggered through the resistant 
sand toward the scarp. Cal followed 
with Tab on his shoulders. 

Ronnie was relieved to escape 
from the terrors of the beach, the 
walls of foaming blue-green water 
that pounded the surf, the bizarre 
antics of sandpipers, terns and 
shrieking gulls, the clean corrup- 
tion of wrecked crabs, mussels, and 
clams, the saline purity of drift- 
wood, sea grapes and other jetsam. 
It would be comforting to be out of 
the sun and within the enclosure of 
the lighthouse. 

When Ronnie reached the galley. 
Cal was preparing the bass. “Any- 
thing 1 can do?” she asked. 

“Why don’t you amuse Tab.” 
“She’s busy.” 

“What’s she up to?” 

“Reading.” 

“Reading!” 

“Something wrong?” 
“Three-year-olds don’t usually 
read before lunch. What so fas- 
cinates her?” 

“One of your books.” 

Cal slid the pan into the broiler. 
“That I’d like to see,” he said.

walking toward the ladder. 

Tab lay on the sofa, poring over a 
large volume. 

“Like the book?’’ Cal asked. 
"It’s difficult.’’ 

“In what way?’’ 

“1 know what it says but not 
what it means.’’ 

“Show me.’’ 

“Here,” Tab said, pointing to a 
passage. “What did he do that’s so 
terrible?” 

“An ancient taboo — against in- 
cest . ’ ’ 

“Is anything wrong?” Ronnie 
asked. She seemed always to expect 
trouble. 

“Nothing. It’s just that she’s 
reading Sophocles — in Greek.” 
“She’s a smart little thing. We 
were doing mathematical puzzles 
this morning. She got the hang in 
no time.” 

“Picking our brains, are you, 
fab?” 

“I don’t think so,” Ronnie inter- 
jected. “She’s way ahead of us. She 
computes faster than I can.” 

“How fast?” 

“Instantaneously. Does it all in 
her head.” 

“Like a computer?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“H’m— interesting.” 

A hatch slammed shut and voices 
could be heard below. “Here they 
come,” Cal said. “Let’s have some 
lunch.” 

Everyone ate in external silence; 
each understood completely what 
the other’s had been doing through- 



out the morning. Internal silence 
too, except for some static coming 
from the children. Norm was trying 
to penetrate the static, but he 
couldn’t. “Tab,” he said casually, 
while Cal poured coffee, “can you 
compute the value of pi to fifty 
places?” 

3.1416 . It was instantaneous- 
ly in Norm’s mind, five lines of ten 
digits. The two older children were 
glowering at Tab. 

“Tab, can you compute pi all the 
way?” 

There was a hesitation, then it 
came. DOES NOT COMPUTE. It 
was Mom. 

“Show-off,” Jon said, scowling 
at Tab. “We agreed not to let them 
know till we were sure.” 

“Sure of what?” Ronnie asked. 

“That we were safe. But it’s all 
right,” Nell soothed. “You’ll be 
able to do it yourselves in a few 
days.” 

“Do what?” 

“Think like the computer.” 

Norm sat back in his chair, and 
looked in turn into innocent dark 
eyes of each of the children. Just 
the same, it w as Ronnie who under- 
stood first. “They must have 
planned the whole thing,” she 
blurted. “The escape from Metro, 
the instructions, our crazy project, 
everything!” 

“And they sent the radio mes- 
sages. In Latin,” Norma added. 

“That’s Mom, then — the three of 
them.” Norm concluded, and all 
the static cleared. ★

EASY RIDER 



An alternate- 

armanth liked the look of the 
mount. It had powerful front 
quarters, a sloping back, long legs. 
The beast was fast.. And big. Short, 
sharp, heavy horns jutted from its 
head. The animal could kill with 
them. And with the thick hoofs. 
Yet its teeth were fit only for graz- 
ing. Its hide was thin. It could be 
prey for a killer. 

Armanth thought: Perhaps they 
did not exaggerate when they said 
Ungar handled the best mounts 
available on any Reservation. The 
creature is dangerous, but it is vul- 
nerable, too. As a good mount 
should be. 

Then he thought: It may dis- 
appoint. There are now so few 
mounts that do not. Now, when 
every fool with a few days to spare 
wants to ride, there are so many 
artless handlers who demean the 
sport by offering dull mounts and 
deathless contests. Numbers cheap- 
en everything. 

“It will do,” he said. “You may 
turn off the viewscreen. I will 
mount when you are ready.” 

“Yes, sir,” Ungar said. 

An hour later, Ungar said, “I 
have one, sir. His crisis is coming. 
Are you ready?” 

“Yes. Help me mount.” 

Armanth entered the creature 
gradually. Muscles. Hide. Nerves. 
He let himself into the animal’s 
senses. Smell, especially smell. The 
animal smelled danger. Cat 
danger. Big cat danger. It snorted 



universe story 

and pawed the ground restlessly. 

Armanth trembled, already part 
animal. He thought: Ungar is 

good. To provide a mount just as it 
begins the heightening that comes 
with danger — that is skill. 

Armanth settled fully into the 
animal. He heard the others of his 
herd moving uneasily near him and 
trotted a few steps closer to them. 
Their smell was reassuring. But 
over it, dominating it, was the cat 
smell. His head turned. He saw the 
cat: huge, tufted head, wide chest, 
long mane. The cat opened its 
mouth and exposed massive teeth. 

It roared. He started and reared 
up on his hind legs. Awkwardly but 
quickly, he ran. The cat smell was 
in his nostrils. 

Then he saw the other cat. It was 
slightly smaller than the beast that 
had roared and had no mane. He 
veered away from the new cat. The 
comforting smell of the others of 
his herd was gone. 

He felt teeth knife into his hind 
leg, cut deeply. Instinctively he 
bucked and kicked backward. The 
teeth were gone. 

He spun clumsily, the wounded 
leg almost folding under him. Head 
lowered, horns only a few inches 
above the ground, he charged. His 
horns caught tlesh. He heard the 
cat howl, smelled blood, saw the 
animal limp away. He snorted in 
triumph. 

Painfully he began to run once 
again, seeking the scent of his herd, 
safety, healing. 



91 




Sudden crushing weight on his 
hindquarters. He tried to turn, felt 
the leg give, fell heavily on his side. 
A grunt of terror spewed from his 
mouth as the cat came briefly into 
his vision, mane flowing, teeth 
bared. He kicked at it with his fore- 
legs, tried to rise. 

Raw pain at his tbroat. Cat smell 
in his nostrils. His head snapped 
back in a reflex spasm. 



ARMANTH came back screaming. 

He opened his eyes, blinked, 
aiTci looked through the window' of 
Ihc satellite at the Reservation 
planet below him. 

“Wonderful!” he said. “De- 
licious. The death was exquisite. 
Riding a victim is much better than 
riding a killer, don’t you think? Not 
that one knows which he will get.” 
He tried to guess which of the con- 
tinents he had been on. 

“Yes. sir,” Ungar said. 

“ fhe victim’s experience is much 
more complex, much richer. What 
was it the Poet said? ‘To fight and 
die is to know life.’” 

“I believe so, sir.” 

Armanth thought: This Ungar is 
a find. A wonderfid mount. And. 
his timing is superb. He must have 
dismounted me only a split second 
before I would have been trapped 
in the creature's final ending. But I 
knew the dying. That is more than 
skill. That is sport that becomes 
art. 

His exhileration faded into slight 
uncertainty. He thought: This was 
only once. Can he do it again? 
Perhaps he was only lucky. 

“Sir.” said Ungar. “1 have an- 
other mount ready.” 



“Oh?” Armanth said. “I usually 
prefer to wait, to savor ...” 

“I appreciate that, sir, but this 
one is something a bit different. 1 
liave one that is almost fully sen- 
tient. We find only a few. They 
generally manage to avoid interest- 
ing crisis-situations.” 

Armanth hesitated. Ungar flick- 
ed on the viewscreen. 

“His appearance is deceptive,” 
Ungar said. “But 1 think you will 
llnd him interesting. If 1 may sug- 
gest that you test him for a 
moment . .” 

Armanth partly entered the 
animal, w ithdrew . 

“ The heightening has begun, as 
you ean see, sir.” Ungar said. “His 
erisis will come slowly, but it is 
good to mount at the beginning.” 
“Yes. 1 have ample time,” Ar- 
manth said, eager now, his uncer- 
tainty gone. So subtle, he thought, 
so subtle this Ungar is. “I will 
mount when you are ready.” 

“Very well.” 

'U'E KNIT his heavy dark 
Ipleyebrows in a scowl as the 
.mclge entered the room, strode to- 
ward the bench. Sweat trickled 
clow II his cheeks. It was the lights 
that were making him sweat. They 
alw ays did, he knew . the miserable 
rv lights, the last smalt indignity 
Ibreed on him by the media that 
had hounded him all his life. He 
brushed away the moisture and 
listened. 

“Senators,” the Chief Justice 
said. “In obedience to your notice. 

1 am present for the purpose of 
forming a Court of Impeachment 
for the President of the United 
Slates.”

AS PROMISED, I here complete my 
report on D. G. Compton’s 
The Unsleeping Eye (DAW, 95 C), 
which I hadn’t finished as the last 
deadline glared at me. It fulfills all 
of its extraordinary promise. The 
little-known, un-trumpeted Comp- 
ton is without doubt one of the 
finest writers-in-depth around. It 
would take a special arrogance, for 
example, or a breath-taking com- 
petence, to dare bringing in a 
major character not twenty pages 
from the end of a book. Since arro- 
gance is not this author’s thing, it 
has to be the other. I read the last 
ten or so pages of this book over 
and over — fifteen or twenty times — 
not because it was hard to grasp, 
but because of the levels which were 
uncovered, one by one, and the 
pleasure it gave me to undergo the 
revelations. 1 have said this before 
about Compton: that it is legiti- 
mate for a writer, even a very good 
writer, to try to make every facet of 
a character clear and every motiva- 
tion understood; but that not real 



person can ever be understood in 
that way, and often his motivations 
spring from that area I call the 
infrarational, which by its nature 
cannot be understood. Compton is 
one of the very few writers who has 
grasped this and who is able to use 
it without clouding anything, and 
therefore his people are, in their 
sayings and doings, unpredictable 
and forever interesting. So take this 
tale of tomorrow’s TV for itself and 
as a fable; read it at its own pace 
and keep it around to read again. 
You’ll be glad you did. 

V OLUME 3, P — Z, of Walt Lee’s 
Reference Guide to Fantastic 
Films: Science Fiction, Fantasy, 
and Horror, is at last in print. This 
completes the first edition and 
basic structure of this monumental 
work. For most of twenty-five 
years Lee, a moonlighting aero- 
space physicist, has labored to pro- 
duce an exhaustive index of fan- 
tastic films. As he worked, the field 
proliferated, and as his research ex- 



93 




panded, he discovered thousands of 
titles he doubtless never suspected 
nor expected when he began. He 
deserves our thanks and support, 
and we must join with him in the 
hope that some foundation will 
undertake to carry the Guide into 
future editions. This final volume 
is, like its predecessors, an 8'/2 x 11 
paperback with photo-reduced type 
and stills which by themselves offer 
a fascinating stepping-stone trip 
through the history of film. The 3rd 
section has an Introduction and 
Afterword by Robert Bloch and 
Forrest J. Ackerman, delights to 
read. The price is a little steep for 
the average buff, but I urge you 
strongly to beg, persuade, ad- 
monish and argue your local library 
to put it in, and to bring it to the 
attention of theater and TV film 
distributors, CATV companies 
which do their own programming, 
and the like. Here are the vital sta- 
tistics: Reference Guide to Fantas- 
tic Films, compiled by Walt Lee. 
Vol 1, A— F, $9.50. Vol. 2, G— O, 
and Vol. 3, P — Z, $9.95 each. 
Total price for the set: $29.40. 
Since the circulation in bookstores 
will be extremely limited, I suggest 
you contact the publisher, Chelsea- 
Lee Books, Box 66273, Los Angeles 
90066. 

And speaking of film, as 1 think 
1 will from time to time, I do wish 
to recommend two to you which you 
might miss if 1 don’t, and that 
would be a serious loss. One is Fan- 
tastic Planet, a feature-length ani- 



mation from Czechoslavakia, beau- 
tifully drawn, and done from a 
novel which I understand was 
written by famed Polish s-f writer 
Stanislaw Lem. I’m sorry I can’t 
give you the details of the produc- 
tion company and distributor; if 
you haven’t seen it and want to, 
you’ll just have to dig. It will be 
worth the effort. Much of the art is 
truly lovely, and the plot, though 
tied together a little hurriedly at the 
end, is really intriguing. The sex is 
mature and the suspense, from 
time to time, nerve-strumming. 

The other is an astonishing and 
poetic film made in Israel, written, 
directed, and generally made-to- 
happen by a human dynamo 
named Richard Shorr. Using un- 
known actors and sensitive, meticu- 
lous photography, it tells the tale of 
a street kid, a sheltered young girl, 
and a strangely gifted youth with 
more-than-natural powers. The 
plot takes an unexpected and pro- 
vocative twist at the end which 
leaves the viewer thoughtful and 
satisfied. The production company 
is Piranha Films, and it’s called 
Once Upon Time. 

I N MY last report to you, you’ll 
have noticed what might be 
called a rave review for Jean Gaw- 
ron’s An Apology for Rain. I not 
only identified the author as female 
but went on to signalize a certain 
type of controlled violence which, I 
said. 1 had noticed before only in 
the works of Ursula le Guin, Jose-

phine Saxton, Marion Zimmer 
Bradley, and Joanna Russ. I went 
on to say that a good writer is a 
good writer regardless of gender, 
and my observation means only 
whatever it means. 

You must know that many of the 
books I review come to me in the 
form of galleys — clusters of yard- 
long (almost) narrow printed 
sheets, or in a later stage, paged, 
printed on both sides, and primly 
bound in heavy paper with nothing 
but the title, pub. date, number of 
pages and author’s name on it. No 
illustrations, jacket copy, or any- 
thing. 1 reviewed the Gawron book 
from one of those, and you can 
imagine my feelings when the hard- 
cover edition came in, complete 
with a four-color jacket and a 
photograph of the author, who has 
about as much claim to being fe- 
male as Richard Burton, I herewith 
explain but do not apologize, and 
retract nothing but the pronoun, 
which 1 correct to ‘he’ and ‘his’. It’s 
a hell of a fine book by a fine new 
writer, and if my bobble puts egg 
on my face, sobeit. An Apology for 
Rain, by Jean Mark Gawron, is 
from Doubleday at $4.95, and well, 
well worth it. 

R umor has it that that extraor- 
dinary sleeper. Another Road- 
side Attraction, by Tom Robbins, 
has gone into a third printing by 
Ballantine, with a blurb on the 
cover quoting me. I haven’t seen it 
but 1 heartily approve. Can’t quote

A paid advertisement in the s-f 
newsletter Locus, by Robert Hein- 
lein, is causing quite a stir. It 
promises The National Rare Blood 
Club, and has an interesting back- 
story. A good part of Heinlein’s / 
Shall Fear No Evil dealt with 
serology, type-matching, rare frac- 
tions and the like, and his interest 
in the subject led him to publish the 
name, address, and hotline phone 
number of the Club on the copy- 
right page of all editions of the 
book. It w as after he did this, when 
gravely ill, his life was saved by five

nameless, faceless donors from the 
National Rare Blood Club, since he 
happens to be a “rare” himself. All 
you have to do to become a member 
is to have a rare type, and then to 
register with the Club. It is a beau- 
tifully selfish thing to do — beautiful 
because you have offered to help, 
any time, anywhere, some stranger 
somewhere who might die if you 
don’t, and selfish because the regis- 
tration may well save your life when 
nothing else could. Though not a 
“rare” myself, I have for a long 
time given blood three or four times 
a year through the Red Cross Blood 
Bank and the Writers Guild, for 
the same beautiful selfish reasons, 
and 1 was really astonished to dis- 
cover, through Heinlein’s ad, that 
up to now there has been no cen- 
tralized agency for the immediate 
dissemination of rare blood. The 
Powers That Be are so remiss in 
their choice of real priorities that I 
was harangued, not long ago, by a 
highw'ay patrolman who objected to 
my writing my blood type in tiny 
letters in the margin of my driver’s 
license — w here 1 thought it belong- 
ed. He said 1 was subject to citation 
for “defacing” it. Anyway, here are 
the needed “rares”; no others 
apply: B pos.; O neg.; A neg.; AB 
pos.; B neg.; and AB neg. As you 
surely know, the pluses and 
minuses refer to the Rh factor, and 
if you don’t know what your type is, 
call your doctor or a convenient 
hospital and find out how to 
discover it for cheap. After that, a 



postcard is sufficient to get you 
going with the National Rare Blood 
Club, 164 Fifth Ave., New York, 
NY 10017. Their hotline is Area 
212, CHelsea 3-8037. No dues, no 
payments — just the good feeling of 
beautiful selfishness. 

B etter get to some books . 

There is, as you know, a rising 
tide of books about s-f, and of an- 
thologies designed for the class- 
rooms. Of the latter, one in par- 
ticular is worth your attention. Not 
only will it succeed in its purpose 
“. to provide the reader un- 
familiar w ith science fiction with an 
orientation in the field, with a large 
body of short fiction which reflects 
the breadth and scope of modern 
science fiction,” as the foreword 
states, but it is also the finest 
across-the-board package of really 
good s-f since the Hall of Fame, a 
meticulously selected, highly enjoy- 
able trunk full of delights. Titled 
simply Modem Science Fiction 
{Doubleday: pages and price un- 
available at this writing; see above 
remarks about galleys), it has been 
compiled and edited by none other 
than Norman Spinrad, a writer 
whose swift and continual growth 
amazes and pleases me. The ar- 
rangement of stories, with a small 
hint of what’s in each section is, 
first. The Golden Age, dealing with 
John Campbell’s extraordinary 
effect on the field, and such stories 
as JWC’s own Twilight and Asi- 
mov’s unique Nightfall, The 



96 



GALAXY 




Post-War Awakening, which in- 
cludes stories like Clarke’s The Star 
and one of the most effective (by 
which I mean the gigantic effect it 
has on writers and readers alike) 
stories ever written, Tom Godwin’s 
The Cold Equations: and finally 
The Full Flowering, with Thomas 
Disch’s asionishmg Descending, At 
the Mouse Circus by Ellison, and le 
Guin’s beautiful Nine Lives. Spin- 
rad has stoutly stitched the volume 
together with his own Foreword, 
Introduction, a long rubric preced- 
ing and illuminating each section, 
an Afterword and finally a Biblio- 
graphy to suggest further reading. 
Each story is followed by a short list 
of the author’s more significant 
work. In sum, it would be hard in- 
deed to find so perfect an introduc- 
tion to the field, or a richer feast for 
the cultivated taste. By the way: 
there’s one of my yarns in it. I have 
always felt a little peculiar about re- 
viewing books which include my 
work, and 1 have to say that my 
usual practice has been simply to 
pass when they come along, and say 
nothing, unless there is some over- 
riding reason to praise or condemn. 
Praise has it this time. It would be a 
great injustice to all of us to skip 
this one. And — sorry about the 
omission of pages and price. It’s a 
big book and I’m sure a small price 
for what you’re getting. Check it 
out. 

C OULD it be a Lunar flight 

Is one small step toward 



home? 

These words are Alfred Wor- 
den’s, from his book Hello, Earth 
(Los Angeles, Nash Publishing Co., 
80 pp, illus, $4.95), a small collec- 
tion of poems from the command 
pilot of Apollo 15. 15 was the first 
truly scientific moon landing, and 
its effect on all subsequent manned 
space flight is pivotal and pro- 
found. So it was for Col. Worden, 
an unassuming, soft-spoken man 
with a glint of humor and oc- 
casional flashes of deep passion for 
his work. So successful was NASA 
in presenting the astronaut as a 
super-macAo Mister Clean, whose 
occasional use of slang was re- 
garded with worshipful amaze- 
ment, that it comes as a mild shock 
to meet one who is thoughtful, 
articulate, and not a little touched 
by magic. Listen: 

A spacewalk 
Is like 

Being let out 
At night 
For a swim 
By Moby Dick. 

In many cases Worden’s images 
are better than his prosody, and 
quite often he chooses not to avoid 
a well-worn phrase. It is the 
integrity — 1 almost said ‘purity’ — 
of the man that shines through his 
words. He is not a great poet; he is 
a good man. The photographs, by 
the way, are magnificent. 

Next month I’ll describe a new 
spate of UFO books. Meanwhile, 
be well. ♦

H eed me, Yoshe, my star- 
dappled princess! Heed me 
well: there is something deeply 
mysterious about G — something 
beyond that grim devotion, beyond 
the confusion of self and service. Is 
it the eyes which gleam of times 
past or never to come? Or the 
stubborn insistence that he is well 
despite the pain? Or are these all 
merely symptoms of something 
greater — clues to an alien within? I 
do not know, Yoshe. Do. Not. 
Know. But the something is huge, 
palpable. And worrisome . 

Consider: on small-hours inspec- 
tion today, fresh from lodging, I 
sighted G in the depths of the nodal 
gallery, engrossed in Duties. The 
dimness chilled the very breath in 
my lungs, curtained me with appre- 
hension as I stood in my perch by 
the portal. Odors of soil and amino- 
plastic swirled about and clashed 
and grew upon each other to under- 
line the mood of combat in the air. 
Cautiously. I stepped forward onto 
the rim, and for a fearful moment 
observed unannounced, scarcely 
daring to breathe, curling down- 
ward along the way, around and 
around the darkened gallery, 
hugging the wall to elude the coni- 
fer’s needles. Below and below and 
below, made meek and insub- 
stantial in the presence of even that 
tiny foundling of a tree, G grew in 
size too slowly, looking centuries 
older, darker, more distant than 
when I’d last seen him. Flushed a 
gruesome orange by the lamps, he 



lay prone on his couch — rigid, 
Hand locked onto the Master’s 
circuit, mouth agape in a parody of 
self-absorption. Gleaming clots of 
perspiration rolled about on his 
brow, clogged the hairs of his chest 
and groin, scuttled all along the 
dips and declivities of his body — his 
ancient, withered body. And his 
Hand . his Hand, steaming with 
the fires of the drivers, lay silvery 
and supple on the circuitpad, a 
seven-digit bridge between G and 
his outer self. 

The silence was awesome, stif- 
ling, but its texture changed subtly 
as the Way whispered shut, and G 
blinked into awareness, his eye- 
lashes fluttering in anguished slow 
motion. He remained immobile, 
gasping for equilibrium, and it was 
I who ventured contact; 

“Reeling in. Master G?” 

Laboriously, he squinted through 
the haze of the lamps. “Right-o,” 
he said, wheezing the word, exhal- 
ing it, with the painful economy of 
the truly ancient. “Can’t be too 
careful, Po, can’t be too careful. 
Enna’s good to us, but she takes 
some care, y’know?’’ 

I didn’t respond: the statement 
was self-justifying, pathetic, and 
half-awareness — drawn back, no 
doubt, by the tug of some awkward 
inner knowledge. He shivered 
against the gel of the couch; his 
Hand trembled, mocking the 
rhythm of the drivers as though out 
of mere tenacity; his face grew taut 
once again, smooth and oblivious; 



99 




but the eyes, mirroring orange, slid 
slowly sideward in distrustful pur- 
suit as 1 lowered myself into the 
companion couch. 

He cleared his throat, busily and 
without apology. “Y’know, Po, 
they say a Master doesn’t need the 
skill anymore. But they’re wrong, 
y’know? There’s many an option 
’tween Destinations.” 

“Of course,” 1 said, carefully 
modulating my voice to avoid any 
hint of condescension. 

“Say!” he blurted. “How’re 
those lubbers of ours getting 
along?” ' 

Knowing that labored patience 
would offend him as readily as pity, 
1 ignored the remark. 

“Passenger Thirty-seven asked 
about you,” 1 said. 

“Nisa? Nice of her, real nice.” 
(Do you see? He denies the Pas- 
sengers! Confuses them with 
lubbers, Yoshe!) And, as though 
acknowledging this delusion, G 
shifted on the couch, swallowing a 
sigh. “Seen Yoshe or the others?” 
he added. 

“Not this month.” (1 lied since 1 
was fearful 1 might create the im- 
pression steps were being taken 
against him.) “They’re all in lodg- 
ing, 1 imagine.” 

“Course.” He appeared uncon- 
vinced. “Well, Hand’s twitching. 
Duties of the Caste! The Chosen 
and all, y’know?” 

It seemed futile to dispute him. 
“I’ve got to be drifting along any- 
way,” I said. “Any message for 



Thirty-seven?” 

But G’s eyes went to gloss as the 
curtain of Duty descended again, 
and T left just as I had come, 
Yoshe — stealthily, mystified, fear- 
ful. 



T his too I have seen, princess — 
and often, through these years 
without beginning or end: 

He lies unmoving, unmoved, as 
fhirty-seven glides into the gallery. 
Do you remember his Thirty-seven? 
Do you recall the rich tumbling 
curls, the beguiling curves, the 
smile of a thousand excitements? 
Each graceful movement, each 
warm shadow it makes across the 
gallery deck expresses the culmina- 
tion and intermeshing of a thou- 
sand lost arts and a thousand 
sciences. The loathsome embodi- 
ment of all perfection — yet a 
matchless vessel for his satisfac- 
tion, is it not? 

But it approaches, dancing, 
shedding its wisps of coverings, 
seductively calling out his name — 
and he refuses it. Tensing the 
bruised and knotted muscles of the 
arm which bears the Hand, squint- 
ing painfully through the lamp- 
fires, G looks but does not see. His 
Hand rests apprehensively on the 
pad, and as Thirty-seven comes 
nearer, gesturing evocatively in the 
language of the body, his eyes close 
or lurch sideward. Its every attempt 
to calm his fears, he spurns. Its 
every move to sate his deepest

GALAXY 




(hirsts, he ignores. And yet, reject- 
ing it, he defies it with a name. 
“Nisa,” he calls it. Calls it thus, 
and thus denies it. “Please leave me 
(o my Duties, Nisa. The Duties of 
(he Caste.” 

Can this be simple confusion, 
mistaking likeness for alikeness? 
Or is it, as I fear, a matter of 
lundamental denial and contradic- 
(ion? 

He, with all his aspirations, must 
accept his Thirty-seven, repulsive 
as it is, but accept it as what it is — 
his Passenger. It cannot be more, 
or less than what Time has made it. 
You, with your accepting ways, 
need not succumb to your 
Passenger; I, lacking a Hand, can 
rest content without mine. 

You see, Yoshe, I do not blame 
him. I fear him. 



H ave I mentioned the screens? 

The screens are blank, you 
know. Blank, and silent. All about 
him in the node, curving one into 
another in a glistening cylinder en- 
circling the base of the tree, they 
are blank. Alight with flares from 
(he lamps; panels of aminoplastic, 
afire. Nothing more. They trouble 
(he senses with silence, with 
smoothness, with lingering hints of 
(he remnants of smell which 
struggle through the nodor. They 
are a profanity to the eyes in their 
relentless, unchanging blankness. 
He looks, though — watches them, 
waits, hopes. His eyes roam on 



clockwork Duty, ravenously circling 
the node. What does he see? What 
can he possibly be awaiting? The 
screens are blank, you see, have 
been and will be. He lies on the 
couch beside the tree. Hand puls- 
ing, waiting. Watching the tree 
grow. Watching blank screens. Are 
they blank to him Yoshe? 

H eed me, princess! Consider 
the outrageous tale G perform- 
ed for me when I came upon him 
yesterday during phaseout inspec- 
tion: 

“Know how it all got started, Po? 
Our Hands? Our Destinations? 
The Long Life to suffer them? 
Well, things have beginnings and 
ends, y’know? And ours — our be- 
ginning — was Master A, the Savior 
of Paradis Colony.” (Watch, 
Yoshe! Gingerly, disengaging his 
Hand with painstaking care, G 
rises from the couch and assumes 
the pose of the storyteller, 
squatting in the shade of the tree.) 
“Back in Century One, it was — the 
Century when Choice began.” (You 
see, Yoshe? His hand and Hand 
weave through the shadows, 
evoking images of Youth and the 
long-ago.) “We were all lubbers, 
then. The Caste was soon to be, 
and Passengers, and Hands and 
Destinations, but we were lubbers 
and stiffs every one of us then — 
half-lived, rolled in the Company, 
prisoned in Galaxy Way. And the 
best of us was A, Master in old 
Bessa — the best and the swiftest

and brightest. 

“There he was, out by AltarA, 
halfway from Center to the end to 
his hop on the Edge of Galaxy 
Way.” (Watch the fingers flutter! 
Watch now, and listen!) “Stars 
stacked up all around him in pools 
and puddles and points . 
Bessa’s drivers moaning sweetly at 
the touch of his hands . stiffs 
bundled up in the sleeper, cool and 
crisp and patient . Master A 
was logging record time, on his way 
to another bonus on his last hop 
out — but then the call came 
through! A crackle from the 
’caster; ‘Distress! Danger! Paradis 
Colony in trouble!’ 

“Now, they’d settled Paradis in 
the Early Years, during the first 
wave or the second, and the fron- 
tier’d long passed them by. The 
place was a loner, circling a dwarf, 
and not another within fifty par- 
secs. And Paradis isolated, was 
Paradis alone — alone to build, 
alone to suffer and wonder. They’d 
contracted with the Company for 
tenth-year visits for news from 
Center and all the latest marvels 
and fads, but the Company’s prime 
directive was ‘Time is Our Tool,’ 
y’know? As the Early Years’d worn 
on into darkness, and they’d 
hopped themselves so thin across 
Galaxy Way that their lifelines 
weren’t worth the snapping, the 
Company’s visits to Paradis phased 
down from tenth -year to fiftieth 
and then to once a century. Who 
was it? — lubberman or woman 



who’d grow old and wither away! 
just to lug a few toys or trinkets to a' 
handful of colonists? Not Master 
A! When the lasercasts from Center 
could beam out the recipes faster? 
Not Master A! And the Company 
was so top-heavy with surplus they 
were spilling out the bonuses for 
the long hops to the Edge like mugs 
of juice at mug-up? And the fron- 
tier was all and everything . and 
no one was happy unless every step 
went that much further than the 
last . and death was what 
happened when you’d gone as far 
as you could? And it happened, all 
right, after two hops or three or not 
many more? 

“But Paradis was in trouble! 
Their sun was going nova — had 
been, would be, in fifty years or 
thirty! The lubbers would perish 
without a starship’s drivers to cool 
the fires, restore the balance! And 
Master A, the best and the swiftest 
and brightest, was the first in the 
Company to get the news. Thirty 
parsecs off, he was — a century or 
more — but the first! 

“There he was, out by AltarA, 
midway to the Edge of Galaxy 
Way: stars stacked up all around 
him in pools and puddles and 
points . Bessa’s drivers moaning 
sweetly at the touch of his 
hands . stiffs bundled up in the 
sleeper, cool and crisp and pa- 
tient ... a thousand lives and a 
bonus to weigh against ten 
million — and Time his only tool on 
his last hop out! Thirty years for

GALAX\ 




thirty parsecs! Unthinkable! Im- 
possible! The Barrier could never 
be breached! Bessa would melt, or- 
disappear! They’d lose themselves 
on the deserts of Time! Yet how 
could he fail to answer the call, to 
let ten million perish? How could 
he fail to try? 

“So, off came Bessa’s caps, and 
her ’brakes, and her memory of 
limits! Off came her ties, her 
doubts, her fears! 

“In a year and a day, Bessa was 
ready! Ready to roll, and roar, and 
swallow Time! 

“The day came, the hour, the 
minute ... A settled into the Mas- 
ter’s couch, hands caressing the cir- 
cuit . , thirty seconds to GO, then 
twenty, and ten ... his muscles 
tensed with visions of hope . 
live, four, three ... his thumb de- 
pressed the warmer . two, 
one . 

“For an instant, the blackness of 
darkness’ darkness: Time billowing 
up and sloshing about in waves and 
eddies and drops . Bessa’s 
drivers flaming hot with rivers of 
molten velocity . Space flowing 
into Time, and turning about, and 
twisting, and screaming with 
l)ain . 

“An instant, and then it was 
over. 

“Thirty years for thirty parsecs! 
Unthinkable! 

“But he did it. 

“The Barrier could never be 
breached! Impossible! 

“But he did it. 



“Bessa would melt, or disappear! 
They'd lose themselves on the 
deserts of Time! 

“Yes, but he went, and they 
didn’t. 

“And when it was done, and 
Paradis safe, and lubber limits for- 
gotten in darkness, they lifted him 
from the couch, his forearms 
charred to carbon. 

“They carried the Master out 
from Bessa, and down to the sur- 
face. and there he resolved to 
stay — to wait, smiling, for death to 
come slow and sweet. But as the 
days passed, and the months, and 
then a year, and the Motion Sick- 
ness came upon him in high-gee 
terror, and returned and returned, 
growing stronger and more awful, 
tearing his gut and peopling his 
visions with ravenous beasts. 
Master A grew old and older — 
swiftly, mercilessly, painfully. 

“Time had twisted his soul, you 
see. and gravity his body! A’s life 
was Motion, among the stars, and 
below was only the Sickness — the 
Sickness, and galloping death. And 
knowing this at last, he knew he 
couldn’t stay. 

“The Choice was made, the 
Caste had claimed its First. 

“Sadly, quickly, he fitted himself 
with Hands — proper Hands, to 
Handle his Bessa, and rock to her 
drivers’ rhythms. And soon he set 
out, the First of the Caste, the 
Savior of Paradis Colony, to the 
First Destination away from home 
in the puddle of Galaxy Way.’’ 



THE LAST DESTINATION OF MASTER G 



103 




H ave you pondered the tale I 
related yesterday? Have you let 
it’s absurdities and inconsistencies 
trickle down through that crude 
veneer of second-hand emotion? 
And do you see now, Yoshe, how 
the mystery deepens and darkens? 
How our Master G overflows with 
fanciful tales of Origins, with 
dubious notions and fear of the 
truth? Can there be any doubt of 
the danger in this? 

1 should — no, must explain that 
no sooner was the tale performed 
than a dreadful screaming silence 
took hold again on the node. For 
the longest moment of Time — an 
hour? a year? from phaseout to 
phasein? — G remained on the 
deck, legs intertwined in the story- 
teller’s squat, hand and Hand 
crossed on his sweat-drenched 
chest; he swayed ungently from side 
to side, as though rocked from 
doubt to hope by a greater Hand. 
Fearful of setting off some new and 
more worrisome tirade, 1 lay mo- 
tionless on the companion couch, 
waiting . 

Cool and unhurried, the tree 
reached upward, sending its 
needles upward, upward, brushing 
the portal to Lodging Module, 
upward tow ard the limits of its con- 
fmement . 

Once the lamps warmed the end 
of phaseout — or later? much 
later? — G rose without prelude and 
strode from the shadows to resume 
his pose on the couch. But in the in- 
stant before his Hand locked on, he 



turned, examining the panels of 
blankness all about him in one lop- 
ing circle, and then peered at me, 
his eyes framed with blood-red 
shadow's: 

"Think w'e’ll ever get there, Po? 
Think we’ll ever get there?’’ 

His tone — frightened and wist- 
ful, wistful with not knowing — 
magnified my worries a thousand- 
fold, transmuting fear to bone- 
wrenching terror. 1 bolted from the 
couch, but before 1 could leap onto 
the way and find refuge elsewhere, 
he jerked his Hand back from the 
pad with the extraordinary strength 
he can still muster in times of un- 
usual stress and, sitting stiffly up- 
right, shouted at me — yes, Yoshe, 
he shouted: 

"They’re out there, Po! Some- 
where! They’re out there!’’ 

There was more, of course — 
more, and more, and more, uttered 
with the shrill ferocity of one who 
cannot be denied, but it was no 
more than a rumble, an indistin- 
guishable roar beyond the portal. 
There, in my safety, G’s delusions 
could not reach me . 

T here are patterns here, Yoshe, 
patterns which cannot be ig- 
nored. 

Patterns of rhythm: the Hand 
twitches, G twitches, the eyes shift, 
the Hand twitches; G moves from 
mug-up to meal-down, from lodg- 
ing to node, from Destination to 
Destination. Each instant is but a 
memory. meaningful only as 



104 



GALAXY 




memory-that-was or memory-that- 
will-be. But there is no stopping G. 
It is all he knows. The Hand 
twitches, G twitches, the eyes shift, 
the Hand twitches. He asks me, 
“Will we ever get there, Po? Will 
we ever get there?” Yet he goes on. 
There is no stopping. 

And patterns of design: G fears 
the Loneliness and the Darkness, 
yet he seeks them always, fearing 
their distaff twins; he is Changed 
and not-Changed, yet he denies 
change; he is hand and Hand, 
lubber and not. Lost but not lost, 
alive yet beyond Life; he is con- 
tinually in Motion, yet never 
moves; he sees me, fears me, yet 
cannot admit me. 

Patterns of flux: Time lumbers 
on, taking huge gulps. 

Is he (were we?) the Chosen, or 
the Damned? He is (we are) not- 
lubbers, not-Passengers, yet are 
we? We stand erect, seeking skies 
above and ground below, yet we 
can attain neither. Is this G’s plan? 
Is it the Company’s? Is it yours? 

Why don’t you speak, Yoshe? 
Respond! 

He fears me, I tell you. Fears 
examination, exposure. 

Yes — these are patterns which 
cannot be ignored. 

Y ou needn’t worry about me. 
I’m a lot better today! Do you 
see. my princess, my light of inner 
lights? Do you see how I glow and 
cavort and pirouette? Yes, I’m feel- 
ing much better because now I

know how things stand. Stand? I’m 
funning you, princess. Where can 
we stand? We’re of the Caste, 
aren’t we? You do see the humor? 
Of course you do. I don’t need your 
laughter or smiles to know you see 
the humor. But this is a serious 
matter — a most serious matter, this 
madness of G’s. There’s no time for 
laughter or smiles. No — no time. 
You see, now I grasp G’s madness, 
understand it, see my place in it, 
and yours, and the others’. I hold it 
in my hands and form it into 
myriad shapes which capture the 
gleam of transient starlight and in 
that gleam stand out stark and bald 
and undeniable! Thus it is illumi- 
nated, this madness. I embrace it 
fully, swallow it, gag on it. Yes. 
Now I’ve eaten the madness, the 
poison, the essence of G’s con- 
fusion. I have suspected this for 
some time, spoken of it, pondered 
it — but now I know it. 

You see, Yoshe, he confuses Pas- 
senger with lubber. Yes! It’s truly 
as simple as that — as simple and as 
subtly horrid. 

G speaks of “Nisa,” of “her,” of 
“his Nisa.” Do you hear that, 
fathom it? Can there be such mad- 
ness? A Name for a Passenger — a 
numbered one! This is poison. 
Poison! To a quivering hunk of 
neuroplastic and tine-meshed wire 
and self-regenerative plasm he 
gives a Name! The Name of a 
lubber! Do you see how he thus de- 
ludes himself, how he claims to be a 
part of things which are no more? 



And do you see — yes! — how he 
denies us? Denies you, Yoshe, and 
me, and the others? 

His logic, Yoshe, his muddled 
cringing thoughts, are most subtle. 
To G, you see, we are all lubbers, 
and thus there will always be 
lubbers. He and you and I; Alor, 
Lulak, Lu — but not the six of us 
alone, for to him there is also “his 
Nisa,” and there are the other Pas- 
sengers, yours and all the others’, 
and to him we are lubbers one and 
all. All of us are a part of things — 
things which are no more — and 
thus things go on, and on, and on, 
and do not, will not, cannot drop 
unnoticed through the floor of 
Time. Yes! G lives with this de- 
lusion, this poison, attempts to 
spread it about. As though he 
didn’t make the Choice! As though 
the day of the lubber might still be 
with us! 

“They’re out there, Po,” he says. 
“Somewhere! They’re out there!” 

Are they, Yoshe? Are they? 

N ow WE are five. The Caste is 
five. 

Alor couldn’t wait, you see. 
Somehow, in some way we shall 
never know (or want to), she 
slipped into the sleeper, deacti- 
vated its failsafes, and there, be- 
yond the reach of her Passenger — 
her Keeper — ripped off her Hand. 
The Passenger couldn’t stop her, 
couldn’t make her wait, and she — 
grew old. Passed from life. Abrupt- 
ly. 1 found her lifeless body going to 



106 



GALAXY 




dust in the sleeper. Or perhaps I 
arrived earlier. Perhaps it was not 
entirely her choice to Change in 
quite that way. I don’t know. It was 
so long ago. 

Have such things happened 
before on Enna? I have the feeling 
they have. A nagging feeling . 

Now, if 1 had a Hand, I’d rip it 
off too. But I don’t, do I? Do I, 
Yoshe? Tell me I don’t. I know it, 
but 1 want to hear you say it. 

Of course, G won’t hear any of 
this about Alor. Today, only other 
Duties pre-empted contact with 
him, but 1 won’t see him tomorrow 
or the next day either, or perhaps 
for a year of years, and by the time 
1 do, maybe I’ll have forgotten. 
Maybe. 1 hope so. It is clear why I 
don’t want to see him, isn’t it? 
Clear that the less frequent and 
regular my visits, the less obvious 
will be my investigation of him? 

You do see, don’t you? My Duty 
is to oversee him, hold him back 
from rash beliefs and foolish acts. 
This is only my Duty, and now it is 
my only Duty. Aside from these re- 
ports, of course. You do see, don’t 
you? We are five now. Alor has 
Changed again. The Caste is five. 

Or perhaps there are others. Per- 
haps . 

Today’s a day for riddles, my 
love — riddles! 

Think now, 1 know you’ll come 
up with the answers! 

Why does the tree grow feet every 
day, and why don’t we have hands? 



Got them? Here’s another; 

If a day is a thousand years or ten 
million, how long is a day? 

Puzzled? Riddled? Perplexed? 
Try this one — it’s really a puzzler; 

If we want Time to go slower, 
why must we go faster? Or put it 
this way; why do we go farther and 
farther to get nearer and nearer? 

You see? Why does the tree grow 
feet. How long is a day. Why do we 
go faster. Think now — I know 
you’re going to laugh when I tell 
you the answers . 

Give up? I’m surprised, Yoshe. 
You were always so quick, no pun 
intended. But okay. 

The tree grows feet every day be- 
cause it doesn’t have a Hand! And 
we don’t have hands because 
there’s nothing we can touch! You 
see? 

And a day isn’t a thousand years 
or ten million! A day is a day is a 
day. That’s all it can be. 

But here’s the really tricky one; if 
we want to get nearer and nearer, 
and we want Time to go slower, we 
go farther and farther and faster 
and faster because Time gets used 
up! It does, Yoshe. Yes, it does. I 
know it does. No matter what he 
says. 

Funny, isn’t it? 

Y oshe! Do you hear me? We 
found it! We reached our 
Destination today! Yes! Do you 
hear me, princess? Today we were 
back in Galaxy Way! 

It was during smallhours. I was 



THE LAST DESTINATION OF MASTER G

in lodging with Kulak, observing 
while he executed an especially in- 
tricate maneuver in his game and 
attempting, in vain as always, to 
communicate my admiration to 
him, when one of the Passengers’ 
approach-warnings virtually ex- 
ploded with the news! I stumbled to 
the nearest portal and, somehow, 
this way or that through Enna’s 
bowels, struggled into the Nodal 
Module, and then into the gallery, 
where I found Master G already 
locked on amid the blazing screens. 
Blazing! They were burning, roast- 
ing, flaming with lights from the 
stars! 

Choking back my delirium, I 
joined Master G, taking my place 
on the companion couch and, with 
him, attuned my Hand to the 
scanners. Their song was a song of 
arrival! it rocked and roared and 
coursed throughout me with 
rhythms 1 thought I'd forgotten; it 
played sweetly, calling up all the 
colors and the textures and tastes of 
what we have all missed for so very 
long! 

The probability, Yoshe — the 
probability was ninety sixth percen- 
tile! Yes! Veritably certain that 
we’ve found Galaxy Way! 

When Master G and I reached 
this conclusion — almost simul- 
taneously, it seemed — he shrugged 
himself higher and peered across at 
me. His eyes were alight with 
exultation. “How about that, Po? 
How about that?” he said. 

Independently, each of us groped 



his way into calibration with the 
near-scanners to examine our im- 
mediate surroundings. As I 
immersed myself further and 
further w ithin the sloshing currents 
of sensation Enna was transmitting 
through my Hand, the gallery re- 
ceded into haze, and memory into 
darkness. There was but one 
reality — starlight, chill and pierc- 
ing — and one life. Finite. Bearable. 
It can do that to you, you know? 
Remember? 

Our stopping-place was a 
moderate-sized star system not far 
from the Edge of the Way — a 
binary, white and Yellow II, with a 
half-dozen worlds whirling about 
eccentrically — and of course we 
found no signs of lubber life there. 
But there are billions of others in 
the Way, and tomorrow or tomor- 
row in a million years or ten we’ll be 
back again from the Clouds and 
maybe there’ll be lubbers there and 
then. And if not there and then — 
well, w'e can return again and 
again! They’ve got to return some 
time! 

Anyway, that’s what Master G 
told me. He said if they’re all dead, 
or they’ve all gone away, all we 
need do is keep coming back later 
and later, and somewhere — some- 
time — we’ll find them. He said it 
softly, patiently, eyes fixed on the 
hazy reaches of the tree above, and 
once he had said his say, I rose 
silently from the couch and moved 
to board the way. 

Then it w as that 1 noticed Thirty- 



108 



GALAXY 




seven, seated on the deck unspeak- 
ing and unmoving, its smooth back 
arched against the trunk of the 
tree. The gnarled and mottled 
trunk of the tree, which then 
seemed older and bigger than ever 
and overripe for replacement. 
While Thirty-seven, by contrast, 
was as secure and patient as in any 
time through Time in its war of 
attrition against Master G. 

But he? He was settling down for 
the long hop back out to the 
Clouds. 

You know, Yoshe, I’ve just 
thought of something funny. The 
Way’s a galaxy like all the rest of 
them. Stars, Yoshe. Stars and dust. 
And isn’t it funny too how we die a 
little each time, each time we reach 
our Destination? Now, if we come 
back often enough, then eventually 
we’ll die, won’t we? We will die, 
won’t we? Why should the tree 
grow old and die, and not we? Why 
is there so much w'e cannot under- 
stand? 

Master G says they’re out there. 
He says they are. 

Y oshe . .! 

Yoshe . .! 

You’re hiding from me, princess! 
Do you think 1 don’t know? Do you 
think 1 don’t know you’re hiding, 
and why? That 1 don’t know your 
fear of me? Your fear of my power? 
Do you think I don’t know that 
when I’m not with you, you speak 
with the others? With Alor and 



Kulak and Lu, and — yes! — with G, 
with the hateful Master G, dis- 
cussing me, taking steps? Do you 
think I don’t know this? 

You are hiding from me, aren’t 
you? Hiding and fearing me? 

Why don’t you speak, Yoshe? 

1 know you’re not dead, princess. 
1 see you breathe. Yes, I see it . 
there! You inhale . exhale . 
the breasts rise golden and 
luscious . slowly . the nipples 
broad and sleeping . slowly . 
rise . and fall . rise and 
fall . 

1 know you’re not dead, princess. 
We don’t die. The trees die, and 
the stars, and lubbers. All the 
lubbers, every one of them. But we 
don’t die. The longer we look, the

there’s a definite theoretical limit to 
what we can do with chemical 
rockets, and manned interplanetary 
cruises — other than spectacular 
one-shots to say we’ve done it — are 
beyond those limits. 

Let’s see why and then look at 
ships that can take man to the 
planets. 

F irst we’ll need a couple of 
basic facts about propulsion. 
Jim Baen and 1 are agreed that this 
column won't become a substitute 
for a textbook, and I’ll keep the lec- 
ture short. 

Rockets are still the only means 
of interplanetary travel we have, 
and they work by throwing mass 
overboard. The more mass tossed, 
and the faster it goes aft, the more 
thrust: 

Thrust (force) = (rate of mass 
loss) X (exhaust velocity) or, 
T = (Mq^Mi) X (Vp) 
T 

(Equation one.) 

What this says is you take the 
weight of the ship when you get 
through burning fuel, subtract that 
from the weight you started with, 
divide by time of burn and multiply 
by the velocity the burned fuel went 
aftwards from the ship; and you get 
thrust. Now in the foot/pound 
measurement system, thrust is ex- 
pressed in pounds and sounds like 
a weight. It’s not, it’s a force, but it 
does have one convenient property. 
One pound of thrust will just 



support one pound of weight in the 
gravity of the Earth’s surface. It 
will accelerate that same mass at 
one gravity if you started in orbit. 
In metric systems, thrust is ex- 
pressed in newtons or dynes, and if 
you don’t understand the difference 
between mass and weight, they 
aren’t easy to interpret. 

However, equation one makes it 
easy to see that if you don’t want to 
throw much mass overboard, you’d 
better get it going aft at a fast 
clip — that is, you need high Vg. 

Now Vg happens to be related to 
the temperature of the burn in the 
rocket engine, so naturally there’s a 
limit to how high Vg can get; if it’s 
hot enough, the engine melts, and 
your rocket won’t work so good. It 
should be clear, though, that the 
theoretical Vg obtainable with any 
given combination of fuel and 
oxidizer is a good measure of how 
efficient that combination would be 
as a rocket fuel. 

However, for reasons I won’t go 
into, instead of Vg most engineers 
use another measure of fuel effi- 
ciency known as Specific Impulse, 
abbreviated l^p; this is given in 
units called “seconds.” That’s not 
really a unit of time. I^p is the 
“pounds of thrust obtained per 
pound of fuel expended per 
second”, obviously a measure of 
efficiency; and 

I = V 

sp (Equation two) 

O 

where g is the acceleration of 



111 




gravity: 980 cm/sec/sec in the met- 
tric system and 32 ft. /sec/sec in the 
English. 

Now we have a measure of fuel 
efficiency, but we don’t know what 
we need for interplanetary travel. 
As I’ve shown before in these 
columns, one of the most con- 
venient figures to look at is “delta- 
vee”, meaning the total change in 
velocity we can get from a ship if we 
burn all the fuel in it. Delta-v is 
convenient because it doesn’t 
matter if you burn all the fuel at 
once, or keep turning the motor on 
and off; and furthermore, we can 
calculate the delta-v needed for 
various space missions without 
knowing anything about the ships 
at all. Big or little, it takes the same 
delta-v to get into orbit, or to go 
from here to Mars. 

We’re almost done with the 
rocketry basics, but we need one 
more equation: 

Delta-v = Vg logg M j 
(Equation Three) 

What this says is that the total 
velocity change you can get from a 
rocketship can be found by know- 
ing the exhaust velocity of the fuel 
burned, and the ratio of the mass 
when you started to the mass when 
you finished the mission. Log-base- 
e is the “Natural log’’ of that ratio, 
and if you don’t understand logs, 
don’t worry about it. It’s tabled in 
handbooks or given by scientific 
pocket computers.* 

Early chemical rockets used 



fuel/oxydizer combinations with 
Ijp of under 200 pounds. That 
means that at a mass-flow rate of 1 
pound a second, the rocket could 
lift about 200 pounds against 
gravity. Recall, though, that this is 
the total weight lifted, including 
the fuel to be burned in the next 
seconds, etc., and you’ll see it’s not 
so good after all. 

Incidentally, if you’ll look at the 
three equations you’ll see why 
liquid-fuel rockets start lifting 
slowly and get faster and faster as 
they rise. The mass-flow stays the 
same, but they’re burning fuel and 
getting lighter all the time. Since 
the thrust hasn’t changed, but the 
mass it has to lift is decreasing, the 
acceleration the motor imparts to 
the rocket inereases steadily. 

Roeket chemists worked very 
hard to get higher l^p (and thus 
higher exhaust velocities), and now 
the best solid fuel rockets have I^p 
in the order of 250 seconds. Mean- 
while, liquid-fuel rocket motors 
were developed to give even higher 
speeific impulses, and by using 
liquid oxygen (LOX) and routing 
that around the motor to cool it be- 
fore it was burned, higher burning 
temperatures were achieved. 



* An easier way to calculate delta-v is 
to send $3 to Rand Corporation, 1700 
Main St., Santa Monica, Calif. 90406 
and ask for a “Rocket Performance 
Computer.” It’s a circular slide rule 
developed by Ed Sharkey, and it 
comes with a book of instructions. 
You enter with Isp and mass ratio and 
it gives delta-v directly. 



112 



GALAXY 




Hventually, LOX made I^p of 300 
nearly routine. More exotic fuels 
were employed, including liquid 
hydrogen with LQX, and finally 
hydrogen and flourine. 

However, with the best chemical 
fuels, the theoretical maximum I^p 
is no more than 400. Actually, no 
one has got that yet; and it’s certain 
(hat no chemical rocket will do 
better. 

Isp of 400 is an exhaust velocity, 
at best, of 3.9 kilometers/second. 
Let’s plug that into equation three 
for various mass ratios and see 
what happens. (Table One.)

It takes about 8 km/second to 
get into Earth orbit, which means 
the best chemical rockets have to be 
almost 90% fuel simply to get into 
orbit in a single stage; but let’s as- 
sume we start in Earth orbit. 

3'o get to Mars requires about 
5.5 km/sec velocity if you start in 
l:arth orbit — and it takes that 
much again to get back. Clearly, if 
we’re to carry any payloads to 
Mars, we need refueling out there. 

Equally clearly, we’ve got a prob- 
lem, because how do we ferry 
enough equipment to set up a fuel- 
ing station on Mars? About 80% of 



our payload put into Earth orbit 
gets burned before we reach Mars. 

To make a round trip, which 
means carrying the fuel to come 
home with, we have to put 20 
pounds into Earth orbit for each 
pound making the trip from Earth 
to Mars and back again. Even one 
way takes a factor of four to one, 
not impossible, but expensive 
enough. Still, we could imagine 
commerce in which four tons of fuel 
were burned for each ton of pay- 
load delivered. 

Unfortunately, minimum energy 
transfers (and those are the only 
kind possible with chemical 
rockets; anything else required 
delta-v in the tens to hundreds of 
km/sec) take time: 260 days to 
Mars. 

People eat, drink, and breathe. 
With the best recycling we’re going 
to have consumables aboard the 
ships — and the recycling systems 
are massive, too. Let’s be generous 
and say we hold things to 5 pounds 
a day per passenger, and start with 
people who weigh 200 pounds each. 
That's 1500 pounds of passenger 
and consumables — and 6000 
pounds of fuel for his one-way trip. 

If we can’t refuel at Mars and 
have to carry our return LOX and 
hydrogen out with us, it’s far worse. 
You need 150,000 pounds of fuel in 
Earth orbit for each round trip 
passenger. Clearly, that’s not a 
commercial proposition. Chemical 
rockets can give us commerce with 
Mars only if we can build a Mars

113 




orbiter and fueling station, and 
even then it’s marginal: and 

remember, we’ve given chemical 
rockets the best possible perfor- 
mance. It’s not good enough. 

W HAT are the alternatives, 
then? We have several, one of 
which could have been developed 
by the end of this decade. 

How would you like to have had a 
10 person scientific mission leave 
Earth orbit in June, 1979, to arrive 
at Mars 227 days later; orbit Mars 
for 48 days, then head for Venus, 
encounter the asteroid Eros and 
stay near it for a day or so; then go 
on to orbit Venus for 55 days and, 
finally, 710 days after it departed, 
return to Earth orbit? 

It could have been built. I have a 
model of the spacecraft that could 
have carried that mission. It em- 
ploys a stabilized main section, and 
a counterbalanced rotating crew- 
quarters section to give about 10% 
gravity; it carries plenty of scientific 
instruments, and a small nuclear 
electric power plant; and by 
making rendezvous in Mars orbit 
with an expendable fuel pod, pil- 
grim could have sent down a 
manned Mars lander. 

The model was built by model 
PRODUCTS of Mount Clemens, 
Michigan, and sold for about 5 
dollars under the name pilgrim 
OBSERVER. The engineering and 
celestial mechanics of the model 
and its mission were very well 
worked out — and we really could 



have built it for a 1979 flight. The 
engine employed was an atomic 
rocket called nerva. 

Unfortunately, neither the model 
nor the engine are available any 
longer, and for the same reason: no 
public interest. MFC took pilgrim 
out of production at about the same 
time as Congress cancelled the 
budget of Project nerva. This was 
just after Apollo 15, when people 
lost interest in space, and I was in- 
volved in trying to save nerva: 
involved to the extent of writing 
some columns in daily papers, and 
furnishing the House Science Com- 
mittee with data. But despite my ef- 
forts, which weren’t important, and 
those of Congressman Barry Gold- 
water, Jr., which were very im- 
portant, NERVA died. 

Ironically it died a great success. 
It had been ground tested and 
found to work fine. 

NERVA works like the “atomic 
rockets’’ of the better science fic- 
tion writers of the 40’s and 50’s. 
Basically, it’s a nuclear reactor with 
a rocket nozzle at the end: you 
squirt fuel, say hydrogen, through 
the reactor; it gets hot; and out it 
comes, fast, to propel the ship. 

Now NERVA didn’t burn any 
hotter than the best chemical 
rockets; in fact, some chemical 
rockets operate at nearly 3000°, 
which is better than nerva’s design 
specs called for. However, Ve, 
which is \^’hat you want to maxi- 
mize, depends not only on the 
temperature of the reaction, but 



114 



GALAXY 




also on the molecular weight of 
what you’re throwing overboard. 

Hydrogen burning in oxygen^ 
produces water, with molecular 
weight of 18. Even hydrogen and 
tlourine give off HF with a weight 
of 10. (It’s also rather corrosive, 
since the least moisture converts it 
to hydroflouric acid.) But nerva 
squirted out molecular hydrogen, 
and that has a weight of only two. 

The best tested I^p for nerva 
was 650. The designers of pilgrim 
assumed they’d get 850 by 1978, 
and that was reasonable. Most en- 
gineers now think NERVA-type craft 
can get Ij^p of 1200. Let’s plug those 
into Equation three and see what 
we Come up with.

Even with the lower figure, you 
can get a round-trip to Mars at a 
mass-ratio of four. With that kind 
of capability, commerce between 
the planets becomes economically 
feasible. It’s still expensive, but 
given some kind of system to get 
materials into orbit at either end, 
it’s more than just possible — it be- 
comes likely. 

T here’s another alternative to 
NERVA, though, and it too was 
studied extensively before it was 



abandoned. It was called orion, 
and on first description it seems 
like the most unlikely method of 
space travel you ever could devise. 

ORION was also known affection- 
ately as Bang-Bang. It worked very 
simply: you take a big ship, and on 
the bottom you put a very thick 
metal plate. You hang the rest of 
the ship in such a way that there are 
a lot of shock absorbers between 
the base plate and the ship itself. 

Then you set off an atomic bomb 
underneath the ship. 

Believe me, the ship will move. 
When it starts to slow down, you 
fling another atom bomb down be- 
low and detonate it. You keep 
doing that until you’ve got enough 
velocity to get where you want to 

go- 

Silly as it sounds, orion would 
have worked. There were some 
problems. Obviously that base 
plate and suspension system had to 
be carefully designed. You prob- 
ably wanted a small shielded com- 
partment for the crew and those 
items you carried that couldn’t take 
hard x-rays, and a larger compart- 
ment, unshielded, for the rest of 
the cargo. None of this would have 
been difficult. 

Another problem with orion 
was coupling the energy from the 
bomb to the ship. Atom bombs put 
out a lot of x-rays and neutrons and 
heat, and of course once out of the 
atmosphere there’s no blast at all. 
But even that problem was solved: 
you have to put something between 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



115 




the bomb and the ship, something 
that will absorb energy from the 
bomb and whap! the bottom of the 
ship to keep it moving: something 
like styrofoam, for example, which 
looks as if it would work despite its 
unlikeliness. 

ORION works better from orbit, 
but it could lift from Earth — if it 
weren’t for the Treaty of Moscow 
that prohibits surface detonations 
of nuclear weapons, and if you 
weren’t worried about the fallout. 

It has been calculated that 
ORION would put 5 million pounds 
in orbit, or land two million plus 
pounds on the Moon — and do it on 
one whack. That’s enough for a 
fair-sized colony’s consumables 
and machine tools. 

Of course we won’t use orion to 
launch from the Earth’s surface, 
but there’s nothing wrong with us- 
ing it from Earth orbit to plant 
Lunar and Martian colonies; it’s 
the most efficient and cheapest 
form of space transportation 
known, believe it or not. 



M oreover, orion works us to- 
ward something even cheap- 
er. The problem with orion at the 
moment is that you’re blowing off a 
kilo or so of weapons-grade U-235 
with each bang, and that stuffs not 
cheap. Aviation Week and a few 
other publications have been hint- 
ing that fusion bombs with laser 
trigger either have been or are 
about to be developed: with these. 



you don’t need a U-235 primary, 
you just have a hot laser zap some 
Tritium or Deuterium. It’s more 
bang for the buck, and it would 
power ORION nicely. 

Dr. Greg Benford has also de- 
scribed a system that would be even 
cheaper: you have a big power 
source on the ship, say a small 
fission reactor. That feeds a big 
laser. Pellets of Tritium or 
Deuterium are ejected below the 
ship, and zapped from the laser, 
producing fusion to drive the ship, 
it’s the ORION principle again, 
carried to its most efficient ex- 
treme. 

When you’ve got ships like that, 
you don’t even talk about I^p and 
exhaust velocities, and the mass 
ratios are actually fractional — that 
is, the ship that arrives weighs more 
than the fuel expended to get there. 

All these ships were once serious- 
ly studied. Now, it’s only in univer- 
sities and among science-fiction 
people that they’re mentioned, and 
even there most don’t take orion- 
type ships very seriously. Yet any of 
these ships could have given us the 
planets — and until either the 
NERVA or the orion principles are 
exploited, the black-box boys have 
won. 

Man can dominate near-Earth 
space using the shuttle and laser 
launchers; but until we go beyond 
chemical rockets, interplanetary 
space will belong to unmanned 
probes. ^

This is a classic ‘problem’ sf story—

the problem! 



JOHN CHRISTOPHER 



T hey were five days out from the 
Base when the caterpillar strip- 
ped a track. Dugmore was driving. 
They had entered a wide ravine 
spectacularly divided between sun- 
light and shadow, cold black and 
blinding white. Although the line of 
demarcation ran roughly along the 
center, Dugmore kept within the 
sunlit area to avoid putting extra 
strain on the relays. 

Ahead he noticed a dip in the 
ravine floor — a medium-sized cra- 
ter that took up the entire width of 
the ravine. He studied the obstacle 
as they approached. Both the dip 
and the ascent on the far side were 
well inside the caterpillar’s po- 
tential — and since there was no way 
around and going back would in- 
volve a long detour; he drove on. 

The caterpillar reached the lip of 
the crater, nosed down. Suddenly 
there was a screech of tracks trying 
to grip and failing, a sensation of 
sliding. Corfield was thrown against 
him. They wound up in a heap on 
the floor, knocked about but un- 
damaged. 

They donned suits and went out 



to examine the damage. It was 
easily found. The left-hand track 
was broken and stripped, a limp 
tail that trailed behind the caterpil- 
lar. They touched helmets to speak, 
a grotesquely romantic gesture, 
Dugmore always thought. 

Corfield said: “Think you can 
manage it?” 

His voice was small and tinny; 
even normally it was high-pitched 
for a man so massive. Dugmore 
said: 

“Nothing to it. Go and amuse 
yourself.” 

Of course, Corfield could have 
done the work just as Dugmore 
could carry out the necessary min- 
eralogical surveys; but this was 
basically Dugmore’s field, just as 
the other was Corfield’s. It was 
simple enough — a straight-forward 
job of welding and reassembly. Be- 
fore getting the tools, he straight- 
ened his back and had a look at the 
surrounding scene. The caterpillar 
had slid to the bottom of the crater, 
which was filled with loose rock and 
gravel, and dotted with boulders. 
All very dead, bleakly devoid of life. 



118 




Inside, he had a shot at raising 
Cape Kennedy before picking up 
the welder. No good. Direct com- 
munication with Base had, of 
course, been out since they dropped 
below the horizon. After that, sig- 
nals had to be bounced through the 
link stations back on Earth. The 
sun-spot interference had come in 
first on the morning of the third 
day, and on the next contact, when 
they should have had Tokyo, there 
was nothing but howls, whistles 
and bangs. The regulations ruled 
that you turned back on losing 
touch, but this particular edict was 
honored mainly in the breach — had 
been broken, in fact, by the last 
probe as well. The point was that 
the caterpillar was pretty much an 
independent entity: air and water, 
with re-cycling, would last a couple 
of months, food concentrate, half 
as long again. 

There were other considerations 
as well. One was that they had been 
waiting a long time for the chance 
to get out of the underground 
tunnel that was Base. Another was 
that theirs was the fourth probe, 
heading south as the previous ones 
had gone west, north and east and 
there was a certain amount of 
rivalry as to distance covered. 
Probe 2 had done best so far, but 
they were ahead of them so far. 
fhey had little difficulty in making 
up their minds to carry on. The 
I’ollowing day they got through to 
Shannon, though only in Morse: 
K/T was still impossible. 



“Day” was a misleading word. 
The probes set out from Base at the 
lunar daybreak, travelled away 
with the rising sun and then, as it 
began to slip from the zenith, made 
their way back. Seven earth days 
each way. But they continued to 
live on a twenty-four hour clock, 
taking it in turns to have the six 
hours sleep which was as much as 
anyone needed on the moon. 

If anything went wrong they 
could easily survive the fourteen- 
day lunar night. They would stay 
warm and snug in their caterpillar, 
and could listen again to the music 
tapes or re-read the flimsy rice- 
paper books. It would be a bit bor- 
ing but that was something they 
were used to. There were no 
hazards: no storms, no monsters. A 
dead world, in which nothing 
changed, nor had changed for hun- 
dreds of thousands of years. The 
most interesting thing any previous 
probe had turned up had been a 
high-temperature streak in the tufa 
which covered the greater part of 
the ground area, the high tempera- 
ture being ten degrees above calcu- 
lation. 

They, of course, had discovered 
Corfield’s invisible worms. Dug- 
more smiled at the thought. 

They stopped at specified inter- 
vals to take specimens. Usually 
Corfield brought back two or three 
cores, but the last time he had 
taken the cutter and sliced out a 
much larger section, a piece of rock 
about two feet square and a couple

119 




of inches thick. On Earth, it would 
have been quite a weight, but he 
hefted it easily. Too easily even for 
the Moon. When he carried it 
through the lock, Dugmore said: 
“A hefty chunk of real estate, 
that. You planning to take it back 
to Joan for that rock garden of 
hers?” 

“What would you say it was?” 
Dugmore looked at it. A section 
of typical ore-bearing basalt, ex- 
cept that instead of ore veins it had 
. well, holes. In parts it looked 
as though worms had crawled 
through the rock, an unlikely no- 
tion to say the least. 

“Metalliferous,” he said, “with- 
out the metal.” 

Corfield nodded. He looked ex- 
cited. 

“Typical iron-bearing rock. I’d 
swear to that. But without iron. Al- 
most as though it had been leached 
out.” 

“Doesn’t iron oxidize?” 

“Where there’s oxygen, it can.” 
“Then maybe the moon had an 
atmosphere at one time.” 

Dugmore considered the point. 
“A rather selective one. We’ve 
come across plenty of exposed iron 
ore elsewhere.” 

“Then there’s life on the moon 
after all. The rock-eating lunar 
worm. Vermis Lunaris Corfieldis. 
O.K. to move on, or do you want 
more from here?” 

Corfield was studying the rock. 
He said abstractedly: 

“Sure, move on.” 



F or an hour, Dugmore bent over 
the welder, with Corfield check- 
ing occasionally to see how things 
were going. He thought it was time 
then to have a break for food. He 
went in and opened a self-heating 
can of high-protein, low-residue 
mush, chicken and ham flavour. 
He was not sure whether the texture 
or the flavour inspired more 
nausea. But it was nourishing. 
They had been well assured of that. 

Corfield followed him in. “How 
long now?” he asked. 

“Another hour, I should think.” 
“Fair enough. You picked an 
interesting spot to bust a track.” 
“More worms?” 

“By the dozen, from the looks of 
it. A good place for siting an iron 
mine, except that it’s been sur- 
face-mined already. And with high 
efficiency. I’ve found a couple of 
pockets where the iron content as- 
says staggeringly high. The rest is 
holes where the iron ought to be.” 
Dugmore plugged in a tape of 
the musical, “Royal Scot.” 

“You can have yourself a ball 
with it. A short one, anyway. We 
need to get on, since it’s turn- 
around tomorrow.” 

Corfield, whose taste was for 
string quartets, grimaced as the 
Overture belted out. 

“1 think I’ll get out there right 
away.” 

The job in fact took another two 
and a half hours to finish. In that 
time, the line dividing sunlight 
from shadow had shifted fraction- 



120 



GALAXY 




ally away from them. At the top of 
the rise there was a boulder — about 
three feet in diameter — one edge 
gleamed now in the sun’s marginal- 
ly more yerticai ray. They went in- 
side, Corfield taking the tiller. It 
was his turn for driving, and Dug- 
more was tired, anyway. His sleep 
period was almost due, and he was 
in favour of that. 

The caterpillar jerked forward, 
and stopped. There was a higher 
whine from the engine. The wheels 
were turning, but the tracks were 
not gripping — you could hear the 
stones spinning under them. Cor- 
field gave her more power, and the 
tracks bit. The caterpillar moved 
up, skidding and sliding sideways. 
They were climbing the slope. Then 
she stopped again, with a more 
decisive feel to it. 

Dugmore took over — there was 
nothing to worry about but she 
might need coaxing. He revved 
high before he let in the clutch. She 
bounded, and covered about half of 
the remaining distance to the top. 
She stuck there, however. The 
pitch was a little too steep with this 
kind of loose scree. Only a little, 
but that was enough. 

Corfield said: “Now what?” 

“I suppose we could wait to get 
through, and then wait for a rescue 
party.” 

“Three weeks. Any brighter sug- 
gestions?” 

“Yes,” Dugmore said. “We’ll 
get the block and tackle staked in 
up above, and hook the spare 



motor to it. Run a hawser round 
the caterpillar. Pull and push at the 
same time. Dead easy.” 

Corfield nodded. “You’re the 
boss.” 

Working in their suits, it took 
over an hour. At least, Dugmore 
reflected, there was no need to 
worry about getting caught by the 
dark. The sun would not start 
setting for another twenty four 
hours. When it was ready, Corfield 
went up to handle the winching 
part, while Dugmore stayed in the 
caterpillar. He was near the edge of 
exhaustion. 

He had told Corfield to start the 
spare motor first and to gun the 
caterpillar as soon as he felt the 
hawser taking a strain. Corfield did 
so. The caterpillar moved serenely 
up the slope, poised on the lip, and 
came onto level ground. 

Corfield was visible a few yards 
ahead. Dugmore signaled to him to 
stop the engine, cutting his own at 
the same time. He heard the hawser 
grate against the side of the cater- 
pillar, shifting position. There was 
a harsh tearing spang of metal. It 
sounded expensive. 

Corfield came in through the 
lock. He said: 

“Bad luck. It’s the ...” 

“I know,” Dugmore said. “The 
track’s snapped again.” 

Corfield nodded. “At the weld.” 
Dugmore took a grip on himself, 
and breathed out heavily. 

“Ah well — back to the work- 
bench.” 



THE LONG NIGHT 



121 




D ugmore’s eyes were aching, 
their fatigue made worse by the 
blinding whiteness of vacuum light 
reflected from volcanic dust. Both 
his reflexes and his judgment were 
impaired by fatigue. He fumbled 
things. He had to re-do the first 
weld he made. Corfield stood and 
watched for a time and then, to 
Dugmore’s relief, wandered off, 
examining the terrain. Corfield 
stayed in view, of course: that was 
one rule no-one ever broke. Later 
he went back to the caterpillar to 
watch Dugmore add the final 
touches. He bent his head, making 
contact. 

“All right now?” 

“It hhd better be.” 

They went in through the lock. 
Dugmore said: 

“Try the radio again?” 

“Yes.” 

“No luck?” 

“I heard something. Garble.” 
“No matter. We’re on our way.” 
“You look shot,” Corfield said. 
“You’re overdue for the bunk. I’ll 
take her off.” 

Dugmore finished removing his 
suit. “She’s all yours. I don’t think 
I’ll need ear-plugs.” 

He had put his own cocoon in the 
narrow recess of the bunk. He slid 
into it, turning his face to the 
blankness of the wall. Drowsily he 
heard Corfield making the neces- 
sary connections. The engine start- 
ed, a good healthy note. Clutch in. 
Something was wrong. The engine 
w'hined on a higher note for a mo- 



ment, then stalled. Dugmore was 
filled with a murderous rage — 
against the caterpillar, Corfield, 
himself. He heaved himself up and 
out, and began dressing. 

Corfield asked: “Shall I try her 
again?” 

“I’ll have a look outside first.” 
“You don’t want to try her your- 
self?” 

“No.” 

“I'll come out with you.” 

He did not bother to reply to 
that. 



H e ex.\mined the track he had 
mended first. He could see 
nothing wrong. He went to the 
other side. The trouble was plain. 
A boulder was Jammed in the 
tracks, wedged in the space be- 
tween wheel and body. Visible, all 
right — but possible? He pulled at 
the boulder for a moment, then 
drew' back as if stung. 

The rock was hard, but not 
rock-hard. There was resilience 
there. 

Corfield’s helmet touched his. 
Corfield said: 

“What is it?” 

“You tell me. Not stone, anyway. 
Feel it.” He saw Corfield touch it, 
then the expression of surprise be- 
hind the visor. “The main thing is 
getting it clear. I’m going in for a 
crowbar.” 

When he came back Corfield was 
lying prone staring at the boulder. 
Crouching was difficult in a suit. 



122 



GALAXY 




Dugmore wedged the crowbar in 
and heaved. Nothing happened. If 
it had somehow been wedged in 
during that last ascent then it 
should have been forced out again. 
He tried again. The thing was in 
solid. Corfield touched heads with 
him, 

“Hang on while 1 get the drill.” 
While he waited for Corfield’s re- 
turn he decided there was some- 
thing wrong with the shape as well. 
It was too regular, too close in the 
sunlight. The surface gleamed with 
a faintly bluish sheen in the sun- 
light. He hit it with his hand — it 
yielded ever so slightly. 

Corfield put the edge of the drill 
against the thing and started up. 
There was no sound, but a faint 
vibration transmitted through the 
rock to the soles of his feet. He ran 
it for several seconds, and switched 
off. Dugmore stared at the place 
where he had drilled. Not the faint- 
est sign of penetration. 

Corfield’s head bent down to 
his. “Let's go inside.” 

Dugmore nodded, pulled at the 
crowbar to free it. He had to put his 
weight behind it. The odd thing 
was that it felt like overcoming ad- 
hesion rather than ordinary jam- 
ming. 

W HEN they were back in the 
cabin Dugmore said; 

“You’re the metallurgist — what 
is it and how did it get there?” 
Corfield looked dazed. “It’s not 
metal, nor rock either.” 



“Then what?” 

Corfield held out the drill. “I had 
the diamond head on. Didn’t touch 
the thing — yet it gives when you 
press it — just a little.” 

“Go on.” 

Corfield said slowly: “Two things 
emerge. One is that it has a differ- 
ent molecular structure from any- 
thing we’ve ever come across.” 

“The other?” 

“It could be alive.” 

“On the moon? No air, no 
water — how?” 

Corfield picked up the crowbar 
which Dugmore had put back in its 
box. 

“Look at this.” 

Dugmore stared at the crowbar. 
For eighteen inches from the end — 
that part which had been pressing 
against the boulder — there was a 
discoloration, a kind of blue smear. 
He looked more closely. Just barely 
visible, there was pitting. 

“Metal?” he asked. “Are you 
suggesting it eats metal?” 

“It would explain some things.” 

“The worms, you mean? A bit on 
the large size, to get into those 
holes.” 

“I don’t know. I’m going out to 
have another look at it. You could 
try raising Cairo again. Or Man- 
chester might be coming in by 
now.” 

“And tell them what? That 
we’ve found the local inhabitants, 
and that they chew iron filings and 
excrete rust?” 

“I think it might be a help to 



THE LONG NIGHT 



123 




have them send someone out from 
Base with another caterpillar.” 

“In case we can’t pry our little 
friend loose?” 

“Just in case.” 

Dugmore applied himself to the 
radio. Cairo offered a gale of noise. 
On the Jodrell Bank frequency it 
seemed a little better. R/T was ob- 
viously out of the question, so he 
keyed and waited. There was noth- 
ing. He was still straining to pick 
up an intelligible signal when Cor- 
tield came back in. 

He shook his head in answer to 
Corfield’s unspoken query, and 
said: 

“What about our little friend?” 
Dugmore asked. 

“Siderophagous,” Corfield said, 
“and siderotropic. Polymorphous 
with it. I suspect its natural shape 
is a sphere, which is the most con- 
servative of energy. But if you put 
iron-containing material near it, it 
throws out a pseudoped toward it, 
fastens on and starts absorbing.” 
“At what rate?” 

“A slow one, fortunately. It’s 
slow altogether, which I suppose is 
what one would expect.” 

Dugmore closed down the set. 
“If it’s slow, and that size, why 
didn’t we notice it before? I mean, 
you’ve been busy checking the local 
territory. You didn’t spot a bluish 
sphere, a couple of feet across?” 

“I saw it all right, only it wasn’t a 
bluish sphere then. It was a boul- 
der, lying on the lip of the crater. 
At least, the boulder is now miss- 



ing, so that’s my guess.” 

Dugmore wrinkled his brow, re- 
membering. “That can’t be right. I 
remember that stone: there was 
only the one. It was nothing like a 
sphere, and didn’t have that sheen. 
A chunk of rock.” 

“Try a cut with Occam’s Razor. 
The boulder miraculously removed 
as well as our lunarian sphere fas- 
tening onto the caterpillar? Better 
two improbabilities than one?” 

“1 don’t get it.” 

“Nor do I — but I’m feeling my 
way towards something. That sec- 
tion was in shade when we arrived. 
Let’s suppose the thing inactivates 
during the lunar night — goes to 
sleep until the sun touches it again. 
Then it wakes up and starts looking 
around for food. It can obviously 
mine iron out of rock pretty effec- 
tively. But the caterpillar offers 
more attractive scope. Something 
like one of us back home finding a 
living saucer composed of T-bone 
steak.” 

“The thought’s too poignant. It’s 
a good theory, but there’s one thing 
against it.” 

“Whafs that?” 

“If it tends towards a sphere 
shape as a means of conserving 
energy, surely it would remain in 
that form during the dormant 
period? That boulder was a pretty 
jagged piece of stone.” 

Corfield shrugged. “Protective 
mimiery perhaps. Who cares? What 
matters is that we’ve found life — or 
pseudo- life, at least.” He had the 



124 



GALAXY 




look of a child who’s just discovered 
that Father Christmas is real after 
all. “It’s fantastic.’’ 

“Yes,” Dugmore said, “I can see 
that. I’ll start cheering as soon as 
we’ve pried the goddam thing 
loose.” 

T hey weren’t worried, not yet. 

The thing did not look menac- 
ing, did not appear likely to be- 
come a threat. Corfield tried var- 
ious metal objects in contact with it 
and thereby established that it dis- 
played tropism only for iron and its 
alloys. The higher the iron content 
the more rapid the rate of absorp- 
tion, the highest rate being, Cor- 
Field calculated, slightly less than a 
thousandth of an inch per hour, 
something like a fiftieth of an inch 
per day. The caterpillar’s plating 
was half an inch, which meant they 
had twenty-five days before the 
thing ate its way through. 

On the other hand, the problem 
of freeing the track from its clutch- 
es remained obdurate. Various at- 
tempts at prying or pushing it out 
got nowhere. 

After an hour of this, Dugmore 
thought of heat. It could plainly 
take extreme temperature changes, 
but a touch of the oxyacetylene 
tlame was somewhat different from 
the sun’s radiant energy, even in 
vacuum. He set up the welder and 
directed the torch at that part of 
the sphere furthest away from the 
caterpillar. In a short time, the 
blue turned to orange and then to 



cherry-red. Nothing else happened. 
Corfield had another go at levering 
it out, with no result. Dugmore 
held the torch steady in one spot 
and the red brightened to a yellow- 
ish white. But that was absolutely 
all. Corfield touched a part of the 
sphere away from the flamed area. 
He made a gesture of negation, and 
another towards the airlock. Dug- 
more switched off, and followed 
him back in the caterpillar. 

Corfield was excited again. He 
said: 

“Quite a different molecular 
structure, obviously. Do you realize 
that a few inches away from the 
point you were burning the temp- 
erature was absolutely normal?” 

Dugmore stashed the welder 
away. He said: 

“1 say it’s spinach, and I say the 
hell with it. Look, I’m beat. I’m go- 
ing to get in the sack. Wake me if it 
sprouts wings and starts lifting us 
off towards Tycho.” 

Corfield said abstractedly: “Sure. 
I wonder if it would respond to 
magnetism?” 

“You find out. You might also 
have another shot at getting through 
to Base. I have a feeling maybe we 
are going to need help. Try Man- 
chester again — or Shannon.” 

C ORFIELD woke him with the 
usual hemidemisemitasse of 
coffee and steaming tin of scram- 
bled egg with diced ham mush. 
Sitting up, Dugmore asked: 

“Any luck?” 



THE LONG NIGHT 



125 




“No. It was an odd thing with the 
magnet, though.” 

“How so?” 

“It started putting a tendril out 
and then stopped and withdrew.” 
“You should have carried on. 
You might have got it confused.” 
“I didn’t think of that.” 
Dugmore reached for his sponge 
and began rubbing himself. 

“Don’t take it to heart.” 

“But I mean it. It might . .” 
“Forget it. What about the link? 
Any luck?” 

“None.” 

“Cape Kennedy should be in by 
now.” 

“I tried them. Nothing.” 
Dugmore sighed. “We’re still on 
our own, then, coping with our rav- 
ening monster. No other bright 
ideas?” 

“1 set up the camera to record 
it.” 

“That should win a prize for ac- 
tion movies.” 

“Single-frame at minute inter- 
vals. Do you think electricity might 
touch it?” 

“We could try. Or tickle it with a 
feather, maybe.” 

They manhandled the generator 
outside, hooked it up to the trans- 
former, managed to boost the 
output to two thousand volts. Dug- 
more held a contact against the 
sph ere, which seemed distinctly 
larger, bulging out more obviously 
from the track, and nodded to Cor- 
tield to apply the juice. This time, it 
didn’t even change colour. When 



Corfield cut, and came over to 
touch helmets, he asked him: 

“You sure it was getting 
through?” 

“It was getting through, all 
right. 

“Let’s go in and think again. 
Might be worth trying Berkeley, 
too.” 

Corfield tried to get through to 
Berkeley. The static sounded louder 
than ever, a storm of sound. There 
was no point in persisting. As he 
switched off, Dugmore said: 

“This is turn-round point, by the 
way. I just checked the clock. We 
ought to be on our way home by 
now.” 

“We’ve got a day in hand.” 

“Yes.” 

For the first time, Dugmore felt 
uneasy. If they did not get started 
on the return journey within twenty 
four hours the chances were that 
they were not going to make 
it — they would have to spend the 
lunar night in the open. And sud- 
denly that was a prospect not just of 
boredom but of something else . 

He started looking for tools. Cor- 
field asked: 

“What do you propose doing?” 

“I’m going to dismantle the 
track on that side. We might be 
able to do more if we can get a clear 
approach to it.” 

I T was not an easy job under the 
best of conditions; working in a 
suit made it harder. Dugmore 
sweated heavily and had to break 



126 



GALAXY 




off after a couple of hours and go 
inside to rub down. He stood the 
suit in the dehumidifier and had 
another try at radio communica- 
tion, with the same result as before. 
Corfield had tried half an hour be- 
fore. He realized he was beginning 
to get nervous. 

An hour later he was again 
soaked with sweat — but he had the 
track off. The thing was exposed, a 
flattened blue spheroid pressed 
against the metal side of the cater- 
pillar. 

It was bigger than he had 
thought, more than four feet across. 
He saw at once that the exercise 
had been futile. It clung tightly to 
the metal, as though part of it. All 
the same, he tried driving alumi- 
num wedges in at the side. No luck. 
When he tried it with a steel chisel 
it yielded; yielded — and held. First 
he tried to pull it out, then to knock 
it out with a hammer. Neither at- 
tempt succeeded. When he had first 
tried to remove it, it had not grip- 
ped the crowbar like that. Their 
beast had grown stronger. 

They went inside for conference, 
Corfield said: “It’s not going to 
budge, is it?” 

“No. There’s something else.” 

“What?”. 

Dugmore said: “If adhesion can 
change, maybe absorption can.” 

Corfield nodded slowly, “I’ll 
check that.” 

“While you’re doing it. I’ll try to 
raise Hawaii.” 

“It’s been a long time for a sun- 



spot flare, hasn’t it?” Corfield said. 

“Yes.” 

If they managed to put through a 
call for help it would take six days 
for a relief caterpillar to get to 
them; and that meant both parties 
spending the lunar night in the 
open. All the same, it would be a 
comforting thought to know that 
help was on the way. 

He called Hawaii, went on call- 
ing. Through the bubble he could 
see the globe of the Earth, a pale 
disk against the brightly hazed 
black of the sky. Late evening 
there. Maybe people were walking 
by the sea, watching moonlight on 
the waves. 

He listened to the crackle of the 
ether. Maybe the whole world was 
dead. He broke off as Corfield 
came back in. 

“Well?” 

He really did not need to ^sk. 
Corfield ’s face told him. But not 
exactly how bad. Corfield said: 

“Double” 

That meant twelve days instead 
of twenty five; presumably it would 
inactivate during the night. Six 
days for the relief tractgr to get out 
here. It was going to be close. One 
could live for forty eight hours in a 
suit, but no longer. 

Corfield said: “And, of course, if 
it’s variable, then it could go on 
varying. We don’t know that it’s 
reached it’s maximum.” 

“No.” The chill of fear for a mo- 
ment was the chill of the airless 
vacuum outside. “I see that.” 



THE LONG NIGHT 



127 




“I’ve had an idea, though,” Cor- 
field said. “We’ve been trying force 
on it. Persuasion might be more 
rewarding.” 

Dugmore said bitterly; “Promise 
it we’ll take it back to Earth and 
feed it cannon-balls?” 

“We could have a shot at luring 
it. We’ve got stuff in here with a 
higher iron content than the hull. 
Those tools, for instance. It might 
find a purer food source more at- 
tractive. If we could lay a trail away 
from the caterpillar . .1 agree it 
sounds unlikely. On the other 
hand ...” 

.“Sure,” Dugmore said. “On the 
other hand, anything is better than 
nothing. I’ll start collecting the 
gear.” 

T hey used the crowbar as the 
final link. Dugmore closed the 
gap with it. As it approached the 
blue spheroid the surface pulsed 
and a tendril rose out of it. It reach- 
ed the bar and started moving 
along it — not fast, but the move- 
ment was quite perceptible. From 
the far end it went on to a metal 
jack and from there to various tools 
placed end to end. The trail ran 
more than twenty feet. The fila- 
ment, Dugmore saw, was thicken- 
ing, first along the crowbar and 
then over the jack. And the 
spheroid itself looked slightly 
smaller. Crazy as the idea was may- 
be it was going to work. But some- 
thing else was happening: a lump 
of the same slightly gleaming dark 



blue as the rest swelled under the 
tendril and flowed along it to the 
crowbar. The nucleus? It moved to 
the jack, enveloped it. Then, be- 
tween crowbar and caterpillar, the 
tendril thinned and parted. The 
ends retreated from each other into 
their parent spheres. 

That made two of them. 

D ugmore persuaded Corfield to 
get some sleep, and made him 
take a pill to ensure that he did. 
Listening to Corfield’s deep, even 
breathing, Dugmore felt loneliness 
as a physical presence. More for 
something to do than out of real 
hope he fiddled with the radio, 
found the Tokyo frequency rela- 
tively quiet. Switching to transmit, 
he sent the call-sign LUN5. The 
burst of staccato dots at the end 
sounded like nails in a coffin. Lis- 
tening in afterward, he thought he 
heard a signal, but it was so weak 
that it might have been his imagin- 
ation. He transmitted again, and 
listened again. This time the static 
was back, and there was no hope of 
picking anything up. 

Dugmore spent the rest of Cor- 
field’s sleep period outside with the 
monster(s). He tried all the things 
that they had tried before. When 
none of them worked, he stood and 
looked at the two spheroids. The 
new one seemed to be growing 
faster that its parent. A function of 
infancy, or of pure iron diet from 
“birth”? He was not interested, he 
found, in such academic questions. 



128 



GALAXY 




His attention was focused solely on 
survival. 

C ORFiELD woke. They ate more 
mush and rehearsed about the 
situation. Neither of them came up 
with anything new. Their tempers 
were frayed and they began snap- 
ping at each other. Dugmore felt 
that he was more to blame, but he 
could not do anything to cool him- 
self out. His nervous tension was 
such that he could not stop himself. 
In the end, Corfield went outside 
and he concentrated on the radio. 
Static, nothing but static. He con- 
tinued to search the dial hungrily 
and hopelessly. When Corfield 
came back in, Dugmore didn’t 
bother to look up. But Corfield 
said: 

“1 checked the rate of absorption 
of the new one, to see if the higher 
iron content made a difference. It 
does. 7'he rate’s up.” 

“Write a book about it.” 

“And then 1 checked the first 
again. The rate’s up with it too.” 
Dugmore stared at him. “Are 
you sure of that?” 

“1 double-checked. At the new 
rate it will be through the hull in 
lour days, give or take the odd 
hours.” 

“So even if we get through, and 
they sent a relief caterpillar 
out ...” 

“Yes,” Corfield said. “Too late.” 
He found himself cursing insane- 
ly, a string of vituperation against 
the spheroids, the moon, Corfield, 



the indifferent millions who worked 
or played two hundred and forty 
thousand miles across space. Cor- 
field let him run on until exhaust- 
ed, and then said; 

“I think I may have the answer.” 
Hope paralyzed him. He waited, 
staring. Corfield said: 

“If it’s got a mind at all, it must 
be of a pretty primitive order — 
and it seems to activated by sun- 
light. Perhaps the reverse is true. 
When the sun goes down, maybe it 
reverts to that pseudo-boulder 
form. Unfortunately, the way this 
ravine runs, it will be another five 
or six days before the sun is off it — 
unless we provide an artificial 
night, rig up a sunshade.” 

“It can’t be as simple as that.” 
“Worth trying, don’t you think?” 
Dugmore looked around the 
cabin. “We can rip the bunk out 
for a start. Use the sides as 
supports.” 

I T was ridiculously easy. Nothing 
happened until the last ray of 
sunlight was obscured, and then it 
all happened at once. The spheroid 
seemed to shrivel and fell away 
from the caterpillar. Once again it 
was an ordinary, irregularly shaped 
chunk of rock. Felt like it, too. 
Dugmore prodded it with his glove. 
Not yielding any more; just a rock. 

He put both hands down on it, 
heaved. He rolled it along to the 
point where the natural shade took 
over, left it. Then they went to deal 
with the other one. 



THE LONG NIGHT 



129 




D ugmore said: “I can’t think 
why it took us so long to work it 
out. It seems so obvious.” 

“I’ve always been a bit weak on 
the obvious,” Corfield said. 

“Not as weak as I am.’’ He 
paused, considering this. “I won- 
der if I would have thought of it, 
before that damned thing chewed 
its way through. I’m not at all con- 
fident I would.” 

Through the bubble he could see 
the remaining segment of the sun’s 
disk. Otherwise no different from 
what it had looked like at the 
zenith; there were no spectacular 
sunsets here. 

They were still in the same place. 
There were two reasons for that. In 
the first place it had taken longer 
than they expected to put the 
damage right: the erosion had 
made the track difficult to fit. By 
the time the caterpillar was ready to 
go they were in communication 
with Base again. 

Their report of the spheroids, as 
they had expected, had caused quite 
a stir. The relief tractor would head 
toward them at the next lunar day- 
break, carrying a lightproof, iron- 
free container in which the two 
lumps of pseudo-rock could be 
crated. Meanwhile, they were to 
stay and keep watch. There was ob- 
viously no danger now, and in any 
case they could not have got back to 
base in the four days’ light that re- 
mained and they had more than 
adequate supplies to sit the night 
out. 



T he tape that was being played 
was some quartet of Beeth- 
oven’s; one of the later ones, Dug- 
more guessed, because it made 
even less sense to him than most. 
But he was not irritated by it, nor 
by the prospect of hearing it a 
dozen more times. Relief from the 
fear of death was a great mollifier; 
even several days later it came over 
him, a wave breaking and shower- 
ing him with a fine spray of aware- 
ness of the joy of living. 

Corfield looked happy, too. He 
sat staring out through the bubble 
with a remote half-smile on his 
broad face. His wife had come 
through on R/T from Cape Ken- 
nedy that morning, and told him all 
was well — she was expecting to 
have the baby sometime during the 
next week or two. They were, 
Dugmore gathered, a very content- 
ed couple. Lucy had not come 
through to him, but she scarcely 
would, with a divorce pending. He 
found he did not worry about that 
any more. What were those lines? 

The world is so full of a number 
of things, 

I am sure we should all he as 
happy as kings . 

The world was up there, waiting. 
The sun was creeping down, the 
long slow shadows were creeping 
towards them. Soon only starlight 
and earthlight would remain. A 
long night, but day at the end of 
it. ★

Part III of III 



WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

DEMETRIOS was born, under 
the name Adam Freeman, in 1980 
at Hesterville, Missouri. 13 years 
before the 20- Minute War and the 
following plagues which destroyed 
his family. Adam fell in with a 
party who believed things were 
better in the east. They traveled 
through heat and torrential rains to 
a place called Nuber. in the Cat- 
skills. During the journey a boy 
Adam loved, Demetrios Makarios, 
destroyed himself, unable to 
endure the collapse of his world. 
The boy 's mother refused to believe 
him dead and “mistook" Adam for 
him; he supported her delusion by 
taking the name Demetrios, and 
kept it ever after. 

Forty-seven years later, still at 
Nuber, he has become a street- 
corner yam-spinner, earning the 
rest of his living as janitor in a re- 
spectable sex-house in the “Outer 
City". Inner City is reserved for the 
aristocracy, the new rulers who 
support an uneasy monarchy and 
call the city-state a “King’s Repub- 
lic”. The water level has risen in a 
warming climate: wilderness has 
returned over most of North 
America where the sea has not. 

A fter giving some of his long-ago 
experiences as a streetcomer tale, 
and making a few radical remarks, 
Demetrios is informed by a police- 
man that he must get a license for 



stoiytelling at Town Hall before he 
does it again. The little crowd 
breaks up. but two members of it, a 
stable-boy. GARTH, and a young 
aristocrat. ANGUS BRIDGEMAN, 
will go with Demetrios to the ends 
of the earth, and Angus' wolfhound 
BRAND will be another com- 
panion. In a private conversation in 
the city park, Demetrios learns 
something of Angus' life in Inner 
City, which is precarious. He also 
recognizes the boy's quality and 
loves him. They agree to meet to- 
morrow in the same place. 

Demetrios returns to the sex- 
house run by MAM ESTELLE on 
Redciirtain Street. He shares a 
room there with his two closest 
companions, the PROFESSOR {a 
lute-player who never speaks) and 
SOLITAIRE, a girl Demetrios 
found wandering after her loss of 
memory. Mam Estelle and her 
helper BA BETTE are also close 
friends o f Demetrios. and he some- 
times helps entertain in the Parlor 
with his stories. It is a pleasant life, 
except that everything in Nuber is 
under the shadow of a medievalism, 
a returning dark age. Demetrios 
was the son of a doctor, and re- 
members an age when reason might 
have had a chance. 

In the morning Demetrios goes 
to the Town Hall to see about a 
license, and learns it costs more 
than he can afford. There is an im- 
pending shake-up: the Nuber 



133 




authorities are worried by a new 
sect, the ABRAM ITES — and all 
stoiytellers and other uncommon 
people are regarded as potential 
subversives. The Abramites are 
followers of the prophet ABRA- 
FiAM, martyred at Nuber 17 years 
before — the ever- recurrent Christ 
jigure who declares the earth must 
make way for the kingdom of 
heaven. In the past Demetrios has 
made a streetcorner story of the 
martyrdom — (he saw it happen 
himself) — and is suspected of being 
an Abramite. 

Inserted here is an excerpt from 
a diary kept by Mam Estelle, (and 
others will appear later). She 
rambles considerably, concerned 
with her own past as well as the 
present. She also was born in Old 
rime, indeed is somewhat older 
than Demetrios. In the 20-Minute 
War she lost her lovers and her 
baby whom she adored: she drifted 
to Nuber, worked in the sex-house 
and later inherited the manage- 
ment of it. 

(And occasionally you will en- 
counter remarks by “the one who 
writes this book" and who doesn't 
cpiite seem to be Pangborn — don’t 
worry about it.) 

After his disturbing intennew 
with a police lieutenant who 
specifically warns him against ever 
telliing the story of Abraham again, 
Demetrios goes to the park to meet 
Angus, who is not there. In his dis- 
appointment, and anger at the 
license thing, Demetrios gets a bit 



drunk, and defies fate by drawing a 
crowd and telling the story of Abra- 
ham, as it truly happened. The 
policemen appear as he is finishing, 
and he has a glimpse of Garth 
arriving, but not Angus. 

Demetrios is taken to the town 
lock-up without a hearing, and 
flung in the same cell with BOSCO, 
a wandering rascal who has been 
jailed for stealing a pig. Bosco's 
great wish is to get back to the 
Rambler gang (traveling tinkers 
and entertainers) that brought him 
up. He owes the Boss a licking for 
giving him one. 

The stable-boy Garth and his 12- 
year- old brother FRANKIE come 
to the jail after dark, promising a 
jailbreak later in the night. Garth 
has seen Angus, who escaped from 
a night of knives at the Inner City — 
the Abramites are being purged: 
Angus’ mother was involved on the 
side of the dictatorship. For all of 
them flight seems the only answer. 

Garth and Frankie return at 
midnight with Angus and the dog 
Brand: the jailor is overpowered, 
Demetrios and Bosco set free. On 
the road south of Nuber they join 
Solitaire and the Professor. Angus 
on his escape had gone to Mam 
Estelle’s to warn Demetrios that he 
was in worse danger than he 
thought: there he met and loved 
Solitaire: all are beginning to think 
of themselves as a Company. 

Babette goes with them a little 
way, spending the night with them 
at the “hant-house ” in the woods

south ofNuber; then she returns to 
Mam Estelle. The Company pro- 
ceeds through mist and uncer- 
tainty, down a wood-road which 
runs into a remnant of Old-Time 
blacktop, heading west. Solitaire 
has told Demetrios that she is preg- 
nant by him, three months along. 

In her diary. Mam Estelle tells of 
the early years of the sex-house, of 
MISTER FLEUR and his suicide. 

The journey haunted by mist 
deepens the affections of the trav- 
elers for each other, except for 
Bosco who is seldom concerned for 
anyone but himself. At one point, 
nearing a river that could be the 
Delaware, Demetrios is oppressed 
by fantastic sounds that seem to 
belong to the 20th Century; the 
others are undisturbed, having ra- 
tional explanations for them, which 
he accepts. The fog stays with them 
until they cross the river, and then 
they are solidly back in the Year 47. 
They move on to the conservative 
Penn town of Trottersville, where 
SAWYEF^ FINN’S Circus also has 
arrived.

It's our Covenant with Nature

night 

Sailed off in a wooden shoe — 
Sailed on a river of crystal light 
Into a sea of dew. 

— Eugene Field, POEMS OF 
CHILDHOOD. 



T he innkeeper at the Boar’s 
Head thought he might have 
heard of Gammo’s Ramblers — long 
ago, he couldn’t place it. “Someone 
at the Circus might know 
about’em — those bums get around. 
Jason Smallways has left’em have 
his back field for to camp 
in — Smallways never had no sense. 
Show opens tomorrow — no tent, 
just lousy caravans.’’ 

“I’ll ask now,’’ Bosco said. 
“Anybody want to come along?’’ 
“Sawyer Finn’s Circus did you 
say?’’ The innkeeper confirmed 
that. “I might go along,” said 
Demetrios. Frankie and the Pro- 
fessor added themselves; the rest 
were tired, or sad, or busy. 

They passed through the drowsy 
town — all Penn is drowsy, it’s 
partly the climate — to the animal- 
smelling excitement in Smallways’ 
back forty. Six mule-caravans were 
drawn up in a loose ring — yes, 
rather like the pictures you (should) 
have seen of Conestoga wagons in 
a defensive circle surrounded by 
war-v hoops. An acrobat was trying 
the stretch of his tights recently 
mended in the seat. A lank boy 
exercised two pretty horses. An old, 
old, square-jawed gentleman was 
testing a ringmaster’s whip, 
snapping it at the ground. A thin 
man with black handle-bar 
mustaches petted two sleepy pumas 
in a cage, and a fat woman sat 
grieving in the sunlight. 

Bosco went to talk to the youth 
with the horses. Demetrios,

Frankie, and the Professor ap- 
proached the old gentleman, who 
eyed them uneasily. “Another com- 
mittee to civilize us! I never see 
such a power of committees.” But 
he wasn’t unfriendly. 

“I never civilized anybody,” said 
Demetrios. 

“Now I look at you, I reckon you 
never did,” Bosco replied, “Who’s 
the boy?” 

'Tm Frankie, and this is the Pro- 
lessor. He doesn’t talk, but Miz 
Solitaire is teaching me to tell what 
he thinks.” 

The old man nodded. “Looking 
I'or a job, any of you?” 

“Depends,” said Demetrios. 
“We’re heading west.” 

“Be you the big boss?” 

“Naw, Frankie, I’m Vice-Presi- 
dent. Just H.F.” He called to one of 
the caravans: “OT.S.l Mister Vice- 
President! Company!” The Pro- 
lessor’s lute asked a question. “Oh, 
he’s the other Vice-President.” The 
lute inquired one thing more. 
“President? Why, how you talk! 
Wouldn’t have one on the place. 

(HI T.S.! . You know, it ain’t 
IK) use going west. Ocean, jungle, 
islands, fhe map ain’t what it 
was- you could throw a dog 
through it anywheres.” He shucked 
his frock coat, wiping off sweat. “1 
got to wear this at the opening to- 
morrow— for style, T'.S. says — but 
no use killing myself.” His blue 
jeans, like those Frankie and 
Demetrios wore, had patches at 
knees and rear. "Mister Vice-Presi- 



dent! What’s^one with that man, I 
wonder? Sleeps later every after- 
noon.” 

Two midgets appeared, man and 
woman, with another woman close 
to normal size, about four feet ten. 
The midgets were in faultless pro- 
portion, the dark-haired man three 
feet tall. The red-haired, blue-eyed 
women bore a facial resemblance 
affirming sisterhood. The man 
spoke in a voice of alto pitch: “T.S. 
isn’t asleep. His sore toe’s bother- 
ing him, but he said he’d be 
along.” He bow'ed in the stage 
manner, not in mockery but as if he 
enjoyed it: “1 am Nod, Minuscule 
Marvel of the Modern Mundane 
Masque. I have the honor to pre- 
sent my wife Wynken, and my wife 
Blynken.” 

“I’m Blynken,” said the taller 
woman. She dimpled, shaking 
hands. “Marriage is such a con- 
venience, now and then!” 

“I’m Wynken.” Wynken’s eyes 
were nearer soft green than blue. 

“We were the Cabot sisters of 
Lowelltown before we married — 
originally Kabotski of course — per- 
haps you’re not from Massachu- 
setts—” 

“Stuff it, Blynk,” said Wynken. 
“ I hese are friends.” 

fhe other Vice-President emerg- 
ed at last, in his own frock coat. He 
wore a dainty felt hat too. perhaps 
only for the sake of lifting it ex- 
pressively. He w as all courtesy, thus 
reminding Demetrios in no way of 
the 2()th Century. “I don’t know 



136 



GALAXY 




what H.F. is thinking of to let you 
stand out here in the sun. Do come 
into the caravan.” 

Nod said: ‘‘I thought I’d go over 
with — ” 

“Blynken to look at the horses,” 
said Blynken, ‘‘while — ” 

‘‘Wynken's always crazy about 
strangers,” said Wynken. 

‘‘Consound it,” said H.F., ‘‘they 
do that all the time. It’s like talking 
to somebody with three heads.” 

‘‘There’s a trick to it,” said 
Wynken, and she reached her hand 
up to H.F.’s as they walked to the 
caravan. Studying the newsfaces, 
she swished her long skirt and 
hummed to herself: 

‘“We have come to fish for the 
herring fish 

That live in the beautiful sea; 

Nets of silver and gold have 
we! ’ 

Said Wynken, 

Blynken, 

And Nod. ” 

Both old men w'ere white-haired, 
carved with wrinkles, eyes a little 
blurred at the iris. They moved 
carefully on thin legs — (T.S. gave 
no sign of martyrdom to a sore 
toe) — but they did not stoop; they 
were clear-voiced, pink-cheeked. 
Ihey graciously indicated which 
parts of the caravan floor were best 
to sit on. “We are embarrassed for 
furniture,” said T.S., ‘‘a bucolic 
sheriff having attached some of our 
choicest pieces, including a rocking 



chair to which I was much at- 
tached. It belonged at one time to 
my aunt. Of course it’s only a tem- 
porary inconvenience.” Wynken 
had served a round of corn spirit in 
little chipped cups. ‘‘Allow me, my 
dear — ” T.S. flicked a handker- 
chief over the floor where she was 
about to sit. 

Frankie nosed around like a cat 
in a new house, but he was already 
in love, obliged to sit down as far as 
possible from Wynken and become 
somewhat red and bug-eyed. 

‘‘Better times are coming,” said 
T.S. ‘‘Something is bound to turn 
up. It always does. Where are you 
from, sir?” 

Demetrios told the story of 
Nuber. Sawyer Finn’s Circus had 
never visited there, though Wynken 
said she and her sister and their 
husband knew' something of it from 
earlier years. And Demetrios told 
of Hesterville, of a culture that had 
died partly from self-hate. T.S. 
said: ‘‘Yes — yes — we hoped it 

wouldn’t happen . .” 

‘‘What would you think of going 
back west. Mister Vice?” 

‘‘Oh, I’m afraid we can’t Mister 
Veep. All changed — we wouldn’t 
know those islands. No public for a 
circus so far as 1 can see, and we do 
have to make a living, H.F.” 

‘‘That lute w'ould sure give the 
Circus a tone,” said H.F. 

“The Professor,” said Frankie 
(showing off some), “is thinking 
he’ll always go w'herever we go.” 
The lute agreed. Then Frankie 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY 



137 




yielded to inexorable forces and 
spoke directly to Wynken, forsak- 
ing all others: “How old be you?” 
“1 am as young as I am old, 
Frankie, love.” 

“1 guess that’s all right.” He 
studied his desperate toes. “Only I 
wish you was coming with us.” 

The lute spoke in the silence; 
Wynken was listening. She looked 
in disturbance to Demetrios, who 
smiled at her. By his guess she 
could have been anywhere between 
twenty and thirty-five’; midgets are 
uncanny. “T.S.,” she said, 
“Blynken and Nod and I have been 
talking lately about something that 
bugs us, only 1 wasn’t ready to 
speak up. It’s been on our minds — 
oh, ever since those yucks almost 
egged us back there at Betlam — ” 
“Cruds, every one.” But T.S. 
knew what was coming. 

“T.S., darling, we aren’t lucky 
for the show' and you know it.” 
“Land of Goshen, child! Non- 
sense!” It did not ring true. 

“T.S., we can't do much except 
flutter around and be small. And 
the yucks — oh — Blynken says she’s 
losing her knack with the fortune- 
telling — it never w'as her thing any- 
way. If she could be in our act — 
but she’s too big. Nod and I — oh, 
we dance, and we’re good with the 
horses because they like us. But it 
doesn’t go over. The yucks want us 
to be freaks. Oh, it w'as fairly tough 
when we were living in the woods, 
and you were angels to get us out of 
that, but — T.S., H.F., the yucks 



want to despise us. They want to 
think how' wonderful it is of them, 
not to be little people. If we could 
be awkward or ugly they’d like us 
well enough.” 

“Sho!”said H.F. “That caw’tbe, 
honey.” But he must have knowm it 
was so. “What’d we do without 
you, Mary Ja — Wynken?” 

“Oh . We’ll put on a good 
show tomorrow. Don’t worry. We'll 
sleep on it, talk again. I — ” 
Wynken ran out of the caravan. 
Glancing back at Frankie. Chick- 
ened out, you might say. 

[Friday, July 26] 
''HAT FOR do we try so hard to 
entertain people? There's two 
ways. For Money, like this House, 
where they come in uptight and we 
send them out pacified, almost like 
Sensible — like when my old Deme- 
trios used to go on the streetcomers 
and set his Cap by his feet. Or for 
love, like when Babette comes to sit 
with me and tell gossip things to 
make the Time pass if Fm blue or 
the Arthuritis is giving me con- 
nimptions or Fve got too much Tea 
into me. I'm bad Company then 
and I know it, but she comes any- 
way. bless her, and we fight over 
nothing till I feel better. 

Mister Fleur used to say to our 
Talent: "Look, Boys and Girls, it's 
not just Fun they want. They like to 
make it seem so because they know 
the rest lies too deep. What they 
need is to feel they're Somebody 
and that Somebody Else notices it.

And they want to be touched, so the 
World won't chill down to a cold 
Hurt and the Wind blow through 
'em, "he'd say. "And don't despise 
them neither for coming here, ” 
he'd say, "because that'd be despis- 
ing yourselves for being here, and I 
won't have that. Anybody works 
here is good enough for me, and 
that means good enough for the 
fucking World. " 

Maybe they could nail a man for 
talking so nowadays, the way the 
Righteousness is thickening up in 
Niiber like milk going sour in the 
Jug. We're protecting Democracy 
and Liberty these days, and that 
means you better walk soft and not 
bother the Brass. 

We got a new Musician, for my 
Money he ain't worth a Dam. 
Takes his pay mainly in meals and 
Trade, that's all right. Has a Gitter 
and does some songs pretty good, 
Old-Time Rock he calls them, he 
forgets I was a grown-up already 
when the original was still in Style, 
me and Sam and Stevie oftentimes 
laying around making love to it 
when we didn't feel like hearing 
real music. This is a N ice- Enough 
Boy, but for a Professor you don 't 
want a Boy, you want a man that's 
had Trouble and Joy so's to give 
him what I guess the Abramites call 
a Soul- Ripening. Babette she 
picked him up to ripen, someplace. 

I call him Joe which is his Name. 
The Girls can call him Professor if 
they want, not me. Taking it in 
Trade, he favors Gloria mostly, she 



being stacked the biggest. Yester- 
day morning / heard a Commotion 
in the Room where Demetrios and 
Solitaire and the Professor used to 
be, and there they was, him and 
Glorie, helling around bare-ass. / 
could see they'd been prying into 
things. I know we got to use that 
room for Business, but Babette 
hadn't finished doing it out. That 
bitch Glorie had spread out some of 
Solitaire's things that had to be left 
behind — to steal and sell likely — 
half her ass would be enough to 
split Solitaire's things. I chased 
them out with a Scolding, because 
it did give me a turn to see them 
grunting and frenching all over 
Demetrios' s Bed. 

Some of our Regulars are already 
saying, "Where's Demetrios, what 
about the Stories we used to have 
into the Parlor?" All Joe knows is a 
few flat old porn tales everybody 
heard before the year umph. 

/ started to say, I think Enter- 
tainment means building a Special 
Place, call it a Special World, 
where other people can come and 
forget the bloody one they got to 
live in Most of the Time. Like 
Mister Fleur made this place, and 
didn't little Shawn make a World 
too with his crazy Pictures? And my 
old Demetrios. Or maybe Tm talk- 
ing about something bigger than 
Entertainment, if there is anything 
bigger. No, I don't believe there 
could be any grander Occupation 
than making Worlds, especially if 
other people can come into them.

like I would have made a World for 
Marcus if I could. 

I N THE morning the Company ex- 
plored Trottersville, to kill time 
before the Circus. T.S. had given 
free passes for them all, and would 
have been hurt by a suggestion that 
he’d never get rich that way. 

Nobody gets rich in Trottersville 
except the Patrons, the landowning 
families, and they’ve already got it. 
Some artisans and business men 
like the innkeeper, who call them- 
selves Burjoyces, manage to stay 
comfortable. The Guilt Craftsmen 
run small shops, but all essential 
stores are owned by the Patrons: 
Welfare People trade there or do 
without. Angus, nosing around to 
learn things, was told the Welfare 
People are so named because So- 
ciety has their Welfare at heart. 
They rent small strips of land for 
subsistence, in return for spending 
two thirds of their labor time on the 
Patrons’ fields. It is a Free Democ- 
racy: in their free hours they may 
do as they please so long as they 
stay home. The penalty for a first 
attempt to leave the district is the 
loss of one ear. The second attempt 
is usually the last. 

Trottersville is in touch by fairly 
good roads with a nation in the 
south called Virginia, importing 
ideas as well as the tea, silk, and 
cotton we like so much, even 
though it’s produced by that slave 
labor which is totally unheard-of in 
the Free Democracies. The man- 



ager of the Trottersville Importers’ 
Guilt told Angus that the Welfare 
System had been working fine all 
through the Christian Era, and did 
he think he could figure out a 
better one? Also, if he wanted to 
criticize, him and his dog could 
gosemplace someplace else to do it. 

Angus wasn’t criticizing, he just 
wanted to find out. More and 
more, he said to Demetrios that 
day, he was wanting to find out 
things. An old hunger never satis- 
fied in the Inner City at Nuber — 
(except by the books!) “The people 
I knew couldn’t imagine I really 
wanted truth, if truth was any-way 
uncomfortable or unfashionable.” 
He sat over drinks with Demetrios 
at the tavern; the others were still 
out savoring the town and would 
meet them at the circus lot. “But I 
did want to find out things, Deme- 
trios, and I do. To find out why for 
instance that old war ever 
happened forty-seven years ago. 
And how different was it essentially 
from the war that’s bound to 
happen between Moha and Katskil 
in the next few years because both 
silly little nations want to exploit 
(he old mines near the borders?” 

“Weaponry is the main differ- 
ence, perhaps. We can’t destroy life 
on the grand scale any more, unless 
some new technology is built up, 
and there may not be the resources 
for that. The difference in 
\^eaponry makes a psychological 
difference. There’ll be small 
medieval wars, with man-to-man

and no button-pushing. But it’s

“Respect, not love. Thou art 
bitter, Demetrios.” Demetrios was 
not feeling bitter. He was suffering, 
but pleasantly, from the beauty of 
Angus’ hands, the gentleness of his 
mouth, a waterfall of light across 
his shoulder. “Thee and thou — we 
spoke that way now and then at 
Imier City. A some-time thing with 
me — you can even use it along with 
the modern way.” 

“1 like it. Angus. In Outer City it 
w as usually sneered at . Yes, re- 
spect. Love is for individuals. Who- 
ever claims to love humanity is a 
hypocrite or self-deceiver. We love 
men and women and children, not 
abstractions. But the concept Man 
is worthy of respect, and in a 
climate of respect something 
politically decent might some day 
emerge. The American states made 
a beginning at the end of the 18th 
Century, but couldn’t protect the 
achievement from watergating and 
other corruption . Nobody loves 
Man. poor monster. An artist 
doesn’t love his art, either — he lives 
within it and for it, is carried by it, 
but love has no meaning in that 
connection that 1 can see. 1 love, 
thou lovest — love is for thee and 
Solitaire — tell me, is it good be- 
tween you?” 



“Very good. Demetrios.” 

“It’s for Garth and Frankie, for 
Solitaire and me. For thee and me, 
Angus.” He covered the boy’s 
hands; they responded. 

“Is there the body’s need in it?” 
“I’m old, and yet 1 don’t think 
I'd care to die without having em- 
braced thee.” 

“ I hc serpent in Eden — wasn’t its 
name Jealousy?” 

“My God!” said Demetrios — 
“you’ve given me another story.” 
Angus grinned. Sobering, he 
said; “You told me once — it was at 
the Meadows, the day we 
met— that love is a country. I like 
that saying.” In Angus there would 
always be an observer, even a 
judge, but this took nothing from 
his warmth — rather, Demetrios 
thought, it was what made his ac- 
ceptance a beatitude. “A wide 
country,” said Angus, “with many 
roads, and no place to walk 
timidly. I’ll always need you, now 
and long after you’re dead, my 
friend.” 

S AWYER Finn’s circus possessed 
no tent, and so had made 
Smallways’ back forty like a fair- 
ground. An area had been roped 
olT where a slope of land allowed a 
low semicircular theatre. The 
public could settle there or stroll 
among the exhibition tents, after 
paying admission at the gate of 
Smallways’ fence, where Frankie 
and Solitaire w'ere watching for 
Demetrios and Angus; the others

had gone in with their free passes. 
“H.F. says it’ll be a real bully 
circus.” 

“But he’s worried, Frankie?” 
Denietrios asked. 

Solitaire kissed Angus and rolled 
her forehead on his chest. “Little 
cat,” he murmured, 

“Little pregnant cat. Denietrios’ 
fruit’ll be a man-child.” 

“They’re worried,” said Frankie, 
his underlip stuck out in bother. 
"Mr. Virgil says the yucks are 
coming in too quiet.” 

“I’m Mr. Virgil,” said the man 
with the handle-bar mustaches, 
who was attending the gate. No 
more folk were arriving; the crowd 
already inside was small. “1 have 
Ihe puma act, and it’s account of 
them we can’t let the dog in — I’m 
really sorry, he’s a beauty. Frankie 
has known me a long time — twenty 
minutes — so he figured you did.” 
“Up yours too,” said Frankie 
gently, preoccupied. 

“I’ll stay out here with Brand a 
while,” Angus said. “Then some- 
one else can take my place with him 
and I’ll go in. But he never pulls 
when 1 have him leashed.” 

"It’s the smell. It would make 
the cats act up.” 

"Sure.” 

"Nice if everybody was obliging 
like you.” said Mr. Virgil. “It’s a 
fact, they been coming in too quiet, 
like people do w hen they might be 
looking for trouble,” 

"Don’t see many kids,” said 
Denietrios. 



“Ain’t many in Trottersville. It’s 
that kind of towm.” 

Frankie said: “Can’t people just 
enjoy themselves and be nice in- 
stead of all the time trouble- 
trouble? Especially at a Circus?" 
With Denietrios he returned to the 
circus ground, but at a black tent 
marked with cabalistic signs he 
said: “Oh, that’s just old 

Blynken— ” and ran off about his 
own researches. 

Denietrios ducked his head to 
enter candle-lit darkness, where 
little Blynken sat alone at a table 
with two chairs, peering into a 
crystal ball. “Draw thou the Inner 
Curtain, that none may — oh, it’s 
you, hi! Draw' it anyway. It’s got a 
‘busy’ sign — pity most of the yucks 
can’t read.” She lifted off a 
spangled turban. “T.S. had this 
damn contraption made years ago 
for somebody with too much skull. 
I heard a rustling in it up there a 
while ago, like mice.” She tidied 
her tine red hair. “Sit. Is it filling 
up any out there?” 

"Not much. Mr. Virgil doesn’t 
like the look of it.” 

“Ay-yah, and he’s got experi- 
ence! Hold my hand, dear — if any- 
one busts in fni reading your palm. 
Or shall I, for real? Living does 
write on us, though not the way 
they think. What a nice old gar- 
dener’s fist! . Wynken was 
crying most of the night.” 

"Oh?” 

“Bundle of nerves, and today she 
and Nod must dance on horseback.

She wants us to go with your com- 
pany, Demetrios, if you’ll have us. 
So do I, so does Nod I think, only 
he hates quick decisions.” 

“It would be a joy to us. But we 
hardly know uhere we’re going, 
Blynken. ‘West’ is only a word, and 
the world’s round.” 

“Don’t you really, my dear? . 
Well, for us. the way things 
happen. Sawyer Finn’s Circus took 
us in at a time wdien we needed 
them but they didn’t truly need us. 
It was the old boys’ kindness. Mr. 
Virgil's wife is better at the fortune- 
lelling pitch than 1 am, but I had to 
111 in somewhere. Now' she takes 
care of the commissary, laundry 
and all-w hat-all — claims she prefers 
it. I feel temporary. T.S. and 
H.F. — God, sometimes you’d al- 
most think they were — ” she 
studied him, perhaps testing his ac- 
ceptance and compassion. 

“It would be a delight, any 
time," said Demetrios, “to talk 
with you about the different facets 
of truth. We’d never run short.” 

“And I could serve tea. Well, 
r.S. talks about retiring, but it 
wiuild break his heart. H.F. says 
more sensibly: ‘Looky, Tom, 1 been 
retired all my life and what good 
did it ever do me?’ But we’re a 
dilTerent sort of freaks, modern 
freaks at that. New-century 
people.” 

“Like T.S. and H.F. 1 live in 
both worlds, at home in neither.” 

“Where’s home, ever? We’re not 
at home here, w'e three, but — oh. 



it’s hard even to think about a 
break!” 

“Was that the only reason 
Wynken was crying?” 

“No, sweet man.” Blynken look- 
ed away, head tilted, listening to 
crowd sounds beyond the tent. 
“God. I wish I was small enough to 
be in their act! No, she was think- 
ing of Frankie, and of all young 
people the way they are before the 
world rolls over them.” 

“Nothing new'-century about 
that, Blynken.” 

“For sure, for true! It’s our cove- 
nant with nature — Wynken said 
that, last night: so much to enjoy if 
we can, and then return the raw 
materials. But — so short a tmie for 
being Frankie!” 

“ That other almost-question you 
almost asked: no, I really couldn’t 
tell you where our Company is go- 
ing. But 1 think, as an old man 
may. of a republic growing up, 
slowly, isolated for a while in a 
rather empty world with a number 
of slag heaps — growing up from a 
beginning made by this handful of 
Iiuman beings who are traveling 
with me. I didn’t choose them — 
that man Bosco will probably leave 
us to look for a certain Rambler 
gang— ” 

“I hope he does. I didn’t like 
him.” 

“Oh — probably no real harm in 
him.” 

“ There is,” said Blynken — “no, 
never mind. 1 may be wrong. Go 
on. tell me more, Demetrios.” 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

“Well, I didn’t choose them and 
1 don’t lead them — but the poten- 
tial of generous leadership is there 
against the time it’s needed. Love 
and chance drew us together, and I 
begin to see we have certain quali- 
ties in common, qualities that were 
never of much influence in Old 
rime: we are able, for instance, to 
love without jealousy. We can enjoy 
remaining separate beings while we 
cherish the community that we 
have with each other.” 

“Was jealousy so great a thing in 
Old Time?” 

“1 was thirteen, the year of the 
Crash. 1 saw little jealousy, but 
mine was a rare sort of family for 
the 1990s — they gave me education 
as well as love. The social tradition 
was loaded with jealousy, and there 
were still people who made a virtue 
of it. That had begun to change 
twenty or thirty years before 1 was 
born. Some of the young people of 
the 1960s and ’70s were able to 
bring peace and generosity into the 
sexual freedom that earlier genera- 
tions had won only partway and in 
bitterness. The Crash put an end to 
many bright promises. Well, our 
Company has faults, and we 
haven’t been much tested yet, but 
so far I’ve seen no cruelty or mean- 
ness, no grabbing, no greed.” 

“1 here’s been none with us 
three. Demetrios. Nod and Wynken 
and 1 have been natural lovers for 
more than three years.” 

“1 think it can happen only for 
small groups, small enough to keep 



sensitive person-to-person com- 
munication — that’s the heart of it. 
Old Time at its worst was an urban 
thing, unable to comprehend the 
importance of small groups. The 
mass communications that should 
have been a simple public service 
became a dominating horror of 
homogenized stupidity. The small 
groups themselves forgot their im- 
portance, yielded up the virtue of 
town meeting without a struggle. 
You’d think they could have 
remembered that the family or 
tribe or eommunc family is the ser- 
vant of the individual. It’s Franken- 
stein's original neeessary monster, 
and must not be permitted to turn 
on its maker, or hell is loose. The 
village, a larger monster, is the ser- 
vant of the family, and the far-off 
central government, if there must 
be one, greatest and ugliest mon- 
ster of all. is still by rights the ser- 
\ ant of the village, and ought to be 
in dircet eommunication with it, 
directly answerable. But in the up- 
roars and terrors of Old Time, this 
simple idea, the obvious essence of 
representative government, could 
scarcely even make itself heard. 
Impractical! Impractical! And of 
course it was. once the swollen 
political and corporate growths had 
become inoperable . Well, may- 
be what our Company starts with 
won't carry through. Making a re- 
public is a labor for the gods, and 
we aren’t gods. But 1 have this old 
man's thought, and 1 have my 
hopeful moments.”

“We need an island,” said Blyn- 
ken. “An island meeting certain 
specifications.” 

Denietrios was happy. Often 
later he would enjoy this ability 
Blynken has to take what you say as 
a creation to be shared, as if with 
your four hands you held up a new 
picture and considered, artists with 
a common devotion, what more 
might be done to make it live. 

The crowd noise changed. “Hell, 
that’s trouble!” said Blynken, she 
jumped up to fling open the 
curtain. “Stay with me, friend, and 
hang onto that stick.” 

S unshine hit their eyes. People 
were running in it — not many, 
but they were high with that ten- 
sion, that witless gap-mouthed 
hunger for a spectacle of disaster, 
which can make a few look and 
smell like a multitude. They were 
running and stumbling down 
toward the stage area, the level 
ground below the natural theatre, 
and dow n there, like flowers tossed 
about in a water-bucket, gaudily 
dressed Wynken and Nod were 
trying to keep their footing on the 
bare backs of their horses. Yester- 
day the beasts had been gentle 
snulflcrs; Demetrios had petted 
them, and seen Wynken and 
Frankie and Nod climb around all 
over them. Now they had gone 
mad.

ken’s beast choking. Nod’s venting 
a wild miserable scream. H.F. 



managed to grab the bridle 
Wynken had lost, and was thrown 
about like an old stick. Garth 
running to help him shouted to 
Demetrios: “The bastards spooked 
them — clods, with pepper! They 
think it’s funny.” 

As Demetrios hurried down — 
Blynken had already darted far 
ahead of him — he saw Wynken lose 
her balance and tumble asprawl of 
the horse’s tossing, writhing neck, 
saving herself wdth a clutch of his 
mane; and the crowd yelled with 
delight. One voice squawked out 
above the rest: “Make with the 
porn show. Baby! Strip!” Others 
took it up, finding a rhythm: 
“Strip! Strip! Baby, Strip!” 

Nod vaulted down. He wrenched 
his horse’s head around, and with a 
slap and a yell sent the beast 
running blind toward the spec- 
tators, whose laughter ceased. 
Somew here among them Bosco had 
just picked up somebody and 
thrown him at somebody else. 

By the watch on Angus’ wrist, 
the Battle of Trottersville began at 
3:01 P.M., Friday, July 26, 47, 
w hen he heard trouble and pushed 
through the gate with Brand a 
leashed storm at the end of his arm, 
reached a climactic point when a 
crow -voiced yuck hollered: “Let’s 
clean up the joint!” and a higher 
point when Angus hit him. It ended 
at 3:05 when Frankie jumped on a 
barrel and yelled: “Run for your 
lives! The pumas is loose!” 

I .S. later told Frankie that this

w as the noblest lie of the Year 47 — 
no, more likely the noblest of the 
decade, or say the century. It had 
cost Frankie almost sixty seconds to 
arrange it with Mr. Virgil and help 
him wheel the cage out of sight be- 
hind a caravan and cover it with a 
tarp. 

During the four minutes Deme- 
Irios’ stick had connected with at 
least one skull — he hoped it be- 
longed to the one who had yelled 
Tor a porn show, but there was too 
much dust to be sure. He witnessed 
Angus’ arrival with Brand, and 
rested a bit, panting but able to 
relish it when Brand tore off some- 
body's loin-rag before Angus saw 
I'll to restrain him. The man had 
looked almost like a policeman 
before he lost his modesty and ran 
lor it. but that could hardly be — 
likely Demetrios’ fevered imagina- 
tion. On the \\hole. a lovely tight, 
though too much exertion for one 
of his years. 

There were other head-smash- 
ings and arguments. Wynken had 
been able to jump down clear when 
Ciarth quieted her horse; H.F. 
scooped her up and ran with her on 
his shaky legs to the shelter of a 
caravan. After that Demetrios had 
the soothing impression of Garth 
and Angus hitting a lot of people, 
with aid and advice from T.S. 

But Frankie decided the day. 
After his shot it was all over. The 
beat and elite of Trottersville 
retired from the field like piss off 
the end of a dock.

Nothing is just too big, 
you can t look at it. 

And I turned myself to behold 
wisdom, and madness, and 
folly: for what can the man do 
that cometh after the king?

ready done. 

Then I saw that wisdom

Circus considered it intelligent, 
alter decent rcllection, to split, and 
the C’ompany gladly accepted the 
olTcr ol' a ride as far as the next 
cn^ssroads that led north. 

The farm of Jason Smallways lay 
to the west of Trottersville. Angus, 
Brand, and Bosco made a 
portentous progress back there to 
pick up the gear still at the tavern. 
Angus showed a black eye and 
Brand two red ones; Bosco was 
moved to roll his muscles like a 
bear; nobody bothered them. None 
of their stuff had been stolen except 
one ham, and Bosco said never 
mind, there might be some way to 
correct this. On their safe return, 
the rest of the day was spent in 
nursing bruises and readying for a 
departure at dawn. 

Night travel is unsafe anywhere

tiger come from. He has (folk say) 
attacked villages down there and 
carried off people, sometimes 
haunting a particular region for 
weeks or months like a burning 
conscience. Tawny stripes, they 
say, on a pelt like a cloud of white 
and cinnamon. The stripes melt 
into the colors of morning or eve- 
ning, and if you see him at all at 
those hours it’s probably too late. 

T.S. wanted to go north. He had 
a hankering to take the Circus all 
the way to Nova Scotia where the 
evangelines are, and though Deme- 
trios warned him they might not be 
there now — it’s the change of cli- 
mate, evangelines need the northern 
winters or something — still T.S. 
allowed he’d give it a whirl. But the 
Company wanted west — two moon- 
shines are as good as daylight, 
maybe. And it was that night, in 
the good quiet, with the drinks, the 
music, the campfire mood, that we 
agreed Wynken, Blynken, and Nod 
would go with the Company. 

That settled, T.S. kissed all the 
girls including Solitaire goodnight 
and pottered off to bed. H.F. sat up 
a while to hear Demetrios tell the 
story of how brown tiger might have 
come to haunt this part of the world 
where no such beast was ever 
known in the past. It’s a story of 
one of those mad saints who bloom- 
ed in such profusion in the dying 
years of Old Time. Not long before 
the war, this fellow slunk about to 
the zoos in several of the great 
cities, liberating the beasts under 



cover of night, burning off locks 
with what was called a blow-torch. 
Some believed he was not one man 
but a group of conspirators. One 
man, Demetrios thought. Anyhow 
the episodes ended after that one 
man, who kept a diary and called 
himself Jack the Liberator, was 
found gored to death by a Cape 
buffalo he had let loose. It’s a 
harsh, sad little tale — Jack had no 
love for the animals, he just hated 
the world — and your novelist may 
write it some day remembering 
Demetrios’ words, but not here. 
Among the creatures set free by 
Jack was a pair of Manchurian 
tigers, the female already heavy 
with young. 

H.F. went to bed too, not for- 
getting to kiss the girls. Bosco had 
slipped off somewhere, his absence 
for a long time unnoticed. All were 
comfortable and lazy, but even 
Frankie not yet sleepy — (our 
hero) — so in this hour the new 
members saw fit to tell their new 
friends something of what the 
world had done to them and they to 
the world, since they would now be 
sharing joy and trouble and love 
and danger with Demetrios’ people 
all the way to the other ocean. 

“Nod,” said Wynken, “was born 
Seiji Ohara, the last name being a 
good Irish one even without the 
apostrophe, as had been noted by 
his great-grandfather Seumas

of foreign names — that is, when the 
apostrophe dropped he was not 
after stopping to pick it up. Thus it 
came about — ” 

“ — that we skip a generation,” 
said Blynken, “arriving at the mar- 
riage of his grandson Stockton 
Ohara late in life to Teru 
Kamayatsu who in 1985 turned up 
in that course on The Socio-Ideol- 
ogical Matrix of Piers Plowman 
which Stockton was then conduct- 
ing at a well-thought-of university 
located in Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts. For some years they were 
childless. Stockton in his sixties, 
having undergone an unusual num- 
ber of diagnostic X-rays in addition 
to the atmospheric and other radio- 
active pollution which was politely 
referred to as normal, believed him- 
self to be sterile. In 1992 he retired 
from teaching, and the two went to 
live in the town of Hoton near the 
New Hampshire border, where they 
were when the war came. Though 
untouched by bombing effects 
apart from radiation, the town was 
severely damaged by the earth- 
quakes of the Year One, and deci- 
mated by the plagues. It was hardly 
more than a camp site in the ruins 
when, in the Year Four, there was 
born unexpectedly to Teru and 
Stockton Ohara a son — ” 

“ — who is now forty-three,” said 
Nod, “and looks it, being thus two 
years older than his beloved though 
garrulous wives. They were born, 
Wynken being the older by two 
hours, at another small but famous 



town in Massachusetts, in the Year 
Six. Their father Ignace Kabotski,

Poland in the European famine of 
1978 and who never — ” 

Solitaire cried: “But Wynken 
can't be over twenty-five!” 

“Love, I’m forty-one,” Wynken 
said, not looking at Frankie. 

“But with my crow’s feet and 
double chin I show it,” said 
Blynken. 

“You imagine them,” said Wyn- 
ken. “On me of course old 

thing is so small it doesn’t show.” 
“Anyhow what looks like my 
middle-aged sag is actually — ” 

“O beautiful!” said Solitaire. 
“This too.” 

“Maybe we can pop together,” 
said Blynken. 

“If 1 may now again intrude, 
their father Ignace Kabotski, a 
refugee who never did change his 
name to Cabot in spite of Blynken’s 
tendency to say he did, really a de- 
plorable inverted snobbery — ”

Wynken. “Even after the war the 
tow n was full of stuffpots. We grew 
up with ’em.”

out of early childhood, it was evi- 
dent that Wynken would be, as 1 
am, what people call a midget, 
while Blynken would grow to 
normal or almost normal size. 
Ignace believed in the virtues of 
learning, a conviction strengthened 
by the calamities of his century. He 
held that there are only two im- 
portant ways to avoid the conse- 
quences of folly; one, to act with 
wisdom; two, never to get born. 
Since wisdom is an acquired 
quality, he set himself with 
devotion to give his daughters the 
firmest and widest education he 
could manage under the difficul- 
ties, a training w hich — ” 

“ — even now' renders us cap-

could — Seiji was not a manageable 
brat. She still believed when he was

still felt the world ought to come to 
them; when it did, it might come 
with witness cruelty. Sitting still, 
waiting for better times, those 
ghost towns were easy prey for out- 
laws, wild folk, the new savages. In 
his fifteenth year Seiji was working 
with his mother in their corn patch 
when three horsemen came storm- 
ing out of nowhere and snatched up 
Teru. Seiji they flung aside — ” 

“1 bit the wrist of the one that 
caught me up and felt it crunch. He 
yelled, 1 landed in the dirt, and 
they were gone.” 

“Then he saw others of the band 
setting fires and butchering his 
neighbors for pleasure. He escaped 
into the woods, and was joined by a 
few survivors from Hoton and other 
ravaged towns. They formed their 
own wild crew. They valued Seiji in 
spite of his smallness because for a 
while he was fiercer than any giant, 
and quicker than the rest of them 
to learn woodcraft and hunting. 



His speed and silence in the wilder- 
ness are uncanny. He took part in 
certain acts of reprisal — ” 

“ — which he prefers not to re- 
member,” said Nod. “We never 
caught up with the men who took 
my mother. When I was seventeen I 
understood w'e were simply turning 
into bandits ourselves, no better 
than the rest. 1 left them, lived in 
the wilderness alone for two years, 
visiting human habitations as a 
listening shadow. 1 needed little. 
Arrowheads 1 flaked out from the 
flint, still do. Worth the effort — 
with my light bow I prefer them. 
When in need of something that 
couldn’t be had except by stealing, 
it was — ” 

“ — his whim to leave something 
in exchange,” said Wynken, “such 
as a rabbit pelt for a hank of yarn.” 
Mr. Virgil remarked: “Woe unto 
anyone else who talked in so.” 
“They don’t know the signals, 
man Virgil,” said Wynken. 

“I'hey didn’t murder me,” said 
Solitaire. 

“Well, you’re a sweet kid,” said 
Nod. “We make exceptions.” 
“Actually more than a whim,” 
Wynken continued, “for Seiji was 
then and is now more ethically de- 
cent than his wretched little wives, 
who seek to profit by his example 
yet make at times but a halting 
progress, hm. (You used the first 
person singular, Solitaire honey.) 
They had, it’s true, that education 
he mentioned, but it sometimes 
abandons them. It had, when Seiji

first observed them out of his forest 
invisibility, as they stumbled down 
an empty road without any idea 
where they were going, because the 
wits had been knocked clean out of 
them. At that time they could have 
been called temporary idiots. You 
see, Lowelltown also was wiped out, 
by sickness. We don’t even know 
what the epidemic was. There 
weren’t any Old-Time doctors left 
there; it may have been a new thing 
anyway — violent fever, rash, glan- 
dular swellings, sudden collapse. 
The town had survived the post-war 
plagues, diphtheria, the red plague 
of Year, Sixteen, but this one 
cleared the slate. I mean — every- 
one, except my sister and me, the 
beauty and the midget, explain it 
how you will. When we grasped 
what had happened we only 
thought of getting out, going down 
the road, no goal except escape. 
Blynken, whom I knew then as 
Sophia, wanted — ” 

“ — to die, or so I said, but you 
made me lie down in the shade, 
Miranda, and took my head in your 
lap and said to me: ‘No, you will 
live — ’ and so 1 lived. For a while I 
slept so deeply that one world fell 
away from me, though — ” 

“ — all the worlds,” said Nod, 
“may be full of illusion as well as 
truth, and their philosophers 
amazed.” 

"And when she woke Nod had al- 
ready come to us, standing there 
naked and beautiful, with his 
bow — ” 



“ — and hardly taller than you, 
Miranda. So my thoughts went 
racing down the millennia, every 
one of them a praise of life — ” 

“ — and the wind had played with 
the hair on your forehead while you 
slept, your breasts were white and 
virgin.” 

“And the first words he spoke 
after Blynken’s waking were: 
‘Come with me so we can care for 
each other and not be lonely.’” 
“Therefore I knew he was of 
finer substance than the gods, 
namely flesh and blood. And now I 
will explain our names, but I’ll do it 
in a subdued tone of voice because 
our hero, without whom Sawyer 
Finn’s Circus might well be lying in 
ruins, appears to have fallen asleep. 
The explanation is simple: our 
mother we don’t quite remember 
knew that funny old poem and a bit 
of music for it, and sang us to sleep 
w ith it, and so did our father after 
she died, and — ” 

“ — sometimes you sang it for me 
w hen 1 was drowsy in the hot after- 
noons or the nights in the forest 
and the other places we’ve knowm, 
so that 1 learned it. And 1 sang it 
for you, Wynken, when sleep 
abandoned you in the bad time 
after our baby was lost. Then when 
we happened on the Circus, and 
T.S. so kindly invited us to join 
Ihem, and asked our names, we 
thought, why not name ourselves 
after a fragment of Old-Time 
fancy? Though it’s true that we are

peare is not for all occasions, and —

for sure. Sounds like a very small 
porpoise.” 

“Where did you ever — ” 

“ — hear a very small porpoise?” 
“In your dreams.” 

[Saturday, August 24] 

I t’s more than a month my old 
Demetrios has been gone, and 
sometimes Babette and me play 
wonder-what about what’s happen- 
ed to them. But that Game can't 
feed on Nothing. Babette said to- 
day, Nothing is just too big, you 
can't look at it. 

Professor was the First. Seems to 
me it was twelve years ago he 
turned up on my back Porch with 
his Lute, and played, and looked at 
me in his Particular Way. And was 
it ten years ago Demetrios came to 
me? — I get mixed. Before Babette 
anyhow. Solitaire was here only two 
years, but I did Love her more than 
any of them knew. Not wanting to 
get in bed with her like I've done 
with Fran sometimes, not Motherly 
neither but still a wanting- to- help 
Love, for it was strongest in the 
Times when she got wild, it was like 
seeing an Angel in a Spiderweb. 

Me and Babette pretty well 
know, though we don 't say it, that 
we ain't likely to see those three 
again, nor Garth and his 
cockahoop little Brother, nor that 
young Ristacrat — he was all right, I 
liked him. I think he’ll do Solitaire 
good, anyway he'll try. And that 



Character Dimmy picked up in the 
Jail, Babette said he was the Practi- 
cal Type. Well, but if they do come 
back it won’t be soon, and there’s 
that lump in my right breast. 

I hope I don’t go talking to 
Babette about that just for lone- 
someness, because what could she 
do? There ain't an Old-Time Doc- 
tor in all Nuber, and any new-time 
Surgeon likely makes his living as a 
Barber, they can Keep That. I be- 
lieve / can wait my time without too 
much fuss, / wouldn’t be the First 
and won 't be the Last. Why would 
anybody be a fraid of Death unless 
he’d talked himself into thinking 
there's an afterlife? I couldn’t do 
that. I tried, after Marcus, was still 
trying when / came to Nuber, 
though Myself kept saying to me in- 
side, You Fool, it ain’t wishing any- 
thing will make it so. 

Mr. Fleur he knew how it was 
with me. He said to me, quiet and 
kind, he says, “Stell, you ever black 
out?” I said yes I had, couple 
times. He says: “It has to be like 
that. No blood moving in the Brain 
nor breath in the Lungs, why, no 
Thinking, no Feeling. No Thinking 
and Feeling, no Person. Don ’t de- 
spise the Body, Stell, ” he says. “No 
Body, no Mind. "I've been quiet in- 
side about it, since. 

Dying, yes, we can be excused for 
hating that, that seems like a bad 
Animal coming after you. But more 
than half of that is just Funk, like 
being afraid of the Dark. I guess

anyhow know it won't be long. 

Lately I’ve took to the habit of 
carrying a Stick to lean on when I 
go out into my Garden, I know why 
it was Demetrios liked to have one, 
only forme it's the Arthuritis made 
me think of it. Suppose I write 
about Something I seen in the 
Garden a while ago, when I was 
Poking around. 

That fella Joe is doing a mite 
better on the Janitor Work, but he 
don't so far give the Garden no 
more than a Licking and a 
Promise. Babette she keeps after 
him, tries. He can always find new 
ways of resting onto the job. Some 
places that my old Demetrios kept 
neatened up has already gone to 
weeds in the time he's been gone. I 
tell Babette, Don’t sweat Joe too 
much, he’s got to ease into it like 
Gradual, and maybe weeding does 
bother his Gitter Fingers. Maybe it 
do, she says, only Professor never 
minded pulling weeds, he’d do it 
for love, not ast. Joe ain’t Pro- 
fessor, I said to her, so let him grow 
up a little. Anyhow — 

There’s this stretch in the Border 
where Demetrios has set out Lilies 
for me, time to time, some the 
neighbors have give me and some 
he ’s found around the Countryside 
where Old-Time people used to 
have Gardens. There ’s early-bloom- 
ing white ones, and some big frag- 
rant Whites with a goldy center, 
Regals Demetrios called them, and 
a fawny tan one, and of course the 
common kinds too, some being 



Day-Lilies and Tiger Lilies like I 
remember growing wild in Rae- 
burn. Sol was out there in the deep 
Sunlight leaning onto my cane, and 
thinking back I suppose— that’s 
natural. Then I seen how the grass 
and wild convolvulus and Things 
had gone to growing thick where 
Joe hadn 't done nothing. So I felt 
bad about that, I even started for to 
reach and pull, but the Arthuritis 
knocked that idear out of me, fast. 
But further down the Border I 
come on a gaudy common Tiger 
Lily standing in the sun with his 
sword-leaves and funny black 
knobs and his buds opening out 
full. There was this convalvulus 
wropping itself around him, and a 
Catmint crowding him along with 
the rank Grass. He just stood there 
looking like my old Demetrios. He 
didn ’t mind, he made me think of 
any good man or woman in the sun, 
with a burden but carrying it, and 
with Time left over to recognize me. 
That was all — I felt better and went 
hack in the House and had my Tea. 

It 's only the having to stop that 
gripes me. Having to stop even the 
small things, the good Breakfast or 
a touch of the Corn Spirit, or Music 
heard someplace down the Street, 
or seeing a new Face with some- 
thing sweet in it, or an old face with 
something New. 

But we stop.

least so far as the man’s physical 
safety was concerned. H.F. — not 
sleeping well these days, he said — 
emerged in night-shirt and slippers 
to help them worry'. He had been 
sorry not to be able to tell Bosco 
anything useful about Gammo’s 
Ramblers. Some three or four years 
ago the Circus had entered a town 
up in northern Moha which had 
otily just donated all its loose 
change to a Rambler company of 
that name, and T.S. had taken 
pains to learn what way the Ram- 
blers had gone, so as not to meet 
tliem again under those conditions. 
Gammo’s Ramblers were heading 
west, but that was all he knew; 
Bosco had taken it philosophically. 

Bosco returned at about mid- 
night, soft-footed, with a ham 
under his arm and a chicken car- 
cass dangling. “Could even be the 
same ham,” he said proudly. See- 
ing Demetrios’ distress, Angus’ dis- 
approval, Garth’s startled anxiety, 
Bosco grew sulky. “Well, I Figured 
the chicken’s a sort of commis- 
sion — you know?” 

“Seeing what they done about 
your ham,” said H.F. uncomfort- 
ably, “1 reckon you could say tit for 
tat. still it don’t seem just right, 
Bosco. T.S. ain’t going to like it. 
T.S. is going to call it stealing, a 
body shouldn’t do it. Did you have 
to bust into a house?” 

“Woodshed,” said Bosco meekly 
enough, perhaps respecting some- 
thing venerable in Demetrios as 
well as in H.F. But the meekness it- 



self was not pleasant. For some 
time Demetrios had been finding it 
difficult to adjust his republic to 
the presence of Bosco as a citizen — 
but then, where was the republic? 
“Jasus!” said Bosco — “I figured 
you'd be pleased.” Nobody said 
anything. Bosco searched Garth’s 
face with especial intentness, and 
got no comfort from it. “Well, 
jasus, you going to be down on me 
just for picking up something, may- 
be I better skin out. I won’t stick 
around where I ain’t wanted. I can 
just take my ham and my 
god-damn chicken and by God 
split." 

“No need of that,” said Deme- 
trios. and wondered if he meant 
that at all. Leadership was not in 
him. 

“So long as you know,” said 
Angus, “how the Company feels 
about it, stay with us, Bosco. Stay 
and learn our ways.” No one of 
them before, so far as Demetrios 
remembered, had spoken of The 
Company in just that way, with that 
authority. He could not have done 
it himself without selfconscious- 
ness. 

“Well, Jasus — ” Bosco was un- 
likely to learn much, but Angus 
might have said the most assuring 
thing as well as the right one. 

“We done things thataway,” said 
Garth, “we’d be in hot water all the 
time, Bosco. We got to treat people 
by rules they understand, right? 
l.ike if a bunch of ’em come after 
you now for busting into that shed, 



154

cvcrybody’d get hurt, and maybe 
^^ c couldn’t turn them pumas loose 
a second time.” 

That seemed to reach Bosco. He 
rumbled miserably, flung down the 
ham and chicken, brushed his 
hands. “Well, Jasus — ” 

“1 figure,” said H.F., yawning, 
"you was tempted beyond your 
strenth, Bosco. It’s a noble ham.” 
Bosco allowed his feathers to be 
smoothed; the Company went to 
bed in peace. We lent a hand 
gelling the circus wagons under 
\\ ay at dawn (Bosco working harder 
lhan anyone) and rode along in 
them all through the morning. 

Al about the noon hour we 
hailed by a crossroad for a meal 
wilh ham in it. Then, after many 
loving farewells, after T.S. had 
scrupulously paid their back wages 
lo Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, and 
gol a receipt for it, after T.S. and 
H.l-'. had kissed all the girls (Blyn- 
ken blubbering a little bit). Sawyer 
I inn’s Circus took the northern 
road, and though the road leading 
west dimmed out in grass, we found 
others after a while. It is not hard 
to travel by the sun. When the sun 
goes down in glory it’s time to 
sleep; when it rises all you need do 
r hold it behind you till the noon, 
and rest, and go on to the end of 
ihe day. 

AS YOUR novelist, I too regret that 
you should be somewhat 
losing awareness of Demetrios' 



viewpoint. But viewpoints — {what 
an odd. inaccurate word!) — view- 
points do fade, even cease. It en- 
gages my vanity that I have been 
able to give you as much of his as I 
have — but there, I knew the man 
well, as they say, and spent many 
hours in talk with him, rambling, 
observing, questioning in my sly 
manner, so that if there's anything 
in his life, even from the faraway 
beginnings in Hesterville and 
including the details of the years in 
Nil her, the fun and troubles of the 
sex- house, the garden he tended, 
the worries over Mam Estelle and 
her tea or the sound of Elizabeth of 
Hartford beating up a cookie batter 
with an Old-Time spoon and 
howl — if there's any of that I don't 
either know or have snugged down 
in my notebooks, it's hardly worth 
mentioning. The notebooks made 
up a good deal of the weight in my 
hac-pac till / talked Garth into 
carrynng some o f them for me. I be- 
lieve I told you Garth couldn't 
read. Angus and Demetrios fixed 
that, and he was a quick study, not 
a passionate spark like Frankie but 
bright and eager for discoveries, 
hut my tiny marks in the notebooks 
are a shorthand of my own. Be- 
sides, Garth was always a sweet 
kid. and wouldn't have peeked 
without permission. I could use his 
viewpoint — (some time I intend to 
inalyse that word; not as absurd as 
"standpoint" but still pretty 
crazy) — his viewpoint too if I was 
ainind to: an adolescent boy is not 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY 



155 




really any more fantastic than other 
warmblooded animals. 

D emetrios’ viewpoint — (the 

reader may now supply his 
own exegesis, since the novelist is 
out of sight again) — was becoming 
somewhat clouded by forgetfulness, 
that mental cataract. There was 
also the worm of pain that more 
often made its journey up and down 
in his belly and probed more 
detestably, and the presence of this 
creature was bound to color his 
thoughts. 

A morning came when the rain 
fell lightly. It would not have inter- 
fered with the Company’s traveling, 
but Angus decided that they should 
rest that day, and so they stayed in 
the shelter of a fine stone barn that 
stood sound where no house was. 
Rain ceased and the sun appeared 
in early afternoon, but Angus said 
it was too late to start, also he 
thought Brand was slightly lame 
from the chase of yesterday when 
Bosco had failed to bring down a 
deer with the first arrow. Bosco had 
been using a new bow Garth had 
made for him — Garth handy at 
anything, and Frankie ever-present 
with the sacred hatchet — and had 
been in too much haste for good 
shooting. “So let’s loaf the rest of 
the day and chew venison,’’ said 
Angus. “The western ocean will 
wait for us.’’ 

It never occurred to Demetrios 
that the rest was being called on his 
account, nor did he notice that 



when they continued the following 
day, travel was slow, with 
numerous halts. 

He enjoyed the new pace, enjoy- 
ed the heft of his walnut stick, en- 
joyed resting in the sun with his 
back against a tree-trunk. Someone 
was always with him, he noticed — 
Solitaire, very often Wynken with 
her small voice and curious green 
eyes, occasionally Frankie with not 
much to say, but most often Angus, 
who was never far off even when 
someone else was keeping him com- 
pany. 

One day the Professor and Angus 
were sharing the sunlit shaft of a 
broad oak with him when he 
noticed Solitaire in conversation 
with Blynken, and he saw that Soli- 
taire was disturbed. But it was not 
one of her trouble-times. In fact, 
unless his tiresome memory was be- 
traying him (and he had found that 
it was already interfering with his 
telling of stories). Solitaire had not 
gone through any of those storms 
since the little episode on the ap- 
proach to Trottersville. And now 
she merely looked excited, like one 
who has stumbled on something 
pleasant — a coin shining in the 
road, a friend’s face in a crowd of 
strangers — and Demetrios heard 
her say: “Oh yes, Blynken, do let’s 
pop together, and you can name 
your baby after mine, and I’ll name 
mine after yours, but Blynken, 
love, don’t ever call me Solitaire! 
Who was she, this Solitaire! There 
was never any such person, only

XIV 

When I’m Building 
I'm Right with Myself 

But we are spirits of another 
sort. — Shakespeare, A MID- 
SUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM. 



W E CAME by this slow travel in- 
to a region where the air held 
an odor of salt and seaweed, as it 
sometimes does at Nuber or in the 
eastern nations when the wind 
blows from the Atlantic, the ocean 
that no one crosses in our lifetime, 
perhaps for many lifetimes to 
come; but here in the place where 
Penn has no border, where the 
known and the wilderness come to- 
gether with no more sign of joining 
than there is in the coming together 
of the sea waves, the wind was 
blowing out of the southwest, and it 
was warm. “Salt marsh maybe,” 
said Bosco. “But I can tell you it’s 
durn-much like the air I smelled 
near the coast of the Freshwater 
Sea that ain’t fresh, that earth- 
quake country of western Moha. 
I'd think I was there if I didn’t 
know we’re way to the south of it.” 
It was the coast of the inland sea; 
nothing else could be so immense, 
so overwhelming with the sense of 
eternity — and yet it was new, an in- 
llowing of risen waters where 



recently there had been farmland, 
forest, cities, roads. New, and 
old — in earlier millennia, Deme- 
trios had told us, a shallow ocean 
had covered this land for immeasu- 
rable centuries. We were already 
somewhat south and west of Penn, 
perhaps. Demetrios had said we 
would not pass through the town of 
Aberedo. When Nod asked him 
how he could be sure of that, the 
old man’s answer was doubtful. He 
said his journey — (he must have 
meant the journey of all of us) — led 
through time as well as space. 

“So does the journey of a rock,” 
said Wynken, “as the turning earth 
carries it, and the earth’s orbit 
moves with the galaxy.” Demetrios 
looked on her with kindness and 
some amusement. Wynken is not to 
everyone’s taste, but they had be- 
come close friends. Demetrios 
would have carried her when her 
little legs grew^ tired, but in these 
days he had not quite the strength; 
the others w ere burdened with their 
bac-pacs and similar gear. 

“Let Brand carry you,” said 
Angus, and sometimes Wynken 
did, riding his back for short dis- 
tances, the gray hound walking 
proudly and laughing with his 
tongue at the side of his mouth. 

But at this coast our walking had 
come to an end. A town stood here, 
w ith no people in it, and the ancient 
highway that had brought the 
Company to it ran down into the 
sea. No people at all. An empty 
square, most of the houses fallen in 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY 



157 




and some overgrown with vines, old 
street signs dangling, a few. 
Beyond the abandoned square, into 
a once-paved open area where even 
now few seeds had been able to ex- 
ploit the cracks and make them 
useful — I think it was what Old 
Time called a parking lot — into 
that desolate open space the waters 
came white-tipped and whispering. 

In the west the sea met the hori- 
zon, though at the southern section 
of that arc a rise of hazy blue sug- 
gested the presence of land. The 
sun was shining from behind us on 
that hinted island, for we had come 
to this place in middle morning. 
We saw the strong light touching 
what may have been a cliffside or 
waterfall, and Demetrios described 
this for Angus. Then they moved 
further away, and I saw them 
standing at the very edge of the 
small waves, Demetrios still speak- 
ing, but too low' for me to hear, his 
left arm over Angus’ shoulders, his 
other hand w'ith the oaken stick 
pointing here and there — but it waS 
Demetrios whom the boy’s near- 
sighted eyes were watching, with 
trouble and tenderness; and it’s 
true that island to the south was so 
far from us you’d think only a 
dream could reach it. 

Now earlier that morning we had 
passed an old signboard carrying 
several names, with figures after 
them indicating distances, and it 
seems to me that one of the names 
may have been Aberedo. Yet 
Demetrios did not speak of it, and 



he looked on this ruin of a town 
with no sign of sorrow or recogni- 
tion, asking Garth — possibly he 
meant it at first only as one of his 
mild jokes — whether he knew how’ 
to build a boat to go on with. 

“No, man Demetrios,’’ says 
Garth, serious as always, “but you 
tell me how', and if it’s made of 
wood and 1 ain’t hurried, I believe I 
can do it.” 

“September’s a-going toward 
winter,” said Bosco. “Couple 
months, like. Shelter of a house, 
even one of them w recks, would be 
handy, if it takes till cold weather 
to build your boat.” 

“What about repairing one 
house to live in,” said Nod, “in case 
we're still here w'hen it gets chilly, 
and using the rest for lumber to 
build our boat?” 

He said “our”; Boseo had said 
“your”; likely the whole Company 
noted it. 

We discussed the idea comfort- 
ably through a lunch that was em- 
bellished by apples from someone’s 
long-ago garden, w'here we sat pro- 
tected from a brisk damp ocean 
wind. It seemed a good idea: prac- 
tical, reasonable, and foolish 
enough to be interesting. “If my 
baby is born at sea,” said Eve who 
had been Solitaire, “he’ll live long 
and always be safe in a storm. It’s 
an old Lowelltown superstition, 
right?” 

“Tell ’em how old,” says 
Wynken. 

“A day old. Blynken made it up 



158 



GALAXY 




for me yesterday while we were 
cooking bacon and comparing 
bulges.” 

“Hours and hours and hours 
ago,” said Blynken. “Mine are 
bigger than thine.” 

“Phoo.” 

“1 can’t help it,” said Nod, “I 
love all those women. Well, I’m in 
favor of the boat. We’ll need 
smoked meat. I’ll be hunting while 
Garth is building.” 

“We want an island. Demetrios 
and I were getting that settled when 
Frankie turned the pumas loose.” 
“And rode the big one three 
times around the lot,” said 
Frankie. “Don’t leave that out.” 
“That island we see from here,” 
said Demetrios, “is not really far 
away. Maybe we’ll want something 
further off. If there’s to be another 
republic — another attempt to make 
a republic — it might need to grow a 
while, undisturbed by the efforts of 
worried strangers to destroy it.” He 
looked at the Professor, who was 
usually ready to confirm or deny 
the good sense of his remarks; the 
Professor nodded. “Let our island 
be one not too easily discovered,” 
said Demetrios, “and large enough 
to support a few hundred or a few 
thousand souls with a taste for love 
and a taste for privacy.” 

T hus it was agreed — though 
Bosco made a production of 
saying damn-all nothing about it 
one way or another — to build a 
boat. 



Garth examined the gaunt gray 
structure that was sheltering us 
from the sea wind, Frankie close by 
him in case he needed the Hatchet. 
He kicked the clapboards, sounded 
the walls. “This one might do to 
live in,” he said, “And we’ll find 
stuff here and yonder, for the build- 
ing.” Then he and Frankie went in- 
side the place to consider beams, 
studs, floor-boards, the state of the 
roof, while the rest of us explored 
the town. 

Demetrios was attracted by a 
heap of rubble where he glimpsed 
on a charred signboard the letters 
DWARE. He poked with his oaken 
stick, uncovering a hammer rusted 
but not spoiled, w'ith a metal shaft, 
and a grip still covered by a good- 
handling material unknown to us. 
The hardw are shop must have been 
burned before the looting was 
finished, and its treasure buried 
from sight under plaster and trash 
and charcoal. Bosco and Nod 
helped us. We grubbed and be- 
sooted ourselves in the ruin, 
winning two hand-saws still with a 
coating of the manufaeturer’s wax, 
some barrels of nails, a two-edged 
ax, an auger with a set of bits, a 
draw-shave. There was of course 
much intricate gadgetry that Deme- 
trios recognized as eleetric, which 
we tossed aside. 

Returning to our house and 
garden, we found Garth and 
Frankie already engaged in reno- 
vating. The front room possessed 
an enormous w indow of heavy glass

amazingly unbroken. Other win- 
dows, gaping and forlorn, could be 
boarded up against winter winds, 
and through the great Old-Time 
window we could watch the ocean’s 
changes when the sun w-ent down. 
The chimney was sound, the fire- 
place in that main room large 
enough so we could cook there, and 
the room would also accommodate 
our sleeping gear. We noticed signs 
of rats, but after Brand had spent a 
night or two with the run of the 
house we heard no more scampering 
in the walls. 

Garth with our loot from the 
hardware store was a happy man. 
His happiness spread about him, as 
light will, touching Blynken with a 
particular radiance. “With that 
stuff we can go on a ways,’’ Garth 
said. “Aye-so, when I’m building 
I’m right with myself.’’ Later, after 
his work routines were established, 
and the mild winter brought certain 
days of rain when he could not 
work on the boat. Garth made us 
more of those small carvings which 
to him seemed nothing wonderful. 
For Blynken he carved a swan with 
lifted wings, and she said in the 
same hour that she hoped Garth 
would father her next child. It is 
like that with us; 1 hope our easi- 
ness with one another will continue 
when the w ays of living grow more 
intricate, as 1 suppose they must. 

Frankie was illuminated with 
satisfaction too that first day in the 
town that was probably not 
Aberedo, when it was decided that 



certain w all-hooks in the Old-Time 
kitchen should be sacred to the 
priceless tools, and that Frankie 
himself should keep watch of this, 
empowered to raise hell with any- 
one who failed to replace them after 
use — and cleaned too. Angus laid 
his hands on Frankie’s shoulders, 
and though he may have intended a 
jest, when he spoke it was in solemn 
earnest: “From this day forth thou 
art Toolwarden.’’ 

AND THAT IS about the way we 
have used the old second 
person singular ever since — for 
emphasis, or special events of 
solemnity like this one, or those 
astounding occasions when two or 
three people (possibly even more 
though / have never known it to 
happen) not under the urgings of 
desire or self-importance, are able 
to share and enter one another's 
lives however briefly, doing so 
lovingly and unafraid. It may 
happen without speech, but not 
with much depth, for words — the 
right words, seldom heard — are 
like no other sort o f embrace. That 
is why the Professor troubles me, 
though / love him dearly; but on 
the island Peranelios (which vvc 
have so named because the 
invention comes from the stories of 
Demetrios) we never invade the 
privacy o f another with suggestions 
o f how he ought to be doing things 
this way or that way in the char- 
acter of somebody else. Yes, your 
novelist ran on several steps ahead.

a bratty thing to do. 1 am sorry. I 
only started out to say that Tool- 
warden is no small status, and no- 
body could have filled the position 
more excellently over the years than 
Frankie — who has yet to write his 
first book: just wait a while. 

T he boat Garth set himself to 
build could only be a dignified 
raft with a sail, a keel, a rudder- 
sweep, a cabin. Our tools and 
knowledge offered no way to warp 
and form the long grand curves of a 
true ship. It doesn’t matter — we 
knew from the first trials that she 
would serve. Bosco said she 
wouldn’t float. We launched her, 
very incomplete, hardly more than 
a framework platform, to work out 
a few problems with the steering 
and the keel, and several times 
more before Garth was satisfied 
with the setting of the mast, and 
she fioated nicely, but Bosco wasn't 
convinced. She wouldn’t carry the 
weight of the cabin, he said, not 
with all those people. 

Bosco’s real trouble lay deeper. 
He just didn’t want to gosemplace, 
not with us anyway. Angus finally 
took care of it, after the rest of the 
Company, including Bosco, had 
w asted considerable time and effort 
stew ing about it — you know, chew- 
ing the mahooha in corners with 
each other, uptight about hurt feel- 
ings, ballywambling around. Angus 
just sat down by Bosco one eve- 
ning — it was still warm enough so 
that we were eating some of our 



meals out in the garden — and said: 
“You don’t really want to go west 
w ith us, do you, Bosco?’’ 

“To be real fucking honest with 
you.” says Bosco, “it’s a fact I 
don’t. But I wouldn’t want to let 
you down.’’ 

“Sooner say goodbye than take 
you where you don’t want to go,’’ 
said Angus, and he added in his 
gentle no-nonsense w^ay just as if he 
meant it: “We’ll miss you 

naturally.’’ 

Maybe he did mean it. Maybe it 
takes a Ristacrat to lay on just 
enough butter, never too much, so 
you’re never sure it’s butter at all. 
He never buttered up Demetrios of 
course, because he loved him, nor 
me because he knew I’d have been 
aware of it. He may have laid it on 
slightly now and then with quick- 
tempered Nod, to simmer him 
down, and with Garth (slower of 
wit but thin-skinned) for no reason 
except that he loved to make Garth 
feel good — name me a better rea- 
son and you can have it. 

“Since you put it thataway,’’ said 
Bosco, “and with no hard feelings, 

I believe 1 better split. See, it’s this 
thing about Gammo’s Ramblers. 
If they went west a ways from that 
(own T.S. spoke of, they 
wouldn’t’ve gone far west. Ocean 
and wilderness don’t draw no 
Ramblers, account thev want to 
llnd a crowd in between ramblings, 
sell a few things, have some fun. 
And anyway it’s kind of on me to 
find Boss Gammo. I don’t care so

much about he might’ve been my 
Pa, but the thing of it is I owe him a 
licking. Even if he’s past seventy- 
something when 1 catch up with 
him he’ll still be meaner’n a cat- 
turd, and I’ll have to give him — 
well, a little one. Not, of course, if 
he can’t stand up.” 

So early next morning Bosco 
made his farewells, with small gifts 
IVom everyone, and the bow Garth 
had made for him, and new deer- 
hide sandals cut and thonged by 
Nod’s hands, and so forth — we all 
chipped in. While the rest were 
occupied with good wishes and 
llapdoodle I whispered to Frankie 
to go look at the tools, which he 
•did. and came back to say every- 
thing was in place, what was the 
matter? — in fact he was annoyed 
with me, for all he loved me so 
much and still does. {Oh, now it's 
out.) “What was you thinking of, 
Wynken?” says my Frankie, my 
Brains of the Outfit. {But not 
through your cleverness: through 
mine, mine.) “Aye-w'ell,” I told 
him, ”1 was just wondering.” 

Not until evening, when Bosco 
was long gone into the wilderness 
on his way back to his own kind of 
life, did Angus miss his wrist- 
^\ atch. 

MUST HAVE left it on the Billy- 
X Pock when 1 went swimming 
yesterday,” said Angus, knowing 
himself he was never that careless. 
For we had a little beach, sand- 
drifted for us by that lazy-seeming 



ocean, and Angus still liked to run 
in for a dip after the air had grown 
too sharp for the rest of us. Near 
the margin of the beach a statue of 
some gentleman named William 
Penn had fallen over or been 
pushed: it was earthquake country. 

I he old boy now lies gazing at the 
sky in benignant perplexity. 

1 went with Angus to help him 
look. He ran his hand over the 
pedestal, I poked around here and 
there; when we gave it up he sat 
down and laughed. “Oh, that 
damned roly-poly bastard!” he 
said, and laughed some more, but 
he was doing it to hide the fact that 
he was crying — Angus weeps rather 
easily: 1 believe it’s better than 
leaving frustrated unhappiness to 
I'ester — and 1 knew it was because 
Demetrios that afternoon had let 
slip an unintentional word during 
an attack of his sickness. It meant, 
or at least Angus took it to mean, 
that Demetrios didn’t think he’d 
live to sail with us when the boat 
was ready. 

"He’s had a life,” 1 said, "in two 
worlds, and there's been pleasure 
ill it.” 

"You do see into me.” (Well, 
human nature is my country — I 
have to look where I’m going.) 
Then Angus struck his knee in 
misery. "Two worlds — why not 
three? Why can’t he live to glimpse 
the third world he wants for us, the 
republic? It’s his dream, the rest of 
us are only groping after his mean- 
ing— except maybe you.”

“Are you looking for justice in 
nature?” 

“I suppose 1 was,” he said, and 
his weeping ceased. “He said, you 
know — it was when the pain had let 
us, but he was exhausted, near 
sleep 1 think, maybe didn’t know I 
was still sitting by him — he 
muttered something about the 
Moses principle.” 

“Maybe he only meant that all 
prophets are like Moses, because 
the promised land always stays 
somewhere just ahead.” He didn’t 
answer me, but took my hand and 
held it against his throat, a way he 
had. so that 1 felt his good blood 
beating there. “The promised land, 
w hen we get to ours, will have a few 
headaches.” 

“Don’t 1 kno\\', love? But he 
u oil Id enjoy dealing with them. He 
would like to see — ah. I’m going in 
for a dip.” He jumped up and 
shrugged off his clothes. “Come 
with me?” 

It was too cold, but I did any- 
way — because he’s such a dear 
hunk of boy, 1 suppose, with his 
red-brow n hair and his build like a 
Raphael angel, and 1 didn’t want to 
leave him. We plunged, and swam 
a while, and dried in the breeze, 
and made love. Only in the ways 
Angus allowed us, because he was 
afraid for me. 

It’s true enough a midget would 
be taking a chance, with no sur- 
geon around to do a Caesarean. Yet 
I had an easy delivery with Nod’s 
baby— it was sickness that took 



her — and I was facing almost the 
same risk in that pregnancy, for 
w e’re told midgets don’t breed true. 
But Nod and 1 are not proportion- 
ately short-legged and big-headed: 
couldn’t we be something a little bit 
new ? 1 wish it were so — and didn’t 
Demetrios himself, on a later after- 
noon during one of his remissions, 
say that he wished the Republic 
might have many people like Nod 
and me? And didn’t we at once fall 
to designing houses in our heads 
w licrc big and little could live to- 
gether and both be comfortable? 

She was a very tiny thing, my 
baby who lived three months, all in 
such perfect proportion — 

1 had milk for her. in plenty. 
Diphtheria killed her — one of the 
diseases conquered in the old time 
that will not come again. 

Nod’s wildness is beautiful and 
strikes a spark in me, but 1 am par- 
tial to gentleness too. Angus is 
sweet. Kve who had been Solitaire 
smiled on us without malice out of 
her young maternity when we went 
back to the house, quieter and 
comforted. 

T hrough the early winter we 
toiled at our vessel under 
Garth’s direction. Winter comes to 
southern Penn, if that is w'here we 
w ere. only as a chilling of the air for 
a lew months, with seldom a killing 
frost such as we expected in Lowell- 
town for December and January. 
Long rains fall, almost never snow. 
Wc were puzzled, what to use for a

sail; Demetrios warned us the 
woolen blankets would be no good, 
holding damp instead of shedding 
it. We thought of sending a party 
back along our trail to the last town 
we had passed, to buy linen cloth; 
but it had been a mean, small 
place, likely with nothing to offer, 
and Angus was not minded to 
divide the Company. 

Angus himself would not leave 
Demetrios. He had promised a cer- 
tain service to his friend that no one 
else could or should perform. He 
trusted me with the knowledge of 
it; since he has given me leave to 
write it, the others will learn (per- 
haps without much surprise) when 
they read what 1 have set down 
here, so much later. 

As for the sail, we patched our 
garments together, and cut up the 
blankets for such small rags of 
clothing as we might want from 
time to time. The cabin of the boat 
was sound enough to hold in our 
warmth and give us shelter; we 
would probably be sailing into a 
region of tropieal warmth. We all 
like nakedness, and w^e here young. 

The Professor — (young? well, 
yes, really, in all that matters) — 
spent most of his time with our 
friend, studying his face while the 
lute made music for him, knowing 
(often without a word from Deme- 
tiios) what mood of music the sick 
man’s mind might prefer to follow. 
He would shift suddenly from joy to 
sorrow, or the other way, or from 
simplicity into a counterpoint so 



subtle that Demetrios would frown 
with delight in going along with 
it — all this in response to some 
message from Demetrios that we 
had missed. And whatever the shift 
of mood, Demetrios would nod 
with satisfaction, and share the 
journey until the pain struck again 
destroying the chance of pleasure. 

I have not heart nor wish to write 
of Demetrios’ sufferings nor of the 
thousand indignities that attend a 
long dying, except to say: he 

endured them, until the time came 
when he could tell his beloved that 
he wished to endure them no more. 
He did speak once, placidly but 
with some contempt, of the Old- 
Time habits of pawky euphemism, 
of wrapping its human stuff in a 
bundle of comfort against the facts 
of death and suffering and finality. 
And once, when Garth and Frankie 
and the Professor and 1 were with 
him, he said: “1 have nothing intri- 
cate to tell you about death. Death 
is necessary, like birth; dying is un- 
pleasant, also unimportant. Except 
for such truisms, such small ob- 
vious bits of comment — why, 
there’s just nothing worth saying 
about it: it is life that speaks. Play 
us a little Mozart, Professor — he 
was a good cheerful joe w'ho knew 
how to cry.” 

There came a warm day of 
March when by unspoken agree- 
ment we left Angus alone with him, 
and lingered outside the house, 
sometimes looking at our finished 
boat where she tugged at the

anchor bespoken by an easterly 
breeze. 

You may be wondering certain 
things. I am writing in the year 
when Demetrios' dark- haired 
daughter. Eve’s daughter, is seven 
years old. My sister's girl was bom 
two days later: she is fair and 
bouncing, and small like Nod and 
me. 

As I hinted some long time ago, / 
returned for a visit to the eastern 
nations. I traveled in safety, with 
Garth and a much bigger Frankie. 
We had a few days in Nuber. Mam 
Estelle was dead. Babette came 
hack with us, with the Diary, 
Shawn's pictures, a few other bits 
of valued loot. It was good to re- 
turn; it is good to discover the end 
o f this hook, and turn my though ts 
to other affairs. It will be evening 
presently, and Eve's daughter 
Miranda will go to chasing fire flies. 

Out there watching the inland 
sea, we felt no need of saying good- 
bye, for each time we had been with 
Demetrios lately it had been a 
goodbye: he knew it. In an hour, or 
two, Angus came out of the house 
and sat on the ground, and when 
F've went to him he lifted a, handful 
of earth and let it flow through his 
fingers. 

Afterward he told me how Deme- 
trios had asked after each of us in 
turn, whether we were of good 
heart and right with ourselves. 
“And then he told me,” said 



Angus, “that pain had won, over 
the enjoyment of living, and so it 
was time for what we had agreed 
on. And he said — how could this 
be, Wynken? — he said that in our 
short time together he had known 
more delight of body and mind 
than he supposed most men ever 
crowd into a lifetime. Can such a 
thing be true, Wynken?” he asked 
me. as if I knew. I don’t know in 
how many senses it can be true. But 
1 think, and 1 told Angus, that it 
was certainly the aspect of truth 
that Demetrios w as accepting. 

Then Angus had kissed his 
Friend, and placed a cushion over 
his face and held him fast until it 
was over, because this was the 
manner of death that Demetrios 
had requested, saying there would 
be no distress in it under Angus’ 
hands, and w'ishing that Angus 
might later be free to tell us the 
w hole truth of it or not, as he saw 
fit. 

We had thought to give him a sea 
burial. But Garth’s good boat 
carried us more swiftly than we ex- 
pected to that island we had watch- 
ed from the mainland. It was lonely 
and small, a patch of innocent 
wilderness. Not a place for the re- 
public, but we could pause there, 
before sailing on to find the island 
we would name Peranelios, where 
this part of the story ends. And it 
suited our hearts to bury Deme- 
trios’ body there, near a wild grape 
that would accept it and bear fruit 
each season in the sun, ★

THE TWIST 




TIM ALTOM 



Where the checkerboard 
goes on and on .. 



Life in the Twist ain’t hard. I 
mean, there’s lots of other Twists, 
but somehow, when you’ve lived 
someplace for a long time, years 
maybe, you get to call it “the” 
when you talk about it. I been here 
since ’01, year of the riots. I didn’t 
get involved in no riots, though. 
That ain’t my style. It’s kinda 
funny, but 1 got caught and put in 
the Twist after I gave the scientists 
and politicians the way to make it. 
Pete, see . Pete’s a scientist 
frienda mine ... he wanted a 
gizmo called a dimensular unit for 
some invention. He hired me to 
steal it, ’cause the guys who owned 
it wouldn’t sell him one. It figures 
they wouldn’t. They’re scientists, 
like Pete, but lots more chicken- 
shit. 

Pete was a guy who experimented 
a lot with electricity. He was a real 
nut, used to cut holes in his apart- 
ment walls to put boxes of stuff in 
when he ran out of room on the 
floor. One time a guy sneaked in 
and stole some of the stuff. Pete 
damn near had an attack. I never 
saw a guy more interested in 
making money, either. He told me 



he could make a million bucks with 
his new invention. He said it would 
move things around by dissolving 
’em and shooting ’em someplace 
else; kind of like radio, though not 
quite. I took a year of math in high 
school but it didn’t help much 
when he started getting real deep in 
the stuff, trying to explain it. Pete 
once told me he was kicked outta 
science on account of he blew up 
somebody’s lab trying to find per- 
petual motion. Said he could do 
about anything he wanted, if he 
had the stuff to do it with. He told 
me too that the thing he wanted for 
his invention would have to be 
lifted from the inside and that all 
the labs in the country knew him 
and wouldn’t hire him to strip 
wires. So he needed me to lift the 
dimensular unit for him, and we’d 
split the millions, fifty-fifty. 

Really, 1 don’t have no regrets 
about it anymore. I mean, 1 used to 
steal things for a living. I used to 
have junk taken by teachers clear 
back in grade school. They’d lock it 
up in closets and I’d have it inside 
of an hour. It shouldn’t’a been any 
hassle and it wouldn’t’a been if I 



167 




hadn’t been so dumb. It wasn’t 
Pete’s fault I got caught. He filled 
his side all right. He got me the job 
and all. No, I fouled it up. 

F irst day at work. I had my 
little badge, my company-issue 
uniform, my smile, and I was ready 
for work. I always had a hard time, 
first days at work. That’s why I 
never worked legal for very long. I 
never could get used to any kind of 
janitor work, which was about all I 
could do that wasn’t making license 
plates or picking locks. Dimen- 
sions, Incorporated hired me to be 
a Third-Class Sanitation Engineer. 
That means janitor. I just swept 
floors and mopped ’em at night. 
And only the hall floors at that. 
They wouldn’t even let me change a 
light bulb in a lab or an office when 
1 first started. They kept everything 
important locked up most’a the 
time. But 1 was happy doing hall 
floors. Office floors always made 
me nervous, they took me back to 
state. 

The State Penatentiary. I put in 
twelve years there. Twelve long, 
stinking years with nothing to show 
for it except I got grey hair. I stayed 
in a cell with three other guys, a cell 
about as big as one of them busi- 
ness offices. I hear that business- 
men sometimes complain about the 
size of their offices. I wonder how 
they’d feel if they had to share it 
with four bunks, three guys, and a 
toilet. 1 was only supposed to do 



seven years but I busted out and got 
caught. That added five years, no 
parole. 1 almost busted out again, 
but somebody told the screws and 
they had me put in solitary. There 
ain’t no escape from there. My soli- 
tary cell was even smaller than my 
regular one. It leaked cold air in 
the winter and made you sweat off 
five pounds every day in the 
summer. And it stank. Oh, Lord, 
did it stink. Anyway, that’s why I 
don’t like offices. When I’m in one 
long enough the chairs and desks 
and things start to disappear and 
the walls melt into bars. 1 start 
hearing the screws yelling down the 
line and smell the piss and sweat. 
Pretty soon I’m crawling on the 
walls, sweating and cussing, and 
trying to find the doorknob. When 
1 do I’ll yank the door open and fall 
outside, screaming and running. At 
least when I’m in the halls that 
don’t happen. 

Yo(| might think a big company 
might not want cons on their pay- 
rolls, which is what I thought. But 
then I found out that Dimensions 
likes to have cons work for them, 
doing janitor work and such. They 
say it gives a fellow human-being a 
new lease on life; like it allows a guy 
to remake himself. But every con in 
there knows sure as people make’ 
prisons that the real reason is to 
make the scientists feel good. 
Scientists are all a little off, and a 
lot of ’em feel like they passed up a 
lot’ a life by going to school so long 
and then having to stay in labs all 



168 



GALAXY 




their lives. So Dimensions hires 
cons to scrub floors and pull gum 
off a chairs. Scientists leave gum on 
chairs, too. 

1 used to think of us cons as the 
guys taking care of a machine. The 
machine really didn’t do much of 
anything useful, but it had to be 
taken care of. We oiled it and 
polished it and replaced its cogs 
and gears when they got loose or 
busted. We scrubbed the rust off 
and cleaned out the dust. We kept 
the people machine running 
smooth. 

I’ve seen what bad upkeep can 
do to a machine. Once, in the pen, 
we had a machine blow up ’cause it 
wasn’t taken care of right. I mean it 
really blew up, killed the guy work- 
ing it. It curled smoke for awhile 
but nobody noticed or cared. Then 
funny noises came out of it, like 
dozens of ball bearings were 
suddenly loose inside and shooting 
around from part to part and 
making one hell of a racket. Then a 
huge crack spread down the front 
and the machine’s guts came out. 
The guy working the controls 
screamed a couple’a times, but you 
couldn’t see him for the flying 
metal shavings and bits of springs 
and wires. After it was all over, and 
we used fire extinguishers on the 
little electrical fires, we couldn’t 
even find anything that we could be 
sure was really him. He was all 
burned and cut and mixed in pretty 
well with all the metal parts that 
used to belong to the machine. It 



was funny, I think. He must’a 
thought he had that machine right 
where he wanted it. And it blew up 
on him, grinding him up and 
spitting him out. 

Pete said all I had to do was work 
at Dimensions for awhile, until they 
let me into the labs. That’s where 
they kept their important parts to 
the inventions, because the labs are 
the cleanest rooms in the building. 
During the day nobody was allowed 
in except the technicians. At night, 
though, they had to let somebody 
in to clean up what the automatics 
can’t. Stuff up the size of a gnat’s 
ass could be sucked oufa the air, 
but bigger stuff had to be cleaned 
up by Sanitation Engineers. The 
guards might’a done it, but their 
agreement with the company 
wouldn’t let ’em. Pete gave me a 
little meter that he said would find 
radioactivity. He showed me how to 
set it, where the needle would go 
when the meter found the unit, and 
how to hide it so the guard wouldn’t 
find it. I had a rolling cart Dimen- 
sions gave me to work with. It had 
an old floor wax can on the end that 
had soap powder in it. Pete said I 
could hide the meter in the soap 
and the metal detector wouldn’t 
know it was there. I’d do the same 
with the unit when I found it, after 
wrapping it up in lead foil so I 
could get in past the radiation de- 
tector outside the door. We went 
over the heist until I said we 
couldn’t foul up, no way. 

1 had the late shift, starting at 



THE TWIST 



169 




eight o’clock. I rolled my cart down 
the hall, passing the two-colored 
squares on the floor. They were 
black and white and looked like a 
big checkerboard. They reminded 
me of my cell, too, except that floor 
was black-and-white because the 
cement floor was chipped in some 
places and dirty in others. 

The guard on duty was a friend’a 
mind, sort’a. He liked me so I knew 
he wouldn’t work too hard check- 
ing me over. I rolled the cart into 
the little room in front where you’re 
cleaned of dust by a hard blast of 
raw air. Burt, the guard, nosed 
around the cart while me and the 
cart were being scrubbed. He 
looked into the soap bin, but didn’t 
stop. He lifted a couple’a things, 
sniffed, and said to go ahead. The 
far door slid open, I pushed my cart 
through, and I was in the lab. 

I thought it’d be dark in there, 
but it wasn’t. Maybe they kept it lit 
up for insurance. I could see Burt’s 
head through the emergency door, 
beside the other door connecting 
onto the cleaning tunnel. He was 
sitting down, reading a book. The 
trouble with that was he could see 
in just by turning his head. I 
couldn’t hang nothing over the 
door or he’d get suspicious. 
Suddenly he turned and waved. I 
waved back and started getting 
cleaning stuff off a the cart. I 
shoved the meter under my shirt, 
along with my lock-picking tools. I 
picked up the dry mop and walked 
over to a wall. I sized the place up 



real quick and all of a sudden 
realized how long it’d take me to 
pull the job, I'hat lab looked like 
the operating rooms you see on 
doctor shows, but a whole lot 
bigger. All (he walls were either 
chrome or glass-like plastic. The 
only way to tell what was a cabinet 
and what wasn’t was by looking at 
the little hairline cracks running 
down the walls and by the little 
holes where keys would go. There 
were long benches strung all over 
the room with meters and irons and 
things attached to’em. Except for 
papers dropped on the floor, the 
lab was spotless. There wasn’t one 
spot of over-heavy wax on the floor. 
No fly specks on the ceiling. No 
burn marks on the benches. You 
see it? Like the room was created to 
study what clean really was. 

1 walked along the walls with my 
mop, holding the little meter just 
out in front. I must’a gone around 
that room five times before that 
sweet little needle jumped over to 
the right place. If I’d’a had to go 
around the place once more I’d 
probably’a quit. I was shaking real 
bad, throwing looks every other 
second at Burt. I looked up again 
when the needle jumped. Burt 
looked like he was asleep. I pulled 
out my tools and got to my real 
work. 

O NCE I was called up from the 
pen to testify before some com- 
mittee that was studying prisoners 
and prisons. As far as 1 know, they 



170 



GALAXY 




wrote down everything I said and 
never looked at it again, because I 
never heard of nothing being done 
with it. I sat at a table in front of 
them, wearing a suit. It was the 
only time I wore a suit the whole 
twelve years I was in the can. 
The committee sat a little above 
me, on a platform. They asked me 
questions and I answered them. 
Sometimes one guy looked happy at 
an answer, and other times another 
guy would. Sometimes the screws 
that brought me looked like they’d 
eaten yellow snow by mistake at 
some’a the things I said. I told’em 
too, by God . told’em about the 
noise, and the smells, and about 
the four bunks and me and three 
guys and a toilet. I told’em about 
solitary and the chipped floor 
and — I told’em every lousy thing I 
could remember, that’s all. And 
somebody wrote it all down. It 
didn’t make things easy for me 
when I got back to the pen. Some of 
the screws who’d been my friends 
weren’t interested in me anymore. 
But 1 really didn’t care. 1 was due 
for release in two weeks. Funny, 
ain’t it? 1 mean, people all the time 
yell real loud about reforming 
prisons but all they ever do is make 
stronger ones. What those politi- 
cians wanted w'as a prison that was 
good for speeches but was so strong 
you couldn’t get out of. 

I ’ll probably never know why 
they locked that little box up in 
that stupid closet. Here was a 



gadget worth maybe two million 
dollars or something and they trust 
it to a lock a retarded monkey 
could ’a picked. I guess, except for 
when they’re doing science, scien- 
tists are stupid all the way around. 
The unit and meter fit real nice into 
the soap can along with my tools. I 
dusted a little more and picked up 
paper so Burt wouldn’t think some- 
thing was a little strange. Then I 
signalled him to let me out. He got 
up and yaw ned and 1 took one last 
look around that room. All that 
stainless steel and chrome. Plastic, 
glass, and aluminum. It was all so 
nice and shiny clean it almost made 
me cry. 1 thought about how I’d 
wanted to get in there so bad . 
worked for it, months on end. If I’d 
stayed I’d probably have given in to 
temptation and sneaked in a 
sledgehammer. The other guys who 
had worked the labs talked some- 
times about what they’d bust first if 
they had a sledgehammer in there. 

1 knew what I’d have gone for first. 
There w as a big light in the middle 
of the room, about twenty feet long, 
and all covered with a wire cage for 
protection. I’d take a sledge and I’d 
smash that big cage, smash it and 
twist it and break it apart. I got so 
worked up about it I might have 
done it right then if Burt hadn’t 
opened the lock on the door for me 
to get out. I pushed the cart 
through the door, all through the 
cleaning tunnel, and out the other 
door. Burt stopped me again and 
searched a little bit with the metal 



THE TWIST

detector and the radiation counter. 
He nodded me on. I was home free. 

I was down the hall and around a 
bend before I let myself laugh. I 
laughed at Burt and the scientists 
and Dimensions all at once. I 
shouldn’t have done it, but I pulled 
the little dimensular unit out of the 
soap bin and looked at it. It had 
little dials and switches and jack 
plugs on its face, a square mirror 
about as big as a dollar bill. I 
walked off down the hall, leaving 
my cart where it was, and tossing 
the little box into the air. It was my 
revenge on the scientists, on the 
screws, and the fat government 
guys. With it I was bigger than 
Pete, even. I could sell it to any- 
body 1 wanted. But no. That wasn’t 
right. Pete got me the job so I could 
get the box. He ought to have some- 
thing. 

That’s when I tossed it up once 
too often and a little too far away. 
It hit the wall, bounced to the tile, 
and rolled off down the hall. And it 
hummed. Lord, it hummed loud as 
a bee hive, I ran after it, picking it 
up without slowing down. I looked 
for something that might shut it 
off, but I didn’t have time to look 
for one thing in all them controls. I 
tucked it under my arm and ran, 
hums and all, to the double-doors 
leading to the offices. They crashed 
open when I hit them, and glass 
spilled over the floor in strange 
flashing colors. My hand was cut 
pretty bad from one of the busted 
pieces but I couldn’t stop. I kept on 



running, pounding in my rubber- 
soled shoes. Guards looked kind of 
funny at me, but I was holding my 
arms across my stomach like I was 
about to puke. I ran past doors 
with blurry numbers and office 
fronts. I went past bulletin boards 
and light bulb after light bulb. I 
finally got to the front doors, the 
ones leading to the street. They 
opened in but I made them open 
out. I couldn’t wait to get out, into 
the cool air where 1 could run on 
wet cement and run and run . 

. and I was still running on 
tile, with overhead lighting and 
double doors in front of me. Wrong 
turn, I thpught, and opened them. 
Ran on through. Ran by labs and 
offices and more labs. On checker- 
board tile under light bulbs with 
cages around them. I was starting 
to get tired, my breath getting 
sharp. 1 ran past business rooms 
and labs and more rooms and more 
labs and offices and typewriters 
and telephones and little offices 
and labs with guards and cages 
around the lights and then I ran 
past Burt. 

I saw Burt get up but I didn’t 
care. I had to keep going, before 
the alarm went off and other 
guards’d come down on me. Burt 
started after me, looking puzzled. 
Sweat ran into my eyes and I 
smacked into something hard with 
sharp corners that gouged my ribs. 

My cart. 

I slowed down, walked. I came 
up on two double doors. Their glass 



172 



GALAXY 




was sprinkled over the floor. I 
looked at my hand and saw the red 
blood still flowing that had already 
stained half my shirt red. I looked 
at Burt coming up behind me. I 
took off, running blind, looking for 
the outside wall like in one of them 
mazes guys build for rats. Burt 
caught up with me and grabbed my 
arms, but I shook him off. Now 
there were five or six other guards 
chasing me. Through the doorway, 
past more labs and offices, with the 
theft alarm screaming around me. 
The loudspeakers were yelling 
orders and questions one after the 
other. I didn’t see the glass doors to 
the street the second time, and now 
I know it was the second time. I 
almost knocked myself out on the 
door handle. In the few seconds, be- 
fore the guards reached me, 1 saw 
outside the doors that were sup- 
posed to lead out. They didn’t. 1 
should have been looking out at 
stars and wet pavement. I was look- 
ing at the same landscape I’d 
passed minutes before. There were 
little red drops leading away down 
a corridor that shouldn’t have 
existed and didn’t end. For the first 
time in my life, I was really scared. 
Not just of getting caught, but of 
what I could see, something other 
than the eorridor or Burt. It wasn’t 
nothing I could point at, but star- 
ing down that hall, the one I’d al- 
ready run down, I knew I’d never 
forget that feeling of being frus- 
trated and scared — of trapped 
places you couldn’t never get out 



of. Then the guards mobbed me. 

rr^HEY found me guilty and sent 
me back to jail. Life sure is 
fiinny, ya know? 1 mean, if it 
wasn’t for me stealing that dimen- 
sular and dropping it so the little 
jigger inside touched another little 
jigger they wouldn’t’a discovered 
the Dimensulation Effect. From 
what they told me, the Twist is 
something like a thing they call the 
mobius strip. Someway, when you 
take a strip of paper and put it to- 
gether like a tread on a tank, and 
give it one twist before you put it to- 
gether, you get a thing called a 
mobius strip that makes you end up 
right where you started by walking 
in any direction. Dimensions, In- 
corporated builds Twists because 
they jumped on their rights on the 
dimensular unit. The Twist is really 
just a little different from the effect 
I got caught in inside Dimensions. 
What happened, sort of, was that 
the tail of the building connected 
with the front so I couldn’t get out 
no matter where I went. In the 
Twist, you can walk down the one 
hallway and walk right around to 
where you started. So God help me, 
for the rest of my life I’ll be running 
down that same hallway past labs 
and offices and Burt. 

Pretty soon they put other guys in 
with me, and now there’s seven of 
us. We get fed from a little machine 
set in the wall. It gives us the food 
on plates made of some kind of 
milk-colored plastic that dissolves 



THE TWIST 



173 




after twenty minutes or so. Little 
holes in the walls suck out anything 
dirty, like the toilet in my old cell. 
It’s a lot better than the one in the 
lab, even. Spraying nozzles blast 
the floor to clean up old food or 
where somebody’s pissed. It’s easy 
to look out the windows but there’s 
not much to see. Just another hall- 
way on the other side, same as the 
one we’re in. You can climb 
through the windows on either side, 
and be in another hallway like the 
one you came out of. They have 
doors up along the hall because 
they’re afraid we’ll go crackers see- 
ing a hallway that never ends. So 
they gave us doors that can’t be 
propped back. You can lock the 
doors at both sides of a little room 
you can call your own, but guards 
have keys and anyway, all you have 
to do is crawl through a window to 
land in somebody’s bedroom. We 
can’t bust into the walls to get at 
the machinery, because the walls 
are made of some real tough 
plastic. We can’t jump the guards 
because whenever they bring some- 
body in they always wait until we’re 
asleep. I been in here almost a year, 
longer than anybody. I used to keep 
a calendar of scratch marks on the 
wall but the blasting hoses shot’em 
all off. 

The walls are smooth, like egg- 
shells. That’s what the whole Twist 
reminds me of — an egg. Except 
we’ll never hatch out of it. It’s an 
egg of piss and sweat and death. 
Nobody in my Twist is a first-timer; 



the only people put in here are the 
ones that’ve got life sentences. No- 
body else in my Twist knows that I 
made it possible to build one. 
They’d probably laugh at me if they 
knew. I only been in here a little 
over a year, and the only thing that 
keeps me from going nuts is the 
room. But that’s not enough any- 
more. I’m starting to get faint 
whiffs of three other guys and a 
toilet. 1 don’t know just what I’m 
going to do when I start climbing 
walls. Maybe hold my breath until I 
turn blue and die. 

This place is perfect, I guess. 
The people outside don’t have to 
look at us or pay attention to us. 
We can’t get out. Ever. Sometimes 
it makes me sore that I did it, gave 
them the Twist. They probably 
never would’a found the Effect 
without me. I gave them politicians 
what they really wanted and now 
they’ve got a prison that’s escape- 
proof and humane at the same 
time. 

It’s funny, but we haven’t had 
anybody put in here in a long time. 
Whenever we used to yell out, we 
usually got somebody to yell back. 
They don’t yell anymore. I think 
maybe the people machine blew up, 
some way, and we were just for- 
gotten. Maybe somebody forgot the 
oil, or broke a part. I don’t suppose 
whatever happened’ll affect us any, 
though. And so help me they’ve got 
tile floors in here. They’re check- 
ered, in fact. 

Black and White. Funny. ♦
