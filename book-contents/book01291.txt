THAT 

THERE 

OPPOSITION 


A conversation-jockey on a night- 
time Philadelphia radio show 
said (we can’t quote exactly) that 
though he used to be a science-fic- 
tion reader, he no longer bothers 
with it, because all the things which 
used to excite his imagination have 
become today’s fact. Notice that 
“all”. 

Mr. Russell Kirk, in his good col- 
lection of spooky tales called The 
Surly Sullen Bell, includes a disser- 
tation on the Gothick tale, in which 
he «ays (and we quote) : “ . 
stories of the supernatural have been 
supplanted by ‘science fiction’. 
Though the talent of H. G. Wells 
did in that genre nearly everything 
worth undertaking, a flood of ‘sci- 


entific’ and ‘futuristic’ fantasies con- 
tinues to deluge America. With few 
exceptions, these writings are banal 
and meaningless . Having demol- 
ished, to their own satisfaction, the 
whole edifice of religious learning, 
abruptly and unconsciously they ex- 
perience the need for belief in some- 
thing not mundane; and so, defying 
their own inductive and mechanistic 
premises, they take up the cause of 
Martians and Jovians.” 

Time Magazine, which we will 
not quote, deposes and says that sf is 
suffering from a played-out vein of 
literary ore, and that it will have to 
rest until the average man on the 
street becomes a little more familiar 
with science’s more remote and sub-

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

tie discoveries, which, Time opines, 
are not able to support good story 
telling. 

Alfie Bester gives us, in F&SF, an- 
other and apparently final bleat in 
his oft-heard, captain-hates-the-sea 
speech; sf doesn’t live up to its re- 
sponsibilities and he wants no part 
of it. 

These are some, but not all, of the 
facets of opposition to sf. To us, the 
Philly night-jar was simply saying 
that he does not read enough sf to 
know what he’s talking about; Time t 
which never seems to have under- 
stood the field, reveals at last that it 
thinks science fiction is and should 
be about known science, thereby 
eliminating all the speculation which 
is really what sf is for, and as for 
Alfie . well, may he find in some 
preferred field the inspiration which 
gave us The Demolished Man, and 
a fraction of the awe and honor his 
unique quality gained him when he 
was with us. 

M r. Kirk, now, voices with some 
passion an opposition to what 
he thinks we believe in; it is diffi- 
cult, after a quarter of a century in 
the field, to know where he got this 
conviction. We have never been 
aware that sf writers, or readers, or 
indeed scientists, one and all worship 
godless materialism. It seems to us 


that sf has and does express all de- 
grees of religious devotion, right 
across the spectrum from Clarke’s 
The Star to Boucher’s Balaam. Can 
you accuse Heinlein of atheism? Or 
— well — Sturgeon? Bradbury is one 
of the most God-infused human be- 
ings we have ever met. 

We become increasingly aware of 
the nature of the opposition. To be 
fair, we should say a nature of etc. 
Have you ever observed the diffi- 
culty with which a genuine, intelli- 
gent, knowledgeable American patri- 
ot discusses and defines American 
democracy? In the articulate por- 
tions of the radical Right, no one 
seems to be able to produce a clear, 
simple declaration of aims and prin- 
ciples. Devoted members of the cler- ' 
gy traditionally spend months, and 
months of years, expatiating on the- 
ological points. 

The easy definitions come to the 
opposition. If you want a short 
snappy definition of American de- 
mocracy, ask a Communist. Any left- 
winger can dispose of all organized 
religion with the back of his hand. 
The entire television industry can be 
fluffled off by anyone who has nev- 
er owned a set. 

In other short sharp words, you 
can define and oppose anything if 
you’re ignorant enough, and if you’re 
ignorant enough, you do,

THE 

GREEN WORLD 

BY HAL CLEMENT 

ILLUSTRATED BY GIUNTA 

* 

The planet was an enigma — 
and its solution was death! 


i 

A zoo can be a rather de- 
pressing place, or it can be a 
lot of fun, or it can be so dull as to 
make the mind wander elsewhere in 
self-defence. In fairness to Emer- 
aude, Robin Lampert had to con- 
cede that this one was not quite in 
the last group. He had been able to 
keep his attention on the exhibits. 
This was, in a way, surprising; for 
while a frontier town has a perfect 
right to construct and maintain a 
zoo if it wishes, one can hardly ex- 
pect such a place to do a very good 
job. 


The present example was, it must 
be admitted, not too good. The ex- 
hibits were in fairly ordinary cages 
— barred for the larger creatures, 
glassed for the smaller ones. No 
particular attempt had been made 
to imitate natural surroundings. The 
place looked as artificial as bare 
concrete and iron could make it. To 
a person used to the luxuries pro- 
vided their captive animals by the 
great cities of Earth and her sister 
planets, the environment might have 
been a gloomy one. 

Lampert did not feel that way. 
He had no particular standards of 


THE GREEN WORLD 


7 


what a zoo should be, and he would 
probably have considered attempts 
at reproduction of natural habitat 
a distracting waste of time. He was 
not a biologist, and had only one 
reason for visiting the Emeraude 
zoo; the guide had insisted upon it. 

There was, of course, some jus- 
tice in the demand. A man who was 
taking on the responsibility of caring 
for Lampert and his friends in the 
jungles of Viridis had a right to re- 
quire that his charges know what 
they were facing. Lampert wanted 
to know, himself; so he had read 
conscientiously every placard on 
every cage he had been able to find. 
These had not been particularly in- 
formative, except in one or two 
cases. Most of the facts had been 
obvious from a look at the cages* 
inhabitants. Even a geophysicist 
could tell that the Felodon , for ex- 
ample, was carnivorous — after one 
of the creatures had bared a rather 
startling set of fangs by yawning in 
his face. The placard had told little 
more. Less, in fact, than McLaugh- 
lin had already said about the beasts. 

On the other hand, it had been 
distinctly informative to read that 
a small, salamanderlike thing in one 
of the glass-fronted cages was as 
poisonous as the most dangerous of 
Terrestrial snakes. There had been 
nothing in its appearance to betray 
the fact. It was at this point, in fact, 
that Lampert began really to awak- 
en to what he was doing. 

H e was aroused all the way 
by McLaughlin’s explanation 
of a number which appeared on a 
good many of the placards. Lamp- 

8 


ert had noticed it already. The num- 
ber was always, it seemed, differ- 
ent, though always in the same 
place, and bore signs of much re- 
painting. It bore no relationship to 
any classification scheme that Lamp- 
ert knew, and neither of the pale- 
ontologists could enlighten him. 
Eventually he turned to McLaugh- 
lin and asked — not expecting a use- 
ful answer, since the man was a 
guide rather than a naturalist. How- 
ever, the tall man gave a 'faint smile 
and replied without hesitation. 

“That’s just the number of human 
deaths known to have been caused 
by that animal this year.” It did not 
comfort Lampert too greatly to 
learn that the year used was that of 
Viridis, some seventeen times as 
long as that of Earth. For the 
Felodon the number stood at twelve. 
This was not very much when com- 
pared to the annual losses from ti- 
gers in India during the nineteenth 
century. But this reflection was not 
particularly consoling. The human 
population of Viridis was so very 
small compared to that of India. 

Lampert examined the creature 
thoughtfully. It was of moderate 
size as carnivores went — some four 
feet long without the tail — and 
looked rather harmless as long as it 
kept its mouth shut. It was lying in 
the center of the cage, so it was 
difficult to judge the length of its 
legs. It showed no trace of the tend- 
ency displayed by many captive 
animals, of lying against a wall or 
in a corner when relaxed; and there 
was none of the restless pacing so 
characteristic of Earth’s big cats 
under similar circumstances. It sim- 

IF 



ply lay and stared back at Lampert, 
so steadily that he never was sure 
whether or not the cold eyes were 
provided with lids. 

“I never liked reptiles back home, 
but I think I like these creatures 
less.” The voice of Mitsuitei, the 
little archaeologist, cut into Lamp- 
ert’s reverie. 

“Don’t let Hans or Ndomi hear 
you mention them in the same 
breath with reptiles,” he answered. 

“Well, I’m not fond of frogs, 
either.” 

“I’m afraid that wouldn’t make 
them much happier. These are not 
even amphibians.” 

“They certainly are. I’ve been 
told that they lay eggs in water and 
have a tadpole stage — ” 

“I should have said they aren’t 
Amphibians with a capital A. That 
is, they don’t belong to the order 
Amphibia, since they are not genet- 
ically related to the corresponding 
order on Earth, as far as we know. 
Sulewayo gets quite peeved at 
people who try to lump terrestrial 
and extraterrestrial creatures in the 
same order. I believe that whoever 
decides things for biologists has de- 
creed thaf on Viridis the dominant 
order is to be called Amphibids. It’s 
a quibble, if you like. But I can see 
why they insist on it.” 

“Mph. So can I. Even now you 
sometimes run into people who go 
to great length to make you admit 
that there are pyramids both in 
Egypt and Mexico — and for that 
matter on Regulus Six — and infer 
from that that their makers had 
something in the way of common 
culture. I say these things are amphi- 
THE GREEN WORLD 


bians, without the Capital A, be- 
cause they are at home both on 
land and in water. And a dictionary 
would back me up. I don’t insist 
that they’re related to those of 
Earth — any more than a Mayan 
pyramid has anything but geometry 
in common with an Egyptian one.” 
“But I’ve heard—” 

“I’m sure you have, but it’s a 
sore subject. I’ll be open-minded if 
you like and admit that some Egyp- 
tian may have been blown across 
the Atlantic and taught architecture 
to the Americans, but I don’t regard 
it as proved. What was that remark 
of yours — ‘as far as we know’ — 
in connection with the ancestry of 
the amphibids? That’s being at least 
as open-minded as I was, I would 
say.” 

4 4Xn a way, yes. I don’t think 
A anyone has seriously suggested 
that these things originated on 
Earth. However, a puzzle we’re here 
to investigate still exists. How there 
could be life forms corresponding 
to those which took a good half 
billion years to evolve elsewhere, on 
a planet which by geophysical evi- 
dence hasn’t been solid for forty 
million? Someone certainly has sug- 
gested that the world was stocked 
from outside. But certainly it hasn’t 
been proved. I don’t think anyone 
has tried very hard, either. And I 
certainly won’t, on a planet with as 
much radioactivity as this one. 

“You think that would account 
for high-speed evolution?” 

Lampert shrugged his shoulders, 
and began to stroll toward the next 
cage. “Ask the paleontologists. My 

9 



opinion doesn’t carry much weight.” 

Mitsuitei nodded, started to fol- 
low the geophysicist, and then 
turned back to stare once more at 
the carnivore lying a few feet away. 
It stared back unblinkingly. 

The visit to the zoo was one of 
several, which continued until Lamp- 
ert, Mitsuitei and the two paleon- 
tologists were able to identify each 
of a dozen animals which were most 
concerned in the death rate of Viri- 
dis. Apparently McLaughlin was not 
the only guide who did this. The 
zoo was equipped to give a “final 
examination” in which any creature 
the guide desired could be seen on 
a television screen from viewpoints 
quite different from those obtained 
in front of the cages. McLaughlin 
proved hard to satisfy. 

Lampert did not blame him. He 

10 


knew a lot about Viridis, of course. 
He had not only read of it in ordi- 
nary reference material, but had 
done much of the laboratory work 
on drill cores brought from the 
planet. His name had been one of 
those attached to the report giving 
the probable age of the planet’s 
crust. At that time, however, the 
mental picture he held had been of 
continent distribution, rock strata, 
zones of diastrophic stress and the 
like. The question of the appearance, 
or even the existence, of plants, 
animals and people had simply never 
risen to conscious level in his mind. 

That had changed, shortly before 
his arrival. The tramp spacer which 
had brought him and his group to 
Viridis had had to orbit about the 
world in free fall for several hours 
while its obsolete drive elements

really sure of those. For the rest, 
the planet was a vast, gray-black 
circle occulting a portion of the 
Milky Way. It was not absolutely 
black, either. Its contrast with the 
background of the galaxy was di- 
minished by the glow in the upper 
atmosphere arising from the re- 
combination of water molecules dis- 
sociated during the day by Beta 
Librae’s fierce ultraviolet light. The 
center of the circle was darker than 
the edges, where the line of sight 
penetrated through more of the 
luminous gas. 

But even this sight, unusual as it 
was, did not affect Lampert as much 
as the lack of city lights. He had 
done field work in lonely, wild 
places before, of course; but until 
now he had always had the feeling 
of being in an island of wilderness 


“cooled,” and the passengers had 
examine the planet. 

Lampert, oddly enough, had been 
as much impressed by the night side 
as by the sunlit hemisphere. The 
latter had shown, ,at twenty thou- 
sand kilometers, a fairly standard 
land and water pattern. The most 
unusual thing about it had been the 
almost perfect uniformity of the 
land coloration, a light green which 
bespoke, or at least implied, a vir- 
tually complete covering of vegeta- 
tion. 

By the time the ship had circled 
to the dark side, however, it was 
much closer to the surface; and 
Lampert would have expected to 
make out luminous sparks and 
patches of towns and cities by the 
hundreds. 

He saw just two, and was not 
THE GREEN WORLD 



more or less surrounded by civiliza- 
tion. On Viridis it was the civilized 
spots which formed the islands. And 
very small islands they were. There 
was no known native intelligent 
race, and settlements of alien 
races such as the men from Earth 
were still few and far between. 

So Lampert was prepared for 
McLaughlin’s care in readying the 
group for its trip. He was even glad 
of it, though he would probably not 
have admitted to being at all afraid 
of the venture. He would simply 
have said that it was nice to have a 
guide who took his responsibilities 
seriously. 

T hat of course, did not mean 
that Lampert was intending 
to disavow any of his own responsi- 
bilities. He, like McLaughlin, had 
been keeping a careful eye on the 
other members of the group, looking 
for the signs of impatience or ill 
temper which could be the seeds of 
serious trouble if the journey were 
prolonged. He had come to tenta- 
tive conclusions about this during 
the flight from Earth, but was 
pleased to see that, apparently, men 
who could stand the enforced com- 
panionship of a tramp spacer were 
also able to retain their senses of 
humor in the steam-bath environ- 
ment of Viridis. 

Sulewayo, of course, had seemed 
safe from the first. A man who has 
spent his formative years in the 
Congo rain forests where his ances- 
tors had lived for generations was 
ideal for this world. His sense of 
humor was extremely durable. 
Lampert suspected that it might 
12 


sometimes be a little too good. Mit- 
suitei, the archaeologist, had once 
or twice appeared to resent some of 
the young fellow’s remarks, though 
not to an extent where Lampert had 
felt the need for introducing his 
own personality into the matter. 
Krendall, nearly twice Sulewayo’s 
age, seemed to be a check on the 
younger man anyway; he was a 
member of the same profession, and 
Sulewayo would have been the first 
to admit his respect fdr Krendall’s 
work in the field. Under the cir- 
cumstances, Lampert felt that the 
group was well matched. 

Whether it would be able to do 
the job it had undertaken was an- 
other matter. The news reports had 
spoken glibly of the expedition 
which was going to “solve the mys- 
teries of Viridis once and for all.” 
Lampert, like any other scientist, 
knew perfectly well that the solu- 
tion of the present crop of mysteries 
about the planet would almost cer- 
tainly be achieved only at the cost 
of creating an even greater number 
of new ones. Even the guide, who 
was admittedly no scientist, had ex- 
pressed a similar opinion, though 
his was based on a general pessimism 
bred of familiarity with the planet. 
However, he had undertaken to get 
them to the sort of country they 
wanted; and from then on the prob- 
lem solving was not his affair. 

The scientists, whatever may have 
been their feeling about matters of 
personal safety, were eager to start, 
which tended to cause rapid pro- 
gress in McLaughlin’s animal rec- 
ognition school. Another factor 
tending toward the same result was 

IF 



that there was little in Emeraude 
for such men to do, except learn. 
The town was still small. It had a 
spaceport and airport, which fur- 
nished little entertainment, docks 
which could amuse for a while but 
not indefinitely, and warehouses 
which were completely uninteresting 
to geologists, paleontologists and 
archaeologists. There was no mu- 
seum. The numerous specimens of 
mineral, animal, and vegetable mat- 
ter collected on the planet invari- 
ably wound up on outbound space- 
craft. The zoo, which the town 
maintained for purely practical rea- 
sons, was about the only thing that 
was left. 

In consequence, not many days 
passed before all four scientists 
were able to meet McLaughlin’s re- 
quirements. Sulewayo was annoyed 
by the guide’s addition of a short 
postgraduate course in edible flora 
and fauna, but admitted that the 
knowledge might well be useful. 
However, he made no secret of his 
satisfaction when McLaughlin fi- 
nally announced that, as far as he 
was concerned, the journey could 
begin at any time. 

All four rechecked their equip- 
ment — that of Lampert was by far 
the bulkiest — and, everyone satis- 
fied with the group’s ability both to 
live and to work in the steam bath 
that was the world of Viridis, they 
watched the harbor on which Emer- 
aude was located shrink and blend 
into the rest of the shoreline behind 
them. Within a few minutes only 
the restless surface of Green Bay 
was visible through the ever-present 
haze. • • 


T he jaws of the Felodon ab- 
ruptly stopped moving and its 
forelegs straightened, bringing the 
fanged head up and away from the 
kill it had just made. 

If a man had been there he would 
neither have seen nor heard the 
disturbing factor, for a Thunder- 
storm a few miles to the west was 
emitting an almost fcontinous growl 
and the towering trees shut out 
nearly all the sky. Nevertheless the 
beast appeared to sense something 
out of the ordinary. It twisted its 
short but supple neck ceaselessly, 
rocking its head from side to side 
to bring first one eye and tympanic 
membrane to bear on the jungle 
roof, then the other. Sometimes it 
froze motionless for a long moment, 
and a watcher would have sworn 
that its minute brain was struggling 
with a thought. If this were the case, 
the thought must have been both 
unusual and unpleasant, for under 
normal circumstances nothing short 
of overwhelming force would have 
driven a Felodon from its meal. 
Now, however, the hind legs slowly 
straightened and the creature came 
erect. For another moment it stood 
motionless, took a step or two away 
from the body, and stopped again. 

Abruptly, as though in defiance 
of some impulse, it turned back, 
lowered the murderously armed 
head and tore a huge mouthful of 
flesh from the carcass. Then, like 
a child leaving the cookie jar as its 
mother approaches, it leaped away 
into the underbrush, still swallowing. 

Its speed was high and it did not 
have far to go. The jungle thinned 
in a few hundred meters to the 


THE GREEN WORLD 


13 



point where some sky became visi- 
ble, and a short distance further the 
riotous plant growth vanished com- 
pletely to give place to an open 
beach. Here the creature stopped 
and repeated its search of the hemis- 
phere overhead. 

This time it found what it sought. 

Along the line of the beach, per- 
haps a kilometer out to sea, the 
thing came flying. It must have been 
utterly different from anything the 
Felodon could ever have seen, but 
no sign of fear appeared in the 
beast’s demeanor. It stood on the 
beach, well away from the shelter 
of the jungle and certainly in full 
view from above, its head following 
the flying object and a fearful snarl 
— which might or might not have 
been its normal expression of hun- 
ger — giving its face an almost 
mammalian cast. 

This thing was larger by far than 
any flying creature the Felodon 
knew — incomparably larger than 
the Felodon itself. Its details were 
hard to make out through the hazy 
air, and would have meant little to 
the flesh-eater in any case. The most 
noticeable characteristic was the 
steady, whistling hum that proceeded 
from it. There was a suggestion of 
motion, too, which might have been 
wings or might not. Actually, the 
thing was* little more than a dark 
dot against the purplish-blue sky. At 
the -moment no sunlight was striking 
it directly, for it was in the shadow 
of the thunderhead. Perhaps this 
prevented the animal below from 
being bothered by another unusual 
feature it possessed, though even the 
appearance of this last characteris- 
14 


tic produced no sign of fear when 
it finally came. This occurred short- 
ly after the flying thing passed, while 
it was still quite close. It moved out 
of the shadow of the great cloud 
and, as the greenish sunlight struck 
it, the eyes of the watching crea- 
ture were dazzled by a gleam of 
metal. 

This was certainly something it 
had never seen, for native metal on 
Viridis is just about as common as 
it was on Earth before men began 
to pry it out of its ores. Viridis has 
an oxygen-rich atmosphere and plen- 
ty of moisture, and pure aluminum 
or chromium just doesn’t occur in 
that environment. 

Strange or not, however, the 
gleam did not appear to affect the 
Felodon’s rudimentary sense of fear. 
For just an instant it paused as the 
flying thing hummed on into the 
northeast; just once it looked back 
toward the point in the jungle where 
it had left its kill — a point from 
which eloquent sounds were now 
coming, betraying the presence of 
carrion-eaters; just one step it took 
in that direction. Then it turned 
away as abruptly as it had from the 
meal a few minutes before. With 
the same purposeful air it had dis- 
played on the way out of the jungle 
it headed down the beach in the 
direction taken by the flying piece 
of metal. 

Though the animal’s speed was 
high, the humming soon faded out 
ahead of it. 

However, this did not seem to 
cause any inconvenience; the Felo- 
don moved on, with a gait that might 
have been called a fast walk or a 

IF 



slow run, never hesitating, never 
pausing. It remained silent. Smaller 
creatures which might have given 
it a wide berth had they heard the 
hunting call now sprang away al- 
most from underfoot. It paid them 
no heed, but continued on its way 
while the green sun settled into the 
jungle behind and to its left. The 
fact that its recent kill was now 
little more than a skeleton did not 
seem to bother it. Perhaps it had 
forgotten. 

II 

T he humming was a little more 
noticeable in the helicopter 
cabin, but not much. John Mc- 
Laughlin, sprawled as comfortably 
as his two meters of height 
would permit in its confines, had 
noticed the sound only at first; and 
after remarking to himself that they 
seemed to be building better ion 
turbines since he had left Earth, had 
permitted his thoughts to wander in 
other directions. These did not con- 
cern Felodons; the interest there was 
not, at the moment, mutual. The 
rather crowded cabin offered ma- 
terial enough for consideration. 

McLaughlin was not a scientist 
by training, but neither was he the 
sort of guide that might have been 
found in Yukon or Amazon terri- 
tory a few centuries back. He did 
not despise people merely because 
they were, by his standards, green- 
horns. He knew that each of the 
other men now sharing this cabin 
with him was an expert in his own 
field, even though none of them, in 
spite of his training, would have 
THE GREEN WORLD 


been able to survive for more than 
a day in the jungles of Viridis. After 
all, why should they have learned 
such an art? There were other things 
worth learning, and one could al- 
ways hire McLaughlin if a need to 
visit the jungles developed. Since 
this particular party had done just 
that, they were evidently a fairly 
practical crew. 

They were not talking very much, 
which from the guide’s viewpoint 
was an additional point in their fa- 
vor. They already knew what they 
planned to do, and saw no point in 
repeating what had already been 
said. Of course, if they should fail 
to find the area they were seeking, 
there would be talk — all of it 
aimed at McLaughlin; but he had 
no fear on that score. There were 
few enough mountains on Viridis, 
and of those few by far the greater 
number were volcanic cinder cones. 
When these scientists had specified 
a region of tilted-block or folded 
mountains, the guide had been more 
than dubious at first. It had taken 
him time to recall that there was a 
small area meeting these specifica- 
tions less than fifteen hundred miles 
from the spaceport at Emeraude. 
He was not himself a geologist, but 
pictures and diagrams had been used 
freely in explaining to him just what 
was wanted, and he was quite cer- 
tain that the party would be satisfied 
with what he had to offer. 

A slight rocking in the hitherto 
steady motion of the helicopter 
roused him from this line of reverie. 
They were already several hours 
from Emeraude, and McLaughlin 
realized that he should have been 

15 



paying more attention to the course. 
He straightened up in his seat and 
looked out. 

To the left and ahead was a huge 
thunderhead, whose satellite air cur- 
rents had probably caused the varia- 
tion on the helicopter’s flight path. 
More important, there was land in 
sight. McLaughlin knew that the 
long flight across Green Bay was 
over. He waited, however, before 
saying anything. He had given the 
pilot full instructions as to the route 
before take-off, and he wanted to 
see whether those had been clear 
enough. 

Apparently they had. Without 
asking questions or even looking 
back at the guide, Lampert swung 
the aircraft from its northerly head- 
ing onto one which paralleled the 
shoreline, a turn of about forty-five 
degrees to the right, and the heli- 
copter resumed its steady flight. 

McLaughlin did not relax. From 
now on the route was a little more 
difficult to follow, and there were 
not too many more hours of day- 
light. The shadowless night glow 
which made vision relatively easy 
after sunset did not lend itself to 
aerial navigation over a very poorly 
mapped world. He kept his eyes on 
the shoreline, watching for the land- 
marks he h^d not seen for many 
months — and then not from above. 
He did not see the Felodon which 
became so intensely interested in 
the helicopter. If he had, he would 
have attached little importance to 
the creature’s presence, and he could 
not possibly have seen its actions in 
sufficient detail to catch any pecu- 
liarities in them. 


N o one else saw the beast, 
either. The change in course 
had roused most of the party from 
whatever lines of thought they had 
been pursuing, as it had McLaugh- 
lin, and most of them were looking 
out the windows; but they were in- 
terested in what lay ahead, not be- 
low. Sometime soon the relative 
monotony of jungle and swamp 
should be relieved by rising ground, 
indicating the nearness of the moun- 
tains they sought; and the helicop- 
ter’s flight altitude of some two 
thousand feet was low enough to 
permit any significant rise of terrain 
to be visible. Sulewayo, the younger 
paleontologist, made a remark to 
that effect, which passed without 
comment. Real conversation did not 
start for some minutes. 

“As I understand it, we have 
one more course change before we 
see the mountains. Isn’t there a 
river we have to follow for a time, 
String?” Lampert asked the question 
without looking back. 

“That’s right,” McLaughlin re- 
plied. “It runs into Green Bay from 
almost straight north, and about a 
hundred miles inland makes a turn 
to the east. That’s general direction. 
It winds a lot.” 

“It would, in country as nearly 
peneplaned as this,” muttered Lamp- 
ert under his breath. 

“The mountains you want start 
about sixty airline miles from the 
big bend. If you trust your gyro 
compass enough, you can head for 
them directly from the river mouth. 
If you have any doubt about being 
able to hold a line, though, follow 
the river. I doubt that there are any 

IP 


16 



good landmarks otherwise. Of 
course, I’ve only seen the area from 
the surface and close to the river, 
but I’d be very surprised if there 
was anything around but the swamp- 
and-jungle mess we’re over now.” 

“So would I. We’ll stay in sight of 
the river, but edge as far east as 
visibility lets us.” The guide ap- 
proved this plan with a nod, and the 
conversation lapsed for several min- 
utes. The silence was finally broken 
once more by Sulewayo. 

“I hope these hills we’re looking 
for have something of interest. This 
planet is the most monotonous I’ve 
seen yet. Where it isn’t jungle it’s 
swamp; and the only difference be- 
tween the two is that the jungle 
grows higher trees.” McLaughlin’s 
face crinkled into something like a 
smile, and he sat up once more. 

“There’s one other difference,” he 
remarked. 

“What’s that?” 

“In the jungle, dressed and 
equipped as you now are, you might 
live as long as a day. In the swamp, 
five minutes would be an optimistic 
estimate.” Sulewayo looked down at 
the shorts and boots which consti- 
tuted his costume, and shrugged. 

“I admit the point, but I don’t 
expect to go out this way. What I 
actually wear and carry, beside my 
professional equipment, is up to you. 
Also, I was referring to appearances. 
Beta Lyrae Nine looked almost as 
dull as this world from above, and 
I’ll bet it was as least as deadly when 
you reached the surface.” McLaugh- 
lin had never visited New Sheol, 
and admitted it, but it took more 
than that to stop Sulewayo. 

THE GREEN WORLD 


“Actually, I was hoping that these 
hills didn’t turn out to be so covered 
with soil that any fossils would be 
yards underground at the best. Do 
you recall any places where the rock 
strata themselves were exposed — 
steep cliffs, or deep stream gullies, 
perhaps?” 

“Definitely yes. The big river cuts 
right across the range, or else starts 
in it. It comes out from a canyon 
like that of the Colorado on Earth, 
though a lot less spectacular. Ac- 
tually I don’t know anything about 
the country more than a couple of 
miles up that canyon. I was stopped 
on the river by rapids, and couldn’t 
get my amphib out on either side. 
For the most part there simply 
wasn’t any shore, just cliff.” 

“Quite a current, I suppose?” 
Lampert cut in. 

“Actually, not very much. I went 
swimming in worse, on Earth.” 

4 Cnphat hardly ties in with 
A steep cliffs and a river cutting 
through a mountain range.” 
McLaughlin shrugged. “You’re the 
geologist. Look it over for yourself. 
Maybe you’ll just have to add it to 
the list of things you don’t under- 
stand about Viridis.” 

“Fair enough.” The pilot-com- 
mander-geophysicist nodded. “I did 
not mean to imply that you were 
not reporting accurately; but the 
situation you have described would 
be a trifle queer on more planets 
than Earth, I assure you. Still, with 
luck your cliffs will show fossils. 
Maybe we’ll solve one problem in 
exchange for another. Life could be 
worse.” 

17 



“Just hope we don’t solve the first 
one by proving that certain geophys- 
icists have been talking through their 
hats,” the hitherto silent Krendall 
remarked. 

“Eh?” 

“What would you do if we found 
a chunk of, say, pegmatite with 
radioactive inclusions that checked 
out at half a billion years instead of 
the thirty-odd million you lads have 
been giving us as a time scale for 
this mudball?” 

“I should check very carefully 
under what circumstances and in 
what location you found it. If nec- 
essary, I would admit that the prob- 
lem had disappeared. Half a billion 
years would account reasonably well 
for the evolutionary status of this 
planet’s life forms, though actually 
it took Earth a good deal longer to 
reach a corresponding condition. 
Frankly, however, I do not expect 
any such find. We spotted our bor- 
ings rather carefully, and should 
have taken pretty representative 
samples.” 

“I’m sure you did. If your results 
are right, it just means that the 
problem belongs to Hans and me 
— and String here had better find 
us a lot of fossils.” 

“You’ll have to find your own 
bones,” McLaughlin replied. “I’m 
taking you to the sort of ground 
you want. A fossil would have to 
show its teeth in my face before I’d 
recognize it — and then I’d prob- 
ably shoot before I realized it was 
dead.” 

“All right,” Sulewayo chuckled. 
“You take care of the quick, and 
Krendall and I will worry about the 

16 


dead. Dr. Lampert can figure out 
how old the fossils are if we find 
any, and Take can look for stone 
axes.” 

“Or automobiles, or pieces of 
space-drive tubes, or other artifacts,” 
Mitsuitei answered the implied dig. 
“I plan to sit back and loaf, unless 
and until one of you lads turns up a 
skull that could have held more than 
half an ounce of brain. I am going 
to be very unscientific. I believe 
that there is nothing on this planet 
for an archeologist to do, and I 
am not going to work myself into a 
lather to prove myself wrong.” 
“You’ve formed an opinion rather 
early in the game,” Lampert re- 
marked. “After all, remarkably little 
of this world has been explored. 
Why should there not be traces of 
occupation in unknown areas such 
as we are about to visit?” 

“Because, while most of the planet 
remains unexplored, a very large 
number of places which should have 
furnished traces of habitation have 
failed to do so. We’ve surveyed 
many spots which were, or are, ideal 
for cities based on ocean commerce, 
or market centers for what could be 
farm areas, or spaceports. After a 
while you get to a point where such_ 
finds can be predicted with some 
certainty. As I said, I am far from 
certain, and it would be most un- 
reasonable to say I was; but in the 
area we are seeking, I see no reason 
to expect anything of interest to my 
profession.” 

L ampert shrugged and brought 
his full attention back to 
the controls. The sun was slowly 

IF 



sinking, bringing into bolder relief 
the irregularities of the ground as 
their shadows lengthened. However, 
these irregularities were still few, 
and the jungle roof was for the 
most part evenly illuminated. As 
McLaughlin had expected, there was 
nothing that could be used as a 
landmark. In its own way, the forest 
was as featureless as the ocean. The 
pilot kept his gaze riveted ahead, in 
expectation of the river which the 
guide had told them to expect; and 
presently he saw it. Reflecting the 
color of the faintly purplish sky, it 
stood out fairly well against the 
gray-green of the jungle, once they 
were close enough to penetrate the 
ever-present haze. 

With McLaughlin nodding silent 
approval, Lampert swung the heli- 
copter to the left and proceeded 
more nearly straight north, angling 
gradually toward the river. Now 
the jungle took on a little more fea- 
ture, though still nothing that could 
be used for guidance. At fairly fre- 
quent intervals a glint of water be- 
came visible through the trees di- 
rectly below them. Evidently num- 
erous tributaries were feeding into 
the larger stream; but none of these 
could be seen from any distance. 
For the most part they were so 
narrow that the trees growing on 
each side met above them. 

“I should think that one could 
cover a great deal of that territory 
in a boat,” remarked Mitsuitei, after 
nearly half an hour in the new di- 
rection. 

“ You’d need an amphib,” replied 
the guide. “A boat is all right for 
the main stream, but all that stuff 
THE GREEN WORLD 


coming in from the sides is so shal- 
low that you’d never make progress 
with anything else. I’ve tried most 
of them in my own croc. Every 
time I’ve had to crawl rather than 
float before I was a mile from the 
river. 

“How is the ground? Swamp?” 

“No, it’s fairly solid for the most 
part. It doesn’t show very well yet 
even with the sun as low as it is, 
but the general ground level is push- 
ing up slowly all along here. We’ll 
be in sight of your mountains before 
too long.” 

This declaration brought all mem- 
bers of the group to the windows, 
all five pairs of eyes covering the 
quadrant of vision below and ahead. 
The meandering river was now on 
their left, but just visible through 
the haze ahead of them was the 
eastward turn McLaughlin had pre- 
dicted. Lampert headed a little 
more to the right in an attempt to 
cut the final corner, but the heli- 
copter reached the winding purplish 
band before their goal came in sight 
in spite of this effort. The flyer 
hummed on. 

The bars of sunlight admitted by 
the side ports had been nearly hori- 
zontal when the turn to the east cut 
them off. They were only slightly 
more so when McLaughlin gave a 
satisfied grunt, and nodded forward. 
The others followed his gaze. 

S traight ahead, little could be 
seen because of the “bright 
spot” familiar to every flyer — the 
shadowless area directly opposite 
the sun, centered on the aircraft’s 
own shadow. To either side, how- 

19 



ever, the promised hills rose out of 
the jungle to heights exceeding the 
present flight altitude of the heli- 
copter. Presumably the canyon from 
which the river was supposed to 
emerge lay in their path. So, at any 
rate, Lampert remarked; and Mc- 
Laughlin confirmed him. 

“I’d cruise pretty slowly from here 
on,” the guide added. “There are a 
number of hills on this side of the 
range. Even if you’re not worried 
about running into one of them, 
you may want to examine them for 
exposed rocks.” 

“Mightn’t it be better to find a 
spot to park before the sun goes 
down?” countered the pilot. 

“It might. What I said still holds, 
though. You haven’t much chance 
finding one inside the canyon with- 
out quite a long search, and it will 
be best to stay this side of the range 
until sunrise. Remember my trouble 
in finding a beach for the amphib 
while I was inside.” 

“All right. Can we land in jungle, 
though?” 

“Not unless you want to fold the 
blades in flight and drop the last 
twenty to fifty feet. Hunt for a 
fairly high hill. They’re usually some- 
what bare on top, and you’ll at 
least have room for the rotors to 
swing. If you don’t like that, or can’t 
find a suitsfble hilltop, land on the 
river and tie up to the shore — but 
again, don’t try that in the canyon. 
You’re unlikely to find anything to 
tie up to.” 

“This machine has good lights, I 
suppose you realize — but then, you 
know the planet. As far as I’m con- 
cerned, what you say goes. Are the 
20 


chances of a hill equally good on 
either side of the river?” 

“Maybe a little better to the north. 
The ground looked higher that way 
when I came out of the canyon.” 
Lampert obediently eased the flyer’s 
course a trifle to the left, and every- 
one aboard watched the ground as 
it began to rise toward them. 

At first the “hills” were merely 
low mounds, as jungle-covered as 
the level ground; but very quickly 
these gave way to higher, steeper 
rises on whose tops the larger trees 
grew very sparsely. One of these 
was quickly selected after a brief, 
questioning glance from Lampert to 
the guide, and the helicopter began 
to descend. 

“We’d better take what we have 
now. ’’.McLaughlin amplified the nod 
with which he had answered the 
pilot. “This belt of hills is pretty 
narrow, and we’d be into the main 
range in another minute or two.” 
“Do you know whether the other 
side is as abrupt, or whether — ” 
Lam pert’s question was cut short 
by an exclamation from Mitsuitei. 
“Rob! Hold it a moment!” 
Lampert was a good pilot; the 
increase in rotor-blade pitch under 
his deft fingers brought the heli- 
copter’s descent to as nearly an in- 
stant halt as was possible to any- 
thing airborne. Not until he had also 
checked horizontal drift did he look 
in the direction the archaeologist 
was indicating. By then, everyone 
else had seen what had attracted 
Mitsuitei’s attention. 

Between the hill on which Lamp- 
ert had intended to land and the 
river were several lower eminences. 

IF 






THE GREEN WORLD 






These were now almost directly 
south of the helicopter, and every 
detail upon them was shown in ex- 
aggerated relief by shadows stretch- 
ing to the east. It was one of these 
hills which Mitsuitei was examining 
with the utmost care. 

It was covered with jungle, like 
the rest; but a curious regularity 
was visible. The trees appeared, at 
this distance, to be of the usual 
species; but some of them towered 
over their fellows by a good thirty 
or forty feet. 

This in itself was not odd. The 
whole jungle was studded with such 
projections. However, on this hill 
the taller trees seemed to have been 
planted in orderly rows. Five solid 
lines of them were visible, extend- 
ing roughly north and south so 
that their long shadows made them 
stand out sharply. They were sepa- 
rated from each other by perhaps a 
quarter of a mile. Running at right 
angles to them were other, less out- 
standing rows of vegetation. Lamp- 
ert was not quite sure that these 
were not the product of his own 
imagination, since the trees which 
formed them rose little if any above 
the general level. The whole hilltop, 
however, suggested something to 
every man who saw it. The archae- 
ologist was .the first to give voice 
to the impression. 

“That was a city!” 

N o one answered. Some of the 
scientists must have thought 
that he was jumping from one 
opinion to its direct opposite on 
the strength of some rather feeble 
evidence; but the thought went un- 
22 


voiced. They simply looked — ex- 
cept for Sulewayo, who moved to 
turned a camera on the scene. 

“Rob! Can we land there? Now?” 
Lampert had anticipated this ques- 
tion, but could have answered it 
without hesitation in any case. 

‘‘Sure — if you don’t mind using 
String’s method of folding the blades 
and falling in.” The archaeologist 
turned to the guide. 

“Will it be hard to gel there on 
foot from this hill we’re heading 
for?” McLaughlin shrugged. 

“From two hours to a day, de- 
pending on undergrowth.” 

“We have torches. We can burn 
our way if the vegetation is dense.” 
“Half a day, then. You’ll still have 
to let the steam clear pretty often. 
There’s little wind below the trees, 
and the air is saturated.” 

“Well, that place will be worth 
more than a day of anyone’s time. 
Maybe tomorrow we can — ” 

“Hold up a moment, Take!” 
Lampert cut in, before Mitsuitei 
could develop his plan further. “If 
you take String out to that hill be- 
fore take-off tomorrow, what do 
the rest of us do for the day — or 
week — before you get back? What 
we’d better do is note this placepgt? 
on to the canyon, set up camp, get 
the fossil hunting going, and after 
our routine is set up and we know 
the more common dangers of the 
neighborhood, perhaps we can spare 
McLaughlin for a day or two so 
that you can look over your city — 
if that’s what it is.” 

Lam pert’s last few words ban- 
ished the hurt expression from the 
little man’s face. 


IF 



“What do you mean — if? What 
else could make a pattern like that? 
It must have been streets.” 

“Or a joint system in the rock 
below, trapping enough water — or 
draining enough off — to permit 
superior growth along the joint 
lines. Or a system of tilted strata 
doing the same thing — ” 

“If it’s the latter, it’s just the sort 
of thing you want, too. It should 
bring fossils near the surface.” 

The pilot nodded slowly. “You do 
make it sound more attractive. 
Still, I think we’d better follow the 
original plan, except that I may 
come with you myself when we do 
get around to looking that hill over.” 
He turned back to the controls and 
resumed their descent. Mitsuitei sub- 
sided once more to his seat. The 
archaeologist realized the wisdom of 
Lampert’s decision, but did not par- 
ticularly enjoy the enforced wait. 
His face showed the fact, until Sule- 
wayo opened the camera he had 
been using and passed him the sheaf 
of prints on which the “city” ap- 
peared. As the young paleontologist 
had expected, these so occupied the 
little man’s attention that he did not 
even notice the landing. 

T he helicopter settled to the 
hilltop which Lampert had 
chosen, in the center of a quad- 
rangle of trees growing just far 
enough apart to give clearance to 
the rotors. 

The sun was nearly gone. It had 
vanished in the haze as they dropped 
below flight altitude. McLaughlin 
knew that in all too short a time 
it would be as dark as Viridis ever 
THE GREEN WORLD 


became. The nights could be dan- 
gerous. There was quite enough light 
to deceive a man into thinking he 
could see clearly, and an inexperi- 
enced wanderer might not realize 
until too late that details were not 
really distinct and that there was no 
clue to direction in the shadowless 
glow. McLaughlin himself could use 
the moons, but he doubted that any 
other member of the party could 
do so. They — or their motions — 
took knowing. 

He was pleased to note that there 
was no general rush to the door as 
the great blades whistled gently to 
a stop. The scientists turned to him, 
but remained where they were. No 
words were spoken, but Lampert’s 
relinquishment of command was evi- 
dent. McLaughlin unfolded his 
length from the seat. 

“There are two choices,” he said. 
“We can sleep in the ’copter, or out- 
side. The first will be a trifle 
cramped, but the second will require 
either a double circle of charged 
wire or two armed guards on con- 
stant watch. With no offense meant, 
I doubt that anyone but myself in 
this group could qualify as a night 
guard.” 

“Why a double circle of wire?” 
asked Lampert. 

“The wire will stop only an animal 
in control of its motion when it 
makes contact. If a Felodon were 
to spring from a little distance, it 
might not like the wire — but it 
could hardly stop until it reached 
the ground, and there should then 
be a similar barrier ahead of it.” 

“We could use a lethal voltage.” 

“Even if you want to take the 

23 



m 


risk — what is lethal to a Felodon 
will be equally so to a man — you’ll 
have the insulation problem. There’s 
always a darned good chance of 
rain before morning, and — ” 

“We might as well stay inside, 
then. We have the electric equip- 
ment, but it will take quite a while 
to set it up; and it hardly seems 
worth the trouble for a one-night 
stand. As you say, it will be a little 
crowded here. But we’ve all slept 
under worse conditions. Would any- 
one rather set up the fence?” 

There was no answer to this ques- 
tion. At Lampert’s direction a meal 
was served and eaten. Then the 
scientists settled down for the night, 
some to sleep at once, others to re- 
view plans or recheck equipment. 
Mitsuitei occupied himself with 
making careful measurements of the 
photographs he had been given; he 
was the last asleep. 

Scores of miles to the southwest, 
the Felodon reached the river. It 
was no longer on the coast; some 
time since it had swerved inland. A 
casual compass check would have 
revealed that it was still heading 
straight for the now grounded heli- 
copter. Even McLaughlin could not 
have told what led the creature on, 
familiar as he was with the animals 
of Viridis; but no one who had 
watched the -thing since the flying 
machine had passed could have 
doubted its goal. Actually, it was 
now on the same bank of the river 
as the helicopter; but whatever 
guided it pointed across the great 
stream. 

Without hesitating, the amphibid 
plunged into the water. 

24 


T he men were awake well be- 
fore sunrise. The human body 
takes a long, long time to accustom 
its physiological cycle to a change 
in something as fundamental as the 
length of day. But they did not at- 
tempt to resume flight until the 
green star was once more in the 
sky. Mitsuitei put forth a tentative 
suggestion that the interval be spent 
in a visit to the “city” site he had 
seen the night before, but McLaugh- 
lin vetoed it. 

“Going on foot through the jungle 
at night is a fool’s game, though I 
admit people sometimes get away 
with it. I could get you there, but 
even if we turned around and came 
back immediately there’d be a lot of 
time wasted. Dr. Lampert went over 
all that last night. Look, that hill of 
yours is right by the river. After 
we’re set up in the main camp, it 
will be relatively easy to drop down 
to it. We have collapsible boats. 
Unless we camp above the rapids, 
you won’t even have to fly. Even if 
we’re farther upstream and do have 
to use the ’copter, the trip will take 
only a few minutes.” 

Mitsuitei had agreed, though with 
evident reluctance. No one else had 
any desire to go out; there was not 
enough rock exposed on the hilltop 
to excite the paleontologists, the hill 
itself presented nothing unusual to 
Lampert’s geophysical eye, and Mc- 
Laughlin was in no hurry to get to 
work. They waited, therefore, until 
the “Claw” — Lampert had recalled 
Beta Librae’s Arabic name — had 
risen and the skyglow been replaced 

IF 



by its emerald brilliance; then the 

journey was resumed. 

It took, as McLaughlin had said 
the night before, only a few minutes. 
The' hill where they had slept was 
less than five miles from the face of 
the mountain range. Only the haze 
of the night before had prevented 
their seeing it. The river emerged 
from a canyon some fifteen hundred 
feet in depth, a couple of miles to 
the south of their eastward course 
line. 

Lampert, in hopes that the 
usual haze might not be too evident 
at this hour, climbed above the level 
of the cliff top to get an idea of the 
mountain range as a whole; but he 
was disappointed. For nearly an 
hour he cruised over the area, now 
several thousand feet above the 
western cliffs and then well below 
them. It slowly became evident that 
the range represented a single block, 
which had been tilted upward on 
the west side. The opposite slopes 
were very gentle, merging so gradu- 
ally into the general peneplain level 
of the continent that it was impos- 
sible to say decisively just where the 
range ended. The river did originate 
somewhere beyond the range, cut- 
ting entirely through it, and as the 
guide had said, its current was not 
particularly swift. Lampert had 
much explaining to do. After all, 
water should have drained toward 
the low side of the block. 

“It seems evident,” he summed up 
his ideas as they hovered once more 
over the western cliffs, “that the 
river was here before this particular 
bit of block tilting occurred. This 
planet does have some diastrophic 
THE GREEN WORLD 


forces left in its crust, in spite of its 
generally smooth nature. Apparent- 
ly this just represents the end of a 
long period of rest, such as the 
earth has had several times. As a 
matter of fact, I have no business 
calling it the end of such a period; 
it might be fifty million years before 
the world will be generally moun- 
tainous again.” 

“Why do you say again , Rob?” 
asked Krendall. “According to find- 
ings of your own colleagues, this 
planet has hardly been solid for 
forty million years. Could it be this 
flat now if it had ever been marked- 
ly mountainous in that time?” 

“Good point. I don’t know, but 
would be inclined to doubt it. Well, 
we’ll cancel the ‘again’ if it will 
make you happy. In any case the 
block forming this range came up 
slowly enough so that even this river, 
with its relatively low cutting power, 
was able to keep pace with it and 
not be deflected. Probably — ” he 
glanced at Mitsuitei — “the rock of 
which it is made will turn out to be 
quite strongly jointed. It looks rather 
that way from above — the river 
course, I mean. A lot of right angle, 
or what were once right angle, 
bends.” 

“We’d better go down and look 
for a camp along the river some- 
where,” put in Mitsuitei. “Let’s start 
at the cliff end. Then we may wind 
up reasonably close to that hill — 
and I still want to look it over, 
joints or no joints.” 

“Fair enough.” Lampert eased the 
helicopter once more downward un- 
til they were only a few hundred 
feet above the jungle, moved along 

25 



the cliff face until they reached the 
canyon, and, very cautiously, en- 
tered. His caution proved unneces- 
sary. The air currents in no way 
resembled the treacherous hodge- 
podge he had expected, at least not 
over the center of the river. A 
steady wind was blowing into the 
canyon mouth, but did not seem to 
be eddying very much even at the 
numerous bends. 

T o the archeologist’s annoy- 

ance, two sets of rapids were 
passed before a place was reached 
where the bank was wide enough for 
a camp site. At this point a fairly 
large side canyon entered the main 
one from the north. Where its cen- 
tral stream joined the main river a 
gravelly area several acres in extent 
offered itself for the purposes of 
the scientists. Lampert brought the 
helicopter down on this surface. 
The surroundings looked promising; 
the clifls facing both canyons looked 
reasonably accessible on foot for 
some distance, at least along their 
bases. Climbing appeared to be im- 
practicable for the most part, as 
the rock walls rose sheer except for 
the occasional joints which Lampert 
had predicted; but the material was 
certainly sedimentary, and everyone 
but the guide tumbled out of the 
flyer with a glow in his eyes which 
promised a speedy scattering of the 
party. 

With some difficulty, McLaughlin 
got them together. A site, some 
twenty yards square, was selected 
against one of the cliffs and fenced 
off. The big, prefabricated sheet- 
metal “tent” was erected and its tiny 
26 


conditioning unit installed; sleeping 
and cooking gear were placed in- 
side. That completed, geologist’s 
hammers appeared as though by 
magic; and McLaughlin realized 
that he had better do some explain- 
ing before he lost a scientist or two. 
Once more he called them together. 

“All right, gentlemen. I admit the 
necessary camp work has been done, 
and there should be nothing to keep 
you from your projects. Still, there 
are some things you Had better 
understand. 

“Having canyon walls on all sides 
does not make this place safe. Every 
carnivore and poison lizard on this 
planet could get to us by way of the 
river — even the ones which look 
like land animals. Every one of them 
could swim under water from a 
point out of sight in either direction 
to where you are standing; and if 
you think he would have to come 
up at least once to judge your posi- 
tion, guess again. I don’t know how 
they do it, and neither does anyone 
else; but a Felodon could submerge 
around the bend up there, come up 
behind the helicopter out of sight 
of any one of us and be waiting 
when we marched around the ma- 
chine. Therefore, go armed at all 
times. I know you want to cover a 
lot of ground, and can’t stick in one 
party; but I insist that you do not 
go anywhere alone. Take at least 
one companion. Preferably one who 
is not a member of your own field. 
If you two paleontologists are to- 
gether, for example, it seems more 
than likely that you’ll be found with 
your heads in the same hole in the 
rock. When one of you has to dig, 

IF 



make sure the other has his neck on 
a swivel. I know this will slow your 
work, but not as much as if the 
work had to wait for a new investi- 
gating team from Emeraude — or 
from Earth. 

“You’ve seen most of the danger- 
ous animals in the zoo at Emeraude, 
so I won’t waste time describing 
them. Just remember that you won't 
always hear them coming. You’ll 
have to use your eyes. 

“All right, Dr. Lampert. You’re 
the boss, as far as the scientific 
work goes. Who does what, and 
where?” 

T he geophysicist gave no sign 
of having detected the humor 
in the guide’s remark, but began 
speaking at once. 

“I should say that the main can- 
yon upstream and the side one in 
the same direction should be covered 
first. We’ve already used up a good 
deal of today, and would waste more 
breaking out the boats. Ndomi and 
I will go up the main stream; Hans 
and Take can take the other. Don’t 
hurry. If anything looks good, take 
the time to investigate it on the spot. 
Of course, if it is obviously a major 
job, just mark it and go on. There’s 
no sense in one man’s trying to ex- 
hume a six-foot lizard skull. 

“Since this region must have been 
sea when the limestone was de- 
posited, there’s not much chance of 
land animals. However, we want as 
complete a chronological series as 
possible, so do the best you can on 
this level. We’ll try for higher forma- 
tions later. There should be plenty 
farther upriver, if this block is tilted 
THE GREEN WORLD 


the way it seems to be. 

“String, perhaps you’d better go 
with Take and Hans. Set out when 
you’re ready. Be back in — ” he 
glanced automatically at the narrow 
strip of purplish-blue sky, then at 
his watch — “four hours; then we’ll 
compare notes. After that we can 
either concentrate on one place or 
the other, or break out the boats 
and cross the streams, as indicated.” 

Twenty minutes later the parties 
were out of sight of each other and 
the helicopter. Lampert had spent 
the first few minutes of the walk 
wondering whether he had been too 
obvious in arranging for both the 
guide and Krendall to accompany 
the little archaeologist; but he quick- 
ly convinced himself that McLaugh- 
lin’s speech had covered the ar- 
rangements pretty well. 

In any case, he would probably 
have been distracted soon enough. 
The cliffs were interesting. Lime- 
stone, evidently, as expected — but 
rather dense, at that; maybe some 
barium replacing the calcium? or 
was the gravity different enough to 
destroy his judgement for such a 
small fragment? Probably not. He 
was actually using inertia more than 
weight in making his estimate. Any- 
way, the stuff was certainly a car- 
bonate. It frothed satisfyingly under 
a drop of acid from Lampert’s kit. 

And there were fossils. Sulewayo’s 
form was bent over a spot on the 
cliff face, examining minutely; but 
Lampert could see others from 
where he stood. None seemed re- 
markable. Most were rather evident- 
ly shellfish. He carefully refrained 
from giving them names according 

27 



to the genera they resembled in 
Earth’s rocks; Sulewayo and his col- 
leagues frowned on the practice, 
which could be most misleading. He 
could not, however, resist the temp- 
tation to think of them as scallops. 

“What do you have there, Ndomi?” 
He knew the other would not have 
spent so long on any shellfish. 

“Not sure, precisely. Maybe verte- 
brate, maybe not. What could be 
armor and what could be ribs all 
mixed up. I think I’ll mark it for 
future reference.” 

“I suppose it’ll be another Devon- 
ian whatsit, like everything else on 
this planet, when you do decide.” 
“Pennsylvanian would better de- 
scribe the world as a whole. Barring 
that, you may be right. Rob, if you’d 
give me a hand here we could get 
some basic work done.” 

“Eh?” 

“You say this is a tilted block. In 
lowest formations right now. I’d like 
to get photos and if possible speci- 
mens of as many different varieties 
of shellfish as possible, at each level. 
Then it may be possible to set up 
some sort of temporal sequence — 
and use the things as index fossils 
if animals do evolve on this be- 
nighted mudball. If you could get 
me some radioactive dates at two 
or three nicely scattered levels, it 
would also help.” 

“Thanks,” returned Lampert drily. 
“I could use material like that my- 
self. I can tell you what you prob- 
ably already know — you’re not 
likely to get anything of the sort 
from limestone.” 

“Well — intrusions are always 
possible.” 

28 


“You watch for ’em, then.” The 
pair went to work. 

T wo hours out, a little more 
than one back. There was no 
one at the helicopter when they 
reached it, but the other group came 
in only a few minutes over the four- 
hour limit which Lampert had im- 
posed. A comparison of notes over 
the meal which had been quickly 
prepared indicated that the second 
group had gone farther in point of 
miles covered, but had accomplished 
less work. Krendall had had the 
same idea as Sulewayo. But he had 
not attempted to carry it out since 
his canyon did not cut across the 
range, and would presumably not 
furnish a continous change in forma- 
tions. 

Lampert and Sulewayo, as it hap- 
pened, had not found any evidence 
of change themselves. The last fos- 
sils they had found were at least 
superficially identical with the first. 
There was the usual evidence of 
bedding, and it had been quite evi- 
dent geometrically that the walk had 
taken them to originally higher, and 
presumably later, levels; but in what 
must have been eight hundred feet 
or more of original deposit, there 
seemed to have been no significant 
change in the fossil life. What eight 
hundred feet would mean in point 
of time, of course, no one had the 
least idea. There was not even a 
good guess as to how fast carbon- 
ates might be expected to precipitate 
in a Viridian ocean. Anyone could 
compute the carbonate ion equilib- 
rium between atmosphere and sea, 
but no one knew anything to speak 

IF 



of about carbonate-precipitating or- 
ganisms of the planet. 

Mitsuitei changed the subject 
slightly at this point. 

“We found several of the joints 
you predicted,” he said to Lampert. 

“Oh? Very wide? We didn’t spot 
anything that was obviously a joint. 
But there were several small side 
canyons — all narrow enough for us 
to wade or jump their central 
streams — which might have started 
life that way.” 

“Ours were quite narrow, and 
bore traces of volcanic ash at the 
bottoms.” 

“Eh?” 

“That’s right, Rob. Here’s a bit of 
it I brought back. I thought you 
might want a little corroboration on 
that one.” Krendall handed over a 
bit of crumbly tuff as he spoke. 
Lampert examined it with pursed 
lips. 

“Maybe we’d better get back in- 
to the air, and search the neighbor- 
hood for volcanoes,” he said at last. 
“I can’t bring myself to believe in 
two full mountain-building cycles on 
this planet — and if I could, I’d have 
a hard time swallowing the idea of 
these limestone layers coming up, 
going down, and coming up again 
unaltered. How deep were these 
volcanic deposits?” 

“Variable. Shallowest in the wider 
joints; in the very narrow ones, up 
out of sight.” 

“Suggesting that they’ve been 
washing out for some time since the 
original settling. Anything organic 
in them?” 

“Nothing turned up yet.” 

“Do they extend below the pres- 

THE GREEN WORLD 


ent river level, or what?" 

“They’re at least down to it. We 
couldn’t do any major excavating.” 
“If they run much below,” mut- 
tered Lampert, “I’ll join the roster 
of geophysicists who have been 
driven off the rails by this woozy 
world. Well, let’s assume as a work- 
ing hypothesis that the volcanic ac- 
tivity is relatively recent. That will 
at least have the advantage of keep- 
ing me sane, until something comes 
up to disprove it.” He finished his 
meal in silence, while McLaughlin 
gave a reproving lecture on the mat- 
ter of wading. 

T here was still a little daylight 
to go when all the men had 
eaten; and Lampert, Sulewayo and 
the archaeologist took the helicop- 
ter up the main canyon to check on 
the possibility of walking to any real- 
ly new deposits. 

They were sure, from changes of 
color already seen at various levels 
up the cliff face, that these existed. 
But it appeared that the lowest of 
them did not reach river level for 
more than a dozen miles. The dis- 
tance was less mapwise, but the can- 
yon, winding back and forth around 
what the geophysicist still felt must 
be joint-bounded blocks, went a 
good two miles in other directions 
for each one that it led eastward. 
Realizing this, the explorers lifted 
the helicopter and began checking 
as close to the cliffs as Lampert 
dared at higher levels. In this way 
they worked back toward the camp 
site. Once again it was Mitsuitei 
who first spotted something of major 
interest. 


29 



“Found another city, Take?” 
asked Sulewayo at the other’s call. 

“Not exactly. It’s — well, I guess 
it’s really a system of those joints 
you keep talking about. Still, it looks 
awfully regular.” He sounded a little 
wistful. 

“It does.” The paleontologist 
nodded slowly. “As you say, it’s 
probably a joint system. Also, it’s 
probably full of volcanic ash, if my 
eyes don’t deceive me. Rob, what’s 
the chance of a landing on one of 
the shelves? There are at least three 
formations accessible on foot from 
that point; and I could get some 
more tuff samples to make or break 
your peace of mind, while I was do- 
ing my own work.” 

Lampert examined the area care- 
fully. Like Earth’s Grand Canyon, 
this one receded from time to time 
in shelves where softer layers of 
rock had worn further back, or the 
orogenic processes had paused to 
give the river a longer bite at that 
level. The cracks Mitsuitei had seen 
formed a neat crisscross pattern on 
the top of one of the shelves. Some 
of them betrayed their nature by 
emerging from its vertical face. It 
was admittedly an unusually small- 
scale joint pattern, at least for this 
mountain system, and might well 
contain readable evidence of the 
forces which had shaped the area. 

However, they had only one heli- 
copter. Lampert slowly shook his 
head in negation. 

“I’m afraid not, Ndomi. Your 
shelves may be big enough, but 
they’re not level enough. I’d have 
to make a swinging landing, and 
I’m not that good a pilot.” 

30 


“Well, how about letting me down 
on the ladder? We have a hundred 
feet of that, so you could be up 
above the next shelf while I went 
down. You’d have plenty of blade 
clearance. That next level goes back 
a couple of hundred feet.” 

“That might be all right.” Lampert 
spoke hesitantly. “You certainly have 
the right to risk your own neck on 
the climb if you want to. We won’t 
try it tonight, though. I’d like to 
check with String on the advisability 
of your being there alone. The place 
looks pretty hard to reach for any- 
thing that doesn’t fly, and I don’t 
know of any really dangerous flying 
things on this world; but we’d still 
better check.” 

“All right with me. I’d just as 
soon have a full day, anyway.” 
“If Ndomi will be spending a day 
alone up here, how about having 
String take me to the other place, 
and settle that point once and for 
all?” asked Mitsuitei as the helicop- 
ter eased downward toward the 
camp. “That would still leave Hans 
and you to form another team for 
whatever else you want to do.” 
“That should be all right. It’ll de- 
pend, though, on whether String 
thinks it’s safe for a man to work 
alone on that shelf.” 

The proposition was put to Mc- 
Laughlin as soon as the machine 
was landed. To Lampert’s surprise, 
the guide gave a qualified approval. 

“Remember,” he concluded, “I 
don’t know what lives on the cliffs. 
It’s country I’ve never covered. All 
I’m saying is that no Viridian animal 
I know of could get there, except 
flying ones; and they’re nothing to 

IF 



worry about, especially in the day- 
time. I’d like to go with you to look 
over the place when you take him 
up tomorrow, and strongly recom- 
mend that he carry a communicator 
as well as a weapon; but unless I 
see something you haven’t men- 
tioned when I do go, I would say 
it was all right. 

Once more the Felodon reached 
the river, but this time it did not 
cross. It was no longer heading 
straight for the helicopter. Hills had 
not altered its course, but the cliffs 
had. They formed a wall on its right 
which was too nearly vertical for 
its agility and strength. Even this 
barrier, however, had caused no vis- 
ible hesitation or doubt. It had 
swerved, followed the base of the 
wall to the point where the river 
emerged and plunged in as prompt- 
ly as it had done before. Few am- 
phibians have ever lost the art of 
swimming when their larval gills 
vanished; the feeble current meant 
nothing to the Felodon. 

It turned upstream and went on 
its way. 

IV 

N domi Sulewayo had pursued 
his occupation on terraces of 
Earth’s Grand Canyon, on cliffsides 
of Fomalhaut Four’s highest range 
and in badlands on the dimly lighted 
Antares Twelve. The physical haz- 
ards of his present position troubled 
him little. McLaughlin had agreed 
that the ledge where the paleontol- 
ogist had been left was inaccessible 
to the larger carnivores, and had 
merely issued a final warning about 
the green world 


poisonous “lizards.” The primary 
danger, as nearly as Sulewayo could 
see, was that something might hap- 
pen to the helicopter. He certainly 
could not rejoin the others on foot. 
He was facing a sheer wall some 
sixty feet high. A score of yards be- 
hind him the terrace ended in an- 
other straight drop of several hun- 
dred feet. A quarter of a mile on 
either side, the flat surface ended; 
to the west, by narrowing until the 
two walls became one; at the other 
end, it was cut off as far as he was 
concerned by a joint penetrating ap- 
parently the full depth of the can- 
yon. 

There were several other cracks 
in the wall facing him. Like those 
in the tributary canyon explored by 
Krendall and Mitsuitei, these were 
packed with volcanic detritus. This 
was hard to reconcile with the sug- 
gestion that erosion had been long 
at work. In such a case, the higher 
portions should have washed away 
long before the material found at 
the canyon bottom. 

Examination at close range sug- 
gested a possible explanation. The 
tuff at this point was fairly well 
cemented. It seemed reasonable to 
suppose that the joints had been 
present before the mountains had 
started to rise; that a volcanic mud 
flow had filled them with detritus; 
that the new material had then been 
cemented by dissolved material 
coming from above. This would 
make the top levels of the tuff more 
resistant than those lower down, 
where the cementing minerals had 
not reached, and account for what 
had been seen so far. 

31 




Wm fyviw 


The hypothesis also implied a 
plentiful supply of fossils. Volcanic 
mud flowing into a crack in the 
ground should carry plenty with it. 
Sulewayo set to work with a ham- 
mer, and was presently soaking with 
perspiration. 

He was tempted to remove some 
of his clothing; but this had been 
treated chemically to repel Viridian 
insects and caution prevailed. Mc- 
Laughlin had not mentioned any 
dangerous biters or stingers, and in 
all probability his blood would not 
be to. the taste of any such crea- 
tures on this world — but if the 
mosquito or tick did not learn that 
fact until after it had tried, Sulewayo 
would hardly profit by it. In any 
case the temptation to strip passed 
quickly. In only a few minutes, his 
attention was fully occupied by his 


work; for the expected fossils proved 
to be present in very satisfactory 
numbers. 

Most seemed rather fragmentary. 
Apparently the original creatures 
had been tumbled about rather 
badly before the medium hardened. 
However, the remains were definite- 
ly bones, as he had expected and 
hoped. For some time Sulewayo was 
occupied alternately digging out 
more fragments and trying to fit 
the more hopeful-looking speci- 
mens together, although he had no 
success at the latter job. Then evi- 
dence of a more complete set of re- 
mains appeared, and he instantly 
slowed down to the incredibly me- 
ticulous procedure which marks a 
paleontologist anywhere in the uni- 
verse. 

At this time he had cut perhaps 


32 


IF 





a foot into the tuff for the full 
three-foot width of the crack and 
from terrace level up to about his 
own height. In spite of its apparent- 
ly firm texture, the rock was ex- 
tremely soft; and the old question 
about erosion was reappearing. Big 
pockets of extremely crumbly ma- 
terial had been responsible for most 
of his speed. Now, however, with 
the usual perversity of the inani- 
mate, a firmer substance was en- 
countered, apparently encasing the 
bones he suspected of existing a little 
farther on. This combined with his 
increased care to bring almost to a 
halt the removal of rock from the 
cleft. 

T he bones were there. Per- 
haps they had been betrayed 
by a discoloration of the rock too 
faint for him to have noticed con- 
sciously; perhaps something more 
subtle is involved in the makeup of 
a successful field worker in pale- 
ontology, but as flake after flake 
of the matrix fell away under his 
attack a shape gradually took form. 

At first a single bone which 
might have been an unusually short 
digit or an unusually long carpal — 
or, of course, something totally un- 
related to either — was outlined. 
Then another, close enough to sug- 
gest that their lifetime relationship 
might have been maintained. And 
another — Sulewayo failed to hear 
the approach of the helicopter un- 
til its rotor wash from a hundred 
feet above lifted the dust about his 
ankles. 

Knowing that Lampert would be 
having trouble holding that close to 

THE GREEN WORLD 


the cliffside, the paleontologist re- 
luctantly hooked his equipment to 
his belt and started up the ladder. 
Five minutes later they were back 
in the camp, with Krendall listening 
eagerly to Sulewayo’s description of 
his find. 

“It’s certainly a vertebrate, Hans. 
That stuff can’t possibly be shell or 
wood. It’s almost certainly* a land 
dweller — ” 

“Likely enough in that sort of 
rock, anyway.” 

“ — because I got enough uncov- 
ered to be nearly certain that it’s 
a foot. Certainly a limb that would 
not be needed by a swimmer.” 

“Like an ichthyosaur?” queried 
Lampert innocently. Sulewayo 
grinned. 

“Quite possibly. More likely one 
of our ubiquitous amphibids, though. 
Certainly something worth getting 
out, since the general idea is to get 
an evolutionary sequence of some 
sort.” 

“I suppose that means you’ll want 
me to date the eruption which filled 
all these cracks with detritus, then.” 

“Sure. But there’s no hurry. To- 
morrow will do.” Lampert found he 
had no answer to this, and Mitsuitei 
managed to edge into the discussion. 
He had spent the day with Mc- 
Laughlin, as he had hoped; and mere 
failure to find paving stones had not 
damped his ardor. 

“I suppose you and Hans will both 
want to go up the cliff tomorrow,” 
he remarked. “In that case, Rob 
might as well stay with String and 
me. It will speed up the digging 
back at my hill.” 

“Are you still scraping dirt off 

33 



that thing?” asked Sulewayo in mock 
■urprise. “Didn’t one day indicate 
that it was a joint pattern like the 
rest?” 

“Not yet. We haven’t gotten down 
to rock over any place where your 
cracks should be. The root tangle 
of the taller trees slows the digging. 
I admit the rock is limestone like 
the cliff, but there’s still no evidence 
why those trees grow so regularly.” 

“That’s just what we’ve been say- 
ing all along; but you keep looking 
for the remains of a city.” 

“I gathered, Ndomi, from your 
recent conversation that you were 
digging for a land animal on the 
basis of three bones. Either you are 
working on hunch, which destroys 
your right to criticize, or you are 
reasoning from knowledge not avail- 
able to the rest of us. In the latter 
case, you should be at least open- 
minded enough to credit me with 
equivalent knowledge in my own 
field.” 

It was Sulewayo’s turn to have 
nothing to say; he had honestly sup- 
posed that the archaeologist had 
been taking the “city” hypothesis no 
more seriously than the rest. He 
apologized at once, and peace was 
restored. Lampert sealed it by agree- 
ing to Mitsuitei’s suggestion. 

The rest of the evening was spent 
in detail planning by the two groups. 
At sunset, all turned in to sleep be- 
hind the protection of the electri- 
fied fence. Even the guide regarded 
this as an adequate safeguard. 

A pparently his opinion was shared 
by at least one other. The 
Felodon had spent most of the 

34 


day under water, part of the time 
in the canyon fairly close to Lamp- 
ert and Krendall and later down 
the stream by the site where the 
guide and archaeologist had been 
working. At neither place had it 
emerged, or shown the slightest sign 
of wanting to attack. McLaughlin’s 
reference to the strange instinct of 
the creatures seemed justified. It 
certainly could not see the men, but 
just as certainly was aware of their 
presence. 

What it was about the alien visi- 
tors which exercised such an influ- 
ence on the minute brain of the 
carnivore, no one could have said 
— then. Any watcher who had sup- 
posed, from its earlier actions, that 
it was moved by a desire for new 
and different taste sensations would 
have had to discard the notion now. 

With the men safely settled down 
behind their fence, the beast sud- 
denly turned back downstream. It 
had returned to the camp site at 
the end of the working day. In an 
hour it was in the jungle below the 
canyon; in another it had killed, and 
was feeding as it had the moment 
before the hum of the helicopter 
had first attracted its attention. This 
time it finished the meal in peace; 
and once finished, did not show 
immediate signs of its former ob- 
session. 

Instead it sought a lair and re- 
laxed, blending so perfectly into the 
undergrowth and remaining so silent 
that within a few minutes small ani- 
mals were passing only feet away 
from the concealed killer. 

Robin Lampert was only a fair 
statistician, but if he had been ac- 

IF 



quainted with the moves of that 
Felodon during the last few days, 
even he would have been willing to 
take oath that more than chance 
was involved. He would probably 
have wanted to dissect the animal 
in search of whatever mechanism 
was controlling it. 

But Robin Lampert knew nothing 
of the creature. Neither did Take- 
hiko Mitsuitei; and that was rather 
unfortunate, for the lair it had 
selected was on the same hill as the 
archaeologist’s digging site, and a 
scant quarter mile away from the 
pit Mitsuitei had left. 

T he rising of the green sun 
was not visible the next morn- 
ing. The ever-present mist had 
thickened into a solid layer of cloud, 
and hissing rain cut the visibility to 
a few hundred yards. The helicopter 
felt its way down to the hill with 
radar, landed on the river, taxied on 
its floats to the bank and was 
moored. Lampert, McLaughlin and 
Mitsuitei emerged, the scientists 
laden with apparatus, and started 
up the hill toward the site. The guide 
carried only his weapons. 

The equipment was not of the 
sort Mitsuitei was accustomed to 
using. It actually belonged to Lamp- 
ert. Normally it would not be used 
in an archaeological dig, any more 
than it would have been had they 
been fossil hunting; for neither ac- 
tivity takes kindly to any sort of 
automatic digging machinery. 
Lampert had suggested its use, how- 
ever, in order to get a rapid idea of 
the nature of the soil cover, bed 
rock and joint structure of the hill. 
THE GREEN WORLD 


If evidence warranted, it would be 
abandoned for the slower methods 
of digging. If not, a few hours would 
permit them to learn as much about 
the area as many days of work with 
slower equipment. 

The hole Mitsuitei had already 
dug was part way up the hill, in a 
space cleared of underbrush by a 
flamethrower. Several other such 
clearings were in the neighborhood. 
As the archaeologist had said, he 
had made more than one attempt 
at digging which had been frustrated 
by roots. 

Somewhat to Lampert’s surprise, 
it was possible to tell even from 
ground level the orientation of the 
taller trees which had been so prom- 
inent from the air. Even the smaller 
plants showed signs of some under- 
ground influence. Between the tall- 
est trees, tracing out the straight 
lines the men had seen from above, 
the underbrush formed an almost 
impenetrable wall. Elsewhere foot 
travel was easy, though the surface 
was by no means barren. Lampert 
understood how there might indeed 
have been difficulty in digging on 
one of the fertile lines, and admitted 
as much. 

“That’s the trouble,” responded 
Mitsuitei. “I’d like to get down right 
at such a point, to see what’s under- 
neath. It seems to me that paving 
might be responsible, if they’d used 
the right materials. Lots of civiliza- 
tions have used organic substances 
which decay to good fertilizer. Then 
there might be the remains of a 
sewage system, which would account 
for richer soil — ” 

“After the time which must have 

35 




passed since the place was buried?” 

“Tt has happened. In such a case, 
of course, trace elements rather 
than nitrates or phosphates are re- 
sponsible. That’s what I suspect 
here.” 

“But wouldn’t it be better to dig 
where you actually have — in the 
middle of a block, if that’s what it 


Saun 

Lampert nodded and proceeded 
to assemble his equipment. The 
“mole” was a cylinder about five 
centimeters in diameter and three 
times as long. A cutter-lined mouth 
occupied one end, while the other 
was attached to a snaky appendage 
which was wound on a fair sized 
drum. A set of controls knobs and 


is? Then you’d be fairly certain to 
hit a building, which should be rich- 
er ground than a street.” 

“Only if you actually strike arti- 
facts. The building itself might be 
much less well preserved than a 
paved street. However, you are the 
one who’s handling that mechanical 
mole. Dig where you want, and see 
what you can learn about this hill- 
top. Just get me at least a couple 
of cores from my ‘streets’ before 
you’re done, please.” 


indicators were mounted near the 
center of the drum. 

The geophysicist set the cylinder 
on the ground mouth downward, 
pushing it into the soft earth far 
enough to assure its remaining up- 
right. Then he turned to his con- 
trols and after a moment, with very 
little noise, the cylinder began to 
sink into the ground. In a few sec- 
onds it was out of sight, trailing its 
snaky neck after it. 

The men watched it in silence. 


36 


IF 


Perhaps thirty seconds after it dis- 
appeared, there was a minor con- 
vulsion in the neck, a momentarily 
rising hum from the machinery, and 
a plug of dirt about two centimeters 
in diameter and five long was 
ejected from a port in the center of 
the drum. This was seized by Lamp- 
ert and examined briefly, then 
tossed aside. “The soil is pretty 
deep,” he remarked. 

“How far down did that come 
from?” asked Mitsuitei. 

“One meter. That’s the sampling 
interval I’ve set in it, for now. If it 
meets anything much harder or 
easier to penetrate, it will warn me 
and I’ll grab them more frequently.” 
Conversation lapsed while two more 
samples arrived and were inspected. 
Then a light flickered on the panel, 
and Lampert reset one of his knobs; 
and almost immediately a core of 
light gray limestone was produced. 

“Apparently the same stuff as the 
cliffs,” said Lampert after examin- 
ing the specimen. “Do you want to 
go any deeper, or drill a few more 
holes to get an idea of the contour?” 
“How fast will that thing go 
through limestone?” 

“A couple of centimeters per 
minute. It’s too small to pack a real 
power unit.” 

“Give it five minutes, just to make 
sure it isn’t a building block.” 

“Ten centimeters wouldn’t give 
you a whole building block.” 

“A sample from that far inside 
one would tell me what I want to 
know. You rock-chippers don’t seem 
to think that archaeology is a science 
yet. Let me have that first core, 
too.” Mitsuitei looked confident to 

THE GREEN WORLD 


the point of being cocky, and Lamp- 
ert let the mole burrow on. The 
second core came in due time, and 
the little man set merrily to work 
with tiny chips from the two stone 
cylinders, a pinch of the lowest soil 
sample which had been acquired, 
a small comparison microscope and 
a kit full of tiny reagent bottles. 
Lampert used the time the tests 
consumed in reversing the mole and 
resetting the equipment on a new 
spot. By the time the little mechan- 
ism had gnawed its way once more 
to rock, Mitsuitei was forced to ad- 
mit that the formation appeared to 
be natural. 

He did not seem as disheartened 
by the discovery as might have been 
expected. He simply waited for 
more cores, his narrow face reflect- 
ing nothing but the utter absorption 
Lampert knew he experienced when- 
ever a problem arose in his line. 
In spite of his apparent tendency to 
jump to conclusions, Takehiko Mit- 
suitei was an experienced and re- 
spected member of his profession. 
Lampert knew enough about his 
record to be perfectly willing to ac- 
cept his instructions for the present. 

A series of holes was drilled, 
from the original position to- 
ward one of the “streets” forty yards 
away from it. After each the archae- 
ologist admitted with perfect cheer- 
fulness that there was nothing in- 
consistent with the idea that the hill 
was a perfectly natural formation. 
He still insisted, however, that the 
regular lines of trees, reinforced as 
they were by the undergrowth pat- 
tern, required explanation. 

37 



Lampert admitted this, but felt 
that he knew what the explanation 
would be. After all, volcanic residue 
is more than likely to contain the 
trace elements vegetation requires, 
even on Viridis. 

Finally the time came to get veri- 
fication — or the opposite. The 
flamethrower had to be used this 
time, and for several minutes clouds 
of steam swirled about the men as 
its blue-white tongue fought the 
sappy, rain-soaked undergrowth. 
Then the mole and its controls were 
wheeled into place, and the little 
robot once more nosed its way out 
of sight. 

“I don’t suppose you want any 
samples above the regular rock level, 
do you?” asked Lampert as the ma- 
chine disappeared. 

“I think it would be best if we 
took them as usual,” was the reply. 
“For one thing, we should try to 
learn the depth at which the soil 
composition changes — we are at 
least agreed that it changes in some 
manner, after all.” 

“True enough.” The geophysicist 
set his controls, and the process 
continued — a process familiar now 
to McLaughlin as well as the scien- 
tists, for the guide had caught nu- 
merous glimpses of what was going 
on while he -prowled about the work 
area on self-imposed guard duty. 

Mitsuitei took the crumbly soil 
cores as they came, examined them 
quickly — they were arriving every 
few seconds — and filed them in 
numbered compartments in a speci- 
men case he had opened. Detailed 
stratigraphy would come later For 
some time there was no gross evi- 

38 


dence of change in the soil; not, in 
fact, until his first case had been 
filled. 

“Can you stop that thing for a 
moment, Rob?” he asked at this 
point. “I don’t want to lose track 
of these, and will have to hold up 
while I open a new case.” 

“All right. I thought you’d want 
to stop for thought soon anyway.” 
“Why?” 

“Because the mole is nearly four 
meters down, well below the depth 
at which we hit bedrock before, and 
is still in soil.” 

“Eh? But — but it’s still ordinary 
soil; none of your volcanic ash.” 
“Tuff had been eroded out of a 
lot of the joints in the cliffs. There’s 
no reason to expect it to be at the 
same level as the surrounding rock.” 
“That’s true.” Mitsuitei paused in 
thought for a moment. “If we keep 
on going straight down, we may 
just be working into a natural crack, 
as you say Might it not be better 
to drill several holes within a few 
square yards here, to determine 
whether it is a narrow joint such 
as you expect or an actual edge to 
the rock at this level?” 

“Maybe the edge of a roof, eh?” 
Lampert chuckled, but spoke in a 
manner which could give no offense. 
“I can do better than that. Don’t 
need to pull up and start over; 
simply drill horizontally from where 
we are now. Shouldn’t take long to 
get dimensions, if that’s all you 
want.” He halted the robot momen- 
tarily, and from a compartment in 
the drum removed something like 
a small theodolite mounting. This 
he set up on a short tripod over the 

IF 



point where the neck of the mole 
emerged from the ground, and set 
a pointer at right angles to the line 
of tall trees. Then he started the 
digging again. 

V 

F our starts in as many differ- 
ent directions and twenty 
minutes of time showed fairly con- 
clusively that the line of vegetation 
which had given rise to the “street” 
theory was growing along a straight 
crack, apparently a fairly ordinary 
joint, in the limestone. While several 
more holes would have to be drilled 
to prove it, even Mitsuitei was will- 
ing to admit that in all probability 
the remaining lines would be found 
to be over similar cracks. 

“You must admit, though, that 
the regularity of this joint pattern 
is pretty unusual,” the archaeologist 
said at length. 

“It’s far from being unknown,” 
Lampert replied. “I got my first 
large taste of it in my student days 
back on Earth. Fly over the mesa 
country in southwestern North 
America sometime. Most of the 
joints there are invisible from a dis- 
tance, of course; but at the edge of 
a butte where weathering is most 
prominent the blocks have frequent- 
ly started to separate, and the thing 
looks as though it had been put to- 
gether from outsize bricks.” 

“Hmph. Seem to remember some- 
thing of the sort myself, now that 
you mention it. I did some digging 
in that area, too. I shouldn’t have 
connected that sort of country with 
what we have here, though.” 

THE GREEN WORLD 


“Different meat; same skeleton,” 
replied Lampert. 

“But how about this volcanic ash, 
or mud, or whatever it is, which at 
least fills the joints we saw in the 
cliff? That’s not so usual, is it?” 
“Not in my experience. But grant- 
ing the joints and the volcanoes, 
there’s nothing really surprising 
about it. Incidentally, we don’t know 
that this crack we’re standing on 
has the same filling. We’d better 
bore down again to make sure. At 
least we may get some idea of the 
date of the volcanic action com- 
pared to that of the orogeny that 
tilted the block where we’re camped. 
If there’s tuff down here too, it will 
substantiate the idea that the vul- 
canism is the older.” 

“Why? Couldn’t ash have settled 
down here as well as up there at 
substantially the same time?” 

“It could. But I’d bet a fairly 
respectable sum that the tuff we 
saw in the canyon was from a mud 
flow, not a fall of airborne ash. 
That could hardly have reached the 
top of the cliffs — actually, the op- 
posite slope of the mountains, where 
Sulewayo is working — and this 
area simultaneously.” 

“Maybe from different eruptions? 
I get the impression that this world 
has a slight tendency to produce 
volcanic fields rather than individ- 
ual cones or flows.” 

“Might be. Chemistry will prob- 
ably settle that question.” During 
the latter part of this discussion 
Lampert had directed the mole once 
more downwards, and every half 
meter of travel another core was 
added to the collection. At six and 

39 



a half meters below the soil the 
first solid specimen arrived; the 
others had been held together only 
by roots. This one, however, caused 
the two scientists to look at each 
other. Lampert nodded slowly, with 
a smile. Mitsuitei gave a shrug, and 
let an expression of resignation play 
over his usually impassive features. 

The core was tuff, apparently 
identical with that in the cliffs to 
the east. It even contained fossils. 

CCT guess this whole dig might 
1 as well be taken over by the 
paleontology department,” Lampert 
commented finally. “I suppose 
they’ll at least want to compare fos- 
sils in the tilted and level strata.” 
“I suppose so.” Mitsuitei was turn- 
ing the little cylinder over and over 
in his hand. “Tell me, Rob. what’s 
this little speck of green?” 

“Copper salts of one sort or an- 
other, I suppose.” Lampert was not 
greatly interested. “A lot of second- 
ary minerals form in and under vol- 
canic detritus. On this world, car- 
bonates like malachite should form 
quite readily.” 

“Why should it form in a regular 
thread like this?” 

“You mean a vein? Hard to tell 
precisely. Varying rates of water 
seepage, varying degrees of oxygen 
or carbon dfoxide penetration, vary- 
ing degrees of compactness in the 
rock where the stuff is formed — ” 
“I don’t mean a vein. This is in a 
cylindrical body going right through 
the core from one side to the other, 
as though there had been a copper 
wire there originally which had been 
attacked by soil acids.” 

40 


“Let’s see. You’re right. It’s hardly 
an ordinary vein, though your sug- 
gestion seems a trifle far fetched. 
The paleontologists can probably 
furnish an idea. Maybe a vine or 
even a worm buried in the mud flow 
acted as the precipitating agent for 
copper salts in the subsequent seep- 
age — I’ve seen beautiful fossils of 
pyrite which had been formed that 
way.” 

“But this shows no trace of struc- 
ture, except for its exterior shape.” 
“Isn’t a really well preserved 
structure the exception rather than 
the rule in fossils?” 

“I suppose so. Still, I’d like to 
know just how far, and which way, 
this green thread goes. I’d also like 
to know whether there are dilute 
copper deposits spread through this 
rock, which could be concentrated 
in the way you suggest.” 

“The first could be learned by 
taking enough cores. The other 
would call for some very careful 
analysis of samples which had been 
selected with a very sedulous eye 
kept on the stratigraphy. You know 
that; you must have done that sort 
of thing looking for carbon-four- 
teen samples, at times.” 

“Yes, I see that. Could you make 
such analyses here?” 

“No, except for the mere presence 
of copper. The cores would have to 
go back to a well equipped lab. Still, 
if you want to get them, it’s all 
right with me. Problems were made 
to be solved. I’ll admit this one 
doesn’t seem very exciting to me, 
but I can use your data after you 
finish for work of my own. You 
should wind up with material for a 

IP 



pretty complete geochemical picture 
of this neighborhood. Shall I get the 
cores for you?” 

“Yes, please.” 

“Silly question. All right.” The 
mole was drawn up a short distance, 
and sent questing downward once 
more at an angle to the original 
shaft, branching off a short distance 
above the level from which the cop- 
per deposit had come. Again and 
again the process was repeated, 
each time at a slightly different bear- 
ing from the central hole; and Mit- 
suitei examined each core for traces 
of green. At last he found it, pierc- 
ing the little cylinder of rock as the 
other had done; and then, at his sug- 
gestion, Lampert reset the mole to 
get a sample in the opposite direc- 
tion from the one which had fur- 
nished the new specimen. 

T his also checked positive; and 
four more samples, taken along 
the same line at various distances, 
all did the same. 

Apparently the line of green ex- 
tended for some distance, about 
parallel both to the surface of the 
ground and the trend of the joint in 
which it was buried. Mitsuitei was 
radiant. 

“I’m going down to that level if 
I have to come back with an ex- 
pedition of my own! If that’s a fossil 
worm, it’s worth getting the whole 
length anyway — but I don’t believe 
it is. I—” 

“That will take a lot of time, you 
know,” Lampert pointed out mildly. 

“Certainly I know! Even if I use 
your fast excavator down to the 
tuff level, I’ll have to do detail work 
THE GREEN WORLD 


from then on. What of it?” 

“Well, the others may have jobs 
they want to do — ” 

“Then they can do them! What 
are we here for, anyway? I thought 
it was to investigate the past of this 
planet! Ndomi and Hans -are doing 
that their own way right now. Why 
can’t I? I’m an archaeologist, and 
I came along to do any archaeologi- 
cal work that presented itself to do; 
this is the only thing of the sort 
anyone’s seen so far. I know what 
you’re thinking. Maybe you’re partly 
right. I certainly won’t bet any 
money that this thread of green is 
a fossil telephone wire; but it’s as 
likely to be that as anything else 
you’ve suggested, and I’m going 
down to that level and sift the whole 
volume. Hans and Ndomi can have 
any fossils I find if that will make 
you happier — and if one of them 
says he has no use for fossils he 
didn’t dig himself. I’ll make him eat 
his words. I can identify, locate and 
report on anything that turns up in 
a rock as well as any of those jig- 
saw-puzzle people; and I can do it 
in mud, too, which is more than any 
of them could manage.” 

“Don’t get hot under the collar. 
If you can help it on this planet. 
You sound as though one of the 
boys had been giving you a lecture 
on the importance of knowing what 
strata a given series of specimens 
represent.” 

“Not one of our boys — they 
have a little more sense. But there 
was a young paleontologist when I 
was covering the Antares worlds 
whose memory still makes my blood 
pressure go up. Never mind me; 

41 



that’s not important. But I want to 
make this dig.” 

“It will tie up machines, however 
freely we can spare time,” Lampert 
said slowly. “I’ll tell you: how about 
this? We spend the rest of the day 
getting cores from other points 
along these cracks. For one thing, 
we ought to ^know more about the 
structure of the hill, and for an- 
other, we might find more of your 
‘wires.* After all, the chance of our 
hitting the only one around is pretty 
remote. I can’t quite see a single 
dropped piece of copper wire show- 
ing up in the first two days of a 
project like this.” 

“I neither said nor implied that 
this should be the only piece. I don’t 
doubt for a moment that there are 
others, whether they are wires or 
worms.” 

“Sorry. Well, we take these cores 
back to camp this evening, together 
with any others we find of the same 
sort, and let Hans and Ndomi look 
them over. If they don’t turn out 
to be something that the boys rec- 
ognize and can classify right off the 
bat, we come back tomorrow with 
all the digging machinery you want, 
and dig until you either find all you 
want, satisfy yourself that there’s 
nothing here or find something 
which obviously requires more spe- 
cialized attention than we can give 
it. All right?” 

“Nothing could be fairer. Let’s 
go!” 

T he discussion in camp that eve- 
ning was animated beyond 
anything the guide had heard. His 
original estimate of these men as 

42 


relatively quiet specimens under- 
went a sharp revision. Mitsuitei’s re- 
port of the day’s activity at his site 
had, it is true, been delivered quite 
calmly; but from then on matters 
grew progressively livelier. This was 
not caused by opposition to the 
archaeologist’s plans. The others 
were all in favor of remaining, for 
their own reasons. However, the 
question of just what was likely to 
be found gave rise to much rather 
barbed comment on Sulewayo’s part. 
“I don’t see how you can expect 
to find any trace of civilized work 
here,” he said flatly at one point. 
“The animal and plant life of this 
planet is at a stage of evolution 
corresponding to something like 
Earth’s Pennsylvanian age, when 
the amphibians were the highest 
known forms of life. I’m not saying 
that there couldn’t be such a thing 
as an intelligent amphibian. But I 
do say that the normal set of evolu- 
tionary forces which, on both Earth 
and Viridis, produced creatures of 
the amphibian pattern could have 
done that or produced an intelligent 
fish; not both. If the latter ever 
evolved, it failed; for the amphib- 
ians — pardon me, amphibids — 
are here. To get an intelligent am- 
phibid on this world will — or 
would, if the sun were to last long 
enough — require another orogenic 
period with the accompanying cli- 
matic changes. Then you’d stand a 
considerably higher chance of get- 
ting reptiles instead, if the compara- 
tive work done on over four hun- 
dred planets carries any meaning.” 
“I don’t doubt the value of the 
work at all. You are very probably 

IF 



correct. It did not occur to me to 
expect remains of intelligent am- 
phibians. I saw no reason to pre- 
suppose that anything in the way of 
artifacts which I might find would 
necessarily be native to this planet.” 

“You think there were other visi- 
tors from outside the Beta Librae 
system?” 

“The possibility certainly exists. 
Here we are.” 

“But for Pete’s sake! Do you really 
expect that they stayed long enough 
to build a city, or do you think you 
have the remains of a camp like 
ours, or what?” 

“I don’t think anything. It has 
been suggested that such people did 
come, and stayed long enough to — ” 

“And you think you’ve found 
them.” 

“I think nothing, except that I 
have found, with Rob’s help, some- 
thing which neither his professional 
knowledge, nor mine, nor even 
yours, is able to explain; and I think 
an explanation is desirable. I hope 
you won’t consider me discourteous 
for pointing out that each time you 
have tried to accuse me of jumping 
to conclusions, you have been able 
to do so only by jumping to some 
yourself. I might further add that 
the suggestion that this planet had 
been stocked with its present supply 
of life types by visitors from space 
was advanced by a paleontologist, 
not by one of my colleagues. I gath- 
er he could not understand how life 
could evolve to the state it shows 
in the thirty-odd million years that 
the planet seems to have been solid. 
I neither support nor deride the 
idea; I simply want to gather data, 
THE GREEN WORLD 


in an attempt to explain a much 
simpler question — why are narrow 
threads of copper compounds to be 
found every few feet in the volcanic 
tuff filling the joints in a certain 
limestone hill, and why are those 
threads always nearly horizontal? 
You and Hans say they are not or- 
ganic fossils, and I accept your con- 
clusion. Rob says that there is no 
copper in that rock, detectable with 
his equipment, except within a few 
millimeters of the green threads. I 
say nothing except that I have never 
seen such a thing before. Under the 
circumstances, I fail to understand 
where you get the idea that I think 
there is a city built by the people 
who stocked this world thirty mil- 
lion years ago buried under that hill. 
I know I said ‘city’ when I first saw 
it, and I still think I was justified in 
the opinion; I have now seen evi- 
dence which causes me to admit 
that the vegetation pattern was not 
caused by artificial structures, and 
I dismiss the original hypothesis. I 
still want to dig there, and in ac- 
cordance with Rob’s agreement I 
am going to dig there, with the as- 
sistance of anyone who chooses to 
help. I know you want to go back 
to your set of leg bones in the cliff, 
and have no objection to your do- 
ing so. Even I can now see, on the 
basis of your description, that you 
are uncovering the fossil of a land 
animal; and I agree that it is of 
great importance to get it out in- 
tact, if possible. But if 1 can see the 
importance and even the nature of 
your work, why can’t you do the 
same for mine?” The little man was 
leaning forward and staring intense- 

43 



ly into Sulewayo’s face by the time 
he finished this harangue, and 
Ndomi once more felt a trifle 
ashamed of himself. Lampert, how- 
ever, saved him the need of formu- 
lating an apology. 

CCT’m sure Ndomi didn’t mean 
A to ridicule your work in any 
way, Take,” he said. “We all realize 
perfectly that an underground phe- 
nomenon which cannot be explained 
at sight either by geology, paleon- 
tology or archaeology is something 
which requires investigation. T im- 
agine that the best plan will be for 
String and me to go with you to- 
morrow, while the others continue 
their stone-cutting. Hans, just how 
far along are you, anyway?” 

The older paleontologist thought 
for a moment. 

“We don’t really know,” he said 
at last. “Of course, we aren’t trying 
to get the individual bones com- 
pletely free of the matrix; that will 
take somebody months or years. 
We’re uncovering just enough to 
determine the extent of the speci- 
men, so we can take it all out in one 
block — or more, of course, if it’s 
too big. So far we can only guess 
at how big it is. We’ve uncovered 
with certainty two feet, and gone 
about h^ilf a meter along one of 
the attached legs. They seem to be 
extending straight back into the cliff, 
so in effect we’re cutting a tunnel 
beside the thing. Assuming it had 
two main leg sections, as most of 
the present animals on both Earth 
and Viridis appear to have, we’re 
about halfway between knee and 
hip joint. Of course, it might turn 
44 


out to be the Viridian equivalent of 
a horse or chicken. In that case, 
we’re about half way between ankle 
and knee. We certainly have sev- 
eral feet yet to penetrate before we 
can outline the whole block, assum- 
ing that the specimen is essentially 
complete. Several days, I would 
guess.” 

“Can you use any sort of power 
apparatus for any of your cuts?” 

“I don’t like to, on general prin- 
ciples, but — yes, we could, with ac- 
tually very little risk. If you have 
some sort of rock saw whose cutting 
part can get fine control, I’d be 
willing to use it for parts of the 
tunnel away from the actual speci- 
men.” 

“I have. We’ll take you up there 
first thing in the morning, and I’ll 
go down with you and show you 
how to use it before going on with 
Take and String.” 

“Who holds the ’copter in place 
while you climb down the ladder, 
give your lesson and come back?” 
asked the guide. 

“Hmph. I forgot about that. All 
right, I’ll break out the machinery 
and give the lesson right now.” He 
got up and strode to the helicopter. 
McLaughlin covered him from the 
fence to the aircraft, but nothing 
dangerous appeared. The geophysi- 
cist disappeared inside, and returned 
a moment later with a compact 
metal case under his arm. The guide 
holstered his weapon as the gate in 
the fence closed once more. 

Actually, the Felodon was miles 
downstream. It had spent the day 
in its chosen lair, apparently indif- 
ferent to the doings of the men a 

IF 



few hundred yards away. With the 
coming of darkness — real darkness 
this time, for the rain clouds cut off 
both the moonlight and the night 
glow from the upper atmosphere — 
it had emerged, hunted, killed and 
fed as before, apparently unham- 
pered by the lack of light. By mid- 
night it was back in the same lair, 
paunch distended, as close to sleep 
as its coldblooded kind ever came. 

VI 

T he rain was still falling when 
the clouds lightened once 
more to the rising sun. Lam pert was 
getting used to navigating the can- 
yon by radar, and was an excellent 
pilot anyway; so he did not have 
too much trouble in locating the 
shelf where Sulewayo and Krendall 
had been working. Getting the men 
down to it was not particularly dif- 
ficult, though rather nerve-racking. 
Krendall went first, unburdened ex- 
cept for his personal equipment. 
Then he steadied the ladder for 
Sulewayo who had the cutter 
strapped across his shoulders. The 
steadying hand was needed. Climb- 
ing down a rope ladder when loaded 
“top-heavy” can be an extremely 
awkward bit of activity. Had the 
pilot above been any less capable, 
it would probably have been im- 
possible. 

The ledge was wet, but fortunate- 
ly not particularly slippery. The men 
set their equipment on the ground 
at the point where their cut entered 
the crack in the cliff, and without 
delay set to work. The tunnel was 
deep enough now to shelter the one 

THE GREEN WORLD 


actually cutting from the rain, so at 
first they took turns at this opera- 
tion. 

The cutting machine Lampert had 
provided was a sort of diamond- 
toothed chain saw capable of a two- 
meter extension. Ordinarily it was 
not the sort of thing a paleontologist 
would consider using so close to a 
specimen; but the men .were fairly 
sure by now of the general extent of 
the thing they were uncovering. 
Even so, they used the saw only on 
the side of their tunnel away from 
the visible remains. They speedily 
widened the passage enough to per- 
mit them both to get inside and 
work on the face of the exposed 
material; but they still used hand 
tools whenever there was any sus- 
picion that a bone might be about 
to appear. Work proceeded several 
times as fast as it had the day 
before. 

They tried cutting another tunnel 
on the opposite side of the fossil, 
but this proved rather awkward. 
The creature was close to this side 
of the crack, and they had to cut 
limestone as well as the softer tuff. 
The saw proved capable of handling 
this — it would have handled granite 
without trouble — but went a little 
more slowly. Eventually, however, 
the two men were working on op- 
posite sides of the fossil, each in a 
tunnel extending some two meters 
into the cliff face. 

Half a day’s work uncovered the 
leg bones sufficiently to show that 
Krendall’s first idea had been right. 
There were only the two major 
joints, each a trifle shorter than the 
corresponding parts of the human 

45 



skeleton. The lower leg was single 
rather than double, however; knee 
and ankle both consisted of ball- 
and-socket joints; and with this fact 
determined the men paused for 
thought. 

“Now why,” mused Krendall 
aloud, “should any sort of creature 
need that articulation?” 

“Could that foot be a hand in- 
stead?” asked Sulewayo. 

Of course, questions like that 
should have awaited the results of 
detailed examination in a labora- 
tory. Equally of course, the two men 
proceeded to clear one of the “feet” 
a little more thoroughly in order to 
find out for themselves. The answer 
was not helpful, though. 

“He might have picked up a twig 
with it, but he couldn’t have held 
it any more tightly than I can in 
my toes,” was Krendall’s verdict. 
“It’s a bigger and flatter foot than 
ours. But it’s a foot — nothing 
more.” 

“Maybe a swimming organ on the 
side?” suggested Sulewayo cautious- 

iy 

“Seems doubtful. If that joint 
evolved for such a purpose, I should 
think there’d be a corresponding 
modification in the foot bones, too 
— say a flattening such as you see 
in the paddles of some of the Meso- 
zoic sea reptiles of Earth.” 

“Reasonable.” 

“But not necessarily right. That 
I admit. Anything else strike you?” 

“Yes, though it makes the joints 
still more unbelievable.” 

“What?” 

“The foot itself Unless some rath- 
er remarkable distortion has oc- 

46 


curred, it had both longitudinal and 
transverse arches, like yours and 
mine — which suggests strongly that 
this thing’s ancestors had been walk- 
ing erect on two legs for some hun- 
dreds of thousands of generations.” 
Krendall raised his eyebrows at this, 
and silently examined the bony 
structure before them for several 
minutes. 

“I — hadn’t — spotted — that,” 
he said slowly. He looked in silence 
for several more seconds. Then the 
two men, moved by a single thought, 
went to the other end of the exposed 
leg and began to clear the hip joint 
and pelvic region. They worked al- 
most in silence, understanding each 
other perfectly, like an experienced 
surgical team; and gradually the 
equivalent of a pelvic girdle and 
lower end of a spinal column were 
cleared sufficiently to show their 
general nature. 

It was at this point that the heli- 
copter returned; but neither man 
noticed the fact until McLaughlin 
had called several times from the 
open ladder hatch. They climbed 
silently and thoughtfully up to the 
flyer; but Mitsuitei’s first question 
started the talk flowing. 

It did not end for a long, long 
time. 

K rendall, with difficulty, held in- 
terruptions of his more volatile 
companion. 

“There can be only the slightest 
doubt that this thing we’re uncover- 
ing walked erect on two legs,” he 
reported. “The feet; the way the 
pelvis is modified to support inter- 
nal organs; the fusing of the lowest 

IF

vertebrae with the pelvic girdle to 
form a weight carrying foundation 
— they all point the same way. The 
only thing hard to understand is the 
knee and ankle joints. If we had 
them, it would be virtually impos- 
sible for us to hold our legs rigid. 
Perhaps some really remarkable 
musculature — ” 

“Or a cartilage structure which 
has not been preserved,” cut in Sule- 
wayo. 

“Or some such thing as that, 
would explain it. I don’t know. The 
creature is good for several Ph.D. 
theses just as it lies — and probably 
an equal number of nervous col- 
lapses when we get it out.” 

“I find myself strongly desirous 
of seeing its skull,” remarked Lamp- 
ert. Sulewayo glanced at him sharp- 
ly. 

“You, too?” asked the young pale- 
ontologist. “I was hoping I was the 
only one crazy enough to have 
thought of that.” Mitsuitei smiled 
openly, an almost unheard-of act 
for him. He said nothing for a mo- 
ment, but everyone saw him; and 
even McLaughlin understood the 
thought. After a sufficiently long 
pause, he asked a question. 

“Have you uncovered enough of 
this creature’s structure to guess at 
any evolutionary connection — or 
lack of it — with the amphibids we 
already know on this world?” 

“I’d hate to take any oaths,” re- 
plied Krendall. “The legs, which 
we’ve seen most of, are different 
in detail; but they at least corre- 
spond in general with what we find 
here. The only really significant 
point there would be the single shin- 
48 


bone. In that it resembles Viridian 
land life in general — these animals 
don’t have the separate tibia and 
fibula characteristic of the usual run 
of Earthly land vertebrates. It real- 
ly proves nothing about what we’re 
all thinking, of course.” 

“I am tempted to work with you 
gentlemen tomorrow,” muttered the 
archaeologist. 

“Why? Didn’t your investigation 
pan out?” 

“It is harder for me to say than 
for you, so far. To dig a pit, big 
enough not only to work in but to 
cover a useful amount of ground, 
in a driving rain, is quite a job even 
with Rob’s machines — which I 
would never use were I not sure 
that there is nothing of importance 
above the limestone level. I have 
gotten down to the rock over an 
area three meters square, which is 
very good going; but I shall un- 
doubtedly find the pit full of water 
tomorrow, as we have not yet im- 
provised a really satisfactory drain- 
age system. I cannot — or at least 
will not — use machines inside the 
crack in the limestone; so it will be 
some time before I get down to our 
mysterious green threads.” 

“Then it would seem that the best 
we can do is go on as we have,” 
said Lampert. “The only change 
might be if one more man were to 
help at Take’s dig. But I don’t sup- 
pose either Hans or Ndomi would 
care to leave his own job at the mo- 
ment, and actually there’s not much 
more to do at the hill which can be 
done by anyone but Take himself. 
I’ll continue to help him as long as 
it’s a question of moving mud, but 

IF 



after that he’ll have to do his own 
sifting. String is automatically on 
guard duty at the hill, so there’s not 
much change we can make. Though 
I must say I haven’t seen anything 
dangerous yet, in that jungle.” 

“Those animals are like crows,” 
remarked the guide. “We used to 
have ’em on the farm, back on 
Earth. They’d be all over a freshly 
planted field, while no one was 
around. Come out yelling — they 
don’t move; come out with a gun, 
and they’re gone — unless you’d 
happened to forget to load it; then 
they sat and laughed at you. If 
you’re suggesting, Doctor, that I 
should relax the guard duty and lend 
a hand with digging, I veto the idea 
— and not because I’m afraid of 
getting my hands dirty.” 

C C T won’t say I didn’t have 

A some such thought, but I ac- 
cept your ruling ” smiled Lampert. 
There was silence for a moment; 
then Krendall reverted to the earlier 
subject. 

“You know,” he said, “if this thing 
we’ve found does turn out to have 
been intelligent, it will hardly solve 
any of the existing problems about 
Viridis.” ' 

“Why not?” asked Sulewayo in 
some surprise. 

“We still won’t know whether it’s 
native to the planet or not, unless we 
can establish a relatively complete 
evolutionary sequence leading to this 
form. If we do that, the question of 
speed of evolution here gets worse 
than ever; if we don’t no one will 
be sure whether or not we ought to 
look for buried spaceports or send 

THE GREEN WORLD 


out expeditions to find the planet 
they might have come from.” 

“The latter would be something 
of a waste of time,” remarked Mc- 
Laughlin. “Hunting one planet in the 
galaxy is like hunting one log of 
wood on Viridis.” No one contra- 
dicted this. All had seen the galactic 
star clouds from outside planetary 
atmosphere. 

“It seems to me, speaking as an 
amateur in your fields, gentlemen,” 
said Mitsuitei, “that the mere dis- 
covery of an intelligent creature in 
the Viridian fossil deposits would, 
on the basis of our present knowl- 
edge of the mechanisms of evolu- 
tion, strongly support the idea that 
this world was stocked from others. 
I realize that our knowledge may 
not be sufficient to justify us in that 
conclusion. But it is certainly not 
great enough to justify any other.” 
“You seem to have something 
there, Take,” admitted Krendall. “If 
this thing does turn out to have 
room for a brain in its skull, I sup- 
pose the next ten conventions of the 
Interstellar Archaeological Society, 
or whatever you call it, will be meet- 
ing at Emeraude.” 

“I shouldn’t be at all surprised. So 
far, my profession and yours have 
not overlapped, due to a consider- 
able factor of difference in the time 
spans covered. But it is just possible 
that we would be holding joint meet- 
ings, in the event you describe.” 

“This meeting is changing from 
discussion to speculation,” Lampert 
said drily. “I would be the last to 
decry the value of imagination; but 
actually we are as likely to face the 
need for entirely new hypotheses as 

49 



the result of our work here, as to 
find support for any now in exist- 
ence. I can speculate with the best 
of you, but for goodness sake let’s 
not take any speculation too serious- 
ly. I don’t really believe that some 
big-headed descendants of Ndomi’s 
fossil are listening in on me right 
now!” 

Even Sulewayo admitted that this 
was rather unlikely, and the con- 
versation turned to other matters 
until darkness fell. 

No one had trouble sleeping. The 
loud drumming of the rain on the 
metal roof meant nothing to field 
workers with their experience. If 
anything, the sound was soothing, 
giving a perpetual reminder that 
there was a roof. Such protection is 
not always available, in that line of 
work. 

The Felodon seemed to have lost 
its traveling propensity. Once more 
it went out into the utter darkness 
solely to get a meal. It accomplished 
this as quickly as ever, though its 
eyes must have been useless and the 
hiss and rumble of falling water 
drowned and buried any sounds 
which would have been useful in 
tracking. Back in the same lair, full- 
fed, it drowsed once more. 

VII 

* 

M itsuitei had been almost right 
in his prediction that the pit 
would be full of water. Only the 
fact that the land sloped a trifle — 
they were not right on top of the 
little hill — had saved it. As it was, 
several feet of water were in the 
bottom, and a good deal of mud had 
50 


washed in from the two sides facing 
the edges of the crack. The other 
two, much better braced by deep- 
reaching roots, had held firm. 

After some thought, Lampert 
used the little robot again. He 
started it at the bottom of the pit on 
the downhill side and drove almost 
horizontally toward the river. The 
two hundred meters of “neck” per- 
mitted the mole to emerge from the 
slope farther down. When it was 
withdrawn, a small ‘drain hole was 
obtained. Several more of these 
were drilled, and the pit lost its 
water fairly rapidly. 

There was still the problem of 
getting into the crack itself, which 
of course would involve digging be- 
low the level of the drain holes. 
Lampert, using the same excavator 
which had made the pit itself, final- 
ly provided a fair solution by digging 
a set of ditches around the larger 
hole; and since the opening itself 
was quite well protected by over- 
hanging trees, Mitsuitei had only 
drainage from the surrounding soil 
to contend with. 

Two hours after arriving, there- 
fore. he had a relatively clear work- 
ing space. The bottom of the pit 
was limestone, exposed by the com- 
plete removal of the overlying soil, 
some three meters square. Across 
it ran the crack, a trifle less than a 
meter wide, still packed with dirt. 
Everything was muddy — limestone, 
projecting roots, and Mitsuitei him- 
self. A slender log with branches cut 
to ten-centimeter stubs leaned 
against one corner, forming a rough 
ladder and giving entrance and 
egress to and from the site. 


IF 



The machinery which had done 
the original digging was at one side. 
Mitsuitei did not expect to need it 
again. He was now equipped with a 
hand shovel, and seemed about to 
use it. Lampert, standing at the edge 
of the pit, felt the incongruity, but 
managed not to laugh. 

“Are you sure there’s nothing I 
can do down there with you?” he 
asked. 

“I’m afraid not. From now on I 
want every bit of dirt to pass under 
my own eyes.” 

“Are you going to try to throw 
it all up here as you finish?” 

“No. That’s the purpose of the 
extra pit area down here. I can get 
a long way down the joint, simply 
heaping the material on the rock. 
It’s damp enough to pile quite steep- 
ly, too.” 

“How far down do you think you 
can get? The crack’s rather narrow 
to work in, and you have three and 
a half meters to go before you hit 
tuff. That’s going to be rough shov- 
eling. I still think you could use the 
machine safely for a little way fur- 
ther, at least.” 

“No doubt I could, but I’m not 
going to. There’s one thing I might 
use, though.' If you have another of 
those saws, such as the bonemen 
are using up on the cliff, I could 
widen this crack as I go — cut steps, 
in fact, to help get the mud up to 
this level when I’m further down.” 

“That’s a good thought, but I don’t 
have any other. If you really get 
far enough down to need it, though, 
I could fly up to get it. They were 
going to shift over to hand labor 
anyway.” 

THE GREEN WORLD 


“All right. Of course, it will be 
some time before I get that deep 
anyway; maybe I won’t need it to- 
day.” He bent to his work. 

“But what do I do?” asked Lamp- 
ert. “I can’t go off to attend to my 
own projects, because String has to 
stay here to guard you. I can’t get to 
the site where the others are work- 
ing because I can’t land there. I 
can’t sit in the helicopter and twiddle 
my thumbs because I’ll go crazy be- 
fore the day is over.” Mitsuitei 
straightened once more, and thought 
briefly. 

“Is there nothing in the geophysi- 
cal line you could do within sight ol 
this pit?” he asked finally. “The saw 
and digging machine are not the 
only apparatus you brought.” 

“That’s true. I brought some seis- 
mic gear, though I didn’t plan to use 
it quite like this. I might map the 
formations under this hill. The in- 
formation will be usable, I should 
think, and the joints will give quite 
a calibrating job. It will keep me 
busy, anyway.” 

“Just a minute!” Mitsuitei looked 
a trifle perturbed. “Does that mean 
you’re going to set off explosives 
around here? I want the sides of 
this pit held up by something better 
than roots, if you do.” 

L ampert chuckled. “No explo- 
sives,” he said “This is a nice 
little gadget with a robot like the 
core sampler. It puts out waves of 
any type desired from any depth 
down to two hundred fifty meters 
— a sort of subterranean sonar. 
You’ll never know it’s working. The 
wave amplitude isn’t enough to 

51 



feel.” He turned toward the helicop- 
ter on the river bank below, and was 
starting to walk toward it when Mc- 
Laughlin interrupted. The guide 
had heard the conversation, and his 
question was purely rhetorical. 

“You weren’t planning to walk 
down to the flyer alone, were you, 
Doctor?” 

“Well, yes, as a matter of fact. 
After all, I won’t be working; I can 
keep my eyes open as I go. You can 
see me for the greater part of the 
journey from here, too.” 

Rather to his surprise the guide 
approved this argument, after a mo- 
ment’s thought. 

“All right. But please keep your 
gun in your hand as well as your 
head on a swivel. I’d prefer to have 
Dr. Mitsuitei come down with us so 
we could stay together, but I know 
how he’d react to the interruption, 
and I realize you’re not a kid. Just 
be careful.” 

Lampert promised; and the 
guide’s manner had impressed him 
to the point where he was almost 
afraid to make the return journey, 
after reaching the flyer and packing 
his new equipment. He was rather 
surprised to get back to the site 
without being attacked, and Mc- 
Laughlin’s very evident relief at see- 
ing him did nothing to ease his 
feelings. 

He^began to set up the machinery. 
This consisted of an assembly very 
similar to the drilling mole — a 
small delving robot drawing a slen- 
der tail behind it, the tail wound on 
a drum which surrounded the con- 
trol unit. A dozen smaller cylinders 
reposed in attached clips. 

52 


“The attached borer,” Lampert 
explained to the guide, “goes down 
to any depth I set, up to two hun- 
dred fifty meters. It can produce 
any of the three normal types of 
earthquake wave, singly or in any 
combination, with sufficient inten- 
sity to be detected at a range of 
over two kilometers in reasonably 
well-conducting rock. The small cyl- 
inders are detectors, equipped not 
only to receive and analyze the 
wave coming through the ground 
but to measure electronically their 
location with respect to each other 
and the main station. I can use as 
many of them as I please, up to 
the full dozen; but they can be 
planted only a little way below the 
surface. There exists equipment for 
getting readings at depths compar- 
able to that of the transmitter, but 
I don’t have it. As it stands, by 
spotting the receivers carefully I 
can get a pretty good picture of 
the formations for a radius of a 
kilometer and a depth even greater 
with ten minutes measuring — and 
ten hours computing.” 

“How far out do you plan to 
place these receivers?” the guide 
asked pointedly. 

“Well — I hadn’t made a detailed 
plan of that. I’d rather like to have 
them in radiating lines of three, the 
lines spreading about fifteen de- 
grees, and the individual cylinders 
about two hundred meters apart.” 

“And just how were you going to 
place them? I gather that someone 
has to walk the best part of four 
kilometers — or do these things fly, 
in addition to their other abilities?” 

“Er — someone walks. I thought

perhaps, since you don't like the 
idea of my going alone through the 
jungle, that I might stand guard over 
Take in the pit while you set them 
out.” 

“Hmm.” The guide did not ex- 
plode, to Lampert’s relief. It had 
not occurred to the scientist that 
the job of wandering around a hole 
in the ground waiting for animals 
which never came might get a little 
boring to a man of McLaughlin’s 
background. “Let’s go over first and 
see how Dr. Mitsuitei is getting 
along. I guess you could stand over 
him with a gun for half an hour. 
Of course, the cover runs danger- 
ously close to the pit. Maybe we’d 
better burn it off to a safer dis- 
tance — still, I guess that won’t be 
necessary. You can stand out here 
where it’s relatively clear, and see 
all the approaches to the pit. Some- 
thing might jump in without your 
having time to hit it, and you’d at 
least see it and could get there fast 
enough to do any shooting neces- 
sary.” 

They approached the hole and 
looked in. Mitsuitei was working 
busily. A fair quantity of earth lay 
spread on the rock, and some two 
thirds of the length of the crack 
had been excavated to a depth of 
perhaps a quarter of a meter. The 
geophysicist attracted the little 
man’s attention and told him of the 
plan; Mitsuitei nodded and bent 
once more to his work. 

The Felodon was becoming rest- 
less. It could hardly be hungry as 
yet; but it was on its feet, snarling 
silently as it had when the helicopter 
first entered its ken. For perhaps 
THE GREEN WORLD 


a minute it stood; then, with the 
same air of determination it had 
shown days before and scores of 
kilometers away, it began to thread 
its way through the underbrush to- 
ward the river — and the digging 
site. 

s 

44TT1 stand where you suggested, 
A and never take my eyes off 
the pit,” Lampert promised. 

“Then I’ll come back to find you 
missing,” replied the guide. “You’re 
guarding yourself too, remember. 
Don’t keep your eyes on anything. 
Keep them moving.” 

He finished distributing the little 
cylinders in the various pockets of 
his outer clothing, and moved off 
in the direction Lampert had in- 
dicated. He looked back frequently, 
but each time saw the scientist alert. 
When the underbrush finally cut off 
the view, he refused to worry too 
much. 

Actually, McLaughlin had gone 
to considerable pains to make the 
jungles of Viridis sound more dan- 
gerous than they really are. His 
conscious motive was to make the 
inexperienced members of the party 
alert enough for their own safety. 
It was quite true that a man could 
be killed in quite a variety of ways 
in those rain forests. There was a 
distinct possibility, however, that he 
also wanted to impress them with 
the importance of his services. 

He did not, therefore, suffer 
much from anxiety during his walk, 
though on the other hand he wasted 
no time. He had, of course, only a 
rough idea of the distance he had 
traveled, though he was able to keep 

53 



his direction with a small impulse- 
compass tuned to the seismic ap- 
paratus and forming part of its 
regular equipment. 

He dropped three of the cylind- 
ers at the required intervals, as 
nearly as he could guess, forcing 
each a little way into the ground as 
Lampert had shown him; then he 
turned at right angles, walked what 
he hoped was the right distance and 
started back toward the site, plant- 
ing equipment as he went. Out 
again, in again; and the last of the 
dozen tubes was in the ground. 

Mitsuitei’s shovel scraped deeper. 

Lampert, glancing up and around 
every few seconds, made minute ad- 
justments to the controls of his seis- 
mic apparatus. Its little mole robot 
had started on its downward trip. 

The Felodon lurked thirty yards 
from the point where Lampert was 
standing, protected from his sight 
by the undergrowth and by one of 
the piles of dirt thrown up by the 
machine which had dug the pit. It 
seemed to be looking through the 
soil at the spot where the man was. 
The snarl was still on its face, but 
no muscle moved in its long body 
ft had been there for minutes with- 
out moving; it had frozen similarly 
when McLaughlin had passed it on 
his way out. Now it simply stood 
and waited. 

On a cliffside kilometers away, 
Ndomi Sulewayo gave utterance to 
the first profanitv Krendall had ever 
heard him use. They were on op- 
posite sides of the block containing 
the fossil, so neither could see the 
other Krendall, naturally, asked 
what was wrong. 

54 


“Don’t tell me a bug got through 
one of these suits!” 

“Worse, if possible. I told you 
this foreleg — ” both had been care- 
fully avoiding the use of such words 
as “arms” — “was sticking out side- 
ways, so that I was afraid we might 
have cut off part of it in digging 
the tunnel.” 

Krendall nodded. “I remember. 
Did we?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Eh? How come? I should think 
there’d be no doubt, one way or the 
other, if you have that much of the 
limb clear.” 

“Well, I haven’t. I got as far as 
the bone goes — and right there I 
run out of tuff and into the lime- 
stone. If there’s anything more, it’s 
in an entirely different kind of rock, 
which is a trifle unlikely; but I’m 
going to have to check the blocks 
we cut from this part of the tunnel 
in order to make sure, and I don’t 
look forward to the job at all.” 
Krendall, properly sympathetic, 
came around to Sulewayo’s side to 
look, and agreed that the search 
was necessary. The bone the younger 
man had been clearing ended in a 
joint of the type they had come to 
regard as typical of the creature’s 
limbs; and this had occurred almost 
exactly at the surface they had left 
when first outlining the block with 
the saw. 

Sulewayo, with a grunt of dis- 
gust, dropped his tools and went 
out into the rain, where the blocks 
cut from the cliff had been piled; 
Krendall, nobly sacrificing his per- 
sonal inclinations, went along with 
him. 


IF 



T he search lasted for a long 
time; for a long time, in fact, 
after it became evident that it was 
going to be useless, for the chance 
of a perfect specimen is not easily 
thrown away. Finally, however, 
Krendall straightened up with a 
sigh. 

“I guess we’ll have to be satisfied 
with a restoration on one side,” he 
said wearily. “I hope someone fifty 
years from now doesn’t find another 
and discover that it’s a sort of verte- 
brate fiddler crab, with one fore- 
limb ending in a paw or claw some- 
thing like five times the size of the 
one on the other.” 

Sulewayo gave a gloomy assent, 
and the two went back to work in 
their respective tunnels. 

Lampert saw McLaughlin the in- 
stant the underbrush made it pos- 
sible, a fact which the guide later 
admitted was to the scientist’s credit. 
He had, of course, been eagerly 
awaiting that return, for the trans- 
mitter was down to its first set depth 
and awaiting only the word that all 
receivers were in place. He called 
eagerly the moment the guide came 
within earshot. 

“Everything down?” McLaughlin 
nodded. ' 

“Everything down, as nearly as 
I could tell the way you said. How 
long will the readings take?” 

“Only a few minutes. I’ll take a 
couple of calibration shots from ten, 
fifteen and twenty meters depth; 
then ones at fifty, a hundred and 
so on down as far as the mole will 
go. The shooting takes practically 
no time. It’s the drilling that will 
hold us up.” 

THE GREEN WORLD 


“What then?” 

“Well,” Lampert smiled, “after 
that the usual procedure is to pick 
up the receivers and place them in 
a similar pattern in a new direction. 
If the field crew doesn’t go on strike, 
we take the whole circle about the 
transmitter.” 

“I was afraid of that,” grunted 
McLaughlin, as he stopped by the 
machine. “Well, let’s go.” The two 
men bent over the controls in a 
silence broken only by the scraping 
of Mitsuitei’s shovel a dozen meters 
away. Lampert pressed his shot but- 
ton, and a light on the panel flashed 
white momentarily. Below their feet, 
unfelt, the pulse of sound energy 
raced outward, echoing from the 
walls of deepstriking joints, from 
the boundaries between rocks of dif- 
fering densities or elastic constants, 
from the walls of caverns deep in 
the limestone; some tiny portion of 
the energy from time to time en- 
countering and affecting one of the 
tiny receivers McLaughlin had 
buried. 

As each receiver gathered its bit 
of data, it retransmitted the infor- 
mation to the master unit; and 
everything was recorded on a single 
sheet as the milliseconds sped by. 
Long before a full second had 
passed, the first of the pulses had 
damped out as heat energy, and 
enough had been transmitted for 
the machine to obtain an adequate 
averaging record. The light blinked 
out again. Lampert nodded in satis- 
faction, and sent the mole down- 
ward once more. 

“Look, good. Now the next set,” 
he remarked. 

33 



A s that pulse of seismic energy 
went forth, the Felodon rose 
to its full height, almost showing 
itself over the pile of dirt which 
was now its sole protection from the 
view of the men. The snarl on its 
face seemed to grow fiercer, if that 
were possible. For just an instant it 
seemed tom by conflicting desires. 
But that was for just an instant; any 
tendency to flee was smothered be- 
fore it could take full form. There 
were two men now to worry about, 
and correspondingly less chance for 
the opportunity it had been await- 
ing. But the opportunity came. For 
just a moment the guide looked 
down at the panel which was ab- 
sorbing Lampert’s full attention. In 
that moment a green-and-lavender 
streak flowed over the heap of soil 
in a single leap and vanished into 
the pit. It must have been timed 
and guided by the mysterious sense 
McLaughlin had mentioned. It could 
see none of the men when it 
leaped, yet it timed the act for the 
moment none were looking, and 
landed directly on Mitsuitei. 

The little archaeologist never 
knew what hit him. He died with- 
out a sound, and the killer, as 
though nothing lived anywhere in 
the neighborhood, settled down to 
its meal. 

In this it nlust have been disap- 
pointed. The chemicals in the cloth- 
ing designed to repel Viridian in- 
sect were equally obnoxious to the 
carnivore, and it made no serious 
attempt to get through them. How- 
ever, not all of the body was pro- 
tected in this way. 

A second pulse went from the 


buried transmitter, and then a third, 
each from a point a few meters 
deeper than the last. Lampert’s at- 
tention, of course, was centered on 
his controls. McLaughlin’s eyes were 
once more sweeping restlessly over 
the surrounding landscape. Both 
heard the sounds coming from the 
pit, but neither interpreted them as 
anything more than the scraping of 
Mitsuitei’s shovel. Neither, of 
course, considered them conscious- 
ly. Their attention was finally at- 
tracted by something decidedly 
more noticeable. 

The Felodon did not — or could 
not? — remain at its meal for more 
than a few moments. Its apparent 
indifference to the other men 
changed once more to what seemed 
like an internal struggle. An observ- 
er would have been sure, up to 
now, that it was using its peculiar 
sense to avoid the sight of men with 
guns; but that hypothesis failed 
now. 

As Lampert started the mole ro- 
bot downward once more, the Fe- 
lodon leaped out of the pit toward 
the two men — regardless of the 
fact that McLaughlin was facing to- 
ward it. 

VIII 

M cLaughlin saw the fanged 
head emerge, and his reflexes 
took over instantly. A streak of 
flame passed beside the leaping 
carnivore, exploding into a white- 
hot blossom of blazing gas as it con- 
tacted the pile of dirt on the far 
side of the pit. The guide ducked 
and rolled frantically sideward as 

IF 


56 



another spring carried the creature 
toward him. Claws raked the air 
past his shoulder, and he fired again 
before the roll was complete and 
without any sort of aim. 

Men and beast alike were spat- 
tered with white-hot droplets of 
metal from the seismic recorder as 
the second shot caught it squarely; 
and this seemed to be enough for 
the carnivore. Its next leap was 
away from the men instead of to- 
ward them. A geyser of steam and 
mud erupted beside it as Lampert 
finally got his weapon into action, 
and before the vapor had been 
beaten down once more by the rain 
the animal was out of sight behind 
the undergrowth. Both men sent 
several shots in the direction of the 
crackling bushes, but accomplished 
nothing except the felling of a tree 
or two and the starting of a bon- 
fire which failed to make any head- 
way against the rain. 

Convinced that the Felodon had 
gone, the men ran to the pit. Lamp- 
ert did not even take time out to 
glance at the wreckage of his equip- 
ment. There was just enough dis- 
tance to cover to let each one realize 
that he had' no idea how long the 
carnivore had been inside, and what 
the “scraping” sound might have 
been. Both slowed down as they ap- 
proached the edge, not relishing 
what they expected to see. But this 
did not prove to be what they had 
expected. McLaughlin’s face, al- 
ready grim, turned gray as he saw 
that his first shot had not merely 
missed the animal at which it was 
aimed. 

The bolt had struck the pile of 
THE GREEN WORLD 


dirt which had been left by the dig- 
ging machinery at the far lip of the 
pit, and scattered most of it to the 
four winds. Perhaps half a ton had 
slid back into the hole from which 
it had originally been removed. 
There was no telling, from above, 
what the Felodon had done to Mit- 
suitei. The upper half of the archae- 
ologist’s body was buried complete- 
ly, and the rest so liberally sprinkled 
with dirt that it was not at once 
identifiable. 

The guide, using language strange 
even to the widely-traveled Lamp- 
ert, leaped the three meters down- 
ward without bothering to use the 
ladder, seized a projecting leg and 
tried to draw the little man clear 
of the soil. Lampert, equally aware 
of the possible value of time but 
feeling that he would do little good 
with a broken leg, made the descent 
in the normal manner. 

By the time he reached the bot- 
tom, McLaughlin had succeeded in 
dragging Mitsuitei almost complete- 
ly clear. Lampert started forward 
to clear the mud from the still hid- 
den face; then he stopped, and his 
stomach abruptly heaved, as he 
realized that the face was not hidden. 

It was gone. 

Mitsuitei had removed the head- 
gear and gloves from his protective 
suit for the normal reason — to see 
and manipulate better. The exposed 
head and hands had formed the Fei- 
odon’s hasty meal. 

T he paleontologists saw the heli- 
copter approaching this time, 
for they were working outside 
the tunnel. Between them on the 

57 



ledge lay a block of stone some 
five feet long, two high and four 
wide — over two tons of material, 
all told, which had been worked out 
of the hole rather ingeniously by 
the men. Partial undercuts had been 
made, rollers worked out of stone 
by the cutter placed underneath, 
and the undercutting completed 
along a plane which sloped slightly 
upward into the tunnel. Of course 
the block had run off the rollers 
once it was out in the open, and the 
men could no more shift it another 
centimeter than they could return 
to Emeraude without the helicopter; 
but at least it was more or less ac- 
cessible by air. They were chipping 
waste rock from the corners when 
the flyer appeared. 

Sulewayo was first up the ladder, 
unburdened this time. They ex- 
pected to have further use for the 
cutter. He noted that Lampert was 
alone in the machine, and promptly 
asked the question the geophysicist 
had been dreading. 

“Where’s Take? We’ve found 
something for him!” 

“I’m afraid he won’t appreciate 
it. He was killed a couple of hours 
ago by a Felodon.” The news si- 
lenced even Sulewayo, and the ex- 
pression on his junior’s face actually 
startled Krendall when he climbed 
through the hatch. 

“Ndomi! What in — ” Lampert 
cut in with the same news he had 
given a moment before. Krendall 
reacted similarly; then slowly low- 
ered himself into a seat. 

He did not ask for details. Both 
men could see that this was not the 
time to put such a question to the 
'58 


pilot, though neither realized then 
the personal responsibility that 
Lampert felt over the incident. 
Krendall pulled a small fragment of 
tuff from his pocket, and looked at 
it thoughtfully. 

Nothing further was said until the 
helicopter landed once more on the 
river near the “city.” McLaughlin 
and the bundle which held what was 
left of Takehiko Mitsuitei were 
waiting on the bank, and * were 
loaded aboard without a sound. 

“It’s early. We’ll take him back 
to Emeraude tonight, and come 
back for your work tomorrow,” 
Lampert said, and lifted into the air 
without waiting for agreement. 

“All right,” replied Krendall, “as 
long as we come back. I don’t think 
he’d have wanted us to stop. I’m 
going to find out about those green 
threads of his, too.” Lampert nodded 
in approval. He had already formed 
a similar determination. For half an 
hour they flew on in silence. 

The Felodon, half submerged in 
swamp water a kilometer down- 
stream from the hill, heard the heli- 
copter hum overhead. It seemed to- 
tally disinterested. For just a mo- 
ment its fanged head pointed up- 
ward, then settled back again. There 
was a burn under its jaw, which 
had been inflicted by metal spraying 
from the ruined seismic apparatus. 
It was more comfortable to keep 
it under water. 

“What was it you found, Ndomi, 
that you thought Take would want 
to see?” Lampert broke the long 
silence. 

“It was when we were undercut- 
ting to get the block out of the 

IF 



tunnel,” Sulewayo answered. “It*s 
just some more of his green threads, 
in the tuff below the fossil. I brought 
a chunk of the rock showing them 
— here.” Lampert nodded without 
taking his main attention from fly- 
ing. 

“Maybe that fossil of yours was 
intelligent after all, then,” he said. “It 
seems to have died under very sim- 
ilar circumstances to Take — just 
above a set of those green threads. 
Maybe it was a member of a party 
like ours.” 

“Maybe. It certainly walked erect. 
The whole body structure shows 
that. If its brain were large enough 
and it had some sort of manipulating 
appendage I’d say it was virtually 
human — in capacity, that is. It 
was more of an amphibian anatom- 
ically.” 

“You have the block out in the 
open. Haven’t you been able to 
study the head and limbs?” 

“No, damn it.” Krendall took over 
from his junior. “That was the big 
disappointment of the whole find. 
The specimen seems to be perfect 
except for missing skull and hands. 
Not a trace of either.” 

The helicopter wavered slightly 
in its path, then steadied as Lamp- 
ert forced his attention back to his 
job. No one said anything for a long 
time, but everyone was thinking. 

S omeone else was thinking too, but 
wasn’t keeping his thoughts to 
himself. They were being spoken, 
and virtually dripped with the think- 
er’s fury. 

“You sloppy, lazy parasites! I 
don’t mind being stuck with a job 

THE GREEN WORLD 


and a deadline, even if it’s a report 
that’s due in only fifty years and 
needs about two hundred for a real 
conclusion. I’d sooner do it all my- 
self than have some of you loose 
thinkers butting in! But if I’m to 
give my whole attention to it so I 
can produce something that won’t be 
laughed at from here to b the Ma- 
gellanic Clouds, how about some of 
you watching what goes on on this 
planet? I didn’t know those crea- 
tures were poking around until they 
began cutting sensor lines! Thirty, 
the protective life we’ve bred on the 
surface was your idea; why didn’t 
you put it to work?” 

The answering words tried to 
be soothing. 

“Thirty was working — ” 
“Dreaming, you mean!” 

“But I put one of the guardians 
on the job for him; it stopped the 
digging, didn’t it?” 

“Sure, after a lot of damage had 
been done. Do you want to come 
out in the open and repair my wir- 
ing — with those space travelers 
poking around? If they find you at 
it, the Council won’t just laugh at 
us; they’ll excommunicate us and let 
this new species of intelligence clean 
us out. Why did it take so long for 
the guardian to do anything?” 

“Well, I—” 

“Well, you were dreaming too, 
weren’t you. Blast it, you’re here to 
do constructive thinking, not just to 
entertain yourself. Haven’t you any 
self-respect? They actually dug out 
Sixteen!” 

“What difference will that make? 
He’s been dead too long to mind it 
himself, and anyway his brain and 

59 



sensor connections were decently 
burned.” 

“But they wouldn’t have had to 
dig much deeper to get someone 
who’s not dead, would they, Ninety- 
Five, my young friend? I suppose 
when they cut one or two of your 
sensors you decided it was time to 
do something. Don’t interrupt! 
I’m talking! This planet is sup- 
posed to be a quiet place where peo- 
ple can expect to spend a decent 
number of centuries at a time think- 
ing, without being disturbed. If 
you’re too young or too lazy or just 
too stupid to do any real thinking 
yourself, at least you can devote a 
little time from your casual amuse- 
ments to making sure that other 
people can . Shut up! You’ll do some 
thinking now or find yourself in real 
trouble! Here’s a problem for you 
to solve, and see that you solve it! 

“You will get my sensors re- 
paired, making sure not only that 
you’re not caught at the job by 
these space travelers but also that 
they don’t realize it’s been done. In 
other words, don’t just neatly fill in 
the hole they made after you’ve fin- 
ished. so they can’t help knowing 


40 


they’re not the only intelligences on 
this world. I don’t know when 
they’ll be back any better than you 
do, so you’ll have to guess at your 
own time limit. You can booby-trap 
your canyon with landslides or any- 
thing else to keep yourself from be- 
ing dug out, but if you fail in either 
problem and either of us looks like- 
ly to be found I personally guaran- 
tee you’ll be found in the same shape 
as Sixteen. Now get to work, and 
let me think. If you think you can 
get help or sympathy from anyone 
else on the planet, good luck to 
you.” 

A wave of agreement spread 
along the countless miles of sensor 
wiring that extended through Virid- 
is* crust, but Twenty-Five didn’t 
feel or hear it. He had already taken 
the myriad of tendrils that termin- 
ated his arms away from the mo- 
saic console that formed the end of 
the vast bundles of greenish 
threads coming through the walls of 
his cave, and had settled back in his 
lounging chair. That report — only 
fifty years to have it thought out 
— his full attention went back to it.

ILLUSTRATED BY FINLAY 


He began as a hero. Eons 
later and a universe away, 
he became instead a god! 


i 

*ve come a long, long way to 
die alone, David Greaves thought 
as Defiance •> tumbled through the 
misty shroud of Venus, hope- 
lessly torn apart by the explo- 
sion in her engines. On the console 
in front of him, the altimeter was 
one of the last few meaningful in- 
struments, and it told him there 
were only a few tortured miles re- 
maining before the ship he had 
brought this far — had spent his 
fdrtune in building when no govern- 
ment would yet consider risking a 

DIE, SHADOW! 


manned rocket on his flight — 
would smash down to its doom on 
a planet no man had ever walked. 

Battered and tossed in his seat by 
the ship’s crazy tumbling, Greaves 
tensed the oak-hard muscles of his 
arms and thrust himself up to his 
feet. He wasn’t dead yet. He wasn’t 
dead and, if the slim chance paid 
off, he’d still be present to laugh 
in the government’s face when the 
first, safe, cautious official venture 
finally made its way across the 
emptiness between Earth and the 
Sun’s second planet. 

Dragging himself irom handhold 

41 



to handhold, his tendons cracking 
with the strain, he levered himself 
toward the Crash Capsule, forced 
open its hatch and pulled himself 
through, while the winds of Venus 
tore at the shattered hull and the 
scream of Defiance’s passage 
through the murky sky rose to a 
savage howl. 

Outside the cloud-lashed hull 
there were no stars. Below, no one 
knew what sort of jungle, or sea, or 
desert of whipping poison sand 
might lie in wait. Greaves had not 
cared when he set out, and did not 
care now. If men had always waited 
to be sure, if all the adventurers of 
mankind had waited until the sign- 
posts had gone up, the cave bears 
would still be the dominant form of 
life on Earth, and races undreamed 
of might never know such a thing 
as man to contest their sway over 
the Universe. 

I’ll live to see my share of that, 
Greaves thought as he pulled the 
capsule’s hatch shut and dropped 
into the special padding that, in 
theory, would cushion much of the 
impact. Or else I’ll know I tried. 
He tripped the lever that would 
flood the capsule with Doctor Eck- 
strom’s special anesthetic — the ex- 
perimental compound that might — 
just barely, might — offer a chance. 
■ 

A s the hiss of the yellow- 
tinged. acrid gas became loud- 
er and louder in his ears. David 
Greaves thought again of the al- 
most obsessive lengths to which he 
had gone in making sure that there 
would be such a thing as the capsule. 
The entire project — the decision 
62 


to build the ship, to sacrifice for it 
the personal fortune he had built up 
in his meteoric rise from obscurity 
to being one of the world’s most 
dynamic and certainly youngest in- 
dustrialists — had been marked by 
his fanatical persistence and dedica- 
tion. But that dream had come first, 
and the fortune second — the sole 
purpose of his career, from its very 
beginnings when he was only an- 
other engineer test pilot, had simply 
been to accumulate the .means so 
Defiance could be built. But the 
ship had been three-quarters com- 
plete when he conceived the idea 
for the capsule. He could not even 
now remember exactly when or 
how he had decided that he must 
have some device aboard that would 
protect him from a crash and — 
here was the vital thing he insisted 
upon — keep him alive, no matter 
how injured, no matter how long 
might be necessary, until rescuers 
could reach him. 

For him to even think in terms 
of rescuers — of depending on 
others — was totally uncharacter- 
istic. For him to divert a major 
portion of his dwindling resources 
from work on the ship itself, and 
push toward the elaborate design of 
the capsule, was, in some lights, 
again uncharacteristically foolish. 
But he had done it, and now. 

. Now the anesthetic created by 
the man some said was a medical 
genius and some said was a quack 
had flooded over him. 

He could feel the first effect — 
the calm, the drowsy peace. By the 
time the Defiance smashed into the 
ground — very soon now — his 

IF

metabolism would have slowed to 
a carefully metered rate. It would 
take hours for his heart to beat 
once. To him it would seem as if 
each day was only a few minutes. 
The jagged nerve-flashes of pain 
would be only a faraway slow tingle; 
the blink of an eye would encom- 
pass hours of actual time, and he 
would lie here, safe, asleep, until 
the hatch was opened and he was 
taken out into the air, where slowly 
the effects would wear off. 

Meanwhile, there was more than 
enough gas compressed into the 
capsule’s tanks to keep him perfect- 
ly relaxed for a hundred years. The 
valve — a simple device he had 
sketched out in five minutes, as if 
the design had been part of his mind 
for years — would continue to 
meter out the supply at the optimum 
rate and pressure. 

It was only now — perhaps a 
hundred feet from impact, perhaps 
only a hundred hairs-breadths — 
that he suddenly saw the flaw in the 
design. 

He struggled to reach the valve, 
in a useless reflex, for there would 
have been nothing he could have 
done, no matter how much time re- 
mained. Then he fell back, a twisted 
grin on his face. I’ve come a long , 
long way to frap myself, he laughed 
in his drowsing mind, as the ship 
crashed, and the capsule, torn from 
Defiance’s side, rebounded like a 
cannon shell from Heaven upon the 
outraged soil of Venus, and the 
overhead clouds sprang into flamed 
reflection from the blast of De- 
fiance’s end. 

In the capsule, the valve control- 


ling the flow from the illogically 
copious supply of anesthetic snapped 
off cleanly. David Greaves* lungs 
jolted to the impact as a century’s 
dosage of the high-pressure gas de- 
livered its one giant hammerblow 
of sleep. .Of sleep like death. 

Of sleep so slow, so majestic, that 
only the eternally ageless body 
might testify to life. Of sleep with- 
out end, without motion, until.

T he woman — the sensuous 
ivory-skinned woman with 
eyes like dark jewels and hair like 
midnight framing her red-lipped 
face — kissed him again and then 
drew back to touch his cheek. 

“Wake,” she whispered softly. 
“Wake, sleeper.” 

David Greaves looked up at her 
through slowly dawning eyes. The 
scent of spices was in his nostrils. 
As the woman’s hair brushed his 
face again, the fragrance increased. 

“My name is David Greaves,” he 
said, and looked up at the sky and 
then around him. 

There was now no envelope of 
cloud to hide the face of this planet 
from the Sun; no such shroud as 
had concealed the Venus of his day 
in dazzling white without and muf- 
fled it in somber black within. This 
sky was ruddy, ruddy with the light 
of the day’s last moments, and the 
clouds through which the sunset 
burned were only crayon-strokes of 
ochre across the orange sky. 

He lay in state, facing that sun- 
set, on some sort of black metal 
couch which supported him on a 

IF

multitude of sweeping, back-bent 
arms. Beneath him, a dozen low 
broad steps of olive-green polished 
stone led down to a long forum, 
flagged with the same gold-veined, 
masterfully fitted paving.. Around 
the court ran a low wall, again of 
stone; friezed, and burnished to a 
dull glow. From the wall, tall slim 
pillars thrust into the air. 

And atop each pillar, cast and 
carved in black metal washed by the 
lingering light, crouched a monster. 

No single artist could have 
created such a bestiary of gargoyles. 
Some he could trace in their evolu- 
tion — the vulpine, the crustacean, 
the insectile. Fangs and pincers slit 
the cool, invigorating breeze that 
flowed over the court. Antennae 
quivered and hummed in the air, 
and a myriad legs were poised in 
tension, forever prepared to leap. 
Others were beyond any creation 
he knew of — limbs and wings con- 
torted into shapes that had, un- 
doubtedly, been taken by living 
things ... in lives unimaginable to 
any man. And all of them, imagin- 
able or not, faced toward him for- 
ever. 

At the foot of each pillar, mount- 
ed in a cresset on the wall at its 
base, burned a torch. And so, when 
night fell, then the shadows of all 
these monsters would be cast up- 
ward onto the stars, and he would 
lie sleeping in the pooled light of 
the torches, while all around him 
these creatures stood watch. 

How many nights had he lain 
here? How many centuries to wash 
the fog of sleep out of every nook 
and cranny of his lungs, when each 

DIE, SHADOWI 


breath might take a thousand yean 
— ten thousand? 

B ut he was not done with 
studying his surroundings. He 
had heard sound when he turned his 
head. Now the sound was a rising 
murmur as he lifted his shoulders 
to look down the length of the 
court of monsters toward the far 
end. There were people there. They 
had been seated on stone tiers that 
rose up toward a collonaded temple. 
There he could see an altar through 
the open sides and, on that altar, a 
flame that burned bright and un- 
winking against the outline of the 
lowering Sun. 

The people were rising to their 
feet. From them came an open- 
throated murmur that became a cry 
of savage joy — of unbearable ten- 
sion finding release. 

“Who are they?” he asked the 
woman as he sat up and felt his 
body stretch with power cramped 
too long, as he squared back his 
shoulders and peered through the 
twilight in the court of monsters. 

“Your worshippers, David 
Greaves,” she said, standing beside 
him among the many arms of his 
couch. “The people whose last hope 
you are.” She added softly: “My 
name, though you did not ask, is 
Adelie.” She paused. “I, too, am one 
of your worshippers. Wherever 
there are human beings, throughout 
the Universe, you are worshipped.” 
He looked at her more closely. 
There was a lift to one black-winged 
eyebrow that was less reverent than 
a god might like, though a man 
could have no quarrel with it. She 



stood gracefully on sandaled feet, 
dressed in a single white garment 
girdled around her waist by a belt 
made of the same metal in which 
the monsters were cast. He saw that 
the clasp was shaped into a profile 
of his own face. And he saw from 
the wear that it showed that it was 
old — older than she could be, older 
perhaps than this court. This . 
shrine? He wondered how many 
priestesses had worn that belt. 

How many of his priestesses. 

He frowned and got down, feel- 
ing the touch of the day-warmed 
stone on his bare feet. He was 
dressed, he saw, in a black kilt and 
nothing else. He returned his glance 
to the worshippers and saw that 
the men were dressed similarly, and 
that the women wore flowing, calf- 
length, translucently light robes like 
Adelie’s. 

There was motion at one corner 
of his eye, and he turned his head 
sharply to see the arms of the couch 
sweeping down, folding and bend- 
ing against its sides. Now he saw 
that he had been cradled in the 
arms of a great black metal beast. 
It crouched atop the dais. Its head 
was bent supplicatingly, bright oily 
metal barely visible at the joinings 
of its mechanical body. 

He glanced quickly up at the 
monsters atop their columns. “Are 
they all like that?” he asked Adelie. 

An old man’s gruff voice answer- 
ed him from the other side of the 
beast-couch. “They won’t spring 
down to devour you — you needn’t 
be afraid of that ” Two men came 
into view, one old, one young and 
very slim. The old one rapped the 
66 


couch with his knuckles. “This 
tended you in your sleep. It is made 
in the shape of the most ferocious 
race that ever rivaled Man. It is 
now extinct — as are all those 
others up there, for the same rea- 
son.” 

The thin young man — very pale, 
very long of limb — stretched his 
broad, tight mouth into a smile that 
covered half his face without mirth. 
"Not the most ferocious, Vigil.” 

“Your kind will learn about that,” 
the old man snapped. 

“Not from you and yours,” the 
slim man said lightly. 

Greaves turned to Adelie, who 
waited, poised, while old Vigil and 
the young man quarreled. “Tell me 
the situation,” Greaves said. 

Adelie’s lips parted. But the old 
man interrupted. 

“The situation is that you have 
been awakened needlessly and 
would best go back to sleep at once. 
My daughter and these fanatical 
sheep — ” he waved an angry arm 
at the standing worshippers — 
“have forced me to permit this. But 
in fact Humanity neither needs you 
nor wants you awake.” 

“Oh, on the contrary,” the young 
man said. “Humanity needs its gods 
very badly at this hour. But you are 
only a man, not so?” 

Greaves looked from one to the 
other — the leather-skinned old 
man with his mop of ringleted 
white hair, the young one who was 
human in appearance but somehow 
claimed some other status. “Who 
are you two?” 

“I am Vigil, your guardian, and 
this is — ” ^ 


IF 



“I am Mayron of The Shadows,” 
the young man said, and he held 
himself as carelessly as before, but 
his face looked directly into 
Greaves’s. “See my eyes.” 

There was nothing there. Only 
darkness speckled by pinpoints of 
light; thick, sooty darkness like oil 
smoke, and sharp lights that burned 
through it without illuminating it. 

“Mayron that was First of Men,” 
Vigil said bitterly. 

“Mayron that is First of Shad- 
ows,” the empty-skinned thing re- 
plied proudly, and began to weep 
great, black tears that soon emptied 
it, so that the skin drooped down into 
a huddle on the pave and a black 
cloud in the shape of a man stood 
sparkling in the dusk before 
Greaves. “Mayron that will again 
be First of Men, when all men are 
shadows. Mayron that is already 
First of many men. And which of 
us is a god, David Greaves?” 

A delie’s face glowed with ex- 
citement. Her red lips were 
parted breathlessly. The crowd on 
the tiers had loosed a great, wailing 
moan, which hung over the court 
of conquered .monsters as the first 
stars became visible on the far 
horizon. 

Greaves took a deep breath. He 
could feel his body tensing itself, 
the muscles rippling, as though his 
hide needed comfort. 

“Which of us is a god, man?” 
Mayron repeated softly, his voice 
coming from the entire cloud. “What 
is it you can do against me, you 
whose entire virtue rests on doing 
nothing?” 

DIE, SHADOWI 


“That would depend on what was 
expected of me at this moment,” 
Greaves said. 

“This moment?” Mayron chuck- 
led. “At this moment, nothing.” 

“In that case, get out of my court 
and come back when there’s some- 
thing to do.” 

Mayron laughed, throwing his 
head back, the laughter high and 
insolent. “How like a god! How very 
like the real thing.” 

Greaves frowned. “If you were 
a man, once, you might remember 
how that feels.” But the laugh had 
bothered him. 

“Oh, I remember, I remember. 
And tomorrow we fight, man.” 
Laughing, Mayron bent and picked 
up the skin he had discarded. He 
crumpled it by the waist in one fist, 
and brandished it negligently at the 
worshippers. They shrank back with 
a moan of horror as he strode to- 
ward the far wall. At the wall, he 
flipped the white, fluttering thing 
over, and as a cloud passed through 
the stone. Perhaps on the other side 
he put on his human form again. 
Greaves could not tell. The sun was 
down, and only a little light glowed 
on the far horizon. The torches 
guttered in the court of monsters, 
and the worshippers were hurrying 
up the steps, out through the temple 
and away. 

Ill 

G reaves, Adelie and Vigil stood 
beside the beast-couch. “All 
right,” Greaves said. “Now there are 
things I want to know, and I want 
no quarrels, Vigil.”

“And by what right do you order 
me around?” the old man growled. 
“You may be a god to some, but 
you are not my god.” 

“You owe it to me, atheist. If I 
was awakened today, at this pat mo- 
ment, I could have been awakened 
before. I wasn’t. You kept me 
asleep, guardian, when I could have 
been free as any other man. So 
you owe me.” 

The old man grunted. “You’re 
brave with Mayron and brave with 
me. But all men are brave, each in 
his own way. We need no gods.” 
“But you have one.” 

Adelie touched his arm. “You 
have lived from the beginning of 
human history. And you were a 
great hero. That much the legends 
tell us. You were braver than any 
man, and for your bravery, you 
could not die. While other heros con- 
quered the stars and, in their time, 
died, you lived on. While enemy 
after enemy was beaten by Man, 
and the victorious men died, you 
lived on. The stars and all worlds 
became ours. Men loved and begat, 
and men died, but you lived on. It 
seemed to us that as long as you 
lived, all men would have something 
to remember — how great Man is; 
what the reward of courage can be. 
It seemed ' only fitting that we 
should bring to you the trophies of 
our achievements. It seemed only 
right to believe that you had sur- 
vived to some purpose — that a 
day would come when Man wo.uld 
need his greatest hero.” 

“Precisely,” Vigil snorted. “Man 
worships nothing but himself. You 
were a convenient symbol. It did 
43 


no harm. It may have done some 
good. Of course, the chuckleheads 
took it all literally. And so — thanks 
to Man’s stupid persistence in breed- 
ing idiots as well as men with some 
brains, you, whoever you are, what- 
ever kind of filibustering bravo you 
actually were, have become the 
focus of a cult populated by the 
credulous, the neurotic and those 
who profit by them. I hope you are 
grateful for your legacy!”' 

Greaves looked up at the stars. 
There were some constellations that 
might have been the ones he knew, 
distorted by his transit to another 
viewpoint ... or by time. He was 
no astronomer. 

Vve come a long way , he thought, 
and 1 wonder what the end of it 
will be. “Those who profit from the 
credulous, hmm?” he said to Vigil. 

“I am your guardian and I 
guarded you. As many others have 
done before me, from various mo- 
tives. This is not your first court, 
nor your tenth. The ritual around 
you is compounded from thousands 
of years of hogwash, as witness my 
worshipful daughter who inherits a 
post from some time when every 
venturing hero had to have a leman 
patiently awaiting his return. My 
duties no doubt were originally 
medical. But the couch has been 
attending to that — with some ex- 
ceptions — for centuries. And you 
may be assured, Man’s history has 
not been one unbroken triumph, 
nor his civilization any steady up- 
ward climb. But we built while you 
slumbered. I had thought to pre- 
vent your besmirching Man’s great- 
ness with your cheap legend.” 


IT 



“Or perhaps he was afraid of the 
god he denies,” Adelie murmured, 
her eyes glowing warmly. 

Greaves looked from her to her 
father. “So she believes in me and 
you do not,” he said to Vigil. “But 
it may be you’re not entirely sure 
— and from the looks she gives 
me, it may be she isn’t, either.” He 
grinned crookedly. “Man may have 
climbed, but I assure you he hasn’t 
changed.” 

H e smiled at the looks on 
both their faces. Divinity was 
new to him, but humanity was not. 
If these two had thought perhaps 
they had some dull-witted barbarian 
here — the one for his faith in his 
faithlessness, the other for her pleas- 
ures — it had been time their error 
was corrected. 

“Old man, god or not I have been 
called out . whether it pleases 
you or not. And I won’t willingly 
lay me down to sleep again until / 
think it's time. So you had better 
tell me what all this is about, or I 
will blunder around and perhaps 
break something you’re fond of.” 
Adelie laughed. 

Vigil swung his arm sharply to- 
ward hfer. “This — this would-be 
courtesan was once Mayron’s great 
love, when he was First of ns all. 
Because he could find nothing to 
conquer for her in all the Universe, 
he began dabbling beyond it for a 
worthy prize. And he found it. Oh, 
he found it, didn’t he, my child?” 
“Be careful, Father,” Adelie spat. 
“The worshippers follow me now 
that I’ve wakened him as promised, 
and you — ” 

DIE, SHADOW! 


“Quiet,” Greaves said mildly. “He 
was telling me something.” 

“That I was,” Vigil said angrily, 
while his daughter’s look at Greaves 
was the least sure it had ever been, 
“and for all the need you have of 
it, I might as well not. But if I may 
say it once and get it safd, I can 
then go to my meal and the two 
of you will be free ‘to amuse your- 
selves. Mayron discovered the Shad- 
ows, when his machines touched 
some continuum beyond this one, 
and the Shadows ate him. But like 
the fox that lost his tail in the trap 
and then cozened other foxes with 
the lie that it was better so and 
fashionable besides, Mayron made 
a virtue of his slavery. Those who 
give themselves up to the Shadows 
never rest and never hunger. They 
know no barrier. And no love. No 
true joy. No noble sorrow. An un- 
tailed fox is safe from catching by 
the tail. A Shadow has no spirit, no 
humanity, no — soul. But there are 
always dunderheads. Mayron has 
them, and down in that city of hit 
down there — ” the old man waved 
a hand at the horizon, but all 
Greaves could see from where he 
stood were the glowing tops of what 
he took to be three fitfully active 
volcanoes — “he has a city full of 
dunderheaded shadows who go to 
some temple he has built and enter 
the Shadow chamber to be changed. 
The admission is easily gained; the 
price of freedom from human care 
is humanity.” 

“And up here,” Greaves said, 
“other dunderheads come to gain 
what in exchange for what?” 

“Gain at least some sort of af- 

<9 



firmation at the cost of remaining 
men!” the old man growled. "If they 
are simple, at least they are human! 
And even an intelligent man can 
see the value in what is embodied 
here.” 

"As witness yourself. Yes.” 

"/ didn’t want to wake you! We 
know enough so you could have 
been awakened centuries ago. But 
to what purpose? To turn another 
hooligan loose to upset civilization, 
and lose the symbol of that precious 
thing? When Man himself can res- 
cue himself? But, no, this one, this 
supersition-ridden tramp I wish I’d 
strangled in her cradle — she stirred 
the worshippers up, she arranged 
the combat between yourself and 
Mayron, she — ” 

"When and where?” 

"What?” 

"This fight Mayron and you have 
both spoken of.” 

"Tomorrow at noon. In the city. 
But there’s no need for it. Tomor- 
row Mayron dies, and the other 
Shadows die. You can watch or not 
— as long as you stay out of the 
way.” 

Greaves looked at Adeiie. "Your 
daughter, Vigil, does not look much 
impressed.” 

"Impressed! Impressed!” The old 
man was very nearly dancing with 
rage. "I’ll show you! Come with me.” 
Vigil turned without looking back 
and pattered rapidly down the steps 
of the dais, his calloused feet slap- 
ping indignantly on the time-buffed 
stones. 

Greaves frowned after him. Then 
he jerked his head to Adeiie. "Come 
on,” he said, and they, too, walked 

70 


quickly down the length of the 
court of the conquered monsters. 
And for the first time since their 
creation the pillared gargoyles did 
not have to bear the sight of Man. 

T he scent of Adelie’s fragrance 
was in Greaves nostrils again 
as they followed the old man 
through the temple, past the altar 
where the eternal flame burned 
bright enough to sting. He said 
nothing to her. She volunteered no 
words of her own. But she walked 
close enough to brush his thigh with 
hers. Greaves smiled appreciatively. 

Vigil led them to a small chamber 
in one wing of the temple. He flung 
open the door with a clatter of 
bolts in a concealed lock, and 
pointed inside. "Look — the two of 
you. It’s not just Mayron who can 
dabble with machines. For every 
clever man, there is another just as 
clever.” 

A gun of green metal was mount- 
ed on a pedestal in the center of the 
chamber. Slim and graceful as a 
wading bird with one extended leg, 
it poised atop its mount and sang 
quietly of power and intent to kill. 
The friezed walls of the chamber 
hummed in harmonic response to 
the idle melody of the gun. Greaves 
felt his hackles rising unreasonably, 
and he very nearly growled with 
outrage at the sight of it. 

"Tomorrow at noon,” Vigil said 
in a high, triumphant voice, "the 
weapon will be swung to point 
through that window and down up- 
on Mayron ’s city. And when it is 
done, there will not be a single 
Shadow alive down there.” 


IF 



Greaves walked to the window in 
the chamber’s far wall and looked 
down. But it was dark below; noth- 
ing to mark the outlines of a city 
as cities had been in the time he 
remembered. The temple apparently 
stood atop a high hill, with the city 
in a great valley at its foot, but 
again all Greaves could see were 
three glowing mountaintops across 
the way, and, beyond them, the 
night sky. 

Then suddenly one of the vol- 
canos flared for an instant, and the 
few overhead clouds reflected redly 
down into the valley. 

Greaves caught his breath. The 
city had emerged black and im- 
mense, extending for miles, its light- 
less towers like the spine-bones of 
a beast half-eaten and rotting in a 
tidal pool. Then the light was gone, 
and once again there was nothing 
visible down there — if the undead 
beast had chosen to bestir itself and 
stealthily move on some errand of 
the night, no one standing here 
could have known until it was too 
late. 

“So that’s the city of the Shad- 
ows,” Greaves said. 

“The city that was once the First 
City of Man,” Vigil said bitterly. 
“That Mayron has made into an 
outpost of Hell. Where no man 
dares live; where they say that those 
with Shadows, once they were in 
sufficient number, dragged women 
and children into the Chamber of 
Shadows so that their men, heart- 
broken, joined them when their 
Shadow-children returned to plead 
with them.” 

“And this gun of yours is going 
DIE, SHADOW1 


to do what to them?” he asked. 

“Kill them.” 

“I know that. How?” Greaves 
stared at the old man through nar- 
rowing eyes. 

“A beam of power, made of the 
stuff that spins within all things — 
the pure force of this continuum.” 

“You mean this thing is some kind 
of particle emitter — an electron 
or photon gun?” 

44/^vur science need not con- 
v>^cern itself with crudities like 
names, barbarian. This gun was 
made as a song or a poem is made 
— in the mind of a man who 
dreams weapons where another man 
might dream bridges . and when 
the gun finds its fruition, tomorrow 
when Mayron expects no mightier 
enemy than you, then the beam will 
sweep that city, and when it stops 
Mayron’s city will be a tomb for 
empty skins. And Man will build an- 
other First City, and those who fled 
shall have a place again, and — ” 

“Who built — who dreamed — 
this piece of ironmongery?” Greaves 
growled. “Who was the poet — 
you?” 

“Yes! Why not? Do you think be- 
cause 1 am an old man — ” 

“A heedlessly spiteful one who 
hasn’t stopped to think.” 

“Stopped to think! Look!” Vigil 
seized the torch at the doorway and 
lifted it high. “Did you think I wasn’t 
sure? That the weapon has not been 
tested?” 

Now Greaves could see why the 
gun sang rather than rested in quiet 
patience. A Shadow hung against 
the far wall, supported by its out- 

71 



stretched arms, its hands sunken 
wrist-deep in the stone. And though 
it jerked its legs and struggled feebly 
to be free, the hands remained 
trapped. Under the sound of the 
idling gun, he could distinguish a 
quiet, thin, whimpering. 

Adelie laughed softly to herself. 

Vigil crowed: “He cannot move 
— what little strength remains to 
him is needed for bare existence . 
if I were to touch that control — 

“The weapon is at its lowest set- 
ting — it has incomparably more 
power than that; it has the power 
of all the Universe in it — and 
look what it can do when it is bare- 
ly tapped in to its source of power!” 

Greaves rumbled in his throat. 
Suddenly the gun’s song was more 
than he could stand. He barely 
seemed to move, but Vigil had time 
to shout, the outraged cry beginning 
to echo in the chamber when sud- 
denly there came the snap of rend- 
ing metal, and a choked stammer 
from the gun. And then Greaves 
had the gun in his hands, complete- 
ly torn from its pedestal. He threw 
it out into the night in a bright 
flash of fire that bathed them all 
in a thunderclap of light. Greaves 
stared after it, his teeth bared, the 
horrid sound of his hatred still 
rumbling within him When that had 
dwindled, leaving him with his 
heavy chest heaving for air, the 
trapped Shadow had vanished, no 
doubt to tell Mayron that Human- 
ity’s godling had gone insane. 

Adelie was very pale. Vigil was 
trying to speak. 

And that from the old man was 
enough .to bring back the first 

n 


scarlet edge of the fury he had 
turned on the gun. 

“Close your mouth!” Greaves 
commanded him. “I have to go fight 
Mayron tomorrow, and I don’t 
want another word out of you. Go 
find something useless to do. Adelie, 
I want a bath, some food and drink. 
Right now!”

D uring the night, he asked 
Adelie: “I’m supposed to fight 
him with my hands, is that it? Or 
with simple weapons of some kind? 
And this will prove to the worship- 
pers all over the Universe or to 
the Shadows that either my or 
Mayron’s way of life is right?” 
“Yes,” she said. “And you are 
very strong. I’m sure you will win. 
I was sure when I suggested it to 
Mayron. He’s so completely con- 
fident — I knew I could trick him 
into it.” 

Later, he asked her: “Tell me — 
was there a famous weapon poet 
in First City?” And he took her 
hand, not letting go of it. When 
she asked him, once, hesitantly, 
why he had broken the gun, he an- 
swered honestly: “Because it seemed 
hateful.” And other than that, they 
said very little to each other during 
that night, and whatever they did 
say had about as much truth in it 
as all the things they had said or 
he had been told from the first mo- 
ment of his awakening. He did not 
sleep. For one thing, he felt no 
need of it. For another, he was 
frightened. He did not want to be 
a Shadow. 


IF 






In the morning he had forgotten 
fear. Steps led from the temple to 
a pathway that wound down toward 
the city. He stood for a moment at 
their head, with the altar burning 
behind him, and then stepped out 
into the morning, with Adelie and 
Vigil folowing. 

There were people waiting out 
there. They lined the path, mur- 
muring among themselves. As he 
strode along they fell in behind him, 
leaving behind the temporary shel- 
ters they had put up when they fled 
from the city and took refuge here. 

“Sheep,” Vigil snorted as he 
padded through the dust beside 
Greaves. “All right, let them see you 
brought down. I’ll make another 
gun — if your stupidity hasn’t 
robbed me of the time I need — 
and then they’ll see. .” 

“I’m sure that if I lose today, 
Mayron will give you all the time 
you need. Maybe he’ll even send 
that same Shadow poet back to you 
with whatever story you’ll believe 
this time.” 

“What — ?” Vigil stammered. 

“What did he tell you? That he 
would create the gun for you be- 
cause he hated the Shadows, even 
though he was a Shadow? Did he 
tell you how he remembered how 
fine it was. to be a man? Is that 
the story you believed? You simple, 
credulous murderer! And you re- 
paid him by testing it on him. As 
he well suspected you might. It’s not 
only humans who can be brave. 
Or sacrifice themselves for the 
ferocity of their race. Or were you 
too busy taking Humanity’s name 
in vain to ever consider that? You 


never dreamed that gun. Not you 

— you may be foolish, but you 
don’t hate this Universe.” 

Vigil was blinking at him. “What 

— ?” 

Adelie laughed. “Last night, fa- 
ther. He asked me about weapon 
posts. There’s no use trying to lie 
out of it.” 

Greaves smiled at her. “That’s 
right. I asked you, and from that 
moment on you knew I was cleverer 
than Mayron thinks. But you never 
got away to tell him that, did you? 
You know,” he said thoughtfully, 
“you’d better hope I win today. 
Mayron won’t be too fond of you 
if I give him any more shocks.” 

Adelie grinned. “I thought of 
that. But if you win, he dies. And 
if you die . ?” 

“You will have had your glory 
anyway? You will have engineered 
the battle of the gods, and dabbled 
in other pleasures, too?” Greaves 
was still smiling, but Adelie’s eyes 
grew wider. “Maybe it’ll be that 
simple, Adelie. But who can tell 
the minds of gods, hmm?” 

And so David Greaves strode in- 
to the city of Shadows, followed 
by a fearful multitude and two bad- 
ly shaken people. He walked down 
a broad avenue at whose end some- 
thing black bulked and glimmered, 
while things with black-filled eyes 
stood watching thin-lipped. And as 
he walked he showed none of his 
fear. 

H e stopped at the end of the 
avenue, with the tall towers 
looming over him, and stood facing 
the Temple of Shadows. There was 

IF 


74 



no sign of life in the square black 
opening that served as a door for 
the featureless stone block, dark 
but not as dark as a Shadow. 

He threw back his head and 
called: “Mayron!” 

The worshippers huddled around 
him. Vigil, like them, was throwing 
anxious looks over his shoulders as 
the city’s Shadows crowded closer. 
Adelie murmured: “There he is.” 
And he was, trotting lightly down 
the steps, smiling. He wore his hu- 
man skin as naturally as if it were 
more than a cloak, and Greaves 
had to look hard to see that when 
he smiled his lips stretched but no 
teeth showed. 

“Well, Man in all your pride. 
Are you ready?” 

“Ready as any man. How do you 
propose to go about this?” 

“Adelie didn’t tell you?” 

“She told me as much as I asked. 
I didn’t ask much. Could you sug- 
gest any way I could have refused 
the conditions, no matter what they 
are? That loses the fight right there. 
Wasn’t I supposed to understand 
that? Do you think politics is a 
recent invention?” 

“Fierce, fierce,” Mayron mur- 
mured. “Well spoken.” He chuckled. 
“When I was a man, I would have 
liked you.” 

“Get to the business, Mayron.” 
The Shadow held up his hand. 
“Not so fast. Perhaps we can arrive 
at some — ” 

“Arrive at nothing. Put up or shut 
up. Vigil no longer has that mon- 
strous gun and there’s no point in 
this for you today. But there is for 
me, and you don’t have much time 

DIE, SHADOWI 


to realize that.” He glowered at the 
Shadow, feeling the rage, feeling 
the onrush of the bright white ex- 
altation when the body moves too 
fast for the brain to speak, when 
what directs the body is the reflex 
founded on the silent knowledge of 
the brain’s deep layers, where the 
learning has no words. 

Mayron frowned. I-fis head was 
cocked to one side. If he had had 
eyes, he would have been peering 
at Greaves* face. But he said noth- 
ing; he had lost the moment, and 
now Greaves used it. 

“You scum,” Greaves said, his 
voice booming through the Temple 
square for all the Shadows to hear. 
“A weapon that drains the power of 
this continuum! You leech — you 
would have had that doddering old 
man put all my stars out!” 

And now the moment was at its 
peak, and Greaves screamed with 
rage, so that the faces of the towers 
were turned into sounding boards 
and the shout crackled in the air 
like thunder. He jumped forward, 
one sweeping arm tossing Mayron 
out of his way and flailing for bal- 
ance, while Greaves sprang into the 
Temple and charged the Chamber 
of Shadows. 

A nd now the fear — the great de- 
vouring fear that came like 
fangs in his belly but did not 
stop him. Now the fear as he 
burst through the acolytes and into 
the black, light-shot sphere that 
quivered at the focus of Mayron’s 
machine. And he stood there, feel- 
ing the suck not of one voracious 
universe but many — all the uni- 


75 



verses that had eaten the over- 
curious Mayron and sent back a 
Judas goat in his skin to conquer 
what belonged to Man. Feeling the 
icy cold, and the energy-hunger that 
could suck Man’s Universe dry and 
still leave a hunger immeasurable. 

But the rage — the rage that 
came to him, that came to the god 
uncounted generations of men had 
made while David Greaves lay 
sleeping but his deepest mind lay 
awake, feeling, feeling the faith, 
knowing the splendor of what Man 
had done — The rage that could 
make a god, that could give a crea- 
ture like David Greaves the power 
to create, to dream a man — to 
make a David Greaves who would 
lie waiting, ready to become a 
god. 

That rage went forth. 

And in parallel continuums of 
life unimaginable, the dawn of 
Apocalypse burst upon suns un- 
nameable and worlds unheard-of — 
upon all the universes which were 
the true Shadows. The god who was 
David Greaves again, when the 
rage had passed — that image 


which Man himself had made stood 
blazing his fury in the Chamber of 
Shadows, and the Universe of Man 
was free and safe. But in the places 
of the Shadows there was no hope, 
no joy, no place of refuge. Man- 
kind was come forth, and galaxies 
were dying. 

One last snap of the fangs — one 
moment when the death-spurred 
Shadows almost had their greatest 
prize of all — and then it was over. 
Greaves turned and strode out of the 
blasted Chamber, and the acolytes 
cowered, covering their eyes, not 
yet realizing that once more they 
had eyes. 

D avid Greaves appeared on the 
temple steps, and began walk- 
ing slowly down, his legs shak- 
ing with exhaustion. Adelie watched 
him coming toward her. Around 
her, Shadows that had once been 
men were men again, but at her 
feet Mayron lay without his skin, 
and though her father had fled, she 
did not dare go without learning 
what the look on David Greaves’ 
face meant for her. END

IF • Short Story 


RUNDOWN 


BY ROBERT LORY 


All panhandlers ask for 
dimes — but this one had 
a very special purpose! 


T he subway train announced its 
arrival with a screech of grat- 
ing steel. The man was shoved from 
the car onto the platform by the 
eight p.m. crowd. The noise and the 
abrupt handling of his body brought 
him to awareness. 

Not that he had been asleep or 
unconscious. Although he might 
have been. He didn’t know for sure. 

He found it hard to concentrate, 
but soon a sign over the platform 
came into focus: 

WESTBORO 

It meant nothing to him. The sec- 
ond thing he became aware of did. 

Another train had replaced his, 
and directly in front of him was an 
army of people, dispassionate to- 


wards everything but its one objec- 
tive — to get on. 

They came at him all at once, 
forming a pushing, elbowing, curs- 
ing, jarring mass of humanity. He 
glanced off one to collide with an- 
other. He escaped the punishment by 
a lunge to one side which ended with 
a crash to the cold cement floor. 

He regained some semblance of 
steadiness on his feet and looked at 
the sign. It was still Westboro. It 
still meant nothing to him. 

He was lost. 

What was worse, he couldn’t re- 
member where he was lost from. 

He turned to walk, he didn’t know 
exactly where, when he smashed into 
a little boy eating an apple. 

The boy reacted in a strange 
manner. 


RUNDOWN 


77 


“Leave me alone, you dirty man, 
you/* the boy said. He dropped his 
apple and ran off. Scared. 

The man flushed with embarrass- 
ment, but the boy’s remark made 
him look down at himself. 

He saw a dirty man. Filthy. His 
white shirt — it had been white 
once — was torn at the elbow and 
was covered with grime, his shoes 
at the toes were white where the 
black polish had worn completely 
off his pants reflected no evidence 
of ever having been pressed and the 
right leg was ripped from the knee 
down. 

Two girls in their teens passed 
and giggled. 

He was aware that others had no- 
ticed him. 

“Hey, lookit the bum,” a fat jolly- 
rover called out to his three on-the- 
towning cronies. 

“Bum,” the man thought, and 
reached to his back pocket. 

No wallet But not long ago he 
had one, he was sure, because the 
feel of its absence was there. Some- 
body must have taken it, or he 
might have lost it. In that crowd or 
on the subway or before ... He 
couldn’t remember where he had 
been before. 

The feeling of not remembering 
seemed familiar, and he tried hard 
to think.* But there was nothing 
static in his mind that he could 
hold on to. His mind wasn’t blank 
anymore, it was a jumble. He some- 
how recalled he had been looking 
for his money. He fumbled through 
his other pockets. 

He found a dirty handkerchief 
and two cents. 

78 


The feel of the coins brought ev- 
erything back. 

Quickly he felt his pulse. It was 
slower than he had ever known it 
to be. Sure, there were times before 
when . but then the doctor always 
had been nearby. And this time, the 
most serious time of all — he looked 
up at the Westboro sign — he was 
lost. Perhaps, up on the streets, he 
would recognize something. 

He began to take the stairs at a 
run, but his breath came too hard, 
and he walked the rest of the way to 
the turnstile. The arm caught tight 
as he started to go through and a 
sharp pain want through his groin. 

“That’s the way you go in, pal,” 
somebody offered, and the man 
winced at the few laughs he had 
drawn. He saw the exit sign and 
walked quickly toward it. 

The night lights were just ahead 
as he collided with a woman loaded 
with bundles. They spilled. “Sorry,” 
he said, leaving her to her indigna- 
tion, and at a faster pace he walked 
outside into the cool night air. 

H e had stopped walking and was 
leaning against the door of the 
Inn of Six Horses, which proudly 
displayed its name and namesakes in 
blue and white neon. 

He had recognized nothing. 

He had tried getting to the doc- 
tor’s by cab. but no driver would 
listen to him without first seeing 
the fare, even though he assured 
them all that he could get it from 
the doctor. 

A policeman had told him to 
move along or suffer the conse- 
quences of a thick nightstick. 


IF 



A drugstore proprietor had an- 
swered his request to use the phone 
by threatening to call the policeman 
with the thick nightstick. 

A dime. One dime! 

He remembered his Shakespeare. 

My kingdom for a ... horse? 
Six horses. Maybe, just maybe, at 
the Inn of Six Horses . 

A short man at the bar, com- 
posing one half of the clientele, was 
calling the bartender’s attention to 
the fact that the six horses outside 
outnumbered the customers. 

“Go to blazes,” the bartender 
commented on the short man’s ob- 
servation. 

“I should,” said the short one. 
“Then George here would be 
Uncas, the last of the Mohicans, 
riding your six old white stallions.” 

“How do you know they’re stal- 
lions?” George said. He was lean, 
mean and weary, looking as if he 
had just returned from a hard day 
of peddling vacuum cleaners. 

The door banged shut and three 
pairs of eyes focused on a dirty 
man. 

“Here comes a touch,” said Pete. 

“Please,” said the man, his voice 
shaky and weak. 

“Before you go into your act, 
pal,” Pete said, “understand this: 
Nobody gets nothing free here, this 
ain’t no mission or nothing. This is 
a business like any place else.” 

“A real thriving business,” 
mocked Shorty. 

“Please, a dime, I need a dime, 
that’s all I — ” 

“A dime?” George laughed. “For 
what, a cup of coffee? This is a 


high-class place. Beer costs fifteen 
cents here.” 

Shorty joined in with a snort. 
“Maybe he wants to call his girl.” 

“I need the dime,” the man said, 
leaning on the bar for support. 

“A matter of real life and death, 
huh?” George said. 

“Yes. Look . here, I have two 
cents, you take them.”* 

Pete looked suspiciously at the 
two coins. “We don’t sell nothing 
that costs two cents.” 

“You take the two cents, but 
give me a dime. Please ” 

“Sharp businessman,” noted 
George. 

“This is rich,” said Pete. “Do you 
really expect to buy a dime for two 
cents?” 

Shorty said, “He just noticed how 
well you’re doing. He figures you 
can afford the loss.” 

“Boy, it burns me up,” said Pete. 
“These professional bums make 
more in a week than I see in a 
month.” 

“You keep talking that way, and 
this clown will want to buy your 
business for the two cents,” Shorty 
said. “Ain’t worth it,” George said 
and banged his glass down. “Fill 
it,” he directed Pete. 

As Pete turned, the man made a 
lunge for George’s change on the 
bar. 

“Watch him,” warned Shorty. 

George needed no warning. He 
had seen the man eying his money, 
and he had hoped for just such a 
move. With a right fist to the side 
of the man’s head, George took re- 
venge for a bad day’s work.

The man lay very still on the 
floor. 

44TTThat a paste,” said Shorty, 
▼ V admiringly. “You could 
have killed him like that.” 

“He sure ain’t doing much mov- 
ing,” said Pete, coming around the 
end of the bar. “I’d better take a 
look.” 

“Man, I didn’t hit him that hard.” 

“Well, man , he sure asked for it,” 
said Shorty. “And me and Pete will 

be right here to tell the cops that 
the guy was a crook and tried to 
rob your money. Right, Pete?” 

“George, this guy’s got no pulse,” 
Pete said. 

“Watcha gonna do, George?” 
Shorty said. 

“Just shut up and wait a minute,” 
Pete said. “1 think he’s trying to say 
something.” 

The man’s eyes pleaded with 
each of the three. His lips quietly 
formed then message: 

“Dime.” 

“Wow, talk about persistence,” 
said Shorty. 

George looked at his change on 
the bar. 

He picked up a dime. 

“Hey,” said Shorty, “what are you 
doing?” 

“Shut up,” said Pete. “George’s 
money is George’s money. What he 
does with it is his business.” 

“Look,” George said, “1 didn’t 
mean to hit you so hard. 1 mean, 
I hit you so hard my whole hand 
hurts. So here, you can have the 
dime, i won’t miss it” 


He pressed the dime into the 
man’s hand. 

* * * 

“Holy cow,” said Shorty. It was 
the first sound any of the three had 
made after the man had left, fifteen 
minutes before. 

George stared into the mirror be- 
hind the bar, seeking some mighty 
truth in his own reflection. “He says 
. he says Unbutton my shirt, and 
then ...” 

George fondled some coins in his 
hand. “Then he takes that crazy 
dime, a plain old, regular, crazy 
dime ...” 

Pete poured himself a Scotch. 
“What kind of guy is it, anyway,” 
he said, “who walks around with a 
slot in the middle of his chest that 
he puts dimes into?” 

“Yeah,” said George, “and who 
ticks , yet?” END

SINGLEMINDED 


BY JOHN BRUNNER 

ILLUSTRATED BY FRANCIS 


The Enemy had a secret. Every 
courageous man would find a way 
to , steal it, no matter what it 
cost his conscience — or world! 


T 

T he ship went down staggering 
on a lopsided stilt of fire, 
among the rugged foothills of the 
Lunar Urals. 

Despite the terrifying brilliance 
of the bands crossing the exhaust 
— which showed that the cause of 
the trouble was a resonance insta- 
bility, apt to shake the entire vessel 
to bits like blows from a vast ham- 
mer — the engines went on firing 
after a fashion till one of the land- 
ing legs touched on an outcropping 
rock and tipped the ship over. 
SINGLEMINDED 


It crunched like an eggshell and 
the engines died, leaving its pilot 
stranded but alive. 

Not that that made much differ- 
ence. He had about twelve hours’ 
oxygen in his suit tanks and a liter 
of fortified liquid in his nutriment 
reserve. But he was lost, he was 
some hundreds of kilometers from 
the nearest American base, and he 
was not even sure that he had been 
watched down by the radar there. 

For a while he occupied himself 
with petty things — salvaging what 
instruments had survived the crash, 

SI 



hunting for any oxybottles not 
broken open in the crash, soaking 
inflammable material in the fast- 
drying liquid from the hydraulic 
shockabsorbers in the hope that he 
could fire a beacon when someone 
came to look for him. He considered 
climbing a nearby peak to set up a 
radio and try to beam a line-of- 
sight signal, but had to concede that 
even if he got up far enough for 
the extra height to be useful he 
would use more oxygen and might 
not have enough to get down again. 

He could stay with the ship, and 
that was that. 

Within an hour of the crash, he 
was learning that he was very much 
afraid to die. 

Not ours 

But all are “ now as we are” 
Others to rescue 
No one else knows exactly where 
in thousands of square kilometers 
Suffering follows awareness if we 
leave him 

Agreed impossible but do what 
Avoid contamination 
There is the cured one {cured?) 
Compulsion misliking constrained 
to act consent 

H e waited on the crest of a 
steep rock, able to see over 
the jagged local ground to the 
smoother-seeming plains beyond. He 
was not well used to exposed lunar 
conditions, and the stark blacks and 
brilliant sunlit grays of the landscape 
were maddening; so also was the 
fact that it he did not move rather 
often his suit’s heat-transfer devices 
overloaded, and if his feet were in 
82 


his own shadow they began to 
prickle with cold, while his shoul- 
ders and scalp perspired. 

He did not mind loneliness very 
much. He would never have been 
entrusted with single-handed lunar 
ferry flights if he had shown any 
sign of breaking down from mere 
isolation. But once the extra factor 
of approaching death entered his 
mind, he found it gnawing at him, 
rat-wise. 

To die so much alone, with not 
even a sight of Earth to comfort 
him — that was the intolerable part 
of it. He could die when he chose, 
or when he had to: crack the suit, 
or wait for the oxygen meters to 
hit zero. But he had to die. 

Four hours of waiting, then five, 
then six, and he was beginning to 
break. He could feel himself going, 
like a piece of fatigued steel; he 
knew he must not, should rather 
endure to the eleventh hour and 
beyond, and yet his control slipped 
away until he began to whimper 
involuntarily. 

Enough of that! He put his mind 
to singing, and telling himself stories; 
to reminding himself of friends; to 
reassuring lies about the excellent 
chance of being spotted. But it was 
very difficult. Whenever he let his 
attention wander, he felt the black 
despair encroach on him like tides 
eroding a cliff. 

He had endured eight hours, and 
was uncertain whether he would 
meet his inevitable end as a sane 
man or as a mindless, broken thing, 
when he saw the stirring of dust 
across the plain which indicated the 
passage of a lunar tractor. 


IF 








He imagined at first he was de- 
luding himself. But when he clam- 
bered down from his rock and 
fetched the telescope which some 
Navy-minded bureaucrat had de- 
creed be included in the emergency 
kit of the ship, he saw that the 
tractor was real. Moreover, it was 
headed directly for him. He could 
see few details owing to the reflec- 
tion of the sun on its highly polished 
snout, but that in itself showed it 
was aimed for where he stood. If it 
had been travelling at an angle to 
him, it would have been splashing 
up enough dust to hide its sides. 

N onetheless, thinking pure chance 
might have brought it in this 
direction, he hurried to fire his 
beacon. Turning on the tap of 
an oxybottle, he ignited a few 
scraps of what had been his accel- 
eration couch and made a bright 
blaze until the bottle ran dry. 

The tractor-driver had seen him. 
Out of the blurring dust a brilliant 
light flashed — Morse letters form- 
ing the international reassurance 
sign, l-C-U. 

He felt himself go limp with re- 
lief. He did not realize until some 
moments had passed that he was 
babbling happily, and that if his suit 
radio had survived the crash he 
would have made the oncoming 
driver think he was rescuing a 
lunatic. 

How close would the tractor be 
able to come? Between him and the 
comparatively level plain lay some 
three kilometers of irregular ground, 
creviced and hummocked, over 
which no tracked vehicle could pass 

14 


at more than snail's pace. It would 
help greatly if he could make his 
way to the edge of the plain, he 
thought, and began to scramble for- 
ward, no longer needing to remain 
close to the conspicuous wreckage 
of the ship. At this range, the bright 
orange fabric of his suit would stand 
out against the darker rocks. 

He was so occupied that he failed 
to notice when the tractor passed 
the edge of the plain and kept com- 
ing, over rocks and hummocks and 
crevasses, without slackening speed. 
Only when he paused before tack- 
ling a particularly difficult patch, 
and looked up to see how far he 
had got, did he realize that the trac- 
tor was not what he had assumed. 

Out on the dusty plain, of course, 
it had splashed dust up just as a 
tracked vehicle would have done. 
Now it was on hard ground he 
could see what he would have de- 
duced anyway from its ability to 
tackle broken terrain. This wasn’t 
a tractor from a Western base. This 
was a Russian “moon-walker,” 
tramping on four padded feet ex- 
actly like a mechanical camel with 
an oyster perched on top. Its slab 
sides bore the Soviet red star. 

A million crazy fears filled his 
mind. Automatically, as he strug- 
gled to digest the knowledge of his 
fate, he found his fingers leaping 
towards the cracking valve on his 
suit. But for the long hours of wait- 
ing, in which he had found he was 
afraid of dying, he would have de- 
compressed then and there, and 
made the rescue journey useless. 

Only he checked himself. 

He could live. 


IF 



He would live. And the hell with 
everything else. He was twenty-nine 
years old and that was too young 
to waste the chance. 


T he moon-walker stopped a hun- 
dred meters from him. Below 
the oyster-like pilot compartment a 
door in the slab side slid back, and 
the legs folded to bring the thresh- 
old to within a few inches of the 
ground. More than a little enviously, 
he stepped inside. 

The door gave into a small com- 
partment that served as an airlock. 
It cycled quickly, and before he 
knew what was happening the floor 
was pressing against his feet. He 
was lifted up into the pilot compart- 
ment through another sliding panel 
in the ceiling of the lock. 

“Hullo,” said the pilot. “I am very 
glad to have found you in good 
time.” 

He did not even remember to 
crack his suit in the first moment of 
shock, although his outside pressure 
gauge showed one atmosphere and 
the pilot was unsuited. For the pilot 
was a woman. 

Everyone knew vaguely that the 
Reds made a fetish of sexual equal- 
ity. But he had never imagined for 
a moment that they might send a 
woman out alone on a hazardous 
trip to rescue a foreign pilot. 

She had short-cropped dark hair 
around a rather long, fine-boned 
face; her complexion was sallow 
but her eyes were big and liquid, 
and her teeth were superb. She wore 
a standard undersuit of olive-green 
SINGLEMINDED 


with rank and technician’s badges he 
did not recognize. 

Ideas flashed through his head. 
Possibly he was the first westerner 
ever to go aboard one of these 
moon-walkers. Down in the slab- 
sided compartment beneath his feet 
there was alleged to be a dompact 
fusion engine which was a jealously 
guarded secret, and then there was 
the question of automatic preadjust- 
ment to changes of level in the 
ground, which was baffling many 
investigators; a woman could be 
overpowered and the moon-walker 
directed to the nearest Western 
base. 

The pilot pushed a control home 
and locked it with a turn to the 
left. There was a slight lurch and a 
turning sensation, and the machine 
swung back on its original course 
in the reverse direction. 

“Please — open your suit,” the 
pilot said. Her voice was low and 
pleasant, and her accent good. Then 
she gave a sudden shrill, nervous 
laugh, and checked herself as if she 
were in a state of extreme tension. 
“My name is Olga Solykin, and I 
am more glad than I know how to 
say!” 

“Uh — ” Well, no harm in giving 
his name. “I’m Don Bywater. Thank 
you for — well, saving my life.” 

Something was askew. Suppose 
this situation were reversed. Could 
anyone imagine missing the chance 
to inspect the wreck of a rival space- 
ship, laid out and opened like a 
corpse at an autopsy? Yet already 
she had turned the machine around 
and by now — to judge from the 
view through the excellent ports — 

85 



it was making thirty-five k.p.h back 
towards the base. Not a thought, 
apparently, for the ship. 

Cautious, he cracked the suit at 
last. The air was sweet and good 
after his own canned supply, which 
was partly recycled and never com- 
pletely free of his own body odors. 

“Come, sit down!” the pilot in- 
sisted, patting the vacant co-pilot’s 
chair. “Are you well? Are you hun- 
gry, thirsty? Were you injured in 
the fall? Were you not very lucky?” 
Why was she so eager — almost 
as though she had not seen another 
human being for months? Her eyes 
were bright. Her voice tended to 
shake on occasional words, with 
what Don could only presume to be 
excitement. He glanced round the 
large cabin, noting the usual semi- 
personal touches — the painting of 
Lenin, the photograph of Yuri Ga- 
garin, the bust of Maisky-Artemov 
standing on a little ledge next to a 
package of moon maps. 

The stabilizing equipment was 
fantastic! Listening hard, he could 
faintly discern the hum of a gyro 
somewhere, keeping the cabin dead 
level no matter what kind of 
ground the moon-walker was scram- 
bling over. 

B elatedly he began to peel off 
his suit. He said, “No, I 
wasn’t hurt, thank you. 1 was very 
lucky. The whole of my acceleration 
unit came away in one piece and 
1 was still in it when it hit the 
ground.” 

“I’m so glad!” the pilot cried. She 
turned and felt along a shelf under 
the exiguous bank of controls; the 

86 


machine was obviously completely 
automatic when bound for a known 
destination. She produced a large 
box of candy and some packs of 
cigarettes, and offered them to him 
as he sat down. 

He was so taken aback he forgot 
that it was probably bad to show 
that he was impressed by anything. 
He said, “You can smoke on board?” 

“Oh, yes, if not more than one 
person does at a time. I do not 
smoke, so please, you smoke if you 
like.” She urged the cigarettes to- 
wards him, checked the movement 
and stripped away the cellophane 
wrap with frantic fingers as though 
panicking to be of service to him. 

The tobacco drugged? The candy 
poisoned? All the scores of stories 
which had been poured into his 
mind since he was a child came back 
to him. Anyway, he did not usually 
smoke off Earth, and rarely even 
at home. 

But his nerves were shot to pieces, 
and a smoke would certainly be 
soothing. If there was anything 
funny about the smoke, he told him- 
self, he could throw the cigarette 
away after the first puff. 

There was nothing wrong with it 
at all. It was very good, aromatic 
Balkan tobacco. Although it burned 
rather quickly in the oxygen-high 
air of the cabin it was soothing and 
welcome. 

“And a drink, yes?” she invited. 
“To celebrate the saving of your 
life? I brought you food, vodka, all 
I could find, and the candy for you, 
and the cigarettes — you have not 
been in one of our moon-walkers 
before, yes? Or you would not have 

IF 



asked about the smoking of a ciga- 
rette !” She laughed again, the sound 
coming hard and harsh from her 
full-lipped mouth. 

“Has anybody from my country?” 
he countered bitterly. What was all 
this about, anyway? Some elaborate 
Mata Hari trick? 

“Not even by now?” She seemed 
disappointed. “It is being so long, 
I hoped that — well, it is not really 
so long, I guess. Well, you will like 
to see all of it, then. Shall I show 
you how it is?” She leaned towards 
him, over the side of her chair, her 
face bright and her tongue going 
once from left to right across her 
lips. 

A tentative conclusion jelled in 
Don’s mind. 

This woman — or girl, maybe, 
for she was no older than himself 
— must have been condemned to 
some isolated post for a long tour of 
duty. It was exactly the kind of 
thing that fitted with all the half- 
authorized rumors one was always 
hearing, even more here on the 
moon than back home, because 
here was where the competition was 
fiercest. And the stress of loneliness 
must have made her mentally un- 
balanced. How else to explain her 
weird behaviour? Claiming to have 
brought him candy and cigarettes 
and vodka — he was no psycholo- 
gist, but as guesswork it certainly 
fitted. 

He said, not without some nerv- 
ousness, “Later. In a little while, if 
you like.” Not to arouse any sus- 
picion, that was important. To jump 
at the chance of inspecting the 
works of the moon-walker might 
SINGLEM1NDED 


be fatal. The trick was to be friend- 
ly as long as possible, to find out 
where he was exactly, to get an 
idea of the controls of the machine, 
and then to overpower her and 
walk it to the nearest American 
base. 

CCT X Thereabouts are *we?” he in- 
▼ * quired, as casually as pos- 
sible. “I was too busy fighting the 
controls to take a fix as I came 
down.” 

Well, that was true enough. 

She jumped at the opportunity. 
Flushing a little, she put a finger on 
a switch before her. A previously 
dark screen on the control panel lit 
up with a set of grid-lines and a 
pattern of radar blips. 

The grid lines moved visibly, in 
time with the motion of the moon- 
walker. Don tried not to look im- 
pressed again. 

“Here, you see!” the girl said. “It 
navigates partly by dead-reckoning, 
partly by sighting on the stars. All 
is automatic now. We are here, and 
here are the Ural Mountains in back 
of us, and this red star in the center, 
that is this moon-walker, you un- 
derstand?” 

“And you can — uh — steer it by 
hand if you have to?” 

“Oh, yes!” 

She showed him how. She showed 
him the inspection hatch of the 
fusion engine, and the neat stabilizer 
which kept the cabin level — it 
turned out to be a bowl of mercury 
with hundreds and hundreds of tiny 
electrical contacts around the sides, 
from which a computer drew infor- 
mation about the vehicle’s attitude, 

87 



extrapolating to find the most prob- 
able correction the mechanism 
would next have to cope with. Don 
followed her explanations with 
mounting excitement; it seemed 
there was nothing she would not 
willingly tell him, apparently for the 
simple pleasure of talking. 

In the back of his mind, he was 
calculating. It would be best to take 
over the machine after about a 
couple of hours on board, before 
they came too close to its home 
base, but not so soon that her sus- 
picions would not be lulled. Then 
he could easily locate the nearest 
American base. There were rather 
few in this region, for it was mainly 
a Soviet preserve. And then he 
could. 

“Ah!” she said suddenly, and 
cocked her head. They were looking 
down through the inspection hatch 
over the forward radar, watching 
the ground-scanner weave back and 
forth on the far side of a pane of 
tough glass. 

Don felt a stir of alarm. “What 
is it?” he demanded. 

“We are coming in at my base. 
Listen!” 

“We’re what?” Pictures of a dozen 
wasted chances flashed through his 
mind. “But — why so soon?” 

“Oh, you mean why if we are so 
near where you crashed did 1 come 
so long after you fell down? Why, 
there was much argument for and 
against to rescue you.” She gazed 
at him with almost ridiculously 
melting eyes. Suddenly she thrust 
out her hand and snatched his, 
squeezing it briefly. “I am so glad 
they decided it must be done!” 


“They?” Don stared wildly to- 
wards the cabin ports. Yes, it must 
be true. The machine was marching 
in between two low cliffs, towards 
a dark, over-roofed aperture; then 
it was in the shadow with the sud- 
denness of a light being switched 
off, and the engine’s note changed 
down to an idling buzz. But if this 
woman hadn’t gone crazy from iso- 
lation, then what — ? 

He pulled his hand away. “How 
many people are there at your 
base?” he demanded. 

“Oh, many, many! Ninety, a hun- 
dred. But I have been so alone for 
so long!” 

There was a noise from below — 
first, air hissing into an oversized 
lock, then the hurry of footsteps. 
Dazed, he said, “Alone? Are you 
crazy?” 

“With no one to talk to, yes, I 
have become nearly crazy!” she as- 
serted, nodding her dark head fran- 
tically. “They do not talk, you un- 
derstand! They do not give me a 
single word!” 

So she was a lunatic. And he was 
trapped. Don made a dash for the 
front of the cabin. But just as he 
was forming his intention the helmet 
and shoulders of a spacesuit ap- 
peared on the platform under the 
cabin which had previously lifted 
him from the airlock below. He was 
too close to stop himself. All the 
newcomer — a stolid-faced man 
with big shoulders — had to do was 
trip him. 

He measured his length on the 
deck. His forehead hit the base of 
the pilot’s chair, and there was long 
darkness. 




IF 



in 

H e awoke painfully, with his 
head aching and his eyes 
blurred, in a room that might well 
have been at any of the moon-bases 
he knew. Starkly furnished with 
bunks and one table, plus some 
lockers and shelves on which were 
microfilms, a reader and some re- 
cording spools, it was about as 
homelike as a fallout shelter. 

He had a little delirium for a 
while before he regained full con- 
sciousness. He could not tell whether 
he actually saw, or only imagined 
he was seeing, Olga’s face above his 
own, very pale and worried. He was 
confused, unable to decide whether 
the crash had been a dream and he 
was really in one of the American 
bases, or whether he was dead. 

When things finally straightened 
out, he found that Olga was there, 
on a stool beside the bunk, watch- 
ing him with terrible intensity. 

When he opened his eyes, she 
seemed to break suddenly. 

“You live!” she cried. “You are 
well! How wonderful!” 

Memory came flooding back. He 
could not tell if it was wonderful 
to be alive; or not. He lifted hesitant 
hands to touch his forehead. There 
was a tenderness, but nothing more, 
to show where he had knocked him- 
self out. 

Gently Olga guided his hands 
away, and swabbed the patch of 
bruised skin with something cool 
and wet that diminished the pain. 
She had barely finished the brief 
task when there was a rapping sound 
from the far wall. 


She got up and took the three 
steps necessary to reach a sort of 
window, beyond which a stout mid- 
dle-aged woman with an expression- 
less face was making quick panto- 
mime gestures. As he rolled his head 
on one side to follow Olga with 
his eyes, Don saw her draw out 
from below the window a sliding 
compartment like those used in 
drive-in banks tb protect cash being 
paid over. From it she took a 
charged hypodermic. 

Once more the mishmash of tales 
about hypnotic drugs, secret poisons 
and ruthless espionage techniques 
flooded into Don’s muddled mind. 
But he was as weak as a kitten and 
could not resist as the needle was 
pushed expertly home. 

“It is good,” Olga said apologeti- 
cally. “It is for your health, you 
understand.” 

Don closed his eyes. 

Some hours went by between 
sleeping and waking. On two occa- 
sions someone came and went at 
the curious sealed window, and 
signalled for Olga to go to the 
drawer below it. The first time she 
took out some thin broth steaming 
in a tin bowl, and spooned it into 
Don’s mouth. The second time she 
took out food for herself. By raising 
his head a little Don was able to 
see that a faint violet glow pervaded 
the box, which disappeared a mo- 
ment after it was opened. 

Sterile? Presumably But — what 
for? 

It was not until the embarrassing 
discovery that Olga was not going 
to leave this cramped cabin for any 
purpose whatever, even the most 

89 


8INGLEMINDED 



private ones, that he began to think 
back over what she had said. The 
others would not speak to her. She 
was alone among nearly a hundred 
companions. Why? Surely she could 
not simply be insane, because then 
she would not have been trusted to 
drive out alone and fetch him from 
the wreck. 

He said, “What goes on? Please 
tell me! Why will no one talk to 
you? Why am I shut up with you 
like this when there are so many 
other people?” 

Olga clasped her hands before her 
in a kind of parody of delight, drew 
up her little stool near the bed and 
sat down close to him. She said, 
“Oh, it’s marvelous to talk again! 
Even in a foreign language it is 
good! You know, I have come to 
where I have made recordings of 
my own voice and played to myself 
so as to remember what it is like to 
hear, and listen.” 

“Why?” Don persisted. 

“The others are not talking now. 
I am the only one who is cured.” 

D on closed his eyes. This was 
too much. One sane person 
in a base full of lunatics? 

“Poor friend Don,” Olga said, 
laying her hand on his. “It is all 
hard to understand, isn’t it? Here 
is the beginning. Several years ago, 
in Soviet Experimental Biology Sta- 
tion of Raznoyansk, is discovered 
strange symbiotic virus with some 
affinity for the nervous system, 
especially the brain. They give it to 
some monkeys, and they get very 
intelligent, amazing! Then they go 
mad. But so intelligent it is wonder- 
90 


ful. I saw some of them who learned 
to use tools, who could even talk a 
few hundred simple words about 
food and working. It is decided by 
the great scientist Bielov, director of 
the ba$e, that he will experiment 
on himself, for it seems the virus 
increases mind activity. Changes 
readings on the encephalo — ” She 
stumbled, stressing the syllables odd- 
ly, and got it right the second time. 
“Encephalo-graph, yes.” 

Don listened passively. 'All this 
was a long way from the moon. 

“So in secret he infects himself 
with this virus that we call a reso- 
nating virus. It seems to respond to 
nervous activity as a sounding board 
to a tuning fork, do you know? As 
an amplifier. 

“Now I was apprentice — student, 
yes — with Bielov. One evening I 
am working with a friend, Dvoriov, 
in the laboratory where we have 
monkeys, and Dvoriov suddenly 
cries out that Bielov will kill him- 
self! Bielov is not there. He is at 
his house half a kilometer away, out- 
side the station. But we go, because 
Dvoriov insists, like a crazy man, do 
you understand?” 

She was getting violently demon- 
strative. The words poured from 
her, with wild gestures to emphasize 
them. 

“And he is taking poison, laid on 
his bed with a note by him! From 
half a kilometer Dvoriov knew . 
And that was when we discovered 
it was true, what Bielov said in his 
last note. This virus can create tele- 
pathy.” 

Don almost sat up. Only a stab 
of pain from his head made him 

IP 



fall back. Telepathy! With a tool 
like that the East would — 

“So all of us who had in any 
way been infected, Dvoriov, myself, 
many many more as well, were 
brought here to the moon, to this 
secret base, to work upon the anti- 
dote. We think we have it. We think 
so because it was tested on myself, 
and for many months now I have 
been well, and have not suffered to 
be able to read a thought in another 
mind. And that was what was given 
to you. This was why Dvoriov wore 
a spacesuit when he came into the 
moon-walker to us. Although I am 
now cured, perhaps, I still carry the 
virus, can still infect others. But I 
am sealed up here in the one room 
because I am the control study. It 
must be learned if the virus will one 
day die out in my body, do you 
understand?” 

Painfully, Don worked it out. 
Yes, it hung together. He could 
have been infected by Olga as an 
immune but a carrier, and had been 
given the antidote, so was now an 
immune carrier himself, and ... he 
had to get out of here! If he could 
just walk out, that would be enough 
to take the secret of the miraculous 
virus with hirti. 

Or was this all a big lie? 

O lga was going on, but he 
was scarcely paying attention. 
“Now all the others, you see, 
think together, and talk no more. 
I must talk again. Oh, I have been 
so alone since I was cured! Soon, 
when one year and a half is finished, 
and if I am still well, there will be 
more cures. But here it is a long 


way from other people, and our 
supplies come by automatic rockets 
and by robot vehicles And all of 
us are of high intelligence, so per- 
haps the others may not after all 
want to be cured. They work to- 
gether on many problems.” 

Don seized on that one. Telepathy 
would imply — perfect espionage, 
perfect teamwork in research, limit- 
less things! 

“When you fell down in your 
ship,” Olga hurried on, “it was much 
argued whether to rescue you. It 
was dangerous. But it would not 
have been possible to endure the 
knowing that you were dying, do 
you understand? Better to save you. 
Better also because without com- 
pany I would go mad, and though 
I have no longer power to receive 
thoughts all the others can hear me 
distantly as they heard you.” 

Once more she clasped his hand. 
It occurred to him that he would 
probably need a friend in the enemy 
camp. He returned the pressure. It 
wasn’t difficult. In spite of her 
mannish haircut and her rather dis- 
turbing eagerness to talk, she was 
attractive and female. Vague plans 
for exploiting these facts crossed 
his mind. In alarm, he checked 
them. It had just struck him that 
if he could be “overheard” at the 
distance of the crash, he could be 
overheard similarly and more easily 
now. 

What a fantastic situation to find 
himself in! 

“So you will help me to keep my 
mind well,” Olga was saying, “and 
this will be good for the others, and 
also you will be a control for the 


SINGLEMINDED 


91 



antidote, because if you do not be- 
gin to have telepathy it will prove 
it also immunizes, as well as cures. 
It is turning out so well!” she fin- 
ished rapturously. 

“What is it like to read people’s 
minds?” Don demanded. 

“So strange it cannot be ex- 
plained. It must happen to you. 
Blurred. Confusing. Sometimes 
frightening. Worst and most diffi- 
cult is when you are awake and 
near a person sleeping, for dreams 
are not logical. Almost they are in- 
sane. That is why now everyone 
here sleeps at the same time; we 
have our own artificial time, and 
all sleep from midnight to eight 
hundred hours. This is by hypnosis, 
that all go to sleep and wake up 
together. No other way is possible.” 

Click! Don tried to keep the 
thought unverbalized, at least, so 
as to reduce the chance of it being 
picked out of his mind. He said, 
“And — are they listening to me 
all the time?” 

“No, no! Much work is done, and 
they concentrate hard. I — or now 
you as well — we are like a little 
noise in the corner of a room. It is 
there, but you can forget it. To 
hear the tick of a watch at night, 
when your wrist comes near your 
ear, is easy, but after you wear the 
watch two days, three days, it is 
ignored, you understand? So with 
the mind you are not interested in. 
With many minds, it is much more 
difficult, for it is what you would 
call louder. Stronger.” 

So he could allow himself to 
think that it would be possible to 
escape as soon as he was well 
92 


enough, when the ninety or a hun- 
dred telepathic people here were all 
fast asleep together. And hypnoti- 
cally prevented from waking up 
for eight hours. 

IV 

I t was logical that they should 
become lovers. The confined 
conditions plus Olga’s desperate 
hunger for maximum companion- 
ship saw to that. Don had no par- 
ticular objection, except first that 
it seemed obscurely like treachery 
to have so much pleasure from it, 
and second that he could never help 
wondering whether there were 
eavesdroppers. 

There were regular deliveries of 
food, usually by the same middle- 
aged woman he had seen bring the 
hypodermic with the antidote just 
after he woke up. It seemed that 
that could have been automated. 
But it gave an opportunity for visual 
inspection of the control subjects, 
of course, and according to Olga 
that was why it was attended to 
personally. Twice a day he and she 
both had to offer a drop of blood 
from a finger to be taken to a lab 
somewhere else in the base. She did 
this skilfully for herself and for him, 
and he noted — not knowing wheth- 
er it was important, but taking 
everything in that he could — that 
the sterilizing ultra-violet did not 
play inside the sliding box when 
something was passed out of the 
room as it did when something was 
passed inward. 

Aside from that, Olga talked. 
Months of pent-up conversation 

IF 



flooded from her. Childhood mem- 
ories, descriptions of what it was 
like to be infested with the resonat- 
ing virus, funny stories, accounts of 
books she had read and shows she 
had seen, word-portraits of people 
here at the station before they be- 
came as they were. Don closed 
his mind to it firmly, as he had 
been taught. One could never tell 
when insidious propaganda might 
come through the harmless-seeming 
words. 

The other people in the base might 
as well not have existed except as 
shadows beyond the sealed window, 
appearing like the figures on some 
ancient mechanical clock at stated 
hours, going through their routine 
and vanishing again. But there was 
a world outside, and there was a 
secret of tremendous importance 
which he alone of all Americans 
possessed and which, if humanly 
possible, he was going to take away. 

H is watch had survived the 
crash, and still worked. The 
base was apparently run on an arbi- 
trary time — perhaps that of some 
Russian meridian — but it was easy 
to establish when the official “mid- 
night” fell; two-forty a.m. on his 
Greenwich-set watch. 

Disciplining himself with every 
technique he had ever been taught, 
he acted quite well enough to con- 
vince Olga within a few days that 
his gratitude for being saved from 
death had evolved into a genuine 
affection for her. It was unkind, he 
knew. But there was a deadly 
rivalry between west and east, and 
unless the secret of telepathy was 
S1NGLEMINDED 


shared it might be the long-feared 
decisive advantage which would 
give the enemy (the enemy since 
before Don was born, although 
there had never been a war in all 
that) the effective victory. 

Then, measuredly, he began' to 
make himself depressed and restless. 

The natural effect 'of being 
cooped up gave him a basis to work 
on. Soon he was snapping and com- 
plaining with convincing vigor while 
she wrung her hands and demanded 
what she could do. 

After a couple of days of that, 
he delicately broached the idea that 
they ought to be allowed outside, 
to save them from claustrophobia 
setting in. So what if it were not 
permitted? Was anyone to know if 
— just after midnight — one of the 
moon-walkers was taken out brief- 
ly, and returned before anyone woke 
up? 

Horror at the idea fought in 
Olga’s mind with her boundless de- 
sire to please her companion and 
not to be condemned to renewed 
loneliness. 

She voiced objections. Don dis- 
posed of them smoothly. He was 
enough of a technician to get around 
the alarms if she knew where they 
were. There could not be many, be- 
cause all the telepaths would be in 
hypnotic sleep. It would be impos- 
sible to wake just one of them be- 
cause of this difficulty with insane- 
seeming dreams picked up from 
sleeping minds. 

Three days’ argument produced 
the admission that there were no 
alarms or indeed locks to prevent 
Olga leaving her one room. There 

93 



had just been no reason why she 
should, until now. She had wanted 
to keep the experiment perfectly 
controlled. 

After over a year, Don count- 
ered, surely enough evidence had 
been gathered! 

On the fourth night, he won his 
point. 

H e had never been so excited 
in his life as at the moment 
when she timorously activated the 
remote control for the big lock 
through which the moon-walker 
entered and left the base, and sent 
it hurrying and scurrying over the 
plain as if anxious to get quickly 
away from the base where everyone 
slumbered, and all the alarms had 
been temporarily restored to their 
normal “daytime” setting. 

It was lunar night outside. To 
the radar senses of the moon-walker 
that made no difference at all. At 
a steady forty-k.p.h. clip it headed 
out across the black plain under the 
frozen stars. 

At his request, she showed him 
how to operate all the controls. 
Directly she had done so, he closed 
his fingers gently on her carotid 
arteries. 

As she fainted, he chuckled to 
himself. He felt extraordinarily 
proud* as though he had given her 
a much-needed lesson in absolute 
devotion to duty. He had been a 
little ashamed of himself for not 
cracking his suit when he saw he 
was being rescued by the enemy, 
and again when he found himself 
tempted to treat Olga with real 
tenderness. 

94 


But he had well and truly made 
amends for his weakness now. 

He bound and gagged her with 
strips torn from her clothing and 
placed her comfortably in the co- 
pilot’s chair. Then he studied his 
location. He had done some heavy 
thinking on the problem of naviga- 
tion, and he was fairlv sure he could 
strike straight across the plain to- 
wards Mrs. Rafferty’s Pass — that 
all-important gap between steep 
mountains which an irreverent 
spaceman had named. Beyond there, 
he would be in line-of-sight radio 
range of more than one American 
base, and could take his pick of 
the nearest. 

ft would be a long haul. But traf- 
fic in the lunar night was very 
sparse, and with a fusion engine 
under him the range was virtually 
unlimited. 

He occupied his time on the long 
trip with dreams of the glory await- 
ing the man who captured not only 
one of the fabulous moon-walkers, 
but also the incredible secret of the 
telepathic virus. When the eggheads 
set to work on that one, things 
would really blow off Imagine the 
lovely expression on Soviet faces 
as they learned of the loss of their 
secret weapon! 

He noticed eventually that Olga 
had recovered. He had expected 
her to struggle against her bonds, 
splutter foolish nonsense behind her 
soaked gag. But she did not. She 
merelv twisted her head and looked 
at him. 

For some reason, he could not 
meet her gaze for long. He dis- 
tracted himself by feigning cheer- 

IF 



fulness which was not altogether 
sincere. He said, “Sorry, Olga, 
honey! I’m afraid I never was the 
type to be romanced away from the 
call of duty. They teach you a lot 
about loyalty in the Service. Some 
of it sticks.” 

She said nothing. 

How could she, efficiently gagged 
as she was? 

Yet somehow a sort of deflating 
message seemed to reach him from 
her. As it might be put in words. 
Don't count chickens. It didn’t fit 
with his future plans, and he ignored 
it. 

He said nothing else directly to 
her all the time it took the moon- 
walker to reach Mrs. Rafferty’s Pass 
and come in range of an American 
base. As luck would have it, the 
first one he contacted was on a war 
footing. They made him stand by 
for six hours while they verified his 
identity by satellite relay half around 
Luna and made sure it wasn’t a 
Soviet trap. But they relaxed their 
over-cautious manner once they had 
men swarming over the machine 
and inspecting its mechanism, and 
in another hour or two he was in 
the presence of the base commander 
and pouring out his message. 

Again, the commander was sus- 
picious. But at length Don con- 
vinced him, and the application of 
a syringe of disinhibitor to Olga 
produced evidence to back him up. 
Within two hours more he, Olga 
and a heavy guard were on their 
way to America Base One, the 
nearest equivalent to a city any- 
where on the moon, for ferrying 
back to Earth. 

SINGLEM1NDED 


He had a wonderful time impress- 
ing the guards with the resourceful- 
ness whereby he had captured the 
moon-walker. The telepathic virus 
was of less interest to them. Ma- 
chinery they could see working. 
Viruses were a cold in the head. 

Still. 

On this trip, Olga was not gagged, 
only handcuffed to a stanchion, but 
she said nothing at all. She merely 
went on looking at Don. Some- 
times she smiled, and he didn’t like 
the smile at all. So he tried not to 
look at her. 

It took the better part of a day 
at America Base One to establish 
his claims to the satisfaction of the 
egghead staff. There were hasty 
conferences with the topmost brass; 
there were plans laid on for a vice- 
presidential welcome and other suit- 
able rewards for Don Bywater. And 
suitable treatment for Olga was like- 
wise arranged. 

“Congratulations!” said the base 
commander briefly, as the ferry to 
Earth was being fueled and raised 
on the launching ramps. He shook 
Don’s hand briefly. Photographs 
were taken for the record. 

V 

S omewhere along the line, some 
wires seemed to get crossed. 
When the ship had settled at Nevada 
Main Port there was quite a crowd. 

It cheered as Don emerged, wav- 
ing, straining a little against full 
gravity, but not as loudly as might 
have been. The vice president waited 
at the edge of the field for the 
buggy to fetch Don across. Don 

95 



went down to the little open vehicle 
with his personal escort. 

Then they brought Olga out of the 
ship. The cheering rose to a noise 
like Niagara. 

Disgusted suddenly with the whole 
business, Don had to make room for 
her in the buggy’s back seat. But 
to his amazement she was smiling, 
even at him, and with some sign of 
real pleasure at the welcome ar- 
ranged for them. The driver turned 
the buggy around and drove at a 
suitably slow pace across the con- 
crete toward the vice president, the 
cameras and the press. 

“Tell me, Don,” Olga said in a 
voice bright with false cheerfulness, 
“did you ever stop to wonder about 
some things?” 

“What?” Don was lost in worrying 
about what might happen in this 
ghastly situation, and about his 
tarnished glory. 

“Why Bielov killed himself, yes? 
And why it was necessary to take 
all of us to the moon and close us 
away from the whole world?” 

Don felt a block of ice form 
around his heart. 

“Think!” Olga invited brightly. 
“All on the moon at our base were 
clever, sensible people, high intelli- 
gence, trained scientists. All in- 
fected. Not .deliberately, by accident. 
For them, life is difficult but not 
bad. .. More were infected than are 
there now, but it was clearly neces- 
sary to insure that the stupid ones, 
the untrained thinkers, were ex- 
cluded. We know a lot, over our 
side of the world, about people in 
the mass. You also should know. 


People have lynched and rioted 
here, do you understand?” 

Don stared at her numbly. 

She turned and inspected the 
waiting crowd with a bright, hating 
look in her eyes. “Yes!” she said, 
and gave a nod. “People in the mass 
react strangely. They make less than 
the — what is it in English?” 

“The sum of their parts.” 

The gravelly voice was Don’s 
own, but it took him a while to 
recognize that he had spoken. 

“That is correct.” Bitterness col- 
ored Olga’s words. “I think perhaps 
I was sane till you exploited me — 
for loyalty, as you said. Now . 
perhaps not. But I think there is a 
good number of people here, enough 
to form well a mob ” 

Don’s mind seemed to have con- 
gealed now. To stop the buggy? To 
stand up and scream a warning? 

“Possibly there are some people 
here who dislike your vice president. 
Political people are easily hated.” 
Olga smiled a little crazy smile. “Do 
you think it would please the crowd 
if I persuaded the leader to kiss me, 
the pretty girl who has been brought 
to see error of her ways? Who would 
not know what loyalty means? You 
should know, Don.” 

P erhaps the antidote in the 
carriers’ bodies had made the 
virus more efficient at the business 
of infecting others. The crowd took 
ten minutes to become the mob 
Olga had predicted; within days it 
was the hemisphere that was in- 
fected, and in two weeks, the world.

H ave you ever seen a nematode? 

Probably not — and for the 
same reason people, especially in 
the season of the mortarboard, the 
graduation watch, and the platitu- 
dinous valedictory, can’t see the pro- 
fusion of new frontiers all around 
them. We don’t mean the New Fron- 
tier of foreign policy. We mean the 
ones worth dedicating a life to, cap- 
able of filling it with adventure, ex- 
citement, discovery and accomplish- 
ment. Do you really think there 
aren’t many of them around? If 
there were, you might be saying, 
why can’t you see them? 

Have you ever seen a nematode? 
Listen: 

If all the matter in the uni- 
verse except the nematodes 
were swept away, our world 
would still be dimly recogniz- 
able, and if, as disembodied 
spirits, we could then investi- 
gate it, we should find its moun- 
tains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes 
and oceans represented by a 
film of nematodes. The location 
of towns would be decipherable, 

NONPOilTICAl NEW FRONTIERS 


since for every massing of hu- 
man beings there would be a 
corresponding massing of cer- 
tain nematodes. Trees would 
still stand in ghostly rows repre- 
senting our streets and high- 
ways. 

That was written in 1914, in a re- 
port to the Department of Agricul- 
ture, by one N. A. Cobb, who ap- 
parently did discover a frontier, and 
who was followed by more nema- 
tologists — but never enough. It has 
been estimated that these amazing 
critters cost the farmer — and you — 
upwards of a billion a year. If you 
want to organize a safari to hunt 
nematodes, get yourself a shovel 
and step over to the nearest grass- 
land. In the top inch of one square 
yard of topsoil you can bag twenty 
million or more of them. 

A nematode is an eel-like animal 
seldom more than a twentieth of an 
inch long. It has a well developed 
nervous system and elaborate or- 
gans, and in one form or another it 
thrives in hot springs, Arctic ice and 
your own treasured personal plumb- 

n 




ing. Trichinosis is caused by nema- 
todes; so is hookworm. Among the 
many astonishing things about this 
little marauder is his — well, let’s call 
it chemical radio. 

T here is one nematode which lives 
exclusively on tomato plants 
and its close relatives. It lays its eggs 
and encapsulates them, and neither 
rain nor snow nor heat nor gloom of 
night has the slightest effect on this 
capsule. Nor time — at least, not 
much. If no tomato rootlets appear 
in the nearby soil, the capsule will 
lie there dormant for years on end. 
But as soon as the right plant sprouts, 
pop goes the capsule, the eggs hatch 
and nematodes swarm to the attack. 
(They don’t all hatch, by the way; 
having apparently bought an insur- 
ance policy, the nematode leaves a 
percentage of the eggs unhatched in 
case of crop failure. These can resist 
everything the capsule could, almost 
as well, plus temptation. No matter 
what, they’ll await another season.) 
The especially interesting thing about 
this is the chemical “signal” sent out 
by the plant, and the nematode’s re- 
action to it. It isn’t anything as gross 
as, for example, an acid which dis- 
solves the capsule. It’s a trace chem- 
ical so dilute that it’s indetectable by 
any but the most advanced lab tech- 
niques. The capsule isn’t opened by 
it; it opens itself when it gets the 
“message”, and it’s so sensitive that 
it will only respond to a healthy, new 
fast-growing rootlet. If the root is 
growing at a rate of 6/100ths of an 
inch a day it will then be left alone. 
Such a plant is weak and may not 
live. But if its growth is 8/1 00th of 

98 


an inch a day, pop goes the capsule. 
The chemical that brings this about 
is called a root “diffusate.” Hold on 
to that. 

The nematode has its enemies; 
prime among these is a tiny thread- 
like fungus. When no nematodes are 
present, these (there are several spe- 
cies) grow their fine tangled threads 
quietly through the topsoil like many 
others. But in the presence of nema- 
todes, the fungus — goes hunting! In 
a very brief time, the innocuous 
threads begin to manufacture traps. 
Some make flypaper, some fish- 
hooks; the most amazing of all 
makes a closed noose. Should a nem- 
atode put his head in the noose, it 
snaps closed — in less than one tenth 
of a second! 

Now, wha* triggers these traps is 
contact. What causes them to be 
made, however, and be ready in time 
is — you probably guessed it — a dif- 
fusate. So sensitive are these fungi 
to some trace chemical exuded by 
the nematodes that, if grown in a 
nutrient dish to which one drop of 
water in which the nematodes have 
lived is added, they will immediately 
begin to build traps. 

Here, then, is one of those fron- 
tiers. The composition and action of 
diffusates is poorly understood, and 
the man who can explain the process 
will have done more than make the 
acquaintance of a hookworm. For it 
is a diffusate which sends out the ir- 
resistible call from ovum to sperm — 
and sends the opposite message the 
very instant a single sperm cell pen- 
etrates it. And such understanding 
may make clearer the exact electro- 

IF 



chemical process by which a nerve 
impulse, which triggers cell after 
cell in microseconds, carries a mes- 
sage. There is simply no way to cal- 
culate the ultimate effects of such 
understanding. 

But if you feel a little cheated by 
our use of terms like “adventure” 
and “exploration” for such sit-down, 
eyestrain, trace-element researches, 
maybe the Para apricot, the vinca 
rose, aniba ' , pacova', and pajuru ‘ will 
be more to your liking. 

H ere is exploration and adventure 
in its truest sense, not only the 
exotic-land, pith-helmet, wild beast 
and deadly serpent variety, but also 
the pot-o’-gold kind; for here is ex- 
ploration with more than a fair 
chance of a classic buck at the far 
end. 

At last, and belatedly, teams of 
American and Brazilian doctors and 
biochemists are assaulting the Ama- 
zon Valley — an immense, largely un- 
charted tract carpeted with some 11,- 
000 as-yet-unclassified plant species. 

Everyone knows the story of 
curare , deadly arrow-poison which 
became a miracle drug. But did you 
know that along with quinine and 
ipecac, cortisone also comes from a 
jungle plant, and Brazilian Indians 
used to chew Rauwolfia to make 
them brave in battle, long before 
Mad Ave ever heard of Miltown? 
And they have 17 species of Rauwol- 
fia in those jungles, each valuable in 
its own special way. 


Doctors in the state of Para' found 
a high and tragic incidence of stom- 
ach hemorrhage a while back, and 
traced it to a local apricot, which wa* 
eaten plentifully by the people. From 
it they have derived a valuable anti- 
coagulent to control strokes and an- 
gina. (Let us add that our home* 
grown variety doesn’t play these 
tricks.) The vinca rose, common as 
our daffodils, is used in Brazil for 
a bracing tea, a mouth wash, an an- 
tiseptic for open wounds and a cure 
for upset stomachs. This year re- 
searchers haVe found that it is a 
potent aid in the remission of many 
types of cancer, including leukemial 
Pacova' and pajuru ' with which In- 
dians have been brilliantly painting 
their faces since before Columbus, 
may make a breakthrough in the dye 
industry the like of which has not 
been seen since coaltar appeared 
on the scene. Aniba! is a heady per- 
fume, and certainly the forerunner 
of a whole new series of exotic 
scents. 

We’ve been talking here only 
about one small corner of one sci- 
ence — biochemistry — and have, we 
think, uncovered a goodly number 
of challenging “new frontiers”. 
When you pause to think that with- 
out exception, every scientific dis- 
cipline can produce more of the 
same, the widespread ambition to 
shoot for Fringe-Benefitsville in good 
old General Everything Inc. looks 
just a little effete, doesn’t it?

ILLUSTRATED BY MODEL 


Whatever it was that had happened in the 
test, it badly needed a good explanation. 


I 

L ieutenant Colonel Philip Snow, 
Flight Surgeon, USAF, and 
Test Director of the Aero- Medi- 
cal Laboratory, was pacing the 
study floor in his quarters, asking 
himself for the dozenth time in the 
past half-hour: What had happened 
to Richardson during the test that 
afternoon? 

He was no stranger to problems. 
He had been living with them for 
the past few years, and they had 
been problems the like of which had 
100 


never before challenged the ingenu- 
ity of man. For he was the head of 
a small community of men, scientists 
like himself — medical specialists 
of all kinds, psychologists, electronic 
technicians, physicists, pressure engi- 
neers, mathematicians and so on, 
each one of them an acknowledged 
expert in his particular field — who 
had worked together with one end 
in view: to send a man into space 
and bring him back safely to Earth 
again. To put it more excitingly: to 
enable man to take his first step 
toward the conquest of the universe. 

IF 








The result of their labors to date 
was the Capsule, a bottle-shaped 
contraption which occupied the cen- 
ter of the laboratory floor. 

It wasn’t very big; just big enough 
to contain a man enclosed in a 
spacesuit, lying on a couch sur- 
rounded by instruments. But there 
wasn’t a square inch of the capsule 
itself, the spacesuit, and the instru- 
ments which hadn’t presented in- 
numerable problems, the solving of 
which had been the result of endless 
research and theorizing and testing. 

And in the same way, and almost 
to the same extent, there wasn’t a 
square inch of the man, too, which 
didn’t present problems, all of 
which must be solved before he 
could be sent into space. 

And so, in test after test, one of 
the chosen astronauts had lain on 
the couch in the capsule, wired 
through his spacesuit to the dozens 
of dials and graph recorders on the 
consoles at which sat the watching 
specialists. It seemed there was noth- 
ing that could happen inside his 
body that they could not know 
about. They could read every flex- 
ing of his muscles, every heartbeat, 
every tiny shifting of temperature, 
every reaction of his blood and of 
his complicated nervous system. On 
the encephalograph, they could even 
detect reactions in the mass of gray 
matter which was his brain, any 
sign of tension there, and above all, 
any symptom of that strange phe- 
nomenon of which so little was yet 
known, and which was called the 
“breakoff” — the eerie sensation of 
complete isolation from Earth, the 
trancelike apathy and indifference 
102 


to survival that can attack not only 
high-flying pilots, but deep-sea div- 
ers, “the rapture of the depths,” and 
sometimes it was accompanied by 
hallucinations in which strange 
forms and sounds were seen and 
heard. 

I n the case of Lieutenant Ham- 
ilton Richardson, USN, there 
had been no mysterious trou- 
bles of this kind — in fact, no 
troubles of any kind at ' all. Aged 
thirty-six, he had been one of the 
first of the astronauts to volunteer. 
He had passed with flying colors 
every one of the grueling prelimi- 
nary tests, mental and physical, and 
as far as could be judged by science, 
he had seemed to be the perfect 
specimen, mentally and physically, 
for the job. In the many tests made 
with him inside the capsule, nothing 
had gone wrong with him. There 
had been no signs of fatigue or 
failure of any kind. Had Snow been 
asked who, in his opinion, would be 
the first man — or, at any rate, 
the first American — to go into 
deep space, he would unhesitatingly 
have nominated Richardson. That is 
to say, until that afternoon when 
the thing had happened. 

It had been a long test, one made 
for the first time. The object of it 
was to find out how the spacesuit, 
which was sealed off from the rest 
of the capsule, would stand up if 
something happened to the capsule 
itself. If, for instance, in its head- 
long flight through space, something 
struck it, something, maybe, no 
bigger than a small pebble. The odds 
were that in collision with even so 

IF 



small a meteor, the shell of the 
capsule would be punctured, and 
within a minute or less, the atmos- 
pheric pressure inside it*, fixed at 
about five thousand feet above sea 
level, would be reduced to zero. In 
other words, the capsule would be- 
come a vacuum in which nothing 
on Earth could live. The astronaut 
would then have to depend upon 
his spacesuit which, being pres- 
surized, and being really a capsule 
within a capsule, with its own sup- 
ply of oxygen, would be the one 
hope of survival. 

That day, the test had consisted 
of the “puncturing” of the capsule. 
At a given signal, the pressure in- 
side it had been reduced to that of 
fifty miles above the Earth’s sur- 
face — in other words, to zero — 
by pumping out the air inside it. 
Richardson, the ace of the astro- 
nauts, had been chosen for this im- 
portant test. 

It had gone well. With the other 
scientists at their dials, Snow, seated 
at the big console of literally dozens 
of dials, the only one to be con- 
nected with Richardson by sound 
and speech, had given the signal. 
In a minute, the capsule had be- 
come a vacuum fifty miles above 
the surface of the Earth, outside its 
envelope of atmosphere. 

Richardson’s voice, reading his 
instruments, acknowledging Snow’s 
instructions, answering his questions, 
had come through as normal and 
as calm as ever. Snow had felt a 
rising excitement as the test pro- 
ceeded. 

And then, without warning, the 
thing had happened. Richardson’s 

ANOTHER EARTH 


voice had stopped in the middle of 
an instrument reading, as if it had 
suddenly been cut off. A few sec- 
onds later, it had resumed. Birt 
when it did so, the voice was utter- 
ing a stream of unintelligible soundi 
in a low, lilting chant. Snow had 
listened incredulously for perhaps 
thirty seconds, at the* end of which 
the sounds had suddenly ceased. 
Immediately, Snow had given in- 
structions for the normal pressure 
inside the capsule to be restored. 
Almost as he had done so, Richard- 
son’s voice, once again normal, had 
resumed the reading of the instru- 
ments, taking up from where it had 
left off a minute before. 

Acting on a sudden impulse. 
Snow had decided to say nothing 
over the wire to Richardson at the 
time. He had continued his conver- 
sation with the astronaut, telling 
him they were “bringing him down” 
and asking the usual questions until 
the test ended. 

W hen, with the others, he had 
stood around watching while 
Richardson was helped out of 
his spacesuit, he had carefully 
watched their faces, looking for 
some sign of doubt or puzzlement 
But he saw none. On the contrary, 
they all seemed triumphantly satis- 
fied. Even Richardson had shown 
no sign that anything unusual had 
occurred. He had been his usual 
cheerful self, seeming not even 
slightly fatigued by the long test. 

Being the only one who had been 
in contact with Richardson, Snow 
had suddenly found himself wonder- 
ing if he really had heard those 

103 



sounds, if, maybe, he had been the 
victim of a hallucination. This was 
why he had said nothing about it at 
the time. He had just asked, as casu- 
ally as he could, if any of them had 
anything they wanted to bring up 
immediately. They had shaken their 
heads, beaming their satisfaction, 
and he had dismissed them all, say- 
ing that in view of Jhe length of 
the test they might all call it a day, 
and postponing the usual interroga- 
tion until the morrow. Then he had 
hurried back to his quarters, bring- 
ing with him the recording machine 
on which, as was the practice, his 
conversation with Richardson dur- 
ing the test had been recorded. Con- 
trolling his impatience with diffi- 
culty, he had rewound the tape on 
the machine and played it back, the 
tension rising within him as he lis- 
tened. 

There had been no hallucination. 
He heard Richardson’s voice read- 
ing the instrument, the sudden cut- 
off in the middle of it, the short 
silence, then the voice uttering the 
strange sounds in a low-pitched 
chant with a gentle rise and fall to 
it. Three times he had played it 
back, and now it seemed to him that 
these were not just disconnected 
sounds. They appeared to have a 
cadence, a phrasing which indicated 
that they belonged to a language 
of some sort. 

Snow was no linguist. He had less 
than a fair conversational knowl- 
edge of French and German, and 
a scholar’s acquaintance with Latin, 
but he had travelled very extensive- 
ly in his time and had been accus- 
tomed to hear many languages 
104 


spoken. He was quite sure he had 
never heard anything even remotely 
resembling these sounds. Certainly 
Richardson was no linguist either. 
He was third-generation American 
from British stock, and all he knew 
about languages was what he had 
learned in school. 

T hen where had those sounds 
come from? Were they a 
language, and if so, w,hat did they 
mean? How could this happen to a 
man like Richardson without his 
knowing about it? Did it mean that 
here was, after all, something 
strange about him which the man 
himself might not even know about, 
and which might mean that he was 
not fit for the project? This last 
question worried Snow more than 
the others. 

He went to the telephone on his 
desk and dialed the Richardson 
bungalow. The voice of Richard- 
son’s pretty wife answered him. 
“Yes? Sandra Richardson here.” 
“Hello, Sandra. Phil Snow calling. 
Is Ham there?” 

“He’s in the shower singing his 
head off. Shall I get him?” 

“No, it isn’t important. I just 
wanted to ask him again if he feels 
all right after the test. I was rather 
a long one, and I wondered if he 
might feel tired, or. .” 

“Tired? He seems even more full 
of pep than usual. Was the test so 
very long, then?” 

“Yes, it was. That’s why I called 
and — just to tell him it was a suc- 
cess. I haven’t checked all the re- 
ports yet, but it looks good. And 
you say he’s as usual?” 


IF 



"Yes. Why? There wasn’t any- 
thing. .?” 

"No, no, nothing at all. Just as I 
said. I’ll be seeing you.” 

He rang off, hoping that nothing 
he had said was now making San- 
dra Richardson suspicious, and re- 
sumed his pacing up and down the 
floor. Now another question came 
into his mind. The same test would 
be run several times again before 
final conclusions could be made. 
Should he wait for them to see if 
this thing happened again before 
starting anything with Richardson 
and his colleagues? But even as he 
asked himself the question, he knew 
the answer. If this never again hap- 
pened in any future test, the fact 
would remain that it had happened 
once and could not be forgotten or 
brushed aside. It must be cleared 
up. Something had happened to 
Richardson’s mind. 

He decided to take Abe Fran 
stein, his head psychologist, into his 
confidence. As he dialed Franstein’s 
bungalow, he recalled with a sense 
of comfort that the brilliant little 
man was not only a world authority 
in his particular subject, but that he 
was said to be able to read, write, 
and converse in a staggering num- 
ber of languages, some of them ob- 
scure Oriental dialects. 

When Franstein answered the 
call, Snow asked him to drop in for 
coffee after dinner.

44T T Tell, I must say,” said Fran- 
▼ V stein as they sipped their 
coffee, "yours is the first glum face 

ANOTHER EARTH 


I’ve seen around here since that 
test this afternoon. Here we are, 
within sight of our goal at last, and 
look at you! Weren’t you satisfied?” 
"Before I go into that,” Snow re- 
plied, "there are a few things I want 
to ask you.” 

“About the test?” 

"In a way, but .principally about 
Richardson. Have you ever had any 
reason to suspect that there is any- 
thing unusual about him?” 

"In what way?” 

"In your line.” 

Franstein produced an enormous 
meerschaum pipe and proceeded to 
fill it from an untidy plastic pouch 
as he replied. 

"Yes, there is. One very unusual 
thing.” 

"There is?” 

"He’s got a very rare type of 
mind. It’s probably perfectly bal- 
anced.” The little man lit his pipe 
and continued: “The vast majority 
of us have some sort of imbalance, 
mentally. He hasn’t. When I say 
imbalance, I mean the sort of thing 
that makes for genius, a phenome- 
nal memory, an outstanding, effort- 
less talent, amnesia, any form of in- 
sanity, or even something like a 
violent temper. Anything, so to 
speak, overemphasized.” 

“Is it physical? I mean, does it 
have anything to do with the size or 
weight of the brain, or anything like 
that?” 

"You can take the brain of a 
genius and that of an ordinary per- 
son of average intelligence, and find 
them exactly the same in measure- 
ments and tissue condition. The 
popular conception of the genius as 

105 



a man with a bulging forehead is 
so much nonsense. Plenty of lunatics 
and retarded individuals have bulg- 
ing foreheads.’’ 

“Then what does it have to do 
with?” 

“Ah! That’s the big question. No- 
body knows. You can take two men, 
equal physically in every respect, 
equal in upbringing, education, 
health, and with the same sized 
brain. One of them might turn 
out to be a genius, the other an 
average individual, and nobody 
knows what makes the difference. 
Nobody knows what makes an in- 
fant prodigy, or what it is which 
enables a child of two to read easily, 
or a kid of five or six to play some 
instrument as if he’d been at it for 
years or compose symphonies, or 
master advanced mathematics. Same 
answer. Nobody knows. It’s got 
nothing to do with heredity. So few 
geniuses have had genius offspring 
that they form exceptions to the 
rule. Again, why does an infant 
prodigy sometimes lose his gift or 
talent entirely as he grows older? 
We don’t know. All we know is that 
the gift or talent is there, but where 
it comes from, or why it is in one 
brain and not in another, we don’t 
know. But surely you don’t have 
to have me to tell you all this, Phil? 
What’s on your mind?” 

“Listen to this,” Snow said, and 
went to the tape recorder. 

H e rewound the tape to its 
beginning, depressed the 
switch marked Play , and presently 
they heard the two voices, Snow’s 
and Richardson’s. 


“Nowl” said Snow as the point 
on the tape approached. 

There came the sudden stopping 
of Richardson’s voice in the middle 
of an instrument reading, the short 
silence, then Richardson’s voice 
chanting the strange sounds. Fran- 
stein took his pipe from between 
his teeth and his mouth fell open 
as he listened. The sounds ceased 
and Richardson’s voice resumed the 
instrument reading at the point at 
which it had left off. 

“That’s all,” said Snow, and 
switched off the machine. 

Franstein put his pipe back into 
his mouth. “Is this the recording of 
this afternoon’s test?” 

“Yes. What d’you make of it?” 
“Let’s hear it again.” 

Snow played back the recording 
a second and a third time, and then 
said: “Well?” 

Franstein went to the table and 
helped himself to more coffee be- 
fore replying. “It’s a new one on 
me,” he said presently. “I’ve got 
about a thousand recordings of 
languages and dialects from all over 
the world, and not one of them is 
anything like that.” 

“You think it is a language, not 
just sounds?” 

“That we’ve got to find out, but 
I’d say, offhand, it’s a primitive 
form of a language of some sort.” 
“Then how the devil does it come 
out of a man like Richardson who’s 
never spoken anything but English 
— nor his forebears, for that mat- 
ter?” 

Franstein shrugged his shoulders. 
“How does great music come out 
of a child of six, and so on? Same 

If 


106 



question, same answer. Nobody 
knows. Have you spoken to Rich- 
ardson about it?” 

“No. I rang his bungalow just be- 
fore dinner and spoke to Sandra. 
Richardson was in the shower, and 
she said he was feeling fine. I didn’t 
tell her about this, of course.” 

“Then it couldn’t have been some 
sort of mediumistic trance. They 
usually feel the effects of that soon- 
er or later.” 

“You’re not suggesting spiritual- 
ism, are you?” and in Snow’s voice 
was a note of amusement. 

“Don’t laugh at it. If it’s never 
been proved, neither has it been 
disproved.” 

And that touched off a discussion 
which went on for two hours. It 
covered many theories, many beliefs 
and faiths, all of which Franstein 
spoke learnedly and with great re- 
spect. He talked of reincarnation, 
spiritualism, the mystery of time, 
and in this last connection, he 
paused in the middle of what he 
was saying and asked: “If this — ” 
and he waved a hand toward the 
machine — “is a language, and I’m 
pretty sure it is, how can we be sure 
that it is a language of the past? 
Why shouldn’t it be one belonging 
to the future? All languages change 
with time. We’d probably find it 
very difficult to understand the 
English spoken ten centuries ago. 
What if this is the English that is 
going to be spoken a thousand years 
hence?” 

all of which Snow listened 
with the skepticism of the ex- 
act scientist, and Franstein, quick 

ANOTHER EARTH 


to notice this, went on: "You think 
yourselves clever, you exact scien- 
tists, and so you are. You can do 
a lot of things. You can split the 
atom, measure the stars, estimate 
the life expectancy of the sun; you 
have conquered distance, you have 
surrounded us with miracles like 
radio, television, invisible rays and 
all the rest of it. Presently, you will 
conquer space and colonize the 
planets, and so it will go until it will 
seem to you that you will know 
everything. And you will too, except 
for one thing — the one final mys- 
tery, the last secret of the universe 
— MAN. And that means you and 
me, and any human being from a 
bum of Skid Row to the President. 
Man is the eternal unknown quan- 
tity, and you’ve never had a more 
clear demonstration of this than 
what happened to Richardson this 
afternoon. Oh, I know what you’ve 
found out. You know all about man, 
his insides, his glands, muscles, 
nerves, brain, and so on. You can 
even display him on a table as a 
bucket of water and little piles of 
salts and minerals, and you can 
point to them and say: ‘That is what 
man is made of.* Only the other 
day I was reading about some scien- 
tist who thinks he’s on the verge of 
producing a cell of life in a test 
tube. You may even do that, and 
you may find out one day how to 
put the water and the salts and the 
minerals together again and make 
a man. I’ve always thought the 
Frankenstein story was a bit of in- 
spired prophecy. But you still won’t 
be able to explain why great music 
can come from a child of six, or

what happened to Richardson this 
afternoon.” He lit his big pipe, which 
had gone out, and through the puffs 
asked: “And what do you propose 
to do about Richardson?” 

“Run the test again tomorrow 
with him and see if this happens 
again, and then decide,” replied 
Snow. 

“But even if nothing happens to- 
morrow, you can’t ignore this.” 
“That’s true. We’ve got to get to 
the bottom of it, and that’s where 
you come in. You’re the expert on 
this sort of thing.” 

Franstein looked at his watch. 
“Let’s sleep on it and see what hap- 
pens tomorrow, eh?” 

He was on his way to the door 
when the telephone bell rang. Snow 
picked up the receiver, and he heard 
him say: “Sandra? . What? . 
I’ll be right over. I’ve got Abe Fran- 
stein with me. I’ll bring him with 
me. Don’t worry dear.” 

Snow hung up. “Something’s hap- 
pened to Richardson,” he said. “He’s 
gone into a deep sleep and won’t 
wake, and he’s talking to himself in 
some funny language. Let’s go.” 
Snow rummaged in a drawer of 
his desk and found a stethoscope. 

Ill 

F ive minutes later, they were 
standing with pretty Sandra 
Richardson at the foot of the bed 
on which Richardson, clad in his 
pajamas, sprawled on his back. He 
was in a deep sleep and from his 
mouth came a low chanting. Fran- 
stein and Snow glanced at each 
other as they recognized the sounds. 
108 


Snow tried to wake the astronaut, 
gently at first, then less so, but it 
had no effect. He used his stetho- 
scope on heart and lungs, drew back 
an eyelid and examined the eye be- 
neath, felt the brow. 

“When did this happen?” he asked 
the anxious Sandra. 

“About fifteen, maybe twenty 
minutes ago,” she replied. “We came 
in here and undressed and I used 
the bathroom first. When I came 
out, I found him like this.” 

“How’s he been all the evening?” 
“Fine, just as I told you when you 
rang. Tom and Betty Moreland 
came for dinner and we played 
canasta. Is he all right?” 

“As far as I can see, yes. Heart, 
lungs, eyes all right, no fever. I guess 
we’ll just have to wait till he wakes.” 
They went into the sitting room 
and Sandra left them to make 
coffee. 

“He’s living through something,” 
Franstein said. “Pity you haven’t got 
the recorder here.” 

“I thought the same. I’ll get it.” 
Snow left and Franstein wander- 
ed back into the bedroom and 
leaned over Richardson. Now he 
was sure this was a language and 
that the sleeper was conversing with 
someone in his sleep. The expres- 
sions changed on Richardson’s face 
rapidly as they do on the face of 
anyone during a conversation. At 
one moment he laughed as he said 
something, then became serious as 
he said something else. 

Sandra came into the bedroom 
and joined Franstein at the bedside. 
“He’s never been like this before,” 
she said worriedly. 


IF 



''Doesn’t he ever talk in his sleep?" 

“He never even snores. When we 
were first married, he slept so quiet- 
ly that I thought he’d stopped 
breathing, but I’d only have to 
touch him or whisper to him and 
he’d wake in an instant. What does 
this mean?” 

“We’ll find out, never fear.” 

They went back into the sitting 
room as they heard Snow return. 
He was carrying the recording ma- 
chine, and seeing the question in 
Sandra’s eyes as she saw it, he said 
reassuringly: “We’re going to make 
a recording of what Ham’s saying. 
We’ll soon find out what this is all 
about.” 

He busied himself changing the 
tapes on the machine, taking the 
new one from his pocket, and fum- 
bled the job in his haste. He had 
plugged in the microphone and was 
unwinding the long chord when they 
heard Richardson’s voice call out 
from the next room: “Sandra!” and 
a moment later, Richardson ap- 
peared in the open doorway, staring 
at them in astonishment. 

“Abe! Phil! When did you come 
here?” 

“About .half an hour ago,” Snow 
replied. 

R ichardson passed a hand over 
his eyes. “I must have fallen 
asleep,” he said. 

“You did, darling, and I couldn’t 
wake you,” Sandra said. “So I called 
Phil.” 

“You couldn’t wake me?” 

“No, and you were talking away 
in your sleep. You had me worried.” 
“Why?” 

ANOTHER EARTH 


Sandra, at a loss, looked at Fran- 
stein and he answered for her. “You 
were dreaming, Ham,” he said. 

Richardson thought for a moment 
before replying. “Now that you 
mention it, I was. But what’s so 
extraordinary about that? Why are 
you all looking at me as if I’d sud- 
denly grown horns?” * 

“D’you remember what the dream 
was about?” Franstein asked. 

“Vaguely. Yes, I do. It was just 
a dream. Why is it so important?” 
He sat down in a deep chair and 
looked around at them. “What is 
all this?” he said. “I fall asleep for 
half an hour, have a silly dream, 
and wake up to find you here look- 
ing as if something big has hap- 
pened.” 

“Something has happened, Ham,” 
said Franstein. “Something we don’t 
understand.” Richardson started up 
in his seat. “Take it easy, there’s 
nothing to worry about. We’ll get to 
the bottom of it.” He turned to 
Snow. “I think I know the way out 
of this. Play the recording for Ham 
to hear.” 

Snow hesitated for a moment. 
“All right, if you think so,” he said, 
and busied himself with the record- 
er, replacing the used tape on the 
spool. 

Sandra perched herself on the 
arm of her husband’s chair and put 
an arm about his shoulders. They 
waited while Snow linked up the 
end of the tape to the other spool. 
He pressed the Play switch, and 
presently there came the voices of 
Snow and Richardson. 

“That’s this afternoon’s test,” 
Richardson said. 

109 



Franstein nodded, and they con- 
tinued to listen Then came the 
chanting sounds, and when he heard 
them, Richardson’s expression 
changed to one of amazement. 
Snow switched off the machine. 

“What was that?” Richardson 
asked. 

“We hoped you’d be able to tell 
us,” Franstein replied. 

“I? What should I know about it?” 

“That was your voice, Ham. No- 
body’s touched the tape, and I 
heard it during the test.” 

“But this is crazy. How could I 
make a noise like that without 
knowing anything about it? Why, 
I remember every second of that 
test, and I know I didn’t do any- 
thing like that.” He jumped to his 
feet and began to walk up and down 
the room, his hands pressed to his 
head. 

“I said take it easy, Ham,” Fran- 
stein said. 

Richardson pulled up short in his 
pacing and turned to the little man. 
“How can I take it easy? I spend 
six hours in the capsule in a difficult 
test, remember every bit of it, come 
out of it feeling not even tired, and 
now you tell me that in the middle 
of it I had some sort of a blackout 
and made funny noises. That can 
only mean that there’s something 
wrong with me, and you don’t have 
to tell me what that means. I don’t 
qualify, after all. Is that what you 
came here to tell me?” 

F ranstein’s voice was as quiet 
as before. “It doesn’t mean 
anything of the sort. If there’d been 
a blackout or if something else had 

no 


happened to your brain, it would 
have shown up on the encephalo- 
graph, and nothing showed. I didn’t 
know about this until I heard the 
recording, and we weren’t going to 
say anything about it until we’d run 
the test a second time. Then Sandra 
called us to say she couldn’t wake 
you and that you were talking in 
your sleep, and we came over to 
find you in a sleep as deep as a 
coma and obviously di;eaming.” 
“And what’s that got to do with 
the test?” 

“You were making the same sort 
of sounds in your sleep as you did 
in the test, and I’m sure they add 
up to a language of some sort.” 
“What? You mean to say that was 
a language? For Pete’s sake, I’ve 
never spoken anything but Epglish 
all my life. I can’t.” 

“We know that.” 

Richardson turned to his wife. “Is 
this true?” he asked her tensely. 
“Was I making noises like that in 
my sleep?” 

She nodded miserably. 

He threw up his hands. “Okay,” 
he said, “you’re three to one. The 
ace astronaut turns out to be some 
sort of nut who talks monkey lan- 
gauge in his sleep, and when he’s 
awake too, without knowing it.” He 
went to the deep chair and slumped 
down into it. “What do we do now? 
Go into analysis again? Start all 
over?” He laughed shortly and bit- 
terly, and added: “Or do I resign 
from the project?” 

“Listen, Ham,” Franstein said. 
“We’re up against something new, 
something I don’t understand, and 
whatever happens, we’ve got to try 

IF 





and find out what it is, for your 
sake as well as for the project’s. 
Let’s relax and start with the dream. 
Tell us what you remember of it.” 
Richardson took time to calm 
down before he spoke. “It was just 
a dream,” he began presently. 
“There was a big spaceship and a 
lot of people standing about.” 
“Where was this?” 

“Where? I don’t know. On Earth, 
I suppose. Open place, you know, 
only ...” He paused before going on. 
“Only it wasn’t standing up on end 
like a rocket. It was lying on its 
side, and we were loading it.” 

“Who were ‘we’?” 

“My father and my two brothers. 
And that shows how silly the dream 
was because I haven’t got any broth- 
ers or father. My father in the 
dream wasn’t anything like my own. 
He was just an old man, and he 
told us where to stow the crates.” 
“What was in the crates?” 

“In the crates?” Richardson looked 
up. “Let me see now. Oh, yes, they 
were full of the seeds of plants and 
eggs and sperm of animals — sort 
of the beginnings of things.” 

“And where was the ship going 
to?” 

A gain, Richardson concentrated 
before replying. “To another 
Earth,” lie said. “That’s right. The 
old guy, our father, said that this 
one was going to be destroyed by 
some disaster, and the people stand- 
ing about were laughing and jeering 
and saying the old man was crazy.” 
“Do you know what sort of dis- 
aster was going to happen?” asked 
Franstein. 


Richardson looked at him and 
suddenly a smile formed on his face. 
“Now I know where that dream 
came from,” he said. “Remember 
that book On The Beach? The story 
about how everyone on Earth was 
wiped out by nuclear fallout? That’s 
it! I remember wondering when I 
read it if some of us would be able 
to go to another planet before any- 
thing like that happened here, and 
I remember thinking, too, that we’d 
probably take things like seeds and 
so on with us, and even the ova of 
animals, and that by then we’d prob- 
ably know how to preserve them 
— freeze them or something of the 
sort.” 

“We can do that now,” Snow said. 
“Well, there it is, then,” said Rich- 
ardson, smiling again. “There’s the 
explanation.” 

“It explains the dream all right,” 
agreed Snow, “but what about the 
sounds? Particularly those you made 
in the capsule?” 

“Lord, yes!” said Richardson, and 
the smile left his face. “I’d forgotten 
about those. That puts us back to 
where we came in, doesn’t it?” 
“I’m not so sure,” said Franstein. 
He got to his feet and, in his turn, 
prowled up and down the room, 
deep in thought. The others waited 
for him to go on, and presently he 
turned to them, a glint of excite- 
ment in his eyes. “I think we’re onto 
something,” he said. “Those sounds 
are obviously a part of your dream, 
Ham, including the ones you made 
in the capsule, and only you know 
what they mean.” 

“But I don’t even remember mak- 
ing them!”

IF 



“No, but your mind does. If we 
can unlock your mind, we can find 
the secret, and there’s a way in 
which it can be done. Hypnosis.” 
“Hypnosis?” The others spoke at 
once. 

Franstein nodded. “I’ve got to put 
you into a hypnotic trance, Ham, 
and we’ll play that recording back 
to you and I think — only think, 
remember — that you’re going to 
be able to tell us what they mean. 
Any objection, Phil?” 

“You’re the expert.” 

“How about you, Ham?” 

“I’ll do anything to clear up this 
business.” He jumped to his feet. 
“Let’s get on with it now. What do 
I do? Shall I lie down on the sofa?” 
“I didn’t know you are a hypno- 
tist too, Abe,” said Snow. “I’m not 
surprised, though. I might have 
known.” 

Franstein took no notice of this, 
lie stepped up to Richardson and 
looked up at him, holding out one 
hand which the other, wonderingly, 
took. “The big thing is confidence, 
Ham,” he said, looking up earnest- 
ly. “Complete confidence. You have 
that in me?” 

Richardson looked down on the 
little man and nodded his head. 
“Sure,” he said. “I’ve always had 
that in you, Abe.” 

Franstein continued to hold the 
other’s hand. “That’s fine,” he said. 
“All you have to do is to relax and 
trust in me. Just relax completely. 
Just let yourself go — eh?” 

R ichardson’s head nodded again, 
and for a moment Franstein, 
still holding the hand continued to 
ANOTHER EARTH 


look up into Richardson’s face above 
him. Then he released the hand and 
said: “Now you can lie down on the 
couch if you like.” 

Richardson went to the couch and 
stretched himself out on it. 

“I’ve heard a lot about this-,” San- 
dra said, “but I’ve never seen it 
done.” 

Franstein smiled at her. “You've 
just seen it done, my dear,” he said, 
and as she stared back at him in 
astonishment, added: “He's a very 
good subject. Now, when that ma- 
chine is ready. 

“If I’m right in what I think,” 
Franstein said a few minutes later 
to Snow, who stood by the table 
on which now rested the recorder, 
and to Sandra who was at the head 
of the couch looking down on her 
husband who lay there, his eyes half- 
closed, “you’re going to hear some- 
thing very surprising. Please don’t 
make a sound.” 

They nodded their heads, and 
Franstein seated himself on the edge 
of the couch, leaned over Richard- 
son, and spoke softly: “You hear 
me, Ham?” 

“Yes, I hear you.” 

“Then listen.” Franstein turned 
and nodded to Snow. The machine 
was switched on and there came, 
clearly, the chanted sounds of the 
test. They finished and the machine 
was switched off. “You heard. 
Ham?” 

“Yes, I heard.” 

“You made those sounds that we 
just heard.’ 

“Yes.” 

“Can you repeat them?” 



“Then do so.” 

And now the strange low chant- 
ing sounds streamed from Richard- 
son’s lips. Sandra put her hands to 
her mouth to stifle a gasp. Snow 
stepped to her side, his face tense. 

The sounds ceased and Franstein, 
his eyes alight with excitement, said 
softly: “Tell us, to whom are you 
speaking?” 

“To my sons.” 

“Tell us in English what you are 
saying to them.” 

There was a silence. Franstein re- 
peated his command, and Richard- 
son spoke again, this time in his 
normal voice. 

“And God saw the earth , and be- 
hold it was corrupt; for all flesh had 
corrupted their way upon the earth. 
And God said to Noah , I have de- 
termined to make an end of all 
flesh; for the earth is filled with 
violence through them; behold 1 
will destroy them with the earth. 
Make yourself an ark. .and you 
shall come into the ark , you , vour 
sons , your wife , and your sons ’ wives 
with you. And of every living thing 
of all flesh you shall bring two of 
every sort into the ark to keep them 
alive with you , they shall be male 
and female . Also take with you 
every sort of food that is eaten and 


store it up. .And Noah did all that 
the Lord had commanded him. .” 

The voice tapered off into silence, 
and Sandra, her eyes wide with fear 
and amazement whispered: “That’s 
the story of the Flood and he told 
it as if he was there. What does it 
mean?” 

Franstein silenced her with a 
gesture and bent over Richardson 
whose eyes were closed. “Ham,” he 
said, a note of insistence in his 
voice, “you hear me? Answer!” 

The eyes half opened. “Yes, I 
hear you.” 

“Tell me, where did you go in the 
ark?” 

“To a place of many waters. 
many waters, and we rested on 
them until they went down.” Now 
the voice was fading. 

“Where was it? Tell me, where 
was it?” 

The reply came in almost a whis- 
per. “I don’t know. It was another 
earth. .another earth. .” 

The eyes closed again, the breath- 
ing became deeper, but the lips still 
moved, and through them, barely 
heard in the tense silence, came 
again the low, chanting sounds. 
Then they, too, died away to silence, 
the lips ceased to move, and Rich- 
ardson slept. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 


Dear Editor: 

You will be astonished to get a 
letter from Germany speaking about 
If. So I have to tell you that I am 
a German sf fan and reader of sf, 
too. Today we have no sf magazine 
in Germany, but we had. It was the 
German edition of Galaxy, and it 
was a very fine magazine, but only 
a very few people bought it and so 
publishing ended soon. I wanted to 
know what is on with sf in America 
and the only way to get to know the 
new American sf literature is to 
read an American sf magazine. So 
I came to If, and I think If is 
good enough to show me something 
about your sf. 

First some critic of my second 
edition of If, the one of January, 
1963. I don’t like serials, and so I 
am not happy to have one in If in 
R. A. Heinlein’s Podkayne of Mars, 
but I think that my meaning has 
not enough weight to abolish it. 
One of the best stories of that issue 
is, I think, Gary Wright’s Captain 
of the Kali. It might be that G. 


Wright will become a good author, 
but one can see that he just has be- 
gun to write. He doesn’t know whe- 
ther he shall write more about the 
persons or the fiction. I think that 
the persons are more important and 
an author who can only describe ac- 
tion, but has no ideas how to de- 
scribe persons, is, as I myself think, 
no good author. But Gary Wright 
seems to become a good one. 

There are other good stories in 
that issue, but I think there is no 
wealth to count them up. 

I hope that I have shown you 
that there are friends of If also in 
other countries. Finally I have a 
question to you: Do you ever pub- 
lish stories of foreign authors? as 
German or French or other? 

With best greetings, 

Jorn-Dieter Bandermann

* Seldom if ever — because we see 
very few, and almost none that we 
think our readers would enjoy. But 
we’d be glad to print any good story

we can find regardless of origin. —

Dear Editor: 

Here’s congratulating you on one 
of the finest issues that I have ever 
seen in your history. The Jan. issue 
was simply superb! I rate The Five 
Hells of Orion as the best by far, 
one of the best novelettes of in- 
terstellar adventure that I have 
ever read. If you ever start a 
“classic reprint” department this 
story will appear in If as a classic 
of classics. The next best story was 
Captain of the Kali , by an author 
who is very promising, Gary 
Wright. I found this story to be an 
excellent blend of science fiction and 
good old-fashioned adventure. Next 
comes The Shipshape Miracle , by 
Clifford D. Simak. All in all, a great 
issue. 

Every time I turn to your letter 
column I see comments on your cov- 
er and interior art, usually bad. 
Lately these remarks are getting 
better, signifying that your art is 
looking up. However, I don’t give a 
darn whether your art is superb or 
crummy. When I buy If or any 
other sf magazine I look for good 
stories, and nothing else. 

I wish you came out monthly, 
though. Couldn’t you do something 
about that?

Dear Editor: 

The improvement in the January 
issue of If is welcome. Not one 
smudged or totally unreadable page! 

One trivial thing that irritates 
me no end is the utter lack of uni- 

HUE AND CRY 


form size in the magazine. The 
November issue measure 19x12.9 cm. 
The January issue measures 18 . 6 x 
13.5 cm. Of course I don’t ex- 
pect If to establish itself as a 
topnotch sf magazine (such as An- 
alog or Galaxy) overnight, but I 
don’t believe in stagnation, either. 

Who knows? If such improvements 
persist, I may even buy a subscrip- 
tion. 

Tell me more about Worlds of To- 
morrow. Clarke, Leinster, Silverberg 
and Laumer. Quite a lineup, if I 
may say so. One more question, then 
I’ll stop bothering you. Are you to 
become editor?

Dear Editor: 

In the first part of Podkayne of 
Mars, Podkayne states, “my waist is 
forty-eight centimeters.” Robert 
Heinlein is one of my favorite au- 
thors, but sixteen-year-old girls do 
not usually have waistlines of a 
little over twelve inches. What hap- 
pened, has Podkayne been dieting?

* A centimeter being .3937 inches, 
48 of ’em must come to — um — gosh 
— oh, say about nineteen inches, al- 
most. Svelte but not scrawny. Bet- 
ter get that slipstick fixed.' -

Dear Editor: 

The March If was the first ish 
I’d seen in a while, but what an im- 
provement! Neat cover by Finlay 
(ain’t he always?), neat layout, 

129 



neat illos, tinted headings, terrific 
yarns (an extra laurel for that dis- 
turbing bit by Ted White and Terry 
Carr). Wot next? Pulp size? No? I 
thought not. 

Know something? You’re rounding 
up the best, so try to latch on to 
Hannes Bok, R. M. Williams, Ross 
Rocklynne, Leigh Brackett, and/or 
James MacCreigh (for that I get 
Pohl-axed) . Also Bloch, Bloch, 
Bloch. Sure! 

I’ll be waiting with four dimes 
clutched in my sweaty little paw. 
Meantime I wish to heck someone 
would write to me.

Dear Editor: 

I’ve heard of an all one-author 
issue, but never before an all one- 
artist issue. Hats off to Virgil Fin- 
lay and Fred Pohl, boys. 

It’s good to see J. G. Ballard in 
your pages, but how about some 
more Britishers, say James White, 
Ken Bulmer, Philip High and so on?

Dear Editor: 

I protest! How could Heinlein 
squeal to a stop so soon when ob- 
viously, Poddy has a lot more story 


to her and so does Clark? Poddy 
ought to have made a pet of Ariel, 
flirted with a spaceship captain, 
proved her worth as a crewman in 
space and finally married Dexter. 
Please tell Mr. Heinlein to get busy 
on the sequel.

* Gosh, what do we need him for? 
You just wrote it ! — Editor 

* * 

* As friends of the family know, 
each issue we bring you at least 
one story by a writer never before 
published in a science fiction maga- 
zine. This issue there are two: An- 
other Earth y by a couple of fellows 
who have done all their previous 
writing in drama form, and Run - 
downy by a young public-relations 
man from upstate New York. How 
about the rest of you out there? 
It isn’t a contest; you don’t have 
to tear off a boxtop ; all you have to 
do is write a story and mail it to 
us along with a stamped, self-ad- 
dressed return envelope in case we 
don’t like it . 

Next issue: Retief is back, with 
what we think about the best in the 
series. We begin a new serial called 
The Reefs of Space by Jack Wil- 
liamson and your editor. And 
there’ll be more . 

See you then! 

Editor
