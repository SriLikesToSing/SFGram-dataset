Can Freddie Fong Fine save the world? 

If so, should he? 

If you have never asked yourself 
either of these questions, it is time 
you read SACRED LOCOMO- 
TIVE FLIES, in which Dick 
Lupoff does ask them. Whether 
he answers them is another mat- 
ter. Along the way, we encounter 
the Sacred Locomotive, the Israeli 
hyponuclear submarine Traif, the 
Phantom T anager ( and/or Cocka- 
too, etc.). Mavis Montreal the 
groupie, the enormous cavern be- 
neath the earth, Ali the lady Mars 
pilot, and other denizens and fea- 
tures of the world of 1985. And each thinking reader will ask himself 
more than once; “It could get this bad in only fourteen years? Or is it 
this bad now?” 

SACRED LOCOMOTIVE FLIES is a September Beagle book— and so 
are THE SECOND FONTANA BOOK OF GREAT GHOST STORIES 
and THE FONTANA BOOK OF GREAT HORROR STORIES-fan- 
tastic chillers by the top writers of this century. In October we have our 
Hallowe’en Horror Bash, with THE HORROR IN THE MUSEUM, a 
collection of H. P. Lovecraft’s collaborations with other writers; Lady 
Cynthia Asquith’s GHOST BOOK, the classic collection of ghost stories; 
John Brunner’s horror/sf/thriller THE GAUDY SHADOWS, and choice 
goodies from our Lovecraft, SF ghost and horror backlists. 

To come: THE TRIPS OF TOCK VON and further novels from Leo P. 
Kelley; more adventures of Summer of Muckrake by Ron Goulart; more 
ghost and horror-story collections. Also P. G. Wodehouse— could there 
be a new Fandom here?

THE EDGE 

T he aliens stood in clots, lean- 
ing and cuddling and nestling 
near the bar. A dark human with 
bristly black hair and long gangly 
arms faced them. The man’s eyes 
traced a path from alien face to 
alien face. His hands, held before 
him, shook. 

One alien laughed. His skin was 
the color of cold sea water, his eyes 
as dark as mountain lakes. He 
moved forward on three legs, still 
laughing, and stopped before the 
man, who bowed his head. 



The alien lifted a clawed hand. 
Slowly and carefully he struck the 
man across the face. The man 
bounded across the narrow room. 
His head struck the far wall. He 
bounced off the wall and landed on 
the floor. He lay on his back, un- 
moving. His eyes were open. The 
alien moved forward and stepped 
on the man’s face. 

The man did not speak. 

Many of the aliens at the bar 
were laughing, as were two other 
humans in the room. The alien 
glanced over his shoulder and 
joined the laughter. 

The dark man on the floor rolled 
over. His face was spotted with 
blood. He wiped some of it off with

the back of his hand. The alien 
reached into his tunic for a coin, 
tossed it across the room. It rolled 
into a pit, making a sound like a 
sponge being struck by a rubber 
mallet. 

The dark man turned his eyes on 
the alien, watching him open his 
tunic, walk to the edge of the pit 
and make use of it. 

The dark man began to crawl. 
He pulled himself across the floor, 
using his knees and elbows. He 
peered into the pit. 

No one was laughing now; all 
eyes watched the dark man and the 
pit. 

The man moved his right arm. It 
slid down into the pit, twitching. 



the fingers shaking, opening and 
closing as if grasping at the mole- 
cules of air. 

A big man came through the 
doorway. He looked at the pit, 
shook his head and strode for- 
ward. He raised his foot, stepped 
on the dark man’s arm. 

For a moment the hand co'n- 
tinued to twitch. Then the dark hu- 
man turned and looked at the big 
man. His lips formed a word 
soundlessly. Bastard. 

The big man reached down and 
with both hands lifted the dark 
man into the air. He threw him 
away from the pit, then turned on 
the laughing alien. 

The alien stopped laughing. 



THE EDGE ANDTHEMIST

T he dark man lay on the floor. 

Suddenly he rose to his feet. He 
sprinted forward, grabbing a 
chair as he ran. He lifted the chair 
and dropped it solidly across the 
big man’s shoulders. The big man 
fell, rolled to his knees, shook his 
head and dropped on his face. 

The dark man stood over the big 
man. The broken chair dangled in 
the dark man’s fist. 

“You son of a bitch,” he spat 
at the motionless big man. 

The alien was laughing again. 
He came forward, pushed the dark 
man out of his way and crouched 
beside the big man. He went 
through the man’s pockets care- 
fully. He removed some bits of 
paper and a few coins. He waved at 
two aliens who stood at the bar. 
They joined him and the three of 
them began to pull the big man to- 
ward the door. 

The big man came awake and 
lashed out with both feet. Two of 
the aliens went down. The third 
took a blow to the face as the man 
rocked erect. A few at the bar 
jumped forward. Some held 
knives. 

The big man backtracked until 
he stood against the wall. 

The aliens continued to close in. 
The one who had laughed led the 
pack. He was no longer laughing. 
A trickle of blood ran from one 
corner of his mouth. A light and 
tinkly music came from the bar 
and infiltrated the incipient vi- 
olence with mock serenity. 



The dark man said, “Stop.” 

He stood behind the aliens, a gun 
in his hand. One of their number 
lay unconscious on the floor, an 
empty holster around his waist. 

The dark man said, “Get over to 
one side — all of you.” 

The aliens moved away from the 
gun. The big man picked a knife 
from the floor and joined the dark 
man. 

He said, “Thanks.” 

The dark man said, “Yeah.” 
Together they eased toward the 
door. It dilated and they went out. 

On the other side they waited. 
Almost immediately the door 
began to open. The dark man fired 
a charge through it. The door 
slammed shut. 

“Ought to keep them,” said the 
big man. He reached into his tunic 
and pulled out a narrow cigarette. 
He put it between his lips and 
puffed. The cigarette ignited and 
he handed it to the dark man. “Try 
this, Quinn. Calm your nerves.” 
“You want me with calm 
nerves?” Quinn puffed on the ciga- 
rette. Its fumes were pink and fra- 
grant. 

“We’re going out,” the big man 
said. 

“Who’s we?” 

“Me. Deak. And you.” 

“You want me?” 

“You were good once. I can’t 
find any who’re good now. You’ll 
have to do.” 

“Thanks. A madman, a cripple, 
a toxer. That’S all?”

GALAXY 




“That’s all.” 

Quinn stepped on the cigarette. 
“Give me another. When do we 
go?” 

“Four or five days. I got a ship 
today.” 

“Enough time for me to crack it, 
right?” 

“If you want to bad enough.” 
Quinn dropped the second ciga- 
rette, half-smoked. “These things 
give me a headache. Hawkins, 
you’re a bastard.” 

“I always was,” Hawkins said. 

T he edge was what everyone 
always called it. Never was it 
known by its more rightful and 
proper designation: 3D7698. The 
Edge was what everyone called it 
for two reasons. The first rea- 
son was simply that it had orig- 
inally been designed by a man 
named Edge. Jacob Andre Edge 
was long since dead and gone, but 
back then, at the beginning, he 
had been the man who designed 
3D7698. The second reason for 
the appellation was that the Edge 
was an artificial planet, large 
enough to support a population 
of a half-million, circling the gal- 
axy, but outside of it — at the edge, 
the brink, the end. And so: the 
Edge. 

The boy was called Alpha and 
for one simple reason: that was 
his name. He rode the corridors 
of the Edge, his destination firm- 
ly in mind, his contact lenses 
tinted a deep shade of violet — a 



young man, actually, say about 
twenty-one, with blond wavy hair, 
a lanky lean build, thick lips and a 
face young and flat, untouched by 
the lines of hard living that char- 
acterized most human faces 
around him. He rode the corri- 
dors, looking neither to the left 
nor right, passing people and 
aliens, but none stopped to greet 
him, to say hello, for none knew 
him. He had lived a day and a half 
on the Edge and that time had been 
spent asking questions and pump- 
ing hands but not making friends 
or even enemies, for Alpha was a 
man (or boy) with a job to be done 
and a job to be found and he had no 
time for all the extras. Maybe 
when he was older. Perhaps then. 
But not now. Not yet. 

Alpha jumped off the moving 
corridor and stood in front of a 
door. He lifted his face and al- 
lowed himself to be scanned. The 
door dilated and he passed 
through it. Immediately he put 
his hands on top of his head and 
froze. 

Two men were in the room. One 
was big as a space cruiser with a 
long red crease — probably a heat- 
gun scar — running along one 
cheek. He held a heatgun in his 
right fist. It was pointed at Al- 
pha’s belly. The second man was 
small and old. He sat, grinning in- 
to Alpha’s eyes. 

The first man asked, “And who 
the hell are you?” 

“Are you Hawkins?”

“That’s my name. What’s 
yours?” 

“Alpha. May 1 sit down?” 

“No. What do you want?” 

“I want to talk to you.” 

The old man said, “He’s all 
right. Look at him. The way he’s 
dressed, the way he stands. He 
hasn’t been on-planet a week.” 
Hawkins frowned and said, 
“Shut up, Deak.” 

“No,” said the old man. 

Hawkins looked back at Alpha 
and said, “Well — talk.” 

Alpha started to reply. But 
where was it — the speech he’d so 
carefully prepared back home, 
the one he’d just finished re- 
hearsing for the nine-hundredth 
time? What had happened to it? 

At last he said, “I’m not 
armed.” 

“I know that,” Hawkins said. 
“The door told me.” His voice 
echoed strength and a lot of living. 
And wisdom, too. Alpha thought, 
and glory. This is him; this is Haw- 
kins. “What I want to know is 
what you want.” 

“I want a Job,” Alpha said 
weakly. “With you.” 

The old man, Deak, laughed. “I 
told you,” he said. “I knew it.” 
“Shut up, Deak. Who sent you 
here?” 

“Nobody sent me.” 

“Don’t lie to me. Somebody 
had to. I don’t advertise for 
help.” 

“Well — there was my mother. 
She—” 



“Your what?” 

Deak was laughing again, 
shaking, waving his hands, slap- 
ping his thighs. 

“He said, his mother.” 

“She knew you once,” Alpha 
said. “She told me about you. Her 
name was Leona Carse. From 
Hickley. Don’t you — ” 

“1 remember her,” Hawkins 
said. 

“She used to talk about you all 
the time and she always said you’d 
help me when I needed help and 
you’d put me up when I needed 
that. I’ve heard your name ever 
since I was a kid, ever since I was 
old enough to listen and under- 
stand.” Deak had stopped laugh- 
ing; now he was listening. “She 
died last month and left me Just 
enough credit to come here. It took 
a while, hopping from planet to 
planet. They say you’re going to 
try to crack the Mist. I want to 
go along.” 

“You’re out of your mind,” 
Hawkins said. He pointed at a 
chair and Alpha sat down. 



<< O OUNDS like an honest story 
to me,” Deak said. 

“Nobody asked for your 
opinion. How old are you? 

“Twenty-seven,” Alpha said. 

“And you want to try to crack 
the Mist?” 

“My mother said you were only 
twenty the first time you went out 
there.”

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

“That was different. People 
grew up faster then.” 

“Give me a chance.” 

“You ever been in a cruiser? Ex- 
cept as a passenger?” 

“No, but you need one man like 
that. Somebody to do the dirty 
work, cleaning up. The experi- 
enced men will be needed else- 
where.” 

“Deak’s going to do the dirty 
work.” 

“Not me,” Deak said. “I’ve got 
more experience than any other 
three men. I’ll be one of them 
that’s needed elsewhere.” 

“Shut up, Deak.” 

“Are you going to take this boy 
along? You know vye need anoth- 
er hand. Considering.” 

“No,” Hawkins said. “I’m not 
taking him.” 

Deak rose to his feet and walked 
toward Alpha. He walked with a 
limp, leaning toward the right, 
and when he passed the table Al- 
pha saw that his foot was missing. 
The boot at the end of his leg was 
empty. 

“Come on with me,” Deak said. 
“Mr. Hawkins has things to do.” 
Deak led him to the back of the 
room. A door dilated shut behind 
them and they were in a large bed- 
room. 

Deak said, “You can stay here. 
Sleep here till we’re ready to 
move.” 

“What about what Hawkins 
said?” 

“Never pay any attention to 



what Hawkins says. He never 
means it anyway. That’s why he 
keeps me around; to explain to 
people what he’s thinking. He 
wants you to stay. He remembers 
your mother same as me.” 

“You knew her?” 

“Sure, all of us knew Leona. 
Here — sit down and I’ll tell you 
about it.” 

Alpha sat on a bed and Deak 
took a seat across from him. A 
third man was in the room. He was 
lying on one of the beds, flat on his 
back, eyes closed. He had thick, 
dark, curly hair and a smile on his 
lips. His mouth was open and he 
was snoring. 

Deak said nothing about the 
third man. He said, “I was still a 
captain back then. Hawkins was 
with me. Just him and me, going 
from planet to planet, running a 
private shuttle, and on one of 
them we met your mother. I fell in 
love with her instantly, but it was 
Hawkins she liked. Couldn’t blame 
her. He was younger and bigger 
and smarter and a lot more fun. 
The three of us went everywhere 
together and when it came time to 
move on she went with us. I was the 
captain but I couldn’t very well 
say no. Not that I wanted to.” 

Deak’s story continued to an- 
other planet, rambled about these 
aliens and how Hawkins did this 
and Leona did that and how she 
was right all along. The story took 
a long time to tell but it was a good 
one.

GALAXY 




“Those were the five best years 
of my life,” Deak said. “Hawkins’, 
too, I imagine. When Leona said 
she was through, that she was go- 
ing back home, well, we came out 
here and Hawkins hasn’t thought 
of a thing since except that blanket 
of mist out there. Me, I’ve got hob,- 
bies and old age to keep me occu- 
pied. Hawkins has got the Mist and 
that’s all. But I’m glad you’ve 
come. For a long time it’s just been 
me and Hawkins and Quinn — ” he 
pointed at the sleeping man — “but 
I know it’ll never be the same 
again, even with you here.” 

Alpha said, “Tell me about 
Hawkins.” 

“You don’t know about him? 
What’s there to tell that’s not 
known by half the galaxy?” 

“What about the Mist?” 

“Not much to tell there, either. 
Hawkins was the first to prove 
definitely that it circled the 
galaxy, that it was a fence around 
our cage. Ever since then he’s 
wanted to break out of the cage.” 
“And who’s he?” Alpha pointed 
at the sleeping man. 

Deak laughed. “His name is 
Quinn. He’s the assistant com- 
mander. Three-man crew and 
we’ve got a commander and an 
assistant. Four-man crew now — 
with you.” 

“Ishe— ” 

“Toxed. Sure. Quinn’s always 
toxed now. He used to be good, but 
that was before he died.” 

“He doesn’t look dead.” 



“He’s not — now. He went into 
the Mist and when you go into the 
Mist things happen to you. What 
happened to Quinn was that he 
died and stayed dead for five days. 
He’s never said what it was like. 
But he’s been toxed ever since.” 
“And you still use him out 
there?” 

“Sure. It doesn’t seem to bother 
him and he was good once. That’s 
what matters.” 

“I see.” 

“Sure you do.” Deak stood. 
“Well, you must be tired. I’ll let 
you get some- sleep. Don’t let 
Quinn bother you.” 

And he left. 



II 

W HEN DEAK emerged from 
the back bedroom he was grin- 
ning widely and chuckling gently. 
He liked the boy, was pleased to 
have somebody around who 
hadn’t yet grown sick of hearing 
his old stories, who wouldn’t im- 
mediately tell him to shut up. 
Deak liked the boy a lot and Deak 
was the kind of man who, when he 
liked someone or something, 
liked for keeps. 

He sat down at the table in the 
middle of the room, after first 
checking the door, making sure 
the scanner was set and that the 
right reception was ready in the 
event of visitors. He thought about 
calling Hawkins -down at the 



THE EDGE ANDTHEAAIST

tubes but thought better of it. 
Nothing important had hap- 
pened yet and if Hawkins wanted 
him Hawkins would call. 

“I’m old,” Deak muttered, 
thinking, then laughed. He 
reached into the table and re- 
moved his film collection. 

If anything had helped him sur- 
vive the inactivity of age this was 
it. He knew it was wrong for him to 
still be living. Ninety-two was a 
good age for inactive men, for 
buttcrushers and Fed peepers, 
but it was bad for a man like him. 
He tried to imagine Hawkins at 
the age of ninety-two, tried casting 
his mind fifty years into the fu- 
ture. But it couldn’t be done. Haw- 
kins was a perpetual forty-year- 
old. When Deak had first met him 
Hawkins had been twenty phys- 
ically and forty spiritually and in 
the years past his physical age had 
merely caught and surpassed his 
spiritual age. The latter had re- 
mained the same. 

Deak removed a film from the 
case and placed it gently into the 
viewer. He was careful with it. 
The print was easily a couple of 
hundred years old — probably 
more. Deak knew he ought to have 
it reproduced, but he liked it this 
way — old and musty and nearly 
falling apart. All of his prints were 
old. Many had already disinte- 
grated on him. But he didn’t care. 
Soon it would be his turn to dis- 
integrate and then none of it 
would matter any more. 



He put his eye to the viewer and 
watched another time unfold. He 
knew the film by heart. There were 
these fellows in a place called the 
Argentine and they were flying 
aeroplanes through the atmo- 
sphere of Old Earth. One of them 
was going blind and another 
shrugged in the face of death and 
there was a woman. It was the 
woman Deak most appreciated in 
this one. She was (he often let 
himself think) Leona — and the 
young guy was Hawkins and the 
old one, the one going blind, that 
was him. There was even a part for 
Quinn. It all fit. Deak loved these 
old things. They were all he had left 
to love. 

The door dilated and Deak 
jumped. Four men came fast into 
the room and the fat one said, 
“Stand where you are.” 

Deak stood. 

“Where’s Hawkins?” 

“He’s not here. How — ” 

“I run this place,” the fat man 
said. “When 1 want to get into 
a cabin, I can do it. Now tell me 
where he is.” 

“Who was that?” said Deak. He 
recognized the fat man now. His 
name was Nyby and he was Feder- 
ation governor for the Edge. One 
never saw too much of him de- 
spite his big title, and this time he 
had three men with him. The men 
were carrying guns. 

“Hawkins,” said Nyby. “Who 
do you think?” 

“He’s down in the tubes.”

GALAXY 




“We’ll wait for him. I have 
something I want to show him.” 
Nyby turned to one of his men. 
“Go see if there’s anyone else 
here.” 

The man headed for the back. 
Deak sat down at the table and 
said, “Another warrant? You’re 
wasting your time. Hawkins 
doesn’t care about paper orders. 
When he wants to go, he’s going.” 
“I’ve got something more effec- 
tive this time. Where he’s going is 
into custody.” 

D eak said nothing. The man 
came out of the back room. Al- 
pha walked ahead of him. Quinn 
came next, rubbing his eyes and 
yawning. 

Quinn said, “I told you not to 
wake me up till I wanted up. What 
kind of alarm is this guy?” 

He pointed at Nyby. 

“He’s got a warrant to put Haw- 
kins into custody,” Deak said. 

“Fat fool,” Quinn said. He sat 
down on the floor and grabbed his 
head. He moaned once, then 
looked at Deak. “Where is he?” 
“Tubes.” 

Quinn looked right at Nyby and 
said, “Fat fool.” He jerked his 
head at Alpha. “Who’s this?” 

Deak explained and Quinn 
nodded. They talked as if they were 
alone in the room. Nyby began to 
fidget impatiently. 

Quinn asked, “What are you 
viewing?”

folk. Reissues of Bradbury. And of 
course Lovecraft. (What is with Love- 
craft? We've all known he was good, 
if specialized, for lo, these many 
years. The bounce in sales his works 
are getting can't all be coming from 
a lunatic fringe. At least we hope not 
or there are more of them around 
than makes for easy nights.) By con- 
trast, a delightful jape by (of all peo- 
ple) G.K. Chesterton, THE MAN 
WHO WAS THURSDAY. And in July 
also, a full length novel based on a 
Galaxy novelette by T.J. Bass, HALF 
PAST HUMAN. Unnerving. A comer, 
that one. Get in on the ground floor. 
Also a rich, weird, wonderful novel on 
a related theme (over-pop), CANDY 
MAN, by Vincent King.

IN this, the year of Larry Niven, Au- 
gust sees a novel by DaveGerrold and 
Larry, THE FLYING SORCERERS, 
featuring that lovable fellow Shoo- 
gar, whom you first encountered in 
If. The sales department has it that 
funny sf covers don't sell, so it's not a 
funny cover. (But it's very good.)

And it's a very tunny book. We hope 
you got your copies of RING- 
WORLD, PTAAVS, A GIFT FROM 
EARTH and NEUTRON STAR. It's our 
bet you'll need them at the Con in 
September. 

• 

We are especially delighted to 
note that Hal Clement's novel STAR 
LIGHT is high up there on the Hugo 
nominee list. We'll be doing it in 
September — just might have copies 
ready for the Con. But back to the 
present .

THE month of August is distinguished 
by the publication of THE CHILDREN 
OF LLYR, by Evangeline Walton, the 
lady whose previous title in our Adult 
Fantasy series evoked an enormous 
response (THE ISLAND OF THE 
MIGHTY). And rightly so. She is a 
powerful writer. LLYR, an original 
based on the Second Book of Mabin- 
ogian Welsh mythology, is a tragedy 
of the gods told in prose so distilled it 
is close to poetry. The style is com- 
pletely different to that used in the 
earlier book and completely at one 
with the stark subject. Congratula- 
tions, Miss Walton. You are an hon- 
ored and most welcome guest in our 
house. BB 



“Angels ” said Deak. 

“Get to the death scene yet?” He 
turned to Alpha. “Ever seen that 
one? Must be three hundred years 
old.” 

Alpha said no. 

Nyby said, “Shut up. All three 
of you. I don’t want Hawkins 
alerted.” 

Quinn asked, “Why? Isn’t it me 
you’re really after?” 

Nyby shook his head wordlessly. 

Quinn pressed the point: 
“You’re after the chance to kill 
me. It’s as simple as that, right? 
You don’t care about Hawkins or 
these others.” 

Deak grinned, listening. He re- 
membered now about Quinn and 
one of Nyby’s wives — or was it 
daughters? Yes, that was it: one of 
his daughters. Nyby was a prude; 
he had only one wife. It had been 
the daughter, down in the pits, 
screaming and shouting at her 
father in front of a few hundred 
witnesses, half of them aliens, and 
Quinn rolling in the sawdust, 
laughing. 

Nyby looked at Quinn and said, 
“Shut your mouth.” 

Quinn said, “Fat fool, why don’t 
you get out of here? She wasn’t 
worth my time anyway.” 

Nyby glared. 

Quinn said, “Not worth a bug’s 
time — ” And Nyby came forward. 
He slapped Quinn across the face. 
Quinn’s head snapped back and he 
fell. When he rose there was blood 
on his teeth.

GALAXY 




Deak grinned. Not at the blood; 
not at Nyby’s raging face. He 
grinned at what he saw from the 
corner of one eye. The boy was 
moving on light feet. 

Alpha’s arm dropped and the 
gun hit the floor. 

Deak ran, scooped up the wea- 
pon and trained it on Nyby. “First 
to move is a dead man.” 

Nobody moved. 

Quinn wiped the blood from his 
lips and grinned. He said, “We’re a 
team.” 

Deak tossed him the gun. “I’m 
going to call Hawkins. They’re all 
yours.” 

Quinn nodded and went over to 
Nyby. The fat man cowered, anti- 
cipating the blow. It never came. 

Quinn said, “Strip.” 

Deak grinned from the phone. 
Nyby was a prude. Nudity to him 
was something shameful, like a 
display of cowardice to a normal 
man. 

Nyby removed his clothing. 
Naked he appeared even fatter 
than clothed. Deak completed his 
call and Quinn tossed him the gun. 

He said, “Take him home by the 
most public route you can find. I’ll 
give you ten minutes before I re- 
lease the others. Then I’m going 
to go back to bed. Don’t wake 
me.” 

Deak waited for Quinn to ob- 
tain another weapon, then pushed 
Nyby out. They hopped a cor- 
ridor. Nyby kept his eyes down. 
Four women rode past, young. 



nearly naked themselves in noth- 
ing but spangled strings. The 
women looked at Nyby, recog- 
nized him, waved and laughed. The 
fat man’s color went from light 
scarlet to deep flushed crimson. 

Deak said, “It’s a long way 
home.” 



D eak and Nyby had been gone 
ten minutes. Quinn looked at the 
other three men and said, “Go 
home and don’t stop anywhere 
you shouldn’t.” 

The men departed hastily. 

Alone with Alpha, Quinn 
dropped to the floor and grabbed 
his head. He began to moan soft- 
ly- 

Alpha watched him. He had 
wondered why Hawkins wanted a 
toxer in his crew. Now he knew. 
When Quinn wanted to be good no 
one was better. 

Alpha said, “Can I get you any- 
thing?” 

Quinn looked up, shook his 
head. “It’s not bad now. It comes 
and goes. I can sleep. Besides, I’m 
used to it. Later I might need 
some help. But you can do one 
thing for me — tell me who the hell 
you are.” 

“Deak told you. Don’t you re- 
member?” 

“I remember. Deak doesn’t be- 
lieve your story any more than I do 
but unlike me Deak is a gentle- 
man. He doesn’t say liar to peo- 
ple’s faces. Me, 1 do.” 



THE EDGE AND THE MIST 



13 




Alpha decided to give it one last 
try. “I’m Leona’s son.” 

Quinn waved a tired hand. “I 
knew Leona two years ago. She 
never had a son, not that she’s 
aware of. I’m sure she would have 
told me.” 

“Does Hawkins know about you 
and Leona?” 

“Never saw any need why he 
should. Or know about you either. 
I assume you were my replace- 
ment. Leona should have told you 
about me.” 

“She must have figured Haw- 
kins wouldn’t want a toxer around 
him.” 

Quinn shrugged lightly. “She 
doesn’t know Hawkins very well. 
Now — tell me — what’s your 
game?” 

“Just what I said. I want to go 
into the Mist. Hawkins is the only 
one still going out there. So I de- 
cided to make his acquaintance.” 
“And Leona helped you.” 

“No. Why should she? I heard 
about Hawkins through her and I 
used what she told me. But I’m not 
a spy or anything. I’m a good 
guy.” 

“But why play this role?” 
“Because I didn’t think Haw- 
kins would trust a stranger.” 

“You were right.” 

“And now?” 

“And now nothing,” Quinn said. 
“You’re here and until you make 
a slip you stay. I’m going to bed.” 
He went. Alpha went over to the 
viewer and watched a movie that 



was three hundred years old. He 
liked it. 

D EAK watched Nyby slide into 
his quarters and grinned at the 
closing door. He shouted, “And 
don’t come out till you’ve got some 
pants on — ’’.and, laughing, went 
away. 

Deak could not respect any man 
who allowed himself to be humil- 
iated by something intangible like 
the loss of a pair of trousers. Not 
that he could ever have held much 
respect for a man like Nyby un- 
der any circumstances. Deak rode 
the corridors outward toward 
the tubes, jumping from line to 
line with the genuine Joyfulness of 
a man half his age. He felt fine. 

Hawkins had told him to come 
out right away. Deak wondered 
about this. Hawkins hadn’t 
seemed at all surprised by Nyby’s 
visit. He might have been expect- 
ing it all along. But Deak knew 
what the consequences of the visit 
would be. 

He asked himself two questions: 
A re you afraid? Do you want to go? 

Afraid he ought to be. He had 
never been out before, had never 
allowed Hawkins to talk him in- 
to the Mist. Hawkins had been in 
it six times and Quinn twice. But 
they were mad. As far as Deak was 
concerned the Mist could stay un- 
conquered. In a few thousand 
years, when the galaxy was filled 
with people, it would be time to 
worry about reaching other parts 



14 



GALAXY 




of the universe. But not now. It 
was too soon. Nobody really 
cared. 

Except Hawkins. And Quinn. 
And maybe the kid. 

But they were crazy. 

Deak wasn’t crazy, but he was 
going out there this time. He 
wasn’t crazy; he was old. 

He was ready to die and when he 
died he wanted his friends near 
him. That’s all there was to it. And 
so — the Mist. 

Deak arrived at the tubes and 
slid off the final corridor. The place 
was nearly empty. The Edge had 
been originally planned as a 
jumping off point for intergalac- 
tic travel but the discovery of the 
Mist had put a stop to that. Now it 
was rarely used at all. Only three 
ships were presently in the tubes 
and one of them was Hawkins’. 

Deak went over to him. Haw- 
kins said, “Everything all right?” 
Deak nodded and told him the 
conclusion of the story. Hawkins 
smiled with appreciation and 
pointed to the docked crusier. 

“Get aboard,” he said. 

“We’re leaving? Now?” 

“I’ve got a few more things to do 
and I want your help. The others 
would only get in the way. When 
we’re ready for them we’ll call.” 
Deak nodded and moved 
obediently toward the ship. Haw- 
kins called after him, “How’s 
Quinn holding up?” 

“Pretty fair. He hasn’t hit the 
worst yet.” 



“I know,” Hawkins said. “It’s 
not going to be easy.” 

“You can dump him.” 

Hawkins shrugged and said, 
“Something’s bothering you, 
too. What?” 

“I’m wondering why you want to 
take me.” 

“Why shouldn’t I?” 

“I’m old,” Deak said. “Past my 
prime. I’ve only got one leg and 
sometimes it seems like my mind 
has to fight its way through a bowl 
of thick soup before I can think a 
straight thought. I’m not going to 
do you much good out there.” 
Hawkins shook his head. “I need 
three men for this and I’ve got 

them. One of them is a toxer. An- 
other is just a kid. You’re old and 
crippled. But the kid’s going to be 
good some day. Quinn was good 
once and he’s going to be good 
again. You were good once, too, 
and maybe you’ve passed the point 
where you can go back. But you’ve 
got your memories, haven’t you? 
You know what it was like back 

then. You’re going to do me a lot 
of good out there. 1 need you.” 

Deak nodded. “That’s all I 
wanted to know.” He moved to- 
ward the ship. 

Ill 



THE MIST 

I T HAD originally been discov- 
ered by sheer accident. One of the 



THE EDGE AND THE MIST 



15 




very first faster-than-light intra- 
space cruisers had run smack into 
it. 

The ship was the Princess. A 
minor error had dropped it outside 
the galaxy. The captain of the 
Princess, a curious and adven- 
turesome man, had decided that 
since he was there (outside the gal- 
axy) he might as well take a look 
around. He had prepared his ship 
for another intraspace jump, 
this time into adjacent darkness. 
He had jumped. And landed right 
back where he’d started. The cap- 
tain had shaken his head and tried 
it once more. With the same re- 
sults. Back again. The captain was 
not a fool. He went home. And 
filed a report. The report had 
been read and studied. An investi- 
gation had been conducted. The 
panel conducting the investiga- 
tion had told the captain that he 
ought to stay where he belonged. 
Inside the galaxy. It was a big 
place. Unexplored. First things 
first. 

The galaxy had remained a big 
place but it was no longer unex- 
plored. There were other galaxies 
out there and perhaps it was time 
for man to take a look at them. 
The Edge was built. And the Mist 
was officially discovered. 

The first ship made four at- 
tempts at four different places, 
each removed from the others by 
several thousand light years. The 
results were the same. The ship 
went into intraspace. And it 



moved. It came out again. It had 
not moved. 

Another ship tried it. And an- 
other. Finally an enterprising cap- 
tain decided to do it the slow way, 
with tiny jumps of only a few light 
years. In the course of this he be- 
came the first man to see the Mist 
with his own eyes. And the first 
man to enter the Mist in normal 
space. Three of his crew died. Two 
more were driven permanently 
mad. The others turned the ship 
around and came home. They 
spoke of a great and twisting mist 
of red and orange flames. They had 
photographic proof and they were 
believed. 

Almost at the same time, at the 
opposite end of the galaxy, an- 
other ship found the Mist and en- 
tered it. All but one crew member 
died. He spoke of a fiery hell that 
circled the whole galaxy. He had 
photographic proof. And he was 
believed. 

The Mist became an established 
fact. It was studied and charted. 
Nobody knew what it was, though 
everyone had his/her own 'pet 
theory. A few facts were known: 
The Mist circled the galaxy; it ap- 
peared red in color; it could con- 
trol a ship in intraspace; it could 
control a human mind at any time. 
A few old-fashioned thinkers pro- 
claimed it a visitation of the devil. 
A few, even more old-fashioned, 
said it was only God. 

Over the years official missions 
attempted to crack the Mist by 



16 



GALAXY 




passing over, around, or through 
it. Nothing succeeded and at last 
the Federation government lost 
interest. The galaxy was big 
enough for man. Too many had 
died trying to leave it. From now 
on the Mist — whatever it was, na- 
tural or unnatural, god or devil — 
could stay right where it was. Man 
still had room enough. 

But there are always a few men 
who don’t like to give up. Hawkins 
was one of these. Quinn had been 
another. Alpha was fast becom- 
ing one. Men like these continued 
to go into the Mist time after 
time, trying to crack it. None of 
them succeeded; the government 
frowned at their efforts, tried to 
stop them. But they kept right on 
doing it. 

Hawkins thought of the Mist as 
a wall. If you butt your head 
against a wall often enough and 
hard enough, one of two things will 
happen: the wall will break or 
your head will break. 

Hawkins had a tough head. 

W WHERE’S a ship out there,” 

^ Alpha said. “At the edge of 
the Mist.” 

Hawkins came to stand behind 
him and peer into the viewscreen. 
The Mist was shown as a long area 
of turbulence. Directly in front 
of it was a tiny stationary dot. A 
ship. 

“We’ll head for it and take a 
look when we jump,” Hawkins 
said. “It’s probably a derelict. A 



lot of ships have gone into her and 
never been heard from again. 
Maybe this is one she decided to 
spit out at last. But whatever it is, 
I think we better eat first. Once we 
plunge into the Mist there won’t 
be time. There won’t be time for 
much more than breathing.” 

They had already made their ini- 
tial jump through intraspace. 
Hawkins had taken Deak and 
Quinn into link with himself, 
leaving Alpha outside to handle 
anything that might come up. The 
kid was his best man but he wanted 
Deak and Quinn — especially 
Quinn — where he could watch 
them. Linked with his own mind 
and that of the ship, neither of 
them could do a thing he would not 
immediately know. 

He was using the system that 
had worked best for him in the 
past. This consisted of a long ini- 
tial jump of forty-five light-years, a 
short pause in normal space for 
eating and relaxing, then a sec- 
ond and final jump of five light- 
years, which put them as close to 
the Mist as one could get without 
falling straight inside. The Mist 
was not wide in cosmic distance. 
Hawkins figured it would take a 
month, maximum, to penetrate it 
all the way even at normal speeds. 
Not that anybody had ever come 
near to lasting that long in it. 
Hawkins held the record at twen- 
ty-nine hours, but the last four 
hours he had spent running for his 
life. 



THE EDGE AND THE MIST 



17 




The ship carried enough food — 
concentrates and fluids primarily 
— to keep the crew fat and healthy 
for a year if necessary. Hawkins 
looked at his people and laughed 
inwardly for the hundredth time 
since the ship had left the Edge. 
These were the three best men he 
could find. Quinn was sitting 
propped against the wall, shaking 
like a tree in the wind. Deak stood 
near the opposite wall, muttering 
the way all old men mutter. And 
Alpha — well. Alpha looked all 
right. He was tall, strong and up- 
right. He was also a liar. He had 
not fooled Hawkins for more than 
a moment. Not that the lie was 
necessarily a handicap. Hawkins 
figured this way: any man who 
wanted into the Mist badly enough 
to lie his way there deserved the 
opportunity. Maybe that meant 
Alpha was insane, but he was hard- 
ly alone. Deak insisted Hawkins 
was crazy and Deak was often right 
about a lot of things. But if he ever 
made it through, if he ever stood 
on the other side looking over his 
shoulder at the fiery inferno that 
lay behind him, the hell that had 
killed a hundred men like they were 
bugs to be squashed — then nobody 
would call Hawkins mad. They 
might think it, but they wouldn’t 
say it. 

The four of them ate hurriedly 
and Hawkins took Quinn and 
Deak into the back to link. While 
linked, a man ceased to be an indi- 
vidual consciousness, became a 



part of the ship, able to combine 
his human instincts with the me- 
chanical computers of the ship. It 
took at least two men in link to 
operate a ship through inter- 
stellar space. Intraspace had to be 
entered and left at exactly the 
proper moment. An error of a mi- 
crosecond could mean that the 
ship was forever lost. 

This jump — only five light-years 
in distance — was a simple one. 
Linked with Deak and Quinn, 
Hawkins took predominance. It 
was his voice that Alpha heard 
over the communications sys- 
tem. It was his mind that made all 
the final decisions. But he used all 
the information fed to him by 
Deak and Quinn. 

At the proper point they entered 
intraspace. At the next proper 
point they left it. The trip, like all 
good trips, was uneventful. Haw- 
kins broke the link and rose to his 
feet. He headed forward and ran 
into Alpha coming in the oppo- 
site direction. 

Alpha said, “We’ve got com- 
pany.” 

Hawkins asked, “That ship we 
saw?” 

“Yes. I called it as soon as we re- 
entered. Somebody is on board. 
The call was faint. But I think it’s a 
woman.” 

“Qh, Lord,” said Hawkins. 

I T WAS a woman. Hawkins 
talked to her. Her ship was crip- 



18 



GALAXY 




pled. She was lost. Hawkins told 
Alpha to go fetch her. 

He brought the woman on 
board. She had been alone on the 
ship except for two dead men who 
lay in the aft compartment. Haw- 
kins sent the ship drifting. Some 
time, some day, somebody might 
find it and bury the men. But prob- 
ably not. 

The woman was about thirty 
years old, with narrow bones and a 
soft, pretty face. She said her 
name was Okla and that the dead 
men were her brothers. Both of 
them had been smart and brave but 
only one had wanted to enter the 
Mist. He’d talked the other into it 
and Okla had come with them'. 
“How long?” Hawkins asked. 
“How long what?” she asked. 
Her voice was as pretty as her face. 
“How long did you last?” 

“About five hours.” 

“And your brave, bold broth- 
ers?” 

“You shouldn’t talk about them 
that way. They’re dead, you 
know.” 

“And you’re not. So?” 

“It killed them almost right 
away. They said they were suffo- 
cating. I think the walls were clos- 
ing in on them. At least that’s what 
I saw. But I knew it was only an 
illusion. Walls don’t crush you in 
the middle of space. I knew that.” 
“If you believe they can, they 
can. That’s how it works.” 

She said, “You think you know 
a lot about it.” 



“I’ve been in there six times.” 
“He holds the record,” Deak 
said. “This is Hawkins. He did 
twenty-nine hours one time and 
barely made it out.” 

“That’s not so much,” she said. 
“I could have done better, but not 
alone. That’s why I jumped. Just 
me. I barely made it out of intra- 
space and blew the drive doing it. 
I’ll make it this time if one of you 
can do it with me.” 

Alpha said, “You mean you 
want to go back.” 

“I’ve got a crew of profession- 
als with me this time. How can I 
miss?” 

Hawkins told her there were a 
lot of ways but she didn’t believe 
him. 



IV 

S O NOW they were five. Haw- 
kins ticked them off on his fin- 
gers: a toxer, broken and haunted; 
an old man, crippled and senile; a 
boy, untruthful and naive; and a 
woman who had watched two 
brothers die and thought them 
weak. That was only four. Haw- 
kins pointed a mental finger at 
himself. 

A madman. A fool . 

Their ship lay in wait at the very 
edge of the Mist. Hawkins had 
closed the manual viewscreens 
but not before taking one quick 
look outside. The Mist hadn’t 
changed; it looked as it had always 



THE EDGE AND THE MIST 



19 




looked. Like a fire. A great fire in 
the void, stretching toward in- 
finity, circling the galaxy. 

Quinn was trying to talk to him. 
Hawkins wasn’t listening but he 
was watching. Quinn looked bad. 
His hands were shaking and his 
eyes were like hollow pits. 

Quinn was saying, “You can’t 
take a woman in there. We haven’t 
got the room. It’s suicide.” 

Hawkins brushed him off. The 
last thing he needed now was 
Quinn. He said, “She just came out 
of there. She knows what she’s do- 
ing. And her hands are steady as a 
rock.” 

Quinn went away. Hawkins 
turned to Alpha and said, “Take 
her in. And get yourself ready. 
Sometimes the Mist hits you first 
thing — sometimes it waits an hour 
or two. But be ready.” 

“What’ll it be like?” Alpha 
said. 

“You’ll find out,” Hawkins told 
him and slapped him lightly on the 
arm. 

Alpha put them forward. 

The Mist swallowed them. 
Sometimes when you first went in 
and you were young enough and 
foolish enough to make the mis- 
take of looking and watching, the 
Mist changed itself into a great 
fish, opened its mouth and literal- 
ly swallowed your craft. This had 
happened to Hawkins the first 
time he’d gone in. That had been 
the last time he had looked. This 
time he read the report on the 



transviewer, which showed the 
cruiser surrounded by the Mist. 
That was enough proof for him. 

The Mist had swallowed them 
and they were alone. Until they re- 
turned (if ever returned) they 
could not contact a soul. Radios 
didn’t work inside the Mist, ei- 
ther coming or going. They were 
alone, the five of them and their 
craft, as thoroughly alone as any 
man can be. 

They were all sitting around the 
main forward cabin now, simply 
waiting. Okla and Alpha were 
chatting quietly in one corner. 
Quinn and Deak were in another. 
Deak was singing and strumming 
a Vaella, a musical instrument 
from one of the outer Karnian 
worlds, the sound of which was a 
cross between a mouth harp and a 
classical guitar. Normally 
Hawkins found it lovely and gen- 
tle — now it grated on him. 

Hawkins tried to ignore the 
noise. Quinn worried him, sitting 
with his head in his hands, shaking 
and trembling. Hawkins went 
over to him. 

“Well?” 

Quinn ignored him. 

“Are you going to make it?” 

Quinn took his head out of his 
hands. The hands continued to 
shake and the head twitched. 

He said, “I’ll make it.” 

Hawkins said, “Why did you 
come along?” 

“You said you wanted me.” 

“I did.” 



20 



GALAXY 




“And do?” 

“I said I did. I thought I needed 
you. I thought you could do it.” 
“And now that you’ve seen me in 
action you’ve changed your mind. 
Is that what you’re trying to say?” 
Hawkins tried to make his tone 
soft and caring. 

“If I’d wanted to say that I 
would have said it.” 

Quinn said, “You’ve killed a lot 
of men, Hawkins.” 

D EAK stopped strumming the 
Vaella. Alpha and Okla were 
no longer chatting. 

Hawkins said, “Go about your 
business. Relax while you can.” 
He turned back to Quinn and tried 
again to soften his voice. “What’s 
wrong with you? Get Deak to give 
you some medicine.” 

Quinn shook his head. “I’m not 
afraid of the Mist,” he said. “I just 
don’t like it.” 

“Nobody likes it,” Hawkins 
said. 

“It’s gloating,” Quinn said. 
“Can’t you feel it? It can see right 
through the ship like it was glass. 
Right now it’s looking right 
square at me. And laughing. 
Gloating.” 

“Get hold of yourself. That’s 
nothing compared to what can 
happen. Don’t you know that?” 
Quinn started to laugh. The 
laugh kept getting higher and 
higher, more and more shrill, un- 
til it broke, cracked, turned into a 
shriek. 



“Shut up,” Hawkins said. 

“Don’t I know? Don’t I know? 
What don’t 1 know, Hawkins? 
Why do you think it’s gloating? 
I’m its finest product. It killed 
me, made me dead. I didn’t breathe 
or think or do anything. It’s killed 
a lot of men before, but I’m the 
first who’s ever come back so that 
it could view the results. That’s 
why it’s laughing. That’s why it’s 
gloating. It sees what a mess I am. 
Laughing at me — proud of its 
handiwork — and gloating.” 

“Deak,” Hawkins said. 

“Yes, sir,” said Deak. He had 
begun to play again but softly. 

“Take Quinn into quarters and 
give him a shot.” 

“The hell,” Quinn said. “What 
are you afraid of, Hawkins? Me? 
Because I’ve got the shakes? 
Damned right I’ve got the shakes. 
My tox was my salvation. It’s the 
only good thing I’ve had since my 
death and you had to go ahead and 
take that away from me. You don’t 
know how to let well enough alone, 
do you? You had to come into my 
private hell and pull me out and 
save my life. My honor. I don’t 
want my honor back. And my 
life — I gave up my life a long time 
ago.” 

Everyone was watching now. 

Softly Hawkins said, “Shut 
up.” 

Quinn smiled and rose to his 
feet. He stood in front of Haw- 
kins, toe to toe, shaking. Careful- 
ly he drew back his arm and 



THE EDGE ANDTHEMIST

opened his fist. His hand struck 
across Hawkins’s face. Hawkins 
dropped to his knees. 

Hawkins wiped at his face and 
looked at his hand. It was clean. 

He looked up at Quinn and said, 
“That’s the second time you’ve hit 
me. Don’t ever try it again.” 

Quinn spun around and looked 
at the wall. He wrapped his arms 
across his chest and gripped his el- 
bows. He was trembling. 

Hawkins climbed to his feet. 
“Deak. Take him away and give 
him something.” 

“Tox?” 

“You’ve got some?” 

“I brought a dose. Just in case.” 
“Then give it to him. If he wants 
it.” 

Deak led Quinn from the cabin. 
Okla asked Hawkins, “Are you 
happy now?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You pushed him into it. He 
was trying to fight it on his own. 
You had to break him.” 

“I was trying to make him.” 

“Do you really believe that?” 
“Quinn wants to die. He was 
dead once and I think he liked it. I 
think he wants to go back where he 
was happiest. Well, out here he’s 
got the chance. I wish him luck.” 
“You’re a self-righteous bas- 
tard,” she told him. 

“Maybe so,” Hawkins said. 
“I’ve never been called one be- 
fore, but maybe I am.” He 
changed the tone of his voice, put- 
ting a taste of authority back in- 



to it. “Alpha, come here. Let’s 
check the boards.” 

There really wasn’t anything to 
check. The instruments showed 
exactly what they ought to have 
showed. They were in the Mist. 
They had entered it approxi- 
mately thirty-three minutes ago. 
The radio was clear but nonfunc- 
tional. The air level was safe and 
normal. Everything was nor- 
mal. Everything was safe. And 
soon they would be dying. 

Deak poked his head into the 
room and waved a hand at Haw- 
kins. 

“What do you want, Deak?” 
“Quinn says he doesn’t want any 
tox.” 

“That’s his business. I’m not 
going to force it on him.” 

“He says he wants to go into 
link.” 

“He can’t go in alone.” 

“He wants me to go with him.” 
“Why?” 

“He says he feels better in link. 
He can’t feel his body — so the 
shakes don’t bother him.” 

“You better let me talk to 
him.” Hawkins turned to the rear. 
“Keep an eye on the boards and 
call me if anything happens,” he 
told Alpha. He gave Okla a smile 
and went with Deak. 

T here were four bunks in the 
back compartment, spaces for a 
maximum of four men to live dur- 
ing link. Quinn was lying on one of 
the bunks. It was not in commis- 



22 



GALAXY 




sion. He looked worse than be- 
fore. He opened his eyes when 
Hawkins came near. 

“Do you think this trip is de- 
signed as personal therapy for 
you? I haven’t got time to concern 
myself with your personal prob- 
lems.” 

Quinn closed his eyes and laid a 
hand across his lids. He said, 
“Let’s not start that over again.” 
He raised his hands and held them 
up tautly. “See, Hawkins? They’re 
steady, aren’t they? Like trees on 
a still day? Isn’t this what you 
wanted? Isn’t this the self-control 
you preach?” 

“So why send Deak crying to 
me?” 

“Because I’ve got an idea and it 
doesn’t have anything to do with 
my problems. Not much anyway. 
Are you willing to hear it?” 

Hawkins nodded and sat on the 
bunk opposite the one Quinn oc- 
cupied. He reached into his tunic 
and drew out two cigarettes. He 
lit them both and passed one to 
Quinn. 

“I’m listening.” 

“You’ve said you thought this 
whole thing came down to a battle 
of wills. If a man was stronger 
than the Mist he’d beat it. Right?” 

“I said that. And maybe it’s 
right. I don’t know. Nobody real- 
ly understands the Mist.” 

“Nobody knows why it’s here.” 

“That’s right.” 

“But it’s pretty much accepted 
that something put it here. And 



for some reason. Maybe not a 
reason that makes sense to us, but 
I think it’s there to keep us penned 
in our own galaxy. And it’s not in- 
vincible. If we thought it was we 
wouldn’t be here. Except to kill 
ourselves. But that’s not your 
way — or Alpha’s or the girl’s.” 

“1 think it can be broken,” 
Hawkins said. 

“If you’re stronger than it.” 

“Get to the point.” 

“That is the point: no one man is 
stronger than the Mist. But a com- 
bination of many of them — and a 
machine — might be. In other 
words, link. No other being in the 
known Universe is as strong as a 
linked space cruiser.” 

“Linked ships have gone in 
before. And gotten thrown out.” 
“Because they were in intra- 
space. We know that now. You 
can’t enter the Mist while in in- 
traspace. It rejects you. But ships 
aren’t usually linked while they’re 
in normal space. I think it ought 
to be tried.” 

“I’ll tell Deak to come back.” 
“And Alpha.” 

“1 need Alpha out front. You 
can have Deak.” Hawkins got to 
his feet and stubbed out his ciga- 
rette. 

“You still think I’m trying to 
avoid the shakes.” 

Hawkins put his hand on the 
door. “You wanted to try it — we’re 
trying it. Call me when you’re 
linked.” 

When he got back to the for- 



THE EDGE AND THE MIST 



23 




ward cabin he gave Deak his or- 
ders. Deak tried to protest and 
Hawkins hurried him along. The 
old man went but he was hurt. He 
said he felt he was being pushed 
out of the way. And maybe he 
was. Hawkins didn’t have time to 
worry about people’s injured 
feelings. Get all the weak ones out 
of the way. Sweep them into a 
dusty corner and tell them to sit. 
Let the strong ones take com- 
mand. Have them run the show. 
That was how battles were won. 

He was worried. 

H e DIDN’T like the way things 
were going. He called Alpha 
and together they ran a check. 
Their time in the Mist was well 
over an hour now and nothing had 
happened. It made him nervous, 
restless. Alpha seemed the same 
way. The girl appeared frightened. 
The ship beeped him. 

Hawkins said, “What?” 

The voice was Quinn’s. Some- 
what colder, lacking in emotion, 
but Quinn’s. That meant he had es- 
tablished predominance, which 
was only to be expected. 

The voice asked, “You want a 
reading on the outside condi- 
tions?” 

“Give it to me.” 

“On our left is a fleet of ships, 
about fifty of them. They’re firing 
atomic warheads at us. Just small 
stuff. A spider about twenty-five 
feet in diameter is squatting on 
the hull. It doesn’t appear to be 



doing any damage. Below it are 
two snakes wrapped around the 
ship. One of them is chewing his 
way inside.” 

“Are these local phenomena — 
or general?” 

“General, we think. Deak’s com- 
ponent can see it. And Quinn’s. 
The ship can’t, of course.” 

“How does the situation feel to 
the Quinn component?” Haw- 
kins was being deliberately am- 
biguous. 

For a change I’ll try tact . 

“Quinn reports: ‘The situation 
is horrible but 1 feel fine.’ ” 

“Talk later,” Hawkins said. 

He turned away from the con- 
trol panel and tapped his fingers 
against the back of his chair. Al- 
pha seemed all right. The girl 
looked better. If anything, she 
was too calm. She worried him. 

The board at his back beeped 
again and he turned on the audi- 
ble. 

The link voice said, “The snake 
just broke through. It’s in the link 
chamber. It’s still hungry, so 
watch for it. We think for certain 
now that it’s general. We’d place 
its length at forty feet. It’s green 
with light pink spots.” 

Hawkins told the others about 
the snake. Its presence irritated 
him. He had long ago come to the 
conclusion that the Mist was dis- 
tinctly aware of him as an in- 
dividual. He had flown into it six 
times before this. He held the rec- 
ord for longest duration. And 



24 



GALAXY 




now here it was. Nothing but 
snakes and spiders. On previous 
trips such creatures had swal- 
lowed him whole. It would take 
more than this to reach him. 

The girl started screaming. 
Hawkins bounded out of his 
chair almost with relief and ran to- 
ward her. He shouted at Alpha, 
“Hold her — ” and kept coming. 
Alpha made a grab for her but she 
knocked him out of the way. She 
was using her hands as claws. 
Alpha slid out of her way and she 
danced to her feet, screaming. 

“Can’t do it — can’t breathe — 
not again — so close — ’’ She lashed 
out with both feet as though try- 
ing to kick something. She fell 
over and Hawkins landed on her 
chest. 

“Hold her arms,’’ he told Alpha. 
Hawkins started shouting at her. 
He had a good idea now what had 
happened on her first trip into the 
Mist. The Mist had reached her as 
it had reached her brothers. She 
had lived but she had been humili- 
ated. She had wanted another op- 
portunity. It hadn’t worked. 

“I’m going to try to talk her out 
of it,” Hawkins said. “Keep a tight 
grip on her and listen to me. It 
might grab you at any time.” 
“What?” Alpha gasped, trying 
his best to hold the screaming girl. 
“What does she see?” 

“The ship closing in on her, I 
think. If it happens to you laugh at 
it. Now listen — ” 

Hawkins’ voice was calm and 



soft. He said, “Okla. Okla, listen 
to me. You are perfectly fine. 
You are a passenger on a space 
cruiser. Federation license num- 
ber nine-five-six-seven-five. I am 
the captain of this ship. My name 
is Hawkins. There is nothing 
wrong with you. The ship is fully 
under the control of its crew. I am 
breathing the air now. It is fine. 
Rich. Clean. 1 feel fine. You feel 
fine.” 

Alpha caught on and said, 
“Okla, this is Alpha. There’s noth- 
ing wrong with you. It’s only the 
Mist. You’ve been through it be- 
fore. It’s the same as then. Just an 
illusion. Nothing can hurt you. 
We’re almost through.” 

The last was a lie but a harmless 
one. Hawkins knew that if they 
failed to snap the illusion the girl 
would die. That simple. If she 
thought she was suffocating — and 
continued to think so for a suffi- 
cient period of time — she would 
suffocate. 

Quinn’s voice came on, dead- 
ened by the link. “Position of ship, 
normal. Condition of ship, excel- 
lent. Condition of crew — 
healthy — ” 

Hawkins dropped to his knees 
and held Okla by the neck. He put 
his mouth to her lips and began 
forcing air into her lungs. 

Between breaths he told Alpha, 
“Get something to jab her with.” 

Alpha went away. Hawkins con- 
tinued. Her color was returning, a 
good sign. He pulled away momen- 



THE EDGE ANDTHE MIST 



25 




tarily and watched her chest. It 
was moving. 

She said, “Away—” in a whis- 
per. 

Alpha said, “A giant snake just 
ate its way into the cabin,” and 
handed Hawkins a needle. He 
took it, jabbed it into Okla’s arm 
at the elbow. Her eyes opened and 
she jumped up. Hawkins hit her in 
the mouth. She fell again and be- 
gan spitting blood. 

Hawkins said, “Good,” and 
smiled. He told Alpha, “Take her 
into the back and have her linked. 
We two can handle it out here.” 

Alpha carried the girl away. She 
was moaning and spitting. 

V 

B y the time he reached the 
control panel Hawkins was 
laughing aloud. It was the first 
time he had laughed in the Mist. 

He called the ship and it said, 
“We’re getting full back here.” 
“And outside?” 

“We just passed a cruiser. A real 
one this time, according to the ship. 
A derelict, we suppose. It wasn’t 
moving.” 

“That’s a good sign.” 

“What’s a good sign?” 

“We’re getting deeper.” He 
switched off and turned to face 
Alpha. It was just him and the kid 
now. Was he doing right? Was 
Alpha really the best of the lot? He 
had to be. He was the only one who 
hadn’t cracked yet. The others had 



all failed him when he needed 
them the most. 

Alpha said, “That wasn’t too 
bad. I saw it, too, but I shook it 
off.” 

“It was my mistake,” Hawkins 
said. “I should never have believed 
her. I should’ve believed my eyes. 
She didn’t look as tough as she 
talked.” 

“What’s the time now?” 

“Three hours, ten minutes,” said 
Hawkins. 

“That’s good.” 

“Better than anybody’s ever 
done — except me. It’s good.” 

“What got you out?” 

“I went mad.” 

Alpha laughed. “You went twen- 
ty-nine hours. And it only takes 
twenty-nine days more than that.” 

“Nobody made you come.” 

“That’s true — that’s true.” He 
was still laughing, so Hawkins 
joined him. It didn’t help. 

Four hours had passed. (Haw- 
kins read the clock and nodded. 
Not bad — but getting worse.) 

Five hours. Six. 

Ten hours? (Yes, that’s what it 
said and they were eating dinner 
and Alpha was telling a joke. Ten 
hours and telling a joke?) 

Twelve hours. 

Fifteen hours. (Alpha was sleep- 
ing.) 

Seventeen hours. Seventeen and 
one-half hours. 

E ighteen hours had passed 
since they had first penetrated 



26 



GALAXY 




the Mist and to Hawkins they were 
no longer inside a ship. The ship 
had vanished about two hours 
back, swallowed whole by a crea- 
ture that resembled a mechanical 
elephant. He and Alpha were 
alone now, floating mistily 
through the void. The void? If it 
only were a void. It was a vast pot 
of boiling oil through which they 
floated. A river of molten lava. 
A sleek plain covered with blades 
of fiery grass. And behind them 
was the creature with the five 
heads, the hundred-and-one eyes, 
the gaping mouths and the snakes 
that rose from each of its heads, 
reaching and grasping. 

And the noise. It was impossible 
to talk now; the noise was too thun- 
derous. Was Alpha seeing it all 
too? Hearing it as well? Hawkins 
could not tell, but Alpha was claw- 
ing at his eyes. A bad sign. 

Hawkins reached over and re- 
moved Alpha’s hands from his 
eyes. He put his lips close to his ear 
and shouted, “Don’t be afraid — the 
Mist — all is false.’’ Alpha did not 
reply but stopped clawing at his 
eyes. 

One corner of Hawkins’s mind 
kept insisting: You’re still in the 
ship; you cannot see it, touch it, 
feel it — but it is there . 

Hawkins decided to put this to a 
test. Slowly and carefully he pulled 
himself across (the floor). He went 
to where the control panel ought 
to be, located and lifted (the 
phone). He spoke into it, trying 



not to shout, unable to hear the 
sound of his own voice. 

“Quinn — Quinn — Quinn.’’ 
“Hawkins — where were you?” 
“Right here, Quinn. Here all the 
time. It’s bad, worse than ever. 
You always forget how bad.” 

“It’s bad here, too — but togeth- 
er — ” 

“Alpha is here.” 

“Yes, but we’re the ones mak- 
ing it. That’s the point. This is the 
way. The three of us, leaning on 
one another. Quinn and Deak and 
Okla. And the ship, too. We use 
the ship’s eyes. No illusions, fly- 
ing straight like an arrow.” 

Hawkins spoke slowly: “Auto- 
matic flights can’t make it.” 

“But we’re only partly automat- 
ic. And mostly human.” 

Hawkins was screaming sudden- 
ly and he dropped (the phone). The 
linked voice said, “Hawkins? For 
God’s sake — ” 

Hawkins crawled through the 
Mist and grabbed Alpha by the 
throat. Something was hurting 
him — tiny little things like an 
army of ants. They were eating, 
chewing their way toward the 
light. Alpha had caused it. Haw- 
kins squeezed harder, squeezed 
Alpha’s throat. 

Alpha clawed at Hawkins’ eyes 
and the two of them rolled across 
(the floor). 

And fell through it. 

Down. Straight down, turning, 
twisting, whirling in the airless 
void.' 



THE EDGE ANDTHEMIST 



27 




Alpha was screaming, “The 
Mist — the Mist.” 

Hawkins wouldn’t let go. Alpha 
was younger, stronger, tougher. 
But Hawkins had Right on his 
side. And those things like ants. 
They were still inside him, still 
chewing, and together they fell. 

They went through clouds of 
smoke and flame and fell against 
monsters and creatures, snakes 
and spiders, and combinations of 
both, and more and more and 
worse and worse, rolling, tum- 
bling and falling together. 

They struck. 

Hawkins released his grip, 
jumped to his feet, and ran. He was 
on a wooden platform. He paused 
at the edge and looked back at Al- 
pha. Below was fire and above was 
fire and inside were the things. 
Chewing. 

He turned to jump. 

And something big hit him in the 
back. 

He closed his eyes and began to 
die. 



H awkins awoke and the dis- 
covery that he wasn’t dead came 
as a surprise to him. 

A voice said, “Welcome back, 
Mr. Hawkins.” It seemed to come 
from somewhere inside him. 

Hawkins opened his eyes but saw 
nothing. 

The voice said, “You don’t have 
visual.” 

Hawkins tried to speak. 



“Deak,” he wanted to say, but 
couldn’t. 

Deak said, “I’m predominant. 
Don’t talk; just think.” 

“We’re linked?” 

“Hello, Hawkins,” said Okla’s 
voice. “I guess we weren’t as strong 
as we thought.” 

He was beginning to remember 
now. He asked, “Alpha?” 

“Up front,” Deak said. 

“I thought I’d killed him.” 

“He thought the same about 
you.” 

“How many hours did we make 
it?” 

“Forty-two.” 

“I must’ve been out a long time. 
The last I remember was eighteen.” 
“We kept you out on purpose. 
Wanted to make sure you got all 
the way back.” 

“Where’s Quinn?” 

“In front, acting as captain.” 
“Give me predominance. I want 
to talk to him.” 

Deak said, “Yes, sir.” 

There was a mental shift and 
Hawkins took over. He was feel- 
ing better now, back in a spot to 
which he was long accustomed. 
He beeped the forward cabin and 
got Quinn. 

“Hawkins is predominant and 
awake,” he said, using the linked 
voice. 

“We broke your record.” 
“Hawkins is still captain-of-rec- 
ord. He gets all the credit. How’s 
Alpha?” 

“He’s fine. I had him in link for 



28 



GALAXY 




a while and he pulled out of it.” 
“And you? Hawkins thought you 
were finished.” 

“Somebody had to take over out 
here and I thought I was the best 
candidate. I’ve found out one 
thing — after you’ve died once the 
second time is not so bad. Or the 
third.” 

“Where are we now? How far 
from the Edge?” 

“We’re in the Mist.” 

“What? Hawkins is coming out 
there.” 

“Tell him to stay where he is. 
He’s needed. We’re about to 
jump.” 

“For home?” 

“For the other side. We can’t 
last a month in normal space and 
it’s quiet out there. Take a look. 
Nothing but the Mist, no mon- 
sters, space fleets or atomic bombs. 
I think we can make it.” 

The linked, voice said, “Good 
luck — ” and switched off. 

T hey made the jump an hour 
later. Hawkins let Deak regain 
predominance. He was tired. He 
watched but took no active role. 
They entered intraspace, pro- 
ceeded through it and came out on 
the other side. 

He left the link, got to his feet 
and went forward. Quinn and Al- 
pha were waiting. Quinn looked 
like hell. His whole body was shak- 
ing, his eyes were red as dwarf 
suns, his tongue was fat and swol- 
len. 



“We made it,” he said. 

Hawkins allowed himself a 
smile. Deak and Okla had entered 
the cabin and the five of them 
crowded around the control pan- 
el. They looked at the viewscreen, 
expanded to show an area fifteen 
light-years in diameter. First they 
looked at the dot which represent- 
ed their ship, then they looked to- 
ward the Edge. Between the Edge 
and the ship lay the Mist. 

“Now what?’’ Deak asked. 
“You do something like this and 
there’s nothing left except to go 
back and do it again the other 
way.” 

“Now we wait for them to come 
for us,” said Hawkins. 

“Who’s them?” Okla asked. 

“Whoever put that thing up. 
They’ll be here. We wait.” 

Quinn looked sour. He turned to 
Deak. “If there’s more waiting to 
be done I’m going to need help be- 
fore I fall over.” 

“Medicine’s in the back,” Deak 
said, and the two of them went 
away. 

T he alien craft appeared on the 
viewscreen one hour later. It 
was enormous, at least twice the 
size of any human ship. A tenta- 
tive radio contact was exchanged 
— the multiplication tables. 

The next message arrived simul- 
taneously in the minds of all five 
humans. You have succeeded in 
passing the first of your tests. Our 
race extends to your race its con- 



THE EDGE AND THE MIST 



29 




gratulations on your first step to- 
ward true maturity as a people. 
Your second test has been devised 
and now awaits your efforts. 

The alien ship was gone from the 
screen. 

The Mist was no longer behind 
them. It, too, was gone. But some- 
thing new had appeared on the 
screen, larger than the Mist and 
more solid in appearance, like a 
great wall that stretched outward 
toward infinity. The Wall lay di- 
rectly in front of their craft. 

Hawkins said, “The bastards,” 
and ordered his crew to prepare for 
the journey home. 



THE EDGE 



D EAK sat alone in the plushly 
lined office and played with the 
dials of an intraspace phone. He 
enjoyed being alone with his mem- 
ories of the days when he’d been 
out there, hunting and seeking for 
whatever it was that man always 
sought. 

The time he, Hawkins and the 
rest had come back from the Mist 
was easy for him to remember. It 
had been exactly one year ago. 
Nyby had arrested the lot of 
them, too stupid to understand 
that they had done what no other 
man had ever done, that they were 
heroes. 

They had never gone to jail, of 
course. They had been heroes for a 
while and then everybody forgot 



and they were just people again. 
But the memories were still there, 
clear and warm and fine. 

But things were okay now, too, 
Deak decided. He liked this soft 
life, enjoyed his plush office and 
simple job. 

He took the phone and dialed a 
number. There was a pause, then 
he said, “This is the Governor. 
What I want is — ” 

A lpha touched the girl’s hand 
and said, “This place never 
changes. It’s been a year and it’s 
the same.” 

“Some things never change.” 
Quinn stood at the bar, drinking 
with a group of green-skinned 
aliens. Alpha and Okla went over 
to join him. 

Okla said, “I’m happy now, hap- 
pier than I’ve ever been. Isn’t that 
all that matters? I know it wasn’t 
my doing, that I should never even 
have been there, but I was there 
and it made me feel good.” 

Alpha said, “It did that for all of 
us — and all of us should never have 
been there.” 

“Except Hawkins,” said Quinn. 



BEYOND THE EDGE 
AND THE MIST 



Hawkins was outside, beyond 
the Edge and beyond the Mist. He 
was searching, seeking, hunting. 
He was hunting for life. 

Hawkins faced the Wall. ★

I 

I WORK for a stockbroker on the 
twenty-first floor. Things have 
not been good for stockbrokers re- 
cently, what with tight money and 
hysterical reaction to the news 
and all that. When business gets 
really bad for a brokerage it often 
doesn’t fail — it merges. This has 
something to do with the public 
image. The company I work for is 
going through the agony. For the 
lower echelons — me — that means 
detail you wouldn’t believe, with 
a reduced staff. In other words, 
night work. Last night I worked 
without looking up urttil my 
whole body was the shape of the 
chair and there was a blue haze 
around the edges of everything I 
could see. I finished a stack and 
peered at the row of stacks still to 
be done and tried to get up. It took 
three tries before my hips and 
knees would straighten enough to 



let me totter into the hall and 
down to the men’s room. It never 
occurred to me to close the office 
door and I guess the confusion, all 
the strange faces coming and go- 
ing for the past few days, extend- 
ed to the security man downstairs. 
However it happened, there was a 
dazed man in my office when I 
came back a moment later. 

He was well dressed — I guess 
that, too, helped him pass the 
guards — in a brown sharkskin suit 
with funny lapels, what you might 
call up-to-the-minute camp. He 
wore an orange knitted tie the like 
of which you only see in a new bou- 
tique or an old movie. I’d say he 
was in his twenties — not yet 
twenty-five. And dazed. 

When I walked in and stopped 
dead he gave me a lost look and 
said, “This is my office.’’ 

I said the only thing I could 
think of. “Oh?” 

He pivoted slowly all the way 



31 




around, looking at the desk, the 
shelves,- the files. 

When he came around to face 
me again he said, “This isn’t my of- 
fice.” 

He had to be with the big five- 
name brokerage house that was 
gobbling up my company in its 
time of need. I asked him. 

“No,” he said, “I work for 
Fortune." 

“Look,” I said, “you’re not only 
in the wrong office, you’re in the 
wrong building. Time-Life is on 
Sixth Avenue — been there since 
nineteen fifty-two.” 

“Fifty-rwo — ” He looked 
around the room again. “But 
1 — but it’s — ” 

He sat down on the settle. I had 
the idea he’d have collapsed on the 
floor if the settle hadn’t been there. 
He asked me what day it was. I 
think I misunderstood. 

“Thursday,” I said. I looked at 
my watch. “Well, it’s now Friday.” 

“I mean, what’s the date?” 

I pointed to the desk calendar 
right beside him. He looked at it 
twice, each one a long careful 
look. I never saw a man turn the 
color he turned. He covered his 
eyes. Even his lips went white. 

“Oh my God.” 

“You all right?” I asked — a very 
stupid question. 

“Tell me something,” he said 
after a while. “Has there been a 
war?” 

“You have to be kidding.” 

He took his hand down and 



looked at me, so lost, so frighten- 
ed. Not frightened. There has to 
be a word. Artguished. He needed 
answers — needed them. Not ques- 
tions, not now. 

I said, “It’s been going on a long 
time.” 

“A lot of young guys killed?” 
“Upwards of fifty thousand.” 
Something made me add: “Ameri- 
cans. The other side, five, six times 
that.” 

“Oh, my God,” he said again; 
Then: “It’s my fault.” 

Now I have to tell you up front 
that it never occured to me for one 
second that this guy was on any 
kind of a drug trip. Not that I’m 
an expert, but there are times 
when you just know. Whatever 
was bothering him was genuine — at 
least genuine to him. Besides, there 
was something about him I had to 
like. Not the clothes, not the face, 
just the guy, the kind of guy he was. 

SAID, “Hey, you look like hell 
and I’m sick and tired of what 
I’m doing. Let’s take a break and 
go to the Automat for coffee.” 

He gave me that lost look again. 
“Is the lid off on sex? 1 mean, 
young kids — ” 

“Like rabbits,” I said. “Also 
your friendly neighborhood movie 
— I don’t know what they’re going 
to do for an encore.” I had to ask 
him, “Where’ve you been?” 

He shook his head and said can- 
didly, “I don’t know where it was. 
Are people leaving their jobs — and

school — going off to live on the 
land?” 

“Some,” I said. “Come on.” 

1 switched off the overhead 
light, leaving my desk lamp lit. He 
got to his feet as if he were wired to 
the switch, but then just stood 
looking at the calendar. 

“Are there bombings?” 

“Three yesterday, in Newark. 
Come on.” 

“Oh, my God,” he said and 
came. I locked the door and we 
went down the corridor to the 
elevators. Air wheezed in the shaft 
as the elevator rose. “It always 
whistles like that late at night,” he 
said. I had never noticed that but 
knew he was right as soon as he 
said it. He also said weakly, “You 
don’t feel like walking down?” 
“Twenty-one flights?” 

The doors slid open. The guy 
didn’t want to get in. But I mean, 
he really didn’t. I stood on the 
crack while he screwed up his cour- 
age. It didn’t take long but I could 
see it was a mighty battle. He won 
it and came in, turned around and 
leaned against the back wall. I push- 
ed the button and we started 
down. He looked pretty bad. I said 
something to him but he put up a 
hand, waved my words away be- 
fore they were out. He didn’t move 
again until the doors opened and 
then he looked into the lobby as if 
he didn’t know what to expect. But 
it was just the lobby, with the oval 
information desk we called the 
fishbowl and the shiny floor and 



the portable wooden desk, like a 
lectern, where you signed in and 
out after hours and where the 
guard was supposed to be. We 
breezed by it and out into Rock- 
efeller Center. He took a deep 
breath and immediately coughed. 

“What’s that smell?” 

I’d been about to say something 
trivial about the one good thing 
about working late — you could 
breathe the air, but I didn’t say it. 

“The smog, I guess.” 

“Smog. Oh yes, smoke and fog. 
I remember.” Then he seemed to 
remember something else, some- 
thing that brought his predica- 
ment, whatever it was, back with a 
hammer blow. “Well of course,” 
he said as if to himself. “Has to 
be.” 

On Sixth Avenue (New Yorkers 
still won’t call it Avenue of the 
Americas) we passed two laughing 
couples. One of the girls was wear- 
ing a see-through top made of 
plastic chainmail. The other had 
on a very maxi coat swinging open 
over a hotpants. My companion 
was appreciative but not astonish- 
ed. I think what he said was, “That, 
too — ” nodding his head. He 
watched every automobile that 
passed and his eyes flicked over 
the places where they used to sell 
books and back-date periodicals, 
every single one of them now given 
over to peepshows and beaver 
magazines. He had the same nod 
of his head for this. 

We reached the Automat and it 



DAZED 



33 




occurred to me that an unchar- 
acteristic touch of genius had 
made me suggest it. I had first 
seen the Automat when I had 
ridden in on my mother’s hip more 
years ago than I’ll mention — and 
many times since — and very little 
has changed — except, of course, 
the numbers on the little off-white 
cards that tell you how many 
nickels you have to put in the slot 
to claim your food. After a few 
years’ absence one tends to yelp at 
the sight of them. I always do and 
the strange young man with me 
did, too. Aside from that, there is a 
timeless quality about the place, 
especially in the small hours of 
the morning. The overage, over- 
painted woman furtively eating 
catsup is there as she, or someone 
just like her, has been for fifty 
years; and the young couple, home- 
ly to you but beautiful to each 
other, full of sleepiness and dis- 
covery; and the working stiff in 
the case-hardened slideway of his 
life, grabbing a bite on the way 
from bed to work and not yet 
awake — no need to be — and his 
counterpart headed in the other 
direction; no need for him to be 
awake either. And all around: the 
same marble change counter with 
the deep worn pits in it from count- 
less millions of coins dropped and 
scooped; behind it the same weary 
automaton; and around you the 
same nickel (not chrome) framing 
for the hundreds of little glass- 
fronted doors through which the 



food always looks so much better 
than it is. All in all, it’s a fine place 
for the reorientation of time- 
travelers. 

“Are you a time-traveler?’’ 1 
asked, following my own whimsy 
and hoping to make him smile. 

He didn’t smile. “No,” he said. 
“Yes, I — well — ” flickering panic 
showed in his eyes — “I don’t real- 
ly know.” 

We bought our coffee straight 
out of the lion’s mouth and car- 
ried it to a corner table. I think 
that when we were settled there he 
really looked at me for the first 
time. 

He said, “You’ve been very 
kind.” 

“Well,” I said, “1 was glad of 
the break.” 

“Look, I’m going to tell you 
what happened. I guess 1 don’t 
expect you to believe me. I 
wouldn’t in your place.” 

“Try me,” I offered. “And any- 
way — what difference does it 
make whether I believe you?” 

“ ‘Belief or nonbelief has no 
power over objective truth.’” I 
could tell by his voice he was quot- 
ing somebody. The smile 1 had 
been looking for almost came and 
he said, “You’re right. I’ll tell you 
what happened because — well, 
because I want to. Have to.” 

I said fine and told him to shoot. 
He shot.

should say I worked — I guess I 
should. You’ll have to pardon me, 
I’m a little confused. There’s so 
much — 

Maybe 1 should start over. It 
didn’t begin in Rockefeller Cen- 
ter. It started, oh, I don’t know 
how long ago, with me wondering 
about things. Not that I’m any- 
thing special — I’m not saying I 
am — but it seems nobody else 
wonders about the same things I 
do. I mean, people are so close to 
what happens that they don’t seem 
to know what’s going on. 

Wait, I don’t want to confuse 
you, too. One of us is enough. Let 
me give you an example. 

World War II was starting up 
when I was a kid and one day a 
bunch of us sat around, trying to 
figure out who would be fighting 
who. Us and the British and 
French on one side, sure — the Ger- 
mans and Austrians and Italians 
on the other — that was clear 
enough. And the Japanese. But be- 
yond that? 

It’s all history and hindsight now 
and there’s no special reason to 
think about it, but at the time it 
was totally impossible for any- 
one to predict the lineup that 
actually came about. Go back in 
the files of newspaper editor- 
ials — Harper's or Reader's Digest 
or any other — and you’ll see what I 
mean. Nobody predicted that up 
to the very end of the war our best 
and strongest friend would be at 
peace with our worst and deadliest 



enemy. I mean, if you put it on per- 
sonal terms — if you and I are 
friends and there’s somebody out 
to kill me and I find out that you 
and he are buddies — could we 
even so much as speak to each 
other again? Yet here was the 
Soviet Union, fighting shoulder to 
shoulder with us against the 
Nazis, while for nearly five years 
they were at peace with Japan! 

And about Japan: there were 
hundreds of thousands of Chinese 
who had been fighting a life-and- 
death war against the Japanese for 
ten years — ten years, man! — and 
along with them, Koreans. So we 
spent billions getting ourselves 
together to mount air strikes 
against Japan from thousands of 
miles away — New Guinea, the 
Solomons, Saipan, Tinian. Do 
you know how far it is from the 
Chinese mainland to Tokyo, 
across the Sea of Japan? Six hun- 
dred miles. Do you know how far it 
is from Pusan, Korea to Hiro- 
shima? A hundred and thirty! 

I’m sorry. I get excited like that 
to this day when I think of it. But 
damn it — why didn’t we negotiate 
to move in and set up airstrips on 
the mainland and Korea? Do you 
think the natives would have turn- 
ed us down? Or is it that we just 
don’t like chop suey? Oh, sure — 
there are a lot of arguments like 
backing up Chiang against the 
Communists and I even read some- 
where that it was not our policy to 
interfere in Southeast Asia. (Did I 



DAZED 



35 




say something funny?) But you 
know Chiang and the Communists 
had a truce — and kept it too — to 
fight the common enemy. 

Well — all right. All that seems a 
long way from what happened to 
me, I suppose, but it’s the kind of 
thing I’ve spent my life wonder- 
ing about. It’s not just wars that 
bring out the thing I’m talking 
about, though God knows they 
make it plainer to see. Italy and 
Germany sharpening their new- 
est weapons and strategies in the 
Spanish civil war, for example, or 
Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia — 
hell, the more sophisticated people 
got the less they could see what was 
in front of them. Any kid in a kin- 
dergarten knows a bully when he 
sees one and has sense enough at 
least to be afraid. Any sixth-grader 
knows how to organize a pressure 
group against a bad guy. Wars, you 
see, are really life-and-death situa- 
tions, where what’s possible, prac- 
tical — logical — has a right to 
emerge. When it doesn’t — you 
have to wonder. French peasants 
taxed till they bled to build the 
Maginot Line all through the 
thirties, carefully preparing 
against the kind of war they fought 
in nineteen fourteen. 

But let’s look some place else. 
Gonorrhea could be absolutely 
stamped out in six months, 
syphilis maybe in a year. I picked 
up a pamphlet last month — hey, I 
have to watch that “last month,’’ 
“nowadays,” things like that — any- 



way, the pamphlet drew a correla- 
tion between smoking cigarettes 
and a rising curve of lung cancer, 
said scientific tests prove that some- 
thing in cigarettes can cause cancer 
in mice. Now I bet if the govern- 
ment came out with an official 
statement about that, people would 
read it and get scared — and go on 
smoking cigarettes. You’re smil- 
ing again. That’s funny? 

WIT ISN’T funny,” I told the 
* dazed man. “Here — let me 
bring some more coffee.” 

“On me this time,” He spilled 
coins on the table. “But you were 
smiling, all the same.” 

“It wasn’t that kind of a smile, 
like for a funny,” I told him. “The 
Surgeon General came out with 
a report years ago. Cigarette ad- 
vertising is finally banned from 
TV, but how much difference does 
it make? Look around you.” 

While he was looking around 
him I was looking at his coins. 
Silver quarters. Silver dimes. 
Nickels: 1948, 1950, 1945. I began 
to feel very strange about this dude. 
Correction: my feel-strange went 
up another notch. 

He said, “A lot of the people 
who aren’t smoking are coughing, 
too.” 

We sat there together, looking 
around. Again he had shown me 
something I had always seen, nev- 
er known. How many people 
cough. 

I went for more coffee.

II 

E WENT on: 

Every four weeks I get — got? — 
got a makeready. A makeready is a 
copy of a magazine with all the 
proofing done and the type set, 
your last look before the presses 
roll. I have to admit it gives 
me- — used to give me — a sense of 
importance to get it free (it’s an 
expensive magazine) even be- 
fore the “men high in government, 
industry, commerce and the pro- 
fessions” (as it says in the circula- 
tion promotion letters I write) 
had a chance to read it and move 
and shake, for they are the movers 
and shakers. 

Anyway, there’s this article in 
the new — not current; really 
new — issue called The Silent 
Generation. It’s all about this 
year’s graduating class, the young 
men who in June would go into the 
world and begin to fit their hands 
to the reins. This is nineteen-fifty 
I’m talking about, you under- 
stand, in the spring. And it was 
frightening. I mean, it spooked me 
while I read it and it spooked me 
more and more as I thought about 
it — the stupidity of it, the unbe- 
lievable blindness of people — not 
necessarily people as a whole, but 
these people in the article — The 
Class of 1950 — young and bright 
and informed. They had their 
formal education behind them 
and you assumed it was fresh in 
their minds — not only what they 



had learned, but the other thing 
college is really for: learning how 
to learn. 

And yet what do you suppose 
they were concerned about? What 
was it they talked about until three 
o’clock in the morning? What kind 
of plans were they making for 
themselves — and for all the rest of 
us (for they were going to be the 
ones who run things)? Democ- 
racy? Ultimate purpose? The re- 
lationship of man to his planet — or 
of modern man to history? Hell, 
no. 

According to this article, they 
worried about fringe benefits. Re- 
tirement income, for God’s sake! 
Speed of promotion in special- 
ized versus diversified industry! 
Did they spend their last few col- 
legiate weeks in sharpening their 
new tools or in beering it up — or 
even in one last panty raid? Uh- 
uh. They spent them moving from 
office to office of the campus re- 
cruiters for big electronic and 
chemical and finance companies, 
working out the deal that would 
get them the steadiest, surest in- 
come and the biggest scam on the 
side and the softest place to lie 
down at the end of it. 

The Silent Generation, the guy 
who wrote the article called them. 
He himself graduated in the late 
’thirties and he had a lot to say 
about his generation. There was a 
lot wrong about them and they did 
some pretty crazy things. They ar- 
gued a lot with each other and with 




DAZED 



37 




their elders and betters and they 
joined things like the Young So- 
cialist League — not so much be- 
cause they were really lefties, but 
because those groups seemed the 
only ones around that gave a damn 
about the state the world was in. 
Most of all, you knew they were 
there. They were a noisy genera- 
tion. They had that mixture of 
curiosity and rebellion that let 
you know they were alive. 

The writer looked at the Class of 
’50 with a kind of despair — and 
something like terror, too. Be- 
cause if they came to run things, 
experience wouldn’t merely modify 
them and steady them. It would 
harden them like an old man’s ar- 
teries. It would mean more-of-the- 
same until they’d be living in a com- 
pletely unreal world of their own 
with no real way of communicating 
with the rest of us. Growing and 
changing and trying new ways 
would only frighten them. They’d 
have the power, and what they’d 
use it for would be to suppress 
growth and change, not knowing 
that societies need growth and 
change to live. Just like trees or ba- 
bies or art or science. So all he 
could see ahead was a solid, silent, 
prosperous standstill — and then 
some sudden and total collapse, 
like a tree gone to dry rot. 

Well I don’t know what you 
think of all this — or if you under- 
stand how hard it hit me. But I’ve 
tried to explain to you how all my 
life I’ve been plagued by 



these — well, I call them wonder- 
ments — how, when something 
makes no sense, it kind of hurts. 
When 1 was a toddler I couldn’t 
sleep for wanting someone to tell 
me why a wet towel is darker than 
a dry one when water has no color. 
In grade school nobody could tell 
me why the sound of a falling 
bomb gets lower and lower in pitch 
as it approaches the ground, when 
by all the laws of physics it ought to 
rise. And in high school I wouldn’t 
buy the idea about a limitation on 
the velocity of light. (And I still 
don’t.) About things like these I’ve 
never lost faith that somebody, 
some day, would come up with an 
answer that would satisfy me — and 
sure enough, from time to time 
somebody does. But when 1 was 
old enough to wonder why smart 
people do dumb things that kind of 
faith could only last so long. And I 
began to feel that there was some 
other factor, or force, at work. 

Do you remember Gulliver’s 
Travels? When he was in Lilliput 
there was a war between the Lilli- 
putians and another nation of lit- 
tle people — I forget what they 
called themselves — and Gulliver 
intervened and ended the war. 
Anyway, he researched the two 
countries and found they had once 
been one. And he tried to find out 
what caused so many years of 
bitter enmity between them after 
they split. He found that there had 
been two factions in that original 
kingdom — the Big Endians and 



38 



GALAXY 




the Little Endians. And do you 
know where that started? Far back 
in their history, at breakfast one 
morning, one of the king’s cour- 
tiers opened his boiled egg at the 
big end and another told him that 
was wrong, it should be opened at 
the small end! The point Dean 
Swift was making is that from 
such insignificant causes grow 
conflicts that can last centuries 
and kill thousands. Well, he was 
near the thing that’s plagued me all 
my life, but he was content to say 
it happened that way. What blow- 
torches me is — why. Why are 
human beings capable of hating 
each other over such trifles? Why, 
when an ancient triviality is 
proved to be the cause of trouble, 
don’t people just stop fighting? 

But I’m off on wars again — I 
guess because when you’re talk- 
ing about stupidity, wars give you 
too many good examples. So tell 
me — why, when someone’s sure to 
die of an incurable disease and 
needs something for pain — why 
don’t they give him heroin instead 
of morphine? Is it because 
heroin’s habit-forming? What dif- 
ference could that possibly make? 
And besides, morphine is, too. I’ll 
tell you why — it’s because heroin 
makes you feel wonderful and 
morphine makes you feel numb 
and gray. In other words, heroin’s 
fun (mind you, I’m talking about 
terminal cases, dying in agony, not 
normally healthy people) and 
morphine is not — and if it’s fun. 



there must be something evil or 
wrong about it. A dying man is 
not supposed to be made to feel 
good. And laws that keep venereal 
disease from being recognized 
and treated; and laws against 
abortion; and all the obscenity 
statutes — right down at the root 
these are all anti-pleasure laws. 
Would you like the job of explain- 
ing that to a man from Mars, who 
hadn’t been brought up with them? 
He couldn’t follow reasoning like 
that any more than he could under- 
stand why we have never designed 
a heat engine — which is essen- 
tially what an internal combus- 
tion engine is — that can run with- 
out a cooling system — a system 
designed to dissipate heat! 

And lots more. 

So maybe you see what hap- 
pened to me when I read the arti- 
cle about the Class of ’fifty. The 
article peaked a tall pyramid in- 
side me, brought everything to a 
sharp point. 



WWAVE you a pencil?” said the 
young man. All this time and 
he hadn’t yet lost the dazed look. I 
guess it was hard to blame him. 
“Pens are no good on paper nap- 
kins,” he said. 

I handed him my felt-tip. “Try 
this.” 

He tried it. “Hey, this is great. 
This is really keen.” A felt-tip does 
fine on paper napkins. He studied 
it as if he had never seen such a 



DAZED 



39 




thing before. “Really keen,” he 
said again. Then he drew this: 

€ 

“Yingyang,” 1 said. “Right?” 

He nodded. “One of the oldest 
symbols on Earth. Then you know 
what it means.” 

“Well, some anyway. All 
opposites — life and death, light and 
dark, male and female, heavy and 
light-^anything that has an op- 
posite.” 

“That’s it,” he said. “Well, let 
me show you something.” Using 
another napkin, folded in two, as 
a straightedge, he lay it across the 
symbol. 

“You see, if you were to travel in 
a straight line across a diame- 
ter — any diameter — you’d have to 
go on both black and white some- 
where along the way. You can’t go 
all the way on just one color with- 
out bending the line or going a 
short way, less than the diameter. 

“Now let’s say this circle is the 
board on which the game of hu- 
man affairs is played. The straight 
line can be any human course — a 
life, a marriage, a philosophy, a 
business. The optimum course is 
a full diameter, and that’s what 
most people naturally strive for; a 
few might travel short chords or 
bent ones — sick ones. Most people 
can and do travel the diameter. 
For each person, life, marriage. 



whatever, there’s a different 
starting point and a different ar- 
rival point, but if they travel the 
one straight line that goes through 
the center, they will travel black 
country exactly as much as white, 
ying as much as yang. The balance 
is perfect, no matter where you 
start or which way you go. Got it?” 

“I see what you mean,” I said. 
“Your coffee’s cold.” 

“So’s yours. Now look: suppose 
some force came along and shifted 
one of these colors away from the 
center point, like this — ” And he 
drew again. 

o 

We studied his drawing. He drew 
well and quickly. 

He said, “You see, if the shift 
were gradual, then from the very 
second it began there would be 
some people — some lives, philoso- 
phies — who would no longer have 
that perfect balance between 
black and white, between ying and 
yang. Nothing wrong with the 
course they traveled — they still aim 
for the very center and pass on 
through. 

“And if the shift continued to 
where I’ve drawn it, you can see 
that some people might travel all 
the way on the white only. 

“And that’s what has happened 
to us. That’s the answer to what 
seems to be human stupidity. 



40 



GALAXY 




There’s nothing wrong with peo- 
ple! Far and away most of them 
want to travel that one straight 
line, and they do. It isn’t their fault 
that the rules have been changed 
and that the only way to the old 
balance for anyone is to travel a 
course that is sick or twisted or 
short. 

“The coffee is cold. Oh, God, 
I’ve been running off at the 
mouth. You’ll want to get back to 
the office.” 

“No, I won’t,” I said. “The hell 
with it. You go on.” For some- 
where along the line he had filled 
me with a deep, strange excite- 
ment. The things that he said had 
plagued him all his life — or things 
like them — had plagued me, too. 
How often had I stood in a voting 
booth, trying to decide between 
Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum, 
the Big Endians versus the Little 
Endians? Why can’t you tell some- 
one, “Honesty is the best policy — ” 
or “do as you would be done by — ” 
and straighten his whole life out, 
even when it might make the dif- 
ference between life and death? 
Why do people go on smoking 
cigarettes? Why is a woman’s 
breast — which for thousands of art- 
ists has been a source of beauty and 
for millions of children the source 
of life — regarded as obscene? 
Why do we manipulate to in- 
crease the cost of this road or that 
scl\pol so we can “bring in Federal 
money” as if the Federal money 
weren’t coming from our own 



pockets? And since most people try 
to be decent and honest and 
kind — why do they do the stupid 
things they do? 

What in the name of God put us 
into Viet Nam? What are ghettoes 
all about? Why can’t the honest 
sincere liberals just shut up and 
quietly move into the ghettoes 
any time they can guarantee that 
someone from the ghetto can take 
their place in the old neighbor- 
hood — and keep right on doing it 
until there are no more ghettoes? 
Why can’t they establish a coun- 
try called Suez out of territory on 
both sides of the canal — and popu- 
late it from Israel and all the Arab 
countries and all the refugees and 
finance it with canal tolls and put 
in atomic power plants to de-salt 
seawater and make the desert 
bloom, and forbid weapons and 
this-or-that “quarters” and ha- 
tred? In other words, why are 
simple solutions always im- 
possible? Why is any solution that 
does not involve killing people un- 
acceptable? What makes us under- 
copulate and overbreed when the 
perfect balance is available to 
everybody? 

And at this weary time of a quiet 
morning in the Automat, 1 was 
pinioned by the slender bright 
shard of hope that my dazed friend 
had answers. 

Go back to the office? Really, 
the hell with it. 

“You go ahead,” I said, and he 
did.

Ill 

W ELL, okay [he went on], I read 
that article about the class of 
’50 — the Silent Generation — and 
I began to get mad-scared, and it 
grew and grew until I felt I had to 
do something about it. If the class 
of ’50 ever got to run things, they’d 
have the money, they’d have the 
power. In a very real sense they’d 
have the guns. It would be the be- 
ginning of a long period — maybe 
forever — of more-of-the-same- 
ness. There didn’t seem any way to 
stop it. 

Now I’d worked out this 
yingyang theory when I was a 
college sophomore, because it 
was the only theory that would fit 
all the facts. Given that some force 
had shifted the center, good 
people, traveling straight the way 
they should, had to do bad things 
because they could never, never 
achieve that balance. There was 
only one thing 1 didn’t know. 

What force had moved the 
center? 

I sat in the office, dithering and 
ignoring my work, and tried to put 
myself together. Courage, mon 
camarade, le diable est mart, is 
what I said to myself. That mean 
anything to you? 

No? 

Okay — when 1 was a kid I read a 
book called The Cloister and the 
Hearth, by Charles Reade. It was 
about a kid raised in a monastery 
who went into the world — an eight- 



eenth-century kind of world, or 
earlier, I forget now. Anyway, 
one of the people he meets is a 
crazy Frenchman, always kick- 
ing up his heels and cheering 
people up and at the worst of times 
that’s what he’d say: Courage, 
buddy — the devil is dead. It stuck 
with me and I used to say it when 
everything fell apart and there 
seemed nowhere to turn and noth- 
ing to grab hold of. I said it now, 
and you know, it was like a flash 
bulb going off between my ears. 

Mind you, it was real things 1 
was fretting about, not myths or 
fantasies or religious principles. 
It was overpopulation and laws 
against fun and the Dust Bowl (re- 
member that? Well, look it up 
some time) and nowhere to put the 
garbage, and greed and killing 
and cruelty and apathy. 

I took a pad of paper and drew 
these same diagrams and sat look- 
ing at them. 1 was very excited, I 
felt I was very near an answer. 

Ying and Yang. Good and 
evil — sure — but nobody who 
understands it would ever assign 
good to one color and bad to the 
other. The whole point is, they 
both have to be there and in per- 
fect balance. Light and dark, male 
and female, closed and open, life 
and death, that-which-is-outgoing 
and that-which-comes-together — 
all of it, everything — opposition, 
balance. 

Well now, for a long time the 
devil has had a bad name. Say a 



42 



GALAXY 




bad press. And why not? Just for 
the sake of argument, say it is the 
yang country he used to rule and 
that is the one that was forced 
aside. Anyone living and think- 
ing in a straight line could spend 
his whole life and career and all his 
thinking in ying country. He’d 
have to know that yang was there, 
but he’d never encounter it, never 
experience it. More than likely 
he’d be afraid of it because that’s 
what ignorance does to people, 
even good people. 

And the ones who did have 
some experience of yang, the de- 
vil’s country, would find much 
more of the other as they went 
along, because the balance would 
be gone. And the more the shift 
went on, the more innocent, well- 
meaning, thoughtful people ran 
the course of their lives and 
thoughts, the worse they would 
think of the devil’s country and the 
worse they would talk about it and 
him. It would get so you couldn’t 
trust the books; they’d all been 
written from the one point of view, 
the majority side of imbalance. 
It would begin to look as if the 
yang part of the universe were a 
blot which had to be stamped out 
to make a nice clean all-ying uni- 
verse — and you have your John 
Knox types and your Cotton Ma- 
thers; just good people traveling 
straight and strong and acting 
from evidence that was all wrong 
by reason that couldn’t be ration- 
al. 



And I thought. That’s it! 

The devil is dead! 

I have to do something about it. 

But what? 

Tell somebody, that’s what. Tell 
everybody, but let’s be practical. 
There must be somebody, some- 
where, who knows what to do 
about it — or at least how to ex- 
plain about the yingyang and how 
it’s gone wrong, so that everybody 
could rethink what we’ve done, 
what we’ve been. 

Then I remembered the Saturday 
Review. The Saturday Review has 
a personals column in it that’s read 
by all sorts of people — ^judging by 
the messages. But 1 mean all kinds 
of people. If I could write the right 
ad, word it just the right way . 

I felt like a damn fool. Year of 
Our Lord 1950, turning all my 
skills as a professional copy- 
writer to telling the world that the 
devil was dead, but it was an ob- 
session, you see, and I had to do 
something, even something in- 
sane. I had to start somewhere. 

So I wrote the ad. 

THE TROUBLE IS the light-bear- 
er’s torch is out and we’re all on the 
same end of the seesaw. Help or 
we’ll die of it. Whoever knows the 
answer call DU6-1212 Extension 
2103. 

I’m not going to tell you how 
many drafts I wrote or all the rea- 
sons why, copywise, that was best, 
mixed metaphors and all. 1 knew 



DAZED 



43 




that whoever could help would 
know what I was asking. 

N OW comes the hard part. For 
you, I mean, not me. Me, 1 did 
what I had to. You’re going to have 
to believe it. 

Well, maybe you don’t have to. 
Just — well, just suspend disbelief 
until you hear me out, okay? 

All right. I wrote up the copy 
and addressed an envelope. I put 
on a stamp and a special delivery. 
1 put in the copy and a check. I 
sealed it and crossed the hall — you 
know where the mail chute 
is — right across from my door. 
Your door. It was late by then, 
everyone had gone home and my 
footsteps echoed and I could hear 
that funny whistle under the ele- 
vator doors. I slid the envelope in- 
to the slot and let go, and my 
phone rang. 

I’d never heard it ring quite like 
that before. I can say that, yet I 
can’t tell you how it was different. 

I sprinted into the office and sat 
down and picked up the phone. 
I’m glad I sat down first. 

There was this Voice . 

I have a hell of an ear, you 
know that? I’ve thought a lot about 
that Voice and recalled it to my- 
self and I can tell you what it was 
made of — a tone, its octave and 
the fifth harmonic. I mean if you 
can imagine a voice made of three 
notes, two an octave apart and the 
third reinforcing, but not really 
three notes at all, because they 



sounded absolutely together like 
one. Then, they weren’t pure notes, 
but voice-tones, with all the over- 
tones that means. And none of that 
tells you anything either, any more 
than if I described the physical 
characteristics of a vibrating string 
and the sound it produced — when 
the string happened to be on a cello 
played by Pablo Casals. You know 
how it is in a room full of people 
when you suddenly become aware 
of a single voice that commands 
attention because of what it is, not 
what it says. When a. voice like 
that has, in addition, something to 
say — well, you listen. 

I listened. The first thing 1 
heard — I didn’t even have a chance 
to say hello — was: “You’re right. 
You’re absolutely right.” 

I said, “Who is this?” and the 
Voice sighed a little and waited. 

Then it said, “Let’s not go into 
that. It would be best if you fig- 
ured it out by yourself.” 

As things turned out, that was a 
hundred percent on target. I think 
if the Voice hadn’t taken that tack 
I’d have hung up, or anyway wast- 
ed a lot of time in being convinced. 

The Voice said, “What matters 
is your ad in the Saturday Re- 
view.” 

“1 just mailed it!” 

“I just read it,” the Voice said, 
then explained: “Time isn’t quite 
the same here.” At least I think 
that’s what it said. It said, “How 
far are you willing to go to make 
everything right again?” 



44 



GALAXY 




I didn’t know what to say. I re- 
member holding the phone away 
from my face and looking at it as 
if it could tell me something. Then 
I listened again. The Voice told 
me everything I was going 
through, carefully, not bored ex- 
actly but the way you explain to a 
child that you know what’s bother- 
ing him. 

The Voice said, “You know who 
I am but you won’t think the 
words. You don’t want to believe 
any part of this but you have to and 
you know you will. You’re so 
pleased with yourself for being 
right that you cannot think 
straight — which is only one of the 
reasons you can’t think straight. 
Now pull yourself together and 
answer my question.” 

I couldn’t remember the 
question, so I had to be asked once 
more — how far was I willing to go 
to make everything right again? 

You have to understand that this 
Voice meant what it said. If you’d 
heard it, you’d have believed 
it — anybody would. I know I was 
being asked to make a commit- 
ment and that was pretty scary, but 
over and above that I knew I was 
being told that everything could be 
made right again — that the crazy 
tilt that had been plaguing man- 
kind for hundreds, maybe thou- 
sands of years could be fixed. And 
I might be the guy to do it — me, for 
God’s sake. 

If I had any doubts, any this- 
can’t-be kind of feelings — they 



disappeared. How far would I go? 

I said, “All the way.” 

The Voice said, “Good. If this 
works you can take the credit. If it 
doesn’t you take the blame — and 
you’ll have to live with the idea that 
you might have done it and you 
failed. I won’t be able to help you 
with that.” 

I said, anyway I’d know I’d 
tried. 

The Voice said, “Even if you 
succeed you may not like what has 
to be done.” 

I said, “Suppose I don’t do 
it — what will happen?” 

The Voice said, “You ever read 
1984T 

I said I had. 

The Voice said, “Like that, only 
more so and sooner. There isn’t 
any other way it can go now.” 

That s what I’d been thinking — 
that’s what had upset me when I 
read the article. 

“I’ll do it,” is all I said. 

The Voice said that was fine. 

It said “I’m going to send you to 
see somebody. You have to per- 
suade him. He won’t talk to me 
and he’s the only one who can do 
anything.” 

I began to have cold feet. “But 
who is he? Where? What do I say?” 

“You know what to say. Or I 
wouldn’t be talking to you.” 

1 asked, “What do I have to 
do?” 

And all I was told was to take 
the elevator. Then the line went 
dead.

S o I turned out the lights and 
went to the door — and then 1 re- 
membered and went back for my 
drawings of the yingyang, one as 
it ought to be and the other, show- 
ing it out of balance. I held them 
like you’d hold an airline ticket on 
a first flight. I went to the eleva- 
tors. 

How am I going to make you be- 
lieve this? 

Well, you’re right — it doesn’t 
matter if you do or not. Okay, 
here’s what happened. 

I pushed the call button and the 
door opened instantly, the way it 
does once in a while. I stepped into 
the elevator and turned around — 
and there I was. 

The door hadn’t closed, the car 
hadn’t moved. It all happened 
when I was turning around. The 
door was open, but not in the hall- 
way on the twenty-first floor. The 
scene was gray. Hard gray out- 
door ground and gray mist. I stood 
a while looking out and my heart 
was thumping like someone was 
pounding me on the back with 
fists. But nothing happened, so I 
stepped out. 

I was scared. 

Nothing happened. The gray fog 
was neither still nor blowing. 
Sometimes there seemed to be 
shapes out there somewhere — 
trees, rocks, buildings — but then 
there was nothing and maybe it 
was all a vast plain. It had an out- 
doors feel to it — that’s all I can 
say for sure. 



The elevator door was solidly be- 
hind me, which was reassuring. I 
took one step away from it — a lit- 
tle one. I’ll have you know — and 
called out. It took three tries be- 
fore my voice would work. 

“Lucifer!” 

A voice answered me. Somehow 
it wasn’t as — well, as grand as the 
one I’d heard over the phone, but in 
other ways it was bigger. 

It said, “Who is that? What do 
you want?” 

It was cranky. It was the voice of 
someone interrupted, someone who 
felt damn capable of handling the 
interruption, too. And this time 
there really was something loom- 
ing closer through the fog. 

I clapped my hands over my 
face. 1 felt my knees hit the gray 
dirt. I didn’t kneel down, you 
understand. The knees just 
buckled as if they didn’t belong to 
me any more. But hell, the wings. 
Bat’s wings, leathery, and a tail 
with a point on it like a big arrow- 
head. That face, eyes. And thirty 
feet tall, man! 

He touched my shoulder and I 
would have screamed like a school- 
girl if I’d had the breath for it. 

“Come on now.” It was a dif- 
ferent voice altogether — he’d 
changed it — but it was his all the 
same. He said, “1 don’t look like 
that. That came out of your head. 
Here — look at me.” 

I looked. I guess it was funny, 
me kind of peeping up quickly so 
in case it was more than I could 



46 



GALAXY 




take I could hide my face again — 
as if that would do any good. But 
I’d had more than I could handle. 

What I saw was a middle-aged 
guy in a buff corduroy jacket and 
brown slacks. He had graying hair 
and a smooth suntanned forehead 
and the brightest blue eyes I have 
ever seen. He helped me to my feet. 

He said, “1 don’t look like this 
either, but — ” he shrugged and 
smiled. 

I said, “Well, thanks anyway — ’’ 
and felt stupid. I looked around at 
the fog. “Where is this?’’ 

He kind of waved his hand. “1 
can’t really say. Where would you 
want it to be?” 

How do you answer a question 
like that? I couldn't. 

He could. He put the back of his 
hand against my cheek and gently 
turned my face toward him and 
bent close. He did something I can 
only describe as what you do when 
you pick up a magazine and run 
your thumb across the edge of the 
pages and flip it open somewhere. 
Only he did it inside my head 
somehow. Anyway there was a 
blaze of golden light that made me 
blink. 

W HEN I got my eyes adjusted 
to it the gray was gone. When 1 
was a kid I worked one year on a 
farm in Vermont. I used to go for 
the cows in the late afternoon. The 
day pasture was huge, with a stand 
of pine at the upper end and the 
whole thing was steep as a roof. 



with granite outcroppings all 
over, gray, and white limestone. 
That’s where we were, the vdty 
smell of it, the little lake with the 
dirt road around the end of it far 
down at the bottom and the wind 
hissing through the pine trees up 
there and a woodchuck ducking 
out of sight on the skyline. I could 
even see three of the Holsteins, 
standing level on the sidehill in 
that miraculous way they have as 
if they had two short legs and two 
long ones. 1 never did figure out 
how they do it. 

And I got a flash of panic, too, 
because my elevator door was 
gone — but he seemed to know and 
just waved his hand casually over 
to my left. And there it was, a 
Rockefeller Center elevator door 
in the middle of a Vermont pas- 
ture. Funny. When I was fourteen 
that door in the pasture would 
have scared the hell out of me. 
Now I was scared without it. I 
looked around me and smelled the 
late August early evening and 
marveled. 

“It’s so real,” is what I said. 

“Seems real.” 

“But I was here — right here — 
when I was a kid.” 

“Seemed real then, too, didn’t 
it?” 

I think he was trying to make me 
rethink all along the line — not so 
much to doubt things, but to wipe 
everything clean and start over. 

“Belief or nonbelief has no 
power over objective truth,” is 



DAZED 



47 




what he told me. He said that if 
two people believe the same thing 
from the same evidence, it means 
that they believe the same thing, 
nothing more. 

While I was chewing on that he 
took the sketches out of my 
hand — the same ones 1 just did for* 
you. I had quite forgotten I was 
holding them. He looked at them 
and grunied. “It’s like that, is it?” 

1 took back the sketches and 
began to make my speech. 

I said, “You see, it’s like this. 
Here the balance is — ” and he 
kind of laughed a little and said 
wait, wait, we don’t have to go 
through all that. 

I think he meant, words. I mean 
he touched the side of my face 
again and made me face him and 
did that thing with his eyes inside 
my head. Only this time it was like 
taking both your thumbs and pull- 
ing open the pages of a book 
that are sort of stuck together. I 
wouldn’t say it hurt but I wouldn’t 
want much more of it either. 1 
remember a single flash of shame 
that things I’d read, studied, things 
I’d thought out. I’d been careless 
with or had forgotten. And all the 
while — a very short while — he was 
digging in my head he was curing 
the shame, too. I began to under- 
stand that what he could get from 
me wasn’t just what I’d learned and 
understood — it was everything, 
everything that had ever passed 
through my pipeline. And all in a 
moment. 



Then he stepped back and said, 
“Bastard!” 

I thought, what have I done? 

He laughed at me. “Not you. 
Him. ” 

I thought, oh. The Voice on the 
phone. The one who sent me. 

He looked at me with those 
sixty-thousand candlepower eyes 
and laughed again and wagged his 
head. 

“I swore I’d have nothing to do 
with him any more,” he said, “and 
now look — he’s thrown me a 
hook.” 

I guess 1 looked mixed-up, be- 
cause I was. He began to talk to 
me kindly, trying to make me feel 
better. 

He said, “It’s not easy to ex- 
plain. You’ve learned so much that 
just ain’t so and you’ve learned it 
from people who also didn’t under- 
stand. Couldn’t. It goes back a 
long time. I mean, for you it does. 
For me — well, time is different 
here.” 

He thought a bit and said, “Call- 
ing me Lucifer was real bright of 
you, you know that? Lucifer 
means ‘bringer of light.’ If you’re 
going to stick with the yingyang 
symbol — and it’s a good one — 
you’ll see that there’s a center for 
the dark part and a center for the 
light — sometimes they’re drawn in, 
a little dot on each part right where 
a pollywog’s eye would be. I am 
that dot and the Voice you heard 
is the other one. Lucifer I may be, 
but I’m not the devil. I’m just the

other. It takes two of us to make 
the whole. What 1 just might have 
overlooked is that it takes two of 
us to keep the whole. Really, I had 
no idea — ” and he leaned forward 
a got another quick look inside my 
head — ” no idea at all that things 
would get into such a mess so 
quickly. Maybe I shouldn’t have 
left.” 

1 had to ask him. “Why did 
you?” 



H e said, “I got mad. I had a 
crazy notion one day and want- 
ed to try something and he didn’t 
want me to do it. But I did it any- 
way and then when it got me into 
trouble he wouldn’t pull me out of 
it. I had to play it all the way 
through. It hurt.” He laughed a 
funny laugh. I understood that ‘it 
hurt’ was a gigantic understate- 
ment. “So I got mad and cut out 
and came here. He’s been yelling 
and sending messages and all, ever 
since, but I paid him no mind until 
you.” 

“Why me?” 

“Yes,” he said, “why you?” He 
thought it over. “Tell me some- 
thing — have you got anything to 
keep you where you are? I mean a 
wife or a career or kids or some- 
thing that would get hurt if you 
suddenly disappeared?” 

“Nothing like that, no. Some 
friends — but no wife, no folks. And 
my job’s just a job.” 

“Thought so,” he said. Talking 



to himself, he said, “Bastard. 
Built this one from the ground up, 
he did. Knew damn well I’d get a 
jolt when I saw what a rotten mess 
this was.” Then he said very warm- 
ly, “Don’t take that personally. 
You can’t help it.” 

I couldn’t help it. I couldn’t help 
taking it a little personally either. 

Maybe I was a little sharp when 
1 said, “Well — are you going to 
come back or not?” 

He gave it right back to me. 

“I really don’t know,” he said. 
“Why don’t I leave it to you? You 
decide.” 

“Me?” 

“Why not? You got yourself 
into this.” 

“Did I?” 

“No matter how carefully he set 
you up for it, friend, he had to get 
your permission first. Right?” 

I remembered that Voice; How 
far are you willing to gol 

The one I had called Lucifer 
fixed me with the blazing eyes. “I 
am going to lay it right on you. I 
will do what you say. If you tell me 
to stay here, to stay out of it, it’s 
going to be like Orwell said: ‘To 
visualize the future you must vis- 
ualize a boot stamping eternally 
on a human face.’ But if I come 
back it’s going to be almost as 
bad. Things are really out of hand, 
so much that it can’t be straight- 
ened out overnight. It would take 
years. People aren’t made to take 
the truth on sight and act on it.

pushed — usually by being made so 
miserable in so many ways that 
they get mad. When enough of 
them get mad enough they’ll find 
the way.” 

“Well, good, then.” 

He mimicked me. 1 think he was 
a little sore and just maybe he 
didn’t want to go back to work. 

“ ‘Well, good then,’ ” he mocked 
me. “We’ll have to shovel stupid- 
ity on them. We’ll have to get them 
into long meaningless wars. We’ll 
make them live under laws that ab- 
solutely make no sense and keep 
passing more of them. We’ll lay 
taxes on them until they can’t have 
luxuries and comforts without 
getting into trouble and we’ll lay 
on more until it hurts to buy 
enough just to live.” 

1 said, “That’s the same thing as 
the boot!” 

He said, “No it isn’t. Let the 
class of ’50 take over and you’ll 
have that. Orwell said eternally 
and he was right. No conflict, no 
dissent, no division, no balance. 
If 1 come back, there’ll be plenty of 
all that. People will die — lots of 
them. And hurt — plenty.” 

“There’s no other way?” 

“Look,” he said, “you can’t give 
people what they want. They have 
to earn it or take it. When they 
start doing that there’ll be bomb- 
ings and riots and people — es- 
pecially young people — will do 
what they want to and what works 
for them, not what they’re told. 
They’ll find their own ways — and it 



won’t be anything like what 
grandpa said.” , 

I thought about all that and then 
about the class of ’50 and the 
stamping boot. 

“Come back,” I said. 

He sighed and said, “Oh, God.” 

I don’t know what he meant. But 
I think he was glad. 

S UDDENLY — well, it seemed 
sudden — there was more light 
outside the Automat than inside. I 
felt as dazed as my friend looked. 

I said, “And what have you been 
doing since nineteen fifty?” 

He said, “Don’t you understand? 
All this happened last night! Last 
night was nineteen fifty! I got 
back into the elevator and walked 
into my — ypur — the office and 
there you were!” 

“And the dev — Lucif — whoever 
it was, he’s back, too?” 

“Time is different for him. He 
came back right away. You’ve al- 
ready told me enough about what’s 
been happening since then. He’s 
back. He’s been back. Things are 
moving toward the center again. 
It’s hard to do, but it’s happen- 
ing.” 

I stuck my spoon into my cold 
old coffee and swirled it around 
and thought of the purposeless 
crime and the useless deaths and 
the really decent people who didn’t 
know they were greedy, and a deep 
joy began to kindle inside me. 

“Then maybe it’s not all use- 
less.”

“Oh, God, it better not be,” he 
whispered. “Because all of it is 
my fault.” 

“No it isn’t. Things are going to 
be all right.” As I said that I was 
sure of it. I looked at him, so lost 
and dazed — and I thought, / am 
going to help this guy. I am going 
to help him help me to under- 
stand better, to work out how we 
can bring it all into balance again. 
1 wondered if he knew he was a 
messiah, that he had saved the 
world. I don’t think he did. 

Sudden thought: “Hey,” I said. 



“did he tell you why he dropped 
out mad like that? What was it — he 
did something the other one didn’t 
want him to do?” 

“Didn’t I mention that? Sorry,” 
said the dazed man. “He got tired 
of being a — a force. Whatever you 
call it. Spirit. He wanted to be a 
man for a while, to see what it was 
like. He could do it — but he 
couldn’t get out of it again without 
the other’s help. So he walked 
around for a while as a man — ” 
“And?” 

“And got crucified.” ★

Jack Williamson, one of science fiction's 
real old-timers, now enjoys two careers — col- 
lege teaching and writing st. Born in 1908, 
Jack saw his first story, “The Metal Man," 
appear in the December, 1928, issue of 
Amazing Stories. Since then he has had well 
over three million words of sf published, in- 
cluding more than twenty novels. 

Returning to college in the late 1950s, he 
picked up his A.B. (summa cum iaude) and 
his M.A., then went on to earn his Ph.D. in 
1964 with a thesis on H. G. Wells. Jack is now 
an associate professor of English at Eastern 
New Mexico University in his home town of 
Portales. At the university Jack inaugurated 
one of the flrst college-level courses in sf as 
literature. 

‘'Theoretically, I suppose,” Jack tells us, 
“I should be writing westerns. I was born in 
the mining-and-cattle town of Bisbee in the 
Arizona Territory. We lived on a cattle ranch 
in the mountainous wilds of Sonora until the 
Mexican Revolution and then moved by cov- 
ered wagon to New Mexico when I was sev- 
en years old. But somehow the world of sci- 




entific possibility always seemed more ex- 
citing to me than the rather grim real world. 
I started writing science fiction on the sand- 
hill homestead in New Mexico before I went 
off to college, and I don’t hope to get over 
it . .”

COMMODORE GRIMES 
NOVELETTE 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 



I 

C APTAIN JOHN GRIMES 
stood impassively in the port 
wing of his bridge as his ship, the 
round-the-world tramp Sonya 
Winneck, slid gently toward her 
berth- but although his stocky 
body was immobile, his brain was 
active. He was gauging speed, 
distances, the effect of the tide. 
His engines were stopped, but the 
vessel still seemed to be carrying 
too much way. He was stemming 
the ebb but, according to the Port 
Directions, there was some- 
times — not always -an eddy, a 
counter-current, along this line of 
wharfage. In any case the clock- 
ing would be a tight fit. Ahead of 
him was Iron Baron, one of the 
steel trade ships, a huge, beamy 
brute with gigantic deck cranes al- 
most capable of lifting her by her 
own bootstraps. In the berth 
astern was the Lone Star Line’s 
Orionic, with even more beam to 
her than the Baron. 

“Port," ordered Grimes. “Hard 
over.” 



52 




“Hard aport, sir,” replied the 
quartermaster. 

Sonya Winneck was accosting 
the wharf at a fairly steep angle 
now, her stem aimed at a bollard 
just abaft Iron Baron's stern. 
Grimes lifted his whistle to his lips 
and blew' one short, sharp blast. 
From the fo’c’s’le head came the 
rattle of chain cable as the star- 
board anchor was let go, then one 
stroke of the bell to signal that the 
first shackle was in the pipe. 

Grimes looked aft. Sonya 
Winneck' s quarter was now clear 
of Orionic's bows. “Midships. 
Slow astern.” 

He heard the replies of the man 
at the wheel and the Third Officer. 
He felt the vibration as the re- 
versed screw bit into the water. But 
would “slow astern” be enough? 
He was about to order “half 
astern,” then realized that this was 
what he was getting, if not more. 
The transverse thrust of the screw 
threw Sonya Winneck's stern to 
port even as her headway was 
killed. Already a heaving line was 
ashore forward and, snaking after 
it, the first of the mooring lines. 
Aft, the Second Mate was ready 
to get his first line ashore. 

“Stop her,” ordered Grimes. 
“That will do the wheel, thank 
you.” 

On fo’c’s’le head and poop the 
self-tensioning winches were 
whining. Grimes, looking down 
from the bridge wing to the mark- 



er flag on the wharf, saw that he 
was exactly in position. He made 
the traditional arms-crossed- 
above-the-head gesture - A/aA:e 
her fast as she is — to the Chief Of- 
ficer forward, the Second Officer 
aft. Then he walked slowly into the 
wheelhouse. The Third Officer 
was still standing by the engine 
control pedestal. 

“Finished with engines, Mr. 
Denham,” said Grimes coldly. 

“Finished with engines, sir.” The 
young man put the lever to that 
position. A jangling of bells 
drifted up from below. 

“Mr. Denham- ” 

“Sir?” The officer’s voice was an 
almost inaudible squeak. He 
looked frightened- and, thought 
Grimes, well he might be. 

“Mr. Denham, I am well aware 
that in your opinion Tm an out- 
sider who should never have been 
appointed to command this 
vessel. I am well aware, too, that in 
your opinion at least your local 
knowledge far surpasses mine. 
Even so, 1 shall be obliged if you 
will carry out my orders, although 
you will still have the right, the 
obligation, in fact, to query 
them—but not when I’m in the 
middle of berthing the bloody 
ship!” Grimes simmered down. 
“For your information, Mr. Den- 
ham, even I realized that slow 
astern would not be sufficient. 1 
was about to order more stern- 
power — then saw that you had 



SISTERSHIPS 



53 




taken matters into your own 
possibly capable but definitely 
unqualified hands.” 

“But, sir — ” 

Grimes’ prominent ears had red- 
dened. 

“There are no ‘buts.’ ” 

“But, sir, 1 tried to put her to 
‘slow astern.’ The lever jerked out 
of my hand to ‘full.’ ” 

“Thank you, Mr. Denham,” 
said Grimes at last. He knew that 
the young man was not lying. 
“You’d better see the engineer, or 
the electrician, and get those con- 
trols fixed. The next time they 
might do the wrong thing instead 
of the right one.” 

He strode through the chart- 
room and then down to his quar- 
ters. Sonya, who had watched the 
berthing from the lower bridge, 
was waiting for him. She rose 
from her chair as he entered the 
day cabin and stood there, tall, 
slim and graceful. Her right hand 
snapped up to the widow’s peak of 
her shining auburn hair. 

She said, “I salute you, Cap’n. A 
masterly piece of shiphandling.” 
Grimes grunted. 

“It was like something out of 
one of your own books.” She went 
to the case on the bulkhead in 
which were both privately owned 
volumes and those considered by 
the Winneck Line to be fit and 
proper reading for its Masters. 
From the Company’s shelf she 
lifted The Inter-Island Steamer 



Express, by John Grimes. She read 
aloud, “These captains, maintain- 
ing their timetables and berthing 
and unberthing their big, sea-going 
passenger ferries in the most ap- 
palling weather conditions, were 
without doubt among the world’s 
finest shiphandlers.” 

“The weather conditions this 
morning aren’t appalling,” said 
Grimes. “In any case, that was on 
Earth. This is Aquarius.” 

A quarius, as its name im- 
plied, was a watery world. 

It lay in toward the center from 
the Rim Worlds, fifty or so light 
years to the Galactic East of the 
Shakespearian Sector. It was 
Earth-type insofar as gravitation, 
atmosphere and climate were 
concerned, but was geographi- 
cally dissimilar to the Home 
Planet. There were no great land 
masses — only chains of islands, 
some large, some small, some no 
more than flyspecks on even a 
medium-scale chart. In this re- 
spect it was like Mellise, one of the 
planets of the Eastern Circuit. 
Unlike Mellise, it possessed no 
indigenous intelligent life. Men 
had colonized it during the Sec- 
ond Expansion — and, as was the 
case with most Second Expansion 
colonizations, it had been a case of 
discovery and settlement by chance 
rather than by design. Time and 
time again it happened, that dis- 
astrous, often tragic sequence of 



54 



GALAXY 




events. The magnetic storm, the 
gaussjammer thrown light-mil- 
lennia off course, her pile dead and 
the hungry emergency diesels gulp- 
ing precious hydrocarbons to feed 
power to the Ehrenhaft generators, 
the long plunge into and through 
the Unknown, the desperate search 
for a world, any world, that would 
sustain human life . 

Lode Messenger stumbled upon 
Aquarius and made a safe landing 
in the vicinity of the North Mag- 
netic Pole. Like all the later ships 
of her period she carried a stock 
of fertilized ova, human and 
animal, a wide variety of plant 
seeds and an extensive technical 
library. Even when the gaussjam- 
mers were on regular runs, as 
Lode Messenger had been, there 
was always the possibility that 
their people would finish up as 
founders of a new colony. When 
the planet was rediscovered by 
Commodore Shakespeare dur- 
ing his voyage of exploration out 
toward the Rim, the settlement 
was already well established. 
With the Third Expansion it 
accepted its quota of immigrants, 
but insisted that all newcomers 
work for a probationary period in 
the merchant or fishing fleets be- 
fore taking up employment 
ashore if they so wished. Some- 
body once said that if you wanted 
to emigrate to Aquarius you had 
to hold at least an Able Bodied 
Seaman’s papers. This was not 



quite true, but it was not far from 
the truth. It had also been said that 
Aquarians had an inborn dislike 
and distrust of spaceships but 
loved sea-going ships. This was 
true. 

Grimes, although not an immi- 
grant, was a seaman of sorts. He 
was on the planet by invitation, 
having been asked by its rul- 
ers — the Havenmaster and the 
Master Wardens — to write a his- 
tory of the colony. For that he was 
well qualified, being acknowl- 
edged as the leading maritime 
historian specializing in Terran 
marine history in the Rim Worlds. 
His books — The Inter-Island 
Steamer Express, The Flag of the 
Southern Cross, The Western 
Ocean Greyhounds and Times of 
Transition — had sold especially 
well on Aquarius, although in the 
worlds of the Rim Confederacy 
they were to be found mainly only 
in libraries, and in very few librar- 
ies at that. 

And Commodore Grimes, Rim 
Worlds Naval Reserve, Master 
Astronaut, was more than just a 
writer about the sea. He held the 
rank of admiral — honorary, but 
salt water admiral nonethe- 
less — in the Ausiphalian Navy on 
Tharn. Captain Thornton, the 
havenmaster, had said, “Legally 
speaking, that commission of 
yours entitles you to a Certificate 
of Competency as a Master Mar- 
iner. Then you can sail in com- 



SISTERSHIPS 



55 




mand of one of our ships, to get the 
real feel of life at sea.” 

“I’m not altogether happy about 
it, Tom,” Grimes had objected, 
not too strongly. 

“I’m the boss here,” Thornton 
had assured him. “And, in any 
case. I’m not turning you loose 
until you’ve been through crash 
courses in navigation, seamanship, 
meteorology, cargo stowage and 
stability.” 

“I’m tempted,” Grimes had ad- 
mitted. 

“Tempted?” Sonya had scoffed. 
“He’s just dying to strut his bridge 
like the ancient mariners he’s al- 
ways writing about. His only re- 
gret will be that you Aquarians 
didn’t recreate the days of sail 
while you were about it.” 

“Now and again I regret it my- 
self,” admitted the havenmaster. 
“Fore and aft rig, a diesel aux- 
iliary, electrical deck machin- 
ery — there’d be something quite 
fast enough for some of our trades 
and economical to boot. But I’m 
well known as an enemy of pro- 
gress — progress for its own sake, 
that is.” 

“A man after my own heart,” 
said Grimes. 

“You’re just a pair of reaction- 
aries,” Sonya had told them. 

Grimes supposed he was a 
reactionary; but he enjoyed this 
world. It was efficiently run — but 
with ample recognition that there 
were things more important than 



efficiency. There was automa- 
tion — up to a certain point, but up 
to that point only. The havenmas- 
ter had admitted that he was fight- 
ing a rearguard action to try to 
keep control of the ships in the 
hands of the seamen officers. 
There was a love of and respect for 
the sea. Both were understand- 
able. From the very beginning of 
the colony these people had grown 
up on a watery world and the books 
most in demand in their technical 
libraries had been those on ship- 
building, seamanship and navi- 
gation. Aquarius was poor in 
radioactives but rich in mineral 
oil, so the physicists had never 
been able— as they had been on so 
many worlds — to take charge. The 
steam engine and the diesel were 
still the prime movers even in the 
air, where the big passenger-car- 
rying airships did the work that on 
other planets was performed by 
jetplanes and rockets. 

The surface ships were, by mod- 
ern standards, archaic. Very few of 
them ran to bow-thrusters — and 
those only ferries, cargo and pas- 
senger, to which the strict adher- 
ence to a timetable was of para- 
mount importance, whose masters 
could not afford to make a leisure- 
ly job of backing into a roll-on- 
roll-off berth and therefore re- 
quired the additional maneuvering 
aid. There was some containeriza- 
tion, but it was not carried to ex- 
tremes, it being recognized that 



56 



GALAXY 




the personnel of the cargo-carriers 
were entitled to leisure time in 
port. Self-tensioning winches and, 
for cargo handling, cranes rather 
than derricks cut down the number 
of hands required on deck and en- 
ginerooms were almost fully auto- 
mated, with bridge control for 
arrival and departure maneuvers. 

There were electronic naviga- 
tional aids a-plenty — radar, 
echometer, loran, shoran, an iner- 
tial system, position-fixing by 
artificial satellite — but these the 
havenmaster frowned upon, as did 
most of the senior shipmasters. 
Thornton quoted from Grimes’ 
own book. Times of Transition-. 
“The electronic wizards of the 
day, who were not seamen, failed 
to realize that a competent navi- 
gator, armed only with sextant, 
chronometer and ephemeris, to- 
gether with a reasonably accurate 
log, can always fix the position of 
his ship with reasonable accuracy 
provided that there is an occa- 
sional break in the clouds for an 
identifiable celestial body to shine 
through. Such a navigator is never 
at the mercy of a single fuse.” 

“And our being at the mercy of 
machinery, John, is what I’m try- 
ing to avoid,” said Thornton. 
“Unless we’re careful our ships 
will be officered by mere button 
pushers, incapable of running a 
series of P/Ls. Unluckily, not all 
the Master Wardens think as I do. 
Too many of them are engineers 



and businessmen — and in my 
experience such people have far 
less sales resistance than we sim- 
ple sailors.” 

“And what dogs have they been 
sold?” asked Grimes. 

“One that’s a real bitch — from 
my viewpoint and probably from 
yours. Y ou’ve heard of Elektra?” 
“Yes,” broke in Sonya. “Carin- 
thian Sector. Third Expansion 
colonization.” She grinned a little 
unkindly. “It’s a planet where the 
minimum qualification for 
immigration is a doctorate in one 
of the sciences, preferably physics. 
But they have to let in occasional 
chemists, biologists and the like to 
keep the dump habitable.” 

“And they have quite a few now 
with degrees in salesmanship,” 
went on the havenmaster. “One of 
them was here, a few years back.” 
“And he sold you this female 
pup?” Grimes asked. 

“He did that. The Purcell Navi- 
gator. It’s named, I suppose, after 
its inventor. It’s a sealed box, with 
the gods know what sort of mess of 
memory fields and the like inside 
it. It’s hooked up to all the ship’s ' 
electronic navigational gear — gy- 
rocompass, radar, echometer, 
loran, shoran — ^just name a pie 
and it’s got a finger in it. Or a ten- 
tacle. It knows just where the ship 
is at any given second. If you ask 
it nicely it might condescend to 
tell you.” 

“You don’t like it,” said Grimes. 



SISTERSHIPS 



57 




“I don’t like it. To begin with, 
some of the shipowners — and this 
is a private enterprise planet, 
remember — feel that now the 
bridge can be automated to the 
same extent as the engineroom, 
with just one man, the master, in 
charge, snoring his head off on the 
chartroom settee and being awak- 
ened by an alarm bell just in time 
to rub the sleep out of his eyes and 
take his ship into port. But that’s 
not the worst of it. Now the Insti- 
tute of Marine Engineers is say- 
ing, Tf navigation is only a matter 
of pushing buttons we’re at least 
as well qualified as deck offi- 
cers.’ ” 

“I’ve heard that often enough,” 
said Grimes. “Even in Space.” 
“Does anybody know how these 
Purcell Navigators work?” asked 
Sonya. 

“No. One of the terms of sale is 
that they must be installed by tech- 
nicians from the world of manu- 
facture — Elektra. Another is that 
they must not, repeat not, be 
tampered with in any way. As a 
matter of fact the chief electrician 
of the Carrington Yard did try to 
find out what made one tick. He 
was lucky to lose only a hand.” 

“It seems,” said Grimes, “that I 
came here just in time.” 

“What do you mean, John?” 
“Well, 1 shall be able to enjoy 
the last of the old days, the good 
old days, on Aquarius. And I shall 
have the material for a few more 



chapters of my Times of Transi- 
tion.” 

“He likes being morbid,” said 
Sonya. “Almost as much as he 
likes being reactionary.” 

“Mphm,” grunted Grimes. 
“Old-fashioned sounds better.” 

He got up from his chair, walked 
soundlessly over the carpeted 
floor to the bookshelves that 
formed a space-divider in the huge, 
circular room that was called the 
Havenmaster’s Lookout. He 
stared at the rows of books, most 
of them old but in recent print- 
ings, only a few of them new. And 
they were real books, all of them, 
not spools of microfilm; There 
were the standard works on the 
old arts of the seaman, hopelessly 
out of date on most worlds, but not 
yet on this one — Brown, Nicholl, 
Norie, Riesenberg, Lecky, 
Thomas — and the chronicles of 
the ancient explorers and navi- 
gators — Hakluyt, Dampier, 

Cook, Flinders, Bligh. Then there 
were the novels — Conrad of 
course, McFee, Monsarrat, Her- 
man Wouk, Forester. Grime’s 
hand went out to Melville’s Moby 
Dick and he remembered that odd 
Hall of Fame to which he had been 
whisked from the mountaintop 
on Kinsolving — and felt regret 
that he had not been able to meet 
Lieutenant Commander Queeg, 
Admiral Lord Hornblower and 
Captain Ahab. Were there white 
whales in the Aquarian seas? 



58 



GALAXY 




He turned, saw that his wife and 
Captain Thornton had risen from 
their own seats and were standing, 
staring out through the huge win- 
dow that formed the entire outer 
wall of the Lookout that, in its 
turn, was the top level of the two- 
thousand-foot-high control tower. 
Above the Lookout towered only 
the mast from which sprouted an- 
tennae, radar scanners, anemo- 
meters and the like, was topped by 
the powerful, group-flashing Steep 
Island Light. 

Grimes walked slowly to join 
Sonya and his host, gazing out 
through the clear glass into the 
darkness. At regular intervals, 
the beam of the Light, a sword of 
misty radiance, swept overhead. 
Far to the south a loom of lumi- 
nescence on the distant sea hori- 
zon was Port Stellar, and to east 
and west, fainter still, were other 
hazy luminosities — island cities, is- 
land states. Almost directly below 
was a great passenger liner, from 
this height no more than a gaudy, 
glittering insect crawling over 
the black carpet of the sea. 

In spite of the insulation and the 
sound-proofing, the thin, high 
whine of the wind was audible 
here. 

Sonya shivered. “The winds of 
change are blowing, "she whispered. 

“A seaman should be able to 
cope with the wind,” said the 
havenmaster. “I wonder how 
you’ll cope, John? I’ve arranged 



for you to take over Sonya Win- 
neck at Port Stellar tomorrow.” 
“I’ll get by,” said Grimes. 

“He always does,” said Sonya. 
“Somehow.” 

II 

G rimes fell in love with Sonya 
Winneck upon first sight. She 
was, of course, his first sea com- 
mand. Nonetheless, she made an 
immediate appeal to the eye, 
even to the eye of one who, for 
all his admiral’s commission, had 
very little practical knowledge of 
ocean-going ships. The lady was a 
tramp — but the tramp was also a 
lady. 

She was five hundred feet long 
overall, with a seventy-foot beam. 
Bridge and funnel — this latter 
scarlet, with a black top and two 
narrow black bands — were amid- 
ships. Her upperworks and deck 
cranes were white, her hull green 
with a yellow ribbon. The boot- 
topping was red. 

There was more to a ship than 
outward appearance, how- 
ever — and Grimes, himself a ship- 
master of long standing, knew this 
as well as the most seasoned 
master mariner on the oceans of 
Aquarius. But she had, he dis- 
covered, a fair turn of speed, her 
diesel-electric drive pushing her 
through the water at a good twenty 
knots. She was single screw, with a 
right-handed propeller. Her

wheelhouse and chartroom re- 
minded him almost of the space- 
ships that he was accustomed to 
command, but the electronic gad- 
getry was not unfamiliar to him 
after the sessions he had put in on 
the various simulators in the 
havenmaster’s control tower. The 
only thing that he did not like was 
the Purcell Navigator squatting 
like a sinister octopus in its own 
cage abaft the chartroom. Oh, 
well, he would make sure that his 
young gentlemen had no truck 
with the electronic monster — he 
hoped. 

“I don’t like it either,” said the 
tall, skinny, morose Captain Har- 
rell, whom Grimes was relieving. 
“But it works. Even 1 have to ad- 
mit that. It works.” 

Harrell led Grimes down to the 
big, comfortable day cabin where 
the two wives — Mrs. Harrell very 
dumpy and mousy alongside the 
slender Sonya — were waiting. The 
Harrells’ baggage, packed and 
ready to be carried ashore, was 
against one bulkhead. On a table 
stood bottles and glasses, a bowl of 
cracked ice. The officers came in, 
neat in their slate-gray shirt-and- 
shorts uniforms and their black, 
gold-braided shoulderboards, to 
say goodbye to their old captain 
and to greet their new one. There 
was Wilcox, Chief Officer, a 
burly, blond, young — but not too 
young — giant. Andersen, the Sec- 
ond, was another giant, but red- 



haired. Viccini, the Third, was 
slight and dark. Jones, the Engi- 
neer, a fat, bald man who could 
have been any age, came up to be 
introduced with Mary Hales, the 
Electrician, a fragile, silver- 
headed little girl who looked incap- 
able of changing a fuse. Finally 
came Sally Fielding, Steward- 
ess-Purser, plump and motherly. 

Glasses were charged. “Well, 
Captain,” began Harrell. “Or 
should 1 say Commodore, or 
Admiral?” 

“Captain,” Grimes told him. 

“Well, Captain, your name’s on 
the Register and the Articles. 
You’ve signed the Receipt for 
Items Handed Over. You’ve a 
good ship and a good team of offi- 
cers. Happy sailing.” 

“Happy sailing,” everybody re- 
peated. 

“Thank you. Captain,” replied 
Grimes. “And I’m sure that we all 
wish you an enjoyable leave.” 

“And how are you spending it, 
Mrs. Harrell?” asked Sonya. 

“We’ve a yacht,” the other 
woman told her. “Most of the time 
we shall be cruising around the 
Coral Sea.” 

“A busman’s holiday,” com- 
mented Grimes. 

“Not at all,” Harrell told him, 
grinning for the first time. 
“There’ll just be the two of us, so 
there’ll be no crew problems. And 
no electronic gadgetry to get in 
my hair either.”

GALAXY 




“Happy sailing,” said Grimes, 
raising his glass. 

“Happy sailing,” they all said 
again. 

A nd it was happy sailing in the 
beginning. 

It did not take Grimes long to 
find his feet, his sea legs. “After 
all,” he said to Sonya, “a ship is a 
ship is a ship — ” He had been 
afraid at first that his officers and 
crew would resent him, an out- 
sider appointed to command with 
no probationary period in the 
junior grades — but there hung 
about him the spurious glamor of 
that honorary admiral’s com- 
mission, and his reputation as a 
maritime historian earned him re- 
spect. Sonya Winneck's people 
knew that he was on Aquarius to 
do a job, a useful job, and that his 
sailing as master of her was part 
of it. 

Sonya enjoyed herself, too. She 
made friends with the other women 
aboard — with Mary Hales, with 
Sally Fielding, with the darkly 
opulent Vanessa Wilcox who had 
joined just before departure from 
Port Stellar, with Tessa and 
Teena, the Assistant Steward- 
esses, with the massive Jemima 
Brown who was queen of the 
beautifully mechanized galley. 
Shipboard life — surface ship- 
board life — was new to Sonya in 
spite of its inevitable resem- 
blances to life aboard a spaceship. 



She had much to see, much to in- 
quire into. 

The weather was mainly fine, 
with warm days, and nights of 
just sufficient chill to provide a 
pleasant contrast. Grimes played 
with the sextant he had purchq^ed 
in Port Stellar and became skilled 
in its use, taking altitude after 
altitude of the sun, of the planet’s 
two moons, of such stars, planets 
and artificial satellites as were 
visible at morning and evening 
twilight. His officers watched 
with a certain amusement as he 
plotted position after position on 
the working chart, congratulated 
him when these coincided with 
those for the same times shown on 
the chart that was displayed on the 
screen of the Purcell Navigator. 
And he was pleased to note that 
they tended to ignore that con- 
traption, consulting it only when 
there was a wide variance be- 
tween positions taken by two ob- 
servers. 

A shipmaster, however, was 
more than a navigator. Pilotage 
was not compulsory for the ma- 
jority of the ports visited by Sonya 
Winneck, although in each one of 
them pilots were available. Grimes 
had taken a pilot sailing from Port 
Stellar, but after the six-day run 
between that harbor and Tallis- 
port he decided to try to berth the 
ship himself. After all, he had 
spent hours in the simulator and, 
since joining his ship, had read 



SISTER SHIPS 



61 




Ardley’s Harbor Pilotage from 
cover to cover. 

This book, a standard Terran 
Twentieth Century work on the 
handling and mooring of ships, 
had been given him by the haven- 
master, who had said, “You should 
find this useful, John. Ardley was 
one of the authorities of his time. 
One thing I like about him — he 
says that anchors are there to be 
used. For maneuvering, I mean.” 
He laughed, added: “But don’t go 
making too much of a habit of it. It 
annoys Chief Officers!” 

And so, having made a careful 
study of the large-scale chart, the 
plan and the sailing directions. 
Grimes stood in to Tallisport 
shortly after sunrise. The wheel 
was manned, the engines on stand- 
by. According to the Tide Tables 
it was just two hours after first high 
water, which meant that Sonya 
Winneck would be stemming the 
ebb on her way in. But, Wilcox 
had told him, complications were 
bound to crop up in this river-har- 
bor. All wharfage was on the west- 
ern bank of the river, on the star- 
board hand entering — and to 
berth starboard-side-to was to risk 
damage in a vessel with a right- 
handed single screw — especially 
when the master was an inexperi- 
enced shiphandler. Sometimes, 
however, an eddy, a counter-cur- 
rent, set strongly along the line of 
wharfage, giving the effect of 
flood tide. If this eddy were run- 



ning — and only visual observa- 
tion when approaching the berth 
would confirm this or not — Grimes 
would be able to bring the ship’s 
head to starboard — letting go the 
starboard anchor to stub her 
around — and then ease her along- 
side, port-side-to, with the anchor 
still on the bottom. 

G rimes stood in to TalUsport. 

With his naked eye he could now 
see the main leads, two white 
towers, nicely in line. He told the 
harbor quartermaster to steer 
for them, to keep them right ahead. 
Yes, and there was the breakwater 
to port, with its red beacon. The 
red beacon was abeam now and 
Sonya Winneck was sweeping 
into the harbor in fine style. 

“Hadn’t you better reduce 
speed, sir?” suggested the Third 
Officer. 

“Mphm. Thank you, Mr. Vic- 
cini. Better make it slow — no, 
dead slow.” 

“Dead slow, sir.” 

The rhythmic thudding of the 
diesel generators was un- 
changed, but there was a subtle 
diminution of vibration as the 
propeller revolutions decreased. 
The main leads were still ahead, 
but coming abeam to starboard 
were the two white obelisks that 
were the leads into the swinging 
basin. “Port ten degrees,” ordered 
Grimes. Would it be enough? Then 
he saw the ship’s head swinging 



62 



GALAXY 




easily, heard the clicking of the 
gyro-repeater. 

“Midships. Steady.” 

He went out to the starboard 
wing of the bridge and looked aft. 
The Swinging Basin Leads were 
coming into line astern nicely. 

“Steady as you go,” he called. 

Now Sonya Winneck was creep- 
ing up the last navigable reach of 
the river. To starboard was the 
line of wharfage and behind it the 
clumps of greenery, spangled with 
blossoms like jewels, the white- 
walled houses, all clean and bright 
in the morning sun. But Grimes 
had no eye for scenery; he was too 
new to the game. Through his 
binoculars he studied the quay at 
which he was to berth, the farthest 
upriver. Beyond it was a mess of 
dredging equipment, all part and 
parcel of the port expansion 
plan. Which side to would it be? He 
had still to make up his mind. 

“Sir,” said the Third Officer. 

“Yes?” 

“It doesn’t look as though the 
eddy is running, sir.” 

“What makes you think that, 
Mr. Viccini?” 

The young man pointed to the 
small craft — a yacht and two fish- 
ing vessels — past which they were 
sliding. Their upstream moor- 
ings were bar taut, their down- 
stream lines hanging in bights. 

“Mphm,” grunted Grimes. So it 
was ebb all over the river. He made 
up his mind. “Tell the Chief and 



Second Officers it will be star- 
board side to. Tell Mr. Wilcox to 
have his port anchor ready.” 

He came to starboard, lined the 
ship’s head up on the upriver end 
of the wharf. With his mouth whis- 
tle he blew one short, sharp blast. 
The chain cable of the port anchor 
rattled out through the pipe, the 
grip of the flukes in the mud acted 
as a brake. Sonya Winneck was 
still making way, but with the ebb 
against her and the drag of the 
anchor she was almost stopped. 

This, thought Grimes as he 
nosed in toward his berth, is easy. 

But there was an eddy after all; 
as soon the ship was well inside it 
she was swept upstream toward 
the dredges, buoys and pipelines. 

“Hard a-starboard,” Grimes 
ordered. 

The anchor was still holding, 
luckily, and it acted as a fulcrum, 
checking the upstream motion of 
the stem while the stern was free to 
swing. The vessel was broadside 
on to the line of the river now, still 
nearing the wharf, but head on. 

“Swing her, sir,” suggested Vic- 
cini. “Get a headline ashore and 
tell the linesmen to run it to the 
downriver end of the berth.” 

Yes, thought Grimes, it'll work. 
It better . 

A heaving line snaked ashore 
from the fo’c’s’le head and was 
caught by one of the waiting lines- 
men. He and another man ran with 
it to the post indicated by the 



SISTERSHIPS 



63 




Chief Officer. Then the whining 
self-t^sionjng winch took the^ 
weight. Belatedly Grimes thought 
that he had better stop the en- 
gines, had better go astern before 
the ship’s stem crashed through the 
wharf stringer. But the order had 
been anticipated. 

A good lad. Vice ini, he thought. 
But he'd better not make a habit 
of this sort of thing. 

Now Sonya Winneck’s bows 
were being pulled downriver 
against the counter current, her 
stem still only a few feet from the 
stringer, the stern swinging in 
easily. 

“Stop her,” Grimes ordered. 

She was alongside now with the 
very gentlest of impacts and the 
leading hand of the mooring gang 
was shouting up that she was in 
position. 

Grimes filled and lit his pipe. 
“Make fast fore and aft,” he said. 
“That’ll do the wheel. Finished 
with engines. Mr. Viccini, I appre- 
ciate your help. Don’t get me 
wrong, I like an officer to show 
initiative. But I think you should 
try to remember that there’s only 
one master on the bridge.” 

“But, sir — ” 

“That’s all right, Mr. Viccini. 
You did the right things and I 
appreciate it. I’ll try to do the 
right things myself in future.” 

Probably the Third Officer 
would have made a full explana- 
tion to Grimes during the day, but 

64 



as soon as the gangway was out 
the Winneck Line’s local agent 
came aboard with the mail and in it 
was a letter saying that Viccini 
was to be paid off to commence 
his annual leave and would be re- 
lieved that morning by a Mr. 
Denham. 

ONYA WINNECK continued 
her steady, round-the-planet 
progress, hardly straying north or 
south of the T ropics. The meteorol- 
ogy screen in the chartroom rarely 
showed indications of disturbed 
weather conditions — and when it 
did these were invariably hun- 
dreds of miles from the ship’s 
track. It was, Mr. Wilcox said to 
Grimes, the sort of weather you 
sign on for. The days and the nights 
passed pleasantly. At sea there 
was sunbathing, swimming in the 
ship’s pool that, when inflated, 
occupied all the foredeck between 
the forward and after cranes of the 
main hatch, deck golf and, in the 
evenings, a variety of games or a 
wide selection of programs on the 
playmasters installed throughout 
the accommodation. In port, the 
day’s business over, there was so 
much to see, so much to do. There 
was real swimming and surfing 
on sunwashed, golden beaches; 
now and again Grimes was able to 
hire a small sailing yacht for the 
day and found this sport much 
more enjoyable than on the lakes 
of Lorn, where wind was enough 



GALAXY 




but always bitter. There were the 
waterfront taverns — and both 
Grimes and Sonya loved seafood. 
The Terran lobster, prawn, oyster 
and herring had all done well in 
the Aquarian seas, and there were 
the local delicacies — the sand 
crawlers, which were something 
like Earth’s trilobites must have 
been; also butterfly fish and sea 
steaks. 

It was, for both of them, a 
holiday — but for Sonya it was a 
holiday that palled in time. It was 
all right for Grimes — he had his 
navigation to play with, his pilot- 
age and, when he got around to it, 
research to carry out on the pro- 
jected history and a chapter or so 
of it to write. His wife, however, 
was becoming bored. 

It was a longish run between 
Lynnhaven and Port Johnson, all 
of seven days. During it Sonya 
found stacks of magazines in one 
of the lockers in the ship’s office, 
old issues of the Merchant Ship- 
ping Journal, dating back for 
years. She brought a pile of them 
up to the day cabin. 

She said, “These could be useful 
to you, John.” 

Grimes picked one up, leafed 
through it. “All rather dry stuff. At 
the moment I’m trying to get the 
essential feel of this planet.” 

“But they’re full of informa- 
tion.” 

“So’s a dictionary.” 

She said, “Suppose 1 go through 



them, making notes of anything 
that might be useful to you.” 

“That,” he told her, “is very 
sweet of you, Sonya.” 

She made a grimace at him, then 
settled down with the supply of 
factual reading matter. Every- 
thing was there — specifications of 
new tonnage, sales, breakings up, 
wrecks, strandings, collisions, 
courts of inquiry. These latter 
were of interest to her. She could 
see how, time and time again, the 
unfortunate master in a few sec- 
onds had to decide what to do, 
while learned judges, counsel and 
marine assessors had weeks to de- 
cide what should have been done. 
And then, as she read on, nagging 
hints of some sort of pattern began 
to form in her trained mind. After 
all, she had been an intelligence 
officer — and a good one -in the 
Federation’s Survey Service. 

It seemed to her that the Win- 
neck Line ships were getting into 
more than their fair share of 
trouble, with Lone Star Line run- 
ning a close second. She knew 
little about the Lone Star Line, al- 
though she had seen their ships 
often enough in various ports and 
with Grimes had been a guest 
aboard a few of them for drinks 
and meals. They were excellently 
run and maintained vessels. She 
could speak with more authority 
regarding the Winneck Line; 
Sonya Winneck was typical of 
their newer tonnage. There wasn’t 



SISTERSHIPS 



65 




the same spit-and-polish as in the 
Lone Star, but there was a very 
real efficiency. 

She read again the details of one 
of the collision cases. Olga Win- 
neck had been bound up the Great 
Muddy River to Steelport, 
Suzanne Winneck had been out- 
bound. The ships had passed each 
other — or had attempted to pass 
each other — in Collier’s Reach, 
the navigable channel in that 
locality being both deep and wide. 
Suddenly Olga Winneck had 
taken a sheer to port and, in spite 
of the efforts of both masters to 
avert collision, had struck Suz- 
anne Winneck on her port quar- 
ter, holing her so badly that she 
had to return to dock for repairs. 

There was the transcript of evi- 
dence: 

Mr. Younghusband (Coun- 
sel for Havenmaster’s Office): 
Can you tell me, Mr. Margo- 
lies, what orders were given 
by Captain Hazzard? 

Mr. Margolies (Third Offi- 
cer of Olga Winneck)-. Yes, 
sir. The Master ordered 
“Hard a-starboard. Stop en- 
gines. Full astern.” 

Mr. Younghusband: And 
were these orders carried out? 

Mr. Margolies: Of course. 
I at once put the controls to 
full astern. 

Mr. Younghusband: And 
what about the wheel? Quar- 



termasters have been known 
to put the helm the wrong 
way, especially in an emer- 
gency. 

Mr. Margolies: The quar- 
termaster put the wheel hard 
to starboard. 

Mr. Younghusband: And 
did you look at the rudder in- 
dicator? It has been suggested 
that steering gear failure was 
a cause of the collision. 

Mr. Margolies: Yes, I 

looked. The pointer was hard 
over to starboard. 

And so it went on. It was es- 
tablished finally that both masters 
had done all the right things, al- 
though Captain Hazzard should 
have realized that a delay was in- 
evitable when switching directly 
from full ahead to full astern. It 
was thought that a tidal eddy had 
been responsible for the collision. 
The court recommended that ships 
passing in Collier’s Reach keep 
each well to their own sides of the 
channel, also that speed be reduced. 

That was one case. There were 
others, and Sonya made notes, 
drew up tables. There had been 
collisions in narrow channels and 
in the open sea. Some had been in 
clear weather, some under con- 
ditions of reduced visibility. The 
causes were various: tidal eddies, 
steering-gear failure, radar break- 
down and, inevitably, errors of 
judgment. The Winneck Line and 



66 



GALAXY 




the Lone Star Line were having 
more than their fair share of 
marine casualties. It was odd, she 
thought. Odd. Something was rot- 
ten on Aquarius. 

She asked Grimes if she could 
browse through the ship’s files of 
correspondence. 

He said, “Of course. They aren’t 
Top Secret.” 

She found one labeled Damage 
Reports. It wasn’t especially 
bulky. But its contents were inter- 
esting: 

Sir: 

I regret to have to report 
that while berthing this morn- 
ing at No. 3 Inner East, Port 
Kantor, the stem of the ves- 
sel came into heavy contact 
with the starboard side of the 
Lone Star Line’s Canopic. 
Damage to Sonya Winneck 
was superficial only — please 
see enclosed sketch — but that 
to the other ship was consid- 
erable and, 1 am informed by 
Canopic's Master, will neces- 
sitate dry-docking. 

I entered the Harbor at 
0545 hours, standing in on 
the main leads. When clear 
of the breakwaters I reduced 
speed to dead slow and al- 
tered course to port, steering 
for the shore end of No. 3 
Jetty. Visibility was good, 
wind was ENE at about 10 
knots, tidal influence, it be- 



ing just after low water slack, 
was negligible. 

When my bridge was just 
abeam of Canopic’s stern, 
however, Sonya Winneck 
took a sudden sheer to port. 
I at once ordered hard a-star- 
board, stopped the engines 
and ordered full astern. Also 
I signaled to the Chief Offi- 
cer to let go the starboard an- 
chor, but unfortunately it 
jammed in the pipe, and was 
released too late to have any 
effect. In spite of the applica- 
tion of full starboard rudder 
and full stern power, contact 
occurred at 0555 hours. 

It is possible that I under- 
estimated the force of the 
wind while standing in to my 
berth, but even so I find it 
hard to account for the sud- 
den sheer to port . 

But Sonya Winneck was some- 
times at the receiving end: 

Sir: 

I have to report that this 
afternoon, at 1327 hours, the 
vessel was struck by the 
Company’s Elizabeth Win- 
neck, which same was pro- 
ceeding downriver, bound for 
sea. Unfortunately, it being 
Saturday afternoon, with no 
work in progress, no officers 
were on deck at the time of 
the contact and the Com- 



SISTER SHIPS 



67 




pany’s gangway watchman 
was at his place of duty, at 
the head of the gangway on 
the inshore side of the ves- 
sel. 

Damage, fortunately, was 
not extensive and all above 
the waterline. My Chief Offi- 
cer's report is enclosed here- 
with. No doubt you will be 
hearing from Captain Pardoe 
of Elizabeth Winneck . 



rilHERE were several more let- 
^ ters, some going into great de- 
tail, others composed on the 
good old principle of “least said, 
soonest mended.” With two excep- 
tions, the other ships concerned 
were units of either the Winneck 
or the Lone Star fleets. One of 
the exceptions was the contact 
with Iron Duchess. On that occa- 
sion Captain Harrell, Grimes’ 
predecessor, had been trying to 
berth his ship during a howling 
gale. The other occasion was a 
collision with a ferry steamer in 
Carrington Harbor, with fortu- 
nately no loss of life. 

So, Sonya wondered, just what 
was the connection between the 
Winneck Line and the Lone Star 
Line? She borrowed from the 
Chief Officer's office the bulky 
Aquarian Registry in which were 
listed comprehensive details of 
all the commercial shipping of 
the planet. Against the name of 
each ship were the lines of informa- 
68 



tion — tonnage, gross, net and 
deadweight; propulsion; speed; 
length overall, length between 
posts, breadth and builders. 

She looked up her namesake 
first. The Sonya Winneck had 
been built by the Carrington 
State Dockyard. She looked up 
Canopic. The builders were Var- 
ley's Dockyard in Steelport. She 
looked up Elizabeth Win- 
neck — another Varley’s job. So it 
went on. The majority of the col- 
lisions had occurred between 
ships constructed at those two 
yards. 

And what about the contact that 
her husband had so narrowly 
averted that time coming into 
Newhaven? What was the name of 
the ship that he had almost but not 
quite hit? Orionic . She looked it 
up. Carrington State Dockyard. 

She murmured, “All us Carring- 
ton girls must stick together.” 

"What was that?” demanded 
Grimes, looking up from his book. 

“Just a thought,” she told him. 
“Just a passing thought.” 

“Mphm.” 

“Do ships really have person- 
alities?” she asked. 

He grinned. “Spacemen and sea- 
men like to kid themsleves that 
they do. Look at it this way. 
You’re bringing a ship in — a 
spaceship or a surface ship — and 
you’ve failed to allow for all the 
factors affecting her handling. 
Your landing or berthing isn’t up 
to your usual standard. But you 
GALAXY 




kid yourself and your officers 
that it wasn’t your fault. You say, 
‘She was a proper little hellcat, 
wasn’t she? Wouldn’t do a thing 
right — ’ But you were the one who 
wasn’t doing the thing right.” 

She said, “I’ve handled ships, 
too.” 

“I know, my dear. I’ve seen you 
do it. Your landing technique is a 
little too flashy for my taste.” 
“Never mind that now. I’m talk- 
ing about surface ships. Is there 
any reason to believe, John, that 
two ships built to the same design, 
but in different yards, would have 
conflicting personalities?” 

Grimes became annoyed with his 
wife. “Damn it all,” he expostu- 
lated, “spacemen’s superstitions 
are bad enough. I’m surprised that 
you, of all people, should pay any 
heed to them — and more that you 
should invent new superstitions 
of your own.” 

“But are they superstitions? 
Couldn’t a machine absorb, some- 
how, something of the personal- 
ities of the people who built it, the 
people who handle it?” 

“Hogwash,” said Grimes. 

“If that’s the way you feel about 
it — ” She slumped deep in her 
chair, looked at her husband. “All 
right. Before you get back to your 
precious research, what do the ini- 
tials PN mean?” 

“In what context?” 

Sonya nudged with a slim, 
sandaled foot the bulky Aquarian 



Registry that lay open on the deck 
in front of her. “It’s printed against 
the names of some of the ships, the 
newer ships — but only those built 
by the Carrington State Dock- 
yard or Varley’s.” 

“P — N?’’ muttered Grimes. 
“We can ask the Mate, I sup- 
pose.” 

“But you don’t like to,” she 
scoffed. “Captain, you know 
everything.” 

“Almost everything,” he quali- 
fied smugly. The ship lurched sud- 
denly — and Grimes knew the rea- 
son. When last he had been on the 
bridge, he had been slightly per- 
turbed by the chart presented on 
the meteorology screen, televised 
from one of the weather satellites. 
Ahead of Sonya Winneck was a 
deepening depression, almost sta- 
tionary. He had considered alter- 
ing course to try to avoid it — but, 
after all, he had a big, powerful 
ship under his feet, well found, 
stoutly constructed. And, he had 
thought, he would not like to be 
remembered on this world as a 
fair-weather sailorman. Even so, 
he saw in his mind’s eye that 
chart — the crowded isobars, the 
wind arrows with their clockwise 
circulation. Now the heavy swell 
running outward from the center, 
like ripples from a pebble dropped 
into a pond, was beginning to 
make itself felt. He looked at the 
aneroid barometer on the bulk- 
head. The needle had fallen ten 



SISTERSHIPS 



69 




millibars since he had last set the 
pointer two hours ago. 

He said, “I fear we’re in for a 
dirty night.” 

She said, “It’s what you’re paid 
for.” 

He grunted, rose from his chair, 
went to the bridge by the inside 
companionway. In the chart- 
room he paused at the instruments 
over the chart table. According to 
the Chernikeeff Log, speed 
through the water had already 
dropped by half a knot. The baro- 
graph showed a fairly steep fall in 
pressure. The screen, set for the 
area through which the ship was 
passing, showed a chart almost 
identical with the one he had last 
seen. 

He continued out to the bridge. 
The sky was mainly overcast now, 
with the larger of the two 
Aquarian moons — almost full - 
showing fitfully through ragged 
breaks in the clouds. There was 
high altitude wind, although it had 
yet to be felt at .sea level. But the 
swell seemed to be increasing. 

Young Mr. Denham, the Third 
Officer, came across from the 
wing of the bridge. He said rather 
too cheerfully, “Looks like a 
blow, sir.” 

“We can’t expect fine weather 
all the time,” Grimes told him. He 
stood with his legs well apart, 
braced against the motion of the 
ship. He wondered if he would be 
seasick, then consoled himself 



with the thought that both the ac- 
tual Lord Nelson and the fic- 
tional Lord Hornblower had been 
afflicted by this malady. 

Mr. Denham— since Grimes had 
torn that strip off him regarding 
the unauthorized engine move- 
ments, he had tended to overcom- 
pensate — went on chirpily, “At 
this time of the year, sir, the revolv- 
ing storms in these waters are un- 
predictable. In theory the center 
should be traveling east away 
from us, but in practice it’s likely 
to do anything.” 

“Oh?” 

“Yes, sir. I remember one when 
I was in the old Sally — Sara Win- 
neck, that is. Captain Tregenza 
tried to outmaneuver it — we had a 
pile of deck cargo that trip, teak 
logs from Port Mandalay. But it 
was almost as though the storm 
had a brain of its own. Finally it 
sat right on top of us and matched 
speed and course, no matter which 
way we steered. We lost all the car- 
go off the foredeck and the wheel- 
house windows were smashed 
in — ” 

Cheerful little swine . 

Grimes stared ahead into the 
intermittenly moonlit night at the 
long swell that was coming in at 
an angle to the ship’s course. 
Sonya Winneck’s bows lifted, 
dipped, plunging into and through 
the moving dune of water. They 
lifted again and a white cascade 
poured aft from the break of the

GALAXY 




fo’c’s’le, spangled with jewels of 
luminescence. 

Grimes said, “Anyhow, we have 
no deck cargo this trip.” 

“No, sir.” 

He remained on the bridge a 
while longer. There was nothing 
that he could do and he knew it. 
The ship was far from unsea- 
worthy; she was capable of riding 
out a hurricane. There was ample 
sea room; the Low Grenadines 
were many miles to the north of her 
track. And yet he felt uneasy, 
could not shake off a nagging pre- 
monition. Something, he some- 
how knew, was cooking. But what? 

At last he said, “You know 
where to find me if you want me. 
Good night, Mr. Denham.” 

“Good night, sir.” 

Ill 

B ack in his quarters his uneasi- 
ness persisted. He told Sonya 
that he would sleep on the settee in 
his day cabin in order to be more 
readily available in the event of 
any emergency. She did not argue 
with him; she, too, felt a growing 
tension in the air. It could have 
been that she was sensitive to his 
moods but, she told him, she didn’t 
think so. 

She quoted: '"By the pricking of 
my thumbs /Something wicked this 
way comes ...” 

He laughed. “A tropical revolv- 
ing storm is not wicked, my dear. 



Like any other manifestation of 
the forces of nature, it is neither 
good nor evil.” 

She repeated, "Something 
wicked this way comes ...” 

They said good night then and 
she retired to the bedroom while 
he disposed himself comfort- 
ably on the settee. He was rather 
surprised that sleep was not long 
in coming. 

But he did not enjoy his slum- 
ber for more than a couple of 
hours. A particularly violent lurch 
awakened him — almost pitched 
him off his couch. He switched on a 
light and looked at the aneroid 
barometer. The needle was down 
another twenty millibars. And in 
spite of the well insulated plating 
of the accommodation, he could 
hear the wind; he both heard and 
felt the crash of heavy water on 
deck. He thrust his feet into san- 
dals and, clad only in his 
shorts — Captain’s privilege — ran 

up to the bridge. He found the Sec- 
ond Officer — it was now the mid- 
dle watch — in the wheelhouse, 
looking ahead through the big 
clear view screen. Grimes joined 
him. When his eyes became ac- 
customed to the semidarkness he 
could see that the wind was broad 
on the starboard bow — he could 
see, too, that with each gust it was 
veering, working gradually 
around from southeast to south. 

Southern Hemisphere, he 
thought. Clockwise circulation

and the low barometer on my left 
hand . 

Now that he had something to 
work on, he might as well avoid the 
center with its confused, heavy 
seas. 

“Bring her round to starboard 
easily,” he ordered. “Bring wind 
and sea ahead.” 

“Wind and sea ahead, sir.” The 
officer went to the controls of the 
autopilot. Grimes watched the 
bows swinging slowly. 

He said, “That should do, Mr. 
Andersen.” 

“Course one three five now, sir.” 

Grimes went back into the chart- 
room, glanced at the chart and 
busied himself briefly with paral- 
lel rulers and dividers. He 
grunted his satisfaction. This new 
course took him even clearer of the 
Low Grenadines, that chain of 
rocky islets that were little more 
than reefs. There was nothing to 
worry about. 

He was aware that Sonya was 
standing behind him — he caught 
a hint of her perfume, an aware- 
ness of her proximity. 

He said without turning around, 
“Passengers not allowed on the 
bridge.” 

She asked, “Where are we?” 

He indicated with the points of 
the dividers the penciled cross of 
the position, the new course line 
extending from it. “I’m more or 
less, but not quite, heaving to. But 
she’s easier on this heading and it 



pulls her away from the eye of. the 
storm.” 

She said, “There’s a lot to be 
said for spaceships. They don’t 
pitch and roll. When you’re in your 
virtuous couch you’re not slung 
out of it.” 

“We take what comes,” he told 
her. 

“We haven’t much option, have 
we?” 

They went below again, and she 
made coffee; they talked for a 
while, and eventually Grimes 
settled down to another install- 
ment of his broken night’s sleep. 

WHE next time he awoke it was 
^ to the insistent buzzing of the 
bridge telephone in his bedroom. 
He rolled off the settee and stum- 
bled through the curtained door- 
way. Sonya, looking rather hos- 
tile, lifted the instrument off its 
rest and handed it to him. 

“Captain here,” said Grimes 
into the mouthpiece. 

“Second Officer, sir. There’s a 
Mayday — ” 

“I’ll be right up.” 

The officer in the chartroom 
straightened as Grimes came in. 
“It’s Iron Warrior, sir. One of 
their big bulk carriers. She’s 
broken down, lying in the trough. 
Her cargo’s shifted. Zinc concen- 
trates.” 

“Not good. Where is she?” 

The young man stood away from 
the chart so that Grimes could see. 



72 



GALAXY 




indicating the other ship’s posi- 
tion with the point of a pencil. 
“Here, sir. Just twenty miles south 
of the Low Grenadines. She 
reports a southerly gale, the same 
as we’re getting.’’ 

“Not good,’’ said Grimes again. 
“Not good at all. She’ll be making 
leeway, drifting — ’’ Swiftly he 
measured the distance between 
Sonya Winneck's last recorded 
position — electronic navigation 
had its good points — and that given 
by the disabled ship. One hundred 
and fifty nautical miles. Sonya 
Winneck would have to turn, put- 
ting the wind right aft. With her 
high superstructure, this should 
mean a marked increase of speed. 
Suppose she made twenty knots 
over the ground. Twenty into one 
hundred and fifty gave seven and a 
half hours. He looked at the chart- 
room clock. Three-thirty. 

“Put your stand-by man on the 
wheel, Mr. Andersen,’’ he 
ordered. “I’m bringing her around 
manually.’’ 

He went out into the wheel- 
house. Both moons were down but 
the sky had cleared. The scattered 
stars overhead were bright; and 
bright, too, were the living stars 
thrown aloft and back in the sheets 
of spray each time that the ship’s 
prow crashed down to meet the 
racing seas. Grimes stood wait- 
ing, hoping for a lull, however 
brief. He glanced behind him and 
saw that the wheel was manned and 



that Andersen was standing be- 
side the helmsman. 

He looked ahead again. It 
seemed to him that the pitching of 
the ship was a little less pro- 
nounced, that sea and swell were a 
little less steep. 

“Port,” he ordered. “Easily, 
easily — ” 

He heard the clicking of the 
gyrorepeater as the ship’s head 
started to come around. And then 
he saw it, broad on the starboard 
bow, a towering cliff of water, 
white-capped, a freak sea.. 

“Hard aport!” Grimes shouted. 

She responded beautifully and 
the clicking of the repeater was 
almost one continuous note. She 
responded beautifully — but not 
quite fast enough. The crest of the 
dreadful sea was overhanging the 
bridge now, poised to fall and 
smash. Still she turned, and then 
she heeled far over to port, fling- 
ing Grimes and the Second Offi- 
cer and the helmsman into an un- 
tidy huddle on that side of the 
wheelhouse. She shuddered as the 
tons of angry water crashed down 
onto her poop and surged forward 
along her decks, even onto the 
bridge itself. There was a banging 
and clattering of loose gear; cries 
and screams came from below. 
But miraculously she steadied and 
righted herself, surging forward 
with only a not very violent pitch- 
ing motion. 

Somehow Grimes made it to his 

73 



SISTERSHIPS 




feet, disentangling himself from 
the other two men. He staggered 
to the untended wheel and grasped 
the spokes. He looked at the re- 
peater card. Three two oh — care- 
fully he applied starboard rudder 
and brought the lubber’s line to 
the course that had been laid off on 
the chart, three three five. He saw 
that Andersen and the seaman 
had recovered their footing and 
were standing by awaiting fur- 
ther orders. 

“Put her back on automatic,” he 
told the Second Officer. “On this 
course.” He relinquished the 
wheel as soon as this had been 
done. “Then take your watch with 
you and make rounds through the' 
accommodation. Let me know if 
anybody’s been hurt.” 

“Who the hell’s rocking the 
bloody boat?” It was Wilcox, the 
Chief Officer. He saw Grimes by 
the binnacle. “Sorry, sir.” 

“It’s an emergency, Mr. Wil- 
cox. A Mayday call. Iron War- 
rior, broken down and drifting on 
to the Low Grenadines. We’re 
going to her assistance.” 

“What time do you estimate 
that we shall reach her. Captain?” 
“About eleven hundred hours.” 
“I’d better start getting things 
ready.” 

Grimes went back into the chart- 
room, to the transceiver that had 
been switched on as soon as the 
auto-alarm had been actuated by 
the Mayday call. 



‘"Sonya W inneck to Ocean Con- 
trol, Area Five,” he said. 

“Ocean Control to Sonya Win- 
neck. I receive you. Pass your 
message.” 

“I am now proceeding to the as- 
sistance of Iron Warrior. Esti- 
mated time of visual contact ten- 
thirty hours. Zone Plus Seven.” 

“Thank you, Sonya Winneck. 
Pleiaidic cannot be in the vicinity 
until thirteen hundred hours at 
the earliest. Please use Channel 
Six when working Iron Warrior. 
Call me on Sixteen to keep me in- 
formed. Over.” 

He switched to Channel Six. 
“Sonya Winneck to Iron War- 
rior." 

"Iron Warrior here, Sonya Win- 
neck.” The other Captain’s voice 
was, perhaps, a little too calm. 

“How are things with you. Iron 
Warrior^" 

“Bloody awful, to be frank. A 
twenty-degree list and my boats 
and rafts smashed on the weather 
side. Estimated rate of drift, two 
knots.” 

“I should be with you in seven 
hours,” said Grimes. “I shall try to 
take you in tow.” 

“We’ll be ready. Captain.” 

“Good. We shall be seeing you 
shortly. Over and standing by.” 

Wilcox had come into the chart- 
room. He said, “Everybody’s been 
informed, sir. Engineroom reck- 
ons they can squeeze out another 
half knot.” 



74 



GALAXY 




“Anybody hurt .when she went 
over?” 

“Only minor lacerations and 
contusions, sir." 

“Such as this,” announced 
Sonya, who had joined the others 
in the chartroom, putting a cau- 
tious hand up to the beginnings of 
a black eye. “But it’s in a good 
cause.” 

¥/?(97V WARRIOR was not a 
^pretty sight. 

She lay wallowing in a welter of 
white water, like a dying sea beast. 
The seas broke over her rust-col- 
ored hull in great explosions of 
spray, but now and again, during 
brief lulls, the extent of the dam- 
age that she had sustained could 
be made out. She was a typical 
bulk carrier, with all the accom- 
modation aft, only a stumpy mast 
right forward and her mainmast 
growing out of her funnel — and 
no cargo gear save one crane on 
the poop for ship’s stores and the 
like. The crane. Grimes could see 
through his binoculars, was a 
twisted tangle of wreckage. That 
would explain why the Warrior’s 
Captain had not used oil to mini- 
mize the effect of breaking waves; 
probably the entrance to the 
storerooms was blocked. And 
there must be some other reason 
why it had not been possible to 
pump diesel fuel overside — even 
though a mineral oil was not as 
effective as vegetable or animal 



oil, it was better than nothing. The 
side of the bridge seemed to be 
stove in and under the boat davits 
dangled a mess of fiberglass 
splinters. 

Beyond her — and not far be- 
yond her, a mere three miles — was 
the black, jagged spine of Dev- 
lin’s Islet, dead to leeward. It 
seemed more alive, somehow, 
than the stricken ship; it looked 
like a great, malevolent sea 
monster creeping nearer and ever 
nearer through the boiling surf to- 
ward its dying prey. 

Grimes was using oil — a thin 
trickle of it from his scuppers with 
wads of waste soaked in it thrown 
overside to leeward. Luckily 
there had been plenty of it in Sonya 
Winneck’s storerooms — fish oil 
for the preservation of exposed 
wire ropes, a heavy vegetable oil 
for the treatment of wooden decks 
and brightwork. It was beginning 
to have an effect; the thin, glisten- 
ing surface film was a skin over 
the water between the two ships, 
an integument that contained the 
sea, forcing some semblance of 
form upon it. The swell was still 
there — heavy, too heavy — but the 
waves were no longer breaking, 
their violence suppressed. 

Andersen and his men were 
standing by the aft rocket gun. 
The heavy insurance wire was al- 
ready flaked out ready for run- 
ning, its inboard end taken not only 
around both pairs of bitts — these,

in a ship with self-tensioning 
winches, were rarely used for 
mooring, but there was always 
the possibility of a tow — but also 
around the poop house. The sisal 
messenger was coiled down handy 
to the line-throwing apparatus. 

On the bridge. Grimes conned 
his ship. She was creeping along 
parallel to Iron Warrior now, at 
reduced speed. She was making 
too much leeway for Grimes’ 
taste; unless he was careful there 
would be two wrecks instead of 
one. Too, with the swell broad on 
the beam, Sonya Winneck was 
rolling heavily, so much so that 
accurate shooting would be 
impossible. But the necessary 
maneuvers had been worked out in 
advance. At the right moment 
Grimes would come hard to port, 
presenting his stern to the Iron 
Warrior. Andersen would loose 
off his rocket, aiming for a point 
just abaft the break of the other 
ship’s fo’c’s’le head, where men 
were already standing by. They 
would grab the light nylon rocket 
line and use it to puli aboard the 
heavier messenger, using that to 
drag the end of the towing wire 
aboard and shackle it to the port 
anchor cable. After that, it would 
be clear sailing. Grimes hoped. He 
would come ahead slowly, take the 
weight gently, try to avoid the 
imposition of overmuch strain on 
either vessel. Slowly but surely he 
would pull the wounded Warrior 



away from the hostile fortifica- 
tions. 

Come off it, Grimes, he told 

himself sternly. Don’t be so 

bloody literary. 

“Hard aport,” he ordered. 

“Hard aport, sir.” The clicking 
of the repeater was audible above 
the shrieking of the wind. 

“Ease her. Midships. Steady. 

Steady as you go.” 

Sonya Winneck hung there, her 
stern a bare two cables from the 
side of Iron Warrior. He had cut 
that rather too close. But at this 
range it would be impossible for 
Andersen to miss. 

To the Third Officer, at the 

radar, he called, “Are we opening 
the range?” 

“Slowly, sir.” 

It was time that Andersen. got 
his roeket away. The ship was not 
pitching too badly; firing at just 
the right moment should not be 
difficult. As long as the missile 
passed over the target it would be 
a successful shot. Grimes went 
out to the wing of the bridge to 
watch. The air-scoop dodger de- 
flected the wind, throwing it up 
and over, so it was not too uncom- 
fortable away from the wheel- 
house. 

Andersen fired — and at pre- 
cisely the wrong moment the ship’s 
head fell off heavily to starboard. 
The rocket streaked through the 
air, arching high, a brief orange 
flare against the gray, ragged

clouds, a streamer of white smoke 
and behind it the fluorescent 
yellow filament of the nylon line. 
Inevitably it missed, splashing to 
the sea well forward of and be- 
yond Iron Warrior's bows. 

Grimes didn’t see it drop. He 
stormed into the wheelhouse, 
bawled at the helmsman, “What 
the hell do you think you’re play- 
ing at?” 

“It’s the wheel, sir.” The man’s 
voice was frightened. “It turned in 
my hands. I can’t budge it!” 

The ship was coming around 
still, turning all the time to star- 
board. The gale-force wind and her 
own engines were driving her 
down on to the helpless Warrior. 

“Stop her!” ordered Grimes. 
“Full astern!” 

Denham was still at the radar, so 
Wilcox jumped to the engine con- 
trols. He slammed the lever hard 
over to the after position. Still the 
ship was making headway — but, 
at last slowing. She stopped at 
last, her stem scant feet from Iron 
Warrior’s exposed side. Grimes 
could see the white faces of her 
people as they stared at him — as 
they watched, in horrified dis- 
belief, this rescuer turned assassin. 

Sonya Winneck was backing 
away now, her stern coming up 
into the wind. She was backing 
away, but reluctantly. 

Wilcox shouted, “Denham, come 
and give me a hand! 1 can’t keep 
this bloody handle down!” 



Grimes dragged his attention 
away from the ship he had so 
nearly rammed to what was hap- 
pening on his own bridge. Both the 
Chief and Third Officers — and 
Wilcox was a big, strong man — 
were having to exert all their 
strength to keep the metal lever in 
its astern position. It was jerking, 
forcing itself up against their hands. 

S ONYA — who until now had 
been keeping well out of the 
way — grabbed him by the arm. 
“Tell the Chief to put the engine 
controls on manual!” she 
screamed. “I know what’s happen- 
ing!” 

“What’s happening?” 

“No time now to tell you. Just 
put her on manual — and get Lecky 
up here!” 

Grimes went to the telephone, 
rang down to the engineroom. 
“Manual control, your end, Mr. 
Jones,” he ordered. “Keep her on 
full astern until I order otherwise. 
And send Miss Hales up to the 
bridge. At once.” 

Thankfully Wilcox and Den- 
ham released their painful grip on 
the bridge-control lever. The revo- 
lution indicator on the console 
still showed maximum stern pow- 
er. Yet the distance between the 
two ships was fast diminishing. 

From the VHF transceiver came 
a frightened voice, “What’s hap- 
pening, Sonya Winneck? What’s 
happening?” 



SISTER SHIPS

“Tell him,” said Grimes to 
Denham, “that weTe having 
trouble with our bridge controls. 
We’ll get a line aboard as soon as 
we can.” 

Wilcox, watching the indicator, 
yelled, “She’s stopped! The hellcat 
is coming ahead again!” 

Sonya said urgently, “There’s 
only one thing to do, John. Shut off 
the Purcell Navigator. Iron War- 
rior has P.N. against her name in 
the Registry — and she was built by 
Varley’s.” She turned to Mary 
Hales, who had just come on to the 
bridge. “Mary, switch off that 
bloody tin brain. Pull fuses or 
something — but kill it!” 

The pretty little blonde was no 
longer so pretty. On one side of her 
head the hair was charred and 
frizzled and her smooth face was 
marred by an angry burn. 

“We’ve been trying to,” she 
gasped. “The Chief and I. It won’t 
let us.” 

“She’s coming astern again,” 
announced Wilcox. “She’s — no, 
she’s stopped.” 

“Watch her, Mr. Wilcox,” 
ordered Grimes. He ran with his 
wife and the Electrician to the 
house abaft the chartroom in 
which the Purcell Navigator lived. 
It squatted there sullenly on its 
four stumpy legs, the dials set 
around its spherical body glaring 
at them like eyes. From its under- 
side ran armored cables, some 
thick and some thin; the one 



leading aft and down must be the 
main power supply; the ones 
leading into the wheelhouse and 
chartroom would be connected to 
various controls and navigational 
equipment. On the after bulkhead 
of the house were a switchboard 
and fuse box. Mary Hales went 
straight to this and put out her 
hand to the main switch. There was 
a sudden, intense violet flare, a 
sharp crackling, the tang of over- 
heated metal. The girl staggered 
back, her blistered hands covering 
her eyes. 

“That’s what happened to the 
engineroom switchboard!” Mary 
wailed. “It’s welded itself in the On 
position!” 

Then, using language more 
seamanlike than ladylike, she 
threw herself at the fuse box. She 
was too late — but perhaps this was 
as well. Had she gotten the lid open 
she would have been blinded. 

Still cursing softly, she grabbed 
a spanner from her belt. Her 
intention was obvious; she would 
unscrew the retaining nut that held 
the main supply lead firmly in its 
socket. But an invisible force 
yanked the tool out of her hand and 
threw it out of the room. 

Grimes watched, helpless. Then 
he heard Sonya snarling, “Do 
something. Do something, damn 
you!” 

She thrust an object into his 
right hand. He looked down at it. It 
was the big fire axe from its rack in 



78 



GALAXY 




the chartroom. He got both hands 
about the haft and tried to swing up 
the head of the weapon, staggering 
as the magnetic fields which now 
were the machine's main defense 
tugged at it. But he lifted the axe 
somehow and brought it crashing 
down — to miss his own right foot 
by a millimeter. Again he raised 
the axe, straining with all his 
strength, and again struck at the 
th ick cable. The ship lurched 
heavily, deflecting his aim- and, 
fantastically, the magnetic 
deflection brought the head back 
to its target. The armored cable 
writhed away from the blow, but 
not in time. The keen edge bit 
home in a coruscation of violet 
sparks. And Mary Hales, with a 
smaller axe that she had found 
somewhere, was chopping away, 
sobbing and cursing, and Sonya 
was yabbing with a heavy screw- 
driver at the thing’s “eyes.” And 
so, at last, it died. 

A nd so it died, damaged be- 
yond its built-in powers of self- 
regeneration. Mary Hales made 
sure of that. Grimes was finally 
able to get a line aboard Iron 
Warrior and the Warrior's people 
got the towing wire shackled to 
their anchor cable. Slowly but 
surely the crippled ship was 
dragged to safety, away from the 
avidly waiting fangs and talons of 
Devlin’s Islet, the rocky teeth and 
claws that, when the tow finally 



commenced, had been less than a 
half-mile distant. 

The Purcell Navigator was dead 
and its last flares of energy had 
destroyed or damaged much more 
than itself. The gyrocompass and 
the autopilot were inoperative — 
but the ship had a magnetic com- 
pass and hand steering. Loran and 
radar were burned out; inertial 
navigator and echometer were be- 
yond repair; even the Chernikeeff 
Log was useless. But Grimes was 
not worried. He had sextant, 
chronometer, ephemeris and tables 

and the great navigators ef 
Earth’s past had circled their globe 
with much less in the way of equip- 
ment. In the extremely unlikely 
event of his not knowing where he 
was, he could always ask Iron War- 
rior for a fix — but he did not think 
that he would have to do so. 

He did, however, urge the 
Warrior to put her own Purcell 
Navigator out of commission, ex- 
plaining why in some detail. Then 
he went to the house abaft the 
chartroom where, under the 
direction of Mary Hales, Wilcox 
and his men were loosening the 
holding-down bolts and discon- 
necting the cables that had not al- 
ready been cut. There might still be 
a flicker of life in the thing, some 
capability of self-repair. He 
watched happily as three brawny 
ratings lifted the spherical casing 
from the deck and staggered with it 
out of the door.

“What shall we do with it, sir?” 
“Give it a buoyancy test,” 
ordered Grimes. He followed the 
men to the side rail of the bridge 
and watched as they tipped it over. 
It sank without a trace. 

G RI M ES was relieved of his com- 
mand in Longhaven, after 
the successful completion of the 
tow, and flown back to Steep Is- 
land, accompanied by Sonya. 
Neither he nor his wife felt very 
strong when they boarded the air- 
ship — the crews of both Sonya 
Winneck and Iron Warrior had 
united in laying on a farewell 
party more enthusiastic than 
restrained. Even so, old and tired 
as he was feeling. Grimes had 
insisted on seeing the airship’s 
Captain in order to be assured that 
the craft was not fitted with a 
Purcell Navigator. Then he and his 
wife went to their cabin and col- 
lapsed into their bunks. 

Steep Island, although not 
officially an airport, had a 
mooring mast, so a direct flight 
was possible. When the time came 
for Grimes and Sonya to disem- 
bark they were feeling better and, 
in fact, had been able to put the 
finishing touches to their report. 

Captain Thornton, the haven- 
master, welcomed them warmly, 
but was obviously anxious to hear 
what they had to tell him. In 
only minutes they were all seated in 
the Lookout and Thornton was 



listening intently as they talked. 

When they were finished he 
smiled grimly. “This is good 
enough,” he said. “1 shall issue 
orders that those infernal 
machines are to be rendered 
inoperative in every ship fitted with 
them and that no more are to be 
put aboard any Aquarian vessel. 
Then we make arrangements to 
ship them all back to where they 
came from.” 

Grimes was surprised and said 
so. 

Thornton laughed. “What 
you’ve said is what I’ve been 
saying, John, for months. But no- 
body listens to me. I’m just a 
reactionary old shellback. But 
you, sir, as well as being a well- 
known maritime historian, have 
also one foot at least in what to us 
is still the future. You’re a Mas- 
ter Astronaut; you hold the rank of 
Commodore in the Space Navy of 
your Confederacy. They’ll listen to 
you when they won’t listen to me.” 

“It’s Sonya they should listen 
to,” Grimes said. “She’s a space- 
woman and an intelligence officer. 
She tied the loose ends together.” 

“But it was all so obvious,” she 
said smugly. “Two yards — and two 
yards only — on this planet were 
licensed to install the Purcell 
Navigator — Varley’s and the Car- 
rington State Dockyard. Two — 
sororities? Yes, two sororities of 
ships, the Varley Sisterhood and 
the Carrington Sisterhood, each

hating the other. Limited intelli- 
gence — but somehow a strong, 
built-in spite and also a strong 
sense of self-preservation. That 
much, 1 think, was intended by 
those electronic geniuses on Elek- 
tra- and possibly more, but I'll 
come to that later. 

“Anyhow, if a Carrington sister 
saw a chance of taking a swipe at a 
Varley sister without much risk of 
damage to herself — she’d take it. 
And vice versa. Hence all the 
collisions and all the minor 
berthing accidents. Now and 
again, of course, the sense of self- 
preservation worked to every- 
body’s benefit." She smiled at her 
husband rather too sweetly. “I 
know of at least one bungled berth- 
ing where everything mirac- 
ulously, came right in the end.” 
“But what’s behind it all?” asked 
Thornton. “You’re the Intelli- 
gence Officer. Is it, do you think, 
intentional on somebody’s part?” 

“I don’t know, Tom. I’d have to 
snoop around on Elektra to find 
out — and 1 doubt if the Elektrans 
would let me. But try this idea on 
for size: what if the Elektrans 
want to make Aquarius absolutely 
dependent upon them?” 

“It could be,” mused Thornton. 
“It could be.” He stood up, walked 
to the bookshelves, took out a book 
and opened it. It was Grimes’ own 
Times of Transition. Thornton 
leafed through it to find the right 
place. He read aloud. “ 'And so

F rank MERWIN refolded the 
letter, replaced it in its envelope 
and laid it on the flange of the lamp 
stand, near the radio. He held his 
wife a little more tightly. Her 
sobbing had become less than hys- 
terical, now that the terrible ini- 
tial shock had somewhat worn. He 
managed to keep his own emo- 
tions pretty well in check, but then 
he had driven the Los Angeles 
area for some twenty years and 
was correspondingly tough- 
ened. When he finally spoke 
again there was as much bitter- 
ness in his voice as sorrow. 

“Geez, Myrt, oh, geez.” 

He eased her down onto the big 
white couch, walked to the center 
of the room and paused there, 
hands clenching and unclench- 
ing, clasped behind his back. The 
woven patterns in the floor ab- 
sorbed his attention. 

“Goddamn it. Myrtle, I told 
him! I told him! ‘Look, son, if you 
insist on driving all the way to Di- 
ego by yourself, at least take the 
Pontiac! Have some sense,’ I told 
him! 1 don’t know what’s with the 
kids these days, hon. You’d think 
he’d listen to me just this once, 
wouldn’t you? Me, who once drove 
all the way from Indianapolis to 
L.A. and was challanged only 
twice on the way — only twice, 
Myrt, but no, he hadda be a big 
shot! ‘Listen Dad. This is some- 
thing I’ve got to work out for my- 
self. With my own car,’ he tells me! 
I knew he’d have trouble in that 



VW. And I often told him so, too. 

“But no, all he could think of to 
say was, ‘Pops, the worst that can 
happen is I’ve gotta outman- 
euver some other can, right? 
You’ve seen the way that bug corn- 
ers, haven’t you, huh? And if I get 
into a tough scrape, any other 
VW on the road is bound by oath 
to support me — in most actions 
anyway.’ 

“Whatta you tell a kid like that, 
Myrt? How do you get through to 
him?” His face registered utter 
bafflement. His wife’s crying had 
slowed to a trickle. She was dab- 
bing at her eyes with one of his old 
handkerchiefs. 

“I don’t know either, dear. I 
still don’t understand why he had 
to drive down there. Why couldn’t 
he have taken the Trans, Frank? 
Why?” 

“Oh, you know why. What 
would his friends have said? ‘Here’s 
Bobby Merwin, too scared to 
drive his own rod,’ and that sort of 
crud.” His sarcasm was getting 
edgier. “Still felt he had to prove 
himself a man, the idiot! He’d al- 
ready soloed on the free- 
ways — why did he feel the need to 
try a cross-county expedition? 
But damn it, if he had to display 
his guts, why couldn’t he have done 
so in the big car? Not even a pro- 
fessionally customized VW can 
mount much stuff. 

“And on top of everything else, 
you’d think he’d have had the sense 
to shy off that kind of an argu- 



WHY JOHNNY CAN'T SPEED 



83 




merit? He had Driver’s Training! 
Who ever heard of a VW disput- 
ing position with a Cad — a Mar- 
auder, no less! Where were his 
‘friends,’ huh? I warned him about 
the light stretches between here 
and Diego, where flow is light, 
help is more than a hornblast 
away and some psycho can sur- 
prise you from behind an on- 
ramp!” 

He paused to catch his breath, 
walked back to the lamp stand and 
picked up the letter. Familiar with 
the contents, he glanced at it only 
briefly this time. He offered it to 
his wife but she declined, so he re- 
turned it to the stand. 

“You know what I have to do 
now, 1 suppose?” 

She nodded, sniffling. 

“Bob was taking that gift to a 
friend in Diego. I’m bound to see 
that it’s delivered.” 

She looked up at him without 
much hope. She knew Frank. 

“I don’t suppose — ” 

He shook his head. His expres- 
sion was gentle but firm. 

“No, hon. I’m taking it down 
myself. I refuse to ship it and i 
certainly won’t ride the Trans. 
Not after all these years. No, I’m 
going down the same way Bob 
went, by the same route. I’ll have 
the J.J. tuned first, though.” 

She looked around dully, pluck- 
ing fitfully at the delicate cover- 
ing of the couch. 

“I suppose you’ll at least take it 
in to — ” 



“Hector? Certainly. In spite of 
what he charges he’s damn well 
worth the money. Best mechanic 
around. I enjoy doing business 
with him. Know I’m getting my 
credit’s worth, at least. We 
couldn’t have me going some- 
where else — now could we? 
Wouldn’t want him to get the idea 
we’re prejudiced or something. 
I’ve been going to him for, oh, five 
years. Almost forgotten what he 
is — ” 

ttriOlNG all the way down to 

UDiego, eh, Mr. Merwin?” said 
the wiry chicano. He was trying to 
rub some of the grease off his 
hands. The filthy rag he was using 
already appeared incapable of 
taking on any more of the tacky 
blue-black gunk. 

“Yeah. So you’ll understand. 
Hector, when I say the J.J.’s got to 
be in tiptop shape.” 

“Ciertamente! You want to open 
her up, please?” 

Frank nodded and moved over 
to where the J.J. rested, just inside 
the rolled-up armor grille entrance 
to the big garage. He slid into the 
deep pile of the driver’s bucket, 
flipped the three keys on the com- 
bination ignition, and then 
jabbed the hood release switch. As 
soon as the hood started up he 
climbed out, leaving the keys in 
the ON position. Hector was al- 
ready bent over the car’s power 
plant, staring intently into the 
works.

“Well, Mr. Merwin, from what I 
can see your engine at least is in 
excellent condition, yes, excel- 
lent! You want me to fill ’er up?” 

Frank nodded wordlessly. He 
wasn’t at all surprised at the me- 
chanic’s rapid inspection of the 
engine. After all, the J.J. had 
been given the best of profession- 
al care and the benefits of his own 
considerable work since he’d 
purchased her. Hector did not 
look up as he set about releasing 
the protective panels over the 
right-side .70 caliber. 

“If I may ask, how do you plan 
to go?” 

Frank had the big Meerschaum 
out and was tamping tobacco in- 
to it. 

“Hmm. Fll go down Burbank 
to the San Diego Freeway and get 
on there. It’d be a little faster to 
get on the Ventura, but on a trip of 
this length that little bit of time 
saved would be negligible and I 
don’t see the point in fighting the 
interchange.” 

Hector nodded approvingly. 
“Quite wise. You know, Mr. Mer- 
win, you’ve got two pretty bad 
stretches on this trip. Very iffy. I 
read — about your son. I sorrow. 
The jornada de la muerte comes 
eventually to all of us.” 

Frank paused in lighting the 
pipe. “Couldn’t be helped,” he said 
tightly. “Bob didn’t realize what 
was — what he was getting into, 
that’s all. I blame myself, too, but 
what could 1 do? He was eighteen 



and by law there wasn’t anything I 
could do to hold him back. He sim- 
ply took on more than he could 
handle.” 

One of Hector’s grease monks 
had wheeled over a bulky ammo 
cart. The mechanic waved the as- 
sistant off and proceeded about 
the loading himself. Frank ap- 
preciated the gesture. 

“A Cad, wasn’t it?” 

“It was.” He was leaning over 
the mechanic’s shoulder, better 
to follow the loading process. 
Never could tell what you might 
have to do for yourself on the 
road. “What are you giving me? 
Explosive or armor-piercing?” 
“Mixed.” Hector slammed 
down the box-load cover to the 
heavy gun. It clicked shut, locked. 
He moved away to get a small, 
curved ladder, wheeled it back. At 
the top he began checking over 
the custom roof turret. “Both, al- 
ternating sequence. True, it’s 
more expensive, but after all 
your son’s car was destroyed by a 
Marauder. A black one?” 

“Yes, that’s right,” said Frank, 
only mildly surprised. “How’d 
you find out?” 

“Oh, among the trade the word 
gets passed along. I know of this 
particular vehicle, I believe. 
Owner does a lot of his own work, 
I understand. That’s tough to tan- 
gle with, Mr. Merwin. Might you 
be thinking of — ” 

Frank shrugged, looked the oth- 
er way. “Never know who you’ll 



WHY JOHNNY CAN'T SPEED 



85 




bump into on the roads these days, 
Hector. I’ve never been one to 
run from a dogfight.” 

“I did not mean to imply that 
you would. We all know your driv- 
er’s combat record, Mr. Merwin. 
There are not all that many aces 
living in the Valley.” 

He gestured meaningfully at 
the side of the car. Eleven silhou- 
ettes were imprinted there. Four 
mediums, four compacts — crazy 
people. Gutsy, but crazy. Two 
sports cars — kids — a jag and a Vet, 
as he recalled. He smiled in rem- 
iniscence. Speed wasn’t every- 
thing. And one large gold stamp- 
ing. He ran his hand over the im- 
pressions fondly. That big gold 
one, he’d gotten that baby on the 
legendary drive out from Indi- 
anapolis, back in ’eighty-three — 
no, ’eighty-two. The Imperial had 
been rough and, face it, he’d been 
lucky as hell, too young to know 
better. Ricochet shots were al- 
ways against the odds, but hell, 
anyone could shoot at tires! So 
he’d thought twenty-odd years 
ago. Now he knew better — didn’t 
he? 

He wondered if Bob had tried 
something equally insane. 

“Yes, well, you watch yourself, 
Mr. Merwin. A Marauder is bad 
news straight from the factory. 
Properly customized, it could 
mount enough stuff to take on a 
Greyhound busnought.” 

“Don’t worry about me. Hec- 
tor. I can take care of myself.” He 



was checking the nylon sheathing 
on the rear tires. “Besides, the J.J. 
mounts a few surprises of her 
own!” 

I T WAS already warm outside, 
even at five in the morning. The 
weather bureau had forecast a 
high of lOr for downtown L.A. 
He’d miss most of that, but even 
with air-control and climate-con- 
ditioning things could get hot. He 
turned on the climate-cool as he 
backed the blue sedan out of the 
garage, put it in drive and rolled 
toward the Burbank artery. 

It was still too early for the real 
rush hour and he had little com- 
pany on the feeder route as he 
moved past Van Nuys Boulevard 
toward the Sepulveda on-ramp. 
A Rambler at the light was slow in 
getting away at the change of sig- 
nal. He blasted the horn once and 
the frantic driver of the heavily 
neutral-marked vehicle made 
haste to get out of his way. The- 
oretically all cars on the surface 
streets were equal. But some were 
more equal than others. 

The Sepulveda on-ramp was an 
excellent one for entering the 
system for reasons other than 
merely being an easier way to 
pass through the Ventura inter- 
change. Instead of sloping up- 
ward as most on-ramps did, it al- 
lowed the driver to descend a high 
hill. This enabled older cars to 
pick up a lot of valuable accel- 
eration easily and also provided

the driver with an aerial over- 
view of the traffic pattern below. 

He passed the commuter car- 
park at the Kester Trans station. 
It was just beginning to fill as the 
more passive commuters parked 
their personal vehicles in favor 
of the public Trans. He felt a surge 
of contempt, the usual reaction 
of the independent motorist to 
milk-footed drivers wilfully 
abandoning their vehicular free- 
dom for the crowding and crum- 
pling of the mass-transit systems. 
What sort of person did it take, he 
wondered for the umpteenth 
time, to trade away his birthright 
for simple sardine-can safety? 
The country was definitely los- 
ing its backbone. He shook his 
head woefully as his practiced 
eye gauged the pattern shifting 
beneath him. 

Mass Trans had required and 
still required a lot of money. One 
way in which the governments in- 
volved (meaning those of most in- 
dustrial, developed nations) 
went about obtaining the neces- 
sary amounts was to cut back the 
expensive motorized forces 
needed to regulate the far-flung 
freeway systems. As the cut- 
backs increased it gradually be- 
came accepted custom among the 
remaining overworked patrols 
to allow drivers to settle their 
own disputes. This custom was fi- 
nalized by the Supreme Court’s 
handing down of the famous Bri- 
er vs. Matthews and the State of 



Texas decision of ’79, in which it 
was ruled that all attempts to 
regulate interstate, nonstop 
highway systems were in direct 
violation of the First Amend- 
ment. 

Any motorist who didn’t feel 
up to potential arguments was 
provided a safe, quiet alterna- 
tive means of transportation in 
the new Mass Trans systems, most 
of which ran down the center and 
sides of the familiar freeway 
routes, high above the frantic traf- 
fic. Benefits were immediate. 
Less pollution from even the fine 
turbine-steam-electric engines of 
the private autos, an end to many 
downtown parking problems in 
the big cities — and more. For the 
first time since their inception the 
freeways, even at rush hour, be- 
came negotiable at speeds close 
to those envisioned by their build- 
ers. And psychiatrists began to 
advise driving as excellent ther- 
apy for persons afflicted with vio- 
lent or even homicidal instincts. 

There were a few — un-American 
dirty commie pinko symps, no 
doubt — who decried the resul- 
tant proliferation of “argumen- 
tative” devices among high-pow- 
ered autos. Some laughable folk 
even talked of an “arms” race 
among automakers. German 
cars made their biggest incur- 
sions into foreign markets in dec- 
ades. Armor plating, bullet- 
proof glassalloy, certain weapon- 
ry — how else did those nuts expect

a decent man to Drive with Con- 
fidence? 

He gunned the engine and the 
supercharged sedan roared down 
the on-ramp, gathering unnec- 
essary but impressive momen- 
tum as it went. Frank had always 
believed in an aggressive en- 
trance. Let ’em know where you 
stand right away or they’ll ride all 
over you. The tactic was hardly 
needed in this instance — there 
were only two other cars in his en- 
trance pattern, both in the far two 
lanes. 

He switched slowly until he 
was behind them, looking into 
rear and side view mirror careful- 
ly for fast-approaching others. 
The lanes behind were clear and he 
had no trouble attaining the 
fourth lane of the five. Safer here. 
Plenty of room for feisty types to 
pass on either side and he could 
still maintain a decent speed with- 
out competing with dragsters. 
He pushed the J.J. up to an easy 
seventy-five miles per, settled 
back for the long drive. 

H e spotted only two wrecks 
as he sped smoothly through the 
Sepulveda pass — about normal 
for this early in the day. The heli- 
crane crew were probably in the 
process of changing shifts, so 
these wrecks would lie a bit longer 
than at other, busier times of day. 

His first view of action came as 
he approached the busy Wilshire 
on-ramps. Two compacts squared 



off awkwardly. The slow lane was 
occupied by a four-door Toyota. 
A Honda coupe, puffing mighti- 
ly to build speed up the on-grade, 
came off the ramp at a bad posi- 
tion. It required one or the other 
to slow for a successful entrance 
and the sedan, having superior 
position, understandably re- 
fused to be the one. Instead of tak- 
ing the quiet course, the Honda 
maintained its original approach 
speed and fired an unannounced 
broadside from its small — .25 cal., 
Frank judged — window-mounted 
swivel gun. The sedan swerved 
crazily for a moment as its driv- 
er, startled, lost control for a few 
seconds. Then it straightened out 
and regained its former atti- 
tude. Frank and the cars behind 
him slowed to give the combatants 
plenty of lane space in which to 
operate. 

The armor glass was taking the 
attack and the sedan began to re- 
turn fire — about equal, standard 
factory equipment, he guessed. 
They were already reaching the 
end of the entrance lane. Desper- 
ately, refusing to concede the 
match, the coupe cut sharply at 
the nose of the sedan. The sedan’s 
owner swerved easily into the 
second lane and then cut tightly 
back. At this angle his starboard 
gun bore directly on the coupe. A 
loud bang heralded a shattered 
tire. With a short, almost slow- 
motion bump, the coupe hit the 
guard rail and flipped over out of 



88 



GALAXY 




sight. In his rear-view mirror 
Frank could just make out the first 
few wisps of smoke as he shot past 
the spot. 

Now that the fight was over, 
Frank floored the accelerator 
again, throwing the victorious 
driver a fast salute. It was re- 
turned gracefully. Considering 
his limited stuff, the fellow had 
done very well. He’d handled that 
figure C with ease, but the man- 
euver would have been useless 
against a larger car. Frank’s own, 
for example. Still, compact driv- 
ers were a special breed and often 
made up for their lack of power, 
engine and fire in sheer guts. He 
still watched Don Railman and his 
Supersub religiously on the 
early Sunday Tele, even though 
the ratings were down badly from 
last season. He’d also never for- 
get that time when a Weekly 
Caripper's Telemanual with old 
Ev Kelly had done a special on 
some hand-tooled Mighty Mite, 
low bore, cut down, with the Web- 
cor anti-tank gun cleverly con- 
cealed in the front trunk. No, it 
paid not to take the compacts, 
even the subs, too lightly. 

He passed the Santa Monica in- 
terchange without trouble. In 
fact, the only thing resembling a 
confrontation he had on the 
whole L.A. portion of the drive oc- 
curred a few minutes later as he 
swept past the Los Angeles Sub- 
International Airport rampings. 

A new Vet, all shiny and gold. 



blasted up behind him. It stayed 
there, tailgating. That in itself 
was a fighting provocation. He 
could see the driver clearly — a 
young girl, probably in her late 
teens. About Bob’s age, he thought 
tightly. No doubt Daddy dear 
had bought the bomb for her. She 
honked at him sharply, insistent- 
ly. He ignored her. She could pass 
him to either side with ease. In- 
stead she fired a low burst of trac- 
ers across his rear deck. When he 
resolutely continued to ignore 
her she pouted, then pulled along- 
side. Giggling, she drew him an 
obscene gesture which even his 
not-so-archaic mind could identi- 
fy. He jerked hard on the wheel, 
then back. Her haughty expres- 
sion disappeared instantly, to be 
replaced by one of fright. When 
she saw it was merely a feint on his 
part, she smiled again, although 
much less arrogantly, and shot 
ahead at a good hundred miles 
per. 

Stupid kid better watch her man- 
ners, never live to make 20,000 
miles. Maybe he should have giv- 
en her a lesson, burnt off a tire, 
perhaps. Oh, well. He had a long 
way to drive. Let someone else 
play teacher. 

He became quiet and watchful 
as he left Santa Ana and entered 
the Irvine area. There was little 
commuter traffic here and only 
a few harmless beachers this ear- 
ly in the day. He saw only one car 
in the Cad’s class and that was an

old yellow Thunderhood. Wasn’t 
sure whether or not to be disap- 
pointed or relieved as he pulled in- 
to the San Clemente rest stop for 
breakfast. He could have eaten at 
home but preferred to slip out 
without waking Myrtle. He’d have 
a couple of eggs, some toast and 
jam and enjoy a view of the Pacif- 
ic along with his coffee despite the 
low clouds which had been rolling 
in for the last twenty minutes. He 
hoped it wouldn’t rain, even though 
rain would cut the heat. Weather 
was one reason he always avoided 
the safer but longer desert 
routes. Thundershowers inland 
were forecast and even the best 
tactical driver could be out- 
matched in a heavy downpour. He 
preferred to be in a situation 
where his talents could operate 
without complications wished on 
him by nature. 

A few warm drops, fat and 
heavy, hit him as he left the diner. 
It had grown much darker and the 
humidity was fierce. Still, Irvine 
was behind him now. Best to make 
speed down to Diego and get home 
before dark. 

He had only the well-policed 
Camp Pendleton lanes ahead and 
then the near-deserted Oceanside 
to La Jolla run before he’d hit any 
real traffic again. Contrary to 
early predictions, the California 
population had spread inland 
instead of along the largely state- 
owned coast. If he’d had sense to 
buy that hundred acres near Mo- 



jave before the airport had gone 
in there . 

On the left he could see the old 
Presidential Palace shining on 
its solitary hill. He waved nostal- 
gically, then speeded up slightly 
as he approached the Pendleton 
cutoff. 

The drizzle remained so light 
he didn’t even bother with wipers. 
Pendleton was passed quickly 
and he had no reason to stop in 
Oceanside. Soon he was cruising 
among rolling, downy hills, mel- 
low in the diffused sunlight. A 
few cattle were the only living 
creatures in evidence, along with 
a few big crows circling lazily 
overhead in the moist air. Once a 
cycle pack roared noisily past, 
long twenties damp with dew. Two 
tricycles headed up the front and 
rear of the pack, but the ugly 
snouts of their recoilless rifles 
were covered against a possible 
downpour. They took no notice 
of him, rumbling past at a solid 
ninety-five miles an hour. He had 
no wish to tangle with a gang, not 
in this empty territory. A good 
driver could knock out three or 
four of the big Harley-Davidsons 
and Yamaharas easily enough, 
but the highly maneuverable 
bikes could swarm over anything 
smaller than a bus or trailer with 
ease, magnifying the effect of 
their light weaponry. 

Maybe he could buy some land 
out here. He gazed absently at the 
green-and-gold hills, devoid of 



90 



GALAXY 




housing tracts and supermar- 
kets. Not another Mojave, may- 
be, but still . 

A sharp honking snapped his at- 
tention reflexively to his mir- 
rors. He recognized the license 
of the big black coupe almost at 
the instant ,he identified the 
make and model. You’re south of 
your territory, fella, he thought 
grimly. His hands clenched tight- 
ly on the wheel as he slid over one 
lane. 

T he Cad pulled up beside him, 
preparatory to passing. He 
judged the moment precisely, 
then tripped a switch on his center 
console. The portside flame- 
thrower erupted in a jet of orange 
flame. The Cad jerked like a singed 
kitten. Instantly Frank cut over 
to the far lane, putting as much 
distance as possible between 
him and the big car, staying slight- 
ly ahead of the other. 

A long dark streak showed clear- 
ly on the coupe’s front, a deep gash 
in the tire material. The Cad 
would have trouble if it tried any 
sharp moves in his direction now 
and Frank saw no problem in 
holding his present position. 
Now he could duck at the first off- 
ramp if need arose. He acti- 
vated the roof turret, an expen- 
sive option, but one which had 
proven its worth time and again. 
Myrtle had opted for the big gre- 
nade launcher, but Frank and the 
GM salesman had convinced her 



that while showiness might be fine 
for impressing the neighbors, on 
the road it was performance that 
counted. The twin fifties in the tur- 
ret commenced hammering 
away at the Cad, nicking big chips 
of armorglass and battle sheath- 
ing from its front. 

Frank was feeling confident 
until a violent explosion rocked 
him nastily and forced him to 
throw emergency power to the 
steering. Frightened, he glanced 
over his shoulder. Thank God for 
the automatic sprinklers! The 
rear of the car above the left wheel 
was completely gone, as was most 
of the rear deck. Twisted, black- 
ened metal and torn insulation 
smoked and groaned. A look at the 
Cad confirmed his worst fears and 
sent more sweat pouring down his 
shirt-collar. No wonder this Ma- 
rauder had acquired such a repu- 
tation! In place of the standard 
heavy Cad machine guns, a Mark 
IV rocket launcher protruded 
from the rear trunk! Fortunately 
the shot had hit at a bad angle or 
he’d be missing a wheel and his 
ability to maneuver would have 
been drastically, perhaps fatal- 
ly, reduced. He did an S just in 
time. Another rocket shrieked 
past his bumper. 

The turret fifties were doing 
their job, but it was slow, too slow! 
Another rocket strike would fin- 
ish him and now the Cad had its big 
guns going, too. He wished to hell 
he was in the cab of a big United 



WHY JOHNNY CAN'T SPEED 



91 




Truckers tractor-trailer, high 
above the concrete, with another 
driver and a gunner on the twin 
60mm’s. A crack appeared in his 
rear window as the Cad’s guns 
concentrated their fire. He turned 
and twisted, accelerated and 
slowed, not daring to give his op- 
ponent another clear shot with 
those Mark IV’s. 

Chance time, Frank, baby. Re- 
member Salt Lake City! 

He cut hard left. The Cad cut 
right to get behind him. At the 
proper (yes, yes!) second he 
dropped an emergency switch. 

The rear back-up lights dropped 
off the J.J.. At the same time a vi- 
olent crrumppl threw him forward 
so hard he could feel the cross-har- 
ness bite into his chest. Fighting 
desperately for control and 
cursing all the way, he slammed 
into the resilient center divider 
with a jolt that rattled his teeth, 
two wheels spinning crazily off 
the pavement, then cut all the way 
back across the five lanes. Fight- 
ing a busted something all the 
way, he managed to wrestle the 
battered sedan to a tired halt on 
the gravel shoulder. 

Panting heavily, he undid the 
safety harness, staggered out of 
the car, bracing himself against 
the metal sides. Behind him, a 
quarter mile or so down the emp- 
ty road, a thick plume of roiling 
black smoke billowed up from a 
pile of twisted metal, plastics and 
ceramics, all intertwined with 



bright orange flame. The big bad 
black Cad was quite finished. He 
took one step in its direction, then 
stopped, dizzied by the effort. No 
driver could survive that inferno. 
In his eagerness to get behind the 
sedan, the Cad’s driver had shot 
over at least one, possibly both of 
the proximity mines Frank had re- 
leased from where his backup 
lights had been. Maybe revenge 
was an outdated commodity to- 
day, but he still felt exhilarated. 
And Myrtle might complain ini- 
tially but he knew damn well she’d 
be pleased inside. 

He became aware of something 
wet trickling down his cheek, 
more than could have come from 
the sporadically dripping sky. 
His hand told him a piece of his 
left ear was missing. The blood 
was staining his good driving 
blouse. Absently he dabbed at the 
nick with a handkerchief. His rear 
glass must have gone at the I^st 
possible minute. A look confirmed 
it, showing two neat holes and a 
third questionable one in his rear 
window. Umm. He’d had closer 
calls before — and this one was 
worth it. At least there’d be one 
license plate to lay on Bob’s grave. 

He sighed. Better stop off in 
Carlsbad and get that ear taken 
care of. Damnation, if only that 
boy had paid some attention in 
Driver’s Ed. Eighteen years old 
and he’d never learned what his 
old man had known for years. 

Be Safe. Drive Offensively. ★

THE 

MOON 

CHILDREN 

I^TII 




WHA THAS GONE BEFORE 

The Moon Children were born to the 
wives of three lunar explorers who had 
become mysteriously contamin- 
ated during an unscheduled moon 
landing in response to a light phe- 
nomenon. 

NICK and KYRIE were born days 
apart, mentally precocious and 
aware of each other before they 
met — and of GUY before he was born 
some months later. Earth had had ex- 
perience of the dangers of contact 
with alien biocosms — particularly 
those of Jupiter and Mercury — and 
the children were hated and feared. 
KYRIE and GUY were rejected even 
by their parents and all three were 
brought up under laboratory condi- 
tions under the aegis of COSMOS, an 
official body. Their immediate 
supervision was in the hands of Nick's 
parents, YURI MARKO and DR. 
CAROLINA CARTER. 

By the age of seven NICK and 
KYRIE were matching wits with 
Earth’s top scientists. NICK solved 
the mystery of the propulsion sys- 
tem used by Jovian delta-life — and 
traded his knowledge for some of the 
moon grit that had contaminated his 
father. The grit held an instant 
message for the children. It told them 
they were not children at all — and not 
human. 



93 




INIQUITY 

IX 

N ick and Kyrie worked all week 
with that great tetrahedron, 
while Guy slept. Nick failed to do 
much with it. Still convinced that 
it was incomplete, he got Marko 
to requisition the moon grit left in 
the vault, hoping that we could 
build the nexode yet another stage 
larger. 

The joint committee released 
the grit with no delay and security 
brought it to the lab in six lead 
drums. Nick opened the drums 
one by one, dipping an anxious 
hand into each, and sank on the 
floor beside the last, sobbing like 
any child who has lost a special 
toy. 

Something had changed the grit 
in the vault. All the crystals had 
lost their glassy hardness; some 
were already crumbling into soot- 
like powder. Nick wanted no more 
of them, but Marko and Carolina 
tried to learn what had happened. 
Their tests showed all the thorium 
gone, most of the gold fused into 
microscopic beads. 

“Burned out,” Marko summed 
up their results. “By what must 
be nuclear or partly nuclear 
reaction. The carbon residue is 
mostly graphite now, mixed with 
stable elements that must be 
fission products. I’d like to know 
what became of the energy re- 
leased.” He crushed a dead crys- 



tal in his palm, frowning at the 
dull black dust. “That energy could 
have exploded the canisters like 
bombs. All it did was overload the 
gold conductors. Even the fission 
products don’t show any residual 
radiation. Where did it go?” 

Nobody knew. Yet, somehow, 
the assembly of the nexode had ex- 
hausted all the crystals in the 
vault. Security was uptight about 
it, suspecting fraud or robbery, 
and the Joint committee de- 
manded a full report. Next day we 
questioned Nick. 

At first he wouldn’t talk. He 
seemed to be merely waiting out- 
side the lab darkroom, where 
Kyrie was working alone with the 
nexode. 

“You don’t want me.’’ He 
shrugged ruefully. “Ask Ky. Or 
Guy, maybe, when he wakes up. 
They can work the nexode. Some- 
how I can’t get the knack of it. I 
don’t know why.” 

“We’ve got to file a report,” 
Marko persisted. “Tell us what 
you can.” 

Nick stared moodily at the 
darkroom door. 

“The nexode’s half machine,” 
he said. We knew that all along. It 
runs on nuclear power. The units 
are like computers — though each 
crystal has more circuits than any 
computer on Earth. That’s the 
part I nearly understand.” 

“The other part?” 

“That’s Kyrie’s.” His small bare 
feet shuffled uncomfortably, as 



94 



GALAXY 




if the floor had gotten hot. “Some- 
thing locks the units together. 
Something reaches out, sensing 
and spending energy. Something 
almost alive.” 

“Alive?” Marko whispered. 
“How?” 

“If the nexode’s like a com- 
puter,” Nick said, “it’s also like a 
brain. The circuits in both are 
pretty much the same. I think the 
nexode is a sort of interface be- 
tween the energy we call physical 
and something else. Another spec- 
trum.” 

“You think the missing energy 
disappeared through that inter- 
face?” Marko squinted doubtfully. 
“I mean, the missing power from 
that fissioned thorium?” 

“Where else?” Nick’s worried 
scowl gave him the look of a small 
old man. “The laws of nature 
stand, though our notions of them 
change. The nexode channels 
energy in unfamiliar ways — as 
the space snakes do. But it’s noth- 
ing more than a device — ” 

He stopped abruptly and ran to 
meet Kyrie as she came out of the 
darkroom. She looked like a tired 
and troubled child again, with no 
sign of that vital power which had 
flowed into her from the new 
nexode. She took Nick’s hand and 
they slipped away to stand for a 
while, watching Guy’s deep sleep. 
When they came back, Marko 
stopped Kyrie to ask what she was 
doing with the nexode. 

“It’s — hard.” Trouble shadow- 



ed her face. “The room has to be 
very dark and still, with nothing to 
distract me. I can’t even think of 
anything except of the nexode 
shining. I just wait — and 

wait — and wait. Sometimes some- 
thing comes.” 

“A message?” 

“Bits of one.” She glanced un- 
happily at Nick. “Maybe most of 
it is lost because the grit lay on the 
moon too long before anybody 
found it. Everything is dim and 
broken. But something — some- 
thing tries to come while I sit there 
in the dark.” 

M arko had more questions, 
but Nick asked us not to delay 
her any longer. Neither slept all 
that week. Kyrie sat hour after 
hour in the darkroom, while Nick 
waited at the door. Image by shad- 
owy image, they put together a 
fragmentary picture. One breath- 
less desert midnight, after Kyrie 
had taken her break and gone back 
to the darkroom, Nick decided to 
share it with us. 

The day had been long and hot 
for me, with a suspicious security 
agent dogging me all afternoon 
with questions I couldn’t answer 
about the affairs of my absent 
brother. I was longing for a quiet 
beer and bed until Nick spoke. 

“Ky’s getting the hang of the 
nexode now.” Beneath his off- 
hand tone, I heard a throb of veiled 
elation. “We’re learning who 
made the grit — and finding a bit of 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



95 




truth in our old baby games about 
our people in space and their tach- 
yon ships.” He grinned soberly. 
“I guess the grit did help me make 
them up.” 

“Your old theory was pretty 
good.” He glanced at Marko with 
a new respect. “There is a great 
galactic culture. A sort of super- 
biocosm. All kinds of races with 
different biologies, united in one 
universal civilization. They’re 
bound together with the cosmic 
altruism that Platon Papanek 
couldn’t find on any of our 
planets — maybe it doesn’t evolve 
very often. 

“Anyhow, the messenger mis- 
siles that carry the grit were scat- 
tered like seed through space to 
spread that great culture — to find 
any new races evolved far enough 
to welcome it. The ships do travel 
faster than light. Ky can’t say yet 
whether they’re really tachyon 
craft, but she says they can’t come 
here without a proper beacon to 
guide them and a proper terminal 
where they can land. 

“That’s our mission — to build 
that terminal!” His lean face 
shone. “The grit was waiting for 
our fathers on the moon. If it was 
seed, they were the soil and we are 
the young plants. The grit made us 
like we are. We are part of a great 
plan that begins somewhere 
among the stars. It can’t end till the 
starships arrive on Earth.” 

We were still up at three o’clock, 
debating the vast implications 



of that, when Kyrie took another 
break. Sudden clouds had veiled 
the moon and we walked back to 
the nursery against a dry wind that 
smelled of brush and dust. 

Kyrie stood over Guy, gently 
stroking his gray-furred face. 
Tears filled her eyes, when he 
moved and whined in his sleep. Her 
face looked pinched and bleak, 
with none of Nick’s elation. He 
fixed her a tray when she came on 
to the kitchen, but she pushed it 
back untasted. 

“What frets you, child?” 
Carolina asked. “Nick was so de- 
lighted with the message you were 
getting.” 

“But I’m afraid.” She glanced 
anxiously at Nick. “Even if we 
get the terminal ready. I’m afraid 
our people will never come.” 

“But Nick says they prom- 
ised — ” 

“A long time ago,” Kyrie said. 
“When I’m reading the nexode, I 
forget how old the grit was. What 
it shows seems like now. But Nick 
says it lay on the moon sixty mil- 
lion years. He says it was old be- 
fore men evolved on Earth.” 

“Is that so bad?” 

She lodked uncomfortably at 
Nick. 

“Ky’s a worryworm.” He made 
a face and gave her a playful push, 
but she refused to smile. “I 
thought she knew more about the 
grit. Now she’s afraid our people 
won’t know us after sixty million 
years.” 



96 



GALAXY 




She nodded unhappily. 

“Maybe they won’t.” Nick’s 
own face turned sober. “It is a 
long time. Perhaps they’re dead by 
now. Perhaps they’ve evolved so 
far they won’t care about us. Per- 
haps they’ve forgotten all about 
scattering the messenger mis- 
siles. Anyhow, no matter what, 
we’ve got to build the beacon and 
the terminal. That’s why we’re 
alive.” 

“We must try,” she whispered. 
“But I’m so afraid.” 

She reached for Nick to take her 
hand. They were trudging back 
through the dark toward the lab as 
we went off to bed. 

G uy woke at noon next day. As 
slow and bearlike as if he had 
never touched the grit, he opened 
my office door and peered vacant- 
ly inside, whining Kyrie’s name. I 
called Carolina and we tried to dis- 
tract him, but he wouldn’t eat and 
he wouldn’t come with me to the 
gym 

He shambled back to Kyrie’s 
empty room and prowled the 
nursery hall until he came to the 
kitchen. There he found the chair 
where she bad sat. He snatched it 
up to sniff at it and blundered out 
of the room, moaning and twitch- 
ing, stooping to scan the floor as if 
his yellow eyes could trace her 
footprints. 

He paused outside as if to sniff 
the wind and ran lumbering to- 
ward the lab. We saw Nick dart out 



to stop him, as shrill and ineffect- 
ual as a small dog trying to inter- 
cept a charging bear. 

“Wait! Please! Ky’s at work — ” 

Guy crumpled Nick with one 
careless slap and drove on through 
the doorway. Nick was flat on the 
concrete walk when we came up, a 
green fly buzzing around his head. 
Naked to the blazing sun, his pale 
body had failed to tan. 

Carolina gathered him into her 
arms. I ran past them into the lab. 
Guy had stopped in the hall, 
shaking his head and peering 
about as if the decayed-hay reek of 
Carolina’s beta cultures had wash- 
ed out Kyrie’s scent. His gray ears 
lifted searchingly. He turned, 
crouched and suddenly froze. 

“Hold it, Guy — ” 

He ignored me. Somehow he had 
located Kyrie. His spread ears 
quivered. He plunged abruptly 
past me, toward the darkroom. I 
was close behind when he reached 
the door. Without pausing to try 
the knob, he went through it like a 
tank. 

I followed him in, stumbling 
over the broken door. The rose- 
colored glow of the nexode was all 
I could see for a moment. Push- 
ing into the dark, I found Kyrie’s 
golden form. She sat on a high 
stool, staring into the great 
tetrahedron as if unaware of Guy. 

Whining like a starving beast, he 
snatched it out of her cupped 
hands. The stool tipped over with 
a crash, but she came down on bare 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



97 




cat feet. For a moment she stared 
up at him, the gold fading fast 
from her stricken face. 

“Baby Guy!” she whispered. 
“What have you done?” She 
caught at his furry arm, her voice 
tremulous with terror. “What 
have you done to Nick?” 

Guy swayed back and forth, 
clutching the rose pyramid in 
both gray paws. Peering into it, his 
eyes grew huge and dull, soot-black 
and yellow-rimmed. His breath 
became a hehvy rasping. 

“Guy, Guy!” she sobbed. 
“You’ve hurt little Nicky!” 

She darted out, but 1 stayed to 
watch Guy with the nexode. His 
slow paws turned it. His blank 
eyes blinked at it. He bent to lick 
its shimmering faces with a pink, 
dripping tongue. At last he cock- 
ed a furry ear to listen while he 
shook it, like some bewildered 
savage with a clock. 

Waiting for the glowing pyra- 
mid to transform him again, I saw 
no change. When he put it to- 
gether, he must have served only as 
a temporary tool, energized for 
that special purpose. The task ac- 
complished, he was not energized 
again. 

Instead, he ran down now. His 
noisy breath grew quiet. His frantic 
movements slowed. He stood 
swaying, staring dimly at the 
pyramid. Slow tears traced black 
streaks in his fur. At last he shook 
his head and shambled away. 1 fol- 
lowed him over the splintered 



door and out of the building. 

Outside, the blaze of sun hurt my 
eyes. Carolina stood swinging 
back and forth, crooning softly, 
rocking Nick in her arms. His thin 
arms hung limp and the green fly 
still droned around his head. Kyrie 
was hovering over him, brushing 
at the fly, but she turned to face 
Guy with a look of sick accusa- 
tion. 

“You’re bad,” she gasped. 
“You — beast!” 

With a roar of sudden fury Guy 
threw the nexode at them. It might 
have struck Nick, but Carolina 
swung him out of the way. It 
grazed her arm with one keen point 
and spun across the lawn. With a 
cry almost of pain Kyrie darted to 
pick it up. 

Trembling and sobbing, Guy 
shuffled after her. Turning her 
stricken face from him, she slip- 
ped around him and brought the 
nexode back to Nick. With a howl 
like a tortured animal’s Guy 
swung abruptly away. Stagger- 
ing blindly, he tripped over the 
curb, picked himself up and reel- 
ed out of sight behind the gym. 
His agonized bellows thinned and 
faded away. 

X 

B y that time a security car had 
arrived. Nick’s thin limbs hung 
floppily as Carolina laid him on the 
rear seat, but I saw a faint color be- 
ginning to spread where the sun 



98 



GALAXY 




had washed his body. She ex- 
amined him back at the nursery, 
while we waited breathlessly. 

“He’s coming around.” She gave 
Kyrie a comforting smile and 
turned to me more gravely. “Bet- 
ter see about Guy.” 

The security men had reported 
Guy running toward the open 
mesa. We followed in the car. 
He was far ahead when we saw 
him, a wild gray animal loping 
into a shimmering blue mirage. 
Bounding over boulders and 
juniper clumps, he almost outran 
us. 

“Wait, Guy! Listen!” 

I leaned from the jolting car to 
call when we were near enough, but 
he didn’t stop. Instead he swerved 
abruptly to attack an isolated 
clump of tall cactus. He dived into 
it, butting and slugging and kick- 
ing the spiny masses, finally em- 
bracing them, howling with self- 
inflicted pain. 

His wild cries choked and died. 
He was asleep or unconscious 
when we reached him, lying flat 
beneath the thorny plant he had 
pulled down upon him. His arms 
and legs were locked around it, 
bristling with broken spines. His 
gray jaws were fixed upon a flam- 
ing purple bloom. All movement 
had ceased, but his barnyard scent 
hung in the heated air, stronger 
than any odor from the flowers. 

We waited for an ambulance to 
take him back to the station hos- 
pital. Needing no anesthetic, he 



lay three hours on the operating 
table while the spines were re- 
moved. No sign of life appeared 
until Nick and Kyrie came to see 
him later, in his room. 

They stood beside his bed until 
he moved and made some stifled 
sound. Kyrie reached to stroke his 
arm. His eyes came open then, yel- 
low and empty, the pupils con- 
tracting at once to expressionless 
points. 

“Guy!” Kyrie sobbed. “Dear 
Guy!” 

His flat head turned. His gray 
ears rose and fell. His vacant eyes 
passed over her and Nick, without 
interest or even recognition. A 
dull growl came out of his throat. 
In a moment he sank laxly back, 
asleep again. 

Kyrie crumpled into a quiver- 
ing little heap and we had to carry 
her out of the room. Nick came 
with her to the nursery. He sat be- 
side her all night. If he ever urged 
her to return to her work with the 
nexode, I didn’t hear him, but she 
was back in the darkroom next 
day, behind a new door. 

Guy slept most of the time for 
many months. His body shrank to 
knobby bones and shabby fur. 
His illness and regression 
puzzled me. Building the nexode, 
Marko suggested, had somehow 
used him up. The loss of the pre- 
cious pyramid, Carolina thought, 
had left him with a psychic 
trauma. I wondered if losing Kyrie 
had not hurt him more. 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



99 




W HEN he began to recover — 
later during the winter — he 
wanted me with him. He used to 
lie watching me, hour after hour, 
with a dumb devotion. He liked to 
rub his fur against me and whined 
with delight when 1 scratched be- 
hind his ears. 

Though Nick and Kyrie came 
several times to see him, he seem- 
ed not to know them. Kyrie 
brought the nexode once and held it 
toward him hopefully. His yel- 
low eyes glanced blankly at it, 
drifted indifferently away. 
Kyrie was stricken and Nick beg- 
ged her not to come back. 

With Caolina’s help I taught 
Guy to speak again. We played 
with his educational toys and 
went to the gym and swam to- 
gether. With food and exercise he 
slowly regained his lost vigor and 
suddenly began to grow again. By 
summer he was twice my weight. 

An odd sense of humor came 
with his returning awareness. He 
used his physical power to tease 
me, letting me nearly win a ten- 
nis game or even a wrestling 
match before he beat me or pinned 
me down. He played alarming 
practical jokes on the security men. 

He found other interests, be- 
sides. One was a dark sturdy girl 
who had been hired to wash glass- 
ware in the exobiology lab. The 
name on her security badge was 
Veronica Geronimo. She claimed 
the famous Apache raider for an 
ancestor, though security later in- 



formed me that she came from the 
Bronx. 

We saw no probable harm in this 
affair. Apache or not, Veronica 
looked competent to protect 
herself even from Guy’s rather 
alarming sex equipment. Marko 
thought Guy needed an emotion- 
al outlet and Carolina seemed re- 
luctant to inhibit the basic be- 
havioral responses of a unique 
biological specimen. 

I wasn’t much surprised when 
Veronica disappeared — Guy 

must have been a problem lover. 
But he was bewildered and dis- 
mayed. He wanted me to help 
him find her. When I went to 
security 1 learned that she had 
been thrown off the mesa for 
peddling marijuana without a 
federal license. 

Guy’s distress produced a new 
crop of clinical symptoms for 
Carolina to record. For the first 
time in his life he couldn’t sleep. 
His fur lost color. His ammoniac 
odor grew sharper. He began 
breaking up furniture, absently 
twisting and snapping a lamp or a 
chair into fragments before he 
saw what he was doing. 

He hadn’t learned to read and 
one day he brought me a note 
smuggled in by a cafeteria worker. 
The tinted paper reeked of cheap 
perfume. Veronica still loved her 
Papa Bear. She Had lost her badge 
and couldn’t come to see him, but 
she was working at the Thunder- 
bird Bar, out on the Albuquerque 



100 



GALAXY 




road. She had a room at the Star- 
ways Flytel, if her Papa Bear re- 
membered his teeny weeny Gold- 
ilocks. 

I tried to decline when Guy 
wanted me to come with him to 
the security office, but he carried 
me there on his shoulder. The 
security men snorted with in- 
dignant scorn when he asked per- 
mission to visit Miss Geronimo. 
Though they were not explicit, they 
seemed to feel that any union be- 
tween Guy and a human girl 
would be wickedly unnatural. 

The acting chief did say he’d be 
damned if he compromised 
security just to coddle a hairy half- 
man. He refused Guy’s request 
and assigned special guards to 
keep him on the mesa. 

Escorting us back to the nursery, 
those new guards wanted to know 
where Guy’s girl was shacking up, 
but he was more astute than I ex- 
pected. Assuming a blank idiocy, 
he managed not to mention the 
Thunderbird Bar or the Starways 
Flytel. 

In spite of security he left the 
mesa that night. How he went was 
never entirely clear. The guards 
put him to bed in a windowless 
room and stood their watch out- 
side. Next morning they found a 
hole in the wall and an empty bed. 

We were frightened for Guy. 
With his nonhuman look, he 
would be in danger everywhere. 
Though the government was sup- 
pressing news of the space invas- 



ion, facts enough were leaking out 
to kindle an anti-alien hysteria. 

Carolina had kept us informed 
of what she knew about the invas- 
ion, which was enough to upset us 
all. As a distinguished exobio- 
logist, she was on a special list to 
receive the classified reports. 
Low-ranking officials were 
streaming to Skygate to consult 
her about the dangers from space 
and she was often called away to 
advise those higher up. Even she 
was perplexed and disturbed. 

The Earth platform had begun 
reporting anomalous fogs at sea. 
Shallow but oddly dense, they oc- 
curred unpredictably at points 
which made nonsense of the of- 
ficial theory that they were due to 
unexpected shifts in the cold 
ocean currents. Several fishing 
vessels were reported lost in them 
before the censors closed the lid 
on such unsettling facts. 

The news about the flying snakes 
was equally disturbing. Follow- 
ing our rockets home, those re- 
markable space creatures had ex- 
plored the moon and investigated 
the Earth platform and had now 
begun diving into our own at- 
mosphere. 

When their appearances be- 
came too frequent for the censors 
to deny them entirely, COSMOS 
released an official opinion that 
they meant no harm. Perhaps that 
was true. Certainly they seemed 
more playful than hostile, al- 
though their intentions were 



THEMOON CHILDREN

never quite clear. They were evi- 
dently interested in human 
activities and obviously attracted 
to heat — like Nick’s flying plank, 
they somehow converted ther- 
mal energy into motion. They be- 
gan diving out of space to escort 
our aircraft, as dolphins used to 
escort ships. Whatever their mo- 
tives, the results were unfortu- 
nate. Drained of heat and power, 
the escorted aircraft often crash- 
ed. 

The word “otheron” had begun 
to spread that year on the waves of 
secrecy and rumor and uncon- 
vincing denial. It denoted any- 
thing from another biocosm, 
moon child or space snake, cul- 
tured beta-form or imagined in- 
vader. Guy was an otheron, and 
we were concerned for his life. 

H e was gone two months. His 
disappearance was never widely 
advertised — for fear on the part of 
those concerned of touching off a 
panic — but Skygate security did 
organize an intensive secret 
search. Marko and I made sever- 
al fruitless trips, following clues 
of our own and notions of Kyrie’s, 
but Guy wasn’t easy to find. 

Our knowledge of his first seven 
weeks of freedom became mostly 
inference drawn from a trivee 
series screened the following 
year. Veronica Geronimo was the 
narrator of / Loved A Monster, 
and her lurid drama must have 
been at least partly true. Later I 



saw Guy himself watching the 
program, chuckling silently. He 
confirmed a few details for me, 
though he would never talk to 
security. 

It seems that he and Veronica 
covered most of North America, 
living and traveling in a series of 
rented or perhaps stolen heli- 
cabins. To the confusion of 
security, it developed that Guy 
himself had been on trivee half a 
dozen times during the manhunt. 

Disguised in tiger-skin shorts 
and stripes painted on his own fur, 
billed as Monk Tigerhide, he had 
competed as a professional 
wrestler, dutifully winning or los- 
ing as Veronica and her friends de- 
sired, until he had inadvertently 
damaged too many opponents. 

In ways never revealed to Inter- 
nal Revenue, the two had collected 
a considerable fortune. Tax of- 
ficials intercepted Veronica as 
she attempted to leave the coun- 
try the following year with near- 
ly six and a half million in un- 
explained World Bank globals. 

Abruptly, on the helistage of the 
Manhattan Hudson, that gro- 
tesque comedy had turned into dis- 
aster. Veronica must have been 
wearing too many jewels. A team 
of burglars broke into the helicab- 
in. Guy collared one of them, 
but the other got away. He had 
seen Guy nude and he spread the 
news of a Moon Kid in town. 

With her own sure instinct for 
survival Veronica escaped. The 



102 



GALAXY 




captured burglar seems to have 
gone along, replacing Guy as her 
consort. Guy himself was left to 
face the mob, naked and alone. 
Fighting bare-handed, he threw 
four men off the helistage and hurt 
a dozen others, but he was finally 
overcome. 

Left for dead, if too tough to be 
dismembered, he was picked up 
by the riot police and finally sent 
back to Skygate nailed up in a 
guarded box. Though his odor was 
overwhelming when we opened it, 
Carolina decided that he was still 
alive. The space doctors disagreed, 
but she made them let her keep 
him in a hospital room. After long 
weeks of something between death 
and sleep, he sat up to beg for a 
steak. 

XI 

C AROLINA was gone three 
months from Skygate the next 
fall, on an unexplained assign- 
ment. Busy with security officials 
the day she returned, Marko ask- 
ed me to meet her plane. She look- 
ed so tired and troubled that I 
asked what was wrong. She said 
nothing till we were alone in the 
car. 

“It’s the fog,” she told me then. 
Anxious to know more, but dif- 
fident about prying into confi- 
dential matters, I drove on with- 
out comment. She frowned, hesi- 
tated. 

“Don’t talk about it,” she said at 



last. “But the government is get- 
ting the jitters. I was called in to 
lead a secret research group. Our 
instructions were to learn what 
the fog is and what to do about it.” 
She drew a weary breath. “I’m 
afraid our report won’t cure any 
jitters.” 

Again I waited while she stared 
at the desert moodily and as if 
each twisted juniper had been some 
kind of space alien in disguise. 
When I had to brake and swerve to 
avoid a speeding security airtrac, 
she looked absently back at me. 

“We tried.” The flatness of her 
tone added that they had also fail- 
ed. “The military called for an 
all-out effort. They gave us all the 
people and equipment we asked 
for and all the data anybody has. 
We tried everything. Mapped the 
fog. Photographed what we 
could. Tested the fog for every 
sort of radiation. Dropped tele- 
metered instruments into them 
with rockets and parachutes. 
Towed scoops from aircraft to col- 
lect samples. Questioned every 
surviving observer and every 
crackpot with a theory.” 

“And what is the fog?” 

“We still don’t know. The 
photographs show mostly 
splotches of featureless white. 
The radiometers found nothing 
unusual. The telemetry never 
worked. The surface samples 
weren’t much more than a bad 
odor by the time we got them back 
to the lab. We got no deep samples 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



103 




at all — something caught the 
scoops and broke the lines. Don’t 
ask me what.” Her somber eyes 
swept me blankly and drifted 
back to the desert. “The military 
isn’t very happy about it, but those 
negative results make up the 
main content of our report. We 
were asked to draw conclusions, 
but nobody liked our ideas. If you 
want to hear them — ” 

I said I did. 

“I think the fog is a manifesta- 
tion of life. Life from another bio- 
cosm — which one, I can’t say. The 
surface samples died and de- 
cayed too fast to tell us much, but 
the evidence indicates to me that 
the surface layer is made of tiny 
bubble-shaped organisms, prob- 
ably inflated with hydrogen. 
They’re hygroscopic and very 
fragile. Dryness kills them.” 

I asked about the deeper layers. 

“Nobody knows what’s under- 
neath.” Her uneasy voice sank 
until I could barely hear it. “But it 
must be something more than 
microscopic. Something strong 
enough to snap our scoops off the 
lines. Something hostile enough to 
seize every ship the fog overtakes. 
Something cunning enough to 
outwit all of us.” 

“You mean — intelligent?” 

“Call it whatever you want.” I 
saw her shiver. “It unnerved us. 
The fog spreads in the dark. It has 
been reported creeping up on 
ships and isolated beaches in a way 
that looks deliberate. It does re- 



treat from the light — 1 think sun- 
light dries and kills those micro- 
scopic balloon cells. When the fog 
goes, nothing alive is left behind. 
Just a red, stinking slime.” 

She sat tor a moment in fore- 
boding silence. 

“Another item,” she added sud- 
denly. “The fog doesn’t like in- 
vestigation. During daylight it 
retreated from our parachuted in- 
struments and even from a sur- 
face laboratory ship — which it 
later overtook in the dark. Every 
patch of fog that we tried to study 
melted rapidly back into the sea.” 
She brightened eagerly as we 
came in view of the nursery build- 
ing. 

“That’s about it,” she said. “If 
you want to know what the fog 
really is, all I have is the theory we 
cooked up for our report. The 
phenomenon is clearly an intru- 
sion from some other biocosm. 
Wherever they evolved, the in- 
truders have been changed — by 
mutation or more likely by meta- 
morphosis — to adapt them for 
survival in the oceans of earth.” 
“Why are they invading?” 

“Let’s get on to a more cheerful 
topic.” She cut me off firmly. 
“How are Nick and Kyrie?” 

E FOUND them hard at work 
on their plans for the tr^nsga- 
lactic terminal. In spite of all our 
warnings, they were determined 
that COSMOS could be persuad- 
ed to build it. 




104 



GALAXY 




Kyrie spent most of her days and 
nights shut up alone in the dark- 
room with the tetrahedron, 
groping for the bits and pieces of its 
half-erased message. Nick’s draft- 
ing table was the floor of a room 
across the hall. He worked lying 
flat, often calling Kyrie in so that 
he could show her the emerging dif- 
ficulties and tell her what to search 
for. 

The following summer, as those 
problems began taking clearer 
shapes, Marko helped select a 
team of specialists to write the 
specifications and prepare the 
final drawings for COSMOS. 
Most of these experts had been 
with the famous “triple E” — Ex- 
Earth Engineers — the prime con- 
tractor for the seeker vehicles and 
several planet platforms. Ac- 
customed as they were to vast 
space projects, they were dazed by 
the dimensions Nick demanded 
for the tachyon terminal. 

After ten days of nonstop talks 
with Nick, they invited Marko 
and me to Join a conference at the 
Skygate Hudson. Kyrie stayed 
behind in the darkroom, trying 
to fill some gap in the record. 
Nick sat between Marko and me 
at the long table, facing the 
engineers. In blue trunks, pale and 
naked to the waist, he looked 
perilously young and small and 
vulnerable. 

The seven engineers were sober 
and mature veterans of space, 
armed with rolled blueprints and 



entrenched behind portable 
computers and thick stacks of 
data. They shuffled their docu- 
ments and scowled at Nick, wait- 
ing for their spokesman to begin. 
He was Ken McAble, a wiry, 
brown and dynamic Yankee who 
had tested his own hardware in 
orbit around several planets. 

“I’ll tell you why we’re here.’’ 
His ice-green eyes shifted un- 
easily from Nick to Marko and 
then to me. “We’ve got plenty of 
space know-how.” He nodded ap- 
provingly at his fellow engineers, 
three on either side. “We’ve done 
some difficult things. I think 
we’re competent to say what is 
feasible and what is not. I believe 
we all agree that this so-called 
tachyon terminal is just not pos- 
sible.” 

The men around him nodded 
solemnly. 

“But it can be,” Nick objected 
sharply. “It has to be.” 

“Just look at it.’’ McAble 
fumbled through a stack of papers 
and held up a sketch of the ter- 
minal — the six outer towers with 
their landing stages rising like a 
spiral stair around the taller cen- 
tral beacon. 

“Ten miles tall.” He pursed his 
lips and shook his head. “Equipped 
to dock and refit tachyon ships 
with diameters up to half a mile. 
The machinery works on prin- 
ciples we never heard of and the 
specifications call for materials 
unknown on Earth.” 



THE MOON CHILDREN

“Please, sir?” White and trem- 
bling, Nick stood up in his chair. 
“We’ll explain the principles. 
We’ll all tell you how to make the 
new materials.” 

“Look at these dimensions.” 
McAble waved his sketch. “They 
reduce the Great Pyramid to a 
wart. Our preliminary estimates 
are still pretty rough, but they run 
to something like three point seven 
billion tons — of structural 
materials we don’t have names 
for.” 

WflTE KNOW it won’t be easy, 

■V sir.” Nick spoke too fast, as 
he often did when he was too 
gravely worried to remember the 
slow comprehension of ordinary 
men. “That’s why we’re asking 
COSMOS to take it over. All the 
nations must unite — ” 

“COSMOS!” McAble snorted. 
“COSMOS is already stinking 
dead. Its builders mistook the 
other planets for a free lunch. Now 
it looks like we’re going to be the 
free lunch for all the other bio- 
cosms.” 

“But, sir! This trouble with the 
other biocosms is exactly why the 
terminal has to be built. The 
messenger missile was sent to pre- 
pare us for this very mo- 
ment — when space flight is just be- 
ginning. Don’t you see? Don’t any 
of you see?” 

Nick caught his breath and 
looked desperately along the line of 
doubtful faces. 



“New biocosms need help to un- 
derstand each other. The terminal 
beacon can bring that help — but we 
must have it soon. Without it, our 
own biocosms will probably kill 
one another. Can’t you see that, 
sir? Building the terminal, we’re 
running a race to save the lives of 
Earth and Venus and all our other 
neighbors. Don’t you — don’t you 
see — ” 

His forlorn voice slowed and 
stopped. I could hear a muffled 
clatter from the dining room. The 
sluggish air felt too cold and 
smelled faintly of fish. Nick 
gulped hard. I thought he was go- 
ing to cry. 

A pencil dropped and rolled. 
Two fattish engineers whispered 
together and one of them passed a 
paper to McAble. He squinted at 
it, cleared his throat and scowled at 
Nick again. 

“We do have one suggestion that 
might be productive,” he said. “If 
you care to consider it.” 

“Yes, sir!” Nick gasped. “Of 
course.” 

“It has occurred to several of us 
that these plans are far too 
elaborate.” He tapped his sketch 
and nodded at the fattish engi- 
neers. “This terminal we’re talk- 
ing about would dock a whole fleet 
of starships. It seems to us that we 
might begin with simpler facilities 
for Just one ship. Can’t you modi- 
fy the plans?” 

“I wish I could.” Nick shrugged 
unhappily. “The terminal is large 



106 



GALAXY 




on our scale, but not on the cosmic 
scale. The stars are far apart. A 
tachyon beacon has to have a cer- 
tain power to reach ships or other 
terminals at all. A weaker beacon 
would be no good. Anyhow, we 
can’t change the plans.” 

“And why not?” 

“You see, sir, we’re not 
designing anything ourselves. We 
don’t know enough. We’re only 
reading out the specifications 
recorded in the messenger missile 
sixty millions years ago — and now 
partly lost.” 

“1 think they should have been 
simpler in the first place.” 

“I’m afraid you don’t under- 
stand, sir. There are too many bil- 
lions of planets. Too many life 
forms always evolving — but too 
few that ever need or want to join 
the great galactic culture. The 
starships can’t visit them all. Only 
those that build a terminal are con- 
sidered worth an interstellar trip. 
It’s how we qualify for transgalac- 
tic membership.” 

McAble frowned at that and 
finally turned the meeting over to 
his fellow engineers. They began 
asking technical questions about 
structural materials for the towers, 
about the operation of the beacon, 
about tachyon propulsion and the 
minimum-energy shift to the tach- 
yon state. Nick’s answers were 
confusing to me and also, 1 think, 
to them. 

Marko sent out for coffee and, 
Jater, for sandwiches. With an 



afternoon break to let Nick 
assemble and demonstrate a sec- 
ond flying plank, the meeting 
lasted all day. Four of the engi- 
neers left Skygate that night, but 
McAble and two others decided to 
stay — “Just for the hell of it — ” 
McAble said. They worked for 
nearly a year with Nick and Kyrie, 
producing machines they never 
really understood. 

W HEN their proposal was fi- 
nally ready for COSMOS the 
presentation had to be delayed 
because a jet carrying most of the 
European directors had been lost 
over the Atlantic. Official censor- 
ship veiled the details, but one sur- 
vivor who had missed the flight 
turned up later to tell us that 
friendly space snakes had flown 
too near the plane, killing the 
motors and forcing it down into a 
patch of that anomalous fog. 

Other members canceled out, 
until only the American and Sino- 
Soviet delegations came for the 
final presentation. The American 
group was headed by Erik Thor- 
sen. Marko and 1 called on him the 
day he arrived at his official resi- 
dence. 

1 barely recognized him. He was 
an old man now, stooped and slow, 
his face sternly tragic. His blood- 
less hands had a ceaseless tremor. 
1 suppose the psychiatry had been 
successful, but 1 felt sorry for him. 
He greeted us stiffly and waited to 
see what we wanted. He didn’t ask 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



107 




about the children, Suzie or any- 
body else. 

We tried to brief him for Nick’s 
presentation. He listened silently, 
gray lips compressed, now and 
then shaking his cadaverous 
head. When we had finished he 
promised curtly to see us at the 
meeting, but I could see that he 
didn’t mean to be convinced. 

W E MET the next day in the 
tarnished splendor of the Hall 
of Worlds, built when the great 
dreams of COSMOS were still 
alive. Clustered around the podi- 
um, our little group left the long 
chambers nearly empty and rolling 
echoes seemed to mock our fading 
hopes. 

Maxim Petrov came in at the 
head of the Sino-Soviets. A 
vigorous thick-set man, he shook 
hands cordially with all his old 
friends and smiled with a startled 
admiration at Kyrie when she and 
Nick came in. 

One of his advisers surprised us 
more. A short, stout, brown man 
with thick untidy hair and dark 
sunglasses, he had arrived on 
Petrov’s plane and spent the night 
in the Sino-Soviet residence. 
When he took off the glasses I 
recognized my brother Tom. 

Less cordial than Petrov, he 
waved a pudgy hand at Marko and 
me, lighted a long yellow nar- 
corette and put on another pair of 
glasses to study our terminal plans. 
After all our preparation, that 



meeting was a brief anticlimax. 
The delegates frowned over the 
bulky handouts. Kyrie displayed 
the tetrahedron. Nick explained 
the purpose of the messenger 
missile, then called on Ken 
McAble to brief the delegates on 
our proposal for the tachyon 
terminal. 

“I came in as a skeptic,” 
McAble began. “But I’ve been 
convinced. I’ll grant that the task 
of erecting this terminal will tax 
the resources of the planet. But I 
think it can be done — and I say 
we’ve got to do it.” 

He raised his voice above a mur- 
mur of startled protest. 

“The alternative is death. Alone, 
we can’t cope with the other bio- 
cosms we have encountered on 
Venus and Mercury and else- 
where. We don’t know how to deal 
with the space snakes now in our 
own atmosphere, or with what- 
ever is moving into our seas.” 

Thorsen stood up, but McAble 
wouldn’t stop. 

“1 believe the creatures of our 
neighbor biocosms have found it 
just as hard to understand or cope 
with us. The exobiologists are 
suggesting that we have gravely 
disturbed the ecology of Venus 
and I’m afraid we have given the 
other biocosms no reason to love 
us.” 

McAble still ignored Thorsen’s 
quivering hand. 

“Gentlemen, this is a turning 
point in the lives of our planets. 



108 



GALAXY 




The terminal can bring us the 
means to understand and bridge 
our differences. It can open a door 
to all the benefits of the trans- 
galactic civilization — wonders I 
don’t dare imagine. Without the 
terminal, I think we’re dead.” 

Recognized at last, speaking in 
an old man’s slow falsetto. Thor- 
sen said there were too many space 
aliens already on Earth. He didn’t 
intend to import any more. The 
American delegation was voting 
to reject the proposal. 

Maxim Petrov spoke longer and 
less vehemently. His technicians 
had discovered many items of 
exciting interest in the terminal 
plans, which would be carried back 
to Peking for additional study. He 
understood the grave hazards of 
contact between unaided bio- 
cosms and he recognized a grow- 
ing danger to the life of Earth. If 
Nick’s proposal had been made 
just a few years earlier, the Sino- 
Soviet might have been able to sup- 
port the terminal project. Un- 
fortunately, however, in his 
opinion the crucial turning point 
had now passed. Already under in- 
creasing pressure from space in- 
truders and divided by growing 
suspicions that the moon children 
and perhaps other space aliens 
were secretly meddling in human 
affairs, the nations of Earth could 
never unite to erect it. Regret- 
fully, therefore, the Sino-Soviet 
was forced to join the Americans 
in voting to kill the proposal. 



Moreoever, since the seeker sur- 
veys had failed to open up new liv- 
ing space for the human prole- 
tariat — or even to develop any im- 
portant new industrial resources 
for the workers of Earth — the 
Sino-Soviet and its allies were giv- 
ing notice of withdrawal from 
COSMOS. Formal claims would 
be filed for the assets and privileges 
properly due them under the char- 
ter. 

Nick and Kyrie should have been 
prepared, of course, for such an 
outcome, but they had never 
learned to make reasonable 
allowances for the ignorance and 
stupidity of ordinary human be- 
ings. Shattered, they clung to- 
gether, sobbing piteously. Marko 
and Carolina tried to console 
them, but they wouldn’t talk to 
anybody. 

XII 

P ETROV gathered his delegates 
to leave the Hall of Worlds. My 
brother burst out of the group and 
scuttled across to Thorsen, beg- 
ging for political asylum. Thorsen 
called him a traitor and turned his 
back on him. Sweating and 
gasping, Tom dashed to Marko 
and me. 

“Kim! My baby brother!” He 
enveloped me in a fleshy embrace 
and the rich aroma of his armpits. 
“And my old comrade — Yuri! It’s 
grand to see you both.” 



THEAAOON CHILDREN

Mark took his offered hand, 
somewhat hesitantly. 

“I need your help,” he wheezed. 
“But you need mine — ^just as much. 
I can help you — help you build that 
terminal.” 

“Help us?” Marko squinted at 
him skeptically. “How?” 

“I’ve got contacts.” His cal- 
culating eyes rolled toward the 
Sino-Soviets. “I’ve got influence. 
I’ve got know-how. I’ve got every- 
thing you need to get the project 
moving. And that’s a fact. Trust 
me, Kim. You’ve just got to trust 
me, Yuri.” 

Of course we couldn’t trust him, 
but I saw no harm in listening. We 
had very little to lose. Though I 
had learned to fear his slippery re- 
sourcefulness, I couldn’t help 
yielding to his old shrewd charm. 

“What know-how?” Marko was 
demanding. “Contacts with 
whom?” 

Tom shrugged. He spoke 
evasively. This was no place to dis- 
cuss such delicate matters and the 
deal he wanted to offer us would 
take too long to explain. His 
hurried whisper turned frantic. He 
couldn’t go back to the Sino- 
Soviet. If we refused to take him 
in, he was prepared to destroy 
himself. 

“I’m your last chance. Believe 
me, Kimmie, you’ll never get your 
terminal built without my con- 
tacts.” 

Marko finally agreed to talk to 
Thorsen. Tom stayed close to me. 



mopping at his wet face and watch- 
ing the Sino-Soviet delegation as 
if he expected to be dragged away. 

Petrov, however, accepted the 
situation with fine diplomatic 
suavity. Returning to the podium, 
he announced that the defector 
was a running dog of capitalism 
and a proven enemy of the people. 
His ruthless criminal activities 
had betrayed the trust of the world 
proletariat and he was no longer a 
welcome guest of the Sino-Soviet. 
Concluding, Petrov offered us an 
ironic farewell and departed with 
his delegation, leaving Tom be- 
hind. 

Angered by the whole affair, 
Thorsen put Tom under guard and 
took him back to the American 
residence. We didn’t see him again 
for several weeks — or until the 
final dismemberment of COSMOS 
had been completed. 

Title to the mesa and all the Sky- 
gate facilities reverted to America, 
as the charter provided. Suddenly 
recommissioned a Space Force 
general, Thorsen assumed com- 
mand. He disbanded the old 
international security force and 
organized his own new security 
arm. 

In the long squabble over the as- 
sets of COSMOS, Petrov de- 
manded the tetrahedron for the 
Sino-Soviet. Refused that, he 
wanted Kyrie. When Marko 
pointed out that the tetrahedron 
was useless to us without her to 
read it, he offered to settle for 



no 



GALAXY 




Nick. Thorsen seemed willing to 
surrender him, but Carolina pro- 
tested bitterly that Kyrie would die 
without him. There was no de- 
mand for Guy. 

Petrov agreed at last to let 
America keep the children and the 
tetrahedron. In return, the Sino- 
Soviet took over the remaining 
space facilities of COSMOS, 
which had dwindled by now to the 
Earth and moon platforms and the 
nearly abandoned installations on 
the surface of the moon. 

W HEN Petrov and his people 
were finally gone Thorsen had 
us bring the children to a briefing 
room in the old COSMOS head- 
quarters, which now flew his own 
flag. Nick and Kyrie perched on 
tall stools, squirming itchily in 
stiff white coveralls and a frilly 
pink little-girl dress. Carolina 
hovered behind them. The nexode 
lay on the table before them, one 
point of opulent splendor in that 
ugly, barren, military room. 

Guy sat with me at the side of 
the room, too big for his chair, his 
odorous and hairy masculinity 
cloaked in a plaid raincoat. Flat 
and bright and empty, his yellow 
eyes weren’t looking at Nick and 
Kyrie — or the armed guards 
around us or anything at all. 

A heavy cast-bronze ashtray lay 
on the table before us — a dough- 
nut-shaped replica of the moon 
platform. He picked it up in his 
massive paws, turning it ab- 



sently. Presently I heard a crack 
like a gunshot and saw that he had 
snapped it in two. The guards 
around us were startled, but Guy 
sat fingering one of the frag- 
ments, unaware of anything 
amiss. Before we left he had 
broken the bronze into a dozen 
lumps. 

The guards stood up when Thor- 
sen came in with his new security 
chief. Major Gort was a tall, lank, 
sallow man with sparse red hair 
and sleepy greenish eyes. He 
moved with an unmilitary slouch 
and spoke in a hoarse undertaker 
whisper. 

Thorsen had put on a kind of 
armored arrogance along with his 
two new stars. Scowling at the chil- 
dren as if they stood accused of 
something unspeakable, he intro- 
duced Gort and laid down new 
rule.c for us. 

“Skygate’s a fortress now.” 
Staring at the many-colored pyra- 
mid as if hypnotized, he re- 
covered himself with a spasmodic 
twitch. “We’re setting up a strictly 
military effort to control all our 
space contacts — and we’re on the 
front line here.” 

“Father, please!” Kyrie raised 
her hand like a child in school. 
“Won’t we be allowed to work on 
the terminal — ” 

“Absolutely not.” He scowled 
bleakly. “We’re losing a war with 
the space aliens already around us. 
Our mission here is to perfect new 
defenses.” His sunken eyes flashed

to Nick. “The engineers think your 
flying beer can might be used to 
propel a missile fast enough to 
knock out the space snakes.” 

“But, sir — ” Nick’s small voice 
shook — “we were born to build the 
terminal. We can’t waste our- 
selves killing other creatures.” 
Thorsen’s gaunt face lost color. 
He gulped and reached for a glass 
of water that Gort was hastily 
pouring. It shook and spilled over 
his hand. 

“Now get this,” he rasped at 
last. “COSMOS is dead. Sky- 
gate’s a military post — and you’ll 
all obey my orders. You’ll forget 
that terminal. You’ll waste no 
time on what you call pure re- 
search — on what you call 
knowledge for its own sake.” 
Carolina tried to say something 
about academic freedom. 

“Get this!” The cracked voice 
rose to cut her off. “We’re fighting 
for survival. Space war is a new 
game. We'can lose it to a bug from 
Saturn or maybe win it with 
Nick’s beer car. Every act will have 
to fit our total military effort. Get 
me?” 

“I get you, General.” Carolina 
stung him with her tone. 

“All of you had better get — ” 
His face turned dark and his old 
voice broke. He gulped water, 
cleared his throat and tried to 
smile. “Don’t take me wrong. We 
used to be friends. I don’t want to 
injure anybody. Remember — 1 
didn’t trade the kids to Petrov. I’ll 



try to keep you here as you are if 
you’ll only play the game. But get 
this — ” 

His dull eyes swept across us, 
one by one. 

“Marko.” This was a grim 
stranger speaking, no longer 
Marko’s old comrade on the 
moon. “Hodian. Carolina. If you 
fail to see things my way, you’ll be 
replaced. You may not see the 
kids again. Am I clear?” 

“You’re clear. General Thor- 
sen,” Carolina whispered bitterly. 
“Very clear.” 

I hated Thorsen from that day, 
yet I felt a growing pity for him, 
too. Bewildered and despairing, 
he was fighting desperately for the 
survival of the only world he 
knew. As much as I loved Nick and 
Kyrie and Guy, I, too, had come 
from his old world. I could feel his 
tragedy. 

6 UY growled once, softly, just 
before Thorsen rose to close the 
meeting. Even then he didn’t look 
at Nick and Kyrie, but I could see 
them bending eagerly over the 
tetrahedron, their intent faces 
turning brown again in its grow- 
ing light. Absorbed in it, they 
started when Carolina spoke to 
them. 

“Please! Let’s go back to the 
lab.” Kyrie whispered eagerly. “I 
think we’ve found something 
new.” 

“A weapon?” Carolina was sar- 
donic. 



112 



GALAXY 




Kyrie looked hurt and shook her 
head. 

“We don’t know.” Nick was still 
staring into the tetrahedron, his 
eyes oddly dilated. “We don’t 
know yet.” 

Major Gort sent a security car to 
take them to the lab, and they 
entered the darkroom together. 
They stayed all day. Late that 
night, worried about them, Caro- 
lina knocked and went in. 

She found them lying like two 
children on the floor, the tetra- 
hedron glowing splendidly be- 
tween them. Their wide eyes were 
fixed on it and they didn’t move un- 
til she touched them. 

She persuaded them to take a 
break. They came to the kitchen, 
walking dreamily together with 
intimate collisions of hips and 
shoulders, as if what they were 
finding had been some delightful 
new awareness of each other. 
Silent about the nexode, they 
gulped a little orange juice and 
hurried back to the darkroom. 

T HORSEN called my office the 
next morning. My brother was 
to be questioned and he wanted 
me present. The interrogation 
took place in the same briefing 
room. Major Gort presided. Tom 
came in between two guards, who 
led him to a chair and stood alert 
behind him. 

He looked puffy with soft, fat, 
rumpled and seedy. Squirming un- 
easily under Gort’s sleepy stare, he 



caught my eye and grinned ap- 
pealing, turned nervously to beg 
his guards for a narcorette, stared 
defiantly back at Gort. 

“Mr. Hood, we’re considering 
your request for sanctuary,” Gort 
began at last. “Before we can do 
you any favors, you have a good 
deal to explain.” 

“I’m no crook.” Tom’s voice 
shook with indignation. “I’m an 
astronaut. I was trained by 
COSMOS. After retirement, I 
took a civilian job in a member 
nation — a right guaranteed by the 
charter and my COSMOS con- 
tract. Now I’ve come home to see 
my brother and my son. Is that 
criminal?” 

“We’ve heard about your 
civilian jobs.” Gort’s cat-eyes were 
blankly alert, as if Tom were a 
tricky mouse. “I believe one of 
them was smuggling moon grit.” 

“But that was a kosher deal.” 
Tom looked offended. “I was a 
legitimate agent, acting for Mr. 
Howard Hudson. He mined the 
grit on the moon. His operations 
there were legally licensed, with all 
fees paid.” 

“That grit was stolen from un- 
der the nose of Moon Control.” 

“Perhaps it was mined in the 
dark.” Tom shrugged. “Hudson 
didn’t make his billions sitting on 
his tail.” 

“You sold the grit,” Gort re- 
sumed. “As part of your payment 
you were employed, I believe, by 
the Sino-Soviet.” 



THEMOON CHILDREN

“I was hired as a space 
engineer.” Tom’s voice stayed 
level, but his fat dark face shone 
with sweat. “I soon found, how- 
ever, that all they wanted was my 
genes — the altered genes I had 
brought back from the moon. I was 
sent to a lab in the Gobi to breed 
more moon children.” 

“So we’d heard.” Gort nodded 
sleepily. “What were the results?” 
“Not good,” Tom said. “The 
experiment lasted five years. A 
dozen creatures were born alive. 
Not one was even semihuman. 
Three lived a year or longer, but 
they’re all dead now.” He hunched 
and shuddered. “Hideous little 
things. I couldn’t bear to see 
them.” 

“You did other research with the 
grit?” 

“As a matter of fact, I did.” 
Tom’s bulgy eyes widened warily. 
“I had a fine staff. We repeated 
most of your early work here. We 
were able to assemble a couple of 
second-stage tetahedrons, though 
none so large as yours. I think we 
learned a few things you don’t 
know.” 

“Such as what?” 

New uses for the tetrahedrons.” 
“We’ll get to that.” Gort 
crouched a little, like a cat about 
to spring. “Now — why did you 
defect?” 

“The project had gone kaput.” 
Tom’s puffy shoulders drooped 
expressively. “My sperm had gone 
bad. All our moon grit had turned 



to dust — drained, I suppose, by 
your tetrahedron. The Gobi lab 
was abandoned to the space 
snakes. My bosses got what 1 call 
space paranoia.” 

“Huh?” Gort drew slightly back. 
“What’s that?” 

“They couldn’t cope. Their 
image of mankind didn’t fit them 
to meet the creatures of our sister 
biocosms. When they encoun- 
tered another intelligence they 
expected to understand it. When 
they couldn’t, their impulse was 
to attack. When nothing fought 
back — when the snakes Just played 
hide-and-seek with their best mis- 
sies — they went paranoid.” 

Gort froze, as if the mouse had 
suddenly become an ugly rat. 

“I believe I can be useful in your 
work here,” Tom added smoothly. 
“Besides, as I told you, I was 
anxious to see my brother and my 
son. How about it, sir?” 

XHI 

G ort ruled at last that Tom 
would remain in custody while 
his case was under review, but 
Thorsen gave him leave next 
morning to see the children. I rode 
with him in a security car down to 
the lab. Nick and Kyrie ran out of 
the darkroom to greet him with a 
warmth that surprised me. 

“Guy’s father!” Kyrie hugged 
him eagerly. “I’m so glad you’re 
here. Poor dear Guy will surely be 
happier now. 



114 



GALAXY 




Nick shook his hand politely. 
“Please, Mr. Hood. Tell us 
about your work with the moon 
grit.” His voice quivered with in- 
terest. “Carolina says you’ve 
learned new uses for it.” 

“We put together two second- 
stage tetrahedrons.” Tom paused 
to study Nick the way he used to 
study me when we played chess. 
“They were too weak to project a 
readable record, but we found a 
linkage between them nobody 
had expected. They turned out to 
be remarkable signal devices.” 
“That’s no good to us.” Disap- 
pointment erased Kyrie’s eager 
smile. “We’ve only one nexode — ” 
Her breath caught. She and 
Nick stared at one another, eyes 
black and wide. Bright hope flowed 
back into her face. Nick turned 
abruptly back to Tom. 

“Do you think other messenger 
missiles have reached the solar sys- 
tem?” His breathless voice was al- 
most too fast for me to follow. 
“Do you think the other biocosms 
may have assembled nexodes of 
their own? Or do you think — ” 
emotion froze him for an in- 
stant — “our nexode might have 
power enough to reach the people 
of other stars?” 

Tom gestured with the fluent as- 
surance of some bazaar merchant 
proclaiming the unutterable 
worth of a smuggled emerald. 

“I bring you these questions,” he 
said, “and others equally exciting. 
I hope to help you answer 



them — with General Thorsen’s 
permission.” 

They took him into the dark- 
room, where the nexode was. He 
spent three hours there. The wait- 
ing security men grew restive and 
finally sent Carolina in to learn 
what they were doing. 

She found the lights on. Nick 
and Kyrie were seated on the floor, 
face to face. Nick holding the 
pyramid in his two hands and 
Kyrie leaning over it, her brown 
fingers touching and stroking the 
bright triangles of its patterned 
faces as if playing some curious 
musical instrument. 

Tom sat near them on a stool, 
smoking his scented narcorette 
and calling out rhythmic syllables 
that Carolina though were 
numerals and direction-words in 
Mandarin. 

He scowled with annoyance at 
her intrusion, but Nick and Kyrie 
gave her no attention. She 
watched for a few minutes and 
came out to report. The guards 
phoned Major Gort, who bustled 
over to discover what was going 
on. Nodding for us to follow, he 
burst into the darkroom. 

T om objected angrily, but Nick 
and Kyrie didn’t look up until 
Carolina touched them. They 
seemed frightened then. Nick 
clutched the tetrahedron against 
his bare chest. Kyrie turned pale 
and tried to wave us back. 

“What’s all this?” Gort’s hand 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



115 




was on his gun. “What are you up 
to?” 

“I’m only showing them what we 
learned at the Gobi lab.” Tom was 
sullenly plaintive. “A technique 
for operating the crystal. An 
orientation to the operator’s 
brain. A sequence of contact 
points. A rhythm of relaxation 
and attention.” 

Cateyes narrowed, Gort drew 
back from the tetrahedron as if it 
had become a dangerous dog. 
“What does it do,’’ he asked, 
“when you operate it?” 

“That’s what we were trying to 
discover when you stopped us.” 
Gort snorted. “You’ll have to 
tell me more than that if you want 
permission to go on.” 

“Sir.” Nick stood up with the 
prismatic tetrahedron. “The 
nexode is a kind of machine. It 
communicates ideas, but not with 
anything quite like language. It 
uses its own sort of symbolic 
system for grasping reality.” He 
hesitated. “Td like to tell you more 
about it, sir, but the symbols are 
not translatable in any way I think 
you could understand and the 
reality they represent doesn’t fit 
any symbolic system you know. 
Mr. Hood is trying to show us a 
better way to operate the ma- 
chine.” 

“To communicate with what?” 
“So far — just with itself.” Nick’s 
intense black stare dropped back 
to the tetrahedron. “Now I think 
we can read parts of the record that 



we couldn’t before. Mr. Hood 
thinks it might be linked with other 
nexodes, perhaps on other worlds. 
But we have not yet established any 
such contact.” 

Gort’s greenish eyes blinked 
sleepily. 

“Come along. Hood,” his raspy 
whisper came at last. “I want to 
check with the general before you 
go any farther.” He swung lazily to 
Nick and Kyrie. “Any attempt to 
use that object for communica- 
tion with anything at all will have 
to be cleared with General Thor- 
sen in advance. Do you under- 
stand?” 

“Yes, sir.” Nick glanced quickly 
at Kyrie. “We understand.” 

Grumbling under his breath, 
Tom left with Gort. Nick and Ky- 
rie hurried back into the dark- 
room. Guy had been asleep for 
sixty hours, but he woke that after- 
noon. When he wandered into my 
office I called Gort and got per- 
mission for him to visit Tom. 

A SECURITY car took us to the 
old Sino-Soviet residence. 
Tom’s guards brought him down 
to meet us in a big room which 
the departing delegates had strip- 
ped of everything movable. 

“So you’re Guy! My son — ” 

Tom was waddling eagerly to 
meet him, fat hands reaching out, 
but he stopped with a gasp when 
Guy bounded toward him like a 
bear masquerading as a man. Be- 
fore he could run he was crushed in 



116 



GALAXY 




Guy’s embrace. His breath came 
out in a frightened grunt. 

“Father! Father!” Guy’s slow 
voice was thick and strange with 
surging emotion. “I thought you 
would never come.” 

Tom squirmed with terror until 
Guy’s arms opened. He tried to es- 
cape then, but Guy still held him 
with one great paw, stroking him 
eagerly with the other, whimper- 
ing like some tormented beast. 
Tom wheezed for breath and of- 
fered Guy a trembling hand. Soon 
they were famous friends. 

For tne next three days they were 
never apart. They walked on the 
mesa, worked out together in the 
gym and lounged in the nursery. 
The guards tried to protest when 
Guy followed Tom back to his 
room at night, but his rumbling 
growls persuaded them to let him 
stay. 

Each day Guy came by the of- 
fice and picked me up, with an air 
of apology for putting his father 
first. I watched them together, 
astonished by his emotion and 
searching for Tom’s intention. 
Later security let me listen to the 
tapes of their talk in Tom’s bugged 
room. 

Guy’s role was doglike adora- 
tion. After lonely years, he had 
found his father. He sat for hour 
after hour, great yellow eyes 
fastened on Tom, begging for ev- 
ery detail of his life and Robin’s. 

Tom’s tales amused me. Though 
the truth should have been suf- 



ficient, he made Gamal Hodian a 
martyred saint, our mother a 
comic peasant, Robin a wild nym- 
phomaniac. In his' stories of the 
moon and the stud farm under the 
Gobi he made such an unlikely 
hero of himself that one day I 
warned Guy of his gift for fiction. 

“Don’t lose your cool. Uncle 
Kim.” He winked a tawny eye. “1 
know what isn’t true. I’m only 
helping my Dad play his little 
joke on security.” 

I failed to guess the nature of 
that little joke — even the next day 
when Guy had a distressing en- 
counter with Nick and Kyrie. He 
and Tom had stopped for me. As 
we were strolling past the lab on 
our way toward the gym, Tom be- 
gan asking Guy how he had been 
able to build the great tetrahedron 
out of the grit. The questions wor- 
ried Guy. 

“I don’t — don’t remember.” 
His slow voice thickened, and he 
stopped on the sidewalk outside 
the lab. His gray ears flared. A low 
growl rattled in his throat. 

“But come,” he rumbled sud- 
denly. “I’ll show you.” 

He darted into the lab. Tom gave 
me a searching look and ran after 
him. The security men shouted and 
fired a warning shot, but Guy was 
already gone. I followed them in- 
to the building. 

The tetrahedron lay blazing on 
the darkroom floor. Guy crouched 
over it, whining as if hurt. Nick 
was backing away, fingering a long 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



117 




red mark where a point of the 
crystal must have raked his naked 
chest. Kyrie fluttered between 
Nick and Guy, white with terror 
and dismay. Tom stood in the 
doorway, gesticulating with his 
reeking narcorette and trying glib- 
ly to talk the tension down, imi- 
tating our father’s Turko-Yiddish 
accent to retell a peasant fable 
about three thieves and a stolen 
goat. 

“Come along. Hood!” One of 
the security men jabbed a gun at 
him. “You’re in real trouble 
now — ” 

Guy’s gorilla roar paralyzed me. 
In a blur of motion, he reached 
past Tom, snatched the guard’s 
arm, hauled him into the dark- 
room. When the roar died, the 
guard lay flat on the floor and Guy 
was snapping the stock off his gun 
as if it had been a candy toy. The 
other man had gone for help. 

“Easy, now — ” Tom had to 
wheeze for his own breath. “Let’s 
get the goat back in the bag.” He 
waved the narcorette and grinned 
at me. “How about it, Kimmie? 
Are you old Thorsen’s stoolie? Or 
will you take a chance?” 

I didn’t know what he meant. 

“Once a schlemiel — ” He 
shrugged and turned to Nick and 
Kyrie. “How about you kids? You 
want to die for good old Gort? Or 
try your luck with us?” 

“Our mission is to build the 
tachyon terminal.” Nick caught 
Kyrie’s pale hand and they faced 



Tom steadily. “We won’t let any- 
thing stop us. But I’m afraid you 
can’t help us, Mr. Hood.” 

S irens were screaming outside 
by then. Gort came catfooting 
down the hall, the alert squad be- 
hind him. He handcuffed Tom, 
scooped up the tetrahedron and 
herded us all outside to wait for 
Thorsen, who was just pulling up 
in his staff car. 

“Erik!” Tom grinned and 
started toward the car, holding up 
his cuffed wrists. “I’m glad you got 
here. Your people are about to 
muck us up. Let me explain — ” 
“Stand back. Hood.” Savagely 
angry and visibly ill, Thorsen 
beckoned Gort to the car. “Hold 
this man under double guard,” he 
rapped. “Check out your notion 
that he’s spying for our space 
enemies. Charge him with trea- 
son.” 

“My friend!” Tom whined bit- 
terly. “My old moon compan- 
ion — ” 

“Lock that up in the head- 
quarters safe.” Thorsen’s bony, 
bloodless hand trembled toward 
the tetrahedron. “Nobody is to 
touch it without written per- 
mission from me.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You kids.” Thorsen’s dull 
stare swept Nick and Kyrie. 
“You’ve played too many games. I 
want your beer-can drive developed 
into a missile propulsion system. 
Beginning tomorrow.” 



118 



GALAXY 




“Father!” Kyrie pointed at the 
long red scar across Nick’s ribs. 
“Don’t you see he’s hurt?” 

“Tape him up,” Thorsen 
snapped. “Shop space will be pro- 
vided. You can requisition what 
you need. But you’ll be working 
under guard and without that 
lump of moon grit.” 

Standing hand in hand, tanning 
slowly in the sunlight, they said 
nothing. Thorsen barked at his 
driver and the staff car departed. 
Gort licked his lips and prodded 
Tom into his own car. Guy 
growled and started after him. 

“No, Guy,” Kyrie whispered. 
“They’d only kill you.” 

Guy whimpered and blundered 
away alone. I walked with Nick 
and Kyrie back to the nursery. 
Silent and despondent, they re- 
fused a meal Carolina heated for 
them in the kitchen and soon 
slipped away to sleep. 

A space snake buzzed the mesa 
that night. I didn’t see it. 1 was 
reading a novel in bed, trying not 
to think about the children and the 
terminal. 1 heard its screaming 
passage, felt the bone-deep chill of 
heat drained away, gulped at the 
bitter aftertaste in my mouth. 
The windows rattled. My reading 
lamp flickered and went out. 

I ran to the door barefoot. Out- 
side was black confusion. Auto- 
mobiles had died. Men were 
cursing and running in the dark. 
Here and there a flashlight flick- 
ered. Random gunshots rattled. 



Powerline transformers had 
gone out and the mesa was dark for 
an hour. When the lights came on I 
went down to the nursery. Nick 
and Kyrie were sleeping undis- 
turbed. 1 talked to a security man 
who had seen the diving snake. 

“It wasn’t like the pictures,” he 
said. “You couldn’t see the shape 
in the dark. Just that jagged crystal 
in the heart of it. And the plumes 
reaching out like blue wings.” He 
shivered. “Just one glimpse as it 
roared overhead — and nearly 
froze me to death.” 

I returned to bed without look- 
ing into Guy’s room. Marko woke 
me early next morning, breathless 
with the news. Guy was gone, along 
with Tom and the tetrahedron. 

“Tom’s guards were knocked 
out and expertly tied up,” he said. 
“The headquarters safe was left 
standing open. Nobody knows 
how they got off the mesa. Gort 
thinks it all happened during the 
blackout.” He gave me a troubled 
stare. “1 don’t know what your 
brother is up to, Kim. I suppose 
you don’t. But Gort thinks he’s 
working with the snakes.” 



PERPLEXITY 

XIV 

A SECURITY car came for me 
before Marko left. I was held 
three days in a bare room in the 
old Sino-Soviet residence, while 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



119 




relays of men with tape recorders 
probed for facts I didn’t know 
about Tom and Guy. Gort joined 
them on the last day. 

“Mr. Hodian, your brother was 
heard inviting you and Nick and 
Kyrie to try your luck with him. He 
called you a schlemiel when you 
said no, remember?” His sleepy 
eyes searched me. “You’ll have to 
explain what he wanted.” 

But I couldn’t explain Tom’s 
proposition. 1 didn’t know why the 
snake had come to buzz Skygate 
on that particular night. I couldn’t 
tell him how the headquarters safe 
had been opened. Or how Tom and 
Guy had left the mesa with the tet- 
rahedron. 

“Better talk,” his hoarse whisper 
warned me. “Before we have to try^ 
the biochemical confessors.” 

I was sick with dread of a new 
ordeal the next morning. Gort’s 
men took me to the headquarters 
building, but there were no bio- 
chemicals. Thorsen, instead, came 
shuffling to meet me at his office 
door, looking white and feeble and 
vaguely apologetic. 

“Hodian, we’re desperate.” He 
gave me his unsteady hand. “I 
don’t suppose you know that 
patches of that queer sea fog have 
begun drifting over the west coast 
of Mexico. It comes in at night and 
drifts back to sea when the sun 
comes up. It has covered two or 
three fishing resorts. When it goes 
out the towns are empty. People, 
animals and even fish-bait — gone. 



Nobody knows what sort of things 
are in the fog — or where they mean 
to stop.” 

He tottered back to his desk and 
nodded for me to sit. 

“We believe they’re invaders — 
intruders from another biocosm. 
From Venus or more likely Mer- 
cury. We have evidence they’re al- 
lied with the snakes. We suspect 
that your brother has been in con- 
tact with them — using assemblies 
of the moon grit for communica- 
tion. That’s why we’ve questioned 
you.” 

Slumped behind the desk, he 
paused as if to collect his wasted 
vitality. 

“You’re our best lead, Hodian. 
You’re Hood’s brother and Guy’s 
special friend.” 

His shaking arm made a helpless 
gesture. “I hope you’ll give us any 
help you can.” 

When I said again that I couldn’t 
help, he merely shrugged and 
stared, with no more threats. 1 sat 
wondering whether this new mild- 
ness reflected Suzie’s kindness. 
She had stayed on at Skygate 
through the years he was away, 
keeping busy in the nursery or the 
lab, sometimes joining our small 
social affairs but firmly declin- 
ing dates, returning my open ad- 
miration with nothing more than 
friendship. She was back with 
Thorsen now, cheerfully patient 
with his new infirmities, tending 
him as faithfully as if he had been 
another moon child.

( RETURNED to the nursery 
when he let me go. Kyrie was 
just awakening from the longest 
sleep of her life. I sat with her in 
the kitchen while she picked dully 
at a breakfast tray. She looked so 
bad, so pale and pinched, that I 
had to ask what the trouble was. 

“Uncle Kim, I had a dream.” 
She pushed the food away. “I don’t 
dream much, but this — it was aw- 
ful. About Nick and Guy. About 
the nexode and the terminal.” She 
shivered. “It’s too bad to tell you.” 
That was all she would say. 1 
went with her to look for Nick. We 
had to wait for Gort’s permission, 
but at last a security car took us 
out to an isolated building near the 
end of the strip, beyond the space- 
plane hangars. Once a quaran- 
tine station for returning space- 
men, it was now Nick’s shop. 

Guards at the door called Gort 
before they would let us in. We 
found Nick with Ken McAble and 
two or three of his space engineers 
around a drafting table in a big 
windowless room. He kissed Kyrie 
tenderly and gravely shook my 
hand. 

“We’re supposed to be design- 
ing what the general calls my beer- 
can drive,” he said. “But we’ve got 
problems.” 

One long wall was lined with 
computer-driven metal-shaping 
machines that McAble had requi- 
sitioned from the spaceplane hang- 
ars. Benches were cluttered with 
parts and half-completed models. 



all finished with far more care than 
Nick’s first flying plank. 

The big problems, he said, were 
assembly and control. When Nick 
had assembled and adjusted a unit, 
it somehow transformed any sort 
of radiation into kinetic energy, 
drinking up heat and screaming 
away until it hit something or went 
out of sight. When anybody else 
put one together, nothing happened 
at all. 

“The gadget makes no sense to 
me.” McAble had worked twice 
around the clock with Nick; he was 
bearded and hollow-eyed. “It vio- 
lates Newton, acting without a re- 
action. It breaks the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics, decreasing 
entropy. Running energy uphill!” 
His tired "eyes glared at Nick. “Can 
you account for that?” 

“Newton didn’t know all about 
the universe.” Nick sat cross- 
legged on the table, child-small and 
naked to the waist but patient 
and grave as another Einstein. 
“Neither did Kelvin or Planck. 
Their laws are true for the cases 
they were able to observe. But 
somewhere in spacetime, energy 
did run uphill, increasing entropy 
to make the matter we know. 
Otherwise our universe would not 
exist.” 

McAble bent groggily over the 
drawings again, asking about sym- 
bols that Nick seemed unable to 
explain. I watched for a few min- 
utes without understanding any- 
thing and went to look for Kyrie. I

found her in Nick’s new office, 
huddled down on the floor in a cor- 
ner, silently crying. 

“It’s aw-aw-awful. Uncle Kim.’’ 

She didn’t want a tissue or a cup 
of water from the cooler or any- 
thing at all. She wouldn’t even 
smile. 

“We ought to be building the 
terminal before our time runs out. I 
thought the nexode would show us 
a way. I just couldn’t believe poor 
dear Guy would do what he did. 
But now — ’’ her quavering voice 
was almost a wail — “I just don’t 
know.” 

When Thorsen came later to in- 
spect the project, Nick begged him 
to give it up. 

“Please, General! Maybe some- 
thing in the fog doesn’t like peo- 
ple, but we don’t need weapons 
against the snakes. I don’t think 
they mean to harm us.” 

“They cause planes to crash.” 

“Not on purpose, I think,” Nick 
objected. “I doubt they even know 
they’re hurting anybody. I imagine 
the sharing of energy is their way of 
greeting — their plumes always 
glow with a brighter light while 
they’re soaking up heat. Perhaps 
they’re trying to tell us some- 
thing.” 

“Bull!” Thorsen croaked. “Any- 
thing they want to say, I don’t care 
to know. You just give us the drive. 
We’ll decide what snakes to kill.” 
He glared feverishly at me. 
“Come along, Hodian. I want you 
to draft a news story for us. Some- 



thing to blanket the panic. Play 
down the fog and the snakes. Play 
up what we’re doing here.” 

I waited to learn what that was. 
“We’re coordinating all con- 
tacts with our neighbor biocosms. 
We’re analyzing all the data from 
space and planning a well-bal- 
anced program of energetic ac- 
tion. We intend to keep on top of 
the situation. There’s no cause at 
all for public alarm.” 

H e kept me busy for the next 
few weeks, rewriting bad news 
to make it look less alarming. The 
space snakes had diverted or dis- 
abled a salvo of nuclear missiles 
fired at a patch of fog drifting to- 
ward the Golden Gate. A pair of 
scouting submarines were overdue 
and presumed lost beneath an area 
of Atlantic fog. Space snakes were 
reported roosting on the summits 
of Aconcagua and Kilimanjaro. 

I went back to see Nick and Ky- 
rie when I could. To my surprise, 
they were eagerly busy as if they 
believed our press releases. Kyrie 
had learned to operate the com- 
puter console. The machines it con- 
trolled were grinding out intricate 
bits of metal and plastic for Nick 
and the engineers. 

I watched Nick launch two or 
three more flying devices, one no 
longer than a pencil, which had a 
crystal of rock salt for a core. Each 
shrieked out of his fingers and 
vanished into the distance, leaving 
a chill in the air and a black taste in 



122 



GALAXY 




my mouth. But he was still unable 
to translate his description into 
any form the engineers could 
grasp or copy. 

Absorbed in the project, Nick 
and Kyrie stopped coming back to 
the nursery for rest. Carolina made 
Marko move into the living quar- 
ters of the quarantine building to 
look after them. The last time I 
called, two security men stopped 
me at the door and sent Marko out 
to talk to me. He said they were 
asleep. 

McAble overtook me on the 
parking lot as I was leaving. He 
wanted me to Join him at the Sky- 
gate Hudson for a couple of drinks 
and a steak. He needed to talk. 
Keeping up with Nick and Kyrie 
wasn’t easy. One by one, his fellow 
engineers had given up and gone. 
He felt ready to join them. 

“Kim, I’ve got the jitters.’’ He 
caught my arm and clung, as if 
seeking human warmth. “Not just 
from your double-talking press re- 
lease, either.’’ His haunted face 
twitched, trying but failing to grin. 
“It’s something here.” He glanced 
uneasily back toward the angular 
building, stark and black against a 
blood-colored sunset. “Something 
I don’t understand.” 

I waited for him to explain. 

“Something makes sounds — a 
patter or a rustle or a sort of chirp 
behind you.” He patted his pockets 
distractedly. “Something steals lit- 
tle objects — keys and coins and 
pens. Something watches you out 



of the sl\adows and scuttles away 
before you can turn on a light.” 

“Could be packrats.” I tried to 
cheer him up. “This desert’s full of 
them. The building’s been empty 
for years. They could have got into 
the basement. They’re shy and they 
make sounds and they’ll steal 
nearly anything.” 

“Rats?” He shook his head. “1 
don’t think it’s rats.” 

We drank too much that night in 
the hotel bar, talking about the 
mocking promise of a high trans- 
galactic culture, about the fog and 
the snakes, about what might have 
become of Tom and Guy and the 
tetrahedron, about Nick’s impos- 
sible beer-can drive, about pack- 
rats or something in the quaran- 
tine building. Our troubles were 
hard to drown. 

We never got to the dining room. 
The lights went off while we were 
still in the bar. After one feeble 
flicker — when the stand-by plant 
tried to take up the load — they 
stayed off. I waited for the sonic 
boom of another snake flying by 
and sucking up our power, but no 
sound came. We had a few more 
drinks to the end of things, and I 
remember a bellboy with a candle 
putting me to bed. 

McAble shook me awake the 
next morning. My head throbbed 
and my mouth was foul. 1 didn’t 
want to hear what he was saying. 

“Your friend Gort’s on the 
phone. He says get your tail back 
to the mesa. He wants to know why 



THEMOON CHILDREN

the power went off and what 
became of the quarantine building 
and where are Nick and Kyrie.” 

M CABLE drove me home to the 
mesa. We found traffic stack- 
ing up ahead of us outside the main 
gate. Nobody seemed to know 
why, but the guards were turning 
back most of the civilian workers. 
Tight-lipped, grim men searched 
our car and called headquarters 
before they let us through. 

Inside the reservation we found 
tanks standing at all major intersec- 
tions. Troops were stringing 
barbed wire across the lawn and 
piling sandbags around the 
entrance to headquarters. A squad 
of nervous men in combat gear 
were setting up a missile-launcher 
on the parking lot behind the 
building. 

They held us till Gort came 
down, trailed by a stocky Navajo 
security sergfeant. Gort looked as 
bad as I felt — he was sallow- 
skinned and twitchy. His sleepy 
eyes were swollen and his raspy 
voice was coldly hostile, as if he 
blamed us for everything. 

I tried to ask what was wrong. 
“Get in.” He waved at his car. 
“We’ll take a look.” 

The Navajo drove. Gort sat 
tense beside him, peering into each 
cross street as if he expected to see 
an alien invader. The headquarters 
area was crowded with military 
vehicles and men digging in, but 



the road to the spaceport was om- 
inously empty. 

“Something’s out there.” Gort 
gestured abruptly toward the old 
airstrip and the vacant mesa. “It 
cut the power lines last night. It 
demolished the quarantine build- 
ing. It’s still there.” 

“Nick, Kyrie — where are they?” 
Gort twisted to watch a beer can 
glinting in the weeds as if he ex- 
pected it to take off for Jupiter. 
When we were safely beyond it he 
muttered at the Navajo. 

“Tell ’em, Harry. Tell ’em what 
happened to you.” 

The name on the Navajo’s badge 
was Harry Horse. In an awkward 
mixture of bad English and worse 
Spanish he said he and Corporal 
Miraflores had come out in the 
night to relieve the two men on 
duty at the quarantine building. 

He couldn’t say what the time 
was, because all electric clocks and 
electric watches had stopped, but 
the lights were still out everywhere 
and day had not come when they 
pulled into the parking lot. 

For Dios! It was an unlucky 
night. In the sweep of the head- 
lamps, as the car turned, he saw 
that the quarantine building had 
fallen in. Flattened. Like a paper 
box under the cleats of a tank. 

Leaving the headlamps on, he 
and Miraflores got out of the car to 
investigate. The building had been 
mostly steel. Scraps of metal and 
broken brick still cluttered the site. 
In the rubble — 



124 



GALAXY 




ERGEANT HORSE was driv- 
ing slower now, watching every 
weed along the road. Something 
had been swarming in the rubble of 
the fallen building. Ratones? Ara- 
nas grandes? Quien sabe? 

Rats, maybe. Great spiders. He 
couldn’t say, because the creatures 
scuttled cunningly out of the light. 
Yet he and Miraflores could hear 
them working on the metal. They 
made a sort of humming whine, 
like many small machines. He tried 
to imitate it. 

Damn! He found the English ex- 
pletive. The lights of their car went 
out behind them while they 
watched. The creatures were eat- 
ing the car! He and Miraflores 
ran back to the airstrip, but noth- 
ing chased them. Daylight was 
coming now and they ventured 
back near enough to watch the 
somethings consuming the car. 

The light was not yet good, but 
he said los demonios looked like 
ants swarming over a dead lizard. 
They came along one path and 
took bits of the car away along 
another. Metal, tires, glass. Soon 
there was only the engine block and 
the naked frame, like the bones of 
the car. The last scrap was gone 
before the sun came up. Toda la 
mdquina. 

He wanted Miraflores to report 
the creatures while he stayed to ob- 
serve what they did, but Mira- 
flores was afraid Major Gort 
would not believe him. Bichos — 
bugs eating a car! They ran all the 



way back to the security center. 

“Well, Hodian?” Gort turned to 
glare back at me. “What do you 
make of that?” 

Without much to say I looked at 
McAble. 

“Major, we’ve had some- 
thing — ” He stopped with a gasp 
when a dove flew up beside the car. 
“Something in the building. I was 
telling Mr. Hodian last night. 
Nothing I really ever saw. Some- 
thing scuttling about behind me 
and stealing metal objects. Mr. 
Hodian said it was a packrat.” 

“A pack — a pack — ’’ Gort 
wheezed and twitched and finally 
broke into a stifled laugh, while 
Harry Horse drove stolidly on. “So 
Hodian said it was just a pack- 
rat!” He gulped and wiped his eyes. 
“I wish to God it were just a rat!” 

Abruptly, with a Navajo grunt, 
Harry Horse hit the brake. Tires 
squealed. The car lurched and 
stopped. Harry leaned out, point- 
ing. 

“God!” Gort breathed. “Look at 
the varmint. Flying!” 

It dropped out of the sky ahead 
of us. A queer insect flying with a 
piece of string. It looked larger 
when it struck the pavement, at 
least a foot long. The string was a 
ten-foot section of stolen power 
cable, which perhaps had been too 
heavy for it. 

For a few seconds it lay still, not 
a dozen yards from us. Ant-shaped, 
it had three segments. The head 
segment was silver-colored metal. 



THEAAOON CHILDREN 



125 




a bright eyeless hexagon. The thin- 
ner center segment sprouted dark 
stubby wings and a cluster of limbs 
like silver wire. The tail segment 
was a slick black ball. 

“C/n hormiga!" whispered 
Harry Horse, “t/n hormiga de 
maquinaria!” 

A mechanical ant! Moving now, 
it lifted and turned its blank metal 
head as if watching us. A single del- 
icate bright antenna uncoiled above 
its middle section, curving alertly 
toward us. After a moment it 
darted back to the bit of cable, 
caught it with clustered limbs, 
dragged it off the road. Its tail seg- 
ment turned white as it disap- 
peared into the weeds. 

“Did you see that?” McAble 
glanced at me and watched the 
weeds again. “The way it moved? 
And that white flash?” 

■ “1 saw it,” Gort snapped. “So 
what?” 

“It doesn’t run,” McAble said. 
“It flies — even on the ground. The 
limbs aren’t legs. They’re manip- 
ulators. The wings don’t beat. 
They’re probably just for balance 
and control.” 

“So what?” Gort repeated. 

“Did you see. the frost on its 
tail?” McAble asked. “I think it’s 
kin to the space snakes. I think it 
flies with something like Nick’s 
beer-can drive.” 

“I dor” give a nit how it flies.” 
Gort’s hea y-lidded eyes glared ac- 
cusingly at me, as if he thought I 
had invited these invaders. “Ho- 



dian, what are the things? What are 
they up to here?” 

“How — ” My dry throat made 
only a croak. Then I managed: 
“How could 1 know. Major?” 

A ll the reports of that ominous 
■fog and the invading snakes had 
been disturbing enough, but they 
were still remote. This ant-shaped 
thing was here, as strange as they 
and probably still watching us 
blindly out of the weeds. A sense of 
creeping terror numbed me. 

“Drive on,” Gort told the Nav- 
ajo. 

“Nick and Kyrie were in the 
building.” That recollection struck 
me like a club. “Yuri and Caro- 
lina, too. What’s become of them?” 
“Dead,” Harry Horse muttered 
solemnly. “Killed when house fall 
in. Duckworth and Wiezell, tam- 
■bien. Six people eaten por las hor- 
migas metdlica." 

“Maybe they got away,” Mc- 
Able said. “The things don’t seem 
vicious.” 

Harry Horse doubted that. He 
and Miraflores had come back in 
another car to scout the perimeter 
and military aircraft had been ov- 
erflown and photographed the 
whole area. They had found only 
weeds and desert brush and el hor- 
miguero de acero. The steel ant 
hill. 

“1 hope to God the kids are 
dead!” Gort grated suddenly. “If 
they’re alive it means they’ve been 
dealing with these invaders.” 



126 



GALAXY 




“Huh?” McAble frowned at 
him. “How do you figure that?” 

“In the first place, Nick and Ky- 
rie aren’t exactly human.” Gort 
spoke with a whispery vehemence. 
“The general says they’ve never 
cared for anything except getting in 
touch with their own space kin. 
Hodian’s brother was showing 
them how to use that tetrahedron 
for a signal device. Who were they 
trying to signal?” His swollen eyes 
glared at me. “Maybe these me- 
chanical ants — if that’s what you 
call ’em!” 

Harry Horse was stopping the 
car near the end of the asterite 
strip. A weathered sign read 
QUARANTINE STATION 
and a side road ran two hundred 
yards toward a mound of brown 
earth where the building had 
stood. 

“Let’s have a look.” With a nod 
at me McAble glanced at Gort. 
“You’ll wait. Major?” 

“Don’t count on us,” Gort 
growled. “If anything happens — 
you asked for it.” 

Not very eagerly, I climbed out 
after McAble. Harry Horse turned 
the car around, ready for a fast get- 
away. McAble was walking to- 
ward that new mound, not looking 
back. I followed him, breathing 
hard. 

The pavement was empty. Our 
feet seemed too loud on it. We 
passed a clump of tall dead weeds 
grown where rain had stood in the 
ditch beside the road. 1 jumped and 



stopped when something rattled 
them, but McAble said it was the 
wind or maybe just a rat. 

I felt sweat trickling down my 
ribs, though the day was not yet 
hot. McAble stopped ahead of me 
to kick at the mounded earth. Still 
dark with dampness, it was packed 
smooth and firm. 

“Three hundred cubic yards of 
excavation.” He swept the mound 
with a calculating eye. “Maybe 
four. Plenty of room for Mr. 
Marko and the others, if they’re 
alive.” 

I followed him up the smooth 
brown slope to a bright flat dome 
that crowned the hill. He made me 
hold a tape while he surveyed it. 
Twenty feet across, with a two-foot 
rise at the center. Six circular 
holes around the rim — the door- 
ways — were sealed with metaj 
plugs. He tried the metal with the 
point of a pocket knife and kneeled 
to put his ear against it. 

“Listen!” 

I caught a faint sharp odor like 
hot sulphur when I bent. The metal 
felt slick and warm. With my ear 
against it, I heard a murmuring 
hum, fainter and pitched higher 
than the sound of bees. When Mc- 
Able tapped one of the plugs with 
the handle of his knife that busy 
whisper ceased for seconds. It 
came back slowly and didn’t stop 
when he tapped again. 

“Nick would know every sort of 
code,” McAble said. “If he’s alive, 
we ought to get an answer.” 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



127 




He kept rattling his knife against 
the metal and listening hopefully, 
but all we heard was that faint 
shrill drone, until Gort began 
honking impatiently for us and a 
military helicopter clattered 
overhead. McAble came reluctant- 
ly away. 

“Move,” Gort barked as we 
came near the car. “The general 
called. He’s setting up a demoli- 
tion raid on the anthill. He wants 
us out of the area.” 

“Demolition?” McAble pro- 
tested. “Is that necessary?” 

“Get in,” Gort rapped. “Quick!” 
At his impatient nod Harry 
Horse pulled away before we had 
time to close the doors. 

“Shouldn’t we wait?” I asked. 
“Suppose our friends are alive in 
that dome? Captives, maybe?” 
“Their tough luck,” Gort 
growled. “The general’s afraid to 
wait.” 

XV 

H e followed Gort through 
the barbed wire and sandbags 
into the headquarters building. 
Thorsen’s appearance shocked me. 
Wasted and shaking, he was a 
walking skeleton, animated now 
with terror. He clutched at Mc- 
Able’s sleeve and asked a few 
hoarse questions about the steel 
anthill. 

“I’ll give you another look,” he 
promised us, “after we’ve blown it 
out of the ground.” He shuffled 



toward the staff officers waiting. 
“The target area is now clear.” His 
quavery voice turned violent. 
“Attack!” he gasped. “We don’t 
know what the invaders are up to 
— but they’ve got to be extermi- 
nated.” 

“Erik,” I tried to protest. “Gen- 
eral Thorsen, your own daughter is 
probably in that dome. Along with 
Nick and the Markos and those 
security men. Captives, maybe. If 
they’re alive you’ll kill them all — ” 

“Hold it, Hodian.” He cut me 
sharply off. “The invaders have ig- 
nored our signals. They are a clear 
threat to the whole Skygate facil- 
ity — perhaps to the human race. I 
refuse to be diverted by anybody. 
Our operation will proceed as 
planned.” 

We watched from the headquar- 
ters roof. Heavy mortars chuffed 
behind us. Shells rained on the 
mesa, raising geysers of yellow 
dust. A spotter craft wheeled over 
the target. 

“Fire ineffectual.” A laserman 
relayed the message to Thorsen. 
“Shells falling on target aren’t ex- 
ploding, sir. We’ve had direct hits 
and near misses. But there is not a 
dent in that dome.” 

Thorsen scowled at McAble and 
me. 

“You surveyed the target,” his 
brittle voice crackled. “Can you 
account for this?” 

“Maybe.” McAble shrugged. 
“We saw frost on one ant’s tail. 
Apparently they soak up energy 



128 



GALAXY 




like the space snakes do. Probably 
they’re de-energizing the fuses of 
shells that come within their 
range.” 

“Then I’ll call in an air strike.” 

“I wouldn’t advise it, sir.” Mc- 
Able squinted shrewdly at the 
wheeling spotter plane. “I see no 
advantage — ” 

Shrill with frustration and fear, 
Thorsen ordered the air strike. 
The aircraft were invisible against 
the dazzle of the sun, their black 
bombs tumbling out of a serene 
and empty-seeming sky. Explo- 
sions winked and dust rose in yel- 
low mushrooms and the mesa 
rumbled with dull thunder. 

“Bombs not effectual, sir,” the 
laserman reported. “Visible explo- 
sions come from wide misses. No 
apparent damage to target.” 

Thorsen called for napalm. 
Three flights of supersonic fighter- 
bombers crashed out of that smi- 
ling sky. Their bombs smeared the 
mesa with long streaks of yellow 
fire — which suddenly turned into 
drifting smoke. 

“Spotter going down!” the las- 
erman shouted. “Contact cut off 
— I don’t know how, sir. But his 
last call indicates napalm not ef- 
fective. Target still intact. Some- 
thing snuffed out the fire, sir.” 

Shaking, Thorsen glared at Mc- 
Able. 

“I think it was that entropy-re- 
versing field,” McAble told him. “I 
believe its range has been in- 
creased. 1 think it put out the fire 



— and caught the spotter, too. I 
think you’re beaten, sir.” 

“You keep thinking,” Thorsen 
snapped. “I’m sending in the 
tanks.” 

The tanks went in, converging 
from three directions. The air 
quivered with their engines. Tracer 
fire streaked out of the golden dust 
that thickened over them. Under 
the rolling dust cloud, their thun- 
der-voices stuttered and died. The 
noise stopped; the dust cleared. 
The tanks stood frozen in a mile- 
wide circle around their goal. 

“Have a look, Hodian.” 

The desert danced and blurred in 
McAble’s binoculars, but at last I 
found the anthill. Dead missiles 
had furrowed the mound of earth, 
but that metal dome showed no 
scar. I found a green-and-gray 
splotched tank tipped into a mis- 
sile crater, dead. Something 
crawled along its level gun. A sil- 
ver-headed insect. 

“Watch out, Hodian!” 

M CABLE caught my arm and 
hauled. The binoculars flew out 
of my hand. Men around me 
gasped and cursed and ran. A type- 
writer dropped out of the air, 
crashing into the roof where I had 
been standing. It rocked and clat- 
tered as a bright-headed ant 
squirmed from beneath it. 

I heard a fine mosquito whine. 
The metal ant climbed over the 
smashed typewriter and darted at 
my knees, flying a foot off the roof. 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



129 




Numb with terror, I couldn’t move. 
It stopped six feet away, hovering 
over the binoculars I had dropped. 
Its eyeless head rose and turned 
alertly. I smelled its hot brimstone 
reek. 

“Back!” Dimly, I heard Gort’s 
whispery shout. “Stand back, you 
fool—” 

Stumbling back, 1 saw men 
drawing guns. 

“All together,” Gort called. 
“Aim for the head. Fire!” 

The sun dimmed and lost its 
heat. A deep unpleasant chill sank 
into my bones. Bitterness coated 
my tongue. Shuddering and ill, I 
waited for the shots, but all I heard 
was an empty clacking. 

“Watch its tail!” McAble 
sounded far away. “Hot with 
sucked-up energy. That’s why we 
feel so cold. And why gun-powder 
fails to burn.” 

Its orange-sized tail segment was 
no longer black, but glowing dimly 
red. It settled toward the bi- 
noculars. Its bright snaky limbs ex- 
plored them, wrapped them, clung. 
Its fine high whine grew louder as 
it rose — and that sulfur scent took 
my breath. 

“Grab it!” Gort shouted. “For a 
specimen.” 

I took one unwilling half-step. 
McAble came plunging past me. 
He crouched, reached — and crum- 
pled like an unstrung puppet. The 
ant shot upward with the binocu- 
lars to vanish over the mesa. 

Behind it the sun shone bright 



and hot. The roof-top crowd stood 
quiet for an instant. A sparrow was 
fluttering overhead, carrying a 
grass blade for its nest. 1 breathed 
again, gratefully — and saw Gort 
reloading and lifting his gun. 
Shattering that brief peace, his 
test shot exploded the sparrow. 

Hysterical voices babbled. Thor- 
sen hobbled into the elevator, half- 
carried by his shouting aides. Mc- 
Able twitched and groaned where 
he had fallen. I helped him stand 
and he stumbled clumsily away, 
rubbing his icy hands together. 

“Hodian.” Gort jogged my arm 
as we waited for the elevator. 
“We’ve got a rush job for you. The 
general wants a news release on 
the ants. Make ’em look harmless. 
Emphasize the fact that they 
aren’t known to have injured any- 
body. Play down our failure to 
damage- them. Don’t connect 
them with the moon children — or 
the snakes or the fog. We’re tak- 
ing adequate action to cope with 
them and the general says they’re 
under control.” 

I WAS sweating at my desk that 
afternoon, still struggling to give 
the story some hint of conviction, 
when Suzie Thorsen knocked and 
slipped timidly into the room. 
“May I please speak to you?” 
Though she had always kept me 
at a certain distance, I still admired 
her dainty charm and her clear- 
eyed joy in the comedy of life and 
even her patient fidelity to Thor-

sen. She wanted to talk about him 
now. 

“Erik’s sick, Kim — and I don’t 
know what to do.’’ She looked 
pinched with worry, her eyes dark- 
rimmed. “The doctors think he has 
some unidentified exoform virus in 
his blood. He can’t sleep and he 
can’t eat and he has such dreadful 
headaches. 1 sometimes think he’s 
not quite sane. He ought to be 
hospitalized, but he won’t give up 
his job.” 

I could say nothing useful. 
Though Thorsen’s sickness had 
been evident to me, he wasn’t like- 
ly to take my advice. All 1 actually 
did was take Suzie over to the nur- 
sery for a cup of coffee. 

Military cargo craft were rum- 
bling across the sky. Down the 
street, men in battle dress were 
loading trucks with files and boxes 
from the exobiology lab. Two sen- 
tries at the nursery door scrutin- 
ized our badges. 

The kitchen inside was quiet, 
however — too quiet, with the chil- 
dren gone. Suzie made coffee. 1 
poured a big slug of Mexican rum 
into mine, but she waved the bot- 
tle away. We sat a long time at 
the table, talking over her prob- 
lems and my own. 

The children had become the 
center of our lives. Involved in 
their long search for themselves, 
suffering with Kyrie in the conflict 
between Nick and Guy, excited by 
their splendid dream of the trans- 
galactic terminal, we had been con- 



tent to forget ourselves. Without 
them now, without Marko and 
Carolina, we both felt lost. 

We needed each other. What we 
said was commonplace. I don’t re- 
call many of the words, but I do 
remember the comfort of her smile 
and the candor of her voice and the 
delightful conviction that she was 
really fond of me. 

We didn’t talk much about the 
ants. Their arrival was a final, un- 
believable blow, so completely 
devastating that I had scarcely felt 
it yet. Trying not to think about 
them, I was pouring myself a sec- 
ond slug of rum when all three 
doors of the kitchen splintered in- 
ward. 

“Hands up, Mr. Hodian!” 

Men stormed in, guns pointing. 
Most of them were Space Force 
regulars, but the leader was one of 
Gort’s lieutenants. He looked 
sweaty and jittery but also some- 
how startled and apologetic. 

“You’re under arrest, sir. Ver- 
bal orders from General Thorsen. 
No charges specified. We’re taking 
you to the security center. You 
aren’t allowed to communicate 
with anybody.” 

Suzie begged them to wait while 
she called her husband, but they 
marched me out while she was on 
the phone. At the security center 
they took me to Gort. He was 
rummaging his office in a harried 
way, dumping drawers on his desk. 

“Okay, Hodian.” His swollen 
eyes glanced once at me. “Here’s 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



131 




the situation. Ants are reported in 
the spaceplane hangars. Thorsen is 
calling in a nuclear strike. We’re 
evacuating Skygate ahead of the 
missiles. I’m escorting you to an- 
other post. Our plane should be 
ready now. The guards will see that 
you don’t talk to anybody.” 

“What — what do you think I’ve 
done?” 

“1 don’t know, Hodian.” His 
savage eyes flashed back to me. 
“Whatever you’ve been up to, I in- 
tend to find it out. We’ve no time 
for any formal charges now. But 
you’re Tom Hood’s brother. 
You’ve been involved in space re- 
search and you’ve been close to all 
the children. You’re our best link 
to the ants.” 

“Believe me. Major. I don’t 
know anything — ” 

He turned his back on me to 
dump another drawer. Our plane 
took off half an hour later. It was 
a big military transport, loaded 
with records from headquarters 
and the exobiology lab. The other 
passengers included McAble, Gort 
and a dozen of his men. 

McAble was beside me in a win- 
dow seat, still shaken and subdued 
from his skirmish with the ants. As 
we climbed 1 caught one glimpse 
of the mesa below ajipping wing — 
the zone of black craters and the 
circle of dead tanks around the un- 
touched dome of the ant hill, which 
glinted in the sun like a lost coin. 

“So Thorsen’s going to throw in 
the nukes.” McAble made a grim 



brown face. “He might as well 
throw in napalm to put out a fire. 
His missiles will be bread-and-but- 
ter for the ants.” 

Nobody had announced our des- 
tination, but the wheeling plane 
turned east. Trying to avoid the 
snakes, we flew cautiously low 
through the mountain passes and 
on across the square-patterned 
brown and green of the plains. Oc- 
casional turbulence began to rock 
us and presently 1 saw the dark 
cloud towers of a weather front 
standing all along the east horizon. 

The turbulence increased. Rags 
of cloud whipped by. We bored in- 
to a blue wall of storm. The plane 
pitched and shivered. Rain streaked 
the window. We turned and climb- 
ed and burst out at last. Above the 
dazzling pillars of white, the sky 
was darkly blue. 

“Uh-oh!” McAble frowned. 
“We’re too high.” 

Not much later, everything grew 
darker. The cloud summits lost 
their dazzle. Fangs of cold sank in- 
to me. My tongue turned bitter. 1 
heard the engines cough and die 
and knew a snake was diving on us. 

XVI 

I WAS numb and shuddering 
from loss of body heat, nearly 
as dead as the plane. Wrapped in 
its eerie quiet, I was barely aware 
of the rushing speed, of Gort’s 
whispery curse, of McAble’s sud- 
den nudge. Turning painfully, stiff 



132 



GALAXY 




as if my tingling skin were already 
ice, I saw the snake. 

A long serpentine shadow, trans- 
parent as black-veined glass. Its 
heart was a jagged crystal mass, 
smoldering with dull inner fire like 
an uncut diamond. Two plumes of 
blue light spread out of the crystal, 
wings of cold fire. Powered with 
our own stolen heat, it swept in 
fast. 

A bright pulse beat in the wide 
blue sprays. Perhaps the creature 
was sending some signal of friend- 
ship or warning. Perhaps it felt 
companionable. Perhaps it simply 
needed our heat. Its alien grace was 
as meaningless to me as the 
bitterness lingering in my mouth. 

The plane nosed down and the 
snake was gone. The snowy clouds 
were dazzling again. I gulped, 
shuddered and got my breath. 
Gort lurched past us toward the 
cockpit, shouting orders at the 
crew, but the engines failed to 
start. 

We spun down through a storm, 
through boiling clouds and batter- 
ing winds, through darkness and 
lightning and jarring thunder, 
through rain and savage hail to a 
rough belly landing. 

I recall jumbled fragments of 
sensation. A vague dark line of 
wind-whipped trees. A ripple of 
blue lightning, illuminating a toy- 
sized train creeping toward a toy 
grain elevator. Ripe wheat beaten 
flat with hail. A jolt, a pitch, a 
dazing blow . 



The time after that crash is still a 
shadowy nightmare in my mem- 
ory. The plane didn’t burn, per- 
haps because the snake had drained 
so much of our heat. I believe Mc- 
Able and Gort both lived- the rec- 
ollection is dim as a dream, but I 
think they came together to visit 
me in the hospital, Gort on 
crutches, McAble with his arm in a 
sling. 

As I try to look back, my own 
survival seems surprising. 1 believe 
I had a brain concussion. For a 
long time I lay in traction, with 
both legs broken. On top of such 
injuries I contracted a severe gam- 
ma-form infection. Perhaps it 
saved my life. 

Dr. Ram Narasimachar was my 
physician. I knew him first as a 
brisk foreign voice, as a hand very 
deft with the needles that went into 
my veins, long before I saw his 
darkly arrogant face. Gort may 
have told him in the beginning that 
I was someone worth saving, but 
his passion was the space diseases. 
The mutant gamma-forms in my 
blood made me a laboratory speci- 
men. 

Living in my own delirium, for a 
long, long time I didn’t care where 
I was or what was happening to 
the planet. Though I must have 
heard talk about the space war, its 
appalling disasters were never quite 
as real as my lurid private dreams 
of the children and the ants. 

A quiet old Dane named Andy 
Elving used to clean my room in 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



133 




the morning. He had been to the 
moon as a systems engineer on the 
seeker craft. Now his wife was 
dead of a space infection and his 
son was gone to the war. He lived 
alone in a small white house we 
could see from my window. He was 
growing roses in his back yard and 
he used to keep a vase of them on 
my window ledge. 

He talked about roses and the 
town. Pitman had been a prosper- 
ous agricultural center. There was 
a militia camp near it now and a 
new munitions factory below it on 
the river. A long way from the 
mountains where the snakes had 
begun to nest and the seas where 
the fog kept spreading, it offered 
all the security he could find. 

Even the ants had never come to 
Pitman, Andy Elving said. Their 
lust was for metal and power. As if 
fed by the nuclear strikes, they had 
scattered at first to Albuquerque 
and Las Alamas and White Sands. 
Later they swarmed unpredictably 
into larger cities, leveling 
everything to build their impreg- 
nable nests. Now, however, they 
were leaving the cities to mine the 
earth itself. With no ore-bodies 
near. Pitman was probably safe. 

A YEAR and a half had passed 
when I began to care about the 
calendar. I started asking questions 
about the moon children. Andy 
Elving remembered reading about 
Guy’s stealing the moon jewel. 
Nick and Kyrie had been killed, he 



thought, in the bombardment of 
the ants at Skygate. But that was 
all he knew. 

Nobody had heard about any 
transgalactic terminal. I began to 
feel that the messenger missile had 
lain on the moon for sixty million 
years for no result at all, that the 
children had been born for nothing. 
I thought we had lost our race to 
stop the chaos of conflicting bio- 
cosms. For a long time 1 didn’t 
even want to recover. 

Andy Elving didn’t like to talk 
about the war. Dr. Narasimachar 
was too sick and self-absorbed by 
now to talk much about anything. 
He had an acute gamma-form in- 
fection, probably picked up from 
me, and he was trying desperately 
to immunize himself with trans- 
fusions of my blood. 

My first real news of the war 
came from other patients, after I 
was well enough to be moved out of 
isolation. Clayton Carter was a 
sunburnt ghost when he came into 
the ward, but his weakness came 
from hardship and exposure, not 
from any space disease. He was out 
of his head at first — maybe most of 
the time — but his unbelievable 
story rekindled my interest in the 
world. 

A veteran Space Force pilot, he 
told me how the mechanics of his 
militia unit had built what he be- 
lieved was the last spaceplane in 
America, out of salvaged wreck- 
age. When it was ready his first test 
flight was a scouting mission across 



134 



GALAXY 




the Rockies. Flying low and fast, 
he hoped to evade the snakes and 
bring back a report on what the 
ants were doing in the Skygate 
area. A diving snake killed his jets 
and forced him down, however, 
somewhere beyond the Rio 
Grande. 

As the spaceplane went down. 
Carter glimpsed something that 
strained his faith in his own sanity. 
Even now he couldn’t quite believe 
what he had seen and I had to coax 
the story from him. He was sitting 
up in bed that day, a black-bearded 
skeleton smeared with chalky oint- 
ments. 1 remember the tortured 
hesitation in his hoarse cattle-coun- 
try drawl — he was a native New 
Mexican. 

“The army don’t believe what 1 
saw — or thought I saw.’’ His in- 
flamed eyes peered uneasily at me. 
“A building on the mesa where 
Skygate was. A kind of tower — 
taller than the Rockies! Call me a 
liar — ’’ 

“Was it white?” I whispered. 
“Was it seven columns in a clus- 
ter? Did the tops of the outer col- 
umns make a kind of spiral stair? 
Did the center column have a 
pointed, shining dome?” 

“Have you — ” He gulped and 
wet his ulcerated lips. “Mister, 
have you been there?” 

W WHAT’S the transgalactic ter- 

^minal!” My voice was as 
rough and breathless as his own. 
“The station the moon children 



were born to build, so the tachyon 
ships could come from the stars.” 
For the first time I tried to sit up in 
bed. “Are you sure it’s really 
there?” 

“It’s there, all right.” Awe 
echoed in his voice. “Taller than 1 
dared fly and shaped exactly like 
you say. “Except — ” He paused to 
frown. “Except for that high dome. 
It wasn’t bright or shining at all. It 
was black as midnight.” 

“Just so it’s there.” I was trying 
to climb out of bed. “Now the 
tachyon ships will come — ” 

“Not for us they won’t.” He 
sank back against the pillows. 
“Because that terminal don’t be- 
long to no friends of ours.” 

I had to wait while a nurse 
sprayed his sadly damaged feet. 
Then he went on with his tantaliz- 
ing story. 

“I was Tom Fool Lucky in a 
way,” he said. “The plane came 
down dead, but the ejection gear 
did kick me out before the crash. 
All I got was a twisted ankle and a 
few cracked ribs. Not bad, con- 
sidering the rocky arroyo 1 came 
down in. 

“I scrabbled around in the 
wreckage, but I never found my 
survival kit. The desert got hot 
and my ankle swelled and 1 began 
to wonder how lucky 1 really was. 
But when I climbed out of the gully 
1 could see that tower. Taller than 
the clouds! 

“I waited till sundown, afraid it 
might be a mirage. But it stayed 



THE MOON CHILDREN

there. The sun blazed on it, long 
after the desert was dark. Mister, it 
was something! Golden up high 
where the sun still struck, with 
zones of red and purple slowly 
climbing out of the night around 
me. I never imagined the towers of 
heaven quite so beautiful. 

“I made a sort of crutch out of 
parts from my ejection shell. When 
dawn came 1 started toward the 
tower. The top of it was already 
blazing before day came, gold and 
rose-colored under that dead black 
dome. 

“It looked about a mile off when 
I set out. I hobbled along till 
sundown and it still looked a mile 
away. By that time my tongue was 
thick and my ankle was killing me 
and the tower didn’t seem so pretty 
any longer. 

“I hadn’t seen a sign of a human 
being anywhere, or even any ani- 
mal bigger than a packrat. I guess 
the fallout from Skygate got most 
of the larger life. It may have been 
still active — I had no meter for it. 
That next day might have been my 
last if I hadn’t stumbled into the 
old Albuquerque road. 

“There wasn’t any traffic. 
Hadn’t been, for a long time. 
Rocks washed into the highway 
dips. One funny thing — all the 
bridges had been taken out. I was 
still sane enough to wonder why. I 
limped on till I came to the old Dos 
Lobos trading post. 

“I used to stop there on vaca- 
tion trips, but 1 barely recognized it 



now. Everything metal was gone. 
Signs and gas pumps and the tin 
roof off the buildings. Even the 
junk cars piled up behind the ga- 
rage. 

“Rain had begun to crumble the 
’dobe walls, but I dug in the dried 
mud with my crutch till 1 un- 
covered a bottle of apple cider. 
That saved my life. 1 sipped and 
slept all night — and dreamed about 
people with golden wings letting 
me into that tower, like old Saint 
Pete admitting the children of God. 

“In the morning I dug again. 
Most of the metal cans were gone 
or rusted through and rain and rats 
had spoiled a lot of the rest, but 1 
found three more cases of cider and 
enough other stuff still good in 
glass and plastic. 

“1 stayed there at the ’dobe 
walls, lying in the shade at noon 
and watching that tower the rest of 
the day, till I could leave the crutch 
and carry a pack. I walked on, 
then, following the old pavement 
and climbing through the dry 
canyons where the bridges were 
missing. 

“A half-moon was out the night 
I came to the mesa. Feeling too 
eager to stop, I climbed the old 
mesa road by moonlight. The 
moon was low when I got to the 
rim — but there it was. 

“The foot of it was still a mile or 
two away, but that black dome was 
lost in the stars. I got a crick in my 
neck, looking up at it. Mister, I 
wish I could tell you how I felt. 



136 



GALAXY 




Crazy with wonder, but somehow 
afraid — ” 

At that point the nurse came 
back. She told Carter he was get- 
ting too tired. Though he pro- 
tested, she turned his pillow and 
lowered his bed and snapped her 
sleeper gun at his head. Next day, 
after his feet were sprayed, I 
begged him to go on. 

ai n’t laughing at me, 
^mister?” He squinted suspic- 
iously through his wild black beard 
and his chalky facial dressings. 
“You don’t think I’m nuts?’’ 

“I knew the moon kids,’’ I as- 
sured him. “1 watched them work- 
ing two years on the plans for that 
terminal, hoping COSMOS would 
build it. I hope — I hope it’s real.’’ 

“It’s plenty real.’’ He punched 
the button to raise his bed and sat 
glaring strangely at me. “But the 
builders ain’t human,” he mutter- 
ed. “They ain’t setting it up for 
us.” 

1 waited uneasily till he went on. 

“They were working overtime 
the night I got there. I couldn’t see 
much, because the moon was near- 
ly down by then. But I could 
hear — ” one bandaged hand made 
a hesitant groping motion — “a 
sort of humming whine like a mil- 
lion dentists drilling. Or a billion 
hives of bees. Then there was a 
kind of booming beat, deep and 
slow, like the biggest drum that 
ever was. 

“I dropped my pack at the mesa 



rim and started toward the tower. 
But 1 didn’t get far. I began to won- 
der why those workers used no 
lights. And why I heard no human 
voices. Then the wind must have 
changed, because I caught an odor 
that choked me. A scent like burn- 
ing sulfur. 

“All that was too much. I picked 
up my pack and scuttled down the 
road to a sort of shallow cave I had 
passed. I crawled in there to hide. 
It was cold, but I couldn’t risk a 
fire. Finally 1 shivered myself to 
sleep. 

“Something woke me about 
sunup. Something crawling on my 
chest. I batted it away before my 
eyes were open. It had a cold met- 
al feel. I heard a whine and smelled 
sulfur and saw it hovering over my 
head. 

“A damn mechanical ant! I’d 
seen news pictures, but still the 
thing shook me up. That blind six- 
sided head, watching me with no 
eyes to watch with. The legs of it 
like a bunch of thin wire snakes — 
coiled around the coins and keys it 
had stolen out of my pocket. Even 
the class ring off my finger! 

“It watched me for maybe half a 
minute before it sailed away with 
the loot. I was sick after it left. 
Lost my supper and what little 
strength I had. But finally, after an 
hour or two, I nerved myself to 
climb back to the rim for another 
look. 

“The tower wasn’t heaven to me 
now.” Carter shivered under his 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



137 




sheet. “It looked more like the gate 
to hell — with all those metal ants 
for junior demons. They were 
swarming as far as I could see, 
swirling like dark clouds all around 
the bottom of the tower. 

“Near me, so close I could see 
their flat bright heads and their 
black tail-balls, they came and 
went from a metal-rimmed pit. In 
one stream they brought materials 
— hundreds of them clinging to a 
rusty ingot or a mass of ore or a 
scrap of junk that might have come 
from my own spaceplane. In 
another stream they came out with 
fabricated parts they carried to the 
tower. Bright metal and big white 
blocks. Their noise shook the rocks 
under me and their hot reek burn- 
ed my eyes. They’re building an 
ant hill — into the stratosphere. 

“Standing there, 1 forgot to be 
frightened, till one of them came 
whining around my head. I was 
afraid it wanted my gold tooth. 
When it flew back to the pit I 
turned and ran. Nothing followed 
me — but I nearly died getting out.” 

Carter sighed as if still ex- 
hausted. 

“I wandered out of the desert 
and over the mountains and all the 
way back. The ants had scavanged 
all the metal everywhere and I nev- 
er saw a human being. Water and 
food were hard to find. After my 
shoes wore out I had to tear up my 
clothes for bandages — that’s how I 
got cooked with the sun. 1 was 
nearly back to Oklahoma when the 



militia scouts picked me up. 

“That’s it, mister.” He sat up, 
glaring fiercely through his chalky 
mask. “The militia don’t believe 
me and I ain’t got no proof. The 
snakes have downed our last air- 
plane. But that tower’s standing 
there where Skygate was. Taller 
than the clouds! I ain’t no liar, 
mister.” 

“I’m sure you aren’t,” I said. 

But suddenly I wasn’t sure. 
Something about his angry chal- 
lenge made me think of Yuri 
Marko, who had once been just as 
positive that he had found a trans- 
galactic terminal on the moon. 

XVII 

W ITH new skin grown on his 
feet, Clayton Carter went back 
to his militia unit. He wanted to 
lead a mounted party west. Neither 
the snakes nor the ants, he thought, 
would interfere with horses. He 
hoped to photograph the terminal 
and perhaps to try communi- 
cating with the ants, but I never 
learned what became of him. 

The next man beside me lay 
three days in a heal-sleep tent. 

“His name’s Ballou,” old Andy 
Hiving told me. “He’s got friends. 
They brought him on a horse cart 
from back east and threatened to 
burn the hospital if Doc Narasi- 
machar wouldn’t take him in ahead 
of the war refugees that are dying 
in the streets.” 

“A space case?” 



138 



GALAXY 




“Some woman carved him up. 
Slashed his face and stabbed him in 
the gut. He came in with peri- 
tonitis and it took some fancy sur- 
gery to save him.” 

Awake, Ballou was an angular 
waspish man with thick dark hair 
and a complaining nasal whine. He 
fumed when the doctor hurt his 
face, peeling off the bandages, and 
demanded a mirror to inspect him- 
self. 

“Look what you’ve done to me!” 
He fingered the forked blue seam 
across his cheek. “I used to be a 
fine-lookin’ man. Folks said 1 
coulda been a trivee star. Now look 
what a fright you’ve made of me.” 
He threw the mirror at the doctor. 
“You clumsy bastard vet!” 

Narasimachar ducked the mir- 
ror, which shattered on the floor. 
My blood had failed to stop the 
gamma-life teeming in his flesh and 
his worsening palsy had in fact 
begun to spoil his surgery. I saw 
the stifled fury on his dark face and 
the way he clutched his gaunt 
hands together to stop their shak- 
ing. He stalked out silently. 

“Call him back,” Ballou snarled 
at the nurse. “I won’t be insulted. 
Not by any pill-pushing quack. I’ll 
have you know I’m somebody. 
We’re the Fairfax Ballous. I guess 
you’ve heard of us.” 

“I’ve heard plenty.” 

The nurse whisked out and he 
turned fretfully to me. 

“I’m Spiro Ballou.” An ingrati- 
ating smile twitched across the un- 



scarred half of his face. “Call me 
Spike. Back in Fairfax, 1 was 
somebody. People didn’t insult me 
there. Not twice!” 

I was about to introduce myself, 
but his plaintive voice ran on, 
quivering with self-pity now. 

“All this crap is hard for me to 
take, because of who I was. My old 
man was president of the Fairfax 
National Bank and chairman 
of the board of Fairball Industries. 
He owned the best half of the town. 
When I married he bought me the 
Poppy-Cola franchise for a 
wedding present. But look at me 
now.” 

He sniffled and fingered his scar. 

“My wife was Billie Fran — the 
sexiest doll in town. 1 had four 
acres out in Faircrest. An eight- 
room home of hand-laid brick. I 
drove a Cadillac Hydrocat and 
traded twice a year. I thought 1 had 
everything till the Moon King 
came along — ” 

“The Moon King?” 1 had been 
thoroughly bored with Spike Bal- 
lou, but that jolted me awake. 
“Who’s the Moon King?” 

“You remember the Moon Kids? 
Two cute little scamps and one like 
a hairy bear? There used to be 
Moon Kid dolls. Moon Kid toys 
and Moon Kid picture books — ” 

I said I remembered the moon

cause space didn’t mean fun and 
games any more, after we got into

the other biocosms. Anyhow, a 
couple of years ago this animal 
type ran off with what he calls the 
moon jewel — ” 

“Have you seen it?” 1 inter- 
rupted him. “A glowing pyra- 
mid — ” 

“Billie Fran saw it.” Rancor 
growed in his throat. “Most of the 
women in Fairfax did. But he nev- 
er showed it to me. He don’t take 
to men.” 

W¥S GUY — ” I caught myself. 
^ “Is this jewel in Fairfax now?” 
“It sure is.” Ballou nodded bit- 
terly. “I hear he stores it in the 
vault of my old man’s bank. Billie 
Fran says it keeps the space things 
out of Fairfax. The killer fog and 
the flying snakes and them iron- 
eating ants. She thinks it cures the 
space diseases.” 

“This moon boy has it?” 

“He ain’t no boy. Big as a 
grizzly. But he come to Fairfax 
with the jewel a couple of years 
ago. About the time the world be- 
gan to fall apart. Only 1 didn’t 
know him then. One that did was 
Billie Fran. My own wife — ” 

Ballou gritted his teeth. 

“That was when she turned cold 
to me. If you can imagine — ” He 
choked with indignation, as if he 
couldn’t imagine. “They were slick 
enough. It was just lately anybody 
found out about ’em. My 
wife — and that hairy beast! They 
should have been buried alive.” 

He sat up in bed, breathing hard 



and glaring at a nurse who had 
stopped to listen at the door until at 
last she sniffed and disappeared. 
He lay back to get his breath. 

“Seems the moon thing come 
into the country with some circus. 
Like the animal freak he is. Billed 
as the Siberian talking bear. One 
night a college professor got to 
asking questions he didn’t like. He 
smashed the guy’s face against the 
bars and broke out of his cage be- 
fore the cops got there. 

“That was off in another town. 
He slipped into Fairfax through the 
woods. Dressed in a floppy hat and 
an old rain cape to make like a 
human hobo, he was working the 
alleys, begging for food. I must 
have been playing gin at the coun- 
try club that day. Anyhow, Billie 
Fran was home alone.” 

Rage seethed in him. 

“I guess she let him into the 
kitchen first. She filled him up with 
a roast and potatoes she’d been 
cooking for me. She never told me 
all they did, but finally she put him 
in the little apartment behind the 
garage, where her old lady stayed 
till she died. She kept him there — 
if you can picture that ! 

“H ow cou Id she do it?” He 
blinked at me, his glaring fury 
clouded with a dim bewilderment. 
“A sweet girl like Billy Fran — 
singing in the Presbyterian choir 
and teaching the toddler’s Sunday 
school class and crying like a baby 
every time she found a spot of lip- 
stick on my shirt. How could any 



140 



GALAXY 




woman love that circus freak? 
When she had me?” 

I didn’t try to answer. 

“She kept him there the best 
part of a year before I ever knew. 
But she wasn’t the only one he 
had.” A sullen amazement slowed 
his voice. “I guess it was the clean- 
ing woman, first. Then her Thurs- 
day bridge luncheon. Then her 
Sunday school class — the young 
married women.” He grimaced 
with a certain bitter smugness. “So 
I wasn’t the only sucker.” 

I couldn’t help asking how he 
found the moon child. 

“Billie was just too damned hap- 
py.” He scowled savagely. “Too 
damned healthy. Too damned 
beautiful. Like she had discovered 
the fountain of life. Her sinusitis 
cleared up. She was singing to her- 
self all the time. Doing little things 
to please me. She tried to cook 
what I liked and she saved out of 
the house allowance to buy a new 
shockproof chronoscope I wanted 
for my birthday. And she quit 
nagging when I come in late. 
Things like that made me wonder, 
but then a stranger tipped me off. 

“A fat black little guy with a 
hook nose and a bad odor. When 
he first come out to the Poppy- 
Cola plant I thought he was a fed- 
eral nark. But it turns out he don’t 
care how we spike the stuff. He’s a 
private eye, hired to find the moon 
jewel.” 

“Huh?” I had begun to wonder 
how my missing brother would fit 



into the picture. “Was his name 
Tom Hood?” 

WI11HE name he gave us was 
i Todhunter Hoke.” Ballou 
peered at me sharply. “He knew all 
about that educated Siberian bear 
and he’d talked to that bunged-up 
college professor. He snooped 
around till he located that moon 
beast and his harem. 

“I saw red when he told me 
about Billie Fran. I tried to hit him, 
but he ducked away and tossed me 
a picture of her and the beast. He’d 
bugged the room, too, and he 
played me a tape that made me 
sick. That beast and Billie Fran 
making love and laughing at 
me!” 

Ballou sat silent for a moment, 
his scarred face dark and twitch- 
ing. 

“Hoke called a bunch of us to- 
gether. My golf and poker buddies 
— that hairy brute had all our 
wives.” His stifled voice was hoarse 
with hate. “I wanted to catch him 
and burn him alive, but Hoke said 
he’d be too hard for us to handle. 

“So finally we called in the law. 
My uncle was the chief of police 
and the county sheriff had a note at 
the bank, so we got cooperation. 
We closed in on that garage apart- 
ment with twenty men in six cars. I 
had buckshot in a pump gun and I 
meant to gut-shoot the beast. But 
he got away.” Ballou writhed with 
frustration. “Somebody yelled 
that he was running into the woods 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



141 




behind the barbecue. We all 
dashed in like fools. Shooting 
started down in the brush by the 
creek, but when we got to the dead 
man he was just a deputy sheriff. 

“That beast had out-foxed us — 
them damfool women musta tipped 
him off. Our cars had been rolled 
over and set on fire before we got 
outa the woods. And all that was 
just for openers — ” 

Perhaps I had smiled, because he 
stopped to glare at me. 

“It ain’t no joke,” he whined 
angrily. “Not to none of us. Nor to 
them women, when our turn 
comes. We’ll make them sluts hate 
the day they ever saw that stinkin’ 
brute.” 

“It’s more than a joke,’’ I 
agreed. “Did you ever catch the 
moon man?” 

“Not yet. Nor many of his crazy 
bitches, either. The sheriff tried to 
round up all the women and get 
’em out of town. He swore us into a 
special posse and sent us up and 
down the streets, but all we caught 
was a handful of little girls and 
smooth-mouthed grannies. All the 
rest was hiding or shooting at us. 

“That hunt went on all day. A 
dozen men was hurt or killed in a 
shootout at the city park. The 
sheriff got hit in an ambush down 
by the bottling plant. A big fire was 
set on Main Street while we were 
outa town. 

“We had ’em surrounded once in 
the Red Raven tavern, out on the 
airport road. The police tossed riot 



bombs into the place and went in 
shooting. But that brute was too 
much for ’em. He breathed the gas 
and took the bullets and used the 
chief like a club to smash his way 
out. A hairy devil! Big as a Brah- 
ma bull. 

“And them women — you can’t 
imagine what he’s done to them! 
Most of ’em pregnant. Blown up 
with their own baby beasts. But 
that don’t slow ’em down. I seen 
the Presbyterian pastor thrown 
outa the tavern through a plate 
glass window by his own young 
daughter. 

“By night they was hunting us. 
Gangs of them hot bitches took the 
court house and the city hall and 
the militia armory. They sniped at 
us from the water tower and the 
elevators and the roof of my old 
man’s bank. They run us out of 
town.” 

Ballou lay back and closed his 
eyes, wheezing for his breath as if 
defeated all over again by the vio- 
lence of his own narrative. 

“Run us out — and kept us out. 
They burned the bridges. Piled up 
wrecked cars for road blocks. 
Posted snipers in trees and silos. 
Them crazy women and their hairy 
stud — that’s why we call him the 
Moon King.” 

“So he’s still there?” 

“The gov’ment ain’t about to 
help us catch him — not when 
they’re busy losing the space war. 
The militia’s been trying to fight a 
patch of killer fog spreading over 



142 



GALAXY 




Lake Ballou. So Hoke helped us 
organize our own mounted patrol. 

“I’m the captain, of course. We 
forded the river early one morning 
and slipped down through the 
woods where the snipers couldn’t 
spot us. We surprised three 
women picking beans in a little 
garden patch. They yelled and ran, 
but we caught one of ’em. 

“Billie Fran — about to bust with 
her own monster-baby. Her second 
kid by him — she never wanted none 
of mine. We took her back to 
camp. She wouldn’t talk at first, 
but she opened up when Hoke got 
hold of her. She told us all about 
that brute and the moon jew- 
el — how they keep it in the bank 
vault while he sleeps once a week, 
two or three days at a time. 

“I felt sorry for her when Hoke 
got through — what a fool I was!” 
Ballou’s quivering fingertips ex- 
plored his scar. “I was guarding 
her that night, in the barn where we 
was camped. Somehow she got 
untied and come at me with a rusty 
old gelding knife she musta found 
under the hay. She cut me up and 
got away on our best horse. 



“That’s how come me here — and 
I like to died on the road. But we 
ain’t through. Hoke’s setting up 
another raid right now, but he’ll 
wait for me to lead it. He’s over- 
hauling a broke-down army tank 
the militia left when they run away 
from the lake. We’re going in with 
that on a day when the Moon 
King’s asleep. I don’t think them 
bitches know how to stop a 
tank — ” 

“Nap time, Mr. Ballou!” 

He glowered at the bustling 
nurse as if she had been one of 
Guy’s girls. Smiling sweetly, she 
smoothed his sheets and read his 
monitors and spread his tent for 
another heal-sleep treatment. 

Three of his commandoes came 
to pick him up when he was dis- 
charged. They were brown sullen 
men, bristling with knives and 
guns. The tank had been checked 
out, one of them said, and Hoke 
was figuring the days when the 
Moon King would be asleep. If the 
hairy bastard ever woke up, he’d 
learn he’d lost his marbles.

P OSSIBLY I’ve lived too much. 

Possibly 1 only think I have. But 
whichever it is, less and less am I able 
to believe in mass fiction as a vehicle 
of use-ready social ideas. In the arena 
of contending social values, there are 
sharper lances. Where fiction has 
sparked immediate social action, 
as with the young Upton Sinclair, it 
has more closely resembled docu- 
mentation. Even then, its effect 
seems to be in inverse proportion to 
the size of its target. Even so, we have 
polluters and exploiters with us yet, 
long after Sinclair turned to Lanny 
Budd for solace. The basic system, 
some few of whose gallery of symp- 
toms drew Sinclair’s ire, persists. 

The value of science fiction — a phil- 
osophical, speculative vehicle by 
definition — cannot be even as im- 
mediately effective as that of the 
muckraking contemporary roman a 
clef. Science fiction is almost ines- 
capably a vehicle for ideas whose 
time has not come. 

This doesn’t and shouldn’t prevent 
people from trying to make some- 
thing else of it. Inevitably, one of 
them will find a way. But it does make 
the odds quite heavy against any given 
individual’s success in producing 
anything socially deeper than what 



we already know. And unfortunate- 
ly we are beset with people who sin- 
cerely believe that to say anything 
above the conventional level of medi- 
ocrity is to explore territory never be- 
fore beheld by man or artist. These ap- 
pear to be people who have not yet re- 
alized that conventional mediocrity 
is a proven effective survival mech- 
anism for the individual, if not for the 
mass, and quite often a consciously 
thought and devotedly cultivated 
mechanism which no trumpery con- 
coction of the tale-teller’s art can 
hope to disarm. It is to be remem- 
bered that the itinerant unthreaded- 
pipe salesman knows he has seen a 
good deal more of the world than the 
garret genius. It is to be considered 
that if he has scales on his eyes, per- 
haps it is because of the scars on his 
back, and elsewhere. 

Now, I may be wrong. But more and 
more do I feel that our bigger thinkers 
are whistling up their spouts, and I 
think perhaps 1 know why. More and 
more often as I accumulate abra- 
sions in the course of nurturing mine 
own torch amidst the nighted pali- 
sades of life do I crave a plain tale 
plainly told. I do my own damned ex- 
pert agonizing. What I need from a 
storyteller is some convincing hint 
that it’s not all for nothing. 

The interesting thing about a well- 
told story for adults is that it requires 
more experience of life, and more 
closely observed experience, than 
do the comparatively easy “heavy” 
novels whose frequent nature as a 
formless outcry of one undistin- 
guished ego is disguised behind a 
hastily worked screen of experimental 
technique or a dull mask of delib- 
erate pedestrianism. 

Eull appreciation of a hero’s hard 



144 




knocks requires a battered context of 
one’s own. The Maltese Falcon will 
not work on an innocent reader. 
Neither will Nerves nor The Invisible 
Man. Some approximation of them 
will work on children — it’s possible to 
make Universal movies of all of 
them. But it would shake you to your 
innocent boots what John Huston 
could have done with H.G. Wells if he 
hadn’t found Dashiell Hammett first. 
The stuff is there, and it is not for chil- 
dren. Not children only, at any rate. 

And that brings me to this column’s 
books. None of them are destined for 
immortality. None is without flaw. 
But it was reading them, and enjoy- 
ing some of their passages immoder- 
ately, that led me to wonder what is 
wrong, that Keith Laumer should 
please me more than Tom Disch. I 
reached the conclusion that perhaps 
there is more to it than simple right 
and wrong. 

L AUMER’S The Other Side of 
Time (Walker & Co., $4.95), for in- 
stance, is nothing but an adventure 
story set in his parallel-universe se- 
ries, in which Brion Bayard — a figure 
straight out of John Buchan — strives to 
prevent the Zero-Zero universe from 
being snuffed out. The vehicle of ex- 
tinction in this case is a shambling 
race of beastmen called the Hagroon 
who — unlikely though it sounds — 
have access to the same scientific 
principles which enable the Zero- 
Zero Imperium to operate across al- 
ternate timetracks. To defeat them, 
Bayard must first ally himself with 
yet another timetracking race from a 
universe in which the ancestors of 
Homo Sapiens did not win out over 
the other simians, then must home- 
build an orangecrate vehicle after be- 



ing marooned in a technologically 
backward universe. 

Incidental to all this, he also dis- 
covers, or, rather, blunders into, gen- 
uine time travel, plus a curious zero- 
time “in between’’ condition which 
Laumer never does quite rationalize. 

This we call piling Pelion on Ossa, 
painting the lily and throwing in the 
kitchen sink. Just as Brion Bayard 
becomes a helpless victim of cir- 
cumstances throughout much of this 
narrative, so does Laumer, in trying 
to make the story work out so that it 
sustains excitement and teems with 
individually attractive scenes, find 
himself having to make his sincere, 
courageous hero an impulsive dolt. 

In addition, Bayard’s escape from 
his marooning specifically depends 
on the supposition that the two hu- 
man discoverers of the time-tracking 
principle must have existed, and at 
least done some preliminary tinker- 
ing, even in a 20th Century ruled by 
Napoleon the Fifth in his best 19th 
Century manner. It’s then bad log- 
ical structure to confer time-tracking 
on the Hagroon and on the non-hu- 
man simians of Xonijeel. On the one 
hand, you are using exclusivity as a 
rationale; on the other, you are pro- 
moting universality. 

BUT, although 1 can’t say you won’t 
notice this, or care, while reading the 
book, the inescapable fact is that the 
thing is fun to read. On the one level, 
there’s the old “How’s he going to get 
out of this one?” syndrome to keep 
you turning the pages. On a perhaps 
deeper level, there’s a recognition of 
the fact that the hero has a realistic 
problem. Bayard’s true adversaries 
are not the Hagroon; they’re a com- 
paratively simple business to deal 
with; all you have to do is swing a big 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



145 




enough gun into position. That’s a 
purely executive matter. But what 
gums up the gears is the interference 
of the sincere, noble, enlightened sim- 
ians, who would like to see an orderly, 
peaceful universe — based of course 
on their own zero-zero coordinates. 
That is called E>ealing With Manage- 
ment, and let me tell you, Laumer 
makes it poignant. 

You will notice this is not a Big 
Think. But is something many of us 
can identify with. For most of us, per- 
sonal experience with external and 
domestic politics is limited. Urban 
renewal, equal opportunity, pollu- 
tion, overpopulation, and Amtrak 
are not things we grapple with. We 
grapple with people whose actions 
thwart us, whatever they may say or 
believe. We grapple with city em- 
ployees who’d rather see us throw the 
bundled newspaper into the incin- 
erator than stick it in the recycling 
collection bin. We all want to get rid 
of the garbage, but how about the tax- 
paid refuse yard man who deliberate- 
ly breaks your turned-in glass under 
the tires of your truck? 

All right, so his desire to have the 
yard run in its God-intended age-long 
manner outweighs his desire to live 
on a clean earth. Is there that much dif- 
ference between his desire to do 
things his way and my desire to do 
things mine? 

It’s the collision between these iden- 
tical traits that breaks the glass — and 
it’s this level of problem that the ad- 
venture tale deals with. Committees 
for The Good don’t punch each other 
on the nose; people do. And it’s peo- 
ple who wince away from the next up- 
raised fist and who, even in the midst of 
not listening to some chairman’s 
drone, find their minds drifting back 

4 



to some thirty-years-past schoolyard 
confrontation and sit upright. 

Am I getting too far afield, and in- 
vesting too much importance in a 
piece of thud-and-blunder? Perhaps. 
But why has the action story always 
been with us? Surely, you’d think 
grown people wouldn’t be interested 
in what appears to be a totally childish 
form. 

Let’s take a look at Tactics of Mis- 
take, by Gordon R. Dickson (Double- 
day, $4.95). (It’s all $4.95 these days. 
No wonder they have to dump them as 
soon as they’re in the stores). 

Tactics of Mistake is tangential to 
Dickson’s Dorsai series. In it, Cletus 
Grahame — a light colonel, as distin- 
guished from Brion Bayard, who’s a 
full bird — lays down one card after an- 
other in a sequence demonstrating 
that By God a junior executive can 

(A) outperform Management and 

(B) start his own wildly successful 
company. In a Dorsai novel, where 
war is treated as business, the an- 
alogy’s not far-fetched at all. 

Superficially Grahame follows out 
that story which Randall Garrett says 
begins with: 

“You’ll find things are a lot dif- 
ferent out here. Lieutenant,’’ and 
ends with “I guess I must have mis- 
judged you, sir.” 

Resigning his instructor’s post at the 
Western Alliance Military Academy, 
Grahame gets himself assigned as a 
tactical specialist on an obscure lit- 
tle world where they seem to be fight- 
ing the Indochina war all over again. 
In short order he whips that one, then 
applies for Dorsai citizenship, re- 
trains the Dorsai into an effective 
fighting force (!), and restructures 
the entire political nature of the hu- 
man universe. He also gets the girl.

who seems no prize to me, seeing as 
one day she hates him, next day mar- 
ries him, next day hates him, fourth 
day . Well, you get the idea Dick- 
son was going to go back into the 
manuscript and fill out some moti- 
vation here, but realized his book was 
growing out of hand already. And it 
is. 1 haven’t even told you about his 
Magic Knee and what that leads to. 

Yet, again, here was a book I 
couldn’t put down. I was Dealing With 
Management myself at the time and 
badly needed the sleep, but 1 spent it on 
this story instead. 

One of the alternative explana- 
tions is that I’m getting soft in the 
head — forsaking the perceptive clar- 
ity of my youth, hardening my heart 
to the Important Things of the World, 
taking delight in depictions of agony 
and death. Would it help if you knew 
I’ve seen a little agony and death — and 
had a little knee trouble, too — and 1 
stopped grinning over them some time 
ago? I mean, I know what it feels like 
when Jerry flattens Tom’s face with a 
two-by-four. And I’ll bet you do, too. 
Perhaps, somehow, that’s why we get 
something meaningful out of battle 
scenes. 

Dickson’s a more thoughtful writer 
than Laumer, by some slight margin. 
That is to say, he cogitates more vis- 
ibly than Colonel Laumer does. 
There is more intellectual texture to 
Tactics of Mistake than there is to 
The Other Side of Time, just as there is 
far more in books by Nevil Shute, C.S. 
Forrester, or Robert Heinlein. But 
they are cut of the same cloth— taking 
the Heinlein of the thirty years begin- 
ning in the 1940s — and there is no 
denying the power of this kind of 
storytelling, for all that logical 
analysis yields some stuff that can 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



sound either ludicrous or gamy. The 
inside of the human mind is like that; 
the top layers of the brain, though they 
speak, do not represent the majority. 
Perhaps we shouldn’t be that 
way — but can we talk ourselves into 
some new condition? Not likely; the 
part that speaks is not the part that 
eats. 

Of the three books reviewed here, 
Laumer’s The Star Treasure (Put- 
nam, $4.95), is simplest and weakest. 

(Libraries get a heavy discount. 
Few of these books ever sell at the 
jacket price. Would a publisher care to 
try a drop in the retail price and a re- 
duction in the discount to libraries? 
Probably not. Yet it might get more 
copies into the hands of the civilians, 
all of whom are potential buyers for 
other books listed on the jacket-back 
by the same publisher). 

(So much for dreaming). 

Weak though it is — deus descends 
ex machina Finally to drive the truth 
through Ban Tarleton’s thick 
skull — there’s still a little of the good 
stuff here. There’s a lot of razzle-daz- 
zle about how the Star Lords run the 
Companies that eat off the happy 
Public, which you can discard. Es- 
sentially, Tarleton is the Man Who 
Doesn’t Know He Has The Secret, 
and has to keep dodging thunderbolts 
until it all dawns on him and he gets 
the Power. It’s hard to live with a dumb 
cluck like that, and most of us know 
we don’t have any Secret. But what 
Laumer apparently thought he was 
writing was the story about the man 
who Gets Handed the Package, and 
that’s a good one. All of us know that 
someday we’ll get handed The Pack- 
age by the mysterious blonde on the 
train to South Bend and then we’ll tell 
the boss to Go Scroo. Or we know we 
hope for it, and that’s close enough for 
comfort. ★

DUNCAN LUNAN 



GALILEAN 

PROBLEM 



NOVELETTE 



In Jupiter's gravity deeps, 
McKay had two choices: find 
his friend or lose himself! 

T hree alien ships towered in 
the sunlight on the Montana 
spacefield. Sharply swept fins 
tapering from near the nose gave 
each a triangular silhouette. It 
was unusual to see all three here at 
once, for their visits to Earth were 
staggered. They were the supply 
ships of an expedition opening 
up the moons of Jupiter for com- 
mercial exploitation. 

One of the ships was leaving. 
Sirens howled across the field; 
everyone on the base was under 
cover; shutters were lowered 
over the control tower windows, 
not to protect the personnel in 
the unlikely event of a fusion ex- 
plosion but to preserve the glass 
during a routine takeoff. Water 
began to eascade through the 
flame deflector of the launch pad. 

Through the tower periscope 
McKay saw the chemical motors 



ignite. The ship pushed up slowly, 
driving out steam around it for the 
few feet that saved the pad from 
evaporation- then the fusion 
motors fired at primary boost. Al- 
most hidden in blue-white glare 
the ship lifted, faster than McKay 
could follow it, into the clear sky. 

A mile up, with the shutters 
raised again, he could track it with 
binoculars, though the flame was 
still painfully bright. The freighter 
was tilting now, its trajectory 
carrying it into the Interface cor- 
ridor specified in relation to the 
field. 

Interface opened like a great 
black disk ahead of the ship. 
McKay was looking through a 
hole in the sky a half-mile across, 
not just out into space but into 
the very vicinity of Jupiter. The 
glare from the idling motors was 
still too bright for him to see stars 
and, to his disappointment, the 
Interface was not pointing to- 
ward Jupiter itself. The ship 
coasted up into the disk, its ex- 
haust suddenly splaying out, and 
the blue sky smoothed over behind 
it. Any two places each less than 
ten thousand miles from an Inter- 
face relay could be linked directly 
by air; a whole extraterrestrial 
race, the Eallaran, had dedicated 
themselves to enlarging the Inter- 
face net. It cost them slow sublight 
journeys to new stars. Earth’s sun 
was one of the newest to be 
reached. 

“That’s a better show than your 



148 




ship usually gives us,” the station 
commander remarked. “When are 
you going out there yourself?” 

“Another couple of days,” said 
McKay, putting the binoculars 
away. “When Cathy Devlin gets 
back from the Geneva confer-’ 
ence.” 

“That’s not going well, I hear.” 

“There’s a lot of frustration,” 
McKay agreed. “It’s the same old 
problem: all our dealings with In- 
terface civilizations, of what- 
ever kind, are channeled through 
the military format of the U.N. 
Committee for Earth’s Defense. 
The aliens definitely want a 
change — so do most of the govern- 
ments and private concerns try- 
ing to deal with them.” 

“You can’t blame the commit- 
tee for keeping tight control,” 
said the commander. “Earth was 
attacked from space and the Solar 
System was forcibly occupied by 
the Sasarenn not long ago. I’ve 
never been sorry 1 wasn’t in com- 
mand here then. Has anything 
been heard recently of the Sasa- 
renn and their war fleet?” 

McKay shook his head. “Noth- 
ing, I’m glad to say. Since they 
don’t have Interface or faster- 
than-light drive it’ll take them a 
hundred years to get here if they 
do decide to harass the Interface 
again.” 

Though the occupation against 
the Eallaran had been a time of 
great danger. Earth had come out 
of it relatively well. When the 



Furtherance, the Interface sur- 
vey fleet, threw the Sasarenn out. 
Earth was left with McKay as the 
recognized Planetary Agent and 
one versatile spaceship, the Sa- 
sarenn Recovery and Liaison 
Vehicle he still flew. Other plan- 
ets, he knew, had suffered heavily 
in the Sasarenn-Interface conflict. 

“And the earlier attackers? The 
A1 Tanrai?” 

“Nothing so far, though the Fur- 
therance are still moving into 
what the A1 Tanrai claim is their 
space. Since the Furtherance 
ships themselves are sub-light, it’s 
not surprising they haven’t met 
again yet. But the A1 Tanrai worry 
me: they do have FTL ships, they 
know Earth’s location and they 
know we’ve joined the Interface. 
I’m sure they’ll be back.” 

“All good grounds,” said the 
commander, “for leaving space 
affairs with the Committee for 
Earth’s Defense.” 

“But an increasing headache for 
me,” McKay replied as they left 
the tower. “Now there’s a per- 
manent base on lo, I have to get 
out there again and see that Earth’s 
interests are properly repre- 
sented. That’s not a military prob- 
lem — or a flying one — and I’ve no 
training for this kind of thing.” 

“And worst of all, being a mil- 
itary man yourself, you can’t tell 
them where to put their job.” The 
commander grinned sympa- 
thetically. “We all have that trou- 
ble at times.”

“Sure—” 

McKay left the tower a short 
time later and turned toward the 
RLV hangar. As he crossed the tar- 
mac his thoughts dwelt on the most 
tangible hold the job had on 
him — the communications relay 
forcibly implanted in his skull by 
the Sasarenn tied the ship and the 
Planetary Agent status ines- 
capably to his own personality. 
Whether or not his training equip- 
ped him for his present task, there 
was no other job he could 
hold — the implantation in his 
brain made him captive. 

T hey gathered at the ship in 
the early morning: McKay, 
Slazeck, Devlin and Cathy, her 
U.N. uniform changed for RLV 
flight overalls. McKay didn’t like 
having both Devlins along — a hus- 
band-and-wife team introduced 
an unpredictable dimension to 
an already hazardous mis- 
sion — but Cathy had proved her- 
self many times over on previous 
missions. They took their places in 
the cockpit and cabin and McKay 
took the ship up on its VTOL jets. 

Plugged in to the perception cir- 
cuits of the RLV, the pilot had all- 
around vision and full display 
from the ship’s sensors and com- 
puter-autopilot. The display in 
McKay’s brain traced out the In- 
terface corridor, catching the 
ship in a web of position fixes on 
the Interface relay in orbit over- 
head. McKay fed in the specifi- 



cations for this side — zero ground- 
speed, altitude 6,000 feet, gaseous 
diffusion nil — and for the other 
side: stable orbit two hundred 
miles above Callisto, the expe- 
dition’s emergence corridor. 
The trackers were locked on the re- 
lay satellite. 

“Up Interface — ” said McKay 
to the computer-autopilot. 

Seen from the ground. Inter- 
face was impressive; close up, if 
you had time to watch, it was an 
outstanding spectacle. A great 
circular window stood open in 
the Montana sky — open into 
the cold brilliance of the Jovian 
system. The RLV flew straight 
and level into it, the wings and air 
intakes folding back to the delta 
configuration as the last puffs of 
air crystallized astern. The com- 
puter made a flash position 
check on the Callisto relay and 
was satisfied; behind them 
Earth’s sky was brushed away. 

They were in shadow; Jupiter 
and the other moons were in two- 
thirds phase. Away from the plan- 
et a silent spread of stars filled the 
sky. The sudden transition to 
weightlessness brought its usual 
touch of elation. 

“That’s absolutely beautiful,” 
Cathy said from behind McKay in 
the cabin. 

“Ships in the offing,” Slazeck 
said quietly from in the co-pilot’s 
couch. 

“I see them.” McKay was alert, 
but not yet tensed up. He hadn’t 



150 



GALAXY 




expected to find the expedition 
here. When he flashed a recogni- 
tion pulse and got no answer he 
began to feel taut. 

“What’s wrong?” Cathy was 
sensitive to changes of psycho- 
logical atmosphere in the RLV. 

“Unknown ships ahead. There’s 
no visual sighting — you’ll have to 
plug in to radar.” 

“I’ve got them. Who do you 
think they are?” 

“Can’t tell, honey. They’re big 
ships, though, in the emergence 
orbit — thirteen of them. That 
could mean something. The Fur- 
therance group their ships by 
prime numbers, don’t they?” 

“Thirteen Futherance ships 
would be a fighting unit,” said 
Slazeck. “Have you heard any 
hints of trouble?” 

“Not a thing. I don’t think we’ll 
hurry to close up.” 

McKay was slowly overtaking 
the drifting ships. He calculated 
the RLV would be back in sun- 
light before reaching the others. 
He could make his ship radar-in- 
visible, bpt it seemed too late to 
make use of that precaution. 
There was still no reply to their 
continuing electronic chal- 
lenge, however, and as orbital 
sunrise drew nearer McKay went 
on the alert, sending a camera 
probe ahead. 

“They look like Furtherance 
ships,” said Devlin. 

“The Sasarenn used much the 
same design.” The tapered cylin- 



der, with wrap-around motor 
bulges, could well be the basic lay- 
out for all space warships. 

“Furtherance markings,” Dev- 
lin reported. 

“And still no radio contact, not 
even automatic identification. I 
don’t much care for this.” 

“1 have direct visual sighting, 
Mac. We’ll overhaul them our- 
selves in five minutes.” 

McKay thought hard. “All right, 
we’ll let that happen. This is a res- 
cue ship, after all. Go to full com- 
bat alert.” 

E xtra radiation shielding de- 
ployed, sealing off the cockpit 
and cabin. Acceleration shields 
closed over the occupants, iso- 
lating each in what could become 
an escape capsule. They were 
traveling tail first toward the for- 
mation, since McKay had slowed 
up slightly from the probe. Silent- 
ly the RLV came on, backward 
and — McKay realized from the 
markings — upside down. In space 
it made no difference. There was 
still no reaction, not even a laser 
flash, as they passed between the 
ships. 

“The one to our starboard, Mac 
— that’s the Darni, Kiliath’s new 
ship.” 

McKay recognized the red crest 
on the hull. Kiliath, Earth’s 
oldest Furtherance contact, had 
only recently gained his own com- 
mand and had paid a goodwill 
visit to Terra. 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



151 




Rendezvous maneuver had been 
preset — “Implement,” McKay 
told the ship, and a burst from the 
RLV’s chemical motors matched 
the orbits. 

The RLV’s search devices, now 
fully deployed on their out-of-at- 
mosphere booms, were finding 
nothing unusual about the dor- 
mant ships themselves — but bio- 
scan, despite the hull shielding, 
was picking up definite traces from 
the Darni. McKay made a long, 
detailed scan of it while the ships 
hung in the pinhead sunlight and 
the moon’s face turned slowly 
past. 

“Something odd there,” he said. 
“It’s as if there were spots of life, 
shading off into nothing, on the 
outer hull of the ship. Any 
theories?” 

“None at all, Mac,” said Sla- 
zeck after a pause. “But we’ve got 
about forty minutes of sunlight if 
we want to make closer checks.” 

“We’ll leave the RLV out here,” 
McKay said firmly. “Whatever’s 
wrong, it’s affected all the ships in 
the formation. I’ll take a sled 
over there and go in through the 
lock. Walt, you’re in command. 
Dev, come with me.” 

They could have separated their 
capsules from the ship’s life-sup- 
port and made the crossing in 
them, but McKay wanted more 
freedom of action. Reopening 
the radiation bulkheads, he and 
Devlin made their way to the RLV 
lock, put on full spacesuits, then 



deployed two unused couch-sled 
units from the cabin. McKay never 
got over his admiration for this 
part of the RLV design: G-couch, 
stretcher unit, airsled, ejection 
capsule all in a single system. 
They depressurized the airlock, 
lowered the outer door and worked 
around it to walk up the hull to the 
rescue hatches. Casting off the 
sleds, they moved on compressed- 
air jets toward the warship. They 
kept the shielding open — since 
they were in full suits — and crossed 
to the Darni without incident. 

McKay wouldn’t have risked a 
guess as to whether they could get 
in or not, but the Darni' s airlock 
opened first time. They moored the 
sleds, went through the lock — and 
found themselves facing three Fal- 
laran crewmen with guns. 

Beyond doubt they meant busi- 
ness. They were anchored firmly 
against recoil in zero-G; their 
weapons weren’t heavy enough to 
do structural damage to the ship 
and, after they took aim, there 
wasn’t a tremor of movement. 
Moving slowly, McKay opened up 
his helmet faceplate. 

“Good morning,” he said. 
“Where’s Kiliath?” 

H IS suit radio was on — to link 
with the ship’s computer trans- 
lation — but all he heard in reply 
was a rumble of Fallaran speech. 
On the radio there was nothing. 

This was going to be difficult — 
what the hell could be wrong? He 



152 



GALAXY 




couldn’t say offhand if he’d met 
these crewmen before. The Fallar- 
an were high-gravity humanoids 
with gray, wrinkled skin and bril- 
liant eyes. To tell them apart was 
not easy — but these three didn’t 
seem to recognize him. 

“McKay,” he said forcefully. 
“Where’s Kiliath?” 

Talking naturally to the Fal- 
laran was difficult: the aliens 
were quiet-spoken and their nat- 
ural range of speech and hearing 
fell somewhat below the human 
voice. As far as McKay could see, 
they hadn’t recognized his or 
their own captain’s names; but an 
officer who did know McKay 
finally came padding in grip shoes 
down the spiral steps from the con- 
trol deck — and the guns were 
turned aside. 

McKay began to wish he had 
brought Cathy over; she had found 
time to learn some of the Fallaran 
language. The officer hauled 
McKay over to a control terminal 
and indicated he should “plug 
in.” Doing so, fading out the scene 
around him, McKay found an ex- 
traordinary situation. The per- 
ception circuits of the Further- 
ance ships were essentially simi- 
lar to the RLV’s — he should have 
been able to study the full field of 
view outside, read off the ship’s 
course and position, make a full 
systems check — he experienced 
nothing. It was as if the “con- 
sciousness” functions of the 
ship’s brain had been knocked out. 



The only readouts he could get 
were for routine internal func- 
tions, such as life-support. All sen- 
sors outside the hull — and most of 
the “thinking” part of the ma- 
chine they served — gave no re- 
sponse. Vital functions like navi- 
gation and attitude control were 
completely paralyzed — in short, 
the great warship, the machine it- 
self, was asleep. 

McKay let go the terminal and 
blinked back to reality. This had 
to be connected with the odd bio- 
scan impressions on the hull of 
the Darni, which its own instru- 
ments couldn’t detect. He turned 
to the officer, pointed to his space- 
suit, then to the airlock. The Fal- 
laran suited up and followed 
McKay to the outside. 

A S SOON as the outer door 
swung out, they could talk via 
the RLV’s computer. Floating 
against the scarred ice face of Cal- 
listo, the little white ship was still 
unaffected by whatever had at- 
tacked the dreadnaught. Quickly 
the officer told them, through the 
flat neutrality of the computer 
translation, what had happened: a 
beacon calling for help had come 
through Interface to the Further- 
ance HQ at Alpha Centauri. The 
Darni had come to investigate, 
found the lo expedition under at- 
tack by strange ships. Distrusting 
beacons, unwilling to leave the 
scene of action in the Jupiter sys- 
tem, Kiliath had sent the Darni to 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



153 




fetch reinforcements — but shortly 
after the fleet had come through 
the Callisto Interface the sophisti- 
cated brains of the warships had 
been affected by what could only 
be called drowsiness. Within min- 
utes, the ships were in effect un- 
conscious. 

As he learned all this, McKay 
was leading the officer toward 
one of the strange spots on the hull. 
Though the Darni was huge by 
Earth standards, it wasn’t one of 
the bigger starships — McKay 
thought of it as in the destroyer 
class. It didn’t have enough mass to 
pull them effectively to itself and 
they were using safety lines as they 
worked their way around. Di- 
rected by Slazeck, they came on 
the thing within minutes. 

It didn’t look at all fearsome: 
strange, perhaps, but not some- 
thing to reduce a fighting ship to 
paralysis. It was a yellow sphere, 
smaller than a football, raised 
from the hull on a thin stalk. The 
stalk itself seemed to merge into 
the hull. Looking very closely, 
McKay found a fine web of fila- 
ments, like neryes, radiating out 
from it across the metal. A cluster 
of these, like tiny biological 
mines, had brought the Further- 
ance fleet to a standstill. 

“Combat alert, Mac,” Slazeck 
announced — grim, tense, but con- 
trolled. “Four ships in the sun, 
closing very fast.” 

“Interception course?” 

“Dead on.” 



McKay didn’t hesitate — he had 
a very good idea by now of what 
was happening. “Cross it at a hun- 
dred miles with all our missiles, 
spread launch from here. And put 
two clumps of antis into the line 
behind them. Open fire.” 

McKay and the Fallaran 
watched the missiles go off, each 
burning a different trail through 
the formation before flaring at 
full boost toward the sun. Com- 
mon sense called them to take 
cover, but inside the Darni they 
would be cut off. At their very high 
approach speed — Slazeck made it 
hundreds of miles a second — the 
attacking pilots had very little 
decision time. They might just 
take the RLV’s six missiles for a 
preliminary salvo from the fleet 
that should have been quiescent. 
They shouldn’t have time to look 
for alternatives. 

“They’ve altered course, Mac,” 
said Slazeck, without any detec- 
table relief. “They’re passing at 
three hundred miles, going to- 
ward the planet. We must have had 
a whole second in hand there.” 

“They very nearly got us,” 
McKay agreed. He was quite un- 
able to cover his own relief. “That 
speed sounds like FTL drive, 
right?” 

“No Interface relays out where 
they come from, that’s for sure. 
You think it’s the A1 Tanrai 
again?” 

“I’ve a good clue to them right 
here,” said McKay. He turned to 



154 



GALAXY 




the Furtherance officer. “When 
we met the A1 Tanrai on the planet 
Sarann they had the technology to 
bug Interface relays.” 

“I remember that,” said the Fal- 
laran. “I served under Kiliath on 
that mission also.” 

“My apologies,” said McKay. 
“Then you know their bugs were 
organic, or pseudo-organic — a 
thing like a film of tissue stretched 
across an Interface and designed 
to cling to the ship that broke it. 
This must be something similar: a 
bug that interacts with the per- 
ception circuits, hypnotizes them, 
you might say. Bioengineering in 
a further stage.” 

“The thing seems purely or- 
ganic,” said the officer. “We can 
burn it off the hull without risk. I 
shall bring out crewmen with 
weapons.” 

“We’ll move on,” said McKay. 
“I’ll take the ship across to lo — I’ll 
try falling tail first through the In- 
terface with the motor on. If there 
are any bugs left on this satellite, 
that should keep us clear.” 

He was tempted, but for the time 
it would take, to go after the 
RLV’s missiles and bring them 
back aboard. Though the Fallaran 
came from a planet heavier than 
Earth, they had nothing in com- 
mon with the A1 Tanrai, who had 
once attacked Earth. The A1 Tan- 
rai, literally “the Cosmic Jack- 
als,’’ came from a planet big 
enough to have a world like Earth 
for a satellite. When they had at- 



tacked McKay on Sarann — one of 
his first Interface missions — he 
had shown them no mercy. They 
were part of the darkness that had 
fallen on Earth years before. They 
were a group mind, without indi- 
viduality; dwellers in methane 
and ammonia, in great cold and 
pressure, such as — he took a step 
up the hull to gaze into the plan- 
et’s brilliance — such as they would 
find far down in Jupiter itself. 

II 

T he plan succeeded from the 
outset. Approaching the Inter- 
face tail first, McKay put a burst of 
flame into it — and if any pseudo- 
organic webs were stretched 
across the invisible disc they were 
burned away. The ring traced by 
the electronic display moved over 
the ship and past, and Jupiter 
leaped closer in the sky. lo was no- 
ticeably more reflective than 
Callisto, but the overall color 
difference noted from Earth was 
harder to detect at close hand. A 
smooth sheet of ice along the 
equator, broken by occasional 
mountains, added to the moon’s 
greater brilliance. Only one of the 
expedition’s big ships was in 
orbit; the others had touched down 
at the most promising site for a 
permanent base. 

So far, McKay learned on the 
radio, the expedition’s sensors 
and computers had not been af- 
fected by the enemy. The task force 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



155 




sat tight, waiting for the Further- 
ance reinforcements; there had 
been no more attacks. But Kiliath 
himself had shown their danger. 
Could the RLV help? 

“That’s what we’re here for,” 
said McKay. “What’s happened 
to him?” 

“He took a shuttle to make re- 
connaissance,” the Fallaran said 
in the stilted phrasing of compu- 
ter translation. “He went through 
Interface to a fast trajectory, a 
close flyby of Jupiter. He had 
concealed his ship from radar, but 
when he emerged from Interface 
on his new trajectory we detec- 
ted him at once. However we 
could not contact him again by 
radio.” 

All that made sense. To screen a 
ship from radar required a com- 
plex pulse-interaction with the 
oncoming beam, something only 
a computer could handle. With 
external sensors out nothing could 
be done. And at the position and 
velocity Kiliath had set for the 
other side of his Interface, he 
would have been out of range by 
the time he regained control — if 
he had. The lo radar had tracked 
him far toward Jupiter before 
losing the tiny blip of the shuttle. 

“Kiliath’s shuttle was obvious- 
ly hit by a bug,” said McKay. “We 
can avoid that as before, I think. 
We’ll match orbit with him when 
he comes past here.” 

“This will be the only chance,” 
said the Fallaran. “Since the shut- 



tle can change its velocity by only 
two miles a second, only Inter- 
face can put it on or off its present 
trajectory. Kiliath aimed to be 
within Interface range of lo on 
this pass, but unless course cor- 
rection is made near the planet 
next time, the shuttle will be too 
far from here when it next crosses 
lo’s orbit.” 

“We may have to abandon the 
shuttle, then,” Slazeck remarked. 
“Velocity-change requirements in 
Jupiter’s gravity well are gigantic. 
We should have brought extra 
tanks along.” 

“First our missiles gone, next 
our fuel. When’s the shuttle going 
to pass lo?” 

“Two more hours. Maybe we 
can pull Kiliath out of it before 
we go out of range — or set up an 
Interface for both ships. If we do 
have to take a wild ride around Ju- 
piter — are we all going to go?” 

“Whom were you thinking of 
leaving out?” Cathy asked omi- 
nously. 



T he shuttle came swinging up 
from Jupiter on schedule, 
though radar had found it some 
time before. It was going to pass 
lo about a thousand miles beyond 
Interface range. 

“What do you make of that, 
Walt?” asked McKay. 

“Maybe the bug altered the em- 
ergence side of the Interface 
slightly. Our orbit wasn’t exactly 



156 



GALAXY 




matched with the Furtherance 
fleet.” 

“Maybe Kiliath made a manual 
course change for some reason.” 

“Maybe the Red Spot’s a mas- 
con, pulled him off course.” 

“Anyway, we’re going after 
him,” said McKay. “That’s as 
close to lo as the shuttle will ever 
get. Even if we didn’t have a friend 
aboard we’d be bound to try a res- 
cue.” He set up an Interface to 
project them for rendezvous. 
“Five minutes to go. Stand by.” 

There was quite a feeling of com- 
mitment, he had to admit as he 
burned backward through the disk 
into transfer orbit. He was 
launching the REV into a close 
pass around that banded sphere, 
close enough to use the belts as 
highway markers. He would have 
to use a lot of fuel, down close to 
the planet, to achieve a course that 
would bring the ship back to lo. If 
he ran into trouble it would take a 
warship or one of the big freighters 
to get him out. McKay decided to 
go radar-invisible and get away 
from the shuttle after the rescue. 

Slowly he closed with Kiliath’s 
ship as the trajectory swung over 
its peak and began to lead him 
down toward the planet. McKay 
had allowed time here to save fuel. 
Eventually he made a transfer 
burn, a first bite out of the RLV’s 
twelve mps total, and closed for the 
rendezvous. 

The shuttle was the standard 
type he had seen, even used, on 



other missions — stub wings, no 
variable geometry, designed to 
enter and leave atmosphere 
through Interface. The REV, de- 
signed as a unit of the Sasarenn 
War Fleet, could carry less but do a 
great deal more — for instance, go 
to Earth’s Moon and back on its 
own power and fuel. 

As it closed with the shuttle the 
RLV’s bioscan picked out the 
same light traces over the hull as it 
had found on the Darni. By now 
McKay felt reasonably sure that 
he could link the two ships without 
the RLV’s being “infected.” He 
brought the ship in close, pre- 
senting the open airlock in the 
underside to the starboard hatch 
of the shuttle, and extended a 
flexible rescue tube from the 
RLV’s lock to cover it. Sealed, 
pressurized, it gave him easy ac- 
cess to the shuttle. 

There had been no radio contact 
with Kiliath, obviously, since 
the bug still covered the shuttle’s 
outer hull. No doubt the REV had 
been seen and recognized, how- 
ever, from the cockpit; Kiliath 
would be waiting for rescue be- 
yond the lock. Since the ship was 
intact, McKay thought all would 
be well inside, as with the Dar- 
ni — and this proved to be overcon- 
fidence. 

Kiliath was in the main cabin, 
unconscious. Two immediate ex- 
planations arose for the shuttle’s 
change of orbit — first that it was a 
trap, second that it was straight- 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



157 




forwardly due to mass increase. 
For the cabin was occupied by 
the humanoid servants of the A1 
Tanrai. 

M cKAY froze, floating in the 
shuttle’s open lock. Once 
again he was the target of steadily 
trained guns. There was no way to 
talk to these creatures in their 
golden spacesuits because they 
had no individuality; their 
brains contained only the reflec- 
ted thoughts of the Jackals them- 
selves. They were, in effect, an- 
droids. Where were their control- 
lers, the particular elements of 
the group-mind to which these 
served as hands and eyes? No- 
where on the shuttle, obviously; 
no pressurized, refrigerated 
tanks here. Perhaps there was a 
Jackal ship hovering nearby, it- 
self radar-invisible; but McKay 
had made a full combat alert scan 
before the rendezvous. The 
RLV’s rescue-mission sensors 
should have found it visually. If he 
could knock out the controllers, 
McKay knew, the slaves would be 
mindless; but it looked very much 
as if the controllers were down on 
Jupiter itself, out of reach. 

He could talk to the controllers 
through the RLV computer, he 
knew from the Sarann encoun- 
ter — whether he could talk to them 
through these creatures, he didn’t 
know. He was still looking for 
something to say when the near- 
est of them moved, still covering 



McKay with his gun — making it 
clear by his angle of approach that 
McKay was to return to the RLV 
and that the A1 Tanrai would fol- 
low McKay through the lock. The 
gun looked heavier than a Fal- 
laran weapon designed for close 
quarters — it might well blow a 
hole in the RLV hull beyond. In 
their golden spacesuits — did they 
ever take them off? — the Jackals 
wouldn’t mind, but McKay would. 
He backed down the tube and the 
creature grasped the lock sill and 
pulled itself in. 

McKay’s main worry was for 
Kiliath. Unless the Jackals had a 
nuclear device in the shuttle, 
they couldn’t destroy the RLV; 
the shuttle itself was unarmed. 
The RLV’s computer was con- 
scious and functioning, the shut- 
tle’s obviously was not. And 
though the A1 Tanrai couldn’t 
know it, the relay embedded in 
McKay’s skull responded quite ef- 
fectively to crude mental states 
like “alarm.” If anything, the 
computer was too sensitive to 
the Planetary Agent’s worries; in 
his early days with the ship he of- 
ten had had to calm it down. A 
similar unit in the RLV’s satel- 
lite tender had killed a friend of 
his during the Sasarenn conflict. 
So, as McKay backed out of the 
connecting tube, he could almost 
feel the hidden weapons locking 
on the golden helmet that came 
through behind him. 

There was an override to let him 



158 



GALAXY 




enter the cabin with the outer door 
still open. McKay backed in, still 
with the Jackal gun pointing at 
his chest, feeling almost sorry for 
the enigmatic figure coming 
through the hatch. Unless this one 
was very careful, he wasn’t going 
to get out alive. 

“Everybody stay calm,” said 
McKay. “Spread out some more.” 

Cathy was as white as a ghost, 
with every reason. Raiding on 
Earth, the Jackals had taken only 
women prisoners. They had taken 
Cathy on Sarann; Kiliath’s sec- 
ond officer, the only one with her, 
had died trying to stop them. 
Having no individuality them- 
selves, would the A1 Tanrai recog- 
nize her — or seize her again? 

The android was checking the 
cabin, without giving them any 
openings to jump him. Had he, or 
rather they, any idea of his dan- 
ger? All the humans were wearing 
identity badges; the ship would 
shoot around them and over them. 

Perhaps at that range the Jack- 
als were using radio to boost their 
commands — or perhaps the an- 
droid vocalized the thought 
prompting him to action. Over the 
cabin speakers, in the computer 
translation monotone, came the 
flat speech: “Identification — Earth 
humans. No samples required. De- 
stroy and check control section.” 

McKay didn’t have to do any- 
thing; the RLV computer knew 
now it had to act. The android 
took a step back to clear his wea- 



pon and open fire — and was hit si- 
multaneously by bright, straight 
laser beams from all around the 
cabin. With an easy target, a hu- 
manoid shape, the computer had it 
all worked out — it hit the trigger 
hand, the muscles of that arm, a 
knee, the heart, pin-pointed by 
acoustic sensors (right of center). 
The RLV was a reseue ship, but its 
medic tapes knew no Hippocratic 
Oath. 

The android flopped in zero-G 
like a rag doll trying to come apart, 
puffs of smoke squeezing through 
the holes in the suit. McKay dived 
for a wall panel to blow the tube 
out of the lock and slam the hatch, 
but in that he was too slow. The A1 
Tanrai and their slaves were not 
merely telepaths, they were a sin- 
gle mental entity. On reaction 
times they had a head start: 
McKay got the ship clear, but 
something was shut in with them. 
A strange screeching noise filled 
his ears — then the golden android 
and the whole eabin were turning 
around him. After that he blacked 
out completely. 

E ventually he came back. 

He floated listlessly for a few 
seconds more, but his head was 
clearing fast. Slazeck, he saw, 
had managed to get an antidote 
from the medic tapes and was 
dosing the others. The golden 
figure of the android was gone, but 
one of the acceleration shields

was closed like a coffin, cutting 
down cabin space. 

“They got the biological word 
on us from Cathy on Sarann,” 
grunted Slazeck. “Time we 
learned more about them.” 

“Sure,” said McKay, still dazed. 
“Did they try to get the body back, 
I wonder?” 

“Looks like it. We’re still on ex- 
ternal anti-personnel alert and 
the guns have been fired.” 

“God, 1 hope we didn’t hit Kil- 
iath.” McKay shook his head. 
“What’s our present status?” 

“Who knows?” Slazeck said 
grimly. 

That woke McKay up — he 
pulled out his pocket communi- 
cator. Sure enough, the RLV per- 
ception circuits were blank, as 
had been the Darni’s earlier. Only 
internal routine — power plant, 
life support — glowed in his head. 

“Playback.” 

In seconds he had the end of the 
external recording; an exchange 
of shots with Jackals at the shut- 
tle airlock; then something was 
fired from a long tube, spreading 
before it hit the hull, and dark- 
ness spreading from it around the 
outside of the ship, sealing out the 
planet, the moons, the shuttle and 
the stars. 

“Listen — the bug’s in line with 
the lock, about eight feet back. 
Maybe if we can knock out its 
nerve center we’ll be able to see 
again. Have you looked out up 
front?” 



“No, you do that and I’ll suit up. 
I’ll use the drilling laser on it, 
okay?” 

McKay opened the connecting 
hatch to the cockpit, pulled him- 
self through. The outer shutters 
were down and bright stars glit- 
tered across the windows. After 
years with the RLV, so narrow a 
field of view upset him. Without 
the perception circuits, the 
blank, unmarked controls would 
be the devil to use. There were no 
ordinary instruments, not even a 
radar screen. 

He thumbed the personal com- 
municator. “Can’t see a thing 
from here, Walt. Stand by and I’ll 
swing the ship.” 

“That’ll take too long without 
instruments, Mac. If they’re sit- 
ting out there covering the lock, 
they’ve got us cold anyway — but 
we’ve been out for two hours.”- 

“Okay. Good luck, Walt.” 

In weightlessness, Slazeck had 
the option which way up he stood 
in the lock. He had chosen upside- 
down, so he could come out head 
first with the outer door half 
opened over him, where it would be 
when the ship was on the ground. 
He broke out the high-powered 
laser, intended for cutting into 
wrecked spaceships, and it came 
up with him like a machine-gun.

S LAZECK, the man nothing sur- 
prised, could not say after- 



160 



GALAXY 




ward if he had sworn, shouted 
wordlessly or been stunned to si- 
lence. Since he was out of the hull 
the others could not have heard 
him. He was looking down the 
hull, with the rectangular outer 
door raised like a trap above him. 
The Jackal bug was only feet 
away, poised impudently on its 
fragile stalk. Low in the lock, he 
saw only the wingtips and the fore- 
shortened belly of the ship. And all 
the rest, so close that curvature 
was lost, was Jupiter like a flat, 
banded wall. 

His brain ticked on behind his 
shocked face. The motors had not 
been used; another ship must have 
taken the Jackals off the shuttle 
and the field of their drive must 
have pushed the RLV toward the 
big planet. He had to get that bug! 
He aimed the heavy laser over the 
lock sill and let fly. The first shot 
only clipped the thing, but the sec- 
ond took it just above the stem and 
split it apart. 

McKay’s voice swelled pres- 
ently in his headphones: “Fine, 
Walt, sensors are coming on — 
great God Almighty!” 

“I’m coming back in, Mac,” 
Slazeck radioed with no con- 
scious irreverence. He pushed the 
laser down into the lock, bringing 
down the door behind him. Air 
was roaring in as he stowed the 
laser again. 

He had no time to take off the 
suit. He opened the inner hatch, 
pulled upside-down into the 



cabin, turned over and down into a 
G-couch. The hatch and the radi- 
ation bulkhead closed behind 
him. His partner across the aisle, 
he noticed as his acceleration 
shielding closed, was the corpse of 
the Jackal android, entombed in 
its armor. 

“Secondary boost, three-second 
warning,” said McKay. 

He hadn’t a hope in hell of get- 
ting the RLV clear of the planet: 
the fusion motor was pointing 
straight down to kill as much as 
possible of their vertical compo- 
nent. 

“I hope — ” said Cathy, as the 
ship hung, sinking, on a blue 
column of intense fire. She started 
again. “I hope nobody minds that 
I’m scared, but please tell me what 
you’re trying.” 

“We’re trying to get a usable 
angle on the atmosphere, hon- 
ey,” said Devlin. “As it stands 
we’re going straight in to burn up. 
If we can get our vertical com- 
ponent of velocity down to the 
same order of magnitude as the 
horizontal one, we may just be 
able to make an Earth-type entry.” 

“I see,” said Cathy in a very 
small voice. 

At full acceleration, the RLV’s 
fuel went down with appalling 
speed. There wasn’t the infor- 
mation to compute an entry win- 
dow for Jupiter, but what they 
got looked reasonable. The last of 
their fuel burned away with about a 
minute to spare, and McKay set 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



161 




the ship’s attitude for entry with 
the greatest care. 

A RED envelope of flame grew 
from under the nose, steam- 
ing up to meet above the ship. An- 
other, sliding under the wings, 
went up to meet behind the tail fin. 
Holding that precious angle, the 
RLV fell into Jupiter. 

“In this gravity the atmosphere 
layers corresponding to the 
Earth’s are packed much more 
closely together,” McKay an- 
nounced. “See how much our path 
is flattening?” 

“We’re getting hypersonic 
bounce effect,” said Devlin, plug- 
ged in as copilot. 

“The last stage of that will be vi- 
tal,” said McKay. “When we shed 
this plasma envelope we’re going 
to have to hit the bounce angle ex- 
actly. The layer corresponding in 
density to Earth’s stratosphere 
will be so shallow that our opti- 
mum entry corridor is a line 
without dimensions. If we cut 
too deep into the atmosphere at 
this speed we’ll melt, though we 
missed burning up. We’ve got far 
more wingspan than we need to 
stay up in this gravity — too hard a 
bounce will probably pull the 
wings right off.” 

“Cross your fingers, people,” 
said Devlin. “Here it comes.” 
McKay had to leave this to the 
computer-autopilot, for its re- 
actions and calculations were 
way ahead of his own. As the ion- 



ization faded there was some hair- 
raising juggling of data, with cas- 
cades of figures for temperature 
and stress running in the display; 
but at the end of it they were flying 
level in a very fast glide, with Jupi- 
ter’s clouds spread below them 
like an immense plain. The deep 
yellow tint from space was almost 
gone; only a hint of it was left un- 
der the white tops of the clouds. 
The horizon was incredibly far 
away. Overhead the sky was deep 
blue, not too unlike Earth’s at a 
corresponding altitude, but that 
wasn’t oxygen scattering the light. 

“Wow,” said Devlin. “Nice 
piece of flying, ship.” 

“You said it.” 

“Ho w will we get out of here?” 
“Just like a woman,” said Dev- 
lin. “We only just go/ here.” 

“We’ve lost a lot of our speed,” 
said McKay. “If we had full tanks 
we could climb out again, but we 
don’t have them.” 

“Only one way out of this,” 
Slazeck commented from the rear. 
“The Furtherance will have to 
bring a relay to within ten thou- 
sand miles of the planet — then we 
can go straight home if we want.” 
“We will get out eventually?” 
Cathy asked. 

“Of course we will,” said 
McKay. He couldn’t help adding: 
“Still, it’s going to be one of the 
greatest flying stories of all time.” 

T he ship sped on, dipping slight- 
ly as its speed came down. Each 



162 



GALAXY 




lime the drop in altitude was slight, 
but produced enough extra lift to 
bounce them back up again. They 
could have skipped right around 
the Earth like that, but in this 
gravity the effect was insignificant. 
Eventually the ship began to de- 
scend noticeably and McKay 
touched off the fusion ramjets and 
leveled out. 

“That makes me feel better,” 
said Slazeck. “Stability, that’s 
what I like.” 

“I don’t feel much safer,” said 
McKay. “Walt, how far down 
would you say those clouds are?” 
“Hard to say, Mac. Radar 
shows big turbulence forty, fifty 
thousand feet down.” 

“Yeah. I bet the atmosphere 
down there’s already denser than 
Earth sea-level — and it goes on 
down for a long way. We’ve got 
about thirty thousand feet sepa- 
rating us from the most violent en- 
vironment in the Solar System, 
off the sun itself.” 

“That’s not much, even in this 
gravity.” 

“You said it. One airpock- 
et — or a major outbreak below 
us — and we are in big trouble. 
Jovian Clear Air Turbulence will 
take this ship apart, probably be- 
fore we know it.” 

“You’ve talked me into leaving. 
Have you raised anyone by 
radio?” 

“No chance. That’s not so much 
an ionosphere up there — it’s like 
trying to signal through a sheet of 



lightning. Do you remember the 
intensity of the radiation belts, 
out by lo?” 

“We’re going to see some pretty 
aurorae, come nightfall.” 

“I guess so, even at these lati- 
tudes. And the lower edges of the 
display won’t be far above us. No- 
tice what else is interfering with 
the radio?” 

“The overall pattern’s like light- 
ning, but some of the peaks are gi- 
gantic.” 

“Jupiter’s radio noise reaches 
Earth,” said McKay. “There are 
some big storms around some- 
where.” - 

“So we may not be able to raise 
the expedition or the Further- 
ance fleet,” Slazeck said slowly. 
“And if we were within ten thou- 
sand miles of an Interface relay, 
we might not be able to contact it. 
If that’s true, Mac, our only way 
out of here is with the rocket.” 

“And we used all our fuel slow- 
ing down,” McKay agreed grimly. 
“We do have equipment to 
process more, but it’s a long slow 
job even in an atmosphere with so 
much free hydrogen. And since it 
requires modifying the air in- 
takes and turning most of the fus- 
ion pile output to refrigeration, 
we can’t do it unless we land 
somewhere.” 

“And solid ground is thousands 
of miles below us.” 

“Right. I don’t know if the Fur- 
therance ships can process fuel in 
flight; maybe the Darni could 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



163 




come down and refuel us — if we 
can contact them in the first 
place.” 

“If we can contact them at all, 
they can position an Interface re- 
lay for us,” Slazeck pointed out. 
“What about the Great Red Spot, 
skipper — isn’t that supposed to be 
solid?” 

“Nobody knew what that was 
when I read up on Jupiter,” said 
McKay. “There was a theory that it 
might be a proto-satellite that 
never separated from the planet 
and floats like an iceberg on the 
denser atmosphere below. Parts of 
it might be solid enough for a 
touchdown.” 

“We’d have to leave the ship to 
set up the refueling apparatus.” 

“We could use the rescue sys- 
tems: a manipulator unit on the 
front of a stretcher module. We’d 
find it impossible to work in suits, 
that’s for sure.” 

“Surface gravity’s higher than 
Earth’s, isn’t it?” Cathy put in. 
“That’s why we’re still in accelera- 
tion shields.” 

“Two point six four times what 
we can cope with,” said McKay. 
“The Fallaran wouldn’t find it so 
much trouble.” 

“Do you think the Jackals 
brought Kiliath down here?” Dev- 
lin asked. 

“If they did they’ll be much 
deeper than we are,” said McKay. 
“We were worrying about how 
the Furtherance can find us on a 
surface area a hundred and 



twenty times the Earth’s — and 
we’re on the top of it! How can 
they find Kiliath underneath?” 

N O ANSWERS came up. “Can 
we get back to the gravity for a 
moment?” Cathy asked at last. 
“Are we trapped in these 
shields — as if we’d used them as es- 
cape capsules?” 

“Pretty much so,” McKay re- 
plied. “You won’t die of the gravity 
or even black out — but if you man- 
aged to get off the couch you 
might not get back. It’s just as well 
these units can function as escape 
capsules — it means we’ve all got 
emergency procedures to hand.” 
“That’s not much good to me,” 
grunted Slazeck. “I’m still wear- 
ing a full spacesuit, remember? 
It’s damned uncomfortable. I’m 
going to open the shielding and 
try to get some of it off.” 

“Take it easy, Walt.” 

“If I get into trouble I’ll yell and 
you come running.” 

Slazeck worked his gauntlets off 
without too much trouble, but by 
the time he’d manipulated off his 
helmet he needed rest. They 
went back to discussing the land- 
ing possibility. 

“How far is the Red Spot from 
us?” asked Devlin. 

“Well, we’re in the right hemi- 
sphere — I got our latitude from 
the sun, early on. We should be in 
the south tropical belt, but that’s 
not a permanent feature of the 
planet; sometimes it splits or fades. 



164 



GALAXY 




I didn’t notice whether it could be 
seen from lo or Callisto — it 
seemed academic at the time — but 
if we’re traveling in a clear strip 
within the belt we could run into 
big turbulence farther along. 
The Red Spot is mainly in the 
south temperate zone, but the 
south tropical belt curves around 
it to the north. In other words we’ll 
hit the Spot eventually, but right 
now we could be flying toward it 
or away from it.” 

“We’re flying away from the 
sun, that’s for sure,” said Devlin. 
“At this speed it’ll be on the 
horizon in half an hour.” 

“We’re in System One, the 
equatorial rotation zone,” said 
McKay. “Twenty-eight thousand 
miles an hour, plus our airspeed.” 
“Shall we turn?” 

“We can’t outfly the sun on this 
planet — we’d only stretch the 
night. On this course darkness will 
last less than five hours.” 

The incredible distance of the 
horizon, the great flatness of Ju- 
piter, emphasized the speed of 
the sun’s arc towards the thicken- 
ing haze. Only a quarter of its 
Earth size, the planet burned deep- 
er red through greater thickness 
of atmosphere. Straight-edged 
shells of color crept over the 
clouds below, then fell upward to 
tinge the hull and the sluggish 
contrails drawn by the ship. As the 
spectacle grew, so did the turbu- 
lence below them. The charged 
layers of compressed atmos- 



phere were lifting with nightfall; 
waves of lightning passed beneath 
toward the dark horizon as 
potentials changed in the clouds 
and their suspended ice crystals. 
In the deeps off to starboard some 
atmospheric system, super- 
charged with physical or chemi- 
cal energy, suddenly tripped. A 
huge mushroom cloud, flattened 
almost beyond recognition, 
welled out of the blackness and 
stood like an autumn tree in the 
blood-red sunset. There were more 
eruptions across the field, like an 
evening growth of fungi, as the 
shadows began to stretch over the 
clouds themselves. 

“We’re making Mach one point 
two,” McKay pointed out, main- 
ly for Cathy. “We’ll outfly the 
shockwaves from that burst on our 
right.” 

“Just as long as we don’t get one 
in front of us,” said Devlin. “It’s 
like driving over flat country un- 
der random shelling.” 

“That’s quite a shellburst,” said 
Slazeck. “How many megatons 
would you need to make a stalk 
that big?” 

As at the Earth’s equator, full 
darkness fell like a blanket. There 
were aurorae as expected, thin 
sheets flitting across the stars 
close above them. There were 
meteors, too, with that mighty 
gravity to sweep down the aster- 
oids; brilliant streaks across the 
sky, seeming close enough to 
touch. Now they could iee just how 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



165 




thin a layer of fragile stability 
was holding the ship. A fierce glow 
lit a circle of cloud from below 
and another dark fountain rose, 
but again the RLV passed by un- 
shaken. 

We have to get out of here . 

*^117 E’D better go on a watch 

■■ system,” said Slazeck. 
“With two nights in every twenty- 
four hours, we can’t go by local 
time. Let’s you and me get some 
sleep, Mac — Dev can wake me be- 
fore dawn.” 

Significantly older than the oth- 
ers, McKay was happy to be first 
for sleep. The effect might have 
been psychological, with the 
whole ship weighted down by Jupi- 
ter, but he felt exhausted. Later, 
sleep was less pleasant. Not night- 
mares, exactly, but a repeating, 
intensely sad image of the RLV, 
without fuel and somehow with- 
out power, going down, troubled 
him. Out of the sunlight, into the 
tops of the clouds that went down 
for thousands of miles, the rum- 
ble of their thunder reaching in 
through the hull; broken up by 
turbulence, crushed by mounting 
pressure, sometimes sinking in- 
to icy blackness, but always go- 
ing down. 

“Mac, wake up.” 

McKay snapped out of the hun- 
dredth descent with relief. Even a 
wild scare would be better than 
that recurring tragedy. They 
were coming through the dawn. 



through the colored layers into 
clear sunlight — and it revealed 
things McKay would have hated 
to have hit in the dark. 

“I think we’ve found the Red 
Spot,” snapped Slazeck. “Or, to 
be more accurate, 1 think the Red 
Spot’s found us. Didn’t you say it 
turned more slowly than the band 
we’re in?” 

“By about five minutes.” 

“Yeah well it’s bigger than we 
are, you could say it’s running us 
down. Mac, we got some star sights 
during the night; I made our speed 
nearly thirty thousand miles an 
hour. Subtracting Jupiter’s spin 
and our airspeed leaves us in a sev- 
en-hundred-mile-per-hour jet- 
stream. Adding the Spot’s veloci- 
ty to that puts us in big trouble!” 

Lrom this altitude their Jovian 
horizon had been seven hundred 
miles away. Now a rolling yellow 
stormwall was coming in from 
the right, cutting across their path 
at an ever sharper angle. Unsta- 
ble layers of ice formed and dis- 
persed in it. Lightning flickered 
all along it like an electric cur- 
tain. As Slazeck said, they were 
bearing down on it at nearly two 
thousand miles an hour. 

“With the jets out we can’t make 
enough speed in this gravity to get 
away from that,” McKay agreed. 
“Can we get enough height to see 
over it?” 

“Not a chance. We’re near our 
ceiling now.” 

“If we knew there was a clear 



166 



GALAXY 




vortex beyond, over the Spot it- 
self, we might try to project the 
ship over the storm belt,” said Mc- 
Kay. “But not knowing, we might 
well come down right in the worst 
of it.” 

“The wind may carry us around 
the outside,” said Devlin. “The 
Jetstream just might bank north 
around the storm wall as the lower 
layers are banking over the Spot.” 
“Then again a freak eddy might 
spin us right in there,” said Sla- 
zeck. “Mac, I’ve plumb lost inter- 
est in taking the ship into that.” 
“The Spot’s thirty thousand 
miles by seven thousand,” said 
McKay. “It’s like trying to out- 
fly the Earth. I think we’d better 
turn around in this airstream, if 
we can. That’ll give help about an- 
other three hours to find us; if not, 
better hope the wind sweeps us 
around.” 

“Take that real slow, Mac.” 
“You bet.” Taking over from 
Devlin, McKay began to bank 
with slight left rudder. The ship 
didn’t like it at all. 

“This must be the biggest drift 
in the history of aviation,” said 
Devlin. “Hey, look at those con- 
trails blow!” 

W HEN the ship was heading in- 
to the wind it felt less like a 
chip in the current, but the jets 
were only just beating it. System 
1 was lapping the Spot at 250 
mph, and they couldn’t fight that 
as well. With the Spot astern but 



drawing steadily nearer, the im- 
pression that it was overtaking 
them was inescapable. 

“Do you really think we’ll be 
found in time, Mac?” 

“I think there’s a very good 
chance, Cathy. We’ve been down 
here nearly eight hours; the Fal- 
laran must know we’re in trouble. 
We’ve just come out of darkness 
and for a short while our contrail 
will have been in sunlight with the 
clouds still in darkness. If I had to 
search for a ship lost in the Jovian 
atmosphere. I’d concentrate my 
search on the terminator. Our res- 
cue call’s on automatic. The ship 
will tell us at once if anyone an- 
swers.” 

The storm wall grew more terri- 
fying as it drew nearer. Condi- 
tions below it, where the atmos- 
pheric currents were climbing up 
the hidden face of the Spot, de- 
fied imagination. An endless 250 
mph tidal wave — the atmosphere 
below had to be nearly as dense as 
Earth’s oceans. Driven by the 
wind, were the clouds rolling up 
into surf as the “shore”- the ris- 
ing curve of a world-sized 
body — grew shallow under them? 

“If the Spot’s so big,” said 
Cathy, “I’m surprised we can’t see 
the top of it over those clouds.” 

“The Red Spot’s prominence 
has changed a lot in the centuries 
it’s been under observation,” 
said McKay. “It’s ranged from 
brick jed to a faint gray. It must be 
riding lower right now — ”

“Radar contact, Mac.” 

The alert was superfluous since 
they were all fully plugged 
in — McKay had shared the detec- 
tion of the echo. Another ship 
had come over the horizon ahead. 
It had to be on a suborbital tra- 
jectory; an orbit so close to the 
planet would have sped it across 
the sky very fast indeed. McKay’s 
first surge of hope dimmed; the 
stranger wasn’t big enough to be a 
Furtherance warship. 

“Mac,” Slazeck asked, “do you 
consider that ship may be one of 
the enemy?” 

“It could be, Walt. The expedi- 
tion does have some probes for the 
Jovian atmosphere, but if they’d 
detected us down here. I’d have 
expected a warship to come 
down.” 

“All our armament is gone ex- 
cept for four clumps of anti-mis- 
siles. Evasion maneuvers in this 
airstream and gravity will be pre- 
carious, especially with so little 
height to hack around in.” 

“We need help in any case — the 
Spot will be on us in another 
hour. Our radio call stays on.” 
“And pray the ship’s one of 
ours,” Devlin added. 

Near the peak of its trajectory, 
the other ship was climbing slow- 
ly up the sky over them. It was al- 
most overhead when the radio 
suddenly came to life. 

“Acknowledge,” McKay told 
the computer. “That’s Kiliath’s 
personal call.” 



A BRIGHT flare of rocket ex- 
haust broke from the speck 
above them. Its trajectory brok- 
en, down the ship came, past the 
faint disks of Ganymede and 
Europa. 

“Kiliath was in enemy hands,” 
Devlin reminded McKay ur- 
gently. “This may be a trap.” 
McKay glanced again at the on- 
coming fury of the storm. “If it is, 
we’ll bite.” He opened the speech 
channel. “Kiliath, what is your 
condition?” 

“I am well, friend McKay,” 
said the flat computer-transla- 
tion. “The Jackals told me, during 
interrogation, that they had con- 
signed your ship to the Jovian 
depths. I thought they underesti- 
mated the REV and that I might 
return past favors.” 

“We’re damn glad to see you. 
I’ll tell you that. How did you get 
away from the A1 Tanrai?” 

“They underestimated the Eal- 
laran as well as mankind and 
your ship. I could move more free- 
ly down in Jupiter’s deeps than 
their android slaves. I concealed 
the fact and they left only two 
guards over me while the rest of the 
crew were put into suspended ani- 
mation. Eventually their rela- 
tive paralysis gave me an oppor- 
tunity and I fell upon them.” 

Some time, thought McKay, I 
must ask Kiliath for a demon- 
stration of his high-gravity 
strength. That he’s here now is a 
good enough demonstration for 



168

the moment. Kiliath’s ship was 
coming down into the atmos- 
phere, planing toward them 
across the great sea of clouds. Mc- 
Kay realized that the ship was no 
Fallaran design. 

“Is that a Jackal ship, Kiliath?” 

“The kind they use for deep pen- 
tration into giant worlds, friend 
McKay. As soon as 1 broke the 
planet’s surface I followed your 
line of flight.” 

“Then there are still no Inter- 
face relays within range of the 
planet?” 

“I can find none. This ship, of 
course, has the Jackal drive; but 
with full tanks your RLV could get 
within range of the lo satellite.” 

The computer translation 
didn’t always preserve trains of 
thought going from ET speech to 
English, but McKay had plenty 
of non sequitur practice. “Our 
tanks are empty, Kiliath. Do I 
understand that you can refuel 
us?” 

“I believe so, friend McKay. 
This ship refuels itself in flight in 
the denser layers of the atmos- 
phere. And there are ship-to-ship 
systems for transfer to more 
lightly built spaceships.” 

V 

T he usual Jackal ships were 
conventional rocket shapes, 
quite slender, with the high-pres- 
sure tank for the group-mind ele- 
ments at the thickest part of the 



hull. The ship now closing with the 
RLV was like a squat, solid version 
of the Fallaran supply ships; coni- 
cal hull, delta wings sweeping 
back from near its nose, much less 
lifting surface than the RLV even 
at its full sweep. Its color was the 
faded black of a well-worn bowl- 
ing ball. There was no time to find 
out if its fuel was the same as the 
RLV’s, but if it would flash into 
incandescent plasma, going 
through the fusion pile, it should 
work. Kiliath came up behind the 
RLV, trailing a refueling boom 
and McKay opened the intake 
slot on top of the ship. 

“Can you modify the Jackal 
probe to fit that?” 

“Its shape can be modified for 
transfer to different types of ves- 
sel. I think I can match the RLV’s 
inlet.” 

After two or three tries they had 
a good contact. Fuel began to 
flow between the two ships. 

“Do you find that ship easy to 
fly?” asked Slazeck. 

“The controls are laid out for 
humanoid operators,” Kiliath 
reported. “Their perception cir- 
cuits, unlike yours or ours, use the 
sense of touch extensively, but 
they can be mastered.” 

“You mean you can feel tem- 
peratures and stresses directly?” 
“To some extent. Mainly one 
can feel the operation of internal 
systems, as if rocket motors 
could be part of one’s own body. 
Damage to the ship must produce 



GALILEAN PROBLEM

a sense of shock and loss, if not ac- 
tual pain.” 

A sudden turbulence shook the 
RLV, but McKay managed to 
keep the link with Kiliath. The 
storm front before the Red Spot 
was now much too close for com- 
fort. 

“Our tanks are nearly full,” 
McKay radioed. “I’m setting up 
a return trajectory to lo. Will you 
have enough fuel now to get 
away?” 

“No, I must drop again into 
denser layers to scoop in more 
hydrogen. However this ship is 
better able to cope with turbu- 
lence. You must escape at once.” 

The two ships swung apart, Kili- 
ath’s descending steeply toward 
pressure layers the RLV couldn’t 
enter. 

T he familiar blue flame erupted 
below, a sun at its center, a wa- 
terfall at its edge. The RLV 
climbed steadily out into space, 
across the huge world-within-a- 
world of the Red Spot. Beyond the 
storm wall great shockwaves 
streamed back, breaking eventu- 
ally from the curve of the Spot in- 
to hurricane eddies. The RLV 
was a space vehicle again, on tra- 
jectory in a black sky. 

McKay saw no need to make the 
point that they had enough fuel to 
reach lo, but not enough to catch 
it — lo was farther from Jupiter 
than the Moon from Earth, but 
went around it in forty-two and a 



half hours. If for any reason they 
couldn’t connect with the Inter- 
face relay up there, they would be 
coming back to Jupiter at the 
speed they now left it. 

More immediate to McKay was 
the worry about Kiliath. The 
RLV was well out from the planet 
before the A1 Tanrai ship fol- 
lowed its path across the Red Spot. 
On full drive the Jackal ship could 
have made it to lo in seconds, but 
Kiliath doubted his own preci- 
sion with the strange controls over 
such short distances. He was con- 
tent to trail the RLV, slowly over- 
hauling it as lo’s disk moved into 
their path. 

McKay made radio contact 
with the expedition as interfer- 
ence from Jupiter fell off. The 
alarm had been raised for the shut- 
tle and the RLV hours ago, of 
course, but the shuttle trap had 
been worked from Amalthea, the 
innermost moon, and it had tak- 
en time to get an Interface relay 
down there and make safe the ap- 
proaches to the planet. Trying to 
hold Amalthea had cost the A1 
Tanrai several ships: between 
the Interface weapon itself (it 
faced into the vicinity of blue 
stars and other things equally un- 
pleasant) and the heavy bom- 
bardment of the Furtherance 
warships, they had lost heavily. 

After the tension of the past 
hours McKay found it wonderful 
to leave attitude control to the 
autopilot, to open the accelera- 



170 



GALAXY 




tion shields (from the ridiculous 
2.64G to the sublime of weight- 
lessness), clean up and cook a de- 
cent meal. The closed shield over 
the android’s body was a grim re- 
minder that the mission wasn’t 
over, but right now they could un- 
wind. The two ships floated out to- 
ward the Galilean moons, with- 
out incident and when lo filled 
the sky McKay acquired the or- 
bital relay. 

“Our worries are over,” he told 
Kiliath moments later. “I’ve 
converted into stable orbit 
around the moon. Are you going 
to rendezvous with us or try for a 
landing?” 

“A landing might be best,” said 
Kiliath’s translation. “I am still 
unsure of the drive settings and it 
seems easier to bring the ship to 
rest and lower it on rocket 
thrust.” 

“Okay, Kiliath. We’ll stand by 
for you.” McKay moved the ship 
back along its orbit in order to be 
well placed when Kiliath made his 
approach. He was still burning 
tail-first at minimal thrust 
through each Interface, in case 
the Jackal bugs were still active. 

Decelerating, the captured 
Jackal ship fell past him. The 
tricky approach seemed good at 
first, but Kiliath was going down 
too fast. 

“Correcting risks overcontrol- 
ling,” Kiliath’s channel said. 
“Friend McKay, could you set an 
Interface to slow this ship?” 



“I’ll give you one to subtract 
two thousand feet a second,” said 
McKay. “You should be able to 
catch it on the rocket from there.” 
On the RLV’s display, he watched 
glowing lines trace the Interface 
ahead of Kiliath. Since he was on- 
ly losing speed, not going else- 
where or even changing height, the 
Interface was invisible — all he 
saw through it was the face of the 
moon as before. As the ship went 
through, he wondered if Kiliath 
should have used rockets first to 
be on the safe side. Surely the 
Jackal bugs wouldn’t attack their 
own ships . 

Why not? Jackal ships weren’t 
expected to go through Interface 
at all! 

“Friend McKay,” said the com- 
puter translation, tone still neu- 
tral but hesitancy implying emo- 
tion, “I am losing external visual 
sensors — ” 

“We’re on our way!” Fully 
plugged in, McKay had only to 
give the ship one order to bring all 
systems up to rescue alert. Lock 
on the descending ship. Inter- 
face to match its path, motor on 
low burn — and they were along- 
side Kiliath, falling slowly toward 
the ice fields of lo. 

“You’re still in drive attitude, 
nose down,” McKay radioed. 
“Do you have attitude control?” 

“Nominally yes — the textual 
perceptions are still effective.” 

“Okay, we’ll talk you around. 
Take it in the pitch axis, say ten de- 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



171 




grees a second. We’ve got plenty 
of time.” 

McKay called off the turn as the 
triangular silhouette pivoted 
against the spreading face of the 
moon. With plenty of warning, 
Kiliath killed the turn when the 
ship was nose up. 

“That’s fine, start slowing her. 
Hold that attitude.” The two 
ships’ motors lit together, slow- 
ing their descent still further. Mc- 
Kay was thinking ahead to the 
tricky talk-down to the Fallaran 
base. 

“Friend McKay — ” The trans- 
lation halted again, unable to 
speak an exclamation mark. “In- 
ternal sensors are now going out.” 

“So are your motors! There 
must be a safety cutoff when the 
pilot loses touch. Is there no auto- 
matic control?” 

“None I can locate.” Both ships 
were falling unpowered now, in 
order to stay together. They 
were descending at a slight angle 
to the ice plain. Acceleration 
was fortunately slow in this 
gravity. 

“What reaction controls do 
you have left? Attitude?” 

“Attitude control and horizon- 
tal thrusters for docking.” 

“Okay. We’ve lost most of our 
vertical component of velocity, 
it’s about equal to the horizontal. 
You’re going to hit at about nine- 
ty feet a second. Activate pitch and 
yaw controls and take her around 
to starboard. Keep it slow.” 



Without telling Kiliath, Mc- 
Kay was leaving him to fall. He 
had to continue the RLV retro- 
fire. Motor flaring on primary 
boost, the RLV drew slowly up 
and back. 

“Kill your yaw motion — that’s 
fine. You’re coming up to the 
pitch angle you want — kill it! 
Okay, you’re lined up and going in 
fast. Hit those lateral thrusters. 
Impact’s about twenty seconds 
away. You’re shedding speed. 
Drop the nose, go for the full cush- 
ioning effect. Cut the thrusters — 
now!” 

T he RLV drifted upright on low 
thrust as Kiliath’s ship hit, 
bounced, hit again, became en- 
veloped in a cloud of ice and 
ploughed in. Nothing could be 
seen or heard. McKay came down 
nearby, tilting the ship to kill the 
horizontal component. On the 
dimmer flame of the chemical 
motors he backed down on the tail 
landing blocks. Stabilizer booms 
snapped out from them. 

The two hemispheres of ice crys- 
tals, one from the RLV motors, a 
much larger one over the Kiliath 
crash, spread slowly in the low-G 
vacuum, each crystal on its own 
distinct trajectory. Opaque at 
first, the clouds thinned, glitter- 
ing, sinking and flattening like a 
depth-charge effect reversed. Still 
Kiliath didn’t answer the radio. 

“We’ll have to get over there,” 
said McKay, beginning to rise. 



172 



GALAXY 




“You can’t go,” said Slazeck. 
“Whoever goes out there will be 
grounded for months — and as 
Earth’s Planetary Agent you can’t 
be spared.” 

“What’s the problem?” Cathy 
asked. 

“Radiation,” McKay said 
briefly. “lo’s in the most intense 
layer of Jupiter’s radiation 
belts. Its movements have quite an 
effect on the natural radio sig- 
nals from the planet. Our shield- 
ing’s full on, but whoever goes for 
Kiliath will only have a spacesuit.” 

“As least experienced. I’m 
least valuable,” said Devlin. “I’ll 
get Kiliath out.” 

“You’re a married man, Dev, 
and there’s no such thing as a trivi- 
al radiation dose — not that this 
one is going to be trivial. I think 
this one’s mine, Mac.” 

McKay nodded. “Second time 
this mission. Good luck again, 
Walt.” 

Except in training, this was the 
first time they’d had the ship up- 
right. Slazeck went down, hand 
over hand, to what was normally 
the rear wall of the cabin, opening 
what was now the floor hatch into 
the airlock. Once again in the full 
spacesuit, he evacuated the lock 
and opened the outer door. 

With the ship standing on its tail 
the rescue systems were harder 
to use. The outer door, normally 
a ramp to the ground, was now 
over Slazeck’s head like an awn- 
ing. McKay had to drop the 



stretcher unit on a cable to the 
lock and Slazeck had to extend 
the new lock floor as a platform, 
step out, and pull the sled over. The 
systems could adapt to almost 
any rescue situation, but all 
adaptations could not be equally 
convenient. 

Slazeck started the jets, turning 
the sled on the platform to point at 
Kiliath’s ship. In this low gravity 
it took only a little power to set 
him gliding out over the ice plain. 

Leaving the ship in that frozen 
landscape was one of the loneliest 
experiences Slazeck had ever 
imagined. As soon as he left the 
shadow of the outer door Jupiter 
dominated him, ruling the sky 
overhead. Its light probed every 
crack and hollow in the ice field 
below; in a black sky, it was like 
incredible, brilliant moonlight. 

B ack in the RLV, McKay 
watched him go like a slow, 
straight arrow toward the wreck. 
In a corner of the visual field the 
computer traced the ebb and flow 
of the radiation scouring the 
face of the moon. Slazeck would 
have to stay out of space for 
months after this to keep down his 
exposure for the year. McKay 
had all the scanners extended, the 
ship on full defense alert — for 
where were the A1 Tanrai all this 
time? If they came over while the 
ship was on the icefield, better go 
radar-invisible and hope they 
didn’t cast too long a shadow. 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



173 




The same thought had occurred 
to Slazeck. “Mac, if you’re at- 
tacked while I’m out here, you 
blast off and protect yourselves. 
I’ll shelter in the Jackal ship till 
you can come back.’’ 

“Unless we’re seen, it would be 
best to lie low,” McKay replied. 
“We’ve nothing but some anti- 
missiles left. You just get Kiliath 
out of there.” 

They were only twenty miles 
from the expedition base, but 
nothing there was better suited 
for the rescue than the RLV it- 
self. McKay would have liked a 
Furtherance warship over them 
for cover. 

He lost touch with Slazeck 
when the latter entered the Jack- 
al ship. Devlin was suited up, 
ready to follow him across with 
more equipment if necessary — it 
would be worth grounding anoth- 
er member of the team to cut Sla- 
zeck’s exposure, if Kiliath had to 
be cut out. But Slazeck reap- 
peared in a few minutes, lower- 
ing the Furtherance officer on 
to the stretcher. 

“I think he’s only stunned,” 
Slazeck reported. “No bones 
broken, anyway. The sled can 
bring us both back in this gravity.” 
“What’s it like in there?” Mc- 
Kay asked as the stretcher unit 
lifted from the wreck. “The dam- 
age doesn’t look bad from here.” 
“There’s not much in there to be 
thrown about. It’s completely aus- 
tere, functional — bare metal — ” 



That figured, McKay was 
thinking: without thoughts of 
their own the androids needed 
nothing for comfort or stimu- 
lus — but the rest of Slazeck’s de- 
scription was drowned by crash- 
ing waves of radio interference. 

A t the touch of a switch the 
radar-baffling system went 
on — the electronic disturbance 
was caused by Jackal ships com- 
ing out of FTL drive. The sensors 
pinned the shockwaves to a small 
patch of sky, confirming their ori- 
entation toward. lo. Moments 
later McKay detected the ships 
themselves, coming in very fast 
indeed, not far above the Ecliptic. 
Slazeck and Kiliath were half- 
way back across the icefield, head- 
ing straight for the open airlock. 
He couldn’t do anything — but he 
didn’t need to. 

McKay had seen Interface 
conflict before, when the Sasa- 
renn were expelled from the 
Earth-Moon system, but that had 
been a huge and complex battle. 
In this situation he had a better 
chance to appreciate Interface 
tactics. Obviously the Further- 
ance ships were conducting a 
textbook maneuver. What hap- 
pened proved the superiority of 
rocket ships, with Interface, to 
the Jackal spacedrive. The thir- 
teen ships of the squadron ap- 
peared around the Jackals, fired 
and were elsewhere, again and 
again. The thirteen ships, consid- 



174

ered as missile platforms, be- 
came twenty-six, thirty-nine, fif- 
ty-two, sixty-five . Doing it 
backward, with motors at low 
thrust to burn the bugs away, they 
made the deadly combat more 
like an aerobatic display. The 
Jackal formation was englobed 
in a converging web of missile 
trails, so many at so many differ- 
ent angles that every evasive ac- 
tion was forestalled. The relative- 
ly high speed of the A1 Tanrai sim- 
ply elongated the pattern. The 
web completed itself with the 
Jackal ships at its foci, and ex- 
panding fireclouds blotted out the 
trails. In their first serious en- 
counter with the Interface, the 
Cosmic Jackals had flown 
straight into one of the Fallaran 
classics. 

Kiliath was beginning to come 
around by the time they brought 
his stretcher in through the rescue 
hatch. They got his helmet off, 
prepared various aids to recov- 
ery prescribed by the medic 
tapes — and by the time the fleet 
had made orbit and a shuttle was 
coming for him, Kiliath was well 
enough to tell his story. 

“The A1 Tanrai have to take on 
ballast to get their ships deep into 
Jupiter’s atmosphere. At ex- 
treme depths the fuel tanks pro- 
vide lift; the ship becomes a bathy- 
scaph. It is very still down there, 
far below the storms; there may be 
currents, but there are no points of 
reference to reveal them. The 



solid core of the planet is still so 
far below that soundings cannot 
reach it. Nothing indicates a uni- 
verse above. Until the humanoids 
reached them in their own world, 
the A1 Tanrai must have thought 
themselves the absolute lords of 
creation. They open their pres- 
sure tanks and float free of the 
ships, like huge jellyfish. 

“As 1 told you, they put most of 
their androids into hibernation 
when they go down into the high 
gravity. I broke free and over- 
powered the two remaining; then 
I closed the pressure tank and jet- 
tisoned all ballast. With the pres- 
sure section empty, rising at 
maximum speed, I could not be 
overtaken; but I left missiles 
floating at higher levels to stop 
pursuit. Even if the motors did 
not work, the warheads would ex- 
plode on proximity, making great 
concussion waves. On the sur- 
face, more explosions would 
never be noticed.” 

McKay nodded grimly. “There 
doesn’t seem to be any common 
ground with such creatures. The 
way they keep taking specimens. 
I’m sure they’re looking for new 
servants.” 

“There can never be compati- 
bility with them,” said Kiliath. 
The flat voice from the cabin 
speaker was hesitating as the 
computer failed to express emo- 
tional meaning. “They will op- 
pose the spread of the Interface 
into the regions they control.” 



GALILEAN PROBLEM 



175 




Kiliath’s eyes were incredibly 
bright between their skin folds. 
‘‘"Nothing must interfere with the 
Interface. Furtherance must 
overcome every obstacle.” 

T here wasn’t room in the 
REV cabin, particularly with 
the ship upright, but McKay had 
a strong impulse to back away. 
Again, as with the Sasarenn, the 
Eallaran were creating an en- 
emy — advancing the Interface 
at whatever risk to the worlds and 
races in its path. Their dedication 
was much too strong to contest. 
What, he wondered, could have 
been their original motivation? 

“Here comes the shuttle, Mac,” 
said Devlin. 

The little ship burned down only 
yards from the REV. Kiliath was 
lowered from the lock and taken 
across to safety. 

“Do you have enough fuel to 
leave here?” he asked McKay by 
radio. 

“Just enough. We’ll go through 
Interface to the Earth satellite; 
refuel, rearm, take Walt down to 
Montana. Give us a day’s rest and 
we’ll be back.” 

“Goodbye then, friend Mc- 
Kay.” The shuttle took off, climb- 
ing away to join the orbiting fleet. 

“Well, that’s that for the mo- 
ment,” said Devlin. 

There was a feeling of anticli- 
max. 

“For the moment.’’ McKay 



climbed back to the cockpit as the 
others settled on their couches. 
Systems check; close radiation 
bulkheads and acceleration shields. 
“Let’s go home, children.” 

The ship rose on the chemical 
motors in a cloud of ice and fire; a 
short brilliant burst on the fusion 
motor set it climbing toward a 
safe Interface altitude. 

They were coasting straight to- 
wards the banded globe of Jupiter, 
as if — heaven forbid! — they were 
going back there. 

“That’s going to be our head- 
ache,” said McKay, gazing at the 
planet. “Supposedly there’s to be 
joint human-Fallaran exploita- 
tion of the Jupiter system, with 
first the supplies, later the ships 
and equipment, coming from 
Earth — a big lift for our space 
technology. But there may still be 
A1 Tanrai down there, coming up 
to raid us. As a group-mind, they 
can communicate on and from 
Jupiter where we can’t. And more 
of their ships can dive in from 
space to reinforce them. An In- 
terface relay has a range of ten 
thousand miles and costs a plan- 
et’s ransom — how many would you 
need to blockade a planet that 
size?” 

No one spoke. 

“That’s a closed world to us, 
that we were lucky to get off the 
roof of,” McKay said ungram- 
matically. “How could we tell, for 
instance, if they found allies down 
there?”
