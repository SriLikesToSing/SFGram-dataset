there an intangible bond with the uni-

That’s How It Goes 



It’s easy to get Aperdui. A phone call at the wrong moment 
— a meal too many — a screen star wearing too many 
clothes . It's easy. And it's fun . 



By j. t. McIntosh Illustrated by Ritter 



I 

T HE four censors watched 
the takes in silence. When 
the lights came on in the 
small projection room, the 
Second Censor said to the 
First Censor: “You’re quite 
right. It’s not merely undesir- 
ably sexy, in fact obscene — 
there’s not even an attempt 
at an excuse for it. Now if the 
subject of the film had been 
historical, or if the climate 
had been such that — ” 

“A clear case,” said the 
Third Censor briskly. “I have 

6 



the names of the actress, pro- 
ducer, director, script-writer 
and cameramen here. Shall I 
send them all on to the Trans- 
portation Board?” 

“If you like,” said the First 
Censor. “But the producer, di- 
rector, script-writer and cam- 
eramen will wriggle out of it. 
They always do. I guess you’d 
save everybody trouble if you 
just send the actress to the 
Transportation Board.” 

“I guess so,” the Third Cen- 
sor agreed. “Okay, Sandra 
Kay goes before the Board to- 
morrow. I’ll attend to the de- 





tails. Now let’s see that last 
take again.” 

The beautiful blonde in the 
transparent nightdress smiled 
seductively at them again, un- 
dulating even as she lay on a 
couch. 

“Funny how movies used to 
be cut when the girls wore too 
few clothes,” the Second Cen- 
sor mused. “Obviously this is 
only obscene because she’s 
wearing that promiscuous 
garment. When she takes it 
off later, the whole thing be- 
comes perfectly respectable.” 

There was silence until San- 
dra Kay had finished cavort- 
ing about the screen. Then 
the Third Censor said: “Just 
to be quite sure we aren’t 
making any mistake about 
this, let’s see that again, 
huh?” 

64V70U haven’t even an ex- 

1 cuse?” the overseer per- 
sisted. 

Johnny Horne shrugged. 
“Well, it seems a little thing, 
working through the break. 
I've done it before, and knock- 
ed off early.” 

“Yes, but this time you 
didn’t knock off early. A little 
thing, indeed! Do you realize 
that you produced three hun- 
dred pairs of shoes above quo- 
ta? What are we going to do 
with those three hundred pairs 
of shoes? Don’t you know that 
as it is we’ve got a million 
salesmen trying to increase 
demand so that we can unload 
our surplus stocks? And you 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



casually produce an extra 
three hundred pairs of shoes 
just because you didn’t feel 
like taking time off for a glass 
of milk and a smoke !” 

“I . like working,” said 
Johnny naively. 

The overseer went purple. 
“You like working! When the 
police bring in a man on a 
homicide charge, does it do 
him any good to say ‘I like 
killing?’ Sure, you like work- 
ing! Haven’t you ever heard 
that Earth’s Balance Must Be 
Preserved? How can Earth’s 
Balance Preserved h irre- 
sponsible youngsters like you 
insist on making three hun- 
dred pairs of shoes above quo- 
ta?” 

“I won’t do it again.” 
“Darn right you won’t. I 
like you, Johnny, but this isn’t 
the first time something like 
this has happened. I’m send- 
ing your name to the Trans- 
portation Board.” 

Johnny was aghast. “You 
don’t mean it? Just for mak- 
ing a few pairs of shoes above 
quota?” 

The overseer raised his eyes 
to heaven. “Obviously you 
don’t understand, Johnny, and 
never will understand. That’s 
why you’re going before the 
Board tomorrow.” 

T T TBBY BROOKS sighed 
contentedly. “That sure 
was a feed,” he said. “Boy, do 
I like French cooking!” 

Kate was draining the last 
drop of coffee. They were a 

7 




strange pair. They looked as 
if they could have nothing in 
common. Tubby weighed 230 
pounds, and he was not quite 
five feet five. His little round 
face was almost hidden by 
folds of fat, but in the mid- 
dle of the roundness could be 
discerned two little round 
eyes, a little round nose and a 
little round mouth. Kate 
weighed less than 100 pounds, 
and she was five feet eight. 
She was a broomstick with 
two small bumps on it. 

The truth was they shared 
quite a lot, including a bed, 
although they had never got 
around to marriage. Princi- 
pally they had gluttony in 
common. They had the same 
view of heaven — a place 
where it was possible to eat 
all day and most of the night. 

Earth was not heaven. No 
fantastically crowded world 
could be rich in food. Though 
there was no actual rationing, 
Earth was no paradise for 
people who liked to top off a 
six-course meal with forty- 
two hamburgers for filling. 

However, they coped with 
the situation fairly well. 

They left the restaurant 
and Tubby hailed a cab. He 
didn’t give their final destina- 
tion ; he was too wily for that. 
He named a neutral, unim- 
portant spot and paid off the 
cabbie when they reached it. 
Another taxi took them to 
Bertini’s. 

“We haven’t been here for 
at least three weeks,” Kate 

8 



murmured. “I’ve almost for- 
gotten what Italian food 
tastes like. Let’s start with 
ham and melon, and then have 
spaghetti a la Bolognese.” 

They couldn’t have dessert; 
nobody was ever supplied with 
more than two courses. 

Twenty minutes later Tub- 
by sighed contentedly. “That 
sure was a feed,” he said. 
“Boy, do I like Italian cook- 
ing!” 

From Bertini’s they walked 
to the Metropole, Kate skip- 
ping like a bird as she al- 
ways did. Tubby breasting the 
traffic like an aircraft carrier. 
It was a long way, and they 
were famished when they 
arrived. 

“Chicken Maryland,” Tub- 
by decided. 

He never got it. Suddenly 
there were three cops around 
them. Tubby blinked at them 
doubtfully. 

One had a notebook. “Okay, 
Buster,” he said. “Explain 
this. First you ate at the Grill. 
Then at the Paris Soir. Then 
at Bertini’s. Now you’re here. 
What do you think you are — 
two sacks of loot on legs?” 

They couldn’t explain it. At 
least, Tubby did explain it, 
tearfully and sincerely, but 
the cops had no sympathy 
with the plain, unvarnished 
truth: “We were hungry.” 

T OM C A M M added the 
fourth nutrient solution to 
the culture in the tank, watch- 
ing it carefully. The culture 

j. t. McIntosh 




sometimes got sick, just like 
human digestion, and had to 
be drained promptly. 

Hie phone rang. Tom look- 
ed at it, puzzled, shrugged and 
went over to pick it up. If a 
call was switched through to 
him while he was engaged in 
such critical work, it must be 
important. 

“Tom?” 

“Joan ! How in hell did you 
get the girl on the switch- 
board to put your call 
through?” 

“I told her it was a matter 
of life and death, which it is. 
Tom, we’ve got to get married 
right away !” 

“You mean . 

She giggled. “No, I don’t 
mean that. I mean we’re get- 
ting a two-room flat. We move 
in before next Tuesday !” 

“Joan, that’s great! Most 
couples have to wait years. 
How did you . .” Sudden sus- 
picion sharpened his voice. 
“You didn’t . ?” 

“No, I didn’t, and you 
should be ashamed of yourself 
for thinking such a thing. I 
guess it must be a mistake, 
but they won’t put us out if 
we get married and move in 
right away. So we’ve got to 
get married the moment you 
leave the laboratories to- 
night.” 

“Sure, Joan. Gee. this is 
great news ! This must be my 
lucky day.” 

He wasn’t quite so sure 
about that half an hour later, 
on the carpet before his boss. 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



“It’s incredible, Camm, ab- 
solutely incredible. It wouldn’t 
have surprised me if a young 
technician had done it, but 
that you should stand casually 
talking on the phone to your 
girl friend while behind you 
a whole vat of culture died . 
Camm, I can still hardly be- 
lieve it.” 

“What Joan had to tell me, 
sir, was — ” 

“It doesn’t matter one tenth 
of a damn what the girl was 
telling you! The moment you 
realized a private „ call had 
been switched to you at a 
critical stage in the process, 
you should have hung up. If 
you’d done that, it would have 
been possible to save the vat.” 

Tom considered making an- 
other appeal, but he knew it 
was no good. Finally he said 
simply: “Yes, sir. You’re 

sending me to the Transpor- 
tation Board?” 

“Not only you, Camm, but 
the girl on the switchboard 
who let that call through and 
the girl who made it. I’m sor- 
ry Camm. But on a world as 
overcrowded as Earth is, a 
vat of synthetic food is worth 
more than the same vat filled 
with gold, platinum and ura- 
nium.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Tom. He 
was resigned. 

It was the end of every- 
thing, of course. If Joan 
agreed, they’d spend this 
night together and then kiH 
themselves before the inter- 
view with the Board. 



9 




u 

T HE next morning seven 
people collected in a gloomy 
waiting-room at Transporta- 
tion House. 

There was Sandra Kay, the 
young, beautiful but not yet 
famous actress who had of- 
fended the censors by wearing 
too much. 

She would never become fa- 
mous now. 

There was Johnny Horne, 
who liked work so much that 
he had made three hundred 
pairs of shoes above quota. If 
he didn't know by now that 
the Balance Must Be Preserv- 
ed, Earth had no further use 
for him. 

There were Tubby Brooks 
and Kate Rimmer, who had 
tried to get more than their 
fair share of an overcrowded 
world’s most vital commodity 
— food. 

There was Tom Camm, 
whose negligence had resulted 
in something just as serious — 
the destruction of food. Joan 
Liverage, his accomplice in 
crime. Sylvia Oliver, another 
accomplice in the same hein- 
ous crime. 

Joan, who had not agreed to 
commit suicide with Tom, kept 
well out of the switchboard 
girl’s way. She might easily 
become violent. 

The middle-aged secretary 
looked them over indifferently 
and sent Sandra Kay in first. 
Her boss would never forgive 
her if she delayed his making 

10 



the acquaintance of a gor- 
geous creature like that by as 
much as a second. 

Sandra Kay looked at the 
little brown-faced man behind 
the desk, threw off her fur 
cape and sat down, crossing 
her legs so that from where 
he was sitting he couldn’t see 
her skirt at all. Inwardly boil- 
ing with anger, she knew it 
would do her no good at all to 
show it. 

“Mr. Rawlings?” she said, 
smiling dazzlingly. 

Rawlings had brightened 
the moment she entered the 
room.He scrabbled among the 
papers on his desk. Ah, yes, 
this must be the actress, San- 
dra Kay. 

“Miss Kay,” he said, “the 
charge against you is that you 
appeared in an obscene film. 
More particularly, that you 
wore erotic and unnecessary 
garments.” 

“Just one,” said Sandra. “A 
nightdress. Nothing else.” 

“You admit the charge, 
then?” 

“I admit I wore a night- 
dress, yes. What’s wrong in 
that?” She smiled dazzingly 
at him again, but this time 
her smile was wasted, for he 
was looking at the sheet in 
front of him. 

“As an experienced actress, 
Miss Kay, you know what is 
permissible and what is not. 
I understand that it would 
have been all right if you 
wore a respectable, opaque 
nightdress or nothing at all, 

j. t. McIntosh 




but the kind of garment you 
wore has been ruled danger- 
ously provocative.” He looked 
her up and down. “This I can 
well imagine to be the case.” 

“Why, thank you, Mr. Raw- 
lings.” 

Rawlings coughed. “You 
have been sent here because 
you — ” 

“Now, just a minute, Mr. 
Rawlings. There has been no 
criminal charge against me, 
and if I were to stand trial I 
guess I’d have a chance of 
getting off. Why shouldn’t I 
just tell you to go to hell?” 

UT) ECAUSE you might not 

D get off. Miss Kay. In 
that case you would be sent to 
a tough, inhospitable, sparse- 
ly-populated criminal world 
such as Roc. Worlds like Roc 
will never be developed, ex- 
cept as criminal settlements. 
If you were sent there, you — 
even you — would have noth- 
ing to look forward to but a 
tough, unpleasant life and an 
early, unpleasant death. On 
the other hand, if you accept 
transportation here and now, 
you will go to Aperdui, a 
pleasant world right at the top 
of the list for development.” 

“Not Verdan or Mistan?” 

“Ah, Verdan.” Rawlings 
suddenly became wistful. “I 
spent twenty-five years in 
Verdan, and I can’t wait to 
get back. Most Transpbrtation 
officials are colonists, you 
know, Miss Kay. I tell you 
honestly, I can’t wait for my 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



term of duty here on Earth to 
be over so that I can return 
to Verdan.” 

“But I can’t go there?” 
“I’m afraid not. Verdan is 
now fully self-supporting, 
fully developed, able to popu- 
late itself without further 
need of immigrants. It’s off 
the list of Transportation 
worlds. So is Mistan. But 
Aperdui is a grand world.” 
“Population?” 

“Only a few thousand at 
the moment, but — ” 

“A hick world. No radio, 
television, cars, trucks, hospi- 
tals, cinemas, theaters, wash- 
ing machines, books, maga- 
zines, newspapers — ” 

“Now there you’re wrong, 
Miss Kay. There is a small 
emergency clinic, and a mime- 
ographed newspaper is pub- 
lished twice a week.” 

“Huh,” said Sandra. She 
caught Rawling’s eye and held 
it. “If I went for trial, tell me 
frankly, what would be my 
chances ?” 

“Frankly, Miss Kay, you 
probably wouldn’t get Roc. 
But you wouldn’t be allowed 
to stay on Earth either. You’d 
get Aperdui anyway.” 

“I see.” Sandra stood up. “I 
believe you.” 

Rawling’s eyes ran up her 
golden legs, caressed her hips, 
popped at her bust and finally 
reached her golden head, ex- 
hausted. 

Although he was a colonist, 
automatically placing the col- 
onies, any colony, before al- 
ii 




most everything else, what 
difference did just one colonist 
make? 

“In certain circumstances, 
Miss Kay,” he said, not meet- 
ing her eyes, “I might be per- 
suaded to recommend that you 
be allowed to stay on Earth.” 

She knew exactly what he 
meant. She knew what he 
meant better than he did. He 
meant that she could remain 
on Earth as his mistress until 
the relationship became tire- 
some, awkward or inconveni- 
ent for him, at which time 
easily the neatest solution 
would be to withdraw his pro- 
tection and have her sent to 
Aperdui to be out of the way. 

“Thanks, Mr. Rawlings” 
she said. “I sure appreciate 
that. I’ll take Aperdui.” 

R AWLINGS interviewed 
the other six one by one. 
None of them had even as 
good a chance of escaping 
transportation as Sandra. 

“I envy you,” he told Tubby 
Brooks bracingly. “Aperdui 
will make a man of you, my 
boy. In a few months you’ll 
be half your present weight. 
AH that fat will drop off, and 
you’ll become lean and hard 
and bronzed. If I were twenty- 
five years younger and didn’t 
have friends and relatives on 
Verdan, I’d be delisted to 
change places with you.” 
“What’s the food situation 
on Aperdui?” Tubby asked 
urgently. 

“Food? There’s enough, of 

12 



course. Aperdui has good agri- 
cultural land, excellent graz- 
ing . but then, you see, with 
the population snowballing as 
immigrants from Earth ar- 
rive, naturally there’s never 
any surplus. Every harvest 
has to provide for the present 
population plus the twenty 
thousand or so who will ar- 
rive before the next harvest. 
There’s enough food, my boy. 
But there’s never anything 
over.” 

Tubby groaned. 

So did Kate when she heard 
this grim news. Rawlings 
didn’t suggest to Kate that in 
certain circumstances he 
might be persuaded to recom- 
mend that she be allowed to 
stay on Earth. Too thin, he 
decided critically. 

Tom Camm listened in si- 
lence. He was probably the 
most intelligent of the seven, 
the one best able to exploit 
any loophole that might have 
existed. He was also, however, 
the one with the strongest 
case against him. Carelessness 
with food production on a 
world as desperately over- 
crowded as Earth was more 
than a misdemeanor. He was 
lucky, indeed, to get the 
chance of going to Aperdui. 
He might easily have been 
sent to Roc. 

Rawlings hesitated over 
Joan. She was thin too, and 
her mouth was too big. Her 
legs, however, were nearly as 
good as Sandra’s. In the end, 
not caring much one way or 

j. t. McIntosh 




the other, he gave her the 
chance. 

Joan considered it for quite 
a while. 

She very much wanted to 
remain on Earth. Everybody 
knew that life on the new 
colonies was hell. Earth never 
seemed like heaven until sud- 
denly you were faced with the 
prospect of leaving it for ever. 

She would lose Tom if she 
stayed, of course. Neverthe- 
less, she went on considering 
it. Finally she decided, how- 
ever, that if she took advan- 
tage of Rawling’s offer it 
probably wouldn’t be long un- 
til she was before the Trans- 
portation Board again for 
something else. And if that 
happened she would have lost 
Tom for nothing. 

She said she’d go to Aper- 
dui. 

Of the seven, only Johnny 
Horne could see anything in 
favor of Aperdui. “You mean 
I can work as hard as I like?’’ 
he said joyfully. 

Rawlings nodded. “From 
what I know of you, my boy, 
and from my own experiences 
on a planet like Aperdui, I 
should say you’ll probably be- 
come a very successful man. 
Not one of the richest men in 
the world, since as far as I 
can make out you’re too hon- 
est for that, but prettv com- 
fortable nevertheless. By the 
time you’re forty, when the 
rough edges of Aperdui will 
be smoothed out a little, I 
guess you’ll be a pretty im- 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



portant man out there.’’ 

“Maybe it won’t be so bad 
at that,” Johnny reflected. 

“It makes sense, my boy, 
that a man who works too 
hard on Earth should be sent 
to the colonies. That’s where 
a man who works hard ought 
to be. It’ll be years before 
there are any unions in Aper- 
dui, any upper-limit quotas, 
any problems of surplus pro- 
duction.” 

Johnny pondered. Already 
Sandra Kay, the kind of girl 
who would never have looked 
at him if they had both lived 
out their lives on Earth, was 
showing signs of interest in 
him. Sandra was a realist. It 
had taken her no time at all to 
readjust and see for herself, 
by more intuitive methods 
than Rawlings had used, that 
a strong, healthy, energetic, 
enthusiastic young man like 
Johnny Home was liable to 
accomplish a lot more on 
Aperdui than he could ever 
have done on Earth. 

“Maybe it won’t be so bad 
at that,” Johnny said at last. 

The telephone girl, Sylvia 
Oliver, came last . 

A fterwards. Rawlings 

delivered a little sermon. 
It was always much the same. 
At first he had tried to say 
something a little different 
each time, but at the hun- 
dredth repetition of what was 
essentially the same speech 
the words came out in a 
treacly flow as if he had turn- 



13 




ed the spigot on a barrel oi 
molasses. 

“I don’t want you to leave 
here laboring under a sense of 
injustice,” he said earnestly. 
“The plain fact is, Earth has 
to get rid of at least ten mil- 
lion people every year. Less 
than a tenth of that number 
emigrate voluntarily, despite 
all the publicity campaigns.” 

Tom cast an ironical glance 
at the poster on the wall be- 
side him. 

EMIGRATE! 

EMIGRATE NOW! 

A NEW LIFE AWAITS 
YOU! 

APERDUI IS A LAND OF 
PROMISE 

The girl in the picture was 
nearly as pretty as that 
blonde actress. Her eyes in- 
vited. Come to Aperdui and 
get me. See what’s waiting for 
you if you come to Aperdui. 
How could anybody be dumb 
enough not to want to come 
to Aperdui? 

But there was still, fortu- 
nately or unfortunately, a 
free press. People could read 
about Aperdui and Roc and 
Verdan and Mistan. They 
knew that the worlds the 
Transportation Board sent 
settlers to were always fron- 
tier worlds where a farm 
could be a million square miles 
and the nearest cinema could 
be twenty light-years away. 

Of course, if you were very 
lucky, you might be sent to a 

14 



wond like Verdan or Mistan 
just before transportation to 
that world stopped. Verdan 
was still sparsely populated— 
indeed, by Terran standards 
it was uninhabited. But Ver- 
dan was self-sufficient. That 
meant that Verdan had enough 
people on it to support fac- 
tories that made cars, electri- 
cal appliances and even such 
luxuries as bottles and mir- 
rors and shaving cream. 

It would be a long time be- 
fore Aperdui reached such a 
state. No wonder, Tom 
thought, that only a million 
idealistic idiots were taken in 
by the posters each year. 

“So more than nine million 
people have to be made to 
emigrate each year,” Raw- 
lings went on. “Preferably 
more. Twelve million would be 
best. It makes sense, doesn’t 
it? The colonies need these 
people desperately ; Earth des- 
perately needs to get rid of 
them. So — ” 

“So I get sent away,” Joan 
exclaimed, “for ringing up my 
fiance to tell him some good 
news.” 

Rawlings nodded. “Exactly. 
What I’m trying to tell you is, 
it’s not unfair. You haven’t 
been badly treated, any of 
you. Only so many convicts 
can be sent to planets like 
Aperdui. You wouldn’t want 
to live in a sparsely-populated 
world with murderers and 
thieves all around you, would 
you? So nine million peoole 
have to be found. Maybe 

j. t. McIntosh 




you'd rather it was settled by 
a lottery. The governments of 
the world decided it would be 
fairer this way, that’s all.” 

H E looked at Tom. “You 
needn’t have been sent 
here. You knew that you were 
in sole charge of a complicat- 
ed and vital process. The in- 
stant you found the phone 
call was only from — ” 

“I know,” sighed Tom. “I’ve 
had all that already.” 
Rawlings’s gaze passed to 
Joan. “You’ve been told you 
musn’t phone the laboratories. 
You chose to ignore that. You, 
Horne, disregarded clear la- 
bor regulations. You two took 
up more than your fair share 
of Earth’s supplies. And you, 
Miss Kay, knew perfectly 
well you were making an ob- 
scene film.” 

“I didn’t think it was ob- 
scene.” 

“But you knew the censors 
would, didn’t you?” 

Rawlings sighed, knowing 
they were unsympathetic, and 
made one final try. “Twenty- 
five years ago I was in exactly 
the same position as all of 
you. I’d falsified a report in 
an attempt to get a flat, after 
waiting three years. When I 
was brought before the Trans- 
portation Board, I felt as you 
feel now. And I’ll be honest 
with you, Verdan seemed to 
me, when I got there, even 
worse than I expected. But 
now. twenty-five years later 
I—” 



“We all know,” said Tom. 
“You envy us. Look, if I spent 
twenty-five years trying to 
give up dope and finally suc- 
ceeded, I’d be glad I’d made it 
in the end. But that doesn’t 
mean I’d enjoy every minute 
of the twenty-five years. Cut 
the cackle — what happens 
now?” 

When they had gone, Raw- 
lings stared gloomily at the 
papers in front of him. For 
sheer frustration, this job 
took some beating. Satisfied 
settlers were always employed 
for these interviews, in the 
hope of sparkling off some en- 
thusiasm in the disgruntled 
emigrants. But Rawlings had- 
n’t seen any enthusiasm in 
this bunch. The sooner his 
contract was up and he could 
get back to good old Verdan 
the better. 

Then Rawlings brightened 
a little. At least there was 
Sylvia Oliver. The kiss she 
had given him to seal the bar- 
gain made his collar feel too 
tight when he thought about 
it. 

And he needn’t feel he was 
selling out the colonies. A girl 
like that would be sure to land 
in trouble again within six 
months The reflection salved 
his conscience. 

His conscience didn’t bother 
him because he was cheating 
the other six, the six who 
were going to Aperdui. It 
bothered him because he was 
cheating Sylvia Oliver by 
keeping her here on Earth. 



THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



15 





mm 



Ill 

T HEY hadn’t much time to 
get used to the idea of 
starting a new life on Aper- 
dui. Since passengers were al- 
ways kept in cocoons, the 
journey from Earth to Aper- 
dui didn’t exist as far as they 
were concerned. 

They were suddenly, very 
suddenly — too suddenly — just 
new settlers dumped in the 
middle of a prairie somewhere 
in Aperdui. 

The tall man in check shirt 
and filthy breeches — he didn’t 
bother to tell them his name — 
pointed at the rough shelter 
and said : “Started your house 
for you. Always do that for 
new settlers. Guess there was 
some mistake about your 
group. Thought there was a 
spare woman. Bill Perkins 
will be mad as hell when he 
shows.’’ 

Johnny found himself the 
spokesman for the group. 
“You’re not going? We know 
nothing about this place.’’ 
Check Shirt didn’t pause on 
the way to his horse. Over his 
shoulder he said: “Bill Per- 
kins will be here in a couple 
hours. No harm you can come 
to till then.” 

They watched him ride off 
slowly in the afternoon heat. 
Then they looked around. 

No Earthman of the eight- 
eenth, nineteenth or early 
twentieth century would have 
been much perturbed by what 
they saw. The country was 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



flat, consisting of grassland, 
bracken, black rock and occa- 
sional small clumps of trees. 
The scene wasn’t unlike early 
American prairie. 

But there hadn’t been any 
American prairie left for a 
couple of centuries or so, and 
the three men and three wom- 
en from Earth saw Aperdui 
as naked, terrifying wilder- 
ness. To them, ground was 
concrete, horizons were sky- 
lines, and the only open spaces 
were seas (now rapidly being 
covered with huge floating 
cities) . 

By elimination, the crude 
shelter fifty yards from them 
must be the “house” Check 
Shirt had said had been start- 
ed for them. It consisted of 
four thick poles supporting a 
plaited-grass roof. A foot off 
the ground a rough wooden 
floor had been constructed. 
That was all. 

There was no road. A truck 
had borne them across the 
prairie, jolting so much that 
they’d hardly been able to see 
the country. 

It was hot, but not too hot. 
And no more than a hundred 
yards beyond the shelter was 
a broad, clear stream — the 
reason, no doubt, for the 
choice of site. 

“Anyway, we can have a 
swim,” Sandra said, stripping 
off her clothes. 

“There may be fish — crabs 
— water insects,” Tom warn- 

“Well, we’ll soon find out.” 



17 




N AKED, Sandra dived into 
the stream. One by one, 
as nothing disastrous hap- 
pened to her, the others peeled 
and followed her. 

Johnny swam upstream af- 
ter Sandra. He caught her in 
a clear pool and kissed her. 
She laughed, threw her hair 
■out of her eyes and swam still 
further upstream at a rate he 
couldn’t match. 

Sandra was still a realist. 
Although the matter hadn’t 
been discussed among them, 
they all knew that in condi- 
tions like those of Aperdui 
there would be no bachelors 
and spinsters except women 
who couldn’t get a man and 
men who couldn’t get a wom- 
an. Sandra had to take John- 
ny or somebody else, and 
pretty damn quick. She didn’t 
have to marry him — nobody 
would worry much about mar- 
riage during the next twenty 
years or so. Whether a man 
and woman living together 
were married or not didn’t 
matter until there were neigh- 
bors. And it would be a long 
time before there were any 
neighbors. 

Johnny finally caught San- 
dra far upstream and pulled 
her to the bank. She let him 
kiss her but she didn’t let him 
do anything else, not yet. A 
girl had her pride. One mani- 
festation of this was how long 
she kept him waiting. It 
might not be years, months, 
weeks. It might not even he 
days. But it had to be at least 

18 



a few hours no matter what. 

When Bill Perkins arrived 
they were sitting or lying in 
the sun beside the stream. All 
of them had put something on, 
just to prove they were still 
civilized, even in such a world. 

Bill Perkins didn’t look civi- 
lized at all, though he wore a 
check shirt and fairly clean 
shorts. He was tall and lean, 
thirty or so, heavily tanned, 
slow-speaking and quick-mov- 
ing. Johnny, at least, liked 
him on sight, 

Perkins was philosophical 
about the absence of a spare 
woman. “Guess I’d better stick 
around till you’ve got the 
hang of things,” he said. 
“Have to move on then, 
though. Gather round, folks, 
and I’ll try to explain the set- 
up.” 

“Do you have to talk like a 
cowboy?” asked Joan, irri- 
tated. 

H E looked her over for a 
few seconds before reply- 
ing. “No,” he said mildly. “I 
could talk like an advertising 
copywriter, which is what I 
used to be. With an effort, I 
could talk like a college pro- 
fessor, considering I once 
went to college. But somehow 
there doesn’t seem to be much 
use for ten-dollar words out 
here. It’s surprising how 
many words I know and don’t 
have to use.” 

“How’s the food situation?” 
asked Tubby eagerly. 

Perkins looked him over too. 



j. t. McIntosh 




Tubby had lost thirty pounds 
on the trip, but he still looked 
like a balloon man, especially 
with his naked belly hanging 
over the towel which covered 
his loins. 

When Perkins spoke, he 
didn’t answer Tubby’s ques- 
tion directly. “First, we get 
some ground cleared,” he said. 
“Guess we can borrow a horse 
and plough from the Rosen- 
heims, ten miles thataway. 
We get the seed for free. And 
meantime we draw supplies in 
relation to the acreage we got 
planted, or intend to plant. 
The first load arrives by truck 
at sunset.” 

“You don’t use cash yet?” 
Johnny inquired. 

“Well, we do, but for new 
settlers it’s an abstraction. 
We’ll have to live on credit 
for a couple of years anyway, 
and nobody counts the pen- 
nies too accurately, any more 
than you will when another 
new group is set down ten 
miles to the east. That won’t 
happen for about five years, 
anyway. Won’t happen at all 
if you can show you can use 
more than ten miles of land. 
There’s plenty of land, if you 
can show it isn’t going to be 
wasted.” 

“Sheep?” asked Johnny. 
“Can we stock with sheep?” 

Perkins favored him with 
the same searching scrutiny. 
This time he seemed to like 
what he saw. “You could,” he 
said. “But a lot of other guys 
had heard of Australia before 



they got here. And, though 
you probably think you’re pi- 
oneers, you’re too late to make 
a fortune with sheep. Best bet 
would be wheat, I’d say. Soil’s 
right for it too.” 

“Sometimes you say ‘we’ 
and sometimes ‘you,’ ” Johnny 
said. “How long are you stay- 
ing, Bill?” 

“Well, I thought there was 
an extra woman in this party. 
Might find one and bring her. 
If I don’t, guess I won’t wait 
any longer than I have to. 
Maybe a couple of months, to 
get you started. Any of you 
know anything about farm- 
ing? Somebody must, or you 
wouldn’t have been left to- 
gether like this.” 

“I do,” said Tom. “Via hy- 
droponics.” 

Perkins gave him the usual 
slow examination. A good sec- 
ond-in-command, he thought. 
A man with brains but no 
drive. Johnny Horne would be 
the leader. 

A T last Perkins turned back 
to Tubby, whose question 
had never been answered. 
“We get the first load of sup- 
plies bv truck at sunset,” he 
repeated. “There’ll be enough 
to keep us alive and healthy, 
sure. But by the look of you, 
mister, you’re going to be 
hungry for about thirty years. 
It’ll be that time before any- 
body around here will be able 
to eat until he busts.” 

A groan escaped Tubby. At 
the same time Sandra jumped 



THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



19 




and slapped her knee. “Some- 
thing bit me !” she said. 

Perkins scrutinized her, too. 
In white satin shorts and a 
green ribbon of a brassiere, 
she looked like a film star, 
which perhaps was hardly 
surprising. Above his reach, 
Bill decided without regret. 
Besides, Johnny seemed to 
have claims. 

“Mosquito,” he said. “It 
stings some, that’s all.” 

“Didn’t mosquitoes used to 
carry disease?” Joan asked 
sharply. “Malaria, or some- 
thing?” 

Bill Perkins shrugged. 
“Never knew of anybody get- 
ting sick after mosquito bites 
here.” 

“Insects, not only mosqui- 
toes, used to be carriers,” Tom 
said. “Unless there’s some- 
thing to carry, they’re pretty 
harmless. Malaria died out on 
Earth before the carriers did. 
The last mosquitoes were 
clean.” 

“I thought there were no 
vehicles on Aperdui except 
carts,” Johnny said. “But a 
truck brought us here.” 

“There’s about ten trucks 
on this world, all assembled 
from parts brought from 
Earth. There’s even a couple 
of helicopters. But they’re for 
real emergencies. Aren’t even 
brought out for straightfor- 
ward things like maternity 
cases.” 

All the women had been 
thinking about this already. 
On Earth it was possible to 

20 



have babies between televi- 
sion shows. They had already 
guessed that here things might 
be slightly different. 

They talked about the ar- 
rangements for expectant 
mothers for a while, and then 
Kate suddenly said : “Where’s 
Tubby? I haven’t seem him 
since — ” 

The stream was in a slight 
hollow. When they climbed out 
of it and looked at the shelter, 
they saw Tubby right away, 
hanging from the rafters. 

Apart from a few gasps 
from the women, there was 
silence. Nobody rushed to cut 
him down. He was too still for 
it to be worth while. 

Besides, most of them felt 
that if that was what Tubby 
wanted, nobody ought to. try 
to take it from him. 

Bill looked around and for 
the first time surveyed Kate. 
She was thin and stringy. But 
he liked thin and stringy wo- 
men, being lean himself. 

“Guess maybe I won’t be 
moving on after all,” he said. 

T HE first time the supply 
truck called it merely 
dumped supplies and left. The 
second time, however, it 
brought a supply officer, 
Harry Rinker. 

Rinker listened as Johnny 
outlined their plans. Bill Per- 
kins stayed around, silent. 
Some things the new settlers 
had to find out for themselves. 
When Johnny was through, 
Rinker made quick mental 

j. t. McIntosh 




estimates and told them what 
he could supply on the basis 
of the plans presented to him. 

It wasn’t quite enough to 
keep the six of them alive. 

From there Johnny went to 
the other extreme. He had 
presented his minimum aims 
first. Now he tried his maxi- 
mum on Rinker. 

The supply officer shook his 
head. The six of them just 
couldn’t do that much, he said. 
A reasonable compromise was 
reached. 

When Rinker had gone, 
Johnny turned to Bill, frown- 
ing. “I thought it was possible 
to build up from nothing here? 
On that basis, we’ll be in debt 
all our lives.” 

“Well, you need to work 
pretty hard,” said Bill judici- 
ally. 

“I was transported from 
Earth for working too hard.” 

“Were you, now? That’s in- 
teresting. You'll never be 
transported from Aperdui for 
anything like that. Well, look, 
Johnny, most people are too 
optimistic about what they 
can do. That’s why Rinker 
has to be cautious. You can 
succeed here, like anywhere 
else, if you have the basic 
qualities.” 

“And what are the basic 
qualities? What’s the basic 
quality?” 

Bill thought for a moment. 
Then he said slowly : “I guess 
it would be knowing when to 
keep going and when to dig 
in. The cautious guys, the 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



guys who aren’t prepared to 
risk anything, don’t do much 
better here than anywhere 
else. And the stop-at-nothing 
guys, the guys who won’t give 
an inch no matter how badly 
the breaks run against them, 
they don’t become Rockefel- 
lers either. It’s the guys who 
run the tide when things are 
going good, taking on twice, 
five times as much as they 
planned, and dig in the mo- 
ment the tide starts turning — 
those guys are the guys who 
come out on top in a place 
like this.” 

Johnny nodded thought- 
fully. “Another thing. Why 
are new groups left to fend 
for themselves like this, with 
only one fellow who knows 
the ropes to help them? Why 
aren’t we mixed in with ex- 
perienced farmers, who know 
the conditions and the climate 
and the planet itself?” 

“Well, now, Johnny, new 
settlements have to be lands 
of promise. There’s got to be 
something to work for, to 
live for. Suppose the six of 
us here did well the first year 
and better the next and even 
better the year after. Suppose 
we had the best goddam farm 
in the whole of Aperdui, and 
the best workers. How would 
we like it if sombody came 
along and split us all up, send- 
ing us in twos to work with 
new groups just out from 
Earth?” 

“I get it. - It’s a chance of 
complete failure, but a chance 



21 




of making a big success too." 
"Sure.” 

Johnny took a deep breath. 
"Well, it’s not going to be 
failure," he said definitely. 

W EEKS passed. Months 
passed. All the women 
were with child, but by sheer 
accident it was going to work 
out that they’d all be able to 
help each other when the time 
came. 

Nobody was exactly happy, 
but then, nobody had any time 
to be miserable. 

Aperdui had had a tiny 
ecology before the Earthmen 
arrived. There were a few in- 
sects, a few birds, a few small 
animals, chiefly marsupials. 
There were remains of many 
more species. No one quite 
knew yet why or how they 
had died out. It certainly 
didn’t seem to be because con- 
ditions had been too tough for 
them. 

One theory was that one 
species had killed off most of 
the others, upsetting the bal- 
ance so that its own food be- 
came extinct too. Even here, 
Tom realized, the Balance 
Must Be Preserved. 

Certainly this left Aperdui 
a pretty friendly world for 
Earthmen, if there were 
enough of them. 

That was the snag. 

It wasn’t that things could- 
n’t be made on Aperdui. Of 
course thev could, if enough 
people could and would buy 
them. But it was no use man- 



ufacturing a car and selling it, 
if a couple of years were 
going to pass before anybody 
else wanted a car and had the 
money to pay for it. And cars 
weren’t much good without 
roads. And there were no 
roads. And nobody wanted to 
go anywhere, anyway. 

Tractors, now, everybody 
wanted tractors. It was still 
cheaper, however, to get them 
from Verdan, the nearest 
manufacturing world, than to 
make them on Aperdui. And 
tractors from Verdan cost too 
much. 

On Aperdui, people like 
Johnny Horne learned the 
economic facts of life the hard 
way. A tractor from Verdan 
cost $65,000. With a tractor 
they could multiply their pro- 
duction several times, but the 
tractor would not have paid 
for itself by the time it had 
to be scrapped. Nevertheless, 
the work it had done before it 
died of old age would even- 
tually pay for it. 

Sandra had a son and Kate 
had a daughter. Joan lost her 
baby and went on doing the 
same thing with distressing 
regularity. 

A PART from this and a 
minor flood there were no 
snags during the first year. 
The next year the floods were 
worse. The vear after that, 
worse still. The people of Kay- 
horn had learned their lesson 
the first time, however, and 
while other farms were badly 



22 



J. T. MclNTOSH 




damaged, Kayhorn lost little 
or nothing. 

The^e were three houses 
and a barn now, primitive but 
solid. In the fourth year they 
even had running water and 
water closets — also primitive, 
but working most of the time. 

The five people who had 
come from Earth looked very 
different now. Johnny and 
Sandra were lean and bronzed, 
twice as tough as they had 
been when they landed. Kate, 
surprisingly, had begun to 
run to fat after her first preg- 
nancy. Joan was pale and 
moody. She was the one who 
took least to Aperdui (apart 
from Tubby), and frequently 
regretted that she hadn’t 
taken Rawlings up on his 
offer. If any of her babies 
had lived things might have 
been different. Tom was quiet 
and thoughtful these days. He 
was the one who did all the 
figuring. 

Tom had always imagined, 
and so had Johnny for that 
matter, that in a closed group 
the natural, inevitable leader 
would be the most intelligent 
of them, the one who did the 
thinking and figuring. It didn’t 
work out that way. Both he 
and Johnny, not to mention 
the other four, acknowldeged 
it. 

From the beginning Johnny 
had taken the decisions. The 
farm had been called Kayhorn 
half jokingly at first, but it 
was soon accepted that John- 
ny was the boss. Bill Perkins 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



had the experience; Tom 
Camm had the brains; and 
Johnny was the boss. 

It wasn’t until the fifth an- 
niversary of their arrival at 
Kayhorn — which also, by a 
strange coincidence, was the 
fifth anniversary of the three 
unlegalized marriages — that 
Sandra said to Johnny, in a 
tone of surprise: “You know, 
Johnny — we’re happy here.” 
He grinned. “You and I — 
and Junior and Mary and Kit 
and Frances. We’re happy.” 
“And the others too, sure- 
ly?” 

“The kids, yes. Bill, yes. 
And one of these days Kate 
will admit that she’s getting 
used to the place. But Tom 
and Joan . .” 

“Sure, they keep saying this 
is a hell of a place and they’d 
give anything to get back to 
Earth. But people don’t al- 
ways mean what they say.” 
Johnny didn’t argue. He 
rarely did. and never with 
Sandra. That didn’t mean, 
however, that he agreed about 
Tom and Joan. 

IV 

T HE sixth year was the 
Year of the Tractors. At 
last the equation balanced. It 
became worth while making 
tractors on Aperdui. 

Johnny managed not only 
to buy a tractor but also to 
put some money into the trac- 
tor business. 

It was strange, yet typical, 

23 




that Tom had to explain to 
him how and why the busi- 
ness was a good investment, 
how the profits would be so 
small at first that Johnny 
could get a bigger and bigger 
hold on the tractor business — 
and yet Johnny invested in it 
and Tom didn’t. 

As happiness had crept up 
on them, so wealth crept up 
on them. Johnny was not yet 
thirty.; Sandra was twenty- 
seven. They worked as hard 
as ever. Yet one day Tom told 
Johnny that the total value 
of their joint undertakings, 
excluding Johnny’s tractor 
stock, was close on a hundred 
thousand dollars. 

Considering that three trac- 
tors cost that much, it didn’t 
seem riches beyond the dreams 
of avarice. That meant that 
each of the adults, not count- 
ing the seven children, was 
worth about half a tractor. 
The achievement had to be in- 
terpreted: from debt to sol- 
vency to money-in-the-bank. 

Seven years after farming 
at Kayhorn began, a road was 
built through it. And the road 
actually led to a town. At the 
moment the town consisted of 
two farms, a store, a black- 
smith’s shop and a hall, and 
it was called, with the usual 
originality of settlers, New 
Chicago. 

The next year Tom and 
Joan left Kayhorn. They had 
the chance of a nearby farm 
which had failed through mis- 
management, and they took it. 

24 



The parting was not acrimo- 
nious; Johnny lent Tom the 
money he needed. Both farms, 
Kayhorn and “the Camm 
place,” took on hired men. 
There were immigrants from 
Earth these days who prefer- 
red working for a wage to 
starting a farm of their own. 
And there were people who 
could afford to employ them. 

T AXES started in Kay- 
horn’s tenth year. Nobody 
paid them with any great en- 
thusiasm, but it was obvious 
that what had been a frontier 
world only interested in sur- 
vival now needed schools, po- 
lice, hospitals and even a gov- 
ernment building somewhere. 

On Johnny’s thirty-fifth 
birthday he realized he was a 
millionaire. 

Of course, it was all very 
theoretical. If he was sudden- 
ly told he could go back to 
Earth provided he sold out 
within a week, he’d probably 
not be able to realize much 
more than a quarter of a mil- 
lion. But that was theoretical 
too. If he were told that, he 
wouldn’t go. 

It delighted him to be able 
to make things easier for San- 
dra now. At thirty-three, with 
five children, she had lost her 
twenty-two-inch waistline, but 
with her magnificent bust and 
hips a twenty-four-inch waist- 
line was more appropriate, 
anvway. She had worked like 
a slave for nearly ten years, 
and now freely acknowledged 

j. t. McIntosh 




that it hadn’t done her any 
harm. Nevertheless, Johnny’s 
greatest happiness these days 
was that when he came home 
from work, Sandra was wait- 
ing for him. In other words, 
she hadn’t been working at his 
shoulder all day. 

It delighted him to be able 
to add to the amenities of 
their home. There was the 
concrete walk all the way to 
the road, for example. No 
need to bring mud into the 
house any more every time 
you entered. And gradually 
the wood-and-grass house was 
becoming stone and tile. John- 
ny could have built an entirely 
new house, but he didn’t want 
that and knew Sandra didn’t 
want it either. 

There came the day when 
the first radio programs start- 
ed. Johnny and Sandra and 
the children listened with all 
the eagerness of the first crys- 
tal-set pioneers. The children 
couldn’t understand it at all 
and, when told the radio con- 
verted electrical waves back 
into sound, went outside to 
see if they could see the waves 
in the sky. 

Still Bill Perkins and Kate 
were with them. Kate now al- 
most as fat as Tubby used to 
be. Kate and Sandra, who had 
never had anything in com- 
mon in the old days, were com- 
ing closer together now. There 
was beginning: to be a baby- 
sitting problem again, un- 
known for years because no- 
body ever went out for the eve- 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



ning, and Kate and Sandra 
knew each other's family quite 
as well as. they knew their 
own. It couldn’t be said any 
more that they had nothing in 
common. They had their whole 
lives in common. For the early 
years back on Earth now 
seemed as strange and baffling 
as any dream. 

Bill had never changed. He 
had many chances to leave 
Kayhorn and take over a farm 
of his own, as Tom and Joan 
had done. He never even con- 
sidered them. 

Tom and Joan weren’t do- 
ing very well. Kayhorn had 
given them inflated ideas of 
what could be achieved. They 
bit off far more than they 
could chew and, but for con- 
tinued help from Johnny, the 
Camm place would have foun- 
dered. 

O NCE Sandra and Johnny 
nearly quarreled over the 
Camms. Johnny’s affairs were 
not quite in their usual pros- 
perous condition, owing to a 
storm which destroyed nearly 
a whole crop, when Tom call- 
ed. Sandra said nothing when 
Tom was there, but when he 
departed with all Johnny’s 
spare cash and a note address- 
ed to the bank in New Chi- 
cago, Sandra found herself 
hotly pointing out that he’d 
said Junior’s new bicycle 
would have to wait meantime, 
and now he’d given Tom 
Camm the price of thirty new 
bicycles — given — because 



25 




he’d certainly never see his 
money again. 

“I know, Sandra,” said 
Johnny. “Better not tell Jun- 
ior. He might not under- 
stand.” 

“Well, I don’t understand 
either. That storm cost you 
thousands, but you can stand 
it because you’re prepared for 
such things. Tom can’t stand 
it because he isn’t. You know 
he’ll never pay you back. How 
much more are you going to 
give him?” 

“As much as he needs,” said 
Johnny quietly. 

And as Sandra drew a deep 
breath to tell him what she 
thought of such unrealistic 
altruism — for Sandra was 
still a realist — he added 
quietly: “It’s not just friend- 
ship, honey. There’s such a 
thing as gratitude.” 

“Gratitude?” said Sandra 
blankly. 

“Kayhom owes a lot to Tom 
Caram. More than you’ll ever 
believe. Sure, I made the de- 
cisions, and they were right 
decisions, most of them. Sure, 
without Bill we’d have been 
nowhere. But it was Tom who 
saw the way every time, who 
knew what was going to hap- 
pen if we did this, and what 
would probably happen if we 
did that.” 

“Then why can’t he make 
anything of his own farm?” 

Johnny shrugged. “Tom’s 
the kind of fellow who can’t 
make even the decisions he 
knows must be made. And 

26 



another thing. Joan. When 
Joan griped it didn’t have the 
slightest effect on me. Tom 
could tell me what ought to be 
done, and what Joan thought 
about it didn’t matter a damn 
to me. But it’s got to matter 
to Tom. Think how different 
things were for Tom and me, 
honey. I have you. Tom has 
Joan.” 

There was a long silence. 
Then Sandra said : “Hell, why 
don’t you hit me or something 
instead of making me feel a 
heel? It would be over quick- 
er.” 

He caught her arm and pull- 
ed her down with him, laugh- 
ing. “Honey, after all these 
years do I still have to keep 
telling you? I love you.” 

“Yes,” she said. “You still 
have to keep telling me.” 

I N Kayhorn’s twenty-first 
year immigration from 
Earth stopped. At least, trans- 
portation did. There were still 
a few volunteer immigrants, 
enough to supplement the 
news of Earth which the sup- 
ply ships brought, not enough 
to affect the general situation 
one way or the other. 

Aperdui still had a smaller 
population than Earth had 
had when the Pilgrim Fathers 
landed at Plymouth Rock. But 
at last Aperdui had enough. 

The last transported colon- 
ists were in their twenties, 
thirties, and forties. The ear- 
liest colonists were in their 
thirties, forties, fifties, and 

J. T. MclNTOSH 




sixties. And the oldest mem- 
bers of the second generation, 
the first natives of Aperdui, 
were as old as the youngest 
immigrants. 

On Johnny and Sandra’s 
silver anniversary, Sandra 
found her first gray hair. 

She frowned at it, twitched 
it out, and in sudden alarm 
slipped straps from her shoul- 
ders and looked at herself in 
the full-length mirror. What 
she saw reassured her. 

Still, with all her children 
married she was hardly a girl 
any more. Married . she 
suddenly realized that al- 
though her children were ac- 
tually married, legally mar- 
ried, she and Johnny had 
never gotten around to it. 
Might be as well, one of these 
days. It might get to be a slur 
in little Johnny’s later life 
that his grandparents had 
never been married. 

Tom and Joan came to the 
party, naturally, but both 
Johnny and Sandra, not to 
mention Bill and Kate, were 
surprised to find them happy 
for the first time in years. 
Johnny was even more sur- 
prised when Tom took him 
aside and paid him back every 
last cent he owed him. 

“I didn’t hear that the bank 
had been robbed,” Johnny 
said. 

Tom grinned. “I won’t tell 
you about it now. You’ll hear 
soon enough.” 

And they did, two days lat- 
er. Tom had been offered an 

THAT'S HOW IT GOES 



important government job and 
had sold the farm on better 
terms than he could have hop- 
ed. Land which had been any- 
body’s for the taking twenty- 
five years ago was beginning 
to be quite valuable. 

Tom and Joan were going 
back to Earth. 

“No wonder Joan was pleas- 
ed,” Sandra said, when they 
heard about this. “I wonder if 
they’ll be happy now?” 
Johnny kissed her on the tip 
of her nose. “I lent Tom a 
lot,” he said, ‘‘but I could nev- 
er lend him happiness.” 
“Johnny,” said Sandra. 
‘‘I’ve been thinking. Will you 
marry me?” 

V 

A FTERWARDS, Tom de- 
livered a little sermon, al- 
ways the same. 

‘‘I know you think you’ve 
had a raw deal,” he said, sur- 
veying the eight young men 
and women in front of him, 
“but you’ve got to realize that 
one way or another Earth has 
to get rid of at least fifteen 
million people every year. 
Would you rather have been 
shot or gassed?” 

Nobody answered. 

“Tfyirty years ago,” Tom 
said, “I was in exactly the 
same position as all of you. 
I’d done exactly the same as 
yon. Jones. But now, thirty 
years later — ” 

“I know,” sneered the chem- 
ist. “You envy us. You wish 

27 




you were in our shoes. So do 
we.” 

“Isn’t there any chance, Mr. 
,Camm,” said the school-teach- 
er, “of getting transferred to 
Aperdui instead of Thorn- 
ton?” 

“I’m afraid not. Aperdui is 
fully self-supporting now. It’s 
off the list of Transportation 
worlds. It isn’t a pioneer 
world any more. Of course, 
there’s still plenty to be done 
there . .” 

He sighed. Joan had been 
desperate to come back. 

But on Earth you lived in 
a tiny room four levels down 
from the sky. If you went for 
a walk in the open air, it was 
on rooftops. The food was 
meager and always the same. 
The air was clean and odor- 
less and antiseptic. Even if 
you had no claustrophobic ten- 
dencies, you were oppressed 
by the knowledge that there 
were people eating, sleeping, 
talking, making love, quarrel- 
ling and dying within ten feet 
of you, north, south, east and 
west, above and below. And 
beyond them, in all six direc- 
tions, more people, and be- 
yond them . 

The tragedy was that the 
eight bitter young people in 
front of him were such slaves 
to the little luxuries of life on 
Earth that they thought they 
were being condemned to a liv- 
ing death instead of being 
granted the boon of freedom, 
of open space, of discovery. 
And the frustration of his own 



position was that he never 
succeeded in communicating 
to them the sincerity of his 
own longing to get out of the 
sardine-can which was Earth. 
Even Joan wanted to get back 
to Aperdui. But he still had 
three years of his contract to 
fulfill. 

“Thornton is a grand world,” 
he began. 

“Look, do we have to hear 
you talk?” the busted cop de- 
manded. “Send us straight to 
the spaceport and get it over.” 

W HEN they had gone, Tom 
stared gloomily at the 
papers in front of him. For 
sheer frustration, this job took 
some beating. God, how he 
wished he was back on Aper- 
dui ! Johnny would help him to 
get started again, he knew. 

He brightened a little. At 
least there was the bubble 
dancer. When she had kissed 
him to seal the bargain he had 
suddenly felt thirty years 
younger, as if he were just 
setting out for Aperdui again. 

And he didn’t have to feel 
he was selling out the colonies 
by holding her back. A girl 
like that would be sure to land 
in trouble again within six 
months. The reflection salved 
his conscience. 

His conscience didn’t bother 
him because he was cheating 
the other eight, the eight who 
were going to Thornton. It 
bothered him because he was 
cheating the girl by keeping 
her here on Earth. end

Nirva was a real bore. 
The food was always great, 
the climate tediously fine, 
the view monotonously lovely, 
the girls relentessly amiable. 

But, oddly, 
everybody went therel 




H\T ACATION trip to Nir- 
* va? !?” snapped Secad 
Screed — Galactic Sector Ad- 
ministrator J. Gomer Screed, 
a serious-minded man who 
rarely lost his temper. That 
was a pity; it was a lousy 
temper. “A mindless excur- 
sion, and completely outside 
my Sector at that! Woman, 
are both you and Garten out 
of your minds? Who do you 
think is going run my ad- 
ministration with both Gar- 
ten and I on a childish vaca- 
tion to this absurd ‘Dream 
Planet’ of yours?” 

“Well — there is Deputy As- 
sistant Prinot and — ” 

“Ha! And then what do 
you suppose would be left of 
my record here and my pros- 
pects of promotion — after De- 
past Prinot and the others put 
in five solid weeks wrecking 
all my work?” 

Secast Garten, short, a lit- 
tle Chubby, the opposite of 
his chief (who looked like a 
deep-thinking, bald stork 
scheduled for delivery of Sia- 



30 






mese quintuplets in a ty- 
phoon,) grinned. He was seat- 
ed out of the direct line of 
verbal fire, on a rock-hard 
hassock at one side of the 
barely furnished Screed 
apartment. He grinned, know- 
ing what-Secad Screed would 
do with a similar opportunity 
at Division Hq. 

“Oh, now, dear,” soothed 
Mrs. Screed, a mousey, chron- 
ically anxious little woman 
with five years experience as 
secretary and ten as wife in 
learning to soothe her hus- 
band. “Prinot is such a nice 
man. Don’t worry so about 
things. Just put them out of 
your mind ; they’ll be all 
right.” 

“What?” Fifteen years ex- 
perience she had soothing 
him, but she never did seem 
to get the knack of it. Or, 
perhaps, it was a matter of 
Screed’s conscientiously re- 
fusing to be soothed, as a 
matter of discipline. A wife 
should know her place. Women 
being what they were, light 
minded, he felt it only fair 
that he should regularly point 
it out to her. He didn’t want 
to spoil her. And he didn’t 
either — unless it was in the 
matter of favoring her with 
his personal attentions week- 
ly, at 11:30 p.m., each Friday. 

This was big of him. She 
was ‘lucky. Secad Screed was 
a big man, Administrative Of- 
ficer in full command of a ma- 
jor sun system at only 56, 
wedded to his work and dedi- 



cated to becoming more and 
more important. Mrs. Screed’s 
position was, in a way, almost 
bigamous. She had a rich, full 
fifteen minutes every Friday, 
and what more could any wo- 
man want of life? 

At the moment, this one 
imagined she wanted to take 
a vacation trip to some non- 
sensical, little known, semi- 
mythical dream planet that 
Garten — the fool! — had been 
telling her about. “Garten — ” 

“You are so right, J.G., so 
right. Give Prinot and those 
boys an inch and they’ll be 
measuring you out for a grave 
with it, while they sharpen 
their knives. Half a chance 
and they’d foul up your whole 
Sector Administration. But — 
you know, sir, after five 
straight years on the job for 
both you and me, a five-week 
vacation is compulsory. We 
do have our orders.” 

“Mf-f-f!” That was true 
and that was the rub. “But 
we don’t have to chase off so 
far we can’t keep an eye on 
things !” 

“Of course, sir. Or — an 
idea you gave me just the 
other day, sir — with the re- 
cent Truad activity over in 
Sector Y, we could put this 
whole system into an emer- 
gency invasion alert drill, sir. 
For the duration — of our va- 
cation. Then every move Pri- 
not makes will have to follow 
the book — or a court-martial 
when we get back. With you 
presiding, eh?” 



OUT OF MIND 



31 




S ECAD Screed smiled a 
thin smile. “I thought of 
that, of course, Garten. Cle- 
ver of you to see it. Given 
time, I may be able to make 
a passably capable assistant 
of you after all.” 

Garten was necessarily 
more skilled at soothing 
Screed than was Mrs. S., 
whose somewhat special sta- 
tus brought her very limited 
privileges but considerable 
job security. Garten had hung 
on,, sometimes narrowly, for 
some five years now. 

“Yes sir. I hope so, sir.” 
“But not as long as you 
come up with asinine sugges- 
tions for us to throw away 
valuable time on some scarce- 
ly heard of ‘dream planet.’ 
Even though Centrad does en- 
force these foolish compul- 
sory vacations, there is no 
reason why the time cannot 
be turned to some useful ac- 
count.” 

“But, dear,” murmured Mrs. 
Screed wistfully. 

“No! Viola, you seem to 
have lost whatever few wits 
you once possessed. Why in 
the Galactic Universe would 
I go to some tiny, sink-hole, 
single planet system not even 
important enough to have a 
Service Administration? Even 
I have scarcely heard of the 
place. Garten, what ever got 
into you?” 

“Uh — ah, well, sir. You see 
I — uh — have always admired 
so your report on waste and 
extravagance on Primus that 

32 



you made following your last 
vacation five years ago just 
before coming here. The way 
you toppled the entire Sector 
Administration, forced a doz- 
en or more early retirements 
and — ” 

“And got me my promotion 
to Secad.” 

“Yes, sir. A sensational job, 
and much talked of at Cen- 
trad, I know. Well sir, I just 
thought that, since this Nir- 
va is so little known, some- 
thing of a mystery you know, 
and something of a sore point 
with Centrad too, perhaps it 
might be ripe for an expose.” 

“Mph. Nonsense, Garten. 
Not important e n o u g h — 
though, come to consider, it 
is odd how little public infor- 
mation there is about the 
place. Centrad is covering 
something . Hm-m. Never 
bothered to" check the secret 
files on it myself. Just for 
curiosity, Garten, what is the 
detail on the thing?” 

Mrs. Screed leaned back in 
her chair; glanced blankly 
about the bare apartment; 
picked idly at a cuticle; tried, 
with apprehensively expres- 
sive features, to register total 
disinterest. Once, before dis- 
couragement set in, she had 
been a modestly pretty young 
woman. Now she was merely 
modest. 

“Viola,” snapped Screed, 
“go fix some refreshment. Ice 
water, crackers, something. 
Can't have you sitting there 
mooning over this Nirva non- 

WILLIAM W. STUART 




sense of Garten’s. Your mind 
has too great an affinity for 
nonsense.” 

“Yes, sir. Well, sir — ” 

M RS. Screed threw him a 
fleeting, timid smile over 
her shoulder as she left the 
room through the kitchen 
door, back of Screed’s arm 
chair. Inside of two minutes 
she was back, standing very 
quietly in the doorway with 
a pitcher of water and a dish 
of plain, protein crackers on 
a tray. Garten talked on. 

“Nirva, as you know, is the 
single planet of a small sun 
off on the fringes of this re- 
gion of the Galaxy. It seem- 
ed so insignificant it was nev- 
er even visited until some- 
thing like fifty years ago. 
Then a questionable prospec- 
tor ship had a minor break- 
down and was forced to come 
out of an inter-space jump 
near the Nirva system. The 
prospectors had been ten 
years out. They were coming 
back empty-handed, nothing 
to show, not one valuable 
planet found. There they 
were. Spectroanalysis of Nirva 
didn’t show much, but they 
decided to check anyway. They 
were desperate, dreaming out 
of all reason of a last-ditch 
success — dreaming of a civ- 
ilized, friendly planet, hospit- 
able natives, rich beyond be- 
lief, foolishly ready for exploi- 
tation, eager to load them up 
with fissionable minerals and 
saon. You know how those old 

OUT OF MIND 



space tramp adventurers used 
to be, sir.” 

“Hmph. Tramps, yes. So?” 
“So they landed and discov- 
ered Nirva, the Dream Planet. 
Of course they didn’t find 
that out at the time.” 

“What did they find?” 
“They found a civilized, 
friendly planet, hospitable na- 
tives, rich beyond belief, fool- 
ishly ready for exploitation, 
eager to load them up with 
fissionable minerals and so 
on. There wasn’t even a com- 
munication problem. The peo- 
ple, handsome, human type, 
were telepathic. Well. Their 
visit, although no two of the 
eleven men on the ship could 
agree on the details, was one 
glorious celebration. Liquor 
and no hangovers. Women, 
the most beautiful in the uni- 
verse, competing with each 
other to do everything — I 
mean everything — for the 
pleasure of the space heroes. 
In fact, it seemed a space 
tramp’s dream of heaven. 
They hated to leave.” 

“If the place was such a de- 
generate’s delight, why did 
they leave?” 

“Just simple greed, appar- 
ently. Their ship was loaded 
with the most valuable cargo 
in history. They couldn’t re- 
sist the urge to take it back 
and cash in; to strut around 
and be big heroes, men of 
wealth and power back home. 
Finally, and with plenty of 
regrets, they blasted off. A 
couple of jumps, six months — 

33 




travel was slow then, of 
course — and they landed at 
the regional capital. They re- 
ported their discovery and 
claims, turned in the cargo 
for analysis and sale — and, 
listening for the cheers, sat 
back to collect their fortunes. 
Instead of cheers, they got 
the universal horse laugh.” 
“A laugh? At a fortune? 
Why — oh, yes. Of course ; 
turned out they made a pretty 
stupid mistake about that 
cargo, eh ?” 

66TJTELL, it seemed a fun- 
W ny mistake. Their 
whole cargo of rare, fission- 
able elements was nothing but 
perfectly ordinary sand and 
rock. Now, this crew was 
rough, but prospecting was 
their business. They knew 
their business. It just wasn’t 
possible that they could have 
made such a mistake. At first 
the officials were inclined to 
drop the whole thing as a 
pointless hoax. But it was so 
pointless. Somebody was 
sharp enough to push for an 
investigation on that account. 
They rounded tip the prospec- 
tors, who were all hustling 
around trying to promote sup- 
plies to get them back to Nir- 
va. They got a psychiatric 
team to run them all through 
a complete check. The clues to 
the truth of the matter turn- 
ed up then; but they were 
not, at least not generally un- 
derstood.” 



“What—?” 

“The psychiatric team 
found that each of the eleven 
told a similar story, and ac- 
tually had a similar mental 
picture of Nirva. But, exam- 
ined closely, the detail, the ar- 
tifacts, the — uh — types and — 
ah — um — habits of the wo- 
men were startlingly, if not 
sensationally, different. So 
different that, in fact, the 
planet seemed to be perfect. 
Perfect according to each 
crewman’s idea of the perfect 
planet. Some of them had 
pretty crude ideals of perfec- 
tion, of course. The psychia- 
tric team pushed through an 
order grounding all members 
of the crew. All of them end- 
ed badly, by the way — seven 
suicides, two murders, two 
violent mental cases. The 
team submitted a completely 
inconclusive report. Then 
they proposed that they all 
be sent to examine Nirva.” 

“Well? Get to the point, 
Garten !” 

“The expedition went out. 
It never came back. No word 
ever came back. The admin- 
istration jumped to a conclu- 
sion that the planet, Nirva, 
had become hostile and the 
expeditionary force captured. 
A battle cruiser, advised to 
expect resistance and with 
orders to use all force neces- 
sary to pacify the planet and 
rescue prisoners, was sent 
out. The cruiser went. It met 
resistance near Nirva and 
won a brilliant victory. The 



34 



WILLIAM W. STUART 




Nirva forces surrendered. The 
ship landed and officers and 
crew were feted by the de- 
feated population. Prisoners 
were rescued. Finally, and 
with some little reluctance 
the captain, a devoted family 
man, gave orders and the crui- 
ser headed back. But — at the 
first jump away, the prisoners 
and something like two-thirds 
of the cruiser’s crew vanish- 
ed. Naturally there was a 
good deal of excitement. 
“Arrant nonsense.” 

“Yes, sir. Of course. But — 
two further rescue expedi- 
tions ran into much the same 
thing. It seemed that only 
individuals with the most vi- 
tal and binding ties or absorb- 
ing interests back home ever 
came back from Nirva. 
Others, especially anyone with 
the least trace of instability, 
stayed there.” 

“A lunatic planet for the 
feeble-minded !” 

66TTH — yes, sir. In a man- 
U ner of speaking. At 
least the officially approved 
conclusion regarding Nirva is 
this. No way to be certain 
but, presumably, from sam- 
ple materials and distance ob- 
servation, it appears a rather 
ordinary, Earth-type planet 
physically. It is inhabited by 
a race, physical characteris- 
tics doubtful, probably hu- 
manoid, having, unique men- 
tal properties. Imaginative, 
very powerful, hypnotic. And, 
the theory goes, these people 

OUT OF MIND 



exercise a sort of group mind 
power with individualistic 
overtones. To all intents and 
purposes, they modify their 
physical — and social — s u r - 
roundings to suit themselves. 
Each then lives quite literally 
in a world of his own. The 
world of his dreams. For visi- 
tors from outside, same thing. 
Each person who lands on 
Nirva, or even approaches it 
without a powerful force 
shield, sees what he imagines 
he should see. He finds what- 
ever he may be looking for. 
A man who has mental air 
castles, you might say, can go 
to Nirva and move right into 
them. As they say, sir, the 
planet of dreams.” 

“Hallucinations !” 

“Yes, sir. But controlled, 
pleasant — and having all the 
force, feel and effect of reali- 
ty. So the theory has it, that 
is. Of course, travel to Nirva 
is so restricted as to be al- 
most completely prohibited 
now and the information wip- 
ed from public records. The 
administration could see that 
it might become disastrously 
over popular.” 

“Why not wipe out the 
whole lunatic asylum of a 
system ?” 

“Ah — yes. Well — uh — per- 
haps some of the men at the 
top thought perhaps it might 
turn out to be useful in — uh — 
some way.” 

“There have been rumors 
of mysterious disappearances 
of officials. Weakness.” 



35 




“Yes sir. Exactly.” 

“A haven for weak-minded 
idiots to be taken in by stupid, 

f arlor hypnotics. Why should 
waste my time and talent 
exposing something so totally 
and transparently stupid?” 
“Of course, sir. It would be 
a difficult thing to try to 
manage. I’m sure — in spite of 
the enormous publicity and 
promotional possibilities in 
clearing up the mystery — that 
it’s not the sort of thing a 
solid administrator would care 
to get mixed up in.” 

The Secad looked inter- 
ested. 

“A perfectly horrible sound- 
ing place,” interrupted Viola 
from her doorway, “I had no 
idea it would be anything like 
that. It sounds immoral, ac- 
tually. I wouldn’t go.” 

The Secad looked thought- 
ful. 

“Besides,” added Garten, 
“I’m certain, now I consider 
it, we couldn’t possibly man- 
age to get a clearance to visit 
Nirva anyway.” 

“Well, then,” said Viola 
firmly. “You know how the 
Secad needs a rest. I do hope 
you can find something more 
suitable for our vacation than 
that. Some place that’s quiet 
and respectable and — ” 

The Secad looked convinced. 
“Oh, shut up, Viola. And you 
too, Garten. If we must go 
on a vacation, we must — but I 
shall decide where we will go. 
Is that clear?” 

That was clear. 



N IRVA stuck in the mind 
of Secad Screed. He was, 
certainly, the sanest, sound- 
est, solidest and most sensible 
of men. It was not possible to 
trick him into any hasty, ill- 
considered action. 

Still, it rankled to have 
Garten and, of all people, Vi- 
ola tell him he couldn’t go to 
Nirva — and couldn’t succeed 
in doing anything about it if 
he did. 

Of course, it is true that a 
man can trust no one but him- 
self. It was transparently ob- 
vious that Viola and that pip- 
squeek Garten were trying to 
con him into taking them to 
Nirva. But it was an irrita- 
tion. And maybe the thing 
did, actually, offer the possi- 
bility for something sensa- 
tional in the way of a coup. 

Naturally, Garten and Vi- 
ola were interested only in the 
supposed cheap thrills of the 
dream planet, the chance to 
escape from practical, busi- 
ness-like reality into some de- 
generate make-believe. They 
both needed a lesson. They 
should be shown how poor and 
weak a thing a romantic 
dream is, when brought up 
short by the trained, super- 
ior, analytical administrative 
mind. 

The next day at work he 
set Garten to work drafting 
up orders for an emergency 
invasion alert drill “just in 
case.” He then consulted with 
his Neuro-Surgeon General. 
“Naturally, Dr. Treadmel,

I would never dream of direc- 
ting any illegal actions with- 
in my own jurisdiction — 
where, of course, I am Secad 
and therefore the judge of all 
questions of legality. And of 
your Department too, Doctor, 
you may take note. However, 
the information I am endeav- 
oring to extract from you I 
shall apply, if at all, solely to 
the planet Nirva. Not to any 
of ours.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Very well, Doctor. Now. 
You are familiar with hyp- 
notics, are you not?” 

“Sir!” The Doctor was 
hurt. “One of the primary du- 
ties — ” 

“All right. You are famil- 
iar with hypnotics. You use 
them all the time in legal 
questions, crime, employment 
interviewing in depth and so 
on. Naturally. And you are 
also aware of various meas- 
ures — yes, yes, I know they 
are specifically barred by the 
Public Safety Amendment — 
some mechanical and some 
narcotic, that may be taken 
to counteract or prevent hyp- 
nosis. So. My question is this. 
Would such measures as your 
low power, hyper-electronic 
broadcast and your anti-hyp- 
notic drugs be effective 
against the spell or illusion 
the inhabitants of Nirva use 
on visitors and, perhaps, 
themselves?” 

“Well, now, Secad Screed, 
that is an extremely interes- 
ting question.” 

OUT OF MIND 



“I am interested only in the 
answer, Doctor.” 

“Uf. Yes, sir. Well, I can 
see no reason why they 
wouldn’t be effective — always 
supposing the subjective hyp- 
notic theory of the place is 
correct. That is — in theory — 
this group mind, which is sup- 
posed to provide the basis, 
should be totally disrupted by 
the random or scrambling ef- 
fect of the electronic broad- 
cast. The drugs, on the other 
hand, would render the indi- 
vidual who took the drug, 
during the period of its effec- 
tiveness, totally un- or non- 
receptive to the impulse, 
whereas — ” 

“All right, Doctor. You are 
trying to say, in your obfus- 
cating manner, that the meas- 
ures would be effective. 
Right?” 

“Subjectively, not taking 
into account the hypothetical 
possibility of random foci — 
and, of course, barring cir- 
cumstances outside the range 
of—” 

“Doctor! Yes? Or no?” 
“Well— uh— yes.” 

“Doctor, when you have 
quite finished the duties I am 
about to assign you, I suggest 
you visit my legal staff for a 
game of circumlocution. In 
the meantime — get me that 
drug.” 

“Yes, sir. You understand 
the limitations — ” 

“And give Chief Engineer 
Barstow the specifics for an 
anti-hypnotic electronic ampli- 



37 




fier, suitable for placing in 
satellite orbit.” 

“But—” 

“Around Nirva. Good-by, 
Doctor!” 

And tliat would take care 
of that. 

O F course Nirva, the 
Dream Planet, was a 
fake. It was a fairy story for 
childish minds, not capable 
of affecting the mature intel- 
lect. But there was nothing 
like being doubly sure.' Secad 
Screed was always sure. 

The only thing that upset 
him more than being not quite 
sure was the idea of some- 
thing being wrong. But of 
course this never happened. 

“All right, Viola,” he said 
that night, after letting her 
sit, fidgety, looking the ques- 
tion she didn’t quite dare to 
ask all evening long. “So you 
want to go to this ridiculous 
planet, Nirva. Don’t you?” 
“Dear, of course not! Not 
if you don’t think — that is, 
you said it was stupid. So of 
course we wouldn’t — ” 

“Please, Viola. You should 
know better than to try to 
deceive me. And so should 
Garten. It is completely and 
transparently clear to me that 
both of you are trying to get 
me to take you to this so-call- 
ed dream world. Childish es- 
capism. You know that?” 
“Yes, of course, dear.” 
“Very well. We are going.” 
“Oh ! How wonderful. Thank 
you !” 

“Don’t thank me now. La- 



ter, afterward, you can thank 
me. When I have done you 
and Garten the service of 
showing you the infantile im- 
maturity of your own minds. 
I am, Viola my dear, going 
to expose to the Galaxy this 
tawdry charlatanism for the 
little carnival illusion that it 
is. I shall show you the su- 
perior mental power of a 
mind — mine— ^that can face 
reality. You, and possibly 
even Garten, like drug addicts 
think you can escape from 
fact into a dream world.” 
“Oh, no.” 

“You will learn that there 
is no escape. I shall show you 
to yourselves. And you will 
see that run-down, sink-hole 
planet of lotus eaters for the 
degenerate mental slum it 
truly must be and is.” 

“Oh ? Well, it is good of you 
to go to so much trouble.” 
Smugly, “The expose may 
prove of some advantage in 
my Service career.” 

“Of course, dear.” 

Of course. Of course, there 
was a period of frantic, forc- 
ed-draft preparation by cer- 
tain of the Administration 
Departments. Garten was vol- 
uble in his admiration of the 
plan for the electronic broad- 
cast, anti-hypnotic satellite 
for Nirva. On the drugs, he 
had no comment. He was not, 
in fact, informed of this part 
of the plan. Clearance for 
Secad Screed and party to 
visit the “Limited Access” 
Planet, Nirva, was obtained

from Inter-Regional Head- 
quarters with surprisingly, if 
not suspiciously, little difficul- 
ty. Screed smiled a sour little 
smile. Jealousy, perhaps. He 
would show them, too. 

I N two weeks standard time, 
they — Secad Screed, Mrs. 
Viola Screed and Secast Gar- 
ten — were on the way. It was 
a small ship, with a crew spe- 
cially screened for the stop at 
Nirva, bound for the farther 
reaches of the Galaxy. At the 
end of three inter-space jumps 
it would orbit in to leave them 
on Nirva. Five weeks later, 
on the return trip, it would 
put in again to pick them up. 

At the end of the third 
jump, Secad Screed and party, 
VIP’s certainly, visited the 
ship’s captain in the control 
room. 

“We are coming in to the 
planet now, Captain,” an- 
nounced Screed informatively. 
“I want to be certain that the 
satellite is functioning prop- 
erly and placed in planned or- 
bit, regular, between sixty 
and ninety minutes.” 

“Yes, sir,” sighed the cap- 
tain, a morose-looking man 
with an anachronistic, droop- 
ing moustache, “Believe me, 
Secad Screed, within my de- 
plorably narrow limits I do 
know my business. Your sat- 
ellite is being attended to 
now. We are within the field 
of Nirva. We will make our 
run in, fingers crossed, so you 
may debark.” 

OUT OF MIND 



“Fingers crossed, Captain? 
Hmph ! Well — let’s have a 
look at the thing on the view 
screen.” 

“Sorry — but no, sir. We 
go in on automatic instru- 
ments, with special electric 
power shield up all the way. 
I’ll cut the shield just long 
enough for you to land and 
back up she goes. Likely I'll 
lose a couple of my crew at 
that.” 

“Nonsense! Have you no 
confidence in the satellite?” 

The captain shrugged. “I 
take no chances.” 

This was a line of reason 
Screed could well appreciate 
— in himself. From the cap- 
tain it seemed foolishness. 

“Surely, Captain, if you 
were to lose crewmen you 
could and would insist upon 
their immediate return?” 

“Insist, Secad Screed ? 
How? You do not, I think, 
have quite the full picture of 
this thing. Its appeal, the pull 
of your own personal perfect 
dream world, is very strong. 
If I didn’t have a wife and six 
sweet kids back home that I 
only see a month or two out 
of the year — well. This Nir- 
va problem is like this. We go 
in. Down screen. Off you and 
your party go. My crew? All 
present. OK, back up with 
the screen — and then we find 
out who is actually on the 
ship.” 

“But if they were all pres- 
ent — ?” 

“Maybe present; maybe no- 

39 




thing-but projected illusions. 
It is not possible to distin- 
guish. So, say a couple are 
missing when the screen goes 
up. Suppose I down screen 
again. Protest. The natives 
are all apology. The men re- 
turn.” 

“AH right then.” 

“Not exactly. When the 
screen is up again — maybe 
instead of two missing, by 
then I would have four gone. 
The temptation gets too 
strong. Fighting it is like 
doubling bets to get even on 
a crooked wheel." 

66TT MPH !” Slack handling. 

H Incredibly slack. It 
certainly was time a man who 
knew his own mind took over. 

The satellite was orbiting. 
He had taken an anti-hypno- 
sis pill. So too, although he 
hadn’t bothered to tell them 
about it, had Viola and Gar- 
ten, in their coffee. “Well, 
Captain. Your problems with 
Nirva are over. I — ” he drew 
himself up in full executive- 
command stance — “am going 
to straighten the place out. In 
five weeks, when you return 
to pick us up, you will find 
Nirva, under my administra- 
tion, a sound, sensible, stable 
colony. And we three will all 
return with you.” 

“Oh?” The captain was a 
skeptic. 

“Of course,” said Viola, 
“When my husband says a 
thing will be done, you can 
count it done.” 



“And this other gentleman, 
Secast Garten?” 

“Naturally, sir. S e c a d 
Screed is a man of his word. 
Not even Nirva could alter 
his determination.” 

“I see. Well, I’m not a bet- 
ting man, of course. Regula- 
tions. But if I were — ” 

“Yes, Captain?” S e c a d 
Screed’s voice cracked icily. 

“I would like to bet a year’s 
salary that all three of you 
won’t go back with me.” 
“Well, Captain. As Senior 
Service Officer aboard, I make 
the regulations here. I’ll just 
take that bet. A year’s salary, 
against yours. Nice odds for 
you there, Captain. That is a 
bet. Garten, you and Viola 
are witness.” 

The Captain smiled sourly 
and nodded. Screed turned on 
his heel, annoyed. “Come 
Viola; Garten.” Viola bowed 
her head and followed. Gar- 
ten lingered a minute. 

“Captain? If you’d care to 
hedge a bit of that bet, I’ll 
take, say, half of it?” 

The captain looked at him. 
An ordinary man. Not young, 
not old; not big, not small. 
Just a man, almost extraor- 
dinarily ordinary. And cer- 
tainly not too bright since, 
as he clearly intended to stay 
on Nirva, what good would it 
do him to win half of that old 
snake Screed’s bet? The Cap- 
tain shook his head. “Thanks, 
Secast Garten, but since you 
won’t — well. No, thanks, I’ll 
keep it.”

WILLIAM W. STUART 




Garten shrugged regretful- 
ly. “So? Well, I could use 
the money but no matter. I 
think you have a good bet, 
Captain. It’s my bet, too.” 
A half hour and the ship 
settled gently on the surface 
of the planet. The three pas- 
sengers for Nirva were ready 
at the air-lock. 

“Down screen /” 

Screed heard the words 
over the intercom. For a mo- 
ment a sense of confusion, of 
uncertainty of purpose touch- 
ed with dizzying, empty fear, 
swept over him. Abruptly it 
was gone. Confidence, more 
certain and invincible than 
ever, flooded back. He knew 
what he must do. And he 
knew that he would surely do 
it. 

A thrill of anticipatory tri- 
umph brought a little twisted 
smile to his thin lips but, half 
turning his head toward Vi- 
ola and Garten, all he said 
was, peremptorily, “Come.” 

T HEY stood, three small 
figures, on the surface of 
Nirva, the dream planet, be- 
side the space ship. 

They were edged away from 
it by a discomforting mental 
pressure as the ship’s force 
field snapped back on. Nirva. 
It seemed nothing so much. 
Pleasant enough, perhaps, but 
in a shockingly disordered, 
unimproved sort of way. 
Much the sort of thing Screed 
had expected. 

There was a bright sun 

OUT OF MIND 



overhead with a slight rosy- 
pink tint to it, low green hills 
and some sort of town or set- 
tlement in the near distance. 
The sky was a deep blue, al- 
most purple, dotted with 
feathery, pinkish clouds. All 
right. Probably it was quite 
suitable for exploitation as an 
agricultural planet. Not too 
much quick profit in it, per- 
haps, but well worth salvage. 

Screed, Viola and Garten 
were standing near the cen- 
ter of a cleared field, possibly 
a bungled excuse for a space 
port. Across it, a ramshackle 
building leaned tiredly to one 
side. As the space ship rose 
silently behind them, some 
sort of wheeled vehicle started 
toward them from the build- 
ing, raising a small cloud of 
pinkish-white dust as it came. 

“How awful,” said Viola, 
echoing Screed’s thoughts. 
“It’s so shamefully rundown 
and neglected looking.” 

“A Galactic disgrace,” 
agreed Garten from the other 
side. 

“So,” said Secad Screed, 
the leader. “You see?” 

The native vehicle, a rattle- 
trap affair reminiscent of an- 
cient earth internal combus- 
tion wagons, clattered up. 
The driver was unclearly hu- 
man under a slovenly, un- 
kempt exterior ; has was also 
middle-aged, fat and anxious 
as he stumbled out. “Ah,” he 
said eagerly, “distinguished 
visitors! And — uh — is it pos- 
sible — that is, I mean to say, 

41 




I — we all in fact, wonder if it 
could be you who is responsi- 
ble for the sudden, total 
change that seems to have af- 
fected our — ah — perceptive 

climate?” 

“And if we are,” snapped 
Screed, “it was certainly a de- 
generative situation that des- 
perately needed changing. 
You and all your people 
should thank me for it. And 
you will.” 

“Oh yes,” said the native. 
“We already do, indeed. But — 
uh — the thing is, not that we 
aren’t grateful for the awak- 
ening, but it is all so horribly 
confusing to us. You see, 
what I mean to say, we don’t 
know exactly what — ” 

“You need leadership ! 
Strong, efficient leadership.” 
“That’s it exactly. If only 
you would — ” 

“I shall.” He made an ex- 
pansive, condescending ges- 
ture. “I, with the help of Mrs. 
Screed — I, by the way, am 
Secad Screed, the Leader — 
and my assistant, will take 
full command of all admini- 
stration immediately. You 
will find that I will soon whip 
you into shape.” 

“Ah, sir, how can we ever 
repay you ?” 

“Perhaps something may be 
worked out. Now, we must 
get started. Take me at once 
to your ruling body.” 

“Ah. Do you suppose the 
Council of Dreamers — ?” 
“Hmph; just the sort of 
thing we shall have done with 

OUT OF MIND 



once and for all. But we must 
start someplace, I suppose. 
Let us proceed.” 

They all climbed somewhat 
apprehensively into the ve- 
hicle. They proceeded. 

Screed proceeded. 

H E proceeded, with Viola 
and Garten cheering and 
trailing along some little dis- 
tance to the rear, to carry out 
his total plan. It was almost 
too easy. 

“Almost,” thought Screed 
as the obedient, grateful cit- 
izens of Nirva labored fran- 
tically to remake their world 
into a model Class II, Galactic 
Service AgPlan. “But then, 
no one else could ever make 
a start here. It is siihply that, 
to a mind and character like 
mine, all things are easy.” 
He was, not for the first 
time, mildly surprised at his 
own brilliance, and totally ad- 
miring. 

Perhaps he was justified. 
Certainly both Viola and the 
sometimes cynical seeming 
Garten were all awed respect. 
The reformation of Nirva ad- 
vanced at a remarkable pace. 
The people, rudely awakened 
from a generations-long 
dream, were confused, aim- 
less, purposeless. Like the be- 
wildered representative at the 
space port, they wanted noth- 
ing more than a firm leader 
to give them direction. Hav- 
ing apparently no will of their 
own, they went to work with 
a will. Screed’s will. 



43 




Screed was pleasantly sur- 
prised. It seemed that before 
the development of the 
“dream world of the group 
mind,” some five hundred 
years before, they had been a 
progressive people with a 
modestly advanced technolo- 
gy. With the group mind, all 
of the old knowledge and tech- 
nical abilities had, quite inad- 
vertently, been passed on 
from generation to genera- 
tion. Direction was all they 
needed. Having no power of 
resistance, they accepted it 
with total obedience. When 
Screed said, as he often did, 
“You people are not here to 
think; you’re here to do what 
I tell you,” they smiled in 
whole-hearted agreement and 
did just what he hold them. 
It was delightful. 

In five short weeks the re- 
construction of Nirva was 
well advanced. New cities and 
smoke-belching factories were 
rising from old ruins. Fields 
were plowed and sowed. 

And the space ship came 
back. 

R eluctantly screed 

cut short a series of final 
instruction conferences with 
his newly appointed deputy 
directors and administrators. 
He picked up Viola and Gar- 
ten from their quarters in 
the refurbished ruin of an 
ancient mansion on a hill 
overlooking the new capital 
and they rode to the space 
port in his vehicle, primitive 

44 



in design but gleaming, shin- 
ing like new in the rosy-pink 
sunshine. 

The citizenry lined the 
roadway, torn between sobs 
and cheers. Screed, smiling, 
and sternly gracious, waved a 
regretful farewell. At the 
ship he paused for a last word 
with his senior deputy. In 
unfamiliar tones of anxious 
concern, he said, “Now, you 
have all my memos and in- 
structions. You’re sure you 
can handle it? Carry on just 
the way I have directed ?” 
“Of course, glorious su- 
preme leader. In your wis- 
dom you have pointed us the 
way. We shall not stray.” 
“Well — everything has been 
going well, very well. In a 
way I hate to leave and take 
the chance on your fouling 
everything up.” 

“We shall do our poor best, 
great leader.” 

“Yes,” said Screed, doubt- 
fully. “True enough. But 
even so — ” 

They could feel the space 
ship’s screen cut off. The port 
opened. 

From the vast crowd of 
Nirvans spread across the 
space port there came a great 
whispering noisp, something 
between a sigh and a moan of 
sad farewell, as Screed turned 
and followed the other two 
through the port and into the 
ship. 

“Ah, Captain,” said Screed, 
smiling a thin smile of tri- 
umph. “You doubted my abil- 

WIU.IAM W. STUART 




ity to remake Nirva. But now 
you have seen it. Quite a 
change, eh?” 

“Oh sure. Quite a change. 
Of course, there always is.” 
“And, Captain, you will 
note that we are all here. All 
three of us. You have, I fear, 
lost your bet.” 

The Captain shrugged. 
“Better get to your cabin 
now, ready for take off.” 

In the cabin Screed settled 
back in a chair and looked up 
at the other two with an odd 
air of defiance. “All right,” 
he said, “I did it, didn’t I? 
Just the way I told you.” 
“Screen on,” said the Cap- 
tain over the intercom. 

To the three in the cabin 
the air seemed to turn shim- 
mery, hazy, indistinct for a 
moment. Then it cleared. 

Garten and Viola stood by 
the doorway, arm in arm, 
staring. Screed, Secad Screed, 
the leader, was gone. 

MrriHERE,” said Garten 
JL with deep satisfaction, 
“He did do it.” 

Viola sighed, smiling. “Dar- 
ling! He did! It worked just 
the way you said it would. 
But I’m still not sure I quite 
understand why — or how.” 
“It doesn’t really matter. 
But — you noticed he quit tak- 
ing the anti-hypnotic pills af- 
ter the first week?” 

“Yes. Did that make any 
difference ? The satellite work- 
ed, didn’t it? And everything 
else went just the way he 

OUT OF MIND 



wanted it. It all seemed per- 
fect — for him.” 

“Sure it did. And that was 
what he couldn’t face losing.” 
“Hmm?” 

“Well, it seemed that every- 
thing went exactly the way 
he imagined it would. The 
satellite worked. The people 
followed him. Everything. 
But maybe we all only imag- 
ined it. How can we be sure? 
After all, those things — plus 
our purely personal concerns 
that he was far too busy to 
take any note of — ” 

Viola blushed, quite charm- 
ingly for a plain, mousy little 
woman. 

“ — were what we were ex- 
pecting too. How can we 
know, for sure, what was real 
and what was illusion?” 

Viola looked suddenly of- 
fended. 

“About the planet, I mean.” 
Viola looked mollified. 

“But the planet — I think 
Screed is running the thing; 
I’m not sure. As long as he 
is there, he knows he is run- 
ning it. Here — who knows? 
That was the chance he 
couldn’t take, the chance his 
mind refused to face. If he 
were here, could he still be 
sure he was right?” 

Viola smiled the feminine 
smile that dismisses a ques- 
tion no longer of personal con- 
sequence and snuggled closer 
to Garten. “Well,” she said, 
“at least we know he isn’t 
here. That’s all that matters.”

A 

SCIENCE FACTION 

STORY 

It isn't science FICTION . 
and it isn't fact YET . 
but it will be) 



S CIENCE fiction heroes go 
into space for a limited 
number of reasons, and the 
least of them seems to be to 
make a buck. About the time 
the reader began to get tired 
of ships bashing around in 
space for no ascertainable 
reason except to give the bug- 
eyed monster a chance to make 
a pass at the Earth girl, the 
writers began to rationalize 
their presence there. We then 
had our full measure of the 
Everest wheeze: why do you 
want to conquer the stars, 
Daddy? Because they’re there. 
Endless processions of girl 
scientists rebuffed bug-eyed 
hordes until rescued by regi- 

46 



ments of space-burned swag- 
gerers who were initially in- 
spired only by the existence of 
Challenge. Then there was the 
hero, usually as space-burned 
as the BEM - bombers, out 
there after Truth. 

That the search was expen- 
sive was sometimes not men- 
tioned and sometimes not de- 
nied. Occasionally a plot de- 
manded that it become a fac- 
tor, and who was to pick up 
the tab became that technical- 
ity known to writing courses 
as the Obstacle. But cost, in- 
vestment, return — these were 
not for a long time the other 
technicality known as Motive. 

A SCIENCE FACTION STORY 





Then along came the aster- 
oid miner, bless his horny- 
handed heart, and along with 
him some urgently - needed 
characterization. At long last 
someone was doing what you 
did when you started that 
ouija-board factory, or what- 
ever it is you do when you’re 
not reading IF. Someone was 
getting up a stake, learning 
how, taking his lumps, acquir- 
ing some skills and coming 
back with something to show 
for it. A lot of these old men 
named Pop were homespun — 
and vice versa — to the verge 
of vertigo, but at least they, 
and their cousins the traders, 
worked for a living in a way 
we could feel we understood. 
And that's why they were out 
there. 

As we became more sophis- 
ticated, “our” space began to 
be populated with criminals 
on the lam, espers, idealistic 
anthropologists anxious to in- 
terfere with alien cultures 
without interfering, playgirls 
in space-yachts and cowboys 
who did the walkdown on De- 
neb instead of Dakota. Extra- 
polation of certain of our cur- 
rent money-making devices, 
like advertising, show-biz en- 
terprise, lawyering and mon- 
gering real-estate, produced 
quite a crop of astonishingly 
good yarns and a great many 
differing only in setting from 
the outland oater, of Tonto- 
on-Titan type. But at their 
best they all depended on some 
established cultural matrix — 



a League or Empire or Corps 
or Corporation within which 
to function. Ways to make 
space pay off had already been 
found and the story took place 
long after that had ceased to 
be a problem. 

V ERY few, then, are the 
examples of space science 
fiction which base themselves 
on reasonable, product-or-ser- 
vice, investment - and - return 
bases. It would seem that 
space flight is by its very na- 
ture not an area in which one 
can earn a dollar. Unless, of 
course, you put it another way 
and say that whoever can find 
a way to make it pay is going 
to turn himself a classic buck. 

If you thought that space 
flight was doomed to ride sole- 
ly on the shining shoulders of 
Challenge, Adventure, Nation- 
al Hardware and the Search 
for Truth, you were right 
clear up to (as such things 
go) yesterday. Obviously, it 
was time for someone to come 
up with a way to make space 
flight pay in some other cur- 
rency, like maybe Money. 
Since the crisis is supposed to 
produce the man, where is he? 

Well, he’s in and around 
Murray Hill, New Jersey; he 
used to write science fiction 
under the name of J. J. Coup- 
ling; his real name is Dr. John 
Pierce, he’s the Director of 
Research, Communications 
Principles, at Bell Labs and, 
finally, he bosses the project 
which put the famous Echo 



THEODORE STURGEON 



47 




satellite up there where you 
can see it with your own un- 
abashedly naked eye. 

Echo, as you know, is a 100- 
foot aluminized balloon from 
which radio signals may be 
bounced. It is, it is hoped, the 
precursor of a whole family 
of satellites which will be used 
for communications; and not 
since George 0. Smith wrote 
his Venus Equilateral series 
(and excepted himself from 
our initial sweeping state- 
ments) has there been such 
an ingenious and breath-tak- 
ing effort. 

Echo is a “passive” satellite. 
That is, it has no guts of its 
own, but merely serves as a 
bouncer-backer, with a secon- 
dary function as an aid to 
visual and radio navigation. 
One plan is to place three of 
them some 24,000 miles out, 
on the plane of the equator 
(Geosmith’s “equilateral” 
idea) and so placed that each 
would be over its same spot 
of Earth at all times. Signals 
could then be relayed instan- 
taneously from and to any 
spot on earth. 

But Pierce and Bell Labs 
will probably do nothing of 
the kind, for they already have 
something better in mind. 
“Courier” is an “active” satel- 
lite and it’s just full of guts. 
Couriers can talk to each other 
and to the ground. They can 
pick up whole encyclopedias 
of information at a seconds- 
long gulp, hang on to it for 45 
minutes and then burp it out 

48 



on the other side of the world 
on command. And nobody 
need know what was said ex- 
cept the persons concerned. 
They can catch a signal, am- 
plify it, throw it to another 
Courier which throws it to 
another which can then beam 
it to the ground. It means TV 
linkage round the world. It 
means UN meetings without 
hassels about hotels. It means 
a great new surge in the cur- 
rent of people’s identification 
with people the world around. 
It means education and inter- 
cultural exchange — it means, 
in short, communication in the 
widest, deepest sense of the 
word. 

And among the most fasci- 
nating aspects of it is that 
Bell Labs is not doing it for 
Adventure or Challenge. They 
have facts and figures to prove 
what submarine cables, plus 
land lines, plus radio-relay 
systems would cost to achieve 
even a part of such communi- 
cations. By comparison Couri- 
er, by half-dozen lots, is for 
peanuts. 

They can also prove that 
they can make such a system 
pay money, whatever else it 
may do for the so-called great- 
er good. 

N OW comes (another writ- 
ers’ technical term) the 
Complication, a plot-switch 
worthy of a Heinlein or may- 
be even a William Tenn. For 
just to prove that history, in 
providing a man for a crisis, 

A SCIENCE FACTION STORY 




is generous, here come Messrs. 
Morrow and Meyer, under the 
aegis of MIT and the Air 
Force's Air Research and De- 
velopment Command, with a 
method to provide TV, radio, 
and teletype communication 
between anywhere and any- 
where else on Earth. Further, 
they claim that they will re- 
quire only two small and com- 
paratively simple rockets, and 
they will need no special 
tracking equipment nor high- 
precision transmitting and re- 
ceiving antennas. They say 
their system will handle many 
more channels than a commu- 
nications satellite (but they 
didn’t say what kind) and 
that they can achieve the 
same reflective power as Echo 
with just a handful (9 ounces, 
to be exact) of hair. 

Their idea is to put up a 
man-made ionosphere, which 
will bounce radio waves from 
point to point of itself, and 
to Earth, the way the natural 
one does. But theirs would not 
billow and shift, thin out and 
thicken, nor would it be af- 
fected by sunspots and mag- 
netic storms. It would not 
ever envelope the Earth, but 
consist instead of two thin 
bands, 5 miles wide and 20 
miles deep, 6000 miles from 
Earth, one band on a polar 
orbit and the other over the 
equator. 

And of course it is not real- 
ly hair. It will consist of tiny 
slivers of copper, half as thick 
as the very finest human hair 

THEODORE STURGEON 



and barely half an inch long. 
Such tiny threads will orbit 
just as contentedly as a plastic 
bubble or a dead Russian. 
And these two rings will op- 
erate, they tell us, with quality 
as high, comparatively, as the 
cost is low, by the ^technique 
known as “ionospheric scat- 
ter." 

The issue, then, as we who 
are s-f oriented see it, is what 
happens when (and IF) Bell 
Labs, which is no welter- 
weight, touches gloves with 
the Air Force and then be- 
gins to debate who puts up 
what, and to whom the 
credit goes. 

Speaking fictionally, you un- 
derstand, and strictly in the 
World of IF, we nod our heads 
in a pleased way if one system 
proves best and is used, and 
we cry congratulations if the 
other wins out and is used. 

But if we were writing this 
plot we would look at the pos- 
sibility of one system’s prov- 
ing superior, and the decision 
going to the other party. That 
would be what the writer calls 
Crisis. That would be when 
we stopped saying IF and 
started yelling why? And 
what followed would be the 
thing called Denouement, or, 
whoever dreamed it would 
Come out this way? 

What this means, if a sys- 
tem is established which actu- 
ally pays off in money, is truly 
what Robert Heinlein so viv- 
idly called The End of The 
Beginning. END

didn't trust him. Sooner or later I knew he’d insult mel 



The 

Connoisseur 



By FRANK BANTA 

r r is infinitely more satisfac- 
tory to purchase wives when 
they are young. They are vast- 
ly more respectfuL 
Twelve is a good purchasing 
age. Lisa was twelve when I 
bargained for her, and she is 
an illustrious argument for 
the system. 

I recall her excellent father 
and I facing each other across 
his gleaming synthol marble 
table that day. On the table 
were small metal shells of 
sweet liquor. And beside the 
shells were the sedulously 
gathered treasures I was for- 
mally offering for Lisa: A 
control knob, and a folded 
painting of one of our Navi- 

50 



gator’s other-ship visions. 

Lisa’s father eagerly ex- 
amined the mirror-bright, 
chrome surface of the control 
knob — which I had handed 
to him with a pretense of 
casualness — trying to still 
the trembling of his fingers. 

“The last knob on the con- 
trol board !” he said in an emo- 
tion-cracked voice. “How could 
you have broken it off? We’ve 
all been tugging at it for 
years.’’ 

I answered — I hope with 
no more than legitimate pride 
— “I managed to get a thin 
hacksaw blade between the 
knob and the control board. 
Then I sawed off the shaft.’’ 





He nodded approvingly. 
“With knuckle - headed men 
like you aboard ship we will 
certainly all go to Hell.” 

I bowed, but I did not let 
his flattery relax my caution. 
After all, we were bargaining 
for his prettiest daughter. 
What flattering words bear 
weight in the midst of a sale? 
He, of course, referred to the 
ringing sincerity of our Navi- 
gator’s dying words: “If you 
knuckle-heads all want to go 
to Hell, just keep dismantling 
the ship!” 

Swinging adroitly to my 
other item of barter, I mused 
aloud, “Our Navigator! What 
a strange, frantic creature he 
was. Full of the wild, lovely 
visions which effervesced from 
his books of fantasy. Implor- 
ing us not only to read the 
books but to believe them — 
and, failing that, drawing im- 
mortal paintings of the fan- 
tasies for us to see.” 

T herewith i opened the 

folded painting and hand- 
ed it reverently to him. It 
showed a large globular ship 
with people living on the out- 
side of it. The title of the 
painting was Planet. 

, Privately I had always 
thought the thing was wholly 
unnatural — a curious off- 
beat of the master’s imagina- 
tion. I was quite willing, de- 
spite its great beauty and its 
origin^ to exchange it for 
something which to me was 
far more attractive at the mo- 



ment. Namely a woman. 

Lisa lay curled up on the 
narrow, in-wall couch, with 
her head propped up by a slim 
arm. She chewed her synthel- 
gum lazily and surveyed me 
with mild interest. She was a 
tender-f e a t u r e d girl, with 
shimmering black, shoulder- 
length hair. It was possible 
to forecast that she would 
some day be a lovely and 
gentle-hearted woman. 

Her father, notwithstanding 
his habitually rigid integrity, 
saw my lively interest in her 
and tried to increase my gen- 
erous bid for her by an arti- 
fice of delay. 

Holding the painting of the 
master at arm’s length, he 
grumbled critically, “A vision 
of Hell would have been more 
to my liking. Unhappily our 
Navigator did not paint one 
of his radiant visions of that 
ship. Now, why would he pre- 
fer Planet to Hell — particu- 
larly when he described Hell 
as warm and enclosed like our 
own ship?” 

I did not answer his frivo- 
lous complaint, knowing full 
well it was only bartering 
talk. 

He handled the immortal 
painting with crudely feigned 
indifference. He could not 
quite bring himself to let go 
of it. He was determined to 
own it, I knew, and he sensed 
also my resolve to offer no 
more for Lisa. Yet slyly he 
determined on an evil course. 

For, incredibly, he turned 

51 



THE CONNOISSEUR 




to tranquil Lisa and asked: 
“What is your value, lovely 
child? Does he offer enough?” 
And slowly lifting her can- 
did eyes to him she shook her 
head NO ! 

460 HALL I bargain with 
O her then?” I asked my 
friend caustically. I will own 
1 was vexed. 

Shrewdly he nodded. “What- 
ever she accepts will be our 
bargain.” Then, laughing at 
my undignified discomfiture, 
“It is manifest she is more 
aware of her value than I.” 
“Will you be serious? It 
is not kindly to banter with a 
woman-child in such an im- 
portant matter as her future.” 
But greed now fully pos- 
sessed him. “I do not joke. 
Whatever she demands shall 
be her price.” He sipped his 
sweet wine, hiding his eyes 
from my displeasure. 

Concealing my fury, I turn- 
ed to Lisa, who now sat up 
straight on the narrow couch 
with her long, slender legs 
folded under her. In the pace 
of grievous mortification I was 
not bitter toward her. It was 
not her fault. For her I ex- 
tended the tolerance due the 
innocent. 

“What is your cost, child?” 
I asked. “This control knob 
and other-ship vision of our 
Navigator are sufficient to 
purchase any girl-woman. 
What will you have?” 

Lisa chewed her gum slow- 
ly while she formed her se- 

52 



rene thought. Then, shaking 
her oval head, she let fall in 
a dreamy, singsong voice, 
“Neither of these! Neither of 
these !” 

Her father leaned forward 
anxiously. I told her, “There 
is a limit to your value. I will 
not give all of my treasures 
for you, lovely though you 
are. Choose what thing you 
will have, and if I can procure 
it, your father shall have it.” 
“I’ll know it when I see it!” 
she said, smiling impudently. 

T HERE was nothing for me 
to do but go to my apart- 
ments and look for other 
treasures to show her. My 
thoughts were exceedingly bit- 
ter as I gathered the coveted 
articles one by one in my 
arms. 

“Here.” I displayed it to 
her when I had arrived back 
at her father’s abode. “It is 
the steering wheel from the 
lifeboat. Feel its smooth tex- 
ture, see its ebony luster. It 
is the only lifeboat steering 
wheel aboard ship. I had a ter- 
rible struggle with it until I 
broke off the shaft.” 

She seemed interested. I 
passed huriedly on to another 
object. “Here is the handle of 
the atomic-pile damping rod. 
It was threaded inside. How- 
ever, I have managed to grind 
the interior smooth.” 

She seemed definitely inter- 
ested, but I did not linger. I 
unrolled the last treasure I 
had brought with me. At the 

FRANK BANTA 




sight of it he? father burst 
into merry chuckles. 

“Yes,” I said, smiling with 
a hint of sadness. “It is the 
inscrutable message we found 
protruding from the mouth 
of a machine some years ago. 
The machine has the name 
Teletype engraved upon it. We 
cannot imagine who put the 
message inside the machine 
— if indeed it is a message. 
But listen to the poetry of its 
words! I shall read it to you 
as though it were properly set 
out on paper instead of be- 
ing cramped into continuous, 
senseless lines: 

Colony ship, colony ship, 
Turn around before it is too 
late. 

You have left the Galaxy. 

We are the last planetary 
system 

You will encounter, 

For ten thousand years.” 

Then, seeing her puzzle- 
ment, I said hastily, “But, of 
course, it is too adult for you, 
Lisa. Its mystery is for the 
scholar, its abstract beauty 
for the man of mature years. 
Come, let us turn back to these 
other treasures . .” 

It was not easy for her to 
choose, seemingly, with so 
much wealth about her. The 
control knob, the painting, the 
life-boat steering wheel, the 
atomic-pile damping-rod han- 
dle, the inscrutable poetry — 
all claimed her interest. But 



in the end she chose as I want- 
ed her to, and the bargain 
was struck. 

List went to live in the 
compartment of my concu- 
bines that day, and at maturi- 
ty became a concubine of 
exotic beauty. She bore her 
dark-haired children well. 

B Y the excellence of her 
father, he and I continued 
to be good friends. At least 
once a year I invite him to 
view the master’s painting of 
Planet. We spend many con- 
tented hours together. Often 
through a porthole we watch 
the rapid movement of distant 
ships which our Navigator 
called stars, revolving in tiny 
circles at the side of the ship, 
making a complete circle in 
about two minutes. What 
prompts the behavior of these 
ships? It is all very curious, 
and I account myself fortu- 
nate that I have in my friend 
an intense capacity for spec- 
ulation. Like myself, he is a 
scholar of honor, capable of 
long sustained discourse on 
lofty subjects which round 
out and deepen the mind. I 
forgive him his greed. 

As I had intended, Lisa took 
the teletype nonsense message 
to be her value to her father. 
May I reiterate, it is infinitely 
more satisfactory to purchase 
wives when they are very 
young ladies? They are vastly 
more respectful. Admittedly 
they are saucy. end

T HE thing came down into 
atmosphere over Lake 
Michigan at a velocity 
that should have built shock 
waves before it; there were 
none. Radars at the Nike and 
fighter-interceptor sites along 
and near the shoreline swept 
their beams toward the thing 
in the course of their normal 
search routine. The hurtling 
electromagnetic pulses were 
detoured precisely around the 
thing, to resume on the other 
side their straight and echo- 
less flight. The thing was 
quite unseen. 

The descending mass, 
roughly spherical, hundreds 
of feet in diameter, slowed its 
plunge through the early sum- 
mer night of North America. 
It hit the lake with hardly a 
splash, miles from shore. 




The man was a stranger, and an alien, 
and perhaps he was dying. But Kelsey 
had to choose: He could save the stran- 
ger’s life — or he could save his own.

Not for the first time did it 
find concealment in the wa- 
ters of Earth. A few people of 
Earth had been aware of it. 
Now none of them remem- 
bered it. 

A JUNE day in Chicago can 
be uncomfortably hot. 
This particular day was too 
miserable, in the opinion of 
twenty year old Pete Kelsey, 
for him to spend it all sorting 
mail inside the Main Post Of- 
fice. Not if he could find a way 
out. Besides the heat, it was 
one of those days when he just 
didn’t feel like working. He 
didn’t quite know why. The 
job was really all right, 
though it didn’t pay too much. 
If he stuck with it, he would 
be able to retire in his early 
forties. 



But today Kelsey’s morning, 
spent running a canceling 
machine, had been gener- 
ally unpleasant; and he sus- 
pected from the way the mail 
was running that he would be 
assigned in the afternoon to 
a dim acre of the eighth floor, 
where long neglected bags 
and piles of low-class mail 
awaited a slackening of the 
first-class flow. It would be hot 
and chokingly dusty there. 
Kelsey decided to wangle half 
a day of his accumulated va- 
cation time. 

In an hour and a half he 
was in his rooming house on 
the North Side. Half an hour 
after that he was sitting in 
swimming trunks on one of 
the massive rocks that guard 
land from lake along stretches 
of Chicago’s park-and-beach

shoreline, clothing piled be- 
side him, transistor portable 
blaring something with a 
beat. 

He was almost alone, on the 
edge of the great city. The 
rocks rose like stairs for five 
or six tiers above where he 
sat near water level, shutting 
out the sight of green park 
and distant buildings. To right 
and left the rock rampart 
curved out and then away, at 
about a hundred yards from 
where he sat, putting him out 
of sight of the rest of the 
shoreline. Only two or three 
other people were in sight. 
Strolling in the cool lake 
breeze or sunbathing. 

If only some nice looking 
babe would come along now, 
to stretch out on the rocks for 
some sun . well, he would- 
n’t hold his breath while 
waiting for her. The water 
looked inviting. 

The beaches were not offi- 
cially open yet. He could have 
gone to one anyway, but he 
didn’t especially care for 
sand, or for wading a long 
way out to reach deep water. 
Here you could dive right in. 

He did. The water was 
cold, making him gasp as he 
surfaced. 

“Better than air condition- 
ing,” he told himself aloud, 
treading water happily. He 
stroked out a few yards from 
shore, an easy, confident 
swimmer. 

When he felt the tight sud- 
den grip on his foot his first 

56 



unthinking reaction was: A 
joke. One of the guys from 
work, somehow . There 
was a sting at his ankle . 

K ELSEY had not had time 
to get really frightened. 
When he woke, he was calm, 
but bewilderment came 
quickly. He was still in swim- 
ming trunks, and wet. 

He lay on his back on the 
floor of a small, square, win- 
dowless room, staring at a 
glowing ceiling that provided 
comfortable illumination. In 
the center of the ceiling was 
a metallic disk that looked like 
a closed door or hatch, with 
hinges at one side, and at the 
other small projections that 
might be an intricate latch. 

He rolled over dazedly. He 
had been swimming, and now 
... an old man lay stretched 
beside him, eyes closed, 
breathing heavily, dressed in 
rags and thinly bearded. The 
old man’s features were Ori- 
ental — Chinese, or maybe Ja- 
panese. Kelsey had never 
learned to tell the difference. 
Kelsey stood up. 

He felt fine, but where was 
he? Nothing looked familiar. 
The little room held no furni- 
ture. Floor and walls were 
some featureless neutral-col- 
ored stuff he could not iden- 
tify. Set into one wall was a 
niche like a sort of berth, pos- 
sibly just big enough for some- 
one Kelsey’s size to squeeze 
into. A transparent sliding 
door, now half open, sepa- 

FRED SABERHAGEN 




rated berth from room. 

He looked down at the old 
man, found him scrawny and 
ugly and generally unhealthy 
looking. Maybe' when the old 
man woke up he could tell 
what this was all about. 

This was an odd, silent 
place. Kelsey paced around, 
somehow expecting every mo- 
ment to get an explanation 
from somewhere. In one wall, 
just below the low ceiling, air 
circulated gently through a 
grill with darkness behind it. 
In one corner of the floor, a 
six-inch hole showed the in- 
side of a pipe, leading down 
into more darkness. 

Kelsey investigated the 
berth-like niche; its door slid 
in grooves cut into a material 
that looked like rubber, but 
felt smooth as melting ice. In 
the top of the berth was an- 
other closed hatch, exactly 
like the one in the room’s ceil- 
ing. 

He sat on the edge of the 
berth, scratching his damp 
head and regarding his un- 
conscious companion. 

The utter craziness of the 
whole business began to soak 
in on him. He had been swim- 
ming ... He remembered 
the grab and sting at his an- 
kle. There was no mark, no 
soreness. 

He looked up at the hatch 
in the ceiling. Was he in a 
submarine? He had never 
been aboard any kind of ship. 
He searched his memory for 
data from movie and televi- 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



sion scenes ; what he could re- 
member didn’t help any. He 
formed a vague picture of 
kidnapping Russian frogmen. 
He wished he could wake up 
and And this was all a dream. 

T HE hatch in the ceiling 
was easy to reach, but 
getting it open was another 
matter. After trying for about 
a minute, Kelsey quit in an- 
noyance and attempted to 
wake the old man. 

The old guy didn’t respond 
to gentle shaking. Was he 
drunk? Didn’t some Chinese 
still use opium or something? 
Kelsey shook harder. 

“Hey,” he called, self-con- 
sciously, his own voice sound- 
ing strange in the silence 
around him. “Wake up!” he 
said, louder. The old man’s 
head wobbled on his thin 
neck with the shaking. He 
breathed. He stayed out. 

Kelsey sat on the floor. May- 
be the old guy was in bad 
shape. He would wait a while 
and try to think this out. 

Without warning water 
began to fountain up from 
the pipe-opening in the floor, 
in a jet that carried to ceiling 
height and filled the room an- 
kle deep in seconds. 

After one paralyzed mo- 
ment Kelsey jumped up and 
pounded on the ceiling hatch, 
yelling for help. The only an- 
swer was the continued 
splashing roar in the room. 

Remembering the old man, 
Kelsey spun around. Rising 

57 




water framed the wrinkled 
face. Kelsey -jumped to him 
and lifted him, surprised at 
the weight he felt. He would 
have to keep the old man 
afloat with one hand while he 
tried to get the hatch open 
. only now did he notice 
with horror the heavy metal 
chains that bound the old 
man’s limbs, nearly concealed 
by the ragged garments. 
There would be no keeping 
him afloat! 

Water lapped around Kel- 
sey’s knees. Was it going to 
fill the room? The old man 
. Kelsey thought of the 
berth. He dragged the thin 
weighted body there, lifted 
and crammed it in, slid the 
transparent door shut. It 
looked like it might be water- 
proof. 

There was no possibility of 
getting in himself, unless he 
left the old man out to drown 
— the thought flitted across 
his mind, found itself in alien 
territory, and fled. 

Kelsey went back to the 
ceiling hatch, wading through 
water that was waist deep 
and still rising rapidly. He 
tried to work at the latch me- 
thodically, but panic grabbed 
at his fingers and made them 
fumble. The water reached 
his chest. Would it drain out 
through the ventilator when 
it got high enough? Would it 
leave him any air space? He 
could drown in this room. He 
was going to drown in this 
room. 

58 



He looked around wildly. 
The old man lay peacefully 
behind his transparent door, 
dry, like an exhibit in some 
reversed aquarium. There was 
another hatch in the berth, 
another way out . but no, 
the hatch in the berth was no 
different from this one, no 
use risking two lives. 

“Help !” Kelsey shouted. 
The water had reached the 
ventilator and kept right on 
rising. Soon the room would 
be full; Kelsey was swim- 
ming now. “Help !” He 
twisted at the latch. 

The latch stung his hand. 

K ELSEY woke up again. 

He lay with his eyes shut 
for a little while; there was 
something frightening he 
might see when he opened 
them. He could not remember 
at first what it was . 

He sat up with a jerk. But 
he was not drowning now, 
although still wet and in 
swimming trunks. 

The room was not the same 
one, but similar. Same glow- 
ing ceiling, same ventilator, 
but no berth. Again a closed 
hatch, or door, this time in 
one wall instead of the ceil- 
ing. 

Another hatch, in the floor, 
stood open. Kelsey crawled to 
it and looked down into the 
room where he had nearly 
drowned. It was empty of wa- 
ter now, but the floor still 
gleamed wetly. The sliding 
door to the berth was open; 

FRED SABERHAGEN 




the old man was nowhere in 
sight. 

Kelsey sat with his legs 
dangling through the open 
hatch, trying to make sense of 
it all. He couldn’t remember 
climbing up from the lower 
room, or even getting the 
hatch open. The latch had 
stung his hand in a gentle 
way, leaving no mark or sore- 
ness, as something had earlier 
stung his ankle. Each time he 
had been knocked out. 

Had someone, pulled him up 
here? He looked around ner- 
vously. Was he being watched 
from somewhere? 

He couldn’t just sit think- 
ing about it. He gripped the 
edge of the hatch and lowered 
himself easily back into the 
first room, noticing as he did 
so how well he felt physically. 
He examined the compart- 
ment where he had left the 
old man. Where the hatch had 
been in the top of it was now 
a flat metal plate that he could 
not move with his fingers. He 
pushed and pounded and 
yelled some more, with no re- 
sult. 

The ceiling-glow died sud- 
denly in this lower room ; the 
only light now shone down 
through the open hatch from 
the room above. 

Was someone telling him 
to move up there ? 

He climbed up without dif- 
ficulty. He went to the closed 
door in the wall and pushed 
at it uselessly; this one had 
no latch, but an opening that 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



looked like an odd keyhole. In 
a small rack beside the door 
hung ten or twelve odd- 
shaped metal sticks. 

Half-heartedly, Kelsey tried 
a few more yells and listened 
to the waiting silence. Well, 
he could sit around until some- 
thing happened. Or he could 
continue to work on the door. 
He couldn’t think of any other 
course. 

He took some of the metal 
sticks from the little rack and 
studied them. They all looked 
as if they would fit the door’s 
keyhole, but no two were 
shaped exactly alike. He chose 
one at random, and tried it in 
the door. 

H IS hand got a nasty, grat- 
ing shock, unlike electric- 
ity, unlike the previous gentle 
knockout stings. He dropped 
the key and at the same in- 
stant heard water gushing 
up in the room below. Kelsey 
slammed the floor hatch down 
and sat on it. Should he try 
to stop the flood by putting 
another key in the door? His 
hand still tingled; he decided 
not. Was he being punished 
in some crazy way for trying 
to open the door, by someone 
controlling all this, or was he 
just caught in a chain of ac- 
cidents ? 

Soon the muffled water- 
sound stopped. Gingerly he 
eased the hatch open ; the bot- 
tom face of it turned up drip- 
ping wet. The room below was 
full and brimming over. 



59 




He didn’t like this at all. 
Could the room he was now 
in be flooded too? He closed 
the hatch and saw with hor- 
ror that a little water came 
seeping up through it, as if 
the hatch were made of blot- 
ting paper. Yet it looked and 
felt like hard metal. 

He decided to try the door 
again, shock or no shock. It 
was better than just waiting 
here, to maybe drown if the 
water rose again. 

He took another key. He 
decided to peel off his trunks 
and try using them for insula- 
tion when he held the key and 
tried it in the door . but 
maybe he could do better than 
that. 

Wasn’t one key enough to 
open a door? Why have so 
many in the rack? Starting to 
think, he really saw another 
detail for the first time : 
marked above the door was a 
small number 7. 

He had noticed it before 
without thinking about it; 
you saw numbers all the time, 
on doors and lots of other 
places. But maybe a key 
would be numbered 7. 

There were small numbers 
engraved on each of the ten 
keys, but each key bore a 
number of two or three digits ; 
there was no number 7. 

Kelsey looked more closely 
at the door. Near the keyhole 
ran a series of numbers in the 
same neat engraving borne 
by the keys : 2 6 14 30. None 
of the numbers matched a 



key’s number. Yet he thought 
there must be some connec- 
tion. 2 6 14 30 ... he sat 
comparing numbers for what 
seemed about five minutes be- 
fore something clicked in his 
memory, taking him back to 
the intelligence tests he had 
experienced in high school. A 
series of numbers . com- 
plete the logical sequence, the 
instructions had said. It was 
one of those things that teach- 
ers thought up to make the 
smart kids feel good, he had 
told himself at the time, 
knowing that he himself 
wasn’t a smart kid.. He hadn’t 
tried very hard at the test, 
feeling there was no point in 
it. But when they showed him 
the results, he hadn’t done 
badly at all, in fact a little 
better than average all along 
the line. 

That had surprised him, 
because he had never done 
very well in school. He had 
never wanted to, because most 
of the kids he knew sort of 
sneered at guys who were 
brains, and the uncle he lived 
with was always talking 
down book learning and col- 
lege guys who thought they 
knew a lot. His aunt had never 
said much about it one way 
or the other. 

The numbers: 2 6 14 30. 
Complete the logical sequence. 
Well, it was worth a try. 6 
was 3 times 2. 14 was — no. 

Each number was larger 
than the one before it. Not 
double; 2 times 2 was 4, you 



60 



FRED SABERHAGEN 




had to add 2 more to get 6. 
2 times 6 was 12, you had to 
add 2 . 

“Yeah!” he said aloud. He 
ran through the whole series 
in his nrud, twice, to be sure. 
He looked for, and found, a 
key numbered 62. There was 
nothing to be gained by wait- 
ing. He drew a deep breath 
and inserted it. 

T HE door opened easily; 

there was no sting, and 
no sound of water from be- 
low. Kelsey let out breath 
with a relieved whoof. 

The room beyond the door 
was quite similar to the one 
in which he stood. As he 
stepped through he found 
himself facing another door, 
this one with a number 6 
above it. He was certain be- 
fore he tried it that it was 
locked. 

On the wall near door 6, 
beside a key rack, was a tiny 
shelf holding a stack of pa- 
pers. Kelsey riffled through 
the papers. Pages from some 
kind of textbook on English. 
He thought that nothing he 
found could surprise him any 
more. 

Engraved beside the new 
door’s keyhole was the word : 
ADVERB. Kelsey suspected 
there would not be a key 
marked ADVERB, and he 
was right. But each key did 
have a word on it. 

Was some crazy school- 
teacher running this place? 
He pictured some old maid, 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



driven batty by years in a 
classroom, inheriting a for- 
tune and — nuts. 

But memories of school re- 
turned once more, informing 
him that an adverb was one 
of those things called the parts 
of speech. He supposed that 
various teachers had tortured 
him with the parts of speech 
at least a hundred times dur- 
ing his twelve years of school- 
ing. How could he ever need 
to know what an adverb was? 
Well, he did now. 

Kelsey reached for the 
pages of English textbook 
and searched through them 
carefully until he found a list 
of words exemplifying the 
category ADVERB. None of 
the words on the keys were in 
the list. He would have to 
think about the category 
ADVERB and decide which 
key-word fitted it. 

He did. 

Again the door opened eas- 
ily for his chosen key. He was 
not surprised at the sight of 
another similar room, and 
the number 5 above another 
door. Almost jauntily he 
walked directly across the new 
room to study door 5 for a 
small engraved symbol. 

He found the letter H, 
which might stand for a lot 
of things. 

This time the shelf beside 
the door was large, holding 
books, wires, and glass in va- 
rious shapes that reminded 
him of what he had seen in 
his occasional glimpses from 

61 




the hallway of the high school 
chemistry lab. A small metal 
tub held a clear odorless liq- 
uid that might be water, from 
the lack of smell. Careful, 
now, he warned himself. But 
he didn’t feel thirsty yet. 

There was no keyhole in 
door 5. A simple latch was 
sealed under a casing of some 
clear substance that resisted 
Kelsey’s pushing fingers like 
iron. 

He sighed. He would have 
to play it by the book, and the 
books on the shelf were thick 
and formidable-looking vol- 
umes. A glance showed him 
they were physics and chem- 
istry texts. He groaned. 

From somewhere in the 
rooms behind him came a 
watery gurgle. 

ELL, there was no use 
just sitting here, and 
nothing else to do but keep 
trying to figure a way out. 
This chemistry business here 
looked far too hard for him 
to solve, but it would at least 
give him something to do. 

First, the symbol on the 
door. A book told him that H 
represented the element hy- 
drogen. He discovered that it 
was possible to produce hydro- 
gen from water, given elec- 
tricity and suitable appara- 
tus. These were provided, the 
electricity from an ordinary- 
looking wall outlet. On the 
shelf was a glass tube of pe- 
culiar shape that seemed de- 
signed to convey the newly 

62 



released hydrogen to the seal 
holding the latch. The little 
tub was marked ILO, which 
he learned meant water. 

He went to work with con- 
tainers and wires and elec- 
trodes, following a procedure 
roughly outlined in the books. 
After several mistakes and 
one mild electric shock he had 
the apparatus working. The 
seal over the latch melted 
away like ice in July sun- 
shine. Kelsey wondered idly 
what the seal was made from ; 
but he didn’t much care, as 
long as he got rid of it. 

He had been briefly wor- 
ried by the realization that 
the other gas produced, called 
oxygen, was escaping into the 
air of the room. He thought 
the name was familiar, but 
he wasn’t sure until a book 
assured him he had been 
breathing the stuff all his life. 

Stepping into the next 
room, and facing door num- 
ber 4, Kelsey felt almost at 
home. Before he could do any- 
thing else a great sleepiness 
rose up in him and overcame 
him. He stretched out on the 
floor, worried drowsily for a 
moment about the chance of 
another flood as he slept, and 
sank into oblivion. 

If he dreamed, he did not 
remember it when he awoke. 

sat up alertly, feeling 
good, remembering in- 
instantly all that had hap- 
pened. 

There was another shelf in 
FRED SABERHAGEN 





this room, it was as big as 
the last, and he supposed the 
books and odd-looking junk 
on it would enable him to 
open Door 4. But he paused 
after getting to his feet and 
stretching, to consider first 
another puzzle. 

He felt refreshed and alert, 
as if he had just slept eight 
hours. He had spent an unde- 
terminable time getting 
through the other rooms, and 
lying unconscious in them. 

However long he had been 
in this place, he had had noth- 
ing to eat or drink since ar- 
riving. He didn’t want any- 
thing now. And another 
thing; there had been noth- 
ing like plumbing in any of 
the rooms, unless you counted 
the flooding pipe in the first. 
It seemed that he didn’t need 
any plumbing. 

He felt physically fine in 
every way. He didn’t even 
want a cigarette. 

He had shaved in the morn- 
ing (this morning? yester- 
day?) before going to work. 
He rubbed his face; it was 
still smooth. 

His comfort was eerie, 
evoking forgotten ghost stor- 
ies about people who had died 
without knowing it. Had he 
really drowned while swim- 
ming in the lake? 

He breathed. His pulse 
beat. He kicked a toe rather 
incautiously against a wall 
and was painfully convinced 
of solidity. Were his bodily 
needs being taken care of 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



while he slept? That was hard 
to believe ; he thought any ex- 
planation for all this would 
be hard to believe. Yet one 
must be true. 

Kelsey walked back 
through the rooms he had al- 
ready traversed. Water now 
filled the second room to the 
lower edge of the open hatch 
in the wall. He would have to 
wade and dive if he wanted 
another look at the first room, 
but he saw no point in doing 
so. On impulse he scooped up 
water in his hand. It tasted 
all right. 

But he wasn’t thirsty. 

Whoever was behind this, 
for whatever unimaginable 
purpose, seemed to be urging 
him forward with the threat 
of flood. There was no way 
out back here. Whether there 
would be any way out for him 
ahead — he told himself there 
must be. 

Kelsey faced the locked 
door numbered 4. It had a 
keyhole, and engraved beside 
it was the word: ETRUS- 
CAN. 

Kelsey looked at the now 
familiar rack of keys, and 
again felt the impulse to try 
one at random, to rush 
through doors — he didn’t 
doubt there would be more of 
them — as quickly as possible, 
to get to the bottom of the 
whole situation. But at door 
7, a random try had given un- 
pleasant results. He would 
keep on solving problems as 
long as he could, and then 

63 




guess the rest if he had to. 

Now let’s see about ETRUS- 
CAN, he thought, whatever 
it means. Each key was num- 
bered to correspond to one of 
the bits of junk on this room’s 
shelf. The bits of junk were 
pottery, clay or stone, paint- 
ed or carved in decoration, 
some whole, some only bro- 
ken pieces. 

There were what looked 
like textbooks on the shelf 
again, with covers and a lot 
of pages missing, as before. 
This time there were also 
thick notebooks. Kelsey 
picked up one of these and 
found it crammed with neat 
notes and drawings that were 
plain enough in detail — but 
what was it all about? 

Grimly, he began to study 
the mass of archeological 
field notes, determined to find 
out which one of the bits of 
junk was an ETRUSCAN. He 
read for what seemed a long 
time, standing there. He did 
not grow tired of standing, 
didn’t even lean on the shelf. 
He noticed this but put it out 
of his mind. 

It took a long time. But 
when the sleepiness came 
again, and he lay down on the 
floor, it was in front of a door 
numbered 3. 

put aside speculation 
about how much time 
was passing, or what it was 
all about. “All right, I’ll play 
your crazy game,” he mut- 
tered aloud. He would just ac- 

64 



cept the absence of any phys- 
ical need as a blessing,, and 
keep working his way 
through doors. 

He solved a problem in po- 
sitional astronomy, learning 
to use mathematics that he 
had never dreamed existed. 
Following an instruction book 
quite unlike any he had ever 
seen, he programmed a com- 
puter that he only vaguely un- 
derstood, and did not need to 
understand. The read-out was 
a tiny orrery, including a ship 
that Kelsey had to navigate 
from planet to planet. Not, to 
be sure, with the complica- 
tion of changing mass-ratios. 

The solar system represent- 
ed in the model had only six 
planets, none of them with a 
sizable moon, which facts sug- 
gested nothing to Kelsey. He 
was satisfied when the sched- 
uled journey was complete, 
and door 3 clicked open for 
him. 

The test required to open 
door 2 first appeared some- 
what easier. The first half of 
a musical composition was 
played repeatedly to Kelsey, 
through some invisible speak- 
er. Pressing one of a series of 
numbered buttons brought 
him the sound of one of four 
last-halfs, all quite similar. 
There were books on musical 
theory, and printed copies of 
each ending. He listened and 
studied until he felt sick of all 
music. Finally he made a 
choice. 

He was mistaken. 



FRED SABERHAGEN 




The door refused the key. 
No shock bit at his hand, no 
sound of rushing water came 
from the rooms behind him. 
All was quiet, the eternal qui- 
et of this place that might be 
expected to get on a guv’s 
nerves, but so far hadn’t both- 
ered him. 

Evidently his mistake was 
not to be punished. Kelsey 
was suddenly angry. That 
someone could push him 
around like this, use him for 
a ... a ... guinea 
pig. The term floated into his 
mind; he wondered what it 
was, exactly, that scientists 
really did with guinea pigs. 
When he got out of here he 
would look it up. 

If he got out of here. 

When! Now to get this 
damned door open. The temp- 
tation to choose one of the 
three remaining keys at ran- 
dom was strong; but no, he 
would try what he honestly 
thought to be the second most 
likely piece of music. 

This time the key worked. 
Kelsey stepped through and 
waited for the sleepiness to 
come. 

D OOR 1. He had anticipat- 
ed it, in the back of his 
mind, for what now seemed 
many days. Would there be a 
final answer behind it? Or a 
door numbered O ? Or a trick ? 
He had thought perhaps door 
1 would be the most difficult of 
all to open. He went to work 
as soon as he woke up. 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



Kelsey built a cathedral. At 
least the structure somewhat 
resembled a Gothic church 
when he was through with it. 
He built it about three feet 
high, from blocks about a cu- 
bic inch in volume, that clung 
together like mortared ma- 
sonry when he fitted one to 
another. He built it using tiny 
waldo arms, which were an- 
other concept utterly new to 
him. They worked into a 
glasslike enclosure that pre- 
vented him from reaching di- 
rectly the simple latch of door 
1. In this room the latch was 
not on the door but on the 
wall a few feet away. A block 
in the mechanism kept him 
from quite reaching the latch 
directly with the arms. 

He had a helper, for the 
first time. When he pressed a 
button, a small machine ran 
from one corner of the en- 
closure as if anxious to assist 
him, climbed upon the blocks 
until it reached the highest 
point of whatever pile or 
structure they formed, and 
reached a tiny arm as far as 
it could toward the latch. 

Kelsey had to build some- 
thing with the blocks for the 
robot to climb on, so it could 
reach the latch. He soon 
learned that it could not climb 
a tall narrow spire of blocks; 
he didn’t have enough ma- 
terial to build a massive ramp 
or stairway. Besides the 
blocks, he had beams to work 
with, sticks of varied sizes 
and shapes, up to a few inch- 

65 








66 



FRED SABERHAGEN 



es long. Each beam had the 
word TEMPORARY lettered 
on it. Kelsey soon found what 
TEMPORARY meant in this 
case; if the little robot at- 
tempted to climb the struc- 
ture while any of the beams 
were in place, the blocks im- 
mediately lost their cohesive- 
ness and his whole work col- 
lapsed. 

A good many of his efforts 
collapsed from one cause or 
another, usually while the ro- 
bot was climbing. The little 
machine hit the floor hard, 
but always bounced up and 
returned to its corner, like an 
undaunted boxer ready for 
the next round. Kelsey chuck- 
led at the robot, tried to think 
of a name for it, and vowed 
he would have no less pa- 
tience. 

He built and rebuilt, with- 
out tiring. There were books 
on engineering, architecture, 
and construction; he studied 
them between attempts. What 
he needed was a tall struc- 
ture, with a fairly large top 
for the robot to stand on while 
it reached for the latch. Since 
the amount of blocks was lim- 
ited, the structure would have 
to be hollow inside. He used 
his little beams for temporary 
support, and discovered the 
beauty of the arch, and the 
use of the flying buttress to 
keep arch-supporting walls 
from collapsing outward. 

There came a time when the 
robot climbed successfully 
and stretched itself upward, 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



until the tip of one small met- 
al arm reached the latch, 
curved over, and pulled pre- 
cisely . 

Click! 

He had done it. Seven 
doors. 

K ELSEY felt excitement 
such that his hands 
should have trembled with it, 
but they remained steady and 
obedient as machines. 

Door 1 swung ajar for him 
now. He felt an impulse to 
take the robot with him, but 
it was still out of his reach 
behind the glass. And it now 
hung inanimate from the 
latch it had opened. It was 
only a machine. 

Almost without pause Kel- 
sey pushed open door 1 and 
stepped through. An unum- 
bered door faced him from 
the familiar place in the op- 
posite wall, but something 
else grabbed his attention im- 
mediately — a ladder rose 

through a hole in the glowing 
ceiling, and down through the 
hole came a greenish wavery 
light that might be a water- 
mottled reflection of the sun. 

Kelsey climbed quickly. 
Above the room the ladder 
curved off to become a sort of 
stairway, inside a tube big 
enough to hold a crawling 
man. Climbing around a 
sharp bend in the tube, Kel- 
sey felt an odd sensation, as 
if he had been turned upside 
down for a moment, lost his 
balance and his visual per- 

67 




spective. The feeling passed 
in an instant; he climbed on, 
into brighter light. 

Some force held clear wa- 
ter up like a lid inside the up- 
per end of the tube ; it looked 
as if the upper end was just 
under the normal surface of 
a body of water, with bright 
light above, as if from a clear 
sunny sky. 

Kelsey was quite practical 
about wonders by now. He 
poked a finger into the water- 
lid above his head, and with- 
drew it wet but undamaged. 
He crawled up through the 
water, and stopped with head 
and shoulders in the open air 
and sun, his weight still sup- 
ported by the' tube. 

He had emerged into the 
familiarity of the Chicago 
shoreline, to very nearly the 
exact spot where he had felt 
the grasp and sting at his 
ankle, a few yards offshore 
from the rocks. The sun was 
nearly overhead on a bright 
warm day. Piled as he had 
left it he saw his clothing. 
Above the gentle lapping of 
wave against rock he heard 
his transistor portable blar- 
ing something with a beat. 

The same day! 

Mechanically he pushed 
himself free of the tube and 
dog-paddled to the rocks. A 
couple of people were in sight, 
strolling or sunbathing. The 
same people. He remembered 
them now. It was the same 
hour. Maybe the same min- 
ute. 



His mind felt blank. He 
pulled himself up onto the 
rock and sat staring stupidly. 
The grab at his ankle, the 
strange place, the old man, 
the flood, the tests and the 
doors, one after another, all 
had no ties to his reality right 
now. He felt that in a little 
while he would convince him- 
self that the whole thing had 
been a dream — but never 
quite convince himself entire- 
ly. To the end of his life he 
would carry the doubt, and 
the wonder . 

Kelsey entered the water 
again. He swam out and 
groped down with his feet. 
The tube entrance was still 
where he had left it. Was it 
always here? Ridiculous. 
Swimmers and boaters and 
fishermen would run into it 
all the time. He ducked under 
water and opened his eyes 
and tried to see the — place 
down there, from the outside, 
but there was nothing visible 
except the mouth of the tube, 
and a few yards of the tube 
itself in the green murkiness. 
He gripped the lip of the tube 
opening, a few feet underwa- 
ter, and stared downward in- 
side. He could see quite a way. 

He came up for air. The 
thing, the system, whatever it 
was, whoever controlled it, 
had released him, hadn’t it? 
He had studied and struggled 
his way out. What more did 
he want? Revenge? Maybe. 
He wanted something. He 
somehow believed that if he

reported this to someone it 
would all be gone when they 
came to look for it. 

He remembered the final, 
numberless, unnecessary door 
he had seen down there. He 
looked around with longing at 
his familiar world, drew a 
deep breath, and went under 
water. 

G OING down, Kelsey got 
the same queer sensation 
at the bend in the tube— as if 
he was being pulled in a hurry 
from one place to another. He 
ignored it and went on. 

The room at the foot of the 
ladder was just as he remem- 
bered it. He faced one way 
and sighted through a line of 
open doors, through which he 
had worked his way to free- 
dom. He faced the other way, 
toward the final door, unnum- 
bered and unlatched. 

Kelsey stood quietly for a 
moment with his hand on the 
door ; then pushed gently. The 
door swung open. Nothing 
else happened. Light was dim 
on the other side. He stepped 
through and found himself 
facing a thick-looking trans- 
lucent wall. He could dimly 
discern an unfamiliar shape 
moving in the vagueness be- 
yond it. 

“And so the' final test is 
passed,” said a man’s voice 
from a speaker over Kelsey’s 
head, making him jump. “The 
will to open the unnecessary 
door is yours.” 

Kelsey backed warily away, 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



and stood holding the door 
open. 

“All right — what’s it all 
about?” he demanded. “Who 
are you?” 

“I am an alien here. My 
shape is not yours. To see me 
now might disturb you.” 

It was quiet except for Kel- 
sey’s breathing. He found he 
believed what he had just 
been told. Outer space. Jokes 
about little green men. Not 
funny now. 

“What do you want?” he 
finally asked. “Why did you 
put me through all that?” 

“I want to go home,” said 
the voice simply and eagerly. 
“I can do things that seem to 
you very wonderful, but one 
thing I cannot do without the 
willing help of another intelli- 
gent mind. That is to drive 
my ship through the great dis- 
tances, to make timelike the 
great intervals, to get home — 
neither to die of age myself 
on the way, or to find my 
world old and my people gone 
when I arrive . can you 
understand? I must pass 
many stars to get home.” 
“You want help, why don’t 
you just ask?” 

"VOUR societies must be 
1 left to themselves now, 
for a long time to come, not 
bothered from outside. This is 
very important. I must deal 
only with an individual. 

“You have the ability to 
help me, proven by my tests. 
I have violated your rights 

69 




and subjected you to strange 
pressures, but I assure you 
you were never in real danger 
here. I ask your forgiveness; 
my need for help is great.” 

Something suggested to 
Kelsey that he turn around 
and scramble up the ladder as 
fast as he could. Somehow he 
didn’t. “How come you need 
help?” 

“There has been an acci- 
dent — I am the only one of 
my kind left alive in this ship. 
I will explain it in detail if 
you wish.” 

“What happened to that old 
man?” Kelsey demanded sud- 
denly. 

“I created his apparent 
body from a material sensi- 
tive to mental forces, using 
specifications in your own 
mind. He appeared to you as 
a being you knew to be intel- 
ligent, yet one far from what 
you think of as your own kind. 
Still you took what you be- 
lieved to be a grave risk in 
order to protect his life. If 
you elect to go with me, you 
will gain knowledge that is 
not well entrusted to one who 
holds the lives of other beings 
in contempt. The old man 
was your first test. He never 
existed as a person.” 

“You expect me to believe 
that — ” 

“Watch.” 

An opening dilated in a 
wall. An amorphous gray 
lump of stuff flowed out like a 
huge fat worm onto the floor. 
It rose, coloring and shaping 

70 



itself into rags and chains 
and a smiling Oriental face. 
It nodded at Kelsey cheerful- 
ly; the rags and chains be- 
came the rich robe of a man- 
darin. 

“I can speak through the 
mouth of this image, if you 
wish,” the figure said. 

“Better than TV,” said Kel- 
sey, sounding idiotic to him- 
self. “Listen, how do you ex- 
pect me to help you?” 

“You can, if you are will- 
ing. Your mind is good, do not 
be afraid to let it reach out 
for things. The work on the 
trip will not be hard. There 
will be much time for fun, 
and I can promise you will not 
be bored. In four years you 
can be back on Earth, if you 
wish, though there is a plan- 
et in my home system with 
people very much like yours 
which ...” 

“Four years!” But what’s 
the difference, Kelsey 
thought, I’m not going any- 
way. 

“I regret so long a time. 
But I and my people will not 
be ungrateful; there will be 
compensations . .” 

“Wait a minute.” Kelsey 
backed toward the ladder, the 
mandarin following him with 
cheerful eyes. “If you’re from 
— where you say — how come 
you know so much about us 
here on Earth ? Don’t tell me 
you got it all out of my mind, 
all those tests. I didn’t know 
all that stuff to begin with.” 

The mandarin melted down 



FRED SABERHAGEN 




to a gray puddle and began to 
flow away. “You are not the 
first being I have seized, test- 
ed, and interviewed on this 
planet,” said the voice from 
the speaker. “More than nine 
hundred others preceded 
you. By now I know you peo- 
ple well enough to test you for 
ability to give the help I need. 
You are not the first to be 
suitable. But I hope you will 
be the first to accept. I 
have been hopping this ship 
from one large body of water 
to another for several of your 
years, keeping it hidden from 
the mass of your people, 
whom I do not wish to dis- 
turb, trying to find one who 
can and will help me.” 

K ELSEY put a hand on the 
ladder. Why hadn’t he 
just stayed on shore once he 
got away? But now he had to 
keep asking questions. “What 
happens to the people who 
don’t pass your tests? Or who 
don’t want to go with you?” 
There was a little silence. 
Then the voice from the 
speaker said: “I am sorry. I 
forget now in my eagerness 
that you do not know us, and 
in the light of your experience 
you are right to be suspicious. 

“I do not mistreat them 
further. They are set free — 
as you are now — to return to 
their normal lives at very 
nearly the point where I in- 
terrupted them. I try to im- 
prove their health as some 
payment for my violation of 

SEVEN DOORS TO EDUCATION 



their constitutional rights.” 
“You mean, if I had just 
walked away up there — ?” 
“I would have bothered you 
no more. In a very few min- 
utes you would have forgot- 
ten the entire incident.” 
“Thanks,” said Kelsey. He 
turned and went two steps up 
the ladder quickly, then 
turned again. “How did you 
give me all those tests in a 
few minutes?” 

“If you come with me, you 
can learn that — and many 
other things.” 

“I see,” Kelsey muttered. 
Four years out of a guy’s life 
. but what am I thinking 
of ? I better get out of here be- 
fore he changes his mind, and 
locks me in. 

He went up the ladder 
quickly. Tomorrow would be 
Tuesday. He would go to the 
post office, and sort mail. He 
would do more than that, 
damn it. He would go to some 
of the colleges and see what 
kind of evening classes they 
had going. 

But hadn’t the alien said he 
would forget all about this 
ship a few minutes after he 
left it? Maybe he would simp- 
ly slide back into his old life, 
and never know the differ- 
ence. Well, he asked himself 
angrily, would that be so bad? 
Besides, a lot of people would 
miss me if I just took off for 
four years. 

Who, really? 

He believed the alien, some- 
how. If the guy had been ly- 

71 




ing he would have named a 
shorter time than four years. 

Kelsey reached the top of 
the tube, and paused with 
head and shoulders out of wa- 
ter. Miles to the southwest, 
out of his sight now behind 
rocks and park and distant 
skyscrapers, was the Main 
Post Office, where he might 
retire in about twenty years. 
It was really a big place when 
you were standing near it, or 
inside it sorting mail. From 
here it was nothing, a small 
hidden box, blind and self- 
contained under the reach of 
all the sky. 

"T’M ready. Can we move the 
1 ship now? Just by think- 
ing about it?” 



“Yes, we can, as we are 
working with the machines. 
Relax. Now hold this pattern 
in your mind.” A thing inde- 
scribable in Earthman’s 
words came to Kelsey’s con- 
sciousness. “Think about it 
until I come back with anoth- 
er.” 

“Got it.” 

At about midnight, each of 
the higher-frequency radars 
working in North America 
cast on its scope a burst of 
noise. An alert was called, but 
nothing further out of the or- 
dinary was observed. 

And no one on Earth at- 
tributed the event to the mak- 
ing timelike of a great inter- 
val.

WHAT COMES TRUE

to call me the English Jules Verne. As a matter of fact there is no 
literary resemblance whatever between the anticipatory inventions of the 
great Frenchmen and (my) fantasies. His work dealt always with actual 
possibilities of invention and discovery and he made some remarkable 
forecasts. The interest he invoked was a practical one; he wrote and 
believed and told that this thing or that thing could be done, which was 
not at that time done. He helped his reader to imagine it done and to 
imagine what fun, excitement or mischief would ensue. Many of his 
inventions have ‘come true.’ But these stories of mine ... do no pretend 
to deal with possible things; they are exercises of the imagination in a 
quite different field. — H. G. Wells

THE USELESS 

BUGBREEDERS - BY JAMES STAMERS 



T HE previous case was a 
Weeper, and he lost. So 
the Space Zoning Commis- 
sioners were damp and irri- 
table before I opened plead- 
ings for my client. I tried not 
to squelch as I approached 
the bench. 

“Not the Flammables again, 
Mr. Jones?” the fat Commis- 
sioner asked nastily, spong- 
ing his suit with a sodden 
handkerchief. 

“This was last week, Your 
Honor.” 

The thin dark Commission- 
er stared pointedly at the 
charred end of the bench near- 
est the witness seat. 

“Indeed it was, Mr. Jones.” 



TO THE SPACE COUNCIL, 
ASTEROID 4722 WAS JUST 
ANOTHER ROADBLOCK IN 
THE WAY OF INTERPLAN- 
ETARY TRAFFIC. BUT TO 
THE USELESS BUGBREED- 
ERS IT WAS HOME! 



The middle Commissioner 
poised his fingers and looked 
at the court ceiling; moisture 
gleamed diamond like on his 
bald head. 

“Now let me see,” he in- 
toned. “Correct me if I err, 
Mr. Jones, but I seem to ob- 
serve you have a habit of rep- 
resenting somewhat spectacu- 
lar aliens. Including, in the 
past six months alone, the 
Drillers, Whirling Tombs, 
Fragile Glasses, Erupters, Vi- 
brational Men, Transparent 
Women — and of course let 
us not forget the Flamma- 
bles.” 

“I assure Your Honor, my 
present clients will be found 



74 




to be sober, hardworking, de- 
sirable members of the Galac- 
tic Community, seeking only 
to live on their own asteroid 
in peace under a democratic 
system, which . 

“Thank you, Mr. Jones. 
Shall we proceed?” 

“And perhaps,” added the 
fat Commissioner, “you may 
be good enough to leave us 
with most of our courtroom 
intact on this occasion.” 

The thin Commissioner 
sighed and shuffled his papers. 

“You appear, Mr. Jones, to 
contest a Space Council rul- 
ing for the elimination of 
Asteroid Four Thousand Sev- 
en Hundred and Twenty-Two 
on the grounds, which you al- 
lege, mat it is a peaceful 
dwelling of an adult aud re- 
sponsible alien race.” 

“Yes, Your Honor.” 

“Then let us see your adult, 
um, Bugbreeder.” 

I shuffled uncomfortably and 
splashed the court stenogra- 
pher who gave me a dirty 
look. 

“A space tramp's name giv- 
en in the early days of Space, 
Your Honor. More properly, 
my clients are the Selective 
Culturists of Bacteria and 
Lesser Life." 

The fat Commissioner sniff- 
ed. 

“Bugbreeders will do," he 
said. “Produce one." 

My client hopped off the 
table and ran nimbly up to 
the witness seat. He sat there 
like a small green snowball 

THE USELESS BUGBREEDERS 



with large and pointed ears. 

“Happy, happy to be here. 
I’m sure,” he said. 

Fortunately he had a hand 
to raise and looked reasonably 
humanoid as he was sworn in. 
The caterpillar and semi-jelly 
cultures make a less favorable 
first impression, and at this 
point the Driller had gone ex- 
citedly through the floor. 

“You are a representative 
member of your race?” I ask- 
ed formally. 

“Oh, yus. Much." 

"And you reside on Asteroid 
Four Thousand Seven Hund- 
red and Twenty-Two, the 
permanent dwelling of your 
race?” 

“Oh, yus. Home." 

“And although your home 
presents certain technical diffi- 
culties for interplanetary veh- 
icles on the spacerun to the 
greater planets, you maintain 
it should be preserved because 
of your contribution to the cul- 
ture of the Galactic Commun- 
ity?” I asked. 

“Oh, yus.” 

“Does he understand a word 
you’re saying, Mr. Jones?” 
asked the bald Commissioner. 

“Oh, yus. Not much,” said 
my client cheerfully. 

“Hurrmph," I said, and 
coughed. 

“Perhaps I may assist," 
suggested the thin Commis- 
sioner, with a nasty look at 
me. “What exactly does your 
race do?" 

“Breed bugs, I’m sure. Am 
head bacteriophysicist name 

75 




of Lood. Am good ■ scientist.” 

“And what exactly do you 
do with these bugs you raise?” 

“Most everything.” 

WV^OUR Honors,” I inter- 

1 rupted. “At this point I 
propose a few simple demon- 
strations of what Mr. Lood 
and his people can do.” 

“May I inquire if either of 
my learned brethren know any 
way in which we can charge 
Mr. Jones with rebuilding 
costs, if necessary?” asked the 
bald Commissioner. 

“Your Honors, I assure 
you . .” 

“Proceed at your peril, Mr. 
Jones.” 

I walked over to the exhibit 
table and pointed to a row of 
jars. 

“Exhibits A through G, 
Your Honors. Samples of food 
and beverages produced by my 
clients without raw materials 
and from the expert culture 
of bacteria.” 

I held up a jar full of mauve 
fungus. It was the most at- 
tractive example. 

“I would hardly call feeding 
on funguses a sign of a re- 
sponsible humanoid race, Mr. 
Jones.” 

“Perhaps Your Honor will 
recall the part played by bac- 
teria in making milk, cheese, 
wine, beer, bread.” 

The Commmissioners looked 
at each other and nodded re- 
luctantly. So I passed the jars 
up to them, secure in the 
knowledge they had been test- 

76 



ed by the Alien Foods Bureau. 
I watched the Commissioners 
unscrew the lids and taste the 
contents somewhat hesitantly. 

“Not bad,” confessed the fat 
Commissioner eventually. 

“Quite palatable.” 

“Of course we already have 
honey and similar foodstuffs, 
Mr. Jones.” 

“Naturally, Your Honor. 
But Mr. Lood’s race can sur- 
vive without extraplanetary 
aid. Provided they have sun- 
shine and water, they can 
breed their spores and bacte- 
ria with no other resources.” 

“You mean,” said the thin 
Commissioner with a dark 
leer, “that almost any sunny 
planet would do for them?” 

Somewhere along the line 
my point seemed to have been 
swept away, so I added hur- 
riedly : 

“I offer this evidence pure- 
ly to show the high degree of 
civilization of my clients’ cul- 
ture, as cause why they should 
not be deprived of their native 
land.” 

“Oh, yus,” my client agreed. 

“Mr. Lood,” intoned the 
bald Commissioner, “to stay 
on your present asteroid you 
will have to prove that your 
race offers something that 
cannot be found elsewhere in 
the Galactic Community. Now 
have these funguses of yours 
any special medicinal values, 
for example?” 

“Please?” 

“Can you cure diseases with 
them?” 



JAMES STAMERS 




"Oh, no.” 

“Ah,” said the thin and 
fat Commissioners together. 
"Proceed, Mr. Jones.” 

T HAT put Lood somewhere 
back behind the twentieth- 
century discoverers of peni- 
cillin and the myecins, and 
even back behind the pioneer 
Pasteur. Five hundred years 
back, in fact. 

"Yes. Well. Let’s see how 
my clients handle housing, 
Your Honors. I think you’ll 
find this quite revolutionary. 
Mr. Lood?” 

Lood hopped off the witness 
seat and trotted up to the long 
table normally reserved for at- 
torneys. Lately, I have found 
my professional colleagues 
strangely reluctant to stay in 
court when I have a case, so 
Lood had the entire table to 
himself. 

He pulled a small jar out 
from under the table and 
spread a pile of dust on the 
tabletop. Then he unscrewed 
the jar and gently poured 
nothing out of it onto the 
dust. Nothing visible, that is. 
But I assumed it was teeming 
with viruses and such. 

“While Mr. Lood gets this 
started, Your Honors,” I said, 
hoping the viruses or what- 
ever were not fatal to humans, 
“may I submit the usefulness 
of fungus foods for space- 
travel and for pioneers on in- 
hospitable planets?” 

"Are we having difficulties 
with General Food - Concen- 

ThE USELESS BUGBREEDERS 



trates, the Travelers Capsule 
Combine and the other ten 
thousand concerns in this line, 
Mr. Jones?” the bald Commis- 
sioner asked quietly. 

You can’t say I didn’t try. 
I shut up and watched Lood 
fuss with the dust on the 
table. 

It started moving as if it 
were bubbling and Lood stood 
back. 

Slowly, the dust on the table 
formed itself into a brick, a 
long eight by six by three inch 
brick. Lood smiled happily. 

“And here, Your Honors,” 
I said triumphantly, “here is 
automatic housing.” 

“One brick does not make a 
house, Mr. Jones.” 

“If Your Honors will just 
watch ...” 

The brick slowly elongated 
and split into two perfect 
bricks, lying on the table end 
to end. 

“Mass colony action of bac- 
teria, said Lood wisely. “Oh, 
yus.” 

The two bricks each split 
into two further bricks. These 
divided and multiplied them- 
selves while we watched, out 
to the end of the table. 

“I would like Your Honors 
to observe the way these 
bricks overcome natural haz- 
ards,” I said, getting into my 
stride. 

I pointed to the bricks droop- 
ing over the end of the table. 
A brick fell onto the floor at 
each end, then built itself up 
until it joined the line of 

77 




bricks on the table, forming 
a perfect arch at each angle. 
The line on the table was now 
three bricks high, so I walk- 
ed round and stood behind the 
wall. 

“You see, Your Honors, 
suppose I need a house. I 
merely combine these suitable 
microbes and dust. And there 
we are, a house.” 

I had to stand on tiptoe to 
finish the sentence because of 
the mathematics involved. Ev- 
ery brick was doubling and 
redoubling itself in just under 
a minute. And the wall was 
getting quite impressively 
high. 

“Mr. Jones,” called one of 
the Commissioners. 

It was not until I tried to 
walk round the end of the wall 
that I found I had been out- 
flanked. 

I ran to the nearest wall of 
the courtroom but the bricks 
got there first. I heard a rend- 
ing noise that suggested the 
other end had gone clean 
through the opposite wall. As 
a matter of fact, I saw the 
astonished face of an attorney 
entering the main door of the 
Justice Building as the wall 
advanced towards him. Then 
he saw me. He grinned and 
waved. 

I was in no mood to wave 
bcick 

“Mr. Lood, Mr. Lood,” I 
yelled. “Can you hear me?” 

“Wall too thick, yus,” came 
a muffled answer. 

And indeed it was. I had not 

78 



noticed it, but the wall was 
expanding sideways as well. 

I was calculating the approxi- 
mate thickness when it went 
up and through the roof of the 
courtroom. 

Fortunately it was a nice 
sunny day. 

H owever, this was no 
time to sunbathe and I 
dashed towards the hole in the 
courtroom wall, where Lood’s 
wall had gone through. 

I just got out before a butt- 
ress, coming out the wall at 
right angles, blocked the gap. 
I remembered something Lood 
had said about the automatic 
creation of full-scale houses 
on a simple standard plan: 
two rooms, a toilet and a 
patio. 

Outside, the wall was well 
on the way towards complet- 
ing its second simple house. 
This side of the wall was, that 
is. I could only assume it was 
doing something similar on 
the other side. There was no 
way of getting round and see- 
ing, except by outstripping 
the wall in a sprint. 

I gathered my breath and 
dignity and ran very rapidly 
down the length of the wall, 
round the far mounting tiers 
of brick, advancing now on the 
State Library, and back to 
where I had left the Commis- 
sioners and Mr. Lood. 

I was faced by a thicket of 
patios and arched doorways 
and low-roofed houses. 

“Your Honors, Your Hon- 

JAMES STAMERS 




ors,” I called hopefully, walk- 
ing into the maze, in the gen- 
eral direction of what appear- 
ed to be an old and ruined 
war monument. It then oc- 
curred to me that this was 
the outer wall of the court- 
house. It stood far off, point- 
ing a stone finger to the sky, 
as if going down in a sea of 
brick for the third time. 

“Your Honors, Your Hon- 
ors . 

I met them turning a cor- 
ner. 

Unfortunately, they seemed 
to have found it necessary to 
crawl through a broken gap 
of some sort. They were very 
dusty and had a slightly 
shredded appearance. 

“Ah, Mr. Jones,” they said 
grimly, dusting each other off. 

A tremendous crash an- 
nounced the falling in of the 
roof of the State Library. 

“Well,” said the thin Com- 
missioner, “he did say it was 
revolutionary.” 

I smiled politely. 

“Don’t giggle, Mr. Jones, or 
we’ll hold you in contempt.” 

We wound out of the maze 
in single file. A pattering be- 
hind us announced Lood bring- 
ing up the rear. 

Once we were out, and a- 
bout two hundred yards ahead 
of the advancing walls, patios 
and houses, the three Com- 
missioners turned on me. 

“Mr. Jones,” they said with 
restraint. “You will now stop 
this reckless building proj- 
ect.” 



I turned to Lood. 

“You must stop it,” I said. 

“Oh, yus,” he agreed, nod- 
ding happily. “Most marvel- 
ous, no. Ample housing for all 
and sundry. Homes for peo- 
ples. Immediate occupancy. 
You like basic plan house, 
yus?” 

“Mr. Lood,” snarled the fat 
Commissioner. “The problem

far has been to find room to

Distant crashing informed 
me that an unprecedented 
houseclearing was still going 
on. 

“. And so are all author- 
ized planets yet discovered. 
I speak for my learned breth- 
ren in saying that this . 
this anthill of yours is one 
thing the Galactic Community 
can do without.” 

“And do without right now,” 
added his bald colleague. 

“You wish to stop?” asked 
Lood. 

Small tears filled the peri- 
phery of his round eyes. 

“Yes,” I confirmed brutally. 
“Can you stop it?” 

“Oh, yus. Must have anti- 
septics.” 

I T took the fire department 
four hours of spraying from 
their copters to reduce the 
entire housing estate to dust. 
And then an even blanket of 
brown feathery residue lay 
unbroken for several acres, 
save here and there where the 
shells of previous buildings

Stood up gauntly and accus- 
ingly. 

“All bugs gone,” said Lood 
sadly. 

“But what about this mess?” 
demanded the bald Commis- 
sioner. 

“Comes out of air. Floating 
particles. Process cleans air, 
too.” 

A fresh wind from across 
the blanket of dust came in- 
opportunely to punctuate Mr. 
Lood’s remark. As soon as 
they could talk again, the 
Commissioners suggested re- 
suming in another city. 

“Assuming, Mr. Jones, you 
wish to produce further as- 
pects of your, hum, case.” 

Six red and bleary eyes 
stared at me from a coating 
of brown dust of only vaguely 
judicial appearance. 

“I think, Your Honors, the 
next evidence had better be 
delivered in the open,” I said, 
and pointed to a nearby park. 

Much, if not all, of the dust 
fell off us as we walked over 
to the small green hill in the 
center of the park. The birds 
twittered, the sun shone, the 
breeze was fresh; and after 
the Commissioners had set- 
tled on convenient tree stumps, 
I felt quite hopeful about the 
third line of evidence. Lood 
stood optimistically by. 

“Your Honors,” I said, 
“you are aware that Earth 
suffers a grave shortage of 
metals. Almost all economical 
quantities have been mined 
out. Yet, Your Honors — ” I 



paused dramatically — “in the 
haematin of human blood 
alone, whose main function is 
to carry oxygen to the system, 
there is nearly twice as much 
iron by weight as oxygen.” 

“Precisely which of us, Mr. 
Jones, do you propose to mine 
first?” 

I cleared my throat and let 
the thin Commissioner’s re- 
mark pass. 

“Merely making the point, 
Your Honor, that the metal- 
carrying properties of bacteria 
have been hardly considered.” 

This was stretching it a bit 
because selective breeding of 
microbes for the recovery of 
metals in tailings have been 
developed back in the nine- 
teen-fifties. But so far as I 
knew, no one had carried it as 
far as my client race. 

“Mr. Lood,” I commanded. 

“Just one moment, Mr. 
Jones,” said the bald Commis- 
sioner drily. “Let us have an 
outline of this before we 
start.” 

“Certainly, Your Honor. 
Mr. Lood will now extract 
gold from a sample of ocean 
water we have obtained.” 

I signalled to the waiting 
carrier and it came trundling 
softly over the grass and de- 
posited a large tank on the 
grass. 

“Genuine untouched ocean 
water, Your Honors,” I said, 
slapping the tank. “Go ahead, 
Mr. Lood.” 

The little fellow hopped up 
to the side of the tank and 



80 



JAMES STAMERS 




emptied another invisible 
horde from a test tube into 
the water. 

We waited. 

“Oh, yus,” he said. 

And there on the bottom of 
the tank was an unmistakable 
sludge of metallic gold, shin- 
ing speckled in the rays of 
sunlight bending through the 
water. 

I scooped out a sample and 
handed it round for the Com- 
missioners to inspect. 

“Subject to analysis,” grunt- 
ed the fat one, “this certainly 
seems to be gold.” 

“Of course, there is no rea- 
son why this should not be 
done on Earth, as a starting 
point” 

The thin Commissioner 
paused and looked at my 
client. 

“Does this process affect 
fish?” 

“Oh, yus,” said Lood. “Kills 
all parasites. Fish, reptiles, 
and such.” 

“Thank you,” said the Com- 
missioner drily. 

M R. Lood looked at me apol- 
ogetically. 

“My people too small to 
tolerate fish,” he explained. 
“Fish most dangerous wild 
beasts. Oh, yus.” 

“Never mind,” I reassured 
him. “Your Honors, I feel 
the court will take a more fa- 
vorable view of the dry-land 
operation, then. Taking place 
as it does in the bowels of the 
earth, there is no danger to

valuable livestock. And here 
we can demonstrate, for ex- 
ample,- simple aluminum ex- 
traction, by the progressive 
reduction and oxidation and 
reduction of bacteria on a mo- 
lecular scale. 

“I hope,” I added, “this ex- 
periment will produce visible 
evidence of this great boon to 
mankind, though I must ask 
Your Honors to watch close- 
ly.” 

Lood produced another test- 
tube, pressed a small hole in 
the grass with his finger and 
emptied the tube. The hole 
darkened. 

We all bent over to watch. 

Nothing happened. 

“Perhaps a dud batch?” I 
asked eventually. 

“Oh, no,” said Lood. 

We peered intently into the 
small hole without seeing any- 
thing. 

Then a faint wisp of steam 
came out of the hole. I walked 
over the grass, picked up a 
long twig, walked back and 
thrust it into the hole. I could 
not touch bottom, so some- 
thing was going on down 
there. 

The edges of the hole began 
to gleam with white metal. I 
was about to explain the alu- 
mina content of common clay, 
when the thin Commissioner 
and the tree stump he was 
sitting on went down with a 
whistling sound into a sudden 
pit that opened beneath him. 

I only just caught the third 
and last Commissioner in time. 

81 




We watched his tree stump 
sinking out of sight togther. 

The ground began to quiver 
uneasily. 

“Let us get out of here with 
all haste.” 

I followed the direction of 
the court with proper profes- 
sional zeal. And we just made 
it to the safe stressed-concrete 
surface of the old freeway 
when the park melted com- 
pletely into a stark framework 
of aluminum. Seated in the 
middle and peering at us 
through the aluminum cage 
were the other two Commis- 
sioners. They did not seem 
particularly happy. 

Around them in a widening 
belt there opened up a pit of 
gleaming aluminum, melting, 
so to speak, towards the hori- 
zon on all sides. 

“You realize, I suppose, Mr. 
Jones,” said the bald Commis- 
sioner beside me, “that your 
client is in the process of eat- 
ing up the Earth.” He breath- 
ed heavily. 

Lood was beaming and hop- 
ping up and down at the suc- 
cess of his experiment. I 
touched him in the general 
area of a shoulder. He looked 
at me. 

“No,” I said firmly, shaking 
my head. 

“No?” 

“No!” 

His round eyes became tear- 
ful and his little green body 
shook. 

“Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, 
dear.” 

82 



“Antiseptics?” I asked. 
“Oh, yus,” he confirmed 
sadly. 

V ERY fortunately, the fire 
department was still ob- 
serving my client — and me, 
I suspected afterwards, ridic- 
ulous as that may seem. 

This time it took them sev- 
eral hours of deep spraying 
and drilling to confine the 
area. A vast saucer of alumi- 
num remained. 

“Useful for signalling to 
stars, oh, yus?” asked Lood, 
hopefully. 

“Oh, no,” I said. 

A threatening cough made 
me turn round to see the three 
Commissioners staring at me. 
“Mr. Jones . .” 

“. you have now destroy- 
ed the Courthouse, the Public 
Library and five city blocks...” 
“. and buried them under 
a filthy layer of dust . .” 
"... and reduced a park in- 
to a great garbage pit. .” 
“. we therefore refuse 
your claim and give you and 
your client six hours to get 
off Earth ...” 

“. and kindly do not 
trouble to advise us where the 
Space Council moves you. We 
will sleep more soundly for 
believing that it will be many, 
many light-years away.” 

And they turned and walked 
away, leaving me with my cli- 
ent — and, apparently, my 
traveling companion. 

A quiet and suppressed sob- 
bing made me turn and look 

JAMES STAMERS 




at Lood. He wept dolefully. 

“We have nothing,” he said. 
“Oh, no. We have nothing to 
offer. Nothing that you hu- 
mans want.” 

“Well,” I said, “that’s the 
way it goes sometimes.” 

And what, I wondered, was 
I going to do for a living now? 

“Free food,” gulped Lood. 
“Free housing. Free gold and 
metals. We had all hoped so 
much from this, Oh, yus.” 

There did not seem any 
point in telling him his people 
were several hundred years 
too late. Once upon a time he 
would have been hailed as a 
savior of a starving and poor 
human race, a great benefac- 
tor of mankind. Now he was 
just a nuisance. And I was 
another for letting him loose. 

“Well,” I assured him, “you 
have got one guest until they 
shift you off your asteroid. 
Me. Free food and housing 
will suit me fine. And maybe 
we’ll find some very backward 
part of the Galaxy where they 
need gold and such. 

“It’s a pity,” I added, as 
we started to walk towards 



the spaceport, “that you can’t 
control these bacteria of 
yours.” 

“Can control.” 

“It didn’t look like it, my 
friend.” 

“Oh, yus. Can control bodi- 
ly leucocytes, corpuscles and 
such. Perfect cell replacement 
easy.” 

I looked down at him. 

“If it’s all that easy,” I 
said. “I suppose your old men 
can run faster than your 
houses.” 

“No old men,” said Lood. 

“Well, old whatever-you- 
are’s.” 

“No old. Not die. Oh, yus. 
Perfect cell replacement.” 

I stood very still. 

“Do you mean you never 
die?” I asked. 

“Oh, yus. Never die.” 

“Can teach?” I asked. 

“Oh, yus. Most simple,” 
smiled Lood. “Can teach all 
men not die. Not ever.” 

But I was off running after 
the three Commissioners, yell- 
ing until they stopped and 
stood waiting for me .

science briefs 



B Y the time this is in print, 
you may already have been 
irritated, once in a while, by 
background static riding in on 
the carrier wave of your fa- 
vorite radio station. If it isn’t 
Junior fiddling with a light- 
bulb or your neighbor’s gas- 
powered mulch-spreader with 
no suppressor on the plug, it 
could be Phantom, a double 
side-band radio system being 
tried out by the Armed Forces. 
Designed by General Electric, 
the method impresses infor- 
mation on the far outside 
edges of the band you’re lis- 
tening to, without affecting 
the middle at all, thus finding 
literally thousands of newly 

84 



available communications 
channels. 

Some of the satellites equip- 
ped with microphones have 
reported pings, pops, raps and 
bangs of an unexpected loud- 
ness. Professor Whipple of 
Harvard concludes that the 
noises are caused by extreme- 
ly fine dust in orbit around 
the Earth, very possibly the 
remains of comets. There 
seems to be a concentration 
of it at about 80 miles alti- 
tude. Professor Whipple feels 
that none of it is large enough 
to do appreciable damage, and 
that the noise is more a static- 
electricity phenomenon than 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 





a physical impact. He sug- 
gests, however, a thin outer 
shell for man-carrying cap- 
sules, so insulated that such 
noise could not reach the pi- 
lot. Harmless it may be. But it 
could be a terrifying experi- 
ence. 

We’ve all marvelled at devel- 
opments in microfilming, 
whether it was at the fantas- 
tic savings in the old-news- 
paper files at the major li- 
braries, or the International 
Geophysical Year weather 
readings — thousands upon 
thousands of them, taken from 
points all over the world for 
over eighteen months, and by 
microfilming reduced to a stack 
one man might lift. Now comes 
the National Bureau of stan- 
dards with a camera quite ca- 
pable of putting all the pages 
of this issue on a piece of film 
just big enough to make an 
eye-patch on Liberty’s por- 
trait on a dime. Time maga- 
zine says that it could put the 
27,357 pages of the Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica on the back 
of a match-book. In spite of 
cloak-and-dagger tales about 
entire paragraphs being con- 
cealed in a comma between 
clauses of a Dear John letter 
(and this gimmick could in- 
clude John’s life record doub- 
le-spaced, even if it was John 
Dillinger) the new camera will 
probably not be used for prac- 
tical microfilming. Working 
on the principle of what hap- 
pens when you look through 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



the wrong end of a telescope, 
the apparatus is so choosy, 
about focusing and so subject 
to interference from vibration 
(BuStandards envelopes the 
camera and the object to be 
photographed in a massive 
steel jacket suspended from 
springs) and dust (each sin- 
gle letter is about the size , of 
a single hoof-and-mouth di- 
sease germ) that it will be 
kept at work primarily at the 
job it was designed for — test- 
ing the resolving power of 
photographic emulsions. 

Pity the poor cancer — it must 
be as worried today as a polio 
bug! A brilliant advance in 
radiotherapy is reported from 
St. Thomas Hospital in Lon- 
don, England. The patient is 
placed in a giant tank which is 
supported horizontally only at 
one end. Round the tank ro- 
tate two massive therapy 
heads containing cobalt 60 — 
2000 curies of it. Precisely 
aimed, they rotate about a 
central point which is the can- 
cer — meaning that other tis- 
sues get only transient radia- 
tion while the cancer gets it 
constantly. The reason for the 
sealed tank is that it enables 
the patient to breathe high- 
pressure oxygen, and the rea- 
son for that is that cancer 
cells are often deficient in ox- 
ygen and therefore up to three 
times less sensitive to radia- 
tion as normal ones. This tech- 
nique brings up the concen- 
tration of oxygen in the can- 

85 




cer while the radiation beams 
are clobbering it. To accom- 
plish this, the patient must 
breathe high-pressure oxygen 
through a mask. And to make 
this possible, his entire body 
must be pressurized — hence 
the tank. The entire apparatus 
is walled in by thick concrete, 
with a five-inch-thick viewing 
window of leaded glass and 
remote controls. Wich heavy 
artillery like this around, can- 
cer might as well give up and 
go! 

Contrary to the beliefs and/ 
or wistful hopes of many a 
s-f aficionado, biologically ali- 
en life — that is, alien to Earth 
norms — is unlikely or impos- 
sible, so good-by boron beast 
with cuprous blood, farewell 
silicon monsters! Dr. George 
Wald, a Professor of Biology 
at Harvard, asserts not only 
that living organisms every- 
where must be constructed of 
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and 
nitrogen, but that they must 
also have water and radiation 
— specifically that between 
300 and 1100 microns — avail- 
able. 

On the other hand, perhaps 
you feel more at home in the 
universe now! 

You may take this as a joke, 
grin and laugh it off ; you may 
feel offended, and say this is 
no place for such information 
and advice. Either way, any 
way — keep it in mind. 

The information: Dr. Leon 



Rosen of the United States 
Public Health Service says 
that the isolation of the virus 
of infectious hepatitis is "the 
No. 1 unsolved problem of 
contemporary virology.” In- 
fectious hepatitis is a liver 
disease for which there is no 
known cure. It is on the in- 
crease, and is now the third 
most prevalent disease in the 
U.S. Seldom deadly, it is 
acutely debilitating and a 
great masquerader, being diffi- 
cult to diagnose and so far 
impossible to treat except by 
rest and good diet. It is not 
the same thing as serum hepa- 
titis, a rare and dangerous 
disease caught from improp- 
erly sterilized injection need- 
les. Infectious hepatitis can be 
caught in several ways, like 
polluted water, but most of it 
comes from person-to-person 
contact and its source is al- 
ways the lower intestine. 
There is only one sure thing 
you can do about it, for your- 
self and your children, if any: 
Wash your hands every time! 

Earthbound Dr. Kurt Komar- 
ek of New York University 
has thought his way out of 
disaster on the moon! He rea- 
soned that oxygen supply on 
a space ship is necessarily 
limited, and even with a com- 
pletely efficient recycling sys- 
tem — plants, for example, 
returning oxygen and absorb- 
ing C02 — there is still a cer- 
tain amount aboard, in or out 
of combination. And it cannot 



86 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 




go up or stay the same: it 
must go down. Especially af- 
ter landing, with airlocks in 
use, and with inevitable es- 
cape from suit joints, etc. Re- 
calling the amount of iron in 
meteorites, and knowing it 
must be combined with some- 
thing, and that probably oxy- 
gen, Dr. Komarek tried heat- 
ing a meteorite in a hydrogen 
atmosphere. There was oxy- 
gen all right — 4 pounds for 
each 100 pounds of meteorite ! 
As it left the heated material, 
it combined with the hydro- 
gen to form water vapor, from 
which the oxygen could be 
separated by electrolysis. He 
calculates that by processing 
not more than 200 pounds of 
meteorites a month, enough 
oxygen could be recovered to 
replace the losses of a 5-man 
team indefinitely ! 

Certain aspects of the “scien- 
tific attitude” could well be 
copied by the rest of humani- 
ty. Years ago nations began 
to pool weather information; 
this work was correlated and 
was vastly expanded during 
the International Geophysical 
Year, and now continues at 
a high level. The recently 
opened Tokyo Weather Cen- 
tral is the fifth large infor- 
mation center to be opened 
round the world. There is a 
constant free exchange of in- 
formation in weather covering 
the entire northern hemi- 
sphere, including Russia and 
the United States. Another ex- 



ample : in preparation for the 
IGY, many long-range experi- 
ments were prepared far in 
advance. One of these was a 
seismograph station on bed- 
rock deep underground in the 
city of Budapest. Seismic 
tracings from that laboratory 
can be seen today showing dis- 
turbances from Russian tanks 
as the 1956 fighting rolled 
back and forth through the 
city. These faint squiggles on 
paper tape speak eloquently 
of the single-mindedness of 
the scientists who stayed on 
the job in their laboratory, 
never missing a reading or an 
entry, while their personal 
world fell to pieces on the 
streets above. 

Dr. David Nachmansohn, Pro- 
fessor of Biochemistry at Co- 
lumbia, has announced re- 
markable new findings on the 
exact nature of nerves and 
their operation. It seems that 
the “bio-electricity” present in 
body fluids, in the form of 
sodium ions, is blocked from 
entry into a nerve by a fatty 
substance. This substance is 
made permeable by the chemi- 
cal acetylcholine after it com- 
bines with a certain protein 
in the barrier. The nerve may 
then conduct. But if it con- 
ducted longer than a few mil- 
lionths of a second the nerve 
might become paralyzed. So 
another substance, the enzyme 
cholinesterase, acts to destroy 
the compound. All this to 
scratch your nose! end

IF 'fN^ovelette 



By ALLEN KIM LANG Illustrated by GAUGHAN 





I 

T HE First Vice-President of 
the William Howard Taft 
National Bank and Trust 
Company, the gentleman to 
whom Miss Orison McCall was 
applying for a job, was not at 
all the public picture of a 
banker. His suit of hound’s- 
tooth checks, the scarlet vest 



peeping above the vee of his 
jacket, were enough to assure 
Orison that the Taft Bank was 
a curious bank indeed. “I 
gotta say, chick, these refer- 
ences of yours really swing,” 
said the Vice-President, Mr. 
Wanji. “Your last boss says 
you come on real cool in the 
secretary-bit.” 

“He was a very kind em- 



88 






ployer,” Orison said. She tried 
to keep from staring at the 
most remarkable item of Mr. 
Wanji’s costume, a pair of 
furry green earmuffs. It was 
not cold. 

Mr. Wanji returned to Ori- 
son her letters of reference. 
“What color bread you got 
eyes for taking down, baby?” 
he asked. 



What a bank! 

The First Vice-President was 
a cool cat — the elevator 
and the money 
operators all wore earmuffs — 
was just as phony as a 
three-dollar bill! 



“Beg pardon?” 

“What kinda salary you 
bucking for?” he translated, 
bouncing up and down on the 
toes of his rough-leather des- 
ert boots. 

“I was making one-twenty 
a week in my last position,” 
Miss McCall said. 

“You’re worth more’n that, 
just to jazz up the decor,” Mr. 

89 



CINDERELLA STORY 




Wanji said. "What you say we 
pass you a cee-and-a-half a 
week. Okay?” He caught Ori- 
son’s look of bewilderment. 
"One each, a Franklin and a 
Grant,” he explained further. 
She still looked blank. “Sister, 
you gonna work in a bank, 
you gotta know who’s pic- 
ture’s on the paper. That’s a 
hunnerd-fifty a week, doll.” 

"That will be most satisfac- 
tory, Mr. Wanji,” Orison said. 
It was indeed. 

"Crazy !” Mr. Wanji grabbed 
Orison’s right hand and shook 
it with athletic vigor. "You 
just now joined up with our 
herd. I wanna tell you, chick, 
it's none too soon we got some 
decent scenery around this 
tomb, girlwise.” He took her 
arm and led her toward the 
bank of elevators. The uni- 
formed operator nodded to 
Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly to 
Orison. He, -too, she observed, 
wore earmuffs. His were more 
formal than Mr. Wanji’s, be- 
ing midnight blue in color. 
"Lift us to five, Mac,” Mr. 
Wanji said. As the elevator 
dopr shut he explained to Ori- 
son, "You can make the Taft 
Bank scene anywhere between 
the street floor and floor five. 
Basement and everything 
higher’n fifth floor is Iron 
Curtain Country far’s you’re 
concerned. Dig, baby?” 

"Yes, sir,” Orison said. She 
was wondering if she’d be 
issued earmuffs, now that 
she’d become an employee of 
this most peculiar bank. 



The elevator opened on five 
to a tiny office, just large 
enough to hold a single desk 
and two chairs. On the desk 
were a telephone and a micro- 
phone. Beside them was a 
double-decked "In” and "Out” 
basket. "Here’s where you’ll 
do your nine-to-five, honey,” 
Mr. Wanji said. 

“What will I be doing, Mr. 
Wanji?” Orison asked. 

The Vice-President pointed 
to the newspaper folded in the 
“In” basket. "Flip on the mi- 
crophone and read the paper 
to it,” he said. "When you get 
done reading the paper, some- 
one will run you up something 
new to read. Okay?” 

“It seems a rather peculiar 
job,” Orison said. “After all, 
I’m a secretary. Is reading the 
newspaper aloud supposed to 
familiarize me with the Bank's 
operation?” 

"Don’t bug me, kid,” Mr. 
Wanji said. "All you gotta do 
is read that there paper into 
this here microphone. Can 
do?” 

“Yes, sir,” Orison said. 
"While you’re here, Mr. Wan- 
ji, I’d like to ask you about my 
withholding tax, social secur- 
ity, credit union, coffee-breaks, 
union membership, lunch hour 
and the like. Shall we take 
care of these details now? 
Or would you — ” 

“You just take care of that 
chicken-flickin’ kinda stuff any 
way seems best to you, kid,” 
Mr. Wanji said. 

"Yes, sir,” Orison said. This 



90 



ALLEN KIM LANG 




laissez-faire policy of Taft 
Bank’s might explain why 
she’d been selected from the 
Treasury Department’s secre- 
tarial pool to apply for work 
here, she thought. Orison Mc- 
Call, girl Government spy. She 
picked up the newspaper from 
the “In” basket, unfolded it to 
discover the day’s Wall Street 
Journal, and began at the top 
of column one to read it aloud. 
Wanji stood before the desk, 
nodding his head as he lis- 
tened. “You blowing real good, 
kid,” he said. “The boss is 
gonna dig you the most.” 
Orison nodded. Holding her 
newspaper and her micro- 
phone, she read the one into 
the other. Mr. Wanji flicked 
his fingers in a good-by, then 
took off upstairs in the ele- 
vator. 

B Y lunchtime Orison had 
finished the Wall Street 
Journal and had begun read- 
ing a book an earmuffed page 
had brought her. The book 
was a fantastic novel of some 
sort, named The Hobbit. Read- 
ing this peculiar fare into the 
microohone before her, Miss 
McCall was more certain than 
ever that the Taft Bank was, 
as her boss in Washington had 
told her, the front for some 
highly irregular goings-on. An 
odd business for a Federal 
Mata Hari, Orison thought, 
reading a nonsense story into 
a microphone for an invisible 
audience. 

Orison switched off her mi- 



crophone at noon, marked her 
place in the book and took the 
elevator down to the ground 
floor. The operator was a new 
man, ears concealed behind 
scarlet earmuffs. In the car, 
coming down from the inter- 
dicted upper floors, were sev- 
eral gentlemen with brief- 
cases. As though they were 
members of a ballet-troupe, 
these gentlemen whipped off 
their hats with a single mo- 
tion as Orison stepped aboard 
the elevator. Each of the chi- 
valrous men, hat pressed to his 
heart, wore a pair of earmuffs. 
Orison nodded bemused ac- 
knowledgment of their ges- 
ture, and got off in the lobby 
vowing never to put a penny 
into this curiousest of banks. 

Lunch at the stand-up coun- 
ter down the street was a nor- 
mal interlude. Girls from the 
ground-floor offices of Taft 
Bank chattered together, eyed 
Orison with the coolness due 
so attractive a competitor, and 
favored her with no gambit to 
enter their conversations. Ori- 
son sighed, finished her tuna 
salad on whole-wheat, then 
went back upstairs to her lone- 
ly desk and her microphone. 
By five, Orison had finished 
the book, reading rapidly and 
becoming despite herself en- 
gross 3d in the saga of Bilbo 
Baggins, Hobbit. She switched 
off the microphone, put on her 
light coat, and rode down- 
stairs in an elevator filled 
with earmuffed. silent, hat- 
clasping gentlemen.

What I need, Orison thought, 
walking rapidly to the busline, 
is a double Scotch, followed by 
a double Scotch. And what the 
William Howard Taft Nation- 
al Bank and Trust Company 
needs is a joint raid by forces 
of the U.S. Treasury Depart- 
ment and the American Psy- 
chiatric Association. Ear- 
muffs, indeed. Fairy-tales read 
into a microphone. A Vice- 
President with the vocabulary 
of a racetrack tout. And what 
goes on in those upper floors? 
Orison stopped in at the res- 
taurant nearest her apartment 
house — the Windsor Arms — 
and ordered a meal and a sin- 
gle Martini. Her boss in Wash- 
ington had told her that this 
job of hers, spying on Taft 
Bank from within, might 
prove dangerous. Indeed it 
was, she thought. She was in 
danger of becoming a solitary 
drinker. 

Home in her apartment, 
Orison set the notes of her 
first day’s observations in 
order. Presumably Washing- 
ton would call tonight for her 
initial report. Item: some of 
the men at the Bank wore ear- 
muffs, several didn’t. Item: 
the Vice-President’s name was 
Mr. Wanji: Oriental? Item: 
the top eight floors of the Taft 
Bank Building seemed to be 
off-limits to all personnel not 
wearing earmuffs. Item: she 
was being employed at a very 
respectable salary to read 
newsprint and nonsense into 
a microphone. Let Washing- 

92 



ton make sense of that, she 
thought. 

I N a gloomy mood. Orison 
McCall showered and 
dressed for bed. Eleven 
o’clock. Washington should be 
calling soon, inquiring after 
the results of her first day’s 
spying. 

No call. Orison slipped be- 
tween the sheets at eleven- 
thirty. The clock was set; the 
lights were out. Wasn’t Wash- 
ington going to call her? Per- 
haps, she thought, the Depart- 
ment had discovered that the 
Earmuffs had her phone 
tapped. i 

“Testing,” a baritone voice 
muttered. 

Orison sat up, clutching the 
sheet around her throat. “Beg 
pardon?” she said. 

“Testing,” the male voice 
repeated. “One, two, three; 
three, two, one. Do you read 
me? Over.” 

Orison reached under the 
bed for a shoe. Gripping it 
like a Scout-ax, she reached 
for the light cord with her free 
hand and tugged at it. 

The room was empty. 
“Testing,” the voice re- 
peated. 

“What you’re testing,” Ori- 
son said in a firm voice, “is 
my patience. Who are you?” 
“Department of Treasury 
Monitor J-12,” the male voice 
said. “Do you have anything 
to report, Miss McCall?” 
“Where are you, Monitor?” 
she demanded. 



ALLEN KIM LANG 




“That’s classified informa- 
tion,” the voice said. “Please 
speak directly to your pillow, 
Miss McCall.” 

Orison lay down cautiously. 
“All right,” she whispered to 
her pillow. 

“Over here,” the voice in- 
structed her, coming from the 
unruffled pillow beside her. 

Orison transferred her head 
to the pillow to her left. “A 
radio?” she asked. 

“Of a sort,” Monitor J-12 
agreed. “We have to maintain 
communications security. 
Have you anything to report?” 

“I got the job,” Orison said. 
“Are you ... in that pillow 
... all the time?” 

“No, Miss McCall,” the 
voice said. “Only at report 
times. Shall we establish our 
rendezvous here at eleven -fif- 
teen, Central Standard Time, 
every day?” 

“You make it sound so im- 
proper,” Orison said. 

“I’m far enough away to do 
you no harm, Miss McCall,” 
the monitor said. “Now, tell 
me what happened at the bank 
today.” 

Orison briefed her pillow on 
the Earmuffs. on her task of 
reading to a microphone, and 
on the generally mimsy tone 
of the William Howard Taft 
National Bank and Trust Com- 
pany. “That’s about it, so far,” 

e Vi o oqi^ 

“Good report,” J-12 said 
from the pillow. “Sounds like 
you’ve dropped into a real 
snakepit, beautiful.” 

CINDERELLA STORY 



“How do you know . why 
do you think I’m beautiful?” 
Orison asked. 

“Native optimism,” the 
voice said. “Good night.” J-12 
signed off with a peculiar elec- 
tronic pop that puzzled Orison 
for a moment. Then she placed 
the sound : J-12 had kissed his 
microphone. 

Orison flung the shoe and 
the pillow under her bed, and 
resolved to write Washington 
for permission to make her 
future reports by registered 
mail. 

II 

A T ten o’clock the next 
morning, reading page 
four of the current Wall Street 
Journal, Orison was inter- 
rupted by the click of a pair 
of leather heels. The gentle- 
man whose heels had just 
slammed together was bowing. 
And she saw with some grati- 
fication that he was not wear- 
ing earmuffs. “My name,” the 
stranger said, “is Dink Gerd- 
ing. I am President of this 
bank, and wish at this time to 
welcome you to our little fam- 
ily.” 

“I’m Orison McCall,” she 
said. A handsome man, she 
mused. Twenty-eight? So tall. 
Could he ever be interested in 
a girl just five-foot-three? 
Maybe higher heels? 

“We’re pleased with your 
work, Miss McCall,” Dink 
Gerding said. He took the 
chair to the right of her desk. 

93 




“It’s nothing,’’ Orison said, 
switching off the microphone. 

“On the contrary, Miss Mc- 
Call. Your duties are most im- 
portant,” he said. 

“Reading papers and fairy- 
tales into this microphone is 
nothing any reasonably astute 
sixth-grader couldn’t do as 
well,” Orison said. 

“You’ll be reading silently 
before long,” Mr. Gerding 
said. He smiled, as though this 
explained everything. “By the 
way, your official designation 
is Confidential Secretary. It’s 
me whose confidences you’re to 
keep secret. If I ever need a 
letter written, may I stop 
down here and dictate it?” 

“Please do,” Orison said. 
This bank president, for all 
his grace and presence, was 
obviously as kookie as his 
bank. 

“Have you ever worked in 
a bank before, Miss McCall?” 
Mr. Gerding asked, as though 
following her train of thought. 

“No, sir,” she said. “Though 
I’ve been associated with a 
rather large financial organi- 
zation.” 

“You may find some of our 
methods a little strange, but 
you’ll get used to them,” he 
said. “Meanwhile, I’d be most 
grateful if you’d dispense with 
calling me ‘sir.’ My name is 
Dink. It is ridiculous, but I’d 
enjoy your using it.” 

“Dink?” she asked. “And I 
suppose you’re to call me Ori- 
son?” 

“That’s the drill,” he said. 
94 



“One more question, Orison. 
Dinner this evening?” 

Direct, she thought. Per- 
haps that’s why he’s president 
of a bank, and still so young. 
“We’ve hardly met,” she said. 

“But we’re on a first-name 
basis already,” he pointed out. 
“Dance?” 

“I’d love to,” Orison said, 
half expecting an orchestra to 
march, playing, from the ele- 
vator. 

“Then I’ll pick you up at 
seven. Windsor Arms, if I re- 
member your personnel form 
correctly.” He stood, lean, all 
bone and muscle, and bowed 
slightly. West Point? Hardly. 
His manners were European. 
Sandhurst, perhaps, or Saint 
Cyr. Was she supposed to re- 
ply with a curtsy? Orison 
wondered. 

“Thank you,” she said. 

He was & soldier, or had 
been : the way, when he 

turned, his shoulders stayed 
square. The crisp clicking of 
his steps, a military metro- 
nome, to the elevator. When 
the door slicked open Orison, 
staring after Dink, saw that 
each of the half-dozen men 
aboard snapped off their hats 
(but not their earmuffs) and 
bowed, the earmuffed opera- 
tor bowing with them. Small 
bows, true; just head-and- 
neck. But not to her. To Dink 
Gerding. 

O RISON finished the Wall 
Street Journal by early 
afternoon. A page came up a 

ALLEN KIM LANG 




moment later with fresh read- 
ing-matter: a copy of yester- 
day’s Congressional Record. 
She launched into the Record,. 
thinking as she read of meet- 
ing again this evening that 
handsome madman, that splen- 
did lunatic, that unlikely bank- 
president. “You read so well, 
darling,” someone said across 
the desk. 

Orison looked up. “Oh, 
hello,” she said. “I didn’t hear 
you come up.” 

“I walk ever so lightly,” the 
woman said, standing hip-shot 
in front of the desk, “and 
pounce ever so hard.” She 
smiled. Opulent, Orison 
thought. Built like a burlesque 
queen. No, she thought, I 
don’t like her. Can’t. Wouldn’t 
if I could. Never cared for 
c<its 

“I’m Orison McCall,” she 
said, and tried to smile back 
without showing teeth. 

“Delighted,” the visitor 
said, handing over an unde- 
lighted palm. “I’m Auga 
Vingt. Auga, to my friends.” 

“Won’t you sit down, Miss 
Vingt?” 

“So kind of you, darling,” 
Auga Vingt said, “but I shan’t 
have time to visit. I just 
wanted to stop and welcome 
you as a Taft Bank co-worker. 
One for all. all for one. Yea t 
Team. You know.” 

“Thanks,” Orison said. 

“Common courtesv,” Miss 
Vingt explained. “Also, darl- 
ing, I’d like to draw your at- 
tention to one little point. 

CINDERELLA STORY 



Dink Gerding — you know, the 
shoulders and muscles and 
crewcut? Well, he’s posted 
property. Should you throw 
your starveling charms at my 
Dink, you’d only get your little 
eyes scratched out. Word to 
the wise, rCest-ce pas?” 

“Sorry you have to leave so 
suddenly,” Orison said, rolling 
her Wall Street Journal into a 
club and standing. “Darling.” 

“So remember, Tiny, Dink 
Gerding is mine. You’re all 
alone up here. You could get 
broken nails, fall down the ele- 
vator shaft, all sorts of an- 
noyance. Understand me, darl- 
ing?” 

“You make it very clear,” 
Orison said. “Now you’d best 
hurry back to your stanchion. 
Bossy, before the hay’s all 
gone.” 

"Isn’t it lovely, the way you 
and I reached an understand- 
ing right off?” Auga asked. 
“Well, ta-ta.” She -turned and 
walked to the elevator, dis- 
playing, Orison thought, a dis- 
graceful amount of ungirdled 
rhumba motion. 

The elevator stopped to pick 
up the odious Auga. A passen- 
ger, male, stepped off. “Good 
morning, Mr. Gerding,” Miss 
Vingt said, bowing. 

“Carry on, Colonel,” the 
stranger replied. As the eleva- 
tor door closed, he stepped up 
to Orison’s desk. “Good morn- 
ing. Miss McCall.” he said. 

“What is this?” Orison de- 
manded. “Visiting-day at the 
zoo?” She paused and shook 

95 




her head. “Excuse me, sir,” 
she said. “It’s just that . 
Vingt thing . .” 

“Auga is rather intense," 
the new Mr. Gerding said. 

“Yeah, intense,” Orison 
said. “Like a kidney-stone.” 

“I stopped by to welcome 
you to the William Howard 
Taft National Bank and Trust 
Company family, Miss Mc- 
Call,” he said. “I’m Kraft 
Gerding, Dink’s elder brother. 
I understand you've met Dink 
already.” 

“Yes, sir,” Orison said. The 
hair of this new Mr. Gerding 
was cropped even closer than 
Dink’s. His mustache was 
gray-tipped, like a patch of 
frosted furze; and his eyes, 
like Dink’s, were cobalt blue. 
The head, Orison mused, 
would look quite at home in 
one of Kaiser Bill’s spike- 
topped Pickelhauben; but the 
ears were in evidence, and 
seemed normal. Mr. Kraft 
Gerding bowed — what conti- 
nental manners these bankers 
had! — and Orison half ex- 
pected him to free her hand 
from the rolled-up paper she 
still clutched and plant a kiss 
on it. 

I NSTEAD, Kraft Gerding 
smiled a smile as frosty 
as his mustache and said, “I 
understand that my younger 
brother has been talking with 
you. Miss McCall. Quite prop- 
er, I knqw. But I must warn 
you against mixing business 
with pleasure.” 



Orison jumped up, tossing 
the paper into her wastebask- 
et. “I quit!” she shouted. “You 
can take this crazy bank . 
into bankruptcy, for all I care. 
I’m not going to perch up here, 
target for every uncaged idiot 
in finance, and listen to an- 
other word.” 

“Dearest lady, my humblest 
pardon,” Kraft Gerding said, 
bowing again, a bit lower. 
“Your work is splendid ; your 
presence is Taft Bank’s most 
charming asset; my only wish 
is to serve and protect you. 
To this end, dear lady, I feel it 
my duty to warn you against 
my brother. A word to the 
wise . .” 

“N’est-ce pas?” Orison said. 
“Well, Buster, here’s a word 
to the foolish. Get lost.” ' 

Kraft Gerding bowed and 
flashed his gelid smile. “Until 
we meet again?” 

“I’ll hold my breath,” Ori- 
son promised. “The elevator is 
just behind you. Push a but- 
ton, will you? And bon voy- 
age” 

Kraft Gerding called the 
elevator, marched aboard, fa- 
vored Orison with a cold, 
quick bow, then disappeared 
into the mysterious heights 
above fifth floor. 

First the unspeakable Auga 
Vingt, then the obnoxious 
Kraft Gerding. Surely, Orison 
thought, recovering the Wall 
Street Journal from her 
wastebasket and smoothing it, 
no one would convert a major 
Midwestern bank into a luna-

tic asylum. How else, though, 
could the behavior of the Ear- 
muffs be explained? Could 
madmen run a bank? Why not, 
she thought. History is rich in 
examples of madmen running 
nations, banks and all. She be- 
gan again to read the paper 
into the microphone. If she 
finished early enough, she 
might get a chance to prowl 
those Off-Limits upper floors. 

Half an hour further into 
the paper, Orison jumped, 
startled by the sudden buzz of 
her telephone. She picked it 
up. "Wanji e-Kal, Datto. Dink 
ger-Dink d’summa.” 

Orison scribbled down this 
intelligence in bemused Gregg 
before replying, “I’m a local 
girl. Try me in English.” 

“Oh. Hi, Miss McCall.” the 
voice said. “Guess I goofed. 
I’m in kinda clutch. This is 
Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. 
Dink Gerding. If you see him, 
tell him the escudo green is 
pale. Got that, doll?” 

“Yes, Mr. Wanji. I’ll tell 
Mr. Gerding.” Orison clicked 
the phone down. What now, 
Mata Hari? she asked herself. 
What was the curious lan- 
guage Mr. Wanji had used? 
She’d have to report the mes- 
sage to Washington bv to- 
night’s pillow, and let the poly- 
glots of Treasury Intelligence 
puzzle it out. Meanwhile, she 
thought, scooting her chair 
back from her desk, she had a 
vague excuse to prowl the 
upper floors. The Earmuffs 
could only fire her. 

CINDERELLA STORY 



Orison folded the paper and 
put it in the “Out” basket. 
Someone would be here in a 
moment with something new 
to read. She’d best get going. 
The elevator? No. The opera- 
tors had surely been in- 
structed to keep her off the 
upstairs floors. 

But the building had a stair- 
way. 

Ill 

T HE door on the sixth floor 
was locked. Orison went on 
up the stairs to seven. The 
glass of the door there was 
painted black on the inside, 
and the landing was cellar- 
dark. Orison closed her eyes 
for a moment. There was a 
curious sound. The buzzing of 
a million bees, barely within 
the fringes of her hearing. 
Somehow, a very pleasant 
sound. 

She opened- her eyes and 
tried the knob. The door 
opened. 

Orison was blinded by the 
lights,, brilliant as noonday 
sun. The room extended 
through the entire seventh 
floor, its windows boarded 
shut, its ceiling a mass of 
fluorescent lamps. Set about 
the floor were galvanized steel 
tanks, rectangular and a little 
bigger than bathtubs. Orison 
counted the rows of tanks. 
Twelve rows, nine tiers. One 
hundred and eight tanks. She 
walked closer. The tubs were 
laced together by strands of 

97 




angel-hair, delicate white lat- 
tices scintillating with pink. 
She walked to the nearest of 
the tubs and looked in. It was 
half full of a greenish fluid, 
seething with tiny pink bub- 
bles. For a moment Orison 
thought she saw Benjamin 
Franklin winking up at her 
from the liquid. Then she 
screamed. 

The pink bubbles, the tiny 
flesh-colored flecks glinting 
light from the spun-sugar 
bridges between the tanks, 
were spiders. Millions upon 
millions of spiders, each the 
size of a mustard-seed ; crawl- 
ing, leaping, swinging, spin- 
ning webs, seething in the 
hundred tanks. Orison put her 
hands over her ears and 
screamed again, backing to- 
ward the stairway door. 

Into a pair of arms. 

“I had hoped you’d be happy 
here, Miss McCall,” Kraft 
Gerding said. Orison struggled 
to release herself. She broke 
free only to have her wrists 
seized by two Earmuffs that 
had appeared with the elder 
Gerding. “It seems that our 
Pandora doesn’t care for spid- 
ers,” he said. “Really, Miss 
McCall, our little pets are 
quite harmless. Were we to 
toss you into one of these 
tanks . .” Orison struggled 
against her two sumo-sized 
captors, whose combined 
weights exceeded hers by some 
quarter-ton, without doing 
more than lifting her feet 
from the floor. “. your flesh 

98 



would be unharmed, though 
they spun and darted all 
around you. Our Microfabri- 
dae are petrovorous, Miss Mc- 
Call. Of course, once they dis- 
covered your teeth, and 
through them a skeleton of 
calcium, a delicacy they find 
most toothsome, you’d be fil- 
leted within minutes.” 

“Elder Compassion wouldn’t 
like your harming the girl, 
Sire,” one of the earmuffed 
sumo-wrestlers protested. 

“Elder Compassion has no 
rank,” Kraft Gerding said. 
“Miss McCall, you must tell 
me what you were doing here, 
or I’ll toss you to the spiders.” 
“Dink . Dink!” Orison 
shouted. 

“My beloved younger broth- 
er is otherwise engaged than 
in the rescue of damsels in dis- 
tress,” Kraft said. "Someone, 
after all, has to mind the 
bank.” 

“I came to bring a message 
to Dink,” Orison said. “Let me 
go, you acromegalic apes!” 
“The message?” Kraft Gerd- 
ing demanded. 

“Something about escudo 
green. Put me down !” 

S UDDENLY she was 
dropped. Her mountainous 
keepers were on the floor as 
though struck by lightning, 
their arms thrown out before 
them, their faces abject 
against the floor. Kraft Gerd- 
ing was slowly lowering him- 
self to one knee. Dink had 
entered the spider-room. With- 

ALLEN KIM LANG 




out questions, he strode be- 
tween the shiko-ing Earmuffs 
and put his arms around Ori- 
son. 

“They can’t harm you,” he 
said. She turned to press her 
face against his chest. “You’re 
all right, child. Breathe deep, 
swallow, and turn your brain 
back on. All right, now?” 

“All right,” she said, still 
trembling. “They were going 
to throw me to the spiders.” 
“Kraft told you that?” Dink 
Gerding released her and 
turned to the kneeling man. 
“Stand up, Elder Brother.” 

“I . .” 

Dink brought his right fist 
up from hip-level, crashing it 
into Kraft’s jaw. Kraft Gerd- 
ing joined the Earmuffs on the 
floor. 

“If you’d care to stand 
again, Elder Brother, you may 
attempt to recover your dig- 
nity without regard for the 
difference in our rank.” Kraft 
struggled to one knee and re- 
mained kneeling, gazing up at 
Dink through half-closed eyes. 
“No? Then get out of here, all 
of you. Samma!” 

Kraft Gerding arose, stared 
for a moment at Dink and 
Orison, then, with the merest 
hint of a bow, led his two 
giant Earmuffs to the elevator. 

“I wish you hadn’t come up 
here, Orison,” Dink said. 
“Why did you do it?” 

“Have you read the story of 
Bluebeard?” Orison asked. She 
stood close to Dink, keeping 
her eyes on the nearest spider- 

CINDERELLA STORY 



tank. “I had to see what it was 
you kept up here so secretly, 
what it was that I was forbid- 
den to see. My excuse was to 
have been that I was looking 
for you, to deliver a message 
from Mr. Wanji. He said T 
was to tell you that the escudo 
green is pale.” 

“You’re too curious, and 
Wanji is too careless,” Dink 
said. “Now, what is this thing 
you have about spiders?” 

“I’ve always been terrified 
of them,” Orison said. “When 
I was a little girl, I had to stay 
upstairs all day one Sunday 
because there was a spider 
hanging from his thread in the 
stairway. I waited until Dad 
came home and took it down 
with a broom. Even then, I 
didn’t have appetite for sup- 
per.” 

“Strange,” Dink said. He 
walked over to the nearest 
tank and plucked one of the 
tiny pink creatures from a 
web-bridge. “This is no spider, 
Orison,” he said. 

She backed away from Dink 
Gerding and the minuscule 
creature he cupped in the palm 
of his hand. "These are Micro- 
fabridae, more nearly related 
to shellfish than to spiders,” 
he said. “They’re stone-and- 
metal eaters. They literally 
couldn’t harm a fly. Look at 
it. Orison.” He extended his 
palm. Orison forced herself to 
look. The little creature, flesh- 
colored against his flesh, was 
nearly invisible, scuttling 
around the bowl of his hand. 

99 




“Pretty little fellow, isn’t he?” 
Dink asked. “Here. Yon hold 
him.’’ 

“I’d rattier not,” she pro- 
tested. 

“I’d be happier if you did,” 
Dink said. 

O RISON extended her hand 
as into a furnace. Dink 
brushed the Microfabridus 
from hispalm to hers. It felt 
crisp and hard, like a legged 
grain of sand. Dink took a 
magnifier from his pocket and 
unfolded it, to hold it over 
Orison’s palm. 

“He’s like a baby crawdad,” 
Orison said. 

“A sort of crustacean,” 
Dink agreed. “We use them in 
a commercial process we’re 
developing. That’s why we 
keep this floor closed off and 
secret. We don’t have a patent 
on the use of Microfabridae, 
you see.” 

“What do they do?” Orison 
asked. 

“That’s still a secret,” Dink 
said, smiling. “I can’t tell even 
you that, not yet, even though 
you’re my most confidential 
secretary.” 

“What’s he doing now?” 
Orison asked, watching the 
Microfabridus, perched up on 
the rear four of his six micro- 
scopic legs, scratching against 
her high-school class-ring with 
his tiny chelae. 

“They like gold,” Dink ex- 
plained, peering across her 
shoulder, comfortably close. 
“They’re attracted to it by a 

100 



chemical tropism, as children 
are attracted to candy. Toss 
him back into his tank, Orison. 
We’d better get you down 
where you belong.” 

Orison brushed the midget 
crustacean off her finger into 
the nearest tank, where he 
joined the busy boil of his fel- 
lows. She felt her ring. It was 
pitted where the Micro- 
fabridus had been nibbling. 
“Strange, using crawdads in a 
bank,” she said. She stood si- 
lent for a moment. “I thought 
I heard music,” she said. “I 
heard it when I came in. 
Something like the sighing of 
wind in winter trees.” 

“That’s the hymn of the 
Microfabridae,” Dink said. 
“They all sing together while 
they work, a chorus of some 
twenty million voices.” He 
took her arm. “If you listen 
very carefully, you’ll find the 
song these little workers sing 
the most beautiful music in the 
world.” 

Orison closed her eyes, lean- 
ing back into Dink’s arms, 
listening to the music that 
seemed on the outermost edge 
of her hearing. Wildness, 
storm and danger were its 
theme, counterpointed by 
promises of peace and harbor. 
She heard the wash of giant 
waves in the song, the crash 
of breakers against granite, 
cold and insatiable. And be- 
hind this, the quiet of shel- 
tered tide-pools, the soft lub 
of sea-arms landlocked. “It’s 
an ancient song,” Dink said.

“The Microfabridae have been 
singing it for a million years.” 
He released her, and opened 
a wood-covered wooden box. 
He scooped up a cupful of the 
sand inside. “Hold out your 
hands,” he told Orison. He 
filled them with the sand. 
“Throw our singers some sup- 
per for their song,” he said. 

Orison went with her 
cupped hands to the nearest 
tank and sprinkled the miner- 
al fishfood around inside it. 
The Microfabridae leaped 
from the liquid like miniature 
porpoises, seizing the grains 
of sand in mid-air. “They’re 
so very strange,” Orison said. 
At the bottom of the tank she 
thought she saw Ben Franklin 
again, winking at her through 
the bubbling life. Nonsense, 
she thought, brushing her 
hands. 

D INK took her to the ele- 
vator and pressed the 
“Down” button. “Don’t come 
up here again unless I bring 
you,” he said. “The Micro- 
fabridae aren’t dangerous, de- 
spite what my brother told 
you, but some of our processes 
might involve some risk to by- 
standers. So don’t take any 
more tours above the fifth 
floor without me as your 
guide. All right, Orison?” 
“Yes, Dink.” 

The elevator stopped. “Take 
the lady to her office,” Dink 
told the bowing, earmuffed 
operator. “And Orison,” he 
said, just before the door 



closed, “I’m really not a Blue- 
beard. See you this evening.” 
Dink Gerding, wearing an 
ordinary enough suit, well-cut, 
expensive, but nothing extra- 
ordinary for a banker, called 
for Orison at seven. He’d look 
well, she thought, slipping in- 
to the coat he held for her, in 
a white uniform brocaded with 
pounds of spun gold, broad 
epaulettes, a stiff bank of 
extravagantly-colored ribbons 
across his chest ; perhaps rest- 
ing his right hand on the pom- 
mel of a dress saber. “Dink,” 
she asked him, “were you ever 
in the Army?” 

“You might say I’m still in 
an army,” he said, turning and 
smiling down at her from that 
arrogant posture of his. “I’m 
a corporal in the army of the 
gainfully employed; an army 
where there’s little glamor but 
better pay than in the parades- 
and-battles sort. What makes 
you ask, Orison?” 

“Because of the way you 
stand and walk, Dink,” she 
said. “Like an Infantry cap- 
tain from Texas.” 

“I’m flattered.” Dink Gerd- 
ing said, holding oDen the 
lobby door for her. “The car’s 
just around the corner.” 

“I met your brother, Kraft, 
earlier today, just before he 
and the Earmuffs caught me 
up on eighth floor,” Orison 
said. “He's no Texan, that one. 
A Junker, maybe. I’m afraid 
I don’t much care for your 
brother. Dink.” 

“To be my elder brother is

Kraft’s special misfortune,” 
Dink said. “I understand he 
was quite loveable as a boy. 
Here’s our transportation.” 

The car was a Rolls-Royce 
Silver Wraith, splendidly con- 
spicuous beside the curb of the 
Windsor Arms, reducing that 
nobly-named establishment by 
contrast to more democratic 
proportions. The ubiquitous 
Mr. Wanji, liveried in a uni- 
form nearly as ornate as the 
one Orison had visualized for 
Dink, only his earmuffs clash- 
ing with the magnificence of 
his costume, sprang from the 
driver’s seat, raced around the 
limousine and' stood at atten- 
tion holding the door for Ori- 
son and her escort. The front 
door of the Rolls was marked, 
she observed, with a gold de- 
vice of three coronets. At the 
center of the triangle they 
formed was the single letter 
“D.” 

The Rolls negotiated the 
city streets with the dignity of 
the Queen Elizabeth entering 
a minor harbor. “I thought 
you bankers aspired to the 
common touch,” Orison re- 
marked. “I expected you to 
come for me in a taxi, or per- 
haps a year-old Ford you 
drove yourself.” 

“Wanji is a better driver 
than I. So I have him drive 
me,” Dink explained. “We 
each do the work we’re trained 
for. I assist Wanji in balanc- 
ing his checkbook, for exam- 
ple. As for this car, it belongs 
not to me, but to my family. 

CINDERELLA STORY 



My family owns most of the 
toys 1 play with.” He paused. 
“I’ve been thinking, Orison, of 
acquiring a most valuable 
property for myself alone.” 

“A nice little seventy-meter 
yacht?” Orison inquired. “Or 
the island of Majorca, per- 
haps?” 

“Something even grander,” 
Dink said. “You, Miss Mc- 
Call.” 

“But, Dink!” 

The Rolls glided to the curb. 
Wanji jumped out and 
snapped open the door. “Sire!” 
he said, and saluted as Dink 
disbarked. Orison took Dink’s 
hand and stepped to the curb, 
acknowledging Wanji’s bow to 
her with a princess smile. 
She’d come a long way from 
the secretarial pool. 

T HE doorman of the restau- 
rant, instructed as to the 
importance of these clients by 
their tableau at the curb, ush- 
ered Dink Gerding and Orison 
McCall into the presence of 
the maitre d’. When the door- 
man had been rewarded with 
a crackling handshake, the 
headwaiter led them through 
the crowd of groundlings as 
though they were accompanied 
by fife and drums. The table 
to which he bowed them, while 
not the most conspicuous, was 
without doubt the finest the 
management had to offer. The 
Reserved sign was swept aside 
with a gesture that indicated 
that there were no reserva- 
tions where Mr. Dink Gerding 

103 




was concerned. Mr. Gerding 
justified the maitre’s confi- 
dence in him with another 
green-palmed handshake. 

“Dink,” Orison whispered 
across the table. “That was a 
fifty-dollar bill you gave him.” 

“Yes, it was,” Dink ad- 
mitted. “I felt that fifty was 
enough.” 

“Quite enough,” Orison as- 
sured him. 

The wine-steward, wearing 
a chain that could have held a 
tub to mooring, absorbed 
Dink’s instructions with the 
air of a chela attending the 
dying words of his guru. The 
two waiters poised themselves 
reverently at his shoulders, 
waiting the revelation of his 
order. “We’ll begin . .” Dink 
began. 

“Dink, I’d like a lobster,” 
Orison said. 

“I’d not advise lobster,” 
Dink said thoughtfully. “I’m 
afraid that lobster won’t agree 
with you this evening.” 

“Dink, lobster is what I 
want,” Orison insisted. 
“Haven’t you heard of the 
Nineteenth Amendment?” 

“Very well, feminist,” Dink 
said. He turned to the waiter 
at his right. “The lady wiil 
have a lobster.” He turned to 
the left. “As for me, a saddle 
of venison, and such accessory 
furniture as you may choose 
to accompany it.” The waiters 
bowed and retreated. 

“Why do you insist on be- 
ing boss, even after banking- 
hours?” Orison asked. 



“Being boss is not my na- 
ture, but is my training,” Dink 
said. “It seems to me, Orison, 
that you American women re- 
sent the dignity of being serv- 
ed by an adoring man.” 

“I prefer dignities to be 
more democratic,” she said. 
“Why, in any case, should you 
be exercised by my choosing 
lobster for dinner? My diges- 
tion is my own affair, isn’t it?” 

WV7'OUR question,” Dink 
J- said, resting his elbows 
on the table, “requires a two- 
part answer. Imprimus : ev- 
erything you do interests me, 
Orison, inasmuch as you are 
my future bride. Please make 
no comment at this point. Al- 
low me to enjoy for the mo- 
ment the male privilege of 
unimpeded speech. Secundus: 
I once wished to be a doctor, 
had not my career been chosen 
by my father. I still pursue 
the study of medicine as a hob- 
by. I didn’t wish you to order 
lobster because I’m certain 
that you’ll be unable to enjoy 
lobster.” 

“I’ve eaten it before,” Ori- 
son said. “Except for the en- 
gineering difficulties in getting 
through the shell with all those 
little picks and nutcrackers 
and nail-clippers, I had no 
trouble to speak of. Dink, are 
you a foreigner?” 

“What makes you think I 
may be?” he asked. 

“The crest of your car, the 
earmuffs on most your staff at 
the Bank and the fact that 



104 



ALLEN KIM LANG 




you seem to think a woman’s 
opinion nothing more than a 
trifle. There’s a beginning,” 
Orison said. 

“What’s wrong with ear- 
muffs?” Dink demanded. “Ev- 
erybody wears ear-muffs.” 

“Not everybody,” Orison 
said. “Not in April. Not bank 
officials. Not indoors, in any 
case.” 

“Must report this to the 
Board,” Dink said, taking a 
notebook from his pocket and 
scribbling. “Must find alterna- 
tive. No earmuffs indoors.” 
Perfect, Orison thought, near 
tears." He’s perfect. He’d sit 
astride that milk-white charg- 
er like a round-table knight, 
sturdy and lean and honest- 
eyed. Dink is perfect, she 
thought, except only that he’s 
insane. 

Dink tucked his notebook 
back into his vest-pocket. “If 
I were a foreigner,” he asked, 
“would it make any difference 
to you?” 

“Your nationality should con- 
cern me as little as my diet 
concerns you,” Orison said. 

“You said should,” Dink 
pointed out. “That means that 
you are concerned with me. 
Therefore, I will formally in- 
vite you to marry me.” He held 
up his hand as Orison began 
to speak. “I warn you, Orison, 
there are only two answers 
.possible to my proposal. Only 
Yes or Some day.” 

“What if I said no?” Orison 
asked. 

“I'd interpret it as Some 

CINDERELLA STORY 



day,” he said, and smiled. 

“You know nothing about 
me,” Orison protested. 

“But I do,” Dink said. “I 
know you’re good. I know that 
you’ve fallen half in love with 
me, and I entirely in love with 
you, in this half-day in April 
that we’ve known each other.” 

“No,” Orison said, gripping 
tightly the edge of the table. 

“That means. Some day,” 
he said. 

The lobster arrived in post- 
mortem splendor, borne on a 
silver tray, brick-red, garnish- 
ed with sprigs of parsley and 
geranium, served with the sil- 
ver instruments designed for 
his dissection and the bowl of 
baptismal butter, “ph . .” 
Orison said, turning her eyes 
away from the supper she’d 
selected. “It’s horrible!” 

“You’ve no appetite for lob- 
ster?” Dink asked. 

“I’d as soon eat boiled baby,” 
Orison said, pressing her nap- 
kin against her lips. 

“Take it away,” Dink in- 
structed the waiter. “The lady 
will have the same order as 
I.” The crustacean, red but 
undismembered, was again 
borne aloft by the waiter to 
be returned to the scene of his 
martyrdom. “Try a little of 
the wine, Orison,” Dink sug- 
gested, tipping a splash of the 
Riesling into her glass. “It will 
clear your head.” 

S HE sipped. “It helps,” she 
admitted. “What do you 
suppose happened tome, Dink? 

105 




It’s as though all of a sudden 
I’d become allergic to lobster.” 
“In a sense you are, dar- 
ling,” Dink said. 

“Such a strange thing,” she 
said. ' 

“Don’t let these strange 
things worry you, Orison,” 
Dink said. “Think this: for 
everything in the universe, 
there’s an explanation. If you 
understand it or not, the ex- 
planation’s still there, curled 
up in the middle of the mys- 
tery like Pinocchio in the belly 
of his whale. Just have faith 
in the essential honesty of the 
universe, Orison, and you’ll be 
all right.” 

“A comforting philosophy,” 
Orison said. “I can’t imagine 
an explanation for my sudden 
distaste for lobster, though.” 
“Such things happen,” Dink 
assured her. “I have a friend, 
for instance, who holds life in 
such reverence that he eats 
only vegetables. Isn’t that 
strange? And he worries, this 
very good friend of mine, that 
■perhaps vegetables have souls, 
too; and that perhaps it is no 
more moral to destroy them 
for his food than it is to roast 
and ingest his fellow animals.” 
“So what does this friend 
of yours eat?” Orison asked. 

“Vegetables,” Dink said. 
“But he worries about it. He’s 
how proposing to confine his 
diet to cakes made from algae. 
His argument is that if vege- 
tables have souls, algae have 
very small souls indeed; and 
that they suffer less in being 

106 



eaten than would, say, a cab- 
bage or an apple. His guilt 
may be numerically greater, 
eating algae. But it will be 
qualitatively less.” 

“Has this micro-vegetarian 
friend of yours thought of 
psychotherapy?” Orison ask- 
ed. 

“Often,” Dink said. “But he 
maintains that he’s much too 
old to pour out his mind to a 
stranger; too set in his pat- 
terns to change. He fears most 
of all, he says, that he might 
be made uncomfortable in new 
ways.” 

“We all do,” mused Orison. 

“Do I make you uncomfor- 
table in a new way?” Dink 
asked. 

“You’re strange,” Orison 
said. “Your Bank is fantastic. 
All in all, this is the most pe- 
culiar day I’ve ever lived.” 

“I promise you, Orison, that 
someday you’ll understand 
why the sight of lobster made 
you ill this evening, why so 
many of the people at the 
Bank wear earmuffs, why I 
seem foreign. You’ll under- 
stand the work of the singing 
Microfabridae and you’ll meet 
Elder Compassion ; you’ll know 
why Wanji was excited about 
the escudo green; and some- 
day soon, this most of all I 
promise you, you’ll love me, 
and be my wife. Hah! Here 
are the comestibles. Let’s talk 
of topics less vital than love 
and earmuffs. Let’s talk of the 
weather, and Mr. Kennedy, 
and the orchestra.”

“J-12: Is the job wearing 
you down? 

“Miss McCall: It’s exciting 
and mysterious. Nothing like 
Washington. The boss of Taft 
Bank appears to be a man 
named Dink Gerding. He’s six 
feet tall and slim, his hair is 
clipped short as a dachshund’s, 
and he walks like an Olympic 
skier. The other men at the 
bank bow when they meet him, 
and some of them get all the 
way down onto the floor when 
he’s angry. Do you suppose 
this means something? 

“J-12 : Everything means 
something. 

“Miss McCall: He said that. 
Dink did. For everything in 
the universe, he said, there’s 
an explanation. 

“J-12: Not so. I mean that 
everything that people do in 
banks is explainable. Not all 
the universe is logical — the 
tax-structure, for instance, or 
the ways of women.

some members of the Taft

he wants details of what goes

better. Over. 

“Miss McCall: Roger, Wil-

“She whispered to her pil- 
low, local time 2 A.M., ‘I love 
him. 1 ” 

O RISON hadn’t gone to 
sleep easily. She’d sup- 
pressed information from J- 
12, saying nothing to him 
about tile Microfabridae, sure- 
ly the most striking objective 
discovery of her two days’ 
spying within the Taft Bank. 
More central in her thoughts 
than her disloyalty to the 
Treasury Department, though, 
was Dink Gerding. He’d told 
her that she was half in love 
with him. He was half wrong, 
she thought. “I love him en- 
tirely,” she whispered, not 
knowing that J-12 — in care- 
lessness, not subterfuge — had 
left the receiver-switch open 
to the pillow she’d made her 
confidante. 

The Wall Street Journal 
greeted her the next morning, 
curled up in her “In” basket. 
She’d just switched on her 
microphone and said “Good 
morning” to her invisible lis- 
tener when Mr. Wanji stepped 
from the elevator. His ears, 
she saw, were bare today. But 

108 



they were pink — a shocking, 
porcelain, opaque, Toby-mug 
shade of pink. 

She looked away from this 
latest manifestation of peculi- 
arity in banker’s ears. “Good 
morning, Mr. Wanji,” she 
said. 

“Hi, doll,” Wanji said. “The 
brain-guy says you don’t have 
to read out loud any more. Just 
read quiet-like. Dig?” 

“Yes, sir,” she said. “Shall 
I take notes on anything in 
particular?” 

“Naw,” Wanji. said. “The 
brain-guy, he remembers ev- 
erything.” 

“The brain-guy?” Orison 
asked. “Is that Dink Gerding?” 

“Naw. Dink’s the boss. The 
brain-guy is the man who 
makes the wheels go round,” 
Wanji said. He pressed the 
“Up” button of the elevator. 
As Wanji embarked, Orison 
observed that the elevator op- 
erator had the same shocking- 
pink ears. 

Had those earmuffs been de- 
signed to hide this pinkness, 
the symptom of some rare and 
disfiguring disease? Orison re- 
turned to her newspaper, read- 
ing silently as ordered, won- 
dering what obscure Pinocchio 
of sense was curled up in the 
belly of 'this whale of illogic. 
The elevator, she noticed with 
the housekeeping bit of her 
mind, was running much more 
than usual today, up and down 
like a spastic yo-yo. Whatever 
the mysterious business of the 
William Howard Taft Nation- 



ALLEN KIM LANG 




al Bank and Trust Company 
might be, there was a lot of it 
being done. 

Her telephone buzzed. Ori- 
son switched off her micro- 
phone. “Miss McCall here,” 
she said, feeling very efficient 
and British. 

“This is Mr. Kraft Gerd- 
ing,” she was told. “I need you 
at the National Guard Armory 
right away, Miss McCall. Will 
you come right over?” 

“Yes, sir,” Orison said. She 
gathered up her purse and 
coat and pressed the elevator 
button. The operator ushered 
her into his car as though she 
were his queen, and the ele- 
vator the paramount plane of 
the royal flight. Standing be- 
hind him as he piloted them 
downward five floors, Orison 
studied the man’s ears. They 
were that awful, artificial 
pink, as though enameled. Pan- 
cake makeup? Orison wonder- 
ed. The ears, now the earmuffs 
were off, might be the clue to 
that fish-of-understanding she 
sought. Orison dampened a 
fingertip and applied it to the 
edge of the man’s ear. 

He turned and stared. “A 
fly,” Orison explained. “I 
brushed it off.” 

“Oh. Thank you. Here’s the 
street floor. Miss McCall.” 

“Thank you.” Orison step- 
ped from the lobby to Broad- 
way, refusing to examine her 
fingertip until she was well be- 
yond the shadow of the Taft 
Bank Building. Now she look- 
ed at it. 



A sort of pink paint was 
showing there. And where 
she’d touched the elevator op- 
erator’s ear to remove the 
makeup, the flesh beneath had 
shown a brilliant, eggplant 
purple. 

O RISON was greeted at the 
National Guard Armory 
by Auga Vingt, mistress of 
malice. “How lovely of you to 
come right over, darling,” she 
said. “Kraft is waiting for you 
in the office of Company C.” 
“Thank you, darling,” Ori- 
son purred. She clutched her 
purse as she walked up the 
indicated stairway, Miss Vingt 
behind her. 

Kraft Gerding was in full 
uniform behind a desk marked 
“Commanding Officer,” but his 
was not the uniform of the 
U.S. Army. It was the sort 
that Mr. Wanji had worn as 
Dink’s chauffeur, its splendor 
squared. “Good morning, Miss 
McCall,” Kraft Gerding said, 
standing. “I’m so happy you 
could come. We need you here.” 
“What am I to do, sir?” 
Orison asked. 

“Your presence is the full 
extent of your services requir- 
ed, my dear,” he said. “You 
see, you’re my hostage. My 
brother’s interest in your wel- 
fare is so marked that I de- 
termined to seize you as col- 
lateral for his cooperation. 
We’ve begun a revolution, Miss 
McCall. You’ll stay with us 
until victory. Colonel the Mar- 
gravine Auga Vingt, Comman- 

109 



CINDERELLA STORY 




der of the Royal Refreshment 
Corps, will act as your host- 
ess. Colonel, please take Miss 
McCall to her quarters.” 
“Now look here, bud !” Ori- 
son said. 

“The proper address to Mr. 
Gerding is ‘Your Royal High- 
ness,' darling,” Miss Vingt 
said, accompanying her point 
of protocol with a jab at the 
small of Orison’s back. “Come 
along, darling.” 

“I’m not going anywhere 
until I’ve telephoned Dink,” 
Orison said. 

“Terribly sorry,” said Col- 
onel Auga Vingt. “Our tele- 
phone has just gone' out of 
order.” Two bravos wearing 
U.S. Army fatigues — surely 
the largest such uniforms ever 
sewn together — stepped into 
the room. They were enor- 
mous men, menacing, purple 
of ear. “Will you walk along 
like a good girl, or shall I have 
my pets carry you?” the odi- 
ous Auga asked. 

“I’ll walk,” Orison decided. 
“What’s more, I’ll sue.” 

“All in good time, darling,” 
Auga Vingt said. 

O RISON’S cell was large 
enough to be a ballroom, 
comprising as it did the entire 
basement of the armory. A cot 
had been unfolded in one cor- 
ner, next to a parked half- 
track, and three olive-drab 
blankets were stacked upon 
it. “Home, darling,” Colonel 
Vingt said. 

“I hope you realize that kid- 

110 



napping is a Federal offense,” 
Orison said. 

“So is seizing an armory,” 
her warden explained. “Of 
course, the U.S. Army doesn’t 
realize we’ve got it, yet. They 
drill here only on Mondays.” 
She turned and spoke quickly 
to the two guards, using what 
was apparently the same lan- 
guage Wanji had employed 
over the telephone. The guards 
bowed, then each chose a ve- 
hicle for his guard-post. One 
seated himself behind the 
wheel of a weapons-carrier, 
the other posting himself, 
cross-legged, on the steel hatch 
of a Sherman tank. 

Auga Vingt turned to leave. 
“Hey,” Orison said. “You’re 
not going to abandon me here 
with these two gorillas.” 

“But, darling, I am!” the 
obnoxious Auga replied. “If 
you’re worried ah ~>ut your vir- 
tue, rest easy, lamb. I can as- 
sure you that my thugs are 
safe as kittens, providing only 
that you make no attempt to 
escape. They are required, you 
see, to confine their romantic 
aspirations to members of the 
Royal Refreshment Corps of 
appropriate rank. Since they 
speak no English, nor any 
other tongue you’re likely to 
have heard of, they won’t be 
much company. But they will 
be loyal in their attendance.” 

“Let me out of here !” a 
man’s voice shouted, the sound 
echoing among the ranks of 
tanks, half-tracks, weapons- 
carriers, and jeeps. 

ALLEN KIM LANG 




“Who’s that?” Orison de- 
manded. 

“Your fellow-prisoner,” Au- 
ga explained. “Until quite re- 
cently, he was Commanding 
Officer of C Company. Your 
keepers have strict orders not 
to let you two speak to one 
another. But I must get on 
with my duties, charming as 
I find your company. Good 
day, darling.” 

“Drop dead,” Orison sug- 
gested. 

A FTER the door had slam- 
med behind Auga Vingt, 
and the key had chattered in 
its lock, she sat at the edge 
of her cot. The two guards 
watched her as casually as 
though she were just another 
item on the Motor Company's 
T.O.&E. This is what she got 
for playing it coy with Wash- 
ington, Orison thought. If 
she’d clued J-12 in on the 
Microfabridae, she’d at least 
have been given some techni- 
cal help. Then someone might 
have been there to blow the 
whistle when she disappeared 
from the Taft Bank Building. 
As things stood now, no one 
would know of her abduction 
until her pillow called tonight 
at eleven-fifteen and got no 
answer: A long time off, she 
thought. Perhaps she could 
get some help from the im- 
prisoned commander of C 
Company, she thought. Orison 
stood and called out, “Hey, 
there! Can you hear . 

A large palm suddenly clos- 

CINDERELLA STORY 



ed over her mouth. The guard 
who’d been seated atop the 
tank had sprung down and ap- 
peared beside her as suddenly 
as a circus trick. Experimen- 
tally, he removed his hand 
from her mouth. “. me?” 
Orison completed her query, 
and was shut off again. 

“Five by five,” the male 
voice answered. “Who are . .” 
The other guard was gone 
now, and presumably stood be- 
side the captain as his fellow 
stood beside Orison. There was 
silence for five minutes, Ori- 
son having trouble breathing, 
struggling until it became ap- 
parent that no action of hers 
would have the slightest effect 
on the mountainous bulk of 
her muffler. Then he removed 
his hand. Orison, out of 
breath, her lesson learned, 
stayed quiet. The guards re- 
sumed their seats aboard the 
rolling-stock. 

There must be another way 
to signal her fellow-prisoner. 
Orison thought. Tapping? She 
clicked an S-O-S on the side 
of a jeep with her pen. Her 
guard appeared beside her as 
quickly as before, and took the 
pen to stick it in his pocket. 
She was, it appeared, effec- 
tively in solitary confinement. 

Orison stood up to see if the 
guard minded. Apparently not. 
She walked about the huge 
basement. She’d never before 
seen so much military hard- 
ware outside an Armed Forces 
Day parade. Impressive, all 
this steel. A ramp led up to a 

111 




door the size of a barn-side, 
also steel, bolted. If she could 
get inside a tank, and close 
the hatch, and somehow get 
the monster up that ramp to 
ram that door, she’d make an 
impressive call for help, Ori- 
son thought. She put one foot 
atop a tank-tread when a large 
arm reached around her and 
set her aside. Her guard, si- 
lent-footed, had been follow- 
ing all through her tour. 

Orison returned to her cot. 

Great deal, she thought. 
From desk to dungeon in an 
hour and a half. She’d battled 
with shadows, earmuffed shad- 
ows, and had got herself set 
in an amateur jail guarded by 
a pair of purple-eared apes. 
Nothing to do but wait. 

Four feet crashed onto con- 
crete, two figures bowed till 
the palms of their hands 
brushed the floor. “T’ink,” the 
newcomer said. The two 
guards backed to their vehicles 
and resumed their seats. 

“Orison, my dear!” It was 
Kraft Gerding, all unction and 
teeth, advancing upon her like 
the loser at tennis, hand out- 
stretched. “I hope you haven’t 
been unduly discommoded,” 
he said. 

66T HAVEN’T been commod- 

-I- ed at all,” Orison said. 
“No one showed me the way. 
Would you mind explaining 
this chivaree to me, Mr. Ger- 
ding?” 

“I’d be delighted to explain, 
my dear,” Kraft Gerding said, 

112 



bowing. “May I sit?” he ask- 
ed, waving a hand toward her 
cot. 

“You may fall on your 
dreadful face, for all I care,” 
Orison said. 

“You must learn to speak 
like a queen,” Kraft said, seat- 
ing himself on the cot beside 
her. “Otherwise, of course, 
you are perfect.” 

“Of course,” Orison said. 
“I can’t say the same for you.” 

“I grow on one,” Kraft said. 
“You wonder, no doubt, how 
the William Howard Taft Na- 
tional Bank and Trust Com- 
pany became a battleground; 
why many of our employees 
have ears the color of day-old 
bruises; why Wanji was so 
exercised by the color of escu- 
does; and what the work is 
that the Microfabridae sing 
at. No?” 

“Yes,” Orison said. 

“May I smoke?” Kraft Ger- 
ding asked, bringing a cheroot 
from an inner pocket of his 
fieldmarshal’s uniform. 

“Smoke, glow, burst into 
flame. It’s all the same to me,” 
Orison said. 

Kraft Gerding lit his che- 
root with the air of an acolyte 
igniting incense. Then, puf- 
fing, “Accident,” he said, “has 
made you privy to a coup 
d’etat. Our Empire, you see, is 
based on porphyrogeniture. 
Thus my brother, Dink, is the 
Heir Apparent. I, his elder 
brother, conceived before our 
father became Emperor, am 
merely Margrave of the North, 

ALLEN KIM LANG 




Prince Royal of the House of 
Dink, Colonel-General of the 
Forces of the Triple Crown, 
Grand Duke of the Zilf Archi- 
pelago and Holder of the Keys 
to the Royal City of Chilif.” 

“How unassuming can you 
get?” Orison asked. 

“Your un-knowledge is 
deeper than I bethought me,” 
Kraft Gerding said, smiling, 
scooting a little wester on the 
cot. Orison moved one hips- 
breadth further to the west. 

“Very well,” Kraft said. “As 
a primer, thus: my brother 
Dink ger-Dink, heir through 
accident of tradition to the 
Triple Crown of Empire; I, 
his elder, better brother; and 
our officers and exiles — these 
latter common criminals, 
marked for men’s contempt 
with purple ears — constitute 
the XLIIth Subversion-and- 
Conquest Task Force of the 
Empire of Dink. This mighty 
Empire, for your information, 
lies some distance off in the 
southern skies of Earth.” 

“How far off?” Orison 

“As far,” Kraft Gerding 
said, “as all your men since 
Adam have run in pursuit of 
beauty.” He scooted further 
west. 

Orison made still further 
westering. “You come from 
some foreign planet?” she 
asked. 

“No longer foreign, my 
dear,” Kraft said. “Our plan- 
et, our triple footstool, wel- 
comes young Earth to share 

CINDERELLA STORY 



our ancient wisdom and relax 
under the shadow of our 
might.’ r 

“And I, young Earth, tell 
you, Kraft Gerding, to go sail 
a saucer,” Orison said. 

RAFT GERDING stood 
up. “Come with me, my 
dear. I’ll show you the green- 
ery that establishes me as Em- 
peror Apparent of the planet 
Earth.” He strode to a steel 
door, took a key from his pock- 
et, and unlocked it. “Behold!” 
he said, flinging the door open. 

Orison stepped into the 
basement room, a cube some 
fifty feet in each dimension. 
She found herself in a corri- 
dor between huge walls of 
bundled paper. Kraft Gerding, 
behind her, pried a packet 
from the wall and handed it to 
her. “This, my dear Orison, is 
the lever with which I’ll over- 
turn the Earth,” he said. 

The bundle was banded with 
a strip of paper bearing the 
legend, “$5,000 in 50’s.” Each 
bit of paper in the bundle bore 
the portrait of President U. S. 
Grant. “This room,” Kraft 
Gerding said, “contains some 
four hundred million dollars 
in U.S. currency. I intend with 
this money, and as much more 
as I need, to subvert and pur- 
chase a nation. The United 
States will then be the beach- 
head for the world.” 

“Counterfeits,” Orison said. 

“But perfect counterfeits,” 
Kraft said. “The paper was 
manufactured by the master- 

113 





craftsmen of Chilif. The inks 
were compounded by the chem- 
ists of that same capital city 
of Empire. The plates were cut 
by twenty million engravers, 
the Microfabridae of the 
Storm-Planet, supervised by 
Elder Compassion, an ancient 
of the slothful race that in- 
habits the planet nearest our 
mother sun. This is but one of 
my treasuries. I have many 
such. There is the Threadneed- 
le Room, filled with pounds- 
sterling, in ones, fives, fifties 
and hundreds. There are other 
rooms, boxes, trunks and 
trucks filled with all the cur- 
rencies of Earth. I am ready 
now to purchase this planet 
from its owners. No violence, 
you see. Just subterfuge.” 

“It’s violence enough, to 
ruin a planet,” Orison said. 

"It beats war,” Kraft Ger- 
ding said, drawing on his che- 
root. 

“And that disgusting Miss 
Vingt?” Orison asked. “What 
does she do in your forces of 
subversion?” 

■'“Colonel the Margrave 
Auga Vingt is commander of 
the Royal Refreshment 
Corps,” Kraft said. “You un- 
derstand that it wouldn’t do to 
allow our men, the purple- 
eared scum of three planets, to 
live off the land in the delicate 
matter of women. Colonel 
Vingt’s Corps both maintains 
morale and prevents incidents 
of fraternization that Earth- 
men might deplore with their 
fists and guns.” Kraft chuck- 

114 



led. “You’ll be amused to hear 
that Auga Vingt has an am- 
bition to become my Empress, 
once I have overthrown my 
brother’s tyranny and taken 
over Earth.” 

“I must sit down,” Orison 
said. 

“By all means, my dear,” 
Kraft said. He tipped over a 
stack of bundled twenty-dollar 
bills as a hassock for her com- 
fort. 

Wi^OULD I have a cigar- 
v4 ette?” Orison asked. 
“Do.” Kraft Gerding re- 
moved a pack from his pocket 
and lighted it for her, passing 
it from his lips to hers. Orison, 
hiding her feelings of distaste 
for this intimacy, drew on the 
cigarette. “Perhaps I might 
have a drink as well?” she 
asked. “All this is making me 
rather dizzy.” 

“It is dizzy-making,’'’ Kraft 
conceded. “In an instant, my 
pet.” He strode from the 
treasure-room, shouting in his 
native language to the guards. 

Orison tugged a twenty- 
dollar bill from one of the 
bundles on which she’d been 
sitting and held it to the tip 
of her cigarette, drawing to 
make it hot. The paper glowed, 
but the tiny patch of fire died 
out almost at once. She fum- 
bled in her purse. There it 
was— her bottle of nail-polish 
remover. She splashed the aro- 
matic fluid over the bundled 
money and again touched her 
cigarette to it. The paper 

ALLEN KIM LANG 




flared. Flames ran in upstream 
rivers through the stacks 
above. 

Orison ran to the nearest 
jeep and turned the key. The 
gears were unfamiliar to her, 
but she mastered them suffi- 
biently to get moving forward 
toward the steel doors. Up the 
ramp she rolled, her feet 
braced down hard on the ac- 
celerator, wedged into her 
seat. The jeep struck the steel 
doors and bounced back the 
ramp to the sound of a giant 
Chinese gong, its engine 
stalled. Groggy, Orison dis- 
mounted and ran to the door. 
She pounded on the steel with 
both fists, shouting for help. 

An arm encircled Orison, 
and she heard behind her the 
door of the money-room slam 
shut. “The blaze will smolder 
itself out in a moment, my 
dear,” Kraft Gerding said. He 
spoke to the guard who held 
her, and she was released. “I 
doubt that you’ve destroyed 
more than a million dollars’ 
worth of your local paper 
with your prank,” he said. 
“Five minutes’ press-run. I’ve 
brought you a spot of brandy. 
I daresay you can use it. Arson 
is thirsty work.” 

He held out his hand. One 
of the purple-eared guards 
produced a silver tray with a 
decanter and . two balloon- 
glasses, poured them a quar- 
ter full and presented the 
glasses to his chief, bowing 
deeply. Kraft took one glass, 
giving the other to Orison. “A 



toast ?” he asked. “To the suc- 
cess of my rebellion. To our 
inevitable marriage. And to 
the health of our progeny, who 
are, my dear, to inherit the 
Earth. A shotgun toast,” he 
said. 

Orison dashed her brandy 
toward his face. Kraft turned, 
catching the shower against 
his left ear, where it trickled 
down to stain the braid of his 
epaulette. He glared and 
raised his hand in a most 
unchivalrous gesture, then 
stopped himself. One of the 
guards produced a silken cloth 
to blot him dry. 

“The word ‘shotgun’ was 
perhaps ill-chosen,” Kraft 
said. “The spirit you show, 
dear Orison, is a quality most 
appropriate to the future Em- 
press of Earth.” 

“Keep away from me,” Ori- 
son said. 

66/"kUR ceremony of betroth- 
v/ al is simple,” Kraft 
said. He put his sword-arm 
about her waist. “You need 
only hear me say the words, 
‘I, Rex-Imperator, take thee to 
wife,’ and then bow, in tire 
presence of witnesses of my 
choosing. You’ll be as noble 
as any princess conceived in 
the Purple Chamber, of the 
Palace of Chilif.” 

“I’d rather die than marry 
you,” Orison said. 

“You’ve established the 
parameters of the possible 
rather neatly, my dear,” Kraft 
Gerding said. “You will be- 

115 



CINDERELLA STORY 




come my wife, and Empress- 
Apparent of Earth, or you 
will shortly be the loveliest 
corpse on this fair planet. My 
will is heaven’s law, you un- 
derstand. My word carries the 
sanction of two suns, and my 
anger breeds massive destruc- 
tion. I ask of you your one 
slight person. In return, I 
offer to share with you my 
greatness. You will rule with 
me in the palace I have chosen 
— I forget its name, but it is 
presently used as the tomb of 
the lady who invented the 
brassiere — the Taj Mahal, 
that’s it. Perhaps we could re- 
name it. Answer quickly, now ; 
great deeds are deeds of im- 
pulse : marry me !” 

“You’re mad,” Orison said. 
“When a man has the power 
I have, he cannot be called a 
madman, for his mind shapes 
the world to his dreams. There 
is then, you see, no disorien- 
tation,” Kraft said. “You’ve 
had a good ten seconds now to 
decide. Shall I call my wed- 
ding-guests or my execution- 
er,?” 

“Dink will never let you 
marry me,” Orison said. 

“His suit has come so far as 
that?” Kraft said. “No matter. 
I’ll destroy him.” 

“Please leave me, Your Ex- 
cellency,” Orison said. “I need 
time to think.” 

“I am clay in your lovely 
hands,” Kraft said, bowing. 
“I grant your wish.” 

“If I might ask another 
boon, Your Excellency,” Ori- 

116 



son said, “I’d like to talk with 
Dink.” 

“And so you shall,” Kraft 
promised her. “Tomorrow, 
perhaps. With my brother in 
chains and you in the regalia 
of an Empress.” He bowed 
again, and left her. The door- 
lock clicked after him. The 
two huge guards closed in on 
either side of Orison and led 
her back to her cot. When she 
had seated herself, they with- 
drew to their perches on the 
Army vehicles. 

VII 

1 MIGHT as well have joined 
the Marine Corps instead 
of the Treasury Department, 
Orison thought, resting her 
fists on her knees. She had no 
weapons now, nothing to help 
her break out from this steel- 
shuttered cellar. What’s more, 
the only clear evidence she had 
of the crime these extrater- 
restrials were plotting was a 
single counterfeit twenty- 
dollar bill wadded up in her 
hand. It looked entirely genu- 
ine, she thought. It was per- 
haps too perfect for her pur- 
pose. It was quite possible that 
this bill could be established 
as a counterfeit only by the 
unlikely discovery of a genu- 
ine note with the same serial- 
number. The paper-makers 
arid chemists of Chilif, the en- 
graving millions of Micro- 
fabridae, had done their work 
too well. 

Suddenly, across Orison’s 
ALLEN KIM LANG 




field of- regard there danced 
dozens of brilliant, five- 
pointed stars — over the weap- 
ons-carriers and the tanks, the 
jeeps and the two lolling 
guards, the concrete floor and 
the steel doors. Orison rubbed 
the heels of her hands into her 
eyes, but the stars were still 
there. “Don’t worry,” someone 
said. “I painted the stars on 
the backs of your eyes only to 
get your attention.” The stars 
disappeared, and Orison heard 
again the music of the Micro- 
fabridae, a singing almost un- 

llPHTuhlp 

“Who’s that.?” Orison de- 
manded, her voice uncertain. 

“Don’t speak. You’ll fright- 
en the guards,” the mysterious 
voice said. “We have had long 
association, Orison. It was I 
who, so close in empathy with 
you, prevented your eating 
lobster, for example. Earth’s 
lobster is a distant relative of 
mine. I could not see you in- 
gest one without feeling deep 
qualms. And it is to me you 
have been reading, filling my 
mind with knowledge and 
amusement while I was en- 
gaged in the dull work of pro- 
jecting the images of currency 
to the Microfabridae at work 
at their printing-plates. I am 
known as Elder Compassion, 
and I am your friend.” 

“And Dink’s friend?” 

"His especially,” the voice 
said. “Our business right now 
is to help you escape. We must 
know exactly where you are, 
Orison.” 



“I’m in the basement of the 
National Guard Armory,” 
Orison said softly. “Where are 
you ?” 

“I’m on the ninth floor of 
the Bank building,” Elder 
Compassion said. “Yes, that 
means telepathy, of a weak 
and uncertain sort. I am not 
one of the true telepaths, those 
gold and mighty minds I can 
hear trumpeting in the night. 
I can but whisper, and eaves- 
drop a bit in minds that let 
me. And is the fact that I 
speak within your ear and lis- 
ten to the currents that make 
words within your mind so 
much more mysterious than 
your pillow that whispers?” 

ii'T'ELL me what to do,” 

A Orison said. 

“Look at the entrance of 
your basement,” Elder Com- 
passion said. Orison stared at 
the steel doors at the top of 
the ramp. “Yes, Dink. You’re 
in the right place.” The inner 
voice ceased for a moment; 
and into Orison’s mind flashed 
a picture of those doors seen 
from outside. An automobile 
was parked a dozen feet from 
the door. Dink’s car! Wanji 
was at the wheel and Dink, 
grandly uniformed, was be- 
side him. A pink, animate 
thread dipped down from the 
trunk of the Rolls and began 
working its way toward the 
steel doors. Microfabridae, 
Orison guessed. Then the pic- 
ture in her mind flicked off, 
and she was alone again. 



CINDERELLA STORY 



117 




She watched the doors at 
the top of the ramp. 

For ten minutes or so, there 
was nothing new to be seen. 
Then — a pinpoint of light, a 
tiny movement. “Look away,” 
Elder Compassion said within 
her. “We don’t want to make 
your guards suspicious.” 

From the corner of her eye 
Orison could see the thin pink 
line approaching the Sherman 
tank upon which one guard 
was sitting, at ease but alert. 
The line of Mierofabridae split 
into two columns, and one set 
out toward the second guard, 
seated in his weapons-carrier, 
facing the little room where 
C Company’s commanding offi- 
cer was imprisoned. 

Orison knotted her fists to 
keep from screaming, remind- 
ing herself that these creeping 
things weren’t spiders. She 
heard, faint at first, but grow- 
ing at the edge of her con- 
sciousness, the song of the 
Mierofabridae. The twin col- 
lumns were thicker now. It 
seemed impossible that the 
guards hadn't yet seen them. 
A living thread oozed up the 
side of the tank and busied it- 
self a moment at the guard's 
sulkies 

“What’s going on?” the cap- 
tain, Orison’s fellow-prisoner, 
shouted from his hidden cell. 

“Mmmmf,” the guard as- 
signed to the captain replied. 
Then he was entirely silent. 

Orison stood. Her own 
guard was strapped to the 
steel of his tank by a hundred 

118 



strands of Lilliputian thread. 
A thin net of the stuff, fine as 
angel-hair, covered his mouth. 
The second guard, in the 
weapons-carrier, was bound 
in the same manner. He stared 
at Orison and moved his jaw, 
but could say nothing. “They’ll 
not be injured,” Elder Com- 
passion told her. “It is impos- 
sible for me to allow a living 
being to be hurt. Now, go look 
at the man who just called 
out.” 

Orison went to the cell 
where the Captain was, avoid- 
ing as she walked the pools of 
Mierofabridae scattered about 
the floor. The man stood in a 
barred room, evidently de- 
signed as the toolroom of the 
motor-pool, his hands around 
the bars. “Good afternoon,” 
he said. “What’s going on 
here?” 

“We’re getting out,” Orison 
told him. 

64 A SK him if he can drive 

■ l \ a tank,” Elder Compas- 
sion whispered to Orison. 
“Those steel doors are too well 
built to be quickly opened by 
our little locksmiths.” 

“Can you drive a tank, Cap- 
tain?” Orison asked. 

“Miss, I piloted one of those 
M4E8 Sherman’s across Eur- 
ope sixteen years ago. I’ve still 
got the strength to pull a 
landrel. But you’ll have to get 
me out there to do it ; because 
there isn’t room in this cell.” 

“I’ll get you out,” Orison 
promised. 



ALLEN KIM LANG 




“You want the Microfabri- 
dae to chew through the lock?” 
the voice-in-her-head asked 
gently. 

“That’s what I had in 
mind,” Orison said. 

“I know,” Elder Compassion 
said. “Please look at the lock, 
so that I may direct our little 
friends to it.” 

Orison gazed at the lock. A 
line of Microfabridae snaked 
up the steel door-frame and 
entered the keyhole. From in- 
side the door came a chitter- 
ing sound, like a clock gone 
berserk. Then the Crustacea 
reformed and marched down 
the door to the floor. Orison 
pressed the door-catch. The 
eviscerated lock gave way. 

The captain stepped out to 
stare at the Microfabridae. 
“Miss,” he said, “you and I 
could make a fortune with a 
team of those trained termites. 
There isn’t a bank in the coun- 
try that could stand up against 
us.” 

“It’s been thought of,” Ori- 
son said. “Help me get this 
man down from the tank, 
please, and we’ll be on our 
way.” Between them they 
lifted the cocooned guard, 
wrapped like a larva in Micro- 
fabridaean silk, to the cot, the 
little workers snipping with 
their chelae the threads that 
had bound him to the steel. 

“Can you unlock the steel 
doors?” Orison asked. 

“I don’t have the key,” the 
Captain said. 

“Then we’ll have to go 
CINDERELLA STORY 



through them,” Orison said. 
“Can we do it?” 

“We’ve got thirty-five tons 
to roll up that ramp,” the cap- 
tain said. “If we can’t bust out 
with a punch like that, shame 
on us. Seems kind of rough on 
the taxpayers to bulldoze 
through that expensive door.” 
“If we don’t make it out of 
here, those taxpayers may find 
themselves paying their thirty 
per cent to someone less 
friendly than Uncle Sam,” 
Orison said. She clambered up 
the side of the tank and 
tugged at the hatch. 

“Let me,” said the captain. 
He opened the hatch and 
dropped inside. “You sit here 
to my right. We’re going out 
the hard way, and buttoned 
up.” He closed the hatch, then 
reached over his left shoulder 
to tug the master battery 
switch, squeezed together the 
twin butterfly switches on the 
panel and grabbed hold of the 
steering-landrels. “Hold on, 
Miss. We’re headed for sun- 
light.” 

T HE Sherman's thirty-five 
tons were rolling along at 
ten miles an hour when its 
bow met steel. Concrete splin- 
ters flew from the sides of the 
door, which crumpled as the 
tank fisted into its middle. The 
door broke free of its supports 
and slammed outside, forming 
a deckway over which the 
treads of the tank crunched. 
The captain killed the engine 
and opened the hatch. He 

119 




boosted Orison out, and fol- 
lowed her. 

“Orison! Over here!” Dink 
Gerding shoute d. Orison 
leaped from the tank and ran 
toward the Rolls-Royce. “Get 
down!” Dink shouted again. 
He ran to seize her, and threw 
her to the ground. “And stay 
down!” He was up, drawing 
his sword. There was a crash. 
A smear of lead appeared on 
the concrete beside Orison. 
Dink, bellowing rage, was run- 
ning down the ramp into the 
armory basement, his sword 
raised. 

Kraft Gerding stood at the 
head of his troops at the foot 
of the ramp. In hand he had 
an Army .45. He shouted to 
his men, a dozen purple-ears, 
dressed in fatigues, each as 
big and ugly as the two who’d 
been guarding Orison and the 
Captain. They strained for- 
ward to follow him — but fell 
like ten-pins, tripped up by 
strands of web knitted be- 
tween their ankles by fast- 
working Microfabridae. “Don’t 
stop him, Elder Cousin !” Dink 
shouted, his words evidently 
meant for the mysterious 
brain-guy, Elder Compassion, 
in the ninth floor of the Taft 
Bank Building. “This I must 
do,” Dink said. 

Kraft Gerding dropped the 
automatic and slicked his 
sword from its scabbard. The 
blade, Orison saw, rising to 
her feet, was by no means an 
ornament. It looked most 
naked and competent. Dink 



advanced upon his brother, 
each holding his sword at the 
ready like scorpions ready to 
do battle. “It would distress 
me to wound you, elder sib- 
ling,” Dink said. 

“Lese majesty or no, my 
liege,” Kraft shouted, “I in- 
tend to chop you to stew- 
meat!” Their blades met and 
clashed, the swordsmen taking 
the shock of their contact with 
skillful springing of their 
arms and shoulders. Behind 
the clash of steel, Orison heard 
a new sound, the scream of a 
siren. A second siren called 
out, and both grew louder. 
“The police!” Wanji shouted. 
“Stop it, Sires!” 

The captain stood beside 
Orison. “I’ve seen Hamlet 
played,” he said, “but the 
sword-fight was nowhere near 
so violent as this. Who are 
these two nuts, anyway?” 
“My fiance, and the man 
who, if he lives, will be my 
brother-in-law,” Orison said. 

“Excuse me,” the captain 
said. 

O RISON gripped the cap- 
tain’s arm and tried not 
to cry out at Dink’s danger. 
Kraft parried his brother’s 
blade, raising it high and to 
his right. Then he went in 
like a flash, hacking his edge 
down toward the juncture of 
shoulder and neck. Dink fell 
aside. Kraft’s sword bit con- 
crete. Dink flipped his sword 
in a jeweled arc, slamming 
Kraft’s blade from his hand 



120

to spin end-over-end through 
the air like a drum-majorette’s 
baton. Kraft’s sword slammed 
to the pavement. In an instant 
a pool of Microfabridae had 
covered it, binding the steel 
to the concrete with strands 
of their angel-hair. 

Dink advanced on his broth- 
er, backing him against the 
bulk of the Sherman tank. 

Kraft Gerding stood with 
his hands at his sides, his 
face composed in dignity, wait- 
ing for the coup de grace. 
“Bind the traitor, Elder Cous- 
in,” Dink said, addressing an 
ear not present. Microfabri- 
dae, obedient to the command 
they alone heard, rolled in 
little waves across the steel 
door and knit Kraft in a web 
from ankles to larynx. The 
police were very near now, 
their sirens dying as they 
slowed to halt. Dink sheathed 
his sword. “Wanji!” he call- 
ed. “Put him in the car. It is 
time that we withdraw.” Wan- 
ji ran up to the cocooned 
figure, saluted, and dumped 
Kraft Gerding across his 
shoulder like a giant spool of 
silk. The Microfabridae flowed 
to the Rolls and pooled them- 
selves somewhere in its trunk. 
“To the Bank, Wanji,” Dink 
ordered, seating himself be- 
side his driver. Orison sat in 
the back, next to the trussed- 
up Kraft. 

Police appeared, whistling 
and brandishing their revol- 
vers. One occupied himself 
with kicking at Kraft’s 

CINDERELLA STORY 



grounded sword, tied to the 
pavement by tendrils tougher 
than steel wire. Another 
guarded the ankle-bound pur- 
ple-ears, obviously unable to 
believe what he was seeing. 
“You in the car there, stop!” 
a police officer shouted. Wanji, 
erect and unheeding at the 
wheel, took the limousine a- 
round the corner of the ar- 
mory and down the street to- 
ward the Bank. 

“You’d have done better, 
brother, to have killed me,” 
Kraft Gerding said, strait- 
jacketed in silk. 

“Killing would seem appro- 
priate, although our Elder 
Cousin declares it unlawful,” 
Dink said over his shoulder. 
“Your crime is treason against 
the Triple Crown, attempted 
assassination of the Heir Ap- 
parent, mutiny and kidnap. 
What punishment would you 
mete out to an officer so tur- 
pitudinous, were you Defend- 
er of the Crowns?” 

“I would have him put to 
death in a manner befitting 
his station,” Kraft said. “I 
would not bind him like a 
sausage and pelt him with 
taunts.” 

“Perhaps you can gain a 
special dispensation from El- 
der Compassion, allowing me 
to grant you a properly noble 
death,” Dink said. “We’ll ask 
him, if you like.” 

T HE William Howard Taft 
National Bank and Trust 
Company was closed, the os- 

121 




tensible reason given by an 
easel set up in front of the 
glass doors of the front en- 
trance : “National Holiday : 
Birthday of Millard Fillmore.” 
One of the loyalist Purple- 
Ears materialized behind the 
glass as the Rolls rolled up to 
the curb, and unlocked the 
doors. 

Wanji and the guard car- 
ried Kraft Gerding between 
them into the bank-lobby, Dink 
relocking the doors behind 
them. A knot of spectators 
gathered on the sidewalk out- 
side, shading their eyes, ex- 
amining with much conversa- 
tion the sign, the purple-eared 
guard, the uniformed Wanji 
and Dink and the figure truss- 
ed up like a rolled carpet on 
the parquet floor. “I think this 
busts up your counterfeiting 
ring. Dink,” Orison said. 
“What now?” 

“That is, darling, precisely 
the question I want to ask our 
brain - trust, Elder Compas- 
sion,” Dink said. “He is both 
our leader and in a sense our 
warden, you see. He came 
with us to Earth to guarantee 
that we in no way violate the 
principle of reverence for life 
in our conquest of your plan- 
et.” 

The elevator appeared, pi- 
loted by another of the Purple- 
Ears. “Nine,” Dink snapped. 
Wanji and the guard towed 
the packaged Kraft aboard. 

The anteroom into which 
the elevator door opened on 

122 



ninth floor smelled of ozone 
and dryness. Faint music vi- 
brated the desert air. “Bach?” 
Orison asked. 

“Scarlatti,” Dink said. "His 
music consoles Elder Compas- 
sion for the violence of men. 
Here — you’ll need these.” 
He handed Orison a pair of 
almost opaque goggles, the 
sort that welders wear. “Come 
on,” he said, tugging Orison 
through a door. 

Even with the heavy gog- 
gles, the room beyond was 
brilliant beyond belief, a Sa- 
hara summer-solstice noon in 
brightness. The floor was cov- 
ered by tons of sand, duned 
up against the windows in 
waves that would have dis- 
heartened a camel. The music 
now was almost as oppressive 
as the heat and the light. 
Great booming gouts of sound 
came from every direction. 
Suddenly, as though respond- 
ing to Orison’s mental protest, 
the music stopped. The lights 
dimmed somewhat. 

“We have come, Elder Cous- 
in,” Dink announced to the 
sand. 

“I speak to the lovely wo- 
man,” an interior voice said 
to all of them. “Do not fear 
me, Orison, though I will seem 
to you a most hideous worm. 
My world nestles next its sun. 
I, made to fit a homeworld 
that would seem a Hell to you, 
could hardly be expected to 
conform to green Earth’s stan- 
dards of beauty. Reflect, Ori- 
son, that I wish you well.” 

ALLEN KIM LANG 




S OMETHNG dragged itself 
across a dune. “My God !” 
Orison whispered, gripping 
Dink’s right arm with both 
her hands. 

“Orison, this is my mentor 
and my dearest friend,” Dink 
said. “His name is Elder Com- 
passion. He is older than the 
language you speak. And he 
is, though housed in strange 
flesh, a Man of Good Will.” 
The thing that squatted a- 
cross the mid-room dune was 
twelve feet long from the tip 
of the arched scorpion-telson 
to the twin pincers that form- 
ed a chitinous mustache be- 
neath its mouth. It stared at 
her with a pair of compound 
eyes the size of hub-caps. “I’ll 
not weary you further with 
squeezing words into your 
minds,” the interior voice said. 
“Bring me the writing-boards, 
Son and Cousin.” 

“Cornet !” Dink snapped. 
“Bring scratchboards.” 

“Sire !” A young officer ran 
back to the anteroom and 
came back with a stack of 
blackened boards, one of which 
he set up in the sand before 
the monster, glancing nervous- 
ly over his shoulder at the 
lance-like tip that quivered in 
the air above him. “It is a 
fearsome thing, this killing- 
tool my body is equipped 
with,” the voice said, “and 
embarrassing. It is rather as 
though your good Gandhi had 
been forced to carry a sub- 
machine gun through life.” 
The cornet scrambled out of 



way through the sand, and the 
giant sting lowered itself to 
the scratchboard. 

The words he inscribed into 
the blackness were written in 
a delicate italic, hardly larger 
than human penmanship : “My 
son, she is lovely.” 

“It is gracious of you, Elder 
Cousin, to recognize beauty in 
a form so unlike your own 
species,” Dink said, bowing. 

There was a mental chuekle. 
“Her mind, you clod !” the 
monster sketched in the 
scratchboard. “Her lovely, 
lovely mind.” 

“I am pleased that you rati- 
fy my choice of wife, Elder 
Cousin,” Dink said. 

“She will assist you in the 
most difficult task ever a scion 
of the Triple Crown had to 
accomplish. Son and Cousin,” 
Elder Compassion wrote. “She 
will aid you in preparing the 
Golden Worlds to accept Coca- 
Cola.” 

“Your meaning, Elder Cous- 
in, is hidden from my poor 
understanding,” Dink said. 

“I mean this,” Elder Com- 
passion sketched on his 
scratchboard. “You came for 
conquest bearing with you the 
seeds of violence, and thus 
defeat. You came to subvert 
Earth by pandering to Earth’s 
greed. You were yourself, 
through the agent of your 
greedy brother, rendered im- 
potent. Violence has been done. 
We must now retreat, making 
such amends as we can. In the 
years that will soon be upon 

123 



CINDERELLA STORY 




us, Earth’s men will follow us 
to the Golden Worlds, where 
you, as Emperor, and Orison, 
Empress, will greet them.” 
“To the ship, then?” Dink 
asked. “What will we do with 
the rebels? With Kraft, my 
brother?” 

“They have earned the pay- 
ment of exile,” Elder Com- 
passion wrote. “We will leave 
them here.” 

D INK turned to the young 
officer. “Cornet, assist our 
Elder Cousin to the ship,” he 
ordered. He turned to two of 
the purple-ears. “Take Kraft 
to the vault,” he said. 

Orison spoke to the monster. 
“Sir,” she said, “you spoke of 
making amends for the dam- 
age you have done. You must 
first of all destroy the paper 
with which you’d hoped to 
ruin us.” 

“I’ll give those orders, Ori- 
son,” Dink said. 

“What will be done about 
the counterfeit money you’ve 
already spent, financing your 
subversion?” she asked. 

Elder Compassion was writ- 
ing on his board. “Three miles 
beneath this city lies a vein 



of gold,” he wrote. “The Mi- 
crofabridae are this minute 
plumbing the earth to reach 
it. We will leave full payment 
for our fiscal sins.” 

Dink took Orison’s hand. 
“You’ll come with us?” he 
asked. 

“I will, Dink.” 

“Then I, Rex - Imperator, 
Son of the Triple Crown, 
Prince Porphyrogenous of 
Empire, take you to wife,” 
he said. 

“If you’re sure this is quite 
legal,” Orison said, “I do.” 
“There are voices all about 
us,” Elder Compassion spoke 
in their minds. “The traitor, 
Kraft, is in the vault, bound 
and seated in the midst of 
wealth. We must go, or there 
will be more violence.” 

“The moment the Microfa- 
bridae have left their golden 
payment for our folly, Elder 
Cousin, guide them to the 
ship,” Dink said. “I long to 
show my Princess her do- 
minions.” 

“She is the first,” the voice 
spoke again. “The first of the 
irresistible conquerors from 
Earth.”

The 

Flying Tuskers 
Of K’niik-K’naak 

BY JACK SHARKEY 



1 HAVE trod many tangled 
jungles, explored the floors 
of ' innumerable oceans and 
braved death in so many 
forms that a man less magni- 
ficent than myself would have 
died of fright. But if there is 
one event that stands out in 
my perfect memory that can 
still raise a goosebump or two 
on my broad tanned shoulders, 
the event is when I went hunt- 
ing for the flying tuskers of 
K’niik-K’naak. There we were, 



THE FLYING TUSKERS OF K'NIIK-K'NAAK 




myself and my faithful old 
purple Andromedan guide, 
Mimp, out in the vast blue- 
white desert of Polaris III, 
looking for the flying tuskers. 

K’niik-K'naak, the region 
we trod, was much feared by 
the Polaris III natives. They 
were a superstitious bunch 
anyway, who panicked at the 
very thought of being tram- 
pled or gored, and never ven- 
tured into the region of the 
tuskers. I, a man of clear head 
and no nonsense, laughed at 
their primitive fancies. I set 
out nonetheless into the des- 
ert, with only the barest rudi- 
ments necessary for survival. 
We could get none of the local 
boys for bearers, so Mimp had 
to carry everything. Natural- 
ly I had to have both hands 
free to use my Moxley .55, the 
best ray-rifle you can buy any- 
where in the colonized uni- 
verse. 

Aside from the ray-rifle, I 
carried nothing save a four- 
teen-inch carbon-steel bolo 
knife slung to my belt, my 
ever-present calabash pipe, 
crammed full of steaming 
Yekkweed — expensive to have 
imported from the Martian 
canals, but I buy it by the car- 
ton — and my trusty f9-ulti- 
flex binoculars on a short plat- 
inum chain. 

Mimp struggled along be- 
hind me as we set off into the 
desert. Even his mighty plum- 
hued muscles quivered under 
the load of our gear, which in- 
cluded an inflatable pseudolog 

126 



hut (with fireplace, an option- 
al extra), a double-oven radi- 
um-powered cookout stove and 
a seven-pound crate of signal 
flares, just in case we got lost. 

T HREE days we ranged the 
shifting blue-white sands 
of K’niik-K’naak, watching 
everywhere for signs of the 
herd we’d heard occurred in 
that region. Nothing. 

“Keep sharp lookout,” I 
snapped at Mimp, over my 
shoulder. Mimp was like a 
brother, but you have to keep 
these aliens in their place. 

“Yes, Bwana,” said Mimp. 
(He called me Bwana, al- 
ways.) “Soon we come to 
waterhole.” 

I didn’t ask him how he 
knew. Andromedans have a 
knack for geography. In many 
ways, they’re almost as good 
as an Earthman. “Good,” was 
all I answered. It was short, 
to the point, and showed who 
was boss. 

Onward we trekked, a sun- 
burnt duo casting long bronze 
shadows across the burning 
sands of K’niik K’naak. A thin 
plume of Yekkwood fumes 
marked our passage. It was 
nearly sunset when we spotted 
the pink glitter of that sicken- 
ing slop that is the Polaris III 
excuse for water. I stood 
watching the sunset, while 
Mimp unloaded all the gear 
and began to set up camp. As 
the last rays faded in the sky, 
I turned and entered the pseu- 
dolog hut Mimp had inflated. 

JACK SHARKEY 




Hard on his lungs, of course, 
but I hadn’t wanted to burden 
him with the extra weight of 
a hand-pump. I’m a stern man, 
but I’m fair. 

He had my slippers laid out 
beside the armchair by the fire 
and a cool mint julep awaiting 
me on the small teakwood 
taboret. He was busying him- 
self in the kitchenette, whip- 
ping up a quick souffle with 
one hand and tossing a small 
salad with the other. 

“Hurry it up there,” I 
growled jovially. “Time is 
money, time is money!” A bit 
of friendly joshing is good for 
the relationship ; shows Mimp 
I’m tolerant of him sharing 
the same quarters, without 
actually making me act like an 
equal, if you know what I 
mean. 

“I hurry, Sahib,” said 
Mimp. “Coming up.” (He al- 
ways called me Sahib.) He 
rushed across the room and 
began setting the table, with 
my pearl-handled silverware. 

“No, not there,” I yawned, 
picking up my julep and set- 
tling back into the armchair. 
“I think I’d like the table 
nearer the piano, so you can 
play Chopin Nocturnes while 
I dine.” I added, as a kindly 
afterthought, “You can re- 
heat your share of the souffle 
later, after I’ve gone to bed.” 
Personally .*1 hate cold souffle. 

“Yes, Effendi,” said Mimp. 
(He always called me Effen- 
di.) Rapidly, he moved the 
table over to the Steinway, set 

THE FLYING TUSKERS OF K'NIIK-K' 



out the finished souffle and 
salad and then hurried to the 
piano and began laboriously 
plunking out glorious melody. 
I took a sip of my julep, then 
spat it out on the carpet. 

“Mimp !” I roared, incen- 
sed. “Did you make this drink 
with Polaris III water?” 
Craven and cowering, he 
fell at my feet, whining for 
mercy. But I was adamant. 
You let an alien take an inch, 
and the next thing, he’s 
swiped a parsec. “The knout,” 
I said, keeping my voice emo- 
tionless and holding out my 
hand. 

“Please, Kimosabe,” whim- 
pered Mimp, “I dared not use 
the water in the canteens. 
You know that Polaris III 
water is poisonous to us An- 
dromedans, while you Earth- 
men can tolerate it.” 

“I can not!” I raged. 

“I was speaking medically,” 
he mewed piteously. 

“And I, esthetically,” I 
snarled. “The knout, now, and 
be quick about it.” 

He scurried on all fours to 
the bureau where I kept my 
odds and ends, and came 
crawling back with the brutal 
leather whip. I weighed the 
infraction, decided that three 
stripes should be lessen 
enough and I laid them onto 
his bare back with a steady 
hand. “Now,” I said, wearied 
by the effort, “play something 
gay and lilting.” 

Hastily, he dragged himself 
to the Steinway and complied. 

NAAK 127 




Dinner was really delicious. 

N EXT morning, before sun- 
up, we lay in wait for the 
herd behind a rock beside the 
waterhole. The sky was grow- 
ing pale saffron near the hori- 
zon, then light yellow, and 
finally glaring brass as the 
sun arose. (By “sun,” I mean 
the star Polaris, of course. 
Our sun is a star, you know. 
Or did you? I knew, natur- 
ally.) Then, afar off, I espied 
the bulky blobs in the sky 
that were the flying tuskers 
of K’niik-K’naak. No man 
had ever hunted one before. I 
felt pretty proud, let me tell 
you. 

Onward they came through 
the air, their large skin-tvoe 
gray wings flapping stolidly 
up and down, about three 
strokes to the mile. Enormous 
creatures they were, with 
fiery little eyes, and long trail- 
ing trunks that had a wicked 
little hook at the tip. But the 
thing that really caught one’s 
eye was their tusks. Ten of 
them. Eight originating in the 
mouth, and one in either fore- 
knee. Each tusk was seven 
feet in length, long, white, 
straight-tapered and flawless. 
But not ivory, not on these 
babies. Pure pearl. That love- 
ly lustrous calcareous concre- 
tion! Each tusk would bring 
fifty thousand interplanetary 
credits on the open market. 
And there were ten per ele- 
phantine beast, and at least 
sixty of them in the herd. 

128 



“Look at that, will you!” I 
cried to Mimp. “Look, feast 
your ugly eyes on that gleam- 
ing fortune swooping down 
upon us, Mimp!” 

“I look, I feast,” he mur- 
mured servilely, huddled be- 
hind me behind the rock be- 
hind the tree. Aliens tend to 
be cowardly when their lives 
are in danger. 

Carefully, I raised the rifle 
and took a bead on the young- 
est beast in that descending 
herd. It’s slightly illegal to 
shoot the fledglings, but after 
all, I wasn’t going to bring 
him back with me, so no one 
would know. It’s just that I 
find that when I shoot the eld- 
est in a herd of wildlife, the 
others miss their protector 
and flee. But if I shoot one of 
the babies, the elder ones stay 
around to protect it, and I get 
to kill lots more. Nasty, per- 
haps, but that’s the hunting 
game for you. 

Anyhow, I took this bead on 
the beasts. I was just in the 
act of depressing the firing 
stud when an unwonted 
lightness in the weapon caught 
my attention. Irritated, I 
cracked open the firing cham- 
ber. “Mimp!” I growled, in 
one of my rare real wraths. 
“You didn’t load the ray-rifle ! 
Even a Moxley .55 is no 
damned good without cart- 
ridges !” 

“A thousand pardons, boss,” 
muttered Mimp, inclining his 
loathsome lavender face in a 
subservient 'bow. “I go get.” 

JACK SHARKEY 




He wriggled away across 
the sand and into the hut, for- 
tunately not disturbing the 
herd, which was now kneeling 
on the slope above the water- 
hole and inhaling that putrid 
pink liquid through their 
trunks. I drooled a bit, seeing 
the rainbow glint of sunlight 
on those magnificent tusks. 
Seconds passed, then minutes. 
The herd was practically 
slaked, and still no crawling 
Mimp reappeared from the 
hut. 

Soon they’d fly off, and cost 
me a fortune. 

I was already pretty much 
in hock after paying the fare 
to Polaris III from Earth. (I’d 
been able to save a little by 
listing Mimp as baggage, and 
storing him in the hold for the 
flight.) Angry, irked, and 
pretty well enraged, I moved 
swiftly toward the hut on 
hands and knees, scuttling in 
the doorway as fast as I could, 
lest the herd see me and flee, 
or attack. 

1 ST the parlor, I stood erect, 
and glanced about. There 
was no one in sight, but the 
back door was open. “Mimp!” 
I bellowed, stamping across 
the carpet. “Where are you, 
you off-color blemish!?’’ No 
reply. “This means six stripes 
with the knout!” I warned 
him. 

Then I heard a faint sound, 
not unlike that of a fourteen- 
inch bolo knife being brought 
down hard upon the inflating- 



valve of a pseudolog hut. I felt 
at my belt. My bolo was miss- 
ing. “Mimp!” I hollered, much 
too late. 

Then the whole damned 
room, piano, fireplace, carpet, 
armchair and all, snapped in 
upon me, and I was wound up 
with those rubberized walls 
tighter than the center of a 
golfball. I think I must have 
swooned, then. 

Much, much later, by dint 
of tooth, fingernail and sheer 
grit, I had gnawed, clawed 
and wrenched my way free of 
the collapsed hut. A stunning 
sight met my eyes. All about 
the waterhole, the flying tusk- 
ers were still kneeling. Every 
one of them was dead and al- 
ready beginning to rot. But 
the infuriating thing was that 
not one of them had so much 
as an inch of tusk any more. 

Every beast had been de- 
tusked, the priceless pearl 
shafts lopped off flush with 
the thick gray hides. Mimp! 
And with my bolo knife, al- 
ready! 

At least he’d left me a can- 
teen. I tasted it. Pffauah! 
Pink Polaris III slop ! The 
dirty little — ! But I saved it 
anyhow. I had a long lonely 
walk back to town ahead of 
me. 

And there it was that I 
learned even worse news. 

Mimp had alreday sold the 
tusks and was on his way back 
to Andromeda, with a fortune 
in his breechclout. I swore re- 
venge, then and there, but was 

129 



THE FLYING TUSKERS OF K'NIIK-K'NAAK 




unable to carry it out, since I 
was short the rocketfare back 
to Earth and the authorities. 
,(It seems that Polaris III is 
a neutral planet. Even the 
mighty word “Earthman” car- 
ries no weight there.) So I 
had to hock the piano, my pre- 
cious Moxley .55 and what 
could be salvaged of the souf- 
fle, and even then I was only 
able to book passage as near 
Earth as Sirius II. 

Luckily, they had a consu- 
late there. I was able to secure 
a ride home, after some weeks’ 
wait. By then, however, it was 
too late to avenge myself. 

Mimp, with his stolen for- 
tune, had paid off his planet’s 
debt to Earth. Andromeda IV 
(his home planet) declared its 
independence, and the Earth 
authorities throw up_their 
hands and shrug whenever I 



hint at extraditing him. Seems 
he's the new emperor there, 
or something. They can’t af- 
ford to antagonize him. Damn! 

However, I suppose you’re 
wondering just why I get 
goosebumps when I recall the 
flying tuskers of K’niik- 
K’naak. Well, it wasn’t so 
much the danger from the 
beasts, nor the hideous heat 
of that desert, nor my long, 
painful sojourn beneath the 
Steinway in the shrunken hut 
that was so bad. 

It was those tuskers. Know 
how they died? Mimp had 
poisoned the waterhole. Un- 
sporting, and all that, but the 
thing that nags my brain is: 
Why didn’t I think of that? 

Me ! Bested by a lousy pur- 
ple alien! 

What’s the universe coming 

to? end 



THUS SPAKE NIETZCHE 



Nietzche believed in an extinction which was not eternal. The entire 
world, according to him, was a mechanical dashing about of material 
atoms forming endless combinations. In course of time, he held, any given 
combination was bound to repeat itself; consequently each of us, after 
aeons of extinction, would find himself repeating his past life. The theory 
was glib nonsense. Nietzche was completely ignorant of science and did 
not know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics expressly forbids any 
such repetition of a past state of the material world.
