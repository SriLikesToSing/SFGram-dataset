When is 

T he cloud is still no bigger than a 
man's hand, but there it is: die 
time is rapidly drawing near when 
man will be able to replace his 
damaged parts widi artifacts — a 
little later, build in better parts than 
nature ever designed — later still, in- 
still in his own body equipment to 
handle functions nature never 
dreamed of. 

A most interesting and enjoyable 
book. The SemUArtificiak Man by 
Harold M. Schmeck, Jr. (Walker), 
makes it clear just how close we 
are to at least the first of these 
goals. There are scores of persons 
now alive who ought in all reason 
to be dead — persons whose kidneys 
have ceased to function, whose 
hearts have given out or gone into 
uncontrolled fibrillation, whose lungs 
have stopped supplying the blood 
with oxygen. 

ft is not science fiction but fact 
that in all of these cases doctors, 
engineers, chemists and physicists, 
working together, have managed to 
produce machines to take up the 
work that the so-called “vital organs” 
of the body no longer can do. The 
machines do not work every time. 
Sometimes they do sot even work 
iudcfinitefy. But it k a twentieth cen- 
tury miracle that they work at all.

cific Northwest who, twice a week.

sheets, filtering out the poisons 
their own organs are helpless to deal 
with, the measures of these accoin- 
plishments of medicine are, literally, 
life or death. 

T hat’s an fact, not fancy — for 
further information, see Sch- 
meck’s book, or your daily paper. 
But there’s more to the story than 
that. It is only a step from replacing 
a damaged organ to building one 
that is better — not a repair but an 
improvement. The human lung is 
a marvelous creation, but it is liable 
to pneumonia, cancer, emphysema 
and a hundred other ailments; and 
it is quite helpless to deal with even 
so simple a problem as extracting 
oxygen from the plentiful supply in 
sea- water. It is not l;:.rd to imagine 
that some sort of electreHfi»k lung- 
substitute will one day come off the 
drawing boards and into use — cap- 
able of keeping our blood oxygenated 
by extracting the vital gas from 
air, from water, or if need be from 
its own built-in storage supplies if 
we choose to wander for a time in 
empty space. There is even a name 
for the sort of hybrid creature, half 
man and half machine, that will use 
these super-prosthetics: the “cyborg”, 
or cybernetic organism.

Or robots?

Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 






THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of die miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den prpcesses of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud* 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc^ 
don by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
diousands of men and women who nri- 
vately use them in their homes towy.

iCTt’s not very comfortable foot- 

X ing, but at least you can’t 
fall off.” 

Even through the helmet phones, 
Silbert's voice carried an edge that 
Bresnahan felt sure was amused con- 
tempt. The younger man saw no 
point in trying to hide his fear; he 
was no veteran of space and knew 
that it would be silly to pretend oth- 
erwise 

“My mind admits that, but my 



stomach isn’t so sure,” he replied. 
“It can’t decide whether things wffl 
be better when I can’t see so fat, 
or whether I should just give up and 
take a running dive back there.” 

His metal-clad arm gestured to- 
ward the station and its comfortable 
spin hanging half a mile away. Tech- 
nically the wheel-shaped structure in 
its synchronous orbit was above the 
two men, but it took careful observ- 
ing to decide which way was really 
“up.” 

“You wouldn’t make it,” Silbert

replied. “If you had solid footing 
for a jump you might get that far, 
since twenty feet a second would 
take you away from here perman- 
ently. But speed and velocity are two 
different animals. I wouldn’t trust 
even myself to make such a jump 
in the right direction— and I know 
the vectors better than you do by a 
long shot. Which way would you 
jump? Right at the station? Or 
ahead of it, or behind it? And which 
is ahead and which is behind? Do 
you know?” 

“I know which is ahead, since I 
can see it move against the star 
background, but I wouldn’t know 
which way to jump. I think it should 
be ahead, since the rotation of this 
overgrown raindrop gives us less 
linear speed than the station’s orbit; 
but I wouldn’t know how far ahead,” 
Silbert said. 

“Good for you.” Bresnahan noted 
what he hoped was approval in the 
spaceman’s tone as well as in his 
words. “You’re right as far as you 
committed yourself, and I wouldn’t 
dare go any farther myself. In any 
case, jumping off this stuff is a 
losing game.” 

“I can believe that. Just walking 
on it makes me feel as though I 
were usurping a Biblical preroga- 
tive.” 

The computerman’s arm waved 
again, this time at the surface under- 
foot, and he tried to stamp on it at 
the same moment. The latter gesture 
produced odd results. The material, 
which looked a little like clear jelly, 
gave under the boot but bulged up- 
ward all around it. The bulge moved 
outward very slowly in all directions, 



the star patterns reflected in the suH 
face writhing as it passed. As thK 
bulge’s radius increased its height 
lessened, as with a ripple spreading 
on a pond. It might have been an 
ultra-slow motion picture of such a 
ripple, except that it did not travel 
far enough. It died out less than two 
yards from Bresnahan’s foot, though 
it took well over a minute to get 
that far. 

“Yeah, I know what you mean. 
Walking on water was kind of a 
divine gift, wasn’t it? Well, you can 
always remember we’re not right 
on the water. There’s the pressure 
film, even if you can’t see it.” 

“That’s so. Well, let’s get on to the 
lock. Being inside this thing can’t be 
much worse than walking around on 
its surface, and I have a report to 
make up.” Silbert started walking 
again at this request, though the 
jellylike response of the water to his 
footfalls made the resulting gait 
rather odd. He kept talking as he 
led the way. 

“How come that friend of yours 
can’t come down from the station 
and look things over for himself? 
Why should you have to give the 
dope to him second-hand? Can’t he 
take weightlessness?” 

“Better than I can, I suspect,” 
replied Bresnahan, “but he’s not my 
friend. He’s my boss, and pays the 
bills. Mine not to reason why, mine 
but to act or fry. He already knows 
as much as most people do about 
Raindrop, here. What more he ex- 
pects to get from me I’m not sure. 
I just hope that what I can find to 
teU him makes him happy. I take it 
this is the lock.” 



RAINDROP

T hey had reached a disk of metal 
sorr^ thirty feet in diameter, 
projecting about two feet from the 
surface of the satellite. It contin- 
ued below the surface for a distance 
which refraction made hard to esti- 
mate. 

Its water line was marked by a 
ring of black, rubbery-looking mater- 
ial where the pressure film adhered 
to it. The men had been quite close 
to it when they landed on Rain- 
drop’s surface a few minutes before, 
but it is hard to make out landscape 
details on a water surface under a 
black, starfilled sky; the reflection 
underfoot is not very different from 
the original above. A five-mile ra- 
dius of curvature puts the reflected 
images far enough down so that 
human depth perception is no help. 

Waves betrayed themselves, of 
course, and might have shown the 
lock’s location — but under a gravi- 
tational acceleration of about a tenth 
of an inch per second squared, the 
•urface waves raised by space-suit 
boots traveled much more slowly 
than the men who wore them. And 
with their high internal energy loss- 
es they didn’t get far enough to be 
useful. 

As a result, Bresnahan had not 
realized that the lock was at hand 
until they were almost upon it. Even 
Silbert, who had known about where 
they would land and could orient 
himself with Raindrop’s rotation 
axis by celestial reference features, 
did not actually see it until it was 
only a few yards away. 

“This is the place, all right,” he 
acknowledged. “That little plate near 
the edge is the control panel. We’ll 



use the manhole; no need to open 
the main hatch as we do when it’s a 
matter of cargo.” 

He bent over — slowly enough to 
keep his feet on the metal — and 
punched one of the buttons on the 
panel he . had pointed out. A tiny 
light promptly flashed green, and he 
punched a second button. 

A yard-square trap opened in- 
ward, revealing the top of a ladder. 
Silbert seized the highest rung and 
pulled himself through the opening 
head first — when a man weighs less 
than an ounce in full space panoply 
it makes little real difference when 
he elects to traverse a ladder head 
downward. Bresnahan followed and 
found himself in a cylindrical cham- 
ber which took up most of the inside 
of the lock structure. It could now be 
seen that this must extend some 
forty feet into the body of Raindrop. 

At the inner end of the compart- 
ment, where curved and flat walls 
met, a smaller chamber was parti- 
tioned off. Silbert dove in this direc- 
tion. 

“This is a personnel lock,” he re- 
marked. “We’ll use it; it saves flood- 
ing the whole chamber.” 

“We can use ordinary spacesuits?” 
“Might as well. If we were going 
to stay long enough for real work, 
we’d change — there is local equip- 
ment in those cabinets along the 
wall. Spacesuits are safe enough, 
but pretty clumsy when it comes to 
fine manipulation.” 

“For me, they’re clumsy for any- 
thing at all.” 

“Well, we can change if you want; 
but I understood that this was to be 
a fairly quick visit, and that you 



I 



IF 




were to get a report back pronto. 
Or did I misread the tone your 
friend Weisanen was using?” 

“I guess you didn’t, at that. Well 
go as we are. It still sounds queer 
to go swimming in a spacesuit.” 

“No queerer than walking on 
water Come on, the little lock will 
hold both of us.” 

The spaceman opened the door 
manually — there seemed to be no 
power controls involved — and the 
two entered a room some five feet 
square and seven high. Operation 
of the lock seemed simple; Silbert 
closed the door they had just used 
and turned a latch to secure it, then 
opened another manual valve on the 
other side of the chamber, A jet of 
water squirted in and filled the space 
in half a minute. Then he simply 
opened a door in the same wall with 
the valve, and the spacesuited fig- 
ures swam out. 

This was not as bad as walking 
on what had seemed like nothing- 
ness. Bresnahan was a good swimmer 
and experienced free diver, and was 
used to being suspended in a medium 
where one couldn’t see very far. 

The water was clear, though not 
as clear as that sometimes found in 
Earth’s tropical seas. There was no 
easy way to tell just how far vision 
could reach, since nothing familiar 
and of known size was in view ex- 
cept for ■ the lock they had just 
quitted. There were no fishes — Rain- 
drop’s owners were still debating the 
advisability of establishing them 
there — and none of tbt j^ant life was 
familiar, at least to Bresnahan. He 
knew that the big s^^ere of water 
had been seeded by ''artifidaT »e 



forms — algae and bacteria whose 
genetic patterns had been altered to 
let them live in a “sea” so different 
from Earth’s. 

n 

aindrop was composed of the 
iV nuclei of several small comets, 
or rather what was left of those nuc- 
lei after some of their mass had been 
used in reaction motors to put them 
into orbit about the earth. TTiey had 
been encased in a polymer film 
sprayed on to form a pressure seal, 
and then melted by solar energy, 
concentrated by giant foil mirrors. 

Traces of the original wrapping 
were still around, but its function 
had been replaced by one of the 
first tailored life forms to be es- 
tablished after the mass was liquid. 
This was a modification of one of 
the gelatin-capsule algae, which now 
encased all of Raindrop in a mi- 
croscc^ically Hhm film able to 
heal itself after small meteoroid 
punctures, and strong enough to 
maintain about a quarter of an at- 
mosphere’s pressure on the contents. 
The biological engineer who had 
done that tailoring job still regarded 
it as his professional masterpiece. 

The methane present in the orig- 
mal comet material had been oxi- 
dized by other bacteria to water and 
carbon dioxide, the oxygen of course 
coming from normal photosynthesis. 
A good deal of the ammonia was still 
present, and furnished the principal 
reason why genetic tailoring was still 
necessary on life forms being trans- 
planted to the weightless aquarium. 

The men were drifting very slow-

IF 




ly away from the lock, though they 
bad stopped swimming, and the 
younger one asked, 

“How do we find our way back 
here if we get out of sight?” 

“The best trick is not to get out 
of sight. Unless you want to examine 
the core, which I’ve never done, 
you’ll see everything there is to see 
right here. There is sonic and mag- 
netic gear — homing equipment — ^tn 
your suit if you need it, though I 
haven’t checked you out on its use. 
You’d better stay with me. I can 
probably show you what’s needed. 
Just what points do you think Weis- 
anen wants covered?” 

“Well, he knows the general phy- 
sical setup — temperature, rotation, 
general current pattern, the nature 
of the skin. He knows whafs be^ 
planted here at various times; but ifs 
hard to keep up to date on what's 
evolved since. These tailored life 
forms aren’t very stable toward mu- 
tation influences, and a new-stocked 
aquarium isn’t a very stable ecolog- 
ies environment He’ll want to know 
what’s here now in tiie way of us- 
able plants, I suppose. You inow the 
Agency sold Raindrop to a private 
ooncem after the last election. The 
new owners seem willing to grant the 
importance of basic research, hvA 
Aey would sort of like a profit to 
ttpori to the sftockholders as wdl.** 
“Amen. Fm a stockholder.” 

“Oh? Well, it docs cost something 
to keep supply ships coming up here, 
and—” 

ii'T^roe enough. Then this Weis- 
-L anen character represents the 
new owners? I wonder if I should 



think of him as my boss or iny ena- 
ployee.” 

“I think he is one of them.” 
“Hmph. No wonder.” 

“No wonder what?” 

“He and his wife are the first 
people I ever knew to treat a space 
flight like a run in a private yacht, 
I suppose that someone who could 
buy Raindrop wouldn’t be bothered 
by a Httlc expense like a private 
Phoenix rocket” 

“I suppose not. Of course, it isn’t 
as bad as it was in the days of chem- 
ical motors, when it took a big com- 
mercial concern or a fair-sized gov- 
ernment to launch a manned space- 
ship.” 

“Maybe not; but with fourteen 
billion people living on Earth, it’s a 
little unusual to find a really rich 
individual, in the old Ford-Carnegie 
tradition. Most big concerns are 
owned by several million people like 
me. 

“Wefl, I guess Weisanen owns a 
bigger piece of Raindrop than you 
do. Anyway, he’s my boss, whether 
he’s yours or not and he wants a 
repent from me, and I can’t sea 
much to rqport on. What life is 
tiiere in this place besides the stuff 
forming the surface skin?” 

“Oh, lots. You just aren’t looking 
carefully enough. A lot of it is mi- 
croscopic, of course; there are fakiy 
ordinary varieties of pond-scum drift- 
ing aH around us. They’re the main 
reason we can see only a couple of 
hundred yards, and they carry on 
most of the photosynthesis. Then 
are lots of non-photosynthetic orgtfip 
isms — bacteria — ^producing carbon 

dioxide just as in any balanced eo- 



lAIKDROP

ology on Earth, though this place is 
a long way from being balanced. 
Sometimes the algae get so thick 
you can’t see twenty feet, sometimes 
the bacteria get the upper hand. The 
balance keeps hunting around even 
when no new forms are appearing 
or being introduced. We probably 
brought a few new bacteria in with 
us on our suits just now; whether any 
of them can survive with the am- 
monia content of Raindrop this high 
I don’t know, but if so the ecology 
will get another nudge. 

‘‘There are lots of larger plants, 
too — mostly modifications of the big 
seaweeds of Earth’s oceans. The lock 
behind us is overgrown with them, 
as you can see — ^you can look more 
closely as we go back — and a lot 
of them grow in contact with the 
outer skin, where the light is best. 
Quite a few are free-floating, but of 
course selection works fast on those. 
There are slow convection currents, 
because of Raindrop’s size and ro- 
tation, which exchange water be- 
tween the illuminated outer regions 
and the darkness inside. Free-floating 
weeds either adapt to long periods 
of darkness or die out fast. Since 
there is a good deal of hard radi- 
ation near the surface, there is also 
quite a lot of unplanned mutation 
over and above the regular gene- 
tailoring products we are constantly 
adding to’ the pot. And since most 
of the organisms here have short life 
spans, evolution goes on rapidly.” 

“Weisanen knows all that perfect- 
ly well,” replied Bresnahan. “What 
he seems to want is a snapshot — a 
report on just what the present spec- 
trum of life forms is like.” 



“I’ve summed it up. Anything 
more detailed would be wrong next 
week. You can look at the stuff 
around us — there. Those filaments 
which just tangled themselves oa 
your equipment clip are a good ex- 
ample, and there are some bigger 
ones if you want there — just in 
reach. It would take microscopic 
study to show how they differ from 
the ones you’d have gotten a week 
ago or a year ago, but they’re dif- 
ferent. There will be no spectacular 
change unless so much growth builds 
up inside the surface film that tha 
sunlight is cut down seriously. Then 
the selection factors will change and 
a radically new batch — probably of 
scavenger fungi — will develop and 
spread. It’s happened before. We’va 
gone through at least four cycles of 
that sort in the three years Fva 
worked here.” 

B resnahan frowned thoughtfully, 
though the facial gesture was 
not very meaningful inside a space 
helmet. 

“I can see where this isn’t going 
to be much of a report,” he re- 
marked. 

“It would have made more sense 
if you’d brought a plankton net and 
some vacuum jars and brought up 
specimens for him to look over him- 
self,” replied Silbert. “Or wouldn't 
they mean anything to him? Is he a 
biologist or just a manager?” 

“I couldn’t say.” 

“How come? How can you woik 
for him and not know that much?” 
“Working for him is something 
new. I’ve worked for Raindrop ever 
since I started working, but I didn't 



12 



IF 




meet Weisanen until three weeks 
•go. I haven’t been with him more 
than two or three hours’ total time 
■ince. I haven’t talked with him dur- 
ing those hours; I’ve listened while 
he told me what to do.” 

“You mean he’s one of those high- 
handed types? What’s your job, any- 
way?” 

“There’s nothing tough or un- 
pleasant about him; he’s just the 
boss. I’m a computer specialist — ^ 
programming and maintenance, oi 
was until he picked me to come up 
here to Raindrop with him and his 
wife. What my job here will be, 
youHl have to get from him. There 
are computers in the station, I no- 
ticed, but nothing calling for full- 
time work from anyone. Why he 
picked me I can’t guess. I should 
tiiink though, that he’d have asked 
you rather than me to make this re- 
port, since whatever I am I’m no 
biologist.” 

“Well, neither am I. I just work 
here.” 

Bresnahan stared in astonishment. 

“Not a biologist? But aren’t you in 
efaarge of this place? Haven’t you 
been the local director for three 
years, in charge of planting the new 
He forms that were sent up, and re- 
porting what happened to them, and 
how Raindrop was holding together, 
and all — ?” 

“All is right. Fm the bo’s’un tight 
and the midshipmite and the crew 
of the captain’s gig. I’m the boss be- 
cause I’m the only one here full 
time; but that doesn’t make me a 
biologist. I got this job because I 
have a decently high zero-gee tol- 
erance and had had experience in 



space. I was a space-station handy- 
man before I came here.” 

“Then what sort of flumdiddle is 
going on? Isn’t there a professional 
anywhere in this organization? I’ve 
heard stories of the army using bio- 
chemists for painters and bricklayers 
for clerks, but I never really be- 
lieved them. Besides, Raindrop 
doesn’v belong to an army — it isn’t 
even a government outfit any more. 
It’s being run by a private outfit 
which I assumed was hoping to make 
a profit out of it. Why in blazes is 
there no biologist at what has always 
been supposed to be a biological re- 
search station, devoted to finding 
new ways of making fourteen billion 
people like what little there is to 
eat?” 

g ilbert’s shrug was just discernible 
from outside his suit. 

“No one ever confided in me,” he 
replied. “I was given a pretty good 
briefing on the job when I first took 
it over, but that didn’t include an ex- 
tension course in biology or biophys- 
ics. As far as I can tell they’ve been 
satisfied with what I’ve done. What- 
ever they wanted out of Raindrop 
doesn’t seem to call for high-caliber 
professionals on the spot. I inspect 
to make sure no leaks too big for the 
algae to handle show up, I plant any 
new life forms they send up to be 
established here, and I collect reg- 
ularly and send back to Earth the 
samples of what life there is. The 
last general sampling was nearly a 
month ago, and another is due in a 
few days. Maybe your boss could 
make do with that data — or if you 
like I can offer to make the regular 



RAIKDROP

sampling run right away instead ol 
at the scheduled time. After an, he 
may be my boss too instead of die 
other way around, so I should bo 
reporting to him.” 

Bresnahan thought for a moment 

“All right,” he said. “I’m in no 
position to make either a decent col- 
lection or a decent report, as things 
stand. Let’s go back to the station, 
tell him what’s what, and let him 
decide what he does want. Maybe 
it’s just a case of a new boss not 
knowing the ropes and trying to 
find out.” 

“I’d question that, somehow, but 
can’t think of anything better to do. 
Come on.” 

Silbert swam back toward the 
lock from which they had emerged 
only a few minutes before. They 
had drifted far enough from it in 
that time so that its details had fad- 
ed to a greenish blur, but there was 
no trouble locating the big cylinder. 
The door they had used was still 
open. 

Silbert pulled himself through, 
lent Bresnahan a hand in doing like- 
wise, closed the portal, and started 
a small pump. The pressure head 
was only the quarter atmosphere 
maintained by the tension of the 
alga skin, and emptying the cham- 
ber of water did not take long. The 
principal delay was caused by Bres- 
nahan’s failure to stand p^cctly 
still; with gravity only a little over 
one five-thousandths Earth normal, 
it didn’t take much disturbance to 
slosh some water away from the bot- 
tom of the lock where the pump in- 
take was located. 

Silbert waited for some of it to set- 



e, but lacked the patience lo watt 
foT it all. When he opened die door 
into the larg^ lock chambo: the 
men were accompanied tluroug^ it 
by several large ^obules of boiling 
liquid. 

“Wasteful, but helps a bit,” re- 
marked the spaceman as he opened 
the outside portal and the two were 
wafted dirough it by the escaping 
vapor. “Watch out — ^hang on there. 
You don’t have escape velocity, but 
you’d be quite a while getting back 
to the suriace if you let yourself 
blow away.” He seized a convenient 
limb of ^esnahan’s space armor as 
the younger man drifted by, and 
since he was well anchored himself 
to the top rung of the ladder was 
able to arrest the other’s flight. Care- 
fully they stepped away from the 
hatch, Silbert touching die closing 
button widi one toe as he passed it, 
and looked for the orbiting station. 

This, of course, was directly over- 
head. The same temptation which 
Bresnahan had feh earlier to make 
a jump for it came back with some 
force; but Silbert had a safer tech- 
nique. 

He took a small tube equipped 
with peep-sights from the equip- 
ment clip at his side and aimed it 
very carefully at the projecting bid) 
of the wheel-shaped station — ^the only 
part of the hub visible, since the sta- 
tion’s equator was paralld to dial 
of Raindrop and the structure was 
therefore edge-on to them. A bright 
yellow gjow from the target pro- 
duced a grunt of satisfaction from 
Silbert, and he fingered a button on 
the tube. The laser beam, invisible 
kt the surrounding vacuum, flicked 



14 



IF 




on and off in a precisely timed sig- 
nal pattern which was reported 
faithfully by the source-return mir- 
ror at the target. Another response 
was almost as quick. 

Ill 

A faintly glowing object emerged 
from the hub and drifted rapid- 
ly toward Raindrop, though not 
quite toward the men. Its details 
were not clear at first, but as it ap- 
proached it began to look more and 
more like a luminous cobweb. 

“Just a lattice of thin rods, doped 
with luminous paint for spotting and 
launched from the station by a spring 
gun,” explained Silbert. “The line 
connecting it with the station isn’t 
painted, and is just long enough to 
stop the grid about fifty feet from 
the water. It’s launched with a small 
backward component relative to the 
station’s orbit, and when the line 
stops it it will drift toward us. Jump 
for it when I give the word; you 
can’t miss.” 

Bresnahan was not as certain 
about the last statement as his com- 
panion seemed to be, but braced him- 
self anyway. As the glowing spider- 
web approached, however, he saw 
it was over a hundred feet across 
and realized that even he could jump 
straight enough to make contact. 
When Silbert gave the word, he 
sprang without hesitation. 

He had the usual moment of 
nausea and disorientation as he 
crossed the few yards to his target. 
Lacking experience, he had not 
“balanced” his jump perfectly and 
as a result made a couple of somer- 



saults en route. This caused him !• 
lose track of his visual reference 
points, and with gravity already lack- 
ing he suffered the moment cf near- 
panic which so many student pilots 
had experienced before him. Contact 
with one of the thin rods restored 
him, however; he gripped it fran- 
tically and was himself again. 

Silbert arrived a split second later 
and took charge of the remaining 
maneuvers. These consisted of c<^ 
lapsing the “spiderweb” — a matter 
of half a minute, in spite of its ap- 
parent complexity, because of tho 
ingenuity of its jointing — and then 
starting his companion hand-over- 
hand along the nearly invisible cord 
leading back to the station. The 
climb called for more coordination 
that was at first evident; the spaco- 
man had to catch his less exper- 
ienced companion twice as the latter 
missed his grip for the line. 

Had Silbert been going first tte 
situation might have been serioi*. 
As it was, an extra tug on the rope 
enabled him to catch up each time 
with the helpless victim of basii 
physics. After the second accident, 
the guide spoke. 

“All right, don’t climb any m<Mn» 
We’re going a little too fast as it k. 
Just hold on, to the rope now and 
to me when I give the word. The 
closing maneuver is a bit tricky, and 
it wouldn’f be practical to try te 
teach you the tricks on the spot and 
first time around.” 

Silbert did have quite a problem. 
The initial velocities of the tW9 
men in their jumps for the spider- 
web had not, of course, been the cor- 
rect ones to intercept the station — 



RAINDROP 



ti 




if it had been practical to count on 
their being so, the web would have 
been superfluous. The web’s own 
mass was less than fifty pounds, 
which had not done much to the 
sum of those vectors as it absorbed 
its share of the men’s momentum. 
Consequently, the men had an an- 
gular velocity with respect to the 
station, and they were approaching 
the latter. 

T 'o a seventeenth century mathe- 
matician, conservation of an- 
gular momentum may have been an 
abstract concept, but to Silbert it 
was an item of very real, practical, 
everyday experience — ^just as the 
orbit of a comet is little more than 
a set of numbers to an astronomer 
while the orbit of a baseball is some- 
tiling quite different to an outfield- 
er. The problem this time was even 
worse than usual, partly because 
of Bresnahan’s mass and still more 
because of his inexperience. 

As the two approached the station 
their sidewise motion became evi- 
dent even to Bresnahan. He judged 
that they would strike near the rim 
<rf the spinning structure, if they 
hit it at all, but Silbert had other 
ideas. 

Changing the direction of the spin 
axis by landing at the hub was one 
thing — very minor one. Changing 
the rate of spin by meeting the edge 
Qould be a major nuisance, since 
much of the apparatus inside was 
built on and for Earth and had 
Earth’s gravity taken for granted in 
its operation. Silbert therefore had 
no intention of making contact any- 
where but at one of the “poles” of 



station. He was rather in the situa- 
tion of a yo-yo whose string is wind- 
ing up on the operator’s finger; but 
he could exercise a little contrcrii br 
climbing as rapidly as possible “up” 
the cord toward the structure or al- 
lowing himself to slide “down” away 
from it. 

He had had plenty of experience, 
but he was several minutes playing 
them into a final collision with the 
entry valve, so dose to the center 
of mass of the station that the im- 
pact could produce only a tiny pre- 
cession effect. Most of its result was 
a change in the wheel’s orbit about 
Raindrop, and the whole maneuver 
had taken such a small fraction of an 
orbital period that this effect nearly 
erffset that produced when they had 
started up the rope. 

“Every so often,” remarked the 
spaceman as he opened the air lock, 
“we have to make a small correction 
in the station orbit; the disturbances 
set up by entering and leaving get it 
out of step with Raindrop’s rotation. 
Sometimes I wonder whether ifi 
worth the trouble to keep the two 
synchronized.” 

“If the station drifted very far 
from the lock below, you’d have to 
jump from the liquid surface, which 
might be awkward,” pointed out the 
younger man as the closing hatch 
cut off the starlight. 

“That’s true,” admitted the other 
as he snapped a switch and air 
started hissing into the small lock 
chamber. “I suppose there’s some- 
thing to be said for tradition at that. 
There’s the safety light — ” as a green 
spot suddenly glowed on the wall — 
you can open up your suit 



14 



IF 




whenever you like. Lookers are in 
the next room. But you arrived 
through this lock, didn’t you?” 

‘‘Right. I know my way from 
here.” 

Five minutes later the two men, 
divested ot space suits, had “descend- 
ed” to the rim of the station where 
weight was normal. Most of this 
part of the structure was devoted to 
living space which had never been 
used, though there were laboratory 
and communication rooms as well. 
The living space had been explained 
to Bresnahan, when he first saw it, 
why Silbert was willing to spend 
three quarters of his time alone at a 
rather boring job a hundred thousand 
miles from the nearest company. 
Earth was badly crowded; not one 
man in a million had either as much 
space or as much privacy. 

Wei^nen and his wife had taken 
over a set of equally sumptuous 
rooms on the opposite side of the 
rim, and had been in the process of 
setting up housekeeping when the 
two employees had descended to 
Raindrop’s surface a short time be- 
fore. This had been less than an 
hour after their arrival with Bres- 
nahan on the shuttle from Earth; 
Weisanen had wasted no time in is- 
suing his first orders. The two men 
were prepared to find every sign of 
disorder when the door to the “head- 
quarters” section opened in response 
to Albert’s touch on the annunciator, 
but they had reckoned without Mrs. 
Weisanen. 

A t their employer’s invitation, they 
entered a room which might 
have been lived in for a year m- 



sfead of an hour. The furniture was 
good, comfortable, well arranged, 
and present in quantity which would 
have meant a visible bulge in a na- 
tion’s space research budget just for 
the fuel to lift it away from the earth 
in the chemical fuel days. 

Either the Weisanens felt strong- 
ly about maintaining the home at- 
mosphere even when visiting, or they 
planned to stay on the station few 
quite a while. 

The official himself was surprise 
ingly young, according to both Bres- 
nahan’s and Silbert’s preconceived 
notions of a magnate. He could 
hardly have been thirty, and mi^t 
have been five years younger. Ho 
matched Bresnahan’s five feet ten 
of height and looked about the same 
weight; but while the computerman 
regarded himself as being in good 
physical shape, he had to admit the 
other was far more muscular. Even 
Silbert’s six feet five of height and 
far from insignificant frame seemed 
somehow inadequate beside Weisan- 
en’f. 

“Come in, gentlemen. We felt your 
return a few minutes ago! I take it 
you have something to report, Mr. 
Bresnahan. We did not expect you 
back quite so soon.” Weisanen drew 
further back from the door and 
waved the others past him. “What 
can you tell us?” He closed the door 
and indicated armchairs. Bresnahan 
remained on his feet, uneasy at the 
incompleteness of his report; Silbert 
sank into the nearest chair. The of- 
ricial also remained standing. “Well, 
Mr. Bresnahan?” 

“I have little — practically nothing 
— ^to report, as far as detailed, quan- 



RAINDROP 



17 




dtative information is concerned,” 
die computerman took the plunge. 

“We stayed inside the Raindrop 
only a few minutes, and it was evi- 
dent that most of the detailed search 
for life specimens would have to be 
made with a microscope. I hadn’t 
planned the trip at all effectively. I 
now understand that there is plank- 
ton-collecting apparatus here which 
Mr. Silbert uses regularly and which 
should have been taken along if I 
were to get anything worth show- 
ing to you.” 

Weisanen’s face showed no change 
in its expression of courteous inter- 
est. “That is quite all right,” he said, 
“I should have made clear that I 
wanted, not a detailed biological re- 
port, but a physical description by a 
non-specialist of what it is like sub- 
jectively down there. I should im- 
agine that you received an adequate 
impression even during your short 
stay. Can you give such a descrip- 
tion?” 

Bresnahan’s worried expression 
disappeared, and he nodded affirm- 
atively. 

“Yes, sir. Fm not a literary ex- 
pert, but I can tell what I saw.” 

“Good. One moment, please,” 
Weisanen turned toward another 
door and raised his voice. “Brenda, 
will you come in here, please? You 
rfiould hear this,” 

Silbert got to his feet just as the 
woman entered, and both men ac- 
knowledged her greeting. 

Brenda Weisanen was a full head 
Aorter than her husband. She was 
wearing a robe of the sort which 
might have been seen on any house- 
wtte expecting company; neither 



man was competent to guess whether 
it was worth fifty d<^ars or ten times 
that. The garment tended to focus at- 
tention on her face, which would 
have received it anyway. Her hair 
and eyebrows were jet black, the 
eyes themselves gray, and rounded 
cheeks and chin made the features 
look almost childish, though she 
was actually little younger than her 
husband. She seated herself prompt- 
ly, saying no more than convention 
demanded, and the men followed 
suit. 

“Please go on, Mr. Bresnahan,” 
Weisanen said. “My wife and I are 
both greatly interested, for reasons 
which will be clear shortly.” 

B resnahan had a good visual mem- 
ory, and it was easy for him to 
comply. He gave a good verbal pic- 
ture of the greenish, sunlit haze that 
had surrounded him — sunlight dif- 
fering from that seen under an 
Earthly lake, which ripples and 
dances as the waves above refract it 
He spoke of the silence, which had 
moved him to keep talking because 
it was the “quietest” silence he had 
known, and “didn’t sound right.” 
He was interrupted by Silbert at 
this point; the spaceman explained 
that Raindrop was not always that 
quiet. Even a grain-of-dust meteoroid 
striking the skin set up a shock wave 
audible throughout the great sphere; 
and if one were close enough to tbo 
site of collision, the hiss of water 
boiling out through the hole for the 
minute or two needed for the skin 
to heal could also be heard. It was 
rather unusual to be able to spend 
even the short time they had just had 



IF 




inside the satellite withcatt hearing 
either of these sounds. 

Bresnahan nodded thanks as the 
other fell silent, and took up the 
thread of his own description once 
more. He closed with the only real 
feature he had seen to describe — 
the weed-grown cylinder of the 
water-to-space lock, hanging in 
greenish emptiness above the dead- 
black void which reached down to 
Raindrop’s core. He was almost 
poetical in spots. 

The Weisanens listened in flatter- 
ing silence until he had done, and 
remained silent for some seconds 
thereafter. Then the man spoke. 

“Thank you, Mr. Bresnahan. That 
was just what we wanted.” He turned 
to his wife. “How does that sound 
to you, dear?” 

T he dark head nodded slowly, its 
gray eyes fastened on some 
point far beyond the metal walls. 

“It’s fascinating,” she said slowly. 
“Not just the way we pictured it, of 
course, and there will be changes 
anyway, but certainly worth seeing. 
Of course they didn’t go down to the 
core, and wouldn’t have seen much 
if they had. I suppose there is no 
life, and certainly no natural light, 
down there.” 

“There is life,” replied Silbert. 
“Non-photosynthetic, of course, but 
bacteria and larger fungi which live 
on organic matter swept there from 
the sunlit parts. I don’t know whether 
anything is actually growing on the 
core, since I’ve never gone in that 
far, but free-floating varieties get car- 
ried up to my nets. A good many of 
those have gone to Earth, along with 



their descriptions, m my tegular re- 
ports.” 

“I know. I’ve read those reports 
very carefully, Mr. Silbert,” replied 
Weisanen. 

“Just the same, one of our first 
jobs must be to survey that core,” 
his wife said thoughtfully. “Much of 
what has to be done will depend on 
conditions down there.” 

“Right.” Her husband stood up. 
“We thank you gentlemen for your 
word pictures; they have helped a 
lot. I’m not yet sure of the relation 
between your station time and that 
of the Terrestrial time zones, but I 
have the impression that it s quite 
late in the working day. Tomorrow 
we will all visit Raindrop and make 
a very thorough and more technical 
examination — my wife and 1 doing 
the work, Mr. Bresnahan assisting 
us, and Mr. Silbert guiding. Until 
then — it has been a pleasure, gen- 
tlemen.” 

Bresnahan took the hint and got 
to his feet, but Silbert hesitated. 
There was a troubled expression on 
his face, but he seemed unable or 
unwilling to speak. Weisanen noticed 
it. 

“What’s the matter, Mr. Silbert? 
Is there some reason why Raindrop’s 
owners, or their representatives, 
shouldn’t look it over closely? I 
realize that you are virtually the only 
person to visit it in the last three 
years, but I assure you that your job 
is in no danger.” 

Silbert’s face cleared a trifle. 

“It isn’t that,” he said slowly. “I 
know you’re the boss, and I wasn’t 
worried about my job anyway. 
There’s just one point — of course 



RAINDROP 



If 




you may know all about it, but I’d 
rather be safe, and embarrassed, than 
responsible for something unfortun- 
ate later on. I don’t mean to butt 
into anyone’s private business, but 
Raindrop is essentially weightless.” 
“I know that.” 

“Do you also know that unless 
you are quite certain that Mrs. Weis- 
anen is not pregnant, she should not 
expose herself to weightlessness for 
more than a few minutes at a time?” 
Both Weisanens smiled. 

“We know, thank you, Mr. Silbert. 
Wc will see you tomorrow, in space- 
suits, at the big cargo lock. There is 
much equipment to be taken down to 
Raindrop.” 

IV 

T hat closing remark proved to be 
no exaggeration. 

As the four began moving articles 
through the lock the next morning, 
Silbert decided at first that the 
Weisanen’s furniture had been a 
very minor item in the load brought 
up from Earth the day before, and 
wondered why it had been brought 
into the station at all if it were to 
be transferred to Raindrop so soon. 
Then he began to realize that most 
of the material he was moving had 
been around much longer. It had 
come up bit by bit on the regular 
supply shuttle over a period of sev- 
eral months. Evidently whatever 
was going on represented long and 
careful planning — and furthermore, 
whatever was going on represented 
a major change from the original 
plans for Raindrop. 

This worried him, since Silbert 



had become firmly attached to the 
notion that the Raindrop plan was 
an essential step to keeping the 
human race fed, and he had as good 
an appetite as anyone. 

He knew, as did any reasonably 
objective and well-read adult, how 
barely the advent of fusion power 
and gene tailoring had bypassed the 
first critical point in the human 
population explosion, by making it 
literally possible to use the entire 
surface of the planet either for liv- 
ing space or the production of food. 
As might have been expected, man- 
kind had expanded to fill even that 
fairly generous limit in a few gen- 
erations. 

A second critical point was now 
coming up, obviously enough to 
those willing to face the fact. Most 
of Earth’s fourteen billion people 
lived on floating islands of gene- 
tailored vegetation scattered over 
the planet’s seas, and the number 
of these islands was reaching the 
point where the total sunlight reach- 
ing the surface was low enough to 
threaten collapse of the entire food 
chain. Theoretically, fusion power 
was adequate to provide synthetic 
food for all; but it had been learned 
the hard way that man’s selfishness 
could be raised to the violence point 
almost as easily by a threat to his 
“right” to eat natural — and tasty 
— food as by a threat to his “right” 
to reproduce without limit. As a 
matter of fact, the people whom 
Silbert regarded as more civilized 
tended to react more strongly to the 
first danger. 

Raindrop had been the proposed 
answer. As soon as useful, edible 



20 



IF 




life forms could be tailored to live 
in its environment it was to be 
broken up into a million or so 
smaller units which could receive 
sunlight throughout their bulks, and 
use these as “farms.” 

dut power units, lights, and what 
looked like prefabricated living 
quarters sufficient for many fa'^nlies 
did not fit with the idea of breaking 
Raindrop up. In fact, they did not 
fit with any sensible idea a* all. 

No one could live on Raindrop, 
or in it. permanently; there was not 
enough weight to keep human me- 
tabolism balanced. Silbert was very 
conscious of that factor. He never 
spent more than a day at a time on 
his sampling trips, and after each of 
these he always remained in the 
norm a I- weight part of. the station 
for the full number of days speci- 
fied on the AGT tables. 

It was all very puzzling. 

And as the day wore on, and 
more and more material was taken 
from the low-weight storage section 
of the station and netted together 
for the trip to Raindrop, the space- 
man grew more puzzled still. He 
said nothing, however, since he 
didn’t feel quite ready to question 
the Weisanens on the subject and 
it was impossible to speak privately 
to Bresnahan with all the spacesuit 
radios on the same frequency. 

A ll the items moved were, of 
course, marred with their 
masses, but Silbert made no great 
effort to keep track of the total 
tonnage. It was not necessary, since 
eacn cargo net was loaded as nearly 
as possible to an even one thousand 



pounds and it was easy enough to 
count the nets when the job was 
done. There were twenty-two nets. 

A more ticklish task was install- 
ing on each bundle a five hundred 
pound-second solid-fuel thrust car- 
tridge, which had to be set so that 
its axis pointed reasonably close to 
the center of mass of the loaded net 
and firmly enough fastened to main- 
tain its orientation during firing. It 
was not advisable to get rid of the 
orbital speed of the loads by “push- 
ing off” from the station; the lat- 
ter’s orbit would have been too 
greatly altered by absorbing the 
momentum of eleven tons of mater- 
ial. The rockets had to be used. 

Silbert, in loading the nets, had 
made sure that each was spinning 
slowly on an axis parallel to that 
of Raindrop. He had also attached 
each cartridge at the “equator” erf 
its net. As a result, when the time 
came to fire it was only necessary 
to wait beside each load until its 
rocket was pointing “forward" 
along the station’s orbit, and touch 
off the fuel. 

The resulting velocity change did 
not, in general, exactly offset the 
orbital speed, but it came close 
enough for the purpose. The new 
orbit of each bundle now intersected 
the surface of Raindrop — a target 
which was, after all. ten miles in 
diameter and only half a mile away. 
It made no great difference if the 
luggage were scattered along sixty 
degrees of the satellite’s equatorial 
zone; moving the bundles to the lock 
by hand would be no great problem 
where each one weighed about three 
and a half ounces.

IF 




With the last net drifting toward 
the glistening surface of Raindrop, 
Weisanen turned to die ^aceman. 

“What’s the best tech^que to 
send us after them? Just jump off?*’ 
Silbert frowned, thou^ the ex- 
pression was not obvious through 
his face plate. 

“The best technique, according to 
the AGT Safety Tables, is to go 
back to the rim of the station and 
spend a couple of days getting our 
personal chemistry back in balance. 
We’ve been weightless for nearly ten 
hours, with only one short l^eak 
when we ate.” 

Weisanen made a gesture of im- 
patience which was much mon visi- 
ble than Silbert’s frown. 

“Nonsense!” he exchdmed. “Peo- 
ple have remained weightless for a 
couple of weeks at a time wWiout 
permanent damage.” 

“Without having dieir bones ac- 
tually turn to rubber, I grant I 
don’t concede there was no more 
subtle damage done. Pm no bio- 
physicist, I just befieve die tables; 
they were worked out on die basis 
of knowledge gained the hard way. 
I admit they have a big safety fac- 
tor, and if you consider it really 
necessary J won’t object to staying 
out for four or five days. But you 
haven’t given us any idea so for 
why this should be considered an 
emergency situation.” 

44T Tmmm. So I haven’t. All right, 
AA will you stay out long 
enough to show Brenda and me how 
to work the locks below, so we 
can get the stuff inside?” 

“Why — of course — ii it’s that 



im|>ortant we’ll stay and do the work 
too. But I didn’t — ” 

S^ert fell silent as it dawned on 
him that Weisanen’s choice of 
words meant that he had no inten- 
tion of explaining just yet what 
the “emergency” was. Both new- 
comers must have read the space- 
man’s mind quite accurately at that 
point, since even Bresnahan was 
idile to, but neither of them said 
anything. 

Conversadon for the next few 
mimdes consisted entirely of Sil- 
berfi instructions for Aoving off in 
the proper directicm to reach Rain- 
drop, and how to walk on its not- 
quite-zcro-gravity, jellylike surface 
after they reached it The trip it- 
srif was made without incident. 

Because fast movement on the 
surface was impossible, several 
hours wwe spent collecting the scat- 
tered bundles and stacking them by 
the lock. The material could not be 
placed inside, as most of it had to 
be assembled before it could go un- 
do* water; so for the moment the 
lesson in lock management was 
postponed. Weisanen, after some 
hesi^on, agreed to Silbert’s second 
request that they return to the sta- 
tion for food and rest. He and his 
wife watdied with interest the tech- 
nique of getting back to it. 

Widi four people instead of two, 
the velocity-matcWng problem might 
have been worse, but this turned out 
not to be the case. Silbert wondered 
whether it were strictly luck, or 
whether the Weisanens actually had 
the skill to plan their jumps proper- 
ly. He was beginning to suspect that 
both of them had had previous 



RAINDROP 



23 




space experience, and both were 
certainly well-coordinated physical 
specimens. 

According to the tables which had 
been guiding Silbert’s life, the party 
should have remained in the high- 
weight part of the station for at 
least eighty hours after their session 
of zero-gee, but his life was now 
being run by Weisanen rather than 
tbe tables. The group was back on 
the water twelve hours after leaving 
it. 

Bresnahan still had his feeling of 
discomfort, with star-studded empti- 
ness on one side and its reflection 
on the other, but he was given little 
time to brood about it. 

The first material to go into the 
lock consisted of half a dozen yard- 
wide plastic bubbles of water. Sil- 
bert noted with interest that all con- 
tained animal life, ranging from 
barely visible Crustacea to herring- 
sized fish. 

“So we’re starting animal life 
here at last,” remarked the space- 
man. “I thought it was a major 
bone of contention whether we ever 
would.” 

“The question was settled at the 
first meeting of the new board,” re- 
plied Weisanen. “Life forms able 
to live here — or presumably able to 
live here — have been ready for sev- 
eral years. Please be careful in 
putting those in’ the look — just the 
odd-numbered ones first, please, 
first. The evens contain predators, 
and the others should be given a 
few hours to scatter before they are 
turned loose.” 

“Right. Any special techniques 
for opening? Or just get the bubbles 



through the second lock and cut 
them open?” 

“That will do. 1 assume that a 
few hours in the currents inside, 
plus their own swimming abilities, 
will scatter them through a good 
part of the drop.” 

“It should. I suppose they’ll tend 
to stay pretty close to the skin be- 
cause of the light; I trust they can 
take a certain amount of hard radia- 
tion.” 

“That matter has been considered. 
There will be some loss, damage, 
and genetic change, of course, but 
we think the cultures will gain in 
spite of that. If they change, it is 
no great matter. We expect rapid 
evolution in an environment Iflce 
this, of course. It’s certainly been 
happening so far.” 

B resnahan helped push the proper 
spheres into the lock at the 
vacuum end and out of it at the 
other, and watched with interest as 
each was punctured with a knife 
and squeezed to expel the contents. 

“I should have asked about wait- 
ing for temperatures to match,” re- 
marked Silbert as the cloud of bare- 
ly visible, jerkily moving specks 
spread from the last of the con- 
tainers, “but it doesn’t seem to be 
bothering them.” 

“The containers were lying on 
Raindrop’s surface all night, and the 
satellite is in radiative equilibrium,” 
pointed out Bresnahan. “The tem- 
peratures shouldn’t be very different 
anyway. Let’s get back outside and 
see what’s going on next. Either 
these water-bugs are all right, or 
they’re beyond our help.” 



24 



ir 




‘‘Right.” Silbert followed the sug- 
gestion, and the newly released ani- 
mals were left to their own devices. 

Outside, another job was under 
way. The largest single items of 
cargo had been a set of curved seg- 
ments of metal, apparently blue- 
anodized aluminum. In the few 
minutes that Silbert and Bresnahan 
had been inside, the Weisanens had 
sorted these out from the rest of 
the material and were now fitting 
them together. 

Each section attached to its neigh- 
bor by a set of positive-acting snap 
fasteners which could be set almost 
instantly, and within a very few 
minutes it became evident that they 
formed a sphere some twenty feet 
in diameter. A transparent dome 
of smaller radius was set in one 
pole, and a cylindrical structure 
with trap doors in the flat ends 
marked the other. With the assem- 
bly complete, the Weisanens care- 
fully sprayed everything, inside and 
out, from cylinders which Silbert 
recognized as containing one of the 
standard fluorocarbon polymers used 
for sealing unfindable leaks in 
space ships. 

Then both Weisanens went in- 
side. 

Either the' metallic appearance of 
the sphere was deceptive or there 
were antennae concealed m its struc- 
ture, because orders came through 
the wall on the suit-radio frequency 
without noticeable loss. In response 
to these, Bresnahan and the space- 
man began handing the rest of the 
equipment in through the cylindrical 
structure, which had now revealed 
itself a& a minute air lock. As eadi 



item was received it was snapped 
down on a spot evidently prepared 
to receive it, and in less than two 
hours almost all the loose gear had 
vanished from the vicinity of Rain- 
drop’s entry lock. The little that 
was left also found a home as Weii- 
anen emerged once more and fasten- 
ed it to racks on the sphere’s outer 
surface, clustered around the air 
lock. 

T he official went back inside, 
and, at his orders, Silbert and 
the computerman lifted the whole 
sphere onto the top of the cylindri- 
cal cargo lock of the satellite. Either 
could have handled the three-pound 
weight alone, but its shape and size 
made it awkward to handle and 
both men felt that it would be in- 
advisable to roll it. 

“Good. Now open this big hatch 
and let us settle into the lock chana- 
ber,” directed Weisanen. “Thea 
close up, and let in the water.” 

It was the first time Silbert had 
caught his boss in a slip, and he 
was disproportionately pleased. The 
hatch opened outward, and it wae 
necessary to lift the sphere off again 
before the order could be obeyed. 

Once it was open, the two men 
had no trouble tossing the big globe 
into the yawning, nearly dark hole 
— the sun was just rising locally 
and did not shine into the chamber 
— ^but they had to wait over a min- 
ute for Raindrop’s feeble gravity 
to drag the machine entirely inside. 
They could not push it any faster, 
because it was not possible to get 
a good grip on sphere and lock 
edge simultaneously; and pushing 



RAINDROP 



2i 




dow n on the sphere without good 
anchorage would have done much 
more to the pusher than to the 

sphere. 

However, it was finally possible to 
dose Ac big trap. After making 
sure that it was tightly latched — it 
was sddom used, and Silbert did 
not trust its mechanism unreserved- 
ly — he and Bresnahan entered the 
lock through Ac smaller portal. 

“Aren’t Acre special suits for use 
kiside Raindrop, a lot more com- 
fortable Aan Ais space armor?” 
asked Weisanen. 

“Yes, sir,” replied Ae spaceman, 
“Aough Ae relative comfort is a 
matter of opinion. There are only 
Arec, and two of Aem haven’t been 
used since I came. They’ll need a 
careful checkout” 

“All right. Bring Aem in here, 
and Aen let Ae water into Ah 
lock.” Silbert found Ae suits and 
handed them to Bresnahan to carry 
out Ae first part of Ae order, while 
he went to the controls to execute 
Ae second. 

“An ready?” he asked. 

“All set. BoA lock doors here 
are shut, and the three of us are 
inside. Let Ac flood descend.” 

‘Wrong verb,” muttered Silbert 
to himself. 

He very cautiously cracked the 
main inner hatch; opening it would 
have been asking for disaster. Even 
at a mere quarter atmosphoe’s pres- 
sure Ae wall of water would have 
riammcd into the evacuated look 
violently enough to tear the outer 
pmtal away and ^ect sphere and 
occi^Mu^ at a e peo d well above 
Raindropli escape valae. There wes 

U 



a small Phoenix rocket in the sta 
tion for emergency use, but Silbert 
had no wish to create a genuine ex- 
cuse for using it. Also, since he was 
in the lock himself, he would prob- 
ably be in no condition to get or 
pilot it. 

V 

T he water sprayed in violently 
enough through the narrow 
opening he permitted, bouncing the 
sphere against the outer hatch and 
making a deafening clamor even for 
Ae spacesuited trio inside. How- 
ever, nothing gave way, and in a 
minute it was safe to open the main 
hatch completely. 

Silbert did so. Through the clear 
dome which formed the sphere’s 
only observation window he could 
see Weisanen fingering controls in- 
side. Water jets from almost in- 
visible ports in the outer surface 
came into action, and for the first 
time it became evident Aat the 
sphere was actually a vehicle. It 
was certainly not built for speed, 
but showed signs of being one of 
Ae most maneuverable ever built. 

After watching for a moment as 
it worked its way out of the lock, 
ISIbert decided that Weisanen had 
had little chance to practice han- 
dling it. But no catastrophe occur- 
red, and finally Ae globe was hang- 
ing in Ae greenish void outside Ae 
weed-grown bulk of Ae lock. The 
spaceman closed the big hatch, 
emerged Arou^ Ae personnel lock 
himself, and swam over to Ae vehi- 
cle’s entrance. 

The outer door of the tiny air 

IF 




lock opened manually. Thirty sec- 
onds later he was inside the rather 
crowded sphere removing his hel- 
met — some time during the last 
few minutes Weisanen had filled 
the vehicle with air. 

The others had already unhel- 
mcted and were examining the “div- 
ing” suits which Bresnahan had 
brought inside. These were simple 
enough affairs; plastic form-fitting 
coveralls with an air-cycler on the 
chest and an outsized, transparent 
helmet which permitted far more 
freedom of head movement than 
most similar gear. Since there was 
no buoyance in this virtually 
weight-free environment, the hel- 
met’s volume did not create the 
problem it would have on Earth. 
Silbert was able to explain every- 
thing necessary about the equip- 
ment in a minute or two. 

Neither of the Weisanens needed 
to have any point repeated, and if 
Bresnahan was unsure about any- 
thing he failed to admit it. 

“All right.” Raindrop’s owner nod- 
ded briskly as the lesson ended. “We 
seem to be ready. I started us down 
as soon as Mr. Silbert came aboard, 
but it will take the best part of an 
hour to reach the core. When we 
get there a regular ecological sam- 
pling run win be made. You can 
do that, Mr. Silbert, using your 
regular equipment and techniques; 
Ac former is aboard, whether you 
noticed it being loaded or not. Bren- 
da and I will make a physical, and 
physiographical, examination of the 
core itself, wi& a view to finding 
jost what wfll have to be done to 
set up living quarters there and 

lAINDaOP 



where will be the best place to build 
them.” 

S ilbeit’s reaction to this remark 
may have been expected; both 
Weisanens had been watching him 
with slight smiles on their faces. He 
did not disappoint them. 

“L/ving quarters? That’s ridicu- 
lous! There’s no weight to speak of 
even at Raindrop’s surface, and even 
less at the core. A person would 
lose the calcium from his skeleton 
in a few weeks, and go unbalanced 
in 1 don’t know how many other 
chemical ways — ” 

“Fourteen known so far, Mr. Sil- 
bert. We know all about that, or 
as much as anyone does. It was a 
shame to tease you, but my husband 
and I couldn’t resist Also, some 
of the factors involved are not yet 
public knowledge, and we have rea- 
sons for not wanting them too wide- 
ly circulated for a while yet.” Bren- 
da Weisanen’s interruption was 
saved from rudeness by the smile 
on her face. “I would invite you to 
sit down to listen, but sitting means 
nothing here — I’ll get used to that 
eventually, no doubt. 

“The fact you just mentioned 
about people leaching calcium out 
of their skeletons after a few days 
CH* weeks of weightlessness was 
learned long ago — even before long 
manned space flights had been 
made; the information was gained 
from flotation experiments. Strictly 
speaking, it is not an effect ot 
weightlessness per se, but a feedback 
phenomenon involving relative mus- 
cular effort — something which 
mi^t have been predicted, and for 

rr 




all I know may actually have been 
predicted, from the fact that the 
ankle bones in a growing child 
ossify much more rapidly than the 
wrist bones. A very minor genetic 
factor is involved; after all, animals 
as similar to us as dolphins which 
do spend all their time afloat grow 
perfectly adequate skeletons. 

“A much more subtle set of 
chemical problems were noticed the 
hard way when manned space sta- 
tions were set up, as you well know. 
A lot of work was done on these, as 
you might expect, and we now are 
quite sure that all which will pro- 
duce detectable results in less than 
five years of continuous weightless- 
ness are known. There are fourteen 
specific factors — chemical and ge- 
netic keys to the log jam, if you 
like to think of it that way. 

“You have the ordinary educated 
adult’s knowledge of gene tailoring, 
Mr. Silbert. What was the logical 
thing to do?” 

“Since gene tailoring on human 
beings is flagrantly illegal, for good 
and sufficient reasons, the logical 
tihing to do was and is to avoid 
weightlessness,” Silbert replied. 
“With Phoenix rockets, we can 
make interplanetary flight at a 
continuous one-gravity acceleration, 
while space stations can be and arc 
centrifuged.” 

Brenda Weisanen’s smile did not 
change, but her husband looked an- 
noyed. He took up the discussion. 

“Illegal or not, for good or bad 
reasons, it was perfectly reasonable 
to consider modifying human gene- 
tic patterns so that some people at 
least could live and work normally 



and indefinitely in a weightless en- 
vironment. Whether it shocks yoo 
or not, the thing was tried over 
seventy years ago, and over five 
hundred people now alive have this 
modification — and are not, as I 
suppose you would put it, fully 
human.” 

B resnahan interrupted. “I would 
not put it that way!” he snap- 
ped. “As anyone who has taken 
work in permutation and combina- 
tion knows perfectly well, there is 
no such thing as a fully human be- 
ing if you define the term relative 
to some precise, specific idealized 
gene pattern. Mutations are occur- 
ring all the time from radiation, 
thermal effects, and just plain 
quantum jumping of protons in the 
genetic molecules. The sort of 
phenomenon is used as example ma- 
terial in elementary programming 
courses, and one of the first things 
you learn when you run such a 
problem is that no one is complete- 
ly without such modifications. If, 
as I suppose you are about to say, 
you and Mrs. Weisanen are gene- 
tically different enough to take 
weightlessness, I can’t see why it 
makes you less human. I happen to 
be immune to four varieties of 
leukemia virus and sixteen of the 
organisms usually responsible for 
the common cold, according to one 
analysis of my own gene pattern. 
If l^rt’s had ever been checked 
we*d find at least as many peculiari- 
ties about his — and I refuse to ad- 
mit that either of us is less human 
dian anyone else we’ve ever met** 
“Thank you, Mr. Bresnahan,**

Brenda Weisanen took up the thread 
of the discussion once more. “ The 
usual prejudice against people who 
are known to be significantly differ- 
ent tends to make some of us a 
little self-conscious. In any case, my 
husband and I can stand weightless- 
ness indefinitely, as far as it is now 
possible to tell, and we plan to stay 
here permanently. More of us will 
be coming up later for the same 
purpose.” 

“But why? Not that it’s any of 
my business. I like Raindrop, but 
it’s not the most stimulating en- 
vironment and in any case I’m 
known to be the sort of oddball 
who prefers being alone with a col- 
lection of books to more other ac- 
tivities.” 

The woman glanced at her hus- 
band before answering. He shrug- 
ged. 

“You have already touched on 
the point, Mr. Silbert. Modifying 
the human genetic pattern involves 
the same complication which plagu- 
ed medicine when hormones became 
available for use in treatment. Any 
one action is likely to produce sev- 
eral others as an unplanned, and 
commonly unwanted, by-product. 
Our own modification is not with- 
out its disadvantages. What our 
various defects may be I would 
not presume to list in toto — any 
more than Mr, Bresnahan would 
care to list his — but one of them 
strikes very close to home just now. 
Aino and I are expecting a child, 
and about nine times out of ten 
when a woman of our type remains 
in normal gravity any child she con- 
ceives is lost during the fifth or 



sixth month. The precise cause is 
not known; it involves the mother’s 
physique rather than the child’s, but 
that leaves a lot still to be learned. 
Therefore, I am staying here until 
my baby is born, at the very least. 
We expect to live here. We did not 
ask to be modified to fit space, but 
if it turns out that we can live bet- 
ter here — so be it.” 

“Then Raindrop is going to be 
turned into a — a — maternity hos- 
pital?” 

iiT think a fairer term would be 
JL ‘colony,’ Mr. Silbert,” inter- 
jected Weisanen. “There are a good 
many of us, and most if not all of 
us are considering making this place 
our permanent home.” 

“Which means that breaking it up 
according to the original plan to 
supply farming volume is no longer 
on the books.” 

“Precisely.” 

“How do you expect to get away 
with that? This whole project was 
planned and paid for as a new 
source of food.” 

“That was when it was a govern- 
ment project. As you know, it be- 
came a private concern recently; the 
government was paid full value for 
Raindrop, the station, and the shut- 
tle which keeps it supplied. As of 
course you do not know, over 
eighty per cent of the stock of that 
corporation is owned by people like 
myself. What we propose to do is 
perfectly legal, however unpopular 
it may make us with a few people.” 
“More than a few, I would say. 
And how can you afford to be really 
unpopular, living in something as 



RAINDROP 



29 




fragile as Raindrop?” queried Bres- 
nahan. “There are lots of space- 
ships available. Even if no official 
action were or could be taken, any- 
one who happened to have access 
to one and disliked you sufficiently 
could wreck the skin of this tank 
so thoroughly in five minutes that 
you’d have to start all over again 
even if you yourselves lived through 
it. All the life you’d established 
would freeze before repairs could 
be made complete enough to stop 
the water from boiling away.” 

“That is true, and is a problem 
we haven’t entirely solved,” admit- 
ted the other. “Of course, the nasty 
laws against the publication of pos- 
sible mob-rousing statements which 
were found necessary as Earth’s 
population grew should operate to 
help us. Nowadays many people re- 
act so negatively to any unsupport- 
ed statement that the word would 
have trouble getting around. In any 
case, we don’t intend to broadcast 
the details and comparatively few 
people know much about the Rain- 
drop project at all. I don’t think 
that many will feel cheated.” 

Silbert’s reaction to the last sen- 
tence was the urge to cry out, “But 
they are being cheated!” However, 
it was beginning to dawn on him 
that he was not in the best possible 
position to argue with Weisanen. 

He subsided. He himself had been 
living , with the Raindrop project for 
three years, had become closely 
identified with it, and the change of 
policy bothered him for deeper rea- 
sons than his intelligence alone 
could recognize. 

Bresnahan was also bothered, 



though he was not as deeply in love 
with the project as the spaceman. 
He was less impressed by Weisan- 
en’s conviction that there would be 
no trouble; but he had nothing use- 
ful to say about the matter. He was 
developing ideas, but they ran 
along the line of wondering when 
he could get to a computer key- 
board to set the whole situation up 
as a problem. His background and 
training had left him with some 
doubt of any human being’s ability 
— including his own — to handle 
all facets of a complex problem. 

Neither of the Weisanens seem- 
ed to have any more to say, either, 
so the sphere drifted downward in 
silence. 

VI 

T hey had quickly passed the lim- 
it which sunlight could reach, 
and were surrounded by blacknesa, 
which the sphere’s own interior 
lights seemed only to accentuate. 

With neither gravity nor outside 
reference points, the sphere was of 
course being navigated by instru- 
ment. Sonar equipment kept the 
pilot informed of the distance to the 
nearest point of the skin, the dis- 
tance and direction of the lock 
through which they had entered, 
and the distance and direction of 
the core. Interpretation of the echoes 
was complicated by the fact that 
Raindrop’s outer skin was so sharp- 
ly curved, but Weisanen seemed to 
have that problem well in hand ai 
he drove the vehicle downward. 

Pressure, of course, did not change 
•ignificantly with depth. The thirty 



30 



IF 




per cent increase from skin to core 
meant nothing to healthy people. 
There was not even an instrument 
to register this factor, as far as Sil- 
bert could see. He was not too 
happy about that; his spaceman’s 
prejudices made him feel that there 
should be independent instrumenta- 
tion to back up the sonar gear. 

As they neared the core, how- 
ever, instruments proved less neces- 
sary than expected. 

To the mild surprise of the Weis- 
anens and the blank astonishment 
of Silbert — Bresnahan knew too 
little to expect anything, either way 
— the central region of the satellite 
was not completely dark. The light 
was so faint that it would not have 
been noticed if they had not been 
turning off the sphere’s lamps every 
few minutes, but it was quite bright 
enough to be seen, when they were 
a hundred yards or so from the 
core, without waiting for eyes to be- 
come dark-adapted. 

“None of your samples ever in- 
cluded luminous bacteria,” remark- 
ed the official. *T wonder why none 
of them ever got close enough to 
the skin for you to pick up.” 

“I certainly don’t knOw,” replied 
Silbert. “Are you sure it’s caused by 
bacteria?” 

“Not exactly by a long shot; it 
just seems the best starting guess. 
I’m certain it’s not heat or radio- 
activity, and offhand I can’t think 
of any other possibilities. Can you?” 

“No, I can’t. But maybe whatever 
is producing the light is attached to 
the core — growing on it, if it’s 
alive. So it wouldn’t have reached 
the surface.” 



“That’s possible, though I hope 
you didn’t think I was criticizing 
your sampling techniques. It was 
one of my friends who planned 
them, not you. We’ll go on down; 
we’re almost in contact with the 
core now, according to the fatho- 
meter.” 

Weisanen left the lights off, ex- 
cept for the tiny fluorescent sparks 
on the controls themselves, so the 
other three crowded against th# 
bulge of the viewing port to se« 
what was coming. Weightlessness 
made this easier than it might have 
been; they didn’t have to “stand” al 
the same spot to have their heads 
close together. 

For a minute or so, nothing was 
perceptible in the way of motion. 
There was just the clear, faintly 
luminous water outside the port 
Then a set of slender, tentacular 
filaments as big around as a human 
thumb seemed to writhe past thn 
port as the sphere sank by them; 
and the eyes which followed their 
length could suddenly see their point 
of attachment. 

“There!” muttered Brenda Weis- 
anen softly. “Slowly, dear — only a 
few yards.” 

“There’s no other way this thing 
can travel,” pointed out her hus- 
band. “Don’t worry about our hit- 
ting anything too hard.” 

“I’m not — but look! It’s* beauti- 
ful! Let’s get anchored and go out- 
side.” 

“In good time. It will stay there, 
and anyway I’m going out before 
you do — long enough before to, at 
least, make reasonably certain ifa 
safe.” 






RAINDROP 





T he wife looked for a moment 
as though she were about to 
argue this point, if her facial ex- 
pression could be read accurately 
in the faint light, but she said 
nothing. Bresnahan and Silbert had 
die intelligence to keep quiet as 
well; more could be learned by 
looking than by getting into the 
middle of a husband-wife disagree- 
ment, and now there was plenty to 
look at. 

The core was visible for at least 
two hundred yards in all directions, 
as the ^.sphere spun slowly under 
Weisanen’s control. The light defi- 
nitely came from the life forms 
which matted its surface. 

Presumably these were fungi, 
since photosynthetic forms could 
hardly have grown in such an en- 
vironment, but they were fungi 



which bore little resemblance to 
their Terrestrial ancestors. Some 
were ribbon-like, some feather-like, 
some snaky — even patches of what 
looked like smoothly mown lawn 
were visible. The greenish light was 
evidently not pure color, since other 
shades were visible; red, purple, and 
yellow forms stood out here and 
there in eye-catching contrast to 
grays and browns. Some forms were 
even green, though it seemed un- 
likely that this was due to chloro- 
phyll. Practically all seemed to emit 
the vague light which bathed the 
entire scene — so uniformly that 
outlines would have been hard to 
distinguish were it not for a few 
specimens which were much bright- 
er than the others. These types bore 
what might have been spore pods; 
brilliantly luminous knobs ranging

IF 




from fist to grapefruit size, raised 
“above” the rest of the surface as 
much as eight or ten feet on slender 
stalks. These cast shadows which 
helped distinguish relief. 

The woman was right; weird it 
might be, but the scene was beauti- 
ful. 

Weisanen cut off the water jets 
and waited for a minute or two. 
The vehicle drifted slowly but per- 
ceptibly away from the surface; 
evidently there was some current. 

“We’ll have to anchor,” he re- 
marked. “Bren, stay inside until 
we’ve checked. I’ll go out to see 
what we can fasten ourselves to; 
there’s no information at all on 
what sort of surface there may be. 
A fair-sized stony meteormd — 
really an asteroid — was used as 
the original core, but the scAids 



from the comets would be very fins 
dust. There could be yards of 
too fine to hold any sort of anchor' 
surrounding the solid part. You gen- 
tlemen will please get into the other 
suits and come with me. If nothiM 
has happened to any of us in has 
an hour, Bren, you may join us.* 
“There are only three suits, ” hit 
wife pointed out. 

“True. Well, your spiacesuit wBI 
do; or if you prefer, one of us w3i 
use his and let you have the diviogj 
gear. In any case, that problem m\ 
low-priority. If you gentlemen ai» 
ready we’h go. I’ll start; this li 
strictly a one-man air lock.”- 
All three had been climbing out 
of their spacesuits as Weisanen war 
talking. TTie other garments wem 
easy enough to get into, though 
Bresnahan found the huge helmet 



RAINDROP 



unwieldy even with no weight 
Weisanen was through the lock be- 
fore either of the others was ready 
to follow; Silbert was slowed by his 
space-bom habit of double-checking 
every bit of the breathing appara- 
tus, and Bresnahan by his inexperi- 
ence. They could see their employ- 
er through the window as they fin- 
ished, swimming slowly and care- 
fully toward the weedy boundary of 
Raindrop’s core. 

Both men stayed where they were 
for the moment, to see what would 
happen when he reached it. Brenda 
Weisanen watched even more close- 
ly; there was no obvious reason to 
be afraid, but her breath was com- 
ing unevenly and her fists tightly 
clenched as her husband approached 
the plants and reached out to touch 
the nearest. 

XTothing spectacular happened. It 
yielded to has touch; when he 
seized it and pulled, it broke. 

“Either the plants are awfully 
fragile or there is fairly firm ground 
anchoring them,” remarked Silbert. 
“Let’s go outside. You’re checked 
out on the controls of this thing, 
aren’t you, Mrs. Weisanen?” 

“Not in great detail,” was the re- 
ply. “I know which switches handle 
lights and main power for the lock 
pump, and which control bank deals 
with the jets; but I’ve had no prac- 
tice in actually handling it. Aino 
hadn’t, either, until we started this 
trip an hour ago. Go ahead, though; 
I won’t have to do anything any- 
way. Aino is anchoring us now.” 

She gestured toward the port. 
Her husband could now be seen 



through it carrying something 
a harpoon, with a length of fins 
line attached to it A couple of yarcb 
from the surface he poised himself 
and hurled the object, javelin style 
— or as nearly to that style as any- 
one can manage in water — into the 
mass of vegetation. 

The shaft buried itself complete- 
ly. Weisanen gave a tug on the line, 
whose far end was attached to the 
sphere. He seemed satisfied and 
turned to look at the vehicle. See- 
ing the men still inside, he gestured 
impatiently. Bresnahan followed Sil- 
bert through the tiny air lock as 
rapidly as its cycling time would 
permit, leaving the woman alone in 
the sphere. 

Outside, Weisanen was several 
yards away, still beckoning imperi- 
ously. 

“You can talk, sir,” remarked 
Silbert in ordinary tones. “There’s 
no need for sign language.” 

“Oh. Thanks; I didn’t see any ra- 
dio equipment in these helmets.*^ 

“There isn’t any. The helmets 
themselves aren’t just molded plas- 
tic; they’re a multi-layered arrange- 
ment that acts as an impedance 
matcher between the air inside and 
die water outside. Sound goes 
through water well enough; it’s the 
air-water interface that makes con- 
versation difficult. This stuff gets 
the sound across the boundary.” 

“All right; good. Let’s get to 
work. If the figures for the size of 
the original nucleus still mean any- 
thing, we have nearly twenty mil- 
lion square feet to check up on. 
Right now we won’t try to do it 
att; stay in sight of the sphere. Get

lest rods and pbinkton gear from 
tfiat rack by ^ air lock. Mr. Sil- 
bert, use the nets and collectors as 
you usually do. Mr. Bresnahan, you 
and I will use the rods; simply poke 
them into the surface every few 
yards. The idea is to get general 
knowledge of the firmness of the 
underlying surface, and to find the 
best places to build — or attach — 
permanent structures. If you should 
happen to notice any connection 
between the type of vegetation and 
the kind of ground it grows on, so 
much the better; surveying by eye 
will be a lot faster than by touch. 
If any sort of trouble comes up, 
yell. I don’t see why there should 
be any, but I don’t want Brenda out 
here until we’re a little more cer- 
tain.” 

T^he men fell to their rather 
^ monotonous tasks. The plant 
cover, it developed, ranged from an 
inch or two to over a yard in thick- 
ness, not counting the scattered 
forms which extended their tendrils 
scores of feet out toward the dark- 
ness. At no point was the under- 
lying “ground” visible. 

Where the growing cover was 
pushed or dug away, the core seem- 
ed to be made of a stiff, brownish 
clay, which reached at least as deep 
as the test prods could be pushed 
by hand. This rather surprised Sil- 
bert, who had expected either solid 
rock or oozy mud. He was not geo- 
chemist enough to guess at the re- 
actions which might have formed 
what they actually found, and was 
too sensible to worry about it be- 
fore actual analyses had been made. 



If Weisanen had any opinions, he 
kept them to himself. 

Bresnahan was not worried about 
the scientific aspect of the situation 
at all. He simply poked away with 
his test bar because he had been 
told to, devoting only a fraction of 
his attention to the task. His 
thoughts were elsewhere. 

Specifically, he was following 
through the implications of the in- 
formation the Weisanens had fur- 
nished during the trip down. He ad- 
mitted to himself that in the other’s 
position he would probably be do- 
ing the same thing; but it seemed as 
though some compromise should be 
possible which would salvage the 
original purpose of Raindrop. 

Bresnahan did not, of course, ex- 
pect to eat as well as the average 
man of mid-twentieth century. He 
never had, and didn’t know what 
he was missing. He did know, how- 
ever, that at his present age of twen- 
ty-five there was a smaller variety 
of foodstuffs available than he 
could remember from his childhood, 
and he didn’t want that process to 
go any farther. Breaking up Rain- 
drop according to the original plan 
seemed to him the obvious thing to 
do. If land and sea farming areas 
were disappearing under the popula- 
tion flood, the logical answer was 
farming areas in the sky. This 
should be as important to the Weis- 
anens as to anyone else. 

He felt a little uneasy about 
bringing the matter up again, how- 
ever. Somehow, he had a certain 
awe of Weisanen which he didn’t 
think was entirely due to the fact 
that the latter was his employer. 



RAINDROP 



35 




Several times their paths came 
close together as the two plied their 
test bars, but Bresnahan was unable 
to wind his courage up to the neces- 
sary pitch for some time — not, in 
fact, until they had been exploring 
the region uneventfully for over 
half an hour and Weisanen had 
finally, with some hesitation, de- 
cided that it was safe for his wife 
to join them. 

There was some slight rivalry be- 
tween Silbert and Bresnahan over 
who should give up his diving gear 
to the woman and resume his space- 
suit If Bresnahan had won, a good 
deal of subsequent trouble might 
have been avoided; but when all 
four were finally outside, Silbert 
was wearing space armor. He had 
pointed out quite logically that he 
was the most used to it and would 
work better than any of the otners 
in its restrictions. 

VII 

T he key to the subsequent trouble 
was that one of the restrictions 
involved communication. If Silbert 
had been able to hear clearly, he 
might have understood what was 
developing before it had gone too 
far; but he couldn’t. His space hel- 
met lacked the impedance-matching 
feature of. the diving gear, and the 
latter equipment had no radios. 

Some sound did get through his 
helmet both from and into the 
water, but not much; for real con- 
versation he had to bring the helmet 
into physical contact with that of 
the other party. He therefore knew 
little of what went on during the 



next few minutes. He spent them 
continuing his ecology sample, and 
paid little attention to anything else. 

With Mrs. Weisanen present, 
some of Bresnahan’s unease in her 
husband’s presence left him, and he 
brought up at last the point which 
had occurred to him. 

“I’ve been wondering, sir,” he 
opened, “whv it wouldn’t be pos- 
sible to break up Raindrop just as 
was planned, and still use the small- 
er drops as homes for people like 
yourselves. I can’t see that it would 
be verv different from your present 
plan.”' 

Weisanen did not seem annoyed, 
but answered in a straightforward 
fashion. “Aside from the fact that 
we would prefer to be in a single 
city rather than a lot of detached 
houses which would require us to 
visit our neighbors by spaceship, the 
smaller drops will have the radia- 
tion problem. Here we have nearly" 
five miles of water shielding us.” 
“Hmph. I never thought of that.” 
“No reason why you should have. 
It was never your problem.” 

“But still — what do we do about 
food? Conditions on Earth are get- 
ting worse all the time. Starting an- 
other Raindrop project would take 
years. Couldn’t you at least com- 
promise? Permit the small drops to 
be skimmed off the surface of this 
one while you are living here, and 
while another Raindrop is set up?” 
“I don’t' like the idea. Can you 
imagine what it will be like here 
with shock waves from exploding 
steam bubbles echoing all through 
the globe every time the skin is 
opened for a new farm lot?”

IF 




"Why should they break the 
•kin? I should think they’d want to 
draw off the water through the lock, 
or other locks which might be built, 
anyway; otherwise there’d be a lot 
of waste from boiling. I should 
think—” 

W eisanen’s annoyance suddenly 
boiled over, though no sign 
of it had been visible before. 

"Mr. Bresnahan, it matters very 
little what you think when you for- 
get that Raindrop is now, legally 
and properly, private property. I 
dislike to sound selfish and mis- 
anthropic, but I belong to a group 
which has gone to a great deal of 
thought and labor to get for itself, 
legally and without violence, an en- 
vironment which it needs and which 
no one else — including the people 
responsible for our existence — was 
willing to provide. In addition, if 
you would think with your brain in- 
stead of your stomach you’d realize 
that the whole original project was 
pure nonsense. The only possible 
way mankind can keep himself 
adequately fed is to limit his popu- 
lation. If you’ll pardon the pun, the 
whole idiotic project was a drop 
in the bucket. It might have put 
the day of reckoning back five 
years, conceivably ten or fifteen, 
but then we’d have been right back 
where we started. Even with fusion 
energy there’s a limit to the num- 
ber of space farms which could be 
built in a given time, and the way 
Earth’s population grows it would 
soon be impossible just to make new 
farms fast enough, let alone operate 
them. Cheating people? Nonsense! 



We’re doing the rest of n^ankind a 
favor by forcing them to face facts 
while there are a few billion less of 
them to argue with each other. One 
group has had to exercise the same 
sort of control the rest of mankind 
should be using for a good half 
century. We didn’t dare have chil- 
dren except when it was practicable 
to keep the mother in orbit for the 
best part of a year. Why should we 
be particularly sympathetic with 
the rest of you?” 

"I see your point,” admitted 
Bresnahan, “but you’ve forgotten 
one other thing. The food problem 
is yours, too. What will you do as 
your food supply shrinks like ev- 
eryone else’s? Or worse, when peo- 
ple decide not to send any food at all 
up here, since you won’t send any 
down? Raindrop is a long way yet 
from being self-supporting, you 
know.” 

A grin, clearly visible in the 
light from a nearby plant knob, ap- 
peared on Weisanen’s face; but his 
irritation remained. 

"Slight mistake, my young friend. 
There is another minor modifica- 
tion in our structure; our saliva 
glands produce an enzyme you lack. 
We can digest cellulose.” He waved 
his hand at the plants around them. 

"How do you know these plants 
contain cellulose?” 

"All plants do; but that’s a side 
issue. The weeds near the surface 
were analyzed long ago, and proved 
to contain all the essentials for 
human life — in form which we can 
extract with our own digestive ap- 
paratus. Raindrop, as it now is, 
could support all of us there are

■ow and there are likely to be for 
a couple of generations. Now, please 
get back to checking this little world 
of ours. Brenda and I want to de- 
cide where to build our house.” 

B resnahan was silent, but made no 
move to get back to work. He 
floated for a minute or so, thinking 
furiously; Weisanen made no effort 
to repeat or enforce his order. 

At last the computerman spoke 
slowly — and made his worst mis- 
take. 

“You may be right in your legal 
standing. You may be right in your 
opinion about the value of Rain- 
drop and what the rest of the hu- 
man race should do — personally, 
I want a family some day. You may 
even be right about your safety 
from general attack because the 
communication laws will keep down 
the number of people who know 
about the business. But, right or 
wrong, if even a single person with 
access to a spaceship does find out, 
then you — and your wife — and 
your baby — are all in danger. 
Doesn’t that suggest to you that 
some sort of compromise is in or- 
der?” 

Weisanen’s expression darkened 
and his muscles tensed. His wife, 
looking at him, opened her mouth 
and made a little gesture of protest 
even before he started to speak; but 
if she made a sound it was drowned 
out. 

“It certainly suggests something, 
young fellow,” snapped the official. 
“I was hoping the matter wouldn’t 
descend to this level, but remember 
that while we can live here indefi- 



nitely, you cannot. A few weeks ol 
weightlessness will do damage which 
your bodies can never repair. Thera 
is no regular food down here. And 
we control the transportation back 
to the station and weight.” 

“Aino — no!” His wife laid a 
hand on his arm and spoke urgent- 
ly. “Wait, dear. If you threaten at 
all, it’s too close to a threat of 
death. I don’t want to kill anyone, 
and don’t want to think of your do- 
ing so. It wouldn’t be worth it. ’ 
“You and the little one are worth 
it. Worth anything! I won’t listen 
to argument on that.” 

“But argument isn’t needed. There 
is time. Mr. Bresnahan and his 
friend will certainly wait and think 
before risking the consequences of 
a mob-raising rumor. He wants a 
compromise, not — ” 

“His compromise endangers you 
and the others. I won’t have it. Mr. 
Bresnahan, I will not ask you for a 
promise to keep quiet; you might 
be the idealistic type which can 
justify breaking its word for what 
it considers a good cause. Also, I 
will not endanger your life and 
health more than I can help. Brenda 
is right to some extent; I don’t want 
a killing on my conscious either, 
regardless of the cause. Therefore, 
you and Mr. Silbert will remain 
here at the core until Brenda and 
I have returned to the station and 
made sure that no communication 
gear will function without our 
knowledge and consent. Ihai may 
be a few days, which may be more 
than your health should risk. I’m 
sorry, but I’m balancing that risk 
to you against one to us.”

**Why should it take days? An 
hour to the surface, a few minutes 
to the station — ” 

“And Heaven knows how long to 
find and take care of all the radios. 
Neither of us is an expert in that 
field, and we’ll be a long time mak- 
ing sure we have left no loopholes.” 
“Will you at least stop to find out 
whether the air renewers in these 
diving suits are indefinite-time ones, 
like the spacesuit equipment? And 
if they aren’t, let me change back 
into my spacesuit?” 

“Of course. Change anyway. It 
will save my trying to get the sub- 
stance of this conversation across 
to Mr. Silbert. You can tell him 
on radio while we are on the way. 
Come with me back to the sphere 
and change. Brenda stay here.” 
•^ut, dearest — this isn’t right. 
You know — ” 

“I know what I’m doing and why 
I’m doing it. I’m willing to follow 
your lead in a lot of things, Bren, 
but this is not one of them.” 

“But — ” 

“No buts. Come, Mr. Bresnahan. 
Follow me.” 

The wife fell silent, but her gaze 
was troubled as she watched the two 
men vanish through the tiny lock. 
Bresnahan wondered what she would 
do. It was because he felt sure Ac 
would something that he hadn’t 
simply defied Weisanen. 

T he woman’s face was no happier 
when the compuiterman emerged 
alone and swam back to a point be- 
side her. Her husband was visible 
throu^ the port, outsized helmet 
removed, beckoning to her. 



For a moment Bresnahan had the ' 
hope that she would refuse to go. 
This faded as she swam slowly 
toward the sphere, occassionally 
looking back, removed the anchor 
in response to a gesture from the 
man inside, and disappeared through 
the lock. The vehicle began to drift 
upward, vegetation near it swirling 
in the water jets. Within a minute 
it had faded from view into the 
darkness. 

“Just what’s going on here?” Sil- 
bert’s voice was clear enough; the 
suit radios carried for a short dis- 
tance through water. “Where are 
they going, and why?” 

“You didn’t hear any of my talk 
with Weisanen?” 

“No. I was busy, and it’s hard to 
get sound through this helmet any- 
way. What happened? Did you argue 
with him?” 

“In a way.” Bresnahan gave the 
story as concisely as he could. His 
friend’s whistle sounded eerily ia 
the confines of his helmet. 

“This — is — really — some- 
thing. Just for the record, young pal, 
we are in a serious jam, I hope you 
realize.” 

“I don’t think so. His wife is 
against the idea, and he’ll let him- 
self get talked out of it — ^he’s a 
little afraid of the results already.” 

“Not the point. It doesn’t matter 
if the whole thing was a practical 
joke on his part. They’re out of 
sight, in a medium where no cur- 
rent charts exist and the only navi- 
gation aids are that sphere’s awn 
sonar units. He covdd find his way 
back to the core, but how could ha 
find Of?” 



RAINDROP 




"Aren’t we right under the lock 
aad the station? We came straight 
down,” 

“Don’t bet on that. I told you — 
there are currents. If we made a 
ttraight track on the trip down here 
m be the most surprised man in- 
side Luna’s orbit. There are twenty 
million square feet on this mud- 
ball. We’d be visible from a radius 
of maybe two hundred — visible 
and recognizable, that is, with our 
tights on. That means they have 
something like two hundred search 
blocks, if my mental arithmetic is 
right, without even a means of 
knowing when they cover a given 
one a second time. There is a 
chance they’d find us, but not a 
good one — not a good enough one 
so that we should bet your chance 
of dodging a couple of weeks of 
weightlessness on it. When that nut 
went out of sight, he disposed of 
us once and for all.” 

“I wouldn’t call him a nut,” 
Bresnahan said. 

“Why not? Anyone who would 
leave a couple people to starve or get 
loaded with zero-gee symptoms on 
the odd chance that they might blab 
his favorite scheme to the public — ” 

“He’s a little unbalanced at the 
moment, but not a real nut. I’m 
sure he didn’t realize he’d passed 
the point of no return. Make allow- 
ances, Bert; I can. Some of my best 
friends are married, and I’ve seen 
’em when they first learned a kid 
was on the way. It’s just that they 
don’t usually have this good a chance 
to get other people in trouble; 
they’re all off the beam for a little 
while.” 



i^'l^ou’re the most tolerant and 
I civilized character I’ve met, 
and you’ve just convinced me that 
there can be too much of even the 
best of things. For my money the 
guy is a raving nut. More to the 
point, unless we can get ourselves 
out of the jam he’s dropped us into, 
we’re worse than nuts. We’re dead.” 
“Maybe he’ll realize the situation 
and go back to the station and call 
for help.” 

“There can be such a thing as 
too much optimism, too. My young 
friend, he’s not going to get to the 
station.” 

“What? Why not?” 

“Because the only laser tube not 
already in the station able to trigger 
the cobweb launchers is right here 
on my equipment clip. That’s anoth- 
er reason I think he’s a nut. He 
should have thought of that and 
pried it away from me somehow.” 
“Maybe it just means he wasn’t 
serious about the whole thing.” 
“Never mind what it means about 
him. Whatever his intentions. I’d 
be willing to wait for him to come 
back to us with his tail between his 
legs if I thought he could find us. 
Since I don’t think he can, we’d 
better get going ourselves.” 

“Huh? How?” 

“Swim. How else?*^ 

“But how do we navigate? Once 
we’re out of sight of the core we’d 
be there in the dark with absolutely 
nothing to guide us. These little 
lights on our suits aren’t — ” 

“I know they aren’t. That wasn’t 
the idea. Don’t worry; I may not 
be able to swim in a straight line, 
bi^ 1 can get us to surface even-

tually. Come on; five miles is a 
long swim.” 

Silbert started away from the 
glow, and Bresnahan followed un- 
easily. He was not happy at the 
prospect of weightlessness and dark- 
ness combined; the doses on the trip 
down, when at least the sphere had 
been present for some sort of ori- 
entation, had been more than suffi- 
cient. 

T ^he glow of the core faded slowly 
behind them, but before it was 
too difficult to see Silbert stopped. 

“All right, put your light on. Til 
do the same; stay close to me.” 
Bresnahan obeyed both orders glad- 
ly. “Now, watch.” 

The spaceman manipulated "Valves 
on his suit, and carefully ejected a 
bubble of air about two feet in dia- 
meter. “You noticed that waste gas 
from the electrolyzers in the diving 
suits didn’t stay with us to be a 
nuisance. The bubbles drifted away, 
even when we were at the core,” he 
pointed out. Bresnahan hadn’t no- 
ticed, since he wasn’t used to paying 
attention to the fate of the air he 
exhaled, but was able to remember 
the fact once it was mentioned. 

“That of course, was not due to 
buoyancy; so close to the core. The 
regular convection currents started 
by solar heat at the skin must be 
responsible. Therefore, those cur- 
rents must extend all the way be- 
tween skin and core. We’ll follow 
this bubble.” 

“If the current goes all the way, 
why not just drift?” 

“For two reasons. One is that 
the currents are slow — judging 



by their speed near the skin, the 
cycle must take over a day. Once we 
get away from the core, the buoy- 
ancy of this bubble will help; we 
can swim after it. 

“The other reason is that if we 
simply drift we might start down 
again with the current before we 
got close enough to the skin to see 
daylight. 

“Another trick we might try if 
this takes too long is to have one of 
us drift while the other follows the 
bubble to the limit of vision. That 
would establish the up-down line, 
and we could swim in that direc- 
tion for a while and then repeat. 
I’m afraid we probably couldn’t hold 
swimming direction for long enough 
to be useful, though, and it would 
be hard on the reserve air supply. 
We’d have to make a new bubble 
each time we checked. These suits 
have recyclers, but a spacesuit isn’t 
built to get its oxygen from the sur- 
rounding water the way that diving 
gear is.” 

“Let’s just follow this bubble,” 
Bresnahan said fervently. 

At first, of course, the two mere- 
ly drifted. There simply was no de- 
tectable buoyancy near the core. 
However, in a surprisingly short 
time the shimmering globule of gas 
began to show a tendency to drift 
away from them. 

The direction of drift was seldom 
the one which Bresnahan was think- 
ing of as “up” at the moment, but 
the spaceman nodded approval and 
carefully followed their only guide. 
Bresnahan wished that his train- 
ing had given him more confidence 
in instrument readings as opposed

to his own senses, but followed Sil- 
bert hopefully. 

EX 

T he fourteen hours he spent drift- 
ing weightless in the dark made 
m experience Bresnahan was never 
to forget, and his friends were never 
lo ignore. He always liked crowds 
afterward, and preferred to be in 
cities or at least buildings where 
straight, clearly outlined walls, win- 
dows, and doors marked an unequiv- 
ocal up-and-down direction. 

Even Silbert was bothered. He 
was more used to weightlessness, 
but the darkness he was used to 
seeing around him at such times was 
normally pocked with stars which 
provide orientation. The depths of 
Raindrop provided nothing. Both 
men were almost too far gone to be- 
lieve their senses when they finally 
realized that the bubble they were 
still following could be seen by a 
glow not from their suits lights. 

It was a faintly blue-green illumi- 
nation, still impossible to define as 
to source, but unmistakably sun- 
light filtered through hundreds of 
feet of water. Only minutes later 
their helmets met the tough, elastic 
skin of the satellite. 

It took Silbert only a few mo- 
ments to orient himself. The sun 
and the station were both visible — 
at least they had not come out on 
the opposite side of the satellite — 
and he knew the time. The first and 
last factors were merely checks; all 
that was really necessary to find 
the lock was to swim toward the 
point under the oMtiag atation. 



“I don’t want to use the sonar 
locater unless I have to,” he point- 
ed out. “There is sonar gear on the 
sphere. I should be able to get us 
close enough by sighting on the 
station so that the magnetic com- 
pass will work. Judging by where 
the station seems to be, we have 
four or five miles to swim. Let’s get 
going.” 

“And let’s follow the great cir- 
cle course,” added Bresnahan. 
“Never mind cutting across inside 
just because it’s shorter. I’ve had 
all I ever want of swimming in the 
dark.” 

“My feeling exactly. Come on.” 

The distance was considerably 
greater than Silbert had estimated, 
since he was not used to doing his 
sighting from under water and had 
not allowed for refraction; but final- 
ly the needle of the gimballed com- 
pass showed signs of making up its 
mind, and with nothing wrong that 
food and sleep would not repair the 
two men came at last in sight of 
the big lock cylinder. 

For a moment, Silbert wondered 
whether they should try to make 
their approach secretly. Then he 
decided that if the Weisanens were 
there waiting for them the effort 
would be impractical, and if they 
weren’t it would be futile. 

He simply swam up to the small 
hatch followed by Bresnahan, and 
they entered the big chamber to- 
gether. It proved to be full of water, 
but the sphere was nowhere in sight. 
With no words they headed for the 
outer personnel lock, entered it, 
pumped back the water, and emerged 
mi Raindrop’s surface. Silbert used

Ms laser, and ten minutes later they 
were inside the station. Bresnahan’s 
)amp had been a little more skillful 
than before. 

it"VTow let’s get on the radiol” 
snapped Silbcrt as he shed 
his space helmet. 

“Why? Whom would you call, 
and what would you tell them? Re- 
member that our normal Earth-end 
contacts are part of the same group 
the Weisanens belong to, and you 
can’t issue a general broadcast to 
^e universe at large screaming 
about a plot against mankind in 
die hope that someone will take you 
seriously. Someone might.” 

“But — ” 

“My turn, Bert. You’ve turned 
what I still think was just a poten- 
tially tragic mistake of Weisanen’s 
mto something almost funny, and 
incidentally saved both our lives. 
Now will you follow my lead? 
Things could still be serious if we 
«lon’t follow up properly.” 

“But what arc you going to do?” 
“You’ll see. Take it from me, com- 
promise is still possible. It will take 
a little time; Aino Weisanen will 
have to learn something I can’t teach 
him myself. Tell me, is there any 
way to nlonitor what goes on in 
Raindrop? For example, can you 
tell from here when the lock down 
diere is opened, so we would know 
when they come back.” 

“No.” 

“Then we’ll just have to watch 
for them. 1 assume that if we see 
Ihem, we can call them from here 
en regular radio.” 

“Of course.” 



“Then let’s eat, sleep, and wait 
They’ll be back after a while, and 
when they come Aino will listen 
to reason, believe me. But we can 
sleep right now. I’m sure; it will be 
a while yet before they show up. 
They should still be looking for 
us — getting more worried by the 
minute.” 

“Why should they appear at all? 
They must have found but long ago 
that they can’t get back to the sta- 
tion on their own. They obviously 
haven’t found us, and won’t. May- 
be they’ve simply decided they’re 
already fugitive murderers and have 
settled down to a permanent life m 
Raindrop.” 

“That’s possible, I suppose. Well, 
if we don’t see them in a couple of 
weeks, we can go back down and 
give them a call in some fashion. 
Fd rather they came to us, though, 
and not too soon. 

“But let’s forget that; I’m starved. 
What’s in your culture tanks be- 
sides liver?” 

X 

I t did not take two weeks. Nine 
days and eight hours after the 
men had returned to the station, 
Silbert saw two spacesuited figures 
standing on the lock half a mile 
away, and called his companion’s at- 
tention to them. 

“They must be desperate by this 
time,” remarked Bresnahan. “We’d 
better call them before they decide 
to risk the jump anyway.” He acti- 
vated the transmitter which Silbert 
indicated, and spoke. 

“Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Weisanen. 



lAJKDROP

Do you want us to send the cobweb 
down?” 

The voice that answered was fe- 
male. 

''Thank God you’re there I Yes, 
please. We’d like to come up for a 
while.” Silbert expected some quali- 
fying remarks from her husband, 
but none were forthcoming. At 
Bresnahan’s gesture, he activated the 
spring gun which launched the web 
toward the satellite. 

"Maybe you’d better suit up and 
go meet them,” suggested the coin- 
puterman. "I don’t suppose either 
of them is very good at folding 
the web, to say nothing of killing 
angular speed.” 

"I’m not sure I care whether they 
go off on their own orbit anyway,” 
growled the spaceman rising with 
some reluctance to his feet. 

"Still bitter? And both of them?” 
queried Bresnahan. 

"Well — I suppose not. And it 
would take forever to repair the 
web if it hit the station unfolded. 
I’ll be back.” Silbert vanished 
toward the hub, and the younger 
man turned back to watch his em- 
ployers make the leap from Rain- 
drop. He was not too surprised to 
see them hold hands as they did so, 
with the natural result that they 
spun madly on the way to the web 
and came close to missing it alto- 
gether. 

When his own stomach had stop- 
ped whirling in sympathy, he de- 
cided that maybe the incident was 
for the best. Anything which tend- 
ed to cut down Weisanen’s self-as- 
surance should be helpful, even 
though there was good reason to 



suspect tlhi; ’ c battle was already 
won. He wondered whether he 
should summon the pair to his and 
Silhert’s quarters for the interview 
which was about to ensue, but de- 
cided that there was such a thing 
as going too far. 

He awaited the invitation to the 
Weisanens’ rooms with eagerness. 

I t came within minutes of the cou- 
ple’s arrival at the air lock. When 
Bresnahan arrived he found Silbert 
already in the room where they had 
first reported on their brief visit to 
Raindrop. All three were still in 
spaces nits; they had removed only 
the helmets. 

'‘We’re going back down as soon 
as possible, Mr. Bresnahan,” Weis- 
anen began without preliminary. "I 
have a rather lengthy set of mes- 
sages here which I would like yon 
and Mr. Silbert to transmit as soon 
as possible. You will note that they 
contain my urgent recommendation 
for a policy change. Your sugges- 
tion of starting construction of small- 
er farms from Raindrop’s outer lay- 
ers is sound, and I think the Com- 
pany will follow it. I am also ad- 
vising that material be collected from 
the vicinity of the giant planets — 
Saturn’s rings seem a likely source 
— for constructing additional satel- 
lites like Raindrop as private under- 
takings. Financing can be worked 
out. There should be enough profit 
from the farms, and that’s the logi- 
cal direction for some of it to flow. 

"Once other sources of farm ma- 
terial are available. Raindrop will 
not be used further for the purpose. 
It will serve as Company headquar- 



44 



IF 




ters — ^it win be more convenient 
to have that in orbit anyway. The 
closest possible commercial relations 
are to be maintained with Earth.” 
“I’m glad you feel that way, sir,” 
replied Bresnahan. “We’ll get the 
messages off as soon as possible. I 
take it that morc^ of the Company’s 
officials will be coming up here to 
live, then?” 

“Probably all of them, within the 
next two years or so. Brenda and I 
will go back and resume surveying 
now, as soon as we stock up with 
tome food. I’ll be back occasional- 
ly, but I’d rather she kept away 
from high weight for the next few 
months, as you know.” 

“Yes, sir,” Bresnahan managed, 
by a heroic effort, to control his 
tmile — almost. Weisanen saw the 
flicker of his lip, and froze for a 
moment. Then his own sober fea- 
tures loosened into a broad grin. 

“Maybe another hour won’t hurt 
Brenda,” he remarked. “Let’s have 
a meal together before we go back.” 
He paused, and added almost dif- 
fidently. “Sorry about what hap- 
pened. We’re human, you know.” 
“I know,” replied Bresnahan. 
“That’s what I was counting on.” 

44 4 nd that,” remarked Silbert as 
he shed his helmet, “is that 
They’re aboard and bound for the 



core again, happy as clams. And 
speaking of clams, if you don’t tell 
me why that stubborn Finn changed 
his mind, and why you were so 
sure he’d do it there’ll be mayhem 
around here. Don’t try to make me 
believe that he got scared about 
what he’d nearly done to us. I 
know his wife was on our side, 
basically, but she wasn’t about to 
wage open war for us.' She was as 
worried about their kid as he was. 
Come on; make with the words, 
chum.” 

“Simple enough. Didn’t you no- 
tice what he wanted before going 
back to Raindrop?” 

“Not particularly — oh; food. 
So what? He could live on the food 
down there — or couldn’t he? Don’t 
you believe what he said?” 

“Sure I believe him. He and his 
wife can digest cellulose, Heaven 
help them, and they can live off 
Raindrop’s seaweed. As I remarked 
to him, though — you heard me, 
and he understood me — they’re hu- 
man. I can digest kale and cauli- 
flower, too, and could probably live 
off them as well as that pair could 
live off the weeds. But did you ever 
stop to think what the stuff must 
taste like? Neither did they. I knew 
they’d be back with open mouths 
— and open minds. Let’s eat — 
anything but Hver!” END

IF 9 Short Story 



Guesting Time 

by R. A. LAFFERTY 



Things were a bit crowded 
where they came from — and 
were getting that way herel 



W inston, the Civil Servant in 
Immigration and Arrivals, 
was puzzled when he came that 
morning. There were several hun- 
dred new people behind the cyclone 
fences, and no arrivals had been 
scheduled. 

‘‘What ships landed?” he called 
out. “Why were they unscheduled?” 
“No ships landed, sir,” said Pot- 
holder, the senior guard. 

“Then how did these people get 
here? Walk down from the sky?” 
Winston asked snappishly. 

“Yes, sir, I guess so. We don’t 
know who they are or how they 
keep coming here. They say they 
SLve from Skandia.” 

“We have few Scandanavian ar- 
rivals, and none of such appearance 
as this,” said Winston. “How many 
are there?” 

“Well, sir, when we first noticed 



them there were seven, and they 
hadn’t been there a moment be- 
fore.” 

“Seven? You’re crazy. There are 
hundreds.” 

“Yes, sir. I’m crazy. A minute af- 
ter there were seven, there were sev- 
enteen. But no more had come from 
anywhere. Then there were sixty. 
We separated them into groups of 
ten and watched them very closely. 
None crossed from one group to an- 
other, none came from anywhere 
else. But soon there were fifteen, 
then twenty-five, then thirty in each 
group. And there’s a lot more of 
them there now than when you 
started to talk to me a moment ago, 
Mr. Winston.” 

“Corcoran is my superior and will 
be here in a minute,” Winston said. 
“He’ll know what to do.” 

“Mr. Corcoran left just before

you arrived, sir,” said Pothokler. 
*^He watched it a while, and then 
went away babbling.” 

always admired his quick grasp 
of a situation,” said Winston. He 
also went away babbling. 

T here were about a thousand of 
those Skandia people, and a 
little later there were nine times that 
many. They weren’t dowdy people, 
but the area wouldn’t hold any 
more. The fences all went down, 
and the Skandias spread out into 
the city and towns and country. 
This was only the beginning of it 
About a million of them mater- 
ialized there that morning, then the 
same thing happened at ten thou- 
sand other Ports of Entry of Earth. 

“Mama,” said Trixie, “there are 
some people here who want to use 
our bathroom.” This was Beatrice 
(Trixie) Trux, a little girl in the 
small town of Winterfield. 

“What an odd request!” said Mrs. 
Trux. “But I suppose it is in the 
nature of an emergency. Let them 
in, Trixie. How many people are 
there?” 

“About a thousand,” said Trixie. 
“Trixie, there can’t be that 
many.” 

“All right, you count them.” 

All the people came in to use the 
Trux’s bathroom. There were some- 
what more than a thousand of them, 
and it took them quite a while to 
use the bathroom even though they 
put a fifteen-second limit on each 
one and had a timekeeper with a 
bell to enforce it. They did it 
with a lot of laughter and carry- 
ing on, but it took that first bun^ 



about five hours to go through, and 
by that time there were a lot more 
new ones waiting. 

“This is a little unusual,” Mrs. 
Trux said to some of the Skandia 
women. “I was never short on hos- 
pitality. It is our physical resources, 
not our willingness, that becomes 
strained. There are so many of 
you!” 

“Don’t give it a thought,” the 
Skandia women said. “It is the in- 
tent that countt, and it was so kind 
of you people to invite us. We sel- 
dom get a chance to go anywhere. 
We came a little early, but the main 
bunch will be along very soon. 
Don’t you just love to go visiting.” 
“Oh, yes, yes,” said Mrs. Trux. 
“I never realized till now just how 
much 1 wanted to go visiting.” 

But when she saw the whole out- 
doors black with the new people, 
Mrs. Trux decided that she had bet- 
ter stay where she was. 

T ruman Trux was figuring witfc 
a pencil. 

“Our lot is fifty feet by a hun- 
dred and fifty feet, Jessica,” he 
said. “That is either 7,500 or 75,000 
square feet depending on how many 
zeroes you carry it out to.” 

“You were always good at math,** 
said Mrs. Trux. “How do you do il 
anyhow?** 

“And do you know how many 
people are living with us here on 
this lot, Jessica?” Truman asked. 
“Quite a few.** 

“I am guessing between six and 
seven thousand,” said Truman. “I 
found several more blocks of them 
fins morning that I didn’t know

about. Hiey have a complete city 
built in our back yard. The streets 
are two and a half feet wide; the 
houses are eight feet by eight feet 
with six foot ceilings, and most of 
them are nine stories high. Whole 
families live in each room and cook 
there besides. They have shops and 
bazaars set up. They even have fac- 
tories built. I know there is an en- 
tire wholesale textile district in our 
back yard. There are thirteen tav- 
erns and five music halls in our 
yard to my own knowledge, and 
there may be more.” 

“Well, some of those places are 
pretty small, Truman. The Little 
Hideout is in the broom closet of 
the Big Hideout, and I don’t know 
if we should count it as a separate 
tavern. You have to go into the 
Sideways Club sideways; the Thin- 
man Club is only nihe inches wide 
from wall to wall and it’s quite a 
trick to bending an elbow there; 
and the Mouse Room is small. But 
the better clubs are up in our attic, 
Truman. Did you ever count them? 
The Crazy Man Cabaret is up there, 
and the After Hours Club. Most of 
the other attic clubs are key clubs 
and I’m not a member. They’ve set 
up the Skandia Art Theatre in our 
basement now you know. They have 
continuous performances.” 

“I know it, Jessica, I know it.” 
“Their comedies are so funny that 
1 nearly die. The trouble is that it’s 
so crowded there that you have to 
laugh in when the one next to you 
laughs out. And I cry just like they 
do at their tragedies. They’re all 
about women who can’t have any 
more chfldren. Why don’t we have 



a bunch more, Truman? Thera^ 
more than twenty shops in our yard 
where they sell nothing but fertility 
charms. I wonder why there arenH 
any children with the Skandia?” 

“Ah, they say that this is just a 
short first visit by a few of them 
and they didn’t presume to bring 
their children with them. What is 
that new racket superimposed on 
the old?” 

“Oh, that’s the big drums and the 
cymbals. They’re having a political 
campaign to elect temporary offi- 
cials for the time of their visit here. 
Imperial City, that’s the town in our 
yard and our house, will elect dele- 
gates to go to the Congress to repre- 
sent this whole block. The elections 
will be tonight. Then we’ll really 
hear some noise, they say. The big 
drums don’t really waste space, Tru- 
man. There are people inside them 
and they play them from the inside. 
Some of our neighbors are getting a 
little fussy about the newcomers, 
but I always did like a house full 
of people.” 

“We have it now, Jessica. I never 
got used to sleeping in a bed with 
nine other people, even if they are 
quiet sleepers. I like people, and 
I am fond of new experiences. But 
it is getting crowded.” 

“We have more of the Skandia 
than anyone else in the block ex- 
cept the Skirveys. They say it’s be- 
cause they like us more than some 
of the others. Mamie Skirvey is tak- 
ing four kinds of the fertility pills 
now. She is almost sure she will be 
able to have triplets. I want to too.” 

“All the stores are stripped, Jes- 
sica, and all the lumber yards and 



48 



IF 




lumber camps; and the grain eleva- 
tors will be empty in two more days. 
The Skandia pay for everything in 
money, but nobody knows what it 
says on it. I haven’t got used to 
walking on men and women when 
I go out, but there’s no avoiding it 
since the ground is covered with 
them.” 

“They don’t mind. They’re used 
to it. They say it’s crowded where 
they come from.” 

T he Winterfield Times-Tribune 
Telegraph had a piece about 
the Skandia: 

The plain fact is that for two 
days the Earth has had ten bil- 
lion visitors from Skandia, 
wherever that is. The plain fact 
is that the Earth will die of 
them within a week. They ap- 
pear by invisible transporta- 
tion, but they have shown no 
inclination to disappear in the 
same manner. Food will be 
gone, water will be gone, the 
very air we breathe will be 
gone. They speak all our lan- 
guages, they are polite, friend- 
ly and agreeable. And we will 
perish from them. 

A big smiling man broke in on 
Bar-Tohn, who was once again presi- 
dent of Big State Amalgamated, for- 
merly U. S. A. 

“I’m the president of the Skandia 
Visitation,” he boomed. “We have 
come partly to instruct you people 
and we find that you do need it. 
Your fertility rate is pathetic. You 
barely double in fifty years. Your 



medicine, adequate in other fields, 
is worse than childish in this. Wo 
find that some of the nostrums 
peddled to your people actually im- 
pede fertility. Well, get in the Sur- 
geon General and a few of the boys 
and we’ll begin to correct the situa- 
tion.” 

“Gedoudahere,” said President 
Bar-John. 

“1 know you will not want your 
people to miss out on the popula- 
tion blessing,” said the Skandia 
Visitation President. “We can aid 
you. We want you to be as happy as 
we are.” 

“Jarvis! Cudgelman! Sapsucker!* 
President Bar-John called out 
“Shoot down this man. I’ll imple- 
ment the paper work on it later.” 

“You always say that but you 
never do,” Sapsucker complained, 
“It’s been getting us in a lot of 
trouble.” 

“Oh, well, don’t shoot him dowa 
then if you’re going to make an is- 
sue of it. I long for the old days 
when the simple things were done 
simply. Dammit, you Skandia skinr 
ner, do you know that there are 
nine thousand of you in the White 
House itself?” 

“We intend to improve that this 
very hour,” the Skandia president 
said. “Wc can erect one, two, or 
even three decks in these high- 
ceilinged rooms. 1 am happy to say 
that we will have thirty thousand of 
our people quartered in the White 
House this night.” 

“Do you think I like to take a 
bath with eight other persons — not 
even registered voters — in the same 
tub?” President Bar-John complain-

ed. “Do you think I like to eat off 
a plate shared by three or four oth- 
er people? Or to shave, by mistake, 
faces other than my own in the 
morning?” 

“I don’t see why not,” said the 
Skandia Visitation President. “Peo- 
ple are our most precious commod- 
ity. Presidents are always chosen as 
being those who most love the peo- 
ple.” 

“Oh, come on, fellows,” said 
President Bar-John. “Shoot down 
the ever-loving son. We’re entitled 
to a free one now and then.” 

Jarvis and Cudgelman and Sap- 
sucker blazed away at the Skandia, 
but they harmed him not at all. 

“You should have known that 
we are immune to that,” the Skan- 
dia said. “We voted against its ef- 
fect years ago. Well, since you will 
not cooperate, I will go direct to 
your people. Happy increase to you, 
gentlemen.” 

T ruman Trux, having gone out 
from his own place for a little 
change, was sitting on a park bench. 

He wasn’t actually sitting on it, 
but several feet above it. In that 
particular place, a talkative Skan- 
dia lady sat on the bench itself. On 
her lap sat a sturdy Skandiaman 
reading the Sporting News and 
smoking . a pipe. On him sat a 
younger Skandia woman. Chi this 
younger woman sat Truman Trux, 
and on him sat a dark Skandia girl 
who was filing her fingernails and 
humming a tune. On her in turn sat 
an elderly Skandia man. As crowded 
as things had become, one could 
not expect a seat of one’s own. 



A fellow and his girl came along, 
walking on the people on the grass. 

“Mind if we get on?” asked the 
girl. 

“Quite all right,” said the elder- 
ly gentleman on top. “’Sail right,” 
said the girl working on her nails. 
“Certainly,” said Truman and the 
others, and the Sporting News man 
puffed into his pipe that it was per- 
fectly agreeable. 

There was no longer any motor 
traffic. People walked closely pack- 
ed on streets and sidewalks. The 
slow stratum was the lowest, then 
the medium (walking on the shoul- 
ders of the mediums and combining 
the three speeds). At crossings it 
became rather intricate, and people 
were sometimes piled nine high. But 
the Earth people, those who still 
went out, quickly got onto the Skan- 
dia techniques. 

An Earthman, known for his ex- 
treme views, had mounted onto i 
monument in the park and began 
to harangue the people. Earth and 
Skandia. Truman Trux, who wanted 
to see and hear, managed to get a 
nice fifth level seat, sitting on the 
shoulders of a nice Skandia girl, 
who sat on the shoulders of another 
who likewise to the bottom. 

“Ye are a plague of locusts!” 
howled the earth-side crank. “Ye 
have stripped us bare!” 

“The poor man!” said the Skan- 
dia girl who was Truman’s under- 
steady. “He likely has only a few 
children and is embittered.” 

“Ye have devoured our substance 
and stolen the very air of our life. 
Ye are the Apocalyptical grasshop- 
pers, the eleventh plague.”

“Here is a fertility charm for your 
wife,*’ said the Skandia girl, and 
reached it up to Truman. “You 
might not need it yet, but keep it 
for the future. It is for those who 
have more than twelve. The words 
in Skandia say ‘Why stop now?* It 
is very efficacious.” 

“Thank you,” said Truman. “My 
wife has many charms from you 
good people, but not one like this. 
We have only one child, a young 
girl.” 

“What a shame! Here is a charm 
for your daughter. She cannot be- 
gin to use them too early.” 

“Destruction, destruction, destruc- 
tion on ye all!*’ screamed the Earth- 
side crank from atop the monu- 
ment. 

“Quite an adept,” said the Skan- 
dia girl. “To what school of elo- 
quence does he belong?” 

The crowd began to break up and 
move off. Truman felt himself taken 
down one level and then another. 

“Any particular direction?” ask- 
ed the Skandia girl. 

“This is fine,” said Truman. 
“We’re going toward my home.” 
“Why, here’s a place fdmost 
clear,” said the girl. “You’d never 
find anything like this at home.” 
They were now down to the last 
level, the girl walking only on the 
horizontal bodies of those lounging 
on the grass. “You can get off and 
walk if you wish,” said the girl. 
“Here’s a gap in the walkers you 
can slip down into. Well, toodle.” 
“You mean toodle-oo?” Truman 
asked as he ^id off her shoulders. 

“That’s right. I can never remem- 
ber the last part of it” 



The Sflcandia were such friendlf* 
people! 

P resident Bar-John and a dozen 
other regents of the world had 
decided that bruskness was called 
for. Due to the intermingling of 
Earth and Skandia populations, this 
would be a task for small and me- 
dium arms. The problem would be 
to gather the Skandia together in 
open spots, but on the designated 
day they began to gather ot them- 
selves in a million parks and plazas 
of the Earth. It worked perfectly. 
Army units were posted everywhere 
and went into action. 

Rifles began to whistle and ma- 
chine guns to chatter. But the ef- 
fect on the Skandia was not that 
expected. 

Instead of falling wounded, they 
cheered everywhere. 

“Pyrotechnics yet!” exclaimed a 
Skan^a leader, mounting onto the 
monument in our own park. “Oh, 
we are honored!” 

But, though the Skandia did not 
fall from the gunshot, they had be- 
gun to diminish in their numbers. 
They were disappearing as mysteri- 
ously as they had appeared a week 
before. 

“We go now,” said the Skandia 
leader from the top of the monu- 
ment. “We have enjoyed every min- 
ute of our short visit. Do not de- 
spair! We will not abandon you to 
your emptiness. Our token force will 
return home and report. In another 
week we wiH visit you in substantial 
numbers. We will teach you the full 
happiness of human proximity, the 
glory of Crahfiilness, &e blessing of

adequate population. We will teach 
you to fill up the horrible empty 
places of your planet.” 

The Skandia were thinning out. 
The last of them were taking cheer- 
ing farewells of disconsolate Earth 
friends. 

“We will be back,” they said as 
they passed their last fertility 
charms into avid hands. “We’ll be 
back and teach you everything so 
you can be as happy as we are. 
Good increase to you!” 

“Good increase to you!” cried the 
Earth people to the disappearing 



Skandia. Oh, it would be a lone- 
some world without all those nice 
people! With them you had the 
feeling that they were really close 
to you. 

“We'll be back!” said the Skan- 
dia leader, and disappeared from 
the monument. “We’ll be back next 
the monument. 

“We’ll be back next week and a 
lot more of us,” and then they were 
gone. 

“ — And next time we’ll bring the 
kids!” came the last fading Skandia 
voice from the sky. END

SIGN OF HE Wlf 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 



ft struck like a wolf from 
out in space — and the men 
were chfenseless against iH 



T he dark shape, big as a man, 
come between the two smaikst 
of the three watchfires, moving in 
silence like that of sleep. Out of 
habit, Duncan had been watching 
that downwind direction, though 
his mind was heavy with tiredness 
and with the thoughts of life that 
came with sixteen summers’ age. 

Duncan raised his spear and howl- 
ed, and charged the wolf. For a mo- 
ment the fire-eyes looked stea<fily 
at him, appearmg to be a fidl hand 
apart. Then the wolf turned away; 
it made one deep questioning sound, 
and was gone into the darkness out 
beyond the fires. 

Duncan stopped, drawing a gasp- 
ing breath of relief. The wolf would 
probably have killed him if it had 



faced his diarge, but it did not yet 
dare to face him in firelight. 

The bleeps* eyes were on Duncan, 
a hundred gjowing spots in the hud- 
dled mass of the flock. One or two 
oi the animals bleated softly. 

He paced around the flock, sleep- 
iness and introspection jarred from 
his mind. Legends said that men 
in the old Earthland had animals 
called dogs that guarded sheep. If 
that were true, some might think 
that men were fools for ever leav- 
ing Earthland. 

But sudi thoughts were irreverent, 
and Duncan’s situation called for 
prayer. Every night now the wolf 
came, and all too often it killed a 
sheep. 

Duncan raised his eyes to the 



n 




Bight sky. ^'Send me a sign, star- 
gods,” he prayed, routinely. But 
Ihe heavens were quiet. Only the 
stately fireflies of the dawn zone 
traced their steady random paths, 
vanishing halfway up the eastern 
sky. The stars themselves agreed 
that three-fourths of the night was 
gone. The legends said that Earth- 
land was among the stars, but the 
younger priests admitted such a 
statement could only be taken sym- 
bolically. 

The heavy thoughts came back, 
in spite of the nearby wolf. For two 
years now Duncan had prayed and 
hoped for his mystical experience, 
the sign from a god that came to 
mark the future life of every youth. 
From what other young men whis- 
pered now and then, he knew that 
many faked their signs. That was 
all right for lowly herdsmen, or even 
for hunters. But how could a man 
without a genuine vision ever be 
much more than a tender of ani- 
mals? To be a priest, to study the 
things brought from old Earthland 
and saved — Duncan hungered for 
learning, for greatness, for things he 
could not name. 

He looked up again, and gasped, 
for he saw a great sign in the sky, 
almost directly overhead. A point of 
dazzling light, and then a bright 
little cloud remaining among the 
•tars. Duncan gripped his spear, 
watching, for a moment even for- 
getting the sheep. The tiny cloud 
•welled and faded very slowly. 

F or centuries now the berserker 
machines had warred on Earth- 
descended men. AoComatons loosed 



in some forgotten war, the machines 
moved as raiders through the galaxy, 
destroying whatever life they could 
find and overcome. 

One such machine slid out of the 
interstellar intervals toward Dun- 
can’s planet, drawn from afar by 
the Sol-type light of Duncan’s sun. 
To turn life into death was a ber- 
serker’s function, and this sun and 
this planet promised life. 

The berserker machine was the 
size of a small planetoid, and its 
power was immense, but it knew well 
that some planets were defended, 
and it bent and slowed its hurtling 
approach into a long cautious curve. 

There were no warships in near- 
by space, but the berserker’s tele- 
scopes picked out the bright dots of 
defensive satellites, vanishing into 
the planet’s shadow and reappear- 
ing. To probe for more data, the 
berserker computers loosed a spy 
missile. 

The missile looped the planet, and 
then shot in, testing the defensive 
net. Lx>w over nightside, it turned 
suddenly into a bright little cloud. 

Still, defensive satellites formed 
no real obstacle to a berserker. It 
could gobble them up almost at 
leisure if it moved in close to them, 
though they would stop long-range 
missiles fired at the planet. It was 
the other things the planet might 
have, the buried things, that held 
the berserker back from a killing 
rush. 

Also it was strange that this de- 
fended planet had no cities to make 
light sparks on its nightside, and 
that no radio signals came from it in- 
to space.

IF 




With mechanical caution the ber- 
serker moved in, toward the area 
scouted by the spy missile. 

I n the morning, Duncan counted 
his flock — and then recounted, 
already scowling. Then he search- 
ed until he found the slaughtered 
lamb. The wolf had not gone hun- 
gry after all. That made four sheep 
lost, now, in ten days. 

Duncan tried to tell himself that 
dead sheep no longer mattered so 
much to him, that with a sign such 
as he had been granted last night his 
life was going to be filled with great 
deeds and noble causes. But the 
sheep still did matter, and not only 
because their owners would be 
angry. 

Looking up sullenly from the 
eaten lamb, he saw a brown-robed 
priest, alone, mounted on a donkey, 
climbing the long grassy slope of 
the grazing valley from the direction 
of the Temple Village. He would be 
going to pray in one of the Caves 
in the foot of the mountain at the 
head of the valley. 

At Duncan’s beckoning wave — 
he could not leave the flock to walk 
far toward the priest — the man 
on the donkey changed course. Dun- 
can walked a little way to meet 
him. 

“Blessings of Earthland,” said the 
priest shortly, when he came close. 
He was a stout man who seemed 
glad to dismount and stretch, arch- 
ing his back and grunting. 

He smiled as he saw Duncan’s 
hesitation. “Are you much alone 
here, my son?” 

“Yes, Holy One. But — last 



night, I had a sign. For two years 
I’ve wanted one, and just last night 
it came.” 

“Indeed? That is good news.” The 
priest’s eyes strayed to the mountain, 
and to the sun, as if he calculated 
how mucii time he oould spare. But 
he said, with no sound of impati- 
ence: “Tell me about it, if you 
wish.” 

When he heard that the flash in 
the sky was Duncan’s sign, the priest 
frowned. Then he seemed to keep 
himself from smiling. “My son, that 
light was seen by many. Today the 
elders of a dozen villages, of most of 
the Tribe, have come to the Temple 
Village. Everyone has seen some- 
thing different in the sky-flash, and 
I am now going to pray in a Cave, 
because of it.” 

The priest remounted, but when 
he had looked at Duncan again, he 
waited to say: “Still, I was not one 
of those chosen to see the sky-gods* 
sign; and you were. It may be a 
sign for you as well as for others, 
so do not be disappointed if it is 
not only for you. Be faithful in 
your duties and signs will come.” 
He turned the donkey away. 

Feeling small, Duncan walked 
slowly back to hk flock. How could 
he have thought that a light seen 
over half the world was meant for 
one shepherd? Now his sign was 
gone, but his wolf remained. 

I n the afternoon, another figure 
came into sight, walking straight 
toward the flock from the direction 
of Colleen’s village. Duncan tight- 
ened the belt on his woolen tunic, 
and combed grass from his hair with 



SIGN OF THE WOLF 



5S 




Us fingers. He felt his chin, and 
wished his beard would really begin 
to grow. 

He was sure the visitor was Col- 
ken when she was still half a mile 
away. He kept his movements calm 
and made himself appear to first 
notice her when she came in sight 
on a hilltop within hailing distance. 
The wind moved her brown hair and 
her garments. 

“Hello, Colleen.” 

“Hello, Duncan the Herdsman. 
My father sent me to ask about his 
sheep.” 

He ran an anxious eye over the 
flock, picking out individuals. Praise 
be to gods of land and sky. “Your 
father’s sheep are well.” 

She walked closer to him. “Here 
are some cakes. The other sheep are 
not well?” 

Ah, she was beautiful. But no 
mere herdsman would ever have her. 

“Last night the wolf killed again.” 
Duncan gestured with empty hands. 

“I watch, I light fires. I have a 
•pear and a club, and I rush at 
him when he comes, and I drive 
him away. But sooner or later he 
comes on the wrong side of the 
flock, or a sheep strays.” 

“Another man should come from 
the village,” she said. “Even a boy 
would help. With a big clever wolf, 
any herdsman may need help.” 

He nodded, faintly pleased at her 
implying he was a man. But his 
troubles were too big to be soothed 
away. “Did you see the sky-flash, 
last night?” he asked, remembering 
with bitterness his joy when he had 
thought the sign was his. 

“No, but all the village is talking 

U 



about it. I will tell them about the 
wolf, but probably no man will come 
to help you for a day or two. They 
are all dancing and talking, think- 
ing of nothing but the sky-flash.” 
She raised puzzled eyes beyond Dun- 
can. “Look.” 

It was the priest, rushing past half 
a mile from them on his way Jown 
valley from the Caves, doing his 
best to make his donkey gallop 
toward the Temple Village. 

“He may have met your wolf,” 
Colleen suggested. 

“He doesn’t look behind him. 
Maybe in the Caves he received an 
important sign from the earth-gods.” 

They talked a while longer, sitting 
on the grass while he ate the jakes 
she had brought him. 

“1 must go!” She sprang up. The 
sun was lowering and neither of 
them had realized it. 

“Yes, hurry! At night the wolf 
may be anywhere on the plain.” 

Watching her hurry away, Duncan 
felt the wolf in his own blood. Per- 
haps she knew it, for she looked back 
at him strangely from the hilltop. 
Then she was gone. 

O n a hillside, gathering dried 
brush for the night’s watch- 
fires, Duncan paused for a moment, 
looking at the sunset. 

“Sky-gods, help me,” he prayed. 
“And earth-gods, the dark wolf 
should be under your dominion. If 
you will not grant me a sign, at 
least help me deal with the wolf.” 
He bent routinely and laid his ear 
to a rock. Every day he asked some 
god for a sign, but never — 

He heard a voice. He crouched 

IF 




there, listening to the rock, unable 
to believe. Surely it was a waterfall 
he heard, or running cattle some- 
where near. But no, it was a real 
voice, booming and shouting in some 
buried distance. He could not make 
out the words, but it was a real 
god-voice from under the earth. 

He straightened up, tears in his 
eyes, even the sheep for a moment 
forgotten. This wonderful sign was 
not for half the world, this was for 
him! And he had doubted that it 
would ever come. 

To hear what it said was all- 
important. He bent again and 
listened. The muffled voice went on 
unceasingly, but he could not under- 
stand it. He ran a few steps up the 
hill, and put his ear against another 
exposed earth-bone of rock. Yes, the 
voice was plainer here; sometimes 
he could distinguish a word. “Give,” 
said the voice. Mumble, mumble. 
“Defend,” he thought it said. Even 
the words he recognized where spo- 
ken in strange accents. 

He realized that darkness was 
falling, and stood up, in fearful in- 
decision. The sheep were itill his 
responsibility, and he had to Ught 
watchfires, he had to, for the sheep 
would be slaughtered without them. 
And at the same time he had to 
listen to this voice. 

A form moved toward him 
through the twilight, and he grab- 
bed up his club — then he realized 
it was Colleen. 

She looked frightened. She whis- 
pered: “The sun went down, and I 
feared the dark. It was a shorter 
way back to you, than on to the 
village.” 



The berserker moved in toward 
the nightside of the planet, quickly 
now, but still with caution. It had 
searched its memory of thousands of 
years of war against a ihoLisarid kinds 
of life, and it had remembered one 
other planet like this, with defen- 
sive satellites but no cities or radios. 
The fortifiers of that planet had 
fought among themselves^ weakening 
until they could no longer operate 
their defenses, had even forgotten 
what their planet-weapons were. 

The life here might be shamming, 
trying to lure the berserker within 
range of the planet-weapons. There- 
fore the berserker sent its mechani- 
cal scouts ahead, to break througii 
the satellite net, and range ovcf 
the land surface, killing, until they 
provoked the planet’s maximum re- 
sponse. 

T ^he fires were built, and Colleen 
held the spear and watched the 
sheep. Wolf or not, Duncan had te 
follow his sign. He made his way 
up the dark hillside, listening at rock 
after rock. And ever the earth-god 
voice grew stronger. 

In the back of his mind Duncaa 
realized that Colleen had arranged to 
be trapped with him for the night, 
to help him defend the sheep, and 
he felt limitless gratitude and love. 
But even that was now in the back 
of his mind. The voice now was 
everything. 

He held his breath, listening. Now 
he could hear the voice while he 
stood erect. There, ahead, at the 
foot of a cliff, were slabs of rock 
tumbled down by snowslides. Among 
them mig}it be a cave. 



SIGN OF THE WOLF 



37 




He reached the slabs, and heard 
the voice rumble up between them. 
“Attack in progress. Request human 
response. Order one requested. This 
is defense control. Attack in pro- 
gress — ” 

On and on it went. Duncan un- 
derstood some of it. Attack, request, 
human. Order one requested — that 
must mean one wish was to be 
granted, as in the legends. Never 
again would Duncan laugh at 
legends, thinking himself wise. This 
was no prank of the other young 
men; no one could hide in a cave 
and shout on and on in such a 
voice. 

No one but a priest should enter 
a cave, but probably not even the 
priests knew of this one. It was 
Duncan’s, for his sign had led him 
here. He had been granted a tre- 
mendous sign. 

More awed than fearful, he slid 
between slabs of rock, finding the 
way down, rock and earth and then 
metal under his feet. He dropped 
Into a low metal cave. It was as he 
had heard the god-caves described, 
very long, smooth, round and regu- 
lar, except here where it was bent 
and tom under the fallen rocks. In 
the cave’s curving sides were glow- 
ing places, like huge animal eyes, 
giving light enough to see. 

And here the shouting was very 
loud. Duncan moved toward it. 

We have reached the surface, the 
scouts radioed back to the berser- 
ker, in their passionless computer- 
symbol language. Here intelligent 
life of the earth-type lives in villages. 
So far we have killed eight hundred 
and thirty-nine units. We have met 



no response from dangeruu^ wc; j- 
ons. 

A little while the berserker wait- 
ed, letting the toll of life-units 
mount. When the chance of this 
planet’s being a trap had dropped in 
computer-estimation to the vanish- 
ing point, the berserker moved in 
to close range, and began to mop the 
remaining defensive satellites out of 
its way. 

44 Y Tere 1 am.” Duncan fell on 
XA his knees before the metal 
thing that bellowed. In front of the 
god-shape lay woven twigs and 
eggshells, so old as to be hardly 
more than dust. Once priests had 
sacrificed here, and then they haJ 
forgotten this god. 

“Here I am,” said Duncan again, 
in a louder voice. 

The god heeded him, for the 
deafening shouting stopped. 

“Response acknowledged, from 
defense control alternate 9,864,” said 
the god. “Planetary defenses now 
under control of post 9,864.” 

How could you ask a god to speak 
naore plainly? 

After a little time of silence, the 
god said: “Request order one.” 
That seemed understandable, but 
to make sure, Duncan asked: “You 
will grant me one wish, mighty one?” 
“Will obey your order. Emer- 
gency. Satellite sphere ninety per 
cent destroyed. Planet-weapon re- 
sponses fully programmed, activation 
command requested.” 

Duncan, still kneeling, closed his 
eyes. One wish would be granted. 
TTie rest of the words he took for 
a warning to choose his wish with 



58 



IF 




atre. If he wished, the god would 
make him the wisest of chiefs, or 
Ihe bravest of warriors. The god 
would give him a hundred years of 
fife, or a dozen young wives. 

Or Colleen. 

But Colleen was out in the dark- 
less, now, facing the wolf. Even 
BOW the wolf might be prowling 
Bear, just beyond the circles of fire- 
fight, watching the sheep, and watch- 
lag the tender girl. Even now Col- 
leen might be screaming — 

Duncan’s heart sank utterly, for 
he knew the wolf had beaten him, 
had destroyed this moment on which 
Ac rest of his life depended. He 
was a herdsman. And if he could 
make himself forget the sheep, he 
could not want to forget Colleen. 

“Destroy the wolf! Kill it!” he 
dioked out. 

“Term wolf questioned.” 

“The killer! To destroy the killer! 
That is the only wish I can make!” 
He could stand the presence of the 
god no longer, and ran away through 
the cave, weeping for his ruined 
fife. He ran to find Colleen. 

R ecall, shouted the electronic 
voice of the berserker. Trap. 
Recall. Hearing, its scattered bro^ 
of scout machines rose at top ac- 
celeration from their planet work, 
curving and climbing toward their 
great metal mother. Too slow. They 
blurred into streaks, into fireworks 
of incandescent gas. 

The berserker was not waiting for 
them, it was diving for deep s^ace, 
knowing the planet- weapons reached 
out for it. It wasted no circuits now 
to compute why so much life had 



been sacrificed to trap it. It saw 
new force fields thrown up ahead 
of it, walling it in. No escape. 

The whole sky was in flames, the 
bones of the hills shuddered under- 
foot, and at the head of the valley 
the top of the mountain was torn 
away and an enormous shaft of 
something almost invisible poured 
from it infinitely up into the sky. 

Duncan saw (Eileen huddling on 
the open ground, shouting to him, 
but the buried thunder drowned her 
voice. The sheep were running and 
leaping, crying under the terrible 
sky. Duncan saw the dark wolf 
among them, running with them in 
circles, too frightened to be a wolf. 
He picked up his club and ran, 
staggering with the shaking earth, 
after the beast. 

He caught the wolf, for he ran 
toward it, while it ran in circles 
without regard for him. He saw the 
sky reflected in its eyes, facing him, 
and he swung his club just as it 
crouched to leap. 

He won. And then he struck again 
and again, making sure. 

All at once there was a blue-white, 
moving sun in the sky, a marvelous 
sun that in a minute turned red, 
speading itself out to vanish in the 
general glow. Then the earth was 
still at last. 

Duncan walked in a daze, until ho 
saw Colleen trying to round up 
the sheep. Then he waved to her, 
and trotted after her to help. The 
wolf was dead, and he had a won- 
derful sign to tell. The gods had not 
killed him. Beneath his running feet, 
the steadiness of the ground seemed 
permanent. END

Haywood person,” she 
A said, “has been teaching 
young people that they can go out- 
side Marstation without a sacred hel- 
met.” Eunice Mackdee, a sloppy, fat 
woman, was clearly a fanatic — 
she admitted belonging to the ul- 
traconservative Orthodox Scientists 
— yet her voice was surprisingly 
calm. 

“You have evidence of this, Mrs. 
Mackdee?” the chief scientist asked. 

“Enough, including the testimony 
of my own son.” 



Ponderously the chief scientist 
turned toward Bruce Haywood. “Do 
you wish at this time to make a 
statement in your own defense?” 
“Defense, sir?” Bruce Haywood 
laughed uneasily. “But it’s ridiculous. 
We’re all scientists at Marstation. 
We have the irrevocable right to 
the free expression of ideas — ” 
“Only in terms of the principles 
of science.” 

“The issue here, sir, is freedom 
to think!” 

“Will you give me a straight 
answer? Have you been teaching 
young people to go outside Marsta- 



60 



tion without their sacred helmets?” 

Haywood hesitated. In the con- 
flict between orthodoxy and the ab- 
stract ideal of truth, what was an 
honest answer? Taking advantage of 
his hesitation, Mrs. Mackdee volun- 
teered : 

‘T want it clearly understood that 
I have no personal feeling of venge- 
ance for this Haywood person. My 
•on is lost to Orthodox Science; I 
accept that. But as a mother I have 
a duty to save other innocent, young 
minds from his kind of teaching.” 

“Don’t be an absolute ass, Mrs. 
Mackdee!” Haywood exclaimed. 
“We’re all lost if we continue to 
tie ourselves to rituals we no longer 
understand.” 

“Orthodox Scientists,” she re- 
sponded in cold dignity, “have no 
doubt about the rituals.” 

“Some of us aren’t even sure 
why we’re here at Marstation,” Hay- 
wood countered. 

“To service interplanetary craft 

ft 

“Which have not landed at our 
port in six centuries!” Haywood re- 
minded her. 

Pursing her lips so that she ap- 
peared to be smiling benignly, Mrs. 
Mackdee turned toward the chief 
icientist. “Isn’t it an appropriate 
time to begin the formal hearing?” 

T he chief scientist sighed and 
slipped the sacred, ritual helmet 
over his head, indicating that he 
would hereafter be functioning in 
his official capacity as the religious 
and political leader of the com- 
munity. He glanced at the brief 
which Mrs. Mackdee had submitted. 



“Your first witness, I take it, it 
Ted Brand?” 

“Yes — one of Haywood’s boy- 
hood friends.” 

Ted Brand entered the hearing 
room and took the oath on the 
sacred books of science, swearing 
that he would give nothing but ob- 
jectively factual scientific evidence. 
He sat rigidly in the chair facing 
the chief scientist. Throughout his 
testimony, Brand stared directly at 
his inquisitor, never allowing his 
glance to stray in Bruce Haywood’s 
direction. 

Reading from a card which ho 
held nervously in his hand, Ted 
Brand said, “Bruce Haywood and 
I lived in the south sector, near 
the perimeter of Marstation, when 
we were kids. Sometimes after our 
regular, daily training periods in the 
ritual we would go to an abandoned 
playground which was built close to 
the base of the airseal dome over 
Marstation. It was here ...” 

Vividly Haywood remembered 
those carefree days of childhood, 
before he had started training as a 
teacher of the scientific ritual. He 
liked to go to that abandoned play- 
ground because there he had an un- 
obstructed view of the arid, red 
desert outside Marstation. To him 
it did not appear a barren waste, 
but rather hospitable and fertile be- 
cause of the green lichen growing on 
the red soil and along the banks of 
the dry river beds, as straight as if 
they had been carved like canals 
upon the face of the planet. 

Mrs. Mackdee asked Brand if 
Haywood had ever touched one of 
the broad, alumimim beams which 



WAY STATION 



61 




formed the airseal dome above Mar- 
station. While such an act was now 
illegal — one of several sacrileges 
recently prohibited by the code of 
law which the Orthodox Scientists 
had persuaded the government to 
authorize — it had not been a crime 
when Haywood was a boy. Had he 
touched the beam? Of course, sever- 
al times and in Brand’s presence, as 
Brand testified at the hearing. And 
once Haywood had done more. 

I t happened late in the afternoon. 

Haywood climbed to the top of 
a rusting jungle gym. The joint 
formed by a beam and a horizontal 
supporting girder was directly above 
him. He could reach it easily. 

He fingered the rivets while he 
examined the edges of the beams. 
The dome was like an enormous, 
latticed window, built in the shape 
of a huge hemisphere. Yet in the 
open spaces between the beams there 
was no visible material, like the 
pieces of window glass carefully pre- 
served in the museum of the tem- 
ple of science. 

What, then, sealed the air with- 
in Marstation, walling out the thin 
atmosphere of the planet? A cur- 
tain of atomic energy, said the Or- 
thodox Scientists. For all Haywood 
knew they could be right. The 
sacred books of science were crowd- 
ed with references to the power 
of the atom. Atomic energy was 
somehow created in the sealed re- 
actors which were the only source 
of power in Marstation. The scien- 
tists — and every citizen of tihe 
station was a scientist — took the 
power for granted, but no one knew 



what an atom was; nor was it per- 
missible to make scientific investir 
gation of the data in the texts. In 
the remote past St. Einstein had 
stolen the secret of the atom from 
the gods; that was all man needed 
to know about it. 

Bruce Haywood clung to the 
aluminum beam searching the metal 
for any sign of an outlet from which 
the protective curtain of invisible 
atoms might be projected. He had 
made the same test before; as al- 
ways, he found nothing. If there 
were no outlet, did it follow that 
the curtain of atoms did not exist? 

Haywood had always been taught 
that atomic power would, in an in- 
stant, destroy any material object it 
touched. He took from his pocket a 
tiny spool of magnetic tape on 
which he recorded his ritual assign- 
ments from the learning center, and 
he dropped the spool through the 
opening in the airseal dome. 

Nothing happened. The tape slid 
down the beam, bounced on the red 
earth outside, and rolled back un- 
der the dome. Ted Brand had seen 
it all; Haywood was certain of that. 
At Haywood’s hearing. Brand com- 
pleted his testimony by referring to 
that same incident. 

UTi was a clever trick, of course. 

Xl never understood how Bruce 
made it look as if that spool of tape' 
had actually passed through the 
dome unharmed. We all know that^ 
impossible; the tape would have been 
burned to a crisp. So I simply 
wouldn't ask Bruce how he did it; I 
didn’t want him to think I had been 
taken in by a trick.”

“Do you consider this recital of 
gossip evidence?” Haywood demand- 
ed of the chief scientist when Brand 
had been dismissed from the stand. 

“Mr. Haywood,” the chief retort- 
ed, “I must remind you that this is 
a formal hearing. You have the 
right to respond to a direct question 
if you choose; but you may not in- 
terrupt the proceedings to make 
comments upon the testimony.” He 
looked at the Mackdee brief again. 
“The next witness is Dr. Will 
Storm.” 

“He volunteered his testimony,” 
Eunice Mackdee said in pride. And 
he’s the type that would, Haywood 
thought; old Stormy was just the 
type. 

An aging, red-faced man entered 
the hearing room and, after having 
ceremoniously bowed to the panel of 
judges, seated himself in the wit- 
ness chair. Beaming at them all, he 
adjusted his jacket so that they 
could see his lapel pin, a replica of 
the sacred helmet worn by citizens 
who had been publicly honored by 
the Orthodox Scientists. 

“I am both awed and honored 
that my opinion should be sought 
by so august a body of scientists,” 
Dr. Storm began in the magnificent 
organ bellow which had made him 
so impressive a figure to many of 
his students. Not to Haywood, 
though, who thought the doctor was 
a bumbling farce, hypnotized by the 
sound of his own voice. He had 
the not unusual skill among teach- 
ers of churning out words by the 
hour, yet saying nothing; but his 
role of the learned philosopher was 
so perfectly stereotyped few of his 



students ever suspected his quack- 
ery. 

“It is my earnest hope tiiat I may 
adequately satisfy your inquiry into 
this tragic situation, while at the 
same time I do no injustice to my 
former student, Bruce Haywood,” 
Storm continued, still beaming, 
“though I must admit I am not at 
all surprised to find Haywood having 
problems. An experienced teacher 
— and as you know I’ve been teach- 
ing for twenty years — is an expert 
judge of human nature; and I must 
admit that from the first day when 
Bruce Haywood was assigned to my 
group, I had serious doubts about 
his qualifications . 

n 

T hat first day: Haywood remem- 
bered it clearly. Only three 
years had passed since he had en- 
rolled in the final learning group 
which he was required to pass be- 
fore entering the Temple of Sci- 
ence as a probationary teacher. Hay- 
wood was in his early twenties 
then, a quiet, introspective youth 
still trying to rationalize answers to 
the annoying questions that plagued 
his mind. 

The class met in a large lecture 
hall on the top floor of the Temple 
— five students and a teacher in a 
room designed to accommodate three 
hundred. After listening to the first 
few minutes of Storm’s opening 
lecture Haywood concluded that the 
professor had nothing to say. Steal- 
Aily he slid his chair toward the 
side of the hall, until he was able 
to peer through the glassless win- 



64 



IF 




dow at Ac chy beneath Ae dome 
and the red desert surrounding it. 

From the highest floor of Ac 
Temple the distant blue hills seem- 
ed closer and more inviting than 
ever. What lay behind them? What 
lay past the curve of the horizon? 
Haywood felt imprisoned within the 
city, held captive in a microscopic 
bubble fixed to the surface of the 
vast and beautiful world. 

Why had Marstation been built 
originally? Who had established the 
routines of science and for what 
reason? Was it all the pointless 
distortion of myth^ or was it 
simply a misunderstanding of fact? 
So much that was printed in the 
sacred scientific books v/as obvious- 
ly nonsense — the mathematics in- 
volving gravity, for example, since 
Ae measurable force at Marstation 
was considerably less than that as- 
sumed in the texts. But Haywood 
couldn’t quite bring himself to re- 
ject all of science because of its 
more obvious errors; such thinking 
resembled too closely the fanaticism 
of the Orthodox Scientists. But how 
was truA to be sifted from the 
sacred texts? 

Suddenly Haywood became aware 
of a dead silence. He focused his 
attention again* upon Dr. Storm, un- 
comfortably aware that the teacher 
was glaring at him coldly. 

‘‘And how would you present Ae 
problem, Mr. Haywood?” 

“Sorry, sir,” he apologized. “I 
didn’t hear the question.” 

“So we have a slow learner with 
us, I see.” Storm beamed and the 
other students knew this was their 
cue to laugh, which Aey did duti- 



fully. “You may find it necessary to 
do considerable extra work, Mr. 
Haywood, to keep up with the 
class.” 

“I shall do what I am assigned, 
sir.” 

“Indeed, I should hope so — if 
you mean to be graduated with your 
class. By tomorrow I expect you to 
commit to memory the first five 
pages in the sacred text of ’St. Dar- 
win. You will use the full text, 
which is in the Temple library, rath- 
er than the summary editions which 
you have been accustomed to read- 
ing in the past.” 

H aywood was delighted by the 
assignment of the extra work, 
for it was the first time in his life 
that he was granted access to the 
library in the Temple of Science. 
Freedom to use the original texts 
was to him the one worthwhile re- 
sult of Storm’s class. He not only 
memorized the designated pages, but 
read on in St. Darwin’s lx>ok until 
the library was closed for the night. 

Among the texts brought from 
earth by the founders, the mystic — 
and perhaps magic — volumes writ- 
ten by St. Einstein and St. Darwin 
were the best known and the least 
understood. The men were both said 
to have been outstanding chief sci- 
entists on earth, since their names 
were so often cited in the l:sser 
known sacred texts. Of the two, St 
Darwin was the least comprehensible 
to both teacher and student, for he 
wrote of a voyage he had taken by 
floating upon a vast body of water. 
Since it was clearly impossible for 
such a quantity of water to exist — 



WAY STATION 



65 




according to calculations made by 
the mathematicians in the Temple, 
the weight of it would crush the 
thin outer crust of any planet — 
St. Darwin’s expedition was clearly 
a symbolic presentation of scientific 
fact. 

The riddle buried in the symbo- 
lism intrigued Haywood, as it had 
hundreds of scholars before his 
time. Why would so great a chief 
scientist have chosen to express his 
ideas in imagery thait was not only 
absurd but also repugnant to the 
average reader? 

As the year passed, Haywood took 
every opportunity, even repeated 
additional assignments from Dr. 
Storm, to read in the Temple li- 
brary. Beyond St. Darwin he ex- 
panded his interests to other books 
which had been brought to Marsta- 
tion by the founders. The basic sa- 
cred texts of technology did not in- 
terest him, but Haywood was fasci- 
nated by the material which the li- 
brarians classified as mystical writ- 
ing. These texts were never given as 
assignments, and they were almost 
never read. 

In the course of time the students 
in Storm’s class were issued their 
sacred helmets in a solemn cere- 
mony conducted by the chief sci- 
entist. Following the blessing and the 
usual prayers, each man in Hay- 
wood’s group pulled his helmet over 
his head. In single file they marched 
after Dr. Storm toward the airlock 
exit from the station. 

We’re like knights, Haywood 
thought, recalling one of the books 
he had read in the library. It gave 
him a sense of identification witii 



the long history of earth, and the 
insight helped him understand hit 
own world better. 

The five students followed Storm 
to the launching pad and the ser- 
vice buildings which stood on the 
desert soil some distance outside the 
city. Without a hitch they went 
through the ritual of running the 
complex machinery of a space port 
Blindly each man performed a speci- 
fic skill. Perhaps he no longer under- 
stood the reason for his job or the 
machine he ran, but that hardly 
mattered. 

H aywood watched the agricultural 
technicians who were working 
the farmed acres which lay between 
the station and the launching pad. 
Narrow poles carried a spiral of 
feathery, metal filaments high 
above the furrows; these poles were 
familiar devices used for collecting 
water from the frost which settled 
on the red planet after dark. A split- 
second shock of heat through the 
metal pole transformed the frost into 
minute drops of water, which slid 
down the filaments, through the 
hollow pile, and into insulated tanks 
below. Regularly, twenty times each 
hour during the bitterly cold night, 
the precious water dripped into the 
tanks. 

Haywood realized abruptly that 
this source of water must have been 
invented to meet the conditions ex- 
isting on the red planet. None of 
the texts which he had read in the 
library — and by that time he had 
broused through hundreds — men- 
tioned that there was any need on 
earth for a special water collection. 



66 



IF 




This suggested that water on earth 
might exist in such abundance that 
earth people took it for granted. 

When his learning group had been 
taken outside the dome for two 
consecutive weeks to practice their 
rituals, Dr. Storm began to relax 
his close supervision. Haywood 
seized upon this opportunity to wan- 
der off from the others, far enough 
so that no one would necessarily 
see what he was up to. Thus alone, 
he made the vital test. He removed 
his helmet and kept it off for several 
minutes. As he had surmised, the 
globe about his head was more 
hinderance than help. He breathed 
more easily the clear, cold air of the 
red planet; it was invigorating, and 
far from harmful. 

He had the proof at last. But 
proof of what? If men could live 
as easily, without the dome and 
without the helmet, why had they 
been necessary to the founders? 
Haywood had the feeling that under- 
standing was on the fringe of his 
mind, just beyond his grasp. But he 
couldn’t clarify his thinking, except 
for a vague conviction that the 
answer was in the mystical writings 
of St. Darwin. 

m 

Xf was not, in the end, the gospe! 
JL of St. Darwin or even Hay- 
wood’s own experience with the hel- 
met that gave him his first real clue 
to the truth, but rather a forgotten 
pamphlet on child care. No text 
in the library coetalned ,a pic- 
ture of a man; the founders had, 
perhaps understandably, considered 



it pointless to give valuable space 
to the obvious. But in the dusty, 
aging, faded pamphlet Haywood 
found a brief description of a new- 
born child, **The small, helpless, 
pink-skinned infant, with its short, 
stubby arms and legs, its head so dis- 
proportionately large relative to the 
trunk of the body . .” 

A cold shock shuddered through 
Haywood’s mind. In almost those 
identical words his mother had 
once described her child who died of 
the bleeding sickness. Pink skin; 
large head; these always character- 
ized the deformed monstrosities 
which never survived birth at Mar- 
station. But this was the normid 
earth child, not a monstrosity! 
There was no bleeding sickness, then 
— merely the reaction of a normal 
infant to an unendurable environ- 
ment. 

We’re the deformed, Haywood 
thought, nauseated by disgust with 
himself. We’ve changed physically 
so that we can survive. '^He raced 
back to the gospel of St. Darwin, 
and poured over the pages, intuitive- 
ly fitting together the logical struo 
ture of an ancient earth science. 
Survival of the fittest; natural selec- 
tion; adaptation. 

Adaptation! Now he knew the 
truth and his nausea was gone. How 
foolish to be disgusted by the change 
an organism made within itself, putt- 
ing itself up by the bootstraps in 
order to survive! What a magnificent 
thing was man, to meet the chal- 
lenge of a new environment and to 
maintain a foothold of life on a 
strange, new world. 

In a vague way, without losing 



WAY STATION 



67 




his newly tounv leirniie uion with 
the past, Haywood he 'an to see 
himself as a man ol this new world. 
This was his home, no longer the 
earth from which his fathers had 
come. Haywood and his people were 
on the threshold of a new world, 
a new experience, a greatness still 
to be defined — if only they would 
break away from the traditions and 
the rituals that held them confined 
within the useless dome of Marsta- 
tion. 

It was then that Haywood realized 
how fortunate he was to be trained 
for teaching. He might, otherwise, 
have wasted a lifetime trying to 
persuade the chief scientist or the di- 
rectors of the Temple to understand 
the insights which seemed so clear 
to him. The rituals of the Orthodox 
Scientists had imposed too many 
controls upon the thinking of adults. 
But children, still forming their ideas, 
might understand; as a teacher, 
Haywood could reach their young 
minds and give them the fresh, new 
world which the Orthodox Scientists 
were blindly rejecting. 

F rom the witness chair at the 
hearing Dr. Storm gave an un- 
favorable opinion of Haywood as a 
student. “Brilliant, I suppose, but 
moody; not the sort of lad to join 
in the games and horseplay with the 
other kids. I always say, you can’t 
trust people who think too much,” 
he concluded. 

“What of his work?” the chief 
scientist inquired. 

“Unusually good,” Storm admit- 
ted — to Haywood’s surprise, since 
his grades had been poor. But Storm 



added, beaming again at the judges, 
“However, as I always say, excellent 
scholarship is not the best recom- 
mendation for a teacher. In the 
teaching profession we need out- 
going folks who can understand and 
adjust; most important, they must 
be good disciplinarians.” 

“You had disciplinary trouble 
with Haywood?” 

“I, sir, have never had trouble 
disciplining a pupil. However, as 
soon as Haywood’s .group began 
the actual practice of the ritual . .” 
Mrs. Mackdee gasped. There was 
a stir of muttered disbelief among 
the judges. The chief scientist asked, 
“At that time. Dr. Storm, did you 
report that Haywood had removed 
his helmet in violation of the ritual?” 
“No, sir; I always had some doubt 
about Haywood’s qualification as a 
teacher — and, of course, this hear- 
ing indicates how right 1 was — 
but —” 

“Dr. Storm, why didn’t you report 
Haywood directly to me?” 

“I was trying to be too objec- 
tive, T suppose, too scientific in my 
attitude. T disliked Haywood; I 
thought he was far too independent 
minded to make a good teacher. 
Consequently, I bent over backward 
to give him the benefit of every 
doubt.” 

“You still haven’t answered my 
question, sir.” 

“The truth is, I — I didn’t exactly 
see Haywood with the helmet off. 
I just had the impression that he 
had removed it.” 

“Then, in essence. Dr. Storm,” the 
chief scientist summarized, “your 
actual evidence against Haywood 



68 



IF 





amounts to nothing. You noted no 
real violation of the ritual and — ” 

“But I formed opinions, sir. As 
I told you, I’m an excellent judge 
of people." I’ve never been wrong 
before.” 

“Your comments. Dr. Storm, have 
no doubt been instructive, but un- 
fortunately lacking in objective 
data.” 

Mrs. ,Mackdee intervened. “Ask 
him! Ask this Haywood person if 
he had his helmet off outside of the 
station.” 

For some seconds the chief scien- 
tist studied Haywood’s face in silence 
and Haywood wondered how he 
would reply to the direct question. 
The penalty for perjury was no less 
severe than the penalty for convic- 
tion of heresy, and if he told the 
truth there was a remote diance 



that someone in the hearing room 
might understand him. The idea of 
ultimate freedom for the people con- 
fined beneath the dome would then 
not be lost, whatever sentence was 
imposed upon Haywood. 

H owever, he was not given the 
opportunity to reply to the 
question, for the chief scientist 
turned toward Mrs. Mackdee and 
asked : 

“Do you believe he took his hel- 
met off outside?” 

“Of course not; ,he would have 
died at once.” 

“Then it’s a foolish question to 
ask, don’t you think?” 

“But he’s trying to persuade young 
people to do precisely that!” 

“We must establish more positive 
proof, Mrs. Mackdee.” The chief 



WAY STATION 



69 




scientist glanced impatiently at his 
watch. “I hope we can conclude 
this hearing before the graduation 
ceremonies this afternoon — for your 
owr son’s group, by the way, Mrs. 
Mackdee. In order to save time, 
I suggest that we hear your son’s 
testimony now.” 

“I object,” Eunice Mackdee re- 
plied. “I intend to prove that other 
students have been taught these same 
insidious lies as well as my Ray.” 

“Your son’s evidence will be quite 
sufficient.” 

“I want H understood that I have 
no personal feeling of vindictive- 
ness toward this Haywood person.” 

“As you have told us, Mrs. Mack- 
dee.” 

“I am simply doing my duty as 
a citizen and as an Orthodox Scien- 
tist.” 

“Of course — and as a concerned 
mother.” 

“I have nothing but objective love 
for this unfortunate and misguided 
teacher. I would be overjoyed if, as 
a result of this hearing, we might 
make him comprehend the deep 
error of — ” 

“Then, naturally, you have no ob- 
jection if we hear your son’s testi- 
mony now.” The chief scientist made 
an impatient gesture, and the guard 
escorted Ray Mackdee into the hear- 
ing room. 

The boy was small for his age, 
nervous and frightened. Like Ted 
Brand, he refused to look in Hay- 
wood’s direction. Haywood was sure 
Ray would betray him, perhaps 
because he was frightened by the 
grim determination of his mother; 
or perhaps because, when he had to 



make a final choice, he was afraid tm 
consider any truth which opposed 
the teaching of Orthodox Science. 

It was a pity, Haywood thought, 
for Ray Mackdee was the smartest 
student — potentially the best fu- 
ture leader — whom Haywood had 
taught during his three years as a 
probationary teacher. 

L earning groups in the Temple of 
Science were divided into three 
types: superior groups, designated 
as the Talented, which trained stu- 
dents in the most complex rituals 
of science; average groups, learn- 
ing the technical skills; and the 
Basics, where students were capable 
of learning only the simplest, ser- 
vice rituals such as community main- 
tenance, argriculture and teaching. 

To assign the most inadequate 
teachers to the Talented students and 
the most capable to the Basics was 
one of the oldest traditions in Mar- 
station brought by the first colonists 
from earth. This was the Doctrine of 
St. Conant, said to be the only truly 
democratic form of education. “The 
Talented can learn despite the teach- 
er,” or so Orthodox Scientists de- 
clared, quoting a popular aphorism 
attributed to St. Conant, “but Basic 
groups require the skills of the most 
capable and the most experienced 
teachers.” 

Largely because of Dr. Storm’s 
lukewarm recommendation, Bruc: 
Haywood had been assigned to teach 
the Talented. During the three yen i s 
of his probationary teaching he In 1 
subtly directed them to areas of re- 
search calculated to plant in Ihcir 
minds considerable doubt of the in- 




fallibility of Orthodox Science. Hay- 
wood was sure that, if Mrs. Mack- 
dee were permitted to call other 
students to add their testimony to 
her son’s, she could more than 
prove her charges, even though, in 
an exact, legal sense, she would be 
wrong; for Haywood had done noth- 
ing in the classroom that was not 
properly related to the course of 
study. 

In the beginning Ray Mackdec 
made a poor, perhaps a foolish wit- 
ness. He stammered and he seemed 
imsure of himself. Repeatedly his 
mother interrupted him to put words 
ki his mouth. In a dead monotone, 
without emotion, he obediently re- 
cited what she told him to say. 

“Did Mr. Haywood ever advise 
you to go outside Marstation with- 
out your sacred helmet?” the chief 
scientist asked Ray. 

“Not in so many words, but — ” 
“Of course he did!” Eunice Mack- 
dee snapped. 

Mackdee, let your 
y son tell it in his own way.” 

“I am only doing my duty!” 
“You have already made that 
qoke clear, Mrs. Mackdee. Now, 
•on, explain what your teacher did 
tell you about the outside.” 

“First, he assigned us to read old 
books in the library.” 

Mrs. Mackdee interjected, “Not 
the sacred texts of Orthodox J^ience; 
remember that.” 

“Our teachers and students have 
always been free to use any avail- 
able reading material in their re- 
search,” the chief scieotist reminded 
her. 



“Something shall have to be done 
about that,” she declared. “To put 
such questionable material into the 
hands of young people — ” 

“But there is no restrictive regula- 
tion at the present time,” he remind- 
ed her. “We can hardly ask our 
judges to convict Mr. Haywood oi 
breaking a rule which doesn’t yet 
exist.” 

“All this legal quibbling — ^ifs 
simply an evasion of the truth. This 
Haywood person has systematicaUy 
betrayed our children and you can- 
not argue that fact away.” 

“That is not my intention. I mere- 
ly hope to get at some sort of ob- 
jective fact we can use. Please con- 
tinue, son. After you completed your 
reading, what happened?” 

“In my learning group we dis- 
cussed the research.” 

“Was Mr. Haywood present?” 
“Yes, but he never said much. He 
just let us talk.” 

Mrs. Mackdec broke in again. 
“And, as I got the story from Ray, 
these kids brought up all sorts ^ 
issues — questioning the most funda- 
mental truths of Orthodox Science. 
I have kept as evidence one of Ray’s 
papers In which he tried to prove 
there is no curtain of atomic energy 
radiating from the beams in the 
dome above Marstation. The teacher 
not only accepted that balderdash, 
but he gave Ray a good grade for it.” 
“We encourage freedom of ex- 
pression, Mrs. Mackdee.” 

“Only when it is based upon the 
facts of Orthodox Science.” 

“We still have no evidence — ” 
“Let Ray teH you the rest of it I” 
■he interrupted.

44TV >Tr. Haywood used to' talk 
iVAover our papers with us af- 
ter he graded them. He kept telling 
us never to believe in something 
nmply because we wanted it to be 
true. He said eve^ scientific truth 
had to be tested constantly by re- 
peated experiment.” 

“There’s nothing wrong with 
that, son.” 

“Several times he used the dome 
over Marstation as an example. He 
said, if we could prove there was no 
curtain of energy between the beams, 
then — then the air outside the sta- 
tion would be no different from that 
inside. And if diat were true, we 
could live anywhere on the planet, 
free of the dome and without sa- 
cred helmets.” 

“Do you understand now,” Mrs. 
Mackdee demanded, “what this 
Haywood person has been teach- 
ing?” 

The chief scientist turned sad- 
ly toward Haywood. “Is this true?” 
he asked. 

“In the classroom, I taught only 
the material approved by the direc- 
tors of the Temple of Science,” 
Haywood replied. 

“Then you deny — ” 

“Oh, that’s quite correct,” Ray 
Mackdee volimteered. “Mr. Hay- 
wood never talked about die dome 
or the outside unless we went to 
visit him after class.” 

“At his home, Ray?” 

“Yes.” 

“Did Mr. Haywood invite you for 
these discussions?” 

“No. He’s just a real, nice guy,

n 

US. 



“So these discussions took place 
away from the learning center and 
not as part of any required assign- 
ment. Is this how it happened, Mr. 
Haywood?” 

“As a teacher,” Haywood said* 
“I’m responsible to you and to die 
directors of the Temple for oidy 
what I do as part of my formal 
classroom work.” 

“There!” Mrs. Mackdee pointed 
out triumphantly. “He’s as much ae 
admitting the whole thing.” 

4 4XTonetheless, Mrs. Mackdee, 
what Mr. Haywood does ou^ 
side the temple is his own business.” 
“Do you mean to tell me he is 
privileged to teach children to doubt 
the Orthodox rituals?” - 
“He hasn’t broken any law.” 
“You’re splitting hairs! I intend 
to see to it — ” 

“This is an area where we’ll need 
tighter regulations in the future, I 
suppose. The hearing, Mrs. Mack- 
dee, has shown us several weakness- 
es in the structure of Temple au- 
thority. The directors will, I f^ sure, 
make some revisions in the basic 
law as a result of our findings.” 

“I want this Haywood person pun- 
ished!” 

“I realize he has been too friend- 
ly with his students and thereby too 
effective, perhaps, as a teacher — ^too 
much of an inspiration to young 
people; even so, what can we do?” 
“Remove him from the classroom, 
at least.” 

“Naturally. He’ll have to submit 
to retraining for another ritual.” 
“And prohibit him further use of 
the temple library.”

“Absolutely. Mr. Haywood has 
misused the tools of research to ar- 
rive at conclusions incompatible with 
the convictions of Orthodox 
Science.” 

Bruce Haywood sat paralyzed by 
frustration and anger while they 
settled his future. This defeat seemed 
so futile; so sit in silence while this 
fanatic woman destroyed him — ^be- 
cause he had practiced an ideal of 
science which the Orthodox Scien- 
tists recited as the keystone of their 
doctrine. Test truth by experiment — 
how the scientists could reel off 
those words to ornament any occa- 
sion! Words. Words empty of mean- 
ing, the incantations of savages. 

Haywood’s punishment left him 
numb. Retraining for another ritual? 
What else could he do? What else 
did he want to learn? He was a 
teacher because his fathers before 
him had been teachers. He had never 
for a moment considered any other 
career. And now Eunice Mackdee, 
this fat, vindictive woman, had taken 
it from him. A sentence of death 
would have been kinder. 

“Too friendly, too effective as a 
teacher,” the chief scientist had said, 
denying the very skills most ardent- 
ly sought among those selected for 
training 'in the teaching ritual. Rout- 
ed by the aggressive determination 
of one fanatic, the chief scientist laid 
bare the spineless, vascilating nature 
of the Temple administration. 

IV 

H aywood’s hearing ended ten min- 
utes before the graduation ex- 
ercises were held in the public arena 



which adjoined the airlock exit 
from the dome. Though his teach- 
ing career was over, Bruce Haywood 
attended the service, as he had for 
every graduation since his boyhood. 
The solemn dedication to youth to 
service, truth and justice had al- 
ways symbolized a great deal to him. 
It was hard for Haywood to make 
himself believe that this was his 
last graduation; he would never be 
admitted to the Temple again. He 
had fought, no doubt very badly, 
against ignorance, and ignorance had 
won handily, without much of a 
struggle. 

Before the chief scientist intro- 
duced the graduates, among them 
Ray Mackdee, he gave his usual ora- 
tion, a sentimental blend of pretty 
phrases about democracy, man’s 
right to the free expression of ideas, 
and the dedication of science to 
truth. The blatant hypocrisy made 
Haywood almost physically sick, 
but then he realized that the hy- 
pocrisy had always been there, in 
every graduation address. He recog- 
nized it, now, only because of hi* 
bitterness over the result of his hear- 
ing. 

Who, then, was at fault? Not the 
chief scientist, for he had always 
been a consistent, plodding unin- 
spired compromiser. Not Mrs. 
Mackdee, the honest fanatic of Orth- 
odox Science. 

Tm responsible — the thought 
took Haywood by surprise. We’re 
all to blame. We have made of Mar- 
station exactly the restricted prison 
we’re willing to live in. Maybe this 
isn’t what each of us wants, but 
we’re willing to endure it because

wc haven’t the courage to fight for 
something better. 

1 <f Haywood had the courage of his 
convictions, it was time he took 
some definite action that would 
demonstrate his convictions as ef- 
fectively as Mrs. Mackdee dram- 
atized hers. But what could he do? 
Leap to the speaker’s platform, per- 
haps, seize the microphone from the 
chief scientist, and explain away the 
imaginary curtain of atoms. 

Not words; words were the 
weapons of the fanatics. Test truth 
by experiment! He could demon- 
strate, obviously and clearly, that 
the dome was open to the atmo- 
sphere of the red planet. 

Haywood left his seat and walked 
toward the platform, which was built 
close to the base of the dome. The 
aluminum girders curved upward 
only inches above the speaker’s head. 
In full view of that audience, Hay- 
wood intended to climb a beam and 
swing himself in and out of the dome. 

He reached the platform. The 
chief scientist shot an angry, annoyed 
glance at Haywood, but went on 
with his oration. 

Haywood raised his hands toward 
a beam. He pulled himself through 
the opening and sat on the outer 
surface of the beam, dangling his 
feet into the station. He had ex- 
pected a reaction, perhaps screams 
of panic from the audience, but 
there was nothing. He lowered him- 
self to the platform and grabbed a 
chair, hauling it through the dome 
with him. He banged it on the beam 
to attract attention, but still there 
was no response from the audience. 



Exasperated, he leaped to the plat- 
form, seized the microphone from 
the chief scientist, and screamed 
into it. 

‘'Don’t you see what I’m doing? 
There is no atomic curtain! These 
is no dome! You’re free to go 
where — ” 

There was brief, angry pandemo- 
nium in the audience. Guards seized 
Haywood and dragged him away. 
“Confinement, sir?” 

“No, final disposal, I think,” tiis 
chief scientist said. 

I nstead of being frightened by the 
sentence of death, Haywood was 
relieved. It was more considerate 
than the decision at the hearing to 
remove him forever from teaching. 
With nothing further to lose, ha 
broke away from the guards and 
tried to reach the microphone again. 
He had a fleeting impression of the 
chief scientist’s face close to his, 
twisted in an agony of compassion. 
Then Haywood felt the stab of a 
needle. Sharp pain, dizzy nausea; 
nothing. 

Disposal. 

So this was death. 

But slowly the black mist lifted. 
Slowly he became aware of sensar 
tion. First the customary chill ci 
night cold! then the hard ground be- 
neath his back. He opened his eye*. 

He stood up slowly, trembling for 
a moment in the blast of sub-zero 
wind. Thep the loose folds of hk 
skin hardened into the familiar, 
thick ridges — his people, for some 
reason, called these goosebumps — 
which automatically sealed in his 
body warmth and made him quite

the red planet. 

On the horizon he saw the dome 
of Marstation and nearby the use- 
less towers of the space port, sharp- 
ly silhouetted against the light re- 
flected mto the night sky. Near 
where he had been lain on the earth 
to die — the usual sentence of dis- 
posal passed by the judges of Mar- 
station — Haywood found a knapsack 
of dried food and a canteen of 
water. An unsigned note was tucked 
beneath the knapsack. 

“People believe what they will,” 
he read. “Sometimes a belief hap-

Whaf wot Ihe message fhe deserted 
cities held? And — did H matter? 




T he rockets were already running 
when Scout Ship 1014 appear- 
ed suddenly off the planet Toran, 
and instantly they flashed far out 
to send the ship into what would 
be a screaming dive almost straight 
down. Behind, dwindling swiftly, a 
doud of exterior fittings that had 
been wrenched loose by the acceler- 
ation glowed when the exhaust 
brushed them. The ship shifted 
•lightly to head for what the pilot 
thought to be a continent, but as 
he had no knowledge of the planet’s 
flora it could as well have been an 
ocean. 

Inside the ship the pilot mutter- 
ed, crouched over his control panel. 



He was a thin, grainy-complexioned 
redhaired man named Skinner — 
and he was scared. He had had 
years of training in one of the 
galaxy’s best space schools, but now 
he relied far more on his years as 
an aircraft pilot than on anything he 
had learned in class. When the ship 
hit high altitude bumps he corrected 
automatically, slewing the little ship 
aroimd so that the rockets carved 
great arcs across the sky. 

A ^ort, dark crew member nam- 
ed Bannan hurtled into the control 
room, his thick body easily hand- 
ling the heavy acceleration but his 
balance at a loss with the ship’s 
Imrdies. A quick swerve sent him 



74 



careening into a bulkhead where by 
bracing his feet he managed to stay. 
He opened a thick manual he was 
carrying. 

“Skinner, listen. I tell you you’ll 
get us all in a terrible fix. Listen 
to this: ‘Among the most stringent 
of Space Service regulations are 
those governing landing procedure. 
In general, the shift from hyper- 
space to normal space and the ap- 
proach to a planet are made only 
after the most thorough considera- 
tion of an possibilities. Damage to 
the ship or hyperspace apparatus 
will be punished . .’” 

“Don’t worry about the hyper- 
space apparatus,” Skinner broke in. 
*We lost that long ago.” 

“Then you’ve stranded us here!” 
shouted Bannan. “If you don’t pile 
us ten miles into the planet with 
your crazy landing we’ll never get 
off it, and if we do we’ll be in the 
brig for breaking all the rules!” 

“To hell with the rules,” snarled 
Skinner. “I was once in a ship \^ith 
a leaky reactor and the pilot did 
just what I’m doing. We got out just 
in time. When this crate gives up 
the ghost it’ll take everything with 
it for miles around. No .Space Force 
detective will have any way of find- 
ing ouf what we’re doing now, or 
whether anyone broke any rules. 
Now do something useful. Look up 
Toran in that manual. I think it’s 
inhabited. Is it?” 

“Yes,” said Bannan after a pause. 
“Are they friendly?” 

“Yes. Intelligent and friendly.” 
“Good what color are the land 
masses?” 

“Green.” 



“Good. That’s where we’re going,” 
said Skinner. 

The third member of the crew, 
a slender Japanese named Doi, strug- 
gled into the room, dragging a mass 
of wires, detached instruments, and 
other miscellaneous equipment. He 
compensated easily for swerves, but 
the acceleration seemed to tell on 
him. 

“I couldn’t find anything wrong,” 
he said. “But something’s way out 
of whack. The random count m 
the lower reactor has picked way 
up. I’m going to get a scientilktor 
and see . .” 

“No, don’t,” Skinner said. “When 
we really start bouncing you might 
get electrocuted. Look, Bannan, you 
and Doi just run around and grab 
up things to take with us when we 
land. Open the airlock most of the 
way, and cut loose its safety locks 
and chain.” 

The ship bumped violently and 
the lights went out. Skinner stayed 
in his seat, working by touch and 
a faint flow from his viewscreen. 
The other two collected whatever 
equipment they could think of. They 
knew the little ship so well they 
were almost as unhampered by the 
dark as the pilot, though Bannan 
had lost his book. 

As the ship entered the heavier 
atmosphere it turned over and the 
rockets flared for all their brilliant 
length downward. With an ear-split- 
ting screech they descended precipi- 
tously toward a land feature that 
struck Skinner as significant for al- 
most any kind of creature — a great 
river delta that opened from a stubby 
isthmus between two continents.

W 




T he city was a strange one, half- 
way between sea and land, with 
curious convolutions of stone for 
buildings and water running down 
many of the streets. The three men 
used their antigravity raft to give it 
a long look, from several hundred 
feet up and an equal distance from 
the city’s edge. They regarded it 
somberly; it was their only means 
of getting passage from Toran and, 
unless they found food, their only 
means of staying alive. Only a min- 
ute after they had left the ship, half 
sunken with water bubbling around 
it from the intense skin heat, it had 
blown up and dug a great crater, 
throwing rocks and mud for miles. 

They had come thirty or forty 
miles from the landing site, across 
the flat sand of the river delta on 
which the city was located. They had 
been quiet during that trip, llieir 
nerves calmed from the frantic scam- 
pering of their close escape, and the 
immense, empty vistas of sky and 
sand helped prepare them to realize 
the drama of their approach to the 
city. Indeed, as they floated high 
above the walls of the alien city 
Doi glanced uncertainly at bis two 
colleagues, and observing their set 
expressions essayed something pro- 
found and significant himself. He 
was new at this business and not so 
sure as the older men of the appro- 
priate feelings for different situa- 
tions. 

Skinner spoke, his voice sound- 
ing with sturdy practicality instead 
of the high note audible during the 
last few minutes on the ship. “You 
figure to ground it here?” He indi- 
cated the sand flats below them. 



“No,” said Bannan, pondering. 
“We want to take no chances. I 
think we’d better fly over the city 
first, and see if we can scare up 
anyone or anything before we get 
off the raft.” 

“The city isn’t far from where 
the ship landed,” remarked Doi. “If 
we hit so near it just by accident, 
there must be lots of cities on this 
coast.” 

“I saw the city on the viewscreen 
and aimed for it,” said Skinner. “It’s 
the only one I saw, so it’s probably 
the only one for at least a few 
hundred miles.” 

A t these words there was a sharp 
hiss and the raft sank slowly. 
Bannan, who was driving h, fiddled 
and cursed at thr mntrols. Skinner 
asked, “What’s 

“No jets. s>:>tem is sealed, 
too — it could lake hours just to 
see what’s wrong. Doi, when we 
land you better get out and push.” 
Doi gave him a strange look. 
“Push?” 

“Right. The bouyancy controls 
will be hard to handle,” said Skin- 
ner. 

“I know.” They would be, for 
there was only one bouyancy con- 
trol, a single knob that could change 
the bouyancy of the raft by thou- 
sands of pounds. Usually t^ con- 
trol was only roughly set, and any 
necessary corrections were affected 
with the raft’s jets. 

Bannan would have one advan- 
tage when he delicately tried to set 
the knob for the proper bouyancy: 
when no hand touched the controls 
the raft would set itself to sink 



n 



IF 




automatically at the rate of a foot 
per second. If he could observe the 
setting the control knob took when 
it performed this automatic func- 
tion and then displace it by a milli- 
meter or so he could achieve a mild 
bouyancy. He tried several times 
and didn’t succeed. 

“Catch it, you fool!” Bannan 
shouted to Doi when he poked at 
the knob and the raft leaped up for 
the fourth time. Doi threw himself 
forward, caught the raft, and swung 
on it to bring it down. 

“Run along and get us going, 
then swing up,” ordered Bannan. 
Doi pushed at the raft until he was 
sprinting along beneath, then heav- 
ed himself up. The raft sank and 
bis feet dragged and bounced on 
the ground. Bannan gave a tiny poke 
to the knob to compensate and the 
raft soared again, so quickly that 
it wrenched free of Doi’s grip. He 
fell and would have rolled except 
that he struck a patch of thin mud. 

The mud on his face made Doi’s 
expression unreadable when he 
trudged up to the raft, but never- 
theless Bannan grunted in an abash- 
ed fashion. “Hmmph. Missed it 
that time. Let’s try it again, Doi.” 

“WTiy don’t you take the raft up, 
let it descend to him so that he can 
push it when it gets in range, and 
then he can hop on before it hits 
the ground and you can take the 
raft up,” said Skinner. 

“Yes. yes,” Bannan growled. “Of 
course.” 

W ith an abrupt twitch and a 
quick releasing of the knob he 
took the raft twelve feet up. Doi 



waited until it came into reach and 
then pushed. It accelerated slowly; 
Doi was tired, was trying to run 
in wet sand, and was pushing a 
heavy load. 

“Hurry up,” Skinner said. Doi 
muttered something unintelligible. 
The raft sank lower. 

“Get on, quick.” Doi leaped and 
landed on the raft, now only a foot 
or so off the ground. He slightly 
unbalanced it before its automatic 
system could compensate for his 
extra weight, and the tilting caused 
Bannan to miss his dab at the con- 
trol knob. Before he could try again 
the raft scrunched heavily into the 
sand and he went flying off the 
front end. Doi crashed into Skinner. 

By now the three men were begin- 
ning to look somewhat alike. Skin- 
ner’s contact with Doi had given 
him large soiled patches on his uni- 
form, much to annoyance, while 
Bannan was drenched and furious. 
Doi’s expression was still unread- 
able. 

“All right,” said Bannan. “We’re 
finally going to do this the right 
way.” 

“We’re almost in the city,” ob- 
jected Skinner, pelting at the silent 
walls fifty feet away. 

“It would stBl be best to fly over 
the city first. I’m pretty sure it says 
so in the Manual. Skinner, you drive 
the raft. I’ll push while the raft 
descends. However, this time when 
it gets too low I’ll move back and 
let you take it up. We’ll do it as 
many times as necessary to get the 
raft moving fast and get me on 
with plenty of time to spare. I’ll 
push the raft so that we go down

that long straight street there.” tie 
pointed at a street that began on 
the edge of the city and apparently 
continued far into it. 

Skinner stared at him for a mo- 
ment, skeptical but willing to let 
Bannan exert himself. He said, ‘'All 
right, you try.” 

Bannan pushed until he was trot- 
ting, then slowed to let Skinner jerk 
the raft up, trotting beneath it as it 
descended. When it came within 
reach he resumed his pushing. 

By this time they had entered 
and were travelling down the street 
Bannan had aimed for. Stone walls 
of alien buildings echoed the sound 
of his footsteps. Suddenly the sharp 
smacking of his boots changed to 
splashing as a ramp dipped away 
to a water filled street. 

With a hoarse shout he pulled at 
the raft, slowing it, but as the water 
became deeper he was dragged for- 
ward until he was plowing along 
with water sluicing over his excited 
face. Doi leaped to help him. Just 
before the raft touched the water, 
however, Skinner dabbed at the con- 
trol knob, causing the raft to leap 
upwards and throwing both Doi and 
Bannan into the water. When they 
emerged, treading to keep their 
heads above, Bannan shouted: “You 
crazy damned fool! What did you 
do that for?” 

Skinner was moving quickly about 
the raft. He picked up two plastic 
packages and threw them towards 
the two men. Then he replied, *T 
just remembered that the raft will 
sink through water. It sinks until 
the plungers on the bottom arc de- 
pressed.” Skinner was drifting away 



quickly; his voice was growing faint- 
er. 

“What do we do now?” 

“Reconnoitre.” 

“What!!?” 

“ni use the velocity I have now 
to traverse the city. You investigate 
these buildings. I’ll figure out some 
way to manage the raft and co ne 
back.” He was a long way away 
now, his voice fading to inaudibil- 
ity. 

They watched silently. Somehow 
the sense of drama had gone, dis- 
appeared as quietly as Skinner was 
now disappearing. When he ap- 
proached the water again he jerked 
the raft up and over a small build- 
ing at the end of the street. He 
lowered something, apparently ti*y- 
ing to grapple the buildings, and 
then sank out of sight on the other 
side. 

T he smooth building walls afford- 
ed no immediate way out of 
the water. Silently the two men 
gathered the packs and splashed 
back along the street until they could 
stand with their heads and chests out 
of the water. Doi noticed a feature 
he had seen before but not under- 
stood; along the walls of the build- 
ings were straight shafts of metal 
that projected about four feet out 
and parallel to the ground. 

“What do you make of those?” 
he asked. Bannan stopped and look- 
ed at them closely. 

“Beats me. They look like roosts 
for some kind of huge birds, near as 
I can tell.” 

“Do you think the planet is in- 
habited by birds?”

“Maybe it used to be. We haven t 
•een anything living, remember. 
They may have all died or moved 
away.” 

“How come there’s water in the 
ftreets?” 

Bannan was getting irritated. 
“Maybe the town flooded, maybe 
that’s why they moved away. How 
should I know?” 

“A town like this would flood 
pretty easily, being on a delta, 
wouldn’t it? Why would birds build 
a town on a river delta?” 

“Maybe they’re fishers, dammit f” 
Bannan’s face turned red. 

“Here, where the street gives way 
to the water, it slopes down evenly 
and quickly,” said Doi with a trace 
of malice in his voice. “It looks like 
a ramp to me, as if the water were 
intended to be there.” 

“Well damn, you’re full of spunk 
today! All right, maybe they built 
their town so it would have water 
in it. Maybe they wanted fish to 
come right up into it from the 
ocean. The birds could perch up 
there, and when they saw something 
. .” He broke off. The city seemed 
suddenly very quiet. They glanced 
around quickly but saw nothing ex- 
cept the strange buildings and enig- 
matic metal shafts. Bannan spoke: 
“Well, anyway, it seems to me the 
thing to do is to climb up on those 
perches and see if we can get to the 
top of a building. If these buildings 
really are monster aviaries thfere will 
be some way to get into them from 
the top.” He went to the side of a 
building, under a metal shaft that 
was four feet above his head. 
“Come on, give me a hand up.” 



D oi joined him and leaned with 
his hands against the building. 
Bannan clumsily climbed onto his 
back, then put his knees on the 
slender Asian’s shoulders. By stretch- 
ing upward he could just reach the 
bar. “Hah,” he said. “I can get it.” 
His wet hands clamped firmly 
onto the metal. There was a blue 
flash, and his tone became more 
heated. 

“Yahhh-hoooo!” Doi, through 
whom the current passed on its way 
to the water, lunged to one side, 
leaving Bannan swinging and curs- 
ing freely. His foot splashed into 
the water and caused a fresh screech. 
He pulled it up. 

“Don’t touch the water,” said 
Doi. “There’s a potential difference 
between it and Ae bar. Why didn’t 
you let go?” 

“My hands cramped and I 
couldn’t get them loose. They’re 
relaxing now.” He dropped into 
the water. “They say that’s bad for 
the heart, electric current.” 

Doi began unpacking a line kit 
from his survival pack. 

The main bulk of the line kit was 
in the two winches attached to 
either end of the line. The line it- 
self was an invisibly thin mono- 
molecular strand that would sup- 
port a horrendous weight and also 
would cut through the hand of 
anyone who tried to forcibly hold 
onto it. The winch had a spool, a 
fixed handle, and an outsize crank 
handle that could be geared to reel 
quickly, slowly or could be locked. 

Under the affronted gaze of Ban- 
nan, who stood gingerly flexing his 
hands, Doi locked one winch and

used it as a weight to throw the 
line over the perch nearest the top 
of the building. He retrieved the 
thrown winch and passed it around 
the original line to form a knot, 
which, with a jerk, quickly travelled 
up the gossamer thin line and 
clamped around the perch. Then, 
with one hand on the fixed han- 
dle of the first winch and crank- 
ing slowly with the other, he walk- 
ed up the side of the building. Ban- 
nan took the other winch and in a 
minute both men were standing sur- 
veying the roof. 

T 'he roof was covered with in- 
struments. There were things 
that looked like thermometers, wind 
vanes, pressure devices, cameras, 
radar, and other devices that were 
completely inexplicable. The most 
puzzling were several large, smooth- 
ly curved metal affairs, shaped 
something like miniature ampithea- 
tres or curved divans, that hummed 
quietly. Doi touched one lightly 
with two fingers and a reminiscent 
tingle passed through the finger- 
tips. 

“There’s a potential gradient on 
this surface. Heaven knows what 
the thing does.” 

They cast for a way to enter the 
building and eventually found one 
— an opening and a series of metal 
bars that led down into a dank dark- 
ness. Bannan shied back. “No sir, 
they’re not going to catch me with 
any of their electrified traps.” 

“It’s a pretty poor trap,” Doi said. 
He swung out on the first bar, then 
lowered himself until he was stand- 
ing on the next with bis rubber- 

S2 



shod feet. He continued in this way 
until he was out of sight. His voice 
echoed up. “Come on.” Bannan at- 
tempted the same procedure but 
missed the second bar and awk- 
wardly grabbed the pole from which 
the bars jutted, so that he banged 
against three of them at the same 
time. After a couple of nasty sec- 
onds he realized that nothing would 
happen to him. 

“My, Bannan, you’re clumsy. Why 
aren’t you dead?” 

“There’s no current in these bars,” 
Bannan said seriously as he climb- 
ed the rest of the way down and 
joined Doi, who had broken out 
a small light. They looked around. 
There was an array of equipment 
like that on the roof, but it was 
more massive and was not data- 
coHecting equipment. One square de- 
vice with many wheels and threads 
of fine wire could have been a rec- 
order of the data taken above. 
Cables led from squat machines to 
the ceiling and probably through it 
to the instruments above. 

There was nothing that gave them 
any useful information, and they 
moved down. The floor below was 
identical except for details, but the 
ground floor yielded much of inter- 
est. One corner of the room was 
filled with desklike objects, littered 
with rolls of wire and other odd 
junk. On one of the desks was a 
record player and record. 

“Fishy business,” muttered Ban- 
nan as he poked at the set. 

“You know, it does smell fishy, 
Hke a seafood stand, in here. T was 
trying to place it. ^^^hat s the rec— 
oidr 

IF 




Bannan picked it up. “One side 
has Violation Baby and Booby Ba- 
by by Slack-Lipped Harry’s Grim 
Rve, and the other has Dead Baby 
by the Cretins.” 

“Look at how the record player 
b arranged,” said Doi. “The out- 
put can be switched from that 
speaker to this wire recorder and 
also to these exposed leads. I won- 
der what they do with it?” 

“It must be sort of joke to them.” 
“Sort of a joke to anyone.” 

I n another corner of the room 
was a machine from which pro- 
jected a bar exactly like those on 
the wall outside. Checking with a 
thin wire established that it car- 
ried no charge. A hole in one side 
suggested a vending machine. 

“Let’s try to find some money,” 
said Doi. “I want to see what this 
machine does.” A short search of 
the desks yielded a cache of metal 
balls that could have been ball 
bearings, but were covered with 
complicated incisions. They tried a 
ball in the machine and it hummed. 
A thin wire draped across the bar 
so that it dangled to the floor 
quickly melted. 

“W^at a screwy blasted setup,” 
said Barman. ' 

“No, it isn’t screwy. I think 1 
just about have it figured out,” 

He looked mildly on as Bannan 
quickly became red in the face. Just 
before the inevitable explosion, he 
said, “But if I’m right we’d bet- 
ter get out of here. It was begin- 
ning to get dark when we entered 
the building. It ought to be fvfl 
night soon.” 



Bannan looked at him wordless- 
ly, then turned to climb the series 
of rungs. Doi said, “No. This way.” 
He led the way through a low 
door that opened into a small room 
where the floor was under water. 
He seemed satisfied. 

“See? Water.” 

“Praise be. Are you going to take 
a bath?” 

“I think this wall is the other 
side of the street wall we climbed 
up.” He jumped into the water, 
felt along the wall. “Ah. Here;” 
He ducked under water and disap- 
peared completely. In another cou- 
ple of seconds he was back. “There’s 
an opening. It leads put into the 
street. Come on.” 

Soon the two men emerged into 
the street and trudged back to high 
ground. Darkness was falling fast. 

“Now there remain only two 
things,” Doi said. “Skinner, with 
Ae translating machine, and the 
aliens.” 

“You’re pretty damn smugl” ex- 
ploded Bannan, but he couldn’t hide 
from his voice a trace of appre- 
hension that Doi had the answer. 
“What are Ae aliens?” 

“They live in the sea, in the bot- 
tom probably, because Aey can’t 
sec. They communicate by electri- 
city. They probably evolved from 
creatures like earth’s electric eels.” 
“What about the perches? How 
can they climb around on those?” 
“They’re not like ordinary fish. 
Remember, even on earth there are 
things like octopus or . .” 

A splash sounded from the wat- 
er-filled street. In the last dim light 
Acy could vaguely see a wave de- 



STRONG CURREKf 



83 




vclop as something large gathered 
velocity just under the surface, and 
suddenly a huge white shape hurtled 
from the water and wrapped its 
twenty foot tentacles around the 
first two or three metal perches, 
proceeding from there with a pon- 
derous grace the top of the 
building, where it disap;'>eared. It 
seemed to consist of a K)ng semi- 
flexible body, bluntly curv, d at one 
end and at the other end split into 
a number of nionstrous tentacles. 

Doi finished his sentence hesi- 
tantly, “ . or like squid.” 

CiT’m glad you figured it out when 

X you did,” Skinner said. “I’m 
not sure I would have tumbled to 
it for a while.” They sat together 
in one of the largest Toran labora- 
tories, out of the way of the Tor- 
anites, who were working on some 
elaborate piece of equipment. A 
dim light illumined the misty, cold 
room. Toranites worked with pre- 
cision and effortless strength on 
great accumulations of equipment, 
hanging from roof or wall perches 
to get at machines dozens of feet 
in the air, though sometimes they 
seemed balked at the more minute 
mechanical details. Skinner went 
on. 

“I got so I could move the raft 
around all. right. I attached a long 
rod to the gravity knob for a more 
delicate control, and I found that 
by grappling on roofs I could pull 
the raft where I wanted it. But 
then I followed those big squids — 
Toranites — and set the translator 
microphone to deciphering their 
twitterings, jibbers, and squeaks, 



which I guess are just sort of sound- 
ing apparatus. Lord knows how 
long it would have been before I 
just took the microphone off its 
leads and pushed the leads right up 
against the beast’s skin.” 

Bannan seemed about to say 
something cynical but he restrained 
himself. “How did you figure it 
out” Skinner asked Doi. Doi ex- 
plained. 

‘I thought they must be sea crea- 
tures because of the water in the 
streets. I couldn’t see how they 
could be birds, as Bannan suggest- 
ed, or land animals with rowboats. 
For one thing, if they came from 
the land and used boats in the 
streets, as in Venice, there would 
have been ways to get to the city 
from the outside — roads, perhaps. 
But the only way is the sea. 

“And if they came from the sea 
that would also explain why there 
was only this one city above the 
ocean’s surface. It’s one of a kind 
— most of their activities are car- 
ried out in the sea. I tried to imagine 
what use they would have for a 
land city, and I decided that one 
would be scientific research. Sure 
enough, the first building we en- 
tered was jam full of scientific 
apparatus. I imagine most of it is 
either equipment that won’t work 
under water or specifically investi- 
gates climate and other above-sea 
conditions. 

“There was something else that 
struck me, and that was the lack 
of anything that indicated that they 
could see. There was no meters, 
calendars, papers, any evidence they 
had any kind of visual writing. The 



•4 



IP 




incisions in the steel balls were hard 
to see, because there was no ink in 
the incisions. What was more, all 
the equipment was functioning, but 
there was no one around — maybe 
they came at night; maybe in fact 
the light bothered them,” he paused. 

4CTf they couldn’t see, how could 
A they handle a technology such 
as the one we’re looking at? The 
immediate answer would be sound 
and touch, and they obviously have 
both of those. Touch is essential, 
and the ability to hear is indicated 
by the speaker hitched up to that 
phonograph. 

“But it seemed a little thin for 
them to have such a technology 
based only on touch and some tre- 
mendously complicated languages. 
Then I remembered three things — 
exposed leads attached to the pho- 
nograph; the absence of any other 
speakers throughout the building we 
investigated, although it had many 
wire recorders; and those large in- 
struments on tc^ of the building and 
in it, shaped something like large 
(fivans. It struck me that those 
things would be ideal for holding 
some large body in front of selected 
banks of instruments, though it 
would expose diat body to chang- 
ing potentials. Why? And also, why 
the exposed leads? Obviously, die 
creatures somehow could fed 
changes in electricity with high sen- 
sitivity. Maybe they were like elec- 
tric eels, and could to some ex- 
tent produce it themselves, and 
perhaps it was less effort for them 
to buy it, as from the vending 
machine. 



“I wasn’t absolutely sure of all 
this, of course, but it seemed a 
fairly complete picture and one 
worth trying.” 

“Very good,” squawked the 
translator box. They looked around 
and saw that its microphone leads 
ran to a motionless Toranite twenty 
feet away. “I’ve been listening, and 
I applaud your insight. You are 
substantially right on all the im- 
portant points. Actually, we do 
have eyes, but compared to yours 
they have low resolution and high 
sensitivity, being evolved to detect 
luminous creatures in the depths of 
the sea. You notice the faint glow 
by which we are working. You may 
have thought that was arranged f<MT 
you but actually we always use 
light of about that intensity. 

“But that is a niggling point and 
I must congratulate you on an 
astute realization of the situation. I 
can hardly imagine a stranger set 
of circumstances for creatures such 
as yourselves. 

“And now, our arrangements for 
you. You will be pleased to learn 
that we have finished our tempor- 
ary interstellar radio and have sent 
a distress signal to Agan Redan, 
where there is a scout base. You 
can expect that in about seven of 
your hours, or at midday tomorrow, 
you win be rescued.” 

T he scouts relaxed. After a short 
silence Doi spoke. 

“There is something that has been 
bothering me. The translator has 
been giving us English in an ir- 
regular, jerky rhythm. Is your lan- 
guage delivered in short bursts?” 



STRONG CURRENT 



85 




*‘No. It can be delivered at al- 
most any rate we choose. I’ve been 
listening to the translator pronounce 
English and I’ve attempted to feed 
k Toran in such a way that it pro- 
du CCS English of the sort I’m accus- 
tomed to. We have a recording of 
iome spoken English here, in fact 
you stumbled onto it — a disk with 
grooves, a priceless relic of the first 
discovery of this planet by the Ga- 
lactic Federation. I have spent hours 
listening curiously to that thing, re- 
flecting on its deeper mysteries. I 
had thought I could manipulate 
your translator somehow so that it 
would give the speech rhythm used 
by the humans recorded on the disk, 
but your translator is an obstinate 
•ort of device. It has a mind of its 
own. 

“We have only the rest of to- 
night to exchange information, how- 
tver, and you gentlemen must be 
tired. So allow me to put to you 
•cveral small questions about the 
Federation, about which I am very 
curious. Unless, of course, any of 
you have any more questions?” 

“I have one,” said Doi. “Is elec- 
tric current expensive here?” 

“Yes. In fact, our prices are out- 
rageoi s for our technology, though 
Aey will soon go down when we 
•tart our reactors. Until now it has 
been very difficult to manufacture.” 
“Was the vending machine I saw 
a vendor of raw electricity?” 

“Yes. It is for those who feel de- 
pleted and don’t wish to spend a 



day in seclusicm restoring charge,” 
the Toran answered. 

“Then why are the metal bars 
leading up the sides of buildings 
carriers of a strong current? It looks 
to me as if anyone can tap it who 
wants.” 

“Anyone can. Those bars are the 
symptoms of a free economy, demo- 
cratic and with an emphasis of free 
enterprise. There are those who ob- 
ject to them, insisting they are an- 
noying, insulting, and cynically com- 
mercial, but most, like me, re- 
gard them as healthy symptoms of 
our competitive economy. This is a 
public building and there is such a 
bar just behind me. I’ll attach the 
translator leads to it and you can 
see for yourselves, although 1 don’t 
imagine the translator will be able 
to handle many of our idioms.” 

There was silence and abruptly 
the translator squawked again. Ban- 
nan turned bright red; it seemed to 
him a crowning insult that the cur- 
rent that had flowed through him 
should have been a voice, which, in 
spite of the deadpan squawk of the 
translator, had that queasy, ingra- 
tiating, glad-handed tone that in 
long years on crowded earth he had 
come to know so well: 

“Friends! Have your tentacles 
been feeling stiff lately? Has vour 
brrrp-sack lost its resilience? For 
pure, pullulating sliminess, for un- 
equalled brrrp, no ungeunt can beat 
BRRRP, the brrrps your brrrp with

IHE ALTAR 

hf JOHN BRUNNER 

AT ASGOHEl 



fflustrotMl by /AORROW 



The fair world of Asconel had 
been ravaged by a man, a woman 
— and Someone who was neither! 



H orrorstruck visions raced 
through Spartak’s mind in three 
fuccessive and distinct stages. 

First, there was the appallingly 
vivid picture of them all condemned 
to serve the whim of this mentally 
unstable girl, slaves bound with un- 
seen chains, compelled to take her 



on a colossal joyride around the 
wheel of stars which was the galaxy. 
Second, there came a flood o< 
memories of Asconel: its seas, its 
mountains, its forests and open 
plains, every recollection painfnl 
with yearning. He had resigned him- 
self long ago to a life of exile, but 



88 





What Has Gone Before 

Asconel has been taken over by someone — or something! — that threatens 
Id destroy a hard-working people and a good way of life. The three broth- 
ers of its former ruler, Hodat, who has been slain by the usurpers, are 
AsconePs only hope. Spartak has given up the life of action for the con- 
templative existence of a monklike scholar. That idyll is destroyed when 
Vix descends on his peaceful existence with the tale of the rape of their 
home world. The two half-brothers start for Asconel in Vix's spaceships 
but on the way stop at Delcadore where the third brother of the murdered 
ruler, Tiorin, may be found. 

They find their brother, but at a cost. For while they are waiting, a high 
official of Delcadore commandeers them and their ship for a frightful 
errand. They are ordered to take a mutant girl, Eunora, to the edge of 
the galaxy — and abandon her. 

They are able to overcome the hypnotic compulsion that would make 
them carry out these orders — but only through rtie help of the girl. And 
then she too takes over their minds. They are her slaves, ^Ipless as children 
before her mutant brain. 



since Vix came to find him he had 
conceived an ache to go home that 
now permeated every fiber of his 
being. The agony of deprivation 
was almost physical, like hunger — 
more nearly like sex. 

And third, as he began to bring 
his whirling thoughts under control, 
followed the shadow of a question. 
Could even Eunora, who had cer- 
tainly released them from the Im- 
perial conditioning, reverse the pro- 
cess with her supernatural talent, im- 
posing fresh commands in place of 
those she had wiped out? Could 
she? 

No one said anything. He and his 
half-brothers simply stared at Eu- 
nora, as though her tiny face and 
body held an infinite fascination for 
them. Bit by bit, the waiting grew 
to be a strain on her, and the ex- 



pression of mocking triumph she 
wore gave place to a look of un- 
certainty. 

At last she burst out, “Do as I 
tell you! Do as I tdl you!” But the 
words were tinged with hysteria. 

Behind her shoulder, Spartak saw 
Vineta move. She came forward in- 
to the middle of the control room 
floor, and spoke unexpectedly in a 
level voice. 

“I want to go to Asconel. Because 
that’s where Vix wants to go.” 

“Shut up!” Eunora rounded on 
her, the skin around her eyes crink- 
ling up as though she were about to 
cry. 

Murmurs of astonishment came 
from Vix and Tiorin. Spartak was 
not less surprised than they at 
Vineta’s intervention, but he was 
perhaps better equipped to see how 



THE ALTAR AT ASCOKEL

it was possible than they were. He 
forced his thinking along the most 
promising line, remembering that 
Eunora was exposed to all of them 
at once 

D eliberately he fanned the coals 
of his resentment into flame, 
visualizing her as she had been when 
she was brought to the ship — 
corpse-stiff, kept alive only by ma- 
chines, suffering unspeakable cramps 
and soreness. 

Is this how you repay our help? 
he whispered wordlessly inside his 
head. And beyond that, more sub- 
tly: Is this the life you want, for 
years, forever perhaps — the loneli- 
ness of power, without love, with- 
out friendship and trust? 

‘‘Stop it!” she whimpered, and 
dashed at him to beat with her little 
absurd fists on his chest. He folded 
his arms and stared sternly down 
at her. 

Once you begin it, you can never 
stop. And behind the thought, care- 
fully constructed pictures of face- 
less people, by hundreds and then 
by thousands, plotting to escape 
from her control and drive her 
down to final darkness. 

“Stop it!” she shrieked again. 

He complied, and thought in- 
stead of Asconel, a fair world, hos- 
pitable and kindly, with himself and 
Vix and Tiorin and Eunora too en- 
joying . its sunshine, its wine, its 
fields and cities. 

Helpless, the girl bent over and 
covered her face with her hands. 
The threatened onslaught of tears 
overcame her. Impulsively, Vineta 
put her arm around her shoulders. 



and she turned and buried her sobs 
in the long dark hair. 

“What — what happened?” Vix 
whispered, moving as though wak- 
ing from nightmare. 

“I wouldn’t be surprised if Vineta 
could tell you,” Spartak answered 
slowly. “You’ve been underestimat- 
ing this girl of yours, Vix! She 
thinks very clearly indeed.” 

Vineta, comforting the weeping 
Eunora, shook her head. “T only 
know what store Vix sets by going 
to Asconel. And I couldn’t bear to 
think of him — and all of you — 
being turned into toys for /zer.” 
“And there you have it,” Spar- 
tak grunted. “Eunora found it easy 
to release the conditioning the Im- 
perial psychologists imposed on us. 
But to implant new commands of 
her own against the terrible need 
we all have to go home and set 
our people free — that’s not some- 
thing one untrained child can 
achieve!” 

“But — ” Vix started to object. 
“But never mind how it was 
done,” Tiorin snapped, wiping sweat 
from his furrowed brow. “The ques- 
tion is, how do we cope with her 
from now on? If she’s apt to repeat 
that performance — ” 

“Dump her in space,” Vix said 
shortly. The naked brutality of the 
words jolted all of them, and espe- 
cially Eunora, who spun in terror to 
gaze at him. 

“That’s disgusting, Vix!” Tiorin 
countered. “Nonetheless — since 
you’re free of the compulsion to 
take her to Nylock, I think we 
should put her down on the nearest 
habitable planet.”

,, "I . Vineta let the word hang 

tfmidly in the air. 

“Go on, Vineta. You’re a clear 
thinker than most people. I’d be in- 
terested to hear your view.” 

■ “Well . .” Vineta licked her lips. 
“Fve heard from Vix that this mys- 
terious woman Lydis gained power 
over your late brother Hodat by ap- 
pearing to read his thoughts. And 
what I’ve heard, too, about the way 
the people of Asconel have been 
changed from free independent citi- 
zens to blind fanatic dupes of the 
Belizuek cult sounds like the effect 
of some sort of conditioning. I — 
well, I didn’t have a very happy 
childhood. Even though I wasn’t set 
apart from everybody the way Eu- 
Bora is, I often felt the way she did 
just now — desperate to get even 
with the universe, wanting to be as 
cruel to others as they had been to 
me. So I can’t be angry with her. 

“And — ” she hesitated — “I can’t 
see into your minds the way she 
can, but I do believe that you’re 
the nicest people I’ve ever had to 
deal with. Vix, for all that you have 
a temper like a star going nova, you 
can be very kind, and Spartak here 
is such a gentle person, and strong 
inside too. I think perhaps when 
she’s recovered from the dreadful 
things they did to her on Delcadore, 
Eunora will see that the same as I 
do. And when she does — well, isn’t 
it going to be tremendously valuable 
to have someone with us who can 
see into people’s inmost thoughts?” 

T here was a pause. Tiorin spoke. 

“I see what Spartak means 
about you, girL” 



l^artak drew a deep breath. “I’d 
be willing to try, if she'll co-oper- 
ate.” 

Eunora gave a little frightened 
cry. “I see what’s in your mind, 
Spartak! No! No!” 

No? His sober bearded face benl 
close to hers, he let himself think 
through the idea in detail, trying to 
maintain the same mood in which 
he had taken his vows to the order 
he joined on Annanworld: the sense 
of disgust inspired by the stupid 
violence attending the collapse of 
Imperial authority, the longing for 
rationality, calm judgment and 
peace which drove him to his self- 
imposed exile. 

But it wasn’t that, he realized 
later, which impressed her. It was 
the memory of the agony he suffer- 
ed while waiting for the antidote to 
be brought so that he could re- 
lease her from the painful catatone 
paralysis. 

“I don’t like this,” Vix muttered 
in the background. “I still feel we’d 
be better off if we simply got rid of 
her.” 

“Wait,” Tiorin counseled. “Look 
now!” 

With an expression of total child- 
like trust, she had put her tiny hand 
in Spartak’s large one, and he was 
leading her without another word 
from the control room. 

W hen Spartak returned, much 
later, his face was stamped 
with incredible weariness. 

“She’s sleeping,” he said in an- 
swer to an eager question from Tio- 
rin. “Oh, but I’ve dug some foulness 
from that mind of hers! Like seek- 



92 



IF 




ing jewels ki a manure pile of 
dungl” 

Vix demanded harshly, “What did 
you do?” 

“Hm?” Rubbing his eyes, Spar- 
tak spoke around a yawn. “Oh — I 
gave her some of the same drug I 
used on Korisu. I told you it was 
employed in psychotherapy. Before 
she’s capable of liking us, or any- 
one, she’s got to be cleansed of the 
hate she’s conceived for the human 
race. And are you surprised at that 
hate? The Empire, afraid of being 
toppled by some superiorly gifted 
assailant, made it policy to deport 
mutants. And Ac common people 
turned that policy into fear for Acir 
own security. You’d stand up to a 
raving crowd, defying them wiA 
your gun — or a sword, or your 
bare fists if it came to that. But 
she’s a child! How can she under- 
stand and forgive a mob of fools 
driven out of their minds with su- 
perstitious terror?” 

Vix hesitated for a long moment. 
Finally he shrugged. “I don’t like 
Ae idea, but — but you know a few 
Aings I don’t, having spent so long 
with your nose buried in your books. 
So far, things have turned out well 
for us. I’ll go along wiA you. But 
if she pulls another trick like the 
one she scared us with, I’ll dump 
her in space!” 

“Well said,” Tiorin approved. 
“Now, though, we have a choice to 
make, Spartak. Vix feels we should 
go direct to Asconel, for fear of 
wasting any more time. I think it 
would be safer to try and contact 
Tigrid Zen on Gwo. Things have 
changed terribly on Asconel; even 



if we disguise ourselves, we mighi 
be betrayed by some chance ignop- 
ance.” 

“But will Tigrid Zen be any bel- 
ter informed?” Vix challenged. “H 
Ae stories we hear about Bucyon^ 
mastery of Asconel are correct, he 
won’t simply be able to come and 
go freely. He may not even have 
been able to land ships at home. 
And someone who’s totally cut ofl 
can’t give tn much guidance.” 

“I’ll give you one soimd reasoa 
for skipping Owe,” Spartak sakL 
“We cannot wm our cause on Gwo. 
We can only wA on Asconel.” 
“Ascend it is Aen,” Tiorin mul- 
tered, and moved to the contrds.

N ow that the time of Aeir homo- 
coming was finally upon Aem, 
Aey were overtaken by a sense ot 
estrangement which was irrationally 
reinforced by Ae disguises SparhA 
had prepared. He had some con- 
fidence in his beard and Ae passage 
of ten years to change him; none- 
Aeless, he had altered his hair-color 
to blond, Tiorin’s and Vix’s boA 
to jet-black, worked delicately over 
Ae line of chin and eyebrow and 
nose wiA soft inert substances in- 
jected below Ae skin, till Ae ro- 
semblance between all Aree of them 
and Hodat’s brothers reduced to a 
similarity of stature and gait. 

That would have to suffice. 
Would have to. 

But Ae physical illusion com- 
bined wiA a feeling Aat each was 
retreating into a universe of priv-

not follow. In a desperate attempt 
to retain their newly refound kin- 
ship even Vix — warily supervising 
the controls, ever aler‘ for Bucyon’s 
forces watching the space around 
Asconcl for intruders — was driven 
to speak at random for the sake of 
breaking the tension. 

“It’s winter down there,” he mut- 
tered. 

“We’ll have to get some warmer 
clothing,” Spartak agreed, “especial- 
ly for Eunora, who has nothing.” 

“T wasn’t thinking of that.” Vix 
shrugged. “If there’s snow on the 
ground, it’ll be much harder to land 
without leaving tracks.” 

Tiorin made to speak, hesitated, 
finally gave a bitter laugh. “I was 
just about to ask where we should 
buy our clothing and whether it 
would be safe to show our Imperial 
currency. But it suddenly struck me 
that we’ll be lucky to find anyone 
with clothing to sell even in a 
town.” 

“Aren’t you exaggerating?” Vix 
said. 

“I doubt if he is,” Spartak put 
in. “The entire planet will be shock- 
ingly changed, Vix. Production, dis- 
tribution, communications — all re- 
duced to the bare minimum needed 
to support Belizuek’s domination. 
Rags will have become precious, and 
to throw away a crust of bread will 
be unthinkable. Typically, itil be 
safe enough to show Imperial cur- 
rency, and what’s more it’ll buy in- 
credible quantities of anything that’s 
for sale. But our own money will 
have become effectively worthless.” 

“Then how can people five?” Vix 
demanded savagely. 



V ineta spoke up from the corner 
of the control room in which 
she huddled with Eunora; being 
close to her own childhood, she had 
established a sort of shy intimacy 
with the mutant girl. “Vix, you’ve 
seen how it is on worlds we’ve 
travelled to with your order. They 
live like beasts, ready to fight for 
a morsel of food, neglecting every- 
thing but the sheer necessity of stay- 
ing alive.” 

“I guess so,” Vix sighed. “But I 
can’t transfer what I’ve seen on 
worlds like Batyra Dap to my own 
beloved Asconel.” 

His fingers curled like claws, as 
if he had Bucyon’s throat between 
them. 

Spartak said hastily, “We’re 
agreed at least on what we do at 
first, aren’t we? We land as Vix 
recommends on the southerly tip of 
the island on which stands the town 
of Penwyr. There’s a concealed site 
for the shjp; the people stood loyal 
to our father while Vix was putting 
down the rebels; there’s a temple 
at Penwyr, the only one on the is- 
land; and it’s — well, if not easy, 
at any rate possible to get to Pen- 
wyr on foot, so that we run the least 
risk of being reported and attract- 
ing the attention of the priesthood. 
Once arrived, we go directly to the 
temple and try to find out what 
Belizuek is behind these screens 
which always hide him. If we must, 
we’ll kidnap a priest and interrogate 
him back at the ship. Meantime, 
Eunora will tell us which of the 
people we meet still harbor the seeds 
of resistance to Belizuek, and we’ll 
sound out those we feel we can truit

lo guide our Kv.T-reim p^inning.** 
“Can we just wedk into the tem- 
ple?’^ Tiorin asked. “I know every- 
one has to go there daily — ” 

“It’s not quite like that,” Spartak 
corrected. “Every mornin^r there’s a 
ceremony to honor Belizuek, but 
®ot all the citizens are required to 
4c daily homage. In towns they are 
«pected to go to the temple one 
day out of three; in the country, 
one day in six. But it seems not to 
be looked on as a duty; it’s one of 
the great events in lives which have 
become uniformly drab and de- 
pressing. Accordingly, the temples 
•re open all day, from dawn to 
dusk, so that people with particular- 
ly fervent adoration for Belizuek 
can go and prostrate themselves.” 
“What do they do at these sacri- 
fices?” Vineta put in. 

Vix said, “Every twenty or thirty 
days there’s a special ceremony at 
which the volunteers are decked 
with flowers and walk behind the 
temple screen to the sound of joy- 
ful music.” 

His face darkened. “What be- 
comes of them, nobody knows ex- 
cept the priests. But they are never 
seen alive again.” 

“Are they seen dead, then?” Tio- 
rin growled. “Served as the main 
dish at a banquet, maybe?” 

“What time of day will it be when 
we set down?” Snartak asked. 

“Around sunrise. If we make 
haste, we can reach Penwyr just in 
time for the morning ceremony at 
the temple.” Vix scanned his con- 
trol panel closely, and gave a nod. 
•*1 think we can go to land without 
being challenged. Here’s hoping!” 



T he lock door slid aside. Beyond 
lay a bleak, forbidding land- 
scape: gray rocks, with the white- 
ness of drihed snow, skewered with 
the trunks of leafless trees of which 
the crowns were just catching the 
first rays of dawn, ^ere was no 
sound except the distant noise of 
the sea, gnashing its teeth. The air 
was bitterly cold. 

But it wasn’t the sudden chill 
which made Spartak shiver and 
brought the tears stinging to his 
eyes. It was the sum of all his 
childhood memories. 

Asconel! Mother of us all that 
you should be brutally raped and 
betrayed! 

His emotion choked him, and by 
the long silence he knew his broth- 
ers were equally overcome. 

The first voice to disturb the cold 
morning was Eunora’s. Scarcely 
louder than a whisper, it said : “For- 
give me, all of you. If I could have 
seen the love you have for your 
home, I’d not have frightened you 
by threatening to make you — make 
you — ” 

She could not finish, but they all 
knew what she meant, and they gave 
her frosty smiles in acceptance of 
her apology. 

“We must move,” Tiorin said 
practically. “Vix, you’ll need to in- 
activate the ship, fit alarms and 
boobytraps — ?” 

“It’s as easy as turning a switch,” 
Vix cut in. “The owners who had 
my ship before were all suspicious 
people. When we close her up no 
one but ourselves will be able to 
get within arm’s length of the hull. 
In any case, no one comes to this

part of rhe island. No hunting, no 
fishing worth the name — no rea- 
son for visitors.” 

He patted his chest, making sure 
he had his concealed sidearm, and 
led the way down the ladder to the 
ground. 

They picked a route to leave the 
fewest possible tracks, going first 
by rocky slopes from which the 
snow had blown away, then by a 
road which had been used since the 
last fall, where there were already 
plenty of footmarks. It all seemed 
very straight forward, and Spartak 
might have relaxed, but for the 
freezing cold. 

They had walked the better part 
of an hour when there was a sharp 
exclamation from Vix, leading the 
way. 

The others hurried to see what 
he had found. He had halted op- 
posite a form half-buried by snow 
in the meager shelter of a bush. 

“He’s dead,” he said slowly, and 
the others, shocked, saw that this 
was indeed a man — very old for 
his beard was not white only with 
frost. He must have sat down to 
rest here while trudging the road, 
and never got up again. 

Spartak exhaled sharply, his 
breath wreathing in the icy air. 
“Well, he has no further use for 
what little he possessed,” he grunt- 
ed, and began without more ado to 
strip the clothing from the corpse. 
Tiorin made to object, and he gave 
him a glare. “If you’re going to be 
squeamish, perhaps you’d rather 
strip yourself and lend the clothes 
to Eunora?” 

When he’d finished, she was so 



grotesque in the miscellaneous rag^ 
he had supplied that Vix looked 
doubtful. “Can we really go into 
Penwyr with her dressed like that?** 
“You’re fond of betting,” Spar- 
tak answered. “I’ll bet that most of 
the people we meet will be worse 
clad yet.” 

With a last surge of energy he 
put the fragile corpse out of sight 
in a bank of snow beyond the bush 
where it had rested, and they tramp- 
ed on. 

H is estimate of the condition of 
people in Penwyr was correct. 
They began to encounter the citi- 
zens on the road just before entering 
the town. This was a day for folk 
from outlying farms to attend the 
temple ceremony. They were gather- 
ing on foot and in wheezing old 
groundcars fueled with wood-gas 
generator^. None of them offered 
to speak to Spartak and his com- 
panions, which suited them well. 

Two things appalled Spartak 
especially: first, the numbers on 
foot — for Asconel had been among 
the few worlds retaining nuclear- 
powered transport after the with- 
drawal of Imperial support. And sec- 
ond, the looks of near-ecstasy on 
all the faces. Even the children, 
some of whom one would have ex- 
pected to be sullen and fractious, 
were uniformly cheerful. 

In the town, placards depicting 
Bucyon and Lydis were ever3rwhere, 
mostly on the fronts of stores long 
closed for lack of goods to sell. 
Several people in the now large 
crowd heading for the temple 
paused to kiss the pictures. 



96 



IP 




Wary, eyes taking in every detail 
around, they let themselves be car- 
ried along until they were in sight 
of the temple itself. Originally it 
must have been the island’s agri- 
cultural produce mart, a low-roofed 
building several hundred feet square. 
Now it was decked with Bucyon’s 
picture and many crude slogans. The 
crowd paused as it entered the street 
on which the temple stood and join- 
ed with other streams of people 
from elsewhere in the town, giving 
Spartak time to read some of the 
gaudv exhortations: 

WE ARE BORN AND WE DTE, 
BUT BEUZUEK GOES ON FOR- 
EVER! 

BEFORE THE GALAXY BELI- 
ZUEK WAS! 

MANKIND ARE ANIMALS 
BUT BEUZUEK IS AN IMPEN- 
ETRABLE MYSTERY! 

Spartak tried to keep the grim 
look of hatred from his face as he 
shuffled his feet to warm them on 
the frozen "round. When he felt 
a nudge, he thought at first it was 
Eunora huddling close to him for 
shelter against the cold wind, but 
it was Tiorin who had pressed up 
in order to whisper. 

“Spartak, you’ve noticed the — 
the joy with 'which all these people 
are going to the temple?” 

Spartak nodded. 

“It terrifies me,” Tiorin breathed. 
“Spartak, what makes us think that 
we can resist Belizuek ourselves? 
How do we know that we’re not 
walking into his jaws by coming to 
his temple? How do we know when 
we come out we won’t be his will- 
ing slaves for the rest of our lives?” 



xvn 

'T^he echo of Tiorin’s depressing 
suggestion made Spartak’s head 
ring like a gong as they were car- 
ried willy-nilly forward in the crowd. 

It was far too late now to change 
their minds about entering the tem- 
ple. The people pressed on every 
side, eager to get out of the cold 
and into the steamy warnith of the 
building. He wish^ achingly that 
Eunora could speak directly to his 
mind, telling him what she was pick- 
ing up from those around. But she 
could not, and after Tiorin’s brief 
whisper there were too many other 
people too close for any more priv- 
ate conversation. 

Wondering what was going on in- 
side the mutant girl’s head, Spartak 
used the advantage his height gave 
to peer around and seek clues to 
the grip Belismek exerted on his 
disciples. None offered themselves. 
He saw, heard and smelt a horde of 
dirty, hungry wretches, who seemed 
to find their plight perfectly na- 
tural and indeed enjoyable. 

Drug addiction. The concept 
thrust itself out of a corner of 
memory. It was apposite. He had 
only rarely seen victims of an un- 
controllable addiction, but they bore 
the same stamp of single-minded 
urgency as the people surrounding 
him. 

He began to make guesses, putting 
himself into the place of the people 
here. People who had failed to see 
the necessity for starting over from 
their own resources when the Em- 
pire withdrew its economic and 
military support 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



97 




To such a person, after thousands 
of years of Imperial domination, the 
idea of Asconel making its own way 
would be literally inconceivable 
And since the Empire was human, 
what more logical conclusion than 
that man was unworthy? 

He shook his head. It was only 
half an explanation. 

They were coming to the door 
now. Spartak felt his nape tingle as 
he sought for any intrusion on his 
mind — any process comparable to 
conditioning which might turn him 
too into a loyal disciple of the 
greedy deity. But it was useless; he 
could not tell. 

Clutching Eunora’s tiny hand, try- 
ing to keep within arm’s reach of his 
brothers, he was forced into the 
temple. 

There was little remarkable about 
it. There were no seats; the people 
were supposed to pack in shoulder 
to shoulder and stand during the 
ceremony. The walls were decorated 
with prized personal possessions — 
paintings, sculptures, tapestries and 
objects in precious metal — de- 
scribed on small attached plaques 
as voluntary donations by adorers of 
Belizuek. 

The screen at the far end, behind 
which Belizuek was allegedly con- 
cealed, was not, as he had envis- 
aged, some curtain of force akin to 
the defensive field of a starship. It 
was just a screen of woven metal 
links on a frame adorned with gems. 

More than likely, it would carry 
a killing charge. 

He got his first sight of the priests 
now: wearing robes not unlike those 
affected by his own order on An- 
ts 



nanworld, but in various colors, 
black, white, green and gold. They 
stood watching the congregation 
assemble. 

Was there any clue to their origin 
in their physique? He studied them, 
and concluded that they might as 
easily have been born on Asconel 
as any other world of the galaxy. 
The traffic of the Empire mixed all 
the existing human stocks. 

T he eyes of one priest seemed to 
dwell on him. He repressed a 
start of alarm. 

Glancing around, he decided that 
there was nothing to mark them out 
as unusual — many of the men were 
taller than himself, many of the 
children were smaller and younger 
than Eunora. If the priest was cur- 
ious, it could only be because He 
did not immediately recognize them. 
It would be wise to slip away after 
the ceremony, delaying their return 
to the empty temple until, perhaps, 
the curious priest would not be 
around. 

The last of the crowd from the 
street jammed in through the doors; 
the doors closed; there was an air 
of expectancy. All at once, a note 
of music sounded apparently from 
nowhere, and the assembly broke 
into a fervent chant of praise for 
Belizuek. 

Moving his mouth in imitation of 
the rest, he saw that all eyes were 
riveted on the screen behind which 
was Belizuek. 

A reason for the unison singing 
came to him: to weld the crowd 
together, making it more susceptible 
to the priests’ appeals. But so far 

IF 




he couldn’t detect any more advanc- 
ed methods working on the people’s 
minds — no hypnotically rhythmic 
lighting effects, no airborne drugs. 

Of course, they might be too subtle 
for even an aware victim to notice. 

The chanting ended. A priest 
came out before the screen and 
turned his back on the congregation. 
There was a pause. He bowed, and 
everyone bowed with him — Spartak 
and his companions fractionally late. 

Again? No. One bow sufficed. 

The priest turned, the people 
hanging on every movement, and 
began to address them in ringing 
tones. His theme was what Spartak 
had expected. Belizuek was a super- 
ior being. Men could have no higher 
purpose than his service. This desire 
should supersede all personal ain- 
bitions. 

Spartak let his attention wander. 

So far, he’d seen and heard noth- 
ing to account for the blind obedi- 
ence of once-rational persons. He 
was jolted back to awareness with 
boundless amazement when a yell 
went up from the body of the hall. 

**Proof!” someone shouted. And 
another voice, a woman’s: ‘‘Proof!” 

The priest, unperturbed, contin- 
ued on his former subject. The 
voices resumed, now swelling, until 
the discourse could hardly be made 
out, and Spartak wondered if he 
ought to join in himself for fear of 
exciting notice if he remained silent. 
He was on the point of doing so 
when the priest raised a hand. 

The shouting stopped as if a 
switch had been turned. 

"Proof you want,” the priest in- 
toned. ‘‘Proof you shall have!” He 



turned to face the screen again, 
bowing mm^ deeply than before. 

‘‘Belizuek! We who are dess than 
dust beseech a revelation of your 
majesty!” 

And Spartak learned the answers 
to all his questions. 

A t first, it was merely as tihough 
the temple had grown larger, 
the walls receding into a misty dis- 
tance and beginning to glow. With 
a shock, a sense of perspective over- 
took him. Those walls were the 
very bounds of the universe, and 
the faint glow was the light of stars 
— countless in number, inconceiv- 
ably far away. 

Then there was a pause which 
had the still quality of eternity. 
Nothing moved, nothing changed. 

Seeping in, then, like water oozing 
through porous rock, came a sense 
of presence. Personality. Conscious- 
ness. 

And power! 

Somewhere in this monstrous emp- 
tiness, perhaps as far off as the dim 
stars, perhaps further, a being had 
come into existence to the reach of 
whose mind the gap between galaxies 
was no more than a single stride. 
As though drawn by a magnet, Spar- 
tak’s dissociated awareness began 
the eon-long plunge through no- 
where to find it and pay his hom- 
age. 

Out of the misty blur of stars 
a form took shape: a lens. The lens 
of this familiar galaxy. 

Chance glimpses occurred of well- 
known features: the Big Dark, which 
some freak of stellar drift had 
notched like a sawcut into the galac-

tic rim, a tiundred li^t-years i^ide; 
Ac pattern of globular diKters nick- 
nafTied the Eyes of Argus for the 
mufHtude and brilliance of them. 
By now. the other galaxies filling 
tbe plenum had dwindled to their 
customary status of bright blobs on 
the black curtain of infinity. 

But the presence knew them. The 
preseirce was aware of everything, 
from the least bacterium to the pat- 
tern of those vanishing galaxies; 
had sounded and plumbed the fur- 
thest void, had weighed and measur- 
ed the nucleons of the atom. It 
*Wd” so 

What petty human could contra- 
dict such a declaration? 

For it knew all human history, 
and felt such contempt as made any 
man wriggle with embarrassment 
for these squabbling, greedy half- 
hildligent creatures which had stolen 
the techniques and artifacts of their 
greater predecessors and claimed the 
conquest of the galaxy. To what 
end? To the downfall of their vaunt- 
ed Empire, and the return of the 
■pedes on tens of thousands of 
worlds to a state no better than the 
■Mid-grubbing life of beasts! 

E ven when it was over, the vision 
still filled his head and dazzled 
his eyes. He was passive among the 
crowd that, forced its way from the 
temple, letting himself be pushed 
hack on the street 

His questions had been answered, 
end in a way he had not expected. 
The shock had dazed him. 

Someone tried to claim his atten- 
hon. He shook his head and went on 
teinking about what he had learned. 



The person — Tiorin, possibly — 
gave up in annoyance and turned to 
someone else: Eunora. 

He wasn’t interested in what was 
being said. All that concerned him 
was in his memory. 

It was much later that he realized 
he was being escorted along a street 
floored with dirty snow, his com- 
panions beside him. He was shiver- 
ing, having failed to fasten his cloth- 
ing about him when he left the hot 
overcrowded temple. Ahead, some- 
one was walking fast with occasional 
backward glances that suggested 
anxiety. 

“Where are we going?” he forced 
out. 

“You’re with us again?” Tiorin 
came eagerly to his side. “I was 
afraid you’d been taken like these 
unfortunate wretches.” 

“Hm? Qh! Oh, yes. I guess I 
was.” The reference drove him back 
inside himself, his eyes uhfocusing 
and hifi feet stumbling occasionally 
on the rock-hard snow. 

“The man ahead,” Tiorin explain- 
ed, thinking Spartak was still listen- 
ing. “Vix recognized him from the 
campaign he fought here. Says he 
was a loyal and brave soldier. And 
Eunora got close enough to tell that 
he’s still trying to resist Bucyon, 
only goes to the temple because he’d 
risk exposure if he didn’t. We plan 
to follow until we get him alone 
and can approach him openly.” 

But Spartak was lost again in the 
depths between the galaxies, playing 
over in his mind the vision he had 
had of supernal power, monstrous 
intelligence — and indescribable con- 
ceit. 




xvin 



J ike most towns in Asconel’s 
northern hemisphere, Penwyr 
relied largely on water-borne trans- 
port; it was unusual, however, in 
being built astride a river instead of 
on the coast. They continued to fol- 
low the man whom Vix recognized 
until he reached the embankment 
paralleling the river, by which time 
they were sure he would take the 
bridge to the other side of the town, 
a quarter of low-built, rather mean 
houses. 

He was becoming frightened by 
then, however, and had quickened 
his pace so much that it looked as 
if he might break into a run at 
any moment. People were about the 
river’s edge, some Inspecting boats 
moored to rings in the stone wall, 
some working on repairs, some 
merely leaning over and watching. 
It was a choice between losing their 
quarry if he ran, and attracting a 
good deal of undesirable attention 
by running themselves. 

"Shall I speak to him?” Vineta 
proposed. "He’s not likely to be 
afraid of a girl.” 

Tiorin hesitated. "That might be 
the answer. Spartak, what do you 
think?” 

"No use trying to talk to Spartak,” 
Vix grunted. "He’s off moaning 
again.” 

Tiorin looked dismayed. "Yes, 
Vineta, see if you can catch him up 
and get him talking. Eunora was 
quite sure he was not a Bucyon 
man, isn’t that right?” 

The mutant girl’s eyes were on 
Spartak. She started. "What — 7 Oh 

THE AITAR AT ASCOKEL 



yes. Yes, he’s not one of these mis- 
erable dupes, like all the others.” 

"Go ahead,” Tiorin ordered, and 
Vineta hurried off, leaving them to 
stroll like any of the other idlers 
along the quay. 

"It’s horrible,” Vix muttered. 
"Everything’s stopped! Even during 
the worst of the revolution here, we 
kept the main streets running, and 
the bridge yonder.” He threw up an 
angry arm. "It’s all going back to 
the mud now! What’s become of 
the engineers we had, the builders, 
the craftsmen?” 

"Right now Fm more worried 
about Spartak,” Tiorin muttered. 
"Eunora, can you tell us what’s hap- 
pened to him? I agree, the — the 
mental show, or whatever it was, that 
we had at the temple was pretty 
impressive, but I was on guard 
against tampering with my mind, 
and it’s mainly left me with the 
feeling I’d like to know how it’s 
done.” 

"Not so impressive,” Vix put in. 
"To people who haven’t flown space 
much, perhaps. Especially to people 
who thought the Empire was all pure 
magnificence and got some of their 
illusions dented. But we’ve seen what 
it’s like nowadays, and made up our 
minds that’s not the best mankind 
can do.” 

"If they spread the cult of Beli- 
zuek any further, it’s apt to be the 
only thing we ever did,” Tiorin 
said sourly. "Look, Vineta’s beck- 
oning. Spartak hurry up, will you, 
instead of dawdling along like a 
dreamer?” 

Tiorin kept one eye on Eunora 
as they approached Vineta and the 

101 




man Vix recognized, but she gave 
no indication of altering her judg- 
ment. ft was with some confidence 
tiiat he addressed the allegedly loyal 
citizen. 

‘‘Your name is Tharl, I under- 
ftand. You won’t know us, but 1 
assure you you’ll be very interested 
in what you hear from us.” 

Tharl, a nervous man of early 
middle age, clad in old but carefully 
patched clothes and with a pinched 
expression on his face, looked from 
one to other of the people who 
had been following him. He said at 
length, “1 took you for a party of 
Bucyon’s men set on my heels by 
the priests- But I should have known 
better, seeing the child with vou. 
Well, what do you want with me?” 
“We’ve returned to Asconel from 
travelling ten years long,” Tiorin 
aaid. “And — we’re horrified.” 

Tharl let a quick smile come and 
fo on his lips. “Say no more! I can 
provide you little hospitality — my 
wife and my son both offered them- 
adves to Belizuek, and my two 
daughters are married and living 
away. But I have a home still, and 
aome refreshment. Come and join 
mo there!” 

“Luck’s with us,” Vix muttered, 
mid they fell in behind Tharl to 
cross the bridge over the river. As 
ibey had foreseen, the bridge’s heat- 
ed and moving surface was im- 
mobile beneath a covering of soiled 
anow, so they had to walk all the 
way. 

T harl’s house was less neglected 
than those which flanked it; 
Aose had snow on their roofs,

whereas his was warm enough to 
melt it away, and the doors and win- 
dows still drew power instead of 
being converted to manual opera- 
tion. But all he could offer by way 
of “refreshment” was stale beer, 
bread and cheese. 

“Ten years!” he murmured as he 
set out the food and drink. “Why, 
then I’d have offered you meat and 
fruit even in dead winter. Do you 
know that now they kill their herds 
in the fall, salting the meat in sea- 
brine and keeping only enough stock 
to breed again in spring? The priests 
taught them that! I was raised on a 
farm, and to me it makes no sense.” 

“You — ah — ah you said your 
wife and son both offered them- 
selves to Belizuek,” Tiorin ventured. 
“Since then you live on your own.” 

“That’s what saved me from be- 
coming like all these fools you saw 
at the temple.” Tharl’s brows drew 
together over his nose and he stared 
into the distance. “I learned to hate 
just in time. Those who didn’t have 
been duped and betrayed. And ul- 
timately they won’t be human any 
more.” 

He peered curiously at Tiorin; 
apparently his eyesight was failing. 
“Tell me, though, how did you 
know it was safe to address me? 
If I make myself so obvious the 
priests will catch me — it’s a crime 
even to think, let alone speak, against 
Bucyon’s rule.” Alarm colored his 
words. 

Tiorin hesitated, making a warn- 
ing gesture to Vix who might have 
blurted out their true identity. “Ah 
— we took a chance. My friend here 
remembers meeting you during the 

IF

campaign against the rebels here- 
about in the time of the old War- 
den, Hodat’s father. You were loyal 
then. We fell a man like yourself 
couldn’t have changed so much.” 
Thar] pursed his lips. He com- 
mented, “You can’t have been home 
long. Anyone can be changed and 
made into a follower of Bucyon. 
Why, men 1 fought beside in the 
old days, Warden’s men as they 
were, have offered themselves to 
Belizuek since!” 

“Does nothing withstand Bucyon, 
then?” Vix dema'^ded. 

I t was Tharl’s turn for hesitation. 

coming to a favorable decision, 
he leaned forward and spoke in a 
confidential tone. 

“A movement — well . Put it 
like this. Over two or three years, 
I’ve sounded out those who have a 
reason to hate Belizuek as I do. 
Perhaps ten or twelve have proved 
loyal to the old ways. Of them half 
have given themselves away, by at- 
tacking a priest or profaning ihe 
temple — and the rest of us serve to 
encourage each other. As for rising 
up against Bucyon, though — it can’t 
be done.” 

pointed at Spartak. “Why, 
even your friend here has been so 
deeply affected by what happens in 
the temple that his mind’s adrift in 
space! First it was a wonder, and 
the curious talked about it and at- 
tracted the reluctant; then suddenly 
it became the only thing that mat- 
tered in the lives of the citizens. I 
escaped, as I said, because I already 
had a reason for hate. My wife and 
boy were the first of all to offer 



themselves in Penwyr. But that 
apart. I’d have become as bemused 
as he is.” 

Worried, Tiorin nudged Spartak 
as he sat with pale face and staring 
eyes on the chair next to him. 

“Tharl is wrong,” Eunora said 
timidly. “What’s affected him ^sn’t 
the power of Belizuek, but some- 
thing else.” 

“What?” Vix snorted, ready to 
fall back into his long-time assess- 
ment of Spartak as a* dreamer and a 
ninny. 

“Let him tell you himself,” Eu- 
nora said, and tugged at Spartak’s 
sleeve. 

“Yes?” the bearded man said, 
coming to the present like a sleeper 
rousing. “I — I’m sorry. I’ve been 
thinking over what I learned down 
there at the temple.” 

“That’s what we all want to dis- 
cuss,” Tiorin said. “We know what’s 
being done to the people now. If we 
can discover how it’s being done we 
can try to counteract it.” 

“You’ve missed the point,” Spar- 
tak said. “Don’t you know what 
Belizuek is?** 

There was a blank silence. Eu- 
nora smiled to herself as though 
enjoying the secret knowledge she 
could pick from Spartak’s unspoken 
thoughts. 

“Well, go on!” Vix burst out. 

Spartak shook his head. He seem- 
ed bewildered. “Then — well, pos- 
sibly I’m mistaken.” He shivered, as 
if he were still out in the street 
instead of in the comparative warmth 
of Tharl’s home. 

“I must go back and make sure," 
he added, rising without waiting for 



104 



IF 




ot^tions and starting for the door. 

*^Just a second I” Tharl jumped up 
and strode to stand in front of him. 
•*Back to the temple? What for?” 
“I shall have to get a direct look 
at Belizuek,” Spartak explained with 
the sweet reasonableness of one ad- 
dressing a child. 

“A direct look — ” Tharl was 
thunderstruck. “How do you pro- 
pose to manage that? Nobody has 
ever gone behind the screen they 
keep around him, except for sacrifi- 
cial victims and the priests who es- 
cort the poor fools. When the tem- 
ple was new, there were several who 
tried. They were killed by a deadly 
charge on the metal mesh.” 

“When the temple was new,” 
Spartak repeated, apparently stnidc 
by a new idea. “Tell me, how was 
it — well — consecrated?” 

T harl cxirled his lip. “That I know 
only too well. Some priests 
came from Gard in a skyboat — 
Card, the old royal island, is the 
site of the chief temple now. They 
brought some great chest or case 
affair which was unloaded with 
much ceremony. It was transported 
to the market — what’s now the 
temple — and they held the first big 
sacrifice, with two victims. My wife 
and my son.” 

Tiorin, seeing the man was almost 
overcome, moved to his side to com- 
fort him. He flashed a scowl at 
Spartak, who remained quite un- 
affected. Lost in his own thoughts, 
the other muttered, “It might be the 
oxygen ... If only I knew where 
we found the ships we appropriated! 
But there’s that blank wall of ig- 



norance supposed to be because it 
was bad for our self-respect to admit 
the real source of our skills — ” 

“You’re maundering,” Vix cut in. 
“If you have a point to make, make 
it!” 

“Shut up!” Spartak ordered. This 
was so different from the usual 
meekness of the younger man’s 
manner that Vix was taken aback; 
while he was recovering, Spartak 
rounded on Eunora. 

“Do you think I’m right?” he 
demanded. 

The girl blushed. She said, “I 
can tell you what I felt, if that’s 
any help. Welir ^le licked her lips. 
“I thought there was somebody be- 
hind the screen who went — uh — 
who went an awfully long way. Like 
very old, but also very big. Sort of 
connected to other pbices. Do you 
see what I mean?” 

Tharl’s puzzled eyes roamed 
around the strangers, but he said 
nothing. 

“It fits, doesn’t H7” Spartak urg- 
ed. 

“I don’t know,” Eunora answered 
helplessly. “You’ve studied so many 
things I never heard about. It would 
take ages to track down all the pos- 
sibilities you’re considering.” 

“Then we must go back to the 
temple,” Spartak concluded. “As 
soon as possible. Tharl, you must 
have been there at other times than 
the — the duty services. Presumably 
you’ve wanted to appear to be a 
loyal Bucyon man, to divert suspi- 
cion.” 

Tharl nodded dumbly. 

“Then tell me what the routine of 
the temple is, and how we can 



tHE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

get close to Belizuek without the 
priests driving us away.” 

XIX 

CCXT'ou can’t,” Tharl said short- 
I ly. 

“But wc must,” Spartak counter- 
ed, making a movement as if to 
brush aside all objections. Eunora, 
however, caught his eye. 

“He’s probably right,” she said. 
“Let him explain.” 

More puzzled than ever at the 
attention they paid to this slip of a 
girl, Tharl did so. Listening, Spartak 
came back by degrees to the realities 
of the problem. Ceaseless supervi- 
sion, eavesdropping by priests, traps 
for the unwary — it sounded as 
though the temple had been prepar- 
ed to meet just such an intrusion as 
he had planned. 

The solution, however, came from 
Vix. He gave a shrug. “How about 
remote detection devices? Won’t 
they do to settle your doubts? I have 
instruments aboard the ship which 
could be demounted temporarily 
You could probe the back wall of 
the temple and get some hint of 
what lies beyond.” 

“Of course,” Spartak muttered. 
“It must be the depressing effect of 
coming back to this ruined world, 
or I’d have thought of that myself. 
How long will it take us to get the 
equipment?” 

Vix frowned. “We’d best move 
under cover of dark,” he suggested. 
“It’ll be hard to conceal the gear 
by day.” 

“That’ll be still more difficult,” 
Tharl put in. “Th^e are strict cur- 



few laws now. Even street-lighting 
has been abandoned. Every drop of 
power and fuel is devoted to Beli- 
zuek’s cult.” 

“We’ll have advance warning of 
any patrols we run into,” Tiorin 
said, not offering to give details. “I 
wish you’d explain more fully, 
though,” he added, turning to Spar- 
tak. 

But the bearded man was engross- 
ed in some calculations conducted 
on a memo board from his beh- 
pouch. 

W ith infinite care and in com- 
plete silence they stole back 
towards the dead-seeming town in 
the pitch blackness and icy cold of 
the winter’s night. In the sky the 
stars burned like the points of white- 
hot needles. 

It had proved necessary to bring 
from the ship not only the instru- 
ments which Vix had mentioned, bat 
means of powering them too — ac- 
cumulators and a portable generator. 
When Tharl said all power went for 
Belizuek’s cult, he meant it. There 
would not be a power source for 
them to draw on for half a mile 
in any direction from the temple. 
Consequently they were all heavily 
laden, even Eunora, slipping and 
stumbling along gallantly at Spar- 
tak’s side. 

They reached the edge of the 
town and went between dark waHi 
which afforded little shelter from 
the wind. All the windows were Pot- 
tered, many with crude hand-car- 
pentered wooden panels instead of 
the original plastic power-operated 
ones. Through craclu gleamed m 



W 




occasional handlamp or even a pri- 
mitive candle. 

Once Eunora gave the faint whis- 
fle they had chosen as an riarm 
signal. They dodged into an alley 
between two houses as a woman 
emerged to empty some foul-smell- 
ing garbage into a street drain. 
There was no limit to the degree 
people could regress under Belizuek*s 
domination, Spartak told himself 
wearily. Next they’d be back to 
open-pk latrines and epidemics. 

He ached to find out whether his 
guess about the nature of this ‘^deity^ 
was accurate. 

They had settled on a street be- 
hind the temple as the best site of 
operations; it was usually unfre- 
quented at night, for this had form- 
erly been Penwyr’s busy commercial 
quarter. All the nearby stores were 
empty and neglected except oot 
which had been turned into a com- 
fortable residence for the temple 
staff. The curfew patrols, Thail 
assured them, were negligent in this 
area, for few people would risk 
going out under the priests* very 
noses. 

They reached it without trouble, 
and walked along the far side oppo- 
site the temple wall, on which the 
dogans glared huninous for the ben- 
efit of — of whom? Any priest who 
might glance out, Spartak decided 
with a curl of his lip. 

As nearly as he could tell, he had 
come to a point opposite the end 
of the screen inside the temple. He 
beckoned to his companions to as- 
semble the eqmpmeot. 

Metal stands dinked on the hard- 
frozen snow as they set down Ibeir 



burdens. He fumbled with numb 
fingers to make connections b et wee n 
#ie power supply and the detootom 
fiiemselves. 

Horin headed toward one end of 
the street, Vix md Vmeta towards 
the other, to keep wary watch. Eu- 
nora could do that equally well from 
where Spartak stood. Besides, her 
tiny hands were deft at the awkward 
work of organizing the equipment, 
and she did not have to be given 
wpcktn orders. 

It was the emiest task he had 
ever undertaken. EBs chief and burn- 
ing hope was that Belizuek’s powers 
did not extend to the percq>don of 
die various probe frequencies he 
planned to employ. 

H e coupled in the last deriee and 
silently handed die kmg fleoi 
attached to it to Eunora, who dariied 
across the street and clamped hs 
terminal to the wall of die temple. 

That automatically reported the 
structure-phase of the wall to the 
other instruments. So guided, they 
could look through it almost as 
easily as throu^ g^ass. Heart pound- 
ing, Spartak adjmted the controls 
and bent to peer at the tiny self- 
Suminated d^ and screens befem 
him. 

The range was excessive. He was 
getting a trace wWbh could only be 
dm nearer side of die ooncealinf 
screen — irregidar metal, probably 
in mesh or fink fewm. He turned a 
knob widi stfff fingers, and began 
lo get suggestkms of something less 
ecMnmonplace. 

A mass of oompkoL organics — 
not quite p ro l o pl a snric, but sfanflar. 



THI ALTAI AT ASOOML 




That fitted. He set another knob for 
the characteristic vibration modes 
of oxygen, and read off the data 
from a quivering needle against an 
arbitrary scale. 

Low oxygen pressure. Very low. 
But a good deal of carbon dioxide, 
and nitrogen and a blend of inert 
gases. Right! He began to look for 
the walls which must enclose this 
humanly unbreathable atmosphere, 
and almost at once found the traces 
which defined it. 

Beside him, Eunora was fascinat- 
ed by the vast amount of infor- 
mation the instruments afforded 
through a featureless wall; every 
new conclusion he drew brought a 
gasp of excitement from her. 

“It fits, doesn’t it?” he whispered, 
daring to make the sound which 
after all was no louder than the 
chinking and scraping that had ac- 
companied the setting up of their 
fear. 

She gave an enthusiastic nod. 

Yes, J^partak thought. Enclosed in 
m special atmosphere. Organic, but 
mot giving the same traces as a 
creature from one of our planets — 
« Thants bull, say, which would 
have competrable mass and dimen- 
sions. / wonder if I can get any 
of the iniemal structwe! 

Eimora*s fecit threitened to chat- 
ter from the cold; she clamped 
them firmly shut. 

Two traces came up on the panel 
— similar, but not identical. An in- 
ternal reflection, offering a clue to 
tec details he was after? He checked 
again, and started. No: it was the 
tame trace from two different points 
in space. 



In other words, the thing beyond 
the wall had moved. 

I am right! Jubilantly he recog- 
nized the final confirmation of his 
suspicions. Eunora could not re- 
press a chuckle as he hastily con- 
tinued his examination. 

And that was why she failed to 
give him warning. 

T he first he knew of their dis- 
covery was when lights bloomed 
like suns all down the front of the 
building, and a door opened to das- 
gorge about a dozen frantic men. 
Spartak jerked upright, heart seem- 
ing to stop its beating. 

The horrified Eunora let out a 
stifled cry of dismay. 

“There they are!” a voice yelled, 
and feet hammered the icy ground. 

The equipment would have to be 
abandoned — there was nothing ebe 
for it. Spartak snatched Eunora into 
his arms and fled towards the end 
of the street at which Vix and Vhi- 
eta had been standing guard. 

There was no sign of Tiorin. 
Handlamps had been brought out 
by the emerging priests, and their 
dazzling glare concealed the far end 
of the street. 

Nonetheless, he also must have 
been spotted. Two of the new arri- 
vals were dashing in that direction 
while the rest came on. 

“Spartak!” Vix hissed. He had 
drawn his concealed sidearm, and 
was hiding in an embrasure that had 
once been the entry to a store. “Go 
around the corner and turn left. 
rU give them something to think 
about and then we’ll make off to 
the right. Split them up!”

IF 




“Where’s Vineta?” Spartak gasp- 
ed. 

“Right here!*’ the girl replied from 
the shadow behind Vix. “I’m staying 
with Vix, so don’t argue!” 

Spartak hadn’t thought of arguing. 
He ignored the remark. “Vix, try 
and destroy the equipment! Maybe 
they won’t learn just how much I 
now know!” 

“You got what you wanted?” Vix 
was peering toward the brilliant 
lights, sighting along the barrel of 
his gun. 

“Practically everything!” 

At that instant a bolt seared along 
the street. Why it had been so long 
delayed, Spartak could only guess 
— presumably the priests hadn’t ex- 
pected to need weapons when they 
were alerted. Who had done the 
alerting was one of the many mat- 
ters to be left over for later. He 
ducked reflexively as splinters of 
stone flew from the spot where the 
bolt struck. 

“See you later at Tharl’sl” he 
whispered, and dived around the 
comer with Eunora. Behind him, 
Vix coldly took aim at the abandon- 
ed equipment, and fired his first bolt 
in reply to the priests’. 

This district was laid out in con- 
ventional grid pattern, so that when 
Spartak came to the next intersec- 
tion he could glance back and see 
clearly the end of the street near the 
temple. The light there was almost 
blinding by contrast with the general 
darkness, but he made out two fig- 
ures ducking away in the opposite 
direction from that which he had 
taken. 

Eunora had hidden her face 



against his chest, satisfied to per- 
ceive everything through his eyes. 

Vix had obviously kept his pro- 
mise to give the pursuers something 
to think about. It was long moments 
before anyone followed him and 
Vineta around the comer. The first 
person to do so was an armed man 
who fired one random shot; Vix let 
off another in reply, and provoked 
a scream, though whether it was of 
fear or pain Spartak could not tell. 
Then he ran on again, overtaking 
Vineta easily, and came to the inter- 
section corresponding to the one at 
which Spartak himself had paused. 

It was foolish, he told himself, not 
to make himself as scarce as time 
allowed, but somediing held him 
magnet-fashion; later, he decided it 
was a true premonition. 

Vineta stumbled on the icy street 
One of the pursuers loosed a bolt 
at her; it struck within arm’s length 
of her, and she went sprawling. Spar- 
tak gasped, and felt Eunora tense 
against him till she felt like a wood- 
en doll. 

From his inadequate cover Vix 
darted forward, gun in one hand, the 
other outstretched to seize Vineta 
and drag her to safety. He fired 
twice, so that the pursuers hdd 
back, and by main force got tlie 
girl on her feet, her arm around hia 
shoulder so she could use him as 
a crutch. 

It was a brave thing to do, a good 
thing to do, but so foolhardy Spar- 
tak winced. For with the weight of 
the injured girl delaying him, they 
caught him up at the end of the 
street and he went down under a 
mob of yelling priests. 



lor 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 




Sick at heart, but driven by cold 
logic to the decision that he could 
do nothing more practical than en- 
sure that he at least got away, 
whether or not Tiorin did so, he 
ducked around the corner and made 
his way unchallenged into dark and 
empty streets. It was so unfair that 
he should get away! Why not Vix, 
the brave fool? 

“What shall I do?” he whispered 
to the stars. “On my own, what 
shall I do?” 

And neither the stars nor the sob- 
bing Eunora offered an answer. 

XX 

F or the last half mile of their trip 
back to Tharl’s home Eunora 
stumbled along beside him. She no 
longer had difficulty keeping up 
with the man’s longer strides; he 
had brought himself to the verge of 
exhaustion. 

“Is Tiorin here ahead of us?” he 
demanded as they came in sight 
of their goal. 

She shook her head. “No one is 
there but Tharl, and he’s in a ter- 
rible state of anxiety. He’s wonder- 
ing all the time whether he was 
right to reveal himself to you.” 
“But he’s dependable?” Spartak 
insisted. 

“I’m not so sure as I was,” Eu- 
nora muttered. “Fear has been 
working on him ever since we left.” 
Spartak glanced at her, and for 
die first time in their headlong flight 
noticed that she was clutching some- 
diing to her with both hands. He 
didn’t have to ask what it was; he 
recognized it His medical case. 



which he had brought away from 
the ship and assumed to have been 
left on the street with the rest of 
the abandoned equipment. 

“I was holding the handle while 
you were working,” she explained 
shyly. “When you picked me up I 
clung to it.” 

“Well, it’s something. Go and tap 
on Tharl’s window. Get him to let 
us in.” 

It was painfully clear from Tharl’s 
face that fear had indeed been giv- 
ing him second thoughts since their 
departure. He hastened to shut the 
door and demanded why they were 
alone. 

Spartak told him with crude bre- 
vity. Tharl literally wrung his cal- 
loused hands. 

“Then you must make off at 
once! They’ll search the whole town, 
house by house. If they find you 
here it’ll be all up with me — and 
you as well. You say you have a 
ship? You must go back there at 
once. Leave Asconel for somewhere 
safe.” 

“I’m not leaving,” Spartak grunt- 
ed, dropping into a chair. “Not until 
Tiorin gets here.” 

“But if he’s been taken too — ” 

“If he’s been taken too, there’s 
no chance of my reaching our ship. 
They’ll pry the location of it out of 
my brothers’ minds.” 

“Your — your brothers?” echoed 
Tharl uncertainly. 

What point in keeping the secret 
any longer, if Bucyon’s men had 
both Vix and Vineta, and possibly 
Tiorin as well? He said wearily, 
“I’m Spartak, Hodat’s half-brother. 
The others were Vix and Tiorin.”

IF 




T harl’s eyes grew round with 
wonder. “Forgive me!” he bab- 
bled. “T didn’t know, I didn’t guess!” 
“You weren’t supposed to,” Spar- 
tak told him curtly. He leaned back, 
dosing his eyes. “Eunora, you can 
warn us of approaching search par- 
ties, can’t you?” 

“I was supposed to warn you of 
danger down at the temple,” the girl 
answered, eyes filling with tears 
again. “I failed. I’m — I’m terribly 
•orry, but I was so fascinated — ” 
“You’re forgiven,” Spartak inter- 
rupted. “Just don’t do it again.” 
“Excuse my asking,” Tharl ven- 
tured. “but how can she — ?” 

“Warn us? She’s a mutant.” 

"A mutant!” Millennia of Im- 
perial prejudice sprang up in Tharl’s 
nind, and he looked terrified. 

“Stop it,” Spartak ordered angri- 
ly. “She’s of human stock, and that’s 
more than you can say of Belizuek.” 
Curiosity and alarm struggled in 
Tharl’s mind; the former won, “Did 
you find out what he is?” he de- 
manded. 

“I think so. He’s a living creature, 
presumably capable of being killed. 
He requires to be housed in an air- 
light compartment in which the 
oxygen is far below our normal air. 
He’s Very large — and I suspect 
krger than any creature we’ve ever 
had to do with before. And he’s in- 
telligent. But he is also insane.” 
Tharl turned that over and finally 
rfiook his head. 

“What he is, in fact,” Spartak am- 
plified, “is the last survivor — m 
our galaxy at least — of the race 
from whom we inherited our star- 
•bips.” 



Tharl stiffened. Spartak snapped, 
“Don’t give me that Imperial propa- 
ganda that we built our own. I’ve 
studied ten years on Ann an world, 
and I’m satisfied that we went out 
from our original system — what- 
ever that was — and found a cache 
of starships left by a previous *ace. 
We converted them to our own use 
and spread through* the galaxy, find- 
ing more of them wherever we went, 
but no other trace of their builders. 
Not that it matters, really, except 
that it gives us a set of parameters 
to define Belizuek.” 

He ticked off points on his fin- 
gers. “Low oxygen. We have vague 
records to indicate that our prede- 
cessors were oxygen-breathers, as 
we are, but that they literally used 
up the resources of their own plan- 
ets and went elsewhere before they 
needed to colonize the ones we even- 
tually took over. Telepathic control 
of another species. This has been 
proposed as the ultimate in the do- 
mestication of animals. It fits. A 
view of the galaxy — and that’s per- 
haps the most important thing of 
all!” He jerked upright in his chair. 

“You’ve seen the picture of the 
galaxy which accompanies the 
‘proof’ during the temple services? 
Didn’t you notice that it’s an Argian 
map that it’s based on?” 

TTiarl could only mumble his an- 
swer. 

“I tell you it is. Because it shows 
the Big Dark. The Big Dark is a 
recent phenomenon; it’s anomalous, 
so it’s been carefully studied, and 
it’s only some ten to twelve thousand 
years old. And at its present size 
. well, I’m convinced that Beli-

zaek has only seen human repre 
sentations of the galaxy. That’s the 
clincher for me. 

“I said he was insane. Why else 
would he have been left behind 
when the rest of his species took 
off for — for wherever? Why else 
should he descend to this petty shift 
of domesticating human beings, to 
move him from star-system to star- 
system? I got it direct, down in the 
temple. Conceit! Illimitable megalo- 
maniac craving for power! And he 
couldn’t get it from his own species, 
because when he tried he was made 
an outcast and abandoned.” 

“He?” The word was almost a 
squeak from Tharl. 

4 4T know what you’re trying to 

X say,” Spartak nodded. “If 
there’s a living creature in every 
temple of Belizuek, why not speak 
of ‘they’? This is the final evidence 
I have for his insanity. 

“Equipped with the kind of 
knowledge and techniques which 
the Empire enjoyed at the height 
of its power, it was estimated that 
a man could breed his kind from 
his own germ-plasm, artificially, to 
repopulate an abandoned planet. I 
have no doubt that Belizuek could 
do the same if he wished. But he 
doesn’t wish. He’s afraid of com- 
petition. The .part of him which is 
in the Penwyr temple is a second 
self, not a bred descendant, an off- 
spring. Ten thousand years ago, 
before we spread through the gal- 
axy, it was open and empty before 
him! And it took him that long to 
make up his mind that could trust 
himself on one single other planet 



besides Brinze! 1 say he's insane.” 
“I see!” Eunora breathed. “That’s 
why 1 had the impression that he 
was so large in time and space!” 
“Exactly. A vast number of iden- 
tical selves. And he’s telepathic be- 
tween all of them.” 

“Then how does he communicate 
with us? We’re different!” 

“Do you think he eats the sac- 
rifices he’s given?” Spartak said 
with monumental disgust. “Never. 
He uses them as a biological ampli- 
fier till their brains are burned out, 
to provide a link between himself 
and his audience.” 

Tharl felt for a chair and lowered 
himself into it without looking. 
“And you worked all this out since 
you arrived? Within a day?” 

“I — ” Spartak checked. He star- 
ed at Eunora, who was giggling. 
“You?” he said incredulously. 
“Not really,” she countered. “It 
took your knowledge to solve the 
problem. But all day since we were 
in the temple I’ve been — asking 
questions of your subconscious.” 
Spartak felt sweat prickle on his 
forehead. “What you’re going to 
be like when you grow up, I don’t 
know! And if we’ve been deporting 
people like you to the rim ever 
since the foundation of the Enoh 
pire, what can be going on out 
there?” 

Still, that was irrelevant. He glar- 
ed at Tharl. “Well, now you know 
what became of your wife and son; 
now you know the nature of the 
beast we’re up against. What are you 
going to do — order me to leave 
here and hide like a criminal, ot 
help me further?” 



112 



IF 




don’t see what I can dol” Tharl 
•aid helplessly. your brothers 
have been captured, it’ll be known 
who they are, and — ” 

S partak cut him short. “Are you 
in touch with any centers of 
resistance on Gard Island? You said 
the original temple was there.” 
“Yes — yes, that’s right but . 
No, I know of no resistence move- 
ment there. It’s become Bucyon’s 
private preserve.” 

“You know the city itself, per- 
haps?” 

“Oh yes. When your brother Vix 
celebrated the completion of his 
campaign, he included me in the 
honor guard at the Warden’s pal- 
ace. 

“In that case, we should make for 
Gard,” Spartak said. “In any case. 
We’ll try a direct attack on the 
original Belizuek that was brought 
to Asconel. A simple breach in the 
air-tight container should be 
enough.” 

“So simple?” Tharl breathed. 
“Why, if I’d known—” 

“You’d have gone to the temple 
yourself,” Spartak finished for him. 
He checked, struck by a sudden 
thought. 

“What means would you have 
used?” 

“I’ll show you,” Tharl said ea- 
gerly, and went into the next room. 
There were scraping sounds. 

“Under the floor,” Eunora whis- 
pered. “A secret cavity.” 

And Tharl was back, cradling 
proudly in his arms a shiny energy 
gun. “The same with which I served 
your father and brother, sir,” he 



announced. “And charged ready for 
use.” 

Spartak pursed his lips. “Here 
now is your chance to do a far 
greater service. Will you undertake 
it? 

Tharl looked extremely unhappy, 
but he didn’t say anything. 

“You must hide us here for at 
least a day, to give Tiorin a chance 
to rejoin us. This is the only meet- 
ing-place we have. During the day- 
time, however, you must go about 
as usual to avoid suspicion. While 
you’re out, ask what means we can 
employ to get to Oard. Anything. 
A boat, a skjrboat, ndiatev^ can 
sdll be hired. And as soon as pos- 
sible, we’ll go.” 

“We, sir?” Tharl ventured. 

“I understood your wife and your 
son — ” 

“And your brothers, sir.” Tharl 
placed the butt of the gun on the 
ground and leaned on it, gazing into 
nowhere. “I’m not a coward — but 
after such a long time, to have a 
plan of action ... It takes me 
aback.” 

Spartak refrained from pushing 
him any further. He yawned cavem- 
ously. “I must sleep,” he mutter- 
ed. “Though Tm not sure I can. 
Eunora — ” 

But she had already closed her 
eyes. 

XXI 

iiQomeone’s coming!” Eunora 

^ whispered. “Officials!” 

Spartak jolted out of uneasy slum- 
ber. The long winter night had not 
yet given way to dawn, but the 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



113 




first thing he saw when he opened 
his eyes was Tharl, up and dressed 
and carrying a tray of breakfast: 
hot broth and bread. His face was 
pale with alarm. 

“Searching for us?” Spartak rap- 
ped. 

Eunora, nuzzled, shook her head. 
“Apnarentlv not. There are four of 
them going from house to house. 
One’s a priest, I think. They aren’t 
searching the houses. Just knocking 
at the doors and telling the people 
that . .” 

“Telling them what?” Spartak 
urged. 

The girl bit her lip. “Tiorin and 
Vix were captured. There’s going 
to be a grand ceremony at the chief 
temple on Card. They’ll voluntarily 
give themselves up to Belizuek, and 
everyone who can is urged to go 
there and witness this final triumph 
of Bucyon.” 

Spartak sat rock-still for long mo- 
ments. “Do they not know about 
us?” 

“You’d think so, wouldn’t you?” 
Eunora knitted her brows. “I think 
I understand, though. They’re hop- 
ing you’ll make a false step and 
reveal yourself.” 

“That sounds like them, all right,” 
Tharl said sourly. 

“They’re coming closer,” Eunora 
warned. “Only three or four houses 
away. We’d better get out of sight.” 

Tensely, crouched in the conceal- 
ment of a closet, they strained their 
cars for auditory confirmation of 
what she had detected, and when he 
let them out again Tharl gave it 
fresh emphasis. 

“Just as the little girl says,” he 



muttered. “Everyone who possibly 
can is expected to travel to Gard 
and see your brothers sacrificed, 
sir. We’d best make haste, hadn’t 
we?” 

“Not too fast,” Spartak sighed. 
“Give them a chance to get over 
the hill. Then take this money and 
book us passage.” 

A s they approached the dockside 
towards sunset, shivering in the 
chill blasts of icy foam that the 
night wind whipped off the estuary, 
two priests stood beside the gangway 
to their skimmer, searching the 
faces of all those that passed. 

“Are they looking for us, Eu- 
nora?” Spartak whispered. 

“Luckily no,” she murmured in 
reply. “They’re turning away peo- 
ple notoriously lax in their temple 
attendance. This trip is supposed 
to be a reward for loyal homage. I 
don’t know what they’re doing about 
strangers. So few people travel now- 
adays they hadn’t considered the 
problem.” 

Tharl drew a deep breath. “Leave 
this to me, sir,” he suggested, and 
as they drew near the priests pushed 
his way forward. 

“Forgive me, sirs!” he shouted, 
and their heads turned. “Perhaps 
you’ll remember, sirs, that when 
Belizuek first came to honor Penwyr 
with his presence my wife and my 
son were the very first to give him 
their total service. And I was bit- 
ter!” He shook his head in a parody 
of regret. “I know now it was fool- 
ish of me. Why, if the Warden’s 
brothers themselves have returned 
and agreed to offer themselves up 



114 



IF 




lo Bdizuek, what more powerful 
proof could anyone want that he is 
indeed the master of us all and truly 
superior?” 

“Clever!” Spartak whispered. “Is 
it going to work?” 

“Oh, yes,” Eunora said with a 
twisted smile. “They’re lapping it 
up. He’d only better be careful he 
doesn’t overdo it — one of them is 
thinking of singling him out for 
special temple duty.” 

If they had been aware that the 
long bundle of clothing and provi- 
sions slung over Tharl’s shoulder 
contained the energy gun he had 
produced last night, they would 
have been a deal less eager. But 
Belizuek was far away from the 
docks, and these were only human 
dupes. 

Tharl came to rejoin them when 
they were securely aboard, wiping 
sweat from his face, and blushing 
faintly at Spartak’s compliments. 

“Too early for that, sir,” he coun- 
tered. “We haven’t even cast off 
yet.” 

In one way at least he was right. 
That voyage was among the most 
dreadful experiences of Spartak’s 
entire life. To be with these three 
or four hundred , people who laugh- 
ed and sang ribald songs while they 
passed canteens of precious wines 
and the typical Penwyr sour beer 
as they might on any festival ex- 
cursion — then, to remember with 
a jolt the excuse for such jollifica- 
tion: the planned sacrifice of his 
brothers, including Vix, whom many 
of these people had served in the 
old days, whom they had cheered 
as the son of the late Warden and 

THE ALTAR AT ASCONa 



brother of Hodat the heir-apparent 
. that was like living a night- 
mare. And all the time Eunora was 
alert for some keen-eyed person to 
pierce his disguise. 

The chances of his being betray- 
ed receded somewhat when the 
word got about that he was a doc- 
tor, and a mother whose child was 
sensitive to seasickness came begging 
his help. The little boy recovered at 
once when Spartak tended him, and 
after that a shy succession of pa- 
tients surrounded him, asking help 
and advice for an incredible range 
of complaints. 

Spartak’s fury burned inside him 
like a coal. When he left Asconel 
for Annanworld, there had been no 
one hungry, no one very sick, and 
certainly no one suffering from the 
deficiency diseases. Yet time and 
again when he examined those who 
now presented themselves, he saw 
that their need was not for drugs, 
but for soap and water and a proper 
diet. 

Weeping sores. Ulcers. Gumi 
sickly sweet with pus. ChildreiA 
bones twisted into awkward curves. 
Eyes matted with a dirty yellow dis- 
charge. So the tale went on. More 
than once, as he was on the point 
of bursting out at some silly fool 
about the true reason for his con- 
dition, Eunora caught his eye and 
gave an almost imperceptible head- 
shake, implying, “Don’t! He’ll go 
to the priest at once.” 

The priest — there was one aboard 
any passenger vessel on Asconel 
nowadays — came to Spartak in the 
end; that encounter was hardly to 
be avoided. He put a mimber of 

IIS 




curious questions which Spartak 
deftly dodged, trying to give the im- 
pression that the priest was making 
himself look ignorant by not know- 
ing the answers already. 

In the end the trick worked and 
the priest made off, embarrassed 
without being sure why. 

I t was established beyond a doubt 
that half the people who had set 
off from northern islands Hke Pen- 
wyr would never get to Card in 
time, when they started to raise the 
traffic from the nearer ports the 
next day. The sea seemed to be 
crawling with passenger vessels. 
There were even skyboats overhead, 
the first Spartak had seen since his 
return. All were converging on Gard 
for the ceremony. Winter was be- 
hind them at this latitude; the sky 
was blue and the sun mild and 
warm. 

The tremendous strain the influx 
of pilgrims put on the resources of 
Gard city worked in their favor. 
With boats crowding into the port 
and disembarkation reduced to a 
panicky rush down the gangplanks 
so that room could be made for the 
next vessel, the guards and priests 
who supervised the travellers could 
not hope to keep control. 

Moreover, here was no poverty- 
stricken provincial town. Bucyon 
dearly liked his luxuries as much as 
anyone. And everything worked, to 
the wonder of the stranger children. 
Food was abundant, on quayside 
stalls and in the city’s stores; gaudy 
posters, banners and streamers dec- 
orated the buildings for the great 
day tomorrow, and relic hawkers of- 

iu 



fered — when there were no priests 
in sight — such precious items as 
hairs from Bucyon’s beard and 
Lydis’s nail-clippings. 

Spartak, taken in at first by this 
deception, was half-minded to buy 
one of the relics and put it under 
the microscope to see if Lydis’s al- 
leged mind-reading powers were duo 
to a cellular mutation; then he rea- 
lized these were frauds to trap the 
credulous. 

His heart ached as he beheld his 
former home. His knuckles whiten- 
ed on the handle of the medical case 
he carried, now much depleted after 
the voyage. 

‘Tf I could only get next to Bucy- 
on!” he whispered. 

“Not a chance,” Tharl muttered, 
glancing around to make sure they 
were not overheard as they trudged, 
with thousands of others, toward the 
center of the city. Ahead, the streets 
were in full operation, and there 
were delighted squeals from the 
youngest children who had never 
seen a molecular-flow street before. 
“He’s always guarded very strictly. 
And Lydis, who can read thoughts, 
never leaves his side.” 

“Where is the temple?” Spartak 
demanded. 

“It used to be the Place of Grand 
Assembly,” Tharl told him. 

Spartak came to a decision, ar- 
ranged a meeting-place with Tharl 
for later, and sent him off to find 
them a place to stay. Then he and 
Eunora went straight to the temple. 

It had not been altered much to 
accommodate its change of func- 
tion. Behind it loomed the dark 
riiape of the Warden’s palace, now 

IF 
















m 









Bucyon’s home. The War Jen’s I'hair 
had been moved forward lo mL-ke 
room for a huge gilded dome In 
fide there dwelt Belizuek; the orig- 
inal self of which all the local Beli- 
zuek's were only reflections, in 
Spartak’s view. 

The sire of the dome took him 
aback. Either this Belizuek was a 
monster, or there were several lay- 
ers of armour around him, in which 
case would even an energy gun . .? 

He checked himself. Before mak- 
ing any plans, he needed to get de- 
tails ot the planned ceremony. 
There was a gang of men at work 
assembling a high dais close to the 
Warden’s chair; it only required a 
few friendly words and the flash of 
a five-circle coin to get the full 
program 

This dais was to be the place 
where Vix and Tiorin were display- 
ed to anv in the crowd who might 
doubt their identity. From it they 
would ^tate their intention of enter- 
ing voluntarily into the '‘full service” 
of Belizuek. Bucyon and Lydis 
would be present; they would leave 
the palace in ceremonial procession 
at such a time, reach the temple at 
•uch another time, begin the ritual 
at such another time . 

Spartak seized on the crucial 
point that they would leave their 
groundcar at the far end of the 
horseshoe-shaped temple. He tipped 
their informant and returned thither. 
There were many idle sightseers 
around, so they attracted no special 
attention. 

“1 have it!” he whispered, and 
mapped his fingers. He shot a glance 
at Eunora. “Will it work?” 



“1 — I don’t know.” She was very 
pale. “Can you get Tharl to the 
right place with his gun?” 

“I’m sure I can. I was raised in 
the Warden’s palace, remember, and 
that dominates the far end ol the 
Assembly But am I asking too 
much of you?” 

“I don’t think so,” Eunora mur- 
mured. “Until I meet Lydis face to 
face I can’t be sure. Bui I had a 
lot of practice in dissembling back 
home. 1 think even to a mind-read- 
er I may be able to tell a lie.” 

XXII 

T he great day, when the last 
traces of the old order would 
be wiped away forever as the late 
Warden’s brothers acknowledged the 
dominion of Belizuek and entered 
freely into his full service, dawned 
mild and sunny, and grew rapidly 
hot. 

Long before the scheduled time 
of the ceremony people were throng- 
ing into the streets. Those fortunate 
enough to view it in person cram- 
med the horseshoe seating of the 
Place of Grand Assembly, where 
music and songs in honor of Beli- 
zuek whiled the time away, and the 
ordinary populace put on what they 
had left in the way of presentable 
clothing and made do with the pub- 
lic watch-screens and amateur tum- 
blers fooling around in the gutters 
The dais was completed. Cover- 
ed in gaudy banners, it stood wait- 
ing for the victims. 

Punctually on schedule, Bucyon 
— gorgeous in ceremonial ar.mour 
that shone chrome-bright and daz- 



11B 



IF 




zling — entered his groundcar. Be- 
side him, pale, very beautiful and 
dressed as always in a floor-long 
black gown, sat Lydis. The people 
disciplined their minds into adoring 
patterns, fearing the rumored talent 
which had brought her to her pres- 
ent eminance. 

Everywhere the. procession pass- 
ed there were yells of delight and 
applause, and chanting in honor of 
Belizuek, and of Bucyon who had 
blessed Asconel by bringing him 
here. Occasionally a visitor from 
elsewhere on the planet, who re- 
membered the old days well enough 
to have kindled a spark of envy at 
the continuing luxury of Gard con- 
trasted with the poverty at home, 
shouted less fervently than the rest 
But soon the pressure of anxiety lest 
he be discovered drove him to out- 
bellow his neighbors. 

It was a spectacle to dim the most 
vivid memory of the old days, any- 
how: the guards, the priests in their 
most brilliant robes, and at the cen- 
ter the lovely Lydis and the hand- 
some Bucyon, acknowledging the 
love of their subjects with an occas- 
ional gracious wave. 

And were not the last hangers-on 
of the old order due to renounce 
their pretensions today? 

C ertain unscheduled events also 
took place. 

Not long after the dignitaries be- 
gan to fin their seats in Ae Assem- 
bly, a fat man in a front rank clap- 
ped his hand to his nape and looked 
to see if he had killed a stinging 
insect. 

There was nothing on his palm. 
THE ALTAR AT ASCONa 



Another minute or so, and he be- 
gan to complain loudly to his neigh- 
bors that it was terribly hot. Sweat 
ran from his face. He fought for 
breath, loosening the neckband of 
his coat, and swore at the sun for 
beating down so fiercely. It was not 
long before he closed his eyes and 
began to breathe in enormous gasps. 
Alarmed, those around him sought 
help, and were relieved at the ap- 
proach of a fair-bearded man who 
identified himself as a doctor. 

Instructions were crisply issued to 
carry the fat man to shade, rest him 
and let him recover his spirits. That 
attended to, the fair-bearded man 
fell talking with those who had ap- 
pealed for his aid. 

It was entirely natural that as the 
arrival of Bucyon was signaled he 
should slip into the place the fat 
man had left vacant. 

It had not all gone so smoothly. 
As he tensed to see Bucyon enter 
the vast stadium-like temple Spar- 
tak was vaguely surprised to think 
that he was here exactly as ar- 
ranged. Yesterday afternoon, when 
he found that Tharl had been over- 
anxious to please, and provided 
them with accommodation in a 
place he felt fit for a Warden’s son, 
there had been a lot of trouble. Ul- 
timately they had had to settle for 
Ae rooms after all — Gard was 
packed to overflowing with the pil- 
grims from overseas. 

To the Big Dark with fears of 
appearing conspicuous, anyway. The 
^ort conversation he had had with 
those around him here had satisfied 
Inm that Bucyon did not rule wholly 
by the power of Belizuek. Here 

lie 




gathered were men and women who 
were conscious traitors; they would 
never be called on for the full ser- 
vice of Belizjek! They were Bucy- 
on’s willing accomplices in the busi- 
ness of raping Asconel. 

It was only to be expected. Bu- 
Cyon’s own forces — even if along 
\^ith the priests you counted in the 
crews from a respectably sized space- 
fleet — wouldn’t suffice to adminis- 
ter a population of nine hundred 
million, no matter how pliant 
But the proof of his suspicion 
made him feel sick. 

At least they h' !n’t suspected him 
in their turn. He was acknowledged 
as a fit companion, a tribute to the 
glibness of his tongue and his court- 
ly manners. Almost it seemed it was 
easier to conduct nefarious business 
in broad daylight than under the 
cover of night. The trouble they 
had had sneaking Tharl into the 
Warden’s palace. With Eunora 
keeping watch for patrols so that 
they could dodge into shadow every 
time, they had still spent better than 
four hours getting ITiarl inside. 

Spartak’s eyes strayed toward the 
palace. Was the man safe where he 
was supposed to be? 

T harl twisted himself into a mar- 
ginally more comfortable posi- 
tion. The hot, clammy air from the 
discharge pipe of the air circulators 
coated his skin with dirty moisture. 
But he had gloves, and his hands 
would not slip on the switches of 
his gun. Lovingly he sighted it for 
the hundredth time on the distant 
golden dome shielding the alien 
monster Belizuek. 



He felt himself a changed person 
since the moment he met Spartak 
and his brothers. He had been giv- 
en back his sense of purpose in life. 
He had been offered a chance to 
avenge the slaughter of his wife and 
son. 

He lowered the gun to a resting 
position and gave a sigh of content- 
ment. Nothing else mattered. He 
was still bruised from a fall he had 
taken trying to get up the interior 
of this ventilation pipe,, still anxiout 
about the noise he’d made which 
might have alarmed a guard — but 
apparently had not — and both hun- 
gry and tired into the bargain. To 
the Big Dark with such complaintsi 
He had the important thing: a job 
to do. 

Once more he lifted the gun and 
peered through its telescope. IBs 
heart quickened. Spartak was in 
position among the dignitaries cm 
the steeply banked seating. It 
couldn’t be much longer now. 

If only the litde girl played her 
part — I 

T he next in the sequence of un- 
scheduled events didn’t come 
until Bucyon and Lydis were getting 
down from their groundcar. The 
archpriest Shry — a curiously hor- 
rible figure, his back enormously 
bulging with some soft outgrowtii 
of tissue — came to greet them. 
Bands played. The watchers cheer- 
ed. 

Under the arms of the guards 
who held back the crowd, a little 
girl slipped like an eel, clutching a 
bunch of flowers. A cry of alarm 
went up. 



120 



ir 




Guards leveled their guns. Then 
they hesitated, seeing how tiny she 
was, how well-scrubbed and attrac- 
tive in her too-small, faded frock, 
and how innocuous the posy that she 
now shyly offered to Bucyon. 

The tryant scowled for a second, 
wondering who had arranged this 
‘‘spontaneous” gesture of affection 
and why he had not been warned. 
He glanced at Lydis, who was frown- 
ing. But when after some seconds 
she did not tell him to desist, he 
put on a smile and accepted the 
flowers, afterward patting the girl’s 
head. 

She was by now almost overcome 
by the strain of her great moment, 
and when Bucyon had gone on she 
slipped out of sight. Under one of 
the temporary stands wccted to 
watch the procession she keeled 
over and slept for more than half 
an hour. 

The posy had contained the last 
of Spartak’s precious supply of the 
drug with which he had restored 
her to sanity. Handing it to Bucyon, 
she had triggered an injector that 
shot the entire dose into the fleshy 
ball of his thumb. 

And all the time she had slid 
away from the probing of Lydis and 
Shry. To resist them, to lie and de- 
ceive them for about ninety seconds, 
had cost her every ounce of her 
energy, so that when she fell down 
in a faint she knew neither where 
she was nor whether she would 
ever wake up. 

S partak felt a lurching sensation 
of relief. Bucyon was coming 
op the main aisle of the Assembly 



heading the posy he had given to 
Eunora. Provided the injector hadn’t 
misfired, he was going to be ex- 
tremely tractable . 

And that, presumably, was Shry. 
Spartak shivered as he studied the 
gross misshapen form of the arch- 
priest. Yet Lydis found nothing dis- 
tasteful in him; she accepted his 
arm as he helped her to her chair 
to one side of and behind the War- 
den’s — which Bucyon sank into. 
Fanfares made the very sky re- 
sound, and were themselves drown- 
ed by the bellows of applause that 
issued from the crowd. 

Then they brought Vix and Tior- 
fai down the aisle. 

Silence fell, for which Spartak 
was eternally grateful. He ached to 
see his brothers treated thus. Their 
disguises had been stripped, their 
hair restored to its original flaming 
red and they were clad in plain 
white suits, with their feet bare in 
an age-old penitential gesture. 

And there was apparently no 
sham about Bucyon’s claim that they 
were to sacrifice themselves volun- 
tarily. They were neither bound nor 
very closely guarded. And as they 
came down the long aisle they held 
their heads high and walked like 
heroes. 

The horrifying idea struck him 
that if they spotted him they would 
feel it an honor to give him away. 
He cursed not having found time to 
change his appearance once again, 
and made what shift he could to 
hide his face behind a raised hand. 

But they passed on, to take their 
places on the altar-like dais. All 
was in readiness. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL

The only explanation he could 
think of for their obvious willing- 
ness to come to their own funeral 
was that Belizuek’s emanations were 
already in control of their minds. 
And indeed, now he turned his at- 
tention to it, Spartak thought he 
could feel the same awe-inspiring 
presence which had impressed the 
Penwyr congregation. 

For a moment, indeed, it tempted 
him to yield, seeming to say, “Fooll 
Even if Belizuek is in truth a living 
creature, is he not the last of a line 
greater than the human race — those 
squabbling borrowers of another’s 
power?” 

And further: “What can I do 
to thwart the destiny of this whole 
planet? I, one man, with a feeble 
plan that depends on a dozen out- 
rageous coincidences to succeed!” 

He hoped Tharl was going to be 
on time. 

P eople had recognized Vix and 
Tiorin, and their faces reflected 
their complete conviction about Bu- 
cyon’s claims. He really did have 
them here; they really were about 
to enter Belizuek’s service. Some, 
especially those near Spartak, had 
harbored doubts till this very last 
moment. Now they were mentally 
congratulating themselves on having 
thrown in their lot with the winning 
party. 

Shry stepped to the front of the 
dais and began to address the crowd 
in a whining bleat of a voice, de- 
scribing the event they all knew 
ftty were about to witness. But no 
one complained; behind the words 
there slowly grew die sense of Beli- 

IM 



zuek’s presence, the aura of a mao- 
ter of galaxies, the sense of being im 
a supernatural creature’s power. 

Spartak sweated and fidgeted. Ho 
had told Tharl to fire arbitrariljr 
five minutes after the commence- 
ment of the ceremony. Never had 
five minutes been so long! Already 
the waves of mental control were 
battering his deafness; most of the 
crowd had succumbed willingly and 
instantly. 

Something must have gone wrong. 

Tharl must have been discovered. 

The plan was a failure. Asconel 
was doomed and he with it. 

Shry reached the climax of his 
introduction, turned his twisted body 
and threw up an arm in a dramatic 
gesture towards Tiorin and \^x — 

And with impeccable dieatrical 
timing, Tharl loosed the first of hii 
energy bolts against the golden 
dome enclosing BelizueL 

xxm 

T he second bolt followed, then 
the third, fourth and fifth, with 
the impersonal regularity of a 
clock’s ticking. And on the fifth the 
golden dome was broached. 

A noise like a scream was heard, 
half with the ears, half with the 
mind, and a foul stink oozed oat 
over the crowd. It reminded Spar- 
tak of the stench from mud exposed 
by an exceptionally low tide at the 
mouth of a river much used for 
the disposal of sewage. 

Paralysis overtook everyone pres- 
ent for the space of long seconds — 
except himself. 

The first shot had bras|}it hna 

IF 




to his feet. Before the last had 
struck, he had fought his way down 
the nearest transverse aisle and was 
clambering over the barrier separat- 
ing the seats from the longitudinal 
aisle up which his brothers had so 
lately been marched on show. 

His head was ringing with both 
sound and soundless cries: the yells 
of dismay that had now broken out 
among the crowd, the incoherent 
jabbering of orders to the guards, 
somefthing being shrieked in a high 
panicky vcMce by the woman Lydis. 
All these were commonplace reac- 
tions to what had happened. But 
ovwiying them, permeating the very 
air, was a sudden terrible sense of 
doom, the emanation from Beli- 
zuek’s mind as his body was ex- 
posed to the oxygen-rich air of this 
planet preferred by men. 

Spartak thought of the tens of 
millennia through which Belizuek’s 
^ecies had used up the atmospheres 
of their old worl^, adapting little 
by little, growing used with every 
passing generation to a higher con- 
centration of carbon dioxide, a low- 
er percentage of available oxygen, 
nndl the contact of this rawer air 
was like acid poured on naked flesh. 

But that didn’t matter right now. 
For tiie present he had the advan- 
tage of knowing what had happened. 
It was a slender weapon to offer 
against Bucyon’s armor, but be had 
to make the most of it. 

He glanced at Vix and Tiorin. 
They were standing bewildered, 
blinking at each other and the fa- 
fiuliar Place ot Grand Assembly, 
like men newly woken from a bi^ 
dream. But it would take B^aeiik 



a while to die, and until he did die, 
the invisible talons would remain 
fast on their minds. 

Now — actioni 

Spartak drew himself up to his 
full height and confronted the man 
who till this morning had been only 
a name to him — Bucyon, who. had 
come from space to rape and rum 
a beautiful world in the name ol an 
obscene monster. And who now. If 
he was .human, must be open for 
mastery by the first who seized con- 
trol of him. 

‘‘Bucyon!” Spartak bellowed, 
hands cupped around his mouth. 
The name seemed to plough through 
the oppressive mental aura like an 
energy bolt, leaving a visible track 
of white steam. “Bucyon, speak to 
your people!^* 

Spartak had spent long on his 
choice of phrase. That was his ulti- 
mate selection: a command both 
innocuous and deadly. 

Shry had gone wailing to see what 
harm was done to the golden dome. 
Half out of sight of Spartak, he was 
waving his arms frantically, trying 
to make guards and other priests 
come to him and help repair the 
damage. But the woman Lydis — 
doubtless aware of the drug now 
coursing through Bucyon’s body — 
had jerked to her feet and now 
stood rockstill, her eyes burning 
Spartak. 

The call he had uttered took ef- 
fect. Hoping for some guidance 
from Belizuek’s human deputy, the 
crowd quieted, the guards tensed 
for anticipated orders, the priests 
hesitated as they made to obey 
Shry’s beckoniag signals. 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



123 




“Speak to your people, the peo- 
ple of Asconel!” Spartak shouted 
again. “Tell them — what is Beli~ 
zuekr 

But he was watching Lydis, not 
Bucyon, and was prepared when 
she gasped and tried to clutch at the 
big man’s arm, wanting to prevent 
the betrayal which he could not help 
because the drug compelled him to 
total honesty. 

Spartak jumped forward, hurling 
himself at the overhang of the dais 
and rolling onto its boards like a 
high-jumper clearing a difficult 
mark. As he moved, he was still 
calling: “Bucyon, Bucyon, tell them, 
tell them — the people of Asconel 
want to hear from you! Tell them 
about Belizuek!** 

On the last breathless yell he was 
at Bucyon’s side, and his shoulder 
slammed against Lydis’s, heedless of 
her sex. Fragile as a foamed dum- 
my, she staggered back and fell 
against the chair from which she 
had risen, and remained dazed for 
a few precious moments during 
which Spartak alone had Bucyon’s 
ear. 

The drug took over his will, and 
he spoke helplessly to the attentive 
audience. 

“Belizuek is die last survivor of 
the species that ruled the galaxy 
before man.” 

T he oppressive aura of hate and 
desperation redoubled its inten- 
as if a storm cloud had settled 
over the AssemWy. Spartak risked 
a glance behind him, fearing that 
Ary might have contrived to ef- 
fect repairs. 



“He’s a material creature, isn’t 
he?” he shouted. “Not a mystical 
spirit! Not a supernatural being! 
But a creature that had to feed and 
breathe as we do!” 

“Yes!” Bucyon agreed, helpless to 
deny it. 

“And that can be killed as we 
can!” 

“Yes!” 

Already the impact of this revela- 
tion was having its effect among the 
crowd. Those who had befieved 
otherwise were pale with dismay; 
the conscious traitors who had nev- 
er been duped were yet paler, for 
some of them thought they recog- 
nized a familiar countenance behind 
the new beard on Spartak’s face, de- 
spite the dyeing of his hair. 

“Why is he still with us, when 
the rest of his kind have gone? Tell 
them that!” 

“They cast him out,” Bucyon an- 
swered. “They exiled him to the 
world called Brinze, where men 
found him.” 

“Why?” 

“They said it was because he was 
insane!” Spittle was gathering on 
the corners of Bucyon’s mouth and 
running down into his beard. His 
eyes were rimmed white as he strove 
and failed to stop his tongue from 
speaking. 

“Ah, and he was supposed to be 
immortal, wasn’t he?” Spartak thun- 
dered. “And he’s not! One breath of 
Asconel’s clean clean sweet air, and 
he’s dying!” 

But so slowly! Was there not an- 
other charge in Tharl’s gun, to bum 
directly into Belizuek’s substance? 
Spart^ could feel the maddened

IF 




will to survive which the creature 
was now broadcasting like raw en- 
ergy, and so too could everyone 
else. In the living brains of those 
who surrounded him, human and 
alien thought were locked into ter- 
rible conflict, and — 

And it stopped. 

Exactly as though the sun had 
come out, the sense of death and 
disaster ceased, and Spartak allow- 
ed himself to hope for victory. He 
half-turned, and was met by a 
scream from the cripple Shry. 

“Belizuek lives! It’s only the ser- 
vant who’s died — burned out — his 
brain failed! Bring the captives over 
here!” 

Guards, still blindly obedient to 
Shry’s command, made for the pas- 
sively waiting Vix and Tiorin. 

*'Tell them to stop!’^ Spartak 
gasped at Bucyon. 

But Lydis was on her feet, thrust- 
ing herself between her overlord and 
the man who had dared to stand 
against him. 

“No!” she hissed, so close to 
Spartak that tiny drops flew from 
her rage-contorted mouth and struck 
his cheek. “Belizuek is All! Beli- 
zuek is the Master! Belizuek was 
before the galaxy was!” 

Time froze. The guards were 
poised to pinion Vix and Tior- 
m, the people were still too con- 
fused to act, and he could say noth- 
ing. Even crippled by the breach 
in his protective dome, there was 
no knowing what Belizuek could do 
if he were given a fresh victim to 
serve as a telepathic link between 
himself and his slaves. 

An idea? A glimmer of hope? 



Spartak pushed Lydis aside rough- 
ly and addressed Bucyon ooo§ 
more. “Tell the people what Beli- 
zuek does with his servants! Say 
what becomes of those who go bch 
hind the screen into his presence!" 

“He won’t answer,” Lydis spat 
“Your drug has spent itself, and I 
control his mind. Guards! Guards!" 

Indeed, Bucyon’s face had takes 
on the vacant look of an idiot He 
stood swaying and gazing oat over 
the Assembly without seeing it 
A sense of defeat which had nodi- 
ing to do with Belizuek’s emanations 
overcame Spartak. The guards 
closed on his brothers, Lydis laugh- 
ed madly in triumph — 

And Tharl let go the last charge 
from his energy gun. 

L ike a white-hot steel bar it blazed 
down toward the rent in the 
golden dome. 

In the final yard of its passage 
it speared Shry and turned him in- 
to a staggering horror wrapped in 
flame. Beyond him, only half spent 
on such a petty target, it burned 
deep, deep into the vitals of BeB- 
zuek, and Lydis screamed as though 
the pain were hers alone. 

A unison shock raced through 
the crowd. The guards about to 
seize the captives turned. The priests 
cried out in terror, Spartak in ro- 
lief. 

Then Vix moved. 

He shook himself as thou^ 
rousing from a long sleep, clubbed 
both fists together and brought them 
up into the kidneys of the guard 
who would have seized him. The 
man gave a yell of agony and clap- 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



T2S 




ptd his hands to the seat of the 
pain. Vix reached past him and took 
his sidearm and his sword in simul- 
taneous precise movements. The 
sidearm he thrust into Tiorin’s hand 
as the other man also came to him- 
self, and without a pause jabbed 
the sword’s point home in the ex- 
posed neck of the disarmed guard. 

He opened his throat in a cry 
which had not been heard since 
Bucyon usurped the Warden’s chair. 
It was like turning back the pages 
of the past. 

“For Ascone-e-e-^/!” 

And he was away. 

Spartak was giddy with the speed 
of it. His eyes could not follow the 
instant blur that his half-brother be- 
came, a red-topped living torch of 
disaster for those who stood in his 
way. Behind, calmer, Tiorin weigh- 
ed the gun he had suddenly ac- 
quired, then with a thoughtful look 
raised and aimed it. A bolt scatter- 
ed the priests from around the gol- 
den dome, sending them tumbling 
off the edge of its raised platform. 
Another dispersed those muddled 
guards who thought to come to the 
rescue of their fellows. Another dis- 
couraged a group of conscious trai- 
tors who were trying to get out of 
the far end of the Assembly. 

But by then Vix had cleared a 
path all the way to Spartak’s side, 
and five men lay coughing the blood 
which smeared his blade. He clap- 
ped Spartak on the arm and yelled 
at him. “A miracle, brother, a mira- 
cle! I love you for it!” 

And he was after Bucyon him- 
self, the sword swinging high to 
split the bemused usurper’s skull. 



“Stop!” Spartak cried. “He’s no 
more than a booby now — his mind’s 
gone!” 

“Let the people see!” Vix answer- 
ed savagely, and struck. 

With that final blow, even be- 
fore Bucyon toppled headlong, the 
berserk madness left him. In its 
place, there was a cold white fury 
that made Spartak shiver as he look- 
ed on it. 

Tiorin came forward to stand 
with his brothers. No one' lifted a 
hand to prevent him. 

“I’m Vix of Asconel!” Vix roar- 
ed at the frightened people. “Here’s 
Tiorin, your rightful Warden! Here’s 
Spartak our brother to whom we 
owe our deliverance and yours!’* He 
pointed with his sword, and the 
blade dripped red. 

“And here’s the last of those who 
led you by the nose!” Vix bellowed. 
“The woman Lydis who betrayed 
my brother!” 

He whirled, and was quick enough 
to grasp her by the robe as she 
made to flee. The robe tore, fell 
away, exposed her maggot-pale 
body to the pitiless glare of the 
noontide sun. 

There was utter silence. Spartak 
felt nausea rise to choke his throat. 

Lydis was not a human mutant, 
accidentally gifted with the power 
to read minds. 

She was a tool of Belizuek. And 
instead of breasts on the front of 
her torso, she had a black pulsating 
growth that squirmed and leaked 
a stinking ichor as it followed its 
alien parent into the doorway of 
death. 

The crowd saw. The crowd rose

vp, and panicked, and fled, and 
left the brothers to their solitary 
triumph. 

XXIV 

were together again, in the 
i X Warden’s suite of the palace: 
the brothers, and those who had 
most signally served Asconel during 
hs time of terror, among whom 
were Tharl and Eunora. The mutant 
firl sat a little apart, clutching in 
both hands a big cup of sweet fruit- 
juice, while the men relaxed over 
wine of Asconel’s finest vintage. 
Tharl had taken a place next ^ to 
her, as a symbol of apology for the 
way he had first reacted to the 
•cws of her talent. 

“TTiat’s what turned the tide for 
08 ,” Spartak murmured, thinking of 
#ie way Lydis’s robe had fluttered 
to the ground. 

^‘Well, obviously,” Tiorin agreed 
from the head of the table around 
which they had gathered. ‘Tt turn- 
ad my stomach, I tell you frankly. 
And I’d already begun to suspect 
•omething of the sort.” 

“But how could Hodat not have 
known?” Vix snapped. 

Tharl cleared his throat. “I’ve 
been making some inquiries. If 
you’ll forgive my admitting that I 
probed into the private affairs of 
your family .. .?” 

“Go on,” said Spartak. “Our 
private affairs are now of public 
Interest.” 

“Well put, sir. In fact, what turn- 
ed up was to your late brother’s 
great credit. There was no founda- 
tion for the common gossip about 



a liaison between him and Lydis 
He’d stuck strictly to his origins i 
intention of marrying a woman 
who’d advantage Asconel’s future 
by allying us with some other pros- 
perous world. He was deluded into 
believing that Lydis’s mind-reading 
was — well — at his service, so to 
speak, and he flattered and bribed 
her to make her stay on his side.” 

“Where did the marriage story 
get started, then?” Tiorin asked. 

“Who can say?” Tharl shrugged. 
“Perhaps she planted the rumor 
herself. We’ll never know now.” 

True enough. The death of her 
alien parasite had killed her within 
an hour. 

“Speaking of things to people’s 
credit,” Tiorin murmured, “I don’t 
believe I ever got around to com- 
plimenting you, Eunora. I’m sure 
Spartak and Vix have stood deputy 
for me, but now things are less hec- 
tic than they were, I must thank 
you. And ask you something, too.” 

He paused. Everyone grinned 
broadly. They had become perfectly 
accustomed to Eunora’s talent, and 
the last trace of the Empire’s anti- 
mutant policy had faded even from 
Tharl’s mind. 

4 4 T T I withstood the probing 
■Tl of both Lydis and Shry while 
I was giving the flowers to Bucyon,” 
Eunora nodded. I don’t think I shall 
ever know. All I remember is the 
sense of shock which I had when 
I realized the two things I hadn’t 
known beforehand: first, that Lydis 
was directly in contact with Beli- 
zuek, and second, that Shry was 
also, but far more — more firmly.” 



TOE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



127 




“The parasitic growth on his 
back,” Spartak put in, “must have 
weighed as much as he did.” 

“And felt like it,” Eunora agreed 
grimly. “All I can say is that when 
I reacted to the shock, I must have 
forced myself into the identity I*d 
taken on I was just a simple-mind- 
ed little girl, overawed at being in 
the great man’s presence, scared at 
my own daring in offering him the 
flowers ... I blanked out until I 
came to under the stand half an 
hour later, and then 1 had to hide 
to keep out of the way of all the 
people who were fleeing from this 
final horror, the exposure of Lydis.” 

“But that’s what turned the tide, 
as I said,” Spartak repeated. “Even 
with Belizuek dying, and cut off 
from mental contact with his slaves; 
even with Bucyon killed in front of 
tiiem, there were people in that 
crowd who’d staked their futures on 
Bucyon and to the Big Dark with 
the rest of the citizens. Let ’em 
rotr 

Tiorin’s face darkened. “Don’t I 
know iti Most of them came fawn- 
ing to me directly, saying didn’t I 
want the cooperation of those who 
had been administering the planet 
under Bucyon because they knew all 
the ropes now . Some of them 
were men I’d known in father’s day, 
too. And of course, a lot more of 
them tried to bribe their way off- 
world. But we caught most of them, 
I think.” 

“Excuse me, sirs,” Tharl put in 
diffidently, “^mething Fve been 
wondering . How was it that kill- 
ing the — the main Belizuek got rid 
of all the others so easily?*' 

128 



“Hmmm?” Spartak turned his 
head. “Oh, yes. I wasn’t absolutely 
right in what I told you back at 
Penwyr, but nearly so. Remember 
I told you that Belizuek was insane, 
and especially afraid of competi- 
tion, even from his own derived 
images?” 

Tharl nodded, frowning with 
concentration but making a gallant 
effort to follow Spartak’s exposition. 

“For fear that one of his — ah — 
duplicates should achieve independ- 
ence and usurp his uniqueness, he’d 
made sure the mental linkage be- 
tween them was very tight. It prov- 
ed too tight. The effect of death on 
the central organism was reflected 
in a psychic paralysis of all the 
others. They could have existed as 
separate entities — but he’d forbid- 
den them to.” 

He shrugged, and Tharl muttered 
thanks. 

“I’ll tell you something, sir,” he 
added after a moment. “You came 
to me later and congratulated me 
on the uncanny rightness of the 
timing for the last bolt I fired, yes?” 

“Agreed!” Tiorin said warmly. “It 
was a real crisis point — ” 

“Well, sir,” Tharl broke in, look- 
ing unaccountably depressed, “I’d 
saved that bolt, for -a mixture of all 
sorts of reasons. First I was going 
to save it for myself. Then I 
thought, if I’m discovered, all I 
need do is jump down this shaft 
I’m in — a fall of a hundred-odd 
feet into a rockhard floor should 
finish me off. So instead I saved it 
in case you were wrong about the 
way to kill Belizuek. I figured I 
could at least kill Bucyon if he 



IF 




went through with his plan to sacri- 
fice you.” 

“But you fired again before 1 
•truck Bucyon down,” Vix object- 
ed. 

“Yes, sir. I thought and thought, 
and for a long time I was worried 
because Spartak was standing so 
close to Bucyon, I couldn’t get a 
clear shot. Then finally T decided it 
was taking too long for things to 
settle down. I couldn’t have com- 
pleted the job. And there was a 
clear shot at Shry, who was after 
all Belizuek’s chief spokesman and 
chaplain to Bucyon and all the rest 
of it. I figured if Belizuek was al- 
ready dead, he’d be in a really fran- 
tic state, and he wasn’t — he was 
calling people up to help him, and 
peering into the hole my bolts had 
made, as 1 could see clearly through 
the telescope on my gun ... So 
I said, ‘What’s more likely to put 
a stiff dose of fear in their guts 
than to see Belizuek’s best-beloved 
shriveled like a leaf in a fire?’ And 
I let the last bolt go.” 

“To which decision we owe the 
fact that we’re here now,” Tiorin 
said soberly. 

44 Ayr ay I ask a question, War- 
Tharl said formally. 

“Go ahead.” 

“Are your brothers going to stay 
here now? I feel Asconel needs 
them still.” 

Tiorin glanced at the other two, 
inviting them to speak for them- 
sdves. 

“No,” Vix said gruffly, and got 
to his feet. He paced across to the 
window and stood with his back to 



them as he went on. “No, a fighting 
man is a center of discord on a 
peaceful world, and that’s what 
Asconel is going to be from now 
on. I’ll away back to my roving. 
And — and there’s something else, 
too.” 

He didn’t elaborate, but neither 
of his brothers had to ask what he 
meant. Vineta had died during the 
day following their capture by the 
priests from the injuries sustained 
when she was rfiot down. And for 
the first time in his life, the loas 
of one of his women had touched 
his heart. He could not bear to re- 
main on the world where Vineta 
had died. 

“You, Spartak?” Tiorin said, to 
distract them from the vaguely em- 
barrassed silence that followed. 

“No, I shan’t stay here either,** 
Spartak said at length. “Oh, I’ll n^ 
be leaving till I’m sure Asconel is 
on the proper orbit again, but in a 
year or so I’ll say farewell.” 

“I shall regret your loss,” Tioria 
said quietly. “But as you wish. Back 
to your studies on Annanworld, 
then?” 

“Annanworld? Oh no.” Spartak 
gave a smile that made him look 
briefly like a wild beast. 

“Why not?” Vix demanded, sur- 
prised. He turned away from the 
window to face them again. “The 
way I understood it, your order 
would take you back if you didn’t 
soil your hands with violence while 
you were away. And you didn’t. 
Everything you did to help over- 
throw Bucyon was of the nature of 
— well — of scheming rather than 
fighting. Or are they so super-subtle 



THE ALTAR AT ASCONEL 



12f 




they’d define what you did to him 
as violence?” 

“No, we distinguish force from 
violence, and force is occasionally 
unavoidable . But why should 
I saw ‘we’?” Spartak leaned back 
m his chair. “I’m not returning. I’m 
sure of that. 

“You see, after much cogitation 
I’ve come to a conclusion. My Su- 
perior, Father Erton, was half right 
as well as half wrong when he 
warned me against leaving for As- 
conel. The rightness lay in his say- 
ing that to stand against the — 
what do they call it? — the onset 
of the Long Night was beyond any 
man’s powers. What we’ve done here 
on Asconel is good, and worth it. 
But it’s not turned the tide of gal- 
actic decline, has it? Only built an 
island aroimd which Ae tide will 
flow. Perhaps the clearest warning 
lies in the fact diat one mentally 
sick survivOT of a race whi^ grew 
weary and departed befOTc we left 
our original system could bring one 
of our finest planets into total sub- 
jugation. 

“I’m going to look for the seeds 
of the first truly htiman gahictic 



conquest. Fm going to the rim, to 
the worlds where for ten thousand 
years the Empire shipped its mtir 
tants and its misfits, and where 
rumor says men — yes, men, for 
they’re born of human loins — 
build their own starships instead of 
borrowing the leavings of another 
species. I don’t know exactly where 
to make for, but a good start might 
be to resume our interrupted jour- 
ney to Nylock. Hm, Eunora?” He 
shot a twinkling grin at the mutant 
girl. 

“And when I find someone in a 
position to do something, I shall 
report on the existence of a world 
called Brinze. For the priests of 
Belizuek were human too, though 
they’d sold their birthright and their 
power of free thought. And before 
I die I hope to see the people there 
set at liberty as those of Asconel 
have already been.” 

The words died in the silent 
room. Finally Vix went to Spartak’s 
side and stood gazing down at him. 

“You’re right,” be said. “And if 
you want a ship and a pilot, say 
the word!” He put out his hand.
