Not even at a Worldcon would you get that 
wide a range of personalities (though 
Noreascon came close) . But the Beagle list 
has brought it off. To our booming Love- 
craft program we are adding the works erf 
P. G. Wodehouse, starting with three of his 
classic novels, Leave It to Psmith, The 
Small Bachelor, and Brinkley Manor 
—that last is a great Jeeves story. This is 
P. G. Wodehouse’s 90th birthday year, 
and he considers the Psmith novel (the P 
is silent, as in Ptarmigan) his favorite 
amongst his work. The Small Bachelor 
as technically about his best, and the 



Jeeves books as his favorite series. And if Wodehouse, after 70 years 



of writing, doesn’t know what’s good, who does? 



You may by now have read all of Beagle’s H. P. Lovecraft books— but 
have your friends? What better Christmas present than the boxed set 
of the Arkham Edition of H. P. Lovecraft— containing The Tomb, 
At the Mountains of Madness, The Lurking Fear, The Lurker 
AT THE Threshold, and The Case of Charles Dexter Ward? 
$4.75 for a goody that will whiten the recipient’s hair in a single night.

T he temptation to do a sequel 
to a novel that has proven pop- 
ular must be irresistible to most 
writers. Much of the hard work of 
creating has already been done. 
The background has been built, the 
characters are already established 
and all the writer has to figure out 
is what trouble he can conjure up 
for the next go-round — not too 
difficult a task if he can find a new 
villain or calamity to launch mat- 
ters. 

Besides, the readers liked the 
original, so they are all prepared to 
like more of the same. Look at the 
series of novels by Smith, Asimov 
and all the rest. 

The trouble with the whole con- 
cept is it only seems simple. A se- 
quel necessarily must be better 



than the first novel if it is to have 
equal appeal to readers. The back- 
ground is as familiar to them as to 
the writer — now they want some- 
thing more. A reshaping of the 
same elements won’t do. 

For the writer the trap is he has 
already done so much thinking 
about his particular gestalt that go- 
ing on is something like leaping 
from trig to calculus — the mind 
hates to start over with more 
axioms and reexamine the pur- 
poses of earlier thought. Most 
characters are not simply thought 
out — they develop under the strain 
of working, during the plotting 
and the writing. They come out of 
one continuous mood at the time 
and to pick them up again means 
dissecting old friends as if they

though Joval had the heretical 
thought that it would be easier if 
the Sending did not take place un- 
til midwinter when the tempera- 
tures averaged a more comforta- 
ble 25® C. But he quickly cut off 
that line of thought. The Sending 
was when the Sending should be 
and men did what they had to do. 
Such was the nature of the world. 

At midday the two-angular-de- 
gree-wide reddish-orange disk of 
Sun approached the time of the De- 
vouring. There, hanging in the sky, 
forever motionless, slightly south 
and west of the zenith, was the 
huge, mottled gray-green-blue- 
banded ball of Big Basta. It dom- 
inated the sky, was three times the 
size of the Sun and once each day, 
shortly past noon, it Devoured Sun 
in th? holy, magic, terrifying cycle 
of Devouring. 

Joval called his family to a halt, 
told them to lay down their bur- 
dens and assume the attitude of 
prayer. Sun neared the sky mon- 
ster, seemed to hesitate for a mo- 
ment, as if fearful of the faithful- 
ness of her children, then began to 
vanish into the maw of Big Basta. 
In a few moments the Woman-of- 
the-Sky was gone. Devoured, and 
the sky became totally dark, dark- 
er than ever at night, and there was 
a sudden coldness in the thin air. 
Star, Sun's tiny daughter, was visi- 
ble, a tiny blue-white disk just 
above the northern horizon this 
time of year, as were the hundreds 
of smaller stars and the vague 



band of the Milky Way stretching 
across the western horizon. 

J OVAL SONA RAMON 
prayed, as he had prayed each 
day of his life, for the return of 
Mother Sun. Jhe Man-of-the-Sky, 
great, ugly Big Basta who stood at 
the center of the universe, must 
have heard his prayers and the 
prayers of all men, for he showed 
sympathy and soon released Sun. 
The sky grew bright again. 

“Praise be to Big Basta,” Joval 
said in the sjng-song of ritual, “for 
he has released our Sun. Praise be 
to Sun, for she has not deserted 
us.” Then he gestured for the two 
women and the boy to rise, pick up 
their burdens and go on. 

They moved on across the plains 
toward the Ship and the Time of 
the Sending. 

The man who called himself 
Joval Sona Ramon, the Knife- 
maker, grandson of the famous 
Geriat Jason Sona Max, of the 
Greatfamly Heath, was a little over 
medium height, heavy, stocky, 
muscular, with faint traces of gray 
in his thick black hair. His skin was 
dark and leathery, despite the. se- 
clusion of the past summer, burned 
brown by the harsh ultraviolet light 
of Sun through the thin atmo- 
sphere. Surrounding the nipples of 
his chest, half hidden by the dark, 
curling hair, running in two intri- 
cate, blazing lines down his mus- 
cular abdomen, across his hips and 
curving down the insides of his

IF 




thighs to his ankles, were the bright 
red and gold tattoos of manhood, 
the once painful momentos of his 
acquisition of the status of a full 
adult, a free citizen and private 
priest of the gods of men. On his 
left shoulder was a stylized H, the 
symbol of the Greatfamly Heath. 
He was naked, wearing only san- 
dals on his feet and a wide leather 
belt around his waist, from which 
was suspended a large, heavy knife 
of his own manufacture and the 
purse that contained his flint and 
steel and tinder for fire building.* 
On his back were his pack of trade 
goods and a large skin of water. 

Amalthea Dauta Suzan, his eld- 
est wife, but twelve short years his 
junior, was as dark as he. She was a 
woman who had held much of the 
attractive looks of her youth — 
dark, deep, sensual eyes above a 
finely chiseled nose; full, smiling 
lips covering her remaining teeth; 
large breasts only now beginning to 
loose their fullness and slip down- 
ward; a waist only slightly thicker 
than it had been when Joval took 
her to be his wife; thighs still 
smooth and firm. All this was 
despite the bearing of children, the 
tilling of the fields, the harvesting, 
the long, hot summers deep 
beneath the earth in the burrows 
carved from the rock and soil. She 
carried on her body the intricate, 
delicate yellow and blue floral 
tattoos of a woman, etched across 
her breasts and down her body. 
Four green stars embellished her 



breasts, two above each nipple, one 
for the birth of each child who had 
lived past two seven-days. The 
stylized D on her left shoulder 
symbolized the Greatfamly Duna- 
gan, of which she had been a mem- 
ber before her marriage to Joval. 

T he youngest wife of Joval’s 
three, auburn-haired Filis 
Dauta Julianna, born of the Great- 
famly Dunagan, a distant cousin of 
Amalthea, was but eighty years 
old. The bloom of youth was still 
on her cheeks, though they were 
Sunburned dark, and her body was 
lush and full and had not yet borne 
a child. Her tattoos, blue and yel- 
low, as involved and delicate as 
Amalthea’s, were still almost fresh 
upon her body, having been there 
less than sixteen years and, of 
course, showed no hint of green. 
She had cost Joval three famly- 
kows, but she was worth them and 
more. She would bring him fine 
sons. 

Of his sons only the eldest, 
Masai, came with them. He had 
the dark hair and dark eyes and full 
lips of his mother Amalthea and 
the distended belly of all children. 
He was holding Filis’ hand, excited 
at being allowed to attend his first 
Sending, though he would not be 
permitted to enter the Ship itself. 
He would have to reach twice his 
age, a full sixty or sixty-five years 
— when the stubble would appear 
on his chin and the hair of his arm- 
pits and pubes would begin to

grow dark and thick like his fa- 
ther’s, when he would have been 
circumcised and, the gods willing, 
the wound would. have healed — be- 
fore he would be allowed to enter 
that most holy of places. But for 
now just seeing the Ship would be 
enough for the child. 

So these four went to this Send- 
ing, and all were dark-skinned and 
naked in the brightness of orange 
Sun, though in the packs they car- 
ried were robes and blankets to 
keep out the cold of night when 
they stopped to sleep. And all 
carried the parasites of men — lice, 
or things called lice, each with 
twelve legs and double blood- 
sucking mouths, ntoving among 
the head and body hairs of their 
hosts, drawing sustenance from 
the bodies of the unconcerned 
humans who carried them. 

The family of Joval Sona Ra- 
mon moved on and the barren 
plains before them seemed endless. 

Above, the sky was blue, a faint, 
thin, fragile blue with a touch of 
purple. In it were .a handful of cir- 
cling creatures that men called bats 
and very few clouds as yet, though 
later, when it grew a bit cooler, the 
clouds would come. With them 
would come the rains aiid the 
plants would begin to grow again. 
That would be after the Sending, 
when Joval was again on his farm 
and could cultivate the fields and 
wait while the rains fell and the 
crops at last came bursting from 
the seeds that Joval and Peak and 



Joval’s wives would put into the 
soil. The red and yellow crops 
would be of a dozen kinds of 
vegetables, threshen and potluk 
and nearbens and the three or four 
kinds of green plants that still grew 
on Thisda. In a way, Joval would 
be very glad to get back home, 
though he told himself that he 
would not miss the Holy Sending 
for a whole winter’s crop. He 
wasn’t sure that he meant it; he 
only hoped that he did. 

B efore them the plains sloped 
downward for a long distance, 
almost soft and gentle in their roll- 
ing, though now the colors of the 
plains were only the browns and 
ochers of summers, the dry, bar- 
ren deserts of summer. Later, when 
the late autumn rains came, the 
undulating plains would flower, red 
and yellow and golden and purple, 
grasses and vines and bushes and 
the fifty-meter-tall pithy reeds that 
Joval and his fellows called trees. 
Then the wild, diminutive, bur- 
row-dwelling creatures of the 
plains, mutated descendants of the 
animals brought by the Ancients, 
wildogs and B-cats and great wild- 
kows and half a dozen others, the 
native arthropods of Thisda, ten- 
legged spiders and six-legged scor- 
pions, all would come out of their 
summer hibernations. They would 
come to the flowering surface to 
live and eat and mate and gestate 
and give birth and kill and die 
among the plants that enveloped 



8 



IF 




the plains during the brief, glorious 
winter. 

But that was still several seven- 
days away and now the plains wore 
but the brown scorched nakedness 
of summer. Even Joval, who had 
lived all his days on the plains of 
Thisda, whose fether and grandfa- 
thers and great-grandfathers as far 
back as men recorded had also 
lived there, could see no beauty in 
them. But that was the way things 
were on Thisda and all a man 
could do was accept it. Such were 
his burdens. 

On they pushed across the 
plains, seven kilometers from the 
Devouring of Sun to the fall of 
night. Then, with the coming of 
darkness and its sudden cold, Joval 
ordered his family to stop. They 
put down their burdens, opened 
their packs to remove blankets and 
built a fire from the patties of dried 
famlykow dung that Joval carried 
in the bottom of his pack. 

Once the fire was burning well, 
Joval unstoppered his water skin, 
carefully feeling the weight of it in 
his hands. Water enough for the 
four of them for a seven-day and a 
half, almost enough to get them 
back home if they were careful. 
Though, if necessary, they could 
barter for water at the Trading that 
followed the Sending; if worse 
came to worst they could even 
drink the urine that Amalthea car- 
ried in her own water skin. Joval 
had drunk unprocessed urine be- 
fore many times in the summer 



when water was so scarce and 
death near. It was water and could 
be drunk if necessary, though he 
would much prefer the crude pro-v 
cessing that removed most of the 
body wastes suspended within it. 
Still, water was no problem — and 
there would be wine to drink on 
the Night Before the Sending. 

A malthea, kneeling on the 
dry ground, careful of the. 
open, festering sore on her leg that 
seemingly would never heal, 
handed Joval the gourd that she 
carried suspended around her neck 
on a leather thong. Joval carefully 
poured it half full of the fresh, 
warm water. Amalthea, as the 
eldest wife and bearer of the first 
son of Joval Sona Ramon, draiik 
first; then came Filis, then Masai, 
and Joval last, he being th^ 
strongest and least needful of 
water, according to tradition at 
least. 

Soon Amalthea opened the 
wrapped packets of famlydog 
meat, brushed away the gnats and 
midges that seemed to appear out 
of nowhere, broke off four large 
chunks and passed them around.. 
While Joval began to eat she of- 
fered each of them a handful of 
treshen seeds, large and moist and 
still warm from the heat of her 
body. 

Brief prayers were spoken to the 
principal gods and to the ghosts of 
the Others, thanks for their sur- 
vival through another day and re- 



TIAAE OF THE SENDING 



9 




quests for the day to come. Joval’s 
sweeping hand sprinkled drops of 
water around their camp, an offer- 
ing, a libation to the dry earth 
gods. Then the blankets were 
unrolled and preparations made to 
sleep. 

Young Masai slept wrapped in a 
blanket with his father’s youngest 
wife, sharing the warmth and un- 
washed odors of their bodies, while 
Joval and Amalthea wrapped a sin- 
gle large, rough blanket around 
themselves. 

For a few moment’s Joval’s 
hands played across the familiar 
body of his eldest wife, finding in 
the swellings and depressions, the 
dry skin and moist recesses a com- 
fort, a warm andTivihg closeness, 
a welcoming, beckoning softness. 
But that was all. This night he did 
not need to possess her fully — fa- 
tigue, perhaps, or excitement 
about the coming Sending; what it 
was he did not know. He kissed 
her once on the lips and let it go at 
that. In moments Amalthea’s 
breasts rose and fell with the calm 
regularity of sleep. 

J OVAL SONA RAMON was 
nearly one hundred and twenty 
years old, as he reckoned time, and 
at that he was still a fairly young 
man. During that time he had at- 
tended twenty-two Sendings and 
had been within the Ship fourteen 
times. The Sending that began the 
day after tomorrow would be no 
different, except that he was taking 



his eldest son with him for the first 
time. Then, he asked himself, why 
should he feel different about this 
one? He lay looking up at the huge, 
unmoving crescent of Big Basta^ 
that was swelling and growing 
brighter even as he watched, won- 
dering at the cause of his uneasi- 
ness. 

He visualized the place of the 
Sending, the great, tarnished, 
broken shape of the Ship, lying 
half into the canyon with a gaping 
tear in its side. The Ship, so the 
Geriats said, had brought men to 
Thisda so long ago that the 
memory of that day was no more 
than legend and men could not 
count back that far. And it was to 
the Ship that they went, all of the 
men of Thisda, once every four 
years, to the great control panels 
on the bridge, to the subspace 
radio — where one of their number, 
the selected Radioman, would 
touch the controls, and would, for a 
day. Send. And for another day the 
Radioman would attempt to 
Receive, though in all the time that 
men had been on Thisda, no 
Radioman had ever been success- 
ful at Receiving. 

Joval told himself. Perhaps that 
is why / feel strange. Perhaps this 
Sending will also be a Receiving. 

Perhaps his old enemy, Theo 
Sona Weyam, whom Joval had 
nearly killed so long before, but 
who had survived to become the 
Radioman of this Sending — per- 
haps Theo had studied the Manuals

IF 




well enough to understand the holy 
mysteries of Receiving. Perhaps he 
would hear word from the Men of 
Earth. 

Perhaps it will all be over soon, 
and they will come to take us to 
Paradise, 

But he did not really think it 
likely. Perhaps there was even no 
such place as Earth. Perhaps . 

He drew himself close to the 
warmth of Amalthea and scratched 
idly at the prickling claws of the 
parasites that crawled across his 
abdomen. After a time he slept; 

II 

D awn came with breathtaking 
suddenness, as it always did on 
Thisda, and Joval roused his 
family. After prayers and a break- 
fast of famlydog and treshen, with 
morning urination into Amalthea’s 
leathern pouch and a sprinkling of 
precious water for the ever-thirsty 
gods, they started on their way 
again. 

‘"We shall see the Ship by the 
Devouring,” he told Amalthea dur- 
ing a mid-morning pause, scan- 
ning the brown plains and rolling 
hills and dark horizon before them. 

She nodded, brushing the long, 
dark hair out of her eyes, and 
smiled at him without speaking. 
She had accompanied Joval on 
fully half of his trips to the Sending 
and it was not necessary for him 
to tell her such things. She knew 
them. 



Joval smiled back at her, one of 
his brief, rare smiles, thankful that 
he and not Theo Sona Weyam of 
the Greatfamly Innman had won 
the right to purchase her from her 
father. Then he urged Filis and 
Masai on, for it is not proper that a 
man and his family be late for the 
Sending. 

Sun was nearing Big Basta when 
they topped the rise and Joval 
pointed toward the distant valley, 
the great sweeping depression in 
the plains and the metallic glint 
that was the Ship. 

“There, you see,” he said. “We 
shall be there before night.” 

Shielding his eyes from the light 
of Sun, Joval peered at the Ship, or 
rather at the valley west of the 
canyon. He tried to make out the 
tiny dark specks that wpuld be the 
campsites of the others and the 
larger speck that would be the tent 
of the Geriats, the old men who 
passed for political and religious 
leaders of the men of Thisda. He 
did see the tent and perhaps a camp 
or two, though at this distance he 
could not be sure. Soon they would 
be closer and he could see. 

H e DID not look beyond the 
Ship at the strange, alien place 
which men held to be taboo and 
feared to approach closely. 

South of the Ship and the Place 
of the Sending, straddling the great 
fissure in the earth, were the dark, 
ghost-inhabited ruins of the 
Others, the remains of a city that 



TIME OF THE SENDING

had been millennia old when the 
Ancients came crashing down froni 
the sky. Beings other than men had 
dwelt there in the infinite ages of 
darkness, before the reckoning of 
time, beings who had come and 
built a great civilization and died in 
some cosmic cataclysm — died 
when Star came sweeping down 
out of the sky, burning blue-white, 
and altered the universe, so the 
Ancients had believed. Now only 
the ruins and the ghosts remained 
of the Others, the original inhabi- 
tants, and men feared the place of 
their dwelling. 

Joval and his family had started 
down the long, sloping hill into the 
valley of the Ship, almost within 
hearing range of the barking 
famlydogs that clustered in the 
valley, when the Devouring came 
upon them. They stopped and as- 
sumed the attitudes of prayer until 
Sun returned to them. 

Then they went on again. 



44|^REETING, Joval Sona 

vFRamon,” said Robt Sona 
Dave, the Chief Geriat, when Joval 
and his family stopped before the 
tent of the Geriats to pay their 
respects before finding their own 
camp site. 

Robt, Geriat of the Greatfamly 
Clegg, was not merely old, Joval 
thought, but ancient — over two 
hundred and fifty years, as time 
was counted on Thisda. He had 
been a big man in his youth and 



part of his largeness was still with 
him, though now his leathery skin 
hung in loose, ragged folds down 
his body; his single remaining eye 
was watery and growing dim, the 
other an empty, gaping hole. But 
he was the Chief Geriat — and once 
every four years the Captain — still 
a man of great power. Like Joval, 
he was naked save for his wide 
knife belt and a coppery medallion 
that hung around his neck, his 
symbol of authority, and the staff 
he used to support his weight. In 
the center of his shrunken, with- 
ered chest was the black tattoo ot 
a cross, the sacred symbol of Ger- 
iahood. His had a small circle 
around the intersection of the arms 
of the cross, another indication of 
his status. No other living man on 
Thisda wore the circled cross of 
the Chief Geriat. 

“Greeting, Robt Sona Dave,” 
Joval said, tipping his body for- 
ward slightly. “Praise the Great- 
famly Glegg. Good Sending to 
you.” 

“Good Receiving to you,” old 
Robt answered ritualistically. “I 
hope that your trip to the Valley of 
the Ship was a pleasant one.” 

“Fair enough,” Joval answered, 
remembering the sudden illness 
and death of the single famlykow 
he had brought. 

“I see that you are carrying your 
own burdens,” Robt said, as if 
reading Joval’s thoughts. “Have 
your famlykows had illness?” 

“Only one,” Joval answered.

IF 




*‘The one that carried our goods. It 
died suddenly yesterday morning 
of the redear and we were forced to 
carry our trade goods on our- 
selves.” 

“All of them?” the old Chief 
Geriat asked, twitching away a 
multi-winged insect that attemp- 
ted to settle in the moist socket of 
his vacant eye. 

“Oh, no. Not all. Some we had 
to leave behind. Amalthea’s 
pottery and most of my knives.” 
“That is unfortunate, Joval,” 
Robt said, “but perhaps you can 
persuade some men to go back with 
you to get them before the Trad- 
ing begins.” 

.. “I had hoped to ask, if there is 
time.” 

“Consider that you have asked. I 
will recommend it.” 

“Thank you, Geriat.” 

“Make your camp, then, Joval, 
for the night comes quickly and the 
wine traders will soon make their 
rounds.” 

Joval nodded. “I will.” 

“May Sun shine on you for all of 
your days,” Robt Sona Dave said 
solemnly in parting. 

“And may the Men of Earth 
come before you die, old one,” 
completed Joval. 

The old man smiled a lascivious, 
toothless smile as he started to turn 
away. “And keep a close watch on 
young Filis,” he said. “Many men 
will be after her once they have be- 
gun to drink the northern wine.” 

“I will, Geriat,” Joval answered 



and led his family away from the 
tent toward the area of the camps. 

A S SUN vanished below the 
near horizon and the light of 
the evening crescent of Big Basta 
began to illuminate the Valley of 
the Ship with its cold, polarized 
light, Joval and his family stood a 
few hundred meters from the 
gaping canyon that sundered the 
valley, looking up at the great 
metallic cylinder that the stories 
said had carried their ancestors 
across the gulfs between the stars. 

The Ship was ancient now, tar- 
nished and battered by the count- 
less winter storms that had broken 
across it and by the unbearable 
blazing of summer Sun. It lay half 
on its side, partially in the 
bottomless crevasse, split in the 
middle and broken, appearing to 
be on the verge of falling into the 
blackness below. But it would not 
fall, Joval knew, for it had lain thus 
for more years than he could count 
and had not fallen. It would 
probably lie in the same fashion 
long after Joval Sona Ramon and 
his family were put into the dark, 
dry soil of Thisda. 

Even after all these years, all 
these centuries, Joval could see the 
path that the Ship had taken when' 
it landed and the path it had 
followed after touching down — and 
where it had been dragged, for now 
it did not lie in the spot where it 
had first come down. With his eyes 
Joval followed those paths. 



TIME OF THE SENDING 



13 




Back up the valley, was the first 
depression, where the crippled Ship 
had come down from the sky. It 
had touched and skidded and tried 
to stop, but had been unable. It had 
skidd^ across the valley for two or 
three kilometers toward the canyon 
and the blackness deep within it. 
And as it skidded, it had turned 
half around, so that its side was 
parallel with the canyon. The great 
skid marks were still visible across 
the stones; the ages had not yet 
obliterated them. And finally, 
using the" last of the fire that had 
moved the Ship of the Ancients 
across the spaces between the stars, 
it had halted its skid, no more than 
meters from the yawning edge of 
the gorge. - - 

Only the benign will of the gods 
had saved the Ancients, had al- 
lowed them to come out of the Ship 
alive and look down into the can- 
yon into which they and the Ship 
had nearly fallen. 

And that was the time of the first 
Sending, so the stories went. The 
Ancients had Sent and then tried to 
Receive, but now the gods did not 
look upon them with their former 
favor. Earth did not reply to this 
first of the long, long Sendings. 

J OVAL looked at the huge bulk 
of the Ship, half turned, half fal- 
len into the canyon, at the 
tarnished battered surface and at 
the still-bright strips that ran along 
what had once been the top side of 
the Ship — the bright cross called 



the subspace antenna. One band of 
bright, glittering metal, a full meter 
wide, ran from a few meters be- 
hind the nose to within the same 
distance of the Ship's open tail. A 
second strip, also a meter wide, ran 
from midway on the right side, up 
over the top, crossing the first strip, 
and down to midway on the left 
side. A third strip, no more than 
half a meter wide, formed a circle 
five meters in diameter around the 
intersection of the two straight 
bands. This was the antenna, so the 
stories said, that Sent the subspace 
^messages into the sky— and this 
was why the Ancients had tried to 
move the Ship, though no man liv- 
ing today understood why. It was 
just so. 

How it had ever been possible to 
move the Ship, Joval did not know. 
The Ship was enormous, a good 
three hundred meters long, 
seventy-five meters in diameter at 
its thickest point and its sheer 
weight was impossible to guess. 
But the Ancients had been different 
from the men who lived today; 
they had had great beasts of burden 
called tractors and copters that 
men of today did not have and with 
them they had begun to move the 
Ship. 

The Ship had been moved some 
four hundred meters from its rest- 
ing place; such was the story told 
by the still visible marks along the 
side of the canyon, though the 
sloping ground had made it vir- 
tually impossible for them to get it 



14 



IF 




far away from the gaping edge. 
And they had begun to turn the 
Ship so that its antenna did not 
point toward the Man-in-the-Sky, 
for the Ancients somehow feared 
and perhaps even hated Big Basta, 
the great god who daily devoured 
Sun. But the rocky ground along 
the edge of the canyon was softer 
than the Ancients had realized. It 
had crumbled beneath the weight 
of the Ship. Men and their great 
towing beasts had been tossed into 
the canyon and even the Ship itself, 
rolling, sliding, breaking nearly in 
half, had seemed in danger of 
falling fully into the gorge where 
the edge gave way. The Ship had 
slid and split, but it had not gone 
fully in. And there it lay to this day. 

The Ancients had tried again to 
move the Ship, so the stories said, 
but had been unable. Their beasts 
had fallen into the canyon and 
many of the Ancients themselves 
lay dead in the bottomless depths 
or crushed beneath the Ship. Then 
the plagues had come and most of 
the Ancients had died. None of 
their children had ever tried to 
move the Ship again. 

So it had lain on the edge of the 
canyon, visited once every four 
short years for the Sending. 

Ill 

W HEN Joval and his family 
returned to the crude lean-to 
and the smoldering dung fire the 
wine traders were making their 



rounds. This was the Night Before 
the Sending, a time to drink wine 
and eat and make love and rejoice 
in what life the gods had given to 
the men of Thisda. 

Since most of the trade goods 
were buried near the place where 
the famlykow had died, Joval had 
little with him to trade, other than 
a large sack of seeds and three of 
the knives for which he was most 
famous. The small-eyed wine trad- 
ers, men from the distant north 
along the Great Inland Sea, had 
little use for the seeds from the 
farm of Joval Sona Ramon, but 
knives — well, all men needed 
knives for killing wildkows and 
wildogs and B-cats and other men. 
A wineskin for each knife was a 
bargain for both Joval and the 
wine traders. 

They parted happy, wishing each 
other a good Sending, a true Re- 
ceiving and many sons. 

Filling Amalthea’s gourd to the 
brim, Joval drank the warm, bitter 
wine, smiling at the bite of it on his 
tongue, the burn of it as it went 
down his throat. Yes, it was good 
wine, worth his knives, he thought, 
and drank another gourd. 

Amalthea, Filis and even little 
Masai each had a gourd of the wine 
and smiled at the unfamiliar 
warmth of it in their stomachs. 

“This will be a good Sending,” 
Joval said, drinking his third 
gourd, then wiping his mouth with 
the matted hair of the back of his 
hand. “I feel it within me,” he went 



TIME OF THE SENDING 



15 




on. “The famlykow’s death was a 
bad omen, but not as bad as I 
thought. No, all is well.” And he 
finished the gourd and refilled it 
and passed it on to his wives. 

Somewhere near the tent of the 
Geriats, where the countless famly- 
dogs barked in anticipation of the 
scraps from the coming feast, 
someone had begun to play a 
melody on reed pipes. Soon a 
stringed instrument that Joval 
could not identify joined in— a 
voice picked up the words and they 
were strange, ancient, alien words 
that said: 

The option of the thirty-nine 
took the loneliness. 

Beside it, leaving just brown 
clay; - 

The Men of Earth do not come 
out of their homes; 

Or like the local ether, sitting, 
looking. 

Oh, improbable, improbable 
escapades 

Under the stars; 

Thoughts, nakedness, alone; 

Our victory, our loss; 

Accepted, but not comfortable, 
A ny planet, carbon-based . 

T he words went on. Perhaps 
they had once had meaning, 
somewhere, somewhen, but not to 
Joval or his kind. 

“Come,” he said, rising to his 
feet, slinging the half empty wine- 
skin and a full one across his shoul- 
der. “There is another song to sing 
and meat to eat and wine to drink. 



This is the Night Before the 
Sending.” 

His two wives also rose, Amal- 
thea quickly, Filis with something 
like uncertainty in her face, for 
this was the first Sending that she 
had attended as a married woman 
and she was somewhat unsure of 
herself and of how she should be- 
have. 

“Don’t worry,” Amalthea whis- 
pered to her, just loudly enough 
for Joval to hear. “Our husband is 
good and loyal to the Way and this 
is the Night Before the Sending.” 

Filis smiled uncertainly. 

“Masai,” Joval yelled over his 
shoulder as he began to walk away 
from the camp. “Keep the fire 
going. You may drink from the 
other wineskin, but not too much.” 

“Yes, father,” the boy said obe- 
diently. 

Joval smiled to himself, remem- 
bering how it had been when he was 
a boy, how he had drunk too much 
wine and let the fire go out and 
crept down to the circle of light 
around- the tent of the Geriats to 
see what it was that the adults did 
on the Night Before the Sending. 
So it would be with Masai and it 
was well. For that is what a boy 
should do on the Night Before the 
Sending. How else was he to learn? 

Twigs and reeds and a dozen 
other kinds of combustibles had 
been piled before the tent of the 
Geriats and set afire. Near the 
flames there was bright, flickering 
light and undulating shadows and 



16 



IF 




warmth that drove away the chill of 
the night, as did the wine which all 
were drinking. Long spits extended 
over the edges of the flames, 
skewering the skinned bodies of 
fatted famly dogs and goats and 
famlykows, their blood and fat 
dripping, sizzling into the flames. 
The spits were turned by the oldest 
wives of the Geriats — withered, 
toothless old crones, their flat 
breasts flapping against their dis- 
tended bellies as they moved. In- 
sects flitted and the rich scent of 
roasting meat hung in the smoke 
above the flames, momentarily 
hiding the ripe, rancid odors of 
garbage and human and animal 
wastes that permeated the Place of 
the Sending. 

O NE by one those around the 
fire had put aside their vermin- 
infested robes and blankets and 
stood as naked as they would on a 
warm autumn day. And they sang 
and drank wine and ate meat and 
made plans for the pairing. For 
some the planning stages were past; 
they had paired and the simple 
fondling, caressing games of adults 
had already begun, games that 
would lead to greater pleasures and 
perhaps to babies. 

Between the fire and the tent of 
the Geriats stood the great may- 
pole of the Sending, a brightly 
painted and frankly sexual replica 
of the male organ, a phallic symbol 
to invoke the friendlier gods, ask- 
ing them for a fruitful winter’s har- 



vest and many sons; the Time of 
the Sending was also the beginning 
of the growing season. And often 
the gods smiled, for Joval’s crops 
were golden at winter’s end and his 
family growing. The gods willing, 
both Amalthea and Filis would 
bear sons three and a half years 
hence when their time came to 
deliver children conceived on this 
Night Before the Sending. 

Old Gordon the Castrate limped 
painfully up to one of the roasting 
goats and tore off a chunk of meat 
with his clawlike hands. No one 
reproached him,- for all knew that 
he was mad and suffered un- 
speakably from the great wounds 
in his abdomen and pelvis — the 
wounds of a savage B-cat pack that 
had attacked his farm and killed all 
of his family but himself, and very 
nearly him. The other beggars and 
cripples, more sane and mindful of 
custom, waited until the old wives 
of the Geriats cut the meat with 
sharp knives and passed it around. 

Three men played instruments, 
two reed pipes and the stringed in- 
strument that Joval had heard be- 
fore. And half a hundred voices 
sang a crude song that spoke of the 
Paradise beyond the sky and the 
day when mfen would come from 
Earth to take them all to that won- 
derful place. 

Green are her valleys, green in the sun, 

A nd white are her tall mountain peaks; 
Blue are her oceans, reflecting the sky, 

A nd blue are her lakes and her creeks; 
White are the clouds that float in her sky.

And black is the loam of her fields. 

Green are her prairies, green are her hills. 
And s weet and goodly their yields. 

Tall are her cities that rise in the sky. 

And straight are the highways between; 
Silver the craft that speed through the air, 

A nd pass o^er the blue and the green. 

White is the sun that climbs in her sky, 

A nd white is her moon in the night; 

Red are her sunsets and red is her dawn. 
Golden and lovely and bright . 

A cross the fire Joval caught 
sight of the twisted face of 
Theo Sona Weyam. Theo had 
apparently already seen Joval and 
his family and his eyes seemed now 
to be fixed on Amalthea, whom he 
had lost so many years before. Any 
hatred that Joval had felt for Theo 
was gone now, and he raised his 
hand in greeting, but Theo turned 
away suddenly and vanished. Joval 
shook his head and ignored the 
incident. 

Someone called for Melinda, the 
youngest daughter of Hansford 
Sona, Martin’s wife Gwel, to come 
before them and dance. But 
Melinda had been married to Frid 
Sona Turner the Midwinter before 
and was hesitant to dance before 
them all. 

- “Frid,” Joval calle4, seeing Me- 
linda’s husband standing near the 
huge fire, a wineskin upturned, 
“you will not prevent our seeing 
Melinda dance this Sending, will 
you?” 

“Joval!” Frid called back. 
“Come taste my wine. Knife- 
maker.” 



Joval, followed by Amalthea and 
Filis, went to where Frid Sona 
Turner stood alon^ with two or 
three other men who had been 
watching a group of young women 
and speculating. 

“It is good to see you, Joval,” 
Frid said. 

Frid Sona Turner of the Great- 
famly Heath, a distant relative of 
Joval’s, was a tali, strongly built 
man some ten or twelve years 
younger than Joval. A farmer and 
metal worker, Frid was a maker of 
plows as his father and grandfather 
had been before him. He was dark- 
skinned and tattooed from chest to 
ankles in red and gold. A great 
livid scar ran down his left hip and 
thigh. Many years before he had 
been gored by a bull wildkow and 
still walked with a painful limp, 
though his strength was equal to 
that of any man. 

“And you, Joval answered. 
“How is Turner Sona Lyle?” 

“"My father is well enough for an 
old man,” Frid said, “He is ill with 
aching bones and stayed behind 
this Sending. Not coming nearly 
broke his heart.” 

“It is sad to see a man like Tur- 
ner come to old age,” Joval said, 
accepting Frid’s offered wine. 
“Still, Frid, we would all like for 
Melinda to dance for us.” 

“She is my wife now,” Frid said 
laughing. “She dances for me.“ 

“It would do no harm for her to 
dance for us all,” Joval told him. 
“Well — ” Frid pondered. “Well, 



18 



IF 




I will allow Melinda to dance if 
you will allow Fills.” 

“But I am no dancer,” Fills 
objected, half stepping behind 
Amalthea as if seeking protection. 

“With beauty like yours, you 
must be a dancer,” Frid said, 
something between a leer and a 
smile on his face. 

F I LIS looked first at Joval and 
then at Amalthea, then back to 
Joval. Amalthea spoke first. 

“Joval, let her dance.” 

The Knifemaker laughed. “Very 
well. Both Melinda and Fills shall 
dance, but Melinda first.” He knew 
very well that Fills would probably 
not be asked to dance by Frid. 
Dancing was not what Frid had in 
mind for Joval’s youngest wife. 

Frid turned to where Melinda 
stood a few meters away talking 
with her mother. “Melinda,” he 
yelled, “it is decided. Joval insists. 
You shall dance.” 

“But, Frid — ” Melinda started 
to call back. 

“Dance, woman!” 

Melinda shrugged, nodded fare- 
well to her mother and strode to 
the edge of the fire where the men 
played their instruments. For a 
moment she seemed to hesitate, 
then smiled, shucked her burly 
robe and stood for a moment na- 
ked, silhouetted against the roar- 
ing fire. 

The young wife of Frid Sona 
Turner, called Melinda Dauta 
Gwel, was a rarity among the peo- 



ples of Thisda. Antique genes, dat- 
ing back to the times of the An- 
cients, had risen during her con- 
ception, giving her a skin that was 
far fairer than most, hair that was 
golden and fine, bleached more 
golden still by Sun. Her eyes were 
large and liquid, with a strange, 
beckoning gray-green color and 
flashed with a teasing sensuality. 
No more than eighty-five years 
old, Melinda was Just now a grown 
woman, and her lush, sensual body, 
decorated with the tattoos of blue 
and yellow, had not yet earned the 
green stars of motherhood. She 
was a prize for which Frid had 
worked long and hard and paid a 
great price in famlykows. 

Alternately closing one nostril 
and then the other with her thumb, 
she blew her nose clear of ash and 
the smell of smoke, then breathed 
deeply and waited for the three 
musicians to decide among them- 
selves what to play. 

Finally the music quickened, and 
the girl l^gan to dance. 

“A lovely wife,” Joval said. 

“True,” Frid replied, though he 
was obviously not looking at his 
own wife, but at Joval’s youngest. 

Turning up his deflated wine- 
skin, Joval emptied it, tossed it to 
the ground, spat in the dust and 
pulled the stopper from the second. 
Turning to offer it to Amalthea, he 
saw that she was gone, and smiled. 
So it was on the Night Before the 
Sending. She would return to the 
camp before the first light of dawn. 



TIME OF THE SENDING 



19 




and that was as it should be. 

Having filled his mouth with 
wine from the second skin, Joval 
nodded to Frid and slipped away 
before Filis could turn and 
discover that he, too, was leaving. 
Filis would be fine, he thought, 
once she had adjusted. And Frid 
would be kind to her. 

M elinda danced savagely, 
sensually, with the untutored 
grace of one born to dancing, until 
she nearly collapsed with exhaus- 
tion. But Joval, the friend of her 
husDand and her father, Joval Sona 
Ramon, the Knifemaker, was there 
to hold her and offer her wine and 
sit silently beside her while she 
regained her breath"! 

'Thank you, Joval Sona Ra- 
mon,” she said slowly, teasingly 
formal as she spoke, though her 
eyes said that she was not dis- 
pleased with the man that her hus- 
band had offered and would accept. 

“You dance wonderfully well, 
Melinda Dauta Gwel,” Joval re- 
plied with the same false formal- 
ality. 

“Thank you again.” 

Joval took a deep drink of the 
wine, felt his head begin to spin 
pleasantly, then handed the skin 
back to the naked girl. 

“Frid has had his eyes on that 
young wife of yours,” she said after 
drinking, scratching at the back of 
her neck for a louse that had sunk 
one of its heads deep into her flesh. 
“And I have had my eye on that 



yoting wife of his,” Joval answered, 
his desire for her already physically 
manifest. 

“So I gathered,” Melinda said, 
glancing up, appearing coy and 
shy, though her hand fell upon his 
thigh. 

“There are too many people 
here,” Joval said, though the crowd 
had now begun to diminish; 
couples, one after another, crept 
off into the semi-darkness of night 
and the light of Big Basta. 

Rising, Joval helped her to her 
feet, then led her around the tent 
of the Geriats, into its long, deep 
shadows and the nearest thing to 
total darkness available. 

Melinda paused for a moment to 
relieve heself, then went on with 
him. 

Twice, walking carefully, listen- 
ing to the dwindling music and to 
faint sighs of pleasure, they were 
forced to avoid other couples who 
had preceded them, but soon they 
found a place to be alone, where 
none were within touching 
distance, at least. Joval spread his 
robe on ground that was growing 
colder by the minute and drank 
again from the wineskin. 

“You are a lovely woman, Me- 
linda,” he said, standing over her, 
looking down at the young, full 
body, the golden mass of hair fall- 
ing across her shoulders and cas- 
cading down her back, the swelling 
of her breasts and the marks of her 
tattoos bearly visible in the half 
darkness. 



20 



IF 




“Don’t talk, Joval,” she whis- 
pered in reply, pushing the 
wineskin away as he offered it. “I 
need no more wine.” 

Joval dropped the skin to the 
ground and gently pushed her back 
against the robe that lay spread 
beneath her. 

Melinda’s body was warm and 
soft, ripe for the loving of a man. 
And he found that she was very, 
very good at giving a man what he 
wanted. This he discovered more 
than once during the short night. 



IV 

W ITH the cpming of dawn on 
the Day of the Sending, Joval 
arose with a painful head and loose 
bowels and the ache of fatigue in 
his legs. He had found his way back 
to camp before the coming of light, 
and had less than an hour of sleep 
before Amalthea shook him 
awake. 

“Rise, Joval. The Sending 
begins soon,” she said. 

Joval rubbed his eyes, pulling the 
rough blanket around his shoulders 
for warmth, and twice slapped his 
bearded cheek to drive away the 
sleep. 

Masai and Filis, huddled togeth- 
er under the same blanket, still 
slept, snoring in rhythm. 

“Don’t worry,” Amalthea said, 
guessing Joval’s concern, glancing 
over at the younger wife. “She 
pleased Frid and he her. Now eat 



and hurry. It is not seemly to be 
late.” 

Between mouthfuls of fresh 
meat, half burned, half raw, Joval 
tried to ask Amalthea with whom 
she had spent the night, but she 
smiled and refused to tell him. 

Frustrated but not angry, Joval 
rose, kissed Amalthea lightly and 
went to the tent of the Geriats. 

Within the huge, ancient tent 
kneeled all of the adult men of 
Thisda who were able to attend 
while the Geriats prayed aloud to 
all the gods, asking particularly 
that the radio gods look kindly 
upon this Sending and grant them 
also Reception tomorrow. 

Then Theo Sona Weyam was 
called before the Geriats. 

The Radioman, a free citizen of 
the Greatfamly Innman, was as tall 
as Joval, though more slightly 
built; he was a man fast on his feet 
in a fight and quick to anger. One 
sign of that anger was a long, red 
scar that ran down the right side of 
his face, puckering his mouth and 
giving him a permanent grimace. 
That was the scar of the knife of 
Joval Sona Ramon, given Theo 
many years before when they had 
fought over the purchase of 
Amalthea Dauta Suzan. Joval had 
won that fight for Amalthea and 
Theo had apparently never 
forgiven him for it. 

Nevertheless, Joval was willing 
to forget their feud at this Sending, 
when Tlieo assumed the holy 
function of Radioman. 



TIME OF THE SENDING

Theo slowly advanced toward 
the six Geriats who stood at the far 
end of the lent. 

Since the day had already grown 
hot, nearing 30® or 35® C, all the 
men had left their blankets and 
robes behind them with their 
families and were naked as they 
crowded into the tent. Only the six 
Geriats were dressed, as was the 
custom, in clothing that imitated 
as nearly as possible the clothing 
that the Ancients had worn when 
they first came to Thisda. 

O LD Robt Sona Dave, Geriat of 
Ihc Greatfamly Clegg and the 
Chief Geriat, wore the uniform of 
Starship Captain, for on this day 
and the next he ym Captain of the 
Ship. The other Geriats were dres- 
sed as First Officer, Simon Sona 
Christopher, Geriat of the Great- 
famly Heath; Second Officer, Arn 
Sona Mark, Geriat of the Great- 
famly Innman; Astrogator, Henry 
Sona Floyd, Dunagan; Engineer, 
Grego Sona James, Carter; and 
Damage Control Officer, Don 
Sona Rae, Geriat of the 
Greatfamly Bernard. A seventh 
uniform lay on the low table before 
them and this was the worn gray 
uniform of the Communications 
Officer. 

“Theo Sona Weyam,” the Cap- 
lain said as the Radioman stepped 
before tlie table and took the posi- 
tion of humility, “you are the 
chosen Communications Officer 
for this Sending and Receiving. Do 



you understand this and your 
responsibilities?” 

“Yes, Captain,” Theo answered 
ritualistically. 

“Do you have the Holy Manu- 
als?” 

“Yes, Captain.” Theo offered 
him the three worn books that he 
carried in his hands: Guide to the 
Operation of Subspace Radio 
Model AU-6-G, Revision IV; 
Basic Subspace Communications 
Theory; and Advanced Sub- 
nuclear Physics Simplified, 

“Have you studied these 
Manuals well and prayerfully?” 

“Yes, Captain. 7 

“Are you prepared to Send and 
to Receive?” 

“Yes, Captain, the gods 
willing.” 

“Then 1 hereby appoint you 
Communications Officer of the 
Ship.” 

Old Arn Sona Mark, the Second 
Officer, lifted the gray garments 
from the table and handed them to 
Simon Sona Christopher, First 
Officer, who in turn gave them to 
the Captain. 

“Communications Officer Theo 
Sona Weyam, here is your 
uniform. Wear it proudly.” 

“I humbly thank you, Captain, 
and swear that my actions shall 
never disgrace this uniform." 

Theo rose, accepting the cloth- 
ing, but did not put it on. Before 
he did so a long, elaborate cere- 
mony of cleansing would be per- 
formc l. would remove the

last traces of here and now from 
Theo and, in theory at least, make 
him into an Ancient. 

S INCE this was a ceremony that 
Joval had witnessed a number of 
times before, it had lost much of its 
magic for him. While it was taking 
place he allowed his mind to 
wander back to the farm where 
middle wife, Andre Dauta Sue, 
would be taking the young children 
out of the deep, cool burrow into 
the bearable warmth of early 
autumn. Young Peak, now more 
than a boy but less than a man, 
would be seeing his sixtieth autumn 
and winter, an age when a young 
male child learned of the ways of 
adults. Joval had taught him much: 
the times of planting; the ancient 
methods of dry-irrigation; the 
times of harvest; the forging of 
steel and the making of knives; how 
to read and write to better 
understand the mysteries of the 
Traditions and the Way and the 
old, old stories of their origins. 
And now, while his chest still ached 
with the pains of puberty, Andre 
would have begun teaching young 
Peak the ways of a man and a 
woman, the touch and feel, the 
arousing desire, the coupling and 
the fulfillment. That was as it 
should be, for there were no girls of 
Peak’s age within many kilomet- 
ers of the farm of Joval’s family, 
and who else was there to teach the 
boy such things? 

So, Joval thought without jeal- 



ousy, they would have awakened 
that morning. Peak and Andre, 
and enjoyed their bodies with each 
other, and then they would eat and 
set out to do their work. Soon they 
would begin to remove the long, 
sturdy reeds from their storage 
place and then take them and set 
them in the sockets of the 
foundation of the house., Jak and 
Fran and tiny Dave, as young as 
they were, would be helping Peak 
and Andre to raise the walls of 
their winter home. Later they 
would help gather thatch that 
would be used to form the roof of 
the hut which hopefully would keep 
out the autumn rains that would 
soon begin. When their labors were 
done they would sprinkle water for 
the gods and wait for Joval and the 
others to return from the Sending 
so that the fall planting could 
begin. 

After a while the cleansing cere- 
mony was over and Theo, his back 
red from the scourging of supple, 
damp reeds, his body dripping 
sweat, donned the shapeless, 
ill-fitting uniform. Now he was the 
Radioman. 

‘‘Let the Sending begin,” said 
Robt Sona Dave, the Captain, and 
the slow procession started out of 
the tent toward the Ship, chanting 
an ancient hymn. 

E very third man carried a 
torch as they made their way 
into the darkness of the Ship, for 
the use of the Ship’s precious

power was not allowed until the 
Crew had assembled on the bridge. 
Then the Captain would order the 
Engineering Officer to give the 
bridge power — and the incredibly 
ancient power ceils, somehow still 
working after all these ages, would 
give the bridge light and the 
subspace radio the pow.er that it 
needed to Send. 

Hot as it had become by now, 
perspiration beading on his naked 
skin, Joval felt a chill in the 
corridors of the Ship, the same 
chill that he had felt each time he 
had been within it. Here age and 
mystery met his knowledge of his 
own ignorance and the ignorance 
of all of his people. The Ancients 
had known so terribly much more 
than Joval and Theo and Robt and 
all the others could even imagine. 
How could they ever hope to Send? 
Or Receive? 

But it must be done, he told him- 
self. This is the Way. There is no 
other. Forever. Amen. 

The Officers entered the bridge. 
The others assumed their places in 
line according to their age. Joval, 
being older than many, was 
allowed to enter the bridge, though 
he stood distant from the subspace 
radio position; through the press 
of bodies he could see little of what 
took place there. It did not matter. 
Jovafs seeing the actual Sending 
would make little difference. All 
that mattered now was Theo Sona 
Weyam. He had studied the 
Manuals well enough? Did he truly 



know how to Send and Receive? 
Would the gods allow it this time? 

The Captain, Robt Sona Dave, 
looking less old now, stood before 
the subspace radio and intoned a 
prayer that must have dated back 
to the time of the Landing or 
shortly after, for the words were 
strange and at times hardly 
prayerful: “For God’s sake,” Robt 
chanted, “let this damned thing 
work this time. All we ask is one 
brief contact with Earth, a 
moment . .” 



F inally, when the prayer was 
done, Theo, his twisted mouth 
showing no expression, seated him- 
self before the radio controls, said 
his own private prayer and asked 
the Captain to give him power. 

“Engineering, power for the sub- 
space radio,” Robt Sona Dave said 
loudly. His words were picked up 
by the man beside him, passed on 
to the next man and the next, out 
of the bridge and into the corridor, 
down to the last in the line, the 
youngest allowed within the Ship 
this Sending — a downy-cheeked 
youth, his red and gold tattoos of 
manhood still raw and painful as he 
moved, his foreskin still a healing 
scar. 

The youth grabbed the words as 
they fell on his ears, turned and ran 
back down the dark corridors to 
the engineering department where 
he gave the message to Grego Sona 
James, who stood there by torch

light, dressed in the uniform of the 
Engineering Officer. The Geriat, 
upon hearing the order, stepped 
forward, peered at the complex 
panel of switches through rheumy 
eyes, selected the one that was the 
most worn, flipped it into an 
upward position and said a short 
prayer. 

At that moment, back on the 
bridge, a single green light in the 
lower left hand corner of the sub- 
space radio control board blinked 
to life. 

The Captain, after offering the 
power gods a short, ancient prayer, 
said to Theo Sona Weyam, “Mr. 
Communications Officer, please 
contact Earth and inform them of 
our difficulties.” 

“Yes, sir,” the Communications 
Officer answered in a ritualistic 
tone. 

Beside Theo Sona Weyam was a 
low, crude table upon which he had 
laid the three Manuals. One of the 
holy books, the one entitled Guide 
to the Operation of Subspace 
Radio AN-6-G, Revision IV, was 
open and Theo referred to it con- 
stantly as he began the sequence 
of adjustments that should begin 
the Sending. Despite the fact that 
he knew the Manual by heart and 
had studied every last surviving 
word each day for the past four 
years, Theo did not dare to rely on 
his memory alone during the Send- 
ing. One single misstep might so 
anger the radio gods that the Send- 
ing would not take place. 

TIME OF THE SENDING 



F ive panel meters, registering 
the amount of power fed to 
each of the unit’s five major 
sections from the power supply, 
showed life almost at once. 
Carefully Theo adjusted the knobs 
below the meters until the needle of 
each rested exactly at the center 
point. When the final meter was 
adjusted, the assembled men 
sighed; the first stage was 
completed and the gods were still 
smiling. The Sending had begun 
well. 

A row of toggle switches lay 
along the right side of the main 
transmitter panel, and though the 
lettering that had once identified 
them was worn away, an illustra- 
tion in the Manual clearly labeled 
each of them. Following the pro- 
cedure outlined step-by-step in the 
Manual, Theo went down the se- 
ries of switches, flipping them up- 
ward, pausing until the correspond- 
ing green light came to life, then 
going on to the next. Transmitter 
VFO — on. Exciter — on. Emitter 
Bank — on. Automatic Frequency 
Selector — on. Power Amplifier 
Loading — on. Modulator — on. 
Subspace Converter — on. 

Stage two completed success- 
fully and the gods praised, Theo 
went on to the third and final stage, 
the adjustment of the carrier 
strength and modulation levels. At 
last the sub-space radio’s dials and 
meters told him that all was ready; 
oscillators within the super- 
microminiature solid state and 

25 




moly-level components were 
generating signals. The signals, 
amplified, heterodyned, stepped up 
in power and moved up in frequen- 
cy, developed electromagnetic sig- 
nals of tremendous power upon 
which the subspace, faster-than- 
light waves would be impressed by 
the modulation conversion units. 
With a touch of his finger to a 
switch, electromagnetic energy 
would form on the cross of the hull 
antenna — energy that would 
further engender subspace energy 
that would leap from the metallic 
surface at speeds far in excess of 
that of light, that could cross the 
long, long light-years to Earth in 
minutes. All was ready. 

“Captain,” said Radioman Theo 
Sona Weyam, “all systems are go. 
The subspace radio is prepared to 
Send.” 

“Proceed,” said the Captain. 



T HEO’S finger slowly went to 
the final button and with some- 
thing between fear and elation in 
his eyes he slowly depressed the 
button and began to speak the 
ancient ritual of Sending into the 
microphone, the same words that 
had been spoken by the first 
Radioman so long before. 

“Colonial Starship Esanda call- 
ing Earth,” Theo began slowly in a 
sing-song fashion. “This is Colo- 
nial Starship Esanda calling Earth. 
We have made a forced landing in 
the planetary system of UR-420- 



48. We were hulled by a meteor 
coming out of pseudospeed. Lost 
most of our reaction mass — and 
we no longer have pseudospeed po- 
tential. Repeat, we no longer have 
pseudospeed potential. We are 
stranded.” 

Many of the words were 
meaningless to Joval, though men 
had speculated upon their 
meaning for ages. “Pseudospeed,” 
for example. What in all the 
universe could that be? 

“We’re on one of the planets or- 
biting the Ko component of the bi- 
nary star system; actually we’re on 
a nearly E-type satellite of a Jovian 
world— mass of something like .64 
Earth. The air is thin but breath- 
able, but it’s hotter than hell here. 
The planets orbit damned close to 
the primary. There seems to be no 
intelligent life here now — but 
there once was, but it appears to 
have been wiped out when the oth- 
er component of the binary, an A 1 
star, came in too close some hun- 
dred and fifty thousand years 
ago. 

Theo paused to wipe his hands 
on his uniform trousers, then went 
on. 

“Damage to the ship in landing 
and a mutated local disease have 
decimated the crew and colonists. 
We don’t know how much longer 
we can hold out.” As he spoke the 
Radioman’s voice rose in pitch 
trying to imitate the way in which 
those first frantic messages had 
been sent. “Earth, if you hear 



26 



IF 




US — for God’s sake, help us. Get us 
off this damned place.” 

And so the Sending went, the an- 
cient words repeated, the ancient 
plea for help, for rescue. 

Time passed and the Sending 
continued. 

V 

L ate in the afternoon, far past 
the time of the Devouring, hun- 
ger and the most basic of his bod- 
ily needs got the better of Joval 
and he silently slipped out of the 
bridge, down the corridor and out 
of the Ship into the bright orange 
light of Sun. He made his way to 
where his family sat prayerfully 
watching the Ship, watching the 
violet flickering that played across 
the subspace antenna on the Ship’s 
hull. 

“How does it go?” Amalthea 
asked as Joval sat down on the 
blanket in the shade of the lean-to. 

“Well enough,” Joval said. 
“Theo has not made a single mis- 
take so far. The gods should be 
pleased.” 

“Good,” his eldest wife said. 
“You must be hungry’” 

“I am.” 

She opened one of the packs, 
took out a wrapped slice of dried 
famlydog meat and a small pile of 
treshen seeds. She filled her gourd 
half full of water. 

Joval nodded his appreciation. 
“Do you think it may happen 
this time, Joval?” asked Filis, 



blushing and ill at ease, refusing to 
meet his eyes, apparently still 
thinking of the events of the night 
before. 

“It may,” Joval said, smiling at 
her and trying to tell her with his 
eyes that what she had done, what 
they had all done, was as it should 
have been, as the gods willed. “It is 
all going well,” he went on. “We 
may contact Earth this time’” 

He remembered his father’s hav- 
ing spoken the same words many 
years before and he suddenly had 
very little hope — very little hope at 
all. 

J OVAL drank his water and ate 
in silence, his mind wandering 
aimlessly. 

“Amalthea,” he said, once he 
had finished and had wiped his 
hands on the blanket upon which 
he sat, “where did you sleep last 
night?” 

“Nowhere,” Amalthea an- 
swered. “I slept not at all.‘‘ There 
was a teasing smile on her face. 

“You know what I mean,” Joval 
said, annoyed but knowing that he 
had no right io be. 

“A wife is not required to tell- her 
husband of the Night Before the 
Sending,” Amalthea told him. 

“Yes, I know,” Joval replied. 
“But you know with whom I was.” 
“Yes, everyone knows where you 
were,” Amalthea said. “Is Frid's 
yellow- haired wife as good at those 
games as the young men say she 
is?”

"That is none of ypur business!” 
”I know. I am just making a 
point.” 

“Very well.” Joval sighed. 
“Keep your secret.” And with that 
he lay down within the lean-to and 
almost immediately fell asleep. 

When he awoke Sun had 
vanished and what passed for night 
on this side of Thisda had come, a 
pearly gray night illuminated by 
the reflected light of Big Basta. 
Famlydogs roamed the Valley of 
the Ship and howled forlornly at 
the sky. 

Wrapping his blanket around 
himself for warmth since it would 
be very cold soon, Joval told his 
family that he would return for 
breakfast about the time of the. 
rising of Sun, then went back to the 
Ship. 

LONGER have pseudo- 
l^speed potential. Repeat, we 
no longer have pseudospeed po- 
tential. We are . ” 

Theo was repeating the words 
for the twentieth time when Joval 
resumed his place in the line on the 
bridge and looked again through 
the press of bodies at the glowing 
lights of the radio control panel. So 
it would go until tomorrow dawn, 
when the Sending would end and 
the Receiving would begin. 

So Joval stood and watched and 
unconsciously scratched at vermin 
that crawled out of his blanket and 
wondered and prayed and thought 
and waited. 



It was a good Sending. Pray it 
would be a true Receiving. 

J OVAL and most of the others 
slipped out of the Ship and had 
a quick breakfast as Sun rose 
above the horizon. Then, as 
quickly, they hurried back to the 
Ship^ so that they would be there 
when the Sending ended and the 
Receiving began. 

Moments after he had resumed 
his place on the bridge, Joval heard 
the Captain say: “It is time to end 
the Sending.” 

Theo concluded the ritual words 
and turned to old Robt Sona Dave, 
his twisted mouth smiling. He 
knew he had done well. 

“Cease transmission. Go into re- 
ceiving mode.” 

Glancing at the open Manual, 
Theo’s hands fell across the con- 
trols, snapping off the transmit- 
ter’s switches, then snapping on 
those of the receiver portion. 

Receiver from Standby to Oper- 
ation. Preselector adjusted. Band 
Mode. BFO. Subspace Demodu- 
lator. RF Demodulator. Audio 
Demodulator. All on, operating, 
adjusted. 

For a few moments there was 
stark and total silence on the 
bridge. Men held their breaths and 
waited. Then the loudspeaker of 
the receiver came to life, snapping, 
crackling and roaring the strange, 
angry whispering of the radio gods. 

“Maxium audio gain,” the Cap- 
tain said. 



28 



IF 




Theo adjusted a single control 
and the whispering roar became 
louder. 



M en had done all that they 
could do. Now it was the turn 
of the gods, but the gods did not 
choose to speak in the words of 
men — not at first, at least. 

Joval grew very tired. One night 
of drinking and love-making with 
demanding Melinda, a second 
night of Sending and very little 
sleep in between were beginning to 
tell. Joval was not as young as he 
had once been. His eyelids grew 
heavy; his feet and legs ached; 
again he was hungry and thirsty 
and the waste fluids of his body 
demanded discharge. But he did 
not leave the bridge. No man 
leaves the bridge during a 
Receiving. That is the most crucial 
time of ail. No chances are to be 
taken. 

Fatigue finally became too much 
for him. He leaned back against 
the nearest bulkhead and let his 
eyelids flutter shut. He began 
sinking into a soft, pleasant, yet 
oddly uncomfortable blackness. 

The subspace radio’s loud- 
speaker suddenly changed tone. 
The vague crackling whisper was 
drowned out by a strahge, unfamil- 
iar squeal that rose in pitch until 
it hurt Joval’s ears; then he could 
no longer hear it. Moments later 
came another sound — words, hu- 
man words! 

TIME OF THE RENDING 



"‘ . for delivery to . .on the 
. .of albuti with . 

The squeal returned. 

The gasps of startled men filled 
the bridge. 

“The gods — ’’ a dozen voices 
said. 

“Earth — ’’ said another dozen. 

“Wait!” ordered the Chief Ger- 
iat. “Be silent!’’ 

The loudspeaker whispered and 
squealed and spoke again: “ . 
items urgently needed . would 
suggest that . relay for 
Earth . .’’ 

The holy word! Earth. It was 
Earth. It was a true Receiving! 

“ . for immediate shipment 

The receiver squealed one final 
time, returned to the same monot- 
onous whisper. 

White-faced, obviously shaken, 
old Robt Sona Dave gathered the 
four other Geriats on the bridge 
and took them as far away from 
the subspace radio position as 
possible, where they conferred in 
whispers. Theo remained at his 
position, looking directly at the 
radio panel, something like 
triumph on his face. 

J OVAL, as did all the others on 
the bridge, shared that triumph, 
but only for a short time. Then 
questions and doubts began to 
creep into his mind. The words had 
been strange and garbled and 
broken, only half understandable, 
but he could not help but speculate 

29 




upon them. It must be Earth, he 
thought, or at least related to Earth 
since that holy name had been 
spoken. But . well, did it really 
sound as if the speaker were talking 
to them, to the men of Thisda? 
Were there not others among the 
distant starworlds? Had not the 
Ancients said so? And did they, 
these other men, not talk among 
themselves by means of subspace 
radio? Could it be, really, that they 
were just hearing fragments of such 
a conversation? Might it be just 
that? 

Joval, as much as any of the 
others, wanted to believe that this 
was a true Receiving, but it seemed 
to him that what had just taken 
place was not enough. Perhaps they 
would hear that voice again, and 
perhaps then it would truly be 
speaking to them. 

The Geriats stood at the far end 
of the bridge, talking in their low 
whispers and shaking their heads 
slowly. One by one they returned to 
the radio position. 

“Brothers,” said Robt Sona 
Dave, speaking above the 
whispering noise of the radio, 
“listen to me. What we have have 
just heard was, in truth, a 
manifestation of the gods. We have 
been witness to a miracle.” He 
paused. “But not our miracle.” 

There were moans and then 
stunned silence as the truth began 
to sink in. Joval knew that he was 
right. It was no Receiving. 

“Though none are alive who re- 



member it, this has happened 
before,” the Captain was saying. 
“The Book of the Old Men tells us 
of three such times that words have 
been heard like this. But they were 
not true Receivings. The words 
were not meant for us. We must 
wait. Perhaps, since the gods have 
shown their goodness, they 
shall—” 

Joval did not listen any longer. 
He wanted to weep, but all he could 
do was stare at the lights of the 
radio control panel and wait for the 
Receiving to be over. No one on 
Earth cared about them. The gods 
were capricious and malicious and 
a man who waited for a Receiving 
was a fool. 



D ay passed into night and night 
gradually moved toward 
morning. The radio’s loudspeaker 
whispered and chattered and 
roar^ and clicked, but it did not 
speak again in the words of men. 

Theo Sona Weyam peered ever - 
more intently at the dials and me- 
ters and lights of the panel before 
him, his hands beginning to twitch 
nervously. An awkward cough 
began in his throat and twice the 
youth at the end of the line was 
forced to go get him water. Dark 
rings formed under his eyes and his 
twisted mouth seemed to move 
without his realizing it. 

The Radioman’s time was 
running out. And he knew it. The 
gods had teased him, laughed at 



30 



IF 




him, and would ultimately punish 
him for attempting to Receive. So 
it had always been. 

Old Robt Sona Dave, leaning on 
his cane when he stood but more 
often sitting as the time drew by, 
showed some of the symptoms 
displayed by Theo, though there 
was nothing of personal fear in 
them. It was just another 
disappointment in a long life of 
disappointments. It was not likely 
that he would ever live to see an- 
other Sending. So be it. 

At last the Time of the Receiv- 
ing was over. 

Awkwardly coming to his feet, 
aided by two of the other Geriats 
and supported by his cane, he said, 
“Mr. Communications Officer, 
you — “ 

“No!” Theo Sona Weyam cried 
suddenly. “No, please, wait a while 
longer, just a—” 

“Mr. Communications Officer,” 
the Captain began again, “you may 
now turn off — ” 

Theo suddenly came to his feet 
and stood defensively before the 
radio. “Give me more time. We 
shall Receive. I swear it.” 

“You shall do as I say,” Robt 
Sona Dave said sternly. 

“Wait, for the sake of the gods, 
please — ” 

The Old Chief Geriat’s hand 
snapped out, the back of his 
knuckles struck across the scarred 
face of the Radioman. 

“Turn off the receiver,” he said 
slowly, his anger barely controlled. 



“The Time of the Receiving is 
over.” 

Slowly and painfully, like a man 
dying — as in a way he was — Theo 
Sona Weyam turned back to the 
subspace radio and slowly snapped 
one switch after another. The 
lights went dark. 

Torches were kindled and the 
procession was formed. One by 
one, led by the Captain, they filed 
out of the Ship, slowly, sadly. They 
had failed. 

VI 

T he beginning of the ceremony 
that marked the end of the 
Sending and Receiving took place 
before the tent of the Geriats, 
above the cold, dead ashes of fire 
and below the great fertility 
symbol. All the men and women 
who had come to the Sending drew 
close, forming a huge semicircle a- 
round the spot, knowing the inevit- 
able outcome and knowing, too, 
what would happen that day before 
the Devouring of Sun. 

The Captain announced in the 
words of ancient ritual, that Earth 
had not answered. Then he ordered 
Theo Sona Weyam to come before 
him. 

The Radioman had aged a doz- 
en years in the past hour. His eyes 
were blank and empty; his body 
was limp, his mouth twitched and 
his movements faltered as he

“You are no longer Radioman 
of the Ship,” Robt Sona Dave said. 
“Remove your uniform.” 

Theo nodded vaguely and began 
loosening the buttons of the 
uniform blouse. After a few 
awkward moments he stood naked 
before the others, no different from 
anyone else. He was no longer a 
demigod, but just a* man— a man 
who had failed in a contest with the 
gods and would have to pay the 
price of failure. “Theo Sona Wey- 
am of the Greatfamly Innman,” 
the Chief Geriat began slowly, 
“the gods have shown disapproval 
of you, have deemed you un- 
worthy bf being Radioman of the 
Ship. Have you anything to say 
for yourself?” 

Theo shook his head slowly, then 
finally managed, “No, sir.” After a 
few moments of awkward silence, 
he fought out the words: “The gods 
know, Robt, I tried. I tried.” 

“So be the will of the gods,” 
Robt said, ignoring him. “Return 
the Manuals.” 

Theo handed him the three tat- 
tered books. 

“Theo Sona Weyam, you have 



one final service to perform for the 
Ship,” the Chief Geriat said. 

ESPITE the heat Joval felt a 
cold wind blowing along his 
naked back and seeping in through 
the flesh to his bones. No, it 
couldn’t be that, he thought. Not 
Theo . 

“Yes, Geriat,” Theo said 
brokenly. 

“Though you have failed, you 
have at least earned the right to 
suggest for us your replacement. 
Name us a man, good and true.” 

For a few moments a chilled, 
frightened hush fell over the as- 
sembled men, the beginnings of 
which Joval had felt moments 
before. And Joval knew that he had 
a right to fear more than most, for 
he well knew that Theo Sona 
Weyam was no friend of his. 

Theo’s almost inanimate eyes 
slowly scanned the crowd, stopping 
on one man, then moving on to an- 
other, picking face after face, then 
rejecting each. At last the eyes 
came to Joval; they- stopped and 
peered deeply and long, bitter with 
hatred.

IF 





“I suggest Joval Sona Ramon, 
the Knifemaker, as the next 
Radioman,” Theo said slowly, 
something resembling life return- 
ing to his voice. 

The words were like the repeat- 
ed blows of a hammer, but there 
was nothing Joval could do to 
avoid them. This, too, was as it 
must be. 

The Geriats stepped back away 
from the assembly, huddled for a 
moment, glanced over their shoul- 
ders at Joval and scratched their 
bearded chins. 

Somewhere off in the distance a 
woman sobbed, loudly and bro- 
kenly. 

“Joval Sona Ramon of the 
Greatfamly Heath, called the 
Knifemaker,” the Chief Geriat said 
at last, returning to his place, “you 
have been suggested and approved. 
Come forward.” 

Fear and a growing red hatred 
for Theo Sona Weyam filled 
J oval’s breast, though there were 
no true thoughts in his mind. With 
great effort, he slowly walked to 
where the Geriats stood. 

“Accept your duty and these 



Manuals,” he heard the Captain 
say as if from a very long way off, 
as if in a dream. “Study them well. 
Four years hence you shall Send 
and, the gods willing. Receive.” 
Numbly, mechanically, Joval 
accepted the Manuals and fought 
to hold himselFerect. 

“Now, brothers, the gods pass 
judgment on Theo Sona Weyam,” 
Robt Sona Dave said, though Joval 
hardly heard the words. 

J OVAL stood with the others be- 
fore the Ship, and the thoughts 
in his mind were vague, random 
and incoherent. 

Masai had watched *his father 
with awe and fear, for now he was 
something more than just a man, 
something more than just his 
father. Filis had tried to speak, but 
had been unable; pained sobs had 
broken her words and she had 
covered her face and turned away. 

And Amalthea — she had tried to 
comfort him, until that something 
that was in her mind and on her 
face had gotten the better of her. 

“Joval, my husband,” she had 
said slowly, her voice husky, “I did

not know he hated you so. I 
thought he — he had forgotten it as 
you have. Joval, had I known . 
Forgive me for the Night Before 
the Sending. I did not know he 
hated you.” 

She had turned away, hiding her 
tears, and Joval, only half compre- 
hending, had turned to the Ship to 
watch what would happen there. 

Soon, he knew, the. pain would 
pass. He still had four years to live, 
to work, to study, to learn all that 
he could about the Sending and the 
Receiving and perhaps— just per- 
haps — he would be successful. He 
knew that there was an Earth. 
He had heard its name on the 
subspace radio. It was not a myth. 
It was real. Perhaps he could be the 
one. 

He glanced down at the books in 
his hands. One was the Operating 
Manual, and it was the most worn. 
In fact, the back was missing, as 
were a number of pages, though 
how many he could not tell. He 
looked at the last torn page, 
unconsciously reading the final 
lines: 

Since subspace energy is broad- 
cast in a very narrow beam — prop- 
agated as a beam of one meter in 
diameter and spreading no more 
than 3,6 X 10-9 kilometers per kil- 
ometer — proper orientation of the 
ships integral hull antenna is of 
supreme importance over large in- 
terstellar distances. Should the an- 
tenna not be properly aimed, it ,, , 



A nd there the lines ended. 

What more the Manual had 
said, Joval could not even guess, 
and perhaps it was not important. 
But he would learn as well as he 
could. 

Someone ages before — probably 
one of the Ancients with their mar- 
velous writing instruments — had 
scribbled a marginal note on the 
page, a scribble that Joval painfully 
deciphered. “The spread of the 
beam from UR-420-48-I-A to 
Earth should be no more than 374 
X 10-6 kilometers. By my figures 
the power received on the Lunar 
grid would be about .9 microran- 
dals. This should be sufficient for 
reception — if we could just get the 
damned thing oriented.” 

Joval shook his head with 
incomprehension. He would learn. 
He would have to learn. 

Then he looked up at the Ship 
and the small, distant form of Theo 
Sona Weyam who was now taking 
his place atop the Ship's hull. 
Carefully the ex-Radioman was 
moving to his assigned spot, the 
very center of the bright metallic 
strips of the antenna. 

The Geriats had already filed in- 
to the Ship, taking their positions 
for this one last ceremony before 
the beginning of the Trading. Now, 
Joval thought vaguely, the Engi- 
neer, old Grego Sona James would 
be feeding power to the bridge, and 
the Captain, Robt Sona Dave, 
would be seating himself before the 
radio. Now he would begin

flipping switches with the practiced 
ease of half a lifetime, building 
power, preparing to assist the gods 
in their judgment. 

The assembly began a prayer for 
the lost soul of Theo Sona Weyam, 
who had failed. 

What followed could not have 
lasted the hours it seemed, but only 
minutes. Theo took the position of 
prayer. A sparkle of violet light 
built up around him. The Final 
Sending began — brief seconds, but 
enough for the will of the gods. 

T he antenna glowed brightly. 

Theo jumped to his feet, 
screamed and flung his arms 
skyward as if asking help from the 
gods who had condemned him. His 
nakedness seemed to hang in space 
for a moment — then crumple, 
bursting into flames. His body was 



consumed in moments. 

Joval stood looking at the violet 
flickering that played across the 
antenna and rose into the sky. It 
was a thin, faint line that rose to- 
ward where Big Basta hung direct- 
ly above the Ship; the Man-in-the- 
Sky was now at the point of De- 
vouring Sun. 

The subspace waves moved away 
from Thisda toward the huge plan- 
et it circled — straight, true, direct 
— a meter-wide beam of energy 
that would end in the gaseous en- 
velope and the rocky core of the 
monster world above. 

And as Sun vanished and the sky 
began to grow dark with the De- 
vouring, Joval Sona Ramon, the 
Knifemaker, Radioman-elect, 
scratched at an insect bite and won- 
dered what was the significance of 
that. •

I 

A ll nine at the meeting were 
‘►identifiably in uniform. But a 
certain informality prevailed, 
peculiar to final briefings where 
everyone except the senior of- 
ficer — who was not going on the 
operation — knew he or she might 
not return. 

This briefing was also unlike 
others in that the eight who faced 
General Print were in a sense only 
two. 



The four men were identical to 
the tenth decimal place. Even in 
their casualness they were the 
same — all four had released the top 
two hooks of their tunics and all 
had thrown the left leg over the 
right knee. Tall and lean, each had 
close-cropped, prematurely gray- 
ing hair. They were an amalgam 
of many races, white, brown, red, 
yellow and black, the result be- 
ing, as often happened when races 
mingled, that they were at once 
striking and singularly handsome. 

The four girls were also identi- 
cal, but not to infinity. Their uni- 
forms were not quite uniform. One 
wore her tunic, two their under- 
blouses and the fourth a red sweat- 
er which looked like a gesture of 
defiance coupled with the green 
uniform trousers. 

General Print said, “This, of 
course, is a unique project. There 
has never been one like it and 
there will never be another. Unless 
your descendants — ’’ 

“If any,” one of the girls mur- 
mured, not loudly but audibly. 
The four men, as one, turned 
their heads to stare repressively at 
her. 

“We certainly hope there will be 
descendants,” said the general. 
“We are hoping that on your 
return the four women will be . .” 

He coughed awkwardly. Like 
many old soldiers. General Print 
could talk baldly and coldly of 
death, but was embarrassed by the 
processes of birth. He forced 




himself to go on. “The four women 
should — on return to Eden — be 
pregnant. What is your reaction?” 
The girl who had spoken before 
said, “You’re asking quite a lot. 
General. At this moment, we are 
all pure and unsullied.” 

The general would have replied 
seriously, but all four girls giggled. 

He said stiffly, “Am I to take 
it—” 

One of the other girls said,' 
“Nevertheless, the proposition 
does interest us. Imagine being 
ordered to be a bad “girl for the 
good of one’s race.” 

General Print said coldly, “I 
won’t make it an order. What must 
be agreed, however, is the matter of 
command. 

One of the men said, “Wil. It 
must be. He is the girls’ father.” 

A girl said, “We’ve no objection 
to Wil’s being in charge of his side 
of the operation, but we have to 
make the big decisions.” 

The general nodded. “No argu- 
ment about that. Wil and the other 
Directors can advise, but you girls 
must take every .major decision. 
The next thing to be decided is 
which of you will be the senior — ” 

A chorus of protest rose. One 
said, “It won’t work that way. One 
of us can’t be placed over the 
others.” 

General Print said doubtfully, 
“If you agree on that I suppose I 
must accept it. Now for the long 
view — total success would mean 
your return with the information 



we want and particularly with 
the . with the other item we 
want — and no casualties on either 
side. But I can’t give you deHnite 
orders. One of you, perhaps all of 
you, may have to kill. But kill only 
in absolute necessity.” 

After a long pause, he said 
again, “Absolute necessity. We are 
not at war. We don’t want to be at 
war.” 

Wil said, “General, my 
understanding is that it has always 
been our intention to — ” 

“On our own terms, in a chosen 
location, in our own time. Please 
be very clear on this. To have war 
forced on us as a result of this 
operation would mean failure. It 
might also mean disaster.” 

The general then felt it was ob- 
ligatory for him to make a final 
speech. “1 don’t suppose I’ll be 
alive when you come back,” he 
said. “I’ll never know if this 
operation will be Eden’s greatest 
triumph or greatest disaster. 
Perhaps none of you will know 
either — although disaster can be 
achieved in a very short time, 
triumph could take centuries. -One 
more thing I must tell you. Certain 
information about Eden and about 
yourselves has been denied you. It 
has been removed from your 
memories, because it is essential 
that the people you are going to 
meet should never learn it.” 

The four men and the four girls 
were regarding him with new inter- 
est. Several started to speak.

He held up his hand. “You must 
realize,” he said in gentle reproof, 
“that this was not done lightly. 
However, the circumstances you 
may encounter are unimaginable. 
It may become necessary for you 
to know this very thing which has 
been deliberately kept from you. 
It has therefore been placed as a 
locked memory in Pariss’s mind.” 
Three of the girls turned to look 
at the fourth as if they could read 
the secret in her face. Pariss her- 
self merely looked surprised. 

“If necessary,” said the general, 
his voice sinking, growing husky 
with fatigue, “the rest of you 
together or any one of you — or 
Pariss herself— will be able to 
break the seal. You can guess 
how.” He stood up and forced a 
smile. “That’s all. And if I may 
borrow a phrase from the people 
you will be moving among, good 
lucky 

F ort PLATO had never been 
attacked. The Terran Defense 
Commission, which had set it in 
space, armed and manned it, did 
not regard as very likely the 
eventuality that it ever would be. 
One of ten mammoth fortresses 
which orbited placidly billions of 
miles beyond Pluto (the similarity 
in name had caused confusion 
many times and would continue to 
do so), it was not as much a 
guardian of the Solar System as a 
warning. The Adamites were not 
fools. 



The Terran Defense Commis- 
sion relied quite cheerfully and 
confidently on one facet of Adam- 
ite philosophy and psychology — to 
the Adamites, defeat was death, 
although death was not necessarily 
defeat. Any Adamite attack had 
to be an Adamite victory or it 
would not be undertaken. Make 
an Adamite victory impossible 
and you prevented the attack. 

Adamites and Terrans were not 
precisely enemies. But they were 
not precisely friends either. 

Both claimed to be the original, 
the only genuine article, the “real 
people.” It was tacitly assumed 
that the human race could not 
evolve and had not evolved 
independently from scratch at 
opposite ends of the galaxy. There- 
fore, said the Terran group of col- 
onized worlds, far back in history 
we must have had an interstellar 
civilization which colonized Eden. 
Therefore, said the Adamites, in a 
time before our written history, we 
must have colonized Earth. 

Being emotional — or at the very 
least political— these claims ig- 
nored anthropology or twisted it 
to predetermined ends. Eden had a 
head start in that their main planet 
was actually called Eden.. Didn’t 
the Terrans themselves have 
legends of a Garden of Eden?

man in Earth’s history, Abraham 
Lincoln was called to his door by

small sons, who were both crying 
their eyes out. 

“What’s the matter with the 
boys, Mr. Lincoln?” the neighbor 
asked. 

“Just what’s the matter with the 
whole world,” replied Lincoln sad- 
ly. “I’ve got three walnuts and each 
wants two.” 

The galaxy was the three wal- 
nuts. And Earth and Eden each 
wanted two. 



T 'HE Fort Plato night checker 
saw the girl the moment she 
emerged on the green. His eye was 
drawn to the scanner frame by the 
movement of her vivid purple dress 
against the lush green of the grass. 
Since the windows of the check- 
point overlooked the green he left 
the scanners and went to the 
window. 

She was half running, half danc- 
ing. In the one-seventh Earth grav- 
ity her long full skirt whirled ec- 
statically about her. The checker, 
who was young, caught his breath. 
She was beautiful. 

Below the window was a dupli- 
cate set of alarm buttons. The 
checker’s finger sought one, found 
it and hovered over it. 

The girl in the purple dress 
kicked off her shoes, spun twice 
and sank gracefully to the grass, 
her long skirt settling slowly in k 
perfect circle about her. She was 
breaking no regulation and 
represented no danger whatever. 



save to the checker’s peace of 
mind. BU®it was the checker’s job 
to report and query anything out of 
the ordinary. 

After a moment he took his fin- 
ger away from the button. 

Ten days earlier, after the sensor 
reported a ship passing within five 
million kilometers and a visual 
scan showed that the ship was a 
war cruiser, he had given the 
alarm — not a red alarm, merely a 
blue. Nevertheless, even a blue 
alarm was a matter for General 
Morrison himself. The general had 
come to stand by silent and 
watchful, until it turned out that 
the cruiser, a TDC vessel, had duly 
reported herself to the checker on 
the previous shift. The general had 
erupted. 

He had been only a little unfair. 
Checker Alan Stewart, not having 
been told about the cruiser, had 
acted correctly. But Checker Alan 
Stewart should have been told 
about the cruiser — what, the 
general had asked, was the use of 
having a bloody checker if-he didn’t 
check, but simply panicked and 
stabbed every alarm button in sight 
the moment he saw any bloody 
thing? 

Checker Alan Stewart was sen- 
sitive. 

There remained, however^ some- 
thing a little strange about the girl, 
something he could not put his fin- 
ger on. 

Stewart went back to the scan- 
ners to take a closer look. 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



39 




I F HE wanted to he could spy on 
any of the five thousand men, 
women and children in Fort Plato 
imany of its fifty thousand rooms, 
offices, halls, cellars, bathrooms, 
corridors, stairways, armories or 
turrets. But no one of a peeping 
tom inclination had ever been 
made even a deputy relief assistant 
emergency checker, naturally. 

The checker was not a sentry. 
His function was rather that of a 
nightwatchman. Fort Plato, like 
most space stations, was run on a 
twelve-hour rather than a twenty- 
four-hour basis. The girl of course 
would be a night worker, a nurse or 
a technician seeking the deserted 
green for relaxation during a short 
break. 

Unwritten law prevented the 
checker from being a peeping tom. 
But a girl openly sunning herself on 
the green, under the direct view of 
the checkpoint windows, was as 
public as a noticeboard. 

On one of the scanners he 
brought her up to lifesize, half a 
meter from his face. 

She was even more beautiful 
close up than from a distance. 
Her beauty was exotic. Her cheeks 
were lean, her eyes gray and alert. 
Her eyebrows were thick and 
black and her dark hair, though 
neat, was quite short and not 
glamorous. 

The sunlight which bathed her 
had taken nine hours, twenty-five 
minutes and thirty-one seconds to 
reach her. It had had to be 



collected and focused on the green 
in order that she, far beyond the 
orbit of cold Pluto, could enjoy 
conditions similar to those on a 
sunny lawn on Earth. 

Above the green was the blue 
dome, scarcely distinguishable 
from a cloudless sky on Earth. In 
the center was what looked like the 
sun. 

It was time for a routine check. 
Sweeping the girl from the screen, 
Alan Stewart played a silent con- 
certo on his buttons. All was exact- 
ly as he expected. The sensor 
purred and clicked somnolently. 
Outside Fort Plato no human 
beings were within its range. 

He strolled back to the window. 
The girl was standing up, putting 
her hand to the side fastenings of 
her dress. She was going to take it 
off. Stewart’s temperature rose. 
She took it off. 

Stewart gulped. 

As she lay back oh the green, 
closing her eyes, he once again 
sensed the strangeness of her. His 
vague feelings never reached the 
point of uneasiness or suspicion. 
There had been a change of 
personnel when the supply ship 
called three weeks earlier. He took 
it for granted that she had arrived 
at that tim^. Her sunmini was 
anything but exotic. Indeed, in its 
precise minuteness it was 
thoroughly conventional. His 
imagination was running away 
with him. H^ reached out to sweep 
her from the screens. 



40 



IF 




Then he stopped. 

The girl had a scar on her abdo- 
men. It was a tiny scar, and would 
have been imperceptible but for the 
fact that she had turned to lie on 
her side and the light struck her 
obliquely. 

That was an appendectomy scar. 
Stewart had no doubt of it. He had 
formerly been a hospital orderly 
and had seen such scars on the 
bodies of old people. 

The operation was now obsolete. 
Surgery, at any rate surgery in the 
sense of cutting the body open and 
blundering about inside it, was no 
longer necessary in the treatment 
of appendicitis and nobody under 
the age of forty had ever had an 
appendectomy. 

This girl was obviously under the 
age of forty. 

In a flash of insight, belated but 
comprehensive, he put a score of 
things together and his finger 
stabbed at Key 1. The sirens, 
flashing lights, buzzers and bells of 
a red alarm were heard for the first 
time in Fort Plato. 

Less than five seconds later, the 
cacophony was shockingly aug- 
mented by the shrill whistle that 
meant the alarm was tod late — 
the fort had already fallen. 

The checker knew the girl was a 
decoy who had played a part in 
making pdssible the incredible fall 
of Fort Plato. 

And he was the criminal who 
had let a pretty girl divert him from 
his duty. 



II 

I T WAS blowing a full gale and a 
gale on the planet Outward 
made a gale on Earth seem like a 
mere climatic fit of temper. Earth 
gales did not suddenly cease or 
instantly explode into insane, 
murderous rages — Earth winds 
gusted, but conditions retained 
some semblance of consistency and 
could therefore be predicted up to a 
point. 

Gales on Outward were con- 
sistent only in being worse than 
expected most of the time, no 
matter how pessimistic the 
expectation! Fred Manvin was 
therefore about to close the gate of 
Camp Eleven and gratefully seek 
the comfort of his cellar, since 
there was no longer any possibility 
of traffic on the road from the 
west. Any mole that had missed the 
warnings would have turned off the 
road and dug in to wait out the 
weather. 

Then he stared. Clinging 
together desperately, two figures 
in white galesuits were coming 
along the road on foot. Their 
danger was considerable, although 
they were only some fifty meters 
from the gate. A gust might at any 
moment lift them and dash them to 
their deaths. 

As he peered through the flying 
dirt and dust, the wind somehow got 
a finger into one of the strangers’ 
tunics and tore it away in a split 
second. It flew high in the air and

disappeared. Galesuits were 
supposed to be proof against 
ripping, but in the Hnal analysis no- 
thing was proof against an 
Outward gale. 

Perhaps because of the fusillade 
of tiny fragments flaying his naked 
back, perhaps because of the 
sudden chill, the man lost his 
balance and was dashed to the 
ground. He was saved from being 
bowled along it only by the desper- 
ate clutch of his companion. 

The two were now only fifteen 
meters from the gate. The nearly 
.naked man tried to get up but could 
not. A leg and an arm seemed to be 
damaged. Vocally consigning the 
regulations to hell, Fred Manvin 
went out and dragged the two 
inside. One of them, he established 
in the course of his ungentle hand- 
ling, was a girl. 

He tripped the gate switch and 
hauled them . into the gatehouse, 
then down to the cellar. The man 
was bleeding from scores of small 
cuts caused by flying dust and tiny 
fragments. His left arm and his 
ankle were broken. 

The cellar was warm and starkly 
comfortable, though small. It was 
so well insulated that not a sound 
could be heard of the gale raging 
outside. 

Fred looked the man over first. 
He was forty or so, his dark hair 
graying at the temples. Naked to 
the waist, he was a fine figure of a 
man, powerful though slight. Blood 
streamed down his hairless body to 



his tight pants, but the many cuts 
were superficial and the arm 
fracture was a simple one which 
Fred, a general handyman, would 
have no difficulty in setting. The 
ankle was worse; there was a bone 
broken in the foot. Too, the man’s 
head had been smashed against the 
road and, although conscious when 
he reached the cellar, he slumped 
senseless when Fred lowered him 
into a chair. 

“Flare,” Fred said. “You do it.” 

The girl took off her goggles. 
“What’s that?” 

“Fire a flare,” said Fred, 
bending over the injured man. 

“Certainly, if you’ll tell me 
how.” 

“Go up the stairs again 
and — never mind. Sit down and 
don’t bother me.” 

Verne checked herself. She said 
coolly, “You fire the flare. I’ll 
look after my father.” 

Sal Slent was not, in fact, her 
father. He was her uncle. 

“You okay?” Fred asked. 

“I think so. Bruises, perhaps.” 
She took off her helmet and tunic 
and Fred noticed that she was 
beautiful. He was not interested. 
Fred’s wife was as massive as 
himself and skinny creatures like 
this girl seemed to him to belong to 
another race. 

“I’m Verne,” she said. “My 
father’s Sal Slent. I can look after 
him. I know what to do.” 

“I guess I’ll do this myself,” said 
Fred. “Water over there. Wash all

IF 




your dust off. You know what’ll 
happen if you don’t.” 

Verne, probably the most self- 
reliant of the four girls, was 
annoyed at being dismissed as 
useless. However, it might be 
dangerous to say anything; she 
might reveal ignorance of things 
she ought to know. 

She ran cold water from a tank 
into a plastic basin, found a bar of 
hard yellow soap and washed her 
face and /hands, wondering what 
the gatekeeper had meant when he 
had said. You know what'll happen 
if you don t . 

As her chill wore off she found 
out. 

The flying sand and dust had 
penetrated everywhere, into her 
hair, her galesuit and even her 
boots. She began to itch. She 
recalled references to “the itch” in 
radio messages their ship had 
picked up. The very soil was 
inimical to humans in this hostile 
world. 

F red was stripping Sal and 
cleansing his skin with tissues 
from a box. He’d be all right after 
ten days in bed, Fred said, though 
he’d hobble for a while longer. 
Finished at last, he put another 
chair under Sal’s feet and propped 
him against the table. 

“Sleeping now,” he said. “We’ll 
leave him in peace. Now I’ll try a 
flare, though it probably won’t do 
any good.” 

Verne wanted to ask about the 



absence of underground passages, 
of a phone, a radio,— or at least a 
flashing alarm beam on the roof. 
Obligingly, unasked, Fred gave 
her part of the answer. “We 
extended the boundary last week. 
Needed more space. Of course you 
have to build the fence first, then 
develop the ground inside. Now tell 
me — what were you doing out 
there?” 

“We weren’t out there for fun,” 
she said coldly. “Our mole toppled 
into a bog. We were lucky to get 
out.” 

“Oh, the marsh? I know it. But 
hell, it’s fifty meters off the road. 
You were crazy to drive fifty 
meters off the road.” 

“There was rock the mole 
couldn’t dig into.” 

“Sure as hell there’s rock, but 
it’s only a short stretch. You 
should have kept close to the 
road.” 

With visible restraint Verne said, 
“Thank you very much. Your 
advice comes a little late — but they 
say better late than never.” 

Fred frowned, trying to work 
that out. He decided it had been 
meant as a joke.and grinned. 
“Well, no harm done — except 
you’ll never see your mole again. 
The marshes on this hellish planet 
have never yet given back anything. 
Like some coffee?” 

“Yes, please.” 

After all, despite their ordeal, 
despite Sal’s injuries, despite her 
ignorance — which might have

made a keener observer than Fred 
Manvin suspicious — all had gone 
reasonably well so far. 

She/and Sal were in. Their part 
of the operation had started on a 
fairly successful note. Fred had 
told her himself that they would 
never see their mole again. It would 
not occur to him to doubt that the 
mole had ever existed. 



S TATION 692 (GP was one of 
several in Jupiter’s orbit, al- 
though far from the planet. At 
full efficiency, ships were capable 
of operating impudently within 
the mighty powerfield. Often, 
however, they were at much less 
than full efficiency and there had 
been many nasty accidents. The 
General Purposes stations in clear 
space were far more useful in an 
emergency than the stations on 
Jupiter’s moons. 

Hugh Suyang, the commander 
of Station 692, awoke to find his 
station no longer his. The last 
thing he could remember was going 
to bed in a normal and routine 
fashion. A certain tightness behind 
his eyes, a vague consciousness of 
the passage of considerable time, 
enabled him to guess that while 
asleep he had been drugged or 
gassed. 

When he opened his eyes in his 
tiny cabin, he saw a tall, lean man 
and a beautiful dark girl both in 
green uniforms which he did not 
recognize. 



“Pleased to meet you. Comman- 
der Suyang,’’ said the man courte- 
ously. “I am Director Far Slent 
and this is my daughter Pariss.’’ 

The circumstances of the Station 
692 operation were different from 
those of Fort Plato and the pioneer 
settlement on the planet Outward. 
Hugh Suyang grasped the 
essential fact at once. 

“You’re Adamites,” he breathed. 

Director Slent nodded. “But 
please don’t take precipitate 
action, Commander,” he said. “In 
fact, please don’t try to take action 
at all. The station is entirely in our 
hands. There are twenty-one of us 
and seven of you, giving us three to 
look after every one of you. You 
have all been disarmed, naturally, 
and we are all heavily armed. 
Appreciation of these facts — ” 

“Is it war?” Hugh asked 
bluntly. 

“No,” said Far. “It is not war. I 
do not think it will ever be war. 
Call it research.” 

Hugh would have liked to rise 
but he slept naked and the girl 
showed no sign of going. 

“I’ll be very pleased to call it 
research,” he said. “Pariss, do 
you mind handing me a glass of 
water? My mouth seems to be full 
of sand. Effects of the gas, no 
doubt.” 

He saw respect in the eyes of the 
girl, who was impressed by his way 
of taking the situation. 

“You could have killed me,” he 
said, sipping the water, “Tell me. 



44 



IF 




what chance do I have of reaching 
my three score and ten?” 

Their slight puzzlement in- 
dicated that the reference was 
unknown to them, which was not 
surprising since there had been 
comparatively little contact 
between Terrans and Adamites. 
Biblical references could not be 
expected to mean much to them. 
Yet they understood the sense. 

“A good chance,” the girl finally 
said, ”if you don’t try to be a 
hero.” 

Far Slent explained further, 
“We want the station to run 
normally. Possibly you or one of 
your six colleagues might, in the 
next few weeks, get out a message, 
a warning, an alarm. We must 
warn you — if that happens we will 
kill you all. Otherwise, when we go 
we shall leave you as we found 
you.” 

”You speak our language well.” 
Womanlike, the girl asked, 
“What did he say wrong?” 

Hugh smiled. “On the contrary, 
he was too correct. ‘We shall leave 
you — ’ We don’t louse up our 
syntax with too much grammar.” 

“I think I like you,” said the girl. 
“Fine, may I have my station 
back?” 

“Adamite humor,” said Far pen- 
sively, “is not quite the same as 
Terran humor. That is one of the 
things we must study.” 

“If you won’t give me my station 
back — is it too much to ask how 
you took it away?” 



“I will tell you this because it 
may make you a little more 
careful, a little less impulsive. 
First, your entire detection system 
is useless against our ships.” 

“That 1 could have guessed,” 
Hugh murmured. 

“Setond, we did, as you 
assumed, use gas to knock all of 
you out. We have a gas that is 
odorless and quick-aqting. You 
can’t expect me to tell you more 
than that.” 

No, thought Hugh. They would 
hardly tell him what new, special, 
secret weapon they had in reserve. 
Saying the station had been taken 
over by the use of gas was like 
giving cause of death as want of 
breath. What really mattered was 
left unexplained. 

“Third,” said Far Slent, “what 
has happened here is part of a four- 
pronged operation. There are three 
other independent parts.” 

“I see,” said Hugh, not seeing at 
all. 

“I’m telling you this because if 
the alarm were given here,” Far 
went on, “the three other echelons 
might be prejudiced. And what is 
essentially a peaceful operation 
might flare into violence and 
bloodshed. It could even start a 
Terran-Adamite war. And the re- 
sponsibility would be yours.” 

Hugh laughed. “Someone once 
said, ‘This animal is wicked. It 
defends itself when attacked.’ I’d 
better warn you. Director Far 
Slent — and you, Pariss — we’re 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



45 




liable to be wicked like that.” 

Far was going to say so/nething, 
but when Pariss gestured quickly 
he remained silent. 

Hugh was interested. Could it be 
that the girl was the boss? 

M unch EN was the latest of 
many cities on Earth to have 
the dubious distinction of housing 
the UN headquarters. Geograph- 
ically it had a better claim than 
most. It was within easy reach of 
all European and African mem- 
bers. The mighty American and 
Eastern powers had to come half- 
way, symbolically rather than 
physically, to meet here. 

The man and the girl who called 
at the vast Personnet Building, near 
the Hofgarten, were surprised and 
a little uneasy at finding 
themselves rapidly shuffled from 
one official to another, each of a 
little more consequence than the 
last and each more shrewd and 
penetrating. 

What sobered them most was the 
fact that they, unlike the other 
three pairs, had a specific job to do, 
the most important of the whole 
operation. If the organization of 
the Personnel Building were 
throughout as efficient as it 
appeared, they might find it 
difficult or even impossible to steal 
what they wanted. 

The last official to see them was 
a woman. They did not have to 
repeat their story. She already had 
the details before her. 

46 



“I’m Miss Heilbron,” she said. 
“You are Don Slent and daughter 
Gilen, natives’ of Maribis. Miss 
Slent, would you kindly walk about 
the room for a few moments?” 

Gilen did as she was told, careful 
to copy the slight sliding movement 
of Maribisan women, cautious but 
not ungraceful. Her cheap Terran 
clothes — black jeans and a lace 
shirt — were newly bought. They 
did not suit her. Her hips were too 
wide for pants and her breasts too 
emphatic for the see-through lace. 
The poor choice was deliberate — 
she and Don were supposed to 
look like country cousins. 

I should have thought,” said 
Miss Heilbron, “you were Adam- 
ites.” 

“We have more contact with the 
Adamites than any other Terran 
colony has,” said Don. 

“I am aware of that. But your 
daughter gives me the impression 
of an Adamite acting like a 
Maribisan rather than the other 
way around.” 

Gilen tried desperately to calm 
herself. The strenuousness of her 
effort defeated its objective. She 
was, she knew, the most highly 
strung of the girls, the least self- 
reliant. It seemed sheer madness 
at that moment that she rather 
than Verne or Tomi had been 
chosen for this most vital part of 
the operation. “I’ve seen Adamite 
women only twice,” she said. 
“They were in uniform. They’re 
smaller than we on average. They 

IF^ 




age prematurely.” Recklessly, 
because this woman had to be di- 
verted somehow, she went on: “If 
you. Miss Heilbron, were an 
Adamite you’d be quite old.” 

Miss Heilbron was a woman 
after all and the statement did not 
please her. She was sixtyish, 
attractive and in the prime of life. 
She might not show a sign of age 
for another thirty years. 

“Do feel free to be perfectly 
frank,” she said. “It makes a 
pleasant change from the tact of 
people who don’t live on the 
frontiers. You, Mr. Slent, are 
going gray. Adamites might do 
that at an early age, perhaps?” 

The situation was not improving. 
“Yes,” said Don readily. “You 
must remember that Terran life 
expectancy rose significantly only 
recently. The Adamites don’t 
appear to have achieved this 
advance as yet.” 

“Interesting,” said Miss 
Heilbron. “We’ll come back to it. 
Meantime, you seek employment 
here as experts on Maribis. Why?” 
They had a ready answer. Don 
said ruefully, “We are not clever 
people, I suppose. A small piece of 
good fortune at home enabled me 
to bring my daughter to see the 
Mother World. I underestimated 
expenses. We have dipped into the 
money which was to provide our 
return fare and must take jobs to 
make up the balance.” 

“You propose, I see, to work 
only for a month or so. Maribis has 



few dealings with UN, you know.” 
Don knew this very well. Their 
cover had been chosen because the 
Adamites’ pooled knowledge of 
Maribis was greater than that of 
any other Terran settlement, and 
because the chances were remote of 
their meeting a Maribisan native 
in a short time on Earth. 

“We require a medical examina- 
tion, of course,” Miss Heilbron 
said casually. 

Gilen merely nodded. • 

“You don’t mind? Either of 
you?” 

“No, why?” said Don. Gilen ad- 
mired his careless unconcern and 
wished once again that one of her 
sisters had been entrusted with 
Miinchen. 

Miss Heilbron changed the 
subject briskly. “Yes, I think we 
can employ you both. Not, 
however, in the capacity you 
suggest. It is unlikely that the next 
few weeks will bring any need for 
the services of a Maribisan expert. 
But you obviously know a certain 
amount about the Adamites. Such 
information is rare.” 

She made a note on a pad. “We 
shall engage you to tell us every 
least little thing you know about 
the Adamites.” 



Ill 

T he first thing to be attended to 
now that Fort Plato was in 
Adamite hands, Wil Slent’s legal 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



47 




officer told him, was the execution 
of Checker Alan Stewart. 

“This will show decisively,” said 
Arol, the legal officer, “that we are 
in control, that we are just, that we 
are impartial. No one act better 
fulfills the requirements than the 
execution of the one man directly 
responsible for the fall of this 
Terran fort. If we wait until 
another Terran can be executed as 
an example, his crime will almost 
certainly^ be against us and our 
impartiality will be in doubt. If we 
execute Alan Stewart, whose crime 
is against them, our stand will be 
clear at once.” 

“Yes,” Wil replied. “But I must 
consult Tomi.” 

“Not in this matter,” Arol said. 
“She is in some way involved. I 
suggest you make the decision 
yourself. Director.” 

Wil pondered for a moment. 
Arol, a young and ambitious 
officer, was taking too much on 
himself He was too positive, too 
insistent. 

The trouble was, Arol was right. 

When General Morrison was of- 
ficially informed he said apoplec- 
tically, ‘"You want to execute him? 
I’d have thought you’d want to give 
him a medal.” 

“Your observation. General,” 
said Director Wil Slent, “reveals a 
certain misapprehension about 
Adamite justice. Whether Stew- 
art’s crime is against you or us, it 
remains a crime which must be 
punished immediately.” 



“Without a trial?” 

“Do you think a trial is neces- 
sary?” 

“Most certainly.” 

“Then there must be a trial. I 
have met your legal officer. He 
seems a most reasonable man.” 
“Yes,” the general agreed 
expressionlessly. “Most reason- 
able. There is one small point — ” 
“Yes?” 

“He’s Alan Stewart’s brother.” 
Wil shrugged. “That might pose 
a difficulty if it were his duty to 
prosecute. But he will defend Alan 
Stewart. Have you any objec- 
tion?” 

“No.” 

“Neither have we.” 

The trial took place in the coun- 
cil chamber. It followed Adamite 
form rather than Terran, but as 
Advocate John Stewart told the 
general after consultation with 
Adamite legal officers, the form 
seemed not unfair and would 
certainly be quicker than a Terran 
trial. The only large difference 
would be the absence of the 
accused during much of the 
proceedings. 

The jury consisted of four Ter- 
rans and four Adamites. Wil Slent 
presided because control of the fort 
was in Adamite and not Terran 
hands. 

An Adamite officer spoke first, 
using his own tongue. Wil, who 
spoke English perfectly, translated 
the brief statement. 

“We were able, by means which 



48 



IF 




1 shall not disclose unless they 
prove to be relevant to the matters 
before this court, to take over this 
fort with no casualties on either 
side. The one alarm we were unable 
to put out of action was the Terran 
checker. He had to be diverted for 
a few minutes. The task fell to Spe- 
cial Officer Tomi Slent.” 

Wil was immediately replaced by 
Tomi, who wore the green uniform 
of an officer of the Adamite Navy. 

She spoke in pure Terran. “It 
was impossible to reach the 
checker physically, but it was a 
simple matter for me to reach the 
green outside the checkpoint. The 
plan was — “ 

Here a Terran member of the ju- 
ry exploded, asking what kind of 
trial this was supposed to be. Were 
they to hear only an Adamite- 
censored version of what had 
happened? 

John Stewart replied to the ob- 
jection: “What you are hearing is 
stipulated evidence. As defense 
counsel I’ve agreed that only this 
summary of the relevant facts will 
be given.’’ 

The juror grumbled but sat 
down. “I hope you know what 
you’re doing, that’s all.’’ 

John Stewart was neither popu- 
lar nor unpopular. No one knew 
him very well. However, a man de- 
fending his brother against an ali- 
en race and a death penalty must 
surely be doing his best to get his 
client off. 

Tomi went on: “The plan was to 



attract and hold the checker’s at- 
tention so that he could not^make 
any visual sweeps of the fort.” 

Here Arol, the Adamite prose- 
cutor, stopped her. “You used the 
word ‘random.’ Why?” 

“Because only random survey 
could show up the infiltration tak- 
ing place. The success of the oper- 
ation shows that all the fort’s auto- 
matic alarms were successfully nul- 
lified. What could not be nullified 
— what had to be diverted — was 
the curiosity of the one man in the 
fort who could see what was going 
on in any part of it.” 

Arol turned to the jury. “The 
significance of this is that the 
checker in this fort is the human 
supervisor of a complex of 
machines. The machines failed.^ 
Neither they nor their designers are 
on trial. But the checker, placed 
over them as a final safeguard, 
also failed, and this — ” 

“I did not stipulate that,” said 
Stewart sharply. 

The Adamite was honestly puz- 
zled. “It is an undisputed fact that 
he failed.” 

“It is not.” 

“On what point, precisely, are 
you challenging my statement?” 

“I am challenging your right to 
make any statement at all. You are 
telling the jury as fact things which 
have not been stipulated.” 

Wil intervened hastily. However, 
Stewart did not press the challenge, 
apparently satisfied with a warning 
to Arol. 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



49 




Tomi went on. “It was known 
that Uie checker at the time was 
alone, young, male. What I had to 
do was keep him occupied without 
arousing his suspicions. I — “ 

“Please repeat the last 

sentence,” said Stewart. 

A little surprised, Tomi said, 
“What I had to do was keep him 
occupied without arousing his 
suspicions.” 

“Without arousing his 

suspicions?” 

“Yes.” 

Stewart turned to Director Wil 
Slent. He said, “Surely if this girl 
succeeded in her aims — and it has 
been stipulated that she did — she 
did not arouse the checker’s suspi- 
cions. Therefore, where was the 
jeasonjor him to give the alarm?” 

Everybody tried to talk at once 
and Wil had to order silence. 

Once again, instead of following 
through, Stewart stepped in 
smoothly the moment quiet was 
restored and said to Tomi, “Thank 
you. I have no more questions.” 

It was now defense’s right to call 
a witness. The first called was Alan 
Stewart. 

Alan Stewart was worried and it 
showed. He himself fully believed 
he was guilty and his brother had 
not been able to convince him 
otherwise. The fort had been taken 
over without a fight by four 
hundred men and women from an 
Adamite ship. He should have 
stopped them. 

John Stewart unwrapped a pep- 



permint and put it into his mouth. 
“When you saw the girl,” he asked, 
“what did you do?” 

“Went to the window and 
looked at her.” 

“Why did you not give the 
alarm?” 

“She was breaking no 
regulation.” 

“Yet you finally gave the 
alarm?” 

“Yes.” 

“Too late — and only foiir point- 
three-one-six seconds before the in- 
vading force gave it themselves by 
breaking cover?” 

“I don’t know the exact time 
lapse. About that.” 

“Exactly. that. The figure is stip- 
ualted.” 

Stewart turned to the jury. “The 
checker did give the alarm. That’s 
stipulated. The defense’s case is 
complete.” 

He sat down. 

If there had been babble before, 
this time there was uproar. 

When Arol took the floor his 
voice quivered with suppressed an- 
ger. 

He said, “This is some kind of 
Terran legal trick. We knew all 
along that the checker gave the 
alarm eventually, too late. What is 
in question is why he didn’t give it 
before.” 

Stewart rose. “Oh, that’s what’s 
in question, is it?” he asked. “We 
can soon settle that. Stewart, why 
didn’t you give the alarm before?” 

“Because it was only then that I 



50 



IF 




knew something was wrong. The 
girl had an appendix scar.” 
Questioned by his brother, he ex- 
plained. The Adamites were inter- 
ested. This was something they 
simply hadn't known about. 

“So,” said Stewart smoothly, 
“you waited until you were sure, 
then gave the alarm. You were not 
suspicious about the girl but you 
kept her under observation until fi- 
nally you knew she was not Terran. 
Then you gave the alarm.” 

“That’s right.” 

Stewart sat down again, a casu- 
al wave repeating what he had said 
before — as far as he was con- 
cerned, the case was over. 

Wil did nothing for several sec- 
onds. But he had to go on with the 
case. “Counsel, if it is your con- 
tention that it was not in Stewart’s 
orders to give any alarm until he 
was quite certain a state of emer- 
gency existed, you must bring this 
out.” 

“I see. Stewart, when the girl 
first appeared, you didn’t give the 
alarm because she was breaking 
no regulation.” 

“That’s right.” 

“Who told you not to give any 
alarm until you were perfectly sure, 
absolutely sure?” 

“General Morrison.” 

Stewart let the pause drag out. 

At least he said, “You acted as 
you did in accordance with the or- 
ders of General Morrison?” 

Alan had enough sense to say 
merely, “Yes.” 



“So if the fort fell when you 
might have prevented it — it fell 
because you were obeying the 
orders of General Morrison?” 

“Yes.” 

Stewart turned to Wil. 
“Obviously the wrong man has 
been charged. You must charge 
General Morrison. And I’ll defend 
him.” 

Wil wanted to consult Arol, but 
he could not, in the course of a 
trial, speak privately to the 
prosecutor without the defender’s 
being present. 

He turned to the jury. “As pres- 
ident of this court,” he said, “I feel 
it my duty to instruct you to return 
a verdict of not guilty.” 

W HEN Wil and Arol were 
alone Arol said, “That man 
Stewart is a clever lawyer. This 
could be a bid for personal 
advancement. He may mean to put 
his general on trial and get him off 
but discredit him.” 

“All his stipulation led us on,” 
the Director mused. “He was quite 
prepared to have us put his brother 
on trial. We assumed' that the 
checker’s duties included those of 
sentry and he encouraged us to 
assume this. The result was that the 
trial has turned out to the Terrans’ 
advantage. And we can safely 
assume that if General Morrison 
were put on trial, the result would 
be similar.” 

^‘Can we? I would be on my 
guard with Stewart this time. He 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



51 




would not catch me sleeping 
again.” 

“Napping,” said Wil absently. 

“Pardon?” 

“They say, ‘You won’t catch me 
napping.’ ” Wil looked at Arol cu- 
riously. He had thought the man a 
pushing but competent officer. In 
his dealings with the Terrans, how- 
ever, he seemed lacking in imagin-. 
ation. 

Wil thought he knew why Stew- 
art had suggested putting General 
Morrison on trial. 

‘‘Suppose this time Stewart stip- 
ulates nothing. Suppose he brings 
the whole operation into evidence. 
Won’t we have to answer all his 
questions?” 

Arol began to see. “If he did 
that — yes, by our own law we’d 
have to tell all the details. Your 
* mind probe. How you and Tomi 
induced technicians in moments of 
inattention to switch off certain 
relays when they thought they were 
adjusting them. Our auxiliary non- 
electric drive which their sensors 
can’t detect — of course if they 
could conceive of a ship using no 
. electricity' and with all batteries 
flat, they could design special 
sensors to detect such a ship. Yes, 
we’d have to answer all such 
questions. You can’t try a fort 
commander for failure without 
full evidence of what he was up 
against.” 

Wil nodded. “So we must drop 
the whole thing.” 

Reluctantly Arol agreed. 



Wil frowned. “We have made a 
bad beginning. We should have 
thought longer and more deeply.” 

“You’re admitting failure, sir?” 

“Not at all. We must learn about 
the Terrans. They have a saying 
that one learns by one’s mistakes.” 

“An exceedingly dangerous doc- 
trine.” 

‘‘Yet perhaps it holds a grain of 
truth.” 

Everything in Fort Plato was 
open to him, Wil was thinking — 
the library, the logs, the records, 
the reports, the microfilm. Before 
he took any sort of action again 
he was going to learn a great deal 
from the library and the records. 
Nothing could be more urgent and 
essential. 

Of course the Terran books and 
records would be copied and the 
copies would be taken back in the 
ship. But what he could learn on 
the spot personally was a hundred 
times more valuable than what he 
took back on film. On the spot he 
could query anything that baffled 
him, investigate and clarify what he 
did not understand. 

Arol said, “If you let me have 
another opportunity, sir, I shall 
show you and the Terrans that I 
learn a great deal from my— ex- 
perience.” 

Wil liodded again in Terran 
fashion, but he was not convinced. 
He wanted no more courtroom 
battles in Fort Plato, not when his 
own weapon, Arol, was obviously 
inferior to the Terrans’ Stewart.

He wanted nothing at all to 
happen until he had learned from 
the Terrans. 

IV 

C ontact was made immedi- 
ately after Arol left Director 
Wil Slent and sent Tomi in. This 
was two hours after Sal and Verne 
were dragged through the gate on 
the planet Outward, four hours af- 
ter Far and Pariss took control of 
Station 692 (GP), six hours after 
Don and Gilen arrived in Miinch- 
en. The synchronization was very 
good, all things considered. 

In Fort Plato and Station 692 it 
was easy for the Adamite pair to 
concentrate. In each station 
Director Slent was in full and open 
command and could lock himself 
in a private room with the girl, Wil 
with his daughter Tomi and Far 
with his niece Pariss. 

In Miinchen the situation was 
more difficult, for Don and Gilen 
at the time were filling in forms in 
the Personnel Building and had to 
go on doing so while the contact 
occurred. 

The cellar on Outward presented 
most difficulties, not because Fred 
Marvin insisted on talking — he was 
making supper — but because Sal 
Slent had just regained conscious- 
ness and had a mild concussion. 

The eight did not know exactly 
what they were doing, any more 
than the savages who invented 
speech knew the mechanism of the 



vocal cords and the larynx. Tomi 
called soundlessly, thinking of 
Verne, Pariss, Gilen, visualizing 
them, hearing their voices, trying 
to guess how they felt, how they 
were dressed. More vaguely, con- 
scious of effort and purpose but 
little else, Wil, Sal, Far and Don 
did what they could to help. 

Telepathy, among Terrans and 
Adamites alike, was a rogue talent. 
That mind could touch mind in cer- 
tain unpredictable circumstances 
had not been doubted for centuries 
by anyone prepared to believe the 
evidence. Most of the evidence, 
however, consisted of random, 
uncoordinated flashes, too uncon- 
trolled for study. 

The only people who ever 
seemed to get anything regularly 
and on significant occasions were 
identical twins. 

The birth of the Slent 
quadruplets Wil, Sal, Far and Don 
had barely affected matters at first. 
Like twins and triplets of many 
races, each knew when the others 
were in danger, each sensed it 
when the others were injured. They 
had joined the Adamite Navy on 
the same day. The Navy had not 
considered their peculiar link 
sufficiently valuable for particualr 
notice. 

But when the Caron crashed on a 
barren, unnamed world the unex- 
plained, unexplainable knowledge 
of three brothers led to the rescue of 
the fourth and most of the crew. 
After that the Navy noticed. 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



53 




The Slent brothers married 
similar girls at about the same 
time. All four wives proved 
infertile at first. The wife of Wil 
Slent had borne quadruplet girls 
finally, after taking fertility 
treatments. The girls were named 
Tomi, Verne, Pariss and Gilen. 
There were no other children. 

The girls followed the classic 
pattern. They dressed alike, shared 
boy friends; they took mischievous, 
sometimes cruel delight in substi- 
tuting for each other. Partly be- 
cause their own link was so strong, 
partly because no young man ever 
isolated and identified any one of 
them for long enough and with suf- 
ficient certainty to make her fall in 
love, they remained huntresses. 

When they were seventeen Pariss 
fell a victim to appendicitis. Within 
a week all the girls had to have the 
same operation. And about that 
time Wil Slent was embarrassed to 
find himself occasionally seeing 
into his daughters’ minds. 

He told his brothers and experi- 
ments were conducted. The Navy 
eventually found out. Being a 
Navy, it naturally considered any- 
thing new and startling in the light 
of a weapon. The question was, 
what to do with the Slents’ talent. 

Train it first, obviously. Under 
naval psychologists the Slents 
found they could work in pairs, one 
of the girls trying to reach one of 
her sisters and usually failing until 
her father or uncle reinforced the 
effort. Then a new bond was 



created — like a double wire in an 
electrical circuit, two Slents could 
achieve a special kind of linkage 
with two more. Each unit had to be 
one of the girls and one of the 
men, just as electrical contacts 
had to be positive and negative. 

Having discovered a weapon, the 
Adamite Navy had to use it. And 
the biggest military challenge in the 
galaxy was the uneasy presence of 
two independent branches of the 
human race. 



G radually the contact 
strengthened. The other girls 
knew that Verne was huddled in 
towels, felt the pain of Sal’s arm 
and foot and head, saw Gilen writ- 
ing in a bare, bright office, sensed 
the claustrophobic remoteness of 
life in a space station. Every de- 
tail reinforced the link. Then 
something like a conversation 
started. 

GILEN — Don— Munch- 
en — bright office: Success- 
ful so far but danger . 
Terrans suspect we are Ada- 
mites . medical examina- 
tion . 

TOMI— Vs/\\— Fort Pla- 
to — closed in: Avoid this 
. (Details of appendix- 
scar betrayal). 

GILEN: Possibly not ser- 
ious. Maribis contact with 
Earth incomplete . Such 
surgery likely, or at least

still possible, on Maribis. 

TOMI: Then others . 
take care. 

PARISS — Far — Station 
692 — closed in: Unimpor- 
tant here. Terrans know we 
are Adamites. 

VERNE — Sal — Outward 
— warm cellar: Warning 

useful ... if necessary, scar 
can be explained. Not ap- 
pendix . scar left by acci- 
dent with knife. 

TOMI: Terrans cunning 
. some cleverer than we. 

GILEN: Must not be un- 
derestimated . 

PARISS: Interesting . 

VERNE: No great effi- 
ciency here . , 

T he flow was rapid and often 
inconsequential, like four rivu- 
lets running into a pool. In the 
depths fish darted — the other three 
sisters did not miss the evasive, 
mischievous excitement of Pariss, 
but whatever it meant it was not a 
thing for the father and uncles and 
they pretended to miss it. Each 
also sensed Gilen’s fear as another 
thing not to be brought into the 
light. 

In this first contact there was not 
much to say. They concentrated 
rather on establishing a good link, 
a link which would be easier to 
form next time because each knew 
a little about the new circum- 
stances of the others. 

In an emergency the link might 



mean the difference between life 
and death. 



M ISS HEILBRON sat 

thoughtfully at her desk. Fi- 
nally she flicked an intercom 
switch. 

“Tell Dr. Roger Miller to come 
and see me at once.” 

Miller strode in five minutes lat- 
er. He said icily, “I have not yet 
been officially informed. Miss 
Heilbron, of your promotion to 
Director-general. Frankly, if my 
opinion had been asked, I should 
have said the interests of Personnel 
might have been better served by a 
move in the other direction.” He 
paused. Miss Heilbron waited and 
smiled politely. At last he asked 
“In one word. Miss Heilbron, to 
what do I owe this dishonor?” 
“Adamites,” she said. 

“Adamites here? In this build- 
ing?” 

“More precisely — in this office, 
very recently. You’ve never met an 
Adamite, Dr. Miller, have you? 
You’re supposed to be an expert on 
Eden, yet you’ve never met an 
Xdamite?” 

He sat down. “My time is valu- 
able,” he said. “What is this cock- 
and-bull story?” 

She told him about her visitors 
and how she had handled them. 
When she mentioned she had said 
to them: “I should have thought 
you were Adamites — ” he sat bolt 
upright. 



IF 



55 




“You accused them to their 
faces?” 

“Until then,” she said mildly, “I 
wasn’t quite sure I was right.” 

“But how can you possibly be sure 
now that you are right?” 

She sighed. “I could never con- 
vince you, Dr. Miller, and I don’t 
propose to try. I’m giving you an 
opportunity to convince yourself by 
studying these so-called Maribi- 
sans. Not personally. I don’t want 
you to meet them.” 

“You don’t want me to meet 
them? What madness — ” 

“Exactly, Dr. Miller — what 
madness it would be to allow you 
to meet them. You have never 
learned self-control and I’m afraid 
it’s too late now.” 

Miller realized that for him to 
storm out of the room in a temper 
would confirm her words. He man- 
aged to maintain his icy front, even 
to smirk sardonically. 

“What do you suggest? I am 
completely in your hands. Miss 
Heilbron.” 

“1 suggest you give me your 
promise not to contact these two 
personally — and having done that, 
take over the entire matter.” 

There was a long pause. 

Miller was of the same genera- 
tion as Miss Heilbron, a tall hand- 
some man in his prime. He had 
been married seven times and had 
given up matrimony for good; that 
it could not work was the fault not 
of seven women but of the whole 
female sex. He was a lonely man 



because there were fe^ minutes of 
his day during which he was not 
angry, not lashing out at anything 
and anybody within reach. 

Yet he was high in the hierarchy 
because any job he was given and 
genuinely accepted was done 
exhaustively, brilliantly. 

“Very well,” he said mildly. 
“You’re wrong, of course. Miss 
Heilbron. These people may not be 
Maribisans, but neither will they 
turn out to be Adamites.” 

She merely smiled and said, 
“Prove it. Dr. Miller.” 

G ILEN and Don found accom- 
modation a great problem. At 
first they refused Personnel’s offer 
of assistance. But all hotel rooms 
were taken or too ruinously expen- 
sive — they were supposed to be 
short of money. Miinchen, like 
many other administration centers, 
was bursting at the seams. 

After walking for hours Gilen 
said to her uncle, “If only we could 
feren — ” 

“Well, we can’t,” he said calmly. 
“I know, but it would be so 
easy — ” 

“Gilen, the one thing we firmly 
agreed on before we started was 
that we would never, after we were 
established, take chances by 
meddling with Terran minds.” 

“I know, but—” 

“If anything happens anywhere 
to give the Terrans a clue, they’ll 
work out the rest. In the two space 
stations, two or three or twenty

technicians were touched gently 
and caused to turn a switch one 
way when they thought they were 
turning it the other. The action 
was necessary and relatively safe. 
When a man does a routine job he’s 
not thinking — he doesn’t have to 
think. His mind is elsewhere. But 
we have no need of extreme 
measures now.” 

“I know—” 

“You dont know, Gilen, or you 
wouldn’t be proposing anything so 
foolish at this stage.” 

Gilen was hot, footsore and 
weary. She was conscious of being 
the weak sister. Opposition 
strengthened Verne, made Pariss 
laugh, excited Tomi, but bore her 
down and trampled on her. Having 
no place to sleep that night in a 
strange city was a small matter— if 
they failed to find accommodation 
Personnel would help them, she 
knew. But it got her down. 

She sighed. “Then let’s go back 
to Personnel.” 

They returned and were given a 
list of addresses. Five times they 
drew a blank, but at the sixth house 
they found two comfortable rooms 
and a bathroom. Gilen cheered up 
at once. She was the most mer- 
curial of the girls. Now perfectly 
contented, she locked, her door 
against the Terrans, her uncle, ev- 
erybody, kicked off her shoes and 
lay back on the bed luxuriously. 

Personnel was pleased, too. The 
visitors had been placed exactly 
where Personnel wanted them. 




self out. 

“You stay with your old man,” 
Fred told Verne. “I’ll get a 
stretcher party.” 

He was back in ten minutes with 
two other men, both burly, but slim 
striplings beside himself. One of 
them looked at Verne, who was 
draped in towels, with greater 
interest than at the patient he had 
come to collect. 

“Verne Slent— Red Conrad,’’ 
said Fred. “Here.” He threw her a 
pair of Jeans, a shirt and sneakers. 
Then the three men turned to Sal, 
who was feverish and only partly 
conscious. They wrapped him in 
blankets. 

While they took him upstairs 
Verne put on the alien clothes. 
Soon Fred returned. He was alone. 
He waved casually at her as she 
made for the stairs. “Be seeing 
you,” he said, but he was wrong. 

A mole was waiting at the top of 
the stairs. These squat trucks were 
specially developed for Outward. 
They were heavy, ran on tracks and 
had two giant claws to dig into and 
clutch the earth. 

Before she entered the mole she 
caught a glimpse of the settlement: 
row upon row of squat concrete 
buildings, the nearest some three 
hundred meters from the wire 
fence. Then Red, who was already 
seated inside with Sal, gestured 
impatiently and she climbed in. 

Sal leaned in a corner with his 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



57 




eyes closed. He didn’t look bad, 
just tired. 

Unlike Fred, Red started asking 
questions at once. “Born here?” 

“No. Landed only a month 
ago. 

“That would be on the Hyperi- 

“Yes.” 

“Weren’t you people- on the Hy- 
perion told anything? Didn’t you 
have the faintest idea what 
Outward was like?” ♦ 

Verne sighed. “I suppose we 
didn’t believe it. We knew there 
was a storm when we landed, but 
no planetside storm is supposed to 
bother a ship like that. It didn’t, 
really, except that we landed five 
miles from the terminal and had to 
walk.” 

“Had to walk? Oh, Christ!” 

She decided to test something 
she knew about only theoretically. 
“Please don’t swear,” she said. “I 
don’t like it.” 

“Sure, Verne. Anything you 
say.” 

“And I haven’t invited you to 
call me Verne. Familiarity may be 
common here, but I’m not used to 
it.” 

“Familiarity? Hell, I haven’t 
tried to kiss you yet, have I?” 

Sal opened his eyes and seemed 
to be about to say something. 
Fearing his condition might make 
him say the wrong thing or even 
speak in a language that Red had 
never heard, Verne kept Red’s 
attention off him by saying 



sharply, ’’Didn’t you promise not 
to swear?” 

“Did I? Oh, sure. Verne, you’re 
a honey.” 

“I know. I’ve been told.” 

“I bet you have. Will you shack 
with me?” 

Not knowing exactly what the 
question implied, she ignored it. 
Fortunately at that moment the 
mole stopped and the door slid 
open. 

Red and the other man took Sal 
into what passed for a hospital — 
five beds in a bare room with yet 
another burly man in charge. 

“Have you any money?” he 
asked Verne. 

“No. We lost it with our mole 
when — ” 

“Never mind. We’ll settle that 
later. He’s Sal Slent, you say? Just 
these injuries? No infectious 
disease? Okay.” 

That was all. When she left the 
building with Red she found that 
the other man had driven the mole 
away. 



T he air was now pleasantly 
warm and quite still. It seemed 
incredible that a killer gale had 
been raging a half-hour earlier. 
This unnatural calm was not to be 
trusted. A whiplash of wind could 
strike in the middle of it, without 
warning. 

“I asked if you,” said Red, 
“want to shack with me?” 

There was no help for it. She had 



58 



IF 




to ask cautiously, “What exactly 
does that mean?” 

“Got a man?” 

“No, not—” 

“You could do worse than shack 
with me, babe. Considering you’ve 
no money and no place to go, you 
could hardly do better. I’m not 
hard to get on with. I won’t hit you 
unless you ask for it. I’m a 
construction foreman — good pay, 
no dependents. Two rooms and a 
bathroom to myself. Haven’t had 
a woman since I threw Rose out 
five weeks ago.” 

“Why did you throw her out?” 
“Too many other men. I’ll be 
reasonable about that. There’s 
about five hundred men here and 
less than two hundred women. I 
don’t expect you to act like a wife. 
But not too many other men, huh? 
Three or four, maybe> That’s fair, 
isn’t it?” 

“I’ve never been with a man and 
I have no immediate desire for a 
change in the situation.” 

“Like that, is it?” He nodded to 
himself. “Guess you lost somebody 
in the Hyperion business.” 

She hesitated only' a moment, 
then nodded. 

What she and Sal knew about 
the Outward settlement had been 
learned from radio messages, plus 
letters, log books, reports and 
other documents found in the shell 
of a ship which had blown up. 
From radio messages which had 
flahed between the forty or so 
outposts on the planet she knew as^ 



much about the Hyperion incident 
as anyone who had not been 
directly involved. 

The hurricane had killed nine 
hundred seventy-four people. On 
the planet Outward, you just didn’t 
set out in a straggling file to walk 
five miles over bare moorland. 
Verne knew from intercepted radio 
messages that only ninety bodies 
had ever been found. The rest had 
been dashed to pieces, swept 
scores of miles away, blown into 
marshes, killed by the gnomes or 
sucked bloodless by the hemmers. 

“Well, look,” he^said and 
struggled for a moment. “If it’s 
like that — I’ll marry you if you 
like.” 

It was clear he thought he was 
offering her a great deal. 

“Where I come from,” she said, 
ready to say Earth if he asked, 
“we have a thing called engage- 
ment. We can be engaged if you 
like.” 

Red laughed derisively. That’s 
not for Outward. Especially not 
for Camp Eleven. Sure, a girl can 
say she isn’t going to have any- 
thing to do with men. Or she can 
say it’s marriage or nothing. But 
being engaged — that means you 
say you’ll marry me some time 
but not now, huh?” 

She nodded. 

“And meantime you move in 
with me?” 

She nodded again. 

“That means you think I’m a 
sucker.” 



THE REAL PEOPLE, 



59 




“You think so? It means I trust 
you.” 

He grunted. “That’s a poke in 
the guts.” 

“Why?” 

Verne shrugged. “All right. I 
need a job and somewhere to sleep. 
Where do I go* and whom do I 
see?” 

One word diverted him. “Whom 
do you see? Christ, that fancy 
talk—” 

“Don’t swear.” 

Red rolled his eyes to heaven. At 
last he said, “Like I told you, 
you’re a honey. Maybe you’re 
worth it, babe, if you stand up to 
everything the way you stand up to 
me. But one thing — iLyoy’re going 
to be engaged to me there aren’t 
going to be any other men at all.” 

“Naturally,” Verne said, sur- 
prised. “Obviously,” 

Being engaged to Red seemed a 
good idea, especially when she 
remembered a cynical Terran 
quote on the subject she had picked 
up somewhere: Engagement — a 

period during which a girl looks 
around to see if she can do better 
for herself , . 

H ugh and Pariss were in one 
of the observatories, lying 
back in deep, comfortable chairs 
and watching the stars. 

“You’re a very lovely girl,” said 
Hugh. 

Pariss had been told this before 
but not by a Terran. 

“Thank you.” 



“Although Terrans generally 
would think you are attractive 
perhaps I appreciate you more 
than most. You’re obviously of 
mixed race and so am I. I’m half 
Caucasian, a quarter Polynesian 
and another quarter Asian. Our 
children would be the ultimate in 
racial representation.” 

She started slightly at the men- 
tion of children. 

“Tell me about yourself,” he 
said. “I’m interested.” 

She smiled, stood up and began 
to walk about. “Hugh, let’s make a 
deal. I give you something and you 
give me something. Inforrha- 
tion — true and useful information. 
And we go on like that until one of 
us cheats.” 

“Splendid idea. I hope you won’t 
think it’s cheating if I suggest that 
since it’s your idea, you go first.” 
“We Adamites fear the 
Terrans,” said Pariss quietly. “We 
should like to ignore you. We’d 
rather you didn’t exist. But since 
we learned fifty years ago that you 
do exist, we’ve changed our whole 
way of life — now I think it’s time 
you said something.” 

“I think,” said Hugh slowly, 
“we’d also prefer that you didn’t 
exist. When one human culture, 
numbering umpteen billions ran 
into another nearly as large, it was 
a shock, of course — and not a 
particularly pleasant one. You 
have nothing we want, except your 
Earth-type worlds. To get them 
for ourselves we’d have to fight 



60 



IF 




you and exterminate you. And we 
don’t want that.” 

“Why?” 

“You’re breaking your own 
rules,” he said mildly. “Now you 
tell me something.” 

“All right. We’re more united 
than you. It wasn’t always so, but 
about five centuries ago we fought 
ourselves to a standstill. So few of 
us were left that we were brought 
face to face with the prospect of 
extinction. That’s why there are 
fewer of us than of you. But at least 
we learned our lesson. There won’t 
be any more Adamite civil wars, 
anyway not for another five cen- 
turies.” 

“That’s more than we can say. 
In fact, maybe you’ve put your 
finger on the crux of the matter — 
and if that’s why Eden has discour- 
aged contact and trade between the 
two peoples for half a century, 
maybe she’s right. It’s typical of 
Terrans that there’ll always be 
some idiot who’ll pull the trigger 
But now we come to why you’re 
here Pariss.” 

“We told you. To learn.” 

“Sure, but there’s more than 
that. There must be. Maybe you 
mean to fight now because you’ve 
got something we haven’t got and 
you think you can win. I suppose 
it’s no use asking exactly how 
you took over this station?” 

“No, but I’ll tell you this, 
Hugh— it isn’t anything really 
big, really important. It’s noth- 
ing to make you edgy. It’s nothing 



that would enable us to beat 
Earth.” 

Hugh, who had remained in his 
chair, stood up and took her hands 
in his. She didn’t resist. He was 
very gentle. 

“Thanks, Pariss,” he said. “You 
told me something important 
and I believe you. Just to be fair. 
I’ll tell you something important 
too. I can take over this station 
again any time I like and by means 
so simple it’s really ludi- 
crous — but I won’t, meantime. 
You see, I want to find out just how 
you did it — and more important, 
just why you did it.” 

“We want information, that’s 
all.” She wasn’t meeting his eyes. 
VYou’re cheating, Pariss.” 

She raised her eyes to his and 
looked at him steadily. “Only a 
little. What we want in addition 
to information can't be all that 
important. And some of it at 
least — some of it — I think I could 
have right now for the asking.” 

“Go ahead. Ask.” 

She drew her hands away from 
him. “Not now, Hugh. Not just 
yet.” 

T he second conference, which 
should have been easier, more 
complete, more informative than 
the first, was none of these things.

TOMl—W\\^Fort Plato: 
Pariss, you’re supposed to be 
working, not playing. 

PARISS: I am. He’s nice, 
but there’s something more 
important than that. He’s a 
latent telepath. We sus- 
pected it when we were work- 
ing on the plan to take over 
the station and we therefore 
bypassed him. His latent 
ability, which he doesn’t yet 
suspect, has enabled him to 
guess certain things about 
me, about us. 

TOM I: You’re on the spot, 
you know the circum- 
stances. Is it necessary to kill 
him? . 

PARISS: No, no, no! This 
might be the worst thing we 
could possibly do. [Some- 
thing held back.] 

TOM I: If it is necessary it 
must be done. 

PARISS: What has hap- 
pened in Fort Plato to make 
you so harsh, Tomi? 

TOMI: Our first moves 
here have resulted in a moral 
victory for the Terrans. We 
have to be careful . 

GILEN— Don — M iinchen: 
Of course we’re being care- 
ful. I don’t understand . 

VERNE—Sal— Outward: 
Understanding among us is 
bound to become more dif- 
ficult as our differing ex- 



perience drives us wider 
apart. Incidentally, I’ve 
just been asked to marry a 
Terran. 

TOMI) [Shock, inter- 
est. Agree- 
ment that it 

GIEEN) would be most 
interesting if 
Verne married 

PARISS) the Terran and 
reported on 
the experi- 
ence.] 

VERNE: It is quite clear 
that Pariss is prepared to be- 
come emotionally involved 
with this Hugh Suyang. My 
situation is different. I have 
no love for Red Conrad. If it 
seems necessary to marry 
him I’ll do so entirely for the 
sake of the project. 

TOMI: Good. You’re en- 
tirely right, Verne. Pariss, is 
what Verne said true? 

PARISS: I don’t think of 
Hugh Suyang as a Terran, 
if that’s what you mean.' I 
think of him only as a man. 

TOMI: That’s all very 
well. But remember, you 
hold a secret, a secret that 
must be important. And 
you have said Suyang is a la- 
tent telepath. You must be 
very careful. 

PARISS: [All that came 
was a chuckle.]

R ED’S house was surprisingly 
comfortable. It held ameni- 
ties Verne had not expected. Exter- 
nally it was merely a squat concrete 
box with a single door and two 
small fixed windows of thick 
plastic. Inside it was a proper 
house, with a fully adequate bath- 
room, a kitchen with all the neces- 
sary fittings, a living room and a 
small bedroom. 

“That’s yours,’’ Red said of the 
bedroom. He frowned. “Verne, I 
still think I’m a sucker.’’ 

“Why?’’ 

“Even thinking of letting you get 
away with this. Now I have to go 
and register you. What can you 
do?’’ 

She knew about this. On 
Outward where you came from and 
why were unimportant — but what 
you could do was vital. 

“Quite a lot of things. I’m a fair 
electrician, a good shot with any 
gun. I can nurse, though I’d rather 
not. I can learn to work any 
machine in about half an hour and 
I can count better in my head than 
most people can with a calculator. 
I’m used to working with 
chemicals. I can draw anything you 
want drawn. I’ve.done a lot of work 
with glass — ’’ 

“Honey,’’ said Red with a 
marked change of tone, “I want to 
know you can do what you say. 
Here.’’ 

He gave her a drawing pad and a 



stylus. “Make a picture of me.’’ 
“What?’’ 

“You say you can draw anything 
I want drawn. Draw me.’’ 

She found the stylus could make 
thin lines, thick lines, dark and 
light lines. She sketched quickly, 
competently. 

Red had an interesting face, she 
discovered as she worked. The 
eyes were deep-set and hard, but 
they could become soft. Possibly 
he was a sentimentalist. He had 
thick sensual lips. Probably he 
would be furious if she pointed out 
that they were almost feminine. 
His face had lines it should not 
have had at his age — he could not 
yet be thirty. 

She did a quick portrait, careful 
to omit the finishing touches that 
might betray an alien art. 

Nevertheless, when she offered it 
to him, he was startled, even awed'. 

“Christ!’’ he breathed. “You 
sure as hell can draw, honey. Is 
that me?’’ 

“It’s meant to be.’’ 

“I’m no expert. But I’d say this 
was —well, as I say. I’m no expert. 
What I want to know is, if you can 
draw like this, why did you come to 
Outward?’’ 

“I don’t understand.’’ 

“Honey, most of us are nothing 
much or we wouldn’t be here. I 
don’t mean people who were born 
here — I mean dumb guys like me 
who came from other* places. Here 
I’m a big shot, but where I come 
from I’d never have amounted to

much. You, now — you have talent. 
You didn’t need to come here.” 
“Perhaps I just wanted to.” 

He was not satisfied, yet he was 
prepared to drop the subject for 
the moment. “Anyway, I have to 
report you. I won’t report your old 
man. He can do it himself.” 

She nodded. 

“Make us some supper. I’ll be 
back in half an hour. If I put you 
down as a draftsman — think you 
can handle the job?” 

“I expect so.” 

“I guess that’s why you came to 
Camp Eleven, huh? We sure as hell 
need draftsmen.” 

He didn’t wait for an answer, 
which was just as well, since Verne 
was not quite sure what to answer. 

Left alone in the house, she com- 
pleted a quick survey without 
learning very much. She went into 
the kitchen. 

And there, standing menacingly 
in the middle of the floor, was a 
gnome. It made its intentions clear 
at once. In a grating, rasping voice, 
it said, “Earn gontu kilyu.” 

It took her a few seconds to real- 
ize that it was speaking not its 
own language, but Terran: / am 
going to kill you . 

H OW it had gotten there — it 
had certainly not been there 
when Red showed her the kitchen 
— was an academic question on 
which she wasted no time. 

There was no doubt it was a 
gnome. Outward had only two 



indigenous mobile life forms. The 
hemmers were long and low and 
walked on six short legs. This 
creature was shaped like two stones 
with a larger stone set on top of 
them and a smaller one on top of 
that, faintly reminiscent of human 
legs, trunk and head. It was 
uniformly reddish-brown, exactly 
the color of Outward soil. It 
carried* nothing and wore no 
clothes. The arms were the most 
nonhuman feature, although they 
emerged at approximately the right 
places. They were flexible, 
boneless, handless and could be^ as 
short as half a meter or as long as 
four meters when they lashed out 
like tentacles. 

She had, unfortunately, pulled 
the door shut as she entered. To 
open it she would have to turn and 
operate the handle — the work of a 
moment, but a moment she would 
not be allowed. 

She knew theoretically of the in- 
credible toughness of the gnomes’ 
hide — it enabled them to survive 
the rigors of Outward’s climate, 
alone, without houses, burrowing 
into the ground with those 
incredible arms when storms 
lashed the planet’s surface. She 
could achieve nothing against the 
intruder with her bare hands or 
her softshod feet. 

One of the tentacles lashed out. 
It brushed her jeans quite lightly, 
midway between waist and groin, a 
little to the left of center. 

The tentacle, which had 



64 



IF 




narrowed to the thickness of a 
human wrist as it reached her, 
on its return swelled to the thick- 
ness of the creature’s head. 

“Why do you want to kill me?” 
she asked, just to say something. 
Any delay was to her advantage. 
There was a heavy pot on the 
cooker. But the gnome was 
between her and it. 

“Earn gontu kilyu,” the creature 
rasped and she suspected it knew 
only a few phrases, perhaps one 
only. 

She tried to use the one weapon 
she had — her mind. The effort 
failed completely. Sal was 
evidently asleep, perhaps doped, 
and without him she could not 
reach the others. Her own effort, 
without their assistance, bounced 
back at her. The gnome had a mind 
of sorts, but it was tough as the 
body. All she could touch was hate 
and cruelty — and there was no 
better shield against any mind 
probe than hate. 

She tried to touch Red and 
found certain contact. She sensed 
he was thinking, Someone*s 
walking on my grave, a phrase that 
meant nothing to her. 

The gnome’s other arm lashed 
out. It caught her around the waist 
like a whip, spinning her a half 
turn. The gnome wanted to inspect 
her back. It proved uninteresting, 
and so the tentacle spun her again 
just as she was considering a snatch 
at the door handle. 

The tentacle constricted about 



her diaphragm until she gasped. 
The gnome could quite easily crush 
her to death. 

It had no immediate intention of 
doing so, however, still being 
moved by curiosity. It knew she 
was completely in its power. It 
could kill her any time it wished. 

A gain a tentacle shot out. The 
creature wanted to check 
something. Verne’s hip bones were 
hard and she was hard across the 
back. The waist was soft and the 
tentacle probed softness down her 
front. The gnome prodded her 
abdomen and hips, establishing 
the areas of softness. Then the 
gnome tested her solar plexus and 
noted Verne’s discomfort when this 
area was rammed hard. It also felt 
her ribs and established that slaps 
there did not trouble her. 

Verne called Red mentally 
again. Nothing happened. 

So she tried the gnome, with ex- 
actly the same result she had noted 
before. Hate and cruelty were 
there. Perhaps the cruelty she 
sensed explained what was 
happening. The gnome not only 
wished to find out about humans, 
his enemies, and not only carefully 
stored up in his brain a knowledge 
of their obvious weak spots; he was 
also trying to terrify her. His great- 
est victory would be frightening her 
to death. She was to realize that the 
death blow could come at any 
time now — and certainly would 
come — but never to know when. 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



65 




“I don’t fear you,” she said. 
Again the words were just 
something to say. 

“Earn gontu kilyu,” said the 
gnome. A tentacle wavered out 
again, slowly this time. Verne 
moved a little to avoid it, failing, 
but getting herself away from the 
door. If help were to come, it 
would come through there. She 
didn’t want to be in the way of a 
shot at the gnome. 

The tentacle barely touched her, 
so gently that she guessed it was 
listening. The idea suggested what 
the creature’s purpose was. The 
gnome wanted to locate her heart. 

It had tried the abdomen first. 
Perhaps the gnome’s own heart 
was there. In the unlikely event of 
her escaping this crisis and 
subsequently facing a gnome when 
she was wearing steel boots, she 
intended to lunge at its underbelly. 

Having found the heart, the 
gnome punched it viciously with 
the other tentacle. 

Verne cried out in pain, 
staggered and had to press back 
against the wall to recover herself. 
But she was only momentarily 
hurt. The blow was no harder than 
that of a man’s fist and, the gnome 
being short, it came from below. 

She did not think the blow was 
meant to be fatal. The gnome was 
doing what all cruel creatures 
did — demonstrating, after all this 
suspense, that it meant to hurt her, 
that her death was not to be quick 
and easy. 



Yet for the first time she began 
to hope. The gnome was making a 
mistake. It had not probed her 
throat, because its own head was 
set into its trunk with no neck. A 
quick thrust and constriction with 
either tentacle would have 
strangled a human more quickly 
than any other means — but the 
creature had picked on the heart 
area, which in a human was 
reasonably well protected against 
mere blows. 

If Red came back, if the gnome 
found itself with only a second or 
two in which to kill her, it would 
strike at her heart. And though this 
would not be fun, almost certainly 
she would survive. 

Delay became more important 
than ever. 

She was delighted to discover 
that the gnome was going on with 
the game. A tentacle lightly 
touched her face and then her shirt. 
Apparently for the first time the 
gnome realized that her clothing 
was not part of her. 

The tentacle became a claw and 
ripped her shirt. The gnome 
deliberated for several seconds, its 
little red eyes surveying her coldly. 
Then the tentacle tore the tatters 
from her body. 

Gnomes were not too bright. His 
new discovery occupied this one for 
a long time. It retracted the 
tentacle and stood motionless for 
fully two minutes while it decided 
that the tall, thin creature which 
faced it was pink all over. Or 



66 



IF 




something equally inconclusive. 
Next it tried to tear her pants, but 
they fitted snugly. Without more 
violence than it seemed at the 
moment prepared to employ, the 
gnome could get nowhere. 

With a change of approach, it 
punched savagely at the solar 
plexus. This time, although Verne 
was hurt considerably, she tried 
not to show it. 

Suddenly the gnome moved its 
feet. At the same time she heard a 
door opening in the house. Red was 
back. 

The gnome said, “Ecum bak for- 
yu” — 

It turned and clawed open a cup- 
board door. There was a hole in the 
floor, a hole less than half the 
gnome's diameter. But it flowed 
into the hole head first and Verne 
realized that the rest of its body 
was as pliable and boneless as its 
versatile tentacles. 

It made no attempt to strike at 
Verne, although it would have had 
plenty of time to stab at her heart 
and still get into the hole before 
Red arrived. 

Nevertheless, she felt its hate, its 
cruelty, its fearlessness and its 
desire to kill her. And its words 
echoed in her brain: Vll come back 
for you. 



R ed burst in, sniffling, 
“Gnomes!” he shouted. 

“Not gnomes. Just one gnome.” 
“Where?” 



“It went that way.” She showed 
him the hole. 

He swore. His rage was directed 
mainly against the crew that had 
built the house. “Damn them to 
hell! I’ll get them. Jerry-building 
on Earth is only dishonest. Here 
it’s murder. The foundations are 
supposed to be six-inch reinforced 
concrete. The gnomes and 
hemmers can’t get through that.” 

He bent to examine the floor in 
the cupboard. “This is only a shell. 
Damn — I hope a gnome gets the 
foreman.” 

Still sniffing, he turned to her, 
his eyes widening. Until now, the 
gnome’s recent presence had 
distracted him from noticing that 
she was naked above the waist. 

Awkwardly he turned away. 
“What in hell happened? It didn’t 
get a chance to get at you, huh? Did 
it pop its head through the hole just 
as I got back?” 

“It’s been here since you left. So 
was I.” 

Red stiffened. “But that’s 
impossible. I mean — ” 

He looked at her again, noticing 
now the red marks on her body. 
His eyes dropped to the torn shirt 
where the gnome had flung it. 

“It was here with you,” he said 
incredulously, “all that time? And 
you’re still alive — ” 

She moved to the sink and 
washed herself where the gnome’s 
tentacles had touched her, having 
learned already that plain cold 
water was effective against the 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



67 




irritants of Outward. As she did so, 
she told Red in detail what had 
happened. 

He didn’t say a word. He kept 
looking at her incredulously, 
occasionally shaking his head. 

With some asperity Verne asked, 
“You don’t believe me? You think 
I’m a liar?’’ 

“Oh, I believe you all right. I can 
still smell the gnome and I saw his 
mark on you.’’ Suddenly his tone 
grew angry. “Will you for Pete’s 
sake cover yourself? What are you 
trying to do to me?’’ 

“I have nothing else to wear.” 

He rushed from the room and re- 
turned with a shirt. He threw it at 
her. She put it on. Red was 
ashamed of his outburst, she 
sensed. He was again regarding her 
with the awe, the wonder that she 
had seen before. 

“Well, tell me,” she said. “I was 
sure, too, that the gnome would 
never let me live. But it did. 
Doesn’t that ever happen?” 

“I’ve heard of it,” said Red 
slowly. “Certainly it happens. But 
I’ve never heard of it happening 
with a girl. The gnomes are cruel. 
Cruelty is built into them. They’re 
cruel as the planet is cruel. Human 
sadists get a kick out of hurting 
people, but we think the gnomes 
get even more out of it. They like to 
hurt, but it’s fear that counts. 
Particularly fear of death.” 

She nodded. “That’s what 1 
thought.” 

“When they catch a victim and 



they have time, as this one had with 
you, they screw up his fear as far as 
it will go. If their prey is 
defenseless, knows it’s going to die, 
the gnome senses and feeds the 
fear. And when the gnome’s 
satisfied, when it really feels good, 
the victim dies. Sometimes, 
though, when a human isn’t afraid, 
when he or she has too much self- 
respect to grovel and shriek, there’s 
nothing in it for the gnome. It has 
failed to set the victim up for 
death, see? The time hasn’t come. 
There’s no more satisfaction in it 
for the gnome than killing a tree, 
which can’t show any sign of caring 
about it.” 

He took a deep breath. “Some- 
times — when it happens like that — 
the man lives. You must be the 
bravest girl I ever met.” 

She laughed. “Brave? I didn’t 
want to die. I kept on looking for 
ways not to die. That’s not 
courage,” 

“Maybe not. But I guess you 
fooled the gnome.” 

L ife at Fort Plato went on in 
an atmosphere of incredible 
calm. 

The Adamites interfered 
scarcely at all in the normal 
running of the station. They took 
comprehensive precautions to 
ensure that no message from the 
fort could reveal the true situation 
to TDC or anyone else. They kept 
the Terrans away from the wea- 



68 



IF 




pons, the machines, the laborator- 
ies (except under strict supervi- 
sion), the computers. Beyond that, 
having once interfered with the 
running of the routine affairs of 
the station and finding cause to 
regret it, they acted almost as 
guests. 

Seven of them spoke English 
perfectly. The rest of the four hun- 
dred picked up the language as 
any occupying soldiers would. 

Wil Slent spent almost all his 
time with books, records and 
microfilm. He was a book man, 
strict, correct. He worked hard. 
The object of his presence in Fort 
Plato was to learn all he could 
about the Terrans and he single- 
mindedly devoted sixteen hours a 
day to his task. 

Tomi was bored and made no at- 
tempt to hide it. There was a 
stubborn, tacit refusal among 
almost all theTerrans, young and 
old, even to say hello to her. They 
knew the part she had played in the 
fall of Fort Plato and she became a 
symbol to them. She was the 
Adamites; she was their defeat; she 
was the occupation. 

For this reason she saw a lot of 
John Stewart. She didn’t like him 
and he didn’t act as if he liked her. 
Yet he talked to her, as freely as he 
would ever talk. 

She didn’t know why this was 
and she didn’t care. She saw no 
danger in talking candidly to 
Stewart. 

She was wrong. 



F or the third time Dr. Roger 
Miller read through all the re- 
ports he had been able to assemble 
on the so-called Maribisans, Don 
and Gilen Slent. 

Everyone in the Personnel 
Building who had encountered 
the visitors, however briefly, had 
been asked to report. The suspicion 
that they were Adamites was never 
mentioned. 

Certain small, isolated identity 
factors emerged. 

Both of them spoke Enghlish too 
correctly. Their speech was not al- 
ways pedantic, their accent not al- 
ways flawless — certain colloquial- 
isms were used by them. But it was 
as if someone, not necessarily they 
themselves, had made a careful 
study of many examples of the 
language and what they had been 
taught was a distillation of these 
examples. 

They clung to each other in a 
strange way not inconsistent with 
their being father and daughter — 
but the relationship seemed more 
exclusive of others than would be 
expected of a comparatively young 
parent from a provincial planet and 
a lovely girl. 

The medical examination 
showed that the girl had had her 
appendix removed surgically, but 
that was not conclusive evidence 
of alienness — it was quite possible 
that this operation was still 
performed on Maribis. Indeed, the 
medical evidence was rather 
against the theory that they were 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



69 




Adamites, for there were confused 
indications of recent specifically 
Terran ancestry. 

This was particularly puzzling. 

Checking failed to confirm or 
deny that the Slents had arrived on 
the ship Nord from Hylon as they 
claimed. Their names were on the 
passenger list, but no one 
remembered them. That, too, was 
inconclusive; the vessel was back 
in space, beyond contact. The few 
crewmen who had elected not to 
stay with the ship and hence were 
available for questioning simply 
had happened to have nothing to 
do with these two passengers — who 
had probably kept to themselves if 
their present behavior were 
anything to go by. 

One of those who remained, the 
purser, acted strangely when ques- 
tioned. No, he didn’t remember 
them — what was the trouble? Why 
were two passengers so important? 
He had been in the employ of 
Spacelines for twenty-nine years 
and had never been grilled before. 
Did they think he’d taken a bribe? 
He insisted on a lie-detector test, (it 
revealed nothing except that he 
believed he was telling the truth.) 
Yes, he had been scheduled to 
make the next trip on the Nord, 
Only an undiagnosed illness the 
night before departure had made 
him miss the trip. The illness had 
turned out to be an allergy. 

Miller stabbed his intercom as if 
trying to kill it. 

“Tell Miss Heilbron I want to 



see her,’’ he snapped. “No. Ask 
Miss Heilbron if I may see her. 
Ask if it would be convenient if 1 
called on her on a matter of 
considerable importance.’’ 

The reply came within forty-five 
seconds. Miss Heilbron would be 
honored to receive him. He 
suspected sarcasm, but he could 
not complain of the phraseology. 

He wasted no time. “Miss Heil- 
bron if our guests are not Adamites 
they’re equally worthy of attention 
and investigation. I have two 
suggestions. But first, have you 
seen the medical report?’’ 

“Yes.’’ 

“The medical report is the one 
thing I find hard to explain.’’ 
“Except of course,’’ she suggest- 
ed gently, “on the basis that the 
doctors concerned were fools and 
got it all wrong.’’ 

“Naturally 1 am not ignoring 
that possibility.’’ 

“Naturally not.’’ 

“You must rescind your proviso. 
I may have to meet them myself. 
At least I must be free to do so if I 
consider it necessary.’’ 

“Of course.’’ 

He stared at her. “Of course?’’ 

“I merely wished to make a 
point. Dr. Miller. We can consider 
it made, can’t we?’’ 

“Wasn’t it rather a childish way 
to make it?’’ 

“Probably. I am a very childish 
person. Dr. Miller.’’ 

“I am trying not to lose my tem- 
per. Please do not provoke me.’’

IF 




“You must be mistaken. I’m not 
generally regarded as highly pro- 
vocative.” 

“Understandably,” he retorted 
cruelly and was satisfied by her 
faint flush. “You agree telepathy 
must be investigated?” 

“1 thought hypnosis.” 

“To hypnotize a person you 
must be in his presence, or at least 
in communication with him. In the 
circumstances, it seems the only 
means of communication must 
have been telepathy.” 

“You mean they worked from 
outside, from another ship, on the 
people in the TVorrf?” 

“Brilliant, Miss Heilbron. Allow 
me -to congratulate you on your 
unerring detection of the 
obvious.” 

She said nothing, merely looking 
at him wryly, her expression more 
telling than words. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “All right, 
I am well aware I’m hard to get on 
with. I must be the most difficult 
man in the world to get on with.” 
“Dr. Miller, I’m sure you exag- 
gerate. Besides,” she added kindly, 
“there are many other worlds.” 

He swallowed that. “I have a 
telepathic rating of zero. I intend 
to enlist a person who calls himself 
The Great Nicolas.” 

Miss Heilbron was genuinely 
surprised. “I grasp your idea, 
but — isn’t he just a mountebank?” 
“Probably,” said Miller glumly. 
“But I hope he’s not. I most 
sincerely hope he’s not.” 



HE GREAT NICOLAS was 
appearing in London, much to 
the annoyance of Dr. Miller. Nico- 
las had been in Stuttgart the week 
before. Miller had to fly to 
London. 

Using the enormous power of 
Personnel, he had discovered that 
The Great Nicolas was Nick 
Grumeyer, one-time conman. 

Miller was in the audience in a 
London night club when the lights 
dimmed and brass blared to 
announce The Great Act. 

Spotlights picked out three cor- 
rectly shaped blondes, one in green, 
one in red, one in blue. Their 
elaborate costumes contained an. 
enormous quantity of silk, lace, 
frills and fur, considering how little 
of their wearers they concealed. 
The girls turned toward each 
other, stretching out their spangled 
arms to form a triangle. Each sank 
to one knee. The Great Nicolas 
slowly appeared in the triangle, 
wearing white evening dress. 

The act included illusion as well 
as telepathy. He, snapped his 
fingers and the girl in red had a 
blue dress, the one in green a red 
dress and the one in blue a green 
dress. He snapped his fingers and 
each girl became two, then three, 
then four, swirling out of one 
another. 

There was a lot more of this, 
which bored Miller because he had 
not flown to London to see 
anything of the sort. He didn’t 
know how it was done and he didn’t 




THE REAL PEOPLE 



71 




care.That it was not magic he was 
certain. 

The girls unfastened their enor- 
mous skirts and were suddenly 
dressed in silver leotards. They 
moved into the audience and lights 
picked them out as they leaned 
provocatively over fat men. 

“Snakeskin wallet, comb, 
driving license in name of Andrew 
Flambert,” said Nicolas and a girl 
produced these items from a man’s 
pocket. “Five keys, a pocket knife, 
nail scissors — appointment book, 
handkerchief^ pencil — nail varnish, 
nail file, lipstick — ” 

It was effective because it was 
quick, because it was always right 
and because so many pockets and 
handbags were probed. Obviously 
there couldn’t be that many stooges 
in the audience. 

You re Nick Grumeyer and Vm 
here to get you. Miller thought 
with concentrated venom. What 
you stole from me isnt half what 
you make in a night here, but I 
know ril never get that from you, 
Vll get something else, Vll make 
you pay in blood, Nick Grumeyer, 

One of the silver girls made a 
strange genture with a stiff wrist 
and came toward him. No lights 
followed her. Nobody but Miller 
looked at her. There were eleven 
other girls and Nicolas, who was 
now telling the audience about 
their scars. 

The silver girl whispered in 
Miller’s ear, “Please come with 
me, sir.’’ 



“All right,’’ he said. “Let’s go.” 
The girl opened a side door, led 
him along a bare passage and into 
a dressing room. She faced him. 
“Who are you?” she asked. 

She was older than he had 
thought, though not less attractive. 
Possibly she was sixty, his own age. 

He guessed that she was the 
girls’ leader, perhaps even Nico- 
las’s boss. 

“You threatened Nick,” she 
said. 

The threat had achieved its 
object. “It was a test,” he said. 
“I’m Dr. Roger Miller of UN. I 
want to consult The Great 
Nicolas.” 

“Why did you threaten him?” 
“To see if he could sense the 
threat.” 

“Well, he did,” she said grimly. 
“Never fool around with telepathy. 
It can be a terrible thing.” 
“Terrible? Do you mean danger- 
ous?” 

“That, too. But terrible in other 
ways. It can turn you inside out.” 
“You’re a telepath, then? And 
you don’t like it?” 

“I hate it.” 

He was interested. “Yet it’s your 
living.” 

“Nick could manage without 
me. But he’d use somebody else.” 
“You’re — his wife?” 

“Yes. Doris Grumeyer. Now 
shut up.” 

“I didn’t know he had a wife.” 
“It is believed we live together. 
Professionally that’s a convenience

IF 




at times. Please be quiet. You want 
to see Nick. He’s prepared to see 
you.” 

Miller sat down, perfectly 
prepared to wait. It seemed quite 
likely now that he had guessed 
right in deciding to consult The 
Great Nicolas. 

A SEC RET meeting was held in 
Fort Plato. General Morrison 
knew nothing about it. John 
Stewart knew nothing about it. 
Hardly anyone in high authority 
among the Terrans knew about 
it — and none of the Adamites. 

Former Checker Alan Stewart 
knew about it and wished he didn’t. 

His position in Fort Plato after 
the trial was miserable. Had he 
been executed he would have been 
a martyr and might even in time 
have been turned into a hero. When 
he was released, however, reaction 
set in and most of the Terrans in 
the fort now considered him to be 
the criminal the Adamites had 
failed to prove he was. After all, he 
could have stopped the Adamites 
and had not done so. 

He happened to learn about the 
meeting and something of its pur- 
pose, but was excluded from it. 
Warned grimly to keep quiet, he al- 
most managed to forget he knew 
about the matter. 

It was not difficult for men and 
women who knew every inch of the 
station to find a place where they 
could talk in secret. Although scan- 
ners were everywhere and 



Adamites were in the checkpoint 
now, people who knew exactly 
where the scanners were could 
defeat them. 

It was a meeting of revolution- 
aries. Inevitably their conclusions 
were violent and bloody. 

Tomi, reading in her room 
sensed enough disturbance to tell 
her father that something was in 
the wind. He told her to go to the 
checkpoint and see if she could 
discover anything there. 

At the checkpoint, with the help 
of two Adamite technicians who 
had been studying the available 
facilities, she cast her net wide. She 
looked in and eavesdropped on 
Morrison, Stewart and many 
others who were important in Fort 
Plato. She found nothing to explain 
her vague sense of danger. She 
went in search of John Stewart and 
found him in the main library. 

He seemed less interested in her 
concern than in what had caused it. 

“You said it’s a feeling?” he 
asked. “A hunch?” 

“I never ignore a hunch. Do 
you?” 

“Tomi, you give the impression 
this is more than a hunch. Tell 
me. 

She had no intention of telling 
him that Fort Plato had fallen 
mainly because Wil Slent and 
herself had touched a few receptive 
minds from millions of miles away 
and made people who were 
working automatically, thinking 
of something else, unconsciously

throw a switch here, put a circuit 
out of operation there, fail to 
notice that a red light had come on, 
turn off an alarm. 

“I know something’s happen- 
mg. 

“You know?’’ 

She had to play it down. “I had 
this feeling — oh, forget it. What 
are you reading?” 

He showed her the book. It was 
The Eden Myth by Dr. Roger 
Miller. 

“Myth?” she asked. “Eden 
doesn’t exist?” 

Stewart smiled. “That’s not 
what the title means. Miller 
examines the purely Terran sources 
of the Eden legend and the name 
itself. The word eden is Hebrew 
and means ‘delight’ — the Greek 
version of the Old Testament uses 
a word paradeisos, from the 
Persian. Edin was the Sumerian 
name for the plain of Babylon. 
Miller shows that the Adamites 
never called themselves 
Adamites — or their world Eden — 
until they had learned that Terrans 
had legends that the human race 
began in a place called the Garden 
of Eden and that the first man was 
Adam.” 

“Well, that’s what he would say, 
isn’t it?” 

“How do you feel about Earth?” 

“I just don’t feel anything about 
Earth. Go back to your book. 
Who’s Miller anyway?” 

“He works at UN headquarters 
in Munich.” 



“Munich?” She was suddenly 
thoughtful. “Is that another name 
for Miinchen?” 

“Same place.” 

She turned away. Her feeling of 
unease had passed. And she still 
didn’t like Stewart. She didn’t 
dislike him either. It was a pity. All 
the indications were that she 
would go on being lonely and 
slightly bored. She was looking 
forward to the warm, complete 
contact with her sisters that was to 
take place in a few hours. 

T DID not take place. 

Sal Slent was deeply unconsci- 
ous on Outward. It had proved nec- 
essary, when his foot did not im- 
prove after some days, to perform 
a small surgical operation on it. 
This was all Tomi could learn. 

In Miinchen Gilen and Don 
were together, but Gilen was un- 
easy rather as Tomi had been; un- 
communicative. She broke the 
contact quickly. Tomi had no 
chance to ask her what if anything 
she knew of a Dr. Roger Miller. 

In Station 692 Pariss declared 
briefly and firmly that with a la- 
tent telepathic talent around, all 
such communication had better be 
suspended, temporarily at least. 

Tomi was left with the impres- 
sion that if her father were not so 
eager to return to his bookwork, 
which seemed to occupy him now 
to the exclusion of all else, she 
would have been able to make bet- 
ter contact at least with Gilen.

VI 

T he guerillas struck in the 
night. 

The Adamites had become care- 
less. Seven days had passed during 
which the Terrans gave every indi- 
cation of having accepted the situ- 
ation reasonably, if not enthusi- 
astically. 

If the Terrans had been difficult 
from the start Adamite control 
would have been adjusted 
accordingly. But almost every 
man, woman and child in the sta- 
tion had behaved carefully right 
along — like students with a new 
teacher — and the Adamites had 
failed to recognize a sizing-up 
period for what it was. 

The guerillas, as they called 
themselves, let the sentries alone 
with few exceptions. The Adamites 
in checkpoint, two men and a 
woman, were offered poisoned 
coffee. The three Adamites would 
not have accepted refreshment 
from a Terran seven days earlier. 
No longer suspicious, they drank 
the coffee and died. 

Some sleeping Adamites were 
slain. The victims were not 
necessarily important but they 
could be killed without raising an 
alarm. Two soldiers who were with 
Terran girls, contrary to orders, 
were easy and obvious victims. 
Tomi and Wil Slent were spared 
because they were well guarded. 
Arol, on the other hand, was one of 
the first victims. 



Three Terrans, all girls, knew 
they were giving their lives — the 
girl who poisoned the Adamite 
checkers and the two who slew 
their lovers. They would be traced 
later. The others struck secretly, 
often at men and women they knew 
not at all. The aim was simply to 
kill as many Adamites as possible. 
Many killed more than once. 

When a force of four hundred 
attempted to control a community 
of five thousand and when, 
moreover, there was at least a 
pretense of normalcy, of peaceful 
occupation if not friendship, a 
carefully planned coup could be 
bloodily successful. 

The guerillas killed two hundred 
and one Adamites with no loss to 
themselves. 

The Adamites they could not kill 
were those who resumed full con- 
trol of Fort Plato the next morn- 
ing. 

W IL SLENT, dragged rudely 
back to reality from his fas- 
cinating private research, clamped 
down hard. 

All five thousand Terrans were 
rounded up at gunpoint and 
locked up, either in large numbers 
in the halls and storehouses or in 
their own homes. 

Tomi was given the job of 
compiling a casualty list. As she 
went her rounds she was sick four 
times, until at last she could only 
retch painfully. 

The men with Tomi, trained 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



75 




soldiers, were cool and detached. 
An Adamite soldier was not 
trained to be without feelings — he 
was trained to direct his feelings to 
maximum effect. 

A sergeant remarked at one 
point, “You have to give them 
credit. It’s a fine job.’’ 

Tomi stared at him uncompre- 
hendingly. 

The sergeant felt called on to 
explain. “Well, they couldn’t 
recapture the fort and they 
accepted that. An effort like this, 
directed against men on duty, 
would have been crushed in five 
minutes. Instead they killed as 
many of us as they could, as quietly 
as they could, so that they could go 
on all night. It -was a night of 
killing. Lovely job.’’ "" 

Tomi could not understand him, 
but if his words had been translated 
any guerilla of any nation in 
history would have understood him 
at once. 

Wil Slent’s attitude was 
different. To lose two hundred men 
in taking Fort Plato in battle would 
have been a mere nothing; indeed 
to take it at all with any loss would 
have been a remarkable achieve- 
ment. But to take it with no loss 
and then allow half the occupying 
force to be butchered was a grave 
error. ^ 

“If I had a competent second in 
command,’’ he admitted to Tomi, 
“it would be my duty to relinquish 
control to him. But Arol is dead. 
We have no other senior officer 



who speaks their language — unless 
you want to take command?’’ 
“There has to be a Naval 
commander,’’ Tomi said. “You 
have to stay in command.” 

“My tactics were badly 
mistaken. But how could anyone 
guess,” said Wil, justifying himself, 
“that any group of reasonable 
human beings would commit such 
an act while remaining completely 
in our power? The situation I set up 
should in itself have precluded any 
such possibility. We can draw two 
hundred replacements from the 
ship. They’ll be here in twelve 
hours. The Terrans knew they 
could not overcome us. What could 
they hope to gain?” 

“Self-respect, perhaps,” said 
Tomi. “They simply had to spit in 
our eye.” 

“Yes, I have encountered such 
an attitude in my reading. Of 
course we must take the usual 
action. Three for one. Six hundred 
Terrans must be executed.” 

Tomi nodded, but so reluctantly 
that Wil said, “You don’t agree? 
You think it’s harsh?” 

“I don’t think it matters whether 
it’s harsh or not. The point is, is it 
wise? I suggest you get Stewart 
here and tell hirii what you’re 
proposing.” 

“If I do, there can be no change. 
It is out of the question for me to 
declare my intention and not carry 
it out.” 

“Then don’t tell him your inten- 
tion. Tell him what you propose 



76 



IF 




to do and see what happens.” 

“Very well. But why Stewart? It 
should be General Morrison.” 

“Do you want to make it 
official? Then speak to General 
Morrison.” 

“I see. Yes, your idea has merit, 
Tomi.” 

When Stewart was told Wil 
Slent proposed to execute six 
hundred Terrans, he said, “It will 
be a long war.” 

“What do you mean?” 

Stewart merely shrugged. 

“You think Earth will fight if we 
do this?” 

“Don’t you?” 

“But no injustice will be 
committed. You Terrans treacher- 
ously fell on us and — ” 

Stewart laughed without humor. 
“You attack us, take ijis over — and 
don’t expect reprisals?’^ 

“You kill two hundred of us and 
don’t expect reprisals?” 

Stewart unwrapped a pepper- 
mint and sucked it reflectively. 
“Slent, try to imagine the position 
exactly reversed. What would 
Adamites have done?” 

“Planned to overthrow you. 
Adamite officers would never have 
considered a pointless massacre 
like this.” 

“Neither did ours.” 

“I don’t understand you at all.” 
“You took over the station. You 
broke up our system of authority, 
our system of communication. 
General Morrison has not been in 
command even of the Terrans in 



the fort since your coup. It is 
nonsense to speak of what ‘we’ did. 

I know nothing of this. General 
Morrison knew nothing of it.” 
“Would you have voted against 
the massacre if you had had a 
vote?” 

“Certainly.” 

“On what grounds?” 

“Grounds of ethics, expediency, 
legality and cowardice, among 
others.” 

“Cowardice? Fear?” 

“Not for myself. But the thought 
of the galactic war that might 
follow your doing the criminally 
stupid thing you propose frightens 
the life out of me.” 

“Stewart, two hundred and one 
of us have been killed. By our laws, 
as an occupying force, the natural 
consequence is the execution of six 
hundred and three of you,” 

“Any six hundred and three?” 
“All the assassins we can 
establish, plus others selected on a 
random basis.” 

“And that’s Adamite justice?” 
Wil flushed at the sudden biting 
incredulity in Stewart’s tone. He 
knew, though, that Stewart could 
suit the tone of his voice to his 
purpose. 

Wil explained: “That’s Adamite 
, expediency. Such things must not 
be allowed to happen again.” 

“I suggest you forget the whole 
thing.” 

For once Stewart had been 
stupid. 

“That’s obviously impossible.” 



THE REAL PEOPLE

“Agreed. Then forget the three- 
to-one ratio. Terrans used to be- 
lieve in an eye for an eye and a 
tooth for a tooth. Deep down, we 
still do.” 

“You mean we must execute 
only two hundred and one 
Terrans?” 

“I mean nothing of the sort. I 
mean you must forget the three-to- 
one ratio.” 

Wil nodded. “I understand 
you.” 

He would not let the discussion 
go further. 

T he Great Nicolas proved to be 
a smallish man, quite bald, with 
an impediment in his speech of 
which there was no sign, when he 
was on stage. 

Doris remained in the room 
while he and Miller talked. She 
said nothing. She watched Miller 
steadily all the time. 

Grumeyer’s manner was 
friendlier than his wife's. Miller 
easily understood why he had been 
a successful conman. 

“This is very interesting,” 
Grumeyer said. “But you have 
nothing to go on but guesses? The 
man and girl you tell me about may 
be Adamites — and may be 
telepaths?” 

Miller nodded. “You as a 
telepath,” he said with some 
asperity, “should have no difficulty 
in checking on the latter 
possibility.” 

“Not very much,” Grumeyer 



agreed. “But I imagine you don’t 
want these two alerted?” 

“You imagine correctly.” 

“That makes it more difficult.” 
“You are a telepath?” Miller 
asked bluntly. 

Grumeyer smiled. “I should 
have thought that has been clearly 
established.” 

“One thing puzzles me. 
Scientists and psychologists still 
know very little about telepathy. 
Yet you have a telepathic act. And 
there are others. Why can’t the 
scientists establish anything 
definite? Why don’t they test you?” 
“I have been approached. Scien- 
tists always wish to study a thing 
under their conditions. They think 
up the test, set up the experiment 
and believe before it starts that it 
must be a good test because they 
have thought it up. This is rather 
like ruling that the best tennis 
player is the one who can hit most 
balls through a hole in the wall. 
Something is tested, but what? 
Certainly not the ability to win 
matches.” 

“I see what you mean. I’ve heard 
you once were a good swindler.” 
“Ah, that. 1 will explain. I had a 
miserable childhood. Doctor. I 
was genuinely misunderstood. I 
did not know that I was different, 
you see. Suddenly, when I was 
about fifteen, everything changed. 
1 found it was easy to make people 
give me things. I could tell when I 
was pleasing them and when I was 
making them angry. I soothed

IF 




them until they wanted to give me 
something. Girls, too.” 

His eyes flickered briefly to 
Doris, who did not move. 

“My wife knows this. Even now 
women flock to me. I’m an ugly 
little man, yet women beg me not 
only for love but for anything else I 
care to give them. That is how I 
became what you call a swindler. 
The choice^was not mine. The 
profession was forced on me by my 
victims. At the time I could find 
nothing else I could do 
successfully. It was only when I 
met Doris that — ” 

He paused, then said more 
briskly, “There is one thing about 
telepathy the scientists find hard to 
believe and therefore make no 
attempt to prove — it is a collabor- 
ative talent. Just as mindreading 
demands a mind to read and a 
mind to be read, two people can 
form a partnership many times 
more effective than any individual 
can be. These two are not the 
same, do not have the same func- 
tions. There is the fulcrum and the 
lever. Although the two individuals 
who form a team do not have to 
be man and wife, it does seem es- 
sential for them to be of different 
sexes. I have been able to meld 
with many women, but never 
really successfully with a man.” 
“You work — meld, you say — 
with all the girls in your act?” 

“It’s hard to say yes or no. There 
are no words for what scientists 
investigate but refuse to believe. I 



meld invariably and easily with 
Doris. I — well, contact the other 
girls.” 

“To return to the man and girl 
who call themselves Maribisans — ” 

“Yes, it’s interesting that they 
are a man and girl — interesting, 
too, that they claim to be father 
and daughter.” 

“Claim to be?” 

“They may very well be so. My 
thought was merely that they 
would do so anyway. They would 
call themselves father and 
daughter, husband and wife or 
brother and sister because 
telepathic partnership demands 
proximity.” 

Miller leaned forward, 
interested. “It doesn’t work over 
distances?” 

“That’s not what I mean at all. 
The partners have to be close, 
preferably within sight of each 
other. It’s no use having a fulcrum 
here and a lever somewhere else.” 

“I see. Another point occurs to 
me. One would imagine telepaths 
would sense other telepaths.” 

“Yes.” 

“Could the man and girl in 
Miinchen sense you as a more than 
usually talented telepath?” 

“No.” 

“You are very definite.” 

Grumeyer opened a drawer. He 
produced a piece of apparatus that 
resembled a primitive crystal set 
for the reception of radio signals. 

“Like many discoveries, this was 
made by accident,” said Grumeyer. 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



79 




“Exactly what it does or why, I 
neither know nor care. I know its 
effect, which is all that matters. In 
the past we suffered interference. 
Mental interference. Thoughts 
from outside, thoughts we did not 
want. Probably my particular men- 
tal activity interested, stimulated, 
attracted similar mental activity.” 
He placed the device back where 
he had found it, but did not close 
the drawer. 

“I discovered this apparatus by 
chance, as I told you. It has some 
kind of shorting or limiting effect. 
I set it before every performance. 
Although it does not interfere 
significantly with the act, it 
prevents telepaths far away from 
becoming interested.” 

“Similar to jamming radio 
signals?” 

“Yes. Similar. But unlike 
jamming, it does not draw 
attention to itself. I call it the 
Blanket.” 

“Mr. Grumeyer, are you going 
to help me?” 

“By going to Miinchen? No.” 
“Any reasonable expenses — ” 
“Not a matter of money. If what 
you say is true I fear these people. 
Damage can easily be done in a 
mind. We all have a secret fear. I 
shall tell you mine — fear of being 
physically sound and mentally 
crippled.” 

“So you won’t help?” 

“I did not say that either.” He 
hesitated and finally said, “This 1 
will promise you. If you learn that 



these two are enemies of our race, 
if you can honestly say they are 
dangerous — immediately danger- 
ous, not potentially dangerous — 
ask me again and I may come.” 
With that Miller had to be 
content. The Great Nicolas would 
go no further. And Doris merely 
looked at him silently. 

4<¥^ONDERLAND?” Pariss 
asked. 

“You’ve never heard of 
our Wonderlands?” 

She puckered her brows in 
thought. “I’ve heard of a book, 
Alice in Wonderland — ” 

“Our Wonderlands aie not quite 
like that, though there are 
similarities. Alice saw her 
Wonderland in a dream. We visit 
ours fully awake.” 

“And you want me to come with 
you? Hugh, give me your word this 
isn’t a trick.” 

“What kind of trick?” he asked. 
“Wonderland is made up entirely 
of tricks. Nearly all the tricks we 
know are incorporated in it 
somewhere.” 

She laughed. “Where is it? We 
didn’t find it when we checked the 
station.” 

“You probably thought it was 
just ballast.” 

“Exactly what is it?” 

“A mixture of simulation and 
illusion and a little reality. For a 
few hours you’ll be on Earth, in 
circumstances I know but you 
don’t. It’s better if you don’t know. 



80 



IF 




Often when we use it ourselves, we 
have someone else set the program 
for us.” 

“The station is small. There 
can’t be much room for this 
Wonderland.” 

“More than you’d think. A 
certain mass is necessary for 
various reasons. If we didn’t have 
a Wonderland, the space it takes 
up would be filled with ballast.” 

“What’s it for?” 

“Mainly to help keep us sane. To 
stop us from feeling too 
homesick.” 

She was becoming curious. If 
Wonderland simulated conditions 
on Earth it was her duty to visit it. 

They went up from the living 
quarters in a slow elevator. 

“How many can be in 
Wonderland at once?” she asked. 

“Two at most settings. Four in 
some simple, static scenes. Only 
one in some complicated 
simulations.” 

“And we just walk in? No 
preparation?” 

“Usually we change our clothes. 
That’s all. Wonderland does the 
rest.” 

The elevator stopped. They 
emerged in a blank steel corridor 
facing a double door. Beyond the 
door was a small totally bare room 
with two more doors. 

“Go in there and change,” said 
Hugh. ‘Then come out.” 

Pariss found herself in a cubicle. 
Set out for her in front of a chute, 
with automated neatness, was a 



curious collection of garments: a 
blue insulated suit with a hood, 
boots with skates and a collection 
of equipment the purpose of which 
she had to guess. 

It was going to be cold. There 
would be snow and ice. She was 
used to this. Eden was a cold world 
except on the artificial islands. 

She changed quickly and picked 
up the strange equipment she was 
evidently supposed to take with 
her. Then she left the cubicle. 

“Like it?” Hugh asked. 

She was dazzled by the bright 
sun on the sparkling snow. Over to 
the left, about a thousand meters 
away, was a forest of green spiky 
trees. In front of her the ground fell 
gently to a frozen lake. To the right 
were blue mountains hazy with 
distance. 

She caught her breath— and not 
from the cold. The air was clean 
and invigorating. Her breath froze 
and drifted away slowly, indicat- 
ing hardly any wind. 

“How is it done?’’ she 
murmured. 

“Oh, don’t bother about that. 
Can you skate?” 

The illusion, if such it was, was 
perfect. The snow was crisp and 
new, with no footprints but their 
own. The sky was clear light blue. 

They left their skis by the 
changing rooms — which looked 
part of an Alpine hut — and trudged 
down to the lake, where they 
helped each other to put on skates. 

Pariss skated well, but slightly 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



81 




to her chagrin Hugh skated better. 
The Terran attitude toward snow 
and ice was new to her. On Eden 
they were an inconvenience and all 
paths and roads were kept 
completely clear. Children and 
adults exercised and trained in the 
snow, but only young children 
played in it. One skated to get 
somewhere or for exercise, not for 
fun. 

She enjoyed skating with Hugh 
and soon learned some of his 
techniques. Previously she would 
have seen no point in skating 
backward or on one skate only 
except when changing over to the 
other. 

Hugh also learned quietly from 
what was new to Pariss. - 

If there should be war between 
Terrans and Adamites, on the 
surface of worlds, it was important 
to know where the Adamites held 
an advantage. They might strike 
first at Northern Canada, Alaska, 
Russia, even the polar caps — if 
they had been applying technology 
to snow and ice for centuries while 
Earth people for the most part had 
merely played in it or waited for a 
thaw. 

F or the first time, as she 
smoothed on the long gold 
dress she next found in the chang- 
ing cubicle, Pariss had a fleeting 
glimpse of what clothes meant to 
Terran women. But the feeling was 
gone in a flash, 

Once again she gasped in wonder 



and admiration as she emerged, 
this time into a brightly lit 
ballroom in which scores of people 
were dancing. 

This, she knew at once, was a 
Grand Ball, a great occasion, 

The music was strange to her 
ears, although she had listened 
dutifully to taped Terran music. 
The beat, however, was obvious — 
one, two, three, one, two, three. 
This was what they called a waltz. 
The magnificently dressed dancers 
were bobbing gracefully in simple 
steps which Pariss, a good dancer, 
was able to pick up in a few sec- 
onds. 

The men were all in black and 
white, the women in all the colors 
of the rainbow. Hugh appeared, 
dressed like the other men in a 
black suit with a dazzling white 
shirt and a white tie. 

“May I have the pleasure?” he 
asked. 

The illusion was nearly perfect. 
Once or twice she tried to touch the 
other dancers, but they always 
moved gently away. 

“Those drinks they’re carrying 
can’t be real,” she said. 

“No, but you can have one if you 
like.” 

“How?” 

“I’ll show you.” 

He went to the buffet and 
returned with two glasses. She 
noticed that people moved easily 
out of his way. 

She drank and danced with 
Hugh again, less successfully. 



82 



IF 




because the steps were more 
elaborate than those of the waltz. 

She turned down Hugh’s invita- 
tion to go out on the balcony. She 
was not sure what she would do if 
he became even friendlier. 

So they went back to the doors 
from which they had emerged and 
once again she was in the bare 
changing cubicle. 

The clothes she found this time 
were unexpected. After the snow 
and the ballroom, she had expected 
the next scene to be even more 
glamorous and probably aphrodis- 
iac — perhaps a luxury apartment 
high above a city, late at night, 
with wine and supper. She was hun- 
gry and would have welcomed the 
supper. 

But the clothes she found were 
coarse trousers and tunic, with 
underclothes so plain and 
utilitarian she knew there could be 
no glamor in the next scene. 

She dressed and hesitated, reluc- 
tant this time to go out, 
remembering that after all Hugh 
was — or might consider himself to 
be — an enemy. 

H aving gone so far, Wil Slent 
would budge no further. Two 
hundred and one Adamites had 
been killed. Two hundred and one 
Terrans had to die. And since it 
would be impossible to establish 
the identity of all the assassins, the 
two hundred and one would be 
selected at random, every twenty- 
fifth name on the personnel list in 



alphabetical order, excluding only 
those under eighteen. 

The execution of two hundred 
Terrans must go on. 

It did. 

It was done as humanely as pos- 
sible. The Terrans were sent, to 
lunch one day in groups of two 
hundred. One group was never seen 
again. 

Among those who were executed 
were General Morrison, whose 
name was selected at random from 
the list, and the wife of the chief 
medical officer. Nils Hakstrott. 
Previously he, like Stewart, had 
been as neutral as possible in the 
circumstances, prepared to sit out 
the Adamite occupation. When his 
wife, who was at least half the 
taciturn Scandinavian’s life, was 
executed—the gentle Delise had 
been the last person among the five 
thousand Terrans likely to kill any 
human being under any 
circumstances — Nils Hakstrott 
decided coldly that he personally 
was going to avenge her. 

T he Out warders were friendly 
in an earthy way and Red was 
typical. The women accepted 
Verne with neither enthusiasm nor 
resentment. She was there — and 
that was that. The men made crude 
advances, which stopped abruptly 
when Red made it clear she was 
already claimed. 

She was given a desk and told to 
copy a plan. It was an apparently 
easy job with several pitfalls. She

did her very best and her boss, a 
vast man called Eric Manvin, was 
satisfied and said so. 

He showed his satisfaction by 
putting her at once on a difficult 
job, a defense network soon to be 
established against raids by the 
gnomes and hemmers. It consisted 
of a central fort and a series of 
boundary outposts linked to the 
fort by both surface and 
underground tunnels. The 
specifications and requirements 
were supplied and it was up to her 
to solve the many problems. 

She worked with three men and 
two women. The range of work was 
immense; everything that required 
plans was handled here. 

At the first break for* coffee she 
told Eric, “I’ve met your brother.’’ 
“Fred?” ' 

“We were on the road in the 
gale, my father and I. He came out 
for us. He saved our lives.” 

Eric seemed reluctant to talk 
about Fred. Presently he said, 
“Fred doesn’t have all his onions, 
girl.” 

“All his what?” 

“You know. There’s something 
missing in him. Ma was nearly 
killed by a hemmer while she was 
carrying him. Doctors say that 
shouldn’t have anything to do with 
it, but 1 don’t know. Fred’s scared 
of nothing but hemmers’” 

Verne thought of the stocky bluff 
gateman. As she formed a casual 
mental contact she became aware 
of something urgent. 



She didn’t stop to think. “The 
gate!” she exclaimed. 

She whirled to claw at the door 
and found Eric there before her. 
“Fred?” he asked. 

They ran. The gate was perhaps 
three hundred meters from the 
drawing office. On the way they 
collected three other men. One had 
a shotgun. 

When they burst into the 
gatehouse a hemmer was sucking 
the last drop of blood from the 
body of Fred Manvin. The 
hemmer was about the size of a 
large dog and roughly the same 
shape, but the six legs and head 
were amorphous, like those of the 
gnomes. The long tongue was the 
hemmer’s strike weapon. 

The shotgun went off over 
Verne’s shoulder. The hemmer, not 
disabled, turned and lashed at Eric 
with its tongue. Eric sawed 
savagely and successfully in the air 
with his knife. The tip of the 
tongue, almost severed, dripped 
blood — Fred’s blood. 

The four men knew what to do. 
The man with the shotgun threw it 
away. They fell on the hemmer 
with knives and whatever heavy 
objects came to hand — clubs, a 
lamp, a steel rod. 

They beat the hemmer to a pulp.' 
That this was necessary was shown 
by its struggles and the vicious 
lashing of its tongue after its 
owner should have been dead. 
There was red blood and green 
blood. The red blood was Fred’s^

IF 




the green the hemmer’s. 

The creature was reduced to 
small green-brown balls. One of 
the men looked around and found a 
small blowlamp which he applied 
to the residue. It did not burn easily 
and tended to roll away. He rolled 
all the balls outside, turned up the 
flame and incinerated them. Only a 
little black dust was left. 

Eric was looking down at Fred, a 
strange expression on his face. He 
showed no sorrow. What he felt 
Verne thought, was shame. 

“Poor Fred,” said Eric. “He was 
never afraid of anything but 
hemmers.” 

After Fred’s bloodless corpse 
had been taken away to be disposed 
of, Eric and the other men looked 
around to see where the hemmer 
had come from — an important 
matter, Verne understood. They 
found a small gap in the fence near 
the gate, where something heavy 
had been dashed violently in the 
storm. 

“That’s it,” Eric said, “The 
beast saw the gap, crept through, 
waited behind the gatehouse until 
Fred opened the door, then jumped 
him. It had the sense to kill him 
inside where nobody could see what 
was going on,” It was only then 
that he reverted to the most 
remarkable feature of the affair, 
“How did you know, girl?” he 
asked, fixing her with his hard 
gaze. 

Verne could tell him only a part 
of the truth. 



“I’ve never seen a hemmer 
before,” she said, “but I think I 
can tell when they’re about.” 

To her relief, Eric nodded. 
“Some people have claimed the 
gift — usually about gnomes. But 
you can’t sense gnomes, can you? 
You once walked in on one.” 

“Now I might be able to.” 

He shook his head. “Don’t count 
on it, girl. Anyone I ever heard of 
who claimed to be able to sense 
gnomes or hemmers was killed by 
one or the other. Maybe it works 
sometimes. When you start 
thinking it always works you get 
careless and—” He made a 
gruesome sucking noise, looked at 
her curiously. He had shown not 
one sign of grief over Fred. 
“Things happen around you, girl. 
Be careful. You’re a good 
draftsman. I don’t want to lose 
you.” 

T wice Pariss had emerged into 
a blaze of light. This time she 
found herself in a world of 
blackness, sudden flashes, noise 
and menace. 

Hugh caught her arm. She could 
scarcely see him. A searchlight 
flicked on, then off. She had a 
glimpse of tall buildings all around 
her. The droning she had noted 
almost unconsciously came from 
the sky. The crumps which vibrated 
the air about her ears and shook 
the ground under her feet could 
only be explosions. 

As her eyes became accustomed 

85 



THE REAL PEOPLE 




to the scene she discovered that 
there was really a good deal of 
light, particularly to her left, 
where a red glow lit the sky. And as 
her ears learned to discriminate she 
found that the street was not 
deserted, as she had thought. Many 
people were scurrying in the black 
shadows. 

A man in a steel helmet emerged 
from the gloom, clearly visible as 
the red glow over the rooftops 
suddenly swelled to flames. 

“Get off the street,” he yelled. 
“What the hell do you think you’re 
doing?” 

Pariss and Hugh sought shadows 
and found a narrow opening, a 
mere lane. They hurried along it, 
more to get away frorn the bawling 
man than anything else. As they 
went, they heard him shouting at 
somebody else. 

At the other end of the lane they 
found themselves in a more open 
space. Abruptly all was brightly 
lit — at least a score of searchlights 
came on, searching for and finding 
a dark winged shape droning over 
the city. They saw bombs drop. 
Then the bomber changed course 
and the searchlights lost it. They 
caught a smaller plane, evidently 
one of the defenders, for the lights 
flicked off again and the darkness 
seemed ten times greater than 
before. 

“Where are we?” she asked. 

“In London in an air raid. Not 
contemporary. This was centuries 
ago. 



-Why—” 

A building no more than two 
hundred meters away opened out 
and collapsed and Hugh threw her 
to the ground. There was no flash, 
but the noise deafened Pariss. She 
hit the ground and Hugh landed 
heavily on top of her. She was 
angry— this was only play-acting. 

However, as her back was spat- 
tered with small stones and she felt 
a fierce blast of hot air over her, 
she wasn’t so sure. 

“This is a hot spot,” said Hugh, 
pulling her to her feet. “Let’s get 
out of it.” 

She tried to protest, but he was 
dragging her so fast she had to save 
her breath for running. 

They came to a blazing store. 
Firemen were hosing the buildings 
nearby, ignoring the doomed 
structure. In the street were scores 
of dazed people in nightclothes, 
some grotesquely wearing steel 
helmets and pajamas, most 
carrying gas masks. A child dashed 
at Pariss and then dodged away. 

A breath of wind sighed along 
the street and the next moment 
they were drenched in cold water. 
The water supply for the hoses had 
suddenly been cut and the weak jets 
were blown back on the 
firefighters. The water, at least, 
was real. 

The droning swelled. As search- 
lights stabbed the sky again Pariss 
caught glimpses of whole waves of 
bombers. 

The heat from the fire was burn- 



86 



IF 




ing her face. Although she still re- 
sented the futility of this 
demonstration, she turned and ran 
to the other side of the street as she 
heard a child wailing. 

She didn't find the child and she 
lost Hugh. 

The blazing building suddenly 
collapsed into the street, a 
terrifying sight, engulfing the 
firemen and the homeless people in 
blazing rubble. 

Not believing in the still 
flickering debris in front of her, she 
started to approach it to prove to 
herself it was illusion. The heat 
drove her back. 

Still annoyed with Hugh, she 
decided to make her way back, 
leaving him to follow. There would 
be a door, as usual, looking like a 
typical door in this beleaguered 
city, but opening into the cubicle. 

She could not find the way back. 
When she thought she had found 
the lane, it proved to be the wrong 
lane. Instead of retracing her steps 
she tried to find the street they had 
started from. Soon she was 
hopelessly lost. 

Because she was uneasy, hungry, 
wet and cold and because she was 
alone and could see no way out of 
this ghastly illusion she began to 
curse Hugh. It had been pleasant 
and interesting to skate, to dance. 
What pleasure was there in this? 

When she was approaching 
despair, for the noise alone made 
her want to scream, she realized 
she was in a place very like the 



street where the man in the tin hat 
had shouted at her and Hugh. She 
searched all around for the door 
out of this tortured city. 

She could not find it. No door 
would open for her. Trying to 
remember exactly what had 
happened when she first found 
herself in this whirl of destruction, 
she could be sure of nothing except 
that Hugh had guided her. Without 
him she was lost. 

As she turned from another 
doorknob which almost certainly 
led nowhere anyway, she bumped 
into someone. 

“Pariss!" said Hugh. “What 
happened to you when the building 
collapsed?” 

“Never mind that. Let’s get out 
of here.” 

Still angry with him, she was 
torn between relief at finding him, 
the desire to flare at him and 
impatience to escape from this 
mad, hellish world. The last was 
most important. Telling him what 
she thought of him could wait. 

“We can’t leave at this moment. 
We’ve got to go through that lane 
and it’s blocked.” 

“Get me out of here!” she said, 
not loudly, but with passion. 

“The raid will be over in an hour 
or less. Then it’ll be easy to get 
back where we started. I’ve found a 
workmen’s hut. We can wait 
there. This way.” 

Her nerves were in rags. She 
wanted to scream at him. 

A door opened. She was led

inside. A match scraped and she 
saw the inside of the hut. 

In one corner was a spade, in an- 
other a pick. Hugh was lighting an 
oil lamp. Two small windows had 
black material draped over them. 
On the bare boards of the floor lay 
a thin paillasse. Two chipiped ipugs, 
an old kettle, a small stove and a 
spoon lay on an inverted fishbox. 
There was nothing else. 

She exploded hysterically. She 
didn’t know what she said. For the 
first time she lost some of her per- 
fect English and used Adamite 
words. 

Hugh smiled and she threw her- 
self at him. He caught her wrists 
and kissed her and suddenly she 
admitted what she had known all 
along, that she wanted this man. 

All that mattered was: did he 
care about her as something other 
than an Adamite adversary. If he 
remained coldly calculating she 
would punish him. 

It was she who dragged him 
down. He was startled, then 
enthusiastically cooperative. She 
said what was in her mind. 

“Forget I’m an Adamite. If you 
don’t care about me as a woman 
I’ll kill you.” 

F ull contact was made after 
five exploratory efforts. It was 
easy to arrange full concentration 
in the two stations, but Gilen and 
Don had difficulty making sure 
they would be alone and 
undisturbed — and Verne could be 



in Sal’s company only in the 
presence of other patients. 

TOMl—W\\—Fort Plato: 
There is a very serious situ- 
ation here, tragic and pos- 
sibly disastrous [Details of 
massacre and reprisals]. A 
strong line must be taken 
with the Terrans on all 
fronts. 

VERNE— S^[—Out^^:ard: 
Nonsense. How can we take 
a strong line here? Tomi, 
are you sure the execution 
of the Terrans was neces- 
sary? 

TOMI: Wil took the de- 
cision. He felt he had no 
choice. 

GILEN — Don — Munch- 
en: We are in the Terrans’ 
hands. We are almost Jielp- 
less. It may be necessary to 
request permission to use 
our special abilities if we 
are to achieve anything at 
all. 

PARISS— Far — Station 
692: Hugh, and I [com- 
munication not in words]. 

TOMI, VERNE, GILEN: 
[Shock, alarm, interest.] 

TOMI: Are you sure you 
haven’t been tricked, Pariss? 

PARISS: Perhaps. It’s of 
no consequence. 

TOMI: No consequence! 
When you hold a secret 
that — 

PARISS: I don’t care 



88 



IF 




about that now. Hugh has 
quite considerable telepathic 
potential, but there is no 
risk whatever that he will de- 
velop further without being 
trained. I could train him, I 
think — 

TOMl: Pariss, you must 
not! 

PARISS: Oh, I won’t. 
Don’t get the idea I’ve 
changed sides. 

GILEN: We are no long- 
er together. We have lost 
our bond. 

VERNE: That’s natural. 
Experience must change us 
— and our present experi- 
ences are very different. To- 
mi, it’s a great pity such de- 
cisive and irrevocable action 
has been taken. 

PARISS: Especially with- 
out consultation. It may 
mean ruin. 

VERNE: I find Terrans 
pretty good people. I have 
found no reason to fight 
them. Here on Outward the 
settlers are totally indiffer- 
ent to Eden. From my ex- 
periences, I have no reason 
to back any Adamite ag- 
gression against Terrans. 

GILEN: I think perhaps 
only by fighting could we 
get what we want. But I 
think we would lose . 

TOMI: We must try to 
agree. There must be an 
answer . 



VERNE: How can we 
agree on an answer when the 
problems are not the same? 

T he rivulets mingled with more 
turbulence than ever before. 
Verne was the most decisive, the 
most positive. Gilen was the most 
tentative. Pariss was the most 
complex; the others sensed her 
conflict and at the same time a 
new serenity and smugness in her 
that irritated them. Tomi, once 
she found that a strong line in her 
post was favored by nobody, be- 
gan to question Wil’s action more 
than she had done previously. She 
broke the contact because she 
wanted to think. 

VII 

F ort Plato was seething. The 
executions had united the Ter- 
rans as nothing else could have 
done. 

Previously there had been many 
cautious spirits. The retaliatory 
executions, in which by rough 
Terran estimate about ten guerillas 
had been included with one 
hundred and ninety innocent 
people, changed all that. 

On the face of it, how the Ter- 
rans felt had ceased to matter. 
They were now treated as a 
conquered garrison. When not 
working or eating they were locked 
in their rooms. Large-scale plotting 
was made virtually impossible. 
The replacement Adamites, who 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



89 




had not known the easy mingling of 
the first few days, were tough 
jailers. To them the Terrans were 
dangerous and treacherous ene- 
mies. 

When a small Terran group went 
berserk, a dozen men rushing a sin- 
gle Adamite, he did not shoot to 
kill. There was no more killing. He 
stunned them and the offenders 
were taken off in a tender to the 
Adamite ship, which no Terran had 
ever been allowed to visit and 
return. 

HEN Dr. MHler returned to 
Miinchen a message from 
Miss Heilbron was waiting for him. 

Dear Dr. Miller:- . 

Please come and see me 
immediately. It’s vitally im- 
portant. 

Naturally I cannot act 
without first seeing you. 

Yours faithfully, 
Margaret Heilbron 

He smiled a wintry smile. 

She had a flat near the 
Prinzregententheater, He knew 
the address but had never been 
there. She opened the door to him 
herself. The warmth of her 
welcome took him aback. 

Searching suspiciously for irony 
in her attitude as she brought him a 
drink, he admitted reluctantly to 
himself that possibly her 
friendliness was genuine. She 
lounged easily and elegantly on 



the arm of a chair, a drink in her 
hand. 

“Do you remember the purser 
on the Nora? The report on him? 

“Very well. I read it a dozen 
times. Norman Gliick.” 

“Good. He seems to have missed 
a trip for medical reasons and had 
to be cleared medically. The 
doctors became interested in the 
psychriatric angle — ” 

“So were we all,” said Miller. 
“But he refused to cooperate.” 

“Ah, you weren’t in the 
fortunate position of being his 
employers. The company doctors 
refused to pass him until he 
completed any treatment they 
chose. Now it seems his vehement 
insistence on certain ‘facts’ has 
convinced the doctors that they 
must be untrue.” 

Miller nodded. “That he 
harbored certain emotional beliefs 
was obvious.” 

“The man and the girl we are in- 
terested in were not on the ship 
when it started from Hylon. They 
were not on it a week out of 
Miinchen. They were on it six days 
out.” 

“The ship didn’t stop in space?” 
“Impossible. I mean, if there 
had been some kind of rendezvous 
in space, even one nobody saw or 
remembered afterward, the time 
and fuel schedules would reveal it. 
That is, unless a ship nobody saw 
matched velocity with the Nord 
and somehow managed a 
transfer.”

“Thank you, Miss Heilbron. 
You’ve given me a key.” 

“To what?” 

“To open a door, obviously.” He 
could reach her phone without get- 
ting up. He used it to send a wire to 
The Great Nicolas. Its purport 
was: IVe need you. Please come, 

W HEN Sal Slent left the hos- 
pital he took Fred Manvin’s 
job as gatekeeper for the time be- 
ing. Great mobility was not re- 
quired. 

Verne remained with Red, 
although she could have moved in 
with one of the single women. She 
continued to keep him at arm’s 
length. She knew that coarse jokes 
were being made about the 
situation. Red was surprisingly 
and uncharacteristically tolerant 
of the ribbing. He made no secret 
of his determination to have Verne 
in the end. 

She found it hard even to be sure 
she liked him. She went on living in 
his house principally because she 
was used to him. Only once, when 
he came home drunk, did he try to 
force himself on her. She 
dislocated his shoulder with a judo 
lock he had never encountered. He 
bore no malice; everyone had a 
right to defend himself — or her- 
self. Anyway, she put the shoulder 
back in place for him. 

They met after work each day 
and went home together. This 
became habit and, one day when 
Red was delayed a little, Verne 



found she didn’t want to go home 
without him. She waited outside 
although quite heavy rain was 
falling. When he appeared he 
seemed surprised she had waited. 

“Sorry, baby,’’ he said. “I 
couldn’t help it. Busy. Don’t bawl 
me out.” 

“I never bawl you out.” 

“No, you don’t, do you? 
except when I swear.” 

“Swearing is untidy. It’s not 
washing your face or not putting 
on a clean shirt.” 

“Never thought of it that way, 
baby. Look, I got a haunch of 
steak. Not tinned steak. Frozen, 
but thawing out nicely now. We’re 
going to have the best dinner 
we’ve had in months.” 

She expressed natural interest. 
“Where did it come from?” 

“Base settlement up north has 
started a cattle farm. It hasn’t been 
tried before because everybody 
thought the gnomes and hemmers 
would go for the cattle — and it’s a 
big enough job protecting animals 
from the climate without trying to 
protect them from gnomes and 
hemmers as well. But finally some 
cattle were brought in and the 
gnomes ignore them. So do the 
hemmers.” 

“That’s strange.” 

“Maybe not. We’ve never 
managed to keep a gnome in 
captivity — they either get away or 
kill themselves. But we know that 
for meat they eat only humans or 
other gnomes.” 



THE REAL PEOPLE

Verne shuddered. Eden had no 
history of cannibalism, and she 
found the idea even more shocking 
than Terrans did. 

“Seems that — like some canni- 
bals in our own history — they be- 
lieve you become what you eat.” 
They reached the house and were 
soaked to the skin. 

Verne hesitated. 

Red looked at her inquiringly. 
“Red,” she said quietly, “there’s 
something in the house.” 

Red was instantly alert. 
“Hemmer?” 

“I don’t know.” 

He took a whistle from his 
pocket, the general alarm. “Want 
me to blow this?” 

“No — I’m not sure enough.” 

He nodded. When there was an 
alarm in Camp Eleven everybody 
dropped everything and ran to the 
spot. If it was a false alarm the 
people responsible looked uncom- 
monly foolish. 

“I’ll get a gun,” Red said and 
moved to the alarm post only 
twenty yards away. 

“It’s a gnome,” she said. “The 
same one.” 

“You don’t know for sure there’s 
anything there — but you know it’s 
the same one?” 

Red’s tone was not mocking. He 
was genuinely seeking information, 
at least clarification of her hunch. 

“It couldn’t be the same one, 
could it? The house was checked 
top and bottom after — ” 

“Gnomes are cunning, baby, and 



yours hates you. Maybe he found 
another way back. We have 
to have ventilation, and gomes can 
flow like water. You stay behind 
me. 

He opened the front door no 
more quietly nor loudly than his 
custom, strode in as usual. 

“Kitchen,” Verne whispered. 

Red kicked the kitchen door 
open, not entering the room. 

The gnome was in the center of 
the floor as before. Its arms lashed 
out, hit the walls on each side of the 
doorway. Gnomes tended to flail 
rather than project their arms. 
Except for the split-second de- 
lay, the gnome might have reached 
Red. 

Red blasted the creature and 
moved closer, cutting it up with 
his beam. It took a long time to 
die. The killing was messier than 
that of the hemmer. Pieces of 
gnome were not harmless like 
those of the other murderous 
species. If they happened to have 
a few brain cells the pieces went on 
fighting. 

After the gnome was killed the 
kitchen had to be cleaned. When 
the job was done, Verne said, 
“Let’s put the steak away for to- 
night, Red. I couldn’t eat it. I 
couldn’t even cook it.” 

Red nodded understandingly. 

Verne suddenly sensed strong- 
ly that Red loved her. Her courage 
in the previous encounter with 
the gnome had won him over com- 
pletely — since then he had acted as 



92 



IF 




he had never acted before, wait- 
ing patiently for her because he 
was completely certain that she 
was worth waiting for. 

And Verne discovered in a 
blinding flash the difference it 
made to a girl to know that she was 
loved. 

She held out her arms to him. 

44¥'D TELL you anything, 

A Hugh,” Pariss said, troubled, 
“if it didn’t make me a traitress.” 

He nodded. They were lying 
naked on a sunny beach in Won- 
derland. This was not only the 
most romantic setting they had 
been able to find — it was also the 
most private. 

“You’re worried,” he said. “You 
feel something’s gone wrong. 
Look, Pariss— I don’t want to 
make you betray your people. If 
you did that, they’d execute you, 
wouldn’t they?” 

“Yes. But I might not be there to 
let them do it.” 

He thought that over for a long 
time. At last he said “I see. I’m 
glad. The trouble is — we might 
execute you.” 

“If I chose to stay?” 

“Well, it would depend on what 
had happened. You said there 
were four echelons. Pariss, I can 
be pretty impartial. Maybe I 
can help. Don’t betray your peo- 
ple, but tell me what’s worrying 
you.” 

“Yes, I will. In Fort Plato, two 
hundred Terrans and two hun- 



dred Adamites have died. And not 
in battle.” 

“That’s bad,” said Hugh quiet- 

ly- 

“It’s very bad. I know.” 

“Can you tell me how?” 

“Oh, revolt and reprisal. The 
Terrans killed first.” 

Hugh sat up, staring out across 
the unreal sea. “That may help. 
You’ve told me the truth about the 
purpose of this operation? You 
just want to find out about us?” 

She was silent. 

“So there’s more.” 

She sat up too, suddenly 
clutching his arm. “Hugh, I want 
to tell you. If I could only believe 
it was for the good of all of us — ” 
“Can’t you tell me about the 
three other parts of this opera- 
tion? We’re bound to learn about 
them in the end. Isn’t that so?” 

She nodded. 

At first hesitantly, then more 
freely, she told him of the quad- 
ruplets — Wil, Far, Don and 
Sal — and about Wil’s quadruplet 
daughters: Tomi, Gilen, Verne 
and herself. 

Hugh listened quietly, asking 
hardly any questions. 

“So that was the background at 
Fort Plato,” he said at last. “Your 
father acted exactly as your un- 
cle did here. There was no proper 
Adamite control. The massacre 
happened because it was allowed 
to happen. Pariss, you’re head- 
ing for failure — catastrophic 
failure.”

He spoke with such conviction 
that she went suddenly pale. 
“Failure?” 

“I could take this station over 
again in one hour.” 

“You swear that, Hugh? It’s not 
a trick? But why are you telling 
me?” 

“Because,” he said slowly, “I’m 
going to save you if I can.” 

C ontact was easier now that 
Sal was out of the hospital. 

VERNE — Sal — Out- 
ward: I’ve gone a step fur- 
ther than Pariss. I’ve married 
Red. 

TOMI—W\\—Fort Plato: 
Verne, you’re crazy! - 

VERNE: Maybe. Wasn’t 
it a lot crazier to execute 
two hundred Terrans? 

TOMI: Perhaps. Stewart 
thinks I should have stopped 
that somehow. Anyway, 
we’re clamping down now. 

PARISS — Far — Sta- 
tion 692: Hasn’t there been 
too much clamping down al- 
ready? Hugh says he’s scared 
to think about what’s going 
to happen on Fort Plato. 

TOMI. GILEN, VERNE: 
You’ve told him? You’ve 
told him everything? 

PARISS: No. Not about 
our main aim. But he has 
told me many things. We’ll 
all be lucky just to escape. 
TOMI: Nonsense. These 



Terrans aren’t so marvelous. 

GILEN: For my part, I 
would be prepared to leave 
now. 

PARIS. VERNE. TOMI: 
Without the seed? 

GILEN: If you let us 
make a maximum effort, we 
might escape with the seed. 

TOMI: Wait. Wait. This 
is panic. Our control here is 
absolute — 

PARISS: That’s what you 
think. 

TOMI: Pariss, find out 
all you can, but do not touch 
Hugh’s mind. Gilen, plan to 
steal what we want, if neces- 
sary by maximum effort, but 
don’t act until I give the 
word. Verne — 

VERNE: Yes, shy virgin. 
What advice for me? 

TOMI: None. 

I T WAS only a convenient pre- 
tense that Stewart, Terran liai- 
son officer after the death of Gen- 
eral Morrison, had any real au- 
thority. The Adamites were able 
to bring minor offenders before 
him and, as often as not, he was 
permitted to decide what was to be 
done. Leaders of the various sec- 
tions into which the Terrans had 
been divided reported to him regu- 
larly. 

A girl who reported on the steno- 
grapher section gave him a paper 
to sign and with it was a small slip, 
reading: 



94 



IF 




YOU WILL BE HURT BY AN ELE- 
VATOR DOOR. DO NOT LET THE 

STRANGERS TREAT YOU. 

The girl made a slight gesture 
and he understood he was to eat the 
paper at the earliest opportunity. 

His reaction was mainly exas- 
peration. The first plot had been 
disastrous. The massacres had 
accomplished nothing to the 
advantage of anyone. Here was 
another melodramatic plan. 

It was not difficult to get the 
crumpled rice paper into his 
mouth with a peppermint and 
swallow it. 

Two hours later, going for lunch, 
he had to descend two floors. He 
had a strong impulse to use the 
stairs. However, he would prob- 
ably not be allowed to evade this 
thing even if he wanted to. He took 
the elevator. 

He entered with no trouble and 
was rather hoping the plan had al- 
ready collapsed. When his floor 
was reached he was gently but 
firmly pushed back by the others in 
the elevator, so that he was last to 
emerge. The gate closed on his 
foot. 

He tried to cry out exactly as he 
would have done if he had had no 
warning at all. Two Adamite 
guards turned quickly and brought 
up their guns. The door slid open 
again. He pitched forward. 

The Adamites knew who he was. 
They called their own medical offi- 
cer to attend to him. 



Stewart’s foot was badly 
bruised, but not seriously crushed. 

A Terran clinic orderly turned 
up, looked at the foot casually and 
said Stewart should go to the clinic. 

The three Adamites spoke no 
English between them. They sent 
for an interpreter. Tomi came. 

“Very funny, isn’t it?” Stewart 
asked. 

Tomi, who had not smiled, start- 
ed in surprise. A quality Stewart 
had not previously revealed was 
peevishness. 

Stewart’s tactics succeeded ad- 
mirably. Instead of being symp- 
athetic, instead of insisting that 
he get the best Adamite care, she 
shrugged and left him to his bad 
temper and the Terran clinic. 

For two hours after he reached 
the clinic nothing happened that 
was not entirely routine. His foot 
was treated. The two Adamite 
guards in the clinic seldom entered 
the two small wards. 

At last the chief medical officer. 
Nils Hakstrott, came to see him. 
Hakstrott said, “Sorry, Stewart, 
but we had to get you in here 
somehow. The last gesture of 
defiance, I presume you agree, was 
cretinous. This one is designed to 
defeat the Adamites utterly.” 

At Stewart’s inquiring look he 
explained: “Oh, yes, we can talk 
here. These clinics are prefabri- 
cated, so the scanners were added 
afterward. The one in here has been 
out of order for three months and 
we’ve made sure the Adamites 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



95 




never had a chance to install one 
of their own. Stewart, I want you 
to understand first of all that the 
present scheme is worlds apart 
from the earlier one. All the top 
men except yourself have already 
been consulted. It’s a plan, not a 
pious hope.” 

“With the object of recapturing 
Fort Plato?” 

“Yes. Their ship may attack us 
in retaliation, but we hope to be 
ready for that.” 

“The facts, please.” 

“Yes. Perhaps you don’t know 
it, but I was formerly in Chemical 
Warfare.” 

Stewart had not known — and 
that was good, because it meant 
few people did. .. 

“Before the unfortunate massa- 
cre I had ideas of my own — they 
had come to nothing. But now, the 
Adamites have murdered my wife. 
Perhaps you wonder if 1 can be 
trusted to be rational. Well, rather 
to my personal disappointment, 
the plan does not involve the death 
of many Adamites, maybe none.” 

Stewart merely nodded. 

“I managed to examine and test 
several of the Adamite devices they 
rely on to ensure that the air is not 
tampered with, the water, their 
food. Quite effective, all of them. 
They would give the alarm at once. 
But every such device is a chal- 
lenge.” 

“And you’ve found a way to beat 
the devices?” 

Hakstrott was not to be hurried. 



“There’s a way of buffering 
drugs,” he said ruminatively, “to 
delay their effect and make it 
cumulative. You take them at two 
o’clock and they don’t even begin 
to work until six. When you start 
assimilating them, nothing hap- 
pens. The drug continues to build 
up until, perhaps, you have a le- 
thal dose inside you and you still 
don’t keel over. Using certain 
drugs and certain buffering 
agents, 1 can arrange that the vic- 
tims will suspect nothing — be- 
cause there are no symptoms — un- 
til what seems like ordinary 
fatigue overwhelms them.” 

“And this is the treatment you 
prescribe for the Adamites?” 

“Yes. The difficulty is making 
sure they’ll take it.” 

“1 can see that might be a diffi- 
culty.” 

“Our only practical solution is to 
take it with them.” 

“That’s practical?” 

“1 told you 1 examined their 
warning devices. We can’t directly 
contaminate their food supplies. 
Naturally they thought of that. But 
we can drug the water and their 
devices won’t detect the drug.” 
“How far has this gone?” Stew- 
art asked. “And exactly why am 1 
being consulted?” 

“You are to approve,” said Hak- 
'strott gently. 

“I am to approve. Mind if 1 ask 
why?” 

“So that we are all in this to- 
gether. Unlike the idiocy. How 



96 



IF 




far has it gone? It can be set in 
motion at any time.’’ 

“And the chances of success?’’ 

“Excellent. The drug will be ad- 
ministered in the water used for 
cooking and -the water from which 
beverages are prepared. The 
schedule will be such that people 
will get tired at just about the time 
when they would normally expect 
to get tired.’’ 

“I see.’’ And Stewart did see. As 
Hakstrott claimed, this plan was 
quite different from the guerillas’ 
revolt. 

To annoy a dangerous enemy 
without incapacitating him only 
made future action more difficult, 
perhaps impossible. 

To defeat a dangerous enemy 
with one stroke was a brilliant suc- 
cess. 

Adamites were predictable. They 
still judged Terrans by themselves. 

Without prompting, Stewart was 
able to see the further implications 
of the plan. Of course the night- 
shift Adamites would be asleep and 
would not be affected. Fortunately 
the Adamites, like Terrans, kept 
only a skeleton staff on night duty. 
It was the duty of the day-staff 
Adamites to enforce the curfew, 
herd the Terrans in the fort into 
their night quarters, lock them up 
and hand over to the small night 
staff of about seventy a battened- 
down station, secure and easy to 
guard. 

If Hakstrott’s plan worked, the 
seventy night-duty Adamites 



would emerge into a fort com- 
pletely under Terran control. 
“Yes,’’ said Stewart. 

“What do you mean, yes?’’ 

“I mean I agree.’’ 

“I’m glad. I don’t know what I’d 
have done if you hadn’t’’ 

T here was no need for them to 
whisper, hut they did, knowing 
Gilen and Don Slent were in the 
next room. 

“Even with you and Mrs. Gru- 
meyer as close as this, you think 
they sense nothing?’’ Miller mur- 
mured. 

“We don’t,’’ said The Great Ni- 
colas, “so probably they don’t’’ 
Grumeyer carefully set his little 
crystal device. In drab, inconspic- 
uous clothes, Nick and his gla- 
morous wife would never have 
rated a second glance. 

Miss Heilbron was not present. 
Her job was elsewhere. Two po- 
licemen stood by the door, silent, 
waiting for orders. 

A light tap on the door told them 
that Don Slent had left the build- 
ing. 

Grumeyer and Doris sat down. 
They did not link hands or even 
look at each other. 

“Now, please,’’ said Grumeyer 
to Miller, including the two police- 
men with a gesture, “don’t talk, 
whatever happens. I’ll talk. Doris 
may talk. We won’t disturb our 
own concentration, but you could.’’ 
After a pause he said casually, 
conversationally, “She knows 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



97 




she's being probed, but she is not 
particularly worried.” 

Miller had to clench his fists in 
the effort not to ask questions. The 
girl was not particularly worried? 
An Adamite secretly among Ter- 
rans, physically helpless against 
them, suddenly aware that she 
was being probed mentally — and 
she was not particularly 
worried? 

“This girl,” said Grumeyer, “is 
nervous and timid when there is 
little danger. She finds courage 
when it is needed. Her potential 
is even greater than I thought. She 
knows there are telepaths among 
us, but is surprised that we have 
units too. She is one of four — of 
eight — ril try to get thaf clearer.” 
“Quadruplets,” said Doris. “Her 
sisters and her father’s brothers.” 
“Yes, I see. The Adamites have 
only four such units. In sum they 
have far less telepathic experience 
than Terrans, but ours is spread 
thin among scores of individuals 
and theirs is concentrated in four 
practical partnerships of two.” 
While they calmly and method- 
ically took the girl’s mind to 
pieces. Miller was bursting to ask 
a score of questions. In particular, 
what was Gilen doing about all 
this? 

By chance, he got one of the an- 
swers at once. 

“She’s as interested in this as we 
are,” said Grumeyer. “Although 
she’s trying not to give anything 
away she — Doris?” 



“She doesn’t resent us,” said 
Doris. “But other resentments . 
She is not wholly in favor of the 
enterprise she’s engaged in. None 
of her sisters are. Yet something 
deep, something emotional 
makes her — ” 

“She does hate Terrans,” Gru- 
meyer exclaimed. “Very deep 
down — ” 

“No, it’s not hate. You might as 
well say love.” 

“Love-hate. I get a curious idea 
she waTerran.” 

Doris cried out as if in pain. Gru- 
meyer started and stared at her. 

“I’m all right,” said Doris, 
though she was very pale. “She 
didn’t like that. She knew you 
thought she was a Terran, and she 
hit back at you for thinking it.” 

“If she hit back, she missed me.” 

“She didn’t miss me — ” 

“Now why should she lash out at 
the very thought that she might be 
a Terran?” 

Miller could have answered that. 
All Adamites had to believe they 
were the First People. Telling Gi- 
len she was a Terran was denying 
her most fundamental belief. 

In his own way Grumeyer was 
working around to this conclu- 
sion. “She’s an Adamite, yes. She 
was born on Eden and until a few 
months ago . Something hap- 
pened a few months ago. Doris, 
can you get that? A few months 
ago somebody made her believe 
something that isn’t true — or de- 
nied something that is true. She’s 



98 



IF 




fighting to keep a secret deep in 
her mind, something we Terrans 
are not to be allowed to find 
out—” 

“Nick!” said Doris, suddenly, 
warningly, and stretched out her 
hand to him. 

But it was she who suddenly 
went white and rigid. Grumeyer 
cried out, jumped up and bent over 
Doris. 

And Miller signaled to the po- 
licemen to take the Adamite girl. 

T hey were all in Gilen’s room. 

Doris was there too. If she was 
harmed it was not physically. 

Gilen was quite docile. She 
looked curiously at Grumeyer, at 
Doris. Miller and the policemen 
did not interest her. 

Strangely, she apologized to 
Doris, who was pale and shaken. 
“I had to stop you. You were tear- 
ing me apart.” 

“Doris?” said Grumeyer anx- 
iously. 

Doris smiled. “Fortunately, by 
pure chance, I don’t mind. I don’t 
mind that when the skin grows 
again, I won’t be a telepath. 1 
never wanted to be a telepath. But 
as you hit out — I got what you were 
trying to hide. Your superiors 
sent you on this mission with cer- 
tain things blocked in your mind. 
Certain things some Adamites 
know.” 

Doris shook her head and leaned 
back. Nick fussed over her for a 
moment, but turned from her af- 



ter a few whispered words. 

He spoke not to Gilen, as Doris 
had done, but to Miller. 

“There’s something implanted in 
that girl. We are the real people. 
She has to believe it. It’s quite 
false, a purely emotional be- 
lief—” 

The policemen had to restrain 
Gilen as she tried to get at Gru- 
meyer and stop him saying what 
he was saying. 

“This whole operation,” said 
Nick, “was tentative partly because 
Adamites would always expect to 
be defeated by Terrans. That ex- 
plains their instant withdrawal fifty 
years ago when — ” 

“I could not tell you what you 
most want to know,” Gilen inter- 
rupted, “because I don’t know it 
either.” 

Nick looked a little puzzled. 
“She’s trying to hide something 
she doesn’t even know. This is 
strange. Doris?” 

“I think it’s something that one 
of her sisters knows.” . 

“Yes. But we didn’t get their 
names or locations.” 

Miller smiled thinly, looking at 
Gilen. “That can’t be hidden 
deep. We can easily get it from 
her.” 

Gilen sat up proudly. 

“You’ll never get anything out of 
me.” 

“I think,” said Miller, “we al- 
ready have what we want to know 
from Don Slent.” 

A few minutes later this was con-

firmed. On his arrest. Don was shot 
full of truth drugs. And Margaret 
Heilbron knew the right ques- 
tions to ask. 

E ric was not anxious to have 
Councilor Hardinge speak to 
Verne privately. The outcome 
might be his loss of her services. 
But the security of the settle- 
ment had top priority. 

In Eric’s tiny office Hardinge 
said, “I’m Job Hardinge. You’re 
Verne? Well, Verne, twice you’ve 
known about gnomes and hem- 
mers and the council wants to 
know how. Is it anything we can 
use?’’ 

She shook her head. “Just a 
hunch. A feeling of danger 

“Sure, I know that. If we haul 
you out of here could you organ- 
ize a defense group?’’ 

“I don’t want to be hauled out of 
here. I’m doing important work. 
I like it and I’m doing it well.’’ 

Like most Outwarders, Har- 
dinge was big and tough. Perhaps 
the gnomes got those who were not, 
Verne thought. 

“There’s nothing more impor- 
tant than beating the gnomes. 
What can you do? For instance, if 
you led a group of us with guns out 
on the plain, could you find where 
gnomes were hiding?’’ 

“I doubt it. I can sort of smell 
danger — that’s nothing new. A lot 
of other people — ’’ 

“Could you find other people 
like that?’’ 



It was possible she could, but on- 
ly by revealing more about her 
telepathic ability than she wanted 
to. 

“No,” she said. 

“Verne, you’re not cooperating. 

I can understand that you like 
working here and don’t want any- 
body to interfere with you. Sure, 
the work you’re doing is impor- 
tant and you’re good at it, but the 
point is your work her can wait. 
We have to do something about 
the gnomes and the hemmers if 
we’re to go on existing.” 

“That’s exactly the point,” said 
Verne. “Why? Why go on trying 
to build a settlement here?” 

“Oh hell. Quit stalling. We’re 
here. That’s it. And the immedi- 
ate priority is killing gnomes and 
hemmers. Or stopping them from 
killing us. Now, honestly. I’m 
asking you — how can you help 
against the gnomes and hemmers? 
You have something. Tell me how 
we can use it.” 

“I’ll have to talk it over with 
Red.” 

“Sure, do that. Red Conrad 
knows what it’s all about. And then 
come and see me.” 

She talked it over with Red and 
he put her straight. 

Until recently she had taken it 
for granted that her present situa- 
tion was temporary. Now that 
she was forced to examine her mo- 
tives, she began to wonder if she 
could ever really walk out on him. 

After talking to Red she went to 



100 



IF 




the town hall and found Hardinge. 
“I see now what you were getting 
at this afternoon/" she said. 

‘Thank Christ for that.” 

“Mr. Hardinge, I object to 
swearing. I realize it"s only a 
matter of making certain mean- 
ingless noises; but — ” 

“All right, never mind that. Go 
on.” 

“I have certain ideas. If you ar- 
ranged for Red and me to be free; 
for a while and gave us about a 
dozen people to work with — in- 
cluding my father — and an open 
mole — ” 

“What good would a mole be if 
it was open?” 

“Just an idea I have. You could 
give us a damaged one.” 

“And what would you do?” 
“Scour the plain around here. 
Something might come of it.” 

When he heard about this, Sal 
was not enthusiastic. “We won’t 
be here much longer,” he said. 
“We have to find out all we can 
about the Terrans. The local life 
is irrelevant — ” 

“Not to them.” 

“I know, but what good is it to 
find out about gnomes and hem- 
mers? We’d never try to colonize 
this world.” 

“No, we wouldn’t, would we?” 
“The enterprise is doomed to 
failure. The people here admit 
they’re never likely to trade ad- 
vantageously with other worlds. 
They also admit they’re nowhere 
near being independent. They 



must eventually abandon this 
planet.” 

“Do you see any sign they will?” 
“They’re stubborn. But they’ll 
finally give in.” 

“I don’t think so.” 

Indeed, she knew they never 
would and rather despised Sal for 
not seeing it. Terrans had a mul- 
ish streak; Adamites were far too 
rational not to give in when they 
were beaten. 

But so often when you were beat- 
en — you were not. 

O NE day Hakstrott himself 
brought Stewart his lunch, 
and set it down on the bed table in 
a way that told Stewart at once 
that this was The Day. 

“Eat that,” said Hakstrott. “Eat 
it all, because you won’t get any- 
thing else today.” 

Stewart started in on a big por- 
tion of roast beef, roast potatoes 
and peas. 

He asked, “It’s been done?” 
Hakstrott nodded. “Two hours 
ago. We waited until the day’s 
menu was one that gave us a per- 
fect opportunity.” 

“How is it going to work?” 

“First lunch is on now. Terrans 
and Adamites together. Water 
has been used in preparing every- 
thing on the menu, Terran or Ad- 
amite, except the roast beef and 
the potatoes. The peas are from 
cans. Only about three hundred 
of us know what’s been done. 
That’ll be enough.” 



THE REAL PEOPLE 



101 




“And the others won’t suspect 
anything?’’ 

“Why should they? Our three 
hundred, not all at one sitting, re- 
fuse soup, order roast beef and 
roast potatoes, no dessert, no 
coffee. They call for a bottle of 
beer. The others, those who don’t 
know, have soup or dessert or 
drink the lemonade on the tables 
or have tea or coffee afterwards.’’ 
“And the Adamites who don’t 
eat Terran food?’’ 

“Water is used in all the dishes 
on the menu today. And in their 
acat, of course. What they drink in- 
stead of coffee.’’ 

“Nobody will die?’’ 

“No. Nobody will even be drow- 
sy in the afternoon. But an hour 
after supper everyone except 
our three hundred will want to lie 
down. Some will go to bed early. 
Others will sit down and fall asleep 
in their chairs.’’ 

“Supper — how’s that going to be 
fixed?’’ 

“All food will be cooked in water 
or have water in it. This time those 
in the know will say they’re not 
hungry and will just have a piece of 
chocolate cake and a bottle of 
soda.’’ 

In the big dining rooms the plan, 
because it was basically simple, 
was working flawlessly. Every 
Adamite except Wil and Tomi 
attended one of the lunch sittings, 
Hakstrott told Stewart later. “The 
girl’s okay. She’s been seen 
drinking acat. We don’t know 



about Slent. He’s shut in his room 
as usual.’’ 

“He often has nothing but 
biscuits and cheese,’’ Stewart 
mused. 

“He drinks acat all day.” 

“Yes, but he has an urn in his 
room that was probably filled early 
today — before the water was 
treated.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” said Hak- 
strott confidently. “He’s being 
watched, of course. He’ll be dealt 
with along with the night guards.” 



T omi came to see Stewart in 
midafternoon. She did not re- 
fer to his peevishness at their last 
meeting. This time he made his 
manner friendly because that 
made it natural that he should offer 
her tea. She nodded. Stewart 
himself drank bottled lemonade. 

“You remember once before I 
had a feeling of impending 
disaster?” said Tomi. “I feel it 
again.” 

“Disaster?” 

She appealed to him seriously. 
“If there’s another move against 
us there will be more reprisals. I 
mean that, Stewart,” 

“You mean you’ll back repri- 
sals?” 

“I mean they’ll be inevitable. 
It’ll be disaster for both Adamites 
and Terrans. Do you know 
anything? Have you noticed 
anything?” 

He laughed, “Here?” 



102 



IF 




“Something’s going on, 
Stewart.” 

“Can’t you manage to make 
yourself call me John?” 

“Somehow, no. Elsewhere one 
of my siste.rs has married a Ter- 
ran. She and another sister want to 
stay where they are.” 

“You have radio communication 
faster than ours?” 

“I said I’d be frank, but I didn’t 
say I’d tell you everything. I’ve half 
a mind to go to my father and try 
to talk him into pulling out. What 
do you say?” 

He allowed himself time to 
think. Hakstrott’s effort might fail. 
It might end in bloody disaster. 

“Your prisoners,” he said. “The 
people you took to your ship. 
They’d have to be returned.” 

She nodded. “That’s under- 
stood.” 

Suddenly he thought of some- 
thing he had missed so far. 

It took a great effort for him to 
ask casually, “How long would 
that take?” 

“The ship would be here in ten 
hours.” 

Stewart thought swiftly. Even if 
the ship were summoned immedi- 
ately — in ten hours the station 
could be entirely in Terran hands, 
assuming everything went accord- 
ing to plan. 

However, all but three hundred 
of the complement of Fort Plato 
would be unconscious for many 
hours more. The fort could not be 
made a fort again, fully efficient 



and fully manned in ten hours. 

There would be a battle if the 
Adamite ship arrived. 

That made up his mind. The Ad- 
amite ship must not be summoned. 
Or the longer the summons was de- 
layed the better. Fort Plato had to 
be allowed maximum time to 
become a Terran fort again. He did 
not think it would fall again with 
Tomi and Slent out of action. 

“No,” he said. “I don’t think 
you should run.” 

She looked at him with all the 
old suspicion. It had never been 
more justified. He had to divert 
her somehow. 

“You say two of your sisters 
want to stay where they are. I know 
why you don’t want to stay.” 

“I’m listening.” 

“You’ve met, properly met, only 
one Terran — me. And we’ve never 
hit it off I don’t suppose we ever 
will.” 

“No.” Her agreement was 
emphatic. Excellent, Stewart 
thought, though with a pang of 
regret. He had lost her, but he had 
caught her attention. 

“But it would be just as easy for 
you as for your sisters to find a 
Terran who would at least interest 
you.” 

“How?” 

“Let me pick one for you. Go 
right now and find my brother.” 

“Your brother? The checker?” 

“The former checker.” 

“Why him?” 

He lay back on the pillows.

“Brothers often don’t get along too 
well. Sometimes their very similar- 
ities are to blame. Alan is like me 
in many ways. I have a feeling — I 
always had — that the differences 
are exactly the ones you’d like to 
find in me. 

“You never said anything about 
this before.’’ 

“Naturally. I really care for you, 
Tomi. Or I could. Or I could 
have.’’ 

She was bewildered and 
suspicious. “I’ve been lonely here. 1 
admit it. But if you think I’m so 
lonely and sex-starved that I’ll — ’’ 

“I’m not thinking of anything in 
particular except that Alan is just 
the kind of young Terran you 
should have been spending your 
time with — and weren’t. Want to 
find out about it?’’ 

She stood up. “Why not?’’ 

As she went Stewart breathed a 
sigh of relief. He had diverted her 
from her feeling of unease and her 
plan to summon the ship. 

And although events had forced 
him to arrange this particular 
meeting, it might work out. He and 
Alan had always gone for the same 
kind of girl. 

He sighed and tested his foot. It 
would do. He’d, be able to hobble 
about when necessary. 



T he tiny ship paused only brief- 
ly near Station 692. Nick’s cry- 
stal was on. Gilen’s thought 
stabbed at Pariss, who was asleep. 



Far Slent was deliberately exclud- 
ed. 

GILEN: Pariss, / have to 
know. That thing you have 
hidden in your mind — 

PARISS: (Shock, incre- 
dulity. Gilen near, a strange 
mental crackling, Gilen with 
power of thought that made 
her a different person; Gilen, 
timid Gilen, roaring like a 
lion — without Don, with 
somebody else. I can’t — 

GILEN: Pariss, I have to 
know. Pariss, we’ve got it. 
The seed. It’s on this ship. 

PARISS: You managed 
to steal it and get away with 
it? 

GILEN: No, the Terrans 
are in control here and they 
haven’t promised to give it 
to us. But they’ve said they 
might. 

PARISS: They just might? 

GILEN: We have to bar- 
gain, Pariss. We’re beaten. 

PARISS: Have you sur- 
rendered to the Terrans? 

GILEN: No, but I’m bar- 
gaining. They have the seed 
and you know something 
important. If you tell me 
what was hidden I may have 
more to bargain with. 

She got it. And The Great Ni- 
colas got it too. ' 

Y awns became frequent after 
supper. Stewart, anxiously

IF 




waiting for news and still in bed, 
was reassured to hear that 
Adamite suspicion had not been 
aroused. As well as having a 
soporific effect, the drug worked as 
a tranquilizer. People merely 
yawned and said, “Roll on bed- 
time.” Children willingly went to 
bed early, A few adults who were 
not creatures of habit did likewise. 

Tomi, in deep conversation with 
Alan Stewart, who had always 
thought her the most wonderful 
woman he had ever seen, did not 
notice drowsiness creeping up on 
her. Warning bells had entirely 
ceased ringing in her head, seduced 
into silence. 

At eight o'clock an Adamite col- 
onel at last became suspicious and 
ordered a check on the air supply. 
When this proved negative he 
shrugged, stretched himself and lay 
down for a moment. Two minutes 
later he was snoring. 

The three hundred Terrans 
moved into action. The Adamites 
were gently disarmed, 

Stewart hobbled from the clinic, 
Hakstrott beside him. 

Hakstrott was triumphant. 
“Look at them," he said. 
“Sleeping beauties. Only it’ll take 
more than a kiss to rouse them.” 

Forty minutes of clearing up fol- 
lowed, some of it bloody. Seventy 
sleeping Adamites had to be over- 
come one by one, group by group. 
Since there were three hundred 
armed Terrans to do this, the 
outcome was never in doubt. But 



there were some thirty more 
deaths, Adamite and Terran, to 
add to the two massacres. 

Tomi and Alan Stewart were 
found together on the green 
unharmed, asleep. It was fitting, 
John Stewart thought, that Tomi, 
who had won Fort Plato on the 
green, should meet defeat there 
with Alan, now the victor. 

It was not quite nine o’clock 
when Stewart quietly opened Wil 
Slent’s door and hobbled in. To 
make the situation clear he had a 
gun in his hand. 

“Good evening,” he said pleas- 
antly. “I’m informing you official- 
ly, Director Wil Slent, that Fort 
Plato is back in our hands.” 

Wil took only seconds to make 
up his mind that this was no hoax. 
Hakstrott, coming into the room 
behind Stewart, was also armed. 
Wil leaped to his feet, stepped back 
against the wall, taking from his 
pocket a small clear object like a 
large teardrop. 

“Don’t shoot,” Wil told Hak- 
strott quietly. “Your killing me 
would be fatal for both of you.” 
“You’ve summoned your ship?” 
“Yes. And I think you know, 
Stewart, that I cannot surrender? 
If I release this button — which I 
am now holding down with my 
thumb — the entire fort will be 
destroyed. It’s a precaution I took 
from the beginning.” 

Stewart, whose foot was sore, sat 
down comfortably. “What good 
would that do?” 



THE REAL PEOPLE

'"It would be a greater disaster 
for you than for us. Four hundred 
of us will die. Five thousand of 
you.” 

“That’s one way to look at it, I 
suppose.” 

“Stewart, I know you. I want 
you to stay. Tell him to get out and 
shut the door behind him.” 

Stewart looked over his 
shoulder. Hakstrott was unsteady 
on his feet and his left eye was 
twitching. 

“Better do as he says,” Stewart 
said quietly. 

Hakstrott closed the door behind 
him. 

“Have you killed my men?” 
Slent asked. 

“Only those we couldn’t help 
killing. Twenty or so. The rest are 
unharmed but helpless.” 

“Tomi?” 

“Like the others. Sound asleep.” 
“How did you do it?” 

“It doesn’t matter. The impor- 
tant thing is that we’ve done it. 
Switch that thing off, Slent.” 

“No. It gives me something to 
bargain with.” 

“Not very much.” 

“You know something of our 
ways. If I am defeated utterly — I 
have nothing to live for. I might as 
well be dead.” 

“So you would blow up Fort 
Plato and everyone in it, Terran 
and Adamite, just to take us all 
with you?” 

Wil smiled. “It wouldn’t be 
selfish, Stewart. In a way it would 



be selfless. It would be less than 
utter defeat.” 

“And Tomi?” 

“I have a most unusual 
advantage — you see, there are four 
of me and there are four of Tomi. 
Although I have no wish to die and 
no wish for Tomi to die, releasing 
this button won’t entirely kill either 
of us. You understand?” 

“I think I do. I suppose you hope 
to gain something by these rather 
melodramatic tactics. What?” 

“I ask you to let us withdraw.” 
“All of you?” 

“Naturally. I promise that the 
ship, when it arrives, will merely 
take us off and return your 
prisoners.” 

Stewart reflected. There was 
much in favor of Wil’s proposal. 

An urgent knock sounded at the 
door. 

“Don’t answer it,” Wil said 
sharply. 

Stewart levered himself up. 
“They know the situation. We have 
the checkpoint — remember? 
They’re watching us all the time.” 
Contact with the ship will be 
made if anything happens to me — ” 
“We all know that,” said 
Stewart soothingly, hoping he was 
right. 

He opened the door. Seeing that 
Stewart intended to go out, Wil 
said, “Stay here. If you go I’ll — ” 
“You won’t,” said Stewart. 
“Not while negotiations are still 
proceeding.” 

He went out, shutting the door 



106 



IF 




behind him. It might be better, he 
thought, if Wil did not hear what 
was said. It turned out he was 
right. He returned almost at once. 

“Most interesting,” he said, 
sitting down again. 

What is?” 

“Stent, we have to wait for an 
hour. Perhaps a little more, but not 
much. I suggest you sit down. And 
make sure you don't release that 
button inadvertently.” 

“What were you told?” 

“Let's just wait, shall we?” 

Wil gestured with the teardrop, 
but Stewart only smiled. “You 
won't do anything so silly as blow 
up the fort without knowing what’s 
happening. That's one thing I do 
like about Adamites. One knows 
where one is with them.” 

They waited silently. 

At last another tap came on the 
door. 

Stewart said, “Careful with that 
trigger finger. Director. It’s easy 
for you tQ blow us up but difficult 
to put us together again.” 

He opened the door. Four people 
came in and Wil did not release the 
button, for two of them were Gilen 
and Don. 



S TEWART and Miller found 
common ground at once. Both 
were egotists who liked to handle 
things without interference from 
above. In other circumstances 
they could have been antagonists, 
but now they agreed on the vital 



necessity of clearing up the sit- 
uation before TDC put a finger in 
the pie. 

The Adamite ship left with Wil 
and Don on board but without 
Gilen or Tomi. 

Unlike Verne and Pariss who, 
when consulted telepathically, 
would not even consider returning 
to Eden, Gilen and Tomi thought 
long and hard before deciding to 
stay. 

It was grotesque, Wil said, that 
Gilen should be considering a 
cabaret act with The Great 
Nicolas. Gilen merely shrugged 
and said that possibly TDC 
wouldn’t allow it anyway. But 
Grumeyer’s offer gave her a place 
among the Terrans, a spring- 
board, an opportunity she had not 
been previously granted. Verne and 
Pariss had already found their 
futures. She was looking around 
for hers. 

Twenty-four hours earlier Tomi 
would certainly not have remained. 
But she, like Gilen, felt that her ad- 
venture was just starting. She had 
not fallen in love with Alan 
Stewart — nevertheless, she was 
prepared to go on seeing him, 
prepared to meet Terrans other 
than those in Fort Plato, where she 
would always be hated because her 
father had ordered the execution of 
two hundred Terrans. 

She asked Miller, as a compara- 
tively impartial Terran, how she 
was likely to be treated on Earth. 
He said sourly, “You’re young and

appropriately shaped. You’ll be a 
heroine. You’ll make a billion 
dollars and marry eight times.” 
What finally decided her was a 
strange new contact in which her 
father and uncles played no part. 

PARISS — Hugh — Sta- 
tion 692: It’s the only way. 
We’ve all got to stay, of 
course — Tomi and Gilen 
have to take our word for it, 
Verne, but it’s impossible to 
go back. Is Hugh doing all 
right? The poor guy hasn’t 
the faintest idea of what’s 
happening, but he’s doing 
his best. 

GILEN — Nick ^ Fort 
Plato: Not very well, frank- 
ly, but it’s amazing that it 
works at all. They’re just a 
collection of people with 
trace telepathic potential? 

VERNE: That’s all. But 
as a group working on a 
specific problem here, we’re 
terrific. It’s a question not 
just of tracing gnomes and 
hemmers, but trying to 
reach them. The Terrans 
themselves could have gone 
on for years and gotten no- 
where, but with a little help 
from me — and Sal before 
he left — we’ve very nearly 
got an insoluble problem 
solved — but that’s my prob- 
lem, not yours. Why did the 
Terrans give you what you 



wanted? In four words: it’s 
nothing to them. 

PARISS: Verne, you do 
understand them! Red must 
be the same to you as Hugh 
is to me. 

VERNE: Hardly, Pariss, 
hardly. Yours is the great 
love of the galaxy— ours is 
a working arrangement. 
Curious that Red and I 
should actually be married, 
while you and Hugh — 

PARISS: Oh, we’ll be 
married. But we want every- 
thing cleared up first. 

VERNE: Anyway, about 
their letting us have the seed 
— well, first of all, they have 
plenty. Right, Gilen? Sec- 
ond, they don’t mind our 
having it. Not in the least. 

PARISS: They’ll make 
coarse jokes about it. 

VERNE: They’ll say Ad- 
amite men must be the la- 
ziest in the galaxy if they 
don’t take the trouble to fa- 
ther their own sons. 

TOMI: All right, so you 
know all about it. Tell me 
honestly why Gilen and 1 
should stay. 

PARISS: You’ll regret 
it all your lives if you don’t. 
Because the Terrans are the 
real people. That’s part of 
what I knew and you didn’t. 
Who could have guessed the 
other part? 



108 



IF 




O TOM I stayed. 

Sal Slent was picked up by 
the small Adamite ship lying off 
Outward. It had not yet been re- 
vealed to the Terrans ^here that 
Verne was other than what she 
seemed. Another small ship took 
Far Slent and the rest of the Ada- 
mites, except Pariss, from Sta- 
tion 692. When it had done so — 
and not before — Hugh showed 
Pariss the device which would have 
enabled him to retake the station 
and she understood at once why he 
had not wished to use it. It was a 
vibrator tuned to one specific en- 
cephalographic pattern, that of 
Hugh Suyang, an unpleasant de- 
vice which would have made ev- 
eryone else, Adamite or Terran, 
writhe in helpless agony while he 
personally secured the station. 
The experience would not have 
been fun for anyone and, since 
Pariss’s mental sensitivity was im- 
mense, it might well have killed 
her. 

Orders from Fort Plato were 
that the ships should be allowed 
to leave the solar system unmo- 
lested. Miller and Stewart were 
correct in assuming that these or- 
ders, in the name of the officer 
commanding Fort Plato, could 
not be countermanded in time to 
make a difference. 

“It’s quite amusing,’’ said Mil- 
ler, “that you and I should be in- 
duced to act generously and quix- 
otically, Stewart. Of course we are 
right. Proper Adamite-Terran re- 



lations won’t start for at least a 
generation — obviously. When they 
do they have a chance of starting 
right. All the same, it’s a laugh 
that we fixed it.’’ 



IX 

I T was a surprise to Miller to find 
Margaret Heilbron on the panel. 
He found himself inclined to resent 
the situation. He was in a sense on 
trial. Putting him on one side of the 
table and Miss Heilbron on the 
other seemed rather like endorsing 
her part in the matter at the 
expense of his. 

John Stewart was the first 
speaker. Facing the seven men and 
four women on the panel, he 
began smoothly: “It has been 
suggested that the departure of the 
Adamites, except for the four girls, 
was rushed through by those on the 
spot with indecent haste. Pro- 
tracted negotiations have been pro- 
posed. Let me say at once it was 
my conclusion — and it still is — that 
the sooner flash point was averted 
the better.’’ 

Some of the six senior officers, 
three civilians and two observers 
listening to him nodded approving- 
ly. Stewart was employing the 
courtroom tactics of which he was 
an acknowledged master. He did. 
not painstakingly establish that 
there had been considerable danger 
of an open battle; he had summa- 
rized that as a foregone conclusion. 




THE REAL PEOPLE 



109 




Unless somebody immediately 
challenged the phrase “flash point,” 
the implications of his statement 
would be tacitly accepted. 

Stewart went on. “Dr. Miller, 
who even before this affair was 
recognized as the leading authority 
on Adamites, will explain their 
motivation in a moment. By the 
way, I don’t believe you have been 
told that three of the four girls, 
Tomi, Pariss and. Gilen, are here 
and ready to give evidence if neces- 
sary.” 

He knew perfectly well they had 
not been told. Stewart never 
willingly went into any inquiry 
without more than his arm up his 
sleeve. 

“We’ll be very interested to hear 
from them,” said the president of 
the court. “Three, you say?” 

“The fourth, Verne, is still on 
Outward. The people there have 
not been told of her background. 
Possibly it would make no 
difference to them. Verne is 
something of a national heroine 
there. 

“But for one thing, and you all 
know exactly what 1 mean, it 
would be possible to consider this 
whole affair in the light of a 
somewhat irregular state visit. 
Let’s just for a moment look at it 
the other way around. If we had a 
chance to spy on the Adamites, 
would we have turned it down?” 

Nobody said anything until a re- 
tired air force man, taking a new 
angle, asked why, particularly, the 



Slents came to possess their 
peculiar talent. 

“The theory has been advanced 
that the reason may lie in the fact 
that the men are half and the girls 
are one-quarter Terran.” 

This produced a considerable ef- 
fect, which Stewart ignored, taking 
the opportunity to yield blandly to 
Miller. 

44'D EAR with me for the mo- 
-D ment,”said Miller, “while 1 
go back ten thousand years.” 

A choleric ex-major rumbled to 
the effect that he didn’t want a 
lecture. 

Miller restrained himself, merely 
snapping, “If the matters I’m 
about to deal with were not ex- 
tremely relevant 1 wouldn’t waste 
your time and, more important, 
mine, by detailing them. To re- 
sume, if 1 may — the Adamites 
know as little as we do about our 
history before Egyptian civiliza- 
tion. But what we know is this — 
at one time in the life of the hu- 
man race an advanced earlier 
technology depended far more 
on chemistry than does the pres- 
ent machine age. Effects now ac- 
complished by mechanical means 
were achieved via chemistry. The 
ancients’ secret of reaching the 
stars is lost, but it’s a fair guess 
they employed chemical rather 
than mechanical means. 

“The religion of this early race, 
ancestors of both Adamites and 
Terrans, was fanatically against 



110 



IF 




change in the physical makeup of 
humans. ‘Made in God’s image’ 
has remained in our religion to this 
day. The Adamites evolved a way 
of preventing evolution, to put it 
unscientifically. The basis was* 
chemical — I can tell you no more 
than that. The effect was that the 
genes were stabilized. The colonists 
would not evolve physically. 
That’s why after such a long gap, 
Adamites living on a world similar 
to but not identical with Earth have 
not adapted physically.” 

No' one objected to his lecture. 

“Only fairly recently did they 
find that inability to change was a 
liability.” 

Miss Heilbron interrupted. “Is it 
true that many Adamites are 
sterile?” 

Miller didn’t like interruptions. 
“Yes,” he said shortly. 

“And that’s part of the reason 
they wanted a bank of Terran 
semen?” 

“Please, Miss Heilbron, let me 
tell this in my own way.” 

“I just thought you were getting 
bogged down,” she said helpfully. 

He ignored her and continued 
rapidly: “Sterility became a major 
problem only when they started 
colonizing worlds other than Eden. 
The environment of these other 
worlds demanded certain physical 
variations. The Adamites couldn’t 
change. Fifty years ago the Adam- 
ites met Terrans. Terrans could 
adapt — they couldn’t. Terrans 
could throw up new types — they

couldn’t. Terrans could breed 
freely on new and different 
worlds — they couldn’t. It was this 
knowledge of inferiority more 
than anything else that made the 
Adamites withdraw. 

“Some forty years ago a Terran 
ship in trouble made for Eden 
because it was the only populated 
world in reach. She crashed on 
Eden. Of the seven survivors only 
one recovered fully. Four died 
within a month and the other two 
were helpless cripples for the year 
or two they lasted. 

“The man who remained, James 
Robertson, was the second radio 
operator. Apparently he had an 
unhappy background on Earth, 
and welcomed life among the 
Adamites. He found no enmity. 
Since the Adamites then as now 
wanted to learn all they could 
about Earth, he became an impor- 
tant man. The question of 
returning him to Earth did not 
arise. He didn’t want to go. He 
even took an Adamite name. He 
married an Adamite and had four 
children — all at once — and named 
them Wil, Far, Don and Sal.” 

Nobody said a word. 

“What interested the Adamites 
would have been a small thing to 
us, but it was important to them. 
The babies did not have frozen 
genes. They could evolve. Their 
children could be adaptable. 

“The special sympathy between 
the Slent brothers did not arouse 
much interest — twins and triplets 



among the Adamites possess this 
mutuality. But the advent of 
telepathy on Eden, in the persons 
of the four girls, was another 
matter. 

“This proved that , what Eden 
needed was Terran blood. Whether 
it had been intended or not, this 
was the key that unlocked the 
Adamites’ genetic prison. It made 
up all the ground lost in hundreds 
of generations. Adamites are 
small. One change in us in the last 
few hundred years is an increase in 
the average height and weight. The 
Adamites — ” 

Miss Heilbron interrupted again. 
“Dr. Miller, the Adamites who led 
this visitation — ” 

“I know. The Slents are not 
small, for obvious reasons. And all 
the other personnel chosen for this 
operation were tall Adamites.” 

“Robertson had no more 
children by his wife and his sons 
were childless except Wil. But the 
Adamites know as much as we do 
about artifical insemination and 
there are literally hundreds of men 
and women fathered by Robertson, 
of whom some have latent 
telepathic talent. Robertson is 
dead now. He died seven years ago, 
before the full extent of his gift to 
Eden was known. 

“And although the Slents have 
only Wil’s four girls by natural 
means, they, too, have hundreds of 
offspring by AI. Some of these off- 
spring also have telepathic talent.” 

It was scarcely necessary for 



112 



IF 




Miller to do any more explaining. 

The Adamite venture had had as 
its main object the capture of 
Terran seed. The four girls, 
obviously highly talented, had been 
expected to become pregnant, but 
what mattered even more was the 
capture of the seed of uncounted 
Terrans. This could unlock the 
whole Adamite race. 

The Adamites, desperately need- 
ing the seed, had never imagined 
asking for it. They had assumed 
they must steal it, meanwhile plot- 
ting to bypass a space war. 

T he atmosphere at an equiva- 
lent meeting far, far away was 
initially less friendly. 

General Print was still alive. 
Early in the proceedings, however, 
he said he was sorry he had not 
died before, he had to witness the 
return of four defeated Adamite 
Directors without the most valu- 
able section of their force — their 
own daughters and nieces. 

Wil said with the quiet dignity he 
had acquired, “My daughters were 
placed in command. General. You 
acquiesced in their being placed in 
command. I make no excuses — but 
you cannot blame any of us here 
that they chose to remain.” 

“No,” the general admitted. 
“But you suffered defeat. You ad- 
mit as much. The Terrans tri- 
umphed in all four echelons.” 
“There,” said Sal Slent, “you 
are not merely unfair but quite 
wrong. General. We have no 



reason to suppose that we should 
ever have been detected on Out- 
ward as Adamites. Verne’s record 
there has been one of continuous 
success in what she set out to do.” 
“At the Terran General 
Purposes Station,” said Far Slent, 
“Suyang could have retaken his 
command from the beginning. Nor 
could we have known this, since he 
is a telepath and probing him 
before the occupation began would 
Kave alerted him and made the 
operation impossible.” 

General Print, frowning, said, “I 
do not like this new attitude. You 
seek to evade resp:>nsibility. First 
you blame the four girls, saying 
they were in command, not you. 
Then you excuse yourselves. In my 
day an Adamite officer stood or 
fell by his achievement.” 

“This, we learned among the 
Terrans, is wrong,” said Wil. 
“Certain of their national armies at 
one time had similar beliefs. The 
consequence of such an attitude is 
that a general cannot gamble. But 
if he meets an enemy who mil 
gamble, who can afford to gamble, 
in the end he must be beaten.” 

The general had to fight for self- 
control. “What are you trying to 
tell me?” 

“That if we failed, we failed as 
Adamite Directors, steeped in the 
tradition of the Adamite Navy. 
And if the ruling is that we should 
be executed, I tell you now what I 
shall say when given my final 
opportunity to speak — that if you

fight TDC this way you will be 
defeated.” 

“That is your considered 
opinion?” 

“It is the opinion of all of us.” 

The other three nodded. 

“It will be given due weight.” 

The meeting went on for a long 
time. Old General Print became 
very tired. But he and the other 
officers had to admit finally that 
the new resilience, the new 
toughness of the four officers 
before them bore out all they 
claimed. They were not the same 
men who had started on the op- 
eration. 

P ARISS had the last word the 
first time she had a bitter quar- 
rel with Hugh — who had, in a mad 
moment, chased a secretary be- 
cause Pariss was pregnant again 
and capricious. They had never 
spoken bitterly to each other and 
were shocked by what each said. 
The reconciliation was a passionate 
relief to both of them. 

But as she found Hugh, her 
Hugh, her nearly perfect Hugh, 
apologetically making up to her, 
freely and sincerely acknowledging 
that she was the one who counted, 
not merely in their marriage but as 
a person. Pariss suddenly said, 
“We are the real people!” 

“I beg your pardon?” said Hugh 
politely. 

“We are the real people!” 

“Yes, that’s what 1 thought you 
said. What does it mean? You and 



I? You and I and little Will? You 
and I and — ” 

“You’re out of it, darling. I’m 
sorry, but it’s true. You’re only a 
Terran, and a passable, though 
not remarkable, telepath.” 

“What do you mean, not 
remarkable? My new rating — ” 
“Yes, darling. I love you — or I 
wouldn’t have cared if that little 
bitch had taken you and eaten you. 
In many ways you’re most 
remarkable. You’re wonderful. But 
we are the people who count, all the 
same. The Adamite-Terrans. The 
offspring of two great races. The 
four of us. Verne and Red 
practically run Outward. You’re a 
colonel now and you know very 
well you’d never have made it at 
your age if you hadn’t married me. 
Tomi and Alan are high in TDC, 
and Gilen is so rich she’ll be able to 
do anything she wants whenever 
she finds out what it is — ” 

Hugh kissed her. “Now before I 
beat you,’’ he said “get this 
straight. You’re half right. But 
only half You and your sisters are 
fabulous — but tell me, where would 
Verne be without Red? Gilen 
without Nick or some other link 
man? Tomi without Alan? You 
without — ” 

“Exactly, darling!” 

“But you said — ” 

“Language is a poor way to 
communicate if you don’t need 
it.” She sighed. “Real people are 
those who need each other. You 
know what I mean.” •

IF 





His kind had always killad 
by night and diad by day • • • 
but a new dawn was at hand! 

H e came awake suddenly. 

His muscles were tensed, he 
was growling, but his eyes and 
brain were overwhelmed. Dan- 
ger . stimulus . The light 
flared around him. His head 
pounded with sensation. 

The light — the light! It couldn’t 
be shaken. He was on his feet, 
wincing. The light was blinding, 
teasing ... a madcap confusion. 

With practiced deliberation he 
turned, sought the deepest recess of 
his burrow. 

As a last alternative he tried to 
hide his eyes in the fur of his tail, 
shutting them tightly. His eyelids 
quivered with the exertion, but the 
light was a red glow that seared 
into his brain.

Dazzled and frustrated he leaped 
to the wall, lashed out with his 
claws and dug a hole for his head 
and muzzle. And a breathing pas- 
sage. Ramming his head inside he 
managed to tame the torture of 
the light enough to feel he could re- 
turn to sleep. 

He was yet a young, unmated 
male and therefore of low status. 
His burrow, accordingly, joined 
the main tunnel close to the en« 
trance. 

He had no fear of the dayhunt- 
ers. They rarely would dare to 
venture into the tunnel. Besides, 
he had killed many during his 
night hunts. Even with light blast- 
ing into his burrow he was sure he 
could fight well enough to save 
himself. No, the trouble with his 
burrow was that if he awakened 
during the day the light would be 
enough to madden him. 

His fur, ruffled by his tensed 
skin, settled slowly. His breath- 
ing slowed. His eyelids relaxed. 
The light that remained in his eyes 
was enough like starlight to keep it 
from bothering him. Sleep closed 
in. The thoughts dissolved and 
drifted off. 

He awoke. But this time his taut 
muscles did not twitch against 
sudden, instinctively sensed 
danger. The faint light that 
reached him was that of the stars, 
almost deepened out of exis- 
tence. 

He paused for several min- 
utes, stretching, feigning, reco- 



ordinating his mind and body. 
He felt for the umpteenth time 
that state of health, readiness and 
strength. He trotted out of his bur- 
row and down the tunnel, sensing 
his way, heading towards the 
starshine. 

Others were already out, wan- 
dering about the entrance, sniff- 
ing and scanning the bushes for 
signs of prey. 

He headed directly out into the 
growth, ducking under branches, 
trotting through the soft humus. 
His eyes were wide and conscious- 
ly alert. A dayhunter asleep or 
concealed in the branches of a 
bush or a busheater trundling 
across the ground — either would 
be fine tonight. He was exactly 
hungry enough to be satisfied 
with the amount of food they of- 
fered. 

A scent shocked him into a run. 
A dash under a branch, a rapid 
turn, a sight, pursuit and spring, a 
biting and a clawing — and the 
busheater, blood welling from a 
dozen wounds, was his. 

Calming from the dash, he real- 
ized that he had just caught his 
meal. 

Starting at the flank of the ani- 
mal he began to snap and tear at 
the moist, warm meat. 

When he had taken all he re- 
quired he lay down a short dis- 
tance from the carcass and confi- 
dently began to lick the last rem- 
nants of blood from his paws. He 
had made a lucky and easy kill and

IF 




wondered what he might do for 
the remainder of the night. 

After some time to digest his 
meal he started at a leisurely pace 
through the brush. The stars over- 
head, brilliant pinpoints, though 
painful to look at still attracted 
his attention and awe. The sky 
was so full of them it would be 
nearly impossible to fit any 
more in. They lighted things soft- 
ly, evenly, much more benevo- 
lently than the brilliant, stabbing 
rays that came from something 
unthinkably bright during the 
day. 

A new scent caught his atten- 
tion. A female. Just her scent. 
An unaccompanied, unmated fe- 
male. He trotted off in her direc- 
tion. 

His first sight of her told him she 
was healthy. The starlight sheened 
on her fur. Her body was taut, 
trim. Her responses were excel- 
lent — she whirled the instant she 
detected his approach. 

He continued his approach, but 
slowed. He got quite close to her 
before she jerked back nervous- 
ly. He stopped. 

She turned to walk off. He 
leaped toward her. She whirled to 
defend and he shoved her muzzle 
to one side with his. The taunt an- 
gered her. He walked lightly 
around her, continuing to tease 
her with feints. Finally in infuri- 
ated confusion she sprang at him. 
He rolled over to accept. She 



landed, then bounded away in in- 
dignation. 

He let her go, confident of hav- 
ing performed well. 

The rest of the night was spent in 
a bright stroll and a few aborted 
darts after prey. All the while the 
stars flashed overhead. 

As the sky grew still brighter he 
headed for the tunnel. He knew 
that soon the light would become 
intolerable and that the day- 
hunters would be able to kill. 

Following his sense and the 
sound of the others at the tunnel 
entrance, he made his way back 
without difficulty and quickly 
ducked into the comfortable 
dimness of the tunnel. 

He did not stop to socialize 
near the entrance but continued 
toward his interior. He thought 
once he scented the female, but be- 
ing unsure and feeling a bit hun- 
gry from having eaten so early, 
he decided not to bother to inves- 
tigate. He ducked into his bur- 
row and, taking care to shield his 
eyes from the coming light, lay 
down to sleep. 

T he last brilliant purple rays 
of dayshine were in the tunnel 
as he awoke. The exotic sparks of 
color were dazzling, but not real- 
ly bright enough to be offensive. 
Fascinated, he moved out into 
the tunnel. 

The glaring color there was 
more brilliant than he had ex- 
pected. He stood painfully mes- 



HABITS OF THE RIGELI AN NIGHTFOX 



117 




merized by the flaring purple. 
Unable to stand the light he stum- 
bled back, missed the entrance to 
his burrow, blinded as he was. 

He continued down until a few 
barely perceptible turns in the 
tunnel shielded him from the light. 
He paused, and then walked a lit- 
tle farther before stopping to re- 
gain his eyesight and wait for the 
last of the daylight to fade. 

He was considering moving 
back up into the now vanishing 
light when he was challenged. The 
growl came from a male of higher 
status than he, who obviously 
had no sympathy for those who 
tried to borrow the privileges of 
rank. Still, he knew his opponent 
could not be fully awake or accus- 
tomed to the light. Making the 
most of his advantage he replied 
with a vigorous and confusing 
barrage of threats and feints. His 
opponent became vicious, pounc- 
ing, bounding, lashing out, all in- 
effectively. 

Finally, satisfied at his display 
of defense, he retreated at a fast 
trot toward the starlight. 

He stopped at the entrance to 
look around and scent the wind and 
listen — most carefully. A half-ac- 
knowledged hope was let go and 
he set off into the brush, the first 
of the night's hunters. 

Prey was elusive that night and 
for several hours all he seemed 
capable of doing was sight an ani- 
mal, then lose it. He did not make 
his kill until later on in the night. 



when he caught a day hunter who 
had made the mistake of eating 
too well and concealing itself too 
poorly. It’s throat torn open, it 
died slowly, its jaw convulsing 
and its teeth flashing in the star- 
shine. 

He was hungry and only by care- 
fully stripping the body of all its 
flesh did he manage to satisfy 
himself. 

After relaxing a while he left 
the carcass and tried scenting the 
air again. He followed up a few 
chances but didn’t luck out. The fe- 
male was not around — or at least 
not where he could find her. 

He returned to the tunnel early 
and spent a good deal of time 
around the entrance. But finally 
he decided the effort was useless 
and turned in for the coming day. 

W HEN he roused himself night 
had already fallen and he 
knew he had missed his best 
chance. So he took his time in pre- 
paring to leave the tunnel. 

Once out he settled down to the 
real business of hunting and put 
in a substantially better perfor- 
mance than he had managed the 
night before. 

He spent the night in a pretty 
purposeful manner, first hunt- 
ing, then following his meal with 
plenty of exercise and even some 
rough play with another male of 
about his status. 

Abruptly his senses alerted him 
to the female. He dropped all pre- 



118 



IF 




tense in an instant. He was able to 
trace the scent to her in a matter 
of minutes. 

She had been having a hard 
night of it and was still tracking 
prey when he found her. He stayed 
behind and to one side of her as 
she moved along — and she ignored 
him. 

For many minutes he strained 
every sense in order to spot some 
prey. He caught the outline of an 
animal through a dense clump of 
bushes and scrambled off after it. 
One hurried glance behind him 
showed that she had joined the pur- 
suit. 

The animal was particularly 
fast and evasive, but he was in no 
mood to be shaken now and with a 
furious effort at speed he over- 
took his victim and brought it 
down at a full run. 

The female arrived moments la- 
ter. She hesitated a short distance 
away, trying to decide whether 
simply to take the meal, to threat- 
en for it or walk off. She finally 
moved toward the kill and, after 
receiving some assurance, be- 
gan to eat. 

She ate slowly and with an air 
of uncertainty, occasionally look- 
ing up at him before continuing. 
All the time he lay nearby waiting 
for her to finish. 

Finally deciding she had taken 
all she wanted she looked up at him 
again. He did nothing. 

She came over and lay down 
next to him to digest her meal. 



A S HE lay in his burrow he tried 
to remember what they had 
done. 

He remembered walking — yes, 
walking. They had continued 
walking. Why? Through the star- 
shine and the brush. They had 
walked all night. 

And then at the tunnel en- 
trance — even though the first 
traces of daylight were showing 
he had wanted to stay there with 
her. She had not sensed his wish or 
had seemed not to. She went right 
in. But he had wanted to stay out 
there, even as the light was grow- 
ing more and more intense. 

He could not make up his mind 
not to let it bother him, so he sim- 
ply decided to get to sleep — and 
quickly before the day became too 
bright. 

H e was surprised to find her 
waiting for him at the en- 
trance that night. It was some- 
thing he had not expected. Her be- 
ing there felt warm to him, though. 

Already they were growing 
close. She seemed to feel safe near 
him. He felt her added confidence 
in him and it worried him a bit. 

They moved quietly and slowly 
through the night. They did so for 
love of quiet, not stealth. He 
thought once that they should real- 
ly be hunting. They would need 
something to eat. But she seemed 
to in love with the quiet and the 
warmth between them for hunt- 
ing. There was no hunger. 



HABITS OF THE RIGELIAN NIGHTFOX 



119 




He nuzzled her. 

There was no hunger. He felt 
none until he and she were back at 
the tunnel entrance, with the 
threat of day in the skies. Then he 
felt it as an anguish. She headed 
on into the tunnel, but he had to 
stop. A whine escaped him. She 
turned to look at him — something 
in her answered and sympa- 
thized, She almost started back to 
him. But faced with the growing 
light she turned away again and 
walked slowly down. 

Left on his own, he felt drained. 
His anguish became a lonely re- 
morse. He stumbled into the tun- 
nel and entered his burrow. There 
was some small comfort in the 
darkness he lay dovvn fn. And 
sleep was always kindly. 

D arkness? Night again. Not 
long had it been night, but the 
light was starlight and hunters 
were about. 

He felt he had slept well and that 
he was very, very hungry. 

He met her as she was coming 
from the deeper portions of the 
tunnel and they continued to- 
gether out into the open. 

They hunted in a bright but pur- 
poseful fashion that night, bring- 
ing down two kills and sharing 
each of them. They played gently, 
affectionately most of the rest 
of the night. She became drowsy 
and he let her rest while he preened 
her fur. 

This time as they went back to- 



ward the tunnel she acted rather 
droopy and paused in the entrance 
with him. She lay down. 

For an instant lie was horri- 
fied. But his fears didn’t mean 
much now. He lay down with her. 

The game started with small, 
tentative pawings. Licks fol- 
lowed. Then came nibbles. A nip. 
More vigorous movements. In- 
tense, excited. The light was grow- 
ing brighter. Objects glared into 
their consciousnesses. The light 
sparkled on their furs, gleamed in 
enraptured eyes, heightening 
their excitement and intensify- 
ing their growing frenzy. The bril- 
liant colors of the beginning day 
surrounded them and added to the 
violence besieging their bodies 
and brains. 

They struggled for sensation, 
receiving it in contacts, paw- 
ings, nips, nuzzles, pressures, 
contractions, flexings. Her as- 
sault was no less vigorous than 
his — sometimes she bit him hard 
enough to make him yelp. 

The light was too brilliant, too 
blinding, too maddening to see 
by — sanity was out of the ques- 
tion. They struggled and thrashed 
in all all-enveloping sea of un- 
bearable feeling. 

An incredible pain in his thigh, 
another in his shoulder — in his 
back with the full light blazing 
right through his brain! 
Claws — teeth! He lashed with his 
legs and tried to bite back at his at- 
tackers. Pain — light! He scram-

IF 




bled to his feet and felt claws and 
teeth trying to bring him down 
again. Dragging his attackers 
with him he headed toward what 
must be the deeper end of the tun- 
nel. 

His body seemed solely de- 
voted to registering pain. It 
throbbed with it. Never had he felt 
so gritty and disabled, so har- 
assed by pain . 

His attackers were gone. He 
could only dimly realize it and 
then the thought was drowned in a 
flood of agony in his body, in his 
brain, in his eyes — his ears. In his 
ears was what he didn’t want to 
hear, what he wished the pain — 
this fantastic pain — would drown 
out. But he heard it again and 
again — the piteous death screams, 
the souless noises of the carniv- 
ores . 

A wakening was a fitful 

►thing — he avoided it as much 
as possible. The pain was dulled 
only by monotony. The throb- 
bing had not ceased. 

No, he could not come fully 
awake. He only reached the bor- 
derline of awareness. And it was 
intolerable. The only horror 
that was gone was the light. The 
screams the smell of open blood 
and the helplessness, the sense of 
infirmity that bordered on 
death — these stayed with him. 

W HEN he finally could spend 
some time awake and not in- 



sane with pain, it seemed he had 
spent his entire life in agony. 

He became aware that he was 
being fed and that this burrow 
was larger and darker than any he 
had been in even as a pup. 

Others were here, a few 
healthy — but more like himself, 
torn open, with dried blood on their 
wounds and fur. And one who 
thrashed in agony almost con- 
tinuously for days, sleeping only 
in exhaustion, until he died. 

Mated pairs were here, some 
with very minor wounds. Most 
acted as if they had been through 
all this before. 

It may have been days before a 
realization of the significance 
of all he was experiencing first 
struck him — the times when he 
could think were few. He was still 
in great pain and when not crying 
and whining in agony he had oth- 
er things to cry and whine for. His 
mind was not to be used because 
there were too many things it could 
remember . 

But still at some time he thought 
about the mates and their 
wounds — and his wounds and 
her — and of screams. 

He knew all about it now. He 
had learned all about why mates 
had so many scars. He knew where 
the injured came from and where 
they went and why the elders pre- 
ferred to hunt dayhunters. 

It had nearly cost him his life to 
find out. Had it cost him even more 
dearly. Many had found out this 



HABITS OF THE RIGELIAN NIGHTFOX 



121 




way. Many probably never found 
out. How many wouldn’t? 

It was a horrible, terrible 
trick, this threat that hung over his 
kind. 

His existence was now to be val- 
ued. 

It was a long time before he 
even thought of getting up. And 
when he tried, the cracking of dried 
blood, the flexing of injured mus- 
cles and the splitting of unhealed 
wounds sent him down screaming 
in wretched agony. 

He resigned himself to spend- 
ing the rest of his life where he lay 
in constant pain and on the brink 
of agony. 

Finally one of the healthy males 
started to shove him, to force him 
to his feet. His pain was now bear- 
able. He even mustered a show of 
defense. But he shuffled away from 
his opponent soon enough. 

He fell once and felt he should 
not get up again. But the prospect 
of returning ability was too great. 
He managed to get to his feet 
again. 

He worked his way into the main 
tunnel and stood there. He couldn’t 
hunt. He couldn’t live. 

He turned and reentered the bur- 
row. Cautiously he lay down again. 
He was not disturbed. But he 
would get up tomorrow and the 
next day. And perhaps he would 
again see the light of the stars. 

H e continued to get up 

and slowly regained his abil- 



ities. First he merely walked 
around, but soon he was helping 
the healthy ones in their caring for 
the injured. 

He spent a great deal of time in 
that capacity. On one occasion he 
helped to drag one who had ceased 
to suffer back out into the 
starshine. The task tempered his 
joy at seeing the stars. They would 
only shed their benevolent light so 
long before they were overwhelmed 
by the violence of the day. And 
drawn to that violence, mates 
would die. 

During his last nights at the 
communal burrow he sometimes 
ventured out into the starshine in 
efforts to regain some of his long 
lost skill at hunting. On one such 
night he accidentally roused and 
killed a dayhunter and decided to 
return to his own burrow. 

His former burrow was occupied 
and he knew better than to 
challenge the healthy young thief. 
He moved on down the tunnel. 

Somewhere along the line he no- 
ticed a burrow that was unoccu- 
pied. He could guess why. 

He moved in and was not chal- 
lenged. Apparently his wounds had 
gained him enough status to allow 
him to fit comfortably into a more 
prestigious neighborhood. 

But it took many nights of hunt- 
ing before he felt he had regained 
his old capabilities. 

H e had hunted dayhunters ex- 
clusively recently — but this 



122 



IF 




night was still going to be different. 
His careful scrutiny of the bushes 
was prodded by more than hunger. 
When he found one finally, leaped, 
grabbed it in his teeth and dragged 
it to the ground, he went about the 
task of killing it in a manner more 
deliberate than normal. The glare 
in his eyes was not to be found on 
the hunter of food. 

Even so, it was not without 
several hesitations that he left his 
victim for a search of his next kill 
of the evening. 

He had killed many more before 
he finally ate, rested and headed 
back to the tunnel. He trotted 
through the night with new 
satisfaction. He had killed only a 
small fraction of the dayhunters in 
the area, but a few nights like this 
one would serve more than to help 
satisfy his thirst for vengeance. 

The stars were bright all over the 
sky and pain had not bothered him 
all night. He was feeling better 
than he had in a long time. 

He moved under the bushes with 
little care for the hunters that un- 
doubtably slept somewhere among 
them. He felt almost as ecstatic as 
he had felt as a pup. He was sure 
now he could solve a problem that 
had stumped his peers all their 
lives — and others before them. 

He stopped so suddenly that he 
nearly stumbled. The faint scents 
on the breeze had shocked, 
alarmed and ruined him in an 
instant. 

He loped off to investigate. 



doubting for the first time a sense 
that had never failed him. But there 
it was, a pup standing over a day- 
hunter's carcass, one far too large 
for it to have killed. There was no 
doubt in his mind, the pup had 
found one of his earlier kills and 
made a meal of it. He needed no 
other proof to know his other kills 
had b^n similarly found and used. 
He did not even tether to drive the 
pup away — it would simply return 
after he left. It would not kill a 
dayhunter for itself that night. 

He lay awake as the day came 
on. But now it was not the light 
that kept him from sleep — the light 
was kinder here, more like star- 
shine, than it had been in his old 
burrow. No, it was a churning, an 
eating away in the deeps of his 
body that caused his wakefulness. 
He knew no confidence now — only 
a cruel deflation of his ego. This 
danger could not be fought — the 
threat was not in teeth or muscles. 
It was abstract, confusing, defying 
and eluding all attack. He felt 
helpless. 



N ights followed and days lit- 
tle noticed between them. 
There was hunting, killing, dying 
and eating. Time laboriously 
wasted, things tediously unnoticed. 

Then a night of sudden horror. 
He fell, tumbling, felt an impact, 
rolled and slid to a stop. 

His alarm -^was quickly 
mastered — where was he? In some 



HABITS OF THE RIGELIAN NIGHTFOX

deep place. He saw a rim above 
him, an unnatural horizon that 
cramped the stars above it. The 
ground smelled moist and fresh. 

He was in a burrow of some sort, 
something that had been dug out of 
the ground. It was unlike any of the 
burrows he had known. This place 
was deep without being covered — 
it had no branching tunnels or bur- 
rows. He had come into it by fall- 
ing. Out would be by leaping or 
climbing. 

He had never seen it before, or 
anything like it. It was newly here, 
it was near enough to the tunnel 
for him to have found it long ago 
had it been here before. 

But that it was didn't 
surprise him. Many things changed 
in storms. Bushes were torn apart. 
The ground became soft and stank. 
There had been a storm during the 
last day. He had been awakened by 
it and had spent a while listening to 
it and remembering another storm 
he had heard quite some time 
before. Storms caused many 
things. This one had caused some 
strange things. It had killed and 
knocked down one of the high 
bushes. He had been looking at it, 
walking around it. It was odd to see 
a high bush on the ground — they 
looked so much bigger than when 
they were standing. 

Then he had fallen. 

His shock was gone now and, 
sensing this place to be as friendly 
as any burrow he had ever been in, 
he set about. looking it over. His 



curiosity led him into a minute 
study of the space around him. It 
was not until he knew it as well as 
any of the area above that he began 
to amuse himself by digging into 
the wall of the pit. He dug casually 
and the hole he produced slowly 
began to take on the shape of a 
burrow. Even before he had 
finished it had a narrow entrance 
as long as his body and enough 
room beyond it for him to turn 
around easily. He had never dug a 
burrow before, probably because 
he had never had a space to dig 
one, but he felt nothing unusual in 
doing so now. 

The burrow was becoming quite 
roomy when he noticed that it was 
more brightly lit than it had been. 
He turned towards the entrance 
and was struck by the intensity of 
the light coming in. Already it was 
too bright to see his way out of the 
pit. The dayhunters would be out 
soon. Only the security of his being 
underground kept him from being 
unnerved. Despite the uncomforta- 
ble light he stayed facing the en- 
trance, prepared to give a deter- 
mined defense against any day- 
hunter who would venture in. 

For a long while there were no 
dayhunters. The light grew mad- 
dening, but his tolerence of it was 
fortified by his instinct to survive. 
Memories of days past served only 
to tighten his muscles. 

There — there was a dayhunter — 
two — more. The scents were clear 
— a small pack was above. They

had scented him, the danger was 
feverishly real. 

They drew no nearer — they 
shifted up the wind and down the 
wind. They were confused. 

His eyelids were down tightly 
now — he could no longer hope to 
see. Still the light seared through 
them in a raging red madness. 
Defending would be almost 
impossible. If he opened his eyes 
the light would blast right through 
his mind. 

He heard a scrabbling and 
caught a new scent. A dayhunter 
was in the pit. No sooner had he 
realized this than he heard piping 
cries of terror and scrambling on 
the walls of the pit. For a long 
while they continued, their frenzy 
never dimishing. Finally they 
ceased and the scent was more 
distant. 

He was safe here. The 
dayhunters were terrified of the pit. 
He grasped the fact desperately, 
whirled to bury his face and 
agonized eyes in the wall of the 
burrow. 

He was safe here — the day would 
pass and he would survive. The 
dayhunters were afraid of the pit, 
of the tunnel, of being below 
ground. He was safe here. 

The day wore on and he 
managed to sleep through some of 
it. The night came. He awoke and 
left the pit. He found and dragged 
down a dayhunter and ate a needed 
meal. The he returned to the pit 
and spent the rest of the night 



enlarging the burrow, lengthening 
it and curving the length back on 
itself. 

Long before day threatened he 
left the pit to return to the tunnel 
and his own burrow. 

I T WAS well into the night be- 
fore he woke again. It took him 
quite a while to adjust to the shift 
in time caused by his oversleeping. 
He missed the group he normally 
saw at the entrance — they had long 
since left on the night’s hunt. The 
sky was ahead of his reckoning. 
The busheaters were more active 
than his sense told him they should 
be. He made an easy kill of one he 
surprised. It was the first he had 
eaten in a long while. It didn’t sat- 
isfy him completely, but he decided 
not to do any more hunting just 
yet. He left the carcass and strolled 
out under the starshine. 

The omens were pleasant this 
night and he noted he was letting 
his guard relax. Not since he had 
healed had he felt so glad of the 
stars. His body no longer reminded 
him of its infirmities. He sensed 
again its health and potential. 
There was a lightness in him that 
he had not felt in a long while. 

He came to an open spot he had 
known and loved during other 
nights. Here the stars could be seen 
as a vast coverage of sky. Here he 
could see dapplings and vapors and 
bursts that stood ever still in the 
pattern of the moving night. Col- 
ors and brilliances, faintnesses and 



HABITS OF THE RIGELI AN NIGHTFOX 



125 




textures, all beautiful to look at, 
but always a bit painful, always 
stimulating, as something too 
wondrous to bear. 

Dazzled, he lowered his eyes. It 
was dangerous to stare too long at 
the stars — his eyes were full of the 
ghosts of them. Only in after some 
minutes did he recover his sight. 
Such dangers were not to be 
lightly accepted. Studying the night 
was not something to be done once 
the stars were known. His pleasure 
in the moment was destroyed. 

Somber movings were in him as 
he left the clearing behind. Dangers 
were ever-present and always most 
intensely to be guarded against in 
moments of wonder. It had always 
been so. Not in his time, nor 
perhaps even in his parent’s time 
had anyone beheld beauty without 
subjecting himself to danger. But 
not until this night had he 
completely realized the morbid 
vastness of this truth. It was 
immune to any effort to alter it. 

The mind of the hunter withdrew 
uncertainly from something that 
threatened from everywhere. From 
the stars that shined overhead, the 
leaves around him and the ground 
under his feet. He moved on, 
trailing his depression behind him. 

He noted the scent of a female at 
first without feeling. Hunger 
knawed at him. He felt disheveled 
and sightsore. Realities he could 
not comprehend had crushed his 
joys from every side. 

He stopped. The air moved 



quietly about him, the brush 
whispered around him. They had 
always done so, but he had to stand 
still to know them. The scent of a 
female blended with them, became 
part of the harmonious calm. It 
soothed him. The dark movings in 
his mind were lessened. 

The female emerged from the 
brush ahead of him, moving slowly, 
cautiously. She stopped and looked 
him over. She bore scars on her 
hind flank but they were well 
healed. He thought he saw sorrow 
in her eyes, a helpless hope of 
comfort. He wanted her to turn 
and walk away. There was some- 
thing terrifying in her calmness — 
an innocence that was not born of 
ignorance. She moved evenly, and 
slowly while he stood still trying to 
deny a building fear that grew as 
she came pleadingly close. 

She stood uncertain now, wor- 
ried. In a moment she would be 
afraid. He moved forward and nuz- 
zled her. 

A WONDROUS night! A night 
brimming with light and confi- 
dence, of hope reconceived. He had 
never hoped for a night such as 
this, he could never have imagined 
the joy he suddenly knew as 
wonderfully real. They played 
under the stars like pups, almost 
delirious at their release. The world 
had taken on a newness. Innocence 
was everywhere. 

She was kind and joyful. If she 
grew passionate it was in thankful- 



126 



IF 




ness for the end of a long and 
craven denial. Such things as she 
had known she had not been meant 
to have experienced. But that she 
had suffered endeared her more to 
him. They felt a silent sharing of 
things long known. 

At last they rested, warm in the 
brightness of starnight. 



T he day was coming. With it re- 
turned the urgency, the fear of 
the coming light. 

He knew again the anguish of 
needing and saw it reflected in her. 
The light would be growing soon 
and they delayed. There was 
urgency, danger. Instincts howled 
in opposition and none could be 
ignored. 

The hunter’s mind snapped to 
certainty. He scrambled into a run 
and, with one look to make sure 
she followed, doubled his speed to 
that of a full pursuit. 

The light was growing. 

They spent that day in his 
burrow in the pit — and many days 
thereafter. 

She had hesitated when he had 
leaped into the pit. But she had 
followed. She had trembled as the 
day grew, flooding the inside of the 
pit with a maddening brilliance. 
She whimpered in fright when the 
dayhunters came. She had never 
been so intensely aware of danger, 
but she stayed with him. She drew 
on his composure. The danger was 
outside, all too real, but here she 



was safe. He made her feel safe. 
She wanted to feel safe. 

And where the burrow doubled 
back on itself he made her feel 
warm, and she slept. 

He emerged from the burrow 
into the night with a waking joy. 
There had been a great change in 
the world. They hunted that night 
with a vibrant sense of being alive 
neither had known before. 

H OW the idea spread can never 
be completely ascertained. 
The pit was near the tunnel, and in 
time became well known. The 
burrow was not overlooked either 
and more than once he had to chase 
out a casual trespasser. But how 
anyone realized the purpose of the 
pit-burrow is unknown. 

But in time another couple 
joined them in the pit. Neither 
couple used their burrows as 
permanent hoities — they were still 
a bit too bright for comfortable 
sleeping. Nonetheless, they used 
them often. And if few adults were 
able to understand the pit-burrows, 
the pups learned quickly. 

Pups there were. They grew 
strong and healthy and only a few 
died. 

At night they would play in the 
pit or come hunting. The pups were 
often amusing in their attempts at 
the business of hunting, occasion- 
ally exasperating, but every so of- 
ten they surprised him. They would 
cause him to wonder if he had 
grown up so fast. 



HABITS OF THE RIGELI AN NIGHTFOX 



127 




And he knew nights when he 
would look about the pit and see 
that there was room left to fit 
another burrow. A few adult 
mates, a few pups who were no 
longer pups had joined them there. 
Some had even made their per- 
manent homes in the pit, though 
how they could sleep well in the 
daylight was beyond him. 

He and his mate had many pups, 
many beautiful nights, many warm 
days. He grew older than many and 
lived to help build the second pit. 

On one pleasant night he went 
hunting alone, leaving pups, mate 
and friends for the beauty of a 
solitary night, the love of the stars. 

He spent a long time in 
wandering, scenting, enjoying the 
night. Such things had always 
promised him joy — now they gave 
more than ever. He felt that things 
had changed. Perhaps there was 
more beauty in the world — or less 
danger. 

He noted a scent and traced it 
with a skill sharpened by long 
practice. He approached the bush 
quietly, stopped and searched it 
carefully. The dayhunter was well 
concealed and dozing soundly. He 
moved cautiously to the base of the 
bush. He waited quietly, judging 
how best to make his leap. Then 
moving a bit to one side and 
tensing, he leaped, grabbed the 
dayhunter by a hind leg and 
dragged it down. 

The dayhunter landed on top of 
him, claws and teeth ripping first 



air, then flesh. He struggled to 
regain his advantage and lost. 



I T WAS then that I broke con- 
tact with him. 

You can probably barely begin 
to realize the grief I felt to see him 
die like any other member of his 
race. I knew him intimately, 
though he never knew me or 
suspected that he was being 
studied. In the years I spent on 
Rigel IV I had made many 
contacts, known many alien minds, 
but his was the one I learned the 
greatest respect for. 

In the history of every intelligent 
species there are but a few of his 
kind, each a transition point in the 
events that determine success or 
failure of a life form. 

When I arrived on Rigel the 
nightfox colony was failing. I 
concerned myself with studying 
the natural decline of a species. But 
before I left the pit-dwellers were 
established and growing at a 
healthy rate and I had witnessed — 
and recorded for the first time — a 
major behavioral change in an 
animal community in its natural 
state. Without my help or that of 
any other life form he had been 
able to extract hope for his race 
from a whim of chance. 

It was luck beyond reasoning 
that our minds ever met. I can only 
feel grateful to have known him so 
well, to have shared the mind of a 
primary genius. •

B.ALAN BURHOE 

S CHADOW was awakened by 
his woman. 

He sat up from the blankets of 
marsh cotton, stretching his 
wings above his head until they 



touched the low ceiling of woven 
reeds. 

“The skyhunter is dying,” she 
said. “We must leave.” 

His heart twisted. “Dying? Are 
you sure?” 

“See for yourself.” She turned to 
gather their meager possessions in 
her thin arms. 

He left their cabin and knew the 
truth of her words even before he 
had reached the forward open- 
ing. He felt the skyhunter’s fad- 
ing life in the uneasy quivering 
that shook the wood framework of 
the gondola. He cursed. Anger 
flared, turning to rage, fading to a 
sinking feeling of impotence. 

A pale yellow tentacle curled 
through the opening. The amber 
eye at its tip regarded him. 

“Ah, my ponderous friend. 
What is the matter?” Schadow 
asked soothingly. 

The tentacle wrapped about his 
waist, reassuring, sad. 

On reaching the opening, he 
looked out and up. The hydrogen- 
filled balloon-bladder that kept 
the skyhunter airbore had turned 
from a healthy crimson to a dusky 
brown, run with streaks of copper. 
The airpaddles were clenched as 
if in pain. The cartilage ribs to 
which the framework of the 
gondola was fastened sagged, 
hardly capable of holding it or 
the hundred and seven human 
members of the Seacliff Clan. 
The sixty green and crimson fish- 



129 




ing tentacles hung lifeless toward 
the glittering sea a halMcilo- 
meter below. The single fore- 
tentacle that had greeted him 
snaked away and moved listlessly 
in the air. He wanted to say some- 
thing, to reassure the animal, the 
living dirigible that had been his 
home and friend and protector all 
his life, to let his calm voice — 

“Schadow.” 

He turned, recognized the old 
man who stood behind him. 
“Grandfather?” 

“There is little time. You must 
move fast.” 

“And you?” 

“You know my duty. We have 
lived as x)ne, the skybeast and 
I — we will die as one. Yon are now 
Clan Elder. You know what you 
must do.” 

Schadow nodded. For a mo- 
ment they clasped hands, Schad- 
ow studying the patriarch’s tired, 
rawhide face. Then he went back 
to his cabin. Behind him. Grand- 
father jumped into the air and flut- 
tered up to the head of the sky- 
hunter., It tried to push him away 
but the ancient one found power in 
his wings and stayed close, patting 
the head and talking softly of yes- 
teryear. 

S CHADOW gathered the clan at 
the aft opening and when he was 
sure that he had had missed no one, 
ordered his people into the sky. 
One by one they jumped, arms 
tightly grasping children or be- 



longings. Their wings flapped until 
they hit an upcurrent — then they 
glided into formation, armed men 
taking the vulnerable positions. 
Last to leave was Schadow. He 
threw himself from the gondola, 
falling toward the distant water, 
stretched his wings, flew. 

Together, silent, they headed to- 
ward the land until Schadow 
judged they had reached a safe dis- 
tance. 

He looked back at the skyhunter. 

The bladder was now almost 
totally copper. The three hydro- 
gen bags were scarcely visible 
through the once transparent hide. 
As the wind pivoted the derelict 
sky beast Schadow saw Grand- 
father flying close to its head. He 
saw the creature give one last at- 
tempt to push the old man away 
with its tentacle, saw it fail, saw 
them grasp one another one last 
time, enemies once, now broth- 
ers. 

“It’s going to suicide,” said one 
warrior. 

Before he had spoken the last 
word a spark flared in the depths of 
the bladder. The skyhunter was 
enveloped in a savage burst of fire 
that reflected softly off the wispy 
clouds above and more fiercely off 
the sea below. Man, beast and 
gondola became a single inferno 
that twisted in the air and tumbled 
into the waves. 

The thunder struck at the Sea- 
cliff Clan, enveloped and passed it. 

For a few moments the flyers 



130 



IF 




were given increased lift. They 
took advantage of it and glided in 
silence toward the granite shore. 

A pack of winged amphibians, 
like tiny pale dragons, soared out 
from the cliffs to meet them, 
screaming their challenge and 
bravado, voicing them ail the 
louder when they were ignored. 

‘*Where do we go now?” asked 
his woman as Schadow glided in 
next to her. 

“Give me my harness,” he said,- 
partly answering her query. 

He took the harness of leather 
straps and silver buckles and 
dressed himself in midair, fitting 
the fastenings around his chest and 
placing the scabbard along his 
spine. He pulled out the sword of 
strong white bone and tested its 
edges, honed over the years to 
razor sharpness. 

“You must go to Starport,” he 
called to his people. “Wait there 
for five days. If I have not re- 
turned by that time you will know 
that I have failed to tame a sky- 
hunter and that you must choose a 
new Clan Elder from among you.” 

He said nothing more. Nothing 
else was left to say. 

They flew away, a few lifting 
their spirits from the depths of the 
tragedy enough to wish him luck. 
He watched them until they 
seemed no larger than insects 
against the brightening blue of 
the post-dawn horizon. Then he 
banked, caught the thermal that 
swept up from the coastal cliffs. 



dropped into an easy glide to con- 
serve his energy for the ordeal 
ahead. 

T hey had called the colony 
world Pishkun, from an ancient 
Sioux word that meant cliff, for in- 
deed it was a land of cliffs as well 
as rift valleys, crevices and faults 
— a granite world of eternal up- 
heaval where the thunder of earth- 
quakes was as common as the roar 
of the ocean. When the colonists 
had first reached and named 
Pishkun they had taken its un- 
friendly nature as a challenge. 
Thus, after a million years of frus- 
trated dreams that had begun when 
early man had First looked at the 
eagle and felt envy, Ornith- 
anthropus had Finally been born, 
for only in the air could life be sus- 
tained with any permanency on this 
world. 

Aesthetics had played a greater 
part in the design of the birdfolk 
than functional engineering. The 
wings had been placed at the shoul- 
der blades and were powered by a 
complex system of muscles that 
started at the keel-like breastbone, 
joined the trapezius and ran up the 
lower part of each wing. The bones 
were hollow for lightness and the 
lower eyelids, which were trans- 
parent, could cover the eyes to pro- 
tect them from windblast. To a 
basicform human, the birdfolk 
were the symbol of beauty in mo- 
tion. 

Schadow, who was of the fif- 



ORNITHANTHROPUS 



131 




tieth generation of his kind, cared 
little for the history of his people. 
He knew it — the basicforms at 
Starport had told it to him when 
he had visited that antigrav trading 
station in his adolescence — but he 
had found the story only of peri- 
pheral interest. Only life, health, 
the sky, his woman and the sky- 
hunter he must tame meant any- 
thing to him. 

The day passed into early after- 
noon without tiring him as he 
skimmed along the updrafts and 
climbed for a wider view. Over the 
sea almost a kilometer away he 
saw a young skyhunter, shining 
like a blood jewel over the silver- 
streaked greeness of the. waves. But 
it was already fishing. It would be 
too strong for him to outlast. He 
looked inland. 

The nostrils of his knife-blade 
nose flared. The muscles in his 
sunken cheeks tightened like 
braided rawhide. His eyes slitted 
and the greasy black hair lifted 
from his scalp. Unsteadily he 
moved the sword in his hands. 
What he saw was barely a dot on 
the horizon but every instinct in 
him identified it. It was a sky- 
hunter heading for the sea and 
therefore hungry, therefore 
weakened. 

For a scant moment he debated 
falling toward the land and forag- 
ing for something to eat, then 
tossed the idea aside. The beast 
would know by his smell whether 
or not he had a full belly and it had 



best sense that he was as hungry as 
it, unarmed except for the sword, 
naked except for the har- 
ness — equal with it in all respects 
including courage. 



H e studied every facet of 
the land and air around him. 
The ground was a tumbled mess of 
bare rock, strewn boulders, cas- 
cades, bogs and patches of brown 
and green where simple land 
plants had eked out a living despite 
the endless assaults upon them by 
the planet’s ever-changing crust. 
He looked away from the tortured 
land. With a sense ingrained into 
him through generations of run- 
ning upon the winds he looked at 
the air mass around him and map- 
ped every current in his mind. He 
saw the draft that swept up from 
the sea cliffs below him like a sun- 
warmed glass curtain to touch the 
inversion layer four kilometers 
above; saw a large thermal off to 
his right, marked where it started 
on the ground near a dust devil, a 
huge cylinder of moving bubbles 
of heated air that rose to reach the 
cumulus clouds that dotted the 
sky; saw a second curtain-like 
current rise from cjiffs of red gran- 
ite to his left, but this one bent and 
rushed dangerously across the 
jagged top; saw the bulk of dead 
air that sat ahead of him, shim- 
mering now and then in the form 
of a seaward breeze. 

He couldn’t have picked a bet- 



132 



IF 




ter place to meet the skybeast, he 
told himself. 

It would not retreat inland or go 
to the left because of the cliffs. It 
could only attempt to go over him 
or to his right— or through him. 

It came on without evidencing 
the slightest concern. As it drew 
closer Schadow was awed at its 
size — it was bigger than any he 
had ever seen. 

The massive bladder, shining 
dull crimson in the sunlight, must 
have been fully forty meters across 
and almost a hundred long. The 
three hydrogen sacs inside flut- 
tered larger and smaller as it ad- 
justed its buoyancy in the we^ak 
on-sea winds. Sixteen airpad- 
dles, eight along each side swept 
forward like closed fists, opened to 
reveal strong black membranes, 
pushed back to provide thrust. 
Fishing tentacles were coiled 
close to the cartilage ribbing that 
protected two-thirds of its under- 
side from leaping sea carnivores. 
The poison-celled foretentacle 
that flipped about the bladder to 
watch for predators or parasites 
was set just behind the head which 
took up the other third. And its 
eyes — they looked across at 
him — were twin pools of molten 
amber, the black pupils expand- 
ing and contracting to the beat of 
the aerial supercoelenterate’s sav- 
age life systems. They revealed a 
brooding intelligence that at 
once terrified and exhilarated 
him Schadow. 



He hovered as best he could in 
the skyhunter's path. 

The creature slowed, watching 
him. Schadow gave challenge. 

“Ho! Skyhunter! I have come to 
tame you, to form the bond of 
brotherhood between us for the 
good of my people — or die try- 
mg. 

The eyes burned into his. 

The foretentacle streaked for 
him. 

S CHADOW swung his sword as 
he had practiced since he had 
first taken to wing as a boy, slash- 
ing the air in front of him in a ser- 
ies of hissing sweeps. He want^ 
the beast to know that he could cut 
the tentacle in two if it threatened 
him but that he didn't want to. 

The tentacle retreated. The eyes 
studied him, their look now un- 
readable. For an instant some- 
thing flashed in those eyes. Then 
the creature was moving. 

At first he thought it was re- 
treating and the concept shocked 
him, for every skyhunter he had 
ever known or heard of would 
rather have suicided than run from 
an attacker, especially such a lit- 
tle attacker as a man. Then a gulp- 
ing sound came to his ears. He 
smiled. It was increasing its 
buoyancy. It was going to attempt 
to go over him. 

Schadow pushed at the almost 
still air with his wings and began 
to climb. The skybeast, airpad- 
dles sweeping lazily to maintain 



ORNITHANTHROPUS 



133 




equilibrium, began to ascend in 
front of him. 

They went up and up until the 
clouds seemed to disappear as 
they melded into them and ice crys- 
tals danced about them, flicker- 
ing brilliantly as they caught and 
broke the sunlight. Shadow’s ex- 
haled breath began to form into 
puffs of frost. The tentacle again 
darted toward him and again he 
created a protective shield around 
him with hiis sword. 

“Ho! You will have to do better 
than that, great one.” 

He watched the tentacle retreat 
and snap in the air as if in anger. 

With a mutter the coelenterate 
began to descend, its hydrogen 
already cooling and decreasing 
its lift. Schadow paralleled it. 

The clouds reformed above. The 
atmosphere became warmer. 

Schadow flexed his wings to 
spoil his descent and was amazed 
to discover that this adversary was 
picking up downward speed. He 
allowed himself to fall with it un- 
til he was forced to brake. 

Surely the thing wasn’t going to 
dash itself into the ground! He felt 
himself go cold in a way the high 
frost couldn’t have affected him. 

It was indeed throwing itself at 
the twisted rock country. Shaken, 
the birdman watched it drop until 
it was falling away from him like a 
plummeting boulder. It hit the 
earth, narrowly missing a jagged 
outcropping. Dust billowed from 
the impact site. The crimson 



bladder shook, flattened, ap- 
peared to burst. Then it was re- 
bounding back up at him. 

Schadow would have laughed in 
relief and admiration for the 
creature if it had not been lofting 
directly at him with tremendous 
speed. He wheeled, pushing the 
air in desperation. It rushed past 
him. The foretentacle narrowly 
missed him and one of the Fishing 
tentacles touched his left leg. He 
cried out in pain. 

Stubbornly he wheeled again and 
chased it until it leveled off at four 
hundred meters. 

He checked his leg. A thin welt 
was forming across his calf. Luck- 
ily he hadn’t been hooked on one of 
the barbs or touched by a poison 
capsule. 

“Ho-eee!” he shouted, making 
the traditional sign of admira- 
tion for one’s enemy in the air with 
his sword. In turn, the skyhunter 
whipped its tentacle about in a re- 
markable mimicry of the sign. 

They settled down to eyeing one 
another again. 

Now perhaps the skybeast 
realized that it and Schadow must 
face each other, that each must 
prove to the other his courage and 
powers of endurance. And while 
they strained to endure the ordeal 
perhaps a bond would form be- 
tween them. 

The huge eyes suddenly shifted 
and focused behind his right 
shoulder. 

Schadow looked around.

IF 




S EVEN armed men stared at 
him. 

Their wings fluttered feebly, 
their weight being supported by 
antigrav units strapped to their 
chests. They gripped swords of the 
best alloy metal. On their bodies 
they wore glittering collections 
of useless ornaments and gad- 
gets. 

Fangs! Schadow remembered 
seeing packs of them when he had 
visited Starbase and he had heard 
many tales of their bloody raids. 
While they were adapted forms, 
the fangs preferred the sanctuary 
of the floating plastic city, ventur- 
ing forth only for murder or pill- 
age. 

One flew slightly ahead of the 
others. Setting a dial on his anti- 
grav, he hovered about ten meters 
from Schadow, alternately watch- 
ing the lone warrior and the sky- 
hunter. 

“I am Garp,” he said. 

“So?” Schadow hefted his sword 
and tentatively tested its edge 
with his thumb. He looked over 
his shoulder to check the beast. 
Though he acted calmly, he strain- 
ed all the while to maintain his 
hovering position without ap- 
pearing to tire. 

“I am leader of our pack.” Garp 
had an artificially bronzed skin, a 
fat belly and shining bald head. He 
reminded Schadow of a Buddha 
idol — perhaps ancient religions 
were the latest fashion among the 
basicforms, whom the fangs al- 



ways emulated, body sculpture 
being the dominant art form 
among the non-adapted men of 
the Confederacy. 

“Then it is up to you to lead your 
men — if they deserve that 
title — away. You should know that 
the ordeal with a skyhunter is a 
private matter. You have no right 
here.” 

Garp laughed. 

“But we have come such a long 
way to find you. Ven here,” he 
swept his empty hand toward a 
thinner version of himself who 
grinned and bowed awkwardly in 
the air, “saw your people arrive 
at the base and overheard them 
talking about you.” Now it was 
Garp’s turn to test his sword edge 
with his thumb, though Schadow 
saw sky between flesh and metal. 
“Having nothing better to do, we 
decided that we should come out 
and help you. I mean, all that talk 
that you people keep giving us 
about living with nature and not 
against it to to the contrary, we 
thought that you’d like the power 
of civilization behind you in this 
affair.” He looked at the beast, 
briefly meeting its eyes. His voice 
went softer. “I’ve never ^een a man 
killed by one of those before.” 
Garp looked at his sword then 
shouted, “Ven!” 

“Ho?” 

“The triplets will stay with me. 
You take the other two and go be- 
hind the thing to keep it from get- 
ting away.” 



ORNITHANTHROPUS

“Understood.” The three ad- 
justed their antigravs and pushed 
themselves into position. 

Garp looked at Schadow. 
“You.” 

Schadow felt his jaw muscles 
tighten in anger. 

“In my wide experience in deal- 
ing with men of action, I have 
usually found that even the bravest 
need a little push in the right di- 
rection on occasion. We watched 
you fighting the thing and it is our 
considered opinion that you keep 
too far from it. Right men?” 

The trio that moved in behind 
hin answered in chorus, “Right.” 

“So let’s give him the courage he 
needs.” Garp waited until the three 
were even with hinv^before mov- 
ing slowly toward the warrior, 
sword held out ahead of him like a 
lance. 

S CHADOW held his position. 

Garp had slowed so that two 
others were the first to reach him. 
Folding his wings, Schadow fell. 
He outstretched them again and 
regained altitude, slashing at one 
fang who had just set his antigrav 
to dive and had left the top of his 
head vulnerable. He felt his sword 
crack through the skull. The man 
screamed and floated away from 
the contestants. 

He slashed at the second man, 
missing him by millimeters. 

Garp screamed in rage. “Kill 
him,” he ordered. 

The other two didn’t need en- 



couraging. They rushed at 
Schadow. 

He parried the lunging weapon 
of the first, ducked the second and 
looked for Garp. The latter proved 
to be a greater danger than 
Schadow had guessed. The fang 
leader held his sword before him, 
elbow locked, and maneuvered 
himself by twisting the dials on his 
antigrav. He flashed in and out 
with extreme accuracy and 
Schadow learned respect for the 
antigrav as he desperately put up 
a defense. The other two pressed 
beside him, forcing him to fall 
back toward the skyhunter. 

“Yen,” shouted Garp. “Drive 
the thing this way.” 

Schadow looked behind him. 
Yen and his companions were ef- 
ficiently moving the skybeast to- 
ward him. Not that he feared the 
skyhunter so much — though he 
knew what his fate would be if it 
caught him — but he felt concern 
that the flashing blades would 
soon cripple the animal. It was 
battling with a ferocity it had not 
shown earlier. Its fishing tentacles 
lashed out as it rocked in the air. 
Its foretentacle hung poised to 
strike. Its paddles sent it spinning 
on an axis, making it harder to 
predict its next attack or parry. 
Even so, it didn’t have a chance 
against this pack. The fact that its 
fiery suicide — when it accepted de- 
feat — would take its tormentors 
with it was little consolation. 

Something nagged at the back of 



136 



IF 




Schadow’s mind but the fangs gave 
him no time to find out what it was. 
His keel muscles were blazing with 
pain as he was forced to beat his 
wings to hold his position. He 
could feel himself weakening. 
For the first time in his life he 
envied the power the antigrav gave 
a flyer, as his attackers pressed 
themselves more keenly against 
him. His sword of bloodied bone 
took the full force of a downward 
stroke from above and was 
chipped. He stabbed at Garp, who 
replied by smashing Schadow’s 
sword with a jarring blow that 
broke the point. Cursing, Schadow 
put his full fury into an offense, 
momentarily driving the three 
back. Garp lost his temper and for 
the first time truly led the attack. 
They came at him at once. 

The wind shimmered and the 
birdman saw a brief updraft roll 
up to them like a pearl-gray bub- 
ble. He flexed his wings. The warm 



bubble enveloped them, jostling 
the fangs and lifting their inteded 
victim above them. Spitting 
monosyllables, the trio adjusted 
their antigravs and shot toward 
him. 

Schadow, momentarily relieved 
from battle and able to rest his 
burning muscles, was amazed. Had 
they been so busy that they hadn’t 
seen the thermal? But surely they 
must have. No matter how in- 
volved you were, you always 
watched the air about you. You 
had to if you wanted to fly. 

Garp and the others were at him 
again. His weapon rendered use- 
less as a foil, he was forced to slash 
and chop at them. He scratched 
Garp’s bronze belly, forcing him 
behind the other two. 



H e saw a second thermal bub- 
ble coming up at them. Wing- 
ing over, he dived. The fangs fell

it is you're in^ Then read —

beside him. When he leveled off, 
they leveled beside him, prepared 
to continue the fight. The thermal 
hit and again he was carried away 
from them. 

They couldn’t see! It was a hard 
fact to understand but there was 
the proof. Any child of Schadow’s 
clan would have seen that bubble 
and yet these winged adults had 
looked right at it without noticing 
it. Was it possible? He watched 
them coming up at him, playing 
with the knobs on their antigravs. 

He saw the truth and with it a 
possibility. These men, adapted 
for the air though they were, were 
creatures of the Starbase, where 
no man ever did what a mechanism 
could more easily do. Even though 
they had flown the skies all their 
lives, they had never really flown. 
Using their wings only as sta- 
bilizers, they let their antigravs do 
their flying for them. Not having 
the need to know the currents of 
the atmosphere, they had lost, if 
they had ever had, the ability to see 
them. In a very important way 
they were blind. 

Again Schadow dived. This time 
he looped low and under the trail- 
ing tentacles of the skyhunter. The 
fangs reset their equipment and 
gave easy chase. 

“Ven — ” shouted Garp. 

Ven looked down and peeled 
away from the troubled skyhunter, 
followed by his comrades. 

The six formed a rough flock 
behind Schadow. 



Banking to his left, he put his 
last dregs of energy into flying for 
the red cliffs. 

As his pursuers closed the dis- 
tance between them he regarded 
the bleak cliffs and the wispy 
blanket of air that rose up and over 
it. Every instinct cried out to him 
to veer away. 

He reached the outer edge of the 
blanket and soared upward, the 
wind brushing his face gently and 
with no hint of where it would take 
him if he stayed with it. The pack 
adjusted and rose behind him. 
Ven was leading and only five 
meters below, his teeth showing in 
a tight grin. 

Ven overtook him as they 
reached the summit and Schadow 
was carried across the rough top. 
With one hand on his antigrav Ven 
threw himself at the birdman. 

Schadow met sword with sword. 
As Ven pulled back to make a sec- 
ond stab, Schadow somersaulted 
beneath him and slashed up- 
ward. Blood spurted past his face. 
Ven screamed and twisted in the 
air, held aloft by his device. 

The second attacker was luck- 
ier. His sword caught Schadow’s 
at an angle, breaking it just above 
the guard. Schadow tossed the 
handle into the man’s face. 

Shouting in victory, Garp moved 
in ahead of the others for the kill. 

“Die, you — ’’ he yelled, raising 
his weapon. His eyes burned.

HOT mRLO 



The rule of the Brains was harsh^ 
but so was Mew Eden. Only spedal 
types of men could survive there! 



K REG TOMSUN, face set in 
disdainful lines so the curious 
citizens wouldn’t guess the sick 
dread inside him, walked as slowly 
as the two nervous lawkeeps let 
him. He put down wild thoughts of 
making a break at this last 
moment. Insane! Where would he 
run? 

Two blocks ahead Nose Cone, 
the colony’s seat of government— 
as well as its arsenal and main 
power plant for the century and 
a half since Landing — loomed 
like an immense steel bullet 
against the blinding straw-col- 
ored New Eden sky. How well 
he knew that silhouette! Just be- 
yond Nose Cone was the obtuse 
angle of South Fence in which 
Landington nestled. Beyond the 
fence rose Desolation Ridge, 
the weather barrier that split the 
relatively fertile colony land from 
Hidry Desert. Though the season 
was still spring, the kitchgrass was 
already bleached to a dirty white, 
and the gullies were baked dry. 

Beyond the ridge lay his almost 
certain exile. 



One of the lawkeeps, a careful 
four paces behind, said, “Step it 
up, Tomsun!’’ 

The attendant at Access Four 
flushed and averted his eyes, ob- 
viously u.nwilling to remember 
Kreg now. Kreg walked past him 
and stood blinking for a moment in 
the dimmer light of Rotunda. The 
sensors detected him quickly. A 
voice said, “This is Captain Ger- 
lik. Since you were apprenticed to 
Nose Cone, Tomsun, I’m going 
to hear you myself. You know my 
compartment.’’ 

“Yes, sir.’’ Kreg ignored the 
startled glances of citizens; there 
were few because this was neither a 
Lecture Day nor a Museum Day. 
He crossed the high-vaulted cham- 
ber to a door a third of the way 
around the circumference, pushed 
it open and descended the ramp. 
One deck down, he left the ramp 
via another door and walked along 
a cross-ship corridor. He could feel 
under his feet the vibration of ma- 
chinery two decks down and hear 
the familiar hums. How long, he 
wondered absently as he had so of- 



139 





ten, would the fissionables last? 
And what would the colony do for 
power when they were gone? 

There were no ’pairbots in the 
corridor. He pushed open the door 
of Compartment NC Six, entered 
and stood facing the stainless-steel 
cabinet against the outboard bulk- 
head. 

M an height, the rectangular 
compartment was. The lower 
part was featureless — he knew 
there was machinery in it, and 
some free space. At face* height 
were six orifices in a horizontal 
row — the outer two, the ears, 
about eight inches apart; the in- 
ner, the eyes, about three inches 
apart. The other twj? were for 
smelling. Below the line of ori- 
fices was the voice-grill. There 
were, of course, other sensors in 
various parts of the room, as well 
as unseen weapons, but the cab- 
inet’s particular sensory organs 
were placed to give the preserved 
Brain inside as nearly a human 
viewpoint as possible. 

Captain Gerlik, as the history 
books told, had been only Third 
Officer, but he was senior of the 
surviving Brains. One would think, 
Kreg mused sourly, that some dis- 
tinction would be displayed. But 
this compartment and this cabinet 
were identical with the other four. 

The voice from the grill was 
Gerlik’s. “Sit down, Tomsun.” 
Kreg slid into the single plain 
chair. He stared defiantly at the 
cabinet’s features. 

140 



The voice, when it came again, 
sounded bored. “Tomsun, as you 
know, you’re entitled to this last 
hearing. Are there new facts you 
want to present?’’ 

Kreg sat wordless for a minute. 
Finally he shrugged. “I didn’t hide 
anything before.’’ 

The voice sighed. “All right; I’ll 
state what’s ort record. One hun- 
dred twenty-six planetary days ago 
you were arrested for fist-fighting. 
Ninety-seven days ago you were 
arrested on an identical charge. 
That being your second citation,* 
you were given Formal Warning." 

The sick feeling in Kreg's 
stomach made him shift in the 
chair. “The two situations were not 
identical!’’ 

Gerlik said impatiently, “1 have 
access to your testimony, and that 
of witnesses. In the first instance, a 
man jostled you and made 
threatening remarks. You replied 
and soon you were trading 
punches. In the second instance, 
several members of a gang, as you 
called it, goaded you into fighting 
by making remarks about your 
courage or lack of it. Those were 
the circumstances. The charges 
were identical." 

Kreg shrugged. 

The Brain went on, “And now 
there’s a third charge. I suppose 
you’re going to say the circum- 
stances are again different.’’ 



K reg sat stonily for a mo- 
ment. He had refused to talk 

IF 




at the last trial — witnesses had said 
enough. Now, though, he faced ex- 
ile .. “They were different, if you 
care. There was — I was with a 
young lady and another fellow tried 
to — to cut in. He knew I had re- 
ceived a Formal Warning, so he 
thought rd be afraid to fight.” 
Gerlik sounded amused. “But 
you weren’t, of course, and you 
swung a fist.” 

Kreg said, “He swung one first.” 
“And,” Gerlik said, “it was 
thereupon incumbent upon you to 
punch back?” 

Kreg’s face grew warmer. 
“That’s how most of us feel.” 
“Whom do ygu mean by ‘us’?” 
“Young men of my age.” 

“Which is?” 

Kreg said — a little angrily be- 
cause his age was on file, “Nine- 
teen.” 

Rather young aren’t you?” 

Kreg clamped his lips on a hot 
reply. He mustn’t let himself be 
needled into saying what was in his 
mind. 

The voice continued. “We’ll let 
that pass, since you seem to con- 
sider yourself old enough to break 
the law. Were either you or the 
young lady in physical danger?” 
Kreg said impatiently, “Of 
course not. The incident was a — a 
deliberate challenge to my man- 
hood. I don’t see what a thing like 
this, a simple fist-fight between 
two young men, has to do with law. 
It isn’t as if — as if I’d taken a pis- 
tol and shot someone through the 



head — or broken into a house and 
stolen something!” 

G ERLIK’S mechanical voice 
sighed. “Obviously you 
haven’t listened to the things we’ve 
tried to teach you. So listen now. 
We have close to nine thousand 
people in the colony. Survival 
isn’t easy — New Eden is not a fer- 
tile planet — and will get harder as 
we grow. Violent people aren’t 
the type we need. We need people 
willing to cooperate. The al- 
ternative is more and more law- 
keeps and more and more of the 
colony’s potential, wasted. Mat- 
ters are bad enough at this point. 
Do you know the colony’s aver- 
age growth over the last twenty- 
five years?” 

Kreg said impatiently, “A third 
of a percent a year.” 

“Right.” The voice fell briefly 
silent. “Tomsun, such a statistic 
may mean nothing to you. To 
us — to the Brains — it’s highly dis- 
tressing. We’re not going to live 
/ forever and the fissionables won’t 
last forever. A time limit exists^ 
Within it we must build a colony 
capable of surviving on its own. 
Its people must not collapse into 
wars and anarchy. Here’s a sta- 
tistic, Tomsun, that you may not 
have heard — we’ve had to exile, 
for various kinds of violence or 
other antisocial behavior, a little 
over one-half of one percent of to- 
tal population per year! At pres- 
ent we’re shrinking, not growing. 



HOT WORLD 



141 




There’s a dilemma — do we ruth- 
lessly weed out the unsuitable, or 
do we keep the marginal ones in 
favor of growth?” 

K REG waited sullenly for the 
voice to resume. When it 
didn’t he said, ”lt seems to me you 
go pretty far toward weeding out 
anyone with a little spirit.” 

Gerlik caught him up. “Spirit? 
Have we ever exiled anyone for 
peaceful competition? Do we 
prohibit arguing as long as noth- 
ing harder than words is thrown?” 
“No, but — well, you’re damned 
hard on girls!” 

The voice sighed. “Now you’re 
talking about morals. Qf course, 
we uphold moral standards — 
they’re part and parcel of the kind 
of society we need. Tomsun, we’re 
wandering from your own case. 
Do you have any new facts to pre- 
sent?” 

“No.” 

“Then the sentence will have to 
stand. Exile,” 

Kreg found himself on his feet. 
“Why don’t you just shoot me? 
Why maintain this farce of exile? 
Do you think it’s civilized to let 
people starve outside or go blind 
from the sun, die of thirst or be 
killed by predators?” 

“Or,” the voice said calmly, 
“kill each other. Don’t forget that 
part. Yes, we’re being civilized. 
We’re sparing your fellow colo- 
nists the job of executing you or 
of guarding and supporting you 



in prison — or caring for you after 
a brainwashing. And you don’t 
have to die automatically once 
you’re exiled. Exes do survive; 
lots of them. Now, Tomsun, this 
is all the time I can give you. 
When you leave Nose Cone — ” 
Kreg said desperately, “I have 
a right to make a bequest and 
choose an executor.” 

Gerlik sighed. “Choose, then.” 

“I choose my great-uncle!” 

“All right. You know his com- 
partment.” 

II 

NCLE BEN TOMSUN— so 
known to the whole family — 
was the only one of the Brains 
who hadn’t been born either on the 
Ship or on Earth itself. He had 
been born on New Eden and had 
lived there seventy-three years. 

He greeted Kreg quietly. “I 
can’t say how sorry I am. I had 
great hopes for you. Why couldn’t 
you have held your temper? Are 
a few taunts all that important?” 
Kreg, standing, gripped the 
chair back. “Ben, don’t talk like 
the rest of them. Can’t you see 
that it’s not fair? No matter how 
hard I tried, someone would have 
goaded me into fighting. They’d 
hive pushed as far as necessary, 
knowing I had had a Formal 
Warning, and now I’m being pun- 
ished while they — ” 

Ben interrupted quietly, “Hold 
on, boy. They were all cited — 




142 



IF 




even the ones who never touched 
you, only looked on. Some got 
their second citations. They have 
to walk a tightrope from now on. 
And don’t keep calling your sen- 
tence punishment— and don’t call 
it unfair. Wotild it be fair to the 
orderly members of the colony to 
leave violent genes among them? 
Do you think we Brains could die 
knowing we had left the seeds of 
self-destruction in the colony?” 

Kreg said furiously, was 
pushed farther than I could stand. 
I had to fight or — or admit I 
wasn’t a man. Can’t you under- 
stand that?” 

Ben said quietly, “No, I can’t. 
What harm would it have done 
you to have swallowed your pride? 
To my way of thinking to have 
done so would have been the 
greater manhood. Can’t you un- 
“No.” 

“Then you’re not a very bright 
young man.” 

K reg took two trembling 
steps and gripped the chair 
back again. For one red instant he 
wanted to lift it and swing it at the 
cabinet. Not that he could have 
done much harm — if he did suc- 
ceed in breaking an eye the hid- 
den weapons would blast him 
down and ’pairbots or attendants 
would come and carry his remains 
away and repair the sensor. In- 
stead, he spoke in a low, shaky 
voice, “I don’t see it as a question 
of brightness. I’m flesh and blood 



and I react accordingly. While 
you — ” 

Ben said with only a trace of 
sharpness in his artificial voice, 
“While I’m just a glandless hunk of 
protoplasm in a saturated sponge. 
Is that it?” 

Now that it was said, Kreg 
wouldn’t back down. “That’s right. 
You’ve been that way so long you 
can’t remember what it’s like to be 
a man.” 

Ben said coolly, “You wanted to 
make a bequest. Get on with it.” 

Kreg said bitterly, “I own a few 
credits in the bank and some 
clothes. I bequeath the credits to 
you and the other Brains. Maybe 
you can buy some pin-up pictures- 
for your compartment walls. I 
don’t c^re what you do with the 
clothes. Wear them, if you can find 
a way!” He turned and ran out of 
the compartment. 

He thought he heard a chuckle 
behind him. 

T he gravcar settled onto loose 
sandy soil. Kreg stared at the 
quilltrees growing sparsely in a 
shallow ravine that led south- 
ward. His neutral-gray goggles 
did not distort colors, but he could 
see little green in the spiny Joshua- 
treelike things — they were off- 
white like dry old bones. They and 
the kitchgrass were the only veg- 
etation in sight. 

He climbed wordlessly from the 
car and accepted the felt-covered 
canteen and the bundle of rations 



HOT WORLD 



143 




one lawkeep handed him. He al- 
ready had, in a thick compart- 
mented belt, a supply of salt, some 
antibiotic tablets and a burning- 
glass for making fire. The only 
weapon allowed him was a knife in 
a scabbard. 

The second lawkeep said, not un- 
kindly, “That ravine will have 
water a few miles south. You’d bet- 
ter stay here until night, though — 
a group of exes was sighted not 
far down a few days ago. They 
might not be hospitable.” 

Kreg stood and watched the car 
rise, then dart north. A hundred 
and fifty miles was estimate of the 
distance they’d brought him. Too 
to walk back, even if some- 
thing other than a bullet waited at 
the fence. 

He turned listlessly toward the 
ravine. Insects buzzed in saffron 
sunlight made bearable by his 
goggles. The heat was already 
striking through his loose white 
garments. He moved hesitantly to-, 
ward the nearest big quilltree. 
Predators weren’t supposed to 
range this far north, but he wasn’t 
sure. And exiles might ambush 
hirn for the things he had. 

He sat down in the quilltree’s 
slim shadow. Winged insects flew 
away from him. He opened the 
canteen and drank sparingly, 
though the dryness of the air made 
him want to gulp mouthfuls. The 
desert smelled dusty and the quill- 
tree smelled like hot grease. Some- 
thing — those locustlike insects. 



maybe — had an odor of thymol. 

There were no feathered birds on 
New Eden, but now that the 
gravcar was gone things like slen- 
der four-inch winged lizards began 
to flit about, catching insects. 
Kihches, they were called. He had 
heard that starving exes some- 
times ate them. They did not tempt 
him — they looked like tight twists 
of dry gray paper, with cellophane 
wings. 

N ight came and the air cooled 
a little. Neither moon was in 
sight but the stars were brilliant. 

The brightest point of light in the 
sky was not a star. Kreg lay on his 
back, staring up at it. Main Hull, it 
was — practically all of the Ship 
except Nose Cone. Originally it 
had been left in a standing orbit 
directly above Landington, but by 
now it had lagged a little and 
skewed off to the west, so it was 
below the zenith. The living quar- 
ters, schools, clinics and amuse- 
ment centers had been in Main 
Hull, along with most of hydro- 
ponics and ship’s machinery, 
including the main drives. The 
passengers landing in Nose 
Cone, must have been crowded. 
He wondered how long it would be 
before Main Hull’s orbit decayed 
enough to bring it down as a 
meteor. Thousands of years per- 
haps. It seemed a shame to waste 
all that metal, but landing it would 
have used up a lot of fissionables. 
Something — a kinch — crawled

onto his hand. Startled, he threw it 
off, then rose to his feet and moved 
cautiously downravine. 

Mostly, the ground between 
quilltrees was too sandy to support 
much growth, but here and there, 
in richer pockets, kitchgrass grew. 
The individual plant was like a 
small sprout of asparagus with 
five oval leaves arranged radially 
around its base. Where enough 
moisture existed the grass formed 
an almost complete cover. Kreg, 
pausing to peer ahead, stooped, 
plucked one of the sprouts and 
chewed on it. The taste was mildly 
bitter; the texture dry and pithy; 
only when it first sprouted was the 
stuff succulent. After a minute he 
spat it out and took a sip from his 
canteen. Then he trudged on. 

Eight or nine miles downravine, 
where the quilltrees grew more 
thickly, he suddenly stopped, 
crouching beside one of the spiny 
trunks. From ahead came a rumble 
of sound like many feet pounding. 
The sound grew rapidly. Thorough- 
ly scared, he ran for the nearer side 
of the ravine and struggled up the 
loose slope, sliding back one step 
for every two he gained, slipping 
often to hands and knees. Finally, 
gaining level ground, he ran to a 
small hummock and threw him- 
self down beside it where he could 
watch the ravine. In the starlight 
he could see plainly the marks he 
had left on the slope. Dare he 
stay here? 

But it was too late to get up and 



run. A couple of hundred yards 
ahead he saw swift movement 
among the quilltrees. He lay still, 
trying not to breathe audibly — then 
realized that the thunder of the 
stampede would drown out any 
noise he made. 

T hey were hellrunners. He rec-. 

ognized them though he had 
seen only three or four such crea- 
tures in his life from gravcars. 
This closeup view of a whole herd 
was awesome. 

The bodies, from the thrusting 
snouts to the tips of the long heavy 
tails, were as much as fifteen feet 
lohg and reptilian. But unlike the 
Terran crocodiles in old movies, 
these New Eden creatures did not 
crawl on four legs. Instead they ran 
in swift long strides on two 
mightily muscled hind limbs, their 
bodies parallel to the ground and 
fifty inches or more above it, the 
tails balancing the foreparts. 
Great three-toed feet drummed 
upon the soil and sent it flying. 
The relatively puny forelimbs 
were clutched against the pumping 
chests. The heads, hardly bigger 
than a man’s though more elongat- 
ed, swayed on long necks as the 
hurtling creatures swerved among 
the quilltrees and darted looks 
ahead. Kreg shivered, thinking of 
the strength needed to keep those ^ 
heavy bodies balanced parallel to 
the ground. 

Behind the big males in the lead 
came the females and the young.

running more gracefully. A rear 
guard of young males twisted their 
heads about to watch the trail 
behind. Kreg pressed himself close 
to the ground, fearing some mon- 
strous pursuer of the fleeing herd. 
But the last of the herd passed, in- 
cluding a straggler or two, and 
the thunder diminished up the ra- 
vine with no sign of pursuit. 

He lay there until the ravine was 
quiet again, then dusted off his gar- 
ments and began to walk along the 
edge of the slope. He didn’t think 
he wanted to go down among the 
quilltrees again. 

Suddenly figures loomed before 
him. He crouched, reaching hesi- 
tantly for his knife, but a voice 
said, “Hold it right there, newie,’’ 
and he saw spears ready. 

HI 

F or a minute nothing more was 
said and no one moved. Kreg 
gave a start as a menacing bellow 
sounded from upravine. The exile 
who had spoken before — a dark- 
bearded man of perhaps forty, as 
tall as Kreg but very lean— grinned 
in the starlight. “Relax. That’s one 
of our sentries, keeping those hell- 
runners moving. We want the 
ravine to ourselves for a while. 
When did you come out?’’ 

“Abopt noon.’’ 

“What for?’’ 

“Fistfighting.” 

“Oh, yes? Are you pretty good 
with your fists?” 



Kreg shrugged. “I never made a 
study of it. I didn’t look for the 
fights.” 

“I see,” the bearded man said 
casually. “What’s your name?” 

Kreg rejected an impulse to say 
it was none of the man’s business. 
“Tomsun,” 

“Tomsun? Which family are 
you? The one related to the Brain?” 

“That’s right.” 

The spokesman grunted. “Does 
your family still spend a lot of time 
visiting Uncle Ben?” 

Kreg said irritably, “As much as 
ever I guess. Why? Are you a Tom- 
sun?” 

“No. I just wondered if you’d 
been in Nose Cone quite a bit. And 
why Uncle Ben let this happen to 
you.” 

Kreg, his anger at the Brains 
stirring within him, said, “I’ve been 
in and out of Nose Cone since be- 
fore I could pronounce it. The last 
two years I’ve been an apprentice 
attendant. But Uncle Ben seemed 
to agree with the other Brains that 
it’s antisocial for a man to stand up 
to a challenge.” 

The spokesman stared at Kreg. 
Then he muttered something under 
his breath, sighed and said, “All 
right. I’ll tell you how it is with us. 
We’re not the most lawless tribe of 
exes, but we don’t recruit weak- 
lings. You can come in with us ten- 
tatively, but you’ll have to con- 
tribute those supplies you’ve got, 
carry your weight and stick by our 
rules. If you decline, you’ll have to 



146 



IF 




stay away from this ravine. I 
wouldn't swap much for your 
chances in that case." 

Kreg said woodenly, "It doesn't 
sound as if I had much choice. If 
you want the knife and the goggles 
and salt and antibiotics, I guess 
you can take them." 

The spokesman said patiently, 
"We won't take them. We don't 
care to compel anyone to join us. 
We want willing recruits — any 
other kind are too much trouble. 
There's another ravine fifteen 
miles east that you could reach 
before sunup." 

"I guess I’d be a fool to decline 
your offer." 

"Fine," the bearded man said. 
"My name's Pendergast. This is 
Nujent and this is — " 

B efore morning Kreg under- 
stood the stampede of hellrun- 
ners. Pendergast's exes had start- 
ed it. They had with them the in- 
tact cured skins of two huge quad- 
ruped carnivores, somewhat like 
Terran lions in form but much 
bigger add scaly rather than furred. 
Two men in a skin could move it 
fast enough and imitate the living 
beast's bellow well enough to 
stampede a herd of the non-car- 
nivorous hellrunners. In this par- 
ticular instance, the purpose was 
dual: to chase them away from a 
waterhole and to kill a few strag- 
glers for meat. The meat, now siz- 
zling on spits over open fires, tasted 
like chicken, though it was tougher. 



The water in the stagnant pool, 
which was shaded by a thick 
growth of quilltrees and some 
round-leaved shootlike things, had 
to be settled; decanted and boiled 
before it was drinkable. Kreg 
threaded his way along a prickly- 
bordered hellrunner trail to look 
at that pool. He didn't hear 
Pendergast behind him until the 
trek leader spoke. "Wondering 
how water stays here into the dry 
season?" 

"Yes ' 

The bearded man kneeled and 
swished murky water. "The hell- 
runners — or people, now that we’re 
here — keep holes dug out. You’ll 
notice that raised rim of dirt. In a 
low pocket of a ravine like this, 
where quilltrees grow this thick, 
you’ll almost always find ground 
water if you dig down a ways. 
Seepage will keep the hole filled." 

Kreg nodded. "I understand 
there’s an actual lake somewhere 
south." 

"Yes." In the early light Pender- 
gast’s.eyes showed gray and Kreg 
could see a strip of less tanned skin 
across his eyes and nose. "Sixty 
miles downravine. Lake Salva- 
tion, we call it. That’s where our 
tribe is." 

"How big is the tribe?" 

"About four hundred, including 
a few offshoots that live else- 
where." 

"Oh. That big?" Kreg pondered 
a moment. Then: "Isn’t this pretty 
far to come on a hunt?" 



HOT WORLD 



147 




Pendergast looked faintly sur- 
prised. “The hunt’s incidental. We 
are a trading expedition.” 

“What do you trade?” 

“Salt, for one thing — there are 
pockets in the ravine — and water. 
We take metal in return. You’ll be 
going with us, unless you want to 
trek sixty miles downravine 
alone.” 

“No, thanks. Where are we go- 
ing and with whom will we trade?” 
“There are a half-dozen small 
tribes west of here, who mine met- 
als and don’t have salt or enough 
water of their own. We’ll make the 
circuit, then head back down an- 
other ravine to the lake. Now, as to 
your stuff.” The trek- leader 
glanced at Kreg’s belt. “You may 
as well wear that and the goggles 
until we get home. There’ll be 
people at the lake who need the 
goggles worse than you do, but the 
rest of us on this trek are used to 
slits. Nujent will take the knife be- 
cause he knows how to use it bet- 
ter than any of us. Did you ever 
carry a backpack?” 

“No.” 

“It’ll take a little getting used to. 
We won’t give you too much — 
say, about three gallons of water 
plus your own canteen and your 
share of the cooked meat. It won’t 
be an easy trek for you, this first 
time, but you look healthy.” 

Kreg said, “I’ll keep up.” 

K REG brought the strength of 
the expedition to twenty-one. 



He noticed that he was carrying the 
lightest burden — most of the 
others had six or eight gallons of 
water, in thin leather bags that 
didn’t leak or sweat. Still, what he 
had was none too little. The extra 
weight tired him quickly and made 
his feet and his back muscles ache. 
The packstraps rubbed his shoul- 
ders raw. He was always thirsty 
and he hated the caked dust on 
his skin, but he stuck grimly to 
the pint-a-day water ration. 

The slits Pendergast had men- 
tioned were carved wooden goggles 
with horizontal openings. The exes 
seemed to find them little nui- 
sance, but the head-bobbing to 
raise and lower the field of view 
was odd. There were other strange 
things too: the sun fence — a long 
sheet of leather erected on poles 
during daylight stops; the prob- 
ing ahead on downslopes with 
staffs to avoid loose pockets of 
dirt beneath thin crusts; the wind- 
ing routes that took the group to 
leeward of hills. All had the pur- 
pose of avoiding unnecessary 
perspiration; for example, after 
one tumble down a slope, Kreg 
understood the value of the staffs. 

When the country was fairly 
level they traveled at night. When rt 
was not they traveled during the 
day, the better to avoid treacher- 
ous footing and dangerous ani- 
mals. 

Once they did encounter a herd 
of hellrunners. Kreg — because he 
had the goggles — saw them first. 



148 



IF 




The expedition was crossing a ra- 
vine that had only a scattering of 
quilltrees. The big creatures were 
browsing slowly along, heads ris- 
ing and bodies lifting as they nib- 
bled daintily at comparatively 
tender quills atop the trees. He 
must have jerked his head around 
quickly enough to alert Pender- 
gast, for the trek leader was beside 
him at once, gripping his arm. 
“Turn slowly and walk upravine. 
“Don’t hurry and don’t look 
back.” 

Kreg, after a hesitant moment, 
complied. From the corners of his 
goggles he could see the other men 
walking slowly to either side. They 
must have gone a quarter-mile be- 
fore Pendergast said, “All right. 
Out of the ravine now. They’ve de- 
cided we’re no threat.” 

Kreg started up the slope. Sud- 
denly he stopped, staring to his 
right. “Doesn’t that look like — ” 
But Pendergast and others were al- 
ready striding to where Kreg point- 
ed. 

I T WAS a body, all right — that 
of a newie, obviously not long 
dead, dressed as Kreg had been 
when first set down. The expedi- 
tion gathered to stare silently. 

The man— older than Kreg— 
had left tracks from the north. He 
had apparently stopped to sleep 
and something had crept up on 
him. His throat was torn open and 
part of one shoulder was eaten 
away. Blood had soaked into the 



ground. There were fang marks on 
his forearms as if he had tried to 
shield his throat, but the standard 
knife was in its scabbard. 

Pendergast stooped to unbuckle 
the belt. Two other men hoisted the 
corpse so the belt could be pulled 
free. The first thing Pendergast did 
then was unsnap the goggles com- 
partment and take out the goggles, 
which began to darken rapidly, ad- 
justing to the daylight. “I’ll wear 
these if no one objects.” 

The others nodded. Nujent 
picked up the canteen and shook it. 
“He drank most of his water the 
first day.” 

Kreg, resenting the calm accep- 
tance of the tragedy, demanded, 
“How do you know it was only one 
day?” 

Pendergast gave him a glance 
through the newly acquired gog- 
gles. “He’s only one day’s walk 
from where he’d have been set 
down. This seems to bother you. 
Know him?” 

“No, but—” 

The trek leader shrugged. “It’s 
too bad he got himself killed, but it 
was his own fault. He should have 
rested during the day and trekked 
at night, as you did. Then he 
wouldn’t have been sneaked up 
on.” 

Kreg supposed that was so. 
“What killed him?” 

“A gollycat. They skulk around 
herds of hellrunners, picking off 
the young or stragglers. Not the 
biggest predator you’ll see here. 



HOT WORLD 



149 




but the size of leopards. Scaly 
quadrupeds/' 

Kreg said impatiently, “Pve seen 
pictures of them. But this man 
could have been warned more thor- 
oughly, or set down in a safer 
place." 

The exes were all looking at 
Kreg now. After a minute Perfder- 
gast said, ‘There are a couple of 
us here who know how you feel — 

I was exiled myself twelve years 
ago. Most of the others were 
born in the tribe. To them, a new- 
ie doesn’t mean much until he’s 
proved himself. Understand?’’ 

Kreg looked around at the im- 
passive men. "I guess so. But — the 
same thing could have happened 
to me. I wasn’t watned about 
gollycats either. I. thought they 
only lived east of the colony, in the 
Sunrise Hills.’’ 

Nujent, grinning, put in, "We 
aren’t any greater admirers of the 
system, or of the Brains, than you 
are, even if we’ve never talked to 
them. Why do you think we live in 
the desert? The Sunrise Hills aren’t 
as fertile as the colony land, but 
they’re a lot better than this.’’ 

Kreg looked at the slits of Nu- 
jent’s wooden goggles. "I don’t 
know why you live as you do. Why 
do you?’’ 

"Because the Brains won’t let us 
have so much as a rifle to fight off 
predators. And predators are thick 
in the hills. A few years ago an 
uncle of mine got together the 
materials for gunpowder and 



hammered together a crude sort of 
cannon. About the fourth time he 
fired it, lawkeeps from the colony 
descended and took it away.’’ 

Kreg said nothing. That was the 
law, of course— exes could not own 
guns. He hadn’t known, though, 
that exiles had ambition enough, 
or organization enough, to make 
gunpowder and a crude cannon. 

IV 

T he first trading was with a 
small tribe — two families to- 
taling fourteen individuals — that 
lived in caves in the side of a ra- 
vine. The caves were actually the 
mines. From those mines came red 
iron ore that the tiny tribe smelted, 
using charcoal as the reducing 
agent, in an intriguing crude oven 
built of quartz crystals. The prod- 
uct was ingots of gray steel, 
pitted and grainy. The tribe had a 
well that produced insufficient 
water and they sold Pendergast 
twenty-four ingots for two six-gal- 
lon skins of water. 

What a contrast the metal was, 
Kreg mused, to the stock of stain- 
less steel and other alloys stored in 
Nose Cone! 

The next two tribes were hardly 
different from the first. A night’s 
trek beyond the third tribe, though, 
brought the expedition to a larger 
one — close to fifty individuals — 
that had, besides iron, a bronze 
alloy and some copper and lead. 
All but a little of the trading wa- 



150 



IF 




ter went there. Now Kreg had to 
carry ingots in his backpack. 

They started on westward at sun- 
down. At the first stop Kreg swal- 
lowed his mouthful of water and 
lay down on his back. Main Hull 
was just beginning to dim as it en- 
tered shadow. 

Pendergast sat down beside him. 
“Here we are, trekking for days to 
buy a few pounds of metal, while 
all that high-grade steel hangs up 
there in the sky! I wonder if it’ll all 
burn up when it falls. If not, I 
suppose the colony’s descendants 
will grab what’s left.” 

Kreg glanced at the bearded 
man. “You mean, you don’t think 
your own descendants will have a 
chance at it?” 

“Do you?” 

Kreg, uncomfortable, knew this 
conversation was deliberate. “I 
suppose not, now that I think 
about it.” 

Pendergast chuckled. “You said 
your descendants, though. Don’t 
you expect to have any? Or don’t 
you think of yourself as an exile 
yet?” 

Kreg’s face grew warm. “I guess 
I’ve never thought about having 
descendants. When they sent me 
out ...” 

The trek leader said, “There’s a 
fairly even balance of men and 
women among us and you don’t 
look like a potential bachelor to 
me. I have two sons and a daugh- 
ter. I think a lot about them and 
about the children they’ll have. 



Some day the Brains will finish this 
weeding out they preach, and let 
the colony expand. I wonder about 
what’ll happen to my descendants 
then. I think they’ll simply be 
pushed aside.” 

Kreg, not liking the subject, 
didn’t answer, and the older man 
let it rest there. 

T he next trading site was in a 
shallow ravine that had almost 
no kitchgrass and few quilltrees. 
The mine holes were there, but the 
tribe was missing. 

The expedition, after studying 
footprints that led downravine, set 
up the sun fence and stopped to 
discuss things. Nujent came back 
from looking at the local well. 
“Low, but not completely dry, so 
that wasn’t why they left. Damn 
it — another metal-source gone! 
Why don’t we organize some am- 
bushes and capture a grav car or 
two? We could fly them until the 
power gave out, then break them 
up for metal.” 

Kreg saw Pendergast’s sharp 
look at Nujent and didn’t miss the 
ensuing exaggerated silence — or 
Nujent’s furtive look at Kreg. He 
felt his face grow warm. What was 
going on? Did they — could they — 
suspect he was a spy? Ridiculous! 
Why would the Brains want spies 
among the exiles? 

Nujent was saying, “If they’d 
intended to be back they’d have left 
a message. I’m for taking what 
metal’s around.” 



HOT WORLD 



151 




Pendergast said, “We could do 
that. Still, there is a chance they 
ntight come back — or some of 
them might. We’ve got water we 
don’t need for getting home. I 
think we ought to put it in what air- 
tight containers we have and cache 
it here. That way they’re paid for 
the metal, whatever happens. And 
if they don’t come back the cache 
of water will keep. We might find 
it handy on the next expedition.’’ 

Nujent shrugged. “Just so we get 
the metal.’’ 

Four nights downravine they 
found the first graves. 

The missing tribe left no mys- 
tery here. A note, scrawled in char- 
coal upon a piece of leather hung 
on a cross, read, “Epidemic. No 
medicine. We’re trying for the 
lake, but had to stop here two days, 
and nine out of seventeen died. 
Four others sick, but able to go 
on.’’ The signature was, “Stan 
Peters, Mayor.’’ 

Two of the nine graves were chil- 
dren’s. 

P ENDERGAST hung the note 
back on the grave. “If we’d on- 
ly been a few days earlier the anti- 
biotics would have — ’’ 

Kreg asked hesitantly, “What 
kind of disease do you suppose it 
was?’’ 

The trek leader gestured vague- 
ly. “There are several that hit peo- 
ple in the desert. One’s something 
like very bad measles. Another’s 
like diphtheria. The standard an- 



tibiotic is effective against all of 
them.’’ 

Nujent muttered, “If you have 
any of it.’’ 

Pendergast glanced at the sky. 
“Two hours till morning. I’m for 
trekking straight through until we 
catch them.’’ 

No one demurred. They hurried 
on, alternating between a shuffling 
trot—the best pace they could 
manage, laden as they were — and 
a slow walk to catch breath. Sweat 
covered Kreg; and he was desert- 
minded enough now to be disturbed 
about it. He stubbornly resisted 
the yearning to drink and after a 
while he stopped sweating. Now he 
felt like a dry leaf. He stared in 
vague horror at his hands — the 
very flesh seemed to have shrunk. 
The pulse in his muggy head was 
hot and noisy and his limbs 
trembled with weakness. 

Some time after noon they 
rounded a bend and found the 
eight survivors sprawled in what 
shade was available. 

Stan Peters was one of the four 
sick and in no condition to talk. 
Except for the slow rise and fall of 
his chest and an occasional twitch 
he seemed dead, but a few drops of 
water on his swollen, parched 
tongue brought a moan and a stir. 

Kreg helped erect the sun fence 
and drag the victims into its shade. 
Pendergast went among them with 
a waterbag. Kreg noted that not 
one of them — even the youngest 
child — gulped. As badly off as they 



152 



IF 




were, they had the self-control to 
sip meagerly. 

When all had been revived 
enough to swallow antibiotic tab- 
lets from Kreg’s belt a brief council 
was held. The decision was that 
Nujent and four others would stay 
behind to help the survivors along 
when they were able to travel, 
while Pendergast and the bulk of 
the expedition went on ahead. 

They started at sundown. Three 
nights’ travel took them to Lake 
Salvation. 

K REG hadn’t known there was 
any such growth of vegetation 
in Hidry Desert. 

The entire shallow bowl was per- 
haps fifteen miles across, the lake 
occupying the hub. The entire land 
area was wooded. Quilltrees grew 
on the slopes, while the flat bot- 
tom was choked with tall straight 
round-leaved trees resembling 
Terran poplars. Kitchgrass formed 
a lush carpet; insects and kinches 
swarmed above it. There were 
small rabbitlike quadrupeds — 
not furry but scaled— and once 
Kreg saw, darting between the 
trees, a dozen predators more or 
less feline in shape and about as 
big as a lynx. They, too, were fur- 
less. 

There were no birds, but he saw 
winged reptiles bigger than the 
kinches, and gliding quadrupeds. 

The only edible fruit — to which 
Pendergast introduced him on the 
way — were tiny round things that 



grew in clusters. They tasted like 
peaches except for an alumlike 
quality that made Kreg’s mouth 
pucker. The trek leader grinned. 

“They’re moist at least. Terran 
transplants would grow here if the 
colony would part with any. 
There’s a good layer of soil, moist 
enough a few feet down. It’s not 
salty — there must be enough 
underground drainage to prevent 
that. We could support a fair-sized 
population here.” 

Kreg stared along the trail they 
were following. “Is your — I mean 
our — tribe the only one here?” 

Pendergast shook his head. 
“We’re the biggest, but there are 
four others scattered around the 
lake. Plus some roving bands that 
summer here. We have our own 
sector, which includes the ravine 
where we met you. Others claim 
other ravines. A ravine, especially 
one with ground water, is a sort of 
highway. A tribe naturally trades 
with an area that can be reached 
from its own ravine. Practically the 
whole population of Hidry Desert 
lives within a hundred miles of the 
lake.” 

Kreg looked southward, but the 
far rim of the basin hid the coun- 
try beyond. “It can’t be more than 
five hundred miles in that direc- 
tion to South Sea.” 

“No,” Pendergast agreed, “and 
it’s only a hundred and eighty to 
Salterra Escarpment. You could 
travel that far in the rainy season 
— if you call six or seven inches of 



HOT WORLD 



153 




rain rainy. Below that the land is 
one salt flat, an old seabed, and 
there's practically no rain from 
South Sea.” 

Kreg said, “But there are other 
continents. And some day when the 
colony expands — ” 

The bearded exile smiled. “Some 
day, yes — if there are still fission- 
ables in Nose Cone and if the ma- 
chinery is still working. But long 
before then our descendants will 
have been — as I said before — 
shoved aside.” 

V 

K reg was surprised at the way 
the tribe lived. 

There were no shelters except 
sun shades. A family site consisted 
of sleeping pads in some tree 
clump, ;some pegs in tree trunks to 
hang things on and perhaps a hang- 
ing shelf to keep things away from 
children or small animals. Posses- 
sions included a few garments for 
warding off sun, some cooking 
utensils and a rack of weapons — 
spears, bows, knives. And, of 
course, waterbags. 

The whole settlement was strung 
along a small tongue of lake jut- 
ting into the ravine. 

The food had little variety. Fish 
or other meat was a staple. Bread 
was made from dried and pulver- 
ized quilltree roots. The single 
fruit provided a beverage — the 
juice, boiled with a certain bark 
then settled, lost its astringency. 



It could be fermented and usually 
was. 

There were children of all ages 
and adults. Kreg found himself og- 
ling the wrong girls and drawing 
haughty looks from them and men- 
acing scowls from young men, un- 
til he learned what kind of hair- 
braids meant marriage or engage- 
ment. 

The work was necessarily hard. 
Kreg, assigned to a camp of young 
bachelors, went on hunts. Fished for 
solelike creatures in the lake, dug 
roots, carried waterbags, and the 
like. There was vague talk of his 
learning some such trade as metal- 
working, but for now his young 
strong back was sufficient. 

Nujent had arrived several days 
behind him, shepherding all but 
one of the rescued group. The one 
had died along the way. Stan Pet- 
ers and the other sick were recov- 
ering. 

Excited by their arrival, Pen- 
dergast had gone into hurried 
council with Peters and Nujent; 
then Pendergast and Nujent had 
left, taking with them some small 
leather-wrapped bundles. They 
had returned a day later without 
the bundles and without explana- 
tion. Kreg, who had found occa- 
sion to talk to Pendergast after- 
ward, had discovered the lean, 
bearded man oddly distracted. He 
hadn't asked questions. 

Forty or fifty days went by. Kreg 
was accepted now — no one treated 
him like an outsider. He began to

IF 




spend what free time he had at the 
tribe's forge, where the acquired 
metal and some worn-out cooking 
utensils were being fashioned into 
new things. His old life in the 
colony seemed distant. 

O NE day six gravcars appeared 
over the lake. 

Kreg happened to be fishing and 
saw them at once. His midriff 
went taut. These were four-place 
lawkeep cars and, though he could 
see no weapons, he presumed the 
cars to be armed. What did they 
want? 

The sun glinted on something — 
cameras. He stayed where he was, 
watching, while the cars slowly 
circled the lake. Why this survey? 
The colony already had pictures 
of the lake. 

Then the small flotilla came 
directly toward him. He looked 
around nervously, saw no one else 
in sight and rejected an urge to 
run. One of the cars dropped to 
hover a few yards out and the can- 
opy slid back. Now he could see 
rifle barrels. The lawkeeps stared 
at him as if he were an alien. Final- 
ly one spoke. “How many exiles 
live around this lake?” 

Kreg hesitated. “I don’t know. 
I’ve only been here a little while.” 
The lawkeep scowled. “Is that 
so? How many tribes are there?” 
“Four, I guess.” 

“Where do you live, if you don’t 
live here?” 

Kreg felt himself flush. “I live 



here now. I was just exiled the mid- 
dle of spring.” 

The four occupants of the car 
looked surprised. Then the spokes- 
man grinned. “Well, how n^any 
people would you guess live here?” 
Kreg wondered what to say. “A 
couple hundred — maybe a few 
more. I haven’t seen many.” 

The spokesman said something 
to the others, then made a gesture. 
Kreg could see him using a hand- 
microphone. The canopy slid shut 
and the car rose. The six cars took 
up a formation radial to the lake 
and began a circle over the sur- 
rounding woods. Kreg picked up 
what fish he had and hurried to- 
ward Pendergast’s living site. 

The bearded ex was standing in a 
small clear area, chest moving as if 
he’d just been running, staring 
after the gravcars. His family 
peered nervously from cover. Pen- 
dergast turned quickly to Kreg. 
“Did you see them?” 

“I sure did. They flew around 
the lake taking pictures, then 
came down and asked me ques- 
tions.” 

“How many were there? What 
kind of cars? What did they want?” 
“They want to know how many 
people live here.” 

The bearded man grunted. 
“What did you tell them?” 

“I said I was new and that I 
guessed two hundred.” 

Pendergast grinned. “That was 
all right. But what do you guess 
they are doing now?”

saw cameras aimed straight 
down — and some other instru- 
ments. I’d say they’re running a 
photo-map of the basin. Also — 
well, the cars carry infrared de- 
tectors, that can find a person 
through foliage. They could be 
trying to get a count on us.” 

Pendergast sighed. ”1 imagine 
that’s it. I’m going to where I can 
keep an eye on them. Will you find 
Nujent and Peters? Tell them I 
want to see them up near the rim.” 

K REG didn’t see Pendergast 
again until the next day. 
“Tomsun, we want you to at- 
tend a council. Don’t mention it to 
anybody.” 

Kreg waited while Pendergast 
rounded up some family heads who 
served as elders of the tribe. The 
small group walked up the ravine 
almost to the rim of the basin, then 
turned off along a game trail. Pres- 
ently they joined other men in a 
quilltree thicket. Nujent and 
Peters were there. 

Pendergast opened the talk. 
“This is secret. We’re worried 
about the colony’s intentions. This 
is the first time they’ve ever tried to 
take a head count or survey the 
basin.” He sat brooding for a 
moment, then looked at Kreg. 
“Tomsun, we’re as sure now as 
we’ll ever be that you’re not a spy. 
Anyway, we’re taking the risk be- 
cause we need you. For some time 
we’ve had a vague plan to raid the 
colony for weapons and things. 



What we’ve been waiting for is 
someone familiar enough with 
Nose Cone and the area around it 
to fill in certain details for 
us — and to do certain things in- 
side. Events seem to be pushing us 
right now. Are you willing to take 
part?” 

Kreg stared at the man. “Raid 
the colony? You can’t be serious. 
How would you even get close to it, 
let alone through the fence?” 

Pendergast told him, “We’d 
have teams going north ahead of 
time to bury caches of water and 
food. And we think we can sneak 
in.” 

“But the lawkeeps — ” 

Nujent put in tensely. “That’s 
one thing we who were born here 
don’t know about. Would lawkeeps 
have guts enough to fight? And 
how about repair robots? Could 
they use guns?” 

Kreg felt bewildered. “Uh — the 
’pairbots couldn’t aim guns with 
much accuracy. The lawkeeps 
would fight — don’t get the idea 
that all the courage has been weed- 
ed out of the colony. They’d be 
under direct orders of the Brains, 
anyway.” 

Pendergast said impatiently, 
“Nujent, we’re not going to try to 
storm in. Tomsun, what do you 
think — if we got into Nose Cone 
disguised as citizens and seized 
control, could we raid the arsenal 
and get enough weapons? And 
what else would we be up against?” 

Kreg stared dazedly at the taut 



156 



IF 




faces. “You’ve seen Nose Cone, 
Pendergast. It was built to with- 
stand centuries in space — if nec- 
essary. It’s a virtual fortress. Once 
you got inside, if the access doors 
were closed you’d be trapped.’’ 

The bearded exile grinned. “We 
are planning on that. Tell me— 
would a heavy pistol bullet pene- 
trate those cabinets the Brains are 
in?’’ 

Kreg gasped. After a moment he 
said hoarsely, “I — I’m sure it 
would. But — ’’ 

P EN DERG AST leaned toward 
him tensely. “You know the 
power lines and the control 
boards, don’t you? You were an ap- 
prentice.’’ 

“I know as much as attendants 
are taught.’’ 

Pendergast said fiercely, “Well, 
will you go along with us? Or 
would you rather wait until they 
come down here and drive us away 
from the lake?’’ 

Kreg tried to avoid the burning 
eyes. He found he had trouble 
breathing. “I — okay. I’m not 
grateful for being exiled. But I 
think your plan is insane!’’ 

Pendergast relaxed a little. 
“Maybe you’ll think differently 
when you’ve heard the whole 
scheme.’’ He turned to Nujent, 
who handed him the four leather- 
wrapped bundles Kreg 'has seen 
before. Pendergast began unwrap- 
ping one. “Stan Peters and his 
tribe dug these out of a mine. 



They’ve been buried for thousands 
of years — maybe hundreds of 
thousands.’’ He pulled away the 
last wrapping and held up an 
object. 

Kreg’s skin prickled. The arti- 
fact was not man-made — it was too 
corroded, too caked with sand ag- 
gregate. It must have been on New 
Eden a long time, as Pendergast 
said. It had been, Kreg guessed, 
some kind of communicator — 
something like the compact two- 
way radios gravcars had. There 
was one badly distorted coil of 
wire in a few heavy turns; other 
shapes that might be multiple- 
turn coils. Kreg recognized the 
remains of a variable condenser 
and things that might be tubes and 
transistors. 

Pendergast unwrapped another 
bundle. Kreg could make nothing 
of the artifact. Pendergast said, 
“This was a device for condensing 
moisture from the air. Not much 
use here, if the climate was always 
as dry as it is now — but better 
than nothing. The point is — some 
race landed here. They may have 
colonized or they may not. 
Possibly whole cities will be dug up 
some day — old spaceships, maybe. 
Here’s how these artifacts tie in 
with our plan: by having these 
things found away from Nose 
Cone, we can divert enough atten- 
tion from the fence to let us slip 
in.’’ 

Nujent was impatiently offering 
the other two small bundles. Pen-

dergast grinned, took them and un- 
wrapped one. 

Kreg gasped with the rest. There 
was no ne^ to guess what these 
were! They hadn't been shaped for 
human hands — rather, perhaps for 
tentacles or some kind of 
claws — but they were pistols. The 
handles were nearly cylindrical, 
coarsely knurled, and set at an ob- 
tuse angle to the barrels. But they 
were pistols. There was no caked 
sand on them — obviously they'd 
recently been cleaned up with 
great care. 

Pendergast said, “We've been 
secretly hoarding five pistols for 
years. These two more give us the 
seven minimum for our plan." 

Kreg heard his own awed voice. 
“Will they shoot? Is there ammu- 
nition?" 

Pendergast grinned. “Yes to 
both questions." 

VI 

P reparations took many 

days. Spring sweltered into 
summer. Waterholes away from 
the lake showed new rims of dirt 
pawed out by hellrunners. What 
little green the quilltrees had, 
bleached out to an ivory white and 
the quills began to curl with dry- 
ness. 

Gravcars flew high over the 
basin twice. Kreg lived in half 
dread, half eagerness for the thing 
he'd agreed to do. 

At last the time came and he 



started upravine with Pendergast, 
Nujent, Peters and two dozen 
others. The trip was long and hard, 
but the day came when he lay 
sweltering under camouflage, 
peering out at an irregular hori- 
zon. He had never seen Desolation 
Ridge from this side before. The 
south slope was surprisingly short. 

When night came Pendergast's 
men would climb it and look down 
the much longer slope to South 
Fence. Before morning they 
would either have gotten what 
they wanted from the colony or be 
dead. 

Nujent and three others had left 
them last night, angling east, 
taking the alien communicator and 
the moisture-collector. Now that 
the time was near, the whole idea 
seemed idiotic to Kreg. How much 
diversion would Nujent create at 
most? A few gravcars and law- 
keeps, a theoretician or two. And 
certainly little time would be lost 
bringing the artifacts to the colony 
— probably to Research Center, 
six blocks from Nose Cone. 

Still, he supposed it was better 
than nothing. 

He squirmed, seeking a more 
comfortable position. 

F rom atop Desolation Ridge 
he stared down at the distant 
lights. He could locate Nose Cone 
by the dogleg of the fence, but 
couldn't make out the huge bullet 
shape. Inside, the lights of Land- 
ington stretched northward; and 



158 



IF 




beyond, distant glows marked a 
few farm-centers. He could trace 
the course of Thirsty River from its 
eastern entry at the Sunrise Hills 
and along its irregular curve 
through the colony. North Fence, 
of course, was out of sight, thirty 
miles away. 

Pendergast hissed at him. “Nu- 
jent must be on station. Let’s start 
down!” 

Kreg rose to his feet, made sure 
the small bundle of civilized cloth- 
ing was secure around his waist, 
and led off. Though he had seen 
this slope a thousand times, noth- 
ing about it seemed familiar now. 
He felt like a fly crawling down a 
well-lit wall. He told himself the 
sentries wouldn’t be able to see 
him by mere starlight. He stum- 
bled in a dry rill, caught himself 
and went more carefully. The rest 
of the party was spaced out be- 
hind him. 

Pendergast whispered, see 
Nose Cone. As I remember, that 
warehouse was about two hun- 
dred yards west.” 

Kreg said, “A little farther than 
that. See the next fence light west 
of Nose Cone? Count four more. 
That’s the warehouse.” 

“Right,” Pendergast said. 
“Where’s the gully?” 

Kreg kneaded his memory. 
“About twenty yards past the 
warehouse. That puts it close to a 
light.” He could see a sentry pac- 
ing. “Here’s the beginning of the 
gully. We’d better crawl.” 



The gulch bottom was gravelly 
under his hands. Wings buzzed, 
barely above the threshold of audi- 
bility as startled kinches fled. He 
could feel the greater moisture of 
this air. 

The sentry reached the end of his 
beat, peered around and started 
back. How dark did this slope look 
to him? 

Kreg, tense to weakness, crawled 
on. The gully deepened, and he be- 
gan to believe he might actually 
reach the fence. He believed, too, 
that, as Pendergast maintained, 
there would be a grill and culvert 
to let water in under the fence. But 
wouldn’t it be a strong grill, per- 
manently mounted? Strange. 
He had scampered along inside 
that fence, at that exact spot, in 
children’s games and later paced 
sentry duty — and never wondered 
what happened to the water that 
came sparsely down the gully in 
winter. Surely it wasn’t wasted. In 
the colony a buried conduit sys- 
tem collected even drain-off from 
roofs. 

He threw a glance at the sentry 
— going away now — and crawled 
fast. He reached the end of the 
gully, just at the fence, twisted his 
head and saw his companions 
flattening themselves. 

He paused. 

Pendergast crawled up beside 
him. “I told you so! The grill’s 
hinged— and padlocked!” The 
bearded man grinned and bran- 
dished a small crowbar. 



HOT WORLD 



159 




T he culvert was tight enough to 
impede crawling. Kreg had to 
keep his elbows at his sides and 
squirm forward. His heart still 
pounded from the noise the break- 
ing padlock had made. He could 
hear the men behind him grunting 
with effort and gasping for 
breath. The culvert smelled dusty. 
His hands were raw. He must, he 
thought, be far inside the 
fence — past the big warehouse. 
How much farther did the culvert 
go without a turn or intersec- 
tion? Would a welded grill stop 
Pendergast? 

He wondered how Nujent was 
doing. Suppose the Brains, suspi- 
cious, had Nugent and his com- 
panions interrogated under drugs? 

He suddenly became aware of a 
faint, diffuse glow ahead. Sheer 
primitive dread of this black pipe 
made him wriggle ahead like a 
desperate caterpillar. He got close 
enough to look up a vertical shaft 
and see, through an ample grill, 
bright stars. He went limp, lungs 
gasping in breath. Pendergast’s 
head bumped into his feet. 

Would the manhole above be 
fastened? He squirmed onto his 
back, bent his body into the outlet, 
felt about and encountered welded 
handholds. He went up until he 
could push at the grill. It was 
heavy, but it lifted. He hesitated, 
decided there was nothing to lose 
and carefully pushed the grill free, 
sliding it aside. The surface out- 
side sounded and felt like gravel. 



Cautiously, he thrust his head out. 
They were in a yard of some kind. 
He recognized dim shapes as grav- 
cars and parts of gravcars. From 
somewhere beyond a dark wall 
came muffled voices. He climbed 
out. 

Pendergast was quickly beside 
him. “Where are we?” 

“In the back yard of a garage 
and hangar where Nose Cone’s of- 
ficial gravcars are serviced. I’ve 
never been here before, but that 
gate opens onto a side street.” 
Evidently no word of the alien, 
artifacts had gotten out to the cit- 
izenry yet. The few people on the 
streets strolled casually. He 
glanced up at the stars. Nearly 
midnight, he thought. A shift 
would let out then and the streets 
would fill. A certain number of 
citizens would converge on Nose 
Cone to idle through the museum 
displays before going home. That 
might help or hinder. 

He smoothed his clothes and 
walked slowly toward the plaza, 
trying to avert his face when he 
met anybody. He had to give 
Pendergast and a few others time 
to get ahead of him. 

B y the time he reached the 
plaza, he knew there was some 
excitement. People began moving 
faster and he caught snatches of 
excited talk. A gravcar rose from 
the hangar behind him and moved 
eastward along the fence. An- 
other followed. 



160 



IF 




He paused at the edge of the 
plaza. He did not dare wait any 
longer. He strode toward Access 
Three, recognized the attendant 
there, went past with averted face 
and approached Access Four. 
The man on duty was a stranger. 
Kreg, trying to keep his face calm, 
nodded to him and walked in. 

Perhaps four dozen people were 
in the Rotunda. Some were 
gathering in a knot. He heard an 
excited voice say, “Just fell 
down!” That would be one of his 
own companions, drawing atten- 
tion. Kreg hurried around the 
periphery toward a door marked 
PERSONNEL ONLY. It burst 
open and four attendants ran out 
— two of them familiar. He shrank 
against the wall. When they were 
past he pushed open the door and 
went through. The down-ramp was 
empty — but when he reached the 
next deck down he met a ’pair- 
bot. The thing’s wheels swiveled to- 
ward him and the machine said 
tonelessly, “Visitors not per- 
mitted here, sir.” 

Kreg fought down panic. He 
gave his old apprentice’s number 
and said hastily, “A citizen has 
fainted in the Rotunda. They’ll be 
bringing him to our infirmary!” 

The machine was silent for a mo- 
ment — doubtless consulting a 
Brain— then it rolled out of his 
way. He hurried past, praying it 
hadn’t flashed a picture of his face 
to the Brain. But no one came to 
intercept him. He passed doors 



marked JANITORIAL DEPOS- 
ITORY, LECTURE MACHIN- 
ERY, PERSONNEL INFIRM- 
ARY. He glanced back along the 
curved corridor. It was empty. 

He paused before the door 
marked ROTUNDA CON- 
TROLS, took a deep breath and 
pushed it open. ^ 

No one was on duty — the 
standby attendant must be one of 
the four he’d met. He walked 
across the compartment, des- 
perately willing his face to hide the 
tumult inside him. He sat down in 
the duty chair before the control 
console. If the autoviewers’ pic- 
ture of him didn’t get the notice of 
a Brain for a few seconds ... He 
picked up a voice reel that lay as if 
the attendant had been listening 
to it and pressed the stud. The nar- 
rator’s voice said, “Once safely out 
of the burning forest, Jules Gray- 
son ran toward Highway Forty- 
seven — ” 

Kreg’s left hand stole toward a 
switch and flipped it. 

The room went dark; Instantly 
he was out of the chair. For the 
benefit of the audio-monitors, he 
exclaimed, “Whaf the — ” Then he 
was at the trapdoor in one corner 
of the room. He bent and heaved it 
open; he almost jumped into the 
opening and put his feet on familiar 
rungs. Blue emergency lights had 
already flashed on. His feet 
touched a deck. Scanners would 
see him now, even in the dim 
standby light here. He leaped for a 



HOT WORLD 



161 




control board — Nose Cone’s main 
one — and grabbed for a master 
switch. It seemed to him he float- 
ed in slow motion. Why didn’t the 
bullets come? 

But his fingers closed on the 
switch handle and jerked it down. 

VII 

T he standby lights went out— 
but blue emergency lights 
flashed on, as they would do 
throughout Nose Cone. He heard 
relays slam home as the main pow- 
er cut off. Now the general 
intercom was on and he could hear 
citizens screaming in the Rotunda, 
hear attendants shouting in 
various parts of the giant structure. 
One attendant called out, “Be 
calm! Please be orderly and stand 
where you are. Lights will be 
restored in a very few minutes.” 
Kreg jerked open panels, seized 
wires and tugged at them. They cut 
into his fingers, but some pulled 
loose — enough, he knew. He 
slammed the panels and ran for the 
ladder. He went up it like a squir- 
rel, bunched himself and shoved 
the trapdoor open. 

The corridor door was opening. 
Kreg leaped toward it, stopped a 
startled attendant with a stiff left, 
swung his right hard for the jaw. 
The man slumped to the floor. 
Kreg hesitated. Should he dam- 
age wiring here, too? No— let 
them guess for a while, if the 
Brains couldn’t talk to them! He 



stepped over the unconscious 
man and turned left along the cor- 
ridor. A few ’pairbots and atten- 
dants milled aimlessly. He shoved 
past them and ran for a ramp a 
fourth of the way around Nose 
Cone. 

A babble of talk came from the 
intercom, some of it hysterical, 
but not a word from the Brains. 
Had he guessed wrong? Did they 
not, after all, have their own secret 
emergency communication net- 
work? Maybe they were just being 
cool — assessing information be- 
fore they acted. 

He dashed up the incline and 
along the higher corridor. Citizen’s 
feet blundered about in the Rotun- 
da over his head. He reached the 
compartment that belonged to 
Captain Gerlik’s Brain; he hesi- 
tated from habit, then plunged in. 

A man stood facing the Brain 
cabinet. In the dim blue light Kreg 
did not at once recognize Pehder- 
gast. The bearded exile flashed him 
a glance, then fixed his eyes on the 
cabinet again. The alien pistol in 
his hand aimed steadily where 
Kreg knew the Brain to be. 

There was shaky triumph in Pen- 
dergast’s voice. “Looks as if you 
did it, Tomsun. I half expected to 
be filled full of bullets the instant I 
stepped in here. But there hasn’t 
been a sound.” 

Kreg suddenly realized the com- 
partment’s intercom was silent — 
the muffled commotion he heard 
was coming through decks and 



162

bulkheads. “What happened in the 
Rotunda? Why didn’t everyone 
runout?” 

Pendergast chuckled. “Because 
the access doors slammed shut too 
quickly. You were right about 
that.” 

A nd now, suddenly — making 
^ Kreg jump — Gerlik’s voice 
came from the cabinet. “Of course. 
You didn’t expect we’d be unpre- 
pared, did you? How did you get 
back inside the colony?” 

Pendergast snarled, “That’s our 
secret.” 

Gerlik’s voice said, “I recognize 
you now — Martin Pendergast. 
You’ve lasted a long time in the 
desert.” 

Pendergast said harshly, “We 
don’t want idle talk. In case you’re 
not in contact with the other 
Brains, every one of them has a 
pistol pointed at it. You see the one 
pointed at you, don’t you?” 

/‘Yes, I see it. And I see the 
others. Naturally we’re in contact. 
Some of the weapons look quite 
rusty — and two of them look odd. 
Are you sure they’ll shoot?” 

Pendergast said amusedly, “You 
don’t think we failed to test them, 
do you? And the bullets will pene- 
trate that thin steel in front of 
you.” 

Gerlik sighed, “No doubt. But 
what good would that do you? You 
can’t control Nose Cone. You can’t 
even get out — the doors won’t open 
unless we open them.” 



Kreg said nervously, “Don’t let 
him stall!” 

Pendergast said, “In that case. 
Captain, we simply won’t get out. 
This is the way it’ll be: we have 
certain demands. If you don’t meet 
them — fast — we’ll put a bullet 
through each of you, and worry 
later about the doors.” 

Gerlik chuckled. “How heroic! 
What are. these demands you’re 
willing to die for?” 

Pendergast’s voice shook. “We 
want weapons. “We’ll leave you 
enough to keep civil order in the 
colony, but we want the heavy stuff 
so we’ll never have to worry about 
your intentions. We want metal, 
tools and medicines. And a few 
chemicals so we can exploit the 
land you’ve dumped us onto. You 
can keep this strip north of Deso- 
lation Ridge, including Sunrise 
Hills.” 

The Brain didn’t answer at once. 
Then Gerlik said ironically, “Is 
that all? Why don’t you demand 
Nose Cone? In fact, why don’t you 
just set yourselves up as a ruling 
class?” 

Pendergast grunted scornfully. 
“We don’t want the kind of people 
you want. We don’t even want the 
gravcars, except a few for explor- 
ation and emergencies. They won’t 
last forever anyway — and neither 
will ‘your fissionables. You can go 
your way and we’ll go ours. Unless 
you bother us we won’t even be 
talking to you!” 

Another pause, then Gerlik said 



HOT WORLD 



163 




stonily, “We’d be fools to take 
your word for that, even if we had 
to. Fortunately, we don’t. Now, 
we’re not going to waste time talk- 
ing. You’re locked in. When you 
get ready to surrender, we’ll give 
you enough food and water to get 
back to Lake Salvation. And the 
next time you come north you’ll be 
killed on sight.’’ 

P ENDERGAST stood silent for 
a moment, then shot Kreg a 
glance. Kreg shrugged indecisively. 
The bearded man took a step near- 
er the cabinet. “I’ll give you thirty 
seconds by my estimate. If you 
haven't agreed to our demands by 
then. I’ll put a bullet through you 
and dicker with the other Brains. 
We’ll kill you all, one at a time, if 
we have to!’’ 

Tho^noise from the Rotunda was 
less now. Pendergast’s men must 
be in control there. Seconds 
dragged by. Kreg could see Pen- 
dergast’s lips moving in the count. 
Finally the bearded man snapped, 
“Five seconds!’’ Kreg’s insides 
kneaded. Would the exile leader 
shoot? Would he himself — hav- 
ing made the promise? It would be 
murder — murder! 

The jgun went off deafeningly. 
The front of the cabinet distorted 
violently and showed a jagged hole. 
A little viscous liquid oozed out. 
Pendergast whirled savagely to 
Kreg. “Which one shall we take 
next?’’ 

Kreg felt sick. His voice was 



hoarse. “Let’s talk to Uncle Ben! 
He may be more reasonable!’’ He 
turned blindly to the door and 
stumbled along the corridor. 

The exile aiming a gun at Ben 
Tomsun’s cabinet jerked it around 
toward them as they entered, then 
quickly recovered. Uncle Ben’s 
voice said sadly, “So you’ve killed 
Captain Gerlik.’’ 

Pendergast said woodenly, 
“Right. We don’t care who’s 
next!’’ 

Uncle Ben sighed. “Violence! 
Violence! Don’t you realize you 
carry self-destruction in your 
genes? You demand weapons. How 
long do you think it will be before 
you turn them on each other?’’ 
Pendergast laughed shortly. 
“That’s no problem of yours. Give 
us the guns, if you think we’ll kill 
each other. That’ll put you back in 
control!’’ 

The voice said, “Why? Why is all 
this necessary? Why can’t you live 
out your lives peacefully? We could 
have destroyed you instead of 
exiling you. Are you trying to 
prove that we should have?” 

The lean, bearded exile said, 
“That’s a matter of viewpoint. We 
intend to live our lives as well as we 
can and provide better ones for our 
descendants. You’ve talked 
enough. I’ll give you the same 
thirty seconds I gave Gerlik.’’ 

Uncle Ben said hastily, “We’ll 
yield. The colony comes first with 
us — you know that. We must 
survive to guide it. How many of 



164 



IF 




you are there inside Nose Cone?” 
“That’s classified information.” 

B en said in a hurt tone, “I’m 
only wondering about the logis- 
tics. Some of you will have to carry 
weapons from the arsenal. You 
may take your pick — we’ll assign 
’pairbots to help you, if you wish. 
Can you all get away in six 
gravcars? We want to avoid any 
more killing. First of all we’d bet- 
ter clear the plaza.” Intercom 
loudspeakers suddenly came to 
life in Uncle Ben’s voice, “All citi- 
zens and lawkeeps — move away 
from Nose Cone. Several armed 
men in citizen’s clothes will be 
coming out. No one is. to interfere 
with them in any way. They may 
take what gravcars they choose. 
This is important! Everyone 
must obey.” To the three exiles in 
his compartment, Ben said in a 
weary voice, “It will be best if you 
stay here for a few minutes, until 
the plaza is cleared. Then I’ll talk 
to the people in the Rotunda.” 
Pendergast turned a taut face to 
Kreg, who said nothing. He felt as 
if he’d swallowed lead. Could 
things possibly go so smoothly? 

The Rotunda sounded quiet, but 
from somewhere came faint shouts. 
Outside? Could he hear sounds 
from the plaza, with the access 
doors all shut? Probably — there 
were still the ventilator openings. 

Or were there? He realized he 
couldn’t hear the familiar hum of 
fans. Nose Cone was. quieter than 



he’d ever heard it. Maybe that was 
what made him feel drowsy. 

Then, in the silence, he became 
aware of a faint hiss. “Gas!” he 
yelled, breaking toward the door. 
Already his muscles were slow. He 
stumbled, caught his balance, 
shoved the door open. Behind him, 
the^alien pistol went off. Ears 
ringing, he ran up the corridor, 
shouting, “Gas! Gas!” More pistol 
shots made the bulkheads rattle. 
Exiles staggered from the Brain 
compartments. He could hear 
them gasping. He struggled 
toward the nearest up-ramp, forced 
his wobbly legs to climb it and 
pushed the door. A companion’! 
lurched into him from behind. He 
stared at unconscious citizens on 
the Rotunda floor. 

Then he heard the rumble of 
access doors sliding open. “This 
way — ” he blurted. 

VIII 

T he outside air gradually 
cleared his mind. He lurched 
across the plaza, seeing citizens run 
away from him. He paused to gulp 
deep breaths, then ran down a 
street, crossed an intersection, and 
leaned for a moment against the 
corner of the gravcar hangar. 
Pendergast staggered to him. “Are 
— are there likely to be weapons 
here?” 

The anesthetic was washing out 
of Kreg. He took two steps and 
peered into the hangar. “I think so. 



HOT WORLD 



165 




In that four-place lawkeep car. 
And that one.” 

Other exiles were joining them 
now. Kreg hurried into the hangar, 
darted looks around and saw no- 
body. He hauled himself into one 
of the cars and felt beside the seats 
for weapons. He found standard 
bullet-rifles and hyprodermic 
guns. He swiftly looked in com- 
partments for extra ammunition 
and found it, then turned on the 
power. Men w«re piling in behind 
him, Pendergast ran to the second 
car he’d been shown. It filled, too. 
The overflow had to seek out two- 
place cars ready to fly. Kreg moved 
his car forward into the open, then 
lifted it a hundred feet_and shot 
across the fence. He stopped so the 
others could pull level. Pender- 
gast called out, ”1 want to send 
someone after medicines. Is the 
public infirmary where it always 
was?” 

Kreg nodded. “Eight blocks 
north of Nose Cone!” 

Pendergast said, “Do you want 
to take care of that? I’ll go try to 
pick up Nujent!” 

Kreg nodded and swung the car 
around. He shot north above the 
crowded streets. He could hear 
people shouting questions at him 
— obviously they didn’t recognize 
exiles. He dove for the roof of the 
infirmary, grabbed a hyp-pistol 
from beside the car’s seat, and 
climbed out. 

“I’ll be quick.” 

He ran to the entrance and down 



the ramp. The infirmary was al- 
most deserted — everybody seemed 
to have run into the streets. He 
pushed past bewildered personnel, 
found the stockroom untended 
and scooped up packets of anti- 
biotics. No time for specialized 
medicines now. One arm laden, 
he hurried back to the ramp, got 
up it without being questioned 
and dashed for the grav car. He 
tossed in the packets and jumped 
in after them. 

As he zoomed toward South 
Fence again he realized that the 
people were shouting more 
raggedly and that they weren’t 
staring at him, but at something 
else in the sky. He jerked a look 
upward — and abruptly went rigid 
in the seat. The car shot on unat- 
tended. 

T he sun was near enough dawn 
so that Main Hull was illu- 
minated. But it no longer hung 
west of the colony — it was nearly 
overhead. And it looked bigger — 
so big he could clearly see its ob- 
long shape. 

One of the men in the rear seats 
choked: “It’s coming down — ” 
Kreg’s thoughts churned. He 
grabbed for the controls and sent 
the car shooting eastward toward 
the Sunrise Hills. The last thing he 
wanted to do — if Main Hull had 
somehow come to life — was lead it 
toward the tribe. He craned his 
neck to watch the bright growing 
object. 



166 



IF 




He saw Main Hull enter shadow. 
Shortly thereafter a succession of 
tiny lights appeared and scattered 
in various directions. They looked 
like the running-lights of gravcars, 
high up. Several seemed to be 
matching his course. He let the car 
shoot onward for a while, until it 
became obvious that three or four 
of the lights were pursuing him, 
then he swerved. They swerved 
with him, staying almost directly 
above, meanwhile dropping rapidly 
closer. 

He was among the lower hills 
now. He saw a blast of light over- 
head, then a moving streak. A mis- 
sle! It flashed down ahead of him, 
hit a slope, and exploded blinding- 
ly. There was only a little noise. 

That was a signal rocket, then. 
And no doubt it was intended as a 
warning shot. He swerved again, 
made sure the car was at full speed 
and watched with growing despair 
as the pursuers closed in easily. He 
thought for a moment of making a 
stubborn suicidal fight. 

But curiosity, as much as any- 
thing else, made him reach slowly 
for the controls and slow down. His 
passengers were glumly silent. 

And then a greatly amplified 
voice came from one of the grav- 
cars now circling him. “Don’t 
waste time running, Tomsun. We 
can blast you to atoms. Surrender 
and you’ll get a fair hearing.” 

Dumbfounded, he slumped in 
the seat. The voice was Captain 
Gerlik’s! 



Slowly a thought wormed into 
his mind. If Captain Gerlik hadn’t 
been destroyed — if the bullet 
hadn’t plowed through the Brain 
after all — maybe Uncle Ben and 
the others were alive too! 



T he whole raiding party, in- 
cluding Nujent’s small contin- 
gent, were locked in what had been 
Landington’s second-largest audi- 
torium. They were given food and 
water and a portable stove so they 
could feed themselves. What wirnv 
dows they could reach were 
blacked out with heavy steel plates 
that could not be moved, so that 
they couldn’t see what was going 
on outside. Something was. They 
could hear citizens passing, some- 
times in quiet-talking groups, 
sometimes running and shout- 
ing. And heavy work of some kind 
was going on. Maybe repairs were 
being made to Nose Cone, or to 
Main Hull. And there were sounds 
as if considerable cargoes were 
being unloaded and hauled away 
by gravtrucks. 

Pendergast first spoke the 
thought that may have been in the 
minds of all the prisoners. “I’ll bet 
you these clothes I’m wearing that 
they’re going to put us in Main 
Hull and send it back into orbit. 
Maybe they’ll rig TV cameras so 
people can watch us starve or go 
mad. I’ll tell you this — if they do. 
I’ll find some way to sabotage the 
damned thing. I won’t have my 



HOT WORLD 



167 




bones hanging up there as an ob- 
ject lesson!” 

One of the others muttered, 
“Your plans haven’t worked very 
well so far.” 

Pendergast grinned. “At least we 
made an impression. We brought 
Main Hull down — that’ll earn us a 
place in history!” 

Someone said, “The damned 
thing was supposed to be empty 
and inert.” 

Pendergast shrugged. “Obvious- 
ly it wasn’t. There were motors in 
working order, and fissionables to 
power them. And the Brains were 
in contact with it — they were able 
to bring it down, or at least Gerlik 
was. If I’d only made sure — ” 

Kreg said dully. “I khoM^ the 
Brains were behind those sensors in 
the cabinets. The bullet couldn’t 
possibly have missed.” 

Talk dwindled. Some of the men 
improvised gambling games. Some 
slept, or pretended to. In any case, 
days and nights passed. 

O N THE evening of the fourth 
day there was a strange rum- 
bling that shook the building. Pen- 
dergast suggested. 

“Testing out the drive.” 

No one argued. 

That night dragged by. Then, as 
daylight filtered through the few 
cracks around windows, noises 
came from the main entrance. 

Pendergast and some of the oth- 
ers were suddenly in a crouch, 
chairs or other objects in their 



hands for weapons. But Gerlik’s 
amplified voice came through the 
heavy doors: “You may come out 
whenever you wish.” 

Nobody moved for a minute, 
then there was a rush. Kreg sup- 
posed the others were wondering, 
as he was, what kind of weapons 
would be trained on them. Some- 
one threw open the doors and he 
blinked in sunlight. 

He was perhaps the fourth one 
out. He stood silent with the 
others, staring up. 

Already a mile or so above the 
city. Main Hull was rising slowly 
— with Nose Cone in place atop it! 
Kreg’s eyes darted to where Nose 
Cone had stood and found the 
gaping hole. An odd fright lanced 
through him. South Fence was 
there and so were the familiar 
buildings. The absence of Nose 
Cone was as dismaying as if he’d; 
awakened some morning and 
found both his hands missing. 

He stared upward again and saw 
a single gravear, tiny with dis- 
tance, approach the Ship and van- 
ish into it. 

Long after the reassembled Ship 
was invisible, he stared up. Then, 
neck cramped and aching, he low- 
ered his head. He supposed he 
looked as lost as the men around 
him. 

T hey found seven people — five 
men, one boy, and one wom- 
an — hiding about the abandoned 
city. Possibly, Kreg supposed, a 



168 



IF 




few others would be scattered 
about the farms. 

A few gravcars were left. Except 
for what little was in the cars’ con- 
verters, there were no fissionables 
and no other sources of power. 
Food supplies were mostly gone, 
and so was most of the metal and 
other things. But what was left, 
though a puny treasure by the col- 
ony’s standards, was vastly more 
than Pendergast could have 
dreamed of capturing. 

Two days later, when more of 
the tribe had been flown in, some- 
one found the voice reel with its 
recorded message. They brought it 
to Kreg because it spoke his name, 
and because the voice was Ben 
Tomsun’s. 

“Kreg Tomsun,’’ it said, “by 
now you know that New Eden be- 
longs to you exiles. 

“The Brains, and various other 
things, were frauds. The intelli- 
gences known as Captain Gerlik 
and the others, including me, were 
programed in the computers of 
Main Hull. They were human 
minds once, but now they’re col- 
lections of tiny wires and crystals. 

“ A colony ship, being on its own 
once it leaves Sol, must be ready 
for whatever it finds. Had we land- 
ed first on a fertile planet, the plan 
would have been different. As it 
was, we bred tough colonists by ex- 
iling hardy, combative people into 
the harsh environment. 

“Your erstwhile neighbors of 
the colony aren’t entirely happy 



about being suddenly evacuated 
like this, but they’ll grow content 
with shipboard life as their 
ancestors did. Some day, with luck, 
they’ll be landed on a lusher planet. 
If not, we’ll have to repeat the 
process of selection. If we — the 
Brains and the Ship — wear out 
before we find a soft planet, at least 
we’ll have left a few vigorous 
human colonies. 

“We leave you to each other, 
which implies a certain amount of 
future conflict. But frankly— es- 
pecially in view of the alien arti- 
fact’s you recently dug up — I en- 
vy you. 

“Please believe that there are 
sound reasons why we had to act as 
we did. We have vanity enough left 
so we don’t want you to think ill of 
us. “Goodbye, and good luck.’’ 

There were no other messages. 

Several days later a thought 
struck Kreg. He sought out 
Pendergast. 

“I’ll bet you these clothes,” he 
told the bearded man, “that if we 
dig into that culvert system we 
crawled through, we’ll find sensors 
of some kind that told the Brains 
exactly when we came in and 
where. I’ll bet you, furthermore, 
that if we look around we’ll find a 
dozen other ways through the 
fence, all set up for us. The Brains 
wanted it that way. We would 
have had to be very stupid to have 
failed.” 

Pendergast grinned at him and 
declined the bet. •

were strangers. Most writers have a 
great deal of difficulty resur- 
recting the people who lived 
originally until ‘The End” came 
off the typewriter and then ef- 
fectively died, leaving only 
memories. 

Whatever the reasons, most se- 
quels are vaguely disappointing. 
I’ve seldom tried writing one 
except in the teen-age cate- 
gory — and then only once and 
reluctantly. When I had to do a 
third in the series, I knew 1 would 
do better using a different char- 
acter and shifting the background 
ahead in time. 

Yet when a writer is able to bring 
off a sequel to a novel and make it 
stronger and better than the 
original, the result is a happy 
event. When all the material we 
have enjoyed once is made fresh 
again and is made to grow and 
become enriched before us, the 
old book is also made better for 
us. In that case our pleasure is not 
merely doubled, but effectively 
squared. 

Dragonquest, by Anne McCaf- 
frey (Ballantine, 95cX is a sequel 
that is in all ways far better than 
the original. That is saying a great 
deal, since her Dragonflight won 
both the Nebula and Hugo awards. 
The new book also has a cover (by 
the same artist) that is much bet- 
ter than the one on the earlier book 
and that actually illustrates a 



scene in the novel. Most unusual. 

As most science-fiction readers 
must know by now the original 
novel dealt with the Dragonriders 
of a planet called Pern. They were 
the descendants of Earth colonists 
who had forgotten their origin and 
developed their own feudal society. 
Their world was a good one, ex- 
cept that about every two hundred 
years it was menaced by a fall of 
ravening and deadly “threads” — 
spores of virulent life — that were 
cast across space from another 
planet, known as the Red Star. To 
overcome this danger they had 
bred a native life-form into huge 
dragons — creatures that could fly 
with a rider and could literally 
breathe out fire that consumed the 
threads in the air before they could 
take root. The dragons were tele- 
pathic and could be controlled by 
the rare humans who could com- 
mune with them; they were also 
capable of teleporting instantly 
from 6ne place to another. 

The story was of the training of 
Lessa to handle her queen dragon, 
Ramoth, in preparation for the 
next threadfall. When disaster 
struck, however, the people real- 
ized that the one Weyr — dragon- 
hold — left on Pern was totally in- 
adequate for the job. And Lessa 
forced her dragon back through 
time, rather than space, to bring 
other Weyrs from the past to help 
— gaining F’lar as her mate. 



170 



IF 




Fine. The story had richness and 
color. The science was not too be- 
lievable, since such huge beasts 
would need a few miracles of 
musculature and airloading to 
fly and since almost everything 
depended on extraordinary psi 
powers. But as science-fantasy, it 
was handled well, though the solu- 
tion to all the problems always 
struck me as being a mite too pat. 
Lessa goes back and asks the 
ancient weyrleaders to follow her 
through time and they do — ^just 
about like that. All we really got to 
know of them was their amazing 
amiability. 

Anne McCaffrey cannot be ac- 
cused of not letting us know more 
about them in the current novel. 
She has taken a deep and thought- 
ful look at them and at her whole 
world and world history as well as 
at the probable results of this sim- 
ple solution to the problems of 
Pern. 

Her use of what is left us from 
the first book is a fine example of 
how to rethink a story. We start 
with a group of leaders who are 
completely familiar with fighting 
threads and whose ideas — while 
proven by experience — are cen- 
turies out of date. They are not 
going to swallow the leadership 
of the relatively inexperienced 
F’lar and Lessa for very long — not 
when they find that the youngsters 
are filled with all kinds of silly no- 
tions that could lead to the end of 
the supremacy of dragonriders in 



general !^We also have a bunch of 
predictions by F’lar that were too 
simple and easy in the original— 
and are now being proved danger- 
ously wrong. And suddenly the his- 
tory of Pern and its heritage — ap- 
parently almost neglected for mil- 
lennia — becomes important and 
complicated. We begin with a ba- 
sis for a fine conflict — but a great 
deal more is added to heighten it. 

Before, we had a world of peas- 
ants (and a few petty lords) ar- 
rayed against the dragonriders. 
This time we have the texture of a 
full society. The characters are 
presented in the context of their 
varying occupations right through 
the entertainer-harpists who hold 
past and future in their hands and 
what the danger means to each be- 
comes real. Anne McCaffrey’s 
world comes to life. Incidentally, 
so does the Red Star and its true 
menace. 

The life of the dragonriders is 
explored in depth. We finally be- 
gin to know what it means to be 
linked to a great brute, to sense the 
character of the dragons (as well 
as what they came from) and to 
realize by being shown — not mere- 
ly told — what it must be like to 
have the intimate bond between 
dragon and rider ripped away by 
the sudden death of one. 

Very little is easily obvious in 
this novel but all seems obvious 
when the story ends — the mark of a 
first-rate author. The book is not 
as simple as its predecessor but it 



READING ROOM 



171 




remains alive and easy to read. A 
list of characters and their places 
in the scheme is included; it isn't 
necessary but it is a convenience. 
A map of the planet is also shown, 
but is not adequate. Not all locales 
important in the book are marked 
on it and the whole Southern Con- 
tinent is not only missing but isn’t 
even indicated by distance or di- 
rection. You’ll have to remember 
that Southern Weyr is not con- 
nected and is to the south, off the 
map. It won’t matter if you don’t 
try to find it there, however. The 
map is the poorest feature of this 
book — fortunately it is unneces- 
sary. 

Summed up, this is at least twice*, 
as good a novel as the one that won 
all the prizes. Given the basic ele- 
ments of the dragons and their 
powers, it is consistent, logical 
and excellent science fiction. 
Here is a world, a people and a 
history. There is no too-simple 
solution this time, but the careful 
result of what is well prepared. 

At the end McCaffrey leaves 
room for another novel to follow, 
since the Red Star remains a chal- 
lenge, as does the true future of the 
dragonriders. There is no need for 
another, however — the book is 
complete. 

Dragonquest is the best science- 
fiction novel I’ve seen in the first 
half of 1971. Don’t miss it. 

A nother sequel that is bet- 
^ter by far than its predecessor 



is borderline science fiction. The 
story might be considered sword- 
and-sorcery fantasy, but it touches 
enough on certain intriguing spec- 
ulative realities to make it accept- 
able to many sf readers who do 
not normally look at most fantasy. 

The Black Mountains, by Fred 
Saberhagen (Ace, 600), is a sequel 
to The Broken Lands — and while 
the first book left me satisfied but 
not greatly impressed, the new 
one strikes me as a first-rate job. 
At his best Saberhagen can write 
with a satisfying richness and 
power 1 had not expected even 
after reading his excellent “Ber- 
serker” stories. 

Overtly this is another story of a 
world long after the collapse — 
technology has been lost and either 
magic or a strange sorcery based 
on shreds of science has taken over. 
The first book was the story of a 
band of men rebelling against the 
dictatorship of the lords who ruled 
the Black Mountains. 

This novel takes over after the 
first success, when the victors 
suddenly realize the size of the Job 
they have taken on and realize that 
they cannot simply remain free, 
but must actually storm the seem- 
ingly impregnable bastions of 
power — power they only partly 
know and against which they have 
virtually no weapons. 

From the outset the book breaks 
away from the obvious. The reader 
no longer follows the viewpoint of 
a boy, but that of one of the con- 



172 



IF 




quered, beaten and maimed leaders 
of the evil power clique. 

I won’t try to sum up the plot. 
Some of the elements are familiar 
enough, but Saberhagen’s writing 
and development of the details 
remove them from the obvious. 
And parts of the story are pure joy. 
There is the control of a djinn 
(well, call him that, though he’s 
part Yankee mechanic and part 
Vulcan) who will do exactly what 
he’s told about building aircraft 
for a wizard who has only a 19th- 
century picture oT aircraft to 
guide him. There is a magic healing 
lake and the Lord Draffut, who 
presides over it; call him a god if 
you like — or try to see what Saber- 
hagen has done with one of man’s 
oldest servants who has evolved in 
mind and body. And there is 
throughout a marvelous analysis 
of the workings of magic and the 
true nature of demons. 

The magic and the demons are 
real enough — not Just trickery to 
turn normal scientific gimmicks 
against a superstitious people. 
Bits and hints throughout show 
that Saberhagen is really writing 
science fiction — though he con- 
ceals his science most of the time. 
In the end I have to conclude that 
both the odd handling of a return- 
ing technology from tatters of the 
past and the curious logic lying 
behind the demonology make the 
book at least first-rate science 
fantasy. 

I suspect there will be yet an- 



other in the series, since Saber- 
hagen has only begun to expose his 
rationale. Still, he has written a 
good novel by itself and there is a 
zest and a feel to the writing that 
made it irresistible to me. There 
are few writers who can do justice 
to a really rich set of characters 
and backgrounds, and Saberhagen 
has already proved he is one of the 
best. 

Unless you can’t al^ide even a 
touch of magic, don’t miss this 
novel. Start with the first — if you 
still can fine it — but read the sequel 
in any event. It will stand well by it- 
self. 

The Tactics of Mistake, by Gor- 
don R. Dickson (Doubleday, 
$4.95), isn’t exactly a sequel. For 
want of a better word, let’s call it a 
prequel, because it takes place be- 
fore the novel it follows in date of 
publication. It uses the back- 
ground of history of Dickson’s 
“Dorsai” stories — such as the 
Genetic General. But Tactics be- 
gins at an early period and traces 
the founding of the world of 
Dorsai, from which later empires 
were to hire the marvelous mer- 
cenary troops that supported the 
turmoil of interstellar civiliza- 
tion for centuries. 

I don’t think the book is better 
than The Genetic General. Both

in equally stirring events and both 
are obsessed by a vision of the 
breakup of their form of civiliza- 
tion and the only possible cure. 

Yet I cannot help feeling that 
Cletus makes a better hero than his 
later descendant. Donal had a 
miracle up his sleeve — he ^ould 
levitate, though he didn’t bother 
with such tricks. Cletus has no such 
ability. He is limited to what a 
human being can do at the height 
of his powers. He has only a vision 
of what must be and a skill at us- 
ing the mistakes of others to force 
victory from them. He is also 
willing to pay the ultimate price 
for his vision, if need be. To me, 
this makes his struggles and 
triumph greater. Also, his in- 
evitable girl friend-enemy is a lot 
more believable than the rather 
overbred and finicky heroine 
Donal drew. 

In this prequel, since characters 
and background are not exactly 
those of the Dorsai series, Dick- 
son has no problem bringing new 
thought and freshness to the story 
line. The plot is related to the fu- 
ture of the Dorsai stories depicted 
in the series but it can stand alone. 
And reading provides new in- 
sights. 

Tactics is a thoroughly good ad- 
venture story with some depth. 
There is no simple conflict with a 
single menace — the action takes 
place against a complex of ele- 
ments — good, evil, wisdom and 
stupidity — as should be true of any 



good novel. The lead character is a 
super-hero who is somehow so in- 
tensely human that the reader can 
readily accept him. 

To see what can happen to even 
one of our best writers down the 
sequel trail, read Poul Anderson’s 
Operation Chaos (Doubleday, 
$4.95). The novel is the result of 
putting together four novelettes 
'written over some thirteen years. 

The first part of the book is 
lovely indeed. The stories deal with 
an alternate world where science 
discovered the laws of magic and 
put it to work in a war even greater 
than World War H. The magic 
here is reminiscent of old issues of 
Unknown, for which these stories 
would have been written, had the 
magazine still existed. There is a 
lovely, wacky logic behind the 
whole business of using the laws 
of physics and chemistry general- 
ly to support lycanthropy and 
practical witchcraft in defeating 
the machinations of the enemy. 

The three initial novelettes were 
excellent in magazine form and 
are still good in the book. The third 
doesn’t quite measure up — its 
potential has already been 
drained by the preceding material. 
After an afreet and a wild sala- 
mander, an incubus is not much 
more menacing. Anderson seems 
to recognize this and dredges the 
devil out of hell in an effort to por- 
tray a major menace. And so, in 
more than one way, the novel itself 
goes to hell. And something that 



174 



IF 




began as brightly amusing sudden- 
ly has turned to darkness and hor- 
ror. 

Besides, we have reached be- 
yond the limits where we can sus- 
pend disbelief. If we accept any- 
thing like a classical devil and hell 
we’re not going to be able to swal- 
low the fact that our witch and 
werewolf can suddenly develop 
powers to equal the ones that 
brought war among the Shining 
Ones and shook the very throne of 
Heaven. 



A writer can as easily extend in- 
to absurdity as to reduce to 
it — perhaps more easily. And that 
is the final risk of sequelization. 
Except in very carefully planned 
series, there are limits to what can 
be made of the initial situation and 
anything more becomes absurd. 

It takes hard thought, excellent 
craftsmanship — and restraint— to 
turn out a sequel better than a 
good original novel. But the few 
successes still make science fic- 
tion a great field to be in. • 



ORNITHANTHROPUS 

The blow never came. 

They were past the cliff. 

S CHADOW saw the draftfall as 
a glimmering mass of air that 
spilled over the lip of the cliff and 
tumbled toward the broken land. 
He had often seen such sights from 
afar but this was the first time he 
had been in one. Like every winged 
creature on every world, he 
normally knew bettef than to fly 
into the currents on the lee side of 
a mountain. 

The downdraft caught him and 
Garp in its grip and threw them 
violently at the rocks. Garp 
howled, dropping his sword, which 
spun into a fang below him. Each 
member of the pack played 
frantically with his antigrav. But 
the air tossed them about like wood 
chips in a raging river. The down- 



( Continued from page 138) 

fall was too powerful to be beaten 
by the puny devices of man. 

Schadow made no attempt to 
outfly the draft. Putting his arms 
next to his body in a swept-back 
position, straightening his legs, 
hitching forward at the waist and 
angling his aching wings close to 
his sides, he formed his body into 
an elementary airfoil, skidding 
through the air at an angle. 

He closed his lower lids against 
the vicious winds and through 
them saw the fangs, the whole' 
scene faded by the protective tis- 
sue so that it seemed that it hap- 
pened in the depths of a faintly 
pink sea. 

Yen’s corpse was first to hit, 
smashing spread-eagled atop an 
altar of rock not two meters from 
the base of the cliff. Two others hit 
farther out. Silently, explosively 



175 





they touched the ground, their 
screams and the crashes coming 
weakly through the winds after the 
fact. A fourth hit a shallow pool, 
sending up a shower of scummed 
water and insects. A fifth had 
slowed himself a bit with his anti- 
grav and it seemed to Schadow that 
his screams must have continued 
for a second after he had hit. 

Garp was a fast learner. On 
seeing Schadow he had copied the 
airfoil design, getting added 
spoiling from his antigrav. But he 
was too late and too low. The false 
Buddha smashed into a jagged 
outcropping of volcanic glass, be- 
heading himself. 

The pink-tinted ground was get- 
ting dangerously close. -Schadow 
felt the skeletal claws of oblivion 
drag along his spine. 

Then he was out of the draftfall 
and in a turbulent but strong wave 
lift beyond. Extending his wings, 
he soared into the sky and opened 
his lids to its eternal blue. 

He looked down. Scattered on 
the ground were the twisted and 
broken forms of the fangs. Some- 
how an antigrav unit had been 
torn loose from a corpse and, free 
of its weight, clattered along under 
the force of the draftfall until clear 
and then shot through the air to- 
ward the base, perhaps on a 
homing signal. Three of the 
corpses, he noticed, were also be- 
ginning to move across the rocks, 
being pulled by devices that had 
outlasted their owners. 



The skyhunter still floated where 
he had left it. 

Did he dare to hope? 

Though he was unarmed, he 
settled into a straightaway glide 
toward the beast. 

It was obviously as near exhaus- 
tion as he but appeared unhurt. 
There was no reason for it to stay 
away from its sea hunting — un- 
less if was waiting for him. It could 
be purposely baiting him, he told 
himself. Vengeance was not sole- 
ly a human passion. 

He slowed and circled before its 
massive head. 

The amber eyes watched him. 

Slowly, carefully the tentacle 
moved toward him. He stayed in 
his tight orbit, not moving away. 
The auxuli^ry eye at the tip of the 
tentacle opened — the tentacle it- 
self touched his arm. 

No poison cells opened to de- 
stroy him. The tentacle remained 
soft and gentle. 

Laughing, Schadow grabbed 
the tentacle and the skybeast, 
tender as he remembered an- 
other of its kind, grabbed him. 

It placed Schadow atop its 
bladder, where he could sit and 
rest. He didn’t mind the fact that 
the skin was almost unbearably 
hot from the sun. He laughed 
again. The beast moved its tentacle 
joyfully and the dragon-amphib- 
ians that guarded the seacliffs 
screamed at them as they moved 
through the sky and over the sea, 
once-enemies, now-brothers. •

Depending on your perspective, knowledge, 
imagination, the answer can be simple or 
complex, commonplace or extraordinary, def- 
inite or infinite. 

We’d like to introduce you to some unique- 
ly gifted authors who have created an excit- 
ing, mind-stretching literature. Writers who 
can look at a dot or a pebble and see a uni- 
verse of sub-atomic particles. Who can 
speculate on the incredible number of inter- 
dependent cells that make up a human body 



and envision .whole planetary life forms inter- 
connected the same way. 

Who forecast things like nuclear power, 
supersonic jets, computers, space probes, and 
moon walks long before they happened. Sci- 
ence Fiction authors are writing tomorrow’s 
history today.
