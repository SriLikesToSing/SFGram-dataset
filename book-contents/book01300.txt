THERE axe some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

The 

CASTLE of LIGHT 

by KEITH LAUMER 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Retief knew the Groaci were frying 
to steal this world— trouble was, 
the world didn't seem to mind a bit! 



I 

R etief scaled his pale burgundy 
afternoon informal beret across 
the office, narrowly missing the 
clothes tree, and dumped the heavy 
carton he was carrying on his desk. 
A shapely brunette with a turned-up 
nose appeared at the connecting 
door to the next office. 



“Miss Braswell,” he said before 
she could speak. “I have here two 
handsome half-Hter wine glasses 
which Fm about to field-test. Will 
you join me?” 

She made a shushing motion, 
rolling her eyes toward the inner 
office. A narrow, agitated face ap- 
peared over her shoulder. 

“Retief!” Consul-General Mag- 



8 



nan burst out. “I’ve been at wit’s 
end! How does it happen that every 
time catastrophe strikes you’re out 
of the office?” 

“It’s merely a matter of timing,” 
Retief said soothingly, stripping 
paper from the package. He pulled 
out a tulip-shaped goblet which 
seemed to be made of coils of jewel- 
colored glass welded together in an 
intricate pattern. He held it up to 
the light. 

“Pretty, eh? And barely cool from 
the glass-blower.” 

“While you idled about the ba- 
zaar,” Magnan snapped, his face an 
angry pink above a wide, stiff collar 
of yellow plastiweave, “I’ve been 
coping single-handed with disaster! 
I suggest you put aside your baubles; 
I’m calling a formal Emergency 
Staff Meeting in two minutes!” 
“That means you, me and Miss 
Braswell, I take it, since the rest 
of the staff is off crater-viewing — ” 
“Just you and I.” Magnan mopped 
at his face with a vast floral-pattern- 
ed tissue. “This is a highly classi- 
fied emergency.” 

“Oh, goody. I’ll take the rest of 
the afternoon off and watch the 
festivities.” Miss Braswell winked at 
Retief, extended the tip of her ton- 
gue in salute to the Consul-General’s 
back, and was gone. 

Retief plucked a bottle from his 
desk drawer and followed Magnan 
into the inner office. The senior 
officer yanked at his stiff collar, now 
wilting with perspiration. 

“Why this couldn’t have waited 
until Minister Barnshingle’s return, I 
don’t know,” he said. “He’s already 
a day overdue. I’ve tried to contact 



him, to no avail. This primitive line- 
of-sight local telescreen system — ” 
He broke off. “Retief, kindly defer 
your tippling until after the crisis!” 
“Oh, this isn’t tippling, Mr. Mag- 
nan. I’m doing a commodity analy- 
sis for my next report. You fobbed 
the detail of Commercial Attache 
off on me, if you recall.” 

“As Charge d’affaire in the ab- 
sence of the Minister, I forbid drink- 
ing on duty!” Magnan roared. 

“Surely you jest, Mr. Magnan! 
It would mean the end of diplomacy 
as we know it.” 

“Well, not until after lunch, at 
least. And I hereby authorize you to 
postpone market research until fur- 
ther notice; we’re facing a possible 
holocaust in a matter of hours!” 
“What’s it all about?” 

M agnan plucked a sheet of yellow 
paper from his desk and hand- 
ed it to Retief. “This came in over 
the autotyper forty minutes ago.” 

UNIDENTIFIED CONVOY COMPRISING 
FIFTY UHLAN CLASS VESSELS SIGHTED 
ON COURSE FOR YALC III ETA 1500 
GST 33 OCT GSC. SIGNED POMFROY, 
ENSIGN PATROL NAVY 786-G. 

“Uhlans,” Retief said. “Those are 
thousand-man transports. And oh- 
nine-hundred on the thirty-third is 
just about two hours from now.” 
“This could be an invasion, Re- 
tief! A major breach of the peace! 
Can you imagine how it would look 
in my record if the planet were in- 
vaded under my very nose!” 

“Tough on the natives, too,” Re- 
tief commented. “What action have 
you taken so far?” 



6 



IP 




“Action? Why, I’ve canceled this 
afternoon’s social engagements, 
checked out-going passenger sche- 
dules . and sharpened a number 
of pencils.” 

“Have you tried contacting this 
Ensign Pomfroy for a little more 
detail?” 

“There’s no one on duty in the 
Message Center but a local Code 
Clerk. He’s trying to raise him now.” 
Magnan depressed a button on his 
desk. “Oo-Gilitit, have you met with 
any success?” 

“Pomfroy-Tic all same have organ 
cluster up ventral orifice — ” 

“Gilitit, I’ve warned you to watch 
your language!” Magnan roared. 
“It’s no habit for a communications 
man to get into!” He clicked off. 
“Confounded locals! It’s hopeless, 
of course. Our equipment was never 
designed for pinpointing moving pat- 
rol boats at four A-U’s.” 

“How do the Yalcan’s feel about 
the situation?” asked Retief, playing 
with the goblet still in his hand. 

Magnan blinked. “Why, as to that, 
1 — ah — was just going to call Oo- 
Rilikuk.” Magnan punched keys, 
tuned in a bland yellow and blue 
face with eyes like gold pinheads, 
and vertically-hinged jaws busy 
with an oily drumstick. 

“Ah, there, Magnan,” a voice 
like an uncoiled wheel said. “Just 
finishing Up my lunch. Roast haunch 
of giant locust. Delicious.” A ton- 
gue like a length of green silken 
rope flicked a tidbit from a corner 
of the lipless mouth. 

“Oo-Rilikuk, do you know any- 
thing of a large convoy due here 
today?” 



R ilikuk dabbed at his chin with 
a gossamer napkin. “I seem to 
recall issuing a number of visas to 
Groaci nationals in recent weeks.” 
“Groaci? Fifty shiploads of 
them?” 

“Something like that,” the Yalcan 
said carelessly. “By the way, if you 
haven’t already made arrangements, 
perhaps you’d care to join my Bach- 
elor’s Group for the upcoming fes- 
tivities — ” 

“You’re not concerned? Perhaps 
you’re not aware of the insidious 
reputation the Groaci enjoy!” 

“I don’t mind saying I’ve exer- 
cised a trifle of influence to procure 
a choice mud pocket. The rich, 
oleaginous kind, you know. And 
there’ll be no shortage of nubile 
females along — though you’re not 
organized to appreciate the latter, 
it’s true — ” 

“May I ask the state of the plan- 
etary defenses, Rilikuk? I’m warn- 
ing you, Groaci can’t be trusted!” 
“Planetary defenses?” Rilikuk is- 
sued a chirrup of amusement. “As 
confirmed pacifists, we’ve never felt 
the need for such an extravagance. 
Now, I'll be leaving the office in 
a few minutes. Suppose I drop by 
for you. We’ll go on to my place 
for dinner, then off to the bog — ” 
“You’re leaving the Foreign Of- 
fice at a moment like this?” Mag- 
nan yelped. “They’ll be landing in 
a matter of minutes!” 

“I fear I’ll have no time to devote 
to tourism this week, Magnan,” Rili- 
kuk said. “They’ll just have to man- 
age alone. After all, Voom Festival 
comes but once in ninety-four stan- 
dard years.”

IF 




Magnan rang off with a snort. 
“We’ll receive scant help from that 
quarter.” He swiveled to gaze out 
the unglazed window across the gay 
tiles of the plaza, lined with squat, 
one-story shops of embossed and 
colored ceramic brick, to the glitter- 
ing minarets of the mile-distant 
temple complex. 

“If these idlers invested less ener- 
gy in shard-sorting and more in 
foreign affairs, I wouldn’t be faced 
with this contretemps.” 

“If the CDT would talk Groac 
into selling them a few thousand 
tons of sand, they wouldn’t have to 
sort shards.” 

“There are better uses for CDT 
bottoms than hauling sand, Retief 
. though I notice the local scrap 
pile is about depleted. Possibly now 
they’ll turn to more profitable pur- 
suits than lavishing the artistry of 
generations on tenantless shrines.” 
He indicated the cluster of glass 
towers sparkling in the sun. “They 
might even consent to export a rea- 
sonable volume of glassware in place 
of the present token amounts.” 
“Rarity keeps the price up; and 
they say they can’t afford to let 
much glass off-world. It all goes 
back in the scrap piles when it’s 
broken, for reuse.” 

Magnan stared across the plain, 
where the white plumes of small 
geysers puffed into brief life, while 
the pale smoke rising from the fu- 
maroles rose straight up in the still 
air. Far above, a point of blue light 
twinkled. 

“Odd,” Magnan said, frowning. 
“I’ve never seen one of the moons 
in broad daylight before.” 



Retief came to the window. 
“You still haven’t. Apparently our 
Groaci friends are ahead of sche- 
dule. That’s an ion drive, and it’s not 
over twenty miles out.” 

U 

M agnan bounded to his feet. 

“Get your hat, .Retief! We’ll 
confront these interlopers the mo- 
ment they set foot on Yalcan soil! 
The Corps isn’t letting this sort of 
thing pass without comment!” 

“The Corps is always a fast group 
with a comment.” Retief said. “I’ll 
give it that.” 

Outside, the plaza was a-bustle 
with shopkeepers glittering in holi- 
day glass jewelry, busily closing up 
their stalls, erecting intricate decora- 
tions resembling inverted chandeliers 
before the shuttered shops, and ex- 
changing shouted greetings. A long- 
bodied pink-and-red-faced Yalcan in 
a white apron leaning in the open 
door of a shop waved a jointed 
forearm. 

“Retief-Tic! Do me honor of to 
drop in for last Voom cup before 
I lock up. Your friend, too!” 
“Sorry, Oo-Plif; duty calls.” 

“I see you’ve established your 
usual contacts among the undesir- 
able element,” Magnan muttered, 
signalling a boat-shaped taxi edging 
through the press on fat pneumatic 
wheels. “Look at these lackwitsi 
Completely engrossed in their fri- 
volity, while disaster descends 
scarcely a mile away.” 

Retief eyed the descending ship 
as it settled in behind the glittering 
spires of the temple-city. 



THE CASTLE OF LIGHT

"I wonder why they’re landing 
ttiere, instead of at the port,” Re- 
lief wondered. 

‘They’ve probably mistaken the 
shrine for the town,” Magnan snap- 
ped. “One must admit that it makes 
a far more impressive display than 
this collection of mud huts!” 

“Not the Groaci. They do their 
homework carefully before they 
start anything.” 

The cab pulled up and Magnan 
barked directions at the driver, who 
waved his forearms in the Yalcan 
equivalent of a shrug. 

“Speak to this fellow, Retief!” 
Magnan snapped. “Obscure dialects 
are a hobby of yours, I believe.” 

Retief gave the driver instructions 
in the local patois and leaned back 
against the floppy cushions. Mag- 
nan perched on the edge of the 
seat and nipped at a hangnail. The 
car cleared the square, racketed 
down a side street streaming with 
locals headed for the bog, gunned 
out across the hard-baked mud-flat, 
swerving violently around the bubbl- 
ing devil’s cauldrons of hot mud 
that dotted the way. A small geyser 
erupted with a whoosh! and spatter- 
ed the open vehicle with hot drop- 
lets. A whiff of rotten-egg smoke 
blew past. Off to the left, the sun- 
light glinted from the wide surface 
of the swaipp, thickly scattered with 
exotic lily-like flowers. Here and 
there, tree-ferns grew in graceful 
clumps from the shallow water. 
Along the shore, bright-colored tents 
had been erected, and local cele- 
brants clustered in groups among 
them, weaving to and fro and wav- 
ing their multiple arms. 



iiTt’s disgraceful,” Magnan sniff- 
-l-ed. “They’re already staggering 
and their infernal festival’s hardly 
begun!” 

“It’s a native dance,” Retief said. 
“Very cultural.” 

“What’s the occasion for this 
idiotic celebration? It seems to have 
completely paralyzed whatever ele- 
mentary sense of responsibility these 
flibertigibbets possess.” 

“It’s related in some way to the 
conjunction of the four moons,” Re- 
tief said. “But there’s more to it than 
that. It seems to have an important 
religious significance. The dances 
are symbolic of death and rebirth, 
or something of the sort.” 

“Hmmph! I see the dancers are 
now falling flat on their faces! Re- 
ligious ecstasy, no doubt!” 

As they swept past the reeling 
locals, the driver made cabalistic 
signs in the air and grabbed the 
steering bar just in time to swerve 
past a steam-jet that snored from a 
cleft boulder. Ahead, a cloud of dust 
was rolling out from the landing 
spot where the Groaci ship had set- 
tled in, a scant hundred yards from 
an outlying shrine, a sparkling fifty- 
foot tower of red, yellow and green 
glass. 

“They’re coming perilously close 
to violating the native holy place,” 
Magnan observed as the taxi pulled 
up beside the ship. “There may be 
mob violence at any moment.” 

A pair of locals, emerging from 
one of the many fanciful glass 
arches adorning the entrances to the 
shrine complex, cast no more than 
a casual glance at the vessel as a 
port opened in its side and a spindle- 



10 



IF 




legged Groaci in golfing knickers 
and loud socks appeared. 

Magnan climbed hurriedly from 
the cab. ‘‘I want you to note my 
handling of this, Retief,” he said 
behind his hand. “A firm word now 
may avert an incident.” 

“I’d better say a firm word to 
the driver, or we’ll be walking back.” 
“Look, Mac-Tic, I got a reserved 
slot in a hot pocket of mud waiting 
for me,” the driver called as he 
wheeled the car around. “Five min- 
utes, okay?” 

Retief handed the cabbie a ten 
credit token and followed Magnan 
across the scorched ground to the 
landing ladder. The Groaci descend- 
ed, all five eye-stalks canted in dif- 
ferent directions — One on Magnan. 

“Minister Barnshingle,” he said 
in his faint Groac voice before Mag- 
nan could speak. “I am Fiss, Tour 
Director for Groac Planetary Tours, 
Incorporated. I assume you’ve come 
to assist in clearing my little flock 
through the Customs and Immigra- 
tion formalities. Now — ” 

“Tour Director, did you say, Mr. 
Fiss?” Magnan cut in. “Fifty ship- 
loads of tourists?” 

“Quite correct. I can assure you 
that passports and visas are all in 
order, and immunization records are 
up-to-date. Since we Groaci have 
no diplomatic mission to Yale, it is 
most kind of the CDT to extend its 
good office.” 

“Just a minute, Mr. Fiss! How 
long are your tourists planning to 
stay on Yale? Just during the Voom 
Festival, I assume?” 

“I believe our visas read ... ah 
. indefinite, Mr. Minister.” 



“I’m Magnan, Charge in the ab- 
sence of the Minister,” Magnan said. 

F iss waved his eyes. “The Minis- 
ter is not here?” 

“No, he’s off mountain climbing. 
Very keen on sports. Now, ah, may 
I ask where your other forty-nine 
vessels might be?” 

“Just where is the Minister to be 
found?” Fiss enquired. 

“I really can’t say,” Magnan sniff- 
ed. “We’ve had no word for two 
days. Now, about your other ships,” 
Magnan persisted. 

“There are, I believe, forty-nine 
cities here on this charming little 
world,” Fiss said smoothly. “One 
transport is calling at each.” 

“Curious way to conduct a tour.” 
Magnan broke off as a cargo port 
rumbled open and a heavy six-wheel- 
ed vehicle churned out. Rows of 
multi-eyed Groaci heads peered over 
open sides, on which the words 
GROAC PLANETARY TOURS, 
INC. had been hastily lettered. A 
second vehicle followed the first, 
and a third and fourth. Magnan 
gaped as the emerging carriers took 
up positions in an orderly double 
file. 

“Here, what’s this, Fiss?” he 
blurted. “These are tourists?” 

“Of course? What else? Please not 
the presence of ladies and also a 
number of lovable Groaci grubs. 
Yes, innocent, fun-loving tourists 
all.” 

“Why are they in armored cars?” 
Magnan watched as the vehicles 
moved off in the direction of the 
towering glass temples. “Here, 
where are they going?” 



THE CASTLE OF LIGHT 



11 




Ill 



“Since the entire populace is fully 
occupied with Voom festival acti- 
vities,” Fiss hissed blandly, “Groac 
Tours has thoughtfully arranged to 
occupy available unused housing.” 
“Why, that’s the local Holy of 
Holies,” Magnan expostulated. “You 
can’t go in there!” 

“The structures are not in use,” 
Fiss whispered. “And I see no 
objection on the part of the aborig- 
ines.” He indicated the cab driver 
who was watching indifferently as 
the first tractor moved under a 
graceful crystalline arch into the 
sparkling glass-bricked avenue. 

“Hey, Mac-Tic,” the driver called 
to Retief in Yale. “Time’s up. I 
wanna get there before the mud 
cools!” 

“Are you out of your mind, Mr. 
Fiss?” Magnan demanded. “You’re 
deliberately precipitating an inci- 
dent! I’m warning you, I'll refer 
this to Sector HQ and call for a 
squadron of Peace Enforcers!” 
“What need for Peace Enforcers, 
my dear fellow?” Fiss murmured. 
“Peace reigns! We are unarmed. No 
act of violence is contemplated.” 
“We’ll see about this!” Magnan 
fumed. He turned and stamped to- 
ward the waiting taxi. 

“So thoughtful of you to welcome 
us,” Fiss’s faint voice followed him. 
“I shall be calling at the Legation 
later to arrange a number of for- 
malities. All quite legal, I assure 
you.” 

“It’s worse than I thought,” Mag- 
nan groaned to Retief as he climbed 
into the cab. “When a Groaci starts 
citing statutes, you can be sure 
there’s mischief afoot!” 



CC'T^his is incredible!” Magnan 
-I barked at the screen where 
Oo-Rilikuk’s multi-colored visage 
nodded blandly against a back- 
ground of sinously moving Yalcan 
dancing-wenches. “You calmly ad- 
mit that these foreigners are occupy- 
ing every pagoda on the planet, 
strewing dope-stick butts and — ” 
“This is Voom season, Mr. Mag- 
nan,” Rilikuk said reasonably. 
“What could be more fitting?” 
“Your concept of propriety con- 
founds me. There are fifty thou- 
sand of these fellows — and I have 
the distinct impression they’re plan- 
ning an extended stay!” 

“Very likely,” Rilikuk agreed, 
twitching in time to the music in 
the background. “And now, if you’ll 
excuse me . .” The screen blanked. 

Magnan threw up his hands. “I 
don’t like it, Retief. There’s an 
aspect of this we’re missing.” 

A chime sounded. The door open- 
ed and the Groaci Fiss bustled in, 
breathing noisily under the weight 
of a heavy briefcase. 

“Ah, Mr. Magnan! So good of 
you to await me. I have the papers 
here.” He hoisted the case onto the 
desk and undid stout straps. “Pm 
sure you’ll find all in order: Terri- 
torial claims, governmental charter, 
application for League memb»- 
ship — ” 

“What’s this?” Magnan scanned 
the heavy documents. “What are 
you saying sir? That Yale — that 
the Groaci — that you — ” 

“Quite right,” Fiss nodded. “This 
world is now Groaci property.” 



12 







There was a loud crash from the 
direction of the now deserted street. 
Magnan swiveled, stared out at a 
band of businesslike Groaci, hard 
at work on a shuttered shop with 
pry-bars. 

“What are they doing?” he yelp- 
ed. “Mr. Fiss, order those vandals 
away at once! The situation is get- 
ting out of hand!” 

“Not at all. Those chaps are 
merely following my instructions. 
And now if you have any belongings 
you wish to take along — ” 

“Eh? Belongings? Tm not going 
anywhere.” 

“Permit me to contradict you,” 
Fiss hissed softly, prodding a paper 
with a damp-looking finger. “This 
is the eviction order. I find that this 
humble structure will adequately ful- 
fill my requirement for a field-office 
here in the village.” 

“F-field office?” 

“I expect we shall be busy here 
for a few days,” Fiss said. “Trans- 
ferring useful items to our quarters,” 
He waved airily toward the spar- 
kling towers beyond the swamp. 

“You’re violating the Legation?” 
Magnan’s eyes bulged. 

“There has been a change of 
status quo since my arrival,” Fiss 
pointed out. “No formal relations 
exist between my government and 
the CDT. Therefore this is merely 
an office, and you are unregistered 
aliens.” 

“This is an outrage!” Magnan 
sputtered. “I’m not leaving!” 

“So?” Fiss murmured. He stepped 
to the door, opened it, waved in a 
quartet of bigger-than-average Groa- 
ci. 



44rx^ intimidate the soft ones,” 
A he hissed in Groaci. “To 
make threatening gestures.” 

Two of the newcomers stepped to 
Retief. He took them casually by 
their thin necks, escorted them to 
the window and tumbled them out. 
The second pair jumped at him in 
time to meet a stiff-arrri which 
slammed both of them onto their 
backs. Fiss emitted a’ weak but im- 
passioned bleat. 

“Unhand them, brute! These are 
lawfully appointed bailiffs!” 

Retief helped the stunned Groaci 
after their fellows and took a step 
toward Fiss. The Tour Director 
squeaked and darted through the 
door. 

“Retief!” Magnan yelped. “Stop! 
After all, these papers — ” 

Retief gathered in the parch- 
ments, tossed them after the intrud- 
ers. The outraged face of Tour 
Director Fiss appeared at the open- 
ing. 

“Ruffians! Bandits! Our legal and 
just claim — ” 

“ — isn’t worth the plastic it’s 
printed on,” Retief stated. “And if 
any more tourists wander into the 
Legation I won’t be so polite with 
them.” 

Fiss turned and made frantic ges- 
tures to the foraging crew. “To 
enter and evict the madmen!” he 
hissed. “To cast them forth bodily!” 

The several dozen Groaci who 
had gathered moved in a body to- 
ward the Legation door. 

“Fm disappointed in you, Fiss,” 
Retief said, shaking his head sadly. 
“I thought you were going to pre- 
tend that this was all perfectly legal. 



THE CASTLE OF LIGHT

and here you are about to violate a 
diplomatic mission in broad day- 
light.” 

Fiss hesitated, then hissed an 
order to his men. They halted. 

“Very well, Soft One,” he whisp- 
ered. “What need of force? Unlike 
the higher races, you require water 
at frequent intervals, I believe. Since, 
alas, I cannot authorize further de- 
liveries through the village mains, 
you will soon emerge to seek it. We 
'will be waiting.” 

M agnan tottered to Retief’s side. 

“Mr. Fiss,” he croaked. “This 
is madness! You can’t possibly hope 
to justify this outrageous seizure.” 
“On the contrary, Mr. Magnan,” 
Fiss waved a fistful of paper. “If you 
will re-read you Colonial Code, Title 
Three, Section XI, paragraph 9b, 
you will find that, and I quote, ‘any 
planetary body lacking an indigenous 
culture may be considered as avail- 
able for homesteading by any Power 
covenant to these articles.’ ” 

“Surely, Fiss, you don’t imply 
that Yale is uninhabited! Great 
Heavens, the world is known 
throughout the Sector for the beauty 
of its glass and ceramic work.” 

“I refer further to paragraph 12d, 
ibidem/^ Fiss bored on, “which pro- 
vides the following criteria for deter- 
mination of cultural level within the 
meaning of the Code (a) an ac- 
tive, organized government compe- 
tent to represent native interests; 
(b) a degree of social organization 
characterized by cities of at least 
one thousand inhabitants; and (c) 
individual or group I.Q., (as appli- 
cable) averaging .8 “standard” as 



evidenced by GST Test scores.” 
“Have you lost your wits?” Mag- 
nan cut in. “You’re standing in the 
midst of a Yalcan City! I deal daily 
with representatives of the Yalcan 
government! As for intelligence — ” 
**Inhahited city, Mr. Magnan, per- 
mit me to remind you. Minimum 
population, one thousand indivi- 
duals.” Fiss waved a hand at the 
empty street. “I see no individuals 
here.” 

“But they’re all away participating 
in a festival!” 

“As for government,” Fiss con- 
tinued blandly, “I have been totally 
unsuccessful in discovering any ac- 
tive organization. I confess I have 
been unable to secure a specimen of 
the local fauna for I.Q. Testing, but 
I feel sure any such effort would 
be unrewarding.” 

“You deliberately timed this coup 
to take advantage of local customs!” 
Magnan said in a shocked tone. 
“The code will be amended, Fiss!” 
The Groaci vibrated his throat 
sac, a contemptuous gesture. **Ex 
post facto legal manipulations can 
hardly be expected to affect the 
present situation retroactively, my 
dear Magnan.” 

Magnan clutched at the edge of 
the window. “Retief,” he gasped 
weakly. “This is insane, but I have 
a sudden, awful conviction that he’s 
legally on firm ground.” 

“Of course,” Fiss went on, “arti- 
cle 68 of the Code expressly prohi- 
bits occupation by force of any 
world, cultured or otherwise. How- 
ever, since our arrival was carried 
out in complete tranquility, this is 
hardly germane.”

IF 




“The festival will be over tomor- 
row,” Magnan burst out. “What 
then?” 

4 4XTOW that we have established 
legal possession of this plan- 
et,” Fiss whispered, “it will, of 
course, be necessary to enforce the 
just laws which are even now being 
enacted. To this end, certain arms 
are of course necessary.” He spat 
rapid Groacian at a trio of new- 
comers in black hipcloaks, who si- 
lently produced heavy particle-guns 
from sequinned holsters strapped to 
their thighs. 

“You aren’t planning — violence?” 
Magnan gasped. “Not against ms.'” 

“As to that,” Fiss whispered, “I 
was about to point out that natu- 
rally, a formal request for diplomatic 
status addressed to the present re- 
•gime would, of course, receive con- 
sideration.” 

“Tour Director Fiss — ” Magnan 
gulped. 

“Planetary Coordinator Pro-Tern 
Fiss, if you please,” the Groaci hiss- 
ed. “It is unfortunate that the large 
Soft One acted in such haste, but I 
am prepared to overlook the inci- 
dent.” 

“Why, ah, very good of you. I’m 
sure, Pla — ” 

“You’re out of luck, Fiss,” Retief 
cut in. “You’ll have to conduct your 
piracy without CDT sanction.” 

Magnan tugged at Retief’s sleeve. 
“Here, Retief! This is hardly a time 
for truculence!” 

“It’s as good a time as any, Mr. 
Magnan. And Minister Barnshingle 
might be irritated if he came back 
and discovered that these squatters 



had been recognized as a legal gov- 
ernment.” 

Magnan groaned. “I ... I suppose 
you’re right.” 

“So? But, no matter, Soft One,” 
Fiss whispered. “Why treat with 
underlings, eh? My scouts report a 
party of terrestrials in difficulty oil 
an awkward slope some leagues from 
here. Doubtless the person Barn- 
shingle of whom you speak will be 
grateful for relief. A timely rescue 
by selfless Groaci homesteaders wiU 
establish a correct mood for initia- 
tion of formal relations.” 

“The Minister’s in trouble?” Mag- 
nan squeaked. 

“He is at present dangling over 
a crevasse of awesome depth by a 
single strand of rope. Diplomat mus- 
cles appear unequal to the task of 
drawing him up.” 

There was a rending crunch from 
a shop across the plaza as a barred 
door collapsed under the impact (rf 
a power ram. Swarms of Groaci 
were systematically looting the stalls 
already opened, loading foodstuffs, 
glassware and other merchandise 
into wheeled vehicles. 

“This is wholesale hijackery!” 
Magnan yelped. “Open pillage! 
Highway robbery! You can’t do this 
without a license!” 

“Curb your tongue, sir!” Fiss 
hissed. “I shall for a while indulge 
your arrogant preemption of Groaci 
property out of sentimental respect 
for the niceties of diplomatic usage, 
but I shall tolerate no insults!” 

“Threats, Mr. Fiss?” Magnan 
choked. 

“Call it what you will. Soft One,” 
Fiss said. “When you are ready to

If 




acquiesce, send your word to me. 
Meantime, leave this building at 
your peril!”

D usk had fallen. The sounds of 
shattering locks and maneuv- 
ering vehicles continued in the 
streets outside. 

Beyond the window, booted Groa- 
ci peace-keepers paced monotonous- 
ly, heavy blast guns at the ready. 
Now and then, in a momentary lull, 
the sound of Yalcan voices raised in 
song could be heard from the bog, 
where torches flared, reflecting from 
the mirror-dark waters. The two 
lesser moons were high in the sky 
in their slow orbits; the third had 
risen above the horizon and cast 
purple shadows across the floor of 
the silent Legation office. 

‘‘It’s nearly dark,” Magnan mut- 
tered. “Retief, perhaps I’d better 
accompany you. Fiss may change 
his mind and batter the door down.” 
“He could come in through the 
window any time he decided to,” 
Retief said. “He’s nicely bluffed for 
the present, Mr. Magnan. And 
someone has to stay here to main- 
tain occupancy of Ae Legation.” 
“On second thought, I’m chang- 
ing my instructions,” Magnan said 
decisively. “You’d better not go. 
After all, if Minister Barnshingle 
wishes to recognize the coup, I see 
no reason — ” 

“I don’t think the Minister will 
be reasoning at his most lucidT level 
while dangling over a precipice. And 
there’s also Miss Braswell to con- 
sider. She’s out there somewhere.” 



“Retief, you can’t hope to find 
her without being apprehended! The 
city is swarming with armed Groa- 
ci!” 

“I think I know the back streets 
better than they do. I’ll stay out of 
sight. If I can reach Barnshingle 
before he signs anything, it may save 
a lot of embarrassment all around.” 
“Retief, as Charge — ” 

“Don’t give me any instructions 
I can’t follow, Mr. Magnan,” Retief 
took a hand-light from a desk draw- 
er, clipped it to his belt. “Just lie 
low and ignore whatever Fiss says 
to you. I’ll be back in a few hours.” 

R etief stepped from a doorless 
opening into the shadows of a 
narrow alley running behind the 
Legation. He waited until a knob- 
kneed Groaci in an elaborate helmet 
had strolled past the lighted inter- 
section fifty feet distant, then jump- 
ed, pulled himself up onto the low, 
tiled roof of the adjacent building. 
In the light of the rising fourth 
moon, he moved quietly to the far 
side, lay flat looking down on a side 
street littered with items discarded 
by the looters. 

One or two windows showed 
lights. A single armed Groaci stood 
under a corner street-lamp. Silently 
Retief worked his way along the 
roofs, jumping gaps between build- 
ings, until he reached a narrow space 
leading back into darkness a few 
yards from the corner. He groped, 
found a chip of broken tile, tossed 
it down into the alley. 

The Groaci cocked his eyes alert- 
ly, swung his gun around and came 
over to investigate, Retief tossed

down' another pebble; as the sentry 
entered the dark way, Retief drop- 
ped behind him, yanked him back- 
ward off his feet and caught the 
falling gun. He put the muzzle 
against the Grocai’s pulsating throat 
sac. 

‘Tell me where the Terry female 
is being held,” he growled, “and 
maybe I won’t tie knots in your eye- 
stalks.” 

“liiikkk!” the Groaci said. “To 
unhand me, demonic one!” 

“Of course, you may not know,” 
Retief said. “In that case I’d have to 
regretfully kill you and strike up a 
new acquaintance, which would be 
a nuisance for both of us.” 

“The impropriety of assaulting 
an innocent tourist! To lodge a com- 
plaint with the Travellers Aid So- 
ciety!” 

“No, that was this morning,” Re- 
tief corrected his prisoner. “This 
afternoon you’re a peaceful home- 
steader. You can think of me as an 
unpacified aborigine, if it will help 
any.” He jabbed with the gun. 
“Make up your mind. I’m on a 
tight schedule.” 

“The ghastliness of your fate,” 
the Groaci hissed. 

“Well, I have to hurry along,” 
Retief said. “Pardon my thumbs; 
shooting is such a messy business, 
and noisy, too.” 

“To restrain yourself, prowler in 
the night! To show you the way to 
the Soft She — and to savor the 
moment when you writhe on the 
hooks!” 

“That’s right,” Retief said agree- 
ably. “Think about something cheer- 
ful.” He prodded the captive guard 




THE CASTLE OF LIGHT

to his feet. “In the meantime — ” 
he switched to Groaci — “to play 
your cards right and maybe to live 
to see the dawn.” 

I n a shadowy arcade running be- 
side a rare two-story structure, 
Relief studied the dark windows in 
the wall opposite. Faint light gleam- 
ed behind two of the glassless open- 
ings. 

“Fll have to leave you here, I’m 
afraid, Tish,” Relief said softly. “I’ll 
just pop you into one of these con- 
venient garbage storage units. They 
have nicely fitted airtight doors, but 
you’ll be all right for an hour or so. 
If your information is accurate, 
with luck ril be back in plenty of 
time to let you out before you suf- 
focate. Of course, if anything hap- 
pens to delay me — well, that’s just 
the little risk we have to run, eh?” 
“To ... to try the rear window 
first,” Tish whispered. 

“Whatever you say.” Relief open- 
ed the door to the refuse bin and 
urged the Groaci inside. The alien 
clinched his olfactory sphincters 
tight and perched disconsolately on 
a heap of fruit rinds, locust cara- 
paces and pottery shards, his head 
ducked under the low ceiling. 

“To remember this trusting one,” 
he said shakily. “To carefully avoid 
being killed before returning to re- 
lease me.”‘ 

“With a motivation like that. I’m 
sure to survive.” Retief clamped the 
door shut, looked both ways, and 
darted across the street. 

The wall tiles were deeply incised 
with decorative floral motifs. He 
found finger and todiolds, climbed 



quickly to the level of the windows, 
eased through into a dark room. He 
paused to listen; there were faint 
Groaci voices ^^mewhere. In the 
dim-lit hall, they were more dis- 
tinct. He moved silently along to 
the nearest room. The door opened 
at a touch. 

Miss Braswell jumped up from a 
long, low Yalcan couch, her mouth 
open for a scream, cut off as she 
recognized Retief in the gloom. 

«Why — Mr. Retief I” 

“Shhh.” He crossed to her. A 
length of rope was tied firmly to 
her ankle and looped around a mas- 
sive clay sculpture. She was bare- 
footed, and her brown hair was in 
a state of mild disarray; there was a 
streak of dirt along one cheek. 

“What in the world is it all 
about?” she whispered. “I was just 
about to buy the darlingest hand- 
decorated chamber pot when all of 
a sudden a whole bunch of these 
nasty little creatures popped out 
of nowhere waving their eyes at me.” 

“How many are in the buildii\g 
now?” Retief attacked the heavy 
knots in the rope. 

“Heavens, I have no idea. It’s 
been pretty quiet for the last hour.” 
She giggled. “That tickles. I tried to 
untie it, but I only broke a finger- 
nail.” 

The knot yielded and Retief toss- 
ed the rope aside. 

“Do you feel equal to a short 
climb?” 

Miss Braswell came close to Re- 
tief. “Whatever you say, Mr. Re- 
tief,” she murmured. 

“Where are your shoes?” 

“I kept kicking them when they

IF 




were tying me up, so they took them. 
UghI Those creepy, damp hands!” 
“If we should get separated, head 
for the Legation. Mr. Magnan is 
holding the fort.” 

“You mean — these awful little 
Groaci are there, too?” 

“Haven’t you heard? They’re col- 
onizing the place.” 

“Why, the nerve!” 

'T^ere was a sudden hiss of near- 
A by voices. Relief flattened him- 
self against the wall just inside the 
door. Miss Braswell whirled and sat 
on the chaise-longue. There was the 
soft clap of Groaci feet. A small 
figure stepped into the room. 

“Ah, young woman,” a soft Groa- 
ci voice hissed. “Time to be going 
along.” 

“Where?” the girl demanded loud- 
ly* 

“To more comfortable quarters 
in more attractive surroundings.” 
“If it wasn’t so ridiculous, I’d 
think you were on the make, you 
sticky little monster. Keep away 
from me!” 

“You mammals are all alike,” the 
Groaci whispered. “But it’s pointless 
to flaunt those ugly objects at me, 
my girl.” Two more Groaci had 
followed the first, who signalled. 
“To make fast its arms,” he snap- 
ped. “To mind its talons — ” 

Miss Braswell jumped up and 
swung an open-'handed slap that sent 
the flimsy alien reeling back; Relief 
stepped quickly behind the other 
two, cracked their heads together 
sharply, thrust them aside and chop- 
ped a hand across the leader’s neck. 
“Time to go,” he breathed. At 



the window, he glanced out, then 
swung a leg over the sill. “It’s easy; 
just hang on with your toes.” 

Miss Braswell giggled again. “It’s 
so sort of sexy, being barefooted, 
isn’t it?” 

“That depends on what’s attach- 
ed to the feet,” Relief said. “Hurry 
up, now. We’re in enemy territory.” 

“Mr. Relief,” she said from 
above, “Do you think I flaunt my 
ah . .” 

“Certainly not. Miss Braswell. 
They flaunt themselves.” 

There was a sudden drumming 
from the shadows of the arcade 
across the way. 

“It just occurred to my friend 
Tish to use a little initiative,” Retief 
called softly. He dropped to the 
street a few feet below. “Jump — I’ll 
catch you.” 

The thumping continued. Miss 
Braswell squealed and let go, slam- 
med agaihst Relief’s chest. He set 
her on her feet. “The Groaci have 
good ears. Come on!” They dashed 
for the nearest dark alley as a squad 
of armed Groaci Peace-keepers 
rounded a corner. There was a weak 
shout, a clatter of accoutrements as 
the four aliens broke into a run. 
Gripping Miss Braswell’s hand, Re- 
tief dashed along the narrow way. 
Ahead, a wall loomed, blocking the 
passage. They skidded to a halt, 
turned to face the oncoming pur- 
suers. 

“Get to the roof,” Retief snap- 
ped. “I’ll slow them down!” 

Between Retief and the Groaci, 
a six foot long grating set in the 
pavement suddenly dropped open 
with a dank of metal. The leading

Groaci, coming on at a smart clip, 
plunged over the edge, followed an 
instant later by the second. Relief 
brought his light up, shone it in the 
eyes of the other two as the third 
runner reached the pitfall, dropped 
from sight. As the last of the four 
faltered, sensing something amiss, 
the long, sinuous form of a Yalcan 
native glided from a door set in 
the wall, gave the Groaci a hearty 
push, dusted both sets of hands, and 
inclined its head in a gracious nod. 

4 4 A h, Retief-Tic — and Braswell- 
Ticcim! What jolly surprise! 
Please do honor to enter humble 
abode for refreshing snort before 
continuing!” 

‘‘Nice timing, Oo-Plif,” Retief 
said. “I thought you’d be off to the 
festival by now.” 

The Yalcan reached inside the 
door, fumbled. The grating swung 
back in place. “I was busy with brisk 
trade when Five-eyes arrive,” he ex- 
plained. “Decide stick around to 
keep eye on store. Plenty time make 
scene at bog yet.” 

Miss Braswell shuddered as she 
crossed the grate. “What’s down 
there?” 

“Only good honest sewage, nice 
change for Five-eyes. After brisk 
swim, fetch up in bog, join in merry- 
making.” 

“I thought you Yalcans were pa- 
cifists,” Retief commented, stepping 
inside a roughly finished passage 
running parallel with the outer wall 
of the building. 

“All Yalcan love peace. More 
peaceful now noisy Five-eyes enjoy- 
ing swim. Besides, only open drain 



cover; Visitors dive in of own free 
will.” 

“I had the impression you helped 
that last fellow along.” 

“Always try to be helpful when 
possible. Listen, you want to talk, or 
want snort?” 

They followed Oo-Plif along in- 
terior passages to emerge behind the 
bar of the darkened dram-shop, 
took seats at a low bench and ac- 
cepted elaborate glasses of aromatic 
liquor. 

“Oo-Plif, I’d appreciate it if you’d 
see Miss Braswell back to the Lega- 
tion,” Retief said. “I have to leave 
town on an urgent errand.” 

“Better stay close, Retief-Tic. 
Come along to bog in time for high 
point of Voom festiyal. Only couple 
hours now.” 

“I have an errand to run first, 
Oo-Plif. I’ve been delegated to find 
Minister Barnshingle and notify him 
that the Legation’s under siege and 
that he shouldn’t sign anything with- 
out reading the fine print.” 

“Barnshingle-Tic-Tic? Skinny Ter- 
ran with receding lower mandible 
and abdomen like queen ripe with 
eggs?” 

“Graphically put, Oo-Plif. He’s 
supposed to be hanging around a 
mountain somewhere, if the Groaci 
haven't yet swooped down to the 
rescue.” 

Oo-Plif was wobbling his head, 
now enameled in orange and green 
holiday colors, in the Yalcan gesture 
of affirmation. 

“Barnshingle-Tic-Tic here in city 
at present moment. Arrive half- 
hour ago amid heavy escort of Five- 

^es.”

IF 




“Hmmm. That simplifies matters, 
perhaps. I was expecting to have to 
steal a Groaci heli and hunt him 
down in the wilds. Did he seem to 
be a prisoner, Oo-Plif?** 

‘‘Hard to say, not get too good 
look. Busy helping Five-eyes find 
way to bog.” 

“Via the sewer, I take it?” 
“Sure; plenty gratings round town. 
Must be fifty Five-eyes in swim now; 
plenty company.” 

“Are you sure they can swim?” 
“Details, details,” Oo-Plif said 
soothingly. “You want to go now, 
pay visit to Barnshingle-Tic-Tic?” 
“As soon as Miss Braswell’s taken 
care of.” 

“I’m going with you,” the girl 
said quickly. “I wouldn’t dream of 
missing the excitement.” 

V 

ii'T^his system of hidden pas- 
A sages is certainly handy,” Re- 
lief said. “How much farther?” 
“Close now. Not really hidden 
passages; just space in double walls. 
Yalcan like build plenty strong.” 
They emerged into another of the 
innumerable alleys that characteriz- 
ed the town, crossed it, entered an- 
other door. Oo-Plif cautioned sil- 
ence. “Place swarm with Five-eyes. 
We sneak up and get lie of land, 
find way of rescue Barnshingle-Tic- 
Tic from rescuers.” 

Five minutes later, crowded into 
a narrow, dusty passage in the heart 
of the sprawling building. Relief 
heard the booming tones of Barn- 
shingle’s voice nearby, and the 
breathy reply of a Groaci. 



“Opening in back of closet just 
ahead,” Oo-Plif whispered. “Get ear- 
ful of proceedings there.” 

Relief edged forward. Through 
the half-open closet door he caught 
a glimpse of Minister Barnshingle 
seated awkwardly in a low Yalcan 
easy chair, dressed in dusty hikin’^ 
clothes. Half a dozen Groaci in vari- 
colored mufti surrounded him. 

“ — an exceedingly hairy experi- 
ence, to be sure,” Barnshingle was 
saying. “Most gratifying to see your 
heli appear. Drone-master Fiss. But 
I don’t quite grasp the import of the 
present situation. Not that I’m sug- 
gesting that I’m being held against 
my will, you understand, but I really 
must hurry back to my office.” 
“No need for haste, Mr. Minis- 
ter,” Fiss reassured him. “Every- 
thing has been conducted with 
scrupulous regard for legality, I as- 
sure you.” 

“But there seemed to be hundreds 
of your . , ah . esteemed com- 
patriots about in the streets,” Barn- 
shingle pressed on. “And I had the 
distinct impression that there were 
a number of highly irregular acti- 
vities in progress.” 

“You refer perhaps to the efforts 
of some of our people to remove 
certain obstacles?” 

“Breaking down doors, to be pre- 
cise,” Barnshingle said a trifle snap- 
pishly. “As well as hauling away 
wagon-loads of merchandise from 
shops the owners of which appeared 
to be absent.” 

“Ah, yes, impulse buying. Hardly 
consonant with domestic thrift. But 
enough of this delightful gossip, Mr. 
Minister. The matter I wished to

21 




discuss with you . Fiss gave the 
Minister a glowing account of his 
peaceful takeover, citing chapter and 
verse each time the astounded diplo- 
mat attempted to rumble a protest. 

‘‘And, of course,” he finished, “I 
wished to acquaint your Excellency 
with the facts before permitting you 
to be subjected to ill-advised counsel 
by hot-heads.” 

“B-but, great heavens. Drone- 
master — ” 

“Planetary Coordinator Pro Tern/* 
Fiss interjected smoothly. “Now, I 
shall, of course, be happy to inspect 
your credentials at once in order to 
regularize relations between the 
Corps and my government.” 

4 4TVyTy credentials? But I’ve pre- 

J“^Asented my credentials to 
Mr. Rillikuk of the Foreign Office!” 

“This is hardly the time to remi- 
nisce over vanished regimes, Mr. 
Minister. Now — ” Fiss leaned for- 
ward confidentially — “you and I 
are, if I may employ the term, men 
of the world. Not for us the fruit- 
less expense of emotional energy 
over the fait accompli, eh? As for 
myself, I am most eager to show 
you around my offices in the finest 
of the towers of my capital.” 

“Towers? Capital?” 

“The attractive edifices just be- 
yond the swampy area where the 
local wildlife are now disporting 
themselves,” Fiss explained. “I have 
assigned — ” 

“You’ve violated the native Sanc- 
tum Sanctorum?” Barnshingle gasp- 
ed. 

“An unfortunate choice of words,” 
Fiss hissed. “Would you have me 



establish my ministries here in this 
warren of huts?” 

“The Yalcans — ” Barnshingle 

said weakly. 

“The name of the planet is now 
Grudlu,” Fiss stated. “In honor of 
Grud, the patron Muse of practi- 
cality.” 

“Look here, Fiss! Are you asking 
me to turn my back on the Yalcans 
and recognize you as the de jure 
government here? Simply on the 
basis of this absurd legalistic ration- 
alization of yours?” 

“With the exception of a number 
of slanted adjectives, very succinctly 
put,” Fiss whispered. 

“Why in the world would I do a 
dastardly thing like that?” Barn- 
shingle demanded. 

“Why, good for him,” Miss Bras- 
well breathed behind Retief. 

“Ah, yes, terms,” Fiss said com- 
fortably. “First, your mission would, 
of course, be raised at once to Em- 
bassy level, at Grudlun insistence, 
with yourself requested by name as 
Ambassador, naturally. Secondly, I 
have in mind certain local commer- 
cial properties which might make 
a valuable addition to your portfolio. 
I can let you in at investor’s prices. 
The entire transaction to be con- 
ducted with the utmost discretion, of 
course, so as not to arouse comment 
among the coarse-minded. Then, of 
course, you’ll wish to select a hand- 
some penthouse for yourself in one

ters in this kennel,” Fiss comment- 
ed. “Why a person could disappear 
in this maze of old crockery and 
never be heard from again.” 
“Disappear?” Barnshingle croak- 
ed. “And vvha — what if I refuse?” 

4 4 TJ efuse? Please, Mr. Minister 
— or more properly, Mr. 
Ambassador — why release the fowl 
of fancy to flutter among such mor- 
bid trees of speculation?” 

“What about my staff? Will — ” 
“Suitable bribes will be offered,” 
Fiss whispered crisply. “Pray don’t 
give it another thought. All sur- 
viving members of the Mission will 
present a united front — with the ex- 
ception of the two criminals now 
sulking in the former Legation, of 
course,” he added. 

“Magnan? Why, he’s one of my 
most reliable men!” 

“Perhaps something could be 
managed in the case of Mr. Mag- 
nan, since you express an interest. 
As for the other — he will return 
to Groac to stand trial for assorted 
crimes against the peace and digni- 
ty of the Groacian state.” 

“I really must protest — ” Barn- 
shingle said weakly. 

“Your Excellency's loyalty is most 
touching. And now, if you’d just 
care to sign here.” An underling 
handed Fiss a document which he 
passed to Barnshingle. 

“Why, the old phoney!” Miss 
Braswell gasped. “He’s going to do 
it!” 

“It’s time to break this up,” Re- 
lief whispered to Oo-Plif. “I’ll take 
care of Fiss;. you hit the others.” 



“On contrary, Retief-Tic,” tho 
Yalcan replied. “Most improper to 
interfere with natural course of 
events.” 

“Maybe you don't understand; 
Barnshingle’s about to sign away 
your rights to Yale. By the time you 
drag it through the courts and re- 
cover, you may all be dead. The 
Groaci are zealous in the. field of 
wildlife control.” 

“No matter. We Yalcans pacifis- 
tic folk. Not like butt in,” Oo-Plif 
said quietly. 

“In that case. I’ll have to do it 
alone. You’ll take care of Miss Bras- 
well — ” 

“No, not even alone, dear Retief- 
Tic. Not in spirit of Yalcan Pacif- 
ism.” Something hard prodded Re- 
lief’s chest; he looked down at the 
power gun in Oo-PIifs lower right 
hand. 

“Why, you old stinker,” Miss 
Braswell said. “And I thought you 
were sweet!” 

“Hope soon to recoup good opin- 
ion, Braswell-Ticcim,” Oo-Plif said. 
“Now silence, please.” 

In the room, Barnshingle and Fiss 
were making congratulatory noises 
at each other. 

“Matter of fact,” Barnshingle said, 
“I never felt these Yalcans were 
ready for self-government. I’m sure 
your wardship will be just what they 
need.” 

“Please — no meddling in inter- 
nal affairs,” Fiss said. “And now let 
us away to more appropriate sur- 
roundings. Just wait until you see 
the view from your new suite, Mr. 
Ambassador . .” They departed, 
chattering.

you’ve had your way, 
VV Oo-Plif,” Relief said. “Your 
pacifism has a curiously spotty qual- 
ity. Just why do you object to pre- 
venting our unfortunate Minister 
from making an idiot of himself?” 
“Forgive use of weapon, Retief- 
Tic. Foolishness of Barnshingle 
Tic-Tic-Tic not important.” 

“He’s a three-tic man now?” 
“Promotion just received at hands 
of Five-eyes. Now away to bog, all 
buddies together, eh?” 

“Where’s the rest of Barnshingle’s 
staff? They were together on the 
crater-viewing expedition?” 

“All tucked away in house few 
alleys from here. Better get wiggle 
on now. Climax of festival arrive 
soon.” 

“Good night, does your silly old 
carnival mean more to you than 
your own planet?” Miss Braswell de- 
manded. 

“Voom festival of great national 
importance,” Oo-Plif stated, opening 
and closing his bony mandibles like 
the two halves of a clam — a man- 
nerism indicating polite amusement. 

Following the Yalcan’s instruc- 
tions, Relief squeezed through nar- 
row passages, found his way out 
into the inevitable dark alley. Miss 
Braswell’s hand holding tightly to 
his. The sounds of looters and their 
vehicles had diminished to near- 
silence now. A turbine growled along 
a nearby street, going away. They 
came out into a side street, surveyed 
the deserted pavement, the scattered 
discards of the Groaci homesteaders. 
Above the low roof-lines, the mile- 
distant towers of the shrine were a 
blaze of gorgeous light. 



“It looks so pretty, all lit up,” 
Miss Braswell said. “I’m just amazed 
that you’d let those nasty little Groa- 
ci walk in and take it all away from 
you.” 

Oo-Plif laughed, a sound like 
sand in a bearing. “Towers tributes 
to deities. Fate of towers in deities’ 
hands now.” 

“Hmmmph. They could have used 
a little help from you,” Miss Bras- 
well sniffed. 

“Looks like the new owners have 
cleared out for now,” Relief said. 
“All over at the towers, throwing a 
party in honor of Independence 
Day.” 

“Time go to dandy hot bog,” 
Oo-Plif said. “Big event soon now.” 
Moving briskly along the empty 
street under the light of the fourth 
moon, now high in the sky, they 
reached the corner. Down the wider 
cross-avenue, the flaring torches of 
the revelers at the bog sparkled 
cheerfully. The faint sound of Yal- 
can voices raised in song were audi- 
ble in the stillness. 

“Just what is this big event we’re 
hurrying to make?” Retlief enquired. 

Oo-Plif indicated the large sat- 
ellite overhead. “When number four 
moon reach position ten degrees 
west of zenith — Voom!” 

“Oh, astrological symbolism.” 
“Not know big word. Only one 
time every ninety-four years stand- 
ard all four moon line up. When 
this happen — Voom!” 

“Voom,” Relief said. “Just what 
does the word signify?” 

“Fine old Yalcan word,” Oo-Pliff 
said. “Terry equivalent . ummm

“Probably untraaslatable.” 

Oo-Plif snapped the fingers of his 
upper left hand. 

“I remember,’^ he said. “Mean 
‘earthquake’!” 

Relief stopped dead. 

“You did say — ‘earthquake’?” 
“Correct, Retief-Tic.” 

Relief’s left fist slammed out in 
a jack-hammer punch to the Yal- 
can’s midriff plates. The tall crea- 
ture ooffed, coiled into a ball, all 
four legs scrabbling, the four arms 
groping wildly. 

“Sorry, pal,” Retief muttered, 
catching up the power gun. “No 
time to argue.” He grabbed Miss 
Braswell’s hand and started off at 
a dead run down the deserted street 
toward the towering castle of light. 

VI 

T hey skidded to a halt at a gleam 
from an opening door ahead. A 
pipe stem-legged Groaci hurried 
from a building, a bulging sack over 
one knobby shoulder. A second hel- 
meted looter trotted behind, lugging 
a handsome ten-gallon spittoon. 

“They’ve got a heli,” Retief said 
softly. “We need it. Wait here.” 
Miss Braswell clutched his hand 
even tighter. “I’m scared!” 

The two scavengers were clamber- 
ing into their dark machine now. 
Running lights sprang into diamond 
brilliance. Turbos whirred. Retief 
disengaged his hand, ran across the 
thirty feet of open pavement and 
jumped, just as the heli lifted. There 
were faint, confused cries from the 
startled Groaci. One fumbled out 
a power rifle in time for Retief to 



jerk it from his grasp, toss it over 
the side. The heli canted wildly, 
narrowly missing a decorated cor- 
nice. Retief got a grip on a bony 
neck, propelled the owner over the 
side, heard a faint yelp as he hit. 
An instant later, the second follow- 
ed. Retief caught the controls, 
brought the heli around in a tight 
turn, dropped it in beside Miss Bras- 
well. 

“Oh! I was afraid it was you 
that fell overboard, Mr. Retief!” 
She scrambled up beside him, lent 
a hand to tumble the gaboon out 
to smash thunderously on the tiles. 
On a nearby roof, the two disposs- 
essed Groaci keened softly, like lost 
kittens. The heli jumped off, lifted 
swiftly past them and headed for 
the glass towers. 

T he city of glass spread over forty 
acres, a crystalline fantasy of 
towers, minarets, fragile balconies 
suspended over space, diaphanous 
fretwork, airy walkways spun like 
spiderwebs between slim spires 
ablaze with jewel-colored light. Re- 
tief brought the heli in high, settled 
in a stomach-lifting swoop toward 
the tallest of the towers. 

“Miss Braswell, you can operate 
this thing, can’t you?” 

“Sure, I’m a good driver, but — 
Retief threw the drive into auto- 
hover three feet above a tiny terrace 
clinging to the spire. “Wait here. I’ll 
be back as soon as I can. If any- 
body else shows up, get out of here 
fast and head for the bog!” 

“The ... the bog?” 

“It’s the safest place around when 
the quake hits!” He was over the

ed, spluttered, jerked free. His face 
had turned an unflattering shade of 
purple. 

“What’s the meaning of this out- 
burst?” 

“Sorry, Mr. Minister.” Relief 
slammed a clean right cross to Barn- 
shingle’s jaw, caught the diplomat as 
he folded, stooped to hoist the 
weight to his shoulders, and ran for 
the door. 

Suddenly Groaci were every- 
where. Two bounced aside from Re- 
lief’s rush; another ducked, swung 
a power gun up, fired just as Fiss 
leaped in and knocked his hand 
aside. 

“To endanger the bloated one,” 
he hissed — and went over back- 
wards as Relief slammed him aside. 
A helmeted Groaci Peace-keeper 
tackled Relief from behind; he paus- 
ed to kick him across the room, 
bowling over others. A blaster bolt 
bubbled glass above his head. The 
air hissed with weak Groaci shouts 
as Relief plunged down stairs. Be- 
hind him, there was a terrific crash; 
over his shoulder he caught a glimpse 
of glass chips showering from a fall- 
en chandelier. He was at the bridge 
now; Barnshingle groaned and flap- 
ped his arms feebly. Relief stepped 
onto the narrow span, felt it sway 
under his weight. He took two steps, 
put a foot over the edge, teetered — 

There was a crystalline tinkle, and 
a ten-foot spear of canary-yellow 
glass fell past him. He caught his 
balance, took another step, wobbled 
as the bridge quivered, leaped clear 
as the glass shattered into ten thou- 
sand glittering shards that sparkled 
as they fell. 



H e went up stairs three at a time. 

A sudden lurch threw him 
against the wall, where mosaic glass 
figures depicted glass blowers at 
work. A huge chunk of the scene 
fell backwards, letting in a gust of 
cool night air. Relief scrambled for 
footing, went up, felt a glass slab 
drop from underfoot as he gained 
the terrace. Wind beat down from 
the heli, hovering a few yards dis- 
tant. The sparkling tower that had 
loomed nearby was gone. A sus- 
tained crashing, as of nearby surf, 
drowned the heli’s turbos. 

Relief lowered Barnshingle, now 
pawing weakly and blinking vague 
eyes, half lifted, half shoved him 
into the rear seat. 

“Hurry, Mr. Relief! It’s going!” 
The noise was deafening now. Re- 
lief grasped a strut to pull himself 
up, and suddenly he was hanging by 
one hand, his feet treading air. The 
heli surged, lifting. He looked down. 
The tower was dropping away be- 
low, a cloud of vari-colored glass 
splinters puffing out as the upper 
stories thundered down into the 
depths. A slender sapphire spire, 
thrusting up almost alone now, rip- 
pled like a dancer, then broke into 
three major fragments and dropped 
gracefully from view. Relief hauled 
himself up, got a foot inside the 
heli, pulled himself into the seat. 

“Mr. Relief, you’re bleeding.” He 
put a hand up, felt slickness across 
his cheek. 

“A lot of splinters flying around. 
It was a little too close — ” 

“Mr. Relief!” Miss Braswell work- 
ed frantically at the controls. “We’re 
losing altitude!” 



TBE CASTLE OF LIGHT

There was a harsh droning noise. 
Retief looked back. A heavy armor- 
ed heli with Groaci markings was 
dropping toward theni. 

“Make for the bog!” Retief call- 
ed over the racket. 

There was a buzz, and garish 
light glared across the struts above 
Relief’s head, bubbling paint. 

“Hang on!” Miss Braswell shout- 
ed. “Evasive action!” The heli tilt- 
ed, whipped up in the opposite di- 
rection, spun, dropped like a stone, 
darted ahead. The futile buzzing of 
the Groaci’s blaster rattled around 
the faltering vehicle. 

“Can’t do much more of that,” 
Miss Braswell gasped. “Losing alti- 
tude too fast.” 

A vast, dark shadow flitted over- 
head. 

“We’re sunk,” Miss Braswell 
squeaked. “Another one — ” 

There was a flare of actinic blue 
from above and behind, followed 
by a muffled clatter. Retief caught 
a glimpse of the Groaci heli, its 
rotors vibrating wildly, falling away 
behind them. Something huge and 
shadowy swept toward them from 
the rear in a rising whistle of air. 

“Get set,” Retief called. He 
brought up the blaster he had taken 
from Oo-Plif, steadied his hand 
against the heli — 

The shadow dropped close; the 
running lights’ of the heli gleamed 
on thirty-foot canopies of translucent 
tracery spread wide above a seven- 
foot body. Oo-Plif’s gaily painted 
face beamed down at them. He 
floated on spread wings, arms and 
legs folded close. 

“Ah. Retief-Tic! Punch in thorax 



hasten metamorphis. Got clear of 
chrysalis just in time!” 

“Oo-Plif!” Retief yelled. “What 
are you doing here?” 

“Follow to warn you, dear bud- 
dy! Not want you to meet gods in 
lousy company like crowd of Five- 
eyes! Now on to bog for festivities!” 
Below, the torch-lit surface of the 
swamp rushed up. Miss Braswell 
braked, threw herself into Retief’s 
arms as the battered heli struck with 
a massive splatter at the edge of the 
mud. Painted Yalcan faces bobbed 
all around. 

“Welcome, strangers!” voices call- 
ed. “Just in time for fun!” 

VII 

B arnshingle was groaning, holding 
his head. 

“What am I doing here, hip-deep 
in mud?” he demanded. “Where’s 
Magnan? What happened to that 
fellow Fiss?” 

“Mr. Magnan is coming now,” 
Miss Braswell said. “You bumped 
your head.” 

“Bumped my head? I seem to re- 
call — ” 

Someone floundered up, gasping 
and waving skinny, mud-caked arms. 

“Mr. Minister! These primitives 
dragged me bodily from the street!” 
“I thought you were going to stay 
inside the Legation,” Retief said. 

“I was merely conducting a ne- 
gotiation,” Magnan huffed. “What 
are you doing here, Retief — and 
Miss Braswell!” 

“What were you negotiating for? 
A private apartment just below the 
Ambassadorial penthouse?”

“Wha — whatever’s happened?” 
Barnshingle burst out. “Where’s the 
shrine gone?” He stared across at 
the glowing heap that marked the 
site of the fallen towers. 

“It seems to have — ah — been 
offered to the local deities,” Magnan 
said. “It seems to be the custom.” 
“And all those nasty little bug- 
eyes with it,” Miss Braswell put in. 

“Really, Miss Braswell! 1 must 
ask you to avoid the use of racial 
epithets!” 

“It’s really too bad about the tow- 
ers; they were awfully pretty.” 
Oo-Plif, perched like a vast moth 
on a nearby tree-fern spoke up. “Is 
okay. Re-use glass. Make plenty 
bowl and pot from fragments.” 
“But — what about all those 
Groaci mixed in with the pieces?” 
“Impurities make dandy colors,” 
Oo-Plif assured her. 

“My jaw,” Barnshingle grated. 
“How did I fall and hit my jaw?” 
“Retief-Tic arrive in nick of time 
to snatch you from sacrificial pile. 
Probably bump chin in process.” 
“What in the world were you 
doing there, Mr. Minister?” Magnan 
gasped. “You might have been kill- 
ed.” 

“Why, ah, 1 was trepanned there 
by the Groaci. Quite against my 
will, of course. They . ah . had 
some fantastic proposal to make. 1 
was just on the point of daring them 
to do their worst when you appear- 
ed, Retief. After that, my recollec- 
tion grows a bit hazy.” 

44'"T^hese head-blows often have 
A retroactive effects,” Retief 
said. “I’ll wager you don’t recall a 



thing that was said from the time 
they picked you off that perilous 
mountain.” 

“Don’t remember? Why, 1 have 
perfect recall — ” 

“It’s even possible that Oo-Plif 
has forgotten some of the things he 
overheard — about penthouses and 
gilt-edge stocks.” Retief went on. 
“Maybe it was the excitement gener- 
ated by your announcement that 
Yale will be getting some large ship- 
ments of fine gray silica sand from^ 
Groac suitable for glass-making, 
courtesy of the CDT.” 

“Announcement?” Barnshingle 
gulped. 

“The one you’re going to make 
tomorrow,” Retief suggested very 
gently. 

“Oh . that one,” the Minister 
said weakly. 

“Time to go along now to next 
phase of celebration,” Oo-Plif called 
from his perch. 

“How jolly,” Magnan said. “Come 
along, Mr. Minister.” 

“Not you, Magnan-Tic, and Barn- 
shingle Tic-Tic,” Oo-Plif said. 
Mating rites no place for elderly 
drones. You scheduled for cosy roost 
in thorn-tree as ceremonial penitence 
for follies of youth.” 

“What about us?” Miss Braswell 
asked breathlessly. 

“Oh, time for you to get busy on 
youthful follies, so have something 
to repent later!” 

“You said . mating rite. Does 
that mean . .?”

MAD MAN 

by R. A. LAFFERTY 



He was the maddest man 
you ever saw. tn fact, 
that was his career! 



T he too-happy puppy came 
bounding up to him — a bun- 
dle of hysterical yipes and a wag- 
gling tail that would bring joy to 
the soul of anyone. The pathetic ex- 
pectation and sheer love in the shin- 
ing eyes and woolly rump was some- 
thing to see. The whole world loves 
a puppy like that. 

And George Gnevni kicked the 
thing end over end and high into the 
air with a remarkably powerful 
boot. The sound that came from the 
broken creature as it crash-landed 
against a wall was a heart-rending 
wail that would have melted the 
heart of a stone toad. 

Gnevni was disgusted with him- 
self. 

“Less than ten meters. Should 
have booted him twelve. Til kill the 



blood-sucking cod-headed little cur 
the next time. Nothing goes rigjit 
today.” 

I t was not a real puppy; it was 
better than a real one. There 
is something artificial in the joy and 
carrying on of a real puppy as well 
as in its hurt screaming. But the an- 
tics of this one rang true. The thing 
was made by a competent artist, and 
it was well made. It could be set to 
go through the same routine again 
at a moment’s notice. 

A Crippled Old Lady came up 
shaking with palsy. There was real 
beauty in her face yet, and a seren- 
ity that pain could never take away 
from her. 

“A glorious morning to you, my 
good man,” she said to Gnevni. 



30 



And he kicked her crutches out 
from under her. 

“I am sure that was an accident, 
sir,” she gasped as she teetered and 
nearly fell. “Would you be so kind 
as to hand them to me again? I’m 
quite unable to stand without them.” 

Gnevni knocked her down with a 
smacking blow. He then stomped up 
and down on her body from stem 
to stern. And with a heavy two-foot- 
ed jump on her stomach he left her 
writhing on the pavement. 

Gnevni was again disgusted with 
himself. 

“It doesn’t seem to do a thing for 
me today,” he said, “not a thing. I 
don’t know what’s the matter with 
me this morning.” 

It was a real lady. We are afraid 
of dog-lovers, but we are not afraid 
of people-lovers. There are so few 
of them. So the lady was not an 
artificial one. She was real flesh and 
blood, and the best of both. How- 
ever, she was neither crippled nor 
old. She was a remarkably athletic 
woman and had been a stunt girl 
before she found her true vocation. 
She was also a fine young actress 
and played the Crippled Old Lady 
role well. 

Gnevni went to his job in the 
Cortin Institute Building that was 
popularly known as the Milk Shed. 

“Bring my things, crow-bait,” he 
grumbled at a nice young lady as- 
sistant. “I see the rats have been in 
your hair again. Are you naturally 
deformed or do you stand that way 
on purpose? There’s a point, you 
know beyond which ugliness is no 
Icxnger a virtue.” 

The nice young lady began to 



cry, but not very convincingly. She 
went off to get Gnevni’s things. But 
she would bring only a part of them, 
and, not all of them the right ones. 

“Old George isn’t himself this 
morning,” said the under-doctor Co- 
trel of Gnevni. 

“I know,” said under-doctor Dev- 
on. “We’ll have to devise something 
to get him mad today. We can’t 
have him getting pleasant on us,” 

T he required paranexus could 
not be synthesized. Many sub- 
stances had been tried and all of 
them had been found insufficient. 
But the thing was needed for the 
finest operation of the Pro- 
grammeds. It had to be the real 
thing, and there was only one way 
to get a steady supply of it. 

At one time they had simplified 
it by emphasizing the cortin and 
adrenalin components of it. Later 
they had emphasized a dozen other 
components, and then a hundred. 
And finally they accepted it for 
what it was — too complex for du- 
plication, too necessary an accessory 
for the Programmeds to be neglect- 
ed, too valuable at its most effective 
to be taken from random specimens. 
It could be had only from humans, 
and it could be had in fine quality 
only from a special sort of humans. 
The thing was very complex, but at 
the Institute they called it Oil of 
Dog. 

Peredacha was a pleasant little 
contrivance — a “Shadier Move- 
ment” or “female” of the species that 
had once been called homo cori’^ 
ventus or robot and was now re- 
ferred to as “Programmed Person”. 



MAD AUN 



31 




She had a sound consciousness, 
hint of developing originality, a 
capacity for growth and a neatness 
of mechanism and person. She might 
be capable of fine work of the 
speculative sort. She was one of 
those on whom the added spark 
might not be wasted. 

Always they had worked to com- 
bine the best elements of both sorts. 

The Programmed Persons were 
in many respects superior to the Old 
Recension Persons or Humans. 
They were of better emotional bal- 
ance, of greater diligence, of wider 
adaptability, of much vaster mem- 
ory or accumufation and of readier 
judgment based on that memory. 
But there was one thing lacking in 
the most adept of the Programmed 
that was often to be found in the 
meanest of the Humans. This was a 
thing very hard to name. 

It was the little bit extra; but the 
Programmed already had the very 
much extra. It had something of the 
creative in it, though the Pro- 
grammed were surely more creative 
than the humans. It was the rising 
to the occasion; the Programmed 
could do this more gracefully, but 
sometimes less effectively, than 
could the humans. It was the break- 
ing out of a framework, the utter 
lack of complacency, the sudden 
surge of power or intellect, the be- 
wildering rriastery of the moment, 
the thing that made the difference. 

It was the Programmed them- 
selves who sought out the thing, for 
they were the more conscious of the 
difference. It was the Programmed 
technicians who set up the system. 
It cost the humans nothing, and it 



profited the Programmed very 
much in their persons and personal- 
ities. 

On many of them, of course, it 
had little effect; but on a select few 
it had the effect of raising them to 
a genius grade. And many of them 
who could never become geniuses 
did become specialists to a degree 
unheard of before — and all be- 
cause of the peculiar human addi- 
tive. 

It was something like the cross- 
ing of the two races, though there 
could never be a true cross of spe- 
cies so different — one of them not 
being of the reproductive sort. The 
adrenal complex sometimes worked 
great changes on a Programmed. 

There were but a few consistent 
prime sources of it — and each of 
them somehow had his distinguish- 
ing mark. Often a Programmed felt 
an immediate kinship, seldom re- 
ciprocated, with the Human donor. 
And Peredacha, a very responsive 
Programmed, felt the kinship keen- 
ly when the additive was given to 
her. 

“I claim for paternity,” she cried. 
It was a standard joke of the Pro- 
grammed. ‘T claim as daughter to 
my donor! I never believed it be- 
fore. I thought it only one of those 
things that everybody says. The do- 
nors are such a surly bunch that it 
drives them really violent if one of 
us seeks their acquaintence on thi* 
pretext. But Fm curious. Which one 
was it?” 

She was told. 

“Oh no! Not him of the whole 
clutch! How droll can you get? He 
is my new kindred? But never be-

fore did I feel so glorious. Never 
have I been able to work so well.” 

T he assigned job of George 
Gnevni was a mechanical one. 
In the ordinary course of things this 
would be all wrong, for George had 
less mechanical aptitude than any 
man ever born. George had very 
little aptitude for anything at all in 
the world — until his one peculiar 
talent was discovered. 

He was an unhandsome and 
graceless man, and he lived in pov- 
erty. Much has been said about the 
compensations of physical ugliness 
— mostly the same things that 
have been said about poverty. It is 
often maintained that they may be 
melded behind the dross front, that 
the sterling character may develop 
and shine through the adversity. 

It is lies, it is lies! It happens only 
rarely that these things are enob- 
ling. With persons of the commoner 
sort it happens not at all. To be 
ugly and clumsy and poor at the 
same time will finally drive a man 
to raving anger against the whole 
world. 

And that was the idea. 

Gnevni was assigned a mean lodg- 
ing, and his meal tickets were pe- 
culiar ones. He could not obtain 
what he wanted to eat. He could 
have only what was on the list for 
him to eat, and this was evilly con- 
trived to cover everything that dis- 
agreed with him. As a result he was 
usually in gastric pain and in seeth- 
ing anger at his own entrails. He 
had an ugly nature to begin with, 
but the form of life forced upoo 
him deepened and nurtured it. 



Gnevni’s voice was harsh and 
jangling, though there was real mas- 
tery of resonance in his powerful 
howling when his anger reached 
high form. He was denied wifing 
privileges, and no woman would 
have had him in any case. He was 
allowed just enough of bad whoa- 
johnny whisky to keep him edgy 
and mean, but not enought to bring 
him solace. 

He was an oaf — an obscene dis- 
tasteful clod of humanity. He Knew 
it and he boiled and seethed with 
the shoddy knowledge. He was no 
better than a badger in a cage, but 
those things are terrific snappers. 

For his poor livelihood he was 
given a quota of mechanical tasks 
to complete every day, and he had 
no mechanical aptitude at all. They 
were simple assembly jobs. A com- 
petent Programmed Person could 
do in minutes what it took Gnevni 
all day to do. Most children of the 
human species could do the same 
things easily and quickly — though 
some might not be able to do them 
at all, for the Humans are less uni- 
form in their abilities than the Pro- 
grammed. 

The things that Gnevni was to as- 
semble were never all there, some 
of them were the wrong things, and 
some of them were defective. A 
Programmed would have spotted 
the off stuff at once and sent it 
back, but ugly George had no way 
of telling whether things were right 
or not. He sweated and swore his 
days away at the grotesque labor 
and became the angriest man alive. 

Joker tools were sometimes sub- 
stituted on him for the true tools 



MAD MAN

— screwdrivers with shafts as flex- 
ible as spaghetti, key-drifts with 
noses as soft as wax, box-end wrench 
sets that were sized to fit nothing, 
soldering guns that froze ice on 
their tips, mis-marked calipers with 
automatic slippage, false templates, 
unworkable crimpers, continuity 
testers that shocked a man to near 
madness. 

It is a legend that humans have 
an affinity for mechanical things. 
But normal humans have an innate 
hatred for machinery, and the ac- 
comodation that has grown up be- 
tween them is a nervous one. The 
damned stuff just doesn’t work right. 
You hate it, and it hates you. That’s 
the old basic of it. 

Swift, a wise old mad man, once 
wrote a piece on the “Perversity of 
Inanimate Objects”. And they are 
perverse, particularly to a sick, ugly 
ignorant, incompetent, poor man 
who fights them in a frenzy — and 
they fight back. 

All day long George Gnevni and a 
few of his unfortunate fellows at- 
tacked their tasks explosively — the 
air blue with multi-syllabled profan- 
ity, and anger dancing about like 
summer lightning. Now and then, 
people came and inserted tubes in- 
to these unfortunates, and per- 
formed some other indignities upon 
them. 

The paranexus, the complex sub- 
stance, the “Oil of Dog” that was 
needed for stimulation of the Pro- 
grammed, while it could be taken 
from any humans, could only be 
had in its prime form from a de- 
praved, insane sort of Very Angry 
Men, 



B ut today George Gnevni was 
not himself. There was only a 
sullenness in him, not the required 
flaming purple anger. 

“We have to prod him,” said un- 
der-doctor Cotrel. “We can’t waste 
a whole day on him. He’s sick 
enough. He tests at a high enough 
pitch of excitement. Why won’t he 
put out? Why won’t he get mad?” 
“I have an idea,” said under-doc- 
tor Devon. “We have an inner-of- 
fice memo that one of the Pro- 
grammed has recognized kinship 
with him. You remember when Wut 
was in a slump? We got a Pro- 
grammed up here who threw an 
arm around him and called him 
Uncle Wilbur. The way Wut explod- 
ed, seismographs must have record- 
ed the shock at a considerable dis- 
tance. We had to move fast to pre- 
vent him from damaging the Pro- 
grammed. And then Wut was so 
mad that we were able to use him 
around the clock for seventy-two 
hours. How our Very Angry Men 
do hate the Programmed! They call 
them the things.” 

“Good. Anything that worked on 
Wut ought to work double on Gnev- 
ni. Get the Programmed Person up 
here. We’ll have him at ugly 
George.” 

“Her. She’s a Shadier Movement 
Programmed and so technically a 
female.” 

“Better yet. 1 can hardly wait, 
Gnevni is the most spectacular of 
them all when he really goes wild. 
We should get a good production 
from him.” 

Peredacha, the talented little 
Shadier Movement Programmed, 



34 



IF 




came to the Cortin Institute Build- 
ing — the Milk Shed. She under- 
stood the situation and enjoyed it. 
Tlie Programmed have their humor 
— more urbane than that of Hu- 
mans, and yet as genuine — and 
they appreciate the hilarity of an 
incongruous . confrontation. 

Peredacha was something of an 
actress, for all the Programmed 
have a talent for mimicry. She con- 
sidered the role for a moment, and 
she put all her talent into it. 

And she did it! She made herself 
into the most pathetic urchin since 
the Little Match Girl. Yet she was 
a Programmed and not a Human; 
it was as though a gear box should 
put on a waifs shawl and turn tear- 
jerker. 

They brought her in. 

‘Tapa!” Peredacha cried and 
rushed towards Gnevni. 

The attendants had closed be- 
tween them to prevent damage 
when the anger of the low man 
should rise like a jagged wave. 

The show should have been great- 
er than the one that Wut had once 
put on for less reason. Gnevni was 
a bigger man with more power of 
anger, and the situation was even 
more ridiculous. It should have set 
records on the decibel-recorder, 
filled the room with brimstone, and 
enriched the vocabulary of scatolo- 

gy- 

But it didn’t. 

The face of George Gnevni was 
slack, and he shook his heavy head 
sadly. 

‘‘Take the child away,” he said 
dully. “I will not be responsible for 
my feelings today.” 



I t was a new morning and 
George Gnevni must return to 
his brutal livelihood. 

A too-happy puppy came bound- 
ing up to him — a bundle of hys- 
terically gay yipes with a waggling 
rump and tail hitched on to them. 

“Hello, little fellow,” Gnevni said 
and bent down to pet it. But the 
puppy was not programmed for 
such treatment. It was made to be 
kicked by angry men. It threw itself 
into a series of reverse somersaults 
and heart-rending wails as though it 
had been kicked indeed. 

“Oh, the poor little toy!” said 
Gnevni. “It has never known kind- 
ness.” 

“Look, Gnevni,” said an inferior 
sort of man who came up, “the dog 
was made for one thing only — so 
that twelve or thirteen of you hot- 
fires could kick it every morning 
and get into your mood. Now kick 
to.” 

“I won’t do it.” 

“ni report you.” 

“I don’t care. How could anyone 
harm that poor little tyke?” 

The Crippled Old Lady came up 
— shaking as with palsy. “A glor- 
ious good morning to you, my good 
man,” she said to Gnevni. 

“And a fine morning to you, my 
lady,” he said. 

“What? You’re not supposed to 
say that! You’re supposed to kick 
my crutches out from under me and 
then knock me down and trample on 
me. It helps get you in your mood. 
Crippled Old Ladies are infuriating 
sights to the Very Angry Men; they 
make them even angrier. Everybody 
knows that.” 



AUD MAN

‘*1 just don’t believe that I will 
do it today, ah — Margaret, is that 
not your name? A fine day to you, 
my dear.” 

“Knock off that fine day stuff! I 
have my job to do. I’m a mood piece. 
You blow-tops are supposed to kick 
out my crutches and tromp me down 
to get in your mood. Now start 
kicking or I’ll report you.” 

“Do so if you must, my dear.” 

G nevni went to his job in the 
Cortin Institute Building, and 
there he was good for nothing. 

Mad? He wasn’t even sullen He 
was puzzled and pleasant, and when 
you have one of the old stand-bys 
go pleasant on you you’re in trouble. 
He was civil to everybody and gave 
them all the jitters. He completed 
his mechanical tasks in an hour — 
finding them much easier when he 
attacked them calmly. But he wasn’t 
supposed to find them easier. 

So there was consternation in the 
Department. Gnevni had been the 
best producer of them all. They 
couldn’t let him go by like that. 

“Damn you, get mad!” under-doc- 
tor Cotrel shouted and shook him. 
“We won’t have any malingering on 
the job. Get mad and start putting 
out.” 

“I just don’t seem able to get mad 
today,” said Gnevni honestly. 

“You double-damned will get 
mad, you crud-head!” pursued un- 
der-doctor Cotrel. Cotrel seemed ra- 
ther upset himself. “Under-doctor 
Devon! Over-doctor Ratracer! Di- 
rector Duggle! Come help me with 
this pig-headed fellow. He won’t get 
mad.” 



“He’s got to get mad,” said under- 
doctor Devon. “We’ll make the filth- 
eating fink get mad.” 

“It looks bad,” said Director Dug- 
gle. “He was at only half efficiency 
yesterday, and today he’s good for 
nothing at all. Well, put him through 
the routine. We can’t have him go- 
ing sour at us.” 

They put him through the routine. 
It was brutal. It would have made 
a roaring devil out of the sweetest 
saint. Even spectators commonly 
became white with fury when such 
a thing was put on, and there was 
no limit to the effect on the victim. 
Gnevni endured it with composed 
sorrow but without anger. And when 
even the routine didn’t work what 
more could you do to him? 

Under - doctor Cotrel began to 
cuff and kick him: “Get mad, you 
slimy sulphurous son of a she shink! 
Get mad, you mud-headed old mon- 
key! Get mad, you dirt-eating mutt- 
head! You slobber-mouthed donkey, 
get mad!” 

They brought in others. They 
even brought in Peredacha — hop- 
ing she would have a more positive 
effect ^on him than she had had the 
day before. But Gnevni brightened 
up to see her. 

“Ah, it is my little daughter! I 
sent you notes at intervals through 
the evening and night, but I guess 
you did not receive them. It is so 
wonderful just to see you again.” 

“Why you bat-whiskered old bum, 
was it you who sent those notes? 
‘Sweet papa’. You? By the shop 
where I was made, I never heard 
of anything like it before!” 

“Do not be cruel, Peredacha. You 



36 



IF 




are all that I care for in the world. 
With you I could become a new 
man.” 

“Well, not being human I guess I 
can be humane. I’ll look after you, 
ugly papa. But they don’t want you 
to become a new man; as the old 
one you were the best they had. 
Come now, get mad for the peo- 
ple. It’s your job.” 

“I know, but I’m unable to do it. 
I have been thinking, Peredacha, 
that since you are my daughter in a 
way — cortin of my cortin and ad- 
renalin of my adrenalin — perhaps 
the two of us might go off some- 
where and — ” 

“Holy howling hog!” Under-doc- 
tor Cotrel took off in a screech too 
high for the human ear to follow, 
so perhaps only Peredacha heard 
and flushed. And then Cotrel broke 
up completely. He kicked and beat 
on Gnevni. He shrilled and sobbed 
and gobbled. And when his sounds 
once more became intelligible it was 
a screaming, “Get mad, damn you, 
get mad!” 

Cotrel was a lean man, but pow- 
erfully corded and muscled, and 
now every cord of muscle and nerve 
stood glaringly out on him black 
and purple. 

That plan was plain frantic in his 
displeasure at Gnevni. The flying 
foam from his lips flecked the room 
— something you would not have 



expected from under-doctor Cotrel. 

44Tt is all right,” said Director 

X Duggle. “Gnevni was about 
finished in any case. The best of 
them are only good for a year or two 
— the pace is a terrific one. And we 
are lucky to have his replacement 
ready at hand.” 

“Replacement?” pared the livid 
Cotrel. “He’s got to get mad! 
There isn’t any replacement.” And 
he continued to strike Gnevni. 

“I believe that the director has 
you in mind, Cotrel,” said over-doc- 
tor Ratracer. “Yes. I am sure of ii.” 

“Me? I am under-doctor Cotrel! 
I make five hundred Guzman d’or a 
month!” 

“And now you will make five,” 
said Director Duggle. “Grinding 
poverty is a concomitant of your 
new job. I had suspected you had a 
talent for it. Now I am sure. You 
begin immediately. You become the 
latest, and soon I hope the best, of 
the Very Angry Men.” 

Cotrel became so, and immedi- 
ately. Gnevni had been good. Wut 
before him had been one of the best. 
But for carrying-on- noise and stink 
generally, there was never such an 
exhibition as Mad Man Cotrel now 
put on — getting into the spirit of 
his new job. 

He was the maddest man you 
ever sawl END

GREMMIE ’S 
REEF 

by HAYDEN HOWARD 

ILLUSTRATED BY FINLAY 

The surf was perfect, the reef 
was ideal— whof difference did 
it make if it wasn't of Earth? 



I 

D angeiously overbalanced by his 
long fire-engine-red surf- 
board, the boy tried to climb down 
the cliff. 

White gujls ballooned in the up- 
draft of wind against the dusty white 
cliff.. He slipped. His skinny feet 
scurried for footholds down the 
crumbling chalk. The high wind of 
the Pacific Ocean knifed his wide 
eyes, and the hissing updraft lifted 
his red surfboard like a wing in his 
arms. Staggering high above the 



high-tide surf, he fell downward. 

‘'The same to you!’' The fallen 
boy spat chalk and sand and the 
taste of blood. With stinging knees, 
he knelt on the narrow beach beside 
his red surfboard, fingering the 
chalk-streaked dents. “You dinged 
my board, too!” 

The seawind ruffled his thick 
brown thatch of hair. On top of his 
bent head, his fluttering hair glowed 
yellow from his mother’s pero.xide 
bottle, junior high school style. Surf- 
er style. In the dazzling beach sun- 
light he wore a halo. But his stub- 



38 





born lower lip was bleeding as he 
scowled down at the damage to his 
surfboard. 

Behind his back, the surface of 
the ocean writhed. A gleaming area 
as large as a football field bulged 
the surface, quivering, and sank 
down a few feet, forming rows of 
swells in deep water where no swells 
should be. The tide was going down, 
and low tide would expose it. It 
looked almost like the flank of a 
huge animal. 

And if any animal — any Earthly 
animal — were that bright purple 
color. 

'^T^rning, the boy glared at the 
-I shore-break, the steep waves 
breaking unridably close upon the 
sand, and looked no further out. 
His more alert brother would have 
noticed the disturbed water out there 
where the gulls were wheeling and 
crying. But the boy was scowling 
at his damaged surfboard again. 
“Crumby board! If I try to ride 
these waves, probably break in half.” 

The surfboard already was a 
patchwork of fiberglass-cloth re- 
pairs disguised with red paint. It was 
his brother’s old board, scarred from 
heroic wipe-outs onto the rodcs at 
Hammond’s Reef, spectacular clob- 
berings at Rincon Point, collisions at 
Huntington Beach concrete pier and 
other really great surfing spots where 
his brother wouldn’t take him. 

His famous brother would raise 
his eyebrows in mock amazement 
that he, Ted, would even ask to tag 
along. “Decision negative.” His 
head-shaking brother was a mighty 
high school SENIOR, a magnificent 



suntan-lotion bronze with ooh-ah 
muscles from years of paddling surf- 
boards, and a modest grin. 

To make it worse, his brother was 
an eager-beaver brain who got all 
“A’s” last semester, a member of 
the — bugles, please — California 
Scholastic Federation. Worse still, 
his brother had poked thermometers 
into sea anenomes and won First 
Prize in the Science Fair. He got his 
picture in the newspaper. 

Now, instead of watching televis- 
ion like a normal guy, his brother 
studied right through Midnite Movie. 
His brother was praying for a 
scholarship to Stanford to study 
marine biology. His brother was 
sweating out the National Merit 
Scholarship Tests. His brother had 
developed a temper like a hand 
grenade. Groaning, his brother 
would now permit himself only two 
hours of surfing per week. During 
those two hours — 

“Go home!” his brother would 
yell when Ted followed his brother’s 
surfing club to the beach. “Go 
home. You can’t surf. These waves 
are too big. You’ll get clobbered. 
And don’t break any bottles on the 
beach, you gremmie!” 

His brother^ surfing buddies 
would laugh like crazy. 

“I am not a gremmie.” Alone be- 
neath the chalk cliff, now the boy 
glared seaward at the unridable 
five-foot high shorebreak. 

These waves crashed straight down 
with popping noises. Their white 
soup jumbled straight in over the 
high-tide sand. He knew that the 
straight shape of the beach and the 
deep water directly offshore made 



GREMMIPS REEF 



39 




this place impossible for surfing. 
Surfers never came here, so he 
could practice stupidly riding the 
soup all day without anybody laugh- 
ing at him. 

He waxed his board. He dragged 
it into the knee-deep soup. He still 
did not notice what had happened 
out in deep water. 

W hirling, he vaulted on to his 
board. As he tried to stand 
erect, his board shot out from un- 
der him like a cake of soap. He fell 
backward, plopping awkwardly in 
the shallows. He sprang up, glancing 
guiltily at the cliff-top. There was 
no one to witness his embarrass- 
ment. Dripping, he chased after his 
board. The wind turned icy. 

The next try, his board twisted 
beneath his feet like a treacherous 
snake, and he fell sideways, flailing 
the air with one arm, ending up 
with an earful of sand. The tide was 
going down, and he kept falling off 
his board and trying to stand up on 
it, and falling off and trying to 
stand up with endless determination. 

His scoutmaster had described 
him: “Most single-minded kid 1 

ever saw. Spends all day trying to 
tie one knot. Also most unobservant. 
Lucky we don’t live in Africa. Fd 
tell him to pitch his tent between 
four tree trunks, and he’d pitch 
it underneath an elephant. That 
kid’s narrow eyes would never no- 
tice.” 

Lower lip thrust out, when Ted 
tried the soup again he stood up all 
the way to the beach — almost. Top- 
pling forward, he leaped, landing 
deftly on his feet, and his board 



whacked him across the shins agon- 
izingly. 

“Fll show him! I can too surf! 
Some day — great big eight-foot 
walls breaking on Hammond’s Reef 
— when my crumby brother chick- 
ens, Fll ride one. I will! Or a tube, 
a really big tube breaking along the 
Santa Barbara sandspit — ten feet 
high,” he lapsed into pure fantasy, 
“ — twenty feet high at — at the 
Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii.” 

All this time the tide was going 
down. 

Staring out at the vast Pacific, 
Ted blinked. 

Way out there, shimmering semi- 
circular bulges rose in the water as 
if swells were passing over a sub- 
merged reef. 

“There’s no reef out there!” 

As he watched, one of the swells 
creamed over, at least two hundred 
yards from shore, an easy down- 
pouring like Waikiki. 

“Like wow!” He could hardly 
believe it. His brother had taken 
him spearfishing out there, sloshing 
around with fins and masks, and 
there hadn’t been any reef. The 
water had been twenty feet deep 
with dark beds of pebbles and weeds 
and light patches of sand — nothing 
to make these perfect surfing waves 
build up. 

Why now? 

“Don’t ask no questions,” he 
whispered his junior high school 
motto, “just have fun, man!” 

P addling out with hurried strokes, 
as if his reef would swim away 
or something, Ted discovered it was 
a heck of a long way out there. 



40 



IF 




Those waves were big, with white 
teeth. 

“Worst can do — is clobber me,” 
he gasped, paddling harder. 

Ahead of him a glassy swell stood 
up, with flashing schools of an- 
chovies silhouetted above his head. 
And up. His board flopped safely 
over its unbroken crest.' He paddled 
beyond the break and came about. 
This reef seemed to cover as much 
space as a football field with an up- 
ward bulge near the fifty yard line. 

Vaguely, briefly, he imagined it 
was some sort of sandpile down 
there. But imagination was some- 
thing he didn’t fuss with. That was 
his brother’s department. His sun- 
burned nose wrinkling, Ted grinned 
with excitement. Never had he tried 
to catch a wave as big as the mon- 
ster swell that was building up over 
the reef and gliding toward him. 

“No questions,” he thought, pad- 
dling like mad to stay ahead, to 
catch the curl or be cleaned-up. 
“Just got to surf, man.” He glanced 
back blurry-eyed as the swell loom- 
ed, then heaved under him. Like an 
elevator it lifted his board, and the 
nose of his surfboard lunged out 
over nothingness. In that instant of 
truth, he didn’t chicken, didn’t back- 
water, didn’t ask questions. “Yee- 
oww!” 

His mischievously grinning junior 
high school science teacher had 
written on the blackboard: In the 
Universe of men and oceans, planets 
and space, there are galaxies of 
answers so amazing that we don’t 
even know their questions. “Give 
us — a new and astounding question 
— uh — Ted.” 



“Huh?” Ted had blushed, hot- 
faced, the schoolroom dim to his 
eyes because he had been staring 
out the window. He scratched his T- 
shirt with embarrassment. He didn’t 
know what to answer. A questioner 
he didn’t want be. All he wanted 
was to be a surfer — the greatest 
surfer who ever lived! 

“Yee-oww-eeeee!” Triumphantly 
shouting, he stood erect upon his 
surfboard. His surfboard seemed to 
grow eyes and a brain, a built-in 
guidance system, as it slid down 
across the face of the wave, a per- 
fect right-slide away from the bul- 
ging center of the reef. “I am an 
eagle!” 

In his self-imposed ignorance, Ted 
didn’t even know this surfer-shout 
had originated from the excited 
word-signals of an early Russian 
cosmonaut, circling the Earth. 

The ocean spray whirled past his 
triumphant face. Away from the 
influence of the reef the wave 
smoothed out and his board slowed. 
Ted shuffled backward, stalling his 
surfboard and swinging its nose sea- 
ward over the declining hump of the 
swell without falling off. He drop- 
ped to his knees, paddling back to- 
ward the wonderful new reef, grin- 
ning and wheezing with exertion. 

“Man, if my big-wheel brother — 
saw that great ride — me — his eye- 
balls would drop out!” 

H is brother’s eyeballs would have 
become somewhat distended if 
he had taken a close look at the reef. 
But even Ted’s brother would not 
have been able to ask the inspired 
question, the astounding question 



42 



IF 




which could lead to an answer, an 
explanation of the reef. The key 
question was too wild: 

Question: What is the connection 
between the appearance of this reef 
and the sudden disappearance back 
in 1964 of our Mariner IX space 
probe? 

If asked, Ted would have guessed 
a Mariner was a — uh — not a sail- 
or — a satellite, maybe? His brother 
would have described it as a deep 
space probe physically resembling a 
miniature oil derrick and program- 
med to orbit a neighboring planet. 
At least. Mariner IX was. It also 
could react to command signals from 
Earth, radioing back information its 
sensors — its primitive electrical 
nervous system — had collected. Its 
behavior patterns were far less com- 
plicated and less flexible than a rat’s. 
In this respect, Ted’s brother would 
have compared it to an amoeba — 

A glittering mass of water curled 
high above the reef, a hollowed 
wave that made Ted shout with joy: 
“A tube, a real tube!” 

There couldn’t be much water 
over the center of the reef to make 
such a beautiful tube. The tide was 
going down, he thought. Hurriedly, 
he positioned his surfboard across 
the center of the reef when the wave 
came. He wanted to try to go right 
through the next tube the way big 
guys did in surfing movies in Hawaii. 
His eyes widened. Big swell coming; 
should he or shouldn’t he? 

Ted took a little chicken-hearted 
forward stroke. Before he could 
backwater, his board took off across 
the face of the wave as if it had a 
mind of its own, right-sliding down 



and down until the crest teetered 
high above him and his board was 
shooting along the foot of the liquid 
cliff. His right hand extended as if 
to hold back the overhanging wave- 
tube. The crest toppled above his 
head as he ran toward the nose of 
his board, trying to increase speed 
before the tunnel-like wave ate him. 

Even his imaginative brother 
would not have considered that an 
answering space probe would enter 
Earth’s gravitational field. This was 
five months after Mariner IX unex- 
pectedly went silent, only five 
months after Mariner IX emitted a 
last squeak more characteristic of 
a rat than an amoeba. The embar- 
rassing silence that followed the 
newspapers had blamed on another 
of the long history of short-circuits, 
electrical malfunctions and battery 
failures which had plagued the Na- 
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad- 
ministration. Privately, certain ulcer- 
ous administrators cursed the day 
that electricity was — uh — invent- 
ed. 

In their tortured imaginations they 
would have been willing to believe 
even an organic space probe, if it 
promised to be free of short-circuits, 
electrical malfunctions, battery fail- 
ures and congressional investigating 
committees. Ted’s brother would 
have laughed: “Impossible! Living 
protoplasm unshielded can’t survive 
the vacuum and hard radiation of 
outer space.” 

The microscopic spore had enter- 
ed Earth’s gravitional field, drift- 
ed safely through the Van Allen 
radiation belt, spiraled inward 
tlu-ough the crowding atoms of

Earth’s upper atmosphere and set- 
tled in the Pacific Ocean. 

Its chromosomes had been arti- 
ficially arranged, programmed so 
that it would grow in a predeter- 
mined pattern. When it was huge 
enough, its billions of neurons would 
be able to generate jolts of electri- 
city an electric eel would envy, and 
no short-circuits as it radioed back 
information its blind sensors had 
collected. It was the answering space- 
probe, growing huge as a roof along 
the ocean floor. 

T he nose of Ted’s surfboard, 
pearl-diving, rammed into the 
reef. His arms spread like wings as 
he flipped over the nose of his board. 
The liquid roof caved in. 

His knees hit bottom. The blind- 
ing wave-surge dragged him along 
the reef and left him sitting there, 
exposed. Between swells the reef 
now had only six inches of water on 
it. 

To his surprise, his knees didn’t 
feel scraped or skinned. Beneath his 
feet the reef felt rubbery. 

As he peered down, he almost 
imagined he could see the bottom 
deep beneath him instead of right 
under his toes as he waded. Charac- 
teristically, his eyes narrowed with 
suspicion, as if he was afraid some 
big guys, like his brother, were 
playing a joke on him. But he still 
thought he could make out blurry 
beds of pebbles and weeds and light 
patches of sand, all as dim as if 
they were twenty feet below his bare 
feet. The next wave knocked him 
rumble-seat over the tea-kettle. 

In the deeped water inside the 



reef, wheezing and snorting, Ted 
dog-paddled toward shore, pursuing 
his surfboard. 

“Clobbered me — but I can real- 
ly surf!” Ted sloshed excitedly 
through the shallows after his surf- 
board, which was cruising upside- 
down with its skeg-keel in the air 
like a little sail gleaming purple. 

Purple? 

“My crumby brother! What’d he 
do — making my board’s skeg turn 
purple?” The nose of his red surf- 
board, where it stuck the reef, was 
stained purple, too. “Doesn’t rub 
off. But I’ll twitch him. I’ll show 
him I can really surf, man!” 

Dragging his board to the base 
of the chalk cliff, leaving it there 
unguarded, a stupid move in any 
man’s language, Ted scrambled up 
the cliff and hot-footed over the 
burning concrete sidewalks for five 
blocks. 

iCT^avid, David!” he yelled his 
way through the living room 
into his brother’s bedroom. “I can 
surf. I can really surf! You got to 
see me. Big tubes, I been riding ’em. 
Really big like Hawa — Leggo me. 
Ow!” 

“Then shut up, you gremmie, 
when I’m trying to study!” David 
seemed slightly irritated, like an 
awakened grizzly bear with his foot 
caught in a trap and attacked by 
hornets. ‘’Everybody bothering me!” 

“Please, David, you got to see! 
Really big surfing waves.” 

“Shut up. ril never win a Na- 
tional Merit Scholarship Award with 
you always bothering me!” David 
roared dramatically. “I got to study.”

“Beautiful surfing waves, David, 
on a reef like — ” 

“I’m never going surfing again,” 
David groaned as if he was trying to 
win an Academy Award.

“Get outa here! Get your dirty 
feet off my rug!” 

“Please, David! Just watch me 
ride one wave, just one wave.” 

“You stupid crock, even your 
knees are purple. I said get your 
dirty purple feet off my rug.” David 
bayoneted him backward off the rug 
with his hard-poking Karate finger. 
“You been wading in athlete’s foot 
medicine. No, you little fiend, you 
been trampling sea hares. Purple sea 
slugs to you, you half-pint monster.” 
“I have not! This purple won’t 
hurt your crumby rug. See, this pur- 
ple doesn’t rub off,” Ted yelled an- 
grily. “All I wanted you to do was 
watch me ride one wave.” 
“Shuddup!” 

The trigger word: wave, seemed 
to redouble David’s fury. Breathing 
hard, he pinned Ted against the 
enormous metal short-wave radio 
transmitter cabinet. Its remaining 
knobs and switches felt uncomfort- 
ably bumpy against Ted’s bare back. 
The transmitter had been partially 
dismantled because David had lost 
his ham radio license. The F. C. C. 
had taken it away after Federal 
Communications Commission inves- 
tigators had discovered it was David 
who was experimenting on unau- 
thorized wave lengths. 

“Just one wave, David,” Ted 
squeaked. 

“No! No! No! I’m supposed to be 



studying. I’ll never win a scholarship 
to Stanford now.” David’s room al- 
ready was decorated with red and 
white Stanford pennants covering 
his butterfly collections, neatly pin- 
ned row on row. 

His Karate finger jabbed deeper 
into Ted’s stomach. “Go away, you 
little gremmie.” 

Ted tried to — lunging sideways. 
His arm sloshed into David’s twenty- 
gallon aquarium, tearing the black 
paper screening. 

D avid yelped with horror. “You’ve 
disturbed ’em.” 

Two eyeless pink things emerged 
from the muddy tunnels at the bot- 
tom of the aquarium, darted about 
and vanished again. 

“How’ll I win another Science 
Fair Award with you always bother- 
ing my blind gobies!” David was 
feeding them bait doped with fluo- 
rescent dye so that he could watch 
them in the dark. “Get away from 
my black light. You’re dripping 
water on it, you crock!” David had 
caught the gobies, tiny blind fish, 
by digging up the mud-tunnels of 
ghost shrimps in a tidepool. In the 
aquarium he had laid a sheet of 
glass on the mud, a roof for their 
tunnels. 

In darkness, when David had 
turned on the ultra-violet fluores- 
cent light, the gobies glowed purple 
as if they had been dyed. David 
had color-tagged them so he could 
watch their movements while the 
blind gobies thought they were in 
darkness, invisible. Glowing purple, 
they wriggled out of the tunnels of 
their host, the ghost shrimp, to

search for more glowing purple 
food — provided by David, the hard- 
eyed experimenter. 

‘'Please, DavidI Just watch me 
ride one wave across the reef. You 
won’t even have to climb down the 
cliff—.” 

“What cliff? There’s no cliff at 
Hammond’s Reef.” 

“This is. another reef, David. A 
better reef.” 

“I got to study. What reef are you 
talking about?” 

Without thinking, Ted blurted the 
truth: “At the Chalk Cliff.” 

“The Chalk Cliff?” David roared. 
“No surfing waves, no reef at the 
Chalk Cliff. Whatta you mean 
bothering me? Whatta you mean 
telling lies? No surfing at the Chalk 
Cliff. Not even you gremmies go 
there. The Chalk Cliff! Have a 
knuckleburger!” 

“Ow, David! A reef, a new reef. 
Don’t cork me again, David.” 

“Then say that you’re a dirty 
lying bothering little gremmie. Go 
on, say it! — There is no reef at the 
Chalk Cliff. 

“But there is a reef. Please, David! 
A surfers* reef.” 

“Now you got me so nervous I’ll 
never study again. Everybody bother- 
ing me. I got to get out of here,” 
David groaned. “I’m going to Ham- 
mond’s Reef.” 

But when David’s 1937 Ford 
“woodie” station wagon burped to a 
halt, it was at the Chalk Cliff. 

4 4Qee, David! Look, David, real 
tubes! Look at ’em building 
out there on the reef!” 

David’s adam’s apple jiggled. 



Speechless,, he stood up through the 
hole in the roof of his “woodie.” 
Finally, his voice squeaked with awe 
and joy. “I’m stoked! 

“A new reef, an anomaly, a phe- 
nomenon,” David’s voice faded as 
he whipped his surfboard over the 
tailgate of his “woodie.” 

“Cow-a-bunga!” David yelled like 
a cornball and galloped down the 
slanting cliff as if he’d turned off 
the Law of Gravity. 

Like mad, as if he saw his Perfect 
Wave coming, David paddled toward 
the cresting reef. 

“Hey, wait, David, wait for me. 
It was me you came to watch ride 
one — ” By the time Ted finished 
falling down the cliff, his brother al- 
ready was maneuvering his surf- 
board to take off into a tube. 

Erect, with perfect surfing form, 
David angled across the face of the 
wave toward the shallows of the hid- 
den reef. His wave shimmered sky- 
ward above his head, rising and 
hollowing into a translucently green 
flowing tube. 

It was beautiful. David’s board 
hit the invisible reef so hard he ran 
right off the nose and seemed to be 
running through the air when he 
vanished into a wave. 

He emerged, crawling eighteen 
inches above the water, when the 
wave passed. On all fours, David 
began thumping the air beneath him, 
his fists bouncing back as if he was 
hitting rubber. The next wave buried 
him. 

David reappeared standing on 
nothing. His raised hands glinted 
purple as he waded toward shore. 
Abruptly, he sank as he stepped off

the edge of the reef. Splattering, he 
swam toward Ted’s board. 

“Stay away or you’ll (something) 
it,” David gasped. “Delicate scienti- 
fic exper — I’ll be famous. Care- 
ful scientific investigation.” He wal- 
lowed hurriedly toward the beach. 

“Wait, David! Watch me ride one, 
just one wave.” 

But David was retreating rapidly 
up the cliff. 

“Now watch me, David, watch 
me!” Taking off, sliding away from 
the center of the reef, Ted rose un- 
steadily on his board. “Look, David! 
Look at me ride!” 

But David had vanished behind 
his “woodie.” 

Without falling off, Ted stalled 
his board and paddled out again. 

“Hey David, watch me this time!” 

David ploughed down the slant- 
ing cliff from his station wagon 
through rising chalk dust with some- 
thing clutched in either hand. He 
splashed through the shallows after 
his capsized board. 

“Look at me, David, look at me 
ride.” Ted fell off. 

David paddled past him mutter- 
ing: “Be quiet, delicate scientific 

tests — ” 

A heavy ballpeen hammer dan- 
gling from one fist, David 
clambered on to the invisible reef. 
With the scientific delicacy of a 
blacksmith, David pounded a huge 
screwdriver into the reef. There was 
an electrical crackling. 

David rose. Ted glimpsed him 
rising ten feet above the ocean as the 
waves rolled back. Then David fell. 
The water spread bright purple. 



With more anger than surprise, 
Ted witnessed his reef and the pro- 
truding handle of David’s screw- 
driver streaking out to sea like a 
periscope trailing purple foam. 

“You ruined my reef! You never 
even watched me ride one wave!” 

To Ted’s disappointed yells, David 
made no reply. David’s contorted 
face seemed purple. 

Even when David became the first 
brilliant purple student to win a 
National Merit Award Scholarship, 
he had very little to say. David spent 
his time scowling at His mirror. Pur- 
ple? 

Now he could never go to Stan- 
ford. Their colors were red and 
white. 

Skin specialists insisted the pur- 
ple dye would wear off, but it didn’t. 
Not even sandpaper. 

Amazingly, David was as popular 
as ever. 

“Put on a gold-colored shirt to go 
with your cute purple face,” David’s 
buxom girl friend giggled, “and en- 
roll at U. S. C. with me.” 

The tragedy was Ted. 

“Everybody staring at me.” Ted 
wouldn’t go out of the house. 
“Everybody laughing at me. I’m not 
a cow. Everybody making jokes 
about a purple cow. Nobody liked 
me to begin with and now they say 
I’m a freak. At least you’re purple 
all over, David. I’m all blotchy. I 
wish I was dead.” 

In deep water the gigantic space 
probe had stopped contracting. It 
had dissolved the intruding screw- 
driver. Gradually it expanded along 
the bottom toward shore, huger than 
ever. As it bulged reef-like toward

the surface, gulls whirled above the 
disturbed water. 

With a shriek, a gull veered away 
as if it had bounced off a plate glass 
window, and crashed into the sea. 
The gull’s sodden breast feathers 
turned purple. It was dead. 

A cross the continent in New 
York’s Yankee Stadium the 
pitcher loosed the first ball of the 
World Series. 

In the boys’ bedroom Ted laughed 
at the portable TV, frantically twist- 
ing the horizontal control knob. 
There was nothing but a jumble of 
upward rolling lines and roaring sta- 
tic on every channel. 

“Wherever I go!” Ted shrieked. 
“Static’s in here, too, so it isn’t just 
the living room TV. It’s everywhere 
I go. Being purple isn’t enough. 
Now I can’t even watch TV!” 

In the living room, that TV set 
shouted clearly: “Strike one!” Its 
perfect picture showed the batter 
turning to stare in amazement at the 
umpire’s upraised arm. 

David had gone out into the hall. 
Now as he came back into the liv- 
ing room, the pitcher’s intent face 
freckled with static snow. The pic- 
ture rolled and David stepped closer 
to adjust the horizontal control. The 
pitcher’s contorted faces peering to 
get the sign from the multiple vibra- 
ting catchers dissolved into a howl- 
ing snowstorm. 

“Terrible static!” David backed 
away, eyeing the rabbit-ears antenna 
on top of the TV set, and the pitcher 
reappeared ghost-like through the 
snow and disappeared again as David 
reached toward the antenna. 



“Have I been electrified? Like 
that glass rod experiment — rubbed 
with silk? Is it me, or — ?” David 
ran out of the living room to look 
for his portable radio. 

The umpire shouted: “Strike 

two!” 

Scowling, the batter bent for a 
handful of dirt, but no one was 
watching him in the living room. 

David was out on the lawn, twist- 
ing the little portable radio from 
side to side. He ran back into the 
bedroom. 

“Listen, listen, Ted, the static’s 
louder when I turn my portable this 
way. The aerial’s wrapped around a 
little card inside my portable radio 
so that it’s directional — .” 

“I don’t care about your lousy 
radio. I don’t care about the World 
Series. All I care about is me. I’m 
a spotted freak. At least you’re pur- 
ple all over. It’s all your fault Vm 
purple spotted.” 

“What can I say?” David stared 
out the window, slowly turning the 
portable radio toward the sea, and 
the static blared. 

David peered at his brother’s 
swollen purple eyes. “Somebody is 
shooting at us. We’re not giving off 
static. I think we’re reflecting k. 
Somebody is following each of us 
with a narrow radio beam — aimed 
like a firehose — no, like a laser. 
We’re a couple of targets. That’s 
what I think.” 

“I don’t care about goofy scienti- 
fic stuff,” Ted bleated. “So shut up 
with all that stuff. It’s your fault, 
you and that lousy reef. I wish I was 
dead!” 

“Don’t talk like that. Get my big

speargun over there.” David carried 
the portable radio. “Yes, outside. I 
want you to come outside. All right, 
put on your hat if you don’t want 
anybody to see your stupid purple 
head.” 

D avid led the way toward the 
Chalk Cliff. 

Ted tagged after him, lugging the 
heavy speargun. A home-made ar- 
belete powered by four thick strands 
of rubber surgical tubing, the spear- 
gun had driven its steel harpoon 
shaft clear through a small leopard 
shark. Above the surface, freed from 
the resistance of the water, the 
speargun was more powerful and 
deadly. 

“Pm going to shoot that thing.” 
Ted’s purple eyelids slitted, and he 
glanced about. But there were no 
amused faces or pitying faces of 
neighbors to see his purple-blotched 
face. 

He stopped. Fitting the three-foot 
long steel shaft into the steel cup, 
hissing with effort, he stretched the 
rubber tubing, cocking the spear- 
gun like a hair-trigger crossbow. He 
ran after his brother. 

Ahead, gulls on the updraft white- 
flagged the edge of the cliff. David 
was peering down. His back was 
bent. He wasn’t saying anything. 

Ted stumbled. “Look, David, 
down there! Something shining on 
top of the water — like a ghost.” 
“That’s what Pm looking at. Sun- 
light reflecting off the spray, the 
dried salt, the organs of its — body. 
Hard to see what shape — Hey you 
little idiot, don’t shoot it!” 

“Keep away from me, David. You 



told me to bring the speargun.” 

“Don’t point it at me! Give it 
here.” 

“Pm going to shoot. Keep away.” 

“Listen, Ted, I told you wrong. 
Shooting it with the speargun isn’t 
going to help us. We’ll still be pur- 
ple, Ted. Give me the speargun. I 
was a stupid crock to tell you to 
bring it. Shooting this thing when 
we don’t know what will happ — 
David lunged. 

Ted scuttled backward along the 
edge of the cliff. 

“Don’t you aim it at me, Ted. I 
told you I was wrong to bring it. 
Shooting won’t solve anything. Look 
what happened when I stuck a 
screwdriver in it. Pm just a crock, 
always poking things with pins or 
thermometers to see what they will 
do. Don’t shoot it with the spear- 
gun!” 

“You keep away from me!” 

“Don’t shoot it.” David’s voice 
softened. “Behind me, you hear the 
portable radio, hear the static. That 
thing down there’s no worm. Only 
stupid crocks and gremmies — ” 
David’s voice rose edgily — “go 
around sticking and poking and pes- 
tering things they don’t know any- 
thing about! 

“You hear the radio static!” 
David’s voice brightened with prom- 
ise. “That thing down there in the 
surf is broadcasting static, on unau- 
thorized wavelengths. Yes, listen! I 
know how to make people believe us 
about this thing — make people take 
us seriously — so hand me the spear- 
gun.” 

But Ted backed off, his narrow 
eyes slitted.

“Hand me the speargun.” David 
followed, “The F. C. C., the Federal 
Communications Commission men, 
remember how they caught me when 
I broadcast on unauthorized wave- 
lengths. All we have to do is report 
this thing, and their tracer equip- 
ment will — ” 

Whirling at the brink of the cliff, 
Ted fired the speargun. The long 
steel harpoon shafted flashed down- 
ward like an arrow. Ted scrambled 
down the cliff toward the lashing 
sea. He wallowed in the purple 
staining shallows, even ducking his 
head into the spreading purple dye. 

“You stupid little gremmief’ 
David violently dragged his brother 
out on to the purple sand. “What 
did you do that for? Now we don’t 
know what it’ll do. You idiot, after 
all I said, why — why did you have 
to go and shoot it?” 

“At least,” Ted gasped, purple dye 
streaming down his face, “at least 
now I’m purple all over like you. 
Leggo!” 

But David arm-locked his brother, 
rushing him toward the cliff. “Butt 
out of here! That thing is spoutii^ 
purple like a geyser.” 

“Hope it dies,” Ted wheezed as 
he climbed the cliff. “Look at my 
hands, like your hands now. But I 
don’t want purple hands!” he cried 
out, clawing the purple chalk. 

He was sobbing as David shoved 
him up to the top of the purple- 
sprayed cliff. Above him, purple 
gulls and purple fog rose in the up- 
draft and swept inland on the sea 
wind. As the two boys ran toward 
home there was a purple mist before 
their eyes.

P urple faces yelled in horror at 
each other and scattered into 
purple houses. A purple policeman 
stared helplessly at the purple sky. 

Purple defense officials shouted 
into purple telephones. A purple 
military mind instinctively pushed a 
purple button. The locks clicked in 
the deep missile silos. The clocks 
ticked while an A. S. W.- plane, with 
a long magnetic-anomaly detector 
protruding from its tail like a sting- 
er, droned low along the cliffs and 
over the purple surf. Its bomb-bay 
door opened. A fat gleam of metal 
tumbled downward through the air 
and splashed as the plane veered 
away in frantic evasive action. The 
purple explosion mushroomed to- 
ward the stratosphere. 

The organic probe of the third 
planet had blossomed, seeded. 

Catalytic molecules spread with 
the winds, triggering film of moisp- 
ture which coated plants, planarian 
worms, plagiarists and platypuses,

Purple people ran randomly 
through the streets of Salt Lake

eyeballs purple with outrage. 

Purple cows chomped contentedly 
on the purple grass of Western 
Europe — and Eastern Europe. 

Purple presidents and dictators 
shouted angrily back and forth via 
purple-moistured microphones. 
Louder and louder the static en-

RESCUE 

MISSION 

BY KIT REED 



She was a maiden in distress, 
seeking aid against the brutes 
who refused to take her life! 



H e was reading in the living 
room of his late uncle’s house 
when a piece of the dust ruffle de- 
tached itself from the couch and 
started moving. 

He watched distractedly, not pay- 
ing any particular attention at first, 
then, curious, finally annoyed, be- 
cause the thing would keep moving, 
and when it reached a point midway 
between the couch and his chair he 
got up and removed the dust ruffle 
with the tip of his shoe, revealing a 
bug as big as his hand. 

That night, in bed, he was read- 
ing again when he began plumping 
up the pillows for sleep. He thought 
it only an annoyance when the pil- 
low on the left plumped back. He 



gave it another couple of pats, found 
as he turned over that it had disar- 
ranged itself and thumped it, really 
hard this time, with his fist. It 
seemed agitated, and as he gave it 
another thump something muscular 
and black slithered out of the pillow- 
case faster than he could apprehend 
it and began circling, rushing like a 
mad monorail around and around 
the baseboards of the room, going 
faster and faster until it dissipated 
itself finally and fell in a limp heap 
in the corner. 

His first thought was to get some- 
one to help him remove it, but he 
was alone in the house, and he had 
not lived in the neighborhood long 
enough to get to know any of the 



53 



neighbors. He picked it up on a 
broom (as he had the bug) and then, 
satisfied that he was alone in the 
room, he turned on his side and went 
to sleep. 

The next morning the wolfskin 
rug by his late uncle’s bed seemed to 
come alive. It skittered around the 
floor like an outsized doormat, go- 
ing along on four rubbery pink 
legs, and he bundled up the creature 
(whatever it was) in the wolfskin 
and dumped it out the window with- 
out even having a closer look. He 
had the strangest feeling, as he let 
it go and it plummeted down the 
hill, that it had been trying to tell 
him something. 

He was not a nervous man (he 
was, after all, a jM*ofessor of mathe- 
matics) but when his toaster belched 
twice and disgorged a covey of cen- 
tipedes which massed and marched 
on him, coming rank on rank across 
the breakfast table, he said to him- 
self, “This must stop,” and he went 
over the house with a series of in- 
secticides and heavy sticks, not turn- 
ing up so much as a stray spider, or 
a single ant. 

He thought briefly of getting 
someone in to live with him, some- 
one who was good with wild life. 
But he was a confirmed bachelor of 
independent leanings and he could 
not imaging himself accommodating 
another person, especially now, on 
his sabbatical. He was a small mus- 
cular man with a determined jaw 
and the head of a battle-scarred cat. 
The more he thought of asking 
someone else to help him cope, the 
less he liked it. 

“Hell with it,” he said, giving the 



house a final once-over. Then he 
put crawling things out of his mind 
and went on up to bed. 

B ecause the insecticides lin- 

gered, he spent that night on 
the porch outside his uncle’s second- 
story room. It seemed high enough, 
and safe enough. He rather liked the 
way the hillside swept down and 
away from him, and the fact that 
the porch was no more than a plat- 
form with a low railing and a tele- 
scope, so that it was rather like 
sleeping at the edge of a cliff. He 
kept an eye peeled for wild life until 
nine or ten at least. Then, exhaust- 
ed by the day’s activities with insec- 
ticides, he curled up in his sleeping 
bag and went to sleep. 

He waked at three, not knowing 
why. 

The air was as sharp and chill as 
white wine. Each leaf on each of the 
black trees that overhung the porch 
seemed magnified in the early morn- 
ing chill. He was aware of the leaves 
— every one of them — and could 
not keep himself from thinking of 
the thousands of leaves on thousands 
of twigs, all gathered to hang over 
him, each motionless and distinct. 
He sat up, wondering why in all this 
stillness he was trembling. 

Then, because he knew he would 
not sleep for a while, he got up and 
paced the porch, smoking, finally 
coming to a stop at his uncle’s tele- 
scope. He turned it to the skies first, 
trying to sight the moon through a 
break in the trees. Then, realizing 
that it was set for closer ranges, he 
gave up and trained it on the valley 
below, looking over fields and sleep-

ing houses, fixing finally on a house 
on the hill which rose at the other 
side. 

The telescope was excellent at 
such distances. He could see figures 
framed in the picture window and 
then faces and finally expressions, 
warped and highlighted by a blue 
brilliance that cast every shadow in 
sharp relief and seemed to dominate 
the room. 

The house itself was a low, brick 
rambler, bourgeois and unremark- 
able except for the fact that there 
were three glossy, black cars pulled 
up around it, like cattle at a feeding 
station. The whole was lit by a pow- 
erful, unearthly blue glow that 
seemed important to the young man 
only in retrospect; at the time he 
was so taken up with the quarrel, or 
fight, going on behind the picture 
window that he hardly marked or 
noticed it. , 

There seemed to be four men in 
the room, three advancing on a 
fourth, arguing, finally coming to 
blows. They were shadows moving 
weirdly in the brilliant, somehow 
mechanical blue light which would 
strike him, as he looked back on it, 
as a conflagration of diamonds, cold 
and at the same time unquenchable. 

Behind the window the activity 
grew more atid more frantic. The 
men were furious now, mouths dis- 
tended in shouts which the young 
man, watching through the tele- 
scope, could see but could not hear. 
They moved faster and faster, in 
growing violence. 

One had raised a stick, or an in- 
strument, to strike another when all 
four stopped suddenly and faced 



what must have been the front door. 

The young man, watching, picked 
out the front door of the house and 
focussed on it, not ready to believe 
that there was indeed a woman in 
night clothes beating on the door 
with bare hands, or that her whole 
body shook with agitation, or that a 
plethora of hair billowed out and 
down her back. 

Before he could refocus his tele- 
scope to make sure, the front door 
opened and closed in a fraction of 
a second and the young woman dis- 
appeared. She had rushed in through 
a crack in the door — or had been 
dragged — and now she was inside. 

Growing stiff from the cold, he 
left his telescope just long enough to 
wrap himself in a blanket. By the 
time he refocussed the icy tele- 
scope, the blue glow was gone. 
The cars were still there, like beetles 
around the carcass of a larger bee- 
tle, and he imagined he could still 
see a crack of blue light between 
hastily-drawn drapes. But there was 
no sign of movement. Enthralled, 
suddenly, by the quick remembered 
image of the woman, he kept the 
telescope trained on the house 
across the valley, keeping his vigil 
until the sun came up and he went 
to sleep. 

V^hen he woke the half-re- 
membered details came back 
like the hazy elements of a dream. 
But there was the telescope. When 
he trained it on the hill opposite 
there was the house, there were the 
signs of a quick departure, to verify 
what he had seen. He went down to 
breakfast, thinking on it. 



RESCUE MISSION

Later he took his morning paper 
to the living room, determined to 
put the whole thing out of his mind. 
When the dust ruffle began moving 
just as he reached for the sports sec- 
tion his first impulse was to trample 
it. But something made him lift it 
first, to see what he would be tram- 
pling, and he saw that this time it 
was a spider, and the spider had a 
note in its mouth. 

Once he had distracted the spider 
with a piece of salami and snatched 
the note from it, he found that it 
was in a clear, legible hand. It said, 
simply and predictably, “HELP.” 

He did not have to guess who had 
sent it. He had known from the look 
of the woman’s back as she had 
pounded on the door across the val- 
ley that she was beautiful, and that 
she needed help. 

“Strange,” he said to himself, 
wanting to do something about it. 
Then he settled down to preparing 
his courses for the term which would 
follow his sabbatical, reminding 
himself that there was little he could 
do until he knew her whereabouts, 
or her problem, or at least her name. 

I AM MAVRA, said the note the 
blacksnake dropped in his lap before 
it took off around the bedroom, 
running until it passed out. I NEED 
YOUR HELP. 

Feeling a certain responsibility, he 
wrote a return note and popped it 
in the blacksnake’s mouth . , . before 
he picked it up on a broom and 
tossed it out the window. 

MARCUS JUSTICE, he said. 
DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU, 
and in a burst of loyalty kept the 
telescope trained on the house 



across the valley until he fell asleep. 
When he woke it was at that same 
still, dead time of night, and the 
house across the valley was alight. 
He watched the four men running 
around in growing excitement, saw 
them rise to a murderous pitch and 
then stop suddenly, and saw the 
woman fling at the door again and 
again, hammering with bare fists un- 
til it opened and someone jerked 
her inside; he imagined that she 
tipped him a wave just before the 
door closed on her. He knew from 
experience that he might as well go 
on back to bed. 

He shook the blacksnake out of 
his pillowslip without even looking 
at it, dumped the toads from his 
bedroom slippers and pushed the 
preying mantis off the nighttable, 
saying, all right, all right, with a 
touch of impatience, as he turned 
off the light. 

T he girl herself was standing in 
front of the fireplace as he 
brought his breakfast coffee into the 
living room. He had taken the note 
from the giant cockroach in the 
pantry without reading it and now 
he beheld the woman, who was lithe 
in black, and held two salamanders 
and a spider straining at a red pat- 
ent leather leash. 

She whispered to the spider, 
which detached itself and made a lit- 
tle rush for his ankles. 

“Don’t do that,” he said, aiming a 
kick at it. The spider slunk away. 

“Oh, I’m sorry,” the girl said in a 
voice like midnight. “I thought ev- 
eryone liked pets.” 

“Not everyone.” He eyed the sala- 



56 



IF 




manders. “What’s on your mind?” 
“Help. I’m from another planet 
and I need your help.” 

“So I understand.” He tugged at 
his tweed jacket, wishing he’d had 
the elbows patched. “Won’t you 
have some tea?” 

She shook her head. “It’s too ur- 
gent. The planets will only be in con- 
junction for the rest of the week, so 
we have to act fast.” 

“We?” 

“You and I.” 

“Why me?” 

“Because last time your uncle 
didn't,” she said, curling up beside 
him. As he stiffened, she shooed the 
salamanders to the other side of the 
room. “I had him all lined up during 
the last conjunction. Then at the last 
minute he deserted me.” 

“Died.” Marcus corrected her. 
“Deserted me.” She made a little 
mouth. “Sometimes I think he died 
on purpose. So he wouldn’t have to 
go through with it.” 

He hated arguments. “If you say 
so. Now what’s going on over there?” 
“Ah,” she said. “You found the 
telescope.” 

“Well, yes. Now what’s all this 
about Uncle Harry?” 

She shook her head sadly. “We 
were — very close — and he had it 
all figured out so I could go.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“It’s perfectly simple,” she said. 
“Those fools are in love with me.” 
“What fools?” He gave the spider 
a nervous kick. 

“My countrymen. Garth Togl- 
Rammy and Seth. Well, all but Seth. 
He knows what his instructions are, 
and he’s ready to go through with 



them.” She looked at him brightly, 
“That^s what all the fighting’s about.” 
He looked at her blankly. 

“It’s perfectly simple,” she said, 
crossing her legs with a rustle of 
silk. “We were sent here ten years 
ago on a mission. I was in my early 
teens.” She looked at him as if this 
explained everything. “I was an ugly 
teenager, when you get right down 
to it. That made the whole plan 
seem perfectly simple. We were to 
collect minerals — and a certain 
amount of information — for three 
years, and then report back to the 
sending station. The house across 
the valley. All we had to do was wait 
for a conjunction. Then the people 
at home would set things in motion 
and transport the boys.” 

“The boys?” 

“Garth,” she said patiently. “Togl. 
Rammy and Seth. But by the time 
the Conjunction came. I’d gotten — 
well — I’d grown. I was more or 
less as you see me, and three of the 
boys were in love with me. They 
wouldn’t let Seth . .” 

Marcus leaned forward suspi- 
ciously. “Wouldn’t let him what?” 
“Set things in motion. The being.” 
She looked at him for a minute, saw 
that he wasn’t comprehending, and 
tried to simplify. “The machine. It’s 
not really a machine, but it’s not 
really a being, either. I don’t know 
what it is, but when the planets are 
in conjunction, it’s strong enough to 
disintegrate three people and re- 
create them somewhere else. 
“Three people,” he said, disturbed. 
“Well, for, coming,” she said. “It 
could take four going back, too, if 
we had the fuel . .” 



RESCUE MISSION 



57 




That — blue light I saw in 
the telescope?” 

“That’s It. Seth takes care of It.” 
“And the — fuel?” 

4 4]y Te,” she said with a lumin- 
-LVl ous smile. “Pm a Catalyst. 
That’s a very big deal, back home. 
You go out beautifully. You simply 
advance into It — the being — the 
machine — and generate enough 
power to send any number of people 
anywhere in the uni,verse.” She lifted 
her head proudly. “Pm told I’ll be 
one of the best. That’s why I was 
chosen for this mission.” 

He was straining, trying hard to 
understand. “Then you. .” 

“I’m all set, all ready. I’ve been 
waiting all my life for this, and now 
those stupid fools are in love with 
me and they won’t let me get on 
with it.” 

Marcus said with a sinking feel- 
ing, “It?” 

“My final assignment. Sending 
them home. It’s the simplest thing 
in the world.” She lowered thick, 
furry lashes on her cheeks and then 
looked up at him with eyes that 
were almost no color, brilliant and 
clear. “All they have to do is feed 
me into it. Zip. Mission accom- 
pished, and they’re on their way 
back home.” 

“And you . .” 

“Atomized.” She seemed to glow. 
“Think of me in the breeze, in the 
air all around. IPs beautiful.” Strok- 
ing the spider meditatively, she went 
on. “But they won’t do it, because 
Garth and Rammy and Togl have 
all fallen in love with me — and 
they’re all bigger than Seth.” She 

58 



leaned forward. “That’s why I need 
your help.” 

“Help?” 

“Complete my mission. Go into 
the — machine. Listen, say yes, and 
I’ll tell you the plan.” 

Appalled, Marcus came to his 
feet. “I don’t want to hear your 
plan. Listen, when the conjunction is 
over, I want you to come back. I’d 
like you to come live with me.” He 
waved his hands desperately. “PH 
marry you.” 

“Then you won’t help?” 

“How could I help, when it means 
your destruction and you’re so . .” 
She cut him off. “That’s my 
trouble,” she said with a sigh. “Ev- 
eryone falls in love with me. Well, 
good-by.” 

“Don’t say good-by,” he said be- 
cause he coudn’t help himself. “Say 
I’ll be seeing you.” 

“I won't be seeing you if I can 
help it,” she said with a sniff. “This 
is the last night of the conjunction, 
and I’m going to find a way into 
that machine.” 

He reached out, wanting to stop 
her. But she had gathered the spider 
and the salamanders and a hoptoad 
he hadn’t even noticed until that 
moment. With a lovely, doomed 
wave she disappeared. 

N ot even the sports page 
could hold his interest after 
that. He went listlessly through the 
routine of the day, bored by calcu- 
lus, dreaming over topology, seeing 
only her face, tenuous and chang- 
ing, in all the convolutions of the 
problem in front of him. 

He found himself watching the 

IF 




dust-ruffle hopefully. He almost 
wished he would bump into a giant 
cockroach in the pantry and was 
frankly disappointed when he shook 
out his pillow-case at bedtime and 
the blacksnake was not there. He 
watched the house across the valley 
for what seemed like hours, until his 
eye was almost frozen to the eye- 
piece of the telescope. This time he 
was awake when the blue glow 
showed itself in the window, faint at 
first and then brighter, finally blind- 
ing, dizzying. He saw wSeth hurrying 
back and forth, serving it. 

As he watched the cars pulled up 
— one for Garth, one for Togl, one 
for Rammy. He saw Seth go to the 
door to let them in. The three hulk- 
ing aliens pushed wide the door, 
which Marcus noticed did not seem 
to have a handle, and swaggered in. 
As he watched they advanced on 
the fourth figure — Seth — in rising 
excitement and wrath. 

Then he saw the woman, Mavra, 
rushing out of nowhere. At the sight 
of the sweep of her hair and the 
curve of her back he could no long- 
er contain himself. He rushed out of 
the house and into the tar, still in 
his pajamas, and hurled the car 
along the country roads, finding the 
house across the valley as surely as 
if he had been rehearsing that wild 
drive all his adult life. Blazing, ter- 
rified by the idea that she might suc- 
ceed this time, and exist no more, 
he flung himself at the front door 
of the house. 

It opened easily. “Mr. Justice,” 
she said, more beautiful even than 
he had remembered her. “Fm so 
glad you came.” 



In the background, the three men 
were wrangling with Seth. 

“I had to come — I had — ” 
“You had to help me.” Her eyes 
were shimmering with gratitude. 
“Now if you’ll just keep the others 
out of my way, Seth will — ” 

He was almost choked by ur- 
gency. “Help you, hell! I came to 
stop you. Which one is Seth?” 
“You’ve come to help us, then.” A 
tall, craggy, rock-pile of a man ad- 
vanced. 

“That’s Garth,” the girl whispered 
giving Marcus a little push. “And 
Togl and Rammy behind. The de- 
termined one — that’s Seth.” 

“You think as we do.” Almost 
tearful with gratitude, Rammy 
joined Garth. “We’ve got to make 
Seth see that he just can’t do it.” 
In the background Seth glowered, 
recalcitrant. And at his back was 
the source of the blue glow, an im- 
mense, amorphous, brilliant being, a 
power, a devourer, crouched and 
waiting in the space where the din- 
ing alcove had once been. 

“It comes alive during the con- 
junctions,” Garth said in a whisper. 
“Once the Catalyst goes in, some- 
body back home throws a switch.” 
The being flickered at first, get- 
ting brighter and brighter as Mar- 
cus watched. He saw that it could 
not move of itself, that it was just 
waiting, and he resolved to do ev- 
erything in his power to keep Seth 
from letting the girl to it. 

Rammy and Togl arrayed them- 
selves on either side of Marcus, re- 
enforcing him. “You can’t do it, 
Seth,” they said as one. 

“You can’t do it, Seth,” said 



RESCUE MISSION 



59 




Garth, in the lead. ‘This man from 
outside, he says you can’t do it.” 

“Of course he does!” Seth hissed 
at him. “He knows we’re here on re- 
connaissance. Do you think he 
wants us to go home and give our 
report?”' 

“I come as a friend,” Marcus said 
a little sententiously. “And as a 
friend I must beg . 

Seth snorted unpleasantly. 
“Friend, hell. Alien. He thinks we’re 
spies.” 

“Never mind what he thinks,” 
Rammy said nervously. “Listen to 
what he says.^^ 

“The conjunction is almost over. 
We have to hurry home!” 

“What is home, if Mavra dies?” 
Garth was almost in tears. 

Rammy said, “Mavra, the beau- 
tiful.” 

Togl added, “Mavra, our love.” 

“Love, hell,” Seth said. “She 
knows her job.” 

“Look man,” Marcus said, wish- 
ing he were a little better at per- 
suasion. “Our decency, our common 
humanity ...” and then he broke 
off, wailing, “You just can’t. I’m in 
love with her.” 



“You fool!” Seth spat. And then 
he turned and the others turned 
with him, to see that Mavra, taking 
advantage of their confusion, had 
slipped into the dining alcove, tip- 
ping Seth a little wink as she went. 
Now, with a gallant little wave, she 
was disappearing into the bowels of 
the blue glow, the being, the center 
of the machine. 

A s she connected there was a 
flash like a shower of flaming 
needles. Marcus reeled, without 
sight, without blood or breath for an 
excruciating second. When he re- 
covered, gasping, he saw that the 
others were changing; Garth, Togl 
and Rammy facing him in a lumin- 
ous brilliance, Seth flaming dutiful- 
ly, facing the spot where the being 
or machine had been, all three al- 
ready on their way home. 

Caught in the agony of passage, 
they incandesced. 

“We’ve been had,” Garth said 
mournfully, just as he and the others 
flickered and went out. 

And Marcus, in his pajamas, was 
alone, in the cold and deserted room.

TRACKS 

by ROBERT E. MARGROFF 



Never trust an Alien! When 
they are most defenseless^ 
they're most totally deadlyl 



T he Alien Alert sounded while 
Rohan was sitting down with 
his Uncle Spadler to his first meal 
of venison. Uncle Spadler had just 
cut himself a bite-size chunk of rare 
steak. The fork, with the meat spit- 
ted upon it, wavered before the gran- 
ite chin and the dark red, extremely 
bushy mustache. 

Three times the eerie sound tor- 
mented the chilly mountain air. Six- 
ty seconds passed — the silence weigh- 
ing like heavy heartbeats — three 
times again, the wail. 

All was quiet inside and outside 
the isolated cabin. Rohan’s boyish 
lips trembled. 

‘T — I thought I heard something 
outside, Uncle.” 

“You what?** 

“I thought I heard a noise out- 
side, Uncle.” 



Uncle Spadler’s eyes gleamed. He 
rose from the table and crossed the 
cabin to the gun rack. He plucked 
one of the two sporting rifles from 
its magnetic holder. He yanked back 
the rifle bolt, three, four, six times. 

Expelled deer slugs made click- 
ing sounds as they hit the floor. 
Uncle Spadler took some high ex- 
plosive killer shells from a greea 
box. Snip, snip, snip went the shellf 
into the rifle’s magazine. 

Rohan gripped the edge of the 
table hard as he watched his uncle 
cross the floor with the gun in his 
hands. His breath sucked in as, gua 
resting with the stock steady against 
his hip. Uncle Spadler threw the 
door open. 

Wind rushed in, cold and snow- 
filled. Flakes fell to the floor, melt- 
ing like human consciences. 



61 




Uncle Spadler moved through 
the doorway. His broad back dis- 
appeared from view, and for a mo- 
ment there was an open square of 
dusk-filled daylight. Then he had 
backed inside again. 

“What is it, Uncle?” Rohan 
gasped, 

Spadler did not answer. He closed 
the door silently. Then he whirled, 
heavy, huge and bear-like. He faced 
Rohan at close-quarters, and he said, 
in a voice like thunder, “Tracks out- 
side.” 

“Alien?” 

“Alien.” 

“Big ones?” 

“Big ones.” 

R ohan shuddered. He stirred not 
a leg nor an arm while his 
uncle moved about the cabin. From 
behind him he heard. “Hurry up! 
Get ready now! We’ve got a job to 
do.” 

“But I—” 

His uncle’s face was before him, 
glowering red with rage. “A job, I 
say! You too, as well as I.” 

“But—” 

“Here!” And Uncle Spadler thrust 
into his hands a wadded bundle of 
outdoor clothing. 

He took the rifle and the extra 
flashlight his uncle handed him. He 
moved to the door. He put on the 
snowshoes. • 

“The tracks are over there,” said 
Uncle Spadler, pointing through the 
snowstorm. “Big flat ones, like noth- 
ing I ever saw before.” 

Rohan stared. He moved the way 
his uncle had directed him. 

The track was shaped roughly 



like a human’s. Twelve feet ahead 
of the track there was another one, 
and twelve feet further on, another. 
Each track was positioned one di- 
rectly ahead and behind another, in 
a way that no animal — human or 
otherwise — should normally walk. 

“There’s many different kinds of 
Aliens.” Rohan’s voice was hoarse. 
“Aren’t there. Uncle?” 

“Many, many kinds,” said Uncle 
Spadler. 

“And you’ve never seen this kind 
of track before?” 

“I told you I hadn’t!” 

“And you never heard of an Alien 
that makes this kind?” 

“Never!” 

“It must want to live very badly 
to escape prison camp and attempt 
to cross a hunting area.” 

Rohan raised a hand encased in 
a shooting glove to his forehead. 
Through the skin-tight plastic, his 
fingers could just detect the hair- 
like line upon his forehead. “So 
long,” he said wonderingly. “So 
very long! All that dark and the 
wetness. Half dead, half knowing. 
Angel voices. The rustle of a 
nurse’s gown. Soft hiss of a nutrient 
supply tube.” 

“Are you re-living that again?” 
said his uncle. 

“Yes,” said Rohan. 

“Stop it!” his uncle said brutally. 
“But—” 

“It’s ten years since your broken 
body was put in the re-growth tank. 
You’ve been out of the hospital two 
years. Long enough. I’d think.” 

“But, Uncle Spadler, when I was 
little . .” 

“What?” 



62 



IF 




‘‘Before all the trouble . 

“Out with it!” 

“I — I thought everyone liked 
Aliens.” 

Spadler’s face moved close to his. 
Snow flecked the bushy eyebrows. 
“You stupid, boy?” 

“N-no, I don’t think so.” 

“After those souvenirs from 
‘friendly’ — ” contempt reversed 
meaning — “Aliens started explod- 
ing and killing people . after 
‘tourists’ produced weapons and 
started killing people . after ‘tame’ 
house-pets began blinding and poi- 
soning people . after all that, you 
still think there’s good in Aliens?” 
“S-some Aliens, perhaps.” 

“Bah!” said Uncle Spadler. 

Rohan looked down at his right 
snowshoe, then at the giant track in 
front of it. He swallowed. He did 
not contradict his uncle. 

“You have a rifle there,” Uncle 
Spadler said, 

“Yes,” Rohan said. 

“That gun will stop any Alien that 
you have to stop with it.” 

“I’m glad it will,” Rohan said. 
“C’mon, then!” 

Rohan looked up to see his uncle 
moving off into the snowstorm. His 
lips twisted. He drew cold air into 
his lungs, then expelled a cloud of 
white vapor. Taking a firm grim on 
the gun, he followed his uncle. 

H is legs were a dull ache as morn- 
ing approached. 

By then it had long since quit 
snowing. The stars were beginning 
to fade, and still they had not seen 
the Alien. 

Uncle Spadler pointed at the 



nearest track with his now turned 
off flashlight. “See, it stood here for 
a while. Resting, maybe thinking up 
some devilment. It knows part of it* 
advantage is gone in the daylight.** 
“The tracks head for the woodsy 
Uncle,” Rohan said. 

Uncle Spadler moved that way. 
“Be alert now,” he said. “It could 
be preparing an ambush.” 

“Do they do that ofteil Uncle?** 
“Some do,” said Uncle Spadler. 
Rohan frowned. His eyes water- 
ed. His fingernails tried to dig 
through his gloves and into his rifle 
stock. 

At the edge of the forest, Uncle 
Spadler dropped his flashlight. He 
did not bother to pick it up. 
“Uncle?” 

Spadler pointed. Ahead, one track 
mark stood out plainly beneath a 
low-hanging tree limb. 

“It’s a low place for it to have 
stood, isn’t it, Uncle?” 

“The thing hops,” Uncle Spadler 
said. 

“Perhaps it’s not so big as it 
looks.” 

“Perhaps not. That doesn’t mean 
it’s any less dangerous.” 

Rohan swallowed as he peered in- 
to the woods. “So many bushes — > 
it could hide anywhere, couldn’t it?” 
“It’s too rough to wear snow- 
shoes. We’ll have to wait until the 
sun is all the way up before we go 
in.” 

“And that will give it still more of 
a chance, won’t it. Uncle?” 

“Shut up!” said Uncle Spadler. 

A bent branch sprang back and 
wrapped itself around the calf

of Uncle Spadler’s right leg. Uncle 
Spadler screamed. Then he stopped 
screaming and swore lividly. 

Hurrying to his uncle’s side, Ro- 
han saw a row of needle-like thorns 
protruding from the top half of his 
uncle’s combat boot. 

‘‘Didn’t penetrate through the 
boot leather,” Uncle Spadler said at 
last. “You can bet I’d be dead if 
they had.” 

“Poison?” 

Uncle Spadler pointed at a yel- 
lowish, all but invisible mucus on 
one of the thorns. He was careful 
not to touch it. “That’s poison of 
some kind. The Alien we’re tracking 
is probably venomous.” 

“We’d better get those thorns 
out,” Rohan said concernedly. He 
searched in a pocket and found a 
pair of pliers. Carefully, so as to 
avoid touching the mucus, he began 
pulling the thorns. 

When he had pulled three thorns, 
he stopped in astonishment. “Uncle, 
some of these thorns — they’ve got 
barbs on them!” 

“Hold one up where I can sec,” 
said Uncle Spadler. 

Rohan held up the pliers. 

“Small,” said Uncle Spadler. 
“That means a delicate touch, 
doesn’t it? Probably real small mani- 
pulating appendages?” 

“Hurry up with those thorns.” 
“Uncle, could there be a big Alien 
carrying a small Alien?” 

“Hurry up, I said.” 

Rohan pulled the last of the 
thorns. He straightened up and saw 
his uncle’s eyes were directed at a 
bush in back of him. 

“I’m going over there,” said his 



uncle. “You stay here and watch for 
me.” 

“All right. Uncle.” 

Rohan stood in the snow and 
watched his uncle advance on the 
bush. His head swiveled right and 
left; his eyes tried to see every- 
where. 

Uncle Spadler reached the bushes. 
He maneuvered around the edges. 
He waved for Rohan to keep back. 
Then he disappeared from sight be- 
hind some tree trunks. 

Seconds lengthened into minutes. 
Minutes dragged interminably. 

Suddenly Rohan’s hands tightened 
convulsively on his rifle. His eyelids 
stretched. He opened his mouth 
wide, but no sound came. 

From a different direction then 
the one his uncle had taken, there 
had come a thing — a bunny rabbit 
thing, with fur that was softly glow- 
ing. A thing without visible legs, 
that hopped twelve feet at a time 
in a staight line toward him. 

T he rifle flew to Rohan’s shoul- 
der, drawn there by hours of 
drill and practice. “H-halt, Alien!” 
he said. 

The Alien halted. It raised babyish 
pink hands before its wrinkled face. 
Violet eyes stared liquidly upwards. 
It spoke: 

“Oh, Being of Many Thunders,” 
it said in a surprisingly strong, 
scarcely accented voice. “Oh, Mas- 
ter of Space, Son of Conqueror of 
Worlds — ” 

Rohan yelled loudly for his Uncle 
Spadler. Only the stillness of the for- 
est answered him. 

“Oh, Sentient Creature a Million 



64 



IF 




Times my Superior. Oh, Man, this 
Worthless Nonentity is Vastly 
Pleased that you have come for me.” 
“W-what do you mean?” 

Violet eyes rolled. The creature 
gave off a scent like springtime 
flowers. A sound came from its body 
which was both lulling and stirring 
at the same time and might well 
have been the opening chord in 
some grand Alien symphony. 

“On Far World of My Origin, I 
Live, Work, and One Day Honored. 
Entertainers I, Most Honored of 
Profession. Conquerors Come, but 
not you Conquerors. Conquerors 
want Entertainers. I am Honored.” 
“You mean,” Rohan swallowed, 
“you were a non-combatant? One 
of a race conquered by other 
Aliens?” 

“Non-Combatant I,” talked-sang 
the Alien. “I not Escape From 
Camp. I ordered From. I told Test 
Man’s Tracking ability. I do . Not 
Want.” 

“Who ordered you?” 

“Mans at Camp. Guards say Hop 
Fast. Say where go. Say Man Re- 
warded Find me.” 

“Uncle Spadler!” Rohan called. 
Stillness. 

“I can’t believe what you say! It 
can’t be the way Ihings happen. You 
tried to kill my uncle.” 

“No, No, Not Do! I try Catch 
Food. You come. I Fear. Not Want 
Kill; Not want. Hurt. You Million 
Times my Superior.” 

Suddenly, the music Alien played 
took on a dirge-like quality. The 
pinkish face bent over its cupped 
hands. Tears ran rather than leaked 
from the violet eyes, falling like tiny 



beads of amber Inio tlie cup that 
awaited them. 

Rohan stared. His face softened. 
He lowered his rifle. Impulsively he 
dropped to his knees in front of the 
Alien. He tossed the gun aside and 
reached for a handkerchief. 

The tears were now brimming the 
hollow formed by the hands. From 
each pink finger there clicked a long 
curved claw. The claws pointed up- 
wards, curved back from the finger- 
tips. 

Rohan found his handkerchief 
with his right hand. 

And Alien’s claws snapped out- 
wards, and amber droplets filled the 
air. 

I nstinctively Rohan’s eyes squeezed 
shut. His left forearm raised, his 
head dropped. 

From the bushes, a rifle cracked. 
A killer shell exploded. Stuff hit 
Rohan’s raised forearm. Rohan was 
hurled backwards. 

Rohan’s eyes opened. 

“It tried to get me too,” someone 
said. “It thought it led me into a 
deadfall, but I avoided it.” 

Rohan turned to see his Uncle 
Spadler. His mouth worked. “B-but, 
Uncle, it was so h-helpless,” he said. 
“Take a look at your coat!” 
Rohan looked at his left coat 
sleeve. Wisps of smoke were coming 
from tiny brown holes where the 
Alien’s tears had landed. 

“Helpless as a spitting cobra.” 
Rohan’s two perfectly good eyes 
widened. In a voice hardly recogniz- 
able as his own he added: 

“And every bit as trustworthy.”

What Has Gone Before . • 



HUGH FARNHAM, bridge player and head of a grown 
family, is caught in the destruction of a sudden and devastating 
nuclear war. With his wife and children they take refuge in his 
bomb shelter, bringing with them 

BARBARA WELLS, a schoolmate of his daughter, with whom 
Farnham finds himself unexpectedly and peremptorily in love. But 
there is little time for them to dwell on their relationship, for when 
the bombs stop failing and they leave the shelter they* find them- 
selves in a world where no sign of man appears. There is no 
destruction — there is no city! They establish a primitive way of 
life, in which Farnham's chief lieutenant is the other member of 
their party, 

JOSEPH, the young Negro who was once the Farnham's 
houseboy and is now more of a son to him than his own son, Duke. 
Farnham's daughter, Karen dies in childbirth. As they are recover- 
ing from the tragedy they are visited by a fleet of strange ships 
commanded by 

PONSE, a regal and intelligent man who takes them pris- 
oner and brings them to the castle which is his home. He treats 
them with a sort of disinterested good humor, except for Joseph, 
who he makes an honored guest. It is Joseph's skin color that has 
earned him special privilege. They learn that they have fallen 
through a flaw in time and are in the world of thousands of years 
from now, where the European and American nations have all 
but destroyed themselves in nuclear war; now all power belongs 
to the unharmed Africans who have taken over and rebuilt on 
the ruins. Except for Joseph, Farnham's family group is taken 
into the community as domestic slaves. Farnham himself is turned 
over to 

MEMTOK, major-domo and chief administrator of Ponse's 
huge slave estate. They are separated and put to work. They are 
well fed and reasonably housed, but they are slaves nonethe- 
less. In captivity, Barbara bears Farnham's twin children — which 
he can never see. He determines to escape. 

But where is there to go?

every minute that he could spare, 
and always wanted the same four, 
the best players available. 

It seemed to Hugh that Their 
Charity was fond of Barbara, as 
fond as he was of the cat he called 
“Dok'livstnipsoom” — never ‘‘Doc.” 
Ponse extended to cats the courtesy 
due equals, and Doc, or any of the 
cats, was free to jump up into his 
lap even when he was bidding a dif- 
ficult hand. He extended the same 
courtesy and affection to Barbara as 
he knew her better, always called 
her “Barba,” or “Child,” and never 
again referred to her as “it.” Bar- 
bara called him “Ponse,” or “Uncle,” 
and clearly felt unafraid and happy 
in his company. 

Sometimes Ponse left Barbara and 
Hugh alone in his lounging room, 
once for more than twenty minutes. 
These were jewels beyond price; they 
did not risk losing such a privilege 
by doing more than hold hands. 

If it was time to nurse the boys, 
Barbara said so and Ponse always 
ordered them fetched up. Once he 
ordered them fetched to his lounge 
when it wasn’t necessary, said that 
he had not seen them for a week 
and wanted to see how much they 
had grown. So the game waited 
while their' “Uncle” Ponse got down 
on the rug and made foolish noises 
at them. 

Then he had them taken away. 
Five minutes of babies was enough. 
But he said to Barbara, “Child, 
they’re growing like sugar cane. I 
hope I live to see them grow up.” 

“You’ll live a long time. Uncle.” 

“Maybe. I’ve outlived a dozen 
food tasters, but that salts no fish. 



Those brats of ours will make mag- 
nificent matched footmen. I can see 
them now, serving in the banquet 
hall of the Palace — the Residence, 
I mean, not this summer cottage. 
Whose deal is it?” 

H ugh saw Grace a few times dur- 
ing this period, but never for 
more than seconds. If he showed up 
and she was there, she left at once, 
displeasure large on her face. If 
Barbara arrived for bridge before 
Hugh did, Grace was always out of 
sight. It was clear that she was an 
habituee of the lord’s informal apart- 
ments; it was equally clear that 
she resented Barbara as much as 
ever, with bile left over for Hugh. 
But she never said anything and it 
seemed likely that she had learned 
not to cross wills with Their Char- 
ity. 

It was now official that Grace 
was bedwarmer to Their Charity. 
Hugh learned this from Kitten, who 
would happily gossip about anything 
if encouraged. It appeared that the 
sluts knew when the lord was in 
residence (Hugh often did not) by 
whether Grace was downstairs or 
up. She was assigned no other duties 
and even the slutmaster did not dare 
put her to work on her days of idle- 
ness. She was immune to all whips, 
even Memtok’s. She was also, the 
few times Hugh glimpsed her, lavish- 
ly dressed and bejeweled. 

She was also very fat, so fat that 
Hugh felt relieved that he no longer 
had even a nominal obligation to 
share a bed with her. True, all bed- 
warmers were fat by Hugh’s stand- 
ards. Even kitten was plump enough 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD

that had she been a XXth century 
American girl, she would have been 
at least pretending to diet, and talk- 
ing about it. Kitten did talk about 
it. She fretted that she was unable 
to put on weight. 

Kitten was so young that her 
plumpness was somewhat pleasing, 
as with a baby. But Hugh found 
Grace’s fatness another matter. 
Somewhere in that jiggling mass was 
buried the beautiful girl he had mar- 
ried. He tried not to think about 
it and could not see why Ponse 
would like it — if he did. But in 
truth, Hugh admitted, he did not 
know that Grace was anything more 
than nominally Ponse’s bedwarmer, 
just as Kitten was to him. After all, 
Ponse was alleged to be more than 
a century old. Would Ponse have 
any more use for one than Memtok 
had? Hugh did not know — nor 
really care. Ponse looked to be per- 
haps sixty-five and still strong and 
virile. But Hugh held a private opin- 
ion that Grace’s role was odalisque, 
not houri. 

While the question did not really 
matter to him, it did to Duke. 
Hugh’s first son came storming into 
Hugh’s office one day and demand- 
ed a private interview; Hugh led him 
to his apartment. He had not seen 
Duke in nearly a month. Satisfactory 
translations had been coming in 
from him; there had been no need 
to see him. 

H ugh tried to make the meeting 
pleasant. “Sit down, Duke. May 
I offer you a drink of Happiness?” 
“No, thanks! What’s this I hear 
about Mother?” 



“What do you hear, Duke?” (Oh, 
Lord! Here we go again.) 

“You know damned well what I 
mean!” 

“I’m afraid I don’t.” 

Hugh made him spell it out, of- 
fering no help. Duke had his facts 
correct and, to Hugh’s surprise, had 
learned them just that day. Since 
every one of more than four hun- 
dred servants had known all along 
that one of the slut savages — the 
other one, not the tall skinny one 
— lived upstairs with Their Charity 
more than she lived in the sluts’ 
quarters, it seemed incredible that 
Duke had taken so long to find out. 
However, Duke had very little to 
do with the other servants and was 
not popular with them — “a trouble- 
maker,” Memtok had called him. 

Hugh neither confirmed nor de- 
nied Duke’s story. 

“Well?” Duke demanded. “What 
are you going to do about it?” 
“About what, Duke? Are you sug- 
gesting that I put a stop to servants’ 
hall gossip? I doubt if I could. My 
usual practice is to ignore it.” 

“I don’t mean that at all! Are 
you going to sit there while your 
wife is being raped?” 

“Probably. You come in here with 
some story you’ve picked up from 
a second assistant dishwasher, or 
some equally reliable source, and ex- 
pect me to do something. Now, I 
would like to know, first, why do 
you think this gossip is true? Second, 
what has what you have told me 
got to do with rape? Third, if all 
or any of it were true, what would 
you expect me to do about it? 
Fourth, what, if anything, do you

IF 




think I can do about it? Take them 
in order and please be specific. 
Then we may talk about what I will 
do.’^ 

“Quit twisting things around.” 
“Tm not twisting anything. You 
are. Duke, you had an expensive 
education as a lawyer — I know, I 
picked up the tab. You used to lec- 
ture me about ‘rules of evidence.* 
Now use some of that education. 
Take those questions in order. Why 
do you think this gossip is true?** 
“Uh ... I heard it and I checked 
around. Everybody knows it.’* 

“So? Everybody knew the Earth 
was flat, at one time. They were 
wrong. But what is the allegation? 
Be specific.” 

“Why, I told you. Mother is as- 
signed as that bastard’s bedwarmer.** 
“Who says so?” 

“Why, everybody!’* 

“Did you ask the slutmaster?” 
“Do you think Fm crazy?” 

“Fll take that as rhetorical. But 
to shorten this, what ‘everybody 
knows’ as you put it, is that Grace 
is assigned duties of some sort, up- 
stairs. This seems possible and no 
doubt could be verified, one way or 
the other. Possibly in attendance on 
Their Charity, possibly waiting on 
the ladies of the household, or per- 
haps other duties. Do you want me 
to arrange an appointment for you 
with the slutmaster, so that you can 
ask him what duties your mother 
has? I tell you truthfully that I do 
not know her duties.” 

“Uh, you ask him.” 

“I shan’t. I feel sure that, if I did 
ask, Grace would regard it as snoop- 
ing on my part. Let’s assume for 



the moment that you have asked 
him and that he has told you, as 
you now suspect only from gossip, 
that her assignment is as bedwarmer. 
To Their Charity. On this assump- 
tion, made for the sake of argument 
only, since you certainly haven’t 
proved it — on this assumption, 
where does rape come in?” 

D uke looked astonished. “I would 
not have believed it, even of 
you. Do you mean to sit there and 
say baldly ttiat you think Mother 
would do such a thing voluntarily?^^ 
“I long ago gave up trying to 
guess what your mother would or 
would not do. But / haven’t said she 
is doing anything. You have. I don’t 
know that her assignment is bed- 
warmer other than through gossip, 
gossip which you have repeated 
without proof. If true, I still would 
not know if she had ever carried 
out the assignment by actually get- 
ting into his bed, voluntarily or 
otherwise — I’ve never seen his bed 
nor even heard gossip on this point 
. just your evil thoughts. But if 
those thoughts are correct, I still 
would have no opinion as to whether 
or not anything other than sleep had 
taken place. I myself, over the 
course of years, have shared beds 
with more than one female and did 
nothing but sleep; I know it can 
happen. But in any event I doubt 
very strongly that Their Charity has 
ever raped any female in all his long 
life. I doubt it especially now. Never 
mind. I see only one way to get at 
the facts, if any, underlying these 
foul suspicions in your mind. Ask 
the Lord Protector.” 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



71 




“Go nghi ahead! First sensible 
thing vou’ve said.” 

“Oh, not me. Duke. You see, I 
don’t even faintly suspect him of 
rape. But you can ask him. Simply 
see the Chief Domestic. You don’t 
have to go through me to see Mem- 
tok; you know his policy. He’ll see 
any Palace servant who wants to 
see him. At the servant’s risk, of 
course, but I doubt if he’ll tingle 
anyone in my department without 
good cause; I do have some fat cat 
privileges. Tell him you want an 
audience with the Lord Protector. 
I think that is all it will take, al- 
though you may have to wait a week 
or two. If Memtok turns you down, 
tell me. I fancy I can get him to 
arrange it Then, when you see the 
Lord Protector, simply ask him, 
point blank.” 

“And be lied to. If I ever get that 
close to that black ape. I’m going 
to kill him!” 

Mr. Farnham sighed. “Duke, I 
don’t see how can man can be so 
wrong-headed so many different 
ways. If you are granted an audi- 
ence, Memtok will be right at your 
side. With his whip. The Lord Pro- 
tector will probably be about fifty 
feet away. And the whip he carries 
doesn’t just tingle; it’s a deadly 
weapon. Very. The old man has liv- 
ed a long time, he’s not easy to 
kill.” 

“I can try!” 

“So you can. If a grasshopper 
tries to fight a lawnmower, one may 
admire his courage but not respect 
his judgment. But you are equally 
sDly in thinking that Their Charity 
would lie about it. If he has done 



what you think he has — raped your 
mother, forced her to submit un- 
willingly — he would feel not the 
slightest shame, not in any way re- 
luctant to answer you plainly and 
honestly. Duke, he would no more 
bother to lie to you than it would 
occur to him to step aside if you 
were in his way. However — would 
you believe your mother?” 

“Of course I would.” 

(^'T^hen tell him also that you 
A would like to see her. I am 
almost certain that he would grant 
the request. For a few minutes and 
in his presence. The strict harem 
rules he can break if he chooses. If 
you have the guts to tell him to his 
face that you want to hear her con- 
firm whatever he tells you, I think 
he would be astonished. But I think 
he would then laugh and grant the 
petition. If you want to see your 
mother, assure yourself personally 
of her welfare and safety, that’s all 
I can suggest. You certainly can’t 
see her otherwise. It’s so irregular 
that your only chance is to spring 
it on him, face to face.” 

Hugh stood up. "We’ve wasted 
enough time in futile talk. Either get 
back to work, or go see Memtok.” 
“I’m not through.” 

“Oh, yes, you are. That was an 
order, not a suggestion. Do one or 
the other, and do it now.” 

“If you think I’m scared of that 
whip — ” 

“Oh, heavens, Duke, I wouldn’t 
tingle you myself. You’re my son, it 
might restrain me. If you ever force 
me to it, I’ll ask Memtok to chastise 
you. He’s reputed to be quite ex-

IF 




pert. Now get out. You’ve wasted 
half my morning.” 

Duke left. Hugh stayed a while, 
trying to compose himself. A row 
with Duke always left him shaking 
inside; it had been so when the lad 
was only twelve. But something else 
troubled him, too. He had used 
every sophistry he could think of to 
divert Duke from a hopeless course. 
That did not worry him, nor did he 
share Duke’s basic worry. Whatever 
had happened to Grace, he felt sure 
that rape was not a factor. 

But he was sourly aware of some- 
thing that Duke, in his delusions, 
apparently did not realize — the old- 
est Law of the Conquered, that their 
women eventually submit — willing- 

ly. 

Whether his ex-wife had or had 
not was a matter almost academic. 
He suspected that she had never 
been offered the opportunity — but, 
either way, she was obviously con- 
tented with her lot — smug about it. 
That troubled him little; he had 
tried to do his duty by her, she had 
long since withdrawn herself from 
him. But he did not want Barbara 
ever to feel the deadening load of 
hopelessness that could — and had, 
all through history — turned chaste 
women into willing concubines. 

Much as he loved her, he had no 
illusions that Barbara was either 
angel or saint. The Sabine women 
had stood no chance and in the long 
run, neither would she. “Death be- 
fore dishonor!” was a fine slogan, 
but it did not wear well. In time, 
enough time, it changed to happy 
cooperation. 

He got out his bottle of Happiness, 



looked at it . put it back. He 
would never solve his problems that 
way. 

H ugh made no effort to find out 
whether or not Duke had gone 
to see Memtok. Hugh got back to 
work, that day and following days, at 
his endless task of buttering up Their 
Charity in every way available to 
him, whether by good bridge, mon- 
eymaking ideas, or simply translat- 
ing. He no longer had any real hope 
that the boss would eventually per- 
mit him to move Barbara and the 
twins into his comfortable apart- 
ment; old Ponse seemed adamant on 
that point. But favor at court could 
be useful, even indispensable, no 
matter what happened — and in the 
meantime it let him see Barbara oc- 
casionally. 

He never gave up his end purpose 
of escape. As the summer wore on 
he realized that the chances were 
very slim indeed of escaping — all 
four of them escaping, twins in 
arms — that year. Soon the house- 
hold would move to the city, and so 
far as he knew the only possible 
time to escape was when they were 
near mountains. No matter. A year, 
two years, even longer, perhaps even 
wait until the boys could walk. Hard 
enough even then, but very nearly 
impossible with babies in arms. He 
must tell Barbara, with whispered 
urgency, the very next time they 
were left alone even for a minute, 
what he had in mind — urge her to 
keep her chin up, and wait. 

He didn’t dare write it in his 
nightly notes to her. Ponse could 
get them translated — other scholars

somewhere understood English, even 
though Joe would never give him 
away. Would Grace? He hoped not, 
but couldn’t guess. Probably Ponse 
knew all about these notes, had them 
translated every day, chuckled over 
them, and did not care. 

Perhaps he could work out a 
code with Barbara — something as 
simple as first word, first line, then 
second word, second line, and so on. 
Might risk it. 

He had figured out one thing in 
their favor, an advantage that might 
overcome their sad luck of sophis- 
tication in this society. It was evi- 
dent that runaways rarely succeeded 
because of their appearance. A white 
skin might be disguised — but ser- 
vants average many inches shorter 
and many pounds lighters than the 
Chosen. 

Both Barbara and Hugh were 
above average height for their own 
time; they were big enough to pass 
in that respect for Chosen. Features? 
The Chosen were not uniform in 
feature; Hindu influence mixed with 
Negroid and with other things. His 
permanent baldness was a problem, 
he would have to steal a wig. Or 
make one. But with stolen clothes, 
squirreled food, weapons of some 
sort (his two hands!), and makeup 
— they might be able to pass for 
“poor black trash” and safely take 
to the road. 

If it wasn’t too far. If the hounds 
did not get them. If they did not 
make some ridiculous bumble 
through not knowing the customs. 
But servants, marked by their com- 
plexion, were not allowed to go one 
step outside the household, farm. 



ranch, or whatever was their lawful 
cage — without a pass from their 
patron. 

Perhaps he could learn what a 
pass looked like, forge one. No, that 
was useless. Barbara and he could 
not travel as servants on a forged 
pass for the very reasons that made 
it dimly possible for them to dis- 
guise as Chosen: Their size was too 
distinctive, a pickup call for them 
would be carried out on sight. 

T he more Hugh thought about it 
the more it seemed to him that 
he would have to wait at least until 
the next summer and then make a 
quick run for the mountains. 

If they were among the servants 
picked for the Summer Palace next 
year — if they both were — if all 
four were — He had not thought of 
that angle. Christ! Their little fam- 
ily might never be all under this 
one roof again. Perhaps they would 
have to run for it, right here, right 
now, in the short time left before 
the move — run and take a chance 
on hounds, on bears, on those nasty 
little leopards . with two nursing 
babies to protect. God! Was ever 
a man faced with poorer chances 
for saving his family? 

Yes. He himself had been — when 
he built that shelter. 

Prepare every way he could . 
and pray for a miracle. He started 
saving food from meals served in 
his rooms, such sorts as would keep 
a while. He kept his eyes open to 
steal a knife — or anything that 
could be made into a knife. He care- 
fully kept what he was doing from 
Kitten’s eyes.

IF 





Not once did he consider starting 
out some night alone. 

Much sooner than he had hoped 
he got a chance to acquire makeup. 
A feast day always meant an orgy 
of Happiness in servants’ hall; one 
came along that featured amateur 
theatricals. Hugh was urged to clown 
the part of Lord Protector in a 
comic skit. He did not hesitate to 
do so. Memtok himself had pointed 
out that his size made him perfect 
for the part. Hugh roared through 
it, brandishing a quirt three times as 
big as Their Charity ever carried. 

He was a dramatic success. He 
saw Ponse watching the fun from 
the balcony from which Hugh had 
first seen Happiness issued, watch- 
ing and laughing.“So Hugh ad-libbed, 
calling out, “Hey, less noise up theiol 
Memtok! Tingle that critter!” 



Their Charity laughed harder 
than ever, the servants were almost 
hysterical and, at bridge the follow- 
ing day, Ponse patted him and told 
him that he was the best Lord of 
Nonsense that the pageant had ever 
had. 

Result: one stolen package of pig- 
ment which needed only to be mixed 
with the plentiful deodorant cream 
to be makeup as good as Max Factor 
ever sold to make him the exact 
shade of the Lord Protector; one 
wig which covered his baldness with 
black wavy hair. It was not the wig 
he had worn in the skit; he had turn- 
ed that one back to the chief house- 
keeper, picking a time under Mem- 
tok’s eyes and urging Memtok to try 
it on to see how it would look. No, 
it was a wig he had tried on out of 
several saved from year to year — 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD

and which had fitted him just as 
well. He tried it on, dropped it, 
kicked it into a corner, recovered it 
in private — and kept it hidden 
under his robe for several days until 
it seemed certain that it hadn’t been 
missed. Then it wound up under a 
heavy file case in his outer office 
one night when he chose to work 
later than his clerks. 

He was still looking for something 
he could grind into a knife. 

H e did not see Duke during the 
three weeks following their 
row. Sometimes Duke’s translations 
came in, sometimes he skipped a 
day or two; Hugh let him get away 
with it. But when Hugh could not 
recall having seen any scrolls come 
through of the sort Duke was con- 
cerned with for a full week, Hugh 
decided that he ought to check up. 
Eventually Ponse might notice; Duke 
might get into trouble. Or get Hugh 
into trouble. 

Hugh walked around to the com- 
bined study and bedroom that was 
Duke’s privilege for being a “re- 
searcher in history.” He scratched 
on the door — no answer. 

He scratched again, decided that 
Duke was sleeping, or not in; he 
slid the door up and looked in. 

Duke was not asleep but he was 
out of this world. He was sprawled 
naked on his bunk in the most all- 
out Happiness jag Hugh had ever 
seen. Duke looked up when the door 
opened, giggled foolishly, made a 
wide gesture, and said, “Hiyah, y’ole 
bas’ard! How’s tricks?” 

Hugh stepped closer for a better 
look at what he thought he saw and 



felt sick at his stomach. “Son, son!” 
“Still crepe-hanging, Hughie? Old 
hooey Hugh!” 

Gulping, Hugh started to back 
out, and backed almost into the 
Chief Veterinarian. The surgeon 
smiled and said, “Visiting my pat- 
ient? He hardly needs it.” He moved 
past Hugh with a muttered apology, 
leaned over Duke, peeled an eyelid 
back, examined him in other ways, 
said to him jovially, “You’re doing 
fine, cousin. Let’s give you another 
treatment, then I’ll send you in an- 
other big meal. How does that 
sound?” 

“Jus’ fine. Doc. Jus’ dandy! 
You’re my frien’. Best frien’ never 
had!” 

The vet set a dial on a little in- 
strument, pressed it against Duke’s 
thigh, waited a moment, and came 
out. He smiled at Hugh. “Practi- 
cally recovered. He’ll dream a few 
hours now, wake up very hungry, 
and not know any time has passed. 
Then we’ll feed him and give him 
another dose. A fine patient, he’s 
rallied beautifully. Doesn’t know 
what’s happened. And by the time 
we’re ready to taper him off, he 
won’t be interested.” 

^‘Who ordered this?** 

The surgeon looked surprised. 
“The Chief Domestic, of course. 
Why?” 

“Why wasn’t I told?” 

“I really don’t know, better ask 
him. I got it as a routine order, we 
carried it out in the routine fashion.

tranquil. It tends to make some of 
them a little nervous at first, we 
vary it to suit- the patient. But, as 
you can see, this patient has taken it 
as easily as pulling a tooth. By the 
way, that bridge I installed in your 
mouth. Satisfactory?” 

“What? Yes. Never mind that! 
I want to know — ” 

“May it please you, the Chief 
Domestic is the one to see. Now, if 
this one may be excused, Fm over- 
due to hold sick call. I merely stop- 
ped by to make sure my patient 
was happy.” 

Hugh let him go, then went to 
his apartment and threw up. Then 
he went looking for Memtok. 

M emtok seemed pleased to see 
him, received him into his of- 
fice at once, invited him to sit down. 
Hugh had begun to value the Chief 
Domestic as a friend, or as the near- 
est thing he had to a friend below 
stairs. Memtok had formed a habit 
of dropping in on Hugh in the 
evenings occasionally and, despite 
the boss servant’s vinegary approach 
to life and the vast difference in 
their backgrounds and values, Hugh 
found him shrewd and always stimu- 
lating and extremely well informed 
within his limits. Besides Memtok 
seemed to have the loneliness that 
a ship’s captain must endure; he 
seemed pleased to relax and enjoy 
friendship. 

Since the other upper servants 
were correctly polite with the Chief 
Researcher rather than warm, Hugh, 
lonesome himself, had enjoyed Mem- 
tok’s unbending and had thought of 
him as his friend. Until this — 



Hugh told Memtok bluntly, with- 
out protocol, what was on his mind. 
“Why did you do this?” 

Memtok looked surprised. “Such 
a question! Such a very improper 
question, in fact. Because the Lord 
Protector ordered it.” 

“He did?^* 

“My dear cousin! Tempering is 
always by the lord’s order. Oh, I 
recommend, to be sure; that’s rou- 
tine. But orders for alterations must 
come from above. However, if it is 
any business of yours, in this case 
I made no recommendation. I was 
simply given the order, I had it car- 
ried out. All.” 

“Certainly it was my business! He 
works for me.” 

“Oh! But he had already been 
transferred before this was done. 
Else I would have made a point of 
telling you, believe me. Propriety, 
cousin, propriety in all things. I 
hold subordinates strictly account- 
able, as you know. So I never under- 
cut them. Can’t run a taut household 
if one does. Fair is fair.” 

“/ wasn’t told he was transferred. 
Don’t you count that as undercut- 
ting?” 

“Oh, but you were.” The Chief 
Domestic glanced at the enormous 
rack of pigeon holes backing his 
desk, searched briefly, pulled out a 
slip. “There it is.” 

Hugh looked at it. “Duty Assign- 
ment. Change In. One servant, male 
(savage, rescued & adopted), known 
as Duke, description — ” Hugh skip- 
ped on down. “ — relieved of all 
duties in the Department of Ancient 
History and assigned to the personal

ther—” 

‘‘I never saw this!” 

“No, it’s my file copy. You got 
the original.” Memtok pointed at the 
lower left corner. “Your deputy 
clerk’s sign. It always pleases me 
when my executive can read and 
write, it makes things so much more 
orderly. With an ignoramus like the 
Chief Groundskeeper, one can tell 
him until one’s throat is raw and 
later the stupid lout will claim that 
wasn’t the way he heard it — yet a 
good tingling improves his memory 
only for that one day. Disheartening. 
One can’t be forever tingling an 
upper servant, it simply doesn’t 
work.” Memtok sighed. “I’d recom- 
mend a change, if his assistant wasn’t 
even stupider.” 

“Memtok, I still never saw this.” 

“As may be. It was delivered, 
your deputy receipted for it. Look 
around your office. One bullock 
gets you three you’ll find it. Per- 
haps you’d like me to tingle your 
deputy? Glad to.” 

4tXTo, no.” Memtok was almost 

-L ^ certainly right, the order 
was probably on his own desk, un- 
read. Hugh’s department had grown 
to two or three dozen people, he 
did not .know how many; there 
seemed to be more every day. Most 
of them seemed to be button sorters 
or some such, all of them wanted to 
take up his time. Hugh had long 
since told the earnest, fairly literate 
clerk who was his deputy that he 
was not to be bothered with anything 
short of an emergency. Otherwise 



Hugh would have accomplished no 
translating after the first week; Park- 
inson’s Law had taken over. The 
clerk had obeyed, after some repri- 
mands, and routine matters stacked 
up. Every week or so Hugh would 
go through the stack rapidly, shove 
it all back at his deputy for file or 
burning or whatever it was they did 
with useless papers. 

Probably the order transferring 
Duke was in the current accumula- 
tion. If he had seen it in time — Too 
late, too late! He put his elbows on 
his knees and covered his face. Too 
late! Oh, my son! 

Memtok touched his shoulder al- 
most gently. “Cousin, take hold of 
yourself. Your prerogatives were not 
abridged. You see that, do you not?” 

“Yes. Yes, I see it,” Hugh mum- 
bled through his hands. 

“Then why are you so over- 
wrought?” 

“He was — He is — my son.” 

“He is? Then why are you behav- 
ing as if he were your nephew?” 
Memtok used the specific form, 
meaning “your eldest sister’s oldest 
son” and he was honestly puzzled 
by the savage’s odd reaction. He 
could understand a mother being in- 
terested in her son — or her oldest 
son, at least. But a father? Uncle! 
Memtok had sons, he was statistical- 
ly certain, throughout the house- 
hold — “One-Shot Memtok” the 
former slutmaster used to call him. 
But he didn’t know who they were 
and could not imagine wanting to 
know. Or caring. 

“Because — ” Hugh started. “Oh, 
forget it, forget it. You did your 
duty. Conceded.” 



78 



IF 




“Well — You still seem upset. I’ll 
send out for a bottle of Hapiness. 
ril join you, this once.” 

“No. No, thank you.” 

“Oh, come, come! You need it. 
A tonic is excellent, it is excess that 
one must avoid.” 

“Thanks, Memtok, but I really 
don’t want it. Right now I must be 
sharp, especially so. I want to see 
Their Charity. Right away if pos- 
sible. Will you arrange it for me?” 
“I can’t do that.” 

“Damn it, I know that you can. 
And I know he will see me if you 
ask him.” 

“Cousin, I didn’t say that I would 
not; I said T can*t.* Their Charity is 
not in residence.” 

“Oh.” Then he asked to have 
word sent to Joe — Joe would surely 
know what had happened, and why. 
But the Chief Domestic told him 
that the young Chosen had left with 
the Lord Protector. He promised to 
let Hugh know when either or both 
of them returned — yes, at once, 
cousin. 

H ugh skipped dinner, went to his 
rooms and brooded. He could 
not avoid tormenting himself with 
the thought that it was, in part at 
least, his own fault — no, no, not 
for failing to read every useless 
paper that came into his office the 
instant it arrived; no, that was sheer 
bad luck. Even if he checked his 
“junk mail” each morning, it prob- 
ably would have been too late. The 
two orders had probably gone out 
at the same time. 

What did anguish his soul was 



fear that he had pushed the first 
domino, in that quarrel with Duke 
the last time he had seen him. He 
could have lied to the boy, told him 
flatly that his mother was, to Hugh’s 
certain knowledge, a maid-in-waiting 
or some such, to the Lord Protec- 
tor’s sister, safe inside the royal 
harem and never seen by a man. 
Pampered, living the life of Riley, 
and happy in it — and that other tale 
was just the gossip servants talk to 
fill their idle minds. 

Duke would have believed it be- 
cause Duke would have wanted to 
believe it, and would have had no 
way to disprove it. 

As it was — 

Perhaps Duke had gone to see 
Their Charity. Perhaps Memtok had 
arranged it, or perhaps Duke had 
simply tried to hull his way in and 
the row had reached Ponse’s ears. 
In any case it was more than pos- 
sible, he saw now, that his advice 
to Duke to see the head man might 
well have resulted in a scene that 
would have caused Potise to order 
the tempering as casually as he 
would order his air coach. All too 
likely — 

He tried to tell himself that no 
one is ever responsible for another 
person’s actions. He believed it, he 
tried to live by it. But he found that 
cold intellectual wisdom no comfort. 

At last he quit brooding, got writ- 
ing materials, and got to work on 
a letter to Barbara. He had had not 
even a moment’s chance to tell her 
his plans for them to escape, no 
chance to work up a code. But from 
here on she must be ready at no 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 



79 




notice. He must tell her immedi- 
ately, somehow. 

Barbara knew German, he him- 
self had a smattering left over from 
one high school year of it. He could 
not speak, read, nor understand it — • 
but he recalled some words. He 
knew enough Russian to stumble 
through a simple conversation. Bar- 
bara had picked up a few words 
from him during their time in the 
wilderness — a game that they could 
share without giving Grace cause 
for jealousy — they often annoyed 
Grace unintentionally. 

H e wrote a draft of what he want- 
ed to say, then painfully trans- 
lated the letter into a mishmash of 
German, Russian, colloquial English, 
beatnik jive, literary allusions pig 
Latin, and special idioms. In the end 
he had a message that he was sure 
Barbara could puzzle out, but he was 
certain that no students of ancient 
languages could translate it into 
Language even in the unlikely event 
that the scholar knew English, Ger- 
man, and Russian. 

He was not afraid that it might 
be translated by anyone else. If 
Grace saw it, she pronounce it gib- 
berish; she knew no Russian, no 
German. Duke was off in a drug- 
ridden dreamworld. Joe might guess 
at the meaning — Joe was sharp — 
but he trusted Joe not to give him 
away. Nevertheless he tried to con- 
ceal the meaning even from Joe, 
intentionally hashing the syntax and 
using deliberate and obvious mis- 
spellings. 

The draft read: 



80 



My darling, 

I have been planning our escape for 
tome time. I do not know how I will 
manage it but I want you to be ready, 
day or night, to grab the twins and 
simply follow me. Steal food if you can, 
steal some stout shoes, steal a knife. 
We'll head for the mountains. I had 
intended to wait until next summer, let 
the boys grow some first. But something 
has happened to change my mind: 
Duke has been tempered. I don't know 
why and Tm too heartbroken to talk 
about it. But it could happen to me 
next. Worse than that. You remember 
Ponse's saying that he wanted to seo 
our twins as matched footmen? Darling, 
studs do not serve in the Banquet Hall. 
Nor is there any other fate in store for 
them; they are both going to be tall. 

It must not happen! 

And we can't wait. The caital city 
of the Protectorate is somewhere^ near 
where St. Louis used to be. We can't 
run all the way to the Rocky Mountains 
carrying our two boys — and we have 
no way of knowing (and no reason to 
expect) that all four of us will be sent 
here to the Summer Palace next year. 

Be brave. Don't touch any Happiness 
drug in any form from here on; our 
chance is likely to be a split-second one, 
with no warning. 

I love you,

Kitten was long asleep before 
Hugh finished composing this jar- 
gon. He then tore the draft into bits 
and dropped it down the whirlpool 
toilet, went to bed. After a long time 
haunted by Duke’s giggling, foolish, 
happy, drug-blurred face he got up 
and broke his own injunction to 
Barbara, dosed his sorrows and his 
fears with bottled “Happiness.”

day. It read:

Nothing else happened that day. 
Nor the next — or the next. Hugh 
doggedly dictated translations, his 
mind not on his work. He was very 
careful what he ate or drank, since 
he now knew the surgeon’s humane 
way of sneaking up on a victim; he 
ate only from dishes Memtok had 
eaten from, tried to be crafty by 
never accepting a fruit or a roll 
that was closest to him when a ser- 
vant offered him such, avoided 
drinking anything at the table — he 
drank only water which he himself 
had taken from the tap. He continu- 
ed to have breakfast in his room, 
but he started passing up many foods 
that he liked in favor of unpeeled 
fruits and boiled eggs in the shell. 

He knew these precautions were 
futile. No determined Borgia would 
have found them difficult to outwit, 
and in any case, if orders came to 
temper him, they need only grab him 
after subduing him with a whip if it 
proved difficult to drug him. But at 
least he might have time to protest, 
to demand that he be taken before 
the Lord Protector. 

As for whips — He resumed his 
karate practice, alone in his rooms. 
A karate blow delivered fast enough 
would cause even a whip wi elder to 
lose interest. There was no real hope 
behind any of it. He simply intended 
not to go peacefully. Duke had 
been right; it would have been better 
to have fought and died at once. 

He made no attempt to see Duke. 

He continued to hide food from 
his breakfast tray, sugar mostly, salt, 
and some hard bread. He assumed 
diat such food must be undrugged 



even though he ate none of it at the 
time, because it did not affect Kit- 
ten. 

He had been going barefoot most 
of the time but wearing felt slippers 
for his daily exercise walks in the 
servants’ garden. Now he complain- 
ed to Memtok that the gravel hurt 
his feet through these silly slippers 
— didn’t the household afford any- 
thing better? 

He was given heavy leather san- 
dals, wore them thereafter in the 
garden. 

He cultivated the household’s 
chief engineer, telling him that, in 
his youth, he had been in charge of 
construction for his former lord. 
The engineer was flattered, being not 
only one of the junior executive 
servants but also in the habit of 
hearing mostly complaints rather 
than friendly interest. Hugh sat with 
him after dinner and managed to 
appear knowledgeable largely by lis- 
tening. 

Hugh was invited to look around 
the plant, and spent a tiring morn- 
ing the next day crawling over pipes 
and looking at plans — the engineer 
could not write but could read a 
little and understood drawings. It 
would have been an interesting day 
in itself if Hugh had been free from 
worries; Hugh’s background made 
construction and engineering inter- 
esting to him. But he concentrated 
on trying to memorize every drawing 
he saw, match it in his mind with 
the passageways and rooms he was 
taken through. He had a deadly 
serious purpose; Despite having 
lived most of a summer in this big 



82 



IF 




building, he knew only small pieces 
of it inside and only a walled gar- 
den outside. He needed to know 
every possible exit from servants’ 
quarters, what lay behind the guard- 
ed door to sluts’ quarters, it layout, 
and most particularly, where in that 
area Barbara and the twins lived. 

H e got as far as the meander door 
that led into the distaff side. 
The engineer hesitated when the 
guard suddenly became alert. He 
said, “Cousin Hugh, I’m sure it’s all 
right for you to go in here, with 
me — but maybe we had better go 
up to the Chief Domestic’s office 
and have him write you out a pass.” 
“Whatever you say, cousin.” 
“Well, there really isn’t anything 
of interest in here. Just the usual 
appointments of a barracks — water, 
lights, air service, plumbing, baths, 
such things. All the interesting stuff, 
power plant, incinerator, air control, 
and so forth, is elsewhere. And you 
know how the boss is — likely to 
fret over any variation from routine. 
If it’s all the same to you. I’ll make 
my morning inspection in there this 
afternoon.” 

“However you want to arrange 
things,” Hugh answered with a sug- 
gestion of affronted dignity. 

“Well . everybody knows you’re 
not one of those disgusting young 
studs.” The engineer looked embar- 
rassed. “Tell you what. You just tell 
me flatly that you want to see every- 
tbing ... in my department that 
is . and I’ll trot up to Memtok and 
tell him you said so. He knows — 
Uncle! We all know — that you en- 



joy the favor of Their Charity. You 
understand me? I don’t mean to 
presume. Memtok will write out a 
pass right quick and I’ll be in the 
clear and so will the guard and the 
head guard. You wait here and be 
comfortable. I’ll hurry.” 

“Don’t bother. There’s nothing, in 
there I want to see,” Hugh lied. 
“You’ve seen one bath, you’ve seen 
’em all, I always say.” 

The engineer smiled in relief. 
“That’s a good one, I’ll remember 
that. ‘You’ve seen one bath, you’ve 
seen ’em all!’ Ha ha! Well, we’ve 
stiU got the carpentry shop and the 
metal shop.” 

Hugh went on with him, arm in 
arm and jovial, while fuming inside. 
So close! Yet letting Memtok sus- 
pect that he had any special interest 
in sluts’ quarters was the last thing 
he wanted. 

But the morning was well spent. 
Not only did Hugh acquire a bur- 
glar’s insight as to strong and weak 
points of the building (that delivery 
door to the unloading dock; if it 
was merely locked at night, it should 
be possible to break out. “G/ve me 
a lever long enough and a fulcrum 
to rest it on — ”) but also he picked 
up two prizes. 

The first was a broken piece of 
spring steel, about eight inches long. 
Hugh palmed it from some scrap in 
the metal shop; it wound up taped 
to his arm, after an unneeded 
plumbing call, for he had gone pre- 
pared to steal. 

The second was even more of a 
prize: a printed drawing of the 
lowest level, with engineering instal- 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOiD

latipns shown boldly — but with 
every door and passage marked — 
including sluts’ quarters. 

Hugh had admired it. “Uncle, but 
that’s a beautiful drawing! Your 
own work?” 

The engineer shyly admitted that 
it was. Based on architect’s plans, 
you understand — but changes keep 
having to be added. 

“Beautiful!” Hugh repeated. “It’s 
a shame there’s only one copy.” 

“Oh, plenty of copies, they wear 
out. Would you like one?” 

“I would treasure it. Especially if 
the artist would inscribe it to me.” 
When the man hesitated, Hugh mov- 
ed in fast and said, “May I suggest 
a wording? Here, I’ll write it out and 
you copy it.” 

Hugh walked away with the print, 
inscribed: “To my dear cousin 

Hugh, a fellow craftsman who ap- 
preciates beautiful work.” 

T hat night he showed it to Kitten. 

The child was awestruck. She 
had no concept of maps and was 
fascinated bv the idea that it was 
possible to put down, just on a piece 
of paper, the long passages and 
twisty turns of her world. Hugh 
showed her how one went from his 
quarters to the ramp leading up to 
the executive servants’ dining room, 
where the servants’ main dining hall 
was, how the passage outside led, by 
two turns, to the garden. She con- 
firmed the routes slowlv, frowning 
in unaccustomed mental effort. 

“You must live somewhere over 
here. Kitten. This area is sluts’ 
quarters.” 



“It is?” she asked, incredulous. 

“Yes. See if you can find where 
you live. I won’t show you, you 
know how now. I’ll just sit back.” 

“Oh. Uncle help me! Let me see. 
First, I have to come down this 
ramp — ” She paused to think while 
Hugh kept his face impassive. She 
had just confirmed what he had 
almost stopped suspecting; the child 
was a planted spy. “ — then . this 
is the door?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Then I walk straight ahead past 
the slutmaster’s office, clear to the 
end. and I turn, and ... I must live 
right therer She clapped her hands 
and giggled. 

“Your billet is across from your 
mess hall?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then you got it right, first time! 
That’s wonderful! Now let’s see what 
else you can figure out.” 

For the next quarter hour she 
took him on a tour of sluts’ quart- 
ers — junior and senior common 
rooms, messes, virgins’ dormitory, 
bed warmers’ sleep room, nursery, 
lying-in, children’s hall, service stalls, 
baths, playground door, garden 
door, offices, senior matron’s apart- 
ment, everything — and Hugh learn- 
ed that Barbara was no longer bil- 
leted in lying-in. He didn’t ask. Kit- 
ten volunteered it. 

“Barbara — you know, the savage 
slut you write to — she used to be 
there at first, and now she’s right 
there.^ 

“How can you tell? Those rooms 
all look alike.” 

“/ can tell. It’s the second one of 



84 



IF 




the four-molher rooms on this side, 
when you walk away from the 
baths.” 

Hugh noted with deep interest 
that a maintenance tunnel ran under 
the baths, with an access manhole in 
the very passage Barbara’s room was 
on — and with even deeper interest 
that this seemed to connect with 
another one that ran clear across the 
building. Could it be that here was 
a wide-open unguarded route be- 
tween all three main areas of ser- 
vants’ land? Surely not, as the lines 
seemed to show that any stud with 
initiative need only crawl a hundred 
yards in the dark to let himself into 
sluts’ quarters. 

Yet it might be true — for how 
would any stud know where those 
tunnels led? 

And why would a stud risk it if 
he guessed? With the ratio of intact 
males to breeding sluts about that 
of bulls to cows on a cattle ranch. 
And could thumbless hands handle 
the fastenings? 

For that matter, could those trap 
doors be opened from below? It 
might very well be impossible, prob- 
ably was. 

'‘You’re a fast learner. Kitten. 
Now try a p^rt you don’t know as 
well. Figure out, on the drawing, 
how to get from our rooms here to 
my offices. And if you solve that 
one, here’s a harder one. What turns 
you would take and what ramp you 
would use if I told you to take a 
message to the Chief Domestic?” 

She solved the first one after 
puzzling, the second she traced with- 
out hesitation. 



A t lunch next day, with Memtok 
at his elbow, Hugh called down 
the table to the engineer. “Pipes old 
cousin! That beautiful drawing you 
gave me yesterday — do you sup- 
pose one of your woodworkers could 
frame it for me? I’d like to hang it 
over my desk where people can. ad- 
mire it.” 

The engineer flushed and grinned 
widely. “Certainly, Cousin Hugh! 
How about a nice, clear-grained 
piece of mahogany?” 

“Perfect.” Hugh turned to his 
left. “Cousin Memtok, our cousin 
is wasted on pipes and plumbing. 
He’s an artist. As soon as I have 
it hung, you must stop by and see 
what I mean.” 

“Glad to. Cousin. When I find 
time. If I find time.” 

More than a week passed with 
no word about Their Charity, nor 
about Joe — a week of no bridge, 
and no Barbara. At last, one day at 
lunch, Memtok said, “By the way, 
I had been meaning to tell you, the 
young Chosen Joseph has returned. 
Do you still want to see him?” 
“Certainly. Is Their Charity also 
in residence?” 

“No. Their Gracious sister be- 
lieves that he may not return until 
after we go home. Ah, you must see 
that. Cousin! Not a cottage like this. 
Great doings night and day — and 
this humble servant will be lucky to 
get three meals in peace all winter. 
Run, run, run, worry, worry, worry, 
problems popping right and left,” 
he said with unctuous satisfaction. 
“Be glad you’re a scholar.” 

Word came a couple of hours 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD

later that Joe expected Hugh. Ho 
knew his way, having been to Joe’s 
guestrooms to help teach bridge to 
Chosen, so he went up alone, passed 
the check points and was escorted 
from the last one to Joe’s door. 

Joe greeted him enthusiastically. 
“Come in, Hugh! Find a seat. No 
protocol, nobody here but us chick- 
ens. Wait till you hear all I’ve ac- 
complished. Boy, have I been busy! 
One shop all ready to go as a pilot 
plant before Their Charity finished 
wangling the protection, all on the 
Q.T. But so organized that we were 
in production the same day protec- 
tion was granted. Not bad terms, 
either. Their Mercy takes half. Their 
Charity hangs onto half and floats 
the financing, and out of Their 
Charity’s half I’m cut in for ten per 
cent and manage the company. Of 
course as we branch out and into 
other lines — the whole thing is 
called ‘Inspired Games’ and the 
charter is written to cover almost 
any fun you can have outside of bed 
— as we branch out. I’ll need help 
in management. And that’s a sticky 
problem; I’m scared silly that old 
Ponse is going to want me to put 
some of his dull-witted relatives in. 
Hope not, there’s no place for nepot- 
ism when you’re trying to hold 
coats and turn an honest bullock. 
Probably best to train servants for 
it — cheaper in the long run, with 
the right sort. How about you, 
Hugh? Do you think you could 
swing the management of a factory? 
It’s a big job. I’ve got a hundred 
and seven people working there al- 
ready.” 



44j don’t see why not. I’ve bossed 
3- three times that many risking 
my own money, and never missed 
a payroll — and I once bossed over 
two thousand skilled trades of all 
sorts when I was in the Seabees. 
But, Joe, I came up here with some- 
thing on my mind.” 

“Uh, all right, all right, spill it. 
Then I want to show you the lay- 
out. And the plans.” 

“Joe, you know about Duke?” 
“What about Duke?” 

“Tempered. Didn’t you know?” 
“Oh. Yes, I knew. That happened 
just about as I left. He’s not hurt, 
is he? Complications?” 

“ ‘Hurt?’ Joe, he was tempered. 
You act as if he had merely had a 
tooth pulled. You knew? Didn’t you 
try to stop it?” 

“No.” 

“In the name of God, why not?'* 
“Let me finish, can’t you? I don’t 
recall that you tried to stop it, 
either.” 

“I never had the chance. I never 
knew.” 

“Neither did I. That’s what I’ve 
been trying to tell you, but you 
keep jumping down my throat. I 
learned about it the morning after 
it happened.” 

“Oh. Sorry. I thought you meant 
you just stood by and let it happen.” 
“Well, I didn’t. Don’t know what 
I could have done if I had known. 
Maybe asked Ponse to call you in 
and tell you, first, I suppose. 
Wouldn’t have done any good, so I 
guess we were both better off not 
having to fret about it. Maybe all 
for the best. Now about our plans. If

IF 




you*]\ have a look at this schematic 
layout, you’ll see — ” 

“Joe!” 

“Huh?” 

“Can’t you see I’m in no shape 
to talk about playing-card factories?” 
Joe folded up his plans. “I’m sor- 
ry, Hugh. Let’s sit down together 
and you talk, if it will make you 
feel better. I guess I’m pretty pre- 
occupied with this venture. It’s ex- 
citing. But get it off your chest. I 
suppose you do feel bad about it. 
Looking at it from one angle.” 

Joe listened, Hugh talked. Present- 
ly Joe shook his head. “Hugh, I can 
set your mind at rest on one point. 
Duke never did see the Lord Protec- 
tor. Never asked to, so far as 1 
know. So your advice to Duke — 
good enough advice, I think — could 
not have had anything to do with 
his being tempered.” 

“I hope you’re right. I’d feel like 
cutting my throat if I knew it was 
my fault.” 

“It’s not, so quit fretting about it.” 
“I’ll try. Joe, whatever possessed 
Ponse to do it. He knew how we 
felt about it, from that time it al- 
most happened through a misunder- 
standing. So why would he? I 
thought he was my friend.” 

Joe looked embarrassed. “You 
really want to know?” 

“I’ve got to know.” 

“Well . you’re bound to find 
out. Grace did it.” 

That? Joe. you must be mis- 
^ ^ taken. Sure, sure, Grace 
has her faults. But she wouldn’t have 
that done to her own son.” 



“Well, no, not exactly. I doubt if 
she knew what it was until after it 
was done. But, just the same, she' 
set it off. She’s been wheedling 
Ponse and whining at him almost 
from the day we got here that she 
wanted her Dukie with her. She was 
lonesome. Tonsie, I’m lonesome. 
Ponsie, you’re being mean to Gracie. 
Ponsie, I’m going to tickle you until 
you say Yes. Ponsie, why won’t 
you?’ — all in that baby whine she 
uses sometimes. Always uses now, 
I should say. Hugh, I guess you 
didn’t see much of it.” 

“None of it.” 

“I would have wrung her neck. 
But Ponse just ignored her, except 
when she tickled him. Then he would 
laugh and they would roll on the 
floor and he would tell her to shut 
up, and make her sit quiet for a 
while. Treated her just like one of 
the cats. Honest, I don’t think he 
ever — I mean, it doesn’t seem like- 
ly, from what I saw that he was 
interested in her as a — ” 

“And I’m not interested. Didn’t 
anybody tell Grace what it would 
entail, for her to have her son with 
her?” 

“Hugh. I don’t think so. It would 
never occur to Ponse that any ex- 
planation was required . and cer- 
tainly I never discussed it with her. 
Not that she ever talked to me much. 
She doesn’t like me any more, I 
take up too much of her Ponsie’s 
time.” Joe wrinkled his nose. “I 
doubt if she knew. Of course she 
should have figured it out on her 
own. Anybody else would have. But, 
excuse me, since she’s your wife. 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



87 




but I’m not sure she’s bright 
enough.” 

“And hopped up on Happiness, 
too- — every time I caught sight of 
her. No, she’s not bright. But she’s 
not my wife, either. Barbara is my 
wife.” 

“Well . legally speaking, a ser- 
vant can’t have a wife.” 

“I wasn’t speaking legally, I was 
speaking the truth. But even though 
Grace is no longer my wife, I’m 
somewhat comforted to know that 
she probably didn’t push it knowing 
what it would cost Duke.” 

Joe looked thoughful. “Hugh, I 
don’t think she did . but I don’t 
think she really cares, either . 
and I’m not sure that you can pro- 
perly say that it cost Duke any- 
thing.” 

“You might explain those state- 
ments. Perhaps I’m dense.” 

“Well, if Grace minds that Duke 
has been tempered, she certainly 
doesn’t show it. She’s pleased as 
punch. And he doesn’t seem to 
mind.” 

“You’ve seen them? Since?” 

“Oh, yes. I had breakfast with 
Their Charity yesterday morning. 
They were both there.” 

“I thought Ponse was still away?” 

iCT Te was back and now he’s 
A 1 gone out to the west coast. 
Business. We’re really tearing into 
it. He was only here a couple of 
days. But he had this birthday pre- 
sent for Grace. Duke, I mean. Yes, 
I know it wasn’t her birthday, hers 
k in December, as I recall, and any- 
how birthdays aren’t anything nowa- 



days; it’s namedays that counts. But 
she told Ponse she was about to 
have a birthday and kept wheedling 
him — and you know Ponse, indul- 
gent with animals and kids. And 
with Grace. So he set it up as a 
surprise for her. The minute he was 
back, he made a present of Duke to 
her. Shucks, they’ve even got a 
room somewhere off Ponse’s private 
quarters. Neither one of them has 
to sleep below stairs any longer, they 
live up here. In the private-private 
quarters I mean. Where you’ve been, 
where we play bridge.” 

“Okay, I don’t care where they 
sleep. You were telling me how 
Grace felt about it. And Duke.” 

“Oh, yes. Can’t say just when she 
found out what had been done to 
Duke to make it possible for him to 
be with her, all I can say is that she 
is so happy about it that she was 
even cordial with me — telling me 
what a dear Ponsie was to arrange 
it and doesn’t Dukie look just grand? 
In his new clothes? Stuff like that. 
She’s got him dressed in the fancy 
livery the servants wear up here, 
not a robe like that you’re wearing. 
She’s even put jewelry on him. Ponse 
doesn’t mind. He’s an outright gift, 
a servant’s servant, Grace’s. Actually 
I don’t think he does a lick of work, 
he’s just her pet. And she loves it 
that way.” 

“But how about Duke?” Hugh 
persisted. 

“That’s what I’ve been telling 
you, Hugh. Duke hasn’t lost by it. 
He’s snug as a bug in a rug and he 
knows it. He was almost patronizing 
to me. You might have thought I 



88 



IF 




was the one wearing livery instead 
of the other way around. With 
Grace in solid with the big boss and 
with her wound around his little 
finger, Duke thinks he’s got it made. 
Well, he has, Hugh. And I didn’t 
mind his manner; I could see he 
was hopped on this tranquilizer you 
servants use.” 

‘'You call it ‘got it made’ when 
a man is grabbed and drugged and 
tempered and then kept drugged so 
that he doesn’t care what happens 
to him? Joe, I’m surprised. I’m 
shocked.” 

“Certainly I call it that. Hugh, 
put your prejudices aside and look 
at it rationally. Duke is happy. If 
you don’t believe it, let me take you 
in there and you talk to him. Talk 
to both of them. I’m free to go in 
there even when Their Charity is 
not in residence and I’ll take the 
liberty of taking you with me, though 
I shouldn’t. See for yourself.” 

“No, I’ll take your word for it, 
I don’t think I could stomach it. I’ll 
concede that Duke is happy. I’m 
well aware that, if you feed a man 
enough of that ‘Happiness’ drug, 
he’ll be happy as a lark even if you 
cut off his arms and legs and then 
start on his head. But you can be 
that sort of ‘happy’ on morphine. 
Or heroin. Or opium. That doesn’t 
make it a good thing. It’s a tragedy.” 

“Oh, don’t be melodramatic, 
Hugh. These things are all relative. 
Consider it in its frame. Duke was 
certain to be tempered eventually. 
It’s not lawful for a servant as big 
as he is to be kept for stud. I’m sure 
you know that. So what difference 



does it make whether it’s done last 
week, or next year, or when Ponse 
dies. The only difference is that he 
is happy in a life of luxury, instead 
of hard manual labor in a mine, or 
a rice swamp, or such. He doesn’t 
know anything useful, he could never 
hope to rise very high. High for a 
servant, I mean.” 

“Joe, do you know .what you 
sound like? Like some white-supre- 
macy apologist telling how well off 
the darkies used to be, a-sittin’ out- 
side their cabins, a-strummin’ their 
banjoes, and singin’ spirituals.” 

Joe blinked. “I could resent that.” 

H ugh Farnham was angry and 
feeling reckless. “Go ahead 
and resent it! I can’t stop you. 
You’re a Chosen, I’m a servant. Can 
I fetch your white sheet for you, 
Massah? What time does the Klan 
meet?” 

“Shut up!” 

Hugh Farnham shut up. Joe went 
on quietly, “I won’t bandy words 
with you. I suppose it does look 
that way, to you. If so, do you 
expect me to weep? The shoe is on 
the other foot, that’s all — and high 
time. I used to be a servant. Now 
I’m a respected businessman — with 
a good chance of becoming a nephew 
by marriage of some noble family. 
Do you think I would swap back, 
even if I could? For Duke? Not for 
anybody, I’m no hypocrite. I was a 
servant, now you are one. What 
are you beefing about?” 

“Joe, you were a decently treated 
employee. You were not a slave.” 
The younger man’s eyes suddenly 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 



89 




became opaque and his features took 
on an ebony hardness Hugh had 
never seen in him before. “Hugh,” 
he said softly, “have you ever made 
a bus trip through Alabama? As a 
‘nigger’?” 

“No.” 

“Then shut up. You don’t know 
what you are talking about.” He 
went on, “The subject is closed and 
now we’ll talk business. I do want 
you to see what I’ve done and am 
planning to do. This games notion 
is the best idea I ever had.” 

Hugh did not argue whose idea 
it had been; he listened while the 
young man went on with eager en- 
thusiasm. At last Joe put down his 
pen and sat back. “What do you 
think of it? Any suggestions? You 
made some useful suggestions when 
I proposed it to Ponse — keep on 
being useful and there will be a 
good place in it for you.” 

H ugh hesitated. It seemed to him 
that Joe’s plans were too am- 
bitious in the early stages in view 
of the fact that the market was only 
a potential and a demand had yet 
to be created. He did not say so. 
All he said was, “It might be worth 
while to package with each deck, 
no extra charge, a rule book.” 
“Oh, no, we’ll sell those separate- 
ly. Make money on them. ” 

“I didn’t mean a complete Hoyle. 
Just a pamphlet with some of the 
simpler games. Cribbage. A couple 
of solitaire games. One or two 
others. Do that and the customers 
start enjoying them at once. It 
should lead to more sales.” 



“Hmm. Pll think about it.” Joe 
folded up his papers, set them aside. 
“Hugh, you got so shirty a while 
ago that I didn’t tell you one thing 
I have in mind.” 

“Yes?” 

“Ponse is a grand old man, but 
he isn’t going to live forever. I plan 
to have my own affairs separate 
from his by then so that I’ll be fin- 
ancially independent. Trade around 
interests somehow, untangle it. I 
guess I don’t need to tell you that 
I’m not anxious to have Mrika as 
my boss — and I didn’t tell you, so 
don’t repeat it. But I’ll manage it. 
I’m looking out for number one.” 
He grinned. “And when Mrika is 
Lord Protector I won’t be living 
here. I’ll have a household of my 
own, a modest one — and I’ll need 
servants. Guess whom I plan to 
adopt when I staff it.” 

“I couldn’t.” 

“Not you — although you may 
very well be a business servant to 
me, if it turns out you really can 
manage a job. No, I had in mind 
adopting Grace and Duke.” 
“Huh?” 

“Surprised? Mrika won’t want 
them, that’s certain. He despises 
Grace because of her influence over 
his uncle, and it’s a sure thing he’s 
not going to like Duke any better. 
Neither of them is trained and it 
shouldn’t be expensive to adopt them 
from him if I don’t appear to eager. 
But they would be useful to me. For 
one thing, since they speak English, 
I’d be able to talk to them in a 
language nobody else knows. And 
that could be an advantage, especi-

IF 




ally when other servants are around. 
But best of all — well, the food here 
is good but sometimes I get a long- 
ing for some plain old American 
cooking. And Grace is a very good 
cook, when she wants to be. So 1*11 
make her a cook. Duke can’t cook 
but he can learn to wait on table 
and answer the door and such. 
Houseboy, in other words.” 

Hugh said slowly, “Joe, you don’t 
want them because Grace can cook.” 
Joe grinned unashamedly. “No, 
not entirely. I think Duke would 
look real good as my houseboy. And 
Grace as my cook. Tit for tat. Oh, 
ril treat them decently, Hugh, don’t 
you worry. They work hard and be- 
have themselves and they won’t get 
tingled. However, I don’t doubt but 
what it will take a few tingles before 
they get the idea.” He twitched his 
quirt. “And I won’t say I won’t 
enjoy teaching them. I owe them 
both a little. Three years, Hugh. 
Three years of Grace’s endless de- 
mands, never satisfied with anything 
— and three years of being treated 
with patronizing contempt by Duke 
whenever he was around.” 

Hugh said nothing. Joe said, 
“Well? What do you think of my 
plan?” 

“I thought you were a gentleman, 
Joe. It seems I was wrong.” 

“So?” Joe barely twitched his 
quirt. “Boy, we excuse you. All.” 

XVIII 

H ugh came away from Joe’s 
rooms feeling uttedy discoiw- 

aged. 

FARNHAM^S FREeHOLD 



He knew that he had been foolish 
— no, criminally careless! — in lot- 
ting Joe get his goat. He needed Joe. 
Until he had Barbara and the twins 
safely hidden in the high moun- 
tains, he needed every possible source 
of favor and privilege. Joe, Mem- 
tok, Ponse, anyone he could find — 
and probably Joe most of all. Joe 
was a Chosen. Joe could go any- 
where, tell him things he didn’t 
know, give him things he could not 
possibly steal. He had even consid- 
ered, as a last resort, asking Joe 
to plot with him, help them to es- 
cape. 

Not now! It would take long and 
careful buttering before he could 
risk that. Idiot! Utter fool! To risk 
Barbara and the boys just because 
you can’t hold your bloody temper! 

It seemed to him that things were 
as bad as they could get — and part 
of it his own folly. 

But he soon learned that things 
could be much worse. 

He did not stand around moping; 
he looked up Memtok. It had be- 
come more urgent than ever to set 
up some way to communicate with 
Barbara. Secretly. And that meant 
that he had to talk to her — and 
that mean at least one bridge game 
in the Lord Protector’s lounge and 
a snatch of talk even if he had to 
talk English in front of Ponse. He 
had to force matters. 

Hugh found the Chief Domestic 
leaving his office. “Cousin Memtok, 
could you spare me a word?” 

Memtok’s habitual frown barely 
relaxed. “Certainly, cousin. But walk 
along with me, will you? Trouble, 

f1 




trouble, trouble. You would think 
that a department head could run 
his department without someone to 
wipe his nose, wouldn’t you? You’d 
be wrong. The freezer flunky com- 
plains to the leading butcher and he 
complains to the chef, and it’s a 
maintenance matter, and you would 
think that Gnou would take it up 
directly with engineering and be- 
tween them they would settle it. Oh, 
no! They both come to me with 
their troubles. You know some- 
thing about construction, don’t you?’* 
“Yes,” Hugh admitted, “but I’m 
not up to date in the subject. It has 
been some years.” (About two thou- 
sand, my friend! But we won’t 
speak of that.) 

“Construction is construction. 
Come along, give me the benefit of 
your advice.” 

(And find out that I’m faking. 
Chum, ril double-talk you to death.) 
“Certainly. If this humble one’s 
opinion is worth anything.” 

“Damned chill room. It’s been 
a headache every summer. I’m glad 
we’ll be back in the Palace soon,” 
“Has the date been set? May one 
ask?” 

“One may. A week from tomor- 
row. So it’s time to think about 
packing up your department and 
being ready to move.” 

I t was a body blow. Hugh almost 
stumbled but he tried to keep 
his face calm and his voice steady. 
“So soon?” 

“Why are you looking worried? 
A few files, some office equipment. 
Have you any idea how many thou- 



sands of items I have on inventory? 
And how much gets stolen, or lost, 
or damaged simply because you 
can’t trust any of these fools? 
Uncle!” 

“It must be terribly wearing,” 
agreed Hugh. “But that brings to 
mind something. I petitioned you 
to let me know when Their Charity 
was next in residence. I learned from 
the young Chosen, Joseph, that 
Their Charity returned a day or two 
ago and is now gone again.” 

“Are you criticizing?” 

“Uncle forbid! I was just asking.” 
“It is true that Their Charity was 
physically present for a short time. 
But he was not officially in resi- 
dence. Not in the best of health, it 
seemed to be — Uncle protect him.” 
“Uncle protect him well!” Hugh 
answered sincerely. “Under the cir- 
cumstances naturally you did not 
ask him to grant me an audience. 
But could I ask of you the small 
favor, next time — ” 

“We’ll talk later. Let’s see what 
these two helpless ones have to of- 
fer.” Head Chef Gnou and the Chief 
Engineer met them at the entrance 
to Gnou’s domain, they went on 
through the kichen, through the 
butcher shop, and into the cold 
room. But they lingered in the butch- 
er shop, Memtok impatient, while 
parka-like garments were fetched, 
the Chief Domestic having refused 
the ones offered on the legitimate 
grounds that they were soiled. 

The butcher shop was very crowd- 
ed with live helpers and dead car- 
casses — birds, beeves, fish, any- 
thing. Hugh reflected that thirty- 



92 



IF 




eight Chosen and four hundred and 
fifty servants ate a lot of meat. He 
found the place mildly depressing 
even though he himself had clean- 
ed and cut and trimmed many an 
animal. 

But only his habitual tight control 
in the presence of Memtok and his 
“cousins” in service kept him from 
showing shock at something he saw 
on the floor, trimmed from a car- 
cass almost cut up on one block. 

It was a dainty, plump, very fe- 
minine hand. 

Hugh felt dizzy, there was a 
roaring in his ears. He blinked. It 
was still there. A hand much like 
Kitten’s — 

He breathed carefully, controlled 
the retching within him, kept his 
back turned until he had command 
over himself. There had suddenly 
flooded over him the truth behind 
certain incongruities, certain idioms, 
some pointless jokes. 

He now understood what they 
had meant. 

G nou was making nervous con- 
versation while his boss wait- 
ed. He moved to the chopping block, 
unintentionally kicking the dainty 



little hand underneath into a pile 
of scraps and said, “Here’s one you 
won’t have to bother to taste. Chief 
Domestic. Unless the old one re- 
turns unexpectedly.” 

“I always bother to taste,” Mem- 
tok said coldly. “Their Charity ex- 
pects his table to be perfect whether 
he is in residence or not.” 

“Oh, yes, surely,” Gnou agreed. 
“That’s what I always tell my cooks. 
But — Well, this very roast illus- 
trates one of my problems. Too fat. 
You’ll feel that it’s greasy — and so 
it will be. But that’s what comes of 
using sluts. Now, in my opinion, you 
can’t find a nicer piece of meat, 
marbled but firm, than a buck tem- 
pered not older than six, then hung 
at twice that age.” 

“No one asked your opinion,” 
Memtok answered. “Their Charity’s 
opinion is the only one that counts. 
They thinks that sluts are more ten- 
der.” 

“Oh, I agree, I agree! No offense 
intended.” 

“And none taken. In fact I agree 
with your opinion. I was simply 
making clear that your opinion — 
and mine in this matter — is irrele- 
vant. I see they’ve fetched them. 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD

Did they stop to make them?” 

The party put on heavy garments, 
went on inside. The engineer had 
said nothing up to then, effacing 
himself other than a nod and a 
friendly grin to Hugh. Now he ex- 
plained the problem, a cranky one 
of refrigeration. Hugh tried to keep 
his eyes on it, rather than on the 
contents of the meat storage room. 

Most of the meat was beef and 
fowl. But one long row of hooks 
down the center held what he knew 
he would find — human carcasses, 
gutted and cleaned and frozen, hang- 
ing head down, save that the heads 
were missing. Young sluts and 
bucks, he could see, but whether the 
bucks were tempered or not was 
no longer evident. He gulped and 
thanked his unlucky stars that that 
pathetic little hand had given him 
some warning, at least saved him 
from fainting. 

“Well, Cousin Hugh, what do you 
think?” 

“Why, I agree with Pipes.” 

“That the problem can’t be solv- 
ed?” 

“No, no.” Hugh had not really 
listened. “His reasoning is correct 
and he implied the answer. As he 
says, the problem can’t be solved 
— now. The thing to do is not to 
try to patch it up. now. Wait a week. 
Tear it out. Put in new equipment.” 

Memtok looked sour. “Expen- 
sive.” 

“But cheaper in the long run. 
Good engineering isn’t accomplished 
by grudging a few bullocks. Isn’t 
that right. Pipes?” 

The engineer nodded vigorously. 



“Just what I always say, Cousin 
Hugh! You’re absolutely right.” 
Memtok still frowned. “Well — • 
prepare an estimate. Show it to 
Cousin Hugh before you bring it to 
me. 

Memtok paused on the way out 
and patted the loin of a stripling 
buck carcass. “That’s what I would 
call a nice piece of meat. Eh, Hugh?” 
“Beautiful,” Hugh agreed with a 
straight face. “Your nephew, per- 
haps? Or just a son?” 

T here was a frozen silence. No- 
body moved except that Mem- 
tok seemed to grow taller. He raised 
his whip of authority most slightly, 
no more than tightening his thumb- 
less grip. 

Then suddenly he grimaced and 
gave a dry chuckle. “Cousin Hugh, 
your well-known wit will be the 
death of me yet. That’s a good one. 
Gnou, remind me to tell that this 
evening.” 

The chef agreed and chuckled, 
the engineer roared. Memtok gave 
his cold little laugh again. “I’m afraid 
I can’t claim the honor, Hugh. All 
these critters are ranch bred, not 
one of them is a cousin of ours. 
Yes, I know how it is in some house- 
holds, but Their Charity considers 
it unspeakably vulgar to serve a 
house servant, even in cases of ac- 
cidental death. And besides, it makes 
the servants restless.” 
“Commendable.” 

“Yes. It is gratifying to serve one 
who is a stickler for propriety. 
Enough, enough, lime is wasting. 
Walk back with me, Hugh.” 



94 



IF 




Once they were clear of the rest 
Memtok said, “You were saying?” 

“Excuse me?” 

“Come, come, you’re being ab- 
sent-minded today. Something about 
Their Charity not being in resi- 
dence.” 

“Oh, yes. Memtok, could you 
possibly, as a special favor to me, 
let me know the minute Their Chari- 
ty returns? Whether officially in 
residence or not? Not petition any- 
thing for me. Just let me know.” 
Damn it, with time pouring away 
like life through a severed artery his 
only course might be a belly-scrap- 
ing apology to Joe. then get Joe to 
intercede. 

“No.” said Memtok. “No. I don’t 
think I can.” 

“T beg your pardon? Has this one 
offended you?” 

“You mean that witticism? Heav- 
en, no! Some might find it vulgar 
and one bullock gets you three that 
if you had told it in sluts’ quarters 
some of them would have fainted. 
But if there is one thing I pride 
myself on, Hugh, it’s my sense of 
humor — and any day I can’t see a 
joke simply because I am the butt 
of it, T’ll petition to turn in my 
whip. No, it was simply my turn to 
have a little joke at your expense. 
I said, T don’t think I can.’ That is 
a statement of two meanings — a 
double-meaning joke, follow me? I 
don’t think I can tell you when 
Their Charity returns because he has 
sent word to me that he is not re- 
turning. So you’ll see him next at 
the Palace . and I promise I’ll 
let you know when he’s in resi- 



dence.” The Chief Domestic dug 
him in the ribs. “I wish you had 
seen your own face. My little joke 
wasn’t nearly as sharp as yours. But 
your jaw dropped. Very comical.” 

H ugh excused hmself, went to 
his rooms, took an extra bath, 
a most thorough one, then simply 
thought until dinner time. 

He braced himself for the ordeal 
of dinner with a carefully measured 
dose of Happiness — not enough to 
affect him later, strong enough to 
carry him through dinner, now that 
he knew why “pork” appeared so 
often on the menu of the Chosen. 
He suspected that the pork served 
to the servants was really pork. But 
he intended to eat no more bacon 
nevertheless. Nor ham, nor ponk 
chops, nor sausage. In fact he might 
turn vegetarian. 

He was very busy that evening, 
writing long after Kitten was asleep. 
It had become utterly necessary to 
reach Barbara secretly, yet his only 
means was the insecure route 
through Kitten. The problem was to 
write to Barbara in a code that only 
she could read, and which she would 
see as a code without having been 
warned and without the code being 
explained to her — and yet one 
which was safe from others. But the 
double-talk mixture he had last sent 
her would not do; he was now going 
to have to give her detailed instruc- 
tions, ones where it really mattered 
if she missed a word or failed to 
guess a concealed meaning. 

His last draft was a miracle of 
double-talk.

Since Hugh had never discussed 
Edgar Allan Poe with Barbara at 
any time, he was certain that she 
would study the note for a hidden 
message. The only question was 
whether or not she would find it. 
He wanted her to read it as: 

If 

you 

can 

read 

this 

answer 

the 

same 

way 

period 

Having done his best he put it 
aside, first disposing of all trial work, 
then prepared to do something else 
much more risky. At that point he 



would have given his chances of 
immortal bliss, plus 10% for a cheap 
flashlight — and then have settled 
for a candle. 

His rooms were lighted, brilliantly 
or softly as he wished, by glowing, 
translucent spheres set in the upper 
corners. Hugh did not know what 
they were save that they were not 
any sort of electric light he had 
ever known. They gave off no heat, 
seemed not to require wiring, and 
were controlled by little cranks. 

A similar light, the size of a golf 
ball, was mounted on his scroll 
reader. It was controlled by twist- 
ing it; he had decided tentatively 
that twisting these spheres polarized 
them in some way. 

He tried to dismount the scroll 
reader light. 

He finally got it loose by breaking 



96 



IF 




the upper frame. It was now a fea- 
tureless, brilliantly shining ball and 
nothing he could do would dim it 
— which was almost as embarrass- 
ing as no light at all. 

He found that he could conceal 
it in an armpit under his robe. There 
was still a glow but not much. 

H e made sure that Kitten was 
asleep, turned out all lights, 
raised his corridor door, looked out. 
The passageway was dim, lighted 
only by a standing light at an inter- 
section fifty yards away. Regrettably 
he had to go that way. He had ex- 
pected no light at this hour. 

He felt his “knife” taped to his 
left arm — not much of a knife, 
but patient whetting with a rock 
picked up from a garden path had 
put and edge on it, and tape had 
made a firm grip. It still needed 
hours more work and he could work 
on it only after Kitten was asleep 
or in time stolen from working 
hours. But it felt good to have it 
there and it was the only knife, 
chisel, screwdriver, or burglar’s jim- 
my that he had. 

The manhole to the engineering 
service tunnels which he wanted lay 
in the passage to the right after he 
had to pass' the lighted intersection. 
Any manhole would do, hut that one 
was on the logical route to the vet- 
erinary’s quarters. If caught outside 
his rooms but otherwise without 
cream on his lip. he planned to 
plead a sudden stomach ache. 

The manhole cover swung back 
easily on a hinge, it was fastened by 
a clasp that needed only turning to 



free it. The floor of the tunnel, 
glimpsed with his tiny sphere, lay 
four feet below the corridor floor. 
He started to let himself down and 
ran into his first trouble. 

These manholes, and the tunnels 
they led to, had been intended for 
men a foot shorter and fifty pounds 
lighter than Hugh Farnham, and 
proportionately smaller in shoulders, 
hips, hand-and-knees, height, and 
so forth. 

But he could make it. He had to. 

He wondered how he would make 
it when it counted, crawling and 
carrying at least one baby. But that 
he had to do, too. So he would. 

He almost trapped himself. Barely 
in time he found that the under side 
of the steel door was smooth, no 
handle and that it latched automati- 
cally by a spring catch. 

That settled why no one worried 
that the studs might gain unplanned 
access to sluts. But it also settled 
something else. Hugh had seriously 
considered snatching this very 
chance, if he found things quiet at 
the other end: Wake Barbara, bring 
all four of them back via the tunnel 
— then outside and away, by any 
of half a dozen weak points, away 
and off to the mountains on foot, 
reach them before light, find some 
stream and ford it endwise long 
enough to throw off hounds. Go, 
go, go.' With almost no food, with 
nothing but a makeshift knife, with 
no equipment, a “night shirt” for 
clothing, and no hope of anvthing 
better. Go? And save his family, of 
die with them. But die free! 

Perhaps, perhaps some day his 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



ff 




twin sons, wiser in the new ways 
than himself and toughened by a 
life fighting nature, could lead an 
uprising against this foul thing. But 
all he planned to do, all he could 
hope for, was get them free, keep 
them free, alive and free and un- 
gelded until they were grown and 
strong. 



Or die. 

Such was still his plan. He wast- 




ed not a moment sorrowing over 
that spring catch. It merely meant 
that he must communicate with Bar- 
bara, and set a time with her, be- 
cause she would have to open the 
hatch at the far end. Tonight he 
could only reconnoiter. 

He found that tape from his 
knife handle would hold the spring 
catch back. He tested it from above, 
and found that the lid could now 
be swung back without turning the 
clasp. 

But his wild instincts warned him 
that this would not do. The tape 
might not Hold until he was back. 
He might be trapped inside. 

H e spent a sweating half hour 
working on that spring catch, 
using knife and fingers and holding 
the light ball in his teeth. 



At last he managed to get at and 
break the spring. He removed the 
catch entirely. The manhole, closed, 
now looked normal, but it could be 
opened from underneath with just 
a push. 

Only then did he let himself down 
inside and close it over him. 

He started oiit on knees and el- 
bows with the light in his mouth, 
and stopped almost at once. The 




damned skirt of his robe kept him 
from crawling! He tried bunching it 
around his waist. It slid down. 



At last he inched back to the 
manhole shaft, took the pesky gar- 
ment off entirely, left it under the 
manhole and crawled away without 
it, naked save for knife strapped to 
his arm and the light in his teeth. 
He found that he could then make 
fair progress, although never able 
to get fully on hands and knees. His 
elbows had to be bent, his thighs he 
could not bring erect, and there were 
places where valves and fittings of 
the pipes he crawled past forced 
him almost to his belly. 

Nor could he tell how far he was 
going. However, there were joints 
in the tunnel about (it seemed to 
him) every thirty feet; he counted 
them and tried to match them in his 



98 



IF 



mind with the engineering drawing. 

Pass under two manholes . 
•harp left turn into another tunnel 
at next manhole . crawl about 
a hundred and fifty feet and under 
one manhole — 

Something more than an hour 
later he was under a manhole which 
had to be the one closest to Barbara. 

If he had not lost himself in the 
bowels of the palace — If he had 
correctly remembered that complex 
drawing — If the drawing was up to 
date — (Had two thousand years 
made any difference in the well- 
known lag between engineering 
changes and revisions of the prints 
to match?) If Kitten knew what she 
was talking about in locating Bar- 
bara’s billet by a method so novel 
to her — If it was still Barbara’s 
billet — 

He crouched in the awkward space 
and tried to press his ear against 
the shaft’s cover. 

He heard a baby cry. 

About ten minutes later he heard 
hushed female voices. They ap- 
proached, passed over him, and 
someone stepped on the lid. 

Hugh unkinked himself, prepared 
to return. The space was so tight 
that the ob'Wous way was to back 
up the way» he had come, so he 
found himself trying to crawl back- 
ward through the tunnel. 

That worked so poorly that he 
came back to the shaft and, with 
some contortions and loss of skin, 
he sot turned around. 

What seemed hours later he was 
convinced that he was lost. He began 
to wonder which was the more like- 



ly: Would he starve or die of thirst 
down here? Or would some repair- 
man get the shock of his simple life 
by finding him first? 

But he kept on crawling. 

His hands found his robe before 
his eyes saw it. Five minutes later 
he was in it; seven minutes later 
(he stopped to listen) he was up and 
out and had the lid closed. He forc- 
ed himself not to run back to his 
rooms. 

Kitten was awake. 

He wasn’t aware of it until she 
followed him into the bath. Then 
she was saying with wide-eyed hor- 
ror, “Oh, dear! Your poor knees! 
And your elbows, too.” 

“I stumbled and fell down.” 

She didn’t argue it, she simply 
insisted on bathing him and salving 
and taping the raw places. But when 
she started to pick up his dirty robe, 
he told her sharply to go to bed. 
He did not mind her touching his 
robe. But his knife had been on top 
of it and only by clumsy maneuver- 
ing had he managed to keep himself 
between her and it long enough for 
him to flip a fold of cloth over the 
weapon. 

Kitten went silently to bed. Hugh 
hid the knife in its usual place 
(much too high for Kitten), then 
went into his living room and found 
the child crying in her pillow. He 
petted her, soothed her, said he had 
not meant to sound harsh, and fed 
with her while she drank it, watched 
her go happily to sleep. 

Then he did not even try to get 
along without it himself. Kitten had 
her a bonus dose of Happiness — sat 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD

gone to sleep with one hand outside 
her cover. It looked to Hugh exactly 
like a forlorn little hand he had seen 
twelve hours earlier on the floor of 
a butcher shop. 

He was exhausted and the drink 
let him go to sleep. But not to rest. 
He found himself at a dinner party, 
black tie and dressy. But he did not 
like the menu. Hungarians goulash 
. French fries . Chinese 
noodles . po’ boy sandwich . 
breast of peasant . baked Alask- 
ans — but it was all pork. His host 
insisted that he taste every dish. 
“Come, come!” he chided with a 
witnry smile. “How do you know 
you don’t like it if you don’t taste it? 
One bullock gets you three you’ll 
learn to love it.” 

Hugh moaned and could not wake 
up. 

itten did not chatter at break- 
fast, which suited him. Two 
hours of nightmare-ridden sleep was 
not enough, yet it was necessary to 
go to his office and pretend to work. 
Mostly he stared at the print framed 
over his desk while his scroll reader 
clicked unnoticed. After lunch he 
sneaked away and tried to catch a 
nap. But the engineer scratched at 
his door and apologetically asked 
him to look over his estimates on 
refitting the meat cooler. Hugh pour- 
ed his guest a dollop of Happiness, 
then pretended to study figures that 
meant nothing to him. After a de- 
cent time he complimented the man, 
then scrawled a note to Memtok, 
recommending the idea that the con- 
tract be let. 



Barbara’s note that night applaud- 
ed the idea of a literary discussion 
club by mail and discussed Mark 
Twain. Hugh was interested only in 
how it read diagonally:

F or the next three days Hugh’s 
letters to Barbara were very 
long and chatty and discussed every- 
thing from Mark Twain’s use of col- 
loquial idiom to the influence of pro- 
gressive education on the relaxation 
of grammar. Her answers were 
lengthy, equally “literary,” and re- 
ported that she would be ready to

the hatch, confirmed that she 
understood, that sihe had a little 
stock of food, had no knife, no 
shoes — but that her feet were very 
calloused — and that her only wor- 
ry was that the twins might cry or 
that her roommates might wake up, 
especially as two of them were still 
giving night feedings to their babies. 
But for Hugh not to worry, she 
would manage. 

Hugh drew a fresh bottle of Hap- 
piness, taped it near the top of the 
shaft, instructed her to tell her room- 
mates that she had stolen it, then 
use it to get them so hopped on the 
drug that they would either sleep or 
be so slaphappy that if they did 
wake, they would do nothing but 
giggle — and, if possible, get enough 
of the drug into the twins that the 
Infants would pass out and not cry 
no matter how they were handled. 

Making an extra trip through the 
tunnels to plant the bottle was a risk 
Hugh hated to take. But he made it 
pay. He not only timed himself by 
the clocks in his room and learned 
beyond any possibility of mistake 
the rat maze he must follow but also 
he carried a practice load, a package 
of scrolls taped together to form a 
mass bigger and heavier, he felt 
sure, than one of his infant sons 
would be. This he tied to his chest 
with a sling made of stolen cloth; 
it had been a dust cover for the 
scroll printer in his offices. He made 
two such slings, one for Barbara, 
and tore and tied them such that 
they could be shifted to the back 
later to permit the babies to bo 
carried papoose style. 



He found that it was difficult but 
not impossible to carry a baby in 
this fashion through the low tun- 
nels, and he spotted the places where 
it was necessary to inch forward 
with extreme care not to place any 
pressure on his dummy “precious 
burden” and still not let the ties on 
his back catch on engineering fit- 
tings above him. 

But it could be done and he got 
back to his rooms without waking 
Kitten — he had increased her eve- 
ning bonus of Happiness. He re- 
placed the scrolls hid his knife and 
spherical lamp, washed his knees 
and elbows and anointed them, then 
sat down and wrote a long P.S. to 
the letter he had written earlier to 
tell Barbara how to find the bottle. 
This postscript added some after- 
thoughts about the philosophy of 
Hemingway and remarked that it 
seemed odd that a writer would in 
one story say that “freedom is a 
lonely thing” and in another story 
state that — and so on. 

That night he gave Kitten her 
usual amplified nightcap, then said, 
“Not much left in this bottle. Finish 
it off and I’ll get a fresh one to- 
morrow.” 

“Oh, I’d get terribly silly. You 
wouldn’t like me.” 

“Go ahead, drink it. Have a good 
time, live it up. What else is life 
for?” 

Half an hour later Kitten was 
more than willing to be helped to 
bed. Hugh stayed with her until she 
was snoring heavily. He covered her 
hands, stood looking down at her, 
knelt and kissed her good-bye.

A few minutes later he was down 
the first manhole with the lid closed 
over him. 

H e took off his robe, piled on it 
a bundle of what he had col- 
lected for survival — food, sandals, 
his stolen wig, two pots of servants’ 
deodorant cream into which he had 
blended brown pigment. He did not 
expect to use disguise and had little 
faith in it, but if they were over- 
taken by daylight before they were 
in the mountains, he intended to 
darken all four of them, tear their 
robes into something resembling the 
breechclout and wrap-around which 
he had learned were the working 
clothes of free peasant farmers 
among the Chosen — “poor black 
trash” as Joe called them — and try 
to brazen it out, keeping away from 
people if possible, until it was dark 
again. 

He tied one baby sling to him with 
the other inside it and started. He 
hurried, as time was everything. 
Even if Barbara managed to pass 
out her roommates promptly, even 
if he had no trouble breaking out 
at his preferred exit, even if the 
crawl back through the tunnels could 
be made in less than an hour — 
doubtful, with the kids — they could 
not be outdoors earlier than mid- 
night, which allowed them five hours 
of darkness to reach wild country. 
Could he hope for three miles an 
hour? Tt seemed unlikely, Barbara 
barefooted and both carrying kids, 
the country unknown and dark — 
and those moutains seen from his 
window seemed to be at least fif- 



teen miles away. It would be a 
narrow squeak even if everything 
broke his way. 

He made fast time to sluts’ quar- 
ters, punishing his knees and elbows. 

The bottle was missing, he could 
feel the tacky places where he had 
fastened it. He settled himself as 
comfortably as possible and con- 
centrated on quieting his pounding 
heart, slowing his breathing, and 
relaxing. He tried to make his mind 
blank. 

He actually dozed off. But he was 
instantly alert when the lid over him 
was raised. 

Barbara made no sound. She 
handed him one of their sons, he 
stuffed the limp little body as far 
down the tunnel as he could reach. 
She handed him the other, he placed 
it beside the first, then added a 
pitiful little bundle she had. 

But he did not kiss her until they 
were both down inside — only sec- 
onds after he had wakened — and 
the lid had clicked into place over 
them. 

She clung to him, sobbing; he 
whispered fiercely not to make a 
sound, then added last-minute in- 
structions into her ear. She quieted 
instantly, nodded acknowledgement; 
they got busy. 

It was agonizingly difficult to get 
ready for the crawl in a space too 
small for either of them and nearly 
impossible for them both. They did 
it because they had to. First he help- 
ed her get out of the shorter gar- 
ment sluts wore, then he had her 
lie down with her legs back in the 
other reach of the tunnel while he

IF 




Hcd a baby sling to her, then a baby 
was stuffed into each sling and the 
knots tightened to keep each child 
^ng as firmly in its little hammock 
as possible. Barbara’s baggage was a 
problem Hugh soived by knotting 
Ac skirt of her garment together, 
stuffing her hoarded food into the 
sack thus formed, tying the sleeves 
around his left leg and letting it 
drag behind. He had planned to tie 
ft around his waist, but the sleeves 
were too short. 

That done (it seemed to take 
hours), he had Barbara back up 
into the far reach of the tunnel, 
Aen managed most painfully to turn 
himself around and get headed the 
right way without banging little 
Hughie^s skull. Or was it Karl Jo- 
seph? He had forgotten to ask. 
Either one, the baby’s warm body 
against his, its lightly sensed breath- 
ing, gave him fresh courage. By 
God, they would make it! Whatever 
got in his way would die. 

H e set out, with the light in his 
teeth, moving very fast when- 
ever clearance let him do so without 
danger to the child. He did not 
slow down for Barbara and had 
warned her that he would not unless 
she called out. 

She did not, ever. Once her bag- 
gage worked loose from his leg. 
They stopped and he had her tie it 
to his ankle; that was their only 
rest. They made good time but it 
seemed forever before he reached 
Ae little pile of plunder. 

They unslung the babies and 
caught their breaths. 



Then he helped Barbara back into 
her shift, rearranged her sling to 
carry her one baby papoose fashion, 
and made up their luggage into one 
bundle. All that he held out was 
his knife, still taped to his arm, his 
robe, and the light. He showed her 
how to hold the light in her mouth, 
then spread her lips and let the 
tiniest trickle leak out between her 
teeth. She tried it. 

“You look ghastly,” he whis- 
pered. “Like a jack o’ lantern. But 
it’s better than a flashlight. No 
hands. Now listen carefully. Fm 
going up. You be ready to hand me 
my robe instantly. I may reconnoit- 
er.” 

“I could help you get it on, right 
here.” 

“No, because if Fm caught com- 
ing out, there will be a fight and 
it would slow me down. But I won’t 
want it, probably, until we reach a 
storeroom that is our next fairly safe 
place. If it’s all clear above, Fll want 
you to hand out everything fast, in- 
cluding the baby who’s not on your 
back. But you will have to carry him 
as well as the bundle and my robe; 
Fve got to have both hands free. 
Darling, I don’t want to kill any- 
body but if anyone is unlucky 
enough to get in our way, I will. 
You understand that, don’t you?” 

She nodded. “So I carry every- 
thing. Can do, my husband.” 

“You follow me, fast. It’s about 
two city blocks to that storeroom 
and we probably won’t see or hear 
anyone. I jiggered the lock on it late 
Ais afternoon, stuffed a wad of 
Kitten’s chewing gum into it. Once

insidi rearrange things and see 
if you can wear my sandals.” 
“My feet are all right. Feel.” 
“Maybe we’ll take turns wearing 
them. Never mind. I then have to 
break a lock on a delivery door but 
I spotted some steel bars a week ago 
which ought still to be there. Any- 
how, I’ll break out. Then away we 
go, as fast as we can trot. It should 
be breakfast time before we are 
missed, sometime after that before 
they are sure we are gone, still long- 
er before a chase is organized. We’ll 
make it.” 

“Sure we will.” 

“Just one thing. If I reach for 
my robe and then close the lid on 
you, stay here. Don’t make a sound, 
don’t try to peek out.” 

“I won’t.” 



lips. I’m going to sneak a peek.” 
He raise the lid a quarter of an 
inch, then lowered it. “In luck,” he 
whispered. “Even the standing light 
is out. Here I go. Be ready to hand 
things up fast. Joey first. And don’t 
show a light.” 

He pushed the lid up and flat 
down without a sound, raised him- 
self, got his feet to the corridor floor, 

A light him. “That’s far enough,” 
a dry voice said. “Doti’t move.” 
He kicked the whip hand so fast 
that the whip flew aside as he clos- 
ed Then this — and that — and sure 
enough! The man’s neck was brok- 
en, just as the book said it would be. 

Instantly he knelt down. “Every- 
thing out! Fast!” 

Barbara did not answer; she shov- 



“I might be gone an hour. I might ed baby and baggage up to him, was 




fake a belly ache and have to see 
the vet, then come back.” 

“All right,” 

“Barbara, it might even be twenty- 
four hours, if anything goes wrong. 
Can you stay here and keep quiet 
and keep the twins quiet that long? 
If you must?” 

“Whatever it takes, Hugh.” 

He kissed her. “Now put the light 
back in your mouth and close your 



out fast as he took her hand. “Some 
light,” he whispered. “His went out 
and I’ve got to dispose of him.” 

She gave him light. 

Memtok — 

Hugh quelled his surprise, stuffed 
the body down the hole, closed the 
lid. Barbara was ready, baby on 
back, baby in left arm, bundle in 
right. “We go on! Stay close on my 
heels!” He set out for the intersec- 



tion, holding his course in the dark 
by finger tips on the wall. 

He never saw the whip that got 
him. All he knew was the pain. 

XX 

F or a long time Mr. Hugh Fam- 
ham was aware of nothing but 
pain. When it eased off, he found 
that he was in a confinement cell 
like the one in which he had lived 
his first days under the Protectorate 
— possibly the same one. 

He was there three days. He 
thought it was three days, as he was 
fed six times. He always knew when 
they were about to feed him — and 
to empty his slop jar, for he was 
not taken outside for any purpose. 
He would find himself restrained by 
that invisible spider web, then some- 
one would come inside, leave food, 
replace the slop jar, and go. He soon 
learned that it was impossible to get 
the servant who did this to answer 
him. 

After what might have been three 
days he found himself unexpectedly 
caught up by that prisoning field (he 
had just been fed) and his old col- 
league and “cousin” the Chief Vet- 
erinary ' came in. Hugh had more 
Aan a suspicion as to why; his feel- 
ing amounted to a conviction, so 
he pleaded, demanded to be taken 
to the Lord Protector and finally 
shouted. 

The surgeon ignored it. He did 
something to Hugh’s thigh, then left. 

To Hugh’s limited relief he did 
not become unconscious, but he 
found, when the tanglefoot field let 



up, that he could not move anyhow 
and that he felt lethargic. Shortly 
two servants came in, picked him up, 
placed him in a box all too much 
like a coffin. 

Hugh found that he was being 
shipped somewhere. His shipping 
case was given casual but not rough 
handling; once he felt a lift surge 
to a stop; his boX was placed in 
something; and some minutes, hours, 
or days later it was moved again; 
and presently he was dumped into 
another confinement room. 

He knew it was a different one; 
the walls were light green instead of 
white. By the time they fed him 
he had recovered and was again 
“tangled” while food was placed 
inside. 

This went on for one hundred and 
twenty-two meals. Hugh kept track 
by biting a chunk out of his too- 
long finger nails and scratching the 
inside of his left arm. This took 
him less than five minutes each day; 
he spent the rest of his time worry- 
ing and sometimes sleeping. Sleeping 
was worse than worrying because 
he always re-enacted his escape at- 
tempt in his sleep and it always 
ended in disaster — although not 
necessarily at the same point. He did 
not always kill his friend the Chief 
Domestic and at least twice they 
got all the way to the mountains 
before they were caught. 

But, long or short, it ended the 
same way and he would wake up 
sobbing and calling for Barbara. 

He worried most about Barbara 
— and the twins, although the boys 
were not as real to him. He had 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 



105 




never heard of a slut being severely 
punished for anything. However, he 
had never heard of a slut being in- 
volved in an attempted escape and 
a killing, either; he just did not 
know. But he did know that the 
Lord Protector preferred slut meat 
for his table. 

He tried to tell himself that old 
Ponse, whatever he did, would do 
nothing to a slut while she was still 
nursing babies — and that would 
be a long time yet; among servants, 
according to Kitten, mothers nursed 
babies for at least two years. 

He worried about Kitten, too. 
Would the child be punished for 
something she had nothing to do 
with? A completely innocent by- 
stander. Again he did not know. 
There was “justice” here; it was a 
major branch of religious writings. 
But he also knew that it resembled 
so little the concept “justice” of his 
own culture that he had found the 
stuff almost unreadable. 

H e spent most of his time on what 
he thought of as “constructive” 
worry, i.e., what he should have 
done rather than what he had done. 

He saw now that his plans had 
been laughably inadequate. He 
should never let himself be panicked 
into moving .too soon. It would have 
been far better to have built up his 
connection with Joe, never dis- 
agreed with him, tickled his vanity, 
gone to work for him and, in time, 
prevailed on him to adopt Barbara 
and the kids. Joe was an accommo- 
dating person and old Ponse was so 
open-handed that he might simply 



have made Joe a present of these 
three useless servants instead of de- 
manding cash. The boys would have 
been in no danger for years (and 
perhaps never in danger if Joe own- 
ed them), and, in time, Hugh could 
have expected to become a trusted 
business servant, with a broad pass 
allowing him to go anywhere on his 
master’s business — and Hugh would 
have acquired sophisticated knowl- 
edge of how this world worked that 
a house servant could never acquire. 

Once he learned exactly how it 
ticked, he could have planned an 
escape that would work. 

Any society man has ever devised, 
he reminded himself, could be brib- 
ed — and a servant who handles 
money can find ways to steal some. 
Probably there was an “underground 
railroad” that ran to the moun- 
tains. Yes, he had been far too hasty. 

He considered, too, the wider 
aspects — a slave uprising. He vis- 
ualized those tunnel being used not 
for escape but as a secret meeting 
place. Classes in reading and writ- 
ing, taught in whispers; oaths as 
mighty as a Mau Mau initiation 
binding the conspirators as blood 
brothers, with each Chosen having 
marked against his name a series 
of dedicated assassins, servants pa- 
tiently and slowly grinding scraps 
of metal into deadly knives. 

This “constructive” dream he en- 
joyed most — and believed in least. 

Would these docile sheep ever 
rebel? It seemed unlikely. He had 
been classed with them by accident 
of complexion but they were not 
of his breed even though he did not 



106 



IP 




doubt that they were of his ancestry. 
Centuries of selective breeding had 
made them something else, as little 
like himself as a lap dog is like a 
timber wolf. 

And yet, and yet, how did he 
know? He knew only the tempered 
males, and the few studs he had 
seen had all been dulled by a liberal 
ration of “Happiness” — to say 
nothing of what it might do to a 
man’s fighting spirit to lose his 
thumbs at an early age and be driven 
around with whips-that-were-more- 
than-whips. 

This matter of racial differences 

— or the equally nonsense notion of 
“racial equality” — had never been 
examined scientifically; there was 
too much emotion on both sides. 
Nobody wanted honest data. 

Hugh recalled an area in Pernam- 
buco he had seen while in the Navy, 
a place where the rich plantation 
owners, dignified, polished, educated 
in France, were all black, while their 
servants and field hands — giggling, 
shuffling, shiftless knuckleheads “ob- 
viously” incapable of better things 

— were mostly white men. 

He had stopped telling this anec- 
dote in the States. It was never really 
believed and it was almost always 
resented — even by Whites who 
made a big thing of how anxious 
they were to “help the American 
Negro improve himself.” Hugh had 
formed the opinion that almost all 
of these bleeding hearts wanted the 
Negro’s lot improved until it was 
almost as high as their own — and 
no longer on their consciences. But 
the idea that the tables could ever 



be fully turned was one they re- 
jected emotionally. 

Hugh knew that the tables could 
indeed be turned. He had seen it 
that once, now he was experiencing 
it. 

But Hugh knew that the situation 
was still more confused. Many Ro- 
man citizens had been “black as the 
ace of spades” and many slaves of 
Romans had been as blond as Hitler 
wanted to be — so any “white man” 
of European ancestry was certain 
to have a dash of Negro blood. 
Sometimes more than a dash. That 
southern Senator, what was his 
name? — the one who had built his 
career on “white supremacy.” Hugh 
had come across two sardonic facts: 
This old boy had died from cancer 
of the jaw and had had many blood 
tranfusions — and his blood type 
was such that the chances were 
two hundred to one that its owner 
had not just a touch of the tar brush 
but practically the whole tar barrel. 
A Navy surgeon had gleefully point- 
ed this out to Hugh and had proved 
both points in medical literature. 

Nevertheless, this confused mat- 
ter of races would never be straight- 
ened out — because almost nobody 
wanted the truth. 

Take this matter of singing. It 
had seemed self-evident to Hugh 
that Negroes of his time averaged 
better singers than had whites; most 
people seemed to think so and Hugh 
felt such a preference. Yet the very 
persons, white or black, who insist- 
ed most loudly that “all races were 
equal” always seemed happy to 
agree that Negroes were superior. 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



107 




on the average, in this one way. 
It reminded Hugh of Orwell’s Ani- 
mal Farm, in which “All Animals 
Are Equal But Some Are More 
Equal Than Others.” 

Well, he knew who wasn’t equal 
here — despite his statistically cer- 
tain drop or more of black blood. 
Hugh Farnham, namely. He found 
that he agreed with Joe; When 
things were unequal, it was much 
nicer to be on top! 

O n the sixty-first day in this new 
place, if it was the sixty-first, 
they came for him, bathed him, cut 
his finger and toe nails, rubbed him 
all over with deodorant cream, and 
paraded him before the Lord Pro- 
tector. 

Hugh learned that he still could 
be humiliated by not being given 
even a night shirt as clothing, but 
he conceded that it was a reasonable 
precaution in handling a prisoner 
who killed with his bare hands. His 
escort were two young Chosen, in 
uniforms which Hugh assumed to 
be military, and the whips they 
carried were definitely not “lesser 
whips.” 

The route they followed was very 
long; it was clearly a huge building. 
The room where he was finally de- 
livered was very like in spirit (al- 
though different in detail) to the 
informal lounge where Hugh had 
once played bridge. The big view 
window looked out over a wide 
tropical river. 

Hugh hardly glanced at it; the 
Lord Protector was there. And so 
were Barbara and the twins! 



The babies were crawling on the 
floor. But Barbara was breast deep 
in that invisible quicksand, a trap 
that claimed Hugh as soon as he 
was halted. She smiled at him but 
did not speak. He looked her over 
carefully. She seemed unhurt and 
healthy, but she was thin and had 
deep circles under her eyes. 

He started to speak; she gestured 
warningly with eyes and head. Hugh 
then looked at the Lord Protector 
— and noticed only then that Joe 
was lounging near him and that 
Grace and Duke were playing some 
card game over in a corner, both 
of them chewing gum and both 
ostentatiously not seeing that Hugh 
was there. He looked back at Their 
Charity. 

Hugh decided that Ponse had 
been ill. Despite the fact that Hugh 
felt comfortably warm in skin Ponse 
was wearing a full robe with a shawl 
over his lap and he looked, for once, 
almost his reputed age. 

But when he spoke, his voice was 
still resonant. “You may go. Cap- 
tain. We excuse you.” 

The escort withdrew. Their Char- 
ity looked Hugh over soberly. At 
last he said, “Well, boy, you cer- 
tainly made a mess of things, didn’t 
you?” He looked down and played 
with something in his lap, caught 
it and pulled it back to the middle 
of the shawl. Hugh saw that it was 
a white mouse. He felt sudden sym- 
pathy for the mouse. It didn’t seem 
to like where it was, but if it did 
manage to escape, the cats would 
quickly get it. Maggie was watch- 
ing with deep interest. 



108 



IF 




Hugh did not answer, the re- 
nark seemed rhetorical. But it had 
•tartled him very much. Ponse cov- 
ered the mouse with his hand, 
looked up. “Well? Say something!” 

“You speak English!” 

4CT^on’t look so silly. Of course 
I do. I’m a scholar, Hugh. 
Do you think I would let myself 
be surrounded by people who speak 
a language I don’t understand? I 
speak it, and I read it, silly as the 
spelling is. I’ve been tutored daily 
by skilled scholars — plus conversa- 
tion practice with a living diction- 
ary.” He jerked his head toward 
Grace. “Couldn’t you guess that I 
would want to read those books of 
mine? Not be dependent on your 
hit-or-miss translations? I’ve read 
the ‘Just So Stories’ twice. Charm- 
ing!” 

He shifted back to Language. 
“But we are not here to discuss lit- 
erature.” Their Charity barely ges- 
tured. Four slut servants came run- 
ning in with a table, placed it in 
front of the big man, placed things 
on it. Hugh recognized them all — 
a homemade knife, a wig, two pots 
for deodorant cream, a bundle that 
would be food, an empty Happiness 
bottle, a' little white sphere now 
dull, a pair of sandals, two robes, 
one long, one short, and both muss- 
ed and rather dirty, and a surpris- 
ingly high stack of paper, creased 
and much written on. 

Ponse put the white mouse on the 
table, stirred the display of exhibits, 
said broodingly, “I’m no fool, Hugh. 
Fve owned servants all my life. I 
had you figured out before you had 



yourself figured out. Doesn’t do to 
let a man like you mingle with loyal 
servants, he corrupts them. Gives 
them ideas they are better off with- 
out. I had planned to let you escape 
as soon as I was through with you. 
You could have afforded to wait.” 

“Do you expect me to believe 
that?” 

Doesn’t matter whether you do 
or don’t. It’s the truth. I could not 
afford to have you very long — one 
bad apple rots the rest, as my uncle 
was fond of saying. Nor could I put 
you up for adoption and let some 
unwitting buyer pay good money for 
a servant who would then corrupt 
others elsewhere in my realm. No, 
you had to escape.” 

“Even if that is so, I would never 
have escaped without Barbara and 
my boys.” 

“I said I am not a fool. Kindly 
remember it. Of course you would 
not. I was going to use Barba — 
and these darling brats — to force 
you to escape. At my selected time. 
Now you’ve ruined it. I must make 
an example of you. For the benefit 
of the other servants.” He frowned 
and picked up the crude knife. 
“Poor balance. Hugh, did you really 
expect to make it with this pitiful 
tackle? Not even shoes for that child 
by you. If only you had waited a 
decent time, you would have been 
given opportunity to steal what you 
really needed.” 

“Ponse, you are playing with me 
the way you’ve been playing with 
that mouse. You weren’t planning 
to let us escape. Not really escape 
at least. I would have wound up on 
your table.”

'Tlease!” The old man made a 
grimace of distaste. '‘Hugh, Pm not 
well, someone has again been try- 
ing to poison me — my nephew, I 
suppose — and this time almost suc- 
ceeded. So don’t talk nasty, it upsets 
my stomach.” He looked Hugh up 
and down. 'Tough. Inedible. An 
old stud savage is merely garbage. 
Much too gamy. Besides that, a 
gentleman doesn’t eat members of 
his own family, no matter what. 
The thought is repugnant to me. So 
let’s not talk in bad taste. There’s 
no cause for you to bristle so. I’m 
not angry with you, just very, very 
provoked.” He glanced at the 
twins, said, “Hughie, stop pulling 
Maggie’s tail.” His voice was neither 
loud nor sharp; the baby stopped at 
once. “Admittedly those two would 
make tasty appetizers were they not 
of my household. But even had they 
not been, I would have planned 
better things for them; they are so 
cute and so much alike. Did plan 
better things at first. Until it be- 
came clear that they were necessary 
to forcing you to run.” 

P onse sighed. “I can see that you 
still do not believe a word I’m 
saying. Hugh, you don’t understand 
the system. Well, servants never do. 
Did you ever grow apples?” 

“No.” 

“A good eating apple, firm and 
sweetly tart, is never a product of 
nature. It is the result of long de- 
velopment under careful control 
from something small and sour and 
hard and hardly fit for animal fod- 
der. Then it has to be scientifically 
propagated and protected. On the 



other hand, too highly developed 
plants — or animals — can go bad, 
lose their firmness, their flavor, get 
mushy and soft and worthless. It’s 
a nice two-horned problem. We have 
it constantly with servants. On the 
one hand you must weed out the 
rebels, the troublemakers, not let 
them breed. On the other hand 
these very troublemakers, the worst 
of them, are invaluable breeding 
stock that must not be lost. So we 
do both. The run-of-the-crop bad 
ones we temper and keep. The very 
worst ones — such as you — we en- 
courage to run. If you live — and 
some of you do — we can rescue 
you, or your strong get, at a later 
time and add you in, judiciously, to 
a breeding line that has become so 
soft and docile and stupid that it 
is no longer worth its keep. Our 
poor friend Memtok was a result 
of such pepping up of the breed. 
One quarter savage he was. He 
never knew it of course — and a 
good stud that added strength to a 
line. But far too dangerous and 
ambitious to be kept too long at 
stud; he had to be made to see the 
advantages of being tempered. Most 
of my upper servants have a recent 
strain of savage in them. Some of 
them are Memtok’s sons. My engi- 
neer, for example. No, Hugh, you 
would not have wound up on any- 
body’s table. Nor tempered. I would 
like to have kept you as a pet, you’re 
diverting — and a fair bridge hand 
in the bargain. But I could not let 
you stay in contact with my loyal 
servants. Presently you would have 
been put in touch with the under- 
ground.”

IF 




Hugh opened his mouth and clos- 
ed it. 

“Surprised, eh? But there is al- 
ways an underground, throughout 
history, wherever there is a ruling 
class and a serving class. Which is 
to say, always. If there were not an 
underground, it would be necessary 
to invent one. However, since there 
is one, we keep track of it, subsi- 
dize it — and use it. In the upper 
servants’ mess its contact is the vet- 
erinary — trusted by everyone and 
quite shamelessly free of sentiment. 
I don’t like him. But if you had 
confided in him, you would have 
been guided, advised, and helped. 
I would have used you to cover 
about a hundred sluts, then sent you 
on your way. Don’t look started. 
Even Their Mercy uses studs who 
have to stoop a bit to get through 
the studs’ door when a freshening of 
the line is indicated — and there 
was always the danger that you 
might get you yourself, and those 
dear boys, killed, and thereby have 
wasted your fine potential.” 

T heir Charity picked up the pile 
of Kitten-delivered mail. “These 
things — All my Chief Domestic 
was expected to do was to thwart 
you frofn doing something silly; he 
never knew the veterinary’s second 
function. Why, I even had to crack 
down on Memtok a bit to turn his 
copies of these things over to me — 
when anyone could have guessed 
that a stud like you would find a 
way to get in touch with his slut. 
I deduced that it would happen that 
time that you stood up to me about 
her, our first bridge game. Remem- 



ber? Perhaps you don’t. But 1 sent 
for Memtok, and sure enough, you 
had already started. Although he 
was reluctant to admit it, since he 
had not reported it.” 

Hugh was hardly listening. He 
was turning over in his mind the 
glaring fact that he was hearing 
things told only to dead men. None 
of the four of them was going to 
leave this room alive. No, perhaps 
the twins would. Yes, Ponse wanted 
the breeding line. But he — and 
Barbara, too — would never have a 
chance to talk. 

But Ponse was saying. “You still 
have a chance to correct your mis- 
takes. And you made lots of them. 
One note you wrote my scholars 
assured me was gibberish, not En- 
glish at all. So I knew it was a 
secret message whether we could 
read it or not. So thereafter all your 
notes were subjected to careful an- 
alysis, not just reading. So of course 
we found the key — rather naive to 
be considered a code, rather clever 
considering the handicaps. And 
very useful to me. But confound it, 
Hugh, it cost me! Memtok was 
naive about savages, he did not rea- 
lize that they fight when cornered.” 

Ponse scowled. “Damn you, 
Hugh, your recklessness cost me a 
valuable property. I wouldn’t have 
taken ten thousand bullocks for 
Memtok’s adoption — no, not twen- 
ty. And now your life is forfeit. The 
purely technical charge of attempt- 
ing to run we could overlook, a ting- 
ling in front of the other servants 
would cover that. Destroying your 
master’s property we could even 
cover up if it had been done secret-

ly. Did you know that that bed- 
warmer I lent you knew most of 
what you were up to? Saw much of 
it? Sluts gossip.” 

“She told you?” 

“No, damn it, it didn’t tell the 
half; we had to tingle it out of it. 
Then it turned out it knew so much 
that we could not afford to have 
it talking and the other servants put- 
ting one and one together. So it had 
to go.” 

“You had her killed.” Hugh felt a 
surge of disgust and said it, know- 
ing that nothing he said could matter 
now. 

“What’s it to you? Its life was 
forfeit, treason to its master. How- 
ever, I’m not a spiteful man, the 
little critter has no moral sense and 
didn’t know what it was doing — 
you must have hypnotized it, Hugh 
— and I am a frugal man; I don’t 
uselessly waste property. It’s adopt- 
ed so far away now that it’ll have 
trouble understanding the accent, 
much less have its stories believed.” 

Hugh sighed. “I’m relieved.” 

“Choice about the slut, eh? Was 
it that good?” 

“She was innocent. I didn’t want 
her hurt.” 

“As may be. Now, Hugh, you can 
repair all this costly mess. Pay me 
back the damage and do yourself a 
good turn at the same time.” 

“How?”- 

“Quite simple. You’ve cost me 
my key executive servant, I’ve no one 
of his caliber to replace him. So you 
take his place, that’s all. No scan- 
dal, no fuss, no upset below stairs — 
every servant who saw any piece of 
it is already adopted away. And you 



can tell any story you like about 
what happened to Memtok. Or even 
claim you don’t know. Barba, can 
you refrain from gossip?” 

“I certainly can where Hugh’s 
welfare is concerned.” 

“That’s a good child. I would 
hate to have you muted, it would 
hamper our bridge game. Although 
Hugh will be rather busy for bridge. 
Hugh, here’s the honey that trapped 
the bear. You take over as Chief 
Domestic, do the kind of job I 
know you can do once you learn the 
details — and Barba and the twins 
live with you. What you always 
wanted. Well, that’s the choice. Be 
my boss servant and have them with 
you. Or your lives are forfeit. What 
do you say?” 

H ugh Farnham was so dazed that 
he was gulping, trying to ac- 
cept, when Their Charity added, 
“Just one thing. I won’t be able to 
let you have them with you right 
away.” 

“No?” 

“No. I still want to breed a few 
from you, before you are tempered. 
Needn’t be long, if you are as spry 
as you look.” 

Barbara said, “No!” 

But Hugh Farnham was making a 
terrible decision. “Wait, Barbara. 
Ponse. What about the boys? Will 
they be tempered, too?” 

“Oh.’^ Ponse thought about it. 
“You drive a hard bargain, Hugh. 
Suppose we say that they will not 
be. Let’s say that I might use them 
at stud a bit — but not take their 
thumbs; it would be a dead give- 
away for so private a purpose with 



112 



IF 




studs as tall as they are going to be. 
Then at fourteen or fifteen I let 
them escape. Does that suit you?” 
The old man stopped to cough; a 
painful spasm racked him. “Damn 
it, you’re tiring me.” 

Hugh pondered it. “Ponse, you 
may not be alive fourteen or fif- 
teen years from now.” 

“True. But it is very impolite for 
you to say so.” 

“Can you bind this bargain for 
your heir? Mrika?” 

Ponse rubbed his hair and grin- 
ned. “You’re a sharp one, Hugh. 
What a Chief Domestic you will 
make! Of course I can’t — which is 
why I want some get from you, with- 
out waiting for the boys to mature. 
But there is always a choice, just as 
you have a choice now. I can see 
to it that you are in my heavenly 
escort. All of you, the boys, too. Or 
I can have you all kept alive and 
you can work out a new bargain, if 
any. ‘Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi’ 
— which was the ancients’ way of 
saying that when the protector leaves 
there is always a new protector. Just 
tell me. I’ll do it either way.” 
Hugh was thinking over the grim 
choices when Barbara again spoke 
up. “Their Charity — ” 

“Yes,^ child?” 

“You had better have my tongue 
cut out. Right now, before you let 
me leave this room. Because I will 
have nothing to do with this wick- 
ed scheme. And I will not keep 
quiet. No!” 

“Barba, Barba, that’s not being a 
good girl.” 

“I am not a girl. I am a woman 
and a wife and a mother! I will 



never call you ‘uncle’ a^ain — you* 
are vile! I will not play bridge with 
you ever again, with or without my 
tongue. We are helpless . but I 
will give you nothing. What is this 
you offer? You want my husband to 
agree to this evil thing in exchange 
for a few scant years of life for 
me and our sons — for as long as 
God lets that evilness you call your 
body continue to breathe. Then 
what? You cheat him even then. We 
die. Or we are left to the mercy 
of your nephew who is even worse 
than you are. Oh, I know! The bed- 
warmers all hate him, they weep 
when they are called to serve him — 
and weep even harder when they 
come back. But I would not let Hugh 
make this choice even if you could 
promise us all a lifetime of luxury. 
No! I won’t, I won’t! You try to 
do it. I’ll kill my babies! Then my- 
self. Then Hugh will kill himself I 
know! No matter what you have 
done to him!” She stopped, spat as 
far as she could in the old man’s 
direction, then burst into tears. 

Their Charity said, “Hughie, I 
told you to stop teasing that cat. 
It will scratch you.” Slowly he 
stood up, said, “Reason with them, 
Joe,” and left the room. 

J oe sighed and came over close to 
them. “Barbara,” he said gently, 
“take hold of yourself. You aren’t 
acting in Hugh’s interests even if you 
think you are. You should advise 
him to take it. After all, a man 
Hugh’s age doesn’t have much to 
lose by it.” 

Barbara looked at him as if she 
had never seen him before in her 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 



113 




life. Then she spat again. Joe was 
close, she got him in the face. 

He jumped and raised his hand. 
Hugh said sharply, ‘‘Joe, if you hit 
her and I ever get loose, I’ll break 
your arm.” 

“I wasn’t going to hit her,” Joe 
said slowly. “I was just going to 
wipe my face. I wouldn’t hit Bar- 
bara, Hugh; I admire her. I just 
don’t think she has good sense.” He 
took a kerchief to the smear of 
saliva. “I guess there is no arguing.” 

“None, Joe. I’m sorry I spit on 
you.” 

“That’s all right, Barbara. You’re 
upset . and you never treated me 
as a nigger, ever. Well, Hugh?” 

“Barbara has decided it. And she 
always means what she says. I can’t 
say that I’m sorry. Staying alive 
here just isn’t worth it, for any of 
us. Even if I was not to be temper- 
ed.” 

“I hate to hear you say that, 
Hugh. All in all, you and I always 
got along pretty well. Well, if that’s 
your last word, I might as well go 
tell Their Charity. Is it?” 

“Yes ” 

“Yes, Joe.” 

“Well — Good-bye, Barbara. 
Good-bye, Hugh.” He left. 

The Lord Protector came back 
in alone, moving with the slow 
caution of a man old and sick. “So 
that’s what you’ve decided,” he said, 
sitting down and gathering the 
shawl around him. He reached out 
for the mouse, still crouching on 
the table top; servants came in and 
cleared off the table. He went on, 
“Can’t say that I’m surprised — I’ve 
played bridge with both of you. Well, 



now we take up the other choice. 
Your lives are forfeit and I can’t 
let you stay here, other than on 
those terms. So now we send you 
back.” 

“Back where, Ponse?” 

“Why, back to your own time, of 
course. If you make it. Perhaps you 
will.” He stroked the mouse. “This 
little fellow made it. Two weeks at 
least. And it didn’t hurt him. 
Though one can only guess what 
two thousand years would do.” 

The servants were back in and 
were piling on the table a man’s 
watch, a Canadian dime, a pair of 
much worn mountain boots, a hunt- 
ing knife, some badly made moc- 
casins, a pair of levis, some ragged 
denim shorts with a very large 
waistline, a .45 automatic pistol with 
belt, two ragged and faded shirts, 
one somewhat altered, a part of a 
paper of matches and a small note- 
book and pencil. 

Ponse looked at the collection. 
“Was there anything else?” He slid 
the loaded clip from the pistol, held 
it in his hand. “If not, get dressed.” 
The invisible field let them loose. 

XXI 

iiT don’t see what there is to be 
-I- surprised about,” Ponse told 
them. “Hugh, you will remember 
that I told my scientists that I want- 
ed to know how you got here. No 
miracles. I told them rather firmly. 
They understood I would be most 
unhappy — and vexed — if the Pro- 
tectorate’s scientists could not solve 
it when they had so many hints, so 
much data. So they did. Probably. 



114 



IF 




At least they were able to move this 
little fellow. He arrived today, which 
is why I sent for you today. Now 
we will find out if it works back- 
ward in time as well as forwards — 
and if the big apparatus works as 
well as the bench model. I under- 
stand it is not so much the amount 
of power — no atom-kernel bombs 
necessary — as the precise applica- 
tion of power. But we’ll soon know.” 
Hugh asked, ''How will you 
know? We will know — if it works. 
But how will you know?” 

"Oh, that. My scientists are really 
quite clever, when they have in- 
centive. One of them will explain 
it.” 

The scientists were called in, two 
Chosen and five servants. There 
was of course no introduction; Hugh 
found himself treated as imperson- 
ally as the little white mouse who 
still tried to meet his death on the 
floor, but was restrained. Hugh was 
required to take off his shirt and 
two servant-scientists taped a small 
package to Hugh’s right shoulder. 
‘What’s that?” It seemed surprising- 
ly heavy for its size. 

The servants did not answer; the 
leading Chosen said, "You will be 
told. Come here. See this.” 

"This” turned out to be Hugh’s 
former property, a U.S. Geodetic 
Survey map of James County.' "Do 
you understand this? Or must we 
explain it?” 

"I understand it.” Hugh used the 
equal mode. The Chosen ignored it 
while continuing to speak in pro- 
tocol mode, falling. 

"Then you know that here is 
where you arrived.” 



Hugh agreed, as the man’s finger 
covered the spot where Hugh’s home 
had once stood. The Chosen nodded 
thoughtfully and added, "Do you 
understand the meaning of these 
marks?” He pointed to a tiny x- 
mark and very small figures beside 
it. 

"Certainly. We call that a ‘bench 
mark.* Exact location and altitude. 
It”s a reference point for all the rest 
of the map.” 

"Excellent.” The Chosen now 
pointed to a similar mark at the 
summit of Mount James as shown 
by the map. “Now, tell us, if you 
know — but don’t lie about it; it 
will not advantage you — how much 
error there would be, horizontally 
and vertically, between these two 
reference points.” 

Hugh thought about it, held up 
bis thumb and forefinger about an 
inch apart. The Chosen blinked. "It 
would not have been that accurate 
in those primitive times. We assume 
that you are lying. Try again. Or 
admit that you don’t know.” 

"And I suggest that you don’t 
know what you are talking about. 
It would be at least that accurate. 
Probably much closer.” Hugh 
thought of telling him that he had 
bossed surveying parties in the Sea- 
bees and had done much of his own 
surveying when he was getting start- 
ed as a contractor — and that while 
he did not know how accurate a 
government geodetic survey was, he 
did know that enormously more ac- 
curate methods had been used in 
setting those bench marks than were 
ever used in the ordinary (quite 
accurate) survey. 



FARNMAM^S FREEHOLD 



115 




But he decided that explanation 
would be wasted. 

T he Chosen looked at him, then 
glanced at Their Charity. The 
old man had been listening but his 
face showed nothing. “Very well. 
We will assume that the marks are 
accurate, each to the other. Which 
is fortunate, as this one is missing 
— ” he pointed to the first one, near 
where Hugh’s home had been — 
“whereas this one — ” he indicated 
the summit of Mount James — “is 
still in place, in solid rock. Now 
search your memory and do not lie 
again, as it will matter to you . 
and it will matter to Their Charity 
and to us, as a silly lie on your 
part could waste much effort and 
Their Charity would be much dis- 
pleased, we are certain. Where, quite 
near this reference mark and the 
same height — certainly no higher! 
— is — was, I mean, in those pri- 
mitive times — a flat, level place?” 
Hugh thought about it. He knew 
exactly where that bench mark had 
been : in the cornerstone of the 
Southport Savings Bank. It was, or 
had been, a small brass plate, let 
into the stone beside the larger de- 
dication plate, about eighteen inches 
above the sidewalk at the north- 
east corner of the bank building. It 
had been placed there shortly after 
the Southport shopping center had 
been built. Hugh had often glanced 
at it in passing; it had always given 
him a warm feeling of stability to 
note a bench mark. 

The bank had sided on a parking 
lot shared by the bank, a Safeway 
Supermarket, and a couple of other 



shops. “It is level and flat off this 
way for a distance of — ’’(Hugh 
estimated the width of that ancient 
parking lot in feet, placed the figure 
in modern units.) “Or a little farth- 
er. That’s just an estimate, not whol- 
ly accurate.” 

“But it is flat and level? And no 
higher than this point?” 

“A little lower and sloping away. 
For drainage.” 

“Very well. Now place your at- 
tention on this configuration.” Again 
it was Hugh’s property, a Conoco 
map of the state. “That object fas- 
tened to your back you may think 
of as a clock. We will not explain it, 
you could not understand. Suffice it 
to say that radiation decay of a 
metal inside it measures time. That 
is why it is heavy; it is cased in lead 
to protect it. You will take it to 
here,'' The Chosen pointed to a 
town on the map; Hugh noted that 
it was the home of the state univer- 
sity. 

At a gesture the Chosen was hand- 
ed a slip of paper. To Hugh he said, 
“Can you read this? Do you know 
what it means? Or must it be ex- 
plained?” 

“It says ‘University State Bank,’ ” 
Hugh told him. “I seem to recall 
that there was an institution of that 
name in that town. I’m not sure, I 
don’t recall doing any business with 
it.” 

“There was,” the Chosen assured 
him, “and its ruins were recently 
uncovered. You will go to it. There 
was, and still is, a strong room, a 
vault, in its lowest part. You will 
place this clock in that vault. Do 
you understand?” 



116 



IF 




“I understand,” Hugh said. 

“By Their Charity’s wish, that 
vault has not yet been opened. After 
you have gone, it will be opened. 
The clock will be found and we will 
read it. Do you understand why 
this is crucial to the experiment? It 
will not only tell us that you made 
the time jump safely but also exactly 
how long the span was — and from 
this our instruments will be calibrat- 
ed.” The Chosen looked very fierce. 
“Do this exactly. Or you will be 
severely punished.” 

P onse caught Hugh’s eye at this 
point. The old man was not 
laughing but his eyes twinkled. “Do 
it, Hugh,” he said quietly “That’s a 
good fellow.” 

Hugh said to the Chosen scien- 
tist. “I will do it. I understand.” 
The Chosen said, “May it please 
Their Charity, this one is ready to 
weight them now, and then leave 
for the site.” 

“We’ve changed our mind,” 
Ponse announced. “We will see 
this.” He added, “Nerve in good 
shape, Hugh?” 

“Quite.” 

“All of you who made the first 
jump were given this opportunity, 
did 1 tell you? Joe turned it down 
flatly.” The old man glanced over 
his shoulder. “Grace! Changed your 
mind, little one?” 

Grace looked up “Ponsie!” she 
said reproachfully. “You know I 
would never leave you.” 

“Duke?” 

The tempered servant did not 
even look up. He simply shook his 
head. 



Ponse said to the scientist, “Let’s 
hurry and get them weighed. Wc 
intend to sleep at home tonight.” 
The weighing was done elsewhere 
in the Palace. Just before the four 
were placed on the weighing area 
the Lord Protector held up the cart- 
ridge clip he had removed from the 
pistol Hugh now wore. “Hugh? Will 
you undertake not to be foplish with 
this? Or should I have the pellets 
separated from the explosives?” 
“Uh, I’ll behave.” 

“Ah, but how will you behave? If 
you were impetuous, you might well 
succeed in killing me. But consider 
what would happen to Barba and 
our little brats.” 

(I had thought of that, you old 
scoundrel. I’ll still do exactly what 
seems best to me.) “Ponse, why 
don’t you let Barbara carry the clip 
in a pocket? That would keep me 
from loading and firing very fast 
even if I did get ideas.” 

“A good plan. Here, Barba.” 
The boss scientist seemed un- 
happy at the total weight of his 
experimental package. “May it 
please Their Charity, this one finds 
that the body weights of both adults 
must have lessened markedly since 
the time of the figures on which the 
calculations were made.” 

“And what do you expect of us?” 
“Oh, nothing, nothing, may it 
please Their Charity. Just a slight 
delay. The mass must be exact.” 
Hurriedly the Chosen started piling 
small metal discs on the platform. 

I t gave Hugh an idea. “Ponse, you 
really expect this to work?” 

“If I knew the answer to that, it 

117 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 





would not be necessary to try it. 
1 hope it will work.” 

“If it does work, we’ll need 
money right away. Especially if I’m 
to travel half across the state to bury 
this clock devise.” 

“Reasonable. You used gold, did 
you not? Or was it silver? I see your 
idea.” The old man gestured “Stop 
that weighing.” 

“We used both, sometimes, but it 
had to have our own protectorate’s 
stamp. Ponse, there were quite a 
number of American silver dollars in 
my house when you took it away 
from me. Are they available?” 

They were available and in the 
Palace and the old man had no ob- 
jection to using them to make up 
the missing weight. The boss scient- 
ist was fretted over the delay — he 
explained to his lord that the adjust- 
ments were set for an exact time 
span as well as exact mass in order 
to place these specimens at a time 
before the East-West War had start- 
ed, plus a margin for error — but 
that any delay was reducing the 
margin and might require recalcula- 
tion and long and painful recali- 
bration. Hugh did not follow the 
technicalities. 

Nor did Ponse. He cut the scient- 



ist off abruptly. “Then recalculate if 
necessary. All.” 

It took more than an hour to 
locate the man who knew where 
these particular items of the savage 
artifacts were filed, then dig them 
out and fetch them. Ponse sat brood- 
ing and playing with his mouse. 
Barbara nursed the twins, then 
changed them with the help of slut 
servants; Hugh petitioned plumbing 
calls for each of them — granted, 
under guard — and all this changed 
all the body weights and everything 
was started over again. 

The silver dollars were still in, or 
had been replaced in, the $100 rolls 
in which Hugh had hoarded them. 
They made quite a stack, and (on 
the happy assumption that the time 
jump would work) Hugh was pleas- 
ed that he had lost while imprisoned 
the considerable paunch he had re- 
grown during his easy days as “Chief 
Researcher.” However, less than 
three hundred silver dollars were 
used in bringing them up to calcu- 
lated weight — plus a metal slug and 
some snips of foil. 

“If it suits the Lord Protector, 
this one believes that the specimens 
should now be placed in the con- 
tainer without delay.” 



118 



IF 




“Then do it! Don’t waste our 
time.” 

The container was floated in. It 
was a box, metallic, plain, empty, 
and with no furnishings of any sort, 
barely high enough for Hugh to 
stand upright in, barely large 
enough for all of them. Hugh got 
into it, helped Barbara in, the babies 
were handed to them and Hughie 
started to squawl and set off his 
brother. 

Ponse looked annoyed. “My sluts 
have been spoiling those brats. 
Hugh, I’ve decided not to watch it. 
I’m weary. Good-bye to both of 
you — and good riddance; neither 
of you would ever have made a loyal 
servant. But I’ll miss our bridge 
games. Barba, you must bring those 
brats back into line. But don’t break 
their spunk doing it; They’re fine 
boys.” He turned and left abruptly. 

T he hatch was closed down on 
them and fastened; they were 
alone. Hugh at once took advantage 
of it to kiss his wife, somewhat 
hampered by each of them holding 
a baby. 

“I don’t care what happens now,” 
Barbara said as soon as her mouth 
was free. “That’s what I’ve been 
longing for. Oh, dear, Joey is wet 
again. How about Hughie?” 

“It’s unanimous. Hughie also. 
But I thought you said you didn’t 
care what happens now?” 

“Well, I don’t, really. But try ex- 
plaining that to a baby. I would 
gladly swap one of these rolls of 
dollars for ten new diapers.” 

“My dear, do you realize that the 
human race lasted at least a million 



years with no diapers at all? Where- 
as we may not last another hour. 
So let’s not spend it talking about 
diapers.” 

*■1 simply meant — Wups! They’re 
moving us.” 

“Sit flat on the floor and brace 
your feet against the wall. Before 
we have scrambled babies. You were 
saying?” 

“I simply meant, my darling, that 
I do not care about diapers, I don’t 
care about anything — now that I 
have you back with me again. But 
if we aren’t going to die — if this 
thing works — I’m going to have to 
be practical. And do you know of 
anything more practical than dia- 
pers?” 

“Yes. Kissing. Making love.” 
“Well, yes. But they lead to dia- 
pers. Darling, could you hold Hughie 
in your other arm and put this one 
around me? Uh, they’re moving us 
again. Hugh, is this going to work? 
Or are we going to be very suddenly 
dead? Somehow I can imagine time 
travel frontwards — and anyhow we 
did it. But I can’t imagine it back- 
wards. I mean, the past has already 
happened. That’s it. Isn’t it?” 
“Well, yes. But you haven’t stat- 
ed it correctly. The way J see it, 
there are no paradoxes in time trav- 
el, there can’t be. If we are going 
to make this time jump, then we 
already did; that’s what happened. 
And if it doesn’t work, then it’s 
because it didn’t happen.” 

“But it hasn’t happened yet. 
Therefore, you are saying that it 
didn’t happen, so it can’t happen. 
That’s what I said.” 

“No, no! We don’t know whether

i has already happened or not. If 

ii did, it will. If it didn't, it won't.” 
“Darling, you’re confusing me.” 
“Don’t worry about it. The mov- 
ing finger writes, and having writ, 
moves on’ — and only then do you 
ind out if it goosed you in passing. 
I think we’ve straightened out on a 
fourse; we’re steady now, just the 
Saintest vibration. And if they are 
taking us where I think they are, 
lames County I mean, then we’ve 
got at least an hour before we need 
worry about anything.” He tighten- 
id his arm around ler. “So let’s be 
Sappy that hour.” 

She snuggled in. “That’s what I 
was saying. Beloved, we’ve come 
through so many narrow squeaks 
together that I’m not ever going to 
worry again. If it’s an hour. I’ll be 
Sappy every second of it. If it’s 
forty years. I’ll be happy every sec- 
ond of that, too. If it’s together. 
And if it’s not together, I don’t want 
k. But either way, we go on. To the 
fnd of our day.” 

“Yes. To the end of our day."' 

S he sighed happily, rearranged a 
wet and sleeping infant, snug- 
gled into his shoulder and murmur- 
ed, “This feels like our very first 
day. In the tank room of the shelter 
I mean. We were just as crowded 
and even warmer — and I was never 
so happy. And we didn’t know 
whether we were going to live 
through that day, either. That night.” 
“We didn’t expect to. Else we 
wouldn’t have twin boys now.” 

“So I”m glad we thought we were 
going to die. Hugh? It actually isn’t 



any more crowded than it was that 
night in the tank room.” 

“Woman, you are an insatiabl# 
lecher. You’ll shock the boys.” 

“I don’t think once in more than 
a year is being insatiable. And the 
boys are too young to be shocked. 
Aw, come on! You said yourself wo 
might be dead in an hour.” 

“Yes, we might and you have a 
point and I’m theoretically in favor 
of the idea. But the boys do in- 
hibit me and there actually isn't 
quite as much room even it we 
weren’t cluttered up with eight or 
nine wet babies and I don’t see how 
it’s mechanically possible. The act 
would be a tesseract, at least.” 
“Well — I guess you’re right. But 
it does seem a shame, if we’re going 
to die.” 

“I refuse to assume that we’re 
going to die. I won’t ever make that 
assumption again. All my figuring 
is based on the assumption that wc 
are going to live. We go on. No 
matter what happens — we go on.” 
“All right. Seven no trump.” 
“That’s better.” 

“Doubled and redoubled. Hugh? 
Just as soon as the boys are big 
enough to hold thirteen cards in 
their pudgy little hands, we’re going 
to start teaching them contract 
Then we’ll have a family four of our 
own.” 

“Suits. And if they can’t learn to 
play, we’ll temper them and try 
again.” 

“I don’t want ever to hear that 
word again!” 

“Sorry.” 

“And I don’t want to hear that 



120 



IF 




language again, either, dear. The 
boys should grow up hearing Eng- 
fish.” 

“Sorry again. You’re right. But I 
may slip; I’ve gotten in the habit of 
thinking in it — all that translating. 
So allow me a few slips.” 

“I’ll always allow you a few slips. 
Speaking of slips — Did you? With 
Kitten?” 

“No.” 

“Why not? I wouldn’t have mind- 
ed. Well, not much anyhow. She 
was sweet. She would baby-sit for 
me any time I would let her. She 
loved our boys.” 

“Barbara, I don’t want to think 
about Kitten. It makes me sad. I 
just hope whoever has her now is 
good to her. She didn’t have any de- 
fenses at all — like a kitten before 
it has its eyes open. Helpless. Kit- 
ten means to me everything that is 
utterly damnable about slavery.” 
She squeezed his hand. “I hope 
they’re good to her, too. But, dear, 
don’t hurt yourself inside about it; 
there is nothing we can do for her.” 
“I know it and that’s why I don’t 
want to talk about her. But I do 
miss her. As a daughter. She was a 
daughter to me. ‘Bedwarmer’ never 
entered into it. 

“Hey, I think we’re there.” 

The box was moved several times, 
then remained stationary a few min- 
utes, then surged straight up with 
sickening suddenness, stopped with 
another stomach twister, seemed to 
hunt a little, and then was perfect- 
ly steady. 

“You in the experimental chamb- 
er,” a voice said out of nowhere. 



**You are wai;ned to expect a short 
fall. You are advised to stand up, 
each of you hold one brat, and be 
ready to fall. Do you understand?” 
“Yes,” Hugh an:>wered while help- 
ing Barbara to her feet. “How much 
of a fall?” 

There was no answer. Hugh said, 
“Hon, I don’t know what they mean. 
A ‘short fair could be one foot, or 
fifty. Protect Joey with your arms 
and better bend your knees a little. 
If it’s quite a fall, then go ahead and 
go down; don’t try to take it stiff 
legged. These jokers don’t give a 
hoot what happens to us.” 

“Bent knees. Protect Joey. All 
right.” 

They fell. 

xxn 

H ugh never did know how far 
they fell but he decided later 
that it could not have been more 
than four feet. One instant they 
were standing in a well-lighted, 
cramped box; the next instant they 
were outdoors, in the dark of night, 
and falling. 

His boots hit, he went down, land- 
ing on the ri^t side of his rump 
and on two very hard rolls of silver 
dollars in his hip pocket — rolled 
with the fall and protected the baby 
in his arms. 

Then he rolled to a sitting po- 
sition. Barbara was near him, on 
her side. She was not moving. “Bar- 
bara! Are you hurt?” 

“No,” she said breathlessly. “I 
don’t think so. Just knocked the 
breath out of me.” 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD

“Is Joey all right? Hughie is, but 
[ think he’s more than wet now.” 
“Joey is all right.” Joey confirm- 
ed this by starting to yell; his broth- 
er joined him. “He had the breath 
knocked out him, too, I think. Shut 
up, Joey; Mother is busy. Hugh, 
where are we?” 

He looked around. “We are,” he 
announced, “in a parking lot in a 
shopping center about four blocks 
from where I live. And apparently 
somewhere close to our own proper 
time. At least that’s a ‘sixty-one 
Ford we almost landed on.” The 
parking lot was empty save for this 
one car. It occurred to him that 
their arrival might have been some- 
thing else than a bump — an ex- 
plosion, perhaps? — if they had 
been six feet to the right. But he 
dropped the thought. Enough nar- 
row squeaks and one more didn’t 
matter. 

He stood up and helped Barbara 
up. She winced and in the dim light 
that came from inside the bank he 
noticed it. “Trouble?” 

“I turned my ankle when I hit.” 
“Can you walk?” 

“I can walk.” 

“I’ll carry both kids. It’s not far.” 
“Hugh, where are we going?” 
“Why, home, of course.” He look- 
ed in the window of the bank, tried 
to spot a calendar. He saw one but 
the standing light was not shining 
on it; he couldn’t read it. “I wish I 
knew the date. Honey, I hate to ad- 
mit it but it does look as if time 
travel has some paradoxes — and 
I think we are about to give some- 
body a terrible shock.” 



“Who?” Barbara asked. 

“Me, maybe. In my earlier in- 
carnation. Maybe I ought to phone 
him first, not shock him. No, he — 
I, I mean — wouldn’t believe it. 
Sure you can walk?” 

“Certainly.” 

“All right. Hold our monstew 
for a moment and let me set my 
watch.” He glanced back into the 
bank where a clock was visible even 
though the calendar was shadowed. 
“Okay. Gimme. And holler if you 
need to stop.” 

They set off, Barbara limping but 
keeping up. He discouraged talk be- 
cause he did not have his thoughts 
in order. To see a town that he had 
thought of as destroyed so quiet and 
peaceful on a warm summery night 
shook him more than he dared ad- 
mit. He carefully avoided any 
speculation as to what he might find 
at his home — except one fleeting 
thought that if it turned out that his 
shelter was not yet built, then it 
never would be and he would try 
his hand at changing history. 

He adjourned that thought, too, 
and concentrated on being glad that 
Barbara was a woman who never 
chattered when her man wanted her 
to be quiet. 

P resently they turned into his 
driveway, Barbara still limping 
and Hugh beginning to develop 
cramps in both arms from being un- 
able to shift his double load. There 
were two cars parked tandem and 
facing out in the drive; he stopped 
at the first one, opened the door 
and said, “Slide in, sit down, and 
take the load off that ankle. I’ll 



122

leave the boys with you and recon- 
noiter.” The house was brightly 
lighted. 

“Hugh! Don’t do it!” 

“Why not?” 

“This is my car. This is the 
night r 

He stared at her for a long mo- 
ment. Then he said quietly, “Tm still 
going to reconnoiter. You sit here.” 

He was back in less than two min- 
utes, jerked open the car door, col- 
lapsed onto the seat, let out a sob. 

Barbara said, “Darling! Darling!” 

“Oh, my God!” He choked and 
caught his breath. '^Site's in there! 
Grace. And so am /.” He gasped 
again. "'All of us are there. I heard 
Karen laugh!” He dropped his face 
to the steering wheel and sobbed. 

“Hugh.” 

“What? Oh, my Godr 

“Stop it, Hugh. I started the engine 
while you were gone. The keys were 
in the ignition, I had left them there 
so that Duke could move it and get 
out. So let’s go. Can you drive?” 

He sobered down. “I can drive.” 
He took ten seconds to check the in- 
strument board, adjusted the seat 
backward, put it in gear, turned 
right out of the drive. Four minutes 
later he turned west on the highway 
into the mountains being careful 
to observe the stop sign; it had 
occurred to him that this was no 
night to get stopped and pulled off 
the road for driving without a 
license. 

As he made the turn a clock in the 
distance banged the half hour. He 
glanced at his wrist watch, noted a 
one-minute difference. “Switch on 
the radio, hon.” 



“Hugh, I’m sorry. The durn thing 
quit and I couldn’t afford to have it 
repaired.” 

“Oh. No matter. The news doesn’t 
matter, I mean; time is all that mat- 
ters. I’m trying to estimate how far 
we can go in an hour. An hour and 
some minutes. Do you recall what 
time the first missile hit us?” 

“I think you told me it was eleven- 
forty-seven.” 

“Thats my recollection, too. I’m 
certain of it, I just wanted it con- 
firmed. But it all checks. You made 
crepes Suzettes, you and Karen 
fetched them in just in time to catch 
the end of the ten o’clock news. I 
ate pretty quickly — they were won- 
derful — and this looney old char- 
acter rang the doorbell. Me, I mean. 
And I answered it. Call it ten-twenty 
or a little after. So we just heard 
half-past chime and my watch 
agrees. We’ve got about seventy- 
five minutes to get as far from 
ground zero as possible. 

Barbara made no comment. Mo- 
ments later they passed the city 
limits; Hugh put the speed up from 
a careful forty-five to an exact sixty- 
five. 

A bout ten minutes later she said» 
“Dear? I’m sorry. About Karen» 
I mean. Not about anything else.” 
“I’m not sorry about anything. 
No, not about Karen. Hearing her 
merry laugh again shook me up, yes. 
But now I treasure it. Barbara, for 
the first time in my life I have a 
conviction of immortality. Karen is 
alive right now, back there behind 
us — and yet we saw her die. So 
somehow, in some timeless sense. 



FARMHAM'S FREEHOLD 



123 




Karen is alive forever, somewhere. 
Don’t ask me to explain it, but that’s 
how it is.” 

“I’ve always known it, Hugh. But 
I didn’t dare say so.” 

“Dare say anything, damn it! I 
told you that long ago. So I no 
longer feel sorrow over Karen. I 
can’t feel any honest sorrow over 
Grace. Some people make a career 
of trying to get their own way, and 
succeeding; she’s one of them. As 
for Duke, I hate to think about him. 
I had great hopes for my son. My 
first son. But I never had control 
over his rearing and I certainly had 
no control over what became of him. 
And, as Joe pointed out to me, 
Duke’s not too badly off — if welfare 
and security and happiness are suf- 
ficient criteria.” Hugh shrugged 
without taking his hands from the 
wheel. “So I shall forget him. As of 
this instant I shall endeavor never 
to think about Duke again.” 

Presently he spoke again. “Hon, 
can you, in spite of being smothered 
in babies, get at that clock thing on 
my shoulder and get it off?” 

“I’m sure I can.’ 

“Then do it and chuck it into 
the ditch. I’d rather throw it away 
inside the circle of total destruction 
if we’re still in it.” He scowled. “I 
don’t want those people ever to have 
time travel. Especially Ponse.” 

She worked silently for some mo- 
ments, awkwardly with one hand. 
She got the radiation clock loose 
and threw it out into the darkness 
before she spoke. “Hugh, I don’t 
think Ponse intended us to accept 
that offer. I think he made the 
terms such that he knew that I would 



refuse, even if you were inclined to 
sacrifice yourself.” 

“Of course! He picked us as 
guinea pigs and chivvied us into 
‘volunteering.’ Barbara, I can stand 
— and somewhat understand but not 
forgive — a straight-out skunk. But 
Ponse was much worse, for my 
money. He had good intentions. He 
could always prove why the hotfoot 
he was giving you was for your own 
good. I despise him.” 

Barbara said stubbornly, “Hugh, 
how many white men of today could 
be trusted with the power Ponse had 
and use it with as much gentleness 
as he did use it?” 

“Huh? None. Not even yours 
truly. And that was a low blow 
about ‘white men.’ Color doesn’t 
enter into it.” 

“I withdraw the word ‘white.* 
And I’m sure that you are one who 
could be trusted with it. But I don’t 
know any others.” 

44XJot even me. Nobody can be 
trusted with it. The one 
time I had it I handled it as badly as 
Ponse. I mean that time I caused a 
gun to be raised at Duke. I should 
simply have used karate if he really 
got in my way, and knocked him 
out, not humiliated him. Nobody, 
Barbara. But Ponse was especially 
bad. Take Memtok. I’m really sorry 
that I happened to kill Memtok. He 
was a man who behaved better than 
his nature, not worse. Memtok had 
a streak of meanness, sadism, wide 
as his back. But he held it closely in 
check so that he could do his job 
better. But Ponse — Barbie hon, this 
is probably a subject on which you 



124 



IF 




and I will never agree. You feel a 
bit soft toward him because he was 
sweet to you part of the time and 
always sweet to our boys. But I de- 
spised him because of that — because 
he was always showing ‘king’s mercy* 
— ^being less cruel than he could of 
been, but always reminding his vic- 
tim of how cruel he could be if he 
were not such a sweet old guy and 
such a prince of a fellow. I despised 
him for it. I despised him long be- 
fore I found out about his having 
young girls butchered and served for 
his dinner.” 

“What?” 

“Didn’t you know? Oh, surely, 
you must have known. Ponse and I 
discussed it in our very last talk. 
Weren’t you listening?” 

“I thought that was just heavy 
sarcasm, on the part of each of you.” 
“Nope, Ponse is a cannibal. May- 
be not a cannibal, since he doesn’t 
consider us human. But he does eat 
us — they all do. Ponse always ate 
girls. About one a day for his fam- 
ily table, I gathered. Girls about the 
age and plumpness of Kitten.” 
“But — But — Hugh. / ate the same 
thing he did, lots of times. I must 
have — I must have — ” 

“Sure you did. So did I. But not 
after I knew. Nor did you,” 

“Honey . you better stop the 
car. I’m going to be sick.” 

“Throw up on the twins if you 
must. This car doesn’t stop for any- 
thing.” 

She managed to get the window 
open, got her head outside. Pres- 
ently he said gently. “Feeling bet- 
ter?” 

“Some." 



“Sweetheart, don’t hold what he 
ate too much against Ponse. He hon- 
estly did not know it was wrong — 
and no doubt cows would feel the 
same way about us, if they knew. 
But these other things he knew were 
wrong. Because he tried to justify 
them. He rationalized slavery, he 
rationalized tyranny, he rationalized 
cruelty, and always wanted the vic- 
tim to agree and thank him. The 
headsman expected to be tipped.” 
“I don’t want to talk about him, 
dear. I feel all mixed up inside.” 
“Sorry. I’m half drunk without 
a drop and babbling. I’ll shut up. 
Watch the traffic behind. I’m going 
to make a left turn shortly.” 

She did so and after they had 
turned off on a state road, narrower, 
and not as well graded, he said, “I’ve 
figured out where we’re going. At 
first I was just putting distance be- 
hind us. Now we’ve got a destina- 
tion. Maybe a safe one.” 

“Where, Hugh?” 

“A shutdown mine. I had a piece 
of it, lost some money in it. Now 
maybe it pays off. The Havely Lode. 
Nice big tunnels and we can reach 
the access road from this road. If I 
can find it in the dark. If we can 
get there before the trouble starts.” 
He concentrated on herding the car, 
changing down on the grades both 
climbing and on the occasional 
downhill piece, braking hard before 
going into a curve, then cornering 
hard with plenty of throttle in the 
curves. 

A fter a particularly vicious turn 
with Barbara on the hair-rais- 
ing outside, she said, “Look, dear. 



FARNHAM'S FREEHOLD 



12i 




I know you’re doing it to save us. 
But we can be just as dead from a 
car crash as from an H-bomb.” 
He grinned without slowing. “I 
used to drive jeeps in the dark with 
no headlights. Barbie, I won’t kill 
us. Few people realize how much a 
car will do and I’m delighted that 
this has a manual gear shift. You 
need it in the mountains. I would 
not dare this way with an automatic 
shift.” 

She shut up and prayed, silently. 
The road dropped into a high alp 
where it met another road; at the 
intersection there was a light. When 
he saw it Hugh said, “Read my 
watch.” 

“Eleven twenty-five.” 

“Good. We are slightly over fifty 
miles from ground zero. From my 
house, I mean. And the Havely 
Lode is only five minutes beyond 
here, I know how to find it now. I 
see Schmidt’s Corner is open and 
we are low on gas. We’ll grab some 
and groceries, too — yes, I recall you 
told me you had both in this car; 
we’ll get more — and still make it 
before the curtain.” 

He braked and scattered gravel, 
stopped by a pump, jumped out. 
“Run inside and start grabbing 
stuff. Put the twins on the floor 
of the car and close the door. Won’t 
hurt ’em.” He stuck the hose into 
the car’s tank, started cranking. 

She was out in a moment. 
“There’s nobody here.” 

“Honk the horn. The Dutchman 
is probably back at his house.” 
Barbara honked and honked and 
the babies cried. Hugh hung up the 
hose. “Fourteen gallons we owe him 




for. Let’s go in. Should roll in just 
ten minutes, to be safe.” 

Schmidt’s Corner was a gasoline 
station, a small lunch counter and 
a one-story grocery store, all of the 
sort that cater to local people, fisher- 
men, hunters and the tourist who 
likes to get off the pavement. Hugh 
wasted no time trying to rouse out 
the owner. The place told its own 
story: All lights were on, the screen 
door stood open, coffee was simmer- 
ing on a hot plate, a chair had been 
knocked over, and the radio was 
tuned to Conelrad. It suddenly 
spoke up as he came in: 

**Bomb warning. Third bomb 
warning. This is not a drill. Take 
shelter at once. Any shelter , God 
damn it, you're going to be atom- 
bombed in the next few minutes. Vm 
damn well going to leave this god- 
damn microphone and dive for the 
basement myself when impact is five 
minutes away! So get the lead out, 
you stupid fools, and quit listening 
to this chatter! TAKE SHELTERr 
“Grab those empty cartons and 
start filling them. Don’t pack, just 
dump stuff in. I’ll trot them out. 
We’ll fill the back seat and floor.” 
Hugh started following his own or- 
ders, had one carton filled before 
Barbara did. He rushed it out, rushed 
back! Barbafa had another waiting, 
and a third almost filled. “Hugh. 
Stop one second. Look.’ 

The end carton was not exactly 
empty. Mama cat, quite used to 
strangers, stared solemnly out at 
him while four assorted fuzzy ones 
nursed. Hugh returned her stare. 

He suddenly closed the top of the 
carton over her. “All right,” he said. 



“Load something light into another 
carton so it weighs this one down 
while I drive. Hurry.” He rushed 
out to the car with the little family 
while the mother cat set up an agon- 
ized complaint. 

Barbara followed quickly with a 
half-loaded carton, put it on top of 
the cat box. They both rushed back 
inside. “Take all the canned milk 
he’s got.” Hugh stopped long enough 
to put a roll of dollars on top of the 
cash register. “And grab all the toilet 
paper or Kleenex you see, too. 
Three minutes till we leave.” 

T hey left in five minutes but with 
more cartons; the back seat of 
the car was well leveled off. “I got 
a dozen tea towels,” Barbara said 
gleefully, “and six big packs of 
Chux.” 

“Huh?” 

“Diapers, dear, diapers. Might last 
us past the fallout. I hope. And I 
grabbed two packs of playing cards, 
too. Maybe I shouldn’t have.” 
“Don’t be hypocritical, my love. 
Hang onto the kids and be sure that 
door is locked. Now it gets rough.” 
He drove for several hundred yards, 
with his head hanging out. “Herel” 
The going got very rough. Hugh 
drove in low gear and very care- 
fully. 

A black hole in the side of the 
mountain loomed up suddenly as 
he turned. “Good, we’ve made it! 
And we drive straight inside.” He 
started in and tromped on the brake. 
“Good Lord! A cow.” 

“And a calf,” Barbara added, 
leaning out her side. 

“I’ll have to back out.” 



FARNHAM^S FREEHOLD 



127 




“Hugh. A cow. With a calf.” 

“Uh . how the hell would we 
feed her?” 

“Hugh, it may not burn here at 
all. And that’s a real live cow.” 

“Uh ... all right, all right. We’ll 
eat them if we have to.” There was 
a wooden wall and a stout door 
about thirty feet inside the mouth 
of the mine tunnel. Hugh eased the 
car forward, forcing the reluctant 
cow ahead of him, and at last 
crunched his side of the car against 
the rock wall to allow the other 
door to open. 

The cow immediately made a 
break for freedom; Barbara opened 
her door and thereby stopped her. 
The calf bawled, the twins echoed 
him. 

Hugh squeezed out past Barbara 
and the babies, got past the cow and 
unfastened the door, which was se- 
cured by a padlock passed through 
a hasp but not closed. He shoved 
the cow’s rump aside and braced the 
door open. “Kick on the ‘up’ lights. 
Let it shine in.” 

Barbara did, then insisted that 
cow and calf be brought inside. 
Hugh muttered something about, 
“Noah’s bloody ark!” but agreed, 
largely because the cow was so very 
much in the way. The door, though 
wide, was about one inch narrower 
than bossie; she did not want to go 
through it. But Hugh got her headed 
that way, then kicked her emphat- 
ically. She went through. The calf 
followed his mother. 

At which point Hugh discovered 
why the cow was in the tunnel. 
Someone — presumably someone 
nearby — bad converted mine in- 



to use as a cow barn; there were a 
dozen or so bales of hay inside. The 
cow showed no wish to leave once 
she was at this treasure. 

Cartons were carried in, two car- 
tons were dumped and a twin placed 
in each, with a carton of cat and 
kittens just beyond and all three 
weighed down to insure temporary 
captivity. 

While they were unloading Bar- 
bara’s survival gear from the trunk, 
everything became noonday bright. 

Barbara said, “Oh, heavens! We 
aren’t through/' 

“We go on unloading. Maybe ten 
minutes till the sound wave. I don’t 
know about the shock wave. Here, 
take the rifle.” 

They had the car empty with jeep 
cans of water and gasoline out but 
not yet inside when the ground be- 
gan to tremble and noise of giant 
subways started. Hugh put the cans 
inside, yelled, “Move these!” 

“Hugh! Come in!” 

“Soon.” There was loose hay he 
had driven over just back of the 
car. He gathered it up, stuffed it 
through the door, went back and 
scavenged, not to save the hay but 
to reduce fire hazard to gasoline in 
the cars tank. He considered backing 
the car out and letting it plunge 
down the hill. He decided not to 
risk it. If it got hot enough to set 
fire to the car’s gas tank — well, 
there were side tunnels, deep inside. 
“Barbara! Do you have a light yet?” 

“Yes! Please come inside. Please!" 

He went in, barred the door. 
“Now we move these bales of hay, 
far back. You carry the light, I 
carry the hay. And mind your feet.

It is wet a bit farther back. That’s 
why we shut down.” 

T ey moved groceries, livestock 
(human, bovine, and feline) 
and gear into a side tunnel a hun- 
dred yards inside the mountain. 
They had to wade through several 
inches of water on the way but the 
side tunnel was slightly higher and 
dry. Once Barbara lost a moccasin. 
“Sorry,” said Hugh. “This mountain 
is a sponge. Almost every bore 
struck water.” 

“I,” said Barbara, “am a woman 
who appreciates water. 

Hugh did not answer as the flash 



“What did you mean?” 

“Hugh, I didn’t tell you at the 
time. I was too upset by it and 
didn’t want you to get upset. But I 
don’t own a manual gear shift car.” 
“Huh? Then whose car is that?” 
“Mine. I mean my keys were in 
it — and it certainly had my stuff in 
the trunk. But mine’s automatic.” 
“Honey,” he said slowly, “I think 
you’ve flipped your lid a little.” 

“I thought you would . think so 
and that’s why I didn’t say anything 
until we were safe. But Hugh — 
listen to me, dear! — I have never 
owned a manual shift car. I didn’t 
learn to drive that far back. I don’t

ened everything even that deep in- 
side — just through the cracks of a 
wooden wall. He looked at his watch. 
“Right on time, I think. We’re sitting 
through a second show of the same 
movie, Barb.» But this time I hope 
it will be cooler.” 

“I wonder.” 

“If it will be cooler? Sure it will. 
Even if it burns outside. I think I

and save us, and maybe the cats but 
not the cow and calf, even if smoke

“Hugh, I didn’t mean that.”

He stared thoughtfully. “I don’t 
understand it.” 

“Neither do I. Darling, when you 
came away from your house, you 
said, *She*s in there. Grace.’ Did you 
mean you saw her?” 

“Why, yes. She was nodding over 
the television, half passed out.” 
“But, dearest, Grace had been 
nodding over the television. But you 
put her to bed while I was making 
crepes Suzettes. Don’t you remem-

and got her and carried her down — 
in her nightgown.”

H ugh Farnham stood quite still 
for several moments. “So 1 
did,” he agreed. “So I had. Well, 
let’s get the rest of this gear moved. 
The big one will be along in about 
an hour and a half.” 

“But will it be?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Hugh, I don’t know what has 
happened. Maybe this is a different 
worid. Or maybe it’s the same one 
but just a tiny bit changed by — 
well, by us coming back, perhaps.” 
The big one came on time. It 
shook them up, did not hurt them. 
When the air wave hit, it blew in 
the wall and shook them up again. 

Hugh noted the time, then said 
thoughtfully. ‘Tf it is a different 
world, it is not very. Yet — ” 

“Yet what, dear?” 

“Well, it is some different. You 
wouldn’t forget that about your own 
car. And I do remember putting 
Grace to bed early; Duke and I had 
a talk afterwards. So, it’s different.” 
Suddenly he grinned. “It could be 
importantly different. If the future 
can change the past, or whatever, 
maybe the past can change the fu- 
ture, too. Maybe the United States 
won’t be wholly destroyed. Maybe 
neither side will be so suicidal as to 
use plague bombs. Maybe — ^Hell, 
maybe Ponse will never get a chance 
to have teen-age girls for dinner!” 
He added, “I’m damn’ well going to 
make a try to see that he doesn’t 1”

Forgotten road to success in writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

I can’t imagine why more beginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I’ve enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at horne, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising of Business Writing.) 

You learn to write by writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 60 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 



Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so. 




“Jack” Ratcliff is one of America’s highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including over 
100 in Reader's Digest alone.
