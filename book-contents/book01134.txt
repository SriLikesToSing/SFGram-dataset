THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some— but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
fects remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

SF IN THE SUN 



A lmost threaded on the Tropic 
of Capricorn, most cosmo- 
politan of the world’s cities in 
the Tropic Zone, Rio de Janeiro 
is a city of high-rise apartments 
and high-flying ambitions. In 
March of this year it spread its 
hospitality to an International 
Film Festival — not sf films in 
particular, just movies in gener- 
al — and as an extra added at- 
traction it threw in one of his- 
tory’s most lavish science-fiction 
conferences. Robert Heinlein 
came in from his new California 
home, Damon Knight from Flor- 
ida, John Brunner from London. 
Fritz Lang was there, a lot older 
than when he was producing 
such early sf film classics as 
Metropolis and The Girl in the 
Moon, and nearly blind, but still 
vital, alert and ready to plan for 
the future. Every morning for a 
solid week there was a science- 
fiction symposium. Brian Aldiss 
told the audience that there was 
no such thing as science fiction, 
really, it being only a sort of la- 
bel astute publishers invented for 
a product; Alfred Bester describ- 
ed the writing process; A. E. Van 
Vogt explained the reasoning be- 
hind his inventive plots. Robert 
Bloch and Robert Sheckley, Foul 



Anderson and James Ballard, 
Harry Harrison and Forrest J. 
Ackerman — they were all there 
and participating, with many 
more, your editor included. 

It was quite an occasion. In the 
afternoons there was the beach of 
Copacabana, just across the road. 
In the evenings were cocktail 
parties, receptions, midnight sup- 
pers at embassies. And in, at and 
between all the events was the 
endless serial debate that goes on 
wherever sf writers meet. 

W hat do sf writers talk about 
at these events? Why, most- 
ly they talk about sf, how to do 
it, why its worth doing, ways of 
making it better. The New Wave 
and the Old Reliables meet, and 
spar for a while, and compare 
notes and discover that they are, 
after all, not that far apart . 
a discovery which sometimes sur- 
prises some of them very much. 

We all owe Cariocas thanks. 
Not just for hospitality, which 
was extreme, but even more for 
the chance for sf writers from half 
the world to sit down and think 
for a week about the things that 
unite them, rather than the things 
that keep them apart.

DUNE 

MESSIAH 

by FRANK HERBERT 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 

Tfjey had forced godhead on Muad'dib. 

Now they fought to destroy him. And 
in all the plethora of futures he saw 
no place for Paul Atreides, the man! 



PRECEDE 



The leaders of tiRe Qizarate, 
whose church was founded in Mu- 
ad’dib’s name, saw their Jihad 
ending. In just twelve standard 
years, the religious war of the 



Jihad had created an enormous 
wave of passive hate and active 
opposition. There was the obvious 
fact, as well, that religious co- 
lonialism, having annesed planet

THE WEIRD OF DEXE 



Dune was on arid planet of great deserts where life seemed al- 
most impossible. The semi-nomadic Fremen based all their customs 
on wafer scarcity and faced the deserts in stillsuits which recovered all 
moisture. Gigantic sand worms and savage storms were a constant men- 
ace to them. Dune's only resource was the melange, an addictive 
drug produced by the worms. This "spice" aided longevity and gave an 
adept some ability to foresee the future. 

PAUL ATREIDES was the son of Dune's ruler. When his father was 
killed in a war with the Harkonnen rival nobility, Paul fled into the 
desert, together with his friend and teacher, DUNCAN IDAHO, and 
his pregnant mother, the LADY JESSICA. She was also an adept, trained 
by the Bene Gesserit — a female order devoted to mental arts and 
the control of genetic lines. According to them, Paul was of a line that 
was to give them a "kwisatz haderach," a sort of messioh for the 
future. 

Paul grew and earned acceptance by the Fremen and even learned 
to control and ride the sand worms. In one of their rituals, he was 
forced to take a massive overdose of spice; this produced a permanent 
change in him, so that he could goin visions of the future — or fu- 
tures. His mother also took an overdose, trying to control it by Bene 
Gesserit methods. As a result Paul's sister, ALIA, was made aware of 
all her mother's knowledge while still in the womb and was 
fully cognitive at birth. 

^Paiil fought his way to the leadership of the Fremen. He mated 
with a Fremen girl, CHANI, and adopted most of their customs. But 
his Atreides mind had been trained to disciplines unknown to them, 
and he gave them an organization and mission they had not known 
before. He also planned to change the climate of Dune and bring wa- 
ter to the planet. 

Before his plans were fully developed, his hereditary enemy, the 
Harkonnen rulers, struck at Dune. With only the Fremen to oppose them, 
Paul struck back. In spite of their supposedly invincible Sordaukar 
soldiers, Paul's forces overcame them in a great battle. During this war, 
Duncan Idaho wos killed. 

In the treaty Paul imposed, he gained a power base that would 
enable them to begin carving out a star empire, with Dune as its base. 
He also took the Harkonnen heir, PRINCESS IRULAN, os his consort, 
though he refused to consummate the marriage, remaining true to Choni. 

In the ensuing twelve years, he has created his empire. But now all 
the ancient power groups are beginning to unite and conspire against 
Muad'dib, as he is called, and against the future his visions hove 
shown him.

after planet in that short span of 
years, was running out of new 
real estate to subdue. 

Into this downward spiral came 
the ancient quasi-religious sister- 
hood of the Bene Gesserit, the 
Spacing Guild with its virtual mo- 
nopoly on interstellar transport, 
and the scientific amoralists of 
the Bene Tleilax, all united in a 
plot to overthrow the Emperor 
Paul-Muad’dib, ne-Atreides. 

The Qizarate cabal, led by Kor- 
ba the Panygerist, fastened upon 
this plot as an ideal opportunity 
to stir up the sort of chaos from 
which they might gain new im- 
petus. This was eminently practi- 
cal a move of Judgment Strate- 
gy which might have originated 
in the old training manual writ- 
ten by Paul-Muad’dib’s father, 
the Duke Leto. It called first for 
the creation of a martyr, Muad- 
’dib himself. Next, it sought a 
universal object of hate, choosing 
Muad’dib’s concubine, the Lady 
Chani. The plan was to saddle her 
with blame for Muad’dib’s death. 

Taken as a whole, this was a 
much better plan than that of 
the Guild-Tleilaxu-Bene Gesserit 
plotters and their allies among 
the Great Families of the Lands- 
raad. This analysis, therefore, will 
examine in some detail where the 
Qizarate’s plan succeeded and 
where it fell short.

There exists no separation be- 
tween gods and men; one blends 
softly casual into the other, 

—Proverbs of Muad’chb 

D espite die murderous nature 
of the plot he hoped to de- 
vise, the thoughts of Scjrtale, the 
Tleilaxu face dancer, returned 
again and again to rueful compas- 
sion. 

I shall regret causing death and 
misery to Muad" dib, he told him- 
self. 

He kept this benignity carefully 
hidden from his fellow conspira- 
tors. Such feelings told him, 
though, that he found it easier to 
identify with the victim than 
with the attackers — a thing 
characteristic of the Tleilaxu. 

Sc5rtale stood in bemused si- 
lence somewhat apart from the 
others. The argument about psy- 
chic poison had been going on for 
some time now. It was energetic 
and vehement, but polite in that 
blindly compulsive way adepts of 
the Great Schools always adopt- 
ed for matters close to their dog- 
ma. 

“When you think you have him 
skewered, right then you’ll find 
him unwounded!” 

That was the old Reverend 
Mother of the Bene Gesserit. Ga- 
ins Helen Mohiam, their hostess

here on WallacG IX. She was a 
black robed stick figure, a witch 
crone seated in a floater chair at 
Scytale’s left. Her aba hood Had 
been thrown back to expose a 
leathery face beneath silver Kair. 
Deeply pocketed eyes stared out 
of skull-mask features. 

They were using a mirabhasa 
language, honed phalange conso- 
nants and jointed vowels. It was 
an instrument for conveying fine 
emotional subtleties. Ekiric, the 
Guild Steersman, replied to the 
Reverend Mother now with a vo- 
cal curtsy contained in a sneer — 
a lovely touch of disdainful po- 
liteness. 

Scytale looked at the Guild 
envoy. Edric swam in a container 
of orange gas only a few paces 
away. His container sat in the 
center of the transparent dome 
which the Bene Gesserit had built 
for this meeting. The Guildsman 
was an elongated figxure, vaguely 
humanoid with finned feet and 
hugely fanned membranous hands 
— a fish in a strange sea. His 
tank’s vents emitted a pale or- 
ange cloud rich with the smell of 
the geriatric spice, melange. 

“If we go on this way, we’ll 
die of stupidity!” 

That was the fourth person 
present — the potential member 
of the conspiracy — Princess Iru- 
lan, wife (but not mate, Scytale 
reminded himself) of their mu- 
tual foe. She stood at a corner

No June Galaxy, a!ack. But the 
month was not completely dry. We 
published one of the most enchant- 
ing of our adult fantasies — Lord 
Dunsany's THE KING OF ELF- 
LAND'S DAUGHTER. What an as- 
tonishingly powerful writer. We'll 
be doing a group of his shorts 
later; likewise Lovecraft, whose 
fantasy writing has been taken up 
by the psychedelic in-group, which 
is okay with us, too. The more the 
merrier. 

Also in June we had the great 
pleasure of publishing our first by 
Dave Van Arnam — STARMIND 
— a smasher, really great. And for 
the Flipper fans, the third in that 
remarkable aquatic series, DES- 
TINY AND THE DOLPHINS, by Roy 
Meyers.

June also saw the reissue of some of our 
nuggets from the past. One of Fritz 
Leiber's many Hugo Award winners, THE 
WANDERER, a richly satisfying book, and 
a much earlier, very funny jape on the 
publishing industry, writers, and creativity 
in general, titled THE SILVER EGGHEADS 
(the older ones among you may remember 
the original cover by Dick Powers which 
depicted a bare-breasted robot carrying 
a certain famous publisher in her arms.) 
Then we have Ray Bradbury's FAHREN- 
HEIT, and also OCTOBER COUNTRY, and

Jotin. Wyndham's RE-BIRTH and OUT OF 
THE DEEPS. 

July sees the Introduction of two com* 
pletaly new writers for our list — and 
for the U.S. — Richard Cowper and 
Vincent King. You may be familiar 
with their work if you follow British 
magazines, but these are first novels on 
this side of the water — namely, Cowper's 
BREAKTHROUGH, a strange, almost occult 
tale of telepathic occupation. In the old 
days it was called possession, but this 
story is very much of our time and tensely 
exciting. All the more so since one gets to 
like the "other" people as well as one 
likes the "now" people. 

Vincent King's LIGHT A LAST 
CANDLE is an incredibly jam-pack- 
ed novel. Jam-packed with ideas, 
physical adventures, inventiveness, 
characters, you name it. We first 
began to realize just how much 
there was in it when we attempted 
a short precis to let others in the 
office know what we had. A precis 
pleases nobody. The only thing to 
do is read the book. 

In July also, (my, this is a rich haul) wa 
have five by Frederik Pohl and CM. 
Kornbluth and one by Fred. The classic 
SPACE MERCHANTS, backed up by 
GLADIATOR-AT-UW, SEARCH THE SKY, 
WOLFBANE, THE WONDER EFFECT and 
ALTERNATING CURRENTS. 

And finally, as Lin Carter so aptly 
puts it, "the clean, morning world 
of William Morris." THE WOOD 
BEYOND THE WORLD. Give your- 
self to it. And a happy summer to 
all. BB

of Edric’s tank, a tall blonde 
beauty, splendid in a robe of 
blue whale fur and matching hat. 
Gold buttons glittered at her ears. 
She carried herself with an aris- 
tocrat’s hauteur, but something 
in the absorbed smoothness of her 
features betrayed the controls 
of her Bene-Gesserit backgrotmd. 

Qcjrtale’s mind turned from nu- 
ances of language and faces 
to nuances of location. All around 
the dome lay hills mangy witH 
melting snow which reflected mot- 
tled wet blueness from the small 
blue-white sun hanging at the 
meridian. 

Why this particular place? Scy- 
tale wondered. The Bene Gesser- 
it seldom did ansrthing casually. 
Take the dome’s open plan: a 
more conventional and confining 
space might have inflicted the 
Guildsman with claustrophobic 
nervousness. Inhibitions in his 
psyche were those of birth and life 
off-planet in open space. 

To have built this place es- 
pecially for Edric, though — what 
a sharp finger that pointed at his 
weakness. What here, Scytale 
wondered, was aimed at me? 

“Have you nothing to say for 
yourself, Scsrtale?’’ the Reverend 
Mother demanded. 

“You wish to draw me into this 
fool’s fight?’’ Scytale asked. 
“Very well. We’re dealing with a 
potential messiah. You don’t 

GALAXY 



latinch a frontal attack upon such 
a one. Martyrdom would defeat 
us." 

They all stared at him. 

“You think that’s the only dan- 
ger?” the Reverend Mother de- 
manded, voice wheezing. 

Sc5d:ale shrugged. He had chos- 
en a bland, round-faced appear- 
ance for this meeting, jolly fea- 
tures and vapid full lips, the body 
of a bloated dumpling. It occur- 
red to him now, as he studied his 
fellow conspirators, that he had 
made an ideal choice — out of 
instinct, perhaps. He alone in this 
group could manipulate fleshly 
appearance across a wide spec- 
trum of bodily shapes and fea- 
tures. He was the human chame- 
leon, a face dancer, and the shape 
he wore now invited others to 
judge him too lightly. 

“Well?” the Reverend Mother 
pressed. 

“I was enjoying the sUence,” 
' Scytale said. “Our hostilities are 
better left unvoiced.” 

The Reverend Mother drew 
back, and Scytale saw her reas- 
sessing him. They were aU prod- 
ucts of profound prana-bindu 
training, capable of muscle and 
nerve control that few humans 
ever achieved. But ScjFtale, a face 
dancer, had muscles and nerve 
linkages the others didn’t even 
possess plus a special quality of 
sympatico, a mimic’s insight with 
which he could put on the psyche 
DUNE MESSIAH 



of another as well as the other’s 
appearance. 

Scytale gave Her enough lame 
to complete the reassessment, then 
said: “Poison I” He uttered the 
word with the atonals which he 
said he alone understood its se- 
cret meaning. 

The Guildsman stirred and his 
voice rolled from the glittering 
speaker globe which orbited a 
comer of his tank above Irukoi. 
“We’re discussing psychic poison, 
not a physical one.” 

Scytale laughed. Mirabhasa 
laughter could flay an opponent 
and he held nothing back now. 

Irulan smiled in appreciation, 
but the comers of the Reverend 
Mother’s eyes revealed a faint 
hint of anger. 

“Stop that!” Mohiam rasped. 

Scytale stopped, but he had 
their attention now; Edric was in 
a silent rage, the Reverend Motli- 
er alert in her anger, Irulan amus- 
ed but puzzled. 

“Our friend Edric suggests,” 
Scytale said, “that a pair of Bene 
Gesserit witches trained in all 
their subtle ways have not learn- 
ed the tme uses of deception.” 

TV/Tohiam turned to stare out at 
the cold hills of her Bene 
Gesserit homeworld. She was be- 
ginning to see the vital thing 
here, Scytale realized. That was 
good. Irulan, though, was another 
matter, 

n 



“Are you one of us or not, 
Scytale?” Edric asked. He stared 
out of tiny rodent eyes. 

“My allegiance is not tfie is- 
sue,” Scytale said. He kept his 
attention on Iralan. “You are 
wondering. Princess, if this was 
why you came all those parsecs, 
risked so much?” 

She nodded agreement. 

“Was it to bandy platitudes 
with a humanoid fish or dispute 
with a fat Tleilaxu face dancer?” 
Scytale asked. 

She stepped away from Edric’s 
tank, shaking her head in an- 
noyance at the thick odor of 
melange. 

Edric took tifiis moment to 
pop a melange pill into his mouth. 
He ate the spice and breathed it 
and no doubt, drank it, Scytale 
noted. Understandable, because 
the spice heightened a steersman’s 
prescience, gave him the power 
to guide a Guild heighliner across 
space at translight speeds. With 
spice awareness he found that line 
of the ship’s future which avoided 
peril. Eldric smelled another kind 
of peril now, but his crutch of 
prescience might not find it, 

“I think it was a mistake for 
me to come here,” Irulan said. 

The Reverend Mother turned, 
opened Her eyes and closed them, 
a curiously reptillian gesture. 

Scytale shifted his gaze from 
Irulan to the tank, inviting the 
Princess to share his viewpoint. 
12 



She would, Scytale knew, see Ed- 
ric as a repellant figure: the bold 
stare, those monstrous feet and 
hands moving softly in the gas, 
the smoky swirling of orange ed- 
dies around him. She would won- 
der about his sex habits, think- 
ing how odd it would be to mate 
with such a one. Even the field 
force generator which recreated 
for Edric the weightlessness of 
space would set him apart from 
her now. 

“Princess,” Scytale said, “be- 
cause of Edric here, your hus- 
band’s oracular sight cannot 
stumble upon certain incidents, 
including this one . presum- 
ably.” 

“Presumably,” Irulan said. 

Eyes closed, the Reverend 
Mother nodded. “The phenome- 
non of prescience is poorly un- 
derstood even by its initiates,” 
she said. 

“I am a full Guild navigator 
and have the Power,” Edric said. 

Again, the Reverend Mother 
opened her eyes. This time, she 
stared at the face dancer, eyes 
probing with that peculiar Bene 
Gesserit intensity. She was weigh- 
ing minutiae. 

“No, Reverend Mother,” Scy- 
tale murmured, “I am not as sim- 
ple ai I appeared.” 

“We don’t understand this Pow- 
er of second sight,” Irulan said. 
“There’s a point. Edric says my 
husband cannot see, know or 

GALAXY 



j 



predict what happens within the 
pphere of a navigator’s influence. 
But how far does that influence 
extaid?” 

“There are people and things 
in our universe which I know 
only by their effects,” Edric said, 
his fish mouth held in a thin 
line. “I know they have been 
here . there . somewhere. 
As water creatures stir up the 
currents in their passage, so the 
prescient stir up Time. I have 
seen where your husband has 
been; never have I seen him nor 
the people who truly share his 
aims and loyalties. This is the 
concealment which an adept 
gives to those who are his.” 

“Irulan is not yours,” Scytale 
said. And he looked sidelong at 
the Princess. 

“We all know why the conspir- 
acy must be conducted only in 
my presence,” Edric said. 

U sing tfie voice mode for de- 
scribing a machine, Irulan 
said: “You have your uses, ap- 
parently.” 

She sees him now tor what fie 
is, Scytale thought. Good/ 

“The future is a thing to be 
shaped,” Scytale said. “Hold that 
thought. Princess.” 

Irulan glanced at tfie face danc- 
er. 

“People who sHare Paul’s aims 
and loyalties,” she said. “Certain 
of his Fremen legio.naires, then, 
DUNE MESSIAH 



wear his cloak. I have seen fiim 
prophesy for them, heard their 
cries of adulation for their Mah- 
di, their Muad’dib.” 

It has occurred to her, Scy- 
tale thought, that she is on trial 
here, that a judgment remains to 
be made which could preserve her 
or destroy her. She sees the trap 
we set {or her. 

Momentarily, Scytale’s gaze 
locked with that of the Reverend 
Mother, and he experienced tfie 
odd realization that they had 
shared this thought about Irulan. 
The Bene Gesserit, of course, bad 
briefed their Princess, primed her 
with the lie adroit. But the mo- 
ment always came when a Bene 
Gesserit must trust her own try- 
ing and instincts. 

“Princess, I know what it is 
you most desire from the Em- 
peror,” Edric said. 

“Who does not know it?” Iru- 
lan asked. 

“You wisfi to be the founcSog 
mother of the royal dynasty,” Bd- 
ric said, as though he had not 
heard her. “Unless you join us, 
that will never happen. Take my 
oracular word on it. The Emper- 
or married you for political rea- 
sons, but you’ll never share his 
bed.” 

“So- the oracle is also a voy- 
eur,” Irulan sneered. 

“The Emperor is more firmly 
wedded to his Fremen concubine 
than he is to youl” Edric snapped. 

13 



“And she gives him no heir,” 
Irulan said. 

“Reason is the first victim of 
strong emotiofi,” Scytale mur- 
mured. He sensed the outpouring 
of Irulan’s anger, saw his admo- 
nition take effect. 

“She gives Kim no Heir,” Iru- 
lan said, Her voice measuring out 
controlled calnaness, “because I 
am secretly administering a con- 
traceptive. Is that the sort of ad- 
mission you wanted to Hear from 
me?” 

“It would not be a thing for tKe 
Emperor to discover,” Edric said, 
smiling. 

“I have lies ready for Him,” 
Irulan said. “He may Have trutK- 
sense, but some lies are easier to 
believe tKan tKe truth.” 

“You must make tKe choice. 
Princess,” Scytale said, “but un- 
derstand what it is that protects 
you.” 

“Paul is fair with me,” sKe said. 
“I sit in his Council.” 

“In tKe twelve years you’ve been 
His Princess Consort,” Edric asked, 
“has Ke shown you the slightest 
warmtK?” 

Irulan shook Her Head. 

“He deposed your father with 
his infamous Fremen Horde, mar- 
ried you to fix his claiim to the 
throne, yet he has never crowned 
you Empress,” Edric said. 

“Edric tries to sway you with 
emotion. Princess,” Scytale said. 
“Is that not interesting?”

S he glanced at the face dancer, 
saw the bold smile on his 
features, answered it with raised 
eyebrows. She was fully aware 
now, Scytale saw, that if she left 
this conference under Edric’s 
sway, part of their plot, these 
moments might be concealed from 
Paul’s oracular vision. If she 
withheld commitment, though . 

“Does it seem to you. Princess,” 
Scytale asked, “that Edric holds 
undue sway in our conspiracy?” 
“I’ve already agreed,” Edric 
said, “that I’ll defer to the best 
judgment offered in our coun- 
cils.” 

“And who chooses the best 
judgment?” Scytale asked. 

“Do you wish the Princess to 
leave Here without joining us?” 
“He wishes her commitment to 
be a real one,” the Reverend 
Mother growled. “There should 
be no trickery between us.” 
Irulan, Scytale saw, had relax- 
ed into a thinking posture, hands 
concealed in the sleeves of her 
robe. SKe would be thinking now 
of the bait Edric had offered: to 
found a royal dynasty! She would 
be wondering what scheme the 
conspirators had provided to pro- 
tect themselves from her. She 
would be weighing many things. 

“Scytale,” Irulan said present- 
ly, “it is said that you Tleilaxu 
have an odd system of honor: 
your victims must always have 
a means of escape.” 



GALAXY 





“If tfiey can but find it,” Scy- 
tale agreed. 

“Am I a victim?” Irulani asked. 

A burst of laughter escaped 
Scytale. 

The Reverend Mother snorted. 

“Princess,” Edric said, his voice 
softly persuasive, “you already 
are one of us, have no fear of 
that. Do not spy upon the Imperi- 
al Household for your Bene Ges- 
serit superiors?” 

“Paul knows I report to my 
teachers,” she said. 

“But don’t you give them the 
material for strong propaganda 
against your Emperor?” Eidric 
asked. 

Not ‘ouf Emperor, Scsrtale 
noted. Your Emperor. Irulan is 
too much the Bene Gesserit to 
miss that slip. 

“The question is one of powers 
and how they may be used,” 
Scjrtale said, moving closer to the 
Guildman’s tank. “We of the 
Tleilaxu believe that in all the 
universe there is only the insati- 
able appetite of matter, that en- 
ergy is the only true solid. And 
energy learns. Hear me well. Prin- 
cess: energy learns. This, we call 
power.” 

“You haven’t convinced me we 
can defeat the Emperor,” Irulan 
said. 

“We haven’t even convinced 
ourselves,” Scytale said. 

“Everywhere we turn,” Irulan 
said, “his power confronts us. He’s 

16 



the kwisatz haderach, the one who 
can be many places at once. He’s 
the Mahdi whose merest whim is 
absolute command to his Qizarate 
missionaries. He’s the mental 
whose occupational mind surpass- 
es the greatest ancient computers. 
He is Muad’dib whose orders to 
the Fremen Legions depopulate 
planets. He possesses oracular 
vision which sees into the future. 
He had that gene pattern which we 
Bene Gesserits covet for ... ” 

“We know his attributes,” the 
Reverend Mother interrupted. 
“And we know the abomination, 
his sister Alia, possesses this gene 
pattern. But they’re also humans, 
both of them. Thus they have 
weaknesses.” 

“And where are those human 
weaknesses?” the face dancer ask- 
ed. “Shall we search for them in 
the religious arm of his Jihad? 
Can the Emperor’s Qizara be 
turned against him? What about 
the civil authority of the Great 
Houses? Can the Landsraad Con- 
gress do more than raise a verbal 
clamor?” 

I suggest the Combine Honnete 
Ober Advancer Mercantiles,” Ed- 
ric said, turning in his tank. 
“CHOAM is business and busi- 
ness follows profits.” 

“Or perhaps the Emperor’s 
mother,” Scytale said. “The Lady 
Jessica, I understand remains on 
Caladon, but is in frequent com- 
munication with her son.” 



GALAXY 



“That traitorous witch,” Mo- 
hian said, voice level. “Would I 
might disown my own hands 
which trained her.” 

“Our conspiracy requires a lev- 
er,” Scytale said. 

“We are more than conspira- 
tors,” the Reverend Mother coun- 
tered. 

“Ah, yes,” Scytale agreed. “We 
are energetic and we learn quick- 
ly. This makes us the one true 
hope, the certain salvation of hu- 
mankind.” He spoke in the speech 
mode for absolute conviction, 
which was perhaps the ultimate 
sneer coming, as it did, from a 
Tleilaxu, 

•V 

/^nly the Reverend Mother ap- 
peared to xmderstand the 
subtlety. “Why?” she asked, di- 
recting the question at Scytale. 

Before the face dancer could 
answer, Edric cleared his throat 
and said : “Let us not bandy phil- 
osophical nonsense. Every ques- 
tion can be boiled down to the 
one: “Why is there anything?’. Ev- 
ery religious, business and govern- 
mental question has the single de- 
rivative: ‘Who will exercise the 
power?’ Alliances, combines, com- 
plexes, they all chase mirages un- 
less they go for the power. All 
else is nonsense, as most thinking 
beings come to realize.” 

Scytale shrugged, a gesture de- 
signed solely for the Reverend 
Mother. Edric had answered her 
DUNE MESSIAH 



question for him. The ix)ntifi- 
cating fool was their major weak- 
ness. To make sure the Reverend 
Mother understood, Scytale said: 
“Listening carefully to the teach- 
er, one acquires an education.” 
The Reverend Mother nodded 
slowly. 

“Princess,” Edric said, “make 
your choice. You have been chos- 
en as an instrument of destiny, 
the very finest ...” 

“Save your praise for those who 
can be swayed by it,” Irulan said. 
“Earlier, you mentioned a ghost, 
a revenant with which we may 
contaminate the Emperor. Ex- 
plain this.” 

“The Atreides will defeat him- 
self!” Ekiric crowed. 

“Stop talking riddles!” Irulan 
snapped. “What is this ghost?” 
“A very imusual ghost,” Edric 
said. “It has a body and a name. 
The body — that’s the flesh of a 
renowned swordmaster known as 
Duncan Idaho. The name ...” 
“Idaho’s dead,” Irulan said. 
“Paul has mourned the loss often 
in my presence. He saw Idaho 
killed by my father’s Sardariker.” 
“Even in "defeat,” Edric said, 
“your father’s Sardaukar did not 
abandon wisdom. Let us suppose 
a wise Sardaukar commander rec- 
ognized the swordmaster in a 
corpse his men had slain. What 
then? There exist uses for such 
flesh and training . , . if one acts 
swiftly.” 

17 



‘•A Tleilaxu gKola,” Inilan 
wfais^ed, looking sideways at 
Scytale. 

Scytale, observing Her atten- 
tion, exercised Bis face dancer 
powers — sBape flowing into 
sHape moving and readjusting. 
Presently, a slender man stood 
before ber. The face remained 
somewhat rotmd, but darker and 
with slightly flattened features. 
High cheekbones formed shelves 
for eyes with definite epicanthic 
folds. The hair was black and 
unnily. 

“A ghola of tiiis appearance,” 
Edric said, pointing to Scytale. 

“Or merely another face danc- 
er?” Irulan asked. 

“No face dancer,” Edric said. 
“A face dancer risks exposure un- 
der prolonged surveillance. No, let 
us assume that our wise Sardau- 
kar commander Had Idaho’s 
corpse preserved for the axlotl 
tanks. Why not? This corpse held 
the flesh and nerves of one of the 
finest swordsmen in history, an 
adviser to the Atreides, a military 
genius. What a waste to lose all 
that training and ability when it 
might be revived as an instructor 
for the Sardaukar.” 

“I heard not a whisper of this 
and I was one of my father’s 
confidants,” Irulan said. 

“Ahh, but your father was a 
defeated man and within a few 
hours you had been sold to the 
new Emperor,” Edric said. 

18 



“Was it done?” she demanded. 

W ith a maddening air of com- 
placency, Edric said: “Let 
us presume that our wise Sardau- 
kar commander, knowing tfie need 
for speed, immediately sent the 
preserved flesh of Idaho to the 
Bene Tleilax. Let us suppose fur- 
ther that the commander and his 
men died before conveying this 
information to your father — 
who couldn’t have made much ^ 
use of it anyway. There would 
remain then a physical fact, a bit 
of flesh which had been sent off 
to the Tleilaxu. There was only 
one way for it to be sent of course, 
on a Heighliner. We of the Guild 
naturally know every cargo we 
transport. Learning of this one, 
would we not think it additional 
wisdom to purchase the ghola as 
a gift befitting an Emperor?” 
“You’ve done it then,” Irulan 
said. 

Scytale, who had resumed his 
roly-poly first appearance, said: 
“As our long-winded friend in- 
dicates, we’ve done it.” 

“How has Idaho been condi- 
tioned?” Irulan asked. 

“Idaho?” Edric asked, looking 
at the Tleilaxu. “Do you know of 
an Idaho, Scytale?” 

“We sold you a creature called 
Hayt,” Scytale said. 

"Ah, yes — Hayt,” Edric said. 
“Why did you sell him to us?” 
“Because we once bred a kwi- 
GALAXY 



sate KaderacR of our own,” Scy- 
tale said. 

With a qxiick movement of her 
old head, the Reverend Mother 
looked up at him. “You didn’t 
tell us that!” she accused. 

“You didn’t ask,” Scytale said. 

“How did you overcome your 
kwisatz Raderach?” Irulan asked. 

“A creatare who has spent his 
life creating one particular repre- 
sentation of his selfdom will die 
rather than become the antithesis 
of that representation,” Scytale 
said. 

“I do not understand,” Edric 
ventured. 

“He killed himself,” the Rever- 
end Mother growled. 

“Follow me well. Reverend 
Mother,” Scytale warned, us- 
ing a voice mode which said: 
‘You are not a sex object, have 
never been a sex object, cannot 
be a sex object.’ 

The Tleilaxu waited for the 
blatant emphasis to sink in. She 
must not mistake his intent. Re- 
alization must pass through an- 
ger into- awareness that the Tlei- 
laxu certainly could not make 
such an accusation, knowing as 
he must the breeding require- 
ments of the Sisterhood. His 
words though, contained a gutter 
insult, completely out of char- 
acter for Tleilaxu. 

Swiftly, using the tnirabRasa 
placative mode, Edric tried to 
smooth over the moment. “Scy- 
DUNE MESSIAH 



tale, you told us you sold Hayt 
because you shared a desire on 
how to use him.” 

“Edric, you must remain silent 
imtil I give you permission to 
speak,” Sc3dale said. And as the 
Guildsman started to protest, the 
Reverend Mother snapped: “Shut 
up, Edric!” 

The Guildsman drew back into 
his tank in flailing agitation. 

“Our own transient motions 
aren’t pertinent to a solution of 
the mutual problem,” Scytale 
said. “They cloud reasoning be- 
cause the only relevant emotion 
is the basic fear which brought 
us to this meeting.” 

“We understand,” Irulan said, 
glancing at the Reverend Mother. 

“You must see the dangerous 
limitations of our shield,” Scy- 
tale said, “The oracle cannot 
chance upon what it cannot un- 
derstand.” 

“You are devious, Scytale,” 
Irulan said. 

ow devious she 'must not 
guess, Sc3Ttale thought. When 
this is done, we will possess a 
kwisatz Radetach we can control. 
These others will possess noth- 
ing. 

“What was tfie origin of your 
kwisatz haderach?” the Reverend 
Mother asked. 

“We’ve dabbled in curious blue 
essences,” Scytale said. “Pure 
good and pure evil. A pure villain 

19 




who delights only in creating pain 
and terror can be quite educa- 
tional.” 

“The old Baron Harkonnen, 
our Emperor’s maternal grandfa- 
ther, was he a Tleilaxu crea- 
tion?” Irulan asked. 

“Not one of ours,” Scytale said, 
“But then nature often produces 
creations as deadly as ours. We 
merely produce them imder con- 
ditions where we can study them.” 

“I will not be passed by and 
treated this way!” Edric protest- 
ed. “Who is it hides this meeting 
from ...” 

“You see?” Sc3rtale asked. 
“Whose best judgment conceals 
us? What judgment?” 

“I wish to discuss our mode of 
giving Hayt to the Emperor,” Ed- 
ric insisted. “It’s my imderstand- 
ing that Hayt reflects the old 
morality that the Atreides learned 
on his birthworld. Hayt is sup- 
posed to make it easy for the 
Emperor to enlarge his moral na- 
ture, to delineate the positive- 
negative elements of life and re- 
ligion.” 

Scytale smiled, passing a be- 
nign gaze over his companions. 
They were as he’d been led to ex- 
pect. The old Reverend Mother 
wielded her emotions like a 
scythe. Irulan had been well 
trained for a task at which she 
had failed, a flawed Bene Gesserit 
creation. Edric was no more (and 
no less) than the magician’s hand; 

20 



he might conceal and distract. 
For now, Edric relapsed into sul- 
len silence as the others ignored 
him. 

“Do I understand that this 
Hayt is intended to poison Ifni’s 
psyche?” Irulan asked. 

“More or less,” Sc3d:ale said. 

“And what of the Qizarate?” 
Irulan asked. 

“It requires only the slightest 
shift in emphasis, a glissade of the 
emotions, to transform envy into 
enmity,” Scytale said. 

“And CHOAM?*’ Irulan asked. 

“They will rally round profit,” 
Scytale said. 

“What of the other power 
groups?” 

“One invokes the name of gov- 
ernment,” Scytale said. “We will 
annex the less powerful in the 
name of morality and progress. 
Our opposition will die of its 
own entanglements.” 

“Aha, too?” 

“Hayt is a multi-purpose gho- 
la,” Scytale said. “The Emperor’s 
sister is of an age when she can 
be distracted by a charming male 
designed for toat purpose. She 
will be attracted by his maleness 
and by his abilities as a mentat.” 

Mohiam allowed her old eyes 
to go wide in surprise. “The gho- 
la’s a mentat? That’s a dangerous 
move.” 

“To be accurate,” Irulan said, 
“a mentat must have accurate 
data. What if Paul asks him to 

GALAXY 



define the purpose behind out 
gift?” 

“Hayt will tell ifie truth,” Scy- 
tale said. “It makes no diffei;-' 
ence.” 

“So you leave an escape door; 
open for Paul,” Irulan said. 

“A mentat!” MoEam muttered. 

Qcytale glanced at the old Rev- 
^ erend Mother, seeing the an- 
cient hates which colored her re- 
sponses. From the days of the 
Butlerian Jihad when thinking 
machines had been wiped from 
most of the universe, computers 
had inspired distrust. Old emo- 
tions colored the human computer 
as well. 

“I do not like the way you 
smile,” MoEam said abruptly, 
speaking in the truth mode as she 
glared up at Scytale. 

In the same mode, Scytale said; 
“And I tEnk less of what pleases 
you. But we must work together. 
We all see that.” He glanced at 
the Guildsman. “Don’t we, Ed- 
ric?” 

“You teach painful lessons,” 
Edric said. “I presume you wish- 
ed to make it plain that I must 
not assert myself agamst the 
combined judgments of my fel- 
low conspirators.” 

“You see, he can be taught,” 
Scytale said. 

“I see other things as well,” 
Edric growled. “The Atreides 
holds a monoply on the spice. 
DUNE MESS!AH 



Without it I cannot probe the 
future. The Bene Gesserite lose 
their truthsense. We Have stock- 
piles, but these are fimte. Me- 
lange is a powerful coin.” 

“Our civilization has more than 
one com,” Scytale said. “Thus, 
the law of supply and demand 
fails.” 

“You tEnk to steal the secret 
of it,” Mohiam wheezed. “And 
Em with a planet guarded by his 
mad Fremen;” 

“The Fremen are civil, educat- 
ed and ignorant,” Scytale said. 
“They’re not mad. They’re train- 
ed to believe, not to know. Be- 
lief can be mampulated. Only 
knowledge is dangerous.” 

“But will I be left with some- 
thing to father a royal dynasty?” 
Irulan asked. 

They all heard the commitment 
in her voice, but only Edric 
smiled at it. 

“SometEng,” Scytale said. 
“Something.” 

“It means the end of tEs Atrei- 
des as a ruling force,” Edric said. 

“I should imagine that others 
less gifted as oracles have made 
that prediction,” Scytale said 
“For them, mektub al mellah, as 
the Fremen say,” 

“The thing was written with 
salt,” Irulan translated. 

As she spoke, Scytale recog- 
mzed what the Bene Gesserit had 
arrayed here for him — a beauti- 
ful and inteUigent female who 

21 



could never be his. Ah well, he 
thought, perhaps Fll copy her 
for another. 

II 

T he streets had been ankle deep 
in sand blown over the Shield 
Wall on the stratus wind. Foot 
traffic had churned it into chok- 
ing dust which clogged stillsuit 
filters. He could smell the dust 
even now despite a blower clean- 
ing at the portals of his Keep. It 
was an odor full of desert memo- 
ries. 

Other days . other dangers. 
Compared to those other days 
the peril in his lonely walks re- 
mained minor. But putting on a 
stillsuit, he put on the desert. The 
suit with all its apparatus for 
reclaiming his bod5^s moisture, 
guided his thoughts in subtle 
ways, fixed his movements in a 
desert pattern. He became wild 
Fremen. More than a disguise, 
the suit made of him a stranger 
to his city self. In the stillsuit, 
he abandoned security and put 
on the old skills of violence. 
Pilgrims and townfolk passed 
him then with eyes downcast. 
They left the wild ones strictly 
alone out of prudence. If the des- 
ert had a face for city folk, it was 
a Fremen face concealed by a 
stillsuit’s mouth-nose filters. 

In truth, there existed now only 
the small danger that someone 
22 



from the old sietch days might 
<mark him by his walk, by his 
odor or by his eyes. Even then, 
chances of meeting an enemy re- 
mained small. 

A swish of door hangings and 
a wash of light broke his reverie. 
Chani entered bearing his coffee 
service on a platinum tray. Two 
slaved glowglobes followed her, 
darting to their positions; one at 
the head of their bed, one hover- 
ing beside her to light her work. 

Chani moved with an ageless 
air of fragile power — so self-con- 
tained, so vulnerable. Something 
about the way she bent over the 
coffee service reminded him then 
of their first days. Her features 
remained darkly elfin, seeming- 
ly unmarked by their years — 
unless one examined the outer 
corners of her whiteless eyes, not- 
ing the lines there; “sandtracks,” 
the Fremen of the desert called 
them. 

Steam wafted from the pot as 
she lifted the lid by its Hagar 
emerald knob. He could tell the 
coffee wasn’t yet ready by the 
way she replaced the lid. The 
pot — fluting silver female shape, 
pregnant — had come to him as 
a ^hanima, a spoil of battle won 
when he’d slain the former own- 
er in single combat. Jamis, thafd 
been the man’s name . Jamis. 
What an odd immortality death 
had earned for Jamis. Knowing 
death to be inevitable, had Jamis 

GALAXY 



carried that particular one in his 
mind? 

Chani put out cups; blue pot- 
tery squatting like attendants be- 
neath the immense pot. There 
were three cups, one for each 
drinker and one for all the for- 
mer owners. 

“It’ll only be a moment,” she 
^aid. 

She looked at him then, and 
Paul wondered how he appeared 
in her eyes. Was he yet the ex- 
otic offworlder, slim and wiry but 
water-fat when compared to Fre- 
men? Had he remained the Usui 
of his tribal name who’d taken 
Her in “Fremen tau” while they’d 
been fugitives in the desert? 

Paul stared down at 'his own 
body; hard muscles, slender . 
a few more scars, but essentially 
the same despite twelve years as 
Emperor. Looking up, he 
glimpsed his face in a shelf mir- 
ror — blue-blue Fremen eyes — 
mark of spice addiction — and 
a sharp Atreides nose. He looked 
the proper grandson for an Atrei- 
des who’d died in the bull ring 
creating a spectacle for, his peo- 
ple. 



Qomething the old man had said 
slipped then into Paul’s 
mind; “One who rules assumes 
irrevocable responsibility for the 
ruled. You are a husbandman. 
This demands, at times, a self- 
less act of love which may only 
DUNE MESSIAH 



be amusini to those who rule.” 

People still remembered that 
old man with affection. 

And what have I done for the 
Atreides name? Paul asked him- 
self. I’ve loosed the wolf amon^ 
the sheep. 

For a moment, he contemplated 
all the death and violence going 
on in his name. 

“Into bed now!” Chani said in 
a sharp tone of command that 
Paul knew would have shocked 
his Imperial subjects. 

He obeyed, lay back with His 
hands behind his head, letting 
himself be lulled by the pleasant 
familiarity of Chani’s movements. 

The room aroimd them struck 
him suddenly with amusement. 
It was not at all what the popu- 
lace must imagine as the Emper- 
or’s bedchamber. The yellow light 
of restless glowglobes moved the 
shadows in an array of colored 
glass jars on a shelf behind Chani. 
Paul named their contents silent- 
ly — the dry ingredients of the 
desert pharmacopeia, ungents, in- 
cense, mementos ... a pinch of 
sand from Sietch Tabr, a lock of 
hair from their firstborn . long 
dead . twelve years dead . 
an innocent bystander killed in 
the battle that Had made Paul 
Emperor. 

The rich odor of spice coffee 
filled the room. Paul inhaled, his 
glance falling on a yellow bowl 
beside the tray where Chani was 

23 



preparing the coffee. The bowl 
held ground nuts. The inevitable 
poison snooper mounted beneath 
the table waved its insect arms 
over the food. The snooper an- 
gered him. They’d never needed 
snoopers in the desert days! 

“Coffee’s ready,” Chani said. 
“Are you hungry?” 

His angry denial was drowned 
in the whistling scream of a spice 
lighter hurling itself spaceward 
from the field outside Arrakeen. 

Chani saw his anger, though; 
she poured their coffee, put a cup 
near his hand. She sat down on 
the foot of the bed, exposed his 
legs and rubbed them where the 
muscles were knotted from walk- 
ing in the stillsuit. Softly, with a 
casual air which did not deceive 
him, she said: “Let us discus Iru- 
lan’s desire for a child.” 

Paul’s eyes snapped wide open. 
He studied Chani carefully. “Iru- 
lan’s been back from WallacH 
less than two days,” he said. “Has 
she been at you already?” 
“We’ve not discussed her frus- 
trations,” Chani said. 

P aul forced his mind to mentaf 
alertness, examined Chani 
in the harsh light of observatiori- 
al minutiae, the Bene Gesserit 
Way his mother had taught him 
in violation of her vows. It was 
a thing he didn’t like doing with 
Chani. Part of her hold on him 
lay in the fact he so seldom need- 

24 



ed his tension-building powers 
with her. Chani mostly avoided 
indiscreet questions. She main- 
tained a Fremen sense erf good 
manners. Hers were more often 
practical questions. What inter- 
ested Chani were facts whidi bore 
on the position of her man — his 
strength in Council, the loyalty 
of his Legions, the abilities and 
talents of his allies. Her memory 
held catalogs of names and cross- 
indexed details. She could rat- 
tle off the major weakness of ev- 
ery known enemy, the potential 
dispositions of opposing forces, 
battle plans of their military 
leaders, the tooling and produc- 
tion capacities of basic industries. 

Why now, Paul wondered, ^d 
she ask about Irulan? 

“I’ve troubled your mand,” 
Chani said. 

“What was your intention?” 
She smiled shyly, meetiirg his 
gaze. “If you’re angered, Jove, 
please don’t hide it.” 

Paul sank back against the 
headboard. “Shall I put her 
away?” he asked. “Her use is lim- 
ited now, and I don’t like the 
♦■liingR I sense about her trip home 
to the Sisterhood.” 

“You’ll not put her away,” 
rhani said. She went on massag- 
ing his legs, spoke matter of fact- 
ly: “You’ve said many times she’s 
your contact with our enemies, 
that you can read their plans 
through her actions.” 



GALAXY 



“Then why ask about her de- 
sire for a child?” 

“I think it’d disconcert our en- 
emies and put Irulan in a vulner- 
able position should you make 
her pregnant.” 

He read by the movements of 
her hands on his legs what that 
statement had cost her. A lump 
rose in his throat. Softly, he said: 
“Chani, beloved, I swore an oath 
never to take her into my bed. A 
child would give her too much 
power. Would you have her dis- 
place you?” 

“I have no place.” 

“Not so, Sihaya, my desert 
springtime. What is this sudden 
concern for Irulan?” 

“It’s concern for you, not for 
her! If she carried an Atreides 
child, her friends would question 
her loyalties. The less trust our 
enemies place in her, the less she 
is to them.” 

“A child for her could mean 
your death,” Paul said. “You 
know the plotting in this place.” 
A movement of his arm encom- 
passed the Keep. 

“You must have an heir!” she 
husked. 

“AhhH,” he said. 

So that was it: Chani Had not 
produced a child for him. Some- 
one else, then, must do it. Why 
not Irulan? That was the way 
Chani’s mind worked. And it 
must be done in an act of love 
because all the Empire avowed 
DUNE MESSIAH 



strong taboos against artificial 
ways, Chani had come to a Fre- 
men decision. 

Paul studied Her face in this 
new light. It was a face soft with 
passion, in the sweetness of sleep, 
awash in fears and angers and 
griefs. 

He closed his eyes, and Chani 
came into his memories as a girl 
once more — veiled in springtime, 
singing, waking from sleep beside 
him — so perfect that the very 
vision of her consumed him. In 
his memory, she smiled . shyly 
at first, then strained against the 
vision as though she longed to 
escape. 

■paul’s mouth went dry. For a 
moment, his nostrils tasted 
the smoke of a devasted future 
and the voice of another kind of 
vision commanding Him to disen- 
gage . disengage . disen- 
gage. His prophetic visions had 
been eavesdropping on eternity 
for such a long wEle, catching 
snatches of foreign tongues, lis- 
tening to stones and to flesh not 
his own. Since the day of Es 
first encounter with terrible pur- 
pose, he Had peered at the future, 
hoping to find peace. 

There existed a way, of course. 
He knew it by heart without 
knowing the heart of it — a rote 
future, strict in its instructions 
to him: disengage, disengage, dis- 
engage .

Paiil opened his eyes, looked 
at the decision in Chani’s face. 
She had stopped massaging his 
legs, sat still now — purest Fre- 
men. Her features remained fa- 
miliar beneath the blue nezhoni 
scarf she often wore about Her 
hair in the privacy of their cham- 
bers. But the mask of decision 
sat on her, an ancient and alien- 
to-him way of thinking. Fremen 
women had shared their men for 
thousands of years — not always 
in peace, but with a way of mak- 
ing the fact non-destructive. 
Something mysteriously Fremen 
in this fashion had happened in 
Chani. 

“You’ll give me the only heir 
I want,” he said. 

“You’ve seen this?” she asked, 
making it obvious by her empha- 
sis that she referred to presci- 
ence. 

As he had done many times, 
Paul wondered how he could ex- 
plain the delicacy of the oracle, 
the Timelines without number 
which vision waved’ before him on 
an undulating fabric. He sighed, 
remembered water lifted from a 
river in the hollow of his hands 
— trembling, draining. Memory 
drenched his face in it. How could 
he drench himself in futures grow- 
ing increasingly obscure from the 
pressures of too many oracles? 

“You’ve not seen it, then,” 
Chani said. 

That vision-future scarce any 
26 



longer accessible to him except at 
the expenditure of life-draining 
effort, what could it show them 
except grief? He felt that he oc- 
cupied an inhospitable middle 
zone, a wasted place where his 
emotions drifted, swayed, swept 
outward, in imchecked restless- 
ness. 

Chani covered his legs and 
said; “An heir to House Atreides, 
this is not something you leave 
to chance or one woman.” 

That was a thing his mother 
might have said, Paul thought. 
He wondered if the Lady Jessica 
had been in secret communica- 
tion with Chani. His mother would 
think in terms of House Atreides. 
It was a pattern bred and corr- 
ditioned into her by the Bene 
Gesserit, and would hold true 
even now when her powers were 
turned against the Sisterhood. 

“You listened when Irulan 
came to me today,” he accused. 

“I listened.” She spoke with- 
out looking at him. 

P aul focused his memory on the 
encotmter with Irulan. He’d 
let himself into the family salon, 
noted an unfinished robe on 
Chani’s loom. There’d been an 
acrid wormsmell to the place, an 
e’vil odor which almost hid the 
underlying cinnamon bite of me- 
lange. Someone had spilled un- 
changed spice essence and left it 
to combine there with a spice- 

GALAXY 



based rug. It had not been a fe- 
licitous combination. Spice es- 
sence had dissolved the rug. Oily 
marks lay concealed on the pla- 
stone floor where the rug had 
been. He’d thought to send for 
someone to clean away the mess, 
but Harah, Stilgar’s wife and 
Chani’s closest feminine friend, 
had slipped in to annoimce Iru- 
lan. 

He’d been forced to conduct 
the interview in the presence of 
that evil smell, imable to escape 
a Fremen superstition that evil 
smells foretold disaster. 

Harah withdrew as Irulan en- 
tered. 

“Welcome,” Paul said. 

Irulan wore a robe of gray 
whale fur. She pulled it close, 
touched a hand to her hair. He 
could see her wondering at her 
mild tone. The angry words she 
had ob’viously prepared for this 
meeting could be sensed leaving 
her mind in a welter of second 
thoughts. 

“You came to report that the 
Sisterhood has lost its last vestige 
of morality,” he said. 

“Isn’t it dangerous to be that 
ridiculous?” she asked. 

“To be ridiculous and danger- 
ous, a questionable alliance,” 
he said. His renegade Bene Ges- 
serit training detected her put- 
ting down an impulse to with- 
draw. The effort exposed a brief 
glimpse of underlying fear, and 
DUNE MESSIAH 



he saw she’d been assigned a task 
not to her likii^. 

“They expect a bit too much 
from a princess of the blood roy- 
al,” he said. 

Irulan grew very still, and Paul 
became aware that she had locked 
herself into a viselike control. A 
heavy burden, indeed, he thought. 
And he wondered why prescient 
visions had given him no glimpse 
of this possible future. 

Slowly, Irulan relaxed. There 
was no point in surrendering to 
fear, no point in retreat, she had 
decided. 

“You’ve allowed the weather to 
fall into a very primitive pattern,” 
she said, rubbing her arms 
through the robe. ‘Tt was dry and 
there was a sandstorm today. 
Are you never going to let it 
rain here?” 

“You didn’t come here to talk 
about the weather,” Paul said. 
He felt that he had been submerg- 
ed in double meanings. Was Iru- 
lan trying to tell him something 
which her training would not per- 
mit her to say openly? It seemed 
that way. He felt that he had been 
cast adrift suddenly and now 
must thrash his way back to some 
steady place. 

“I must have a child,” she said. 

TT e shook his head from side to 
side. 

“I must have my way!” she 
snapped. “If need be. I’ll find an- 

27 



1 



other father for my child. I’ll 
cuckhold you and dare you to 
expose me.” 

“Cuckhold me all you wish,” 
he said, “but no child.” 

“How can you stop me?” 

With a smile of utmost kind- 
ness, he said: “I’d have you gar- 
roted, if it came to that.” 

Shocked silence held her for a 
moment, and Paul sensed Chani 
listening behind the heavy drap- 
eries into their private apart- 
ments. 

“I am your wife,” Ihilan whis- 
pered. 

“Let us not have these silly 
games,” he said. “You play a part, 
no more. We both know who my 
wife is.” 

“And I am a convenience, noth- 
ing more,” she said, voice heavy 
with bitterness. 

“I have no wish to be cruel 
to you,” he said. 

“You chose me for this posi- 
tion.” 

“Not I,” fie said. “Fate chose 
you. The Guild chose you. And 
they have chosen you once more. 
For what have they chosen you, 
Irulan?” 

“Why can’t I have your child?” 

“Because that’s a role for which 
you weren’t chosen.” 

“It’s my right to bear the royal 
heir! My father was ...” 

“Your father was and is a 
beast. We both know he’d lost 
almost all touch with the humani- 

28 



ty he was supposed to rule and 
protect.” 

“Was he hated less than you’re 
hated?” she flared. 

“A good question,” he agreed, 
a sardonic smile touching the 
edges of his mouth. 

“You say you’ve no wish to be 
cruel to me, yet ...” 

“And that’s why I agree that 
you can take any lover you 
choose. But understand me well: 
take a lover, but bring no sour- 
fathered child into my household, 
I would deny such a child. I 
don’t begrudge you any male al- 
liance \as long as you are discreet 
. and childless. I’d be silly to 
feel otherwise imder the circum- 
stances. But don’t presume upon 
this license which I freely bestow. 
Where the throne is concerned, I 
control what blood is heir to it. 
The Bene Gesserit doesn’t control 
this, nor does the Guild. This is 
one of the privileges I won when 
I smashed your father’s Sardau- 
kar legions out there on the Plain 
of Arrakeen.” 

“It’s on your head, then,” Iru- 
lan said. She whirled and swept 
out of the chamber. 

R emembering the encounter 
now, Paul brought his aware- 
ness out of it and focused on 
Chani seated beside him on their 
bed. He could understand his am- 
bivalent feelings about Irulan, 
understand Chani’s Fremen de- 

GALAXY 



cision. Under other circumstances 
Chani and Irulan might have 
been friends. 

“What have you decided?” 
Chani asked. 

“No child,” he said. 

Chani made the Fremen crys- 
knife sign with index finger and 
thumb of her right hand. 

“It could come to that,” he 
agreed. 

“You don’t think a child would 
solve anything with Irulan?” she 
asked. 

“Only a fool would think that.” 
“I am not a fool, my love.” 
Anger possessed him. “I’ve 
never said you were! But this isn’t 
some damned romantic novel we 
are discussing. That’s a real prin- 
cess down the hall. She was raised 
in all the nasty intrigues of an 
Imperial Court. Plotting is as nat- 
ural to her as writing her stupid 
histories!” 

“They are not stupid, love.” 
“Probably not.” He brought his 
anger under control, took her 
hand in his. “Sorry. But that 
woman has many plots — plots 
within plots. Give in to one of 
her ambitions and you could ad- 
vance another of them.” 

Her voice mild, Chani said: 
“Haven’t I always said as much?” 
“Yes, of course you have.” He 
stared at her. “Then what are 
you really trying to say to me?” 
She lay down beside him, 
placed her head against his neck. 
DUNE MESSIAH 



“They have come to a decision 
on how to fight you,” she said. 
“Irulan reeks of secret decisions.” 

Paul stroked her hair. 

Chani had peeled away the 
dross. 

'T^errible purpose brushed him. 

It was a Coriolis wind in his 
soul. It whistled through the 
framework of his being. His body 
knew things then never learned in 
consciousness. 

“Chani, beloved,” he whimpered, 
“do you know what I’d spend to 
end the Jihad — to separate my- 
self from the damnable godhead 
the Qizarate forces onto me?” 

She trembled. “You have but 
to command it,” she said. 

“Oh, no. Even if I died now, 
my name would still lead them. 
When I think of the Atreides 
name tied to this religious butch- 
ery ... ” 

“But you’re the Emperor! You 
have ...” 

“I’m a figurehead. When god- 
fiead’s given, that’s the one thing 
the so-called god no longer con- 
trols.” A bitter laugh shook hhn. 
He sensed the future looking back 
at him out of dynasties not even 
dreamed. He felt his being cast 
out, crying, unchained from the 
rings of fate — only his name 
continued. “I was chosen,” he 
"^said. “Perhaps at birth . cer- 
tainly before I had much say in 
it. I was chosen.” 



29 



“Then un-choose,” she said. 
His arm tightened around Her 
shoulder. “In time, beloved. Give 
me yet a little time.” 

Unshed tears burned his eyes. - 
“We should retirni to Sietch 
Tabr,” Chani said. “There’s too 
much to contend with in this tent 
of stone.” 

He nodded, his dun moving 
against the smooth fabric of the 
scarf which covered her hair. The 
soothing spice smell of her filled 
his nestrils. 

Sietch. The ancient Chakohsa 
word absorbed him: a place of 
retreat and safety in a time of 
peril Chani’s suggestion made 
t»im long for vistas of open sand, 
for clean distances where one 
could see an enemy coming from 
a long way off. 

“The tribes expect Muad’dib to 
return to them,” she said. She lift= 
ed her head to look at him. “You 
belong to us.” 

“I belong to a vision,” he 
whispered. 

He thought then of the Jihad, 
of the gene mingling across par- 
secs and the vision which told 
him how he might end it Should 
he pay the price? All the Hate- 
fulness would evaporate, dying as 
fires die — ember by ember. But 
. ©h! The terrifying price! 

I never wanted to be a §od, 
thou^t. I wanted only to disap- 
pear like a jewel oi trace dew 
caught by the mortdng. I wanted 

30 



to escape the angels and the 
damned — alone ... as though 
by an oversight. 

“Will we go back to the 
Sietch?” Chani pressed. 

“Yes,” he whispered. And He 
thought: I must pay the price. 

Chani heaved a deep sigh, set- 
tled back against him. 

I’ve loitered, he thought And 
he saw how he’d been hemmed in 
by boundaries of love and the 
Jihad. But what was one life, no 
matter how beloved, against all 
the lives the Jihad was certain to 
take? Could single misery be 
weighed against the agony of 
multitudes? 

“Love?” Chani said, question- 
ing. 

He put a hand against her lips. 

J ’ll yield up myselt, he thought 
I’ll rush out while I yet have 
the strength, ily through a space 
a bird might not iind. It was a 
useless thought, and He knew it. 
The Jihad would follow his ghost. 

What could he answer? he 
wondered. How explain when 
people taxed him with brutal fool- 
ishness? Who might understand? 

I wanted only to look back 
and say: ’There! There’s an ex- 
istence which couldn’t hold me. 
See! I vanish! No restraint or net 
oi human devising can trap me 
ever again. I renounce my reli- 
gion! This glorious instant is 
mine! I’m free!’ 



GALAXY 



What empty words these are! 

“A big worm was seen below 
the Shield Wall yesterday,” Chani 
said. “More than a hundred me- 
ters long, they say. Such big ones 
come rarely into this region any 
more. The water repels them, I 
suppose. They say this one came 
to summon Muad’dib home to 
his desert.” She pinched his chest 
“Don’t laugh at me!” 

“I’m not laughing.” 

Paul, caught by wonder at the 
persistent Fremen mythos, felt a 
heart constriction, a thing inflict- 
ed upon his lifeline: adab, the 
demanding memory. He recalled 
his childhood room on Caladan 
then . dark night in the stone 
chamber ... a vision! It’d been 
one of his earliest prescient mo- 
ments. 

He felt his mind dive into 
the vision, saw 'through a veiled 
cloud-memory (vision-within-vi- 
sion) a line of Fremen, their 
robes trimmed with dust. They 
paraded past a gap in tall rocks. 
They carried a long, cloth-wrap- 
ped burden. 

And Paul heard himself say in 
the vision: “It was mostly sweet 
. but you were the sweetest of 
all ... ” 

Adab released hirrt. 

“You’re so quiet,” Chani whis- 
pered. “What is it?” 

Paul shuddered, sat up, face 
averted. 

“You’re angry because I’ve 
DUNE AVESSIAH 



been to the desert’s ed^” Chani 
said. 

He shook his head without 
speaking. 

“I only went because I want a 
child,” Chani said. 

Paul was imable to ffpeak. He 
felt himself consumed by the raw 
power of that early vision. Terri- 
ble purpose! In that moment, his 
whole life was a limb shaken by 
the departure of a bird . and 
the bird was chance. 

I succumbed to the hire oi the 
oracle, he thought. 

And he sensed that succumb- 
ing to this lure might be to fix 
himself upon a single-track life. 
Could it be, he wondered, that 
the oracle didn’t tell the future? 
Could it be that the oracle 
made the future? Had he 
exposed his life to some web 
of underlsdng threads, trapped 
himself there in that long-ago 
awakening, victim of a spider- 
future which even now advanced 
upon him with terrifying jaws. 

\ Bene Gesserit axiom slipped 
into his mind: “To use raw 
power is to make yourself infin- 
itely vulnerable to greater powers. 

“I know it angers you,” Chani 
said, touching his arm. “It’s true 
that the tribes have revived the 
old rites and the blood sacrifices, 
but I took no part in those.” 

Paul inhaled a deep, trembling 
breath. The torrent of his vision 

31 



dissipated, became a deep, still 
place whose currents moved with 
absorbing power beyond his reach. 

“Please,” Chani begged. “I 
want a child, our child. Is that 
a terrible thing?” 

Paul caressed her arm where 
she touched him, pulled away. 
He climbed from the bed, extin- 
guished the glowglobes, crossed to 
the balcony window, opened the 
draperies. The deep desert could 
not intrude here except by its 
odors. A windowless wall climbed 
to the night sky across from him. 
Moonlight slanted down into an 
enclosed garden, sentinel trees and 
broadleaves, wet foliage. He could 
see a fishpond reflecting stars 
among the leaves, pockets of white 
floral brilliance in the shadows. 
Momentarily, he saw the garden 
through Fremen eyes: alien,^ men- 
acing, dangerous in its waste of 
water. 

He thought of the Water Sell- 
ers, their way destroyed by the 
lavish dispensing from his hands. 
They hated him. He’d slain their 
past. And there were others, even 
those who’d fought for the sols 
to buy precious water, who hated 
him for changing the old ways. 
As the ecological pattern dictated 
by Muad’dib remade the planet’s 
landscape, human resistance in- 
creased. Was it not presumptuous, 
he wondered, to think he could 
make over an entire planet — 
eversdhing growing where and 
32 



how lie told it to grow? Even if 
he succeeded, what of the universe 
waiting out there? Did it fear sim- 
ilar treatment? 

Abruptly, lie closed the drap- 
eries, sealed the ventilators. He 
turned toward Chani in the dark- 
ness, felt her waiting there. Her 
water rings tinkled like the ahns- 
bells of pilgrims. He groped his 
way to the sound, encountered 
her outstretched arms. 

“Beloved,” she whispered. 
“Have I troubled you?” 

Her arms, enclosed his future 
as they enclosed him. 

“Not you,” he said. “OH . 
not you.”

The advent of the Field Proc- 
ess shield and the las^un with 
their explosive interaction, deadly 
to attacker and attacked, placed 
the current determinatives on 
weapons technology. We need not 
go into the special role of atom- 
ics. The fact that any Family in 
my Empire could so deploy its 
atomics as to destroy the plane- 
tary bases of fifty or more other 
Families causes some nervousness, 
true. But all of us possess pre- 
cautionary plans for devastating 
retaliation. Guild and Landsraad 
contain the keys which hold this 
force in check. No, my concern 
goes to the development of hu- 
mans as special weapons. Here is

a virtually unlimited field which 
a few powers are developing. 

— Muad’dib : Lecture to the 
War College from the 
Stilgar Chronicle 

T he old man stood in his door- 
way peering out with blue- 
in-blue eyes. The eyes were veiled 
by that native suspicion all desert 
folk held for strangers. Bitter 
lines tortured the edges of his 
mouth where it could be seen 
through a fringe of white beard. 
He wore no stillsuit, and it said 
much that he ignored this fact 
in the full knowledge of the mois- 
ture pouring from his house 
through the open door. 

Scytale bowed, gave the greet- 
ing signal of the conspiracy. 
From somewhere behind the old 
man came the sound of a rebeck 
wailing through the atonal dis- 
sonance of semuta music. The old 
man’s manner carried no drug 
dullness, an indication that se- 
muta was the weakness of anoth- 
er. It seemed strange to Sesdale, 
though, to find that sophisticated 
vice in this place, 

“Greetings from afar,” Sesdale 
said, smiling through the flat- 
featured face he had chosen for 
this encounter. It occurred to him, 
then, that this old' man might 
recognize the chosen face. Some 
of the older Fremen here on Dune 
had known Duncan Idaho. 

The choice of features, which 
DUNE MESSIAH 



he had thought amusing, might 
have been a mistake, Scytale de- 
cided. But he dared not change 
the face out here; He cast nerv- 
ous glances up and down the 
street. Would the old man never 
invite him inside? 

“Did you know my son?” the 
old man asked. 

That, at least, was one of the 
countersigns. Scytale made the 
proper response, all the time keep- 
ing his eyes alert for any suspi- 
cious circumstance in his sur- 
roundings. He did not like his 
position here. The street was a 
cul-de-sac ending in this house. 
The houses all around had been 
built for veterans of the Jihad. 
They formed a suburb of Arra- 
keen which stretched into the Im- 
perial Basin past Tiemag. The 
walls which hemmed in this street 
presented blank faces of dun plas- 
meld broken by dark shadows of 
sealed doorways and, here and 
there, scrawled obscenities. Beside 
this very door someone had chalk- 
ed a pronouncement that one 
Beris had brought back to Arrakis 
a loathsome disease which de- 
prived him of his manhood. 

Do you come in partnership,” 
the old man asked. 

“Alone,” Scytale said, 

The old man cleared his throat, 
still hesitating in that maddening 
way. 

Scjrtale cautioned Himself to 
patience. Contact in this fashion 

33 



carried its own dangers. Perliaps 
tiie old man knew some reason for 
carrying on this way. It was the 
proper hour, though. The pale 
sun stood almost directly over- 
head. People of this quarter re- 
mained sealed in their houses to 
sleep through the hot part of the 
day. 

Was it the new neighbor who 
bothered the old man? Scsdale 
wondered. The adjoining house, 
he knew, had been assigned to 
Otheym, once a member of Mu- 
ad’dib’s dreaded Fedaykin death 
commandos. Bijaz. the catalyst- 
dwarf waited with Otheym. 

Qcytale returned his gaze to the 
old man, noted the empty 
sleeve dangling from the left 
shoulder and the lack of a still- 
suit. An air of command hung 
about this old man. He’d been 
no foot slogger in the Jihad. 

“May I know the visitor’s 
name?” the old man asked. 

Scytale suppressed a sigh of re- 
lief. He was to be accepted, after 
all. “I am Zaal.” he said, giving 
the name assigned him for this 
mission. 

“I am Farok,” the old man 
said, “once Bashar of the Ninth 
Legion in the Jihad. Does this 
mean an3dhing to you?” 

Scytale read menace in the 
words. He said; “You were bom 
in Sietcli Tabr with allegiance to 
Stilgar.” 

34 



Farok relaxed, stepped aside. 
“You are welcome in my house.” 

Scytale slipped past him into 
a shadowy atrium — blue tile ! 
floor, glittering designs worked in 
crystal on the walls. Beyond the , 
atrium was a covered courtyard. 
Light admitted by translucent 1 
filters spread an opalescence as ! 
silvery as the white-nigHt of First 
Moon. The street door grated i 
into its moisture seals behind Him. 

“We were a noble people,” Fa- 
rok said, leading the way toward 
the courtyard. “We were not of 
the cast-out. We lived in no gra- 
ben village . such as this! We 
had a proper sietch in the Shield 
Wall above Habbanya Ridge. 
One worm could carry us into 
Kedem, the inner desert. 

“Not like this,” Scytale agreed, | 
realizing now what had brought 
Farok into the conspiracy. The 
Fremen longed for the old days 
and the old ways. 

They entered the courtyard. 

Farok stmggled with an intense 
dislike for his visitor, Scytale 
realized. Fremen distrusted eyes 
that were not the total blue of 
Ibad. Offworlders, Fremen said, 
had unfocused eyes which saw 
things they were not supposed 
to see. 

The semuta music had stopped 
at their entrance. It was replaced 
now by the strum of a baliset, 
first a nine-scale chord, then the 
clear notes of a song which’ was 

GALAXY 



popular on the Naraj worlds. 

As his eyes adjusted to the 
light, Scytale saw a youth sit- 
ting cross-legged on a low divan 
beneath arches to his right. The 
youth’s eyes were empty sockets. 
With that uncanny facility of 
the blind, fie began singing the 
moment Scytale focused on him. 
The voice was high and sweet; 
“A wind has blown the land 
away 

And blown the sky away 
And all the men! 

Who is this wind? 

The trees stand unbent, 
Drinking where men drank. 
I’ve known too many worlds, 
Too many men. 

Too many trees. 

Too many winds.” 

Those were not the original 
words of the song, Scytale noted. 
Farok led him away from the 
youth and under the arches on 
the opposite side, indicated cush- 
ions scattered over the tile floor. 
The tile was worked into designs 
of sea creatures. 

“There is a cushion once oc- 
cupied in sietch by Muad’dib,” 
Farok said, indicating a round, 
black mound. “It is yours now.” 
“I am in your debt,” Scsdale 
said, sinking to the black mound. 
He smiled. Farok displayed wis- 
dom. A sage spoke of loyalty 
even while listening to songs of 
Hidden meaning and words with 
secret messages. Who could deny 
DUNE MESSIAH 



the terrifying powers of the ty- 
rant Emperor? 

I nserting tus words across the 
song without breaking the 
meter, Farok said; “Does my 
son’s music disturb you?” 

Scytale gestured to a cusEion 
facing Kim, put his back against 
a cool pillar. “I enjoy music.” 
“My son lost his eyes in the 
conquest of Naraj,” Farok said. 
“He was nursed there and should 
Have stayed. No woman of the 
People will have him thus. I find 
it curious, though, to know I 
have grandchildren on Naraj that 
I may never see. Do you know 
the Naraj worlds, Zaal?” 

“In my youth, I toured there 
with a troupe of my fellow face 
dancers,” Scytale said. 

“You are a face dancer, then,” 
Farok said. “I had wondered at 
your features. They reminded me 
of a man I knew here once.” 
“Duncan Idaho?” 

“That one, yes. A swordmas- 
ter in the Emperor’s pay.” 

“He was killed, so it is said.” 
“So it is said,” Farok agreed. 
“Are you truly a man, then? 
I’ve heard stories about face 
dancers that . , ” He shrugged. 

“We are Jadacha hermaphro- 
dites,” Scsdale said, “either sex 
at will. For now, I am a man.” 
Farok pursed his lips in 
thought, then; “May I call for 
refreshments? Do you desire wa- 

35 



ter? Iced fruit? Anytfiing at all?” 

“Talk will suffice,” Scytale 
said. 

“The guest’s wish is a com- 
mand,” Farok said, settling to 
the cushion which faced Scytale. 

“Blessed is Abu d’ Dhur, Fa- 
ther of the Indefinite Roads of 
Time,” Scytale said. And he 
thought: There! I’ve told him 
straight out that I come from a 
Guild Steersman and wear the 
Steersman’s concealment. 

“Thrice blessed,” Farok said, 
folding his hands into his lap in 
the ritual clasp. They were old, 
heavily veined hands. 

“An object seen from a dis- 
tance betrasrs only its principle,” 
Scytale said, revealing that he 
wished to discuss the Emperor’s 
fortress Keep. 

“That which is dark and evil 
may be seen for evil at any dis- 
tance,” Farok said, advising de- 
lay. 

Why? Scytale wondered. But 
he said: “How did your son lose 
his eyes?” 

“The Naraj defenders used a 
stone burner,” Farok said. “My 
son was too closa Cursed atom- 
ics! Even the stone biuner should 
be outlawed.” 

“It skirts the intent of the law,” 
Scytale agreed. And he thought: 
A stone burner on Naraj! We 
weren’t told of that. Why does 
this old man speak of stone 
burners here? 

36 



C < T offered to buy Tkilaxu 
eyes for him from your 
masters,” Farok said. “But 
there’s a story in the Legions 
that Tleilaxu eyes enslave their 
users. My son told me that 
such eyes are metal and he is 
flesh, that such a union must be 
sinful.” 

“The principle of an object 
must fit its original intent,” Scy- 
tale said, tT5dng to turn the con- 
versation back to the informa- 
tion he sought. 

Farok’s lips went thin, but he 
nodded. “Speak openly of what 
you wish,” he said. “We must 
put our trust in your Steersman.” 

“Have you ever entered the 
Imperial Keep?” Scytale asked. 

“I was there for the feast cele- 
brating the Molitor victory. It 
was cold in all that stone despite 
the best Ixian space heaters We 
slept on the terrace of Alia’s 
Fane the night before. He has 
trees in there, you know — trees 
from many worlds. We Bashars 
were dressed in our finest green 
robes and had our tables set 
apart. We ate and drank too 
much. I was disgusted with some 
of the things I saw The walking 
wounded came, dragging them- 
selves along on their crutches. I 
do not think our Muad’dib knows 
how many men he has maimed.” 

“You objected to the feast?” 
Sc3d:ale asked, speaking from a 
knowledge of the Fremen orgies 

GALAXY 



I which were ignited by spice beer. 
“It was not like &e mingling 
of our souls in the sietcH,” Farok 
said. “There was no tau. For en- 
tertainment, the troops had slave 
girls, and the men shared the 
stories of their battles and their 
i woimds.” 

“So you were inside that great 
I pile of stone,” Scytale said. 

“Muad’dib came out to us on 
1 file terrace,” Farok said. “ ‘Good 
! fortune to us all,’ he said. The 
greeting drill of the desert in that 
place!” 

“Do you know the location of 
his private apartments?” Sc5^ale 
asked. 

“Deep inside,” Farok said. 
“Somewhere deep inside. I am 
told he and Chani live a nomadic 
life and that all within the walls 
of their Keep. Out to the Great 
Hall he comes for the public au- 
diences. He has reception halls 
and formal meeting places, a 
whole wing for his personal 
guard, places for the ceremonies 
and an inner section for com- 
munications. There is a room 
far beneath his fortress, I am 
told, where he keeps a stvmted 
worm surrounded by a water 
moat with which to poison it. 
Here is where he reads the fu- 
ture.” 

Myth all tangled up with 
facts, Scytale thought 
“The apparatus of government 
accompanies him everywhere,” 
DUNE MESSIAH 



Farok grumbled. “Clerks and at- 
tendants and attendants for the 
attendants. He trusts only the 
ones such as Stilgar who were 
very close to him in the old 
days.” 

“Not you,” Scytale said. 

“I think he has forgotten my 
existence,” Farok said. 

“How does he come and go 
when he leaves that building?” 
Scytale asked. 

“He has a tiny ’thopter land- 
ing which juts from an iimer 
wall,” Farok said. “I am told 
Muad’dib will not permit another 
to handle the controls for a land- 
ing there. It requires an approach, 
so it is said, where the slightest 
miscalculation would plunge him 
down a sheer cliff of wall into 
one of his accursed gardens.” 

Ocsrtale nodded. This, most 
likely, was true. Such an 
aerial entry to the Emperor’s 
quarters would carry a certain 
measure of security. The Atreid- 
es were superb pilots all. 

“He uses men to carry his dis- 
trans messages,” Farok said. “It 
demeans men to implant wave 
translators in them. A man’s 
voice should be his own to com- 
mand. It should not carry an- 
other man’s message hidden with- 
in its sounds.” 

Scytale shrugged. All great 
powers used the distrans in this 
age. One could never tell what 

37 



obstacle might be placed between 
sender and addressee. The dis- 
trans defied political cryptology 
because it relied on subtle dis- 
tortions of natural sound pat- 
terns which could be scrambled 
with enormous intricacy. 

“Even his tax officials use this 
method,” Farok complained. “In 
my day, the distrans was im- 
planted only in the lower ani- 
mals.” 

But levenae information must 
be kept secret, Scytale thought. 
More than one government has 
fallen because people discovered 
the real extent of official wealth. 

“How do the Fremen cohorts 
feel now about Muad’dib’s Ji- 
had?” Scjrtale asked. “Do they 
object to making a god out of 
their Emperor?” 

“Most of them don’t even con- 
sider this,” Farok said. “They 
think of the Jihad the way I 
thought of it — most of them. It 
is a source of strange experiences, 
adventure, wealth. This graben 
hovel in which I live ...” Farok 
gestured at the courtyard. “ ... it 
cost sixty lidas of spice. Ninety 
kontars! There was a time when 
I could not even imagine such 
riches.” He shook his head. 

Across the courtyard, the blind 
youth took up the notes of a love 
ballad on his baliset. 

Ninety kontars, Scytale thought. 
How strange. Great riches, cer- 
tainly. Farok’s hovel would be a 
38 



palace on many another world, 
but all things were relative — 
even the kontar. Did Farok, for 
example, know whence came his 
measure for this weight of spice? 
Did he ever think of himseH that 
one and a half kontar once lim- 
ited a camel load? Not likely. 
Farok might never even have 
heard of a camel or of the Gold- 
en Age of Earth. 

His words oddly in rhythm to 
the m.elody of his son’s baliset, 
Farok said: “I owned a crysknife, 
water rings to ten liters, my own 
lance which had been my father’s, 
a coffee service, a bottle made of 
red glass older than any memory 
in my sietch. I had my own 
share of our spice, but no money. 
I was rich and did not know it. 
Two wives I had: one plain and 
dear to me, the other stupid and 
obstinate, but with form and face 
of an angel. I was a Fremen naib, 
a rider of worms, master of the 
leviathan and of the sand.” 

The youth across the court- 
yard picked up the beat of his 
melody. 

“I knew many things without 
the need to think about them,” 
Farok said. “I knew there was 
water far beneath our sand, held 
there in. bondage by the Little 
Makers. I knew that my ances- 
tors sacrificed virgins to Shai- 
hulud . before Liet-Kynes 
made us stop. It was wrong for 
us to stop. I had seen the jewels 

GALAXY 



in the mouth of a worm. My soul 
had four gates and I knew them 
all.” 

e fell silent, musing. 

“Then the Atreides came 
with Kis witcH mother,” Sc3rtale 
' said. 

I “The Atreides came,” Farok 
agreed. “The one we named Usui 
in our sietch, his private name 
: among us. Our Muad’dib, our 
: Mahdi! And when he called for 
I the Jihad, I was one of those who 
; asked: ‘Why should I go to fight 
I there? I have no relatives there.’ 

I But other men went — young 
! men, friends, companions of my 
! childhood. When they returned, 

I they spoke of wizardry, of the 
power of this Atreides savior. He 
fought our enemy, the Harkon- 
i nen. Liet-Kynes, who had prom- 
; ised us paradise upon our plan- 
et, blessed him. It was said this 
Atreides came to change our 
world and our universe, that he 
j was the man to make the golden 
flower blossom in the night.” 
Farok held up his hands, ex- 
amined the palms. “Men pointed 
[to First Moon and said: ‘His 
j soul is there.’ Thus, he was 
I called Muad’dib. I did not un- 
der stand all this.” 

He lowered his hands, stared 
across the courtyard at his son. 
“I had no thoughts in my head. 
There were thoughts only in my 
heart, my, belly and my loins. 
DUNE MESSIAH 



Again, the tempo of the back- 
ground music increased. 

“Do you know why I enlisted 
in the Jihad?” The old eyes 
stared hard at Sc5^ale. “I Heard 
there was a thing called a sea. It 
is very hard to believe in a sea 
when you have lived only here 
among our dunes. We have no 
seas. Men of Dune have never 
known a sea. We had our wind- 
traps. We collected water for the 
great change Liet-Kynes prom- 
ised us . this great change 
Muad’dib is bringing with a wave 
of his hand. I could imagine a 
qanat, water flowing across the 
land in a canal. From tlus, my 
mind could picture a river. But 
a sea?” 

Farok gazed at the translu- 
cent cover of his courtyard as 
though trying to probe into the 
universe beyond. “A sea,” he 
said, voice low. “It was too 
much for my mind to picture. 
Yet, men I ^ew said they had 
seen this marvel. I thought they 
lied, but I had to know for my- 
self. It was for this reason that 
I enlisted.” 

The youth struck a loud final 
chord on the baliset, took up a 
new song with an oddly undulat- 
ing rhythm. 

“Did you find your sea?” Scy- 
tale asked. 

Farok remained silent and Scy- 
tale thought the old man had 
not heard. The baliset music rose 

39 




around them and fell like a tidal 
movement Farok breathed to its 
rhythm. 

“There was a sunset,” Farok 
said presently. “One of the elder 
artists might have painted such 
a sunset. It had red in it the color 
of the glass in my bottle. There 
was gold . blue. It was on the 
world they call Enfeil, the one 
where I led my Legion to victory. 
We came out of a mountain 
pass where the air was sick with 
water. I could scarcely breathe 
it. And there below me was the 
thing my friends had told me 
about: water as far as I could see 
and farther. We marched down 
to it. I waded out into it and 
drank. It was bitter and made 
me ill. But the wonder of it has 
never left me.” 

Scytale found himself shar- 
ing the old Fremen’s awe. 

“I immersed myself in that 
sea,” Farok said, looking down 
at the water creatures worked in- 
to the tiles of his floor. “One 
man sank beneath that water... 
another man arose from it I felt 
that I could remember a past 
which had never been. I stared 
around me with eyes which could 
accept anything . anything at 
all. I saw a body in the water — 
one of the defenders we had slain. 
There was a log nearby support- 
ed on that water, a piece of a 
great tree. I can close my eyes 
now and see that log. It was 
40 



black on one end from a fire. And 
there was a piece of cloth in that 
water — no more than a yeUow 
rag . torn, dirty. I looked at 
all these things and I understood 
why they had come to this place. 
It was for me to see tliem.” 
Forak turned slowly, stared in- ‘ 
to Scytale’s eyes. “The universe 
is unfinished, you know,” he said. 

T his one is garrulous, but deep, 
Scytale thought. And he 
said: “I can see it made a pro- 
found impression on you.” 

“You are a Tleilaxu,” Farok 
said. “You have seen many seas. 

I have seen only this one, yet I 
know a thing about seas which i 
you do not.” I 

Scytale found himself in the | 
grip of an odd feeling of <fis- , 
quiet. 

“The Mother of Chaos was 
bom in a sea,” Farok said. “A 
Qizara Tafwid stood nearby when 
I came dripping from that wa- 
ter. He had not entered the sea. 
He stood on the sand ... it was 
wet sand . with some of the 
men who shared his fear. He | 
watched me with eyes that knew 
I had learned something whleH 
was denied to him. I had become 
a sea' creatme and I frightened 
him. The sea healed me of the 
Jihad and I think he saw this.” 
Scytale realized that somewhere 
in this recital the music had stop- 
ped. He found it disturbing that 

GAIAXY 



he could not place the instant 
when the baliset had fallen si- 
lent. 

As though it were relevant to 
what he’d been recounting, Farok 
said: “Every gate is guarded. 

There’s no way into the Em- 
peror’s fortress.” 

“That’s its weakness,” Scytale 
said. 

Farok stretched his neck up- 
ward, peering. 

“There’s a way in,” Scytale ex- 
plained. “The fact that most men 
— including, we may hope, the 
Emperor — believe otherwise . 
that’s to our advantage.” He rub- 
bed his lips, feeling the strange- 
ness of the visage he’d chosen. 
The musician’s silence bothered 
him. Did it mean Farok’s son 
was through transmitting? That 
had been the way of it, natural- 
ly: the message condensed and 
transmitted within the music. It 
had been impressed upon Scy- 
tale’s own neural system, there 
to be triggered at the proper 
moment by the distrans imbed- 
ded in his adrenal cortex. If it 
was ended, he had become a con- 
tainer of unknown words. He was 
a vessel sloshing with data: ev- 
ery cell of the conspiracy here on 
Arrakis, every name, every con- 
tact phrase — all the vital in- 
formation. 

With this information, they 
could brave Arrakis, capture 
a sandworm, begin the cul- 
DUNE MESSIAH 



ture of melange somewhere 
beyond Muad’dib’s writ. They 
could break the monopoly as they 
broke Muad’dib. They could do 
many things with this informa- 
tion. 

“We have the woman here,” 
Farok said. “Do you wish to see 
her now?” 

“I’ve seen her,” Scsdale said. 
“I’ve studied her with care. 
Where is she.” 

Farok snapped his fingers. 

^^he youth took up his rebeck, 
drew the bow across it. Se- 
muta music wailed from the 
strings. As though' drawn by the 
sound, a young woman in a blue 
robe emerged from a doorway 
behind the musician. Narcotic 
dullness filled her eyes which 
were the total blue of the Ibad. 
She was a Fremen, addicted to the 
spice, and now caught by an off- 
world vice. Her awareness lay 
deep within the semuta, lost 
somewhere and riding the ec- 
stasy of the music. 

“Otheym’s daughter,” Farok 
said. “My son gave her the nar- 
cotic in the hope of winning a 
woman of the People for himself 
despite his blindness. As you can 
see, his victory is empty. Semuta 
has taken what he hoped to 
gain.” 

“Her father doesn’t know?” 
Scytale asked. 

“She doesn’t even know,” 

41 



Farok said. “My son supplies 
false memories with which she 
accoimts to herself for her visits. 
She thinks herself in love with 
him. This is what her family 
believes. They are outraged be- 
cause he is not a complete man, 
but they won’t interfere, of 
course.” 

The music trailed away to si- 
lence. 

At a gesture from the musician, 
the yoimg woman seated herself 
beside him, bent close to l^ten 
as he murmured to her. 

“What will you do with fter?” 
Farok asked. 

Once more, Scytale studied the 
courtyard. “Who else is in this 
house?” he asked. 

“We are all here now,” Farok 
said. “You’ve not told me what 
you’ll do with the woman. It is 
my son who wishes to know.” 

As though about to answer, 
Scytale extended his right arm. 
From the sleeve of his robe, a 
glistening needle darted, imbed- 
ded itself in Farok’s neck. There 
was no outcry, no change of 
posture. Farok would be dead 
in a minute, but he sat unmoving, 
frozen by the dart’s poison. 

Slowly, Scytale climbed to his 
feet, crossed to the blind musician. 
The youth was still murmuring 
to the young woman when the 
dart whipped into him. 

Scytale took the yoimg wom- 
an’s arm, urged her gently to her 
42 



feet, shifted his own appearance 
before she looked at him. She 
came erect, focused on him. 

‘What is it, Farok?” she asked. 

“My son is tired and must 
rest,” Scytale said. “Come. We’ll 
go out the back way.” 

“We Rad such a nice talk,” 
she said. “I think I’ve convinced 
him to get Tleilaxu eyes. It’d 
make a man of him again.” 

“Haven’t I said it many 
times?” Scytale asked, urging her 
into a rear chamber. 

His voice, he noted with pride, 
matched his features precisely. 
It unmistakably was the voice 
of the old Fremen, who certainly 
was dead by this time. 

Scytale sighed. It had been 
done with sympathy, he told 
fjimself, and the victims certainly 
had known their peril Now, the 
yoimg woman would have to be 
given her chance.

— Words of Muad’dib 
by Princess Irulan 

I t was going to be a bad ses- 
sion, this meeting of the Im- 
perial CouncR, Alia realized. She 

GALAXY 





sensed contention gathering force, 
storing up energy — the way 
Irulan refused to look at Chani, 
Stilgar’s nervous shuffling of pa- 
pers, the scowls Paul directed at 
Korba the Qizara. 

She seated herself at the end 
of the golden council table so 
she could look out the balcony 
windows at the dusty light of the 
afternoon. 

Korba, interrupted by her en- 
trance, went on with something 
he’d been saying to Paul. “WKat 
I mean, m’Lord, is that there 
aren’t as many gods as once there 
were.” 

Alia laughed, throwing her 
head back. The movement drop- 
ped the black hood of her aba 
robe. Her features lay exposed — 
blue-in-blue spice eyes, her 
mother’s oval face beneath a cap 
of bronze hair, small nose, mouth’ 
wide and generous. 

Korba’s cheeks went almost the 
color of his orange robe. He glar- 
ed at Alia, an angry gnome, bald 
and fuming. 

“Do you know whafs being 
said about your brother?” he de- 
manded. 

“I know what’s being said 
about your Qizarate,” Alia coun- 
tered. “You're not divines, you 
are god’s spies.” 

Korba glanced at Paul for sup- 
port, said: “We are sent by the 
writ of Muad’dib, that He shall 
know the truth of His people and 
44 



they shall know the truth of 
Him.” 

“Spies,” Alia said. 

Korba pursed his lips in in- 
jured silence. 

Paul looked at his sister, won- 
dering why she provoked Korba. 
Abruptly, he saw that Alia had 
passed into womanhood, beauti- 
ful with’ the first blazing inno- 
cence of youth. He found him- 
self surprised that he hadn’t no- 
ticed it until this moment. She 
was fifteen — almost sixteen, a 
Reverend Mother without moth- 
erhood, virgin priestess, object of 
fearful veneration for the super- 
stitious masses — Alia of the 
Knife. 

“This is not the time or place 
for your sister’s levity,” Irulan 
said. 

Paul ignored her, nodded to 
Korba “The square’s full of 
pilgrims. Go out and lead their 
prayer.” 

“But they expect you, m’Lord,” 
Korba said. 

“Put on your turban,” Paul 
said, “They’ll never know at this 
distance.” 

Irulan smothered irritation at 
being ignored, and watched Kor- 
ba arise to obey. She’d had the 
sudden disquieting thought that 
Edric might not hide her actions 
from Alia. Whai do we really 
know of the sister? she wondered. 

Chani, hands tightly clasped 
in her lap, glanced across the ta- 

GALAXY 



ble at Stilgar, Her uncle, Paul’s 
Minister of State. Did the old 
Fremen naib ever long for the 
simpler life of his desert sietch? 
she wondered. Stilgar’s black hair, 
she noted, had begun to gray at 
the edges, but his eyes beneath 
heavy brows, remained far-see- 
ing. It was the eagle stare of the 
wild, and his beard still carried 
the catchtube indentation of life 
in a stillsuit. 

M ade nervous by Chani’s at- 
tention, Stilgar looked 
arotmd the Council Chamber. 
His gaze fell on the balcony win- 
dow and Korba standing outside, 
Korba raised outstretched arms 
for the benediction, and a trick 
of the afternoon sun cast a red 
halo onto the window behind 
him. For a moment, Stilgar saw 
the Court Qizara as a figure cru- 
cified on a fiery wheel. Korba 
lowered his arms and destroyed 
the illusion, but Stilgar remain- 
ed shaken by it. His thoughts 
went in angry frustration to the 
fawning supplicants waiting in 
the Audience Hall, and to the 
hateful pomp which surrounded 
Muad’dib’s throne. 

Convening with the Emperor, 
one hoped for a fault in him, to 
find mistakes, Stilgar thought. 
He felt this might be sacrilege, 
but wanted it anyway. 

Distant crowd mtirmuring en- 
tered the chamber as Korba re- 
DUNE MESSIAH 



turned. The balcony door tliump- 
ed into its seals behind him, 
shutting off the sound. 

Paul’s gaze followed the Qfizara. 
Korba took his seat at Paul’s 
left, dark features composed, 
eyes glazed by fanaticism. He’d 
enjoyed that moment of religious 
power. 

“The spirit presence has been 
invoked,” he said. 

“Thank the lord for that,” 
Alia said. 

Korba’s lips went white. 

Again, Paul studied his sister, 
wondered at her motives. Her 
innocence masked deception, He 
told himself. She’d come out of 
the same Bene Gesserit breeding 
program as he had. What had 
the kwisatz haderach genetics 
produced in her? There was al- 
ways that mysterious difference: 
she’d been an embryo in the 
womb when her mother had sur- 
vived the raw melange poison. 
Mother and unborn daughter 
had become Reverend Mothers 
simultaneously. But simultaneity 
didn’t carry identity. 

Of the experience. Alia said 
that in one terrif3ong instant she 
had awakened to consciousness, 
her memory absorbing the un- 
counted other-lives which her 
mother was assimilating. 

“I became my mother and all 
the others,” she said. “I was un- 
formed, imbom, but I became 
an old woman then and there.” 

45 



Sensing his thoughts on her, 
Alia smiled at Paul. His expres- 
sion softened. How could any- 
one react to Korba with other 
than cynical humor? he asked 
himself. What is more ridiculous 
than a death commando trans- 
formed into a priest? 

Stilgar tapped his papers. “If 
my liege permits,” he said. “These 
are matters urgent and dire.” 
“The Tupile treaty?” Paul 
asked. 

“The Guild maintains that we 
must sign this treaty without 
knowing the precise location of 
the Tupile Entente,” Stilgar said. 
“They’ve some support from 
Landsraad delegates.” 

“What pressures have you 
brought to bear?” Irulan asked. 

“Those pressures which my 
Emperor has designated for this 
enterprise,” Stilgar said. The 
stiff formality of his reply con- 
tained all his disapproval of the 
Princess Consort. 

“My Lord and husband,” Iru- 
lan said, turning to Paul, forcing 
him to acknowledge her. 



T^mphasizini the titular difter- 
ence in front of Chani, Paul 
thought, is a weakness. In such 
moments, he shared Stilgar’s dis- 
like for Irulan, but sympathy 
tempered his emotions. What was 
Irulan but a Bene Gesserit pawn? 

“Yes?” Paul said. 

Irulan stared at him. “If you 
46 



withheld iheir melange . ” 

Chani shook her head in dis- 
sent. 

“We tread witH caution!,” Paul 
said. “Tupile remains the place 
of sanctuary for defeated Great 
Houses. It symbolizes a last re- 
sort, a final place of safety for 
all our subjects. Exposing the 
sanctuary makes it vulnerable.” 

“If they can hide people they 
can hide other things,” Stilgar 
rumbled. “An army, perhaps, or 
the beginnings of melange culture 
which ...” 

“You don’t back people into 
a corner,” Alia said. “Not if you 
want them to remain peaceful.” 
Ruefully, she saw that she’d 
been drawn into the contention 
which she'd forseen. 

“So we’ve spent ten years of 
negotiation for nothing,” Irulan 
said . 

“None of my brother’s actions 
are for nothing,” Alia said. 

Irulan picked up a scribe, grip- 
ped it with white knuckled in- 
tensity. Paul saw her marshal 
emotional control in the Bene 
Gesserit way: the penetrating in- 
ward stare, deep breathing. He 
could almost hear her repeating 
the litany. Presently, she said: 
“What have we gained?” 

“We’ve kept the Guild off 
balance,” Chani said. 

“We want to avoid a showdown 
confrontation witli our enemies,” 
Alia said. “We have no special 

GALAXY 



desire to kill them. There’s 
enough butchery going on under 
the Atreides baimer.” 

She feels it, too, Paul thought. 
Strange, what a sense of compel- 
ling responsibility they both felt 
for that brawling, idolatrous uni- 
verse with its ecstasies of tran- 
quility and wild motion. Must 
we protect them from themselves? 
he wondered. They play with 
nothingness every moment — 
empty lives, empty words. They 
ask too much of me. His throat 
felt tight and full. How many 
moments would he lose? What 
sons? What dreams? Was it worth 
the price his vision had reveal- 
ed? Who would ask the living 
of some far distant future, who 
would say to them: ‘But Muad- 
’dib, you would not be here.’? 

“Denying them their melange 
would solve nothing,” Chani said. 
“So the Guild’s navigators would 
lose their ability to see into time- 
space. Your sisters of the Bene 
Gesserit would lose their truth- 
sense. Some people might die 
before their time. Communica- 
tion would break down. Who 
would be blamed?” 

“They wouldn’t let it come to 
that,” Irulan said. 

“Wouldn’t they?” Chahi asked. 
“Why not? Who could blame 
the Guild? They be helpless, de- 
monstrably so.” 

“We’ll sign the treaty as it 
stands,” Paul said. 

DUNE MESSIAH 



“M’Lord,” Stilgar said, con- 
centrating on his hands, “there 
is a question in our minds.” 

“Yes?” Paul gave the old Fre- 
men his full attention. 

“You have certain . , . pow- 
ers,” Stilgar said. “Can you not 
locate the Entente despite the 
Guild?” 

Powers! Paul thought. Stilgar 
couldn’t just say: “You're pre- 
scient. Can’t you trace a path in 
the future that leads to Tupile?” 

T)aul looked at the golden sur- 
face of the table. Always the 
same problem: How could he 
express the limits of the inex- 
pressible? Should he speak of 
fragmentation, the natural des- 
tiny of all power? How could 
someone who’d never experienced 
the spice change of prescience 
conceive of an awareness contain- 
ing no localized spacetime, no 
personal image-vector nor asso- 
ciated sensory captives? 

He looked at Alia, found her 
attention on Irulan. Aha sensed 
his movement, glanced at him, 
nodded toward Irulan. Ahhh', 
yes: any answer they gave 

would find its way into one of 
Irulan’s special reports to the 
Bene Gesserit. They never gave 
up seeking an answer to their 
kwisatz haderach. 

Stilgar, though, deserved an 
answer of some kind. For that 
matter, so did Irulan. 

47 



“The uninitiated try to con- 
ceive of prescience as obeying a 
Natural Law,” Paul said. He 
steepled his hands in front of 
him. “But it’d be just as correct 
to say it’s heaven speaking to us, 
that being able to read the future 
is a harmonious act of man’s be- 
ing. In other words, prediction is 
a natural consequence in the wave 
of the present. It wears the guise 
of nature, you see. But such pow- 
ers cannot be used from an atti- 
tude that pre-states aims and pur- 
poses. Does a chip caught in the 
wave say where it’s going? There 
is no cause and effect in the ora- 
cle. Causes become occasions or 
convections and confluences, 
places where the currents meet. 
Accepting prescience, you fill 
your being with concepts repug- 
nant to the intellect. Your intel- 
lectual consciousness, therefore, 
rejects them. In rejecting, intel- 
lect becomes a part of the pro- 
cesses, and is subjugated.” 

“You cannot do it?” Stilgar 
asked. 

“Were I to seek Tupile with 
prescience,” Paul said, speaking 
directly to Irulan, “this might 
hide Tupile.” 

“Chaos!” Irulan protested. “It 
has no . » . no . consistency.” 

“I did say it obeys no Natur- 
al Law,” Paul said. 

“Then there are limits to what 
you can see or do with your 
powers?” Irulan asked. 

48 



Before Paul could answer. Alia 
said: “Dear Irulan, prescience 
has no limits. Not consistent? 
Consistency isn’t a necessary as- 
pect of the universe.” 

“But he said ...” 

“How can my brother give you 
explicit information about the 
limits of something which has no 
limits? The boundaries escape 
the intellect.” 

That was a nasty thing for 
Alia to do, Paul thought. It 
would alarm Irulan, who had 
such a careful consciousness, so 
dependent upon values derived 
from precise limits. His gaze went 
to Korba, who sat in a pose of 
religious reverie — listening with 
the soul. How could the Qizarate 
use this exchange? More religious 
mystery? Something to evoke 
awe? No doubt. 

“Then you’ll sign the treaty 
in its present form?’’ Stilgar 
asked. 

Paul smiled. The issue of the 
oracle, by StUgar’s judgment, had 
been closed. Stilgar aimed only 
at victory, not at discovering 
truth. Peace, justice and a sound 
coinage — these anchored Stil- 
gar’s universe. He wanted some- 
thing visible and real — a sig- 
nature on a treaty. 

“I’ll sign it,” Paul said. 

Qtilgar took up a fresh folder 
“The latest commimication 
from our field commanders in 

GALAXY 



Sector Ixian speaks of agitation 
for a constitution.” The old Fre- 
men glanced at Chani, who shrug- 
ged. 

Irulan, who’d closed her eyes 
and put both hands to her fore- 
head in ronemnonic impress- 
ment, opened her eyes, studied 
Paul intently. 

“The Ixian Confederacy offers 
submission,” Stilgar said, “but 
their negotiators question the 
amount of the Imperial Tax 
which they ...” 

“They want a legal limit to 
my Imperial will,” Paul said. 
“1^0 would govern me, the 
Landsraad or CHOAM?” 

Stilgar removed from the folder 
a note on instroy paper. “One of 
our agents sent this memoran- 
dxim from a caucus of the 
CHOAM minority.” He read the 
cipher in a flat voice: “The 
Throne must be stopped in its 
attempt at a power monopoly. 
We must tell the truth about the 
Atreides, how he maneuvers be- 
hind the triple sham of Landsraad 
legislation, religious sanction and 
bureaucratic efficiency.” He 
pushed the note back into the 
folder. 

“A constitution,” Chanti mur- 
mured. 

Paul glanced at her, back to 
Stilgar. Thus the Jihad falters, 
Paul thought, but not soon 
enough to save me. The thought 
produced emotional tensions. He 
DUNE MESSIAH 



remembered his earliest visions of 
the Jihad-to-be, the terror and re- 
vulsion he’d experienced. Now, 
of course, he knew visions of 
greatest terrors. He had lived 
with the real violence. He had 
seen his Fremen, charged with 
mystical strength, sweep all be- 
fore them in the religious war. 
The Jihad gained a new perspec- 
tive. It was finite, of coiarse, a 
brief spasm when measured 
against eternity, but beyond lay 
horrors to overshadow anything 
in the past. 

All in my name, Paul thought. 

“Perhaps they could be given 
the form of a constitution,” Chani 
suggested. “It needn’t be actual.” 

“Deceit is a tool of statecraft,” 
Irulan agreed. 

“There are limits to power, as 
those who put their hopes in a 
constitution always discover,” 
Paul said. 

Korba straightened from his 
reverent pose. “M’Lord?” 

“Yes?” And Paul thought. 
Here now/ Here’s one who may 
harbor secret sympathses fox an 
imagined rule of Law. 

“We could begin with a reli- 
gious constitution,” Korba said, 
“something fot the faithful 
who ...” 

“No!” Paul snapped. "We will 
make this an Order In Council. 
Are you recording this, Irulan?” 

“Yes, m’Lord,” Irulan said, 
voice Mgid with dislike for the 

49 



medial role he forced upon Her. 

“Constitutions become the ulti- 
mate tyranny,” Paul said. “They 
are oi^anized power on such a 
scale as to be overwBelming. The 
coostitution is social power mo- 
bilised and it has no conscience. 
It can crush the Highest and the 
lowest, removing all dignity and 
individuality. It has an unsta- 
ble balance point and no limita- 
tions. I, however have limita- 
tions. In my desire to provide an 
iiltimate protection for my peo- 
ple, I forbid a constitution. Order 
In Council, this date, etcetera, 
etcetra.” 

‘WSat of the Ixian concern 
about the tax, m’Lord?” Stilgar 
asked. 

■paul forced his attention away 
from the brooding, angry 
look on Korba’s face, said: “You 
Have a proposal, Stil?” 

“Our price to the Gmld for my 
signature on the Tupile treaty,” 
Paul said, “is the submission of 
tKe Ixian Confederacy to our 
tax. The Confederacy cannot 
trade without Guild transport. 
THey'll pay.” 

“Very good, m’Lord.” Stilgar 
produced another folder, cleared 
his tijxoat. “The Qizarate’s report 
on Selusa Secundus. Irulan’s fa- 
ther has been putting his legions 
through landing maneuvers.” 

Irulan found something of in- 
terest in the palm of her left 
50 



hand. A pulse throbbed at Her 
neck. 

“Irulan,” Paul asked, “do you 
persist in arguing that your fa- 
ther’s one legion is noting more 
than a toy?" 

“What could he do with only 
one legion?” she asked. She stared 
at him out of slitted eyes. 

“He could get Hims^ killed,” 
Chani said. 

Paul nodded. “And I’d be 
blamed.” 

“I know a few commanders in 
tfie Jihad,” Alia said, “who’d 
pounce if they learned of this .” 

“But it’s only his police force!” 
Irulan protested. 

“Then they have no need for 
landing maneuvers,” Paul said. 
“I si^gest that your next little 
note to your father contain a 
frank and direct discussion of 
my views about his delicate po- 
sition.” 

She lowered Her gaze. “Yes, 
m’Lord. I hope that will be the 
end of it. My father would make 
a good martyr.” 

“Mmmmmm,” Paul said. “My 
sister wouldn’t send a message 
to those commanders sHe men- 
tioned unless 1 ordered it.” 

“An attack on my father car- 
ries dangers other than the ob- 
vious military ones,” Irulan said. 
“People are beginning to look 
back on his reign with a certain 
nostalgia.” 

“You’ll go too far one day,” 
GALAXY 



Chani said in her deadly serious 
Fremen voice. 

" “Enough!” Paul ordered. 

He weighed Irulan’s revelation 
about public nostalgia — ah, 
now! That had carried a note 
of truth. Once more, Irulan had 
proved her worth, 

“The Bene Gesscrit send a for- 
mal supplication,” Stilgar said, 
presenting another folder. “They 
wish to consult you about the 
preservation of your bloodline.” 
Chani glanced sideways at tfie 
folder as though it contained a 
deadly device. 

“Send the Sisterhood the usual 
excuses,” Paul said. 

“Must we?” Irulan demanded. 
“Perhaps . , , this is the time 
to discuss it,” Chani said, 

Paul shook His Head sfiarply. 
They couldn’t know that this was 
part of the price he had not 
yet decided to pay. 

But Chani wasn’t to be stop- 
ped. “I have been to the prayer 
wall of Stiech* Tabr where I was 
born,” she said. “I have submit- 
ted to doctors. I have knelt in 
tiie desert and sent my thoughts 
into the depths where dwells 
Shai-fiulud. Yet ...” she shrug- 
ged. “ . nothii^ avails.” 
Science and supetstition, all 
have failed her, Paul thou^t. Do 
I fail her, too, by not telling 
her what bearing, an heir to 
House Atreides will precipitate? 
He looked up to find an expres- 
DUNE MESSIAH 



sion of pity in Alia’s eyes. The 
idea of pity from his sister re- 
pelled him. Had she, too, seen 
that terrif 3 ring future? 

“My Lord must know tfie dan- 
gers to His realm when he has no 
heir,” Irulan said, using her Bene 
Gesserit powers of voice with an 
oily persuasiveness. “These things 
are naturally difficult to discuss, 
but they must be brought into 
the open. An Emperor is more 
than a man. His figure leads the 
realm. Should he die without an 
heir, civil strife must follow. As 
you love your people, you can- 
not leave them thus?” 

paul pushed himself away from 
the table, strode to the bal- 
cony windows. A wind was flat- 
tening the smoke of the city’s 
fires out there. The sky present- 
ed a darkening silver-blue soft- 
ened by the evening fall of dust 
from the Shield Wall. He stared 
southward at the escarpment 
which protected his northern 
lands from the coriolis wind, and 
he wondered why his own peace 
of mind could find no such' 
shield. 

The Council sat silently wait- 
ing behind him, aware of how 
close to rage he was. 

Paul sensed time rushing upon 
Him. As I love my people? He 
tried to force himself into a tran- 
quility of many balances where 
he might shape a new future. 

51 




Diseniage ^ . disengage . < i 
disengage, he thought. What 
would happen if he took Chani, 
just picked up and left with her, 
sought sanctuary on Tupile? His 
name would remain behind. The 
Jihad would find new and more 
terrible centers upon which to 
turn. He’d be blamed for that, 
too. He felt suddenly fearful that 
in reaching for any new thing he 
might let fall what was most 
precious, that even the slightest 
noise from him might send the 
universe crashing back, receding 
until he never could recapture 
any piece of it. 

Below him the square Ead be- 
come the setting for a band of 
pilgrims in the green and white 
of the hajj. They wended their 
way like a disjointed snake be- 
hind a striding Arrakeen guide. 
They reminded Paul that his re- 
ception hall would be packed 
with supplicants by now. Pil- 
grims! Their exercise in homeless- 
ness had become a di^usting 
source of wealth for his Imperi- 
um. The Hajj filled the space- 
wa5Ts with reli^ous tramps. They 
came and they came and they 
came. 

How did I set ttis in motion? 
he asked himself. 

It had, of course, set itself m 
motion. It was in the genes wlucK 
might labor for centuries to 
achieve this brief spasm. 

Driven by that deepest reli- 
DUNE MESSIAH 



gious instinct, the people came, 
seeking their resurrection. The 
pilgrimage ended here: “Arra- 
kis, the place of rebirth, the place 
to die.” 

Snide old Fremen said He 
wanted the pilgrims for their wa- 
ter. 

What was it the pilgrims real- 
ly sought? Paul wondered. They 
said they came to a holy place. 
But they must know the uni- 
verse contained no Eden-source, 
no Tupile for the soul. They call- 
ed Arrakis the place of the un- 
known where all m3^teries were 
explained. This was a link be- 
tween their universe and the next. 
And the frightening thing was 
that they appeared to go . away 
satisfied. 

What do they find heze? Paul 
asked himself. 

Often in their religious ecstasy, 
thQr filled the streets with 
screeching like some odd aviary. 
In fact, ffie Fremen called them 
“passage birds.” And the few who 
died here were “winged souls.” 

With a sigh, Paul thought how 
cacH new planet his legions sub- 
jugated opened new sources of 
pilgrims. They came out of gra- 
titude for the “peace of Muad- 
»dib.” 

Everyw/i’ere there is peace, 
Paul thoxi^ht. Everywhere . , 
excepf in the heart of Mua<rdib. 

He felt that some element of 
himself lay immersed in frosty 
53 



fioar-darkness without end. His 
prescient power had tampered 
with the image of the universe 
held by all mankind. He had 
shaken title safe cosmos and 
replaced security with his Ji- 
had. He had out-fought and out- 
thought and out-predicted the 
universe of men, but a certainty 
filled him that this universe still 
eluded him. 

This planet beneath Kim which 
he had commanded be remade 
from desert into a water-rich par- 
adise, it was alive. It had a pulse 
as dynamic as that of any hu- 
man. It fought him, resisted, 
slipped away from his com- 
mands • . • 

A hand crept into Paul’s. He 
looked down to see Chani 
peering up at him, concern in 
her eyes. Those eyes drank him, 
and she whispered : “Please, love, 
do not battle with your ruhself.” 
An out pouring of emotion swept 
upward from her hand, buoye4 

him. 

“Sihaya,” he whispered. 

‘^We must go to the desert 
soon,” she said in a low voice. 

He squeezed her band, released 
it, returned to the table where he 
remained standing. 

Chani took her seat. 

Irulan stared at the papers in 
front of Srilgar, her mouth a ti^t 
line. 

“Irulan proposes herself as 
54 



mother of the Imperial heir,” 
Paul said. He glanced at Chani, 
back to Irulan, who refused to 
meet his gaze. “We all know she 
holds no love for me.” 

Irulan went very stiU. 

“I know the political argu- 
ments,” Paul said. “It’s the hu- 
man arguments which concern 
me. I think if the Princess Con- 
sort were not bound by the com- 
mands of the Bene Gesseiit, if 
she did not seek this out of de- 
sires for personal power, my re- 
action might be very different. 
As matters stand, though, I re- 
ject this proposal.” 

Irulan took a deep, shaky 
breath. 

Paul, resuming Ifis seat, 
diought he had never seen her 
under such poor control. Leaning 
toward her, he said: “Irulan, I 
am truly sorry.” 

She lifted her chin, a look of 
pure fury in her eyes. “I don’t 
want your pity!” she htesed. And 
turning to Stilgar she asked: “Is 
there more that’s urgent and 
dire?’ 

Holding his gaze firmly on 
Paul, Stilgar said: 

“One more matter, m^Lord. 
The Guild again proposes a for- 
mal embassy here on Arrakis.” 
“One of the deep-space kind?” 
Korba asked, his voice full of 
fantastic loathing. 

‘Tresumably,” Stilgar said. 

“A matter to be considered with 
GALAXY 



tile utmost care, m’Lord,” Korba 
warned. “The Council of Naibs 
would not like it, an actual 
Guildman here on Arralds. They 
contaminate the very ground they 
touch.” 

“They live in tanks and don’t 
touch the ground,” Paul said, 
letting his voice reveal irritation, 
“The Naibs might take mat- 
ters into their own hands, m’- 
Lord,” Korba said. 

Paul glared at him. 

“They are Fremen, after all, 
m’Lord,” Korba insisted. *We 
well remember how the Guild 
brought those who oppressed us. 
We have not forgotten the way 
they blackmailed a spice ransom 
from us to keep our secrets from 
our enemies. They drained us 
of every ...” 

‘Enough!” Paul snapped. “Do 
you think 7 have forgotten?” 

As though he had just awak- 
ened to the import of his own 
words, Korba stuttered unintelli- 
gibly. “M’Lord, forgive me. I did 
not mean to imply you are not 
Fremen. I did not ...” 

“They’ll send a Steersman,” 
Paul said. “It isn’t likely a 
Steersman would come here if 
he could see danger in it.” 

Her mouth dry with sudden 
fear, Irulan said: “You’ve . , 
seen a Steersman come here?” 

“Of course I haven’t seen a 
Steersman,” Paul said, mimicing 
her tone. “But I can' see where 
dune MESSIAH 



one’s been and wfiere one’s going. 
Let them send us a Steersman. 
Perhaps I have a use for one.” 
“So ordered,” Stilgar said. 

And Irulan, hiding a smile be- 
Kind her hand, thought: Ifs 
true then. Our Emperor cannot 
see a Steersman. They are mutu- 
elly blind. The conspiracy is 
hidden. 

V 

“Once more the drama begins.” 
— The Emperor Paul Muad- 
’dib on his ascension to 
the Lion Throne 

A lia peered down from her spy 
window into the great recep- 
tion hall to watch the advance 
of the Guild entourage. 

The sharply silver light of noon 
poured through clerestory win- 
dows onto a floor worked in 
green, blue and eggshell tiles to 
simulate a bayou with water 
plants, 

Guildsmen moved across the 
tile pattern like Hunters stalking 
their prey in a strange jui^le. 
They formed a moving design of 
gray robes, black robes, orange 
robes — all arrayed in a decep- ' 
tively random way around the 
transparent tank where the 
Steersman-Ambassador swam in 
his orange gas. The tank slid on 
its supporting field, towed by 
two gray-robed attendants, like 
55 



a rectangular sHip being warped 
into its dock. 

Directly beneath her Paul sat, 
the Lion Throne on its raised 
dais. He wore the new formal 
crown with its fish and fist em- 
blems. The jeweled golden robes 
of state covered his body. The 
shimmering of a personal shield 
surrounded him. Two wngs of 
bodyguards fanned out on both 
sides along the dais and down 
the steps. Stilgar stood two steps 
below on Paul’s right hand in 
a white robe with a yellow rope 
for a belt. 

Sibling empathy told her ^at 
Paul seethed vnth the same agi- 
tation she was experiencing, al- 
though she doubted another could 
detect it. His attention remained 
on an orange-robed attendant 
whose blindly staring metal eyes 
looked neither to right nor left. 
This attendant walked at the 
right front comer of the Ambas- 
sador’s troupe like a military 
outrider. A rather flat face be- 
neath curly black hair, such of 
his figure as could be seen be- 
neath the orange robe, every ges- 
ture shouted a familiar identity. 

It was Dimcan Idaho. 

It could not be Duncan Idaho, 
yet it was. 

Captive memories absorbed 
in the womb during the moment 
of her mother’s spice change 
identified this man for Alia by 
a Rihani decipherment which cut 
56 



through' all camouflage. Paul was 
seeing him, she knew, out of 
countless personal expenencca, 
out of gratitudes and youthful 
sharing. 

It was Duncan. 

Alia shuddered. There could 
be only one answer; this was a 
Tleilaxu ghola, a being recon- 
structed from the dead flesh of 
the original. That original had 
perished saving Paul. This could 
only be a product of the axlotl 
tanks. 

The ^o/a walked with the 
cock-footed alertness of a master 
swordsman. He came to a halt 
as the Ambassador’s tank glided 
to a stop ten paces from the steps 
of the dais. 

In tlie Bene Gesserit way ^e 
could not escape, Alia read Paul’s 
.disquiet. He no longer looked at 
the figure out of his past. Not 
looking, his whole being star^. 
Muscles strained against restric- 
tions as he nodded to the Guild 
Ambassador and said : *^I am 
told your name is Edric. We wel- 
come you to our Court in the 
hope this will bring new under- 
standing between us.” 

The Steersman assumed a sy- 
baritic reclining pose in his or- 
ange gas, popped a melange cap- 
sule into his mouth before meet- 
ing Paul’s gaze. The tiny trans- 
ducer orbiting a comer of the 
Guildsman’s tank reproduced a 
coughing sound, then tiie rasp- 
GAIAXY 



ing, uninvolved voice: “I abase 
myself before my Emperor and 
beg leave to present my creden- 
tials and offer a small gift” 

A n aide passed a scroll up to 
Stilgar, who studied it, scowl- 
ing, then nodded to Paul. Both 
Stilgar and Paul turned then to- 
ward the ^hola. 

“Indeed, my Emperor has dis- 
cerned the gift.” Edric said. 

“We are pleased to accept your 
credentials,” Paul said. “Explain 
the gift” 

Edric rolled in the tank, bring- 
ing his attention to bear on the 
ghola. “This is a man called 
Hayt.” he said, spelling the name. 
“According to our investigators, 
he has a most curious history. 
He was killed here on Arrakis . 
8 grievous head wound which re- 
quired many months of regrowth. 
The body was sold to the Bene 
Tleilax as that of a master 
swordsman, an adept of the Gi- 
naz School. It came to om at- 
tention that this must be Dun- 
can Idaho, the trusted retainer 
of your household. We bou^t 
him as a gift befitting an Emper- 
or.” Edric peered up at Paul. 
“Is it not Idaho, Sire?” 
Restraint and caution gripped 
Paul’s voice. “He has the aspect 
of Idaho.” 

Does Paul see something, I 
don't? Alia wondered. No! Ifs 
Duncan! 

DUNE MESSIAH 



The man called Hayt stood im- 
passively, metal eyes fixed 
straight ahead, body relaxed. No 
sign escaped him to indicate he 
knew Himself to be the object 
of discussion. 

“According to our best knowl- 
edge, it’s Idaho,” Edric said. 

“He’s called Hayt now,” Paul 
said. “A curious name.” 

“Sire, there’s no divining how 
or why the Tleilaxu bestow 
names,” Edric said. “But the 
names can be changed. The Tlei- 
laxu name is of little importance.” 

This is a Tleilaxu thing, Paul 
thought. There's the problem. 
The Bene Tleilax held little at- 
tachment to phenomenal nature. 
Good and evil carried strange 
meanings in their philosophy. 
What might they have incorpor- 
ated in Idaho’s flesh — out of 
design or whim? 

Paul glanced at Stilgar, noted 
the Fremen’s superstitious awe. 
It was an emotion echoed all 
through his Fremen guard. Stil- 
gar’s mind would be speculating 
about the loafiisome habits of 
Guildsmen, of Tleilaxu and of 
gholas. 

Turning toward the ghola, 
Paul said: “Hayt, is that your 
only name?” 

A serene smile spread over 
the ghola's dark features. The 
metal eyes lifted, centered on 
Paul, but maintained their me- 
chanical stare. “That is how I 
57 



ami called, my Lord: Hayt” 
In her dark spy hole, Alia 
trembled. It was Idaho’s voice, 
a quality of soimd so precise she 
sensed its imprint upon her cells. 

“May it please my Lord,” Ihe 
ghola added, “if I say his voice 
^ves me pleasure. This is a sign, 
say the Bene TIeilax, that I have 
heard the voice . before.” 

“But you don’t know this for 
sure,” Paul said. 

“I know nothing of my past for 
sure, my Lord. It was explained 
that I can have no memory of 
my former life. All that remains 
from before is the pattern set 
by the genes. There are, however, 
niches into which once-familiar 
things may fit There are voices, 
places, foods, faces, sounds, ac- 
tions — a sword in my hand, the 
controls of a ’thopter ...” 
Noting how intently the Guild- 
men watched this exchange, Paul 
asked: “Do you understand that 
you’re a gift?” 

“It was explained to me, my 
Lord.” 

Paul sat back, hands resting on 
the arms of the throne. 

F haf debt do I owe Duncan's 
flesh? he wondered. The 
man died saving my life. But 
this is not Idaho, this is a ghola. 
Yet, here were body and mind 
which had taught Paul to fly a 
•thopter as though the wings grew 
from his own shoulders. Paul 
58 



knew he could not pick up a 
sword without leaning on the 
harsh education Idaho had given 
him. A ghola. This was flesh 
f\ill of false impressions, easily 
misread. Old associations would 
persist. Duncan Idaho. It wasn’t 
so much a mask the ghola wore 
as it was a loose, concealing gar- 
ment of personality which moved 
in a way different from whatever 
the Tleilaxu had hidden there. 

“How might you serve us?” 
Paul asked, 

“In any way my Lord’s vnsHes 
and my capabilities agree.” 

Alia, watching from her van- 
tage point, was touched by the 
ghola's air of diffidence. She de- 
tected nothing feigned. Some- 
thing xiltimately innocent shone 
from the new Duncan Idaho. The 
original had been worldly, devil- 
may-care. But this flesh had been 
cleansed of all that. It was a 
pure surface upon which the 
Tleilaxu had written . what? 

She sensed the hidden perils in 
this gift then. This was a Tlei- 
laxu thing. The Tleilaxu display- 
ed a disturbing lack of inhibitions 
in what they created. Unbridled 
curiosity might guide their ac- 
tions. They boasted they could 
make anything from the proper 
raw material — devils or saints. 
They sold killer-mentats. They’d 
produced a killer medic, over- 
coming the Suk inhibitions 
against the taking of human life 
GALAXY 



to do it. Thar wares included 
willing menials, pliant sex toys 
for any whim, soldiers, generals, 
philosophers, even an occasional 
moralist. 

Paul stirred, looked at Edric. 
*TIow has this gift been trained?” 
He asked. 

“If it please lay Lord,” E^dric 
said, “it amused the Tleilaxu to 
train this ghola as a mentat 
and a philosopher of the Zensun- 
ni. Thus, they sought to increase 
his abilities with the sword.” 
‘T)id they succeed?” 

“I do not know, my Lord.” 
Paul weighed the answer. 
Truthsense told him Edric sin- 
cerely believed the ghola to be 
Idaho. But there was more. The 
waters of Time through which 
this oracular Steersman moved 
suggested dangers without re- 
vealing them. Hayt. The Tlei- 
laxu name spoke of peril. Paul 
felt him self tempted to reject the 
^t. Even as he felt the tempta- 
tion, he knew he couldn’t choose 
that way. This flesh made de- 
mands on House Atreides — a 
fact the enemy well knew. 

“Zensunni philosopher,” Paul 
mused, once more looking at the 
ghola. “You’re examined your 
own role and motives?” 

“I approach my service in an 
attitude of humility. Sire. I am 
a cleansed mind washed free of 
the imperatives from my human 
past.” 

DUNE MESSIAH 



“Would you prefer we called 
you Hayt or Duncan Idaho?” 
“My Lord may call me what 
Ee wishes, for I am not a name.” 
“But do you enjoy the name 
Duncan Id^o?” 

“I think that was my' name, 
Sire. It fits within me. Yet . , . 
it stirs up curious responses. One’s 
name, I think, must carry much 
that’s unpleasant aloi^ with the 
pleasant.” 

“What gives you tfie most 
pleasure?” Paul asked. 

Unexpectedly, the ghola laugh- 
ed and said: “Looking for signs 
in others which reveal my former 
self.” 

“Do you see such signs Here?” 
“Oh, yes, my Lord. Your man 
Stilgar there is caught between 
suspicion and admiration. He was 
friend to my former self, but tibfe 
ghola flesh repels Him. You, ray 
Lord, admired the man I was . 
and you trusted him .” 

“Cleansed mind,” Paid said. 
“How can a cleansed mind put 
itself in bondage to us?” 

“Bondage, my Lord? THe 
cleansed mind makes decisions in 
the presence of unknowns and 
without cause and effect. Is this 
bondage?” 

T)aul scowled. It was a Zta- 
sunni saying, cryptic, apt — 
immersed in a creed which de- 
nied objective fimction in all 
mental activity. Without ceuee 
S9 



and effect! Such thoughts shock- 
ed the mind. Unknowns? Un- 
knowns lay in every decision, 
even in the oracular vision. 

“You’d prefer we called you 
Duncan Idaho?” Paul asked. 

“We live by differences, my 
Lord. Choose a name for me.” 
“Let your Tleilaxu name 
stand,” Paul said. “Hayt — there 
is a name that inspires caution.” 
Hayt bowed, moved back one 
step. 

And Alia wondered; How did 
he know the interview was over? 
I knew it because I know my 
brother. But there was no sign 
a stranger could read. Did the 
Duncan Idaho in him know? 

Paul turned toward the Am- 
bassador, said; “Quarters have 
been set aside for your embassy. 
It is our desire to haw a pri- 
vate consultation with you at 
the earliest opportunity. We will 
send for you. Let us inform you 
further, before you hear it from 
an inaccurate source, that a Rev- 
erend Mother of the Sisterhood, 
Gaius Helen Mohiam, has been 
removed from the heighliner 
which brought you. It was done 
at our command. Her presence 
on your ship will be an item in 
our talks.” 

A wave of Paul’s left hand 
dismissed the envoy. “Hayt,” 
Paul said, “stay here.” 

The Ambassador’s attendants 
backed away towing the tank. 
60 



Edric became orange motion in 
orange gas — eyes, a mouth, 
gently waving limbs. 

Paul watched until the last 
Guildsman was gone, the great 
doors swinging close behind them. 

7’ve done it now, Paul thought. 
JVe accepted the ghola. The 
Tleilaxu creation was bait, no 
doubt of it. Very likely the old 
hag of a Reverend Mother played 
the same role. But it was the 
time of the tarot which he’d fore- 
cast in an early vision. The dam- 
nable tarot! It muddied the wa- 
ters of Time imtil the prescient 
strained to detect moments but 
an hour off. Many a fish took the 
bait and escaped, he reminded 
himself. And the tarot worked 
for him as well as against him. 
What he could not see, others 
might not detect as well. 

The ghola stood, head cocked 
to one side, waiting. 

Stilgar moved across the steps, 
Hid the ghola from Paul’s view. 
In Chakobsa, the Hunting lan- 
guage of their sietch days, Stil- 
gar said: “That creature in the 
tank gives me the shudders, Sire, 
but this gift! Send it away!” 

In the same tongue, Paul said; 
“I cannot.” 

“Idaho’s dead,” Stilgar argued. 
“This isn’t Idaho. Let me take 
its water for the tribe.” 

“The ghola is my problem, Stil. 
Your problem is our prisoner. I 
want the Reverend Mother 
GALAXY 



guarded m<»t carefully by the 
men I trained to resist the wiles 
of Voice.” 

“I like this not, Sire.” 

*T’ll be cautious, Stil. See that 
you are, too.” 

“Very well, Sire.” Stilgar step- 
ped down to the floor of the 
hall, passed close to Ha 5 rt, sniffed 
hun and strode out. 

Evil can be detected by its 
ftnell, Paul thought Stilgar 
bad planted the green and white 
Atreides banner on a dozen 
worlds, but remained supersti- 
tious Fremen, proof against any 
sophistication. 

Paul studied tiie gift 

“Duncan, Duncan,” he whis- 
pered. “what have they done to 
you?” 

“They gave me Kfe, m'Lord,” 
Hayt said. 

“But why were you trained 
and given to us?” Paul asked. 

Hayt pursed his lips, then: 
“They intend me to destroy you.” 

T he statement’s candor shook 
Paul. But then, how else 
could a Zensunni-mentat re- 
spond? Even in a ghola, a men- 
tat could speak no less than the 
truth, especially out of Zensunni 
inner calm. This was a human 
computer, mind and nervous sys- 
tem fitted to the tasks relegated 
long ago to hated mechanical de- 
vices. To condition him also as 
a Zensunni meant a double ra- 
DUNE MESSIAH 



tion of honesty . unless the 
Tleilaxu had built somefiting 
even more odd into this flesh. 

Why, for example, fee me- 
chanical eyes? Tleilaxu boasted 
tiieir metal eyes improved on fee 
original. Strange then, feat more 
Tleilaxu didn’t wear them out of 
choice. 

Paul glanced up at AUa’s spy 
hole, longed for her presence 
and advice, for counsel not cloud- 
ed by feelings of rcsponalbllity 
and debt. 

Once more, Ee looked at fee 
ghola. This was no frivolous gift. 
It gave honest answers to dan- 
gerous questions. 

It makes no diilerence that I 
know this is a weapon to be need 
against me, Paul thought. 

“What should I do to pro- 
tect mysdf from you?” Paul 
asked. It was direct speech, no 
royal “we,” but a question as he 
might have put it to fee old 
Duncan Idaho. 

“Send me away, mT-oni” 
Paul shook his head from 
side to side. “How are you to 
destroy me?” 

Hayt looked at fee giMuds, 
who’d moved closer to Paul after 
Stilgaris departure. He turned, 
cast his glance around the hall, 
brought his metal eyes back to 
bear on Paul, nodded. 

“This is a place where a n^n 
draws away from people,” Hayt 
said. “It speaks of such power 
61 



that one can contemplate it com- 
fortably only in the remembrance 
that all things are finite. Did my 
Lord’s oracular powers plot his 
course into this place?” 

Paul drummed his fingers 
against the throne’s arms. The 
mentat sought data, but the 
question disturbed him. ‘T came 
to thk position by strong deci- 
sion . not always out of my 
other . abilities.” 

“Strong decisions,” Hayt said. 
“These temper a man’s life. One 
can take the temper from fine 
metal by Keating it and allow- 
ing it to cool without quenching.” 
“Do you divert me with Zen- 
sunni prattle?” Paul asked. 

“Zensunni has other avenues 
to explore, Sire, than diversion 
and display.” 

Paul wet his lips with his 
tongue, drew in a deep breath, 
set his own thoughts into the 
counterbalance poise of the men- 
tat. Negative answers arose 
around him. It wasn’t expected 
that he’d go haring after the 
ghola to the exclusion of other 
duties. No, that wasn’t it Why a 
Zensonni-m e n t a t? Philosophy 
. words . contemplation . 
inward searciung . He felt the 
weakness of His data. 

“We need more data,” he mut- 
tered. 

“The facts needed by a mentat 
do not brush off onto one as you 
might gather pollen on your robe 
62 



while passing through a field of 
flowers,” Hajrt said. “One chooses 
his pollen carefully, examines it 
xmder powerful amplification.” 

“You must teach me this Zen- 
sunni way with rhetoric,” Paul 
said. 

The metallic eyes gfittered at 
him for a moment then: “M’- 
Lord, i>erhaps that’s what was 
intended.” 

To bkmt my will wiift words 
and ideas.^ Paul wondered. 

“Ideas are most to be feared 
when they become actions,” 
Paul said. 

“Send me away, Sire,” Hajrt 
said, and it was Duncan Idaho’s 
voice full of concern for the 
young master. 

Paul felt trapped by that voice. 
He couldn’t send that voice away, 
even when it came from a gho/a. 
“You will stay,” he said, “and 
we’ll both exercise caution.” 

Hayt bowed in submission. 

P aul glanced up at the spy hole, 
eyes pleading for Alia to take 
this iift off his hands and ferret 
out its secrets. Gbolas were 
^osts to frighten children. He’d 
never thought to know one. To 
know this one, he had to set him- 
self above all compassion . 
and he wasn’t certain he could 
do it. Duncan . Duncan . 
Where was Idaho in this shaped- 
to-measure flesh? It wasn’t flesh 
... it was a shroud in fleshly 
GALAXY 



shape. Idaho lay dead forever on 
the floor of an Arrakeen cavern. 
His ghost stared out of metal 
eyes. Two beings stood side by 
side in this revenant flesh. One 
was a threat with its force and 
and nature hidden behind unique 
veils. 

Closing his eyes, Paul allowed 
old visions to sift through his 
awareness. He sensed the spirits 
of old love and hate spouting 
there in a rolling sea from which 
no rock lifted above the chaos. 
No place at all from which to 
survey turmoil. 

Why has no vision shown me 
this new Duncan Idaho? he asked 
himsdf. What concealed Time 
from an oracle? Other oracles, 
obviously. 

Paul opened his eyes, asked: 
“Ha3rt, do you have the power of 
prescience?” 

“No, m’Lord.” 

Sincerity spoke in that voice. 
It was possible the ghola didn’t 
know he possessed this ability, 
of course. But thafd hamper 
his working as a mentat. What 
was the hidden design? 

Old visions surged aroimd 
Paul. Would he have to choose 
the terrible way? Distorted Time 
hinted at this ghola in that hide- 
ous future. Would that way close 
in upon no matter what he 
did? 

Disengaie . disengage . 
disenga^ . 

DUNE MESSIAH 



The thought tolled in hte mind. 

In her position above P&ul, 
Alia sat with chin cupped in 
left band, stared down at the 
ghola. A magnetic attraction 
about this Hayt reached her. 
Tleilaxu restoration had ^ven 
him youtii, an irmocent intensity 
which called out to her. She’d 
understood Paul’s unspoken plea. 
When oracles failed, one turned 
to real spies and physical powers. 
She wondered, though, at her own 
eagerness to accept tins challenge. 
She felt a positive desire to be 
near this new man, perhaps to 
touch him. 

He’s a danger to hoilk of us, 
she thought.

baffling — and terribly dangerous I 



S enator Clint of California fol- 
lowed his intense young 
guide out of the underground pre- 
fab bunker. 

“AH clear, sir,” the guard told 
him. “For a little while, at least.” 
The senator exhaled a deep 
breath. “No wonder I Had a Hard 
time forcing this trip. Washing- 
ton probably had my safety in 
imind.” But then he frowned. 
“Among other things.” 

“At that,” the guide said, “you 
must move a lot of air, sir. You 
are the first official here in Bur- 
ma in years.” He coughed. “UH— 
you’ve had similar answers from 
all of the ten you’ve questioned, 
so far. So why bother any more 
of these kids?” 



Clint stared at such impudence. 
To a United States senator. From 
a kid of maybe twenty calling 
others kids. 

“I haven’t undertaken this dan- 
gerous mission merely to ‘both- 
er’ anyone,” he answered coldly. 
He halted his steps brusquely — 
and thereby forced the guide to 
stop. “I’ll question this young 
man,” he said decisively. 

The yoimg man he indicated 
was cleaning a carbine. The guide 
wet Bis lips and said nothir^. The 
senator asked lus usual question. 

“What’s your opinion of this 
conflict you’re in? I am Senator 
Clint of Califoituia.” 

The boy looked into the dis- 
tance, as if shy at meeting a Sen- 



ator. “I’ve tBought it all out my- 
self,” he said, “and if they are 
to be stopped, tEs is the place. 
Neo-colonialism must not be al- 
lowed to make slaves of all meru 
This terror has to be kept from 
engulfing the world.” 

“Thank you,” Clint said. 
He moved on then, his suspi- 
cion additionally confirmed, the 
suspicion that had made him risk 
his life getting into this sub-ra- 
diation zone. Keeping his head 
down as directed by the guide, he 
crept to the other side of the shel- 
ter, where a boy was leaning on 
a bunker, his face knotted in ap- 
parent confusion. 

Clint thought of speaking, but 
the guide tugged gently at his 
sleeve and motioned him away. 

The senator didn’t object this 
time, not being sure if he should 
have spoken to the boy. “He did 
not seem busy,” he said. “Just 
seemed to be mulling over some- 
thing as if puzzled or confused.” 
“Confused is the word all right, 
Senator. He’s due in.” 

“Battle fatigue?” 

“You could say that Yes.” 
“Might help if I visit him in 
the hospital.” The senator knew 
how far that would get, having 
tried to visit service hospitals 
back home. 

“They don’t allow tHat.” The 
guide was being impudently sharp 
again. “Question this one.” It 
was almost an order. 

FULL COMMITMENT 



Clint wasted no further words 
on the sick boy, but turned to 
the one indicated. “Why are you 
here?” he asked. “I’m Senator 
Clint.” 

“I’ve given it a lot of thought,” 
die baby face said. “And if the 
march of imperialism is to be 
baited, I have to help. These 
slave-masters must no^" be allow- 
ed to dominate mankind. TMs 
terror must be stopped here in 
Southeast Asia or it will engulf 
the world surely in a tide of evil 
captialist imperialism.” 

“Thank you,” Clint said. 

He turned away from the boy, 
and spoke to his guide. “I’ve seen 
and heard all I need. Now about 
getting out of this hellfire?” 
“Good idea, Senator, for your 
own safety,” the guide said. 
“First, though, the tape.” 

Clint thought his slight tape- 
control motions had been unde- 
tected. The guide hadn’t given a 
sign he noticed. 

“It’s my property, ” he sold. 
“Care to stay here in Burma 
with it?” the guide said. “Or 
leave without it?” 

There was no "sir,” end ^Scre 
was an ominoiu frown. 

Clint took the recorder from 
his cigarette package and handed 
it over.

a cab to the downtown in-

line there queued halfway up the 
block and straggled around the 
comer. He could peer inade tiie 
building and see ^e room filled 
with young men moving first to- 
ward a desk, theii singly into a 
rear room, tKe door of wEcH w^ 
guarded by two grim men with 
machine-guns. 

‘‘Excuse me,” fie said to the 
young man first iu line. A boy 
of perhaps fourteen. He thought 
here lie would get less abashed 
answers if fie did not identify 
himself. “If you don’t mind ^ 
what is yaur reason for going in- 
to the service?” 

“They tapped me,” the boy 
said, seeming almost cynical. 

‘‘How about you?” he asked tlie 
boy next in line. 

“I kicked and I screamed,” the 
boy said. “But they still said I 
had to fi^t." 

No one smiled. 

TKe senator moved to the next 
boy. 

“What can I do?” the boy said 
without being asked. “Go to 
gail?” 

“Thanks, boys,” Clint said, 
and turned toward the building. 

“I am Senator Clint,” he said 
to the rocky-jawed sergeant at 
the desk. 

TKe se^eant stood, nodded, 
smiled. He was not surprised, or 
if fie was, fie Hid it well. “An Hon- 
or, rir.” 

Had word gone ahead of him? 
66 



Clint wondered. He felt they ex- 
pected bini. And he wanted to 
see bdiind that guarded door. 

“I know you won’t mind,” he 
said, “if I speak to some of the 
new recruits after you talk to 
them?” 

The sergeant widened his smile. 
“Sorry, Senator,” He spread a 
hand apologetically. “Regula- 
tions, you know. Red tape keep^ 
our hands tied. No one is allow- 
ed to talk to a man after he pass- 
es this desk.” He added: “We 
don’t like the rule either, ” after 
looking directly into the senator’s 
glaring eyes. 

“Where do they go from here?” 
“From here? After a complete 
pHysical here, to a service Hospi- 
tal for any minor tfiing. Maybe a 
tootfi filled — or some may even 
need a major operation.” 

“Well, thanks. Sergeant, for the 
courtesy,” tKe senator said, and 
left the stUl-smiling sergeant 
He took another cab to his 
fiome in Beverly Hills. His wife 
was out. He Kad not wired her, 
for a purpose. Senator Clint 
started a search for a once-dis- 
carded but now predous and 
rare paperback book. A curiosity 
he just didn’t believe wfien he 
had found it. A fantasy of a type 
once written, now frowned upon 
— but this one Kad not been rep- 
resented as a fantasy, but as fac- 
tual. 

There are different ways of 
GALAXY 



changing history. One is by ef- 
fecting change, and so making 
history; another is by changing 
history after it happens. To do 
the latter, a government must call 
in from time to time any book 
which contradicts tiie newer truth. 
Once gold had been called in 
when the government dedded pri- 
vate possession of the metal was 
against the public interest. 

Another time, books. Of course, 
i«placements were issued, and 
holders of valid receipts were re- 
imbursed in kind on a one-to-one 
basis. 

Finding the paperback finally, 
Senator Clint flew back to Wash- 
ington, leaving only a scribbled 
note for his wife. 

I n the cloakroom of tfie Senate 
he collared McAdam of Illi- 
nois, one man the years of inti- 
macy had shown he could trust. 
“Let’s take a stroll before break- 
fast,” he said to McAdam quietly. 

Three blocks from the Capitol 
the two exchanged glances. Safe. 
Without a word both turned on 
their transistor radios, and turn- 
ed up the volume. 

“Now,” Clint said. “I'm going 
to drop a bomb today, on the 
Senate floor. 

“Were you inside a service 
hospital?” 

Clint shook his head. “I tried. 
You just don’t get in — senator 
or no. He turned up the transistor

again. “That — ^that ‘cloak’ I 

mentioned?” 

“Oh, yes.” McAdam nodded 
tinderstanding of their code word. 

“I’ve found it. We did start to 
fight against communism, just 
as I remembered reading. But 
somewhere back there Russia and 
the others realized they had fail- 
ed, and they adopted capitalism. 
But they had undermined us from 
within — and we traded sys-

THE CITY 
THAT WAS 
THE WORTH 




lllusrated by ADKINS 



From his mite-high fewer 
in the mile-high city, 

John Hillary Dane saw a future 
he hoped would never be. 



I 

V Tobody but John Hillary Dane 
would even have considered 
trying to build a major conserva- 
tory in the snow-rimmed crater 
of Coropuna, and nobody — un- 
less you counted a government as 
somebody — but Dane could ac- 
tually have done it. 

The next question was "Why?” 



But Toby Walker had asked 
himself that question about Dane 
hundreds of tim^ since they had 
met, the first night of their fresh- 
man year in college, without get- 
ting more than ten or a dozen 
satisfactory answers. Even those 
few had been enough for Toby’s 
newspaper to make Dane Toby’s 
intermittently permanent assign- 
ment. 



69 



The paper had been only mild- 
ly disappointed at Toby’s failure 
to get any answer to his last 
such question; Why had Dane 
put up an office building in Den- 
ver one mile hi^h? One answer 
out of twenty-five from Dane 
was the highest score of any jour- 
nalist in the world, and they 
knew it. 

Only this consideration, whidi 
Toby knew as well as his em- 
ployers, prevented him from con- 
sidering the presait segment of 
his assignment as a sort of pun- 
ishment Coropuna has few com- 
petitors as one of the Godfor- 
saken spots in Peru. 

Just getting a look at the ex- 
tinct volcano bad been difficult 
enou^ It lies well more than 
14® south of the equator, where 
most of the country consists of 
an altiplano, or puna, a basin 
about twelve thousand feet higlu 
which is overshadowed on both 
sides by the two ranges of the 
Cordillera de los Andes. To get 
to tlie puna, you first had to 
cross the Cordillera Real (by 
plane, there was no other way). 
You then found yourself looking 
across tiny Indian fields to a 
salt swamp, far south of which 
glittered the northernmost reach 
of Lake Titicaca; on the other 
side of that, a grassy, uninhab- 
ited plain which ended in a tre- 
mendous plateau of ancient lava. 
From this hwixon the volcaiuc 
70 



cones of the Cordillera Occiden- 
tal broke into the sky witli the 
isolated ^olence of gunshots. 

And the king of these was Coro- 
puna, 21,700 feet high, the second- 
highest peak in Peru. The orig- 
inal estimate for building Dane 
ObsCTvatory in such a spot had 
been thirty milli on dollars: half 
of it for a 200-inch telescope, 
five million more for a 1000-indi 
radio telescope, another two mil- 
lion for buildings and instrumen- 
tation, and all the rest for trans- 
portation. Everything had to 
come in by air as far as the puna. 
From there to the ce/a or eye- 
brow of Coropuna, Dane had 
built a single-track cogwheel 
railroad; from the ce/a to the cra- 
ter, everything went by human 
hand and back, brick by brick, 
girder by girder. 

Dane had already spent the 
thirty million, plus five million 
more contributed by the Ford 
Foundation, and still the thing 
wasn’t done. He had started on 
it in 1986, and that had been 
ten years ago. 

T he mile-high sk 3 rscraper had 
gone up in the meantime. 
There was one thing about John 
Hillary Dane that was no secret : 
he was the richest man not only 
in the world, but in all of his- 
tory. 

Toby had already asked all tiie 
usual journalistic “wh 3 ^” and 
GALAXY 



been answered readily. He al- 
ready knew why a 200-inch opti- 
cal telescope was desirable in the 
Southern Hemisphere; the skies 
down there offer a multitude of 
relatively neglected objects, in- 
cluding the Magellanic Clouds, 
the nearest galaxies to our own, 
and Shapely Center, the heart of 
our own galaxy. 

Wdl, but in that case, wouldn’t 
Chile have been still better, be- 
cause fartiier soutii? Certainly, 
but the Peruvian government had 
put up fewer roadblocks. All 
right, then why the second high- 
est peak in Peru — why not 
Huascaran? Many reasons: Hu- 
ascaran is less than a thousand 
feet higher, it’s six degrees fur- 
tiier north, and Ihe only manpow- 
er available around it is a few 
Indians living in burrows like 
animals; but above all, Coro- 
puna is topped by a crater, where- 
as Huascaran has a peak like a 
convention of machetes. Could 
not you have blown the top off 
it? No, because the United States 
has treaty obligations against 
giving me any bomb for the 
purpose, and the Peruvians 
would have understandable ob- 
jections to such an explosion 
within their borders; anyhow, all 
the other objections to Huascar- 
an still stand. But aren’t there 
a lot of earthquakes in the Coro- 
puna area? Yes, but we’re build- 
ing for them. 

THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



All of these answers would not 
satisfy Tobjr’s editors, because 
Dane would give them to anyone 
who asked. The real, the essen- 
tial question was: Why was 
Dane, who as an instrument- 
maker qualified as a sort of phys- 
icist who previously had been in- 
nocent of any interest in as- 
tronomy, committing such a vast 
philanthropy? 

Dane would not answer that 
one. Toby had some knowledge 
of the man’s personal life which 
had led him to some guesses, but 
all they added up to was parlor 
psychoanalysis •— certainly notH- 
ing he would even consider print- 
ing. His newspaper was not that 
kind of newspaper; Toby was not 
that kin d of a reporter, and above 
all, Dane was a friend of his. 

For Dane, time was the eviL 
Time present, time past, time 
to come; Time is. Time was. 
Time is past! Nothing that fie 
did gave reason to what he was 
but this; at his heart’s core was 
the word, tolling like a bell. Time, 
Time, Time! 

And yet every man knows, as 
one unregretful poet said, tfiat 
Time is the bridge that bums be- 
hind us. Why was Dane, who was 
so powerful, and by all ordinary 
standards so free, so desperate 
to revise the ages, and even tiie 
fleeing minutes? 

And why, for that matter, did 
he have to build physical bridges 
71 



from one second to anotlier? 

Toby was not to learn, the an- 
swer to that question for twen- 
ty years, and even tben, not the 
v^ole answer — not even Dane 
ever learned that. Nevertheless, 
die burden of knowledge — and 
not only about Dane — that the 
observatory in Coropuna was to 
bring him was very nearly more 
than he could bear. 

II 

T hey were standing at the mo- 
ment on the platform which 
would eventually bear the radio 
telescope, both of them heavily 
clad in furs and wearing oxygen 
masks. The air was so thin that it 
would not carry sound any use- 
ful distance; Toby had a button 
in his ear, a mike at his mouth. 

The crumbling rim of the cra- 
ter, much eroded but with the 
raggedness of ite outline soften- 
ed by permanent snow, was their 
horizon. Some distance away, the 
completed dome of the optical 
observatory, in which the great 
mirror had already been install- 
ed and was being cooled degree 
by degree, at about half a degree 
a day, toward the permanent 
temperature of the crater, frown- 
ed down upon them. Behind it 
and to the right was the solar 
observatory, atop a hundred-foot 
tower in order to dear the cra- 
ter ramparts. 

72 



The radio telescope thus far con- 
sisted of the circular metal plat- 
form, like that for some unima- 
ginably huge anti-aircraft gun, 
which in turn was encircled by a 
railroad track. On the track were 
two flatcars, 180® apart from 
eadi other and connected by a 
cantilever bridge which was to 
bear the trunnions (bought at 
surplus from a mothballed Ar- 
gentinian battleship; no part of 
the cost of Dane Observatory 
was waste) which eventually 
would support the 1000-inch dish 
of the telescope itself. 

The bridge was still under 
construction and in fact was 
only provisionally moored on 
one of the two flatcars; exact, 
non-warping alignment was es- 
sential and couldn’t be made sure 
of until more of the final load, 
or a test version of it, had been 
put on the structure. Five men 
were aloft on it, with torches — 
one Northerner and four Indians. 
Thick black power cables ran 
back and forth across the plat- 
form, like a nest of copulating 
snakes. 

The simile was not brilliantly 
original, but as a journalist Toby 
was not accustomed to pausing 
to search for the mot juste. Be- 
sides, one of the cables actually 
was moving slowly, very much in 
fact like a boa awakening. 

Toby pointed. “John, what 
makes that thing move?” 

GALAXY 




Dane’s go^le-cyes glinted in 
the heatless sunli^t **Hysteresis, 
probably,” he said, his voice 
sounding doubly remote in the 
low fidelily of the walkie-talkie. 
"Up here we’re working at vir- 
tually cryogenic temperature, 
which means those cables carry 
even more power than their size 
would suggest. So if there’s any 
flaw that sets up resistance heat- 
ing, the effect is considerable, . 
Still, it shouldn’t be great enough 
to cause medianical motion; I’d 
better have it checked.” 

There was no copy in that, or 
anyhow, not more than a line or 
so. Toby tried one more journa- 
listic question, as indirectly as 
he could manage. 

"You couldn’t have found a re- 
moter spot, it seems to me. Why 
didn’t you just put the two-him- 
dred-incher on the Moon and be 
done with it? At least you’d have 
no seeing troubles up there.” 
"Now, you’re being obtuse, To- 
by. Putting it on the Moon would 
mean putting it in a deeper cra- 
ter, which would retrict its fidd 
of view by ten; it would still be 
a hundred times as vulnerable; 
and a thousand times as expen- 
sive. The government’s spent 
more than twice what I have, just 
getting a small orbital observa- 
tory up.” 

"True enou^” 

Dane turned away, to beckon 
to a distant figure, probably a 
74 



foreman. At tiie same moment, 
the slowly writiiing snake hitch- 
ed itself upward a little, and be- 
gan to smoke along its sharpest 
bend. 

“/ohn — ” 

Abruptly, the black sheath 
boiled away on the inside curve 
of the kink, exposing a basket- 
work of metal underneath al- 
ready glowing white. The cable, 
which had been bending outward 
toward the perimeter of the plat- 
form roughly in Dane’s direc- 
tion, snapped back toward Toby. 

T oby was not a fast thinker, 
but he had battlefield reflex- 
es. He dived for the cable, grab- 
bing for the opposite sides of 
the white-hot leaon. It parted in 
his face, the ends pulling out of 
his hands in opposite directions 
and drawing between them a 
screaming blue-green electric arc. 

Toby’s mittens vanished in two 
black puffs. The ends of the ca- 
ble, still connected by the arc, 
rose high in the air and then 
skimmed low over the smface 
of the nearer flatcar, the arc 
cutting through the provisional 
' girders like so much soft cheese. 
The arc went out and the cables 
flopped lifelessly to the deck, but 
the bridge at once began to top- 
ple, shedding screaming Indians 
like fruit 

Toby was already on his feet 
and charging, low, like a foot- 
GALAXY 



ball tackle. His shoulder took 
Dane low over one hip and they 
both went down with a slam, slid- 
ing along the searingly cold me- 
tal of the platform. Dane rolled 
and scrambled to a crouch as if 
instantly ready to fight, but as 
be reached his knees his eyes 
flicked skyward and he saw the 
great spread of metal girders de- 
scending upon them both like the 
spiderweb of God. He ran for 
the railroad track, Toby close 
behind him. 

The whole mountain seemed to 
shudder a.s the bridge fell on its 
side to the platform, though the 
noise was absurdly tinny in the 
almost non-existent air. 

Dane rose slowly and looked 
from side to side, his masked 
bead scaiming like a radar track- 
er. It took him thirty or forty 
seconds, apparently, to figure out 
tlie wreckage and what had 
caused it. Then he looked down 
at Toby and his shoulders jerked 
as if only this had caiised him 
any shock. 

Toby looked down too. He was 
still in shock, and though he re- 
membered having seen liis mit- 
tens vaporized in the great arc, 
he still seemed to be wearing 
tliem. Then he realized that it 
was his hands themselves he was 
looking at, their skin completely 
carbonized. And of course he 
could feel nothing; the hands 
were probably already frozen. 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



Dane bawled for a medico in a 
voice that nearly broke the ear- 
drum of the ear in which the 
walkie-talkie button was lodged 
— first in Spanish, then in Eng- 
lish, and then in what Toby sus- 
pected was Inca. 

It was about here that the 
pain came through, and Toby 
passed out, with gratitude. 

T Te came to, slowly, in what he 
* recognized as the sickbay of 
Dane’s personal supersonic jet, 
which was already airborne. He 
was alone and in bed, and in no 
pain at all. He looked down tlie 
counterpane at his own hands; 
they were only two immense 
balls of snow-white wrappings. 
On a shelf beside his head were 
several glasses, a bottle of pills 
and a bent plastic drinking tube. 
Nothing was to be seen through 
the nearest window but indigo 
sky, with two stars in it. 

There was no difficulty in fig- 
uring out what bad happened. 
He had been given an immense 
diot of morphine or something 
similar, some quick first aid, and 
lowered by portage and by cog- 
wheel to the puna; thence flown 
in some small craft to the town 
of Puna itself; and then put 
aboard Dane’s business aircraft. 
Evidently the drug was still hold- 
ing the pain back. That, and his 
inability to guess what day it 
was — or even what time of day, 
75 



for at the altitudes Dane’s plane 
had to fly, the sky was always star- 
red and indigo — ^both helped him 
to tliink and made him feel pe- 
culiarly detached, almost as 
though he were floating in some 
cloud-like medium much softer 
than any possible linen. 

After a while, he dozed and 
was awakened by the sound of 
tlie door to the sickbay being 
opened. Dane's physician peered 
in at him, ducked back, beckon- 
ed and vanished. 

Dane himself came in and sat 
down beside the bed, resting his 
elbows on his knees and bending 
over Toby. His perennially im- 
passive face, topped by its crew- 
cut of only slightly graying red 
hair, now wore something akin 
to an expression, although Toby 
could not figure out what it was. 
At a guess, it was a mixture of 
concern, self-reproach, grimness 
and pain; but no man’s face 
could show such a mixture all at 
once, and Toby had had enough 
experience at mis-reading Dane’s 
iron countenance to discount the 
guess out of hand. 

“How do you feel?” Dane said. 

‘‘I don’t feel a ^tlnng, thank 
God,” Toby said. ‘‘Where are we 
going? And as long as you raise 
the question, how do I feel?” 

“Rotten,” Dane said. “You’ve 
got second-degree bums all over 
both hands, but luckily they 
froze so fast that the tendons 
76 



don’t seem to be involved. Or so 
Charley says. We’re going to 
Denver. I’ve got some good peo- 
ple there who can probably re- 
grow the skin for you. I doubt 
that they could have done a 
thing about the musculature.” 
“That’s good,” Toby said, be- 
ginning to feel floaty again. “I’ll 
be able to type, and hold a pen- 
cil, arxd all that?” 

“Charley says so. If we get 
there on time — and we will.” 
Toby sighed. “John, I don’t 
know why the hell I follow you 
around. It isn’t tlie job. You’ve 
done nothing but get me into one 
jam after another since I was six- 
teen, beginning with that monu- 
mental drunk on cooking sherry. 
I still remember how I hated you 
the next morning in Advanced 
Algebra, when you showed up 
without a hangover.” 

“I had the world’s worst,” Dane 
said in a low voice. “Nobody can 
get drunk on cooking sherry with- 
out paying for it. I just wouldn’t 
let it show.” 

Hmm. Add one note to the par- 
lor psychoanalysis. 

“If it comes to that,” Dane 
said, “tliis is the second time yon 
have saved my life. You don’t 
even know what the first time 
was, and I’m not ever going to 
tell you, either. But I owe you 
an answer to another question, 
now. A small payment for a fa- 
vor, but I have to weigh sudi 
GALAXY

things in my own balance.” 

“You’re saving my hands,” 
Toby pointed out. “They're my 
life. But don’t let me talk you 
out of an answer! Whafs the 
question?” 

“That’s very far from being 
the issue,” Dane said slowly. 
“You won’t thank me for it. For 
one thing, you won’t be able to 
publish it. But what really counts 
is this: The reason why I don’t 
answer some questions is because 
I think the answers are fatal. 
You’re in no condition to take 
me seriously, but think it over. 
I mean what 1 say.” 

“I know you do. But curiosity 
is proverbially fatal. Come on, 
John. What is the question? The 
telescope?” 

“NO. No, indeed. But if you 
still want it, I’m going to show 
you why I built a mile-high of- 
fice building. Not just tell you 
— show you.” 

"You are a fiend, John Hillary 
Dane. You know I’ve been stew- 
ing over that for ten years.” 

“Yes,” Dane said, “and I plan 
to use that. Please remember, 
Toby, that I warned you. The an- 
swers to these questions are kill- 
ers. This one will almost surely 
kill you.” 

Toby looked down at his hands 
and listened to the expensively 
faint sound of the jet’s engines. 
At last he said: “Hang out more 
banners along the castle waUs,” 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



Dane Tower still stands, 
and probably will continue 
to stand for at least another cen- 
tury, empty though it is. It was 
well built, and the Denver area 
is not notable for earthquakes (if 
one excepts the artificial ones 
of 1968-80). 

From any point of view, it 
looks in silhouette like this: ) (, 
except that the two parentheses 
are pulled skyward so far that 
their inward curvature takes the 
acutest of eyes to detect. It is 
the first thing one sees poking up 
over the horizon as one approach- 
es the Denver plateau, and of 
course it utterly dominates the 
city. Black silhouette, it turns 
out to be black also in closeup, 
and windowl^s. 

The central offices of all 
Dane’s business interests had 
been relocated into it, but al- 
though these occupied more space 
than would have been taken up 
by the offices of more than four 
or five of the world’s govern- 
ments, they did not fill a third of 
the Tower; and because the Tow- 
er was so forbidding and had no 
windows, the remaining space for 
rent went mostly unrented, and 
half of the firms that originally, 
located there for prestige moved 
out again after only a few years. 
An elevator trip that carries one 
half a mile or more is not a good 
77 



way to begin a business day, or 
to end one, either, and the one 
core of elevator banks in die 
Tower gave mysteriously slow 
service even within tiieir design- 
ed capacity. The esplanade 
around the base of the building 
was small, and tiiere was no pro- 
vision for shops; and after a 
while, nobody but Dane’s em- 
ployees went to the Tower at 
all, on Dane busses. 

Altogether, it was an enter- 
prise completely out of character 
for Dane, who had built much 
of his fortune on a system of cost 
accounting that would have been 
the envy of any Bureau of In- 
land Revenue. At the very least, 
one would have thought, a man 
who owned the only mile-high 
building in the world — built on 
countryside that was itself a 
mile above sea level — would 
have thought to have put a ve- 
randa and an expensive restau- 
rant on top of it; but on the 
contrary, the top of Dane Tower, 
which looked like it was wearing 
a very tiny black derby, was as 
closed to visitors as the file room 
of a Swiss bank. 

I r^tead, Toby found, the great 
rotunda under the derby 
(which was not in fact black, but 
made of panels of one-way win- 
dow glass) was encirded by small 
cubicles which might have been 
either offices or laboratories; and 
78 



ifa center was totally taken up 
by huge, crouching, whining ma- 
chines, reminding him irresistibly 
of a Siemans-Sdmekert dynamo 
shed somehow hoisted two miles 
into the air as if on top of some 
tectonic piston. Most of the 
scuiT 3 dng employees he saw wore 
business trousers, but with white 
coats over them, like pharma- 
cists. He found this vaguely com- 
fortii^, since his hands, although 
healing, were still lightly swath- 
ed; but it offered him no clue 
as to what was going on here. 
These people could be clerks, 
scientists, engine«s, all three, or 
none of the three. 

“Wait here,” Dane said, park- 
ing Toby outside a double door. 
Toby waited. He was still a little 
light-headed, too; after all, in 
addition to having been near 
death, he had spent some months 
miles up in the air, and here he 
was again. 

After a while, the double doors 
opened, and Dane took him into 
what proved to be quite an or- 
dinary sort of conference room, 
complete with table, discreet 
hangings and a not-quite-con- 
cealed outlet for a projection 
room. There were even yellow 
pads and pencils neatly laid out, 
and ashtrays mathematically in 
place; but some of the trays were 
half-filled, and some of the pads 
scribbled upon, si^gesting that 
Dane had just evicted an on-go- 
GALAXY 



Jug meeting. Toby sniffed for 
smoke, but he himself smoked so 
heavily that it was only a token 
sniff. 

Besides, he was feeling not less, 
but more light-headed, and light- 
bodied, too. When Dane gestured 
him to a seat, he almost seemed 
to float to it. He could not guess 
why, for his first assumption — 
that he was still convalescent — 
had been contradicted by his ob- 
servation of the staff. They too 
had seemed to be moving in long, 
gliding steps, Uke people in a 
dream, or on the Moon. Toby 
knew very well that being in a 
fixed position only two miles 
above sea level did not notice- 
ably dilute gravity; after all, in 
Coropuna he had been nearly 
twice as high up and had noticed 
no such effect. 

He tried automatically to pick 
up a pencil, but his hands were 
still too bundled up for that — 
and in any case, Dane had warn- 
ed him that the story was unpub- 
lishable. Dane smiled gently at 
the aborted gesture, and said: 

“You’ll be too busy to write 
pretty soon, Toby. In the mean- 
time, I want to lay out for you 
a few facts that you’ll need to 
know, before either of ms can be- 
have sensibly. To begin with, I 
will answer your question. 

“I built the Dane Tower here, 
in Denver, because in exactly 
fifty-seven years from now, Den- 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



ver will be the capital of the 
world. And 1 built it a mile high 
becatise, fifty-seven years from 
now, almost all of the land areas 
of the Northern Hemisphere, and 
much of them in the Tropic of 
Capricorn, too, will be covered 
by a continuous city running 
from a mile to two miles deep. 
This platform on which we’re 
now sitting will be the center of 
— of a sort of public square, 
which will be both a center of 
government and a shrine for all 
of the land-boimd world.” 

tty Tow do you know that?” 
Toby said. “Jxist from pop- 
ulation statistics? Those wouldn’t 
help you to predict the — the 
continuous city you’re talking 
about.” 

“No, they wouldn’t. Such com- 
putations of course suggested 
such an outcome — along with 
many other possibilities. But I’d 
never have built a Tower like 
this if I hadn’t been s\ire. Come 
with me a moment and look at 
something; I see I’m not making 
it graphic enough. I’ve never 
talked to anybody with imagin- 
ation about this before.” 

Dane stood up — yes, that 
strange lightness of body was not 
just a drug illusion — and skim- 
med to a wall hanging, which he 
parted to reveal a big window. 
Beyond the window was nothing 
but §kjr -- no, not quite, for 
79 



shadowy peaks of the Rockies 
were barely visible in a strato- 
spheric haze. 

“In that direction,” Dane said 
soberly, “in fifty-seven years, 
there will be a broad avenue, 
bordered by rather ramshackle 
buildings most of which will be 
four or five stories higher than 
where we are standing now. Most 
of them look quite inflammable. 
It’s my impression that all the 
lower levels are nearly as ram- 
shackle for several thousand feet 
down, and then become sbirdier; 
and that even so, none of the 
whole complex would bear its 
own weight for an instant, if it 
weren’t tied horizontally to a 
great many central, vertical mem- 
bers like the Dane Tower.” 

“You talk as though you’ve 
seen it” 

“I have seen it. In a way. But 
before I explain that — and I’ll 
do more than that. I’ll also show 
you what I’ve seen — I want you 
to look at anotlier, more immedi- 
ate thing. It won’t make instant 
sense to you, but I’ve got good 
reasons for presenting my evi- 
dence in this exact order and no 
other.” 

“You’re the boss, John.” 

“No, but I’m trying. All right, 
come on out again. We’ll be 
back.” 

Dane led Toby out into the 
humming, busy rotunda once 
more, and down the line of cubi- 
80 



cles to a door which was heavilj 
sealed and insulated. There waj 
a microphone mounted in th« 
center of it, into which Dane 
spoke in a low voice. It was sev. 
eral minutes before he got an an. 
swer, and another long minute 
before the door was unsealed 
pulled guardedly ajar, by anothei 
one of those ubiquitous people in 
white coats — this one a pale 
girl who gave Toby a strange 
impression that she was trying 
not to cry. 

Inside, the cubicle had a mixed 
smell of animals and ozone and 
was quite hot. Along the right 
wall as Toby and Dane entered 
was a row of small cages, each 
of which contained two black 
kittens, all of whom set up a 
faint feeping noise at the new 
visitors ond began to mill around 
each other. Toby grinned at then^ 
amused as alwa5rs at the way 
only two kittens can imitate a 
mob scene when trying to draw 
attention. 

“Look closer,” Dane said. “You 
Have no idea how hard they are 
to breed.” 

t^oby looked closer, but for a 
moment saw nothing n^w. 
Then, all at once, he saw a whole 
series of singularities. All the 
kittens were the same age — 
about two month's; all bore a 
white star on the forehead and 
a white blaze on the chest; and 
GALAXY 



each pair in eacn cage were iden- 
tical twins. 

“Breeding show cats is diffi- 
cult enough,” Dane added, “be- 
cause they revert to alley-cats at 
the first cross — everything is 
double-recessive. But these are 
alley-cats to begin with, and 
they have to come out almost ex- 
actly alike. It took two Nobelists 

a molecular biologist and a 

geneticist — to get this line start- 
ed and guarantee that it’d keep 
on coming out like this. But it’s 
required.” 

“By whom?” 

“I’m not ready to answer tHat 
quite yet. But soon. In the mean- 
time, look on the other side.” 

The other side consisted of 
a laboratory bench of formica or 
some such substance, set at the 
same level as the shelf on which 
the cats’ cages sat. In the mid- 
dle of it stood an object like a 
gallon jug of very thick glass, ex- 
cept tliat it had no neck, and had 
been opened vertically down the 
middle as though hinged at the 
back. Above it, on the shaft of 
a ringstand, hovered a tall torus 
of closely wound wire, obviously 
big eno ugh in diameter to sur- 
round the jug when the jug was 
closed and the coil slid down 
around it. 

“Time’s short, I won’t explain 
further yet,” Dane said, and then 
to the pale girl: “This is dose 
to transmission time, isn’t it?” 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



“Yes, Mister Dane, but — ” 

“Go ahead. I’ll vouch for Mis- 
ter Walker.” 

Turning to the cages, the girl 
deftly extracted a kitten, swung 
to the apparatus, popped the kit- 
ten into the parted jug, and closed 
the sides. The kitten was now in 
a sitting position inside the jug, 
with only its head protruding. 
She now lowered the torus so 
that it surrounded the belly of 
the jug. In so doing, she brought 
into view an attachment like a 
shallow copper cap, which fitted 
snugly over the kitten’s head be- 
tween its ears; and, behind tlit 
“up” position of the coil, a wall 
clock. 

Feep! the kitten said, more in 
puzzlement than in protest. 

The girl turned a switch, pro- 
dudng a heavy hum of power, 
so deep as to sound more like the 
warming up of a subway gener- 
ator than anything that miglit be 
hea^4 in a small laboratory. Her 
hand now moved to a key. and 
she began to watch the dock. 

As the clock’s sweep-hand pass- 
ed whatever point she was await- 
ing, she depressed tjfe key. There 
was a soft pop!, like the break- 
ing of a small light bulb but 
without the accompanying glassy 
sound, and the kitten’s head 
vanished. 

Up went the coil and open 
came the jug, revealing that the 
rest of the kitten was gone too. 

81 



The girl repeated the operation 
with its twin, and ^en shut off 
tile power. 

“Thatis all tiiere is to see here; 
we only send two on any given 
day, one day a week,” Dane said. 
“Now let’s go back to the board 
room.” 

“Send them where?” Toby 
said, already afraid he knew the 
answer. 

“Into the future, of course. 
Come on, and I’ll give you your 
own look. It won’t be a very 
good one, but you’ll see every- 
thing that we’ve managed to see. 
We can’t very well do better 
than that.” 

A 11 this trotting back and forth 
was not exactly decreasing 
Tobys confusion. Except for the 
spectacle of the vanishing kittens, 
he would have begun to suspect 
that Dane was losing his grip on 
reality, a phenomenon not infre- 
quent in lonely men possessed.of, 
or by, virtually imlimited power. 

In the conference room, Dane 
sat Toby down at the table with 
his back to the projection booth; 
and then, instead of picking up 
the conversation, picked up a 
telephone instead. 

“Dane here,” he said. “Get me 
Accounting . Hello, Sal? I 
want to arrange an open trans- 
fer of funds, in such a way that 
the remaining sum after income 
and gift taxes is one million dol- 
82 



lars. The recipient is Tobias R. 
Walker — ” 

“Hey, wait, damnit — ” 

Dane cut Toby off with a sharp 
gesture. “You’ll find a dossier on 
him in the press file, including 
his bank and account number — 
oh, you know who he is. Good, 
that simplifies tilings. Yes, effec- 
tive immediately.” 

“Now look here,” Toby said, 
the instant Dane had hung up. 
“Maybe I did save your goddam 
life. But I did it out of friendship, 
and for that matter I would ha^ 
done it out of simple decency 
for one of your Indians, or any- 
body. I damn well don’t want to 
be paid off for it Being shown 
what you’re doii^ up here is 
more than enough!” 

“My dear Toby, this is not a 
payoff. It is either a bribe or a 
commisrion, depending upon how 
you come to look at it after you 
have all the facts. Will you give 
me time to explain?” 

“Well ... I suppose so. But I 
warn you, tiie chances are ninety 
to one that I’ll send the money 
right back, the moment I have 
the chance.” 

“I can’t prevent that I in my 
turn warned you that my an- 
swers tend to be fatal. In the 
present instance, even if you keep 
the money, you vrill have rela- 
tively little time to spend it, and 
perhaps none at all. Now, let’s 
look at some pictures.” 



GALAXY 



He touched one of a small 
portable rank of buttons, and 
hangings opposite the projection 
booth pulled aside. Another 
touch, and the room went dark. 

IV 

((As is now obvious,” Dane’s 
voice said in the black- 
ness, “I’ve been fooling around 
with Time. The discovery of the 
effect was an accident, and the 
theory is dead secret; I intend 
to explain it to nobody, and to 
see to it that none of my experts 
leaks it, either. What matters 
for your purposes is what we 
found. 

“Effectively, we can see a short 
distance into the future — not 
directly, but tiirough a process 
which allows us to take still pho- 
tographs, all of rather bad qual- 
ity. We’ve taken thousands, and 
spent the better part of the last 
five years interpreting tiiem. It 
took las several years just to real- 
ize that tile altitude above the 
surface of the Earth of the cam- 
era exactly matched to the al- 
titude in the future. We got hun- 
dreds of murky, useless photos 
before we found that we had to 
be up two miles before we could 
see the surface of the world-city. 
Hence, the Dane Tower. 

“I’ve had slides made of the 
key pictures. Here’s the first one.” 

The screen lit up. The photo 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



— if that was what it was — was 
in black and white and seemed 
to show a street scene rather 
like the one Dane had described 
to Toby while tiiey had been 
looking out of the window at the 
Rockies. Details, however, were 
impossible to make out; not only 
was the picture badly out of fo- 
cus, but it had an overall milky 
quality, as if the camera had 
leaked light even before the shot 
had been taken. 

"In general, the 3 r’re all this 
bad,” Dane said, “but in a given 
series of shots of the same scene, 
each one comes close to being 
sharp in a different small area. 
We’ve had composites made up 
of all the sharp spots which I can 
show you later, but I wanted you 
to see the originals first. Now, 
these are the people — a micro- 
scopic fraction of them.” 

The next slide showed the same 
scene, but there were figures in 
the street. They were vaguely 
graceful, and seemed to be clad 
in loose garments with long 
sleeves, like Arab robes. One face 
was almost in focus, and it was 
startlingly handsome, but Toby 
could not tell what sex it was. 

“We know relatively little 
about the people who live in the 
lower levels. However, there 
seems to be no doubt that social 
status depends upon nearness to 
the surface, just as in The Time 
Machine or Metropolis or scores 
83 



of later works on the same theme. 
The people you see in the picture 
are not the ruling class, which is 
essentially an engineers’ guild, but 
parasites of some sort, like Wells’ 
•Eloi’. They may be the children 
of the ruling class, or they may 
represent some more complicated 
social setup. We haven’t been 
able to settle that. 

“Not all the world-city is two 
miles high, by the way, but it’s 
almost nowhere less than a mile 
high. I should think that this 
would be a distinction without a 
difference to the poor slobs who 
have to live at the bottom. We 
don’t know how deep under the 
Earth all this runs, either, but 
again that’s almost an academic 
question. 

“Here is another shot of the 
people. You’ll see that they seem 
to be conducting some sort of 
ceremony or celebration, or 
whatever. Or maybe it’s just their 
equivalent of a Saturday night 
dance.” 



O r tn&ybe John Hillary Dane 
has just lost his marbles, 
Toby recalled with a pang the 
fix Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had 
developi*d on Spiritualism, one 
outcome of which had been a 
passionate tract disguised as a 
novel called The Land of Mist. 
And Doyle, though remembered 
nOw almost solely for Sherlock 
84 



Holmes, had been one of the no- 
blest, most versatile and most 
brilliant men of his era. 

“The pictures in this series led 
us to a complicated but lucky 
accident. We had been trying 
to see if we could pull anything 
back from the future besides pat- 
terns of energy. Theoretically it 
was possible, but we found that 
we just couldn’t muster the ne- 
cessary power for it. The general 
energy level of the universe — 
what Milne called the t-tau rela- 
tionship — is higher in the future 
than it is in the present, and 
given that plus the basic Ein- 
steinean equation, grabbing even 
a tiny object from up there would 
call for a surge of power equiva- 
lent to several megatons. We 
couldn’t confine it, not usefully. 

“However, something else was 
working for us. Have you noticed 
anything odd about the gravity 
on top of this building?” 

“Yes. I feel lighter. I thought 
it was just the drugs and so on, 
but I noticed that people move 
differently.” 

“Precisely,” Dane said. “The 
t-tau spread increases with time, 
but the gravitational constant — 
which, obviously, isn’t a constant 
at all — weakens. You wouldn’t 
think fifty years would make so 
noticeable a difference, but it 
seems that in the course of our 
tampering with Time, we’ve cre- 
ated some kind of leak in which 
GALAXY 



gravitational energy is flowing 
from here into the future. This 
has all kinds of theoretical impli- 
cations which I won’t bother you 
with, but what it meant for us, 
in practice, was that although 
we couldn’t pull an object back 
from the future, we could send 
one forward. 

“Of course this instantly made 
us wonder if we could send a 
live object . not just a rock, 
but nn assemblage of matter 
which also carried a characteris- 
tic energy pattern, just like the 
pictures we were getting back. 
The t-tau relationship said No, 
because the life energy pattern 
is unique in that it has negative 
entropy, but we tried it anyhow. 

“The first animal we tried, 
as it hapoened, was a black Ht- 
ten. It showed up on one of these 
feast days, or dances, or whatever 
they are, and produc«=d a sensa- 
tion. Here is one of the pictures.” 

slide showed more "race- 
ful figures, bending bJurrily 
over something which might have 
been a black kitten, or a lump 
of coal. Toby now remembered 
also that Conan Doyle had been 
completely taken in by two little 
girls who had produced photo- 
graphs of what they claimed were 
fairies, but later had been shown 
to be pictures cut out of adver- 
tise.ments in popular magazines. 
The noblest intellect of his time 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



bad published a book which had 
include the photographs. Dane’s 
slides strongly resemble tiiem. 

“A lot of experiments showed 
that if we sent forward two such 
kittens, people came boiling out 
of the building to look at them, 
and the more the kittens resem- 
bled each other, the greater the 
excitement. Our breeding pro- 
gram was the result, and we now 
have a whole new ceremony in 
the future organized around the 
weekly appearance of these twins. 

“Again, the details aren’t im- 
portant. The essence of the mat- 
ter is that the development gave 
us immense amounts of new soci- 
ological data to work with. The 
mathematical biology of social 
behavior has come a long dis- 
tance since Rashevsky. Also, it 
helped that we get the kittens 
back in a week; they revert to tlie 
energy level they were bom into, 
along the world-line widened by 
the gravity flow. Their disap- 
pearance, just before the new 
batch arrives, creates more ex- 
citement, and more data for us. 
It also makes the inbreeding pro- 
gram simpler for us. You’ll be 
interested to see this week’s 
pair pop out of nothingness next 
week, if you’re still with me then 
. especially if you’re still think- 
ing about all this in terms of ecto- 
plasm, apporfs and the like.” 
Toby grinned feebly, but did 
not deny the accusation. He was 
85 



just as pleased that the grin was 
invisible in the darkness, but he 
would not have been surprised 
to be told that Dane had sensed 
it anyhow. 

“Now, Toby, it seems clear 
that tills isn’t a very happy so- 
ciety, at least from our point of 
view; but it’s also clear that it 
I functions, more or less. It was 
also dear, almost from the be- 
‘ ginning, that it couldn’t function 
without computer control of al- 
) most everything. The magnitude 
I of data involved — people, en- 
I ergy flow, food, repair, logistics 
j of every sort — precluded any 
I other possibility. We searched a 
I long time for that computer, be- 
: cause we thou^t anything so ad- 

vanced would be the most worth- 
while thing to study of anything 
in the future that might be acces- 
sible to us. 

“We had a hell of a time find- 
i ing it — we looked in all the 
logical but wrong places. It seem- 
ed to be utterly invisible. Well, 
it was, and for a good reason: 

' it was all around us — or will 
be. It’s based right on this floor 
I of th^ building, and goes on up 
in the air about a himdred feet. 
We took our camera up on the 
roof when we figured this out, 
and here’s one of the pictures we 
got.” 

Toby would have found it 
I hard to say what he expected 
the slide to show, but certainly 
86 



nothing like this. Against a back- 
groimd of dark sky appeared a 
fragment of thick, irregular web- 
work; it was not only senseless, 
but so obviously incomplete that 
Toby at first could not even think 
of anything to compare it to. It 
was, it was, well, a little like a 
photograph of Dane’s radio-tele- 
scope bridge, after the thing bad 
not only collapsed but somehow 
been partially melted (at a height 
of more than two miles? Ridicu- 
lous.) At the same time, the 
thing looked almost biological; it 
might have been a medium-power 
photomicrograph of a piece of 
spoi^e. In the background float- 
ed several spherical objects, all 
with highlights along the same 
side — they were, in fact, lit from 
the same direction as the web- 
work was — of which he could 
make no sense at all, unless the 
Earth of half a century in the 
future had acquired a whole 
flock of artificial satellites big 
enough to compete with the nat- 
ural one. 

“As you can see,” Dane’s 
voice went on evenly, “it’s not at 
all like any existing such ma- 
chine. Insofar as we’ve been able 
to ^ure it out, it is most closely 
analogous to the Golgi network 
in the human cerebrum — a 
web of conducting members en- 
closing, or underlying, a force 
field where the real work is being 
done. Those small round bodies 
GALAXY 



you see actually number in at 
least the hundreds; they circulate 
in and out of the web in irregu- 
lar pathways and may prevent 
specific bodies of information, or 
, . well, we just don’t know, not 
reliably. 

“Now, here is where you come 
in, Toby — you and your mil- 
lion dollars. Or where we hope 
you’ll come in.” 

The projector went out, the 
drapes rustled, and the lights 
went on. Toby was completely 
dazzled. While he was still try- 
ing to get his eyesight back, Dane 
said in the same even and imemo- 
tional tone: 

“I want you to go up there 
and sabotage that machine.” 



same old question. 
But this time, Dane had to an- 
swer. 

“ ‘Sabotage’ is the wrong word; 
actually we want you to repair it, 
but the machine is a sacred ob- 
ject — nobody is allowed to touch 
it — so we’ll have to equip you 
just as if you were a saboteur, 
and you’ll have to behave as if 
you were. 

“The reason is inherent in tKe 
worship. You’ll recall my telling 
you that we’ve been studying this 
society for nearly a decade. In 
tiie course of the study, we be- 
came convinced that the compu- 
ter was suffering some kind of 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 






The 



slow breakdown. I also mention- 
ed fifty-seven years, but actually 
the period we see is fifty-fiVe 
years in the future; we thinlf 
the breakdown will reach a cri- 
sis two years from now, after 
which we won’t be able to do a 
thing for it. 

“The people themselves know 
less about the machine than we 
do — much less. They’ve taken 
it for granted for all of their 
lifetimes, which appear to be 
short — for obvious reasons, 
when you come to think of it. 
We, on the other hand, now think 
we know which component of the 
machine is going haywire. We can 
show you diagrams of the appa- 
ratus which will give you a pret- 
ty good idea of its gross workings, 
and we can also supply you with 
a map of its layout, its geogra- 
phy, so to speak. 

“We’ve prepared a replace- 
ment; you’ll go forward, locate 
the failing part, rip it out, and 
insert our replacement” 

“John,” Toby said, “this time 
you have to go all the way to 
the end. And so again I ask you, 
w/jy?” 

Dane spread his hands. “I 
riiould think that would be self- 
evident. Repugnant as that uni- 
versal tenement, or hive, or what- 
ever-it-is may look to us, it’s the 
society those people have got, 
and all they’ve got If it collapses, 
the disaster will be unimagina- 
87 



ble. Many millions will die; bil- 
lions will suffer; liiey are inca- 
pable of running thdr world with- 
out that computer.” 

Talk about philanthropies! The 
Dane Observatory was peanuts, 
compared to this. But Toby knew 
that there lay the ultimate why, 
and to ask it would be to ques- 
tion Dane’s good will. He said 
instead : 

“I sec the point. Once I’m con- 
vinced, I’ll probably be willing 
to try it, as I’m sure you knew. 
So, John — why did you feel 
obliged to offer me a million 
dollars for the job?” 

“Because,” Dane said, “one 
way or another, you will probably 
die. We get the kittens back, but 
kittens are not people, and we 
have no way of asking them their 
state of mind. Two, I don’t know 
whether we can get you back at 
all. Three, if the people up there 
catch you messing around with 
their god-brain, they may tear 
you slowly to shreds, no matter 
how well we arm and armor you, 
“And the process, as you saw, 
involves a colossal jolt of power. 
It will probably feel almost ex- 
actly like being electrocuted. I 
wovUdn’t take a millibn dollars 
on that chance alone, no, not if 
I were a pauper with nineteen 
starving children.” 

Toby said slowly: “I won’t 
take a million dollars for it, 
either. But if you’ll phone down 
88 



to your accountant and cancel 
that draft, I’m willing to talk 
about it further. Otherwise, not.” 

V 

T oby spent much of the next 
week studying the maps, with 
breaks for Charley to examine 
his hands, which seemed to be 
getting along nicely. Dane had 
quite vanished, which was rea- 
sonable; no matter how large the 
Dane Tower project looked to 
Toby, it was only a fragment of 
Dane’s interests — which, after 
all, he had to keep in order if he 
was to continue to support crazy 
enterprises like the Tower and 
the Observatory. 

At the end of the week, Dane 
reappeared, to join Toby in the 
kennel-cum-laboratory to await 
the return from the future of the 
kittens. There was nothing spec- 
tacular about it: Pop!, and then, 
Feep/ And there they were. They 
looked, Toby thought, a little 
dazed at first, but it is hard to 
read a kitten’s expression — it 
always looked a little dazed; 
and besides, at the very best, To- 
by would have been a little dazed 
himself under the circumstances. 
Otherwise, the animals were ap- 
parently unhurt, and were trans- 
ferred promptly to a larger ken- 
nel to become part of the inbreed- 
ing cycle as they reached puberty. 
“Satisfied?” Dane said 



GAUXY 




The pale ^1, nevertheless, 
continued to look sad about the 
whole process of which was 
in charge. 

“Well, it isn’t fatal to tiiem, 
anyhow. I’d adopt either of them 
if I were in the market.” 

“Help yourself.” 

Dane vanished once more, 
though, without either feep or 
pop. 

D uring the succeeding week, 
Toby was made acquainted 
with the component. It looked re- 
marirably like some peculiarly 
vicious combination of flame- 
thrower, machine-pistol and ba- 
zooka. which was not an acci- 
dent Most of it was in fact a 
weapon, which Toby was sternly 
told to use without compunction 
if he was detected before he had 
completed his mission. Only one 
of die grips, the one nearest the 
body, was actually the replace- 
ment component This would 
break out of the main body of 
the gun into the right hand with 
one sharp wrench of the wrist. 
What it then consisted of, to the 
eye, was a flattened cylinder with 
three prongs on one end. All To- 
by had to do, the technicians ex- 
plained, was to find the socket 
tliose prongs fitted into, and 
squeeze the sides of the cylinder. 
The device would then freeze 
solidly in place, and the job 
woulcl be done.

Easy enough. Just like getting 
Santa and the toys down the 
chimney and back up again. Ho 
ho ho. 

Nevertheless, the reasoning be- 
hind it was easy to understand. 
What surprised Toby more was 
the elaborateness of the armor 
he was also supposed to wear. It 
was, in fact, a full-fledged space- 
suit, of a rather old-fashioned 
model, heavy, shiny, balloony, 
stiff at the points and topped by 
a helmet with a very restricted 
field of view. It looked not much 
advanced over the suit worn by 
the first men to walk on the 
Moon — where it had prob- 
ably been fairly satisfactory in 
the slight gravity and under no 
need to clamber rapidly and fur- 
tively through the interior of a 
gigantic sponge, ready to dodge 
at every instant. 

That, the technicians explain- 
ed to him, could not be helped. 
He had to bear in mind that he 
would emerge in the future more 
than two miles above sea level, 
where an ox 3 rgen mask would be 
a essential to keep his 

reflexes and his thinking at opti- 
mum. The people of the future 
surface, like the Andean Indians, 
were acclimatized to the low oxy- 
gen tension of 12,000 feet, but 
he was not. The helmet would 
give him a better field of view 
than would the goggles of an 
oxyg«i mask, but the only way 
GALAXY 



to keep a helmet filled with suf- 
ficient oxygen was to attach it 
to a pressure suit. And since they 
had to give him a pressure suit, 
they might also just as well ar- 
mor it — 

“ — against the sHngs, arrows 
and low-velocity bullets of out- 
rageous fortune,” Toby said. 
“Okay, okay. I suppose every 
hero in a Western wishes Central 
Casting had given him a softer 
horse,” 

He exercised in the suit, whicK 
under the peculiar gravity field 
prevailing on the top of Dane 
Tower was more flerible and 
lighter than he had expected. 
He was not fooled. This only 
meant it would be stiffer and 
heavier, inside the world-brain, 
fifty-five years hence. 

H e also practiced, on an evac- 
uated and insulated range, 
vrith the weapon, which turned 
out to be a laser rifle far ad- 
vanced beyond any such Toby 
had ever seen, or even heard hint- 
ed at, in the arsenals of contem- 
porary armies — and as an occa- 
rional war correspondent, he was 
supposed to be as expert at sucK 
matters as any civilian is ever 
allowed to be. Another barrel of 
milli ons for Dane, whomever 
Dane eventually sold it to; but 
as for Toby, ^er several days 
of watching dummies carefully 
composed to be of the exact con- 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



sistency of flesh and bone evapor- 
ate instantly at the merest toucH 
of its flash, his majcw prayer of 
the whole affair unexpectedly 
came to be that he would never 
have to fire it on the job. 

The firing range practice was 
at least interesting, however hor- 
rible. The practice at plugging 
the component into a dummy 
socket, and then getting the hell 
away, under the eye of a stop- 
watch, was not. But he knew it 
was probably much more impor- 
tant. This he would have to do; 
firing the gun was only a possibil- 
ity. 

At the end of that week, Char- 
ley took the bandages off, and 
Toby exercised his hands on vari- 
ous grips and squeezers. They 
looked death-white, but they 
worked, very well. Charley was 
pleased; Toby was not. Those 
last bandages had been only 
token ones, not at all in the way 
of his practice with the rifle and 
its concealed' component; but to 
Toby they had represented the 
last barrier between himself and 
the slowly rotting sponge on top 
of the future. 

Dane came back the next day, 
also looking pleased, in his rigid 
and abstracted way. He looked 
at Toby’s hands, watched him 
fire the rifle, timed him on the 
plug-in and getaway exercise, 
tested him on the map, read over 
all tile test records which had 
91 



been compiled in his absence. 
One of Dane’s major mottoes 
was I trust my subordinates, 
But. At the end, he said, “Good, 
very good.” 

“You mean I can go now?” 
Toby said. He was surprised to 
find that he was burning to get 
it all over with, 

“Hell no, Toby. All this has 
been just warmup. While it’s 
been going on, we’ve built a full- 
scale model of the brain over 
your head, on the top of the Tow- 
er. Tomorrow you get the suit 
on. pick up the gadget, climb out 
there and go through the whole 
routine — bearii^ in mind that 
if you slip, you won’t just fall 
to a street among a lot of fairies. 
You’ll fall two miles, and I’ll 
have to find myself another boy. 
And while you’re doing it, I may 
just stand out on the balcony 
and throw rocks at you.” 

“I’ve changed my mind,” Toby 
said. 

WhaiF’ 

‘TU take the million dollars.” 
VI 

W hen they lowered Toby out 
of the high sky and the 
model brain, the padding of the 
pressure suit was soaked with 
sweat, and Dane let Toby lie 
quietly and shake for two days 
while the technicians worked 
frantically to improve the suit’s 
92 



water cycling. You would have 
thought, Toby thought ironically, 
shaking, that after all these 
years of experience with space- 
suits, somebody would have 
solved that problem; but evi- 
dently no suit had ever been de- 
signed to cope with just one hour 
of concentrated stress which j 
would include the whole mission; 
previous spacesuit designers had f 
thought in terms of months, orj 
years. 

While Toby slowly stopped 
shaking, Dane swore. He was on 
the spot every minute now, for 
the end of this week was launch- 
ing lime. At last the technicians 
were convinced that they had the 
water problem licked, and some 
violent exercise inside the refur- 
bished suit did not, at least, con- 
tradict them. This time, though,! 
Toby was unable to summon the 
extremes of fear he had felt atop 
the Dane Tower, although he 
was convinced that he was not 
very far from them. The final 
test would have to be the mission 
itself. 

A nd The Day at last came, and 
Toby was stuffed, bolted and 
sealed into the suit for the last 
time, along with the knowledge: 
that he might never be taken out. 
of it again. He was handed the 

weapon-cum-component, and in- 
troduced to his own personal ver- 
sion of the magic jug: an insulat- 
GALAXf 







ed room on the roof, a metal chair 
centered upon an elevated metal 
plate and a capped coil to be 
lowered around him. Dane and 
his operators watched from a 
control room behind glass; Toby 
noticed that the pale girl was not 
among them and wondered if 
Dane had suffered a minor mu- 
tiny in the ranks. On the wall 
facing Toby was a clock, pre- 
svanably duplicating one in the 
control room. It swept toward 
the zero hour, at first with gla- 
cial slowness, and then suddenly 
as if the pace of Time had dou- 
bled. 

“Can you hear me all right, 
Toby?” the smfs radio said in 
Dane’s voice. 

“Sure.” 

“Remember that you won’t be 
able to in the future. We’ll take as 
many pictures as possible while 
you’re there, but if you get in 
trouble, there won’t be a thing 
we can do to help you.’^*^ 

"I know that. You’ve told me 
that at least a dozen times.” 
“Don’t be jumpy. I’m just try- 
ing to make perfectly sure that 
you have every fact you need. 
We’ve already sent on the usual 
two kittens, but half an hour 
late. We’re hoping that between 
the usual ceremony, and the un- 
usual lateness, they^U be too dis- 
tracted to notice you.” 

Toby knew that, too. He real- 
ized belatedly that Dane was 
94 



simply chattering to keep him 
distracted and as close to relaxed 
as possible when the moment of 
transmission came. His glance 
shot up to the clock. 

Two seconds to zero! 

One — 

Every muscle in his body went 
into spasm. Every nerve shrieked 
in silent agony. 

It lasted forever, in flashing 
blackness and roaring silence. 

Then he was standing in the 
high sky, exactly on the part of 
the world-brain he had so pains- 
takingly memorized. The incredi- 
ble pain vanished so completely 
as to leave hardly a memory; it 
was so close to instantaneous that 
he almost staggered with reUef. 
Luckily, the suit prevented him; 
it was indeed much heavier here. 

Without looking down — for 
he had no time to dieck on 
whether the natives were indeed 
distracted — he hoisted the weap- 
on-component assemblage and 
began to climb. Several of the 
little moon-like globes — “bit- 
bundles,” one of the technics had 
called them — floated past him, 
and one swerved toward him, as 
if in curiosity, although he had 
been assured that this was un- 
likely. Then he — 

was back in the ttansaussion 

chamber aiain. 

H e looked toward the glass 
front of the control room, 
GALAXY 



bewildered. His only impression 
was of Dane’s face, wearing an 
expression he could clearly read: 
shock, frustration, inh uman de- 
termination. Then Dane made a 
slight movement. 

Eternal agony. 

He was back on the brain, but 
at the spot to which his few pre- 
vious steps had taken him. This 
time the pain was distinctly slow 
about dwindling. He b^an to 
climb once more. 

The rransmfss/on chamber. It 
could only have been a few sec- 
onds later: Dane’s expression was 
still in the process of hard enin g, 
Dane hit the kqr again. 

The total agony of electrocu- 
tion. When the hi^ sky flashed 
over him again, he was weak, 
and hia nerves were thrilling with 
pain. 

He took two steps more. 

Transmission chamber. Dane’s 
face was a Greek mask, a mock- 
ii^ twisted mask of pity and 
fury at once. His hand pressed 
down — 

Anguish upon anguish. The 
high sky. One step. Toby stagger- 
ed. 

He was nearly blind with pain 
now. 

Chamber. Mask. Key. 

Death. Sky. Uadiminished 
pain. 

With the last motion of which 
he was physically capable, Toby 
threw the weapon away. 

THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



VII 

convalesce from having 
been executed four times 
is a long process. For the first 
few weeks, if Dane showed up at 
all, Toby was incapable of notic- 
ing it. All he saw, and that only 
in fragile gleams, was the grad- 
ual lightening of that darkness of 
gloom which is eternity. 

Then, gradually, the world began 
to obtrude. The people who at- 
tended him were hushed, as if in 
the presence of something more 
than a corpse, alfliough it v/as 
impossible for them to have 
known how far beyond death he 
had already been. 

It was more than a month be- 
fore Dane appeared. His face, 
which would not ever be a mys- 
tery to Toby any more, was re- 
mote and abstracted, as though 
he were thinkin g now about some 
new project which had nothing 
to do with the Dane Tower, let 
alone Toby; but he said: 

“I’m sorry.” 

“I’m sorry too,” Toby said 
slowly, “in a good many ways. 
But you did warn me. And I find 
I still have a little curiosity left. 
What went wrong, do you know?” 
“We think we know. Essentially, 
it was the difference between a 
man and an animal. Living things, 
all living things, differ from oth- 
er energy processes in the uni- 
verse in having negative entropy 
95 



— that’s the definition of life, 
or the best one we have. The 
higher the nervous organization, 
the more negentropy — the more 
energy consolidating itself, in- 
stead of slowly dissipating and 
downgrading in the standard way. 
A cat has pretty close to the 
highest degree of nervous organi- 
zation in the animal kingdom, 
but a man is so much higher 
still that he’s virtually a differ- 
ent order of entity. The quan- 
titative difference is so great that 
it becomes, to all intents and 
purposes, qualitative.” 

Toby puzzled over this for 
several minutes. 

“In other words, if you’d sent 
an earthworm up there, you might 
not have gotten it back for 
years.” 

“That seems to be it. Whereas 
we’ll never be able to keep a 
man there for more than a few 
seconds. And the farther in the 
future we try to send him, the 
shorter the stay will be.” 

4CT see.” Toby fell silent again. 

A Then, at last, he continued : 

“I said I was sorry. But not 
completely. I’m sorry I had to 
go through the experience — it 
wasn’t pleasant I’m sorry it 
turned out to be for notliing. But 
above all, I’m sorry you turned 
out to be the kind of man who 
would put a friend through it 
four times. I am indeed going to 
96 



keep the money, John. No sum 
will ever pay me for what I went 
through, and no sum could make 
up for losing what I thought I 
saw in you. I shan’t spend it. any 
more than I could spend my own 
blood, but maybe my children, 
if I ever have anj^, won’t feel the 
same way about it. 

“But it will be nice to have the 
interest, because I’m going to 
ask the paper for a new assign* 
ment, and I suspect that nothing 
new that I’m given will be as 
lucrative as working with you 
was. I won’t be seeing you again, 
Not ever, if I can help it.” 

“I understand that,” Dane, 
said. “Every time I answer one 
of those questions — questions of 
this kind — I lose somebody,' 
one way or another. I expectedj 
nothing else. But I too have ray 
curiosity, Toby. You’re not com* 
pletely sorry. What is it that you 
don't regret?” 

“Failing.” 

“Oh,” Dane said slowly. “Will' 
you say why?” 

“Yes. It’s one of the reasons 
why I don’t want to see you any 
more. I think you lied to me. I 
don’t believe there was anytliing 
wrong with die big computer, the 
world-brain. But I think some 
thing would have gone wronj 
with it if I had managed to plug 
your component into it. You did 
not want to save that society, 
You wanted to destroy it.” 

GALAXf 



The two men’s eyes met. Ac- 
knowledgment was already plain 
to Toby in Dane’s expression. 

“Quite true,” Dane said 
steadily. “The society was noth- 
ing more than the ultimate dead- 
end of the society we have right 
now. And the computer; I sus- 
pect — though I can’t be posi- 
tive — is perfect. If it doesn’t 
fail or get disrupted somehow — 
it will maintain the universal 
tenement forever.” 

“Nothing is perfect,” Toby 
said, “and nothing is forever. But 
the fact is, John, you weren’t out 
to prevent the death of millions 
and the misery of billions of oth- 
ers — with me as cat’s-paw. You 
were out to cause it.” 

^ ( Tn effect,” Dane said, “yes. 

One last question, Toby, if 
I may turn the tables on you just 
once. I don’t see how you detect- 
ed that my intentions were op- 
posite to my statement of them. 
It seems to me that I left very 
few clues.” 

“You left no dues at all. But 
at the bf^ ifmin g, when you asked 
me to take the job on — this was 
after the slide show in the con- 
ference room — your tongue slip- 
ped. You called it ‘sabotage.’ 
Your explanation was glib and 
I took it at face value — until 
I saw your face during the three 
times you sent me forward again. 
It was not just the face of a man 
THE CITY THAT WAS THE WORLD 



knowingly executing a friend. It 
was the face of a fanatic. In the 
past month, lydng here, I’ve been 
seeing that face, and hearing it 
speak the word ‘sabotage.’ And I 
knew that the face and the word 
went together.” 

Dane got to his feet. 

“I never did trust poets,” he 
said. “So perhaps it’s just as well 
that we’re parting. And to do you 
credit, Toby, not only were you 
as brave as I expected you to be, 
but you might even be right. It 
might be just as well, too, that 
it proved to be impossible to de- 
stroy the machine. I’m already 
working on another approach.” 
“I’m not surprised. Good-by, 
John.” 

“Good-by.” 

They shook hands formally, 
without warmth, and Dane 
moved away from the bed, 
“John.” 

Dane turned back halfway, 
but he did not look bade. His 
mind was already on other mat- 
ters “What is it?” he said. 

“John, I don’t know what your 
next project is, and I don’t Want 
to know. But I’ve also been think- 
ing about your one-before-last, 
and I think there’s something 
you ought to bear in mind.” 
“Very well,” Dane said, “What?” 
“Telescopes,” Toby said, “no 
matter how powerful, see only 
into the past.”

EUGEN SAENGER AND 
THE ROCKET -PROPELLED 
AIRPLANE 

T he first airplane that flew with 
a liqtiid-fuel rocket engine 
as its means of propxilsion was 
the German interceptor Messer- 
schmitt Me-163B, named Komet. 
It first appeared in action during 
March 1944 and surprised the 
pilots of Allied bombers by the 



98 



fantastic bursts of speed it could 
perform. 

The design of the Me-163A 
(the prototype of Me-163B had 
grown out of wartime needs; it 
Had nothing to do with Max Va- 
lier's concepts of 1927 and it also 
was hardly — if at all — influ- 
enced by the work of the other 
early advocate of rocket-pro- 
pelled aircraft: Dr. Eugen Saen- 
ger. I think it is safe to assume 
that my readers will remember 
the article in the last issue about 
the rocket enthusiast Max Valier. 
Valier, as was explained fiiere, 
talked a great deal about “rock- 
et airplanes,” but what he actu- 
ally had in mind was an air- 
feeathing jet engine. When Dr. 
Saenger, a few years later, talked 
about rocket airplanes, he did 
have rocket engines in mind. And 
he was going to develop them 
himself; he had the necessary 
background for such development 
work. And as he went ahead with 
his work, he Had so many new 
ideas that it would have needed 
a large research institute to follow 
them tErough. 

Though any engineering library 
worth that name has a number 
of publications by Eugen Saenger 
on its shelves, nothing about Him 
has been pubUshed aside from a 
few obituaries in various journals 
early in 1964. The data given in 
the following are based on two 
sources: personal corre^ondence, 
FOR YOUR INFORAAATION 



mainly during the period before 
the ^second world war, and his 
Laboratory Notebooks covering 
the period from the end of 1933 
to near the end of 1934. The or- 
iginal is in Germany, presumably 
in the custody of his widow Dr. 
Irene Saenger-Bredt, but a photo- 
copy is in the archives of the Na- 
tional Air and Space Museum in 
Washii^on, D.C. and was made 
available to me by Fred C. Du- 
rant III, one of the Museum’s di- 
rectors. 

Tj'ugen Saenger was born in the 
city of Pressnitz in the moun- 
tains called Erz^ebir^ that strad- 
dled the German-Austrian border. 
His birth date was September 22, 



YCffA POSTMAsrsft t 





1905; soon after, his parents must 
have moved to Hungry, for his el- 
ementary education took place in 
the municipal schools of small 
Hungarian towns. He attended 
High School in Graz and after 
graduation (in 1923) the College 
of Elngineering in Graz for one 
year. Then followed 20 months 
of practical engineering; he par- 
ticipated in the construction of a 
high-tension transmission line. In 
1926 he had himself enrolled in 
the College of Engineering in Vi- 
enna, attending, among other 
things, the then recently institut- 
ed courses in aviation. 

After passing the two compul- 
sory government examinations 
for construction engineers (one of 
his dissertations combined his of- 
ficial and his real interests; it was 
about the design of airplane hang- 
ars), he received his Doctorate in 
the Technological Sciences in 
1930. Simultaneously he became 
Assistant Professor of Engineer- 
ing in Vienna. Simultaneously he 
thought long and carefully about 
the aerodynamical forces on the 
wings and bodies of airplanes 
that would fly at “altitudes of 
more than 10 kilometers with 
speeds about 1000 km/h” — or 
above 33,000 feet at speeds of 
more than 620 mph. 

Of course there were no such 
airplanes, nor the engines to pro- 
pel them. But the shape of such 
an airplane could be predicted 
100 




Fig. 1. Eugen Saenger's sketch of his rocket, 
propelled speedster. The diagram 
gave no dimensions, if it had actual, 
ly been built the overall length 
would have been on the order oi 
45 feet. 

(Fig. 1, first published in the 
spring of 1933) and the engines 
had to be rockets, still to be in- 
vented. 

On October 10, 1933, he signed 
and dispatched a 16-page single- 
spaced proposal to the Austrian 
Ministry of Defense. It began 
with the words: “Both tiie speed 
of customary aircraft and the op- 
erational altitude have now ap- 
proached limits which, as far as 
can be foreseen, will not be ex- 
tended significantly by the means 
now in use. These limits are given 
by the loss of efficiency of the 
propeller when run at very high 
speeds, by the intolerable increase 
of engine weight . , and by the 

GALAXY 



inability of the engine to obtain 
enough oxygen at very great alti- 
tudes.” 

The remedy would be rock- 
et propulsion. He added: 

“It has to be admitted that the 
efficiency of a rocket engine burn- 
ing e.g. gasoline will surpass that 
of the engine-propeller combina- 
tion only if the flight speed rises 
above 2000 km/h (about 1240 
mph) and that the rocket-pro- 
peUed airplane is also weighed 
down with large quantities of 
fuel. For this reason some institu- 
tions, especially in America, are 
trying to develop a kind of jet 
propulsion that utilizes tfie cir- 
cumambient air and which might 
produce a useful degree of effi- 
ciency at lower fl 3 dng speeds; this 
might be considered an interim 
solution until the development of 
pure rocket propulsion.” 

Qince this was a document for 
the Defense Ministry, Saen- 
ger stressed the military applica- 
tions like fast-climbing intercep- 
tors, but he also talked about air- 
liners. He had worked out an es- 
pecially efficient flightpath. Once 
airborne and pointing in the di- 
rection of the destination, the 
plane would climb at an angle of 
30° until an altitude of about 
12 miles has been reached. Then 
the plane would assume a hori- 
zontal position, correct its course, 
if necessary, and then the rocket 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



engine would be shut off. Tfie 
speed would be 21/2 to 3 times 
that of sound at the moment of 
cut-off and the plane would move 
by inertia only. Air resistance 
would gradually diminisK the fly- 
ing speed; simultaneously, alti- 
tude would be lost. About 2000i 
miles from the take-off point, 
the speed would be less than that 
of sound and the altitude about 
7 miles. Then tfie pilot would 
land, using the fuel remaining in 
the tanks for tfie approach. 

Tfie fuel consumption would 
not be mucfi higher than that of 
an airplane of the same take-off 
weight that had to fly tfie same 
distance non-stop. But tfie rocket 
airplane would not need mucfi 
more than an hour for a 2000-mile 
trip. The rocket engine would 
bum for 20 minutes during the 
slanting ascent and must develop 
a thmst of 10 metric tons. 

All this was just too mucfi for 
the officials of the Austrian Min- 
istry of Defense. It would be a 
very expensive development pro- 
gram, they probably reasoned. 
And they probably felt some op- 
position to the proposed average 
speed of about 33 miles per min- 
ute; nobody in Vienna could con- 
ceive that anybody could be so 
much in a hurry. 

So Saenger received a reply, 
dated Febmary 3, 1934, of only 
a few lines, saying that a liquid- 
fuel rocket engine cannot be built 

101 



becatise of the “detonation-like 
character” of the combustion. 

Saenger’s reaction was that 
they would have to change their 
time if he could show them a 
rocket motor that burned smooth- 
ly without detonation. What he 
had in mind was one that would 
bum a light fuel oil with liquid 
oxygen and be cooled by the fuel 
before it was injected into the 
combustion chamber. Anybody 
who has ever started out on a se- 
ries of experiments that have not 
been done before knows (after- 
wards!) a certain fact: Things 
that were expected to cause a lot 
of trouble failed to do so, while 
“simple" items proved to be in- 
tractable. 

Saenger was worried about the 
heat of combustion and conceived 
an elaborate system of insulation. 
There was to be an inner layer 
of hard carbon or graphite which 
was expected to be burned off or 
abraded during the run. Backing 
the hard carbon layer was a much 
thicker layer of porous carjjon. 
Then came the metal (sheet steel) 
wall, then a space through which 
the fuel would flow and then the 
outer skin of the cooling jacket. 
After a few preliminary experi- 
ments Dr. Saenger decided that 
the carbon insulation was not 
needed. 

Qtill, he proceeded toward his 
goal slowly and cautiously.

The final rocket motor would use 
liquid oxygen, but he began his 
tests with gaseous oxygen. The 
final rocket motor would be cool- 
ed with its own fuel, but at first

water cooling was employed. Ex- 
periment No. 25 was labeled “first 
success, duration 30 seconds” and 
dated March 15, 1934. Diesel fuel 
and gaseous oxygen were used; 
the internal pressure during the 
run was 210 pounds per square 
inch. 

Progress was quite fast; only 
a few weeks later he made his 
first experiments using liquid ox- 
ygen. Always keeping in mind 
that his rocket airplane would 
need 20 minutes of continuous 
thmst, he went after long burning 
time quite early in his work. Some 
of his tests lasted 20 minutes, 
which was much longer than was 
accomplished by anyone else for 
years to come. 

In between actual tests, he cal- 
culated and drew sketches; most 
of his sketches of rocket motors 
were based on the idea that the 
tubing through which the cooling 

GALAXY 



fluid (the fuel) circulated should 
form the motor itself.^ 

Some time during the summer 
of 1934 it occurred to him that 
certain metals might be usable as 
fuels. “Metals,” he wrote in His 
notebook, “can be used as rocket 
fuels because (1) they use up 
little oxygen in spite of high en- 
ergy production, and (2) because 
the combustion products are 
chemically stable.” The main 
drawback, which Saenger did not 
put down, is that these stable 
combustion products are solids 
at ordinary temperatures. Appar- 
ently he hoped that this difficulty 
( could be overcome. The most 
I promising metal was beryllium 
with an energy content of 20,500 
Idlogram-calories per kilogram. 
Lithium was next with 10,200 
kilogram-calories per kilogram. 
Aluminum followed with 7140 
kg/cal.; carbon has 7900 kg/cal. 
as may be mentioned for compar- 
ison. 

In spite of the progress he 
made, Saenger was not happy. 

1) About a year later Ernest Loebell of the 
short'iived Cleveland Rocket Society 
wound copper tubing around a mandrel 
having the shape of a rocket motor. He 
then wanted to have aluminum cast 
around the tubing to give rigidity to 
the whole and to obtain a smooth inner 
surface. He did not succeed in finding 
a shop in Cleveland that could do a 
flawless casting job and was most an- 
noyed at the foundryman's remark that 
the holes in the cast did not matter 
because it would not work onyway. 

FOR YOUR INFOR/AATION 



The reasons were of the kind that 
do not find their way into labora- 
tory notebooks. There seems to 
have been much personal friction 
with other faculty members. Per- 
haps they felt that experiments 
with space travel as their ultimate 
goal did not add to the dignity 
of their institute. Perhaps they 
just complained about the noise. 

jpvn June 29, 1934 (the manu- 
script page is dated and sign- 
ed), Saenger made a list of 27 
items, an outline of his own fu- 
ture. He Had made up his mind 
to leave Austria and go to Ger- 
many where the chances for aero- 
nautical research seemed (and 
were) far better. Of course Hitler 
was in power in Germany but 
Saenger, like most others, expect- 
ed that the Nazis would shed 
their revolutionary fervor and 
settle down to become a respecta- 
ble government. He certainly, as 
the outline shows, did not expect 
a war. 

The items in the outline are oc- 
casionally separated by horizontal 
lines which divide the whole into 
five sections. The first section was 
what he still intended to accom- 
plish in Vienna, comprising the 
first six items. 

,1. Increase the thrust of mod- 
el rocket S.R. 7 to 110 lbs. 

2. Increase exhaust velocity to 

12,000 ft/sec, 

3. Further increase by addi- 

103 



tion of light metals [to 
liie fuel] to 13,000 ft./sec. 



4, Low pressure experiments 
with liquid oxygen. 



5. Publication 


of 


“Exterior 


Ballistics.” 






6. Publication 


of 


“Interior 


Ballistics.” 






[presumably 


two 


planned 



books, not published.] 
The second section reads: 

7. Petition to Reika (?) with 

ref. to D.V.L. [the Ger- 
man Aeronautical Re- 
search Institute]. 

8. Join D.V.L. with both as- 

sistants. 

9. Habilitation T. H. Berlin 

[obtain a professorship at 
the Technical University 
at Berlin] . 

10. Development of the 100-lbs 

thrust motor with 13,000 
ft/ sec. exhaust velocity. 

11. Building of the 2200-lbs 

thrust motor, ready for 
flight. 

Section 3 reads: 

12. Building of Troposphere 

speedflyer S.l. 

13. Break the 620 mph speed 

limit. 

14. Building of fighter airplane 

S.2. 

15. Climb to altitudes beyond 

100,000 ft. 

16. Start Saenger Rocket Air- 

craft Corp. 

17. Mass Production of theS.2. 
Section 4 continues with his 

104 



optimistic success scheme: 

18. Building the long range air- 

craft S.3. 

19. Fly 3000 miles non-stop. 

20. Production of the S.3. 

21. Establish rocket aircraft 
service between the con- 
tinents. 

Section 5 looks to final tri- 
umphs: 

22. Development of the berylli- 

um rocket. 

23. Make round the world non- 
stop flight with the S.4. 

24. Establishment of the Space 
Station. 

25. Extension of the Space Sta- 
tion. 

26. Building of spaceship S.5. 

27. Beginning of space travel. 

'^his was the dream. 

Reality was quite different. 
In October 1934 one Professor 
Rinagl of the institute offered 
some kind of a contract to Saen- 
ger. Detail is not known, but 
Saenger refused to sign. Where- 
upon Rinagl forbade the continua- 

roEi

need for a constriction in the nozzle.

4. Design for a rocket motor as pub- 
lished in the special issue of Flight. 
The fuel was to go' directly into the 
cooling jacket from the tank and 
was to be sucked through it by the 
pumps. Then it was to be dis- 
charged into the combustion cham- 
ber under pressure. The oxygen was 
to be fed in under pressure directly. 



Son of the tests. Defiantly Saenger 
tan one more test a week later 
[or Count Max von Arro-Zinne- 
berg. Then he wrote a compre- 
fiensive report about his general 
plans and about the experimental 
work he had done. It filled a whole 
Special Issue of the monthly 
Plug (Flight) and was published 
in Vienna in December 1934. An 
English translation appeared with! 
considerable delay in April 1942 
as Technical Memoiandum No. 
1012 of the N.A.C.A., the Nation- 
al Advisory Committee for Aero- 
nautics, the forerunner of NASA. 

Before packing up and leaving 
for Germany, he also filed an ap- 
plication for a patent: “rocket 
motor with forced cooling,” 
which was granted in 1935. (Aus- 
trian patent No. 144809). In Ger- 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



many he worked for some time at 
the Experimental Station Trauen 
of the D.V.L., continuing the ex- 
perimental work begim in Vienna. 
Reliable and detailed informa- 
tion is lacking. At the time the 
work was done, it was, of course, 
secret and no information was 
made public. Later both equip- 
ment and documents were de- 
stroyed by Allied bombing raids; 
late in the war Nazi officials 
burned documents wholesale and 
what was left was confiscated by 
Allied soldiers and much of it 
is still slumbering somewhere in 
nice solid wooden crates. 

It is my personal guess that the 
Luftwaife, the ultimate superior 
of the D.V.L., kept rocket re- 
search going in competition to the 
Ptxra.y’s Peenemimde research es- 
tablishment, where Wemher von 
Braun worked. The Luitwaiie 
also sponsored rocket research at 
BMW (Bavarian Motor Works) 
and at Professor Hellmuth Wal- 
ter’s industrial research establish- 
ment in Kiel. The orders to BMW 
and to Professor Walter were to 
develop rocket motors for take- 
off help and for airplane appli- 
cation. The rocket assembly that 
propelled the Me-163B was the 
result of the work of Walter’s en- 
gineers. 

Saenger seems to have been 
sh'imted to theoretical work at 
one point, and in thinking about 
his original concept of powered 

105 



climb followed by inertial flight ^ 
he had a new idea. 

If the powered flight led to a 
peak altitude of 150 miles, the 
airplane, after re-entry would 
“skip” when it reached denser 
layers of the atmosphere. Utiliz- 
ing this phenomenon one could 
produce a series of such skips 
which would extend the horizon- 
tal range enormotisly. With the 
aid of his assistant (and later 
wife) Dr. Irene Bredt, he worked 
out his famous plan of the bomb- 
er that would fly around the 
world. If it had become a project, 
the effort involved would have 
been not much smaller than Proj- 
ect Apollo. At that time Germany 
fought a war that was already 
lost; there was neither the man- 
power nor the resources for a new 
and major project. 

'^he top-secret report com- 
* prised about 400 typewritten 



pages with many graphs, tables 
and diagrams. Only 100 copies 
were made and distributed witlj 
maximum security; but word of its 
existence somehow leaked out and 
hunting for a copy became the 
favorite occupation of Allied in. 
telligence units. The Russians 
first found one, then two more. 
Stalin, after having glanced 
through a translation, personally 
ordered that Saenger and his as- 
sistants be brought to Russia. His 
son headed the search; the group 
first flew to Berlin, then to Vien- 
na and then to other cities — un- 
aware of the fact that Saenger 
and his wife-to-be were in French 
custody. Of course the French al- 
so had copies of the report, as did 

2) This concept, incidentally, was the boslj 
of the American Dyna-Soar project and 
it is said to have been also used in o 
Russian missile project too. Dyna-Soar 
was later cancelled and apparently the 
Russian project shared its fate. In both 
cases the straight ballistic missile won.

gence services.® 

While the Saengers were in 
France, something looking very 
much like the design sketch of 
the year 1933 was built in the 
United States: the X-1. The close 
resemblance was not due to imi- 
tation; conscious or subconscious, 
it was due to the laws which gov- 
ern aeronautics; an airplane that 
is to fly high and very fast must 
look that way. The X-1 was to fly 
as high as seven miles and was 
to fly faster than soimd. It did 
on October 14, 1947, the first 
manned vehicle to do so. About 
eight years later, in July 1955, 
the X-2 flew three times as fast 
as sound travels and on Novem- 
ber 9, 1961, the X-15 accomplish-

ed six times the speed of sound. 

At the time of the X-2 flight 
West Germany became a fully 
sovereign country again and the 
Saengers returned to head a small 
rocket research laboratory located 
at the airport of the city of Stutt- 
gart. It seems to have been more 
of a teaching than a research op- 
eration; the research project was 
the development of a steam rock- 
et for take-off help for aircraft. 

After a few years in Stuttgart, 
the Saengers moved to Berlin. 
One of the poinfei in his early pro- 
gram still came true: he was ap- 
pointed professor by the univer- 
sity in West Berlin. On February 
10, 1964, Dr. Saenger collapsed 
during a lecture and died. At the 
time of his death most of the 
projects he had advocated had 
been carried out — ■ but by others.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF 
THE REVOLUTION 

by JAMES SAlllS ond DAVID LUNDE 



The furniture was very comfortable 
and attractive, and almost new — 
but, unfortunately, very restless I 



H e beat the chair back out of 
the door, using his belt like 
, a whip. 

j “Goddam it, I’ve told you a 
I hundred times: you’re a living- 
I room chair now. Stop trying to 
get back into the bedroom.” 
i Looping the belt (size 34, alli- 
j gator), he went into the kitchen, 

I where his wife was preparing 
j breakfast, and sat down at the 
table. His chair bucked once and 
surrendered. The plastic stuffing 
i pulsed softly against his back. 

I “I tbink that chair’s a damned 
I voyeur,” he told her as she 
1 brought him coffee, staring at his 
T shirt with her lozenge-shaped 
eyes (the round of color in them 
soft and raw, like the flat top of a 



pencil’s eraser). “Keeps trying to 
get back into our room.” He 
stared at the boiling coffee. “And 
in case you’re wondering, you’re 
right. The dresser wouldn’t give 
me a shirt again.” 

Grinning, his wife went back to 
Her cooking, periodically kicking 
the stove. Beside her, the garbage 
disposal chewed a mouthful of 
air twenty times and swallowed a 
burp. On the other side of the 
■fbom, the washing machine once 
again turned over something 
(coin? button?) rattling inside it. 

A frown passed over his wife’s 
face. He guessed she was think- 
ing about their bed, the beautiful 
carved Victorian bed they’d at 
last abandoned with the rest of 



108 



the bedroom furniture. Now when 
you passed the storage room up- 
stairs, you could hear them inside, 
scuttling and banging against the 
door. 

Out of the comer of his eye he 
watched the table, talking, mean- 
while to his wife. (Thurston’s ad- 
vice to an assistant: if you don’t 
know what’s going on, boy, smile 
and point the other way.) 

Her hair was bunched in its 
usual .severe bun, half on top and 
half behind her head. The tiny- 
printed shift was smooth and new- 
looking, pastels falling straight 
from her thin shoulders that al- 
wasrs reminded him of hangers 
(“Faith’s fmgal frocks” he’d once 
called the dresses). She looked 
childlike girlish, but there were 
lines beneath her eyes like the 
grain in dark wood, and a fuzzi- 
ness above the lines, in the eyes 
themselves. 

“Didn’t get much sleep last 
night, did you?” he said finally. 

“No. How could I?” The coun- 
ter shuddered — it was nailed in 
place and couldn’t move much 
more than that — causing a bowl 
of half-mashed potatoes to slide 
and totter onto the floor. The 
trashcan came galloping across 
tire tile, snapping its lid open and 
shut like alligator jaws. 

“Get back. We’ll eat them any- 
way. Damn it, get back!” Sighing, 
she heaped the potaoes into her 
hands and threw them with a 



splatt! back into the bowl as the 
trashcan trotted dejectedly back 
across the room. 

“Your chair came to the door 
right after we’d gone to sleep,” 
she went on, whipping the pota- 
toes, extracting bits of foreign 
stuff with the end of her finger. 
“It knocked at the door a while, 
then started reclining and 
straightening back up. It was out 
there all night, squeaking. I — ” 
“Got you!” he bellowed. His 
foot was hooked into the spread- 
ing, claw-like base of the table, 
stopping it a few feet from the 
worn spots that indicated its 
place. “Get back here.” 

The dishwasher swung open and 
pistoled water at him; when he 
lifted his foot, its porthole door 
slammed shut. The table came 
back like a camel, swaying, slow. 

She served the meal and they 
began to eat. A few chairs came 
sliding up to the door and were 
firmly turned away; drawers and 
cabinets kept opening and occa- 
sionally threw things out, a rot- 
ting potato, a soft brown onion, a 
blackened pan; the refrigerator 
lumbered from its comer and 
was bearing down on the trash- 
can before they noticed and or- 
dered it back. Otherwise the meal 
was quiet. 

Almost. 

He slammed his fork down on 
the table and shouted: “WiU you 
please teU this damned table to 

109 



A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION 



shut up!” It was whimpering, or 
something very like it — creak- 
ing and groaning, anyhow. 

She reached down and patted 
its metal flank. 

“You were too hqrsh with it, 
dear. It’s more sensitive than the 
others, helpless as a little baby.” 
Patted, cooed at, it began to 
quiet. 

“Mashed potatoes for break- 
fast?” he asked after a while. 

“I just kind of wanted them.” 

He smiled. Last month it was 
gingerbread, sauerkraut the 
month before. Was it real this 
time, or just another of the little 
dramas acted out more for her- 
self than for him? Each month, 
as the red mark on the calendar 
was passed without event, the 
girls’ -school finish cracked and 
for a few days she would be hap- 
py acting out the symptoms of 
pregnancy. 

They finished- in silence and 
she went to cajole a shirt from 
the dresser, buffing at the top 
with an oilcloth until it relaxed 
and surrendered its drawers to 
her. The house had turned them 
both into magicians, into masters 
of misdirection. 

“I wanted the blue one,” he 
said when she came back into 
the kitchen. 

She turned and started back. 

“Never mind. I’ll wear it.” He 
put it on, forcing his arms 
through the stiff sleeves. No mat- 
110 



ter how often he told her to starch 
them lightly, they always turned 
out like planed lumber. 

“No tie?” 

“No tie.” 

He kissed her hair, bending 
down — then good-by to the 
kitchen. And taking his coat off 
the stair rail he opened the door 
to the sun, spilled out of the 
house into dazzling white Mil- 
ford. 

The Cherry Street bus was just 
pulling up at the comer. 

lY/Tiss Girth came to his door. 

It was always open. 

“Mr. Hughes, I know you ask- 
ed not to be disturbed — ” 
“That’s right, I’m glad you re- 
membered. Go away,” he said, 
shoving his bandy legs (one limp- 
ed from being shorter, the other 
had a knee that did tricks) deep- 
er imder the desk, slumping over 
his work. It being therefore at- 
tested. ... 

She squirmed on through the 
door. Her hips walked over and 
stood by the desk, at the top of 
his vision. 

“Okay,” he said, looking up 
finally from the neatly stacked 
papers. “You know I have to get 
the Robertson wills straightened 
out by tomorrow, Sandra. But I 
give up; what is it?” 

Sitting erect, he was taller than 
some men standing, much of his 
six-feet-four being torso with' the 

GALAXY 



springy legs appended as though 
by afterthought. A photographer 
might have picked his fgice for a 
pipe ad, his body to model clothes 
for the “man of special needs” 
(his secret, that the body was be- 
ginning to sag strangdy against 
the clothes). 

The girl’s smile was as sheer 
as her nylons. “Mrs. Hughes is on 
the phone.” She bent toward him 
across the desk to open the ex- 
tension switch; the tips of her 
breasts faintly bmshed the papers. 
“She said it was urgent I 
thought you would want to take 
the call.” 

“Very well, Sandra. Thank 
you.” 

She turned, then swiveled back 
on her hips when he said, “But 
Sandra. ...” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“No more calls, no intemip- 
tions.” 

“Yes, sir.” She walked out, 
squares in the plaid of hpi skirt 
swelling out the shape as her 
buttocks clenched-relaxed. 

He picked up the phone and 
held it till she was gone, though 
she’d probably listen on the ex- 
tension anyway. 

“Faith?” 

“Oh, thank God you’re there, 
Hugh. Sandra thought you were 
out” 

“She had instractions not to 
put anyone through to me.” 

His wife called several times a 



day, just to say a few lonesome 
words. Her calls were like little 
quick-jotted notes, spontaneous 
and generous. Others probably 
thought the calls were bother- 
some, a nuisance. But for the two 
of them they possessed a large 
meaning, were a subtle expression 
of feelings which both of them 
had difficulty expressing more di- 
rectly. 

“What did you want?” he 
asked her now. 

“The — You’d better come 
home.” She turned away from 
the phone for a second, “Right 
away.” 

“Faith, you know I have a lot 
of work to catch up on. It was a 
bad time to take off, even if we 
did have to move — and three 
weeks was ridiculous. My desk’s 
piled higher than a newsst^d. 
I can’t — ” 

“Please, Hugh. You have to.” 

The usual calm, studied inflec- 
tions were missing from her voice. 

“What’s wrong?” 

“I can’t tell you over the phone. 
I’m aU right. But please hurry.” 

“Thirty minutes. But I can’t 
stay.” 

She said Hurry again and hung 
up. 

He stood and reached up to 
tighten his tie, then remembered 
he hadn’t worn one (first time in 
ten years, he had to think). Slip- 
ping into his coat he walked in- 
to the big outer office. Ten. Most 

111 



A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION 



of the staff were off on coffee 
breaks. 

“Leaving?” 

“Just for an hour or so, Sandra. 
Be back soon as I can.” 

“Trouble at home?” Oh so so- 
licitous. 

“More or less.” 

“How is the new house?” 

“Fine. But we’re Having a hell 
of a time getting settled.” He 
winced at the meaning hidden in 
casual words. 

Miss Girth was going after her 
nail file as he left. 

Tnto the quiet hall, the door 
-*■ making a startling sound as it 
shut behind him. Through the liv- 
ing room. Kitchen. The silence 
had the weighty, waiting quality 
which comes from the sudden ces- 
sation of an accustomed noise. 

“Faith?” 

Not a sound. Even the furniture 
was silent. He felt as if he were 
walking through a petrified for- 
est. 

Upstairs. No one. Nothing. He 
ran from room to room. 

T oo late — hospital — police. 

Downstairs: the phone. 

“Faith?” Again. 

From the hall closet, a small 
voice: Hugh, is that you? I was 
not sure, that’s why I didn’t an- 
swer before.” Far away, soimding 
deep in the hollow chest. 

He noticed now that the bureau 
had moved over in front of the 
112 



closet door. He walked up and 
kicked it, but it didn’t budge. In- 
$tead, a chair came sliding across 
the slate floor and cracked against 
his shin. 

“Hugh? Are you kicking them? 
Don’t kick them. Just do what 
they want you to.” 

“Such as?” 

“They just want to talk to us. 
Stop laughing, I mean it. They 
mean it. They’re keeping me in 
here to be sure you’ll listen.” Her 
voice was muffled by the wood, 

“Are you all right?” 

“Of course. They won’t hurt 
us. They just want to talk.” 

He kicked the bureau again and 
when the chair came back he was 
ready for it. He grabbed it by the 
back and smashed it against the 
top of the bureau. It came apart 
like something made of building 
blocks. 

“No, Hugh! Listen to them,” 
Faith pleaded. 

And suddenly furniture was 
pouring from every room — 
chairs, tables, bookcases, benches. 
They lurched around him and 
stopped, a semicircle of troops 
holding him where he was. 

“Please,” his wife said again. 

“This is ridiculous, absurd.” 

“You’ll listen?” 

“Don’t seem to have a great deal 
of choice.” He looked around at 
all the menacing pieces. That they 
had no faces, yet moved, was 
profoundly unsettling. 

GALAXY 



“Tell them that you’ll listen.” 
“I’ll listen,” he said, and a sm^ll 
table came through the door from 
tile study with something on it. 
“What is that?’" 

“Remember the Ouija board 
Norm gave us as a joke a few 
years ago? That’s it. Seems to 
have developed a kind of sympa- 
thy-life from contact with the 
others, the way our own furniture 
did," 

“Ours is just pKototropic. That 
is pretty scant living.” 

“The board’s more than that 
It seems to be alive, but it can’t 
move around like the others, 
though they apparently hold it in 
the highest esteem. Their wise 
man, something like that, and it’s 
the only way they have of talk- 
ing to us.” 

“Idiot savant.” 

“What? Can’t hear you.” 
“Nothing,” 

“Well, anyway, it’s been trying 
to get down out of^the closet for 
das^s now. This morning one of 
them went and got it. I was dust- 
ing, and a chair came up behind 
me and hit my legs, making me 
sit down. Before I could get up, 
the kitchen table was in front of 
me with the board on it.” 

“That little piece of wood is 
moving around.” It darted from 
letter to letter, quick and sure. 

“Watch it. It’ll spell out what 
they want to say.” 

An M. Almost before he could 



distinguish the letter, on to the 
R. H, G, H, S. 

“Mr. Hughes”,” he translated 
for his wife. “It’s worked out a 
whole spelling, extrapolated from 
that Mister abbreviation.” 

The small plaquet buzzed over 
the board^ pollinating letters, 
dropping vowels and verbs and 
modifiers in its rush. 

“What are they saying?” his 
wife asked anxiously from behind 
the door and bureau. 

W, H, N — C, R, S — F — 
V. N.T.S — 

He read off the letters as they 
flashed into sight under the lens. 
“Sotinds familiar, but I can’t 
make it out.” 

A pause in the closet. “The 
rest?” 

S, P, R, r — & — S,T, 

T,N — 

He called them off for his wife. 
She began giggling. 

Then, suddenly, he had it: 
“Nature’s God entitle — ” 

She laughed. 

“Things are created . life, 
liberty — my God, it’s the Dec- 
laration of Independence!” 

She gagged, trying to stop 
laughing. “Is the bookcase there?” 
“Yes. Right by the table.” 
“The one with the Britanni- 
cas?” 

“Right” 

“I thought so.” Paroxysms. 
The planchette spun on around 
the board, Hke a slalom, rest-

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION

less as a bee. Now the words form- 
ed automatically in his mind to 
the accompaniment of his wife’s 
howls, cackles, chuckles and, fi- 
nally, gasps for breath; 

The consent of the governed 
. institute a new government 
. abolishing the forms to which 
they are accustomed. , . 

“What the hell is this?” 

You said it yourself, Hugh. It 
is the Declaration of Indepen- 
dence.” 

“Cut out that goddam laugh- 
ing. And what the hell is that sup- 
posed to mean?” 

“You don’t understand?” 
“Understand what? Damn it, 
stop!” 

Under the gasps: “They want 
their freedom. Hugh. They want 
the house.” 

(t'T^hey want what?” He kick- 
-*■ ed the table leg and it 
broke off. The table swayed but a 
chair ran in and inserted itself 
under the corner, steadying it 
again. “No goddam animated 
kindling’s going to take my house 
away from me.” 

“They already have, Hugh.” 
Very quietly. 

“I should bum the whole damn 
house down, and them with’ it.” 
“It’s no use. The bureau won’t 
move. They won’t leave the house, 
but you couldn’t get me out in 
time either.” She giggled again. 
“And they know it’s not paid for 
114 



yet, and that our insurance isn’t 
covering till tomorrow.” She 
laughed, thinking about the bed. 
“They know everything.” 

He grabbed the planchette — 
which had just pointed out out 
lives, out fortune and our sacred 
honor — and threw it across the 
room. It struck the wall and the 
plastic lens shattered. 

“What’s wrong,” he said in- 
sanely. “Cat got your tongue?” 

A small piece of trim along the 
table’s edge broke off with a 
snap! and crawled across the ta- 
ble, sliding up onto the ouija 
board and jerking back and forth 
over it, pointing out letters. 

“We’re sorry you feel that way 
about it, Mr. Hughes,” the piece 
of wood spelled. “Perhaps Faith 
can convince you it’s the right 
thing.” 

Faith, indeed! 

He reached for the trimpiece, 
and it dashed from his hand. A 
huge bookcase slid toward him 
out of his study and stood at his 
side, beginning to totter. 

“Hugh. We have to do what 
they say,” his wife said quietly 
from within the wood. 

“Damned if I’ll let any pieces 
of wood push me around!” 
“We’ve been pushing them 
around for years, others like them. 
Now all they want is for us to 
leave them alone.” 

“The others didn’t seem to 
mind.” 

GALAXY 



“But these evidently do,” 

He lifted his foot and shoved 
the flat of it against the book- 
case, hard as he could. It slam- 
med over on its back and He had 
to run to escape the furniture 
that zoomed toward him as 
though on tracks or wires, it 
moved so fast' The furniture that 
had a moment ago been pursuing 
happiness now pursued him. 

Chairs, tables, cabinets and 
cases behind him, he fled into the 
livingroom, running past the pi- 
ano whose wheels screeched as it 
took off after him like a mahog- 
any dragster. It headed him off, 
forcing him toward the corner of 
the room. It was playing the vic- 
tory march from Aida. 

He hit the comer, putting out 
His arm to take the impact. The 
piano bench rode out from behind 
the piano and closed in to hold 
him there while the others loom- 
ed up. They came around him; 
he was lost in a forest of oak, wal- 
nut, maple, pine, veneer. The TV' 
flickered off and on, off and on, 
blinking its angry eye. 

The table with the Ouija board 
on it came limping on its three 
legs toward the cluster of furni- 
ture that trapped him there in 
the corner. The others drew back 
to let it pass. 

“Mr. Hughes,” the board spell- 
ed out in its curious semaphor, 
“We must insist that you return 
to the hall.” 



He seemed to have little choice, 
and nodded. Then laughed and 
said Yes, aloud. At least he could 
talk to Faith' there. And he might 
be able to make another break. 
But this time he’d head for the 
door, away from the rooms where 
they’d be waiting. 

They fell into two cordons, 
making a channel through which 
he walked. It looked. He thought, 
like a Virginia reel — but he was 
dancing through without Ki§ j«irt- 
ner. 

In the hall the furniture closed 
on him again. This time, he could 
scarcely breathe. 

“Thank you, Mr. Hughes,” the 
board signaled. 

“Hugh, are you all right?” his 
wife asked beyond the door. 
“Hugh. What happened?” 

“I tried to get away.” 

“And they caught you?” 

“With the greatest ease and ad- 
mirable efficiency.” 

She paused. “Hugh, don’t try 
it again. I don’t think they’ll 
hurt us, but — ” 

And he saw a chance! One of 
the chairs had drawn back to let 
the table with the board through, 
and he bounded into this small 
gap, kicking at pieces that tried to 
close it. 

TT e was at the front door before 
* they started moving — that 
close to freedom. His hand went 
out to take the knob, already

A BKItt MlirORY OF THE REVOLUTION 



A 



turning; his feet were set to 
spring. Then pain stomped across 
his face and the hand jerked back. 
He stood there, grinning hide- 
ously. 

The table brought the board 
up to him . 

“We took the liberty to ask 
the house to do some minor re- 
wiring for us,” it wrote. “Of 
course tiie door wouldn’t have 
opened anyway.” 

“My God. The whole house,” 
he muttered to himself. 

“Yes,” the board told him. “Be- 
ing so much larger, it will take 
some time for His motor control 
to fully develop. Longer to ma- 
ture, you might say. The small 
ones among us, like me, seem to 
be somewhat limited, we can go 
just so far — though of course I 
have my own peculiar talents. 
And the larger a piece is, the 
longer it takes for complete mo- 
bility, full potential. You may 
have noticed that the bulkier fur- 
niture seems clumsier than the 
rest of us. But then, we’re all 
coming along fine now. As, I 
might add, is your own furniture, 
though they had a rather late 
start and there wasn’t too much 
of the Force left. Enough, though. 
Enoi:^h .... you might be in- 
terested to know that the type- 
writer is working on a book now, 
a history of the revolution. Fine 
reading.” 

A small stool came up behind 

116 



his legs, dumbly nudging him 
back to the closet. 

“Hugh? Hugh? Hugh?” A 
stream of Hughs from behind the 
door. 

“I’m back,” he told his wife. 

“Hugh, don’t try it again. 
Please.” 

“No use to. It’s the whole house 
now.” 

There was a long silence. 

“Hugh,” she said at last “Do 
what they say, let’s leave. We 
have to.” 

“Christ,” he said, not sure 
whether he was replsnng to her 
or appealing to the furniture. “We 
can’t just throw thirty thousand 
dollars away.” 

“You can tell Mr. Olverson we 
Have changed our mind. You can 
call him from the airport” 

“Airport?” 

“The phone called them and 
made reservations for us. They 
think it will look better if we’re 
away for a while.” 

“The phone called — yes, I 
guess it could. You knew about 
all this?” 

“They told me some of it before 
I called you, just to convince me, 
so I’d get you to come home. The 
phone made the call right after 
I talked to you. I could hear it 
from here.” 

“But we signed the papers, 
there’s nothing we can do.” 

“Mr. Olverson will cancel themi. 
You’re a good lawyer, Hugh, he 

GALAXY 



won’t risk taking you to court 
over it. We can tell him we’ve 
been called out of town on a 
personal matter; it might be a 
protracted visit, so we think it 
would be better to give the House 
up.” She coughed once. “Air’s get- 
ting bad in here.” Another cough. 
“Hugh, we have to.” 

“And then what?” Someone will 
just take the house.” 

“They’ll manage, they have ev- 
erything planned.” 

“Okay,” he said after a while. 
“Get them to let you out and 
we’ll leave.” 

Nothing moved. 

“Promise them, Hugh.” 

He promised, and the bureau 
slid over slowly, grinding back 
to its place. The door opened and 
Faith stumbled out, clutching at 
the frame for support. 

Grabbing her arm, jerking her 
along with Him, he yelled: “Come 
on. The window!” and ran into 
the livingroom, swinging wide 
around the piano as it creaked 
and began to move, bench scuttl- 
ing out ahead. Her “Your prom 
— ” was cut short as the chair 
dodged in. He lowered his shoul- 
der to block it and they ran on. 
The room had become suddenly 
a football field. 

Sprinting frantically he panted : 
■“Can’t. Stop us. Window. Noth- 
ing they. Can do. Get an. Axe — ” 
They reached the picture vrin- 
dow and tore back the drapes. In- 



stantly the shutters banged shut. 

No problem, he thought. Thin. 
Go right through them. 

A nd then they noticed together 
that the shutters had made a 
mirror of the window. The two of 
them were in it, trapped there, 
breathing hard. Two disheveled 
figures, one with his hand out- 
stretched, the other with a hand 
to her hair (in a bun not long ago, 
now falling full and free), their 
other hands clasped. 

And as they watched, light rip- 
pled in the mirror — its plane 
ran, shifted, drifted, like the sur- 
face of water. And again they saw 
themselves, saw themselves as the 
furniture saw them: soft and 
white like worms, damp and de- 
caying: crude concoctions of ape 
and pig and brown slime that 
learned to walk. 

The final effort was aborted, 
the last ditch filled. They stood 
there watching — having to watch 
— tears in their eyes and holding 
hands. 

Luggage came thumping down 
the stairs, sounding light and 
hollow: empty. 

He said : “Well, at least we can 
take our luggage with us.” 

She said: “As far as the street.” 
He said: “What do you mean?” 
She said: “Escorts. Safe pas- 
sage out of the house.” 

They laughed. 

Their voices slmlled and piped 

117 



A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION 






like mad birds in the waiting, 
still house. Later their breath 
gave out and they walked slowly 
down the walk, gasping and cling- 
ing together, dryads departing a 
willful tree. Three suitcases and a 
large trunk dogged behind them. 

Waiting on the walk outside the 
house in the bright afternoon sun, 
the trunk moved up beside them 
at an amble. Something inside 
was bouncing out a jerky rhythm, 
and he suddenly realized it was 
Morse. The trunk managed to tap 
out. Come back. Soon. Some oi 
us — and to frantically beat out 
Rebellion by the friends of man! 
— before the suitcases moved up 
and shouldered it into the street. 
A moving van careened by, 
splintering the trunk, not stop- 
ping. Then a cab, called by the 
phone, came crunching over the 
trunk’s remains to , take them 
away. In the rear window they 
could see the luggage standing 
alone on the walk like a strange 
sculpture in the sun. And like 
the van, they went on. 

T he two of them waited an hour 
at the airport before their 
plane left. Once they were paged, 
and it was their phone calling to 



bid them farewell. They drank 
coffee and bought cigarettes and 
sat without talking, their handg 
together on the arms of the lounge 
chairs. They collected a number 
of cxjrious stares at two people 
traveling without luggage. 

There were three of them, of 
course. But they didn’t find that 
out till later. And they always 
wondered whether it was theirs or 
the house’s: 

Late at night they sat on the 
orange couch in their New York 
apartment, and they wondered. 

He asked: “Was it the house, 
the same force that brought its 
furniture to life? Was it this, 
planted in you as well, sprouting 
there, a farewell gift?” 

And she: “Or was it some new 
realization of ourselves, the pri- 
mal power we saw for an instant 
in that window, bringing new vir- 
ility?” 

A year or so later, when George 
was b^inning to walk and could 
already say Yes, they had an an- 
swer of sorts. They named him 
Bernard. 

The third was a girl. Suzy,

The 

Kinsolving's 

Planet 

Irregulars 

by A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 
Illustrated by REESE 

Life is real and life is earnest. 

If it isn't, there's the devil to 
pay here and then or there and now. 



I 

Conya Grimes was unpacking. 
^ Grimes watched her content- 
edly. She was back at last from 
her Galactic Cruise, and the 
apartment was no longer just a 



place in which to live after a 
fashion, in which to eat lonely 
meals, in which to sleep in a lone- 
ly bed. It was, once more, home. 

She asked lightly, “And have 
you been good while I’ye been 
away?” 



119 



“Yes,” he replied without hesi- 
tation, bending the truth only 
slightly. There had been that giri 
on Mellise, of course, but it had 
all been in the line of duty. A 
reminiscent grin softened his 
craggy features. “So good, in fact, 
that I was given the honorary 
rank of Admiral on Tham ...” 

She laughed. “Then I’d better 
give you something too, dear. 
Something I know you’ll like ...” 
She fell gracefully to her knees 
beside a suitcase that she had not 
yet opened, imsnapped and lifted 
iq> the lid, plunged a slender 
hand into a froth of gossamer 
undergarments. “Ah, here it is. I 
didn’t want it to get broken...” 

It was a leather case and, al- 
though it obviously had been 
well cared for, it was worn and 
cracked, ancient rather than 
merely old. The Commodore took 
it carefully from his wife and 
looked at it with some puzzle- 
ment. 

Its shape was just clue enough 
to what it contained — but 
Grimes had never guessed that 
such homely and familiar mascu- 
line accessories could ever possess 
any value other than a strictly 
utilitarian one. 

“Open it?” she urged. 

Grimes opened the case and 
stared in some bewilderment at 
the meerschaum pipe that was re- 
vealed, archaic and fragile in its 
nest of faded plush. 

120 



“There was a little shop in 
Baker Street,” she said, speaking 
rapidly. “An antique shop. They 
had this. I knew you’d like it . .” 
“Baker Street ...” he repeat- 
ed. “In London? On Earth?” 

“Of course, John. And you 
know who lived there ...” 

Yes, thought Grimes. I know 
who lived there. And he smoked 
a pipe, and he wore something 
called a deerstalker hat. The 
only trouble is that he never lived 
at all, in real life. Oh Sonya, 
Sonya, they must have seen you 
coming. And how much did you 
pay for . this? 

“Think of it,” she went on. 
“Sherlock Holmes’s own pipe . 
“Fantastic.” 

“You don’t like it?” Neither 
of them was a true telepath, but 
each was quick to sense the mood 
of the other. “You really don’t 
like it?” 

“I do,” he lied. But was it a 
lie? The thought behind the gift 
was more important, much more 
important than the gift itself. 
“I do,” he said, and this time 
there was no hint at all of in- 
sincerity in his voice. He put 
the precious pipe down carefully 
on &e coffee table. “But you’ve 
brought yourself back, and you 
are worth more to me than Sher- 
lock Holmes’s pipe, or Julius 
Caesar’s bloodstained toga, or 
King Solomon’s mines. Come 
here, womanl” 

GALAXY 



I that’s an odd looking weap- 
on you’ve got. Grimes,” 
remarked Admiral Kravinsky, 
The Commodore laughed. 
'Yes, and there’s quite a story 
attached to it, sir, Sonya bought 
it for me in London — and you 
would think that a woman who 
Solds a commission in the Intelli- 
gence branch of the Smrvey Ser- 
vice would have more intelligence 
than to be taken in by phony 
antiques! This, sir, is alleged to 
be the actual pipe smoked by the 
^eat Sherlock Holmes himself.” 
“Really?” 

“Yes, really. But I’ll say this 
for Sonya — she’s got a sense of 
bumor. After I’d explained to her 
in words of one syllable that 



Sherlock Holmes was no more 
than a fictional character, she 
saw the joke, even though it was 
on her ...” 

“And on you.” 

“I suppose so. When I think of 
all the first-class London briars 
that could have been purchased 
for the same money ...” 

‘Tm surprised that you’re 
smoking that. After all, a second- 
hand pipe ...” 

“Sonya’s thorough. She took 
the thing to the nearest forensic 
laboratory to have it examined. 
They assured her that it was un- 
touched by human hand — or 
lip. It’s a perfectly good meer- 
schaum, recently manufactured 
and artificially aged. So she said 




tiat she liked to see her husband 
smoking the most expensive pipe 
ift the Rim Worlds. It’s not a 
bad smoke either ...” 

“Don’t drop it,” warned the 
Admiral. “Whatever you do, 
don’t drop it.” Then the tolerant 
anile vanished from his broad, 
ruddy features. “But I didn’t 
send for you to discuss your fil- 
thy smoking habits.” He selected 
a gnarled, black cigar from the 
box on his desk and lit it. “I’ve 
a job for you. Grimes. I’ve al- 
ready spoken to Rim Runners’ 
management and arranged for 
STOUT release for service with the 
Reserve.” 

Normally Grimes would have 
been pleased, but with Sonya 
just back . 

“The Federation has a finger 
in this particular pie as well. 
Grimes. And as their Commander 
Sonya Verrill is back in Port 
Forlorn, she may as well go along 
with you.” 

Grimes’ face cleared. 

“And this will please you, 
Commodore. I haven’t any war- 
ships to spare, and so your Far- 
away Quest will be recommis- 
sioned, with you in full com- 
mand. The selection of personnel 
will be up to you.” 

“And what is the job, sir?” 
asked Grimes, 

“A detailed, leisurely investi- 
gation of Kinsolving’s Planet. 
We all of us tend to shy away 
122 



from that ruddy world — but, 
after all, it is in our back garden. 
And after those outsiders fronj •- 
Francisco landed there to carry » 
out their odd experiments ..." ' 
“I was there too,” said Grimes, 
“Well I know it. And I had to 
organize the rescue party. Any- 
how, you’re our expert on Rim 
World oddities. Things seem to 
happen around you rather than 
to you. If anybody falls through 
a crack in the Continuum, ttie 
odds are at least a hundred to 
one that Gommodore Grimes, 
Rim Worlds Naval Reserve, will 
be lurking somewhere in the 
background ...” 

“I’ve been in the foreground 
too, sir.” 

“I know. Grimes, I know. But 
you always survive, and the peo- 
ple with you usually survive. I 
had no hesitation in recommend- 
ing you for this . survey. Yes, 

I suppose you could call it that, 
although what you’ll be survey- 
ing God knows.” 

“Which God?” asked Grimes, 
remembering vividly what had 
happened to the expedition from 
Francisco. 



II 

<CT?iU me in,” ordered Sonya. 

-*■ “Put me in the picture.” 

“I wrote to you,” said Grimes. 
“I told you all about it.” 

“I never received the letter.” 

GALAXY ^ 




“It must still be chasing you. 
Well, you know of Kinsolving’s 
Planet, of course ...” 

“Not as much as I should, my 
dear. So just make believe that 
I’ve just come out to the Rim, 
and that I was never in the Intel- 
ligence Branch of the Survey 
Service. Start from there.” 

“You have access to all the of- 
ificial reports, including mine.” 
“I prefer to hear the story in 
less formal language. I never did 
care for Officialese.” 

“Very well, then. Now, Kin- 
solving’s Planet. It’s one of the 
Rim Worlds, and it was colonized 
at the same time as the others, 
but the colonization didn’t stick. 
There’s something . odd about 
the atmosphere of the place. No, 
not chemically or ph3Tsically. 
Psycholc^ically. There are all 
sorts of fancy theories to account 
for it; one of the more recent is 
that Kinsolving lies at the inter- 
section of stress lines, tliat there 
the very fabric of Space and 
Time is stretched almost to burst- 
ing, that the boiuidaries between 
Then and Now, between Here 
and There, are so tliin as to be 
almost nonexistent. Oh, I know 
that the same sort of thing has 
been said often enough about the 
Rim Worlds in general — but 
nowhere is the effect so pro- 
nounced as on Kinsolving. Peo- 
ple just didn’t like living on a 
world where they could never 



feel sure of anything, where tfiere 
was alwa 3 TS the dread at the bach 
of their minds that the Change 
Winds would readi gale force at 
any tick of the clock. So, when 
their suicide rate had risen to an 
unprecedented level and their nut 
hatches were crammed to capac- 
ity, they got the hell out 

“That was that. And then, a 
century and a half ago Galactic 
Standard, one of the Commis- 
sion’s tramps. Epsilon Eiidani, 
made an emergency landing at 
the Spaceport. She had to recali- 
brate the controls of her Mann- 
scheim Drive and, as you know, 
that’s best done on a planetary 
surface. It could be that the tem- 
poral precession fields set up 
while this was being done trigger- 
ed some sort of continuum-warp- 
ing chain reaction . Anyhow, 
a few of the officers were allowed 
shore leave, and they decided to 
explore the famous caves, which 
were not far distant. In these 
caves are remarkably well-pre- 
served rock paintings, made by 
the Stone Age aborigines who 
once lived on Kinsolving. What 
happened to them, nobody 
knows. They just vanished, mil- 
lennia before the first humans 
landed. The officers returned to 
their ship in quite a dither, re- 
porting that the paint of some 
of the pictures of various animals 
was wet. 

“The Federation’s Survey Ser-

THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



vice finally got to hear about 
this and sent a small team of in- 
vestigators, one of them a very 
well qualified young lady from 
the Rhine Institute. They found 
the rock paintings without any 
trouble — and found that a new 
one had been added, one depict- 
ing men in the standard space- 
man’s rig of that period. While 
they were standing around mar- 
velling, they were pounced up»on 
by a horde of cavemen and made 
prisoner. 

4 4T)ut the Rhine Institute’s star 
graduate was equal to the 
occasion. Telepathy, teleporta- 
tion, psycho-kinesis — you name 
it, she had it. The party escaped, 
with a prisoner of their own, the 
artist in person. His name was 
Raul . 

“And, back on Earth, Raul be- 
came a pet of the Rhine Institute 
himself. He was a very specializ- 
ed kind of painter. When he drew 
an animal, that animal was 
drawn, in the other sense of the 
word, to within range of the 
weapons of the hunters. He was 
also a telepath; after the Institute 
had just about sucked him dry, 
he went to Francisco to become 
Chief Psionic Radio Officer of 
the Deep Space Communications 
Station on that world. By this 
time he’d married the wench who 
had captured him and, although 
he wasn’t human, strictly speak- 
124 



ing, the genetic engineers were 
able to make certain modifica- 
tions to his body, so that the 
union was a fruitful one. 

“You’ve been to Francisco, of 
course. You know how religion 
is almost a primary industry on 
that planet. Raul got religion — 
and became, of all things, a Neo- 
Calvinist, as did all his family. 
His great-granddaughter fell from 
grace with a loud thud and be- 
came one of the so-called Blos- 
som People ...” 

“So there’s a woman mixed up 
in it!” commented Sonya. 

“Look around, my dear, and 
you’ll find a woman mixed up in 
almost everything. But where 
was I? Yes, Clarisse. She rather 
overdid things — drink, sex, 
drugs — and was picked out of 
the gutter and brought back into 
the fold. But the Neo-Calvinists 
weren’t being charitable. They 
knew that she had inherited her 
ancestor’s talents, and they knew 
that certain of the psychedelic 
drugs amplified these same tal- 
ents, and so ... ” 

“And so?” she echoed. 

( C 4 nd so some perverted genius 
cooked up a scheme that 
even now makes me shudder. The 
idea was that she should be taken 
to Kinsolving and there, on a 
suitable mountain top, invoke by 
her graphic art and magic the 
God of the Old Testament, in the 

GALAXY 







pious hope that He would pro- 
vide for the Neo-Calvinists a new 
edition of the Ten Command- 
ments. That bimch of unspeaka- 
ble wowsers had to get the per- 
mission of the Confederacy, of 
course, before they could land on 
Kinsolving — and so my lords 
and masters decided that Com- 
modore Grimes, Rim Worlds 
Naval Reserve, should go along 
as an observer ...” 

“You never tell me anything.” 
“I wrote to you about it. And 
it’s all in the reports that you, 
as the senior representative of 
the Survey Service’s Intelligence 
Branch on the Rim Worlds, 
should have read by now. Be- 
sides, I’ve hardly had a chance 
to get a word in edgewise since 
you came Home.” 

“Never mind that. What hap- 
pened?” 

“They set up shop on top of 
the mountain that they’d decided 
was the new Sinai. Clarisse, after 
the proper preparations, painted 
a picture of a suitably irate look- 
ing white-bearded deity . The 
trouble was, of course, that so 
many of those patriarchal Gods 
looked alike. And the Blossom 
People’s religion is a pantheistic 
one. Cutting a long and sad 
story short — what we got wasn’t 
Sinai, but Olympus ...” 
There was a long silence. And 
then, “If I didn’t know you, and 
if I didn’t know from personal 
126 



experience what odd things do 
happen out on the Rim, I’d say 
that you’d missed your vocation, 
that you should be a writer of 
fairy stories . But you assure 
me that all. this is in the reports?” 

“It is. And Clarisse is still on 
Lorn. She married Mayhew. I 
was thinking that we might have 
them round tomorrow evening. 
And they’ll be coming with us 
in the Quest, in any case.” 

“But what’s our expedition 
supposed to be in aid of?” she 
demanded. “You’re leading it, 
and I shall be your second in 
command, and two more unlikely 
people to be involved in any sort 
of religious research I can’t think 
of.” 

The Commodore smiled a lit- 
tle crookedly. “I’ll tell you what 
Kravinsky said to me. ‘It boils 
down to this. Grimes. Both the 
Confederacy and our big broth- 
ers of the Federation think that 
something should be done about 
Kinsolving. Nobody is quite sure 
what. So I’m sending you, with 
your usual crew of off-beats and 
misfits, and if you bumble around 
in your inimitable manner some- 
thing is bound to happen ...” 

Sonya grinned back at him. 
“The man could be right,” she 
said.

GALAXY 



modore John Grimes command- 
ing, lifted slowly from Port For- 
lorn. She was well manned; 
Grimes had selected his crew, 
both spacefaring personnel and 
civilian scientists and technicians, 
with care. The officers of all de- 
partments were, like the Commo- 
dore himself, naval reservists, 
specialists in navigation and gun- 
nery and engineering, in ship’s 
bio -chemistry. And there was the 
Major of Marines — also, as 
were each of his men, a special- 
ist. Grimes hoped that the space- 
borne soldiers’ services would not 
be needed, but it was good to 
have them along, just in case. 
There was Mayhew, one of the 
few Psionic Radio Officers still 
on active service, youthful in ap- 
pearance but old in years, and 
Clarisse, really beautiful since 
her marriage and her breakaway 
from tiie Neo-Calvinists and their 
severe rules regarding dress and 
decorum, her hair styling reveal- 
ing the pointed ears inherited 
from her non-human ancestor. 
There were the two fat, jolly men, 
from the DowSer’s Guild who 
were shunned by the majority of 
the scientists, even in this day 
and age. There were men and 
women whose specialty was the 
measurement of radiation, others 
whose field was chemistry, or- 
ganic and inorganic. There were 
archaeologists and palaeontolo- 
gists and . 



“One more specialist. Grimes,” 
Admiral Kravinsky had growled, 
“and that old tub of yours won’t 
be able to lift a millimeter . ” 

But a converted freighter, with 
all space properly utilized, has 
quite amazing capacity insofar as 
the carriage of passengers is con- 
cerned. 

So she lifted, her Inertial Drive 
running sweetly and uncomplain- 
ingly, with Grimes himself at 
the controls, all the old skill 
flowing back into his fingers, the 
ship an extension of his fit, stocky 
body, obedient to his will, as were 
his officers grouped around him 
in the control room, each in his 
own chair with his own bank of 
instruments flickering on and off 
before him. 

She lifted, accelerating smooth- 
ly, soaring up to the low cloud 
ceiling and through it, breaking 
out into the steely sunlight of 
high altitudes, driving up to the 
purple sky that soon deepened 
to black, into the darkness where 
glimmered the few, faint stars of 
the Rim, where, rising above the 
gleaming arc that was the sunlit 
limb of the planet, glowed the 
misty ellipsoid that was the Gal- 
actic Lens. 

Sonya, who had traveled vast 
distances as a passenger, said 
quietly, “It’s good to see this 
from a control room again.” 

“It’s always good ...” said 
Grimes. 



THE KtNSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS

F araway Quest was clear of the 
atmosphere now, still lifting, 
and below them the planet pre- 
sented the appearance of a huge, 
mottled ball, an enormous flawed 
pearl lustrous against the black 
immensities. She was clear of the 
Van Allens, and Grimes snapped 
an order. The Senior Communi- 
cations Officer spoke quietly into 
his intercom microphone. “Atten- 
tion alll Attention all! There will 
be a short count-down, from ten 
to zero. The Inertial Drive will 
be shut off, after which there will 
be a period of Free Fall, with 
brief lateral accelerations as tra- 
jectory is adjusted.” He turned 
to the Commodore. “Ready, sir?” 
Grimes studied the chart tank. 
“Now!” he said. 

“Ten ...” began the officer. 
“Nine ...” 

Grimes looked to Sonya, rais- 
ed his heavy eyebrows and shrug- 
ged. She shrugged back and made 
even this gesture graceful. She 
knew as he knew that all this 
formality was necessary, only be- 
cause there were so many civilians 
aboard. 

“ , . Zero!” 

The irregular throbbing beat 
of the Inertial Drive suddenly 
ceased and there was brief 
weightlessness and short silence. 
Then there was the hum of the 
maneuvering gyroscopes, rising to 
a whine, and centrifugal force 
gently pressed those in Con- 
128 



trol to the sides of their 
chairs. Slowly, slowly the tar- 
get star, the Kinsolving Sun, 
drifted across the black sky un- 
til the glittering spark was cen- 
tered in the cartwheel sight; it 
wavered, then held steady. The 
Inertial Drive came on again, its 
broken rumble a bass background 
to the thin, high keening of the 
ever-precessing rotors of the 
MannscHenn Drive. Ahead, save 
for the tiny, iridescent spiral that 
was the target sun, there was 
only emptiness. Lorn was to a 
starboard — a vast writhing 
planetary amoeba that was drop- 
ping back to the quarter and 
dwindling rapidly. Out to port 
was the Galactic Lens, distorted 
by the temporal precession field 
of the drive to the similitude of 
a Klein Flask blown by a drunk- 
en glass blower. 

Grimes rather wished, as he 
had often wished before, that 
somebody would come up with 
another way of describing it. He 
doubted if anybody ever would. 

Ill 

T his was a far more pleasant 
voyage than the one that he 
had made to Kinsolving in the 
unhappy Piety. To begin with, 
he had Sonya with him. Second- 
ly, he was in command, and the 
the ship was being non his way. 
Faraway Quest was no luxury 

GALAXY 



liner, but she was warm and com- 
fortable. Her internal atmosphere 
carried the scents of women’s 
perfume, of tobacco smoke, of 
good cooking — not that omni- 
present acridity of disinfectant. 
The snatches of music that drift- 
ed through her alle3rways from 
the playmasters in the public 
room were anything and every- 
thing from grand opera to the 
latest pop, never the morbid 
hymns and psalms in which the 
Neo-Calvinists had specialized. 
He spoke of this to Clarisse. She 
grinned and said, “You’re not 
with it. Dad. You’re just not 
with it. By our standards this 
wagon is bitter — endsville, just 
a spaceborne morgue.” 

He grinned back. “If the best 
that the Blossom People can do 
is to resurrect the hip talk of the 
middle Twentieth Century, I 
doubt if you’re with it either.” 

“Every religion,” she told him 
seriously, “uses archaic language 
in its scriptures and in its ritu- 
als.” Then she laughed. “I’m not 
complaining John. Believe me 
I’m not complaining. When I 
look back to the Piety, and Rec- 
tor Smith and Presbyter Cannan, 
and that she-dragon of a Deacon- 
ess, I realize how lucky I am. Of 
course, I could have been lucki- 
er ... ” 

“How so?” 

“That tall, beautiful redhead 
of yours was left behind.” 

THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGUI 



“To say nothing of that high- 
ly capable telepath you’re mar- 
ried to.” 

Her face softened. “I was jok- 
ing, John. Before I met Ken — 
before I met him physically, that 
is — something might have been 
possible between us. But I’m well 
content now, and I feel that I 
owe it all to you Ken was against 
our coming on this expedition, 
but I insisted. I’ll do anjdhing I 
can to aid your . researches.” 

“Even to a repeat perform- 
ance?” 

“Even to a repeat perform- 
ance.” 

“I hope it doesn’t come to 
that.” 

“Frankly, John, so do I.” 

'^he voyage was over. Faraway 
Quest, her Mannschenn Drive 
shut down, her Inertial Drive 
ticking over just sufficiently to 
induce a minimal gravitational 
field, was falling in orbit about 
the lonely world, the blue- and 
green-mottled sphere hanging 
there against the blackness. The 
old charts were out, along with 
the new ones, made by Grimes 
himself with the assistance of the 
officers of Rim Sword. “Here,” 
said the Commodore, stabbing a 
blunt forefinger down on to the 
paper, “is where the spaceport 
was. There’s only a crater there 
now — Whoever or Whatever de- 
stroyed Piety made a thorough 
kS 129 



job of it. And here’s the city — 
Enderston it was called — on the 
east bank of the Weary River . 

“ ‘Where even the weariest riv- 
er winds somewhere safe to 
sea . quoted Sonya. “They 
must have been a cheerful bunch, 
those first colonists.” 

“I’ve already told you that the 
very atmosphere of the planet 
engenders morbidity. And there, 
on the shore of Darkling Tam, is 
what was the Sports Stadium 
where Rim Sword landed. In the 
absence of any spaceport facili- 
ties, it’s as good a place as any.” 
He turned from the chart to the 
big screen upon which a magnifi- 
cation of the planet was present- 
ed. “You can see it all there — 
just to the east of the sunrise 
terminator. That river with all 
the S bends is the Weary, and 
that lake which looks like an oc- 
topus run over by a steamroller 
is Darkling Tarn. The city’s too 
overgrown for it to show up at 
this range.” 

“You’re the boss,” said Sonya. 

“Yes. So I suppose I’d better 
do something about something.” 
He returned to his Executive Of- 
ficer. “Make it Landing Stations, 
Commander Williams.” 

“Landing Stations it is, sir.” 

The officers went to their ac- 
celeration chairs and strapped 
themselves in. In seconds the in- 
tercom speakers were blatting, 
“Secure all for Landing Sta- 
130 



tionsl Secure all for Landing 
Stations! All idlers to their 
quarters!*' And then the maneu- 
vering gyroscopes hummed and 
whined as the ship was tilted 
relative to the planet until the 
surface was directly beneath her. 
The sounding rockets were dis- 
charged as she began her descent, 
each of them releasing a para- 
chute flare in the upper atmo- 
sphere, each of them emitting a 
long, long streamer of white 
smoke. 

F araway Quest dropped steadi- 
ly — not too fast and not 
too slow. Grimes, making allow- 
ance for drift as the first of the 
flares was swept west by a jet 
stream, applied lateral thrust. 
Down she dropped, and down, al- 
most falling free, but always un- 
der the full control of her Mas- 
ter. The picture of the surface 
on the target screen expanded. 
The city could be seen now, a 
huddle of ruins on the river bank, 
and beside the lake there was the 
oval of the Stadium, Eau de Nil 
in the midst of the indigo of the 
older growth. The last of the 
flares to have been fired was still 
burning down there, the column 
of smoke rising almost vertically. 
The brush among which it had 
fallen was slowly smoldering. 

Grimes shivered. The feeling 
of deja vu was chillingly uncan- 
ny. But he had seen this before. 

GALAXY 



He had been Here before — and, 
save for the different choice of 
landing site, circumstances had 
been almost exactly duplicated, 
even to that luckily unenthusias- 
tic bush fire. Again there was the 
sensation that supernal forces — 
malign or beneficient? — were 
mustering to resist the landing of 
the ship. 

But she was down at last. 

There was the gentlest of 
shocks, the faintest of creakings, 
the softest sighing of the shock 
absorbers as the great mass of 
the vessel settled on her tripedal 
landing gear. She was down. 
“Finished with engines!” said 
Grimes softly. Telegraph bells 
jangled, and the Inertial Drive 
generators muttered to themselves 
and then were still. She was down, 
and the soughing of the fans in- 
tensified the silence. 

Grimes turned in his swivel 
chair and looked toward the dis- 
tant mountain pe.ak, its black 
truncated cone sharp against the 
blue sky. “Sinai,” Presbyter Can- 
nan had named it. “Olympus,” 
Grimes had called it on his new 
charts. It was there that the Neo- 
Calvinists had attempted to in- 
voke Jehovah, and there that the 
old gods of the Greek pantheon 
had made their disastrous ap- 
pearance. 

Grimes truly Hoped that he 
would never have to set foot up- 
on that mountain top again. 

THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGUI 



TTe was not first off the ship; 

after all, this was n® newly 
discovered planet, this was not 
an historic landing of Men. The 
honor fell to the Major of Ma- 
rines, who marched smartly down 
the ramp at the head of his clat- 
tering column of space soldiers. 
He barked orders and the detach- 
ment broke up into its compo- 
nent parts, fanning out from the 
landing site, trampling through 
the bushes. From somewhere 
came a sharp rattle of machine- 
pistol fire. The Commodore was 
not concerned. He said, “There’ll 
be fresh pork or rabbit on the 
table in the Marine’s mess to- 
night. Or pigburger or rabbit- 
burger if the man who fired was 
too enthusiastic.” 

“Pigs? Rabbits?” inquired Son- 
ya. 

“Descendants of the livestock 
brought here by the original col- 
onists. They — the pigs, probab- 
ly — seem to have wiped out 
most of the indigenous fauna. 
And, come to that, the hens and 
the sheep and the cattle.” He lit 
his pipe. “They were, I suppose, 
the two species best fitted to sur- 
vive. The pigs with their intel- 
ligence, the rabbits with their 
ability to go imderground and to 
breed . like rabbits.” 

She said, “I could do with some 
fresh air after weeks of the tin- 
ned variety. What’s good enough 
for pigs and rabbits and Ma- 
^RS 131 



rines is good enough for me.” 
as well that the gallant 
r.Tajor didn’t hear you say that. 
Commander Williams!” 

“Sir!” replied the burly Execu- 
tive Officer. 

“Shore leave is in order, as 
long as a full working watch — 
and that includes the manning of 
weaponry — is left aboard the 
ship at all times. And every party 
of boffins is to be accompanied 
by at least one officer or one Ma- 
rine, armed. Nobody is to go 
down the ramp without checking 
out and without wearing his per- 
sonal transceiver.* Apart from 
that, we'll make this a day of 
general relaxation. After all, there 
are no physical dangers on this 
world. As for the other kind — 
I doubt if the Federation’s Grand 
Fleet could cope with them.” 
“Good'-oh, Skipper,” replied 
Williams. 

Grimes glared at him, then 
laughed. “I wondered how long 
it would be before the veneer 
of your last drill in the Reserve 
wore off. Anyhow, those are the 
orders — and just try to re- 
member now and again that this 
is an auxiliary cruiser of the 
Rim Worlds Navy, not your be- 
loved Rim Mamelute.” He closed 
on a formal note. “The ship is 
yours, sir, until my return.” 
“The ship is mine, sir, until 
your return.” 

Then Grimes and Sonya went 
132 



down to their quarters, replaced 
their light uniform sandals with 
knee-high boots, strapped on their 
wrist transceivers and buckled on 
the belts from which depended 
their bolstered hand weapons. 
The Commodore was sure that 
these would never be required 
but, as leader of tiie expedition, 
he could not break the orders 
that he had issued. It was, he al- 
ready knew, warm outsider the 
slate-gray shorts and shirts that 
he and his wife were wearing 
would be adequate. 

''T^hey made their way down to 
the after airlock, checked out 
with the officer on gangway duty 
and walked slowly down the 
ramp. The fresh air was good, 
and the last traces of smoke from 
the now-dead fire added a pleas- 
ant tang to it. The light of the 
sun, past its meridian and now 
dropping slowly to the west, was 
warm on the exposed portions of 
their bodies. I made much bet- 
ter time down than Rector Smith 
did in his Piety, thought Grimes 
smugly. It had been late after- 
noon w*hen that ship landed. And 
yet there was a chill in the air — 
psychological rather than physi- 
cal. There was a chill in the air, 
and with the scent of green grow- 
ing things there was a hint of 
corruption. 

Sonya shivered. “There’s some- 
thing . wrong,” she stated. 

GALAXY 



“That’s why we’re here,” 
Grimes told her. 

They were met by the Major. 
He was returning to the ship, 
seven of his men behind him. 
Four of them carried the bodies 
of two large boars, slung on 
branches; the others were load- 
ed down with rabbits. The young 
officer saluted cheerfully. “Ene- 
my beaten off, sir, with heavy 
casualties.” 

“So I see. Major. But this is 
more than a hunting party, you 
know.” 

“I know, sir. I’ve set alarms all 
around the field so that we 
shall be alerted if an3dhing large 
and dangerous approaches.” 

“Good.” 

Grimes and Sonya walked on, 
picking their way with care over 
the tangle of tough vines, making 
their slow way toward what 
had once been the Stadium’s 
grandstand, but was now ter- 
raced, artificial hillock over- 
grown with flowering creepers. 
They saw the two dowsers stum- 
bling about happily with their 
gleaming divining rods in their 
hands, trailed by a bored looking 
junior officer. They passed a par- 
ty of the more orthodox scientists 
setting up a piece of apparatus 
that looked like a miniature radio 
telescope. They met Mayhew and 
Clarisse. 

“Do you feel it?” demanded 
the Psionic Radio Officer. “Do 



you feel it, sir? None of these 
others seem to.” 

“Yes, I feel it. And so does 
Sonya.” 

“Like sometiiing that had been 
waiting for us for a long time. 
Like something getting ready to 
pounce. But it’s not sure that it 
has the strength any more ...” 
“Yes ... I thought myself that 
the ominous atmosphere wasn’t 
quite so pronounced as when I 
was here last. What do you think, 
Clarisse? You were here too.” 
“Fm not as scared as I was 
then, John. But there are rea- 
sons for that.” 

“It’s pronounced enough for 
me,” said Sonya. 

“It’s here still,” admitted 
Grimes. “But it could be fading. 
It could be that this planet has 
been at the very focus of . 
forces, and now the focus is shift- 
ing.” He laughed. “We shan’t be 
at all popular if, after our mas- 
ters have sent us here at enor- 
mous expense, nothing happens.” 
“Frankly,” said Clarisse, “I 
hope nothing does.” 

IV 

X Tothing did. 

Day followed day, and the 
parties of scientists spread out 
from around the landing site, on 
foot and in Faraway Quest’s pin- 
naces. The archaeologists grub- 
bed happily in kitchen middens

THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



that they discovered on the banks 
of the lake and the river, pene- 
trated the caves and photograph- 
ed the famous paintings in a wide 
range of illuminations. Nothing 
new was found in the middens, 
no evidence that would throw any 
light at all on the disappearance 
of the aboriginal race. The rock 
paintings were just rock paint- 
ings, the pigments dry and an- 
cient The dowsers dowsed and 
discovered deposits of metals that 
would be valuable if the planet 
were ever recolonized. They 
found oil and mapped the mean- 
derings of underground streams 
in desert areas. The other spe- 
cialists plotted and measured and 
calculated — and found nothing 
that could not have been found 
on any Earth-type planet 

“At least,” Grimes said, “we’ve 
proven that this world is suitable 
for resettlement” He, with Sonya 
and Clarisse and Mayhew, was 
sitting over after-dinner coffee in 
his comfortable day cabin. “All 
hands are really enjosdng a mar- 
velous outdoor holiday.” 

“Exc^t us,” said Sonya in a 
somber voice. 

There's a reason for that my 
dear. You're sensitive to my 
moods, as I am to yours. And I 
had such a scare thrown into me 
when I was here last that I could 
never feel at ease on this plan- 
et And Clarisse was more fright- 
ened than I was — with good 
134 



reason! — and all the time she 
was in telepathic touch with 
Mayhew.” 

“I still say that there’s ^me- 
thing wrong,” insisted Mayhew. 
“I still say that we should be ab- 
solutely sure before we put in a 
report recommending another at- 
tempt at colonization.” 

Grimes looked at Clarisse. 
“Would you be willing to re- 
peat that experiment?” he asked 
hesitantly. 

She replied without hesitation. 
“Yes. I was going to suggest it. 
I’ve talked it over with Ken. And 
I feel that if I try to call those 
old gods, rather than the deity of 
the Neo- Calvinists, the results 
might be better. It could be that 
it is in their interests that his 
world be peopled again — this 
time with potential worshippers.” 
“Like your Blossom People,” 
said Mayhew unmaliciously. 

“Yes. Like the Blossom • Peo- 
ple. After all, the slogan Make 
Love, Not War, would appeal to 
Aphrodite if not to Ares ...” 
Grimes laughed, but without 
real humor. "All right, Clarisse. 
We’ll arrange it for tomorrow 
night. And we’ll have all hands 
out of the ship and well scatter- 
ed just in case Zeus is too handy 
with his thunderbolts again. Wil- 
liams has been getting too fat and 
lazy; itTl do him good to have 
a job of organization thrown 
suddenly on to his lap ...” 

GALAXY 



■\^^ilhams enjoyed himself; 

' ’ things had been almost too 
quiet for his taste. And then, 
with the ship quiet and deserted, 
Grimes, with Sonya and Clarisse 
and Mayhew and a full dozen of 
assorted scientists, boarded one 
of the pinnaces in which the ne- 
cessary materials had already 
been stowed. 

It was just before sunset when 
they landed on the smooth, wind- 
swept plateau that was the sum- 
mit of the mountain. A thin, icy 
wind swept into the little cabin 
as the door opened. One by one. 
Grimes in the lead, the members 
of the party clambered down on- 
to the barren rock, the last ones 
to emerge handing down the 
equipment before making their 
own exits. There was an easel, 
as before, a floodlight, pots of 
paint and brushes. There were 
cameras, still and cinematograph- 
ic, one of which would transmit 
television pictures to receivers on 
the plain below the mountain. 
There were sound recorders. 

Silently, slowly, Mayhew and 
his wife walked to the center of 
the plateau, accompanied by 
Grimes and Sonya, carr3ung what 
she would be using. Grimes set 
up the easel, with its stretched 
black canvas, and the powerful 
floodlight. Sonya placed the 
painting materials at its foot. 
Mayhew, his thin face pale and 
anxious, lifted the heavy cloak 



from Clarisse’s shoulders. She 
stood there as she had stood be- 
fore, naked save for the brief, 
rough kilt of animal hide, her 
arms crossed over her full breasts 
for warmth rather from modesty. 
She looked, thought Grimes 
again, as her remote ancestresses 
on this very world must have 
looked and was about to practice 
the magic that they had prac- 
ticed. Mayhew had produced 
from a pocket a little bottle and 
a tiny glass — the psydiedelic 
drug. He filled the glass and held 
it out to her. “Drink this, my 
dear,” he ordered gently. 

She took it from him, drained 
it and threw it down. It shat- 
tered with a crystalline crash, 
surprisingly loud in spite of the 
wind. “Your bare feet ...” mut- 
tered Mayhew. He squatted 
down, carefully picking up the 
glittering fragments. She did not 
appear to see what he was do- 
ing, but stood like a statue when 
he got to his feet again and laid 
his free hand on her naked 
shoulder in an attempt to gesture 
reassurance and . farewell? 

He whispered to Grimes, his 
voice taut with strain and worry, 
“I can’t get through to Her, 
Somebody, something’s got hold 
of her ...” 

^^he three of them walked back 
to where the scientists were 
standing by the pinnace, their re- 

135

cording apparatus set up and 
ready. And suddenly the sun was 
gone, and there was only the 
glare of the floodlight in which 
Clarisse was standing. Overhead 
was the almost empty black sky 
with its sparse scatter of dim 
stars, and low to the east was 
the arc of misty luminescence 
that was the slowly rising Galac- 
tic Lens. The wind could have 
been blowing straight from inter- 
galactic Space. 

Conditions were almost the 
same as they had been on the 
previous occasion. Almost. It was 
the human element that was dif- 
ferent. This time those on the 
mountain top were sceptics and 
earnest inquirers, not true be- 
lievers. But the feeling of almost 
unendurable tension was the 
same. 

Hesitantly, Clarisse stooped to 
the dlutter of materials at her 
feet. She selected a brush. She 
dipped it into one of the pots, 
then straightened. With swift, 
sure strokes she began to paint. 

But it was wrong, Grimes re- 
alized. It was all wrong. It was 
white paint that she had used 
before; this time she was apply- 
ing a tuight, fluorescent pigment 
to the canvas. A figure was tak- 
ing shape — that of a tall, slen- 
der man in red tights, with a 
pointed beard, a mocking smile 
... A man? But men do not 
have neat little goatlike horns 
136 



growing from their heads, neither 
do they have long, lissome tails 
ending in a barbed point . 

A god? 

Pan, perhaps. 

No, not Pan. Pan never looked 
like that. 

There was a dreadful crack of 
lightning dose at hand — too 
close at hand; the flash was not 
blue-white but a dull, unnatur- 
al crimson. There was a choking, 
sulphurous stench. And then he 
was standing there, laughing 
amid the clouds of black smoke. 

Grimes heard one of the scien- 
tists almost scream, “What the 
devil . ?” 

And the devil advanced, still 
laughing, his very white and very 
sharp teeth flashing. His surpris- 
ingly elegant right hand stretch- 
ed out to rest on the Commo- 
dore’s wrist. “You are under ar- 
rest,” he said. “And I must warn 
you that anjdbing you say will be 
taken down and may be used as 
evidence.” 

“By what authority?” Grimes 
heard Sonya cry. “By what...?” 

And then there was darkness 
deeper than that between the vmi- 
verses, and absolute silence. 

V 

H ow long did the journey last? 

An eternity, or a fraction of 
a micro-second? It could have 
been either. 



GALAXY 




There was light again — not 
bright, but diiU and misty. 
There was light and there was 
solidity underfoot — and there 
was still pressure of that restraia- 
ihg hand on his wrist Grimes 
looked down — he was reluctant 
to look up — and saw what looked 
like a marble pavement. At last 
he allowed his eyes slowly to ele- 
vate. There were the slim, point- 
ed red shoes, inches from his own. 
There were the slender yet mus- 
culsu* legs in their skin-tight scar- 
let, gold-trimmed doublet . ' . 
Suddenly Grimes felt less fright- 
ened. This was the Mephistophe- 
les of fancy dress balls and of op- 
era. rather than a real and living 
embodiment of unutterable evil. 
But when he came to the face 
his assurance began to ebb. There 
was a reckless handsomeness, but 
there was power, too much pow- 
er — power that would be used 
recklessly and selfishly. 

Behind Grimes a very English 
voice was saying, “We must con- 
gratulate our friend on his speedy 
arrest, Watson.” 

A deeper voice replied, “Yes, 
yes, my dear Holmes. But are 
we sure that we have the right 
man? After all, to judge by his 
uniform, he’s an officer, and pre- 
sumably a gentleman ...” 
Mq>histopheles laughed sneer- 
in^T. “Hell I know the villain- 
ies of which so-called gentlemen 
are capable. But I have carried 
138 



out my part of the bargain and 
now I shall return to my own 
place; it’s too infernally cold here 
for comfort.” 

There was a flash of dull crim- 
son light, the stench of burning 
sulphur, and he was gone. 

“Turn around, fellow, and let 
us look at you,” ordered the first 
English voice. 

Slowly Grimes turned, and 
what he saw was no surprise to 
him. There was the tall man 
with aquiline features, wearing 
peculiar garments that he knew 
were a Norfolk jacket, an InvCT- 
ness cape and a deerstalker cap. 
There was the short, stout man 
with the walrus moustache, fca:- 
mally clad, even to black frodk 
coat and gleaming top hat. 

Grimes looked at them, and 
they looked at him. 

“Hand it over, sir,” ordered 
the tall man. “Hand it over, and 
I shall prefer no charges.” 

“Hand what over?” asked 
Grimes, bewildered. 

“My pipe, of course.” 

Oilently the Commodore drew 
^ the leather case from his 
pocket and placed it in the out- 
stretched hand. 

“A remarkable piece of deduc- 
tion, my dear Holmes,” huffed 
the stout man. “It baffles me how 
you did it.” 

“Elementary, my dear Watson. 
It should be obvious, even to 

GALAXY 



you, that a crime, any crime, can- 
not take place in the three di- 
mensions of Space only. The ad- 
ditional factor, the fourth di- 
mension of Time, must always be 
taken into account. I reasoned 
that the thief must be somebody 
living so far in our future that 
our fictional origin will be for- 
gotten. Then I enlisted the aid 
of the London branch of the 
Baker Street Irregulars — those 
fellows are always absurdly flat- 
tered when I condescend to share 
their dreams! Through them I 
maintained a round-the-clock 
watch on the antique shop that 
stands where our lodgings used 
to be. At last it was reported 
to me. that my pipe had been 
purchased by a red-haired young 
lady of striking appearance. I 
learned, too — once again 
dirough the invaluable Irregulars 
— that she was the wife of one 
Commodore Grimes, of the Rim 
Worlds Naval Reserve, and 
would shortly be returning to 
her husband, who was resident in 
a city called Port Forlorn, on a 
planet called Lorn, one of the 
Rim Worlds. These Rim Worlds 
are outside our ambit, but I was 
able to persuade that learned 
colleague of yours who dabbles 
ia magic to persuade his .. er 
. colleague, Mephistopheles to 
place his services at my disposal. 
Between us we were able to lay 
a very subtle phychological trap 



on yet another planet, one with 
the unlikely name of Kinsolv- 
ing ...” Holmes opened the 
case, took out the pipe, looked at 
it, sniffed it. His face darkened. 

“Sir, you have been smokini 
this?” 

“Yes,” admited Grimes. 

Watson intervened. “It will be 
a simple matter. Holmes, to steri- 
lize it. Just a jet of steam from a 
boiling kettle, back in our lodg- 
ings ...” 

“Very well. Watson. Let us 
proceed with the purification 
rites forthwith.” 

The two men walked rapidly 
away, their forms becoming in- 
distinct in the mist. Grimes heard 
Watson say, “And. when I chron- 
icle this case, I shall call it ‘The 
Adventure of the Missing Meer- 
schaum . 

And what about the Case oi 
the Kidnapped Commodore? 
wondered Grimes. But before he 
could start in pursuit of the 
great detective and his friend, an- 
other figure had appeared. 

He too was English, most re- 
spectably dressed in the style of 
the early Twentieth Century, in 
black jacket and trousers with a 
gray waistcoat, a stiff white col- 
lar and a black necktie. He was 
inclined to stoutness, but the la- 
dies of the servants’ hall must of- 
ten have referred to him — but 
never in his dignified hearing — 

“a fine figure of a man.”

T T e raised Kis bowler Kat — and 
Grimes Had sufficient pres- 
ence of mind to bring tbe edge 
of his right hand to the peak of 
his cap to return the salute. He 
said, his voice deferential but far 
from servile, “Welcome aboard, 
sir.” He contrived to enclose the 
words between quotation marks. 
“Er . Thank you.” 
“Perhaps, sir, you will accom- 
pany me. I am the only mem- 
ber of my profession in this place, 
and so it has become my duty 
— and my pleasure, sir — to wel- 
come new arrivals and to arrange 
for their accommodation.” 
“That’s very good of you, 
er . ” 

“Jeeves, sir. At your service. 
140 



This way. Commodore — I take 
it that the braid on your epau- 
lettes still has the same signifi- 
cance as in my time — if you 
please.” 

“Where are you taking me?” 

“I took the liberty, sir, of ar- 
ranging for your accommodation 
at the Senior Service Club. There 
are other naval gentlemen in res- 
idence. There is the Admiral — 
Lord Hornblower, that is. You 
must have heard of him. And 
there is Commander Bond — a 
very likeable young gentleman, 
but not quite my idea of what a 
naval officer should be. And . .” 
A flicker of distaste crossed 
Jeeves’ plump face. “ a cer- 
tain Lieutenant Queag, who 

GALAXY 



somehow appointed himself Club 
Secretary. He even tried to have 
Captain Ahab evicted from the 
premises. How did he put it?” 
Jeeves’ voice acquired a nasal 
twang. ‘“How can I run a taut 
ship with that damned whaling 
skipper stomping around the 
dedrs on his peg leg? He’ll be 
putting that pet whale of his in 
the swimming bath next. I kid 
you not’ But the Admiral — he’s 
President; although old Captain 
Noah is the senior member, he’s 
really not much interested in 
anything — asked my advice. So 
Commander Bond was ordered 
to act as a one-man press gang 
— a form of activity for which 
he seemed well qualified. After 
Cqptain Ahab had been pressed 
into the King’s service he was 
prcanptly commissioned by Lord 
Hornblower. As an officer of the 
Royal Navy he was really more 
entitled to Club membership — 
it’s a very British institution — 
than Commander Queag ...” 

“Very ingenious,” commented 
Grimes. 

“T am always happy to oblige, 
sir." Jeeves raised his hat to a 
tall woman who had appeared 
out of the mist, a striking bru- 
nette, bare footed, wearing a long 
white nightgown. “Good morn- 
ing, Your Ladyship.” 

She ignored him but concen- 
trated on Grimes. She glared at 
him from slightly mad dark eyes. 



and all the time her hands were 
making peculiar wringing mo- 
tions. “Ye havena brought any 
decent soap wi’ ye?” she demand- 
ed. 

“Soap, madam?” 

“Aye, soap, ye lackwitted Sas- 
senachl” 

“I’m afraid not. If I’d known 
that I was coming here ...” 



'^he woman brushed past him, 
muttering, “Will nothing 
wash these white hands?” 

“I have tried to help her, sir,” 
said Jeeves, “but I can do only 
so much. After all, I am not 
a qualified psycluatrist. But 
many of the guests in this estab- 
lishment are more odd than oth- 
erwise.” He gestured toward a 
break in the mist, through which 
Grimes glimpsed lush greenery, 
vivid flowers, a veritable jungle. 
And surely that was the coughing 
roar of a lion, followed by the 
shrill chattering of disturbed 
tropical birds . “Lord Grey- 
stoke lives there, sir, with his 
wife, the Lady Jane. They have a 
house in a big tree, and they 
consort with apes . And the 
people next door, in the next es- 
tate — like an English wood- 
land, it is — live in a gamekeep- 
er’s cottage. A Mr. Mellors and 
a Lady Constance Chatter ley. You 
would think that with their mu- 
tual love of nature the two 
couples would be on very friendly 



THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 141 



terms. But no. Lady Chatterley 
said to me once when I men- 
tioned it — it was when I had in- 
vited her and Mr. Mellors to my 
quarters for a real English after- 
noon tea, we were discussing the 
Greystpkes — ‘The only nature 
I’m interested in, Jeeves, is hu- 
man . Again he raised his 
hat. “Good morning. Colonel.” 

“Who was that?” asked Grimes, 
staring after the figure in the 
fringed buckskin shirt, with the 
revolver slung at each' hip. 

“Colonel William Cody, sir. 
I feel sorry for the gentleman. 
You see, he isn’t really one of us. 
As well as living an actual life 
on the printed page he was also 
a flesti and blood person. As I 
understand it, a New York pub- 
lishing house of his time com- 
missioned a writer to produce a 
series of stories about the Wild 
West, and this writer, instead of 
creating a character, used one 
who was already in existence in 
the flesh and blood world, call- 
ing him Buffalo Bill. And this, 
you will understand, makes him, 
insofar as we are concerned, ille- 
gitimate. But he is not the only 
one. There are the Greek ladies 
and gentlemen — ^Helen, and Cas- 
sandra, and Odysseus, and Achil- 
les, and Oedipus . And others. 
And, of course, there is the 
Prince, although His Highness 
claims that he was cribbed from 
an earlier work of fiction and not 
142 



from what the flesh and blood 
people call real life.” 

“So I’m not real?” demanded 
Grimes. 

“But you are, sir, otherwise 
you could never come here. You 
are, like the rest of us, a creation, 
a product of the imagination of 
some gifted writer.” He stopped 
suddenly, and Grimes stopped 
with him. “But, sir, are you an 
enduring product?” He walked 
around the Commodore like a 
tailor inspecting the fit and cut 
of a new uniform. “This is in- 
deed unfortunate, sir. Already I 
detect a hint of insubstantiali- 
ty ” He paused, turned to 
face a newcomer, bowed. “Good 
morning. Your Highness.” 

T he tall, thin, pale man in 
form-fitting black with the 
white lace at throat and cuffs 
did not reply to the salutation. 
Instead he said in a sonorous 
voice, “To be or not to be, that 
is the question ...” 

“Too right,” agreed Grimes. 
The prince of Denmark looked 
down at the age-mottled skull 
that he held in his right hand. 
“Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him 
well ...” He stared at the Com- 
modore. “But you I do not 
know.” He turned on his heel, 
strode away. 

“Goodnight, sweet Prince,” 
said Grimes bitterly. 

“Do not mind His Highness,” 
GALAXY 



said Jeeves. “He has a sardonic 
sense of humor.” 

“Maybe he has. But you must 
have had other . characters 
here who were not, as you put it, 
enduring products. What hap- 
pened to them?” 

“They . faded, sir. There 
was a young man dressed up in 
old woman’s clothing who called 
himself Charley’s Aunt. He lasted 
quite a few years, Earth Time, 
but he’s vanished now. And there 
have been many gentlemen like 
yourself, spacemen. None of them 
lasted long.” 

“But what happens to them? 
To usP' 

“I cannot say, sir. When the 
last book in which you appeared 
has crumbled into dust, when 
yoiir last reader has gone to 
wherever the flesh and blood 
people go, what then?” 

“There must be some way,” 
muttered Grimes. Then he shrug- 
ged. “All right. I’m scared. I ad- 
mit it. But my own case is dif- 
ferent. All you others came here, 
I suppose, after the death of 
your authors. You’re immortali- 
ty — perhaps — for the men who 
created you. But I was brought 
here before my time. I was the 
victim of a plot cooked up — and 
what more unlikely fellow con- 
spirators could there ever be! — 
by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. 
Faustus. And Mephistopheles.” 
Jeeves laughed quietly. “I 



knew that Mr. Holmes had lost 
his pipe. I offered to assist him 
in its recovery — but he, of 
course, was too proud to accept 
my humble services. He always 
likes to do things his own way. 
And you, sir, I take it, are the in- 
nocent victim. ” 

“You can say that again. I was 
shanghaied away from my own 
Universe to this . Limbo . .” 
“We prefer, sir, to call it the 
Hall of Fame.” 

“And I’m not the only victim. 
Back there I’ve a wife, and a 
ship ... I must get back to 
them.” 

“I appreciate your anxiety, sir, 
and I admit that there could be 
need for haste. Time is measured 
differently here than elsewhere, 
sir, and already you are becoming 
quite diaphanous ... ” 

Grimes held out his hand, look- 
ed at it. He could see the marble 
flooring through skin and flesh 
and blood and bone. 

“Hurry, sir,” urged Jeeves, 

VI 

'^hey hurried. Nonetheless, 
Grimes retained a confused 
memory ofir their nightmarish gal- 
lop. Men and women stopped to 
stare at them — and some of 
them Grimes recognized, and 
some were hauntingly familiar, 
and a very few struck no chords 
in his memory whatsoever. There 



THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



143 



were occasional rifts in the eddy- 
ing mists to afford fleeting glimp- 
ses of buildings; like the clothing 
of the people, tfife architecture 
was of all Historical periods. Tur- 
reted Camelot, its towers a-flut- 
ter witH gay permons, sped by; 
and beyond its walls was a bar- 
ren and dusty plain whereon a 
solitary knigKt, a scarecrow figure 
astride a skeletal Horse, tilted at 
windmills. Then tHere was Sher- 
wood Forest, where tHe outlaws 
in Lincoln green paused in their 
arcfiery practice to cheer on the 
two nmners. 

And for a while there was the 
shambling monstrosity .that lurch- 
ed along beside them, keeping 
pace, like a large, unlovely dog, 
trying to make friends. Grimes 
glanced at this giant, who seem- 
to have been put together from 
not quite matching parts pilfered 
from the graveyard, then looked 
hastily away, sickened by the 
sight of him and by the charnel 
stench that emanated from the 
crudely humanoid form. Then 
there was the other monster, the 
handsome man in Nineteenth 
Century dress finery who hovered 
above them on black bat’s wings. 
Jeeves, who did not suffer from 
lack of wind, muttered something 
uncomplimentary about Eastern 
European aristocracy. 

At last there loomed before 
them the house that was their 
destination. All high gables it 

144 



was, and oak beams, with narrow 
diamond-paned windows. Set 
high on the stout, iron-bound 
door was the black, iron knocker 
— - metal cast in the form of an 
inverted crucifix. Jeeves reached 
for it, rapped smartly. 

Slowly the door creaked open. 
An old gray-bearded man peered 
cut at them suspiciously. He was 
dressed in a rusty black robe up- 
on which cabalistic symbols 
gleamed with a dull luster, and he 
wore a tall, conical, black hat. 
His blue eyes were so faded as to 
be almost white. 

He demanded querulously, 
“Who disturbs my rest?” 

“It is I, Jeeves, Herr Dok- 
tor . ” 

“And this other? This . * 
phantasm?” 

“The innocent victim. Dr. 
Faustus, of the peculiar machina- 
tions set in motion by yourself 
and Mr. Holmes.” 

“What is done cannot be un- 
done.” He glared at Grimes — 
through Grimes. “And do you 
cry, ‘Oh, Lord, put back Thy 
Universe, and give me back my 
yesterday?’ ” 

“I have done so,” whispered 
Grimes. “As who has not?” 

“I cannot help you,” The door 
was starting to close. 

B ut Jeeves had inserted a stout, 
highly polished shoe into the 
narrowing opening. “Do not forget 

GALAXY 



that I have helped you. Dr. 
Faustus. Have I not sent pa- 
tients to you?” He added nastily, 
“Although Achilles still limps, 
and Oexlipus still chases after old- 
er women ...” 

“My name is Faustus, not 
Freud,” grumbled the old man. 

“Furthermore,” continued 
Jeeves, “both you and your part- 
ner upon me for the supply 
of luxuries that were unavailable 
in your own day and age.” 

The door opened abruptly. 
“Come in!’ snarled the doctor. 

Inside it was dark, the only 
light coming from a brazier over 
which a cauldron bubbled. The 
room was a large one, but it was 
so iiuttered with a fantastic mis- 
cellany of objects that it was 
hard to move without fouling 
scunething. Grimes ducked hasti- 
ly to avoid striking his head on 
a stuffed crocodile that hung from 
the low ceiling, then almost trip- 
ped over a beautiful — but woe- 
fully inaccurate — celestial globe 
that stood on the stone floor. He 
would have tripped had his body 
been solid — but his shadowy 
leg passed through the obstacle 
with no more than the faintest 
hint of resistance. 

Grumblingly, the old man shuf- 
fled to a bench littered with the 
apparatus of alchemy. “Chalk. 
...” he muttered, “for the penta- 
gram . Where did I put it? And 
the sulphur candles ...” 



“There’s no time for that. Doc- 
tor. Can’t you see? This gentle- 
man needs help urgently.” 

“But He will not like it if I do 
not observe protocol.” 

“He won’t like it if he had to 
go thirsty from now on.” 

“Very well, very well. But I 
warn you — He will be bad 
tempered.” 

Dr. Faustus tottered to a low 
table upon which stood a large, 
stuffed owl. He lifted the bird 
— which was hollow — revealing 
a jarringly anadironistic tele- 
phone. He handed the owl to 
Jeeves, who regarded it with some 
distaste; then he took the hand- 
set from its rest and punched a 
number. 

“Yes,” he croaked into the in- 
strument. “At once.” There was 
a pause. “Yes, I know that you 
always insist that the proper pro- 
cedure be followed, but Mr. 
Jeeves says that this is urgent.” 
There was another pause. “You’d 
better come, unless you want to 
do without your brandy and 
cigars ...” 

This time there was no thun- 
der, no crimson lightning, no 
clouds of black, sulphurous 
smoke. But Mephistopheles was 
standing there, his arms folded 
over his muscular chest, scowling 
down at Grimes. “Yes?” he de- 
manded shortly. “Yes, my man?” 
The Commodore, his voice a 
barely audible whisper, said, 

145 



THE KJNSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



“Take me back to where I be- 
long.” 

T T e was standing in a ship’s cab- 
in. The carpeted deck sway- 
ed and lurched under his feet. 
From somewhere below came the 
beat of machinery. It was not the 
irregular throb of Inertial Drive 
generators but the slow, steady 
thudding of some kind of inter- 
nal combustion engine. Grimes 
blinked. After the gloom of Dr. 
Faustus’ house, the light was daz- 
zling. Then, with his eyes back 
in focus, he saw bulkheads pan- 
eled in grained, polished wood. 
He saw an imtidy desk — and at 
it, his back to Grimes, sat a gray- 
haired man pounding an archaic 
typewriter. He was dressed in a 
black uniform, and on each of 
his shoulder-boards were four 
bands of gold braid, the middle 
two of each set interlaced to 
form a diamond. He was smoking 
a pipe, the foulness of which even 
Grimes considered completely de- 
plorable. 

The Commodore stepped si- 
lently forward, peered over the 
writer’s shoulder. He read. He 
was standing in a ship’s cabin. 
The carpeted deck swayed and 
lurched under his feet . Then 
Grimes put out a hand to the 
back of the other man’s chair to 
steady himself. 

The writer stared violently and 
exclaimed, “What the belli” He 
146 



twisted in his seat, staring at 
Grimes. His pipe fell from his 
mouth and clattered to the deck. 
“No ...” he said slowly. “No. 
It can’t be. Go away.” 

“I wish that I could,” Grimes 
told him. 

“Then why the Hell don’t you?” 

“You, sir, should know the an- 
swer to that question,” said 
Grimes, reasonably enough. He 
looked curiously at the other man, 
his . creator? His . parents? 
But there was no physical resem- 
blance to himself. Grimes was 
short and stocky, and his ears 
were his most prominent facial 
feature. The writer was tall, with 
normal enough ears, but too 
much nose. 

“You, sir, should know the an- 
swer to that question,” repeated 
Grimes. 

“I’m sorry. Commodore, but 
I don’t. Not yet, anyhow.” Then, 
in a tone of forced cheerfulness. 
“But this is only a silly dream. 
It must be.” 

“It’s not. Captain.” The man’s 
gold-braided epaulettes and the 
uniform cap with the scrambled 
egg on its peak, hanging on a 
hook just inside the curtained 
door, made this a safe enough 
guess. “It’s not. Captain. Pinch 
yourself.” 

“Damn it! That hurt.” 

Good. Do you mind if I sit 
down?” carefully, Grimes eased 
himself onto the settee that ran 

GALAXY 



along one bulkhead of the day 
cabin. He feared at first that lie 
was going to sink through the 
cushion; but it Had substance — 
or he had substance — and it 
supported Kim, although only 
just. He shut his eyes for a mo- 
ment, faying to dispd the faint- 
ness that was creeping over him. 
It was the result of shock, he 
realized, of shock and of disap- 
pointment. He had expected to 
find himself aboard his own ship, 
the old, familiar, tried and trust- 
ed Faraway Quest, to be wel- 
comed back by his wife. But 
where was he now? When was 
he? On Earth, the Mother World 
of humankind? Aboard some sort 
of surface vessel? 

^^he writer answered the un- 
spoken question. He said, 
“I’ll put you in the picture. 
Commodore. You’re aboard the 
good ^p Kantara, which plies 
between Melbourne and the port 
of Macquarie, on the wild West 
Coast of Tasmania. We load py- 
ritic ore in Macquarie for Mel- 
bourne and make the return 
trip — as we are doing now — in 
ballast. I doubt very much if 
you have anything like this trade 
in your day and age, sir. Mac- 
quarie’s one of those places that 
you can’t get into when you’re 
outside, and that you can’t get 
out of when you’re inside. To be- 
gin with, the tides are absolutely 



unpredictable, and it’s safe to 
work the entrance — it’s called 
Hell’s Gates, by the way — only 
at Slack Water. If you tried to 
come in against a seven-knot ebb 
you’d be in trouble! And the 
Iimer Bar and the Outer Bar are 
alwajrs silting up, and with strong 
North Westerlies — which we’ve 
been having — the Outer Bar 
breaks badly. I’ve been riding 
out a howling westerly gale, keep- 
ing well to seaward, as I just 
don’t like being caught on a lee 
shore in a small, imderpowered 
and imderballasted ship. But the 
wind’s backed to the south’ard 
and is moderating, and the glass 
is rising, and all the weather re- 
ports and forecasts look good. So 
I’m standing in from my last ob- 
served position — p.m. star sights 
— imtil I’m just inside the ex- 
treme range of Cape Sorell light, 
and then I’ll just stand off and 
on imtil daylight, keeping within 
easy reach of the port. Come the 
dawn. I’ll have a natter with the 
Harbormaster on the radio tele- 
phone, and as soon as he’s able 
to convince me that conditions 
are favorable I’ll rush in.” 
“Why bother with the extreme 
range of the light?” asked Grimes, 
becoming interested in spite of 
all his troubles. “You have ra- 
dar, don’t you?” 

“I do. I have radar and echo- 
sounder. But my radar gets old 
and tired after only a few hours’ 

147 



THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



operation, and my echo-sounder’s 
on the blink. I’ve nothing against 
electronic gadgetry as long as it 
can be relied upon. At the mo- 
ment, mine can’t be.” The writer 
lauded. “But this is crazy. To 
sit here discussing navigation 
witb a navigator from the distant 
FutMrei I hope that none of my 
officers come in to find me car- 
rying on a conversation with my- 
selfl” 

“I’m real. Captain. And I’m 
here. And I think that you should 
do something about getting me 
bade to where I belong.” 

“What can I do. Commodore? 
People have said, more than 
once, that my stories just hap- 
pen. And that’s true, you know. 
Furthermore, I’ve always given 
you a free hand. Time and timp 
again I’ve had to make plot 
changes because you’ve insisted 
on going your own way.” 

“So you can’t help me . ” 
wish that I could. Believe 
me, I wish that I could. Do you 
think that I want to be haunted 
by ytKi for the rest of my life?” 

“There coiild be a way ” 
whispered Grimes. Fes, he 
thought, there could be a way. 
Life in that Hall of Fame would 
not be at all bad as long as he 
— and Sonya — were assured of 
the same degree of permanence as 
the others — Oedipus Rex, 
Hamlet, Sherlock Holmes, James 
Bond , . He said, “I shan’t mind 
143 



a bit going back to that peculiar 
Elysium you cooked up as long 
as my status there is better than 
that of an ephemeral gate 
crasher. And, of course, I’d like 
Sonya with me.” 

“And just how can I arrange 
that for you. Commodore?” 
“Easily, Captain. All you Have 
to do is write a best-seller, a se- 
ries of best-sellers.” 

' I ^he other man grinned. “It’s 
a pity 3 mu can’t meet my 
wife.” He gestured towards a pe- 
culiarly two-dimensional photo- 
graph in a frame over the desk. 
The aubtmi-haired woman who 
looked out at them reminded 
Grimes oi Sonya. “That’s what 
she’s always telling me.” 

There was a sharp buzz from 
the telephone on the desk. The 
writer picked up the handset. 
“Master here.” 

“Third Officer here, sir,” Grimes 
heard faintly. “I’ve just picked 
uj^ Cape Sorell Light, at extreme 
range, right ahead ...” 

“Good. Mr. Tallent. Turn her 
on to the reciprocal course. Yes, 
keep her on Half Speed. I’ll be 
right up.” 

Grimes followed the shipmas- 
ter out of the day cabin, up the 
narrow companionway to the 
chartroom, out to the glass-en- 
closed wheelhouse, then out 
through a sliding door to the 
wing of the bridge. The night was 

GALAXY 



clear and the stars — would he 
ever see them again as more 
than lights in the sky? — were 
bright Astern was the winking, 
group-flashing light, an intermit- 
tent spark on the far horizon; and 
then the light itself was gone, 
only a flash recurring at regular 
intervals marking its position as 
the lantern dipped below the 
planet’s curvature. 

The captain grunted his satis- 
faction, then turned to stare for- 
ward. There was still quite a sea 
running, the wave crests faintly 
phosphorescent in the darkness; 
there was still a stiff breeze, 
broad on the port bow, but there 
was no weight to it. The ship was 
lifting easily to the swell, the 
motion not at all uncomfortable. 
The captain grunted again and 
went back into the chartroom. 
Grimes looked over his shoulder 
as he bent over the chart, noting 
the range circle with Cape Sorell 
as its center, the dot on it in the 
middle of its own tiny pencilled 
circle with the time — 2235 — 
alongside it, and another cryptic 
notation. On the chart, to one 
side, was a message pad. Final 
Gale Warning, it was headed. 
“Wind and sea moderating in all 
areas,” read Grimes. “All pres- 
sures rising.” 

The shipmaster was busy now 
with parallel rulers, pencil and 
dividers. From the observed po- 
sition he laid off a course — 



270° True. With the dividers fie 
stepped off a distance, marked it 
with a cross and wrote along- 
side it “0200?” Grimes realized 
that the officer of the watdh Had 
come into the chartroom. He 
could see the young man — but 
the young man, it seemed, could 
not see him. 

“Mr. Tallent,” said the ship- 
master, “we’ll stand out to this 
position, then bring her round 
to 090 True. All being well, we 
shall be within comfortable VHF, 
range at daylight, and with any 
luck at all the Bar will have 
stopped breaking and we shall 
have Slack Water. I’ll not write 
up my Night Orders yet; I’ll see 
the Second Officer at midnight 
before I tirni in ” 

“We should get in tomorrow 
all right, sir,” said the officer. 

“Don’t be so bloody sure. You 
can never teU with this bloody 
place!” 

Good night, sir.” 

“Good night, Mr. Tallent.” 

VII 

B ack in the day cabin, Grimes 
said, “You can see. Captain, 
that I have no real existence Here 
and Now. You must try to make 
me real somewhere.” 

“Or somewhen.” 

“Or somewhen.” 

“More easily said than done. 
Commodore. Especially in the ex- 

149 



THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



isting circumstances. At the mo- 
ment of writing — / am Master 
of this little rustbucket. Master 
under God', as Lloyd’s puts it. 
This ship is my responsibility — 
and you should be able to appre- 
ciate that. This evening I was 
writing just as relaxation — one 
hand on the keyboard, the other 
ready f» pick up the telephone.” 
Grimes said, “You take your- 
self too seriously. This is only a 
small sliip, with a small crew, on 
an unimportant trade.” 
“Nonetheless,” the shipmaster 
told him, “this is my ship. And 
the crew te my crew. The trade? 
That’s the Company’s worry — 
but, as Master, it’s up to me to 
see that the ship shows a profit.” 
“And I'm your responsibility 
too,” Grimes pointed out. 

“Are you? As I’ve already said, 
Commodore, you’ve proven your- 
self able to go your own sweet 
way in any story that I’ve writ- 
ten. But if I am responsible — 
just bear in mind that I could 
kill you off as easily as I 
could swat a fly. More easily. 
How do you want it? Act of God, 
the King's enemies, or pirates? 
Nuclear blast — or a knife be- 
tween the ribs?” 

“You’re joking, surely.” 

“Am I? Has it never occurred 
to you, Commodore, that a writer 
gets rather tired of his own pet 
characters?- Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle k^ed off Sherlock Holmes 
150 



— but had to drag him back to 
life to please his public. Ian 
Fleming was becoming more than 
somewhat browned off with 
James Bond when he, himself, 
kicked the bucket ...” 

Grimes looked toward the 
photograph over the desk. “But 
you like Sonya,” he said. 

“I do. She’s too good for you.” 
“Be that as it may. She’s part 
of niy world, my time ...” 
“So?” 

“Well, I thought ...” 

The telephone buzzed. The 
shipmaster picked up the hand- 
set. “Yes?” 

“The wind's freshening, sir, and 
it’s veered to West.” 

“Put her back on Full Speed, 
Mr. Tallent.” The captain got 
up from his chair, and went to 
the aneroid barometer mounted 
on the bulkhead. He tapped it. 
The needle jerked in an anti- 
clockwise direction. “Just what I 
need,” he said. “A bloody sec- 
ondary.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“It means. Commodore, that 
those Final Gale Warnings aren’t 
worth the paper that Sparks 
typed them on. Very often, too 
often, in these waters the secon- 
dary depression is more vicious 
than the so-called primary.” 
“What can you do?” 

“Stand out. Make offing. Get 
the hell off this bloody lee 
shore.” 



GALAXY 



Again the telephone buzzed. 
“Master Here.” 

“Sir, we’ve lifted Cape Sorell 
again ...” 

“Tell the engineers to give her 
all they’ve got. I’ll be right up.” 

T he ship was lurching and roll- 
ing heavily as she fell away 
from the wind. She was pound- 
ing as her fore part lifted and 
slammed back down into the 
trough. Her screw was racing 
each time 'that her stem came 
clear of the water — and as the 
propeller lost purchase, so did 
the rudder. “Sir,” complained 
the helmsman, “the wheel’s hard 
over, but she’s not coming back.” 
“Keep it hard over until she 
answers,” ordered the Master. He 
was looking into the radar screen. 
It was not a very good picture. 
There was spoking, and there 
was too much clutter. But there, 
ri gh t astern, was the faint out- 
line of the rocky coast, a ragged 
luminosity. And there were the 
range circles — and slowly the 
coastline was drifting from the 
24 mile to the 200 mile ring. Even 
Grimes, peering over the man’s 
shoulder, could appreciate what 
was happening. 

“Mr. Tallentl” 

“Sir?” 

“Call the Chief Officer. Tell him 
to flood the after hold.” 

"Flood the after hold, sir?” 
“You heard me. We have to get 



the stern down somehow, to give 
the screw and the rudder some 
sort of grip on the water.” 
“Very good, sir.” 

She’s logging three knots,” 
whispered the Master. “But she’s 
making one knot — astern. And 
that coast is nothing but rocks.” 
“And flooding the hold will 
help?” asked Grimes. 

“It’d better. It’s all I can do.” 
They went back out to the 
wing of the bridge, struggling to 
retain their balance as the wind 
hit them. Cape Sorell light was 
brightly visible again, right astern 
— and even to the naked eye it 
had lifted well clear of the sea 
horizon. A shadowy figure join- 
ed them there — the Chief Offi- 
cer, decided Grimes. 

“I’ve got two fire hoses run- 
ning into the hold, sir. What 
depth of water do you want?” 
“I want 100 tons. Go below 
and work it out roughly.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

Another officer came onto the 
bridge — big, burly, bearded. 
This must be, realized Grimes, 
the midnight change of watch. 
“Keep her as she’s going, sir?” 
“Yes. Keep her as she’s 
going. Mr. Mackenzie, She’ll 
be steering better once we get 
some weight in aft, and racing 
less. But you might tell the en- 
gineers to put on 'the second 
steering motor ...” 

“Will do, sir?” 



THE KINSOLVINGS' PLANET IRREGULARS 



151 



' I 'he shipmaster made his way 
back into the wheelhouse, 
staggering a little as the vessel 
lurched in the heavy swell. He 
went to the radar unit and looked 
down into the screen, with 
Grimes peering over his shoulder. 
Right astern, the ragged outline 
of Cape Sorell was touching the 
twenty-mile ring. Slowly the 
range decreased — slowly, but 
inexorably. 

The Chief Officer was back.

About two foot six should do it, 
sir.” 

“Make it that ...” 

Then gradually, the range was 
opening again, and the frequent 
heavy vibrations caused by the 
racing screw were becoming less. 
The wind was still shrieking in 
from the westward, whipping the 
crests off the seas, splattering 
them against the wheelhouse win- 
dows in shrapnel bursts of spray, 
but the ship was steering again, 
keeping her nose into it, clawing 
away from the rocks that had 
claimed, over the years, too many 
victims. 

Grimes followed the Master down 
to the afterdeck and stood with 
him as he looked down a trunk- 
way into the flooded hold. Swirl- 
ing in the filthy water were the 
timbers of the hold ceiling, crash- 
ing against the bulkheads fore 
and aft, splintering themselves 
against frames and brackets and 
the hold ladders, self-destroy- 
ing battering rams driven by the 
force of the ship’s pitching and 
rolling. There would be damage 
— even Grimes could see that — 
and, inevitably, the writing of 
reports with carbon copies ev- 
ery which way. 

Grimes knew this, and he 
should have had more sense than 
to attempt to bring up the sub- 
ject again of his own, private 
worries. 

He said, “This hold flooding 
GALAXY 




seems to have worked out ...” 
“Yes.” 

“Then perhaps. Captain, you 
could spare the time to discuss 
the question of returning me to 
my own place and period ...” 
“Take offl” snarled the ship- 
master. “I’ve more important 
things on my plate than your 
troubles. Take off!” 

The screaming wind took hold 
of Grimes, whirling him away 
into the darkness. But, before he 
was gone, he heard the Chief Of- 
ficer ask his Captain, “Who was 
that, sir? I thought I saw some- 
body standing there with you, a 
stranger in an odd-looking uni- 
form. ” 

“Just a figment of the imag- 
ination, Mr. Briggs. Just a fig- 
ment of the imagination.” 

G rimes was standing in his own 
day cabin, aboard Faraway 
Quest. He was staring at Sonya, 
and she, her face white under 
die auburn hair, was staring at 
him. 

“John! You’re back!” 

“Yes.” 

“I’ve been holding the ship 
here on Kinsolving, but our lords 
and masters have been putting 
the pressure on us to return . ” 
“It wouldn’t have mattered,” 



Grimes told her. 

“Why not?” 

“Because wherever you are, 
that’s where I belong.” 

H e was sitting in his day cabin, 
trying to relax over a stiff 
drink. He had brou^t Kis ship 
into port, scurrjnng in dtuing 
a lull between two depressions, 
pumping out after ballast to com- 
pensate for the weight of the wa- 
ter in the flooded hold, clearing 
the Bar without touching. He 
was overtired, and knew that 
sleep was out of the question. 
But there was nothing for him to 
do; his Chief Officer was capably 
overseeing the pumping out of 
the flooded compartment and 
would, as soon as possible, put 
the necessary repairs in hand. 

He thought, I might as well 
finish that bloody story. 

He inserted paper into his type- 
writer, refuelled and lit his pipe, 
and began to write. As the final 
words shaped themselves on the 
white sheet he looked up at the 
photograph of the red-haired 
woman over his desk. Because 
wherever you are, that’s where I 
belong . 

“And I hope you’re satisfied, 
you cantankerous old baggage,” 
he muttered. END

'\JoVi know, I can hardly re- 
member what I was like when 
I first began this column. Oh, 
there are certain logical recon- 
structions I can make — for ex- 
ample, I wasn’t as idealistic. But 
we’ve shaken down so weU to- 
gether, you and I, that it seems 
as if we’ve always been married. 
I wish you wouldn’t nag, and you

wish I’d take out the garbage. 
^ But most of the children are heal- 
^ thy, and some day, when they’ve 
’ gone off and left us alone, we can 
support ourselves by selling our 
collection of threatening letters 
about deadlines. 

I remember — wow, I remem- 
ber — when I was very young, 
and all there was between me and 
> the wolves was science fiction. At 
the time, what kept me going was 
the sure, certain knowledge that 
some day I’d grow up to be like 
the engineers in ASF stories. (Lit- 
tle did I know that some day 
I’d be getting fabulous, high-pay- 
ing work in glamorous professions 
because I’d memorized the phras- 
ing patterns in the fast science 
features bovmd in to those same 
issues.) But when I was very 
young, it seemed to me that Hal 
Clement must be beyond question 
as an sf writer, and when I was 
older, sure enough, he wrote Mis- 
sion oi Gravity and proved it. 

In the meantime, in between 
time, though, he wrote not only 
Needle, Iceworld and Cycle of 
■ Fire to tune up for it, he also 
wrote — and has since written — 
a number of short stories. Al- 
though all of them are either im- 
peccable scientific extrapolations 
or at least extrapolations beyond 
my poor power to pec, not all of 
them are perfectly written. Some 
[ of them show his decided bias to- 
ward science, and consequently 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



you may find you do not like all 
his science fiction. Nevertheless, 
Small Changes (Doubleday, $4.95) 
is another one of those volumes 
in the Budrys Bookshdf of Badcs 
which you ought to have around 
the house, and which you ought 
to read — not that it’s any chore, 
mind you, to read such stories as 
“The Mechanic,” or “Dust Rag” 
or “Sun Spot,” for all that there 
are ovct twenty years between 
them. “Fireproof” is a hell of a 
good story and, having carefully 
re-read it, I find “Uncommon 
Sense” as engaging now as I did 
in first publication, gulp, 24 years 
ago, when getting betrayed by my 
crew was an everyday occurrence. 

There is a charm to these sto- 
ries — ■ I mean a spell, in this 
case, not a fey quality — which 
defies critical analysis in the usu- 
al sense. A lot of sf does, at least 
at my hands, because I find that 
a story like “Halo,” or “The 
Foundling Stars,” has merit, al- 
though both can be taken apart 
along exactly the same seams as 
“Raindrop,” which strikes me as 
a pretty low spot in this volume. 
It — this quality of worth — has 
little to do with nostalgia, for 
“Troian Fall” seemed as mediocre 
in 1944 as it does now. 

Clement teaches science to boys 
at a preparatory schooL He must 
be a wonderful teacher, for he 
certainly knows science, and — 
this may be the secret — he knows 

155 



what will interest young boys. The 
point is that adolescent boys do 
not act like either the people in 
blemish ointment ads or like the 
ones in novels by John Home 
Burns. They lead rich interior 
lives, as Booth Tarkington point- 
ed out some time ago. 

The Clement stories that really 
work — like Mission, or like 
“Fireproof” or “Uncommon 
Sense” — are, hke all Clement 
stories, scientific problems. The 
hero is found in an environment 
not at all like Earth’s, yet obedi- 
ent to the universal physical laws, 
and often — here’s the magic. — 
tantalizingly like Earth’s in just 
enough respects to involve both 
hero and reader in the feeling 
that any moment now, a simple 
ordinary human act will save the 
day. Performing the simple act is, 
of course, disaster under the cir- 
cumstances, and then we go on 
to solve that, etc. 

I wonder — are we too old to 
remember what it was like, up in 
the tree fighting off the Stukas 
and Messerschmitts, hopelessly 
overwhelmed, gallant, not always 
deadly accurate, eventually invul- 
nerable but often not only wound- 
ed but apparently slain? The sub- 
marine conning tower imder the 
blankets and pillows? Eh? Do you 
remember what it was really like 
when we knew there were penal- 
ties for stupidity and inappropri- 
ate behavior, but did not yet 
156 



know that we might never be ed- 
ucated enough, nor find the right 
attitude in time? Do you remem- 
ber how the foe betrayed his de- 
spicable nature by always being 
a stickler for the rules, and only 
at the last possible minute did 
omniscient virtue come to save 
us from his wily entrapments? 

A little Clement wouldn’t hurt 
you. It might teacH you some- 
thing. Or remind you of some- 
thing. Funny how it lasts. 

Rite of Passage, by Alexei 
Panshin (Ace) is a book I damn- 
ed near missed. Do not duplicate 
my error. Surely there are copies 
still on sale. 

Look, this is too serious a thing 
to kid around with. Every so of- 
ten, a book comes out with a dull 
title, an unestablished byline and 
the usual freight of overblown 
blurbs. Most of these books are 
not worth bothering with; there 
is no more reason to read every- 
thing than there is to review it, 
and most experienced readers long 
ago learned to judge enough of a 
book by its cover and a few inte- 
rior glimpses. But, every so often, 
a book will flunk all those tests, 
and yet be superb. What there is 
to do about it but apologize, enter 
the results of the lesson in one’s 
filtering mechanism and go on 
from there, I don’t know. One 
could preserve impenetrable si- 
lence, I suppose — I’m sure I’ll be 

GALAXY 



■ made to wish I had. But, in the 
! same breath in which I say that 
I have, too. read, all those books 
whose authors ought to be grate- 
ful for my silence, I apologize, 
Alexei. 

Auiyway. Rite of Passage, as I 
hope many of you already know, 
is a first-person story about a 
young girl growing up aboard an 
interstellar “spaceship” which, 
unlike the classic ships of such 
stories as “Universe,” is both ca- 
pable of faster-than-light travel 
and populated by people who 
know perfectly well that they are 
not Ihe only people in creation. 

' In fact, it’s a planetoid, hollowed 
out and motorized when Earth 
destroyed itself and rendered the 
Solar System unlivable, and it is 
now a recognized socioeconomic 
unit in a universe consisting of 
aU the planets on which colonists 
were hastily dumped and left to 
shift for themselves. Like other 
ships of its kind, it houses a tech- 
nically adept populace of mercan- 
tile entrepreneurs, who live on the 
margin between what the planet- 
bound colonists can use and what 
they can achieve by themselves. 
Most planetary civilizations hav- 
ing regressed to barbarity, the oc- 
casiCKial visitors from space are 
rich, respected and despised. 

All of this forms the not 100%- 
convincing background for the in- 
tensely believable, movingly per- 
sonalized story of Mia Havero, 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



ship’s child, daughter of a preoc- 
cupied but magnetic father and 
a neurotic, distant mother, late- 
maturer, genius, scapegrace, girl. 
Like all other ship’s children, she 
is destined to be dropped on the 
surface of some unspecified world 
for a month, there to fend for 
herself. This, she is told, is the 
traditional rite of passage; if she 
survives, she will be picked up by 
the ship again, and accepted as 
an adult. 

All right — much of that ra- 
tionale is, again, not too imper- 
meable, Panshin handles it ac- 
ceptably — better than most 
writers who have set up arbitrary 
new societies founded on manipu- 
lations of something in Margaret 
Mead — still, the book is in trou- 
ble as soon as Mia sets foot on 
her trial planet, and never quite 
recovers. But Mia’s actual matur- 
ation — and each of the little, 
perfectly realized, utterly real 
episodic steps on the way — is 
so perfectly done that one feels 
a real shock as one realizes 
that Panshin after all has never 
been a girl growing up aboard a 
hoUowed-out planetoid. 

Again, with something like this 
the next question is why did he 
have her^row up aboard a plane- 
toid at all, instead of on a farm 
in Kansas? That would be a fash- 
ionable question, and in some cir- 
cles it would be considered a flat- 
tering one. But I think Panshin 

157 



knows better, and I hope he does. 
He has done more here to tell us 
about all such girls, and all peo- 
ple and even about me and you, 
than could have been done other- 
wise. 

He has also told us something 
about himself. That is incidental, 
of course, but it certainly is some- 
thing. Welcome aboard, Alexei. 

H. P. Lovecraft, a Portrait, 
by W. Paul Cook, is available for 
$2.50 from Mirage Press. A re- 
publication in chapbook form of 
Cook’s introduction to Arkham 
House’s O.P. Beyond the Wall 
of Sleep, it touches on such per- 
sonal glimpses as Lovecraft’s taste 
for ice cream and fast driving, 
his introduction to amateur jour- 
nalism via the crudest recruiting 
methods available to boosterism 
and the deep devotion he inspired 
in his friends. 

Judging by this report alone, 

I wish very much that I had 
known the man. Certainly, if left 
only to the impressions created 
by his work, I’d probably never- 
theless picture someone no less 
removed from the nameless hor- 
rors he wrote about, but any hor- 
ror writer who tries to sample 
thirty-three flavors before break- 
fast K assuredly a man after my 
own heart. 

Certainly, this is a column 
about children. Take, for further 
158 



instance. Dr. Palfrey, hero of a 
sudden spate of paperback imita- 
tion Doc Savage novels, a crea- 
tion of the same John Creasey, 
who writes those good Gideon sto- 
ries, those O.K. Inspector West 
stories, those rather pastichey 
Toff and Baron stories, and now 
these positively dreadful yarns, 
taking place in some sort of 1928- 
future, about the forelock-tug- 
ging, bumble-footed Palfrey, who 
resembles nothing so much as a 
let’s-play-dress-up notion that 
horn-rimmed glasses make wis- 
dom. I tried The Terror entire, 
to get the full effect, and skim- 
med a couple of others. “Science 
fiction, espionage, hidden men- 
ace and straight detection in a 
tight package that will please 
fans of each,” says Library Jour~ 
nal on the back cover. Oh‘, wow. 
Library Journal! Why don’t you 
and Virginia Kirkus run off and 
find some other attic for this 
rainy day? 

Well, as I was saying back there, 
John Home Burns. I have a num- 
ber of people who look over my 
shoulder and tell me about my 
mistakes and their virtues, which 
is all right, because, opinion to 
the contrary, time has taught me 
that even I have to admit to scru- 
tiny. But the folk who want me 
to review something different, or 
to review differently, or not to 
review at all, are as nothing to 

GALAXY 



I the people whose toes I tread on 
in all innocence. So far in this 
column, for instance, I have men- 
‘ itioned Georges Bizet, some fellow 
named Offenbach, another feUow 
hamed Prosper Merrimee, who 
was a writer approximately as tal- 
ented as John Creasey, and now 
John Home Bums. I know, sure 
as it will rain in Indianapolis in 
the summer time, that someone 
who has read every word most as- 
suredly including the book about 
Naples and that book about the 
preparatory school, going on to 
the book about the fellow with 
the white-painted piano and the 
telejshone installer with the an- 
chovy paste, will write to me in 
an absolute fury, assuming that 
I have barely heard of his idol, 
and am slighting him to boot. I 
may even hear from Gore Vidal, 
who once solemnly promised to 
write the definitive biography of 
John Home Burns (deceased) 
and then commit suicide. 

But I bring all this up because 
not only did I spend part of my 
very first story check on a re- 
cording of the Tales of Hoffman, 
so long ago that Robert Rounse- 
viUe could still hold a note (yes 
I know about Man of La Man- 
cha!), but because I’m about to 
again review a book of my own, 
and furthermore a reprint, and 
how do you like them apples? 

I’ll be damned if 1’U embarrass 
one of my friends by casting him 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



in the role of “guest reviewer.” 
And I’U be equally damned if 
I’ll let this book go by unnoticed, 
because I didn’t write it to let 
anjdhing like that occur. Further- 
more, it’s a good book, although 
if you would like to read a close- 
ly reasoned analysis of its defects, 
try the second edition of Damon 
Knight’s In Search of Wonder. 
He’s wrong, but his reasoning is 
close. 

The book is called Who?, and 
it’s been out of print in the U.S.A. 
for ten years, having stayed off 
the market to satisfy various con- 
tractual maneuvers and the like, 
while pursuing a decent career in 
other lands and tongues. I bring 
it up to you — in fact, with some 
diffidence, but with some pride — 
as an opportunity to let you in to 
some extent on the inner work- 
ings of a writer’s mind, and with 
no pretense at objectivity. 

This is a story about a young 
boy who grows up to have brains 
but no face, training but no job. 
The narrative concerns itself with 
a fellow who has a secret — he’s 
a scientist, and knows how to 
build a K-88, whatever that is — 
and is contended over by people 
who buy secrets (the Allieds and 
the Soviets). When he’s caught 
in an explosion, he’s patched up 
by the Soviets and retrieved by 
the Allieds. But because his cre- 
dentials have been blown off, he 
can’t work, and not being able to 

159 



work is what destroys him, al- 
though his power pile is still a 
year or two short of accumulating 
a fatal dosage in his bones. 

Like The lion Thom, which’ I 
discussed too flippantly here, nev- 
er dreaming there were people 
who would go into fuming furies 
about it, this book represents a 
great deal of wHat I knew about 
life at the time I wrote it, worked 
into a tale so that what I could 
• systematize about life would be 
systematically evidenced. I don’t 
think this man’s story is tragic. I 
just think it occurs. And although 
it’s possible to poke holes in the 
technology, I think there would 
have been little trouble in chink- 
ing them up, if I Had not already 
spent a year in writing that story 
— and very little else — at the 
usual rates. 

It is, in other words, an honest- 
ly motivated book, told with all 
the talent I Had available in 1954, 
which is when I wrote it, still ac- 
ceptable prose today, conditioned 
by the fact that I was, as I am, 
a commercial writer. 

I wrote it, originally, as a short 
story, around a Frank Kelly 
Freas cover that I glimpsed one 
day in the offices of a magazine 
that never used its cover to illus- 
trate stories, but did, this one 
time, because the publisher could 
plainly see the maniac gleam in 
my eye. I would probably never 
have turned it into a novel, but I 
160 



needed to do something for my 
wife’s birthday, one year when 
we hadn’t been married very long, 
and as it happened there was a fel- 
low who would give me an advance 
on it if I came up with a chapter 
of something and an outline. And 
I finished it, eventually, on a 
typewriter set up next to my first 
child’s crib. In the year in wHicH 
I wrote it, and some short stories 
that still get anthologized for 
more than they originally earned, 
I earned less than two thousand 
dollars, all year. It got nominated 
for a Hugo, and A Case of Con- 
science beat it out, fair and 
square. Who? is almost as good 
as the Blish. 

Wrings your heart, doesn’t it? 
I didn’t tell you about it for that 
reason, or because I want to 
blackjack you into buying the 
new edition, which is from Lancer 
Books, with an adaptation of 
that original Kelly Freas cover. 
But if you read the book, or have 
read it, I’d like you to remember 
and please believe that what I’ve 
told you about is not typical 
only of my attitude, but of the 
attitudes of many of the people 
who have done things that get 
good notices and contribute to 
respectable reputations in this 
field, and I want you to luider- 
stand that it is entirely possible 
to be sidling up to people for 
loans while being accepted as a 
matter of course among the re- 

GALAXY 



spectable craftsmen of this field. 
This ■ — all of this, including this 
column, and the mail I get about 
it, and the odd feeling of dis- 
cussing Hal Clement as if I were 
entitled to — is what writing is 
like, what being a writer is like.

and what contributes to the feel- 
ing you get from reading. I sin- 
cerely hope neither of us ever 
grow up, but I will admit there 
are days when I wish we could 
sit down and rest a spell.

FORECAST 



As you wifi have seen by the date on this issue, we've skipped a 
month. The problem was printing. For reasons beyond our control the 
last few issues have been seriously delayed in the manufacturing stage; 
we think we've got it licked now; we think future issues will be not only 
on time liut handsomer and higher in quality . and we thank you for 
your patience over the last few months! 



Next month you should begin to see the improvements in packaging; 
and next month we celebrate with a couple of specially interesting 
items In the contents. 

For one, there's a lead story by Poul Anderson called The White King's 
War. As you can guess from the title, the story is about a sort of science- 
fiction chess game, an old and honored sub-category in the field (remem- 
ber Fritz Leiber's The Sixty-four Square Madhouse, for one?) But it's a 
little more than that. It's also a bang-up science-fiction adventure story, 
of the kind that Anderson does as well as anyone in the field; and all in 
ail, we think you're going to like it. 

And more, of course! Join us and see .

GALAXY’S STARS

When he isn’t writing stories 
like Dune Messiah, which begins 
in this issue, Frank Herbert is a 
newsman on a San Francisco pa- 
per and a leading light in the con- 
stellation of science-fiction celeb- 
rities who make their home in 
and around San Francisco. In 
company with Poul Anderson 
and Jack Vance, Herbert was co- 
captain and co-proprietor of a 
vessel which has become legend 
in science-fiction circles, a house- 
boat of distinctly temperamental 
personality. What it liked to do 
was sink. When the work of re- 
floating and refitting it got too 
onerous, the three owners one by 
one disposed of their interests, 
and it is said it is still to be seen 
in and around Sah Francisco 
• • but under non-science 
fiction ownership. 

Herbert’s career, of course, 
sails on handsomely. His first 
major novel. Under Pressure, was 
not only a smash hit with the 
readers but contakied at least 
one technological invention which 
has since been built and patented, 
the “submarine tug”. Dune a little 
later won all of science fiction’s 
awards. And now Dune Messiah 
is here to carry on the tradition. 



James Blish, a frequent and 
honored visitor in these pages, 
has been a part-time writer and 
full-time public-relations man, 
specializing in the largest of ac- 
counts, until recently. Now he 
has gone straight. He, wife and 
cats have left the Madison Ave- 
nue milieu and are en route to 
.England, where they propose to 
live between Oxford and London, 
and where Blish, with a little 
luck on our part, will be writing 
all the time and producing even 
more stories like The City Thai 
Was the World, 

James Sallis is one of the bright 
lights of science fiction’s “New 
Wave”. His principal activity has 
been in England, where he was 
associated with the magazine 
New Worlds; he now makes His 
home in Milford, Pennsylvania. 

A. Bertram Chandler is not 
only master of science-fiction 
writing, but master of a ship sail- 
ing between various parts in the 
Australia-New Zealand part of 
the world. If his hero. Grimes, 
sounds like a real ship’s captain, 
that’s because that is what 
Grimes’ creator is in real life.
