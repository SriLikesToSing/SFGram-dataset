Editorial 



IMAGINATION AND EVOLUTION 



“1 remember well how the thought struck me of making calculations for 
rockets. 1 think the first seeds were sown by the imaginative tales of Jules 
Verne, which assailed my mind. 1 was assailed by a sense of longing, and 
this set me to thinking in a specific way.” 

— Konstantin Tsiolkovsky 



Iou’ve heard it all before. 
Even if you’ve never read that par- 
ticular quotation, you know that 
science fiction has influenced the 
course of human events. Most of 
you were watching when men fi- 
nally landed on the Moon, and tele- 
vision interviewers sought out 
Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. 
Clarke for reactions to the realiza- 
tion of their dreams. 

You don’t have to take a college 
course to know that sf has had its 
impact on modern man in subtler 
ways as well. Words — and 
concepts — -like “robot” originated 
in science fiction. “Brave New 
World” has become a catchphrase 
with connotations known around the 
world. And 1984 has become a date 
to be feared. 

Science fiction has contributed 
not merely to events — the space 
program being the most obvious — 
but to attitudes. And its influence 
on attitudes — the way people think 
and feel about the future — is ulti- 
mately more important than its rela- 
tion to concrete events. 

For years, science fiction writers 
have denied they are in the business 



of “predicting” the future. And in- 
deed, even the greatest of them — 
like H. G. Wells — have sometimes 
proven poor prophets (Yes, he did 
predict the atomic bomb in 1914, 
but that inspiration was exceptional 
even for him). 

For almost as many years, many 
of the same writers haven’t always 
agreed on what business they are 
in. 

Some have claimed to simply be 
writing entertainment (which 
doesn’t explain why they don’t stick 
to westerns or detective stories). 
Others have claimed to be writing 
Literature (which doesn’t explain 
why they don’t stick to contempor- 
ary fiction). Still others speak seri- 
ously of exploring alternative 
futures — and they speak the truth, 
but not the entire truth. 

Science fiction, as you all know, 
is being taken a great deal more 
seriously these days. It is a 
phenomenon at once exciting and 
depressing. On the one hand, scho- 
lars and critics have come to realize 
that sf is not garbage: That it can be 
serious literature with serious 
themes. On the other, some of the 



4 



GALAXY 




same scholars and critics have little 
insight into the literature they take 
so seriously, pigeonholing it into 
categories they are familiar with, 
emtombing the real intellectual ex- 
citement of science fiction in 
academic prose as deadly as that of 
dissertations in any other field. 

“Mythology” became a catch- 
word in much sf criticism beginning 
in the 1960’s. Usually, it referred to 
the use (deliberately or otherwise) 
of figures, symbols and archetypes 
from classical mythologies. And, of 
course, many sf writers have played 
with such elements: Roger Zelazny 
transported the Hintu pantheon to 
another planet in Lord of Light (but 
note that said pantheon had an ac- 
tual function, related to the 
sociological and ethical themes of 
the novel). 

Less emphasis has usually been 
given to science fiction’s role in 
creating new mythologies. Donald 
A. Wollheim, now editor of DAW 
Books, devoted considerable atten- 
tion to it in The Universe 
Makers— not a scholarly book, and 
filled with idiosyncracies, but still 
interesting. 

Science fiction isn’t the first liter- 
ature to create a mythology. C.S. 
Lewis’ The Allegory of Love 
explored the origin and development 
of the mythology of romantic love 
in literature. James Fenimore 
Cooper has attracted renewed inter- 
est in recent times because, what- 
ever his crudities as a novelist, he 
created the mythology of the 
American frontier. 

But science fiction’s potential in 
this area is far greater than that of 
any previous literature. All 
mythologies are poetic expressions 



of what their creators have believed 
to be the essential relationships of 
men with each other, and with na- 
ture as a whole. Whether classical 
Greek, or Hindu, or Christian, they 
have tried to answer the questions: 
who are we? Why are we? 

In science fiction, we ask our- 
selves who we are and where we 
are and why we are in relation to a 
universe seemingly without limits. 
The last few centuries have been 
full of discoveries, but those with 
the most profound impact on the 
human imagination have been the 
Discovery of Time and the Discov- 
ery of Space. 

Many of the greatest works of 
science fiction have been part of the 
imaginative response to these dis- 
coveries. H.G. Wells’ The Time 
Machine isn’t so much a story about 
a time machine as one about Time. 
The classic space operas of E.E. 
“Doc” Smith and the early John 
W. Campbell weren’t only about 
spaceships and space battles, but 
about the vastness of Space itself. 

Olaf Stapledon, in the immense 
mythologies of Last and First Men 
and Star Maker sought to define the 
significance of man, and of any in- 
telligence, in the new Cosmos re- 
vealed by science. And he was not 
the last, nor even the first, to use 
science fiction to such ends. 

One could read the early science 
fiction of Wells, for example, as the 
struggle to create a new mythology 
from science to replace the old one 
of religion. The Island of Dr. 
Moreau is as much an allegory 
about the failure of revealed religion 
as about the beast in man, while 
The Food of the Gods tries to find 
the purpose of mankind as participa- 



5 




tion in evolution (an idea since 
taken up not only by other sf writ- 
ers, but by philosophers like Julian 
Huxley and Teilhard deChardin). 

And much of the literary history 
of science fiction is one of contend- 
ing world-views and mythologies. 
Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World 
and the Orwell’s 1984 were implicit 
attacks on the philosophy of Wells 
as well as explicit attacks on the 
evils of utilitarian materialism and 
totalitarianism. Clarke embraced the 
ideas of Wells and Stapledon in The 
City and the Stars and Childhood’s 
End; Lewis attacked both in his 
Ransom trilogy (especially That 
Hideous Strength). 

One can contrast the harsh 
mythology of Algis Budrys’ Rogue 
Moon, in which man is pitted 
against a universe entirely 
mechanistic and uncaring, with that 
of Clifford D. Simak in Way Sta- 
tion, in which there is a Purpose 
behind the universe, albeit not 
necessarily a personal God in the 
old Judeo-Christian sense. One can 
read attempts at a new synthesis 
into the works of Cordwainer Smith 
and Ursula K. LeGuin, which strive 
to reconcile the human values of 
Christianity and Taoism with those 
of science and evolution. 

Science fiction has transformed 
older mythologies as well. The 
myth of utopia goes back to ancient 
times — and was strong enough to 
give birth to modern Communism. 
When that turned sour, sf created 
the anti-utopian mythology of such 
classics as Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We. 
Yet it has also created vivid utopian 
alternatives as LeGuin’s The 
Dispossessed — not to mention such 
convergent ideas as her Ekumen and 



Poul Anderson’s Commonalty. 

Science fiction has been called a 
literature of ideas for so long that 
the phrase has become hackneyed. 
What we usually mean by the 
phrase is the concrete idea content 
of sf: the imaginative play with 
faster-than-light drives, neutron 
stars and black holes, alien worlds 
and psychologies (of which C.J. 
Cherryh offers brilliant examples in 
The Faded Sun: Kesrith, beginning 
this month). 

But science fiction is also a litera- 
ture of general ideas, even of 
philosophical ideas — perhaps the 
only form of such literature still in 
existence. When one thinks of the 
philosophical novel, one tends to 
think of weighty volumes about 
sensitive intellectuals holding dis- 
cussions on a mountain top, or 
Hermann Hesse heroes in quest of 
spiritual identity. These are expres- 
sions of the universal in humanity. 
And yet we now realize that hu- 
manity itself is part of a vast and 
mysterious universe — and almost 
certainly not alone in that universe. 
Surely any serious philosophical lit- 
erature must consider the place of 
mankind in that larger universe. 

Taking science fiction this seri- 
ously has its hazards, of course. 
Sturgeon’s Law applies as severely 
to “philosophical” sf as to any 
other kind — perhaps more so: there 
is nothing duller than a failed 
philosophy or a stillborn mythology 
in sf. Like any other elements in 
science fiction, its mythologies 
and philosophies must come 
naturally — as part of our genre’s na- 
tural interest in the future of man in 
the universe.

Personal death is 
hard enough to face. 

What then, when 
one fears his entire 
kind is dying? 

i 

Wind-child, sun-child, what is 
Kath? 

Child-bearers, laugh-bringers. 
that is Kath. 

It was a game, shon’ai, the 
passing-game, Kel-style, in the dim 
round hall of the Kel, the middle 
tower of the house — black-robed 
men and a black-robed woman, a 
circle of ten. Warriors, they played 
the round not like children, with a 
pair of stones, but with the spinning 
blades of the as-ei, which could 
wound, or kill. On the name-beat, 
the snap of fingers, the as-ei flew 
across the seated circle of players 
and skilled hands seized the hilts in 
mid-tum, to beat the time and hurl 
the blades on in the next name-beat. 

Fire-child, star-child, what is 
Kel? 

Sword-bearers, song-weavers, 
that is Kel. 

They played without words, with 
only the rhythm of their hands and 
the weapons, flesh and steel. The 
rhythm was as old as time and as 
familiar as childhood. The game 
had more meaning than the act, 
more than the simplicity implied by 
the words. The Game of the People, 
it was called. 



Dawn-child, earth-child, what 
is Sen? 

Rune-makers, home-leaders, 
that is Sen. 

A kel’en who flinched, whose 
eye failed or whose wits wandered, 
had no value in the House. The 
boys and girls and women of the 
Kath played with stones, to leant 
their skill. Those who became 
kel’ein played thereafter with edged 
steel. The Kel, like the mothers and 
children of the gentle Kath, laughed 
as they played. They of Kel-caste 
were brief and bright as moths. 
They enjoyed life because they 
knew this. 

Then-child, now-child, what 
are we? 

Dream-seekers, life-bearers, 
we are — 

A door opened, echoing, the 
sound rolling through the hollows 
and depths of the tower. Sen Sathell 
broke in upon them, suddenly and 
without warning or courtesies. 

The rhythm ceased. The blades 
rested in the hands of Niun, the 
youngest kel’en. The Kel as a 
whole inclined their heads in respect 
to Sathell s’Delas, chief of Sen- 
caste, the scholars. Gold-robed he 
was, like light breaking into the 
dark hall of the martial Kel, and he 
was very old — the oldest man of all 
in the House. 

“Kel’anth,” he said quietly, ad- 
dressing Eddan, his counterpart in 
the Kel, “kel’ein, news has come. 
The rumor is that the war has end- 
ed. The regul have asked the hu- 
mans for peace.” 

There was utter silence. 



FADED SUN

Then an abrupt move. The as-ei 
whirred and buried points in the 
painted plaster of the far wall. 

The youngest kel’en rose and veil- 
ed himself, and stalked from the 
gathering, leaving shock in his 
wake. 

The sen’anth and the kel’anth 
looked at each other, old men and 
kinsmen, helpless in their distress. 

And from the deepest shadows 
one of the dusei — a brown, slope- 
shouldered mass larger than a 
man — stirred and rose, ambling 
forth into the light in that mournful, 
abstracted manner of dusei. It 
pushed its way irreverently between 
the two elders, thrusting its massive 
head at the kel’anth, who was its 
master, seeking comfort. 

Kel’anth Eddan patted the beast 
with age-smooth fingers and looked 
up at the old scholar who, outside 
the divisions of caste and duty, was 
his half-brother. 

“Is the news beyond any 
doubt?” he asked, the least trace of 
hope yet in his voice. 

“Yes. The source is regul official 
communications, no city rumor. It 
seems completely reliable.” Sathell 
gathered his robes about him and, 
tucking them between his knees, 
settled on the carpeted floor among 
the kel’ein, who eased aside to 
make room for him in their circle. 

They were, these ten, the elders 
of the House, save one. 

They were mri. 

In their tongue, when they so 
named themselves, they were 
merely saying that they were of the 
People. Their word for other species 
was tsi’mri, which meant not- 
people, and summed up mri 
philosophy, religion and the per- 



sonal attitudes of the elders at once. 

They were, as a species, golden- 
toned. Mri legends said that the 
People were bom of the sun. Skin, 
eyes, coarse shoulder-length manes, 
all were bronze or gold. Their 
hands and feet were narrow and 
long and they were a tall, slender 
race. Their senses, even in great 
age, were very keen, their hearing 
in particular most sensitive. Their 
golden eyes were lid-folded, 
double-lidded as well, for a nictitat- 
ing membrane acted on reflex to 
protect their vision against blowing 
dust. 

They were, as outsiders believed, 
a species of warriors of mer- 
cenaries — for outsiders saw the 
Kel, rarely the Sen and never the 
Kath. Mri served outsiders for 
hire — served the regul, the massive 
tsi’mri merchants native to Nurag of 
the star Mab. For many centuries 
mri kel’ein had hired out to protect 
regul commerce between-worlds, 
generally hired by one regul com- 
pany as defense against the ambi- 
tions and ruthlessness of a business 
rival, and mri had therefore fought 
against mri. 

Those years and that service had 
been good for the People, allowing 
this trying of one kel’en of a certain 
service against the kel’en of another 
in proper and traditional combat, as 
it had always been. Such trials-at- 
arms refined the strength of the 
People, eliminating the weak and 
unfit and giving honor to the strong. 
In those days the tsi’mri regul had 
recognized themselves to be incapa- 
ble of fighting and unskilled in 
planning strategies, and sensibly left 
all matters of conflict to the mri Kel 
to settle in the mri fashion. 



10 



GALAXY 




But for the last forty years mri 
had served all regul combined 
against all humans in a bitter and 
ugly conflict, lacking honor and 
empty of any satisfactions from the 
enemy. The mri elders were old 
enough to remember the life before, 
and knew therefore what changes 
had been wrought by the war. They 
were not pleased with them. Hu- 
mans were mass-fighters, animals of 
the herd, and understood no other 
way of war. Mri, who fought 
singly, had early suspected this, 
tested it with their lives, found it 
bitterly true. Humans rejected a ani, 
honorable combat, would not re- 
spect challenge, understood nothing 
but their own way, which was 
widespread destruction. 

Mri had bent themselves to learn 
humanity, the way of the enemy, 
and had begun to adjust their opera- 
tions and their manner of service to 
the regul accordingly. Mri were 
professionals when it came to com- 
bat. Innovation in the yin’ein, the 
ancient weapons that were used in 
a’ ani, was dishonorable and un- 
thinkable; but innovation in the za- 
hen’ein, in modem arms, was a 
simple matter of retooling and ad- 
justing methods, a matter of compe- 
tency in the profession they fol- 
lowed for a livelihood. 

Regul, unfortunately, were not as 
capable of adapting to new tactics. 
Regul had vast and accurate 
memories. They could not forget 
what had always occurred, but, 
conversely, they could hardly con- 
ceive of what had not yet happened, 
nor make plans against it happen- 
ing. Hitherto the regul had de- 
pended on mri entirely in the matter 
of their personal safety, and mri 



foresight — for mri could imagine — 
had shielded them and compensated 
for that regul blindness to the unex- 
pected; but in later days, when the 
war began to take regul lives and 
threaten regul properties, regul took 
matters into their own unskilled 
hands. Regul issued orders, prudent 
in their own estimation, for actions 
that were militarily impossible. 

The mri had attempted to obey, 
for honor’s sake. 

Mri had died in their thousands, 
for honor’s sake. 

In the House, on this world, there 
lived only thirteen mri. Two were 
young. The rest were the makers of 
policy, a council of the old, the 
veterans. Long centuries ago the 
House had numbered more than two 
thousand in the Kel alone. In this 
present age all but these few had 
gone their way to the war, to die. 

And their war had been lost, by 
regul, who had asked the humans 
for peace. 

Sathell looked about him and 
considered these old ones, kel’ein 
who had lived beyond their own 
years of service, whose memories 
gave them in some matters the 
perspective of sen’ein. They were 
Husbands to the she ’pan, masters- 
of-arms while there had been Kath- 
children to teach. And there was 
Pasev, the only surviving kel’e’en 
of the House, she most skilled in 
yin’ein, next only to Eddan himself. 
There were Dahacha and Sirain of 
Nisren; Palazi and Quaras and Lieth 
of Guragen, itself a dead House, 
taking refuge with the Mother of 
this one and adopted by her as Hus- 
bands. And from yet another dead 
House were Liran and Debas, true- 
brothers. They were part of an age 



FADED SUN

that had already vanished, a time 
the People would not see again. 

Sathell felt their sadness, sensed 
it reflected in the beasts that hud- 
dled together in the shadows. Ed- 
dan’s dus, whose species was repu- 
tedly never friendly with any caste 
but the warrior Kel, sniffed criti- 
cally at the scholar’s gold robes and 
suffered himself to be touched, then 
heaved his great bulk a little closer, 
wrinkled rolls of down-furred flesh, 
shamelessly accepting affection 
where it was offered. 

“Eddan,” said Sathell, stroking 
the beast’s warm shoulder, “I must 
tell you also: It is very likely the 
masters will cede this world if the 
humans should demand it as part of 
the peace.” 

“That would be,” said Eddan, 
“a very large settlement.” 

“Not according to what we have 
just heard. It is rumored that the 
humans have secured the whole 
front, that the regul lords are in 
complete withdrawal, that the hu- 
mans are in such a position now 
that they can touch all the contested 
areas. They have taken Elag.” 

There was silence. Elsewhere in 
the tower a door closed. At last 
Eddan shrugged, a move of his 
slender fingers. 

“Then the humans will surely 
demand this world. There is very 
little they will miss in their desire 
for revenge. And the regul have left 
us open to it.” 

“It is incredible,” said Pasev. 
“Gods! there was no need, no need 
at all, for the regul to have aban- 
doned Elag. The People could have 
held there — could have turned the 
humans had they been given the 
equipment.” 



Sathell made a helpless gesture. 
“Perhaps. But held for whom? The 
regul withdrew, took everything that 
was needed there for the defense, 
pulled ships from under their con- 
trol. Now we — Kesrith — have be- 
come the border. You are right. It 
is very likely that the regul will not 
resist here either; in fact, it is not 
reasonable for them to do so. So we 
have done all that we could do. We 
have advised, we have warned — and 
if our employers refused to take that 
advice, there is little we can do but 
cover their retreat, since we cannot 
restrain them from it. They took the 
war into their own management a- 
gainst our advice. Now they have 
lost their war; we have not. The war 
ceased to be ours some years ago. 
You are guiltless, kel’ein. You may 
justly reckon so. There is simply 
nothing further that can be done.” 

“There was something once that 
might have been done,” Pasev in- 
sisted. 

“The Sen attempted many times 
to reason with the masters. We 
offered our services and our advice 
according to the ancient treaty. We 
could not — ” Sathell heard the 
footsteps of the youth downstairs as 
he spoke and the disturbance dis- 
rupted his train of thought. He 
glanced hallward involuntarily as 
the door downstairs slammed with 
great violence. The sound echoed 
throughout all the House. He cast 
the Kel a look of distress. 

“Should not one of you at least 
go speak with him?” 

Eddan shrugged, embarrassed in 
his authority. Sathell knew it. He 
presumed on kinship and friendship 
and stepped far out of bounds with 
Eddan when he made that protest.

He loved Niun; they all did. But the 
autonomy of the Kel, even mis- 
guided, was sacred regarding the 
discipline of its members. Only the 
Mother could interfere within Ed- 
dan’s province. 

“Niun has some small cause, do 
you not think?” asked Eddan 
quietly. “He has trained all his life 
toward this war. He is not a child 
of the old way, as we are; and now 
he cannot enter into the new either. 
You have taken something from 
him. What do you expect him to 
do, sen Sathell?” 

Sathell bowed his head, unable to 
dispute with Eddan in the matter, 
recognizing the truth in Eddan ’s 
words, trying to see things as a 
young kel’en might see them. One 
could not explain to the Kel, could 
not refute them in debate or expect 
foresight of them: children of a day, 
the kel’ein, brief and passionate, 
without yesterday and without to- 
morrow. Their ignorance was the 
price they paid for their freedom to 
leave the House and go among 
tsi’mri; and they knew their place. 
If a sen’en challenged them to rea- 
son, they must simply bow the 
head in their tum and retreat into si- 
lence; they had nothing with which 
to answer. And to destroy their 
peace of mind was unconscionable. 
Knowledge without power was the 
most bitter condition of all. 

“I think I have told you,” said 
Sathell at last, “all that I know to 
tell you at the moment. I will ad- 
vise you immediately if there is any 
further news.” 

He arose in the silence and 
smoothed his robes into order, gin- 
gerly avoiding the reflexive grasp of 
the dus. The beast reached at his 



ankle, harmless in intent but not in 
potential. The dusei were not to be 
treated with familiarity by any but a 
kel’en. He stopped and looked at 
Eddan, who with a touch rebuked 
the beast and freed the sen’anth. 

Sathell edged round the massive 
paw and cast a final look at Eddan, 
but Eddan looked away, affecting 
not to be interested any further in 
his departure. Sathell was not will- 
ing to press the matter publicly. He 
knew his half-brother and knew that 
the hurt was precisely because there 
was affection between them. There 
was a careful line drawn between 
them in public. When caste divided 
kinsmen, there had to be, to save 
the pride of the lesser. 

He gave a formal courtesy to the 
others and withdrew. He was glad 
to be out of that grim hall, heavy as 
the air was with the angers of frus- 
trated men, and of the dusei, whose 
rage was slower but more violent. 
He was relieved, nonetheless, that 
they had listened to all that he had 
said. There would be no violence, 
no irrational action, which was the 
worst thing to be feared from the 
Kel. They were old. The old might 
reason together in groups, might 
consult together. The kel’en was, in 
youth, a solitary warrior and reck- 
less, and without perspective. 

He thought of going after Niun 
but did not know what to say to 
him should he find him. His duty 
was to report elsewhere.

merely shrugged off the sen’anth. 
She had seen more years and more 
of war than any living warrior but 
Eddan himself. She played the 
game all the same, as did they all, 
including Eddan. It was a death as 
honorable as one in war. 

“Let us play it out,” she said. 

“No,” said Eddan firmly. “No. 
Not yet.” 

He caught her eyes as he spoke. 
She looked at him plainly, aged 
lover, aged rival, aged friend. Her 
slim fingers brushed the fine edge 
of the steel but she understood the 
order. 

“Aye,” she said, and the as-ei 
spun past Eddan’s shoulder to bury 
themselves in the painted map of 
Kesrith that decorated the east wall.

“The Kel bore the news,” said 
sen Sathell, “with more restraint 
than I expected of them. But it was 
not welcome all the same. They feel 
cheated. They perceive it as an af- 
front to their honor. And Niun left. 
He would not even hear it out. I do 
not know where he went. I am con- 
cerned. 

She ’pan Intel, the Lady Mother 
of the House and of the People, 
leaned back in her many cushions, 
ignoring a twinge of pain. The pain 
was an old companion. She had had 
it for forty-three years, since she 
lost her strength and her beauty at 
once in the fires of burning Nisren. 
Even then she had not been young. 
Even then she had been she ’pan of 
home world, ruler over all three 
castes of the People. She was of the 
first rank of the Sen, surpassing 
Sathell himself; she was above other 



she’panei as well, the few that still 
lived. She knew the Mysteries that 
were closed to others; she knew the 
name and nature of the Holy and of 
the Gods. The Pana, the Revered 
Objects, were in her keeping. She 
knew her nation to its depth and its 
width, its birth and its destiny. 

She was she’pan of a dying 
House, eldest Mother of a dying 
species. The Kath, the caste of 
child-bearers and children, was 
dead, its tower dark and closed 
twelve years ago. The last of the 
kath’ein was long buried in the 
cliffs of Sil’athen and the last chil- 
dren, motherless save for herself, 
had gone to their destinies outside. 
Her Kel had declined to ten, and 
the Sen. 

The Sen was before her: Sathell, 
the eldest, the sen’anth, whose 
weak heart ever poised him a beat 
removed from the Dark; and the girl 
who sat presently at her feet. They 
were the gold robes, the light- 
bearers, high-caste. Her own robes 
were white, untainted by the edg- 
ings of black and blue and gold 
worn by the she’panei of lesser de- 
gree. Their knowledge was almost 
complete but her own was entire. If 
her own heart should stop beating 
this moment, so much, so incalcu- 
lably much, could be lost to the 
People. It was a fearful thing to 
consider how much rested on her 
every pulse and breath. 

That the House and the People 
not die. 

The girl Melein looked up at 
her — last of all the children, Melein 
s’lntel Zain-Abrin, who had once 
been kel’e’en. At times the kel- 
fierceness still dwelt in Melein — 
although she had outwardly as- 



14 



GALAXY 




siimed the robes and the chaste se- 
renity of the scholarly Sen, although 
the years had given her different 
skills and her mind had advanced 
far beyond the simplicity of a 
kel’e’en. 

Intel brushed at Melein’s shoul- 
der, a faint caress. “Patience,” she 
advised, seeing Melein’s anxiety, 
and she knew that the advice would 
be discarded in all respects. 

“Let me go find Niun and talk to 
him,” Melein asked. 

Brother and sister, Niun and 
Melein — and close, despite that they 
had been separated by law and 
she’pan’s decree and caste and cus- 
tom. Kel’en and sen’e’en, dark and 
bright, Hand and Mind. But the 
heart in them was the same, and the 
blood was the same. Intel remem- 
bered the pair that had given them 
life: her youngest and most beloved 
Husband and a kel’e’en of Guragen, 
both lost now. His face, his eyes, 
that had made her regret a she’pan’s 
chastity, gazed back at her through 
Melein’s and Niun’s; and she re- 
membered that he also had been 
strong-willed and hot-tempered and 
clever. Perhaps Melein hated her; 
she had not willingly received the 
command to leave the Kel and enter 
the Sen. But there was no defiance 
to be seen now, though the she’pan 
searched for it. There was only anx- 
iety, only a natural grief for her 
brother’s pain. 

“No,” said Intel sharply. “I tell 
you to let him alone.” 

“He may harm himself, 
she’pan.” 

“He will not. You underestimate 
him. He does not need you now. 
You are no longer of the Kel and I 
doubt that he wants to be faced by 



one of the Sen at this moment. 
What could you tell him? What 
could you answer if he asked you 
questions? Could you be silent?” 

The words struck home. “He 
wanted to leave Kesrith six years 
ago,” said Melein, her eyes bright 
with unshed tears; and possibly it 
was not only her brother’s case she 
pleaded now, but her own. “You 
would not let him go. Now it is too 
late, she’pan. It is forever too late 
for him, and what can he imagine 
for himself? What is there left for 
him?” 

“Meditate upon these things,” 
said Intel, “and tell me your con- 
clusions, sen Melein s’lntel, after 
you have thought a day and a night 
on this matter. But do not intrude 
your advice into the private affairs 
of a kel’en. And do not regard him 
as your brother. A sen’e’en has no 
kin but the whole House, and the 
People.” 

Melein rose and stared down at 
her, breast heaving with her strug- 
gle for breath. Beautiful, this 

daughter of hers. Intel saw her in 
this instant and was amazed at how 
much Melein, who was not of her 
blood, had become the things her 
own youth had once promised — saw 
minrored her own self — before Nis- 
ren’s fall, before the ruin of the 
House and of her own hopes. The 
sight wounded her. In this moment 
she saw clearly, and knew the 
sen’e’en as she was, and at once 
feared her and loved her. 

Melein, who would hardly mourn 
her passing. 

So she had created her, deliber- 
ately, event by event, choice by 
choice, her daughter-not-of-the- 
flesh, her child, her Chosen, formed

in Kath and Kel and Sen, partaker 
of the Mysteries of all castes of the 
People. 

Hating her. 

“Leam restraint,” the she ’pan 
earnestly advised in a still, soft 
voice that thrust with difficulty into 
Melein’s anger. ‘Leam to be 
sen’e’en, Melein, above all else that 
you desire to have.” 

The young sen’e’en let go a 
shuddering breath and the tears in 
her eyes spilled over. Thwarted for 
now, the sen’e’en was for a mo- 
ment child again; but this child was 
dangerous. 

Intel shivered, foreknowing that 
Melein would outlive her and im- 
pose her own imprint on the world. 

II 

There was a division in the 
world, marked by a causeway of 
white rock. On the one side, and at 
the lower end, lay the regul of 
Kesrith — city folk, slow-moving, 
long-remembering. The lowland city 
was entirely theirs: flat sprawling 
buildings, a port, commerce with 
the stars, mining that scarred the 
earth, a plant that extracted water 
from the Alkaline Sea. The land 
had been called the Dus-plain be- 
fore there were regul on Kesrith, 
the mri remembered. For this reason 
the mri had avoided the plain, in re- 
spect of the dusei; but the regul had 
insisted to set their city there, and 
the dusei had left it. 

Uplands, in the rugged hills at 
the other end of the causeway, was 
the tower of the mri. It appeared as 
four truncated cones arising from 
the corners of a trapezoidal ground 
floor — slanted walls made of the 



pale earth of the lowlands, treated 
and hardened. This was the Edun 
Kesrithun, the House of Kesrith, the 
home of the mri of Kesrith and, be- 
cause of Intel, the home of all mri 
in the wide universe. 

One could see most of Kesrithi 
civilization from the vantage point 
Niun occupied in his solitary anger. 
He came here often, to this highest 
part of the causeway, to this stub- 
born outcrop of rock that had de- 
feated the regul road and made the 
regul think otherwise about their 
plans to extend it into the high hills, 
invading the sanctity of Sil’athen. 

Niun liked it for what it was as 
well as for the view. Below him lay 
the regul city and the mri edun, two 
very small scars on the body of the 
white earth. Above him, in the 
hills, and beyond and beyond, there 
were only regul automatons that 
drew minerals from the earth and 
provided regul Kesrith its reason for 
existence; and wild things that had 
owned the world before the coming 
of regul or of mri; and the slow- 
moving dusei that had once been 
Kesrith’s highest form of life. 

Niun sat brooding on the rock 
that overlooked the world, hating 
tsi’mri with more than the ordinary 
hatred of mri for aliens, which was 
considerable. He was twenty-six 
years old as the People reckoned 
years, which was not by Kesrith’s 
orbit around Arain, nor by the stand- 
ard of Nisren, nor by that of either 
of the two other worlds the People 
had designated homeworld in the 
span of time remembered by Kel 
songs. 

He was tall, even for his kind. 
His high cheekbones bore the set’ al, 
the triple scars of his caste, blue- 



16 



GALAXY 




stained and indelible. This meant 
that he was a full-fledged member 
of the Kel, the Hand of the People. 
Being of the Kel, he went robed 
from collar to boot-tops in unre- 
lieved black; and black veil and tas- 
seled headcloth, mez and zaidhe, 
concealed all but his brow and his 
eyes from the gaze of outsiders 
when he chose to meet them; and 
the zaidhe further had a dark, trans- 
parent visor that could meet the veil 
when dust blew or red Arain 
reached its unpleasant zenith. 

He was a man: His face, like his 
thoughts, was considered a private 
identity, one indecent to reveal to 
strangers. The veils enveloped him 
as did the robes, a distinguishing 
mark of the only caste of the People 
that might deal with outsiders. The 
black robes, the siga, were held 
about the waist and chest with belts 
that bore his weapons, which were 
several; and they should also have 
held j’tai, medallions, honors won 
for his services to the People. They 
held none, and this lack of status 
would have been obvious to any mri 
who beheld him. 

Being of the Kel, he could 
neither read nor write, save that he 
could use a numbered keyboard and 
he knew mathematics, both regul 
and mri. He knew by heart the 
complicated genealogies of his 
House, which had been that of Nis- 
ren. The name-chants filled him 
with melancholy when he sang 
them: It could not be otherwise 
when he must look about the crack- 
ing walls of Edun Kesrithun and 
behold only so few people as now 
lived and realize that decline was 
taking place, that it was real and 
threatening. He knew all the songs. 



He could foresee begetting no child 
of his own who would sing them, 
not on Kesrith. He had learned the 
songs; he had learned the languages 
that were part of the Kel-lore. He 
spoke four languages fluently, two 
of which were his own, one of 
which was the regul’s, and the 
fourth of which was the enemy’s. 
He was expert in weapons, both the 
yin’ein and the zahen’ein; he was 
taught of nine masters-of-arms; he 
knew that his skill was great in all 
these things. 

And wasted, all wasted. 

Regul. 

Tsi’mri. 

Niun flung a rock downslope, 
which splashed into a hot pool and 
disturbed the vapors. 

Peace. 

Peace on human terms, it would 
be. Regul had disregarded mri 
strategists at every crucial moment 
of the war. Regul would spend mri 
lives without stinting and they 
would pay the bloodprice to edunei 
that lost sons and daughters of the 
Kel, all because some regul colonial 
official panicked and ordered sui- 
cidal attack by the handful of mri 
serving him personally, to cover his 
retreat and that of his younglings; 
but far less willingly would that 
same regul risk regul lives or prop- 
erties. To lose regul lives would 
mean loss of status; it would have 
brought that regul instant censure by 
regul authorities, recall to 
homeworld, sifting of his knowl- 
edge, death of himself and his 
young in all probability. 

It was inevitable that humans 
should have realized this essential 
weakness of the regul-mri partner- 
ship, that humans should have 



FADED SUN 



17 




learned that inflicting casualties on 
regul would have far more effect 
than inflicting those same casualties 
on mri. 

It was predictable then that the 
regul should have panicked under 
that pressure, that they would have 
reacted by retreat, precipitous, 
against all mri counsel to the con- 
trary, exposing world after world to 
attack in their haste to withdraw to 
absolute security. Consequently that 
absolute security could not exist. 

And that regul would afterward 
compound their stupidity by dealing 
directly with the humans — this too 
was credible in the regul — to buy 
and sell war, and to sell out quickly 
when threatened rather than risk los- 
ing overmuch of their necessary 
possessions. 

The regul language contained no 
word for courage. 



Neither had it one for imagina- 
tion. 

The war was ending and Niun 
remained worldbound, never having 
put to use the things that he had 
learned. The Gods knew what man- 
ner of trading the merchants were 
doing, what disposition was being 
made of his life. He foresaw that 
things might revert to what they had 
been before the war, that mri might 
again serve individual regul — that 
mri would fight mri again, in com- 
bat where experience mattered. 

And Gods knew how long it 
would be possible to find a regul to 
serve, when the war was ending and 
conditions were entering a period of 
flux. Gods knew how likely a regul 
was to take on an inexperienced 
kel’en to guard his ship when 
others, war-wise, were available. 

He had trained all his life to fight

humans and now the policies of 
three species conspired to keep him 
from it. 

He rose up of a sudden, mind set 
on an idea that had been seething 
within for more than this day alone, 
and he leaped to the ground and 
started walking down the road. He 
did not look back when he had 
passed the edun, unchallenged, un- 
noticed. He owned nothing. He 
needed nothing. What he wore and 
what he carried as his weapons 
were his to take; he had these by 
law and custom, and he could ask 
nothing more of his edun even were 
he leaving with its blessing and 
help, which he was not. 

In the edun Melein would surely 
grieve at such a silent desertion, but 
she had been kel’e’en herself long 
enough to be glad for his sake that 
he went to a service. A kel’en in an 
edun was as impermanent as the 
wind itself and ought to own no 
close ties past childhood, save to 
the she ’pan and to the People and to 
him or her that hired him. 

He did feel a certain guilt toward 
the she’pan, to her who had 
mothered him with a closeness 
much beyond what a she’pan owed 
a son of her Husbands. He knew 
that she had particularly favored 
Zain, his father, and still mourned 
his death; and she would neither 
approve nor allow the journey he 
made now. 

It was, in fact, Intel’s stubborn, 
possessive will that had held him 
this long on Kesrith, kept him at 
her side long past the years that he 
decently should have left her author- 
ity and that of his teachers. He had 
once loved Intel, deeply, reverently. 
Even that love, in the slow years 



since he should have followed the 
other kel’ein of the edun and left 
her, had begun to tum to bitterness. 

Thanks to her, his skills were un- 
tried, his life unused and now 
perhaps altogether useless. Nine 
years had passed since the seta’al of 
the Kel had been cut and stained 
into his face, nine years that he had 
sat in heart-pounding longing 
whenever a regul master would 
come up the road to the edun and 
seek a kel’en to guard a ship, be it 
for the war or even for commerce. 
Fewer and fewer these requests 
came in the passing years, and now 
there came no more requests to the 
edun at all. He was the last of all 
his brothers and sisters of the Kel, 
last of all the children of the edun 
save Melein. The others had all 
found their service, and most were 
dead; but Niun s’lntel, nine years a 
kel’en, had yet to leave the 
she’pan’s protective embrace. 

Mother, let me go! he had begged 
of her six years ago, when his 
cousin Medai’s ship had left — the 
ultimate, the crushing, shame that 
Medai — swaggering, boastful Medai 
— should be chosen for the greatest 
honor of all, and he be left behind 
in disgrace. 

No, the she’pan had said in the 
absolute, invoking her authority; 
and to his repeated pleading for her 
understanding, for his freedom: No. 
You are the last of all my sons, the 
last, the last l shall ever have. 
Zain' s child. And if I will you to 
stay with me, that is my right, and 
that is my final decision. No. No. 

He had fled to the high hills that 
day, watching and not wishing to 
watch as the ship of the regul high 
command, Hazan, which ruled the 



20 



GALAXY 




zone in which Kesrith lay, bore 
Medai s’Intel Sov-Nelan into man- 
hood, into service, into the highest 
honor that had yet befallen a kel’en 
of Edun Kesrithun. 

That day Niun had wept, though 
kel’ein could not weep. And then in 
shame at this weakness, he had 
scoured his face with the harsh 
powdery sand and stayed fasting in 
the hills for another day and two 
nights, until he had had to come 
down and face the other kel’ein and 
the Mother’s anxious and possessive 
love. 

Old, all of them. There was not a 
kel’en now save himself that could 
take a service even if it were 
offered. They were all greatly skill- 
ed. He suspected that they were the 
greatest masters of the yin’ein in all 
the People, although they did not 
boast anything but considerable 
competency; but the years had done 
their subtle robbery and left them 
no strength to use their arts in war. 
It was a Kel of eight men and one 
woman past their reason for living, 
without strength to fight or — after 
him — children to teach: old ones 
whose dreams must now be all 
backward. 

Nine years they had stolen from 
him, entombing him with them, liv- 
ing their vicarious lives through his 
youth. 

He walked the road down to the 
lowlands, letting the causeway take 
him to regul, since regul would not 
come to the edun in these days. It 
was not the most direct route but it 
was the easiest, and he walked it 
insolently secure since the old ones 
of the Kel could not possibly over- 
take him on so long a walk. He did 
not mean to go to the port, which 

FADED SUN 



was directly crosslands, but to what 
lay at the causeway’s end, the very 
center of regul authority, the Nom, 
that two-storied building that was 
the highest structure in Kesrith ’s 
only city. 

★ ★ ★ 

He felt uneasy when his boots 
trod concrete and he found all about 
him the ugly, flat buildings of re- 
gul. Here was a different world 
from the cleanliness of the high 
hills; even a different smell in the 
air, a blunting of the acrid flavor of 
Kesrith’s chill winds, a subtle 
effluvium of oil and machinery and 
musky regul bodies. 

Regul younglings watched him — 
the mobile ones, the young of 
regul. Their squat bodies would 
thicken further in adulthood, their 
grayish-brown skins darken, loosen; 
fat would accumulate until they 
found themselves enveloped in 
weight almost too great for their at- 
rophying muscles to lift. Mri sel- 
dom saw elder regul: Niun himself 
had never seen an elder in the flesh; 
only heard them described by his 
teachers of the Kel. Adult regul 
kept to their city, surrounded by 
machines that carried them, that 
purified their air; they were attended 
by younglings that must wait on 
them constantly, who themselves 
lived precarious lives until they 
chanced to reach maturity. The only 
violence regul perpetrated was 
against their own young. 

The younglings on the square 
looked at him now in sidelong 
glances and talked in secretive tones 
that carried to his sensitive hearing, 
more clearly surely than they re- 



21 




alized possible. Ordinarily this 
spitefulness would not have troubled 
him in the least: He had been taught 
less liking for them and despised 
them and all their breed. But here 
he was the petitioner, desperately 
anxious, and they held what he 
wanted and had the power to deny 
it to him. Their hatred breathed 
about him like the tainted city at- 
mosphere. 

He had veiled himself long before 
he entered the town; but with a little 
more encouragement, he would 
have dropped the visor of the zaidhe 
also. He had done so on his last 
visit to this city, being a very young 
kel’en and uncertain of the pro- 
prieties of conduct between regul and 
mri. But now, older, a man in his 
own right, he had the face to leave 
the visor up and glare back at the 
younglings who stared too boldly; 
and most could not bear the direct 
contact with his eyes and flinched 
from meeting them. A few, older 
and braver than the others, hissed 
soft displeasure, warning. He ig- 
nored them. He was not a regul 
youngling, to fear their violence. 

He knew his way. He knew the 
Norn’s proper entrance, fronting the 
great square around which the city 
was built in concentric squares. It 
faced the rising sun, as main en- 
trances of central regul buildings 
must. He remembered this. He had 
been here as escort to his father, 
who was about to take his last serv- 
ice; but he had not been inside. 
Now he came to the door before 
which he had waited on that day, 
and at his presence the regul 
youngling on duty in the vestibule 
rose in alarm. 

“Go away,” said the youngling 



flatly; but Niun paid no attention to 
it and walked into the main foyer of 
the echoing place, at once stifled by 
the heat and the musky flavor of the 
air. He found himself in a great 
area surrounded by doors and win- 
dowed offices, all with titles written 
on them; he was quickly sick and 
dizzy from the air; and he stood 
confused and ashamed in the middle 
of the hall, for here it was a matter 
of reading to know where he must 
go next, and he could not read. 

It was the regul youngling from 
the vestibule desk that came to him 
in his distress, stumping across the 
floor in short, scuffing steps. The 
youngling was flushed dark with 
anger, or with the heat, and breath- 
ing heavily from the exertion of 
overtaking Niun. 

“Go away,” the youngling re- 
peated. “By treaty and by law, you 
have no business coming here.” 

“I will speak to your elders,” 
Niun told the youngling. This, he 
had been taught, was the ultimate 
and unanswerable appeal among re- 
gul: No youngling could make an 
ultimate decision. “Tell them that a 
kel’en is here to speak with them.” 

The youngling blew air, flutter- 
ing, through its nostrils. “Come 
with me then,” it said, and cast 
him a disapproving glance, a flash 
of white, red-veined, from the 
comer of a rolling eye. 

It was — it, for regul could not de- 
termine their own gender until 
maturity — like all regul, a squat 
figure, body almost touching the 
floor even while it was standing. It 
was also a very young regul to have 
been given the (among regul) con- 
siderable honor of tending the Nom 
door. It still bore itself erect, bones

showing through the skin, the 
brown pebbly hide fine-grained yet 
and delicate with beige tones and a 
casting of metallic highlights, It 
walked beside him, a rolling gait 
that needed considerable leeway. 

“I am Hada Surag-gi,” it said, 
“secretary, guardian to the door. 
You are doubtless one of Intel’s 
lot.” 

Niun did not answer this rudeness 
on the part of the tsi’mri guard, 
naming the she’pan by her name 
with such insolent familiarity. 
Among regul, elders would be the 
reverence, or the honorable, or the 
lord. .and he reckoned the famil- 
iarity for calculated insult, mark- 
ing it down for a later date, if it so 
happened he found himself holding 
what Hada Surag-gi desired. The 
youngling at present was doing what 
he wanted it to do and this, between 
mri and tsi’mri, was sufficient. 

Steel tracks ran the bowed edges 
of the walls, and a vehicle whis- 
pered past them at a speed so great 
the presence was only an instant. 
The tracks went everywhere on the 
wall opposite the doors, and another 
and another vehicle passed, missing 
one another by a hand’s breadth. He 
did not let himself appear amazed at 
such things. 

And neither did he thank the 
youngling when it had shown him 
through a door and into a waiting 
room where another, seemingly 
adult, kept a metal desk; he simply 
turned his back on the youngling 
when it had ceased to be of use, 
and heard it leave. 

The official leaned back from its 
desk, cradling its body in the 
mobile chair that — amazingly — 

moved under power: another such 



vehicle, a gleaming steel device 
such as he had heard the adult regul 
used to move about without rising. 

“We know you,” the regul said. 
“You are Niun, from the Hill. Your 
elders have contacted us. You are 
ordered to return to your people 
immediately.” 

Heat rushed to his face. Of 
course they would have done this, 
forestalling him. He had not even 
thought of it. 

“That does not matter,” he said, 
carefully formal. “I am asking serv- 
ice with your ships. I renounce my 
edun.” 

The regul, a brown mass, folded 
and over-folded, its face a surpris- 
ing bony smoothness within this 
weight, sighed and regarded him 
with small, wrinkle-edged eyes. 

“We hear what you say,” it said. 
“But our treaty with your folk does 
not permit us to accept you with 
your elders protesting. Please return 
to them at once. We do not want to 
quarrel with your elders.” 

“Do you have a superior?” Niun 
asked harshly, out of patience and 
fast losing hope as well. “Let me 
speak to someone of higher author- 
ity.” 

“You ask to see the Director?” 

“Yes.” 

The regul sighed again and made 
the request of an intercom. A grat- 
ing voice refused, flatly. The regul 
looked up, rolling its eyes in an ex- 
pression that was more satisfied and 
smug than apologetic. “You see,” 
it said. 

Niun turned on his heel and 
strode oitt of the office and out of 
the foyer, ignoring the amused eyes 
of the youngling Hada Surag-gi. He 
felt his face burning, his breath

short, as he exited the warm interior 
of the Nom and walked onto the 
public square, where the cold wind 
swept through the city. 

He walked swiftly as if he had a 
place to go and went there of his 
own will. He imagined that every 
regul on the street knew his shame 
and was laughing secretly. This was 
not beyond all possibility, for regul 
tended to know everyone’s busi- 
ness. 

He did not slow his pace until he 
was walking the long causeway 
back from the city’s edge toward 
the edun, and then indeed he 
walked slowly and cared little for 
what passed his eyes or his hearing 
on the road. The open land, even 
on the causeway, was not a place 
where it was safe to go inattentive 
to surroundings, but he did so, 
tempting the Gods and the she ’pan’s 
anger. He was sorry that nothing 
did befall him and that, after all, he 
found himself walking the familiar 
earthen track to the entrance of the 
edun and entering its shadows and 
its echoes. He was sullen still as he 
walked to the stairs of the Kel 
tower and ascended, pushing open 
the door of the hall, reporting to 
kel’anth Eddan, dutiful prisoner. 

“I am back,” he said, and did 
not unveil. 

Eddan had the rank and the self- 
righteousness to turn a naked face 
to his anger, and the self-possession 
to remain unstirred. 

Old man, old man, Niun could 
not help thinking, the seta’al are 
one with the wrinkles on your face, 
and your eyes are dimmed so that 
they already look into the Dark. 
You will keep me here until I am 
like you. Nine years, nine years, 



Eddan, and you have made me lose 
my dignity. What can you take from 
me in nine more? 

“You are back,” echoed Eddan, 
who had been his principal teacher- 
in-arms and who adopted that 
master-student manner with him. 
“What of it?” 

Niun carefully unveiled, settled 
crosslegged to the floor near the 
warmth of the dus that slept in the 
corner. It eased aside, murmured a 
rumbling complaint at the disturb- 
ance of its sleep. 

“I would have gone,” he said. 
“You distressed the she’pan,” 
Eddan said. “You will not go down 
to the city again. She forbids it.” 
Niun looked up, outraged. 

“You embarrassed the House,” 
Eddan said. “Consider that.” 

“Consider me!” Niun exclaimed, 
exhausted. He saw the shock his 
outburst created in Eddan and cast 
the words out in reckless satisfac- 
tion: “It is unnatural, what you 
have done, keeping me here. I am 
due something in my life — 
something of my own, at least.” 
“Are you?” Eddan’s soft voice 
was edged. “Who taught you that? 
Some regul in the city?” 

Eddan stood still, hands within 
his belt, old master of the yin’ein, 
in that posture that chilled a man 
who knew its meaning: Here is 
challenge, if you want it. Niun 
loved Eddan. That Eddan looked at 
him in this way frightened him; 
made him reckon his skill against 
Eddan’s; made him remember that 
Eddan could still humble him. 
There was a difference between 
himself and the old master, that if 
Eddan’s bluff were called, blood 
would flow for it. And Eddan knew 



24 



GALAXY 




that difference in them. Heat rose to 
Niun’s face. 

“I never asked to be treated dif- 
ferently than all the others,” he de- 
clared, averting his face from Ed- 
dan’s challenge. 

“What do you think you are 
due?” Eddan asked him. 

He could not answer. 

“You have a soft spot in your 
defense,” said Eddan. “A gaping 
hole. Go and consider that, Niun 
s’Intel, and when you have made up 
your mind what it is the People owe 
you, come and tell me and we will 
go to the Mother and present your 
case to her.” 

Eddan mocked him. The bitter 
thing was that he deserved it. He 
saw that this over-anxiousness was 
what had shamed him before the re- 
gul. He resumed the veil and 
gathered himself to his feet. 

“You have duties that are wait- 
ing,” Eddan said sharply. “Dinner 
was held without you. Go and assist 
Liran at cleaning up. Tend to your 
own obligations before you consider 
what is owed to you.” 

“Sir,” Niun said quietly, averted 
his face again and went his way 
below. 

Ill 

The ship, a long voyage out from 
Elag/Haven, had shifted to the 
tedium that had possessed it before 
transition. Sten Duncan took a sec- 
ond look at the mainroom display 
and was disappointed to discover it 
had not yet noted the change. They 
had spent the longest normal-space 
passage he had ever endured getting 
out of Haven’s militarily sensitive 
vicinity, blind and under tedious es- 

FADED SUN 



cort. That was suddenly gone. It 
was replaced by another passage 
likely as tedious. He shrugged and 
kept walking. The place smelled of 
regul. He held his breath as he 
passed the galley-automat, the door 
of which was open. He kept to the 
center of the corridor, scarcely no- 
ticing as a sled whisked past him: 
The corridors were built wide, high 
in the center and low on the sides, 
with gleaming rails recessed into the 
flooring to guide the conveyance 
sleds that carried the regul about the 
long corridors of their ship. 

It was not possible to forget for 
an instant that this ship was regul. 
The corridors did not angle or bow 
as they would in a human-made 
vessel; they wound, spiraled, amen- 
able to the gliding course of the 
sleds that hugged the walls, and 
only a few of them could be 
walked. In those designed for walk- 
ing, there was headroom in their 
center for humans — or for mri, who 
were the ordinary tenants of regul 
ships — but tracks ran the sides for 
regul. 

And about the whole ship there 
were strange scents, strange aromas 
of unpalatable food and spices, 
strange sounds, the rumbling tones 
of regul language that neither hu- 
mans nor probably even mri had 
ever pronounced as regul might. 

He loathed it. He loathed the 
regul utterly, and knowing that that 
reaction was neither wise nor help- 
ful in his position, he constantly 
fought against his instincts. It was 
clear enough that the reaction was 
mutual with the regul; they 
restricted their human guests to six 
hours in which they were sup- 
posedly free to roam the personnel 



25 




areas to their hearts’ content; and 
after that came a twenty-two-hour 
period of confinement. 

Sten Duncan, aide to the Honor- 
able George Stavros — governor-to- 
be in the new territories and pres- 
ently liaison between regul and 
humanity — regularly availed himself 
of that six-hour liberty; the Honor- 
able Mr. Stavros did not. He did 
not, in fact, venture from his own 
room. Duncan walked the corridors 
and gathered the appropriate mate- 
rials and releases from the library 
for the honorable gentleman to read 
and carried to the pneumatic dis- 
patch whatever communications 
flowed from Stavros to Stavros’ 
regul counterpart, bai Hulagh 
Alagn-ni. 

Regul protocol. No regul elder 
of dignity performed his own er- 
rands — only a condemned incom- 
petent lacked youngling servitors. 
Therefore no human of Stavros’ 
rank would do so; and therefore 
Stavros had chosen an aide of appar- 
ent youth and fairly advanced rank, 
criteria that regul would use in 
selecting their own personal attend- 
ants. 

He was, in effect, a servant. He 
provided Stavros a certain prestige. 
He ran errands. Back in the action 
that had taken Haven, he had held 
military rank. The regul knew this, 
which further enhanced Stavros’ 
prestige. 

Duncan gathered up the day’s 
communications, left others from 
Stavros on the appropriate table and 
delivered the food order to the slot 
that ultimately would find its way to 
the correct department, sending an 
automated carrier to their door with 
the requested meal — at least as 



regul construed it — of the human- 
supplied foodstuffs that had come 
with them. 

Like exotic pets, Duncan re- 
flected with annoyance, with the 
regul trying, as far as convenient, to 
maintain an authentic environment. 
As in most wild-animal displays, 
the staging was transparently artifi- 
cial. 

He retraced his way down the 
hall, through the mainroom recrea- 
tion area and library. He had never 
set eyes on any of the regul save 
the younglings that frequented this 
central personnel relaxation area. 
Curiously enough, neither had Stav- 
ros encountered Hulagh. Protocol 
again. It was likely that, in all the 
time they had yet to spend among 
regul, they would never meet the 
Honorable, the Reverence, bai 
Hulagh Alagn-ni, but only the 
younglings that served him as crew 
and aides and messengers. 

Regul elders were virtually im- 
mobile; this was certain; and 
Hulagh was said to be of very ex- 
treme age. Duncan privately sur- 
mised that this helplessness was a 
source of embarrassment to the el- 
derly regul in dealing face to face 
with non-regul and that therefore 
they arranged to keep themselves in 
total seclusion from outsiders. 

Or perhaps they judged humans 
and mri unbearably ugly. It was cer- 
tain that there was little that humans 
could find beautiful in the regul. 

He opened the unlocked door that 
let him into the double suite he 
shared with Stavros. The anteroom 
was his, serving as sleeping quarters 
and all else he was supposed to de- 
sire during the long passage: regul 
revenge, he thought sourly, for 



26 



GALAXY 




human insistence on the long, slow 
escort. Both the reception salon and 
proper bedroom belonged to Stav- 
ros. So did the sanitary facilities, 
which were in the adjoining bed- 
room and likewise not designed for 
human comfort: He wondered how 
Stavros, elderly as he was, coped 
with that. But it had not been deem- 
ed wise to make an issue of regul- 
human differences even in that 
detail. The theory was that the regul 
were honoring their guests by treat- 
ing them precisely as if they were 
regul, down to the tradition of deal- 
ing only through youngling inter- 
mediaries and the tradition that 
placed Duncan’s quarters uncom- 
fortably in the tiny anteroom be- 
tween Stavros and the outer cor- 
ridor. 

Precious encouragement for con- 
fidence in regul civilization, Duncan 
thought sourly, when he thought 
about it; he was to defend the 
honorable human gentleman from 
harm, from contact with rude out- 
siders, from all unpleasantness. It 
seemed no insult to regul hospitality 
to assume that such rudenesses 
might be anticipated. 

And Stavros remained a virtual 
prisoner of his exalted rank, pent 
within one room, with no contact 
with the outside save himself. 

Duncan sealed the outer door and 
knocked on the inner, a formality 
preserved necessarily — first, be- 
cause listening regul (assuming 
regul listened, which he and Stavros 
firmly believed) would not under- 
stand any informality between elder 
and youngling; and second, because 
they had been at close quarters too 
long and cherished what privacy 
each could obtain. 



The door opened, controlled by 
Stavros’ remote devices. It was in- 
congruous to see a human, espe- 
cially a frail and slight one, sitting 
in the massive chair-sled designed 
for regul elders. Desk, control 
center, mode of transportation: 
Stavros disdained to propel it across 
the room. Duncan went to him, pre- 
sented the tapes and papers and 
Stavros took them from him and 
began to deal with them at once, all 
without a smile or word of greeting 
or even a dismissal. Stavros had 
smiled a few times at the beginning 
of their association; he did not now. 
They lived under the continual wit- 
ness of the regul. Duncan was 
treated, he suspected, as if he were 
in truth a regul youngling, without 
courtesy and without consideration 
of himself as an individual. He 
hoped, at least, that this was the 
source of Stavros’ coldness to him. 

He knew that he was far from 
understanding such a man. He saw 
some qualities in Stavros that he re- 
spected: courage, for one. He 

thought that it must have taken a 
great deal of that to enter on such a 
mission at Stavros’ age. An elderly 
human had been wanted, a diplomat 
who, aside from his duties as ad- 
ministrator of the new territories, 
could obtain greater respect from 
the regul that would be neighbors to 
humanity. Stavros had come out of 
retirement to take the assignment 
— not a strong man, nor an imposing 
one physically. He was, Duncan 
had learned in their only inti- 
mate conversation — and that before 
boarding — a native of Kiluwa, one 
of the several casualties of the 
war in its earliest years; and that 
might explain something. 



FADED SUN 



27 




Kiluwans were legendarily eccen- 
tric, of a fringe-area colony left too 
long on its own, peculiar in reli- 
gion, in philosophy, in manners: 
like the regul, they had not believed 
in writing. For the years after Kilu- 
wa’s fall, Stavros had been in the 
XenBureau; of late retired to uni- 
versity life. He had children, had 
lost a grandson to the war at 
Haven/Elag. If Stavros hated regul 
either for Kiluwa or for the grand- 
son’s sake, he had never betrayed 
it. He seldom betrayed any emotion 
beyond a certain obsessive interest 
in the regul. Everything in Stavros 
was quiet, and there were depths 
and depths beneath that placidity. 

Suddenly the old man’s pale eyes 
flashed up. “Good morning, Dun- 
can,” he said and instantly returned 
to his studies. “Sit,” he added. 
“Wait.” 

Duncan sat down, disappointed, 
and waited. He had nothing else to 
do. He would have gone mad al- 
ready had he not had the ability to 
bear long silence and inactivity. He 
watched Stavros work, wondering 
again why the old man had so de- 
termined to leam the regul tongue, 
a task that occupied his many 
hours. There were regul who spoke 
perfectly idiomatic Basic. There al- 
ways would be. But Stavros had 
succeeded well enough on their 
voyage that now he could listen to 
the tape from the regul master of 
.the ship, outlining the day’s 
schedules and providing informa- 
tion, and need glance only occa- 
sionally at the supplied written 
translation — regul propaganda, prais- 
ing the elders of homeworld, Nurag, 
praising the correct management 
of the director of the ship. Duncan 



found it all very dry, save for 
the small hints of the progress the 
ship was making. 

But from such things Stavros 
learned, and he became fluent at 
least in trivial courtesies — learned at 
a rate that began to amaze Duncan. 
The old man could actually under- 
stand that confusion of sound, 
which remained only confusion to 
Duncan. 

Such a man, a scholar, an in- 
telligent man, with grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren, had left 
everything human and familiar, ev- 
erything his long life had produced, 
and now took a voyage with the 
enemy, into unknown space. Al- 
though a governorship was a con- 
siderable inducement, the hazards 
for Stavros were more than consid- 
erable. Duncan did not know how 
old the man was; there had been 
rumors at Haven verging on the in- 
credible. He did know that one of 
the great-grandchildren was enter- 
ing the military. 

If Duncan had enjoyed any inti- 
macy with Stavros, he would have 
been moved to ask him why he had 
come; he dared not. But every time 
he was tempted to give way to the 
pressures of their confinement, of 
his own fear of the strangeness 
about them, he thought of the old 
man patiently at his lessons and re- 
signed himself to last it out. 

He did not think that he contri- 
buted anything to Stavros, be it 
companionship or service, only the 
necessary appearance of propriety in 
the regul’ s eyes. Stavros could have 
done without him, for all the notice 
he paid him. Personnel had chosen 
half a dozen men for interview and 
he, one of the Surface Tactical 



28 



GALAXY 




officers at Haven, had been the 
choice. He still did not know why. 
He had admitted to his lack of qual- 
ifications for such a post. Then he’ll 
know that he has to take orders, 
Stavros had concluded in his pres- 
ence. Volunteer? Stavros had asked 
him then, as if this were a point of 
suspected insanity. No, sir, he had 
answered— the truth: They called in 
every SurTac in the Haven reach. 
Pilot’s rating? Stavros had asked. 
Yes, he had said. Hold any grudge 
against the regul? Stavros asked. 
No, he had answered simply, which 
was again the truth: He did not like 
them, but it was not a grudge, it 
was war; it was all he knew. And 
Stavros had read his record a sec- 
ond time in his presence and ac- 
cepted him. 

It had sounded good at the time, 
fantastically desirable. From a war 
where life expectancy was rated in 
missions flown, and where he was 
reaching his statistical limit, to an 
easy berth on a diplomatic flight 
under escort, with guaranteed re- 
tirement home and discharge in five 
years; discharge at less than thirty 
on a pension larger than any SurTac 
could reasonably dream of or — and 
this was the thing that Duncan pon- 
dered with the most interest — 
permanent attachment to a new co- 
lonial directorate, permanent assign- 
ment to Stavros’ territories, wealth 
and prominence on a developing 
world. .it was a prize for which men 
would kill or die. He had only to 
endure regul company for a while 
in either case and to win Stavros’ 
approval by his service. He had 
five years to accomplish the latter. 
He meant to do it. 

He had not been much frightened 



when he stepped aboard the regul 
ship. He had read all the data 
known on the regul and knew them 
as non-combative, non-violent by 
preference; a basically timid 
species. The warrior mri had done 
their fighting for them and had pro- 
voked further conflicts, and finally 
the regul had called the mri into re- 
treat, put them under firm control. 
New regul were in power on their 
homeworld now, a pacifist party 
that also controlled the ship on 
which they were traveling and the 
world to which they were bound. 

But he had learned a different 
kind of fear over the long, slow 
voyage; a sullen, biding sort of fear; 
he began to suspect why they had 
wanted a SurTac as Stavros’ com- 
panion: he was trained for alien en- 
vironment, inured to solitude and 
uncertainties and, above all, he was 
ignorant of higher policies. If some- 
thing went wrong — and he began to 
appreciate ways in which it 
could — Stavros would be the only 
considerable expenditure, but Sten 
Duncan was nothing: military per- 
sonnel, with no kin to notify, a loss 
that could be written off without 
worry. His low classification 
number signified that he could spill 
everything he knew to an enemy 
without damage to any essential in- 
stallations; and Stavros himself had 
been long secluded in the university 
community of New Kiluwa. 

Perhaps — the thought occurred to 
him — Stavros himself was capable 
of expending him promptly should 
he prove .inconvenient. Stavros was 
a diplomat of that breed that Dun- 
can instinctively mistrusted, a breed 
that disposed of the likes of Sten 
Duncan by the hundreds and 



FADED SUN 



29 




thousands in war. Perhaps it was 
that which had stolen away Stavros’ 
inclination to talk to him as if he 
were anything more than the fur- 
nishings. Regul dealt with rebellious 
younglings, even with inconvenient 
younglings, instantly and without 
mercy, as if they were an easily re- 
placeable commodity. 

It was a nightbom fear, the kind 
that grew in the dark, in those too- 
long hours when he lay on his bed 
and considered that beyond the one 
door was an alien guard whose very 
life processes he did not understand; 
and beyond the other was a human 
whose mind he did not understand, 
an old man who was learning to 
think like the regul, whose elders 
were a terror to the young. 

But when they were in day-cycle 
together, when he considered Stav- 
ros face to face, he could not be- 
lieve seriously such things as he 
thought and imagined at night. So 
long pent up, so long under such 
stress, it was no strange thing that 
his mind should tum to nameless 
and irrational apprehensions. 

He only wished be knew what 
Stavros hoped he was doing, or 
what Stavros expected him to do. 

* * ★ 

The tape loop cycled its third 
time through. Duncan knew its salu- 
tation, at least — the few words in 
the regul language he knew. Stavros 
was listening and memorizing. 
Shortly he would be able to recite 
the whole thing from memory. 

“Sir,” he interrupted Stavros’ 
thoughts cautiously, “sir, our — ” 
the tape went off, “ — our allotted 
liberty is just about up if you want 



anything else from the library or the 
dispensary.” 

He wished Stavros would think of 
something he needed. He longed to 
enjoy that precious time outside 
their quarters, to walk, to move; but 
Stavros had forbidden him to loiter 
anywhere in regul view or to at- 
tempt any exchange with the crew. 
Duncan understood the reasoning 
behind that prohibition, a sensible 
precaution, a preservation of human 
mystique as far as regul were con- 
cerned: Let them wonder what we 
think, Stavros would say to many a 
situation. But it was unbearable to 
sit here while the liberty ran out and 
with the ship newly arrived in regul 
space. 

“No,” said Stavros, dashing his 
hopes. Then, perhaps an af- 
terthought, he handed him one of 
the tapes. “Here. An excuse. Look 
like you have important business 
and stay to it. Find me the next in 
sequence and bring both back. 
Enjoy your walk.” 

“Yes, sir.” Duncan rose, moved 
to thank the old man, to appreciate 
his understanding of his misery, but 
Stavros started the tape again, 
looked elsewhere, making it awk- 
ward. He hesitated, then left, going 
through his own room to the out- 
side. 

He drew a few deep breaths to 
accustom himself to the taint of the 
air, felt less confined at once even 
faced with the narrow halls. Regul 
living spaces were small, barren 
places, accommodating room only 
for a sled’s operation; most things 
were grouped within reach of some- 
one sitting. He suppressed the de- 
sire to stretch, settled himself to a 
sedate walk and headed for main-

room through a corridor that was ut- 
terly empty of regul. 

Mainroom served all personnel 
for recreation and study; it was the 
library terminal also. Simpler, Dun- 
can thought, to have included a li- 
brary linkup to the console already 
in regul quarters and obviate the 
need for their coming out at all, but 
he was desperately glad that they 
had not. It provided an excuse, as 
Stavros had said. And perhaps there 
were restrictions on some pas- 
sengers, some who could read and 
understand more than they. He did 
not know. He studied the twisting 
regul numbers on the cartridge he 
carried and carefully punched the keys 
next in sequence. 

Machinery clicked, paused with 
the least delay, and the desired car- 
tridge shot into position. He pro- 
vided the library their special code, 
which changed the alphabet module 
artd, notified that humans desired 
the cartridge in question, the library 
flurried through authorizations; it 
went through another process to de- 
cide what printout was supposed to 
accompany the cartridge. Actually 
three forms of printout — literal, 
transliterated and translated — came 
with each, and finally from its mi- 
crostorage it began to produce the 
printouts. 

Duncan paced the room while the 
machine processed the print sheet 
by sheet, then checked the time: 
close. He walked back to the 
machine and it was still working, 
slower than any human-made pro- 
cessing system he had ever used. It 
had reactions like the regul them- 
selves, sluggish. 

To fill the seconds, he counted 
the changes in the viewscreen mock- 



up that was the center of the li- 
brary wall. It showed their course 
through human space, curiously 
never once acknowledging the pres- 
ence of the armed escort vessels 
that had been the source of so much 
controversy. It was out of date as of 
this morning. At every pulse it cy- 
cled through to other views, to 
landscapes fascinating in their alien 
character (carefully censored, he 
was sure, lest they leam too much 
of regul; there were no living things 
and no cities or structures in the 
views) to starfields and back to the 
progress mockup. It dominated the 
room. He had watched it change 
day by slow day during their ap- 
proach to jump. He had ceased to 
think of the voyage as one with a 
particular destination. Their peculiar 
isolation had become an environ- 
ment in itself, one that could not be 
mentally connected to the life he 
had lived before and from which it 
was impossible to imagine the life 
he would live afterward. They had 
only the regul’ s word for where 
they were going. 

He watched through three such 
cyclings and turned back to the 
machine. It had stopped in the mid- 
dle of its printing, flashing the 
Priority signal. Someone of author- 
ity had interrupted it to obtain 
something more important. His 
materials were frozen in the 
machine’s grip. He pushed the can- 
cel button to retrieve the cartridge 
and nothing happened. The Priority 
was still flashing as the library did 
what it was commanded to do from 
some other source. 

Duncan swore and looked again 
at the time. The printout was half in 
the tray, the tail of it still in the 



FADED SUN

machine. He could leave and keep 
scrupulously to the schedule or he 
could wait the little time it would 
take for the machine to clear. He 
decided to wait. Probably the stall 
was because of the printout, an un- 
wieldy and awkward operation, 
surely a rare function of their li- 
brary apparatus, inefficiently done. 
The rumor used to be that regul 
themselves did not write at all; this 
was not, as they had discovered, 
true. Regul had an elaborate and in- 
tricate written language. But the li- 
brary was designed for audio repli- 
cation. The majority of regul mate- 
rials were oral-aural. It was said, 
and this seemed true according to 
their own observations, that the 
regul did not need to hear any tape 
more than once. 

Instant and total recall. Eidetic 
memory. The word lie was, he re- 
membered Stavros telling him, 
fraught with associate concepts of 
perversion and murder. 

A species that could neither 
forget nor unlearn. 

If this were so, it was possible 
that they could depend on the exact 
truth from the regul at all times. 

It was also possible that a species 
that could not lie might have 
learned other ways of deception. 

He did not need to wonder how 
regul regarded humans, who placed 
great emphasis on the written word, 
who had to be provided special and 
separate materials to comprehend 
slowly what regul absorbed at a 
single hearing; who could not leam 
the regul language, while regul 
learned human speech as rapidly as 
they could be provided words, and 
never needed to be told twice. 

When he thought of this and of 



the regul younglings, so helplessly 
slow, so ponderous in their move- 
ments, and yet the piggish little 
eyes glittering with some emotion 
that wrinkled the comers when they 
beheld a human, he grew uneasy, 
remembering that these same 
younglings, unless murdered by 
their own parent, would live 
through several human lifetimes and 
remember every instant of it; and 
that bai Hulagh, who commanded 
them and the ship and the zone 
where they were bound, had done 
so. 

He resented both their long lives 
and their exact memories. He re- 
sented the obstinacy of their 
ubiquitous machines, the bigotry 
and insolence that kept Stavros and 
himself confined and tightly 
scheduled as they were, surrounded 
by automation that made their regul 
hosts more than the physical equals 
of humans; and with all the ac- 
cumulating frustration of. long im- 
prisonment, he resented most of all 
the petty irritations that were con- 
stantly placed in their way by their 
regul hosts, who clearly despised 
humans for their mental shortcom- 
ings. 

Stavros was headed for failure if 
he sought accomodation with such 
neighbors. It was a mortal mistake 
to think that a human could become 
regul or that he won anything at all 
by slavishly imitating the manners 
of beings that despised him. 

That was the worm that had eaten 
at his gut ever since the first days 
of this chromium-plated, silken-soft 
imprisonment. All about them were 
regul and regul machines, hulking 
beasts helpless but for that automa- 
tion, great shapeless parasites living 



34 



GALAXY 




attached to appliances of steel and 
chromium; and Stavros was utterly, 
dangerously, wrong if he thought he 
became esteemed of regul by giving 
up the few advantages that humans 
had. The regul looked with con- 
tempt on them, on the species 
whose minds forgot, whose knowl- 
edge was on film and paper. 

Duncan sought to say this to 
Stavros but he could not come close 
enough to the man to advise him. 
Stavros was an educated man, he 
was not — he was only an experi- 
enced one, and experience cried out 
that they were in a dangerous situa- 
tion. 

He struck the library panel a 
blow with his hand for the time was 
out and he was defeated by the 
monstrosity — incredible that the 

thing could be so slow. It was as 
futile and thoughtless as jostling any 
human-made machine; but he knew 
in the second afterward that he 
should not have done it and when 
the Priority signal went off, he was 
for an instant terrified, believing 
that he had caused this somehow, 
antagonizing some high-ranking re- 
gul. 

But the machine started to feed 
out the rest of the paper and then 
shot the cartridge out in good order, 
and he paused to gather them up. 
And when, in turning to leave, he 
looked up at the panel, he saw that 
the whole display had changed and 
that they had before them the visual 
of a star system with seven planets, 
with their ship plotted in toward the 
second. 

Their final desination! 

As he watched, he saw another 
ship indicated on the simulation; it 
was moving outward on a non- 



intersecting course. They were in- 
system — in inhabited, trafficked re- 
gions, nearing Kesrith. Time began 
to move again. His heart quickened 
with the elating surety that they had 
indeed arrived where they were 
supposed to, that they were near 
their new world. Coming in to dock 
at Kesrith’s station would be a pro- 
cess of more than a week, by that 
diagram, but they were coming in. 

The imprisonment was almost 
over. 

A step sounded in the corridor to 
his left. For an instant he ignored it, 
knowing that he was overtime and 
expecting a surly rebuke from a 
youngling; and the ominous charac- 
ter of it did not at first register. 
Then it struck him that it did not 
belong here — the measured tread of 
boots on the flooring, not the slow 
scuffing of the regul nor even 
Stavros’ fragile tread. He turned, 
frightened even before he looked 
by a presence that was not of them- 
selves nor of the regul. 

And he faced a figure that had 
likewise stopped still, one robed in 
black, the robes glittering with 
many small discs. Mri. Kel’en. The 
golden eyes above the veil were as- 
tonished. A slim bronze hand went 
to the knife at his belt and hesitated 
there. 

For a moment neither moved and 
it was possible to hear only the 
slow changes of the projector. 

The enemy. The destroyers of 
Kiluwa and Talos and Asgard. He 
had never seen one in the flesh at 
this range. Only the eyes, the hands, 
were uncovered. The tall figure re- 
mained utterly still, wrapped in 
menace and in anger. 

“I am Sten Duncan,” he found 



FADED SUN

courage to say, doubting that the 
mri could understand a word but 
reckoning it time words intervened 
before weapons did. “I’m the assist- 
ant to the Federation’s envoy.” 

“I am kel Medai,” said the other 
in excellent Basic, “and we should 
not have met.” 

And with that the mri turned on 
his heel and stalked off in the direc- 
tion from which he had come, a 
black figure that vanished into 
shadows at the turning of the cor- 
ridor. Duncan found himself trem- 
bling in every muscle. He had seen 
mri that close only in photographs, 
and all of those were dead. 

Beautiful, was the strange de- 
scriptive that came to his mind, see- 
ing the mri warrior: He would have 
thought it fo an animal, splendid of 
its kind, and deadly. 

He turned, and his blood, which 
had resumed somewhat its normal 
circulation, drained a second time; 
for a regul youngling stood in the 
mainroom, its nostrils flaring and 
shutting in rapid agitation. 

It shrilled a warning at him, 
anger, terror; he could not tell 
which. Its color went to livid pallor. 
“Go to quarters,” it insisted. “Past 
time. Go to quarters. Now!” 

He moved, edged past the regul 
and hurried on, not looking back. 
When he reached the sanctuary of 
his own doorway, his hands were 
shaking and he thrust himself 
through even while it was opening 
and shut it at once, anxious until 
the seal had hissed into function. 
Then he sank down on his cot, 
knowing that, all too quickly, he 
must face Stavros and give an ac- 
count of what he had done. The li- 
brary materials tumbled from his 



cold hands and some of the papers 
fell on the floor. He bent and 
gathered them up, feeling nothing 
with his benumbed fingers. 

He had committed a great mis- 
take, and he knew that this was not 
to be the end of it. 

They were going to the world 
that was said to be the mri 
homeworld, to Kesrith of the star 
Arain. 

Regul claimed title to it, all the 
same, and the right to cede it to 
humans. They claimed the authority 
to command the mri and to sign for 
them. 

They had betrayed the mri and 
yet they carried a kel’en on the ship 
that brought the orders that turned 
Kesrith over to humans. 

We should not have met, the mri 
had said. 

It was obvious that the regul at 
least, and possibly the mri, had not 
intended the meeting. Someone was 
being deceived. 

He gathered himself up and ex- 
pelled a long breath, rapped on 
Stavros’ door and entered this time 
without permission. 

IV 

Another one of the ships was 
leaving this evening, one of the 
several shuttles that ferried 
passengers and goods from the sur- 
face of Kesrith up to the station and 
thence to starships: to freighters, 
liners, warships — anything that 

would remove panicked regul from 
the path of humans. 

Niun watched, as he was accus- 
tomed to watch each evening, from 
the high rock that overlooked the 
sea and the fiats and the city. It was 



36 



GALAXY 




true. He had accepted the fact of 
the war’s end at last, although a 
sense of unreality still possessed 
him as he watched the ships go — 
never so frequent, not in his 
lifetime nor, he thought, in that of 
his elders. The fact was that the 
regul city was dying, its life ebbing 
with every outbound ship. 

He obeyed the she’pan’s order 
and did not go near the city or the 
port, but he thought that were he to 
go down now into the square, he 
would find many of the buildings 
empty and stripped of things of 
value; and day after day, by the 
road that wound along the seashore, 
the merest line visible from his van- 
tage point, he could see traffic com- 
ing into the city, bringing regul 
from the outlying towns and sta- 
tions; aircraft came to the city, and 
fewer and fewer left it again. He 
had a mental image of a vast heap 
of abandoned regul vehicles at the 
edge of town, of ships idle at the 
port. They would have to drag them 
into heaps and let them rust. 

It was rumored — so Sathell had 
gleaned from regul communi- 
cations — that the chief price of the 
peace the regul had bought had been 
the cession of every colony in 
the Kesrith reach. 

Tsi’mri economics had finally 
proven more powerful than the 
weapons of the Kel, more impor- 
tant, surely, than the honor of the 
mri in the regul’s estimation. Kes- 
rith was a loss to the regul, to be 
sure; it was a mining and transport 
site, expensively automated. Doubt- 
less to lose such a colony was em- 
barrassing to the regul elders; doubt- 
less it was inconvenient for their 
business and commerce; doubtless 



for the regul in those fleeing ships 
the inconvenience ascended to 
tragedy. 

Regul valued many peculiar ob- 
jects; variance in the quality and 
amount of these and their clothing 
and their comforts betokened per- 
sonal worth in their eyes; and the 
loss of their homes and valued ob- 
jects that could not be taken onto 
the ships would be grievous for 
them; but they had no Revered Ob- 
jects, nothing that could afflict them 
to the degree that the loss of 
homeworld could affect the People; 
and the honors they coveted could 
be purchased anew if they were 
fortunate — unlike mri honors, that 
had to be won. 

And therein Niun did not muster 
any great sympathy for them. His 
personal loss was great enough: All 
the life he had planned and desired 
for himself was departing possibility 
with the violence and speed of those 
outbound ships. The migration had 
become a rout, night and day; and 
events gave clear proof that the per- 
sonal plans of Niun s’Intel Zain- 
Abrin were nothing to the powers 
that moved the worlds. But the 
threat to the House — that was be- 
yond his power to imagine. And 
that the powers that moved the 
worlds had no concern for the fate 
of the People — that was beyond all 
understanding. 

He had tried to adjust his mind to 
this change in fortune. 

Where shall we make our de- 
fense? he had asked of Eddan and 
the kel’ein, assuming, as he as- 
sumed that sanity rested with his 
People, that there was to be a de- 
fense of homeworld, of the Edun of 
the People. 



FADED SUN 



37 




But Eddan had turned his face 
from the question, gesturing his re- 
fusal to answer it; and in the failure 
of the Kel, he had dared ask the 
she’pan herself. And Intel had 
looked at him with a strange sor- 
row, as if her last son were some- 
how lacking in essential understand- 
ing; but gently she had spoken to 
him in generalities of patience and 
courage, and carefully she had de- 
clined to give any direct answer to 
his question. 

And day by day the regul ships 
departed, without mri kel’ein 
aboard. The she’pan forbade. 

He was watching the end. He un- 
derstood that now, that at least. Of 
what it was an end to he was not 
yet sure; but he knew the taste of 
finality, and that of the things he 
had desired all his life, there was 
left him nothing. The regul de- 
parted, and hereafter came humans. 

He wished now desperately that 
he had applied himself with even 
more zeal to his study of human 
ways so that he could understand 
what the humans were likely to do. 
Perhaps the elder kel’ein, who had 
experience with them, knew; and 
perhaps therefore they thought that 
he should know and would not re- 
ward ignorance with explanation. 
Or perhaps they were as helpless as 
he and refused to admit the obvious 
to him. He could not blame them 
for that. It was that he simply could 
not admit that there was nothing to 
be done, that there were no prepara- 
tions to be made, while the regul so 
desperately, so anxiously, sought 
safety'. He knew, with what faith 
remained to him in his diminishing 
store of things untrustworthy, that 
the Kel would resist in the end; but 



they were to die if that were the 
case. Their skill was great, greater 
than any kel’ein living, he believed; 
but the nine were very old and very 
few to stand for long against the 
mass attacks of humans. 

The imagination came to him 
over and over again — as horrid and 
unreal as the departure of regul 
from his life — of humans arriving, 
of human language and human tread 
echoing in the sanctity of the edun 
Shrine, of fire and blood and ten 
desperate kel’ein trying to defend 
the she’pan from a horde of defiling 
humans. 

Brothers, sister, he longed to ask 
the kel’ein, is it possible that there 
is some hope that I cannot see? 
And then again he thought: Or, o 
Gods, is it possible that we have a 
she’pan who has gone mad? 
Brothers, sister, look, look, the 
ships! . our way off Kesrith. 
Make our she’pan see reason. She 
has forgotten that there are some 
here that want to live. 

But he could not say such things 
to his elders, to Eddan; and he 
would ultimately have to account 
for those words to Intel’s face and 
he could not bear that. He could not 
reason with them, could not discuss 
anything with them as they did 
among themselves, in secret; they, 
she — all save Melein and himself — 
remembered Nisren’s days, the life 
before the war. They had taken 
regul help once, escaping the ruin 
of Nisren, and they refused it now, 
resolving together in councils from 
which he, not of the Husbands, was 
excluded. He insisted to believe that 
his elders were rational. They were 
too calm, too sure, to be mad. 

Forty-three years ago the like had 



38 



GALAXY 




come to Nisren. A regul ship, res- 
cuing she’pan Intel, had carried the 
Holy Pana and the survivors of the 
edun to Kesrith. The elders did not 
speak of that day, scarcely even in 
songs: It was a pain written into 
their visible scars and the secrecies 
of their silence. 

Shame? he wondered, heart-tom 
at thinking ill of them. Shame at 
something they did or did not do on 
Nisren? Shame at living and unwill- 
ingness to survive another fall of 
homeworld? Sometimes he sus- 
pected, with dread growing and 
gnawing within him like some alien 
parasite, that such was the case and 
that he belonged to a she’pan who 
had wearied of running, to an edun 
that had consciously made up its 
mind to die. 

An edun which held the Pana, the 
Revered, the Objects of mri honor 
and mri history, to behold which 
was for the Sen alone, to touch 
which unbidden was to die; to lose 
this. 

To lose the relics of the 
People. 

It betokened the death not alone 
of the edun but of the People as a 
race. He held the thought a mo- 
ment, turned it within his mind, 
then cast it aside in haste, and fear- 
fully picked it up again. 

O Gods, he thought, mind 
numbed by the very concept. 
Another shuttle lifted. He saw it 
rise, up, up, a star that moved. 

O Gods, o Gods. 

It was shon’ai, the passing-game. 
It was the flash of blades in the 
dark, the deadly game of rhythm 
and bluff and threat and reckless 
risk. 

The game of the People. 



The blades were thrown. Ex- 
istence was gambled on one’s 
quickness and wit and nerve, for no 
other reason than to deserve survi- 
val. 

He felt the blood drain from his 
face to his belly, understanding why 
they had looked through him when 
he had asked his vain questions. 

Join the rhythm, child of the 
People: Be one with it; accept, ac- 
cept, accept. 

Shon’ai! 

He cried aloud, and understood 
all at once. All over known space 
mri would react to the throw the 
she’pan of Kesrith had made. They 
would come, they would come, 
from all quarters of space, to fight, 
to resist. 

The Pana was set in the keeping 
of Edun Kesrithun. 

The circle was wide and the 
blades flew at seeming random but 
each game tended to develop its 
own unique pattern, and wisest the 
player that did not become hyp- 
notized by it. 

Intel had cast. It was for others to 
return the throw. 

The first of Kesrith ’s twin moons 
had brightened to the point of visi- 
bility. The stars became a dusty belt 
across the sky. The air grew chill 
but he felt no impulse to return to 
the edun, to resume the mundane 
routine of their existence. Not this 
evening. Not upon such thoughts as 
he carried. Eventually the kel’ein 
would miss him and look out and 
see him in his favorite place, and 
let him be. He spent many evenings 
here. There was nothing to do in 
the edun of evenings save to sleep, 
to eat, to study tilings no longer 
true. None of them had sung the 



FADED SUN 



39 




songs since the day the news of the 
war’s end came. TTiey frequently sat 
and talked together, excluding him. 
Probably, he thought, it was a relief 
to them to have him gone. 

The geyser named Sochau 
belched steam far across the 
flats — a tall plume, predictible as 
the hours of any regul clock. By 
such rhythms the world lived, and 
by such rhythms it measured the 
days until the humans should come. 

But for the first time in all the 
days since he had heard of the 
war’s ending, he felt a suspicion of 
gladness, a fierce sense that the 
People might yet have something to 
do, and that humans might yet find 
their victory not an accomplished 
fact. 

A star grew in the sky as the 
other departed, rapid and omen- 
filled. He looked up at it with 
quickening interest, enlivened by 
anything, even a triviality, that was 
not part of the ordinary. The shut- 
tles did not usually descend until 
morning. He watched it grow, 
cherishing imaginings both dread 
and hopeful — a mere child’s game 
for he did not really believe that it 
would be anything but a variance in 
regul schedules for regul reasons, as 
ordinary as anything could be in the 
organized routine of Kesrith’s dy- 
ing. 

He watched it descend and saw 
lights suddenly flare- on at the port 
in the farthest area. Then he re- 
alized that it was not coming down 
at the freighter or shuttle berths but 
to that area given over to military 
landings, and it was no shuttle. It 
was a ship of size, such as the on- 
world port had not held in many 
years. 



The ship was nothing in the dark 
and the distance but a shape of 
light, featureless, nameless. There 
was nothing to indicate what it was. 
Of a sudden he knew his people 
must have word of this — that doubt- 
less they had already been alert to it 
and only he had not. 

He sprang down from his rock 
and began to run, swift feet chang- 
ing course here and there at the out- 
set where the fragile earth masked 
dangers of its own. He did not use 
the road but ran crosslands, by an 
old mri trail, and came breathless to 
the door of the edun, chest aching. 

There was silence in the halls. He 
paused for only a moment, then 
took the stairs toward the she’pan’s 
tower, almost running up the first 
turn. 

And there a shadow met him — 
old Dahacha coming down, 
Dahacha with his great, surly dus 
lumbering downsteps after him. Ev- 
eryone brought up short and the dus 
edged down a step to rumble a 
warning. 

“Niun,” the old man said, “I 
was coming to look for you. ’ ’ 

“There is a ship,” Niun be^an. 

“No news here,” said Dahacha. 
“ Hazan is back. Yai! Gome on up, 
young one. You are missed.” 

Niun followed, a great joy in 
him: Hazan, command ship for the 
zone! High time it came — among 
regul panicked and retreating in dis- 
order. There was resolution in the 
regul after all, some authority to 
hold the disintegrating situation 
under control. 

And Hazan! If Hazan came, then 
came Medai — cousin, fellow kel’en 
— home from human wars and bring- 
ing with him experience and all the

common sense that belonged to the 
fighting Kel of the front. 

He remembered other things of 
Medai too, things less beloved; but 
they made no difference after six 
years, with the world falling into 
chaos. He followed Dahacha up the 
winding stairs with an absolute ela- 
tion flooding through him. 

Another kel’en. 

A man the others would listen to 
as they would never listen to him, 
who had never left the world. 

Medai, who had served with the 
leaders of regul and knew their 
minds as few kel’ein had had the 
opportunity to know them. Medai, 
kel’en to the ship of the bai of Kes- 
rith zones.

The door was locked, as it was at 
every unpermitted period. Sten 
Duncan tried it yet another time, 
knowing it was useless, pounded his 
fist against it and went back to the 
old man. 

“They refused to answer,” said 
Stavros. He sat in the desk-chair, 
the console screen at his left elbow 
a monotone gray. He looked un- 
easy, unusual for Stavros, even at 
the worst of times. 

They were down, onworld. That 
was unmistakable. 

“We were to dock,” said Dun- 
can finally, voicing the merest part 
of the concern boiling in his mind. 

Stavros did not react to that piece 
of observation; only stared at him 
dispassionately. Duncan read blame 
into the look. 

“If there has been a change in 
plans, something could be wrong 
either on the station or onworld,” 



Duncan said, trying to draw the 
smallest reassurance from the old 
man, seeking a denial of his ap- 
prehensions, even outright anger. 
He could deal with that. 

And when Stavros gave him noth- 
ing at all in reply, he sank down 
at the table, head bowed against his 
hands, exhausted with the strain of 
waiting. It was their night, and they 
were halfway through it. 

“Perhaps they’re sleeping,” 
Stavros said unexpectedly, startling 
him with a tone that held nothing of 
rancor. “If they chose to keep 
ship-cycle after landing, or if we’re 
in local night, bai Hulagh could be 
asleep and his orderlies unwilling to 
respond to us without his authority. 
The regul do not inconvenience an 
elder of his rank. ’ ’ 

Duncan looked up at him, not be- 
lieving the explanation but glad that 
Stavros had made the gesture, even 
if he had another in the back of his 
mind that he was not saying. It did 
not ease his feelings in the least that 
Stavros had never said anything to 
him in the matter of the encounter 
with the mri, but had only asked 
quiet questions of what had hap- 
pened there in the mainroom: no 
blame, no hint of what had passed 
in Stavros’ mind. Nor had Stavros 
said anything when they were 
shortly afterward presented with 
another schedule; their hours of lib- 
erty cut in half, a regul youngling 
constantly watching their door and 
following at a distance whenever 
Duncan left the room. 

The retaliation fell most heavily 
on himself, of course, confining 
him more closely, while that did not 
much concern Stavros; but for their 
safety and for the future of regul/ 



FADED SUN 



41 




human cooperation, it augured ill 
enough. The regul’s official manner 
did not change toward them. There 
was still the formal manner, still the 
salutations in the day’s messages. 
Characteristic of the regul, there 
had been no direct mention of the 
incident in the hall, only the notifi- 
cation, without explanation, that 
their hours had been changed. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” Duncan volun- 
teered at last out of frustration. 

Stavros looked for once sur- 
prised, then frowned and shrugged. 
“Probably just regul procedure and 
some minor change in plans. Don’t 
worry about it.” And then, with a 
second shrug, “Get some sleep, 
Duncan. There’s little else to do at 
the moment.” 

“Yes, sir,” he said, rose and 
went out to the anteroom, sat down 
on his bunk and tucked his legs up. 
He set his elbows on his knees and 
head on his hands and massaged his 
aching temples. 

Prisoners, thanks to him. 

Stavros was worried. Stavros 
doubtless knew what there was to 
concern them, and he was worried. 
Perhaps if the regul would have ac- 
cepted the offering, Stavros could 
have demonstrated the punishment 
of the human youngling who had 
created the difficulty. Perhaps, in 
the main, he had not done so be- 
cause they were both human and 
Stavros felt an unvoiced attachment 
to him; or perhaps he had declined 
to do so because a regul elder 
would not have done so under the 
same circumstances. 

But it was clear enough that they 
were under the heavy shadow of 
regul displeasure and had been for 
many, many days; and that they 



were not now where they had been 
told at the outset they would land. 

★ ★ ★ 

A sound reached him, the sound 
of someone passing in the corridor: 
one of the sleds whisking along the 
tracks outside. He looked up as it 
seemed to slow, hoping against 
hope that it would stop to bring 
them news. 

The door opened. He spraing to 
his feet, instantly correct. The sled 
had indeed stopped before the 
doorway and within it sat the old- 
est, most massive regul that he had 
ever seen. Roll upon roll of wrin- 
kled flesh and crusting skin hid any 
hint of structure that lay within that 
gray-brown body save the bony 
plating of the face, where eyes were 
sunk in circular wrinkles, black and 
glittering eyes; and flat nose and slit 
mouth gave a deceptive illusion of 
humanity. 

It was the face of a man within 
the body of a beast, and that body 
was lapped in brown robes, silver- 
edged and shimmering, gossamer 
enfolding a gross and wrinkle- 
crossed skin. The nostrils were 
slanted slits that could flare and 
close. He knew this movement for 
an indication of emotion in the 
younglings, one of the few expres- 
sions of which their bone-shielded 
faces were capable — a roll of the 
eyes, an opening or closing of the 
lips, a flutter of the nostrils. But 
had he not known that this being 
was of precisely the same species as 
the younglings, he would have 
doubted ft. 

Incredibly the elder arose, heav- 
ing his body upright, and stood on 



42 



GALAXY 




bowed and almost invisible legs 
within the sled. 

“Stavros,” it — he — said in abasso 
rumble. 

Humans could not imitate regul 
expression: the regul perhaps could 
not read courtesy or lack of it 
among humans, but Duncan knew 
that courtesy was called for now. 
He made a bow. 

“Favor,” he said in the. regul 
tongue, “I am the youngling Sten 
Duncan.” 

“Call Stavros.” 

But the door was open. Duncan 
turned, about to comply with the 
order, and saw of a sudden Stavros 
in the doorway, standing three, com- 
ing no further. 

There was a rumbling exchange 
of regul politenesses, and Duncan 
took himself to the side of the room 
against the wall, bewildered in the 
flow of language. He realized what 
he had suspected already, that this 
was the bai himself who had come 



to call on them. Bai Hulagh 
Alagn-ni, high commander of the 
ship Hazan, successor to the Holn 
and provisional governor of Kes- 
rith’s zones during the transfer of 
powers from regul to human. 

He made himself unnoticed; he 
would not offend a second time 
against regul manners, complicating 
things that he could not understand. 

The exchange was brief. It was 
concluded with a series of cour- 
tesies and gestures, and the bai sub- 
sided into his sled and vanished. 
Stavros closed the door for himself, 
before Duncan could free himself of 
his confusion and do so. 

“Sir?” Duncan ventured then. 

Stavros took his time in answer- 
ing. He looked around finally, with 
a sober and uneasy expression. 

“We are grounded on Kesrith,” 
he said. “The bai assures us it is 
quite a natural choice for a ship of 
this sort — to land directly at the 
port — and that it was a last-moment 





decision and without reason for 
concern to us. But I also gather that 
there is some instability here, which 
I do not understand. The bai wants 
us to remain on the ship. Temporar- 
ily, he says.” 

“Is it,” Duncan asked, “trouble 
over that business with the mri?” 

Stavros shook his head. “I don’t 
know. I don’t know. I think that the 
whole crew is expected to remain 
aboard until things sort themselves 
out. This, at least . ” Stavros’ 
eyes went to the ceiling, toward 
venting, toward lighting, toward in- 
stallations they did not understand 
and did not trust. The glance 
warned, said nothing, carried some 
misgiving that perhaps he would 
have voiced if he were safe to do 
so. “The bai assures us that we will 
be taken to the central headquarters 
in the morning. It is planetary night 
at the moment; we are already on 
Kesrith main time, and he advises 
us that the weather is fair and the 
inconvenience minor, and we are 
expected to enjoy our night’s rest 
and rise late, with the anticipation 
of a pleasant advent to Kesrith.” 

The bai is being courteous and 
formal. Stavros’ expression thrust 
through the words themselves, but 
there was no credibility on his face. 
Duncan nodded understanding. 

“Good night, then,” said Stav- 
ros, as though the exchange had 
been aloud. “I think we may trust 
that we are delayed aboard for some 
considerable number of hours, and 
there is probably time to get a 
night’s sleep.” 

“Good night, sir,” said Duncan, 
and watched as the old man went 
back to his quarters and the door 
closed. 



He wished, not for the first time, 
that he could ask the old man 
plainly what he thought of matters, 
and that he could reckon how much 
the Honorable Stavros believed of 
what he had been told. 

In the time that they had been on 
scant favor among regul, Duncan 
had begun to apply himself to learn- 
ing the regul tongue with the same 
fervent, desperate application he 
had one applied to SurTac arms and 
survival skills. He had begun with 
rote phrases and proceeded to struc- 
ture with a facility far above that he 
had ever imagined he could 
achieve. He was not a scholar; he 
was a frightened man. He began to 
think — with the nightmare concen- 
tration that fears acquired in their 
solitude — that Stavros was indeed 
very old, and the time before hu- 
mans would arrive was considera- 
ble, and that regul, who disposed of 
their own younglings so readily, 
would think nothing of killing a 
human youngling that had survived 
his elder, if that human youngling 
seemed useless to them. 

Stavros’ age, which had been the 
reason for his being assigned this 
mission, was also against its suc- 
cess. If something should befall the 
Honorable Mr. Stavros, it would 
leave Duncan himself helpless, un- 
able to communicate with the gen- 
eral run of younglings and, as Stav- 
ros had once pointed out, regul 
younglings would not admit him to 
contact with the likes of bai 
Hulagh, who were the only regul 
capable of fluent human speech. 

It was not a possibility he cared 
to contemplate, the day that he 
should be left alone to deal with re- 
gul.

GALAXY 




With hours left before debarka- 
tion on Kesrith, and with his nerves 
too taut to allow sleep, he gathered 
up his notes and started to study 
with an application that had his gut 
in knots. 

Dag: favor, please, attention. The 
same syllable, pronounced instead 
with the timbre of a steam whistle, 
meant honorable and, in shrill tone, 
blood. Dag su-gl’ inh-an-ant pru 
nnugk: may I have indirect contact 
with the reverence? Dag nuc-ci: fa- 
vor, sir. 

He studied until he found the 
notes falling from his nerveless 
hands, and then collapsed to sleep 
for a precious time before regul or- 
derlies opened the door without 
warning and began shrilling orders 
at him, rudely snatching up their 
baggage without a prior courtesy. 

None of the courtesies did these 
youngling regul use with him, even 
when he protested their rough hand- 
ling of the human belongings; they 
maintained a surly silence toward 
him, a fevered haste, interspersed 
with a chittering among themselves, 
as they loaded baggage on the 
transport sled that was to carry it 
away. Another vehicle waited, a 
passenger sled. 

“Now. Now!” one said, the 
word being the extent of the human 
vocabulary he had troubled to hear, 
urging haste; and only when Stavros 
himself appeared did the younglings 
assume decorum. 

Even an elder human had his 
honor from the regul: They seemed 
to regard Stavros with a healthy 
fear. 

But Duncan, when he looked 
back as they were boarding, 
chanced to glance directly into the 



face of one of the younglings that 
bent, assisting them into the sled, 
and nostrils snapped shut and lips 
clamped with a look of hatred that 
transcended species. 

They were on Kesrith, among re- 
gul, who would be their com- 
panions and counselors in dealing 
with the evacuation of other regul, 
who had made their homes here for 
centuries. They had come to take 
this world as conquerors, con- 
querors who, at least for thirty 
days, were only two, and vulnera- 
ble. The world had belonged to 
regul and to mri; and it was likely 
that certain of the crew of Hazan 
had called Kesrith their home. 

It dawned upon him with im- 
mediacy that there could be more 
than simple racial or political hatred 
among regul toward their presence 
on Kesrith. 

And perhaps there were many res- 
idents on Kesrith who had never 
consented to the treaty that disposed 
of their world and brought humans 
to it. 

The inconvenience is minor, Stav- 
ros had translated the bai’s assur- 
ance. Perhaps in the bai’s eyes it 
was minor — the regul were not sup- 
posed to be able to lie — but in the 
eyes of the regul younglings who at- 
tended them there was no lie either, 
and they told a different story. 

While they were on Kesrith, they 
would be housed in a building 
called the Nom, in the center of the 
chief city of Kesrith, and they 
would be thus protected for the first 
and most critical days against the ir- 
ritations of Kesrith’s natural atmos- 
phere and the other minor incon- 
veniences of the local climate; they 
would be expected to adapt.

And he saw Stavros’ face when 
they first broke out of the ship’s 
warmth into the wide world and had 
their first sight of the place: hills, 
mountains, white plains, all 
strangely lit by a ruddy pink sun. 

For Stavros this was home 
forever. His assignment was to pre- 
pare for other humans, to direct 
them after they arrived, to build 
civilization again; and already Dun- 
can was considering that five years 
here might be a long time indeed. 

Regul, and alkali flats, and gey- 
sers, dust and mines and a sun that 
looked sickly and too large in the 
sky. He had been on a half a score 
of words in his travels in the serv- 
ice, from bare balls of rock to 
flowering wildernesses, but he had 
never been on one so immediately 
alien as Kesrith. 

Forbidding, unfriendly to hu- 
mans. The very air smelled poison- 
ous, laden with irritants. 

If Stavros felt regret, he did not 
show it. He let himself be treated 
like a regul elder, already playing 
the part, and the younglings handed 
him down to the landsled that 
waited below. It was well after 
dawn, the sun a quarter of the way 
up the sky. There was, instead of 
the welcome they had expected — 
like most regul courtesies, carefully 
controlled and managed — a still and 
ghostly quiet about the port, as 
though they and the younglings 
were the only living things about 
the premises. 

And far away, on the heights, 
was visible something that set Dun- 
can’s heart to beating the more 
rapidly, that sent a clutch of fear at 
the stomach that had nothing to do 
with reason: the peculiar silhouette 



of four slanted towers that formed a 
flat-topped, irregular pyramid. 

A mri edun. He had known there 
was one onworld; he had seen pic- 
tures of the ruins of Nisren; but he 
was unprepared for it here, so 
close. It overlooked the city in such 
a way that nothing that was done on 
the plains could remain hidden from 
it. 

It brooded, an ominous and alien 
presence, reminding all that there 
was a third party to the transaction 
that promised peace. 

“Now. Now!” the regul re- 
peated, impatient either at the delay 
or at the object of his attention, it 
was uncertain; but Duncan did not 
want to 'contest the matter, and he 
lowered his head and entered the 
sled, where the air was filtered and 
cleansed of the acrid, biting taste 
that contaminated the air of Kesrith. 

The sled lumbered off toward the 
city on pavement made rough by in- 
roads of sand from the flats, taking 
them to what he thought, with in- 
creasing conviction, was a confine- 
ment only wider in space than their 
last. 

VI 

The sun was climbing the east, 
and on another day Niun would 
have been out about the hills, walk- 
ing, hunting, practicing at arms, 
doing all other such things as he did 
to fill the solitary hours and relieve 
the sameness of his days. 

But on this day nothing could 
have persuaded him from the vicin- 
ity of the edun. He haunted the 
communications station in the top of 
the Sen tower where, in an edun 
grown informal by reason of its 



46 



GALAXY 




small size, he was permitted to be 
on occasion; he hovered about the 
main entrance; and finally, con- 
sumed by impatience, he went to 
the rock at the top of the causeway, 
to stare into the growing glare off 
the white flats and strain his eyes 
for any movement from the direc- 
tion of the port. 

He had for so very, very long 
had nothing good to anticipate. 
Now he savored th^ feeling: hating 
the waiting and yet relishing the 
feeling of waiting; hesitant about 
the meeting and yet longing 
desperately for the comradeship it 
promised. He had not loved Medai. 
He remembered the rivalry with his 
cousin, his — he could be honest 
with himself after so many years — 
jealousy of his cousin; and he strove 
to forget any such feelings he had 
ever cherished. He wanted Medai ’s 
presence, wanted it desperately, 
fervently. Anything was better than 
this long loneliness, this knowledge 
that the edun was slowly, 
irrevocably, perishing. 

And there was, at the foundation 
of all his thoughts, the least stirring 
of hope, the merest suspicion, that 
Medai had been summoned, that he 
was the first of many to come — that 
the she ’pan had moved to action, 
and that something was moving in 
the future of the People. 

On a thousand previous days he 
had sat as he sat now, seeking any 
tiny deviation in events to occupy 
himself — the struggles of an insect; 
the slow, perilous blooming of a 
windflower; the rise or descent of 
ships at the port — ill-wishing such 
ships, ■ imagining disasters; imagin- 
ing important arrivals that would 
somehow change the pattern of his 



existence. He had done this so often 
that it was hard to realize that this 
time it was real, that the game was 
substance on this morning so like a 
thousand other mornings. The very 
air seemed alive. His heart beat so 
strongly, his muscles were so taut 
that his chest and stomach hurt; and 
he almost forgot to breathe 
whenever his eyes would deceive 
him into believing that he had seen 
movement below. 

But in the full light of noon there 
was a plume of dust on the flats, al- 
ready at the beginning of the 
causeway, a line of dark figures 
moving slowly upward. He sat upon 
his rock at the top of the causeway 
and lowered his visor to remove the 
haze of daylight, trying to discern 
the figures individually. 

He had seen vehicles come up the 
road years before. Judging from the 
distance and the size of the objects 
and the amount of dust, that was 
what it looked to be. Vehicles. A 
sense of wrongness grew in him, a 
weight in his stomach counterpoised 
against the beating of his heart. He 
clenched his limbs together, long 
arms wrapped about his knees, and 
watched, unwilling to run and tell 
the others. Regul. Regul were com- 
ing up. 

Once he would have been de- 
lighted at such an unaccustomed 
visitation, but he was not so on this 
morning of all mornings. Not now. 
Not with mri business afoot that 
was more important than regul. 

Not with mri business in the 
working, matters in which regul 
might seek to interfere. 

Of a sudden he realized that the 
she ’pan desperately needed to know 
what was coming up the hill: He 



FADED SUN 



47 




made them out — six vehicles and a 
moving dot farther back that his 
eyes could not resolve; but it looked 
to be a seventh. 

No such number of regul had 
ever called on the edun in his mem- 
ory. 

He slid down from his rock and 
started downhill, his long strides 
carrying him at what swiftly became 
an uncontrollable run, undignified, 
but he was too alarmed to care for 
appearances. He raced toward the 
edun, breathless. 

Others were coming out the 
doorway even before he arrived 
with his warning — the black-robes 
of the Kel and none of gold. He 
slowed his pace and went to them, 
out of breath and trying to conceal 
his pain. Sweat filmed his skin, 
quickly dried as the moisture- 
hungry air stole it. One did not run 
on Kesrith; a hundred times he had 
been taught so, the sober necessities 
of the world imposed over the na- 
ture of youth. His lungs burned; 
there was the sharp edge of blood in 
the air he breathed. None of the Kel 
rebuked him for his rashness, and 
he felt the mood of them, saw it in 
the attitude of the attendant dusei 
that had come out of the edun with, 
them. One of the dusei reared up, 
towering, snuffing the wind. It 
came down heavily on all fours 
again, an action that stirred the 
white dust, and blew a snort of dis- 
tress. 

“Yai, yai!” kel Dahacha rebuked 
the lot of the dusei, using that 
meaningless word that had a 
thousand meanings between dus and 
kel’en. They shied away, the nine 
of them, dismissed, hovering in a 
knot near the edun, ears pricked. 



Some sat. Now and then one would 
rise and walk the circuit of the 
group of dusei, a different one each 
time; and each time that one would 
eye the advancing caravan of regul 
vehicles and utter small whuffs of 
warning. 

The Kel was veiled, for meeting 
outsiders. Niun secured the mez a 
proper degree higher and took his 
place in their black rank, one 
among others; but kel’anth Eddan 
took him by the elbow and drew 
him to the front of the group. 

“Here,” said Eddan, and no 
more. A man would not jabber 
questions with the Kel in such a 
mood. Nium held himself silent, his 
heart constricted with panic at Ed- 
dan’s gesture. He was a novice, 
even at his age; he did not belong 
in the fore of question-and-answer 
with regul, here between Eddan and 
kel Pasev, oldest masters of the 
Kel. 

Unless it involved him person- 
ally. 

Or a kinsman. 

Of a sudden he knew that a mes- 
sage must have been passed to the 
edun through the Sen-tower, some 
intelligence of events that the edun 
possessed and that he had missed, 
sitting alone, vainly anticipating 
pleasure in this day. 

Something was fearfully amiss, 
that regul had intervened between 
mri kinsmen. 

The regul caravan ground its slow 
way upward, the sound of its 
motors audible now. The sun beat 
down, wanly red. Out on the flats a 
geyser spouted: Elu, one of the 
dangerous random ones that kept no 
schedule. Its plume continued for a 
time, ten times the height of a man, 



48 



GALAXY 




and assumed its characteristic slant. 
Then it quickly dissipated. It was 
possible to recognize each of the 
geysers of the flats by its charac- 
teristic pattern and location. Niun 
reckoned that if Elu had erupted, 
Uchan would not be long in follow- 
ing. It was a precious moment of 
distraction, in which it was not 
necessary to consider the sinister 
line of dark vehicles laboring their 
way upslope. 

One . two . three . four 
. five . six. 

Six landsleds. No more than two 
had ever come to the edun at once. 
He did not make this observation 
aloud. The Kel about him stood ut- 
terly rigid, like images against 
which black robes fluttered in the 
strong wind. Each kel’en’s right 
hand was at the belt where the as-ei 
were sheathed, fingers slipped 
within the belt. This was warning, 
understood by another kel’en. The 
regul, being mere tsi’mri, had likely 
not the sense to recognize it; but it 
was courtesy all the same to advise 
intruders that they were not wanted, 
whether or not the intruder had the 
wit to recognize a warning. 

The sleds bounced over the final 
ruts in the ascending road, came at 
last to a dusty halt even with the 
front entry to the edun, fronting the 
Kel. Motors were cut off, leaving 
sudden silence. Regul opened doors 
and began laboriously to disembark: 
a full ten of regul younglings, sober 
and joyless, without even visible ar- 
rogance. One of them was the 
Nom-guard, Hada Surag-gi. Niun 
recognized it by the badges and the 
robes, which was the best way to 
recognize any individual regul. It 
was also likely, he reflected bit- 



terly, that the regul Hada Surag-gi 
recognized him by his distinctive 
lack of badges; but the youngling 
came forward to face Eddan, and 
consequently himself, and gave no 
sign of recognition. Hada’s eyes did 
not even linger. There was no hint 
of insolence. Hada Surag-gi sucked 
air and rocked forward, a regul 
courtesy. 

There was a proper mri response 
to this, a gesture of reciprocal good 
will. Eddan did not make it, and 
therefore no mri moved. Hands 
stayed by the as-ei. 

“Favor,” said Hada Surag-gi. 
“We bring most tragic news.” 

“We are prepared to hear what 
you say,” said Eddan. 

“We trust that our elder informed 
you—” 

“Do you bring us Medai?” asked 
Eddan harshly. 

Hada turned, an awkward motion 
for a regul, made a shifting of feet. 
It closed its hands and made the 
gesture that wished its assistants to 
perform their duties. They shuffled 
about the second sled and opened 
its storage, lifted out a white, 
plastic-encased form on a litter. 
They bore it forward and carefully 
set it down at the feet of Hada 
Surag-gi, before the Kel. 

“We have brought the remains of 
Medai,” said Hada. 

Niun knew, already, had known 
from Hada’s first words; he did not 
move, nor even lower his visor. 
This steadiness might be mistaken 
by some of his brothers for self- 
control. But it was numbness. He 
heard their movings, their stirrings 
about the scene, as if they and he 
were in different places, as if, di- 
vorced from the scene, he watched 



FADED SUN

from elsewhere, leaving the flesh of 
Niun s’Intel, like that of Medai s’ln- 
tel, senseless and unparticipant. 

“Are the humans that close?” 
asked Eddan, for it was the custom 
to give the dead of the People who 
had died in the war to cold space 
where they had died or, better still, 
to the fires of suns, recalling the 
birth of the People, rather than to 
make a long and inconvenient jour- 
ney from the fighting front to inter 
them in earth. All the People would 
choose, if they had the choice, to 
avoid earth burial. It was strange 
that regul, knowing mri even 
slightly as they did, could have 
misunderstood this and made the 
mistake of returning a dead mri to 
his edun. 

The regul younglings — showing 
no arrogance at all in their manner 
now — let air flutter their nostrils 
and by other signs looked uncom- 
fortable in their mission. 

Guilty, was the bitter thought that 
came to Niun, watching them. He 
came back to his own body and 
fixed his eyes on the eyes of Hada 
Surag-gi, willing that youngling to 
meet his gaze directly. For an in- 
stant Hada did so, and flinched. 

Guilty and uncomfortable in this 
whole meeting, and trying not to 
say the half of what they knew. 
Niun trembled with anger. He found 
his breath short. There was no 
move from the Kel. They stood ab- 
solutely still, one with the mind of 
Eddan who led them, who with a 
word could lead them to a thing no 
mri had ever done. 

Hada Surag-gi shifted weight on 
bowed legs and backed a little from 
the shrouded corpse between them. 
‘‘Kel’anth Eddan,” Hada said, “be 



gracious. This kel’en wounded him- 
self and would not have the help of 
our medical facilities, although we 
might perhaps have saved him. We 
regret this, but we have never at- 
tempted to violate your beliefs. We 
bring you the regrets also of bai 
Hulagh, in whose service this kel’en 
gained great distinction. It is bai 
Hulagh’s profound regret, his most 
profound regret, that this meeting is 
an inauspicious one and that he 
makes the acquaintance of the 
People in such a sad moment. He 
sends his condolences and offers his 
extreme personal distress at this 
most unhappy event and — ” 

“Bai Hulagh is then the new 
commander of this zone. What of 
bai Solgah? What of the Holn?” 

“Gone.” The word was almost 
swallowed before momentum was 
quickly resumed. “And the bai 
wishes, kel’anth, to assure you 
of—” 

“I surmise,” said Eddan, “that 
the death of kel Medai is very re- 
cent.” 

“Yes,” said Hada, deterred from 
the prepared speech. His mouth 
worked, seeming to search for 
words. 

“Suicide.” Eddan used the vul- 
gar word, although regul knew the 
meaning of the mri word ika’al 
where it regarded the ritual death of 
a kel’en. 

“We protest — ” In gazing di- 
rectly at the kel’anth, the youngling 
seemed to lose its thread of thought, 
which was an impossibility with the 
eidetic regul. “We protest vehe- 
mently, kel’anth, that this kel’en 
was in deep melancholy that had 
nothing to do with the accession of 
bai Hulagh to command or the fall 



50

from power of the Holn. We fear 
that you are drawing the wrong in- 
ference. If you suppose that — ” 

“I did not advance any statement 
of inference,” said Eddan. “Do 
you suggest that one might be 
made?” 

The regul, interrupted more than 
once, confounded by argument that 
was no argument, confused as regul 
easily were when dealing with mri, 
blinked rapidly and tried to regroup. 

“Kel’anth, I protest. Be gra- 
cious. We only stated that this kel’en 
was in deep melancholy prior to his 
act, that he had been confined in his 
quarters by his own choice, refusing 
all attempts to inquire into his 
needs, and that this had nothing to 
do with the accession of bai 
Hulagh — in no wise, sir, in no 
wise. Bai Hulagh became employer 
to this kel’en and this kel’en served 
him with great distinction in several 
actions. There was nothing amiss. 
But after the peace was announced, 
kel Medai evinced an increasing 
melancholy.” 

“You are of the Nom,” Niun in- 
terrupted, unable to bear it longer, 
and Hada Surag-gi looked in his di- 
rection, black eyes wide, showing 
whites in amazement. “How is it 
that you report accurately on the 
state of mind of a kel’en who was 
on a ship far removed from you?” 

It was not his place to have spo- 
ken. From a kel’en youth before 
strangers, it was an outburst, not an 
acceptable behavior; but the Kel 
stood firm, and as for Hada Surag- 
gi, its mouth flew open and shut 
again in a taut line. 

“Elder,” it protested to Eddan. 

“Can the bai’s spokesman answer 
the question?” asked Eddan, a vin- 



dication that sent a flood of fierce 
gratitude through Niun. 

“Most gladly,” said Hada. “I 
know these things to be fact be- 
cause they are exactly as given to 
me by the bai himself, face to face, 
by his word. We had no idea that 
the kel’en contemplated such an ac- 
tion. It was not due to any animos- 
ity toward his service.” 

“Yet it is abundantly evident,” 
said Eddan, “that kel Medai con- 
sidered that he had sufficient reason 
to quit your service, such strong rea- 
son that he chose ika’al to be free 
of you.” 

“This was doubtless because of 
the end of the war, which this 
kel’en did not desire.” 

“It is,” said Eddan, “curious 
that he would have elected ika’al 
when he knew that he was returning 
to home world.” 

“He was despondent,” said Hada 
Surag-gi, an illogicity that the regul 
did not seem to comprehend. “He 
was not responsible for his ac- 
tions.” 

“You are speaking before his 
kinsmen,” said Eddan sharply. 
“This was a kel’en, not a dus, to 
go mad. He was bound for 
homeworld. What you say he did is 
not reasonable unless the bai 
offended against his honor. Is it 
possible that this was what hap- 
pened?” 

The regul, under the sting of Ed- 
dan ’s harsh voice, began to retreat 
slightly, a sidling backward by the 
hindmost. 

- “We are not done with questions,” 
Eddan said, fixing Hada Surag-gi 
with his stare. “Tell us where and 
when kel Medai died.” 

The regul did not want to answer.

It sucked air and visibly changed 
color. “Favor, kel’anth. He died 
during the previous evening on the 
ship of the bai.” 

“On the ship of bai Hulagh?” 
“Kel’anth, the bai protests — ” 
“Was there any manner of dis- 
cussion passed between the bai and 
the kel’en?’’ 

“Be gracious. T^ie . kel’en was 
despondent. The end of the war — ” 
“The bai made this mri despond- 
ent,” Eddan said, discomfiting the 
youngling utterly. 

“The bai,” said Hada, nostrils 
dilating and contracting in rapid 
breaths, “requested of this mri that 
he remain in the ship and remain in 
service; the kel’en refused, wishing 
to leave at once, a privilege the bai 
had denied to everyone, even him- 
self. There were matters of business 
to attend to. It is possible — ” the 
skin of the youngling went paler as 
it spoke; its lips faltered upon the 
words. “Kel’anth, I realize that 
there is possible blame in your eyes; 
yet we do not understand the ac- 
tions of this kel’en. The bai com- 
manded him to wait. Yet the kel’en 
found fault with the order sufficient 
that he committed this act. We do 
not know why. We assure you we 
are greatly distressed by this sad 
event. It is an hour of crisis for 
Kesrith, in which this kel’en would 
have been of great service to the bai 
and to yourselves, surely. The bai 
valued the service of kel Medai. We 
protest again that we do not under- 
stand the source of his bitterness 
with us.” 

“Perhaps you did not inquire, or 
listen,” said kel’anth Eddan. 

“Be gracious. Kesrith has been 
ceded to humans. We are in the 

52 



process of the evacuation of all res- 
idents of Kesrith. Arrangements 
are being made also for the mri of 
Kesrith. The bai wishes his ship 
manned at all hours, and he wishes 
the crew, naturally — ” The young- 
ling moved uneasily, looking at Ed- 
dan, who did not move. “Tliese are 
affairs over which we have no con- 
trol. If the kel’en had only informed 
the bai of his extreme desire to have 
an exception granted in his case — ” 

“Kel Medai chose to leave his 
service,” said Eddan. “It was well 
done. We do not want to talk to 
youngling regul on this subject any 
longer. Go away now.” 

This was plainly put, and the re- 
gul, degree by degree, retreated, 
more rapidly as they neared their 
sleds. Hada was neither the first nor 
the last seated. Hatches were 
closed, engines started; the land- 
sleds lumbered clumsily into a turn 
on the narrow and rutted roadway 
and retreated down the long slope 
as slowly as they had come. 

No one moved. There was a hush 
in the air now that the regul had 
gone, leaving them alone with their 
dead. 

And suddently in the doorway, 
gold-robes and white, stood the 
sen’anth and Melein, and the 
she’pan herself on their arms. 

“Medai is dead,” said Eddan, 
“and the world is going to humans 
soon, as we suspected.” 

He lifted his robed arms to shield 
the she’pan from the sight; and Me- 
lein started forward a step, only a 
step: it was forbidden her. She veil- 
ed herself and turned her face 
away, bowing her head; and 
likewise the she’pan and the 
sen’anth veiled, which they did not 



GALAXY 




do save in the presence of the unac- 
ceptable. 

They went away into the edun. 
Death was the peculiar domain of 
the Kel whether in inflicting it or 
mourning it; and it was for diem to 
attend to the proprieties. 

For a kinsman within the Kel, it 
was a personal obligation. 

Niun knew that he was expected 
in this to take charge; and he saw 
that the others longed to help, to do 
something, and he opened his 
hands, gave them leave. He had 
only heard the rites, had never per- 
formed them, and he did not wish 
to shame himself or Medai by his 
ignorance. They gathered up the lit- 
ter, he and all who could find space 
to help, and passed within the doors 
of the edun, toward the Pana’drin, 
the Shrine, to present Medai at his 
homecoming, where he would have 
presented himself first had he lived. 

Niun’s hands felt the warm metal 
of the litter frame; he looked down 
on the object in white that had been 
his cousin and the shock that had 
held him numb until now began to 
meld into other feelings, into a deep 
and helpless rage. 

It was not right that this had hap- 
pened. There was no justice if this 
could happen. He found himself 
almost trembling with anger, with a 
violence in which he could kill if 
there were anyone or anything 
against which to direct his rage. 

There was no one. He tried to 
feel nothing; that would be easier 
than to try to find a direction for the 
resentment that boiled within him. 
He had hoped. He schooled himself 
not to hope henceforth. The world 
was mad, and Medai had added 
himself to the madness. 



My last son, the she’pan had 
once called him. Now it was true. 

VII 

There was a screen in the Shrine 
of the edun of the People, worked 
in metals and precious stones and 
over-written with ancient things. It 
was old beyond reckoning, and in 
every Shrine that had ever existed 
this very screen had stood, between 
the lamps of bronze that were of 
equal age with it. In life it marked 
the division between the Kel and 
the Sen, the point past which the 
Kel might not tread; in death it was 
no more crossable. 

Before the screen, at its very 
base, they laid the white-shrouded 
body of Medai s’lntel Sov-Nelan, as 
close to the dividing line as a kel’en 
could ever come. Incense curled up 
from burners on either side of the 
screen, heavy and cloying, over- 
hanging the room and obscuring the 
ceiling like a smoky canopy. 

For Niun, attendant to his cousin, 
the scent of incense held its own 
memories, of being in the Kath and 
of watching holy rites from that 
least, outermost room, when he had 
been a child with Melein and Medai 
beside him, and others now gone, 
whose deaths he knew. From that 
outer room the small Shrine of the 
Kel had seemed mysterious and 
glorious, a territory where they 
might not yet venture, where war- 
riors in their sigai might move, dis- 
daining the Kath. 

His mind ran to a later day, when 
they three had been taken among 
the black-robes, one with the Kel, 
and had been allowed for the first 
time to enter the middle Shrine, 



FADED SUN 



53

only to realize that yet another bar- 
rier lay between them and the Pana, 
the Mysteries; and a day later yet, 
when they had prayed for the wel- 
fare of Medai, who was leaving the 
edun for service, greatly hon- 
ored — and Niun had died inwardly 
that night with jealousy and bitter- 
ness, his prayers insincere and 
hateful and mingled with thoughts 
that came back now like guilty 
ghosts. 

He felt no different now than 
then. Medai had taken another de- 
parture, leaving him the ugliness, 
the loneliness, of Kesrith. 

Medai had never endured the 
things he had endured: left behind, 
last guard to the House, servant to 
the others. 

Medai was counted a great kel’en 
for what he had done. 

There was a whisper of robes in 
the holiness dimly visible beyond 
the screen where the Sen met and 
tended the Holy Objects. Melein 
would be there, with Sathell. 

Three children an age ago had 
stood within the outer Kath-hall and 
longed for honor; and now they had 
their prayers back in strange and 
twisted ways: Niun within Kel- 
shrine, where they had all longed to 
go; Medai possessing the honors of 
a warrior, newly wandering the 
Dark; and Melein, Melein the 
light-hearted, had passed through 
Kel-shrine to the place beyond, to 
the Mysteries that were never for a 
kel’en to see. 

He bowed down, shaking with 
rage and frustration, and remained 
so for a time, trying to take his 
breath back again and compose 
himself. 

A hand touched his shoulder. A 



dark robe brushed him with shadow 
as Eddan sank down beside him. 
“Niun,” the kel’anth said in a soft 
voice. “The she’pan calls you. She 
does not want you to have to sit this 
watch. She says that she wants you 
to come and sit with her this night, 
and not to go to the burial.” 

It took him a moment to be sure 
of his voice. “I do not believe it,” 
he said. “I do not believe that she 
will not loose me even for this. 
What did she say? Did she give no 
reason?” 

“She wishes you to come, now.” 
He was stunned by such an at- 
titude. There had been no love be- 
tween himself and Medai. The 
she’pan knew that well enough, but 
there was no decency in what she 
asked him to do publicly. 

“No,” he said. “No, I will not go 
to her.” 

The fingers dug into his shoulder. 
He expected rebuke when he looked 
up. But the old man unveiled to 
him, showing his naked face, and 
there was no anger there. 

“I thought you would say so,” 
Eddan said, which was incredible, 
for Niun had not known himself. 
He had spoken on impulse. But the 
old man knew him that well. “Do 
as you think right,” Eddan said fur- 
ther. “Stay. I will not forbid you.” 
And the old man rose and or- 
dered the others, who moved about 
their separate tasks. One brought 
the vessels of ritual, given by the 
Sen, that were for burying and set 
them at Medai ’s feet; Pasev brought 
water; and Dahacha cloths for wash- 
ing; and ‘Palazi filled the lamps for 
the long vigil; and Debas whistled 
softly to the dusei and took them 
from the outer hall, herding them 



FADED SUN 



55 




away into the tower of the Kel so 
that they should not disturb the 
solemnities. 

In the midst of the activity Niun 
sat, conscious finally that he had 
tom his robe in his haste for de- 
scending from the hills and that he 
was dusty and his hands were foul 
with dirt. Feet pattered about him. 
Sirain came, half-blind Sirain, and 
gave him a damp cloth and Niun 
unveiled and washed his face and 
veiled again, grateful for Sirain’s 
thoughtfulness. Liran brought a robe 
for him and he changed his siga in 
the very Shrine, for it was not re- 
spect to sit the watch in disorder. 
He sat down again and began to be 
calmer at their quiet, efficient min- 
istering. 

Then, at Eddan’s whispered 
word, they began to take the ugly 
white shroud from Medai, and pa- 
tiently, patiently the fingers of one 
and the other of them tore the web- 
bing that was as close-spun as a co- 
coon and well-nigh impenetrable — 
like c/io-silk it was, having to be 
unraveled with the fingers. But 
Pasev knew to touch the regul fiber 
with a burning wick and so to part 
the strange web. The material 
burned sullenly, but it gave way, 
shedding its chemical smell into 
sickening union with the incense 
that lowered overhead. 

It was something on which they 
all silently agreed, that they would 
not give to burial a kel’en in a regul 
shroud, whatever the inconvenience; 
and gradually they recovered Medai 
from the web, revealing a face that 
they well remembered, a counte- 
nance still and pale. The body was 
small and thin in death, pitifully so; 
it weighed very little, and Medai 



had been a strong man. The honors 
that they found laced to his belts 
were many, and the seta’al were 
weathered to pale blue on his face. 
He had been a handsome youth, had 
Medai s’lntel, full of the life and 
the hope of the edun in brighter 
days. Even now he was fine to see. 
The only marring of him was the 
blood that stained the fiber under 
his central ribs, where he had dealt 
himself his death-wound. 

Suicide. 

Niun worked, not looking at 
Medai’s face, trying not to think of 
what his hands did lest they tremble 
and betray him. He was trying to 
remember better days, but could 
not. He knew Medai too well. His 
cousin was in his dying as he had 
been in life: selfish, arrogant to 
match regul arrogance, and stubborn 
with it all. It was wrong to hold 
anger with the dead, impious. But 
in the end Medai had been as use- 
less to his kinfolk as he had always 
been. Medai had lived for himself 
and died for his own reasons, re- 
garding nothing that others might 
need of him; and there was precious 
little honor for a cold corpse, what- 
ever the high traditions of the Kel. 

They had parted in anger. He re- 
membered, each day of his life for 
six years he had remembered, and 
he knew why the she’pan had 
wanted him upstairs and what was 
surely in the minds of his brother 
kel’ein who sat with him. There had 
been a quarrel, the av’ein-kel , the 
long blades drawn; it had been his 
own fault, drawing first in the 
Shrine-hall, outside. It was the day 
that Medai had laid hand on Me- 
lein. 

And Melein had not objected. 



56 



GALAXY 




The she’pan herself had put an 
end to that quarrel. Abler in those 
days six years gone, she had de- 
scended the tower stairs and inter- 
vened. Had called him eshai'i, 
lack-honor, and tsi’daith’ , un-son, 
and because he had then loved her, 
it had crushed him. 

But not a word, never a word of 
rebuke, to Medai. 

And for Medai within a hand of 
days came the honor of service to 
the bai of the regul, an honor that 
might have gone to one of the Hus- 
bands; and for Melein came the 
chastity of the Sen. 

And for Niun s’lntel came noth- 
ing, only a return to study, a 
long, long waiting, pinned to the 
Mother’s side and held from any 
hope of leaving Kesrith. 

There had never been a way to 
undo that one evil day. Intel would 
not let him go. He had hoped for 
peace with Medai, for a change in 
the affairs of the People. 

But Medai had robbed him of 
that too. It was on him alone, the 
service of homeworld, and there 
had never been any justice in it. 

When you have made up your 
mind what it is the People owe you, 
Eddan had said, come and tell me. 
He would have settled for half of 
what Medai had had. 

But then, beginning with Eddan, 
the Kel spoke of Medai, each prais- 
ing him: ritual, the lij'aiia, begin- 
ning the Watch of the Dead; and the 
voices of the old kel’ein shook in 
the telling of it. 

“It is hardest,” said Liran, “that 
the old bury the young.” 

And last of all but himself, 
Pasev. “It is certain,” she said, 
touching the medallions, the j’tai 



that glittered in the lamps’ golden 
light, the honors that Medai had 
won in his services, “that although 
he was young, he has traveled very 
far and seen a great deal of war. I 
see here the service of Shoa, of 
Elag, of Soghrune, of Gezen and 
Segur and Hadriu; and it is certain 
that he has served the People. 
Surely, surely he has done enough, 
this brother of ours, this child of 
our House; I think that surely he 
was very tired. I think he must have 
been very weary of service to the 
regul, and he would have come 
home as best he could, with what of 
his strength he had left. I under- 
stand this. I also am very tired of 
the service of regul; and if I knew 
my service was at an end, I would 
go the road he took.” 

And then it should have been 
Niun’s time to speak, praising 
Medai, his cousin. He had gathered 
angry words but he could not, after 
that, speak them or contradict the 
feelings of Pasev, whom he loved 
with a deep love. He sank down 
and lowered his head into his cross- 
ed arms, shaking with reaction. 

And the Kel allowed him this, 
which they seemed to take for a 
kinsman’s grief. But theirs was a 
true, unselfish sorrow for a child 
they had loved. His was for him- 
self. 

In this he found the measure of 
himself, that he was capable of 
meanness and great selfishness, and 
that he was not, even now, the 
equal of Medai. 

The "others talked around him, 
whispering, after such a time as it 
became clear that he would not 
choose to speak in the ritual. They 
began finally to speak of the high 



FADED SUN 



57 




hills, the burial that they must ac- 
complish, and woven into their 
speech and their plans was a quiet 
desperation, a shame, for they were 
old and the hills were very far and 
the trail very steep. They wondered 
unhappily among themselves wheth- 
er the regul might not, at their re- 
quest, give them motorized trans- 
port; but they felt at heart that they 
dishonored Medai by asking such 
help of the regul. They would not, 
therefore, ask. They began to con- 
sider how they might contrive to 
carry him. 

“Do not worry,” said Niun, 
breaking his long silence. “I can 
manage it myself.” 

And he saw in their faces doubt, 
and when he thought of the steep 
trails and the high desert, he him- 
self felt doubt. 

“The she’pan will not allow it,” 
said Eddan. “Niun, we might bury 
him close at hand.” 

“No,” said Niun; and again, 
thinking of the she’pan, “No.” 
And after that there were no more 
suggestions to him. Eddan quietly 
signed at the others to let be. 

And they left him when he asked 
of them quietly and with propriety 
to be left alone. They filed out with 
robes rustling and the measured ring 
of honors on their garments. The 
tiny, high sound of it drew at 
Niun’s heart. He considered his 
own selfishness, lately measured, 
and the courage of his elders, who 
had done so much in their lives; and 
he was mortally ashamed. 

But he began to think — in the 
slow beginning of his night-long 
watch, in the silences of the edun, 
where elsewhere others were in pri- 
vate mourning — and knew that he 



was not willing to die, whatever the 
traditions of his caste, and that he 
did not want to die as Medai had 
died, above all else; and this 
thought ate at him, for it was con- 
trary to all that he was supposed to 
be. 

Medai had been able to accept 
such things, and the she’pan had 
accepted Medai. And this was what 
it had won him. 

It was blasphemy to entertain 
such thoughts before the Shrine, 
there in the presence of the Gods 
and the dead. For himself he was 
ashamed, and he longed to run 
away as he had done often when he 
was a child, going into the hills to 
think alone, to try himself against 
the elements until he could forget 
again the pettinesses of men, and of 
himself. 

But he was reckoned a man now 
and it had been long since he had 
had that freedom. Dangerous times 
were on the edun, hard times, and it 
was not an hour that' Niun s’lntel 
could afford to play the child. 

There was a matter of duty, of 
decencies. Medai had lived and died 
by that law. Niun could not manage 
the inner part of himself, but he 
could at least see to it that the outer 
man did what was dutiful to those 
who had to depend on him. even 
if it were totally a lie. 

“Niun.” 

The stir, the whisper from be- 
yond the screen, the sigh he had 
taken for the wind that blew con- 
stantly through the Shrine. He 
looked up now and saw a hazed 
golden figure through the intricate 
design, and knew his sister’s voice. 
She crossed the floor as far as the 
screen that divided them, religi-

ously, though custom permitted 
them to meet face to face elsewhere 
in the edun and outside its limits. 

“Go back,” he wished Melein, 
for she violated the law of her caste 
by being in the presence of the 
dead, even a dead kinsman. Her 
caste had no debts of kinship; they 
renounced them and all such obliga- 
tions. But she did not leave. He 
rose up, stiff from kneeling on the 
cold floor, and went to the 
grillwork. He could not see her dis- 
tinctly. He saw only the shadow of 
her hand on the lacery of the 
screen, and matched it with his own 
larger one in sympathy, unable to 
touch her. He was unclean and in 
the presence of the dead, and would 
remain unapproachable until he had 
buried his kinsman. 

“I am permitted to come,” she 
said. “The she’pan gave me 
leave.” 

“We have done everything,” he 
assured her, struck to the heart re- 
membering that there had been af- 
fection between Melein and Medai, 
cousinwise, and at the last, perhaps 
more than cousinly. “We are going 
to take him to Sil’athen — everything 
that we can do, we will do.” 

“I had not thought you would 
watch here,” she said. And then, 
with an edge of utter bitterness: 
“Or is it only because you were di- 
rectly ordered not to?” 

Her attack confused him. He took 
a moment to answer, not knowing 
clearly against what manner of as- 
sumption he was responding. “He 
is kin to me,” he said. “Whatever 
else ... is no matter now.” 

“You would have killed him 
yourself once.” 

It was the truth. He tried to see 



Melein’s face through the screen; he 
could see only the outline, golden 
shadow behind gold metal. He did 
not know how to answer her. 

“That was long ago,” he said. 
“And I would have made my peace 
with him if he were alive. I had 
wanted that. I had wanted that very 
much.” 

“I believe you,” she said finally. 

She left silence then. He felt it on 
him, an awkward weight. “It was 
jealousy,” he admitted to her. The 
thing that he had pondered took 
shape and had birth, painfully, but 
it was not as painful as he had 
thought it would be, brought to 
light: Melein was his other self. He 
had been as close as thought to her 
once — and he could still imagine 
that closeness between them. 

“Melein, when there are only 
two young men within a Kel, it is 
impossible that they not compare 
themselves and be compared by 
others. He had first all the things I 
wanted to excel in. And I was jeal- 
ous and resentful. I interfered be- 
tween you. It was the most petty 
thing I have ever done. I have paid 
for it, for six years.” 

She did not speak for a moment. 
He became sure that she had loved 
Medai: Only daughter of an edun 
otherwise fading into old age, it 
was inevitable that she and Medai 
should once have seemed a natural 
pairing, kel’en and kel’e’en, in 
those days that she had also been of 
the Kel. 

Perhaps — it was a thought that 
had long tormented him — she would 
have been happier had she remained 
in the Kel. 

“The she’pan sent me,” she said 
finally, without answering his offer- 



FADED SUN 



59 




ing to her. “She has heard of the 
intention of the Kel. She does not 
want you to go. There is disturb- 
ance in the city. There is uncer- 
tainty. This is her firmest wish, 
Niun: Stay. Others will see to 
Medai.” 

“No.” 

“I cannot give her that answer.” 

“Tell her that I did not listen. 
Tell her that she owes Medai better 
than a hole in the sand and that 
these old men cannot get him to 
Sil’athen without killing themselves 
in the effort. ’ ’ 

“I cannot say that to her!” Me- 
lein hissed back, fear in her voice; 
and that fear made him certain in 
his intentions. 

It made no more rational sense 
than the other desires of Intel, this 
she ’pan that could gamble with the 
lives of the People, that could bend 
and break the lives of her children 
in such utter disregard of their de- 
sires and hopes. She has given me 
her virtues, he thought with a sud- 
den and bitter insight: jealousy, self- 
ishness, possessiveness . .ah, pos- 
sessive, of myself, of melein, the 
children ofZain. She sent Melein to 
the Sen and Medai to the regul 
when she saw how things were drift- 
ing with them. She has ruined us. A 
great she’pan, a great one, but 
flawed, and she is strangling us, 
clenching us against her until she 
breaks our bones and melts our 
flesh and breathes her breath into 
us. 

. .Until there is nothing left of 
us. 

“Do as you have to do,” he 
said. “As for me, I will do him a 
kinsman’s duty, truesister. But then, 
you are sen’e’en and you do not 



have kinsmen anymore. Go back 
and say what you like to the 
she’pan.” 

He had hoped, desperately, to 
anger her, to pierce through her 
dread of Intel. He had meant the 
words to sting, just enough. But her 
hand withdrew from the screen and 
her shadow moved away from him, 
becoming one with the light on the 
other side. 

“Melein,” he whispered. And 
aloud: “Melein!” 

“Do not reproach me with lack 
of duty,” her voice came back to 
him, distant, disembodied. “While 
he lived, I was a kinswoman to him 
and you were grudging of every- 
thing he had. Now I have other ob- 
ligations. Say over him that the 
she’pan is well-pleased with his 
death. That is her word on the mat- 
ter. As for me, I have no control over 
what you do. Bury him. Do as you 
choose.” 

“Melein,” he said. “Melein, 
come back.” 

But he heard her footsteps retreat 
up hidden stairs, heard doors close 
one after another. He stayed as he 
was, one hand against the screen, 
thinking until the last that she 
would change her mind and return, 
denying that answer she had made 
him; but she had left. He could not 
even be angry for it was what he 
had challenged her to do. 

Intel’s creation. But his too. 

He hoped that somewhere in 
Sen-tower Melein would lay down 
her pride and weep over Medai, 
though he doubted it. The coldness, 
the careful coldness, that had been 
in her voice was beyond all repent- 
ance, carrying the schooled detach- 
ment of the Sen. 



60 



GALAXY 




He left the screen finally and sat 
down by the corpse of Medai. He 
locked his hands behind his neck, 
head bowed on his knees, twice des- 
olate. 

The lamps snapped and the fires 
leaped, the door of the edun having 
been left open this night in ancient 
tradition, a respect to the dead. 
Shadows danced and made the writ- 
ings on the walls seem to writhe 
with independent life, writings that 
the she ’pan said contained the his- 
tory and wisdom of the People. All 
his life he had been surrounded by 
such things: Writings covered every 
wall of the main hall and the Shrine 
and the she’pan’s tower, and the 
accesses of Kath and Kel — writings 
that the she’pan said were dupli- 
cated in every edun of the People 
that had ever existed, exact and un- 
varied. Through such writings the 
sen’ein learned. The kel’ein could 
not. He knew only what had hap- 
pened within his own life and 
within his own sight, or those 
things he had heard his elders re- 
call. 

But Melein could read the writ- 
ings and knew what truth was, as 
did the she’pan, and she had grown 
cold and strange in that knowledge. 
He had asked once, when Melein 
was taken into the Sen, if he could 
not be taken too: They had never in 
their lives been separated. But the 
she’pan had only taken his hands 
into hers and turned the calloused 
palms upward. Not the hands of a 
scholar, she had said and dismissed 
his appeal. 

Something stirred out in the hall, 
a slow shuffling, a click of claws 
on stone; it was one of the dusei, 
strayed from the Kel-tower. They 



generally went where they chose, 
none forbidding them, not even 
when they were inconvenient or de- 
structive. It was not certain that one 
could forbid them, for they were so 
strong that there could be no coer- 
cion. They sensed, in the peculiar 
way of dusei, when they were 
wanted and when not, and rarely 
would they remain where they were 
not desired. 

They understood the kel’ein, the 
belief was, whose thoughts were 
unfearing and uncomplex, and for 
this reason each dus chose a kel’en 
or kel’e’en and stayed lifelong. One 
had never set affection on Niun 
s’lntel, though once he had tried 
— shamefully desperate — to trap a 
young one and to coerce it. It had 
fled his childish scheme, smashing 
the trap, knocking him unconscious. 

And never after that had he found 
any skill to draw one after him, as 
if that one, betrayed, had warned all 
its kind of the nature of Niun s’ln- 
tel. 

The elder kel’ein said that it was 
because he had never truly opened 
his heart to one, that he was too 
sealed upon himself. Niun thought 
this false, for he had tried; but he 
also thought that the sensitive dusei 
had found him bitter and discontent 
and could not bear it. 

He believed so, hoping that this 
would change; but in the depth of 
his heart he wondered if it were 
possibly because he was not a natu- 
ral kel’en. For a woman of the 
People, all castes were open. For a 
man, there were only Kel -caste and 
Sen; and he had been deprived in 
one sense and over-indulged in 
others simply because he was the 
last son of the House. It had meant 



FADED SUN 



61 




that he received the concentrated ef- 
forts of all his teachers, that they 
had worked with him until he had 
understood, until his skill was ac- 
ceptable. 

But in an edun full of sons and 
daughters, he thought that he might 
have failed to survive: His stubborn- 
ness would have brought him early 
challenge and the People might then 
have been rid of his irritance in the 
House. He thought that he might 
have been a better kel’en if not for 
the Mother’s interference; but then, 
many things might have been dif- 
ferent if he were not the last, and so 
might she. 

Medai had pleased the Mother; 
and Medai was dead; but he sat 
here living, a rebel son to the 
Mother. She would have somewhat 
to say to him after Medai ’s burying 
in the hills, when he must come 
back and face her. Thereafter would 
be bitter, bitter words and himself 
without argument, and Melein on 
the she’pan’s side in it. He shrank 
from what the she ’pan might say to 
him. 

But she would have to say it. He 
would not unsay what he had said. 

Again the scrape of claws. It was 
a dus. The explosive sough of 
breath and the heavy tread made it 
clear that the intruder was coming 
closer, and Niun willed it away 
from the Shrine, for dusei were not 
welcome here. Yet it came on. He 
heard it enter the outer room and he 
turned and saw it in the dark, a 
great slope-shouldered shadow. It 
made that peculiar lost-sound again 
and slowly edged closer. 

“Yai!” he said, turning on one 
knee, furiously willing it out. 

And then he saw that the dus was 



dusty and that its coat was patched 
with crusted sores, and his heart 
froze in his chest and his breath 
caught for he realized that it was 
not one of their own tame beasts, 
but a stranger. 

Sometimes wild dusei would 
come down off the high plains to 
hover around the lands of the edun 
and create havoc among the tame 
ones; in his own memory kel’ein 
had died trying to approach such an 
animal, even armed. Dusei sensed 
intentions, uncannily prescient; 
there were few animals more 
dangerous to stalk. 

This one stood, head lowered, 
massive shoulders filling the door- 
way, and rocking back and forth, 
uttering that plaintive sound. It 
forced its way in, making the plas- 
ter crumble here and there, though 
the door was purposely made small 
and inconvenient for dusei, to pro- 
tect the Mysteries from their mind- 
less irreverence. 

It came, irresistible, thinner than 
the well-fed dusei of the edun. Niun 
edged aside, one of the lamps crash- 
ing down as the dus shouldered it. 
It whined and whuffed and fortu- 
nately the spilled fire went out, 
though the hot oil stung its foot and 
made it. shy aside. Then it ap- 
proached the body of Medai and 
pawed at it with claws as long as a 
man’s hand — poisonous, the dew- 
claw possessing venom-ducts, the 
casual swipe of them capable of 
disemboweling mri or regul. 

Niun crouched in the shadow by 
the overturned lamp, as unmoving 
as the furniture. The beast’s body 
filled much of the room and 
blocked the doorway. It gave off a 
fearsome, sickly stench that over- 



62 



GALAXY 




rode even the incense; and when it 
turned its massive head to stare at 
the frail mri huddled in the comer, 
its eyes showed, running, dripping 
rheum onto the hallowed floor. 

Miuk! The Madness was on him. 
The secretions of his body were out 
of balance and the miuk, the Mad- 
ness of his kind, was to blame for 
his behavior, sending him into a mri 
dwelling. There was nothing Niun 
knew, neither beast nor man, more 
to be feared than this. If the dusei 
of the edun had not been locked up- 
stairs this night, they would never 
have let a miuk’ko dus come near 
the edun; they would have died in 
defense of that outer doorway rather 
than allow that beast in. 

And Niun s’lntel prepared himself 
to die, most horribly, in a space so 
small that the dus could not even 
cast his body from underfoot; his 
brothers would find him in shreds. 
The creature prodded at the body of 
Medai as if in prelude to this, but it 
hesitated. Grotesque, horrid, it 
rocked to and fro, straddling the 
corpse, its eyes streaming fluid that 
blinded it. From some far place in 
the Kel -tower there was a deep 
moan, a dus fretting at its unaccus- 
tomed confinement, at the mood of 
the mourning Kel — or sensing inva- 
sion downstairs, trying desperately 
to get out. Others joined in, then 
fell abruptly silent, hushed perhaps 
by the order of the kel’ein. 

Niun held his breath while the 
rogue lifted his rheum-blinded eyes 
toward that sound, mobile lips 
working nervously. It rocked. It 
gave another explosive snort and 
shifted its weight, easing aside. Its 
shoulder hit the screen, toppling it 
with a brazen crash, and the beast 



whirled, bathed in the glow from 
the inner Shrine. Niun flung his arm 
over his eyes in horror lest he see 
the Forbidden, and then, surety in 
his heart, he reached for his gun, 
futile against a dus. 

He must attack whatever 
threatened the Forbidden, to pre- 
vent, if he could, the invasion of 
the Sen-shrine. He sighted for the 
brain, the first of the two brains, 
knowing full well that the following 
convulsions would destroy him 
along with the dus. 

But the dus did not take that step 
beyond. It lowered its weeping head 
and nosed at the corpse, disarrang- 
ing the veil; and when it had done 
so, it moaned and slowly, almost 
distractedly, swung its head about, 
putting its shoulder between its head 
and the gun, and began to withdraw 
from the Shrine. 

And when it had done so, when 
it walked the hall outside, still giv- 
ing that lost-infant sound, for the 
first time Niun clearly knew it. 

Medai ’s dus. 

There was no mri who could 
claim, other clues removed, to 
know any dus but his own, and not 
even that one given much passage 
of time. Dusei were too similar and 
too mutable, and one could only say 
that this one was like the other dusei 
he knew. 

But that this particular one had 
not killed him, that it had been 
primarily interested in the body, 
that it had departed unsatisfied — 
these actions Niun understood. 
Dusei were troubled at death. Other 
animals ignored the dead but dusei 
did not understand, did not accept 
it. They grieved and searched and 
fretted, and eventually died them- 



FADED SUN 



63 




selves more often than not. They 
rarely outlived their masters, pining 
away in their search. 

And this one was hunting some- 
thing it had not found. 

Medai’s dus, come looking for 
him. 

A dus that was sickly and cov- 
ered with sores and deep in the 
throes of a madness that did not 
come on swiftly, although regul 
said that Medai had died but a night 
ago. 

A dus that was as thin and 
starved as its dead master. 

A chill feeling grew in Niun until 
he was physically shivering, not 
alone from dread of the dus. He 
holstered his gun and glanced fear- 
fully at the nakedness of the inner 
Shrine, on which he ought never to 
have looked. 

It should not have happened. He 
washed his hands with the water of 
the offerings and, without setting 
foot across the forbidden line, he 
set the screen in place again, his 
fingers reverent on the inanimate 
metal. He had lived. The Gods, like 
men, could forgive the irreverence 
of dusei; and he had looked within 
the Sen-shrine and felt shaken, but 
not to the death. He had seen 
brightness but nothing of the Ob- 
jects, or nothing that he could iden- 
tify as the Holy. He tried to put this 
from his mind. It was not for a 
kel’en to have seen. He did not 
want to remember it. 

And Medai — 

He set up the lamp again, and re- 
filled it, and lighted it, restoring its 
comforting glow. Then on his knees 
he mopped up the spilled oil that by 
the mercy of the Gods had not kept 
on burning; and all the while he 



worked, exhausted and trembling 
from his vigil, he thought and 
nursed the cold feeling that lodged 
under his heart. 

At last he washed his hands for 
respect and laid them on Medai for 
the irreverence he had to commit: 
The thought homing in his mind 
gave him no peace otherwise. He 
did it quickly, once he had gathered 
his courage; carefully he unfastened 
the clothing and examined the 
wound, and found it — shaming his 
suspicion and his act — as the regul 
had said. 

Ika’al. 

“Forgive me,” he whispered to 
the spirit of Medai; and reverently 
he reclosed the robes and gently 
washed the face and replaced the 
veils. Then he cast himself on his 
face before the Shrine and made the 
proper prayers to the several 
Ancestor-gods of his caste for rest 
for the soul of Medai, summoning 
forth more sincerity than he had 
ever felt for his cousin when he was 
living. 

This should have absolved him 
and given him peace, having sur- 
rendered to that which was proper 
and honest, but it did not. He had 
within him a gathering certainty 
that, whatever the evidence of his 
eyes and the testimony of the regul, 
Medai had not lain down his life 
willingly. 

The dus, so close to a kel’en’s 
mind, was miuk’ko and grown so 
thin that it could pass Shrine doors; 
and the body of Medai, once solid 
with muscle, was as thin as the 
mummified dead. 

Kel-quarters were independent 
units within the regul ship-plan be- 
cause of the dusei, which the regul

could have stopped the air and cast nikin and went out to the outer hall, 
him into cold space afterward. But to the door, where the mad dus still 







crouched before the edun. 

He had known it would be there, 
waiting. It was near what it desired, 
but could not find it. He had been 
as sure of its lingering there as he 
was sure how it had been driven 
mad. It was no less dangerous for 
its once having been tame; it could 
still rise up and kill on impulse. But 
when he set the water before it, it 
sniffed at the offering curiously and 
at last bestirred itself, nosing down 
into the liquid. The contents of the 
pannikin disappeared. Niun filled it 
a second and a third and a fourth 
time, and only at the fourth did the 
beast suddenly avert its head in re- 
fusal. 

He sank down on his heels and 
studied the creature, thin as it was 
and its fur gone in patches. A great 
open wound was fresh on its side. 

Medai’s dus . come from 
regul care; from violence, from 
starvation. It would not have left 
Medai of choice even after he was 
dead. 

Regul would not act as mri would 
act. They were capable of collusion, 
of bribery, of deceit, of slaughter of 
their own young; but never of mur- 
der of an adult, never of that. They 
could neither kill nor lie in cold 
blood: They hired mri to attend to 
their enemies. 

So Niun had always been taught 
by those who knew the regul better 
than he, by those who had dealt 
with regul lifelong. 

So he had implicitly believed. 

As had Medai. 

He rose and walked inside, back 
to the Shrine, and sat down beside 
the body of his cousin, arms locked 
about himself, staring without com- 
prehension at the serpentine writings 



that recorded and concealed the his- 
tory of the People. 

Murder had been done in one 
manner or another, whatever name 
the regul gave it. A kel’en had been 
killed by his own employers and his 
dus weakened to the point that they 
could drive it out to die naturally; 
one body to be returned to the Kel, 
the act of ignorant regul; another to 
be disposed of by predators and 
scavengers, rendered incapable of 
betraying what had happened. Regul 
hands and regul conscience were 
doubtless clean. Medai had finally 
done as they had wished. 

Niun wished desperately to go 
upstairs and tell someone. He 
wished to run to Eddan for counsel, 
to alert the she’pan. But he had noth- 
ing for proof but a beast that lay 
outside the door. He had nothing on 
which to hang such an accusation, 
no shape to his suspicion, no mo- 
tive he could reckon that would 
have driven the regul to compel a 
kel’en to such an action: 

It was irony of a kind, he 
thought, that of all whom Medai 
might have trusted to see to his a- 
venging, he had come to the hands 
of his oldest rival; and the only 
likely witness of the truth was a 
miuk'ko. 

Dusei, it was said, lived in the 
present; they had no memories for 
what had happened, only for per- 
sons and places. The miuk’ko had 
sought home, the House where it 
had first lived; it had sought Medai. 
It had found the one, and not the 
other.

P ing! 

Cheryl Harbottle sat up, startled. 
She looked around the room for 
the source of that odd little noise. 
Nothing seemed to be wfong. The 
lighting panels were still glowing at 
the Midday-Summer setting and the 
Woodland Sounds background tape 
was still giving out with soft coos, 
twitters and the sound of rustling 
leaves. 

Her eyes finally came to rest on 
the new decorator lamp. Humph. 
That must be the problem. The 
damed thing was burned out or 
something. It looked funny. 

Cheryl got up and walked over to 
peer at it. There was nothing in the 
middle where something should 
have been, she realized, wrinkling 
her slim brows. There really was 
nothing. All of the wires were in 
place but the bright, glowing ball in 
the middle was gone. What was 
worse, she couldn’t see through the 
space where it was supposed to be. 
The air looked rather fuzzy, or dis- 
torted. It was almost like looking 
into rippling water. 

Cheryl bent closer to peer at it 
and something grabbed at her nose. 
She yelped and jumped back. Then 
she rubbed the end of her offended 
member and stared at the lamp. 
Well! She had the distinct feeling 
that it shouldn’t do that. She walked 
around to look at the other side. 
There was barely enough room for 
her to edge into the comer behind 
it. 

The lamp was a pole-like struc- 
ture. One end was moored in the 
ceiling and the other stood on the 
floor. The middle blossomed out 
into an elaborate mesh of gleaming 
wires resembling a big cage. 



Cheryl poked an experimental 
finger at the nothing in the middle. 
At about two inches from the center 
something took hold of it. She 
pulled her hand back rapidly and 
pursed her lips. What she needed 
was the instruction book. Of course 
there wasn’t one. She hadn’t seen 
an instruction manual for anything 
in years. Well, the computer ought 
to know something. 

She sat down in front of her 
Insta-Think home terminal, flicked 
it on and asked for a catalog. The 
alphabetic listing on the screen rol- 
led by slowly and she stopped it at 
“Lamps, decorator.’’ That was how 
she’d bought the fool thing in the 
first place. The computer obligingly 
switched to its collection of sixty- 
second advertisements. 

Eventually, after watching what 
seemed like an endless array of 
lighting fixtures in all sizes, shapes, 
styles and colors, she saw her lamp. 
“New lighting Concept’-’ the ad 
proclaimed in fiery letters. “Cap- 
ture the Sun in Your Living 
Room!” 

Cheryl pressed the MORE button 
on the terminal and the system cy- 
cled into the full three -minute sales 
pitch. Not that it told her much. A 
vibrant baritone informed her that 
she’d be the envy of the neighbor- 
hood and pointed out the benefits of 
“metal-sheen polybutyrate,” what- 
ever that was. She pressed the 
MORE button again when the ad 
was over and got an expressionless 
voice that talked about hydrogen, 
ignition and containment systems, 
energy pulses and electromagnetic 
balance. The picture on the screen 
was a maze of interconnecting lines 



68 



GALAXY 




with squiggles, boxes and numbers. 
Out of sheer spite she pushed the 
advance button once more but all 
she got was a picture of long strings 
of mathematics and a theory lecture 
that made no sense at all to her. 
Cheryl switched off the terminal ir- 
ritably and swiveled around to look 
at the broken lamp. 

Well, it probably would be best 
to turn it off. Then she might as 
well call Repair. Let them handle it. 
Damn, she'd had the fool thing for 
only a week. That was the trouble 
with the modem world — nothing 
was made right any more. At least 
there was a thirty-day warranty, she 
thought tiredly. She should have 
bought one of those cute little an- 
tique lamps with the glass bulbs. 

She got up and walked over to 
switch the lamp off. Nothing. As a 
matter of fact, the nothing was still 
there. She flicked the switch on and 
off again but the funny little distor- 
tion in the middle stayed right 
where it was. A little experimenta- 
tion with a writing stylus proved 
that the pull was still there too. 

Cheryl frowned. Odd, very odd. 
Something was working but how 
was it working with the power off? 
She pushed the stylus at it again 
and this time let the lamp grab it. 
The stylus moved forward 
smoothly, and to her horror, it dis- 
appeared into the lamp. Gone, finis, 
kaput. 

Ridiculous! 

Cheryl circled the lamp warily, 
her eyes wide. She picked up a 
china figurine she’d always hated 
and offered it as a sacrifice. There 
seemed to be a little difficulty drag- 
ging it through the wire maze but 



eventually the figure was gobbled 
up. That was sort of gratifying, ac- 
tually. 

Keeping an eye on the nothing 
spot, Cheryl began to carefully bend 
some of the matrix wires out of the 
way. 

Eventually she had a clear open- 
ing to the center, which didn’t seem 
to affect the spot at all. She had a 
feeling she’d just voided her thirty- 
day warranty but she’d gone too far 
to stop now. She offered the lamp 
her morning paper and watched 
with a sort of clinical detachment as 
the pages curled inward, compres- 
sed together and turned into a fun- 
nel that slowly disappeared into the 
nothingness. Where the devil was it 
going? Big things just couldn’t be 
put inside of little things. 

On the other hand, maybe the 
spot was bigger on the inside than it 
was on the outside. There had to be 
a limit though. With a slightly fien- 
dish smile, she picked up a large 
plastic fern, pot and all. 

Now that really was too much! 
When the potted fem was gone, she 
offered up last season’s overcoat, an 
old pair of shoes, her husband’s 
tacky old fishing hat, that awful 
painting Louise gave them at 
Christmas and an extra pair of salt 
shakers. At differing rates of speed 
they all vanished down the insati- 
able maw of the lamp. 

She’d fix the damned thing. 
Cheryl pried the matrix wires fur- 
ther apart and began to bend them 
back and forth. Eventually they 
snapped off and ruthlessly she 
shoved each one into the spot. In 
less than twenty minutes she man- 
aged to feed most of the lamp to it- 



THE NOTHING SPOT

self. Not even a burp. All she had 
left were the two bare poles, top 
and bottom, which she couldn’t pull 
loose. And the spot, of course. 
Cheryl thought wistfully of the old 
saying. “Crawl into a hole and pull 
the hole in after you.” This hole 
obviously wasn’t going anywhere. It 
completely ignored the fact that 
most of its parent structure was 
gone and hung there about five feet 
from the floor. She could see a 
good two inches, top and bottom, 
between it and the poles. It was 
balanced somehow. 

“With no visible means of sup- 
port,” Cheryl said out loud, with 
just a touch of panic. She could see 
it a lot better now. Well, she could 
see what she couldn’t see a lot be- 
tter. It seemed to her when she bent 
carefully to look, that there was a 
tiny black speck in the middle of 
the distortion but she couldn’t be 
sure. 

She got a ball of cord from the 
twins’ room and dangled the end 
enticingly over the spot. The cord 
straightened and moved gently for- 
ward. She experimented a little, 
pulling the cord out and letting it be 
caught again. Eventually, however, 
it was grabbed for good. It moved 
inexorably forward. She braced her 
feet, leaned back and pulled. No 
good. The cord kept moving and 
the spot stayed put. She unwound 
more cord and tied it firmly around 
the big armchair. The spot ate up 
the slack and the armchair began to 
inch its way across the room. When 
the cord shortened enough that the 
chair began to lift into the air, she 
decided the experiment had gone far 
enough. 



Unfortunately Cheryl was better 
at tying knots than undoing them. 
She ran around the apartment franti- 
cally but by the time she turned up 
a pair of saf-T-Shears in the den, 
the spot was administering the 
coup-de-grace. Cheryl watched 
helplessly as her Komfy Kushion 
chair, with Genuine Imitation 
Tufted Vinyl upholstery, slowly de- 
formed and funneled its way into 
the spot. 

Migod, there was no stopping 
it! It seemed to be immovable and 
it had the appetite of a growing 
teenager. Cheryl felt a sudden cold 
shiver. What if one of the kids 
bumped into it? She gulped and 
wished she hadn’t destroyed the 
cage that had fenced it in. Cheryl 
dashed into the bedroom and strip- 
ped one of those awful orange pol- 
kadot blankets from the bed. At 
least she could wrap up the thing so 
no one would blunder into it. There 
wasn’t any cord left but a little 
rummaging turned up two garish 
ties belonging to her husband. 

Back in the living room Cheryl 
carefully gathered one end of the 
blanket around the lower pole and 
tied it firmly with a green plaid tie. 
Then she folded the blanket up over 
the tie, brought it around the spot 
and gathered it to the top pole, leav- 
ing plenty of slack in the middle. 
She secured it with the other tie and 
adjusted a frivolous bow as a whim- 
sical farewell to the spot. There it 
was, swathed like a pot-bellied 
mummy. Cheryl drew a deep sigh 
of relief. 

Her relief was short-lived, how- 
ever. The blanket folds began to arc 
inward — until she was staring at an 
acrylic hourglass. The waist nar-

GALAXY 




rowed, disappeared, and the top and 
bottom of the blanket started to 
strain toward the center. Eventually 
the fibers gave way with a sicken- 
ing “rrrrrip!” Cheryl found herself 
looking at two strips of orange pol- 
kadot garnish, one on each pole. 
And a slightly askew purple- and 
red-striped bow. The spot shim- 
mered contentedly. 

Cheryl ran to the computer termi- 
nal to call Repair and then stopped 
suddenly. Repair what? Not the 
lamp. It was virtually gone. The 
spot didn’t need repair; it was work- 
ing just fine. Residence Mainte- 
nance? Was it a Maintenance prob- 
lem when you had a bottomless pit 
in your living room? They might 
even accuse her of having put it 
there and then sue her for lowering 
the property value. 

She stared glassy-eyed at the little 
monster. Maybe she should rope off 
the comer, put up caution signs and 
warning blinkers. Cheryl giggled 
with a growing touch of hysteria. 
How about charging admission? 
“See the eighth wonder of the 
world! Watch the Harbottle Spot 
devour Cincinnati!” 

On the other hand . Cheryl 
calmed herself and frowned at the 
spot. It ate things up, did it? Finally 
she walked over to the computer 
terminal and keyed in a number. 
When she got the connection, she 
said, “Hello, this is Mrs. Harbottle 
in 1743, B Level. I want to discon- 
tinue my rubbish-disposal service. 
I’ve made other arrangements.” 

Now all she had to do was find 
some tasteful drapes that would go 
with the rug . and those orange 
polkadots, of course. ★

Artists don’t seem 
to fit in — even in an 
institution designed 
forihem. 

Eric Beldone shivered as he 
floated free in the vastness of space. 
The twin suns gave no warmth; they 
merely growled in an infinite ocean 
of numbing black tranquillity. Eric 
frowned and thoughtfully rubbed his 
depilated cranium. 

“Suppose- they both went nova?” 

They did. 

He shaded his eyes against the 
dazzling brilliance. “No, no, no! 
Too much! Too much! Go black!” 
And he was plunged into the sable 
darkness of the womb. 

“Oh, my eyes! I’m probably 
blind.” 

“The effect is purely psychologi- 
cal.” 

“Yeah, yeah, I know. All in my 
head.” Beldone sighed. “Okay. 
Environment standard.” 

The blackness gradually ebbed 
and Eric rose from a pale, con- 
toured chair, rubbing his eyes. He 
was surrounded by a milky opacity. 
The walls, the floor, the ceiling and 
everything in the den had a frosty 
albino turbidity. Stark against this 
background, the thin, slight, black- 
clad author stared across the room 
at the IBMC transcriber. He walked 
over to the machine and tentatively 
held his outstretched fingers over 
the sensiplate. They hovered uncer- 
tainly, then balled into a fist and 
struck. 

In master control a reading of 



.384 registered on the scan grid cor- 
responding to Beldone’s den. Minia- 
ture red lights in series circuit spelled 
out ‘mild irritation.’ A technician 
logged the readout. 

“How long have I been here 
without accomplishing anything?” 
“One week, two days, four 
hours, seventeen minutes, six sec- 
onds, seven, eight. ...” 

“All right, enough.” Beldone 
glanced around at the misty white- 
ness of the den. He snapped his 
fingers. “Ceiling — mauve; floor — 
deep brown pile; walls — coffee, 
with light cream perhaps. Ummm. 
Desk and low tables in wood-grain 
mahogany and all the chairs in soft 
black calfskin.” 

He watched as around, above and 
beneath him the den slowly and aes- 
thetically changed hues and flowed 
into the shades he had specified. He 
walked about the room, touching 
various objects and coloring them, 
stopping at the transcriber, which he 
made beige. Craning his neck, he 
pointed at a spot on the ceiling and 
requested a directional lightbeam. 
Having adjusted the intensity, he 
looked around and fingered his chin 
thoughtfully. 

“Let’s have three of those Kes- 
sler prints I pre-selected, hmm? One 
there, one over there and,” point- 
ing, ”... I think, there! Yes. Yes, 
that will do. Hmm. A deeper brown 
on the carpet, a bit thicker on the 
pile. Yes, fine. Fine. Code it.” 

‘ ‘Coded. Environment scheme 
S-5, Mr. Beldone . ” 

“S-5. Wonderful. I’ll never re- 
member it but it’s in there some- 
where. Who cares? God, I’m 
bored. ’ ’ 

He reclined in the contoured

chair, enjoying the feel of the sup- 
ple black leather, and fished an an- 
cient briar freehand from his pouch. 
He liked the ritual of cleaning, fill- 
ing, tamping and lighting. It gave 
his hands something to do and it 
kept him from thinking too much 
about the transcriber, sitting as if 
with an air of expectancy on the 
other side of the room. 

As he smoked there came a 
knock at the door. It slid aside to 
reveal a young, sallow, black-haired 
boy with slate-gray eyes and two 
steaming cups of coffee. 

“Thought you might like some.” 
“Why not? Come on in, Oz.” 
Beldone sat forward and took one 
of the cups, placing it on a low ta- 
ble. Then he looked up and wagged 
an accusing finger at the ceiling. 
“You sent him, didn’t you?” 
“Answer not required,” smiled 
Oz. “Eric, you did say you were 
bored. Besides, I wasn’t getting any 
work done either. Drink your cof- 
fee, it’s costing you enough.” 

Eric smiled. “My treat, eh? 
While Big Brother watches,” he 
said as he sipped, pointing a finger 
toward the ceiling. 

“It’s not up there, you know. It’s 
three floors down.” 

“Yes, I know. But it feels like 
it’s up there. Watching over all of 
us. Omnipotent. Sexy and omnipo- 
tent.” 

“Sexy? You relate to a female 
voice?” 

“Mmmm. I’m basically submis- 
sive to females. Why, how does it 
address you?” 

Oz smirked. “With the voice of 
an art teacher I had as a child. The 
one who thought I had creative po- 
tential. Right, teach?” 



“Right, Ozzie , ” answered an el- 
derly male voice. 

“You see? It’s all supposed to be 
very therapeutic. You know that 
famous actor on the fifth floor?” 
“You mean Richard Rosswell?” 
“Yes, that’s the one. The critics 
haven’t been very kind to him late- 
ly. They always shoot for the man 
at the top, you know? Now they say 
he’s ‘lost his method.’ Well, it 
gives him his mother’s voice.” 

Eric gave a low whistle. “That’s 
a bit deep, isn’t it? I’d hate to see 
his psych profile.” 

“I’d hate to see my own,” Oz 
chuckled. “How’s work, or 
shouldn’t I ask?” 

Eric shrugged. “Lousy. You 
want to hear some of it?’ ’ 

Ozzie looked surprised. “I 
thought you were one of those who 
didn’t like to share work in prog- 
ress.” 

“I don’t usually, but this junk is 
in absolute stasis. I’ve never written 
such crap. I’m beginning to hate 
that thing,” he said, indicating the 
transcriber. “Play back my most re- 
cent fiasco.” 

After a moment his own voice, 
with the hems and haws edited out, 
began speaking.

High overhead, the 
massive Public Welfare 
tote-board winked on 
and off, informing all 
prospective applicants of 
job openings and clos- 
ings, positions vacated 
due to death or illness 
and. 

“Enough, enough!” Eric winced 
as he interrupted the playback. 
“Erase it, for pity’s sake!” 

“That wasn’t so bad,” Oz be- 
gan. “I was beginning to get in- 
terested. Why — ” 

“Please! Spare me.” Eric wrin- 
kled his nose in distaste. “It was 
hideous! I’m ashamed of myself.” 

“ Program erased," announced a 
soothingly sultry voice. 

“Wonderful, isn’t she? It? I wish 
I could have some of my early 
works erased like that. So. 
Enough.” He shifted abruptly in the 
contour chair. 

“When are you going to show 
me this fabulous painting of 
yours?” 

The young artist fidgeted uncom- 
fortably. “I’m sorry, Eric. I can’t. 
Not just yet. I mean, well . you 
know how it is.” 

“Sure, kid. I know. But I want 
to be first in line when you finish 
it, understand?” 

Oz smiled. “I’ll arrange a private 
showing. Promise.” 

Beldone clapped the youngster on 
the shoulder affectionately. “There 
you go! Come on, what do you say 
we go for a swim?”

Dr. Anwar Sharif nervously 
drummed his be-ringed fingers on 



the surface of his heavy marble 
desk. Seated before the desk in the 
opulently simple office were the 
staff psychotherapists of the Tuni- 
sian Institute of Creative In- 
telligence. 

“Are we ready?” he asked 
softly, his English laced with a sub- 
tle, gutteral sibilance. “Very well. 
Record. ’ ’ 

“ Recording answered the com- 
puter in a mechanically neutral 
voice. 

Dr. Sonia Feldman consulted the 
clipboard on her lap. This was to be 
a conference of personal observation 
only; clinical history was im- 
mediately available from the com- 
puter. 

“Richard Ross well, computer 
case code #973186-B. Patient is 
British. Fifty-eight years old. Occu- 
pation: actor. Entering first week of 
third month of treatment. Mr. 
Rosswell shows evidence of latent 
schizophrenia. There is a tendency 
to develop a minor fixation on the 
computer identification voice pat- 
tern. Possibly it may have been a 
mistake to utilize his mother’s voice 
print. Nothing very serious, in my 
opinion. Re-evaluation is in prog- 
ress, however. 

“Patient’s overall condition is 
satisfactory. He seems to be re- 
sponding well to role play in stress 
situations. Physical health is good 
but up-date on psych profile reveals 
alcoholism projection probability.” 
She smiled. “A lot of that seems to 
be going around. Hypnotherapy 
and/or PCP-91 injections should 
take care of it.” 

“What is the prognosis, Dr. 
Feldman?” asked Sharif. 

She shrugged. “I see no reason

why we can’t have him out of here 
by the end of next week.” 

Sharif nodded. ‘‘Next case?” 

Dr. Sigmund Wu cleared his 
throat uneasily. “Oswald Star- 
kovski, computer case code 
#973159-B. Patient is Nepalese, 
naturalized. Twenty-eight years of 
age. An artist, a painter to be pre- 
cise. Entering fourth week of treat- 
ment. 

“Patient has massive insecurities. 
Self-image is a problem, with total 
lack of self-confidence, etc., etc. A 
textbook case of what we refer to in 
his particular field as the Van Gogh 
syndrome. He has a pathological 
hate/love relationship with his work. 
Makes Dostoevsky look like Ogden 
Nash. That was not meant to be 
facetious, by the way. He really 
does. He cries frequently or, I 
should say, weeps. For some reason 
he either cannot or will not vocalize 
his frustrations — which, of course, 
only makes everything worse. He 
seems to relate well to other pa- 
tients. It’s only when he is alone in 
the den that he falls apart. 

“What is interesting is that he 
works as hard as he does. Spends 
very little time brooding and what 
have you. Day after day, hour after 
hour, he’s at the easel, working 
with tears streaming from both 
eyes.” Wu shook his head sadly. 
“A perfectionist who, ironically, 
does not believe himself capable of 
even nearing perfection.” 

“Prognosis?” 

“Not good. Patient seems to be 
headed for a complete breakdown. 
Drug therapy or electro-probe 
would, in my opinion, be only a 
stop-gap measure. We have two 
separate problems in ethics here. On 



the one hand, we’re supposed to 
help him achieve some degree of ar- 
tistic stability. That’s what he’s 
paying for.” 

“And on the other hand?” 

Wu sighed. “Logically he should 
be induced to stop painting. Give it 
up completely. As I said, it poses a 
problem in ethics. Quite a shame, 
actually. 1 think he has genuine po- 
tential.” 

Sharif pulled at his lower lip. 
“You mentioned two problems. 
What is the second?” 

“The second is that he can’t af- 
ford us. He did have the funds but 
he has spent his entire inheritance 
and now, according to finance 
check, he is drawing on a very 
meager savings account. My point 
is that he has no income outside of 
his painting. In another week he 
will be penniless.” 

“I see,” said Sharif. “Well, that 
is not our responsibility. We have 
to concern ourselves only with the 
psychic welfare of the patient and 
his various muses. In view of his 
limited funds, however, it may be 
advisable to convince him to give 
up his painting. I would venture to 
say that vocational conditioning 
might be a possible solution. Very 
well. Next?” 

Dr. Anne Cleaver crossed her at- 
tractive legs and brushed a stray 
lock of auburn hair from her face. 

“Eric Beldone, computer case

activities have entailed teaching 
seminars, media presentations and 
art criticism for the magazine of the 
Ars Nova Society, which he 
founded. Although his work in 
these fields is highly regarded, the

“What is he doing ?” 

The intern watched in rapt fasci- 
nation. “Doodling.” 

“He’s what ?” 

Anne Cleaver stood before the 
monitor screen, watching as her pa- 
tient, through spoken commands 
and finger-strokings on the sensitive 
walls, created flowing, mandala-like 
designs five feet across. Straight 
lines became arcs, curving back on 
themselves in symphonies of color. 
It was a tangled, complex, asym- 
metric execution with a sense of 
unity among the constantly undulat- 
ing patterns. The mad mandala pul- 
sated. Expanded and contracted. 
Beat like a heart. 

The intern marveled at the effect. 
“I’m recording duplicate tapes of 
all of these,” he said. “He’s been 
at it for the past four hours and this 
one is the third design. I want 
copies of these for myself. They’re 
beautiful, aren’t they?” 

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen 
anyone use the den like this be- 
fore,” Anne mused. “It has a sort 



of optical-illusion effect.” 

The intern increased magnifica- 
tion. “I believe he started here,” he 
said, indicating a point on the 
screen. “To tell you the truth, I’m 
not really sure — and I’ve been 
watching all along.” 

“It’s fantastic,” murmured the 
doctor. “I would have suspected a 
creative breakthrough but he’s not 
writing. He’s — ” 

“Want to see something else in- 
teresting?” The intern interrupted, 
switching to bioscan. “Check on 
his increase in respiration and pulse 
rate. Look at the adrenalin count 
and — ” 

Wu’s shout from the adjacent 
console cut him short. “Anne! 
Starkovski’s about to enter Bel- 
done’s den! I just saw what he was 
doing!” 

“Quick,” Anne ordered, grab- 
bing the intern by the shoulder. 
“Manual override!” And reaching 
past him, she channeled full sub- 
sonic into the writer’s den. Almost 
simultaneously the wall cleared, 
Beldone collapsed in a heap on the 
floor and Oz Starkovski entered the 
den. 

“Eric?”

“Mr. Beldone, how do you feel 
when you write?” 

“How do you feel now?” he 
countered. “It’s hard to say. A de- 
tached awareness sometimes. A 
conscious effort on one level, I 
suppose, and yet there’s a sort of 
ethereal state involved. Almost clin- 
ical in the sense that I’m attempting 
to craft a story or an idea, convey a 
sense impression — like standing 
outside of myself and observing

with a critical eye. How can you 
describe something like that? Being 
a writer, I should be able to tell you 
but even those of us who are most 
glib have a hard time finding the 
right words. Often it’s impossible. 

“Yet there are times when every- 
thing gels so incredibly well that I 
get the impression I have absolutely 
no control over what’s happening. I 
believe that during those agonizing 
periods of bleeding, of sitting there 
facing that inactive transcriber, the 
subconscious is working full-steam 
without my being aware of it. Then 
it’s like a marathon runner getting 
second wind. There’s a euphoric 
feeling I can’t describe. All of a 
sudden it comes. It flows! It’s like 
someone or something taking con- 
trol of my body and I watch in rapt 
fascination as the story inexplicably 
writes itself. The characters begin to 
speak, move, interact — ” 

Anne froze the tape. The image 
of Beldone, immobile on the wall 
of her office, remained with arms 
raised in mid-gesture. This, Anne 
thought, was the celebrated author 
lionized by the media. The garru- 
lous guest, the penultimate compan- 
ion, the compelling lecturer. But 
there was also something else. 

“Increase magnification,” she 
said. Beldone’s image slowly 
loomed larger on the wall until the 
face was ten times its normal size. 
“Hold.” 

There was something about his 
eyes. She recalled the conversation 
clearly and at the time she had had 
a sense of intimate communication 
with this man. Yet, looking at his 
face now, at the slightly glazed eyes 
with a barely perceptible muscular 
tightness about the comers, she re- 



alized that he had not been speaking 
to her at all. While they spoke, he 
had withdrawn. 

He was trying to remember. Eric 
Beldone, one of the most scintillat- 
ing, prolific authors of his time, 
was trying to remember the magical 
feeling of creation. It hardly seemed 
possible. Where had he lost it and 
why? 

“Resume run, normal scan.” 

The image of Beldone, reduced 
to normal size, resumed talking. 

“ — live out their lives completely 
independent of the author. You 
can’t dictate to them any more be- 
cause they have developed their 
own personalities and their own 
ways of doing things.” Abruptly he 
was speaking to her again. “I know 
it sounds trite, but that’s what it’s 
like. I wish I could say it better be- 
cause it’s a wonderful thing.” 

“You really love writing, don’t 
you?” 

He snorted. “I hate it!” 

That had taken her by surprise. It 
was evident in her voice as she 
heard herself asking, “What? 
But. .1 don’t understand.” 

Beldone chuckled. “I’m not sure 
I do either. You know, there’s noth- 
ing I can think of that’s more 
frightening than facing that infernal 
machine — in effect, facing nothing, 
and from that nothing, creating 
something. It’s not natural. I spoke 
to Rosswell about it the other day 
before he left and, in a way, he un- 
derstands that feeling. He said that 
the most terrifying part of a 
psychorama is that first step into the 
empty staging area because an actor 
has to fill that empty space with the 
life and presence of a persona. And 
if he feels the least bit out of touch 



78 



GALAXY 




with his role, if he’s not completely 
immersed in it, the audience will 
know it instantly. It’s really easier 
for an actor because he already has 
a script to work with. Can you imag- 
ine how hard it is, how painful, 
to completely immerse yourself in 
something that doesn’t even fully 
exist? 

“I don’t know. Words fail. Hey! 
That’s funny, isn’t it? Writer’s 
block? Words fail?” Beldone sighed 
deeply. ‘‘God. You’re miserable 
when you’re writing — and you’re 
miserable when you’re not.” 

She stopped the tape. What Dr. 
Wu had said about the Starkovski 
case was somehow very similar. 
Despair seemed to be a common 
factor in certain creative per- 
sonalities. If that despair were re- 
moved. 

“Has Mr. Beldone arrived yet?” 

“ He’s waiting outside." 

“Send him in.” 

Beldone entered, looking none 
the worse from his unexpected sub- 
sonic sedation of the day before. 

“Who do I have to thank for this 
headache?” he grumbled. 

“Me, I’m afraid,” answered Dr. 
Cleaver, handing him two small, 
clear capsules. “Here, these should 
help somewhat.” 

Eric squinted at the powder-filled 
capsules. “What are they?” 

“Aspirin.” 

He chuckled. “Some things never 
change. Do you mind telling me 
why I was zonked? Did the com- 
puter decide I was drawing dirty 
pictures?” 

“It wasn’t computer action,” 
Anne replied. “When I said that 
you had me to thank for your 
headache, I was speaking quite lit- 



erally. I was in auxiliary control 
and I ordered a switch to manual 
override.” 

“Ah! The thick plotens!” said 
Beldone with mock drama. “ You 
decided I was drawing dirty pic- 
tures!” 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Beldone. I re- 
alize that I’m being somewhat cir- 
cumspect but you see, there is 
another case involved here and I am 
a bit hesitant to divulge certain de- 
tails. However, I doubt you’ll ac- 
cept that?” 

He shook his head. “No, I think 
I’m entitled to know why 1 was 
treated to a full dose of subsonics. I 
want an explanation.” 

“Very well,” she said. “How 
familiar are you with Oz Starkovski’ s 
case?” 

Beldone watched her closely. 
“I’ve followed his progress as an 
artist for some time now and I’ve 
had occasion to review his work in 
multi-dimensional injection. How- 
ever, to a trained eye it’s evident 
that he’s headed for a complete 
nervous collapse. His paintings are 
full of sorrow and despair, much 
like those of Van Gogh’s later 
period.” The writer sighed. “As for 
his case, Oz doesn’t like to talk 
about it very much. You people 
don’t seem to be helping him.” 

Anne noticed, not for the first 
time, that the writer had a disquiet- 
ing way of coming on like a father 
figure. She was certain that it was 
pure, conscious manipulation on his 
part. 

“Well, Mr. Beldone, I don’t 
want to get into the details of 
another doctor’s case but the fact is 
that Oz was about to enter your den 
and emergency measures had to be

taken. Dr. Wu determined that the 
sight of your, uh, artwork would 
have disturbed his patient and I’m 
inclined to agree with him.” 

“Disturbed him?” Beldone 
shouted. “Let me tell you, young 
lady, it would have had to have 
been one hell of a ‘disturbance’ for 
you people to dose a man of my age 
like that! What were you afraid 
of?” 

Anne found herself rising to the 
bait. “Oz Starkovski’s condition is 
very delicate, Mr. Beldone. You, 
on the other hand, despite your age 
(or in spite of it), are in excellent 
physical and psychological health. 
The only thing wrong with you is 
an arteriosclerotic condition that 
might kill you in another thirty or 
forty years.” 

“And Oz is in much worse con- 
dition than that,” Eric said softly. 
“Is that what you’re saying?” 

Anne Cleaver licked her lips 
nervously and sighed. “You missed 
your calling, Mr. Beldone. You 
should have been a lawyer.” She 
took a cigarette of synthetic tobacco 
from a silver box on her desk and 
lit it, inhaled and held the smoke in 
her lungs for a long moment before 
releasing it in a slow, steady 
stream. “You know, I’m going to 
have to go back to the real ones. 
These just don’t make it any 
more.” 

The consultation was not progress- 
ing at all the way she had planned. 
Her office looked out onto the cen- 
tral gardens and she briefly watched 
the therapy group in laser sculpture 
twelve stories below. 

“Anne,” said the writer quietly, 
“tell me. Maybe I can help.” 

She turned and faced him. “For 



the present, Mr. Beldone, I’m more 
concerned about your own — ” 

“My problem can wait,” he in- 
terrupted sharply. “Tell me about 
Oz.” 

He could be a most compelling 
man. “I wish I could tell you. I re- 
ally do. But I just can’t take that re- 
sponsibility. I can tell you this 
though — it’s imperative that some- 
thing be done to help him soon.” 
She recalled Dr. Sharif’s words 
about vocational conditioning. 
“Very soon. Or it will be too 
late.” 

“He’s in that much danger?” 

“Not in the way you think. I 
can’t tell you any more, Mr. Bel- 
done. It’s a delicate situation. But 
there is a very real danger that Oz 
Starkovski may never paint again.” 
“But painting is his whole life!” 
“That’s all I can say. I really 
shouldn’t have told you as much as 
I have. I didn’t call you up here for 
that purpose.” 

“I know,” said the writer. He 
rose to his feet and started to leave. 
He stopped at the door. “I’ll try to 
help if I can. My problem can 
wait.” 

After he left, Anne spent a long 
time watching the door through 
which he had gone. There was 
something he had said that repeated 
itself in her mind and she knew it 
was important. He had said it twice: 
“My problem can wait.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“This environmental scheme is 
depressing you, Ozzie. Why not add 
a little color? Some trees perhaps. 
Something relaxing. You’ve been 
working so much, driving yourself 



80 



GALAXY 




so hard. How about a little 
sunshine ?” 

Oz looked around at the snow- 
white den. “I like being depressed. 
Leave me alone.” 

“Dr. Wu left strict programming 
instructions for me, Ozzie. You 
should try to get some rest. Why not 
lie down for a little while? It’s 
late." 

"I have work to do. Go away.” 

Oz reached for the slim brush 
that contained the murky red-black 
pigment cartridge. It had taken him 
hours to prepare the proper shading 
mix. Delicately holding the tubular 
brush between his middle finger, 
index finger and thumb, he leaned 
toward the easel. 

A filament-thin spray of color 
like coagulated blood jetted from 
the nozzle. It penetrated the surface 
of the painting, injecting into the 
very edge of a wrinkled rose petal. 

As Oz slowly turned the brush, 
the wafer-like spray twisted in the 
painting like a mobius strip and the 
rose petal almost seemed to move. 
He shut off the spray and surveyed 
the results, peering anxiously at the 
flower. There was a look of infinite 
sadness in his eyes. 

“It’s not right at all. I’ll never 

get it.” 

“Of course you will, Ozzie. You 
must have patience. You’re doing 
fine. Rest now.” 

‘‘No, I’m not doing fine! I know 
what it’s supposed to look like. I 
can see it in my mind. God, why 
can’t I get it out?” 

“Ozzie, you’re pushing yourself 
too hard. Why not let it go for 
now ? ” 

‘‘I can’t let it go! It could be so 
beautiful,” he said wistfully. ‘‘It 



just needs work, that’s all. It just 
needs work.” 

He rubbed his eyes. He could 
barely keep them open. “I wish I 
could stop. I wish with all my heart 
that I could stop.” 

There was a knock at the dor. 

“Oz? Are you awake? It’s Eric. 
Can I come in?” 

“Just a minute.” He covered the 
easel. “Come on in,” he replied 
wearily. 

The door slid open and Beldone 
entered. He took in the cadaverous 
whiteness of the den. “Cheery. It 
looks like a padded cell.” 

“I’ll change it if you like.” 

“No, no, don’t bother.” He sat 
down and looked at the covered 
easel. “How’s it coming?” 

Oz shook his head slowly from 
side to side with an air of resigna- 
tion. “I don’t know why I go on. It 
breaks my heart that I can’t create 
the beauty that I see inside myself. 
A painter is supposed to paint what 
he sees. He’s supposed to give life 
to his inner vision.” He gestured at 
the easel. “My child is stillborn. 
No life. No depth. No meaning. No 
spirit.” 

“You still won’t let me see it?” 

Oz did not answer. He stood up 
and turned the easel to the wall. He 
leaned on it, head bowed. Then, 
without turning around, he spoke in 
a muffled voice. 

“This Institute was my last re- 
sort. I have no more money. You 
know, Eric, I tried to kill myself a 
few months ago.” He turned and 
faced the writer. “Are you 
shocked?” 

Beldone met his gaze. “No. I’ve 
had that thought myself on occa- 
sion. It seems like the easy way out 



WRITER'S BLOCK

sometimes — ” he paused, “ — when 
the words won’t come. That was 
Sartre’s most profound regret before 
he died. That the words wouldn’t 
come. Dying didn’t bother him but 
he hated to leave the words be- 
hind.” 

“How can you stand it?” 

“I didn’t say that I could. You 
know, Oz, Raphael once said some- 
thing about how artists are the 
whores of the world. He meant that 
it’s a terrible thing to have to hinge 
your entire life on the whims of 
your patrons, but it goes much 
deeper than that. 

“We sell ourselves, pieces of our 
souls, because as painful as it some- 
times can be, the joy of completion 
makes it all somehow bearable. The 
orgasmic ecstasy that results from 
the creation of something undeni- 
ably yours is its own justification. 

“If life is pain, can art, which re- 
flects life, be different? I don’t 
know. I can’t describe what it is 
that drives people like us to put 
ourselves through hell just to write 
a story or paint a lunarscape or 
create an ephemeral presence in a 
psychorama. It’s a need of some 
sort, not many people have it. 
Perhaps they’re better off not hav- 
ing it. 

“But you and I are stuck. We do 
things that most people can’t do. 
We create something we love and 
we sell it and we ask others to love 
it. Sometimes they do, sometimes 
they don’t. When they don’t, it can 
be hard. Unendurably hard. 

“Yet we do it anyway. Masochis- 
tic? Yes, I suppose we all have a 
little of that in our psych profiles. 
Every one of us is his own little 
ambulatory corporation of neuroses. 



Otherwise we wouldn’t be here. 

“People like Rosswell, you, my- 
self,” he waved a hand, “so crave 
approval that we go to lengths to 
institutionalize ourselves so that we 
can get that drive flowing consis- 
tently enough to be able to offer 
ourselves up for sacrifice time and 
time again. 

“Oz,” said Beldone, taking the 
younger man by the shoulders, 
“you don’t have to kill yourself. 
You do that every time you sit 
down to paint. There!” He pointed 
at the easel. “There is your rebirth. 
Survive, Oz. Any way you can, 
survive ! Nothing else matters.” 

In all the world, no sparkle is 
brighter than the glisten of a tear. 

“No.” The writer stayed the art- 
ist’s hand. “No, Oz, don’t wipe it 
away. Paint with it.” 

He gave the younger man a hug 
and then he left. 

Dr. Wu had left strict, pro- 
grammed instructions that his pa- 
tient was to rest. A mild sedation 
was prescribed. One that would 
coax and coddle into sleep. But 
sleep, for some, is just a way of 
wasting time. The artist had to 
paint. 

For hour after hour Oz fought the 
gentle waves. The leaves took form, 
the thorns; the bloody flowers 
bowed their blooms in vivid 
splendor — incarnadine and carmine, 
a pulpy flush of damask and vermil- 
ion. And when the last brush clat- 
tered to the floor, the den went dim 
and Oz succumbed and slept. 

An intern, tired and bleary-eyed, 
paid scant attention to the screens. 
If he had watched, there might have 
been a human hesitation. But as it 
was, the program ran on schedule. 



82 



GALAXY 




Having given birth, that night the 
painter died. 

* * * 

“You asked to see me?” 

“Yes. To talk.” A pause. The 
room was mirrored. Beldone’s 
image was reflected from all angles 
in the den. The patient and his doc- 
tor could be seen from every view. 
“You like?” He made a sweeping 
gesture. “I set it up this way so I 
could see the many facets of my- 
self.” He thought of what he said 
to Oz the other night. “I see myself 
surrounded by hypocrisy.” 

Anne Cleaver wore a practiced 
look of nonchalance. She knew the 
answers and had known them for 
two days. The clues had been there 
all the time. He yearned for words 
but blocked them when they strug- 
gled to break free; she sought the 
clues but would not see them when 
they shouted to be seen. 

“I had a dream last night,” Bel- 
done began. “And in this dream 1 
had written my life’s masterpiece.” 
He paused. “It didn’t sell.” 

“Eric?” Oz entered, stopped. 
“Oh, I’m sorry. .” 

'‘Come in, Oz.” The writer 
smiled. “I was merely unburdening 
some guilt. What’s that you have 
there? Is it what I hope it is?” 
Starkovski shrugged. “My so- 
called painting. I thought you might 
like to have it as a souvenir. I’m 
going home. I can’t afford this 
elaborate therapy any more. In fact, 
I can’t afford anything any more. 
Ah, well. .I’ll survive. The main 
thing is that I won’t be killing my- 
self with this artistic delusion I’ve 
been under. Never again. But that’s 



all behind me. God, I haven’t felt 
this good in I don’t know how long! 
Like I haven’t a care in the world. 
So you see? I’m cured.” 

Anne suddenly went cold. She 
should have warned him. Beldone 
was not taking it well. In a daze, he 
took the painting. 

“So. There you are,” Oz went 
on. “Eric, I feel uncomfortable 
with drawn-out farewells. There 
doesn’t seem to be enough to say. I 
won’t forget you.” 

“Oz, I — ” but the painter was 
gone. “I won’t forget you either,” 
he finished weakly. “Something is 
terribly, terribly wrong. I have to 
stop him, Anne. I must — ” 

“It’s too late. There’s nothing 
you can do.” 

“Why?” Beldone looked lost. 
“What happened? I don’t under- 
stand. What have you done to 
him?” 

“His inability to function in his 
chosen medium was causing Oz un- 
bearable psychic distress. As you 
yourself observed, he was a ripe 
candidate for a breakdown,” she 
said calmly, trying to maintain a de- 
tached professional manner. “Espe- 
cially in view of the fact that he 
could not afford extended treatment 
and that even if he could, artistic 
breakthrough was not projected with 
any reasonable degree of probabil- 
ity.” 

Beldone went pale. “My God! 
You’ve killed him!” 

She smiled. “You’re being 
melodramatic. All right. If you will, 
what we have done is to administer 
a sort of ‘creative euthanasia.’ His 
inability to accomplish his desire 
was causing him a great deal of 
pain. We removed the desire. Under 



WRITER'S BLOCK

the circumstances, it was the kind- 
est thing to do.” 

His hands shook as he thrust the 
painting at her. "Look! Damn you, 
look'." 

In his last hours as an artist Oz 
had achieved perfection: three with- 
ered, bleeding roses in a patch of 
barren ground; a sun, extinguished; 
a broken thorn. A child’s vision of 
a demon’s dream. 

The silence screamed so loudly 
that she had to break it, yet her 
voice came slow. “H-how were we 
to know?” 

The writer stared. “He’ll paint 
again.” 



She shook her head. “He can't. 
We—” 

“I know he’ll paint again.” And, 
quietly, he mumbled, “Dum spiro, 
spero. There are no words for what 
has happened here. There are no 
words for what that boy has done.” 
His hand reached out and touched 
the roses. “There simply are no 
words.” 

He walked across the den, con- 
fronting the transcriber. He held his 
hand out and it hummed to life. He 
looked at Anne. 

“I’ll find the words,” he said. 
“I’ll find them!” 

And he began to write. ★

RAPPING OUT THE 
SPACE INDUSTRIES 



Last week I went to a conference 
and for three days I listened to dis- 
cussions of man’s first contact with 
aliens; how to construct farms on 
asteroids; manufacturing processes 
in space; interior decorating in large 
space structures; and other such 
far-out subjects. It might have been 
a science-fiction convention— except 
that it wasn’t. It was a meeting of 
the American Astronautical Society 
and the participants were engineers 
and scientists. 

The only science-fiction writers 
besides myself were Joe Haldeman 
and G. Harry Stine — and Harry was 
there as a session chairman, in his 



capacity as ' an engineer-scientist, 
not as a fictioneer. No longer are 
we addicts of this Buck Rogers 
Stuff the chief laborers in the space 
vineyards. 

It was an exciting week — at one 
point, while listening to a paper on 
asteroid colonies, Joe Haldeman and 
I turned toward each other and each 
began to say, “There’s a novel in 
this paper alone!” after which we 
both collapsed into laughter when 
we realized we were talking about 
the same idea. 

Obviously a conference like that 
is worth a column — but first, a 
commercial. 



86 



GALAXY 



I get letters. I get too many let- 
ters. I try to answer them all but I 
simply can’t; and certainly I can’t 
possibly carry on a lengthy corres- 
pondence, not even with those 
people I’d very much like to trade 
ideas with; nor can I send people 
copies of my data sources and bib- 
liographies, or do term papers for 
students, or write lengthy essays 
“giving more details” on subjects 
I’ve touched on in these columns. 

Thus two suggestions: First, if you 
enclose a self-addressed, stamped 
envelope, there’s a better chance I’ll 
be able to send some kind of 
reply — although I can’t promise to 
answer every letter, even when ac- 
companied by an sase . 

Second, if you want to talk with 
me about this Buck Rogers Stuff, 
catch me at a science-fiction con- 
vention. True, even that turns out to 
be difficult because there’s so much 
going on at cons, so a final idea: 
Los Angeles is bidding for the 
World Science Fiction Convention 
in 1981 . The Committee (of which I 
am a member) has decided that if 
we win the bid, we will put on a 
science fact symposium in which in- 
terested convention attendees will 
be able to discuss matters far-out 
with not only myself and other 
writers but also with a number of 
engineers and scientists working in 
the space sciences. Unlike many sf 
convention programs, this is in- 
tended to be a lengthy session with 
no automatic cut-off time, leaving 
plenty of opportunity for fanatics to 
get together. 

If that appeals to you, send a dol- 
lar to: Los Angeles In ’81 Commit- 
tee, 734 South Ardmore, Los 
Angeles, California 90005. That 



buys you a membership in the LA 
in ’81 Booster Club and you’ll then 
be told what you can do to bring 
this about. Now back to our regu- 
larly scheduled program. 

★ ★ ★ 

The AAS conference theme was 
“The Industrialization of Space — 
Planning for Profit at the High 
Frontier,” and there were literally 
dozens of papers presented. Some 
were the usual bushwah by an- 
thropologists and other social “sci- 
entists” who ought to have read 
some science fiction before redis- 
covering the wheel, but most were 
hard engineering studies: not 

whether we should go to space, but 
specifically how to get there and 
what to do upon arrival. Costs and 
schedules; modular building blocks; 
assembly of large structures; com- 
mercial products and optimum 
methods of making them; inter- 
mediate technology studies of road- 
block or “show-stopper” problems 
and what to do about them — that 
sort of thing. 

There were even a number of de- 
cent papers in the “soft science” 
areas. One NASA study on space- 
management techniques is a gold 
mine of information because rather 
than having a couple of an- 
thropologists sit in a semi-dark 
room and dictate great thoughts, 
James Ragusa of the Payload Inte- 
gration Office in NASA’s Shuttle 
Project actually examined compar- 
able situations for similarities to 
the space-management environment. 
His group found that the ten most 
similar situations to a space base 
were, in descending order of simi-

From these they could identify 
personnel and management prob- 
lems, examine over fifty possible 
organizational structures ranging 
from the traditional military to 
“participatory democracy,” and 
come up with some preliminary 
work on management organizations 
appropriate to various space situa- 
tions. Nobody thinks they have any 
final answers, but this was a sound 
study with identifiable criteria and 
variables. 

Incidentally, they also examined 
the management structure of Star 
Trek and found it wanting. In fact, 
my major criticism of Ragusa’s 
study is that NASA apparently 
thinks science fiction begins and 
ends with Buck Rogers and Star 
Trek, and the management study 
team has evidently never read any 
of the really serious science-fiction 
works that address themselves to the 
social environment of man in space. 
To be fair to NASA, they have 
probably made a far more thorough 
study of the relevant historical 



examples than has any sf author; 
but it does seem that a successful 
science-fiction writer may have at 
least as much chance of contributing 
a meaningful input as does a 
graduate student in anthropology. 

(Lest it be said that I’m unduly 
harsh on anthropologists, let me 
quicky add that I’m certain their 
profession can make a contribution, 
but I do grow weary of speculative 
papers on human behavior in high- 
stress situations written by people 
who have obviously never read the 
diaries of polar explorers or the logs 
of research ships.) 

The US approach to space explo- 
ration was one of building blocks; 
this was established by the Apollo 
program {Mercury, Gemini, Apollo 
and Skylab followed logically one 
on the next) and it’s likely that this 
approach will continue. Given that: 
assumption, what might we expect 
to see in the year 2000 in the way 
of space operations? One can only 
guess, of course; but one of the best 
guesses — in the sense that it is 
based on the building-block logic — 
is shown in Table One. 

Now Table One is not supposed 
to be carved in granite; it’s merely 
an estimate of what we could have 
by the year 2000. No one really 
knows what we will be doing — in 
fact, if we merely project present 
trends in US R&D efforts, the best 
guess is that by 2000 we’ll be doing 
very little — but at least we have a 
starting point for discussion. 

So what will all those people be 
doing in space?

space development that we know number of advantages: It is clean; it 
reasonably well: materials that can provides power at low operating 
be made only in space (or can be costs (after the enormous initial cap- 
made there far more economically ital investment); the fuel costs are 
than here on Earth); and space- nil and the fuel source is perpetual, 
based solar power facilities. Of SPS is a high-technology indus- 
these, the Solar Power Satellite try, meaning that the US has a very 
(SPS) concept has captured the most good edge in international competi- 
public attention. SPS offers a tion; the need for energy is unlikely 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



89 





to vanish in the near future; and 
energy and food exports make ex- 
cellent sense for US international 
trade. 

Moreover, nearly everyone is 
agreed that someday we’ll have to 
use solar power; and a space-based 
system has many advantages over 
an Earth-based solar collector. Out 
in space there’s no day-night cycle 
or cloudy weather. Solar power col- 
lectors have to be large — the solar 
constant of one kiloWatt per square 
meter is an absolute limit, so if you 
want a thousand-megaWa’tt facility 
(comparable to today’s better coal- 
fired plants), you’ll need at least a 
million square meters of surface 
area; and it’s very much easier to 
build large structures in space than 
it is here on Earth. Down here you 
have both gravity and wind to con- 
tend with. Up there you have 
neither. 

Thus the SPS concept is simple 
enough. A large collecting surface 
is deployed in space. The incident 
sunlight is converted to electricity, 
either directly by solar panels or by 
using mirrors to concentrate heat 
and then running a working fluid 
through a turbine. (Both concepts 
are under study. The turbines are 
not easy to build and operate in 
space, but they are at the moment 
far more efficient than solar panels; 
thus there’s a trade-off between the 
simplicity of a direct-conversion 
system with a much larger surface 
area, or a smaller but more complex 
turbine system.) However the power 
is generated, it is then converted to 
microwaves of the proper frequency 
and beamed down to Earth. 

The Earth-based part is a large 
antenna farm. The antenna elements 



are raised above ground, and the 
energy density in the system is low 
enough that cattle can graze on the 
land below, although no human in 
his right mind would want to live 
there. If birds wander into the 
beam, they grow warm and presum- 
ably will fly away. The beam den- 
sity isn’t enough to harm aircraft 
that stray into the system; and if the 
beam gets off center from the an- 
tenna farm, it shuts itself off 
through a rather simple control sys- 
tem. 

Nearly all the waste heat from the 
system is left in space and what the 
SPS sends down to Earth is, or can 
be, sunlight that would have come 
to Earth anyway — thus the over-all 
heat balance of the Sun-Earth sys- 
tem is not changed. 

That’s the concept, which is — it’s 
humorous that I can say this, but 
it’s true — simple enough. Can we 
build it? 

Surely. We know far more about 
the technology problems of SPS 
than we did about going to the 
Moon when John Kennedy gave us 
that task. 

Is it economical? 

That depends partly on one’s def- 
inition of “economical.” Certainly 
you will not get power from SPS to 
compete with $10-a-barrel oil. What 
we have to pay in international 
problems to keep oil at $ 1 0/bbl is 
something else again — and will oil 
stay at that price anyway? In the 
very long run we must have solar 
power because there just isn’t that 
much oil left at any price; so the 
economic question is one of time as 
much as anything else. 

Manufacture of materials in space 
is in much the same situation as 



90 



GALAXY 




SPS: We know what the problems 
are, and we know how to go about 
doing the job; we don’t really know 
the costs or the profits to be made. 

At the AAS meeting there were 
some first cuts made at answering 
these questions. Representative 
materials such as organics (uro- 
kinase in the example), films 
(silicon ribbons) and alloys (high- 
coercive strength magnets) were 
analyzed for market potential, prob- 
able sales price, cost of manufac- 
ture on Earth and cost of manufac- 
ture in space. The one discussed at 
the meeting was magnets, in which 
it was assumed that there was a 
market potential of 0.5% (¥i a per 
cent) of the present purchases for 
very efficient magnets selling at 
$1500 a kilogram, a price some 
users already pay. 

Now this type of analysis requires 
a lot of assumptions about costs- 
to-orbit, what facilities might be 
available in orbit, where raw mate- 
rials might be found (if they can be 
mined on the Moon, the profits can 
increase; but there’s not enough 
market potential to set up a Moon 
Base if that’s all you mine, so how 
much of the “overhead” of a Moon 
Base must be charged to this par- 
ticular operation?), and the like. 
The overall conclusion was that this 
space operation could be profitable 
with a return of about 13% on in- 
vestment; not bad, but also not a 
very firm number. 

You get similar results if you 
analyze other space processes. The 
“profits” are just too dependent on 
the numbers you assume. We don’t 
know enough about the space envi- 
ronment and the costs of getting 
there.

Note, though, that there are alter- 
nate routes. A German private- 
investment group known as OT- 
RAG has recently flown the basic 
module of their proposed privately 
owned satellite-launching company, 
and they fully expect to be able to 
put payload in orbit by 1981 at 
costs that they say will be 
“market-oriented,” which is to say 
at costs competitive with NASA’s 
subsidized Shuttle. The OTRAG 
system will never be man-rated and 
is intended to be a routine “com- 
mon carrier” for space packages: 
communications satellites, of 
course, but also a capability to send 
up raw materials for manufacturing 
in space, and fuel to bring down 
finished space products. 

This is what leaves economic 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

analyses of space operations in a 
confused state — but it is also why 
the whole field is so exciting. Con- 
sider: If there are space manufactur- 
ing operations that may be profita- 
ble by themselves, they are almost 
certainly going to be profitable in 
company with others. If the Solar 
Power Satellites are built, there will 
be sizeable communities of people 
in space. Many of the life-support 
problems will be solved. It doesn’t 
cost much to add a manufacturing 
module to a space power station — 
that is, not much compared to the 
price of putting up the first station. 

If you have a Moon Base to mine 
materials for the SPS, the addition 
of a capability to mine other miner- 
als up there, where the gravity costs 
are so much less (it takes only a 
fraction of the fuel to get from 
Lunar surface to Lunar orbit as 
compared to going from Earth to 
Earth orbit), will not be prohibi- 
tively expensive. 

Moreover, there’s a very good 
chance that all the oxygen required 
for space operations can come from 
the Moon. At the A AS meeting. 
Professor G. K. O’Neill, the 
Princeton physics professor of 
O’Neill Colony fame, showed 
movies of a working model of his 
mass-driver — a device that might be 
used to launch Lunar materials into 
Lunar orbit without using rockets at 
all. The concept is old to science 
fiction, of course: electric sleds that 
go across the Lunar surface fast 
enough to give their payloads Lunar 
escape velocity; but it’s not ours 
alone any more. The engineers are 
hard at work designing them and 
building test models. 

With a working Moon Base and a 



working mass-driver on the Moon, 
a number of space operations are 
dearly profitable. 

With a working Solar Power 
Satellite, manufacturing is profita- 
ble. If manufacturing operations in 
space become routine, the SPS con- 
cept comes closer to being competi- 
tive with present-day power genera- 
tion. 

Meanwhile, one group of 
economists has identified $673 bil- 
lion in spinoff benefits from past 
space activities. This includes 
twenty new services; 150 new pro- 
ducts; 100 new processes; and 35 
product upgradings. It does not in- 
clude incalculables such as Earth- 
watch pollution monitoring. Very 
few of these benefits were expected 
when space research began. Most 
weren’t even dreamed of. 

You could easily say that NASA 
was one of the few — perhaps the 
only — successes of the US govern- 
ment in the past twenty years, and 
at no time did space’s share exceed 
2% of the government’s overall 
budget. (For that matter, ask anyone 
when was the last time he felt truly 
proud of the United States and the 
likelihood is high that he’ll say July 
20, 1969. “Tranquility Base here. 
The Eagle has landed.”) 

* * * 

Which brings us to another part 
of the AAS discussion: What, if 
anything, is government’s proper 
role in space development? Speak- 
ers advocated everything from total 
abandonment by government to the 
creation of a Space Exploitation Au- 
thority along the lines of TVA. 

The anti-govemment hardliners 



92 



GALAXY 




have two points: Government is in- 
efficient and will waste the money; 
or space development will make 
government so powerful that we’ll 
never escape its snares. Certainly 
we all of us have misgivings about 
increasing government power, and 
anything that sends more money 
flowing through Washington creates 
new layers of bureaucracy; but one 
wonders how we’ll ever get to 
Table One without government ac- 
tivity. 

After all, the most violent advo- 
cates of NASA space research aren’t 
asking for more than the 2% the 
space budget had back in Apollo 
days. It’s not really much money 
compared to HEW or Defense, and 
if we can all agree that the Federal 
budget ought to be cut, surely 
there’s room for the cuts in pro- 
grams that don’t have so many ob- 
vious benefits? It isn’t as though the 
money is likely to be left in the hands 
of taxpayers if it’s not spent on 
space. 

Then too, Adam Smith, hardly an 
advocate of the Welfare State, said 
that there are some enterprises 
which are so expensive and have so 
many benefits to the general good 
(without much chance of profit for 
individual investors) that they are 
the proper activity of the central 
government. He was thinking of 
projects such as harbors and canals 
but I doubt he would have disap- 
proved of the voyages of HMS Bea- 
gle or Challenger. 

Exploration by US teams: Lewis 
and Clark, Zebulon Pike, Fremont, 
polar exploration teams, the Hy- 
drographic and Geographic bureaus 
and the like — all these are old tradi- 
tions in this country. Their benefits 



are pretty obvious; and providing 
access to space, developing basic 
technology, answering some of the 
unknown questions that keep us 
from making good profit-risk esti- 
mates about space operations — these 
seem to me to be very proper ac- 
tivities for Washington to under- 
take. More proper, in fact, than 
many of the things the federal 
government does “for us” now. 

I realize this is an open question 
worth a lot more discussion. The 
opening of the “high frontier” 
could be the most important activ- 
ity, excluding religion, in the his- 
tory of mankind. How we go about 
it can hardly be trivial. On the other 
hand, if we don’t do it at all — and 
it looks as though we can’t without 
considerably more early develop- 
ment work than profit-making com- 
panies will undertake — the loss may 
then be the most important event in 
our history. 

The problem with private invest- 
ment in space is that right now the 
front-end costs are very high and 
the return is not really predictable. I 
can have faith that the spinoff 
technologies will be valuable, but I 
can’t guarantee they’ll be valuable 
to those who invest the money. A 
magnet-manufacturing firm just isn’t 
equipped to make profits from new 
management techniques, more effi- 
cient use of electrical power, better 
vacuum seals, higher yields from 
algae farms or many of the totally 
unexpected benefits space develop- 
ment may not merely give us but 
require as a condition for getting 
out there. 

Or take Earth-observation satel- 
lites as an example. One of their 
major benefits was in the hundred 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



93 




of billions we did not have to spend 
on weapons: Through the use of ob- 
servation satellites we were able to 
obtain much better intelligence es- 
timates of Soviet strategic strength 
than we could have otherwise, and 
thus we did not have to construct 
weapons to counter possible threats. 
How can any private firm profit 
from that? (Oh, sure, private com- 
panies, as well as each of us, pro- 
fited from the lower taxes; but such 
general-good benefits can hardly be 
financed through private contribu- 
tions, not in this real world we live 
in.) 

Lest this paper become one of 
those rambling essays rediscovering 
the wheel, let’s leave the subject. 
It’s one I’ll be glad to discuss in 
person at, say, the Los Angeles in 
‘81 Convention. 

★ * * 

There was at the AAS meeting 
a small contingent of the opposi- 
tion. “Environmentalists,” various 
“concerned” groups, some of 
whom say flatly that “humanity 
hasn’t earned the right to go to 
space”; others who are frankly and 
openly against the whole idea of 
“progress” and want us to use our 
energies in “appropriate technol- 
ogy” or want the world to have 
universally and equally shared pov- 
erty rather than differentials be- 
tween wealthy and poor nations. 

Dr. Philomena Grddzka of the 
Lockheed Missiles and Space Com- 
pany gave what I thought was the 
best reply of the symposium when 
she observed that in her view, the 
appropriate-technology people were 
in effect “trying to preserve as 

94 



many mind-stultifying jobs as pos- 
sible,” and that world society, 
given the growth of bureaucracy 
and unions and large organizations, 
was “far more in danger of creep- 
ing feudalism than of any new 
technology.” 

There were others, though, who 
had more cogent objections to space 
industries. Their motivations are 
similar to those of the first group 
but at least their opposition is ex- 
pressed in technical, rather than 
poetic, terms. For example, they 
say that we cannot have a closed- 
system ecology in space; we don’t 
even know enough about ecology 
on Earth to set one up here. How, 
then, are we to have complete re- 
cycling in space colonies and Moon 
Bases? 

As I said above, many of those 
objections come from groups which 
obviously do not want the answers 
to their questions: They ask to 
taunt, not for information. Still, an- 
swers are coming forth’. 

The single most exciting paper in 
the symposium, according to both 
Joe Haldeman and myself, was 
“Use of Outer Planet Satellites 
and Asteroids as Sources of Raw 
Materials for Life-Support Systems,” 
by Peter M. Mol ton and Ted E. 
Devine, both of Batelle North- 
west Laboratories in Richland, 
Washington. 

This paper analyzed requirements 
for large space operations. It 
examined the costs of supplying 
space-manufacturing facilities from 
Earth and concluded the obvious: 
We can’t afford to ship up all that 
food and water for “once-through” 
use. 

They then looked realistically at 
GALAXY 




recycling and concluded that we 
don’t yet know how to manage that 
with sufficient efficiency. They 
examined what’s likely to be avail- 
able on the Moon, and from best 
evidence, there’s simply not enough 
carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen 
for self-sufficiency; certainly not 
enough to supply an expanding in- 
dustrial base. 

Given the realities of rocket 
transport, simply going out to the 
asteroid belt — where it is quite 
likely that the missing elements are 
found in abundance — won’t do the 
job either. The two-way transport 
costs are too high. Therefore, out in 
the asteroid belt there will have to 
be facilities not only for mining and 
refining compounds vital to the space 
and Lunar bases, but also for man- 
ufacturing the rocket fuels to get 
these materials from the belt to 
Earth orbit. 

This is possible but it requires 
relatively permanent asteroid 
stations — and those must be 
supplied with food and water. Can 
we farm the asteroids for self- 
sufficiency? 

Molton and Devine then pro- 
ceeded to design an asteroid farm. 
It consists of a big mirror shaped 
something like a saucer. By big 
they don’t mean enormous — only 
about 80 meters in radius. On top 
of this sits a cup-shaped dome about 
36 meters in radius, having as a cap 
an overhead reflector. Various sup- 
port systems for the planets — even 
on Ceres the gravity is only about 
4% that of the Earth’s — were 
examined. Tests were made. The 
costs of transporting various soil 
enrichments, trace elements, fer- 
tilizers, etc., from Earth to the 



Ceres base for use in the “farms” 
were considered. 

The whole system was then 
analyzed in terms of costs and bene- 
fits to near-Earth space activities, 
building up this picture of the fu- 
ture: 

Earth exports information, enter- 
tainment and the like, with some 
very high-value material exports. In 
return. Earth receives an almost un- 
limited supply of rare metals, min- 
erals and space-processed, high-cost 
products. 

The Lunar Base does support the 
near-Earth satellites (it takes less 
fuel, and therefore costs less, to go 
from the Moon-to-Earth orbit than 
from Earth-to-Earth orbit), export- 
ing some finished products, raw 
materials and oxygen. The Moon 
Base is also the main support 
supply-line for an asteroid colony. 
The asteroid bases import oxygen 
and support technology from the 
Moon. It is even possible that many 
of the personnel in the asteroid sys- 
tem are actually permanent residents 
on the Moon, taking a ten-year tour 
of duty out in the belt. The asteroid 
bases export kerogen (carbonaceous 
chrondritic material containing car- 
bon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxy- 
gen, and known to good probability 
to be relatively plentiful in the as- 
teroid belt). 

One can even see the sources of 
future conflict here: The asteroid 
bases have everything the Moon 
colony does, plus kerogens. All 
they lack are quick access to the 
satellite facilities near Earth and the 
more intense solar energy at Earth 
orbit. A tendency to want indepen- 
dence is predictable. 

There’s a lot more in this paper,

all hard data. No, of course 
Molton and Devine haven’t “solv- 
ed” all the problems of making 
space colonies self-sufficient, nor 
do they claim to have. They have 
shown one possible route and dem- 
onstrated that with some reasonable 
assumptions about the value of 
space-processed materials, the whole 
operation can be profitable: Earth 
puts up the money for the initial 
development and obtains an un- 
limited supply of rare metals and 
such in return. 

There were other such papers, 
and the contrast between the careful 
work of the engineers and 
scientists — showing their assump- 
tions, stating the unknowns in their 
work and getting their math right — 
the contrast between them and the 
opponents of the space program 
couldn’t be greater. 

Example: My one-time debate 
opponent, John Holt: “If L-5 is a 
point where the gravitational fields 
of earth and moon cancel each other 
out, any movement toward one 
would lead it to further movement 
in that direction, there being no cor- 
recting or opposing force ... it 
would be hard for those on earth- 
when it (the space colony) did get 
there.” A neat demonstration of ig- 
norance of high-school physics. 

Or the biologist who “proves” 
that “the people who can conceive 
of this clever solution (space col- 
onies) cannot be part of it” and that 
those who will go to space won’t be 
smart enough to live there; thus, he 
says, he has shown us “the work- 
ings of a Reductio ad Paradoxium — 
let’s call it RAP for short . RAP 
overrides all other approaches 
. O’Neill’s colonies run right up 



against a political rap-out. There 
is no need to look further into tech- 
nical feasibility once we understand 
the political rap-out.” And he is — I 
am not joking — quite incensed that 
we would waste any more time on 
studying the technology of space 
since he has proved that space col- 
onies are “rapped out.” 

Silly . and yet not too differ- 
ent from the acts of faith which we 
in science fiction professed in the 
early days. On faith and imagina- 
tion we worked toward a goal that 
most of us didn’t really understand 
and toward which only a few could 
make any direct technical contribu- 
tion. 

Part of our job in the old days 
was answering the silly arguments 
of those of opposing faith; was 
keeping the flame burning while 
others went out and gathered hard 
data. 

That time has come. The data are 
flowing in and the hard analysis be- 
gins. We can make use of much of 
that. It happens that I am at this 
moment expanding and revising a 
story of an asteroid colony (Bind 
Your Sons to Exile, a short version 
of which appeared in a now-defunct 
magazine) that will be published by 
Ace next fall — with forty interior il- 
lustrations by a major artist yet! If 
you think you recognize in that 
book some of the concepts I got 
from Molton and Devine, you’ll be 
quite correct. 

The scientists are doing the de- 
signs for us. 

When it comes to space indus- 
trialization and near-term space 
technology, we science-fiction writ- 
ers have to make a readjustment. 

It’s not ours alone any more. ★

Dad came and went. He returned 
to Amber long enough to provide 
instructions concerning the coming 
conflict with the Courts of Chaos, 
and then he rode off again. 

In a strange reenactment of my 
most recent experiences in Tir-na 
Nog’th, Benedict and Dara were 
summoned to the throne room by 
Martin. There, Benedict lost his 
new arm to a ghostly me, just as 
the ghostly Benedict had lost it to 
the real me in the city in the sky. 

Martin had summoned Dara by 
means of a Trump the like of which 
I had never before seen. I learned 
that morning that his set had been 
made by Merlin— my son by 
Dara — of whose existence I had not 
been aware. 

While I was still reeling from this 
knowledge Dara began giving or- 
ders in Dad’s name, producing his 
signet to back them up. This was 
too much. I got in touch with Fiona 
at the place of the primal Pattern, 
where I’d guessed Dad might have 
gone. I was right. He was there. I 
learned from Fiona that he was 
about to risk his life in an attempt 
to repair the Pattern. 

I had Fi trump me through. I 
seized the Jewel of Judgment from 
Dad and was set to try repairing 
the Pattern myself when he and 
Dworkin were able to stop me. Dad 
had a talk with me then. He had 
decided, he told me, that he wanted 
me to be his successor, with Dara 
as my queen. 

I made what I think was one of 
my wiser decisions and turned him 
down. He sent me back to Amber 
then, with instructions to prepare 
for a long journey and await his 
presence outside the city. 



I did this, and he got in touch 
with me later — creating a red bird 
from my blood to bear me the Jewel 
when he was finished with it. Then 
he bade me ride for the Courts of 
Chaos. I rode as I had never ridden 
before, and the bird did finally 
bring me the Jewel. By this, I knew 
that Dad had finished his attempt to 
repair the Pattern and might well 
be dead. Also, he might well have 
failed, in which case the very fabric 
of existence was being unraveled 
slowly at my back. 

With these cheerful thoughts, I 
continued through Shadow toward 
the Courts of Chaos, encountering 
my brother Brand, who tried to 
force me to give him the Jewel on 
our first meeting and tried to talk 
me out of it on our second. Neither 
effort succeeded. 

Then Brand ambushed me, slay- 
ing Star, my mount. He almost 
nailed me, too, but was attacked by 
my red familiar bird and had to de- 
part. I continued on by foot, pass- 
ing through a strange valley which 
seemed to mark the end of all or- 
der. I haven’t decided yet whether 
the greatest pest in the place was a 
nihilistic bird who wanted to con- 
vert me or a jackal who only 
wanted to eat me. 

I survived both of them and made 
it to a plateau which I hoped lay 
near my goal. Alas, it did not. Then 
I did the only thing I saw left to do. 
Assuming the worst — that Dad had 
failed and all the Shadow was now 
being engulfed by waves of Chaos — I 
strove with my remaining strength 
to inscribe a new Pattern. 

I succeeded, too, only to have the 
Jewel snatched from me by Brand, 
who promptly vanished with it. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

As I LAY THERE HURTING, I had 
visions of Brand appearing on the 
battlefield where die forces of 
Amber and Chaos fought, Jewel 
pulsing about his neck. Apparently 
his control over it was sufficient, as 
he saw it, to enable him to turn 
things against us. I saw him lashing 
out with lightning bolts among our 
troops. I saw him summoning great 
winds and hailstorms to strike at us. 
I almost wept. All of this, when he 
could still redeem himself by com- 
ing in on our side. Just winning was 
not enough for him now, though. 
He had to win for himself, and on 
his own terms. And I? I had failed. 
I had thrown up a Pattern against 
the Chaos, a thing I had never 
thought I could do. Yet this would 
be as nothing if the battle was lost 
and Brand returned and wiped out 
my work. To have come this close, 
passing through everything that I 
had, and then to fail here ... it 
made me want to cry “Injustice!” 
though I knew the universe did not 
run in accordance with my notions 
of equity. I gnashed my teeth and 
spat some dirt I had mouthed. I had 
been charged by our father to take 
the Jewel to the place of battle. I 
had almost made it. 

A sense of strangeness came over 
me then. Something was calling for 
my attention. What? 

The silence. 

The raging winds and the thunder 
had ceased. The air was still. In 
fact, the air felt cool and fresh. And 
on the other side of my eyelids, I 
knew that there was light. 

I opened my eyes. I saw a sky of 
a bright, uniform white. I blinked, I 



turned my head. There was some- 
thing off to my right .... 

A tree. A tree stood where I had 
planted the staff I had cut from old 
Ygg. It was already far taller than 
the staff itself had been. I could al- 
most see it growing. And it was 
green with leaves and white with a 
sprinkling of buds; a few blossoms 
had opened. From that direction the 
breeze brought me a faint and deli- 
cate scent which offered me some 
comfort. 

I felt along my sides. I did not 
seem to have any broken ribs, 
though my guts still felt knotted 
from the kick I had taken. I rubbed 
my eyes with my knuckles and ran 
my hands through my hair. I sighed 
heavily then and rose to one knee. 

Turning my head, I regarded the 
prospect. The plateau was the same, 
yet somehow nyt the same. It was 
still bare but was no longer harsh. 
Likely an effect of the new illumi- 
nation. No, there was more to it 
than that .... 

I had continued to turn, complet- 
ing my scanning of the horizon. It 
was not the same place where I had 
commenced my walk. There were 
differences both subtle and gross: 
altered rock formations, a dip where 
there had been a rise, a new texture 
to the stone beneath and near me, in 
the distance what appeared to be 
soil. I stood and it seemed that 
now, from somewhere, I caught the 
scent of the sea. This place had an 
entirely different feeling to it than 
the one to which I had mounted — so 
long ago, it seemed. It was too 
much of a change for that storm to 
have wrought. It reminded me of 
something. 

I sighed again, there at the Pat- 



100 



GALAXY 




tern’s center, and continued to con- 
sider my surroundings. Somehow, 
in spite of myself, my despair was 
slipping away and a feeling of — 
“refreshment” seems somehow the 
best word — was rising within me. 
The air was so clean and sweet, and 
the place had a new, unused feeling 
about it. 1 — 

Of course. It was like the place 
of the primal Pattern. I turned back 
to the tree and regarded it again, 
higher already. Like, yet un- 
like .... There was something 
now in the air, the ground, the sky. 
This was a new place. A new pri- 
mal Pattern. Everything about me 
then was a result of the Pattern in 
which I stood. 

I suddenly realized that I was 
feeling more than refreshment. It 
was now a sense of elation, a kind 
of joy, that was moving through 
me. This was a clean, fresh place 
and I was somehow responsible for 
it. 

Time passed. I just stood there 
watching the trees, looking around 
me, enjoying the euphoria that had 
come over me. Here was some kind 
of victory, anyway — until Brand 
came back to wipe it out. 

Suddenly I was sober again. I 
had to stop Brand, I had to protect 
this place. I was at the center of a 
Pattern. If this one behaved like the 
other, I could use its power to pro- 
ject myself anywhere I desired. I 
could use it to go and join the 
others now. 

I dusted myself off. I loosened 
my blade in the scabbard. Things 
might not be as hopeless as they 
had seemed earlier. I had been told 
to convey the Jewel to the place of 
battle. So Brand had done it for me; 



it would still be there. I would sim- 
ply have to go and take it back 
from him, somehow, to make things 
tum the way they were supposed to 
have fallen. 

I looked all around me. I would 
have to return here, to investigate 
this new situation at another time, if 
I survived what was to come. There 
was mystery here. It hung in the air 
and drifted on the breeze. It could 
take ages to unravel what had oc- 
curred when I had drawn the new 
Pattern. 

I saluted the tree. It seemed to 
stir as I did so. I adjusted my rose 
and pushed it back into shape. It 
was time to move again. There was 
a thing I had yet to do. 

I lowered my head and closed my 
eyes. I tried to recall the lay of the 
land before the final abyss at the 
Courts of Chaos. I saw it then, be- 
neath that wild sky, and I peopled it 
with my relatives, with troops. I 
seemed to hear the sounds of a dis- 
tant battle as I did this. The scene 
adjusted itself, came clearer. I held 
the vision an instant longer, then 
charged the Pattern to take me 
there. 

... A moment later, it seemed, I 
stood upon a hilltop beside a plain, 
a cold wind whipping my cloak 
about me. The sky was that crazy, 
turning, stippled thing I remem- 
bered from last time — half-black, 
half psychedelic rainbows. There 
were unpleasant fumes in the air. 
The black road was off to the right 
now, crossing that plain and passing 
beyond it over the abyss toward that 
knighted citadel, firefly gleams 
flickering about it. Gauzy bridges 
drifted in the air, extending from 
afar in that darkness, and strange 



102

forms traveled upon them as well as 
upon the black road. Below me on 
the field was what seemed to be the 
main concentration of troops. At my 
back, I heard something other than 
Time’s winged chariot. 

Turning toward what must have 
been north by a succession of pre- 
vious reckonings regarding its 
course, I beheld the advance of that 
devil-storm through distant moun- 
tains, flashing and growling, com- 
ing on like a sky-high glacier. 

So I had not stopped it with the 
creation of a new Pattern. It seemed 
that it had simply passed by my 
protected area and would continue 
on until it got to wherever it was 
going. Hopefully then, the thing 
would be succeeded by whatever 
constructive impulses were now 
spreading outward from the new 
Pattern, with the reimposition of 



order throughout the places of 
Shadow. I wondered how long it 
would take for the storm to get 
here. 

I heard the sound of hoofs and 
turned, drawing my blade .... 

A homed rider on a great black 
horse was bearing down upon me, 
something like firelight glowing in 
his eyes. 

I adjusted my position and 
waited. He seemed to have de- 
scended from one of the gauzy 
roadways which had drifted in this 
direction. We were both fairly far 
removed from the main scene of ac- 
tion. I watched as he mounted the 
hill. Good horse, that. Nice chest. 
Where the hell was Brand? I wasn’t 
looking for just any fight. 

I watched the rider as he came 
on, the crooked blade in his right 
hand. I repositioned myself as he

moved in to cut me down. When he 
swung, I was ready with a parry 
that pulled his arm within reach. I 
caught hold of it and dragged him 
from his mount. 

“That rose ...” he said as he 
fell to the ground. I do not know 
what else he might have said be- 
cause I cut his throat, and his words 
and everything else about him were 
lost with the fiery slash. 

I whirled then, drawing Grays- 
wandir away, sprinted several paces 
and had hold of the black charger’s 
bridle. I spoke with the horse to 
calm him and led him away from 
the flames. After a couple of min- 
utes we were on better terms, and I 
mounted. 

He was skittish at first, but I just 
had him pace the hilltop lightly 
while I continued to observe. The 
forces of Amber appeared to be on 
the offense. Smouldering corpses 
were all over the field. The main 
force of our enemies was drawn 
back onto a height near the lip of 
the abyss. Lines of them, not yet 
broken but hard pressed, were fall- 
ing back slowly toward it. On the 
other hand, more troops were cross- 
ing that abyss and joining the others 
who held the heights. Estimating 
their growing numbers and their 
position quickly, I judged that these 
might be readying an offense of 
their own. Brand was nowhere in 
sight. 

Even if I had been rested and 
wearing armor, I would have had 
second thoughts about riding down 
and joining in the fray. My job 
right now was to locate Brand. I 
doubted that he would be directly 
involved in the fighting. I looked 
off to the sides of the battle proper, 



seeking a lone figure. No 
. perhaps the far side of the 
field. I would have to circle to the 
north. There was too much that I 
could not see to the west. 

I turned my mount and made my 
way down the hill. It would be so 
pleasant to collapse, I decided. Just 
to fall down in a heap and sleep. I 
sighed. Where the hell was Brand? 

I reached the bottom of the hill 
and turned to cut through a culvert. 
I needed a better view — 

“Lord Corwin of Amber!” 

He was waiting for me as 1 
rounded a bend in the depression, a 
big, corpse-colored guy with red 
hair and a horse to match. He wore 
coppery armor with greenish trac- 
ings, and he sat facing me, still as a 
statue. 

“I saw you on the hilltop,” he 
said. “You are not mailed, are 
you?” 

I slapped my chest. 

He nodded sharply. Then he 
reached up, first to his left shoul- 
der, then to his right, then to his 
sides, opening fastenings upon his 
breastplate. When he had them un- 
done, he removed it, lowered it to- 
ward the ground on his left side and 
let it fall. He did the same with his 
greaves. 

“I have long wanted to meet 
you,” he said. “I am Borel. I do 
not want it said that I took unfair 
advantage of you when I killed 
you.” 

Borel ... the name was familiar. 
Then I remembered. He had Dara’s 
respect and affection. He had been 
her fencing teacher, a master of the 
blade. Stupid, though, I saw. He 
had forfeited my respect by remov- 
ing his armor. Battle is not a game, 



104 



GALAXY 




and I had no desire to make myself 
available to any presumptuous ass 
who thought otherwise. Especially a 
skilled ass, when I was feeling beat. 
If nothing else, he could probably 
wear me down. 

“Now we shall resolve a matter 
which has long troubled me,” he 
said. 

I replied with a quaint vulgarism, 
wheeled my black and raced back 
the way I had come. He gave chase 
immediately. 

As I passed back along the cul- 
vert, 1 realized that 1 did not have a 
sufficient lead. He would be upon 
me in a matter of moments with my 
back all exposed, to cut me down 
or force me to fight. However, 
while limited, my choices included 
a little more than that. 

“Coward!” he cried. “You flee 
combat! Is this the great warrior of 
whom I have heard so much?” 

I reached up and unfastened my 
cloak. At either hand, the culvert’s 
lip was level with my shoulders, 
then my waist. 

I rolled out of the saddle to my 
left, stumbled once and found my 
footing. The black continued on. I 
moved to my right, facing the draw. 

Catching my cloak in both hands, 
I swung it in a reverse-veronica 
maneuver a second or two before 
Borel’s head and shoulders came 
abreast of me. It swept over him, 
drawn blade and all, muffling his 
head and slowing his arms. 

I kicked then, hard. I was aiming 
for his head, but I caught him on 
the left shoulder. He. was spilled 
from his saddle, and his horse, too, 
went by. 

Drawing Grayswandir, I leaped 
after him. I caught him just as he 



had brushed my cloak aside and 
was struggling to rise. I skewered 
him where he sat and saw the star- 
tled expression on his face as the 
wound began to flame. 

“Oh, basely done!” he cried. “I 
had hoped for better of thee!” 

“This isn’t exactly the Olympic 
Games,” I said, brushing some 
sparks from my cloak. 

I chased down my horse then and 
mounted. This took me several 
minutes. As I continued on north- 
ward, I achieved higher ground. 
From there I spotted Benedict di- 
recting the battle, and in a draw far 
to the rear, I caught a glimpse of 
Julian at the head of his troops from 
Arden. Benedict was apparently 
holding them in reserve. 

I kept going, toward the advanc- 
ing storm, beneath the half-dark, 
half-painted, revolving sky. I soon 
reached my goal, the highest hill in 
sight, and began to mount it. I 
halted several times on the way up, 
to look back. 

I saw Deirdre in black armor, 
swinging an axe; Llewella and Flora 
were among the archers. Fiona was 
nowhere in sight. Gerard was not 
there either. Then I saw Random on 
horseback, swinging a heavy blade, 
leading an assault toward the 
enemy’s high ground. Near him was 
a knight clad in green whom I did 
not recognize. The man swung a 
mace with deadly efficiency. He 
wore a bow upon his back and held 
a quiver of gleaming arrows at his 
hip. 

The sounds of the storm came 
louder as I reached the summit of 
my hill. The lightning flickered 
with the regularity of a neon tube 
and the rain sizzled down, a

fiberglass curtain that had now 
passed over the mountains. 

Below me, both beasts and 
men — and more than a few 
beastmen — were woven in knots 
and strands of battle. A cloud of 
dust hung over the field. Assessing 
the distribution of forces, however, 
it did not appear to me that the 
growing forces of the enemy could 
be pushed much farther. In fact, it 
seemed that it was just about time 
for the counterattack. They ap- 
peared to be ready up in their 
craggy places, and just waiting for 
the order. 

I was about a minute and a half 
off. They advanced, sweeping down 
the slope, reinforcing their lines, 
pushing our troops back, driving 
ahead. And more were arriving 
from beyond the dark abyss. Our 
own troops began a reasonably or- 
derly retreat. The enemy pressed 
harder, and when things seemed 
about ready to be turned into a rout, 
an order must have been given. 

I heard the sound of Julian’s ■ 
hom, and shortly thereafter I saw 
him astride Morgenstern, leading 
the men of Arden onto the field. 
This balanced the opposing forces 
almost exactly and the noise level 
rose and rose while the sky turned 
above us. 

I watched the conflict for perhaps 
a quarter of an hour, as our own 
forces slowly withdrew across the 
field. Then I saw a one-armed fig- 
ure on a fiery striped horse sud- 
denly appear atop a distant hill. He 
bore a raised blade in his hand and 
he was faced away from me, toward 
the west. He stood unmoving for 
several long moments. Then he 
lowered the blade. 



I heard trumpets in the west, and 
at first I saw nothing. Then a line 
of cavalry came into view. I started. 
For a moment, I thought Brand was 
there. Then I realized it was Bleys 
leading his troops to strike at the 
enemy’s exposed flank. 

And suddenly our troops in the 
field were no longer retreating. 
They were holding their line. Then 
they were pressing forward. 

Bleys and his riders came on, and 
I realized that Benedict had the day 
again. The enemy was about to be 
ground to pieces. 

Then a cold wind swept over me 
from out of the north, and I looked 
that way again. 

The storm had advanced consid- 
erably. It must have started moving 
faster just recently. And it was 
darker now than it had been, with 
brighter flashes and louder roars. 
And this cold, wet wind was in- 
creasing in intensity. 

I wondered then . .. would it 
simply sweep over the field like an 
annihilating wave and that be that? 
What of the effects of the new Pat- 
tern? Would these follow, to restore 
everything? Somehow I doubted 
this. If this storm smashed us, I’d a 
feeling we would stay smashed. It 
would require the force of the Jewel 
to permit us to ride it out until order 
was restored. And what would be 
left if we survived it? I simply 
could not guess. 

So what was Brand’s plan? What 
was he waiting for? What was he 
going to do? 

I looked out over the battlefield 
once more .... 

Something. 

In a shadowy place on the heights 
where the enemy had regrouped, 



106 



GALAXY 




been reinforced, and down which it 
had stormed . something. 

A tiny flash of red ... I was 
sure I had seen it. 

I kept watching, waiting. I had to 
see it again, to pinpoint it ... 

A minute passed. Two, per- 
haps . 

There! 

And again. 

I wheeled the black charger. It 
looked possible to make it around 
the enemy’s near flank and up to 
that supposedly vacant height. I 
raced down the hill and began that 
course. 

It had to be Brand with the 
Jewel. He had chosen a good, safe 
spot, from which he commanded a 
view of the entire battlefield as well 
as the approaching storm. From 
there, he could direct its lightning 
into our troops as the front ad- 
vanced. He would signal a retreat at 
the proper moment, hit us with the 
storm’s strange furies, then side- 
track the thing to bypass the side he 
was backing. It seemed the simplest 
and most effective use of the Jewel 
under the circumstances. 

I would have to get close fast. 
My control of the stone was greater 
than his, but it diminished with dis- 
tance, and he would have the Jewel 
on his person. My best bet would 
be to charge right into him, to get 
within control range at all costs, 
take over command of the stone and 
use it against him. But he might 
have a bodyguard up there with 
him. That troubled me, because 
dealing with it could slow me disas- 
trously. And if he did not, what 
was to prevent him from teleporting 
himself away if the going got too 
rough? Then what could I do? I 



would have to start all over, hunting 
him again. I wondered whether I 
could use the Jewel to keep him 
from transporting himself. I did not 
know. I resolved to try. 

It might not have been the best of 
plans, but it was the only one I had. 
There was no longer time to plot. 

As I rode, I saw that there were 
others headed for that height, also. 
Random, Deirdre and Fiona, 
mounted and accompanied by eight 
horsemen, had made their way 
through the enemy lines, with a few 
other troops — friends or foes, I 
could not tell, maybe both — riding 
hard behind them. The knight clad 
in green seemed to be moving the 
fastest, gaining on them. I did not 
recognize him — or her, as the case 
might be. I did not doubt the objec- 
tive of the vanguard, however — not 
with Fiona there. She must have de- 
tected Brand’s presence and be lead- 
ing the others to him. A few drops 
of hope fell upon my heart. She 
might be able to neutralize Brand’s 
powers, or minimize them. I leaned 
forward, still bearing to my left, 
hurrying my horse along. The sky 
kept turning. The wind whistled 
about me. A terrific clap of thunder 
rolled by. I did not look back. 

I was racing them. I did not want 
them to get there before me, but I 
feared that they would. The distance 
was just too great. 

If only they would tum and see 
me coming, they would probably 
wait. I wished there had been some 
way of giving them a sign of my 
presence earlier. I cursed the fact 
that the Trumps no longer worked. 

I began shouting. I screamed 
after them, but the wind blew my 
words away and the thunder rolled 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

over them. 

“Wait for me! Damn it! It’s 
Corwin!” 

Not even a glance in my direction 
could I get from them. 

I passed the nearest engagements 
and rode along the enemy’s flank, 
out of range of missiles and arrows. 
They seemed to be retreating faster 
now and our troops were spreading 
out over a larger area. Brand must 
be getting ready to strike. Part of 
the rotating sky was covered by a 
dark cloud which had not been 
above the field minutes before. 

I turned toward my right, behind 
the retreating forces, racing on to- 
ward those hills the others were al- 
ready mounting. 

The sky continued to darken as I 
neared the foot of the hills, and I 
feared for my kinsmen. They were 
getting too close to him. He would 
have to do something. Unless Fiona 
was strong enough to stop 
him .... 

The horse reared and I was 
thrown to the ground at the blinding 
flash which had occurred before 
me. The thunder cracked before I 
hit the earth. 

I lay there for several moments, 
dazed. The horse had run off, was 
perhaps fifty meters, away, before 
he halted and began to move about 
uncertainly. I rolled onto my 
stomach and looked up the long 
slope. The other riders were also 
down. Their group had apparently 
been struck by the discharge. Sev- 
eral were moving, more were not. 
None had yet risen. Above them, I 
saw the red glow of the Jewel, back 
beneath an underhang, brighter and 
steadier now, and the shadowy out- 
line of the figure who wore it.

I began crawling forward, upward 
and to my left. I wanted to get out 
of line of sight with that figure be- 
fore I risked rising. It would take 
too long to reach him crawling, and 
I was going to have to skirt the 
others now, because his attention 
would be with them. 

I made my way carefully, slowly, 
using every bit of cover in sight, 
wondering whether the lightning 
would be striking in the same place 
again soon — and if not, when he 
would begin pulling disaster down 
upon our troops. Any minute now, I 
judged. A glance back showed me 
our forces spread over the far end 
of the field, with the enemy pulled 
back and coming this way. Before 
too long, in fact, it seemed I might 
have them to worry about, too. 

I made it into a narrow ditch and 
wormed my way south for perhaps 
ten meters. Out again then on the 
far side, to take advantage of a rise, 
then some rocks. 

When I raised my head to take 
stock of the situation, I could no 
longer see the glow of the Jewel. 
The cleft from which it had shone 
was blocked by its own eastern 
shoulder of stone. 

I kept crawling, though, near to 
the lip of the great abyss itself, be- 
fore I bore to my right once more. I 
reached a point where it seemed 
safe to rise, and I did so. I kept ex- 
pecting another flash, another 
thunderclap — nearby or on the 
field — but none came. I began to 
wonder why not. I reached out, try- 
ing to sense the presence of the 
Jewel, but I could not. I hurried 
toward the place where I fiad seen 
the glow. 

I glanced back over the abyss to 

GALAXY 




be sure that no new menaces were 
approaching from that direction. I 
drew my blade. When I reached my 
goal, I stayed close to the escarp- 
ment and worked my way north- 
ward. I dropped low when I came 
to its edge and peered around. 

There was no red glow. No 
shadowy figure either. The stony 
recess appeared to be empty. There 
was nothing suspicious anywhere in 
the vicinity. Could he have tele- 
ported again? And if so, why? 

I rose and passed about the rocky 
rise. I continued moving in that di- 
rection. I tried once more to feel the 
Jewel, and this time I made a faint 
contact with it — somewhere off to 
my right and above, it seemed. 

Silent, wary, I moved that way. 
Why had he left his shelter? He had 
been perfectly situated for what he 
had been about. Unless .... 

I heard a scream and a curse. 
Two different voices. I began to 
run. 

XI. 

I passed the niche and kept go- 
ing. Beyond it there was a natural 
trail winding upward. I mounted 
this. 

I could see no one as yet, but my 
sense of the Jewel’s presence grew 
stronger as I moved. I thought that I 
heard a single footfall from off to 
my right and I whirled in that direc- 
tion, but there was no one in sight. 
The Jewel did not feel that near 
either, so I continued on. 

As I neared the top of the rise, 
the black drop of Chaos hanging 
behind, I heard voices. I could not 
distinguish what was being said, but 
the words were agitated. 



I slowed as I neared the crest, 
lowered myself, and peered around 
the side of a rock. 

Random was a small distance 
ahead of me and Fiona was with 
him, as were Lords Chantris and 
Feldane. All, save Fiona, held 
weapons as if ready to use them, 
but they stood perfectly still. They 
were staring toward the edge of 
things — a shelf of rock slightly 
above their level and perhaps fifteen 
meters distant — the place where the 
abyss began. 

Brand stood in that place, and he 
was holding Deirdre before him. 
She was unhelmed, her hair blow- 
ing wild, and he had a dagger at her 
throat. It appeared that he had al- 
ready cut her slightly. I dropped 
back. 

I heard Random say softly, “Is 
there nothing more you can do, 
Fi?” 

“I can hold him here,” he said, 
“and at this range, I can slow his 
efforts at weather control. But that 
is all. He’s got some attunement 
with it and I do not. He also has 
proximity going for him. Anything 
else I might try, he can counter.” 

Random gnawed his lower lip. 

“Put down your weapons,” 
Brand called out. “Do it now, or 
Deirdre’s dead.” 

“Kill her,” Random said, “and 
you lose the only thing that’s keep- 
ing you alive. Do it, and I’ll show 
you where I’ll put my weapon.” 

Brand muttered something under 
his breath. Then, “Okay. I will 
start by mutilating her.” 

Random spat. 

“Come on!” he said. “She can 
regenerate as well as the rest of us. 
Find a threat that means something,

or shut up and fight it out!” 

Brand was still. I thought it better 
not to reveal my presence. There 
must be something I could do. I 
ventured another look, mentally 
photographing the terrain before I 
dropped back. There were some 
rocks way off to the left, but they 
did not extend far enough. I saw no 
way that I might sneak up on him. 

“I think we are going to have to 
rush him and chance it,” I heard 
Random say. “I don’t see anything 
else. Do you?” 

Before anyone answered him, a 
strange thing occurred. The day 
began to grow brighter. 

I looked all about for the source 
of the illumination, then sought it 
overhead. 

The clouds were still there, the 
crazy sky doing its tricks beyond 
them. The brightness was in the 
clouds, however. They had paled 
and were now glowing, as if they 
masked a sun. Even as I watched, 
there was a perceptible brightening. 

“What is he up to now?” Chan- 
tris asked. 

“Nothing that I can tell,” Fiona 
said. “I do not believe it is his do- 
ing.” 

“Whose then?” 

There was no answer that I could 
overhear. 

I watched the clouds grow bright- 
er The largest and brightest of them 
seemed to swirl then, as if stirred. 
Forms tossed within it, settled. An 
outline began to take shape. 

Below me, on the field, the 
sounds of battle lessened. The storm 
itself was muted as the vision grew. 
Something was definitely forming in 
the bright place above our heads — 
the lines of an enormous face. 



“I do not know, I tell you,” I 
heard Fiona say in response to 
something mumbled. 

Before it finished taking form, I 
realized that it was my father’s face 
in the sky. Neat trick, that. And I 
had no idea what it represented 
either. 

The face moved, as if he were 
regarding us all. There were lines of 
strain there, and something of con- 
cern to his expression. The bright- 
ness grew a little further. His lips 
moved. 

When his voice came down to 
me, it was somehow at an ordinary 
conversational level rather than the 
vast booming I had expected: 

“I send you this message,” he 
said, “before undertaking the repair 
of the Pattern. By the time you re- 
ceive it, I will already have suc- 
ceeded or failed. It will precede the 
wave of Chaos which must accom- 
pany my endeavor. I have reason to 
believe the effort will prove fatal to 
me.” 

His eyes seemed to sweep across 
the field. 

“Rejoice or mourn, as you 
would,” he went on, “for this is 
either the beginning or the end. I 
will send the Jewel of Judgment to 
Corwin as soon as I have finished 
with it. I have charged him to bear 
it to the place of conflict. All of 
your efforts there will be as nothing 
if the wave of Chaos cannot be 
averted. But with the Jewel, in that 
place, Corwin should be able to 
preserve you until it passes.” 

I heard Brand’s laugh. He 
sounded quite mad now. 

“With my passing,” the voice 
continued, “the problem of the suc- 
cession will be upon you. I had 



110 



GALAXY 




wishes in this regard, but I see now 
that these were futile. Therefore, I 
have no choice but to leave this on 
the horn of the unicom. 

“My children, I cannot say that I 
am entirely pleased with you, but I 
suppose this works both ways. Let 
it be. I leave you with my blessing, 
which is more than a formality. I go 
now to walk the Pattern. Good- 
bye.” 

Then his face began to fade and 
the brightness drained out of the 
cloudbank. A little while, and it 
was gone. A stillness lay upon the 
field. 

”... and, as you can see,” I 
heard Brand saying, “Corwin does 
not have the Jewel. Throw down 
your weapons and get the hell out 
of here. Or keep them and gel out. 

1 do not care. Leave me alone. I 
have things to do.” 

“Brand,” Fiona said, “can you 
do what he wanted of Corwin? Can 
you use it to make that thing miss 
us?” 

“I could if I would,” he said. 
“Yes, I could turn it aside.” 

“You will be a hero if you do,” 
she said gently. “You will earn our 
gratitude. All past wrongs will be 
forgiven. Forgiven and forgotten. 
We—” 

He began to laugh wildly. 

“ You forgive we?” he said. 
“You, who left me in that tower, 
who put the knife into my side? 
Thank you, sister. It is very kind of 
you to offer to forgive me, but ex- 
cuse me if I decline.” 

“All right,” Random said, 
“what do you want? A 

“ You forgive we?” he said. 
“You, who left me in that tower, 
who put the knife into my side? 




THE COURTS OF CHAOS

Thank you, sister. It is very kind of 
you to offer to forgive me, but ex- 
cuse me if I decline.” 

“All right,” Random said, 
“what do you want? An apology? 
Riches and treasure? An important 
appointment? All of these? They are 
yours. But this is a stupid game you 
are playing. Let us end it and go 
home, pretend it was all a bad 
dream.” 

“Yes, let us end it,” Brand re- 
plied. “You do that by throwing 
down your weapons first. Then 
Fiona releases me from her spell, 
you all do an about face and march 
north. You do it or I kill Deirdre.” 
“Then I think you had better go 
ahead and kill her and be ready to 
fight it out with me,” Random said, 
“because she will be dead in a little 
while anyway, if we let you have 
your way. All of us will.” 

I heard Brand’s chuckle. 

“Do you honestly think I am 
going to let you die? I need 
you — as many of you as I can save. 
Hopefully Deirdre, too. You are the 
only ones who can appreciate my 
triumph. I will preserve you through 
the holocaust that is about to be- 
gin.” 

“I do not believe you,” Random 
said. 

“Then take a moment and think 
about it. You know me well enough 
to know that I will want to rub your 
noses in it. I want you as witnesses 
to what I dcr. In this sense, I require 
your presence in my new world. 
Now, get out of here.” 

“You will have everything you 
want plus our gratitude,” Fiona be- 
gan, “if you will just — ” 

“Go!” 

I knew that I could delay no 



longer. I had to make my move. I 
also knew that I could not reach 
him in time. I had no choice but to 
try using the Jewel as a weapon 
against him. 

I reached out and felt its p 
esence. I closed my eyes and sum- 
moned my powers. 

Hot. Hot, I thought. It is burning 
you, Brand. It is causing every 
molecule in your body to vibrate 
faster and faster. You are about to 
become a human torch — 

I heard him scream. 

“Corwin!” he bellowed. “Stop 
it! Wherever you are! I’ll kill her! 
Look!” 

Still willing the Jewel to bum 
him, I rose to my feet. I glared at 
him across the distance that sepa- 
rated us. His clothing was begin- 
ning to smoulder. 

“Stop it!” he cried, and he 
raised the knife and slashed 
Deirdre’s face. 

I screamed and my eyes swam. I 
lost control of the Jewel. But 
Deirdre, her left cheek bloody, sank 
her teeth into his hand as he moved 
to cut her again. Then her arm was 
free, and she jabbed her elbow into 
his ribs and tried to pull away. 

As soon as she moved, as soon 
as her head dropped, there was a 
silver flash. Brand gasped and let 
go the dagger. An arrow had 
pierced his throat. Another followed 
an instant later and stood out from 
his breast, a little to the right of the 
Jewel. 

He stepped backward and made a 
gurgling noise. Only there was no 
place to which he might step from 
the edge of the abyss. 

His eye went wide as he began to 
topple. Then his right hand shot 



112 



GALAXY 




forward and caught hold of 
Deirdre’s hair. I was running by 
then, shouting, but I knew that I 
could not reach them in time. 

Deirdre howled, a look of terror 
on her bloodstreaked face, and she 
reached out to me ... 

Then Brand, Deirdre and the 

Jewel were over the edge and fall- 
ing, vanished from sight* 

gone .... 

I believe that I tried to throw my- 
self after them, but Random caught 
hold of me. Finally, he had to hit 
me, and it all went away. 

* * ★ 

When J came around, I lay upon 
the stony earth farther back from 
the edge of that place where I had 
fallen. Someone had folded my 

cloak into a pillow for me. My first 
vision was of the turning sky, re- 
minding me somehow of my dream 
of the wheel the day I had met 
Dara. I could feel the others about 
me, hear their voices, but I did not 
at first tum my head. I just lay 
there and regarded the mandala in 
the heavens and thought upon my 
loss. Deirdre . she had meant 
more to me than all the rest of the 
family put together. I cannot help 
it. That is how it was. How many 
times had I wished she were not my 
sister. Yet I had reconciled myself 
to the realities of our situation. My 
feelings would never change, 
but . now she was gone, and this 
thought meant more to me than the 
impending destruction of the world. 

Yet, I had to see what was hap- 
pening now. With the Jewel gone, 
everything was over. Yet ... I 
reached out, trying to feel its pres- 



ence, wherever it might be, but 
there was nothing. I began to rise 
then, to see how far the wave had 
advanced, but a sudden arm pushed 
me back. 

“Rest, Corwin.” It was Ran- 
dom’s voice. “You’re beat. You 
look as if you have just crawled 
through hell. There is nothing you 
can do now. Take it easy.” 

“What difference does the state 
of my health make?” I replied. “In 
a little while, it will not matter.” 

I made to rise again, and this 
time the arm moved to support me. 

“All right, then,” he said. “Not 
that much worth seeing, though.” 

I suppose that he was right. The 
fighting appeared to be over except 
for a few isolated pockets of re- 
sistance by the enemy, and these 
were rapidly being enveloped, their 
combatants slain or captured, ev- 
eryone moving in this direction, 
withdrawing before the advancing 
wave which had reached the far end 
of the field. Soon our height would 
be crowded with all of the survivors 
from both sides. I looked behind us. 
No new forces were approaching 
from the dark citadel. Could we re- 
treat to that place when the wave 
finally reached us here? Then what? 
The abyss seemed the ultimate an- 
swer. “Soon,” I muttered, thinking 
of Deirdre. “Soon . ” Why 
not? 

I watched the stormfront, flash- 
ing, masking, transforming. Yes, 
soon. With the Jewel gone along 
with Brand — 

“Brand ...” I said. “Who was 
it finally got him?” 

“I claim that distinction,” said a 
familiar voice which I could not 
place. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

I turned my head and stared. The 
man in green was seated on a rock. 
His bow and quiver lay beside him 
on the ground. He flashed an evil 
smile in my direction. 

It was Caine. 

“I’ll be damned,” I said, rubbing 
my jaw. “A funny thing happened 
to me on the way to your funeral.” 

“Yes. I heard about it.” He 
laughed. “You ever kill yourself, 
Corwin?” 

‘‘Not recently. How’d you man- 
age it?” 

“Walked to the proper shadow,” 
he said, “waylaid the shadow of 
myself there. He provided the 
corpse.” He shuddered. “An eerie 
feeling, that. Not one I’d care to 
repeat.” 

“But why?” I said. “Why fake 
your death and try to frame me for 
it?” 

“I wanted to get to the root of 
the trouble in Amber,” he said, 
“and destroy it. I thought it best to 
go underground for that. What bet- 
ter way than by convincing ev- 
eryone that I was dead? I finally 
succeeded, too, as you saw.” He 
paused. “I’m sorry about Deirdre, 
though. But I had no choice. It was 
our last chance. I did not really 
think he would take her with him.” 

I looked away. 

“I had no choice,” he repeated. 
“I hope you can see that.” 

I nodded. 

“But why did you try to make it 
look as if I had killed you?” I 
asked. 

Just then Fiona approached with 
Bleys. I greeted them both and 
turned back to Caine for my an- 
swer. There were things I wanted to 
ask Bleys, too, but they would 



wait. 

“Well?” I said. 

“I wanted you out of the way,” 
he said. “I still thought you might 
be behind the whole thing. You or 
Brand. I had it narrowed down that 
far. I thought it might even be the 
two of you in it together — 
especially with him struggling to 
bring you back.” 

“You have that wrong,” said 
Bleys. “Brand was trying to keep 
him away. He had learned that his 
memory was returning and — ” 

“I gather,” Caine relied, “but at 
the time it looked that way. So I 
wanted Corwin back in a dungeon 
while I searched for Brand. I lay 
low then and listened in on the 
Trumps to everything everyone 
said, hoping for a clue as to 
Brand’s whereabouts.” 

“That’s what Dad meant,” I 
said. 

“What?” 

“He implied there was an eaves- 
dropper on the Trumps.” 

“I do not see how he could have 
known. I had learned to be com- 
pletely passive about it. I had taught 
myself to deal them all out and 
touch all of them lightly at the same 
time, waiting for a stirring. When it 
came, I would shift my attention to 
the speakers. Taking you one at a 
time, I even found I could some- 
times get into your minds when you 
were not using the Trumps 
yourselves — if you were sufficiently 
distracted and I allowed myself no 
reaction.” 

“Yet he knew,” I said. 

“It is entirely possible. Likely, 
even,” said Fiona, and Bleys nod- 
ded. 

Random drew nearer. 



114 



GALAXY 




“What did you mean when you 
asked about Corwin’s side?” he in- 
quired. “How could you even know 
about it unless — ” 

Caine merely nodded. I saw Ben- 
edict and Julian together in the dis- 
tance, addressing their troops. At 
Caine’s silent movement, I forgot 
them. 

“You?” I croaked. “You stab- 
bed me?” 

“Have a drink, Corwin,” Ran- 
dom said, passing me his flask. It 
was a dilute wine. I gulped it. My 
thirst was immense, but I stopped 
after several good swigs. 

“Tell me about it,” I said. 

“All right. I owe you that,” he 
said. “When I learned from Julian’s 
mind that you had brought Brand 
back to Amber, I decided that an 
earlier guess had been correct — that 
you and Brand were in it together. 
That meant you both had to be de- 
stroyed. I used the Pattern to project 
myself into your chambers that 
night. There I tried to kill you, but 
you moved too fast and you some- 
how managed to Trump out before I 
got a second chance.” 

“Well, damn your eyes,” I said. 
“If you could touch our minds, 
couldn’t you have seen that I was 
not the man you were looking for?” 
He shook his head. 

“I could only pick up surface 
thoughts and reactions to your im- 
mediate environment. Not always 
that, even. And I had heard your 
curse, Corwin. And it was coming 
true. I could see it all around us. I 
felt that we would all be a lot safer 
with you and Brand both out of the 
way. I knew what he could do, 
from his actions back before your 
return. I could not get at him just 



then, though, because of Gerard. 
Then he began to grow stronger. I 
made one effort later, but it failed.” 

“When was that?” Random 
asked. 

“That was the one Corwin got 
blamed for. I masked myself. In 
case he managed to get away as 
Corwin had, I did not want him 
knowing I was still around. I used 
the Pattern to project myself into his 
chambers and tried to finish him 
off. We were both hurt — there was 
a lot of blood around — but he man- 
aged to Trump away, too. Then I 
got in touch with Julian a while 
back and joined him for this battle, 
because Brand just had to show up 
here. I had some silver-tipped ar- 
rows made because I was more than 
half-convinced that he was no 
longer like the rest of us. I wanted 
to kill him fast and do it from a dis- 
tance. I practiced my archery and 
came looking for him. I finally 
found him. Now everyone tells me I 
was wrong about you, so I guess 
your arrow will go unused.” 

“Thanks a lot.” 

“I might even owe you an apol- 
ogy.” 

“That would be nice.” 

“On the other hand, I thought 
that I was right. I was doing it to 
save the rest — ” 

I never did get Caine’s apology, 
because just then a trumpet blast 
seemed to shake the entire world — 
directionless, loud, prolonged. We 
cast about, seeking its source. 

Caine stood and pointed. 

“There!” he said. 

My eyes followed his gesture. 
The curtain of the stormfront was 
broken off to the northwest, at the 
point where the black road emerged 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



115 




from it. There a ghostly rider on a 
black horse had appeared and was 
winding his hom. It was a while be- 
fore more of its notes reached us. 
Moments later, two more trum- 
peters — also pale, and mounted on 
black steeds — joined him. They 
raised their horns and added to the 
sound. 

“What can it be?” Random 
asked. 

“I think I know,” Bleys said, 
and Fiona nodded. 

“What, then?” I asked. 

But they did not answer me. The 
horsemen were beginning to move 
again, passing along the black road, 
and more were emerging behind 
them. 

XII. 

I watched. There was a great si- 
lence on the heights about me. All 
of the troops had halted and were 
regarding the procession. Even the 
prisoners from the Courts, hemmed 
by steel, turned their attention that 
way. 

Led by the pale trumpeters, came 
a mass of horsemen mounted on 
white steeds, bearing banners, some 
of which I did not recognize, be- 
hind a man-thing who bore the uni- 
corn standard of Amber. These wer 
e followed by more musicians, 
some of them playing upon instru- 
ments of a sort I had never seen be- 
fore. 

Behind the musicans marched 
homed man-shaped things in light 
armor, long columns of them, and 
every twentieth or so bore a great 
torch before him, reaching high 
above his head. A deep noise came 
to us then — slow, rhythmic, rolling 



beneath the notes of the trumpets 
and the sounds of the musicians — 
and I realized that the foot soldiers 
were singing. A great deal of time 
seemed to pass as this body ad- 
vanced along that black way across 
the distant track below us, yet none 
of us stirred and none of us spoke. 
They passed, with the torches and 
the banners and the music and the 
singing, and they finally came to 
the edge of the abyss and continued 
on over the near-invisible extension 
of that dark highway, their torches 
flaring against the blackness now, 
lighting their way. The music grew 
stronger, despite the distance, with 
more and more voices added to that 
chorus, as the guard continued to 
emerge from that flashing stormcur- 
tain. An occasional roll of thunder 
passed by, but this could not drown 
it; nor did the winds which assailed 
the torches extinguish any so far as 
I could see. The movement had a 
hypnotic effect. It seemed that I had 
been watching the procession for 
countless days, years perhaps, lis- 
tening to the tune I now recognized. 

Suddenly a dragon sailed through 
the stormfront, and another, and 
another. Green and golden and 
black as old iron, I watched them 
soar on the winds, turning their 
heads to trail pennons of fire. The 
lightning flashed behind them and 
they were awesome and magnificent 
and of incalculable size. Beneath 
them came a small herd of white 
cattle, tossing their heads and blow- 
ing, beating the ground with their 
hoofs. Riders passed beside and 
among these, cracking long black 
whips. 

Then came a procession of truly 
bestial troops from a shadow with 



116 



GALAXY 




which Amber sometimes has 
commerce — heavy, scaled, tal- 
oned — playing upon instruments 
like bagpipes, whose skirling notes 
came to us with vibrance and 
pathos. 

These marched on, and there 
were more torchbearers and more 
troops with their colors — from 
shadows both distant and near. We 
watched them pass and wind their 
way into the far sky, like a migra- 
tion of fireflies, their destination 
that black citadel called the Courts 
of Chaos. 

There seemed no end to it. I had 
lost all track of time. But the 
stormfront, strangely, was not ad- 
vancihg as all this went on. I had 
even lost something of my sense of 
person, to be caught up in the pro- 
cession which passed us. This, I 
knew, was an event which could 
never be repeated. Bright flying 
things darted above the columns and 
dark ones floated, higher. 

There were ghostly drummers, 
beings of pure light, and a flock of 
floating machines; I saw horsemen, 
clad all in black, mounted on a va- 
riety of beasts; a wyvem seemed to 
hang in the sky for a moment, like 
part of a fireworks display. And the 
sounds — of hoofbeats and footfalls, 
of singing and skirling, of drum- 
ming and trumpeting — mounted to a 
mighty wave that washed over us. 
And on, on, on out over the bridge 
of darkness, wound the procession, 
its lights lining the great span for a 
vast distance now. 

Then, as my eyes drifted back 
along those lines, another shape 
emerged from the glistening curtain. 
It was a cart draped all in black and 
drawn by a team of black horses. 



At each comer rose a staff which 
glowed with blue fire, and atop it 
rested what could only be a casket, 
draped with our Unicom flag. The 
driver was a hunchback clad in pur- 
ple and orange garments, and I 
knew even at that distance that it 
was Dworkin. 

It is thus, then, I thought. I do 
not know why, but somehow it is fit- 
ting, fitting that it be the Old Coun- 
try to which you travel now. There 
were many things that I might have 
said while you lived. Some of them 
I did say, but few of the right words 
were ever spoken. Now it is over, 
for you are dead. As dead as all of 
those who have gone before you 
into that place where the rest of us 
soon may follow. I am sorry. It was 
only after all these years, on your 
assuming another face and form, 
that / finally knew you, respected 
you, even came to like you — though 
you were a crochety old bastard in 
that form, too. Was the Ganelon 
self the real you all along, or was it 
only another form adopted for con- 
venience’s sake. Old Shapeshifter? I 
will never know, but I like to think 
that I finally saw you as you were, 
that / met someone I liked, someone 
/ could trust, and that it was you. I 
wish that / might have known you 
even better, but I am grateful for 
this much .... 

“Dad. ?” Julian said softly. 

“He wanted to be taken beyond 
the Courts of Chaos and into the 
final darkness when his time came 
at last,” Bleys said. “So Dworkin 
once told me. Beyond Chaos and 
Amber, to a place where none 
reigned.” 

“And so it is,” Fiona said. “But 
is there order somewhere beyond 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

that wall they came through? Or 
does the storm go on forever? If he 
succeeded, it is but a passing matter 
and we are in no danger. But if he 
did not . 

“It does not matter,” I said, 
“whether or not he succeeded, be- 
cause I did.” 

“What do you mean?” she 
asked. 

“I believe that he failed,” I said, 
“that he was destroyed before he 
could repair the Old Pattern. When 
I saw this storm coming — actually, 
I experienced a part of it — I realized 
that I could not possibly make it 
here in time with the Jewel, which 
he had sent to me after his efforts. 
Brand had been trying to, get it from 
me all along the way — to create a 
new Pattern, he said. Later that 
gave me the idea. When I saw that 
all else was failing, I used the Jewel 
to create a new Pattern. It was the 
most difficult thing I ever did, but I 
succeeded. Things should hold to- 
gether after this wave passes, 
whether we survive it or not. Brand 
stole the Jewel from me just as I 
completed it. When I recovered 
from his attack, I was able to use 
the new Pattern to project me here. 
So there is still a Pattern, no matter 
what else happens.” 

“But, Corwin,” she said, “what 
if Dad succeeded?’ ’ 

“I do not know.” 

“It is my understanding,” Bleys 
said, “from things that Dworkin 
told me, that two distinct Patterns 
could not exist in the same uni- 
verse. Those in Rebma and Tir-na 
Nog’th do not count, being but re- 
flections of our own ....*’ 

“What would happen?” I said. 

“I think there would be a split- 



ting off, the founding of a new 
existence — somewhere . ’ ’ 

“Then what would its effect be 
upon our own?” 

“Either total catastrophe or no ef- 
fect whatsoever,” Fiona said. “I 
can make a case for its going either 
way.” 

“Then we are right back where 
we started,” I said. “Either things 
are going to fall apart shortly or 
they are going to hold.” 

“So it would seem,” Bleys said. 

“It does not matter, if we are not 
going to be around after that wave 
gets to us,” I said. “And it will.” 

I turned my attention back to the 
funeral cortege. More horsemen had 
emerged behind the wagon, fol- 
lowed by marching drummers. The 
pennons and torches and a long line 
of foot soldiers. The singing still 
came to us, and far, far out over the 
abyss it seemed the procession 
might finally have reached that dark 
citadel. 

. / hated you for so long, 
blamed you for so many things. 
Now it is over, and none of those 
feelings remain. Instead, you had 
even wanted me to be king, a job 
for which — I see now — 1 am not fit- 
ted. I see that I must have meant 
something to you after all. I will 
never tell the others. It is enough to 
know it myself. But I can never 
think of you in the same fashion 
again. Already your image blurs. I 
see Gane Ion's face where yours 
should be. He was my companion. 
He risked his neck for me. He was 
you, but a different you — a you that 
I had not known. How many wives 
and enemies had you outlived? 
Were there many friends? I think 
not. But there were so many things 



118 



GALAXY 




about you of which we knew noth- 
ing. I never thought that / would 
see your passing. Ganelon — 
father — old friend and enemy, I bid 
you farewell. You join Deirdre, 
whom / have loved. You have pre- 
served your mystery. Rest in peace, 
if that be your will. I give you this 
withered rose 1 have borne through 
hell, casting it into the abyss. I 
leave you the rose and the twisted 
colors in the sky. / will miss 
you .... 

Finally the long line came to an 
end. The last marchers emerged 
from the curtain and moved away. 
The lightning still flared, the rain 
still poured and the thunder rum- 
bled. No member of the procession 
that I could recall had seemed wet, 
however. I had been standing at the 
edge of the abyss, watching them 
pass. There was a hand on my arm. 
How long it had been there, I could 
not tell. Now that the passage was 
complete, I realized that the 
stormfront was advancing again. 

The rotation of the sky seemed to 
be bringing more darkness upon us. 
There were voices off to my left. It 
seemed they had been talking for a 
long while, but I had not been hear- 
ing their words. I realized that I 
was shaking, that I ached all over, 
that I could barely stand. 

“Come and lie down,” Fiona 
said. “The family has shrunken 
enough for one day.” 

1 let her lead me away from the 
edge. 

“Would it really make any dif- 
ference?” I asked. “How much 
longer do you think we have?” 

“We do not have to stay here 
and wait for it,” she said. “We 
will cross the dark bridge into the 



Courts. We have already broken 
their defense. The storm may not 
reach that far. It may be stopped 
here by the abyss. We ought to see 
Dad off, anyway.” 

I nodded. 

“It would seem we have small 
choice but to be dutiful unto the 
end.” 

I eased myself down and sighed. 
If anything, I felt even weaker now. 

“Your boots . she said. 

“Yes.” 

She pulled them off. My feet 
throbbed. 

“Thanks.” 

“I’ll get you some rations.” 

I closed my eyes. I dozed. Too 
many images played within my 
head to make for a coherent dream. 
How long this lasted, I do not 
know, but an old reflex drew me to 
wakefulness at the sound of an ap- 
proaching horse. Then a shadow 
passed over my eyelids. 

I looked up and beheld a muffled 
rider, silent, still. I was regarded. 

I looked back. No threatening 
gesture had been made, but there 
was a feeling of antipathy in that 
cold gaze. 

“There lies the hero,” said a soft 
voice. 

I said nothing. 

“I could slay you easily now.” 

I recognized the voice then, 
though I had no idea as to the rea- 
son behind the sentiment. 

“1 came upon Borel before he 
died,” she said. “He told me how 
ignobly you had bested him.” 

I could not help it, I could not 
control it. A dry chuckle rose in my 
throat. Of all the stupid things to 
get upset about. I might have told 
her that Borel had been far better 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



119 




equipped and far fresher than I, and 
that he had come to me looking for 
a fight. I might have told her that I 
do not recognize rules when my life 
is at stake, or that I do not consider 
war a game. I could have said a 
great number of things, but if she 
did not know them already or did 
not choose to understand them, they 
would not have made a bit of dif- 
ference. Besides, her feelings were 
already plain. 

So I simply said one of the great 
trite truths, “There is generally 
more than one side to a story.” 

“I will settle for the one I have,” 
she told me. 

I thought about shrugging, but 
my shoulders were too sore. 

“You have cost me two of the 
most important persons in my life,” 
she said then. 

“Oh?” I said. “I’m sorry, for 
you.” 

“You are not what I was led to 
believe. I had seen you as a truly 
noble figure — strong, yet under- 
standing and sometimes gentle. 
Honorable . .” 

The storm, much closer now, was 
flaring at her back. I thought of 
something vulgar and said it. She 
let it pass as if she had not heard 
me. 

“I am going now,” she said, 
“back to my own people. You have 
won the day thus far — but that way 
lay Amber.” She gestured toward 
the storm. I could only stare. Not at 
the raging element. At her. “I 
doubt there is anything of my new 
allegiance left for me to renounce,” 
she continued. 

“What about Benedict?” I asked 
softly. 

“Don’t ...” she said, and she 



turned away. There was a silence. 
Then, “I do not believe that we 
will ever meet again,” she said, 
and her horse carried her off to my 
left, in the direction of the black 
road. 

A cynic might have decided that 
she had simply chosen to toss in her 
lot with what she now saw as the 
winning side, as the Courts of 
Chaos would likely survive. 1 sim- 
ply did not know. I could only 
think of what I had seen when she 
had gestured. The cowling had slip- 
ped away and I had gotten a 
glimpse of what she had become. It 
had not been a human face, there 
within the shadows. But I turned 
my head and watched until she was 
gone. With Deirdre, Brand and Dad 
gone, and now a parting with Dara 
on these terms, the world was much 
emptier — whatever was left of it. 

I lay back and sighed. Why not 
just remain here when the others 
departed, wait for the. storm to wash 
over me, and sleep . .dissolve? I 
thought of Hugi. Had I digested his 
flight from life as well as his flesh? 
I was so tired that it seemed the 
easiest course .... 

“Here, Corwin.” 

I had been dozing again, though 
only for a moment. Fiona was be- 
side me once more, with rations and 
a flask. Someone was with her. 

“I did not wish to interrupt your 
audience,” she said. v “So I 
waited.” 

“You heard?” I asked. 

“No, but I can guess,” she said, 
“since she is gone. Here.” 

I swallowed some wine, turned 
my attention to the meat, the bread. 
Despite my state of mind, they 
tasted good to me.

“We will be moving soon,” 
Fiona said, casting a glance at the 
raging stormfront. “Can you ride?” 

“I think so,” I said. 

I took another drink of the wine. 

“But too much has happened, 
Fi,” I told her. “I have gone numb 
emotionally. 

“I broke out of a sanitarium on a 
shodow world. I have tricked 
people and I’ve killed people. I 
have calculated and I have fought. I 
won back my memory and I have 
been trying to straighten out my 
life. I have found my family, and 
found that I love it. I have been re- 
conciled with Dad. I have fought 
for the kingdom. I have tried every- 
thing I know to hold things to- 
gether. Now it appears that it has 
all come to nothing, and I have not 
enough spirit left to moum further. 
1 have gone numb. Forgive me.” 

She kissed me. 

“We are not yet beaten. You will 
be yourself again,” she said. 

I shook my head. 

“It is like the last chapter of 
Alice," I said. “If I shout, ‘You 
are only a pack of cards!’ I feel we 
will all fly into the air, hand of 
painted pasteboards. I am not going 
with you. Leave me here. I am only 
the Joker, anyway.” 

“Right now I am stronger than 
you are,” she said. “You are com- 
mg. 

“It is not fair,” I said softly. 

“Finish eating,” she said. 
“There is still some time.” 

As I did, she went on, “Your 
son Merlin is waiting to see you. I 
would like to call him up here 
now.” 

“Prisoner?” 

“Not exactly. He was not a com- 



batant. He just arrived a little while 
ago, asking to see you.” 

I nodded and she went away. I 
abandoned my rations and took 
another swig of wine. I had just be- 
come nervous. What do you say to 
a grown son you only recently 
learned existed? I wondered about 
his feelings toward me. I wondered 
whether he knew of Dara’s deci- 
sion. How should I act with him.? 

I watched him approach from a 
place where my relatives were clus- 
tered, far off to my left. I had won- 
dered why they had left me by my- 
self this way. The more visitors I 
received, the more apparent it be- 
came. 

I wondered whether they were 
holding up the withdrawal because 
of me. The storm’s moist winds 
were growing stronger. He was star- 
ing at me as he advanced, no spe- 
cial expression on that face so much 
like my own. 

I wondered how Dara felt now 
that her prophecy of the destruction 
seemed to have been fulfilled 1 . I 
wondered how her relationship with 
the boy actually stood. I wondered 
. many things. 

He leaned forward to clasp my 
hand. 

“Father . .’’he said. 

“Merlin.” I looked into his eyes. 
I rose to my feet, still holding his 
hand. 

“Do not get up,” 

“It is all right.” I clasped him to 
me, then released him. “I am 
glad,” I said. Then, “Drink with 
me.” I offered him the wine, partly 
to cover my lack of words. 

“Thank you.” 

He took it, drank some and 
passed it back.

“Your health,” I said and took a 
sip myself. “Sorry 1 cannot offer 
you a chair.” 

1 lowered myself to the ground. 
He did the same. 

“None of the others seemed to 
know exactly what you have been 
doing,” he said, “except for Fiona, 
who only said that it had been very 
difficult.” 

“No matter,” I said. “I am glad 
to have made it this far, if for no 
other reason than this. Tell me of 
yourself, son. What are you like? 
How has life treated you?” 

He looked away. 

“I have not lived long enough to 
have done too much,” he said. 

I was curious whether he pos- 
sessed the shapeshifting ability, but 
restrained myself from asking at this 
point. No sense in looking for our 
differences when I had just met 
him. 

“I have no idea what it was 
like,” I said, “growing up in the 
Courts.” 

He smiled for the first time. 

“And I have no idea what it 
would have been like anywhere 
else,” he responded. “I was differ- 
ent enough to be left to myself a 
lot. I was taught the usual things a 
gentlemen should know: magic, 

weapons, poisons, riding, dancing. 
1 was told that I would one day rule 
in Amber. This is not true anymore, 
is it?” 

“It does not seem too likely in 
the foreseeable future,” I said. 

“Good,” he replied. “This is the 
one thing I did not want to do.” 

“What do you want to do?” 

“I want to walk the Pattern in 
Amber as mother did and gain 
power over Shadow, so that I might 



walk there and see strange sights 
and do different things. Do you 
think I might?” 

I took another sip and I passed 
him the wine. 

“It is quite possible,” I said, 
“that Amber no longer exists. It all 
depends on whether your grand- 
father succeeded in something he 
attempted — and he is no longer 
around to tell us what happened. 
However, one way or the other, 
there is a Pattern. If we live through 
this demon storm, I promise you 
that I will find you a Pattern, in- 
struct you and see you walking it.” 

“Thanks,” he said. “Now will 
you tell me of your journey here?” 

“Later,” I told him. “What did 
they tell you of me?” 

He looked away. 

“I was taught to dislike many of 
the things about Amber,” he finally 
said. Then, after a pause, “You, I 
was taught to respect, as my father. 
But I was reminded that you were 
of the party of the enemy.” 
Another pause. “I remember that 
time on patrol, when you had come 
to this place and I found you, after 
your fight with Kwan. My feelings 
were mixed. You had just slain 
someone I had known, yet — I had 
to admire the stand you took. I saw 
my face in your own. It was 
strange. I wanted to know you bet- 
ter.” 

The sky had rotated completely 
and the darkness was now above us, 
the colors passing over the Courts. 
The steady advance of the flashing 
stormfront was emphasized by this. 
I leaned forward and reached for 
my boots, began pulling them on. 
Soon it would be time to begin our 
retreat. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

“We will have to continue our 
conversation on your home 
ground,” I said. “It is about time 
to fly the storm.” 

He turned and considered the 
elements, then looked back out over 
the abyss. 

“I can summon a filmy if you 
wish.” 

“One of those drifting bridges 
such as you rode on the day we 
met?” 

“Yes,” he answered. “They are 
most convenient. I — ” 

There had been a shout from the 
direction of my assembled relatives. 
Nothing threatening seemed to be 
about when I regarded them. So I 
got to my feet and took a few steps 
toward them, Merlin rising to fol- 
low me. 

Then I saw her. A white form, 
pawing air it seemed, and rising out 
of the abyss. Her front hoofs finally 
struck its brink, and she came for- 
ward and then stood still, regarding 
us all: our unicorn. 



XIII. 

For a moment my aches and my 
fatigue fell away. I felt a tiny 
twinge of something like hope as I 
considered the dainty white form 
which stood before us. A part of me 
wanted to rush forward, but some- 
thing much stronger kept me mo- 
tionless, waiting. 

How long we stood thus, I could 
not tell. Below, on the slopes, the 
troops had been readying them- 
selves for travel. The prisoners had 
been bound, horses loaded, equip- 
ment secured. But this vast army in 
the process of march-ordering its 



gear had suddenly halted. It was not 
natural that they should have be- 
come aware so quickly, but every 
head that I could see was turned in 
this direction, toward the unicorn on 
the brink, limned against that wild 
sky. 

I was suddenly aware that the 
wind at my back had grown still, 
though the thunder continued to 
rumble and explode and the light- 
ning flares threw dancing shadows 
before me. 

I thought of the other time I had 
seen the unicorn — at the recovery of 
the Shadow-Caine’s body, the day I 
had lost a fight with Gerard. I 
thought of the stories I had 
heard . could she really help us? 

The unicom took a step forward 
and halted. 

She was such a lovely thing that 
somehow I was heartened just by 
looking upon her. It was a kind of 
aching feeling that she aroused, 
though; hers was a. beauty of the 
sort to be taken in small doses. And 
I could somehow sense the unnatu- 
ral intelligence within that snowy 
head. I wanted very badly to touch 
her, but knew that 1 could not. 

She cast her gaze all about. Her 
eyes lighted upon me, and I would 
have looked away if I were able. 
This was not possible, however, 
and I returned that gaze in which I 
read an understanding beyond my 
own. It was as if she knew every- 
thing about me, and in this instant 
had comprehended all of my recent 
trials — seeing, understanding, pos- 
sibly sympathizing. For a moment I 
felt that I saw something of pity and 
a strong love reflected there — and 
perhaps a touch of humor. 

Then her head turned and the 



124 



GALAXY 




gaze was broken. I sighed involun- 
tarily. At that moment, in the light- 
ning’s glare, 1 thought I caught a 
glimpse of something shining at the 
side of her neck. 

She advanced another step, and 
now she was looking upon the 
crowd of my kinsmen toward which 
I had been moving. She lowered her 
head and made a small whickering 
noise. She tapped at the earth with 
her right front hoof. 

I felt Merlin at my side. I thought 
upon things I would be losing if it 
all ended here. 

She took several dancing steps 
forward. She tossed her head and 
lowered it. It seemed that she did 
not like the notion of approaching 
so large a group of people. 

At her next step, I saw the glitter 
again, and more. A tiny spark of 
red shone through her fur farther 
down on her neck. She was wearing 
the Jewel of Judgment. How she 
had retrieved it, I had no idea. And 
it did not matter. If she would just 
deliver it, I felt that I could break 
the storm — or at least shield us 
from this section of it until it had 
passed. 

But that one glance had been 
enough. She paid me no more heed. 
Slowly, carefully, as if ready to bolt 
at the slightest disturbance, she ad- 
vanced upon the spot where Julian, 
Random, Bleys, Fiona, Llewella, 
Benedict and several nobles stood. 

I should have realized then what 
was occurring, but I did not. I sim- 
ply watched the sleek beast’s 
movements as she picked her way 
forward, passing about the 
periphery of the group. 

She halted once again and low- 
ered her head. Then she shook her 



mane and dropped to her front 
knees. The Jewel of Judgment hung 
suspended from her twisted, golden 
hom. The tip of her hom was al- 
most touching the person before 
whom she knelt. 

Suddenly, in my mind’s eye, I 
saw our father’s face in the 
heavens, and his words came back 
to me: “With my passing, the prob- 
lem of the succession will be upon 
you ... I have no choice but to 
leave this on the hom of the uni- 
corn.” 

A murmur moved through the 
group, as I realized this same 
thought must be occurring to the 
others. The unicorn did not stir at 
this disturbance, however, but re- 
mained a soft, white statue, not 
even seeming to breathe. 

Slowly Random reached forward 
and removed the Jewel from her 
hom. His whisper carried to me. 

“Thank you,” he said. 

Julian unsheathed his blade and 
placed it at Random’s feet as he 
knelt. Then Bleys and Benedict and 
Caine, Fiona and Llewella. 1 went 
and joined them. So did my son. 

Random stood silent for a long 
while. Then, “I accept your al- 
legiance,” he said. “Now get up, 
all of you.” 

As we did, the unicorn turned 
and bolted. She raced down the 
slope and was out of sight in a mat- 
ter of moments. 

“I had never expected anything 
like this to happen,” Random said, 
still holding the Jewel at eye level. 
“Corwin, can you take this thing 
and stop that storm?” 

“It is yours now,” I said, “and I 
do not know how extensive the dis- 
turbance is. It occurs to me that in 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



125 




my present condition I might not be 
able to hold up long enough to keep 
us all safe. I think it is going to 
have to be your first regal act.” 

‘‘Then you are going to have to 
show me how to work it. I thought 
we needed a Pattern to perform the 
attunement.” 

“I think not. Brand indicated that 
a person who was already attuned 
could attune another. I have given it 
some thought since then, and I be- 
lieve I know how to go about it. 
Let’s get off to one side some- 
where.” 

‘‘Okay. Come on.” 

Already something new had come 
into his voice and posture. The sud- 
den role had begun working its 
change immediately, it seemed. I 
wondered what sort of king and 
queen he and Vialle would beome. 
Too much. My mind felt disas- 
sociated. Too much had happened 
too recently. I could not contain all 
of the latest events in one big piece 
of thinking. I just wanted to crawl 
off somewhere and sleep around the 
clock. Instead, I followed him to a 
place where a small cooking fire 
still smouldered. 

He poked at the fire and tossed a 
handful of sticks onto it. Then he 
seated himself close to it and nod- 
ded to me. I went over and sat 
down beside him. 

“About this king business,” he 
said. “What am I going to do, 
Corwin? It caught me totally unpre- 
pared.” 

“Do? Probably a very good 
job,” I replied. 

“Do you think there were many 
hard feelings?” 

“If there were, they did not 
show,” I said. “You were a good 



choice, Random. So much has hap- 
pened recently . Dad sheltered 
us actually, maybe more than was 
good for us. The throne is ob- 
viously no plum. You have a lot of 
hard work ahead of you. I think the 
others have come to realize this.” 

“And yourself?” 

“I wanted it only because Eric 

did. I did not realize it at the time, 
but it is true. It was the winning 
counter in a game we had been 
playing across the years. The end of 
a vendetta, really. And I would 
have killed him for it. I am glad 
now that he found another way to 

die. We were more alike"lhan we 
were different, he and I. I did not 
realize that until much later either. 
But after his death, I kept finding 
reasons for not taking the throne. 
Finally it dawned on me that it was 
not really what I wanted. No. You 
are welcome to it. Rule well, 
brother. I am sure that you will.” 

“If Amber still exists,” he said 
after a time, “I will' try. Come, let 
us be about this business with the 
Jewel. That storm is getting uncom- 
fortably near.” 

I nodded and took the stone from 
his fingers. I held it by its chain 
with the fire behind it. The light 
came through; its insides seemed 
clear. “Lean closer and stare into. 
the Jewel with me,” I directed. 

He did this, and while we both 
regarded the stone, I told him, 
“Think of the Pattern,” and I 
commenced thinking of it myself, 
trying to summon to mind its loops 
and swirls, its palely glowing lines. 

I seemed to detect a slight flaw 
near to the stone’s center. I consid- 
ered it as I thought upon the twist- 
ings, the turns, the Veils ... I im-

agined the current which swept 
through me every time I essayed 
that complex way. 

The imperfection in the stone 
grew more distinct. 

I lay my will upon it, summoning 
it into fullness, clarity. A familiar 
feeling came over me as this occur- 
red. It was that which had taken me 
on the day I had attuned myself to 
the Jewel. I only hoped that I was 
strong enough now to go through 
the experience once again. 

I reached out and clasped Ran- 
dom by the shoulder. 

“What do you see?” I asked 
him. 

“Something like the Pattern,” he 
said, “only it seems to be three- 
dimensional. It lies at the bottom of 
a red sea . .” 

“Come with me then,” 1 said. 
“We must go to it.” 

Again that feeling of movement, 
drifting at first, then falling with in- 
creasing velocity toward the never- 
fully seen sinuosities of the Pattern 
within the Jewel. I willed us ahead, 
feeling my brother’s presence beside 
me, and the ruby glow which sur- 
rounded us darkened, becoming the 
blackness of a clean night sky. This 
special Pattern grew with each 
thudding heartbeat. Somehow the 
process seemed easier than it had 
before — perhaps because I was al- 
ready attuned. 

Feeling Random beside me, I 
drew him along as that familiar 
shape grew and its starting point 
became apparent. As we were 
moved in that direction, I once 
again tried to encompass the totality 
of this Pattern and was lost, once 
more in what seemed its extra- 
dimensional convolutions. Great 



curves and spirals and knotted- 
seeming traceries wound before us. 
The sense of awe I had felt earlier 
swept over me, and from some- 
where nearby I was aware of this in 
Random, also. 

We progressed to the section of 
the beginning and were swept into 
it. There was a shimmering bright- 
ness all about us, flashed through 
with sparks, as we were woven into 
the matrix of light. This time my 
mind was entirely abosrbed by the 
process and Paris seemed far 
away .... 

A subsconscious memory re- 
minded me of the more difficult 
sections, and here I employed my 
desire — my will, if you like — to 
hurry us along the dazzling route, 
recklessly drawing strength from 
Random to accelerate the process. 

It was as if we negotiated the 
luminous interior of an enormous 
and elaborately convoluted seashell. 
Only our passage was soundless, 
and we ourselvgs disembodied 
points of sentience. 

Our velocity seemed to increase 
constantly, as did a mental aching I 
did not recall from the previous 
traversal of the design. Perhaps it 
was related to my fatigue, or to my 
efforts to hurry things so. We 
crashed through the barriers; we 
were surrounded by steady, flowing 
walls of brightness. I felt myself 
growing faint, dizzy, now. But I 
could not afford the luxury of un- 
consciousness, nor could I permit us 
to move more slowly with the storm 
as near as I remembered it. Again, 
regretfully, I drew strength from 
Random — this time just to keep us 
in the game. We sped ahead. 

This time I did not experience the 

127 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 




tingling, fiery sensation of somehow 
being shaped. It must have been an 
effect of my attunement. My previ- 
ous passage through it might have 
rendered me some small immunity 
in this regard. 

After a timeless interval, it 
seemed that I felt Random falter. 
Perhaps I represented too great a 
drain upon his energies. I began to 
wonder whether I would leave him 
with sufficient strength to manipu- 
late the storm if I leaned upon him 
any further. I resolved not to draw 
upon his resources any more than I 
already had. We were well along 
the way. He should be able to con- 
tinue without me, if it came to that. 
I would simply have to hang on as 
best I could now. Better for me to 
be lost here than both of us. 

We swept on, my senses rebel- 
ling, the dizziness recurring. I set 
my will to our progress and forced 
everything else from my mind. It 
seemed we were nearing the ter- 
minus when a darkening began 
which I knew was not a part of the 
experience. I fought down panic. 

It was no good. I felt myself 
slipping away. So close! I was cer- 
tain we were almost finished. It 
would be so easy to — 

Everything swam away from me. 
My last sensation was a knowledge 
of Random’s concern. 

★ ★ ★ 



It was flickering orange and red 
between my feet. Was I trapped in 
some astral hell? I continued to 
stare as my mind slowly cleared. 
The light was surrounded by dark- 
ness and .... 



There were voices, familiar .... 

Things cleared. I was lying on 
my back, feet toward a campfire.. 

“It is all right, Corwin. It is all 
right.” 

It was Fiona who had spoken. I 
turned my head. She was seated on 
the ground above me. 

“Random. ?” I said. 

“He is all right, also — Father.” 

Merlin was seated off to the 
right. 

“What happened?” 

“Random bore you back,” Fiona 
said. 

“Did the attunement work?” 

“He thinks so.” 

I struggled to sit up. She tired to 
push me back, but I sat up anyway. 

“Where is he?” 

She gestured with her eyes. 

I looked and I saw Random. He 
was standing with his back to us 
about thirty meters away, on a shelf 
of rock, facing the storm. It was 
very close now, and a wind whip- 
ped his garments. Lightning trails 
crissed and crossed before him. The 
thunder boomed almost constantly. 

“How long — has he been there?” 
I asked. 

“Only a few minutes,” Fiona re- 
plied. 

“That is how long it has been — 
since our return?” 

“No,” she said. “You have been 
out for a fairly long while. Random 
talked with the others first, then or- 
dered a troop withdrawal. Benedict 
has taken them all to the black 
road. They are crossing over.” 

I turned my head. 

There was movement along the 
black road, a dark column heading 
out toward the citadel. Gossamer 
strands drifted between us; there 



128 



GALAXY 




were a few sparks at the far end, 
about the nighted hulk. Overhead, 
the sky had completely reversed it- 
self, with us beneath the darkened 
half. Again I felt that strange feel- 
ing of having been here long, long 
ago, to see that this, rather than 
Amber, was the true center of crea- 
tion. I grasped after the ghost of a 
memory. It vanished. 

I searched the lightning- shot 
gloom about me. 

“All of them — done?” I said to 
her. “You, me, Merlin, Ran- 
dom — we’re the only ones left 
here?” 

“Yes,” Fiona said. “Do you 
wish to follow them now?” 

I shook my head. 

“I am staying here with Ran- 
dom.” 

“I knew you would say that.” 

I got to my feet as she did. So 
did Merlin. She clapped her hands 
and a white horse came ambling up 
to her. 

“You have no further need for 
my ministrations,” she said. “So I 
will go and join the others in the 
Courts of Chaos. There are horses 
for you tethered by those rocks.” 
She gestured. “Are you coming, 
Merlin?” 

“I will stay with my father, and 
the king.” 

“So be it. I hope to see you there 
soon.” 

“Thanks, Fi,” I said. 

I helped her to mount and 
watched her ride off. 

I went over and sat down by the 
fire again. I watched Random, who 
stood unmoving, facing the storm. 

“There are plenty of rations and 
wine,” Merlin said. “May I fetch 
you some?” 



“Good idea.” 

The storm was so close that 1 
could have walked down to it in a 
couple of minutes. I could not tell 
yet whether Random’s efforts were 
having any effect. I sighed heavily 
and let my mind drift. 

Over. One way or another, all of 
my efforts since Greenwood were 
over. No need for revenge any 
longer. No. We had an intact Pat- 
tern, maybe even two. The cause of 
all our troubles. Brand, was dead. 
Any residuum of my curse was 
bound to be wiped out by the mas- 
sive convulsions sweeping through 
Shadow. And I had done my best to 
make up for it. I had found a friend 
in my father and come to terms 
with him as himself before his de- 
ath. We had a new king, with the 
apparent blessing of the unicorn, 
and we had pledged him our loy- 
alty. It seemed sincere to me. I was 
reconciled with my entire family. I 
felt that I had done my duty. Noth- 
ing drove me now. I had run out of 
causes and was as close as I might 
ever be to peace. With all this be- 
hind me, I felt that if I had to die 
now, it was all right. I would not 
protest quite so loudly as I would 
have at any other time. 

“You are far from here, Father.” 

I nodded, then smiled. I accepted 
some food and began eating. As I 
did, I watched the storm. Still too 
early to be certain, but it seemed 
that it was no longer advancing. 

I was too tired to sleep. Or some- 
thing like that. My aches had all 
subsided and a wondrous numbness 
had come over me. I felt as if I 
were embedded in warm cotton. 
Events and reminiscences kept the 
mental clockwork turning within 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS 



129 




me. It was, in many ways, a deli- 
cious feeling. 

I finished eating and built up the 
fire. I sipped the wine and watched 
the storm, like a frosted window set 
before a fireworks display. Life felt 
good. If Random succeeded in pul- 
ling this one off, I would be riding 
into the Courts of Chaos tomorrow. 
What might await me there, I could 
not tell. Perhaps it might be a 
gigantic trap. An ambush. A trick. I 
dismissed the thought. Somehow, 
right now, it did not matter. 

“You had begun telling me of 
yourself, Father.” 

“Had I? I do not recall what I 
said.” 

“I would like to get to know you 
better. Tell me more.” 

I made a popping noise with my 
lips and shrugged. 

“Then this.” He gestured. “This 
whole conflict. How did it get 
started? What was your part in it? 
Fiona told me that you had dwelled 
in Shadow for many years without 
your memory. How did you get it 
back and locate the others, and re- 
turn to Amber?” 

I chuckled. I regarded Random 
and the storm once more. I took a 
drink of wine and drew up my 
cloak against the wind. 

“Why not?” I said then. “If 
you’ve a stomach for long stories, 
that is ... I suppose that the best 
place to begin is at Greenwood Pri- 
vate Hospital, on the shadow Earth 
of my exile. Yes . .” 

XIV. 

The sky turned, and turned 
again as I spoke. Standing against 
the storm, Random prevailed. It 



broke before us, parting as if cloven 
by a giant’s axeblade. It rolled back 
at either hand, finally sweeping off 
to the north and the south, fading, 
diminishing, gone. The landscape it 
had masked endured, and with it 
went the black road. Merlin tells me 
that this is no problem, though, for 
he will summon a strand of 
gossamer when the time comes for 
us to cross over. 

Random is gone now. The strain 
upon him was immense. In repose, 
he no longer looked as once he 
did — the brash younger brother we 
delighted in tormenting — for there 
were lines upon his face which I 
had never noticed before, signs of 
some depth to which I had paid no 
heed. Perhaps my vision has been 
colored by recent events, but he 
seemed somehow nobler and 
stronger. Does a new role work 
some alchemy? Appointed by the 
unicom, annointed by the storm, it 
seems that he had indeed assumed a 
kingly mien, even in slumber. 

I have slept — even as Merlin now 
dozes — and it pleases me to be, for 
this brief while before his awaken- 
ing, the only spot of sentience on 
this crag at the rim of Chaos, look- 
ing back upon a surviving world, a 
world that has been scoured, a 
world which endures .... 

We may have missed Dad’s fu- 
neral, his drifting into some name- 
less place beyond the Courts. Sad, 
but I lacked the strength to move. 
And yet, I have seen the pageant of 
his passing, and I bear much of his 
life within me. I have said my 
good-byes. He would understand. 
And good-bye, Eric. After all this 
time I say it, in this way. Had you 
lived so long, it would have been 



130 



GALAXY 




over between us. We might even 
one day have become friends, all 
our cases for strife passed. Of them 
all, you and I were more alike than 
any other pair within the family. 
Save, in some ways, Deirdre and 
myself ... but tears on this count 
were shed long ago. Good-bye 
again, though, dearest sister, you 
will always live somewhere in my 
heart. 

And you, Brand . with bitter- 
ness do I regard your memory, mad 
brother. You almost destroyed us. 
You nearly toppled Amber from her 
lofty perch on the breast of Kolvir. 
You would have shattered all of 
Shadow. You almost broke the Pat- 
tern and redesigned the universe in 
your own image. You were mad 
and evil, and you came so close to 
realizing your desires that I tremble 
even now. I am glad that you are 
gone, that the arrow and the abyss 
have claimed you, that you sully no 
more the places of men with your 
presence nor walk in the sweet airs 
of Amber. I wish that you had 
never been bom and failing that, 
that you had died sooner. Enough! 
It diminishes me to reflect so. Be 
dead and trouble my thinking no 
more. 

I deal you out like a hand of 
cards, my brothers and sisters. It is 
painful as well as self-indulgent to 
generalize like this, but you, 
1 — we — seem to have changed, and 
before I move into the traffic again, 
I require a final look. 

Caine, I never liked you and I 
still do not trust you. You have in- 
sulted me, betrayed me and even 
stabbed me. Forget that. I do not 
like your methods, though I cannot 
fault your loyalty this time around. 



Peace, then. Let the new reign 
begin with a clean slate between us. 

Llewella, you possess reserves of 
character the recent situation did not 
call upon you to exercise. For this, 
I am grateful. It is sometimes pleas- 
ant to emerge from a conflict un- 
tested. 

Bleys, you are still a figure clad 
in light to me — valiant, exuberant 
and rash. For the first, my respect; 
for the second, my smile. And the 
last seems to have at least been 
tempered in recent times. Good. 
Stay away from conspiracies in the 
future. They do not suit you well. 

Fiona, you have changed the 
most. I must substitute a new feel- 
ing for an old one, princess, as we 
have become for the first time 
friends. Take my fondness, sor- 
ceress. I owe you. 

Gerard, slow, faithful brother, 
perhaps we have not all changed. 
You stood rock-like and held to 
what you believed. May you be less 
easily gulled. May I never wrestle 
you again. Go down to your sea in 
your ships and breathe the clean salt 
air. 

Julian, Julian, Julian ... is it 
that I never really knew you? No. 
Arden’s green magic must have sof- 
tened that old vanity during my 
long absence, leaving a juster pride 
and something I would fain call 
fairness — a thing apart from mercy, 
to be sure, but an addition to your 
armory of traits I’ll not disparage. 

And Benedict, the gods know 
you grow wiser as time bums its 
way to entropy, yet you still neglect 
single examples of the species in 
your knowledge of people. Perhaps 
I’ll see you smile now this battle’s 
done. Rest, warrior. 



THE COURTS OF CHAOS

Flora . charity, they say, be- 
gins at home. You seem no worse 
now than when I knew you long 
ago. It is but a sentimental dream to 
regard you and the others as I do, 
totting up my balance sheets, look- 
ing for credits. We are not enemies, 
any of us, now, and that should be 
sufficient. 

And the man clad in black and 
silver with a silver rose upon him? 
He would like to think that he has 
learned something of trust, that he 
has washed his eyes in some clear 
spring, that he has polished an ideal 
or two. Never mind. He may still 
be only a smart-mouthed meddler, 
skilled mainly in the minor art of 
survival, blind as ever the dungeons 
knew him to the finer shades of 
irony. Never mind, let it go, let it 
be. I may never be pleased with 
him. 

Carmen, voulez-vous venir avec 
moi? No? Then good-bye to you 
too, Princess of Chaos. It might 
have been fun. 

The sky is turning once more, 
and who can say what deeds its 
stained-glass light might shine 
upon? The solitaire has been dealt 
and played. Where there had been 
nine of us, now there are seven and 
one king. Yet Merlin and Martin 
are with us, new players in the on- 
going game. 

My strength returns as I stare into 
the ashes and consider the path I 
have taken. The way ahead in- 
trigues me, from hell to hallelujah. 
I have back my eyes, my memories, 
my family. And Corwin will always 
be Corwin, even on judgment day. 

Merlin is stirring now, and this is 
good. It is time to be about. There 
are things to do. 

132 



Random’s last act after defeating 
the storm was to join with me, 
drawing power from the Jewel, to 
reach Gerard through his Trump. 
They are cold once more, the cards, 
and the shadows are themselves 
again. Amber stands. Years have 
passed since we departed it, and 
more may elapse before I return. 
The others may already have 
trumped home, as Random has 
done, to take up his duties. But I 
must visit the Courts of Chaos now, 
because I said that I would, because 
I may even be needed there. 

We ready our gear now, Merlin 
and I, and soon he will summon a 
wispy roadway. 

When all is done in that place, 
and when Merlin has walked his 
Pattern and gone to claim his 
worlds, there is a journey that I 
must make. I must ride to the place 
where I planted the limb of old 
Ygg, visit the tree it has grown to. I 
must see what has become of the 
Pattern I drew to the sound of pi- 
geons on the Champs-Elysees. If it 
leads me to another universe, as I 
now believe it will, I must go there, 
to see how I have wrought. 

The roadway drifts before us, ris- 
ing to the Courts in the distance. 
The time has come. We mount and 
move forward. 

We are riding now across the 
blackness on a road that looks like 
cheesecloth. Enemy citadel, con- 
quered nation, trap, ancestral 
home ... we shall see. There is a 
faint flickering from battlement and 
balcony. We may even be in time 
for a funeral. I straighten my back 
and I loosen my blade. We will be 
there before much longer. 

Good-bye and hello, as always. ★

They knew the man 
was crazy — but then, 
so was the job they 
wanted him for! 

Footsteps. Virgil Grissom Kinney 
spent so much time in the cream- 
white room that he could detect 
sounds through the baffling and the 
soundproofing. 

Two of them. Marsface’ s familiar 
step, favoring his right leg where I 
bit him once so long ago, shuffles 
and stomps through the floor pad- 
ding at the limits of hearing. 

The other set of footsteps was un- 
familiar. Light, even, quick. 

Probably Death’s Angel coming 
to get me after having tea and bis- 
cuits with Marsface and the Master 
Snoop. Probably coming because 
Master Snoop knows I’ve figured a 
way out. I can hear both of them up 
there sometimes, and the Master 
Snoop, their machinery watching, 
listening, monitoring, recording 
every movement of every cell in 
my — wha? Oh, yeah — the door. 
They’re here. 

The door appeared in a section of 
padding and opened inward. Mental 
Health Technician William Bear- 
claw, clipboard and scrimsheet in 
hand, pointed to Virgil. The woman 
gazed at the wrapped body and 
shook her head. 

Marsface. I knew it, didn’t I? 
Same Marsface — red, round head 
with its craters and gorges and 
mole-mountains. But Death Angel 
doesn’t look like he’s supposed to. 
Why is he wearing a print dress? 
Master Snoop’s trying to screw me 



up. It won't work. I know how to 
get out and I don’t need them. 
They’re talking in their language 
again. Got to concentrate and break 
their code. It’ll give me a clue. 

“Yes, Ms. Double, he’s — ’’ 

“Double. Accent grave over the 
e.” 

“Yes, Miz. You can see the 
lengths we had to go to restrain 
him. A man can kill himself against 
a padded wall if he keeps pounding 
it every moment. He dies of exhaus- 
tion and dehydration.” 

“His class?” 

“Psychotic, with a good dose of 
manic-depressive, although I’ve 
never seen him manic. Duodrugs 
have no effect on him. The Phar- 
maceutics are mystified but I think 
Virgil here has a multiple personal- 
ity. We can drug one or two or 
three of them but he always has one 
that surfaces unaffected.” He 
looked worried. “Don’t tell anyone 
though. It’s not a very sound 
theory. The drugs should act on the 
brain, not the mind.” 

The woman stepped closer to 
Virgil and looked into his eyes, al- 
most the only part of his body not 
wrapped in restraining sheets. He 
lay near the center of the room, on 
his side, resembling a white inch- 
worm. He did not move except to 
follow her with his green eyes. A 
curl of sweaty, greasy blond hair 
hung over one eyebrow. Reaching 
out, the woman brushed it away 
from his eyelid. 

What’s she trying? To claw inside 
my head? I want to die on my own, 
damn it. I’ve got my escape mapped 
out. No, musn't think about it. Mas- 
ter Snoop, fuck you. Black hair fall- 
ing to her shoulders and wrapping

like snakes around her near-white 
throat. Isn’t she afraid it’ll strangle 
her? Stupid — Death Angel doesn't 
have to fear its master. Snoop? But 
I’ve never heard her upstairs. 
Stupid again — she must’ve been 
barefoot and walking with pregnant 
pause. 

“If the Feds were still around, 
he’d be certifiable. As it is, he’s 
here because an insurance policy he 
filed a long time ago had an 
insanity-care clause.’’ 

“Insanity? Is that chestnut com- 
ing back? What happened to Reality 
Premises and Szaszian therapy? 
You’re keeping him against his 
will, aren’t you?” Indignation made 
her stand straighten 

“Yes, Ms. Double. But the cir- 
cumstances are very unusual. The 
patient likes to commit suicide. 
He’s tried it about seven times that 
we know of. But he’s not like most 
suiciders that can be left alone or 
that the churches get. His attempts 
have always involved massive prop- 
erty damage and danger to others.” 
“Never touched a SeppukuKit?” 
“His mind doesn’t run in those 
directions. He’d make a great 
daredevil but he’d keep forgetting to 
pull the ripcord and would land in 
the grandstands. That kind of 
suicider. Are you sure you can use 
him? I’ll give you his complete file 
first.” 

“I’ll take him. And the file.” 
She held out her hand. Taking the 
thin viewscrim, she slipped it into 
her notebook and then frowned. 
“But who put him in your care in 
the first place?” 

“His insurance company. His last 
attempt ruined about a kilauro worth 
of property and killed a young girl. 



Her parents sued and the insurance 
company paid off. And then paid 
for his perpetual care. 

“He’s a threat, Miz. He won’t 
kill himself by refusing to eat but 
he’ll do anything that’ll damage 
himself and as many material items 
as possible. The behavior mod 
doesn’t work and none of us have 
ever gotten him to say anything.” 

“The Brennen Trust has a place 
for him.” 

“I hope so, Ms. Double.” 

Death Angel and Marsface walk 
out goodbye. My plan's almost 
ready anyway. I’ll meet the Night- 
sheet on my own terms. If only I 
had a match or could scratch my 
butt. Hatch my gut. Stupid. 

★ ★ ★ 

Virgil’s eyes opened after they 
had closed and the room changed. 
His body trembled inside the sheets. 

I did it! It worked and I didn't 
even have to think about it. Free! 
Almost. Why did 1 bring the sheets 
with me? Stupid — they were too 
close to you. I’ll get out, though. 
Did Master Snoop follow me? Don’t 
know. Too noisy. Am I in their con- 
trol room? Did I escape right into 
their clutches? Shit. 

“He’s awake, Dee.” The graying 
Pharmaceutic sat near a bank of in- 
dicators flashing red, green and tur- 
quoise. Dee Double needed no 
brain-wave machines to see him 
open his eyes. He lay on a wide 
table with raised edges, his body 
white and mummy-like against the 
soft black leather. The portions of 
the walls that had no machinery 
showed a soothing brown wood 
paneling.

Lights! Sounds ! Operators! I blew 
it. Right in with the Master Snoop. 
Death Angel too. It makes sense 
they wouldn't let Marsface in here; 
they run him too. Damn. 

“He’s looking around, Steve. 
Maybe we should have kept him in 
some sort of white room. Doesn’t 
matter. 1 don’t think he’s as out of 
it as Duolab thought. Get the injec- 
tion ready.” 

Dee Double looked closer at the 
prone body. “Virgil Grissom Kin- 
ney,” she said. The eyes riveted 
hers. “Good. Virgil, I’m going to 
give you your choice. You were 
never given any choices at Duolab 
and now I’m going to give you one. 
Do you understand?” 

Death Angel hovers over me as I 
lie in my coffin. Stupid coffin with 
no lid. Soft pink lips move and I 
can almost break her code. Words 
come through the roar. The roaring 
parts a bit and I break her code. 
She wants something. I’ll go along 
with it. The roar's never been bro- 
ken before. Break the roar and I 
can crack her code. Take it easy. 

“Good. Virgil, they tell me you 
like to kill yourself.” 

She knows about them! But she 
must. She’s one of them. Remember 
that. You’ve cracked her code, 
maybe you can crack theirs. The 
roar’s less now. 

“I’m going to offer you a choice. 
I have two injections here. One is a 
poison that will kill you in a matter 
of seconds. The other will help 
you.” 

Two bottles. One liter black with 
skull and crossbones. One white 
with a yellow smile face. She 
placed them on a table out of Vir- 
gil’s view. 



“Blink your eyes once for the 
poison or twice for the other.” 

“Fff — ” 

“What?” blurted Double. 
“Steve, he’s trying to talk!” 

“Loosen his neck a bit.” She did 
so, using bandage scissors to snip 
away the fabric. Saliva dripped 
down his chin. 

“Fff. .fuh. .false dichotomy.” 

The sound startled her; the scis- 
sors dropped to the floor noisily. 

“I think that means he doesn’t 
want either injection.” The old man 
smiled wickedly and watched the 
woman. 

“Well,” she said, turning back 
to Virgil, “it wouldn’t have mat- 
tered anyway because I would have 
switched labels to make sure you 
got what was in this one.” She held 
up the bottle with the smile face. 
“The other one’s empty.” She 
hung the bottle over his head. 

“Now, Virgil, I’m going to in- 
ject you, false dichotomy or not. 
The firm I represent has bought out 
the premium on your insurance so, 
in effect, we own you. We’ve 
bailed you out and you’re going to 
pay us off. Or did you want to stay 
locked up forever?” 

What’s her game? I get it. I may 
have cracked her cipher but not her 
code. I know what she’s saying but 
not what she means. If I could get 
out of my room, maybe I can get 
out of this one too. Three, four, five 
times l can try. 

He nodded as far as his swathing 
allowed, then stopped and shook his 
head back and forth. 

“Do you want to say anything 
else?” His head shook a no. 

“Administer, Steve.” 

The old man stood up and pre- 



DEATH'S DIMENSIONS 



137 




pared a needle. One patch of Vir- 
gil’s body other than his face lay 
open and exposed — the injection 
port in his right wrist. Steve pushed 
the blunted needle into the plastic 
valve surgically sewn and laser- 
welded to skin and vein. The needle 
clicked into place. Clear serum 
from the bottle overhead trickled 
slowly through the plastic tube. 
Somewhere a camera’s zoom lens ro- 
tated, closing in for facial reaction. 
The electronic measuring devices 
mused to themselves, recording. 

It’s not working. Whatever 
they’re trying, it’s failing. I don’t 
feel any different. Should l tell 
them, gloat-gloat? No. Play along. 
If I can escape, I can get away. 
Find something to get Master Snoop 
and Nightsheet at once. Drop a 
tanker on them. Okay. 

“What you’re getting, Virgil, is 
a mixture of distilled water and 
ribonucleic acid. Ever heard of it?” 
Virgil shook his head. “Memory 
juice. Every living thing has it. 
You’re getting the memories of a 
man who did something. We want 
to know why he did it. You won’t 
be able to tell us but when he died, 
he had things in his head that take a 
long time to teach and we’re just 
cutting comers because we’re in a 
hurry.” She paused. 

Virgil nodded nervously, a trickle 
of sweat running down his brow. 

They're filling me up with some- 
one else’s brain! Maybe I can get 
him to help me. But I don’t hear 
him. The roar is coming back. I’m 
losing her cipher. Back. Focus. 
They’re trying to make it hard for 
me. I’ll get out. There. Less 
roar, and her cipher’s broken again. 

“Would you like to know what 



we know about you?” He nodded 
carefully. “Good. Shake your head 
if you don’t remember anything I 
read.” 

She slipped the top of the scrim 
into her clipboard and signaled the 
first page. It appeared in dark gray 
letters against a light gray 
background. 

“You are Virgil Grissom Kinney. 
You are thirty-four years old. Oh, 
you didn’t know that? It’s twenty- 
one seven. March fifth.” His eyes 
widened. “You’ve been interned for 
twelve years, ever since you tried to 
kill yourself by flying into the 
TransAmerica Pyramid. Luckily for 
all but one person, a Monroe gust 
caught your flyer and flipped it into 
a power dive into Market Street, 
You killed a three-year-old girl.” 
Virgil shook his head. “Well, you 
did. They — your insurance com- 
pany, that is — settled with the par- 
ents and the streetowners for com- 
pensation on the stipulation that you 
receive perpetual care.” She 
glanced through the next few pages, 
then shut off the scrim. “I em- 
phasized tried to kill yourself be- 
cause I think you don’t really want 
to die. Do you?” 

“Off the scale,” said Steve, reach- 
ing to reset a meter, “whatever 
that means. That’s a key question.” 

She nodded. “But if you don’t 
want to die, why do you keep try- 
ing? Publicity hound? But three of 
your attempts were in out-of-the- 
way spots: your snowmobile at Os- 
trander Lake, your powersuit 
against El Capitan, another power- 
suit against Mount Rushmore. You 
were found each time before you 
were dead but,” she shrugged, 
“I’m not interested in your luck.”

She turned to Steve and whispered, 
“Begin sublimins.” 

They’re doing something. 

“You were an economist, 
weren’t you?” 

Virgil nodded tentatively. 

“Then you’ll find some of the 
things you’ll leam easy to under- 
stand. Just think of physics as the 
economics of efficient atomic ac- 
tion. Now — all atomic particles are 
composed of the following bounded 
energy quanta. ...” 

* * * 

Three days. Three days and / still 
don’t understand her code. I’ve got 
her cipher figured out. The physics 
of space travel. I don’t remember 
thinking much about space flight be- 
fore they caught me. There was the 
Earthrope’ s launch and its getting 
lost and all that when I was a kid. 
But what’s this about teleportation? 
I thought I was the only one who 
could do that , and / didn’t even 
know I did it when I did it and / 
haven’t done it since. I've tried to 
leave this room like I left the last 
one but it’s no good. You’ve got to 
try. Or maybe you should go along 
with them until you find how they 
teleport. Here she comes again. 
Death Angel in a clean white lab 
coat. 

“Virgil. I hope you’re feeling 
well today. I’m going to unwrap 
you. It’s going to hurt and it will be 
physically dangerous to you. If you 
aren’t careful, you may die. If you 
want to die, I can’t stop you.” 

She removed the waste-cycling 
tube that connected to another tube 
taped to his thigh and set it aside. 
Large bandage scissors went to 



work, first on his head. 

“How long-has it been since they 
changed these? A week? Two?” A 
shock of wet, yellow hair was re- 
vealed on his head when she pulled 
the sheet away. 

“Thanks.” 

She started. Regaining compo- 
sure, she continued snipping away. 
“Three words in as many days. 
That’s something.” 

Maybe she's not working for 
Master Snoop. Could she be a free 
agent? Maybe Master Snoop and 
Night sheet aren’t in cahoots any 
more. I need more information. 
Stupid. 

An arm fell limply to the couch. 
Atrophied and deathly white, its 
fingers twitched weakly. The other 
arm was the same except for a burn 
scar running its length. His chest 
heaved when freed from the 
restraints. 

“Don’t,” she warned. “You’ll 
hyperventilate.” Carefully she cut 
the cloth away from his waist and 
thighs. “Well, you’re a real blond, 
all right.” 

She jumped back when he 
laughed and tried to drag his hands 
toward his crotch. 

His arms wavered about 
helplessly, bouncing off the side of 
the black leather couch and coming 
to rest on his flat, muscleless 
stomach. She clipped the bindings 
around his legs, removed the rest of 
the waste tubes and then stared 
thoughtfully at the pitifully thin 
body before her. 

“You go on solids tomorrow. 
And you begin training.” 

“And if I don’t want to?” A 
sneer flashed palely across his lips 
for a second. 



DEATH'S DIMENSIONS 



139 




“Thank God,” she whispered. 
.Then, louder: “Here’s a scalpel. 
You can slash your wrists right now 
or I’ll do it for you. Or you can kill 
me and try to escape. There’s a 
limitless number of possibilities.. 
But you don’t go in for real suicide 
and I don’t think you’d ever kill 
anyone intentionally.” 

“You cut my wrists.” 

His image swam before her. She 
shook her head. Failure, she 
thought, after all this. Or maybe 
he's just bluffing. She took the 
scalpel from his open fingers and 
held it over the pulsing blue veins 
on his scarred right wrist. / can't go 
through with this. It’s murder. Say 
stop, damn you! 

He watched the bright sliver of 
metal touch his skin. She means it! 

“No!” His head fell back against 
the couch. 

She dropped the scalpel on a tray 
and sat down. Better ask it now. 
“Why don’t you want to die?” 
“Nobody wants to die.” 

“But you keep trying to. Why?” 
She’s making the roar come 
back. Get her back. “What’s your 
name?” 

“Dee.” 

“Your whole name.” 

“None of your business. It’s a 
dumb name.” 

He picked up the scalpel from the 
tray and brought it to his veins. 

She hesitated for an instant. “No! 
Okay, you win this one. My name 
is Double. Diehla Double. And 
forget the obvious jokes. My par- 
ents had a sick sense of humor. 
And there’s an accent grave over 
the e." 

“Accent acute. Did you spring 
me just to give me a physics 



course?” 

Remarkable! Or is it? Maybe he 
just didn't like being wrapped up 
for a decade or so. “You’ve ad- 
justed well to your new surround- 
ings.” Must be the RNA from Jord. 
“You’re here because Brennen 
Trust made a mistake. With a man 
named Jord Baker. You’ve been 
given some preliminary theoretical 
data on the concept of interstellar 
travel. The RNA injections and sub- 
liminal instruction — ” 

Aha! 

“ — have also stored inside you ev- 
erything Jord Baker knew. When 
testing time comes, you’ll be re- 
membering things you never learned 
before. You’ll probably remember 
things right now as I talk. This is 
just about the only way to bring 
them to the surface to be refiled in 
other parts of your mind. 

“Jord Baker was a test pilot for 
the Brennen Trust. He was testing 
out the concept of teleportation 
when he decided to kill himself. Let 
me backtrack a bit. 

“Ten years ago some scientist 
came up with a mathematically prov- 
able theory of fourth-dimensional 
travel. Two years ago the Brennen 
Trust’s technicians, studying some- 
thing completely different — non- 
destructive testing of ferrous alloys, 
I think — accidentally teleported a 
piece of steel three meters. It ap- 
peared in midair, which was fortu- 
nate because the resulting small 
explosion killed only one man — 
which was unfortunate because that 
man was the inventor of the pro- 
cess. It didn’t matter, though, be- 
cause we’ve improved on the device 
through experiments at Colony 
Four. 



140 



GALAXY 




“We finally built a small ship 
that could teleport itself. And the 
method requires no receiving sta- 
tion. It’s not really teleportation, 
but a dimensional concept. I don’t 
have a drawing scrim, but imagine 
a line. Every point on that line can 
be reached from a two-dimensional 
plane without having to go through 
any other points on that line. Simi- 
larly, any point on a plane can be 
reached from the third dimension 
without passing through any other 
point on the plane. The same holds 
true for reaching any point in space 
from the fourth dimension. 

“Now, neither I nor Jord nor you 
can handle the math involved in 
Valliardi’s Proof — that scientist I 
was telling you about — but Jord 
could push the right buttons. He 
made the test, traveling from lunar 
orbit to about a million kilometers 
from Jupiter in an instant. Well, it 
was an instant for him but for us he 
was gone for over half an hour. 
And then it was another half hour 
before we received his laser sig- 
nal.” 

She brushed her fingers across 
the black coil of hair wrapped 
around her neck. “Think of it. He 
vanished for thirty-nine minutes to 
us but it seemed instantaneous to 
him. Remember the stories you 
read — well, at least Jord read 
them — about how traveling close to 
the speed of light leads to contrac- 
tions of time? Take a couple of 
years’ ship time to travel to Alpha 
Centauri while the rest of the uni- 
verse ages a dozen? Well, here you 
could go to the same place just like 
that — ” she snapped her fingers, 
” — and the universe would be four 
years older. And you could go to 



the center of the galaxy just as 
fast — for you. The rest of the uni- 
verse will have aged thirty thousand 
years. 

“Think of it. A one-way time 
machine. Make the slightest miscal- 
culation and poof! you’re a hundred 
years into the future, all your 
friends dead and no way to get back 
but to press the button again and 
lose another hundred years or what- 
ever in an instant.” 

“I don’t have any friends,” said 
Virgil, beginning to cry. 

“Oh, no. I’m sorry.” She 
stroked his head gently. “It’s time 
you had a bath.” 

★ ★ ★ 

She won’t do it. She can’t. What 
do / know about things like that? 
Virgil lifted his head and then 
dropped it back to the cushions. He 
had gone along with the exercises 
and the solid foods. Hated one, 
liked the other. He had been getting 
a lot of sun, building up to it in the 
three weeks since he left Duolab. 
He did his exercises on the top of 
the Brennen Trust Building, which 
was located, he discovered, in 
downtown Houston. Every half an 
hour or so he watched the thin trail 
of vapor reach up from the south — 
another launch from Velasco 
Liftpoint. 

The lessons and tests that Dee 
and others had been giving to him 
had been surprisingly easy. He 
knew more than the simple calculus 
given him in college and it all 
seemed to come to him at the mo- 
ment he needed it. 

Pilot a spaceship? I’d be a man 
in the can, really. Just put in the 



DEATH'S DIMENSIONS 



141 




coordinates they give me and punch 
one button. And if I put in the 
wrong coordinates, I appear in 
something solid maybe, and kapow! 
Like an atom bomb. He smiled. 

“It’s today, Virgil.” 

He turned. Double stood in the 
door of the access shaft. Death 
Angel’s hair stays calm in the wind, 
still trying to strangle her throat. 
Stupid. Hair can’t strangle by itself. 
Her gray jumpsuit ruffles loosely, 
her eyes squint in the sun. Lovely 
Death Angel. I know you work for 
Nightsheet. No matter. I prefer 
Nightsheet to Master Snoop. But to 
end them both. 

“The test? I’m ready?” 

“As ready as you’ll ever be.” 
She's right. The roar is almost 
gone. I can crack all ciphers I 
hear. I’ve almost gotten to her code 
too. Funny. I can break the code on 
a computer and know what it means 
when it buzzes and clicks to me but 
I can’t break its cipher. It’s the 
exact opposite with people. 

“All right. Big question — ” He 
wiped a handful of hair from his 
eyes. “Why me? Why someone 
locked up in a Duolab for a dozen 
years? And don’t make it seem like 
you do it every day. I know what 
you had to do to lord’s body to get 
the RNA after he killed himself. 
The fall must have mashed him up 
a bit but you must have turned him 
to strawberry jam to get that stuff.” 
Dee looked at him, considering. 
“Let’s go inside.” 

The lift descended. “We picked 
you because Jord was well-balanced 
mentally and without a hint of al- 
ternate reality premises. When a 
man most people would call normal 
just ups and kills himself — after a 



period of total silence on his 
return — something’s wrong. Jord 
never attempted a suicide in his life. 
Never even thought about it.” 

“That’s not true. He — no, wait. 
Never mind.” Virgil shook his 
head. It’s like having someone else 
inside my head. I remember bare, 
vague snatches of things that aren’ t 
mine. 

“Anyway, we picked you be- 
cause you’ve tried to commit 
suicide several times but never suc- 
ceeded for some reason. You may 
last long enough to give us some 
idea of what’s wrong with the de- 
vice. You don’t have any RNA 
memory of what happened on Jord’s 
flight, do you?” 

“No. He either blanked it out or 
it was too recent an event.” 

“Our floor.” They stepped out 
into the hallway. Velasco lay only a 
short flyer-hop south. 

★ ★ ★ 

The Brennen Trust executive 
shuttle looked tiny compared to the 
freightcraft towering a kilometer or 
so away from the personal space- 
craft field. The stubby rocket pointed 
straight up, already in liftoff posi- 
tion and awaiting Virgil’s arrival. 
The gantry lift ride lasted less than 
a minute. The entrance hatch hung 
open three meters from the blunt 
nose of the ship, less than forty 
meters from the ground. 

Liftoff and orbital insertion went 
smoothly. Virgil grinned strangely 
during liftoff and the period of 
maximum dynamic pressure. He 
had asked for — and gotten — a seat 
by the only porthole available for 
viewing. He talked pleasantly with 



142 



GALAXY 




the passenger who had been 
bumped from the seat. The balding, 
business-suited man was an ac- 
countant on his way to Colony Six for 
a three-week vacation. He would be 
staying at the Sheraton Lagrange. 
They talked economics and praxeol- 
ogy until a buzzer announced their 
arrival at Trans World Spaceline’s 
terminal. Virgil had not looked out 
the window once during the flight. 

The trip to the experimental ship 
had to be made by “taxi” — not 
much more than a tank of hydrogen 
with seats. Virgil sat between the 
pilot and the man who would put 
him into the spacecraft. 

Stupid. It’s not really a spaceship 
hut a dimension ship. Attitude jets, 
yeah, and emergency thrusters, but 
it’s mostly just a needle that finds 
where two pieces of universe fabric 
touch and then pushes itself 
through. And I’ve got a secret. 

The earth hung five thousand 
kilometers over their heads for a 
moment, then shifted suddenly to 
their side as the pilot rolled to align 
them with the attitude of the test 
ship. It was unbelievably small. Virgil 
knew that it was only ten meters 
long and five wide. It seemed like a 
toy, only slightly larger than a fam- 
ily flyer. 

They want me to go to Saturn in 
that! Death Angel serves Nightsheet 
well. This will kill me for sure. But 
I’ve got a secret. He fingered the 
crumpled piece of paper jammed 
into the third finger of his right 
glove and smiled. He watched the 
blues and whites of Earth glitter, re- 
flected from the stubby, wedge- 
shaped device. 

The pilot waited in the taxi, try- 
ing to pick up jabber on a 



shortwave. Virgil noticed the an- 
tenna trailing behind them. Security 
had been surprisingly lax. Frank 
Workman, the assistant, explained. 

“It’s pretty crowded out here. 
Act innocent, play dumb, and ev- 
erybody is too busy to notice you. 
MYOB holds up here as much as 
down there. Maybe more. Up here 
you watch your step with nature and 
with men. It’s a long drop.” 

TWS’s terminal shone unevenly 
about a hundred kilometers away. 
Virgil climbed inside the tight, 
cramped compartment and fastened 
himself into position. Circuits com- 
pleted, the ship came to life. The 
small screen before him glowed. 

“Hello, Virgil. They signaled me 
when you got there. The computer 
is getting its instructions right 
now.” 

“Hi,” he said. Death Angel's 
voice sounds strange in my helmet. 
Frank closes down the hatch and 
bangs on it twice. I wish there were 
people Nightsheet would spare. Air 
hisses in slowly. Now let's see if I 
can get those coordinates out of 
there. 

“Something wrong with your 
glove?” She looks downward, 
probably at her own screen. It looks 
like she's gazing right at my hands. 

“No, just nervous.” Got it. He 
palmed the paper and held it. 
They’ll be watching me all the while 
I’m here. Any attempt to change the 
coordinates and I’m cut off at once. 
But when I'm out in Saturn’s orbit, 
it’s over an hour before I even 
appear — relative to their percep- 
tions. No, wait. An hour for me to 
get there — in their time, but only an 
instant to me; another hour for 
them to get my laser — which I fire 



DEATH'S DIMENSIONS 



143 




in the few minutes near Saturn I 
take to put in the new coordinates; 
followed shortly by me. No time for 
me to get there, none to come 
back — but an hour of their time 
each way. It’ll be as if I'm totally 
out of their control. I could race my 
laser signal back and almost win. 
Come in second, at least. 

So. Give myself a few minutes to 
program my own return coordi- 
nates. They'll get a laser message 
in teleport plus two hours — their 
time — saying that I made it to 
Saturn. A few moments later they 
hear that Duolab has blown up in a 
blinding fireball. Master Snoop 
wiped out once and for all. That’s 
been the hard part — deciding be- 
tween Master Snoop and Night- 
sheet. You knew where Master 
Snoop was but Death Angel was 
only a clue to Nightsheet’ s where- 
abouts. And beside. Master Snoop 
never let me go free and so they're 
guiltier. 

That's her code! Or part of it. 
I'm helping Nightsheet take Master 
Snoop. Maybe then he won’t take 
me. Stupid — he's a winner, takes 
all. Even Death Angel, someday. 

“Prepare for — uh, we never did 
find the right word for this. Trans- 
dimensional insertion is a bit 
wordy. Good luck, Virgil. I’ll see 
you in about two hours, twenty- 
seven minutes. It’ll be only a few 
minutes for you. I don’t think the 
travel time will bother you.” 

“Goodbye, Death Angel.” Be- 
fore she could frown, he pressed the 
glowing “Transfer” button. 

It was supposed to be instantane- 
ous but it felt nothing like an in- 
stant. The tiny space in which he 
sat seemed to shrink even smaller. 



The roar — it’s returning. No — 
different somehow. My legs! Hands. 
I can’t hear myself scream. Hard to 
breathe. Nightsheet, you fooled me. 
Tricked me with threats of murder. 
Blackness closes in, walls hyperbol- 
lix in and outward. My eyes! 
Stupid — 1 fell for it. Corridor: black 
on black. Can’t breathe. Hear my 
blood not flowing, feel my heart not 
beating. The corridor stretches. I’ve 
never gone this far before! They’ve 
always pulled me out. Out of the 
snow, out of the rocks and the 
granite, out of the water, out of the 
glass, out of the brick and pave- 
ment, out of the crushed steel and 
burning plastic. No one to pull me 
out now. 

Death Angel, you seduced me too 
well. I was stupid, stupid. End of 
the corridor. You! Nightsheet took 
you and made you an agent. No, 
Mother, l won't be calm. Yes, I 
know it's soothing. I’m soothed, but 
I don’t want to go! Yes, I see the 
meadows and Susan and the hill 
and Dad and the time I found the 
puppy. I don’t know. You win. You 
all win. It' s soothing. But I wanted 
to — 

I can see myself lying there in a 
half-open space suit. Stupid — there 
aren't any mirrors. It’s like they 
said. I’m really going and I’m not 
sorry. I go. I’m calm. Restful. No. 

No! 

A band of yellow-white stretched 
before him. Below it, Saturn shone, 
gibbous. It drifted away from him 
ever so slowly. As predicted, he 
had retained his intrinsic velocity 
and direction. He sat still, quiet, 
breathing shallowly. 

So that was . it. Jord Baker 
couldn't abandon the ecstasy of 



144 



GALAXY 




death. But I can. The transfer may 
seem instantaneous to cesium clocks 
and quantum mechanics but the 
mind is the last thing left before the 
transfer is total. Maybe that’s it. 
Maybe not. Maybe it’s a form of 
death with rebirth thrown in. 

Virgil's hand trembled; then it 
grew firm as he reached up and 
grasped the laser locking-switch. It 
took several minutes to find the 
earth. His left hand let go of the 
still-crumpled piece of paper. It 
floated, ignored, and wedged be- 
hind the seat. Virgil switched the 
laser on. 

You lose, Nightsheet. And I bet 



you'll lose on the return trip. And 
the other trips I’ll be making. And 
you, Master Snoop, how can you 
keep an eye on me when I can out- 
race you? I’ve won! Finally. 

“This is Virgil Grissom Kinney 
calling Brennen Trust. All systems 
are functioning normal. Am return- 
ing on your prearranged coordi- 
nates. Have information on death of 
Jord Baker. End transmission.” 

He pushed the “Message Re- 
peat” button and waited a few mo- 
ments before reaching toward the 
“Transfer” button. 

I’ll be with you in a short while, 
Diehla. I’ve cracked the code. ★

Tabby: I say, old chap, what are 
you reading? 

Tom: Richard Adams’ new novel. 
It’s all about cruelty to animals. 
Tabby: A noble theme, I must say. 
Tom: Yes, indeed. It’s the story of 
these two dogs — 

Tabby: Dogs? Did you say 

. dogs? 

Tom: Yes. Would you care to read 
it when I’ve finished? 

Tabby: No, thank you. I can’t abide 
ethnic novels. 

Richard adams’ The Plague 
Dogs is a complete mess. One of 
the few books I have read that I can 
say with confidence should never 
have been published as it stands. 
There is one good story in it, an ar- 
ticle, and a couple of essays, but as 
a novel it is so much slush and 
slop.

Its theme is man’s inhumanity to 
animal. Its locale is the rugged 
Lake country of Wordsworth. 
There, amid natural beauty, is an 
animal-research station in which the 
most unnatural horrors are per- 
formed. 

The heroes are a large black dog 
named Rowf and a small terrier 
called Snitter, who often speaks in 
verse. Rowf’s contribution to mod- 
em science consists of being 
drowned repeatedly in a metal tank 
to prove that domesticated animals 
have greater survival potential than 
wild ones. Snitter’s is to have his 
brains scrambled surgically to study 
the effects of obscuring subjective 
and objective perception. 

Needless to say, the dogs are un- 
happy. Rowf has never known any 
other masters than the “white 
coats,” but Snitter has, and he 
would like to find another. The two 
escape. They find themselves 
friendless and starving. They kill a 
sheep. The local people will surely 
hunt them down. 

But they acquire an ally, a “tod” 
(a fox, to us furriners), who teaches 
them how to survive in order to 
keep himself well-fed on mutton. 

Nevertheless, theirs is not to be 
an idyllic life in the wild. The 
stories of the two marauding dogs 
that steal chickens and kill sheep, 
and the involvement of a govern- 
ment agency, attract the attention of 
an unscrupulous tabloid publisher 
who sends in his most unscrupulous 
reporter, Digby Driver, to do what 
he can to embarrass the govern- 
ment. 

The research station refuses to 
admit the dogs are theirs. Digby 
delves. He learns that one of the 



laboratories was doing research on 
bubonic-plague germs and that all 
of the germ-carrying fleas cannot be 
accounted for. He knows perfectly 
well the dogs were not exposed to 
them but he sees the yellow- 
journalism possibilities of the story; 
and so he begins to wage a cam- 
paign for the government to take ac- 
tion against the dogs. A campaign 
that is wholly successful. 

The tale of the two dogs and their 
struggle to survive is interspersed 
then with the story of Digby and his 
victims, many of whom are vic- 
timizes themselves: the scientists, 
the parliamentarians, the locals good 
and bad. 

The only valid story is that of the 
dogs. They are, up to a point, the 
most interesting characters in the 
book. Unfortunately, Adams writes 
a hundred pages beyond that point. 
Everyone else in the novel is less a 
character than a bias, upon whose 
head Adams heaps either affection 
or scorn. 

But even our sympathy for the 
dogs is strained by the pointlessness 
of their situation. Adams wants us 
to be moved by their plight and in- 
dignant toward their persecutors, 
but their escape from the station 
removes them from the arena of 
both. We get repeated scenes of the 
doctors discussing the experiments, 
but then we are returned to the 
fields, where the dogs’ problems are 
considerably different. 

The cold-bloodedness of the sci- 
entists is depicted as subtly as a 
blowtorch, and as for the locals, 
who are not much kinder, their in- 
difference to the strays and their 
hostility to them as sheep-killers are 
understandable.

The advent of Digby Driver is 
completely extraneous to Adams’ 
theme as well. Driver is a kind of 
dark deus ex machina who carries 
the plot off in a not-very-interesting 
direction. The results of his fallaci- 
ous stories and the subsequent in- 
volvement of parliamentary types 
take the story from the slime to the 
ridiculous. 

Nor are the pages and pages of 
travelogue prose about the Lake 
country, although well-written, any 
asset to the theme. The novel could 
have been set anywhere. 

The truth is that the whole mess 
never amounts to anything, either 
thematically or dramatically. The 
dogs go nowhere. The local people, 
who it seems to me could have 
tracked them down easily enough 
had they tried, never try. The polit- 
ical aspects finally result in a call- 
ing out of the army, which is put to 
rout by another deus ex machina so 
contrived and anticlimactic that it de- 
stroys whatever small drama the end 
may have had. 

Somehow Adams might still have 
gotten away with it had he kept to a 
single-minded point of view and 
pursued it ruthlessly: the dogs as the 
good guys and everybody else as a 
pack of rotters. But he tries to be 
fair. Rather than showing the terri- 
ble suffering of laboratory animals, 
he debates the subject among a va- 
riety of characters, each of whom 
makes a brief speech on some as- 
pect of the problem of animal 
abuse. And then disappears. 

Adams realizes there is no simple 
answer to the problem of who 
should decide whether an animal 
experiment is scientifically justified 
or not. He hates them all, but he is 



willing to accept those performed in 
an effort to eliminate disease. On 
the rest he is unclear, and so the 
theme is unclear. 

Consequently The Plague Dogs is 
a 460-page hodgepodge of Adams- 
against-the-world, which amounts to 
neither an effective polemic nor an 
effective novel. 

Freas’ Friezes 

All I know about art is that 1 
know what I like, which is to say, I 
don’t know much about art. And to 
make things worse, my favorite ar- 
tists are Norman Rockwell and An- 
drew Wyeth. Despite these dubious 
credentials, I will not hesitate to say 
that Frank Kelly Freas’ The Art of 
Science Fiction is the best science- 
fiction book of the year and one of 
the greatest books of science fiction 
ever published. 

I have been admiring Freas’ work 
for over twenty years. I used to buy 
Astounding and Analog just to look 
at his illos. And when I stopped 
buying them, 1 still browsed 
through every issue at the news- 
stand. My reaction then is the same 
as it is today: O-o-o-o, Ahhhhh, 
Wow! And for the unheard-of 
price of $7.95(!) anyone can now 
own his own Freas collection. That 
has to be the best buy I have ever 
seen in my life, and if you have 
ever O-o-o-o-ed or Ahhh-ed or 
Wow-ed at a Freas and you miss 
your chance to get this, you are a 
fringe fan. 

The address is: The Donning 
Company, 253 West Bute St., Nor- 
folk, Virginia 23510. 

There are two other editions 
available: a hard-cover for $12.95,

slip-cased, gold-embossed, and 
wrapped in a real cow, for $29.95. 

I do not usually wax so commer- 
cial in my book reviews, but I have' 
perused this tall, slim volume at 
least a dozen times and each time 
found something new to delight in 
or to wonder at. A few may be put 
off by the fannish style of Freas’ 
commentary but I found it pleasant 
and informative, without arrogance 
or pretentiousness. The man seems 
to be almost as charming as his art. 
1 say “almost,” because nothing 
could be better than that. 

I do disagree with some of the 
things he says. While I obviously 
admire him as an artist, 1 have 
never understood him as an illus- 
trator. My idea of an illustrator’s 
job is best said by Freas himself: 
“The best illustration does much 
more than simply present an inci- 
dent from a story in visual form. It 
may indeed present such an inci- 
dent, but it also captures a mood, a 
spirit, an idea, which is a proper 
and vital part of the story but which 
is, for one reason or another, not 
expressible in words.” 

The key to my disagreement is in 
the word “proper.” Proper to 
whom? And who says so? I have 
rarely, if ever, thought Freas’ illus- 
trations were “proper” to anything 
but Freas’ art. For “proper” in the 
proper sense as it relates to illustrat- 
ing a work of fiction means render- 
ing the writer’s idea in accord with 
the writer’s imagination. That is, 
seeing the scene as the writer sees it 
himself. 

The trouble with Freas is that his 
talent and ability are so far greater 
than most of the writers he has 
illustrated — his vision so superior, 



so uniquely his own — that rather 
than complementing and illuminat- 
ing the stories, his illustrations con- 
tradict them and intrude on them. 
They seem sometimes a broad 
parody of them. It is only when 
they are seen out of context, for 
their own sake, that their merit can 
be appreciated. 

In fairness, Asimov and Clement 
are quoted in the book saying the 
opposite about the illos Freas did 
for their stories. 

My second disagreement is that 
Freas is not a science-fiction artist 
at all, but an artist of romantic fan- 
tasy. As, 1 must add, was his idol 
and mentor, John W. Campbell. 
Some of the best fantasy appeared 
in his hard science-fiction maga- 
zine. 

I can best illustrate the difference 
by saying that Chesley Bonestell 
was a science-fiction artist. In 
Bonestell, the fact of the landscape 
was the point of the work. In Freas, 
it is only a beginning. Freas, like 
Campbell, looked for the wonder 
in and beyond the facts. Facts in 
themselves were never sufficient 
for wonder, as they are to the truly 
hard scientific imagination. It was 
the possibilities inherent in the 
facts, the play of ideas for its own 
sake, that made the Campbell 
imagination so influential. 

And it is that same playfulness 
with facts that makes Freas so much 
fun. 

I should add here that Freas’ 
playfulness is one of the most im- 
portant elements of his greatness — a 
quality that most major science- 
fiction writers lack. Freas rarely 
takes his tongue out of his cheek, 
and more often than not his works 



BOOKSHELF

laugh out loud, not only at them- 
selves but at science fiction itself. 
By the use of humor Freas is able 
to overcome the mind’s natural re- 
sistance to accepting plausible im- 
possibilities and to bring to his most 
outlandish vision a sense of earthy re- 
ality. 

The earthiness is there in the 
faces: those staring, mocking, quiz- 
zical, pain-filled faces, worn by 
hard work and hard times, with 
thick wrinkles and sensual mouths; 
broad-shouldered men with thick 
biceps; or withered old men, sered 
by long experience. Not the faces 
one would ever imagine the men of 
the future wearing. Hardly in- 
tellectual faces. Hardly the 
physiques of sedentary men. More 
like farmers and truck drivers and 
factory workers. 

And the women. Hell, 1 hate to 
say it, but they’re not much good 
for anything but bedding. Big- 
bosomed mannikins. Characterless, 
eternally passive, masochistic. 

In his depiction of women, such 
as the one for “The Telzey Toy,” 
we find the only time he achieves 
vulgarity. 

As 1 said, Norman Rockwell is 
one of my favorite artists and 1 like 
him for many of the same reasons I 
like Freas. There is instant com- 
munication. Instant and effective. 1 
know precisely what both men are 
trying to say and I feel it and I care 
about it. But while Rockwell is bet- 
ter at his best than Freas is, he is 
not quite as honest. 

In Rockwell there is always one 
excessive, and excessively cute, de- 
tail that the picture would have been 
better without. Usually a dog or an 
especially cloying child, In Freas 



the excessive detail is usually a 
spaceship. Or two or three, flying 
in formation. But they are never 
cute. And while they limit the qual- 
ity of the picture, they do not ruin it 
in the way Rockwell’s excesses so 
often ruin his. 

Finally — oh, well, why go on? 
This will probably be the first rave 
review in literary history to infuriate 
the recipient of its praise. I can’t 
help that. I do not write for writers, 
but for readers. And, dear reader, if 
you never take another of my rec- 
ommendations, please take this 
one: Get a copy of FKF’s The Art 
of Science Fiction. You may never 
own a better science-fiction book. 

Zen BEMs 

Halfway through Gregory Ben- 
ford’s In the Ocean of Night I had a 
vivid recollection of an article I 
read years ago. It was a technical 
study of a group of men whose job 
it was to sit before radar, screens in 
darkened rooms day in and day out 
for weeks at a time. It was found 
that their senses became so be- 
numbed by the boredom that when 
a blip finally did appear, they did 
not respond to it. While reading this 
novel, 1 had at least two similar ex- 
periences, for when something dra- 
matic finally did occur, I was so 
benumbed by all the words that had 
gone before that it took me two 
pages to realize that I had missed 
something. 

In the Ocean of Night is that 

most dreadful of literary phe- 
nomena: the well-written novel. 

That is, a book whose well- 

written-ness overwhelms everything 
else within it; whose prose has so 
much more distinction than anything 



150 



GALAXY 




else in it that one is led to think the 
prose itself is what the book is 
about. 

Benford must have put a lot of 
time and effort into it. The pro- 
tagonists’ neuroses are laboriously 
detailed. The backgrounds of earth, 
the moon, and the interior of the 
alien ships are elaborate and atmos- 
pheric. In fact, the scientific and 
sociological details are the best 
things in the book, consistently in- 
telligent and frequently wondrous. 
But the brooding atmosphere that 
pervades everything, while occasion- 
ally effective, is ultimately tedious. 

And then there are the words, 
words, words. 

In 1999 the asteroid Icarus sud- 
denly begins to act like a comet. Its 
orbit is altered. It imperils the earth. 
Two men are sent out to destroy it. 
The hero, Nigel Walmsley, an Eng- 
lish astronaut working for NASA, 
discovers that the asteroid/comet is 
really a spaceship left by ancient 
alien explorers. He resists com- 
mands to blow it up, attempting in- 
stead to salvage whatever technol- 
ogy it offers in the hope that it will 
solve the terrible mess man has 
made of the world. 

End of Part I. 

At this point Benford had my 
interest. What would happen next? 
Could Nigel preserve the secrets of 
the aliens and still save the earth in 
time? 

Unfortunately, Benford was unin- 
terested in the question. 

Part II begins years later. Every- 
thing is over, and we are given the 
details in a few paragraphs. Nigel is 
now involved in a triangular love 
affair with two women, one of 
whom is dying of pollution disease. 



Besides this, he is working at the 
JPL Labs in California, trying to 
solve the mystery of a strange ex- 
traterrestrial manifestation that 
seems to be moving in our direc- 
tion. And besides this, the mani- 
festation itself is an alien craft in 
search of life. 

What had started out to seem a 
combination of Lucifer’s Hammer 
and Rendevous with Rama now 
seemed to become a combination of 
The Mote in God’s Eye and Love 
Story. But . .no. After an inter- 
minably leisurely buildup of the 
three plot lines toward another 
climax, Part III begins, and Benford 
is off in yet another direction. This 
time he’s on the moon. 

Nigel has a new girlfriend. She 
discovers another alien ship on the 
moon. She and Nigel are soon hard 
at work trying to decipher its mys- 
teries, one of which may save hu- 
manity from extermination by hos- 
tile alien gadgets. Meanwhile, on 
earth, a Japanese scientist living in 
a cabin in the wilderness finds a 
man half-dead in the snow. The 
man, who claims to have just es- 
caped from a tribe of Bigfootians, is 
carrying a remarkable weapon 
which the Japanese realizes is of 
alien manufacture. 

Once again the various plot lines 
work tortuously toward still another 
climax, which turns out to be just 
as ambiguous as the other two. 

In the end, however, all is resolv- 
ed. And it turns out that what Ben- 
ford wants the novel to be about is 
the resolution of Nigel’s spiritual 
alienation, which is accomplished, as 
it usually is these days, with the 
hero freakier than he ever was be- 
fore. 



BOOKSHELF 



151 




I hesitate to call the novel “tur- 
gid,” although it is, for it is not so 
much over- written, although it is, as 
overconceived. There is just too 
much in it, and most of it is so ir- 
relevant to what is most interesting 
in it that the real drama is buried 
alive. 

Of course this is a patchwork 
novel, comprised of three stories 
from IF, F&SF, and a Silverberg 
anthology — which explains much 
but excuses nothing. A novel is 
about what is most interesting about 
it; and in Benford’s case, his aliens 
are more interesting than anything 
else. The characters, while they are 
carefully drawn and frequently 
come to life, are no match for the 
events in which they are involved. 
But Benford refuses to accept this. 
He keeps taking us away from the 
aliens in order to show us the phys- 
ical and spiritual plight of the world 
of which, I assume, his hero is the 
epitome. The people are occasion- 
ally interesting but no match for the 
mythic wonder of the aliens. 

What is worse is that in patching 
the novel together, Benford should 
have realized he had three large 
climaxes to deal with and no way to 
escape them gracefully. The effect 
of a stunted climax is a kind of 
literary constipation that leaves the 
reader first bewildered and then 
bored. 

And Benford compounds the 
problem with refusing to develop 
even small climaxes. On page 242, 
the end of Chapter Three finds 
Nigel and his girlfriend in posses- 
sion of a very exciting piece of evi- 
dence as to the possible appearance 
of the aliens. As Chapter Four 
opens, the reader is chomping the 



bit to know more. But what he gets 
is; “Mr. Inchino stood at the 
small sink and slowly washed the 
dishes after supper.” 

And that is the end of the alien 
artifact except as it is mentioned 
later in conversation. And don’t 
think that Benford is being cagey in 
switching our attention at the mo- 
ment of suspense, for moments are 
all there are; and the book is filled 
with long paragraphs of menial ac- 
tion such as we see Mr. Inchino 
perform. You know — “He walked 
to the door. He opened the door. 
He entered the room. He closed the 
door. ’ ’ 

All of these faults add up to a 
very boring book. Yet I would not 
be at all surprised to find it nomi- 
nated for a Nebula. After all, it is 
so well- written. 

A Silverberger with Hoskins Sauce 

Someday I am going to write a 
book about the great unsung heroes 
of science fiction: the anthologists. 
Don’t laugh. Oh, I know most 
knowledgeable people regard the an- 
thology as a fast, easy way for an 
enterprising writer to make a buck 
and nothing more. But without them 
my own reading would have been a 
lot poorer. A good anthologist is 
like a good friend whose opinion 
you trust. It is a sharing of en- 
thusiasms. You may not agree with 
all of the editor’s choices — you may 
even violently disagree with half of 
them — but if the ones you like 
make as great an impression on you 
as they did on him, you learn to 
trust him. 

Two anthologists I have come to 
trust are Robert Silverberg and 
Robert Hoskins.

GALAXY 




Despite the portentous subtitle, 
“Science Fiction as Visionary Lit- 
erature,” Galactic Dreamers is a 
grand bag of eight stories, only one 
of which 1 violently disagree with. 
It begins with James Blish’s ex- 
traordinary “Common Time” and 
includes J.G. Ballard’s intriguing 
“The Waiting Grounds” and 
Cordwainer Smith’s brilliant “The 
Dead Lady of Clown Town.” 

Others included are a typically 
ingenious Jack Vance collage 
called “The New Prime” and 
John W. Campbell’s devastating 
“Night”; an R.A. Lafferty (“Sky”) 
that, frankly, went over my head 
but left me grinning with pleasure 
nevertheless; a curiously old- 
fashioned (for him) story by Brian 
Aldiss called “Incentive”; and Sil- 
verberg’s own “Breckenridge and 
the Continuum,” about which my 
mother has told me to say nothing 
at all. 

Silverberg states his theme best: 
“As a reader, I am most excited 
by the kind of science fiction 
that offers consciousness-expanding 
views of wondrous reaches of space 
and time — fiction that creates myths 
about the future. ” 

Hoskins likewise has a drum to 
beat. His anthology purports to 
show science-fiction stories con- 
cerned with “saving the future.” 

As a friend of mine used to say: 
She-e-et. 

I strongly suspect that the reason 
why nine out of ten anthologies 
have such introductions is a deep 
feeling of guilt within the editors — 
as within almost everyone con- 
nected with science fiction after a 
certain age — over the fact that they 
are involved in an adolescent activ- 



ity. I wish I could say I felt other- 
wise. Sometimes I do. But science 
fiction, like any other genre, 
perhaps like any other activity, has 
its limits. The passion for it, usually 
born in adolescence, does not last 
forever. I still like science fiction 
but I no longer love it, as is the 
case with more than one science- 
fiction writer. Their problem 
is: They can’t admit it. 

But the truth of it is, you don’t 
have to love a thing to do it well. 
And sometimes not loving it helps 
you to do the thing better. 

Robert Hoskins is the former 
editor of Lancer Books, and a terror 
he was. But those, like me, who 
liked him at all, liked him very 
much. So it came as no surprise to 
me after he left Lancer to find him 
editing .a series of first-rate an- 
thologies. The Future Now is the 
latest of them, and for $1.75 it is a 
good buy. 

There are Fred Pohl’s marvelous 
“The Merchants of Venus” and 
Dean R. Koontz’s effective “A 
Season for Freedom” and Barry N. 
Malzberg’s (in my opinion) best 
story, “Final War”; and Poul An- 
derson’s “Home,” Harlan Ellison’s 
“Silent in Gehenna,” Silverberg’s 
“The Wind and the Rain,” Bill 
Pronzini’s “Our Times,” Isaac 
Asimov’s “All the Troubles in the 
World” and Hoskins’ own “The 
Mountain,” plus a curiousity by 
Ursula K. Le Guin called “The Sta- 
lin in the Soul,” Ed Bryant’s 
“Shark” and Virginia Kidd’s 
“Flowering Season.” 

I can tell you this: The name of 
Silverberg or Hoskins on an anthol- 
ogy guarantees that you’ll get your 
money’s worth. ★

DIRECTIONS 



Dear J.J., 

Since I’ve written my Galaxy article 
on Star Wars, I’ve seen numerous re- 
views in just about every imaginable 
place. Some are genuinely instructive 
and thoughtful, while others run from 
the sublime (“Did you know that ‘Star 
War’ backwards is ‘Raw Rats?’) to the 
incorrect. Among the latter are several 
assertions that Chewbacca is straight out 
of Planet of the Apes. In view of the 
widespread interest in Chewbacca and 
the other characters, I’d like to add 
something to my article. Now, George 
Lucas was indeed having fun evoking a 
wide range of old science fiction and 
fantasy films, but the key to the nature 
of the second mate of the Millenium 
Falcon lies in a parallel with The Wizard 
of Oz, not the Planet of the Apes. Phys- 
ically, he is furry — but in everything 
else, including his facial features and 
inarticulate snarlings, he is very un- 
Planet-of-the- Apes-like. 

The leading characters are on a sort 
of Yellow Brick Road trek. C-3PO is a 
tin man who lacks a heart at the begin- 
ning, always thinking only of himself, 
but who ends up with a compassionate 
nature and such feelings for his fellow 
robot that he volunteers gears and cir- 
cuits to save his friend. Hans Solo 
comes from a jungle of vicious crea- 



tures where he may be a type of king 
due to his innate attributes, but is a 
cowardly figure none the less. In the 
course of reaching the journey’s end, he 
displays unexpected courage, including 
the rout of Imperial Stormtroopers by 
stampeding them with a show of feroc- 
ity, and ending with his joining battle to 
save his friends. 

Found in a symbolic cornfield, Luke 
Skywalker is unable to think for himself 
or formulate plans for the future, but 
like the Scarecrow soon starts display- 
ing originality of mind, working out a 
plan to rescue the Princess and finally 
how best to destroy Death Star. Chewie 
is Toto, an inarticulate hairy beast that 
displays great devotion and does as he 
is told by his master. Also, I’m sure 
everyone has noticed, he is a great hit 
with the movie audience — because like 
a cute dog, he is so lovable. Hans Solo 
alternately pets or kicks him. 

The Princess may be a girl, but is a 
tough customer like Dorothy who, you 
will recall, killed two wicked witches. 
Dropped a house on one and melted the 
other. (Darth Vader better watch out, 
come Star Wars //!) Obi-Wan Kenobi 
is the embodiment of Glinda the Good’s 
magical guidance along the Yellow 
Brick Road. R2-D2 has no parallel, as 
far as I can see, unless it’s a tenuous 
one with the Mouse Queen. However, 
there is no mistaking the final scene in 
the great Palace where awards are 
handed out — and the metal man is re- 
splendant in fresh plating and burnish- 
ing. 

Having seen Star Wars again since 
writing my article, I remain convinced 
that the movie is more complex than 
generally realized, since there are sev- 
eral levels of understanding required to 
achieve a full comprehension of what 
George Lucas was doing. And to an-

swer in brief what seems to be the 
major point of the relatively few ad- 
verse reviews, if indeed Star Wars is 
childish on one level, it is not that way 
on others nor is it unidimensional in the 
least.

Of course, some critics have already 
seen allusions to The Triumph of the 
Will in the closing scene of Star Wars. 
But even they don't notice the sort of 
things you mention. Meanwhile, back in 
Hollywood, it's rip-off time: Starship 
Invasions, Star Crash, Star Maidens. 
Blecch!

Mr. Baen; 

Some comments, if I may, on your 
September issue. 

To put last things first, J. Flower’s 
“Coming Home” seems to me to be 
very close to libel. 1 pride myself on 
being one of those who became a 
Democrat in the early 50’s primarily 
because the then Vice President was a 
Republican. And I know the bounds of 
paranoia are difficult to set, BUT 1 have 
never been given any reason to believe 
that the man would ever do physical in- 
jury to his nation — even to regain con- 
trol of it. 

But that story was fairly typical of 
the “down-beat” feeling of the entire 
issue. Jerry Pournelle, in his article, 
told us a sweet fairy tale about how won- 
derful life could be if we will just turn 
all the decision-making processes over 
to the technologists. The rest of the is- 
sue, except for J.E.P.’s serial, told us 
what horrors confront us if we fail to 



follow his advice. The serial, on the 
other hand, tells us that the solution to 
our energy problem and conquest of the 
solar system will still leave us with an 
overpopulated world and massive un- 
employment unless we also find the 
new social and political institutions 
which will enable us to utilize this 
technological bounty. And this is the 
most depressing element in the issue; 
the man who professes to have the an- 
swers really offers us nothing but the 
same old balderdash warmed over on a 
nuclear fire and served up in a deep- 
space squeeze bulb. 

Mr. Pournelle is an excellent writer 
and Dr. Pournelle is no doubt quite 
learned in the physical sciences. I am 
quite willing to concede the possibility 
of solar fusion power sources saving our 
necks in the long run, although I must 
say that I have yet to see any convinc- 
ing evidence that controlled fusion is 
closer today than it was ten years ago. I 
am willing to accept the short-run solu- 
tion of fission power — provided that 
someone will show me a system of 
waste disposal which has progressed 
beyond the “working paper” stage and 
is acceptable to the people who live 
next door to the dump. I am willing to 
accept coal (with scrubbers), methane, 
and alcohol as viable alternatives to pet- 
roleum and to accept their higher costs. 

I will even accept the environmental 
damage and the human damage inherent 
in current coal-mining technology — 
although I hope someone will find ways 
to minimize those costs. But I will not 
accept the destruction of democratic in- 
stitutions, the imposition of eighteenth- 
century conceptions of justice, and 
the permanent “welfarization” of 
a major portion of our population by 
increasingly capital-intensive means of 
production without provision for worth-

while employment of those who are not 
equipped to function in a capital- 
intensive economy. Dr. Pournelle must 
also deal with this human economic 
problem — the man or woman who is not 
fit to go into space, either cannot learn 
or has had no opportunity to learn the 
skills which are saleable in a high- 
technology society, or simply cannot 
compete in the highly individualistic so- 
ciety which he and Dr. Anderson hold 
up to us as the ideal. Unless you are 
prepared to institute some kind of 
eugenic — social extermination program, 
your society must provide for the weak 
as well as the strong, and the rights of 
all citizens must continue to be 
safeguarded. Like the attorney who is 
pictured as a silly — if not insane — 
weakling in Pournelle’s story, 1 do not 
believe that the captain of a ship has the 
right to take risks with the lives of his 
passengers without giving them some 
voice in the matter and I do not believe 
that he has a right to sentence a man to 
a period of penal servitude without due 
process of law. In this story, the captain 
is a Solomon, and obviously the attempt 
to catch Ceres is not going to result in 
the death of our heroes (male and 
female) but all captains are not Sol- 
omons and all desperate risks do not 
succeed and the end does not justify the 
means. 

1 wish Dr. Pournelle and all of the 
other able scientists who are writing 
science fiction today would give some 
attention to problems which are other 
than technological. I have no doubt that 
technology can be found to replace our 
petroleum economy. 1 am not at all sure 
that we will find the new social, 
economic, and political institutions that 
are the minimum requirement for human 
survival in a world of exploding popula- 
tions, rising expectations, and continu- 



ing displacement of human labor by 
machines. 

This is overlong and not entirely co- 
herent, 1 am sure. 1 haven’t time to re- 
write now and do not wish to delay 
sending it off. So here it is with bad 
typing, perhaps misspellings, and other 
flaws — of art and of logic, perhaps. 

Spider Robinson was excellent, as 
usual. I especially liked his comments 
on Joanna Russ’ “chip on the shoul- 
der” attitude. I hate to see such a fine 
writer ruined by obsession with a “mes- 
sage.” And I hate to see the movement 
for human liberation cluttered up with 
bitter sexist attacks from either side. 

I liked Fabian’s work, as always.

First: my story Exiles to Glory assumes 
that there will NOT be continued investment 
in space and high technology ; ir examines 
what I think would be the consequences of the 
Carter energy program ( which has no in- 
vestments in new technology: and siphons off 
$40 billion or so annually for use in more 
welfare programs: the Carter “energy war ” 
begins by disbanding the armored divisions 
of fusion research, and ends with huge taxes 
to be used to equalize income). 

In my judgment there are profits to be made 
in space, and there may well be attempts to 
exploit space despite government opposition 
to technology: that means a transfer of con- 
trol from democratic institutions (if there are 
any in this world) to board rooms; flight of 
capital from the US to tax havens; and such. 
My story also assumes unlikely investment 
levels by private fortunes — else things would 
never have got even as far as they have in 
the world of Exiles. 

Second: regarding nuclear wastes: if the 
entire WORLD were to operate exclusively 
on nuclear power, the accumulated wastes 



156 



GALAXY 




would, after 50,000 years, cover one square 
mile to a depth of about ten feet. We have 
many square miles of Mojave Desert not far 
from where I live. If there is no better way 
to handle wastes, solidify them, place them 
in the Mojave, build a “superdome” con- 
crete structure above them, surround with 
chain link fence, and put up a sign that says 
“IF YOU GO OVER THIS FENCE, YOU 
WILL DIE 

Third: whether or not I approve of the ac- 
tions of Captain Greiner in my story is ir- 
relevant: the story says that such actions can 
happen. Frontier societies usually have in- 
stitutions different from settled societies. One 
need not approve — or disapprove — of Fron- 
tier or Ship-board justice to write about what 
may be inevitable. 

Fourth: I know of no rational proposal to 
send any great part of the population to 
space. I think it demonstrable that given 
space research and new energy sources there 
will be a very much larger pie to split here 
on Earth: and I think it fairly obvious that 
the wealthier the society, the more real free- 
doms its citizens enjoy. It is an economy of 
scarcity that creates rigid class lines, feudal 
institutions, and the like. Without abundant 
cheap energy, an economy of scarcity is in- 
evitable: and that means regulations, 

bureaucracy, government, and lawyers, 
lawyers, lawyers. 

Finally: / have never proposed turning 
over "all the decision-making processes " to 
the technologists. Indeed, on all referenda I 
know of, the voting public has overwhelm- 
ingly approved nuclear power and high 
technology options: it is " experts " such as 
Freeman of the Ford Foundation Energy 
Project (now a White House energy expert 
on public payroll) who terrify me, not the 
citizen body. The "experts" have produced a 
plan which guarantees scarcities; I think they 
are afraid of wealth, which creates real 
freedoms — such as the freedom of a street 
sweeper to hike in THEIR High Sierra. 

— Jerry Pournelle 



Dear Mr. Baen: 

Confusion appears to exist over the 
distinction between “religious beliefs” 
and religious impulses.” This seems to 
be because these terms, as we are using 
them, are not clearly defined. 

“Religious impulses” and “religious 
beliefs” are not seperate entities. They 
are simply different parts of a single 
concept — “religious impulses” the first, 
and “religious beliefs” the second. 

“Religious impulses,” like territorial- 
ity and the sex-drive, came into being, 
as you say, “earlier in the sceme of 
things” — ergo, before man used tools, 
could speak, or had any conception of 
right and wrong. They were formed 
back during those dim times in the past 
before conscious human thought-process 
evolved. Therefore, obviously, they 
were “founded in ignorance”. 

But when people recognize “religious 
impulses,” that is, admit they are moti- 
vated by them, they then become “re- 
ligious beliefs.” 

The basic “religious impulse” — 
“religious belief” is to believe in 
“God.” 

“God” created heaven and Earth — 
the entire universe, all that exist. He 
therefore oversees and controls every- 
thing, including the people of this 
world. 

Why do people believe this? 

Because they are brought up in a cul- 
ture that already believes it, and so edu- 
cates them in it, conditions them to ac- 
cept it. 

This is why you believe in “God.” 

You would believe in Brahman, Al- 
lah, or follow the teachings of Gautama 
just as devotedly and incessantly, had 
you been brought up in India, the 
Middle-East, or China. 

But what evidence have you that 
“God” exist? 



DIRECTIONS 



157 




None. 

You can only say that, during your 
entire life, you have heard other people 
talk of “God,” or read what other 
people have written about “God.” 
Everyone, in fact, that professes 
“God” as real, can only offer this, and 
no more, in their defense of “God’s” 
existence — what they have heard others 
say or what they have read that others 
have written, as, indeed, these latter 
people can only attribute their own be- 

When is a chest pain a 
heart attack? 

Often, determining the cause of a 
chest pain is difficult. So how can a 
doctor tell when it's a heart attack? 

The American Heart Association is 
supporting research to help doctors 
identify heart attacks as early as possi- 
ble. 

One research method is the mych 
cardial scinti g ram. It allows accurate 
diagnosis of heart damage without 
catheters, without the injection of 
dyes. 

With it, doctors can actually look 
inside a patient's oody to evaluate the 
heart's condition. If there is heart 
damage, the doctors can see exactly 
where — and how extensive — it is. 

The myocardial scintigram was 
pioneered through research sup- 
ported by the American Heart Asso- 
ciation.

liefs in “God” to even older sayings 
and writings of yet others. — And so 
the process continues back through 
time. 

This is not evidence; it is hearsay. 

Now then. Science is based on 
knowledge obtained from observation of 
revelant phonemona. That is, scientists 
accept as true only what can be proved 
by material evidance. 

In this way, science-fictionist are also 
supposed to conduct themselves — as 
implied by their commitments to follow 
the principles of science. 

I find it very hypocritical for you, a 
science-fiction reader, writer, and editor 
as well, to blatantly and contemptiously 
come out and sat that the existance of 
“God” is automatically a fact and not 
just a belief. 

I see no reason why it isn’t a reason- 
able interpertaion of: 

“. anyone who believes in the 
Old Testament . must consider him- 
self as divinely instructed to ... do all 
in his power to further the development 
of our space capabilities, • and ... he 
must resist and defy any person, process 
or philosphy that acts as a determinent 
to that goal.” 

to say: 

“You instruct us to instigate subver- 
sion, insurrection, and revolution, 
commit criminal acts, engage in 
treason, or do anything necessary, if it 
serves to further the progress of hu- 
mankind into space’.”

And here I thought the South was all 
Bible Belt ! Well, / don't think Jim needs 
any defense against the likes of you — or 
the likes of the religious fanatics you 
imagine you oppose.

VOLUNTEERS FOR THE BLIND 



One of the Jim Baen’s last acts as editor of GALAXY was to ask for 
volunteers to do readings, make recordings and even perform other services 
to make the magazine available to the blind. 

The response was overwhelming — almost a tidal wave. After nearly 
drowning in it, your new editor faced the problem: what to do now? Jim 
hadn’t had time to set up a clearinghouse for such volunteers, nor had any 
sf club offered to take on the job. 

The most feasible solution right now, and the one therefore being fol- 
lowed, is to set up a file of volunteers, by area and by services offered, to 
be made available to blind sf fans. We will try to match volunteers with 
blind fans in particular areas as best we can. 

By the time this issue appears, we should have a file large enough to 
provide volunteers in most populous areas, at least — and will be able to 
supply names and addresses to blind fans on request. Time does not permit 
us to get involved further — as by making GALAXY a distribution center for 
recordings, etc. We hope some of you, besides requesting help for blind 
fans or volunteering your own services, may have some better ideas for 
administering the Volunteers for the Blind program.
