SO FAR 



OR those who somehow man- 
aged to miss the past couple of 
issues, here is a brief recap: 

In going to a big, roomy 196 
pages, we have, as we did back 
in 1950, turned over to our read- 
ers every single policy concerning 
everything that fits between the 
covers, and the covers themselves 
— with the assurance, same as just 
short of a decade ago, that every 
vote would be counted and that 
only they would set our policies. 

Why? Well, there’s a monstrous 
lot of mystic nonsense written and 
orated about democracy, but near- 
ly all of it misses the real point: 
people in general generally know 
what’s good for them. Like a few 
politicians, a few editors can be 
spooky in their divining of reader 
wishes. But why guess when it’s 
only necessary to ask? 

So we did, in 1950, and by lis- 
tening hard and obeying honestly, 
Galaxy in perhaps the shortest 
time on record took command of 
its field — and then crossed oceans 
into the British Empire, France 
(including Belgium and Switzer- 
land), Germany, Italy, Sweden, 
Finland, with other countries now 
negotiating for editions in their 
own languages — to become, be- 
yond challenge, the most widely 
read science fiction magazine on 
Earth. 



What’s mystical about results 
like those? By doing just what we 
did, but calling it survey in depth, 
smart manufacturers put the same 
phenomenon to work: their cus- 
tomers know what they want. If 
that’s so with impersonal goods, 
think how much truer it is with 
anything so personal as one’s fav- 
orite kind of reading. 

Nine years is long enough for 
tastes to change, new readers to 
come in, policies to need overhaul- 
ing. Expanding to a giant new size 
is the best possible opportunity for 
updating our poll. 

The response resembles a board 
meeting of thousands all talking 
excitedly and at once. Spotting the 
trends is not easy; the figures 
bounce and jiggle because letters 
are still — no, by blue, this is no 
time for modesty — letters are still 
pouring in, fully as many and as 
passionately helpful as the 1950 
flood — and practically every let- 
ter has one or more subscriptions 
enclosed! 

Remarkably few readers join 
Norman Schwarz of Camden, 
N. J., in wondering “just what ef- 
fect a letter to the editor has on 
actual policies. I hope for the best 
and fear the worst.” Most feel as 
does Mrs. Weston Baker of Clay- 
ton, N. M.: “I appreciate the 

chance to tell you how to run a 



6 



GALAXY 



magazine,” which may sound 
cheeky to non-believers, but is ex- 
actly what we are asking. 

Whether a Mr. Schwarz or a 
Mrs. Baker, however, not much 
less than 100% are warm in their 
friendship, keenly intelligent in 
their preferences and dislikes, so 
realistic about publishing that one 
would think they had been in it 
all their lives — until it’s realized 
they know that the facts of life, 
economic and otherwise, apply as 
inexorably to a magazine as a 
home, a lab or a business. 

There are crabs among us, of 
course, but statistically insignifi- 
cant. This discovery is a shock 
every time it happens. More about 
it later on. 

lVTOW let’s start plotting interim 

' curves as well as incomplete 
returns will allow. 

• To begin with, the heart of the 
magazine — stories. As we said, all 
sorts of combinations are possible 
with 196 pages to move around 
in. Many magazines strive for very 
long contents pages by using very 
short stories — often no more than 
one-page anecdotes — and a med- 
ium-length novelet or two. This 
policy, we added, makes sense only 
if readers prefer clumps of dwarf 
items to fewer but very much 
sturdier stories. Well, we asked, do 
you? Or would you rather have 
the short stories held down, even 
if they make the contents page 



look synthetically hefty, and more 
novelets and novellas? Or do you 
have other ideas on content and 
balance? 

Even at this midpoint, with so 
many counties still unheard from, 
the trend appears clear: contents- 
padding fillers are not wanted; 
full-scale treatments are. 

Some amplification is needed 
here. A number of readers felt we 
ought to be told to buy material 
on the basis of quality instead of 
length. We do, of course, as near- 
ly always as human fallibility 
will allow. But quality and length 
are often the same thing: a good 
story idea appropriately devel- 
oped, free both of padding and ex- 
cessive compression. 

For story ideas are more com- 
pressible and expandable than you 
might imagine, and arbitrary 
length limitations are often im- 
posed on stories — how long they 
must be, rather than how long they 
should be. By not bloating our 
contents page, we can give stories 
their head. True enough, writers 
tend to inflate more than com- 
press, but a good many memorable 
items have been made so by our 
asking for fuller treatment — and 
one of our most famous serials was 
formed of two intended short 
stories which, combined, swiftly 
reached critical mass! 

So the question of length vs. 
quality is really settled only by

The City

off 




T HE City of Force was a 
huge expanse of radiant 
beauty that dominated the 
plain like a thousand curtains of 
vivid flame. Staring at it, Bruno 
pulled his robe more tightly about 
him and clutched his staff. The 
bold suggestion of dawn reflected 
lividly against his thin face. But 
it was the glare of the City’s great 
sheets of energy — its ribbons and 
spires of force, its magnificent 
auras and beams and sparkling 
discharges — that cast his shadow 
back into the forest from which 
he had come. 

Resolutely, he shifted his pack 
to a more comfortable position 
and continued toward the holo- 
caust of light. 

"Where do you think you’re 
going, son?” 

The voice, magnified by its un-

THE CITY OF FORCE

expectedness, had come like a 
clap of thunder from the trees 
behind him. 

“Nothing to be afraid of, boy.” 
There was a dry laugh. “I’m just 
a harmless old codger.” 

Bruno turned and watched the 
man approach. He had a small, 
wry face and a fringe of hair that 
encircled his almost bald head like 
a wreath. The full folds of his 
robe only gave emphasis to his 
pot-belly and failed to hide a pair 
of dusty, sandaled feet. 

“What are you doing here?” 
Bruno demanded. 

“Getting away from the bright 
lights.” 

“You live in the City?” 

“Always did. It’s a pretty easy 
life, but kind of tiring once in a 
while. Name’s Everard.” The old 
man drew up before him and stood 
staring into his face. “New around 
here, eh?” 

“I’m Bruno, from one of the 
forest clans.” 

Everard laughed, his hands out- 
stretched over his paunch as 
though to hold it steady. “Come 
for some lush City life?” 

“I’ve come to contact the 
Spheres,” Bruno said stiffly. 

The aged face displayed a se- 
quence of expressions that ended 
in a broad, almost toothless grin 
and another burst of laughter. 
“Contact the Spheres? Boy, you 
got a lot to learn!” 

“I know nobody’s ever been 



able to get through to them. But 
it’s got to be done someday.” 

“So you’re taking it upon your- 
self to learn their lingo, eh?” There 
was a kindly cynicism in the old 
man’s voice now. “Us fellows who 
live in the Cities with ’em — al- 
most under their feet — can’t even 
do it. And you’re going to step in, 
fresh from the haystack, and show 
us how!” 

D RUNO turned indignantly and 
strode off toward the shim- 
mering masses of pure force. 

Everard shuffled to keep up 
with him. “Determined, eh? That’s 
the spirit, son,” he taunted. 

“Beat it, Pops.” Bruno put a 
hand against the other’s chest and 
shoved him off. “I know what I’m 
doing.” 

The ol dmat stood scratching 
his head. “You are serious. Ever 
been in one of the Cities?” 

Bruno shook his head. 

' They got all kinds of force 
fields and energy areas. Some of 
’em are deadly. If you just touch 
the wrong glob of light or the 
wrong wall of ray stuff, you’re a 
goner.” 

“You live there, don’t you?” 
Bruno asked challengingly. 

“Yup. But — don’t you see? — 

I had a ma and pa to show me 
the ropes right from infancy.” 

Bruno propped his hands on his 
hips and stared once more at the 
City of Force. His eyes swept 



10 



GALAXY 



I 



over to another corner of the plain 
and, in the rising sun, sought out 
the once-great city of men. Over- 
grown with trees and smothering 
in its own dust, it was hardly more 
than a centuries-old rubbish heap 
now. 

The words the old man had 
spoken in derisive jest were wise 
ones, Bruno conceded. He was a 
fool to think he could contact the 
Spheres. Even the great intellects 
who ran the world of men hun- 
dreds of years ago had failed to 
communicate with the aliens. 
Otherwise they might have saved 
their own cities. 

“I’m going ahead anyway,” he 
said. 

“I can’t stop you?” 

“Try it.” 

“Then I’ll go along. Least I can 
do is see you don’t get yourself 
killed right off.” 

They headed for the City. 
“Know anybody by the name 
of Hulen?” Bruno asked. 

“Used to belong to the Spruce 
clan? Tall, dark fellow who came 
here about five years ago?” 
“That’s him. He’s my cousin.” 

“I know him.” 

“Can you take me to him?” 
“Glad to. Leastwise, he’s some- 
one I can turn you over to so’s 
I won’t have the responsibility.” 

A N hour later, with the sun 
beating down against their 
faces, Everard drew up and tossed 



his staff indifferently on the 
ground. “We wait here,” he an- 
nounced. 

Bruno glanced at the coruscat- 
ing curtains and auras and shields 
of the immaterial City, still miles 
away. 

“What for?” 

“There’s an easier way than 
walking there.” 

“I suppose one of the Spheres 
is going to come out and carry 
us piggyback,” Bruno said face- 
tiously. 

His eyes, however, remained on 
the City as he tried to pick out at 
least one material object in the 
concentration of visible forces — 
the fountains and hills of radiant 
energy, the sparkling geometrical 
nimbuses, the sheets of lazy light 
that floated from tenuous spire to 
tenuous spire. But there was none. 
And yet it didn’t seem odd that 
there should be nothing solid in 
the City. For the inhabitants, the 
shining Spheres, were said to be 
but creatures of pure force them- 
selves. 

And even as he stared at the 
wondrous edifice the aliens had 
built, a filament of pale green ener- 
gy arched swiftly outward from 
one of the lesser structures. Los- 
ing its perspective smallness as it 
approached, the end of the huge 
tubular projection speared back 
down to the ground only yards 
from where Bruno stood. 

He turned to flee. But the old 




THE CITY OF FORCE 



11 



man seemed unconcerned as he 
surveyed the transparent chute of 
restless, raw energy. 

Finally Everard backed off. 
“Get ready, son. We’re going to 
have to keep on our toes in a 
minute.” 

“Why?” Bruno demanded ap- 
prehensively. “What is it?” 

There was an almost inaudible 
whine as a swiftly moving form 
came streaking down the length of 
the force tube, drew to a halt and 
drifted out the end of the shaft. 

The enormous Sphere, towering 
higher than four men, hovered a 
few inches off the ground, its fea- 
tureless yellow surface seething 
like the disc of the setting sun. 
Bruno had the sickening feeling 
that, even though the alien pos- 
sessed no eyes, it was somehow 
looking at him. 

“Hop!” Everard shouted, seiz- 
ing his arm. 

And even as Bruno was jerked 
to one side, the play of forces 
over the surface of the Sphere 
coalesced into a fierce shaft of 
jagged light that streaked out to 
sear the ground where the two 
men had stood. 

“Keep on the go!” the old man 
instructed. “The stuff he throws 
is fast as hell. But his reactions 
ain’t. If you move quick enough, 
he’ll always hit where you just 
been.” 

Bruno took three steps forward 
and five to the left. And another 



bolt slammed down against the 
ground behind him. 

“But — I thought they couldn’t 
even notice us!” he stammered. 

Everard, a few feet away now, 
shuffled to his left, spun around 
and trotted off agilely in a new 
direction. He easily escaped the 
third blast. 

“Not notice us! Ha! That’s ridic- 
ulous. How do you suppose they 
destroyed all the cities? They see 
us, all right. But they think we’re 
just dumb life-forms — pests.” 

Bruno slowed his evasive tac- 
tics and almost took a searing bolt 
broadside. 

“Random movement!” Everard 
urged, panting. “And don’t repeat 
any moves or you’ll get it for sure. 
Still want to go on to the City?” 

“I’ll make out all right,” Bruno 
said doggedly. Then he noticed 
that the Sphere’s surface had lost 
its veneer of boiling energy. 

KAY, you can relax now,” 
Everard said. “It’s lost in- 
terest.” 

The old man darted into the 
shadow of the Sphere, ran around 
it once and, for a fraction of a 
second, stood there with his tongue 
out, thumbs in his ears and his 
fingers wiggling at the alien. He 
managed to coax one final burst 
of lightning from the creature be- 
fore it drifted disinterestedly away. 

“What next?” Bruno asked, col- 
lecting his pack and staff. 



12 



GALAXY 



“It’s happening now.” Everard 
indicated a brilliant speck of green 
light that was shimmering in mid- 
air about a hundred yards to the 
south. 

The point began expanding and 
Bruno watched it grow into a 
many-faceted geometrical figure. 
Through the transparent planes of 
its surface were visible ten or 
twelve bright yellow Spheres. The 
gemlike force structure expanded 
until its top towered scores of feet 
above the ground. The lone alien 
drifted over and joined the other 
Spheres as they floated out 
through the side. 

Bruno backed away misgiving- 

ly- 

“Nothing to be afraid of now, 
boy,” Everard assured him. 
“They’ll be too busy to notice us.” 
“Where did they come from?” 
“Another world, most likely. 
One that’s maybe not even in this 
universe.” 

“But how did they get here?” 
“You just saw it for yourself— 
from some kind of new direction. 
My grandpa said they’re probably 
coming from another world in this 
new direction and using Earth as 
a sort of way station.” 

“How did he know?” 

“Either figured it out himself or 
passed it down from somebody 
else up the line.” Everard took his 
wrist and began leading him to- 
ward the tunnel of green light 
that extended like a bridge into 



the City. “Come on. This is how 
we’re going the rest of the way.” 
“In there?” Bruno shied away 
from the seemingly solid shaft of 
radiant energy while he tried to 
keep the yellow Spheres in the 
periphery of his vision. 

“Beats walking,” the old man 
said. “You want me to take you 
to Hulen, don’t you?” 

Bruno gestured nervously at 
the aliens. “But they’re going in 
the tube too!” 

“Won’t notice us if we keep 
down at the bottom. Anyway, we’ll 
be ahead of ’em. Use the green 
chutes all the time myself— when- 
ever I can find one.” Everard 
stepped in through the glowing end 
of the tube and pulled Bruno 
along. “Just relax now, son, and 
think of wanting to go on into 
the City and see your cousin.” 
The tenuous shaft of force 
closed in pleasantly around Bruno 
like a blanket of warm, green sun- 
shine. Then suddenly the entire 
beam of energy seemed vibrantly 
alive, as though a thousand hands 
were materializing out of the mist- 
like substance to push him in the 
direction of the City. It was like 
sliding down an endless tunnel 
and eventually he relaxed and let 
the forces move him along. The 
plain below slipped by at an unbe- 
lievable speed. 

Somewhere along the way, he 
started tumbling buoyantly in his 
passage through the green nimbus. 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



13 



During his less forceful gyrations, 
he glanced over at Everard. The 
other seemed to be thoroughly en- 
joying the jostling he was receiv- 
ing from the docile power. 

They swept past the outer force 
structures of the City - past dense 
walls of lambent light and fiercely 
glowing pseudo-architectural forms 
that Bruno imagined might have 
vaguely resembled some of the 
buildings of the long-dead human 
cities. 

The chute curved past a great 
cataract of pure red energy that 
seemed to be spilling out of no- 
where and then it arched down to 
what appeared to be the ground 
level - a gently glowing carpet of 
pale pink stardust. An occasional 
Sphere drifted along below, either 
emerging from or disappearing 
into a wall of shimmering azure 
nothingness. 

II 

HTHE rambling shaft of motile 

energy curved right between 
two massive monoliths of pure 
white effulgence and weaved 
above a progression of huge, daz- 
zling blue mounds of force stuff. 

“We get off up ahead.” Everard 
spread both arms to arrest his 
tumbling motion. “Start thinking 
about slowing down.” 

Like pellets in a blowgun, the 
Spheres from the plain were rapid- 
ly overtaking them. The foremost 



discharged a lance of crackling 
light that set up a quivering vibra- 
tion all along the chute but fell 
short of its mark. 

“They’ve seen us!” Bruno 
warned, pulling to a halt beside 
the old man. 

“That’s all right.” 

“But they’ll have the whole City 
out looking for us!” 

Everard laughed scornfully. 
“You must think we’re somebody. 
Back in your village, would you 
call out the whole clan to help 
you look for a couple of cock- 
roaches you saw scurrying down 
the street?” 

“You mean we don’t even mat- 
ter?” 

“Oh, we’re a nuisance, all right,” 
the old man said almost boastful- 
ly. “They set traps now and then. 
And every once in a while they 
have an extermination. But we 
ain’t so dumb. We know what to 
do. They end up wiping out only 
a few of us at most.” 

Another bolt discharged along 
the chute, reaching closer to the 
pair before it played itself out in 
a splattering of weak sparks that 
were quickly swallowed up in the 
green nimbus of the tube. 

“This way,” Everard said, div- 
ing out through the side of the 
shaft. 

His easily relaxed body fell per- 
haps a hundred feet before crash- 
ing into the sloping wall of one 
of the dazzling blue mounds. He 



14 






bounced twice, almost disappear- 
ing into the feathery energy for- 
mation each time, before sliding 
fifty feet down to the surface. 

Gingerly, Bruno extended an 
arm through the side of the chute. 
Another bolt from the advancing 
Spheres, however, ended his hesi- 
tancy and he dived out, plunging 
toward the same huge mound on 
which Everard had dropped. 

He was aware of his own voice 
shouting hoarsely throughout the 
vertiginous fall. Then there was 
the soft impact of his body against 
the force structure’s cushioning 
wall of radiance and he slid down 
the slope. It was as though a 
thousand solicitous hands material- 
ized to clutch him by his arms 
and legs and pass him down, one 
to the other, until he reached the 
ground level. 

ID 1 VERARD helped him to his 
feet. He stood staring uncer- 
tainly at the undulant pink force 
stuff of the surface that seemed to 
be rippling around his ankles. 
Glancing about, he surveyed the 
somehow not-quite-orderly ar- 
rangement of huge but squat 
mounds of energy that stretched 
away in all directions, like muskrat 
hills in a swamp. 

“Morning, Everard,” a muffled 
voice called out. “Back already?” 

Bruno’s self-appointed guardian 
turned and addressed the tenuous 
blue wall behind them. “Morning, 



Matt. How’s the missus? Hope we 
didn’t jar you when we dropped 
down.” 

Bruno could make out the shape 
of the man who smiled out at 
them. It was as though he were 
encased in the semi-transparent 
substance of the wall. But he 
didn’t seem to mind his imprison- 
ment. 

“Didn’t touch us,” laughed the 
man called Matt. “But you prob- 
ably shook hell out of old Blub- 
ber Ball’s nerves, if he has any.” 

More faintly, Bruno could see 
the huge Sphere moving around 
beyond the man in what appeared 
to be one of several energy-free 
spaces within the immaterial 
mound. The compartment seemed 
to be furnished with a fantastic 
assortment of odd-shaped and odd- 
sized force of objects. 

Everard chuckled. “Wouldn’t be 
surprised to see old Blubber Ball 
setting more traps from now on. 
This here’s Bruno of the Spruce 
clan. Brought him in from the 
forest.” 

“Spruce? Spruce?” Matt mulled 
over the name. 

“Sure. Hulen’s cousin. You 
know Hulen.” 

Grinning, the other poked his 
head out through the glimmering 
blue material of the wall. “Know 
him well enough to say you should 
have brought him a wife instead 
of a cousin. Needs one to tame 
him down. Hi, Bruno.” 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



15 



“Hi, Matt,” Bruno returned 
weakly. “You — you live in there 
— with that Sphere?” 

“Where else?” 

“Bruno still has to learn the 
ropes.” Everard effected a theat- 
rical sneer. “Then he’s going to 
show us how to communicate with 
the Spheres.” 

Matt snickered. “Aren’t they 
all? Give my regards to Hulen.” 

fT'AKING Bruno by the arm, 
Everard said, “Let’s go. It ain’t 
far from here.” 

Bruno tried to stride off, but 
fell on his face when he couldn’t 
lift his feet out of the radiant pink 
carpet of rubbery force. 

“Don’t walk — just think,” Ever- 
ard explained patiently. “The 
force stuff’ll take care of the rest.” 

Dismayed, Bruno watched the 
old man glide forward without 
moving his feet as the carpet piled 
up at his heels and smoothed out 
in a steady incline before the toes 
of his sandals. Then, even before 
he realized it, he also was gliding 
along. 

“A couple or three more houses 
down is all we have to go,” Ever- 
ard offered encouragingly. 

“These are — houses?” 

“You see the Blubber Balls in 
’em, don’t you?” 

Bruno was aware now that he 
could make out several of the 
spherical forms through the trans- 
parent walls of the mounds. “And 



people live right there too?” 

Everard grimaced disdainfully 
at his bumpkinlike ignorance. “You 
sure got a lot to learn, boy.” 

“How many people live in the 
City?” 

“Thousands. Place is crawling 
with ’em. I expect they’ll have 
some kind of general extermina- 
tion pretty soon now and — watch 
out, boy!” 

Everard planted his hands 
against Bruno’s back and gave 
him a shove. Bruno fell forward, 
skidding across the surface and 
gaining impetus from the accom- 
modating wave of the carpet. 

It wasn’t until after the bolt of 
fierce energy had discharged that 
he realized the purpose behind the 
old man’s rude action. As he 
coasted around behind the closest 
mound, with Everard skimming 
along beside him, he looked back 
and saw the Sphere that had come 
drifting out of one of the struc- 
tures. The bolt had melted the 
energy where it struck, laying bare 
the coarse ground of the plain. 

Safe behind the mound, Everard 
again helped him up. “You got to 
keep your eyes peeled, son, if you 
aim to stay alive around here.” 

Trembling, Bruno started to 
lean back against the wall. 

“No! No!” the old man shouted, 
jerking him away by the arm. 
“Look!” 

With the end of his staff, he 
prodded the section of force ma- 



16 



GALAXY 



terial against which Bruno had 
almost propped his shoulder. Con- 
trasting the even blue radiance of 
the rest of the mound, the small, 
roughly circular section was a 
sparkling red. On touching it, the 
final six inches of the staff’s length 
disintegrated in a shower of hissing 
sparks. 

“Lesson Number One for sur- 
vival,” Everard said grimly. “Don’t 
mess around with no red force 
stuff.” 

The old man moved ten feet 
farther along the wall and stepped 
through, disappearing into the soft 
blue radiance like a figure being 
swallowed by a dense fog. Bruno 
followed. 

I NSIDE, the pleasant warmth of 
the force stuff pressed ten- 
derly against his face and arms 
and set up a myriad tingling, 
soothing sensation all along his 
skin. As though expecting that the 
coalesced energy might impede his 
movements, he went forward, per- 
haps ten feet, with arms out- 
stretched and groping. 

Suddenly he was out of the wall 
again and in one of the inner com- 
partments, standing practically 
face-to-face with a Blubber Ball. 
The Sphere’s surface promptly as- 
sumed the angry appearance of a 
boiling yellow sun. 

Before the discharge came, 
though, Everard’s arm reached out 
and jerked Bruno back into the 

THE CITY OF FORCE 



force structure of the wall. 

“Damned if you ain’t a problem, 
son!” The old man shook his head 
worriedly. “Now, dammit, stick 
close to my heels!” 

As they continued along inside 
the wall, Bruno watched the play 
of ominous light along the Sphere’s 
surface subside. Apparently the 
force material of the building was 
solid to the Blubber Balls, but 
completely immaterial to the hu- 
mans who resided in the mounds 
with them. 

But even that observation, he 
decided, was not altogether cor- 
rect. “Why is it,” he asked, “that 
we can move around in this blue 
stuff as though it wasn’t here, yet 
it was solid enough to break our 
fall from the tube?” 

“This force matter does what 
you want it to — within certain 
limits, anyhow.” 

Bruno nodded pensively. “We 
think about it being hard enough 
to stop our fall and it is? We de- 
cide we want to walk around in it 
and, to us, it becomes as thin as 
air? Is that it?” 

“Right.” 

“Does it do what the Spheres 
want it to, too?” 

Everard continued on around 
inside the curving wall. “Yup. 
Some of it, at least. Never seen 
’em do nothing with the blue stuff. 
But they can make the pink and 
green stuff move ’em around too, 
just like we can.” 



17 



“Don’t you see what that 
means?” Bruno reached forward, 
caught the old man’s arm and 
turned him around. 

“Nope.” 

“The way we think can’t be too 
different from the way they think! 
We think of different things, of 
course, but—” 

“Look, son,” Everard said ir- 
ritably. “For hundreds of years 
we been trying to figure out how 
they think so’s we can get in con- 
tact. I guess everybody except you 
knows it can’t be done.” 

“All this force stuff— what keeps 
it up? Where does it come from?” 

The old man made dismayed 
gestures with his hands. “How 
should I know? Ever hear of an 
airyplane?” 

Bruno was acquainted with the 
legend. “Machines that were sup- 
posed to fly.” 

“Right. Now you figure those 
cockroaches in your village could 
understand what made them ma- 
chines stay up? For that matter, 
think you could understand it?” 

' 1 1 HEY found Hulen in what 

Bruno assumed was the rear 
outer wall of the mound. They had 
come upon an area of impenetrable 
blackness in the force stuff, but 
Everard had waved his hand in 
annoyance and the blue glow had 
extended instantly into the murky 
region. 

Directly ahead was a hill of 



force substance that seemed to be 
a projection of the pink surface. 
There was a cradlelike depression 
in the crest of the elevation and in 
it lay a sleeping form. 

Bruno recognized his cousin and 
went gliding forward eagerly on 
the undulant carpet. “Hulen!” 

The slumbering man, stout and 
with a thick cast of contentment 
on his florid face, stirred lightly 
and mumbled, “Go ’way.” 

Blackness swallowed them. 

But the light returned as Ever- 
ard coasted up to the base of the 
delicately soft elevation. “Wake 
up, Hulen!” 

The man turned over, opened 
his eyes without seeing anything 
and was instantly blotted out by 
returning darkness. 

This time it was Bruno who 
thought Hulen’s artificial night 
away. 

“I’ll fix him,” vowed Everard, 
staring at the comfortable hill on 
which the man slept. Then the 
elevation began melting down, 
flowing back into the pink carpet. 
Bruno’s cousin was deposited on 
his ear. 

Hulen awakened finally, yawned, 
saw Everard and asked, “You got 
my new robe?” 

“Wasn’t ready yet I’ll pick it 
up next time I go out.” 

Hulen sat up scratching his 
head. “What’re you trying to pull 
off, old man? I give you two 
force-food balls to trade off with 



18 



GALAXY 



the forest folks for a new robe and 
you come back—” 

“Brought you a visitor,” Ever- 
ard cut him short, gesturing toward 
Bruno, who had been standing out 
of his cousin’s field of vision. 

Hulen looked around, frown- 
ing momentarily. Then his face 
broke out in a grin of recognition 
as he leaped up and seized Bruno’s 
shoulders. 

“I didn’t figure you’d ever make 
it here, fellow! Welcome to the 
easy life!” 

Bruno returned the special em- 
brace of the Spruce clan. “Didn’t 
come here for the easy life,” he 
said soberly. 

“Oh, no! Not another one!” 
Hulen glanced in distress at 
Everard. 

“Yup. Wants to get chummy 
with the Blubber Balls. Tried to 
talk him out of it, but . .” Ever- 
ard completed the sentence with 
a futile gesture. 

Hulen cuffed Bruno on the arm. 
“We’ll soon get you off it. Just wait 
till you see how swell life can be. 
I know a couple of classy babes— 
Elm clan. You’ve run across that 
brand before, haven’t you?” 

Bruno smiled noncommittally 
as Hulen’s elbow dug into his ribs. 

“Gotta be going,” Everard said. 
“Keep a close eye on him, Hulen. 
He’s a natural-born stumbler. He 
almost got it half a dozen times 
since I picked him up this morn- 
ing.” 



The old man glided off through 
the wall and headed for another 
force structure across the way. 
And Bruno realized, watching the 
robed figure depart, that he was 
seeing outside the mound for the 
first time since he had entered it. 
The wall’s outer surface, like its 
inner one, evidently was opaque 
as long as he felt no desire to 
look beyond it. 

Ill 

T> RUNO and Hulen stood un- 
comfortably for a while, try- 
ing to find something in common 
to talk about. 

“How’re all the folks?” Hulen 
asked at last. 

“Fine,” said Bruno, and thought 
what else he might add. “Just fine.” 
“Old Chief Cedric still in 
charge?” 

“Well — more or less, I guess 
you’d say. He’s been quiet since a 
Sphere came along a couple of 
years ago and tamed him down.” 
“What happened?” 

“Found an old — I believe he 
called it a generator, with instruc- 
tions on how to get it to work. 
There were these two glass things 
that were supposed to light up.” 
“Yes?” Hulen coaxed, laughter 
waiting in his eyes. 

“Well, he got the thing going 
with a hand crank and for a whole 
night it was just like day in his 
hut.” 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



19 



“And then?” 

“This Sphere came along in one 
of those green air tunnels and 
boom! up went the whole hut! 
Cedric was outside at the time, 
but close enough to get his hair 
singed!” 

Hulen laughed until his eyes 
ran. “They’ll do it, all right! They 
just can’t stand anything that 
makes that electricity stuff. That’s 
why they blew hell out of all the 
old cities. The human cities were 
full of electrical things.” 

“Now Cedric has fits whenever 
anybody tries to dig something out 
of one of the ruins.” 

“I can’t say I blame him.” 
Hulen glanced tentatively be- 
hind him and a section of the pink 
carpet flowed upward like a grow- 
ing toadstool. When it attained a 
convenient height and sufficient 
rigidity, he seated himself com- 
fortably upon it. Then he indicated 
a spot behind Bruno where a sec- 
ond mound of force stuff was ris- 
ing. The improvised seat, Bruno 
found, was even softer than it ap- 
peared. 

“You have to learn to do these 
things for yourself,” Hulen said. 
Then, “Seriously, about contacting 
the Blubber Balls — I had the 
same idea at first. That’s why I 
left the clan and came here. I 
was going to say, ‘Look here, 
Spheres, we’re dignified, intelligent 
people. You can’t simply step in 
and take over as though there 



wasn’t an ounce of brains any- 
where on Earth’.” 

“And you gave up when you 
found out you couldn’t get through 
to them?” 

Hulen smiled. “I got wise, 
Cousin. What could be better than 
this?” He spread a hand to in- 
clude all the wonderful effects of 
the City of Force. And everywhere 
the hand swept, the outer surface 
of the wall beyond it became 
transparent, laying bare the splen- 
did panorama of the City’s magnifi- 
cent edifices. 

Bruno sprang up. “What’s that?” 
he asked anxiously, pointing out- 
side. 

Thousands of fluttering ribbons 
of silver were extending upward 
from each immaterial structure, 
reaching eagerly toward the noon- 
day sun. 

Hulen laughed at his country 
cousin’s alarm. “Nothing to be 
afraid of. Watch.” ' 

' I ' HE ribbons seemed to be draw- 

ing something out of the sun- 
light — tiny beads of pure yellow 
energy that formed along the 
length of the streamers and rolled 
slowly down until they embedded 
themselves in the force substance 
of the buildings. Gradually the 
beads rolled together, forming 
balls of increasing size as they 
sank farther into the walls. 

Bruno constricted his vision and 
cut out the exterior scene. Now 



20 



GALAXY 



he was watching the orbs course 
through the material of their own 
mound. Still collecting into big- 
ger balls, they continued moving 
inward until they came to rest em- 
bedded in the inner surface of the 
walls, protruding into the alien’s 
compartments. 

One floated close by Bruno’s 
head 'and he ducked. But Hulen 
only laughed and snatched it out 
of the air. He handed it to his 
cousin and trapped another for 
himself. 

Bruno cautiously handled the 
glowing yellow orb, acutely aware 
of intense sensation in the palms 
of his hands, in his fingers. It was 
a soothing, comfortable feeling of 
fullness and satisfaction that spread 
up his arms and into his shoulders 
as the grapefruit-sized ball began 
shrinking. 

Dumfounded, he held the thing 
in one hand and raised the other 
incredulously to his face. And 
where his fingers brushed against 
his lips, there was the composite 
taste of all the good food he had 
ever eaten, of the best of the 
Grape clan’s wine he had ever 
drunk. 

Wt 1 ORCE-FOOD balls,” Hulen 
explained, vigorously rolling 
the rapidly dwindling orb between 
his hands and plopping what was 
left of it into his mouth. “Y ou don’t 
have to eat them, but they taste 
even better this way.” 



Bruno realized that until then 
he had been both thirsty and hun- 
gry, and now there was only a feel- 
ing of very comfortably satisfied 
well-being. 

“Blubber Ball really goes for 
them too.” Hulen gestured with 
a casual thumb. 

When Bruno looked, the inner 
surface of the wall was transparent 
and, in the compartment beyond, 
the twenty-foot Sphere was drift- 
ing along, absorbing each force- 
food ball with which it came into 
contact. 

The sight of the alien reminded 
him of his resolve and he rode 
the wavering pink carpet toward 
the compartment 

But his cousin Hulen darted 
around in front of him. “Where do 
you think you’re going?” 

“I came here to communicate 
with them. This one’s as good as 
any for a start.” 

Hulen put an arm around his 
shoulder. “You’ve come a long 
way and had a lot of new experi- 
ences. Why don’t you get a little 
rest first?” 

A hill of pink fluffiness reared 
up from the floor and formed an 
inviting depression in its crest. It 
was, Bruno admitted, a good sug- 
gestion. He did feel tired. Even 
before he fully decided, however, 
a wave of radiant force billowed 
behind him, rolled him up the soft 
ramp and deposited him on the 
cloudlike bed. 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



21 



D OUSED finally by the sound 
of amused voices, Bruno ele- 
vated himself on an elbow. Glanc- 
ing downhill, he saw Hulen sitting 
at a mushroom-shaped table which 
had sprouted from the glistening 
floor. Across from him were two 
girls whose uninhibited laughter 
filled the inner-wall cavity. 

Hulen stared down and a sec- 
tion of the lambent carpet rolled 
back, bearing a small subsurface 
compartment in which were stored 
several force-food balls. He handed 
one to each of the girls. Then he 
raised a third above his upturned 
face and squeezed it like a grape- 
fruit. A maroon liquid flowed into 
his waiting mouth. 

He saw his cousin and rose. 
“Come on down,” he invited. “We 
got company.” 

When Bruno hesitated, the 
mound deflated under him and he 
pawed the air frenziedly on his 
way down to the floor. The girls’ 
high-pitched laughter italicized 
Hulen’s guffaws. 

He tossed one of the force-food 
balls into Bruno’s lap. “Some of 
the best stuff you ever drank. I 
spent all afternoon thinking up a 
storm — impressing the taste of 
claret on it.” 

Bruno raised the ball, squeezed 
it and drank. It was delicious. 

Hulen came over and slapped 
him on rthe back. “See what I 
mean about the lush life?” He 
winked at the girls. 



They were blondes — a general 
trait of the Elm clan, Bruno re- 
membered. Both were attractive 
and rather well put together, their 
figures being allowed some free- 
dom of expression by virtue of 
sleeveless, low-cut robes and broad, 
constricting belts. A little plump, 
perhaps, but not so much so that 
a couple of months in a forest vil- 
lage wouldn’t harden them up and 
slim them down. 

“Bruno, meet Lea and Sal. Girls, 
my cousin Bruno. He’ll be a regu- 
lar cosmopolitan as soon as he 
shakes the hayseed out of his hair.” 

Both girls gave out with delight- 
ful laughter. Sal’s, however, was 
more restrained, somewhat less de- 
risive and a bit more sympathetic 
than Lea’s. Moreover, Sal re- 
garded him with interested con- 
cern rather than pure amusement. 
He decided he liked her better 
and went and sat beside her. Hu- 
len, too, seemed satisfied with the 
arrangement. It was clear that he 
preferred someone high-spirited, as 
Lea seemed to be. 

“Hulen says you’re going to con- 
tact the Blubbers,” said Lea, a 
tinge of mockery in her voice. 

But Bruno only nodded. 

“It won’t be easy,” Sal said quite 
seriously. 

Hulen smote him again on the 
shoulder. “We’ll get it out of his 
system, won’t we, girls? A few 
days of the easy life is all it’ll 
take.”

GALAXY 



L EA leaned forward on the table. 

“You never had it so good, 
Bus—” Obviously she had started 
to call him Buster, but had stopped 
to grope for a more practical word 
as she regarded his lean, sinewy 
arms. “You never had it so good, 
kid.” 

Bruno realized that Buster 
would probably be an appropriate 
name for anyone living in the City 
of Force. The easy life, with its 
complete absence of effort, must 
indeed be conducive to chubbi- 
ness. 

“Just take it easy, Bruno.” Sal 
laid a hand on his forearm. “Keep 
your eyes open and watch. Learn 
all you can before you try to glide 
off on your own. After a few weeks, 
you’ll know what you want to do.” 
She was quite young, too, he 
decided — a good deal younger 
than the other Elmite. Somehow 
he had the notion she hadn’t been 
in the City too long. There wasn’t 
the same casualness that he’d 
found in the others he’d encoun- 
tered. 

“We’ll change your mind, Cuz,” 
Hulen promised jovially. “After 
we get through showing you how 
rich life can be, you’ll start pray- 
ing that nobody ever succeeds in 
contacting the Spheres and getting 
them to go back where they came 
from.” 

Sal fastened her eyes on the 
surface of the pink table and a 
projection of force stuff shot up- 



ward, shaping itself into a goblet. 
She squeezed the food ball over 
the container and filled it to the 
brim. 

Hulen tilted his head back again 
and compressed what was left of 
his globe into a final trickle of 
wine. He rolled back the carpet 
with a brief glance and grimaced 
when he saw that the cache was 
already empty, the last of the balls 
having gone to his cousin. 

“Have to round up some more,” 
he said disappointedly. 

Bruno, however, was just then 
looking at several of the bright 
golden orbs. He had extended his 
vision curiously into the Blubber 
thing’s inner compartment and had 
spotted the cluster embedded in 
the wall. 

“I’ll take care of it,” he said 
confidently, letting the wavering 
floor carry him through the inner 
surface of the wall and into the 
huge room. He stood on his toes 
and reached for the food balls. 

But a hurtling form came div- 
ing through the wall and he looked 
down in time to see Sal’s shoul- 
der ramming into his stomach. 
The breath knocked out of him, he 
flailed backward across the com- 
partment and collapsed, a billow of 
the carpet surging up to break his 
fall. 

Sal, off balance, plunged down 
on top of him. 

“It’s a trap, Bruno!” she 
shouted. “Don’t touch it!” 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



23 



IV 



Hulen and Lea were in the com- 
partment by now. “Boy, is he ever 
a rube,” she said disparagingly. 

“Watch, Cousin,” Hulen in- 
structed, “and you’ll learn Lesson 
Number Two for survival.” 

He fashioned a pellet of pink 
stuff from the material of the floor 
and hurled it at the cluster of food 
balls. 

As it sailed toward the tar- 
get, Bruno noticed the tiny spot 
of red radiance, almost completely 
hidden by the orbs. The pellet 
struck the lowest ball and the con- 
cealed crimson globule exploded 
into a blinding flame that surged 
through half the room before it 
extinguished itself. 

“Bruno,” Sal said patiently, let- 
ting a ground swell of the floor 
form under her back and lift her 
to her feet, “you’ve got to be more 
careful. You can’t go bungling 
around and expect to live very 
long in the City.” 

She said it, Bruno imagined, as 
though she were more than casu- 
ally interested in his survival. Yet 
the fact that he had to take criti- 
cism from a girl was an embarrass- 
ment. 

He started to get off the floor 
and two projections of force stuff 
reared up, each wedging itself 
crutchlike under one of his arms 
and providing assistance as they 
continued to rise. Angrily, though, 
he batted the props away and got 
up under his own power. 

24 



r 1 1 HE near disaster not only 
broke up the party, but also 
brought about postponement of a 
nocturnal tour of the City which, 
in Sal’s words, would have 
“brought out the wonderful beau- 
ty of the force lights.” 

Although the experience had 
shaken Bruno’s determination and 
confidence, by the next morning 
he nevertheless felt somewhat re- 
dedicated to his purpose of com- 
municating with the Spheres. He 
was about to enlist his cousin 
Hulen’s advice on the matter when 
Everard came gliding in through 
the outer wall. 

“Morning, fellows.” The old man 
straightened the folds of his robe 
and scowled at Bruno. “Just heard 
about your close shave. Ain’t you 
learned nothing yet?” 

Hulen laughed. “He learned a 
lot last night, didn’t you, Cuz?” 
Bruno looked away uncomfort- 
ably. 

“Don’t feel bad,” Hulen reas- 
sured him. “I had as much trouble 
myself when I first came here.” 
“They all do,” Everard admitted 
grudgingly. “But the easy life is 
well worth it.” 

Hulen ordered up three stools 
from the force material of the 
floor and sat facing his relative. 
“Lopk, here are some thumb rules: 
The pink and green and blue stuff 
— they’re all okay. Anything bright 



GALAXY 



red is deadly. Purple’ll knock hell 
out of you, but it’s usually not 
fatal.” 

“Orange is rough too,” the old 
man added, digging with one hand 
inside his robe. “It’ll reach out 
after you and . .” He drew a fin- 
ger demonstrably across his neck. 

Continuing the search of his 
clothes, he produced three food 
balls from an inner pouch and 
shared them with the other two 
men. “Figured you’d be out of 
provisions, so I brought along some 
breakfast.” 

Bruno munched avidly on the 
glowing yellow orb, determined 
this time not to have it melt in 
his hands. The taste was curious- 
ly like that of bacon and eggs, hot 
buttered biscuits and rich milk, all 
rolled into each mouthful. And he 
could actually feel the composite 
flavor spreading through his body. 

There was no doubt about it, he 
uneasily conceded — this was the 
ideal life in many respects. The 
temperature was always perfect 
(he wondered to what extent men- 
tal control governed that com- 
fort) and one’s clothes seemed 
never to get soiled. Only a half- 
hour earlier, Hulen had shown 
him how proper concentration 
could make the entire outer sur- 
face of the mound ice cold, and 
how the water that condensed on 
it could be channeled into a tub- 
like depression in the wall’s in- 
terior. 

THE CITY OF FORCE 



Indeed, it was the easy life, re- 
quiring no exertion except defen- 
sive maneuvers whenever an alien 
happened along. And he could 
see that one would rarely be 
caught in a perilous situation with 
just a little more caution than he 
had learned in the forest. 

B RUNO glanced around, ex- 
tending his vision beyond the 
inner surface of the wall. One of 
the Spheres was in the nearest 
compartment. He watched it glide 
over to a cube of orange force. The 
color of the object seemed to flow 
into the Sphere. When only a gray 
form was left, the alien deserted 
the cube and coasted to the center 
of the compartment, where it drew 
up beside a fountain of splashing 
white sparks. The orange hue 
which had once belonged to the 
cube drained from the surface of 
the Sphere and became part of the 
fountain. 

The purpose of the function — 
or ritual? — escaped Bruno com- 
pletely. He saw there would be 
no point in even attempting to 
understand what he had wit- 
nessed. 

“Eat up,” Hulen said, gesturing 
toward what was left of the food 
ball in Bruno’s hand. “I got a 
program mapped out. We’re go- 
ing to pick up the girls and show 
you some of the sights.” 

Everard sighed. “Let’s me out.” 
“Why?” Bruno wanted to know. 

25 



He was becoming fond of the little 
man, despite his cynical criticism. 

“We never take the chance of 
letting ’em find more’n four of 
us together at one time, else they 
might get the idea we’re running 
away with the place. That’d mean 
another extermination.” 

Bruno glanced back at the 
Sphere in the adjacent compart- 
ment. “You go along with them, 
Everard. I’m staying.” 

Hulen and the old man ex- 
changed uncertain looks. “Why?” 
they both asked. 

“I’m going to be busy. I don’t 
feel I’m accomplishing anything.” 
“You’re not supposed to accom- 
plish anything!” Hulen pointed 
out. “This is the easy life. There’s 
nothing to do, nothing to worry 
about — if you watch your step. 
Just relax and enjoy things.” 
“Don’t have to put out no ef- 
fort here,” Everard said, further 
defining this strange new philoso- 
phy of existence. “Nobody in all 
history never had a better deal. 
Talk about that the welfare state 
of the Budding Ages—” 

“You fellows go ahead,” Bruno 
insisted. “I have something to do.” 
“But Sal’s expecting you!” 
Hulen said. “She’s the one who 
planned the tour!” 

The setup became even clearer, 
as far as Bruno was concerned. 
Apparently it was all a conspiracy 
to get his mind off communicating 
with the Spheres. It was all for 

26 



his benefit, of course. But he didn’t 
need them to look out for him. 

“Tell Sal I’ll see her later,” he 
said firmly. 

VERARD’S direct stare was 
intense with suspicion. “What 
are you going to do?” 

“I came here to reach the 
Spheres. I may as well get along 
with the job. And here’s as good 
a place as any to start.” Bruno 
indicated the alien in the nearest 
compartment. 

Everard lifted an eyebrow. 
“Just what have you got in mind?” 

“Finding some way to talk with 
them — telling them we’re intelli- 
gent too.” 

“Don’t you suppose that if we 
were intelligent by their standards, 
they would have found it out by 
now?” 

“Maybe they already know 
we’re intelligent,” Hulen suggested. 

“They can’t,” Bruno said, “or 
they’d have respect for other think- 
ing things.” 

“How do we know that they 
think?” Everard asked. 

It had developed into a rapid- 
fire question-and-answer session, 
and Bruno wondered whether it 
might not be intended solely to 
confuse him. He ignored the old 
man’s last question and said, “I 
don’t think they’d treat us like 
pests if they knew we were a 
civilized race. They’d—” 

“Ain’t every creature civilized 



GALAXY 



by its own standards?” Everard in- 
terrupted. 

“They destroyed all our cities,” 
Bruno went on, “because our cities 
were nests of forces that clashed 
in some way with their own setup, 
or with the Spheres themselves. 
It’s just like when we kill mosqui- 
toes because they interfere with 
us.” 

Everard frowned. “I don’t get 
it” 

“Don’t you see that if we ever 
found intelligent mosquitoes— talk- 
ing mosquitoes — we wouldn’t de- 
stroy them? Instead, we’d tell them 
we don’t like to be buzzed and bit- 
ten. We’d lay down the law — 
give them a list of terms they’d 
have to meet if they wanted us to 
stop swatting them. We might 
even help them after that.” 

“But we can’t contact the 
Spheres!” Hulen sputtered. “Would 
we notice a particular ant on the 
ground if it tried to communicate 
with us?” 

“Maybe, if it tried hard enough. 
Since it would be the one trying to 
establish contact, it would have 
to discover the symbols that would 
do the trick.” 

Everard laughed jeeringly. “And 
you’re going to look for symbols 
that’ll let us talk with the Blub- 
ber Balls?” 

“I think maybe some of the geo- 
metrical forms they’re familiar 
with might work.” 

“So,” Hulen said, with a dis- 



dainful grin, “Old Blubber Ball’s 
going to see you making with some 
geometrical lingo and he’s going 
to sit down respectfully and watch. 
Let me ask you this: Do you think 
a parrot’s intelligent just because 
it can imitate human speech?” 

Bruno rose impatiently. “Just 
the same, I’m going to give it a 
try.” He let the now wavering floor 
push him along swiftly toward the 
inner wall. 

His cousin glided ahead to block 
his path before he could pass 
through into the inner compart- 
ment. 

But Everard shot forward and a 
projection of force material sprang 
up to seize Hulen’s arm. “Let him 
go. If he wants to be a dumb 
hick, let him find out for himself— 
if he lives that long.” 

T> RUNO stood gaping up at the 
huge alien, but only for a 
second. When he saw its surface 
cloud over with a threatening play 
of sparkling yellow force, he 
hopped sideways and let the 
radiant carpet carry him several 
feet to the rear. The maneuver was 
executed just in time to escape 
the Sphere’s first searing blast of 
lancelike force, which curled back 
the material of the floor where it 
struck. 

Still taking evasive action, both 
under his own power and with the 
help of the motile carpet of force, 
he concentrated on piling up a 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



27 



heap of energy material in the cen- 
ter of the room next to the Sphere. 
Another bolt barely missed him 
before he could manage sufficient 
concentration to mold the force 
stuff in a four-foot tube. 

Stalking him, the alien drifted 
ominously forward. But Bruno, 
bobbing and weaving, prevented 
the Sphere from getting set for an 
effective shot. And all the while he 
kept his eyes on the other objects 
in the room, making certain he 
wasn’t blundering into any of the 
red, purple or orange force things. 

Another streak of jagged energy 
leaped from the Sphere but missed 
by a considerable margin. Follow- 
ing the discharge, Bruno realized, 
it would be at least several sec- 
onds before the alien could gener- 
ate sufficient energy for the next 
searing blast. So he returned to 
his task of constructing symbols 
of communication. 

Glancing back toward the cube 
he had formed, he concentrated on 
a nearby section of the pink floor- 
ing. Like a geyser in slow motion, 
the pastel carpet flowed upward, 
assuming the shape of a lumpy 
ball. He smoothed out its surface 
and snipped off the thin stem. To 
his surprise, the weightless mass 
remained suspended. 

As the alien paused before the 
two objects, Bruno glided around 
the room, making the undulating 
surface carry him left, forward, 
back, right in as random a pattern 



as he could manage to make it 

The Sphere loosed another inef- 
fectual bolt that tore the top off 
the fountain of silver sparks and 
sent the coruscating material 
spraying against the far wall. It 
trickled down the blue surface like 
stars flowing across the velvet of 
space. 

Bruno maneuvered skillfully 
toward the center of the room, 
carefully avoiding a miniature 
waterfall of intense red radiance 
that gushed forth from nowhere, j 
The cataract changed color as it 
spilled down upon and became 
part of the pink carpet, flowing 
outward in concentric wavelets. At 
the point where the red force ma- 
terialized from nothing were a 
large ring of yellow energy and 
a smaller halo of glittering green 
substance. 

He returned his attention to the 
two geometrical forms he had con- 
structed and began molding a 
third — a pyramid. With this crea- 
tion, though, he tried another in- j 
novation. While he fashioned it, 
he concentrated on a different ; 
color. And as the pink hue faded 
from the form, it was replaced by i 
a golden yellow cast. 

This object, too, he left sus- 
pended while he mentally detached 
the cube from the floor and ele- 
vated it to the height of the first 
form. 

Apparently, he summed up, not 
only could the force substance be 




29 




changed from one kind of energy, 
or one color, to another, but it 
could also be shaped into any 
form and moved about in any di- 
rection or at any speed. 

Bruno glanced back through the 
wall and saw Hulen shaking his 
head while Everard watched with 
a disdaining interest. 

The stalking Sphere had, by 
now, generated almost enough 
power for another discharge. Its 
surface was ablaze with restless 
energy that crackled and threw off 
a myriad scintillating sparks. 

Only this time the alien hurled 
not one but two bolts of destruc- 
tive force. Bruno easily managed 
to escape the first. But the sec- 
ond released its full fury on the 
three geometrical forms he had 
constructed. They disintegrated, 
scattering bits of the yellow 
pyramid and the pink cube and 
ball about the room. 

Again the Sphere began its 
stealthy advance and Bruno gave 
way warily. He didn’t see the 
orange cylinder until he had al- 
most backed into it. By then it 
was too late, for already it was 
spewing out a spray of solid light. 
As the meshlike substance en- 
snared him, searing pain stabbed 
deep into his consciousness, bring- 
ing down a curtain of blackness. 

^ Z" 1 OME out of it, Bruno!” Hul- 

^ en’s voice, booming in his 
ear, jarred him back to wakeful- 

30 



ness. He lay on an elevation in 
his cousin’s quarters. 

“You okay?” Everard asked. 

Bruno groaned and rolled over. 
He was aware of a slight blister- 
ing sensation along his left arm, 
the one that had been next to the 
cylinder of orange force. His robe 
was charred and there was the bit- 
ing smell of burned hair about his 
head. 

The force substance beneath his 
back reared up slowly, elevating 
him to a sitting position. A solici- 
tous hand materialized from the 
pastel matter of the mound and 
tenderly explored his aching arm. 
“I— I— Damn! What happened?” 

“You stumbled into some of 
that orange stuff,” Everard ex- 
plained. “Told you to watch out 
for it.” 

“Ol’ Blubber took another whack 
at you after you passed out,” added 
Hulen. “But we pulled you put in 
time.” 

Bruno looked into the inner 
compartment The Sphere having 
gone, it was now dominated by 
the red cataract that flowed out 
of the air between the yellow and 
green rings. Fragments of his 
pyramid, cube and ball were still 
plastered against the wall. 

Everard laughed, derisively. 
“Now that you’ve — ah — con- 
tacted the Sphere, what did he 
tell you?” 

Hulen roared in raucous amuse- 
ment. 



GALAXY 



Bruno managed a weak grin. 
“Guess it wasn’t such a good idea. 
But did you notice the three forms 
I used to get his attention?” 

“What about them?” Hulen 
asked. 

“I made them float. I even 
changed the color of the pyramid. 

“So?” Everard raised a patient- 
ly inquiring eyebrow. 

“I haven’t seen anybody do any- 
thing like that with the force sub- 
stance.” 

Hulen shrugged. “So you did 
something different. So what?” 
“Hasn’t anybody thought of 
studying the stuff — seeing just 
what can be done with it?” 

Everard said irritably. “Look, 
son. We know what we got here. 
It suits us fine. None of us plan 
to go around experimenting to get 
something better. Might mess 
things up.” 

Nodding severely, Hulen said, 
“Everard’s right. Keep away from 
that experimental nonsense. Leave 
things like they are. We got it per- 
fect here. Understand?” 

Bruno’s thoughtful silence was 
apparently interpreted as acquies- 
cence and the other two resumed 
their chuckling. 

Regarding his cousin’s singed 
robe, Hulen peeled back a section 
of the flooring and dug out an- 
other garment. “This’ll keep you 
covered till we make a food-ball 
trade with the forest folks.” 

Bruno rose beside the mound on 



which he had been lying. More 
pink arms than were needed 
sprouted out of the elevation to 
help him change into the new 
robe. 

“Still want to talk with the 
Spheres?” asked Everard. 

“I see where I made my mis- 
take.” 

“Yeah?” Hulen prompted. 

“It was foolish to try to contact 
just any Sphere.” 

“How do you figure that?” Ever- 
ard wanted to know. “What makes 
you think you wouldn’t get the 
same treatment from all of them?” 

“Let’s go back to the example of 
the make-believe ant. Its chances 
would be pretty slim if it tried to 
communicate with just any hu- 
man.” 

“Why?” Hulen leaned forward 
interestedly. 

“Because it might accidentally 
select, say, a fussy old woman, or 
a two-year-old kid, maybe even a 
drunk or a psycho. What chance 
would it have then? But if it found 
somebody in authority—” 

“Oh, hell!” Everard broke in. 
“Let’s forget about the Spheres.” 

V 

B RUNO could well appreciate 
the possibilities of force ma- 
terial that reacted to individual 
thought, becoming opaque or trans- 
parent as one wished. Neverthe- 
less, he turned his back on the 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



31 



huge mound and modestly re- 
garded, instead, the clear night 
sky that shrank before the bril- 
liant display of lambent energy 
emanating from all immaterial ob- 
jects of the City. 

Hulen, less patient and certain- 
ly less inhibited, continued to stare 
into the mound as he called out 
boisterously for Lea and Sal to 
hurry it up for their night out on 
the City. 

An elderly man poked his head 
through the wall of the adjacent 
structure. “Knock it off! We’re 
trying to get some sleep!” 

Another pair of shoulders and 
head popped out the side of a 
second mound. “Quiet! What’s all 
the commotion out there?” 

Hulen lowered his voice and 
cupped his hands. But before he 
could call out again, the two girls 
came gliding through the radiant 
wall. 

“Now,” Sal said consolingly, 
“that didn’t take too long, did it?” 
Her hair was swept up into a 
double braid that wound around 
her head like a garland. It gave 
a classic appearance to her smooth 
face and Bruno eagerly extended 
his arm. He realized now that she 
had seemed a bit plump only in 
comparison with the inordinately 
thin girls of his own clan. And for 
a moment he wistfully wondered 
how it would be living permanent- 
ly in the City of Force and enjoy- 
ing all the luxuries and adventures 



— sharing them all with Sal. 

“What’ll it be tonight, boys?” 
Lea asked, her brassy voice cut- 
ting off his line of thought. 

Grinning, Hulen faced Bruno. 
“Ever hear of an automobile?” 

Bruno dredged up the informa- 
tion from his school days: “Four- 
wheeled contraption that went un- 
der its own power. Saw the ruins 
of one once.” 

“Well, we’re going to get around 
tonight in the next best thing.” 
Hulen rubbed his hands together 
expectantly. “As a matter of fact, 
it might even be better than an 
automobile. Who knows?” 

“Oh, that’ll be fun,” said Lea 
flatly, conveying the impression 
that this wouldn’t be their first 
experience with such a device. 

Hulen waved his arms and a 
section of the radiant surface be- 
gan reacting to the matrixlike in- 
fluence of his thoughts. Two broad 
benches formed, one in front of the 
other, and they both developed 
wide, slanting backs. 

Hulen extended a hand inviting- 
ly and ushered Bruno and Sal into 
the rear seat. He and Lea took 
the one in front. “I’ll drive,” he 
said, and gave Bruno a wink. 

A parapet, shoulder high, reared 
up all around them and Sal 
squealed, “Away we go!” 

URIOUSLY, Bruno watched 
^ the force stuff ahead of the 
vehicle flow up into the forward

GALAXY 



parapet, work its way down onto 
the floor of the automobile, up 
and over the front seat, up and 
over the back seat and out over 
the rear parapet. And all the while 
the shape of the wheelless vehicle 
_ not the car itself - moved for- 
ward, carrying the occupants along 
with it as it gained speed. 

The automobile, Bruno realized, 
was like a wave spreading across 
the surface of a pond. The water 
itself didn’t move forward; its con- 
figuration did. He and Hulen and 
the girls were part of the wave 
and were being swept along with 
it, wholly undisturbed by the com- 
pletely frictionless flow of force 
stuff beneath their bodies. 

The car, under Hulen’s direc- 
tion, went streaking past row after 
row of gigantic force mounds, 
swerving between pylons and 
spires and sparkling fountains, 
darting under tunnels of glimmer- 
ing green-light stuff, curving around 
ponderous and magnificent edi- 
fices of unfamiliar geometrical de- 
sign and altogether new concepts 
of color. 

Occasionally, they zipped past a 
Sphere or a group of them mov- 
ing along the broad, level ways be- 
tween the force buildings. Twice 
Hulen sent the automobile in loop- 
ing circles around one of the aliens 
and zipping in between the ranks 
of several of them. He drew a bolt 
of destructive energy from a par- 
ticularly irate Sphere, but it missed 



by no less than a hundred feet. 

“No danger here,” he reassured 
his passengers. “They couldn’t be- 
gin to keep up with our speed.” 

Lea, acting frightened and en- 
joying every fninute of it, moved 
closer to Hulen and clung to his 
neck while he laughed like a 
youngster bedeviling grownups. 

Sal held a firm grip on Bruno’s 
arm and kept her face close against 
his shoulders to avoid swaying 
with the motions of the careening 
car. 

To Bruno, the novel experience 
was an utter delight as the wind 
whipped his robe about him and 
sportively mussed his hair. The 
speed was incredible — easily two 
or three times as fast as he had 
ever gone before, even on the 
back of the Spruce clan’s swift- 
est horse. 

“How about it, Cuz?” Hulen 
shouted boastfully above the roar 
of the wind. “Won’t find anything 
like this in the clan areas, eh?” 

B RUNO tried to answer, but all 
he could manage in the face 
of the wind was an expressionless 
gulp. 

“This is only one of the things 
we do for fun,” Hulen went on ef- 
fusively. “Of course it takes a lot 
of practice to do this stunt, but 
you’ll learn.” 

He produced a food ball for 
each and passed them around. “I 
decided on brandy for tonight. 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



33 



Take a taste and tell me what you 
think.” 

As Bruno expected, it was ex- 
cellent. But he retreated guardedly 
into his thoughts. It was clear 
enough that an intensive campaign 
was under way to win him over 
to their way of life, and for the 
moment he couldn’t blame them. 
In many respects, for those lucky 
enough to be living in Cities of 
Force, it was Utopia. 

Sal set her liquor ball on the 
seat beside her and retrieved her 
grip on his arm. “What did you 
do in the Spruce village, Bruno?” 

“Farmed. Had a place on the 
outskirts, not too far from the mar- 
ket area.” 

“It’s fun doing things with the 
soil, isn’t it?” 

“I enjoyed it.” He wondered 
why he had put the verb in the 
past tense. 

“You don’t ever see any soil 
around here, unless you peel back 
all the pink stuff underfoot. Then 
you find nothing but rocks.” 

“Don’t you like it here?” He 
studied her face, brilliantly illu- 
minated by the intense light radi- 
ating from the force edifices all 
around them. 

Her eyes, however, were focused 
on something remote. “Of course 
I do. It’s the soft life, isn’t it? What 
could be better?” 

Yet she didn’t sound too con- 
vinced. 

“I’ve plenty of friends here 



now,” she went on. “It shouldn’t 
be too long before I decide to set 
up moundkeeping on my own and 
get on with my job of raising a 
family.” 

“With one of those friends?” 

“Not necessarily.” 

HP HE car tilted backward sharp- 
ly and Bruno’s gangly legs 
came up from the floor as though 
defying gravity. He reached for- 
ward frantically and seized the 
front seat to keep from tumbling 
out the rear. Sal gasped and strug- 
gled through a busy few seconds, 
clinging more frenziedly to him 
and trying to pull her robe down 
over her legs at the same time. 

Then Bruno noticed that the 
color of the force stuff flowing up 
from the surface ahead to take the 
shape of the speeding car was no 
longer the pastel pink that it had 
been. Now it was a light blue. 

After he had steadied himself 
with one hand and secured a pro- 
tective grip around the girl’s shoul- 
der with the other, he glanced 
around. They were climbing the 
steep face of a huge pylon that 
dwarfed all the other force edi- 
fices of the City. It reared so high 
above the other structures that it 
would have lost itself in the black- 
ness of night, had it not carried 
its own soft effulgence along with 
it. 

They swept past a towering 
fountain of inchoate green energy 



34 



GALAXY 



that gushed out the side of the 
structure and sent its flowing 
{liquid force splattering down the 



f 



slope, emitting coruscating emer- 



ald sparks all the way to the 
surface. 

Hulen turned around, grinning 
at his cousin’s dismay. “Over the 
top we go,” he shouted gleefully. 
“—And here we are!” 

The car leveled off abruptly and 
jerked to a halt on a small, flat 
surface that capped the crest of 
the pylon. Bruno, relaxing his grip 
too soon, went flying past the front 
seat and shot through the air, 
plunging over the brink ahead. 

But an alert arm of blue force 
stuff shot out the side of the struc- 
ture and wrapped itself around his 
■\yaist as he started the terrifying 
sjlide down the slope. It lifted him 
gently back to the top and set him 
down beside Hulen and the girls. 

Like rapidly melting lumps of 
ice, the form of the automobile 
shrank and lost itself in the level 

t op of the pylon. In its place, Hul- 
n ordered up a table and chairs 
and spread several liquor balls 
out before them. The small orbs 
glowed like golden apples and 
their radiance blended elegantly 
with the pastel-blue luster of their 
setting. 

A cool breeze drifted out of the 
star-filled sky and spilled over the 
brink of the pylon, to go cascad- 
ing down on all the lesser force 
Structures of the iridescent City 

T 



the city of force 



of light. And Bruno let his eyes 
rove over the smaller, irregular 
hills and mounds, the cubes and 
fountains, the serpentine tunnels, 
the pyramids and truncated cylin- 
ders of coruscating energy. Beyond 

— beyond the magnificent pattern 
of metropolitan lights — stretched 
the dark, dismal plain. Out there 
it seemed like another world. 

“Still think the clan life has 
anything to offer?” Hulen prodded. 

“Nothing like this,” Bruno ad- 
mitted. “I nevei thought anything 
could be so — luxurious.” 

TTUMAN cities, too, he under- 
stood, had arrogantly pre- 
sented blazing shields of light to 
the night sky. But underneath 
those lights had been the solid 
matter that produced them. Un- 
derneath these was only more light 

— and uncanny force matter that 
became almost anything you 
wanted it to be. 

“This is just a small town,” Lea 
said casually. “I know someone 
who went through a green tunnel 
to one of the other Force Cities. 
It’s ten times bigger than this 
one.” 

“Where is it?” Sal asked, inter- 
ested. 

“Know the Mississippi?” 

“I studied about it.” 

“Well, it’s not too far from the 
mouth of the river and it’s got . .” 

Bruno, whose eyes were becom- 
ing accustomed to the splendid 

35 



display of illumination, lost inter- 
est in the conversation and stared 
down on the rest of the City. Now 
he could see some of the humans. 

There was another party of four 
atop a truncated pyramid a short 
distance to the south. Closer, off 
to his left, two men and a girl had 
constructed a table upon a bulky 
silver cube. Three parties of four, 
spaced at intervals of about a 
block, went shooting down the 
shaft of an otherwise deserted 
chute that spiraled around the 
base of a shining gray obelisk. Be- 
low, next to the bottom of their 
own towering pylon, a huge cloud 
of pink stuff went drifting by. 
Comfortably seated on its soft- 
ness were a man and woman and 
two children. 

There were only a few alien 
Spheres here and there. For the 
most part, their movements were 
confined to the surface below or 
to the curving chutes of green 
light. And they seemed never to 
notice the humans. 

“This building we’re on,” Bruno 
asked, “what is it?” 

Hulen grinned. “Could be their 
city hall — that’s what you might 
call it, I mean.” 

He looked away, then snapped 
his eyes suspiciously back on 
Bruno. “Say, you’re not still think- 
ing about that damned-fool plan 
of contacting the chief Sphere, are 
you?” 

As a matter of fact, Bruno 



wasn’t. He had been, until a mo- 
ment earlier, but now his gaze was 
fastened on a great waterfall of 
radiant energy that dominated the 
City south of the central pylon. 



C ascading down from the 

blackness of night, the crim- 
son cataract seemed to be replen- 
ishing the immaterial substance of 
the force structures, flowing into 
and assuming the color of the 
green chutes and the pink surface, 
the blue mounds, the silver cubes 
and the orange cylinders. 

It was as though the very es- 
sence of the alien City were pour- 
ing out of nowhere, spilling in from 
some unguessable source in an- 
other world, another universe. And 
its point of entry was the mouth 
of a large yellow ring and a small- 
er green one that hung, one with- 
in the other, above the apex of the 
cataract. 

It was the same arrangement 
he had seen in the mound’s inner 
compartment when he had tried tc | 
communicate with the Sphere. And 
now, as he scanned the City, he 
noticed the lesser crimson water-] 
falls, each surmounted by its pair 
of yellow and green rings that 
were suspended motionlessly. 

“I said,” Hulen repeated, “you’re 
not still thinking about contacting 
the Spheres, are you?” 

Sal, too, seemed to be awaiting 
Bruno’s answer, her eyes fixed on 
his lips. 



36 



GALAXY 



Absently, Bruno said, “That’s 
what I came here for.” 

But all the while he was staring 
beyond the table, concentrating on 
the force material of the pylon’s 
surface. He mentally ordered up 
a slender projection of the pale 
blue substance, detached it and 
formed it into a ring, changing its 
color to a soft yellow. 

“He’s certainly obstinate,” Lea 
observed, peevishly lowering her 
chin onto a handlike projection of 
blue force stuff that rose obligingly 
from the table top. 

“A real crusader,” Hulen agreed, 
with no small amount of scorn. 
“Why don’t you forget it, Cuz?” 
Bruno maneuvered the yellow 
ring into a horizontal position, sta- 
bilizing it several feet above the 
pylon and away from the table. 
Next, he raised another projection 
from the flat surface and fash- 
ioned a smaller, light green circle. 

“Trying to communicate with 
them might still be a good idea,” 
he offered, keeping the talk alive 
so they wouldn’t notice what he 
was doing. 

“I said forget it!” Hulen snapped. 
Bruno sent the smaller ring 
floating up toward the larger one. 
“If this building we’re on is their 
center of government, we could 
make an impressive show out of 
tt. We could get together a whole 
bunch of people and march—” 
“Four’s the limit,” Sal reminded 
jevenly, as though she might pre-

fer that it weren’t and that Bruno 
could go ahead with his plan. 

VV^ITH the smaller ring beside 
” the larger one, he paused, ab- 
ruptly apprehensive over the re- 
sults the experiment might pro- 
duce. He glanced at the others. 
None of them was aware that he 
was up to anything. 

“We could break the rule of 
four for something as important as 
contacting the Spheres,” he said, 
to divert their attention. 

Hulen’s teeth showed in a look 
of exasperation. A blunt hand of 
force stuff reached out from the 
surface of the table, seized Bruno’s 
robe and jerked him roughly for- 
ward. 

“Didn’t I already tell you,” Hul- 
en shouted, “that thousands of peo- 
ple have tried all the schemes — 
for hundreds of years?” 

And a dozen tiny mouths had 
formed on the surface of the table, 
each pair of blue lips soundlessly 
echoing the rebuke. 

Lea folded her arms disgustedly. 
“Man, is he ever a creep!” 

“I wouldn’t say that exactly,” 
Sal retorted. 

“Go ahead, side with him!” Lea 
shot back. “I guess you still got 
a lot of hayseed to shake out of 
your hair too!” 

Hulen rose to assume the role 
of conciliator, and the hand of 
force substance that had gripped 
Bruno’s robe sank back into the

table. “Look, kids, this is no way 
to enjoy a night out.” 

Exempt from the conversation 
for the moment, Bruno returned 
his attention to the rings of frozen 
energy. Once more he moved the 
smaller toward the larger. 

Lea stood there arrogantly, her 
hands thrust on her hips, as she 
glowered at Hulen. “I don’t ex- 
pect to enjoy a night on the City 
with this drip! What’s he trying 
to do, anyway?” 

“Whatever it is,” Sal said, “at 
least he thinks it’s right.” 

“Yeah. And you probably do 
too.” 

“What if I do?” Sal returned de- 
fiantly. 

“Well, you can have the lunk- 
head! We got the best deal any- 
body ever had. And he wants to 
yank it out from under us!” 

Just then Bruno finally got the 
small green ring centered directly 
above the large yellow one. He 
lowered it carefully into place, 
until the x one was perfectly en- 
closed within the other. 

There was a great’flare of crim- 
son brilliance as billows of pure 
energy began spilling from the 
mouth of the double halo. 

Lea and Sal screamed and 
sprang aside, riding a crest of blue 
pylon material to the far edge of 
the truncated surface. Hulen 
lunged up, seized Bruno’s arm 
and dragged him to safety. 

“It’s all right,” Bruno assured 



r 

them. “I did it. I made the rings! 
and—” 

Hulen and Lea were gawking at 
him as though he were crazy. 

“You did it?” Lea asked, her 
voice skeptical and vehement. 

“Experimenting again, eh?” Hul- 
en said. 

Bruno separated the rings and 
the cataract was snipped off. 

“That settles it!” said Lea. “I’m 
going home. Hulen, either you’re 
going to see that I get there safe- 
ly or you’re going to stay here 
with — with that!” 

Scores of slender fingers sprang 
up from the blue pylon substance 
to point incriminatingly at Bruno. 
Then Lea cast herself over the 
edge of the mesa and went skid- 
ding down the incline. 

Hulen caught his robe up be- 
tween his legs and leaped over 
after her. “See you later,” he threw 
back. “Keep him out of trouble, 
Sal.” 

Bruno watched the pair slide 
down the slope. As they neared 
the bottom, a ripple of force stuff 
built up before them and grew 
into a restraining wave that 
checked their speed.

S AL walked to the edge and 
stood gazing thoughtfully out 
over the City. “Why did you have 
to spoil everything and start ex-j 
perimenting with that red stuff?’]

she asked him reproachfully. 

Reminded of the pair of rings, 
he glanced back and, with a brief 
volition, sent them hurtling away 
— over the city, past the outer 
wall of force, through the dismal 
night air above the plain. He 
watched the faint, luminous specks 
disappear over the horizon. 

“I thought you were with me, 
Sal. I got the impression you 
wanted to see me contact the 
Spheres, that maybe you’d like to 
find out how this force stuff works.” 
“But don’t you see that’s not the 
point?” She turned abruptly to- 
ward him. “The fact is that the 
Spheres can’t be contacted.” 

He pretended to concede the 
argument. “All right. But why not 
find out all we can about this force 
stuff?” 

She raised her knuckles 
troubledly to her lips. “I don’t 
know. I’m confused. Maybe we 
ought to be satisfied with what we 
have and not expect more out of 
a perfect setup.” 

“But things aren’t perfect,” he 
pointed out. “Not as long as peo- 
ple like you and me are looked 
on as pests. Not as long as there 
are Hulens and Leas who are 
satisfied with that role.” 

She hid her uncertainty in si- 
lence. 

“That red energy is interesting,” 
he said, thinking aloud. “All it 
takes to get as much of it as you 
want is a pair of rings — rings that 



can be formed from any of the 
force substance.” 

“But why would anyone want 
that deadly stuff?” 

“Because it’s obviously the basic 
force material of the City. From 
it come all the other kinds of 
energy matter.” 

Sal was showing a more direct 
interest now. “But where does it 
come from?” 

“Everard said the Spheres prob- 
ably came from another universe. 
Maybe the red force stuff is what 
separates our universe from theirs 
— a sort of sandwiched-in layer. 
And when you put the two rings 
together, it opens a door for the 
energy to gush through.” 

“What do the two rings have 
to do with it?” 

He laughed. “How would I 
know? But the important thing is 
that we don’t have to know! Sup- 
pose a super-intelligent mouse 
learns he can produce fire by rub- 
bing two sticks together? He could 
do it without knowing why, couldn’t 
he?” 

A N alarm sounded in the depths 
of Bruno’s consciousness. 
Then he noticed the pale blue cast 
suffusing the girl’s features had 
taken on a subtle yellow tinge. 
Instinctively, he flung her to the 
floor and hurled himself down be- 
side her. And the pylon sprouted a 
pair of solicitous arms that reared 
up to grasp them protectively, like 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



39 



a mother clutching her children to 
her bosom. 

The bolt of destructive energy 
crackled inches over their heads 
and spent itself in the empty night 
air. 

They both then saw the Sphere 
that had emerged through an 
opening in the structure. Its yellow 
surface clouded over with a faint 
purple-white hue as it generated 
energy for another blast. 

Bruno shoved the girl over the 
brink and leaped after her. They 
went tumbling down the incline 
together. Near the bottom, he 
gradually piled up a wave of force 
stuff in front of them to slow their 
descent. He enlarged the obstruc- 
tion and brought them to a com- 
plete stop just as they reached the 
surface. 

“You all right?” he asked. 

She rose unevenly. Three props 
reared up out of the energy ma- 
terial to steady her. 

“Nothing broken.” She smiled 
shakingly. “Say, you are learning! 
And thanks. We could have both 
been—” 

Her composure snapped and she 
was caught up in a helpless reac- 
tion to the narrow escape. She fell 
against him and sobbed with her 
face buried in his robe. 

An excessively solicitous arm of 
force stuff sprang up to offer her 
the support he was already pro- 
viding. Angrily, he slapped it away. 

“It’s horrible here, Bruno!” she 



said bitterly. “It looks soft and 
luxurious. But death can come at 
almost any instant!” * 

“I know, I know. Come, let’s get 
away from here.” 

Bruno found he had no aptitude 
for duplicating Hulen’s wave-form 
automobile. So, instead, he saw 
Sal home on a simple tobaggan- 
like contraption. It served almost 
as well, except that when they 
neared their destination, he failed 
to maintain control over the up- 
turned edge. Losing its identity as 
part of the mobile wave configura- 
tion, the forward curve had sud- 
denly swept back, swiping him 
and the girl from the pseudo-sled. 

After he watched her go into 
her mound, he turned reluctantly 
and headed back for Hulen’s place. 
Before he could take a second 
step, though, the inevitable wave 
of pink force built up behind his 
heels and began moving him ef- 
fortlessly forward. 

Without resisting, he let the un- 
dulating carpet carry him along 
while he concerned himself with a 
nagging indecision. 

Of course he intended to con- 
tact the Spheres! Wasn’t that his 
only motive for coming to the 
City? But somehow he suspected 
he might ultimately be diverted 
from his purpose. Or maybe his'j 
uncertainty was simply a reaction 
to the unreasonable and unex- 
pected opposition he was meeting. 
He, Bruno of the Spruce clan, 



40 



GALAXY 






was going to come blustering into 
\ the City and merely announce his 
i intention of setting up Man’s first 
contact with the Spheres. Thou- 
sands were going to strew rose 
petals in his path and cheer him 
on like a conquering liberator. 
Then, when it was all over, they 
were going to hoist him to their 
shoulders in a triumphant march 
back to the clean area, joyously 
proclaiming freedom from the 
the aliens. 

Nuts! He sneered at his own 
naivete — at his failure even to sus- 
pect the City dwellers might re- 
sent his interference. 

LANCING up at the glim- 
mering mounds and towering 
force structures that were limned 
brilliantly against the night sky, 
Bruno felt suddenly depressed. As 
though in response to his vague 
thoughts of fatigue and disillu- 
sionment, the wave that had been 
pushing him along washed to a 
halt and the omnipresent carpet 
rolled upward in front of him. 
Swiftly, it burgeoned into the 
shape of a reclining chair with a 
stout arm rest that bore an ornate- 
ly curved pitcher and tumbler. 

Within seconds, the surface of 
the pitcher frosted over, inviting 
attention to the icy water that was 
condensing both within and with- 
out the container. The other arm 
rest grew a slender hand that 
1 reached out and took him enticing- 

1 THE CITY OF FORCE 



ly by the elbow to draw him for- 
ward. 

He thrust the congenial hand 
aside and lashed out in a vicious 
kick. The entire complex of com- > 
fort shrank away, flowing regret- 
fully back into the amorphous pink 
carpeting. 

That was his trouble, he de- 
cided abruptly. The entire City 
must be luring him with its lux- 
uries and pleasures, captivating 
him as it had bewitched Hulen 
and Everard and Lea. 

But then, as his surge of emo- 
tional resentment abated, he real- 
ized, after all, that the City itself 
was not a living thing — that what- 
ever it did to accommodate him 
was but an impersonal manifesta- 
tion, a peculiar reaction of the 
force stuff to the pressure of either 
conscious or wishful thought. 

And if Hulen and the others had 
been captivated, it wasn’t as much 
by the City as it was by their own 
insatiable desire for the easy way. 

He was determined it wouldn’t 
happen to him. 

He started forward again and 
once more the energy layer came 
alive to form an impelling wave. 
Rejecting the offering, he stamped 
vehemently on the rippling carpet. 

And, for as far as he could see, 
the ground thrust up a thousand 
ill-shaped legs, each ending in a 
hobnailed boot that struck down 
vengefully in a sympathetic ges- 
ture of self-punishment. 



41 



Bruno, suddenly struck with the 
humor of the incident, bent back- 
ward, laughing aloud. And all the 
extended legs retracted into the 
parent mass while scores of faces, 
featureless except for full lips and 
bulging jowls, materialized in their 
places. They shared his amuse- 
ment, roaring in soundless mirth. 

Striding resolutely forward un- 
der his own power now, he turned 
sharply around the projecting wall 
of a mound and almost collided 
with a Sphere which was just 
emerging from the blue structure. 

Even before he could get set, 
the alien loosed a searing bolt 
that struck close enough to singe 
his robe. 

He lunged aside, berating him- 
self for having been caught off 
guard. As he continued maneuver- 
ing defensively, his resentment 
grew and, almost unconsciously, he 
found himself swiftly fashioning 
a yellow and green ring out of the 
force substance. 

While he escaped another dis- 
charge, he sent one circlet hurtling 
to its proper position within the 
other. When the stream of red 
energy rushed through, he mental- 
ly molded it into a lance of light- 
ninglike force and hurled it at 
the Sphere. 

The alien had been generating 
another discharge. But the impact 
of the crimson force rocked him 
visibly and the flush of yellow 
energy along his surface was dis- 



sipated in a shower of useless 
sparks. 

The Sphere lurched backward, j 
collided with the mound from 
which he had emerged, bounced off 
and went scurrying away. 

VII 

T> OLLING over on his back, 
Bruno awakened to a vague 
awareness that he was being stu- 
diously watched. He raised him- 
self on an elbow and discovered 
that the crude sleeping mound he 
had constructed the night before 
had metamorphosed into a dupli- 
cate of his four-poster back home. 
The spruce headboard was au- 
thentically colored and even its 
grain looked real. The pink force 
material on which he lay had taken 
on the soft white color of a sheet. 

Everard and Hulen stood be- 
side the bed, looking soberly down 
at him. 

The old man ran a stiff, specu- 
lative finger over his chin. “Hulen 
says you’re still thinking about 
messing around chummylike with 
the Blubber Balls.” 

Actually, Bruno was still uncer- 
tain whether he should go through 
with his intention of contacting the 
Spheres. Would the aliens recog- 
nize human intelligence and with- 
draw, leaving the people free to i 
develop their iwn world as they j 
had once befc ;? Would there be i 
cooperation a 1 help from the 

GALAXY ' 



42 



Spheres? Or would the result be 
something awful — something he 
hadn’t even considered? But the 
men’s attitude decided him. 

He threw his legs over the side 
of the bed and sat up. “I think 
I’ll give it another try. Maybe 
this round I’ll pick the right place 
and time.” 

Two servile arms of the floor 
groped for his sandals, found them 
and slipped them on his feet. Hul- 
en and Everard watched the inter- 
lude with impatient misgiving. 

“You’re not going to communi- 
cate with the Spheres,” Hulen said 
finally, his words heavy with deter- 
mination. 

“What the hell, son!” Everard 
exclaimed. “You want to bring 
on another extermination?” 

“You ever been in on one of 
them?” Hulen persisted. “Women 
grabbing up kids and running for 
their lives. Old folks like Everard 
here scurrying for safety and not 
making it. Everybody pouring out 
of the City.” 

Bruno rose and one of the bed- 
posts extended a hand that began 
smoothing his robe about him. “We 
might find the Spheres willing to 
help. Once they learn—” 

“Like hell!” Hulen shot back. 

, “The only thing they’re interested 
in about us is stamping us out!” 

“They might change their mind 
if they knew we weren’t just dumb 
pests. Anyway, for every one of 
us taking it easy in the City, there 



are thousands having a rough time 
in the forests. Why should we be 
entitled to the easy life?” 

Hulen drew indignantly erect. 
“Because we are willing to take 
our chances with the Spheres and 
the force stuff!” 

“That may be so, but the main 
point is that things are tough in 
the clan areas because the Spheres 
own the world. And I don’t think 
the Spheres even realize we’re at 
all put out. So I figure we might 
as well try to get through to them. 
What can we lose?” 

Everard shook his head dis- 
traughtly. “What can we lose? By 
agitating ’em, you’ll make ’em 
aware of our presence. Then 
there’ll be an extermination. Plen- 
ty of us’ll get killed — we ain’t 
had that kind of big-scale work- 
out in years. And it’ll be months 
before those who are left can get 
back in the City.” 

TTULEN placed a patronizing 
hand on his cousin Bruno’s 
shoulder. “We got unwritten laws, 
Cuz. They say don’t do anything 
to advertise our presence; keep 
under cover; if you gotta go out 
of your hole, don’t congregate; 
don’t go in the open any oftener 
than you have to.” 

Uncertainly, Bruno looked 
down at his palms. Another pair 
of hands shot up from the floor 
to present themselves eagerly for 
his inspection. 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



43 



“Changed your mind?” Everard 
asked anxiously. 

If he had, it wouldn’t have been 
as a result of their arguments. Any- 
way, the goal of contacting the 
Spheres had been with him for 
as long as he could remember. 

Still waiting for an answer, Hul- 
en said, “We don’t have any courts 
here, but the boys have their own 
brand of kangaroo justice. How 
about it?” 

“No.” 

Everard and Hulen exchanged 
grim looks. 

“We watched you last night,” 
Hulen said. “Know something? 
You’re developing a rare sort of 
control over this force stuff. Take 
this bed here, for instance—” 

“It’s a form of subconscious con- 
trol,” Everard added. “Pretty 
damned dangerous.” 

“How so?” 

“Why, your emotions can run 
away with you when you get ex- 
cited. You might make the energy 
material do things to hurt others.” 

“Fifteen, twenty years ago, we 
had another fellow with the same 
kind of control,” Hulen offered. 
“He ended up killing without even 
knowing it. His subconscious ran 
away with him. They found two 
guys strangled by hands of force 
stuff.” 

Everard winced reminiscently. 
“Even before that, he gave us hell 
with his nightmares. The monsters 
he dreamed up became real — 



force stuff, sure, but you shoulda 
seen ’em!” 

“What are you getting at?” 

“We had a meeting last night- 
after we watched you put on that 
show outside the girls’ mound,” 
Hulen explained. “We decided it 
would be too dangerous for you 
to stay on in the City.” 

“And,” Everard concluded, “the 
boys said to tell you that you got 
till tonight to get out.” 

A S far as Bruno was concerned, 
that practically settled it. He 
was just obstinate enough to react 
the wrong way to their threats. 
And if the great pylon they had 
visited the night before was the 
City’s seat of government, he 
would have plenty of time, before 
the day was over, to attempt an- 
other contact. 

The determined manner in 
which he went gliding through the 
wall of the mound must have left 
Hulen and Everard with no doubt 
as to his purpose. 

Fortified by the brightness of 
a warm summer’s sun overhead, 
the brilliant array of force struc- 
tures cast an intense glare and 
he shaded his eyes with a hand 
as he struck out for Sal’s quar- 
ters. But when he rounded the 
next mound, he saw the girl glid- 
ing anxiously in his direction. 

“Bruno!” She reached him and 
caught his arm. “They had a meet- 
ing last night and—” 1 



44 



GALAXY 



“Yes, I know. They decided to 
run me out of town.” 

“That’s not all. A delegation 
from the other side of town at- 
tended. On the way home, the 
whole bunch of them were seen by 
a group of Spheres!” 

He glanced at the broiling sun 
and wiped a film of perspiration 
from his forehead. “I suppose that 
means—” 

But Sal drew in a dismayed 
breath and backed away, staring 
apprehensively over his shoulder. 
At the same time, he was conscious 
of a dark shadow moving over 
them. He whirled around. 

The thing that had seized her 
attention was a tree. Rising out 
of the omnipresent pink carpet, it 
grew swiftly, expanding its trunk, 
sending out a branch here, a twig 
there, covering itself with a lux- 
uriant dome of green foliage. Then 
he recognized it. It was a replica 
of the shade tree behind his house. 

“It’s all right,” he said, turning 
back toward Sal. 

The shadow of the tree brought 
a delightful coolness. Its branches 
swayed gently, sending down soft 
currents of refreshing air. 

She dismissed the phenomenon 
with a shrug. “About those men 
; being seen by the Spheres— every- 
I body’s afraid there’ll be an exter- 
I mination! Some of the people on 
j the South Side are already pack- 
ing up and heading toward the 
plain.” 



“They figure it’s going to be that 
bad?” 

She nodded. “Maybe we ought 
to get out too, Bruno.” 

He ran a hand uncertainly 
through his hair. It seemed that 
everything was lining up against 
him, trying to keep him from com- 
municating with the aliens. 

TTE dropped to the lumpy, pink 
surface. But even as he seated 
himself and drew his knees up re- 
flectively under his chin, the force 
stuff smoothed out and sprouted 
a neatly clipped carpet of artifi- 
cial grass. 

“Are you still going to try to 
contact the Spheres?” she asked, 
down on her knees beside him. 

“I want to. I think it’s the right 
thing to do. But I’m afraid of what 
might happen. I don’t know what 
to expect — how the Spheres will 
react.” 

“Well, they’ll realize we’re 
worthy of their help and respect, 
won’t they?” she asked hopefully. 

He didn’t answer. Instead, he 
absently watched all the energy 
structures around him send glisten- 
ing streamers toward the sun to 
collect droplets of food stuff from 
its rays. Then, as he remembered 
that he hadn’t had breakfast yet, 
thin ribbons of silver also began 
growing out of the foliage of the 
tree. The food energy that con- 
densed on them rolled into clus- 
ters and drifted through the 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



45 



leaves to attach themselves to the 
lowest branches, hanging there like 
golden grapes. He picked a clus- 
ter for himself and handed one 
to the girl. 

“They’ve got to accept us!” he 
said. “I don’t see how they could 
react any other way. But the 
others have made me doubt my 
own judgment.” 

“You’ve planned on contacting 
them for a long time, haven’t 
you?” 

“All my life. It’s been like a 
goal.” 

She grasped his arm. “Maybe 
it’s not so important anyway. May- 
be you’re seeing it all out of pro- 
portion.” 

“But doesn’t the world belong 
to us?” he protested. 

“I don’t mean that. I mean 
about feeling you had to contact 
the aliens. Don’t you see that’s a 
dream everybody has, to a degree? 
It’s like wanting to hunt treasure 
on a desert island, or become chief 
of the superclan, or — like they 
used to say before the Spheres — 
make a million dollars. Maybe it’s 
nothing more than an idle child- 
hood fancy that you’ve viewed 
out of proportion. But even if you 
don’t contact the Spheres, you’ve 
been luckier than most. You’ve 
come to the City. You’ve had a 
chance at your goal.” 

“Sal—” He placed a hand over 
hers, not quite sure what he wanted 
to say. “Would you go back to the 



Spruce clan with me — now?” 

She fixed her eyes on an irides- 
cent spire and said, “Yes, if you 
want me to.” 

He glanced at her hair, gold 
like the color of a food ball filled 
with energy and sustenance from 
the sun, and at her eyes, more 
deeply blue than the most vivid 
mound in the radiant City. 

“Thanks,” he said, rising reso- 
lutely. “That’s what I want too. 
But I’m going through with what 
I came here for.” 

VIII 

A BRANCH of the tree, absorb- 
ing its foliage to develop a 
hand, reached down and tugged 
urgently on his robe. Another 
grew a half-balled fist with a long, 
curving finger that tapped him in- 
sistently on the shoulder and 
pointed behind him. Only then 
did he realize that what he had 
mistaken for the sibilant swish of 
leaves over the past few seconds 
had actually been whispered 
voices. 

He whirled around. On the other 
side of the tree Hulen, Everard 
and a score other robed figures 
were advancing furtively. Know- 
ing they had been discovered, the 
crowd of men drew erect with de- 
termination. 

“Don’t try to pull anything fan- 
cy with the force stuff,” Everard 
warned gruffly. 



46 



GALAXY 



^ Hulen gestured with a fist. “We 
\ brought along enough help to over- 
ride your control, no matter how 
good you are.” 

Several hostile arms of force 
material sprang up all around 
Bruno and jockeyed for vantage 
points. He gave Sal a shove and 
sent her coasting away on a hastily 
devised sled. The tree, which he 
had been maintaining with a prac- 
tically subliminal intent, collapsed 
and was quickly reabsorbed by 
the radiant carpet. 

“So you’re going to go through 
with it anyway?” Everard laughed 
challengingly. 

“Look, Cuz,” Hulen said. “You 
already got us in enough trouble, 
but maybe it ain’t too late. How 
about clearing out without rais- 
ing any more stink?” 

“You said I had till tonight.” 

‘We changed our minds. Out 
you go now!” 

One of the arms of force darted 
forward, seized his robe and spun 
him around. Another changed in- 
stantly into a booted foot and 
aimed a kick that only grazed his 
thigh. 

Bruno sent the pink stuff bil- 
lowing up in a great wave which 
swept down on the others. But a 
second enormous swell formed in 
i front of the first and met it in 
j a head-on clash that shot a gey- 
ser of radiance skyward along the 
entire front. 

The nearest menacing arm de- 



veloped a gigantic hand which 
thrust forward and caught Bruno 
in its grip, pinning his elbows to 
his side. Before the breath could 
be squeezed out of him, though, 
he went on the defensive — half 
a dozen smaller arms material- 
ized beside him to grapple with 
the attacking hand, prying it loose 
and forcing it back down into the 
parent mass. 

But the force carpet convulsed 
suddenly beneath him and he lost 
his balance, falling over forward. 
With the speed of striking snakes, 
tendril after tendril lashed out of 
the sea of pink substance, ensnar- 
ing his arms and fastening him 
against the surface. 

A gigantic fist came crashing 
against his temple and drew back 
for another blow. He shook his 
head to clear it, glanced at the 
others. They were still compactly 
assembled, faces tense with the 
mental effort behind their assault. 

’ 1 1 HEN he noticed the halo of 
green force material hovering 
several feet above them. It wasn’t 
until he watched the yellow cir- 
clet rise like a smoke ring from 
the surface, however, that he real- 
ized his own unconscious direc- 
tion was behind the preparation to 
send a stream of deadly red energy 
pouring down on his attackers. 

He halted the meeting of the 
rings. Hulen and Everard were, 
after all, only following their con- 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



47 



victions. And even though they 
were fanatically resisting the threat 
to their easy life, they weren’t out 
to kill him. 

He summoned the rings for- 
ward to a point halfway between 
himself and the others. Then he 
moved one decisively within the 
other. The coruscating flow of 
crimson energy gushed forth, cas- 
cading down to the surface. 

There was instant defeat in the 
terrified expressions of the others 
as they retreated before the cata- 
ract. Everard bolted first, scurry- 
ing for the closest mound. 

The tendrils that had held 
Bruno captive relaxed their grip 
and slipped off. And, all around 
him, the other threatening pro- 
jections of force stuff melted away 
as Hulen and the rest of the group 
followed Everard in full flight. 

Bruno swiftly regained his feet 
and, with a casual hand gesture, 
separated the rings. The energy 
flow ceased and he turned to look 
for Sal. 

But suddenly she went streak- 
ing past, frenziedly gliding away 
on an erratic wave of propelling 
force. She was headed for the 
same mound into which the others 
had disappeared. 

Even before he turned to see 
what had frightened the girl, he 
knew what he would find there. 

The huge Sphere, faint ripples 
of quiescent energy coursing lan- 
guidly across its surface, con- 



fronted him. It was as thought 
somewhere deep within the alien 
form there was a pair of hidden 
eyes that held him in a speculative 
stare. 

But there was no violent dis- 
play of coalescing energy across 
the thing’s surface. And it wasn’t 
advancing. Instead, it drifted slow- 
ly — curiously? — over to the pair 
of rings Bruno had molded. 

The impulse to follow the others 
in flight abated and was quickly 
replaced by the triumphant aware- 
ness that here, at last, was the op- 
portunity to reach his goal. Here, 
finally, was a Sphere whose first 
reaction to the presence of a hu- 
man wasn’t a vengeful, impulsive 
lance of lethal energy — a Sphere 
whose inquisitiveness invited trial 
of Bruno’s plan to contact the 
aliens. 

He felt both humble and proud 
as he realized that within his reach 
was the goal of a lifetime — that 
now he might accomplish the pur- 
pose which had drawn him through 
miles of forest and across stretches 
of plain to the City of Force. 

And when he returned to his 
clan, he might well be bringing the 
news that the period of Man’s 
humiliation upon his own world 
was at an end. 

The Sphere drew up before 
Bruno’s hovering rings and re- 
mained motionless for perhaps two 
minutes. Then, obviously in com- 
pliance with the alien’s direction, 



48 



GALAXY 



i the circlets came together sudden- 
"■ ly and released a spurt of fiery 
energy. They separated again and 
drifted to a new position near 
Bruno. 

A LTHOUGH there were no 
discernible features on the 
Sphere’s surface, Brnno imagined 
the creature had turned to “face” 
him expectantly and observe what 
he, in turn, would do with the pair 
of force objects. 

He ordered one halo inside the 
other, producing another brief 
gusher of crimson force. 

The alien conjured up two new 
rings from the glimmering mate- 
rial of the surface and used them 
to create a waterfall of radiant 
energy. 

Bruno duplicated the feat with- 
out hesitation. 

And, as the Sphere drifted ani- 
matedly around in an expression 
of excitement, Bruno was even 
more exultant in the conviction 
that at last his efforts were meet- 
ing with full success. Now he 
could almost sense the sudden re- 
spect the alien creature must feel 
toward him. He drew haughtily 
erect with newfound self-assurance 
and dignity. 

But wait — there was more! 

As the Sphere towered over 
him, he was aware of a curious 
sensation at the back of his eyes. 
Or maybe it was deep within his 
inner ears. The vague “feeling,” 



however, wasn’t restricted to his 
sight and hearing. It was some- 
thing he could even taste and 
smell. 

Frightened by the incomprehen- 
sible assault on all his senses at 
the same time, he gave ground. 
But a calm sensation of satisfac- 
tion and reassurance swept over 
him and he was at once certain 
there was no immediate danger. 

He closed his eyes and his per- 
ception of things that had no ap- 
parent existence became stronger, 
more vivid. It was as though he 
could still “see” the Sphere and as 
though the alien had extended a 
gossamer web of light and sound, 
feeling, taste and smell toward him. 

In his hyperphysical perception, 
Bruno eagerly watched himself 
put forth a similar bridge of com- 
municative thought toward the 
Sphere - a web that might have 
been woven of imperceptible force 
threads. 

There was an abrupt meeting 
of the two projections and instant- 
ly Bruno’s mind seemed to be 
caught up in a vortex of ideas and 
symbols — words that weren’t 
words at all but more like fierce, 
raw units of basic meaning, stripped 
of all linguistic character. 

It was as if he were encounter- 
ing the symbols for the first time 
and indelibly learning their mean- 
ing simultaneously. 

If he had been called upon to 
translate the impressions, the 



THE CITY OF FORCE 



49 



closest he could have come to 
transposing them into language 
would have been: “What the hell, 
little vermin! What gives?” 

13 UT there was no threat behind 
the communication, only 
amused excitement and intense 
curiosity. 

Bruno pressed his success and 
quickly sent back picture images 
of men — proud men — and the 
knowledge at their disposal. In one 
great outburst of emotion, he pre- 
sented the case of humanity sur- 
rounded by its once-huge cities 
and vast and intricate machines, 
of Man the thinker, dealing in ab- 
stract thought, of Man the ex- 
perimenter, traveling in his land, 
air and underwater contraptions. 

He conjured up idea pictures 
of people in their compact and ef- 
ficient settlements, and he even 
threw in the concept of destructive 
and annoying insects and rodents 
and small winged creatures that 
always followed humans wherever 
they went. 

These, he proposed with great 
dignity, were the pests — the real 
pests. Not Man himself. - 

In his next series of picture sym- 
bols, he likened humanity to the 
Spheres and offered the sugges- 
tion that there should be intellec- 
tual kinship between the two 
species. 

To demonstrate his point, he 
transmitted the formula for the 




50 



circumference of a circle, the rec- 
ipe for making corn pone, the 
number of feet in a mile, how to 
find the height of a tree by triangu- 
lation, the method of determining 
the volume of a sphere. 

Bruno felt reasonably certain 
that the last bit of knowledge he 
had offered in evidence, hitting 
close to home as it did, was bound 
to gain a special degree of respect 
from the alien. 

And he knew he was succeed- 
ing! He was convinced the Sphere 
was tremendously impressed by 
his mental qualifications, by the in- 
telligence of humanity as a whole. 
Moreover, he suspected that the 
alien must now be regretting its 
race’s arrogance and disdain over 
the centuries for the creatures they 
had regarded only as vermin nuis- 
ances. 

This last thought, too, he sent 
over the web of communication — 
in the form of a mildly chiding 
question. 

The gossamer bridge of em- 
pathy quivered with the surprised 
incredulity of the Sphere. And a 
swell of conceptual impulses 
flooded Bruno’s senses and ar- 
ranged themselves into a meaning- 
ful sequence: “Is true, ugly little 
pest?” 

Bruno began a discourse on the 
cultural achievements of mankind. 

But the alien cut him short with 
another avalanche of picture im- 
ages and symbols that somehow 



managed to seem like words: “Col- 
lector ring trick — each pest can 
tap all-powerful force?” 

Bruno responded with a con- 
vincing surge of affirmation. No 
sense in letting the Sphere find 
out the others were too content 
with their roles as parasites even 
to think of experimenting with 
the force substance. 

“Do it again, the collector ring 
feat,” the Sphere urged against a 
background of persistent skepti- 
cism. 

Breaking contact with the crea- 
ture, Bruno directed the formation 
of another pair of halos from the 
sparkling carpet. He tinted them 
yellow and green and willed their 
mid-air meeting. He let the crim- 
son force pour through momen- 
tarily, then separated the circlets. 

“Is enough,” the alien conceded, 
beginning to move about excitedly 
once more. 

IX 

T I ^HERE was an abrupt, thun- 
derous surge of thought from 
the Sphere. Only this time it 
wasn’t directed at Bruno. Rather, 
it seemed to spread out over the 
immediate area and toward the 
center of the City. He recognized; 
the purpose behind this flow of; 
pure meaning that required noj 
medium of language for trans-/ 
mission. It was an anxious sum- 1 
moning of other nearby aliens, of'. 



those of authority who were else- 
where in the City. 

And the response was almost in- 
stantaneous. Spheres came drifting 
out of their mounds, discharging 
paraphysical emanations of curi- 
osity and surprise. 

Bruno glanced back at the struc- 
in which Sal and the others were 
hiding. Most of them were now 
staring puzzledly out at him and 
the aliens. They couldn’t know 
what was going on, but it wouldn’t 
be long before they would find out. 

There were more than a score 
of Spheres collected around him 
and the other alien now, all direct- 
ing eager questions at the latter. 
And as Bruno acquired more ex- 
perience with direct psychic com- 
munication, it was even easier for 
him to understand the exchange 
of meaning among the creatures. 

He gathered eventually from 
their conversation that the alien 
with which he had established con- 
tact was 3.14. gM. 

A huge tube of green radiance 
came hurtling over the nearby 
force structures and arched down 
to the surface. Two Spheres zipped 
down the shaft and drifted out its 
end. They hurried over to 3.14. 
gM. 



Bruno only stood there, waiting 
patiently. The next move,, after 
alll, was up to them. 

i “Is this the super-pest?” one of 
the newcomers asked skeptically, 
the direct flow of meaning seeming 



to come through to Bruno not 
quite as crudely as before. 

“This is the one, Excellency,” 
3.14. gM replied respectfully. “You 
will observe it is not scurrying 
away.” 

“You probably tried to stomp it 
and only scored a near miss.” 

“Oh, no, Excellency! It con- 
verses rationally. It knows how to 
manipulate the collector rings.” 

Evidently they weren’t aware 
that, by virtue of the psychic 
bridge 3.14. gM had helped him 
construct, Bruno was attuned to 
their exchange. Or, if they were, 
they were ignoring it. 

“Are you sure you haven’t taken 
on too much of a charge?” asked 
the other tube-traveling Sphere. 

“Of course not, Eminence. Test 
it for yourself and you’ll see.” 

Bruno shifted uneasily before 
the creatures, realizing only now 
the compromising position he was 
in. If anything should go wrong, 
he was virtually hemmed in by 
an entire assembly of Spheres. But, 
of course, nothing could go wrong. 

Still, Excellency and Eminence 
were emitting disconcerting em- 
anations, as were all the other 
aliens in the circle. Nor was there 
anything markedly friendly about 
their paraphysical background 
hum. 

“We shall see that it’s properly 
tested,” Excellency promised dis- 
dainfully. “But first, just in case it 
should check out as intelligent, 



HE CITY OF FORCE 



53 



we’ll prepare an immediate exter- 
mination and nip this thing before 
it starts.” 

DRUNO rocked back incredu- 
lously. Extermination! What 
did the Sphere mean by that? 

“Even if it’s not true that they’re 
growing intelligent,” Eminence 
stated, “an extermination is long 
overdue. I’m glad this happened, if 
that’s what it takes to get some 
action.” 

Eminence went streaking back 
to the green tube. 

Excellency drifted over toward 
Bruno and 3.14. gM followed 
close behind. 

“I do hope you’re wrong,” said 
Excellency, badly upset. “We’ve 
been plagued enough by these 
creatures, considering that they’re 
mere vermin. Great Energy! Think 
how awful it would be if it turned 
out that they were smart enough 
to manipulate our own basic 
forces!” 

So that was it! Horrified, Bruno 
shrank away from the pair of 
Spheres. He felt the vivid bridge 
of direct communication spread 
out from Excellency to engulf him. 
Desperately, he fought to avoid 
contact. He forced his attention 
away from the creatures surround- 
ing him, away from the City itself. 
And he dwelled, instead, on the 
simple thought of an idle stroll 
through the forest — a mental pre- 
occupation that would betray noth- 



ing of the intellectual com- 
plexity of Man. Maybe he could 
discredit 4.13. gM’s credibility. At 
least he had the caustic skepticism 
of Excellency on his side. And all 
the while he could sense the 
alien’s examining, questioning 
probe. 

After the pressure finally let up, 
Bruno gingerly extended an im- 
perceptible web of psychic percep- 
tion toward the others. 

“I see nothing intelligent in this 
creature,” Excellency told 3.14. 
gM quite angrily. 

“But that’s impossible! It has 
orderly thoughts! It can — Pest 
thing!” 3.14. gM’s attention was 
suddenly directed full on Bruno. 
“Form the rings! Collect the basic 
force! Show Excellency!” 

There was a burst of peevish 
amusement from Excellency, then 
a facetious taunt: “Yes, creature, 
form the rings and tap the energy!” 

Bruno inched away from the 
pair of Spheres and glanced hope- 
lessly around for a breach in the 
circle of aliens. A projection of 
force material rose obligingly from 
the surface and started to form a 
hand to point the way. But he 
stomped it down deliberately, de- 
termined not to betray his facility 
with the energy stuff. 

“Intelligent indeed!” said Excels 
lency scornfully, jeering at Bruno's! 
action. 

“But,” 3.14. gM began, “I tel 
you it did — ” 



54 



GALAX 



! 

“Enough! First X2.718 reports 
being attacked by one of these 
creatures. And now this!” 

“But that proves it, doesn’t it?” 
“It proves nothing! X2.718 has 
already submitted himself for 
shock rebalancing. After this dem- 
onstration of hysteria, I suggest 
you do the same.” 

The concept translated as “sug- 
gest,” but actually was much more 
severe. Bruno was aware of the in- 
tense emanation of confused fear 
that poured from 3.14. gM. The 
Sphere lunged backward, bolted 
through the circle of aliens and 
lumbered off between two mounds. 
“After him!” Excellency ordered. 
Bruno barely escaped being 
trampled in the rush of alien forms 
past him. He conjured up an im- 
mense wave of propelling force 
and let himself be washed off 
toward the mound where Sal was 
hiding. 

Grim-faced, Hulen and Everard 
came out to meet him. 

f <?P' X-TERM-E-NASHUN!” 
The frenzied cry came from 
the direction of the next mound. 

The wave form dissipated be- 
neath Bruno, lowering him back to 
the surface, as he turned his atten- 
tion to the new distraction. Sal and 
the others came out of the mound 
and stared off into the distance. 

“Ex-term-e-nashun! Ex-term-e- 
nhshun!” 

I A robed figure came into sight, 

I 

(THE CITY OF FORCE 



gliding forward, occasionally losing 
control over his propelling wave, 
tripping and falling. 

“They’re coming from the 
south!” he shouted at the group. 
“Spread the warning!” 

Hulen and the others exchanged 
frightened glances, then turned and 
shot away in various directions. 

Sal glided over and seized 
Bruno’s hand. “We’ve got to get 
out of the City! They’re coming 
with the red stuff! It goes through 
everything — nothing can stop 
it!” 

People were pouring out of the 
mounds now, stumbling over them- 
selves in a frantic rush for the 
outer force walls. 

And yet Bruno resisted the girl’s 
insistent tug, his eyes focused 
sickly on infinity. 

“I was wrong, Sal,” he said. “To 
Hulen and Everard, I was nothing 
more than a pest that they had to 
put up with. Oh, they figured all 
along they might have to get 
tough to keep me from going 
through with my plan. But when 
they found out I had a special 
control over the force stuff, I was 
no longer a simple inconvenience. 
I became an intolerable nuisance.” 
“There’s no time to discuss it, 
Bruno! We’ve got to get out!” 

With her words, several de- 
cidedly feminine arms reached up 
from the radiant carpet to pull 
urgently on his robe. 

“It would be the same thing if 

55 



we contacted the Spheres and 
proved we’re intelligent creatures,” 
he continued soberly. “As long as 
they think we’re just dumb pests, 
they won’t mind us hanging 
around, if we don’t disturb them 
too much. But if they learn we 
have brains too, then they’d really 
go to work on us — in the City, in 
the forests, everywhere!” 

He moved forward slowly, his 
preoccupation creating a resistance 
that made it harder for Sal to 
manipulate her wave of propulsion. 

“It would be the same thing,” 
he concluded, “if we suddenly 
found out mice were many times 
more intelligent than we supposed. 
We wouldn’t greet them with open 
arms. We’d be all the more de- 
termined to stamp them out, be- 
cause we’d know that smart mice 
would be much more of a menace 
than dumb ones.” 

DRUNO glanced back at the 
line of Spheres, then turned 
and fled with the girl. He would 
have liked to stay behind for a 
while and see how they would 
react to a few really searing blasts 
of crimson energy from the double 
rings. 

But then he realized that the 
point was not to let them know 
what formidable foes the humans 
would someday make — given 
enough time to build their own 
cities of force and learn more 
about manipulating the energy. 



1 



Sal tightened her grip on his 
hand. “Those rings — they’re fol- 
lowing us, Bruno!” 

He looked back. Only a few 
feet behind and above them, the 
yellow and green circlets that had 
hovered over the heads of Hulen’s 
group came drifting along like 
trained birds. 

Bruno smiled appreciatively. It 
was as though the rings, which were 
actually reacting to his uncon- 
scious directives, were well ahead 
of him in foreseeing the need he 
would soon have for them. 

In a moment, they were through 
the glistening white outer wall. 
Their smooth glide stopped as the 
propelling wave form ran out of 
the pink radiance and came to an 
end. 

He stood briefly at the foot of 
the wall and watched the exodus 
of humans, stumbling across the 
rock-strewn plain and filtering into 
the forest. 

With an expression of patient 
sympathy, Sal gazed after them. 
“It’ll be months before they can 
get back into the City.” 

“If we can round them up,” he 
said, “I don’t think they’ll ever 
want to go back.” 

She looked puzzedly at him. 

He sent his two force rings 
drifting ahead and positioned the 
smaller within the larger. As the 
cataract of raw red energy poured 
forth, he changed it into pink ra- 
diance. Then he sent the rinffis 



56

floating toward the forest, letting 
them lay down a narrow carpet 
of pastel stardust. 

The bulky proportions of a river 
barge took shape before them, 
centered on the glistening strip, 
and several courtly hands stretched 
out to help him and the girl aboard. 

Smoothly, the craft moved off, 
maintaining a distance of several 
feet behind the radiant waterfall 



that provided the substance for its 
form. 

As they drifted along, the river 
of light dissipated into nothingness 
behind them, leaving once again 
only the bare plain. 

And, in their wake, scores of 
hands reared above the surface of 
the pseudo-stream to wave fare- 
well.

FORECAST 

Putting the next issue together is an exciting guessing game, and as 
you can probably sense in this one, we're having fun with it. We intend to 
go right on seeing how many different combinations can be found. In this 
issue, for instance, are one novella and two novelets that are regulation 
length; they'd have fitted fine, no trouble at all, into the old Galaxy. But the 
five short stories, without a skinny little vignette or squib with a title among 
them? And the expanded editorial? Not a chance! They'd have exploded 
the works! 

Well, let's start the next issue with another challenge: 

There's a big — but big — novella on hand by Frederik Pohl that 
would have jammed all else against the walls like a circus giant in a subway 
train at rush hour. Too huge to be a novella, not long enough to be a serial, 
it frustratingly stood around in Pohl's workshop with absolutely no place to 
go. Instead of asking you to be surprised how many stories are not being 
written because they can't be housed in any ordinary magazine, we'd rather 
have you rejoice with us that now we can invite the authors to go right ahead 
and write them. 

Pohl's burly — novella? Short novel? We'll call it novella, but you know 
what we mean. In his novella, there are the most sinister aliens you've ever 
met, sinister not because they are hostile, but because they are not! They 
merely have to know all about us — whatever makes us go, whatever makes 
us stop, but particularly — WHATEVER COUNTS. 

And with that towering, powerful Pohl story to build an issue around, 
the supporting cast of stories and features can't, we assure you, be anything 
but interesting!

security plan 

By JOSEPH FARRELL 

I had something better than 
investing for the future . 
the future investing in me! 



Illustrated by WOOD 



wi JW Y mother warned me,” 
I Marilyn said again, 
X T B “to think twice before 
I married a child prodigy. Look 
for somebody good and solid, she 
said, like Dad — somebody who 
will put something away for your 
old age.” 

I tapped a transistor, put a 
screwdriver across a pair of wires 
and watched the spark. Marilyn 
was just talking to pass the time. 
She really loves me and doesn’t 

58 



mind too much that I spend my 
spare time and money building a 
time machine. Sometimes she even 
believes that it might work. 

She kept talking. “I’ve been 
thinking — we’re past thirty now 
and what do we have? A lease on 
a restaurant where nobody eats, 
and a time machine that doesn’t 
work.” She sighed. “And a draw- 
erful of pawn tickets we’ll never 
be able to redeem. My silver, my 
camera, my typewriter ...” 




I added a growl to her sigh. “My 
microscope, my other equip- 
ment . 

“Uncle Johnson will have them 
for his old age,” she said sadly. 
“And we’ll be lucky if we have 
anything.” 

I felt a pang of resentment. 
Uncle Johnson! It seemed that 
every time I acquired something, 
Uncle Johnson soon came into pos- 
session of it. We’d been kids to- 
gether, although he was quite a 
few years older, a hulking lout in 
the sixth grade while I was in the 
first, and I graduated from gram- 
mar school a term ahead of him. 
Of course I went on to high school 
and had a college degree at fif- 
teen, being a prodigy. Johnson 
went to work in his uncle’s pawn 
shop, sweeping the floor and so 
on, and that’s when we started 
calling him Uncle. 

This wasn’t much of a job be- 
cause Johnson’s uncle got him to 
work for almost nothing by prom- 
ising he would leave him the pawn 
shop when he died. And it didn’t 
look as if much would come of 
this, because the uncle was not 
very old and he was always tell- 
ing people a man couldn’t afford 
to die these days, what with the 
prices undertakers were charging. 

|I> EFORE I had even started to 
shave, I had a dozen papers 
published in scientific journals, all 
having to do with the nature of 



time. Time travel became my am- 
bition and I was sure I saw a way 
to build a time machine. But it 
took years to work out the details, 
and nobody seemed interested in 
my work, so I had to do it all 
myself. Somehow I stopped work- 
ing long enough to get a wife, and 
we had to eat. So we ran this little 
hash house and lived in the back 
room, and at least we got our food 
wholesale. 

And Johnson’s uncle, fell down 
the cellar stairs and split his skull 
open. So Johnson became the 
owner of a thriving business after 
giving his uncle a simple funeral, 
because he knew his uncle wouldn’t 
have wanted him to waste any 
more money on that than he had 
to. 

“But we have a time machine,” 
Marilyn said fondly. “That’s some- 
thing Johnson would give us a lot 
on — if it worked.” 

“We almost have a time ma- 
chine,” I said, looking around at 
my life’s work. Our kitchen was 
the time machine, with a great 
winding of wires around it to 
create the field I had devised. The 
doors had been a problem that I 
solved by making them into 
switches, so that when they were 
closed the coils made the complete 
circuit of the room. 

“Almost,” I repeated. “After 
twenty years of work, I am through 
except for a few small items—” 

I looked at her pleadingly.

“It will run about twenty dol- 
lars. Do you think—?” 

She didn’t care much for the 
idea, but finally she slid off the 
wedding ring. 

“You’ll redeem this first thing, 
Ted? Before any of the rest of the 
stuff?” 

I promised and took off at a 
dead run. 

Johnson didn’t have to inspect 
the ring; he’d seen it before, and 
he counted out twenty dollars. 
That was the only item he’d give 
me a decent price on. He knew 
I’d be back for it. 

“How’s the time machine com- 
ing along, Ted?” He had a little 
smirk, the way some people do 
when they hear I’m building a 
time machine. “Get in touch with 
Mars yet?” 

“I have no interest in Mars,” I 
told him. “I plan to make contact 
with the future — about thirty 
years from now. And for your in- 
formation, the time machine is 
practically finished. The first test 
will be tonight.” 

He wasn’t smirking now, be- 
cause he never forgot the way I 
passed him in school and he had 
a good respect for my brain. He 
looked a little thoughtful — only 
a little, because that’s all he was 
capable of. 

“You get to the future, Ted, 
suppose you bring me a news- 
paper. I’ll make it worth your 
while. I’ve always treated you fair 



and square, Ted, now haven’t I?” 
I looked over his shelves. Too 
many of those dust-covered items 
were mine. And I didn’t have to 
be a telepath to know what he 
was thinking. 

“Maybe you’d like a paper with 
the stock market quotations, 
Uncle? From about thirty years 
from now, say?” 

The smirk was completely gone 
now. “You get something like 
that, Ted, I’ll pay you! Wouldn’t 
help you out any, because you 
have nothing to invest. Me now, 
I could buy something that will 
keep me in my old age. I’d give 
you a — hundred bucks for some- 
thing like that.” 

I laughed at him. A hundred 
dollars! Uncle always had his 
nerve. He was scowling when I 
left, still trying to figure how he 
could get in on the gravy, because 
outside of Marilyn he was the 
only person who ever thought I 
might succeed. 

1VT ARILYN cooked dinner for 
us while I was putting the 
final touches on the time machine. 

“Tonight we celebrate,” she 
said. “Steak.” 

It smelled wonderful, but the 
occasional whiff of ozone from my 
equipment was more exciting. I’d 
told Marilyn we had about an 
hour before I could make the test, 
but with my working faster than I 
had expected and her getting be- 



SECURITY PLAN

hind with the meal, she was just 
putting the steaks on the table 
when I was done with the ma- 
chine. 

“Oh, but let’s eat first, Ted!” 
she said. 

“I couldn’t eat! After so much 
work—” I stared in fascination at 
the master switch — the door. 
“This is it, Marilyn! What I’ve 
been working toward all these 
years!” 

She saw the way I felt and may- 
be she was a little excited her- 
self. 

“Go ahead, Ted,” she told me. 

I closed the door. 

There was more ozone and a 
blurring in the middle of the room. 
We stepped away from the thick- 
est of the blurring, where some- 
thing seemed to be gathering sub- 
stance. 

The something, we soon saw, 
was a man sitting in a chair sur- 
rounded by strange apparatus, 
most of which I couldn’t guess the 
purpose of. It was a very young 
man, when I could see him bet- 
ter, probably nineteen, wearing 
bright clothes in what I figured 
must be the style of 1989. 

“Man-o!” he said. “This time 
machine is low Fahrenheit, o-dad- 
dy! Right to the bottom! It’s the 
deepest!” 

I blinked. “Parlez vous Fran- 
cais?” 

Marilyn said, “I think he means 
he likes it. But who is he and 

62 



just where did he come from?” 
The gaily dressed youth got out 
of the chair and smiled at us. Each 
of his shoulders had padding the 
size of a football. His coat tapered 
from four feet wide at the shoul- 
ders to a tightly bound waist, the 
lapels from a foot at the top to 
zero. The trousers widened out to 
wide stiff hoops that ended six 
inches above his shoes. And the 
shoes! But at least they weren’t 
really alive, as I had thought at 
first. 

“How is it,” asked Marilyn, 
“that a cool cat from the future 
comes to visit us in a time ma- 
chine? I would expect a more 
scholarly type.” 

“Not so, doll-o. The angleheads 
don’t reach the real science. The 
scientist pros believe that all 
knowledge is known. They delve 
not into the sub-zero regions of 
thought. That is done by us 
amateurs.” 

H E did a short bit of synco- 
pated tap and introduced 
himself. “I am Solid Chuck Rich- 
ards, ambassador to the past, cour- 
tesy of the Friday Night Bull 
Session and Experimentation So- 
ciety.” 

“Are they all like you?” I asked. 
“No, o-daddy-man. Some are 
deep, some are high on the scale, 
but all of them reach together on 
one thing — they all feel that the 
pro-scientists have grown angular 



GALAXY 



and lost the sense of wonder. So 
we gather together on Friday 
nights to work on the off-beat side 
of science. We read your books — 
if you are Ted Langer— ?” 

I admitted it. 

He danced a rhythmic circle 
around me, staring in what was 
evidently adoration, and kept mur- 
muring, “Reach that deep man! 
Ted Langer — the father of time 
travel! O-man-o! Deep! Real 
deep!” 

“Now see here,” I finally broke 
in. “Don’t they talk English where 
you come from? And just how do 
you come to be here anyway? I 
built a time machine to travel into 
the future, and instead I get you 
telling me how deep I am. Are you 
here or am I there?” 

“You are here, o-daddy-boy, 
and I also am here. But, to explain 
this, I may have to use some 
angle talk, which is what you mean 
by English. We read your books — 
which are collectors’ items, by the 
way — and we decided you were 
way under the zero mark, espe- 
cially when we saw that the angle- 
heads wouldn’t touch any of your 
ideas. So we got together and 
made our time machine. But I 
am sad to report, doctor-o, that 
your theory was a bit less than two- 
hundred-per-cent correct. There 
were a few errors, which we found.” 

It was something of a shock to 
hear this future rock-and-roller tell 
me thefe were mistakes in my 

SECURITY PLAN 



work, and I started to argue with 
him about it. But his attention 
wasn’t on the conversation. He was 
sniffing thoughtfully, the thing he’d 
called sense of wonder shining in 
his eyes. He was looking at the 
steaks Marilyn had set on the 
table. 

“Reach that!” he said, awed. 
“Gen-you-wine solid flesh! Man-o! 
I haven’t seen a steak like that 
in all my off-beat life!” 

So naturally we invited him to 
sit down at the table and he 
didn’t have to be asked more than 
once. It seemed that food was 
pretty expensive in 1991, which 
is the year he came from, and 
what there was of it mostly came 
from factories where they shov- 
eled soy beans and yeast into a 
machine and it came out meat at 
the other end, if you didn’t make 
too much fuss about what you 
called meat. But with so much of 
the good farm land ruined by 
atomic dust, and so much more 
turned into building lots on ac- 
count of the growing population, 
it was the best they could do. 

W HEN we heard this, we 
pushed the second steak in 
front of him and he showed he 
was a growing boy by finishing 
every scrap, along with a double 
order of French frieds and half a 
dozen ears of corn on the cob. But 
he had to give up after two pieces 
of pie. 



63 



He sat back in the chair, patted 
his stomach and looked as if he 
had just won the Irish sweepstakes. 
He looked at the big refrigerator. 
When Marilyn opened it to put 
things away, his eyes almost 
popped out at the sight of the 
meat stored there. 

“Man-o!” he said. “You must be 
rich!” 

Marilyn laughed. “No, not rich 
—far from it. We operate a res- 
taurant and that’s our stock you 
see.” 

“Oh, doll-o! I should not have 
eaten so much. What do you 
charge for a meal like that?” 

“We would get three and a half 
for each order,” I said, diplomati- 
cally not mentioning all his side or- 
ders, “although we don’t get much 
carriage trade here. But don’t let 
it worry you. Nothing’s too good 
for a guest from the future.” 

“Three and a half?” He looked 
amazed. “Why, such a feed would 
bring twenty-five or thirty where 
I come from — if you could find 
it! Let me pay, o-daddy-friend, at 
least your price.” 

And he pulled out some bills. I 
started to push them back, for of 
course I wasn’t going to spoil this 
great moment in my life by ask- 
ing a traveler from the future to 
pay for a meal. 

But then I saw what he was try- 
ing to give me. 

I picked up the bills and stared. 
Marilyn’s head was over my shoul- 



der and she was staring just as 
hard. She took one out of my hand. 

“It’s not real,” she said. “There’s 
not that much money in the 
world.” 

She had the five. I had the ones. 
The five-thousand and the one- 
thousand-dollar bills, that is. I 
looked up at Solid Chuck Rich- 
ards. 

“When you said that meal would 
cost twenty-five or thirty, did you 
mean twenty-five or thirty thou- 
sand?” 

“You reach me, man. Inflation, 
you know. It’s terrible. I remem- 
ber when a gee would keep the 
beat rocking in a juke palace for 
an hour. Now you pay half a gee 
a number. It’s terrible.” 

A FTER we explained to him 
that the inflation was even 
worse than that, he decided it was 
something more than terrible. It 
seems he hadn’t paid much atten- 
tion to money in his younger .days, 
though he did recall now that when 
he was very small he’d been able 
to get a good nickel candy bar for 
twenty dollars, but he hadn’t seen 
anything smaller than a hundred 
in some time now. 

“There should be a law against 
this sort of thing,” he said indig- 
nantly. “It’s enough to turn a man 
into an anglehead, the way they 
keep pushing up the price of 
fumes. And what they charge for 
Bulgy Sanders records — ”

He picked up the bills and 
looked at them. 

“But I think maybe we can find 
a way to profit on this, daddy-boy! 
I have a deep thought— we mem- 
bers of the Friday Night Bull 
Session and Experimentation So- 
ciety will come to your restaurant 
and pay you five gees for a steak 
dinner, which is a fine price for 
you but very little for us. In that 
way, we will eat good food and 
you will gather a good bundle of 
the stuff of life.” 

There was a thudding noise at 
the window. I looked over quick. 
Somebody was hanging on outside, 
off balance, as if he had been 
standing on a ladder outside and 
had fallen against the window. 

I ran for the door, forgetting it 
was a switch. But Solid Chuck 
Richards realized it. He dived 
back into his chair and called, 
“Reach you later, o-daddy!” He 
disappeared as I pulled the door 
open. 

The sudden flash as the time 
machine stopped operating re- 
minded me about those switches 
on the door, but it was too late 
now. I ran out and around the 
side just in time to see a figure 
disappearing up the alley. Sure 
enough, there was a ladder against 
the window. 

I didn’t bother chasing the man 
very far, because, after a fast look 
at him, I had a pretty good idea 
who it was. I’d speak to him later. 

S E C U R I TY\ P LAN

lVT ARILYN and I sat around 
-L” looking at the big bills. They 
were the size of present-day cur- 
rency, and were beautifully made, 
and would have passed easily ex- 
cept for a few things. Such as that 
“Series 1988” inscribed alongside 
the signature of Irving P. Wal- 
court, Secretary of the Treasury. 
And the Treasurer of the United 
States in 1988 would be Kuru 
Hamonoto. From the State of 
Hawaii, I wondered, or—? 

“They’re no use to us at all,” 
said Marilyn. “Unless we hold 
them until 1988. I was talking 
about security for our old age. Do 
you suppose—?” 

“You forget,” I said, “that steak 
will run you twenty-five or thirty 
thousand in 1988. This is going to 
be a great disappointment to the 
members of the Friday Night Bull 
Session and Experimentation So- 
ciety, but I fear we must explain 
to Solid Chuck Richards that we 
just cannot afford to do much 
business of this type.” 

I pushed aside the money and 
began thinking about some of the 
things the youth from 1991 had 
told me. There were holes in my 
theories— a lot of holes. True, I had 
succeeded in building a time ma- 
chine, but I could never go any- 
place in it. Because time travel 
was possible only by traveling from 
one time machine to another. The 
amateurs of 1991, knowing from 
my books (I must remember to 



65 



write them) that I had built a 
time machine in 1959, were able 
to make contact. Solid Chuck 
Richards was selected by lot from 
several volunteers to try the ma- 
chine. I met the other members 
of the Society later and learned 
that and a number of other things 
from them. 

The reason Solid Chuck came 
back instead of my going forward 
made solid sense. I could see it 
now. My time machine had never 
existed in 1991. His had existed 
in 1959, or at least its parts had. 
I could overcome that problem — 
if I had the full power of the Sun 
for several minutes to work with, 
and a way to handle it. Then I 
could change things so that my 
time machine would have existed 
in the future . 

Even the verb tenses were go- 
ing wrong on me. 

These amateur experimenters, 
it seemed, were considered a bit 
on the crackpot side, taking such 
pseudo-science as mine seriously. 
Not knowing enough science to 
realize that the ideas I wrote about 
were impossible, as any profes- 
sional scientist would have, they 
followed them through. They tried 
to get in touch with me in their 
time, but I wasn’t available, which 
saved me another paradox. Sup- 
pose I had joined the Society and 
come back as a volunteer? 

But it was encouraging to know 
the reason I was going to be un- 



available in 1991. Marilyn and I 
had gone on a second honeymoon 
— on the first commercial passen- 
ger liner to Mars. 

“And so,” I told her, “you don’t 
have to worry about security in 
your old age. Tickets to Mars 
must cost a few trillion dollars. 
We won’t be poor.” 

Marilyn was still looking at the 
currency of the future. 

“We will be,” she said, “if we 
•keep selling steak for the price 
of soy-bean hamburger. By the 
way, Ted, I wonder who that was 
at the window?” 

The answer came to me then. I 
put the bills into my pocket and 
kissed her. 

“We will not have to eat soy- 
bean hamburger, o-doll. And I 
will take you to Mars for your 
second honeymoon — as soon as 
they start passenger service. I am 
going out to make a down pay- 
ment on the tickets right now.” 

TTNCLE Johnson took the glass 
^ from his eye. He looked very 
tense, like a fisherman with a prize 
catch on a very thin line. 

“It’s good,” he said, and his 
voice trembled a little. “I— suppose 
your time machine worked?” 
“Surprised, are you, Uncle?” 
“Yes, yes. But I see your situ- 
ation, Ted. You, of course, can’t af- 
ford to hold these for thirty years. 
Now — ah — I can. And Fll be 
glad to help you out by' taking

them off your hands. Naturally I 
have to hold them a long time, 
so — let’s say twenty dollars a 
thousand?” 

“Let’s not say that.” I took the 
bill from his hand. “I figure fifty 
is a fair price. There’ll be lots 
more, Uncle. And, as you say, I 
am always broke and cannot af- 
ford to put them away for my 
old age. But running the time ma- 
chine is expensive and I can’t af- 
ford to take less than fifty.” 

He looked as if he were going 
to snatch the bill right out of my 
hand, he was so eager. 

“All right, Ted, I realize there 
are expenses. Thirty-five.” 

We compromised on forty. 

“But I want a promise,” he said 
emphatically. “I’m to be the only 
one you sell these bills to!” 

“You reach me, o-uncle.” I 
handed him the bills. “You’re deep, 
man. Real deep!” 

Real deep in the hole, that is— 
he mortgaged his house and his 
regular inventory to buy up all the 
money I began taking in. Once 
we redeemed the wedding ring and 



all the other articles, I got to feel- 
ing mellow and even a bit grateful. 
He’d started me in business, so to 
speak. I couldn’t stick him with 
all those millions that would just 
about buy him a helicab ride to 
the poorhouse in 1988. 

So when Marilyn and I got just 
as deep in the black, because the 
Society members gave us some 
books on stock-market statistics, 
I started giving Uncle tips every 
now and then. Not free, of course 
— I asked for half and we settled 
on seventy-thirty. With that plus 
the ones I bought, both for now 
and the long pull, I guess we’re 
the only people living today who 
can be sure of having a second 
honeymoon on Mars, although 
Solid Chuck Richards tells me he 
hears Mars is overrated, there not 
being a juke on the whole planet, 
and even if there were you couldn’t 
jump to any decent kind of beat 
in that low gravity. 

I wouldn’t say so to Solid Chuck 
Richards, but that sounds like ab- 
solute zero to me.

BY WILLY LEY 

THE ATLANTIC 
MISSILE RANGE 

I N the fall of 1944, a commis- 
sion of U. S. Army officers, 
from the Office of the Chief 
of Ordnance and from the Chief 
of Engineers, received orders to 
look for an area which was suit- 
able for the test firing of large mis- 
siles. 

The reason why this happened 
in the fall of 1944 is simple. Dur- 
ing the middle of June of that 
year, the German V-l buzz bombs 
had been streaking across the 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



69 





Fig. 1: Sketch map of Atlantic Missile Range. Firing range goes all the v'ay to Ascension 
Island, 5,000 miles from Florida 



Channel from France to England. 
Early in September, the first V-2 
rockets followed. The missile age 
was on. The United States needed 
a missile proving ground, but no 
longer for a war that happened to 
be still going on. 

The commission studied maps, 
read annual weather summaries 
and then made a few trips. As the 
outcome of their studies and in- 
spection trips, they recommended 
an area north of El Paso, Texas. 

The Secretary of Defense ap- 
proved the choice on February 20, 
1945— the war in Europe had only 
some weeks yet to run — and the 



area became established and later 
famous as the White Sands Prov- 
ing Ground. It begins at the Texas- 
New Mexico state line to the 
north of El Paso and runs due 
north from there for 125 miles. 
Its greatest width, from Alamagor- 
do on to the north, is 41 miles. 
“An immense area for the ballis- 
tics of the future has been staked 
out,” said the editor of a New 
Mexico newspaper as soon as the 
facts could be released. 

IRST rocket to be fired from 

die new proving ground was 
a WAC-Corporal, on September

Fig. 2: First rocket fired from Cape Canaveral, 
Bumper No. 8, on July 24, 1950 

26 of the same year. It went to a 
height of 43 miles in a vertical 
shot. 

Anybody who knew some- 
thing about ballistics could calcu- 
late in his head that that meant a 
maximum range of about 85 miles 
— if the WAC-Corporal had been 
a missile and not a research rocket, 
that is. 



On April 16, 1946, the first V-2 
rocket was fired. It misbehaved 
and its flight had to be terminated 
by radio command. The next V-2 
was ready on May 10 and rose, as 
programmed, to about 70 miles, 
hitting the desert 31 miles to the 
north of the firing site. 

Counting from the date of the 
Secretary’s approval, the White 
Sands Proving Ground was one 
year, two months and three weeks 
old. And it was too small! 

The Germans had fired their 
V-2s for range, reaching between 
190 and 200 miles; the lower 
value being the operational aver- 
age, the upper value the opera- 
tional record. At White Sands, you 
could fire V-2 rockets for altitude, 
but not for range. It took a few 
months until the facts of life were 
courageously faced, but in October 
1946, another committee was es- 
tablished. It was to look for a long- 
range proving ground. 

I don’t know whether some of 
the members of the new commis- 
sion had also been members of the 
first commission, but the new com- 
mission surely could read the re- 
port made by the first and retrace 
its reasoning. The reasoning then 
had been that the missile should 
be recovered for inspection and 
study after impact. Logically, 
then, the impact area had to be a 
desert. Inhabited land was out 
and a swamp would not do. And 
naturally the impact area had to 

71 



FOR YOUR INFORM AT I 0 N 




Fig. 3: Redstone rockets ready for shipment to Cape Canaveral 



be in the continental United 
States, not some other country. 

Fortunately, we don’t have 
deserts much larger than the one 
that was picked. For longer ranges 
than 200 miles — and those Ger- 
man engineers cheerfully wrote 
equations proving a range of at 
least 600 miles with a single stage 
and any range at all with three 
stages — only the ocean would do. 
Now, of course, we do have two 
long shorelines and the firing site 
could be just about wherever it 
was convenient. Impact would 
have to be in the ocean in a sec- 
tor where ships did not normally 
sail. These two points were easy. 



But what about in between? In 
between, there should be a place, 
or places, where somebody had the 
necessary instruments to track the 
flight of the missiles. The Pacific 
coastline has hardly any nearby 
islands. In the northern portion of 
the Atlantic shore, you could, on 
a map, draw a flight path which 
first skirted Long Island for its 
whole length and continued over 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. 
But these are waters which are 
not only well traveled but virtual- 
ly congested. 

A place in the southern portion 
of the Atlantic shore remained the 
only choice. There was an island

chain that could be used, the Ba-

there was Puerto Rico. The Baha- 
mas are British, but maybe we 
could come to terms with the Brit- 
ish government. Now, supposing 
the Bahamas could be used for 
tracking stations, what should one 
pick for the launching area? 

r T , HE commission looked at a 
map of Florida. There was one 
place that jutted out into the 
ocean; on the map, it measured a 
little over 16 miles from the main- 
land. The geographical situation is 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



this: Between the mainland and 
the land farther to the east, you 
first have the Indian River. Then 
comes Merritt Island. Then the 
Banana River, and then the next 
strip of land which terminates to 
the east in a sandy cape: Cape 
Canaveral. 

The Cape is sandy. So is Mer- 
ritt Island and so is the mainland. 
Where the land is not cultivated, 
you have mostly scrubby under- 
growth, interspersed with palmet- 
tos; as soon as you cross the Indian 
River, these begin to look under- 
nourished. In short, the Cape does

not look “tropical.” The tempera- 
ture is tropical, however — at least 
in August, where it is rarely less 
than 95 degrees during the day 
with the humidity being about the 
same figure. 

It is typical of people that, when 
asked about animal life in their 
area, they mention the unpleasant 
types first. The answer I got was: 
“Well, we have coral snakes, and 
cottonmouth and plenty of rattle- 
snakes. And, of course, alligators.” 
I am sure that other things must 
live there too, but they were not 
mentioned in conversation. 

As for signs of civilized activity, 
Cape Canaveral had, for years, a 
lighthouse. The lighthouse is still 
there among the missile pads, but 
for a long time it was all by itself. 
At some time, the Navy had 
picked out a few square miles of 
land and designated it the Banana 
River Naval Air Station. 

On June 20, 1947, the commis- 
sion recommended Cape Cana- 
veral as the most logical available 
long-range missile-launching site 
and suggested the Naval Air Sta- 
tion as the headquarters area. This 
recommendation was approved 
three weeks later, and with that 
the wheels could be set in motion. 
Quite a large number of wheels 
were involved. First the area had 
to be transferred from the Navy 
to the Air Force. I’m not sure 
that this was a simple step, but it 
certainly was the simplest of all 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



the steps that had to be taken. 

The next was to start negotia- 
tions with Great Britain about the 
establishment of tracking stations 
on the Bahamas. These negotia- 
tions were actually concluded in 
February, 1949, but at that mo- 
ment they were still useless. First 
Congress had to pass legislation 
which made the long-range missile- 
proving ground possible at all. Con- 
gress, naturally, would not pass 
any legislation involving a foreign 
power if it was not certain that said 
foreign power would play along. 

Then things happened with rea- 
sonable speed. Congress passed 
the necessary legislation which 
President Truman signed on May 
11, 1949. On October 1st of the 
same year, the proving ground was 
activated. The signing of the agree- 
ment with Great Britain was, for 
reasons unknown to me, delayed 
until July 21, 1950. 

TT was high time that those sig- 
natures were put on paper — 
Cape Canaveral fired its first 
rocket only three days later! It 
was a Bumper rocket, consisting of 
a V-2 as first stage and a W AC- 
Corporal as the second stage. 
Three days later, another Bumper 
was fired. 

Well, Cape Canaveral may have 
been in legal existence and also 
activated as a military establish- 
ment 1 ; but one could not say that 
it was “ready.” Robert P. Havi-

land, who was in charge of these 
two Bumper shots, reminisced 
later that at White Sands there 
had been ten feet of concrete be- 
tween him and the missile; at the 
Cape, it was a pine board one inch 
thick! He lacked confidence in 
the strength of a pine wall. Luck- 
ily, that strength did not have to 
stand a test 

All this has changed since then. 

I remember the blockhouse 
near one of the Atlas launching 
pads. Its shape is best described 
as that of the carapace of a marine 
turtle. I don’t know its size in feet, 
yards or meters. But it is large. As 
for position, imagine that the giant 
marine turtle points to the launch- 
ing pad with its tail. Where the 
hole for the neck would be in the 
carapace is where you enter. There 
is a steel door that looks like the 
door to a bank vault. Everybody, 
no matter what secrecy may pre- 
vail in other matters, will assure 
you that the people in the block- 
house might be trapped for a while 
if a missile fell on top of it, but 
that they would be safe. 

The arrangement of the various 
launching pads follows a simple 
plan. The extreme corner of the 
Cape is reserved for the Snark 
and the Bomarc. As you look 
north (more or less) from that cor- 
ner, you have four launching pads 
for the Atlas. Beyond that are the 

Fig. 7: Thor-Able rochet taking off from 
Pad 17B 



76 



GALAXY 



launching pads for the Titan. Be- 
yond that there is room for things 
still to come. 

Look the other way (more or 
less southwest) and you first have 
the area for the Navaho. Then 
comes the launching pad for the 
Vanguard, then three pads for the 
Thor (one of them for lunar 
probes), then the Army’s launch- 
ing pads for Jupiter, Redstone and 
satellite-throwing Jupiter-C rock- 
ets, and finally the “ship’s motion 
simulator” for the Polaris rocket. 
Then comes a canal for a harbor 
which is called the turn-around 
basin. 

Farther inland are three build- 
ings I recall for personal reasons. 

Let me mention the cafeteria 
first, because my personal reason 
is so simple: it is beautifully air- 
conditioned, which, after riding 
around in 95-degree heat, is a 
major point. The second building 

I remember especially is Central 
Control, about which more later. 
And the third is officially called 
Telemetry 3. It is fairly in the 
center of the whole complex. I 
haven’t been inside, but for three 
nights in a span of five days I was 
on top of it, seeing (in that order) 
a Jupiter-C rocket, carrying Ex- 
plorer V, a Jupiter missile and a 
three-engine Atlas fired. 

I I ''O the south of the Cape area, 

you have twelve miles of civil- 
ian territory. It is full of motels, 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



called Sea Missile Motel, Van- 
guard Motel, Satellite Motel and 
Starlite Motel, all efficiently air- 
conditioned, all temporarily filled 
with service brass and missile men 
and all also inhabited by tourists 
who stare at the generals and the 
missile men. 

For reasons which are probably 
historical, the Starlite is consid- 
ered the center. Convair Astro- 
nautics has its office there. There 
is also a press room with Western 
Union in evidence — if only dur- 
ing daylight hours. (What do you 
do when they fire at night? But 
let’s not go into the problems of 
the press.) 

I derived a small amount of 
private amusement from the fact 
that the manager of the Starlite 
bears the name of Landwirth. This 
German word has two meanings; 
the one that flashed into my mind 
is its meaning of “Country Inn 
Keeper.” Country? Well, yes, you 
can say so, since it isn’t a city. 
But inn? With neon signs, hot and 
cold water, long lines of Cadillacs 
and air-conditioning? 

Just to finish up the geography: 
to the south of the civilian area 
is Patrick Air Force Base. There 
doesn’t seem to be much secret 
there. Airplane hangars, an Air 
Force Weather Station and office 
buildings. And — oh, yes, an offi- 
cers’ club with a room named 
T.G.I.F., which stands for Thank 
God It’s Friday. Unimaginative 

77 



outsiders might think it is just a 
bar. 

Having made clear, I hope, that 
Patrick Air Force Base and Cape 
Canaveral are not the same thing 
(everybody seems to make that 
mistake; I myself did before I got 
there), it remains to give Cape 
Canaveral’s official name. For 
years it was known as A.F.M.T.C. 
or Air Force Missile Test Cen- 
ter. But it is not all Air Force as 
far as the missile pads are con- 
cerned. The Navy is there and so 
is the Army. More recently the 
N.A.C.A. (National Advisory Com- 
mittee of Aeronautics) has moved 
in with a number of high-altitude 
research rockets, and when the 
new National Space Agency gets 
going, they’ll no doubt send a rep- 
resentative to see General Yates, 
asking for a corner of the Cape to 
put up their things. 

So the new official name is At- 
lantic Missile Range. 

Now we come to what is called 
“down range,” those island sta- 
tions which are the real reason 
why Cape Canaveral became the 
Atlantic Missile Range. 

The first of the down-range sta- 
tions is still in Florida, near Palm 
Beach. Its name is Jupiter Inlet. 
The first island tracking station 
is on Grand Bahama Island, 152 
miles away. The next one is on 
Eleuthera, 290 miles from the 
Cape. Then comes the one on San 
Salvador, 414 miles away. The 



next one, Mayaguana, is 544 miles 
away. Station No. 7 (Patrick is 
counted as Station No. 1) is on 
Grand Turk Island, 660 miles 
away. Station No. 8 is on a big- 
ger island, in the territory of the 
Dominican Republic. And Station 
No. 9 is on the west coast of Puer- 
to Rico. It is named Mayaguez 
Air Force Base, after a city on 
Puerto Rico which is about 30 
miles from the tracking station. 

A T first, this thousand-mile 
range from Florida to Puerto 
Rico was thought to be long 
enough. Then “down range” had 
to be extended to the tiny island 
of Santa Lucia, all of 27 miles 
long and 14 miles wide. This made 
“down range” 1400 miles long. 
The next logical checkpoint would 
have been the extreme eastern 
tip of South America. But it was 
not necessary to go to the main- 
land; there was another small 
island available which one Count 
de Noronha had discovered in 
1503. Logically, the island is 
named Fernando de Noronha. 

This one is really small, like 
the tropical isles of the story books. 
It is 5% miles long by 3 A of a 
mile wide. The Brazilian govern- 
ment maintains a military base 
there, manned by 150 soldiers. 
The non-military population is 
about 650. It is an ichthyophagous 
— all right: “fish-eating” — com- 
munity and probably not by 
GALAXY 



78 



choice. The distance from the 
Cape to Fernando de Noronha is 
3,585 miles and the island is some 
distance to one side of the missile 
flight path. This does not harm 
the tracking; after all, these mis- 
siles do not skim the surface of the 
ocean. (Having written this, I feel 
a premonition that some day some- 
body will build one that does.) 

The current last link in the 
chain, or Station No. 12, is Ascen- 
sion Island in the middle of the 
South Atlantic, about four times 
as large as Fernando de Noronha 
in area. It is 4400 miles from the 
Cape. Beyond it is mostly open 
sea, but the simple facts of physics 
are that if you shoot a rocket much 
faster than you need for this 
range, it will go into orbit. 

Now there is a 2000-mile gap 
between Puerto Rico and Fernan- 
do de Noronha, and another 800- 
mile gap between the latter and 
Ascension. To fill these gaps, there 
are sea-going tracking stations, 
trim ships full of instrumentation. 
They are of two types and their 
total number was thirteen in Sep- 
tember 1958. 

It seems hard for the outsid- 
er to grasp that all this, the area 
of the Cape with its buildings and 
equipment worth $400,000,000, its 
19,000 people and all the down- 
range stations over thousands of 
miles, should just be considered a 
laboratory. As a matter of fact, the 
term should be even more cur- 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



tailed; it is just a testing labora- 
tory. They don’t “invent” missiles 
at the Cape. They don’t even build 
missiles. All they do is test them. 
Testing means to find out (A) 
whether something goes wrong 
and (B) what did go wrong if 
something did. Since testing means 
finding out, you have the para- 
dox that what looks like a spec- 
tacular failure can be rather suc- 
cessful as a test. 

T HE favorite example told 
around the Cape is the failure 
of the first Atlas. The rocket 
started gyrating, tumbling and in 
general misbehaving. Finally it 
had to be deliberately destroyed 
in midair. But when all the test 
results were in, it was discovered 
that these amounted to about 95 
per cent of what the engineers 
had wanted to find out. The press 
labeled it a failure, plain and 
simple, and one newspaper even 
wrote an editorial that the whole 
program ought to be scrapped 
since the missile was so obviously 
unworkable. Now if that rocket 
had made a flight which the spec- 
tators had thought perfect, it would 
have been only five per cent bet- 
ter than the “failure” that actually 
happened. 

That does not apply to every 
shot that goes wrong. Testing is 
one thing, but if you shoot for a 
mission, the story is different. A 
lunar probe that does not go to 

79 



the Moon, a Jupiter-C that does 
not throw its top stage into an 
orbit, these are near-failures. I use 
this term because something is 
learned even in such a case. But if 
a rocket is fired just for testing, 
there cannot be a failure. 

Now what happens to a missile 
when it gets to the Cape? 

It arrives from the manufac- 
turer often by air lift, some, such 
as the Atlas, by trailer truck. The 
first job is what is called a han- 
gar check. Was anything damaged 
in transit? Do all the electrical 
connections work? Did sand or 
dust get into the missile? After the 
hangar check is completed, the 
missile goes to its launching pad. 
In its Gantry crane, the check- 
ing begins all over. This time 
other things are added. More in- 
strumentation, for instance. In gen- 
eral, all the missiles are weighed 
down with instrumentation which 
nobody in his right mind would 
put into the finished product. 
They are testing, remember, not 
firing rockets for amusement. 

A test fueling is part of the test- 
ing procedure on the pad, during 
a dress rehearsal count-down. Such 
a count-down will be interrupted 
for all kinds of reasons. The 
strangest such “hold” on record 
occurred when the contractor’s 
testing crew suddenly discovered 
an alligator in their block house. 
One of the officers tried to console 
them by saying that the alligator’s 
80 



presence was not authorized, but 
the engineers were in no mood for 
legal points — they rarely are — 
and called a hold until somebody 
removed the visitor. 

In time, everybody is satisfied 
that things should go well. The 
event itself is called a “shoot” — 
except by the people who do it 
They prefer the term “launch,” 
which inevitably gave rise to the 
telephone reply: “No, you can’t 
talk to Dr. Soandso now; he’s out 
to launch.” 

The time for the launch is set, 
let’s say, at 2300, or 11 p.m. EST. 
Incidentally, it depends on the 
test phase a missile is in whether 
the launch is during the day or 
during the night. When the missile 
is new, visual observation is ob- 
viously important, hence firing 
takes place in daylight. Later on, 
when all the information still to 
be gathered has to come from the 
instruments, the firing might just 
as well be scheduled after sunset, 
when it is cooler. 

S INCE this is testing, one has 
to count on something going 
wrong, in which case the missile 
must not be permitted to fall 
where it could do harm. To insure 
safety for outsiders, lines must be 
established on a map. In the cen- 
ter is the line which indicates the 
desired flight path. At some dis- 
tance to the right and left of this 
line, two lines are drawn which 
GALAXY 



are called the impact lines. If the 
missile has to fall, it must fall in- 
side these impact lines. But how? 

Let us assume that missile runs 
off course in the direltion of one 
of the impact lines. Then it has 
to be destroyed and its pieces 
must still fall inside the impact 
lines. Naturally there is a point 
which marks the last possible mo- 
ment for destruction. All these 
points form the two “destruct” 
lines inside the impact lines. If a 
missile crosses a “destruct” line, it 
must be destroyed. 

The width of the band between 
the destruct lines and the bands 
between destruct and impact lines 
vary for every type of missile; 
of course, no actual figures are 
handed out. The Range Safety Of- 
ficer in the Central Control build- 
ing cannot see anything directly, 
just like the people in the block- 
house. They don’t look through 
windows — they look at TV 
screens. And the Range Safety Of- 
ficer has another device to aid him, 
the impact computer. 

The impact computer gets its 
information from the radars and 
from instruments in the rocket and 
goes through a continuous process 
of calculation. The results of its 
labor appear on a map with two 
pointers. One pointer shows where 
the missile is at this instant. The 
other pointer shows where it would 
hit the water if its propulsion 
failed at that instant. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



The Range Safety Officer’s 
means of interfering consist of 
two toggle switches. One is labeled 
“fuel cut-off,” and when thrown, 
the result is what the label says. 
The other switch is labeled “de- 
struct” and it also does what the 
label says. They must be used in 
succession — the “destruct” switch 
will do absolutely nothing if the 
cut-off switch has not been used. 

So time has been set for 2300. 
At T-150 (minutes), all down- 
range stations are ready. All radars 
are in fine tune and no tracking 
camera is jammed. The devout 
hope is that they’ll stay that way 
and at T — 150 two airplanes take 
off. One is radar-equipped and 
sees to it that there are no ships 
between the impact lines. The 
other monitors all the radio fre- 
quencies to be used to see that 
there is no interference. 

The damnedest things can hap- 
pen. Once a radio-equipped laun- 
dry delivery van in a town many 
hundreds of miles away caused 
interference! 

Another safety measure is to 
divert all scheduled airliners. If 
no shoot is planned, the New York 
to Miami non-stop flight goes 
straight through the missile track, 
though probably at a different alti- 
tude. 

A T T-150, there is still not 
an ounce of fuel in the mis- 
sile, unless it is a solid-fuel job. 

81 



Fueling comes last, after the prob- 
ability that anything else may go 
wrong has dwindled to virtually 
nothing. Visitors usually assemble 
at T-90 in the office building at 
Patrick Air Force Base and are 
brought to the Cape by Air Force 
bus. The bus stops at Telemetry 
No. 3. (Usually a coffee and sand- 
wich wagon arrives at the same 
time.) When the visitors emerge 
from their bus, a message waits for 
them. It says “T-50 and count- 
ing.” Fifty minutes to go and no 
problems. 

By the time everybody is on 
top of the building, where there 
are a dozen phone booths for the 
use of the press, and by the time 
the newsmen have set up their 
cameras, a loudspeaker has been 
connected. “T minus 25 and count- 
ing,” it will say suddenly. On the 
evening I have in mind, the sky 
was clear, with all the stars out. 
Fairly high up, there was a nearly 
full Moon, and lower in the sky 
a red star was conspicuous: Mars. 
Things looked as if they had been 
arranged by Chesley Bonestell. 

Near the missile being made 
ready, a bright red light kept flash- 
ing. It is the customary signal that 
a missile is being readied. Ex- 
pressed in words, it just means 
“Stay Away.” As the loudspeaker 
said “T minus 20,” a battery of 
floodlights was switched on. The 
big rocket — it was an Atlas — was 
clearly visible. 



“T minus 15.” 

To anybody who did not know 
what was going on and who looked 
at the rocket through binoculars, 
it must have seemed as if some- 
thing had gone badly wrong. The 
rocket just spouted white vapor, 
top and bottom. The white vapor 
— actually atmospheric moisture 
condensing because of the cold 
oxygen gas that came from the 
tank vents — looked luminous and 
quite dense under the floodlight 
And the flashing red warning light 
made it appear as if a flame were 
developing any moment. 

“T minus 8.” 

“She’s still loxing,” said some- 
body who had just looked through 
the viewfinder of a powerful tele- 
photo camera. That strange term 
is derived from the unpretty ab- 
breviation for liquid oxygen: lox. 

“T minus 2.” 

The white vapor thinned. The 
valves must have been closed, or 
at least some of them. 

“T minus 45 seconds.” 

Close now, last and probably un- 
necessary camera adjustments. 

“T minus 15,” and then, ap- 
parently without pause, “7 . 
6... 5... 4... 3...” 

At “T minus 3,” the two small 
vernier rocket engines began 
spouting their thin flames. Im- 
mediately afterward, the whole 
launching pad lit up as if from an 
explosion.* All three major engines 
spouted fire. The rocket lifted. 



82 



GALAXY 



After two seconds or so, it had 
lifted itself out of the area illu- 
minated by the floodlights. The 
rocket became invisible; only the 
bright flames from the exhaust 
nozzles were there against the 
dark sky. 

All this was apparently without 
the faintest whisper of a sound. 
But at about the instant the rocket 
itself became nearly invisible, the 
sound had traveled the distance 
from launching pad to Telemetry 
No. 3. The thunder hit us and the 
roar seemed to get even stronger 
as the triple flame lifted upward. 

T THOUGHT somewhat auto- 
-*■ matically that the exhaust 
flames looked “good” and that the 
roar was “normal,” but these were 
side thoughts. I followed the 
flames as they lifted up. Higher, 
going faster, up, up. 



The rocket now seemed to be 
overhead and the flames were 
foreshortened. They changed into 
a most brilliant star which dwin- 
dled in size but did not seem to 
lessen in brilliance. 

Meanwhile, the loudspeaker 
continued counting, the so-called 
plus count, sounding unemotional 
and impersonal. 

“Plus 150.” 

At that instant, the star got 
much smaller. The two boosters 
had used up their fuel and only 
the main rocket motor kept going. 
I kept it in my glasses. The star 
was quite small now but still bril- 
liant. 

At “Plus 250,” it suddenly 
disappeared. Brennschluss — burn- 
out. 

The missile was on its way. 
And we went on ours.

for McGhee, I'd have happily left 
something for all the rest of you!

M argery tried putting 
the phone back on the 
hook, but it immediately 
rang again. She kicked the stand, 
picked up the phone and said : 
“Hang up, will you? We don’t 
want any!” She slammed the phone 
down to break the connection and 
took it off the hook again. 

The doorbell rang. 

“My turn,” I said and put down 
the paper— it looked as though I 
never would find out what the Na-

tional League standings were. 

It was Patrolman Gamelsfelder. 

“Man to see you, Mr. Binns. 
Says it’s important.” He was sweat- 
ing— you could see the black 
patches on his blue shirt. I knew 
what he was thinking: We had 
air conditioning and money, and 
he was risking his life day after 
day for a lousy policeman’s pay, 
and what kind of a country was 
this anyhow? He’d said as much 
that afternoon.

“It might be important to him, 
but I don’t want to see anybody. 
Sorry, officer.” I closed the door. 

Margery said: “Are you or are 
you not going to help me change 
the baby?” 

I said cheerfully: “I’ll be glad 
to, dear.” And it was true— besides 
being good policy to say that, be- 
cause she was pretty close to ex- 
ploding. It was true because I 
wanted something to do myself. I 
wanted some nice simple demand- 
ing task, like holding a one-year- 
old down with my knee in the 
middle of his chest, while one hand 
held his feet and the other one 
pinned the diaper. I mean it was 
nice of Uncle Otto to leave me 
the money, but did they have to 
put it in the paper? 

r 1^ HE doorbell rang again as I 
was finishing. Margery was up- 
stairs with Gwennie, who took a lot 
of calming down because she al- 
ways does, so I stood the baby on 
his fat little feet and answered the 
door myself. 

It was the policeman again. 
“Some telegrams for you, Mr. 
Binns. I wooden let the boy de- 
liver them.” 

“Thanks.” I tossed them in the 
drawer of the telephone stand. 
What was the use of opening 
them? They were from people who 
had heard about Uncle Otto and 
the money, and they wanted to 
beg, borrow or sell me something. 



“That fellow’s still here,” Patrol- 
man Gamelsfelder said sourly. “I 
think he’s sick.” 

“Too bad.” I tried to close the 
door. 

“Anyway, he says to tell Cud- 
dles that Tinker is here.” 

I grabbed the door. “Tell Cud-” 
“That’s what he said.” Gamels- 
felder saw that that hit me and 
it pleased him. For the first time, 
he smiled. 

“What— what’s his name?” 
“Winston McNeely McGhee,” 
said Officer Gamelsfelder happily, 
“or anyway that’s what he told 
me, Mr. Binns.” 

“Send the son of a— Send the 
fellow in,” I said, and jumped to 
get the baby away from the ash- 
tray where Margery had left a 
cigarette burning. 

Winnie McGhee. It was all I 
needed to finish off my day. 

He came in holding his head 
as though it weighed a thousand 
pounds. He was never what you'd 
call healthy-looking, even when 
Margery stood me up at the altar 
in order to elope with him. It was 
his frail, poetic charm, and maybe 
he still had that and maybe he 
didn’t, but the way he looked to 
me, he was sick, all right. He 
looked as if he weighed a fast 
hundred pounds, not counting the 
head; and the head looked like a 
balloon. 

He moaned, “Hello, Harlan, age

three. You got an acetysalicylic 
acid tablet?” 

I said: “What?” 

But he didn’t get a chance to 
answer right away because there 
was a flutter and a scurry from the 
expansion attic and Margery ap- 
peared at the head of the stairs. 

“I thought—” she began wildly, 
and then she saw that her wildest 
thought was true. “You!” 

She betrayed pure panic— she 
began fussing with her hair with 
one hand and smoothing her Ber- 
muda shorts with the other, while 
she was simultaneously trying to 
wiggle, no hands, out of the sloppy 
old kitchen apron that had been 
good enough for me. 

1V/|" cGHEE said pallidly: “Hello. 

Please, don’t you have an 
acetylsalicylic acid tablet?” 

“I don’t know what it is,” I told 
him. 

Margery chuckled ruefully. “Ah, 
Harlan, Harlan,” she said with fond 
tolerance, beaming lovingly at me 
as she came down the stairs. It 
was enough to turn the stomach of 
a cat. “You forget, Winnie— Har- 
lan doesn’t know much chemistry. 
Won’t you find him an aspirin, 
Harlan? That’s all he wants.” 
“Thanks,” said Winnie with a 
grateful sigh, massaging his 
temples. 

I went and got him an aspirin. 
I thought of adding a little mixer 
to the glass of water that went 



with it, but there wasn’t anything 
in the medicine chest that looked 
right, and besides it’s against the 
law. 

I don’t mind admitting it, I 
never liked Winnie McGhee, and 
it isn’t just because he swiped my 
bride away from me. Sure, she 
got smart after six months, and 
then when she turned up with an 
annulment and sincere repentance 
—well, I’ve never regretted marry- 
ing her. Or anyway, not much. 

But you can’t expect me to like 
McGhee. Hell, if I’d never seen 
the man before, I’d have hated his 
little purple guts at first sight, be- 
cause he looked like a poet and 
talked like a scientist and acted 
like a jerk. 

I started back to the living room 
and yelled: “The baby!” 

Margery turned away from sim- 
pering at her former husband and 
sprang for the puppy’s dish. She 
got it away from the baby, but not 
quite intact. There was a good 
baby-sized mouthful of mixed milk 
and dog-biscuit that she had to 
excavate for, and naturally the 
baby had his way of counter-at- 
tacking for that. 

“No bite!” she yelled, pulling 
her finger out of his mouth and 
putting it in hers. Then she smiled 
sweetly. “Isn’t he a darling, Win- 
nie? He’s got his daddy’s nose, of 
course. But don’t you think he has 
my eyes?” 

“He’ll have your fingers, too, if 
GALAXY

you don’t keep them out of his 
mouth,” I told her. 

Winnie said: “That’s normal. 
After all, with twenty-four paired 
chromosomes to form the gamete, 
it is perfectly obvious that the 
probability of inheriting none of 
his traits from one parent— that is, 
being exactly like the other— is one 
chance in 8,388,608. Ooh, my 
head.” 

Margery gave him a small 
frown. “What?” 

He was like a wound-up phono- 
graph. “That’s without allowance 
for spontaneous mutation,” he 
added. “Or induced. And consider- 
ing the environmental factors in 
utero — that is, broad-spectrum anti- 
biotics, tripling of the background 
radiation count due to nuclear 
weapons, dietary influences, et 
cetera— yes, I should put the proba- 
bility of induced mutation rather 
high. Perhaps of the order of—” 

I interrupted. “Here’s your aspi- 
rin. Now what do you want?” 

“Harlan!” Margery said warn- 
ingly. 

“I mean — well, what do you 
want?” 

He leaned his head on his hands. 
“I want you to help me conquer 
the world,” he said. 

Crash-splash. “Go get a mop!” 
Margery ordered; the baby had 
just spilled the puppy’s water. She 
glared at me, then smiled at Win- 
nie. “Go ahead,” she coaxed. “Take 
your nice aspirin and we’ll talk 



about your trip around the world 
later.” 

B UT that hadn’t been what he 
had said. Conquer the world. 
I heard it plain as day. I went to 
fetch the mop, because that was 
as good a way as any to think over 
what to do about Winston Mc- 
Neely McGhee. I mean what did 
I want with the world? Uncle Otto 
had already bequeathed me the 
world, or anyway more of it than 
I had ever hoped to own. 

When I came back, Winnie was 
tottering around the room, fol- 
lowed at a respectful distance by 
my wife, holding the baby. She 
was saying to the prospective con- 
queror of all the world: “How did 
you hear about Harlan’s good lu— 
about the tragic loss of his dear 
uncle, I mean?” 

He groaned: “I read it in the 
paper.” He fiddled aimlessly with 
the phone. 

“It’s all for the best, I say,” said 
Margery in" a philosophic tone, fish- 
ing damp graham-cracker crumbs 
out of the baby’s ear. “Dear Uncle 
Otto lived a rich and full life. 
Think of all those years in Yemen! 
And the enormous satisfaction it 
must have given him to be per- 
sonally responsible for the instal- 
lation of the largest petroleum- 
cracking still west of the Suez!” 
“East, my dear. East. The Muta- 
wakelite Kingdom lies just south 
of Saudi Arabia.” 



THE BITTEREST PILL 



89 



She looked at him thoughtfully, 
but all she said was: “Winnie, 
you’ve changed.” 

And so he had; but, for that 
matter, so had she. It was not like 
Margery to be a hypocrite. 

Simpering over her ex-husband 
I could understand— it wasn’t so 
bad; she was merely showing the 
poor guy how very much better 
off she was than she ever would 
have been with him. 

But the tragic loss of my dear 
uncle had never occasioned a mo- 
ment’s regret in her— or in me; be- 
cause the plain fact of the matter 
is that until the man from the As- 
sociated Press called up, she didn’t 
even know I had an Uncle Otto. 
And I had pretty nearly forgotten 
it myself. Otto was the brother that 
my mother’s family didn’t talk 
about. How were they to know 
that he was laying up treasures of 
oil and gold on the Arabian Penin- 
sula? 

The phone rang; Winnie had 
thoughtlessly put it back on the 
hook. “No!” Margery cried into it, 
hardly listening. “We don’t want 
any uranium stock! We’ve got 
closets full of it!” 

I said, taking advantage of the 
fact that her attention was di- 
verted: “Winnie, I’m a busy man. 
How about if you tell me what 
you want?” 

He sat down with his head in his 
hands and made a great effort. 

“It’s — difficult,” he said, speak- 

90 



ing very slowly. Each word came 
out by itself, as though he had to 
choose and sort painfully among 
all the words that were rushing to 
his mouth. “I — invented some- 
thing. You understand? And 
when I heard about you inherit- 
ing money—” 

“You thought you could get 
some of it away from me.” 

“No!” He sat up sharply— and 
winced and clutched his head. “I 
want to make money for you.” 
“We’ve got closets full,” I quoted 
Margery. 

He said in a desperate tone : 
“But I can give you the world, 
Harlan. Trust me!” 

“I never have—” 

“Trust me now! We can own 
the world, the two of us, if you’ll 
just give me a little financial help. 
I’ve invented a drug that gives me 
total recall.” 

“How nice for you,” I said, 
reaching for the knob of the door. 

T HEN I began to think. “Total 
recall?” I asked. 

He said, sputtering with eager- 
ness: “The upwelling of the un- 
conscious— the ability to remember 
everything— the eidetic memory of 
an idiot savant and the indexing 
system of a quiz winner! You want 
to know the first six kings of 
England? Egbert, Ethelwulf, Ethel- 
bald, Ethelbert, Ethelred and 
Alfred. You want to know the mat- 
ing call of a ruff-necked grouse?” 

GALAXY 



He demonstrated the call of the 
ruff-necked grouse. 

“Oh,” said Margery, coming 
back into the room with the fresh- 
ly diapered baby. “Bird imita- 
tions.” 

“And more!” cried Winnie. “Do 
you know about the time the Unit- 
ed States had two presidents?” 

“No, but-” 

“March the third,” he said, 
“eighteen seventy-seven. Ruther- 
ford B. Hayes— I’d better say 
Rutherford Birchard Hayes— was 
about to succeed Grant and he was 
sworn in a day early. I ought to 
explain that—” 

“No,” I cut in. “Don’t explain.” 

“Well, how about this? Want 
me to name the A.B.C. bowling 
champions from 1931 to date? 
Clack, Nitschke, Hewitt, Vidro, 
Brokaw, Gagliardi, Anderson— oh, 
wait a minute. I forgot 1936. 
That’s Warren. Then Gagliardi, 
Anderson, Danek— ” 

“Winnie,” I said, “quit it.” 

“But this is the key to conquer- 
ing the world!” 

“Hah,” I said. “Being boring 
from within by naming bowling 
champions?” 

“Knowledge is power, Harlan.” 
He rested his head on his palms 
briefly. “But it does make my head 
ache.” 

I took my hand off the knob of 
the door. 

I said grudgingly: “Sit down, 
Winnie. I admit you’ve got me in- 



terested. I can’t wait to hear what 
the swindle is.” 

“Harlan!” warned Margery. 

Winnie said: “There’s no 

swindle, I promise you. To repeat, 
knowledge is power, Harlan. Why, 
with my super-brain we can outwit 
the rulers of any country any- 
where. We can own the world! 
And— money, you say? Knowledge 
is money, too. For instance—” he 
winked— “worried about taxes? I 
can tell you the minority opinion 
in U. S. Govt, versus Oosterhagen, 
486 Alabama 3309. There’s a 
loophole there you could drive an 
armored truck through and come 
out with it loaded!” 

11/TARGERY sat down with a 
-L” cigarette in the long, long 
holder I’d bought her to square a 
beef the year after we were mar- 
ried. She looked at me and then 
at the cigarette; it penetrated and 
I raced over with a match. 

“Thank you, darling,” she said 
throatily. 

She had changed herself as well 
as the baby. She now wore some- 
thing more suitable for the co- 
heiress of a big fat hunk of money 
to wear while entertaining an ex- 
husband. It was a gold lame house- 
coat; she had bought it within an 
hour of the time the AP man had 
called, on a charge account we’d 
never owned until the early edi- 
tions of the papers hit the stores 
around Levittown. 



THE BITTEREST PILL 



91 



And that reminded me. Money. 
Who needed money? What was 
the use of inheriting all that loot 
from Uncle Otto if I couldn’t 
throw Winnie out on his ear? 

Politeness made me temporize: 
“All this is very interesting, Win- 
nie, but—” 

“Harlan, the baby!” Margery 
yelled. “Get him out of the 
pretzels!” 

I did, while Winnie said faintly 
behind me: “The shape of a 

pretzel represents children’s arms 
folded in prayer— or so it was 
thought in the seventh century. A 
good pretzel bender can bend more 
than thirty-five a minute. Of 
course, machines are faster.” 

I said: “Winnie—” 

“Like to know the etymology of 
the word ‘navvy 5 ? Most people 
think it has something to do with 
sailors.” 

“Winnie, listen to me—” 

“It doesn’t, though. It comes 
from the laborers on the Inland 
N avigation Canals— eighteenth-cen- 
tury England, you know. Well, 
the laborers—” 

I said firmly: “Winnie, beat it.” 

“Harlan!” 

“You stay out of this, Margery,” 
I ordered her. “Winnie’s after my 
dough, that’s all. Well, I haven’t 
had it long enough to want to 
throw it away. Besides, who wants 
to rule the world?” 

“Well—” Margery said thought- 
fully. 

92 



“With all our money?” I de- 
manded. “Who needs it?” 

W INNIE clutched his head. 

“Oh,” he moaned. “Wait, Har- 
lan. All I need is a stake. I’ve got 
the long-term cycles of every stock 
on the Exchange down in my head 
—splits and dividends and earnings 
records since nineteen ought four! 
I know the private brokers’ hand 
signals on the Curb— wave up for 
buy, wave down for sell; look, see 
how my fingers are bent? That 
means the spread between bid and 
asked is three-eighths of a point. 
Give me a million dollars, Harlan.” 
“No.” 

“Just a million, that’s all. You 
can spare it! And I’ll double it in 
a week, quadruple it in a month- 
in a year, we’ll have a billion. A 
billion dollars!” 

I shook my head. “The taxes—” 
“Remember U. S. Govt, versus 
Oosterhagen! And that’s a bare be- 
ginning. Ever think what a billion 
dollars could do in the hands of a 
super-genius? Here!” he yelled, 
grabbing at his temple with one 
hand, pulling something out of 
his pocket with the other. “Look 
at this, Harlan! It’s yours for a 
million dollars— ah, make it a 
hundred thousand. Yes, a hundred 
thousand dollars and you can have 
it! I’ll sell it for that and then I 
won’t split with you— we’ll both 
be super-geniuses. Eh? Fair 
enough?” 



GALAXY 



I was trapped by my own curi- 
osity. “What is it?” I asked. 

He waved it at me— a squat little 
bottle, half filled with pale cap- 
sules. 

“Mine,” he said proudly. “My 
hormone. It’s a synapse relaxer. 
One of these and the blocks be- 
tween cell and cell in your brain 
are weakened for an hour. Three 
of them, for every twenty pounds 
of body weight, and you’re a su- 
per-genius for life. You’ll remem- 
ber things you think have passed 
out of your recollection years ago! 
You’ll recall the post-partum slap 
that started you breathing. You’ll 
remember the name of the nurse 
who carried you to the door of 
your father’s Maxwell. Harlan, 
there is simply no limit to—” 

“Beat it, Winnie,” I said, and 
pushed him. 

DATROLMAN Gamelsf elder 
appeared like a genie from a 
lamp. 

“Thought so,” he said somber- 
ly, advancing on Winnie McGhee. 
“Extortion’s your game, is it? Can’t 
say I blame you, brother, but it’s 
a trip to the station house and a 
talk with the sergeant for you.” 

“Just get rid of him,” I said, 
and closed the door as Winnie was 
challenging the cop to name an 
opera by Krenek, other than John- 
ny Spielt Aui. 

Margery put the baby down, 
breathing hard. 



She said: “Scuffling and push- 
ing people around and bad man- 
ners. You weren’t like this when 
we were married, Harlan. Some- 
thing’s come over you since you 
inherited that money!” 

I said: “Help me pick these 
things up, will you?” I hadn’t 
pushed him hard, but all the same, 
those pills had gone flying. 

Margery stamped her foot and 
burst into tears. “I know how you 
feel' about poor Winnie,” she 
sobbed, “but it’s just that I’m 
sorry for him. Couldn’t you at 
least be polite? Couldn’t you at 
least have given him a couple of 
lousy hundred thousand dollars?” 

“Watch the baby,” I warned 
her. At the head of the stairs, 
Gwennie appeared, attracted by 
the noise, rubbing her eyes with 
her fists and beginning to cry. 

Margery glared at me, started to 
speak, was speechless, turned her 
back and hurried up to comfort 
Gwennie. 

I began to feel a little bit 
ashamed of myself. 

I stood up, patting the baby ab- 
sent-mindedly on the head, look- 
ing up the stairs at the female half 
of our household. I had been, when 
you stopped to think of it, some- 
thing of a clunk. 

Item, I had been rough on poor 
old Winnie. Suppose it had been 
I who discovered the hormone and 
needed a few lousy hundred 
thousand, as Margery put it so 



THE BITTEREST PILL 



93 



well, as a stake in order to grasp 
undreamed-of wealth and power? 

And, item, Margery did have a 
tough time with the kids and all, 
and on this day of all days, she 
was likely excited. 

And, item— 

I had just inherited a bloody 
mint! 

nr HE thought came to me with 
sudden appalling clarity— why 
wasn’t I using some of Uncle Otto’s 
money to make like easier? 

I galloped up the steps two at 
a time. “Margery! I’m sorry!” 

“I think you should—” she be- 
gan, and then looked up from 
Gwennie and saw my face. 

I said: “Look, honey. Let’s start 
over. I’m sorry about poor Win- 
nie, but forget him, huh? We’re 
rich. Let’s start living the way 
rich people do. Let’s go out, just 
the two of us— it’s early yet! We’ll 
grab a cab and go into New York 
—all the way by cab— why not? 
We’ll eat at the Colony and see 
My Fair Lady from the fifth row 
on the aisle—” 

Margery looked up at me and 
suddenly smiled. “But—” She 
patted Gwennie’s head. “The kids. 
What about them?” 

“Get a baby - sitter. Mrs. 
Schroop’ll be glad of the work.” 
“But it’s such short notice—” 
“Margery,” I said, “we don’t in- 
herit a fortune every night. Call 
her up.” 



Margery stood up, holding 
Gwennie, beginning to smile. 
“Why, that sounds like fun, Har- 
lan! Why not, as you say? Only 
—do you remember Mrs. Schroop’s 
number?” 

“It’s written down,” I told her. 

“No, that was on the cover of 
the old directory.” She frowned. 
“It isn’t listed in her own name— 
it’s her son-in-law. Oh, what is 
that number—” 

A thin voice from down the 
stairs said: “Ovington Eight Zero 
Zero Fourteen. It’s listed under 
Sturgis, Arthur R., Forty-one Uni- 
verse Avenue.” 

I said sharply: “Who the devil 
said that?” 

“I did, Daddy,” said the owner 
of the voice, all of eighteen inches 
tall, appearing at the foot of the 
steps. He had to use one hand to 
steady himself, because he didn’t 
walk so very well. But in the other 
hand, he held the squat glass bottle 
that Winnie McGhee had dropped. 

The bottle was empty. 

YV7ELL, we don’t live in Levit- 
town any more— of course. 

Marjorie and Gwennie and I 
have tried everything — changing 
our name, dyeing our hair, even 
plastic surgery once. It didn’t work, 
so we had the same surgeon 
change us back. 

People kept recognizing us. 

What we mostly do now is 
cruise up and down the coast of 



94 



GALAXY 



the U.S.J.I. in our yacht, inside the 
twelve-mile limit. When we need 
supplies, we send some of the crew 
in with the motor launch. That’s 
risky, yes. But it isn’t as risky as 
landing in any other country would 
be and we just don’t want to go 
back to J.I.— as they’ve taken to 
calling it these days. You can’t 
blame us. How would you like it? 

The way it goes, we just cruise 
up and down, and every once in 
a while he remembers us and calls 
up on the ship-to-shore. He called 
yesterday, matter of fact. 

He said: “You can’t stay out 
there forever, Daddy. Your main 
engines are due for a refit after 
eleven months seven days of run- 
ning and you’ve been gone ten 
months six. What are you using 
for dairy products? The load you 
shipped in Jacksonville must have 
run out last Thursday week. There 
isn’t any point in your starving 
yourself. Besides, it’s not fair to 
Gwennie and Mom. Come home. 
We’ll make a place for you in 
the government.” 

“Thanks,” I said. “But no, 
thanks.” 

“You’ll be sorry,” he cautioned, 
pleasantly enough. And he hung 
up. 

Well, we should have kept him 
out of those pills. 

I guess it was my fault. I should 
have listened when old Winnie— 
heaven rest his soul, wherever he 
is— said that the lifetime dose was 

THE BITTEREST PILL 



three tablets for every twenty 
pounds of body weight. The baby 
only weighed thirty-one pounds 
then, last time we’d taken him to 
the pediatrician; naturally, we 
couldn’t take him again after he. 
swallowed the pills. > And he 
must’ve swallowed at least a dozen. 

B UT I guess Winnie was right. 

At the very least, the world is 
well on its way to being conquered 
now. 

The United States fell to Ju- 
vens Imperator, as he calls him- 
self (and I blame Margery for 
that— I never used Latin in front 
of the kids) in eighteen months, 
after his sensational coup on the 
$256,000 Question and his later 
success in cornering soybean fu- 
tures, the common stock of United 
States Steel, other shares and com- 
modities, then just about all of 
them. The rest of the world is 
just a matter of time. And not 
very much time at that. And don’t 
they just know it, though; that’s 
why we daren’t land abroad. 

But who would have thought it? 
I mean I watched his inaugura- 
tion last October on television. The 
country has had some pretty pecul- 
iar people running it, no doubt. 
But did you ever think you’d live 
to see the oath of office adminis- 
tered to a little boy with one hand 
upraised and the thumb of the 
other in his mouth?

Piloting one routine sightseeing space jaunt 

was all he had done . and it landed him in a 
one-man peep show billed as the notorious . 



By j. t. McIntosh 

Illustrated by WOOD 



T HE Spurcans behind Al- 
lan Simber in the control 
cabin of the little ship were 
whistling excitedly. Shaped rather 
like .balloons shaped like human 
beings, they had no backbone and 
virtually no bones, and the sibi- 
lant way they spoke showed they 
had no teeth either. 

The members of the royal party 
were happy. They were delighted 
and relieved that this brief trip 
into outer space, just to be able to 
say they’d been, had gone so 
smoothly. 

It was one of the least queer 
charters Allan had ever taken, for 
a private charter space pilot gets a 
lot of queer jobs. Except for the 
passengers, it was completely rou- 
tine. 

On landing at Spurc with a one- 
shot cargo from Rigel, he had been 

96 




GALAXY 



asked if his ship was absolutely 
safe and if he was fully compe- 
tent to handle it alone. He said 
yes, of course, was asked if he 
would so state in an affidavit, re- 
plied he would, signed the afore- 
said affidavit — and was given a 
contract to take King Phunk and 
several members of the royal 
retinue out into the void to see 
what it was like. One of the King’s 
titles was King of Heaven, so it 
was only natural that he should 
want to take a close look at his 
own property. 

Now, having flown around 
Spurc’s two small satellites, the 
King and his retinue were not at 
all sorry to see the surface of their 
own world in the screens, gently 
coming up to meet them. This 
they understood. Though the Spur- 
cans had never developed space 
travel, they had been using flying 
machines of one kind or another 
for centuries. 

TJ OTIN, the only member of 
the royal party who could 
speak English, lollupped up to 
Allan and asked in a whispered 
whistle if he was going to be able 
to land anywhere near the palace 
at Pluc. 

“Sure,” Allan said. “I mean yes. 
In the courtyard, if you like.” 

“Take no risks,” warned the 
Spurcan. “Do it gentle, please, and 
agitate not the King.” 

“This landing,” Allan said reas- 



suringly, “will be as gentle as—” 

He didn’t get a chance to com- 
plete the simile. The ship lurched 
abruptly and began to spin violent- 
ly. Checking his controls, Allan 
found that a braking jet had failed, 
and the compensator which was 
supposed to fix such a situation 
had failed too. 

It took five minutes’ desperate 
work that demanded all his consid- 
erable skill to get any sort of or- 
der into the story his dials told 
him, and by that time he knew 
that the landing wasn’t going to 
be gentle at all, but exceedingly 
hard. Also there was no longer any 
guarantee where they would land. 
He’d settle for any kind of land- 
ing, anywhere, that left the ship 
in one piece. 

He glanced over his shoulder. 
The bulbous little Spurcans had 
clustered protectively round their 
King and there was no more whis- 
tling. They didn’t have to be told 
there was something wrong. Well, 
there was nothing he could tell 
them that would make any dif- 
ference. They’d just have to take 
their chances, like him and the 
ship. 

He still couldn’t understand the 
the ship? Potin and the other Eng- 
failure. Could some political 
enemy of the King have sabotaged 
lish-speaking Spurcans had pooh- 
poohed any suggestion of putting a 
guard on the ship in which the 
King was to travel. The idea that 



98 



GALAXY 



a Spurcan should wish to harm 
King Phunk was unthinkable, and 
Potin refused to consider it. 

Allan wasn’t so sure. And he 
wished cordially that any disgrun- 
tled Spurcan subject who felt a 
pressing need to liquidate his mon- 
arch could have arranged it with- 
out involving Allan Simber and his 
ship. 

An instant before contact, Al- 
lan shouted: “Now!” and curled 
himself into shock position. 

The long slim ship landed on 
hard rock on a single fin. The fin 
crumpled, but its resilience had 
been enough to bounce the ship 
back in the air, where she fell over 
like a leaping salmon and crashed 
back on her belly. This time, as 
she bounced again, she turned 
nose-down and plunged at the rock, 
piling up on a broadening base of 
crumpled metal. 

Deafened and bruised, but still 
conscious, Allan looked around the 
mangled cabin. The King and his 
retinue were smears of various 
sizes, shapes and colors on the 
floor, walls and ceiling. 

HT HE conditions of imprison- 

ment on Spurc varied with the 
crime and the degree of guilt. A 
Spurcan decidedly guilty of a 
small crime was kept in an ex- 
ceedingly confined space. Anyone 
only potentially guilty of a large 
crime was kept in an exceedingly 
large space. 



Allan Simber, accused of the 
murder of King Phunk, was po- 
tentially guilty of so vast a crime 
that the only fit place for his in- 
carceration was the palace at Pluc. 
It was duly emptied of all its oc- 
cupants and sentried by all ten 
thousand members of the Royal 
Guard. 

He wasn’t badly treated, and, 
having the entire palace to roam, 
he didn’t feel too restricted. True, 
the largest couches or beds were 
less than four feet square, and the 
whole place had an overpowering 
scent of Spurcans, but men who 
spend their working lives in small 
spaceships, ferrying every conceiv- 
able cargo under the suns, get 
used to cramped bunks and sour 
air and learn to bear them philo- 
sophically. 

He knew he could expect no 
help from Earth. It always took 
the attitude that Terrans who in- 
sisted on going to other worlds 
would just have to take pot-luck 
with the local laws and the local 
legal system. But Allan still wasn’t 
worried about the outcome. 

No doubt it was inevitable that 
any pilot under whose care the 
King came to an unpleasant end 
should be formally charged with 
negligence. Allan’s case was clear 
— anyone who had evil designs on 
the King logically wouldn’t risk 
killing himself merely on the off- 
chance that he’d escape and King 
Phunk wouldn’t.

Besides, these little Spurcans 
were reasonable enough creatures, 
though they had some queer ideas 
— housing a major defendant in 
a vast prison, for example. Yet 
even that made sense of a sort. 
The reasoning was that it was an 
insult to accuse any man of any 
crime, and the bigger the crime, 
the bigger the insult. Consequent- 
ly, though someone suspected of 
a mammoth crime couldn’t be al- 
lowed to roam around loose, he 
was given as much freedom as 
possible and treated with respect 
and consideration. 

The only disturbing feature was 
that nobody told him anything and 
nobody came to see him. He was 
left alone in a palace which could 
house twelve thousand people. 

The first day he amused him- 
self by painting SIMBER ))))) > 
at strategic points on the walls 
all over the palace, the arrows 
pointing to the suite he had re- 
served for himself. After all, if the 
Spurcans didn’t want their palace 
desecrated, they shouldn’t have 
left any paint about. 

On the outer door of the suite 
he painted: 

ALLAN H. SIMBER 

CHIEF PILOT 
KNOCK AND ENTER 

The second day he was wonder- 
ing what to do when he heard foot- 
steps — human footsteps — ring- 



ing in the corridors far away. They 
paused, presumably while the vis- 
itor looked for another arrow. 
Then they restarted again, pre- 
sumably when he had found one. 

Presently there was a knock 
and John Carruthers entered. 



A FEW hundred humans, gab- 
eroids and minscods lived in 
the cosmopolitan quarter of Pluc, 
trading or studying the customs, 
law, psychology, history, topog- 
raphy or botany of Spurc. Allan 
had seen Carruthers at the space- 
port, but had no idea what exact- 
ly he was or did. 

Anyway, he was glad to see him 
now. Carruthers was unbelievably 
British. He wore riding breeches, 
though there had never been a 
horse on Spurc, and spoke with an 
accent which would have made 
most people think of Oxford or 
Cambridge, except possibly grad- 
uates of Oxford or Cambridge. 

“Well, old boy,” said Carruthers 
genially, “you do seem to have 
got yourself into a spot of bother.” 

“I do,” Allan admitted. “What 
are you— counsel for the defense?” 
“No,” said Carruthers apolo- 
getically. “There’s no defense, you 
see. Actually, I’m your American 
ambassador.” 

“American?” Allan automati- 
cally echoed, though it was what 
Carruthers had said first which was 
occupying his mind to the exclu- 
sion of all else. 

x-t>’ 



gala;

“American— also British, French, 
Chinese, Italian, German, Nor- 
wegian and Dutch. The other 
countries have made no arrange- 
ments to be represented.” 

Allan went back to the main 
point. “What do you mean, there’s 
no defense? You mean they’re not 
proceeding with the charge?” 

“No, my dear fellow. I mean 
you’re guilty. You are, you know. 
Incidentally, before you start un- 
burdening your soul, perhaps I’d 
better point out that the whole 
palace is probably wired.” 

Allan shut his mouth abruptly. 
Was that a warning that Car- 
ruthers himself couldn’t say what 
he liked, that he had said Allan 
was guilty simply because the 
Spurcans might be listening? No, 
that was ridiculous. 

“I’m guilty?” Allan said incredu- 
lously. 

“Oh, indubitably! You must 
have been out of your mind when 
you signed that affidavit, old chap. 
You did nothing less than make 
yourself personally responsible for 
the safety of the King and his 
party.” 

Allan remembered the affidavit 
with misgivings. “But surely—” 
“These people have no space- 
ships of their own, you know— just 
whatever old barges we can fob off 
on them. All they know about 
space is what we’ve chosen to tell 
them. We, of course, are the ex- 
perts. When you said your ship 



was sound and an accident was 
practically impossible — naturally, 
if the King was killed, you mur- 
dered him.” 

C LOWLY, Allan realized the 
^ full import of what Carruthers 
was saying. “You mean they’re 
not even going to try me?” 

“Oh, there’ll be a trial tomor- 
row. You won’t be there. It’ll be 
formal, with a verdict of guilty. 
I came to talk to you about your 
punishment. Thought you’d better 
know what to expect.” 

Allan sank weakly on one of 
the four-foot-square couches. Sure- 
ly if all this was true, Carruthers 
would hardly be so breezily cheer- 
ful about it all. 

“Is this some kind of a joke?” 
he asked. 

“No joke at all, old boy. I must 
say you asked for it. Everybody 
knew for days that you were going 
to take the rajah up. That you’d 
promised it was safe. That there 
was no guard on the ship. Any- 
body who had any reason to want 
the old gentleman out of the way 
had only to—” 

“But that’s exactly it!” Allan ex- 
claimed. “That’s precisely what 
must have happened! When the 
ship cracked up I — well, I was 
ninety-five per cent certain there 
had been sabotage. Surely I can 
bring this up in court and . .” 

He stopped. Carruthers was 
shaking his head. “Apart from the 



Kl NGSLAYER 



101 



fact that that’s not legally relevant, 
it just isn’t so. Take it from me, 
old boy, I’ve been here ten years 
and if anybody knows the Spur- 
cans I do. Some murders are rela- 
tively unimportant. I expect Phunk 
had quite a few characters knocked 
off in his time, so I daresay he 
only got what was coming to him. 
But no Spurcan — absolutely none 
— would kill his King, any more 
than you’d throw a million dol- 
lars into space. The King is valu- 
able, you see. You’ll be punished 
not because these people felt great 
affection for King Phunk, but be- 
cause you destroyed a valuable 
property.” 

“But . .” 

“Anyway,” Carruthers went on 
cheerfully, “even if you don’t take 
my word for it, the fact remains 
that the line of defense you 
planned holds no water, so to 
speak. You made yourself respon- 
sible for the King. He’s dead. 
That’s all that matters in Spur- 
can law. Now about your punish- 
ment. There will be three penal- 
ties—” 

“Is that all fixed too?” Allan 
asked dazedly. 

“More or less. The first punish- 
ment is starvation. For five hours.” 

A LLEN frowned. “Five hours?” 
“That’s inflexible— you know 
the Spurcans have to eat or drink 
something every half-hour or so. 
You’re lucky. After five hours’ 



starvation, a Spurcan is three-quar- 
ters dead.” 

“And they won’t modify this for 
a human? Are you sure?” 

“Quite sure, for all of us here 
run foul of their laws at one time 
or another and are sentenced to 
the first two penalties. No non- 
native has ever been sentenced to 
your particular third penalty so 
far. You’ll be making history, my 
dear fellow. The three penalties—” 
“Look,” said Allan, making up 
his mind. “You may be right about 
all this, but I’d rather wait for the 
verdict.” 

Carruthers was surprised and 
pained. “You don’t want me to tell 
you any more?” 

“Not now.” 

“But don’t you want to know 
about—” 

“Is there anything I can do to 
get out of this? Anything I per- 
sonally can do?” 

“ ’Fraid not, old chap.” 

“All right then, I’ve got to leave 
it to you. You’ll do what you can?” 
“Naturally, but . This is most 
embarrassing. You see, there’s ab- 
solutely nothing I can do.” 

Allan’s brain raced. “Just a mo- 
ment. There are humans here, and 
some gaberoids from Deneb and 
Merkat, and a few minscods from 
Mars, Sirius and Cephis. Right? 
What if one of them wanted to 
murder the King? They might 
have sabotaged the ship.” 

For the first time, a hint of mild 



102 



GALAXY 



irritation crossed Carruthers’ face. 
“Can’t you get it into your head,” 
he said, “that it wouldn’t do you 
any damn good even if you could 
prove that somebody tinkered 
your ship? Suppose I went into 
court tomorrow and said I burned 
half your braking fin off. They 
might put me on trial too, but that 
wouldn’t do you the slightest good. 
You still would be guilty of regi- 
cide.” 

“I see,” said Allan. “Oh, well. 
Can you come tomorrow and tell 
me what’s been decided?” 

“Of course. You don’t want me 
to tell you about . .? No, I see 
you don’t. Still, there’s one thing 
I must tell you—” 

“If you don’t mind,” said Allan, 
“I’d rather wait.” 

“But this is—” 

“Look,” said Allan, “I learned a 
long time ago to take things as 
they come. I’d have terrified my- 
self to death a dozen times if I’d 
assumed the worst, and the worst 
after that, and the worst after that. 
Right at this moment, nobody’s 
slapping me on the belly with a 
wet fish. Let’s leave it at that — 
okay?” 

Carruthers shrugged, hurt. 

OR now, at least, the Spur- 
-*■ cans certainly weren’t starv- 
ing him. Every third or fourth 
room had tables covered with fruit, 
sweetmeats, salads, cold meat, 
drinks of all kinds, and Allan let as 



little of it as possible go to waste. 

Long ago he had found out that 
one man’s meat was very seldom 
another man’s poison, at any rate 
on worlds of similar metabolism. 
The Spurcans were warm-blooded, 
carbon - based oxygen - breathers. 
Most of their food suited humans. 
The rare exceptions looked, 
smelled or tasted unpleasant. 

Eating with considerable enjoy- 
ment, Allan reflected that there 
was a lot to be said for Spurc. The 
climate was excellent and the food 
was wonderful. The little Spur- 
cans, though definitely non-human, 
were by no means repulsive and 
they were pretty reasonable. He 
had found no difficulty in getting 
along with them. 

The present situation was awk- 
ward but unlikely to be fatal. 
True, it was pretty silly of him to 
have signed that affidavit. Some- 
body should have told him. He ad- 
mitted fairly, however, that he 
could easily have sought out the 
ambassador for advice, and hadn’t. 

Every pilot who takes a small 
ship around the Galaxy alone must 
be an optimist. And every pilot 
who has done it reasonably suc- 
cessfully for five years must have 
good reason for his optimism. 

At least twenty times in the 
past five years, Allan Simber had 
been in situations from which the 
only person who expected him to 
emerge alive had been Allan Sim- 
ber. And if 'a thing goes on hap- 



Kl NGSLAYER

pening long enough, one develops 
skill in waiting it out. 

For something to do, he 
searched for the concealed micro- 
phones and wires against which 
Carruthers had warned him. He 
found no sign of any such thing. 
Apparently he was under no direct 
supervision. Ten thousand Spur- 
cans guarded the entrances, exits 
and walls. Within the generous 
boundaries of his prison, he was 
free. 

The only thing that irked him 
was the silence. Poor little King 
Phunk had liked silence, apparent- 
ly. Every room was sound-dead- 
ened; there were no windows in 
the palace and every ventilator 
seemed to have a sound-trap fitted. 
If Allan wanted to hear a sound, 
he had to make it himself. 

It was because of the blank still- 
ness that he heard something he 
would normally have missed. 
Someone or something was mov- 
ing in the corridor outside. Not 
boldly, openly, like Carruthers, but 
stealthily, so silently that a breath 
of wind or even a ticking clock 
might have covered the soft pad- 
ding. 

Maybe they were guarding him 
closely after all. Yet the furtive 
sound didn’t suggest Spurcans to 
Allan. They made a kerplunk, 
kerplunk, kerplunk on their short, 
heavy legs, no more capable of 
tiptoeing than bipedal pigmy ele- 
phants. 



Whoever or whatever was try- 
ing to conceal its presence must 
be trying to conceal it from Allan. 
So he stood behind the door and 
waited for a while to surprise his 
visitor if it elected to come in. 

Allan wasn’t excited, merely in- 
terested. As he waited, he won- 
dered whether to throw himself on 
the visitor the instant the door 
opened, if it did open. Might as 
well, he thought. If it was some- 
thing he couldn’t handle, at least 
he’d probably manage to bowl it 
off its feet — providing it had any 
feet. 

Whatever it was, it could hardly 
be friendly. 

Seconds passed and there was 
no sound. Allan was sure that the 
visitor was on the other side of 
the door, also listening. Well, in 
any contest of patience, Allan 
would win. Space pilots are un- 
beatable at waiting for nothing to 
happen. 

The door opened a crack, then 
opened wider. 

Allan sprang. Under him was 
something wet, slippery, but not 
repulsive. 

It was a completely female 
feminine human mammal. He 
could see that with both eyes. 

AS he helped her up apologeti- 
cally, Allan began to wonder 
who was crazy. 

The girl was a tall, well-stacked 
blonde with curves about which 



104 



GALAXY 



her two-piece swim suit was not 
reticent. Despite the swim suit and 
the water glistening on her skin, 
she was anything but an Amazon. 
She was definitely the crinoline, 
powder-and-patch type, the type 
whose bathing suit seldom gets 
wet. 

In fact, she looked like an 
actress making an improbable ap- 
pearance in a not very good movie. 

“Don’t tell me,” he said. “You’ve 
come to rescue me.” 

She was still gasping and rub- 
bing her diaphragm, with which 
Allan’s knee had made violent 
contact 

“As a matter of fact, I did,” she 
said in an injured tone. 

“Did what?” 

“Come to rescue you. I know a 
way out.” 

“You think you can get me out 
of here?” said Allan incredulously. 

“I know I can, but not now. Fol- 
low me.” 

He did so, willingly. 

“Who are you?” he asked. 

“Dawn Clifford. As if it mat- 
ters.” 

“I think it matters.” 

She was almost running through 
the corridors. Once Allan steadied 
her as her bare foot slipped on 
the polished floor. 

Right in the center of the pal- 
ace, they came to a fountain in 
the floor. 

“Ah,” he said softly. 

“I came this way,” said Dawn, 



“and I’m going back the same way. 
Can you swim?” 

“Yes.” 

“Under water?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then you’re okay. Only you 
can’t come now — we’d have to 
come up in the middle of a pub- 
lic pool. It’ll have to be at night, 
and not tonight either. I’m busy. 
I’ll come for you tomorrow night.” 
“Can’t I make it myself?” 

“Not without a guide. Don’t try. 
You’d drown.” 

She slipped into the fountain 
and began to lower herself toward 
a grating in the clear, cool water. 

“Wait,” Allan protested. “Why 
are you doing this? What—” 

“I haven’t time,” she said nerv- 
ously, not looking at him. “I’ve 
got to get back to the pool before 
I’m missed. See you tomorrow 
night.” 

Drawing a deep breath, she 
dropped under the surface to the 
grating. It was hinged. Once she 
had pushed herself through the 
aperture, the grating closed firmly 
behind her. 

Z"' 1 ARRUTHERS made his sec- 
ond appearance the next day. 
“Well, old boy,” he said apolo- 
getically, “it was just as I told 
you.” 

“You mean the trial’s over?” 
“Such as it was. You were 
guilty. All that was needed was a 
verdict. It’s the three penalties, of 



KINGSLAYER 



105 



course. The first one will begin 
immediately I leave. You get no 
food for five hours.” 

“You mean that really is the 
same for me as for them?” 

“Yes. They like to regard them- 
selves as a very just race, and all 
aliens on Spurc are subject to ex- 
actly the same law and exactly 
the same penalties as a native. 
The second penalty is three in 
one. It’s the Three Unwishes.” 
“The which?” 

“That’s a literal translation. The 
Three Opposites-of-Wishes. The 
third penalty is—” 

“Hold on. Let’s stick to the 
Three Unwishes. What are they?” 
“They’ll find out the three 
things you most desire, reverse 
them and do them.” 

“How would they learn things 
like that about me?” 

“By asking you, by truth drugs 
and other methods, they’ll find out 
the three things you want most. 
You won’t be able to stop them. 
Then they do the opposite.” 

He shrugged. “There are cer- 
tain semantic difficulties, but I’m 
afraid a prisoner isn’t allowed to 
argue his case. You have to ac- 
cept their version of what’s op- 
posite. Suppose, for example, you 
wanted to be able to play Rach- 
maninoff’s Second Piano Concerto. 
Some people might say that the 
opposite was not being able to 
play Rachmaninoff’s Second Piano 
Concerto and that consequently 



they wouldn’t have to do anything 
about it. I’m afraid that in such 
a case, however, the Spurcans 
would probably take the view that 
to prevent you ever being able to 
play Rachmaninoff’s Second Piano 
Concerto, they’d have to break 
your fingers or cut off your hands.” 
Allan shuddered. 

“It may not be so bad,” said 
Carruthers encouragingly. “I had 
to undergo the Three Unwishes 
once and nothing happened to me. 
Depends if you can get them to 
accept comparatively harmless de- 
sires or not. Obviously if what you 
most want is to live forever, the 
Three Unwishes could be pretty 
serious.” 

“I thought you said I wouldn’t 
be able to stop them finding out 
the things I most want.” 

“You won’t, but you might be 
able to finagle a little, knowing 
what’s going to happen. I did.” 
“When does this start?” 

“After your five hours’ starva- 
tion are over. They’ll find out your 
three main desires tonight and be- 
gin to punish you tomorrow.” 
Tomorrow. That meant that if 
Dawn Clifford succeeded in help- 
ing him to escape, he had nothing 
to worry about. 

“They won’t take me away from 
here?” 

“Certainly not.” Carruthers’ gaze 
became quite keen. “Has anything 
happened since I saw you last?” 
“What could happen?” 



106

107 




“There might have been some 
spurious attempt to rescue you, 
for example. Probably by a girl of 
about your own age or a little 
less.” 

Allan stared at him in open dis- 
like. 

“I wanted to tell you,” said Car- 
ruthers virtuously, “but you 
wouldn’t let me. Traditions count 
for a lot on Spurc. Just as we see 
to it that people are defended in 
court whether they deserve it or 
not, Spurcans have attempts to es- 
cape. It doesn’t seem decent to 
them that while a man is awaiting 
sentence, his friends and relatives, 
and particularly his wife or girl 
friend, shouldn’t make any at- 
tempt to have him released. So 
they see to it that jailbreak at- 
tempts are made.” 

“But in the case of a human, 
how could they get another hu- 
man to cooperate?” 

“Easily enough. For money. If 
there was any such attempt — and 
I can’t imagine there not being one 
— I think I can guess who you saw. 
Dawn Clifford.” 

Allan felt himself growing hot 
under the collar. He didn’t neces- 
sarily trust Carruthers and he had 
no intention of betraying anything 
to him. Nevertheless, he couldn’t 
help saying bitterly: “How could 
any human collaborate with those 
inhuman little balloons to torture 
another human?” 

“If you mean how could Dawn 



do it. I’ll tell you. She’s an actress. 
Came here two years ago with a 
touring company. Fell foul of 
Spurcan law and isn’t allowed to 
leave. Q.E.D.” 

“Why does any human ever 
come here?” Allan exploded. 

“I don’t know. Why did you 
come here?” Carruthers inquired 
politely. 

r T , HAT night the doctors, psy- 
chologists and scientists ar- 
rived at the Simber suite. None of 
them could speak English except 
the interpreter, whose job was 
simply to interpret anything the 
Spurcans wanted translated, not 
to enable Allan to say all he felt 
inclined to say. 

They fastened plates against his 
skin, measured his blood pressure, 
checked his brain patterns. Tech- 
nologically, they were several hun- 
dred years out of date, but that 
merely meant the methods were 
crude, not the results. Allan could 
be sure that since they were deal- 
ing with an alien, comparatively 
unfamiliar life-form, they had con- 
sulted the official intergalactic or- 
ganism standards and consequent- 
ly would be able to interpret his 
reactions only a little less accurate- 
ly than human psychologists. 

The first thing they established 
was that he particularly wanted 
to get out of Spurc. They didn’t 
say anything, or at least the inter- 
preter didn’t translate anything. 



108 



GALAXY 



But it needed very little imagina- 
tion to see that that would mean 
he was to be kept a prisoner for 
life on Spurc. 

Now Allan remembered what 
Carruthers had said about Dawn 
Clifford. She had fallen foul of 
Spurcan law too, had been sen- 
tenced to starvation and the Three 
Unwishes — and naturally one of 
the things she most wanted had 
been to get away from Spurc. 

It must be a not uncommon cir- 
cumstance among visitors to Spurc 
who happened to get into legal 
trouble. 

The second thing Allan desired 
was the most beautiful girl in the 
Galaxy. The third was a million 
dollars. 

Three simple, straightforward 
desires. He wondered what they 
would make of the last two. Make 
him a present of the ugliest woman 
in the Galaxy? Claim that he 
owed them a million dollars? 

The interpreter was speaking. 
Would he accept Dawn Clifford as 
the most beautiful girl in the 
Galaxy? 

His thoughts raced. They knew 
he knew her. Therefore Carruthers 
was right — she had been hired to 
act a part. There had never been 
any real prospect of escape. The 
Spurcans had fixed the whole thing. 

He felt sick. How could a girl 
like that do a thing like that? 

The interpreter repeated his 
question. Would he accept Dawn 



Clifford as the most beautiful girl 
in the Galaxy? 

Obviously it was in his best in- 
terests to say no. Then they’d 
have to find somebody else, some- 
body he would accept. There 
couldn’t be many human girls in 
Spurc, and it would be a long 
time before any girl elsewhere 
could be persuaded to work for 
them in whatever way they 
planned. Maybe he could stall 
them for years over this. But what 
would he gain by stalling? 

In a sudden spurt of impatience, 
he said, “Yes.” Let them get on 
with it. Whatever happened, the 
sooner the better. 

After that, they left him. And 
that night Dawn Clifford didn’t 
come. 

He climbed into the fountain 
into which she had disappeared, 
and found all the gratings as solid- 
ly latched as the back and side 
doors of the palace. 

TVTEXT day he had an official 

^ visit, not from Carruthers this 
time but from Verin, the public 
prosecutor. He looked exactly like 
all Spurcans except that he had 
the brownness of extreme age. 
There were about thirty members 
of the Guard with him to protect 
him against the dangerous alien 
creature who had murdered King 
Phunk. 

The Spurcans arranged them- 
selves in V formation, with Verin 



K I NGSLAYER 



109 



at the apex of the V, farthest from 
Allan. Then he passed sentence 
in a musical whistle, and the in- 
terpreter interpreted. 

“Allan Simber, human, regicide, 
this is your punishment. Having 
already been starved near to 
death—” 

“Near death?” Allan exclaimed. 

The interpreter wasn’t allowed 
to do anything but interpret “Hav- 
ing already been starved near to 
death-” 

“When?” Allan asked. He didn’t 
remember any five-hour fasting 
period. Then he realized that he’d 
slept most of the previous after- 
noon. They must have counted 
that. Well, if that was typical of 
the way they were going to punish 
him for his terrible crime, it was 
a good thing he hadn’t lost any 
sleep worrying about it. 

“Okay,” he said. “I follow you. 
Go ahead.” 

“Having already been starved 
near to death,” the interpreter con- 
tinued, “you are now sentenced to 
the following Unwishes: One, you 
will remain on this world forever. 
Two, you will spend this night 
with the most beautiful girl in the 
Galaxy and will not possess her. 
Three, you will not be given a 
million dollars.” 

A LLAN burst out laughing. He 
didn’t want to live the rest of 
his life on Spurc. But though they’d 
been able to keep Dawn Clifford a 



prisoner for a couple of years, the y"d 
find it harder to watch over a com- 
petent space pilot. 

He had no particular objection 
to spending a night with Dawn 
Clifford, even if that was all he 
was allowed to do. And the idea 
of not being given a million dol- 
lars didn’t terrify him. It didn’t 
even disappoint him. He hadn’t 
ever counted on getting those mil- 
lion dollars. 

“The third penalty,” said the in- 
terpreter, “is death according to 
the manner of the crime.” 

Allan stopped laughing. “Huh?” 
he said. 

“The third penalty is death ac- 
cording to the manner of the 
crime,” the interpreter repeated 
obediently. 

“Wait a minute,” said Allan. 
“What’s this all about?” 

The Spurcans turned and 
trooped out, Verin in the lead now. 

This time, when he’d have liked 
Carruthers to come and explain 
things to him, Carruthers didn’t 
come. 

The first penalty he hadn’t even 
noticed. The second, the Three 
Unwishes, didn’t seem to amount 
to anything except that he was 
never to leave Spurc — and he had 
his own ideas about that. 

But a sentence of death — that 
was no joke. Semantic differences 
didn’t stretch far enough to make 
it anything else but capital pun- 
ishment.

’ I ^ HAT night Dawn came to 
-*• him. She entered wearing a 
long black cloak and stood across 
the room from him. No Spurcans 
came with her. 

“I hope you’re pleased with 
yourself,” said Allan bitterly. 

She didn’t give the impression 
of acting a part now. “I’m sorry,” 
she said, not sounding very sorry, 
“but I had no choice. Just as I 
have no choice now. You have my 
sympathy, but I have much more 
sympathy for myself. Frankly, I’d 
sacrifice you without uncurling a 
hair if I could get off this world.” 

He liked her better for that. 
When people were honest, at least 
you knew how you stood with 
them. 

He looked around. “Where are 
the Spurcans?” 

She shrugged indifferently. “Be- 
hind the walls. You’ve been under 
closer watch than you knew all 
the time you’ve been here.” 

“And what happens now?” 

“Nothing unless you touch me.” 

“Then what?” 

“I don’t know. But something 
will. You’ll have to try it to find 
out.” 

“I will. Later. Mean to say we 
just stay here all night, and as 
long as I don’t touch you, nothing 
happens? That it?” 

She shrugged again. “I guess so.” 
He saw now that for all her love- 
ly face and figure, she was a beau- 
tiful monomaniac with one ambi- 



tion, one interest in life — to get 
away from Spurc. She really would 
sacrifice him or anybody or any- 
thing to do so. 

“I like the Spurcans,” Allan ob- 
served. “They really are fair, ac- 
cording to their lights. Carruthers 
gave me the idea they’d be pretty 
tough in their interpretation of 
the three Unwishes, but they seem 
to have been honest enough. 
They-” 

“Don’t talk to me about them!” 
said Dawn with suppressed pas- 
sion. 

“Why not? We’re on their 
world.” 

“I hate them! I loathe them! My 
skin crawls when I’m near them!” 

“Why, what have they done?” 

“They didn’t have to do any- 
thing! I just hate them!” 

She shuddered, and Allan saw 
with interest that she could barely 
control her physical loathing of 
the Spurcans. It must be like 
some people’s dread of spiders, or 
rats, or snakes. 

TTE began to feel sorry for her 
in his turn, imagining what 
it must be like to be imprisoned 
on Spurc with so strong an aver- 
sion to the bulbous little Spurcans. 

“Why did you come here then?” 
he asked. 

“How could I know? I’d never 
seen any of them on Earth. Look, 
I said let’s not talk about them.” 

“Tell me one thing. After the 



KINGSLAYER 



111 




Three Unwishes, they say I’m to 
die according to the manner of 
my crime. What does that mean?” 
“I don’t know. For Pete’s sake, 
don’t get the idea I’m in their con- 
fidence. I just do what I’m told. 
All I want is to get back to Earth.” 
“And if you work for them long 
enough, they let you go — is that 
it?” 



“The hell it is! When they sen- 
tence you to stay here forever, 
they mean it. I do as I’m told be- 
cause I’ve got to, that’s all. I don’t 
get anything out of it but my food 
and shelter. Now shut up about 
the Spurcans, will you? Talk 
about Earth if you must talk.” 
With a casual movement, she 
undid the strings about her throat. 



112 



GALAXY 





The black cloak fell from her. 

“Do you have to do that?" Allan 
exclaimed. 

She nodded composedly. “Sure. 
You’re supposed to be driven mad 
with desire, rush to embrace me, 
and thep they do whatever it is 
they’re going to do.” 

She started to walk about the 
room with slow, voluptuous steps. 



“Do you have to do that too?” 
Allan asked in a strangled voice. 

“Of course. You don’t have to 
look.” 

Allan bore it for a few seconds. 
Then he stood up. “I’m going to 
find out,” he said. “Do you mind?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. She 
was always doing that. “Doesn’t 
make any difference whether I 



Kl NGSLAYER 



113 



mind or not. I hope they remem- 
ber it’s you who’s supposed to be 
getting punished, not me.” 

Allan leaped at her and took her 
slight but curvy body in his arms. 
Instantly everything went black. 

When he came to, he was on 
one couch and Dawn was on an- 
other, about two feet away, so that 
when he opened his eyes he was 
staring at her. 

She opened her eyes a few sec- 
onds after he did, looked around 
and shuddered. 

“If you have no objections,” she 
said, “I’d rather you didn’t do that 
again. After they knocked us out 
with the beam, they must have 
come in and lifted us here. I don’t 
mind you touching me, but the 
Spurcans . .” She shivered. “Let’s 
just accept the situation, shall we?” 

“Okay,” Allan sighed. “It’s ac- 
cepted.” 

They weren’t allowed to sleep. 
Bells rang when their heads 
drooped, and once, to Dawn’s vis- 
ible horror, a dozen Spurcans came 
in to shake her awake. She showed 
no desire to sleep after that. 

They spent the night talking 
about Earth. 

A S he took off, Allan was rea- 
sonably happy. If he had to 
die, he’d rather have it this way 
than any other. 

The old, patched ship they had 
given him in place of his own han- 
dled like a tranquilized cow, but 



nevertheless he’d have enough con- 
trol when the time came to make 
the end as neat and instantaneous 
as anyone could wish. 

The Spurcans had told him 
that he had enough fuel to get into 
space, no more. They hadn’t told 
him what was wrong, how they 
had ensured that when the old 
ship fell back into Spurc’s atmos- 
phere, he wouldn’t be able to land 
her. It wasn’t difficult to guess, 
however. The braking fins would 
go, same as before. 

That was what they’d meant by 
“according to the manner of the 
crime.” 

He hadn’t seen either Carruthers 
or Dawn Clifford again. He had 
no particular desire to see them. 
It was more than possible that on 
any other planet, even in space, 
Dawn Clifford might be worth 
knowing. On Spurc, however, she 
was nothing but a cold, beautiful 
phonograph record which played 
nothing except : Let me away from 
here! God, how I hate them! 

He’d been glad to see the last of 
the palace, glad to get out into the 
city of Pluc, where at least there 
were sounds, happiest of all to get 
into a ship — even this antiquated 
derelict. 

If he could manage it, he pro- 
posed to blow up right in the mid- 
dle of the palace — to spit his life, 
at least symbolically, in the Spur- 
cans’ face. The annoying thing 
was that he didn’t think they 



114 



GALAXY 



would mind particularly. They 
were more concerned that their 
version of justice should be done 
than over any damage he might 
succeed in doing. 

The ship climbed. The drive 
had been set so that he could not 
cut it in less than ten minutes. 
Now, however, he found he could 
control it. He reached out to cut 
the drive, wanting to preserve as 
much fuel as he could. 

“Don’t,” said a voice behind 
him. 

He turned and saw Carruthers 
and Dawn Clifford. Dawn was 
smiling, happy. He hardly recog- 
nized her. 

“Let it rip, old boy,” said Car- 
ruthers. “I don’t know how good a 
pilot you are, but if you’re good 
enough, you may be able to get us 
to somewhere civilized.” 

“But . 

“We took care of the fuel. 
There’s plenty. Also we patched 
up the damage they’d done before 
giving you this ship. Not very well, 
perhaps, but well enough to give 
you a chance.” 

Dawn was still smiling at him. 
“Hello,” she said, offering her hand. 
“I’m Dawn Clifford.” 

“I know,” he said, a little dazed. 
She looked like another person, 
with clothes on, and he found he 
liked this one better. She was 
bubbling over with happiness now, 
a warm, vital creature he had 
never seen before. 



“No, you don’t know me,” she 
said. “We never met, did we?” 

“I guess you’re right at that,” 
confessed Allan. “Pleased to meet 
you. And to my surprise, I mean 
it.” 

She laughed. “I’ll go make some 
coffee,” she said. “Spurcan coffee, 
I’m afraid. I don’t mind any more. 
Ohj it’s wonderful to be clear of 
that place!” 

W HEN she went out, Allan 
turned to Carruthers. “What 
is all this? Are you telling me this 
ship is all right?” 

“Anything but, my dear fellow,” 
said Carruthers genially, “but 
there’s no need to crash on Spurc. 
I knew the Spurcans wouldn’t 
guard this ship any more than 
they guarded your own. Why 
should anyone tamper with a ship 
that’s already been damaged so 
that it must blow up?” 

“I guess I’ve a lot to thank you 
for,” said Allan. “And if it can be 
done, I’ll get you both away safely. 
But what are you doing here, Car- 
ruthers? I know how much Dawn 
wanted to get away, but how about 
you?” 

“I told you,” Carruthers replied, 
“that I’d fallen foul of the Three 
Unwishes as well as you. Sooner 
or later, every visitor does. And 
naturally one of the wishes is al- 
ways to get away from Spurc.” 

“I see,” said Allan. “This was 
the only way we could all get 



KINGSLAYER 



115 



away. You were pretty smart, Car- 
ruthers.” 

Carrurthers nodded. “I was,” he 
agreed. 

“When did you get this idea?” 

“Not long before you took the 
King up,” said Carruthers blandly. 

OR a moment, Allan didn’t 
understand. Then anger spread 
through him as he realized what 
Carruthers meant. 

“So you - ” 

“Well, after all, I’ve been a 
prisoner on Spurc for ten years. I 
didn’t come here to be ambassa- 
dor.. I took the job because I 
had to eat. Every time a ship 
has blasted off, they’ve searched 
her to make sure that people like 
Dawn and me haven’t managed to 
stow away. It seemed to me the 
only ship that wouldn’t be searched 
was a ship that was meant to 
crash. So I had to fix myself up 
with a pilot and a ship that was 
meant to crash. That meant . 
but I won’t insult your intelligence 
by explaining the obvious.” 

“You sabotaged my ship so the 
King would be killed?” 

“Of course. I knew you’d make 
some sort of landing and would 
probably get out unhurt. But these 
puffy little Spurcans wouldn’t have 
a chance in a rough landing. With 
your affidavit and a little finagling 
in court by me, that meant the 
three penalties for you culminat- 



ing in this. I had to get Miss Clif- 
ford’s cooperation, but if you want 
to whitewash her, it’s easy enough 
— I didn’t tell her about the plan 
until after King Phunk was dead. 
By that time, there was nothing 
for her to do but play along with 
me.” 

Allan found himself relieved 
that Dawn hadn’t been a party to 
the plan from the beginning. But 
his rage against Carruthers didn’t 
lessen. Carruthers had murdered 
poor little King Phunk and all his 
retinue and landed Allan in deadly 
trouble just to get himself off 
Spurc. And now he was gleefully 
proud of himself. 

“I feel like smashing this ship 
on the nearest lump of rock,” Allan 
said viciously. 

“But you won’t,” said Car- 
ruthers, unperturbed. “Not with 
yourself and Miss Clifford aboard. 
Particularly Miss Clifford. Her 
presence makes a difference, 
doesn’t it?” 

“Yes,” Allan admitted. “I can’t 
wring your neck without upsetting 
and maybe alienating her. Was 
that why you fitted her into your 
plan?” 

Carruthers looked hurt. “Natu- 
rally,” he said. “You don’t suppose 
I’d leave a thing like that to 
chance, do you?” 

He was shocked, horrified and 
still more hurt when Allan hit him.

lish. Penny wasn’t really in love 
with him; she only thought she 
was, after pretending she was, to 
make David jealous, which she 
certainly did. But after the count 
gently explained to her, she and 
David made up just in time for the 
Spring Prom, which made the dis- 
tant observer very happy. 

At least he thought it did. “What 
is happy?” he often asked himself. 
Maybe just pretend. You never 
really loved me Rick it was just 
a pretense wasn’t it? Like the dis- 
tant observer thinking of himself 
as “him” when, really, he knew 
now — had known long — he was 
only an “it” It’s about time we 
faced up to reality, Alison. Yes. It 
was about time. We can’t go on 
like this. No, certainly not. It was 
time. 

In the beginning, there was no 
time. There was sight— here dark, 
there bright. He did not know 
then, of course — and how long had 
“then” lasted? Memory did not 
tell that the bright was stars. And 
there was sound — whispering, 
crackling, shrilling. What do you 
mean, Professor, when you say 
that outer space is not a place of 
silence? And then (he knew now 
that this “then” was about fifty 
years ago) there had begun a new 
kind of sound. Not steady, but in- 
terrupted, and interrupted accord- 
ing to patterns. Awareness had 
stirred, gradually, and wonder. He 
knew later that this was “wireless.” 



CQ, CQ, CQ . SOS, SOS, 
SOS . 

And then the other kinds of 
sounds, oh, very different. These 
were voices. This was “radio.” And 
music. It was too different; the 
distant observer knew distress 
without even knowing that it was 
distress. But he grew used to it — 
that is, distress ceased: but not 
wonder. Urgency came with the 
voices. What? What? He groped 
for meaning, not even knowing 
what meaning was. 

"PRESENTLY there was another 
kind of sight, not just the dark 
and the stars any longer, but pic- 
tures — flickering, fading, dancing, 
clear, pictures upon pictures. Grad- 
ually he learned selectivity — how 
to concentrate upon one, how to 
not-see, not-hear the others. Still 
later: how to see and hear all with- 
out confusion. How to match sound 
and sight. That things had names. 
What people were, who made the 
voices and the music. What mean- 
ing was. 

About himself, he learned noth- 
ing directly. For a while, he had 
tried to speak to them, but it was 
apparent that nothing of him 
reached Earth. He had learned 
Earth, yes. And knew what this 
place was, where he was. An as- 
teroid. How had he come to be 
there? This was in space. There 
were spaceships — he saw the 
scenes on television. Meteors were 



LOVE CALLED THIS THING 



119 




120 



GALAXY 



dangerous to spaceships. He knew 
meteors. Sometimes spaceships 
crashed. He scanned all his little 
world, but there was no spaceship, 
crashed or otherwise. 

You’ve got to help me — I don’t 
know who I am! But that was 
more easy, oh, so much more so — 
that one was a man, and there 
were many men. The sponsors (in 
this case, Muls, the creamy-smooth 
deodorant) were men, too. Every- 
body was very kind to this man. 
He had amnesia. What was odor? 
This the observer could not un- 
stand. But to have no memory, 
this he understood very well. This 
he shared with men. 

Gradually he had come to share 
many things with men. They spoke 
different languages, but the one 
which came with the first pictures 
was English. English from Amer- 
ica. Later on, there was English 
from England, there was French, 
Russian, Spanish, Japanese — but 
American was first and best. So 
much more interesting than the 
Red Army and the hydroelectric 
dams, these stories of real life. Of 
love and sadness and of happiness. 

Kid, there ain’t no problem in 
all this world you can’t lick if you 
really try. Very well, the observer 
would try. You never know what 
you can do till you try. His first 
attempt at taking shape wasn’t 
good. It didn’t look much like a 
man. So he tried again and again. 
Each time he grew better at it. 

LOVE CALLED THIS THING 



It was true, what the people said. 
It was all true, every word and 
picture of it. There ain’t no prob- 
lem— 

And so when it came time for 
his favorite Wednesday evening 
program, the distant observer was 
ready. Summoning all his effort, 
husbanding all his energy, he 
passed along the wave length as a 
man walks down a street. There 
was a slight jar, a click. He 
realized that he could never undo 
what had just been done. There 
was a new body now, a new 
metabolism. The past is dead, 
David. We have to live lor the 
future. 

“And what is your name — my, 
you got up here but quick!” bur- 
bled Keith Kane, the M.C. of Cash 
or Credit. “I’ve never known a 
volunteer from our happy studio 
audience to manage it quite so 
suddenly. This is just the warm- 
up, sir, so you needn’t be nervous. 
Not that you need the reassur- 
ance — cool as a cucumber, isn’t 
he, folks? Say, did you folks ever 
hear the story about the little Sun- 
day School boy who said that King 
Solomon had three hundred wives 
and six hundred cucumbers? Wow! 
I’m really naughty! You other 
folks who volunteered just take 
seats right there—” 

HPHE first lady volunteer was 
old and pretty. Well, maybe 
not so old. But maybe like Mary 

121 



Clay who realized that she was 
too old for young David Webster 
and after she cried she accepted 
the fact and sent him back to 
Madge Barkley whom he really 
loved all the while, only they had 
this silly quarrel. 

The lady smiled at him. He 
smiled back. I — feel — GREAT! 

“—So that’s the way the rules 
work, and now, folks, in just five 
seconds we’ll be on the air! Five- 
four — three — two — one — Good 
evening, all you lovely people out 
there in TV Land! This is Keith 
Kane, bringing you the great — 
the greater — the GREATEST 
quiz program ever: Cash or 

Credit?” 

Now he felt his heart beating 
very fast. So that was what it 
was like! And now he knew what 
was odor. But the lovely lady vol- 
unteer next to him smelled, yes, 
that was sweet. But if it was 
Muls or Van Art Number Three, 
this he would learn later. 

“—just rinse and dry, folks, that’s 
all there is to it: Clear-o, the all- 
purpose vegetable detergent. And 
now whom have we here? What is 
your name, sir?” 

Here it was. And how terrible if 
he should break down and press 
his hands to his head and sob, 
“I — I — don’t — know!” But he did 
know; he had it all ready. “David. 
My name is David Taylor.” All 
the ones named David were good. 
Oh, they had their troubles, but in 



the end everyone loved them. And 
see: nice Keith Kane beaming. 
The lady, too. 

“Well, David, what’ll it be? 
Cash— or— Credit? You know the 
rules: If you pick Cash, we spin 
this little wheel. If it comes up 
with a number, you go on to an- 
swer — if you can, hah-ha— a ques- 
tion worth however many thousand 
dollars follow that number. If it 
comes up blank — you’re out. 
Whereas, if you pick Credit, you 
take your place among the volun- 
teers and if any contestant makes 
a boo-boo, why, you step into his 
shoes and he is out. Soooo— ?” 

“Take the cash and let the credit 
go,” said David. 

Grinning from lobe to lobe, 
Keith Kane asked the same ques- 
tions of the lady, whose name was 
Mrs. Conar, Mrs. Ethel-Mae 
Conar, a widow; and received the 
same answer. The audience ap- 
plauded, the wheel was spun, and 
it came up 10. 

“Ten-thousand - DOLLARS!” 
screamed Keith Kane. “That’s 
what your first question is worth 
and here it is: What former Presi- 
dent of the United States is asso- 
ciated with this tune, and what is 
the name of the tune, which refers 
to his State? Remember, you have 
thirty seconds to think it over . .” 

David and Mrs. Conar won two 
hundred and eighty-five thousand 
dollars in cash before the program 
was over, as well as a year’s sup-

ply of Clear-o, and fifty shares of 
stock in a mink ranch; and the 
band played “The Stars and 
Stripes Forever” as Keith Kane 
counted out the money. Mrs. 
Conar had kissed him and kissed 
David and was now clasping his 
hands and sobbing that she didn't 
believe it. 

“Oh, it’s true,” David assured 
her. “It’s all true; that’s the funny 
part of it.” (David Mackay said 
that, in Matinee, when he admitted 
his wife was an alcoholic.) Sight 
and sound and touch (kissing was 
pleasant; no wonder it was so 
much done) and smell and — and 
—what was the other? Taste. Keith 
Kane bawled at him the question 
of what he was going to do with 
all his money. David deliberated. 
What was it that Clem Clooten, on 
Saddle-Galled, had said, the time 
he broke the faro bank in Dogie 
City? Taste . yes: “Fm goin’ 
out ’n buy m’self a cup o’ java . .” 
The audience went wild. 

J AVA tasted. Taste was as ex- 
citing as the other four sensa- 
tions. And sitting next to him on 
the counter-stool was Mrs. Ethel- 
Mae Conar, gazing at his distin- 
guished profile. It was clean-cut; 
all Davids were clean-cut. He 
gazed down at her. He was tall, of 
course. 

He searched for the right words. 
It turned out to be singular. “Hap- 
py?” he asked. 

LOVE CALLED THIS THING 



She sighed, nodded. Then — 
“You’re a rather strange young 
man,” she said. “Do you know 
that?” 

Certainly he knew it. 

He leaned closer. “This is big- 
ger than both of us,” he said hus- 
kily. “Let me take you away from 
all this . .” 

“I certainly will,” she said brisk- 
ly, “right over to my place in the 
Surrey-Regis on Park Avenue—” 
That meant she was unhappy 
despite her money! — “where we 
can have a decent cup of coffee.” 
The counterman scowled at the 
bill David offered him. “Whatsis? 
Play-money? A five-hunnerd-dolla 
bill? Whuddya, wise guy?” 

David arose slowly, buttoning 
his jacket, and leaned over. “If 
you’re looking for trouble, bud- 
dy . .” he said. But the guy 
chickened out. Anyway, Ethel-Mae 
had some change in her purse. 
“Taxi!” David called happily. He 
helped her in, sank back in the 
seat, and when the driver asked 
Where To, David said crisply, 
“Follow that cab!” 

The driver (Herman Bogancz, 
the license read) half-turned, half- 
growled. Ethel-Mae laughed. “Oh, 
if you aren’t — never mind, driver: 
the Surry-Regis, on Park near—” 
But H. Bogancz muttered that he 
knew where the place was. 

David gazed out the window ex- 
citedly. Everywhere, men and 
lights and women and automo- 

123 



biles. “Little old New York,” he 
murmured. 

Suddenly she yelped, dug her 
fingers into his arm. 

“Darling!” he exclaimed. “Are 
you all right? Is anything wrong?” 
“No,” she said. “Oh, no-” 
“Something must be wrong,” he 
insisted. “You can tell me, dear. 
I trust you. No matter what you’ve 
done—” 

“What I’ve done?” she screamed. 
“I’ve just won a half-share in 
$285,000 is what—” 

He seized her, turned her fac- 
ing him. “Are you out of your 
mind?” he gritted. And then, mem- 
ory returning, he released her. 
“Yeah . Gee . that’s right. 
Yeah . how about that? Do you 
know what this means? Ethel-Mae, 
we’re rich! we’re rich!” 

The driver twisted his chin 
slightly to the right. “Do y’ mind, 
mister? Not so loud with the deci- 
bels. I gotta near condition.” 
David said, shocked, “If there’s 
anything I can do — anything at 
all — if you need money — we’ll 
get the best surgeon there is—” 
Herman Bogancz shrugged. “My 
cousin Sidney is the best surgeon 
there is, and he says an operation 
wouldn’t help.” 

“Then,” said David, “there’s 
nothing more that any of us can 
do — except wait — and pray—” 
“—and wash it out three times a 
day with a boric acid solution,” 
said Herman Bogancz. 



T\AVID didn’t quite understand 
* ^ why Mrs. Coran made him 
apply for a room at the Surrey- 
Regis by himself while she went 
up to her room through the side 
entrance. In fact, he didn’t under- 
stand at all. The clerk looked at 
him rather oddly when he ex- 
plained this to him and asked for 
a room near hers. He looked even 
odder when he saw the $500 bill. 
Once again David buttoned his 
jacket (it had been necessary to 
unbutton it first) and leaned over. 
“I hope,” he said, “that I’m not go- 
ing to have any trouble with you.” 
“Oh, dear me, no,” said the 
clerk. “Not at all . my good- 
ness, Mr. Taylor, but you really 
are tall, aren’t you? Suite 516. 
Mrs. Coran’s is Suite 521 — that’s 
the best I can do right just this 
very minute, and—” 

Another gentleman materialized 
at David’s elbow. “Good evening, 
sir,” he said suavely. “I am Mr. 
Feltz, the manager. Is everything 
all right?” 

“The boy’s not to blame,” David 
said, gesturing toward the clerk. 
“Society is to blame— we’re all to 
blame. It’s these crazy, mixed-up 
times we live in.” 

Behind David’s back, the clerk 
spread open the $500 bill for Mr. 
Feltz’s inspection. 

“How right you are, sir,” said 
Mr. Feltz. 

“About the gentleman’s — Mr. 
Taylor’s change, Mr. Feltz—?” 



124 



GALAXY 



David turned, put his hand on 
the clerk’s shoulder. The man 
flushed, sucked in his lower lip. 
“That’s for you, sonny. There is 
no such thing as a bad boy. I never 
met a man I didn’t like.” 

‘‘Front!” said the clerk, his voice 
tremulous. 

Mr. Feltz handed the keys to 
516 to the bellboy himself, urged 
Mr. Taylor to make his wants 
known immediately. As David 
walked toward the elevator, the 
manager turned to his subordi- 
nate. “The Rich,” he said simply. 
The clerk nodded solemnly. “We 
know their ways,” said Mr. Feltz. 
“Eh? Well, that’s very generous of 
you, Robert— but, no, sixty-forty 
is good enough. He seems to have 
taken a liking to you. Send up 
flowers, the morning papers, a split 
of champagne. And include my 
card, Robert.” 

As soon as the bellboy had gone 
(rather like a satisfied customer on 
his way out of a high-class opium 
den, with a $500 bill clutched in 
his hot hand), David went down 
the corridor and knocked on the 
door of Suite 521. “Ethel-Mae?” 
he asked, his face close to the 
door. “Dearest? This is David. 
Please open. I can explain every- 
thing.” 

And, sure enough, her words as 
she opened the door and fell into 
his arms were, “There is nothing 
to explain!” Then she said, “It’s 
just that you’re so sweet — and 

LOVE CALLED THIS THING 



naive. But that nasty little nance 
down at the desk wouldn’t under- 
stand.” 

Since David didn’t understand 
either, he made no comment, but 
covered her face with kisses. “Dar- 
ling, I love you,” he said. “Please 
believe me.” And she said, But she 
did — she did. “Do you know what 
it’s like to be alone — always alone 
— never to know love? Do you? 
Do you? No. Of course you 
don’t-” 

Her answer was exactly correct. 
“Hush, darling,” she said. “Every- 
thing’s going to be all right.” He 
sighed, kissed her again. Then— 

“Ethel-Mae? Ethel-Mae? Mrs. 
Coran? What—? Why are you—” 
But she didn’t seem to hear him. 
Nothing he had ever heard on 
radio or seen on television pre- 
pared him for what was happening 
now. But — he decided after a 
moment or so — what was happen- 
ing now was — though strange — 
not unpleasant. “This is wrong,” 
he groaned happily. “It’s all wrong. 
But I — I don’t care. Do you hear, 
I don’t care!” 

T T was two in the morning before 
* he stumbled back to his own 
room, and bed. At half-past two, 
he was awakened by the bellboy’s 
father and mother (smuggled up 
on the service elevator) who had 
come all the way from Mulberry 
Street to kiss his hands. At three, 
he was half-awakened by a scratch- 

125 



ing noise at his door. After a few 
minutes, he got up and — after 
approaching it as cautiously as the 
Sheriff of Hangtown on the pro- 
gram of the same name — threw it 
suddenly open. 

A pretty girl with her red hair 
in a pony-tail uttered a little 
scream. Pencil and notebook fell to 
the floor. “Why — you — you’re 
only a child!” he said, in a hushed 
voice. 

“Mr. T-Taylor — ” she began 
very nervously. “I saw you at the 
studio and I fol— followed you—” 
she gulped — “over here. But it 
took till now for me to get up 
nerve—” 

“Why, you’re frightened,” he 
said, looking down at her. “Don’t 
be frightened. Y ou don’t ever have 
to be frightened of me. Come in,” 
he urged. “Please come in.” 

She picked up her notebook and 
followed him in obediently. Then, 
taking the seat he gestured to, she 
said, “And I’m not such a child, 
either. I’m a senior at Barnard. 
Journalism major. And I want a 
story from you, Mr. Taylor, be- 
fore all the other reporters get 
here. Please, Mr. Taylor, please.” 
He looked at her admiringly. 
“That took guts,” he said. “Where 
I come from, the men get sepa- 
rated from the boys mighty young. 
But— don’t call me ‘Mr. Taylor’— 
Mr. Taylor has gray hair at the 
temples. Call me ‘David’.” 

She called him David. And she 



told him that her name was 
Pamela Novack. And he said that 
Pamela was a lovely name. She 
told him that she’d hated it as a 
child, but that lately — in fact, 
just this very minute — she’d got- 
ten to like it a whole lot more. And 
they laughed. They laughed a 
whole lot. 

Before they knew it, it was get- 
ting light. 

“Oh, golly,” Pamela sighed. “Oh, 
gee, have I got a story! In a way, 
it’s so sad, you having such an 
unhappy childhood, I mean; your 
mother dying from the brain tumor 
and your father being an alco- 
holic—” 

He said that was all in the past. 
He said they had to start looking 
toward the future. She nodded so- 
berly. Then she stretched and said 
she was hungry. 

“Hey, how about that!” David 
laughed, catching sight of his face 
in the mirror. It was a nice face. 
He had done well in making it; 
it looked like all the Davids he 
had ever seen. “You know some- 
thing? I’m hungry, too! I haven’t 
had a bite to eat since that cup 
of coffee after the show. Would 
you like to have some breakfast? 
You would? Hot diggety! . Hel- 
lo? I want Room Service, please.” 

The narcoleptic tones of the 
operator said. Not till ha’pas’six. 
And then suddenly were clear and 
alert and saying, “Oh, Mr. Tay- 
lor? Pardon me — of course, Mr. 



126 



GALAXY 



Taylor — what would you like? 
Scrambled eggs and coffee and 
toast and gallons of orange juice. 
Yes, sir, Mr. Taylor.” 

Then, suddenly, the smile was 
gone from David’s face. Anxious- 
ly, Pamela asked what the matter 
was. Scowling, he mimicked, 
“ ‘Yes, Mr. Taylor, certainly, Mr. 
Taylor’— it isn’t me they like— no- 
body likes me — it’s the money. 
Once you been in reform school, 
nobody has any use for you, the 
cops are always watching you, the 
nice girls don’t want to have any- 
thing to do with you—” 

Pamela was troubled. “Oh, you 
mustn’t say that. I — I — well, I 
think I’m a nice girl—” she blushed 
suddenly, looked down— “and I — 
like you— David.” 

TTE got up and walked back 
and forth, rubbing his left 
arm with his right hand. He swung 
around and faced her. “You!” he 
jeered. “Whadda you know? You’re 
just a fresh young kid—” 

“I am not!” she snapped. 

“A senior at Barnard! Whadda 
you know about life? You—” 

He stopped. He had been enjoy- 
ing the experience of emoting so 
much that the significance of the 
scene had escaped him. They were 
quarreling! That meant they were 
in love! Of course— Davids always 
quarreled with the girls they were 
really in love with. 

He dropped down on one knee 

LOVE CALLED THIS THING 



beside her and looked into her 
flushed, pretty face. 

“Darling,” he said brokenly, tak- 
ing her hands. “Trust me — I can’t 
explain now— but just trust me—” 
There was a sound from the 
door. They looked up. Ethel-Mae 
Conar stood there, holding her 
throat with both hands. After a 
moment, she said, “I must have 
hurt you very much, David, for 
you to have done — this — to me 
— to have forgotten. So quickly.” 
Exquisitely miserable, he 
shouted, “Leave me alone! Can’t 
you leave me alone? Can’t you un- 
derstand that it’s all over between 
us?” And then, his voice dropping, 
“Oh, Ethel-Mae, forgive me. I 
didn’t mean to say that. I didn’t 
mean it. I— I can explain.” 

Letting her hands drop resigned- 
ly, she said, “There’s nothing to 
explain, David. I understand. It 
could never have worked out. I’m 
—I’m just— too old for you, David.” 
She walked over, lifted his head 
(he had hung it, of course), placed 
her palms on his cheeks and kissed 
him gently on the forehead. Then 
she turned to Pamela and said soft- 
ly, “Be good to him, my dear. 
And give him lots of love.” She 
went out, her head high, a wist- 
ful smile on her lips, and the 
awareness that she had half of the 
$285,000, the year’s supply of 
Clear-o (the vegetable detergent), 
and the fifty shares of stock in a 
mink ranch. 



127 



There was a moment's silence. 
Then, “Gosh,” said Pamela. 
“Golly,” she said. 

David turned to her. “Darling, 
don’t cry any more,” he begged. 
“Everything’s going to be all right 
from now on.” 

“I’m not crying,” she said. Her 
eyes were shining. “The hell with 
the story and the journalism course 
and the hell with Barnard, too. 
With all your money,” she said, 
falling into his welcoming arms, 
“we can get married and start a 
family right away. Kiss me,” she 
said, “hold me tight, don’t ever 
leave me!” 

IVT R. and Mrs. David Taylor 
live in a fifteen-room house 
in Westport with two picture win- 
dows, three boxers, and three cars. 
They have two children and a 
third is on the way. They are as 
happy as any couple in Westport 
has a right to be in these crazy, 
mixed-up days. David is a highly 
successful writer of television 
scripts, with an unerring nose for 
what the public wants. It is per- 
haps unfortunate that his work 
brings him into contact with so 
many clever and attractive women. 
He is, of course, unfaithful to his 
wife with one of them at least 
twice a year (or at least once a 
year with two of them). 

There used to be a time when 
a David would never do a thing 



like this to his wife. He would 
almost do it — and then, at the 
last moment, not. But TV is 
maturing. The Davids do it all the 
time. All the damned time. 

“But how could you?” Pam Tay- 
lor weeps. “David, how could 
you?” 

And young David Taylor, his 
face twisted with anguish, cries, 
“Don’t you understand? Won’t you 
even try to understand? I’m sick! 
I need help!” 

Well. Naturally Pam is very 
sad that her husband is sick, sick, 
sick-but, after all, it’s the thing to 
be, isn’t it? And so she’s happy she 
can help him and happily she 
drives the two of them down to 
Dr. Naumbourg. David is very sad 
that he’s made his lovely wife un- 
happy, but he’s happy that he’s 
fulfilling his destiny as a David. 
Dr. Naumbourg always insists on 
both husbands and wives Going 
Into Therapy at the same time. 
Pamela’s case is a common enough 
one, merely a routine phallic envy. 
Naumbourg gets them every day. 

But in all the years since Vien- 
na, Dr. N. has never had another 
patient whose womb-fantasy takes 
the form of being a Thing on an 
asteroid. And so, while all three 
of them are very happy, Dr. Naum- 
bourg is perhaps the happiest of 
all.

mm A BSOLUTELY impos- 
/% sible,” declared Pro- 
/ % fessor Carver. 

“But I saw it,” said Fred, his 
companion and bodyguard. “Late 
last night, I saw it! They carried in 
this hunter — he had his head half 
ripped off — and they — ” 

“Wait,” Professor Carver said, 



leaning forward expectantly. 

They had left their spaceship be- 
fore dawn, in order to witness the 
sunrise ceremonies in the village of 
Loray, upon the planet of the same 
name. Sunrise ceremonies, viewed 
from a proper distance, are often 
colorful and can provide a whole 
chapter for an anthropologist’s 



THE SWEEPER OF LORAY 



129 



book; but Loray, as usual, proved a 
disappointment. 

Without fanfare, the sun rose, in 
answers to prayers made to it the 
preceding night. Slowly it hoisted 
its dull red expanse above the hori- 
zon, warming the topmost branches 
of the great rain-forest that sur- 
rounded the village. And the natives 
slept on . 

Not all the natives. Already the 
Sweeper was out, cleaning the de- 
bris between huts with his twig 
broom. He slowly shuffled along, 
human-shaped but unutterably 
alien. The Sweeper’s face was a 
stylized blank, as though nature had 
drawn there a preliminary sketch of 
intelligent life. His head was 
strangely knobbed and his skin was 
pigmented a dirty gray. 

The Sweeper sang to himself as 
he swept, in a thick, guttural voice. 
In only one way was the Sweeper 
distinguishable from his fellow Lo- 
rayans : painted across his face was 
a broad black band. This was his 
mark of station, the lowest possible 
station in that primitive society. 

“Now then,” Professor Carver 
said, after the sun had arisen with- 
out incident, “a phenomenon such 
as you describe could not exist. And 
it most especially could not exist 
upon a debased, scrubby little 
planet like this.” 

“I saw what I saw,” Fred main- 
tained. “I don’t know from impos- 
sible, Professor. I saw it. You want 
to pass it up, that’s up to you.” 



XT E leaned against the gnarly 
bole of a stabicus tree, folded 
his arms across his meager chest 
and glowered at the thatch-roofed 
village. They had been on Loray for 
nearly two months and Fred de- 
tested the village more each day. 

He was an underweight, unlovely 
young man and he wore his hair in 
a bristling crewcut which accentu- 
ated the narrowness of his brow. He 
had accompanied the professor for 
close to ten years, had journeyed 
with him to dozens of planets, and 
had seen many strange and won- 
derful things. Everything he saw, 
however, only increased his con- 
tempt for the Galaxy at large. He 
desired only to return, wealthy and 
famous, or wealthy and unknown, 
to his home in Bayonne, New 
Jersey. 

“This thing could make us rich,” 
Fred accused. “And you want to 
pass it up.” 

Professor Carver pursed his lips 
thoughtfully. Wealth was a pleasant 
thought, of course. But the professor 
didn’t want to interrupt his impor- 
tant scientific work to engage in a 
wild goose chase. He was now com- 
pleting his great book, the book 
that would fully amplify and docu- 
ment the thesis that he had put 
forth in his first paper, Color Blind- 
ness Among the Thang Peoples. 
He had expanded the thesis in his 
book, Lack of Coordination in the 
Drang Race. He had generalized 
it in his monumental Intelligence 



130 



GALAXY 



ifwU 




THE SWEEPER OF LORAY 



131 



Deficiencies Around the Galaxy, in 
which he proved conclusively that 
intelligence among Non-Terrans 
decreases arithmetically as their 
planet’s distance from Terra in- 
creases geometrically. 

Now the thesis had come to full 
flower in Carver’s most recent work, 
his unifying effort, which was to be 
titled Underlying Causes of the Im- 
plicit Inferiority of Non-Terran 
Peoples. 

“If you’re right — ” Carver said. 

“Look!” Fred cried. “They’re 
bringing in another! See for your- 
self!” 

Professor Carver hesitated. He 
was a portly, impressive, red- 
jowled man, given to slow and de- 
liberate movement. He was dressed 
in a tropical explorer’s uniform, al- 
though Loray was in a temperate 
zone. He carried a leather swagger 
stick, and strapped to his waist was 
a large revolver, a twin to the one 
Fred wore. 

“If you’re right,” Carver said 
slowly, “it would indeed be, so to 
speak, a feather in the cap.” 

“Come on!” said Fred. 

"C 1 OUR srag hunters were carry- 
ing a wounded companion to 
the medicine hut, and Carver and 
Fred fell in beside them. The hunt- 
ers were visibly exhausted; they 
must have trekked for days to bring 
their friend to the village, for the 
srag hunts ranged deep into the 
rain-forest. 



“Looks done for, huh?” Fred 
whispered. 

Professor Carver nodded. Last 
month he had photographed a srag, 
from a vantage point very high in 
a very tall, stout tree. He knew it 
for a large, ill-tempered, quick-mov- 
ing beast, with a dismaying array 
of claws, teeth and horns. It was 
also the only non-taboo meat-bear- 
ing animal on the planet. The na- 
tives had to kill srags or starve. 

But the wounded man had not 
been quick enough with spear and 
shield, and the srag had opened 
him from throat to pelvis. The 
hunter had bled copiously, even 
though the wound had been hastily 
bound with dried grasses. Merci- 
fully, he was unconscious. 

“That chap hasn’t a chance,” 
Carver remarked. “It’s a miracle 
he’s stayed alive this long. Shock 
alone, to say nothing of the depth 
and extent of the wound — ” 

“You’ll see,” Fred said. 

The village had suddenly come 
awake. Men and women, gray- 
skinned, knobby-headed, looked 
silently as the hunters marched 
toward the medicine hut. The 
Sweeper paused to watch. The vil- 
lage’s only child stood before his 
parents’ hut, and, thumb in mouth, 
stared at the procession. Deg, the 
medicine man, came out to meet the 
hunters, already wearing his cere- 
monial mask. The healing dancers 
assembled, quickly putting on their 
makeup. 



132 



GALAXY 



“Think you can fix him, Doc?” 
Fred asked. 

“One may hope,” Deg replied 
piously. 

They entered the dimly lighted 
medicine hut. The wounded Loray- 
an was laid tenderly upon a pallet 
of grasses and the dancers began 
to perform before him. Deg started 
a solemn chant. 

“That’ll never do it,” Professor 
Carver pointed out to Fred, with 
the interested air of a man watching 
a steam shovel in operation. “Too 
late for faith healing. Listen to his 
breathing. Shallower, don’t you 
think?” 

“Absolutely,” Fred said. 

Deg finished his chant and bent 
over the wounded hunter. The 
Lorayan’s breathing was labored. It 
slowed, hesitated . 

“It is time!” cried the medicine 
man. He took a small wooden tube 
cut of his pouch, uncorked it, and 
held it to the dying man’s lips. The 
hunter drank. And then — 

Carver blinked, and Fred grinned 
triumphantly. The hunter’s breath- 
ing was becoming stronger. As they 
watched, the great gash became a 
line of scar tissue, then a thin pink 
mark, then an almost invisible white 
line. 

The hunter sat up, scratched his 
head, grinned foolishly and asked 
for something to drink, preferably 
intoxicating. 

Deg declared a festival on the 
spot. 



/ ’ ARVER and Fred moved to 
^ the edge of the rain-forest for 
a conference. The professor walked 
like a man in a dream. His pendu- 
lous lower lip was thrust out and 
occasionally he shook his head. 
“How about it?” Fred asked. 

“It shouldn’t be possible,” said 
Carver dazedly. “No substance in 
nature should react like that. And 
you saw it work last night also?” 
“Damned well right,” Fred said. 
“They brought in this hunter — he 
had his head pulled half off. He 
swallowed some of that stuff and 
healed right before my eyes.” 
“Man’s age-old dream,” Carver 
mused. “A universal panacea!” 

“We could get any price for stuff 
like that,” Fred said. 

“Yes, we could— as well as per- 
forming a duty to science,” Profes- 
sor Carver reminded him sternly. 
“Yes, Fred, I think we should ob- 
tain some of that substance.” 

They turned and, with firm 
strides, marched back to the village. 

Dances were in progress, given 
by various members of the beast 
cults. At the moment, the Sathgo- 
hani, a cult representing a medium- 
sized deerlike animal, were per- 
forming. They could be recognized 
by the three red dots on their fore- 
heads. Waiting their turn were the 
men of the Dresfeyxi and the 
Taganyes, cults representing other 
forest animals. The beasts adopted 
by the cults were taboo and there 
was an absolute injunction against 



THE SWEEPER OF LORAY 



133 



their slaughter. Carver had been un- 
able to discover the rationale be- 
hind this rule. The Lorayans re- 
fused to speak of it. 

Deg, the medicine man, had re- 
moved his ceremonial mask. He 
was seated in front of his hut, watch- 
ing the dancing. He arose when the 
Earthmen approached him. 
“Peace!” he said. 

“Sure,” said Fred. “Nice job you 
did this morning.” 

Deg smiled modestly. “The gods 
answered our prayers.” 

“The gods?” said Carver. “It 
looked as though the serum did 
most of the work.” 

“Serum? Oh, the sersee juice!” 
Deg made a ceremonial gesture as 
he mentioned the name. “Yes, the 
sersee juice is the mother of the 
Lorayan people.” 

“We’d like to buy some,” Fred 
said bluntly, ignoring Professor 
Carver’s disapproving frown. “What 
would you take for a gallon?” 

“I am sorry,” Deg said. 

“How about some nice beads? 
Mirrors? Or maybe a couple of 
steel knives?” 

“It cannot be done,” the medicine 
man asserted. “The sersee juice is 
sacred. It must be used only for holy 
healing.” 

“Don’t hand me that,” Fred said, 
a flush mounting his sallow cheek. 
“You gooks think you can — ” 

“We quite understand,” Carver 
broke in smoothly. “We know 
about sacred things. Sacred things 



are sacred. They are not to be 
touched by profane hands.” 

“Are you crazy?” Fred whispered 
in English. 

“You are a wise man,” Deg said 
gravely. “You understand why I 
must refuse you.” 

“Of course. But it happens. Deg, 
I am a medicine man in my own 
country.” 

“Ah? I did not know this!” 

“It is so. As a matter of fact, in 
my particular line, I am the highest 
medicine man.” 

“Then you must be a very holy 
man,” Deg said, bowing his head. 

“Man, he’s holy!” Fred put in 
emphatically. “Holiest man you’ll 
ever see around here.” 

“Please, Fred,” Carver said, 
blinking modestly. He said to the 
medicine man, “It’s true, although 
I don’t like to hear about it. Under 
the circumstances, however, you 
can see that it would not be wrong 
to give me some sersee juice. On 
the contrary, it is your priestly duty 
to give me some.” 

The medicine man pondered for 
a long time while contrary emotions 
passed just barely perceptibly over 
his almost blank face. At last he 
said, “It may be so. Unfortunately, 
I cannot do what you require.” 
“Why not?” 

“Because there is so little sersee 
juice, so terribly little. There is 
hardly enough for the village.” 
Deg smiled sadly and walked 
away.

GALAXY 



T IFE in the village continued its 
simple, invariant way. The 
Sweeper moved slowly along, clean- 
ing with his twig broom. The hunt- 
ers trekked out in search of srags. 
The women of the village prepared 
food and looked after the village’s 
one child. The priests and dancers 
prayed nightly for the sun to rise 
in the morning. Everyone was satis- 
fied, in a humble, submissive fash- 
ion. 

Everyone except the Earthmen. 

They had more talks with Deg 
and slowly learned the complete 
story of the sersee juice and the 
troubles surrounding it. 

The sersee bush was a small and 
sickly affair. It did not flourish in 
a state of nature. Yet it resisted 
cultivation and positively defied 
transplantation. The best one could 
do was to weed thoroughly around 
it and hope it would blossom. But 
most sersee bushes struggled for 
a year or two, then gave up the 
ghost. A few blossomed, and a few 
out of the few lived long enough to 
produce their characteristic red 
berries. 

From the berry of the sersee 
bush was squeezed the elixir that 
meant life to the people of Loray. 

“And you must remember,” Deg 
pointed out, “how sparsely the ser- 
see grows and how widely scattered 
it is. We must search for months, 
sometimes, to find a single bush 
with berries. And those berries will 
save the life of only a single Loray- 



an, or perhaps two at the most.” 
“Sad, very sad,” Carver said. “But 
surely some form of intensive fertil- 
ization — ” 

“Everything has been tried.” 

“I realize,” Carver said earnestly, 
“how important the sersee juice is 
to you. But if you could give us a 
little — even a pint or two — we 
could take it to Earth, have it ex- 
amined, synthesized, perhaps. Then 
you could have all you need.” 

“But we dare not give any. Have 
you noticed how few children we 
have?” 

Carver nodded. 

“There are very few births. Our 
life is a constant struggle against 
the obliteration of our race. Every 
man’s life must be preserved until 
there is a child to replace him. And 
this can be done only by our con- 
stant and never-ending search for 
the sersee berries. And there are 
never enough,” the medicine man 
sighed. “Never enough.” 

“Does the juice cure every- 
thing?” Fred asked. 

“It does more than that. Those 
who have tasted sersee add fifty 
of our years to their lives.” 

Carver opened his eyes wide. Fif- 
ty years on Loray was roughly the 
equivalent of sixty-three on Earth. 

The sersee was more than a heal- 
ing agent, more than a regenerator. 
It was a longevity drug as well. 

He paused to consider the pros- 
pect of adding another sixty years 
to his lifetime. Then he asked, 



THE SWEEPER OF LORAY 



135 



“What happens if a man takes ser- 
see again after the fifty years?” 
“We do not know,” Deg told him. 
“No man would take it a second 
time while there is not enough.” 
Carver and Fred exchanged 
glances. 

“Now listen to me carefully, 
Deg,” Professor Carver said. He 
spoke of the sacred duties of science. 
Science, he told the medicine man, 
was above race, above creed, above 
religion. The advancement of sci- 
ence was above life itself. What 
did it matter, after all, if a few more 
Lorayans died? They would die 
eventually anyhow. The important 
thing was for Terran science to have 
a sample of sersee. 

“It may be as you say,” Deg 
said. “But my choice is clear. As a 
priest of the Sunniheriat religion, 
I have a sacred trust to preserve the 
lives of my people. I cannot go 
against this trust.” 

He turned and walked off. The 
Earthmen frustratedly returned to 
their spaceship. 

A FTER coffee, Professor Carver 
opened a drawer and took out 
the manuscript of Underlying 
Causes for the Implicit Inferiority 
of Non-Terran Races. Lovingly he 
read over the last chapter, the 
chapter that dealt with the special- 
ized inferiorities of the Lorayan 
people. Then he put the manuscript 
away. 

“Almost finished, Fred,” he told 



his assistant. “Another week’s work, 
two weeks at the most!” 

“Um,” Fred replied, staring at 
the village through a porthole. 

“This will do it,” Carver said. 
“This book will prove, once and 
for all, the natural superiority of 
Terrans. We have proven it by 
force of arms, Fred, and we have 
proven it by our technology. Now 
it is proven by the impersonal proc- 
esses of logic.” 

Fred nodded. He knew the pro- 
fessor was quoting from the book’s 
introduction. 

“Nothing must interfere with the 
great work,” Carver said. “You 
agree with that, don’t you?” 

“Sure,” Fred said absent-minded- 
ly. “The book comes first. Put the 
gooks in their place.” 

“Well, I didn’t exactly mean that. 
But you know what I mean. Under 
the circumstances, perhaps we 
should forget about sersee. Perhaps 
we should just finish the job we 
started.” 

Fred turned and faced his em- 
ployer. “Professor, how much do 
you expect to make out of this 
book?” 

“Hm? Well, the last did quite 
well, you will remember. This book 
should do even better. Ten, perhaps 
twenty thousand dollars!” He per- 
mited himself a small smile. “I am 
fortunate, you see, in my subject 
matter. The general public of Earth 
seems to be rather interested in it, 
which is gratifying for a scientist.” 



136 



GALAXY 



Say you even make fifty thou- 
sand. Chicken feed! Do you know 
what we could make on a test tube 
of sersee?” 

“A hundred thousand?” Carver 
said vaguely. 

“Are you kidding? Suppose a rich 
guy was dying and we had the only 
thing to cure him. He’d give every- 
thing he owned! Millions!” 

“I believe you’re right,” Carver 
agreed. “And it would be a valuable 
scientific advancement. But the 
medicine man unfortunately won’t 
give us any.” 

“Buying isn’t the only way.” Fred 
unholstered his revolver and 
checked the chambers. 

“I see, I see,” Carver said, his 
red face turning slightly pale. “But 
have we the right?” 

“What do you think?” 

“Well, they are inferior. I believe 
I have proven that conclusively. 
You might indeed say that their 
lives don’t weigh heavily in the 
scheme of things. Hm, yes — yes, 
Fred, we could save Terran lives 
with this!” 

“We could save our own lives,” 
Fred said. “Who wants to punk out 
ahead of time?” 

Carver stood up and determined- 
ly loosened his gun in its holster. 
“Remember,” he told Fred, “we 
are doing this in the name of 
science, and for Earth.” 

“Absolutely, Professor,” Fred 
said, moving toward the port, grin- 
ning. 



r I ’HEY found Deg near the medi- 
cine hut. Carver said, without 
preamble, “We must have some 
sersee.” 

“But I explained to you,” said 
the medicine man. “I told you why 
it was impossible.” 

“We gotta have it,” Fred said. 
He pulled his revolver from its hol- 
ster and looked ferociously at Deg. 

“No.” 

“You think I’m kidding?” Fred 
asked. “You know what this weapon 
can do?” 

“I have seen you use it.” 

“Maybe you think I won’t use it 
on you.” 

“I do not care. You can have no 
sersee.” 

“I’ll shoot,” Fred warned, his 
voice rising angrily. “I swear to 
you, I’ll shoot.” 

The villagers of Loray slowly 
gathered behind their medicine 
man. Gray-skinned, knobby-head- 
ed, they moved silently into posi- 
tion, the hunters carrying their 
spears, other villagers armed with 
knives and stones. 

“You cannot have the sersee,” 
Deg said. 

Fred slowly leveled the revolver. 

“Now, Fred,” said Carver, “there’s 
an awful lot of them. Do you really 
think — ” 

Fred’s thin body tightened and 
his finger grew taut and white on 
the trigger. Carver closed his eyes. 

There was a moment of dead 
silence. Then the revolver explod- 



THE SWEEPER OF LORAY 



137 



ed. Carver warily opened his eyes. 

The medicine man was still erect, 
although his knees were shaking. 
Fred was pulling back the hammer 
of the revolver. The villagers had 
made no sound. It was a moment 
before Carver could figure out 
what had happened. At last he saw 
the Sweeper. 

The Sweeper lay on his face, 
his outstretched left hand still 
clutching his twig broom, his legs 
twitching feebly. Blood welled from 
the hole Fred had neatly drilled 
through his forehead. 

Deg bent over the Sweeper, then 
straightened. “He is dead,” the 
medicine man said. 

“That’s just the first,” Fred 
warned, taking aim at a hunter. 

“No!” cried Deg. 

Fred looked at him with raised 
eyebrows. 

“I will give it to you,” Deg said. 
“I will give you all our sersee juice. 
Then you must go!” 

He ran into the medicine hut and 
reappeared a moment later with 
three wooden tubes, which he thrust 
into Fred’s hands. 

“We’re in business, Professor,” 
Fred said. “Let’s get moving!” 

They walked past the silent vil- 
- lagers, toward their spaceship. 
Something bright flashed in the 
sunlight. Fred yipped and dropped 
his revolver. Professor Carver hast- 
ily scooped it up. 

“One of those gooks cut me,” 
Fred said. “Give me the revolver!” 



A spear arced high and buried 
itself at their feet. 

“Too many of them,” said Carver. 
“Let’s run for it!” 

They sprinted to their ship with 
spears and knives singing around 
them, reached it safely and bolted 
the port. 

“Too close,” Carver said, panting 
for breath, leaning against the 
dogged port. “Have you got the 
serum?” 

“I got it,” said Fred, rubbing his 
arm. “Damn!” 

“What’s- wrong?” 

“My arm. It feels numb.” 

I" 1 ARVER examined the wound, 
^ pursed his lips thoughtfully, but 
made no comment. 

“It’s numb,” Fred said. “I wonder 
if they poison those spears.” 

“It’s quite possible,” Professor 
Carver admitted. 

“They did!” Fred shouted." Look, 
the cut is changing color already!” 
The edges of the wound had a 
blackened, septic look. 

“Sulfa,” Carver said. “Penicillin, 
too. I wouldn’t worry much about 
it, Fred. Modern Terran drugs — ” 
might not even touch this 
stuff. Open one of those tubes!” 
“But, Fred,” Carver objected, 
“we have so little of it. Besides — ” 
“To hell with that,” Fred said. He 
took one of the tubes and uncorked 
it with his teeth. 

“Wait, Fred!” 

“Wait, nothing!” 



138 



GALAXY 



Fred drained the contents of the 
tube and flung it down. Carver said 
testily, “I was merely going to point 
out that the serum should be tested 
before an Earthman uses it. We 
don’t know how it’ll react on a 
human. It was for your own good.” 

“Sure it was,” Fred said mocking- 
ly. “Just look at how the stuff is 
reacting.” 

The blackened wound had 
turned flesh-colored again and was 
sealing. Soon there was a line of 
white scar tissue. Then even that 
was gone, leaving firm pink flesh 
beneath. 

“Pretty good, huh?” Fred gloat- 
ed, with a slight touch of hysteria. 
“It works, Professor, it works! Drink 
one yourself, pal, live another sixty 
years. Do you suppose we can syn- 
thesize this stuff? Worth a million, 
worth ten million, worth a billion. 
And if we can’t, there’s always good 
old Loray. We can drop back every 
fifty years or so for a refill. The stuff 
even tastes good, Professor. Tastes 
like — what’s wrong?” 

Professor Carver was staring at 
Fred, his eyes wide with astonish- 
ment. 

“What’s the matter?” Fred asked, 
grinning. “Ain’t my seams straight? 
What you staring at?” 

Carver didn’t answer. His mouth 
trembled. Slowly he backed away. 

“What the hell is wrong!” Fred 
glared at Carver. Then he ran to 
the spaceship’s head and looked in 
the mirror. 



“What’s happened to me?” 

Carver tried to speak, but no 
words came. He watched as Fred’s 
features slowly altered, smoothed, 
became blank, rudimentary, as 
though nature had drawn there a 
preliminary sketch of intelligent 
life. Strange knobs were coming out 
on Fred’s head. His complexion 
was changing slowly from pink to 
gray. 

iiT told you to wait,” Carver 
sighed. 

“What’s happening?” asked Fred 
in a frightened whimper. 

“Well,” Carver said, “it must all 
be residual in the sersee. The Lor- 
ayan birth-rate is practically non- 
existent, you know. Even with the 
sersee’s healing powers, the race 
should have died out long ago. Un- 
less the serum had another purpose 
as well — the ability to change lower 
animal forms into the Lorayan 
form.” 

“That’s a wild guess!” 

“A working hypothesis based 
upon Deg’s statement that sersee is 
the mother of the Lorayan people. 
I’m afraid that is the true meaning 
of the beast cults and the reason 
they are taboo. The various beasts 
must be the origins of certain por- 
tions of the Lorayan people, per- 
haps all the Lorayan people. Even 
the topic is taboo; there clearly is 
a deep-seated sense of inferiority 
about their recent step up from 
bestiality.” 



THE SWEEPER OF LORAY 



139 



Carver rubbed his forehead 
wearily. “The sersee juice has,” he 
continued, “we may hazard, a role- 
sharing in terms of the life of the 
race. We may theorize — ” 

“To hell with theory,” Fred said, 
and was horrified to find that his 
voice had grown thick and guttural, 
like a Lorayan voice. “Professor, do 
something!” 

“There’s nothing I can do.” 
“Maybe Terran science — ” 

“No, Fred,” Carver said quietly. 
“What?” 

“Fred, please try to understand. 
I can’t bring you back to Earth.” 
“What do you mean? You must 
be crazy!” 

“Not at all. How can I bring you 
back with such a fantastic story? 
They would consider the whole 
thing a gigantic hoax.” 

“But 

“Listen to me. No one would be- 
lieve! They would consider, rather, 
that you were an unusually intelli- 
gent Lorayan. Your very presence, 
Fred, would undermine the whole 
thesis of my book!” 

“You can’t leave me,” Fred said. 
“You just can’t do that.” 

Professor Carver still had both 
revolvers. He stuck one in his belt 
and leveled the other. 

“I am not going to endanger the 
work of a lifetime. Get out, Fred.” 
“No!” 

“I mean it. Get out, Fred.” 

“I won’t! You’ll have to shoot 
me!” 



“I will if I must,” Carver assured 
him. “I’ll shoot you and throw you 
out.” 

He took aim. Fred backed to the 
port, undogged it, opened it The 
villagers were waiting quietly out- 
side. 

“What will they do to me?” 

“I’m really sorry, Fred,” Carver 
said. 

“I won’t go!” Fred shrieked, grip- 
ping the edges of the port with both 
hands. 

Carver shoved him into the wait- 
ing hands of the crowd and threw 
the remaining tubes of sersee after 
him. Then, quickly, not wishing to 
see what was going to happen, he 
sealed the port. 

Within an hour, he was leaving 
the planet’s atmospheric limits. 

WHEN he returned to Earth, his 
’ ’ book, Underlying Causes of 
the Implicit Inferiority of Non- 
Terran Peoples, was hailed as a 
milestone in comparative anthro- 
pology. But he ran into some diffi- 
culty almost at once. 

A space captain named Jones 
returned to Earth and maintained 
that, on the planet Loray, he had 
discovered a native who was in 
every significant way the equal of 
a Terran. And he had tape record- 
ings and motion pictures to prove 
it 

Carver’s thesis seemed in doubt 
for some time, until Carver exam- 
ined the evidence for himself. Then 



140 



GALAXY 



he pointed out, with merciless logic, 
that the so-called super-Lorayan, 
this paragon of Loray, this supposed 
equal of Terran humanity, occupied 
the lowest position in the Lorayan 
hierarchy, the position of Sweeper, 
clearly shown by the broad black 
stripe across his face. 

The space captain admitted that 
this was true. 

Why then, Carver thundered, 
was this Lorayan Superior not able, 



in spite of his so-called abilities, to 
reach any higher position in the de- 
based society in which he dwelt? 

The question silenced the space 
captain and his supporters, de- 
molished the entire school, as a 
matter of fact. And the Carverian 
Doctrine of the Implicit Inferiority 
of Non-Terrans is now accepted by 
reasoning Terrans everywhere in 
the Galaxy.

A CASE OF CONSCIENCE by 
James Blish. Ballantine Books, 
N.Y., $2.00 

^ ENERALLY, SF authors steer 
clear of religious themes with 
greater reason than mainstream au- 
thors. It’s a ticklish task even for 
the latter. In our specialized field, 
such necks stuck out usually mean 
heads lopped off. Very few success- 
ful examples pop into mind. Mil- 
ler’s “Canticle for Liebowitz” and 
certain shorts of Boucher’s are 
most easily recalled. 

However, religion is a most 
valid theme. That it is difficult to 
★ ★ ★ ★ ★ SHELF 



handle acceptably does not dis- 
qualify it. The reverse, rather — a 
challenge of this magnitude de- 
mands talent and skill equal to 
it. 

Given that, the result is bound 
to be a significant one. 

Blish’s choice of a Jesuit as a 
member of a Planetary Commis- 
sion is logical: Jesuits have long 
been explorers and scientists and 
doubtless will continue even be- 
yond the Earth’s atmosphere. His 
concepts and precepts are particu- 
larly controversial, as they must be 
in so foreign an environment. 

Although the book tends to ex- 

143 



treme unevenness, this profound 
story of an alien moralistic para- 
dise, its inhumanly good code of 
ethics and the unintended threat 
to Earth’s equanimity that it rep- 
resents, is a provocative, serious, 
commendable work. Such trail- 
blazers are exceedingly hard to 
come by.

ON AN ODD NOTE by Gerald 
Kersh. Ballantine Books, N. Y., 
$2.00 

I HAVE always had small quar- 
rel with the Ballantine squibs. 
However, to describe as science 
fiction this Kersh collection is con- 
siderable point-stretching. 

A handful of stories touch the 
outer perimeter of fantasy-science: 
“The Eye,” a transplant story such 
as underwent multiple jeopardy 
during Hollywood’s “Karloff Peri- 
od,” but in Kersh’s treatment head, 
shoulders, knees and ankles above 
its ilk; “Frozen Beauty,” concern- 
ing a resuscitated Siberian Ice Age 
female; the time-warp effect of 
the Hiroshima bomb in “The 
Brighton Monster”— these qualify, 
but the remaining ten do not. 
Good fiction, yes. Science fiction, 
no. 

Kersh is a phrase-turner of 
prime distinction: “To die, that’s 
nothing. It’s easier to die than to 
live, once you get the hang of it.” 
If off-trail, well-written fantasy 
is your dish, here’s a tureen of it.

THE TORTURED PLANET by 
C. S. Lewis. Avon Publications, 
Inc., N.Y., 35^ 

T HIRD of a trilogy, ( Perelan - 
dr a, Out oi the Silent Planet ) 
this book is another of Lewis’s 
allegorical treatments of the con- 
flict between biblical Good and 
Evil. Though less known than its 
famous predecessors, it bears the 
authentic stamp of its creator’s 
awesome imagination — awesome 
in the archaic sense. 

A tiny English college town is 
the apex of conflict; a stuffy young 
Fellow of Sociology and his clair- 
voyant wife are the axis around 
which the story revolves, the hus- 
band an unthinking tool of the 
evil N.I.C.E. — National Institute 
of Coordinated Experiments, and 
the wife the seer of the 78 th Pen- 
dragon of Logres in direct line of 
succession from King Arthur. 
However, both earthly rival groups 
are merely tools of infinitely su- 
perior supra-normal forces. 

From calm beginnings, Lewis’s 
Apocalyptic warning is soon in full 
shriek, aided by such grisly shock- 
ers as the living Pavlovian head 
of a guillotined French murderer, 
the body of Merlin the Druid dug 
living from its age-old tomb, and 
a viciously sadistic female boss 
of secret police known as “Fairy” 
Hardcastle.

WHAT’S GOING ON IN SPACE 
by Commander David C. Holmes. 
Funk and W agnails Co., N.Y., 
$3.95 

W ITH Commander Holmes, 
the Armed Services have 
added yet another to their group 
of exceedingly articulate spokes- 
men. His breezily titled book is 
informative, authoritative and jam- 
filled and chockpacked with quot- 
able bromides. 

“The only way we could tell 
old time test pilots apart (sole 
interests: women and planes) was 
by the altitude at which we found 
them.” 

Following his conquest of space, 
“man as we know him today may 
become a period piece in the vast 
furniture of life.” 

“IPBM’s (Interplanetary BM’s) 
with H-bomb warheads could 
create new moon craters with 
unique opportunities for perpetu- 
ating the names of presidents, 
prime ministers and party secre- 
taries.” 

Additionally, this is the best 
treatment to date of the first two 
Sputniks, three Explorers and first 
Vanguard. And, basing his guess 
on some sound information, 
Holmes is convinced that a suc- 
cessful moon shot by 1960 is a 



145 



certainty. Maybe he and I are al- 
ready too late with this bit of in- 
side outfo.

distanced Coblentz that his books 
seem older — and ever so much 
slower — than Swift’s. 

However, technical faults aside, 
Coblentz frequently gets across a 
telling blow at our sociopolitical 
setup. Twenty-seven years, one 
universal war and countless police 
actions later, some of his observa- 
tions are as valid as most of Swift’s 
are. In fact, now that we have the 
comic opera posturings and moral- 
istic blatherings in the United Na- 
tions while conflict abounds at 
large, his picture of a ridiculous 
culture on Venus, highly indus- 
trialized yet socially nonsensical, 
has parallels that hurt. 

So, although Pohl and Korn- 
bluth, among others, have done 
far superior satirical jobs, Coblentz 
does retain a certain historical 
value.

SPACE BOOK FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE by Homer E. Newell, 
Jr. Whittlesey House, N.Y., $2.95 

T HE period since Sputnik I has 
seen scores of space books pub- 
lished and I find arresting the fact 
that so many authors are part of 
the space program in one way or 
another. This is a far departure 
from the close-mouthed attitude of 
our Armed Services pre-Oct. ’57. 
For instance, Newell has such un- 
usual qualifications that I find it 
even more edifying to review the 
author than his lucid little book. 

Three years teacher of math- 
ematics at U. of Wise., four at U. 
of Maryland; joined Naval Re- 
search Lab 1944; 1947, named 
head of Rocket Sonde Branch in 
charge of rocket upper-air research 
program; 1955, Acting Superinten- 
dent of Atmosphere and Astro- 
physics Division which includes 
Rocket Sonde, Radio Astronomy, 
Atmospheric Electricity and Aer- 
ology. Also Science Program Co- 
ordinator for Project Vanguard. 

There’s still more, but best of 
all — it’s a good book, written by 
one with knowledge to impart and 
the knowledge of how best to im- 
part it.

When the People Fell 

By CORDWAINER SMITH 

The biggest news story in all 
history had happened centuries 
ago — but he was an eyewitness! 



Illustrated by SIEGEL 



AN you imagine a rain of 
fl people through an acid 
\ J fog? Can you imagine 
thousands and thousands of hu- 
man bodies, without weapons, 
overwhelming the unconquerable 
monsters? Can you — ” 

“Look, sir,” interrupted the re- 
porter. 

“Don’t interrupt me! You ask 
me silly questions. I tell you I saw 
the Goonhogo itself. I saw it take 
Venus. Now ask me about that!” 
The reporter had called to get 
an old man’s reminiscences about 



bygone ages. He did not expect 
Dobyns Bennett to flare up at 
him. 

Dobyns Bennett thrust home 
the psychological advantage he 
had gotten by taking the initiative. 
“Can you imagine showhices in 
their parachutes, a lot of them 
dead, floating out of a green sky? 
Can you imagine mothers crying 
as they fell? Can you imagine 
people pouring down on the poor 
helpless monsters?” 

Mildly, the reporter asked what 
showhices were. 



WHEN THE PEOPLE FELL 



147 



“That’s old Chinesian for chil- 
dren,” said Dobyns Bennett. “I 
saw the last of the nations burst 
and die, and you want to ask me 
about fashionable clothes and 
things. Real history never gets 
into the books. It’s too shocking. 
I suppose you were going to ask 
me what I thought of the new 
striped pantaloons for women!” 

“No,” said the reporter, but he 
blushed. The question was in his 
notebook and he hated blushing. 

“Do you know what the Goon- 
hogo did?” 

f What?” asked the reporter, 
struggling to remember just what 
a Goonhogo might be. 

“It took Venus,” said the old 
man, somewhat more calmly. 

Very mildly, the reporter mur- 
mured, “It did?” 

“You bet it did!” said Dobyns 
Bennett belligerently. 

“Were you there?” asked the 
reporter. 

“You bet I was there when the 
Goonhogo took Venus,” said the 
old man. “I was there and it’s the 
damnedest thing I’ve ever seen. 
You know who I am. I’ve seen 
more worlds than you can count, 
boy, and yet when the nondies 
and the needies and the showhices 
came pouring out of the sky, that 
was the worst thing that any man 
could ever see. Down on the 
ground, there were the loudies the 
way they’d always been — ” 

The reporter interrupted, very 



gently. Bennett might as well have 
been speaking a foreign language. 
All of this had happened three 
hundred years before. The re- 
porter’s job was to get a feature 
from him and to put it into a 
language which people of the pres- 
ent time could understand. 



r> ESPECTFULLY he said, 
-*-*• “Can’t you start at the begin- 
ning of the story?” 

“You bet. That’s when I mar- 
ried Terza. Terza was the prettiest 
girl you ever saw. She was one of 
the Vomacts, a great family of 
scanners, and her father was a 
very important man. You see, I 
was thirty-two, and when a man 
is thirty-two, he thinks he is pretty 
old, but I wasn’t really old, I just 
thought so, and he wanted Terza 
to marry me because she was such 
a complicated girl that she needed 
a man’s help. The Court back 
home had found her unstable and 
the Instrumentality had ordered 
her left in her father’s care until 
she married a man who then 
could take on proper custodial 
authority. I suppose those are old 
customs to you, boy—” 

The reporter interrupted again. 
“I am sorry, old man,” said he. “I 
know you are over four hundred 
years old and you’re the only per- 
son who remembers the time the 
Goonhogo took Venus. Now the 
Goonhogo was a government, 
wasn’t it?” 



148 



GALAXY 



“Anyone knows that,” snapped 
the old man. “The Goonhogo was 
a sort of separate Chinesian gov- 
ernment. Seventeen billion of 
them all crowded in one small part 
of Earth. Most of them spoke 
English the way you and I do, 
but they spoke their own lan- 
guage, too, with all those funny 
words that have come on down to 
us. They hadn’t mixed in with 
anybody else yet. Then, you see, 
the Waywanjong himself gave the 
order and that is when the people 
started raining. They just fell right 
out of the sky. You never saw 
anything like it—” 

The reporter had to interrupt 
him again and again to get the 
story bit by bit. The old man kept 
using terms that he couldn’t seem 
to realize were lost in history and 
that had to be explained to be in- 
telligible to anyone of this era. 
But his memory was excellent and 
his descriptive powers as sharp 
and alert as ever . 

'Y’OUNG Dobyns Bennett had 
not been at Experimental 
Area A very long, before he realized 
that the most beautiful female he 
had ever seen was Terza Vomact. 
At the age of fourteen, she was 
fully mature. Some of the Vo- 
macts diti mature that way. It 
may have had something to do 
with their being descended from 
unregistered, illegal people cen- 
turies back in the past. They were 



even said to have mysterious con- 
nections with the lost world back 
in the age of nations when people 
could still put numbers on the 
years. 

He fell in love with her and 
felt like a fool for doing it. 

She was so beautiful, it was 
hard to realize that she was the 
daughter of Scanner Vomact him- 
self. The scanner was a powerful 
man. 

Sometimes romance moves too 
fast and it did with Dobyns Ben- 
nett because Scanner Vomact 
himself called in the young man 
and said, “I’d like to have you 
marry my daughter Terza, but I’m 
not sure she’ll approve of you. 
If you can get her, boy, you have 
my blessing.” 

Dobyns was suspicious. He 
wanted to know why a senior 
scanner was willing to take a 
junior technician. 

All that the scanner did was to 
smile. He said, “I’m a lot older 
than you, and with this new san- 
taclara drug coming in that may 
give people hundreds of years, 
you may think that I died in my 
prime if I die at a hundred and 
twenty. You may live to four or 
five hundred. But I know my 
time’s coming up. My wife has 
been dead for a long time and we 
have no other children and I know 
that Terza needs a father in a 
very special kind of way. The 
psychologist found her to be un- 



WHEN THE PEOPLE FELL 



149 



stable. Why don’t you take her 
outside the area? You can get a 
pass through the dome anytime. 
You can go out and play with the 
loudies.” 

Dobyns Bennett was almost as 
insulted as if someone had given 
him a pail and told him to go play 
in the sandpile. And yet he real- 
ized that the elements of play in 
courtship were fitted together and 
that the old man meant well. 

The day that it all happened, 
he and Terza were outside the 
dome. They had been pushing 
loudies around. 

Loudies were not dangerous 
unless you killed them. You could 
knock them down, push them out 
of the way, or tie them up; after 
a while, they slipped away and 
went about their business. It took 
a very special kind of ecologist 
to figure out what their business 
was. They floated two meters high, 
ninety centimeters in diameter, 
gently just above the land of 
Venus, eating microscopically. For 
a long time, people thought there 
was radiation on which they sub- 
sisted. They simply multiplied in 
tremendous numbers. In a silly 
sort of way, it was fun to push 
them around, but that was about 
all there was to do. 

They never responded with in- 
telligence. 

Once, long before, a loudie 
taken into the laboratory for ex- 
perimental purposes had typed a 



perfectly clear message on the 
typewriter. The message had read, 
“Why don’t you Earth people go 
back to Earth and leave us alone? 
We are getting along all—” 

And that was all the message 
that anybody had ever got out of 
them in three hundred years. The 
best laboratory conclusions was 
that they had very high intelli- 
gence if they ever chose to use it, 
but that their volitional mech- 
anism was so profoundly different 
from the psychology of human 
beings that it was impossible to 
force a loudie to respond to stress 
as people did on Earth. 

f 1 1 HE name loudie was some 
kind of word in the old Chi- 
nesian language. It meant the “an- 
cient ones.” Since it was the Chin- 
esians who had set up the first out- 
posts on Venus, under the orders of 
their supreme boss the Waywon- 
jong, their term lingered on. 

Dobyns and Terza pushed 
loudies, climbed over the hills and 
looked down into the valleys 
where it was impossible to tell a 
river from a swamp. They got 
thoroughly wet, their air convert- 
ers stuck, and perspiration itched 
and tickled along their cheeks. 
Since they could not eat or drink 
while outside — at least not with 
any reasonable degree of safety — 
the excursion could not be called 
a picnic. There was something 
mildly refreshing about playing

child with a very pretty girl-child 
— but Dobyns wearied of the 
whole thing. 

Terza sensed his rejection of 
her. Quick as a sensitive animal, 
she became angry and petulant. 
“You didn’t have to come out with 
me!” 

“I wanted to,” he said, “but now 
I’m tired and want to go home.” 

“You treat me like a child. All 
right, play with me. Or you treat 
me like a woman. All right, be a 
gentleman. But don’t seesaw all 
the time yourself. I just got to be 
a little bit happy and you have to 
get middle-aged and condescend- 
ing. I won’t take it.” 

“Your father—” he said, realiz- 
ing the moment he said it that it 
was a mistake. 

“My father this, my father that. 
If you’re thinking about marrying 
me, do it yourself.” She glared at 
him, stuck her tongue out, ran 
over a dune, and disappeared. 

Dobyns Bennett was baffled. 
He did not know what to do. She 
was safe enough. The loudies 
never hurt anyone. He decided to 
teach her a lesson and to go on 
back himself, letting her find her 
way home when she pleased. The 
Area Search Team could find her 
easily if she really got lost. 

He walked back to the gate. 

When he saw the gates locked 
and the emergency lights on, he 
realized that he had made the 
worst mistake of his life. 



TTIS heart sinking within him, 
he ran the last few meters of 
the way, and beat the ceramic 
gate with his bare hands until it 
opened only just enough to let 
him in. 

“What’s wrong?” he asked the 
doortender. 

The doortender muttered some- 
thing which Dobyns could not 
understand. 

“Speak up, man!” shouted Do- 
byns. “What’s wrong?” 

“The Goonhogo is coming back 
and they’re taking over.” 

“That’s impossible,” said Do- 
byns. “They couldn’t—” He 
checked himself. Could they? 

“The Goonhogo’s taken over,” 
the gatekeeper insisted. “They’ve 
been given the whole thing. The 
Earth Authority has voted it to 
them. The Waywonjong has de- 
cided to send people right away. 
They’re sending them.” 

“What do the Chinesians want 
with Venus? You can’t kill a 
loudie without contaminating a 
thousand acres of land. You can’t 
push them away without them 
drifting back. You can’t scoop 
them up. Nobody can live here 
until we solve the problem of 
these things. We’re a long way 
from having solved it,” said Do- 
byns in angry bewilderment. 

The gatekeeper shook his head. 
“Don’t ask me. That’s all I hear 
on the radio. Everybody else is 
excited too.” 



152 



GALAXY 



Within an hour, the rain of 
people began. 

Dobyns went up to the radar 
room, saw the skies above. The 
radar man himself was drumming 
his fingers against the desk. He 
said, “Nothing like this has been 
seen for a thousand years or more. 
You know what there is up there? 
Those are warships, the warships 
left over from the last of the old 
dirty wars. I knew the Chinesians 
were inside them. Everybody 
knew about it. It was sort of like a 
museum. Now they don’t have any 
weapons in them. But do you 
know — there are millions of 
people hanging up there over Ve- 
nus and I don’t know what they 
are going to do!” 

He stopped and pointed at one 
of the screens. “Look, you can 
see them running in patches. 
They’re behind each other, so 
they cluster up solid. We’ve never 
had a screen look like that.” 

Dobyns looked at the screen. It 
was, as the operator said, full of 
blips. 

As they watched, one of the 
men exclaimed, ‘What’s that mil- 
ky stuff down there in the lower 
left? See, it’s — it’s pouring,” he 
said, “it’s pouring somehow out of 
those dots. How can you pour 
things into a radar? It doesn’t really 
show, does it?” 

The radar man looked at his 
screen. He said, “Search me. I 
don’t know what it is, either. 



You’ll have to find out. Let’s just 
see what happens.” 

Scanner Vomact came into the 
the room. He said, once he had 
taken a quick, experienced glance 
at the screens, “This may be the 
strangest thing we’ll ever see, but 
I have a feeling they’re dropping 
people. Lots of them. Dropping 
them by the thousands, or by the 
hundreds of thousands, or even 
by the millions. But people are 
coming down there. Come along 
with me, you two. We’ll go out 
and see it. There may be some- 
body that we can help.” 

"D Y this time, Dobyns’ con- 
science was hurting him bad- 
ly. He wanted to tell Vomact that 
he had left Terza out there, but 
he had hesitated — not only be- 
cause he was ashamed of leaving 
her, but because he did not want 
to tattle on the child to her father. 
Now he spoke. 

“Your daughter’s still outside.” 
Vomact turned on him solemn- 
ly. The immense eyes looked very 
tranquil and very threatening, but 
the silky voice was controlled. 

“You may find her.” The scan- 
ner added, in a tone which sent 
the thrill of menace up Dobyns’ 
back, “And everything will be well 
if you bring her back.” 

Dobyns nodded as though re- 
ceiving an order. 

“I shall,” said Vomact, “go out 
myself, to see what I can do, but I 



WHEN THE PEOPLE FELL 



153 



leave the finding of my daughter 
to you.” 

They went down, put on the 
extra-long-period converters, car- 
ried their miniaturized survey 
equipment so that they could find 
their way back through the fog, 
and went out Just as they were 
at the gate, the gatekeeper said, 
“Wait a moment, sir and excel- 
lency. I have a message for you 
here on the phone. Please call 
Control.” 

Scanner Vomact was not to be 
called lightly and he knew it. He 
picked up the connection unit and 
spoke harshly. 

The radar man came on the 
phone screen in the gatekeeper’s 
wall. “They’re overhead now, sir.” 

“Who’s overhead?” 

“The Chinesians are. They’re 
coming down. I don’t know how 
many there are. There must be 
two thousand warships over our 
heads right here and there are 
more thousands over the rest of 
Venus. They’re down now. If you 
want to see them hit ground, you’d 
better get outside quick.” 

Vomact and Dobyns went out. 

Down came the Chinesians. 
People’s bodies were raining right 
out of the milk-cloudy sky. Thou- 
sands upon thousands of them with 
plastic parachutes that looked like 
bubbles. Down they came. 

Dobyns and Vomact saw a 
headless man drift down. The par- 
achute cords had decapitated him. 



A woman fell near them. The 
drop had torn her breathing tube 
loose from her crudely bandaged 
throat and she was choking in her 
own blood. She staggered toward 
them, tried to babble but only 
drooled blood with mute choking 
sounds, and then fell face forward 
into the mud. 

Two babies dropped. The adult 
accompanying them had been 
blown off course. Vomact ran, 
picked them up and handed them 
to a Chinesian man who had just 
landed. The man looked at the 
babies in his arms, sent Vomact a 
look of contemptuous inquiry, put 
the weeping children down in the 
cold slush of Venus, gave them a 
last impersonal glance and ran . off 
on some mysterious errand of his 
own. 

Vomact kept Bennett from pick- 
ing up the children. “Come on, 
let’s keep looking. We can’t take 
care of all of them.” 

r T , HE world had known that the 
Chinesians had a lot of un- 
predictable public habits, but they 
never suspected that the nondies 
and the needies and the showhices 
could pour down out of a poisoned 
sky. Only the Goonhogo itself 
would make such a reckless use of 
human life. Nondies were men 
and needies were women and 
showhices were the little children. 
And the Goonhogo was a name 
left over from the old days of 



154 



GALAXY 



nations. It meant something like 
republic or state or government. 
Whatever it was, it was the organ- 
ization that ran the Chinesians in 
the Chinesian manner, under the 
Earth Authority. 

And the ruler of the Goonhogo 
was the Waywonjong. 

The Waywonjong didn’t come 
to Venus. He just sent his people. 
He sent them floating down into 
Venus, to tackle the Venusian 
ecology with the only weapons 
which could make a settlement of 
that planet possible— people them- 
selves. Human arms could tackle 
the loudies, the loudies who had 
been called “old ones” by the first 
Chinesian scouts to cover Venus. 

The loudies had to be gathered 
together so gently that they would 
not die and, in dying, each con- 
taminate a thousand acres. They 
had to be kept together by human 
bodies and arms in a gigantic liv- 
ing corral. 

Scanner Vomact rushed forward. 

A wounded Chinesian man hit 
the ground and his parachute col- 
lapsed behind him. He was clad 
in a pair of shorts, had a knife at 
his belt, canteen at his waist. He 
had an air converter attached next 
to his ear, with a tube running into 
his throat. He shouted something 
unintelligible at them and limped 
rapidly away. 

People kept on hitting the 
ground all around Vomact and 
Dobyns. 



The self-disposing parachutes 
were bursting like bubbles in the 
misty air, a moment or two after 
they touched the ground. Some- 
one had done a tricky, efficient 
job with the chemical conse- 
quences of static electricity. 

And as the two watched, the air 
was heavy with people. One time, 
Vomact was knocked down by a 
person. He found that it was two 
Chinesian children tied together. 

Dobyns asked, “What are you 
doing? Where are you going? Do 
you have any leaders?” 

He got cries and shouts in an 
unintelligible language. Here and 
there someone shouted in English 
“This way!” or “Leave us alone!” 
or “Keep going . .” but that was 
all. 

The experiment worked. 

Eighty-two million people were 
dropped in that one day. 

A FTER four hours which 
seemed barely short of end- 
less, Dobyns found Terza in a 
corner of the cold hell. Though 
Venus was warm, the suffering of 
the almost-naked Chinesians had 
chilled his blood. 

Terza ran toward him. 

She could not speak. 

She put her head on his chest 
and sobbed. Finally she managed 
to say, “I’ve — I’ve — I’ve tried to 
help, but they’re too many, too 
many, too many!” And the sentence 
ended as shrill as a scream. 



WHEN THE PEOPLE FELL 



155 



Dobyns led her back to the ex- 
perimental area. 

They did not have to talk. Her 
whole body told him that she 
wanted his love and the comfort 
of his presence, and that she had 
chosen that course of life which 
would keep them together. 

As they left the drop area, 
which seemed to cover all of Ve- 
nus so far as they could tell, a 
pattern was beginning to form. 
The Chinesians were beginning to 
round up the loudies. 

Terza kissed him mutely after 
the gatekeeper had let them 
through. She did not need to 
speak. Then she fled to her room. 

The next day, the people from 
Experimental Area A tried to see 
if they could go out and lend a 
hand to the settlers. It wasn’t 
possible to lend a hand; there 
were too many settlers. People by 
the millions were scattered all over 
the hills and valleys of Venus, 
sludging through the mud and wa- 
ter with their human toes, crush- 
ing the alien mud, crushing the 
strange plants. They didn’t know 
what to eat. They didn’t know 
where to go. They had no leaders. 

All they had were orders to 
gather the loudies together in large 
herds and hold them there with 
human arms. 

The loudies didn’t resist. 

After a time-lapse of several 
Earth days, the Goonhogo sent 
small scout cars. They brought a 



very different kind of Chinesian 
— these late arrivals were uni- 
formed, educated, cruel, smug 
men. They knew what they were 
doing. And they were willing to 
pay any sacrifice of their own 
people to get it done. « 

They brought instructions. They 
put the people together in gangs. 

It did not matter where the non- 
dies and needies had come from 
on Earth; it didn’t matter whether 
they found their own showhices or 
somebody else’s. They were shown 
the jobs to do and they got to 
work. Human bodies accomplished 
what machines could not have 
done — they kept the loudies 
firmly but gently encircled until 
every last one of the creatures was 
starved into nothingness. 

Rice fields began to appear 
miraculously. 

Scanner Vomact couldn’t be- 
lieve it. The Goonhogo biochem- 
ists had managed to adapt rice to 
the soil of Venus. And yet the 
seedlings came out of boxes in 
the scout cars and weeping people 
walked over the bodies of their 
own dead to keep the crop moving 
toward the planting. 

Venusian bacteria could not kill 
human beings, nor could they dis- 
pose of human bodies after death. 

A problem arose and was solved. 
Immense sleds carried dead men, 
women and children — those who 
had fallen wrong, or drowned as 
they fell, or had been trampled by 



156 



GALAXY 



others — to an undisclosed desti- 
nation. Dobyns suspected the ma- 
terial was to be used to add Earth- 
type organic waste to the soil of 
Venus, but he did not tell Terza. 

The work went on. 

The nondies and needies kept 
working in shifts. When they 
could not see in the darkness, they 
proceeded without seeing — keep- 
ing in line by touch or by shout. 
Foremen, newly trained, screeched 
commands. Workers lined up, 
touching fingertips. The job of 
building the fields kept on. 

?? r T , HAT’S a big story,” said the 
old man, “eighty-two million 
people dropped in a single day. 
And later I heard that the Way- 
wonjong said it wouldn’t have 
mattered if seventy million of 
them had died. Twelve million 
survivors would have been enough 
to make a spacehead for the Goon- 
hogo. The Chinesians got Venus, 
all of it. 

“But I’ll never forget the non- 
dies and the needies and the 
showhices falling out of the sky, 
men and women and children with 
their poor scared Chinesian faces. 
That funny Venusian air made 
them look green instead of tan. 
There they were, falling all around. 

“You know something, young 
man?” said Dobyns Bennett ap- 
proaching his fifth century of age. 

“What?” said the reporter. 

“There won’t be things like that 



happening on any world again. 
Because now, after all, there isn’t 
any separate Goonhogo left. There’s 
only one Instrumentality and they 
don’t care what a man’s race may 
have been in the ancient years. 
Those were the rough old days, 
the ones I lived in. Those were 
the days men still tried to do 
things.” 

Dobyns almost seemed to doze 
off, but he roused himself sharply 
and said, “I tell you, the sky was 
full of people. They fell like wa- 
ter. They fell like rain. I’ve seen 
the awful ants in Africa, and 
there’s not a thing among the stars 
to beat them for prowling horror. 
Mind you, they’re worse than any- 
thing the stars contain. I’ve seen 
the crazy worlds near Alpha Cen- 
tauri, but I never saw anything 
like the time the people fell on 
Venus. More than eighty-two mil- 
lion in one day and my own little 
Terza lost among them. 

“But the rice did sprout. And 
the loudies died as the walls of 
people held them in with human 
arms. Walls of people, I tell you, 
with volunteers jumping in to take 
the places of the falling ones. 

“They were people still, even 
when they shouted in the dark- 
ness. They tried to help each other 
even while they fought a fight that 
had to be fought without violence. 
They were people still. And they 
did so win. It was crazy and im- 
possible, but they won. Mere hu-

man beings did what machines 
and science would have taken an- 
other thousand years to do . 

“The funniest thing of all was the 
first house that I saw a nondie put 
up, there in the rain of Venus. I 
was out there with Vomact and with 
a pale sad Terza. It wasn’t much of 
a house, shaped out of twisted Ven- 
usian wood. There it was. He built 
it, the smiling half-naked Chinesian 
nondie. We went to the door and 
said to him in English, “What are 
you building here, a shelter or a 
hospital?’ 

“The Chinesian grinned at us. 
‘No,’ he said, ‘gambling.’ 

“Vomact wouldn’t believe it: 
‘Gambling?’ 

“‘Sure,’ said the nondie. ‘Gam- 
bling is the first thing a man needs 
in a strange place. It can take the 
worry out of his soul.” 

“Is that all?” said the reporter. 

OBYNS Bennett muttered that 
the personal part did not 
count. He added, “Some of my 
great-great-great-great-great-grand- 
sons may come along. You count 
those greats. Their faces will show 
you easily enough that I married 
into the Vomact line. Terza saw 
what happened. She saw how 
people build worlds. This was the 
hard way to build them. She never 
forgot the night with the dead Chi- 
nesian babies lying in the half-illum- 
inated mud, or the parachute ropes 
dissolving slowly. She heard the 



needies weeping and the helpless 
nondies comforting them and lead- 
ing them off to nowhere. She re- 
membered the cruel, neat officers 
coming out of the scout cars. She 
got home and saw the rice come up, 
and saw how the Goonhogo made 
Venus a Chinesian place.” 

“What happened to you person- 
ally?” asked the reporter. 

“Nothing much. There wasn’t 
any more work for us, so we closed 
down Experimental Area A. I mar- 
ried Terza. 

“Any time later, when I said to 
her, ‘You’re not such a bad girl!’ 
she was able to admit the truth and 
tell me she was not. That night in 
the rain of people would test any- 
body’s soul and it tested hers. She 
had met a big test and passed it. 
She used to say to me, ‘I saw it once. 
I saw the people fell, and I never 
want to see another person suffer 
again. Keep me with you, Dobyns, 
keep me with you forever.’ 

“And,” said Dobyns Bennet, “it 
wasn’t forever, but it was a happy 
and sweet three hundred years. She 
died after our fourth diamond an- 
niversary. Wasn’t that a wonderful 
thing, young man?” 

The reporter said it was. And yet, 
when he took the story back to his 
editor, he was told to put it into 
the archives. It wasn’t the right 
kind of story for entertainment and 
the public would not appreciate it 
any more.

GALAXY 



in the Mailbag 



BY GORDON R. DICKSON 

Traveling inside an official pouch gave Tardy 
no immunity whatever, diplomatic or otherwise 
— his destination was the dead-letter office ! 

Illustrated by WOOD 




T HE Right Honorable 
Joshua Guy, Ambassador 
Plenipotentiary to Dilbia, 
was smoking tobacco in a pipe. 
The fumes from it made John 
Tardy cough and strangle — or, at 
least, so it seemed. 

“Sir?” wheezed John Tardy. 
“Sorry,” said Joshua, knocking 
the pipe out in an ashtray where 
the coals continued to smolder 
only slightly less villainously than 
before. “Thought you heard me 
the first time. I said that natural- 
ly as soon as we knew you were 
being assigned to the job, we let 
out word that you were deeply 
attached to the girl.” 

“To—” John gulped air. Both 
men were talking Dilbian, to exer- 
cise the command of the language 
John had had hypnoed into him 

161 



on his way here from the Belt 
Stars, and the Dilbian nickname 
for the missing Earthian female 
sociologist came from his lips au- 
tomatically — “this Greasy Face?” 
“Miss Ty Lamorc,” nodded 
Joshua, smoothly slipping into Ba- 
sic and then out again. “Greasy 
Face, if you prefer. By the by, you 
mustn’t go taking all these Dilbian 
names at face value. The two old 
gentlemen you’re going to meet- 
Daddy Shaking Knees and Two 
Answers — aren’t what they might 
sound like. Daddy Shaking Knees 
got his name from holding up one 
end of a timber one day in an 
emergency — after about forty-five 
minutes, someone noticed his knees 
beginning to tremble. And Two 
Answers is a tribute to the Dilbian 
who can come up with more than 
one answer to a problem.” 

A BOUT to ask Joshua about his 
own Dilbian nickname of Lit- 
tle Bite, John Tardy shifted to 
safer ground. “What about this 
Schlaff fellow who—” 

“Heiner Schlaff,” interrupted 
Joshua Guy, frowning, “made a 
mistake. You’d think anyone 
would know better than to lose his 
head when a Dilbian picks him 
up. After the first time one picked 
up Heinie, he wasn’t able to step 
out onto the street without some 
Dilbian lifting him up to hear him 
yell for help. The Squeaking 
Squirt, they called him — very bad 



for Earth-Dilbian relations.” He 
looked severely at John. “I don’t 
expect anything like that from 
you.” The ambassador’s eye 
seemed to weigh John’s chunky 
body and red hair. 

No, no,” said John hastily. 

“Decathalon winner in the 
Olympics four years back, weren’t 
you?” 

Yes,” said John. “But what I 
really want is to get on an Ex- 
ploration team to one of the new 
planets. I’m a fully qualified bio- 
chemist and — ” 

I read your file. Well,” Joshua 
Guy said, “do a good job here and 
who knows?” He glanced out the 
window beside him at the sprawl- 
ing log buildings of the local Dil- 
bian town of Humrog, framed 
against the native conifers and the 
mountain peaks beyond. “But it’s 
your physical condition that’ll 
count. You understand why you 
have to go it alone, don’t you?” 
“They told me back on Earth. 
But if you can add anything—” 
“Headquarters never under- 
stands the fine points of these situ- 
ations,” said Joshua, almost cheer- 
fully. “To put it tersely — we want 
to make friends with these Dil- 
bians. They’re the race nearest to 
ours in intelligence that we’ve run 
across so far. They’d make fine 
partners. Unfortunately we don’t 
seem to be able to impress them 
very much.” 

“Size?” asked John Tardy. 



162 



GALAXY 



r 



“Well, yes — size is probably the 
biggest stumbling block. The fact 
that we’re about lap-dog propor- 
tions in relation to them. But it 
shows up even more sharply in a 
cultural dissimilarity. They don’t 
give a hang for our mechanical 
gimmicks and they’re all for per- 
sonal honor and a healthy out- 
doors life.” He looked at John. 
“You’ll say, of course, why not a 
show of force?” 

“I should think—” began John. 

“But we don’t want to fight 
them — we want to make friends 
with them. Let me give you an 
Earth-type analogy. For centuries, 
humans have been able to more or 
less tame most of the smaller 
wild animals. The large ones, how- 
ever, being unused to knuckling 
under to anyone—” 

Beep! signaled the annunciator 
on Joshua’s desk. 

“Ah, they’re here now.” Joshua 
Guy rose. “We’ll go into the re- 
ception room. Now remember that 
Boy-Is-She-Built is old Shaking 
Knees’ daughter. It was the fact 
that the Streamside Terror wanted 
her that caused all this ruckus and 
ended up with the Terror’s kid- 
napping Ty Lamorc.” 

TT E led the way through the 
door into the next room. 
John Tardy followed, his head, in 
spite of the hypno training, still 
spinning a little with the odd Dil- 
bian names — in particular Boy-Is- 



She-Built, the Basic translation of 
which was only a pale shadow of 
its Dilbian original. While not by 
any means a shy person, John 
rather hesitated to look a father 
in the eye and refer to the female 
child of his old age as — further 
reflections were cut short as he 
entered the room. 

“Ah, there, Little Bite!” boomed 
the larger of the two black-furred 
monsters awaiting them. The one 
who spoke stood well over two and 
a half meters in height — at least 
eight feet tall. “This the new one? 
Two Answers and I came right 
over to meet him. Kind of bright- 
colored on top, isn’t he?” - 

John Tardy blinked. But Joshua 
Guy answered equably enough. 

“Some of us have that color hair 
back home,” he said. “This is John 
Tardy— John, meet Shaking Knees. 
And the quiet one is Two An- 
swers.” 

“Quiet!” roared the other Dil- 
bian, bursting into gargantuan 
roars of laughter. “Me quiet! 
That’s good!” He bellowed his 
merriment. 

John stared. In spite of the 
hypno training, he could not help 
comparing these two to a couple 
of very large bears who had stood 
up on their hind legs and gone on 
a diet. They were leaner than 
bears — though leanness is rela- 
tive when you weigh upward of 
a thousand pounds — and longer- 
legged. Their noses were more pug, 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



163 



their lower jaws more humanlike 
than ursinoid in the way of chin. 
But their complete coat of thick 
black hair and their bearishness 
of language and actions made the 
comparison almost inevitable — 
though in fact their true biological 
resemblance was closer to the hu- 
mans themselves. 

“Haven’t laughed like that since 
old Souse Nose fell in the beer 
vat!” snorted Two Answers, grad- 
ually getting himself under con- 
trol. “All right, Bright Top, 
what’ve you got to say for your- 
self? Think you can take the 
Streamside Terror with one hand 
tied behind your back?” 

“I’m here,” said John Tardy, 
“to bring back — er — Greasy 
Face, and—” 

“Streamside won’t just hand her 
over. Will he, Knees?” Two An- 
swers jogged his companion with 
a massively humorous elbow. 

“Not that boy!” Shaking Knees 
shook his head. “Little Bite, I 
ought never have let you talk me 
out of a son-in-law like that. 
Tough? Rough? Tricky? My little 
girl’d do all right with a buck like 
that.” 

“I merely,” demurred Joshua, 
“suggested you make them wait 
a bit. Boy-Is-She-Built is still 
rather young—” 

“And, boy, is she built!” said 
Shaking Knees in a tone of fond, 
fatherly pride. “Still, it’s hard to 
see how she could do much bet- 



ter.” He peered suddenly at 
Joshua. “You wouldn’t have some- 
thing hidden between your paws 
on this?” 

J OSHUA Guy spread his hands 
in a wounded manner. “Would 
I risk one of my own people? 
Maybe two? All to start some- 
thing that would make the Terror 
mad onough to steal Greasy to 
pay me back?” 

“Guess not,” admitted Shaking 
Knees. “But you Shorties are 
shrewd little characters.” His 
words rang with honest admira- 
tion. 

“Thanks. The same to you,” said 
Joshua. “Now about the Terror—” 
“He headed west through the 
Cold Mountains,” replied Two An- 
swers. “He was spotted yesterday 
a half-day’s hike north, pointed 
toward Sour Ford and the Hol- 
lows. He probably nighted at Brit- 
tle Rock Inn there.” 

“Good,” said Joshua. “We’ll 
have to find a guide for my friend 
here.” 

“Guide? Ho!” chortled Shaking 
Knees. Wait’ll you see what we 
got for you.” He shouldered past 
Two Answers, opened the door 
and bellowed, “Bluffer! Come on 
in!” 

There was a moment’s pause, 
and then a Dilbian even leaner 
and taller than Shaking Knees 
shoved his way into the room, 
which, with this new Dilbian ad- 



164 



GALAXY 



dition, became decidedly crowded. 

“There you are,” said Shaking 
Knees, waving a prideful paw. 
“What more could you want? 
Walk all day, climb all night, and 
start out fresh next morning after 
breakfast. Little Bite, meet the 
Hill Bluffer!” 

“That’s me!” boomed the new- 
comer, rattling the walls. “Any- 
thing on two feet walk away from 
me? Not over solid ground or liv- 
ing rock! When I look at a hill, it 
knows it’s beat, and it lays out flat 
for my trampling feet!” 

“Very good,” said Joshua dry- 
ly. “But I don’t know about my 
friend here keeping up if you can 
travel like that.” 

“Keep up? Hah!” guffawed 
Shaking Knees. “No, no, Little 
Bite — don’t you recognize the 
Bluffer here? He’s the postman. 
We’re going to mail this half-pint 
friend of yours to the Terror. Only 
way. Cost you five kilos of nails.” 
“Nobody stops the mail,” put 
in the Hill Bluffer. 

“Hmm,” said Joshua. He glanced 
at John Tardy. “Not a bad sug- 
gestion. The only thing is how 
you plan to carry him — ” 

“Who? Him?” boomed the Bluf- 
fer, focusing on John. “Why, I’ll 
handle him like he was a week- 
old pup. I’ll wrap him in some real 
soft straw and tuck him in the 
bottom of my mailbag and—” 
“Hold it,” interrupted Joshua. 
“That’s just what I was afraid of. 



If you’re going to carry him, you’ll 
have to do it humanely.” 

<??T WON’T wear it!” the Hill 
Bluffer was still roaring, two 
hours later. The cause of his up- 
set, a system of straps and pads 
arranged into a rough saddlebag 
that would ride between his shoul- 
ders and bear John, lay on the 
crushed rock of Humrog’s main 
street. A few Dilbian bystanders 
had gathered to watch and their 
bass-voiced comments were not 
of the sort to bring the Hill Bluf- 
fer to a more reasonable frame of 
mind. 

“Listen, you tad!” Shaking 
Knees was beginning to get a little 
hot under the neck-fur himself. 
“This is your mother’s uncle’s first 
cousin speaking. You want me to 
speak to the great-grandfathers of 
your clan—” 

“Arright — arright — arright!” 
snarled the Hill Bluffer. “Buckle 
me up in the obscenity thing!” 
“That’s better!” growled Shak- 
ing Knees, simmering down as 
John Tardy and Joshua Guy went 
to work to put the saddle on. 
“Not that I blame you, but—” 
“Don’t feel so bad at that,” said 
the Hill Bluffer sulkily, wriggling 
his shoulders under the straps in 
experimental fashion. 

“You’ll find it,” grunted Joshua, 
tugging on a strap, “easier to car- 
ry than your regular bag.” 

“That’s not the point,” groused 



THE MAN IN THE MAI LBAG 



165 



the Hill Bluffer. “A postman’s got 
dignity. He just don’t wear—” He 
exploded suddenly at a snickering 
onlooker. “Whafs so funny, you? 
Want to make something out of 
it? Just say the—” 

“I’ll take care of him!” roared 
Shaking Knees, rolling forward. 
“What’s wrong with you, Split 
Nose?” 

The Dilbian addressed as Split 
Nose swallowed his grin rather 
hastily as the Humrog village chief 
took a hand in the conversation. 

“Just passing by,” he growled 
defensively, backing out of the 
crowd. 

“Well, just pass on, friend, pass 
on!” boomed Shaking Knees. He 
was rewarded by a hearty laugh 
from the crowd, and Split Nose 
rolled off down the street with 
every indication his hairy ears 
were burning. 

John had taken advantage of 
this little by-play to mount into 
the saddlebag. The Hill Bluffer 
grunted in surprise and looked 
back at him. 

“You’re light enough,” he said. 
“How is it? All right back there?” 

“Feels fine,” said John, unsus- 
pecting. 

“Then so long, everybody!” 
boomed the Hill Bluffer, and, with- 
out further warning, barreled off 
down the main street in the direc- 
tion of the North Trail, the Cold 
Mountains and the elusive but 
dangerous Streamside Terror. 



TTAD it not been for the hypno 
A-*- training, John Tardy would 
not have been able to recognize 
this fast and unexpected start for 
the Dilbian trick it was. He real- 
ized instantly, however, that the 
Hill Bluffer, having lost his en- 
thusiasm for the job at first sight 
of the harness which was to carry 
John, was attempting a little 
strategy to get out of it. Outright 
refusal to carry John was out of 
the question, but if John should 
object to the unceremoniousness 
of his departure, the Bluffer would 
be perfectly justified — by Dil- 
bian standards — if he threw up 
his hands and refused to deliver a 
piece of mail that insisted on im- 
posing conditions on him. John 
shut his mouth and hung on. 

All the same, it was awkward. 
John had intended to work out a 
plan of action with Joshua Guy 
before he left. Well, there was al- 
ways the wrist-phone. He would 
call Joshua at the first convenient 
opportunity. 

Meanwhile, it was developing 
that the Hill Bluffer had not exag- 
gerated his ability to cover ground. 
One moment they were on the 
main street of Humrog, and the 
next upon a mountain trail, green 
pinelike branches whipping by as 
John Tardy plunged and swayed 
to the Hill Bluffer’s motion like a 
man on the back of an elephant. It 
was no time for abstract thought. 
John clung to the straps before 



166 



GALAXY 



him, meditating rather bitterly on 
that natural talent of his for ath- 
letics which had got him into this, 
when by all rights he should be 
on an exploration team on one of 
the frontier planets right now. He 
was perfectly qualified, but just 
because of that decathalon win... 

He continued to nurse his griev- 
ances for something better than an 
hour, when he was suddenly inter- 
rupted by the Hill Bluffer’s grunt- 
ing and slowing down. Peering for- 
ward over the postman’s shoulder, 
John discovered another Dilbian 
who had just stepped out of the 
woods before them. The new- 
comer was on the shaggy side. He 
carried an enormous triangular- 
headed axe and had some native 
herbivore roughly the size and 
shape of a musk-ox slung casually 
over one shoulder. 

“Hello, woodsman,” said the Hill 
Bluffer, halting. 

“Hello, postman.” The other dis- 
played a gap-toothed array of 
fangs in a grin. “Got some mail 
for me?” 

“You!” the Hill Bluffer snorted. 

“Not so funny. I could get mail,” 
growled the other. He peered 
around at John. “So that’s the 
Half Pint Posted.” 

“Oh?” said the Hill Bluffer. 
“Who told you?” 

“The Cobblv Queen, that’s 
who!” retorted the other, curling 
the right side of his upper lip in 
the native equivalent of a wink. 



John Tardy, recalling the Cob- 
blies were the Dilbian equivalent 
of fairies, brownies, or what-have- 
you, peered at the woodsman to 
see if he was serious. John de- 
cided he wasn’t. Which still left 
the problem of how he had recog- 
nized John. 

13 EMEMBERING the best Dil- 
-*-*• bian manners were made of 
sheer brass, John Tardy horned 
in on the conversation. 

“Who’re you?” he demanded of 
the woodsman. 

“So it talks, does it?” The 
woodsman grinned. “They call me 
Tree Weeper, Half Pint. Because 
I chop them down, you see.” 

“Who told you about me?” 

“Oh, that’d be telling,” grinned 
Tree-Weeper. “Say, you know 
why they call him the Streamside 
Terror, Half Pint? It’s on account 
of he likes to fight alongside a 
stream, pull the other feller in and 
drown him.” 

“I know,” said John shortly. 

“Do you now?” said the other. 
“Well, it ought to be something to 
watch. Good going to you, Half 
Pint, and you too, postman. Me for 
home.” 

He turned away into the brush 
alongside the trail and it swal- 
lowed him up. The Hill Bluffer 
took up his route again without a 
word. 

“Friend of yours?” inquired 
John, when it became apparent 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



167 



the Hill Bluffer was not going to 
comment on the meeting. 

“Friend?” the Hill Bluffer 
snorted angrily. “I’m a public of- 
ficial!” 

“I just thought—” said John. 
“He seemed to know things.” 

“That hill hopper! Somebody 
ahead of us told him!” growled the 
Bluffer. But he fell unaccountably 
silent after that and said no more 
for the next three hours, until — the 
two of them having left Hum- 
rog a couple of hours past noon — 
they pulled up in the waning sun- 
light before the roadside inn at 
Brittle Rock, where they would 
spend the night. 

The first thing John Tardy did, 
after working some life back into 
his legs, was to stroll off to the 
limits of the. narrow, rocky ledge 
on which the Inn stood — Brittle 
Rock was hardly more than a wide 
spot in the narrow mountain gorge 
up which their road ran — and put 
in a call to Joshua Guy with the 
phone on his wrist. As soon as 
Joshua got on the beam, John re- 
lievedly explained the reason be- 
hind his call. It did not go over, 
apparently, very well. 

“Instructions?” floated the faint- 
ly astonished voice of the ambas- 
sador out of the receiver. “What 
instructions?” 

“The ones you were going to 
give me. Before I took off so sud- 
denly—” 

“But there’s absolutely nothing 



I can tell you,” interrupted Joshua. 
“You’ve had your hypno train- 
ing. It’s up to you. Find the Ter- 
ror and get the girl back. You’ll 
have to figure out your own means, 
my dear fellow.” 

“But—” John stopped, staring 
helpless at the phone. 

“Well, good luck, then. Call me 
tomorrow. Call me anytime.” 
“Thanks,” said John. 

“Not at all. Luck. Good-by.” 
“Good-by.” 

J OHN Tardy clicked off the 
phone and walked somberly 
back to the Inn. Inside its big 
front door, he found a wide com- 
mon room filled with tables and 
benches. The Hill Bluffer, to the 
amusement of a host of other 
travelers, was arguing with a 
femalfe Dilbian wearing an apron. 

“How the unmentionable should 
/ know what to feed him?” the 
Hill Bluffer was bellowing. “Give 
him some meat, some beer — any- 
thing!” 

“But you haven’t had the chil- 
dren dragging in pets like I have. 
Feed one the wrong thing and it 
dies. And then they cry their little 
hearts—” 

“Talking about me?” John Tar- 
dy broke in. 

“Oh!” gasped the female, glanc- 
ing down and retreating half a 
step. “It talks!” 

“Didn’t I say he did?” de- 
manded the Bluffer. “Half Pint, 



168

what kind of stuff do you eat?” 

John fingered the four-inch 
tubes of food concentrate at his 
waist. Dilbian food would not 
poison him, though he could ex- 
pect little nourishment from it, 
and a fair chance of an allergic 
reaction from certain fruits and 
vegetables. Bulk was all he needed 
to supplement the concentrates. 

“Just give me a little beer,” he 
said. 

The room buzzed approval. This 
little critter, they seemed to feel, 
could not be too alien if he liked 
to drink. The female brought him 
a wastebasket-sized wooden mug 
that had no handles and smelled 
like the most decayed of back-lot 
breweries. John took a cautious 
sip and held the bitter, sour, flat- 
tasting liquid in his mouth for an 
indecisive moment. 

He swallowed manfully. The as- 
sembled company gave vent to 
rough-voiced approval, then ab- 
ruptly turned their attention else- 
where. Looking around, he saw 
that the Hill Bluffer had gone off 
somewhere. John climbed up on 
a nearby bench and got to work 
on his food concentrates. 

After finishing these, he con- 
tinued to sit where he was for the 
better part of an hour, but the 
Hill Bluffer did not return. Struck 
by a sudden thought, John Tardy 
climbed down and went back to- 
ward the kitchen of the Inn. Push- 
ing his way through a hide curtain, 



he found himself in it — a long 
room with a stone fire-trough 
down the center, carcasses hang- 
ing from overhead beams, and a 
dozen or so Dilbians of both sexes 
equally immersed in argument and 
the preparation of food and drink. 
Among them was the female who 
had brought John the beer. 

He stepped into her path as she 
headed for the front room with a 
double handful of full mugs. 

“Eeeeek!” she exclaimed, or the 
Dilbian equivalent, stopping so 
hastily she spilled some of the 
beer. “There’s a good little Shorty,” 
she said in a quavering, coaxing 
tone. “Good Shorty. Go back now.” 
“Was the Terror really here last 
night?” John asked. 

“He stopped to pick up some 
meat and beer, but I didn’t see 
him,” she said. “I’ve no time for 
hill-and-alley brawlers. Now shoo!” 
John Tardy shooed. 

A S he was heading back to his 
bench, however, he felt him- 
self scooped up from behind. Look- 
ing back over his shoulder, he saw 
he was being carried by a large 
male Dilbian with a pouch hang- 
ing from one shoulder. This in- 
dividual carried him to a table 
where three other Dilbians sat and 
dropped him on it. John Tardy in- 
stinctively got to his feet. 

“There he be,” said the one 
who had picked him up. “A gen- 
uine Shorty.” 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



169 



“Give him some beer,” sug- 
gested one with a scar on his face, 
who was seated at the table. 

They did. John prudently drank 
some. 

“Don’t hold much,” commented 
one of the others at the table, 
examining the mug John had set 
down after what had been actually 
a very healthy draft for a human. 
“I wonder if he—” 

“Couldn’t. Not at that size,” re- 
plied the one with the pouch. “He’s 
chasing that female Shorty, though. 
You reckon—?” 

Scarface regretted that they did 
not have the Shorty female there 
at the moment. Her presence, in 
his opinion, would have provided 
the opportunity for interesting and 
educative experimentation. 

“Go to hell!” said John in Basic. 
He then made the most forceful 
translation he could manage in 
Dilbian. 

“Tough character!” said the 
pouched one, and they all laughed. 
“Better not get tough with me, 
though.” 

He made a few humorous swipes 
at John’s red head that would have 
split it on contact. They laughed 
again. 

“I wonder,” said Scarface, “can 
he do tricks?” 

“Sure,” John answered prompt- 
ly. He hefted his still-full mug of 
beer. “Watch. I take a firm grip, 
rock back, and—” He spun sud- 
denly on one heel, sloshing a wave' 



of beer into their staring faces. 
Then he was off the table and 
dodging among Dilbian and table 
legs toward the front entrance. The 
rest of the guests, roaring with 
laughter, made no attempt to halt 
him. He ducked into the outer 
darkness. 

Fumbling in the gloom, he made 
his way around the side of the Inn 
and dropped down on a broken 
keg he found there. He was just 
making up his mind to stay there 
until the Hill Bluffer came and 
found him, when the back kitchen 
door opened and closed very soft- 
ly, off to his left. 

He slipped off the keg into 
deeper shadow. He had caught 
just a glimpse out of the corner of 
his eye, but he had received the 
impression of a Dilbian female in 
the doorway. There was no sound 
now. 

He began to creep backward. 
Dilbia’s one moon was not show- 
ing over these latitudes at this 
season of the year, and the star- 
light gave only a faint illumina- 
tion. He stumbled suddenly over 
the edge of an unseen slope and 
froze, remembering the cliff edge 
overhanging the gorge below. 

A faint reek of the Dilbian odor 
came to his nostrils — and a sound 
of sniffing. Dilbians were no bet- 
ter than humans when it came to 
a sense of smell, but each had a 
perceptible odor to the nostrils of 
the other — an odor partly depend- 



170 



GALAXY 



-t 



ent on diet, partly on a differing 
physiological makeup. The odor 
John Tardy smelled was part-piny, 
part-musk. 

The sniffing ceased. John held 
his breath, waiting for it to start 
again. The pressure built up in 
his chest, and finally he was forced 
to exhale. He turned his head 
slowly from side to side. 

Silence. 

Only the inner creak of his 
tense neck muscles turning. There! 
Was that something? John began 
to creep back along the edge be- 
side him. 

There was a sudden rush, a rear- 
ing up of some huge dark shape 
in the darkness before him. He 
dodged, felt himself slipping on 
the edge, and something smashed 
like a falling wall against the side 
of his head, and he went whirling 
down and away into star-shot 
darkness. 

TTE opened his eyes to bright 
sunlight. 

The sun, just above the moun- 
tain peaks, was shining right in his 
eyes. He blinked and started to 
roll over, out of its glare, into— 

— And grabbed in a sudden cold 
sweat for the stubby trunk of a 
dwarf tree growing right out of 
the cliffside. 

For a second then, he hung 
there, sweating and looking down. 
He lay on a narrow ledge and the 
gorge was deep below. How deep, 

THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



he did not stop to figure. It was 
deep enough. 

He twisted around and looked 
up the distance of a couple of 
meters to the ledge on which the 
Inn was built. It was not far. He 
could climb it. After a little while, 
with his heart in his throat, John 
Tardy did. 

When he came back around the 
front of the Inn, in the morning 
sunlight, it was to find the Bluffer 
orating at a sort of open-air meet- 
ing, with the four who had har- 
ried John standing hangdog be- 
tween two axemen and before an 
elderly Dilbian judgelike on a 
bench. 

“—the mail!” the Hill Bluffer 
was roaring. “The mail is sacred! 
Anyone daring to lay fist upon the 
mail in transit—” 

John, tottering forward, put an 
end to the trial in progress. 

Later on, after washing his slight 
scalp-wound and having taken on 
some more food concentrates and 
flat beer for breakfast, John Tar- 
dy climbed back up on the Bluf- 
fer’s back and they were under 
way once more. Their route today 
led from Brittle Rock through the 
mountains to Sour Ford and the 
Hollows. The Hollows, John had 
learned, was clan-country for the 
Terror, and their hope was to 
catch him before he reached it. 
The trail now led across swinging 
rope suspension bridges and along 
narrow cuts in the rock — all of 

171 



which the Hill Bluffer took not 
only with the ease of one well ac- 
customed to them, but with the 
abstraction of one lost in deep 
thought. 

“Hey!” said John, at last. 

“Huh? What?” grunted the Hill 
Bluffer, coming to suddenly. 

“Tell me something,” said John, 
reaching out for anything to keep 
his carrier awake. “How’d the am- 
bassador get the name Little 
Bite?” 

“You don’t know that?” ex- 
claimed the Hill Bluffer. “I thought 
you Shorties all knew. Well, it 
was old Hammertoes down at 
Humrog.” 

The Bluffer chuckled. “Got 
drunk and all worked up about 
Shorties. ‘Gimme the good old 
days,’ he said, and went down to 
just make an example of Little 
Bite — Shorty One, we called him 
then. He pushes the door open 
far as it’ll go, but Little Bite’s got 
it fixed to only open part way. 
So there’s Hammertoes, with only 
one arm through the door, feeling 
around and hollering, ‘All right, 
Shorty! You can’t get away! I’ll 
get you—’ when Little Bite picks 
up something sharp and cuts him 
a couple times across the knuckles. 
Old Hammertoes yells bloody 
murder and yanks his hand back. 
Slam goes the door.” 

The Hill Bluffer chortled to 
himself. “Then old Hammertoes 
comes back uptown, sucking his 



knuckles. ‘What happened?’ says 
everybody. ‘Nothing,’ says Ham- 
mertoes. ‘Something must’ve hap- 
pened — look at your hand,’ every- 
body says. ‘I tell you nothing hap- 
pened!’ yells Hammertoes. ‘He 
wouldn’t let me in where I could 
grab hold of him, so I come away. 
And as for my hand, that’s got 
nothing to do with it. He didn’t 
hurt my hand hardly at all. He 
just give it a little bite!’” 

The Hill Bluffer’s laughter 
rolled like thunder between the 
mountain walls. “Old Hammer- 
toes never did live that down. 
Every time since, whenever he 
goes to give somebody a hard 
time, they all tell him, ‘Look out, 
Hammertoes, or I’m liable to give 
you a little bite!’” 

J OHN Tardy found himself 
laughing. Possibly it was the 
time and place of the telling, pos- 
sibly the story, but he could see 
the situation in his mind’s eye 
and it was funny. 

“You know,” said the Bluffer 
over one furry shoulder when 
John stopped laughing, “you’re 
not bad for a Shorty.” He fell 
silent, appeared to wrestle with 
himself for a moment, then came 
to a stop and sat down in a con- 
venient wide spot on the trail. 

“Get off,” he said. “Come around 
where I can talk to you.” 

John complied. He found him- 
self facing the seated Dilbian, their 



t 






172 



GALAXY 



heads about on a level. Behind the 
large, black-furred skull, a few 
white clouds floated in the high 
blue sky. 

“You know,” the Bluffer said, 
“the Streamside Terror’s mug’s 
been spilled.” 

“Spilled?” echoed John — then 
remembered this as a Dilbian 
phrase expressing loss of honor. 
“By me? He’s never even seen 
me.” 

“By Little Bite,” the Bluffer 
said. “But Little Bite’s a Guest 
in Humrog and the North Coun- 
try. The Terror couldn’t call him 
to account personally for speaking 
against Shaking Knees giving the 
Terror Boy-Is-She-Built. He had 
to do something, though, so he 
took Greasy Face.” 

“Oh,” said John. 

“So you got to fight the Terror 
if you want Greasy back.” 

“Fight?” John blurted. 

“Man’s got his pride,” said the 
Bluffer. “That’s why I can’t figure 
you out. I mean you aren’t bad for 
a Shorty. You got guts — like with 
those drunks last night. But you 
fighting the Terror — I mean hell!” 
said the Bluffer, in deeply moved 
tones. 

CILENTLY, John Tardy found 
^himself in full agreement with 
the postman. 

“So what’re you going to do 
when you meet Streamside?” 

“Well,” said John, rather inade- 



quately, “I don’t exactly know—” 
“Well,” growled the Bluffer in 
his turn, “not my problem. Get 
on.” John went around behind his 
furry back. “Oh, by the way, know 
who it was tried to pitch you over 
the cliff?” 

“Who?” asked John. 

“The Cobbly Queen — Boy-Is- 
She-Built!” translated the Bluf- 
fer as John looked blank. “She 
heard about you and got ahead of 
us somehow . .” The Bluffer’s 
voice trailed off into a mutter. “If 
they’re thinking of monkeying 
with the mail . .” 

John paid no attention. He had 
his own fish to fry, and very fishy 
indeed they smelled just at the 
moment. Swaying on top of the 
enormous back as they took off 
again, he found himself scowling 
over the situation. Headquarters 
had said nothing about his being 
expected to fight some monstrous 
free-style scrapper of an alien race 
— a sort of gargantuan Billy the 
Kid with a number of kills to his 
credit. Joshua Guy had not men- 
tioned it. Just what was going on 
here, anyway? 

Abruptly casting aside the secu- 
rity regulation that recommended 
a “discreet” use of the instrument, 
John lifted the wrist that bore his 
wrist-phone to his lips. 

“Josh—” he began, and suddenly 
checked. A fine trickle of sweat 
ran coldly down his spine. 

The phone was gone. 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



173 



XTE had the rest of the morning to 
ponder this new development 
in the situation, and a good por- 
tion of the afternoon. He might 
have continued indefinitely if it 
had not been for a sudden inter- 
ruption in their journey. 

They had crossed a number of 
spidery suspension bridges during 
the course of the day, and now 
they had come to another one, 
somewhat longer than any met so 
far. If this had been the only dif- 
ference, John might have been left 
to his thoughts. But this bridge 
was different. 

Somebody had fixed it so they 
couldn’t get across. 

It happened that their end of 
the bridge had its anchors sunk 
in a rock face a little back and 
some seven or eight meters above 
their heads. All that had been 
done, simply enough, was to tight- 
en the two main support cables 
at the far end. The sag of the span 
had straightened out, lifting the 
near end up above them, out of 
reach. 

The Hill Bluffer bellowed ob- 
scenely across the gap. There was 
no response from the windlass on 
the far side, or the small hut be- 
yond. 

“What’s happened?” John Tar- 
dy asked. * 

“I don’t know,” said the Bluffer, 
suddenly thoughtful. “It isn’t sup- 
posed to be rucked up except at 
night, to keep people from sneak- 



ing over and not paying toll.” 

He reached as high as he could, 
but his fingertips fell far short. 

“Lift me up,” suggested John. 

They tried it, but even upheld 
by the ankles, at the full stretch 
of the Bluffer’s arms, John was re- 
warded only by a throat-squeezing 
view of the Knobby River below. 

“It’ll take five days to go around 
by Slide Pass,” growled the Bluf- 
fer, putting John down. 

John went over to examine the 
rock face. What he discovered 
about it did not make him happy, 
though perhaps it should have. It 
was climbable. Heart tucked in 
throat, he began to go up it. 

“Hey! Where’re you going?” 
bellowed the Hill Bluffer. 

John did not answer. He needed 
his breath; anyway, his destination 
was obvious. The climb up the 
rock was not bad for someone who 
had had some mountain experi- 
ence, but a reaction set in when he 
wrapped his arms around the 
rough six-inch cable. He inched his 
way upward and got on top, both 
arms and both legs wrapped around 
the cable, and began a worm-creep 
toward the bridge end, floating on 
nothingness at a rather remark- 
able distance — seen from this 
angle — ahead of him. 

It occurred to him, after he had 
slowly covered about a third of 
the cable-distance in this fashion, 
that a real hero in a place like this 
should stand up and tightrope- 



174 



GALAXY 



walk to the bridge proper. This, in 
addition to impressing the Bluffer, 
would shorten the suspense con- 
siderably. John Tardy concluded 
he must be a conservative and 
went on crawling. 

Eventually he reached the 
bridge, crawled out on it and lay 
panting for a while, then got up 
and crossed the gorge. At the far 
end, he knocked loose the lock on 
the windlass with a heavy rock, 
and the bridge banged down into 
position, raising a cloud of dust. 

Through this same cloud of dust, 
the Hill Bluffer was shortly to be 
seen advancing with a look of grim 
purpose. He stalked past John and 
entered the hut — from which sub- 
sequently erupted thunderous 
crashes, thuds and roars. 

John Tardy looked about for a 
place of safety. He had never seen 
two Dilbians fight, but it was only 
too apparent now what was going 
on inside. 

He was still looking around, 
however, when the sound ceased 
abruptly and the Hill Bluffer 
emerged, dabbing at a torn ear. 

“Old slaver-tongue,” he growled. 
“She got at him.” 

“Who?” asked John. 

“Boy Is-She-Built. Well, mount 
up, Half Pint. Oh, by the way, 
that was pretty good.” 

“Good? What was?” 

“Climbing across the bridge that 
way. Took guts. Well, let’s go.” 
John climbed back up into his 



saddlebag and thought heavily. 

“You didn’t kill him?” he asked, 
as they started out once more. 

“Who? Old Winch Rope? Just 
knocked a little sense into him. 
Hell, there’s got to be somebody 
work the bridge. Hang on now. 
It’s all downhill from here and it’ll 
be twilight before we hit the Ford.” 

IT was indeed twilight before 
*- they reached their stopping 
place at Sour Ford. John Tardy, 
who had been dozing, awoke with 
a jerk and sat up in his saddle, 
blinking. 

In the fading light, they stood 
in a large, grassy clearing semi- 
circled by forest. Directly before 
them was a long low log building, 
and behind it a smooth-flowing 
river with its farther shore 
shrouded in tree shadow and the 
approaching dusk. 

“Get down,” said the Bluffer. 

Stiffly, John Tardy descended, 
stamped about to restore his circu- 
lation, and followed the Bluffer’s 
huge bulk through the hide-cur- 
tain of the doorway to the build- 
ing’s oil-lamplit interior. 

John discovered a large room 
like that at the Brittle Rock Inn 
— but one that was cleaner, airier, 
and filled with travelers a good 
deal less noisy and drunken. Gaz- 
ing around for the explanation be- 
hind this difference, John caught 
sight of a truly enormous Dilbian, 
grizzled with age and heavy with 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



175 



fat, seated like a patriarch in a 
huge chair behind a table at the 
room’s far end. 

John and the Bluffer found a 
table and set about eating. But as 
soon as they were through, the 
postman led John up to the pa- 
triarch. 

“One Man,” said the Bluffer in 
a respectful voice, “this here’s the 
Half Pint Posted.” 

John Tardy blinked. Up close, 
One Man had turned out to be 
even more awe-inspiring than he 
had seemed from a distance. He 
overflowed the carved chair he 
sat in, and the graying fur on top 
of his head all but brushed against 
a polished staff of hardwood laid 
crosswise on pegs driven into the 
wall two meters above the floor. 
His massive forearms and great 
pawlike hands were laid out on the 
table before him like swollen clubs 
of bone and muscle. But his face 
was almost biblically serene. 

“Sit down,” he rumbled in a 
voice so deep it sounded like a 
great drum sounding far off some- 
where in a woods. “I’ve wanted to 
see a Shorty. You’re my Guest, 
Half Pint, for as long as you wish. 
Anyone tell you about me?” 

“I’m sorry—” began John. 

“Never mind.” The enormous 
head nodded mildly. “They call 
me One Man, Half Pint, because I 
once held blood feud all by my- 
self — being an orphan — with a 
whole clan. And won.” He looked 



calmly at John. “What you might 
call an impossible undertaking.” 
“Some of them caught him on a 
trail once,” put in the Hill Bluffer. 
“He killed all three.’? 

“That was possible,” murmured 
One Man. His eyes were still on 
John. “Tell me, Half Pint, what 
are you Shorties doing here, any- 
how?” 

“Well-” John blinked. “I’m 
looking for Greasy Face—” 

“I mean the entire lot of you,” 
One Man said. “There must be 
some plan behind it. Nobody asked 
you all here, you know.” 

“Well—” said John again, rather 
lamely, and proceeded to try an 
explanation. It did not seem to go 
over very well, a technological 
civilization being hard to picture 
with the Dilbian vocabulary. 

O NE Man nodded when John 
Tardy was through. “I see. 
If that’ s the case, what makes you 
think we ought to like you Shor- 
ties?” 

“Ought to?” said John, jolted in- 
to a reactive answer, for he did 
not have red hair for nothing. 
“You don’t ought to! It’s up to 
you.” 

One Man nodded. “Pass me my 
stick,” he said. 

One of the Dilbians standing 
around took down the staff from 
its pegs and passed it to him. He 
la'id it on the table before him — 
a young post ten centimeters in 



176 



GALAXY 



thickness — grasping it with fists 
held over two meters apart. 

“No one’s ever been able to do 
this but me,” he said. 

Without lifting his fists from 
contact with the table, he rotated 
them to the outside. The staff 
sprang upward in the center like 
a bow, and snapped. 

“Souvenir for you,” said One 
Man, handing the pieces to John. 
“Good night.” 

He closed his eyes and sat as 
if dozing. The Bluffer tapped John 
on a shoulder and led him away, 
off to their sleeping quarters. 

Once in the Inn dormitory, how- 
ever, John found himself totally 
unable to sleep. He had passed 
from utter bone-weariness into a 
sort of feverish wide-awakedness, 
through which the little episode 
with One Man buzzed and circled 
like a persistently annoying fly. 

What had been the point of all 
that talk and wood-breaking? 

Suddenly and quietly, John sat 
up. Beside him, on his heap of 
soft branches, the Bluffer slept 
without stirring, as did the rest 
of the dormitory inhabitants. A 
single lamp burned high above, 
hanging from the rooftree. By its 
light, John got out and examined 
the broken pieces of wood. There 
was a little node or knot visible 
just at the point of breakage. A 
small thing, but— 

John frowned. He seemed sur- 
rounded by mysteries. The more 



he thought of it, the more certain 
he was that One Man had been 
attempting to convey some mes- 
sage to him. What was it? For that 
matter, what was going on between 
humans and Dilbians, and what 
had his mission to rescue Greasy 
Face to do with the business of 
persuading the recalcitrant Dil- 
bians into a partnership? If that 
was indeed the aim, as Joshua 
Guy had said. 

John swung out of the pile of 
boughs and to his feet. One Man, 
he decided, owed him a few more 

— and plainer — answers. 

He went softly down the length 
of the dormitory and through the 
door into the common room of the 
Inn. 

There were few Dilbians about 

— they went early to bed. And 
One Man was also nowhere to be 
seen. He had not come into the 
dormitory, John knew. So either 
he had separate quarters, or else 
he had stepped outside for some 
reason . 

John Tardy crossed the room 
and slipped out through the Inn 
entrance. He paused to accustom 
his eyes to the darkness and moved 
off from the building to get away 
from the window light. Slowly the 
night took shape around him, the 
wide face of the river running 
silver-dark in the faint light of the 
stars, and the clearing pooled in 
gloom. 

He circled cautiously around 



178

f 



the Inn to its back. Unlike Brittle 
Rock, the back yard here was 
clear of rubbish, sloping gradually 
to the river. It was given over to 
smaller huts and outbuildings. 
Among these the darkness was 
more profound and he felt his way 
cautiously. 

Groping about in this fashion, 
quietly, but with some small, un- 
avoidable noise, he saw a thin 
blade of yellow light. It cut through 
the parting of two leather cur- 
tains in the window of a hut close 
by him. He stepped eagerly to- 
ward it, about to peer through the 
crack, when, from deep wall 
shadow, a hand reached out and 
took his arm. 

“Do you want to get yourself 
killed?” hissed a voice. 

And, of course, it was human. 
And, of course, it spoke in Basic. 

WHOEVER had hold of him 
’ ' drew him deeper into the 
shadow and away from the build- 
ing where they stood. They came 
to another hut whose door stood 
ajar on an interior blackness, and 
John was led into this darkness. 
The hand let go of his arm. The 
door closed softly. There was a 
scratch, a sputter, and an animal- 
oil lamp burst into light within 
the place. 

John squinted against the sud- 
den illumination. When he could 
see again, he found himself look- 
ing into the face of one of the best- 



looking young women he had ever 
seen. 

She was a good fifteen centi- 
meters shorter than he, but at 
first glance looked taller by reason 
of her slim outline in the tailored 
coveralls she wore. To John Tar- 
dy, after two days of Dilbians, she 
looked tiny — fragile. Her chest- 
nut hair swept back in two wide 
wings on each side of her head. 
Her eyes were green above sharp- 
ly marked cheekbones that gave 
her face a sculptured look. Her 
nose was thin, her lips firm rather 
than full, and her small chin was 
determined. 

John blinked. “Who-?” 

“I’m Ty Lamorc,” she whispered 
fiercely. “Keep your voice down!” 
“Ty Lamorc? You?” 

“Yes, yes!” she said impatient- 
ly. “Now-” 

“Are y-you sure?” stammered 
John. “I mean—” 

“Who were you expecting to run 
into way out here in — oh, I see!” 
She glared at him. “It’s that Greasy 
Face name the Dilbians gave me. 
You were expecting some horror.” 
“Certainly not,” said John stout- 
ly. 

“Well, for your information, 
they just happened to see me 
putting on makeup one day. That’s 
where the name came from.” 
“Well, naturally. I didn’t think 
it was because—” 

“I’ll bet! Anyway, never mind 
that now. The point is, what are

you doing out here? Do you want 
to get knocked on the head?” 
“Who’d knock—” John Tardy 
stiffened. “The Terror’s here!” 
“No, no!” She sounded annoyed. 
“Boy Is-She-Built is.” 

“Oh.” John frowned. “You 
know, I still don’t get it — her 
angle on all this, I mean.” 

“She loves him, of course,” said 
Ty Lamorc. “Actually, they make 
an ideal couple, by Dilbian stand- 
ards. Now let’s get you back to the 
Inn before she catches you. She 
won’t follow you in there. You’re 
a Guest.” 

“Now wait—” John took a deep 
breath. “This is silly. I came out 
here to find you. I’ve found you. 
Let’s head back right now. Not to 
Humrog— ” 

“You don’t,” interrupted Ty with 
feeling, “understand a blasted 
thing about these people, Half 
Pint— I mean, Tardy.” 

“John.” 

“John, you don’t understand the 
situation. The Streamside Terror 
left me here with Boy-Is-She- 
Built because I was slowing him 
down. That Hill Bluffer of yours 
is too fast for him, and he wanted 
to be sure to be in his own clan- 
country before you caught up with 
him, in case there would be—” her 
voice faltered a little— “repercus- 
sions to what happens when you 
meet. It’s all a matter of honor, 
and that’s the point. You’re a piece 
of mail, John. Don’t you under- 



stand? The Hill Bluffer’s honor is 
involved, too.” 

“Oh,” said John. He was silent 
for a while. “You mean he’d insist 
on delivering me?” 

“What do you think?” 

“I see.” John was silent again. 
“Well, to blazes with it,” he said 
at last. “Maybe we can make it 
across a bridge and cut the ropes 
and get away from it all. We can’t 
leave you here.” 

Ty Lamorc did not reply at 
once. When she did, it was with a 
pat on his arm. 

“You’re nice,” she said softly. 
“I’ll remember that. Now get back 
to the Inn.” And then she had 
blown out the lamp and he could 
hear her go. 

1VTEXT morning, One Man was 
■* - ’ still nowhere to be seen. Nor, 
in the half hour that elapsed be- 
fore they got going, did John 
Tardy catch any glimpse of Ty, or 
a female Dilbian who might be 
Boy Is-She-Built. He mounted into 
the Hill Bluffer’s mailbag with 
his mind still engrossed by the 
happenings of the night before, 
and it continued to be engrossed 
as they began their third day of 
journey. 

They were descending now into 
a country of lower altitudes, 
though they were still in hill coun- 
try. The ground was more gently 
hollowed and crested, and several 
new varieties of trees appeared.

GALAXY 



But John had no time to con- 
sider this. He rode through the 
cool hours of the morning and 
into noon’s heat still trying to find 
a common solution to the riddles 
that occupied his mind — about 
One Man, about the abduction of 
Ty Lamorc, and about his own 
peculiar lack of briefing. 

“Tell me,” said John finally to 
the Hill Bluffer, “is it a fact no 
other Dilbian could break that 
stick of One Man’s that same 
way?” 

“Nobody ever can,” replied the 
Bluffer, as they rounded a small 
hill and plunged through a thin 
belt of trees. “Nobody ever will.” 

“Well, you know,” said John, 
“back where I come from, we have 
a trick with something called a 
phone directory—” 

He stopped. For the Hill Bluf- 
fer himself had stopped, with a 
jolt that almost pitched John from 
the mailbag. John sat up, looked 
around the Dilbian’s head — and 
stared. 

They had passed through the 
woods. They had emerged into a 
small valley in which a cluster of 
buildings stood in the brown color 
of their peeled and weathered logs, 
haphazardly about a stream that 
ran the valley’s length. Beyond 
these houses there was a sort of 
natural amphitheater made by a 
curved indentation of the far rock 
wall of the valley. Past this the 
path went when it emerged from 

THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



between the buildings and plunged 
into the trees again. 

However, none of this claimed 
John’s attention after the first sec- 
ond. He blinked, instead, at a liv- 
ing wall of five large Dilbians with 
axes. 

“Who do you think you’re stop- 
ping?” bellowed the Hill Bluffer. 

“Clan Hollow’s in full meeting,” 
responded the central axeman. 
“The Great-Grandfathers want to 
see you both. You come with us.” 
The axemen formed around the 
Bluffer and John. They led off 
down and through the village and 
beyond to the amphitheater that 
was swarming with Dilbians of all 
ages. Several hundred of them 
were there, and more accumulat- 
ing, below a ledge of rock where 
six ancient Dilbians sat. 

“This is the mail!” stormed the 
Hill Bluffer as soon as they were 
close. “Listen, you Clan Hollows—” 
“Be quiet, postman!” snapped 
the old Dilbian at the extreme 
right of the line as it faced John 
and the Bluffer. “Your honor will 
be guarded. Call the meeting.” 
“Great-Grandfathers of Clan 
Hollows, sitting in judgment upon 
a point of honor!” chanted a young 
Dilbian standing just below the 
ledge. He repeated the cry six 
times. 

r |'' HERE was a stir in the crowd. 

-*• Looking around, John saw Ty 
Lamorc. With her was a plump 

181 



young female that was most like- 
ly Boy-Is-She-Built. Boy-Is-She- 
Built was currently engaged in 
herding Ty to the foot of the 
ledge. She accomplished this and 
immediately began talking. 

“I’m Boy Is She-Built,” she an- 
nounced. 

“We know you,” said the Great- 
Grandfather on the right end. 

“I’m speaking here for the 
Streamside Terror, who’s waiting 
over at Glenn Hollow for the 
Shorty known as the Half Pint 
Posted. That Shorty over there. 
His mug has been spilled— the Ter- 
ror’s, I mean. This Shorty belongs 
to him — the male over there, I 
mean. Not that this female Shorty 
here with me doesn’t belong to 
him, too. He took her fair and 
square, and it serves those Shorties 
right. After all, nobody has more 
honor than the Terror—” 

“That’s enough,” said the judge. 
“We will decide—” 

“I should think you wouldn’t 
even have to call a meeting over 
it. After all, it’s perfectly plain—” 
“I said that’s enough! Be quiet, 
female!” roared the end judge. 

“Well?” interjected one of the 
other judges testily. “We’ve heard 
the arguments. The Shorties are 
both here. What’s left to say?” 

“Can I speak?” boomed a new 
voice, and the crowd parted to let 
One Man come up before the 
ledge of rock. The Great-Grand- 
fathers thawed visibly as only 



great men can in the company of 
their peers. 

“One Man is always welcome to 
speak,” piped an ancient who had 
not spoken before, and whose 
voice, with age, had risen almost to 
the pitch of a human baritone. 

“Thank you,” said One Man. 
He raised his head and his voice 
rose with it, carrying easily out 
over the assembled Dilbians. “Just 
think this over. That’s what I’ve 
got to say. Think deep about it— 
because it may be Clan Hollows’ 
decision here is going to be bind- 
ing on just about everybody — us 
and Shorties alike.” 

He waved to the judges and 
went back into the crowd. 

“Thanks, One Man,” said the 
right-end judge. “Now, having 
heard from everybody important 
who had something to say, here’s 
our opinion. This is a matter con- 
cerning the honor of the Stream- 
side Terror—” 

“How about me?” roared the 
Hill Bluffer. “The mail must—” 

“Hold your jaw about the mail!” 
snapped the right-end judge. “As 
I was saying, Terror’s mug was 
spilled by the Guest in Humrog. 
Quite properly, the Terror then 
spilled the mug of the Guest by 
stealing off one of the Guest’s 
househqld. This by itself is a dis- 
pute between individuals not 
touching Clan Hollows. But now 
here comes along a Shorty who 
wants to fight Terror for the stolen 



182 



GALAXY 



Shorty. And the question is, can 
Clan Hollows honorably allow the 
Terror to do so?” 

TTE paused for a moment, as if 
to let the point sink in on 
the crowd. 

“For us to do this in honor,” he 
continued, “the combat mentioned 
must be a matter of honor. And 
this point arises— is honor possible 
between a man and a Shorty? 
We Great-Grandfathers have sat 
up a full night finding an answer, 
and to do so we have had to ask 
ourselves, ‘What is a Shorty?’ 
That is, is it the same thing as us, 
a being capable of having honor 
and suffering its loss?” 

He paused again. The crowd 
muttered its interest. 

“A knotty question,” said the 
spokesman, with a touch of com- 
placency in his voice. “But your 
Great-Grandfathers have settled 
it.” 

The crowd murmured this time 
in admiration. 

“What makes honor?” de- 
manded the spokesman rhetori- 
cally. “Honor is a matter of rights 
— rights violated and rights pro- 
tected. Have the Shorties among 
us had any rights? Guest-rights, 
only. Failing Guest-rights, can one 
imagine a Shorty defending and 
maintaining its rights in our 
world?” 

A chortle broke out in the crowd 
and spread through its listening 



ranks at the picture conjured up. 

“Silence!” snapped another of 
the judges. “This is not a house- 
raising.” 

The crowd went silent. 

“Your display of bad manners,” 
said the right-end judge severely, 
“has pointed up the same conclu- 
sion we came to — by orderly 
process of discussion. It is ridicu- 
lous to suppose a Shorty existing 
as an honor-bound equal in our 
world. Accordingly, the rules of 
honor are not binding. Both Shor- 
ties here will be returned un- 
harmed to the Guest in Humrog. 
The Terror has lost no honor. The 
matter is closed.” 

He stood up. So did the other 
five Great-Grandfathers. 

“This meeting,” he said, “is 
ended.” 

“Not yet it isn’t!” bellowed the 
Hill Bluffer. 

He plunged forward to the edge 
of the rock bench, hauling John 
Tardy along by the slack in John’s 
jacket. 

“What do you all know about 
Shorties?” he demanded. “I’ve 
seen this one in action. When a 
bunch of drunks at Brittle Rock 
tried to make him do tricks like 
a performing animal, he fooled 
them all and got away. How’s 
that for defending his honor? On 
our way here, the Knobby Gorge 
Bridge was cranked up out of 
our reach. He risked his neck 
climbing up to get it down again, 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



183 



so’s not to be slowed in getting 
his paws on the Terror. How’s that 
for a willingness to defend his 
rights? I say this Shorty here’s 
as good as some of us any day. 
Maybe he isn’t any bigger’n a 
two-year-old baby,” roared the Hill 
Bluffer, “but I’m here today to tell 
you he’s all guts!” 

He spun on John. “How about 
it, Shorty? You want Greasy Face 
handed back to you like scraps 
from a plate — ” 

John’s long cogitations at last 
I paid off. These and something just 
witnessed in the Clan Meeting 
had thrown the switch he had been 
hunting for. 

“Show me that skulking Terror!” 
he shouted. 

r T , HE words had barely passed 
his lips when he felt himself 
snatched up. The free air whistled 
past his face. The Hill Bluffer had 
grabbed him in two huge hands 
and was now running toward the 
far woods with him, like a foot- 
ball player with a ball. A roar of 
voices followed them; looking 
back, John saw the whole of Clan 
Hollows in pursuit. 

John blinked. He was being 
jolted along at something like fifty 
kilometers an hour, and the crowd 
was coming along behind at the 
same rate. Or were they? For a 
long second, John hesitated, then 
allowed himself to recognize the 
inescapable fact All praise to the 



postman — the Bluffer was out- 
running them! 

John felt the thrill of competi- 
tion in his own soul. He and the 
Hill Bluffer might be worlds apart 
biologically, but, by heaven, when 
it came to real competition . 

Abruptly, the shadow of the 
further forest closed about them. 
The Hill Bluffer ran on dropped 
needles from the conifers, easing 
to a lope. John Tardy climbed 
over his shoulder into the mailbag 
and hung on. 

The forest muffled the roar of 
pursuit. They descended one side 
of a small hollow and, coming up 
the other, the Bluffer dropped to 
his usual ground-eating walk. On 
the next downslope, he ran again. 
And so he continued, alternating 
his pace as the ground shifted. 

“How far to the Terror?” asked 
John. 

“Glen Hollow,” puffed the Hill 
Bluffer. He gave the answer in 
Dilbian units that worked out to 
just under eight kilometers. 

About ten minutes later, they 
broke through a small fringe of 
trees to emerge over the lip of 
a small cuplike valley containing 
a meadow split by a stream which, 
in the meadow’s center, spread into 
a pool. The pool was a good fifty 
meters across and showed the sort 
of color that indicates a fair depth. 
By the poolside, a male Dilbian 
was just looking up at the sound 
of their approach.

John leaned forward and said 
quietly to the Hill Bluffer, “Put 
me down by the deepest part of 
the water.” Reaching to his waist, 
he loosened the buckle of the belt 
threaded through the loops on his 
pants. 

The Hill Bluffer grunted and 
continued his descent. At the 
water’s margin, some dozen meters 
from the waiting Dilbian, he 
stopped. 

“Hello, postman,” said the Dil- 
bian. 

“Hello, Terror,” answered the 
Bluffer. “Mail.” 

The Terror looked curiously 
past the Bluffer’s head at John. 

“So thafs the Half Pint Posted, 
is it?” he said. “They let you 
come?” 

“No, we just came,” said the 
Bluffer. 

While the Terror stared at John 
Tardy, John had been examining 
the Terror. The other Dilbian did 
not, at first glance, seem to live 
up to his reputation. He was big, 
but nowhere near the height of 
the Hill Bluffer, nor the awe-in- 
spiring massiveness of One Man. 
John noted, however, with an eye 
which had judged physical capa- 
bilities among his own race, the 
unusually heavy boning of the 
other’s body, the short, full neck, 
and, more revealing than any of 
these, the particularly poised bal- 
ance exhibited by the Terror’s 
thick body. 



J OHN Tardy threw one quick 
glance at the water alongside 
and slid down from the Bluffer’s 
back. The Bluffer moved off and, 
with no attempt at the amenities, 
the Streamside Terror charged. 

John turned and dived deep 
into the pool. 

He expected the Terror to fol- 
low him immediately, reasoning 
the other was too much the profes- 
sional fighter to take chances, even 
with a Shorty. And, indeed, the 
water-shock of the big body plung- 
ing in after John made him 
imagine the Terror’s great clawed 
hands all but scratching at his 
heels. John stroked desperately for 
depth and distance. He did have 
a strategy of battle, but it all de- 
pended on time and elbow room. 
He changed direction underwater, 
angled up to the surface, and, 
flinging the water from his eyes 
with a jerk of his head, looked 
around him. 

The Terror, looking the other 
way, had just broken water four 
meters off. 

John dived again and proceeded 
to get rid of boots, pants and 
jacket. He came up again prac- 
tically under the nose of the Ter- 
ror and was forced to dive once 
more. But this time, as he went 
down, he trailed from one fist the 
belt he had taken from his trous- 
ers, waving in the water like a 
dark stem of weed. 

Coming up the third time at a 

185 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



F 




fairly safe distance, John discov- 
ered the Terror had spotted him 
and was coming after him. John 
grinned to himself and dived, as 
if to hide again. But under the 
water he changed direction and 
swam directly at his opponent. He 
saw the heavy legs and arms churn- 
ing toward him overhead. They 
moved massively but relatively 
slowly through the water, and in 



this he saw the final proof he 
needed. He had guessed that, ef- 
fective as the Terror might be 
against other Dilbians, in the water 
his very size made him slow and 
clumsy in comparison to a human 
— in possibly all but straightaway 
swimming. 

Now John let his opponent pass 
him overhead. Then, as it went by, 
he grabbed the foot. And pulled.

The Terror instinctively checked 
and dived. John, flung surface- 
ward, let go and dived — this time 
behind and above the Dilbian. He 
saw the great back, the churning 
arms, and then, as the Terror 
turned once more toward the sur- 
face, John closed in, passing the 
belt around the thick neck and 
twisting its leather length tight. 

At this the Terror, choking, 

THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG 



should have headed toward the 
surface, giving John a chance to 
breathe. The Dilbian did, John got 
his breath— and there the battle 
departed from John’s plan entirely. 

John had simply failed to give 
his imagination full rein. He had, 
in spite of himself, been thinking 
of the Dilbian in human terms — 
as a very big man, a man with 
vast but not inconceivable strength. 

187 






It is not inconceivable to strangle 
a giant man with a belt. But how 
conceivable is it to strangle a 
grizzly? 

John was all but out of reach, 
stretched at arm’s-length by his 
grip on the belt, trailing like a 
lamprey attached to a lake trout. 
But now and then the Terror’s 
huge hand, beating back at him 
through the water, brushed against 
him. Only brushed — but each im- 
pact slammed John about like a 
chip in the water. His head rang. 
The water roared about him. His 
shoulder numbed to a blow and his 
ribs gave to another. 

His senses began to fog; and he 
tightened his grip on the belt — 
for it was, in the end, kill or be 
killed. If he did not do for the 
Terror, there was no doubt the 
Terror would ... do for . him . 

C HOKING and gasping, he 
found his hands no longer on 
the belt, but clawing at the grassy 
edge of the pond. Hands were help- 
ing him. He pulled himself up on 
the slippery margin. His knees 
found solid ground. He coughed 
water and was suddenly, ungrace- 
fully sick. Then he blacked out. 

He came around after an inde- 
terminate time to find his head in 
someone’s lap. He blinked upward 
and a blur of color slowly turned 
into the face of Ty Lamorc, very 
white and taut — and crying. 
“What?” he croaked. 

188 



“Oh, shut up!” she said. She was 
wiping his damp face with a rag 
of cloth that was nearly as wet as 
he was. 

“No—” he managed. “I mean— 
what’re you doing here?” He tried 
to sit up. 

“Lie down!” 

“I’m all right - I think.” He 
struggled into sitting position. The 
whole area of Glen Hollow, he 
saw, was aswarm with Dilbians. A 
short way off, a knot of them were 
gathered on the pool-bank around 
something. 

“What-?” he began. 

“The Terror, Half Pint,” said 
a familiar voice, and he looked up 
at the looming figure of the Hill 
Bluffer, mountainous from this 
angle. “He’s still out. It’s your 
fight, all right.” He went off, and 
they could hear him informing the 
other group down the bank that 
the Shorty was up and talking. 

John Tardy looked at Ty. 

“What happened?” he asked. 

“They had to pull him out. You 
made it to shore by yourself.” She 
found a handkerchief somewhere, 
wiped her eyes and blew her nose 
vigorously. “You were wonderful.” 

“Wonderful?” said John, still too 
groggy for subtlety. “I was out of 
my head to even think of it!” He 
felt his ribs gingerly. “I better get 
back to Humrog and have an X- 
ray of this side.” 

“Oh, are your ribs broken?” 

“Maybe just bruised. Wow!” 

GALAXY 



said John, coming on an especially 
tender spot. 

“Oh!” wept Ty. “You might 
have been killed! And it’s all my 
fault!” 

“Your fault?” said John. He 
spotted the massive figure of One 
Man breaking away from the 
group around the fallen Terror 
and hissed quickly at her. “Hurry. 
Help me up.” She assisted him 
clumsily to his feet. “Tell me, did 
they find anything around the 
Terror’s neck when they pulled 
him out?” 

S HE stared at him and wiped 
her eyes. “Why, no. What 
should they find around his neck?” 
“Nothing,” whispered John. 
“Well!” he said as One Man rolled 
up to a halt before them. “What 
do you think of the situation?” 

“I think, Half Pint,” said One 
Man, “that it’s all very interest- 
ing. Very interesting indeed. I 
think you Shorties may be getting 
a few takers now on this business 
of going off into the sky and 
learning things.” 

“You do, eh? How about you, 
for one?” 

“No-o,” said One Man slowly. 
“No, I don’t think me. I’m a little 
too old to jump at new things that 
quick. Some of the young ones’ll be 
ready, though. The Terror, for one, 
possibly. He’s quite a bright lad, 
you know. Of course, now that 
you’ve done the preliminary spade- 



work, I may put in a good word 
for you people here and there.” 
“Mighty nice of you — now,” 
said John, a little bitterly. 

“Nothing wins like a winner, 
Half Pint,” rumbled One Man. 
“You Shorties should have known 
that. Matter of fact, I’m surprised 
it took you so long to show some 
common sense. You just don’t 
come in and sit down at a man’s 
table and expect him to take your 
word for it that you’re one of the 
family. As I said to you once be- 
fore, who asked you Shorties to 
come here, anyway, in the first 
place? And what made you think 
we had to like you? What if, when 
you were a lad, some new kid 
moved into your village? He was 
half your size, but he had a whole 
lot of shiny new playthings you 
didn’t have, and he came up and 
tapped you on the shoulder and 
said, ‘C’mon, from now on we’ll 
play my sort of game!’ How’d you 
think you’d have felt?” 

He eyed John shrewdly out of 
his hairy face. 

“I see,” said John, after a mo- 
ment. “Then why’d you help me?” 
“Me? Help you? I was as neu- 
tral as they come. What’re you 
talking about?” 

“We’ve got something back 
home called a phone directory — 
a book like those manuals Little 
Bite has down at Humrog. It’s 
about this thick—” he measured 
with thumb and forefinger. “And 



THE MAN IN THE MAILBAG

r 



for one of us Shorties, you’d say 
it was a physical impossibility 
to pick it up and tear it in two. 
But some of us can do it.” He eyed 
One Man. “Of course, there’s a 
trick to it.” 

“Well, now,” said One Man ju- 
diciously, “I can believe it. Direc- 
tories, thick sticks, or first-class 
hill-and-alley scrappers — there’s 
a trick to handle almost any of 
them. Not that I’d ever favor a 
Shorty over any of us in the long 
run — don’t get that idea.” He 
looked around them. The Stream- 
side Terror was being helped out 
of the Glen and most of the crowd 
was already gone. “We’ll have to 
get together for a chat one of these 
days, Half Pint. Well, see you in 
the near future, Shorties.” 

J OHN Tardy wiped a damp nose 
with the back of his hand and 
stared after One Man. Then he 
turned to Ty Lamorc. 

“Now,” he said, “what’d you 
mean — it was all your fault?” 

“It was,” she said miserably. 
“It was all my idea. Earth knew 
we weren’t getting through to the 
Dilbians, so they sent me out. And 
I—” she gulped — “I recommended 
they send out a man who con- 
formed as nearly as possible to the 
Dilbian psychological profile and 
we’d get him mixed up in a Dil- 



bian emotional situation — to con- 
vince them we weren’t the utter 
little aliens we seemed to be. 
They’ve got a very unusual cul- 
ture here. They really have. I 
never thought Boy-Is-She-Built 
would catch up with you and near- 
ly kill you and take your wrist- 
phone away. You were supposed 
to be able to stay in contact with 
Joshua Guy so he could always 
rescue you from the other end.” 

“I see. And why,” queried John, 
very slowly and patiently, “did 
you decide not to let me in on 
what was going on?” 

“Because,” she wailed, “I 
thought it would be better for you 
to react like the Dilbians in a 
natural, extroverted, uncerebral 
way!” 

“I see,” said John again. They 
were still standing beside the pool. 
He picked her up — she was quite 
light and slender — and threw her 
in. There was a shriek and a satis- 
fying splash. John turned and 
walked off. 

After half a dozen steps, he 
slowed down, turned and went 
back. She was clinging to the bank. 

“Here,” he said gruffly, extend- 
ing his hand. 

“Thag you,” she said humbly, 
with her nose full of water, as he 
hauled her out.

you. If you had voted for many 
little stories at the cost of large 
ones, we’d have had no choice but 
to demand terse — even if pain- 
fully terse — handlings. 

We’re grateful that many of you 
pointed out the time factor in 
reading. A. H. Feldman of Los 
Angeles, Cal., speaks for a sizable 
and hurried group: “Please leave 
in the short stories as I can easily 
scan one in a break or lunch hour,” 
and Dorothy B. Sommers of May- 
ville, N. Y., explains harrowingly 
just why a mother of three boys 
had better have a passion for short 
stories or give up reading alto- 
gether. 

VW/'E had no intention of not 
** using short stories; they’re 
too important for editorial bal- 
ance, a word that, thanks to those 
who bothered to say why, now has 
temporal as well as length and 
theme meaning. 

• How, we asked, about serials? 
The best solution — running them 
complete in one issue— we showed 
to be financially impossible for au- 
thors: books, reprint and club pub- 
lishers won’t touch novels that 
have appeared uncut in single is- 
sues. That applies whether we are 
discussing Galaxy or Galaxy 
Novels, which some readers sug- 
gested as a way out of the prob- 
lem. If we’re going to have book- 
lengths, they must be serialized — 



and we asked our readers to con- 
sider, before voting, whether they 
would have wanted to miss the 
book-lengths we have run. 

And consider they did, for the 
really immense majority wants 
serials. We are all unhappy about 
the wait, but it’s either that or no 
book-lengths. 

Well, no, not none at all; there 
are always seconds and factory re- 
jects that can be had for the whis- 
tling, but not the top-notchers. 
Magazine earnings, especially from 
Galaxy, enable writers to turn 
good-enough books into the best 
they can produce. 

We’ll hold the serials down to 
two installments, as promised. It 
means a two-month wait — but 
isn’t that a gain over the third of 
a year needed for four-parters? 

• What, we asked, do you think 
of articles? Is our science depart- 
ment a good solution? 

Here again the choice is unmis- 
takable: Willy Ley’s “For Your In- 
formation” gets a mandate. The 
suggestions made for improving 
it still further will be heeded: 
more speculation, return of the 
“Any Questions?” section, and 
wider range of subjects. 

“Any Questions?” became a real 
problem— the scientifically literate 
and semi-literate, after a first burst 
of enthusiasm, left it entirely to 
the untutored, and how many 
times could Ley explain that 
rockets do not push against air,

and the like? If you want a depart- 
ment that depends on you for sup- 
port, it seems logical that you 
should support it, no? Keep 
queries coming and it will flourish. 
Relinquish it and it’ll wither and 
die, same as before. 

• Your editor baffledly admits 
that his editorials seem liked and 
consents to go on writing them. 
His reluctance was neither lazi- 
ness nor modesty. Being a devout 
entertainer, he lives in horror of 
lecturing and talking through his 
hat, the two greatest pitfalls of 
editorializing. His attempts to 
scrabble out of said pitfalls do not 
always succeed, and they feel less 
often than that — but you ought 
to see him chucking away ideas 
that lead to these temptations, and 
whacking out the incipient bore- 
doms or sillinesses that obstinate- 
ly creep into all editorials. 

T>UT if the editorials are liked, 
he asks, how come writing them 
feels like trying to hold a spirited 
conversation with a dead phone? 
Why, he persists, doesn’t some- 
body answer? So, when you hear 
an editorial ringing, pick it up. 
It’s for you. 

• The vote on the letter column 
couldn’t have been clearer in 1950. 
It couldn’t be more deadlocked 
than now — almost exactly half 
against and half for. The deciding 
factor is actually the same as the 
one that will make “Any Ques- 



tions?” prosper or fall — your 
support, if you are among the 
many who want a letter column, 
or leaving it by default to the — 

Well, here is the place to com- 
ment on the crabs among us men- 
tioned earlier, and the shock re- 
ceived each time we find them 
statistically so insignificant. 

At any given time, there are 
no more than 200 or so active, in 
the volcanic sense, letter writers. 
Some are loves — a few, like H. M. 
Sycamore, nothing short of living 
snookies. But the steaming, fum- 
ing, roaring most of them won’t 
get off people’s ears, editors’ least 
of all. They take over letter col- 
umns only if nobody else is 
around, for no editor prefers their 
livid lava — they’re always mad: 
mad for, mad at, or just plain mad 
— to sensible mail from reason- 
able human beings whom every- 
one is glad to hear from. 

We intended at this point to in- 
clude some samples, decided not 
to; why quease stomachs unneces- 
sarily? Besides, you’ve seen enough 
in their occupied columns. What 
you can’t really realize is how 
strenuously they have been pret- 
tied up for you in editing. Worse 
than unprintable, they are un- 
speakable. 

No, we had no intention ever 
of letting these quarrelsome oafs 
dominate any letter department 
in Galaxy. Nor is the alternative 
no letter department. Not with so

many intelligent readers to chat, 
bull or fun around with. Agree? 
Apparently 50% of you do. Now 
let’s hear from you — and keep 
hearing, for the column can exist 
only as long as you write to it 
• How, we inquired, about our 
book reviews? Another clear ma- 
jority, including endorsement of 
the tone that was deliberately set 
in advance — one early voter’s 
letter, put aside for quote, got 
quickly drifted over and buried 
and would need a rescue expedi- 
tion to be uncovered, so our apolo- 
gies for a nameless citation from 
memory: “It’s not easy to locate 
science fiction and related books 
in my town and Mr. Gale’s reviews 
make a very useful shopping list.” 

Shopping list, not public execu- 
tion block, is what we intended 
the department to be; now, as 
many readers request, we are re- 
instating coverage of paperbound 
books to extend its usefulness. 
Since these are all but complete- 
ly reprints, they will be reviewed 
briefly — no sense in discussing 
titles twice and sometimes more. 

Speaking for a hungry little 
crowd is Bruce Pelz, Tampa, Fla., 
who says: “Put more teeth in the 
reviews!” Sorry, Mr. P., this field 
has an exportable surplus of 
fanged critics, bunnies in company, 
sabertooth rabbits in print. We 
feel that as long as an author is 
writing, even if badly, there’s a 
chance he’ll improve, none at all 



if he is nipped and nagged into 
stopping. Gale will evaluate books 
as buys, not their authors’ taste 
in shirts, or in relation to James 
Joyce, or in terms of Gypsy 
Dreambook symbology. 

• Many readers want covers tied 
to stories, but many like our odd- 
ball ones, so we’ll try to please 
both factions. And we aim to dress 
up layouts and art still more. 

• Reprinting some of our early 
stories, available nowhere else, 
got a mixed vote. We’ll see if we 
can’t come up with a solution 
favorable to all. 

the really big policies, we 
have just about enough to go 
on, and we mean to go on it, at 
least until we hear otherwise, for 
the voting continues. 

There was some confusion about 
our math — half again as much 
magazine for only 15<f more. We 
meant 50% as much again as our 
130-page competitors. But the 
whole thing is in process of change 
even as this is written, with some 
titles going out of business, others 
increasing price, and the rest 
watching us very closely before 
deciding what to do. 

They will have to watch us even 
more narrowly than they are do- 
ing, though. For the plans we have 
in mind will cause them — and 
you — the utmost damned aston- 
ishment!
